To many a man the smoking of De Reszkes
has been hitherto an almost guilty indulgence of
good taste. One really couldn’t afford it—but
one did! Now here’s an end of that with
De Reszke Virginias —the famous “Cigarette for

white - and - green - and - gold packets to-day, before
your tobacconist says “Sold out!”
Every cigarette that bears the name DE RESZKE
must needs be the very best in its class; otherwise
the “goodwill” value of the name—at present beyond
compute -would be endangered. That is your
guarantee that the new De Reszke Virginias will
always preserve their present high quality.

The Felton Bequest
A fresh consignment of Art selected by
Frank Rinder, the Felton Bequest’s London
buyer, has arrived in Melbourne. Last year
the selector accompanied his pictures.
This year he sent them. Perhaps he
fancied he might have been tom to pieces.
Yet it was better to have come this year
than it will be to come next. Last year’s
lot was poor. This year’s is worse.
But with regard to prices, Mr. Rinder
has not soared so high. Last year he paid
£997 of the public’s money—for the Felton
Bequest belongs to the people—for a
ship’s deck by Manet no better than a
hundred similar exercises in realism by
Australian artists. This year he only went
as far as to splash £450 on an unfinished
sketch, or an error of judgment, or a bit
of studio debris, by A. McEvoy. McEvoy
is dead, otherwise he would probably have
long ago withdrawn this sketch from circu-
lation. If anybody has doubts about the
deplorable eccentricity of Mr. Binder's
judgment a glance at some of the portraits
by indigenous artists hanging elsewhere on
the walls should reassure him. Most of
them were bought for much smaller sums
than Mr. Rinder paid for the fragment by
McEvoy. The same belief that a hasty
chip from the shop of a European person
with a reputation is worth paying a huge
price for is manifest in the rest of the
collection. Two pictures by Bosboom
seem to suggest that the travelling agent
has had a moment of artistic enlightenment,
but the suggestion is illusory. They were
selected by National Gallery Director
Bernard Hall in Sydney.
Mr, Rinder is an elderly Scotchman on
a salary, and his honesty is not in doubt.
To understand why he consistently fails
to please anybody—except perhaps the
trustees—with his selections it is necessary
to know something of the “art practices”
•of Europe. Van Gogh, the Dutch artist,
began his career by being apprenticed to
the celebrated firm of picture salesmen,
Goupils, in London. Being an artist, he
soon began to show a splenetic humor
towards important customers of the firm.
Burning with a desire for self-expression,
he was appalled at having to create the
sales psychology that would induce a war
contractor to pay a fancy price for the
leavings of a dead man’s w.p.b: One day
in the middle of the shop he declared that
the business of dealing in pictures was
nothing less than a form of organised
robbery, and he was sacked. The art
tradesman’s attitude towards pictures has
nothing to do with art. He is like the
philatelist raving over a stamp whose price
is beyond rubies because it has an error in
spelling on its face. Nobody can turn
ordinary artistic values upside down like
those lofty gentlemen who spin their webs
for profiteers in the dim religious light of
the Bond-street and Rue de Rivoli art-
shops. : For them there is no difference,
except a monetary one, between the art of
Rubens and Velasquez, or Titian and
Giorgione. When the Cubist lunacy raged
just after the w r ar had put all the money
in the most ignorant hands the art sales-
men stocked up with pictures made of
fragments of newspaper, bits of drain-pipe,
matchboxes, dabs of mustard, tacks and
hair.
Amidst these confidence men of art Mr.
Rinder appears to be an innocent abroad.
The damage is more than appears. Money
spent in bringing good foreign works of
art into Australia is not grudged; but
every time Mr. Rinder throws £100 away
on antiquated European junk he deprives
an Australian artist of the wherewithal to
carry on his w r ork. The Felton Trust has
missed many opportunities lately, notably
in not acquiring a good Charles Wheeler
nude arid a representative Leist. It has to
pay for Mr. Binder’s indiscretions some-
how.
Most of the recent railings in the Mel-
bourne press missed the essential point,
that the constitution of the Felton Trust
is fixed by the terms of the deceased
chemist’s will and is unalterable. The
triumvirate sitting at the top are Dr. Baige,
a retired medico; Mr. Norton Grimwade,
a manufacturing chemist; and Charles
Levy, a financier. Under them is the
Felton committee, consisting of Dr. Leeper,
a retired professor; J. G. Collins, Parlia-
mentary draftsman (not of pictures but of
documents); George Swinburne and R. D.
Elliott, both engineers; and Frank Clarke,
a politician. John Longstaff and John
Shirlow have recently been elected, but
not to the art committee. Presumably
they are advising on stuffing elephants.
Art-Director Bernard Hall trots round to
local shows and makes recorrimendations,
and all or some of the committee
merated above drop in after him and
commune on his choice. None of them,
as far as is known, claims a knowledge of
art, and the triumvirate aforesaid, which
has the power of veto, would probably
enthusiastically deny any.
Under these local conditions and with the
assistance of Mr. Rinder in London, the
Felton Bequest, the noblest largesse ever
flung by Trade to Culture fin Australia, is
fast becoming a bad joke. There isn’t any
remedy except in the voluntary admission
of the honorary gentlemen in control of
the expenditure that their judgment is not
infallible and that the advice of a com-
mittee of ewperts might be advantageous.
F.S.
Leonard Merrick’s Laughter
With a pound note in my pocket I set
out to pay my quarterly respects to the
Union secretary, and several blocks before
his office came upon a bookshop where
second-hand volumes that do not always
look as if they had been chasing tin-hares
may occasionally be bought. Here I took
up one of ten volumes of Leonard Merrick
in the “authors’ edition,” all, with one ex-
ception, prefaced by contemporaries, rang-
ing from Maurice Hewlett and Chesterton
to far lesser fry. The book fell open, and
I read:—
He dropped into a chair and moaned for beer.
It was when he had swallowed it and sat thinking
of how little of it there had been....
The volumes were marked at two shillings
each, and three months later I set out with
two pounds in my pocket to pay my half-
year’s dues to the union secretary.
In the meantime I have wondered why
an author with Merrick’s attributes should
require the aid of boosting introductions by
contemporaries. Every one of his % curta in-
raisers, openly or by implication, has a shot
at explaining this, and no doubt there is a
reason why the ever-discerning public leaves
Merrick on the bookshelves. Most critics
have overlooked his laughter: where they
mention his laughter at all—and most of
them don’t—they range it on the credit
side. I do not suggest that his laughter is
not good; it is superlatively good; much
better, in my opinion, than the laughter of
Leacock (except at his very best), Wode-
house and many other acknowledged
humorists. But therein lies the rub; Mer-
rick is not an acknowledged humorist; his
humor is merely incidental, and conse-
quently it engenders distrust. For the
public—the section of it which Merrick’s
curtain-raisers have in mind—likes its
quadruped unmistakably labelled “This is
a Horse.”
There is another way in which Merrick’s
laughter possibly jeopardises his popularity.
He laughs at sentimentality. That sin is
one which the “public” will not condone.
He may laugh at an actor-manager’s
parents-in-law, yes; he may laugh at the
blatantly rich; he may laugh at any other
of the absurdities and foibles of humanity
—at anything between Heaven and Earth
but the heart of a lover. And he does that
—perhaps not so often as it seems, but the
sin is apparent, and the wages of it also.
Again, a large percentage of book-skimmers
are women, and women distrust laughter
in any form. I do not suggest that they
don’t understand or cannot appreciate
humor; they do and can, and thpt is prob-
ably why they distrust it and would rather
be without it. And when it comes to them
without a label, or even falsely labelled,
they resent it as they would a hollow bar-
gain. Men have only one attitude 'toward
laughter ; it is something to be unreservedly
enjoyed—when they understand it. The
trouble is that comparatively few of them
do. Only those who do will appreciate this
colossal truth.
And, apart from its influence upon the
popularity of his books, there is, I think, a
reason why Merrick’s laughter itself is not
widely popular. It is too wholesome. It is
without a breath of the suggestive. Also,
it is the laughter of wit—perhaps the least
popular of all laughter. There is no cap
and bells, no Stiffy and Mo, no buffoon
about Merrick. His humor is incisive,
subtle and quiet. Perhaps it is most appa-
rent in his dialogue, the side of the writer’s
technique in which he positively excels,
though—especially in the short stories—he
abounds in irresistibly funny situations.
It is Merrickian that a pleading poet,
who already owes for several months’ lodg-
ing, should then and there see and fall in
love with his landlord’s daughter. It is
Merrickian, too, that next day the poet
should meet two other lovers trying to get
a peep at the adored, and that the three'
of them should earnestly discuss which has
prior right to besiege the heart of the girl
with whom none of them is acquainted:—
“If one of us has indeed a right to bid the
others retire, we may be sure that as men of honor
we shall acknowledge the fact amicably—and you
will both make way for me.”
“What Vidlou says is just, excepting the rotten
conclusion,” declared Tricotrin.
And it is just and honorable that Tricotrin
should plead his indebtedness to her father
in his favor as a suitor. Tricotrin is one
of Merrick’s few heroes, for he does not
deal much in those gentry, and, since in one
situation the poet remarked that “in such
a pass one must be economical even of
words,” he has been my favorite hero of
fiction. May his tribe increase.
There is, of course, other sides to the
genius of Merrick. One of his curtain-
raisers claims for him that he is, like Balzac,
equally a novelist and short story writer.
I do not think this is true; his novels,
though all entertaining in the reading, seem
in retrospect almost weak, while his short
stories seem almost invariably strong. How-
ever, that is a mere matter of opinion, and
I have found no difficulty, but rather in-
creased pleasure, in reading both his stories
and his novels twice, For even his worst
books have passages that bear re-reading,
and at his best he is a refreshing writer,
whose style, as one of his curtain-raisers
(Continued on page 5.)

The Motor cyclist who wants his machine for ordinary touring wants to know whether he can
ride it for some thousands of miles with the minimum of attention, and whether the. running costs
will be low, the fuel consumption economical, if the steering is easy and the riding position
comfortable. He inquiries if the acceleration is good and the brakes powerful, and whether
every part of the machine will stand up to rough usage and difficult country. He wants reliability
and value for his money.
And it is because B.S.A. machines meet all these requirements, and because of the B.S.A,
reputation for consistent reliability and value that B.S.A. Motor Bicycles have gained such
world-wide popularity. All B.S.A, machines are British made throughout. They are scientifi-
cally designed to give a comfortable riding position and easy control, and embody every modern
feature of motor-cycle design, including front and rear internal expanding bub brakes of ample
dimensions, shock absorbers, grease gun and mechanical lubrication, 3-speed gear, etc.
There are 14 models to choose from, from 2.49h.p. to 9.SS b.p. 5 and the spotting rider who wants
speed combined with B.S.A, reliability can choose from one of three O.H.V, models.

Far removed from the nightmare of the problem

CECIL MANN.
The Bayreuth Festival
The Biihuenjestspiele at Bayreuth this
year lias been an inspiring success. In fact,
so successful that there will be another in
1928, this year’s performances being then
repeated. The festival consisted of six per-
formances of “Parsifal,” five of “ r i ristan
and Isolde” and three of “The Ring.” And
from every part of the world pilgrims have
gathered to worship at Wagner’s shrine.
The orchestra is the best I have ever
heard. The strings in particular are beyond
description. Each instrumentalist is a
soloist, and the leading musician of his
quartet, orchestra or whatever combination
he belongs to. The entire staff of musicians,
which numbers no fewer than 132, play lor
little more than the honor conferred upon
them by the invitation to participate; some
are wholly content with that.
The festival starts on July 19 and ends
on August 20. During that time there will
be 23 performances. The first three operas
of the Ring—“Das Rheingold,” “Walkiire”
and “Siegfried”—are performed on successive
days, with a full day’s rest sandwiched in
before “Gotterdammerung.” There are rest
days before and after both “Tristan and
Isolde” and “Parsifal.” The season occupies
a period of 33 days, out of which there are
10 of rest.
The operas start early in the day, all
except “Das Rheingold,” at 4 p.m.; the
exception, being but one act, begins at
5 p.m. and ends at 7.30. Act I of “Tristan”
lasts 1 hour and 20 minutes; “Parsifal” 1
hour and 55 minutes. “Gotterdammerung”
2 hours. The intervals are from 35 minutes
to an hour, the latter being allotted to
“Gotterdammerung,” which is timed as fol-
lows: Act 1, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.; act 11, 7 p.m.
to 8 p.m.; act 111, 9 p.m. to 10.15 p.m.
The theatre is on the top of a hill over-
looking the town—it is a nice walk
through an avenue of trees. Fifteen
minutes before the start some of the brass
instruments —trumpets and trombones —
mount the porch of the theatre and play
a motiv from the act following. They
then go to the back of the theatre and
repeat the theme. This is done again at
10 minutes and 5 minutes before the act
starts. Promptly to time the lights are
lowered, and thereafter no one is allowed
to even approach the stairs to the seats.
After the auditorium has been in darkness
for a few moments the performance begins.
For “Parsifal” a full minute elapses, and
it seems an hour.
There are 1344 seats, and from each a
full view of the stage is acquired. The
orchestra and conductor are invisible to
(he audience. There is a positively un-
obstructed view. There is really only one
circle, though there are two galleries—one
over the other, but neither over the main
auditorium. The acoustics are the best in
the world. Every word and sound is as
clear as a bell. The stage is much larger
than the rest of the theatre, and the light-
ing effects can only be described as re-
markable.
Of the singing, it was good, but not
strikingly good. The acting was almost
perfect. Each artist is unconscious of the
crowd; there was not a moment
when the characters turned to the audience.
One can now see why Italians are rarely in-
vited to sing at Bayreuth. The acoustic
properties are so fine that at no moment
is the orchestra dominating the voice.
The actual results in the operatic sense are
far better than at Covent Garden and
New York, though the latter spends dollars
to the cents used by the Bayreuth adminis-
tration. The musicians receive £3 10s. per
week for 10 weeks, with board. Each place
or town where the player is established
pays for the maintenance of those depend-
ent on him.
There is always a loss in the productions.
But everything is done thoroughly. If you
want to go, you write to the Festival Com-
mittee, and it will arrange rooms for you,
and set the price for them. Tickets cost
30s. for each performance (£9 for the six-
operas). The Ring must be taken in its
entirety, but “Tristan” and “Parsifal” can
be bought separately.
Wagnerian devotees have much to see
during the day. There is the famous
Wahufried, which one can visit in the morn-
ing between 10 and 11 and from 12 noon to
1 p.m. The villa is cleared from 11 till 12,
when Frau Siegfried Wagner devotes an hour
to a few specially invited guests. The writer
and his wife spent a delightful time with
the lady, who was born in London and
speaks English and German with equal
facility. The original works of Wagner, in
picture, books and music were all described'
in person to us. The charming lady spoke
in German, first apologising to us for it.
Her brightness and vivacity completely
captivated us. In the study we met many
famous people. One in particular was
Franz Stassen, who has sketched some re-
markable scenes from the “Ring.” Copies
of them are in the Biographical Museum
in the Neul Schloss, but the originals are
at Wahufried. At the back of the house is
Wagner’s grave, and as is apparently usual
the fine monument was bedecked with fresh
wreaths and laurels.
The composition of the orchestra is as
follows: 35 violins, 13 violas, 13 ’cellos, 9
D bass, 6 flutes, 5 oboes, 2 cor. Anglais, 5
clarinets, 2 bass clarinets, 4 bassoons, 1
contra-bassoon, 10 horns, 4 tenor bass tubas,
5 trumpets, 1 bass trumpet, 5 trombones, 1
contra-bass trombone, 2 contra-bass tubas,
7 harps, 3 percussion.

Preserved in Ether
While spiritualistic investigation is up
against a stone wall of general negation,
the progress of more or less mechanical
invention begins to let in what may prove
to be light upon the question. [Speech and
vision are now capable of transmission by
means independent of any apparent physi-
cal connection. The link is the all pervad-
ing ether; but ether, it must be remem-
bered, is merely a name—something
postulated to explain certain phenomena.
No one has seen, handled, analysed or
weighed ether. Something of its nature
may be demonstrated to a point, but it
remains merely an idea, and an idea as
subtle and mysterious as spirit itself—a
thing also postulated to explain many
seeming phenomena.
This mysterious ether has been employed
by science to wipe out intervening space
in relation to both sound and sight. Sound
and sight are themselves mysterious. Both
depend upon vibrations and are capable of
explanation to a point, but the exact rela-
tion of the vibrations to the brain of the
man presents mystery as deep and strange
as anything the spiritualist has ever
wrestled with. The position is, however,
that two of our most important senses are
now shown to be capable of operating in
defiance of the known laws of space and
distance. Man’s whole conscious existence
turns upon the use of five senses. If space
and distance can be similarly wiped out
in relation to the other three, or even to
any one of them, will it not go far towards
proving that man has an existence apart
from his physical environment?
I put this merely as a question. I am
by no means certain that it proves more
than that his physical environment is
different from what we conceived it to be;
but even that may be working towards
spiritual proof. Even to-day it seems like
insanity to suppose that a resident of
Sydney may be able to smell a rose bloom-
ing in a French garden; but 20 years
ago the supposition that voices might be
heard speaking at a distance of thousands
of miles seemed equally ridiculous. When
sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch are
all capable of transmission along the
mysterious and unknown ether, how far
may man regard himself as being freed
from the actual limitations of his physical
body?
Taking it for granted that the work of
all the five senses will before long be
capable of transmission on the ether, the
line of argument towards proof of spiritual
existence seems clear enough. Ether is in
theory all pervading and without limit.
Its vibrations once set in motion are con-
tinuous. Half the width of our globe
shows little or no diminution in the sound
volume sent out on this medium, and it is
presumable that the ethereal waves carry
their impulse far beyond the stars. Further,
the transmission is not instantaneous,
though very rapid. There is a definite
interval of time between speaking and
hearing. If, then, a man at the moment of
physical death has been so projected upon
the ether that he is realised by the senses
of others, hearing, seeing and even touch-
ing him at a distance, does not the reality
of that man—all by which he coidd ever
express himself—continue beyond death?
And how does this differ from the spiritual
existence, already pre-supposed by the
spiritualists?
Certainly, as thus stated, the matter
does not suggest much satisfaction in such
an existence for the man himself; but it is
easy to argue a little farther and get to an
ampler result. Modern invention has not
created wireless; it has merely discovered
it. Is it not tolerably clear that the ether
has been receiving impressions from the
beginning of time, and that the thing re-
lating to the man which is projected from
him and remaining after death is not
merely his dying moment, but all that went
before it? Following this line of thought,
there comes the larger question as to the
thing we call time. If the mysterious ether
records and maintains all vibrations—and
it seems quite reasonable to suppose that
it does so—all that has ever happened is
in a perfectly real sense still happening.
If human invention could create a bridge
between this continuously working mass of
vibrations and the brain at any single
point of human life—the kind of bridge
Marconi created—man might be fairly said
to enter into his spiritual domain. Whether
he could enter into it and maintain what
we now regard as his sanity is a different
matter.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
The Laborer and His Hire
“It’s money we want for our work,” said
the angry Australian author; “we can’t live
on debts.” Of course it’s money we want,
and, equally emphatically, we can’t live
on debts. The fact that one is a writer
is apt to injure his credit. Why should it?
Though art and business rarely go together,
some of our writers are possessed of those
things that in common, everyday business
men would be looked on as good assets.
Nevertheless, once a man puts pen to paper,
unless it is to write an order or a cheque,
business people view him with grave doubt
and bankers are chary about him. We want
to alter all that. And the way to alter it
—the only way in these strictly commercial
days—is to get more money for our work.
The question is how to get that money.
If recent reports are true it can be got
in the United States. Certainly Britain
will not help us to it. The British public
neither understands nor desires to under-
stand us and our literature—it is never tired
of saying we have none. The American,
at any rate, wants to get to know us. He
thinks that already he has seen in us some-
thing of his own outlook on life. Like
ourselves, he sometimes squirms under the
superior airs and intolerant attitude of
the Englishman. Like us, he is a lover
of the free-and-easy manners engendered by
wide spaces and life in the open air. Like
us, he feels that life is not all a matter
of tradition—a finished product of starch
and pomade. And he will take a risk.
Quite recently the head of a London pub-
lishing house of old standing and high re-
pute was in Sydney. Amongst other things
he asked a writer, who is also a politician
—such things can be—if he could produce a
ninety-thousand-word book on Labor in
Politics, or a kindred subject. The writer-
politician said he could, but. to do it pro-
perly would take about eighteen months.
What would it be worth? “That,” said
the publisher, “I cannot say. We could
not enter into a contract at any fixed price,
nor guarantee any profit. That would de-
pend entirely on sales. But we would be
very glad to have such a book from .you.”
“Well,” replied the writer, “I’m afraid I
cannot do it. We Australians are busy
making a living; we cannot afford to put
in eighteen months’ work on a book re-
quiring special knowledge and a great deal
of research work, on the possibility of being
paid.” So that book will not be written.
This is just a fair sample of the British
attitude. They want to back a certainty
without standing any part in the expense
of training it. The Americans may or may
not be more inclined to take a risk. But
one thing is certain, and that is that at the
present time U.S.A., with its hundred mil-
lion readers of English, is more interested
in our writings than is Britain, with less
than half that number, and we should try
to turn this to account. The question is,
how can it be done?

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Chinese Gongs.
The water-lilies bloomed to-day;
.So warm the sun, so deeply gold,
Each bud must straight a star unfold
And perfumed points of snow display.
And, listen! Hidden from the sun
The frog folk talk with crisp ding-dongs ;
Metallic, soft, like beaten gongs
Around the pool their signals run.
Soothed by the unremitting drone.
That skims the feathery flowering grass
As gauze-winged insects murmuring pass.
My sense is sweetly overthrown.
Through sleep-weighed eyelids now I see
A bridge square arched and lacquered red
Across a path where pilgrims tread
Beneath the pines’ black tracery.
►Soft, yet metallic, dong, ding-dong,
The temple bells beat on the air;
With austere lips that mutter prayer
The priests’ procession moves along.
Under the arch of lacquer blood
I lead tliein all, absorbed and slow.
A blue-gowned coolie bowing low
Proffers a sacred lotus bud.
I glance; then pass without a sound.
A long black hair, two threads of silk,
One scarlet, one that shines like milk.
Were round the stem in order bound.
Sing, for my heart, glad gongs of gold!
“When milk-white moon is clear to see
Above the red camellia-tree,
Your Pearl of Love you shall enfold !”
On drone the silken-vestured priests,
And I impassive pace with them.
We bear our god a diadem,
We mark this day with prayers and feasb
Beyond the dragon-guarded gate
The temple door in darkness yawns;
The steps, the holy inner lawns
Are strewn with blossoms delicate.
A sudden hiss of jealousy
Spits accusation at my ear
Then snarls it loud for all to hear—
My friend betrayed, my enemy!
Beneath the slanting yellow lid
His black eye glitters like a sloe,
He moves his folded hands as though
Within his sleeve a blade is hid.
How wild those beaten tubes of brass
Ring out to ravish and disturb!
But in its rose-veined marble curb
The lotus tank is smooth as glass.
I look within its beauty cool —
The frowning priests are swiftly gone.
My eyes awakened rest upon
The little garden lily pool.
And slowly, with a grateful thrill,
I gather up the strands of life
Snatched from the menace of a knife
It may be just in time ; but still
I might have met beneath the moon
My Pearl of Love who waits for me
By our dear red camellia-tree!
Why will our dreams break off too soon?
VICTORIA.

Age in Spring.
The day—ali me, the day is fair enough!
Too fair —it tears the heart and wakes the
mind
To memories of youth and love and joy
And things I felt when but a heedless boy.
The green, green grass is soft and sweetly
rough,
Dike velvet; and the breeze is fresh and kind,
And presses on me like a lover’s kiss —
Of which I am too old to feel the bliss.
The earth is warm and sweet from recent
rain,
The songs of happy birds are in mine ears;
But I am old, and all their dainty lays
Have lost the charm of half-forgotten days.
The sunshine warms my wrinkled brow again
And brings my weary eyes forbidden tears.
My hearing is acute, my sight is keen—
Each sense alert. But something comes be-
tween. ..
As though I saw it all through dusty glass.
And heard it through a closed and padded
door!
The sun ! The birds! But where is Youth Y
Alas!
’Tis that which, vanished once, returns no
more!

The Gates.
On this sunlit slope
Smooth and greenly-grassed,
Let n,s rest and watch
While the ships go past;
Yonder looms North Head,
Massive, mighty, tall,
Like a sentinel
Keeping watch o’er all.
Circled o’er by gulls
Hungering for prey,
Yonder lies South Reef
White with foam and spray;
’Twixt the Reef and Head,
Sought by wind and tide,
Stand the Harbor Gates,
Night and day swung wide.
Open wide were they
When through them unhailed,
Arthur Phillip’s ships
In and inward sailed —-
Sailed while questing eyes
Watched from stern to stem;
Sailed with none to give
Piloting to them.
Open wide were they
When through them there rolled
Ships that sought for wool.
Ships that sought for gold;
Ships that pioneers,
Stout and valiant, bore;
Ships of old renown,
Sailed and hailed no more.
Where yon gannet swoops,
Where yon seagull dips,
Now, as then, they stand
Open to all ships;
Ships from all the ports
Sea-worn sea-folk know,
Under sun and star
Through and through them go.

To Daffodils in Queensland.
When first I saw you there
My heart stood still,
O little flower faces,
Phantoms over the hill.
Sweet spear of leaf and sheath,
And brimming yellow cup,
Holding the dreams of earth
To Heaven up!
O daffodils, my heart.
Is full' of yellow dreams
Of mid-noon and of sun!
So strange it seems
To see you here, and caught
Into a florist’s b0w1....
0 trumpets, blow and blare!
And ring, and toll
Your sweet wild song of spring!
Awake and dance ! Arise
And set this yellow land
Dreaming of unknown skies,
Dreaming of deeds to do,
With gay heart and new mind.
(Here is no long, cold sleep,
No sweet spring wind!).
Break through the bowl, the glass!
(It makes my heart stand still
To see you there !) Go sing !
Phantoms over the hill!
Go ring and ring and ring,
Sweet bells ! O frail, pale sweets!
Tear all your silken skirts!
Teach them to dance in the streets!

The Ships.
She said: “The ships are sailing forth....
The ships go riding to the north,
And to the saffron east and by
The South-Sea roads beneath a sky
All rose of dawning, and they breast
Long rollers purple in the west....
And, oh,” she said so wistfully,
“My dreams go with them out to sea.”
She said : “The sweet spring laughs adown
The drowsy streets of this old town
Beside the sea—new blossom blows
All lilac, pearl and drifting rose ;
And from ray window I can see
The ships that lie beside the quay....
And, oh, my heart, their tall masts make
Old stifled longings stir and ache.
“For I shall never go,” she sighed,
“Out with them —oh, the singing tide
Is rising, rising; very clear
The emerald running waves I hear.
Below the high sea-wall they curl,”
She said —the little crippled girl.
And she was like a seabird white,
A white bird broken ere its flight.
She said —and her low laughter seemed
More sad than tears —“Oh, I have dreamed
Of sailing out where azure rise
New lands and strange” and her blue
eyes
Were like a grieving child’s —and she
Grew silent, shivered suddenly.
As though she felt where she lay frail
The shadowing of a sable sail.

THE CASE OF THE SKILLED
WORKER.
One of the undesirable by-products of the
arbitration-cuTO-basic-wage-fixing method of
adjusting wages is the steady tendency to
decrease the margin between the wages for
skilled and unskilled labor. The tendency
is more marked in Australia than in any
other country, owing to the large part taken
by the Labor party in government. The
heads of that party regard the develop-
ment, apparently, with equanimity. The
party’s traditional mission is to befriend the
bottom dog, and the more dogs there are
at the bottom the better are its chances on
election-day. But Labor, whether organised
industrially or politically or both, can’t be
blamed for starting the movement. It had
its origin when men of such widely differing
mental outlook as Karl Marx, Charles
Dickens and Lord Shaftesbury launched
their thunders against the hideous inhumani-
ties of the mine-owners and cotton-spinners
of their generation. The conscience of the
world was stirred, and in a decade or so
the worst barbarities of the system were
abolished. By restricting the age at which
young people could be employed, by limit-
ing the hours of labor of children and
women, and by making the terms of em-
ployment, generally, for such helpless indi-
viduals less like slavery, the cheap-labor
market was restricted and the wages of
unskilled labor rose. The margin between
the remuneration of skilled and unskilled
workers still remained so large that nobody
noticed it was narrowing. But as time
went on manufacturers and engineers could
be heard complaining in all civilised coun-
tries that it was getting increasingly diffi-
cult to recruit apprentices for skilled crafts.
* * * *
Then came the Great War, bringing in
its train a phenomenal increase in prices
and an urgent necessity for adjusting wages
so as to ensure peace at home. The prin-
ciple of the universal ‘‘basic” wage was
adopted in Maoriland by a non-Labor coali-
tion. It had been adopted in Australia
by the Federal Arbitration Court and the
tribunals of South Aus. and N. S. Wales.
As had been the experience in regard to the
“minimum” wage, which differed in respect
to each industry, the raising of the rate for
the unskilled worker carried with it no ad-
equately corresponding increase in the pay
of skilled employees. Courts and tribunals
did not care to take the responsibility of
making industry assume such a burden, and
employers—there were exceptions, of course
—took the line of least resistance. In
Maoriland. in Australia, and in every other
country where similar methods of wages-
regulation have been adopted, the harvest
is now being reaped.- At the age of 17 or
so the son of poor parents has the
choice of going to work as a manual laborer
and earning, practically from the outset,
a man’s wage, or of becoming an apprentice
to a skilled trade, serving for several years
at a comparatively low rate of pay, and
climbing by slow degrees to a wage very
little higher than he could earn without any
training whatever. The result in Australia
is exactly what might have been foreseen.
The army of unskilled labor gains recruits
in thousands each year, and governments,
to avoid widespread unemployment and
disorder, are compelled to provide work of
the sort that this army can perform. The
process involves the borrowing abroad of
vast sums of money annually and the
spending of it in a particularly wasteful and
inefficient manner. Labor governments,
realising the tactical advantages of in-
creasing the class from which they draw
most support, and of being able to distri-
bute large bodies of supporters in
electorates where they will do most
good at the polls, have no desire to
end the system and do nothing towards
ending it. Non-Labor governments, caught
in the fell clutch of circumstance, uncertain
of tenure and desperately anxious to govern
peaceably, carry on the system because
there doesn’t seem to be anything else
they can do.
The pity of it is that a large proportion
of those who drift into the army of un-
skilled labor are capable of better things.
To see lads with intelligent faces “doing
the donkey work,” as Queensland Premier
McCormack expresses it. is to be conscious
of a tragic waste of good material; and in
the settled parts of Australia the spectacle
has become all too familiar. When he is
trained and doing his honest best, the Aus-
tralian worker need fear competition from
the workers of no other country. But he
has very little incentive to get training. To
give every boy possessing sufficient intelli-
gence the opportunity of learning a skilled
craft, starting at school, and to ensure him,
as a journeyman, a wage so much bigger
than that of the untrained man that the
arrangement would seem not only fair but
attractive, would involve something
approaching a political revolution. But it
is a task that will have to be under-
taken, and the sooner the better. A first
essential would be to face the facts, which
are that Australia bases the wages paid to
unskilled labor on considerations that have
nothing to do with the value of that labor;
that the Australian standard of living, of
which so much is said, is maintained only
by drawing cheques on the Bank of Pos-
terity; that a 44-hour week is too short
to enable Australia to feed, clothe and
shelter its people and pay interest on
foreign debts unless better use is made of
the 44 hours; and that our factories and
workshops have far too small a share of
their own home market. There is a serious
excess of imports, which means, among
other things, a lamentable restriction of the
field for the skilled worker. The best way
to enlarge that field would be to curtail
imports, and the best means of curtailing-
imports, short of a direct embargo, would
be to stop borrowing abroad. Possibly one
of these fine days J. Bull and Uncle
Samuel will close their pawnshop doors
against us and the great god Empty Belly
will point the way to regeneration. But it
would hurt less to do the job ourselves.
AN ADVANCE SKETCH OF THE
REVOLUTION.
Dear Bulletin, — It is safest to accept the
view of South Australian. ex-Governor
Bridges that the Communist insurrection is
really coming than to keep bleating that
such things don’t happen in this country
There was a Red rising in the Transvaal
when Smuts was Union Prime Minister; the
Australians may have forgotten it, but the
S’Africans haven’t. A good deal might be
done here in the way of prevention by the
suppression of revolutionary schools and
literature, and by prohibiting revolutionary
organisations and red flags, on the simple
ground that inciting to murder, robbery
and the destruction of the people’s self-
governing rights isn’t permitted. But there
is too much of a tendency, even among
apparently sensible people, to listen to
threadbare gags about the inadvisability of
“sitting on the safety valve” and such like,
when the real question is one of arresting
the stoker, and putting out the fire, and
removing the imported boiler.
The insurrection will be a minority—pro-
bably a small minority—affair, of course.
Both Houses of Australia’s supreme Parlia-
ment are elected absolutely by the people.
So, save for gerrymandering and the like,
is the one State House of Queensland, the
region most infested with revolutionaries in
proportion to population. In the other
States the people’s will prevails against the
Upper House somehow or other. A majority
which knows what it wants doesn’t insurrect
in these circumstances. But small minori-
ties, even the kind existing in Russia, where
the real Communists are reckoned at under
1 per cent, of the population, can prevail,
with organisation, arms, good leadership and
freedom from serious outside interference.
A great part of the Australian insurrection,
including the common criminal element, is
likely to get out of hand early, especially
as the known leaders didn’t go to the war
to learn strategy and the way to handle
large bodies of men. That will tend to
intensify the mischief, and the organised
and immediately available forces with which
to meet an emergency are pathetically
limited. It takes very few men to set a
town on fire, but a great many are required
to put it out. Also it would require not so
very many men to wreck all the main rail-
way lines of the Commonwealth in a variety
of places, but it would take an army to
guard against the damage, or to repair, it.
How far the inevitable seamen’s strike will
succeed in putting merchant shipping out
of service to aggravate the crisis is a matter
for speculation. Probably it will succeed a
darned long way.
The insurrection will be up against the
difficulty that much of the decent element
of the community went to the war and
acquired valuable experience there, while
the indecent element stayed behind to
dabble in sedition, and learned nothing
except wickedness. And there will be other
difficulties. Great Britain didn’t take on a
thousand-million-pound war against Russia
on the skeleton chance of recovering
£800,000,000 of debts. But only a fool can
suppose that the Old Man in London
wouldn’t embark on a five-million-pound
expedition to protect the £600,000,000 that
Australia owes him publicly and privately.
Most of the Commonwealth’s population
and a great deal of its riches are within a
day’s walk of the shore. Most of the popu-
lation would hold out the glad hand. The
Old Man would be saving his own empire
from disintegration, saving his prestige and
protecting people of his own race and speech
—about 700,000 of them born in his own
country. It is possible, however, that he
wouldn’t be the first to interfere. Maori-
land is not far away. It has no earthly
use for Red flags and Red mania. It would
much dislike having a meddlesome Red
revolutionary State at its door, especially
if the untamed insurrectionists were dis-
agreeable to Maorilanders settled here and
took liberties with the Dominion’s pet
Union steamships. An outside possibility
is that the British Parliament would assert
its prerogative of making laws which bind
the whole empire and would think it neces-
sary to suspend the Australian constitutions
for a while, or amend them so as to shut
the worst characters out of political life.
That might depend on the extent and fury
of the disturbance. Anything would be
better than another possibility—to have
foreign cruisers snooping around the coast,
and foreign officers suggesting that they
might land armed parties to assist in pro-
tecting their nationals, and foreign authori-
ties proposing that, by reason of damages
sustained, they ought to be represented on
mixed tribunals created to hang the leaders
when caught.
If Australia’s loud-mouthed destruction-
ists choose to adhere to their policy of
strikes and stoppages, casual violence, bad
language and the gradual destruction of in-
dustry, they may have a long run. But it
is the kind of run which doesn’t lead them
either to great wealth or definite and recog-
nised authority. They can’t progress and
“nationalise the means of production, dis-
tribution and exchange”—in plain words,
they can’t steal everything, including the
public debt and the property of resident
and non-resident strangers—without com-
mitting themselves to a policy of wholesale
violence, and if they don’t go in for whole-
sale violence there isn’t much in the game.
It is always possible that while the old
gang is still hanging fire the criminal classes
and the trainees of revolutionary academies
may give the movement a push and take
the old gang along with them. The Com-
munist insurrection will inevitably fail, but
it may do a great deal of damage and neces-
sitate a very expensive cleaning up.—
Yours, etc., Solomon Malaprop.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Slang-Whangs Go Down.
“They’ve made it too hot,” said many a
Ma State elector before he voted on Satur-
day; and those who had “made it too hot”
were dealt with accordingly. At the 1925
general election “Lang and Labor” were re-
turned with 46 of the 90 Leg. Assembly
seats, and before long they had acquired
another (Kay’s) by purchase, while they
were always sure of “Protestant Labor”-
member Skelton’s vote. They went to the
country boasting that they would come
back with 50 seats. Their optimism was
based on the fact that the electoral
machinery was under their control and on
the expectation that what they called their
“yoomanitarian legislation” would win
them support in quarters previously hostile
or apathetic. Moreover, they were confi-
dent that the rank and file of Labor voters
would meekly accept the sentence of ex-
communication passed on Mutch, EvAtt
and others for being insufficiently Red or
servile—too dashed independent, in short.
They have been rudely undeceived.
Lang’s days as Premier are numbered.
Instead of the anticipated 50 seats he
will be lucky if he has 40. And Mutch
won Botany in spite of the most violent
efforts to keep him out; Evatt also had a
substantial majority in Balmain. The
Nationalists polled heavily in their par-
ticular districts, but did not increase their
voting strength in the House as in the cir-
cumstances they should have done. In Bondi
their “selected” candidate was badly beaten
by Jaques, M.L.A., who, though he had
represented the district as a Nationalist for
seven years, was branded as an Independent
because he refused to stand down in obedi-
ence to a so-called electorate council
consisting of 12 persons. It was the Country
party that made the gains. That party had
nine members in the last Parliament and
the redistribution scheme was not kind to
it. It ran candidates for 16 seats, is sure
of 12 and may get 15. In Monaro it
accomplished the defeat of P. V. Stokes,
Lang’s Minister of Agriculture and Syd-
ney’s Lud Mayor in 1925 and 1926.
“They made it too hot.”

The Commonwealth Savings Bank.
There is more in the partial separation of
the Commonwealth Bank and the Com-
monwealth Savings Bank than meets the
eye—partial separation because, though the
control will be divided, except that one of
the three Savings Bank Commissioners is
to be a director of the Commonwealth
Bank, the bulk of the machinery will be
still supplied by the latter institution.
In the days before James Kell retired
from the Governor’s chair, it was well
enough known that he and the Government
—the Treasurer in particular—could not
agree about a few things. The Government
wanted the Savings Bank money to be
available for house-building; and, indeed,
the people’s savings could not be applied to
a better use than to provide the people with
homes. But almost always the politician
wants to hand part of this money to people
who have no security to offer. It is no use
merely throwing at him the unquestioned
fact that the politician is hungry for x'otes;
what the more or less good man also sees
is that the man with no security to offer
is in greatest need of help. The difference
between the politician and the banker lies
in the fact that the banker denies that he
is entitled to take any avoidable chances
with the depositors’ money, no matter how
great the necessities of the would-be bor-
rower may be, whereas the politician is
prepared to make a compromise between
the safety of the deposit and what looks to
him like the public good.
The Government being, then, determined
that, the savings shall be used for house-
building, advances being made up to 90 p.c.
of value, it is doing the right thing in
making the division, so that at least the
Commonwealth Bank will not be respon-
sible for any departure from sound banking
practice. That institution is far too im-
portant a body, and far too much depends
upon the maintenance of its credit at the
highest possible point, to take any risks
with it.
As usual,, a good deal has been said in the
House about the payment of the proposed
part-time Commissioners, just as a great
deal has been said about the payment of
the directors of the Commonwealth Bank.
Why will responsible Labor men like
Scullin attach themselves to these stupid,
mean little objections? The general plan is
to assume that a director or a Commis-
sioner attends a meeting once a month, so.
if he gets £6OO a year, it is obvious that he
draws £SO a meeting. There is probably not
a director of the Commonwealth Bank who
does not give from one to two or three days
a week to the people’s service; and, as there
is not one of them who is not an expert in
his own line, it is safe to say that the public
gets from them ten times more in value
than it gives. The community owes grati-
tude to these men, not these mean pin-
pricks.
“Good Old Piddo” and the Basic Wage.
The Commission appointed by the Lang
Government to inquire into certain vague
allegations found, of course, that Mr.
Piddington is not corrupt. Nobody who
knows anything about the gentleman could
have thought otherwise for a moment. But
that is not really the matter of importance
in connection with his appointment and his
subsequent conduct. Neither is it whether
he was under the domination of the Slang-
Whangs. Mr. Piddington’s general views
on most of the matters with which the
Industrial Commissioner has to deal were.
and are, quite as w-ell known as Mr. Lang’s.
He has written acres on the subjects. He


was writing pamphlets and articles on Child
Endowment and the basic wage, for in-
stance, before Mr. Lang was known to be
at all interested in those things. Why
should he be under Mr. Lang’s domination?
Mr. Lang could be sure of being quite well
satisfied with Mr. Piddington if Mr. Pid-
dington was just himself ’and did his own
bidding.
And this is no reflection at all on Mr.
Piddington’s honor or his probity. It is
not even a reflection on his qualities as a
Judge. The trouble is that except in a
very limited sense he is not a Judge. His
most important job is to fix the minimum
or basic wage; and the basic wage depends
on what the man who fixes it regards as the
proper standard of living. Such a question
is not for a Judge to decide. It is not a
matter of weighing evidence, unless it be
evidence as to what the public desires.
Actually, however, it is laid down that the
Commissioner and his colleagues need not
take evidence at all or listen to anybody.
It is sufficient for them to say that in their
opinion—in effect, in the Commissioner’s
opinion—a man and his family ought to be
able to live in such and such a style, and
that living in such a style it will cost them
so much per week. Put the two best Judges
in Australia on this job and their opinion
might easily be pounds apart. Which shows
that this is not a Judge’s job at all. Mr.
Lang was a Labor Premier; and if in
appointing a Commissioner he did not
choose a man whose opinions would bo
likely to give his party satisfaction, then
he is less mindful of the interests of his
party than most party politicians are.
If we must have a basic wage, it conies,
then, to this, that Parliament should fix it.
No other body is entitled to impose its
opinions upon the community. If any other
body does impose its opinions upon the
community in matters of such tremendous
importance as that of the standard of living
and the basic wage, the results are liable to
be disastrous; for the opinions are very
likely to be those of extremists and fad-
dists, these being the people most energetic
in pushing their opinions forward. But
even if Parliament did the fixing, the prin-
ciple of the basic wage would be funda-
mentally wrong so long as it was governed
by the standard of living. Only one thing
can continue to govern a wage, and that is
production. We may fix a wage higher than
production warrants, and we may continue
to pay it for a while; but we can only do
it either by drawing on past production
(that is, capital) or by drawing on the
future, which means borrowing and thus re-
ducing the wages of the future. Actually,
we are doing a great deal of the latter a,t
the present time; and the people doing it
hardest or clamoring the loudest for it to be
done are the very ones who profess the
greatest concern for the children, who will
be the chief sufferers.
The Nordic Stock in Australia.
In the modern scientific demarcation the
three branches of the white race are defined
as Nordic, Alpine and Mediterranean. The
Nordics represent “a race of warriors,
sailors, pioneers and explorers” and have
from time to time imposed themselves as
the ruling power on their less dominant
neighbors. They hail from the cold north-
ern lands, where strength, courage and en-
durance are essentials to living. The Alpines
are drawh. from the highlands and inland
plains of the European continent. They
are an agrarian race, with little love of
the sea or its call to adventure. The Medi-
terraneans are the emotionalists of the
grouping. Along the blue stretch of sea
that separates the European peoples from
the colored races of Africa lie scattered a
race passionate, quickly excited, artistic,
pleasure-loving and lacking the stable
phlegm and solid physical qualities of the
Nordics.
In the essay for which he was awarded
the Harbinson-Higinbotham Scholarship
of Melbourne Uni. for 1927, Mr. J. Lyng
explores the influence of race on the popu-
lation and the development of Australia.
The general effect of his inquiries is to lead
us to believe that we are not quite as
British, in the racial sense, as the politicians
are fond of asserting. The English and the
greater part of the Scotch are predomi-
nantly Nordics. The Celtic Irish, the Welsh
and, to some extent, the Highland Scotch
contain an interfusion of Mediterranean
blood. Allowing for the whites who do not
claim British descent, Mr. Lyng arrives at
the conclusion that the white population of
Australia is 82 per cent. Nordic, 13 per cent.
Mediterranean and 5 per cent. Alpine. In
Tasmania, according to his estimate, the
Nordic element is about 3.5 per cent, above
the average. In Queensland the same ele-
ment falls nearly 4 per cent, below the
average,' whilst the Mediterranean is 2 per
cent, above the average.
This lower percentage of Nordic in
Bananaland “may,” says Mr. Lyng, “ex-
plain the fact that, politically, Queensland
for long has been the most turbulent and
unstable State in Australia.” On the other
hand, the all-round dominance of the
Nordic element may account for certain
outstanding characteristics in our people.
Tacitus relates of the Germans of his time,
true Nordics, that “they make games of
hazard serious occupation.” In Norse
mythology the place of sport is prominent.
So when complaint is made that gambling
and sport are excessive elements in Aus-
tralian life, it may be sqme consolation to
reflect that they are inherited attributes of
the most virile and energetic European
stock.
What’s Twenty Million?
The Federal Treasurer is as proud of his
scheme for advancing £20,000,000 to home-
builders, the loans being up to 90 per cent,
of the present boom value, as if it was the
first baby of its kind. At last census, lie
said at Canberra the other day, 40 per cent,
of the population lived in its own home,
subject, of course, to the frequent mortgage.
Another 12 per cent, lived under the rent-
purchase system, which often means that
some poor wretch, not-being able to rent a
home, has secured one with two debts on it.
—a first mortgage at 7 per cent., and a
second one at 10 per cent., with £lOO or so
extra put on so that the builder who holds
it may get it “discounted” by a professional
shark. The 1911 census showed 11,322
nominal owners doing the rent-purchase oi
double-headed mortgage act in JN.b.W.
alone, and by 1921 they had increased to
46,953. The percentage of dwellings occu-
pied by nominal owners (much mortgaged,
of course) and the percentage occupied by
tenants greatly decreased, but those occu-
pied by rent-purchase people rose from
34 to 111 per cent, of the total.
Later details are very badly needed in a
Ma State where about 45,000 new mortgages
of land, mostly with a building on it, are
registered annually. On a rough guess, there
should be in the Commonwealth 150,000
or more people willing to borrow between
£75,000,000 and £150,000,000 from Treasurer
Page in order to dodge the second-mortgage
trouble. If lie succeeds in abolishing the
house famine it appears inevitable that
there will be a drop in the famine values
which, along with the loan boom values,
constitute the security; but perhaps this
evil may be averted.
In N.S.W. and Queensland, where
Fair Rent laws prevail, the position may
pan out in this way: the Treasurer con-
siders the 48 per cent, of the population
which, he says, doesn’t even own a house
with two mortgages on it, as an evil to be
removed. He desires that everybody, save
the boarder, the lodger, the flatter and the
dosser, shall be tied by the leg to his own
more or less pawned home. But there will
necessarily be cases in which the beneficiary
or victim will be obliged to move, possibly
to a distance, and the proceeding will involve
obvious risks. Some of the risks are reduc-
tion of rent by the F. R. Court, inability
to collect the rent, and dilapidations. If he
finds a buyer the latter will probably want
a big mortgage. He won’t get it from
Treasurer Page’s department, for the pro-
gramme is to lend on completed property
only where it is desired to pay off a private
mortgagee. It is to be a house-building and
not a house-buying show. The buyer won’t
find anybody outside to lend anything like
90 per cent., and if the Federal scheme has
mopped up most of the savings bank funds
which aren’t locked up in State Treasurers’
securities, private loans may be dear as
well as scarce. Therefore, the outcast home
which has no credit with the cheap 90
per cent, department promises to be a
depreciated security. Possibly the dis-
gruntled owner will burn it and make a
great effort for the insurance.
However, hard thought may produce a
better and less threadbare device than the
one now advanced.
The Cranky Capital.
‘P.X.”: Up at Canberra they are struggling
hard to make the best of a bad job, and here
and there you can find a sunny soul who
even begs you to forget that it is a bad job.
All the same, if you presently hear a long,
low wail like a banshee robbed of her
infant it will come from the Federal
capital and will be a- cry to Mr. Bruce to
appoint another Commission —to discover
some new ways of killing time.
Only two or three members have homes
within the territory, and the rest don’t want
them; so they either bring their wives and
live at the Hotel Canberra or the less expen-
sive Acton, or dart up by themselves and
dig in at the Kurrajong or the Wellington,
which are more like barracks than hotels,
and go over to Parliament House for most
of their meals and their comforts. “You
may do everything but sleep here” is the
order in effect regarding Parliament House;
but any morning an attendant is liable to
find a Bridge four who, rather than face
the icy cold trudge to their diggings, have
rolled themselves up in floor-mats and
dossed on the sacred benches. The Bridge
fiend who is also a golf addict can pull
through pretty well so long as the weather
is reasonable. But the man or the woman
who has not these vices is mostly asking
his best friend what they can do to-
morrow; and for the women, Mrs. Sealing-
Wax’s tea-party next Thursday is a god-
send for a week.
So far they are good-tempered about it;
you wouldn’t know the cattiest creature in
the place had a set of claws. The daily
papers have suddenly discovered that every-
thing in Canberra is a long way from every-
thing else, and because the city suffers from
curvature of every bone in its body you
can’t reach any given point by the shortest
possible route. But perhaps the man who
was responsible for it was wiser than he
looks. Everybody who has travelled knows
what a big ship’s company is like towards
the end of a long voyage, and if Canberra
had been packed into a single settlement,
with an easy path from every dry pub to
every other dry pub, and a straight track
between every back yard and every other
back yard, Heaven only knows what .sort
of legislation might have come out of it.
If, however, you can’t give that considera-
tion any weight, then you will have to
admit that there is nothing but waste and
inconvenience in the plan of chopping up
the little community, and scattering it over
seven hills, in groups as widely separated
as possible. The theory or excuse or what-
ever it is for putting' vast spaces between
everything and everything else is that this
is going to be a great city and room must
be allowed for growth. If Smith, newly
married, carried the same idea into his
domestic architecture, and put the kitchen
down at the bottom of the block and the
living-room at the front and the bedroom
on the tip of one wing and the bathroom
on the tip of the other, somebody would
probably say that Smith was mad; and
before the first baby arrived and there was
need for extensions, Mrs. S. would most
likely have gone back to ma —especially u
Smith made it a hard and fast rule that
the lady must travel in a circle whenever
she wanted to go and see whether Smith’s
chop was burning.
Australia “the Mug’’ Again.
“Hamfat”: Professor Harrison Moore has
gone abroad to represent Australia upon an
international copyright conference. No indi-
cation has been given of the nature of his
instructions; perhaps the gentleman de-
parted without instructions, the Brtjce-Page
Government having forgotten, in this one
instance, to appoint a Royal Commission.
Yet it is certain that Australia should
demand something better than the agree-
ment at present in force or withdraw from
the Copyright Union altogether. Thirty
countries belong to this Union —the U.S.A.
significantly stood out —and all have laws
corresponding in certain features to the
Australian Copyright Act. Each country,
however, can decide the nature of the
remedies available to the holder for an in-
fringement of his copyright.
The Australian copyright law, as it
stands, is of little use to the Australian
writer, artist or composer, but traders in
foreign music have found it a means of
acquiring riches very easily. There has
arisen a so-called Performing Rights Associ-
ation, representative, for the most part, of
big musical firms and the agents of big
musical firms. The individual Australian
producer of music or song who became a
member would find his voice—and his
interest —of trifling consequence. The Per-
forming Rights Association claims to repre-
sent holders of the copyright over two mil-
lion pieces of music, and it collects a large
tribute for foreign owners. From picture-
shows alone it gets close on £lOO,OOO p.a.,
and the broadcasting stations pay £15,000
p.a. Gramophone records, piano-player rolls
and performances of copyright music in
theatres, concert and dance halls and rest-
aurants also yield a great amount in fees.
The power given under the copyright law
has practically established the A.P.R.A. as
a monopoly which can put what tax it likes
upon the amusement industries of Australia.
Its imposing revenues enable it to employ
a host of agents; and the threat of a law-
suit inclines most small men to pay up
rather than face heavier financial loss. It
struck a snag, however, when it demanded
fees from the local-government bodies to
cover songs and musical pieces ren-
dered at municipal and shire halls. By
the form of agreement signed with tenants,
the local-government bodies believe they
have protected themselves.
It is surely not to the advantage of Aus-
tralia to remain a party to a copyright
agreement which, so far from encouraging
our own art, enables foreign copyright
holders—not the original authors—to domi-
nate the situation to their own immense
profit. The U.S.A. has a better way of safe-
guarding the interests of its own people.
It declines to recognise any copyright unless
the subject of the copyright is printed in
America. This, of course, leads to piracy,
but even the pirate is more of an asset to
the country than an agent collecting tri-
bute for foreigners who control the market.
Anyway, Australia would benefit by going
in for self-protection in this field, as America
does. Its citizens and its own art should
be its main concern in any copyright legis-
lation. If it can’t secure salutary amend-
ments in that direction it should certainly
withdraw from an agreement that only
rivets upon it more tightly the shackles of
the foreign-music merchant.
*
Broken China.
Alleged information about China is plenti-
ful enough, but it doesn’t help much. The
other day the Australian League of Nations
Union (Sydney) was lectured to by a lady
described as having been “for some years
student-secretary to the Y.W.C.A.” at the
very much Europeanised port of Shanghai.
Her view was that the Chinese is the victim
of circumstances. As the report read:—
“After the disruption of the Holy Roman
Empire Europe itself passed through 200
years of misery and chaos. How much
greater a disruption has taken place in
China. A whole system of civilisation,
carefully built up for thousands of years,
has been shaken to its foundations.”
It seems insufficient somehow. The
Roman Empire went down because there
was a vast and not easily accountable land-
slide of the nations, and a general ten-
dency developed among them to head for
Rome and Constantinople as the places
most worth plundering. Among those semi-
savages who fell in torrents on the Roman
dominions were Saxons, Jutes. Angles, Scots,
Franks, Burgundians, Goths, Visigoths,
Ostrogoths, Huns, Scythians, Persians, Van-
dals and sundries. But nobody has thrown
much of a perceptible brick at China. It
has lost some thinly-peopled bits of out-
lying territory, but a State which measured
4,277,170 square miles (1,532,420 miles ol
real China and 2,744,750 miles of stolen or
contiguous “empire”) shouldn’t be mortally
damaged by minor losses. It was also
bluffed into surrendering some scraps of soil
to foreigners, who greatly improved them,
but loss of scraps is common enough.
France and Spain lost an empire apiece,
and Spain sees a stranger roosting on its
coast at Gibraltar. Denmark, Mexico, Austria
and many other States aren’t what they were.
China has certainly been unfortunate in two
penny wars during recent years, the Boxer
scrap and the J apanese disturbance; but the
losing of wars is likewise common enough, and
it was the one really great State which kept
out of the Huge Disturbance, saving life
and money thereby. Also it received a sort
of ultimatum from Japan (the famous 25,
or thereabouts “points”), but very little
damage ensued, and in Europe at that time
the ultimatum was about as common as
mud. Nobody has damaged Pekin or
wrecked Shanghai or devastated Nanking
or burned Canton in the course of the
recent troubles, except the Chinese them-
selves.
If “a whole system of civilisation, built
up for thousands of years,” has come down
wallop for so little definite and visible
cause, it doesn’t look at all like the fall of
Rome. It is more suggestive of the fall of
Humpty Dumpty. Possibly the Chinese
shed the progressive spirit a few thousand
years ago, and their civilisation settled
down to be altogether too much lacquer
and veneer and decorative crockery and
city smells and piracy and torture chamber's
anil females with distorted feet and wise old
saws from Confucius. As no foreigner
destroyed the thing, it may have simply
dropped when the night-watchman wasn’t
looking, or it may be hanging round as
usual, only somewhat obscured by dust.

“F.S.”: I suppose Australian experimenters
will try to follow in the footsteps of the
London pathologists who have been curing
g.p. patients, with doses of malaria injected
by infected anopheles mosquitoes. If so, the
chances of the insects escaping and spread-
ing the disease will have to be provided
against, for anopheles is plentiful in Aus-
tralia, though not in England. However
careful investigators are of their dangerous
stock-in-trade, they do not always succeed
in impressing their subordinates. As an in-
stance, millions of tubercle bacilli were
missed in one Australian institution, and it
was found that they had been inadvertently
thrown into the dustbin. At Sunbury and
Mont Park (Vic.) mental patients have
been treated for a long time by injecting
blood from malarial subjects. Results have
been fairly successful. The malarial’human
can be controlled and even excluded from
the country, if necessary, but the malarial
mosquito in a state of freedom is a different
proposition.
Certain Australian dailies started foaming
at the mouth last week over a yarn that the
advance proofs of an English history of the
war which had found their way to this
country contained serious reflections on the
discipline and gameness of the Anzacs at
Gallipoli. Some politicians also foamed and
spluttered, and, what is much worse, some
generals did the same without troubling to
satisfy themselves that the story of such
defamatory proofs having been received
wasn’t a grotesque and malignant lie. Now
that C. E. W. Bean has made it amply
clear that it was such, that General
Aspinall never wrote anything that could
be twisted into depreciation of the Anzacs’
braverv and resolution, and that “the
British authorities for their spontaneous
courtesy in sending us the typescript for
comment have been struck across the face,’
a lot of persons will do well to feel sorry
and ashamed for their unworthy gullibility.
The only pity is that the journalist who
started the monstrous yarn and the sen-
sational press which fostered it cannot be
called to account.

“Clifford Snook”: Re the disappearance
of Basil Riley in China (B. 29/9/’27), and
the plaint about the neglect both of the
British and the Australian Governments
to demand explanation or satisfaction, there
may be redeeming features. It is quite
possible that, if Prime Minister Bruce has
done nothing, he thinks his forces are
scanty, the scene distant, and the business
not exactly his. Riley was born in Eng-
land, was educated —in part, anjdiow- at
Oxford, and did his war service in the
British army. Moreover, he was in China
on behalf of a London paper. That the
British Government is getting busy a recent
cablegram seems to indicate, but the sup-
posed crime is only two months old. In
the case of Margary, in 1875, quoted as a
parallel, there was no doubt concerning the
death (there were really six deaths). About
14 months later the murderers were “said
to be executed,” and China was forced to
pay compensation. But in those days there
was a very tangible Government at Pekin
which could be held responsible, while now
it seems that the party who should be made
to pay is only a movable and elusive “war
lord.” Still there is hope, no matter “how
low the barometer of European prestige in
Asia has fallen.” Perhaps it hasn’t fallen
•o low as some people hope. And hasn’t
anybody time to glance at the American
barometer?

It is reckoned that the promises which
N.S.W. Premier Lang made during Septem-
ber and part of October would have involved
an expenditure, apart from ordinary out-
goings,_ of £73,500,000 in his next term of
office, if lie had got one. Yet Lang wasn't
all promises, for his performances on his
own trumpet were famous. One of his last
audible remarks before the waters closed
over his head was that the eyes of the
world were on his Government. It was
rather the nose of the world that was fas-
cinated.
One of Premier Lang’s off-hand promises,
made up in the north-west of N.S.W., was
that he would have successful search made
by himself and others for a drought-resisting
fodder vegetable of highly nutritious qualities,
and have it planted all over the dry regions,
so that troubles thereabouts would be over.
It is pleasing to know that the loss of the
Premiership need not hinder his quest for
the vegetable, which should be worth a for-
tune to the finder, not only here, but in
Sahara, Arabia, Gobi and other foreign parts
Pre-selection came in for some nasty
knocks at the N.S.W. election. Mutch in
Botany, Evatt in Balmain and Jaques in
Bondi beat the pre-selected candidates by
large majorities; Jaques actually defeated
Miss Preston Stanley by 7000 to 3000. At
the outset of his campaign Dr. Evatt sug-
gested that pre-selection should be out-
lawed. He will now have the opportunity
of moving in that direction, and he will
get plenty of support.
The new financial year began badly. The
first two months’ exports were lOf mil-
lions short of sufficient to pay for imports,
and 16 millions short of sufficient to cover
that and the foreign bill for interest.. But,
money being no object, S. M. Bruce has just
acquired a 21 years’ lease of a very expen-
sive London West End mansion for the
High Commissioner’s use. It will be hard
if this magnificence vanishes some day, and
the H.C. has to doss on a stretcher at the
office.
Close on £1,100,000 of Federal and State
income-tax due in Vic. on June 30 remained
uncollected: the Commonwealth’s share was
£715,665. The assessments were out late
in some cases, but £258,832 of the State
tax should have been paid before the accounts
were made up. Vic. Upper House, which is
being asked to sanction the raising of
£261,000 extra in income-tax, will make
copious mention of that £258,832.
G. R. Laffer, Speaker in the S. Aus. Leg.
Assembly, departed from precedent when he
gave his casting vote for the second reading
of a private members’ bill to provide for
Bible reading in Government schools. He
explained that there was a chance of the
measure being so altered in committee as to
make it acceptable to the non-contents on
the second reading, and he thought it ought
to have that chance. The bill was altered
in committee, but there was another tie, and
this time the Speaker’s vote did the usual
slaughter. Had the bill gone through there
would have been some hot debate upon the
legitimacy of Laffer’s action.
Deputations are throwing tons of informa-
tion at the Victorian Government re its
scheme for making some new ports avail-
able. One said that the dead-end railway to
the fishing centre of Port Albert stopped
three-quarters of a mile short oi the jetty,
and had done so for 35 years. It cost 255.
per ton to shift sea-food over this distance,
and there was depreciation through extra
handling, yet the extension could be done
for £5OOO. Another said that Port Welsh-
pool, another fish centre with possibilities
for big shipping, has wanted 2| miles of
railway for 25 years. All that time fish
has been going bad in carts on the road.
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES.
THE “ORATOR”: “Property is theft, comrades—all property is theft.” (Feels in pocket.)
“’Ere, lock the doors—some cow’s pinched me watch!”
The Allancock Ministry might have saved
itself if it had taken up the Outer Ports
question, but it wasn’t worth saving.
The Labor M.L.A. for Ipswich (Q.)
wailed bitterly of “victimisation” because
some of his constituents in the Government
railway workshops had been lined for hold-
ing stop-work meetings in the Government's
time. In reply, Premier McCormack men-
tioned that things had got to such a state
at Ipswich before the strike that on one
occasion the stationmaster had to let the
Sydney maihtrain in and out of the station,
the solidarity-lovers in the pointsmen’s
boxes being away at a stop-work meeting.
This childish tomfoolery of stop-work meet-
ings will lead to a tragedy yet.
When one reads the allegations about how
N.S.W. grocers were willing to pay for the
right to do a single-bottle trade, and how
people who manage these things in political
circles were quite willing to be paid, but
wanted the money in advance, which was
too risky to be thought of, it must be ad-
mitted that an Upper House is a nuisance.
Its existence renders it necessary to buy
two majorities instead of one, which is hor-
ribly expensive, and either House may ke6p
the money and then sell out to the opposite
interest, which is even worse. A single
Chamber, and a small one at that, is a
great advantage in putting through a “deal.”
Big States are an advantage also. If a
few men can sell a valuable privilege over a
great area they can naturally ask a hand-
some price.
The Labor Ministry’s followers deserted it
in Vie. Assembly the other night, and Hogan
had to rely on the Opposition to pull him
through on an amendment moved by Minister
Lemmon on the Apprenticeship Bill. All
that was proposed was that the Apprentice-
ship Commission should have discretionary
power to extend from five to six years the
term of training of the less progressive
apprentices. It was also desired to conform
to a ruling of the Fed. Arbitration Court
which had fixed six years for one trade.
Cotter raised a storm, and for a moment or
two it looked as if the Ministry, as well
as the party, was going to split. At a party
meeting in the afternoon there had been some
girding at Ministers.
The bosses of the N.S.W. National Federa-
tion have a great deal to learn about the
art of running an election, although they
have had experience enough. They were evi-
dently more intent on beating good Nation-
alists like Jaques in Bondi and Sanders in
Willoughby than on wresting seats from the
other side; and the banned Diggers made
them look foolish. In Kyde, Bankstown,
Granville, Hartley, Woollahra and other con-
stituencies which might have been won the
Nat.-Fed. candidates crashed. In less favor-
able circumstances, the Country party ousted
Stokes in Monaro, captured Lachlan and
Liverpool Plains and polled splendidly in
Young, Cootamundra and Murrumbidgee,
wherein the counts at the moment of writing
were unfinished. But the Country party
doesn’t share the stupid York-street belief
that the way to beat Labor is to give a
slavish imitation of that party and to dig
up forgotten Labor politicians as candidates.
After the S. Australian Railway Commis-
sioner had stated in his late report that the
deficit was something like £1,517.612, that
it would be a lot more under the new 44-
hour week, and that he wanted an extra
£350,000 a year for depreciation, he finished
up in this minor key
I am compelled to state that, despite painstaking
supervision and management, and economies, which
are constantly being made in all directions, our
efforts are futile in either overcoming or offsetting
these increasing expenditures and costs, which are
beyond our control.
One of the hardest buildings to repair is a
fool’s paradise when the roof and the walls
have blown away and the floor is none too

One of these darned interfering British
gentlemen whose superfluous advice is cabled
out here regardless of cost is Guy Locock,
assistant director of the Federation of
British industries. Said Guy:—
We have long felt that Australia is carrying Pro-
tection too far. We have never attempted to inter-
fere with Australia’s right to run her business in
her own way.... But while not asking for the abo-
lition of the tariff, we all feel that it is useless for
Australia to protect industries that are economically
unsound.
It can probably be argued that everything
is economically unsound in a high-wage
country, even to the wheat industry, which
is protected to prevent the Argentine occa-
sionally dumping clieap-labor wheat on us
as he did lately on the astounded Canadian.
But even if the Freetrader proves to his own
satisfaction that our industries are economi-
cally decomposed, this country must have
them. Indeed, it must have a lot more
whether someone demonstrates or doesn't
demonstrate that they are economically
putrid.
Dr. Harris, who was an honorary Minis-
ter under Farmer Allan, is the Vic. Labor
Ministry’s most caustic critic in the Uppah
Cliambah. Seemingly he can’t forgive the
Hogans for being where they are, although
there was no prospect of Richardson or
Goudie being jettisoned in his favor if the
Allancocks had kept on. The Plush House
does not appreciate soreness at loss of office.
It likes to keep up the tradition that it is
above that sort of tiling.
Now that the Vic. State superannuation
system is in operation numerous railway
officers have retired on the ground of defec-
tive eyesight or other minor troubles which
rendered them unfit for the branch of the
service in which they were engaged. The
law permits such officers to retire and (with
a pension nest-egg) take private jobs to their
taste. Attention has been called by the
Auditor-General to the possibility of employ-
ing those with minor defects in other capaci-
ties. The superannuation has a credit of
nearly £600,000, but it will require a lot of
building up to stand the strain of the com-
ing years without comparatively young
people drawing upon it.
South Africa is evidently going to plunge
again into the racial and political turmoil
which the flag question aroused last year.
Prime Minister liertzog announces his inten-
tion of shoving the original Flag Bill through
both Houses when Parliament meets on
October 15. The measure was thrown out
by the Senate. Under the Union Constitu-
tion. the thing will have to be referred to a
joint sitting of both Houses, and the Labor-
Nationalist coalition will certainly outvote
the other side. Hertzog professes to be
an opponent of racialism, but his revival of a
profitless controversy does not suggest it.
Earle Page in his Budget speech patted
the Commonwealth Treasury on the back
because its “approximate statement” of July
11 proved to be only £i2,000 out when the
figures were audited several months later.
But J. Bull’s Treasury has the year's figures
ready when midnight strikes on March 31,
the end of the financial year, and issues a
correct statement every week throughout the
year. How it is done is the Treasury’s
secret, and the Treasury guards it closely.
On June 30 the Victorian public debt
had reached £149,546,965 —an increase of
£40,447,766 in five years. Debt “not
directly returning interest” has grown from
£19,500,000 in 1924-25 to £29,300,000 in
1926-27, according to the Auditor-General.
And, despite hustings promises, Hogan and
co. propose to raise and spend £8,425,000
in 1927-28.
One of the later acts of the Lang-lVillis-
Horsington minority Ministry was to issue
a Government Gazette stating that Labor-
man McGuinness was duly qualified as a
Sydney municipal voter and alderman
whether he was or not. The qualification of
McGuinness was that his name had been
down for one of his employer’s shops, and
serious legal doubts had arisen. In fact, the
revising magistrate thought they were cer-
tainties.
THE OLD HUNTER TO HIS SON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Vie. Premier and Treasurer [Mr. Hogan) said
that big surpluses had a tendency to breed extrava-
gance. He preferred budgeting for a comparatively
small surplus and working to schedule. He did not
envy a Treasurer who had to distribute a large
credit balance.’’
“Beware the surplus, son,” the old man said,
His brow deep-furrowed by the thoughtful
years ;
“The fiscal jungle that you go to tread
I too have known; and all the starting
fears
That fill you ; men make bogies of arrears
To fright you from your path. Come they
a-nigh,
You need not falter —but it’s time for tears,
Lad, when the savage surplus you espy.”
“Beware the surplus,” gravely he intoned;
“A baby one, it might be, as a pet
Can with a sweet serenity be owned ;
But never, O my son, never forget
The smallest cub may live to get you yet,
If to curtail its waxing you be loath.
Be wise, my boy, you never will regret
You lopped the savage surplus of its growth.”
“With hungry deficits we statesmen live
And thrive; it is our paradoxic trait,
The less we have the more we have to give
In lordly lavish-handedness away.
But none, my son, could know my sick dis-
may,
Could sense the panic in my daunted soul,
If I should find I had, some dismal day,
A huge ferocious surplus to control.”
"Beware the surplus,” still the old man
wailed,
“Unless it be a very tiny one;
By fearsome teeth and claws you’ll be
assailed,
And none so feared of politicians, none.
Train on it ev’ry wild and wasteful gun
That you possess, sec that no ruth it gets,
Or one fine day you’ll wake to find, my son,
A savage surplus has devoured our debts!”

“H.J.C.” : Greek met Greek in the County
Court at Melbourne last week when Vic-
toria’s solitary female pleader essayed the
task of cross-examining a voluble female
witness. A mere he-counsel would probably
have been warned by the stream of loquacity
that the first question elicited, but Portia
persevered, only to be almost knocked off her
feet by a compound complex sentence that
was still flowing as strongly as ever at the
end of a couple of minutes. The fair pleader,
after vainly endeavoring to stem the torrent,
looked appealingly at the Judge. But Sonah.
shook his head decidedly and murmured some-
thing that sounded like “No! No! You two
can”.... The barristress sat down with a
resigned shrug of the shoulders, and the wit-
ness promptly turned her vocal batteries
upon the Judge. It was not until Sonah
broke in with “All right! You won ! that
she consented to vacate the box.

“Solomon M.”: One of the most Ameri-
can ideas imaginable is that of Henry Ford,
maker of the snub-nosed motor-car, who
proposes to spend five million dollars on a
unique museum. The intention is to uproot,
take to pieces, remove to a spacious site in
Michigan, and there re-assemble and deposit
historic houses, inns and other structures
connected with early U.S. history. Unfor-
tunately all the dollars that ever were or
ever will be won’t enable anyone to truck
along the historic atmosphere and associa-
tions. Some people might be pleased at the
convenience of being able to see Stonehenge
and the Colosseum and the River Jordan
(brought along by pipes) all in the one pad-
dock. A great many would say that it was
uninteresting and vulgar, and the inspira-
tion of a dreary intelligence and a bagman
soul. t )1(
“X.D.”: One of Melbourne’s most recent
sensations was a girl who was pounced on
by three men as she was entering a factory
at Richmond with £2OO, the wages of the
staff. A youth of 19 rushed to the rescue,
only to be deposited with the girl in the
gutter. The thieves then escaped in a stolen
Ohev. A Digger with a wounded leg pur-
sued them in another car, and after an
exciting chase blanketed them cleverly on
to a fire-alarm, which, snapping off, brought
the local fire brigade hurtling to the scene.
Owing to his war injuries the original pur-
suer was unable to follow up his strategy
and, although the fire-brigade, the police and
the patrons of a neighboring pub all took
up the chase, their efforts were unsuccess-
ful As far as is known, only one spec-
tator didn’t do his bit, and his reason wasn’t
the usual one of sympathy with crime. He
said he thought it was one of these new
moving-picture companies staging an Aus-
tralian “Harold Uloyd.”

“Uramao” : While Maoriland’s Parliament
was discussing the Singapore base the other
day a Labor member quoted Brassey as a
naval authority entitled to respect. “I think
the Right Hon. Mr. Amcry is as good an
authority as Brassey,” interjected Tam Wil-
ford. “That is a ‘brassie’ all right,” cut in
some would-be humorist. “No,” came back
Wilford smartly, “it is more like a niblick

There were angry appeals to the Speaker

time before Wilford’s voice could be heard

“Lao-dali”: Lord Somers voiced an old
complaint when, in opening a wild-flower
show in St. Hilda, he said that he had seen
many objects of great natural interest in this
country, but when he asked people m the
neighborhood about them they could usually
tell him nothing. The same opinion has been
expressed in less stately language by many
an Australian visitor to London about the
noble earl’s own fellow-countrymen. I met
a Cockney living in Bloomsbury-square who
had never been in the British Museum. As
for Australians, they will usually give an
inquirer an answer, even if it isn t the
correct one. My next-door neighbor, who
prof esses to have been a student ot native
flora since childhood, offered to identify the
shrubs growing in my garden, “That yellow
chap over there,” lie started, is called
‘bacon-’n’-eggs.’ ” After that I lost interest

“Carisbrook, Jun.”: On a recent mid-
night a Cairns (Q.) citizen walked up the
concrete steps of the post office to post a
letter, and almost stumbled over what he
at first took to be a log. After closer investi-
gation he hurriedly departed without mail-
ing his letter. Half an hour later two hys-
terical couples, returning up Abbott-streot,
from a dance, rushed into the police-station
and, between gasps, reported that a croco-
dile was waddling jauntily towards the rail-
way station. Next morning the Workmen
cleaning the drains in Lake-street saw some-
thing which made them hurriedly drop their
brooms and go into conference. The reptile, it
is conjectured, came up during the night
through the drain-pipe, and left next morn-
ing by the same route. As Cairns is on the
sea-level and spring-tides occasionally wash
up through the main street drams, the
saurian’s nocturnal jaunt is understandable.

“Kayeff”: It was elicited in a Sydney
court case the other day that certain virulent
drinks, including methylated spirits, are
expressively referred to in Surry _ Hills as
“murder soup.” The term lunatic soup,
used by the Diggers in France and generally
applied to vin Wane , seems to have been a
variant. There were other synonyms, such as
“van blouk” and “plinketty plonk,” any of
which would cause Madame Estaminet to reach
for the viti blano bottle. “Ked Ned” or
“Kaiser’s blood” signified vin rouge. If you
ordered “Kaiser’s blood with tears” in went

“Morkrum”: Since the British-Australian
Beam came into operation last April this
world’s longest “phantom” circuit has car-
ried over 4,000,000 words. The first purely
Australian application ot
Beam working is to be
between tlie mainland and
the Speck, at present
joined by cable. And it is
a fairly safe prophecy that
wherever there is consider-
able volume of telegraphy, as
between our capital cities
and larger towns, the cheap
and reliable ether-link will
soon displace the costly poles
and wires of to-day.
“X.N.0.” A few years ago one J. M.
Kenworthy, a naval authority in the House
of Commons, strongly advocated Sydney as
the Pacific base for the Iloyal Navy. It
would be a dangerous one. During the
stormy weather of last week a regular
mix-up took place in and around Darling
Harbor. The immediate cause was a 40-
m.p.h “gale.” The Maheno, Yankalilla,
Marama, Makura, Ceramic, Nambucca,
Tirana and a few wharves all figured.in the
resultant confusion. Certainly Darling
Harbor hasn’t quite so much sea-room as the
lower reaches, but the difficulties attending
a miscalculation would be just as great if
half a dozen Hoods and a Rodney or two
had been involved in a similar jostling match
between the Heads and the bridge. One of
the beauties of S.capa Plow as a war-base
was the sea-room inside which enabled the
Grand Fleet to leave harbor with elocklike
precision and eliminated all need for any
allowance for temporary hold-ups. As a com-
mercial port for ships up to the size of the
Ceramic, as a sample of foreshore scenery
and as a yachting headquarters Sydney
Harbor has no rival, but an admiral who had
to take a fleet of big and little ships to sea
would keep at least an hour in hand and
then suffer from cold shivers till the last
super-dreadnought had cleared the entrance.

“Glimpse o’ Blue”: My four-year-old

avowed sweetheart of the same age under

information. Casually commented Billy, a
typical young Australian: “Yell? Isn t He a

“Medicurse” : Not all the martyrs in the
cause of medical science have been doctors
(B. 29/9/’27). James Young, of the Patho-
logy Department at Sydney Hospital, lias
been one of the pioneers of X-ray work and
has paid for it by the loss of six fingers—*
three from each hand —and innumerable
X-ray burns on his hands and arms. He

mable value to the hospital and science.

“Wang”: Can any of your
coincidence-collectors beat this
recent happening? A man work-
ing on the scaffolding of a build-
ing in Melbourne fell from the
second storey. A lorry was stand-
ing immediately underneath, and
the driver of the lorry was atop
putting some bags of produce
into position. The craftsman
from aloft fell on him, and the
pair were carted off to hospital,
one with a broken leg and the
other with concussion and some
minor injuries. They were
placed in adjoining beds. The
lorry-driver, on regaining con-
sciousness, peered curiously
through his bandages at his fel-
low sufferer, and presently re-
cognised him in his own words,
as “the bloke who run away
with my missus 12 months ago.”
The next few minutes were busy
ones for the nurse and wards-
maids on duty. The injured
husband had thought the pair
were in another State, and but
for the accident would have
gone on thinking so.
x * *
“Barangkali”: Few men de-
serve to be more gratefully re-
membered in connection with
the chaulmoogra-oil cure for
leprosy than J. F. Rock, of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture,
who successfully obtained seeds
from the tree after travelling
thousands of miles through the
jungles of Siam and Burma.
The seeds were taken to
America and recently some of
the small trees have been
shipped to Hawaii, where a
large plantation is projected,
but it will be eight years before
they commence bearing fruit.
There is no doubt whatever
about the oil being a sovereign
specific. After a course of treat-
ment by means of intra-muscular
injections, 200 lepers have been
discharged from the main leper
settlement at Kalaupapa, on tin,
island of Molokai, and, although
they are required to attend peri-
odically for examination, not one
has had to be re-admitted to the
leper hospital. The natives of
south-eastern Asia have long
known the curative properties of
the cliaulmoogra seeds in skin
diseases, and especially leprosy,
having employed the seeds for
hundreds of years in a very pri-
mitive way.

"P.M.” : The town-crier whose
memory I cherish most was a
humorist, and one as fond of
introducing his own gags into
his lines as a spoiled actor.
Some of his interpolations were
really effective, too. I can still
recall him perambulating our
suburb and announcing in
stentorian tones: “To-night, at
S p.m., Mr. Smith, the selected
Labor candidate, will address the
electors in the Temperance ’All;
to-morrow night Mr. Jones, the
Liberal candidate, will speak at
the same time and place ; and on
Saturday next, from 8 a.m. to 8
p.m., you will ’ave the priviledge
of decidin’ which one of ’em will
be lookin’ for work next week; while at the
same ’all on Saturday night, at 8 p.m., will be
shown that great picture, ‘Why Girls Leave
’Ome,’ a picture in which I once played a
very important part—the Reason !”

“Trampas”: The “flying doctor” service
will soon be in full swing in N.Q. On April
1 next a medico, with a ’plane at his dis-
posal, will take up his headquarters at
Cloncurry under the aegis of the Aus-
tralian Board of Missions, which has raised
the necessary dough. Wireless transmitting-
sets will be supplied to distant and potential
patients, and anyone wanting Sawbones will
be able to call him up direct. The inno-
vation will be a godsend to women out back.

“Teleg.”: The Commonwealth Telegraph
Branch needs a standardised word-counting
system. The regulation says that “words
which are habitually written as one word, or
coupled by a hyphen, shall be counted as one
word, and those which are written without
any hyphen, as two or three, as the case
may be.” Under this haphazard method GPO
is one word if written so. two if written
G. PO, and three if split into G.P.O. The
receiving telegraphist’s only check on the
correctness of a message is to see that he has
the indicated number of words. It is a
modest estimate that five minutes in each
hour is wasted on every line in Australia
deciding whether “all right,” “sometime” and
hundreds of other compound words have been
counted as one or two.
* * * *
“Hinemoa”: He came out of a gate in
front of me closely followed by a red-headed
little boy. “I’ll tell mum on you,” the
youngster threatened over and over again.
After about the twentieth repetition the man
turned on his tormentor with an angry
“Shut-up, you carroty-headed little cuss.”
The boy promptly came back with “I will
tell mum on you now—l saw you kissing
Jessie Dawson.” The man swore, and was
going to give the kid a clip on the ear when
he saw me. From his heightened color I
reckoned he had been kissing Jessie.
❖ * * *
“The Hound” : Just-ordained Bishop Hart,
of Wangaratta (Vic.), is concerned at the
growing tendency to pronounce the first syl-
lable of his see “Wang” instead of “Wong.”
In a letter to the educational authorities, he
says that the practice of making the first
part rhyme with “bang” is “spreading like a
weed.” The initial “wan,” lie protests,
always has the “o” sound in correct English,
THE POLITICAL BAR-ROOM.
"N.S.W. grocers who handle wine and spirits complain that, though they put up £25 a head for
political purposes, they got no benefits, and they suggest that some other interests—probably the brewers
—outbid them”
TAMMANY LANDLORD: “Here, here, what are you chucking out a customer for?”
POLITICAL BARMAN: “It’s all right—he was interfering with the comfort of another bloke who
has more money to spend.”
and the initial “wa” generally follows the
same rule. To support his assertion, the
Bishop instances Wagga, Warrangul, Wan-
din, Wallan, Wannon, Warracknabeal, Wap-
ping, Wallace, and Watson.
* * x *
“F’nix”: Jimmy Green, president of the
Vic. A.N.A., tells the yarn as having hap-
pened in his hearing. “I want you to see
what’s wrong with my chest —there’s a
nasty feeling of tightness and the wife
reckons it ought to be seen to,” said a
casual-looking six-footer to the local medico.
Obediently the patient unshirted, and, with
a stethoscope, Half-a-Guinea listened for in-
side information. “Do you cough up any-
thing?” he presently demanded. “No blanky
fear. Doc! I belong to the lodge,” was the
quick retort.
* x x x
“Hanno”: Here and there in Sydney are
small areas in which it is totally impossible
to listen-in at any hour of the 24, the most up-
to-date receiving-set remaining irresponsive.
One of these areas is at Strathfield, on the
side which faces the Liverpool-road, and
another one is at Mosman, not far from
Middle Head-road ; there are two others also
in different parts of the northern and west-
ern suburbs. As there are no power-houses
or large electrical installations interferingly
handy, the only feasible explanation is that
the source of the trouble is somewhere in
the earth, perhaps in the form of some
mineral deposit. There are larger regions
in the State where intermittent interruption
takes place, lasting sometimes for several
days, but the reception is perfectly clear at
other times.
❖ * ❖ ❖
“X.D.”: All the leading motor thieves tell
me that it is twice as hard to pinch a cheap
car as an expensive one. The owner of a
Ford or Chev. can only just afford his neces-
sity and so he seldom forgets to lock it up.
The owner of a Safety Stutz is more likely
to be careless of his wealth. And the most
daring form of theft is often the most suc-
cessful. Two men got away with a medium-
priced car from a big Flinders-]ane garage
the other day. They had to go up to the
first floor and put it on the lift.
* * * ❖
“P.M.”: Talking of relatives in the A.I.F.
(B. 15/9/’27), our unit at one time had
three pairs of brothers in it. One lieu-
tenant had his brother, a sergeant, under
him, and to complicate things a bit further
a private serving under both of them was
the major’s brother-in-law. I recall an engi-
neer unit with four brothers in it—two ser-
geants, a corporal and a sapper. They all
came home together, too, and probably put
up a record thereby.
“Bret Vane” : Re family relationships up-
ended in war-time (B. l/9/’27). In one
M.L. unit a son was platoon-commander, his
uncle platoon-sergeant and his father just
plain sergeant. Only the first returned home.
* * * *
“Igdrasil”: Queer family relationships?
Some years ago in Queensland a widower
and his son lived on the next farm to one
occupied by a widow and her daughter. It
might have been expected that the two older
birds and the two younger ones would pair,
but what actually happened was that the
widower married the widow’s daughter, and
the widower’s son the widow. The latter
couple now have a son and the former
a daughter, and the neighbors spend their
spare time in working out the relationship
between the youngsters.
x * * *
“ILK.”: Redfern (Sydney) courthouse is
the finest of its kind in N.S.W. The entire
roof is of solid cedar baulks, and doorways,
arches, bench, canopy, dock and every other
fitting are of the same fine timber, some of it
cut from solid blocks a foot or more in thick-
ness and a number of feet in width. The
coat-of-arms over the bench is hand-carved
from a solid block of cedar. The counter
in the public office at Newtown courthouse
is a solid piece of the same wood some six
feet in width and just on 50 feet long. Tim-
ber of this description is quite unprocurable
nowadays.
* * * *
“Momus the Mocker”: Announced that
“The Potato Harvest” (or “Potato Gath-
erers”), a picture by the French artist Jules
Bastien Lepage, has been acquired in Lon-
don for the Melbourne National Gallery
from the widow of the Broken Hillionaire
George McCulloch. The price is £3500. I
was dining with McCulloch at his London
mansion one night in 1897 when he told us
of his purchase that day of “The Potato
Harvest from Joseph Duveen, the famous
London art-dealer. He had paid £lOOO for it.
McCulloch was a shrewd picture-dealer,
and made more money at the game than
most collectors of his class. Once when lie
heard that Vicot Cole was seriously ill lie
promptly bought three of that artist’s pic-
tures, which doubled in value when Cole’s
death was announced.
“Nakhoda”: Twenty miles
from Melbourne are the home-
stead and chapel of Anthony
Beale, a man of some note in his
day. Beale was paymaster to the
forces that kept an eye on Roney
at St. Helena, and he got a grant
of 350 acres at Greensborough
for his services. He was a pious
man as well as a handy one, and
the private chapel he built —of
beautiful hand-made pink bricks
—was a good deal bigger tiran
his house. You have to duck to
get under his verandah and duck
again to go through the front
door, and if the giant banksia
that embraces the establishment
let go it would probably col-
lapse, for it is over 90 years
old. But the chapel is in beau-
tiful order, though the pink
bricks have disappeared under
a coat of plaster. It contains
a tablet to three great-grand-
sons who died in the war. A
grandson and two grandchildren
still work 300 acres of the
original grant. Another inter-
esting antiquity is a willow. It
is a direct descendant of one
that shaded Napoleon’s grave.
And almost every other willow
in Victoria, according to its
owner, grew from a cutting
from this historic tree.
:j: * *
“W.N.”: A well-known race-
course parasite in Maoriland
adopted what must be almost
the most ingenious method on
record of getting a free railway
ride. Entering the station
almost penniless, he caught
sight of a uniformed policeman,
also bound for the races.
Promptly he followed the man
in blue into the (corridor) train
and sat down beside him. Then
he took off his overcoat and
rolled it round his hands like a
muff. When the guard came
along to see the tickets, the
spieler assumed a ’woebegone
expression and nodded his head
meaningly towards the con-
stable. The guard jumped to
the conclusion that he was
meant to jump to and passed
on. The John Hop saw the by-
play, but, being a good sport, he
let the bluff work.
* x x
“Brom”: The difference be-
tween a Government official and
an ordinary traveller is forcibly
impressed on those who drop off
the Melbourne express at Goul-
burn in the early morning on
their way to Canberra. For
the private citizen there is no
breakfast beyond the pale sand-
wich or pie with the half-hearted
tea handed over the counter of
the refreshment-room; but for
Commonwealth employees bound
for the Capital the ponderous
doors of the dining-room swing
open, and a red ticket (thought-
fully provided in Melbourne) is
the sesame to a joyous spread of
ham and eggs, grills and omel-
ettes, with buttered toast and
marmalade to top it off. I don t
grudge the favored ones pro-
vender, but to sit out on the
bleak platform and be allowed
only a Peter Doody smell of
the repast is to realise all of a
sudden the insignificance of
being merely a taxpayer.
* x *
“Lao-dah”: The circum-con-
tinental motor tourists who re-
cently returned to Melbourne
found some children in Central Australia 10
years of age who didn’t know what rain was
like. It had rained seven years previously,
but their memories didn't go back as far as
that.
A MATTER OF ACCENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ ‘Several times I have been approached on- a race-
course by “whisperers” who told me about all sorts
of good things,’ said Mr. Alliger, P.M., at the
Ballarat City Court. ‘Your Worship does not look
like a mug,’ commented Mr. Lazarus.”
Oh, were they born of wise intent,
Those words in distant Ballarat?
Shrewd counsel aiding argument
By flattery so smooth and pat;
And did he say, with aspect smug,
“Your Worship docs not look a mug”?
Or did he voice a vast surprise,
As if lie failed to understand
How any with unclouded eyes
Could so have blundered out of hand,
And murmur, with astonished shrug.
“Your Worship does not look a mug" "l
Or was it affirmation stout,
The fair and forthright word of one
That argues fact beyond a doubt, •
As who would say, “That is the sun,”
And needs no proof from law-books dug—
“ Your Worship does not look a mug!”
Or did he —would I could suppress
A fear that it was none of these !
I seem to hear the fatal stress
Laid otherwise, sans thought
to please.
Ah, did he say, that legal plug,
“Your Worship does not luolc
a mug?”
VICTORIA.
HASEN.
KISSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The melting lips of Flora Nell
Are oh, so sweet I scarce can tell
What riches to my mind they bring
Of melodies and gifts of spring.
Pink Rose may tip a kiss to me
On fragrant mouth of ecstasy.
The fresh soft touch of Flora Nell
Seems on my soul to work some spell.
Though passion-hungry Paula may
A moment all m.v worries stay,
And full responsive Ella quell
My thirst awhile, she is not Nell.
Languid Louise and meek Maureen,
T love them all and some between.
Rut she’s mine own. my Flora Nell,
Just three years old, but don’t you tell.

“Macess" : Some of these “view-mat.” ads.
offer a wide field for speculation. Take
the following, for instance, from Melbourne
Argus : "Young lady, dark, attractive, desires
meet tall gentleman, between 30 and 40
years, possessing own teeth and a well-
seasoned sense of humor.” At first I was
inclined to think that the teeth-and-hum<>r
part must be intended to convey an unex-
pected and courageously-frank hint as to
the lady’s cooking. But deeper thinking leads
me to a more tragic view. I seem to hear
sad echoes of a previous busted romance, to
see another tall (upper-and-lower-plated)
gentleman so ill-seasoned of humor as to
become embittered because a lady laughed
whenever his teeth fell into the soup.
.** * *
“Nakhoda”: The attempt to control bush-
fires within a radius of (10 miles of Melbourne
by a volunteer brigade reminds me that
Shanghai, a city as big as Sydney and twice
as combustible, is protected by a volunteer
brigade, mainly British. If a red light sud-
denly flashes on in a theatre and a dozen
young men in evening-dress leave their girls
and make swiftly for the exit, or if a bell
starts tolling and your partner flings down his
racquet and tears out of sight—well, you
know a fire is on. The fireman doesn’t go to
the fire-station ; he goes to the blaze, know-
ing that his Chinese boy will already be
there, with his helmet, hatchet, etc., and that
other volunteers will already have fetched the
engine. There are plenty of critics of the
institution, but more who applaud—and the
insurance companies seem satisfied.
* * * *
“Momus": A resident of Ballan (Vic.),
where the beam wireless station works with
London, wished to talk to a friend in Mel-
bourne over the telephone. Failing to raise
his man on the instrument, lie conceived the
bright idea of asking a pal in the Ballan
beam office to send a message to the London
station requesting that the Melbourne man
should be “beamed” to answer the telephone.
It worked all right, too, and the pair had
a long trunk-line yarn.
* * * *
“Joey” : Some idea of the ruthless butchery
of native-bears and ’possum's which followed
on the Queensland Government’s decision to
call off the close season for a month may
be gained by the experience of a girl living
on a Centrai-Queensland station who
recently set out to rescue the abandoned
joeys left helpless' by the murder of their
mothers. In a few days she had gathered
25 young ’possums, old enough to be nursed.
These, with daily additions, are now being
reared to an age when they can be turned
out into the bush again. The orphans were '
picked up wandering about on the ground,
or perched in saplings or in tree pipes
whither they had climbed; the guide to their
whereabouts was the skinned body of the
mother, near by. How many thousands
perished unrescued, or too feeble to survive,
or even unable to leave the pouch, can only
be conjectured.
AFTER THE THIRD DRINK.
“Juliette looks very spirituelle to-night, don't you think?”
“Qu true, qid’ true. Less material about her than any other g-girl in the room."
“C.Q.” : The plaintiff in a claim for £5OO
damages against a motorist at Geelong was
named Robert Little Chance. In an all-in
street contest in a Melbourne suburb a Mrs.
Kille conquered Mrs. Conquest.
* -Jf #
“Tasmaniac” : The Speck claims to possess
the oldest timepiece in the Commonwealth.
It is a watch owned by one Thomas, of
Lindisfarne, which was made by Claudius, of
Liverpool, whose firm closed down more than
200 years ago. It was formerly the property
of a collector of curios in Melbourne. The
venerable ticker keeps excellent time.
* * * *
“Ilinemoa” : The queer-accident stakes will
never close for lack of entries. A 15-year-
old boy in Christchurch (M.L.) went into
a shed to paint his bicycle. The frame of
an old bicycle was hanging from the roof,
and he stood on a box to get down a spare
part from it. Also hanging from the ceiling
was a skipping-i-ope which had just been
flung over a couple of small nails. When
the boy stood on the box to reach the bicycle,
by some extraordinary combination of cir-
cumstances the rope coiled round his neck
and hanged him. There were no knots in
the rope to hold it taut, but the ground
underneath the boy was slightly uneven.
“Arradni” : Isn’t it about time we had a
National Anthem of our own? I yield to
no-one in patriotism, but I admit that I
should like to see “God Save the King” re-
served for high occasions; there is something
unseemly about the stereotyped appeal to the
Deity by musicians with their minds on last
trams and trains, whilst theatre and picture-
show patrons push and scramble to exits.
Some of the States have evolved anthems of
their own, but they are little-known and of
no great merit. The Federal Government is
even now offering a prize for a design for the
new Federal coat-of-arms ; it might do worse
than offer another prize for a suitable Aus-
tralian anthem.
❖ % ❖
“Geoloin” : If the sanitary workers of our
cities occasionally annex something not in-
tended for them (B. 8/9/’27) they are also
liable to lose their fair dues. A few days
before last Christmas our household received
the usual reminder in the customary doggerel
rhyme. On Christmas eve the wife and I
returned home late, and it was only the
rumble of the tumbril along the street that re-
called my obligations. Hastily seizing a couple
of bottles of ale and a packet. of biscuits, I
just had time to place them where they couldn’t
be overlooked while the nocturnal operators
were unfastening the back gate. A day or
two later I overheard a wordy altercation
between my next-door neighbor and the
driver of the garbage cart, and was sur-
prised, and perhaps mildly gratified, to hear
the latter referring to me as “the only
blanky gentleman in the lousy street.” Later
it transpired an ex-employee of the sanitary
service, who was wise to the Christmas cheer
procedure, had come along a little in advance
of the pilgrims and mopped up every tribute
except my last-minute one.
❖ ❖ ❖ *
“Feng-Shui” : The League of Nations has
lately been making a fuss about the recru-
descence of opium in China, but there are
indications that the next generation of Celes-
tials will be following the rest of the world
and drinking spirits. The reason is that real
opium is prohibitively dear, while the price
of the local brand of “whisky” would make
an Australian’s eyes drop out. It arrives as
ordinary rectified alcohol from the Dutch
East Indies, and, diluted with a solution of
drain-water and burnt sugar, costs roughly
threepence halfpenny a bottle to produce.
The trade knows it as “Hongkew” and labels
it “Scotch” or “Irish,” and it is guaranteed
to burn the slippers off a Chinaman in 40
seconds.
* * * *
“Hamer” : The drift to the city isn’t con-
fined to humans ; even the hawk, a bird that
lias been almost typical of wild life, has
discovered that the numerous pigeou colonies
of Sydney provide it with easy meals, and
is turning the knowledge to account. The
other morning I saw three of the birds
together on a lofty building. But they hunt
singly, like most feathered marauders.
* Ht *
“P.M.”: An ex-A.I.F. captain, on a holi-
day, encountered a former member of his
unit fishing in the Murray the other day.
the pair yarned for a while about old
battles, before the Digger pulled his line
in. He was using his D.C.M. as a sinker!
“Iford”: Australians often profess to be
quite unable to understand why so many
Englishmen pronounce “Derby” as if it were
spelled “Darby.” But why is it that so many
Australians, almost all whom I have ever
heard using the word, pronounce “bream"
as if it were spelled “brim”? The habit lias
gone so far that some bard rhymed it with
“him” in last week’s Bulletin. Yet the fish
in England is still sounded as it is spelled.
For proof I submit a quotation from some
minor poet’s apostrophe to Father Thames in
his upper reaches :
See how deliciously, coyly, capriciously
Babble thy floods, bearing barbel and bream
Onward to lock-gates where beerily, viciously
Bargees blaspheme.
Where did “brim” come from, and why its
vogue in this part of the world?
UP NORTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The clouds banked up in the west last night,
and Boreas hummed a tune
That sounded less like a lilt of spring than
a gloomy dirge of June.
Above Suburbia’s red-tiled roofs the black
tarpaulin spread,
As I sought a book and a cosy nook. “It
will rain to-night, I said.
The wife a hand on the window laid, and
cautiously peering forth.
“ ’Twill do the world of good,” she said, “if
they only get it up north —
Then can do with some rain up north.”
If they only get it up north, dear girl—if
they get rain up north,!
You may rest assured it is needed there,
Where the dams arc dry and the plains are
bare,
And all looks drear and swarth.
Though your furthest north, may be North
Fitzroy
You can hear the heartfelt sighs of joy
When the grim drought breaks in the North.
The morning broke o'er a sodden scene in my
suburb drab and dull,
Brown water lying about in pools, and chan-
nels all running full.
“Ronzer rain,” said the draper’s clerk, as
together we hastened down
To catch the ’bus that the pair of us each
morning takes to town ;
"If they only get it up north they’re right—
’twill save th’ wheat, you know ;
"And up where the paddocks are parched and
brown the sweet spring grass will grow,
Up north the grass will grow.”
I’ve witnessed scenes on these northern
plains that almost made me weep,
Seen settlers lopping the limbs of trees to
feed their starving sheep;
I’ve seen the willy-willies dance and carry
the red dust high ;
With paddocks as bare as a city square, and
creeks and billabongs dry;
I’ve seen strong horses grow thin and weak,
and cattle perish from thirst,
And, watching their struggles, I asked myself
if this was a land accursed.
Was the North a land accursed?
But this self-same land I have seen again
when the season smiled serene,
Rich with verdure on every hand-—trans-
formed to a sea of green ;
Green of the grass that had grown again—
more grass than the stock could eat;
And the waving field that soon would yield
its tribute of golden wheat.
WHEN THE CAT’S AWAY.
“Billy looks very lonely these days.”
“Yes. His wife’s hack.”
I’ve seen the North in its varied moods as
I’ve wandered back and forth,
Cruel and kind is that wonderland that we
vaguely term “the North,”
The land that we call “the North.”
If they’ve had this rain in the North, me lad
—if it’s only rained in the North,
The creeks and rivers again will flow,
And the young green wheat and the grass
will grow,
And the orchards blossom forth ;
' The blue alfalfa will shed its scent,
And the cattle graze to their hearts’ content,
When the grim drought breaks in the North.

Net profits step along nicely. Business has
continued to grow, and the management has
continued to exhibit that rather rare com-
bination—imagination and foresight with a
practical care for details. Certainly the pace
has slackened so far as increase of profits
is concerned, but that tvas to be expected,
considering the substantial additions to the
interest-bearing debt and the large amount
of money unproductive in the unfinished
home which the co. is building for itself.
Indeed, some of the overhead in connection
AAuth the Elizabeth-street property has been
met out of revenue from the old George-
street business—the co. has been in the
same spot for the past 89 years. But even
Avith these handicaps the profits were so good
that the divs. called for only a shade over
TO p.c. of the net earnings, the balance
(£31.791) carrying reserves up to £318,719,
equal to 31.8 p.c. of the million of capital.
In the last six years no less than £168,304
of profits have been put by. After deducting
the pref. requirements the balance of last
year's net earnings was equal to 16 p.c. on
the average ordinary capital compared with
j TJ. 16.1, 15.8, 14.6 and 13.7 p.c. back to
Chief interest at the moment is in the
remoA'al of the business to its big new 11-
storeyed home opposite St. James (City Rail-
way) Station. In the last two years the nexv
premises have swallowed up £577.000. To
see the work to completion 200,000 new £1
shares, half in 7i p.c. prefs. and the balance
in ords., were issued last December. They
brought with them £25,000 of premiums, and

Despite an increase of £107,736 in the debt
and a shrinkage of £36,221 in the cash and
investments, the liquid position was still
strong. Including stocks, the more or less
liquid surplus amounted to £329,488, com-
pared with £468,027 a year earlier. Stocks
were a trifle lower, but a growth of £23,722
in the London credit indicates an early in-
crease in their total. The co. expects to do
its Christmas trade in the new premises,
Avliere a large increase in turnover is anti-
cipated. But overhead will increase, stocks
will call for a heavy outlay and much will
depend upon the buying, management and the
extent to which the old connections can be
expanded. The co. will continue in business
at the old address; portion of the property—
it is partly freehold and partly leasehold —is
to be used as a men’s clothing stores. The
scrip is popular on the market, which values
the ords. at 30s. At that figure the investor
gets a shade under 7 p.c., after allowing for
the div. (Is.), and the security amounts to
30s. Bd. in net tangibles. The prefs. are
well protected. Last year’s net profit was
4 2 times their combined div. requirements.
and the cover for the firsts was £S 15s. lOd.
per share and for the seconds £4 13s. 6d. per
share. The former are valued at par and the
latter at 225. 6d.

For the past half-dozen years Walker’s plant
lias been working overtime, largely on
account of big Government contracts ; share-
holders have received an average of 16 p.c.
p.a., including two bonuses, and the net
increase in the insurance, equalisation and
general reserves, included in the table, was
£31,413. The liquid surplus climbed from
£63,510 in 1920 to £193,443 in 1926. Last
year the board decided that it could with
safety distribute part of the accumulation
and handed out one £lO war bond for every
40 shares held. That was equal to ss. per
share, or £31,000-odd. The equalisation re-
serve was dipped into for £7988, and the
balance was fished out of inner reserves.
This distribution is, of course, included in
the past six years’ history mentioned above.
Since 1923 each year’s carry forward has
been quietly slipped away, the lot totalling
£24,674; hence the ease with which the
most recent distribution has been made.
In plain words, net earnings have been
at least that much better than the
table shows, the table being of course
based on the published accounts. As to
whether profits ought to be hidden in this
fashion opinions will perhaps always differ.
The trouble is that one can never swear that
something which looks like profit is profit
—anyway, not until years later. In this
case many serious contingencies had to be
provided for on account of uncompleted con-
tracts ; so the piling up inside of what turn
out to be profits can easily be forgiven.
The last of the 30 locos, for the Queens-
land Government has passed out of the
works, a hopper dredge contract is complete,
and at June 30 Avork in progress amounted
to less than half the previous year’s figure.
.There were no big orders in sight either a
month ago. The plant has been to a great
extent remodelled, which means a reduction
in machine costs; and that should make it
less difficult to win business when it offers.
Labor rule., by piling up costs in the wages
and taxation bills, has, howe\ 7 er, put big
obstacles in the way. Last year £21,331
was spent on plant and £19,000 was written
off out of the replacement account (now
£11.000). Thus, fixed assets stand in the
books at £53,240 —£2332 less than at the
close of the previous accounts. The depre-
ciation reserve (£50,500), additions to which
are shown as written off in the table, is
over 60 p.c. of the book value of the assets
concerned; and there is £lO,OOO in a sus-
pense account.
Here is a IO years’ survey of balance-
sheet figures (fixed assets are shown less
the depreciation account ) :

The bonus and the works items reduced the
liquid, surplus by £24,617 to £168,826, equal
to 275. 2d. per share. There is another
ss. 3d. per share in the fixed assets as per
table. The market values the undertaking
on an 8 p.c. basis and gives 255. for the
fully-paid £1 shares.

} be increase in net earnings came largely
from the concrete lining of pipes to fill con-
tracts won by Hume Steel, Ltd. A steady
growth in the sale of the co.’s own products
throughout Australia and Maoriland helped
also, and the Singapore subsidiary paid 8
p.c. compared with 10 p.c. in the previous
year. The accounts claim a profit of £60,884,
but £lO,OOO of that was set aside to meet
taxation and £3OOO was dropped into the
plant depreciation reserves (£5000). The
latter may be genuine profit, seeing that on
the other side of the sheet plant, etc., is in
at £164,937, or £16,306 less than at the pre-
vious balance. Its real worth, of course, is
what it can earn. The £47,884 netted last
year was equal to 9.5 p.c. of paid capital
compared with 8, 8.5, 3.7, 12.4, 13.5 and 6.1
p.c. back to 1921. Over the same period
shareholders have received an average of
61 p.c. p.a., and of the £110,827 of capital
originally represented by intangibles £53,864
has been replaced by solid assets out of pro-
fits. Balance-sheet figures for the past six
years compare as follows:—-
1921. 1926. 1927.
Paid capital .. £322,515 £500,000 £500,000
Liabilities .. .. 117,395 98,500 104,207

Cash, etc 17,178 21,120 14,176
Shares in other cos 46,825 54,077 54,077
An increase of £32,899 in book debts and
uncompleted work suggests that trade was
a little brighter. To meet that outlay and
an increase of £7215 in stocks (£76,393),
only £5707 was tacked on to the debt
(£104,207), The co’s liabilities amount to
two-thirds of the book debts, cash. etc.;
so the financial position is easy enough. No
mention is made of any further outlay on
the old co.’s contracts, which had eaten up
£52,500 in maintenance, etc., to the close
of the 1926 accounts; an end to the expen-
diture was then declared to be in sight.
Good progress has been made with the sale
of Hume foreign patents, the rights of which
were sold to an English co. in 1920 for
countries outside Australia. Maoriland, S.
Africa and India. The English concern
lacked the energy of the Australian co.; so
the latter secured an agency agreement under
which since 1925 it has sold licenses on a
cash plus royalty basis in Canada, U.S.A.,
the principal South American republics,
Honolulu, Manila and Japan. These con-
tracts did not benefit the last accounts,
but increasing returns commencing with
the current year are expected. The
Singapore co. is making good progress and
its immediate outlook has much promise in
it. Hume Steel, Ltd., another subsidiary,
which has substantial contracts in S. Aus.
and Vic., netted £7OOO for the 12 months to
Sept. 30, 1926. Its chief difficulty in the
way of further extension has been a lack of
working capital. The parent’s holding, on.
which no divs. have been paid to date, is
165.000 fully-paid £1 orris. These are
included with “shares in other cos.” at £416
—the actual cost.
• ••••»
All things considered the outlook for
Hume Pipe is better than it was a year
ago. and the market for the scrip has re-
mained steady at 16s. 3d. or thereabouts.
The investor at that figure gets a return of
9.7 p.c. as long as the 8 p.c. div. continues.
The net tangible security is 17s. lid., of
which Bs. is represented by plant whose
value depends largely on goodwill.

Profits follow the prices for lead and zinc;
hence the climb to the fat figures of 1925,
the easier tendency in 1920 and the sharp
contraction of 30.6 p.c. in last year’s net
earnings. This comparison of average metal
prices makes clear what has happened:—
Lead, per ton.

And the position has not improved since the
accounts closed; latest quotes were lead
£2l 2s. 6d. and zinc £26 10s. per ton. In
February there was a cut of Gd. in the
quarterly distribution, making 2s. per share
(£80,000) ; and another 6d. has been clipped
off in the dividend announced since the
accounts closed. Even with the reductions,
the dividends called for £4793 more than the
net earnings. The accounts claim a profit
of only £320,818, but the figure in the table
includes net additions to reserves, which
have moved in this way over the last three
years:—

Whether the financial flywheel actually
measures up to those dimensions depends
upon adequate provision having been made
for all contingencies.
Net assets, apart from the mine and plant,
have a book value equal to 295. Od. per
share. Here are the figures:—
1923. 1926. 1927.
Assets other than
mine and plant. £1,091,197 £1,419,303 £1,360,238
Liabilities . . 200,405 249,369 178,923
Excess assets . . £890,792 £1,169,934 £1,181,315
On the important matter of mine wastage
it is worthy of note that estimated ore re-
serves (4.250,000 tons) are actually 750,000
tons greater than they were five years ago,
and in the meantime 1,303,029 tons have
been raised. Also bodies are known to exist
which are not included in the estimates.
Nevertheless, the mine is undoubtedly poorer
by the amount of ore taken out; at last
year’s rate of extraction there is about
I. years’ work measured up. But the area
of profitable operations depends, of course,
upon the metal markets and working costs.
Five years ago 53.3 p.c. of the working
profits came from the treatment of old

There is still a bit to come from old slimes.
The co.’s metallurgists are wrestling with
the problem of profitably treating 119,000
tons of oxidised crusts containing approxi-
mately 13.900 tons lead and 19.800 tons
zinc. As the end of the slime dumps came
into view general-manager Wainwright de-
voted himself to the problem of quickening
the production of crudes, which has grown
from 203,659 tons in 1923 to 311,673 tons
last year. At what cost per ton these figures
show: —

The lead bonus to employees ceased in
December, the metal having got below the
£3O mark. Also the bigger tonnage handled
and movements in the cost of living helped
the average down. Still, the co. is in one
of the high-cost industries; miners on
development and stoping averaged 355. 4d.
per seven-hour shift last year compared
with 255. lOd. in 1923, and that means large
production and high metal prices if big
returns are to be won. Also the N. S.
Wales Child Endowment Act will add
£12,000 to this year’s wages bill —or would
if the present law remained unaltered.

The most important item there is metal
stocks, in at £205,439 compared with
£323,848 in the previous year. Lead was
taken in at £22 per ton and zinc at the
Board of Trade contract rate. As the price
of lead is now much below that figure, the
current term’s profits will be fortunate if
they escape damage from loss en stocks. It
depends on whether the stocks were all
realised before the £22 mark was touched
early last month. Interests in other cos..

During the year a £21,250 holding was
taken in British Metal Corp., which markets
most of the Empire’s non-ferrous metals,
including the lead production, of Broken Hill,
and pays 8 p.c. The lot and some sundry
income brought in £82,750 . last year.
Since the books were ruled off improved
recoveries have followed alterations in the
treatment plant. But what is of most
interest at the moment is whether metal
prices are likely to recover. Certainly there
appears to be no prospect of immediate
return to the high figures of a couple of
years ago, which were largely due to the
rehabilitation of Europe and the boom in
the motor trade. The world’s chief lead
consumers are storage-battery manufacturers
and the cables and paint and building indus-
tries. Partly because of the slackening in
the American-car business and in the build-
ing trades there and in England, where
arrears of construction are said to have
been overtaken, demand slackened and the
price of the metal fell. However, produc-
tion in some countries has already eased
and the American zinc output has been re-
duced. That and anticipations of a stronger
demand from Germany are expected to
steady lead and zinc prices, but it has yet
to be seen what recovery will be made.
The scrip recently changed hands at 395.

At the lower price it will take 6J years for
the investor to get his money hack on the
basis of the last quarterly distribution (Is.

The 970 ft. level was the chief contribu-
tor last year to the Broken Hill South’s
output of 311,673 tons; and it ought to be
a comfort to shareholders to know that the
deepest level (1370 ft.) gave an ore a little
richer in lead, zinc and silver than either
the 970 ft. level or the average for the whole
mine:—

With nearly a couple of thousand men idle
at Broken Hill because metals have slumped
and costs haven’t (the South's ore-truckers
last half-year averaged 31s. lOd. for a seven-
hour shift), all the old water-schemes that
the field has ever heard of have been resur-
rected. Thirty-odd years ago Harry Stock-
dale tried to get a Darling River scheme
through ; but tbe size of it and the fact that
the water would have to be lifted about
700 ft. killed it. Richard English, an engi-
neer, found a gorge which he wanted to
dam; but the money wasn’t forthcoming,
though the scheme had its merits. Since then,
in addition to the original Stephens Creek
scheme, the Umberuinberka has been
dammed; and both these works belong to
the State. It would have been best at the
beginning to have gone to the Darling; but
with the two other schemes completed and in
the hands of the State, there is no justifica-
tion for the heavy expenditure when at least
four of the Broken Hill mines are about fin-
ished. There is, however, justification for
spending a bit of money in re-conditioning
the Stephens Creek reservoir, pipe-track and
plant.

The cabled suggestion of London control-
lers of Westralian goldmines that the State
Government should assist to revive the min-
ing industry by giving either a cash sub-
sidy or a bonus on gold produced is being
ignored. Premier Collier says, in effect, that
the State will only help those who help
themselves. T T,i til the aforesaid controllers
make a move in this direction Collier in-
tends to hang on to the £165,000 plus inter-
est which his Government earmarked some
time ago for assistance to mining. Mean-
while tbe gold yield steadily shrinks and the
condition of the industry is pitiful. At Kal-
goorlie, where nearly the whole of the
State’s yield is and has been obtained for
years past, a rise of Is. 6d. per ton in the
price of firewood threatens to further limit
production, Mineowners declare that they
cannot pay the increased amount and the
firewood supply co. says that in view of the
new arbitration award covering firewood
getters it can’t accept less.

Adelaide and Kalgoorlie capital has been
found for the working of about 1000 acres
of alluvial tin at Moolyella, near Port Hed-
land (W.A.). Several plants designed to
recover the metal without the aid of water
are to be installed and the first is expected
to be working before Christmas.
Adelaide owns most of the shares in the
Moolyella Main Leads Tin Mining and
Development Syndicate, which holds four
claims, each 300 acres. The hope of this
co. centres in the Perkins-Wesley separation
plant. The pilot machine, which is being
built in Adelaide, is just about ready.

Backed by a highly favorable report from
State Mining-Engineer Montgomery the
Westralian Government has decided to intro-
duce a bill to provide Wiluna with a rail-
way. Montgomery states that the big co.’s
shows have now been well proved, and when
the 200 ft. and 290 ft. levels have been ex-
tended the full length of the known ore-
bearing area not less than a million tons of
ore will be available above those points. He
sees no reason why the property should not
have a life of at least 25 years, and maintain
an output of 300,000 tons annually above
the 800 ft. level for at least 10 years. As
regards treatment, he declares that there is
no occasion to fear any unusual metallurgi-
cal difficulty in getting an entirely satisfac-
tory extraction of gold.

Something is likely to be heard of Aber-
foyle tin, Tas. No. 1 shaft struck lode at
26ft. showing 4ft. wide, and the central shaft
at 18ft. cut lode 3ft. wide. A straight
shaft on hanging wall and a third prospecting
shaft and a shallow tunnel have proved
an ore channel 60ft. wide showing many
lodes bulking from 3 to 12 p.c. oxide.
Storey’s Creek, three miles away, is proved
to 300 ft. and averages 3 p.c. tin. The co.
should be producing in six months. On the
evidence of such managerial reports as these
it looks like making a great property : “Third
prospecting shaft lode 4ft. wide, Avash from
loz. to 18oz. to the dish. Estimate for-
mation worth about 12 per cent.” _ The co.
is in 1000 shares of £25 each and is stabled
by John Brandon, of Melbourne.

Guinea Gold, one of the earliest of the
New Guinea gold-getting propositions, reports
that mutilation of a radio message caused
an error in the yardage figures of the Guinea
Gold South, as. estimated by Jack Coldham,
the co.’s engineer. These should read
5,000,000 cubic yards, and not 410,000 c.y.,
with a value of 2s. 4d. per yard. The leases
are a dredging proposition, whereas Jim co.’s
original areas at Koranga and Kaili are
sluicing shows. Now that the native labor
has been brought back from the testing work
on the dredging areas, gold production is
being resumed at the Koranga lease. As
soon as the water-race is ready on the
Kaili show —which should be in about three
months’ time —production will begin there.
As regards the Guinea Gold South leases,
Coldliam’s report shows 500,000 c.y. valued
at ss. per yard, 5.000,000 c.y. valued at
2s. 4d„ and 2,000,000 c.y. not yet tested.
These figures are “understood” to apply only
to the original pegging of 400 acres, and not
to the 450 acres since pegged along the out-
side boundaries of the original ground,
though there seems no reason why that ques-
tion couldn’t have been settled before issuing
the report. “Understood” is a word that has
no place in a mining report. The co. also
holds two leases on Merri Creek, one of 43
acres and one of 20 acres. On this run a
rich reef is said to have been found.

Captain de Hautpick, a Russian map-

Additional Malayan tin dredging returns
for September include Larut’s 75 tons from
350,000 yards turned over by the four
dredges of the consolidated cos. Much the
same turnover yielded 95 tons in August, so
averages have dropped. Costs, as usual, are
low, standing at 4.51 d. Tongkah Compound
No. 2, which is an offshoot of the better-
known Tongkah Compound, showed a sharp
increase on its August figures by recovering
31 tons of tin oxide from 68,000 yards, the
earlier figures being 16.5 tons from 71,000
c.y. The September recovery, averaging, as
it does, slightly over a pound per yard, is a
good deal better than the concern has been
doing for some months past. The original
estimated value of the whole area held was
.601 b. per cubic yard, though much of it
was expected to go lib. Latest figures indi-
cate that the dredge has reached the rich
section. The question of another and more
efficient dredge has been considered for some
time.
* * * *
Tin Bentong is another Melbourne flo-
tation, started as long ago as 1914, but
poor results were obtained from the first area
worked, and the dredge was shifted to the
present holding in 1924. There the story has
been one of continued success, and though
much of the shallow ground has now been
worked out—-the average for the 394-acre
area is only 164 ft. —it is estimated that
about 8,000,000 c.y. of dirt remains to be
treated; and save for a patch of 72 acres
valued about .791 b per yard, the average
should be about lib. The September yield of
tin was 36.65 tons from 106,500 yards, which,
roughly, measured up to the 1926 July-to-
December return of an average of .801 b. to
the cubic yard. In August the co. recov-
ered 22.7 tons from 61,300 yards, and in
July 34.1 tons from slightly more.
* * *
Takuapa, one of the Malaya Tin’s bant-
lings, is another of the Siamese concerns
showing better figures. For September 50
tons were won from 140,000 yards, which
reads better than August’s 37 tons from
135,000 yards. Takuapa’s estimated average
per yard for the period from May to Decem-
ber, 1926, was .731 b., and for the previous
term .771 b., and these values are being well
maintained. But working costs are not pub-
lished, nor are realisation figures.

Commonwealth Malaya proposes a recon-
struction to provide funds for further pros-
pecting and especially to conclude the check
boring of an area which E. J, Rodda esti-
mates to be worth over .71b. The £5O shares

cient of the reserved lot will be offered to do
the job.

Jelpang, a tin-dredging show close to Ipoh,
in the F.M.S., has reported that the dredge
began working on October 1, on two shifts,
which are to be increased to three in a few
days, if all goes well. The co. was promoted
at the end of 1925 by Tanah Biji, a pros-
pecting concern in which the Pratten-New-
man-Penman group are interested, and the
start to dig within the two years was a good
performance. Capital is £120,000 in f.p. £1
shares ; 65,000 are contribs. paid up to 205.,
and 55,000 were issued as f.p., while Tanah
Biji’s whack was 30,000 f.p. shares. A. P.
Penman’s estimate was that the 400 acres
included 330 acres containing 20,000,000
cubic yards, average depth 38ft. One section
of 9,000,000 c.y. was estimated to go lib. to
the yard, and the second section of
11,000,000 c.y. .701 b. In spite of a limestone
bottom, no dredging troubles were antici-
pated. The Werf Conrad dredge of 130,000
c.y. per month capacity is designed to dig
65ft. below water level. All going well, the
first fortnight’s returns for October should
give shareholders an idea of how close the
plant will get to the estimated output of
60 tons per month, and to the yearly profit
of £BO,OOO with tin at £250 (London).
Sellers have been asking 395. for the shares
in Sydney.
* 'jf * *
Rawang last month turned over 170,000
yards for 62 tons, the bucket dredge con-
tributing 32 of it and the sluicing plant
30. September’s figures are 38 and 40 tons
respectively; total 78 tons from 191,000
yards, with working costs sd. This is the
best for some time, and the periodical shift-
ing of the sluicing plant hasn’t helped either.
Malim Nawar got on to richer ground last
month and turned over 118,000 yards for
28 tons compared with 123,000 yards for 26
tons in August. For the past few months
this co.’s results have shown steady improve-
ment, and Malcolm Newman’s original esti-
mate of .821 b. of field concentrates may be
realised. Malim Nawar South dropped nine
days for dredge repairs, but cleaned up 30
tons from 120,000 yards. This represents
about three-fifths of the pound-a-yard values
forecasted for the greater portion—3s mil-
lion yards—of the area. The remaining 15
million is put down at .751 b. ground. Kuala
Kampar had a good spin, with 40 tons
turned in from 172,000 yards—a big jump
from the August 14 tons from 94,000 yards.
This is a deep-ground proposition, and its
big modern dredge, designed to go down to
90 feet, has already shown itself capable of
handling much more than the 150,000 yards
a month which was the minimum expected
of it. It is noteworthy that production
costs, 3d. a yard in this case, were the
lowest of the Pratten-Newman group. Kun-
dang, yet another of Alluvial’s subsidiaries,
managed to achieve its modest objective of
30 tons per month in August and repeated
the performance last month. The directors
are well satisfied with , the outlook, and so
they should be while tin remains around its
present figure. Though it has taken the
plant some time to work up to the required
minimum, there is no reason in sight why
the average should not be maintained. Re-
coveries are well up to boring estimates of
751 b. Takuapa has been showing in-and-out
form. The September return is 50 tons
from 140,000 yards compared witli only 47
tons from 135,000 yards in August—in
July the return was 57 tons. On the whole,
the show has lived well up to its promise,
though such necessary incidents as shifting
the dredge into the river and back again have
wasted much time. The co. will have a
second modern dredge at work by the end
of this year, and this should help costs as
well as double the output.

Satupolo Tin, a Melbourne flotation in
Western Siam —an offshoot of Pulo Tin and
the first subsidiary of the latter —first saw
the light in March, 1926, and hopes to have
the dredge under steam by December, the
superstructure being now completed. The
original estimate was that the plant (130,000
c.y. capaicityl) would be delivered under
steam by July 27. Boring estimates were
high. A. J. Phillips, who bored the selected
area of 350 acres, and H. H. Miller, who
checked him, agreeing on a value of 16oz. per
c.y. and an average depth of 251 ft. A
monthly net profit of £5400 is expected, or
£64 ; 000 p.a. Issued capital is 48,500 f.p.
ordinaries, 90,000. contribs. paid to 145., and
10,500 10 per cent. cum. participating pref.
shares fully paid up. Pulo took 30,000 f.p.
shares, and £i7,500 cash and 17,500 f.p.
shares were handed to the original vendor,
Tim Hock Seng, of Takuapa.

There will be a multitude of new men in
the 28th N.S.W. Parliament, besides
R. W. D. Weaver (Neutral Bay) and H.
Goldstein (Coogee), who are political old-
hands but were out of the last Parliament.
Tressider, of Randwick, a business man, is
a cobber of Goldstein, with whom he has

in Oatley.
shared the mayoralty of Randwick, in alter-
nate long terms, for a decade and a half.
B. S. Stevens (Croydon), who was Director
of Finance for the Fuller Govt., is likely
to be a useful man. C. F. S. Glasgow
(Waverley) is a lawyer; L. 0. Martin
(Oxley) is a business man of Taree, where
he has been an alderman for 20 years; Bryce
Walmsley (Lane Cove) is an accountant,
and E. S. Marks (North Sydney) has been
an unshakable alderman of the City Council
for years. H. C. Carter, who won Liverpool
Plains for the C.P., is a wealthy stock-
breeder with a scientific turn, who writes
knowledgeably on land topics under the
name of “Nardoo.” B. C. Olde (Leichhardt)
is a Laborite who has been trying for years.
Hamilton Knight (Hartley), who takes .Tim
Dooley’s place, is president of the Western
Miners. Mick O’Sullivan, who beat Fred
Davison, of the R.S.L., in Woollahra, is
Mayor of Paddington and a man of many
sporting associations. T. J. Shannon (Surry
Hills'* represents Cook in the City Council.
H. J. McDicken (Ryde) tried to beat Prat-
ten at the last Federal election; and J.
Lamaro (Enmore) is the Laborite-bar-
rister who tackled W. M. Hughes on the
same occasion. Dan Clyne (King), who is
an organiser of the Storemen’s Union, was one
of the leaders of the industrial section; and
R. J. Cameron (Wallsend), the Labor official
choice who has beaten Protestant Laborite
Skelton, is a coalminer.
After killing a six-foot black snake on his
Benalla sheep-farm on a recent Sunday.
Jones, Minister for Public Works,
wondered whether the critics would con-
demn him as a Sabbath-breaker. Earlier
in the day he had driven to AA'arrenbayne to
have a look at a road about which a com-
plaint had been made. But no one would
break the Day of Rest to state the case for
the downtrodden highway. Beckett, Minister
for Health, is as bad ; he travelled on Sunday
to look at a consumptive hospital on Mon-
day morning. The Trades Hall Reds must
groan in spirit at this unseemly enthusiasm
for work.
George PI. Blakeslee, on loan from Clark
University, U.S.A., has a long tail of letters
to his name, lie comes to Sydney Uni. for
a short time as the representative of the
Carnegie Endowment of International Peace.
He made a favorable impression at the Colo-
nial Institute lunch in his honor. To a mild
expression and a benign smile he added a
speech that was only slightly weighted by
statistics but heavily garnished with the
usual messages of goodwill.
N.S.W. schoolteachers lost the Moses who
led them into the land of unionism when
Ebenczer Dash died the other day. Besides
being for four years president of the
Teachers’ Federation, he held a similar
office in the State Services Confederation
and the Headmasters’ Federation, and was
the teachers’ rep. on the Appointments
Board of the Education Department. He
was a member of the Lawson Memorial
Committee, and Australian literature had in
him a sterling friend and active supporter.
Doubt about the fate of Frank Basil Riley,
son of Perth’s C. of E. archbishop, seems to
have been settled. A cable states that he
was murdered, probably when he wanted to
see details of the fighting—he was London
Times correspondent. Riley, who was
AV.A.’s Rhodes Scholar for 1912, was in
England when the Big Scrap started and
immediately took a commission with the
AViltshires. In October, 1914, he was taken
prisoner, but he made his escape, from Ger-
many early in 1918 and was interned in
Holland for the rest of the war.
Charles Mylene McDonald, the new presi-
dent of the N.S.AV. Employers’ Federation,
has been handling industrial troubles and
difficulties all his life. He was a youngster
of 22 when he was given the job of secretary
to the Australasian Steamship Owners’
Federation, formed in 1904 to deal with the
employers’ difficulties under the newly-intro-
duced Arbitration Act. It was not foreseen
that arbitration would develop as it did, or
the position might have gone to an older
man. But McDonald justified himself so
well that the North Coast S. N. Co. was
glad to get him as a manager nine years
later. Howard Smiths lifted him from that
position to be their inspector. But the
Northern Collieries’ Association decided that
a man who knew so much about industrial
disputes was needed as its secretary. He
was appointed chairman four years ago.
J. G. S. Purvis, Sydney AVater and Sewer-
age Board’s chief engineer, is dead at 64.
A Durham man, he came to Sydney
at 26 and made rapid progress in
his calling; in eight years he rose from
the position of draughtsman in the AVorks
Department to the job of chief draughtsman
with the AVater Board. He got his last
appointment seven years ago, and during his
term was responsible for the expenditure of
£30,000,000 in making Sydney ready for its
next million.
Presbyterians in the Ma State are in
mourning for AVilliam AYood, who for many
years looked after their Sunday saxpences.
Almost directly after his arrival from Scot-
land, 43 years ago, he became their accountant,
and for over 17 years he was secretary of
St. Andrew’s College and treasurer of the
Burnside Homes. Outside the church his
activities had a bookish flavor: he was a
trustee of the Public Library for 27 years—
chairman for the last three —and, until he
resigned in 1926, he was chairman of the
Mitchell Library Trustees.
The job of chairman of the Tariff Board
was a jubilee birthday present to Deputy-
Comptroller of Customs McConagliy. Born
at Bin along on August 11, 1877, McCon-
agliy’s first pay envelope came from the N.S.W.
Postal Department; but in '97 he passed to
the Customs, and 10 years later he assisted
H. McCONAGHY, the new Chairman of
the Tariff Board.
in framing the Lyne tariff. During the war
he administered the War Precautions Regu-
lations relating to companies. In between
times he has been Collector of Customs in
W.A. and in Victoria.
Few participants in the Lambing Flat
riots (N.S.W.) are left to tell a first-
hand tale, and their number was further
reduced when Reuben Harris died at Bogan
Gate. The old man had ticked off a full
97 years, 73 of them in N.S.W. He came
from Cornwall. He was in the rushes at
Braidwood and Lambing Flat. Later, after
fossicking about Forbes and Parkes, he
decided that a teamster’s job paid better
dividends.
Mon ash is patron-president of the Federa-
tion of Australian Zionist Societies, which
was formed by representatives of the Chosen
who met in Melbourne just before the Jewish
New Year. M. Zeltner, a Melbourne Jew,
a notable giver to Jewish causes, is offi-
cial president. The Federation marks the
growth of Zionist feeling amongst Australian
Jews, although less than 10 years ago there
was little Australian interest in the scheme
to restore Palestine. The now dead A. T.
Chodowski founded the Australian Jewish
Chronicle as a strong partisan of the
movement, which has since made remarkable
headway.
Sam Barnes, Minister for Railways in the
Lawson Government (Vic.) in 1918-23, was
given a cheque and an illuminated address
by political and personal friends in Melb. the
other day. He was defeated for Walhalla
at last State election. Barnes, who is now
engaged in citrus-growing, declared that his
first crop consisted of two oranges which
had cost him £5OO each, but from politics he
had reaped a harvest of friendship which
would help to sweeten the years to be. Sam,
like most confirmed bachelors, is a most
companionable fellow. He was mine manager
of the Long Tunnel, Walhalla, when it was
a mint.
Paddy Hassett, who trained thousands of
young people for business careers at his P’ran
school (Vic.), marked his last paper the
other day. For five years he opened his
establishment free to Diggers to equip them
for commercial jobs. There was real re-
gret at his demise in many a home and office,
lie was better than a father to some of his
girl trainees, for he was game to show firm-
ness that was absent in their homes, and
they blessed him as they got more ballast.
Asst.-R.M. Ivarius and patrol-officer Ivan
Champion, who succeeded in reaching the
head of the Strickland and Fly rivers early
this year, have set out on another attempt to
cross the Victor Emanuel Ranges into the
Mandated Territory. On this occasion 12
trained native policemen and fourscore
D’Entrecasteaux and Daru carriers will
accompany tlie expedition. Karius slipped
easily into the life of an assistant magistrate
in Papua; formerly he was a mine assayer
under Walter Colley, well known through
the Territory and N.Q.
The recent death of Charles Kendall, who
had spent most of a long life in Bathurst,
recalls memories of his cousin poet Henry
Kendall and of their grandfather mission-
ary Thomas Kendall. After being first resi-
dent-magistrate in Maoriland, Thomas Ken-
dall settled on a property among the green
hills of Ulladulla (N.S.W.), given to him as
a grant from Governor Darling. And there his
most famous descendant, Henry, was born in
1841.
There are no fewer than seven ex-Speakers
out of politics in N.S.W. —Henry Willis,
Harry Morton, R. D. Meagher. Judge Cohen,
Simon Hickey, J. H. Cann and James
Dooley.
Spryer and more fortunate than Mackrell,
who had practically the same measure in
hand for the Allancocks, Jack Cain, one of
Hogan’s honoraries, steered the Forestry
Bill through the Vie. Assembly. It
strengthens the law against people who
start bush-fires, whether wantonly, care-
lessly or to get a good “burn” on their own
holdings. Now it will be Beckett’s turn to
bullock the bill through the House of Land-
lords. Hogan is giving his four honoraries
a fair share of the limelight, in addition to
an allowance of £2OO a year each.
No one at the Randwick Spring meeting
could claim a longer direct family connection
with racing than secretary Icely, of the
llawlcesbury club. One hundred years ago
his grandfather bought the horse Steeltrap
for £250; it was imported four years before
by Aspinall. Incidentally, Don Panther,
winner of the Hawkesbury Spring Handicap,
is one of Steeltrap’s descendants.
Rodney Boyce, who has recently retired
on pension from the job of Surveyor-General
of the Soudan, is one of the many Australians
who have made good in other lands. His
father was a police-magistrate in Queensland
for many years. Beginning as a bank-clerk,
Rodney later found his way into the survey
department of the Lands. While there he
was chosen as one of a batch of surveyors
for whose services Sir William Macgregor,
who was then Governor of Lagos and had
had experience of the Queenslanders in
British New Guinea, specially asked. After
four years in West Africa, young Boyce was
invited to join the Soudan survey staff, and
his first job was the planning of the new
city of Omdurman. From then on he rose
in the service, till, in 1924, he was appointed
Surveyor-General. And now, after 25 years,
he returns to a quiet life on his native
plains.
James R. McGregor, who collapsed in the
Clerk’s chair within a few minutes of the
opening of Parliament at Canberra, was
curiously like his old chief, Walter G'de.
Both had graduated in the school of State
politics—a school established in the days
when courtesy was still a factor in the con-
duct of public affairs, and when the tra-
ditions of the House of Commons were
honored in the observance. Though in
appearance and manner belonging more to
The late J. R. McGREGOR, Clerk of the
House of Reps.
the cloister than the club, both were sociable
fellows, and none regret them more than
their cronies of the Melbourne Yorick. Mc-
Gregor was strongly affected by Gale’s death,
and was overcome by emotion as members
testified to the worth of the old chief. His
grave, in St. John’s churchyard, Canberra,
is under an old pine facing Parliament
House, and Walter Gale sleeps next to him.
He gave the sitting for the sketch on this
page the day before his death.
SO LONG!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You’ve had a wild and whirling time —such
super-hectic reign
No Premier ever knew before nor ever may
again.
No bull inside a china-sliop could ever horn
and prong
As devastatingly as you. And now, wild
man, so long!
The weary river winds to sea; the turbid
ones progress
Towards the final emptying-out in half the
time or less.
You foamed and bubbled o’er the rocks in
torrent fierce and strong,
Leaving destruction in your wake and wreck-
age wild. So long!
You stormed and bellowed, tore and broke,
and sought rough-shod to ride
O’er ev’rything that blocked your path or
checked you in your stride.
You sowed the storm and now you feel the
whirlwind’s stinging thong
About you laid. Who set you up have hurled
you down. So long !
Where’er you went you bounced and banned,
you threatened and you fumed ;
Around you strife and discord raged and bit-
terness consumed.
Your creed was simple: You were right and
ev’rybody wrong
Who dared to disagree with you. Sir Oracle,
so long!
You cared not whom you sacrificed, so you
might gain your ends;
The direst foes you made of those who once
were staunchest friends.
You set them at each other’s throats, a
faction-sundfcred throng
The following that once you led. So long,
wild man, so long!
N.S.W.

operating for oearlsliell in Torres Strait is
in the habit, when down, of undoing his
life-line and fastening it to a rock on the

ocean bottom. He only risks this in slack
water, the object being to keep the lugger
hovering over the one spot; otherwise, the
“drift ’ of the vessel would possibly compel
him to temporarily vacate a patch of good
ground he might not be able to locate and
work again. This diver walks about the
floor of the ocean until his bag is filled
with shell, then returns to the life-line,
hitches it round his body, signals, and is
brought to the surface. While anchored
to the rock, should any accident of the sea
cause the line to part, or should a shark,
groper or diamond-fish tackle the intruder,
lie is connected to the world above only by
liis india-rubber air tube. He has nothing
by which he can signal his predicament,
or call for help. But, nevertheless, he can
always rise providing the air-pipe does not
become severed or entangled. He shuts
tight the air-escape valve, and the dress
almost instantly becomes inflated. Faster
and faster he shoots to the surface and
lies there, perhaps many yards away from
the vessel, a helpless monster. If a shark
is after him, he stands a poor chance of
escape, as the air-pipe would probably give
way were the tender to try to haul him
aboard.
* * * *
“Bill O’C.”: The significance of “the
Never-Never” (B. 15/9/’27), applied mostly
to the waterless or inaccessible country
“back of beyond,” is fairly obvious, and it
may as easily be a white man’s pleasantry
or a black one’s adoption of a frequently-
heard adverb. Men of every color are quick
to fasten on any word always recurring in
talk. Witness “nalipoo” and other coinages
of the Diggers. Listen to early-settler A ex-
amining earlier-ditto B. “Ever been in that
country out there?” “Never.” “Ever think
of taking it up?” “Never.” “Would stock
do any good there?” “Never.” Or it may
be an explorer or prospector comes along.
“Find any gold there?” “Never a color.”
“Find any surface water?” “Never.” “Think
of going back?” “Never on your life.” An
abo. is inquired for. “What’s come of Tar-
pot?” “Oh, him go that way, long way.”
“When him come back?” “Never.” And pro-
bably Billy emphasises it into “Nebber-
nebber.” Remember, too, that the vague
country beyond usually needs a handy name,
and young Billjim and Black Billy, as atten-
tive listeners, would soon attend to that.
* * * *
“Pick”: In the Gourock Ranges, east of
Lake George (N.S.W.), there roamed for
years a lone angora that had been lost from
Werriwa station. He grew into a magnifi-
cent animal, with spreading horns and a
pure-white fleece of curling mohair—and a
smell that could be carved with a tomahawk.
When disturbed by a hunter, he would,
while keeping out of gun-range, bleatingly
follow him for miles. The speediest of
creatures when chased, he eluded his pur-
suers by bounding over thickets and tearing
through jungles; then, when the hunt had
been abandoned, he would come trotting
confidingly in the rear. Eventually he did
himself in by getting in the way of a train
whilst seeking feed on the line.
“Trampas”: Though it may be surprising
that relatively few Australians can tell you
correctly whether the two varieties of big
saurian found in this country are alligators
or crocodiles, the map offers plenty ot'
excuse for the confusion. Two streams
entering Cleveland Bay (N.Q.) are named

respectively Alligator River and Crocodile
River. In the N.T. are Crocodile Island,
the Crocodile Islands, South Alligator
River and East Alligator River. And many
lesser wetnesses —pools, creeks, swamps,
lagoons—are called after ’gators and crocs.
The “New Guinea” croc, referred to by
“Anaf” (B. 22/9/’27) is found all along
North Australia’s sea coast, and in the
East Indies, the Malay Peninsula, Burma,
Siam and Cochin-China as well. He is often
a traveller, and can sometimes be seen at
sea. Twenty-live feet of him is no phenome-
non, but, as “Anaf” says, the native Aus-
tralian croc, rarely exceeds eight feet. More-
over, the local lad prefers fresh water to
salt, very probably having been driven to
higher and shallower levels aeons ago by
the heftier and more savage invader.

“Sue Shannon.”: “’Ere we are —back
again,” said Myrtle, as I helped her pick
hops in an old garden beside the sparkling
Derwent. “Pickin’ for a dead ’orse this
trip. We’re always pickin’ for somethin’.
Las’ year it was a cow dad bought, an’ it
died on ’im. This time it’s ole Dobbin.
Dad’s always buyin’ ’orses at sales, an’ they
mostly die on us. This time ’e picked up
an ole ’orse he says was quiet an’ cheap an’
put ’im in the plough to turn up a bit of
faller. At the end of the furrer ’e renigged
—’e’d only go one way. So dad an’ the boys
’ad to lump the plough back to the top end
agin, an’ orf ’e’d go with dad orfsiderin’ ’im
with curses. One sweltring’ ’ot day dad
yelled, ‘Bring the axe, wumman.’ The axe
was for Dobbin. That night dad ‘We’re
all goin’ over to the Derwent valley ’op-
pickin’ nex’ week.’ So ’ere we are—work-
in’ orf Dobbin.”
* * . * *
“Tongio West”: Some birds build their
nests close to what one would regard as
their bitterest foes. On two occasions I have
found the nests of little tits almost touching
hawks’ nests. And recently I spotted a grass-
wren’s nest within a foot of the entrance to
a fox’s burrow, and only a foot above the
ground. Several foxes used this burrow,
and in entering or leaving it must have
brushed against the nest, which contained a
brood of young birds. Yet these fledglings
and their parents were as safe from harm
as if the foxes had been miles away.

“Jesmond” : The belief in the harmlessness
of koalas (B. 25/8/’27) is one that needs
exploding. In lightly timbered districts a
few bears may cause havoc among the trees.
Their destructiveness is slow but none the
less sure. A couple of bears will take
possession of a tree and not leave it until
it is bare of leaves; a repetition of this
ravage and the tree will die as surely as if
it had been rung. It is an exceptional case,
no doubt, but it has happened on Phillip
Island (Vic.). A thousand and one pests
and “blasts” are blamed for the decline of
Phillip Island gum-trees, but often the bears
have so weakened them that they fall easy
victims to the other pests. It is small satis-
faction to be told that the trees are of no
commercial value, since being the only ones
the district possesses they are worth keep-
ing. I have no wish to see the bears
exterminated, but it is time they were re-
garded in their true colors.
* • ■ * '
“Jeanong” : No one seems to have noticed
how destructive eagles are to native-bears,
On the Rivertree Ranges, New England
(N.S.W.), my father came upon a hear, full-
grown, fighting for life with an eagle, which
had torn out one of its eyes. The koala,
uttering almost human cries, ran up the
horse’s leg to my father’s arms for shelter,
The eagle pursued it, and was, with difficulty,
beaten off with the stockwhip handle.
* * * *
“,C.A.”: The hawk-moth (B. 15/9/’27)
may be the best grub for tempting Murray
cod, but the bogong-grub runs it close. This
grub measures up to four or five inches
in length and half an inch in diameter,
The angler will find it in the deep ravines
of any of the rivers in the Southern High-
lands; its haunt is indicated by sawdust-like
droppings at the base of trees. A sharp
tomahawk is the only appliance necessary,
and a good tree will always yield a few
dozen. They can be kept alive for a week
if not left in the sun.

“E.S.”: Binks was travelling with his wife
j n a tilted cart, and turned out one evening
alongside Squatter Woollenskin’s wire fence,
pje loosened the wires to put his horses in
the paddock, and was about to help himself
to a few yards of wire from the bottom
when lie saw Woollenskin riding towards him.
Rj n ks was an old hand on the track. He
picked up a forked stick, and was tighten-
ing the wires lie had loosened, when the
owner arrived. “What are you doing to that
fence?” asked the latter. “Mendin’ it,” said
Binks, calmly. “There was a couple of
wires down, an’ I didn’t want my nags to
po ke through in the night an’ get lost.” The
squatter nodded and rode away. After dark
Binks unfastened the wires again and put
ids horses through. Next day, after wasting
several hours looking for them, he found
them in the stockyard. Woollenskin was an
old hand on the track, too.

“J.F.C.” : My neighbor lias a prize rooster
au d a valuable Irish terrier. When the
bird crows the dog howls, regardless of the
hour, but lie is unaffected by the crowing
of the other birds. Beating the dog has
proved useless. If there is a member of the
household near him when the crowing corn-
mences he trembles all over, runs to his
kennel, and liowls there. Any suggestions
short of sudden death?

“Chinta”: Tlio description given by
“Saylor” (B. 22/9/’27) of the fisli at Towns-
ville seems to fit only one species—the barra-
cuda. He is a wicked-looking fellow of the
sea-pike ( Sphyra&na) family, and averages
about 7ft., although 1 have caught speci-
mens up to 1 Oft. He, and not the shark,
is the terror of the tropical lagoons. Malays

sharks will not enter the water if there be

Hi
“Cooramin”: Some N.S.W. country
towns seem to be having a competition in
apparitions. Temora has a weird brown
beast that is bigger than a dingo and gallops
like a draught-horse. Though it has been
seen by several “thoroughly reliable res.
dents,” the mystery is too elusive to be
cornered or shot. Tamworth has a ghostly-
white horse wandering about the environs ot
the township and opening gates m an
uncanny fashion. According to a local alder-
man, the supernatural quadruped has been
at large thereabouts for 12 years. lhe
poundkeeper reported that he had made
several efforts to catch the beast, but it had
always vanished as if it had dropped into a
hole and then pulled in the hole. Tinonee
also has a ghost—a bobbing light that
appears suddenly on the flat, and after
travelling rapidly up a near-by lull dis-
appears just as suddenly. It has been
investigated by residents and visitors, and
even shot at with rifles and shotguns; but
it still bobs along its customary course as
mysteriously as ever.

“Landa” : A kookaburra, carrying a piece
of pork stolen from the Grafton (N.S.W.)
bacon-factory, sat on the busbars of a 0.000
-volt transformer to “kill” the meal by
knocking it against the bars. A brother
johnnie sat on the opposite bar watching
the process, and at an opportune moment
made a grab at the dainty. There was a
flash of lightning when the fuse blew as the
result of the short circuit, and the linesman
going round to investigate found two charred
birds, with their beaks completely fused
together, and a slab of roast pork acting as a
flux.

“Toby C.”: Some rabbiters adopt the
“lean-to” method of marking their sets; that
is, they lean a stick against any tree or
stump near the set, then scratch a mark
pointing from tree to trap and from tree
to tree. Many old hands disdain marking,
particularly if they have a good trap-dog;
but the popular method is to make a short
line pointing from trap to trap, marking
from the second trap to the first, and so on.
The last set becomes the first on the take-
out run, and the point leads on from trap to
trap until the last is reached; the mark
then directs the trapper to his camp or to
the nearest track leading campwards. It
is not unusual for even an old hand to get
slewed at night, particularly if in strange
territory seen under lantern-light. Once
off his track, the trapper may flounder
about for an hour before he picks it up
again, and then the chances are he has
missed several traps, or is traversing ground
he has been over before.

“C. Coral”: The fire-tipped arrow, a
favorite method of warfare in various parts
of the colored world, was known to the
natives of Torres Strait. The point of the
arrow was. placed in the fire until it glowed,
then discharged into the thatched roofs of
the villagers, and after the smouldering
missile had lain in its grassy bed for a while
the flames would crackle. The device was
also favored by aggrieved islanders who
wanted to get home on other fellows. “That
thing he fine for fix up mother man when
you don’t want him see you,” remarked old
Charlie when lie was describing the method.
“You can do him from long way, and that
man inside house he sleep he don’t savee
nothing.”
NO CONVENIENCES.
DENTIST: “Spit out.”
PATIENT: “The window's shut.”
“liny Blase”: Has any Abo. seen that
small ’possum-like animal known as the
wyulda? As far as I know, only one speci-
men has been captured; its body reposes in
Perth Museum. There must be many more
in the Kimberley district, where this one was
snared, but so far I have not heard of any
being caught. The thing is about the same
size as our ’possum,, which it resembles.
Its tail, however, is hairless, except at the
butt, where it is also scaly.

“Bihai” : Papua boasts a vine which rivals
Jack's beanstalk in length and Jonah’s gourd
in rapidity of growth. It was discovered by
D’Alberti, the Italian explorer, while ascend-
ing the Fly River, and named D’Alberti’s
creeper. There are two species, the com-
moner one bearing near the. tip
of the vine bunches of brilliant
scarlet flowers in shape like a
parrot’s beak; the other is blue
in color. To trace the vine from
flower to roots through the lux-
uriance of the Papuan bush is
a complicated job, for it often
extends over 400 yards of dense
tropical growth. Seeds are
rarely found; they are greyish-
blue flat beans about inch in
diameter. I have set them in a
box and have noticed the grow-
ing points just peeping above
the earth at eight o’clock in the
morning; found the plant hang-
ing two feet over the edge by
noon and nearly two yards by
evening; and in a few days had
to hack away its growth to pre-
vent it smothering the verandah.
The scarlet blossom is a fairly
common si j?li t from Western to Central
Papua, but the only place I have seen the
blue was in the Inaukina district, some 50
miles inland behind Mekeo.

“Morob”: Once in a while the paradise-
bird of New Guinea migrates southward
across Torres Strait and down the Australian
eastern coast. A wanderer has been seen even
as far down as the Dorrigo scrub (N.S.W.).
The birds have often been sighted on Cape
York Peninsula, and only a few years back a
pair was seen near Cooktown. They are be-
coming scarce in the Dutch Territory, despite
the protective season proclaimed each year.
Nor has the total protection extended to
them in the Mandated Territory apparently
caused them to increase in that part.

“Dick the Diver” : “Wandi” (B. l/9/’27)
lias seen horses bury half their heads to get
at water-grass when the surface has been
eaten oil'. I’ve seen neddies duck all their
noddles under to get at it. A neighbor of
ours in South Queensland had a lagoon
which at times became almost choked with
water-growing weeds. When the paddocks
were bare cattle and horses would wade in
and blow themselves out on the juicy tucker,
the more venturesome prads wading out till
their feet almost lifted from the muddy
bottom. When the surface had been com-
pletely mowed down, the diving commenced.
Most of the- horses sank their heads to the
level of the eyes only; but the more knowing
ones ducked completely under, sending a
shower of muddy water from their forelocks
and manes as they bobbed up and shook
the water out of their ears. If a prad
happened to get out of his depth, as occa-
sionally one did, he’d simply swim over to
the other side of the lagoon.
* * * *
“T.V.T.”: The dove-grey (N.Q.) snake
that “Bis” is anxious to classify (B.
15/9/’27) is probably a brown wriggler that
has just shed its skin. The description of
its venom and lightning quickness tends to
strengthen this theory, in Northern Vic-
toria I have seen these reptiles discard the
old brown overcoat and emerge, looking
smart and dressy, in a shade of silver grey.

“The Rumpus”: The iodoform smell is
not confined to mushrooms and fungus (B.
8/9/’27). I have whiffed it in patches in
the Westralian coastal scrub and sand belts
after the first rains. In these places there
was no fungus to be seen, and i’ll take my
oath as to the absence of mushrooms, for
they were the edibles I was seeking. Hav-
ing spent over 12 months on my back
in two hospitals, I can guarantee the. “hum”
of iodoform when my proboscis runs into
it.
* * * He
“Kayeff”: I can assure “Larrapinta” (B.
8/9/’27) that octopus is not bad eating,
especially if the eater is unaware of the
material of the dish. Curiosity led me to
sample a small one that a Chink stoker was
grilling on a slice bar. Cooked this way,
it has a salty flavor, rather like smoked fish.
But it is best as Brown Brother prepares it:
cut small, beaten to a pulp and stewed
with grated cocoanut and sweet potatoes.
The flavor then is reminiscent of both
chicken and tripe.

“C.Q.”: I hadn’t much faith in the stories
about the indestructibility of cats, but I
have changed. I put three of them in a
stout chaffbag with tw r o bricks, and, securely
tieing up the neck, dropped them into a
deep and swiftly-flowing river. Next morn-
ing the trio were at the back door. I
repeated the performance, using three bricks
and a stouter bag. Next morning they were
back again. The veterans have been granted
a life-pension.
THE OPTIMIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met old Bill Frost on the corner last night,
A good sort of chap all the way;
And it took my mind back to a time when in
youth
We were free, open-handed and gay;
For the world was in front and we hadn’t a
care.
Then we suddenly parted one day
When the drama of life bade us fall into line
For the parts we were destined to play.
Now William has been all the years of his
life »
An optimist up to the hilt,
And from times adolescent he swore he’d not
rest
Till a fortune colossal he’d built.
He had schemes in galore like most million-
aires
To accumulate fabulous gilt,
But his luck was dead out, for the best of
his plans,
Like a collar in summer, would wilt.
There were years at a time when I never
saw Bill,
Though I’ve heard that his cupboard was
bare;
When we met I enquired in the usual way,
“How are things?” He would smile and
say “Fair,”
And assure me he had a big deal up his
sleeve
That would shortly dispel all his care;
\ r et at 40 ’twas clear as bright sunshine
to me
His castles were still in the air.
Bill is much older now, but assured me last
night.
Concealing his joy in a sob,
That at last he is in for a thumping big
haul.
Having thoroughly mastered the job.
He is certain the days that remain are all
right;
No more he will mix with the mob.. . .
As I wished him good-night in a whisper he
said,
“Say, old chap, can you slip me a hob?”
N.s.w.

THE DECREASED WHEAT YIELD.
“J.G.”: Every now and then someone
refers to the present-day Australian wheat
yield as being better than that of former
years, due to improved varieties of wheat.
While it is true that certain sorts of wheat,
such as Federation, are better yielders than
the older varieties, the average yield per
acre is lower than it was half a century
ago. To get a decent crop, it is necessary
to fallow a paddock after a crop is harvested.
Thus a piece of ground only produces a crop
every two years. And if this crop goes 30
bushels to the acre, it is considered an
excellent result. Half a century ago it was
nothing uncommon for a wheat crop to re-
turn from 40 to 50 bushels per acre, practi-
cally every year, from the same ground. In
those days all the crops had to be cut and
threshed. There was no leaving them stand-
ing until the grain was dead ripe, as then a
large percentage of wheat would be lost.
Crops cut a little on the green side are far
less exhausting to the soil than those left
until the grain ripens in the paddocks. It
is well known that any plant which is
allowed to ripen its seed on the stalk, without
the latter being cut, will take more fertility
out of the soil to ripen the seed than it
took to produce the green plant.
BREEDING BETTER HORSES.
“N.M.L.”: “Spike” (B. 25/8/’27) rails
at the quality of present-day horses on
stations and repeats the old parrot-cry of
our grandfathers: “Horses ain’t what they
used to be.” Of course, the answer is
that they never were. All the same, there’s
room for improvement in the horses of
to-day.
Brood mares might be selected more
intelligently than they are. On almost any
station where horse-breeding is part of the
game, this is what happens: Two mares
are broken in at the same time. One is a
good mare, a eut-and-come-again sort which
will carry a man there and bring him back
every time. The other is a waster, exactly
the sort of mare “Spike” refers to as being
of the present generation of uselessness.
What happens to those two mares? The
good ’un carries on and bears the dry salt
of sweat of many days. The waster, after
the blackboys have refused to ride her owing
to her uselessness, is put to the stud, per-
petuating her species in a paddock full of
rubbish. When the good mare is a worn-
out frame; when she’s passed through all
the stages of station work, from the head
stockman's : pride to the boundary-rider’s
drudge, and when she can’t lift one foot
before the other, she is put to the stud.
What chance has she of perpetuating her
good qualities? They’ve been dissolved in
sweat and melted in equine tears.
“Spike” refers only to horses of the
N.S.W. North Coast. What chance has a
horse of developing there? Hemmed in by
fences, subjugated to the* cow, a horse hasn’t
a chance at all. If “Spike” wants to
see horses that are horses let him go to the
hack-country of Queensland, away from the
fenced areas, out of sound of a telephone
bell and beyond the fumes of petrol.
A NEW WEED.
“Homo”: A new weed, and one that
threatens to become as great a pest as the
wild-lettuce and “take-all,” is the skeleton
plant. It is well known in the Riverina and
appears to be spreading northward. In
grazing land it does little damage, but
flourishes where the soil has been tilled.
Deep ploughing benefits it, and the roots will
live beneath the soil from one season to an-
other and be spread by the drill and harrow,
as the smallest piece of root seems to be cap-
able of starting a new plant. Wheat-
farmers should make themselves acquainted
with this weed so as to eradicate it early.
It is also called “naked weed” and sends up
slender stems with small flowers from a
spreading base of leaves. The plants shoot
up in early spring and cause great damage
to wheat' crops. Once a paddock is
thoroughly infested with them the best plan
is to make use of it for grazing only.
CENTRALISED SHEARING.
“Leo Lear” : The depdt shearing-shed advo-
cated by me to ensure the small sheepman
full prices for his wool is objected to by
“J.E.S.” (B. 15/9/’27) on four points:—
1. Distance some sheep must travel. Well,
this drawback is encountered by all large
stations, and does not prevent their big lines
of wool easily beating in price small lots of
equally good wool grown within coo-ee of
the tarboy.
2. Ticks may be spread from dirty to
clean sheep. Not much of an objection see-
ing that sheep are dipped—or should be —
within three weeks of shearing.
3. Expense. There is nothing to show
this would be greater. Anyhow, allow an
average cut of 61b. per sheep, and an in-
creased price of 2d. a lb. for a large lot
(both low figures), and where is the cocky
timid enough to jib at the cost?
4. Classihg can be done better in Sydney.
With this I entirely disagree. The shed is
the l’ight place to class wool. Among other
things it saves double handling, pressing,
etc.
SAFFRON THISTLE.
“Saaedi” ; I can’t agree with “Fred Rich”
when he says (B. 15/9/’27) that saffron
thistle is a valuable plant. When this
thistle grows in a thick mass stock will not
move amongst it, so sharp are its thorns.
Thus thousands of acres are lost to pastur-
age during any year in which the saffron
flourishes. Sheep will subsist on the seeds
and leaves if times are hard, but they
prefer almost anything else. Saffron thistle,
if let go, as “Fred Rich” apparently advo-
cates, tends to choke out everything else,
and though, of course, not as bad as prickly-
pear, invariably depreciates the value of the
land on w r hich it flourishes. Finally, if
“Fred Rich” had ever tried to strip a wheat
crop in which saffron thistle was growing
he wouldn’t have such an affection for this
pastoral pest.
CLASSING SMALL CLIPS.
“Latlr”: Referring to “R. E. Combing’s”
remarks (B. 8/9/’27), I have come to the
conclusion after a lifelong experience in the
trade that the careless classing so preva-
lent amongst small growers is due partly to
ignorance and partly to laziness. Very few-
of them take the trouble to come to the city
and see their wool sold, and have but the
haziest idea of wool-sale methods. When I
was travelling in the trade a cocky once
asked me if I was the man who spread the
fleeces at the sale, his idea being that the
buyers stood round the bales whilst they were
opened, and that fleeces were taken out and
unrolled for inspection as the sale was proceed-
ing. A fleece of wool is like a plum, inasmuch
as it has a “bloom,” and the more you handle
it tin- more you take the bloom off. It is a
well-known fact that a London buyer attend-
ing the Australian sales for the first time is
very liable to over-estimate his yields by two
or three per cent., on account of the wool
looking ~so much brighter and more attrac-
tive here than it does in the London sale-
rooms, due to the fact of its being dumped,
shipped and re-opened, with all the knocking
about it gets during such treatment. I agree
with “R. E. Combing” that the fleeces should
be classed as soon as they are shorn, and not
tumbled into the bales anyhow for classifi-
cation in the city.
“H.L.G.”: “R. E. Combing” cannot
understand (B. S/9/’27) why the _ aver-
age cocky does; not class his wool himself.
Well, the average cocky knows about as
much about the finer points of wool-classing
as he does about the differential calculus.
He is content, and glad, to pay his broker a
small sum (usually about id. per lb.) to have
the job done by a man wdto knows his busi-
ness. If the wool is w-ell skirted and carefully
liandled it comes out of the bale reasonably
well. Surely it is worth something for the
broker to be able to guarantee that the wool
has been classed by an expert. As for the
dust in the city, if it is any dustier than
some cockies’ sheds I have seen, I am sorry
for the people who live in the city. It is
not a perfect system by any means, but it
serves a purpose. The best solution is com-
munity sheds which would handle sufficient
sheep' to enable a good classer to be paid.
GETTING RID OF BURR.
“Geedla” : Every woolgrower suffers finan-
cially from noogoora and galvanised burr, but
the high cost of labor forces him to grin and
bear it. “It pays me to take a penny a
pound less for my clip,” says one big pas-
toralist, “and let Germany do the burr-extrac-
tion rather than try to cope with it.” But
when the burr covers double its present
whereabouts, growers may not be so philo-
sophical. In this State (Q.) there is every
prospect that the administration of noxious
weeds will be placed in the care of the much-
alive Prickly-pear Board. This will mean
that supplies of poison and apparatus will
be made available at about cost price. When
not on the burr-hunt the death-dealer can
be used to wipe out useless timber and
undergrowth.
ABOUT SHEEP-KILLING DOGS.
“lass”: Why has the Alsatian been
singled out and labelled a potential sheep-
killer? It cannot be on account of superior
size, speed or intelligence, as there are
other breeds in Australia larger, speedier
and even more intelligent; and some of them
are far more aggressive. The champions of
the breed claim that as the Alsatian is
really a sheepdog it is unlikely to harass
sheep, and this point has been eagerly
seized upon by its opponents, who say that
the most finished and expert killer of the
lot is the sheepdog “gone bush,” or the sheep-
dog-warrigal cross. There can be no denying
the truth of this, but even the most rabid
“anti-dingoite” would hardly recommend an
embargo on the importation and breeding of
kelpies and Border collies.
Intelligence is the main factor in the mak-
ing of a dangerous killer, and any breed
possessed of this quality in addition to
aggressiveness, when mated with a true
dingo, can be relied on to produce killers.
But if all intelligent breeds are declared
“black” Australia will have nothing left but
Poms, Pekes and poodles, and —dingoes.
The crossbred warrigal that causes all
the damage springs from the promiscuous
matings of mongrels of greyhound and ter-
rier types. The sort, known as “kangaroo-
dogs,” are like the greyhounds they are
descended from, and it is their nature to
chase and pull down whatever will run
from them, the terrier infusions in then-
blood giving them courage in cases where
there is likely to be any opposition.
I hold no brief for the Alsatian, being
interested only in kelpies as working sheep-
dogs, but I do like to see a fair deal.
FUMIGATING RABBIT-B URROWS.
“R.R.R.”: Rabbit-burrows are almost
invariably reopened after being fumigated,
either through the gas not reaching the
blind ends of the warren and thus leaving
some of the occupants alive, or by rabbits
from outside in search of ready-made homes.
After experimenting for years I found a
remedy. With the hole as the centre, cut the
soil the width and length of a super, bag and
remove all earth to a depth of about ten
inches. Prepare in this way every opening in
the warren. Fumigate with cyanide dust,
using the standard blower, and use the
exhaust from a motor-car to force the gas
through the warren. As the fumes appear
at each hole place a super, bag in the recess
previously prepared, replace the excavated
earth and trample firm. Either the combina-
tion of gases, or the power behind the
exhaust of the car, is responsible for greater
mortality than when car or blower is used
separately. Of course this method could not
be used with carbon bisulphide. The bag
gives the rabbit a lot of trouble in trying
to reopen the burrow, and also acts as a
blanket to prevent the escape of the gas.
TWIN CALVES.
“Sylvester”: F. Tobin, Dallarnil (Q.),
has a cow that had twins for two successive
years. All thrived, and this year she had
triplets, but. they did not live. She is an
Illawarra-Holstein cross.
G. W. Ferris, of Cooran (Q.), has an
Illawarra cow that has presented him with
seven calves within three years. They were
made up of a pair of bulls, then a single
bull, twin bulls again, and a few weeks ago
twins again, male and female. A few days
after the second twins were born this cow
won the championship at the Gympie show.
TAINTED MILK.
“P.M.” : “Finn’s” yarn about onion-tainted
butter (B. 15/9/’27) is a bit too thin. All
cream for butter manufacture has to be
passed by a licensed grader, and no- com-
petent grader would pass onion-tainted
cream, which is very easy to detect.
An old cocky in our district called in at
the factory the other day and wanted to
know what was wrong with his cream that
he was getting second grade. “Machine
flavor,” said the grader. “But I ain’t usin’
machines,” said the cocky. “But your cream
has a decided rubber flavor,” said the grader.
Dad scratched his head for a minute. “I’m
usin’ a piece of rubber milkin’-machine hose
to belt the heifers with when they play up,”
he said at length. “That must be doin’ it.”
“Kirk”: The onions and turnips mentioned
by “Finn” (B. 15/9/’27) are not the only
feeds which will taint milk. Cowgrass-clover
in the autumn will give cream a flavor strong
enough for the factories to complain about.
Rape, too, while the best milk-producer I
know, has this fault, but the difficulty may
be met to a large extent by letting the cows
feed on it for only a couple of hours just
after they are milked. Pouring a dipper of
boiling water into a four-gallon tin of milk
just before separating will help to remove
the taint.
English grasses and clovers and Cape bar-
ley produce the finest quality butter, silage
and bran following closely, but dry chaff
and mangels produce a butter that is hard
and that often has a taint. A good winter
fodder in Tas. is pea-straw, of which huu-
dreds of tons are wasted or burnt. Soaked
with molasses and mixed with boiling water
and a ration of bran or meal, it gives both a
good yield and good quality milk.
MOTOR v. HORSE.
“Janus”: The controversy as to whether
motor-traction is cheaper than the moke
variety continues to rage in America. The
horse’s friends swear tfiat for farm work
and short hauls he has the machine badly
beaten, and that farmers are returning from
mechanical power to the reliable old prad,
who is again increasing in the land. The
mechanicals have come back with some
figures which sound imposing. There are
nearly 350,000 more motor-trucks on farms
to-day than there were in 1920, and last
year farmers bred only 500,000 horses as
against 1,500,000 three years before. Prices
have dropped from an average of £l9 per
nag to £l4 15s. But motor prices have
dropped too, so that doesn’t go for much. It
is significant also that the case for the
motor only refers to trucks. Nothing is said
of the field-tractor, to which Dobbin is
reckoned by many to be a formidable rival
still.
CEMENT ON THE FARM.
“Gundy”: On most up-to-date farms the
old-time bush-timber structures are being
displaced by concrete. Timber has become
scarce and dear, and the quality inferior,
the result being that the comparative cost
of wood and cement, taking durability into
consideration, is much in favor of concrete.
I have used it for building dairies, milking-
sheds, stables, fowlhouses and garages; also
for making floors, drains, baths, wash-troughs,
pig-troughs, sinks, steps and gateposts.
Where clean gravel or good crushing stone
is obtainable, any fairly handy man can,
in liis spare time, fix up things very snugly
around his home. He can get a rudimentary
knowledge of mixing the requisite quanti-
ties by consulting some of the numerous
people who have had experience, or, better
still, by watching a job being done.
There is no set rule regarding the amount
of cement required, as the quantity varies
according to the quality of gravel or sand
used, and of course the use for which the
job is intended. But the average strength
will be found to be about six parts of
gravel to one of cement.
BIRDS AS SEED SPREADERS.
“E.S.W.”: “Biro” (B. 15/9/'27) need
have no fear that weed seeds will be spread
by quail. Certainly prickly-pear seeds are
spread by the emu, but the emu eats the
pears for the sake of the pulp, and passes
out the seeds unharmed. Exactly the same
thing happens in the case of the mistletoe-
bird, which digests the pulp of tin- berry only.
But the quail eats dry seeds, having no pulp,
and has to digest them thoroughly to get any
nourishment from them, the same as a com-
mon fowl feeding on maize or wheat. It is
the same with goldfinches, only more so. as
they divest the seed of its outer skin before
swallowing it. I have watched them in my
garden feeding on seeds of the small sun-
flower and the cosmos.
As to spreading seeds of the black thistle,
more is done by the wind in one day than
could be done by a million goldfinches in a
whole season, even if they are guilty of the
offence, which I don’t believe.
SEX OF EGGS.
“Curlew”; “Ino” (B. 15,/9/ ; 27) says the
sex of eggs may be determined by viewing the
egg in a dark room, allowing strong sunlight
to show on it; but admits “the method won't
work with eggs from different hens.” I
thought not—the only egg it is likely to
prove successful with is the egg of the Phoe-
nix. It is not possible to tell the sex of the
poultry embryo till comparatively well along
in its life. As for the germ occupying a cer-
tain position, if you take an ineubating-egg
after a few days and hold it up to a strong
light you will note something similar to a
spider on that side of the egg which had been
uppermost. Mark the object with a pencil.
Replace th e egg under the hen or in the
incubator. Examine it next day and mark
the position of the “spider.” If the egg has
been turned you will find the germ occupies
a fresh position—it's always on top of the
yolk.
INCUBATOR YIELDS.
“Jack Point” : An experienced poultryman,
who should have known better, said the other
day that though his incubator gave him only
hatches of about 60 per cent., the chicks were
bigger and healthier than those he had seen
from other machines wdiich gave a better
hatching percentage. Ten years ago 60
per cent, would have been considered a good
hatch, but to-day it is reckoned a poor one,
and a machine that can’t do better ought

to go to the scrapheap. Mammoth incuba-
tors are now manufactured that will give an S 5
per cent, average over the whole season,
and as high as 95 per cent, when conditions
are exceptionally favorable. And it is from
the machines which hatch these big percen-
tages that the most healthy and vigorous
chicks are obtained. When a machine
hatches only 60 per cent., the embryos that
don’t hatch die because conditions were not
what they should have been, whilst those that
do come out have their vitality impaired
right from the start.
SOFT-SHELLED EGGS.
“Homo”: To prevent soft-shelled eggs
being numbered in the daily gathering, get
rid of all aged hens. Three years is a fair
time to keep even a very good cliook. Stimu-
lating the fowls to lay by giving them hot
foods and cayenne or similar condiments is
a frequent cause of soft shells, and shortens
the time of best-laying. Hens so stimulated
should be got rid of at the end of the season.
It is foolish to keep a hen that has laid a
soft-shelled egg, as the cause may be weak-
ness of the egg-tract. Lime or sliell-grit, or
both, should be available always, as ordinary
grit aids digestion only.
FIGHTING THE CODLIN-MOTH.
“H.M.”: Cleanliness is the first .essential
in the fight against the codlin-moth. Often a
clean orchard is infected by returned cases
from the markets in which are sheltering
moths from other growers. To obviate this,
saturate the cases in lib. soda to 20 gallons
of boiling water. Bandaging is an effective
remedy. Strips of wool-bale or corn sack
about nine inches wide should be tied near
the base of the tree. Leave a fold facing
downward in the top of the bandage as a
shelter for moths, and at least once a week
make a tour of inspection. Every bandage
should be removed and examined, and then
dipped into a bucket containing soda and
boiling water. Windfall fruit is often a
means of spreading the disease. Soft, fruits
can be gathered and given to poultry—
peaches or pears, for instance —but ijt’s
safer to burn them.
The N.S.W. Department of Agriculture’s
regulations for the control of codlin require
that apple, pear and quince trees shall be
sprayed three times a year with arsenate of
lead in the proportion of 18oz. dry powder
or 21b. of paste to 50 gallons of water.
The first spraying should be made when
the first signs of the closing of any of
the calyxes appear—it should not be delayed
more than five days; the second spraying
must be given two weeks after the first
treatment; and the final spraying during the
ninth or tenth week after the fall of the
petals. Trees must be kept clean of loose
bark, and broken limbs, which must be
burnt.
CO-OPERATION FOR TOMATO-
GROWERS.
“B. Fair”: My sympathies are with the
tomato-growers of N.S.W. Some pulping
factories pay £8 per ton and others only £5
per ton. Most of the pulp is used for sauces,
and one firm proudly proclaims that there
are 21b. of tomatoes in. every bottle of sauce.
The cost to the factory of this quantity is
a shade over a halfpenny—and there’s
precious little else than tomatoes in a bottle
of sauce. I believe that the wholesale price
of the sauce is 9s. 6d. per dozen. At
Bathurst, the growers are talking about set-
ting up a marketing board and establishing
a co-operative pulping plant. The board
would fix a minimlnn price for the district,
and the factories would either have to pay
it or let the co-operative plant take the lot.
Under the Marketing of Primary Products
Acts existing contracts may be avoided, so
that the co-operators would be in a strong
position.
RETICULATING BORE WATER.
“Larrapinta”: “N.M.L.” (B. l/9/’27)
didn’t mention that in making channels for
artesian water it’s as well to be sure
about the levels. This is important. Even
qualified surveyors made mistakes in the
south-eastern drainage system and the Love-
day irrigation channels (S.A.), as I saw for
myself when they were being altered. A
friend of mine tried to save money by laying
out the fall on his drains, leading from a
bore by guesswork, and it cost hundreds of
pounds to get the mistakes rectified by a sur-
veyor. Water will not run uphill, and only
with a theodolite can one lay out a gradual
fall (such as two feet in a mile) accurately.
GRASS ROOTS AS PIG-FEED.
“Kayeff”: A Gunnedah (N.S.W.) cocky
I know pulled through a nasty drought by
inventing a new. way of feeding pigs. He
had a river-front property and let a crowd
of porkers run loose in a river paddock.
Their lunches wer e provided by ploughing
a few furrows daily along the length of the
paddock and turning up the roots of the
Johnstone grass with which the paddock had
been sown. The grunters would rush this
fodder when freshly turned, and then stroll
to th e river for a quiet mud bath. About
300 pigs were kept, and the cheque received
for them brought enough to plank down a
deposit on a small pump and engine, with
which he irrigated a small paddock of
lucerne. A bumper crop resulted, and, as
lucerne was fetching £22 10s. a ton, he was
able to remind neighbors eager to purchase
of the guffaws with which they had greeted
his pig venture."
COCOA NUT-SCALE COMBATED.
“Tanna”: Men in the copra trade have
reason to bless the name of Dr. Tothill. an
entomologist lent by the Canucks some three
years ago to investigate the dangerous dis-
ease known as cocoanut-scale. This is
common right through the Pacific, and in
some places is a menace to the copra indus-
try. The remedy has been the introduction
from Malaya of a tiny beetle with a special
partiality for the scale. A number of these
have been introduced to the Windward
group, and so successful have they proved
there and elsewhere that further quanti-
ties have been ordered, this time from the
West Indies, where they are employed on the
same class of work. The success of the
Canadian’s experiment will mean the saving
of thousands of pounds wherever the cocoa-
nut is grown ; and Australia, with her big
interests in coeoanut-growing, will benefit
with others.
GIDYA POISONING.
“N.M.L.”: On the Georgina River, W.Q.,
from about 50 miles north of Boulia to
about 50 miles north of Urandangie cattle
die every year, from the end of September
till the rains, from what is locally called
“gidya poison.” During normal years the
thing has little effect, and only fat bul-
locks run much risk. But years come, such
as 1918, when there’s a sweeping epidemic,
and cattle go down irrespective of age,
sex or condition. Some put it down to gid-
ya. others to fuchsia.
The symptoms of the poison are: First,
a fit of staggers, then incessant shivering, a
drink of water, a drop to the ground, a
short struggle with acute pain, judging by
the sounds, and then death. If there’s no
water, then death comes after a short run.
As the name suggests, most people believe
gidya is the means of destruction. But
that isn’t clear. In the first place, it's not
a true gidya which grows in that country.
The real gidya—the “old-man stinker”—
flowers only once in about seven years. Its
pods are broad and squat, carrying little
seed. The proper gidya dies if lopped or
cut off at the stump. The hybrid, which
flourishes on the Georgina, flowers every
year about August. Its pods are long and
slender, twisting like an attenuated cork-
screw, and its seeds are many. It doesn’t
infallibly die if cut off at the stump. I know
miles of a survey line where the plant, cut off
a foot from the ground, is sprouting from
the stumps. In Central Q., where there is
as much true gidya as anyone could wish to
see, the flowering and podding of the plants
bring no disaster in their train.
I’ve seen, and others have, too, cattle
feeding on gidya pods on the western side
of the river, and doing well. And on the
eastern side, but eight miles out. during
1918 I put 38 head of mixed cattle on a bore.
It was an experiment that wasn’t repeated.
Thirty-eight carcases rotted on the ground
within a month of putting them there, all
within a hundred yards of the watering
place.
There are, I think, seven varieties of
fuchsia. On the western side of the Geor-
gina, for several miles out from the river,
there is none. On the eastern side it runs
riot. But that doesn’t mean that you can
blame the fuchsia entirely. I’ve noted, and
others have Seen, cattle feeding on fuchsia
with immunity. But, where there is fuchsia,
and where and when the gidya is in pod,
then most certainly death follows. I have
taken cattle off country where fuchsia was
flourishing, and as soon as I took them
through a patch of podding gidya they
shook as with ague and dropped to die. I
have taken cattle from' gidya country free
of fuchsia through a belt of fuchsia, and
the result was the same. Is it the combina-
tion that is poisonous? It looks like it.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“,T.G.” : As this is the best period of the
year for grafting of fruit and other trees,
here’s a receipe for grafting wax: Three
parts of mutton tallow, two parts of bees-
wax, and three parts of resin. These should
be slowly melted together, and when melted
should be cooled in water, and then well
worked in the hands until it is like soft
putty. The hands should be well greased
before the working up is commenced. If
the wax is to be used in a very warm
climate rub in less mutton fat and more
beeswax. This grafting wax is used upon
the graft without the aid of paper or cloth
strips. Another good mixture is: Three
parts of mutton fat, four parts of resin and
one part of hard yellow soap, all well
melted together. When boiling, the stuff
should be painted upon strips of rag or
paper, and these then bound round the
graft. The waxed strips when fixed into
position should have some more of the stuff
painted over them, giving the graft an air-
and weather-tight covering.
“X.L.”: Suckers growing towards the
centres of peach and plum trees should be
removed. Also keep the young growth off
the trunk base, where it forms a refuge for
aphis, ants, etc. After the fruit has set, a
sprinkle of bonedust dug in at the root of
the tree will act as a tonic.
“E.W.”: The black aphis which infests
broad beans and chrysanthemum plants can
be got rid of by spraying every three days
with soapy water. The washing-day water
will do, but it is well to strain it to clear
out any cotton or fluff which might clog the
nozzle of the spray.
“Pick”: When there’s a doubt of the
dryness of hay just stacked, and fear of
spontaneous combustion, look for a haze
over the summit of the stack. If a shimmer
similar to that seen oyer a burning brick-kiln
or the crest of a hill-road in mid-summer
appears, get to work at once. Fork out a
perpendicular opening two-tliirds through
from the roof. This wall admit air and cool
the stack.
“Hide Hopples”: A good dressing to
apply to cuts and abrasions on stock is
made by mixing three parts of castor-oil
and one part liquid slieep-dip. Paint it
on with a light brush or feather. The
mixture will go to a jelly, so stir it each
time you apply .it. It is also very good for
footrot in sheep.
“Sylvester” : Here’s a cure for mammitis •
Mix one part of kerosene with two parts of
separator-oil. Rub the mixture well into
the affected quarter and repeat at each
milking until a cure is effected. There is
no danger of burning the udder if these
proportions are used.
“Nota Bene”: If your horse, gets at the
wheat and over-gorges, dissolve about two
dessertspoonfuls of baking soda in about a
pint of water, add one teaspoonful of
ground ginger and give to Dobbin through a
drenching bit.
For “water gripes” in horses, dissolve half
a teaspoonful of saltpetre in a pint of warm
water, and administer through a drenching
bit. If you haven’t got a drenching bit
mix up twice the given quantities, and give
approximately half. Without the bit you’re
almost sure to spill some.

HABOLD HARDUPP.
A SEA FIGHT.
“All abord!” shouted the captain of an
ocean-bound Liner as he cast the ropes off
with one hand, while with the other he pre-
paired to throw the gang-plank ashore. To
liis amazement, the Agger of
a Lad of 16 or 17 came
dashing up the plank just
as it was shoved Backword,
and, making a leap over the
Ever-widening Gap, _ sprang
a-bord, nearly knocking him
over. By this time the ship
was well under way.
“Avast there ! Port your
helm, you Lubber! Shiver
my timbers,’' said the rough
old Sea Dog, “but who may
you be, yong Master?”
“My name is Jack Dare-
all,” said Our Hero fear-
lously, “and I have Run
Away from home. I am an
orphan, my mother and
father being dead; and I
have a Wicked Unckle who
has robbed me of my Estates
and will not even let me go
to pictur shows.”
“Belay!” cried the honest
sailor, indiggernently.
“Peple who don’t let boys
go to pictur-sliows should he
flogged.”
[Anther’s note : This need-
less crulety of parrents and
others is pityusly common.
The anther himself in his
youth, indeed not more than
two days ago, was blokked from going to
the picturs by a crule parrent. . But I will
deal with this els-wear.]
“He is a cruel man,” said Our Hero, “and
even now he will have his Bloodhounds on
•uy track.”
The honist sailor looked into his fereless
blue eyes, and knew that he spoke the Truth.
“Never fear, my harty,” he said, shakking
Our Hero’s hand in his monstrous pore,
“they will never take you.”
A great frenship sprang up between Our
Hero and the Rough Salt, who admired the
way Jack was not see-sick even in the ter-
riffic gail that sprang up drectly they left
Sidney Harbor. The vessel, of wich Captin
Higins was justerly Proud, Shook off the
heveing seas like the water of a duck’s back.
Too days later when the craft was orf
Baron Joey the Captain came to Jack with
a grave face.
“They have discover’d that you are on
bord,” he said. “I picked up a wireless that
Warships have been sent in persute, and a
Japanees man-of-war has been asked to
intercept us. But, never fear, I will defend
you to the Last.”
Even as Jack thanked him a man-of-war
might have been seen coming full Tare over
the liorizian. Wen it came within range
the Japanese flag was run up to the Mast-
head, and a shell wisslcd between the masts
and funnels of the Liner.
“Evidently they do not want to Sink us,”
said the Captain thought-
fully ; “they want us to sur-
render. But no ! Shiver my
timbers, I will fight to the
Last Ditch.” And he gave
orders for the guns to be run
out.
A stern chase is allways a
Long Chase; but, in spite of
the best speed tin* Liner
could acchieve, it became evi-
dent that the warship would
draw level.
“They intend to bord us,”
said the Cap’ll as lie handed
out the Cutlasses, “but we
will surprise them. We will
bord Them. You go below,
lad, and keep out of this.”
Jack went below, but lie had no intension
of keeping out of the fight. He remembered
noticing a couple of bombs which had been
left behind in his Cabin by an anachist pas-
senger who was Arested when the vessel
had last reched Sydney.
As the warship scrapped alongside the sea-
men, led by' their Galant Capt, sprang on to
her deck with a Harty British cheer. The
.Taps were taken by supprise; but the galant
borders were Hoplessly Outnumbbered and
it might have Gone Hard w’ith them. At
that momment, however, a youthful figger
with a cutlass between his teeth and a
smoking bomb in each hand appeared in the
midst, changing the fortune of the fight.
“Sureuder or I blow you all to Bits!”
showted Our Hero.
The Japs immedjetly Surrendered, the
Admiral handing his sord to Jack, who said
polittely that such a galant foe could keep
it.
Captain Iligins came to Jack with a series
look in his Ryes. “I forgot,” he said, “that
we are not at War with Japan. All we can
do is to appolagise to the Admiral, make him
prommise not to mollest us, and hand back
the ship.”
“Not so fast,” said Our Hero, and He
showed the Captain a message that had just
come by wireless :
“Warning to Ships: War has been just
declared "with Japan. Rang, Premier.”
All Sydney turned out to cheer as the
Liner brout into the Harbor the first mag-
ernificent prize, tin l loss of which made
NO REFLECTIONS' ALLOWED ON THE PIPE.
“Boss bin gibbit Mary new pipe.”
“Stem’s a bit short, isn’t it?”
“No fear! Pipe him all right. Mary lip him too
long!”
Japan soo for peas. Jack became the Hero
of the Hour.
The King gave him a Knighthood and
made him Governor of New South Walev.
The wicked unckle, Ashamed of his Conduct,
committed suicide; and with his share of the
prize-money Jack built a pictur-show at
Government House.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL the morning a sense of impending
calamity had lain upon me heavily;
indeed it had been with me when I
had wrestled with my sermon until far past
midnight. Somehow I had postponed the
task of writing the sermon until the last
minute; I could not help thinking that it
was an intuition of some message which I
was to deliver, the purport of which was
as yet unknown to me.
It was a sense of this that made the
preparation difficult. Every phrase I pre-
pared seemed a futility compared with the
words that I should say. Yet on the Sunday
morning there seemed nothing untoward in
the general aspect of the day. It was one
of those bright mornings on which the whole
world seems to be praising its Maker; the
one queer thing about it seemed to be the
swift flight of time. When my wife reminded
nve that it was time to go to the morning
service, her call was almost a shock.
The sensation of that morning’s sermon
I am unable to describe. What I said was
impromptu, put into my lips by the unseen
agency that had been Dying to press its
message upon me. All through the service
I had been grappling, with a sense of futile
Comprehension, with the Something that I
felt to be in the air; but soon after I had
ascended the pulpit I put aside my notes
and commenced to pour out words of earnest
entreaty to my congregation to repent while
they had time, to endeavor to bring all they
knew to repentance before the calamity that
was to come, so that they would be fit to
meet it. What I said I cannot remember;
but I know that the sweat drops fell from
my forehead, and, at one point, I cried in
the earnestness of my appeal.
The congregation was stirred, and after-
wards the wardens and some of the other
leaders gathered round me, alarmed out of
their smugness. The effort had exhausted me r
and immediately I reached the rectory I fell
into a weary sleep. I did not sleep long;
but when I awoke the world was in dark-
ness. Yet my watch showed that it was but
half-past two.
The whole thing fell upon me with a start.
A sense of dreadful unreality gripped me.
With swift steps I went out on the balcony,
which takes in a widespread view of roof-
tops, from which the glowing towers of the
Post Office and the Town Hall jutted into
the night. The world was flooded in a weird
green atmosphere, which was not yet com-
plete darkness; above it hurried ominous
thin clouds that were silver and heavy black-
ness ; and through the silvered portion
floated a pale moon, to disappear now and
again behind the black masses. The clouds
skurried as if pursued by fear.
The clocks of the city confirmed my watch,
a trusted timepiece which has never failed
cither myself or my father, who was its first
owner. A sense of an awful change in the
world came to me. The life in the street
below destroyed the swift hope that I had
only imagined the .shortness of my sleep,
and had really slept through until early
morning; there were there the yonng men
in their white trousers, the picnickers with
their parcels, who had been desecrating the
day, and were now hurrying home. I
noticed some of their apprehensive looks at
the sky, a sense of their panic filtering in
and augmenting my own.
There was no intimation of any eclipse
to explain the phenomenon. With the scien-
tific knowledge of the day, there must have
been a radical change in the conditions of
our world to have brought this phase unan-
nounced. It immediately came to me that it
was a warning of this, and of worse things
to follow, that had been sent to me.
Was it, indeed, the approaching end of
the world, of all things? I was, I hoped,
ready to meet my Maker whenever He should
call; there is nothing dreadful in individual
death, but when I thought of the destruction
of all the world, the sinful, the children —the
extinction of life—l was crushed by the
weight of horror.
Immediately thinking of my family, I
hurried down to them. They crowded around
me. their horror and alarm only too evident.
Two of my wardens were there, too, pale-
faced and agitated.
It was the time for religious strength to
rise above human weakness. Calling upon
them to be of good courage, I commanded
them to kneel, and together we poured out a
supplication to the Almighty to. if it were
possible in His will, avert the calamity that
was apparently to fall upon mankind; but
if that was not in accordance with His will,
to help us to meet the end with fortitude.
The sound of the frightened sobbing of my
children tugged at my heart as 1 prayed.
Almost it stirred in me a feeling of rebellion
against the Divine omnipotence.
The wardens nodded when I asked them if
the people had assembled in the church. It
gave me a glow to hear they were assembl
ing; naturally in the hour of need they
would turn to the Power so many of them
had neglected. My wife clung to me as I
turned to go ; my children also. A sense of
sacrifice was natural as I put them aside,
preferring to follow my path of duty to
remaining, where my heart would have
liked to be, to comfort my loved ones. The
wardens also, who seemed paralysed by the
circumstances that had arisen, seemed reluc-
tant that I should go.
"I am a minister of the Gospel, and I will
do my duty to the end,” I told them,
solemnly.
The church was crowded as I faced the
congregation; the spirit of excitement and
apprehension conveyed itself to me directly I
entered. An effort was made to start the
service in a formal manner, but I promptly
suppressed it. This was no time for the for-
malities of religion, but for waking in the
hearts of my people that spirit of true re-
pentance which would enable them to face
whatever was to befall. Yet so used had they
grown to formalities that it seemed to me
the choir looked astonished as I interrupted
them to plunge immediately into my exhor-
tation.
Just what was happening had come to me
whilst I had prayed. The world had accel-
erated, and was now spinning through space
in a manner which abridged the days as we
were accustomed to know them. Unfortu-
nately my knowledge of the sciences, although
PRO-STRIKE.
“I was altogether in sympathy with the Queensland railway strike.”
“So you’re a Communist?”
“Not exactly. You see, the wife was in Brisbane at the time.”
they have always interested me, was elemen-
tary; still I was able to sketch to my people
some idea of what was to happen. Perhaps,
I told them, the impulse that had been given
to the earth by some unseen force was only a
temporary impetus which would gradually
lose its effect, allowing the world’s motion,
by the mercy of God, to return to normal;
hut if this was to be the end of the world it
might be that the increased friction of the
earth in the surrounding atmosphere would
create a condition of heat which would re-
suit in its destruction, as we knew it. In
that event—or in any other, for it was not
for us to say. how God was working—there
would be probably days for repentance and
setting their souls at peace. With tears in
my eyes I exhorted them to that repentance.
There were moans, gasps of horror and
sobs from the congregation as I continued;
looking round, I could see blanched faces, and
faces upon which tears glistened—faces of
people I loved as my personal friends and
my parishioners; loved for their sins as well
as for their deal, kindly hearts. And a voice
from the midst of the congregation cried out
in anguish : “Stop him ! For God’s sake, stop
him !” I knew from cries like these that I
was ploughing their hearts with the fears of
the horror that was on the world ; but it was
my duty.
When the sermon was over they crowded
around me; there were those who sobbed
as they pressed my hand; the dim, big lights
shone on the horrified pale faces all around
me. “Peace be upon you !” I cried, almost
sobbed.
Dr. Thomas was in my house when I
returned; he was one of my church’s best
men, and it startled me to remember that I
had not seen him in the church. But imme-
diately I knew that he also had had his
mission, trying to bring peace to those who
would not come to church, checking what
might have been a disorderly panic amongst
the public. Even in my house he had used
the pretence he had evidently adopted else-
where ; they had altered the clocks in the
house to make it seem that all the effects of
the change in the world’s motion was in
our imagination. He went away, saying he
would return, after imploring us all to be
calm and to rest.
It seemed good advice to my family; and,
one by one, reluctantly, the poor, terrified
souls obeyed my command to retire. As for
myself, I could not go, although occasionally
from sheer weariness 1 dozed. Sometimes
when I stood up 1 could feel the quiver of
the earth in its new madness of speed ;
sometimes a sort of jolt that made me antici-
pate a sudden end. Almost I regretted
having dismissed my family; it would have
been a comfort, when the end did come,
for us all to die together.
It seemed dreadful that God should put
upon mankind the torture of this, waiting.
Shocked, I quelled such rebellion in my
mind; yet it recurred. I stole around the
house, creeping to the bedside of my loved
ones. My, daughter, my eldest daughter,
my favorite, was sobbing. “Father, oh
father!” she cried out in her sleep as I
stood beside her. The cry sent a pang to
my heart. In another two months she was
to have married; her lover was on the point
of taking his vacation from his mission in
China. Only God knew what was happen-
ing to him now. That she should go, with
all her bright hopes before her, seemed the
essence of cruelty. Why had the Creator
made this vast machinery of human life
merely for its destruction?
Weariness must have driven me to sleep
again; when I awoke Dr. Thomas was
standing before me. He tried to smile
cheerfully, but it was in reality a wan
smile; evidently the horror of what the
world was facing had fallen upon him also.
There was a grey light in the room which
told me that day had come. I plucked
frantically at the watch in my pocket. It
showed that the time was five and twenty
to eleven.
A cry of anguish was forced from me.
Since sunrise the last morning the world
had spun round in 14 hours! If its speed
had increased by 10 hours in one day, at
what rate would it be revolving to-morrow?
“No, no!” Dr. Thomas said, as I held
the watch up to him. “By the look of
things it is only about seven o’clock.
For answer I caught him by the arm.
and, throwing back -the heavy curtains, led
him on to the balcony. With new horror
I saw the sun just appearing in the east,
hanging in the sky like a red orb of wrath.
“Look!” I cried, “The clocks show it is
five and twenty to eleven!”
And then the horror became too much for
me and I fainted, to awake in that awful
chaos of events which came with the End.
But, at last, out of the chaos, peace was
given to me. I am here, secluded, but with
ease upon my soul. Heaven is not what
I expected to find it; but sometimes the
spirits of those I love are permitted to see
me. And, as I say, there is peace.
# * * *
“The basis of his peculiar hallucination,”
said Dr. Thomas, as he handed the curious
document to me, “was his faith in his
watch, which had gone wrong for the
first time in its 50 years’ history. Of course,
he was due for the mental breakdown:
but that is what the madness fastened
upon. By a coincidence the tower clocks
showed ten past six when his watch stood
at half-past two, and eight minutes to seven
when his watch showed five and twenty
minutes to eleven; it was easy for him to
mistake the hands. After his first mad out-
break in church, news of which brought
crowds to the evening service, everything,
including the grief of his family and the
agitation of his wardens—even the pleasure-
makers hurrying home to avert a threatening
storm—helped the hallucination.”

Flowerdale.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s spring now in Flowerdale, and sadly I
remember
The rosy kirtled apple-trees, the silver
snooded pear.
The tree that dreams a golden dream, gay
plumage of September,
Along the road to Flowerdale, and I’m
still here.
I wish they wouldn’t come again, these days
of fluting birds.
In the terraces of tea-trees are little green
winds born
To help the spring write little songs in
white and yellow words.
How can I be listening, with my poor
heart so torn?
She's travelled round the earth again, this
wanton gipsy vagrant
Whose camp-fire is the crimson of the
mountain waratah.
She’s wakened in the hearts of men the old
wild things and fragrant,
Rut I wish she wouldn’t wake me, things
are better as they are.
What is new in Flowerdale? The crescent
moon, and vespers
Of little feathered choristers that long
seemed still.
Thick-dusted dews of starlight where a
low voice whispers
The miracle of sap and leaf with mounting
life athrill.
What is old in Flowerdale? This, that Love
is lying
Underneath the breaking buds, long and
long a-cold.
Nothing now will waken him, never tears,
nor sighing—
Ah. Love, the dew of life! Love, though
honey gold!

Information Sought.
A newsagent in Perth charged me 9 d. for
a copy of The Bulletin. Is he entitled
to do so? —1795.
ISo agent in Australia is permitted to
charge more than. 6d. for The Bulletin.
Immediate steps will be taken to stop this
practice when we hear of it.
How can I rid my orchard of conch grass?
—l6lO.
Shallow ploughing and thorough cultiva-
tion is recommended, the roots being removed
and burn. Constant attention is necessary
to keep this grass in check.
I have had two scenarios rejected by
American cos., and have later seen them pro-
duced on the screen under different titles.
Would a copyright in America ensure me
honest treatment? —l693.
The American copyright law, while
covering the finished motion-picture play,
does not adequately protect a scenario. To
quote an American authority: “A scenario
cannot be properly regarded as a dramatic
composition, since it is only a preliminary
step in the creation of a drama, and not in
itself a complete work. In some cases, how-
ever, where scenarios have been elaborately
worked out with details of action and dia-
logue, registrations have been permitted for
them as dramatic compositions not repro-
duced for sale. The circumstances of each
case must determine whether a scenario is
classifiable as a dramatic composition or not.
Certainly a brief synopsis of plot and action
is not entitled to such a classification.” Of
course, scenarios are entitled to protection
at common law against unwarranted use,
but the difficulty is—and more so since you
are in Australia—to prove, without copy-
right, its authorship.
I have two volumes of “The Dore Gal-
lery,” covers a bit torn —what is their value?
—1631.
People are not interested in engravings at
present. From a private buyer you might
get 10s. for the two volumes. Trade offer
would be much lower.
Are the parents of an adult idiot entitled
to maintenance? —l664.
The invalid pension possibly covers the
case. Application should be made to the
nearest Clerk of Petty Sessions, setting out
the particulars, together with a medical
certificate stating the nature and permanency
of applicant’s incapacity. The income and
property of the parents would have to be
considered.
Where can I get information about my
grandfather, said to have been N.S.W. Chief
Surveyor some time prior to 1839? —1649.
Send his full name and further search
will be made.
Can you give me the name of a book which
deals with the craftsmanship of short-story
writing ? —l6Bl.
“The Short Story,” by E. M. Albright
(14s. Id.) ; “The Art of Story Writing,” by
N. C. Fowler (6s. 5d.) ; “Short-Story Writ-
ing for Profit,” by M. Joseph (Bs. 6d.) ;
“A Handbook on Story Writing” (14s. Id.).
Prices include postage. All obtainable from
Dymock’s Book Arcade, 428 George-street,
Sydney. Doubt whether an amateur can
learn much from textbooks upon the sub-
jects. Generally they are helpful only in
pointing out the things one should know
before commencing to write.
Has canary seed any use other than as
bird seed? —1627.
Department of Agriculture knows of no
other use, but the green crop is useful for
grazing.
What is the treatment for sand-colic in
horses? —1709.
Give 4oz. soft-soap, loz. water, paraf-
fin as a drench in 15oz. water. Repeat on
the following day. The animal should be
kept quiet. Water in moderate quantities
is beneficial if inclined to drink. Give lib.
of boiled linseed as a mash once a week.
Is the timber of the umung-tree valuable
for furniture- or piano-making?, —l76o.
The umung-tree is not known to the
N.S.W. Forestry Commission, but probably
you refer to Acacia sdlicina, one of the large
acacias of mahogany color. This timber
would be valuable for furniture, and although
not used in piano-making should be suit-
able, as it polishes well. The value of a log
would range from £3 to £lO.
I have a man clearing by contract. Should
I have him insured under the Vic. Work-
men’s Compensation Act? —-1737.
The Vic Workers’ Compensation Act of
1922 specially includes as workers con-
tractors engaged in clearing land of stumps.
It would be compulsory for you to effect a
policy in respect of such liability with either
the Government office, 473-481 Bourke-street,
Melbourne, or other approved insurer.
What are the contents and construction
of thorium pastilles, which, with oxygen- and
acetylene-gases, give the same lighting results
for cinema work as electric light? —ls2o.
Study the Welsbach gas-mantel patents;
they may help you to devise a method of con-
structing the article you require. The for-
mula to which you refer- is a secret.
Hoio does Hawkesbury Lookout-road,
Springwood, run. through to Richmond, and,
if so, how many miles is it?, —1630.
There is a clear road to the Look-out, but
from the top of the cliff only a narrow bridle-
track goes to the river below, whence a sandy
track carries local traffic to Richmond. Only
one car is known to have passed down the
bridle-track; two days were required in the
descent. Approximate distance, 16 miles.
(1) How is 1 in 8 crossing ( points )
measured? What lead is required from end
of blade to end of crossing? (2) Can you
recommend a book on plate-laying? —ls6l.
(1) Too vague. You do not state the. kind
of crossing, whether a straight lead or a
similar contrary (lecture, nor do you give
particulars as to gauge, size of rails, etc.
(2) “Textbook on Plate-laying,” by 11. C.
Judd, Government Printer, Sydney (55.).
My sewing machine is a Davis—a very old
make. I have broken the thread controller.
Where can I get a new part? —ls9l.
Not stocked in Sydney, but you could have
the part repaired by the Pinnock Sewing
Machine Co., 72 Druitt-street, Sydney. Send
the broken part, packed carefully, and ask
for an estimate.
Can you recommend some books on com-
mercial correspondence and on etiquette in
letter-writing ? —1682.
“Commercial Correspondence,” by Butler
and Burd (16s. 7d.) ; “Modern Commercial
Correspondence,” by Crebby (4s. 4d.) ; “The
Correspondence of Commerce,” by Palmer

How is an aneroid barometer read for (1)
weather indications and (2) determining
altitude?— l7l2.
(1) A falling barometer, generally speak-
ing, indicates the approach of! unsettled
weather, and fine weather usually follows a
rising barometer, but, as topography and
other factors have to be considered, it
is impossible to lay down general rules.
If an observation of the barometer, wind
direction and force be made at 9 a.m. each
day and used in conjunction with the
weather chart published in the daily press
a fair indication of the progress and ulti-
mate effect of the pressure systems might
be obtained. Purchase a textbook, use the
weather chart and profit; by experience.
(2) Pressure decreases, approximately, lin.
in every 1000 ft. of ascent. The reading
should be noted prior to and at the termina-
tion of the ascent, and the difference in the
readings of the barometer converted into
feet. As the atmospheric pressure is con-
tinually changing in accordance with the
movement of the pressure systems, a correc-
tion to overcome this should be applied.
What is the best way to eradicate hoary
cress? — 1170.
A trial might be made by spraying the
weed with a 5 to 7 per cent, solution cf
copper sulphate at the rate of 70 gallons per
acre. This spray is fatal to most weeds
belonging to the cabbage family, of which
hoary cress is a member.
When should 1 .close a paddock to save
subterranean clover seed? —1613.
Paddock should be closed from stock when
the clover commences to flower during the
spring. The exact time will vary according
to the district ana seasonal conditions. The
seeed is obtained by raking up the plants
after they have died off. Threshing can be
done with a harvester fitted up as a station-
ary thresher.
What is meant by proof spirit, 30 under
proof and 20 over proof? —l64B.
Proof spirit under the British laws is de-
fined to be of such density that at a tempera-
ture of 51deg. F. it weighs 12-13ths of equal
volume of distilled water. It has a density
at a temperature of 60deg. (15.5 deg. C.) of
.91984, and contains 49.24 p.c. by weight and
57.06 p.c. by volume of absolute alcohol.
Absolute alcohol is that which at 60deg. F.
(15.5 deg. C.) has a density of 0.7938 and
contains 175.25 p.c. by volume of proof
spirit; 30 under proof is 30 p.c. below proof,
and 20 over proof is 20 p.c. above.
I have taken a six weeks' course in N. S.
Wales in ladies’ hairdressing. What wages
am I entitled to if I obtain a position, and
do I come under any award? —1376.
Girls not under 15 and not over 18 are
apprenticed to the trade for four years. If
they have not reached 22 years at end of
apprenticeship they are termed improvers and
remain as such until they reach 22, when
they are classed as journeywomen. Appren-
tices are paid for the first year 17s. 4d. per
week; second, £1 55.; third, £2 2s. 6d.;
fourth, £3 Is. 2d. Improvers are paid first
year, £3 7s. 9d.; second, £3 17s. 5d.; and
third, £4 ss. Journeywomen are paid £5 ss.
or £5 155., according to class of work. Work
and wages are governed by Female Hair-
dressers’ (State) Award (copy posted). Get
in touch with Hairdressers’ Employees’
Union, Trades Hall, Sydney.
I am being financed in' certain dealings.
In the event of failure can my backer compel
me to sell my settlement-purchase block to
make up the loss? —1787.
He cannot compel you to sell anything.
He can only compel you to pay what you
owe him. This he may do by suing for the
debt, and if not then paid he may take by
execution so much of your goods as by sale
will satisfy both debt and costs.
Can you give me some information about
apostle spoons? —l6BB.
Apostle spoons are usually of silver or
silver gilt, with the handles terminating in
figures of the apostles, each bearing its dis-
tinctive emblem. They were common bap-
tismal gifts during the fifteenth and six-
teenth centuries, but were dying out by 1666.
Often single spoons were given, bearing the
figure of the patron or name saint of the
child. Sets of the 12 Apostles are not com-
mon, and complete sets of 13, with the figure
of Our Lord on a larger spoon are still rarer.
Such a set, bearing the hall-mark of 1626,
was sold at Christie’s in 1904 for £4900. As
you are in Sydney you could consult W. J.
Cripp’s “Old English Plate” and Arthur
Hayden’s “Chats on Old Silver” at the
Public Library, Bent-street.
Can you tell me briefly the mythological
characters, Bragi, Idun and the Huldra folk
mentioned in Myra Morris's verse, “Sweet
Bragi's Harp Is Still”? —.1714.
In Northern mythology, Bragi was a son
of Odin, and the god of music; he charmed
the world with liis harp, playing through the
flowery months of the year. From him
derive the braga men—or scalds. The Huldra
folk were the nymphs of Huldra, a goddess
of the earth. They were special protectors
of cattle among the mountains, and the tip
of a cow’s tail was often seen to protrude
from their clothes as they danced on the
village greens. Idun was the fair daughter
of Invald. a goddess of immortal youth and
beauty, only appearing in spring. She is
the symbol of springing vegetation.
In the event of a bachelor, resident in
America for a number of years, dying there
and leaving no will, would cousins share
in the estate even though he had brothers
and sisters? —1603.
There are 48 States, several Territories
and the District of Columbia in the U.S.A.
Each has its own statute law on the subject of
descent and distribution, and the provisions
differ considerably. In some there is a dif-
ference between the descent of real property
and of personal property. An examination
of the synopsis of the laws of several of the
States indicates that generally, in the case
you instance, the . cousins would not share.
There appear to be exceptions to this rule.
Communicate with the Australian Commis-
sioner, Cunard Building, 25 Broadway, New
York, U.S.A. To simplify the inquiry advise
in what State the man died; in what State
he was domiciled at the time of his death ;
and in what State or States he left real or
personal property.
A husband consents to a. maintenance
order being made against him,. Can he appeal
to the Court to grant mm access to the
children ? —1724. , ,
Take a copy of the order to the local
C.P.S. and ascertain if excluded from access
to the children. If so, the Court can be
approached to have the order varied.
Do you know of any doctor m Perth
( VC.A.) who has done the Steinach rejuvena-
tion operation on animals or human beings?
—1746.
The Bulletin does not know of any
medical man doing Steinach’s operations in
Perth on either animals or man.
What is the value of a N.S.W. twopenny
‘laureate,” postmark 1871? —1680.
Last of the “laureates” was issued in
1854. The stamp is probably a “diadem,”
issued in 1871, the value about 2d.
Information Supplied.
1259. —If fruit-trees are painted with a
mixture of lime, cow-dung and rabbit blood
mixed with a little water, no rabbit or hare
will touch the tree. Another method is to
put circles of green sapling bark round the
trunks. Pour a solution of arsenate of lead
inside the bark occasionally to kill insect
pests —J.G.
1621. —Each step should be 12in. wide
and 9in. deep. Calculate how many steps
are needed and lay out the foundation 12in.
in width to every 9in. of height. With 9in.
straight smooth boards construct a mould
of the foundation dimensions. Level it in
position and fill with concrete. On top build
a second mould 9in. less in width from* the
front and again fill in. So on to the upper-
most step. When fairly solid, before the
construction has dried, with a lioating trowel
smooth over the whole with a layer of pure
cement. —“Pick.”
1475. —Silicate of soda increases the re-
sistance of concrete to wear and tear through
hardening and densifying. The ordinary
water-glass of commerce will do. It should
be mixed with four times its volume of
water. The surface must be clean, free from
grease and dust and comparatively dry. The
concrete should be well watered with the
diluted silicate and a soft brush or mop used
to spread the solution evenly over the sur-
face, care being taken to keep the concrete
wet long enough to ensure penetration. The
concrete should be allowed to dry for 24
hours, and the process repeated. A third
treatment should be given in the same way.
The quantity required varies slightly accord-
ing to the porosity of the concrete. Usually
lewt. of P. 84 silicate is sufficient for the
complete treatment of 300 square yards.—
G.A.M.
1581. —Two blocks and a length of strong
wire rope should figure in the kit of every
touring car. When bogged, fasten one block
with straps to a fence, tree or stake and
attach the other to front axle. Carry the
rope through the blocks as is done for haul-
age. A yard from the end of a rail or
sapling lever tie the loose end of the rope.
Half-hitch the lever eqd to the outside line
of rope and push forward with the long
end. —“Rotom.”
1581. —Two winches for extricating motor-
cars from bogs are made in Australia, the
“Comet” and the “Southern Cross.” The
“Comet,” with a two-piece handle. 50ft.
of Jin.-wire rope on barrel of winch, and
25ft. in the coil, weighs 281 b.. costs £6.
and is obtainable from S'dney Williams and
Co., Ltd., Dulwich Hill, Sydney. The
“Southern Cross,” which has 70ft. of steel
cable fitted to the drum with an extra
coil, weighs 3241 b., costs £5 155.. and is
obtainable from the Southern Cross Windmill
Co., Campbell-street, St. Peters, Sydney.
Anyone who is familiar with wire-strainers
will understand how both are worked. —

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
McSliortodds will recall the first day of
the V.A.T.C. Spring meeting with satis-
faction, the Caulfield Guineas especially.
Although Avant Courier’s previous two
starts had produced a first and a third,
neither performance suggested that Yalicare’s
brother would credit E. M. Pearce with one
of this season’s classics, and in the betting
on the Guineas (the 40tli, by the way) he
was always at double-figure odds. The Wen-
sum, who had scored brilliantly at Fleming-
ton, was a warm favorite at 7 to 4; the
A..T.C. Derby winner Trivalve, who looked
a picture of condition, was at 9 to 4, Chariot
at 8 to 1, Avant Courier and Farrago at 12
to 1. Avant Courier jumped to the front
when the gate lifted, and along the back of
the course was a length ahead of Columban,
Farrago being next. “He’ll come back to
’em,” said the crowd, but he didn’t; still
first at the home turn, he drew right aw r ay
in the straight and won, full of running, by
2i lengths from the fast-finishing Trivalve,
w-ho was a long way back in the early part;
Farrago was a length and a half further
back, and The Wensum fourth. The favorite
looked dangerous coming into the straight,
but faded like a non-stayer. It was a most
impressive performance on the part of Yali-
care’s brother, and the crowd was sports-
manlike enough, despite his long price, to
recognise it. Much of the applause was for
the owner, who gave 5500 guineas for the
colt,. and whose colors are always popular.
Trained by Fred Foul sham, Avant Courier
was ridden by Jacky Daniels. Ilis time,
lmin. 39fsec., is a record for the race.
It was certainly E. M. Pearce’s lucky day,
for his speedy Mollison, Molly Robe’s gelded
son, ran away with the Debutant Stakes just
as he had done with his division of the
Maribyrnong Trial Stakes the previous Satur-
day. The books opened at 7 to 4 the field,
but they required 5 to 4 Mollison before they
ceased operations. The favorite went to the
front approaching the home turn, and thence-
forward there was only one in it; The Cad
(12 to 1) and Clarion Call (12 to 1) were
in the minor places, with daylight between.
Despite his 101 b. penalty, Mollison covered
the half-mile in 48sec.
It was hoped that Sol Green would start
Gothic in the Caulfield Stakes, but the
English horse was scratched. The race
proved another exercise gallop for Royal
Charter, who was always at odds-on, the
books demanding 5 to 2 before they closed
their volumes. Affirm, who is second favorite
for the Caulfield Cup, had some support at
7 to 1 ; Phonic (12 to 1), Thracian (15 to
1) and Finsbury (the same) were the others
inquired for. Piastoon was the early leader,
but Thracian ran to the front down the rail-
way stretch, and led past the half-mile post
from Piastoon, Royal Charter. Phonic and
Killara. Entering the straight Royal Charter
ran to the front with no perceptible
effort, and the consistent Comedy King horse
won on the bit; two lengths separated him
from Thracian, Affirm being another half a
length away and Finsbury a close fourth.
Royal Charter, who is sure to start a very
hot favorite for the Caulfield Cup, carried
the same weight—9st. lib. —as he will have
in the big 12-fnrlong affair, but Thracian
will drop from 9st. to Bst. 51b. and Affirm
from list. lib. to 7st. 101 b. Ridden, as usual,
by Duncan, the favorite covered the nine
furlongs in lmin. 54sec.
* * * *
Vaals had a 101 b. penalty, and his rider
drew a bad barrier position; nevertheless,
backers, with few exceptions, would have
nothing else for the Toorak Handicap. The
best price offered was 7 to 4. Hawick (5 to
1), Beauhania (8 to 1), Homerus (10 to 1),
Mutcha, Textile and Seventh Heaven (14 to
1) were the others inquired for. Seventh
Heaven, making his second appearance for
the day (he had beaten everything bar Nos-
citur jn the 1010 Welter), was in charge at
the half-mile post, Rubus, Vaals, Beauhania,
Metellus, Mutcha and Hawick following him ;
and in much the same order they turned into
the straight. Inside the distance, however,
Textile came with a victorious run which
landed him three parts of a length ahead of
Beauhania, Vaals being a close third; Rubus,
an early winner, was fourth. Textile, who
is by Green Seal —Bradford Lass, is a very-
smart horse on his day, but his form had
been indifferent lately, and his success was
not relished by the flatites. He is owned by
C. G. Brown and trained by E. J. O’Dwyer,
and Scanlon rode hifti. The time was lmin.
39-Jsec. —another race record.
There is no Manfred or Poseidon in the
Caulfield Cup this year. The topweight (and
warm favorite) is Royal Charter, who was
third to Manfred last year at a difference
of 91b. His recent successes have been
meritorious, but they have been all achieved
in w.f.a. races; and it is much harder to
win big handicaps, as Limerick has twice
found. All going well Royal Charter will
see a very short price, and it might be more
profitable to back a lightweight with good
ONE FOR HIS NOB.
“’Ere, you said you’d go easy!”
“’Strath, yes; but I forgot it was you—I just sighted me landlord in the crowd.”
credentials “both ways.” One that appeals
is Cairncross (6st. 131 b.), a four-year-old
gelding by Woorak —Southern Cross, who
has won over the distance and has recent
form to recommend him. Another thing in
his favor'is that he is trained by the accom-
plished Elwood Fisher. Bombard (7st.
Sib.), Beedos (7st. 91b.) and Valamita’s
half-brother Finsbury (7st. 101 b.) also have
claims, and Bard of Avon (Bst. 41b.) has a
knack of bobbing up in rich handicaps. In
an effort to place them this Page will go for
Cairncross, 1; Bombard, 2 ; Royal Charter, 3.
“Timsou”: The Y.A.T.C. still has three
of its original committeemen alive and spark-
ling—Arthur Wilson, Andrew Chirnside and
James Grice. Grice has been chairman for
14 years, and at 81 retains a gaiety of spirit
that many a man half his age might envy.
Up to a few years ago the veteran rode
regularly to hounds as a member of the
Melbourne Hunt Club. His youngest son,
Claude, is the expert amateur horseman who
piloted home Fleetstone in the Onkaparifiga
Steeple and the V.R.C. Grand National
Steeple in 1924.
* * * *
When Limerick was beating Amounis,
Commendation and co. at w.f.a. he was has-
tily proclaimed “the greatest horse ever seen
in Australia.” Now that he has met his
master the absurd description will be kept
in cold storage till next season, perhaps. In
the Randwick Plate on Saturday Pantheon
(7 to 4) made all the running and fairly
outstayed the Maoriland gelding, who was
in receipt of 91b. The race was run at a
solid pace, the two miles being traversed in
3min. 2S|sec., so there was no semblance of
a fluke about it. Perhaps Limerick was a
bit weary after his exertions in the Metrop.,
but he is far from being Windbag’s equal at
two miles. Pike’s riding of Pantheon was
worthy of the greatest of present-day Aus-
tralian horsemen. McCarten. though a good
jockey, is not in Pike’s class.
Winalot moved a bit scratcliily when do-
ing his preliminary for the Clibborn Stakes
(be was favorite at 6 to 4), and he failed
to get a place, Sacedon (20 to 1) winning
from Merry Mint (10 to 1) and Prime Don
(7 to 1). In the Members’ Handicap on
the Wednesday, Prime Don had come in
first and Sacedon third. Winalot, Trivalve
and Merry Mint were the best of the tliree-
year-olds over the Derby distance at Rand-
wick, and there m not much between them.
All the same, this Page would not be sur-
prised to see the gigantic Glenariff giving
them trouble about St. Leger time or a bit
later. There are possibilities in this fellow,
although he is an awkward customer at
present.
Amusement, who was backed to beat
Rampion and Limerick in the Hobartvilla
Stakes at Warwick Farm last season but
lost form subsequently, came to light at the
meeting as a handicap horse with staying
ability above the average. He won two
good races —the Waverley Handicap, 14 fur-
longs, in 3min., on Saturday—and was inter-
fered with in the Sydney Handicap on Wed-
nesday when going well. That race was won
by Tangible, a brother to Lilypond and a
Melbourne Cup possibility if he goes oyer.
Amusement, who is a brother to Sum King,
is not in the Melbourne Cup.
* * * *
Ramulus, a brother to Rampion, was the
best two-year-old produced at 'the meeting.
Like Rampion, he is owned and was bred by
the Briens. Wliitta showed out well among
the sprinters and Wedding Eve among the
middle-distance horses. The rain on Metrop.
day prevented the club making its customary
big profit, but there was a splendid attend-
ance on the last day.

For the City Tatt.’s meeting at Randwick
on Saturday-
Flying Handicap: White Fang, 1; Arie-
don, 2; Whitta, 3.
Novice Handicap : Lauder, 1; Goshawk, 2.

“Throat Strap” : Things have changed on
the Randwick Flat. A decade or two
ago a shilling in another man’s hand was
looked upon by many Flat frequenters as a
personal affront, and many were the devices
to relieve him of it. Conspicuous among them
was the “Yankee sweat,” a bonny little wheel
affair with a break that would stop a train.
Then there was the two-up school, where
“nobs” and “greys” were always in evidence
The shell-and-pea game was profitable also—
to the shell-and-pea man. He could shift
your ballast as easily as the finger of a Potts
Point belle slides into an engagement-ring.
The man with the fins and deuces (for
hazard), the chap with the sovereign and
purse, the three-card artist—all combined to
circumvent the geese with the golden eggs.
And they always showed a profit on the
day.
❖ :|c * *
“Eagle Farm”: Though Merry Mint, the
Maoriland candidate for the A.J.C. Derby,
disappointed his admirers in the classic,
owners from the other side of the Tasman
have had a fair run of luck in the Randwick
event. Bonnie Scotland annexed it as long
ago as 1894, but there was a long wait till
G. G. Stead saw Noctuiform win in 1905.
Then came Kilboy in 1910, and in the two
following years Biplane and Gloaming got
away with the blue ribbon for G. D. Green-
wood. The latter won again in 1921 with
Cunidon. and Ballymena scored in 1924.
Since then, Nigger Minstrel’s second to
Heroic and Limerick’s second to Rampion
last year have been the best performances to
date.
* * * *
The South Aus. Derby, run at Morphett-
ville on Saturday, was won by A. van
Anton’s Marco Polo, a bay gelding by Lord
MarcO—Snowslioe; he beat Some Quality by
a short head, with Alfred the Great third.
Marco Polo and Some Quality have now met
three times in Adelaide “classics,” the geld-
ing scoring two to the filly’s one. though
there seems little between them. The time,
2m. 36sec., equals the record for the race
put up by Stage Girl in 1918. Some Quality
was favorite. A protest alleging interference
was not sustained.
* * *
The Queensland Guineas, run at Ascot on
Saturday, was won by High Syce, a chest-
nut colt by Highfield (imp.) from Concise by
Syce (imp.). Great interest was taken in
the meeting of the winner and Stripling,
his rival as a two-year-old; it was the first
encounter of the pair this season High Syce
won six two-year-old events last year, and
has furnished into a good three-year-old at
the Guineas distance, a mile. Whether he
will stay is another matter.
* * * #
“Hotham”: Imported Cyklon has made
a good start this season. Three of his
youngsters have done well, the first being
Mistral, winner of the Dequetteville Stakes,
the initial race for two-year-old fillies in
South Australia. Another daughter, Belle
Gallante, scored in the A.J.C. Gimcrack
Stakes, and Trivalve’s success in the A.J.C.
Derby completed a useful treble. Cyklon is
a travelled beast, having raced in England
and Germany before emigrating to Australia.
❖ ❖ ❖
“Ike McBagg”: The lady bookmaker is
something new in Australia, except in the
pettier s.p. shops, where a few carry on
business in Sydney and Melbourne under
the guise of greengrocers, swec-tsellers and
the like. The first of the sex in the writer’s
experience to come out in the open—or
nestle coyly under the rose—was fined 25
of the best the other day in Auckland for
betting at Ellerslie racecourse. In Maoriland,
the profession is not supposed to exist, but
every racecourse is thronged with surrep-
titious Tommies, and now Tliomasina has
joined the band. The lady acknowledged
that she had been layin’ ’em for 18 months.
❖ * $
“Ace-Trey”: It was just on closing time
when the plain-clothes constable entered
Spadger’s betting-shop and bought a packet
of cigarettes. “Any chance of having a
flutter on the handicap at Randwick to-
morrow?” he asked. “Oh, yes,” said Spad-
ger. “It’s a pretty crook field, but I can
bet you sixes bar. two if it’s any good to
you.” From his pocket the constable took
a marked pound-note. “Which two are you
barring?” he questioned. “You and your
sergeant,” said Spadger. “So long!”
* * * *
“Coot” : The inventor of the first totalisator
proper used in Australia was Robert Wool-
ford, still alive at Elsternwick (Vic.), aged
81. The S.A.J.C. originally had a French
pari-mutuel machine. This was unsatisfac-
tory, and Woolford was asked by the club’s
secretary to try to improve on it. As a
result he invented a tote which was satis-
factory in every way. He patented the “Infal-
lible Record Totalisator,” and two of his
machines were in use at Morphettville up to
about six years ago, when they were super-
seded by electrically-worked contrivances. The
two cost about £700, exclusive of buildings.

The toshy ball or blocks the straight,
While oldsters, gathered into packs
The prospects of their club debate
And argue whether or no their State
The Sheffield Shield will bear away
And fervently ejaculate:

We’ve batsmen, stalwart souls in stacks,
Eager new records to create;
And ’keepers, lads of wire and wax,
Behind the sticks who crouching wait;

Deft slips, a glittering array,
But ne’er a trundler really great.

The googlie aye shall take its tax
And wipe the rabbits off the slate;

The lesser lights annihilate;

THERE are two ways of doing
* jobs such as trench-digging,
road-making and loading: the old
cortly way of employing picks and shovels and
the economical way of using modern machinery.
In King “Tut’s” time, the primitive pick and
shovel was right enough, but the old methods
are as dead as those times are. These are days
of strenuous competition —if you would survive
you must do this class of work the new way—
the “Barber-Greene” way.
The Barber-Greene Ditcher.
The saving in trench excavation by using a
Barber-Greene Ditcher as compared with hand
labor is approximately 2/- to 3/6 per cubic
yard.
The Barber-Greene Loader
on a certain class of work has done a much
greater output than 40 men shovelling. It will
pay for itself many times over in the saving it
effects, lording Broken Stone, Sand, Gravel,
Scarified Road Materials. Coal, Clay, etc.
Portable Conveyors.
For loading or conveying loose materials from
pits, stock piles, etc., they may be fed by
hand or by bucket loaders.
We manufacture some of these
machines in our own works in
Australia under license to the
Barber-Greene Company.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Maorilander Charlie Purdy and Yankee
Jack Pilkington inaugurated the Friday-night
experiment at the Sydney Stadium last week.
There was an exceptionally large crowd —at
the rival show in Leichhardt. Purdy’s clever
evasion, his swift weaving in and out, and
his scientific blocking of Pilkington’s swings
and hooks were enjoyed by the cognoscenti,
while the bloodthirsty push on the terraces
roared approval of the American’s smash-in
tactics. Good wallops to mouth and eyes
had Charles blpeding, but he took everything
that came along without flinching. At the
close referee Wallis thought it was Pilking-
ton’s turn and crowned him accordingly.
There was really very little margin; but,
like Mercutio’s wound, it sufficed.
* :K * *
“Grab and Grip”: “Mitt-Shover” (B.
6/10/’27) was mistaken in stating that Tom
Heeney “cruised around Sydney and Mel-
bourne some years ago begging vainly for a
Stadium engagement.” As a fact, the big
chap got an engagement at Sydney Stadium
a few weeks after he landed here in 1924.
But he and his opponent made such a miser-
able showing that the management reckoned
it useless to persevere with him. Its view
was that Tom was an ungainly novice who
wouldn’t have drawn sevenpence.
* * * *
“Tom Cribb”: Teddy Baldock, England's
hope for the world’s bantamweight title, has
gone the way which most of the old country's
pugilistic aspirants tread nowadays.. After
beating one Archie Bell, an American, he
was acclaimed a wonder, and a match for
the world’s championship with Taylor—
another American, of course—was practi-
cally fixed up. But the other night, at Lon-
Albert Hall, Edward was licked by
Willie Smith, of South Africa, and Willie
is now to take Teddy’s place in the pro-
jected clash with Mr. Taylor. Australians
who have seen Smith in action were not
astonislied at the result. He is an exception-
ally good man.
* * # *
“Cauliflower”: It bleeds me ’cart, as Bill
the Geyser useter say, t’ ’ear poor ole Jack
Johnson’s down-an’-out. It says in th’ papers
’e’s gone bung, not bein’ able t’ pay up a
chaser on four thousan’ quid worth uv jool-
ery. W’en I was rubbin’ Jack down ’ere
in Kidney Pie ’e thort nuthin’ was too good
fer me; an’ ’ees missus, a fine big w’ite
’eifer, ergrees with ’im. Says ’ees nibs w’en
’e was leavin’: “If y’ ever comes t’ Gahd’s
country ’ike t’ me at once. If I’m not ’andy,
arsk fer the missus.” Well, the game got
blown to a bubblte ’ere, and I did a duck
ercross, peelin’ spuds an’ doin’ w’atever a
cow with big boots on tole me. I ’ad ernough
planted in me belt t’ get through, an’ then
I goes for Jack’s place—’e was trainin’ fer
Jeffries then. They wouldn’t let me inter
the camp, so I gets the address uv the
missus, an’ oofs it orf there, thinkin’ I was
’ome-an’-dried. It was. a bonzer ’ouse, an’ I
sends in me message with a reminder uv the
ole days an’ the promises. The lady comes
out an’ gives me the wunce over. “Imperti-
nence !” she says. “I never saw the dirty
’obo before in me Gahdam life.” Too right,
she ’adn’t! Y’ see, it was a different missus.
# * He *
The cheering sight of , a packed house
greeted Kilonis and Edwards as they made
their way into the Melb. Stadium ring on
Saturday night. As a wrestling match the
affair was a farce, but as a burlesque (and
that was what the crowd came to see) it
was tolerable for a time. In the first act the
interesting pair introduced a new feature by
paying a lot of attention to the .ears. Press-
men and referee were involved in one melee,
and the Greek issued bloodthirsty threats
while Bill foamed at the mouth. In the
second John brought the house down by
dragging the Canadian out of the ring by
the nose. Once outside, they fought their
way far into the crowd, and when they
arrived back in the ring the bell had finished
the round. But that didn’t worry, the gentle-
men ; they kept up their pommelling until a
threatening move by the . police sent them
to their coimers. When things had quietened
down Bridges announced that he had
awarded a penalty fall to Edwards.. The
third and fourth acts were not quite so
diverting, but in the fifth the Greek was
given a penalty fall,, having received a
Canadian knee in the mid-region. After that
it became dull, and long before the referee
had crowned John —-“the winner, on points,
gentlemen”—manv fed-up persons had gone
home. The winner’s price was 3 to 1 on.
The Ins and Outs
“Hotliam”: The Victorian cricket season
was opened with fireworks on Saturday,
when Ponsford and Ryder both made cen-
turies. Ryder’s 175 for Collingwood against
Carlton was banged up in his usual care-
free style. St. Kilda got the benefit of Pons-
ford's 1S8—a masterly effort —and the Pra-
han bowlers suffered.
* * * *
“Mid-off” : Gordon Arnos, of Marrickville,
who was tried for N. S. Wales against
Queensland in Brisbane last season, is play-
ing in that capital this year and lias staittd
excellently. His fast-medium stuff may Jnake
him a rival of A. D. Mayes for the Sheffield
Shield games; he has a nice, easy action and
can swing ’em to some purpose, hor lar-
rickville last season he took 33 wickets for
an average of 20.42.
* * * *
“Rabbit”: The N.S.W. cricket authori-
ties are still in a quandary as to where to
find anew fast bowler. Nicholls, ot the
Cumberland district _ club, was tried m a
Possibles v. Probables match last year, but
did not fulfil expectations, taking only 1
wicket for 40. He hurt himself after that,
and dropped out of notice, but lias re-ap-
peared this season and is, apparently, m
greatly improved fettle. A big and powerful
young fellow, he has a rare opportunity it
the material is there.
* * * *
Some good batting performances marked
the second day of Sydney grade cricket. J.
Foskett, of Glebe, who has turned out several
times for the State, topscored with an
attractive 121 against Western Suburbs,
while young Archie Jackson, who has a
fancy for scoring heavily in the second
knock of a match, came along with a bright
110 for Balmain against North Sydney,
after failing in the first innings. His tally
included one 6 and 13 4’s, and took two
hours to get. Alan Kippax played a charac-
teristic knock for 107 for Waverley against
Randwick. Among the bowlers, R. Bubb,
of Manly, took 6 Cumberland wickets for
4<> including the hat-trick —three consecu-
tive balls hit the middle peg. For Balmain,
Arthur Mailey came to light again with 6
for 46 against North Sydney. Another good
performance was Ossie Asher’s 5 for 28 for
Paddington against University.
* * * *
“Splice”: H. S. Love’s return to Sydney,
after several seasons in Victoria, has its
interesting aspects. Love played for N.S.W.
as batsman and wicket-keeper, and, going to
Melbourne, appeared in the same capacity
in the Victorian XI, though over there
his place was more often in the longfield.
while Ellis attended to the sticks. He is
now playing with Mosman, and is already
showing such good form with the bat as to
suggest him as a serious candidate for the
Ma State team once more. Andy Ratcliffe,
a good ’keeper and a high-class left-hand
batsman, is also in the running, and then
there is the incomparable “Barney” Old-
field, who, of course, must have precedence.
The State team may thus include three top-
notch stumpers, two of whom are opening
batsmen; this should be something like a
record if it comes off. Both Ratcliffe and
Love are capital fieldsmen away from the
wicket.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury”: The cable informed us re-
cently that Kilner, Dolphin and Leyland, all
of Yorkshire, and Brown, of Hampshire,
will all be “guests of the Maharajah of Pati-
ala this winter for the purpose of popu-
CERTIFIED INSANE.

larising cricket in India.” Which means
that the four pros, will have a lordly time
and draw fat fees for coaching a few native
players in the capital of the Punjab poten-
tate. Time was when such giants of the
game as George Ulyett were willing to accept
a half-crown tip from an admirer, or a pint
of beer from one of lesser degree, after a
big hit or a lively innings, and think no
shame of it. What one of the Maharajah’s
guests would do if offered a pint of “Tad-
caster” by a bemused barracker is beyond
the writer’s imagination.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cash Amateur”: The Australian L.T.A.
has resolved to ask the International L. T.
Federation to alter a rule as to the legality
of an amateur player lending his or her name
to be used as a trade-mark for tennis requi-
ITS ANCESTRY.
FLAP: “My boy gave me this necklace; it’s
an heirloom.”
FLIP: “You mean a tin-hare-loom.”
sites. The present rule does not permit a
player to do this unless he is “the actual
manufacturer or retailer.” The Australian
body wants this last proviso cut out. The
change, if made, will vitally affect the status
of leading players who have been godfathers
to different brands of fashionable racquets
and other tennis gear. These will either
have to drop the lucrative practice or consent
to be ranked as professionals. The pro-
posal will certainly meet with furious oppo-
sition from the N.S.W. authorities, who. hold
different views on the question of what con-
stitutes professionalism from those professed
by the arch-enemy across the Murray.
* * * *
“Baseline”: Gerald Patterson’s illness in
Brisbane at the time of the Queensland
championships was more serious than most
people supposed. His doctor has interdicted
liis playing in the big Sydney tennis meeting
at the end of the month. However, the big
fellow hopes to be fit and well again by the
time the Frenchmen arrive.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: Now that the heads have
decided to risk a team for the next Davis
Cup, arrangements ought to be. made to
ensure regular and capable coaching. The
,Cup team is sure to be a young one, and
the advice of a skilful veteran must tend to
improve the best of them. Clearly the choice
should fall on J. O. Anderson, still one of
the world’s front-rankers; in fact, there
is no one else in sight. Another . matter
worth consideration is that of keeping the
team, once selected, to liard-court games.
Most Australian players are used to these,
hut change from hard- to grass-courts and
back again, which doesn’t make for consis-
tency'* * * *
“Double Strung”: Wallace Myers’s rank-
ing-list of the world’s best lawn-tennis
players consists of Lacoste, Tilden, Cochet,
Borotra, Alonzo, Hunter, Lott, Hennessy,
Brugnon and Kozeluh. Four Frenchmen,
four Americans, a Spaniard and a Czecho-Slav.
The compiler, as he explains, excludes Aus-
tralians, not because their skill is ques-
tioned, but because they have . not been
appearing in international tennis, though
he feels sure Australian players of both
sexes will figure prominently in Europe in
1928. He is dumb on the subject of the
omission of his fellow-countrymen from the
list, but that is probably just his dashed
politeness.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: In spite of the widespread
belief that Jack Crawford would be all the
better for a spell in the paddock, the young
man goes on diving into the game without a
stop. Since returning from a long country
tour, he has been figuring in the Sydney
championships and he is to play several
exhibition matches with J. O. Anderson in
Sydney at the end of the month As. he
will have plenty of additional tennis against
the Victorian visitors who will he over then
for the special tourney at the White City, it
is evident that the rest cure idea is not
receiving much attention from the young man
himself or the N.S.W. tennis authorities.
With the Frenchmen in the offing, this seems
neither good sense nor sane management,
looked at from the most material point of
view.
The Nineteenth Hole
The N.S.W. country golf championship,
played in Sydney last week, was won by 1>.
Coonan, once of Moore Park but now ot
Goulburn. The winner, who was runner-up
last year, returned a card of 76, three up
on H. M. Crecr and W. C. Paton, of New-
castle. The district match was . won by
Newcastle, which beat Western Districts 7
matches to 2; the Westerners won from
Newcastle last year.
* * * *
“Claypan”: Five years ago there were
only seven golf clubs in Queensland, l o-day
there are over 50, besides links on stations
and in minor townships which can hardly be
placed in the category of clubs. The Queens-
land flair for the game is easy to under-
stand. The State is almost the last remain-
ing sanctuary of the bullock-driver, and
cherishes his colloquial traditions.
* * * *
“Rocklea” : What must have been a minor
golf record took place in Brisbane the other
day, when two club-mates were competing
in a handicap. The pair had handicaps of
11 and 18 respectively, so it is easy to
imagine that their game is not one of cola,
machine-lik- steadiness and accuracy, Vet,
after tieing with 143 each on the round,
they did the same thing three times while
attempting to play off. At last one of them
must have wilted or struck some vile patch
of bad luck in the fifth try, for his opponent
bolted and ran out a winner by 10 up. The
odds against such a happening are a bit
longer than anything in evidence at the
A.J.C. Spring meeting.
* * * *
“Alluvial”: Someone connected with the
Melbourne municipal golf links at Fleming-
ton was struck by the number of small boys
offering second-hand golf balls for sale. With
complaints of stolen balls in liis mind lie did
some detective-work, only to find that the
source of supply was genuine. There is a
muddy creek running through the links in
which many a cherished pill has vanished.
The kids formed a syndicate, and on Sundays
prospected the creek, the average being about
50 balls a day. Steps were taken to have
the creek cleaned up, and the yield to date
is over 900 balls.
* * * *
“Gutty”: Golf, like billiards, shows signs
of dividing' itself into two separate kingdoms,
one inhabited by the supermen of the game,
like the leading professionals and such
amateurs as Bobby Jones, and the other by
people who are just golfers. This is particu-
larly evident in the battle now raging over
the desirability of adopting a lighter and,
perhaps, larger ball with which even the
cracks will not be able to get the. tremendous
length that they achieve with the small and
lively ball in use at present. Golf courses
cannot be lengthened indefinitely, and on the
longest holes now a good player usually
needs only a drive and a pitch shot to reach
the green. The second “wood” shot with the
brassie, one of the most attractive features
of the game, is being eliminated, and the
game is becoming stereotyped. On the other
hand, the generality of golf players find
it hard enough to do a decent round with
the most up-to-date type of ball, and will
object vehemently to any change which will
tend to make the game harder. The result
may be that a special type, of ball will he
evolved for the big tourneys m winch the
gods of golf go up against each other, while
the rank and file can continue to hammer
its wav round 19 holes with every assist-
ance that the present variety of pill can
afford it.
* * * *
“Mid Iron”: The Australian golf autho-
rities are vexed with doubts as to the
propriety of their action in declaring
the national foursomes off because two
competitors tangled up the result by play-
ing with their opponents’ ball. They have
referred the whole business to the com-
mittee of the Royal and Ancient elub
at St. Andrews for final decision. J he
sensible thing to do would be to lay down
a rule that players in important matches
must use balls with a distinguishing mark.
A golf ball need not necessarily be white —
in winter games in Britain years ago it was
the custom to use a bright .scarlet pill
which could easily be distinguished it it got
on to snow. Many makers mark their pro-
duct with colored dots to distinguish the
grades. There is nothing but. hidebound
conservatism to prevent balls being marked
with colored rings, or something of the sort.
That done, incidents like the calling-off of
the foursomes and the disqualification, ot
Miss Mona McLeod in the Vic. champion-
ship would not be repeated.

with the new Model 56 WINCHESTER Bolt-action, .22 calibre rifle,
because all the refinements of the 1 ghest-grade special target arms are
built into its barrel and action. The "'a--n-.ii e ■ men is mrrrd in shape and of
entirely new design, brings each of its five .22 Long-Rifle cartridges exactly into line with the
breech when the bolt is pulled back. Double Extractors grip the rim of the shell as it rises from
the magazine, and holding it firmly feed it in a perfectly straight line into the close-fitting
chamber.
When the breech is closed the Bullet, is seated right into the grooves of the rifling, ready to
take its spinning flight the instant the trigger is pressed. This means that there is no pre
liminary “jump” as it leaves the mouth ot me shea, and the core being completely sealed, every
ounce of pressure is exerted against the base of the, bullet. The result is superb accuracy, and
the full energy of the particular cartridge used.

Car and Cycle
“Sprocket”: A great push-bike feat was
that of Hubert Opperman, the Victorian pro-
fessional rider, last week, when he broke the
world’s record for an unpaced 24-hour ride.
The route taken was from Mt. Gambier
(S.A.) to Melbourne, and Opperman piled
up 416 miles in the time. The previous
world’s, best was 3971 miles, put up by M.
G. Selbach in England in 1922; while Ed
Pearson’s amateur and Australian record of
3061 miles fades into the background by
comparison. Opperman also established new
world’s figures for the 12 hours, covering
218.8 miles, as against Selbach’s previous
best of 205 miles. Two rests only were
taken on the trip : one of three minutes at
Colac and a 20-minute spell at Geelong.
* * * *
“Trembler”: A good workaday transcon-
tinental run of the kind that appeals to the
average motorist has been accomplished by
Percy Armstrong, of Perth, and his son.
The trip was from Perth to Sydney, and the
car a standard Erskine roadster. No
attempt was made to speed, and the average
running rate between the starting aud
finishing points was 21 m.p.h. There were
no punctures, and no repairs or adjustments
had to be made on the journey, nor were
any necessary when the car arrived in
Sydney. The distance from Perth to Sydney,
3096 miles, was covered in 10 days 14 hours.
* * * sis
“Differential” : Richard Benoist, most bril-
liant of French motor-drivers, has had a
pretty good season. In the last six months,
driving Delage cars, he has won the Grand
Prix in France, Spain and Italy. Last
week he annexed the British event, run at
Brooklands in wind and rain; the distance
was 327 miles in 125 laps, and his average
speed was 85.59 m.p.h. There were II
starters, two English and nine French.
* * * *
“ Jigger”: Two Victorians, McLellan and
Gordon, have set out to ride from Melbourne
to Darwin, via Adelaide, and back in a side-
car. With the two men and the equipment
carried, the cycle will be j)ulling 6cwt.,
which seems a pretty hefty haul for a vehicle
of this type over the country which will
have to be negotiated. If the outward
journey to Darwin is pulled off all right,
the return trip may be made by way of
Oodnadatta, Broken Ilill and northern Vic-
toria.
Miscellaneous
“Splash”: The recent stupid decision of
the Australian Swimming Union that Dick
Eve, Australia’s Olympic diver, must be
rated a professional because lie became
manager of a swimming bath may yet be
revised. In January the question will be
re-submitted to the Union meeting in
Sydney, and it is more than likely that the
rule, as it stands at present, will be altered.
Even in rigidly-amatcur Britain a man may
own, lease or manage baths and remain a
lilywliite, as long as he does not make money
by swimming or by teaching it. With Eve
able to go to Amsterdam, Australia's chance
of lifting a championship or two will be
improved.
* *:* * *
“Long Dog”: When Campbell, J., decided
in Sydney that the game of running dogs
round a circular course in pursuit of an arti-
ficial hare was on all fours with the sport
of pursuing live hares with greyhounds for
amusement or profit a sigh of relief went up
from the great heart of the nation—or so
much of it as goes to the dogs for petty bet-
ting, odds-laying, earbiting and urging, all
on the reduced scale. The heart of the specu-
lators in tin shares was also glad, and no
doubt “Judge” Swindell, who first wished
the hare on this country and got £20,000 for
doing it, received radio messages of congratu-
lation on the high seas. But the joy of “the
talent” was short-lived, for the Tin-liare
Government was licked on Saturday. And
they don’t know what the other crowd will
do.
* . * :!: «
“T’Boggart”: The tin-hare craze m
Britain has aroused the old controversy as
to whether the greyhound is speedier than
the thoroughbred horse. The fastest time
made by a hound at the new game is 28sec.
for 500 yards, at Manchester. The dog is
named Tall Oak. Horses don’t run that
distance, but Gloaming covered four fur-
longs in 45sec. On his time for the 500
yards, the hound travelled 440 in 24.64sec.,
which is not far behind Gloaming’s record
halved. All the same, if Gloaming were
back in the business there would be a ton
of money to say he could beat any dog
breathing in a furlong race, let alone two
furlongs.
• * * *
“Dead End” : The way of a man with a
maid is simplicity itself compared with the
way of a bowler with his standard bowl.
In his secret heart, the average bowler has
only one standard, and that is his own. Thus
it is that, after a visit to the testing table,
and the usual correction, the “wood” will be
later found to have reassumed its old eccen-
tricities, whether these lay in running
straight as a prad whose boy has been spoken
to by the “stipes” or in a curve that would
gladden the heart of Einstein. The Aus-
tralian bowling heads forced the adoption
of a standard method of testing bowls for all
States. After some months of anguish, the
South Aus. bowlers have instructed their
delegates to the Melbourne conference to get
the rule rescinded, if they can. I support
the South Aus. brotherhood. You can't
teach an old dog new tricks, and to wrest
from such the “woods” he loved and has lost
seems inhuman.
Mosman R. C.’s regatta on Saturday
marked the official opening of the 1927-28
rowing season in N.S.W. The show was
staged on the Lane Cove River, and the
feature of the day was the determined bid
made by Sydney to lower the colors of the
State champions in the Boone Memorial
Cup for senior eights. Mosman beat M. G.
Mackenzie's crew by three-quarters of a
length, after one of the best j aces seen on
the river for many a day. Ilaberfield, a
young club, did well, picking up the light
maiden and junior fours, besides acquiring
the Walker Ilall Cup through the agency
of sculler J. R. Scott.
“Loom”: After swearing it would ne’er
consent, the N.S.W. Rowing Association lias
consented to Bob Pearce competing in the
Olympic trial sculling-race on the Yarra.
Pearce is accompanying the Mosman eight,
which is to row for the Grand Challenge
Cup, and will have to pay his own expenses.
This is a bit over the odds. The people who
insist on seeing the champion in Melbourne
should certainly pay for the pleasure.
“Koolanga”: “R.E.” is very one-eyed in
his par. about swivel rowlocks (11. 6/10/'2T).
I have rowed in crews using swivels and in
crews using poppets, and I repeat that the
trouble with swivels is getting the hands and
blades away cleanly. Admittedly, Victoria
used swivels in its last inter-State win, but
has it had a crew in the same class since?
That eight would have won if it had raced
in a practice boat. Westralia has often used
swivels, but hasn’t had more than its share
of the honors. Anyhow. W.A.’s training and
coaching methods are far superior to those
of any other State. It takes men who are
rested and gives them five months’ prepara-
tion for a King’s Cup race, whereas the other
States, with their rowing season in the
summer, give overtrained men a few weeks
together. 'When Roger Fitzhardinge was
stroking the Sydney crews (it was the time
that club went for six years without a
defeat in senior or championship races)
swivels were tried on one occasion only; they
were scrapped because the men were never
sure of their catch and finish as when rowing
in fixed tholes. May I quote Guy Nickalls:
“Three of the best crews ever seen at Henley
(Eng.) were, perhaps, the Argonauts
J. McMAHON, the new chairman of the
AJ.C. stipendiary stewards, who took
over his duties at the close of the A.J.C.
Spring meeting.
(Canada) of 1913, and the Australians of
1912 and 1919. The Argonauts used swivels
at Henley but discarded them on their return
to Toronto. On their first trials with fixed
tholes they easily broke all former records
on their home course.”
“Toggle”: Tas. Chief Justice Nicholls, a
great oarsman of other days, told the Speck’s
R. A. at its annual meeting that modern row-
ing men were slackers in their training. In
recent regattas he had seen more than one
man in races little longer than a mile collapse
at the end. In the old days when three-
mile races were the usual thing, the man who
hadn’t wind enough to cheer the winning
crew at the end of the procession was passed
out. Which is as may be. The Oxford-Cam-
bridge boatrace crews are carefully selected
and trained to the minute, yet instances of
collapse in this lengthy event are common.
It is generally conceded nowadays that dis-
tances of three miles or over are far too
severe a task to set young men. In addi-

ing out of big tennis for a while, under

tion, the fast, short stroke which has suc-
ceeded the stately swing forward and thrust
back makes greater demands on stamina.
On top of all that, the modern man works
harder and faster than the majority of the
lads of earlier days, while employers do not
smile indulgently on requests to take time
off for training, as they used to do.
“C. Drew” : Although yacht-racing on Mel-
bourne’s Albert Park lake is still indulged
in weekly, the sport has shed its old-time
lustre. Time was when a fleet of 20 or 30
boats sported canvas for the week-end
flutter, but now a race of half a dozen
entrants is looked upon as quite, an event.
There are few privately-owned craft, the
majority of sailing men preferring to hire
boats for the occasion. Diehards aver that
the lake provides the champagne of sailing,
but it is hard to credit it. Four feet six
inches is the average depth, and in places
it shallows down to the depth of a stick
of type. Once the water got so low that
the boatslied proprietors were forced to
pull their craft up on the shore. There they
remained for 18 months.
“Ride Off”: The Mount Crawford club
(S.A.), which has, on performances, the
best polo team in the Commonwealth, has
been invited by the American Polo Associa-
tion to send a team to California. It has
had to decline, as there is insufficient time
to make the elaborate preparations neces-
sary. The A.P.A., however, has been asked
to renew the invitation next year.
The N.S.W. Rugby Union. Waratahs
gained their seventh consecutive victory in
Britain when they beat a combined Cum-
berland and Yorkshire side by 9 to 3 —two
tries and a penalty goal to a try. This was
their closest go yet, and the first time the
team has failed to register double figures.
The side was a rearranged one, Ben. Egan
playing on the wing, where he scored a try,
and Towers and King filling the centres,
while the forwards were also a fresh mixture.
The counties were outclassed, except in the
forward division, and the deadly tackling
of the Australian backs kept the tough oppo-
sition vanguard quiet. The mid-week game
against East Midlands was won by 16 to 12,
or four tries and two goals to two tries and
three penalty goals, after the home side
had led 9-5 at half-time. Here again the
English forwards provided a formidable
opposition, and the Australian back division,
which included Lawton in the centre and
Sheehan at five-eighth, had a difficulty in
settling down. That they did so. and scored
two to one in tries, is good evidence of their
capacity and steadiness. The Midlands beat
the Wallabies, and have always been tough
nuts to crack for visiting overseas sides.
* * :|s *
The N.S.W. Soccer season officially ended
on Saturday, when the South Coast club,
Balgownie. won the final of the Metropolitan
championship from Granville by 6 goals to
4. Gladesville-Ryde succumbed to Pyrmont-
South Sydney, which scored 3 goals to 2, in
the final of the Cronin Cup.
Business, Robbery., etc.
Geoffrey Rutter Glarke, son of A. Rutter
Clarke, has bought a seat on the Melbourne
Stock Exchange for £l6OO. This is the
highest price paid since 1890, when Bob
Harris, a son-in-law of Mark Moss, the finan-
cier, gave £2500 for a seat.
* * * *
“The Juice” : Seven gallons of oil from the
Roma (Q.) bore have been used to run motor-
cars without any refining. The same thing
had been done elsewhere, notably at Calgary
(Canada), where one well in particular pro-
duces a fine oil, high in petrol and benzine
content. The idea of drawing one’s fuel
direct from the natural Bowser, so to speak,
Avill irresistibly appeal to the Australian
motorist compelled to part up about 2s. a
gallon for the imported article.
:\t * *
“Henry James”: The David Jones co. is
making the window display in its new Syd-
ney store an all-Australian exhibition, mostly
the work of David Jones factories. Even
the mannequin figures are Australian in
formula, design, materials and workmanship.
The makers of these figures, after two years'
battling, are capturing the local market.
Mainly through the encouragement of David
Jones a thriving little industry has been
added to the Australian list.
* :j: * *
“All ’Ot”: Queensland, whatever else her
disabilities, has long enjoyed immunity from
the peanut terror which walks by night and
during matinees in the theatres and picture-
shows of less blessed States. The sale or
possession of peanuts in any condition in
amusement places was banned. But in
answer to the pleadings of the Peanut-
growers’ Association the authorities have
softened. Peanuts may now be sold or con-
sumed in theatres, but only in the nude —
the ban still lies on the enclosed variety.
“Borom” : The local demand for Australian
black opals is steady, but there is a better
market for them in America, where they
bring good prices. A Sydney man, on a
recent visit to ’Frisco, took a parcel of Light-
ning Ridge stones. They cost him £35, but
before he had been in California a week he
had sold one for £lO and two others for £7
each. In Los Angeles he sold the rest for
£75 to a dealer, who reckoned that he could
make a fair profit on his purchase, mostly
from the Hollywood people.
# * ❖ ❖
“Lao-dali”: A quaint aquatic creature is
the suction-dredge Sir William McPherson,
which exposed all of her unbeautiful but use-
ful form in dry dock at Williamstown (Vic.)
the other day. Two poles as tall as tele-
graph standards penetrate her transom.
When she is working one of these is lowered
and driven into the sand. The action of the
buckets slews her round to port or star-
board, when the other pole prods the ocean
floor, swinging her back again. Thus she
actually walks over the bottom much in the
manner of a crab.
* * * *
“Diorite”: Now that the Golden Mile is
petering out the golden fleece is doing some-
thing to keep Ivalgoorlie going. From
stations to the northward the wool clip
this year is estimated at over 15,000 bales
—last year’s clip was 3150 bales, but 40,000
sheep were railed there from S.A. after last
shearing. Another 17,000 head will shortly
be conveyed in four special trains from
Port Augusta to Ivalgoorlie. Incidentally,
W.A. now claims to have as many sheep as
S.A., and most of the increase may be found
in the old mining districts.
:!= * * *
“P.X.” : The experts have.been at it again
and have been calculating—in millions, of
course —what the recent rains were worth to
N. S. Wales. Of course, nobody knows
because nobody knowes how long the. drought
would have lasted if these particular rains
hadn’t come. Every time a fire-brigade puts
the water on a blaze in a nice combustible
city block it saves the whole block ; and in just
the same way rain saves every ear of corn
and hoof of stock. To say that a rain is
worth so many specified millions is there-
fore nonsense —whether it is one million or a
hundred millions depends wholly on whether
the rain, if it hadn’t come just now, came
a week hence or a year hence.
The share market, in Sydney particularly,
bucked up well after almost-general good
rains. A Bulletin man, who made a rapid
reconnaissance of the southern half of N. S.
Wales, reports that he found much less
drought country than he hhd expected from
current reports. Eastward of a line drawn
from Orange and dropped through Grenfell
and Young the crops, though they may not
be heavy, will be saved. Between Young
and Temora there will be some failures;
only westward of Temora in that belt are
there any large areas beyond recovery. A
fortnight more of dry conditions would have
ruined tens of thousands of acres more. On
the other hand the losses of sheep, especially
the early shorn, following the cold rain,
have been serious. Still, that is only a small
fly in a very fine pot of ointment.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
"SLIPPER HEEL"
HOSIERY
Hakes the Ankle Slimmer & Trimmer.
The A.J.C. week at Randwick finished up
with a fine augury for the flapper when
Wedding Eve and Lovebox ran first and
second in the Pinal. That übiquitous crea-
ture merited some reward on Saturday, for
she has never looked prettier. She dressed
the stands like a nice cool salad witii let-
tuce-greens, radish-pinks and tomato-reds.
Here and there red-currant crinolines,
banana-yellow pleatings and the pink of the
water-melon kept up the illusion of a vege-
tai’ian’s paradise. Very different was the
atmosphere from that of Wednesday, when
furs and kashas made their last formidable
stand of the season. Then the sigh of envy
was directed to the mixed grey squii'rel and
arctic fox and the grey felt millinery,
folded softly in the embrace of guinea-fowl
plumage, worn by Mrs. Sep. Levy, the wide
white felt of Lady Cowan, the sable cape
of Mrs. T. A. Field, and, in short, to the
woman who managed to be at once warm and
fashionable. Among the notable of these
were Janet Knox, iix a well-cut calfskin coat
topped by a wine-red velour hat; Susan
Spencer, whose white kasha suit was col-
lared in white fox; and Mrs. Pat Levy, who
wore her soft green felt pulled down to the
eyebrows. The State Vice-reine, too, showed
a glimpse of handsome peacock upholstery
under a sable coat; and popular J. O’Keeffe,
pursued by congratulations on her regained
health, smiled under a droopy hat of rose
beige crinoline wi’eathed by flat velvet roses
of exactly the same tone. Peifliaps because
of the spring sunshine of Saturday, the most
attractive were the week’s debs.: Betty
Willsallen in her skyey blues, and Ann Curtis
Bennett in white-frilled muslin. Radiant
under a cream felt and straw hat was Mar-
garet Osborne, while Mrs. Henry Hill
Osborne, in daffodil georgettes, lingered on
the eye. Mi’s. Harry Dransfield’s black
georgettes bloomed with bead flowers, a bride
of eleven o’clock made her appearance blue-
clad and -shod, and Priminister Bruce’s con-
sort was among the day’s best dressers.
Gold thread patterned the black marocain
worn by Colin Stephen’s lady: Mrs. John
Martin, whose ball was one of the week’s
bright lights, walked hatted and frockod in
mushroom pinks, and Mrs. Stafford, from
Cassilis, boasted a silver fox beyond price
and beyond suspicion.
Once again the Union Club decked itself
with red and white awning as a sign that the
vine had put forth its leaf, and that the mem-
bers were about to pay seasonal homage to
the ladies. The club lfises to its social re-
sponsibilities. to the fair sex once a year, and
though it might rather creak and groan in
the effort like middle-age suddenly aroused
from drowsing in an armchair, flowers and
music drown any protest the hoary old rooms
may make over the invasion. The great tea-
party was set for late afternoon, after the
races last week, and from the Bligh-street
entrance the clxib was heavy with arum-lilies
and palms, flowers massed in bowls or trailing
fimm hanging baskets. In the dining-room,
where nearly 500 were soon gathered, fragrant
dolls, their spreading crinolines woven of
flowers, posed upon the mantelpiece or stared
pensively through the plenty on the tea-
tables. The vice-regal board - boasted a tall
doll kirtled in delphiniums, baby roses and
heliotrope, and looped around with flowex-y
garlands. The little balcony off the dining-
room was sweet with wicker baskets in which
begonias and juicy shoots of sprinsr grew and
bloomed. The club’s Venetian glass shone
like a rajah’s ruby in the big smoking-room.
Fires glowed everywhere in this frigid
October (last year the guests at this party
sweltered), and there were some even among
Sydney’s very best who found time to look
at the good pictures on the walls. Half of
the contents of Randwick’s official stand
seemed to have emptied itself into the
premises, and the talk was racy in the
extreme. Club president Consett Stephen
and Shepheard Laidley murmured their wel-
comes, and were backed up by all the com-
mittee. The vice-regal party consisted of Sir
Dudley, his lady, the sub-lieutenant son and
Elaine.
Dinner and dance at the Rose Bay Golf
Club brought Race Week to a nicely mar-
celled end for most of younger and a hand-
ful of older Sydney. The ankle-length tulle
fx’ock, bouffant and frilled, had a great
vogue and was seen to advantage on Ailsa
Cullen in sea blues and greens, in the rosy
layers of Mrs. E. Brown’s frock and in the
blaek billows of Mrs. Noel Heath's tulle.
Colonel and Mrs. Bertram’s party included
Elaine de Chair and sailor-bi-other Graham,
Elaine in silver aixd green. Tall Cynthia
Hawkes got a good effect from the combina-
tion of violets and grey chifxons; Phil
McLachlan was decorative in white and
silver. Mrs. Geoffrey Hughes, escorted by
her captain, wms a flash of green and gold,
and Doreen Higgins wore her pleasant smile
above flame and silver.
Pretty and blonde before a background of
black and gold, Jeanette Etlielston sang her
farew'ell to Sydney like a fairy. The concert
wh (>li filled the Conservatoriunx with Queens-
landers —for the singer comes from the North
—was w'ell balanced betweexi operatic and
Russiaix songs. The soprano sings with a
silvery charm not to be resisted and her
enunciation is close to perfection.
The Mosman Golf Club spread itself for
its first big dance at the Wentworth last
week. Over 650 squeezed into the big ball-
room and the night was full of bumps for
him who wouldn’t or couldn’t heed the
muttered “fore” that pui'sued him to the
dance’s end. The success of the shivoo is
still the talk of the Mosman and Taronga
boats. Never had a golf course so many holes
as were numbered by the tables (66 of
them), and certainly no golf links have ever
blossomed more luxuriantly than the ball-
room, where the waxen pink of the aloof
camellia mingled witli the fragrant friexxd-
liness of the violet, while Nature’s entire
color scheme seemed to have been over-
hauled for the glowing and delicate luxes
sported iix the frocking. Lilac sparkling
with silver enfolded Mrs. R. S. Sands, whose
Colonel husband was one of the night’s secre-
taries ; Kathleen Armstrong, assistant scribe,
had splashed her blue georgettes with crystal.
The Archdale Parkhill couple bobbed up
among the night’s polychrome tapestry. All
the gems of Birmingham wei-e flung with
lavish baud over georgettes that varied in
hue from the noonday sky to the velvet black-
ness of a ti-opic night. Dresses were caped,
spreading and hooped, and many had appa-
rently been modelled on the lines beloved by
Alda, being short about the kneecap but
sweeping into length and fulness at the back.
The treasurer was E. B. Harkness, who with
Mx’S. Harkness presided at a table that
might have been called the better ’ole. Mrs.
Harkness kept to local color, and the teeing
box had inspired her graceful sand-colored
georgettes.
The pleasant-faced girl in this May Moore
picture is
Dorothy Ew-
bank, one of
Sydney’s top
branch song-
birds. Her
lyric soprano
is now known
all over the
State, as she
is one of the
most frequent
singers on the
air. As a con-
cert singer
much ’of her
charm lies in
sensitive in-
t e r p retation,
and sli e is
p a r t i cxxlarly
happy in her
rendering of
fo 1 k songs.
She and pian-
ist Frank Hutchens are dated for an end-of-
the year recital. - w / :
The glory of Canberra at the moment
isn’t tile new stucco Secretariat or even
Mr. Billy Hughes’s new Flint car, which
he is nobly teaching Dame Margaret to
drive; it is the wallflowers that are in their
greatest glory about the Hotel Canberra.
Here are xnore than the opulent old browns
running through all the tones to yellow;
Nature has dropped some of the bi'owns and
yellow's into a bath of red ovei’ixight. Along-
side the txilips are beginning to make a
show; but we can’t yet grow them as they
grow them in Canada, which nowadays pro-
duces a barrow-load for every single bloom
that Plolland can produce. The Government
is going to be asked to do all sorts of things
to save the members of Parliament, their
wives and their officials from being bored
to death; it might do worse than take a
leaf oxxt of the book of a girls’ school up
that way which sets apart a little garden
plot for each young miss to cultivate.
For the moment the motorist has ail the
best of it so long as he is. content to re-
main on the excellent tracks within the
Territory; lfet him go but a few hundred
yards out of it and he is liable to be shaken
to death oh., w'hat passes for a main road
to Quean beyan. the place w'here the bottle-
tree grows. Yet if you stay inside the
Territory—both Mr. and Mrs. Bruce are
among the well-seasoned dxivers, by the w'ay
—even the Cotter dam begins to get a little
tiresome after the 37th visit.
A blooming little deb. of the week was
Betty Willsallen. She had her very own
coming-out ball, given by her father and
mother at Retfoi'd Hall, the Tony Hordern
home at Darling Point. The conventional
white frock was discarded in favor of float-
ing green and silver. Another youngster,
Ann Curtis, under the wing of her mother,
Lady Curtis Bennet, made her first grown-
up bow at her friend’s dance. Iler white
geoi’gettes showed gold traceries. The dance
was one of the week’s smart affairs, and all
social Sydney, including their State Exes.,
were present.
Even Zanzibar has its main street. It
rejoices in the name of Ndia Kixn, and from
its beginning at the Sultan’s palace to its
grand finish at the castellated British agency
no one has a more intimate knowledge of the
thoroughfare than the subject of this May
Moore picture. She is the wife of Cyril Brooke-
Francis, Attor-
ney - General
in that Brit-
i s h P r o t e e-
torate, a n d
she is the
only Austra-
1i a n woman
among the 300
whites in the
Arab - built
capital. Th c
vivid red of
the acacia, the
blue of a har-
bo r smudged
with the grey
of visiting war-
ships and ani-
mated with
traffickin g
steamers an d
Arab dhows,
and the shim-
mering white
of flat-topned houses form the background
for the velvet-soft , daily round that flies oil
rickshaw-wheels between the Government
offices, the club and the Sultan’s
palace, j iftvery Saturday night the Sultan
lends his ; orchestra to the club, and
here, on a marvellously-polished teak flooi*,
everybody dances. Perhaps in between turns
someone more imaginative or psychic than
his fellows may give a thought to the memory
of the shuddersome slave-trafficker Tippoo
Tib, whose house next door is said to teem
with ghosts of walled-up slaves. Then, at
the end of the day or the beginning of
another, the toilers of Empire go home, and
the massive, carved ebony-black and brass-
bossed front doors of Zanzibar are bolted
for the night. Before she became Mrs.
Brooke-Francis, the lady was Mavis Robert-
son, grand-daugliter of “old Jock Robertson,”
a foi’mer N.S.W. Premier and a picturesque
contemporary of Henry Parkes.
Padre 11. D. Carter, of that unostenta-
tiously vigorous religious body known as the
Catholic Apolostic Church, gave his daughter
away one day last week in his own church
at Redfern. The bride, Janet, who looked
as jolly as Pippa must have when she
hymned the result of her research work oix
the Summer Motif to Robert Browning, was
claimed by Ian 1 Clunies-Ross. who had a
hit of the lark-on-the-wing look himself. A
pink cloxid cut into flounces and a picture
hat clothed the bride, while skyey blxxes were
worn in pleats by the two ’maids, Gwen
Ward and Marjorie Hardie. lan Clunies-
Ross is a lecturer in veterinary science at the
Uni. Young veterinarians in floating gowns,
dashing handfuls of wheat and corn and chaff
from upturned mortar-boards on the newly-
weds, were features of the precession from
the church steps to the cars; there were
more decorous rejoicings in the sanctity of
the Women’s Club, where the wedding-meats
were spread. This is the first occasion on
which the club has harbored a wedding
bi’eakfast, and here the bride’s mother, in
old-rose georgettes, was supported by Mrs.
Clxxnies-Ross, senior, who happily mingled
black millinery and sapphire-blue tailorings.
One of the newest lines in engagement-
rings is being flashed by Enid Iforrigan, of
Wemabung station, Trangie. The young maix
is Sydney Burns, of Petersham.
Margaret Dick, second daughter of the
Director of Public Health, was married in
St. Stephen’s midway through last week to
Dr. Bruce Stephen, son of Padre A. Stephen,
of Roseville. The official recorder was a
reverend uncle of the bridegroom, P. J.
Stephen. Against her swathed gown of ivory
satin and tulle the bride carried a sheaf of
flowering-plum and azaleas, and a lace veil
mellow with age called forth the note of
exclamation. Ruffling in pale green organdie
frills, sister Elizabeth followed the train of
satin and tulle, and Mrs. Dick beckoned the
guests to refreshments iix Burdekin Hoxxse.
“The sum of £4565 brought in by Girls’
Week,” read out a sturdy sportswoman to her
husband. “Dear me,” he muttered, over the
washing-up sink, “what do you think sti-ong
girls might earn?” Anyway it’s not a bad
start towards the £15.000 the City Girls’;
Amateur Sports Association wants for its
playing-fields.
The Army and Navy favored the dance for
the Sxxnbeam Fi’ee Kindergarten which, of
course, had to happen on the wettest and
coldest night of the week. The Wentworth
received the numbed guests into an atmo-
sphere radiant with lights, flowers and jazz,
and the golden glory of president Mrs. Gor-
don Bennett’s table matched her resplendent
attire of cloth of gold sewn with sequins.
Supporting her was her General, who helped
her entertain a party fruity with colonels,
majors and naval commanders. Here were
Mrs. Leo Quick, graceful in black lace, with
her sea lord, and the Love lady, who wrapped
herself in gold chiffons and a sea-green houri
coat. The secretaries were Eileen Clamp
and Flora Murchison, and a brisk sale of
chocs., posies and fans was carried out by a
group of irresistibles. One of the prettiest
smoking jackets in gold was slipped by Mrs.
Harold Vale over her leaf-green chiffons.
It distressed a number of Sydney art-
lovers to see so much of the Dr. Fox col-
lection of Eastern art treasures, which was
sold in the Lawson sale-rooms last week,
go to Melbourne. Efforts were made to get
public-spirited people to buy some of the
costly collection for public art institutions,
especially for the new' Museum of Applied
Arts; there was added mortification in the
reflection that some of the best pieces could
have been secured by local interests at con-
siderably lower prices than were paid by the
Felton Bequest trustees and private Mel-
bourne buyers. Something similar happens
frequently, and is bound to go on happening,
for the simple reason that Melbourne is a
far better art market than Sydney.
Next Wednesday night the gentlemen of
the First Light Horse (thex-e is an old A.I.F.
quip about the English C.O. who started to
address the troops as “Gentlemen of the
Light Horse and Men of the Infantry”) in-
tend to foregather at Adams’s Hotel to discuss
dinner and old battles. No. 1 of the Bri-
gade is to be there, but all the members (and
they went to 3000) are wanted. E. D. Camp-
bell, who in the mysterious A.I.F. way be-
came “Harry,” is doing the secretarying.
The first big dance of the week fluttered
the 'Ambassadors with the pleasing aroma of
the best powders and lipsticks and the
dazzle of the newest in frocking. This dance
was in aid of Furlough House, th e A.I.F.
holiday home at Narrabeen, and with that
indefatigable worker Miss Annie Cook as
secretary, it was assured of success. George
Fuller’s lady w r as the president, and Mrs.
A. J. Stewart the treasurer. Lady de Chair
brought a party which included the Attorney-
General of Zanzibar and his starry-eyed
wdfe, and the Kingsley Newell couple. The
Maitland lady was one of the night’s out-
standing pictures in pale lilac moires, the
full skirt ruched and garlanded. Ernest
Watt had daughter Pauline at his table,
while golden-haired Pamela disported in a
party near by.
A cabled blessing from the Pope is proudly
tucked away with the marriage-lines of one
Randwick bride of last week. She, was, before
she became Mrs. A. L. Finn, of Homebush,
Claire Thom, youngest daughter of the late
,T. Thom, of Temora.
Kilmorey, the surgeon MacCormiek home
at Point Piper, was not done out of its race-
week frolic through the absence of the
knight and his lady. Daughter Mrs. John
Martin kept up the family tradition, sup-
ported by just-returned uncle Cropper, and
the dance wms quite up to the high standard
set in former years. The rooms were a
blaze of flowers, the courtyard was awninged,
a party arrived from Government House, and
.all the best-known people came in their
best and least-known clothes.
A correspondent is annoyed:—
Allow me to say a heated word or two on
the subject of- retiring-rooms for women. There are
all kinds of these in Sydney—fair, bad and worse.
At the fair places the fees are frequent and excessive.
At the others —well, women are supposed to be the
particular sex, but I’ve never noticed any agitation
for improved conditions, and Heaven knows an agi-
tation is needed. Women, who earn less than men.
are charged fees which men don’t have to pay; and
the facilities are mostly such as would not be tolerated
in any decent home. I went in for a nose-powder
and brush-up at a railway-station the other day, and
couldn’t even get water to wash my hands. At
many of the beastly places there are small fountains
at which, by putting a penny in the slot, one may
receive a splash of alleged perfume. Presumably
there are profits for somebody in these excrescences,
and it would surely be a fair thing to spend them
on improving the dismal and insanitary necessities.
A.G.M. from London :
Mrs. Osborne (Maud Jeffries), the handsome lead-
ing lady whom Wilson Barrett brought to Australia
and who retired into private life on her marriage,
is now visiting her people in Louisiana (U.S.). , A
New York manager made an offer for a return to
professional life, but it was met by a shake of the
head.
If enthusiastic “coo-eeing” and patriotic Austra-
lians can ensure a path of gold for “The Climax” at
the Little Theatre, Dorothy Brunton will be on the
high road to brilliant fame. She has been acclaimed a-
a star, and though the older critics frankly' com-
mented on her faults, they' were just as liberal
with her praise. So much importance did Aus-
tralia’s old friend Hugh D. Mclntosh (who present'
the play) attach to his two principals that he toot
out £lOO-0 policies insuring their appearance.

Nobody really trusts our climate, and the
Caulfield Guineas meeting brought out very
little that was new in raiment. Coats and
skirts and ensemble suits were general.
Severity is now the keynote of smartness in
both attire and millinery, and it looks as
if the Tuscan straw hat, simply banded with
ribbon, will outstay the crinoline flower-
decked nut-covers. Black and white effects
were again favored in tailored costumes,
with a fair sprinkling of white vests devoid
of frill or lace. Ileal lilies of the valley or
an artificial camelia pinned on the coat were
the only ornaments added to tailored attire.
Ensemble suits were on the same lines as
last year, being usually of black satin com-
bined with small-patterned fancy silks or
foulards. The jumper suit is still with us,
and some pretty examples were seen, some-
times worn with a sleeveless coat. Sunburn
is no longer feared, and many wore the close-
fitting helmet hats. Only two sunshades were
raised on the lawn during the running of the
big race. The Somers pair came after open-
ing the War Exhibition and invited Dame
Nellie Melba and others to luncheon. Lady
Somers looked charming with a Tuscan straw
hat above a jumper suit of apple-green crepe
lie Chine. Colonel and Mrs. Davidson, Cap-
tain and Mrs. Macdonald, she in ensemble of
black with black picture hat, were members
of the v.-r. party. Mrs. Napier’s jersey
suit of nattier-blue trimmed with white was
topped by a blue felt hat. Mrs. E. M. Pearce
radiantly received congratulations on her
husband's double —in a frisco coat and skirt
of grey flecked with blue and a navy hat.
Mrs. James Grice, wife of the V.A.T.C.
chairman, was accompanied by Mrs. Claude
Grice, who was in mushroom-pink. Mrs.
Harry Creswick chose an all-black effect.
Mrs. Robert Knox looked cool in biscuit-
colored lace and georgette and a wide-leafed
hat of brown. Valerie Hennessy was a pretty
maiden in mushroom-pink, and Phyllis Holmes
Hunt’s grey-blue hat and frock brightened
the committee-box, Jocelyn Purves Smith’s
yellow sports attire and same colored hat
making another splash of color. Mrs. H. P.
Willis was in navy-blue witli a trimming of
geranium-pink and silver. Mrs. Lort Smith
and her sister, Miss Montgomery, the latter
in summery raiment of white and green;
Mrs. Charlie Lyon, nice in black ; Mrs. Percy
Blackburn, also a successful wearer of black :
Madame Mortill, Mrs. Corrie Gardner, Mrs.
A. V. Ivewney, Mrs. Rupert Downes and
Mrs. T. A. Tabart were on the lawn.
Anglican social workers saw a dream
realised one afternoon last week when Lady
Somers officially opened the Babies’ Home at
Darling, in the former home of the Frank
Stogdale couple. When Mr. Stogdale decided
to live in the city he gave the C. of E.
Mission an opportunity to purchase the place
at a low price and on very liberal terms. An
appeal for funds was successful, though all
the money required is not yet in, and now 22
babies are cradled in the comfortable house
with its beautiful grounds, and there is
room for nearly 50 more. The Sisters of the
Community of the Holy Name are in charge.
These infants were formerly cared for at
Brighton. Rooms in the new institution
have been named for such friends as the
Warwick Girls’ School, the .Canterbury
Ladies’ Auxiliary and A. L. Wettenhall, who
organised the money-getting campaign. Arch-
gaiters Lees dedicated the home, and tea was
served on the lawns.
The State Governor on Saturday opened
the second exhibition of war pictures, models
and relics at the Exhibition building. There
are four bisr models of military engagements,
made by sculptors Leslie Bowles and Wallace
Anderson and painter Louis McCubbin.
Hilda Rix Nicholas is the only woman
painter represented, her portrait of a French
peasant woifian being chosen. The gilt
frames, made on the premises, are adorned
with decorations of gum-leaves and gum-
nuts, and waratah and foliage.
On Friday afternoon there was a clinking
of teacups at the Victoria League head-
quarters to say au revoir to Mrs. Arthur
Hordern, who is taking her daughter Mary to
the Big Smoke and Paris to study the art
of the dance. Mrs. Hordern has been actively
engaged on the hospitality committee of the
league, and the president, Mrs. Fred Bird,
wearing navy blue with a dash of grey,
wished the guest of honor a pleasant journey
and handed her a pretty posy.
The L.A.B. Music Club had as its guests
at the Lyceum Club on Friday night Leila
Doubleday and her husband Max Pirani,
who is one of the Australian examiners for
the Associated Board. The party served a 3
farewell to the violinist, who returns to
London this week, having concluded her con-
tract as supporting artist with tenor Hislop.
The Pirani couple, he at the piano, played
the Second Sonata for violin and piano by
Delius, and the Kreutzer Sonata. The fiddler,
who wore a black frock with silver embossed
lace, was handed a posy by the club secre-
tary, Sibyl Hull, whose frock was of amber
tone embellished with gold lace. Louise
Gargurcvich, in glittery white gown, played
some Brahms numbers, and Victoria Ander-
son sang songs by Schumann and more mod-
ern composers, accompanied by her teacher,
Mrs. Harold Browning. Basil Johnson, one
of Max Pirani’s colleagues, spoke interest-
ingly about the teaching of music. Treasurer
E. 11. Prockter and Mrs. Prockter, Mar-
jorie Ilatchard and Mrs. T. Marshall Wood
were present.
The Sisters in charge of St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital have ceased worrying about the linen
cupboards. A dinner-dance at Scott’s the
other evening, engineered by St. Vincent’s
Linen League—the Hennessy lady is presi-
dent —provided the funds required. Miss
M. T. Doyle, lion, sec., wearing a black robe
brightened with glimmer, beamed on a crowd
that exceeded all expectations. Dr. Murray
Morton’s helpmeet wore a gown of bur-
gundy tone, and surgeon Hugh Devine’s wife
had attachments of crystal upon her coral-
pink robe. The vice-presidents, Mrs. J. J.
Bren an and Mrs. James Alston, were there;
also the treasurer, Mrs. E. M. Cleary, who
brightened a black gown with a shoulder
posy. Mrs. McCallum Neil displayed a
sparkle of crystal on a sea-green frock. Dr.
and Mrs. A. Forrest, the Peter Lynch couple
and many unattached maidens and men
helped to mak e up a gay gathering.
Headmistresses of girls’ schools are plan-
ning a series of tea-drinkings in honor of
Miss Pennethorn, general secretary of the
Parents' Education Union, who has come
from England to look over our system and
explain the aims of her movement. During
her stay Miss Pennethorn will be housed
at Ridley College, St. Kilda-road, as the
guest of Mrs. Eustace Wade, and a select
few have been bidden to coffee and conversa-
tion at an early date.
May Gutteridge, who for five years has
been supervisor of Free Kindergartens and
principal of the Kindergarten Training Col-
lege, lias decided to take a year’s holiday. She
intends to set sail for England in December;
will spend some months looking into kinder-
garten methods there, and then will under-
take a course of study at Columbia Uni-
versity. Miss Rosner, of Brisbane Kinder-
garten College, will take Miss Gutteridge’s
place during the latter’s absence. Miss Gut-
teridge, who received her training at the
Froebel Institute in London, started an ex-
perimental kindergarten in the Big Smoke
during the war for children one to three
years old and it proved highly successful.
In France, later, she did similar work among
destitute infants.
This serious-looking lassie is Molly Mac-
kay, really a very bright young person, but
a Nash-Bootliy camera caught her in medi-
tative mood. She inherits musical talent
from both
parents. Her
mother,
Madame Jose-
phine Mackay,
was for many
years a favor-
ite singer of
Scottish and
Irish ballads,
and her father,
Professor T.
M. Mackay,
was a famous
Scottish piper
and dancer,
and acted
with Bland
Holt, the late
Robert
Brough and
others. Miss
Mackay, who
is a singer of
promise, re-
ceived the greater part of her tuition from
her mother, with some final polish from
Walter Kirby. At her first recital, to be
held on October 25 at the Assembly Hall,
she will be associated with Estelle Sheehan,
a young pianist bound for the Big Smoke
next year, flautist C. Richard Chugg, Cap-
tain Guy Moore, of the Flying Corps, a tenor
singer of merit, and accompanist William
Burrell.
Dame Melba’s latest protege is Jack Cato,
who was a portrait photographer in Hobart
when the diva first saw his w r ork and acclaimed
it as the best she had seen outside of Paris—
where, by the way, Mr. Cato got his training.
Now he has set up a studio in Elizabeth-
street, which was opened by Dame Nellie
with all sort of pomp and ceremony on
Thursday afternoon. The great singer looked
radiant in an ensemble-suit of berry-juice
hued crepe de Chine, with squirrel fur and
dark-grey velour hat. Not only did she say
the opening words but played the part of
hostess in her most charming manner. Among
those who partook of tea were Mrs. George
Armstrong, Mrs. Charles Lempriere and her
daughter Helen, Mrs. Byron Moore, Mrs.
David Grant, the French Consul and
Madame Turck, Mrs. C. H. Lamprill, of
Hobart, Mrs. Fred Cato and Mrs. Edwin
Cato.
Members of the Women’s Automobile Club
indulged in jazz and bridge at the home of
Mrs. John Frost, Armadale, on Thursday
night, instead of the usual card-party at the
club rooms. The change was appreciated.
The hostess’s gown, of ombre tones of lemon
and orange and gold thread embroideries,
blended with the decorations of lilac and
Iceland poppies. The club president, Mrs.
H. J. Robertson, wore green georgette allied
to gold lace. Mrs. Edgar Dye was in black,
and her daughter Audrey blended jade-green
chiffon and gold tissue. Jean Clack’s frock
was of roseate-liued lace and chiffon.
When the Repertory Society puts on
“Liliom” at the King’s Theatre on Caulfield
Cup night, the
leading role
will be en-
trusted to
Norman Simp-
son, here pic-
tured by Rem-
brandt. H i s
connection
with the Rep-
ertory move-
ment goes
back to 1921,
and his wife,
fo£pierly Mary
Curtain, was
a valued mem-
ber of the
R.T.S. prior
to her mar-
riage. Mr.
Simpson acts
with intelli-
gence and ver-
satil i t y.
Though he takes a few pupils for elocution,
he is mainly engaged with the production of
plays for am. dram, societies and the like.
This year a majority of such efforts in this
city were produced under his guidance.
There was dancing, bridge ana music at
the Green Mill on Thursday afternoon to
add something to the height and girth of the
million shilling mountain, which, when it
attains full stature, will provide us with a
permanent orchestra. Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
Mrs. J. Winter and Mrs. Percy Russell were
responsible for the gathering. Beryl Ainslie,
Mrs. T. Marshall Wood and others selling
sweets and smokes.
On Saturday evening, Jean, eldest
daughter of the J. J. Maynards, enfolded in
misty bridal array, was taken to Adamson
Hall at Wesley College where she had pro-
mised to face the altar with Eddie, second
son of the F. Strapps, of Hawkesburn. The
Midal gown of white georgette flushed with
faint pink and the veil of Limerick lace was
set with sprays of orange blossom. Bess
M °ott. a cousin, and sister Bonnie attended
her in pink lace frocks and hair-bands orna-
mented with posies.
Ivory ninon with a wealth of Limerick
lace, ancient and modern—the veil was made
more than a century ago—formed the bridal
array of Nessie, daughter of the W. E. Lillie
couple, of East Malvern, when she became
Mrs. James C. Shaw at the Malvern kirk.
The bridegroom is the elder son of Mr. and
Mrs. W. P. Shaw, Toorak. The bride’s
sister Jean and Marjorie Van Cooth were
’maids, holding posies of golden-brown pan-
sies against frocks of apricot-toned georgette.
There were rejoicings afterwards at No. 9.
The Sunday between Derby and Cup days
has been shrewdly selected by Xavier Col-
lege for the laying by Archgaiters Mannix
of the foundation-stone of the memorial
chapel. A few thousand spectators are ex-
pected in the ample grounds at Ivcw. The
chapel will cost £25,000 and is to be finished
next year, when the jubilee will be celebrated.
About £9OOO is in hand, and some heavy
cheques are expected on.the 30th. Father
Francis O’Keefe, an old boy, who is on the
col. staff, is as busy as a circus advance-
agent making preparations.
Vera Bradford, a young pianist who gave
a recital at the Assembly Hall last week
pleased the critics. She' exhibited a good
technique, backed by feeling and intelligence.
Her principal offering was the extremely
complex Schumann Sonata in F sharp
minor, garnished with some Chopin and
Beethoven.
The Y.W.C.A. pageant “Children of the
Dawn,” at the Auditorium, was an elaborate
and successful production. Dawn, played
by Irene Shaw, in a shimmer of pink veiled
in clouds of grey tulle, ushered in a proces-
sion of figures, beginning with Hilda, Abbess
of Whitby, illustrating the good work of
women in various ages. Some 500 girls
participated in the pageant. An exhibition
of calisthenics by lassies in green tunics with
gold tasselled girdles, was much admired.
The shapely limbs of the performers would
not have been out of place in the front row
of a panto, ballet. Stage manager Florrie
Finn looked pleased, and had every right.
The frivol known as “Getting Gertie’s
Garter,” which is filling the Palace Theatre
just now, is prolific of frocks, frills and
lingerie. Mary Gannon spreads a silver
wrap over a frock of white scattered with
glistening adornment. Rose Duggan com-
bines silver lace and ninon of deep pink hue,
and Barbara Felton’s frock of soft green
georgette is envied by many.
Nine Yankee maidens in black evening
frocks, with shawls arranged in Spanish
mode, and black toreador hats from the brims
of which pink roses dangled, constituted the
orchestra at St. Ivilda Palais de Danse on
Saturday night, and they played with no
little vim and animation.
Shoes are likely to play an important
part in the dressing for the races. One firm
is holding this week a special display of
imported footwear, Vienna, Prague, Paris,
London and New York having been drawn
upon for novelties. There are shoes of a
leather that can be laundered, and others in
which raffia is used decoratively. Evening
shoes are shown in shades to blend with any
gown—the heels sprinkled with brilliants,
and straps and toes exquisitely beaded.
One of England's biggest industrial bosses,
Sir Henry Cowan, steps off shipboard this
week, accompanied by his wife and daughter.
His mission is to launch his firm’s new fac-
tory at Footscray. Lady Cowan will be
welcomed as one who has done her bit to
help Australia. She is one of the leaders
of the inter-Empire trading movement, and
the Empire Shopping Week, which made a
successful beginning recently in London,
was her idea.
An Australian writes that while in London
she saw a good deal of the Jack McLaren
couple, who are making their presence felt
in literary circles. Mrs. McLaren is remem-
bered in Melbourne as Ada Moore, a jour-
nalist. Her husband is the author of “My
Crowded Solitude” and other books.
Gertrude Boswell, last seen here with the
G. B. Post co., is back after 18 months of
absence in England and U.S. While in
America she played with the late John
Drew’s co. in a revival of “Trclawny of the
Wells.” The piece was a huge success, and
after a successful Broadway season was
taken on tour. Miss Boswell is at present
weighing a London offer against her love of
Australia’s sunshine.
Flora Back, well known as an inventor of
surgical appliances, has returned from an
eight-months’ visit to Maoriland. She crossed
the Tasman in January to be on hand during
the Medical Congress, and she found a big
demand for. her appliances.
The R. W. Wilmots, who have been in-
specting other countries and their peoples,
are home again wearing a contented expres-
sion. On their way through America they
called on their married daughter, Mrs. Bemis.
Eileen O’Keefe, one of the most talented
of our speakers of verse, is making the
most of her holiday abroad. In London she
pursued her studies under leading exponents
of elocution, and at latest writing was in
Germany. She intends to return at the end
of the year.
By the death of his father. Alexander
Fox-Pitt-Rivers, George Pitt-Rivers, who
married Lord Forster’s daughter, has come
into a tidy rent-roll. The dead man was
a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquar-
ians. His son, who has just published a
book, “The Clash of Culture and the Con-
tact of the Races,” went in for anthropology,
a taste inherited from his grandfather, who
founded the Pitt-Rivers museum at Oxford.
Mrs. Pitt-Rivers explained her stage career
as Mary Hinton by saying “My husband has
Ms interest and he realises that I am entitled
to mine.”
Society held out the glad hand of welcome
to the Dodds family, which rested here on
their way to Sydney, where the Major-Gen-
eral is to take up an important appoint-
ment. Mrs Dodds, who last year had a rough
time after a surgical operation, has regained
her health, and the family, two girls and a
boy, have become grown-ups in the years of
absence.
Renie Bartley’s elocutionary recital at the
Queen’s Hall attracted a good-sized crowd,
and there were plenty of posies and choco-
lates for her at the finish. Her white gown
was trimmed with sparkling bands of silver
sequins. Shakspeare, John Oxenham and
Rudyard Kipling were drawn upon for
material. Songs by baritone Kenneth Im-
pett, who was making a farewell appearance
—lie is bound for Italy to continue his
studies —were an enjoyable feature of the
programme.
Phyllis, the fair-haired daughter of Bob
Best and his lady, now on her way to
England with the Jack Wilcox couple,
intends to stay with Gerry Fripp’s people
in London while she looks round for an
opportunity in Stageland.

The advantages of having a Governor who
is also a doctor were demonstrated last week
when, during the vice-regal tour of Queens-
land a motor mishap severed an artery in
Major Wolff’s head. His Ex. took the case
in hand, and turned the patient over to the
Dalby Hospital in good shape.
General Foott and other brass-liats went
as far as Jandowie with Sir John and saw
the presentation of the Lord Forster Cup vo
the Jandowie troop, returning by rail from
Mac Alister. Years ago, before the country
was opened up, Jandowie boasted one way-
side inn—a long white building with the
usual bush graveyard at the rear, and wan-
dering goats ad lib. Here “Mary the maid
of the Inn” was courted by bachelors of the
district.
The vice-regal party stayed with W. A.
Russell, who now owns Joshua Peter Bell’s
historic mansion. At the Dalby sanatorium
Matron Nott received his Ex.
An unofficial visit to the Bunya Moun-
tains, where long ago brother Binghi used
to assemble in hundreds every three years
for the feast of the Bunya nut, is the item
for this. week.
While Sir John is away, Lady Goodwin
keeps the home fires burning at Government
House. She entertained representatives of
various leagues at afternoon tea there, and
was present at Mrs. Gilbert AVilson’s con-
cert last week.
The Lyceum Club is inviting Queensland
authors to send lists of their printed books,
each member of the club pledging her immor-
tal 'soul to buy one as a Christmas present
for a friend. This is practical help!
Clever Dorothea Howes secured special
honors in the A.N.A. elocutionary contests.
Her choice of a poem was Australian —“The
Fairies’ Hats,” by M. Forrest, in The
Bulletin. Edith Rowett won the Sliak-
spearean and champion recitation, and Mar-
jorie Green secured the Regent scholarship.
Miss A. Fleming won the Dickens prize.
This year had a record for entries.
Popular Mrs. J. H. Fairfax was again
elected president of the Queensland Country
Women’s Association at the Charleville con-
ference. As she is soon going to England
there was some discussion about a deputy,
and Mrs. Mylne, of Wynnum, was proposed
for this position.
The Repertory Society has picked Dorothy
Webster, daughter of the George Websters,
for juvenile lead in its next play. She is
only a slip of a girl, just from school, but
inherits her father’s dramatic gifts. He is
always spoken of as “quite a professional.”
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
Cheek-by-jowl with Christ Church, and in
one of the most picturesque corners of North
Adelaide, Bishop’s Court (its official occu-
piers are still away, and the Keith Bow-
mans leased it for a week or two) made a
delightful setting for the Cowan-Bowman
wedding. The tall, fair bride was all white
and silver, deepening to the old ivory of her
Brussels-lace train, and flushing to palest
pink about the silver roses that trailed on
her skirt. For the five bridesmaids—her two
sisters, two small nieces and Moilie Cowan—
superimposed layers of tulle made frocks of
real delphinium blue, and there were del-
phiniums and Cecile Brunner roses in their
posies. The hridal party walked through the
church grounds and the Bishop’s Court
garden to the house after the ceremony—
a picturesque procession.
This is Sylvia AVliitington, one of the
most popular members of the Con. staff, and
leader, since
its inception,
of the South
Austral ian
Orchestra. Her
engagement to
George Pearce,
also o f the
staff, is just
announced.
Miss Whiting-
ton is a tri-
umphant ex-
ample of what
an Australian
may accom-
plish in her
own country,
for all her
training and
experience has
been gained
here. She
has been one
of the Con.’s
string quartette since the beginning (it
came into existence in Dr. Ennis’s day. and
Nora Kyffin Thomas was for a time one of
its members), and in that plays the viola.
A poisoned hand has written a temporary
finis to Miss Pennethorne’s efforts here for
the P.N.E.U.. and she is in hospital. Miss
Collison, of Woodlands, has undertaken the
local secretaryship.
Mrs. A. Y. Benson hostessed lunch and tea
at the Amateur Turf Club’s meeting at Chel-
tenham, which happened on a day that drove
women back to winter wrappings and, if
she were wise, to raincoat and umbrella.
A frock or two made brave but uncomfort-
able appearance, but the two smartest women
on the lawn were severely tailored—one,
tall and fair, in putty tweeds, the otheri
slim and petite, in black.
Marie Robertson is not enamored of a
New York summer —a trying alternation of
violent heat-waves and equally violent
thunderstorms. She is hard at it preparing
for her autumn and winter seasons.
Liberal women have farewelled with regret
Mrs. Claude Flanders, bound for Bombay
after a longisli stay here with her people.
She reckons that India has great possibilities
as a market for Australian produce, and she
vouches for it that things sent now are far
better, in grading and packing as well as in
quality, than they were two years ago.
This State is pluming itself on its suc-
cess at Ballarat, where Elsie Wooley and
Arnold Matters have annexed all the laurels
they’ve gone in quest of. Matters, who is
a product of Adelaide Con. and one of the
Bach Society’s soloists, is being urged to
give up the Government Service for the con-
cert platform.
From England comes news of d’Auvergne
Boxall, just back from a camping and sketch-

bound again, at Glasgow and Liverpool.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
It is Show Week and the city is full of
the Backbone of the Country, Mrs. Back-
bone and all the little Backbones. The rag
shops are bright with new spring finery,
brought forth by the sudden warmth of the
sun, the theatres are dusting their “House
Full” signs, and, as Shakspeare or somebody
remarked, all nature rejoices.
His Ex. opened this year’s wild-flower
show, and brought his guests, Sir Arthur
and Lady Lawley, along. It was a really
wonderful display, and an eye-opener even
to those who thought they knew all about
Westralian botany.
The dental students backed the wrong
horse when they organised a concert to raise
funds to buy an X-ray plant for the Dental
Hospital. There was but a meagre response.
Smart folk will not give up their bridge
for music. Perth Hospital Appeal committee
has found that out, and sticks to bridge
parties, which bring it in many shekels.
The vocal recital given by the pupils of
Frank Robertson in the Town Hall was a
pleasant gathering of parents and friends,
with piles of posies for the young singers
and gifts for their talented teachers.
Mrs. Sinclair McGibbon was hostess at
the King’s Park Tennis Club dance. There
was a big crowd, the frocking was smart
and attractive, and the piano fund “swelled
wisibly.” The right of this club to an
enclosure in King’s Park, which belongs to
the people, is challenged by many, but that
didn’t interfere with the evening’s enjoy-
ment.

Before coming
to Perth she
was one of the
leading tea-
chers in Kal-
goor 1 i e for
some years.
The anti-jazz movement is with us, its
first expression being an old-time dance
arranged by Mrs. C. L. Riley, wife of
one of our padres. The innovation had
some influential social backing, and the
waltz, the polka, the schottische and the
quadrille were found quite a pleasant change
from the eternal one-step, fox-trot and
Charleston.
Westralians have their fair share of the
wanderlust. The W. H. Vincents have
embarked on yet another trip to the Eastern
States; Mrs. Girdlestone and her son Marcus
Stone have booked passages to England, the
first stage of a three years’ pilgrimage, and
the John Stoddarts, with Doreen Brennan,
go to Colombo on the Chitral on the 17th.
Mrs. George Pearse has returned to Perth
after many years of travel in the Old World.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
The Launceston Show was a great success
this year, with a large attendance and
glorious weather. His Ex. and daughter
Margaret went north to visit it.
The O’Grady and Margaret attended the
annual meeting of the Child Welfare Associa-
tion, and the Governor said it was a pity
that there should be so many more appli-
cations for admission to the Mothercraft
Home than can be entertained, space being
so limited. Mrs. Mather, a member of the
Sydney Child Welfare Association, here on
a visit, gave a short address.
Our women graduates have started a club
of their own in the A.P.A. Chambers in
Macquarie-street, and, with the object of
raising funds for furniture, held a card party
at the Nook, which was well attended and
brought in a fairly substantial sum. The
scholastic element was strongly represented,
but the intelligentsia here are not above
bridge and mah jongg.
The Tas. women golfers had a great time
the North v. South matches in Launceston.
Hobart came down badly in most of the
events, but Lily Barclay held up our end well
by carrying off the ladies’ championship.
Before leaving the northern city, the visitors
were entertained at a bridge party held in
the lounge of the Brisbane, their hosts being
the associates of the Launceston Golf Club.
We have a roof garden now, for dances
and so on, on top of the handsome Bursary
House, where the Trocadero management
held an opening night last week. Given some
warm moonlight nights in the coming sum-
mer months, townsfolk and visitors should
find this feature very attractive.
Nancy Walch, eldest member of the Percy
Walch family, has promised to run in double
harness with Charles Findlay, also of this
city. The prospective bride was a deb. of
two seasons ago.

Her hard heart did not mince;
But he spoke about his Mother —
She has loved him ever since.

THE INKY WAY.
“C.Q.”: Talking of Bulletin plodders,
ono wrote to me the other day complaining
that of 209 pars, submitted by him only
one had rung the bell. On the other hand,
Tom (Hover, at the age of 17, suspended cow-
punching in Maoriland to do his first sketch.
It went in. The next to appear was his 07th.
“Ilerodot” : The Bulletin has had regular
readers in places even more remote than
Baku, on the Caspian Sea. A friend of
mine tells me that he used to mail it regu-
larly to Urga, in Mongolia, much further
oil the beaten track, where his brother was
in the British Consular service. The paper
went from Australia to China, being carried
for the final stages into the interior by cara-
van. The recipient usually received it in
hatches of tens or twenties, but of the whole
lot less than half a dozen went astray.
“Spare Sub”: In the closing stages of
the N.S.W. election campaign Labor con-
centrated all its propaganda on a sentimen-
tal appeal to the women and cheeldren, to
say nothing of the widows and the orphans.
Huge full-page ads., depicting a mother
telling her infants to vote, when they grow
up, for the dear Labor party that had saved
their homes from the capitalistic vulture,
were showered profusely on the alleged capi-
talist press, which, to do it justice, met the
challenge bravely, and didn’t refuse to publish
one of them. The move somewhat resembled
the feathering of the arrow aimed at the
oppressor with a pinion taken from his own
breast, to speak in mixed metaphor; but
apparently both parties to the transaction
were quite satisfied.
“Mars”: Chasing Costs in a small country
town. I was briefed to prosecute a man
who had violently resisted arrest during
a drunken row, and torn a John Hop's uni-
form. In addressing the Bench I stressed
the necessity for protecting constituted
authority from the clutching grip of Bolshe-
vism, etc., and the magistrate showed his
appreciation of my effort by fining the
accused 30s. Outside the court I met the
owner-editor-reporter of the local fag. who
warmly congratulated me on my address
and asked me to write it up for his paper,
an eight-page production of which about
seven were devoted to advts., etc. The fol-
lowing Saturday, my copy appeared as the
leading article, which encouraged me to send
in another contribution. This also appeared.
After the first flush of pride had worn off
I began to wonder what my literary efforts
were worth. At the first opportunity I
broached the question, of payment. "Oh-
don’t worry,” came the reply, "I couldn't
think of charging you for them. They made
finite good reading matter!”
“P.X.”: Nothing shows the great stride
the Sydney Sun has made better than the
fact that nowadays the S. M. Herald takes
notice of it. and plainly regards it as a
challenger. For years and years the Herald
didn’t mention its circulation; then there
was a par. in The Bulletin giving Herald
figures, which plainly showed that the old
lady was getting anxious. Following that,
a couple of months later, the Herald itself
announced its circulation figures (running
from an average of 168,411 in one week
to 171 221 in another) ; and. to prove that
something was biting it, it added: —
Note: Wo desire to point out that this circulation
is obtained on the quality of the Herald as a news-
paper, and is in no way dependent upon competitions,
free insurance or other circulation-making devices.
John Fairfax & Sons, Limited.
Whereupon nothing happened till the Com-
mission which inquired into _ the Herald s
so-called charges against Piddington reported
that Pid. was an “able and upright” Judge.
Then the Sun broke in with the announce-
ment that its circulation for five weeks has
averaged 196,298 ; and it added :
Note: We desire to point out that these actual
sales (not “circulation”) are obtained on the quality
of the Sun as a newspaper rendering public service,
and are in no way dependent upon sensational parti
attacks upon “able and upright” Judges.
Sun Newspapers, Ltd.
Things have changed from the days, not
more than 30 years ago, when the then
manager of the Star (the Sun’s predeces-
sor) reported to a general meeting that they
had some thousands of pounds’ worth of paper
in stock, and a shareholder who had gone
hungry for di\s. for many years broke in
with: “For God’s .sake let’s sell it-, before
we print on it and spoil it.”
THE TWO JOURNALISTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Both plod along the Inky Way,
The going mostly good and gay
But sometimes hard as flint.
Bob Baxter pens the paragraph
That raises many a cheery laugh,
While Peter Popjoy’s on the staff
Of a religious print.
Bob keeps his literary flag
Flying upon an evening rag;
Into his ken there swim
Most things that make the passing show
So rich and rare. High life and low,
And good and bad, and fast and slow
Alike are meat for him.
To politicians’ roars and gibes,
To alderman ic diatribes
Publicity he gives.
All scenes of int’rest he frequents,
From theatres and Parliaments
To stadia where aggressive gents.
Deface each other’s cliivs.
Beside the work assigned to Bob
Pete’s would appear the sort of job
To make one’s outlook black.
He never goes to plays or sports;
Sermons are all that he reports,
Synods and Prohibition snorts
And all that sort of tack.
Uubrics and Inge and books of prayer
He stews for editorial fare;
Yet, when the bar we breast,
A problem it’s to me become
Why Robert’s always dour and glum
While godly Peter sinks his rum
With gay and smiling zest.
Is it, I wonder, that the twain
Glimpse at the end of life's long lane
A more exclusive spot.
And thinking of the Golden Shore
Pete knows his name is on the door,
While Bob is haunted by a sore
Conviction his is not?

♦
Nellie Bramley and her supporters man-
age to extract a great deal of laughter out
of an original theme in the new play, “Baby
Mine,” staged at Sydney Grand Opera House
on Saturday. Reading in a newspaper an
estimate that 3000 husbands are passionately
devoted to children not their own, but
secretly adopted during their absence by
wives willing to go to any length short of
childbearing to please their lords, Zoie
Hardy, with the aid of her friend, Aggie
Jinks, devises a scheme to bring her tem-
porarily estranged husband back to her side.
Aggie’s husband, Jimmy, is dragged into the
conspiracy, as is only fitting, he being the
unknown man Avho wakened the suspicions
of Alfred Hardy by taking his wife to lunch.
Jimmy, however, is a trifle premature in
sending the wire announcing to his friend
that he is a proud father. The infant’s
mother backs out of her undertaking at the
last moment, with the result that Jimmy is
forced to steal the baby, and, with the
mother in hot pursuit, to find another infant
to work an exchange. At this stage it begins
to rain babies. Hardy, speeding to his wife’s
bedside, encounters Jimmy trying to sneak
out superfluous infants, and is invited to
believe that twins had arrived. He is even
ready to accept triplets as explaining the
situation, but an incursion of angry parents
and police brings a show-down from which,
after a' crescendo of laughter has been
reached, happiness is sorted out.
si: s|= Hs *
The cast does adequate justice to the
farcical material. Nellie Bramley gives an
admirable picture of the affectionate but
shifty wife; and Brett Randall puts in some
good work as the man who hates lies but is
delighted at triplets. Mabel Gower portrays
Aggie competently, but George Hewlett re-
duces the embarrassment of Jimmy Jinks in
the early stages to sheer idiocy. He makes
amends later, especially when he is patheti-
cally complaining, as he is sent here and
there in pursuit of babies, that he has had
nothing to eat. Victor Knight is responsible
for a fine minor sketch of an enraged father
in pursuit of purloined twins; and both
Marie D’Alton and Eve Downey help the
fun with their characterisations of a poor
and distracted mother and a gawky girl so
used to babies that she doesn’t know why
anyone should particularly want them.
“The Chocolate Soldier” exhausts its
sweetness to-morrow (Friday) night; on
Saturday patrons of Sydney Her Majesty’s
will be able to see what “Castles in the
Air” look like in a stage setting. That
rapidly promoted little Australian Rowena
Ronald appears in a leading part, and the
principal, male lead will introduce a new man
from England, Roy Russell. “Our Wife”
will cease talking next week at the
Criterion) where “Rain” is due to fall on
Saturday, October 22. The St. James
Theatre is getting no dust on any
of its seats, although “Lady, Be Good” has
already had a long run; and Maurice Mosco-
vitch still finds “The Ringer” too successful
to shelve, although “The Music Master” is
waiting at the door of the Royal.
“Outward Bound” continues a genuine draw
at the Palace; the last time this Show-
man dropped in he found the tense interest
of the audience as intriguing as the play
itself. When the haughty vamp lady came to
her turn for judgment by the Examiner, the
general sigh of anticipation suggested that
every man had had some sort of experience
with that type of woman, and every woman
had hated her, and everyone wanted to see
her get her deserts.
Joseph Hislop, whose golden notes are be-
ing kept in Australasia for the Grand Opera
season, will be heard again at the Sydney
Town Hall on October 26. The occasion will
be the production of “Faust” by the Royal
Philharmonic Society, and the background
should be a fine one for the tenor’s singing.

“Tweekie” has been ushered in at the
Empire Theatre (Sydney) by a gala per-
formance, but as it only took place last
night, The Bulletin’s impressions must be
held over. A new cast comes with the new
piece; the players include a lady who is a
“rand-daugliter of Edgar. Allen Poe.
The charming old music of Pergolesi
breathed as fresh and fragrant as a newly
gathered bouquet through Sydney King’s Hail
last Saturday. “The Artful Servant” (La
Serva Padrona), from the melodic pen of the
Italian composer, was the gay little opera
chosen by director De Giorgoi to show the
voices and paces “6f three of his star pupils.
Of these Bessie Blake was the attractive
and artlessly artful Serpina, John Coleman
was the Master she had resolved to turn into
a husband, and Cecil Scott the dumb ser-
vant Vespone, the instrument by which she
fired the jealousy of Überto. The opera is
simple and sweet —like a waterfall in Arcady
—and Bessie Blake, as the sparkling little
designer, was quite at home both in the
music and the stage-work; melodious and
easy, too, were John Coleman’s singing and
acting as Überto, while Cecil Scott proved
himself a master of pantomime. To-night
(Thursday) and Saturday the gay sweetness
will be repeated.
The plucky sisters who have made it their
.job to give Sydney periodical operatic per-
formances of a professional-amateur type
will venture upon “II Trovatore” at the
Conservatorium on Saturday next, re-
peating the performance on Monday. Miss
Rita Lancaster is herself directing the pro-
duction.
Jim Gerald returned to find an enthusi-
astic reception awaiting him at Fullers’,
Sydney, on Saturday; most of the members
of his company had a warm welcome, too.
Compared with the Gerald show, the antics
of Stiffy and Mo may well seem cheap and
tawdry. There is really good material and
some plot in “The Honeymoon Girl” ; May
Gearie has a voice of undeniably fine quality
for the principal-girl part; Betty Lambert
shows herself capable of managing a French
dialect prettily; Harry Burgess is a well-
made-up old general; Reg Hawthorne is a
good lover; and there are also Polly McLaren
and Ray McLean in whirlwind dances, and
Phyllis Du Barry. But, of course, Gerald
is the main ingredient. His last show was
good and his present one is even better.
Olsen and Johnson belong to the type of
boisterous comedian who spills your beer
and expects you to be convulsed with merri-
ment thereat. As the chief ingredient in
“The Tivoli Follies of 1927,” which com-
menced to occupy half the programme at Syd-
ney Tivoli on Saturday, they romp all over
the house, laughing uproariously at then-
own humors and spoiling the ventriloquial
burlesque with which they mainly pleased
on their first appearance. With this
pair are Elizabeth Morgan and Herbert
Browne from musical comedy, the Big
Four, dancer Edna Sanderson and Irene
North, besides sundries —the sundries are
some beauteous girls who kick very shapely
legs. Tfce show ought to be better when the
Olsen and Johnson arrangement has been
sub-edited. The loquacious Dick Henderson,
who is also on the programme, should be
seen before his threatened departure.
There is a refreshing air of reality about
“The Frontiersman,” shown at Hoyt’s
(Sydney). A tale of the Georgia-Alabama
frontier of 1813, it does without forest fires
or reckless gallops down mountain sides, and
the temptation to make a big feature of the
fight preceding the massacre of the inhabit-
ants of Fort Mimms by Indians is success-
fully resisted; the catastrophe is presented
in a tellingly-dramatic way. Greatly remi-
miscent of “The Marriage of Kitty,” “Afraid
to Love,” with which the Lyceum has
bracketed the moderately-amusing “The
Highwayman,” is spun out until the bright
beginning is lost in a wilderness of detail.
“The Seventh Heaven” is due to supersede
“The Night of Love” at the Crystal Palace
shortly.

Three Sydney art shows:—
There is the exhilaration of out-doors and the
charm of vigorous movement in the pictures of H.
Septimus Power, at the Hordern Gallery, Sydney.
No. 6, an “Equestrienne Portrait,” is a paint-poem
in springy motion, with the lady’s hack, hounds
clustering about its legs, conveying its rider towards
“The Meet on Exmoor” (No. 1), which is nearly
next door. This is the big picture of the collection,
and shows masterly treatment. There is a “Portrait
Group of Horses,” too, which is a remarkably faithful
affair. A water-color, “Morning Light” (No. 5), is
another that appeals strongly, and “An Australian
Pastoral” is typical of the artist’s breadth of outlook.
Romance is the essence of Carlyle Jackson, whose
exhibition is displayed in the Fine Art Gallery,
Boomerang House, King-street. He captures the
poetry of some atmospheric trick of nature in such
SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Fred Curran, comedian;
and Eddie, the clown.
pictures as the evening' view of the peaceful farm
scene in Walhalla, or the sun striking splendor out
of “Golden Stooks.” Peace is the prevailing note,
but a good sense of climatic disturbance is shown
in “Wind Tossed.”
Many of Norman Lindsay’s pictures in the small
show at the Macquarie Gallery dwell upon allegories
about artistic inspiration, from which it appears
that the mind of the artist—poet, musician or painter
—is largely occupied by tumbled masses of fleshly
women. Yet the general tendency of Norman Lind-
say’s recent art seems to be to get away from the
woman with the bulbous breasts and draught-horse
hips of his old inspiration—and to draw better. The
virility of treatment, still present, is shown admir-
ably in “Powers of Earth,” a drypoint; but probably
the best thing in the show is the water-color
“Drifted,” in which a monster derelict drifts' on
sluggish waters towards the rocks where the happy
water females disport themselves.
Three times last week the veteran and
versatile elocutionist Lawrence Campbell
kept an Assemblyful of Melbourne citizens
keyed up to laughter and incipient tears
through long solo programmes. His render-
ings of the Sentimental Bloke’s vicissitudes
with his bit of skirt and the Small Boy’s
Quarrel with his Stomach are not so much
recitations of other people’s writings as the
moods of Dawrence Campbell. As a dis-
play of sheer virtuosity his show stands
level with those of a Heifetz or a Friedman,
and even as feats of memorising they are
remarkable. Writer once asked Campbell
at a smoke night to elocute a piece he had
heard him give 25 years before. The elo-
cutionist had long forgotten all about it, but
the keynote of a single line opened the cells
of the past, and he threw it off his chest
without a moment’s hesitation.
* * * *
There will be two Vanbrughs iu Dion Bou-
cicault’s train when he arrives in Australia
for his forthcoming season of a mixed grill
of comedy. Prudence Vanbrugh is Irene’s
niece, but she earned her place in the cast
as much by her pleasing showing in London
as by her consanguinity. “Caroline,” by
Maugham, will be the first exhibit, and Mel-
bourne instead of Sydney the place, a per-
emptory cable from Boucieault the autocrat
having settled the Firm’s mind on that point.
If Wirths’ Circus did not announce its
approaching arrival at the old address in
Melbourne about this time The Bulletin
would feel tempted to delay publication until
it ascertained whether the Greatest Show
on Earth had been swallowed by an unre-
ported earthquake or stolen by the Bolshe-
viks. The show will open as usual to-morrow
at Olympia. Pallenberg’s bears, who ride
on skates, Chester Dieck, a motor-cycling
Indian who proves Newton to have been a
liar, and a strong man who supports a merry-
go-round on his head are turns stated to be
superior to anything the firm has obtained in
its whole 47 years of corporeal existence.
MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Hetty King, Impersonator.
Melbourne Auditorium would have had te
expand or burst to accommodate more people
than crowded into it on Saturday to see
Rufus Dawes serve “For the Term of His
Natural Life” upon the screen. That inno-
cent young man scarcely got into the full
stride of his misery until the second half.
Then the horrors of the penal system began
to accumulate about him with real dramatic
force until the happy ending arrived with
Sylvia on the raft —presumably a rescuing
ship and a free pardon are just over the
next horizon. Whatever the artistic demerits
of the film—and they aren’t so very many—
it does supply a vivid background to Aus-
tralian history. After the showing of this
picture there is no excuse for the picturegoer
to harbor the belief that the story of this
continent began with the Mayflower or the
Red Indian wars.
* * * *
Art in Melbourne :
Some of Jack Cato’s photographs of Tasmanian
people, at present showing at the London Stores,
Melbourne, have a plastic quality that renowned
artists fail to get into their portraits in line or oils.
The study of A J. Yilliers, the brilliant young
correspondent of the Hobart Mercury who joined
up as a flencher with the first Norwegian whaling
expedition to Antarctica five years ago, is as incisive
on its way as a Lambert. In the picture of Stafford
Bird, the well-known Tasmanian who forsook
the pulpit for politics, the camera has got
well beneath the skin. Interesting, as well
as artistic, is a picture of that cemetery
of ships, the spot between Port Elizabeth
and Durban where the roaring forties meet the
Indian Ocean winds. It was somewhere along this
stretch of waters that the Waratah suddenly turned
turtle with her freight of Australian passengers.
Following on Norman Lindsay’s eruption of per-
spiring femininity, Miss Cumbrae Stewart’s annual
parade of pastel nudes at the Athenaeum is like a
cold shower on a June morning. The figures have
as much emotional effect as so many bunches of
Iceland poppies in ginger-jars, and even the Rev.
Judkins could safely be taken to see them. Miss
Stewart’s pastel landscapes are pleasing pictorial
efforts, but her ladies all look as if they have
removed their under-garments solely to earn a crust
by posing stiffly for 40 minutes in a somewhat
draughty studio. One hind view, however,, peremp-
torily arrests the eye because of its excellent stereo-
scopic quality; it is called “Back of a Woman
but labelling others “Renunciation,” “Columbine’s
Dream” and “Reverie” doesn’t help. Ilylda M.
Atkins adds some angular etchings to the show, and
veteran John Shirlcw has work in the same medium
which shows that his needle has lost none of its
cunning.
Adelaide is back again to its old allow-
ance of one playhouse, in this instance the
Prince of Wales, where ’Kindling has been
occupying the boards, with Muriel Starr as
the young wife who pledges stolen goods so
that her baby may be born m a healthier
atmosphere than that of a New York tene-
ment house. Harvey Aaams is the Dutch
husband who disapproves of babies and theft,
but is finally reconciled to both. Mhdame
X” is to follow. At the Majestic, the Robert
Roberts Bon Bon Revue has a strong com-
pany, the prize exhibits being Maurice Jaffey
a good singer and versatile comediam and
June Mills, a lady of wit and weight. Resur-
rection,” the screen version of Tolstoy s story,
now being screened at West s Pictures, fea-
tures Russia in the old days, with sorm
«rmciul music by the* orchestra of more than
ordinary quality. At the Wondergraph,
Peter B. Kyne’s “The Understanding Heart”
provides some good drama, and “New York"
throws some new light on the city by the
Hudson. At the York, “Mons” is drawing
in more money than any previous war film;
and “Flaming Fury” presents a canine star
in the police dog Ranger. “Stop Flirting”
is a picture with a moral at the Grand: and
Mirths’ Circus has returned east after thrill-
ing patrons with a lion on an elephant's
back.
“L.ud”: Death has been busy amongst
London theatrical managers. James White,
Frank Curzon and Arthur Bourchier were
all in charge of West End playhouses, and
their places will be hard to fill. It means
probably a fresh influx of American specu-
lators —and the English stage is already suf-
ficiently Americanised.
“Hamfat”: Browning Mummery and
Harold Williams represent Australia in the
grand opera season at Covent Garden, which
began with queues waiting 15 hours for Puc-
cini’s “Turandot.” They have only small
parts, but no British singers have better—
the leads are cut up amongst Continental
stars. This may "be the end of Covent Gar-
den’s long history; the death of Jimmy
White is likely to lead to the sale of the
theatre to the London County Council, which
considered its purchase before but jibbed at
the price. If the L.C.C. buys, the markets
will extend over the spot. It means tearing
up the roots of much theatrical history ; but,
anyhow, the theatre needed rebuilding.
“F.D.D.”: J. B. Atholwood, now playing
in “The Ringer,” is something better than a
good amateur Sculptor. In his bungalow at
Diamond Bay, South Head, Sydney, is a
bust of J. C. Williamson that comes near to
the breath of life. And a battered repre-
sentation of the late Nelson Illingworth
depicts the original with an expression
peculiarly his when inviting a caller to have
a spot.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Arthur Bourchier's run
of 811 performances with “The Better ’Ole”
—which, incidentally, was produced with a
shabbiness that astonished visitors from Aus-
tralia —placed him among the record-makers.
The longest first-production runs, before
“Rose Marie” made fortunes in London, were
secured by these plays: “Chu-Chin-Chow,”
2238 performances ; “Charley’s Aunt,” 1466;
“The Beggar’s Opera,” 1463; “Our Boys,”
1362; “The Maid of the Mountains,” 1352;
“A Little Bit of Fluff” (now being revived
in Sydney by Nellie Bramley), 1241; “A
Chinese Honeymoon,” 1075; “Romance,”
1046; “Dorothy,” 931; “Paddy, the Next
Best Thing,” 867. Besides “The Better
’Ole,” “The Arcadians” (809) and “The
Boy” (801) were the only others to pass the
800 mark. “The Private Secretary” lifted
the curtain 785 times, and “The Merry
Widow” had only seven fewer presentations.
“Flaming Youth”: When Harry Hilling,
who has been for years in charge of Tivoli
publicity, goes to England he will take two
kangaroos as fellow-passengers. Hilling will
look out for turns which may please Tivoli
audiences, but his big job is to put Australia
more definitely on the London show maps.
The kangaroos are to help in the work.
“Santander” : Lorna Helms, who was in
the Williamson chorus until Gregan
McMahon gave her a chance, gets two or
three lines in a recent cable for relieving
Helen Menken of her part in “The Seventh
Heaven” at the London Strand when Helen
was absent through an accident. As the
value of a substitute is according to the sig-
nificance of the person she understudies,
Lorna is entitled to three cheers, for Helen
Merfken is among New York’s first flight.
For artistic reasons Miss Menken persisted
in playing in “The Captive” in New York
when persistence meant prosecution by the
police. The play ultimately got the com-
pany into trouble, though the lady pleaded
that her skilfully-treated theme could not be
listed among the mushy sex-dramas that were
then befouling the New York stage.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Six English mummers,
now in various Australian shows, were to-
gether in London a few years ago when
Gawthorne’s “The Wishing Well” was
staged. Peter Gawtliorne himself is with
“Outward Bound”; Harriet Bennett, who
was leading lady, is the girl who. gives her
name to “Rose Marie” ; and Basil Radiord
is with “The Ghost Train.” The others are
in vaudeville —Geraldo and Enid Adair on
the Tivoli and Wylie Watson with Fullers.
“Hamfat”: A curious little theatrical
romance reached the liappy-ever-after stage
before a registrar recently. Firstrobber
married the lady when she was 20 years old
and a new arrival on the stage; he was a
smart advance-agent. Presently he ran a
small company of his own to star her. The
moderate success of it was disturbed by
domestic turbulence built on mutual sus-
picions. Within four years Firstrobber had
fled with another lady. Divorce followed,
and Mrs. F. married again; but becoming a
widow, she returned to the stage. It was
30 years after their parting that Firstrobber.
desperately ill, awoke from a stupor to find
that he was being nursed by the bride of
his youth. As soon as he was able he
hurried off to the registrar.

ALWAYS SAFE IN A
BIG BLOW
No matter how stiff the wind is the Billabong is safe. The
Automatic Governor and Speed Regulator presses the brake
on the windwheel and slows it down to a safe pumping speed.
When a gale blows up, the Regulator throws the wheel out of
the wind, and does not bring it back till it is safe to do so.
OIL ONCE EVERY SIX
MONTHS
The new enclosed gear Billabong has
double massive gears working in an

Poverty
Point
“L. de Rideau”: The Vanbrugh-Bouci-
caults were to have house-warmed the Taits"
new theatre, opposite Melbourne Majesty’s.
But that enterprise is nowhere near com-
pletion, so it was decided to try the new
season on Sydney first. Then Boucicault
intervened and cabled his objections, so the
Firm’s productions are to be reshuffled, and
the producer will make his bow at the King’s
at the tail-end of this month. Boucicault’s
affection for a Melbourne opening amounts
almost to a superstition. He made his
first appearance in the village by the Yarra,
and his subsequent seasons kicked off from
that point. And yet he hasn’t always been
successful there. His Barrie plays weren’t
exactly a frost, but they didn’t set the Yarra
afire.
“Flaming Youth”: liowena Roland, who
is to take the principal girl role in “Castles
in the Air,” which opens in Sydney on Oct.
15, is another bright young Australian who
has gained the spotlight within the last few
months. A temporary loss of voice put her
back after she had first won managerial
notice; but the way she stepped into the
shoes of Beppy de Vries in “Madame Pom-
padour” when the Dutch actress was off
color opened the door for her again.
“W. Green” (Lond.) : An 80-year-old
melodrama is having a great run at the
Elephant and Castle, a people’s theatre in
South London. The play, “Maria Martin,
or the Murder in the Red Barn,” was known
to Australian actors in the ’sixties. The
Elephant version is made up of bits from
five different revivals, each manager having
altered the thing to suit himself. There is
a wronged gipsy who acts as hangman, first
uttering the gipsy oath, “An eye for an
eye! A tooth for a tooth ! Blood for blood!”
A trapdoor opens in the stage; the villain
drops, and the curtain falls. Terrific cheer-
ing.
“Yarra Ben”: Marie Burke is to make
her appearance in straight comedy before she
leaves for England. She will have the role
of a dashing cinema star in Anita Loos’s
farcical piece, “The Whole Town’s Talk-
ing,” which Gregan McMahon is staging for
the Williamson Firm at Melb. Royal. There
is no reason why the clever Marie should not
do well in comedy. Marie Tempest also
began her career in musical pieces.
e “Hamfat”: “The Music Master” has been
in the Williamson script store for years
waiting for the right man to play the part of
Von Barwig. The player, besides being an
actor with a personality, has to be a
musician. It is reckoned that Maurice Mos-
covitch fills the bill. In the last years of
his life the thing was a favorite of David
Warfield, who played it all over America.
“Wigs”: “Peggy, Behave!” is the catchy
title of a new comedy which Betty Ross
Clarke, the leading woman in “The Ghost
Train,” will exploit when the run of the
latter piece concludes. It was written by an
Australian —Frank Russell, a Melbourne
journalist, and is to see the footlights first of
all in Perth next month.
“Goldilocks”: The ill-luck that has
attended “Rain” has not frightened the Wil-
liamson management. Produced in Mel-
bourne by the Fullers, it was a failure.
Securing the rights, the Firm considered
that it was just the piece to suit Judith
Anderson, and put it into rehearsal. But
the leading lady’s continued illness wrecked
that plan. Now, the play is being given to
Margaret Lawrence, who should be able to
make something of the par+ of Miss Thomp-
son.
“I. Phelps”: A recent special performance
of “Julius Caesar” in New York was remark-
able for the supers engaged. Disguised in a
drab toga was Edgar Lee Masters, author
of “Spoon River Anthology.” Bruce Bairns-
father scowled at Marc Antony over the
dead body of Caesar. Edna May was present,
but her counterfeit of a tawdry lady of the
•slums was so good that all the opera-
glasses passed her by.
MASS PRODUCTION.
VOICE FROM THE AUDIENCE (as Trio commences an item) : “That’s the stuff! Three at
a time, and get it finished.”
Raymond Longford: “Minto” suggests
(B. 29/9/’27) that the success of “The
Sentimental Bloke” film was due to C. J.
Dennis’s insistence on his verse being used
whenever sub-titles were necessary. Mr.
Dennis had nothing whatever to do with
either casting or titling. The production was
carried out in its entirety by the late Lottie
Lyall and myself. It does not require an
effort of imagination to realise that Dennis’s
verse would be rather essential to any screen
version of the poem.
“Spokeshave”: The unquenchable Gregan
McMahon is going for his life just at
present. “The Whole Town’s Talking,” to
be turned on in Melbourne. “Liliom” and
“Old Adam,” the Repertory shows, are being
massaged into condition by his hands.
“L. de R.”: Wireless lias its uses in
theatrical production. Time was when an
imported company was dumped on the wharf
within a couple of days of its first appear-
ance with all its imperfections thick upon
it. The secret panel wherein the missing
will was hidden and a thousand other import-
ant details remained to be settled. Now-
adays imported company and Australian
producer can keep in touch with one another
by radio for weeks before the arrival of the
steamer. Dion Boucicault wore out the
operators of the Cathay with his messages
to the Firm’s headquarters on his voyage
from the Cold Land.
“Craiser”: There are stars who require
to be pushed from the firmament; there
are others who retire gracefully at the
climacteric of their career. Of the first variety
was Mrs. Patrick Campbell. I saw her in
1914 in “Pygmalion and Galatea,” and
even then her acting was grey about the
temples. Nevertheless, last year she turned
up in N’York in the part of a skittish damsel
who had to run up and down a ladder. The
audience meant to be kindly to the mature
lady, but it forgot itself over the ladder-
climbing episode. It cheered vociferously,
thus unconsciously betraying that it admired
her less for her acting than for her ability
to shin up a wall at an age when such feats
are usually left to younger persons. Our
Mrs. Brough is an example of the other
kind. In the last Boucicault season she
relapsed naturally and deliciously into the
role of venerable gentlewoman. In each
play she was to be found in an easy chair,
her needles in her lap, and by these means
she actually renewed her hold on the Aus-
tralian public. Incidentally, she must have
done a host of useful knitting.
“Cauboy”: Back from the rounds of
European playhouses, Mrs. Ernest Scott told
Melbourne Repertorians that Paris theatres
indulged in the unique custom of giving
matin6es for actors from other shows. The
custom isn’t unique as far as Melbourne is
concerned. Muriel Starr gave an afternoon
performance of “East Lynne” during her
late lamented season at the Princess, ex-
clusively for co-workers in other companies.
It was a screamingly funny show, the cast
making even more of a burlesque of it than
they had on ordinary nights. But Miss
Starr wouldn’t burlesque. She is an inten-
sely serious artist, and nothing would induce
her to treat a character with disrespect—
not even a character like the Lady Isabel.
“Philm Up”: Tremendous difficulties are
in the way of the making of Australian films
—showmen who have made their money out
of American pictures are convinced on the
point. The latest to sound a pessimistic
note is H. F. Phillips, managing director of
the Melbourne Capitol and the St. Kilda
Palais. Says this gentleman :
The days of the old stock cos., when one actor
or actress might play the part of an old person at one
time and of a young person later, have gone, and it
is now necessary to have each type depicted natu-
rally. This means that a co. beginning business in
Australia would have to keep more actors and
actresses than it could economically afford if it was
to present a fair range of pictures.
In other words, since there are no “types”
amongst Australian actors and actresses, the
making of successful pictures here is an im-
possibility. And this rubbish is solemnly
printed in all the newspapers as a serious
contribution to the question! Mr. Phillips
should be told that there are Australian
mummers at the present moment playing
every variety of part in their native land and
also on the London stage, where, indeed,
the managers cast them for “types” as soon
as they arrive.
“C. Boy”: Melbourne will soon possess
more theatres than it will know how to fill.
The King’s, the Royal, the Athenajum and
His Majesty’s are fairly well assured of con-
tinuity of employment, but the Princess
maintains a precarious existence, the Palace
is subject to occasional interruptions of nar-
rative, and the Playhouse scrapes along on
odds and ends of repertory, occasional pic-
tures and an itinerant lecturer or two. The
Tivoli isn’t always full and the Bijou some-
times resembles that empty bowl ir.’en call
the sky. Even the pitchers aren’t over-
populated, congested streets, bridges that
don’t get built and Melbourne’s climate con-
spiring to encourage the suburban theatre.
Despite these portents Rufe Naylor proposes
to build a new home of variety, the Taits
are erecting an “intimate” theatre, and
Prank Neil announces that he is going to
construct a playhouse of his own.
“Le de R.” Although it has the endorse-
ment of George Jean Nathan, the new
American device of including the audience
in the plot, as exemplified in “The Last
Warning,” doesn’t strike me as of any value
dramatically. Shakspeare worked off the
same dodge in “Hamlet,” but with certain
reservations. (Incidentally, he called his
play within a play “The Mousetrap”—in
“The Last Warning” it is “The Snare.”) He
kept his audience on the stage, where he
could look after them and see that they
talked, laughed and applauded at the right
places. At the Melbourne Athenmum per-
formance of “The Last Warning” the audi-
ence of “The Snare,” the play within the
play, includes the whole house. As half of it
is giggling or shrieking at the novelty of its
situation and the other half is “sliush-ing”
like a battalion of soda-water syphons, the
illusion is destroyed. The average theatre-
ful of amusement-seekers is an undisciplined
mob at best.
“Cauboy”: Amongst J.C.W.’s Christmas-
boxes to be opened in Melbourne will be
an English- company, as usual practically
all complete, which George Highland is
bringing. “The Cuckoo in the Nest” and
“Rookery Nook,” both fashionable comedies,
will be their offerings. “In the Next Room”
and “The Terror,” two mystery plays by
Edgar Wallace, who wrote “The Ringer,”
are other recent purchases; also “Inter-
ference,” a new London success. It would
be a great thing—at any rate, it would be
a new experiment—if the Firm tried the
talents of an all-Australian cast on at least
one of these.
“Moskva”: The playgoers are marshalled
in regimental order outside the theatre. A
word of command and they quick-march into
the auditorium. The curtain rises. An
empty stage jumble of iron cubes and pyra-
mids suggesting chaos. A motor-car tears
over a bridge built across the theatre and
plunges into the proscenium arch. More
motor-cars follow. A machine-gun raps out;
there is a rattle of musketry and the roar
of cannon. An armed car thunders on to the
scene spitting in all directions. The battle
rages all over the stage, slops over the foot-
lights into the foyer, and is even carried
into the street. The act is succeeded by the
scream of factory whistles, the crash of
hydraulic hammers and the hiss of escaping
steam—this is the new revolutionary drama,
as staged in Moscow. It purports to reflect
Communistic principles by suppressing the
individual. Pre-Bolshevik conventions like
dialogue and costume are rigorously excluded
or ferociously distorted. There are no star
actors —only a loud noise or a bad smell or
a spurt of vapor. At last, say the sponsors
of the new drama, the proletariat has found
expression. The proletariat would probably
prefer the Dolly Sisters, but it isn’t allowed
to say so.
“Cine Ma”: It looks as if the next gen-
eration will grow up believing that Ameri-
cans are all supermen and Britishers pol-
troons. A recent Yankee flickerdrama shows
Uncle Sam’s battle fleet off Shanghai land-
ing American marines to protect some
nurses. The Chinese mob attacks the heroes,
but though their faces are flowing with
blood they refrain from firing a shot. The
facts are that at Hankow (not Shanghai)
British marines (not Yanks) stood with
their arms interlocked for 12 hours fronting
a raving horde. They were spat on and their
heads broken open with stones, but they
had been ordered not to retaliate and they
didn’t. As for the U.S. fleet, it assembled
in such great force and idleness before
Shanghai that the British admiral suggested
that if it didn’t intend to do anything it had
better get out and make room for ships that
did. Hundreds of Americans subsequently
signed an address of thanks to the British
Government for its action. These facts don’t
interest Hollywood,
ON THE SURREY SIDE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Your sickly problem plays might drive a
sober man to booze;
I never seenv to get the hang of these absurd
revues;
The humor of the bedroom farce is hard to
be descried ;
I long for what I used to see upon the
Surrey side.
Let whoso will by Ibsen swear or pay for
Shaw his cash
Or gaze entranced upon the huge and glit-
tering bulk of Asche;
Let baldlieads gloat on feasts o'f limbs that
coryphees provide;
They gave us far more filling fare upon the
Surrey side.
The heroes had no complexes. It went be-
neath their looks,
Their nobleness innate. The crooks were
plain, not fancy crooks.
I see no heroines nowaniglits to match the
girls who’d glide
Through melodramas of my youth upon the
Surrey side.
The hero always weathered through his
scheming foes’ attacks;
The villain always got it where the turkey
gets the axe.
Though Adce might triumph for awhile, its
towel was always skied
Before the curtain hit the stage upon the
Surrey side.
The dramatist was just a plain intelligible
chap
Who dealt with elemental thenves like love
and hate and scrap.
His fighters packed no armaments like movie
champions hide,
They mostly fought with knuckles bare upon
the Surrey side.
Your modern Thespians leave me cold. Their
ways are too abstruse,
Likewise the attitudes they strike, the sen-
timents they loose.
I’d swap the most imposing show these high-
brow coves provide
For half an hour of long ago upon the
Surrey side.

Here’s the Remedy
for Piles —Rexona
The Rapid
i Healer.
mm
“Having to work amongst cattle
and doing a lot of riding on horse-
back, in wet weather, caused me
to suffer with piles. Since using
Rexona Ointment I am completely
cured and in the best of health,
and would strongly advise any-
body to use same, as it will give
relief immediately.”
Mr. CLARE LESLIE FOOT,
Springsure, Queensland.
Rexona Gives Prompt
Relief
Those who suffer from piles are especi-
ally unfortunate in that they cannot talk
about their complaint. They must suffer in
silence.
To all such Rexona comes as a great bless-
ing, for it is easily obtained, easily applied,
and the result is always gratifying.
The distressing symptoms quickly subside,
and mind and body both feel relief from the
constant strain almost after the first applica-
tion. In this Ointment are combined juices
and essences in an entirely new and unique
manner, forming a remedy justly celebrated
as a Rapid Healer.
Rexona is a remedy which is especially
valuable in the treatment of piles. Those
who try it will not be disappointed. Rexona
is sold everywhere at I/O, or in pots holding
four times the quantity for 3/-.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O UN-LOVERS all, the time draws nigh
When we no more shall be
fireside folk, and north-wes| winds
Prom out the Tasman Sea,
Fresh-blowing on our golden coast,
Shall softly call us forth
To wander east, to wander west,
To wander south or north.
Since wondrous is our heritage—■
A continent our home —-
Right glad we’ll be to quit our hearths,
i;ight glad, in truth, to roam
Down winding ways, down radiant ways,
With hearts and eyes enthralled,
Free folk horizontal spaciously,
No longer roofed and wmlled.
No prisoned people set to dwell
In narrowness are we,
But folk who love all amplitude
Of sky and land and sea ;
Wherefore, when blows the north-east wind,
It summons youth and age
To fare abroad that they may know
And prize their heritage.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
Man of Unclean Lips.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MAY be, Doc,” said the mate, “but
for me, I’d as soon make jokes to
a man about his wife going mad
and murdering his babies as about his funny
little go-to-church habits. It’s not a matter
of nice sentiment, either.”
He was braced well back in his bunk,
sucking vigorously at a long-dead pipe. The
ship’s doctor, small and round and rosy,
seemed not at all perturbed by the mate’s
censure, lie lolled comfortable on the settee
and sipped his whisky as if lie loved it. In
this his attitude no way belied him.
“Oh rot!” he answered. “Jimmy can take
a joke all right.”
"May be, may be,” said the mate; “it’s
a funny business, though.”
He put a match to his pipe, but his eyes
were fixed beyond it. The passenger, a much-
travelled one, began rather drowsily to
recite to the doctor tales of other voyages
. on many coasts. There was talk of the great
uncertainties of life, of women and weather
and the queer ways of the sea, as the old
ship grumb’ed along like some sorely battered
animal. It was a comfortle’ss night; a llion-
sand lost souls wailed in the wind; there
was a living menace in the crash and hiss
of suddenly-taken seas; the walls of the little
cabin seemed to bulge and waver with the
straining of the vessel, and a glass tumbler
racketed from side to side in its ill-fitting
socket. The ranging minds of the two
swung a wide compass. They had soon
travelled erratically over half a world and
back again, and still the mate was silent.
And then he spoke, abruptly as a man who
makes up his mind to some sudden disclos-
ure.
“Did you ever hear of the Carlotta, Doc. V”
he asked. “And Grand and MacCarthy? I
don’t often talk about if. but it has a bearing
in a way. And it wasn't so very far from
here that the old packet piled up. Just
sat up on the Big Beef for a while thinking
it over, and then got tired and slipped down
below. She was old for her years, anyhow.
Never saw her, did you? About 3000 tons of
dirt and rust and grime. She’d long fore-
reaching clipper bows that seemed just made
for a hgure-liead, and a fat stern that rat
her well down on the water like some blows>
old charlady sitting back on her hunkers for
a breather. She’d a whine and a grunt to
her engines, too, that reminded you more
than ever of an asthmatic old lady, and she
walked over any sea with a sort of drunken,
rheumaticy waddle. But shipping as third
on her looked good in those days, and I
was quite fond of the old girl before the
finish
“MacCarthy was mate and Grand master
of her, and had been for some time before
I joined her. You must have heard of them.
Everybody in the Straits knew them. Gog
and Magog they were called, sometimes.
Great, hefty, blonde beggars, both of them,
and the most astonishing likeness you ever
saw! I’ve met a few doubles before and
since, but never any like that pair. Living
twins they were, for face and size and shape.
I remember that first afternoon when I went
on board with my kit. I’d met Grand at the
agent’s; and when I saw him leaning over
the rails in his shirt-sleeves I went up to
report. But it was MacCarthy, as I soon
found out. He’d just got asi far as ‘Thanks
for the compliment, sonnie, but I’m only the
mate,’ when Grand stepped out of his cabin.
And then the resemblance hit me right
between the eyes.
“It ended on the surface, though. A
writer johnnie in Singapore once made
poetry about them in a Straits paper. I’ve
always remembered the first verse of it: —
Two men there were of strong sea breed,
Alike as peas in pod;
And one knew nought of doubt or creed,
But one knew all of God.
That was true enough, too. The old
man was a real pillar of the church,
as they call ’em —lay-preacher, and all that
ashore, you know, and a thorough, good-
living Christian. Never did seem to belong
to the sea, somehow.
“That was Grand. MacCarthy—-well, Mac
was a bad-living Irishman. Not in a mean
way, mind. There were few more likeable
men to be met, but his life was one long-
riot. as far as women and whisky went, and
he’d a sink of a mouth, even for a sailorman
I’ve seen a hard-bitten bos’n blush when Mac
was talking at his best. And that made it
harder to understand the friendship between
Ihe two, for good pals they were, and had
been for years before I struck them. It was
a wonderful thing to see the restraint that
MacCarthy put on his tongue and his habits
whenever the old man was likely to notice.
And there was no fear or favor about it,
mind, but just human respect for the other’s
religious feelings.
“But it was Mac’s tongue in tlie end that
started the trouble, with a quart two ol
whisky and a stinking Singapore night as
accessories before the fact. We’d a roving
cargo-cadging commission in and about the
Straits to China and Australia with an occa-
sional cut-off with a load of coolies for the
phosphate islands. The Carlotta was a happy
home; but she’d been leaning wearily against
the wharf for a matter of five days or so
when it happened. It was about ten o clock
of the sort of night that a man hates his
neighbor promiscuously for coming within
fifty feet of him. MacCarthy was finishing
off a mixed alcoholic day with long whisky-
pegs in the palm court of the Europe, lie
didn’t remember what he and his drunken
cronies’had been talking about, but he knew
it had been pretty loud and pretty loose.
I could imagine without telling the purple-
ness and general blasphemy of Mac’s talk at
such a time of such a day.
“Anyhow, he said he felt the first bit of
a cold shiver he’d known for weeks when he
started to leave and saw that Grand and
some of his most respectable friends had
been sitting within a few feet of them, quite
hidden by the big palms, but well within
hearing distance. Mac told me he could have
torn his tongue out when he saw the hurt
look ou the Old Man’s face, lie would have
slunk by, but Grand stopped him. The Devil
himself must have done the prompting.
Grand’s rebuke was quite good-natured, and
he probably meant well, but I can easily
imagine what smug Sunday-school ma’ams he
and his proper friends must have seemed to
MacCarthy at the moment. And Mac was
feeling so damned sorry about it all that
that helped to make him angry, too.
“It was such a silly business, the whole of
it, and no one more sorry for the stupid blas-
phemy than MacCarthy when lie found him-
self outside feeling sick and fairly sober. He
couldn’t forget the way the Old Man had
winced as from an unexpected slap in the
face. He spent the rest of the night wait-
ing about to tell Grand how sorry he was.
They cam e back to the boat together fairly
late, and they were both very quiet. Grand
had said, ‘That’s all right, Mr. MacCarthy,
but his voice was cold. We lay there a week
longer and I guarantee that it was the sorri-
est week Mac ever put in at a port. It
wasn't that the old man did anything. If he d
stormed at the mate or tried to ‘save’ him
or sack him or kill him, Mac said he wouldn I
have minded so much. But Grand did no-
thing. He just went, about like a sort
of conscious martyr, treating everyone
politely, and MacCarthy extra so, all the
time with that hurt look on liis face. In
fact, he acted for all the world like a sulky
kid.
“Matters weren’t helped much by that
woman on the day we were leaving. She
was a friend of MacCarthy’s, all right, but
it was no fault of his. Nor of hers, for that
matter. Even if she hadn’t been half drunk
the extraordinary resemblance of the two
was excuse enough. It was at Baffles in the
late afternoon. All the best people about,
you know. She threw her arms round
Grand’s neck, called him ‘Duckie’ and began
to reprove him for not coming to see her as
he’d promised. And Lord knows every line
and word of her shrieked what she was.
Before Grand could get away she’d fallen
into some pink and maudlin tales of scandal-
ous times they’d had together. The whole
show was a distinct hit, but —no, it didn t
improve things at all.
“That trip to Hongkong was uncomfort-
able. It was so childish as to be laughable,
only it wasn’t funny. Lord, no, it wasn’t
funny! From being coldly polite to Mae-
Carthy the Old Man took to practically ignor-
ing him. Grand never spoke to the mate
directly. Even if Mac was in the saloon
with him he passed on his orders through a
third person. I tell you it gave you the hor-
rors to have him say to you, ‘Tell the chief
officer so and so,’ with Mac himself standing
there right alongside you. It wouldn’t have
mattered so much if he had kept to him-
self. but he seemed to go out of his way to
be near MacCarthy. And he was always
watching the man, just sitting and looking at
him in a dazed and fascinated sort of way.
Many times during the mate’s watch he'd
stay up on the bridge for half an hour or
more, not bothering about -the course or any-
thing, but just staring at MacCarthy. And
what he had to say there he’d pass on
through the quartermaster at the wheel.
“Poor old Mac got to have the scared,
worried look of an ill-treated mongrel.
Though big and bluff aud blustering he was
absurdly sensitive, like many Irishmen, and
the Old Man could hardly have hit on a
better line of persecution. With anyone
else I think Mac would have blown up early,
even if it had meant the loss of his ticket;
but there’d been a very real friendship
between these two, and for a long time he
just bottled it all up and went on being
dam’ sorry for the whole show. But the
Old Man’s attitude began to tell on him.
He was turning nervy and morose. He
snarled where he would have laughed, and
the profanity he used had lost the old
healthy ring. Mind you, there’s cursing and
cursing, and Mac’s was becoming the mean
and nasty sort, which it never had been.
And he was not so careful now about the
Old Man overhearing him. All the time
Grand went on watching him, just watching
him with that hurt and surprised and expect-
ant look on his face. What he was expect-
ing the Lord knows, but it looked as if he’d
find it all right if things went on.
“By the time we reached the hill-climbing
city MacCarthy was ready to tear things
to pieces, and did. And he didn’t bother
to keep it quiet now. If anything, he adver
tised it. He even played on his likeness
to Grand to work off an ugly joke or two.
Drabs of the waterfront hailed the Old Man
as a brother ; the keeper of a pretty low dive
approached him on the matter of compen-
sation for smashed furniture, aud so on.
The affair soon became the joke of the place.
“And then Mac cleared out altogether. He
came to say good-bye to us—said he couldn’t
stick it. Grand did nothing beyond telling
one of us to carry on. On sailing day he
said coldly, ‘Mr. MacCarthy knows the time
we leave. I shall try to make arrangements.
If necessary, I’ll take the mate’s watch
myself.’
“Mac didn’t show up. and after some
trouble with the port authorities we cleared

Heed that
Backache!
Too often it indicates kidney weakness
risk kidney breakdown? Those pains in
the back, dizzy attacks, rheumatic twinges,
and annoying bladder irregularities warn you of
kidney weakness. Never neglect such symptoms;
they are often the start of stone formation; in-
flamed bladder, rheumatism, dropsy, sciatica or
lumbago. Be healthy! Strengthen the weakened
kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Thousands owe their good health to the curative
and preventive properties of this kidney medicine.
SYDNEY MAN TELLS HIS STORY.
Mr. H. Holder, No. 12 Hector Road, Willoughby, Sydney, says:
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are indeed a wonderful kidney
medicine. I have proved this. For a long time I suffered agony
from backache and kidney trouble, and only those who have been
afflicted in this way have any idea what I went through. My limbs
swelled considerably, the kidney secretions were thick and cloudy
with a red sediment, and I had agonising pains in u.y back. 1 was
treated by a doctor, and tried all sorts of remedies, but nothing gave
me the slightest relief. I was naturally very worried about the
serious state of m.v health, and when Doan's Backache Kidney Pills
were brought under ray notice I decided to try them. It was a
grand thing for me that 1 got this remedy, for seven bottles cured
me completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan’s Pills and
recommend them with every confidence to other sufferers.”
Mr. H. Holder, No. 12 Hector Road, Willoughby, Sydney, says:
“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are indeed a wonderful kidney
Eight years later, Mr. Holder says: "I have still the same good
opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured me of
kidney disorder eight years ago, and I have had no return of the
complaint since.”

TWO RESIDENTS OF SYDNEY CURED OF
PILES BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
A WOMAN’S CASE.
Mrs. A. Craw, 31 Reserve Street,
Annandale, Sydney, says: “About two
years ago I used Doan’s Oiintment for
a bad attack of piles, and I am
pleased to tell you that it cured me,
and I have had no return of that dis-
tressing complain since. I suffered
terribly before I used Doans Oint-
ment, the pain and irritation being
often very trying. Different prepara-
tions I used failed to give me any
relief, but Doan’s Ointment soon fixed
me up. and I am very glad to have
an opportunity of saying a few words
in praise of this fine pile remedy. I
always keep a tin in the house now,
and find it very useful at times.’
Doan's Ointment is sold by all
chemists and storekeepers. hoster-
McClellan Co., Proprietors, 15 Hamil-
ton Street, Sydney.
But, be sure you get DOAN’S.
A MAN’S CASE.
Mr. Isaac Swales, 89 Fitzroy Street,
Moore Park, Sydney, says: “I used
remedy after remedy trying to get a
cure for itching piles, but nothing did
me any good until I applied Doan’s
'Ointment. This wonderful ointment
cured me in a very short time, and I
have been free from the torture of this
complaint ever since. Only those who
are tortured with piles know what the
irritation is like, but, after my experi-
ence with Doan’s Ointment. I am sure
no one need suffer with piles. I wish
I had known about this remedy years
before; it would have saved me a lot
of trouble.”
Twelve years later, Mrs. Swales
says : “My husband’s cure has proved
a permanent one. He has been free
from piles for the past twelve years.”

a couple of hours late. It was only reason-
able to expect that the Old Man would cheer
up with the going of MacCarthy, but he didn’t,
lie said little or nothing to anyone, and
that martyred look was again set steady on
his face. Worst of all, he was watching
once more, always watching for something.
Time and again I found him in the little
saloon, idle and ugly-looking, with his eyes
fixed on MacCarthy's seat. There was a
curious, intent stare in them that somehow
made the skin crawl over your back. lie
wasn’t looking through or past the seat as
one might when thinking hard, but directly
at it as if he saw something there, some-
thing that interested and puzzled him. And
while he was talking to you his eyes would
keep switching back to it.
“It was a relief when he took to spending
hours alone in his own quarters. He soon
had most of his meals there, too; but the
feel of the man, that brooding, watching
spirit, was heavy on the ship, and even
away from him the second and I found our-
selves talking in depressed whispers. I had
a queer feeling that the stillness around was
a solid wall that completely shut out the
world and all clean and ordinary things.
There was not much happy home about the
Carlotta those days. Grand spent more and
more of his time in his cabin. Soon he
seldom left it except for his trick on the
bridge and the noon sights. Passing it at
times I heard an uncanny muttering, mostly
a confused jumble as if someone were pat-
tering endless prayers.
“We put in to Manila, and if ever I felt
like jumping a ship it was there. The whole
business was getting badly on my nerves.
However, we sailed within twenty-four hours
for Brisbane direct, and all the queerness was
on again. Grand still kept the mate’s
watch. There was no single thing to fasten
on against him. He gave his orders clearly,
and what little else he had to say was sane
and quiet enough. But there was always
that ugly, brooding thing in him that made
me glad I saw no more of him. At all
sorts of odd night hours we heard him mov-
ing restlessly about his cabin or bigger
sitting-room, and the light in one or the
other was never out. And always now when
we passed was that confounded muttering.
“About the fifth day out a sudden mania
for more speed seized him, and he started
to send urgent messages to the engine-room.
McCann, the chief, came to us all but weep-
ing with rage. He had been to see Grand,
but all to be got from him was ‘Yes, that’s
all right. Mr. McCann; but push her a bit
more, will you?’
“One night as I passed his open port I
heard the usual muttering going on inside.
The curtain was drawn, but barely reached
the lower rim of the port, and shifted enough
to give every now and then a view of the
cabin. Grand was sitting at the small built-
in desk. With a big jagged piece of glass
he was scratching away methodically at a
photograph that lay before him. By tip-
toeing right up against the port I could see
that it was one of MacCarthy that I remem-
bered hanging on the wall of the cabin. The
face was scratched and scored beyond recog-
nition. Then he swung around so quickly
in his chair that I thought he’d realised I
was watching. But it was at a settee beside
him, an empty settee, that he was staring,
and he said in a matter-of-fact way, ‘You
sec I’ve got to do it, don’t you? There’s no
other way. If only it wouldn’t bleed 50’....
“For a while he mumbled on unintelli-
gibly ; then suddenly he stood upright and
flung his hands above his head and cried
out in a sort of wail, ‘ln Thine image, O
Lord! A man of unclean lips! Plaything
of harlots! In Thine image, Lord !’ And
he collapsed again on the chair and his head
dropped on his hands, and I could just hear
him muttering, ‘lf it would only stop bleed-
ing. ... stop bleeding’ ”....
The mate fell silent, fumbling at his pipe.
The sound of the wind had dropped to a
steady moaning. The dirty brown stuff of
the curtain across the doorway swayed regu-
larly and slowly until some intruding gust
from the night outside slid down the little
alleyway and billowed it sharply back like
a sudden hand-thrust. The head of the
little doctor twisted quickly toward it and
then back to the teller of the tale. “Go on,
man,” he said irritably.
The mate continued, knocking his pipe
against his heel: “I went after the second.
The night was hot and still, the dull calm
that falls in these latitudes between the s.-e.
and the n.-w. weather; the sky and th e big
stars seemed to have dropped low over the
sea, pressing right down on us, and the
thump of the Carlotta’s engines was like the
heavy beat of a heart struggling against
suffocation. But I felt chilly as if an un-
accountable cold wind had blown on me.
“There was a hardly noticeable jar when
w e hit the reef, but she listed wildly to port,
and with that came an ominous straining
and rending. The deck seemed to squirm
and twist under my feet. There was plenty
to do, and it was some time before I missed
Grand. The first boats had already left,
for it was soon evident that there was no
hope for the Carlotta; she was shifting
badly when I went back to look for him.
His door was locked, but the port was open,
and through it I saw that he was still in
the chair before his desk. In front of him
stood the mutilated photograph of Mac-
Carthy. In his hand was the jagged piece
of glass. Then he turned his head—and I
felt sick. Great bloody gashes scored his
face vertically from forehead to chin in
much the same way as the marks on that
photograph. His face was a horrible, shape-
less mess of blood and hanging flesh.
“I shrieked at him. but he took no notice.
I hammered and kicked at his door. Back
at the small port I yelled and sobbed at
him.
“And then I was quiet with the horror
of it. That bloody mask was moving ludi-
crously. For a moment the white teeth
showed. Grand was talking and I could just
hear one or two of the muttered words:
‘.... this fouled image.... eye offend thee
.... servant, Lord !’ ”
Once more the mate knocked his pipe
slowly and methodically against his heel.
The hand that held it was shaking a little
and for a moment his eyes were closed.
“A Jap tramp picked us up,” he went on.
All but Grand. Landed us four days later
in Brisbane. Oh, yes. I know what you’re
going to say, Doc—religious mania and what-
not. And, of course, you’re right. Did I
tell you, though, that I’d never known a
finer or saner chap than Grand was before
that night in Singapore?”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE shadow lay long over the valley
when Oyster Parkes came back from
the township. His eye took in the
humpy with the ragged bark roof, the yard
strewn with bark and chips, with here and
there the blackened marks of fire where leaves
and rubbish had been burned, the post-and-
rail fence, still yellow, around the half-acre of
corn and the few roods of cleared ground
beyond, where the fallen timber still lay in
disorderly heaps. The big man strode along
the narrow bush track deep in thought. It
was not for nothing that lie had been called
Oyster. Silence in the presence of other men
was habitual with him. He never gave an
opinion nor sought one. Even when asked
a question he preferred to use as few words
as possible in his reply and to eke out his
meaning with gestures. But when alone with
the trees his tongue was often loosed. He
said things to the spotted gums and the grey
thrushes which he would never have said
to a human companion.
Now at the turn of the track lie threw
the heavy bag of provisions he carried from
his shoulders and sat down on a stump.
Mechanically his hands worked with knife and
tobacco, while lie held the pipe wrong side up
in liic ceetli and his eyes wandered far away.
“No more of this,” he said. “She’ll be
gla« of that. A change’ll do her good.
Chop, chop, chop from morning to night
for eighteen months and then only this.
What’s it worth, anyhow? A man might as
well be in gaol. She’ll be glad when I tell her.”
Pie had still a quarter of a mile to go to
reach the humpy, but his operations were
leisuesly. Slowly he rubbed the tobacco be-
tween his palms, very slowly he filled his pipe.
“She’ll be glad,” he said again.
The long shadow had slowly crossed the
valley and now only a narrow line of golden
light lay on the distant treetops. Very
slowly Oyster Parkes hoisted the heavy bag
to his shoulder and began to tramp down to
the clearing. Kookaburras were laughing
in the nearer trees. The dry twigs crackled
under his large boots.
“She’ll be glad,” he repeated as he passed
the big red-gum which spread almost to his
clearing.
At the sliprails he gave a shrill whistle
and paused as if waiting for an answer.
“Queer thing that,” he muttered. “She
can generally hear a man when he comes
home.” He dropped the bag over the rails and
climbed after it. The place seemed unnatu-
rally quiet.
“Susan,” he called as he came near the
humpy. There was no answer.
“Queer,” he repeated. “She can generally
hear a man.”
The door of the humpy stood wide open.
A clean kerosene-tin of water had been
placed near it. Within, the rough table, still
bearing the marks of the adze, had been
scrubbed to whiteness. A billy hung over
the dead fire, but kindling-wood had been
piled up neatly near the hearth. All was as
clean and orderly as if the occupant had left
it only a moment before.
“Susan,” said Oyster Parkes in a hoarse
whisper, as lie stooped in the low doorway.
There was still no reply, and it was evident
that the humpy was empty.
The man went out again and called tin
name. He called it twelve times in a voice
that must have penetrated far into the
thickest scrubs.
“She wouldn’t go bush,” he muttered, “and
there’s no place else she can be.”
Wearily he returned to the humpy. He
lighted a small lamp and put it on the table.
Then he sat for a while with his head in his
hands.
“She couldn’t have gone over to Smith’s,”
he told himself; “she don’t like them women,
Last time she was there with me she come
near having a row with them.”
After another period of thought he spoke
again.
“She couldn’t have gone away with another
man, for she don’t know no other men—not
well enough to matter, anyhow. If she’s
playing me a lark I’ll talk to her, but it ain't
like her to do it.”
It was now quite dark outside. Oyster
Parkes stooped down and slowly laid and
kindled the fire. The bright flames leaped
round the billy and cheerful sparkles went
up the chimney. The man made tea and put
corned-beef and bread on the table.
“What’s the use of eating?” he said as he
cut half a dozen thick slices from the beef.
“What’s the use of eating when a man’s all
alone? And I thought she would be glad to
know.” He ate hungrily, drank a great
quantity of tea and lighted his pipe.
“Susan wouldn’t leave me,” he said;
“she wouldn’t play me no tricks. She ain't
no ordinary female in them respects. She's
been murdered, that’s what she has. She’s
been murdered!”
He brought his large red fist down on the
table in. a way that made the corned beef jump.
Outside a mopoke called and a log on the
fire sent up a sudden shower of sparks.
“Murdered!” he said again, and stood up,
hands clenched, drawing fiercely at his pipe.
He lighted a candle in a bottle from which
the bottom had been broken, and with his
improvised lantern went out into the dark-
ness. Long he searched the track, the yard
and the new clearing.
“It might have been a snakebite,” he mut-
tered, “and her going off to Smith’s for help.”
The candle had burned down to the last
quarter of an inch when he returned heavily
to the humpy.
“She’s gone!” he said. “That’s all there
is to it. Gone! And me thinking she would
be glad to know.”
He pulled off his boots and threw himself
down on the bunk.
“Susan,” he murmured, and a moment
later the air quivered to a loud snore.
Morning and the dying lamp-light
struggled together in the open door of the
humpy. Oyster Farkes moved uneasily in
his sleep.
“Susan,” lie groaned.
At the word a soft pink head was thrust
against his hairy cheek.
• “You!” he cried, grasping the galah by
the feet. “You, Susan! You did give a
cove a fright. Susan, I’ve sold this damn
selection that ain’t no good to us to a couple
of Pommy chaps. You and me’s going to
town for a spell. Ain’t you glad, old bird?”
