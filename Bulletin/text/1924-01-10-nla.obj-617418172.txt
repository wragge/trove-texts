Omar Khayyam, the Mystic
The title may bring a smile to the lips
of those who regard this poet merely as a
pessimistic old winebibber. Yet one often
hears it said, “Every now and then you
come across passages in Omar which make
you think that he means more than he says,
yet when you try to find out just what he
does mean you are baffled.” This is because
these readers know their Omar only from
the Fitzgerald translation. And it is hardly
correct to regard Fitzgerald’s work as a
translation at all. lie gives us 107 quat-
rains. Of these only 49 are actual transla-
tions of single quatrains 44 are compacted
from more than one verse of the original;
2 are from quatrains found in the text of
only one translator; 2 reflect what may be
called the composite spirit of the whole ;
2 were influenced by the Odes of Hafiz ; and
3, which appear in the first and second edi-
tions —those most widely read —do not seem
to be traceable to any lines in the original
text, and were withdrawn by Fitzgerald from
the latest editions. Apart from the signifi-
cance of this analysis, it is important to
remember that the Persian quatrain is
always an isolated verse-form. The mean-
ing is complete in the four lines, and there
is practically never any connection between
quatrain and quatrain. Something more
than mere translation has, therefore, been
necessary to produce such a homogeneous
work of art as Edward Fitzgerald’s.
Of the numerous translators of Omar
three stand out above all the rest. The
first, from the point of view of artistry as
well as popularity, is Edward Fitzgerald;
the second is Whinfield; the third the
Frenchman, Nicholas, formerly French Con-
sul at Resht. These three have given us
three distinct personalities. That of Fitzgerald
is a pessimistic but good-hearted old wine-
bibber ; that of Whinfield a strangely fas-
cinating mixture of aspirant and sinner;
Nicholas’s is the pure mystic. How are
we to judge between them ? Let us hear
what Fitzgerald has to say on the subject:
As there is some traditional presumption, and
certainly the opinion of some learned men in
favor of Omar’s being a Sufi and even something of
a Saint, those who please may so interpret his
Wine and Cup-bearer. On the other hand, as there
is far more historical certainty of his being a philoso-
pher, of scientific insight and ability far beyond
that of the age and country he lived in; of such
moderate worldly ambition as becomes a philosopher,
and such moderate wants as rarely satisfy a debau-
chee ; other readers may be content to believe with
me that, while the wine Omar celebrates is simply
the juice of the grape, he bragged more than he
drank of it, in very defiance, perhaps, of that spiritual
wine which left its votaries sunk in hypocrisy or
disgust.
There is no doubt, therefore, that Fitz-
gerald placed no mystical interpretation
upon Omar’s quatrains, and if we find an
such meaning seeking to reveal itself throug i
his verses, we must regard it either as aris
ing accidentally from Omar’s more or les
satirical use of certain well-known phrases
or conclude that Omar intended the deepe
meaning, and that Fitzgerald, in spite of hi
disbelief in it, did not succeed in wholly
burying it beneath his own materialistic in
terpretation.
As regards Nicholas’s attempt to make o:i
Omar an unadulterated mystic, this seem
to me as far from the truth as Fitzgerald’
acceptation of the materialistic “wine.’
Wherever such words as “wine,” “wine
bearer.” etc., appear in the text, Nicholas
carefully annotates “Dieu,” “La Divinite,’
etc. In refutation of Fitzgerald’s view we
might take such verses as the following
translated by Whinfield :
The Drop wept for his severance from the Sea.
But the Sea smiled; for “I am AH,’’ said He;
Yea, God is all in all; there’s none beside,
But one point circling seems plurality!
which is a clear and definite statement o:'
the Sufi teaching of the One Life. On the
other hand, we might refute Nicholas with
such obvious buffoonery as the following;—
So many cups of wine will I consume,
Its bouquet shall exhale from out my tomb,
And everyone that passes by shall halt,
And reel and stagger with that mighty fume.
There still remains for us to consider the
more moderate view of Whinfield. This
commentator shows us that Omar was thor
oughly grounded in theology in his youth
and that he “carried away from this teach
ing the firm conviction of the existence of
the One God, the Omnipresent Power. He
classifies the quatrains into those which
complain of the unsatisfactoriness of morta'
experience; those which are sceptical anc
rebellious; those which embody the “eat
drink and be merry” attitude; those which
are mystical and religious; love-poems, many
of them capable of a mystical interpreta-
tion ; satires; finally, “quatrains which are
didactic and gnomic.”
In the Orient the language of symbolism
is very definite and clearly defined. It
reached its height among the Sufis. “What
rose do you wear?” is the occult form of
asking “To what school of mysticism do
you belong?” The red rose is the symbol
of sorrow, the white rose that of joy, the
yellow rose is the symbol of mystic union
with the divine. “Only the bird of the morn-
ing [the mystic] knoweth the worth of the
book of the rose; for not everyone who read-
eth the page understandeth the meaning,”
said Hafiz. The rose-thorn is pain, degrada-
tion. And Omar says:—
If roses fail, I’ll deck me with the thorn!
And welcome darkness if of light forlorn;
And if I lose my prayer-mats, beads and Shaikh,
Those Christian bells and stoles I will not scorn.
Dante knew the symbolism of the rose:—•
If the lowest step gathereth so large a light
within itself, what then the amplitude of the rose’s
outmost petals ? Within the yellow of the Eternal
Rose....me Beatrice drew.
The saintly host displayed itself to Dante
in the form of a white rose. The rosary
itself is a garland of many-colored roses
symbolising the joys and sorrows of life and
the aspirations of the devotee. As Beatrice
drew Dante “within the yellow of the Eter-
nal Rose,” he realised the joy of complete
union. When this stage is reached there is
no more “me” and “thee.” The sense of
separateness has been transcended.
Some little talk awhile of me and thee
There was —and then no more of thee and me,
says Omar. This refers not to the transi-
toriness of life, but to the Sufi dream of ulti-
mate union with the divine:—
And this I know: whether the one True Light
Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite,
One flash of it within the Tavern caught
Better than in the Temple lost outright.
That is, one glimpse of the True Light
caught in the tavern, “even though it slay,”
were better than a life of religious austerity
into which the heart does not enter. There
is a significant stanza (211) in the Whin-
field translation which I cannot find in
Fitzgerald:—
Death’s terrors spring from baseless phantasy;
Death yields the tree of Immortality;
Since Isa breathed new life into my soul,
Eternal death has washed its hands of me.
Isa is the Persian name for Jesus. Again
he pleads:—
Lord, I am weary of my nothingness,
My wretchedness and empty-handedness ;
Thou makest non-existent things to be,
To thine own Being raise my nothingness!
In Stanza 236 (Whinfield) he speaks of the
One Life manifesting through countless
forms:—
The very Wine a myriad forms sustains,
And to take shape of plants and creatures deigns;
But deem not that its essence ever dies;
Its forms may perish, but its Self remains.
Stanza 222 (Whinfield) reads: —
Once and again my soul did me implore,
To teach her, if I might, the mystic lore;
I bade her Alif learn, and naught beside.
Who knows that letter well need learn no more.
Alif is the first letter of the alphabet—-
Alpha, the beginning and source of all; in
Sufi language, the underlying truth. It is
interesting to compare Fitzgerald’s transla-
tion of the same quatrain :
I sent my Soul through the Invisible,
Some letter of that after-life to spell;
And by and by my soul returned to me
And answered, “I myself am Heaven and Hell.’*
There are too many purely mystical stan-
zas for quotation, but those already given
will show that any view of Omar which
the mystic side of his character is
incomplete. It is equally certain that he
was apt to take a malicious delight in shock-
ing the Sufi “wowser.” Welling up through
all his doubts and his difficulties, there seems
to have been a strain of the purest mysti-
cism, hidden at times by the result of his
own excesses, either emotional or sensuous;
a man w*ho could glimpse the highest, though
he could not attain to it.

Broader Efficiency
The discussion as to whether we have too
much or too little education requires clari-
fying with a definition or two. There can
be no doubt that too much of the energy of
young Australia is diverted towards over-
crowded professions; but if by education we
mean the lifelong study, beginning in an
ordered way, which continually widens the
outlook upon life and the world, then any
suggestion that we have too much of it must
be taken as 1 a self-satisfied assertion that
humanity has attained its summit of mental
endeavor and requires to go no farther.
To begin with, the general assumption
that because we have primary schools and
daily newspapers we are an educated people
is ridiculous. Our general level of culture is
not only not higher than that of the people in
the time of Elizabeth, who paid threepence
to be allowed to stand for five and a half
hours in the theatre to see “Hamlet” played
without scenery, but we should be hard put
to it to show that it is higher than that of
the city of Toulouse in the twelfth century;
and certainly we fail by comparison with the
Athens of the time of Pericles in our general
appreciation of the best things. It is true
that ancient and modern comparisons are
apt to be unfair, in that we exclude the anci-
ent slave population, which really corres-
ponds to the great bulk of our own less
educated masses; but, comparing the people
of opportunity to-day with the people of op-
portunity yesterday, the result is not encour-
aging. In the “Notebook of a Spinster
Lady” there is the report of a conversation
with King Edward, then Prince of Wales.
“Reading!” said the Prince. “Now, that is
a thing I never could do.” Yet the last
Saxon queen was well versed in Latin and
logic; and Queen Elizabeth could bend her
stiff collar of lace sufficiently to read Greek.
On the face of it, the progress of general
education would not seem to be so striking.
But in answer to all this we arc assured
that these are the days of specialism and
efficiency, and that men are now educated to
do the practical work of the world better
than ever before. Again, history seems to
throw some doubt on the matter. Efficiency
is no new thing. It was the particular and
especial quality of the leading Romans over
a long period. Take the known instance
of the strangely-efficient Julius Caesar.
While conducting his great military cam-
paigns in Gaul, fighting by rule and system
against overwhelming odds and almost over-
mastering bravery, he led his troops into
winter quarters every year and hurried to
exercise his authority as chief 1 judge and
administrator in his large province, extend-
ing from northern Italy far down into what
is now Jugo-Slavia. Fresh from his ter-
rific battles with the Gauls, this Roman took
up his job of faithfully administering the
difficult Roman law, and dealing with thou-
sands of cases which had accumulated in the
courts. Not only did he do this, but he also
undertook the task of organising the Roman
system in remote parts. At the same time
he was playing, through his emissaries, a
leading part in home politics and dealing with
his huge and growing finances—he was many
times a millionaire. Between times he read
Greek classics, which he loved; and collected
pearls as a hobby. Admitting that this
amazing efficiency on the part of the “noblest
Roman of them all” was phenomenal, the
fact yet remains that Roman education
aimed at producing just such men of affairs,
and did produce dozens only a little less effi-
cient than Ca'sar himself. By comparison
the modern efficient person is not so very
remarkable. There is, of course, nothing
at all to be said against training a man to
do his job properly, or training a man to do

Nothing ever worries him!
This sort of thing goes
on all day!
He is a busy man, and
from the time he arrives
at the office in the morning
until he leaves at night he
is besieged by his staff, by
callers, by ’phone in-
quirers. Frequently he is
expected to do half a
dozen things at once.
But does he get
worried ?
Not a bit of it! He
breezes in every morning
whistling, shouts a cheery
greeting to everyone and
tackles the day’s work
with a vigorous energy
and cheery self-confidence
that all the worries of an
arduous day fail to dispel.
His grip of things never
relaxes, and at the close of
the afternoon he is just as
alert and clear-minded as
he was at 9 o’clock.
He has been like that
for six months now —ever
since he first enlisted in
the Army of Kruschen
Optimists. Regularly he
takes his little daily dose
—as much of the magic
Salts as will lie on a six-
pence, in is first cup of
tea.
He can’t taste it—but
what a difference i t
makes!
Ail those bodily ills that
befog the brain and irri-
tate the temper —head-
aches, constipation, list-
lessness, etc. —disappear,
to be replaced by a won-
derful feeling of happi-
ness, of contentment, of
alertness and brightness
of brain and body—in
brief, the well-known
“Kruschen feeling.” The
man who has adopted the
Kruschen habit is able to
get through any amount
of work without the least
muddle, for his clear mind,
bright outlook and tireless
energy all make for con-
centration.
Try it. Learn now the
habit of the daily dose.
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in your
breakfast cup as will
lie on a sixpence.
It’s the little daily
dose that does it.
Krfllts
Good Health for a Farthing a Day.
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
just the right amount for a most
invigorating daily tonic. The medi-
cinal dose for persons suffering
from pains of rheumatism and gout,
or habitual constipation, with in-
active liver, etc., is half to one tea-
spoonful in a tumbler of hot water
before breakfast.
Every chemist sells Kruschen
Salts; one bottle contains 96 morn-
ing “pinches”—enough to last three
months. Get a bottle to-day.

such a training up as an educational ideal.

educated at all in the broader human sense.
It is a comparatively rare thing in Australia
to discover a lawyer, doctor or schoolmaster
who would have been classed as an educated
man 60 years ago. They may or may not
be efficient at a particular job, but outside
that they have little learning and still less
feeling for learning. The professional men
have, in fact, become tradesmen, with a
tradesman’s outlook upon life, the wage being
generally more important than the task —
and the tip for the races more important
than either.
But to say that those arc the best pro-
ducts of the modern movement towards effi-
ciency would be unfair. They are not the
best product, but the average which the move-
ment strikes ; for the deadly sin of the cry
for efficiency is that it has a definite aim, and
so imposes practical limitations on that which
should be limitless. When Caesar has learned
the arts of politics and war and finance, and
administration of law, and knows the Greek
classics—when he has attained real profici-
ency and mastery in all these, then it is
quite in keeping that he should turn his
attention to pearls and become the expert of
his age in yet another field. Specialism
may be very necessary, but specialism as a
dead end and finish may easily mean a nar-
rowing of life all round. A doctor might
not be any better able to cure the sick for
a knowledge of the Elizabethan drama; but
he is a larger man for that knowledge, and
medical science can lose nothing by being
in the hands of larger men. Plainly, the
evolution of the race is on the mental plane;
in as far as the physical aids or stimulates the
mental growth it must be considered, but no
farther. Economics, practical sciences and
most of the stock-in-trade of our modern
time have only an indirect bearing on the
further mental evolution of man. A true
education gives man a larger world outside
the world of daily utility, and his growth is
proportional to the extent to which he makes
use of the keys of entrance to that larger
world. The tendency, however, is to close
and bar all the main doors to that world and
then to seek entrance to it by various gaps
in the fences or holes in the wall —as witness
our philosophic fiction and some of our more
awful attempts at public entertainment.
Urged on the most attractive of human
grounds, higher and more elastic educational
standards are needed, because in that direc-
tion lie the widest fields of pleasure known
to man. A true Epicurean philosophy for our
time might well be: Pleasure is the only
good; but pleasure is only to be maintained
by increasing the capacity for enjoyment.
And the first step towards a fuller enjoy-
ment of life must be an ever-broadening and
-deepening feeling for education.
D. M. W.
Where Ignorance Is Wise
Upon every occasion when I have dis-
cussed music with a musician I have been
told that, as I did not understand music, I
had no right to an opinion. So it was to be
expected that Mr. Wunderlich, “a non-profes-
sional musician,” should be very painstaking
and somewhat pained in pointing out the
error of my ways (R.P. 22/11/’23). lie
mentions my ignorance, but the ignorance he
imputes and I profess is an ignorance of the
technical structure of music only. Now, I
have discussed the plastic arts with very
capable artists, but none of them have ever
told me that to appreciate a landscape I must
understand the technique of painting. I have
not yet been told that to appreciate a good
play I must understand its construction. I
have yet to hear of the poet who insists upon
liis verse being discussed in terms of iambus
and trochee. But with music all is different,
and I am told that 1 should be modest as
befits my ignorance. In music and in music
alone this knowledge of technicalities is held
to be the only charm that will part the magic
curtains and reveal the hidden beauty. Why
should this be? What is the purpose of all
this elaborate theme and counter-theme ? Is
not the sound made by the finished composi-
tion when it is rendered the only legitimate
justification possible? And is a training in
musical technique necessary to judge or
appreciate that sound?
This error on the part of our musicians is
accounted for by Mr. Wunderlich in one
sentence. “It is not the theme itself but
the way it is expressed that constitutes the
art.” But he is betrayed into attempting to
adorn his fallacy with the crown of Shak-
speare’s fame, stating that Shakspeare
thought so little of themes that he borrowed
them. He could not have chosen a more
unfortunate example. In Shakspeare’s best
work he did not borrow his theme. He bor-
rowed his subject matter. The themes are
his own, torn from his great soul with very
little thought of their mode of expression or
of their technical form. The plays are great
just because the theme in each case is great
—a more than human passion; a transcen-
dent love ; an implacable malice ; human souls
struggling through a world of turmoil amidst
a turmoil of emotion. There is no evidence
that Shakspeare gave any thought to form
or had any training in dramatic construction.
Music composed to-day with the indifference
to technique that was Shakspeare’s would be
hurled to obscurity by the modern patrons
of classical music.
Pope typifies completely the over-lords of
our musical world. Pope did borrow his
themes because to him the theme was nothing,
the mode of expression everything. There-
fore his art was not art but artistry, art’s
bastard brother. Pope and Dryden did con-
tend that a knowledge of the technique of
poetry was essential to its appreciation.
Only by centring the attention upon these
trivialities could one find any interest in the
barren platitudes which they tricked out in
their studied “classical” garb. And because
the sole attention was concentrated upon the
manner of expression and very little upon
the theme, the poetry was next to valueless.
That is just my charge against modern musi-
cal standards.
Mr. Wunderlich’s explanation as to how
the classics became classics is worth exam-
ining. “What is a classic?” he says. “To
the man in the street the word has assumed
a purely conventional meaning as denoting
something difficult —above the ordinary.”
The man in the street, which is most of us,
apparently knows nothing of the classics and
their true worth. “But,” he continues, “a
classic is really nothing more than a work
that successive generations have found good.”
But wasn’t the “man in the street” a rather
large part of each of those successive genera-
tions? And as the classic was “above” him,
how could he find it good? But Mr. Wun-
derlich is wonderfully explicit: “Popular
opinion through a sufficient period of time
seems to determine it unerringly. The musi-
cal public is universal and knows what it
wants.” But then he goes on to tell us that
music speaks a language of its own that has
to be learnt by those who would derive the
completest enjoyment from it,” and again:
“Only a highly-trained musician could pos-
sibly follow a complicated score at first hear-
ing. Now all that leaves me muddled. What
of the great mass of people in those “succes-
sive generations” that were so unerring?
Were they all highly-trained musicians? Had
they all learnt that language which is music’s
very own? If not, then how could their
preferences have possibly fixed our modern
classical standards?
I find the answer to this riddle in my own
article (R.P. l/11/’23). “Until recent years,
musical instruments and musical training
were available only to the few. Music was
to them a symbol of social superiority.” Mr.
Wunderlich has made it quite plain that it
was these, the select few, whose preferences
fixed our standards. Music was the toy of
the aristocracy, and they fixed its standards,
as they fixed all standards, upon a class basis,
llie basis was all wrong, and it is rapidly
passing. The standards, too, must pass. But
in the meantime, the classicist admits that
the poor may have their “folk-songs.” They
should not be blamed, for who could expect
them to know any better? But the best
people have their “higher music” and “it
should not be sneered at nor its devotees
reviled.” Thus is given an eloquent testi-
mony to the truth of my previous statement.
But, out of the depths of my ignorance, I
want to protest that the purpose of music
should not be, as Mr. Wunderlich claims, to
give pleasure. That is the purpose of the
dance tune and the comic song, just as it is
the purpose of the sentimental novel, topical
jingle and pictures of fat babies playing with
furry dogs. But it is not and never was the
purpose of art; and if the musician wishes
to rank as. an artist, he will have to stop con-
sidering himself a vendor of pleasure. Now,
there have been rare occasions when I have
heard music that is art and art of a very fine
sort; and when listening I have caught fleet-
ing but inadequate glimpses of the splendor
that some day music will shed upon the
world. But the sensation I have felt has
not been pleasure or enjoyment. This rare
music did not soothe. It was not a nar-
cotic. It provoked. It made me more
acutely Conscious of the torturing passions
that surged within me, and implanted in me
new emotions: yearnings that were not
mine before, regrets I had never known. All
art does that. The finest does it to a super-
lative degree. And that is not pleasure,
lleasure.has its essence in self-forgetfulness,
and music must, for the future, aim at just
the opposite end. But I have attended con-
cert after concert and recital after recital
when men with quite amazing reputations
have been the idols of the moment- and I
have not found art there, and I have not
found pleasure either. Instead, I have found
infinite artistry. And there, too, I have
tounq the ‘music-loving public” worshipping
the idol on the platform, transfixed with ad-
miration for his artistry, expressing their
admiration by stamping their well-shod feet
upon the unoffending floor. It is against
these that music must rebel. Caliban has
conquered Ariel and holds him in thrall. Until
his bonds are loosed, the sweetness of his
singing will be hushed and the magic of his
wand impotent.
LESTER WAY.
Lost Delights
Ihe Beggar’s Opera,” which had a fair
run in Australia, has lately finished one of
three and a half years in London—a record
which has been beaten by only “Cliu Chin
Chow and “Charley’s Aunt.” And of
course it was exceedingly successful when
first produced in 1728. Does not this sug-
gest that there are many other old works
which would be as popular now as in their
own period if given to the public again?
I or my own part I can think of a number of
books lost, lent and never returned, or
stolen —for which I would be glad to
pay double the original price. None of
theni are classics, and they mostly date from
the beginning of this century or the end of
the last.
-Hichens’s “The Londoners,” for example,
rins admirably comic work has added
piquancy from the fact that the Bun Em-
peror and his wife were understood to be
relatives of the author. Anyhow, the home
of the Emperor and Empress, which the
fashionable party from London rented for
Ascot week, was in detail that of a newly-
enriclied family near Sunningdale. At about
the time the “Yellow Book” was in its hey-
day a series of stories, of from ten to fifteen
thousand words each, appeared in one of the
big London monthly reviews. They were
published in book form eventually, with the
title “Aut Diabolus Aut Nihil,” which was
the name of the first, and, as I always
thought, the feeblest. The most thrilling
was about a descendant and reincarnation of
Judas Iscariot, who, with other members of
his hideous and evil family, inhabited the
banks of the Dneiper. In appearance these
creatures are exaggeratedly Jewish, and so
repulsive that they veil their faces with
cloths. The hero of the story—a wealthy
young Englishman—offends the Iscariot by
commenting in rashly loud tones on the lat-
ter s ghastly aspect, and the climax is con-
cerned with the monster’s revenge. All the
yarns are indescribably weird, and all are
well written by one who obviously knew all
about “the East” and fashionable London
and Paris. He was said to be a famous
diplomat, but used a nom dc nlume—
“X.Y.Z.” Another first-rate writer of
mystery stuff whose works are hard to come
by these days is Le Fanu. I know no pas-
sage in Oppenheim, Le Quex or indeed any
modern purveyor of sensationalism to com-
pare for horror with the scene in “Uncle
Silas” where the pickaxe of the villain
crashes in error into the brain of the sleep-
ing villainess. “The Green Carnation,”
another book by Hichens, which is practi-
cally unpurchasable, was more than a bril-
liant picture of a fantastic epoch and set of
men : it in a sense made history. Hichens
happened to meet Oscar Wilde in Egypt, put
the unhappy Irishman and his friends into
the best-seller he had made up his mind to
write, and thereby ensured the downfall of
his stout fi-iend. Many people in London
besides the Marquis of Queensberry knew all
about Wilde, but they had not seen their sus-
picions in print. “The Green Carnation”
acted on the father of Lord Alfred Douglas
as a goad; and it blew common gossip to such
proportions that after the Wilde-Queensberry
suit the reluctant police had no choice but
to act.
G. S. Street's “Autobiography of a Boy,”
which I have not seen outside a public library
for .15 years, remains one of the best exposi-
tions of the male mind in nonage that
has been achieved in English. It was a tre-
mendous success in the literary sense when
it first appeared quarter of a century ago,
and certainly would be again amongst those
with the capacity to enjoy keen satire and
good craftsmanship. While on the sub-
ject of satire, Belloc’s “Mr. Burden”—a
delightful gibe at the swindling Empire
patriot who has existed in every age since
empires first appeared—is among the stolen
or strayed from my library, and another re-
gretted absentee is “The Caravanners,” by
the lady who was first heard of as author of
“Elizabeth and Her German Garden.” “The
Caravanners” contains the most convincing
Prussian “von” in the language. Most book-
lovers could fill columns with the titles of
volumes gone astray, brief recitals of their
charms, and lamentations over the loss of
them. Everyone to his taste.
My little list may appeal to some as
trivial; and if it does so much the better. In
that event the book-pincher may possibly
realise that what is no more than a whim
to him can be the cause of the keenest exas-
peration to another. I would gladly ex-
change any six books of German scientists
which are on a shelf above me as I write
for Max Nordau’s “Degeneration,” which
empirical yet intriguing work was borrowed
from me in 190 G and never returned.
HENRI SINGEMOINE.
A Note on Centenaries
Scarcely a day passes but is the hundredth
anniversary of the birth or death of some
half-forgotten poet, some minor lyrist or
some defunct dramatist, and the hungry
scribe is given an opportunity to earn a
guinea by digging him up. But this does
not content some people. A writer in Syd-
ney seized the opportunity of late to remind
the world that the day was the hundred and
first anniversary of the birth of Keats, and
thereon hung half a column of adulation of
the poet and his work. Now this is sheer
greed, and deserves to be frowned upon with
the utmost severity by the enthusiast of
legitimate centenaries. For they are the
harvest of free-lances, and their fame must
not be sullied by irreligious hands. We all
know the little entries in our notebooks
telling us that it is a hundred years since
Shelley was born or died, or since Lamb
ceased to write for the London Magazine.
Six weeks before that date there is a cave,
warning us that it is time to gird up our
loins, and betake ourselves to the public
libraries and literary encyclopaedias, to wring-
out our “personal appreciations” of the for-
gotten dead. Then we go grinning home
with our guineas. There are other articles
to be written as well —the appreciations of
their permanent places in literature, the
criticisms of their least-known work, and all
the rest of the dust. In England, of course,
the most learned fountain-pens have long
been at work upon them, while astute pub-
lishers, foreseeing the deluge, are busily pre-
paring editions de luxe of men ivhose life-
time scarcely brought them the glory of a
second edition, while equally astute guides
are arranging specially-conducted tours to
tne oak-trees under which the immortals
made their first pothooks and hangers. Oh,
it’s a golden harvest for everyone! It is
much more satisfactory than the death, of
some' present-day writer, who is apt to die
without due warning and leave the literary
leader-writers scratching their heads for an
opinion to pass upon him.
Poor immortals! So many of them in
their lifetime hungered for mere notice.
And now laudation and a little competent
and fair criticism is showered upon them.
Are they laughing somewhere, a trifle piti-
fully, at the appreciation and notice which
might have meant so much had it come in
time? Or are they passing it by with scorn?
It is a question whether this literary exhu-
mation is worth while. These writers have
had their day, and we have writers of our
own to quarrel over. So many literary
reputations of the past, examined in the
hard, cold light of a century of knowledge
and broadened taste, show thin and frail.
But this winnowing process is probably the
best thing about literary centenaries. It
shows us, at least, who is fit for a place
in our permanent literature, and who should
be allowed to rest in comfortable and eter-
nal oblivion, without burdening the pages
of our literary text-books for the future.
But these exhumations must give our
notables of to-day an occasional pang. Does
Bernard Shaw wonder what we shall
be saying about him in 1956? And does
G. K. Chesterton fear that his paradoxes
will not sparkle so brightly as those of Max
Beerbohm towards the end of this century?
It must be a melancholy thought; but per-
haps they are sure of the verdict of pos-
terity. In any case, it will not matter over-
much to them when their time comes.

The Man Behind, by G. B. Burgin (Hutchinson).
The 67th book from the Burgin factory, which is
run on much the same lines as Henry Ford’s. Burgin
had a file of Turkish material to use up. This book
is the result —a Ford book, obviously the work of
a tradesman who is out to supply something just
good enough; whose business it is to sell books, and
who knows that the big money is in the big turnover.
Willis Island, by Capt. J. K. Davis (Critchley
Parker). As soon as Capt. Davis became Director
of Navigation he began to worry about the lack of
facilities for warning shipping of the approach of
hurricanes on the Queensland coast. Ever since
wireless came into use a station on Willis Island
had been advocated by Queensland members of the
Federal Parliament: and in 1919-20 Capt. Davis
made inquiries which led to the station being
approved. The Navy Department was drawn into it;
and this little book is the story of the accomplish-
ment. With it is an introduction by Prof. Griffith
Taylor, discussing hurricanes and similar phenomena.

And pansies cupp’d the last drops of the dew.

The fresh, sweet voices of the rain your knell.

That lovers fear; they pass beyond to woo,
Smiling upon this lonely form of mine,
Seated with shadows in the falling dusk;
Lovers that laugh but know not what I
know —
That you are here with gentle eyes ashine,
And hair still fragrant as the richest musk,
And milk-white hands that touched mine
long ago.

CECIL MANN.
The Circular Quay.
Since I sat ’mid bare-legged urchins fishing
here, with youth aglow,
Things have changed—so that I fancy ’twas
a hundred years ago;
Of the Quay that I remember nothing now,
alas, abides
But the coming and the going of the ever-
moving tides.
Other times and other fashions. All is alien
that I see;
Stately liners, ocean-castles line the wharves
around the Quay.
Hither, thither, ferries hurry, cabins crowded,
decks a-throng;
Seen is now no graceful clipper, heard is now
no sailor’s song.
In the days that I re-vision—days long dead
and passed away—
Here the Cutty Sark lay resting, there at
rest the Brilliant lay;
Gone the figureheads I gazed on, gone the
masts I loved to climb;
All the picture of my boyhood has been
painted out by time.
What a joy it was to b.oard them in those
magic days of old,
And to listen to the stories that their bearded
sailors told!
Yarns of foreign parts they spun us while
we hearkened in amaze—
Where are now the ships and sailors of the
good old clipper days?
Blows the nor’east wind, salt-laden, as it
blew when I was young,
But in vain, in vain, I listen for the songs
that once were sung,
For the happy, hearty chanteys, roared and
rolled from bearded lips,
That the sailors sang at twilight on the
Quayside clipper-ships.
Since those days all things have altered
’neath the moulding hand of change,
Save the winds no man may order, and the
tides that roam and range,
Now as then the Cove refreshing with their
waters, clear and cold—
Ah, the clippers! Ah, the sailors! Ah, the
Quay I knew of old!

The Bird of Paradise.
Oh, when I think upon the evil will
And blindness that to spirits sensitive
Make of the world beyond the natural ill,
A place where, caged, tormented, still we
live! —
Where the starved cat, homeless, and big
with young
Looks up for pity in human eyes in vain,
And where the hunted hare is torn among
A careless crowd that does not feel its
pain ;
Where man slays man, and with consum-
mate art
Slays every generous impulse with a
word—-
How could I still endure if in my heart
I did not hear the singing of a bird?
Ah, me! What is it—hushed, but never
mute,
And haunting as a half-remembered dream?
Is it that melody from Orpheus’ lute
Heard long ago by Thracian wood and
stream,
That strain divine which stirred the dry,
dead bones
To quickening life again, and with a breath
Made matter move and drew the very stones
And charmed the powers of darkness and
of death?
Is it religion, that compelling Voice
So sweet, which calls the pilgrim towards
the Cross,
Bidding him find in sacrifice his joys,
Freedom in service, gain in earthly loss?
Or do I hear the immortal nightingale
Making for poets a magic of such might
That sound becomes itself a sevcn-hued veil,
A rose of fire, a rainbow of delight?
How can I tell? And yet perhaps I know;
For Buddha underneath the lotus-tree
Listened to this same music long ago:
And Christ our Brother high on Calvary,
In His dark hour of anguish, heard above
The mortal discords, jubilant and clear,
The singing of the deathless Bird of Love
Which falls but faintly on a mortal “a~.
O Bird, wdiose song is color, light and rest,
Strength to the strong, and wisdom to the
wise.
Sing on! Make of the whole wide world
your nest,
O Saviour Love—dear Bird of Paradise!

LIFE IS JUST ONE LOAN AFTER
ANOTHER.
That was the situation in Australia at the
close of the year, and the words cover every-
thing of importance. None of the local flota-
tions go very well nowadays, and some go
badly, and some vary the monotony
by going worse. N. 8. Wales and Queens-
land have been offering 51 per cent, loans,
guaranteed to be exempt from Federal and
State income-taxes, and giving long credit to
the lender. That is to say, he pays a de-
posit on his bonds and gives his lOU for
the rest. It is the “lay-by” system prac-
tised by tin* cheapest class of retailer, and
carried a little further than usual. The
last South Australian local venture
wasn't exactly a success. The last
Westralian one was almost exactly a
failure. As some old bonds had to be paid
off there was a hurried recourse to Mel-
bourne banks, which found the amount at
6 per cent., with exemption from State and
Federal income-taxes. Luckily it was only a
million, which wasn’t too much for the in-
stitutions to handle. Had it been five mil-
lions events might have happened in quick
succession. The rise from 54 per cent, to
6 per cent., following on the rise from 5 per
cent, to 54 per cent., free of both income-
taxes, is another step on the road that Aus-
tralia is now always travelling. The next
concessions may lx; free lunch and freedom
from death duties, and possibly still another
J- per cent, interest. Three States were
obviously and notoriously in trouble at the
gladsome Hogmanay season. One was
Westralia, which made its 6 per cent, bar-
gain in Melbourne, on the ground that it
wasn’t even worth ivliile to try the open
market. Another was Tasmania, which
openly hangs out the SOS signal, and de-
mands help from the Commonwealth. The
third was Queensland, which has been bor-
rowing at 7 per cent., which is up against
the first big renewal its Theodore Govern-
ment has had to face, and which is told
plainly that it will be fought when it applies
for accommodation at the old address unless
it repeals certain of its legislation. The
position of the other three States isn't at
all good, but they aren’t quite dismasted and
driving before the gale.
Hitherto the Commonwealth has done a
great deal for its insane children. It has
raised loans for them, and lent them the
proceeds of the Federal note issue in a
cheerful spirit. Now, having £100,000,000
of its own falling due in 1924-25, .and its
last renewal having been a very qualified
success, it will probably be pretty busy for
a while on its own affairs. As a matter of
dismal fact, the Commonwealth badly wants
money from the States just when they badly
want money from it. The various Hughes
Governments decided that there was about
£30,000,000 of flic gold received in exchange
for paper which could be spared for invest-
ment. It might have been devoted to buying
up old State-securities that were nearly fall-
ing due, thereby making provision against
the big and disastrous squeeze which was
sure to come if big sums, wholly unprovided
for, had to be found on a fixed day, in a
money market that had been wrecked by war.
This would have done a great deal to avert
the present crisis, but it would have involved
the unpleasantness of telling the State Gov-
ernments to get new loans where and how
they could, or to practically leave off new
public works for the time. Seeing that so
many of the workers were away at the
Front, there was really small need of works.
But the ways of the Hughes Government
were ways of pleasantness, and all its paths
were grease. It lent money in a regardless
sort of fashion, and told the States to get
ahead with all kinds of jobs, even if wages
and the cost of materials were at the top.
It bade theni “go it,” and they have gone it
ever since. When the last Federal figures
appeared the Commonwealth held as part
security its own lOU for £3,000,000, and new
short-dated State lOU’s for about £23,000,000,
including those of Queensland, Westralia
and Tasmania for large amounts. The Com-
monwealth needs the money, and the States
badly need more money, and the two needs
don’t fit in.
* * * *
With five million people doing enough big
finance for 20 millions or more, and great
masses of wealth going hurriedly into loans
from which they emerge gradually, and other
great masses being chronically saved up for
interest day, it seems that Australia really
wants more paper money (with adequate gold
reserves), even if the stuff has sunk for the
time being into an irredeemable condition.
When very great financial institutions say
that it is impossible to lend money even on
the best city security for a month or so,
because, until some blessed loan operation is
over, there isn’t money, the position is cer-
tainly remarkable. The demand, of course,
is for oHi’>ary usable paper. The vast
mass of £lOOO notes which a bygone Govern-
ment of freaks passed on to the banks, and
which they are not allowed to pass on to the
public, don’t answer the description. They
are said to serve a useful end as a handy
medium with which the banks can pay their
debts to each other, but it is hard to see the
need for a special currency for that pur-
pose, any more than there is need for a
special currency for issue to red-headed
females and no others. Certainly it is diffi-
cult to imagine that there ever could be a
real use for £28,000,000 of this peculiar
financial material, yet that quantity existed
in the best inflation days. The issue was
really begun as a “War Precaution” of a
sort towards the end of 1914, until which
time the world struggled along just as well
without it, and it should have ended with
the war. It is impossible to resume the
circulation of gold, lest it should unit the
country unanimously in payment for imports,
and leave the paper issue “in the air.” Yet
pretty plainly something is needed.
* * * *
It is unnecessary to say that the States
which are in the worst difficulties are those
with the smallest proportion of their popula-
tion engaged in factory industry, and the
biggest proportion hanging on to the uncer-
tain reed of “primary production” and the
“great natural resources of the country.”
At latest estimates these were the figures
Factory Workers per 10,000 Inhabitants (1921-22).
Victoria .. 911 | Queensland .. 536
N. S. Wales .. 685 | Westralia .. 527
S. Australia ... 607 | Tasmania .. 463
Average 702.
Tasmania is naturally the most “busted”
member of the family; but, then, the island
has always been infested by Freetrade
cranks. It had a very high tariff in pre-
Fedcration days, but it was a purely revenue
tariff, and was no more devised to promote
manufactures than the N. S. Wales import
duty of £lOO each on Chinese was intended
to promote Chinamen. But all the States
save Victoria are below average, and even
if the entire Commonwealth was raised well
above the Victorian record, it would be none
too much. This country floats the eternal
loan in London because imports, brought
here to hinder and destroy local industry,
aren’t nearly paid for in recent years by
exports, while interest on foreign debt isn’t
provided for at all, and gold must be dug out
of somewhere to meet liabilities. And it
floats the eternal loan in Australia to invent
works to employ the people who should be
busy in factories —busy at making the costly
imports unnecessary. Wherefore life in Aus-
tralia is just one loan after another.
DWINDLING MANUFACTURES.
Unwise is the Commonwealth Treasurer
who predicts a slump in Customs revenue
when the foreign-loan industry is booming
as it never boomed lie fore. With the con-
fidence of inexperience Earle Page budgeted
for a reduction of £3.222.000 in the receipts
from Customs and Excise — i.c,, from
£32.872.000 in 1022-23 to £20.650,000 in
1023-24—explaining that last year’s collec-
tions had been too high to last, and that a
“shrinkage” had set in already (“already”
was July 261. The “shrinkage” must have
disappeared immediately after the Treasurer
noticed it, for the first half
yielded £1,311.300 more than the first hail
of 1922-23, and £2,934,400 more than Page s
estimate for the period. The actual revenue
was £17,759,900, the December returns
(£3,000,600) being a record for that month.
Roughly, the position is that the Govern-
ment has got in six months three-fifths of
what it counted on getting in 12 months.
And the root of the matter is that the tariff
is not doing its job. While the loan-ted
imports swell and the loan-fed revenue
mounts, Australian workmen are idle, Aus-
tralian industries decay. #
From the standpoint of those who hoped
that the Greene tariff would be effective, in
which case there would have been a steady
decline in imports instead of a bounding
increase, the situation is really worse than
the figures indicate. Under the last two
Governments a practice has grown up of
waiving the duties on articles which, it is
alleged, cannot be, or are not being, produced
in the Commonwealth. The. concession is
bestowed on State Governments as well as
private individuals, and the Treasurer him-
self has testified that it is granted exten-
sively :
The provisions enabling machinery and material
to be imported free of duty, provided such cannot be
commercially manufactured in the Commonwealth,
have- been largely operated on the recommendation
of the Tariff Board. Without these provisions,
many industries would have to pay heavy duty on
special machinery, minor articles and raw materials.
Thps contributions would be made to the revenue
without any benefit to Australian industries.
Nor is the Tariff Board bound by the pro-
viso that the goods must be such as “cannot,
be manufactured in Australia.” In its
annual report it notes that it was instru-
mental in getting the duties lifted from the
rails and track materials required for a
Government line to the Mitchell group-
settlements in Westralia. There was no
urgency about the business, for the group-
settlements are fairly close to existing rail-
ways, and it wall be another year at least
before the most advanced groups reach the
producing stage. Moreover, it is impossible
for even a Tariff Board to plead ignorance
of the fact that rails and track materials
are manufactured at Newcastle (N.S.W.).
The Board tries to defend itself by assert-
ing that Australian supplies were unavail-
able when the concession was authorised —•
i.c., in October, 1922. Doubtless, the sup-
plies would have been available in good time
had the order been placed with the Broken
Hill Proprietary, Dtd., but, thanks to a
body which was called into existence in the
hope that it would be a help to Australian
industry, the job was sent abroad instead. The
consequences of this reckless departure from
the fiscal policy laid down by Parliament
have been almost tragic. Having loan
money to burn various State Governments are
rushing into foreign markets for engines,
coaches, trucks and so forth —articles which
they were accustomed to buy in Australia
before the Tariff Board arrived and with it
the prospect of getting the duties removed.
The S.A. Railway Department, now run by
an imported Commissioner, announces that it
has received quotations for locomotives, box
cars and wreck trains from Sweden and
Czecho-Slovakia. Even the Commonwealth
Government has caught the contagion, and is
advertising in British newspapers for 14
small locomotives, all of which could be
turned out in any of five States.
* * * *
It is a time of desperate anxiety for Aus-
tralian manufacturers and workmen. The
difficulty is to pick up a paper without light-
ing on items like the following:—
Owing to -the dumping of foreign textile goods,
hosiery in particular, 2000, textile workers- —a third
of those formerly engaged in the industry—are
unemployed. The Tariff Board admits that the
industry is suffering severely, but refuses to recom-
mend the application of dumping duties.
In its annual report the directorate of the Com-
monwealth Board Mills, Ltd., condemns the policy
of the Federal Government in purchasing strawboard
outside. Australia. It is not a question of quality—
the Australian is quite as good as the Dutch product.
But the landed cost of imported strawboard is
£l4 55., as against the selling price of £l7 for
the article manufactured here, and the Commonwealth
Government buys the foreign article in preference.
The works established bv John Lysaght (Aus-
tralia), Ltd., at a cost of £400,000, for the manu-
facture of galvanised-iron have not so far been
able to yield a dividend. Prices have been cut to
such an extent to compete with the imported article
that barely . 21 per cent, on the invested capital is
being realised.
(Tnionists in the iron and allied trades complain
that, as a result of the enormous increase in the
imports of metals and machinery—-there was a
jump from £25,096,000 to £35,195,000 in the last
fiscal year—they are unable to get work.
Yet the Priminister, it is written, is going
to Canada to arrange for tariff reciprocity
with that country—a country which buys a
little of our raw material and offers to buy
a little more; which sells us a lot of its
manufactured goods, and hopes to sell a great
deal more. He would be much better advised
to return to Australia forthwith and go bald-
headed for an all-round increase of the duties
hitherto thought to be protective, along
with a limitation of imports 'in the case of
commodities like cinematograph films, and
the cancellation of the British preference in
respect of goods partly manufactured on the
European Continent and finished in British
factories and workshops. Without the adop-
tion of some such measures, and that with-
out waste of time, the state of many Austra-
lian industries will go from bad to worse.
THE JANE OF PROGRESS.
In spite of the people who believe that all
the better things of life are to be traced
to a mud hut in the Nile Valley, there are
indications that the race of man may have
touched high places in some remoter past
than the spade of the archaeologist has yet
unearthed. So persistent are certain under-
currents of thought in the minds of different
races to-day, so diverse are the cosmogonies
from which the most vital thought of widely
sundered peoples began, and so varied the
ideals towards which human minds are reach-
ing, that there seems very fair ground for
the assumption that the Nile mud hut has
a rival in a tent to the east, a beehive nest
to the south, a wickerwork structure to the
north, and possibly a wigwam to the west.
The air of Egypt was the best preservative
of primeval remains; but a very early world
had so many good ideas, which Egypt through-
out her whole history failed to discover, as
to suggest upward developments elsewhere
as early and possibly more valuable. Bc-
cause work in stone is more durable than
work in wood, the archaeologist has almost
made stone the standard of civilisation ; and
in every dip back into the past this stand-
ard is used to rule out nations which may
easily have been far more advanced in the
less durable arts. Similarly in all conjec-
tures with regard to the future, a standard
of mechanical achievement is set up as a
test of human progress. New York is great
because of high buildings; but viewed in
true perspective skyscrapers are the clever
freak-work of an insane people who have
wasted all that fine effort in doing a useless
thing. The WoolwOrth Building and the
Great Pyramid together represent a less
serious advance than a postage stamp or a
stringless garden bean.
Wireless, the triumph of the air, the won-
ders of medical science and similar matters
engage most of the attention of the press, and
are tacitly accepted by the multitude as the
hallmarks of modern progress; but it is
worth while to take a more comprehensive
view of the field and ask seriously whether
man is likely to win his highest place in
these directions or in some other. To take
such a survey it is necessary to leave the
field of achievement and enter that of ideas.
To get at the real heart of the matter we
want to know not what men are doing but
what they are hoping; and we want to dis-
cover the kind of men who are clinging to
the special kinds of hopes. Leaving out the
vast hosts of people whose hopes are bounded
by three meals a day, and the still vaster
hosts who hope for wealth to fortify the
three meals, we come to various little groups
of more or less independent thinkers who are
in some sense the prophets of the time.
Among these the most outstanding fact is
that the smallest group of all is the one
which sincerely believes that our present
lines of progress represent serious achieve-
ment. Infinitely larger are the two main
religious groups, which, with many different
sets of theologies and called by scores of
names, are yet thinking more and more in-
tensely towards certain goals. The first of
these are the moralists —people who believe
that divine forces coupled with human endea-
vor are working towards a perfection of the
human will on earth. All other progress is
incidental and relatively unimportant. To
them the wholly self-disciplined man is more
than wireless or development of radium.
Given a world of such men, Heaven, in their
view, will bloom on earth; and it matters
little whether it is a heaven of skyscrapers
or of desert tents. The second group of
religionists regards the earth as a place of
trial, and holds that man’s real work and
larger life are away in some other world, of
which death is the outer gate. Both groups
have an immense amount of humbug and
hypocrisy on the fringe and an immense
amount of sincerity at the centre. To the
latter group, too, must be added the curious
new sects of so-called spiritualists —people
who maintain the general idea that life
after death matters more than life at present,
but who dissociate that idea from all the
acknowledged creeds and tenets, and in great
measure from all moral standards also. These
differ chiefly from the rest in their definite
claim that their beliefs have a scientific
basis ; but really scientific proof of their least
assertion seems to be still wanting.
Far larger in weight of sincerity and intel-
lectual force is another which might be
classed as the world-lovers. These are the
people —and they include nearly every poet,
philosopher, novelist, natural scientist, and
man of letters in the world—whose inner
hopes are centred on a greener earth asso-
ciated with a cleaner and happier race or
men. Much of the world’s mechanical and
scientific progress they accept with neither
praise nor dispraise, but with a hint of
regret that its utility should be so small in
proportion to its noise. They are simply
intensely interested in life, intensely held by
every form of beauty ; and when it comes to
the matter of their hopes—which are the
real things that go to the shaping of the
human future —they passionately desire that
life may grow better to live by growing more
beautiful. On their varied and generally
unvoiced definitions of beauty much of the
shape of their hope turns; but the tendency
of the whole mass of thought is towards the
simplicities and honesties of life. Man, force-
ful and seeking the best he can find, is in
their view always more to be desired than
man restrained by arbitrary law; and as for
man’s world, it is above all things desirable
to keep it from being completely trodden by
the wheels that make much dust but evolve
no new beauty. Nor is all this diffusion
of hope entirely vague and undefined. In
the mass it may seem so; but in the case or
individuals it crystallises into a thousand
forms of real and hearty endeavor. It is the
strong motive behind art; it is the mam
cause of gardens; it is the soul of libraries;
it is the essential power in political changes.
At one end it makes romance; at the other
it inspires a stoic courage. If the best hopes
of the world’s most thoughtful hopers repre-
sent the real line of future progress, our
children’s children are not in great danger of
losing their humanity in a mere buzzing ot
mechanical wheels.

Another Year of Prohibition.
N. S. Wales is to vote on prohibition in
1928, and it is hoped that by then the
I'.S.A. will offer an edifying example of the
success of the plan. It is a vain hope, loi
whatever diminution in drinking may lia\e
been effected in the Middle-West States ana
other primitive regions where alcohol was
never wildly popular, drunkenness has been
elevated into a patent of fashion and sol-
vency elsewhere. The concoctions that aii
flaunted in the great cities by the rich and
near-rich result in periodical harvests ot
sensational deaths. Every traveller—other
than professional anti-drink agitators who
returns from the States brings with him
stories of the ease with which the Volstead
Amendment can be defeated : and even those
who go abroad with the intention of seeing
as much prohibition as possible are con-
strained to admit that results can only ir
expected from, a generation, which has gionn
up without a taste for strong waters,
this generation ever appears, it will cer-


tainly not be visible in four years’ time.
Meanwhile prohibition is being hit harder
every year by temperance —a world move-
ment which is due partly to education,
partly to the rise in the status of the hotels
brought about by the activities of police,
Licensing Reduction Boards, etc., and partly
to white humanity’s developing passion for
physical fitness. Side by side with cables
from prohibitionist America telling of hun-
dreds of deaths during the past year from
alcoholic poisoning came the intimation that
free Britain had had its soberest year on
record. And Australia, with more money to
spend than ever before, had its soberest
Christmas, according to police reports, both
in the cities and in the country. A snap
vote in favor of the costly American experi-
ment might have been engineered in N. S.
Wales four years ago by means of an inten-
sively worked-up agitation containing a mixed
appeal to class, religious and political hatreds
and jealousies. There is little hope for it
now, and unless the liquor people play into
the hands of their enemies by blocking re-
forms in the trade, there will be consider-
ably less in four years’ time. If the pro-
hibitionists of N. S. Wales were half as
much interested in saving bodies and souls
as they are in scoring points at the expense
of tlie Liquor Trades’ Defence Association,
they would fall in behind those who are
striving to minimise drunkenness on different
lines from the TJ.S. model. Unfortunately,
there are persons to whom prohibition, com-
plete and unqualified, is a religion to he im-
posed by force on the world though millions
perish in the attempt. These irrational
bigots are doing the Devil’s work in the way
of spreading misery and injustice, just as
their persecuting prototypes did in the Dark
Ages in connection with spiritual dogmas.

Primary Industry and Union
Conditions.
Already doubts are expressed as to whether
tlie Australian cotton industry can pay a
white man’s wage—the A.W.U.’s wage, com-
bined with its Working hours, working pace
and scale of holidays. And already it is said
that if the cotton industry can’t do so it
must go as a matter of principle and join the
shipbuilding industry and the N. Territory
meat industry and the other late larnenteds.
Of course, tiie work spoken of is that of
glowing cotton to be sent 12,000 miles to
Lancashire, so that it may there be made
into cloth, what cloth we want being sent.
12.000 miles back again, British shipowners
collecting the freight both ways. That is
the one and only thing the British. people
have been talking about to the guileless
Theodore in Queensland. There wasn’t
even a mention of the matter of growing
enough cotton to supply enough mills here
to make enough for our own require-
ments, thus dispensing with Lancashire and
the British shipowner and the 24,000 miles
of travel; and then considering what to do
next —whether to export surplus cotton or
surplus cloth. The position is that if the cotton
export business can’t be made to pay, and
to pay splendidly, at the present prices,
which are a great deal too high to he at all
likely to last, then Australia had better shake
off the idea that it is meant to toil for the
world at large as a raw-material country,
or “primary producer,” on any A.W.U. basis.
It may become a cheap white-labor country
or a nigger-labor country or a manufacturing
country with the “primary” business as a
side-line; but if it can’t do handsomely out.
of cotton at its present price, then the old
idea that it can get fat as a raw-material
country pure and simple should be declared
“off.” And, frankly, there isn’t much to
encourage the hope that it can get fat that
way. The sugar industry plods along, but
not as an exporting proposition. Wool pro-
duction for export pays excellently, because
it employs the smallest possible number of
human unionists, and the unpaid sheep does
nine-tenths of the work. Tlie bullock trade
pays occasionally for similar reasons. Wheat,
hay and oats formed, at last count, about
90 per cent, of Australia’s agriculture,
and of these only wheat is exported.
But the tendency is to cut up wheat
production into one-man jobs, with a
scrap of the cheaper variety of hired
labor once a year. And tlie one man
is a sweated and precarious piece-worker,
living much of tlie time contrary to all
union rules and regulations. For the five
seasons. 1915-16 to 1919-29, the N. S. Wales
Statistician put his earnings down at 50s. 9d.
per week, provided he struggled witli 250
acres of land, which is no small contract.
The butter and cheese trade depends mostly
on the toil of the father, who is a piece-
worker making what lie can get, and his
children, who represent a form of very cheap
compulsory labor. The simple truth of the
whole matter is that long distances, short
hours and long wages don’t herd together
successfully. Therefore all that the most
frenzied advocates of “settlement” ever do is
to urge the indefinite multiplication of the
hard-worked, precariously-paid, non-union
wheat-man, or the child-sweating non-union
cowman, and their extension to less promis-
ing districts further out.
Small Sister’s Troubles.
"We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts.
W hat shall we do for our sister in the day when
she shall be spoken for?” —lnappropriate and mean-
ingless quotation from the Son/) of Solomon.
Dear Bulletin, —The man who wrote in a
recent Bulletin about Tasmania’s troubles
made out a fairly good case for Common-
wealth assistance, but an even better one is
possible. The island’s position is certainly
had. One of its big troubles came with
Federation. Some of the States, which
didn't depend so very much on Customs
revenue, were made richer by tlie union in
the early Braddon Blot days, which is to
say that they got more tariff money than
before, even after the Commonwealth had
taken its bit. Some were made poorer.
Comparing the total revenue figures for
1902-03 with those of the last pre-Federation
year this was the situation:—
New South Wales Gain -.. £1,674,511
Westralia ~ . . 475,776
Victoria Loss .. 4,965
South Australia ~ .. 31,757
Tasmania ~ .. 113,231
Queensland „ .. 398,781
Roughly speaking, Tasmania lost one-eighth
of its net income, while even Queensland
lost only one-eleventh, and as the Common-
wealth's requirements grew the loss in-
creased. Further, Tasmania always had the
most money-losing of the State railway sys-
tems, except when Queensland, under Theo-
dore, snatched the laurel from it. Its lines
should have been charged, or mostly
charged, to revenue, just as roads
and schools ought to be, as neces-
sary but non-revenue-producing adjuncts of
civilisation. For the island hasn’t much
more "innards” than Oliver Twist had on
a workhouse diet, and cheap sea-carriage
competes everywhere. Being a sea-girt pro-
position, it is the one member of the Com-
monwealth, barring the Northern Territory
(or even more than the Territory, which has
a land outlet of a kind, and has unfulfilled
promise of a better one), whose means of
communication with the other members is
wholly regulated by Commonwealth law.
The land revenue (sales and rents) is con-
sistently the lowest per head save that of
Victoria, and is only one-eighth that of
Queensland. This is partly due to the gener-
osity of the British rulers in dissipating the
public estate when the world was young, and
partly to other causes, which include too
much unsaleable scenery. There is so much
perpendicular scenery that nearly one-eighth
of the State (3030 square miles) is a terra
incognita to the extent that the industrious
Weather Bureau can supply no rainfall
records. Presumably the rain gauge fell off
and broke its neck. The writer who re-
cently dealt with this subject in The Bul-
letin suggested extra taxation on unearned
land values; but the fact obtrudes that the
Federal land-tax shark, who specialises in
big properties (big in either size or value
or both) and is reputed to be no loser of
opportunities, wrested less money out of his
Tasmanian clients in 1022 than in 1921, and
less in 1921 than , in 1920. The only other
State which similarly backslid in 1922 was
Westralia. Then the Tasmanian State land-
tax is a heavy thing—over twice as much per
head as Victoria’s, nearly four tjmes as much
as Westralia’s, and bigger than that of S.
Australia. A familiar theory is that Tas-
mania is too absurdly small to be a “sover-
eign State,” though there are nine smaller
ones in the IT.S.A. (in fact, one of them
could go into Tasmania 25 times simultane-
ously), and our Small Sister is a bloated
monster compared with Belgium, Holland,
Denmark or Switzerland, and is even big
enough to give Austria a run for its money.
But nobody explains what cheaper thing it
could be than it is. Annexation to another
State would only put up the cost of adminis-
tration to the other State’s figure, which
would be a big increase. About £6000 per
annum might be saved by the abolition of
the Upper House, but that wouldn’t go far.
The imported Governor’s salary of £2458
could be saved, but as a matter of fact it is
being saved already, no suitable im-
ported person offering at _ the price.
The moral of all which is that it
isn’t easy to propound a remedy for
the case,, since it isn’t desirable that Tas-
mania should be wound up, or assign its
estate and pay something in the £, or bolt
to avoid its creditors. But in the ordinary
course of events it should soon have plenty
of company in the hole it has dropped into.—

In Kin” George’s Name.
Just before Christmas the Fuller Govern-
ment was requested to appoint a Royal Com-
mission to determine whether an honorable
member of the N. S. Wales Assembly has
ever lived with Totties or been treated
for venereal disease, as asserted by another
honorable member. The same' expedient was
suggested during the recent controversy be-
tween Bailey, Labor member for Goulburn,
and Willis, chairman of the N. S. Wales
A.L.P. executive, the proposal being that
the taxpayers, 98 p.c. of whom have no-
thing to do with Labor pre-selections, should
defray the cost of ascertaining if the A.W.U.
boss was a party to the use of ballot-boxes
with sliding panels. There is a certain
robust insolence in the idea of commanding
trusty and well-beloved subjects of George
V. to investigate the medical history of one
of his brawling legislators and the Tam-
many tricks imputed to another, the public
paying all expenses. The notion could only
have originated in a country where licensed
blackguardism and an overpowering opinion
of their own importance are common among
elected persons, and if George Y. ever gets
to hear of it his edification will doubtless
be great. But the craving for Royal Com-
missions is by no means confined to N. S.
Wales. The Victorian Government has it
in a bad form, Lawson’s worst offence being
a Cost-of-Living Commission which looks like
burbling on for years. The infection has
also reached Mitchell, of Westralia. In
that State eight Royal Commissions are at
work or about to start —Cost-of-Living. Arbi-
tration, Apprenticeship, Kendenup Settle-
ment, Jandakot Road Board, Empire Mining
Syndicate. Gosnell’s Estate and Peel Estate.
This challenges the grandiose record of the
Hughes Government, whose flock of Royal
Commissions (their labors went for nothing,
since their recommendations were never
adopted) ate up £39,713 in 1920-21. Hither-
to the Royal Commission has been a more or
less fraudulent device for enabling shiftless
Governments to shelve awkward questions,
and, incidentally, to find light and useless
employment for faithful supporters or too-
candid friends. Now that it has got down
to the level of being requisitioned to decide
whether one gutter politician is viler than
another, or whether this or that set of poli-
tical ruffians stuffed the ballot-boxes, it will
have to be abolished in the interests of public
decency, as well as of public economy.
Parliaments Here and in Britain.
“The progress of Australia was hampered consider-
ably by the fact that there were too many Parlia-
ments "within its borders. Great Britain, with 10
times as many people to govern, could manage very
well with less Parliaments than there were in the
Commonwealth. He thought one Parliament was
sufficient for Australia.”—Common b.ither.
A great many people have very mixed ideas
of British methods, and a tremendous scorn
of Australian ones. They will attest that
Britain runs its whole show with one Par-
liament, and that Australia has more Legis-
latures and legislators than any other land
on earth. Asa matter of fact, the United
Kingdom has six recognised Parliaments, or
one for every 20,272 sq. miles, while the
Commonwealth has seven, or one for every
424,940 sq. miles. The most bulky of the
minor Parliaments here is that of N. S.
Wales, which had 173 members at the end of
1922, nearly half unpaid; and the most bulky
in the U.K. was that of the Irish Free State,
that mere speck of ground having 213 legis-
lators, all of them paid. As regards the
Lower House, Ireland has more members
than N. S. Wales according to population,
and 17 times more in proportion to area.
The other recognised Parliaments in the
British Isles include two for the Channel
Islands and one for the Isle of Man, where
the cats have no tails. Australia’s supreme
Parliament contains 112 members, including
the voteless person from the N, Territory.
That is about one to 50,000 persons and to
every 26,560 sq. miles. The British supreme
Parliament, before the Irish members left,
contained 1447 members (unpaid Lords and
paid Commons), being a politician for every
32,650 or so persons, and one for every 84
sq. miles. Yet Laborites, capitalists, ortho-
dox politicians and an unlimited number of
ill-read fools explain at a moment's notice
every day of the week that, on a population
or any other basis, the over-representation
of Australia is an outrage on British prece-
dent. Further, England has 62 minor Par-
liaments, which would be State Parliaments
if the divisions were called by the Yankee
term of “State” instead of the English one
of “County."’ That is a Parliament to 900
sq. miles. The most important of the lot,
the Parliament of London, numbers 144 mem-
bers, deals with a revenue of £24,000,000,
and peers of tremendous tonnage struggle
for a seat among its members. In addition
to all this the British railways form a very
important local-government system in them-
selves. They are not minced up with other
politics as they are here, but each system
forms a sort of republic, with its elected Par-
liament of directors meeting at its own capi-
tal or headquarters. Just before the war
there were 24 such capitals in the United
Kingdom. As they deal with a revenue of
some £250,000,000 per annum they repre-
sent quite a lot of decentralised administra-
tion. Also, they employ quite a lot of poli-
ticians ; for an elected man who manages
the country’s lines outside the House is a
political force as well as the man who mis-
manages them inside. Altogether the United
Kingdom is a very much governed, and at
the same time an intensely decentralised,
country, and when splashy and unlettered
people quote it as evidence that Australia
doesn’t require new States, and should even
abolish the States it has and run its affairs
from one centre after the old Russian or
Turkish fashion, they become a blot upon
the landscape.
♦-
The Tax-free Inspiration.
A shabby, shiftless trick in the financial
game is the issue of loans “free of Federal and
State income-taxes,” of which a large num-
ber are wandering about loose. The exemp-
tion is a discounting of the future so as to
put a better face on the present, for the bor-
rowing Government expects to get more by
selling a bond carrying 54 per cent, interest
and, say, 20 years’ freedom from tax than
by just selling the bond. In the same way
it would got 'more for land if the land was
sold free of municipal rates, and it would get
more for both land and bonds if they carried
with them protection from legal proceedings
for drunkenness, bigamy and other minor
offences. An estimate has been made that
the Commonwealth and the States are already
losing £2,000,000 a year in exemptions from
income-tax, so that the future has been dis-
counted pretty heavily. It is also estimated
that fairly big capitalists, who buy their
bonds by the load and are exempted from
a 55.-in-the-£ rate of tax, are getting
£7 6s. Sd. per cent. (51 per cent, interest
and £1 16s. Sd. rebate of tax), while still
bigger capitalists get even more; but a per-
son whose sole income is £IOO a year of in-
terest doesn't profit by the exemption at all.
Naturally there is a growing tendency among
the very rich not to go in for precarious work
which employs labor and pays full taxes, but
to sit hard on great masses of bonds, like
toads sitting on rocks. Last year an agree-
ment was arrived at that all parties should
swear off all exemption dodges by Act of
Parliament, and that the interest on all loans
issued after the beginning of 1924 should pay
both State and Federal imposts just like other
income. This might make the visible inter-
est that had to be offered bigger, and make
the visible loss on State railways and meat-
shops and “land settlement” tricks look big-
ger, but in reality it would only mean having
honest accounts instead of faked or bogus
accounts. The result was curious. Two
States, Victoria and Tasmania, passed the
necessary legislation, while the other four
didn’t. In the race to borrow everything in
sight, including the past, the present and the
future, the four evidently hoped for an advan-
tage. Out of the chaos comes the voice of
the Federal Treasurer stating that, when lie
has got his own Act through, the collection
of taxes on all loans of the 1924 and subse-
quent years’ vintage will commence. There-
fore there was a rush in the last odd half-
minutes of 1923 to nominally float loans,
though the money won’t come in till 1924.
and claim tax-exemption on them as 1923
loans. The N. S. Wales Treasurer even
professes, as a financial triumph, to have
renewed, in 1923, £10,500,000 of debt which
doesn’t fall due till August. 1924, and to
have made that free of his own taxes payable
to himself. In faet, the demoralisation has
become so bad that, in four States anyhow,
each State Treasurer is trying to rob the next
State Treasurer, to rob the Federal Treasurer,
and to rob himself. State financiers have
got to the point of breaking into their own
houses, and burgling their own safes, and
picking their own pockets, and they can no
longer trust themselves out of their own
sight for a moment. The close of 1923
looks a sort of turning-point in the IOU in-
dustry, an occasional turning-point being one
of the necessaries of life.

Monkeying with the Main Asset.
From an old hand at the business: —
Although the individual who killed the goose that
laid the golden eggs has been unanimously declared
a fool, there is a conspiracy to emulate his feat in
Australia to-day. 1 refer to the campaign for
the destruction of the pastoral industry. The one
point upon which proletariat and capitalist (other
than graziers) agree is that the subdivision of
pastoral properties into numerous small farms is
eminently desirable. The S. M. Herald, the
Million Clubber and the Labor politician alike agi-
tate at the top of their voices for this to be done —
and hang the expense! While the general attitude to
every tottering, down-at-heel concern that cumbers
the kind is paternally benevolent, the industry of
which we have special cause to be proud excites
only hostility. This seems very curious at first
sight, but actually exemplifies the danger of being
successful in an insufficiently educated democracy.
That Australia to-day hasn’t a solitary dangerous
rival in the wool-growing business is due to two
causes. First, the enthusiasm and enterprise of the
pioneers established a sound foundation. Second, the
existence of a huge scope of country admirably
adapted for raising merino sheep gave the industry
room to expand. That the men concerned in the
pastoral business have taken advantage of their
opportunities cannot be denied. The output of wool
per sheep has been practically doubled during the
past 30 years, and the carrying capacity of the land
itself has been vastly improved. Closer settlement,
however, on such areas as are actually only suit-
able for sheep, yet are in theory adapted for farming,
threatens .now to end the period of progress —in N.
S. Wales at least. When a mixed farmer can run
only 500 .sheep on his block in conjunction with
wheat gnowihg, those sheep are almost certain to
be mongrels. For one thing, his usually futile soil-
scratching' takes up most of his time ; for another,
it needs a decent-sized flock (1000 to 2000 at least)
to make good breeding pay sufficiently well to arouse
enthusiasm. Thus, while graziers on (laying areas
continue to improve, their flocks, the new settler on
his pocket-handkerchief allotment almost invariably
permits ’his little lot to breed anyhow. The real
tragedy ?of this isn't for the moment apparent, since
wool of any kind is luckily attracting high prices,
but the evil hour is only postponed. We had a
taste of the trouble in store for us some time ago,
when the accumulations of inferior wool sat long *>nd
heavily on the chest of Rawra.
By a. dispensation of Providence, who is probably
wiser though more reticent than any politician, most
of the ■country best suited for merino sheep is not
payable wheat land. The encroaching of wheat farms
on grazing areas has so far resulted mostly in im-
poverished and dissatisfied farmers demanding Gov-
ernment assistance at yvery turn, mongrel sheep, and
little* visible improvement in the total wheat yield.
Grazing and fanning interests would have clashed
very little if land settlement had proceeded along
scieaitific (as opposed to political) lines. While
the State should discourage the accumulations of
large flocks, the practice of subdividing proved past-
oral properties into innumerable dubious wheat farms
should be abandoned altogether. When such stations
need subdividing', let it be into grazing areas
of sufficient 'size to ensure both that the purity of
the flocks will be safeguarded and that the settler
will be a hnfrdy perennial instead of a bird of
passage.
Unearne tl Increment.
“Solomon Malaprdp” writes: —
There existjs a profo end faith —the kind of faith
that can remwve Small to medium gum-trees —in the
unlimited amount that an embarrassed State could
raise in an emergency by laying hands on part or
the whole of the “unearned increment,” it being
a river of wealth and a well that never goes dry.
The correspondent who summed up the difficulties
of Small Sister Tasmania in The Bulletin of a
recent daft' cordially nlcommended “increased taxa-
The Painters.
“The Bishop of Armidale (N.S.W.) said that the
bush towns in his diocese were in most cases the
ugliest, dirtiest, most inartistic and most incon-
gruous places in the world. It was a tragedy for
Australian bush life that the average wealthy
squatter did nothing for the country towns. If
by chance they visited them it was only too often
to paint them red.”
It was somewhere out where the duststorms
start
And the kookaburras laugh
That I came on a gaitered man in black
Who wrung his hands and who cried
“Alack!”
And hit the ground, as he groaned, a smack
With a thing like a pastoral staff.
“Heart up, your reverence!” I cried,
“And give dull care a spell.
Though men in the mass be grimed with sin,
The world rolls on with a merry spin,
And the bells are ringing the New Year in
O'er the land we love so well."
“I know the land is a pleasant place,
And fit for a bishop’s see,
With its fertile plains and its rolling downs,
But these cheap and squalid bushland towns
They harrow the soul of me."
“Heart up! For the cruel drought is broke,
The rain comes down with a swish ;
The creeks are bankers, abrim the dams,
The grass shoots green for the tender lambs.
Buck up ! Take comfort, Bish. !"
“Nay, where may I dump my load of care,
And how be comforted?
Though the earth be green and the skies be
blue,
I close my eyes and I only view
The squatters riding by two-and-two
With Bacchic chorus and glad halloo
To paint my bush towns red.
"Oh, satin-skinned are the steeds they ride.
Their notes are in inch-thick wads:
And manv a Bung whose trade was slow
Sits back'content while the beer-pumps go,
And grins as the varied liquors flow.
And bows to his guests as gods.
“They lia’ decked th’ barmaids with brooch
and ring,
They ha’ filled the loafers full.
With merry quip and with madcap prank
They ha’ made each parish a walking tank,
And ‘Down with Labor!’ they eke ha’ drank,
And ‘Hurrah for the price of wool!’
“They are dingy hamlets beyond compare,
Woolly and wild and wet.
And isn’t it cause for just complaint.
And wouldn’t it nark the meekest saint,
That these are the only coats of paint
My upland townships get?”
I stole away and I left him plunged
In a slough of dark despond.
Ah, me! no common woes molest
When a bishop groans like a soul possessed,
And beats with a pastoral staff his breast
Out at the back o’ Beyond.

tion on the half-million of unearned land values
the Tasmanian landowners annex every year,” and
that sort of thing comes quite natural. I don't
know anything much easier, unless the State lays
hands on the whole box of tricks, on the plea that
the land was worth nothing once, and all that it
is worth now is increment.
Of course the unearned increment is really earned
by the expenditure of somebody’s money, only it
isn’t always the money of the man who gets the
increment. Probably it isn’t often his money. For
instance, a heap of coin was spent in improvements
to create the unimproved land value of Sydney and
suburbs. In 1921 it appears that £22,000,000 was
added to the value of improvements in the city,
and this, combined with the influx of 26,000 people,
created £7,000,000 of new unimproved value. In
the country municipalities, which had poor luck in
the way of new population, the addition of 91
millions to the value of improvements added only
1-J millions to the total unimproved value.
To the business man who owns his business site
the rise in the value of said bit of ground from,
say, £10,009 to £30,000 through the general
improvement of the district, if he didn’t pay for
any of the improvement, is an obvious gain. But
his Federal land-tax increases fivefold, for the Fed-
eral Government taxes the “big” estate, even if it
is only a quarter-acre with a factory or warehouse
on it —to urge the owner to cut it up. His State
and municipal taxes also rise. So do, in pros-
pective, his Federal and State death duties. The
added value of the land doesn’t, however, make
his profits any more. He can realise by selling out
and leaving business, but loafing isn’t good for him
or for the community. If any Government decided
to make a levy on capital by annexing the unearned
increment, or a large part of it, in one strenuous
act, some people might have to sell out, and a
lot more to get into a mortgaged condition.
In 1921 the unimproved value of land in Tas-
manian municipalities increased (temporarily, I sup-
pose, and because of wild borrowing) by £1,103,516.
Whereupon the municipal people collected £48,193
more rates, and the State land-tax people collected
£7946 more tax; but as the Federal land-tax
people collected £603 less (owing presumably to
a decline in big estates) the extra exaction was
£55,536, or a little over 5 per cent, per annum.
That seemed rather like taking the lot, but on the
gentle instalment plan. Both Federal and State
authorities doubtless made a note of the new values
with a view to probate duty in the future.
In these impecunious times the municipal valuer
is often frankly accused of finding imaginary un-
earned increment where there is none. Some curious
things certainly happen. There were 16,100 fewer
inhabitants in N.S.W. shires in 1921 than in 1919,
and the local authority declared that the un-
improved capital value had risen by almost exactly
£20,000,000. Victorian shires were estimated to
have lost 11,000 of their population between 1919
and 1922, and the sanguine man of figures, doing
his best to keep up the spirits of the people in face
of the increasing debt, or going by the prices the
State had paid for “land for settlement,” held
that the total value of rateable property had risen
by some forty millions —from £176,297,529 to
£215,984,328. Queensland and AVestralia both put
a few millions on to their land values to set off
a loss of a few thousands of country population. It
all looks rather hollow and like old boom days.
And when the loan expenditure is considered
it looks very fleeting and phantasmal, just like
some of Matthew Davies’s wonderful old banks.
The unearned increment, regarded as anew and
inexhaustible source of wealth, has been discovered
much oftener even than the bogus oil-well, or
the infallible method of picking that right horse
which is always wrong.
An Unpleasant Profession.
Dear B., —The row over Melba’s Italian
choristers will be all to the good if it directs
attention in Australia to one of the most
sweated callings in the world. When an
Australian girl—it is nearly always a girl
.—hears from her music-master, the president
of the School of Arts, and, finally, the local
editor, that her voice is in the world-beating
class she imagines that the only requisite is
to get it trained abroad and then exchange
it in the musical marts of Europe for dia-
monds and motor-cars. Here is the experi-
ence of one of these deluded lasses—and she
was more fortunate than most. Her parents
paid her passage-money to England—the
triumphant public farewell in the Town Hall
barely returned the promoter his expenses—
her keep while in London and Paris and the
fees of a famous teacher. At the end of two
years she was proclaimed “finished,” and
with her repertoire of about a score of
operas capable of winning back the small for-
tune that had been lavished on her. Months
passed ere she stumbled on her Golconda —
an offer equivalent to £4 a week to sing
prima-donna roles at one of the great Riviera
opera houses. She refused. Not that she
was above £4 a week. The grandiose ideas
with which she had entered on her pro-
fession were now among the illusions of
childhood’s foolish hours. The catch was
that it would have cost her from £lO to £2O
to earn the £.4 —to make no mention of that
asset which is usually defined in bellow-
drama as “dearer than life itself.” Out of
the £4 she was expected to pay a limelight
operator, half a dozen claqueurs, the price of
a number of seats, the police, her dresser
and several others. Also —if not already
appropriated—she would perhaps have been
obliged to endure the abhorred advances of
the manager, acting either on his own behalf
or on that of a patron. Such is the
environment to which European opera
singers are accustomed. In Italy, where
everyone can sing after a fashion, male
choristers are coolies, and remunerated as
such. And this raises another aspect of
the affair. The better type of Italian is,
of course, as agreeable in his manners and
customs as any man. But the Italian coolie
occupies a niche of his own. His staple
article of diet is the onion; his fa\ 7 orite
flavoring garlic. He is usually of a full
habit, and rarely takes a bath or
changes his more intimate garments.
The reactions to this combination on a close
night and a stage made sweltering by foot-
and overhead-lights are best left undescribed.
The Australian chorus-girl is a model of
physical cleanliness. The majority in every
dressing-room see to that. And these tradi-
tionally sanitary young women are to be
asked to sing opposite foreigners, many of
whom might arouse unfavorable comment
amongst the employees of a blood-and-bone
works. The moral of it all is that Italy is Italy
and Australia Australia; and never the
twain should be asked to meet. Or, anyhow’,
not on an operatic stage. The social, econo-
mic and other standards of performers in
the tw r o countries are different, not to say
radically antipathetic, and there is no real
justification for the unpleasant arrangement
on artistic grounds. If proof is required of
this, it may be found in the case of Walter
Kirby. To get his equal in voice and artistry
it w’ould be necessary to go to one of the

Terms of Peace.
When the Protectionist party failed to
secure an absolute majority at the British
elections, and its policy of finding work for
the British unemployed by giving him the
local job which is at present filled by the
Hun exporter went by the board, there was
great joy in Hunland. It mattered little to
the Hun whether Liberalism or Labor or
Lib.-Labor came in, for either way he felt
that he had found a friend and a benefactor.
Both crowds undertake to let Fritz, with
his cheap labor and his cheap currency and
his high tariff, have the run of the British
market, and as he contrives to climb with
great agility over Australia’s inefficient tariff
he should do wonders where there is no tariff
at all. (Last Christmas there were
shops in Sydney where none but German toys
were on sale, and the demand for any other
sort was sternly resented.) The Labor
party, for which the enemy possibly has a
shade of preference, proposes to improve the
situation by a tremendous levy on British
capital (not on Hun capital, which is
sacred), and Fritz doesn’t see why the
worst shouldn’t happen to British capital.
Then it undertakes to recognise the Soviet
Government and the repudiation policy
thereof, and Germany, which is doing its
utmost to repudiate its own obligations, re-
gards such a precedent as of great value.
The Liberal party’s panacea, in addition, of
course, to giving the Hun and every other
alien the free run of the British market, is
soipething about the “restoration of peace.”
This excites unqualified approval in the
worst quarters. The enemy is more than
willing to agree that the peace which he
made quite a while ago is no peace at all be-
cause it was foi’ced upon him when he lost;
or, in other words, it w T as not at all the sort
of treaty he would have forced on the Allies
if he had won. To tear it up and start the
argument all over again from the beginning
would suit him admirably. His conception
of the terms that should be granted to the
loser when Germany is the loser were admir-
ably expounded by Ludendorff in his unin-
spired writings about the late disturbance.
It was at the beginning of 1917, when most
thing's seemed to be up a tree. The glorious
but brief revival that was to come wasn’t
even imagined then. The Russian army was
still half expected at Berlin. Italy had
joined the Allies, and its beautiful new uni-
form didn’t suggest the inefficiency which
was to lead to the heroic smash at Caporetto.
Roumania was putting up a brisk fight. The
Austrian army had proved so brittle that
nobody dreamt that the Dual Derelict would
last another 22 months; and the Turk wasn’t
answering expectations. So it w T as agreed
that the Hun had better bow his haughty
crest and intimate that he was willing to
consider reasonable terms. The terms men-
tioned in the book of the Chief of Staff as
having been drafted by the suppliant, for
submission in the first place to President
Wilson, or as the only supplbaation he knew
of, were these: —
Restoration of the portion of Upper Alsace occu-
pied by France.
A frontier securing Germany and Poland stra-
tegically and economically against Russia. (This
seemed to open the way to indefinite annexation.)
Restoration of colonies on the hasis of an agree-
ment securing to Germany colonial possessions cor-
responding to her population and her economic
interests. (Being more populous than either Britain
or France, Germany was seemingly to have a bigger
colonial empire than either of them when colonies
were put in a common heap and then divided out.)
Return to France of the territory occupied by Ger-
many, subject to strategic and economic rectification
of frontiers and to financial compensation. (How
much territory France was to lose and what com-
pensation it was to pay were left open questions.)
Restoration of Belgium, subject to definite guaran-
tees for Germany’s safety, which would be negoti-
ated with the Belgian Government. (Apparently
the big Allies were to stand aside, and the settle-
ment was to be a one-round fight between Germany
and Belgium.)
Indemnity to German concerns or private persons
injured by the war.
The guaranteeing of the freedom of the seas.
There were one or two other clauses which
might mean almost anything except anything
good for the Allies. It may sound a trifle
weird, but to the German mentality it might
not be so. Certainly the Chief of Staff states
that these terms were drafted and that they
were the only ones to which he ever gave
his assent. In the last rush, when the Navy
and much of the Army mutinied, and the
Kaiser fled, and the war machine dissolved,
there was no time for negotiation on the
firm and dignified lines proposed. But the
Hun. now that he has got his second wind,
would doubtless be prepared to open dis-
cussion with the old set of ideas as a start-
ing-point if anyone is foolish enough to fall
in with his theory that peace isn’t really
made but is just going to begin to be made.
So there should be interesting events close
ahead.

This was part of a recent Sydney Tele-
graph article on the need for constitutional
reform: —
A London paper the other day spoke of the Premier
of South Australia sending an “ultimatum” to the
Commonwealth. A man may send an ultimatum, if
he wants to, to the man in the moon. The point
here was to show that the Premier of a State of
half a million people could block the construction
of a connecting railway to afford direct transport
from the west to east of the continent because the
State was not given a compensating railway from
south to north.
This is something of an effort in
the way of distortion. S.A. doesn’t
demand the completion of the Soutli-
to-North railway as compensation for
letting a Federal line cross its terri-
tory from west to east. It asks for the
completion of the line as the compensation
agreed on when it handed over the partly-
constructed railway, the sovereignty of a
region larger than N. S. Wales, Victoria and
Tasmania combined, and some 330,000,000
acres of unalienated land. The Common-
wealth power is too restricted, but if it was
possible for it to break a bargain of that
size with impunity, and not only rob the
other party of the consideration agreed upon,
but tax him to help pay the loss on a rival
show, its power would be a great deal too
large. Incidentally, it is in keeping with
the Telegraph’s foolishness to say that “a
man may send an ultimatum, if he wants
to, to the man in the moon.” It has never
been done, and there is no known way of
doing it.

Dear Bulletin, —In his article (B.
27/12/’23) on “My Electorate,” Mr. Bed-
ford says: “Kidmanism is not the work of
an individual; it is a system initiated by
those fraudulent, ignorant old pioneers.” As
an old pioneer I resent such words. Many
of us lost our lives or health opening up
Mr. Bedford’s electorate—men such as the
Duracks, Duncans and Peglers. These
and many more like them were of the finest
type, and only for such men Mr. Bedford
would have no electorate to represent.
Further on he says: “Sheep must employ
white men where cattle-stations may em-
ploy gins.” This is an unworthy insinua-
tion ; he should speak to some of his A.W.U.
supporters about this, not the owners of the
runs. As to squatters employing aboriginals
as stockmen, 'the least we can do after taking
their land away from them is to allow them
to earn an honest living on their native
soil. But how is it that Mr. Bedford is a
strong supporter of a Government that
acquired Dillalah, a sheep-station in his
electorate, and turned it into a cattle-run,
allowing the sheep-fences to go to ruin? And
why don’t they turn some of their State
cattle-runs into sheep-stations and show us
how to do it? All my life I have been con-
nected with stock-raising, and it is wonder-
ful what lots of Government officials and
experts of one sort and another have told
me how much better they would have man-
aged if they had been in my place. Why
don’t Mr. Bedford and others like him go
west and get on the land? There are plenty
of chances, and it is much easier to make a
start now than it was in the early days.
Personally I can’t understand a strong
A.W.U. electorate that makes its living out
of grazing choosing an absentee writer of
romances as its member. There is certainly
many a hard-working, honest member of the
A.W.U. resident in the electorate who
would know too well what the pioneers did
for the country to throw this insult at their
memory.—Yours, etc., Donald Gunn.

“Bildad” : Sydney may be the Queen City
of Australia, the fastest-growing place in the
Empire, and on the way to be the biggest
mass of buildings south of the Line, and it
may have thrown together 10-1 millions’ worth
of bricks and mortar during 1923, but it has
poor luck with its gateways. A year or two
ago the main western outlet became impass-
able, after long degeneration, and as
fit for traffic as a trench in Flan-
ders. In despair it was very badly
repaired out of loan money at more
than the cost per mile of a new railway, and
is on its way to the dogs a second time. Now
the art of road-making has been forgotten
again, and the mountain road beyond Pen-
rith looks so much like the bed of a dissi-
pated torrent that a suggestion has been
made that it should be abandoned as far as
possible, and that people should take to the
old railway track. Further, most of the
ways out of Sydney are still by punt, and all
the bad language in Parliament doesn’t ap-
pear to accelerate things.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
As the date approaches for Priminister
Bruce to leave Europe for America, the
cables begin to buzz about "trade recipro-
city” with Canada. One interested group
is whispering loudly that what Australia
does for Britain it ought to be ready to do
lor Canada and every other Dominion. But
there is a difference. For one thing the
U.S.A. capitalist sometimes finds it conveni-
ent to invest in Canada; and the Bankers’
Trust Co. of New York estimated that in
1919 alone 200 branch U.S.A. factories were
opened in Canada —partly of course to get
Canadian trade, partly to get the benefit, of
reciprocal trade treaties within the Empire
and partly to reap the advantages of the
“specially-favored nation” agreement which
Canada lias with France.
A demand is made for a Royal Commis-
sion to inquire into the merits of an un-
wholesome row in N.S.W.. Assembly, in the
course of which hon. member No. 1 accused
lion, member No. 2 of systematically spread-
ing a nasty disease that it might bring busi-
ness to his chemist’s shop, and member Two
retorted that member One had the disease
himself. It isn’t a nice business, and it is
difficult to see that the commission could do
anything, no matter what finding it arrived
at. The simple plan, which should clean up
the future, even if the past is decomposed
and hopeless, is to give each member his
remedy against the other in the police court,
and after that in every other court up to the
Privy Council. Legal members should sup-
port this reform to the last shark.
It is going to be an eventful year for Bar-
well. He began it auspiciously by extract-
ing a profuse apology from a Sydney weekly
which had libelled him, but he will find it
less easy to secure a renewal of his lease of
office from the South Aus. electors. They
haven’t forgotten his impulsive remarks
about colored labor for the Northern Terri-
tory ; moreover, he is at war with the
Cockies as well as Gunn’s Laborites, having
taken the stand that he would rather lose
his job than hold it at the caprice of a third
party. Again, the election is to be held on
first-past-the-post rules (the Government has
no use for preferentialism or proportional-
ism), and Labor always gains when the non-
Labor vote is split. A point in Barwell’s
favor is that he lias the courage of his con-
victions, popular or unpopular: his attitude
—rare these days—is “there’s my policy;
take it or leave it.” And the public has more
than a sneaking regard for that sort of
leader.
Last year’s electoral victory, however
it was secured, has put new life into the
stalwarts of Queensland Labor, and lately
the Premier and the Ministers of Railways
and Works had to appear in the dock before
the Trades and Labor Council. They were
charged witli “rampantly unsympathetic”
administration, and with employing Tory
underlings. The most definite count was
that they had been instructed by the last big
Conference to nationalise banking and all
the principal industries. But, in the first
place, banking oomes under Federal law, and,
in the second plac'e, all the banks save one
doing business in the State belong outside
—even the Savings Bank. Also a lot of
Queensland industries are owned in Mel-
bourne. In short, the council practically
ordered Theodore, a mere local or suburban
potentate, to go Sovieting at once. It is the
sort of thing which has driven kings to drink.
It is on the cards that the Lawson-Allan
coalition will decide to increase the number
of Vic. Assembly seats from 65 to 68. The
idea is to provide additional electorates for
the over-populated metropolis without risk-
ing an unholy row with country members.
At present there are 21 city and 44 rural
seats; were the city and suburbs given 25
and the country 43 (Ovens to be wiped out)
a troublesome ghost might be laid for a
season. If the redistribution scheme is re-
jected in April the Ministry will appeal to
the country, and if it comes back victorious
the next Parliament will be a short one.
For members will have to face the electors
again as soon as the mandate to recast seats
has been obeyed. If that dreadful threat
doesn’t put the reconstruction through, no-
thing will.
Westralia, the State which had a diffi-
culty about a renewal loan at the end of the
year, is busy compiling its 13th consecutive
deficit. The Treasurer reckoned on being
£298,683 short for the year, and. as he is
£375,764 short for the half-year, he is doing
well. Piled-up deficit is now £6,286,679.
Already it is suspected that Labor in
Britain will prove as shaky on finance as
the party has always done here. Ramsay
Macdonald got his following of 192 on the
promise of a “levy on capital” or confisca-
tion of capital", which was to produce
£3,000,000,000. This wasn’t to be in the
form of old castles, farms, fishing and shoot-
ing rights, family portraits and ghosts,
perishable merchandise, goodwill of businesses
and the like, but something portable that
could be used in reduction of the public debt.
When details became due it was announced
that the Labor Government would appoint
a committee of financial experts (who are
never Laborites) to supply it with a work-
able scheme for a levy. If it says there is
none and never was one, it is to be requested
to furnish a plan for raising at least as
much money without a levy. Australia had
bitter borrow these experts. No price would
be too much to pay for a committee like that.
The Bankers’ Bulletin, which is “the
official organ of the United Bank Officers'
Assoc.,” is occupied largely these times in
discussing the Commonwealth Bank. “Re-
signations are still coming in,” it says, and
THE DONKEYS.
“The cargo steamer Hanover, of Hamburg, has arrived well laden in Sydney Harbor.”
THE MOTHER: “But if I take your carrots, my children will never learn how to grow
carrots for themselves.”
THE TEMPTER: “But why should they? You ought to let them cultivate their own
great natural resources. Think how beautifully they can already say ‘Hee-
haw!’”
gives prominence to the statement of a cor-
respondent that “employees are losing all
enthusiasm for the welfare of the bank” :
A Board composed of business men would certainly
be an improvement in the sense that it would be a
body to which an appeal could be made; but such a
Board would not be acceptable if it permitted the
continuance of the vicious internal system controlled
by the coterie.
Almost the entire trouble arises from the
failure of the Government to finalise the
arrangements for the future control of the
bank. What it did was to make temporary
arrangements, and it was inevitable in those
circumstances that the man in temporary
charge and the officers by whom he surrounded
himself should be charged with cliqueism. It
can’t be helped now ; but the same thing is
liable to happen again and again in the
future unless there is an independent Board.

Australian champagne was half its present

from 30s. to £2 a bottle, could be had for 10s.
or 12s. 6d. In other words, if the people
were drinking at the old rate the bill per
head would be close on £7, and the differ-
ence represents the extent of the natural
movement towards temperance which ap-
pears to be in progress everywhere but in
prohibitionist America.
From a Sydney union office: —
Certain Red trade-unions, which are horribly un-
finaneial as a rule—it is only the “borjoice” organi-
sations that have comfortable bank balances —have
struck a great idea for remaining in debt, or rather
their bosses have. The bosses assure the rank and
file that the only means of obtaining accurate news
about the Soviet Republic is to send someone to
report. So the necessary funds are voted, and every
few months a “courier” goes on a jaunt across the
world, and comes back to announce that if it wasn’t
for the typhus, the malaria, the famine, and the
lack of soap, machinery, coal, clothing and of the
2000 million pounds sterling which the capitalistic
countries churlishly refuse to lend the Red Govern-
ment, the Communist experiment would be thriving
famously, especially as freedom of speech and print-
ing has been abolished. A feature of these quests
for information is that it is never the industrious
unionist who goes abroad. The return ticket is
always handed to one of a gassy clique who have
been strangers to hard toil for years. Another of
these “couriers” left the other day. Meanwhile
the Trades Hall Association is howling for back
rent from half a dozen “definitely revolutionary”
organisations.
Until a few months ago, when a Laborite
won Kalgoorlie at the Government’s expense,
the Cookies were the most numerous group
in the Westralian Assembly. As a result
of the recent rumpus the number of
accredited Agrarians has been reduced from
18 to 3, four haying been refused endorse-
ment by the executive of the Primary Pro-
ducers' Association, and 11 (including
Maley, titular leader and Minister of Agri-
culture) having sided with the excommuni-
cated quartette. While the factions were ex-
changing the customary pleasantries, Mit-
chell, the Premier, butted in with the clumsy
statement that “35 Country members who
objected to outside dictation have left the
party.’’ This wrung from Maley the an-
guished explanation that he and his 14 fol-
lowers hadn’t “left the party”—they, in
fact, were “the party,” the trio who stuck
to the executive being bogus. His fear is
that the farmers will class the 15 as
“Nationalists,” and “Nationalism” is a
cadaver in the W.A. rural districts. The
chances are that most of the 15 will lose
their seats anyhow, for nearly all the P.P.A.
branches are supporting their executive.
It is mentioned in all seriousness that the
Queensland Government may pass legisla-
tion to compel banks to pay interest on cur-
rent accounts. Presumably this will apply
only to Queensland, though Theodore may
order them to pay interest in all the States
and in Mhoriland and London under pain
of having their Queensland assets conhs-
eated. Some day Australia may get a Gov-
ernment which will remember that banking,
insurance, marriage, divorce, insolvency and
some other matters are Federal business, the
same as customs and quarantine, and will
assert the Commonwealth’s dignity (it any).
But it is long and weary waiting.
London Referee (28/10/’23) prints the
complaint of “a woman who knows, appa-
rently not an Australian, but a good Brit-
isher :
What’s the use of telling- us the Empire ought to
be self-supporting, and that we ought to buy Empii’e-
raised food? Where are we to get it? Every week,
at shop after shop, 1 ask for Maoriland butter,
and nearly always they’ve only got “Danish” or
“English” at 2s. 2d. or more, and that’s out of the
question. And where can you get Australian jam
and tinned fruit and tongues and soups ? They all
want to palm off American stuff, and don’t seem to
know, that California and Chicago are not in the
British Empire. At Australia House you can get
them, jolly good and cheap too; but even at Aus-
tralia House they cannot tell me what shops, if any',
keep the things.
Of course that suggests two queries: (1)
Why not? (2) What is Australia House
for? But it also suggests, what is no
doubt a solid and awkward fact, that the
British shopper expects to get everything
“Colonial” at far less than home-grown
or European stuff commands. Which makes
the immediate value of any moderate prefer-
ence doubtful.
From a Territorienne :
The Federal Public Works Committee has been
getting some picturesque misinformation regarding
the N.T. The manager of a Government battery told
it that the trouble with white men was that they
worked too hard ; in fact, they “became physical
wrecks after 18 months in the Territory.” Well,
Jack Clancy has had 50 years of N.T. life, as laborer
and road-builder for the most part, and it would
be rather unsafe to taunt Jack with being a physical
wreck. The same with scores of other laboring men
who have been here from 10 to 30 years. Oddly
enough, no representatives of this class—-the main-
stay of the Territory-—had been invited to give evi-
dence before the committee. That privilege was
reserved for employers, officials and politicians, whose
opinions were mostly prejudices.
Labor, both in Britain and Australia, is
taking up a subscription for allegedly dis-
tressed Hun children. The sympathy of the
“advanced” section of Australian Labor has
been with the Hun all along. It is a hard
matter to explain, when one considers the
emperor with his “divine right”; the com-
pulsory service army and navy in which the
officers were “gentlemen” by birth, though
seldom by manners; the Prussian Junker
landowners ; the schools where the teachers
were under military discipline; the churches
in which both priest and parson had to
preach the “divine right”; and the Parlia-
ment, wdiere the Lower House had no con-
trol over Ministers, and the Upper House,
or Senate, which really counted for some-
thing, consisted of the delegates of princes,
and legislated in secret. “Advanced” Labor
took this remarkable institution to its bosom
in the early days of the war, and hasn’t got
over the habit yet. It is very perplexing.
The evasive habit is always in evidence
when the development of one of the outports
is concerned. It is admitted that Twofold
Bay (N.S.W.) is one of Australia’s good
harbors, and being situated about the middle
of a stretch of 575 miles between Melbourne
and Sydney there should be a job for a
harbor there without interfering with any old
“vested interest.” The railway (332 miles
of it from Sydney) stops 60 miles from the
port. It begins to be a losing proposition
at Goulburn, 140 miles from the city, and in
the end it is the second-greatest loser in the
State. The terminus is a hamlet because it
is isolated from its port, and the seaport is
an emptiness because there is no line to
bring trade from the inlands. So the Gov-
ernment tries to look liberal and progressive
by proposing the development of power for
manufacturing purposes from the Snowy
River. The manufactured products are pre-
sumably to take the old long road to the old
city. In the north, Grafton and other ports
also want to be joined to the interior, so
there is babble about developing hydraulic
pow-er from the Nymboyda. But when Syd-

HIS CHOICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The British Labor party accuses Mr. Baldwin of
unworthily clinging to office. The Times remarks that
if he had done otherwise, he would have been justly
condemned for deserting his post in time of trouble.”
Which would you rather be —quitter or leech?
A barnacle that ivill not be denied
Its grip on office save when steel’s applied—
One who must needs be seized by scruff and breech
And dragged from tart-shop with protesting screech,
His greed and gluttony unsatisfied,
Or just a coward who trembles for his hide
When enemies the outer ramparts reach,
And bolts in pusillanimous despair,
Leaving his followers to native qui pent?
You cannot tell? Well, ’trsn’t your affair.
Tight places such as these are not for you.
’Tis a dilemma that’s reserved for gents
Conducting jarred and shaken Governments.

Here rugged Lawson stood with shaded eyes,
Watching his people fade into the past;
Here Kendall, loitering, gentle glances cast
On quiet streams and trees and spreading skies.
Strange opposites! Yet one in such good parts
As sympathy and passion for this land
That fired their souls, uplifted them and fann’d
The flames of warm devotion in their hearts.
So do I love, and, loving, sorrow more
That of her sons no statesman worth the name
Uprises now to see beyond her shore
The staring eyes that wait to mock her shame.
One pray’r I have: God guard her from their lust,
Or with their last vain blood damp down my dust!

Early in the financial year the National
Mutual took over the If millions of assur-
ances on the Australian books of the Equit-
able Life of U.S.A., which ceased writing
policies locally many years ago. It quitted
the field altogether by passing over assets,
consisting of the Equitable buildings in Syd-
ney and Melbourne, public securities and
deposits, which “re-insured” its risks. The
N.M.L.A. balance-sheet shows among assets
£723,425 in a trust account in respect of the
transfer, mostly Government securities which
are held by the Commercial Bank of Aus-
tralia as trustee for policy-holders to comply
withU.S. insurance laws. As individual policy-
holders approve of the transfer of policies, the
trust-account assets will be included with the
N.M.L.A.’s own belongings. The Melbourne
Equitable building, by the way, was not
wanted, and was promptly re-sold to another
Australian office, the Colonial Mutual Life.
The effect of the absorption and of the past
year’s operations has been to add £2,310.377
to funds, making them £18,868,242.
In the National Mutual’s revenue account
the amount of “re-insurance” paid by the
Equitable is included in the entry, “Single
premiums, £977,819.” This item obstructs
an accurate estimate of the year’s expense
rates, but in the comparisons which follow
it is assumed that the Equitable transferred
£960,000 of funds, and that the balance of
£17,519 was in respect of the National
Mutual’s own policies, and no allowances
have been made for any costs incurred in
acquiring tin* Equitable’s business: —

The cost-rate was lower than at any other
time, and was more satisfactory because in
only one other year (1920) was the volume
of new assurances larger. The office wrote
13,870 policies assuring £5,584,756 and yield-
ing £234,389 of premiums per year. In the

Applying another accepted method of cal-
culating costs —assuming that expenses in re-
spect of new policies are 10 times greater
than on old —the National Mutual’s old-busi-
ness cost-rate was 7.15 p.e. and the new-busi-
ness rate 71.5 p.e. They are highly satis-
factory figures. Compared with eight years
ago, the difference of nine points in the new-
business costs alone meant a saving of almost
£20,000 on last year’s hardest.
The society is also benefiting by improved
earnings from investments :

Funds are now earning 14s. 4d. p.e. more
than they did in 1015, and on last year’s
figures that meant an addition of £126,900 to
income. These interest rates are calculated
on the net return ; that is, after deducting
rates and taxes, which are now much heavier:

While the smaller outgo in expenses and
better interest earnings have been helping
profits, fewer policy-holders than had been
allowed for have died, consequently much
less than was reserved to meet claims has
been paid away. In his actuarial report
for the three years ended September 30,
1922, general-manager and actuary E. J.
Stock stated that the claims experience was
only 65 p.e. of the expectation. Payments
on account of death were 27 p.e. smaller
than for the previous triennium, though the
amount at risk was one-fourth larger. Com-
pared with the three years ended 1916 settle-
ments on account of death increased 12 p.e.,
but risks were 11 times larger. Consequently,
all factors which produce surpluses—the por-
tions of funds in excess of the amounts esti-
mated as required to provide fully for policy
obligations—are helping to cheapen the net
cost of insurance to the N.M.L.A. policy-
holder. It is cheapened in one of three
ways: the policy-holder has the right to (1)
take his cut of the distributable surplus in
cash; (2) instruct the management to apply
his share to reducing premiums; or (3) allow
the cash bonus to remain in the office to pur-
chase additional insurance, and thus for the
same premiums obtain a larger cover than
had been contracted for when the policy was
taken out. The valuation as at September,
1922, disclosed funds £1,705,497 larger than
the actuary deemed necessary. However, he
considered the recent mortality rate too good
to last, and a quarter-million of the surplus
was reserved as a contingent fund against
claims by death. That left sufficient to buy
24 millions of additional assurance for the
139,557 policies eligible to participate in
profits. The N.M.L.A. now proposes to de-
clare bonuses annually instead of triennially,
and a distribution in respect of last year will
be made at the end of March.
The tally of assets is now almost 194 mil-
lions, compared with less than SJ millions
10 years ago. The following table shows the
nature of investments for a number of years:
1910. 1914. 1920. 1922. 1923.

The very rapid expansion is illustrated in a
striking manner by comparing the mortgage
figures: though the proportion to total assets
has declined 30 points, in volume they are
more than one-third of a million larger. The
mortgage account grew £404,374 last year.
The N.M.L.A. is also the largest shareholder
and depositor in the Fourth Victoria Build-
ing Society, so its interests in mortgages are
much larger than the published accounts in-
dicate. Holdings of public securities amount
to nearly 74 millions.

For many years prior to the war this co.’s
Bsrttrd had practised a wise policy of paying
moderate divs. and of laying-by as much
profit as possible. By 1913 £78,000 of
visible reserves had been accumulated to
help £183,727 of capital. When war con-
tracts gave fat profits—those for 1919 were
equal to two-thirds of ordinary capital—the
directors kept cool heads, and did no more
than lift the div. rate to 14 p.e. Consequently
there are now reserves, of nearly £228,000
helping £112.500 of ordinary capital. There
is also £lOO,OOO of pref. capital carrying
only 6 p.e. To pay this 6 p.e. along with
14 p.e. on ordinaries the co.’s funds have
to earn less than 5 p.e. The co. has, there-
fore, been placed on foundations capable of
bearing surely the worst shocks even the
meat trade can experience. As a result,
while some competitors sustained heavy losses
and have been nursed by bankers and other
creditors since the slump, this one has con-
tinued to distribute divs. on the war-time
scale, and add a few thousands to general
reserves each year after providing for re-
newals. The introductory table and the
analysis of results recorded above, however,
tell only so much of happenings as have been
visible in the published figures. It is prac-
tically certain that during the fat years, and
when extensions of works were necessary to
cope with the boom trade, considerable addi-
tions to plant and premises were charged
against revenue. The published accounts
now show 10 freezing works with a book
value only £49,608 larger than eight had in
1915. Here are more balance-sheet compari-
sons over that period :
1915. 1920. 1922. 1923.

The strengthening of the liquid position in
the eight years has been astonishing. Lia-
bilities have expanded by £192,902; liquid
assets by £257,630. That gives an improve-
ment of £64,728 in the liquid surplus. Add
the disclosed additions to works and plant,
and £114,336 of assets have been put on the
lists since 1915 with the 'help of only £3650
of new capital. That means that in eight
years profits equal to the whole of the ordi-
nary capital have been visibly left in the
business after distributing divs. to ordinaries
aggregating almost as much as their paid
capital. At November 30 the co. held £82,616
of Government securities.

In the 1915 financial year £30,000 of capital
was written off (reducing it to £45,000) to
clear away a lot of froth which had become
mixed with the dotation that transferred
the old privately-owned printing business to
a public co. At the end of the war, when
prices were on the rise, the co. showed hand-
some returns on the written-down capital.
Though the prosperity was quite abnormal,
it and the increase in the value of printing
and other plant prompted the directors to
revise the capital account again. Not only
did they replace the £30,000 written off, but
they added £25,000 more, taking paid capital
from £45,000 to £lOO,OOO in one move. This
bonus issue .absorbed £12,590 of profits which
had been visibly accumulated, the book value
of plant, etc., was written up by approxi-
mately £33,800, and goodwill was taken in
at £7522. Except in 1920, the last of the
wmr-boom years, disclosed net earnings have
failed to justify the printing of so much
scrip. The div. rate has lately been 6 p.e..
so the market values the shares at about
7s. below face value. For the past 12
months net profits returned 7| p.e. on capi-
tal, and the co. may have done a little better
than that. Besides portion of visible profits
having been laid aside in reserves to counter-
balance goodwill—the accounts now show
only £l2Bl of capital represented by that
intangible asset —portion of earnings may
have been required to reduce written-up
accounts. The replacement cost of printing
plant is now considerably less than it was
four years ago, and possibly some of the
values placed on belongings in the recon-
struction have had to be clipped. However,
trading accounts are not sufficiently detailed
to disclose whether allowances additional to
ordinary depreciation have affected disclosed
earnings: the four balance-sheets since the
reconstruction show a reserve for deprecia-
tion of plant and for amortisation of leases to
have grown in this way: £3395, £7410,
£11,744, £17,520; meanwhile, considerable
additions have been made, and the book
value of those assets is now £33,875 against
£41,702 with which the reconstructed co.
started. Movements of liquid assets in de-
tail have been as follows:

The co.’s position is quite snug, of course ;
all except £5OOO of all outside liabilities is
covered by cash on hand. During the past
12 months £lO,OOO of G p.e. debentures were
redeemed. From a market point of view,
the price paid for shares lately lias been a
few pence less than the book value of the
surplus of liquid assets over ant} above all
liabilities after deducting the final div. From
that point of view the buyer is getting much
more than his money’s worth. The low rate
of div. is wholly responsible for the business
being under a market cloud, and competition
is so fierce that prospects of better profits
are uncertain.

Profits are erratic because the co. is nowa-
days active in land-auctioning, and that is
a gamble. Income for the past four years
has been made up in this way:—
Interest, Profit from
Income. Rents, etc. Sales.

Most land-sales are evidently on a t.-p. basis
(land purchasers’ accounts ran into £12,55.'!
at September 30). so interest earnings are
not wholly derived from ordinary mortgage
transactions. That section of the business
is being expanded considerably: £63,018 was
out at the latest balance compared with
£39,506 four years ago. During the past 12
months deposits more than doubled, and the
co. now employs £40,951 of outside money
compared with only £7720 in 1919. Here
are other comparisons :

For many years prior to 1918 the. manage-
ment had been busily engaged satisfying credi-
tors who had been left hungry when the
boom of the early ’nineties burst. The div.
rate has gradually been elevated to 8 p.e. p.a.,
but that is mild considering that there are
book reserves amounting to £42,085 and
£4652 of forfeited capital to assist £42,725
of live capital. Too much depends on the
returns from land sales to regard even 8 p.e.
as assured.
Though deposits are now within a few
thousands of capital, the size of reserves,
makes the security for creditors substantial.
Extracting the final div. from cash in hand,
at September 30 £33,318 of liabilities not
covered by cash assets had the backing of
advances, premises, estates and book debts
valued at £121,000-odd.

The table gives results for the 10 years
since the Invincible Colliery Co. was recon-
structed and Howard Smith’s took an in-
terest. The big shipping and coal concern
became managing-agent, and that assured
adequate financing and also markets for the
fuel. Visibly there lias been nothing fat
about the enterprise, but the colliery has
probably done better than the directors’
statements of profits have indicated. The
accounts are presented on usual Howard
Smith lines; no Profit and Loss statement
is given, the allowances made for deprecia-
tion of plant and coal properties are not
disclosed, and the directors’ report is con-
fined to dividing distributable profits. An
examination of the liquid position throws
a little more light on happenings:—
1916. 1921. 1922. 1923.

Liabilities.. .. 3,588 12,266 2,901 5,490
Surplus .. £6,822 £47,339 £43,517 £53,227
During the seven years in which the co. has
been on n div.-paying basis shareholders
have had 624 p.e. on £104.000 of paid capi-
tal (=£65,000), and meanwhile, after deduct-
ing year’s final distribution, £38,600
has been added to the surplus of liquid
assets over and above outside liabilities.
How much of this £38,600 is accumulated
profit depends on what portion is a fair set-
off against the shrinkage in value of pro-
perties as coal has been dug out, on re-
quirements for the renewal of plant and
equipment, and what risks the co. is carry-
ing with respect to its labor team. The
accounts show £13,887 in an accident insur-
ance reserve, but it is most unlikely that
the colliery is not fully insured through the
usual channels against all claims likely to

The past year opened with a liquid sur-
plus of £40,917 when the final div. had been
extracted. Adding the interim distribution
in May last, the period showed an increase
to £55,827. Coal-selling and the sale of
plant, etc. (if any), therefore, put £14,910
into assets which should be as good as cash,
after necessary additions to, or renewals of,
plant, etc., had been made. The actual net
profit depends on how much of the £14,910
should be laid aside to protect capital
against depreciation of assets. The co.’s
balance-sheet position nowadays is very
snug. At the first balance (1914) only
£3336 of capital was in liquid form; in Sep-
tember last 10s. 2d. per £1 share was repre-
sented by the surplus of liquid assets over
and above all external debt. Assets include
£30,500 of “funds at call” and £13,920 of
Commonwealth loans.

“Old Broker” : The chief feature in Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange life last year was
the heresy hunt after the “advertisers.” In
the ’eighties the same old row was on. Then
the Weres joined with those who wanted big
Alfred Clarke, his partner Wallen, Derbin,
Wilder and others choked off advertising.
John May in those days earned crumbs wait-
ing some of the much-abused circulars, and
in that Avay got his foot on the first rung
of the ladder. Alfred Clarke, intent on
advertising, hopped across the road, founded
a new exchange on the basis of the right to
advertise, and won. The old hands who do
not want newly-baptised members to get into
their pastures have empowered the committee
to decide what is advertising and what isn’t.
Meanwhile, there is humor in the efforts of
some of the old brigade to keep be-
fore the curtain. One youngster who sent
out a polite note to his friends that he had
opened shop was sent to Coventry. Sydney
in the days of Mullens, sen., Jones, L. I".
Bain and others was equally touchy. Joe
Palmer fought the right to issue circulars,
and, like Alfred Clarke in Melbourne, won.
Were’s weekly notes now go the rounds of
the banks and life offices in the form of per-
sonal chats forwarded at the written request
of the recipients. The Exchange Committee
sought to counter it with a publication of
its own ; but as it is not proper for an Ex-
change to boost or damn a stock officially in
a land of bulls and bears, this effusion is a
coldly official affair which, for all practical
purposes, is valueless to the investor. It
hasn’t an opinion of its own, and records
very little beyond directors’ reports and
accepts without question the figures presented
in published accounts. What a shindy there
would be if it dared to comment! Yet
clients want opinions ; and, anyway, it is the
broker’s own funeral in the end if he tips
the wrong horse. Even that Mecca, the
London Stock Exchange, allows its members,
either directly or indirectly, to issue circu-
lars, and permits them also to share corns,
with banks and others who bring business.

One of the most important mining floats
for many years is Mt. Isa Mines,
Ltd., which has suddenly and unex-
pectedly been introduced in Sydney to
take over 50 leases containing about 400
acres of the silver-lead field recently dis-
covered near Cloncurry (Q.). In the be-
ginning the size of the leases granted was
severely limited, but holders soon realised
that comprehensive development could be
undertaken only by a strongly-financed con-
cern. The option-takers for the co.
have had astonishing success in secur-
ing so many of the likely blocks and adjoin-
ing holdings. A feature of the options, too,
is that in only two instances, the Rio Grande
and Black Rock, are leaseholders willing
to take cash: for these two 5-acre blocks
£7OOO cash is to be paid. The share
consideration looks big; no less than 12,250
fully-paids of £2O are to be issued immedi-
ately, and 1000 shares more are to be held in
reserve to purchase other leases. Included
in that lot is the promoters’ cut, and also
1750 shares which are to be allotted as
bonus scrip (seven for 10) to subscribers of
contrib. shares. The 50 blocks as they now
stand are, therefore, given a scrip valuation
of £217,000. The public is invited to take
up 2500 shares of £2O each. Incidentally, the
divs. on 1750 shares are to go to employees.
In ordinary circumstances the price being
paid for the leases would be ridiculously
high, but the promoters have had to negoti-
ate with between 70 and 80 lease-holders
who have been digging out high-grade
material and who have been encouraged by
the very favorable reports by the Mines
Department. Leaseholders, promoters and
employees are to receive £265.000 of sci'ip,
none of which can be dealt in for 12 months
from date of flotation: the public puts in
£50,000 of cash and receives £85,000 of
scrip (£35,000 of which cannot be traded for
12 months), and thus secures practically a one-
fourth interest. When the two leaseholders
take their cash, £43,000, less 2£ p.c. brokerage
and preliminary expenses, will be left for
development. Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd., is to
be a development co. only, and its operations
will be controlled by W. H. Corbould, of
Mt. Elliott fame, and it is also on the cards
that Government Geologist E. C. Saint-
Smith will tackle geology for the co. He
was “so greatly impressed” that in his
official report lie found it “a difficult matter
to use language sufficiently restrained,” and
concluded with the opinion that the “dis-
covery will soon prove to be perhaps the
most important find of metal made in the
Commonwealth for the past decade.” The
prospectus re-prints portion of this report,
and also an impressive list of 130 assays
from different parts of the field and the
smelting returns from numerous parcels
despatched for treatment. W. H. Corbould
also reports for the prospectus; he regards
the property “on surface showing” as "the
best discovery made since Broken Hi 11....
The formation gives the impression of the
possibilities of a very big ore deposit over a
large area.” Malcolm Newman has also investi-
gated, and agrees with Corbould and St. Smith
that the ore-channels should go deep. So Mt.
Isa Mines, Ltd., which practically controls an
area approximately three miles long by a
half-mile wide is, in Corbould’s words,
“something more than a gamble.” The area
may contain a half-dozen or so big mines;
the £50,000 to be put up by the public—it is
certain to be subscribed promptly—will put
the test on the good opinions of the geologists
and mining men.
Two years ago Okes Durack Co. was
formed with an authorised capital of £250,000
to search for oil in the Kimberleys (W.A.).
Altogether £120,000 was subscribed, and
about £19,000 is left. The £lOl,OOO has
gone in this way: Purchase of areas,
£76.005; preliminary and flotation expenses,
£4641; plant, £9468; and development,
£10,527. The bore passed through country
“showing encouraging signs,” and then struck
basalt. It is still in this rock at 800 ft., but
the principals are not disheartened. Mean-
while, the Board is on the lookout for more
capital, and talks of asking the Federal and
State Governments for assistance. The co.
has 120,000 reserve shares, but 25,000 of
them are earmarked for vendor and chairman
M. P. Durack when a similar number have
been taken up by the public. This bonus
issue is a serious obstacle to the raising of
fresh capital.

Great Boulder has purchased the Golden
Zone and Hannan’s North mines, Ivalgoorlic.
A weakly-financed Adelaide co. originally
worked the former, and a well-off London
corporation the latter. Both were aban-
doned, principally owing to high costs, and
also in the case of the Golden Zone because
shareholders wearied of paying calls. In
intervening years both shows have had sev-
eral owners, but, prior to being unwatered
for inspection by the Boulder experts, the.y
had had a long period of stagnation. A fair
tonnage of pay ore is said to be available in
both properties.
* * * *
Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) cleaned up
718 oz. from 560 tons for December, and
there is a good reserve of ore in prospect in
the mine workings. The co. has no treat-
ment plant, and is hesitating whether to buy
an old battery near-by, or to instal a new
one. The December yield will increase the
co.’s cash reserve to about £6OOO. There
are 96,000 shares issued, and the market
price of Is. is less than cash in hand* —all
of which may, of course, have to be sunk in
the mine. Times have changed, though. At
the height of the Hampton Plains boom the
market value of the White Hope, Celebra-
tion, Mutooroo and Pernatty shares totalled
about a million, and not one of those shows
had gold outputs such as the last three or
four from the Red Hill.
* * * *
An energetic crowd has pumped the mil-
lions of gallons of water from the old work-
ings of Fraser’s Central, Southern Cross
(W.A.), and there is now talk of a lode of
great width, going an ounce, standing solid
at the 120 ft. level. The old managers of
the group paid divs. on lOdwt. recoveries by
battery treatment only, so it appears ex-
tremely improbable that they left any big ore
deposits of ounce grade untreated. _ The
Central is worth another trial, but if the
mine does contain anything worth while, it
will take some finding.
* * * *
Banker lease. Marvel Loch (W.A.), until
recently held by the Golden Butterfly Co.,
has responded to the efforts of a party of
miners to the tune of SBoz. from 76 tons.
The nearby Salvation lease, which the Em-
pire Extended a few months ago tested under
an option agreement, and finally abandoned,
yielded the two owners a Christmas-box of
760 z. from 40 tons. In the case of the
Banker, the grade is all right, but the lode
too small for successful exploitation by a
co.

Yuanmi (W.A.) is again idle. Recently a
new arrival from Yankeeland induced a Perth
syndicate to back a concentration process, but
after a few thousands had been spent in plant
and labor operations abruptly ceased. Ihe
official explanation is that ‘‘work has only
been temporarily suspended pending the rais-
ing of a little more capital,” but it is doubt-
ful if sufficient will be found to do any good.
~ Dollying-stoner is not so plentiful as it
used to be in Westralia, but a number of
prospectors are' doing well at Mitchelton.
Mitchell’s show, like others in the locality,
was patchy near the surface, but lie took
a pluiige and went down to 40ft. There
he is now breaking stuff from a 3ft. forma-
tion for the Empire Exhibition. The Lewis
Syndicate adjoining has been tapping small
surface pockets of one ounce to the pound
quartz, and has now decided to sink to 100 ft.
in the hope of repeating Mitchell's luck.
Star Explorations, Ltd., which has min-
ing interests at Kalgoorlie (W.A.) and else-
where, held a meeting in London last month.
Accounts showed a credit balance of £lOBO,
but £6325 was transferred from reserve to
permit £6719 to be written off for deprecia-
tion and loss on investments. Chairman
A. H. Collier considered that shares were
well worth their nominal value of Is.
Tongkali Compound, after a big wrestle
with the Malayans who sold it the long-
kali Compound No. 2 block, Seremban, has
thrown in the sponge. Barrister Meagher
is chairman of both cos., and he arranged the
settlement. If litigation were to continue
there would be six legal firms to feed.
Damages of £17,600 had been claimed ; by the
compromise Tongkali Compound writes oft
£12,000 from a debt of £20,149 owed to it
by the No. 2 Co., in which the vendors were
given free shares. Then No. 2 calls up
£7OOO cash by means of a 2s. call. 11ns
will presumably go into the vendors pockets.
There will be a bit more due, but that can
be settled out of cash in hand. As the call
won’t be in for a while, Meagher and his
pals have committed themselves jointly and
severally for the cash payment. Tongkali
Compound holds two-fiftlis of the shares m
No. 2, so there will be a cross-entry
in its favor. No. 2 has good tin, and if it
distributes divs. soon it will recompense the
Compound for its noble sacrifice of not going
to law. Where the vendors come in is that
with £12,000 less leeway to make up they
get quick divs. out of No. 2, and a biggei
slice of the profits. A suction-cutter dredge
going on to the No. 2 ground is guaranteed
bv the Castlemaine Thompsons to put up
records. Profits ought to be flowing in by
March.
Nawng Pet tin (F.M.S.) lias given the
most effective answer to its critics: a 10
p.c. div. is to be distributed next week. The
Board is so confident now that it is talking
of the prospects of paying ‘‘regular quarterly
divs.”

Bux is awaiting the return of R. M. Boyd
to Melbourne to make doubly certain ot the
attitude of the Hollander to non-nationals
dipping into oil in Borneo. The Hague has
had a tussle with Brother Jonathan over his
entree to a much-coveted corner of the Dutch
East Indies, and the Shell crowd scored all
the points. As care is needed, Boyd will
have to be most precise. It’s a good move to
get both the Hague and the East India offi-
cials into line/before spending a bob. As a
lot of big oil sharks have been pegging around
Boyd and Lyne’s paddocks, Bux will have
to be more watchful than ever for a tight
squeeze.

Within a couple of months development
work should again be in progress on the old
Palmer goldfield (N.Q.). There have been
several desultory attempts in the past, be-
sides a more or less indefinite boring canv
paign assisted by the Mines Department.
A plant is to be erected at the Louisa mine
to pump out the water, and a small mill
will be erected; then it will be seen whether
the Lofiisa shoots are worth the trouble.
In the past they were proved to be rich,
but too spasmodic to give steady returns. J.
Berry, who did the Charters Towers boring
for the Department, is in charge.

The opening up of the Styx coalfield (Q.)
has been very costly. The disturbed condi-
tion of the strata more than offsets the ad-
vantages of having some of the best seams at
shallow depth. No. 2 mine, which is doing
all the producing at present, is located in
highly-folded country, and the 9ft. seam
staggers along like a tramp in a gale. No. 3
shaft, three miles further north, and right
on the main railway line, is promising. A
flat seam 41ft. thick has been cut, and a
bigger seam is expected at about .j/UUit.
Mining should start at the lower depth in a
few months. If this mine opens up well, it
is on the cards that No. 2 will be shut down
as being too costly, although the seam is
large and the coal of excellent quality. Hie
Admiralty has just ordered 2000 tons, but,
owing to the tragic lack of loading facilities
in Central Queensland, the fuel Inis to be
railed 484 miles to the South Brisbane
wharves, with 10s. additional freight chaigo,
and the State mine will get nothing more
than an advertisement.

From Papua: New Guinea Copper smelters
at Bootless Inlet should soon be at work.
Ore has been railed from the Dubuna mine
for some time, and the aerial rope-
way from Wai Wai, on the railway, to the
Laloki mine is now practically completed.
Both mines have a three months’ supply of
ore at grass, and are capable of producing
their full quota at short notice. During the
last few months the co. has put a lot of
work into its railroad and roads, in readi-
ness for the wet season, which, though short,
is intensive. r Flie immediate future of the
central division of Papua depends a lot on
the operations of the co. If the smelters
will take parcels of ore from gongers at a
fair price, there are many low-grade shows
tliat are close enough to pay at £6O or there-
abouts. Settlement having failed to follow
the missionary and the trader, Papua is now
hoping that this big mining proposition will
give it a lift.

Politics being largely suspended
at the end of the year, a theological shindy
is looked for as a diversion. The proposed
reunion of the churches brightened things
wonderfully in England, and a New York
parson threw doubts on the Virgin Birth,
and was followed up by other reverends who
denied that man is a decayed being who has
dropped from better things. The theory of
Genesis is that he fell from the angels, while
that of Darwin is that he rose from the
ape, who fell from a tree. The outstanding
point is that fossil apes have been found
who seemed to be on the up-grade, while
fossil angels who looked as if they were on
the downward track have not been found.
It isn’t much evidence, but it helps.
“FY7”: Discussion on know-alls, military
and otherwise, recalls the late “Count"
OUT OF DATE.
“Look here, Enid, you’ll have to do what I say. I'll
have no petticoat government in my house."
“Petticoat? Bow clever of yon to remember the thing,
darling! I haven’t seen one for years.”
Parsons, as be chose to call himself, an
-Austrian who used to be well known in Tong-
reacli (Q.) years ago, and his pet aversion,
an Englishman called (say) Waddington.
Waddington was a Public School and Uni-
versity man, and advertised the fact with
blatant persistence. It was hard to refer
to anyone of note with whom he hadn’t
schooled, or shot, or fished. One day Par-
sons was reading in the Longreach Club when
Waddington came in and sat down at the
same table. “What’s that you’ve found to
interest you so much?” he said at last.
Parsons looked up from his paper and
beamed sweetly round the group. “I am
reading,” be said, “of a man’s skull they
discovered at a place called Piltdown, in
England. He is in an ancient mine, and
they say he is 30,000 years old. Did you
know him, Vad-ding-ton ?”
"Akran” : Imagination can carry a man a
long way towards the cemetery. I was
with an otticer coming from the Apex to the
Beach at Anzac, when the snipers were work-
ing double-tides. Every dangerous corner
we doubled past, but the otticer was a bit
slow, and, passing one spot, he collected a
ration. I heard the crack as it caught him.
“I’m done,” he said, “it’s all up. I’m bleed-
ing to death.” Knowing the ambulance men
weren’t far off. I hurried away, and arrived
back to find the casualty almost out to it.
“Afraid it’s too late. Sergeant.” he moaned,
“I’ve lost too much.” We stripped him to
dress his wound, and found there wasn’t one.
The bullet had plunked into the water-bottle
at his side, and the moisture had run down
his leg. He wasn’t scratched. Yet I’ll plug
any man who calls him a coward.
“Hamer” : The “coronation” of the Grand
Duke Cyril as “Czar of All the Russias” in
a little room in Paris by a group of Rus-
sian ex-nobles who are now waiters, chefs
and chauffeurs reminds me of the Jacobite
stunt in Britain. As a small kid I stayed
at the house of a distant relation who could
not speak of the reigning house without
growing heated and scornful. In a little
time I gradually learnt what was meant
by “these German intruders”; but the full
force of the creed never broke in on me
until the day I stumbled upon a ceremony
in a shuttered room, where a score of men
with swords drawn were drinking to the
“Queen over the water.” For the next
couple of nights I slept badly, wondering
whether the conspirators would kill me
quickly and hide my remains, or swear me
to fealty so that I would not betray them.
But nothing happened. I daresay that autho-
rity knew all about the cranky little meet-
ings, and regarded them with an amused
tolerance.
“Jim Grahame”: When I was asked the
other day to join a Bur-rns Society it set
me thinking of the little band of 28 Scots-
men who 20-odd years ago decided to raise
the necessary funds to erect a Burns statue
in Sydney. The result of their effort
now stands in the Sydney Domain —
one of the best statues of the poet-
ploughman in the world. Over £1700
was collected within six months, and when
the job was completed there was about £70
left over. After this had been earning in-
terest for some years the survivors of the 28
decided to endow a cot in the Burnside Home.
They raised £1000 besides what was carried
over from the statue fund, and two cots were
duly established and endowed. Meanwhile
the Henry Lawson Memorial Fund has
reached about £300 in over a year of effort.
Surely there is something very wrong with
the Australians. How can we hope to grow
to the proper dimensions if we so scorn our
own products!
“F.A.”: Unlike “Noo Zee”
(B. 20/12/’23) I found
absinthe quite easily pro-
curable in most of the larger
villages and towns of France.
At Etaples and Amiens
nearly every drink dispensed
tasted of aniseed, and it was
the custom to request, madam
to “cut out the dream-juice.”
In 1917, between the Somme
and Ypres salient, a Digger
who had sunk a few gills of
the stuff without being wise
to its peculiar properties,
found himself some hours
later in the boob charged
with assaulting the town
major. He couldn’t give any
description of the enemy he
had put into his mouth
except that it was “white-
looking stuff' tasting like
kids’ lollies.” At St. Pol
some months later I saw a
Tommy gunner lashed to the
wheel, and found upon in-
quiry that he had been sink-
ing absinthe for several days
and was, in the throes of
homicidal mania. I’ve never
heard more awful sounds
issue from the human mouth.
“Oxmead's” literary publican:—
Men never argue so assertively and heatedly about
matters of fact and history and date as where there
are no books of reference and no human authorities
whose judgment is acceptable for settling a wager.
This is why I reckon that one of the most resource-
ful and hardest-headed publicans whose beer 1
ever drank was a citizen named Dave Bonnet, who
hung out his shingle at Broad Arrow (W.A.) in
the roaring mid-’nineties. Broad Arrow was about
as thirsty and argumentative a settlement, as could
be found ; also, it. had stacks of spending silver in
the pockets of its dungarees, for good alluvial was
being worked in the district and money was flowing

breath.”
THE YOUNG M INX: “She did stand it well. If it had been me I'd have taken chloro-
form.”
in from deluded English investors for wild-cat leefs.
But Dave Bonnet was wilier than his brother Bungs.
While they sought to attract custom by importing
flash barmaids and new brands of whisky, Dave pro-
cured with some difficulty from a Melbourne book-
seller the latest edition of the “Encyclopaedia Brit-
annica,” and solemnly stacked the whole 20 volumes
on a shelf below the bottles. The fame of his
enterprise ran far and wide, and whenever an
argument started o’ nights in any of the other
pubs—which was about every half-hour—it always
ended in two cdcksure controversialists and a mob of
attendant partisans making a beeline for the only
place where one or other disputant could be proved
right, unless both were wrong. Bets were paid over-
nightly in Dave’s bar, and the winner naturally
shouted, and men waiting for their turn at Ab-Co or
Lu-Ni kept the ball rolling, and the burst of popu-
larity that Dave’s tavern enjoyed became the talk
of the district. Then some miscreant—l think
it was an opposition Bung—spread a sinister story
that Dave himself was in the habit of browsing on
the Cyclo. after closing hours, and memoris-
ing facts and dates liable to be disputed, and art-
fully steering the conversation next day into some
channel where he could bet on a certainty. It was
a damaging insinuation and there was some talk of
forming a committee to investigate it, but a night
or two afterwards an inebriated dryblower set a
ramshackle cubicle afire in the dead of night, and
the adjacent bar, with its literary treasure as well
as its liquid stock, went up in smoke. That was
the end of Dave’s enterprise. When Sagittarians be-
came locked in controversy after that, they could
call each other liars or they could fight it out; but
appeal to the printed word was no longer possible.
“F.A.”: “Spare Corp's” par re enemy
canines reminds me that I saw only one
dog on Gallipoli. That was when I was
doing F. 0.0. duty in Nov., 1915. Nearly
every- morning when taking a screw round
the panorama from the O-pip I would sight
a large white dog, probably a St. Bernard,
at the same spot —a saphead just below the
Chessboard on the under slope of Battleship
Hill. His presence was sufficient reason to
poop off a couple of rounds at the excava-
tion ; but Towser was wise, and was always
hopping down into the sap before the burst
came. Opposite Quinn’s Post and Bloody
Angle, during the same period, the stillness
of the night was often punctured by the
howls of Abdul’s dogs, but they served no
tactical purpose—we knew who was opposite.

“B.”: Spectacular defiance of authority
was the late Percy Brunton’s ambition in
life. On the arrival of Governor Stanley a
few years back his Ex. was passing along
Swanston-street on his way to Vie. Gov-
ernment House with an escort of prancing-
cavalry, when Brunton, selling peanuts near
the kerb, wheeled out his barrow into the
road and hitched on to the end of the caval-
cade. He hung on only down to the Flin-
ders-street intersection; there the police in-
terrupted the journey. But he had played
his part. The mob, lined up to inspect the
new dignitary, had been moved to mirth by
the appearance of the vehicle bearing the
ridiculous legend: "Percy’s Peanuts are
Priceless: Even Governors Eat Them.’’
“Shod Hand” : Re the slender clues which
often enable Sydney 'tecs to sheet home
crimes (B. 20/12/’23). The Perth men can
do better. When the railway goods-shed
office, containing spirits, tobacco, etc., held
overnight for the following day s loading,
was broken into recently, the only mark left
was a finger-print on the window. The
detective in charge of the case, impressed
S HULLINS AND PENCE,
"The Adelaide-Sydney passenger air service is to

with the importance of preserving this clue
for the departmental photographer, promptly
sealed a piece of paper over the exhibit and
ordered the timekeeper to see that nobody
interfered with it. In due course the lens
expert arrived. lie found the finger-print
obliterated, although the sealing was still
intact. Here was another mystery—unsolved
until some bright intellect pointed out that
the seal had been put on the wrong side of
the glass.

THE LOOK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We ’ad a blinkin’ march on Anzac Day;
Me and me cobber and some thousands more
Marched to the same old tunes the bands still play
As when we ’umped the pack through years of war;
And some was wealin’ civics, Yankee cut,
And some was sportin’ khaki newly pressed,
And some was limpin’ on a leg’ gone phut,
But all ’ad strings of medals on the chest.
A-thinkin’ of me cobbers “over there,’’
The trams stopped runnin’ and the flags ’alf-mast,
I ’card a poor old woman's?, muttered prayer
“0 God, me boy, me boy!”—we floated past....
A crowd of tabbies on a balcony,
Their litt’e ’ankies flutterin’ in the breeze.
And leanin’ from a window, jest to me
She gives the look that brings man to ’is knees.
The sort o’ look that ’Elen must ’ave made
To catch the Digger ’ome on leave in Troy,
That sent the ancient Tommy on crusade
To Palestine where Turkish girls is coy ;
The look like melted butter shot with fire
That drowns a bloke beneath its mellow flood,
And opes the blinkin’ sluice gates of desire,
What though ’e lives to learn ’is name is Mud.
The khaki column ambled up the course,
To where the ’eads was gathered on parade;
Past old Sir Tom, a-sittin’ on ’is ’orse,
We marched to see the Stone of Memory laid,
A hefty lump of granite, smoothly fair,
All ’eaped with bonzer flowers the women bore....
But 1 was dreamin’ of ’er sunlit ’air,
And wonderin’ if I’d see ’er any more.

“T.P.”: A North Carlton man was fool-
ishly watching the looting mob at work in
Swanston-street, Melbourne, during the pre-
Cup police strike, when a gang of raw
specials incontinently charged the onlookers,
and this particular one went down with a
dislocated kneecap and a badly twisted leg.
A capable-looking young woman passing by
rapped out an order to some bystanders:
■‘That man is badly injured; bring him to
this recess!” Ripping up the seam of his
trouser-leg with a pair of scissors, she skil-
fully manipulated the limb, snapped some-
thing into position, requisitioned handker-
chiefs, tore off her own underskirt, impro-
vised bandages, replied to advisers with "I
am qualified,” and fixed things up generally.
Finally she sent a man to ’phone for an
ambulance; and then she faded out. Later
on in the examination ward of the Melbourne
Hospital a surgeon said, “Good job you struck
a doctor on the spot, old man, or you might
have been on your back for months. This
is a fine bit of work; you'll do.” The North
Carlton man now carries part of a new silk
underskirt in his pocket, and is looking for
an unidentifiable angel with some letters
after her name.

“R. 8.”: The London ’bus conductor cer-

(B. 20/12/’2?>). I remember an occasion
after the Armistice, when I playfully com-

of his conveyance were unconscionably hard.
His twinkling < e dwelt for a moment on
the pronounced—not to say violent —pattern
of my shirt-cuffs. “It’s naht the seat,

adjustment is possible, so that the long-
standing difference may be settled. I believe
it is the oldest and most important differ-
ence in history. If it could be settled I
fancy all the sects would re-unite automati-
cally. When one considers the polite and
friendly meeting of the two leaders in the
Book of Job, and how well they worked to-
gether, it seems to me that they are much
more likely to agree than two wild-cat
churches. I speak, of course, exclusively of
the dignified Hebrew Satan of the Old Testa-
ment. The low creature of the New Testa-
ment, a multitudinous creation something
like frogs, who occasionally lived inside bad
women and dubious swine, should be ignored.

“Schnorrer”: The most interesfing Aus-
tralian contribution to the controversy
aroused by the split amongst American reli-
gionists over the question of the Virgin Birth
was made by Rabbi Cohen, of Sydney; but
none of the dailies published it. According
to this chief priest of the Great Synagogue
the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception
is based mainly on the prophecy in Isaiah
vii, verse 14. In the original Hebrew of
that verse “almah” is the term used, and it
was translated in a slovenly way into the
Greek “parthenos” (a virgin). But “almah"
is quite distinct from “bethulah.” which is
Hebrew for “virgin”: “almah,” in fact,
merely signifies ti damsel or'girl. The birth
of Jesus is acclaimed by the religious Gentile
as a fulfilment of prophecy, but, according
to the Hebrew authorities, that prophecy
merely grew out of the mistake of a trans-
lator.

“Billo C.’ : Edward Gibbon Wakefield was
not the only early benefactor of S. Aus. who
came into conflict with the criminal law in
the picturesque way. John Jeffcott was an-
other. He -was a brilliant young Irishman
who qualified as an English barrister. Then
he fought a duel and had the bad luck to
kill his man. Apparently influence got to
work, for he was bundled off to Sierra Leone
with the job of Attorney-General of that
colony, where he probably had nothing to
do but mop the perspiration off himself and
reflect on his impetuosity. However, he
stuck it out until influence again, or, pos-
sibly, a recognition of wasted usefulness,
procured him the same billet in Tasmania.
Thence in 1836 or thereabout he got a second
shift to the infant S. Aus. with the appoint-
ment of first Judge of the newly-established
Supreme Court. Here he found squabbles
of all sorts raging among the few officials,
and he swung a willing shillelagh himself,
though amid it all he set a fine standard
of dignity and efficiency for liis court.
Among the wrangles was one regarding the
capital site, though Light had already laid
it out where it now is. One faction wanted
it moved to the Murray mouth. To get first-
hand evidence. Jeffcott made an expedition
to that spot, where he was unluckily
drowned. By a fluke, his portrait aud copies
of his private correspondence only compara-
tively recently came into the possession of
the Adelaide Public Library. The letters
make the liveliest of reading, written in the
old-fashioned courtly but trenchant manner;
but they are deemed so personal that, even
after nearly 100 years, they are accessible
only by special order. By the way, "Wake-
field also contributed to South Australia a
hard-headed nephew, who graduated through
the mounted police, but. having a turn for
business, became one of the earlier managers
of the big Elder-Smith Company. He never
showed any more aptitude for fine art than
that, despite his Christian names of Salvator
Rosa.
“Topee”: I seem to remember a contro-
versy some time since in The Bulletin
about the derivation of
“swinging the lead” as a
synonym for malingering. I
forget the verdict, but the
argument reminds me that,
after being connected with
hospitals for years and find-
ing that medical terminology
has so far failed to provide
a really imposing term for
this ill, I. while on tropical
service, evolved the word
“plumboscillantosis.” It was
my first conscious attempt at
word-coinage, and I had to
wait weeks for a chance to
use it. Then one day the
P.M.O. rang me up to know
what was wrong with a man
admitted from an out-station.
I gave him my coinage.
“What?” I repeated the word
joyously. “Oh, ring off. The
——wire's gone wrong again! l»ut ot
course he was a Scotsman —like myself.

“Ex-Finsbury Park" : There is an official
history—“ British Naval Operations in the
Groat War”—written by Sir Julian Corbett,
a barrister by profession and a naval his-
torian of repute, “who had access to every
scrap of information” available about Ins
subject. The book might supply "W lute-
hall” (B. 27/12/’23) with the correct clue
to the sinking of the Hampshire and the
death of Lord Kitchener. In his review of
the third volume, Archibald Hurd, after giv-
ing his opinion that the historian is peculiarly
fitted to sift information and to present an
impartial account, mentions the story that
the Germans gained knowledge of Lord Kit-
cheners intended voyage to Russia owing to
a treacherous communication from England,
and that they forthwith laid mines on the
course which the Hampshire was to take.
What actually happened was that, an anti
cipatiou of the movement to sea of the High
Seas Fleet, submarines were stationed by
the Germans off the British bases. Sir
Julian Corbett, in describing these disposi-
tions. records that “TJ7S proceeded off Scapa,
•md on May 28-20 laid the mines on which
£ Hampshire, with Lord Kitchener 0,,
board, foundered a week latei. Ihe Hump
shire might have escaped the danger by
altering her course; this it had been arranged
to do. but at the last moment the terribly
bad weather caused the intention to be aban-
doned. # *
“Pollin'": It is a pity for the ' sake of
“Cartot"(B. 3/l/‘23) and other sceptics that
our official records about the early months or
the war are not yet available, tor they would
end all the doubts about the movements of the
Australia and the German squadron. So tar
from being ready to descend on our eastern
coast, Von Spec was never nearer Australia
than Samoa, where he appeared on Septem-
ber 14. At the outbreak of war he was at
Bon ape, in the Carolines, waiting for the
N umbers's arrival from America. Gn
August 0 he left Ponapc for Pagan, in the
Ladrones; then he took his whole squadron
and its supply-ships to the Marshalls, and on
August 29 went off to Samoa, the Sandwich
Islands and South America. As he told
his wife in a letter subsequently published m
Germany, he had not dreamt of attacking
Australia, since the Australia was too big
for either or both of his big cruisers; her
mere presence off our coast saved us from
him. One thing he did do, however, that is
not usually known. From the Marshalls he
sent off two auxiliary cruisers, the Kormoran
and the Prinz Eitel Friedrich, to raid Aus-
tralian commerce, as the Emden (which he
had sent off from Pagan) raided Anglo-Indian
commerce. But their commanders were not
of the stuff of Captain von Muller. They
crawled along the Equator, and at last made
a rendezvous in Alexis Harbor, a little north
of Madang. The Kormoran got there first,
was staggered to hear that the Australia was
at the moment only 12 miles away annexing
the Madang territory, and bolted for Guam.
The Prinz turned up at the rendezvous a few
days later, found her comrade gone, decided
the locality was dangerous and never stopped
until she was safe again with Yon Spee in
South American waters. If those two cap-
tains had only been Yon Mullers —well,
imagine the Emden along the Queensland
coast in October, 1914!

Justice Higgins, now on his way to the
Cold Country, once made a unique bid for
the Vic. Premiership—nearly 24 years ago.
Allan McLean had just taken office, and the
House was not enamored of his Ministry.
Egged on by a leading member of the Age
staff, who seemed to be speaking the senti-
ments of David Syme—they were merely
his own sentiments as it turned out —Hig-
gins gave notice of a no-confidence motion,
and took it for granted that the Opposition,
influenced by the Age, would assist him.
But the Opposition, led by George Turner,
said it would walk out of the House if the
thing were gone on with, so Higgins crashed
and withdrew the motion. He was a Min-
ister only once —Attorney-General in the
Watson Government for a few months.
Scaddan’s C.M.G. sounds a trifle ridicu-
lous. It is the most contemptuous decora-
tion given to an ex-Premier of a State for
many a day. Arthur Robinson, Vic. Attor-
ney-General, took a C.M.G.-ship, because the
TED LARD, M.L.A. for Balonne (Q.).
Colonial Office explained that it had to
wait for somebody to die before it could
hand out the K.C.M.G. which he subse-
quently got. Perhaps Scaddan has been
strung on in a similar way.
Lawson will complete six years as Vic.
Premier on March 21. As he is not keen
on any kind of knighthood, lobbyists have it
that there is a P.C. in store for him.
Arnold Wienholt, formerly member for

Moreton in the Federal Parliament, is home
after a year’s lion-liunting in Africa. He
scored good bags, with the use, incidentally,
of Queensland cattle-dogs—they followed the
wounded beasts and located them in danger-
ous country, as well as holding the attention
of the lions. Wienholt has no intention of
tackling politics again ; he can’t see any anti-
borrowing party that he can join, and he
has no use for any other at present. So he
will go back to his stock-growing in the
Fassifern district.
Lewis Cohen, who gets a New Year title
in South Aus., had just retired from the
mayoralty of Adelaide, after holding it for
nine years in all, which is easily a local
record; the first occasion was as far back
as 1890. He was born in England, grew up
in Sydney, started business in Fiji just as
constitutional government was coming in
there, and at 23 was a member of the first
Council in Levuka. In 1876 he settled in
Adelaide, and soon became one of its most
prominent citizens. His chief assets are
boundless energy, strong business sense, a
“carrying” voice and a wide popularity with
all classes.

M. D. CAMERON,
M.H.R. for
Barker (S.A.).
The Rev. Sabine Baring-Gould lived to
be 90 before Death decided to give him a
ca .b —a virile man with an adventurous
mind, a parson by accident who might have
done much better in some other calling.
There is a son in N. S. Wales. Baring-
Gould wrote “Onward, Christian Soldiers,”
some historical books, and a number of
novels, which rather set the fashion amongst
parsons of writing books with heroines who
were “not quite the tiling.” When nearing
the age of 60 he scandalised his daughters by
marrying a girl friend of theirs who was
younger than tne youngest of them. But
even that was away back in another gene-
ration.
Of 14 Agents-General. full-fledged and
acting, who have served Vic. in London in
the last 60 years, McWliae, the present en-
voy, is the only one above ground. The 13
include four ex-Premiers (James McCulloch,
Graham Berry, James Munro and Duncan
Gillies), two ex-Ministers who were in office
in Vic. before responsible government (11.
C. E. Childers and Andrew Clarke), and
several former Ministers (Verdon, Michie,
Taverner and Mcßride). Childers in jiis
spare time was a member of the Commons
and an Imperial Minister. McWhae no doubt
feels a trifle uncomfortable when looking
back upon so many white crosses, and that
may be one reason why he is making ready
to hasten back to his native State. But he
is only 65, and has the temperament of a
youth.
“Xox’s” little snapshot:—
Littleton Groom, the Federal Attorney-General,
can now write after his name, K.C.M.G., K.C., M.A.,
L.L.M., M.H.R. He is hardly likely to add to the
string unless he achieves the coveted P.C. A
politician with a safe seat since about the beginning
of Federation, a Minister who has had more spells
of office than any other Australian, and a man who has
had little to line his brow in his private affairs,
Groom is one of the spoilt children of Fortune. And
the whole of his success has been due to modest and
indefatigable industry in cultivating the right people
and expressing the right sentiments in the way
helpful people like to hear them expressed. His
capacity for platitude and his stony deliverance of
pious thoughts at Anglican meetings are equally
celebrated; but he has never been guilty of any
brilliant achievement in all his 20-odd years of
service. Though he has the M.A. and L.L.M.,
he is not a great lawyer, nor is he by temperament
fitted to be a leader of men. Actually Groom has
missed his vocation. As a dispenser of trite maxims
on the lines of the American Dr. Crane, he would
have been worth a large salary to the Melb. Herald.
“E.F.”: Nobody with a vivid recollection
of the Lord Jersey who was Governor of
N.S.W. more than 30 years ago can think
of him as father of the late Lord Jersey, who
once won £30,000 at roulette at Monte
Carlo. The Jersey this country knew was
the most dismally respectable vice-king in
the business. He had long, weeping whiskers
and a strikingly red tip to his nose. Ilis
serio-comic appearance must have driven his
son and heir to sport and dissipation. Fate
had intended him for an undertaker, who
takes up lay-preaching as a hobby; but acci-
dent of birth made him a peer whom carica-
turists loved.
Peter Bowling, the central figure in the
“leg-irons" incident of 1909 —one of the
tilings which helped to rush the first Labor
Ministry into pow T er in N.S.W. —has dropped
right out; but his companions in the impri-
sonment which followed the chains, Amram
Lewis and Billy Brennan, are still in the
limelight, and have again been re-elected offi-
cers of the Northern Miners' Association.
Brennan, a fiery orator, who lets his gal-
loping words bolt with him sometimes, is
secretary, and Lewis, who is an unemotional
speaker, and not inclined to speechifying in
any case, has been treasurer for 20 years.
A fall from a horse at Apollo Bay (Y r ic.)
has finished the bright young life of barrister
Keginald Hayes, son of R. E. Hayes, K.C.
He was a brilliant youth who got through
matric. without any apparent effort at the
unripe age of 121, and his career at the Bar
promised to be as full of events as his term
of service on Gallipoli. He escaped from
the shambles with six or seven wounds, and
on his return to Australia was put into the
Censor’s office. It was the irony of chance
that he, who knew almost everything about
horses and had ridden them in many parts of
the world, should be accidentally killed by
one standing affrightedly on his chest.
There have been seven—practically only
six—Chief Justices in N.S.W. since the
charter was granted by Britain just 100 years
ago—a long average reign for each, notwith-
standing that most were elderly before they
got the job. Francis Forbes lasted from Oct.
23, 1823, till the middle of 1837 ; James Dow-
ling stayed only seven years; then Alfred
Stephen came in for a long spell, which
continued till 1576. James Martin lasted 13
years until the end of 1884, and since that
date there have been three, including Cul-
len, now reigning, who followed Frederick
Darley. The first two Chiefs have each a
grandson on the six-and-eight side of the pro-
fession in Sydney to-day.
“0.P.H.”: Ramsay Macdonald, so con-
spicuous now in British politics, is no
stranger to Australia. He was here on a
visit as a private member of the Commons
in 1906, and, by invitation, took part in
the celebration of the jubilee of Vic. Parlia-
ment on November 21 that year. I heard
him speak in the Assembly Chamber. The
exclusiveness of the House was for an hour
or so forgotten, and the benches were filled
with ex-members and representative visitors
as well as by the elect of the people for the
time being. Thomas Bent, the then Pre-
mier, beamed on everybody, including Mac-
donald. Nobody dreamt then that Mac-
donald would be reaching out for the Prime
Ministership of Britain in January, 1924:
he struck few of us as being equal to the
best of the Labor men in the Federal Par-
liament of that year, but he has had a great
deal of experience since.
The New Year found the Rev. Septimus
Hungerford still on the roll of the clergy
in N. S. Wales —he will be 99 next August.
Ilis father was a military officer who arrived
in N. S. Wales in IS3O and settled at East
Greta, then known as Farley. Young
Hungerford intended to follow the law, but,
whilst on a family mission to England, de-
cided to enter the church, and in 1853 —
71 years ago—was given his first parish. It
was New England, and was spread over
approximately 30,000 square miles.
Astonished gasp from a Gallery hand: —
In the matter of nursing a constituency, few
politicians show the industry of F. M. Forde, the
blithe young M.H.R. for Capricornia (Q.). Having
occasion to call at Federal Parliament House on
Christmas Day, I found the busy youth hammering
away at a typewriter in an endeavor to compose soft
answers to many constituents’ capricious inquiries.
He has an electorate of some sixty-odd thousand
square miles, and before the Reps, meet again he
will tour his sprawling domain, kissing flocks of
babies and shaking herds of Ancient Inhabitants by
the hand. Postmen who know him develop spinal
trouble at the thought of the loads he prepares
for their backs. This Yuletide, I am told, he sent
out over a thousand Christmas cards in addition to
his staggering daily mail. Every death in Capri-
cornia that gets into the newspapers brings one of
Forde’s classic notes of condolence to the relatives.
He already keeps one typist going hard, but when
he increases his activities, and starts following up
the births and marriages, another mob of Under-
woods will have to be put on the Estimates.

usual Coroner, can
wholeheartedly en-
joy a day at Rand-
wick. On the
morning of an im-
portant meeting,
he surprised the

gaged by suggest-
ing that they might

jumped at the
chance. And the

when lie picked up

A yarn of Bishop Gallagher’s :
When he was a young- priest he used to make
a fortnightly trip to Laggan (N.S.W.), where he
stayed at the old Shamrock Hotel. On one of
those visits, fairly late at night, he was called
upon to act as peacemaker. An Amazonian lady
had recently wedded a small, timid man from Red-
ground, and was showing him who was the dominant
partner. The young priest arrived just as Xan-
tippe was finishing her gentle remonstrance with a
stick. When he had separated them, and lecture 1
them on the sins of intemperance and anger, and
generally poured oil on the troubled waters, he
addressed himself to the bride. “Now, promise me,
my good woman, that there will be no repetition
of this disgraceful scene. Give me your assurance
that there will not be words in the house when I
am gone.” “Your Reverence needn’t be afraid,”
said the lady. “There will be no words. Let him
as much as open his mouth and I’ll settle him.”
“Spenner”: Sydney King, the cocky who
“also ran” for the Ballarat seat in the last
Federal upheaval, is a keen prohibitionist.
Realising the futility of a summer campaign
in the Wimmera, he carries on a mild annual
offensive among the joy-seekers at Portland
(Vic.). A wheezy Ford assists in the good
work. This week it, too, went dry, lolling
against the kerbstone, and thereupon the
ribald passer-by grinned at a strange spectacle
—-sprawled under the machine, a perspiring
King poked his fingers and his whiskers into
various parts of the Lizzie’s internal
economy, while from her sides floated a
banner: “Will drink lift a man from the
gutter?”
“Siemesse”: Digger Chief Monasli was
always the absolute antithesis of the unap-
proachable, self-conscious brass-hat, and as
Chairman of the Vic. Electricity Commission
he remains just as kindly, unaffected and un-
failingly good-humored. I was accompany-
ing him recently on a tour of inspection of
the Commission’s new power-station at New-
port, near which a disreputable punt ferries
vehicles across the Yarra. As our car
approached the punt was drawing in to the
shore with only one cart aboard. There was
ample clearance room, so, as soon as the
tail-plank was lowered, our driver was mov-
ing up, when the punt navigator excitedly
waved him back. Monash, not understand-
ing the delay, put his head out of the car
with a direction to the driver to go ahead ;
whereupon the puntsman became profanely
emphatic that the blanky car would wait
until he gave the sanguine order for it to
proceed. “You’re quite right, old chap—quite
right,” Monash replied ; and he settled down
to recall, without a flicker of annoyance, how
when he was in London demobbing the A.1.F.,
the authorities paid the Diggers the compli-
ment of suspending all the traffic regulations
and speed laws of the big city so far as their
chief was concerned.
“TJramao”: Whatever others may do
Ratana, the Maori miracle-man, does not
use his reputation for money-making. His
secretary says that during the last two and
a half years gifts to the value of £lOO.OOO
from England. America and other parts of the
world have been returned to the senders. The
Post Office has dealt with 140,000 letters for
Ratana, and it is claimed that they were all
replied to. One acknowledgment of benefits
received came all the way from Iceland.
THE EXPLORER'S TREE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Set my name upon this tree.
All the forest ways are kind ;
He who seeks to follow me
Takes the path with easy mind.
Near and far, from town to town
Went the walkers of the plain,
Kept the highway beaten brown
Up the world and back again.
I, for grace of newer ways,
Went alone and went afar ;
And the comrades of my days
Were a mountain and a star.
Little grasses no man knew
Spread a carpet for my feet
And the moon in quiet blue
Turned the midnight homely sweet.
And because God made all trees
Friendly in their shadowing green
Dear familiar mysteries
Always in my path were seen.
You may walk the way I went,
Easy pilgrims of no will,
Finding with a Slow content
All I saw be3 r ond the hill.
Set my name upon this tree;
All the open ways are plain.
He who laughs may follow me,
Knowing nothing of my pain.

“Eldorado”: There is a hole near Lower
Lila, a station on the Warrego (N.S.W.), that is
famous for its gigantic codfish —many tittlebats run-
ning up to lewt. have been caught there. One day
a thirsty person, having no pint with him, proceeded
to imbibe emu-fashion, when a huge pair of jaws
slashed at one side of his face, and so lacerated the
flesh that medical aid had to be sought. To this dav
the party in question will show you the scar that
he carries about as a souvenir of the incident. This
is, I believe, the only instance Of a fresh-water cod
attacking a man. P.S.—lf anybody doubts this let
him drop a line to Major Chambers, manager Lower
Lila station, near Rourke.
THE MILKY'S WAY.
MILKY: “Fresh from the cow, mum —notice ’ow nice an ’
warm it is!”
MRS. MIGGS: “Yes. It’s very thoughtful- of you to 'ot
up the water. Some of ’em uses cold.”
“Hecagus”: Jaclty, our abo. factotum,
had been an inmate of the hospital for some time,
and the day he was discharged and came home 1
asked him to catch a horse for me. “Oh, cripes,
boss, can’t do it,” said he. “Gotter go back longa
’ospital termorrer—doctor bin tellem me he make
it me a plurry outlaw patient now.”
“F. Clinton”:
The manner in which
birds come to earth
varies considerably. A
sparrow flutters down
and seems to back-
pedal with his wings
before making - contact
with the earth. Star-
lings and various
wrens alight in much
the same way. Wag-
tails, peewits and mag-
pies end a short up-
ward flight about a
foot or 18in. above the
landing-place and then
drop lightly upon it.
Ducks and other water-
fowl fly at a slight
angle to the water and
allow first their feet
and then their breasts
to ease their momen-
tum before coming to
rest. Seagulls appear
to float down through
the last few feet above
t h e water before
alighting. The blue
martin, or bottle-
swallow, seems to stop
his flight by gripping
the landing-place with
his claws. His star
turn, however, is dart-
ing into the bottle-
neck of his nest, with
wings folded. How he
manages to pull up in-
side puzzles me. The
lark that side-slips and
spirals out of the, sky
and takes a short,
semi-circular dive is
beautiful to watch, but
the wonderful dive of,
the native-companion
is better still.

“Jimmie Darwin ' : My judgment is that, if
in-some things the N.T. abo. is hopelessly behind
the methods of civilisation, in others he’s a few
generations ahead. It was found that if a man did
him some slight injury, such as muddling him with
alcohol and making free with his lubra, he did not
enter upon the dignified procedure of civilisation-
affidavits, writs, subpoenas, etc. These things had
not penetrated his dark mind : he made himself judge,
passed verdict, and set about execution. It was
the amount of execution wrought that bestirred
authority to make an example.
There was a glaring enough case
for the purpose, in a murder self-
confessed ; an abo. had killed his
man, and his fellows must be
shown how wicked that was. So
tribes were gathered together
from all quarters for due impress-
ing. A hangman was found in
old Ned. The thing went through
all right; but when blacks gather
together m one place there’s a
throb in the air that calls for
some expression beyond watching
a one-man show. It was an occa-
sion for some special celebrating,
and ceremonies began forthwith.
Such a corroboree followed as had
not been known for years, and for
long after local police-officers were
pestered by inquiries from sportive
niggers as to the prospects of
“’nother fellah string ’em up
again—alia same big fellah cor-
roboree?” The illustrative clutch at
throat, the chokings, the rolling
eyes—all this w’ould have turned
a Frenchman green with envy.
“W.P.T.” : Moore’s estate
at Wyndham (South Coast,
N.S.W.) was so over-run with
rabbits that the P. P. Board
threatened action if they were not
dealt with quickly. In the centre
of the estate was a five-acre lucerne
paddock. The crop was cut and
the gates were left open during
the night, until just before day-
light. Result: 2700 rabbits, 10
hares and 4 bandicoots. The rab-
bits were sent to the canning fac-
tory six miles away. Patches of
barley were then grown and fenced
all over the holding; and through
this same plan of leaving the gates
open till a little before daylight,
Bunny yarded himself so effectu-
ally that the pest was completely eradicated and the
estate was responsible for quite a respectable cargo
of rabbit going Lor.donwards.
•‘Country Fed": “Nitric’s” five-yea;r-old
youngster on the wallaby (B. 13/12/’23) was aged
compared with the one that passed my school in
THE CERT.
" Don’t you think that £250 damages for a mere black eye is
rather excessive?”
“it do seem a good bit, your ’Otior. But I was in for the beauty
competition, and that was the first prize.”
Vic. a while ago—in a pram. Judging from a dis-
tance, I should say it wasn’t six months old, and was
the youngest of a family of five who, with Mum and
Dad, had shaken off the dust of Melbourne and were
heading north. First came Dad and the eldest son,
big swags up, walking on the grass at the side
of the road to case their aching feet. About two
chains behind them, on the main track, walked
two little girls, one about eight, the other four,
carrying a small basket between them. Following
the girls came a boy of about 12 pushing baby in
his big pram., which was loaded down to Plimsoll-
mark with blankets, etc. ; and a little sharp-featured
mother, dressed in black, stepped briskly along
beside him, reading aloud from a book. Ninety
miles from Melbourne, and our good boniface found
them starving, the two girls fighting over half a
dried-up scone !
“Jimmy Possum” : Someoue remarked re-
cently that a bucking horse is often the result of
bad breaking-in, and
with that I am in
accord. Several amateur
outlaw-makers I have
known thought they
were shirking their
job if they didn’t put
a flank-rope on the
girth-bursters, and do
everything they could
think of to make the
prads buck. As for
handling, I’ve seen a
young snorter run in,
jerked and whipped
round the yard for
half an hour or so,
and then saddled and
mounted. If the be-
wildered brute didn’t
start to play up
straight away, as
would often be the
the case, a whip would
be applied from behind
to the accompaniment
of shouts and squeals
until, in desperation,
the animal would
either try to get out
of the yard or throw
itself down and sulk.
I know of a case in
which a thoroughly
quiet Stock-horse could
be turned into a
squealing buck-jumper
merely by digging him
in the side of the neck
with the thumbs.
“Lester Way”: The discussion on the
effects of molasses on stock recalls that while the
farmers of -the Atherton Tableland (Q.) are com-
plaining that they can’t get the necessary molasses
to feed their kine through the present dry time,
the sugar mills on the Johnstone River are wonder-
ing liow they can dump the stuff with the small-
est amount of inconvenience to the public. The
South Johnstone mill dug a great pit on the bank
of the river and let the black nuisance dribble into
it until the pit held about 150 tons of the stuff.
Then the river bank crumbled and the molasses
leapt joyously in. killed all the fish in that part of
the river, polluted the water supply of many resi-
dents, caused all sorts of trouble, inconvenience and
expense at the Mourilyan mill (a couple of miles,
downstream), and bestowed upon the whole district
a most execrable stench. Couldn’t molasses be made
a commercial asset instead of a social pest?
“F.A." : "Rivevina’s” high-powered pedes-
trians (B. 20/12/’23) recall Jerry, the abo. mail-
runher who carried the letter-bag twice a week
between Lammermoor station and Prairie (N.Q.), 20
years ago. He was a runner of the unshod variety,
and his toes were gnarled and twisted and buckled
under one another like shingles on a roof. He had
a sidewav kind of gait that, made him look like a
winged jay, but he got over the ground betwen the
station and the town at a five m.p.h. bat for the full
journey of 40-odd miles. Jerry passed out a few
years ago, at 75.

“P.N.D.” : Homing cats is it? On the
opening up of the northern areas in S. Aus. wheat
had to be carted a considerable distance, and one
particular cocky that 1 know had to transport his 5u
miles. On one of his trips his wife suggested that he
should take half a dozen cats with him and liberate
them in the wheat stacks at Burra. They were
securely fastened in a bag and dumped on top of the
load. Cocky saw that they were there O.K. at the
halt for dinner 10 miles along the track; but on
camping for the night, after a further 15 miles, he
found they were missing, having apparently fallen
off. On nearing liis farm after four days’ absence.
Cocky saw a peculiar object shuffling across ins pad-
dock, making a direct lino for his homestead. On
investigating he found the six cats all alive, hut stag-
geringly weak. Although secured in a wheat sack,
they had travelled at least 10 miles (perhaps con-
siderably more) after the manner of a miniature
caterpillar tractor. I am that cocky’s son. Father
never parted with the sack in which the journey
was made. He exhibited it at his clearing-sale in
1908, when, with its eloquent evidences of rough
handling, it commanded a good deal of attention
bpt not quite so much as the 40-gallon keg of bed
that he turned on.
“Fitzwilliam”: While the telegony scrap
is going on I'd like to throw this- incident into the
ring. An acquaintance of mine went as a young
man to Japan, where he stayed five or six years
before re-visiting Australia. On this visit he met
an Australian girl, whom he married,, after a very
hasty courtship, determined by the length of his
furlough. They went together to Japan, where the
children —four of them—were all born. The mother
was unable to nurse the eldest, who was provided
with a Japanese amah. I have recently seen the
family, and it is certainly a fact that the eldest
is so pronouncedly Japanese in feature that he can
easily pass for one, while the others are of a
distinctly fair English type. There can be abso-
lutely no suspicion as regards the lady ; apart from
any other considerations, the eldest boy was born
eight months after she went to Japan, and in the
little country town where she lived before marriage
there were no Japanese.
LOOKED TOO FATAL.
BILL: “Hullo, Horace, you conic back! I thought you was going
to do yourself in by jumping over the Gap?"
HORACE: “So I was. But when I crawled over the railings and
looked down at the water ' n’ rocks, it bloomin’ near fright-
ened me to death."
“Mat. Med.”: “Borom” is very much
astray in his assertion (B. 20/12/’23) that the
sedative effect of tea is due to the caffeine it
contains. Caffeine is a cardiac stimulant, and is
described in Squire’s “Companion to the British
Pharmacopoeia” as “a valuable heart tonic and diure-
tic.” Anyhow, who said tea had a sedative effect ?

“Bynoe”: We were mustering along the
bank of the Flinders (O.) and decided to camp on
the sandy bed of the river. After tea the discussion
naturally proceeded to alligators, and in due course
we turned in. In the middle of the night Cormvall
discovered a leak in his mosquito-net—at least, the
mosquitoes did, and apprised him of the fact. Not
being able to remedy the matter, he decided to camp
with Ledlie for the remainder of the night, and
sneaked under his net on hands and knees. Ledlie
woke up ; and as a result of that awakening, created
a record in shifting camp. Up that way now it is
considered bad taste to talk about alligators and then
crawl under a man’s net in the middle of the night.

“Broome”: The piscatorial councillors
should come up here to the nor’-west coast for sport.
The kingfisli—so-called, but I think he is of the
mackerel species—offers more fight on the end of a
good line than all the rest of the fish in the four seas
round Aussie. Measuring anything up to sft. Gin. in
length, and with almost a round girth, gradually
tapered, stiff fins and broad, bifurcated tail, he is a

tower of strength and a streak of lightning. In the
water he is the terror of the shoals of small fry;
on deck, mind your toes —I’ve seen one bitten off ; off
the frying-pan, Fisha da Chips couldn’t offer you a
more tempting piece de resistance. And this reminds
me that some of the Council have lately been discuss-
ing the kingftsh as an acrobat. Our GO-ton schooner
was at anchor, and all hands were busy opening and
cleaning pearl-shell, when one of these fish leapt from
abeam and passed clear across the deck and landed
headforemost in the whaleboat hanging in the
davits, staving in a plank. We got him. Again, while
1 was sitting on the cabin-top of a 45ft. lugger, a
mate of his lordship leapt from for’ard of the jib-
boom, narrowly missed the fore rigging, shaved both
masts, hit the cabin-top (not my side), slid off,
struck a Malay on the head and continued on to
where he came from.

Bernard Cronin’s vegetable patch:—
“D.F.” (B. 13/12/’23) remarks that mangroves
are not popularly supposed to flourish south of Bass
Straits, and to that extent questions the exactness
of the local color in my .recently-published “Salvage.”
I have, notwithstanding, a distinct impression of
mangroves in the locality of the Pieman River.
Anyway, what it a mangrove? The scrub mangrove
is quite a tree back from the coast. On approach
to the ocean it assumes a dwarfed, “horizontal”
appearance; and in the tropics it runs to the inulti-
rhizomous and silcker-tree types. Without investi-
gation it would be impossible for a casual visitor
to sav dictatorially that mangroves do not grow in
specified localities. For alight I know the patch
I spoke of may be an isolated importation. I do
not claim that mangroves are indigenous to the
Speck. Anyway, if Shakspeare could give Bohemia
a sea coast, surely I can give Tasmania a few man-
groves without doing much harm to literature.
“Pat Bushie”: A few lines from “Nature
Studies in Australia” (edited in 1903 by William
Gillies, M.A., and Robert Hall, C.M.Z.S., F.L.S.),

for the benefit of those who have lately been canon-
ising the starling:—
It is one of the sins of the starling that it
has helped the sparrow to frighten away small
useful native birds. The starling has already made
good its footing in Australia, and there is much
reason to fear that it will become too plentiful....
The starling e ats larvae innumerable, and is doubt-
less a friend of the farmer. With the fruitgrower
the ease is different. In those districts in which
the bird is thoroughly established it destroys the
fruit to a very serious extent. Like the sparrow,
the starling must be kept in check. Even in a moist
climate like England the bird works havoc among
the fruit, but since it seeks to quench thirst as well
as satisfy hunger the danger is tenfold in our hot
climate.
“Wink”: How does a snake build its
nest? Near our annual camping-spot at Macedon
(Vie.) this year, in heavy, gravelly ground, we
noticed several new holes. Thinking they had been
made by mice—they were too narrow for rats to
use —we gave them the hot-water treatment, and
this quickly brought forth three black snakes. Had
these reptiles ejected the original burrowers, or can
snakes poise on their own tails and use themselves
as gimlets?
“Bioko”: The entries are not all on the
one side of the ledger. The mouse has done a
friendly turn for the
northern Vic. cocky,
notwithstanding that
in 1917 it polluted his
food and water supply,
poisoned his horsefeed
and played the deuce
with his seed grain
and stacks of “pooled”
wheat. Beyond all
this the little chap
cleaned up hundreds
of thousands of acres
of cultivation ground
that had bushels of
wild oats to the acre
lying on the surface.
This performance was
repeated to some extent
in 1922. Both times
it took a lengthy
search to find in a
stubbie paddock a
wild oat that had re-
tained its kernel after
the mouse plague had
vanished, and all the
land yielded many
more bushels of wheat
to the acre than it
would have done with-
out the aid of Little Longtail.
“Jobber” : Pardon me for butting in, but
the crack shots recently quoted by members of the
Council remind me of an incident that happened
many years ago, when my beard was black, and
which, for sharp shooting, has not been approached
so far. Two of the Todhunter boys, on Wambiana
station (N.S.W.), were out on the run after wild
pigs, which were as plentiful as ’roos in those days.
The boys separated, and when Syd was aiming at
one grunter another came with a blackguard rush
out of the scrub, and went clean between his legs,
taking with him tile young fellow, who hung on
like the good horseman he was. The other boy
arrived in time to see his brother disappearing
“piggy back.” Without a moment’s hesitation he
took aim and let fly. The pig fell, shot under the
shoulder, and the rider merely toppled off and came
up smiling.
“Walimac”: While travelling through
Gippsland (Vic.) I saw an excellent idea for driving
hungry sheep through thick scrub. Each dog had
two small bells attached to his collar, and the effect
this had on the sheep was wonderful. The noise oi
the bells made them think that the dog was close
all the time, and there was no difficulty in getting
them along. Remarkable, too, w r as the effect the bells
had on the dogs. As soon as they were taken off
the dogs would retire under the waggon. The drover
told me that even if your tyke becomes tired and
lazy the bells will have a lightning effect on him—
especially if you attach them to the other end.
“Moe” : I have heard crocodile-hunters say
that the approximate age of an old-man croc, could
be determined from the horny ridges at the base of
the tail, each ridge representing about 10 years.
There seems to be something in it, for one croco-
dile in a N. Queensland private collection, of a
known age of 40 years, had four ridges, while
another, whose age was worked out at about 30 years-,
bad only three. The largest number of ridges of
which 1 have ever heard was about 20, which would
put the owner’s tally at 200 years, and though I
have inquired extensively among experienced hunters,
none cou'd beat this. And yet it is said that many
crocodiles live to the age of 400 and more, and
that 300 is ordinary.
* * * *
“X2X” : I will back the shell of the oyster
when it comes to inflicting permanent and painful
wounds. There seems to be some sort of virus,
either on the shell or in the oyster juice, which,
on getting into the blood system, sets up an irri-
tating inflammation accompanied by outbreaks ex-
treme v difficult to heal. I have known men to
suffer from these afflictions for five or six years,
every possible treatment being tried without success.
In extreme cases the virus seems to cause a general
outbreak all over the body, manifesting itself first
as a red rash, on the surface of which there appear
tiny pustules that finally become confluent.
“IJ3” speaks from the inside: —
“Riverina” (B. 6/12/’23) says the argument re
the late Jack Howe's shearing tally of 321 will never
be settled, I oueht to be able to settle it. the
tally was correct and was cut in less than eight
hours, for this reason —Jack Howe never went on to
the board until after all the others had started, and
when the last knockoff whistle sounded was always
home in his tent, which was invariably pitched
about half a mile away from the shed. His wife
accompanied him each -shearing season. “Riverina
says that the sheep were selected and even bellied.
How manv shearers in the old blade days would
belly-wool 321 sheep in one day for another shearer?
Fancy any man working practically a 1 day belly-
woolling for another man who would receive payment
and a big count, while the belly-wooiler would have
no count for the day! And what would the
boss of the board be doing, anyhow? Even if 321
sheep were belly-woolled, would the man doing them
hold each sheep on the board, without being noticed
by other shearers, until Jack Howe was ready for it?
No—he’d have to put them all back into the catching-
pen, where Howe would have to And them:
and a man -shearing 321 sheep in eight hours wouldn t
want to waste much time feeling for the jumbucks
with their bellv-wool off. (Incidentally, Jack Howe
sharpened his shears after completing each and every
sheep—-which meant a good deal of lost, time in

the eight hours.) As for the sheep being selected,
does “Riverina” mean they were hand-classed and
driven into one particular pen for Howe to catch
from? If “Riverina” knows anything about hand-
drafting and penning-up sheep to be shorn, he knows
that some of the other shed-hands and shearers
would notice the selecting going on; and does he
think they would stand such a thing? “Riverina
concedes that Howe was undoubtedly a champion
blade-shearer, but says he had equals. As a matter
of fact, Howe proved himself to be absolutely the
world’s champion blade-shearer and had no equals.
As for Harry Livingstone and Jimmy Power, both
of them were well known to Howe. He had worked
in sheds with them and he just played with them.
He could work along steadily and cut them out by
50 and 100 sheep as he liked—and dance a break-
down on the board in front of them before going-
home. Jack Howe was really never extended, and
he did not work at his top even in getting his
321 tally. If he was placed beside his fast-working
rival guns, and a stranger was asked to pick out
Howe, nine times out of ten he would be wrong,
for Jack never looked as though he was working
for high tallies. These facts —and they are facts—
come from someone who has every reason to know
a thousand times more about Jack Howe than any
other person, and therefore has the right to speau
and be believed.
OUR HORSEMEN.
[For The Bulletin.]
These nights are fired with passion
And shot with many lights
That search the sky and flash on
Dark slopes and wooded heights.
All paven roads are riven
With freighted carts and cars,
Where youth so urged and driven
Forgets the kindly stars.
These days are bleared and blatant
And flushed with florid wiles;
The power of youth lies latent
Along the measured miles.
But how we loved the star-maze
In scrublands dark and wide,
The magic of the far-ways
Our horsemen used to ride!
Through streets they rode at random,
Carefree and weather-tanned;
They drove the flying tandem
And dashing four-in-hand.
Ere sunlight kissed the gables
Of steep and shingled roofs
There echoed from the stables
The matin song of hoofs.
All outland tracks were dusty,
All inland roads were new ;
The waking west was lusty.
The east was fair to view,
When forth they rode to measure
The miles beneath the sun
By hope of hidden treasure
From reef or gravel won.
When fortune served them badly
They raised their swags to tramp;
Astride once more, right gladly
They rode from camp to camp;
And while with fate they gambled,
No wheels of days like these
Whirred past them as they ambled
Against the fragrant breeze.
Through trackless wilds they quested—
New blaze-marks on old trees —
Steep hills they climbed and crested
To gaze on plains like seas.
Across the open spaces
They cantered side by side;
The sunset on their faces,
They knew the world was wide.
How good it was to thunder
Down that fair stretch of road,
What time the slopes of Brundah
Above the timber showed!
To hear the steel shoes falling.
Guess what the quartz would yield,
When golden days were calling
The rush to Grenfell field !
Then came the sleepy ramble
With sheep throughout the day,
Down laneways to Coonamble
Beside the Castlereagh.
Behind them hours of leisure,
Before them months of work,
They turned away from pleasure
And faced the dust to Bourke.
The stockman’s fields of battle
Have heard their whips resound
Against wild storms of cattle
That broke their camping-ground;
On days past understanding,
And nights of hot unrest.
They still were overlanding
From out the great North-West.
Red war has raged and written
Long chapters scored with black.
Their ranks were sorely smitten.
But. healing time brings back
Calm thoughts of men stout-hearted
Who braved the long campaign;
But many a horseman started
Who rode not home again!
Their wives and mothers kissed them—
Bold riders called at need :
Perhaps the old tracks missed them
That now give little heed ;
But in the radiant spaces
Where horsemen galloped long
With sunshine on their faces
The wheels of progress throng.

are an ideal born in the
inventive brain of the late
J. B. Dunlop, who in 1888
realised that imprisioned air
meant absence of vibration
and shock. His aim was
resiliency _ just the resil-
iency tyre manufacturers
the world over are trying
to bring into being through
the agency of Balloon tyres.
Only extensive road tests
will demonstrate whether
this new phase of motor
tyre construction__really a
revival of the principle of
the old-time Dunlop bicycle
tyre of 1890, which was
about 2¥' in diameter as
against If" in use to-day_is
going to prove a commerc-
ial propositon and one that
will be generally applied to
autocar practise. Time will
tell! One thing is certain
_the Balloon tyre of to-day
is an experiment. When
this Company is satisfied
that they mean better ser-
vice and represent full val-
ue for the outlay then, and
then only will the Dunlop
Co. sell them to their
tens of thousands of
patrons. In the meantime
await developments.
The Importance
Notice to Motorists!
PRESENT DAY REQUIREMENTS
In view of the reports in reference to the
benefits promised from Balloon tyres, we
desire to bring the following facts before
the motoring public Recognising after
several years extensive tests in Australia
the advantages of increased air space in
motor Cord tyres, we have already adopted
this undoubted advantage in our standard
DUNLOP
which are considerably larger than standard
sizes adopted by most other tyre makers.
This means increased materials and increased
manufacturing cost, yet Dunlop Cords are
available to-day at a figure that outvalues
other tyres listed near Dunlop prices. Our
tyres represent wonderful value, give re-
markable service and mileage, plus extra
comfort to passengers and increased life
to car. Compare the respective prices and
the sizes and weights of other makes with
Dunlop Cords and see for yourself the
extra value we give. As regards quality
and workmanship nothing better is made
in the world. Do you know that our
adjustment basis against mechanical defects
or faulty workmanship in the course of
manufacture, on Dunlop Cords is 5000
road miles per cover —evidence of our con-
fidence in their dependablity and service!

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
GALLET
The beaches have been calling to the Syd-
ney that isn’t busy packing for the February
and March exodus to the Empire Exhibition,
and Cronulla that is both lovely and just
around the corner is drawing its hundreds.
Mostly a frocky crowd this. There is some-
thing Continental in the Cronulla atmosphere
that imposes an unwritten code of party
manners. The bathing-costumes, sunshades
and surf cloaks are so colorful that the beach
resembles a blaze of tropical horticulture.
It is interesting to watch the yeast work-
ing its changes in these seaside places. A
really fearsome respectability, for instance,
is settling over Harbord, formerly raffish
Freshwater. Beach inspectors of rigidly
Calvinistic views have been appointed to
look after public morals, and only the other
afternoon a couple who were detected in too
loverlike an attitude were warned off, in
spite of the man’s avowed readiness to pro-
duce marriage lines, or fight, or do anything
else necessary to prove respectability. A
couple of young men who had been exiled to
Melbourne for a few years decided, on their
return, to have a look at “old Freshie” ; but
they were only just beginning to express their
opinions of its altered appearance when they
were pounced upon and told that Harbord
didn’t want people who spoke like that.
“You can’t use your Manly language here!”
said the protector of the new suburb’s naice-
ness. _ And Manly, which once regarded its
larrikin neighbor with an eye of scorn, has
to swallow the insult.
A lady on Eiffel Tower heels walked into
Sydney the other day on a .visit. She wears
them six inches long at the least, and on
occasion extends them to seven. And she
says she likes it. It’s a queer taste, to
say the least, but its owner is so satisfied
it is a worthy one that her most vivid war-
memory is of the way she suffered because
she could not get her shoes from Vienna, and
of the sensation caused in a Bond-street shop
by a Tin.-heeled pair she eventually had
made in London.
“A hat for two shillings” was the most
alluring bait at the Empire Fair. Each of
the five women in the Town Hall when this
Letter made its call drifted over to the stand
and tried on the Paris-conquering millinery.
Trimmed with roses, red and pink and yel-
low, their architecture ranged from the wide
and floppy to the small and trig. One sug-
gested Marie Tempest—a pinky red, with a
small Breton-sailorish outline, and a tight
cluster of yellow roses above the left ear.
The local Poiret who had assembled the parts
had a sure eye for line and color massing.
Otherwise the Fair resembled Australia in
its wide, uninhabited areas. The exhibits
were uninspiring, and the Town Hall
attendants drooped with the wistful gloom of
the person who has seen better days.
The Fair and Pageant were organised by
General Ryrie to give a boost to trade within
the Empire. Profits over and above ex-
penses were to go to the Empire League,
but appearances suggested that the General’s
friends and sympathisers will have to organ-
ise another fair to pay the expenses of the
first.
The Goulburn district squattocracy, which
holds its 75th Tirranna Picnic race-meeting
and kindred social fixtures to-day (Thurs-
day) and to-morrow, lost one of the clan
when Gerald Chisholm of Raeburn. Bread-
albane, passed out at Killara last Thursday.
Frank Chisholm of Kippilaw is a brother,
and there is a sister in Maoriland.
Lord Cardigan’s old owner, the veteran
Mayo, who died last week, had a close call
a few years ago, when he lay very ill at
Randwick. A doctor who dropped in on
him then struck the queerest sick-chamber
in his experience. The old man had sur-
rounded himself by all of the remains of
Cardigan and other favorites that he could
preserve. Hoofs and bones and tails were
the only ornaments; and when they couldn’t
possibly pass for ornaments they kept their
place as plain lumber.
Ramsay Pennycuick is walking about con-
scious of an invisible halo these days. His
setting of Masefield’s sea-poem, “I Saw a
Ship A-Sailing,” is being sung as a favorite
encore in London and the provinces by John
Coates. Coates will be remembered here as
one of the big supports of the Quinlan
Opera Co.
Derlwyn, at Elizabeth Bay, is in the hands
of the packers, and in another week or so
the Justice Gordon couple and the children
will hav;e moved to Carnarvon, in Bayswatcr-
road, till the sailing of the Nestor, which
takes little Mrs. Gordon and her two chicks
to England. The Adrian Knox, lady and her
two daughters sail in the same boat.
Armidale has sent to Sydney that rare
bird a tx-ue contralto in the person of dark-
eyed Virginia Bassetti, in private Mrs. J. B.
Fletcher. This predestined singer—her
mother was Welsh, her father Italian—has
been gathering laurels during the concert
season, and on New Year’s Night a Town
Hall filled with haggis and Hogmanay roared
its delight of her singing of tuneful Scots
ballads. There are no melodies in the world
more infectious and hauntingly sweet than
these old Scots airs, and Virginia, whose
deep tones were trained at the Garcia School,
swung from the gay to the grave with a
charm that brought Bonnie Scotland very
close to Sydney.
Amy and May Macleod, of Mosman, are
back from their eight months’ jaunt in
Europe.
A glorious view of Government House
grounds is available to nature-lovers on the
summit of the Astor. Not a blade of the
gubernatorial lawn can hope to remain un-
identified. Unless the new Admiral-Gover-
nor rigs overhead and side awnings Lady
de Chair will never have a chance to run
on to the balcony in her kim to peg out her
best pair of near-silk without being spotted
by her aerial neighbors in Macquarie-street.
An evening wedding that stirred the vil-
lage of Drummoyne last week gave Mildred
Hillman into the keeping of padre Joseph
Hunter, of Lismore. Bride's father, who
skippers the Montoro, had run up all the
bunting in honor of the wedding, so
that the day’s ferry-trippers shared in
the celebrations to the extent of an eye-
full of joy. The bride’s ivory satin and
silver brocade train were trailed up the
aisle of the Drummoyne Baptist Church,
bridesmaid Alice Gurr assisting in billowy
shot taffetas in which pinks and sea-blues
melted into one another. Her helpers were
two tiny pink-clad figures that looked as though
they’d dropped off a Christmas-tree. It
took the local Masonic Hall to harbor all
the guests the bride’s genial father had sum-
moned to the feast.
The clever girl in this Bernice Agar pic-
ture is Mary Hosking, who gained the dis-
tinction of L.T.C.L. for her elocutionary
gifts The examiner wrote to the bril-
liant S’Aus-
tralian (of
course, she’s
from Adel-
aide) compli-
menting her
on her work,
and saying
that in the
whole course
of his examin-
ing life she
was the only
pupil he had
felt justified
in crediting
with the maxi-
mum 100
marks. Mary
was a pupil
of Lawrence
Campbell, and
afterwards his
associate
teacher; she is
also a singer, having studied with Mavro-
gradato at tlie Con. For a time Shaks-
pearean drama lured her, but a studio of
her own, where she trains the young hope of
Australia in a proper veneration for vowels
and final consonants, has now become her
shrine. Newcastle is to have the clever
young woman as its elocutionary adjudicator
at the town’s next Eisteddfod.
Nellie Leach drops a 1924 greeting to
Sydney from Baker-street, London W. She
has just finished a 10-weeks’ season in a
show called “The New Stunt.” Minnie Love
was in the same cast. Nellie is now busy
making records for a gramophone co.
Pen-woman Isabel Ramsay was tendered a
welcome-home party by fellow-scribes Blanche
D’Alpuget and Isabel Gullett last week. A
corner of the Winter Garden of the Australia
sheltered the gathering, every second woman
of which pinned her aura on with a fountain-
pen. The reason of the tea-drinking wore
black frocking and millinery that looked at
once dangerous and dignified. With her
came Mother, and Mrs. David Benjamin
(Freda Sternberg’s sister) from Melbourne
—Mrs. Dave made a hit in tobacco-brown
raiment topped by a close-fitting hat of the
same hue, from which dripped a side veil of
filmy mesh that became a long, long trail
a-winding round the wearer’s throat and down
over the back of the left shoulder, finishing
just about the region which is subject to
indigestion. Mrs. Monty Grover flung a
15-minute smile on the party from the depths
of a wide straw hat with roses upon its
brim.
Glen Carron, the James Abigail home in
Mosman, is to be the new address of the
Morven seminary, in future to be known as
“The Garden School.” The Morven was run
under the Theosophical banner until the
split in that society's ranks ; since then the
Annie Besant influence has been vacuumed
from the doormat. Glen Carron, an enor-
mous place surrounded by acres of grounds,
has been abandoned by the James Abigail
couple because the domestic-service problem
has been found insoluble.
For over 20 years a popular singer of
comic songs in his native city—that’s a
record which even George Robey couldn’t
ignore, and it’s the proud distinction of Syd
Shipway. His was the first voice to tickle
the ribs of the
Town Hall
with a humor-
ous ditty—
that was as
far back as
1901, the occa-
sion being a
Public Service
smoke-o. A
man who could
pioneer humor
in the civic
stronghold was
i r r e s istible,
and the laugh
that he then
raised has
been breezing
around Sydney
ever since
wherever a
needy charity
asked Syd to
supply it. In
the daytime the subject of the May Moore
picture is the accountant in the law firm of
Shipway and Berne. He’s a J.P., too; and
in the evening he sits on school committees
and attends to most of his voluntary duties
as secretary of Ye Idlers’ Club.
How many of the bone armlets that the
flapper is sporting are real and how many
celluloid? A Sydney girl bought one the
other day that looked like white bone em-
bellished with primitive rock carvings. Not
till she reached her flat and was fiddling
about the gas-stove did it flash into
her mind what a pretty life-scar a celluloid
armlet could leave if the lighted end of a
cigarette were knocked against it. Still
thinking her bauble a bone one, but believing
in “safety first.” she dropped it into a zinc
wasli tub and flung a lighted match after it.
For one terrified moment she thought she’d
have to call out the fire brigade. Then
the blaze fizzled out, leaving a charred ring
at the bottom of the tub.
Literary Melbourne and Sydney of two
decades ago recognised Sophie Osmond as
a personality. She passed a good deal of
her girlhood in Maoriland, the cold of
that country being superimposed on the heat
of the Tropics, in which her childhood had
been spent. She was the first woman writer
on Table Talk, and was an active first
member of many of Melbourne’s women’s
clubs. Now she lives in London and keeps
her Australian memories green by writing
novels set under the Southern Cross. Her
latest. “Tonga Bay,” has a Maoriland flavor)
and has just come on the market.
t “London is shivering under the worst
November it has known in 28 years,” writes
an exile. “Cold of the shuddering, running-
nose, chapped-lips kind, with fogs at their
worst, and a general election as sorrow’s
crown of sorrows.” Priminister Baldwin
is credited with saying that he couldn’t
attend some meetings “because he had to
telephone to the Devil to know where he
got his coals.” That set London at zer*o
rocking with laughter. Sydney, at 100-odd
in the shade, wouldn’t shift a muscle over it.
The Spencers, who helped to pioneer the
film trail in Sydney at the Lyceum a decade
or so ago-—you remember how she was adver-
tised as “the only woman operator in the
world”—now own the Chilco ranch, on the
Chilcote River, British Columbia, a real
Wild West place, with cowboys, cattle,
bucking bronchos and choice specimens of
variegated humanity. Of the 70 men em-
ployed. 10 are whites, the remainder being
Indians, Chinese and half-castes. Chilco
consists of 23,000 acres of the Chilcote Val-
ley, and there is an additional 60.000 acres
rented from the Government. The place is
263 miles from the nearest railway station,
but a road made by the old miners is fairly
negotiable by motor-car. The Spencers, who
have been spending a few months on the
property, find the life most interesting, but
have no desire to put in the winter there.
After a short spell in California they will
return for a change to Australia, and should
arrive about Easter.
Mrs. Jane Plant, who died at Maitland
last week in her 90th year, was a native of
Windsor and a grand-daughter of the his-
toric Solomon Wiseman of Wiseman’s
Ferry. She had lived in one house in Bonar-
street, Maitland, for nearly 70 years.
Ivy Jones, who marries her Josh Evans,
of Dalgety’s, early next month, collected a
pile of pretties at the Women’s Club the
other afternoon, when Mrs. England staged
a farewell bachelor-girl tea-party in the
club drawing-room.
The char, had with lightsome chat enter-
tained the lady of the house from early morn-
ing. She had dusted the books with a rever-
ence that did not permit her duster too inti-
mate an approach, meanwhile touching on
the relative values of Cynthia Stockley and
Elinor Glyn. She had stood off and viewed
the pictures and pronounced in favor of
prints from the Tatler. Then the only off-
spring of the family arrived from school.
She’s a healthy little animal, with straight,
nondescript hair, a face like a sheep and
angles all over. The graciousness of the
char, had a hole torn in it by this appari-
tion, and it was quite half an hour before she
rose to the occasion. Then she suddenly
turned a beaming face on the householder.
“You know, Mrs. Flatter,” she observed,
“I wouldn’t say your little Gwynth was beau-
tiful, but she’s what I call classical-looking!”
Lyn Leahy, who is still remembered in
Sydney as “Kay’s, of King-street,” has
launched out in London as a wholesale mil-
liner under the name of “Camelot.” Lyn
in private life is Mrs. Hugh Botham-
Whetham, and was for some time a partner
with Mrs. Bertram Romilly, sister of Mrs.
Winston Churchill, in a Mayfair hatshop,
which is by way of being a rendezvous for
the Smart Set, and calls itself “Lynell’s.”
That partnership has now boiled down to
an “interest,” and the live Australian has
put her personal activities into the wider
field. Ilats for Princess Maud’s trousseau
and also for the new Crown Princess of
Sweden were designed by her and made in
her workrooms.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matthew had his 62nd birthday on Jan. 3, and
there was a small party at Government House in the
evening to drink his health. (And that is very
good, considering he works more with the energy of
16 than of 60, and is at present his own private sec.,
Michael Rogers having gone back to Toril'la.)
Among those at the shivoo were the Whittinghams,
the Holly-Downs, Chandlers, Glynn-Connollys, George
Sampsons and Ross Munros, Margaret Prior, Sheila
Mcßryde, Sybil Irving, Norah Halford and the Ross
Munro girleen, J. Bannister, lan Macdonald and G.
Larritt.
On the previous night Sir Matthew was at the
big dinner, given to Premier Theodore, in Finney’s
Cafe, when about 200 citizens sat round the board
and political differences were sunk to the very bot-
tom of the glass that toasted tall Ted.
Mrs. Theodore has also had several swarrics given in
her honor. Mrs. Robert Joyce, in a setting of
pansies, roses, stephanotis and daisies, with a green
horseshoe over the star guest’s table, had an at-home
at the Bellevue, when about 50 wished Mrs. Ted a
pleasant voyage in the Niagara. She said her thanks
in delphinium-blue marocain and a black satin hat.
Next day Mrs. Gillies poured the friendly' cup in
Lennon’s lounge, and a crocodile-skin bag-purse, with
gold mountings, a silver bag with a comfortable cheque
inside, and a bunch of roses w'ere passed to the
Premier’s wife from her friends. The Gillies lady'
was in white voile and Valenciennes, topped with a
white hat, and Mrs. Theodore sported cornflower-blue
with black cloche.
The Orvieto cleared its decks for jazz the other
night, and the Bob Cowlishaws and the Willises,
Norah Halford, Jean Gross, Jean Graham, Kathleen
Hirschfeldt, J. Bannister and G. L’Estrange were
among those who took part in the subsequent whirl-
ing.
Captain Wiley and the officers and cadets of the
Woodarra ho-ted the Ladies’ Harbor Guild at the
Hillcoats’ home at Teneriffe. The verandahs, screened
with flags, provided dance room, and the Campbell
Thomsons, the George Curtis and P. J. Symes ladies
and a bevy of Brisbane’s prettiest girls were the
guests.
There were some choice frocks on the lawn at
Ascot on New Year’s Day. Mrs. Whittingham was
sheathed in cream satin crepe, with a pink ostrich
feather on her pink hat. Jean Graham had blue
stripes on her white voile, and a white hat on her
fair head. Nancy' McGowan was in pale pink, and
her cloche was ruddier than the cherry. The E. K.
Tullys, Victor Bdls, Glynn-Connollys and the Cam-
eron clan were all in the big roll-up.
To welcome the New Year in, the Whittinghams
arranged a radiant function at May'fleld. Trays
of gifts were carried round, including chic, vanity-
cases direct from Paris. Chanticleer caps adorned
the male headpieces, and the gold and silver decora-
tions, the masses of exquisite flowers, the illumina-
tion of the grounds and the salvo of trumpets, as
well as an orchestra, were something to keep Grannie
“minding it all” for years to come. A marquee
on the lawn held the supper, and there were cards
for those who play and dancing room for those
who jazz. The hostess (she is a daughter of
the late Con Taylor and Mrs. Lumley Hill) was
encased in a gown made entirely of orange-colored
crystal beads —a blaze of light when she moved.
The Cecil O’Beirnes have gone to Sydney, where
they will unship their car and motor to Melbourne;
thence they go by boat to Tasmania, where the car
will be unpacked again for a tour of the Apple Isle.
When they are through with that they will join
their boys in Sydney.
The Henry Ohallands widow went out the other
day at 83 in Maryborough, where she had lived
for nearly half a century. Henry Ohallands was a
well-known contractor pioneer, and the pair arrived in
the Prince Consort in 1864. Six sons survive, in-
cluding Dr. Fred Challands of Mudgee (N.S.W.)
and George Challands of Sydney.

Collins St. Melbourne
On Saturday evening the vice-regal For-
sters, who are both connoisseurs of music,
took along a party to Rigo’s operatic pro-
duction, “Hansel and Gretel,” at the Play-
house, where they were boxed in the side-
circle pens, which have now been mercifully
equipped with cane armchairs in place of
the aforetime hard-seaters. Lady Forster
sported a glittering cuirass of black under a
colorful shawl wrap. Mrs. Pitt Rivers’s
fairness was heightened by Undine-like drap-
ings of palest green, while Mrs. Alf Turn-
bull’s shoulders rose whitely from an inky
sea of jetted chiffon.
The vice-regal Stradbrokes have hurried
down from their mountain fastness at
Macedon to spread a garden fete on the
Stonington lawns in honor of the visiting
Japanese seadogs to-morrow (Friday). Of
course, more than half of the best-known
are out of town ; but a large contingent is
sure to motor or train back to the city for
Japanese Week.
Earl and Countess Harrowby will be
guests of the G.-G. for five days from Jan.
17. The pair were very hospitable to Dig-
gers during the war, and they intend while
in Melbourne to do a little fraternising with
the men they met and their relatives.
So many jazz hostesses arc dashing across
the seas that the shortage threatens to
become acute. Among those who have been
having their steamer trunks made ready for
action arc the Beau Fairbairn pair, who,
with their two babes and Mrs. Beau’s sister-
in-law, Osmunda Hastings, will travel by the
Themistocles. Since the Titian-haired
Osmunda came from England to prospect
life from the vantage point of her brother-in-
law’s Kerrisdale sheeprun, another Hastings
sister has moved into the Royal limelight by
tying up with the Duke of Cambridge’s heir.
Another of the Fairbairn clan to secure a
ticket to London is Betty, the younger
Charles Fairbairn daughter. (Her late
mother was an Osborne.) She is an auburn-
haired flapper fresh from Geelong Girls’
Grammar School, where she shone as one of
the tennis cracks. She is being consigned to
her sister, Mrs. Leonard Wheatley, and will
cross the Equator aboard the Narkunda.
“Mum” is the word concerning a motor-
truck from Healesville which turned two
somersaults on the Black Spur-road and
spilt 18 passengers over the landscape. A
dark veil of silence has descended on the
mishap. On Friday in Christmas week came
the news that a party from a Healesville
boarding-house, conducted by Mr. Somebody,
“formerly of Menzies’ Hotel, Melbourne,”
crowded into a converted motor-truck for an
excursion over the Black Spur. It was
driven by the son of the boarding-house pro-
prietor : and when the brakes proved refrac-
tory somewhere near the Devil’s Elbow, the
driver’s attempt to steer the ’bus into a bank
for safety resulted in the double somersault
aforesaid. A passing motor-car found half
a dozen of the upset passengers—three of
cither sex —lying semi-conscious in the dust,
and a doctor summoned from Healesville
attended to the injuries, “which in no case
were of a serious character.” And there the
story ends. When the Healesville police
tried to get at the names of the spilt and
the cause of the accident there was nothing
doing. A solicitor staying at the boarding-
house advised the bruised persons to refuse
their names, even to the doctor who applied
the plasters. The fact that the premises
were adorned by Gaud Mayor Brunton (who
couldn’t have concealed his presence under an
alias ) put the Melbourne press on the tele-
phone track. But to no purpose. My Lord,
who took no personal share in the catas-
trophe, stated that “for obvious reasons it
was deemed advisable not to publish the
names—there was no justification for pub-
licity.” And now Melbourne is trying to
think what those obvious reasons were. If
Bill and Elsie meet with a jinker accident and
medical assistance is summoned, there never
is an obvious reason for keeping their names
out of the papers. All things considered, it
was a mercy the Gaud Mayor was not among
the heap by the roadside. In that case
secrecy might have been sorely puzzled to
maintain itself.
Those of the Best Dressed who had not
fled to seaside or country for Christmas
Week foregathered at the South Yarra courts
for the club’s Yuletide tennis tourney. Gover-
nor-General Forster looked in on the Tuesday
afternoon. Dorothy Rendall helped the
veteran Norman Brookes to score over the
Pat O’Hara Wood pair in the mixed doubles
finals, and the Brighton girl later added to
her laurels by winning the ladies’ doubles
with Esna Boyd, who had bagged the singles
championship earlier in the afternoon. Mrs.
Pat Wood has not recaptured her old form
since her illness, but she put in some good
work in the mixed doubles. The Clapper-
ton sisters were winners in a lesser doubles
contest.
The passing of soprano Alice Rees will
remind oldtimers of her singing of Mabel in
“The Pirates of Penzance” in 1882. Ori-
ginally from Stawell, Alice sang frequently
at Melbourne concerts, and was given a
benefit in 1879 —the only surviving performer
is fiddler Ortori. now playing in a Melbourne
orchestra. Max Vogrich. who conducted the
Wagnerian selections at the Melbourne Music
Festival in 1882 (Miss Rees was one of the
sopranos), married her, and they presently
moved on to Sydney, where Vogrich led the
Liedertafel and afterwards the Philharmonic.
A long sojourn in New York followed. There
the husband died in 1916, and the widow re-
turned to Australia to surround herself with
a crowd of grateful pupils.
Singer Amy Castles is preparing to seek
fresh laurels in Vienna. Sister Eileen is
also busily filling her steamer trunks, which
will be labelled for America —and there is
a cheerful suspicion that some white satin
and orange blossoms are being bundled in
with the rest of the duds. Both Amy and
Eileen are putting in a lot of their time just
now by the Mentone seashore, where sister
Dolly Finn and her medical husband have
hired a humpy for the hot season.
The Western District had a thrillful time
during the Camperdown tennis week, to
which the squattocracy motored from all
points of the compass. The Tennis Ball at
the Mechanics’ whirled into the sma’ wee
’oors, as a country ball should always do.
Another smart jazz was hostessed by Mrs.
Jack Manifold at the family homestead, and
the final whirl, which was practically a
flapper affair, was staged in the local hall.
xVmong those at the various frivols were the
Ernie Austin pair and daughter Leonore, all
just back from an English trip—Leonore
wearing a glittering half-hoop indicating a
promise to Ken Watson. Other returned
trippers were Susie and Nan Grey Smith
and Lena de Little. The latter, by the way,
distinguished herself on the mail steamer by
descending to the stokehold at Colombo and
stoking for a solid hour.
On the last night of 1923 the H. B.
Mortons turned on a sparkling flow of fox-
trot and frivolity at their Balaclava home,
Wyndham, with the double purpose of cele-
brating daughter Betty’s birthday and wel-
coming-in the New Year. The young people
trotted on the ballroom parquet while their
elders cheered themselves with bridge and
chatter. Mrs. Morton harnessed herself in
black satin curtained with net frothed over
with iridescent beads and hedged in on either
side with blue silken panels; and daughter
Betty radiated in pink satin caged with
gold lace. Before midnight toy hooters and
other noise-manufacturers were unloaded on-
old and young alike, and little 1924 got an
ear-splitting welcome.
This is a Broothorn picture of that bright
little singing-bird, Rita Taylor, one of the
lucky. students of the Albert-street Conser-
vatorium to be chosen for the Melba opera
chorus. She
is an Old Fin-
tonian — and
very proud of
the fact—and
for 18 months
has been hav-
ing her fine
soprano shaped
at the Con.
She has sung in
every produc-
tion staged by
Fritz Hart
during that
period, and
when she ap-
peared as Dido
in the recent
operatic per-
formance of
“D i d o and
JE n e a s” a t
the Play-
house critics
said tilings about lier work that have in-
spired her to continue her studies with an eye
to a stage career. Rita’s father, mother and
two sisters are all as musically inclined as
herself, so at least she doesn’t lack the right
atmosphere in the family circle, where she
is credited with having sung before she
could talk.
Mrs. Sibbald Currie is to convoy her
daughters Madge and Nora on a second trip
to England aboard the Themistocles, partly
because she wants to see her sisters, Mrs.
Calvert and Mrs. Cox, who live in
the Fog, and partly to give daughter
Madge the opportunity of carrying on
her art studies abroad. The three
Murray-Smith sisters all write their
married surnames with a capital C. Mrs.
George Blackwood is also taking a flying trip
overseas. Her object is to place her younger
girl in a Paris school. The elder Russell
daughter, Joyce, will go with them. Since
completing her French polishing course she
has circled the globe under the wing of
her aunt, Mrs. Allan Currie, and the pair
only landed back here in time for the recent
police strike and Cup season. George Black-
wood is not yet able to face the strain of
foreign travel after some months on the
serious end of the sick-list.
Rembrandt is responsible for this photo
of architect Philip Hudson, who with his
partner, James Wardrop, has roped in the
£1000 award for their war-memorial design.
He himself
saw service
with the
Pioneers.
When he eji-
listed in 1915
he left a wife
and two tiny
children be-
hind him, and
on being in-
valided home
with the dawn
of pea ce—
after a halt
at Cape Town
for many
weary weeks
on account of
p n e u m o’'n i a
—lie found it
hard to recog-
nise his babes
in the boy
and girl who
rushed to welcome him. After years of separ-
ation he and his brother met at the Front
quite accidentally, just a day or two before
the brother fell in action. Phil Hudson was
last year elected president of the Royal. Vic-
torian Institute of Architects (of which he
is a Fellow) for the second time. He is
also a member of the Federal Council of
Australian Institutes. He and his family
live at Brighton, where Mrs. Phil (she was
Elsie Yule) has spent most of her life.
Grace Byron Moore and her sister, Mrs.
Ronald Gordon, daughters of the veteran
V.R.C. secretary, are now at Shanghai, and
are returning via Singapore, where they will
visit Mrs. Renton, whom Melbourne knew
as Athol Levey. The pair went through
exciting experiences in the Japanese ’quake.
They escaped without personal injury, but
lost their wardrobes and a waggon-load of
Japanese valuables and curios.
The Eye and Ear Hospital will put money
in its purse as a result of a fancy ball at
Sassafras just before the old year closed.
The local hall was hardly big enough to hold
the crowd. Dame Mary Hughes, who has
blown back for a whiff of the old bush-track
with her William, helped to judge the fancy
frockings. Her husband, looking plumper
and less dyspeptic than of old, drifted in at
the tail-end of the party to collect his petti-
coated half. He was booted and breeched in
his riding togs, and passed himself off as a
“fancy.” The pair will put in some weeks
in their old humpy before he heads for his
lecturing tour in the TJ.S.A. Two of the
East Melbourne Con. girls, Marie Bremner
and Ida Scott, helped a bevy of other young
things to pass round the sandwiches and
coffee in the supper interval. Hospital
matron Jones, with a brace of nursing sisters,
oiled up the mountains to join in the revel.
The dowager Hitehcoek lady, of Pevensey
station, on the Murrumbidgee, is looking
round for a homestead in Toorak, as her son
Charles, who succeeded his father, has
brought home his bride to Pevensey. It is
quite refreshing to discover a modern matron
who is looking for domestic cares in these
days of flats and makeshift diggings—so
many of them shunt home hospitality on to
the shoulders of co-operative maids, and
do their chief entertaining in hotels.
The Victoria League is making a desperate
effort to wipe out the domestic-servant short-
age by importing educated young women.
It remains to be seen whether the importa-
tions will be willing to tackle sandsoap,
scrubbing-brushes or babies. Few of us are
yearning to hand out wages to unpaying
guests who are merely prepared to assist
with the lighter side of housework. In fact,
we have dozens of lady-helps of our own to
choose from, but, unluckily, too many of
them shy at the idea of soiling the hands they
hit the piano with. Few domestic trea-
sures imported to date seem to find their
niche in the kitchen. They are too prone
to look down on their Australian sisters,
and mostly hope to dodge wage-earning with
marriage, overlooking the awful fact that
matrimony is sometimes the one form of ser-
vitude where liberal wages are not forth-
coming.
The Tim Mclnerneys’ South Yarra home-
stead was subjected to a surprise attack on
New Year’s Eve. The invading party, heav-
ily armed with supper ammunition and led
by the J. Hidgcock and Russell Jackson
matrons, was unloaded from char-a-bancs
and limousines, and heralded its attack with
a serenade on the front lawn. It was darkly
suspected that some hint of the raid had
reached the Mclnerneys’ ears, when the
big colonel met the occasion, correctly swal-
low-tailed, while his other half was armored
in glittering jet, and daughter Eileen’s
golden plaits were flown over her best blush
pink georgette dance frock. In an interlude
in the programme of jazz and games, Eileen
Castles and Dorothy Murdoch warbled to a
musical backing supplied by Mrs. Keat-
ing. Edward Mackenzie, who, for some
obscure reason, sported his cherished cairn-
gorm on the chest of a Chinese coolie’s trap-
pings, handed round lucky “sens” while his
sister-in-law, Mrs. J. Mackenzie, contributed
to the gaiety by working a pack of fortune-
telling cards overtime. The whole company
poured on to the lawns before the midnight
hour, imprisoned the colonel and his wife
in a ring, and after singing “Auld Dang
Syne,” cheered them with much vigor.
The Mermaid Repertory Society had a
surprise sprung upon it when Norman Simp-
son and Mary Curtain, two of the brightest
amateur stars in Melbourne, suddenly inti-
mated their intention of getting married on
Monday, then steaming off by the Nar-
kunda on the following day for a Ceylon
’moon. Mary Curtain’s people, who live at
Toorak, are among Melbourne’s oldest
families.
The Richard Casey widow, who has been
on the other side of the Equator for the past
three years, has now signalled her intention
of landing back here early this year. Her
old South Yarra homestead, Shipley House,
having been sold, she will unpack in a Mel-
bourne Mansions flat which sons Dick and
Dermot have already taken possession of.
The Charles Lloyd widow and her insepar-
able pal. Millie Carter, having changed their
minds about living in England (after trying
out the Fog for about nine years), have hired
a flat in Mayfair, South Yarra.
Major Isaacson, who retires with the rank
of colonel, was too old for active service dur-
ing the war, but was given the job of organis-
ing his scheme of teaching trades and new
work to disabled soldiers. He buzzed about
country centres in England and “placed”
the Diggers in all sorts of things, from
cheese-making to engineering. On his return
to Australia he was put in charge of a batch
of deported Huns being sent away from
ex-Cerman New Guinea and other places,
and he has interesting records and signatures
from the men who took over the prisoners at
Antwerp. Isaacson, who was born and bred
in a Vic. Country town, is a clever organiser,
and correspondence with a prominent Brit-
ish politician shows that he formulated the
initial scheme of rationing British civilians
after the style of rationing the army.
. E. J. Holloway, sec. of Trades Hall Coun-
cil, is back from his European mission.
While away he. was put on the reconstituted
\ arsity Council. Holloway will be a trifle
late for nomination to any State seat, if
he has any ambition in that direction, as all
the possible constituencies (forlorn hopes
not included ) have been either allocated or
left to an approved two or three.
A line or two from Adelaide:—
The Glovers had the traditional mayoral gathering
at the Town Hall on New Year’s Eve, with bridge,
food and chatter to while away the time till
12 o’clock struck and there could be cheers and
speeches from the balcony. After that they packed
their bags and went off to Naracoorte to stay with
their daughter, Mrs. Keith Pavy, for a while.
Another New Year’s Eve host was the Register’s
ex-editor, W. J. Sowden, who bedecked his grounds
with electric lights and stuck up a vast marquee
wherein his hundred or two guests could sup and
listen to a flow of many speeches before being finally
waved homewards in the small hours of the morning.
Racing, backed by two heavenly days, boomed at
both Cheltenham and Morphettville. The Bridges,
always keen racegoers, were at both meetings—she
in taffeta and diminutive headgear on both days,
though the vieux rose of Cheltenham gave away
to navy with a glimmer of fuchsia-red at Morphett-
ville. Miss Judge rang the changes between grey,
topped with a black hat, and a maize and brown
frock. There was organdie by the mile —charming
enough some of it, though it is a grotesque snare
to the plump and not-quite-so-youngs. Three of
the smartest frocks had been shaken out of trunks
just back from England—a black and white marocain,
a beaded cinnamon georgette, and an almond green
marocain massed with white embroidery.
Victoria’s Chief Justice and his lady didn’t let
much grass grow under their feet during the
Ormonde’s stay here. The journey from the Outer
Harbor is long enough (and the road bad enough) to
keep most people on board, but they found time to
lunch with the Bridges at Government House and
run down to the George Morphetts at Cummins.
There’s no prouder man in Adelaide at the moment
than newly-knighted little ex-mayor Cohen, and
few showers of congratulations have included a
greater share of genuine ones than his. Among the
pats-on-the-back was a cabled one from the IVeigalls.
The brand-new K.B. and his lady made their own
celebrations with a family dinner that ran to 24,
and another and smaller affair at which the Barwells,
George Brookmans and Miss Judge were the guests.
South Aus. celebrated its 87th birthday on Decem-
ber 28, at Glenelg, where the first Governor, Hind-
marsh, landed from 11.M.5. Buffalo in 1836. There
is still one survivor, who was carried ashore as an
infant from that ship; but anyone born or arrived
before 1850 is now considered a dinkum pioneer.

Royal Cord Tyres Are
Now Made by Three
New Processes Which
H ave Revolutionized
Tyre Making
THE development by the United States Rubber Company of
three remarkable new processes of rubber manufacture now
gives to Royal Cord Tyres a quality never before reached by
any tyre.
1. The New Sprayed Rubber. A method so effective that
a virgin rubber of a quality never known until now is made
available to the world.
2. The New Web Cord. Of Specific application to the art
of cord tyre making. A process of treating fabrics and cords
with latex, making it possible to manufacture tyres and other
articles with a degree of strength hitherto unattained.
3. The New Flat-Band Building Process. A method of
building cord tyres which is revolutionary. Finally and at
last assuring uniform cushioning and resistance in cord tyres.
Taken alone, either of these new discoveries would be regarded as
of the utmost significance, but together they are hailed as the most
important advance in the field of rubber manufacture since the
discovery of vulcanization nearly a century ago.
These three basic discoveries, fully protected by patents in the
U. S. A. and other countries, are the exclusive property of the
United States Rubber Company, makers of Royal Cord Tyres.
Obtainable at all Garages.

Victorious Vauxhall
in the biggest Australian Record,
Fremantle to Sydney.
Leaving Fremantle on Saturday at 4.30 Sydney
time, Jack Burton and W. Bradley set out to break the
Transcontinental Record in a 30/98-h.p. Vauxhall, with
“Castrol” in the sump.
Marked success has been achieved in spite of many
mishaps. The high efficiency of the “Castrol”-lubricated
engine carried them through, breaking first the Fremantle-
Adelaide Record, 1770 miles in 3 days 16 hours 30
minutes, lowering the existing record by 1 day 2 hours
1 0 minutes.
Then the Fremantle-Melbourne Record, 2365 miles
in 5 days 6 hours 20 minutes, lowering by 1 day 7 hours.
And the great final—Fremantle-Sydney, 2995 miles
in 6 days 1 3 hours, making the fine reduction of 4 1 hours
24 minutes under the record of 2 months ago.
THIS IS “CASTROL’S” THIRD INTERSTATE
TRIUMPH IN THREE WEEKS.
On November 29 Norman Smith, in a “Castrol”-
lubricated Essex, broke the Adelaide-Melbourne Record,
and on December 12 the Hobart-Launceton Record.
ALL EXISTING INTERSTATE RECORDS

A good horse generally comes to light at
the AV.A. Turf Club’s Christmas round of meetings.
Last year it was .the English-bred Scorpius, who was
shaping like another Rebus when he had to be thrown
out of work ; in 1921 it was Easingwold; and
Eurythmic flashed into prominence in 1919. In the
first post-war Perth Cup, Macadam was first and New
Tipperary second; the latter a few months later
won the Australian Cup, a performance which Mac-
adam repeated the following year. Others that
distinguished themselves at comparatively recent
AA’.A.T.C. Christmas “carnivals” were Artesian, Lily-
veil, lan Or, Jolly Beggar and Mistico, the last a
lovely galloper of whom tne best was never seen on
A’ictorian courses, although he nearly won a New-
market and beat Magpie at w.f.a. The hero of this
year’s round was the three-year-old Lilvveil gelding
Lilypond, who added a comfortable win in the Perth
Cup to his successes in the Derby and the All-aged
Stakes. He was running away from his field at the
end of the two miles, which he galloped in 3min.
27 2-ssec. His price with the bookmakers was
5 to 1, but he paid nearly 7 to 1 on the s.o. tote
and just on 5 to 2 for a place. Lilypond was ridden
by F. Straker and trained by his owner, .1. Jeffrey,
at Fremantle, where horses get wonderfully well on
a regimen of swimming and gallops on the long
sea-beach. Char, the second horse, is owned by
Dr. Ned Officer, who used to play full-back for Essen-
don (Vic.) in the days of Thurgood and “Tracker”
Forbes.
* * * *
F. J. Marsrlen had a turn of luck iu the
Sydney Tattersall’s Cup, in which his useful little
chestnut Master Cagou (9 to 2) hadn’t to be ridden
out to heat Stony, Wildun, Note (fourth again) and
10 others in 2min. 32sec. for the 12 furlongs. The
winner had the field settled a furlong from home,
emphasising thereby what a good thing El Dorado
would have been for the Summer Cup if a fashion-
able apprentice hadn’t ridden the worst race of his
young life. For Marsden withdrew Master Cagou
from the Summer Cup after El Dorado had beaten
the little chap in a 10-furlongs handicap, and
10 furlongs is not the All Black horse’s distance.
Master Cagou has Bst. 111 b. and the other Bst. lib.
in the Anniversary Handicap, 12 furlongs, to be
run at Randwick on Jan. 26. Fit on the day, and
properly handled, El Dorado would win, but the
doubt at present is whether he will staid.
* * * *
The racing at Flemington on Now Year’s
Day had points of sporting interest. First, the
Standish Handicap proved true to its reputation of
being a blessed thing for the books; then the race
went to a despised representative of the sex which
has gained exceptional glory this season ; lastly,
Una Carlos, the winner, shook her tail at racing
theory and precedent. She had been thought of as
a squib, a mere suburban sprinter, incapable of stay-
ing the “severe six furlongs up the Flemington
straight.” The argument has always been that a
sprinter must be equal to not less than seven furlongs
on a course with a turn in it in order to be worth
backing in good company for the Flemington six.
Vet here was Una Carlos, the accepted non-stayer,
sticking it out very well. She had the extreme
outside position which has so often seemed an
advantage, though nobody can prove where the
advantage comes in, therefore the mare was commonly
declared to have “won it on the marble.” Anyhow,
she won —from another mare (Sonora), who also
travelled on the stand side of the course. And
third place was filled by 10-year-old Blue Cross,
most consistent of sprinters. AVithin the last six
years Blue Cross has scored two thirds in the
Oakleigh Plate (57 furlongs) at Caulfield, a win in
the Newmarket, and two wins and a third in the
Standish. Moreover, the old chap won the flutter
down the V.R.C. straight as recently as last Mel-
bourne Cup Day. AVynette, a pattern of consistency
over longer distances, nearly put the Standish-Bagot
double to the Sex’s account, but at the finish of
the 12-fur l ongs event she was beaten by The Rover
more brilliantly than Switch beat her in the Hope-
toun Cup at Caulfield. She happened to strike AVren’s
horse —an Australian Cup winner who had nearly
won a Melbourne Cup with Bst. 41b. up—in superb
form, and the task of conceding him 81b. was too
great.
. George Tye and Cecil Godby, who trains
tne Tye gees, had a happy hour at the finish of
the V.R.O. meeting. Grotesque, the flying son of
Absurd, had won the Criterion Handicap as he liked,
giving 30 pounds and more to some of the starters.
Then came the mile race for apprentices, and there
was a rush to get on Gadfly, of the Tye-Godby
combination. But when the boys weighed out and
little Ken Godby was seen to be getting the mount,
the odds lengthened. The books evidently expected
Cecil Godby’s offspring to cut a poor figure on
Gadfly. Getting rather the worst of the start, Gadfly
soon was in the lead, and the want of a more experi-
enced jockey was never felt.
* * * *
The hooting of Englefield after he had run
away with the Aspendale (Vic.) Park Handicap
must have come from a push that was illogical, as
well as ill-informed. In one of the bad races he
had run recently, Englefield was backed down to
even money, or thereabouts, whereas on Saturday he
started at 7 to 1, with a 7 to 4 favorite, and two
others at shorter prices than 7’s. Evidently the well-
handicapped horse was not greatly fancied. He
had been eased in his work because on the previous
Saturday he bled after shaping disappointingly.
In such company no supposed good thing from Holt’s
stable would have been allowed to start at 7 to 1.
Gungool came second, four lengths behind the winner.
If the natty little mare can do no better than that
she is not much good.
“Flicker” : Undeterred by tlieir failure to
get a conviction against a punter who, in his excite-
ment at the races, yelled, “A level quid Stiffy wins!”
the S.A. police have run another criminal to earth.
At Glenelg on December 28 a 14-year-old boy was
heard to wager his cousin a level penny that one
particular competitor would win the Sheffield Handi-
cap. The bet was made at noon. A persevering
Hop waited till 3.30 p.m., when the criminal paid
over the money, and then arrested him. Result, £5
fine and costs. Nothing like catching ’em young.
“Wart” : When Lieut. Jack Gatenby re-
turned to the Speck from the war he looked round
for a hunter, and picked out Gwvdion, a gelding
that had failed to win a race. After a couple of
seasons with the hounds, the old chap was handed
over to a trainer, Gatenby having a notion that
there might be a steeplechase in him. There was—
ridden by AVebster, Gwydion won a sequence of nine
steeplechases and jumpers’ flats. Then Gatenby
decided to have him trained for the 1924 Launceston
and Hobart Cups. But he was given a run at the
Deloraine Christmas meeting, with the owner up, and
at the last jump he broke his neck. Nobody but
Webster could win a race with him.
* * * *
“Macmailus”: My entry for the Queer
Coincidence Stakes. A punter at Feilding (M.L.)
races put (as he thought) four £1 notes on his
fancy. A couple of minutes later, reckoning up his
ready monev. he found that he had really paid over
three pound-notes and a tenner; the number of the
last he happened to have kept. The horse he had
hacked duly won. returning a tote div. of a trifle over
£3 a ticket. Going to the pay-out window the
investor received a dozen £1 notes —or what the
clerk thought were such. Actually they included the
identical tenner he had paid in by mistake about
half an hour before. The odds against such a double
error being made must be fairly dizzy ones.
“Bail” : With McDonald in England and
Gregory out of action, Australia is badly off for
bowlers. Of the trundlers now playing" Sheffield
Shield cricket, only three, in my judgment, are
capable of keeping a length and getting wickets
under first-class conditions —the somewhat mellow
lvelleway and AVhitty- and the Victorian, Arthur
Liddicut. AVhitty’s five wickets in Victoria’s first
try against South Australia demonstrate that he is
still capable of great skill and accuracy, despite
his increasing portliness. Kelleway, long" and lithe
and hurling a ball that kicks unpleasantly, was the
main strength of the Ma State in the altercation
with A’ictoria. Liddicut is always difficult to score
off, and rarely bowls a loose one. Contrast these
three with the slow break-spinners, Hartkopf and
Mailey. Both give the batsmen plenty of time to
think, and send in an awful lot of rubbish. That

keeper. He is in

they are sometimes
difficult to play I have
no doubt, but they
don’t deserve the re-
spect paid to them by
unenterprising bats-
men. A sure-footed
dasher like the late
Harry Graham would
make them look cheap.
And the .left-handers
are a poor lot, bar
AVhitty and Horni-
brook. The tall Queens-
lander hasn’t taken
many wickets this
year, but one can’t
quarrel with the judg-
ment of Cem Hill and
A r ic Richardson that
he is superior to
AA’hitty, and that
means that he is a
good deal better than
Macartney, Collins and
Ransford.
It took Victoria six days to defeat N. §.
AVales by 46 runs. Scoring was at the. rate of a
trifle over 225 per diem and boundary hits were as
rare as currants in a yeast bun. It is idle to expect
that the public will go on paying its money for this
sort of linked dreariness long drawn out. The
match between \ r ic. and S. Aus. provided a brighter
display. There was the likelihood of an element of
surprise and an upsetting of paper form in it, too ;
for, as in the game against N. S. AA’ales at Adelaide,
the State that has whipped in for so long in
Sheffield Shield matches looked more than once to b f e
holding the upper hand. The home side, batting
first, managed only 221, towards which PonfUrd’s
81 was the one outstanding contribution. AVhitty
took 5 wickets for 49, a remarkably fine performance
for a well-nourished veteran. The visitors, passed
their opponents’ total with only three wickets down,
an achievement entirely due to the confident batting
of A. Richardson (144) and V. Richardson (100),
but after the pair had been disposed of wickets
fell rapidly and the total realised only 309. Liddi-
cut, with 6 for 65, carried off the bowling honors.
Victoria, in their second essay, improved consider-
ably on their initial effort, with a total of 357.
Ponsford _ was again to the fore with a sterling
contribution of 159, made in 213 minutes, and Love’s
105 was a masterly and invaluable innings. The
Croweaters’ prospects seemed bright when Bowley
and Gould had made 50 of the required 270 without
loss. Then came disaster. Gould was bowled with
the score at 53, and though Bowley batted sturdily
for 30, the two Richardsons went cheaply this time,
Ryder clean-bowling both. Prichard (33) and Towns-
end (20) made an effort to stem the rot, but Ilart-
kopf had them both uneasy, and after they went
the game Was over, except for a little merry and brief
slogging by AVilliams and AVhitty. Hartkopf took
5 wickets for 56, Ryder and AVallace 2 apiece for
24 and 47 ; and AUc. had won their second Sheffield
Shield match by 98 runs.
At the close of a Sydney match limited to
three days a Ma State XI wanted 128 to beat Queens-
land, and had nine wickets in hand. A plucky
partnership between Thompson (134) and Benstead
(54) enabled the tourists to make a draw of it. The
Bananaland batting was much more entertaining on
the whole than that, of the Sydney men, most of
whom carried caution to excess. A spirited excep-
tion was Austin Punch, who got 74 in about as
mam' minutes, this after taking 5 for 33 in an
innings that yielded 309. Two of the regulars having
decided to miss a match, Punch has been included
in the team to meet South Australia. He should
have been picked before. He is one of the few men
now before the public who regard cricket as a
pastime, not as a solemn test of endurance. It
is players of his stamp who should be encouraged
by the selectors instead of the dull potterers who
wait for the loose ball and the tedious merchants of off-
theory and leg-theory, who are digging the grave
of what used to be a grand old game.
* * * *
Queensland’s hopes of getting a Test
match played at Brisbane next season have been
blasted by the Board of Control. The Tests have
been fixed as in other years—that is to say, Sydney
is to get the first and fifth, Victoria the second and
fourth, and S. Aus. the third —but an Australian XI
is to meet the Englishmen at Brisbane. There is
also to be a match against Combined Juniors, and ’some
good may come of it if the age limit is fixed at
21 and stonewallers are barred. A writer .in “Plum”
Warner’s Cricketer (a copy of the very fine annual
edition has reached this office) suggests that Gilligan,
the Sussex fast bowler, will lead the invaders, and
that Tate, Macaulay, Sutcliffe, Fender, Chapman,
Sandham, AVoolley, Hendren and Mead are pretty
certain to be among them. But Hobbs will be a
non-starter.
* * * *
“F.L.11.”: A Melbourne cricket match
has furnished a novelty. AVhile a batsman was
making his stroke, his hat fell down in front of
the wicket; the ball hit the cady and was deflected
from its passage to the stumps. The bowler appealed,
and the umpire’s ruling was “out, leg-before.”
The arguments that followed lasted over supper-time,
but rule 25 says that if a batsman “hits down his
wicket with his bat or any part of his person or
dress” he is out, hit wicket. It is a fair inference
that he can obstruct his wicket with the same
article. The umpire took the view that the hat
was an important part of the player’s dress.
“Hamer”: In spite of “0.R.” (B.
3/1 /’24) there is such a thing as “thrown out” in
cricket. It happened in a Moore Park (N.S.W.)
competition. AVhen the big, middle-aged bowler saw
the diminutive youth who was asking for “middle
and leg” he stared for a moment and then, striding
down the pitch, announced that he wasn’t going to
bowl to such an undersized opponent. “Clear off
and play with the kids” was his ultimatum.. Nobody
liked to interfere, for the big man was obviously in
a fury. Presently the bowler picked the batsman up,
carried him to where his team was sitting near
the boundary and hurled him amongst them, daring
him to return at his peril. The batsman elected not
to go back; and against his name in the score of
that match are correctly inscribed the words
“thrown out.” # * *
“Tren” : In the evolution of batting many
frills and fashions have been lost. It is a long time,
for instance, since the draw shot was played in
Australia, vet in the dawn of the game this difficult
stroke, that got the ball away between the legs and
the wicket, was in the equipment of all artists with
the bat. In the days of underarm bowling and two
longstops “He plays the draw well” was the highest
praise a cricketer could get. Murdoch, I think,
was the last great batsman to exhibit the stroke on
Australian wickets. Trumper, Ranji and other
giants of the recent past played a half-brother fo
the “draw” very well. But. instead of standing
with both feet firm, they got the ball away under
their lifted leg. This is the “dog” shot.
“N.G.”: Bob Roberts, chairman of St.
Geor<re (Q.) Shire Council, used to belong to a
cricket XI that had an unbeaten district record when
it disbanded. It consisted of Bob, his father, five
brothers and four cousins.
Arne Borg, the Swedish swimmer, is tall
and lean, and a student of anatomy has recorded
with pedantic accuracy that his knees go in a bit.
The Scandinavian was on hand with a huge watch
at Manly on Saturday, when Billy Herald flashed
over 100 yards in 55 3-ssec., and Andrew Charlton
left 220yds. behind in 2min. 28 3-ssec. Herald’s
time is an Australian record, but, owing to the take-
off exceeding the regulation 30in. above the water,
it will not be recognised. Borg has had so little
training that it seems impossible for him to be at his
best against Charlton. Still, those who have seen
him in action aver that he will take a power of
beating. , * *
With one eye shut and his countenance
so swollen that his girl would have demanded finger-
print evidence of his identity, Vic (Bst.
shaped up to Bobby Grav (Bst. 5Mb.) in the
seventh round of their fight at Sydney Stadium.
“This round ’ll settle it,” murmured .the small crqwd,
and so it did, but it was Gray who was settled.
A left hook to the chin dropped him for nine.
He was groggv when he got up, and when Kin„
again floored him the referee stopped it. Then
Gray went back to his ice-cream and chocolate
parlor, .that being Iris peaceful pursuit between
raising crops of cauliflower ears.
The South Yarra (Vic.) tennis tourna-
ment was a triumph for Norman Brookes. The
weedy-looking veteran gave a great exhibition of his
uncanny dexterity in the doubles and mixed doubles,
both of which he pulled off with the help of Mclnnes
and Miss Boyd. Partnered by the 'lady champion, he
never faced much opposition in the mixed event, but
Mclnnes, who seems to have slumped considerably
since his return from America (the ancient Rainey
beat him in the singles), was never reliable in his
ground shots, and frequently was the fourth best on
the court. The final, against O’Hara AVood and Haw-
thorn, gave Brookes and his youthful colleague the
trophy with a score of 8-6, 6-2. Miss Boyd pre-
vailed against Miss Addison in the ladies’ singles
after the latter had vanquished the brilliant young-
ster, Miss Mclver; but Miss Addison and Miss Toyne
didn’t surrender to the Boyd damsel and Miss Ren-
dall without a struggle in the doubles. Barring
Miss Boyd and Miss Mclver, there is nothing to write
sonnets about in feminine tennis in Victoria. And
even Miss Boyd is a rather featureless player. She
relies on the strength of her good right arm, hut
rarely brings off a really memorable shot. Her
repertoire doesn’t contain a low volley, a stop volley
or d demoralising toss. She has simply passed with
honors through the school of hard driving.

The S.A. Tennis Association has taken
up an idea successfully started by a suburban club,
a Christmas championship of the State, not compli-
cated by visitors as at the March tournament. This
year showed a raised standard of play, especially
among women, juniors
and (as a detail) doc-
tors. R. V. Thomas
was having a great
final with Hone when
the latter twisted an
ankle and had to re-
tire ; the younger man
i*s certainly better than
ever before, and
Thomas is developing
a much needed staying
power. The long su-
premacy of Mrs. Rowe
is declining, as is natu-
ral considering that she
and her son make one
of the best mixed
doubles. Miss Le Mes-
surier is definitely the
S.A. woman champion,
but others are coming
on.
808 SPEARS ,
Australian cham-
pion cyclist, who
has been riding
brilliantly in
Melbourne.
“Nimslii”: There has been a dust-up in
the British Dunlop Rubber Co., and efforts are
being made to get rid of the du Cros brothers, one
of whom, Arthur, draws £12,000* p.a., free of taxes,
as president. William Harvey du Cros, de-
scendant of a Huguenot who settled in Dublin, founded
the pneumatic-tyre industry, and his six sons helped
it by their successes on the cycling track. They had
all made their debut as racing cyclists before the
invention of the Dunlop tyre, and their astute father
(and trainer) profited hugely by their fame. Only
Arthur and Harvey, respectively third and fourth in
Seniority, attained the championship class, but the
others were pretty good. In the late ’eighties it
was nothing unusual to see the whole fleet in the
one handicap and three of them in the places.
The spectators never cavilled when this happened, but
they had a distinct grievance in the fact that the
brothers all wore costumes exactly alike, thereby
rendering’ identification difficult in a close finish.
Many a dollar bet hung in the balance until the
number-board revealed which of Alf, Fred, Arthur,
Harvey, Willie and George had won. Their father,
soon indispensable on the Dunlop beard, advanced his
sons in the company with clue regard to their re-
spective racing records. Thus, Arthur, the best
track man, became managing-director at an early age,
while his brothers, senior and junior, had to accept
minor jobs. The writer was present at Ballsbridgc,
Dublin, when Arthur, then a stripling of 13, won a
scratch novices’ race from a field of grown men, all
the competitors in the event being mounted upon the
tall “ordinary” machines. They called him “The
Gosling” in those days.
“F.A.”: There is more than meets the
eye in the refusal of the Scottish Rugby Union to
encounter the Maorilanders. The majority of U.K.
amateurs are men in easy circumstances, and as they
are not limited by hard-and-fast residential quali-
fications, they may play in Edinburgh or Glasgow
on Saturday and in London or Cardiff on Wednesday,
or vice versa. I have known a Scot to bog in for
his home club north of the Tweed and turn out a
few days later for the London Scottish. The late
Sievwriglit skippered English XV’s. If the Eng. Union
permits London Scottish players to don the rep. jersey
when the honor has been denied them by their
home union, there is going to be a heap more trouble.
In my opinion the stand adopted by the Scottish
Union is a result of the English Northern Union’s
manoeuvres both in Scotland and Wales. Somehow,
the 13-a-side game in England doesn’t breed
stars. Its agents are ever in search of players who
may be tempted from the older code.
* * * *
“Centurion”: “Nitric” (B. 3/l/ , ‘ ) d'
entitled to his own opinion as to my experience of
Rugby Union and the League game. Such as it is,
it includes 10 years of first-class footer in England
and Australia, including over a dozen “reps.” against
M.L. and N.S.W. “Nitric’s” idea of the wing-
forward shows that he has never seen one. His
admission that he ’verted to the League game puts
him out of court, for the winger was out of N.S.W.
football before the League was spawned. If he
reads my first par again he will get an accurate
impression of what a pukka wing- forward really
was.
PROFIT IN LOSS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My costly days at races, and the wagers lost in town,
AA T hat pleasure they imparted in the past!
I dreamed of Fortune smiling, not of Fortune’s sullen
frown ;
The luck, of course, was bound to change at last.
One thinks of rural rambles with “the nicest thing
on earth,”
AVhen Love’s own rosy glamor clothed the scene:
But memories of races have a special kind of worth —
They whisper of the wins that might have been.
One never misses money if its loss did rapture buy ;
Oh, faith and hope and charity were mine,
And all my golden future, as the horses cantered by,
Was beautiful with corn and oil and wine.
Though costly days at races often worried me of
yore,
They never brought me sorrow or regret:
Their follies and their madness I’m unable to deplore:
The joy of them I never can forget.
’Twixt losing cash or winning it, had I the right
to choose,
I fain would be a winner, I admit:
Yet, next best thing to winning on a gee-gee is to
lose,
Provided he’s a goer and is fit.
AVith costly days at races I have purchased happiness:
Hard Fortune was not cruel, she was kind:
All time, I’m told, is money—they were great times,
more or less,
So I’m counting up the profits in my mind.
VICTORIA.
O.K.


“With due deference”
SIR, there are some things which
one can treat, so to speak, with
familiarity, and some which
command respect. Anyone can
place the bottle of Bordeaux
upon the table, but the crusted
port demands that I, who know
its worth, should bring it. It’s
with something of the same
feelings that I present the Ken-
sitas—the cigarettes which share
the qualities of
vintage port
—luscious and
soft to the
palate, Sir!

Henry Ford, the maker of “tin Lizzies”
and reputedly the richest man on earth,
says he won't run for the U.S. Presidency.
Which is wise, for even if he ran 60 miles
an hour he probably wouldn’t get it. It
is significant that in the land of dollar wor-
ship no really bloated plutocrat has got into
the White House yet.
Gone over the Great Divide, at 76, Jim
Little, one of the earliest miners on the
Croydon field. The dray that took him and
bis wife there 40 years ago made the first
acks from Woolgar to the new field. In
ie boom days he kept the Croydon King
lotel and made money, which he lost again
backing his faith in reefs that refused to be
found.
Charles Cowles, who died at Mosman
(Sydney )a few days ago, settled there when
the populous red-roofed suburb owned only 10
houses. Nearly 60 years ago he set up in
business as a gunsmith in the city
—his first shop was in Pitt-street, on the
site of the present G.P.0., or thereabouts —
and his sons still carry on the old trade.
“Chris” : When George Ryan accidentally
lost his eye while working on the wharves
at Wellington (M.L.), four years ago, he
was reputed to be over 90; and his counsel,
who lately handled his claim for additional
compensation in the Arbitration Court, seri-
ously argued that only for the accident Ryan
would still be brandishing his billhook on
the waterfront. The old chap is half-Dutch
and half-Irish, and hails from S’Africa.
It cost Vic. £2450 to ascertain that por-
tion of Warruambool breakwater was of
faulty design, and that the tittle-tattle about
corruption was unwarranted. Of the total
£652 goes to barrister Gerald Pigot, who
conducted the investigation, £716 to three
counsel (including one lawyer for Deany,
M.L.A., who made the fuss), and the rest
to witnesses and experts. Jack Murray's
yawn was. a lot pleasanter than Deany's
snarl, and less expensive withal.
“Baskerville”: When Vic.'s late Agent-
General Taverner was a Minister of the
Crown, his room was within earshot of an
official who had the awful habit of warbling
at his work. Taverner heard him once, then
sent for him. “You wish to speak to me,
sir?” said the somewhat flustered Caruso.
“Yes,” answered Taverner, “it is rather a
delicate matter, though. I don’t desire to
hurt your feelings, but, do you know, sir”
(and here he raised his voice in mock
indignation), “you have been guilty of mutiny
on the high C's?”
“Znnthus”: The beginning of the Indo-
Austrnlian trade in Walers is outlined in
letters of Captain J. G. Collins, published
in volume 18 of the “Historical Records of
Australia,” just issued by the Common-
wealth. In 1833 Collins came to N. S.
Wales to arrange for annual shipments of
horses for the Madras Artillery. Writing
in 1836 he says that he had already shipped
three cargoes, and had entered into arrange-
ments with the leading breeders to take
horses once a year at a fixed price. Collins
wanted to buy colts one and two years old.
and to ship them at 31 years. He applied
for a special lease of the Kangaroo Valley,
near Moss Vale, as a run for them, but he
does not appear to have obtained it.
T. P. O’Connor, who has sat continuously
for a Liverpool division since 1885, is gen-
erally given the title of “Father of the
House of Commons.” But for a long-dis-
tance record, though not a continuous sit-
ting, the performance of J. T. Agg Gardner,
Conservative M.P. for Cheltenham (Glos.),
is really more impressive. This legislator,
a very obscure one, has contested every elec-
tion for his home burgh—where he is lord
of the manor—since ’6B. He was defeated
at his first attempt, but he secured the seat
in ’74. In ’BO he was put out, but in ’B5
he was returned again and sat till ’O6. Then
he sustained his third reverse, but ’ll saw
him back once more, and since then he has
held on to his job, heading the poll again
last week. His different terms tot up to
nearly 40 years, which puts him a trifle ahead
of “T.P.” in aggregate. He was 22 when
he stood first, and now he is 77.
“Iford” : Time was when the English Lord
Chancellor's pay—£lo,ooo a year during
office, £5OOO a year in pension ever after-
wards —was regarded as something splendid,
even for successful lawyers. But views
change with shrinking money values. Lord
Birkenhead, taunted during the recent elec-
tions with being a £5OOO pensioner on the
taxpayer, snorted at the inadequacy of the
amount. “When I accepted the position of
Lord Chancellor,” he told an audience, “it
was a severe pecuniary sacrifice, for I was
then making £22,000 a year at my profession.
And if I were to return to the courts,” he
concluded, “ask any leader of the Bar if I
wouldn’t be making £40,000 a year to-day.”
And doubtless it is true enough. Before he
accepted a judgeship—or, rather, before he
threw himself into the championship of
Lister —Carson was credited with earning
£30,000 a year.
“Loco”: The locomotives of 1883 referred
to by “Percy Spanner” (B. 20/12/’23) are
not the only “aged” iron horses in use. Here
in Vic. we have some Plicenix Foundry (Bal-
larat) engines built in 1883-84-85, still going
strong. They weigh only 50 tons, and can
haul a load within 20 per cent, of the pon-
derous 85-tou “D»” class, now the standard
Vic. locomotive. It is not so long since there
were English-built engines in use 50 years
old or more. They were not woni out, but
were scrapped because they had become un-
equal to the loads now demanded by railway
practice. I would like to see the records of
repair expenses of one of these old “boats”
set alongside those of a modern outside-
cylinder engine for, sav, the first five years
of their lives. It would rather open the eyes
of the “modernists.” As to relative coal
consumption—well, ask any driver or fire-
man with experience on both.
In S. Aus. the two branches of the law
profession are amalgamated, so the biggest
men at the Bar belong to firms, often with
many partners. Till 1903 just-dead “Johnny”
Gordon was the head of a remarkable one.
In that year he went to the Supreme Court
Bench, and afterwards declined the Chief
Judgeship. His younger brother, James, be-
came police magistrate; Paris Nesbit and
James Anderson (who was the Judge’s son-
in-law, but died young) made K.C.’s;
and Tom Bright, now the only survivor be-
sides Nesbit, is a magistrate.

“His House in Order” is packing the Cri-
terion nightly. It is a long time since Syd-
ney saw anything better in the realm of fine
stagecraft and finished acting than Irene
Vanbrugh and Dion Boucicault.

“A Southern Maid” will throw her last
kisses to enraptured admirers at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, on Friday night. Satur-
day will see the curtain rise on “The Merry
Widow,” with Gladys Moncrieff as Sonia
and Andrew Higginson as Prince Danilo.
* * * 4*
At Sydney Opera House “Rockets” con-
tinues to soar aloft and leave a trail of bril-
liancy behind. Lorna and Toots Pounds
and Charles Austin are firmly established
as public favorites.
** * *
“The Spanish Main” is still washing the
shores of tropic isles, where doubloons are
waiting to be exhumed, at Sydney Royal,
with Oscar Asche as rollicking and resource-
ful a gentleman of fortune as ever sailed
the seas with the jolly Roger at the peak.
It’s a play brimful of riotous incident, but
with little of the downright bloodthirstiness
of the historic ballad which tells how “the
mate was brained with a marlinspike, the
skipper slain with the bos’n’s pike, and
cookie’s throat was marked belike, it had
been gripped by fingers ten, and there
they lay, all good dead men. like break-of-
day in a boozing ken, Yo ho, ho, and a bottle
or rum.” Oscar Asche’s cut-tliroats are quite
genial, likeable souls, not a bit like Billy
Bones or Israel Hands.

Bert Ralton’s Havana Band provides the
star turn at Sydney Tivoli; also, the last
word in mad and mirthful melody. Robb
Wilton, especially in his rhymed monologue,

“ALADDIN,” AT MELBOURNE HER
MAJESTY’S.
Aladdin (Ada Reeve) and her proud mother,
Widow Twankey (Tom Payne).
June Mills is viewed by the gods with pro-
nounced favor. Florence Yaymen adds
piquancy to her character impersonations
by assuming and discarding portions of rai-
ment in a partially darkened boudoir; and
Alec Daimler and Dora Eadie put plenty of
ginger and spice into their lines.
* * *
“Richard, the Lionhearted,” a film built
out of Scott’s “The Talisman,” is worth a
visit to Sydney Lyceum, if only for the faith-
ful presentation of the manners, costumes
and military ironmongery of the period when
men tore across land and sea to biff the
Saracen. Minor attractions are “Don’t
Marry for Money” and the tomfoolery of
Ben Turpin. At the Strand John Gilbert
is seen in the role of flash “Cameo” Kirby,
a Mississippi steamboat card-sharper, one
of whose insolvent victims inconsiderately
blows a hole through himself. “Cameo” is
charged with the crime, and what follows
would make excellent material for a Salv’-
army street-corner repentance. The Globe
harbors Gloria Swanson as “Bluebeard’s
Eighth Wife.” The recollection of the bed-
room scene in the original play is a power-
ful attraction. A cowboy who flees from
the law and enlists aboard a warship is
the motif of “Out of Luck,” at Hoyt’s, where
Connie Talmadge meanders pleasantly
through a maze of humorous happenings.
“If Winter Comes” is hitting the sentimental
spot in the anatomy of Crystal Palace
patrons.
* * * s?
Two or three more weeks of “Sally” will
close a long chapter at Melbourne Royal.
Meanwhile the allegation that every cloud
has a silver lining excites, as before, the
derision of meteorologists who know better.
.** * *
“French Leave” and “A Night at an Inn”
remain in position at Melbourne King’s. It
is, as previously remarked in this paper, the
only house in town where the performance
is free from song and dance, so if all the
people who lately went to the Boucicault-
Vanbrugh plays are bound for the very light
comedy wherein Emelie Polini wears red hail
they will want at least another week to do
it in.
❖❖ ❖ $
At Melbourne Princess’s the pep and purple
of “Little Nellie Kelly,” as soon as the
comedy gets going, arc held to condone the
insipidity of the opening, and the want of
punch among three or four young men who
talk piffle through the telephone. Happily,
the worst of Hugh Ward’s elegant show is
soon over. Last Friday Wesley Pierce
strained something in his back whilst lifting
Hazel Harris, or swinging her round, and
the mishap threatened to keep him out of
business for a few days. Ena Dale, too, has
been out of the bill, but Ena has only a
little to do in “Nellie Kelly,” and her song
introducing the dress parade is nicely
warbled, in a sweet small soprano, by Mary
Gannon.
* * *
At Melbourne Playhouse the bright novices
in Rigo’s Australian Grand Opera Co. are
attracting not so much musical attention as
they are worthy of, though the charm of
“Hansel and Gretel,” played by young
people who look truly youthful, is getting
talked about, together with the fact that
Ivost’s orchestra of 30 is more than adequate.
Roma Phillips, the star Gretel as regards
winsome juvenility of manner, continues to
sing with Nellie Lafferty, whilst Nancy
Horne, who is a better boy, with a keener
enunciation than Nellie, takes the Hansel
part at matinees. At last Saturday’s mat.
the Gretel was Constance Burt, who usually
warbles charmingly as the Sleep Fairy. In
the more exacting part she revealed a hard-
ness in her upper register; nevertheless the
beauty of her best notes suggested that Miss
Burt’s voice, like those of others in the co.,
is worth a lot more training. Vera Bed-
ford took a rest on Saturday afternoon, and
Ruth Cumerford-Phillips (no relation to
Roma aforesaid) doubled the parts of Witch
and Wife, which required her to pop up as
an anxious parent of the children soon after
they had pushed her into her own oven in
the capacity of Witch. If a new bill comes
this Saturday it will be “Barber of Seville.”
9* * *
Cut-throat competition in matinee rates
continues at the Melbourne pantos., with
the result that mother mostly takes the
family after an early luncheon, whilst father
is apt to think panto, one of the things he
can do without. The system of six mati-
nees a week, at alarming reductions in the
price if you don’t go at night, is calculated
to shorten the panto.’s run, anyhow. This
is hardly a matter to be wept over. A Christ-
mas annual that drags out its seasonable
attraction until Easter looks rather like a
white linen suit in winter time. Even Ada
Reeve would be incapable of making Alad-
din seem in strict keeping with the spirit of
late autumn or early spring, though her
tortured romance of the magic lamp is a
festive entertainment at Melbourne Majesty’s
just now. Twice a day on the trying job
is not too much for the only Ada, who appa-
rently has renewed her youth in the panto.’s
old associations. The chorus and ballet sec-
tion improves with practice, of course.
Evolutions and acrobatics that came new
and troublesome to the girls on the first
night are now working like a well-oiled
machine ; and the collapse of the Pekin multi-
tude when Abanazar casts his spell, and
rescues Aladdin from the custody of the
police, has now a spontaneity which is im-
pressive in its purely pantomimic way. Talking
of Pekin police, if the weird constabulary-
services of young Gus Bluett have not been
previously mentioned in this column, the
omission is here atoned for. Gus’s dance
with the Girls of the Old Brigade is sin-
cerely funny.
* if:
“Mother Goose,” at Melbourne Palace,
supplies the same dish of sandwiches as be-
fore, at bargain prices, the refreshment con-
sisting of thin layers of fairy story enfolded
between thickish slices of variety turns.
Consumers who know least about vaudeville
have the most ravenous appetite for “Mother
Goose,” and all citizens of tender years come
within this category.
Red blood and Red men, love, victory and
revenge are all presented in Melbourne
Majestic’s latest thriller, “Pioneer Trails.”
The same screen is the, venue of a lyric love-
story of British manufacture entitled “The
Pipes of Pan,” and showing our old friend,
G. 11. Mulcaster, who appeared in Mel-
bourne in “Bulldog Drummond,” as the dash-
“THE SPANISH MAIN,” AT SYDNEY
ROYAL.
Oscar Asche as Patrick O’ Gorm an, the comic

ing cause of tlie lovelight in the leading
woman’s eyes. Audiences at Hoyt’s get the
chuckles without the juicy personalities of
Potash and Perlmutter in a picturesque
adaptation of the original play. Gladys
Walton, in a circus romance, finds an appro-
priate element in the sawdust that gives a
title to the film. “Cause for Divorce,” at
Hoyt’s Gaiety, is another Broadway noc-
turne, with Fritzi Brunette as the Cause.
“Brass” is on the hill at the Britannia, and
at the Melba Rodolph Valentino is panting
out his passion to a somewhat skinny, bust-
heaving Camille.
* * * :!:
At Adelaide Royal Nellie Bramley has
been flitting from the flippant “Fair and
Warmer” to the saccharine “Daddy Long-
legs,” and from that to the strong “Paid in
Full.” Guy Hastings, who has made a long
stride in his art, plays opposite Nellie, and
the support is good, especially on the male
side. _ At the Majestic, George Storey’s co.
provides a big slice of the show, Dora Lind-
say being a bright spot in the other half.
Under canvas, or starlight—the weather is
changeable—the Sole Circus Christmased
at the old Exhibition Ground, an extra turn
being provided when a performing horse got
annoyed with one of the proprietors and bit
him savagely. The Williamson Co., at the
Exhibition, has put up a pantomime for a
week or so; Arthur Aldridge sings finely
here, and Billy Maloney is funny. Across
North-terrace, at Austral Gardens, Moon and
Morris do much of the work in a similar
show, and Frank Bradley supplies some
clever acting. In pictures, the York switches
from Rudolph Valentino to a cyclone, and
West’s from the clever English film “A Bill
of Divorcement” to Hurley’s strange pictures
of Papua; while Wondergrapli features
Viola Dana and Dorothy Dalton.
“F.A.”: The part of Francesco del Fucgo
in “A Southern Maid” strikes one as being
rather out of proportion—bigger than its
bearing on the plot. Which suggests that
there is something in the story that its
bulk was designed to be worthy of the pro-
ducer, should he deign to step into its props.
He didn’t deign; Asche did so well with
“Chu Chin Chow” that London audiences
were denied the opportunity of seeing him
in musical comedy.
Freda Sternberg writes from London:—
“Fax,” writing (B. 11/10/’23) on the subject of
Rosina Buckman and her early career, says: “Since
then [about 1910] most of the lady’s time has been
devoted to acquiring plumpness that has incapaci-
tated her from heroine characters in opera.” This
is untrue and unfair. Rosina Buckman is one of
the few oversea artists who have really reached the
top of the tree in Britain, both on the grand-opera
stage and on the concert platform. Really it was
about 1908-10 that she began to achieve fame. In
1912 she was engaged by the directors of Covent
Garden, where she sang with Melba in “La Boheme”
and “Louise.” In 1915 with the Beecham Opera Co.
She was the leading dramatic soprano, and did all
the principal Wagnerian roles. Since her return
from her recent Australasian tour she has sung
at Covent Garden and created the leading soprano
rSle in Dr. Ethel Smythe’s “Boatswain’s Mate.” She
has been doing concert work with conspicuous success
in London and the provinces.
“Cockney”: My memories of Emily Sol-
dene go back ever so many years. Before
her engagement at the old Philharmonic (B.
6/12/’23) she sang under her own name at
the Oxford, then and now a first-class music-
hall, and was a great draw. I don’t know
what she got in salary, but she certainly
ranked as one of the brightest “stars” in
London. I saw Emily again as principal
in the opera “Orphde aux Enfers,” to ( niy
mind a much more tuneful thing than “La
Fille de Madame Angot.” Why is it never
produced in Australia?
“Fax”: When William Hughes arrives in
America with his six lectures (presumably
one lecture with five variations) he may find
himself orating on platforms which have been
trodden by Bulletin contributors Tom
Skeyliill and “Storky” Adams. “Storky” is
turning his varied experiences to account as
“M. *P. Greenwood Adams, the Australian
Traveller, Writer and Lecturer.” A circu-
lar thus describes him :
A pioneer of tlie travelogue, a writer and an
amateur athlete, he represents the Nor’-West Scientific
Expedition of Perth, West Australia, and has lectured
on the film record of that party for 180 consecutive
times at the Philharmonic Hall, London. During
the season there he was approached by the National
Geographical Society of Washington, D.C., to lecture
before its members’. He has since appeared at the
Natural History Museum, New York, the University
Museum of Pennsylvania, Brooklyn Institute of Arts
and Sciences, and for many other important insti-
tutions.
It would not be surprising to hear of the
versatile “M.P.A.,” who has been pretty well
everything except a politician, being called
upon to introduce “fellow-countryman”
Hughes to a highbrow audience. Not that
they are fellow-countrymen. Billy is a
Welshman, while Adams is a grandson of Dr.
Jonathan Greenwood, who had charge of the
second batch of immigrants to reach Port
Phillip—they came from Liverpool in 1841.
He represents Australian enterprise, apti-
tude and self-confidence at its best.
“Mancam”: Shakspeare wasn’t always
slipshod in his stage directions (B. 3/l/’24).
What could be more precise than this? —
Trumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two Vergers,
with short silver wands; next them, two Scribes, in
the habit of Doctors; after them, the Archbishop
of Canterbury, alone; after him, the Bishops of
Lincoln, Ely', Rochester, and Saint Asaph ; next them,
at some small distance, follows a Gentleman bearing
the Purse, with the Great Seal, and a cardinal’s hat;
then two Priests, bearing each a silver cross; then
a Gentleman-Usher bare-headed, accompanied with a
Sergeant-at-Arms, bearing a silver mace; then two
Gentlemen, bearing two great silver pillars; after
them, side by side, the two Cardinals; two Noble-
men with the sword and mace. Then enter the
King and Queen, and their Trains. The King
takes place under the cloth of state; the two
Cardinals sit under him as judges. The Queen takes
place at some distance from the King. The Bishops
place themselves on each side the court, in the
manner of a consistory; below them, the Scribes.
The Lords sit next the Bishops. The Crier and
the rest of the Attendants stand in convenient order
about the Stage.
That’s a lot more meticulous than some
modern scripts I’ve worried over.

caddied by Compton Coutts.
From Newlands Brothers, Ltd., Sydney:—
That “immense gilded bed” (B. 3/l/’24)is really
the first gold-mounted double bedstead ever produced
in Australia. The main structure of the design is
of oxidised silver, with a miniature gold map of
Australia, flanked by bronze statuettes of Australian
aborigines, set in a panel on both the head- and
foot-rails. Right across these engraved maps i s
the Southern Cross, its stars being black opals.
Bedstead, mattress and bedding will be part of our
exhibit at the British Empire Exhibition, and we
are quite confident they will draw favorable atten-
tion to the manufacturing skill of Australian work-
men.

The last thousand miles
are the hardest
ALMOST any tyre looks good in the
dealer’s display rack. Almost any
tyre continues to look good the
first few hundred miles of use.
But as the hundreds of miles pile up into
the thousands, and the thousands pile
up too, the truth comes surely forth.
For a tyre, the last few thousand miles
are the hardest.
The last few thousand miles in a Good-
year Tyre are as a rule quite outside the
reach and ability of the ordinary tyre.
They are extra miles—miles given the
user by the extra quality built into
the Goodyear product.
For the largest single group of tyre-
buyers in the world, these extra miles
constitute the final reason for preferring
Goodyear equipment.
They underlie the well-earned reputa-
tion of Goodyear Tyres as the most satis-
factory and economical tyres you can
buy.
In the new Goodyear Cord Tyre with
the bevelled All-Weather Tread this
characteristic of Goodyear performance
is given even larger emphasis.
Every feature, every improvement in
this new tyre is calculated to insure
greater mileage, greater freedom from
trouble, greater economy.
The improved rubber compound in the
tread, the heavier sidewalls, the stouter
ply-unions, the bevelled tread feature —
all contribute to make this the finest tyre
Goodyear ever produced.
In actual service on thousands of motor-
cars it is daily establishing new records
for low-cost performance.
When you buy a new tyre look beyond
the dealer’s display rack to those im-
portant last few thousand miles.
If the tyre you buy is the new Goodyear
Cord with the bevelled All-Weather
Tread, you are assured that those last
few thousand miles will crown a per-
formance in every way satisfactory.

L.T.PIVER.PARIS.
“0.K.”: “S’Blood” (B. 3/l/’24) errs in
supposing that the imported male chorus
for Melba’s Italian Opera Co. may get “lSs.
a week and spaghetti” when they arrive.
They will receive Australian rates of pay.
George Tallis has said so, and Comrade
Huckerby, of the union, will see fair play.
When the Gonsalez Opera Co. came here
with cheap choristers from Italy the inter-
vention of Huckerby resulted in the foreign-
ers being initiated into unionism. Their
wage was multiplied by three, and they fell
upon “dear-r Missa Oockerbee’s” neck. They
even kissed that worthy, to his great embar-
rassment.
Oscar Asche, in conclusion: —
“Thersites” still insists (B. 27/12/’23) that T
stand with my back square to the Duke in Othello’s
address to the Senate. I again give him the lie
direct, and this can be seconded, I think, by any
of the actors who were on the stage during that
scene. I also deny that the Duke has to find his
way alone through a crowd of people. He does
iv thing of the sort. Certain dramatic licenses
are allowed in the production of the play, and 1
consider myself a better judge of what is right and
what is wrong than a correspondent who prefers to
remain anonymous, but of whose identity I am well
aware. “Thersites” should also know that there
are no such stage directions by Shakspeare as
“smothers her” and “unlocks the door.”
Stage directions or not, the words “he
stifles her” and “unlocks the door” are in
The Bulletin’s copy of Shakspeare.
“Hamfat”: An old Thespian friend, now
revisiting Australia, made his lucky strike as
a result of being boycotted. lie helped to
found the original Actors’ Association, which
was bludgeoned out of existence, and his
career as a “juvenile” in drama was prema-
turely closed. Under pressure of circum-
stances, he changed his name, secured a
partner for a vaudeville sketch, and wangled
a contract, representing himself as a recent
arrival from England. The turn went well,
and a S’African engagement followed. Then
a trip to England. This is his second visit
to Australia, and in the intervals he has been
touring various parts of the globe and doing
quite well, thank you.
“Blobs”: “Second Murderer’s” trance-
man (B. 13/12/’23) is an old friend of mine.
The first experience I had of him was in the
Athenaeum Hall. Wellington (M.L.), but
there was no chance to gratify my curiosity
then, as he was railed off from the audience
during the seance, and hauled up to the
ceiling when it was over. But the next
time I mot him he was connected with a
circus, and the procedure was different. He
was lowered about six feet into a grave-like
hole in the ground. A tent-liand had left
a hammer near the edge of the hole, and I
worked it over the side with my boot. It
landed fair on the trance-gent.’s stummick.
lie neither spoke nor opened his eyes; but oh,
the grunt!
“San T.” : Workmen are delving into the
Melbourne Athenaeum Hall preparatory to
converting the ancient Collins-street edifice
into a modern theatre holding 1100. The
plans provide for a gallery, d.-c. and stalls,
with new entrances through one or two of
the small shops that flank the present por-
tico. The enterprise has been encouraged
by the demand for a small independent
theatre in a handy situation, and Frank
Talbot, the moving spirit in the syndicate,
expects to spend £30,000 in preparing the
house for the choicest people. It is to be
ready about the middle of this year, and will
be hailed joyfully as an alternative to the
remote and dingy Playhouse, now the only
place in Melbourne where an outside man-
agement can get a look in.
“Katoomba”: “A Southern Maid” is
rather nice, but that ship’s officer’s rigout
haunts me in my dreams. His coat is ridi-
culously short, and the buttons are in the
wrong places. To be in the swim you should
have eight in the front in a double row and
none on the sleeves. And then that green
tie with red stripes, and a blue shirt! Why
not complete the tootongswabble with red
plush slippers and a bowler hat?
“Norbell”: A late allusion to “Don’t Go
Down the Mine, Daddy,” reminded me of a
singer named Albert, who warbled this affect-
ing ballad at Cremorne Gardens, Perth.
There was a gang of “sports” in front one
night, and when Albert wailed the refrain,
“Don’t Go Down the Mine, Daddy,” a sten-
torian chorus in the R.S. added, “Let the
mine come up to you !” This great improve-
ment was appreciated by all except Albert.
During the interval for drinks—they had ’em
in those days—the singer Hay in wait for
the emendators and smote a sportive lawyer
so hard that his upper lip had to be stitched
at the hospital. When Harry Rickards
heard of the rumpus he recalled the aggrieved
singer to the more decorous atmosphere of
Sydney Tivoli.
“Borom” : An old touring manager of my
acquaintance used to claim an Australian
origin for the expression “getting the bird.”
In the roaring ’fifties, he said, a dead fowl
was the most popular of all missiles for
heaving at actors who had failed to please.
So common was the pleasing custom of “giv-
ing the bird” that the phrase in question
SHE SUFFERED TOO.
“I would hate to he a vocalist! When I
sing it always makes my throat ache.”
“That’s funny! It has exactly the same
effect on my head.”
grew out of it, and eventually became incor-
porated in the argot of the profession. The
corresponding American expression is “get-
ting the hook.” It is said to have arisen from
a vulgar managerial practice of equipping
vaudeville theatres with a long sheplierd’s-
crook, by means of which artists could be
yanked from the stage before worse befell
them.
“Gnarek” : “Flyman’s” par. about visiting
vaudevillains (B. 20,/12/’23) who find on
arriving in Australia that their stuff has
been stolen years before, reminds me. I was
at the Vaudeville Club in London when Sam
Mayo returned from his tour of the Mclntosh
circuit. “Well, Sam, ole boy,” said another
“star,” who was booked for Australia,
“liowja get on dalin under?” “Get on?”
replied Samuel. “When I got there I found
they knoo me best songs an’ gags. All been
pinched by their own comedy blokes. They'd
pinch anything out there. Good job I
didn’t take the wife.”
NOT A SPEAKING LIKENESS.
BROWN: “Hulloa, Jones! Been to the
lecture?”
JONES (on his way home) : “No —jusht
goin’ to it!”
“0.K.”: Will Poluski, dead in Britain,
came to Australia with his brother Sam in
1898, and came back, alone, in 1913. The
Poluski pair of 25 years ago were one of
the best turns that Rickards ever imported.
They were acrobatic dancers who travelled
with sketches, one of them irresistibly droll.
Sam, the dapper brother, played a military
ofiicah inspecting an awkward squad, all of
whom were dummies bar Will. Trouble
arose between Will and the soldier next to
him, and this truculent dummy, being on
wires, used to come violently up against
his antagonist when punched. Finally, the
combatants shook hands, Sam solemnly bless-
ing their reconciliation. Another sketch was
almost as bright, and doubtless the brothers
would have been reimported had there not
been a lot of luggage, as Rickards put it,
to be paid for. Sam was a bachelor, but the
late Will brought a wife and two young
daughters who had to be engaged, the matron
as a serio-chronic and the girleens as duet-
tists and dancers. So the Poluski brothers
came only the once to Australia.
“Orb” : Real wine and ice-cream used in “A
Southern Maid” a novelty? Go to! Didn’t
Vincent Crummies have real washtubs? And
I remember reading of how pleased Dickens
was to find that they had a real goose every
night for Tiny Tim’s Christmas dinner in
a stage adaptation of the “Carol.” Nance
O’Neil advertised the real champagne she
used in “Camille” here in 1900. But I
drank real beer and ate real saveloys on
the stage long before' that. On the night
Newhaven won the Melbourne Cup I was
comeding with Alfred Dampier at Melbourne
Alec. I’d just absorbed a winner’s dinner
at the Cafe Denat, including a bottle of
frisk, cafe noir and liqueurs, and the first
thing I had to do in “Thou Shalt Not Steal”
was to drink two foaming tankards of beer
in full view of the audience. It was the
hardest performance I’ve ever put down, be-
cause props, had provided the real Carlton.
“Hang-Over”: Beatrice Day. who nowa-
days lives on her apple orchard at Mt.
Barker (W.A.), has made a brief return to
the stage in Perth. She took the name-part
in “Niobe,” the artful statue that couldn’t
stand the tickle of an electric wire without
waking up. Beatrice wears well, and, get-
ting good support, made a worth-while affair
of the old comedy.
“Abbot P.”: The renovators at work on
Melb. Athenamm Hall are disturbing hal-
lowed memories. Jennie Claus, one of the
pioneer women violinists, played there in
1873, along with a French pianist named
Rekel. The accompaniments were by Julius
Buddee, some of whose pupils talk of him to
this day. In the mid-’eiglities Marchelli
made the roof ring with her powerful voice.
Tenor Henry Stockwell helped the Italian
soprano. In 1891 came W. 11. Jude, com-
poser and basso, who, like Antoinette Stir-
ling, considered himself inspired from Above.
He it was who wrote “The Mighty Deep,”
once familiar in concert-hall and drawing-
room, but now seldom heard except at
South-street and A.N.A. competitions. Other
Athenaeum entertainers were Elsie Hall, the
pianist; Durward Lely. Gilbert and Sulli-
van tenor; Bernard Walther, Belgian fiddler
(and frost) ; George Paans, erratic, but with
a touch of musical genius; Slapoffski and
his wife; Mel B. Spurr. who restored the
fortunes of his manager, Herbert Flemming;
and the prince of elocutionists, Alexander
W atson.
“Caesar's Ghost” : Our most reliable money-
spinner was “The Plight for Life, a piece
in which the aeroplaning hero arrives in the
heart of Africa just in time to save a re-
spectable bathing belle from a fate at which
I will not even hint. Following the best tra-
dition of melodrama the cast, notably the
soubrette, who had dressed up as a cabin-
boy in order to be near her parson lover,
had transported itself to the darkest district
in the Dark Continent, where there was a
diamond-mine, coveted by the hero, and a
tribe of niggers who spoke “pidgin’ English,
although they had never seen white people
before. The soubrette, pursued across a
front scene whilst the aeroplane stunt was
being prepared, faced the gabbling niggers at
the O.P. entrance and defied them. "If you
lay hands upon me,” she shrieked, "you will
regret it. One white man is equal to 50
black men any day!” This uplifting senti-
ment, ripped out for all it was worth by a
lady who knew her audience, invariably
brought the house down. "You talk about
your Barries and Shaws,” commented an
enthusiast at Wyalkatchem (W.A.). "Did
they ever write a line like that?”
“Second Murderer”: “Poliutu” tells of a
Maori (B. 20/12/’23) who had witnessed
that classic, “The Man They Could Not
Hang,” and killed himself subsequently while
getting up a little show of his own on those
lines. 1 once acquired merit by impersonat-
ing this “Man” for Philip Lytton in a
N.S.W. backblocks hamlet. After the show
I was having a bracer in the Miner’s Rest,
when a gaunt person looked at me sorrow-
fully and murmured, “The man they could
not hang, eh? It seems a pity!’’ And in
my soul I agreed with him.
“M.R.C.”: “Thersites” (B. 20/12/’23) is
wrong in stating that James Hay was a
pupil of Charles Kenningham in W.A. Hay's
Perth tutor was J. B. Huntington ; later he
studied in Melbourne under Marshall Hall
and in Europe under Jean de Reske. Nor is it
correct to say that Hay is not robust * beyond
an attack of typhoid in his boyhood and a
throat operation in Brisbane (that was re-
sponsible for his few absences during the
G. and S. Co.’s long tour) he has enjoyed
good health all his life. Being his sister
I ought to know. As for the statement that
Hay is “the husband of a millionaire’s
widow,” well, even that hasn’t induced him
to leave the stage, for he signed a contract
for 12 months just three days before his
marriage; incidentally, British newspapers
have recorded that he was never in better
voice. Also by the way, I’ve been told the
lady is old enough to be his mother. Actu-
ally, she is no more than 11 days his senior.
“Splinter”: How these actresses are get-
ting on! In pre-publicity days the female
mummer was a comparatively homely body
with no unusual hobby to advertise her to
the world outside. But free, education and
Polytechnic courses have produced a type
tliat can hold its own in literature, the arts
and sciences. So we learn that Ada Reeve
is an expert cook who can produce an
omelette, a sauce, or a souffle that would en-
chant an epicure. She is also so expert
with the needle that even one of her darned
stockings is worth six stanzas. Emelin
Polini, whom I had never suspected of a
literary bent, has lately announced a passion
for the works of H. G. Wells. She talks
learnedly of the impression that Mr. Brit-
ling made upon her, and cold type was un-
equal to presenting the wealth of her regard
for Mr. Polly. I am waiting eagerly for
further revelations of our stage stars’ re-
markable gifts. A sonata for pianola and
piccolo is confidently expected from Josie
Melville, and Mamie Watson will surely
weigh in with an essay on Relativity, at least.
“0.K.” goes to the pantomime:—
Every year the suggestion is made, for the sake
of talking, that panto. Dames ought to be women,
and Principal Boys ought to be young men. I may
have said as much myself, but I never meant it.
The old rule of extravaganza is the right one;
the occasional female who plays mother to Jaelc-the-
Giant-Killer and the infrequent young man who
passes for a fairy prince are exceptions that prove
the rule. No she-Dame I have seen in a panto, was
ever talked about afterwards, nor did the male-boys
who tried to look pretty create a demand for the
experiment to be repeated. When Meynefl and
Gunn staged “Cinderella” at Melb. Royal there was
a man in the Prince part, although the heroine’s step-
mother was not less masculine than Edwin Brett.
One or more pantos, produced by Marlow, if I
remember rightly, had a lively little woman showing
a shapeless pair of stuffed white stockings, and
talking about her late husbands, but her footprints
promptly disappeared from the sands of time. When
female mothers and male sons are ventured in
pantos, there is a loss of striking contrast and a
confusion of ideas. Minor male characters are played
by shapely girls in tights, and these are not in
harmony with a fairy prince who shaves his beard
every afternoon. If they all were true to the
character’s sex the panto, picture would be less
pleasing—and less humorous. The absurdity of the
Dame’s dalliance with the bottle-nosed Baron over
their teacups, or what not, is heightened by the
masquerade of the monstrosity in skirts. Change of
policy in characterisation has been discussed by gene-
rations of pantomime producers, but the decision
of the ages and the sages has remained favorable to
conservative policy.
ALL FOR ART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I am interested in music as an artist: the business
side is no concern of mine.” — Melba.
From time to time some sordid business creature
Exclaims: “Now what about a concert, Dame?
Or an op’ra season, during which we’ll feature
Your matchless artistry and world-wide fame?
Do your duty by Australia!
Do not fear financial failyah!
There is boodle to be gathered up in heaps!”
Then I ask him cursorily:
“What is ‘boodle’? (smiling shyly)
“Is it something that one gives away—or keeps?”
It sometimes happens that 1 hear the hirelings
Who interview my public at the door
(My darling, darling public!) and acquire things
Like notes (on which, of course, I set no store)
Talk about the mammoth profits
I habitually scoff. It’s
Quite a puzzle to me what the creatures mean.
“What are profits?” I ask gently.
“All my thoughts are fixed intently
On that world of Art in which I reign a queen.”
I shan’t forget—not if I live for ages—
My disillusionment the other day.
Some choristers were speaking of their wages
In such a grossly inartistic way
That reprovingly 1 stated
(Though I wasn’t irritated)
“Such opinions show a warped aesthetic sense.
Cease your Philistinish chatter!
Money simply doesn’t matter!
Learn, like me, to view your Art as recompense!”
They answered in a most aggressive manner,
Employing arguments and language crude.
“You draw ten quid,” they said, “for every tanner
“That’s paid to us” I cried “Now don’t be
rude!”
“An’ you take good care you get it;
That we all are game to bet!”.... It
So annoyed me that I shook from heels to head.
“Me take heed of money! Never!”
I exploded. “Why”—... .However,
I had best, perhaps, not mention what I said.

with a Burroughs Book-keeping Ma-
chine is more than 75% automatic.
Each of these automatic features elimi-
nates a certain amount of human labour, saving time and, therefore, money,
Each eliminates one more chance for human error, or an indirect loss through
the time spent in finding and correcting it.
But the Burroughs will do more than just post customers’ ledgers. It will
keep your stock records, write your statements, etc. You will find one of the
many models particularly adapted for all of your book-keeping work,

Calculating
Every business has scratch-pad figuring—
adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing
that you do on odd bits of paper, and when
you have the answer you throw the paper away. To meet this requirement,
Burroughs built the Calculator. It is used for figuring and checking invoices,
estimating costs, figuring discounts, and any job that requires only a quick and
accurate answer. The Calculator is also made in many models and sizes.
It’s light in weight, easy to learn, easy to operate and possesses the well-known
Burroughs quality.

Distribution
There are many jobs in business that
require Group Totals and a Grand Total.
Take for instance, sales by clerks, depart-
ments, lines or branches. The Burroughs Duplex is the machine for this work
because it will list and total the sales of each clerk, department, line or branch,
and give you, automatically, the grand total of all sales. The Burroughs
Duplex is actually two adding machines in one. It, too, is built in many
different sizes and models to fit the varying needs of business.
ď
Consult Burroughs representatives. They will see to it that
you obtain the machine best suited for your requirements.

TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS FOR A CRITICAL ESSAY.
IN order to encourage a more discriminating attitude
towards Australian literature, we offer Twenty-
five Pounds for the best Essay dealing critically with
those Australian works published since Ist January,
1900.
By “critically” we mean an impartial though
sympathetic attempt to judge the qualities and values
of published writings, using with judgment such a
standard as is represented by the words “the best
that is known and thought in the world.”
The Essay should be to the point, restrained in
tone, free from generalities, and be, in itself, a
piece of literature.
The best essay, in our opinion, will be awarded
£25. It will afterwards be published at 2s. 6d. on
our regular royalty agreement, the author retaining
the copyright and receiving a 10 per cent, royalty
on all Australian sales.
The closing date for the receipt of manuscript
will be the 30th April, 1924, and it is hoped that
results will be posted and advertised on the 31st
July, 1924.
In the published volume the publishers may in-
clude selections from other contestants, who, if
their published selections occupy more than two pages
of printed matter, will receive pro rata portion of the
royalty.
All business details in respect of judging and
publishing will be absolutely in our hands, and our
decision will be final in all respects. Sending in
a manuscript will be considered an acceptance of
these conditions.
The author’s name must not appear on the manu-
script, but should be contained in a sealed envelope
carefully attached to the manuscript. A nom-de-
plume should appear on both manuscript and
envelope.
If manuscripts are accompanied by stamps, every
endeavor will be made to return them. It is under-
stood that all authors will retain a duplicate.
Mark all envelopes “Criticism,” and post to

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
A.N.L.: Much obliged. But really that
Yankee Exporter is ignorant of the very rudiments
of economics. For instance, it doesn’t know that
a country which does not import anything at all
may have to export largely in order to pay interest
on foreign debts.... Harold E.: “Beauty’s Psalm”
strikes a fresh note:—
I had a strange dream yesternight
As on my cosy couch I lay;
I saw a woman, pure and white,
Her form was bare and lithe and gay
Pearls gave Purity to her charm,
Upon her lingers diamond rings—
Gems of Innocence like her psalm
Which in soft silken strains she sings.
’Twas verily religious song—
-1 heard soft-whispered solemn notes ;
They told of Love, but not for long —
It is on Beauty that she dotes.
For Beauty is Religion too —
The great goddess of all that’s right;
And ’tis my hope that dream comes true,
Which seemed so real on yesternight.
....M.W. (Greenwich): The verse strains heavily
under its load of commonplace... .Arabe: It doesn’t
move us. . . .Galen: Not well enough compounded. . . .
C.M.C.: The verse needs to be a little better, the
phrasing a little stronger and the theme a little
more oil the print-worn track... .M.M. (Wellington) :
The tennis verse is as solemn as a dirge for a
dead c0w.... Dave C.: Not nearly.... Percy V.: The
verse wants tightening up a lot; also it should be
shortened. .. .Joe T.: They are all far off the track
that leads to print... .Kowsara: As lumpy and
ragged as a moulting camel.... Margot M.: “The
Race” is far too long for its interest... .Z.M.N.:
Try it on the curate when he calls... .R. 0.0.: No
chance till you learn how to write. . . .M.A.M.: None
of them will pull through. .. .W.S.F.: All that
ground has been frequently covered in a more attrac-
tive way.... Margaret O.: Try simpler forms first.
... . Tre.vdee: The fighting parson misses.... Fineran
(or something) : “The Fantasy,” which isn’t a
fantasy, fails chiefly through being dull and badly
written... .R.A.D.: Even topical verse must be a
great deal better than that... .Leander: It’s a strik-
ing idea, but the verse doesn’t carry it, even if
such a yarn could be printed... .Lakey: You can't
rhyme “kid” with “feed” and “harvest” with “hard-
est” without fracturing somebody’s ear.... Maisey:
Not up by several rods or perches... .Talofla: Don’t
try to write any more verse until you get some
idea of what verse should be. .. .T. 8.11.: Nobody
could be amused at that.... Mombak: Let the gentle
villain smite: —
The villain burst into the room,
Armed was he with a hefty broom ;
He gave the heroine wacks one! two! three!
And said he’d found out the hero’s mystery.
Upon her knees she began to plead,
He gave her a wack that made her bleed,
And asked for her jewellery and her purse,
Whereat she fainted and he began to curse.
Hark! ’tis the hoof-beats of a horse;
The rider dismounts, with terrible force,
Rushes the door, hark what an impact, the hinges
Are burst, while on the floor the villain cringes.
The hero confronts him, and seizing his heels,
Swings him around until he squeals;
Till with awful crack his head hits the door,
And slowly his brains drip to the floor.
... .P.D.K.0.: The verse is as wild as the grammar
. ...A.C.W.: The things “The Poet” did were alto-
gether too unoriginal... .Edwin E.: Heavy and wooden
—and old wood at that Marjorie B.: Both miss,
but not by much A. J.S.: Clumsy verse that tries
to say a poor thing. .. .E.P.J.: No, it isn’t a sonnet.
....J.R. (New Farm): “Kelly” doesn’t make a
yarn... .Casley: They flutter too feebly... .Sylvester:
But it doesn’t get to anything. .. . D.D.T.: They don’t
appeal to us... .E.F.S.: The verse is poor; the sketch
hasn’t nearly enough in it. ...Wawoon: Far too
slight A.P.R.: “The River” flows rather dully .. • .
G.8.R.: That complication is a very old one and the
telling doesn’t give it new life. .. .Gerard K.: “The
Chariot of Gold” solemnly bumps along to very
little purpose F.M.E.: “Appreciation” is nearly
good, but the verse won’t carry that clumsy “doth”
at the end. “Clearance” is a good idea, but not
well enough handled. “Absence” is commonplace.
... .Rat: All said often before: but vou have a verse
sense and might score if you would try something
fresh in idea. ... Akran: Rugged verse telling a
thin tale isn’t improved by making the screed a
yard and a half long. .. . W.J.W.: You do a great
deal of rambling to reach no very definite conclu-
sions.... Naphtali, W.C. (Wynnmn), 0.H.C., Lucien
d’Este: Sony, can’t find the space... .C.J.G.R.: On
both sides of the paper—at this time of day!
R.V.P.: That course has been cantered over too
often.... Bogan Gate: Will Ogilvie’s address is still
Hawick, Scotland... .Hiram A.: Well, why shouldn’t
we ? What has his character to do with his art ?
Suppose Shakspeare was a poacher, would you burn
his plays?... .Cania: “Bega” is an echo, albeit a
musical echo Louis L.: “Renewal” is rather
clumsy, and the idea is small... .J.H.: “Illusion”
contains some beautiful phrases; but it all means
so little.... Roadster: Come down off those stilts
and be natural Poet Scamp: Wants a bit more
work —especially at the 6th verse and thereabouts....
T. 5.8.: Merely a noise J.L.H.: None seems to hit
the mark.... J.M.: Don’t doubt they are “actual
happenings”: in fact, they’ve made a hobby of
happening. ... W.A.L.: Don’t strike us; but try some
more.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
T.C.: Flat as the track of a steam-roller... .A.E.:
More duds. .. .A.M.: You’ve given the lady a most
disastrous f00t... .T.D.: Some promise; but a long
way below standard yet. .. .G.W.E.: One succession
of nightmares... .J.N.K.: Misses... .M.L.M.: Be
good, sweet maid, and let who will be —artistic....
W.W.: An ancient trio.... A.S.P.: Not quite....
Alfalfa: Drawing crude; and those niggly little
pen-strokes will get you nowhere... .A.E.M.: You’ve
touched the depths... .J.G.: Nowhere near it.
“G.R.” : “Whitehall” says (B. 27/12/’23)
that the Hampshire, the ship in which
Kitchener went down, lies in shallow water,
and that divers could soon settle the question
whether she was blown up from the inside or
destroyed by mine or torpedo. Actually she
lies in something over 100 fathoms, an impos-
sible depth for a diver. No diving has
hitherto been attempted at a greater depth
than 30 fathoms. In any case her posi-
tion is not known ; there are no surface indi-
cations to give any clue, and, even were the
wreck located, it is impossible that anything
could be. done in so exposed a position.

Skoojibooji” : It isn’t often that the male
party to a fractured romance sues for breach
of promise, but in an Adelaide court the other
day a jilted he-lover came along with an
action for damages—and got them. The evi-
dence showed that the girl had prevailed on
him to go to the expense of building a domes-
tic dovecot, but had changed her mind when
the cage was half finished. The Court said
£5O, apparently to pay for the timber.
“Geo. Rich” : “Mag’s” Queensland publican
can dodge being fined tor supplying half-
castes with grog (B. 13/12/’23) by shifting
to W.A. In Groperland the embargo on
serving full-blooded natives doesn’t extend to
the customer who is only partially abo. The
half-caste may breast the bar and obtain his
favorite stimulant, provided he has the money
to pay for it. And provided also he doesn’t
hail from a camp of all-wool blacks. If he
does that, or even associates with his darker-
skmned relatives to any extent, he slips back
into the abo. classification, and is put on the
prohibited list.

“Sixenate”: Calling upon a friend in the
business I exchanged a few words with a man
in the ante-room, who mentioned that the legal
firm had been the family solicitors for 30 years.
Later on Costs told me ( in grinning con-
fidence, that lie was defending the man for
the eighth time—the present was a house-
breaking charge. The firm had also defended
the client’s brother, his mother, his father and
(before my friend’s time) the grandfather,
not to mention an uncle or so. So you see
the possession of a family solicitor isn’t
necessarily an indication of financial stand-
ing and social h.p.

“Pohutu”: Ilenare’s aversion to the
dentist s chair and the forceps is common
knowledge throughout M.L., yet I know of
only one toothsmith who employs diplomatic
methods to get liis would-be victims into a
state of submission. This genius practises
dentistry-cwm-pharmacy in a South Island
town. One of his own teeth is missing, and
he wears a false one affixed to a small clip
which permits it to be withdrawn at a
moment’s notice. Whenever Ilenare enters
the shop, jaw in hand, the dentist asks him
to wait a moment while he extracts an
acher of his own. With his audience’s in-
terest fully aroused, he then lies back, feels
for the tooth, takes a grip, jerks it from its
place, and is washing his mouth complacently
beto? ' c the visitor realises what has hap-
pened. At this stage the prospective victim,
satisfied that the peg-liauling is as simple
as eating mutton-bird and as painless as a
descending pot of hops, becomes a tractable
five bobs worth.

“0.K.”: When an Australian lolly-manu-
facturer was being fussed over at Ballarat,
his birthplace, the other week, something was
said about a chocolate-machinery scandal
whereof questions had been asked in the
Commonwealth Parliament a year or two
ago. Some scandals die a natural death
and are buried • others defy the undertaker,
me matter of the Customs concession granted
to an outside co. is still alive and crying for
explanation. Chocolate manufacture on a
large scale in Australia, by an Australian,
practically put an end to the import trade
and incited this outside firm to arrange for
manufacture in Australia. But instead of
making its machinery in Australia it was
permitted to import machinery duty-free
though the Australian manufacturer would
certainly have had to pay duty had he im-
ported British machinery. What was the
excuse for granting a special permit to the
outside people to import their machinery
duty-free ? In the name of fair-play to Aus-
tralian enterprise, why this difference’

“Rajah Rakeorf”; The Cremation Society
of Australia, whose office is in Spring-street,
Sydney, has recently issued a prospectus
which makes out a very strong case for the
more hygienic method of corpse disposal
especially on the financial side. To become
a life member costs 10 guineas down, or 12
consecutive annual subscriptions of one
guinea, and this entitles the member to be
cremated at death. But a more convenient
lay-by system is provided: “In cases specially
approved by the council, life membership may
be purchased by payment of £1 10s. on appli-
cation, and the balance spread equally over a
period of three years. As most people^ do
not make provision for payment of their
funeral expenses during lifetime, a means of
so doing is now presented. Should a mem-
ber on these terms predecease full payment of
membership, relations may obtain full bene-
fits upon payment of the balance.” Another
inducement to join is this: “The society
when sufficiently advanced, intends to retain
a special hearse, which will deliver a coffin
to the house and remove the body to the
crematorium. Incidentally the society says
it would regret exceedingly if its prospectus
should reach a home wherein there was a
serious illness. One has heard of undlrtak
mg firms less considerate.
INDENTURES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Nearly every woman will agree that the man
who has knocked about a bit and served his inden-
tures to life makes the best husband.”
When the spirit is ripe for adventures,
And the heart finds a glory in strife,
Youth only is serving indentures
To learn the set business of life;
He gets biffed and bruised
And by Fate is ill-used,
Till he’s made nice and tame for a wife.
The going at times may be splendid
When the lips of kind colleens allure,
And it seems there are pleasures unended
One can easily learn to endure;
But there comes a bump here
And a nasty cut there—
It’s the plain working out of the cure.
When we’ve learnt how girls love to torment us
In the passions we meant as pure fun,
Old Life, by its teaching, has bent us
To take the calm safety of one—
And to tell in our need
Just the lies that succeed
Till the end of the chapter is run.

“Adamascus” : Fate must have some great
chuckles to itself at times. There was re-
cently in the casualty department of Mel-
bourne Hospital two patients. One of them
had slipped into a 2ft. gutter and broken
his leg. The other had fallen from a 30ft.
scaffolding and—sprained his ankle.
F. W. Stephen, Chief Engineer for Rail-
ways in S.A., learned his business under
Higginbotham in Vic., but has been in the
central State since 1876. He succeeded J.
C. B. Moncrieff as Chief Engineer three
years ago, and on his own retirement at the
end of 1923 plans to make a round trip of
the earth.
‘Adamascus”: Sam McGrath, who was
counted Queensland’s aboriginal centenarian,
passed out a few* days ago at Toowoomba.
As far back as 1860 he was a noted black-
tracker, and was associated in that work for
over half a century with his brother Michael,
who died a few months back. Sam went out
very contemplatively—they found him sitting
on a fence.
W. R. Alexander, the new Clerk of Vic.
Assembly, crossed over from the Registrar-
General’s office to the Parliamentary staff in
pre-Federation days. After a gruelling on
Hansard, he was clerk to the Railway Com-
mittee, then mace-herdsman *:nd assistant-
clerk. He is a self-effacing sort of person,
revels in Parliamentary work, and has druuk
deep at the fount of May.
my testim ony to “D.’s” (B.
15/11/ 23) re Major-General Rosenthal’s
front-line qualities. The night before the
Morlancourt stunt I was out in No Man’s
Land and met our then “Brig.” with another
officer bringing in a captured Fritz. It was
a rare place to encounter Generals, let alone
one with a prisoner; but you could never
tell where you would meet “Rosie.”
“Alastor”: Colonel Cameron, Caledonian
Chief and Federal member for Brisbane,
who has just returned from a trip to the
Cold Country, talked about resigning some
time back, and if he does it will be difficult
to get a Liberal to retain his seat —particu-
larly so if, as rumor has it, big Mick
Iverwin, Labor member for Brisbane in the
local Parliament, will contest the Federal
seat. Michael is a vociferous person who
will take a lot of beating.
Another Maori War veteran has gone—
Captain LI. W. Nortlicroft, sometime Sti-
pendiary Magistrate and ex-Chief Justice
and Resident Commissioner of Cook Islands.
In the wild days when Henare was on the
warpath Northcroft was a companion of
Captain Gilbert Mair, who died a few weeks
ago. Several instances of heroism stand to
his credit, including three rescues of com-
rades under fire.
G. ’: Captain Raold Amundsen an-
nounces his second attempt to fly across the
North Pole next May. The distance from
Spitsbergen to Alaska is 2200 miles, and
most of the journey is over an unknown
? re ?* n fi rs t prize of Polar exploration
x? f n ,° intrepid Norwegian was the
A orth-West Passage, which baffled the world’s
navigators for three centuries. Amundsen
slipped through at his first attempt, although
the job took him three years. Later on he
startled the world by getting to the South
loie with extraordinary ease and speed
though the ill-fated Scott was very close
behind him. Last summer he sent Nansen’s
old ship, the Fram, drifting on a vovase
across the North Pole, while lie himself
attempted to fly from Alaska to Spitz-
bergen. The effort failed; the present attempt
is to be made in the reverse direction. Nor-
way has been fired by all Amundsen’s pre-
\ious successes, and he will be a national
hero indeed if he can add the North Pole
to his other successes.
“Whitehall” provides an explanation:—
The sudden rise to fortune, if not fame, of more
or less illiterate Polish, Russian and Levantine Jews
has entrenched me in a theory I held years before the
Great War. The British Jew, who is the aristocrat of
Israel, differs little in his outlook on the world around
him fiom his friends the Christians. He likes money
as the Christian does, and if he has a little
more skill in amassing it, that is merely his luck.
His enthusiasms, national and political, are those of
the men with whom he has been to school, to whose
clubs he belongs, whom he meets at dinner and so on.
In consequence, when a great war comes, he reacts
to it in the same way as a patriot of Anglo-Saxon
stock— not a political patriot, but the sort who goes
to wars. A Monash might have stayed at home and
profiteered: he preferred Gallipoli and Flanders.
What are the enthusiasms that inspire those other
Jew's whom the Diggers saw crouching behind bales of
carpets in the Cairo bazaars, whom Australian tourists
have encountered in every town of the -Egean and
the Adriatic littorals, and w 7 ho are now forging to
the front financially in this country? Certain it is
that these inscrutable creatures are not fired with
thoughts of the splendid achievements of the world’s
Wellingtons, Garibaldis and Napoleons. Instead of
musing on what has been done in wars by heroes, they
brood on what has been made out of wars by trick-
sters and traders. Their legends concern keen young
Hebrews of the past who plunged into great wars
penniless and emerged with millions. Their songs
are not of romantic follies like the Charge of the
Light Brigade, but of some such glorious failure as
Israel da Mendoza, who, in 1640, at the end c-f
Portugal’s 28-year struggle for independence, emerged
wealthier than either Olivares or Luis de Haro (hav-
ing profited impartially from both sides) and lost the
whole of his fortune and both ears on the fact being
discovered.
One war is exactly the same as another in the
essentials —a truism which applies particularly to
war-methods of making money. The chief difference
between the Levantine or Eastern-European Jew and
his co-religionists of England, France, etc. is that
traditions are glowing brightly i n his small brain
which have died to the merest flicker with them.
Years before any money-exchange question arises the
Levantine knows there will be one; that there never
has been a big war without one. He knows what
goods to buy for a rise, or sell for a fall, what
countries are the healthiest for non-combatants, and
the best methods of avoiding military service in
sternly conscript lands. He cherishes a thousand
tales of war-money that was made easily in the
past, each one of which is capable of being applied
to modern conditions. No wonder he wins on the
only field he chooses for battle! The sole means of
checking him in an age when pogroms are going out
of fashion is a school course for Christians and
nationalistic Jews inculcating the classic methods of
exploiting a nation’s difficulties as they have existed
down the ages. It is not likely that its teachings
would be put to practical use in war-time by any
but professional Empire men and hefty young rejects
for active service, but at the worst the innovation
would help to diffuse the profits.

Service
The Royal Regiment of
Scots Dragoons —as such
the “GREYS" were
known in 1704. It was
customary at this period
to present to the Ensign
and his family, as a
token of loyal service,
the standard of the regi-
ment, if unfit for further
use.
I "‘HERE’S nothing mysterious in the popularity ot
-A. "GREYS”—wholesome, well-made, satisfying—their
popularity was inevitable. And it is because of their
unvarying quality that this popularity is maintained. To
those who like a really good cigarette only a "GREYS”
is good enough.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
WE live in moments and decay in
years.
I think the clock the ages under-
stand
Has a white dial and a single hand
That stays for joys and hesitates for fears
And trembles, slowly moving, to all tears,
But sweeps in sighing circles when the sand
Deadens the way across the heavy land
Of dull grey life and straitened heart and
ears.
Breathe on my life, great winds, that I may
know
The stinging rapture when the ages pause
To wonder at the heart’s strong energy !
Let the deep currents swirl me to and fro
That I may catch between truth’s jarring
laws
One moment that is all eternity.
11.
I have walked very far in good green days,
Hearing the kind leaves speaking faithful
things
To some unquiet water, fed from springs
Deep down in the dark places, where no
praise
Of all that merry wind that lightly plays
With the wet cloud one happy moment
brings
To the pent silence. How the river sings,
Eeleased from bondage of the stony ways !
Deep down, deep down, the iron rocks of
doom
Hold the clear spirit that would leap and
flow;
Yet drops seep sunward where the moss is
green.
Oh for the shout of waters “Give me room !
The deep is crying and I needs must go !
Give me great floods, though drought be all
between!”
111.
The fairest roses bloom but once a year.
Oh, tassels of delight to all winds flung
In every season, knots of perfume hung
To make the slow delicious eves more dear !
Strange sweets of God you murmur in my
ear;
Hut these green stems, while yet the days
are young,
Hold black the bloom of all, a song unsung,
A color music exquisitely clear.
In the great garden of ten thousand songs
The music of warm life arising sways
In long intoxicating melody.
The sunlit green with heavy blossom
throngs;
But oh for one great bloom of all the
days—
One rose—the rose magnificent for me!

DAVID MEKER WRIGHT.
The Quality of Hate.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CARROL believed in hate not as an
abstract emotion, but as a concrete,
definite force. He believed it to be
the primary, elemental agency, the vitalising
Power behind the whole of existence. To
mm it seemed perfectly reasonable to ask
how so terrific an emotion should apparently
be impotent unless directed through some
material medium, such as a gun or a knife.
And the conclusion he arrived at was that the
accepted theory was entirely wrong. What
Was right he didn’t exactly know, except that
what men called the emotions were so much
force running to waste, because not under-
aerstood. They were as much a physical
Property as the brain through which
they were usually discharged. They were
Part and parcel of the man himself, yet
separate entities capable of unsuspected and
terrible detachment.
He was particularly conscious of his
strange theory now. Since early morning
ms head had ached and throbbed with the
ttort to focus a thought which persistently
eluded him.
He had been passing along a street of the
üburb in which he lived, when he came face
, ° * ace with a man about his own age, with
a stubble of grey beard and rather promi-
nent eyes. They stared at each other a
matter of seconds, then passed on.
Literally that was all. Yet Carrol had
queer feeling that not only were they
town to each other, but that in some sinister
ay the mind of each had fumbled and
rve S i‘ H was bke a kind of visual echo
r the past. And Carrol wasn’t at all
mixious to remember the past.
Carrol was not so much troubled at his
wn failure to remember as by the thought
.mat he had himself been recognised. It
fid seemed to him that there was some-
Puig like menace in the eyes of the other.
*■ was it the imagination born of distrust?
Ills wife and daughter were entertaining
mat evening, and he was glad when he could
mcently withdraw to his library, and lie on
Pe couch by the open window, and smoke
t ] lmk and stare at tlle wall of night
•, His sense of hostsliip was not very
p f>bly developed. But he liked his women
to entertain. Carrol thought a good

ened their comfortable security was likely

Pctics.

* orfume of the magnolias at the foot of the
Sh j n ' He could see them massed in thick
madow against the arc of sky, and overhead
cluster of stars pricked on the velvet
f P-oud of the night. He watched them
t ,om under lialf-closed lids, marvelling at
jieir clear-cut brilliance. They reminded
™ of particles of blue ice on a sea of ink.
th y i now tlie bouse was silent, except for
liw clock 011 his desk - The bands were
C'animus, and Carrol saw that it was close
j. midnight. But he felt no inclination to
",e finished his cigar and threw the
StH? out °f. tk e window, where it left a faint
near of light against the smoothly silliou-
Prni- la wn. He watched it fade into
straining his eyes to a delicious
\OWsniess. He must have dozed then, for
mm next he roused it was nearly three.
He had barely assured himself of this when
ihi'ead of sound reached him from the din-
mg-room. He sat up, with throbbing head,
and . listened. Someone or something was
moving. His hand went instinctively to the
light switch, but was withdrawn. Better, he
decided, to let events shape themselves. He
reached out the automatic from a drawer ©f
his desk, and settled himself to wait. Sooner
or later the intruder would discover the divid-
ing door and enter the library. Carrol hoped
grimly that he would not be overlong about
it. He was feeling the need for some sort of
action. The furious hatred at the back of
his mind amounted to a sort of congestion. It
was the more unbearable because it pointed
nowhere and at no one. It lacked focus.
A little silence ensued, wherein Carrol
sought to picture the other’s movements,
though the effort was accompanied by a cer-
tain distaste. It was extraordinary how the
crevices of the mind retained the detail of
events made misty by time, while denying the
events themselves. It was like recalling the
features of a forgotten face.
He came to himself again alertly at a noise
of fumbling. He sensed, rather than dis-
cerned, the slow inward movement of the door.
There came a second pause, while Carrol
held his breath. Then a tiny pencil of light
stabbed the darkness for part of a second,
and was gone. It seemed to Carrol that in
that fraction of time the ray touched every
object in the room, miraculously missing
himself. And at that he pushed the clip,
and the place was flooded with light.
The consternation of the intruder was
ridiculous. For several Seconds he re-
mained as if paralysed, his head thrust for-
ward, his mouth agape.
The humor of it, however, was lost to
Carrol. He saw before him the man he had
met in the street, and the unexpectedness
of it made his jaw sag. But the surprise
passed quickly, leaving relief in its stead.
A common housebreaker. Nothing, after all,
of more consequence than an ordinary crook.
The discovery almost restored his good
humor, so that he began to banter over the
sights of the automatic, for the moment
oblivious to the swelling tumult at his
temples.
“vVell? Got a decent haul, would you
say V”
The man moistened his lips. His eyes re-
vealed a tentative impudence.
“None so bad —if some people would mind
their own business.”
“Strikes you that w 7 ay, does it?” grinned
Carrol. But now he was again conscious
of something vaguely disquieting, and his
voice halted abruptly. “No, don’t trouble
to move. Put your hands straight out be-
fore you—so.”
The other obeyed. “What are you going to
do about it?” he demanded.
“Why, there are places where they under-
take to care for your sort of enterprising
gentlemen, I’m told. I’d hate to go against
precedent.”
“Funny as Hell, ain’t you?”
He was an oddly indeterminate figure,
facing Carrol with eyes that wudened ever
so slightly. Suddenly his voice rose.
“That’s strange,” he said. “Haven’t I
seen you before?”
“This morning,” said Carrol, but yielded
to a sense of caution. “Why, that’s likely
enough,” he sneered. “I take a seat on the
Bench now and then. What was it last
time? Was it housebreaking then, too?”
The thrust went unheeded. Disregarding
the automatic, the other pointed a shaking
finger at Carrol.
“I thought I knew you,” he said. “You’re
Jimmy Carey, the cove that cracked Selen-
myer’s safe deposit in nineteen-five and got
away with it. I ought to know. I helped
you do it.”
“You’re a liar,” said Carrol, wondering at
the quiet, far-away sound of his own voiee.
“My name is Carrol. And, among other
things, I’m a district magistrate. If you
think this-sort of thing will help you, you
can save your breath. I see it’s a case for
the police, after all.”
“If you bring those swine into it,” the
intruder told him tersely, “I’ll raise hell on
you.” He shook his head. “It’s no good,
Jimmy. After all these years, eh? But I
reckon my memory stays.' And they’ll have
your finger-prints up at the C. 1.8., any-
how.”
If Carrol heard, he gave no sign. The
thought that corded his veins, and wet his
hair with an icy sweat, was the understanding
that here, at last, was the meaning of his
soul’s torment. The hate in him drew to-
gether like the limbs of a jungle beast bunch-
ing to the spring. With an immense effort
he caught and held the trailing leash of his
sanity.
“I seem to be entertaining an unusually
imaginative burglar. But I hope I caii
always find the time to be amused. So I’m
Jimmy Carey, am I? And I—what was
it I did?” The hand holding the automatic
trembled ever so slightly. “Bah ! What do
you think I am? Don’t move, I say. A
dead body is an unpleasant thing to have in
the house, though I have no doubt I could
explain yours easily enough.”
The other gave a twisted grin.
“It won’t do, Jimmy; it won’t do. You
may be all sorts of a big bug”—-his promi-
nent eyes took stock of the handsome room
admiringly—“but you’ve your limit, the
same as the rest of us. Cut out the guff.
The man that could put it over Pinky Short
isn’t born. You ought to know it.' What
I say is, put the cards on the table.”
“Pinky,” said Carrol, suddenly giving over
all pretence—“Pinky, it may be as you say.
But you want to get it into your head that
this Jimmy Carey you speak of is dead. So
far as crook work is concerned he died the
night Selenmyer’s crib was cracked, which
was also the night Jimmy Carrol was born.
You can call it a coincidence, if you like. I
guess Carey never stole because he liked it.
He did what he did because there wasn’t any
other way that he could see. Every man has
the right to one start in life, and Carey
staked his freedom against the jewels that
gave him his. He’s gone straight ever since,
and he’ll keep on that way, so long as he’s
let. And if you. know 7 him as well as you
say you do, you will know he isn’t a man
that it will pay to interfere with. He’ll
fight, Pinky.”
“I thought you couldn’t keep it up,” said
Pinky. He gave way to silent laughter,
helping himself to one of Carrol’s cigars.
“Oh, I ain’t afraid. It wouldn’t pay you
to shoot. Ain’t it queer how things happen?

Is Every Day a
Backache Day?
Are you dragging along day after day, with a dull,
nagging backache? Does morning find you tired, lame
and stiff? And when evening comes are you all worn
out —barely able to finish the day’s duties and drag
yourself to bed? Truly, life can hold few pleasures when
you feel so miserable. But don’t be discouraged! Just
realise that a cold, a chill or a strain has likely weakened
your kidneys and brought on that all-day backache;
those sudden stabbing pains; the headaches, dizziness and bladder difficulties. But, fortunately,
kidney disorders are usually easily corrected, if treated promptly. So don’t worry! Simply take
things easier for awhile get plenty of rest and sleep, and help your weakened kidneys with Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. Doan s have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your neighbor!
CONVINCING SYDNEY TESTIMONY.
Mrs. S. T. Burrows, 19 Springside Street, Rozelle, Sydney, says:
In common with many others I have nothing but good to sav for
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. Some few years ago I was suffering

across the small of my back and dizzy feelings, besides havin'* no
energy for anything One day my attention was called to Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills, and, in the hope that they might benefit me T

Mr. Jos. Goddard, 6 Windsor Street, Paddington, Sydney, says:
“For some time my health was far from good, due to the fact that
my kidneys were very disordered. I knew this to be the case, as I had
aching pains in my back, was always tired and languid, and could not
get proper rest at night. When I first began to feel off color ’I did
not bother about it, thinking I would soon be all right again, but
this is where I made the mistake. I got worse instead of better, and
by the time Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me
I was suffering a good deal. A friend advised me, to try these pills,
so I got some, and, after taking them for a few days my health began
to improve, and by the time I had used five bottles I was cured. I
feel grand now, thanks to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Six years later Mr. Goddard says: “I am still well, and have had
no return of my old complaint since Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me over six years ago.”

Fancy me running the rule over Jimmy
Carey’s own house. And yet I’ve always
counted myself unlucky.”.
Carrol regarded him with compressed lips.
“You’ve some joint here, by the look of
it,” Pinky conceded presently. He blew a
great cloud of smoke out of his flattened nos-
trils. “It ought to pay a dividend, if it’s
handled right. You ain’t the only man that’s
got tired dodging the cells, and I’m at an age
when work begins to pall. Ilow’d you like
me for a neighbor, Jimmy? Bet’s get down
to business. What’s it worth to me
to add Carey and Carrol together, and make
the answer Carrol? It’s your turn to speak.”
Carrol had no consciousness that he was
replying. He seemed in some way to be
listening to a voice that caine from him, but
was not of him. There was a dead level of
expression that reminded him of the flat
monotone of an approaching projectile.
“Blackmail, eh, Pinky? And for how
long would you hold your tongue? I’ll tell
you. For just so long as you could make
my money last you. D’you think I don’t
know ?”
“I remember you always had a gift for
setting things out as they’d ought to be,”
said Pinky insolently. He no longer cared
to mask his malicious triumph. “Well, may-
be there’s an easier way and a safer —for
you. They tell me Carrol has a daughter
lie sets some store by. A handsome enough
filly, I’ll take my oath. Marrying ain’t in
my line, but I’d do more than that to oblige
a friend.”
“Take care!”
Pinky spat the cigar to the floor with
vicious emphasis.
“All right, Jimmy, all right. If you want
it your way you can have it. I’ll have five
hundred down. And when that’s gone an-
other of the same. I’m going to squeeze you
till you sweat pure blood. Come across,
Jimmy, or I’ll get this Carrol man 15
years’ hard.... Damn you, I believe you’d
shoot if you had the guts.”
“Now,” said Carrol —or the Thing that
was in him.
He saw the point of the automatic writhe
upwards, as a snake writhes, felt his drums
flatten themselves to’ the roaring fury of the
discharge. Pinky’s face, with its protruding
eyes and flattened nostrils, its gaping mouth
and expression of stupid surprise, seemed to
come close against his own, then recede into
an oncoming wave of blackness. Carrol put
out his hand and felt the leather of the
couch rising to meet the sag of his body.
For a long minute he lay perfectly still,
his eyes closed fast against an eddying sick-
ness. The automatic had slipped from his
grasp—at least, his palm no longer knew
the quick touch of it. Presently he stirred,
and was amazed to discover the darkness con-
tinued, save for a pale effulgence from the
window. He peered at it dizzily, wondering
what had caused the electric light to fail,
and how the presence of a moon had before
escaped him. And then he saw that it was
not moonilght, but the slow breaking of
dawn.
Carrol supposed he must have fainted, else
how could he have lain so long? It was
extraordinary that the sound of the explod-
ing gun had failed to arouse the household.
The place was in absolute quiet. He strained
his eyes, seeking a glimpse of the body he
knew to be huddled on the floor at his feet,
but met no answering shadow. With that
he felt for the lighting switch and the room
leapt to brightness.
For a moment Carrol doubted his senses.
The place was exactly as he remembered it
on entering to take his perplexities to the
couch by the window. There was no sign of
an occupant other than himself. Everything
was in perfect order. It was amazing, in-
credible.
Suddenly he remembered the automatic,
and sought for it vainly on all sides of the
couch. Something prompted him to look in
the drawer of his desk, and there he found
it. The magazine was empty. He remem-
bered then that it had not been loaded for
at least a year.
“Good God!’’ he breathed, and flung the
thing from him and went back to the couch
and sat down with his head in his hands. It
was absolutely unbelievable that he should
have dreamed the whole thing. Yet if not
that —then wliat? Was this madness?
Day was flooding the sky above the mag-
nolias, and a freshening dawn-wind stroked
the nape of his neck. He rose again pre-
sently and turned off the lights. Mechani-
cally he noted the time. It was within a few
minutes of 6 o’clock.
It was then Carrol became aware of a
curious fact. The extraordinary thing about
his brain and body was their quality of
emptiness. He seemed to have lost an integ-
ral part of his personality and vitality both.
He felt, he imagined, as a gun might feel on
a sudden violent expulsion of the charge in
it. The intimacy of the exhaustion w’as
complete.
But the really significant thing about this
indefinite state of mind and body was its
recusancy. He no longer hated, nor did he
know the slightest symptom of fear. If the
man he had passed on the street was indeed
Pinky Short—surely the one man above all
others from whom he must preserve his
identity—he felt he could face him now with
complete equanimity. His hatred, like an
actual missile, seemed to have expended it-
self in that one supreme thought-image—
vision—hypnosis—whatever it was.
Carrol went presently and laved his
feverish skin with water. Then he put on
his dressing-gown, and opening the front
door went out into the cool of the morning.
As he stood sucking the freshness of it into
his tired lungs, he heard footsteps coming
along the gravel path. A moment later
there came into view the shining helmet of a
policeman.
At sight of Carrol the man seemed relieved.
“I was coming to knock you up, Mr. Car-
rol,” he explained soberly. “I want to tele-
phone to the station, and yours is the handi-
est.” He looked back over his shoulder. “A
moment ago I came on a chap lying half
in and half out of your gate. Dead as a
herring, but not. a mark on him that I can
see. Heart failure, I guess.”
“You know where the ’phone is, Slade,”
said Carrol, a little aghast at the tragedy.
It seemed in some way to reprove the nega-
tive climax of his dream. “Just go in, will
you.”
He went on down the path, incurious but
not indifferent. Poor beggar! It must be
rather awful to go out all of a sudden, like
that, without a moment’s warning.
He came presently to the body, sprawled
grotesquely with its back to the stone coping
of the gate. As Carrol halted with a sharp
exclamation, the. dead eyes, yielding to a
trick of sunlight, appeared for a single in-
stant to look straight into his own.
He stood numb, staring down through a
gathering haze.
He saw a man about his own age, with a
stubble of grey beard and rather prominent
eyes.
BERNARD CRONIN.
The Re-birth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
woman tramping the block in the
dazzling rain smiled bitterly at the
reflection that the cant phrase for an
existence such as hers was “the gay life.”
That afternoon, penniless and almost de-
spairing, she had come into town early and
repaired to the wineshop she usually
haunted. It was strangely deserted. The
men who did drift in averted their heads
when she smiled. And her purse was empty.
Now, out in the rain, the few males who
passed were just as coy. The cold that was
biting into her bones made her shiver as
she watched the cold reflections of the lights
in the sloppy streets. Better to be home—-
but home was no more than a cold, dreary
room. She shivered again at the thought of
it. She recalled nights when, wild with ex-
citement and liquor, she had cried “This is
the life!” but the memory only intensified
her anguish.
A passing man lingered, and gave her
hope. It had hardly existed when she first
greeted him, for he was old, and there was
an air of austerity about his grey beard and
stern face. She turned swiftly, desperately,
to him, and he came to meet her.
“May!” he exclaimed. “You’re May?”
“Yes, dearie; of course, I’m May.” His
vehemence startled her.
“May!—the young wife I married in my
middle age and drove out of my house ! Six-
teen years ago ! May, I have been looking
for you! I should have tried to save you,
instead of condemning you to this. If you
will come back, there is a home for you. I
will make amends.”
“You will take me home?”
“If you will come.”
Hysterically she clung to his arm. “Home?
Home?” she cried. “My God! Of course
I’ll come.”
* * * *
The old man was not a lovable character.
He was harsh and often mean ; but he re-
served for her a softness of manner which
she soon understood was part of his atone-
ment. After the departure of his young wife
he had pondered much upon what he had
done. And it had not taken him long to
decide that he was at fault.
She showed her gratitude in all her
actions. She waited upon him hand and
foot. She skilfully anticipated his needs.
And he studied her and wondered.
“You don't seem like the old May,” he
would sometimes say. “Suffering has changed
you, my girl. The old May was selfish,
thoughtful only of herself. Y0u....”
There seemed to be suspicion at the back
of his mind. She thought once or twice of
allaying it by some act of studied casualness,
but always a soft gratitude welled up again
as the opportunity to serve him came.
One night he shivered as he slept. She
slipped out of bed and filled a hot-water
bottle. As she placed it beneath his feet
he started and sat up.
“You are not May!” he said with convic-
tion.
She fell back, confusion on her fgce.
“Tell me the truth, sirl —you are not
May?”
“I am May.”
“But not the wife I drove away,” he said.
“Tell me—tell me!”
“If I was not, would you send me away ?”
“Ah, you admit it! I have long suspected
it! You have been too kind, too good, for
the May I know. You do admit it?”
“Why should I not. be kind and good—
if you say I am! —when I think of what
you have given me? But I am May—your
wife.”
“Why lie to me? It is not necessary.”
“Would you send me away?”
He looked at her, and his harsh face be-
came gentle.
“No. When I brought you to my home
it was because I felt it was a duty I owed
to one I had wronged. But your kindness,
your sweetness, has made me love you. If
you will stay I would have you stay. No,
more than that—l can’t let you go! But we
must be married.”
* * * *
The old man lay dying; and his wife
hovered near him, sad but resigned.
“May!” he called softly.
She came to him.
“You have been very good to me, dear.
Your patience has been wonderful. I have
always been thankful that I met you; and
yet that meeting leaves me one regret now.
I still think in my latest hour that I may
have done the other May—selfish, unkindly
as she may have been—a wrong, for which
I should have made amends.”
“Don’t think of her, John.”
“I can’t help it, dear.”
“She is not worth remembering. And she
is dead.”
“Dead?” he questioned, faintly.
“Yes—the unkindly, selfish May is dead.
The one who used to leave you on the old
green garden seat for Joe Finch”
He turned to her, painfully, startled.
“You know?”
“John, I saw you were suspicious, but
when I realised that you would love and
keep me for myself as I am, I decided to let
the old May die. But I really am the May
you married years ago.”
“I am glad,” he sighed, and sank back.
His eyes closed and she leant over to kiss
him.
