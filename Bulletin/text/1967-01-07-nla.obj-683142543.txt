JANUARY 7, 1967
Killing Ronald Ryan
AFTER the 15 gentlemen in the
Victorian Cabinet decreed on
Monday, December 12, 1966, that
Mr. Ronald Joseph Ryan should
be killed, his execution was placed
in the hands of an official called
the “Director General of Social
Welfare.” This gentleman was
quoted on the day of the Cabinet
announcement as saying that Mr.
Ryan would be hanged from a
gallows over a corridor in D Block
of Pentridge Jail. What he did not
say was that between that time and
the date of the execution there
will be feverish activity in prepara-
tion for the obscene operation. A
hangman will have to be recruited
and surreptitiously slipped into the
jail, where he will practise with
dummy sacks. Prisoners will dig
a grave, an especially long one, to
accommodate the stretched corpse
of Mr. Ryan, and warders will
do their best to keep the con-
demned man in the best of health
and his last days as pleasant as
possible. He will have all the beer,
TV, cigarettes, and good food he
asks for. Meanwhile, he endures the
torture of the knowledge that, sub-
ject to his legal appeals, at eight
o’clock on January 9, bound,
struggling, and filthy with fear, he
will be -dropped to dangle by the
neck and die. Whether he actually
dies through strangulation, the
rupture of the nervous system in
the spinal cords, or through
internal haemorrhage is not
predictable. Nor is the speed with
which death will ensue, although
15 minutes is mentioned by one
authority as a rough average.
While he waits we, too, may ask
what good reasons can be
advanced to support his execution
or any execution. The last proposed
hanging in Victoria was of Mr.
Robert Tait, a man convicted of
an extraordinarily grisly, perverted,
and callous murder of a helpless
old woman. Ryan’s crime could
hardly be more different in
character the fatal shooting of
a prison warder in the wild flurry
of a jail-break 13 months ago. The
fact that the victim was a warder
is the only remarkably thing about
the case, and this may be a reason
for invoking the death sentence:
the desire to do “the right thing”
by prison officers and the police.
Supporters of the Government in
this matter, though not the
Government itself, have said as
much, and rumors, though un-
substantiated by the union leaders
involved, have been floated to the
effect that warders and police are
not only eager that Ryan should
hang but are prepared to resort to
strike action if his life is spared.
Evidence
THE belief that the threat of the
death penalty may protect those
who deal with criminals is under-
standable, but it is not supported
by the facts. Every factual survey
fails to find that law-enforcement
officers are safer where there is
the punishment of death. If any-
thing, the evidence suggests they
are safer without. H. A. Bedau’s
compendious volume “The Death
Penalty in America” prints several
studies of the question, including
Thorsten Sellin’s 1964 survey of
the experience of police depart-
ments in 265 American cities in
the previous 35 years. In 128 in-
cidents, 138 police had been killed.
Most occurred when the police
were investigating robberies or
arresting suspects, and they
occurred slightly less frequently in
abolitionist States than in the
retentionist ones. In Britain the
Royal Commission of 1953 also
said it was unimpressed by police
and prison officials claiming
capital punishment had some
uniquely deterrent value in protect-
ing them. Most killings of police
and warders occur in unexpected
clashes, when the penalty is quite
out of mind.
Another argument was raised
by Gordon Hawkins in THE
BULLETIN (November 7, 1964),
when he claimed that aboli-
tion leaves us without any sanction
against lifers who murder again in
prison. This neglects the fact that
this crime is extraordinarily rare:
there are no examples recorded in
Australia and very few even in the
rich criminal history of the U.S.
In any case, there simply are
sanctions which can be employed
withdrawal of parole rights,
closer confinement, greater super-
vision, hard labor, denial of
pleasurable facilities normally
available. There is also flogging.
As for the alleged deterrent effect
of hanging on potential mur-
derers in general, a great range of
surveys have been made of the
relation between homicide rates
and the application of the death
penalty. Bedau’s book documents
several. Thorsten Sellin finds that
the death sentence “exercises no
influence on the extent or fluctu-
ating rates of capital crimes”;
so does L. D. Savitz, writing after
investigating four executions in
Philadelphia. W. F. Graves,
analysing the situation in Cali-
fornia, concludes that executions
and the publicity surrounding them
tend to advance murders by several
days but leave overall rates un-
changed.
The facts —> as opposed to
abstract, supposedly tough-minded
theorising all show that the
death penalty is not a better
deterrent of murder than imprison-
ment. Most murders are not
calculated acts by otherwise
normal people. They are generally
committed by people who are
crazy or momentarily crazed. A

normal person in a normal and
calculating state of mind is rarely
going to murder. In the rare cases
in which he does he will feel sure
in his own mind that he can get
away without being caught. In all
these cases the penalty is irrelevant.
This raises the political question.
The death penalty has become
patently a matter for the whim of
Cabinet. It is hardly coincidental
that the initial announcement that
Robert Tait would be hanged was
made immediately after a by-
election, and that although the
High Court had rejected Ronald
Ryan’s appeal in October, the
Victorian Cabinet waited two
months for the political position to
clear before making their decision
in December. In particular, they
waited until a Country Party rebel
in the Legislative Council, Mr.
Feltham, had come into line by
allowing passage of a Government
bill to raise stamp duties. Had he
held out against it, an election
would have had to be held immedi-
ately in the new year and the
Cabinet did not want to order a
hanging until it knew it was safe
from this. It would be a nasty
distraction, and the public furore
would make it difficult for it to
denounce the Labor Party as
archaic.
Mr. Ryan will die, if he dies, not
as a result of some inexorable legal
process, but because of the whims
of politicians. The Cabinet has
complete jurisdiction once the
courts have convicted. Seven of the
fifteen members of Cabinet have
privately dissociated themselves,
from the hanging decision: Chief
Secretary Rylah and Ministers
Thompson, Bloomfield, Rossiter,
Porter, Hamer, and Manson. The
only men ardently in favor of
hanging are Premier Sir Henry
Bolte and a junior Minister, Mr.
Wilcox, but, with the passive sup-
port of six others and in the
absence of any vigorous anti-
hanger, they are understood to
have won the hanging without
even a vote being taken.
Smokeless Carbine
IF and when the life of Ronald
Ryan finally passes away, and
whatever the courts have said or
will say, there will still be public
doubts about whether he fired the
shot which killed warder Hodson.
Four eyewitnesses said he did,
although two- of those spoke of
having seen a puff of smoke from
his carbine as he fired and his car-
bine was smokeless in operation. A
dozen witnesses said they heard one
shot fired, and another warder
from within the jail admitted to
having fired one shot from the
prison parapet in the direction of
the action outside. No one heard
another shot. So there are grounds
for doubt. Ryan’s counsel, Mr. P.
Opas, QC (a retentionist), is
quite convinced that Ryan’s con-
viction was mistaken, and that
Hodson died from his fellow
warder’s inaccuracy. Mr. Opas
may be wrong, but a terrible
responsibility rests on the con-
science of the Cabinet.
It is bad enough that they
should sanction an obscene and
futile act of vengeance, but
infinitely worse if it should be in-
flicted on an innocent man.
We have our young men fighting
and dying in Vietnam to help
prevent a regime coming to power
which, in the ultimate analysis, is
objectionable because of its
systematic and widespread use of
the violence and terror embodied
in the hanging of an innocent man.
Here in Melbourne we risk a
horrible betrayal of this national
cause.

The Catholic Underground
Should Bishops he Elected?
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
THOU art Peter the Rock, and on
this Rock I shall build my
Church, and the gates of Hell
shall not prevail against it, and I shall
be with you all days even to the con-
summation of the world.”
These Gospel words of Christ are
an important part of the theology of
the Roman Catholic Church in the
matter of the Establishment of
Bishops, their rights and duties. They
are generally taken as being the formal
sign of the institution of the first
Bishop.
Even in these liberal days when X
equals God there is no dispute amongst
Catholics about the Divine appoint-
ment of and the Apostolic necessity for
Bishops, but now the subject of more
debate than at any time since the
Reformation is the question of the
tion of Bishops.
Amongst the more independent-
minded Catholic clergy this is one of
a number of issues on which there is
a strong underground movement of
protest and reform. Although not often
discussed in the open, some of the
other burning issues which seem to be
emerging are:
• The celibacy of the clergy (a recent
report by the famous Jesuit sociologist
Father Joseph Fichter is that 62 per-
cent of priests in the United States
believe that diocesan priests should be
free to choose between marriage and
celibacy).
• The origins and powers of the seven
Sacraments (Baptism, Confirmation, the
Eucharist, Confession, Holy Orders,
Matrimony, Extreme Unction).
• The meaning of the Mass.
• The existence of Hell, Purgatory,
and Limbo.
• The status of the Virgin Mary.
JN the case of the election of Bis-
hops, some of the major complaints
about the present method of appoint-
ment from above are that it encourages
clerical “yes men” to trail behind the
frocks of the existing Bishops, that
bureaucrats stand a better chance of
promotion than pastors, and that men
of vision and spiritual initiative tend to
be less favored than pious conformists.
One has only to listen to the nick-
names used by some of the more lively
younger Australian Catholic priests to
describe some of their episcopal
superiors to come to the understand-
ing that many Lord Bishops are not
held in high regard, at least in human
terms. Among laymen the language
can sometimes be even more violent:
one Catholic intellectual is well known
* for his insistence that his former
Bishop was a “clerical gangster.”
The last Bishop to be elected by a
vote of priests of the diocese was Dr.
Justin Simonds, now Archbishop of
Melbourne, and formerly Archbishop
of Hobart. Dr. Simonds moved from a
New South Wales seminary to ad-
minister his Tasmanian See in 1937,
a few months before the Fourth
Plenary Council of the Catholic
Church in Australia. The Council gave
him the opportunity to make his oft-
repeated quip that he is the “last
democratic Bishop in Australia.”
Decree No. 84 of the 1937 Plenary
Council reads:
“In proposing to the Apostolic See
priests who are suitable and worthy
for the episcopal ministry, the Bishops
should, for the future, and until the
Holy See should provide otherwise,
observe the procedure' laid down in
the following articles:
1. Every two years, in each province,
at the time and place determined By
the Archbishop (of that province),
the Bishops shall assemble to select
those who are to be proposed to the
Holy See for the episcopal ministry.
2. Before they so meet, the Bishops
will ask their diocesan consultors and
some, at least, of the irremovable parish
priests, each one separately, and under
a grave obligation of secrecy, to in-
dicate one or more priests whom they
consider worthy and suitable for the
episcopacy.
3. At the meeting, an oath of secrecy
is to be taken and all human con-
siderations laid aside: each candidate
will then be discussed to ascertain
whether he possesses all the qualities
required for the episcopacy.
4. After the discussion, there will
be a secret vote on each candidate.
5. The Bishops will see to it that
only the names of the more suitable
candidates for this office are forwarded
to the Apostolic Delegate.
6. Minutes of the meeting are to be
kept and jt copy is to be forwarded
to the Sacred Congregation of the
Propagation of the Faith through the
Apostolic Delegate.”
Critics of the 1937 decree claim
that not only has the selection of
Bishops by Bishops tended to rob the
church of vigorous and imaginative
episcopal leadership, but that in many
provinces lip service only is paid to
paragraph two: that parish priests,
who are often in the best position to
judge another man’s pastoral value,
have, in fact, little or no say in
appointments.
Of the present Australian hierarchy,
seven became Bishops prior to the 1937
Council: Bishops Gilroy, Farrelly, Fox
(Wilcannia), Hensche, Simonds, O’Col-
lins, and Prendiville.
Of the 26 appointed since (I ex-
Archbishop Young
elude three who are from the mis-
sionary congregation which cares for
the missionary areas 'of Darwin,
Geraldton, and 1 Broome, Bishops
O’Loughlin, Gomez, Jobst), 13 became
Bishops in Australia as auxiliaries (one
of these was previously Bishop of a
diocese in N.Z.) and three became
Bishops as coadjutors with the right
of succession. The other ten were
appointed directly to the care of a
diocese. Four have moved from the
position of auxiliary to the full care of
a diocese, while one has moved to
coadjutor with the right of succession.
There are at present eight auxiliaries,
one with the personal title of Arch-
bishop (Carroll).
fpHAT there has been deep dissatis-
faction about some of these appoint-
ments can scarcely be denied, nor
can the corollary that some of the pre-
sent Australian Catholic hierarchy
would have been outside chances in
any election determined by the votes
of the rank-and-file clergy.
The concern of some priests for the
manner of episcopal appointments was
stirred into anticipation when the
status of Bishops was raised at the
Vatican Council. A number of draft
documents on Bishops and the govern-
ments of dioceses were submitted and
amended on the role of Bishops, but
amidst the “prudent counsels,” “the
fullness and sufficiency of powers,”
“the profound spiritualitys,” etc., was
buried little consolation for those who
want a more democratic election pro-
cedure.
As one Melbourne priest put it at a
clerical conference recently, the con-
stitution itself adopts a negative aspect
-—excluding any interference with or
limitation of the right of the supreme
Pontiff to nominate and appoint
Bishops. However, in the Decree of
implementation a more positive
approach is evident: episcopal confer-
ences shall “with prudent counsel and
in secret each year consider ecclesiastics
to be promoted and propose their names
to the Apostolic See.”
This Decree is no advance on the
system which has operated in Aus-
tralia since 1937, except that the meet-
ings of Bishops to select future Bishops
are to be annual, and the meetings are

According to one New South Wales
priest: “The new provision, even at
best, does not provide any real voice

Council documents do refer to the
setting up of councils of priests in
dioceses, and it is possible that indi-
vidual Bishops may refer to these
councils for advice and even selection
of those names to be put forward at
the National Episcopal Conference. It
is understood that a meeting of priests
in Hobart this year suggested that the
rank-and-file clergy be given a much
greater say in the appointment of
Bishops and that Archbishop Young
has accepted this suggestion and will
table it at the next conference of Aus-

White’s
Conscience
By MONTY DENNISON
THE hearing had lasted almost four
hours. It was the end of the last
week before the Christmas holi-
days. It was also the end of a long,
unsettled year for the young man be-
fore the bench. If he failed now, there
would be little hope of another chance.
When the decision was finally
announced in his favor, it was as if
every spectator had suddenly gained
his freedom. The courtroom burst
into spontaneous applause.
The magistrate, upset by what he
termed a “disgraceful interruption,”
ordered the immediate clearing of the
courtroom. As the excited spectators
filed out, the young man’s mother
leaned over and kissed him; his attrac-
tive fiancee wept quietly. The young
man’s barrister rose and expressed re-
grets for the outbursts.
So it was in the quiet of an empty
courtroom that conscientious objector
William White last week officially re-
ceived what must have been his best
Christmas present, total exemption
from National Service. White had
been seeking the exemption for a year;
during that time he had appealed
twice to courts, been dismissed from his
job as a teacher, and been court-
martialled by the Army.
had met so many disappoint-
ments, he had not allowed himself
to think this time it might be different.
Others, however, were more hopeful.
The turning point had come four days
earlier when Mr. C. S. Rodgers, the
magistrate who denied White’s first
exemption request, decided not to hear
the second application and graciously
turned over jurisdiction to another
magistrate “in the interests of justice.”
The magistrate was Mr. C. K. Ward,
of Sydney’s Central Court. White told
him essentially the same things he had
told Mr. Rodgers and the man who up-
held Mr. Rodgers’ decision, District
Court Judge Cameron-Smith.
Looking haggard and worn, White
said he had had a strong sense of
compassion for any form of suffering
since a child. He believed that war
and killing were wrong and that “war
is nothing more than two individuals
attempting to kill each other.” In
conscience, he could not take part in
any organisation whose aim was to kill.
The magistrate listened intently,
first leaning forward, then resting his
chin on one hand. Seldom did he
interrupt White’s testimony to ask

questions, as Judge Cameron-Smith had
done. Shortly after the hearing opened,
he looked at the 20-odd people stand-
ing at the rear of the crowded court-
room, called for a clerk, and then
explained with a smile, “I’m making
arrangements for a bigger room.” After
the morning adjournment, the hearing
resumed in a different courtroom.
For the Department of Labor and
National Service, Mr. J. Smail, a large
man with a salt-and-pepper beard, re-
peatedly asked White questions in an
effort to plumb his conscience. Is
it right to kill a person in self-defence?
Should a person train to protect him-
self? What would you do if you were
attacked by a man with a piece of
wood? Does Australia have the right
to take up arms in its defence?
Several times White prefaced his
answers with the word “ideally.” Just
as often, Mr. Smail countered with
the word “practically.” Mr. Smail
seemed sympathetic toward White, but
continued questioning him. White
said he could conceive of a world where
no country had an army and where
no forcible restraint was liecessary by
any country. He advocated that Aus-
tralia give up its military establishment
and instead set up a peace force with
the same amount of money and effort
to help other countries.
Even the most optimistic must have
found these views utterly idealistic. It
is not surprising then that the magis-
William White and his sister Katheryn after his exemption
trate described White’s beliefs as illogi-
cal, somewhat naive, and immature.
What is surprising is that it took so
long for White to convince the courts
of his conscience. As the magistrate
pointed out, White had a genuine
and conscientious belief which he had
apparently held for a long time.
Yet, Judge Cameron-Smith found
that White had come to his conclusion
in a short time. If nothing else, this
discrepancy demonstrates the in-
adequacy of a system whereby a per-
son must prove his conscience in a
courtroom. It also demonstrates the
arbitrary nature of determining a per-
son’s conscience. Judge Cameron-Smith
apparently thought it significant that
White’s views were “without a proper
basis either of learning or of logic or
with regard to what is going on in the
world today.” While Mr. Ward thought
the beliefs naive and immature, he
nevertheless found that White held
them. And this, after all, was all he
had to determine.
Clearly, a better system is needed.
Now would seem the time to investigate
the possibility of setting up a tribunal
of lay people or even of magistrates to
determine conscientious objector
exemptions. In any case, there is no
reason why the hearings of professed
conscientious objectors should not be
distributed evenly among several
magistrates instead of one. White has
won his case, but will the next true
conscientious objector win his?


The Man of the Year
The National Serviceman 1966
By T. B. MILLAR
LAST year’s heated public debate
on whether Australia should send
National Servicemen to Vietnam
and the unusual degree of public sup-
port for our doing so which the recent
elections revealed have obscured an
equally important aspect of the prob-
lem: whether National Service has been
militarily effective. With a somewhat
surprised relief, Army authorities have
discovered that the scheme has worked
as well as they had dared to hope and
much better than many expected.
A major reason for this is the “one
army” concept stubbornly held to at
all levels despite Press and public pre-
occupation with the compulsory en-
listees. Learning from the mistakes of
previous schemes, the Army decided to
integrate National Servicemen as far
as possible with the Regular Army, to
encourage them to identify themselves
fully with their formation, corps, unit
or sub-unit as members of a single
team. National Servicemen are not
second-class soldiers. Within the limits
imposed by a two-year term of service,
they enjoy equal facilities, pay, pros-
pects, suffer equal tedium and hard-
ship with the regulars. They provide
their proportion of NCOs, and some
280 have been commissioned as officers
after a gruelling six months’ course at
Scheyville, N.S.W.
These officers are serving through-
out the Army, as platoon commanders
in Vietnam, with artillery and other
arms, as instructors in recruit training
battalions, and on headquarters. Any-
thing less like the public image of a
reluctant conscript it would be hard
to imagine. Although none has yet
served his prescribed term (the first
intake will not be due for discharge
until the end of June), eight officers
and about a hundred soldiers have
volunteered ror the Regular Army, even
though the Army has deliberately re-
frained from exerting pressure on
National Servicemen to become regu-
lars.
'JHE National Serviceman posted to
a unit, at whatever rank, soon finds
that whether he gains the confidence,
friendship or respect of the regulars
and of his fellow National Servicemen
depends on only one thing: whether
he earns them. In combat, as in train-
ing, each sub-unit is a team, and every
member of the team counts. If the for-
ward scout signals enemy in sight or
if the corporal orders you to take a
particular action, you do not ask
whether he is a National Serviceman
or a regular. Life is too precious. :he
experienced sergeant with a raw
platoon commander has to help edu-
cate him whether he is a graduate of
Duntroon, Portsea, or Scheyville. The
graduates of Scheyville, according to
reports, have proved themselves as
competent and as daring as their regu-
lar fellow platoon commanders. Any
officer who does not measure up in
combat is sent out, whatever his terms
of enlistment. A C.O. in Vietnam,
asked recently how his National Service
officers were doing, had to think care-
fully before answering; he had to re-
mind himself which of his officers
were National Servicemen.
If the “one-army” concept has been
so rewarding, Army authorities insist
also that the calibre of National
Servicemen is extremely good. They
constitute a cross section of the com-
munity, comparable in almost all
respects with the regulars. Troops in
or going to an overseas area are usually
keener, more interested, less of a dis-
ciplinary problem than ones in field
units in Australia, but this applies
equally to regulars and to National
Servicemen. There is no evident differ-
ence in the offence rate of the two
groups.
A THIRD reason for the success of
x National Service is the high pro-
fessional skill of the Regular Army
and the high proportion of experienced
regulars in any unit. The proportion of
regulars is a key factor in the overall
efficiency of the Army. If National
Servicemen constituted too high a pro-
portion, the general level of experience
would drop, and the numbers of men
available for promotion to higher NCO
and Warrant rank would be insufficient.
National Servicemen must enter, and
must feel, they are entering, a profes-
sional unit. This is why National Ser-
vice cannot expand more rapidly than
the Regular Army (in proportion) in-
creases.
At present there are some 1200
National Servicemen (out of a net
intake of 12,000) in Vietnam, and 300
in Malaysia—in each case less than a
third of Army strength there. In units
stationed in Australia the proportion
would be higher. But there is clearly
a critical level, perhaps different for
different arms and services, beyond
which an increase in the proportion
of National Servicemen would have a
deleterious effect on the overall effi-
ciency.
Only a third of each National Ser-
vice intake is allocated to the infantry.
About ten percent go to each of Artil-
lery, Engineers, and Army Service
Corps; but every corps (except, pre-
sumably, the Chaplains’) receive some.
Where possible, the man’s own desires
are satisfied, as well as his aptitudes
and skills. Obviously, there are some
skills which are more in demand in
civilian life than in an Army field force,
and men cannot always stay in the
“slot” to which they have been trained
before they joined the Army.
But there is a more important point.
Anyone who has served in the Armed
Forces will know that the qualities of
leadership, of initiative and decision
and steadiness under tension, so essen-
tial for combat officers, are not con-
fined to men who have had no civilian
specialist training. The Army is given
a military role by the nation, and is
expected to make the best use of the
manpower it has. From the point of
military effectiveness, combat effi-
ciency and the saving of lives, the best
platoon commander in a battalion may
have been a butcher or a banker in
civil life. And military service often
brings out aptitudes the soldier never
knew he had, enthusiasms he never
realised he was capable of. When he
becomes' part of a team., the team be-
comes part of him.
A scheme this size is not without
its problems. One of the biggest is
that intakes of large numbers at fixed
periods (as compared with the steady
dribble of regular recruits) make
heavy demands on training facilities
and personnel. The high rate of turn-
over of personnel has multiplied the
Army’s administrative burden. Ia
addition, the comparatively short
period of service limits the amount
of specialist training and restricts the
areas of employment. And clearly,
every National Serviceman is not go-
ing to be “highly motivated” toward
the Army. Most of them had no de-
sire to be soldiers. But the inescapable
fact is that the great majority, once
they are in the Army, are keen to do
as good a job as possible, and to be
and look as much like regulars as
possible. Perhaps this is the Boy Scout
in (almost) every man. But it also
reflects the fact that the idea of
National Service, of contributing to the
defence of Australia, is accepted by
them and by most of their families.
Many of their fathers, of course, saw
service in World AVar 11.
rpo a very small proportion of men
balloted, National Service training
is offensive. The provisions for con-
scientious objectors to be exempted
from service, or to do only non-
combat training and service, covers
almost all cases. But occasionally a
determined objector meets an un-
sympathetic magistrate, and between
them and the law they give the Army
a problem it should never have and
would dearly avoid if it could. There
is a clear need for additional legislation
on this point. There should be a means
to adjust situations such as that affect-
ing Mr. William White. Perhaps a
special tribunal could be constituted,

By its effects on young men, National
Service undoubtedly has its social ad-
vantages, and it is these that prompt
enthusiasts to demand that every 20-
year-old in the country should be
called up. This would be a military
disaster under the present circum-
stances. The Regular Army would be
able to do little else than train
National Servicemen. There would be
only a very small field force, if any.
There have been other propositions,
such as using National Servicemen on
national developmental works. This is
a separate issue, worth examining on
its own merits, but only indirectly rele-
vant to the problem of providing a
military combat capacity, for which
the present scheme was introduced.
Unless something unforeseen occurs,
National Service will give Australia an
army of over 40,000 during this year,
as Sir Robert Menzies said it would
when he introduced it in 1964. Of
these, some 7000 will be under train-
ing at any one time. The present in-
take rate means that we can have eight
full infantry battalions, plus arms and
services a peacetime field force un-
precedented in Australian history. It
may be arguable that Australia does
not need such forces. It is not really
arguable that National Service has not
made them possible.
Australian National Servicemen have
been killed, wounded, and decorated
for valor in Vietnam. Nearly 20 have
been killed or died of wounds. (The
United States has lost 6000 men in
battle deaths.) This is news, and is
understandably played up in the Press.
But it is surely time for a more bal-
anced consideration of the role and
activities of the whole of the Army,
and indeed of all our forces. The life
of a National Serviceman is no less
and no more precious, to himself, his
family, and the nation than the life
of a regular. National Service is here
to stay, so long as it is needed. But it
provides only a portion of the Army
and no part of the other Services.
Every Australian serviceman is render-
ing a national service. Every one de-
serves the nation’s interest and support.
LETTERS
Indonesia’s PKI
Sir,
As one who has not always agreed
with Dr. Knopfelmacher on interpreta-
tions of domestic issues, I should like
to say, as a frequent visitor to Indo-
nesia, that his three days in Djakarta
were well spent and his rejoinder (8.,
Dec. 24) to Mr. Mortimer on PKI
complicity in Gestapu was accurate so
far as I am concerned.
However, I part company with him
on paragraph three of his letter, in
which he reaffirms his view that PKI
leaders were not only involved in
Gestapu but were also personally cor-
rupt. The question of corruption in
Indonesia is relative. I have never come
across well-founded evidence that PKI
leaders were corrupt in the grand Indo-
nesian sense. They certainly lived com-
fortably (but less so than others), they
certainly had money (less than others),
they certainly had status and privileges
(two, after all, were Members of outer
Cabinet). I doubt that they would have
proved or been regarded as politically
effective if, in a conspicuous consumer
society, they had lived austerely.
It is not quite good enough for Dr.
Knopfelmacher to quote KAMI sources
in particular as offering proof positive
of PKI corruption in high places. Of
course, KAMI (and KAPI and KASI)
wish to bruit it around that PKI mem-
bers comprised not only deadly political
enemies but a bunch of corrupt,
pleasure-loving voluptuaries. Surely
this is essential from their point of view
as in a society in which every man is
notably for himself it is important to
believe that PKI members were even
more so and that there was a more
than usually scandalous difference be-
tween PKI social teachings and practice.

Experimental Art
Sir,
Mr. H. D. Nicolson complains (8.,
Dec. 3) about my misreading of
his introduction to the catalogue of the
Transfield exhibition. The following
complete quotation from the introduc-
tion should justify my feeling that Mr.
Nicolson revealed a retardataire resent-
ment of some modern experiments, and
preferred the more traditional materials
that were predominant in the exhibition:
“Some contemporary shows of plastic
art rudely stare back at the onlooker
with an if-you-can-look-at-me-I-can-
look-at-you mirror of vulgar taste. Such
shows are providing works that move,
use optical illusions, show bright colors,
enlarge popular images, borrow cut-outs,
or even use more violent means of visual
confrontation. A sculptor may adopt
such methods simply in despair of being
contemporary in a fast-moving world
where so many insist you must be ‘with
it.’ There can be little doubt about the
contemporary nature of these works as
they did not occur before now, but
in so far as they measure the viewpoint
of the viewer they are presumption and
not communication. Though such works
are catching the eye of publicists in
1966, their quality will, in the long run,
be tested against the achievements of
sculptors such as those exhibiting and
other artists in the broader range of
plastic arts.” Surely the whole tone of
that is sneeringly dismissive of recent
experimental art?
ELWYN LYNN
P.S. As you will see, Mr. Nicolson
only quoted that part of his original
statement that suited his interpretation
of his introduction.

Slessor’s Poetry
Sir,
I am sorry that Thomas W. Shap-
cott (8., Dec 17) reviewed my
monograph on Kenneth Slessor with-
out apparently taking the trouble to
read it properly (even if he did read
the first paragraph). “Slessor’s one
poem on a bushranger theme,” he
wrote, “is not referred to in the text?’
Indeed it is on pages 24 and 25,
and, in fact, I quote three verses from
it!
Mr. Shapcott is right when he sug-
gests the essay is a work of introduc-
tion naturally, since it is in a
British series. But as for its merits as
an “analysis in depth” and its “final
sense of authoritativeness,” I suppose
it’s up to the reader who knows the
poetry to judge. Kenneth Slessor,
whom I’ve only met twice in my life,
was a reader; he wrote to me, inter
alia:
“. . . I feel moved by the way in
which you have got to the heart of
things. Your perception, in fact, aston-
ishes me. You have picked and stressed
exactly the lines I cherish myself and
given them the meaning I meant for
them. I have never had this from criti-
cism before . . .”

“Men of Nobility!"
Sir,
Geoffrey Fairbairn, reviewing “Andre
Malraux. The Indo-China Adventure”
(8., Dec. 17), has many interesting
comments to make, but with due
respect he shows complete ignorance
about the Nazi army or State when
(referring to the fact that “men of great
nobility have opted for the Communist
‘solution’ ”) he writes but there
were men of great nobility who for
years served the Nazi armies and the
Nazi State. So what?”
I would be interested if he could
name some of these noblemen he had
in mind. May I ask him sincerely what
it stood for, because at previous times
I have noticed that he is completely
ignorant on the matter. This rebuke
is not meant personally because many
reviewers in isolated Australia have only
book knowledge and have not experi-
enced the real meaning of Nazi atroci-
ties.

ONE MORE
WEEK
A Note from Dr. Coombs
THE GOVERNOR of the Reserve
Bank, Dr. Coombs, dwelling in the
bank’s marble halls, probably has a
very different view of $lO from the
average wage-earner. After all, he
earns more of them, so that he can
stand the loss more easily if someone
slips him a forged one and his bank
won’t honor it. Also he makes them, so
badly, apparently, that they are easy
to forge efficiently.
But Dr. Coombs’ bank, having helped
the forgers along with notes which are
easy to copy, has been quick to offer
a little more help. If banks won’t
honor forged $lO these, and any other
notes forgers care to run off, can re-
main in circulation indefinitely. Be-
cause what does Dr. Coombs really
think the average wage-earner will do
if he gets a forged $10? Accept a volun-
tary fine of $lO because someone else
has broken the law and destroy the
note? Or hang on to it until he can
pass it on to someone else?
Winning the War
TEN YEARS ago last week, entries
for the Sydney Opera House competi-
tion closed. The main requirement
was pretty clear; Sydney wanted a
concert hall in which opera could also
be played—but only if this did not
damage in any way its quality as a
concert hall. In the nine years he
worked on the scheme, Joern Utzon
was unable to design a hall that fitted
that requirement.
When he resigned at the end of
February, 1966, the idea for the
main hall he had been working on
since 1963 was shown to be quite un-
satisfactory for concerts, not simply
because the seating was jammed up
(and probably totalled 2500-odd in-
stead of 2800), but also because the
acoustics did not suit the concert tenant
—the ABC. Utzon’s reverberation time
was an uneasy half-way position be-
tween the two seconds needed for con-
certs and the 1.2 seconds or so wanted
for an Opera House.
But if Utzon could not solve the
dual hall problem, neither could the
new panel; it seems impossible to get
one hall that will serve both these
functions with the degree of excellence
required.
The decision by the new architectural
panel to suggest to the Government
that it throw opera out of the major
hall (where it was planned to use
only 1800 of the 2800 seats for opera,
anyway) and put it into the minor
hall (where the seating is to be in-
creased from 1200 to 1500) has the
wholehearted support of the acoustic
consultant, Dr. Jordan, and also of
the theatre designer, Mr. Ben Schlanger,
who recently advised on the project.
The implications of this for concerts
are that now the ABC will definitely
move its subscription series to the
Opera House concert hall, and make
the building its “home”; the implica-
tions for opera are that the audience
seating will be reduced by 300, and
that the stage machinery will be far
less satisfactory than had been planned
for the major hall whose $3 million
worth of lifts and rollers and so on,
which had already been delivered, will
have to go and it will be very Jhard
to find buyers.
So after ten years the Opera House
is to return to its original conception
as a concert hall above all else; this
is the reason that prompted the new
architectural partnership of Hall Todd
and Littlemore to get rid of the opera
machinery rather than questions of cost.
The new proposals have every chance
of being approved, although later this
month the Opera House Trust (to
whom the matters were not referred),
the Elizabethan Theatre Trust, and the
ABC will get together to discuss the
possibility of compromises. So although
the music men at the ABC may have
lost many of their battles with the
opera buffs in the Opera House affair
over the past ten years, it looks as if
they have won the war.
Abstracts in Industry
THE MAN who brought Billy Graham
to Australia, a feat he plans to repeat
next year, is Mr. Bruce Ogden,
managing director of CRO furniture,
who is at the present time enmeshed
in a fascinating spider web of construc-
tive material called the System
Abstracta.
Designed five years ago by Danish
architect Poul Cadovius, this is basic-
ally a universal connector which will
join round or square tubes in any
form. Ranging in size from Jin. to
ljin., the system can make up any-
thing from a bird cage to a scaffold.
In Jutland, Cadovius is building a
whole township. While joined up the
System Abstracta has complete rigidity,
but it can be knocked to pieces very
quickly. No piece of steel tubing need
be longer than five feet even for the
construction of large shelters.
Bruce Ogden is a furniture manu-
facturer and he came upon the
Cadovius system accidentally while
overseas on a routine buying mission.
He was so fascinated by its potential
that he could not sleep for two nights.
He obtained the right to produce it
under licence in Australia. The con-
nectors are die cast and the tube is
rather like water pipe.
Once, he had achieved the rights to
the system, Ogden approached its Aus-
tralian debut rather timidly. He con-
centrated on small display units. How-
ever, the System Abstracta, which
Cadovius himself feels will in time
take over the world of building, has
not been contained. Banks and
Government institutions have bought
it up for displays of art, the Israeli
Government has decided on its use for
all exhibitions wherever they are staged
in the world, a school in Brisbane used
it for a portable classroom, the Ford
Company displayed their new Falcons
under it, and the Defence Department
is seriously considering its use for helU
copter hangars in jungle warfare. The
whole hangar unit including the plastic
skin cover could be dropped from an
aircraft in a bag and erected in a
matter of hours. A house can go up in
ninety minutes.
The system was almost immediately
copied by an English company which
produced a similar type of jointing for
square tubes only and managed to get
around the copyright by using addi-
tional plastic insets and by having a
slight variation in the basic connector.
This is highly efficient too and its
use is spreading round the world. In
fact, the whole idea has a mild con-
notation of the horror movie. Will we
all eventually be surrounded on all
sides by the terribly simple, devilishly
stable bars of neat cold steel? Or
will Billy Graham get here in time to
save us?

AROUND MELBOURNE
The Napoleon Solo Caper
TO be perfectly honest, I had
never been a devoted viewer
of “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”
My first encounter with Mr. Robert
Vaughn, alias Napoleon Solo, was
in the American magazine “Gentle-
man’s Quarterly.” There were a
number of full-page advertisements
of those fine fighters of international
evil Messrs. Solo and Iliya Kurya-
kin. The message in the ads was
that for casual, aggressive, devil-
may-care occasions you could be
Iliya in dark tight pants and white
turtle-necked sweater. For late
evenings, when you were outwitting
rather more polished evil, you could
be Napoleon Solo in a dark blue
double-breasted blazer with gold-
pounded buttons and inside a flash-
ing green-on-black paisley lining.
The ad said that Mr. Solo had
an “impeccable, innate gift of taste”
and it went on to say “will Thrush
give in and say U.N.C.L.E.? TV
mirrors the restless age, and out of
this age comes the restless man. He
wants exciting things, his fashion
appetite is insatiable, price doesn’t
stand in his way.”
So you see, pre-armed with this
knowledge, one wouldn’t for a
second reject an invitation to meet
Mr. Vaughn at lunch. At Essen-
don Airport on the Friday morning,
he was mobbed by 500 screaming
fans, and according to the Mel-
bourne “Herald” he was mobbed,
mauled, kissed, hugged, and inter-
viewed. Just an hour or so later
more than 1000 screaming fans
were there to mob, maul, kiss, hug,
and interview Normie Rowe on his
homecoming from London, and
there were 20ft. posters pro-
claiming “We love you, Normie.”
The lunch was at the John Bat-
man Motor Inn, where the Man from
U.N.C.L.E. was staying. Your
correspondent, innocently, had ex-
pected to meet both U.N.C.L.E.
men, Napoleon and Iliya. Why no
Iliya? And one man with inside
knowledge replied: “Don’t say any-
thing about this. They don’t get
on. Can’t stand each other. Very
embarrassing. They have to put
them round the world separately,
so they don’t meet. Originally
Vaughn was the top star, but then
the fans went crazy for David Mc-
Callum, so much so they had to
give him equal star billing.”
Well, who is having lunch today?
“Vaughn. He asked to dine with
pretty girls, so we have lined up
six of them.”
Mr. Solo came down from his
suite at the John Batman at 1.15
and one immediately checked on
his impeccable-innate-gift-of-taste
rating. The restless man earned
high marks. He was wearing a
dark blue single-breasted suit, a
plain dark blue tie, and he had a
pale blue long - lapelled, button-
down collar shirt that was unques-
tionably Brooks Brothers; on his
left hand he was wearing a gold
ring with a star sapphire, a perfect
match for his all-blue ensemble. His
hands, actually, were small, pale,
and beautifully kept; obviously he
didn’t punch anybody when check-
ing international evil.
Your correspondent sat down on
his left, on his right was Miss
Frankie Lightfoot, the ex-Miss Vic-
toria, a little farther down we had
two Miss Teenage winners, a Miss
Teenage runner-up, and several of
our leading models. Frankly, it
was a damned awkward situation;
your correspondent wasn’t nearly as
attractive as the rest of the party.
Mr. Vaughn spent 99.5 percent of
the time looking at Miss Lightfoot;
however, with the .5 percent re-
maining time he picked up some
interesting information written care-
fully on his table napkin.
H E denies that he doesn’t get -on
with David McCallum. Emphat-
ically, he said: “This fight business
is a lot of nonsense, we are good
friends.” He did not explain why
they did not arrive together for
the Melbourne premiere of “One
of our Spies is Missing.”
Much of the conversation, as in
all such interviews, was on the
bachelor status of Mr. Vaughn. He
was utterly and definitely solo. Ah,
but what about that line: “The girl
I marry will have to be a beautiful
rich Boston heiress who rides to
hounds.”
He said, “That remark had dog-
ged me for years, when I said it I
had a smile on my face, but it is very
hard to get a smile into print . . .
but, you know, it wouldn’t be a bad
idea, would it?”
Now here was a more interesting
line of country. Was he Boston Irish?
—“Yes.” What did he think of the
censoring of Manchester’s book? —
“It doesn’t make much difference
now. There are Xeroxed copies of
the unabridged book all over the
United States, it’s the ‘in’ thing to
have one.”
Was he interested in politics?—
“All Boston Irish love politics. It’s
second nature.”
Did he plan to run for the Sen-
ate?—“Certainly not.” Frightened of
old films being dug up for the cam-
paign? —“Well, maybe. You know,
when Reagan was running for Gov-
ernor somebody dug up all his old
films, cut out little bits of love
scenes here and there, odd bits of
conversation, and connected them
up, all in one film. Then this was
shown at a Hollywood party. It was
the funniest thing you ever saw.”
Well, even if he didn’t intend to
run, what were his politics?— “Ken-
nedy-Democrat.”
Did he approve of the American
commitment in Vietnam?—“No. I
think you have a lot more reason
to be there tfian we have.” Would
he pull out immediately?—“No, but
I tbink we should immediately start
a gradual withdrawal. We’re not
achieving anything, we should never
have gone there in the first place.”
And what would have happened
then? “Vietnam would have become
a Communist country. All right,
what of it? Name one country where
the Communists have succeeded.
Look at Albania. They haven’t suc-
ceeded anywhere in Africa. We’ve
got Communists on the brain.”
What else did we learn? “The
Man from U.N.C.L.E.” had changed
since it first began three years ago.
The first episodes were far more
subtle. Too subtle. People didn’t
realise it was meant to be a spoof,
so they hammed it up much more.
Did he want to get out of
U.N.C.L.E.?—“Very definitely. I
want to get back to making films.”
Only two and a half men had ever
really made the transition from TV
to movies Steve McQueen and
James Gamer and Dick van Dyke,
sort of.
Why?—“TV’s different. Almost
anyone can do that. On movies
you’ve got to have a much bigger
personality. Some sort of spark that
goes—we call it mush.” (Rhymes
with push.)
One suspected Mr. Vaughn had
enough mush. We learned further
that he lived in Hollywood in a
$lOO,OOO home with a high stone
wall and a big electric gate to keep
out difficult fans.
He took out a cigar-case filled
with cheroots. He offered one to
Frankie Lightfoot and she took it.
Here was another opportunity, was
the Man from U.N.C.L.E. smoking
suspect Cuban cheroots?—“No, these
are Brazilian. You sure can’t buy
Cuban cigars in the U.S. But, you
know, a while back a certain V.I.P.
asked me to pick him up some in
Copenhagen.”
Yes, international evil is every-
where.

Godfrey’s Winning Ways
Life as a British Institution
BY APRIL HERSEY
Godfrey winn, who achieves
15,000 words a week for English
“Woman” magazine and others in
the Cecil King International Publishing
Company organisation, appears to be
the ultimate in journalists. He earned
a staggering £stg.so,ooo last year,
though most of this was given to the
Government in taxes.
Still, with what he has left he can
run his London house, his Georgian
home in Sussex, have servants, including
a chauffeur, and a full office staff. When
he walks down the street in London he
is besieged for autographs. He cannot
ride in a taxi without being spotted.
His voice, heard by millions on tele-
vision, is recognised over public tele-
phones. Letters from fans pour in for
him. He is a national institution.
Somewhat startled by the possibility
that a fellow journalist can rise to such
astronomical heights, I was relieved to
hear that he is regarded as a phenome-
non.
The twist in fate that propelled him
to the point where he can earn more
than a busy film star was an assignment
to write about the North Country town
Jarrow. This was in 1936, at the worst
period of unemployment in Britain. The
story was prompted by the “hunger”
march of the men of Jarrow on West-
minster. Their march achieved nothing
more than fresh-faced Godfrey Winn,
aged 25, and a budding freelance
columnist with six novels behind him.
A product of an expensive preparatory
school, a broken home, and instead of
Rugby a Grammar School, protege of
Somerset Maugham, and white-headed
boy for the London “Daily Mirror,” he
had no idea where Jarrow was when
he started the assignment.
What he found there, a whole town
unemployed, “changed my whole life.”
It was such a story of courage and
endurance and, without doing much
more than record it, Godfrey Winn
became synonymous with Britain’s social
conscience.
He feels that the impact of these
people on him at a very impressionable
time had almost a religious significance.
He wrote no more novels and from then
on, though he has written 19 books, he
has concentrated on “portraits of
people.”
“I think that I found in Jarrow that
I had the sort of writing gift which
could stir people to do something.
Southern cities adopted the town of
Jarrow and I know that things are
fine in Jarrow now. Once I knew that
I could serve some purpose as a journal-
istic messenger, open the doors of the
imagination, and show each side how
the other half was living, I knew that I
had to use it. I have been doing that
ever since.”
No one meeting Godfrey Winn could
doubt his absolute sincerity. Though
he speaks in the same flowery style in
which he writes, constantly offering
“messages,” his blue eyes shine with
enthusiasm. He cannot resist questioning
one about topics ranging from the posi-
tion of women’s skirts in Australia to
the position of women themselves in
Australia. His quest for knowledge is
enormous and his professionalism appar-
ent. His hands are obviously itching to
get back to work on the battered Royal
portable machine surrounded by papers
on the hotel desk.
Devoted for most of his life to his
“Mama,” who sounds as though she
Godfrey Winn
was a very formidable lady egging her
two fatherless sons on to success (the
other is Lord Justice Winn), Godfrey
Winn is not married and, in fact, prefers
to have a chaperon about when talking
to his lady fans “in case they become
hysterical,” but he is an enthusiastic
feminist and “if I have a message for
Australian women it is to stop huddling
in corners at parties and to get in there
where the executive discussions are
going on.”
Rather like a gentle caricature of
everyone’s favorite uncle, Godfrey Winn
is a dapper English gentleman who
says things like: “Terrible if people
had no reaction to me, what?” and calls
Qantas “Quawntas.” It is very easy to
imagine him busy in his English garden.
He denies that everything he writes
is kind and, in fact, has been a war
correspondent covering the Russian
front and flying with the RAF. He has
also written about Cyprus and
Rhodesia. With the support of Scotland
Yard he investigated the teenage
problem in England.
“But mostly I write about people. If
I have one particular talent it is prob-
ably that I can bring a character to
life. I can remember dialogue easily. I
never make notes. I honestly believe
writing talent is much like a talent for
golf or cricket. It is there, often enough,
but only discipline will bring it to
fruition.”
His other talent is speed in writing.
In 1966 he wrote 500,000 words, includ-
ing 150,000 on his autobiography.
He says: “When I am included in a
magazine the circulation jumps by
100,000. These people are personal fans.
It is sometimes rather frightening to
think that everything I write has such an
audience. But I’m usually so busy work-
ing to get the piece finished in time that
I don’t think about this. So many
people are inclined to say: ‘Oh, God-
frey Winn he just turns on the tap
and there it is.’ It isn’t that easy. The
public is enormously perceptive. Sin-
cerity can’t be faked. They would know
in a minute if I were not writing the
truth because so often they can identify
with the people I write about.
“I have had some fascinating inter-
views, the Pope this year and the
Duchess of Windsor, many others—all
offered to me on a plate. But I prefer
to write about people who are not in
the news. Whether it is a story of
courage or stupidity doesn’t seem to
matter, because either has universal
significance.”
Despite his Don Quixote image, Winn
admits he has always been expensive.
His original column in the “Daily
Mirror” brought him $8 each day. Now
he charges $6OO for each television
program, has both a newspaper and a
magazine contract for which publishers
may bid.
Why when he has already made so
much money does he keep on producing
at this staggering rate? “A writer
becomes dead if he is only remembering.
You have to go on.”
Going on in Australia involves such
diverse occupations as visiting lonely
British migrants, sharing Christmas at a
grand reunion with friends Googie and
John McCallum, whose bottle of cham-
pagne had arrived before him at his
hotel to cheer him on, calling on Lord
and Lady Casey and other notables in
Canberra; writing his impressions of
Sydney (unique and so unlike
America); Australian women (very like
the British but they must get themselves
elected to Parliament); the Australians
(so direct and friendly) or to tell it in
his own words: “I wanted to experience
at first-hand The Great Adventure of
going to Australia, so here I am after
a year of steady writing, on the wings
of the morning as it were, what?”

NEW YORK LETTER
Congressman on the Run
From GEORGE McGANN
TH E nation’s
largest pic-
ture magazine
in its current issue
carries a photo-
graph of an
American fugitive
from justice,
holed up on the
Caribbean island
of Bimini and
carrying a shot-
gun with which
he had just threatened to kill the
photographer. A bright news shot in
itself, the photographer gains added
piquancy from the fact that the armed
fugitive is United States Congressman
Adam Clayton Powell.
The handsome, moustached Negro
Congressman is on the lam in Bimini
because he is subject to arrest and
three months’ imprisonment for crimi-
nal contempt of court in his home
State of New York and it appears
likely that he will never go home to
Harlem again. But that does not mean
that he will be forced to surrender his
seat in the House although tentative
moves toward that end have been
initiated in the garish light of his
recent brushes with the law • or that
he would not be re-elected in absentia
should he choose to run for Congress
when his present term expires in 1968.
The circumstance of a high Govern-
ment official thumbing his nose at the
laws that he is sworn to uphold, and
getting away with it, is one of the more
intriguing aspects of the current Civil
Rights struggle in the United States. It
goes without saying that if Representa-
tive Powell were a white man he defi-
nitely would not be getting away with it.
Despite nay, largely because of
recent headlines recounting Repre-
sentative Powell’s refusal to pay a
$164,000 judgment arising from a defa-
mation of character suit against him
and his subsequent conviction for con-
tempt of court, to say nothing of his
many excursions to Europe and Miami
with lovely young women at Govern-
ment expense, and the flagrant nepotism
of placing his non-working wife on the
Federal payroll, the flamboyant legis-
lator was returned to office with a
whopping majority of 85 percent of the
votes in the November election,
although he dared not come into his
district to campaign because the police
had orders to pick him up on sight.
For a long period during his legal
battle with Mrs. Esther James, a
Harlem resident who successfully
pressed a defamation of character suit
on the ground that he had publicly
branded her a “bag woman” or graft
collector for crooked cops, Powell
would sneak into New York on Sunday,
when he had immunity from arrest,
change into clerical garb, and preach
to the congregation of the huge Abys-
sinian Baptist Church, of which he has
been pastor for more than 20 years.
However, his contempt of court con-
viction closed that loophole and the
shepherd can no longer comfort the
flock every Sunday. His parishioners
take a kind of perverse pride in their
pastor’s unclerical behaviour.
Powell’s troubles with Mrs. James
and subsequently with the Law arose
from his effort to right a grievance of
long standing in Harlem, the Negro
Press points out. Everyone in Harlem,
young and old, whether “holding” or
without visible means of support, plays
the numbers game or “policy.” This is
a lottery based on the figures taken
from the day’s stockmarket quotations
or racecourse betting statistics. Although

the customers are virtually all black,
the policy “bankers” or operators are
virtually all members of the Cosa
Nostra. Powell has been trying to put
these white gangsters out of this illegal
racket and supplant them with black
ones.
“Adam says we (don’t go and make
spaghetti for the Italians,” one Harlem
policy player remarked, “so why should
they run our numbers?”
It was during this popular struggle
against the entrenched white gangsters
that Representative Powell called Mrs.
James a “bag woman” in a television
interview. She sued and got a judgment
of $164,000. The legislator has not
paid one penny to date. However,
he has offered to make weekly payments
of $6O to her in a gradual reduction of
the judgment. The lawyer representing
the injured party rejected this proposal,
pointing out that his client would have
to live to the age of 121 to collect the
full amount due her. He also noted that
$6O a week did not even cover the
interest on the total sum, which would
amount to $l9O a week.
In the heat of the legal battle, Powell
seems to have lost the other battle
against the Cosa Nostra, and .white
gangsters continue to grow rich on the
pennies of the poor. But no matter.
Adam Clayton Powell remains a shin-
ing, albeit slightly tarnished, knight to
the people who really matter to him the
most, the voters of Harlem.
ON THE MARGIN
The Way of a Toad
THE procedures of love, courtship,
and marriage, as developed by
human beings, are extremely com-
plex. By contrast, there is something
appealing and even beautiful about the
more simple, direct ways of the so-
called lower animals. The thought is
not new, but it comes with unusual
poignancy to anyone who reads a recent
article in “Australian Natural His-
tory” (the admirable magazine pub-
lished by the Australian Museum, Syd-
ney) dealing with the habits of Bufo
marinus, the Queensland cane toad.
This attractive little creature feels,
during the summer months, as so many
others do, the promptings of the
tender passion. Mr. I. R. Straughan,
of the University
College of Towns-
ville, tells in the
article how at such
times cane toads of
both sexes proceed,
by mutual under-
standing, to a pool
which is used as a
breeding site. The
more enterprising
male toads adopt
an unusual mode of
travel. As Mr.
Straughan says:
“Males may clasp
females in transit
and make the jour-
ney on the back of
the females.”
What excites in-
terest is not only
the charming spontaneity of this be-
haviour, but—from a male viewpoint—
its convenience. Transport-wise, the
male sex of whatever species has surely
never had it so good. When Bufo mari-
nus would a-wooing go, there is no
fruitless hailing of taxis on a wet Friday
night. He does not even need to walk.
He is carried piggy-back by his bride-
to-be; nor does she complain, as she
hops along under her burden, that he
shows selfishness or lack of respect.
The breeding site chosen by human
beings is commonly a suburban cot-
tage or a flat but how much more
roundabout and expensive is the
method of arriving there. Before the
human male makes any suggestion of
adjourning to a breeding site, conven-
tion demands that he should escort the
female to a series of entertainment
sites. Moreover, he is expected to
provide a vehicle either his own car
or some form of public transport.
If the human male tried to take a
leaf out of the cane toad’s book and
suggested that the female carry him
piggy-back to the Theatre Royal or
the Taboo Discotheque, he would very
soon find he had another think com-
ing.
Even when the male has taken the
female to various entertainment sites,
he has no guarantee that she will
accompany him to a breeding site.
Somewhere in the evolutionary pro-
gress, if that is the right word, from
Bufo marinus to Homo sapiens, the
female has lost her candid, co-opera-
tive spirit. She is as likely as not to say
she would rather they remained “just
friends” or to put him off by some
equivocal ploy like, “Don’t ring me,
I’ll ring you.”
If the human female does agree to
accept the male as her mate, his diffi-
culties are not over. Often he has had
to spend so much on entertainment
and transport that he cannot afford the
down payment on a breeding site. Their
joint move to that spot is post-
poned to a future
date. How strange
this delay would
seem to the cane
toad and his ardent
partner, who do not
believe in long en-
gagements.
When the long-
awaited day comes
for the human pair
to occupy their
mortgaged or rented
breeding site, the
relatively subser-
vient role of the
male is again in
evidence. By custom
he picks up the
female and carries
her across the thres-
hold of the breed-
ing site—a direct contrast to the male
cane toad’s hitchhiking procedure.
Some readers may protest that
human courtship, with all its disadvan-
tages, is conducted on a higher plane
of passion than a toad’s. But Mr.
Straughan emphasises the intensity of
the male cane toad’s feelings. When
fully aroused, he says, “males will
attempt to clasp any object approxi-
mately the dimensions of a toad, in-
cluding the footwear of intruding
naturalists.” This is the very ecstasy
of love.
One can well imagine the male cane
toad’s fierce sense of triumph when he
takes up his position as a first-class
passenger on the female’s back, re-
marking: “This is the only way to
travel.” Or again, the bitterness and
frustration of the toad who finds he is
riding on the boot of a B.Sc.
It is my belief that somewhere in
most male humans there is an atavistic
envy of this creature’s uninhibited
life and, particularly, its solution of the
transport problem. In a train the other
evening I heard a young man say to
a friend: “It’s a perfect set-up. She’s
got her own car.” There for a moment,
almost audibly, one could recognise the
summer mating call of the cane toad.

WINE OF THE MONTH
Four-Number (White) Wines
Twelve
months ago,
my New
Year’s choice
(which launched
Wines of the
Month column)
was a Lindeman’s
white. Well, once
more, dear friends.
(I am not trying
to effect a tradi-
tion, but, on the
other hand, I am not trying not to.)
Last year the wine in question was
a Reserve Spatlese, and many people
told me that they were surprised I
did not start off with the famous
Lindeman’s Reserve Rieslings, an aris-
tocratic lineage, bedecked with gold
and fancy show ribbons. So it has
taken me 12 months to make up the
deficiency.
The January 1967 Wine of the Month
is Lindeman’s Reserve Riesling Bin
2955. Four letter words can be base,
four number wines are rarely so. The
four number wines of Lindeman’s,
especially the whites, are amongst the
top wines of Australia year after year.
They are not cheap. In fact, many
years ago, in my hard-headed, horse-
trading days as a wine retailer, I can
remember writing Lindeman’s a
Strong Note. I said the wines were
getting too pricy. Today we accept
the prices much more graciously. We
understand that top wines cost a great
deal of money to produce and are still
underpriced in relation to world
standards.
Back to the quality of the wines.
Max Lake, in his new book, “The
Classic Wines of Australia,” says of
this company and their Hunter whites:
“. . . they have made absolutely superb
wines, some full, some delicate, some
flinty, some light and acidy, even petil-
lant, others robust but never coarse,
and all with previously undreamed of
finesse in bouquet.”
It is not much use going back over
all the old numbers at length. There
have been famous Lindeman’s whites
for many years now. The advent of
enclosed fermentation in 1956 saw a
perhaps lighter style without the old
honey flavor which is supposedly char-
acteristic of the very full traditional
Hunter whites. Hans Mollenhauer was
the wine-maker then and Carl Stock-
hausen took over in 1960. His first
wine in that year was the 1616, a mag-
nificent bone dry, slightly acid Hunter
Riesling (known of course as Semilion
everywhere else), which won six first
prizes in its first two years of Show
life and is now winning further gold
medals as a white burgundy. This is
one of the extraordinary things about
these white wines. They are light and
delicate enough to be regarded as
hocks when they are young, even though
they are not of the true Rhine Riesling
character. In the Hock and Young Dry
White classes they win all sorts of
awards. Then as they develop age, a
fuller, deeper, softer style evolves which
does terribly well in the white bur-
gundy classes. So you can drink the
wine at both ends so to speak.
The top Riesling of 1961 was the
1760, which won two or three Golds.
1962 vintage brought forth the Bin
1930, which won many Golds and also
two championship cups; Bin 2222 was
the choice in 1963, and I can’t think
of how many hundred dozen of this
wine I sold. In 1964 Bin 2464 con-
tained a little Traminer and I thought
the wine, though good, was not of the
previous high standard. There was a
developed character on the nose
which didn’t please me. To everyone
else’s scorn, I described it as a “freshly
cut cabbage” nose, but he who laughs
last—the wine never won a Gold and
as far as I know is the only one in this
line which has never done the trick. Bin
2760 was the pick of the vintage in
1965 and this has just sold out. The
Traminer had been removed and we
were back to the Gold standard. Two
last year and no doubt more to come.
Bin 2955 is a worthy successor to all
this greatness. The grape basically
used is the Hunter Riesling or Semilion,
though this, like many of the others,
does contain some Verdelhao. The
latter grape undoubtedly does give
some depth and substance to the palate
and nose. It has a very full quality,
highly pungent strong aromatic nose
and flavor, which augments the con-
siderable finesse and balance of the
Hunter Riesling.
There is less Verdelhao in this wine,
however, than in previous wines. In
1966 Lindeman’s decided to make both
a Traminer Riesling Bin 2945 and a
Verdelhao Riesling Bin 2965. However,
it is not entirely possible in the Linde-
man’s vineyards to separate all the
grapes, since most of the white vine-
yards are of the “fruit salad” variety,
containing vines of different grapes. .
Undoubtedly in much of this type
consistent quality is the result of fine
wine-making. Lindeman’s pay a great
deal of attention to the handling of
the fruit and material; they go to
fanatical lengths to preclude any possi-
bility of oxidisation. One of the results
of this is the famous Lindeman’s color,
a brilliant green-gold. Another reason
for this color is the surrounding soil
structure. The Bush Vineyard, part of
Coolalta at the back of Ben Ean, pro-
duces wine of a quite remarkable green
color. The wine is of the very highest
standard and is always used in these
top reserve whites.
So, my first recommendation of the
year, a wine that has something of the
mystique that lives in all good wine,
2955, a result of fine wine-making, soil
structure, a top area, and a bit of
“fruit salad.”

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
A Monstrous Legion
By ELWYN LYNN
THE nude, hiding almost nothing, has
been a barometer of moral and
artistic pressures: angular,
anguished, and piteously vulnerable in
Bosch’s “Hell,” she grows voluptuous in
Rubens’ celebrations of fleshy exuber-
ance; an Egyptian nude of 3000 B.C.
looks like a mathematician’s rigid fetish,
and prehistoric Venuses, in whom
bulbous breast, belly, and buttock vie
for dominance, were both larder and
incubator. Whoever called them Venuses
practised the same irony as Picasso, who
named his piece of sculpture, composed
mainly of a gas stove, “La Venus du
gaz.”
In the Middle Ages, Eve, sickly, stiff,
and frigid, was the permissible nude,
but in the Renaissance the nude was a
pagan Venus; if Titian’s lie about in
patient, complacent expectancy, Durer’s
“Eve,” it has been said, is a Valkyrie
with some Venetian polish; Cranach’s
have a curiously delicate coldness what-
ever allegorical oddity, from murder to
posing with Cupid, occupies them.
Hypocrisy made the nineteenth-
century salons harems swarming with
nudes illustrating myths and history;
lolling like soft balloons, they titillated
the Victorian connoisseur, who felt guilt-
less only when his nude fetishes were
dressed in a respectable literary aura.
Still, the nude has been used in peculiar
artistic ways: to decorate Michelangelo’s
tombs of Lorenzo and Guiliano de’
Medici; and on Pilon’s tomb lie almost
naked effigies of Henry II and
Catherine de Medicis.
Manet’s 1863 “Picnic on the
Grass” (is it more euphemistic to call
it, as the art books do, “Le Dejeuner
sur l’Herbe”?), when clothed men
shared lunch with naked women and
didn’t pretend they were up to mytho-
logical or historical high jinks, the nude
adopted roles like an omnivorous
actress: bather, Venus, Amazon, courte-
san, Odalisque, lesbian, noble savage,
ignoble prostitute, looking elegantly
spiritual with Modigliani and languor-
ously sensual with Gauguin; Grom-
aire’s are muscularly cubist; Delvaux’s
surreal nudes, pallid and moonlit, are
somnambulists whom no Peeping Tom
can claim; Picasso’s are wide awake
and can present breast, buttocks, back,
and front simultaneously. Indeed, all
artistic tastes seem catered for; Schiele
made an erocticism of emaciation, and
Matisse rendered the nude as an
asexual, undemanding decoration (no
doubt part of his notion of art for the
tired businessman), and Bonnard made
her the consumer’s delight; delicately
tinted as a peach, ripe and ready to
fall off the tree.
The Australian nude for a long time
was not comfortable in rough terrain
and on our tough grasses; puritanism
confined her, bathing in the open sea
was forbidden until 1902, and when
Syd Long, in 1894, painted some naked
bathers in the distance and the National
Art Gallery of N.S.W. bought it, ques-
tions were asked in the Legislative As-
sembly; Roberts, in a utopian view of
Australian life, hid most of his boy
bather in “Sunny South” behind trees.
The barrier was broken finally not so
much by Norman Lindsay’s legions of
great-breasted, huge-thighed, pouting,
sleepy-eyed nudes as by his theories of
the nude as natural epitome of animal
health and vitality. He used her as
ammunition against the sexual prohibi-
tions of puritanical Christianity and
plain wowserism.
In his “Pollice Verso” of 1904 a
Dionysian, naked mob abhors the cruci-
fixion, and though it was bought by the
Melbourne National Gallery it was
hung face to the wall in the exhibition
from which it was purchased. In Novem-
ber, 1965, the nude and her scattered
parts were again turned to the wall at
Sydney’s Gallery A, but generally,
timid, brazen, decorative, or banal, she
has, since Lindsay, immodestly con-
fronted an unblushing public. She
hasn’t been at it for long in Australia,
for all but two of the forty nudes in
Gallery A survey in May, 1966, were
recent paintings. (All the illustrations,
except the Drysdale, are from that
exhibition.)
She was rendered variously as the
essence of significant form or as a cavor-
ting satire on the nude itself in Mike
Brown’s “Mary Lou,” a painting with-
drawn under pressure from the 1964-
1965 show that toured Australia and
Europe; she later caused no corruption
and depravity when shown in Mel-
bourne in 1964, and why should she,
for she is merely a burlesque of mid-
century substitutes: plastic and pin-ups.
With real baby doll arms, plastic ducks
for breasts and plastic guitars for thighs,
she is worshipped by an array of cut-
out beauties straining in momentary
erotic poses. Vulgar in itself, it lam-
poons the vulgarisation of the nude
as girlie-mag tease.
Drysdale’s aims are not so different;
he wants to rehabilitate the Aborigine
from despised nakedness to comely
nudity, and though he resorts to over-
familiar contours and pose he does
capture a haunting, tired loneliness and
her passivity accords with his view of
the native as noble, dispossessed outcast.
Norman Lindsay’s half-nude is far
from passive and is vulgar to no pur-
pose; she has more refined vulgarity in
her arched little finger than Brown’s
nudes possess in their whole bodies. Her
sullen, defiant gaze, which is really nar-
cissism pretending to be invitation, is a
parody of the romanticist’s vampire
woman. Perhaps it is better to catch
them asleep, as do Arthur Murch and
Jeff Smart. Murch’s palpitates and glows
opalescently against the rocks; classi-
cally and neutrally disposed, she is no
more sensual than Smart’s leathery
narcissist, whose flesh is no more pliant
than the subtly arranged buildings be-
hind her.
Fleshiness of flesh has little appeal to-
the modern paipter; the flesh of John
Brack’s send-up of Boucher’s powder-
puff, adolescent layabouts is like dry,,
pale green cheese, with cannon balls
for buttocks; if the hard linearism in-
trigues, the angular boniness is daunting-
Charles Blackman invests his pale, inert
silhouette with tenderness; his unfleshy
figure is naked truth and innocence as
natural and virginal as the flowers that
accompany her.
JT is surprising that such simplicity
and gentleness escapes insipidity; but
it is a tame vapidity that Michael
Shaw courts in his blank-faced, blank-
minded girl, leading men to make a
welcome of indifference. He is a
truer Pop artist than Brown or
Boileau because he borrows directly
from the flat, undifferentiated areas
of advertisements and catches the
inertia of the additive girls in cigarette
or automobile advertisements.
Francis Lymburner’s pink-grey girl
is not indifferent; she’s just tired and
debilitated, the blue around her eyes
matching that of her blue stockings;
no blue stocking herself, she is the
epitome of the jaded chorus girl, only
the large, whirling pink nipples show-
ing signs of life.
Andrew Sibley’s wayward girl pro-
liferates uncertainly breast and buttock
forms in a kind of ecstatic accumula-
tion of secondary erotic zones; she
seems unable to make up her mind
what to emphasise. It suggests dis-
orientated mindlessness.
There is always a mind, a person-
ality about in a Dobell; the heavy
density of flesh embodies a real human
spirit; his nude is no satirical or
mythical stalking horse, no symbol of
languor or fruity enticement, but a
being carrying out a common, natural
process with a deliberation and finality
that one finds in Rembrandt.
Of course, there are many other
attitudes to the nude in Australia not
illustrated here. Noel Counihan sees
her as the embodiment of either belea-
gured proletarian protest or, if you wish,
socialist realist dogma; Larter’s droop
with flaccid flesh, Molvig’s are tossed
in whirlpools of paint or leap like
transparent Praying Mantises; Reinhard
specialises in the frigid ghosts of women
who are covered with cliche contours;
Reddington’s androgynous, almost am-
phorous nudes melt into fluent paint;
Frater used to seek a still objectivity as
though a nude were an apple or pump-
kin; Godfrey Miller sees her as the

MELBOURNE THEATRE, 1966
Rewarding the Faithful
By PHILLIP ADAMS
IN recent years the appearance of
numbers of people in the foyers of
Melbourne’s theatres was almost
as mysterious a phenomenon as the
legendary massing of the lemmings,
in that most groups seemed compul-
sively motivated and faced a decidedly
gloomy future. For good plays had long
since disappeared from the stages of
the Princess and JCW theatres, and
the Reps seemed strangely enfeebled.
But in 1966 the patience of theatre’s
faithful was rewarded, and in their
sadly depleted numbers they were able
to enjoy a modicum of reasonable
material, and even a smidgin of ex-
cellence.
But we must check ourselves in this
reckless outpouring of praise and give
some statistics. In ’66 it was possible
to spend 160 hours or seven days in
the professional theatre, which I did.
(This figure excludes opera and ballet,
which are the province of THE BUL-
LETIN’S song-and-dance man, Mr.
Cargher). Of those hours, 49 were
all-Australian, but before this is inter-
preted as evidence of a renaissance, it
must be pointed out that after remov-
ing the duration of the revues, pan-
tomimes and (shudder) old-time melo-
dramas, we’re down to a fleeting 21.
And if you skim off the comedies and
other frivolous works, you’ve got 15
hours of straight drama; five local
plays which were in any way serious-
minded.
We had the not-very musical version
of Dick’s “Bunch of Ratbags,” and our
first theological thriller in “The Cell”
by Robert Wales. Alan Hopgood struck
a serious pose with “Yuk,” adding to-
gether all the contending views on
Vietnam and subtracting his own, so
that once you took yourself away you
were left with the opinion you first
thought of. In a busy year, David
Martin published two novels and dram-
atised a third—his strongly written
“The Young Wife,” which restated the
Othello theme in Melbourne’s Greek
community. And we musn’t forget, no
matter how hard we try, the play in
which Googie withered, the disastrous
“Desire of the Moth.”
The Carrolls and JCW can put ’66
down as another year of useful market
research, in that their programs estab-
lished fairly clearly what the public
doesn’t want to see. Second-rate musi-
cals and comedies, for instance. St.
Martins and Emerald Hill continue to
parody each other, in that the Hill
strives to be avant-garde and starves
for audiences, while St. Martins
is so well patronised it doesn t dare
experiment. When Wal Cherry got his
profosordup, I suggested to him that
St. Martins might be interested in
taking over Emerald Hill, as it could
give them the opportunity they need to
break new ground. Just as they did
some years ago, with a brilliant pro-
duction of “The Caretaker” at Russell
Street. Apparently St. Martins was
interested, but couldn’t afford it. Now
the Hill has been given a reprieve
under the new actor-management of
George Whaley and Robin Ramsay.
While both these theatres had their
moments in ’66, it was clearly the
Union Rep’s big year. “The Represerita-
tive,” “War and Peace,” and “The
Royal Hunt of the Sun” were am-
bitious, expensive, and commendable
productions. Yet the highlight of the
year wasn’t one of these Cinerama
offerings, but a little black-and-white
production called “The Knack.”
Probably the best way to review a
year’s theatre —all 160 hours —is to let
the most vivid memories percolate. For
example, George Whaley’s Pope Pius,
a performance in which characterisation
and caricature were balanced on a
fine intelligence. Jacqueline Kott’s un-
derstanding of Josie’s protective self-
depreciation in “Moon for the Misbe-
gotten.” Sean Kenny’s set for “Oliver”
in which derelict stairways stumbled
over each other, and Kristian Fredrik-
son’s giant icon which opened on Tol-
stoi’s Russia. Ann Charleston’s sudden
rage at her poverty in Anouilh’s “The
Cavern.” Brian Jamfes and Margaret
Millar achieving small miracles in
minor roles in “War and Peace.” Paul
Karo blending Stan Laurel with Ringo
Starr for his lead role in “A Lily in
Little India.” Bunney Brook’s slap-
happy but splendid performance as the
lesbian actress in “Sister George.” Keith
Davies as the shy murderer in “The
Creeper.” The feeling of excitement
after “Macbeth in Camera” —< despite
one’s irritation with the mannerisms of
Harold Lang. The first-class work of
Dennis Olsen and Gordon MacDougall
in “Night of the Ding-Dong”—and the
way Jennifer Hagan brought the house
down every time she lisped “yuss.”
Brian Young’s hilarious strivings after
roosterhood in Carlino’s “Epiphany,”
and a moment in “Royal Hunt” when
a great red cloth billowing over a stage
massacre prompted a deafening “bloody
marvellous” frord a deeply moved
patron.
There are, of course, less pleasant
memories. There’s something about an
inadequate actor that makes the seat
harder and interval remote, and hell
is a bad production of a worse play.
But as a critic one can exact a public
vengeance. And anyway, the seats, no
matter how hard, are free.
SYDNEY THEATRE, 1966
No Bulk in Drama Diet
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
PURELY by coincidence I reviewed
66 theatrical productions in 1966.
This figure shows that there is
plenty of theatrical activity going on
in Sydney. An avid theatregoer could
attend at least one new production
every week. But, having attended these
productions myself, I must confess that
a lot of them were very dreary. Also,
many were very poorly attended.
As a small check on this I con-
ducted a poll among nine men and
women with whom I had lunch on
Boxing Day. Their total of visits
to the theatre was 40, which makes an
average of 4.5 visits each. This means
that they went to the theatre, on an
average, about once every three months.
They were rather apologetic about this
and started murmuring that they had
gone more often in other years. This
may be so, because 1966 was a dull
year in the theatre. However, I think
people should not feel obliged to
apologise for not going to the theatre.
This makes it sound like a chore. It
would be better if they took an aggres-
sive attitude and started complaining
that the theatre is not exciting enough
for them.
The people who should worry are
theatre managements: it is their prob-
lem to entice people to the theatre
once a month instead of once in three
months. Of course, there is not just
one kind of theatre nor one kind of
audience, but a number of different
kinds. A theatre must decide what kind
of audience it is trying to attract
and choose its plays accordingly. Which
brings me to my chief criticism of
Sydney theatres in 1966: bad choice
of plays leading to small audiences
and heavy gloom.
But first let us look at the successes.
Of six productions which I consider


the best, the blue ribbon goes to Robert
Quentin’s production of the Old Tote
Company in Chekov’s “Three Sisters.”
It was a good production of a great
play by a strong company. Also at the
Old Tote were two farcical comedies:
John Tasker’s production of the visit-
ing South Australian Theatre Company
in “The Night of the Ding-Dong,” by
Australian playwright Ralph Peterson,
and Alan Edwards’ production of the
second-year NIDA students in Pinero’s
“The Schoolmistress.” (This is to be
repeated early in 1967.)
The “Q” Theatre was responsible for
two more of my top six in its lunch-
hour productions: Peter O’Shaugh-
nessy’s impersonation of Bernard Shaw
in “Bernard Shaw On Love and War”
and Jim Sharman’s production of “The
Lover,” by Harold Pinter. The sixth
is “The Death of Bessie Smith,” by
Edward Albee, produced by Fred Sims
at the Wayside Chapel. Also a lunch-
hour production, this was presented by
a new group calling themselves the
Encircle Company, made up of stud-
ents and actors from the Ensemble
Theatre.
The actor of the year was un-
doubtedly Peter O’Shaughnessy for his
impersonation of Bernard Shaw and his
performance as Dylan Thomas in
“Dylan” at the Independent. Indeed,
Peter O’Shaughnessy’s ability to attract
remarkably good audiences suggests
that Little Theatre audiences will fol-
low a “star” if they have the oppor-
tunity.
Other outstanding performances were
those of Stewart Ginn as the wild Irish
father in “Moon for the Misbegotten,”
Jennifer Wright and James Condon in
“Aspects of Love,” Max Meldrum in
“The Lover,” Max Cullen as the Negro
in “The Death of Bessie Smith,” and
Mark McManus in “Luv.” Outstand-
ing among young actors were Martin
Harris in the Jane Street season, Jen-
nifer Cullen in “The Sport of My Mad
Mother,” and Helen Morse and Judith
Fisher in “Twelfth Night” on ABC
television.
As well as the six productions men-
tioned, there were 28 more that had
some merit, varying from much to
little, and a further 25 that I regard
as likely to have put people off going to
the theatre for ever. Of this 25, which
is more than a third of the total, some
were badly done and some were not
worth doing at all.
I wish theatrical managements would
make a resolution for 1967: to go none
of the way with Broadway. Broad-
way’s contribution for 1966 was: “The
Subject was Roses,” “A Thousand
Clowns,” “Burning Bright,” “A Far
Country,” “Bachelor Girls,” “Where’s
Daddy?” and “The Odd Couple.” All
these I could cheerfully have done
without.
Lest I be suspected of anti-American
prejudice, here is my list of expendable
English plays: “A Sleep of Prisoners,”
“The Killing of Sister George,” “Five
Finger Exercise,” and “The Firstborn.”
But, to strike a more cheerful note,
there was one exciting development in
1966: the experimental season of new
Australian plays at the Jane Street
Theatre. Like so many good things in
our theatre (the Old Tote, NIDA)
this season was sponsored by the Uni-
versity of N.S.W. Drama Foundation,
with the aid of a grant from the Gul-
benkian Foundation. What 'tvas the im-
portance of the Jane Street venture?
First, it was a workshop in which the
writers worked together with the actors
and producers, reshaping their plays
in rehearsal. Since they were all new
dramatists, this was very important.
Second, the producers (Robin Lovejoy
and Alexander Hay) say that the audL
ences were' much more responsive to
these plays than they usually are in
the theatre. Third, the short, crowded
season gave the mainly young company
the kind of intensive training that is
afforded by repertory work in Eng-
land. Fourth, there was an atmosphere
of rare excitement, enthusiasm, and
dedication associated with this experi-
ment which was very encouraging.
With Jane Street in existence and
a total of 15 Australian plays perform-
ed in 1966 in our various theatres, local
drama seems to be reasonably well off.
Our major outstanding problem is the
classical drama, including Shakespeare.
This year we had “Romeo and Julief”
at the Community Theatre and “Ham-
let” at the Cell Block Theatre. I
thought both made Shakespeare seem
boring. The only lively production was
Ken Hannam’s “Twelfth Night” on
ABC television.
There is a strong and urgent need
for the subsidisation of productions of
classical plays.
ART
Visiting the Oases
THE Christmas holidays used to be
an artistic desert with a late Janu-
ary oasis usually a mirage of
the Archibald, Wynne, and Sulman to
remind holidaymakers, surfeited with
city and sea, that the Art Gallery of
N.S.W. existed; now the commercial
galleries, which have in many ways
taken the initiative from the State gal-
leries, have changed their, policies to
net some art-lovers from the vast shoals
of vacationers.
Rudy Komon, with an excellent col-
lection of works by significant and
famed artists, will remain open through
January; the El Dorado, which is cele-
brating the contributions of local Lithu-
anian artists (the Lithuanian com-
munity is about to print a book,
“Eleven Lithuanian Artists in Aus-
tralia”), was open until January 7; the
Central Street Gallery reopens on
January 10 with works on paper by six
locals, two Londoners, and five Ameri-
cans, all devotees of the simple image
whether geometrical or pop.
Most ambitious is Gallery A in Syd-
ney and Melbourne; both galleries are
showing different works by the same
artists; works will be changed at three-
weekly intervals and alternate between
the galleries. In this way 236 works
by 75 artists will be shown, and as an
aide-memoire there is an excellent
illustrated catalogue.
Apart from commercial considera-
tions, there are several reasons why this
has occurred; a gallery has to do more
than show its painters every year or
18 months, and in between sell from
the backroom. It needs to keep its
artists before the buying eye by mixed
shows such as that at Komon’s; it is a
way, too, of introducing a new painter
in a most testing manner: by displaying
his work in this case Marmol’s
among established artists.
The regular visitor can learn, too;
if he was quick enough to catch
Stern’s he could compare Eric Smith’s
“Ecce Homo,” tattered, crumbly, ex-
pressively slashed in black, of 1958,.
with his “Homage to Picasso” of 1966,
where the master, accompanied by
stencils of “Picasso” and Picasso’s signa-
ture, stares from one window set in
abstract squares. At Stern’s he could
have seen Donald Friend’s Martians
landing in a sphere out of Bosch and
at A, Friend’s penchant for parody, has
a bird, in Melanesian primitive style,
pecking at a collage of an Opera
House Lottery ticket. Drysdale’s col-
lection of eroded, surreal rocks at
Stern’s makes one ask if he has not
become too opulently fruity with his
heap of crimson hills at Komon’s. Dick-
erson at A has haunted children whose
inner-city environment is a jail; at
Komon’s, four haunting Dickersonian
people look as though they have
emerged from imprisdnment in the
depths of the forest behind them; they
are “Waiting for the Picture Bus,” no
doubt driven by Kafka.
There are two beautiful drawings by
Len French, at Komon’s and A; both
are in his stained, smudged manner,
that at Komon’s contrasting severity
of spare form with casual calligraphy,
and that at A, looking almost bruised
and about to break into flower.
At both these galleries is new,
luminously subdued work by Judy
Cassab, who has opted for a soft-edged
impaction of slaty rock forms: but there
are too many to deal with here; at A,
one might ask is a rabid expressionist
like Whisson so different from Olsen in
“Animal Landscape”; at Komon’s,
doesn’t Passmore’s early “Pear Tree,”
despite Cezanne, share the expres-
sionism of Molvig’s whirpool called
“Twilight of Women”?
Ironically, just as galleries in N.S.W.
are opening longer, Richard Larter, in
a letter to the Contemporary Art
Society, has called upon all artists to
do what he intends to do as a protest
against the sentence imposed upon
Michael Brown: not to exhibit in
N.S.W. in 1967.
The other extreme, equally com-
mendable, could be Nudes Only for
1967.

BOOKS
Vincent Buckley’s Faith
By RODNEY HALL
Arcady and Other Places. Vincent
Buckley. Melbourne University Press.
$2.
VINCENT BUCKLEY has exer-
cised an important influence on re-
fcent poetry in this country, first as
a critic, then as a poet. This fact alone
is interesting because his volume of
criticism “Essays in Poetry, Mainly
Australian” was not published until
1957, whereas his first collection of
poems, “The World’s Flesh,” appeared
in 1955. His theory, then, seemed more
in tune with new developments than
his practice. His second collection of
poems, “Masters in Israel,” was issued
in 1961. This was the year he began
editing the poetry page of THE BUL-
LETIN and his chief influence outside
Melbourne became editorial rather than
critical. It remained so until the appear-
ance of his set of “Eleven Political
Poems” in the magazine “Prospect.” Al-
though a few poets of the rising genera-
tion had already published comparable
political poems, these established a tone
of voice which was to have a widespread
effect during the next few years, and
which was radically different from the
fruity abstruse language of his early
work.
•pHE “Eleven Political Poems” are in-
cluded in the present volume,
“Arcady and Other Places.” They
explore Vincent Buckley’s concern with
public issues, using a lucid vocabulary,
both of words and ideas, that might well
attract minds otherwise totally shut to
poetry.
While I, personally, find the author’s
views somewhat repugnant, the intelli-
gence of their argument and their struc-
tural adroitness command respect. Even
though they amount to an acceptance
of the status quo in an acquisitive
society, it is not a complacent accep-
tance. Indeed, it is almost acceptance by
default —depending on the absence of
social vices here that he sees in
alternative societies.
The most direct successes of the poli-
tical sequence are “Return of a Popular
Statesman” and “Secret Policeman.”
“No New Thing” is particularly strong,
too, with its synthesis of individuals
achieved through anger:
The clerks who rubber-stamp our
deaths,
Executors of death’s estate;
Poets who count their dying breaths;
Lovers who pledge undying hate;
The self-made and the self-ruined
men;
The envious with the strength of ten.
The last of the “Eleven Political
Poems” is an attempt to rise to a hope-
ful note, an affirmation of faith. Inter-
estingly enough, this is not faith in man,
nor even in God through men, but in
God through individual conviction,
almost a denial of political solution.
The influences of Roman Catholicism
and of Ireland are very strong through-
out this book. Both are treated with
affectionate lightheartedness in “Puritan
Poet Reel.” But their effect is most in-
sistent when Buckley deals with his
serious themes of pain, death, and ritual.
Now if I’m to impersonalise this
death
I must fight through these to some
abstract symbol . . .
Yet his abstract symbols, by and
large, seem to me to require a special
kind of response in the reader. Perhaps
—consciously or unconsciously—he is
writing for fellow-Catholics. Certainly
he accepts the aim of abstraction as
something he has no need to justify.
For the layman, many of the poems in
this book may seem to decline from
precise statement to metaphysical dif-
fuseness. Only when the religious idea
reflects back the physical reality with
renewed strength does it strike me as
an enrichment of the poetry, as with
the close of the sequence “Stroke.”
All seven of these linked poems have
superb endings. They seem to break
free from an imposed detachment, from
deliberately rubato rhythms, to a final
statement firm in its movement and of
deep consequence.
Mention should also be made of
Vincent Buckley
“Lament For the Makers,” a poem
which has been printed several times
before. It has been almost totally re-
written. And the result is interesting.
Although the old version had much to
offer, the new version gains in elegiac
dignity. He has transcended the acade-
mic in himself and, instead of listing
notable poets in a sort of potted review
(clever as it was), he fuses them.
There are some impressive poems in
“Arcady and Other Places.” Despite
the anarchic rhythm of many lines, his
tone of voice is fairly consistent through-
out —an intelligent, analytical contem-
plation. The book is beautifully pro-
duced, and seems to have been pub-
lished without the assistance of the
Commonwealth Literary Fund ... a
curious fact, it surely could not have
been rejected by them.

In this case father really did know
best. Now, 34 years later, the first of
five massive volumes of biography (ac-
companied by five companion volumes
of documents) rolls off the press, the
latest and potentially the most impor-
tant contribution to the mammoth
Churchill industry since Sir Winston’s
own war history.
The task of assembling his father’s


life must have been a frightening
challenge to the world’s oldest enfant
terrible: the contrast between the sub-
ject’s success and adulation and the
author’s frustrations and bizarre fail-
ures was so pointed; the risks so great
that too much filial piety and senti-
mentality (and the Churchills are a
notably sentimental clan) would des-
troy its value and make it easy prey
to predatory reviewers.
It must be said at once that he
has assembled (aided by a numerous
staff fifteen names are acknow-
ledged) a masterly first volume, based
on Lockhart’s maxim in writing Scott’s
life, “He shall be his own biographer.”
If the remaining volumes show the
same restraint and objectivity (and
he keeps the same research team),
Randolph Churchill has his chance of
a place in the sun.
JJAVING once seen Churchill plain
in extreme old age, with only a
flicker of life in the glum white face,
and barely the energy to stump into the
Commons leaning heavily on his stick,
too deaf to hear the debates, it seems
hard to think of him ever being
young, but his helplessness and vulner-
ability immediately spring to mind.
Churchill’s own “My Early Life”
is quoted extensively throughout the
new book, but mostly to note its in-
adequacy. Churchill exaggerated his
stupidity at school, minimised the ex-
treme heartlessness of his parents, and
romanticised his youthful military
achievements.
The early letters are pathetic, with
his boyish love and eager requests met
by a “remarkable . . . neglect and
lack of interest, even by Victorian
standards,” with a vain father poised
for the political triumph which never
came, destined to die of GPI, and a
beautiful, wildly extravagant American
mother who squandered Lord Ran-
dolph’s modest estate and made her son
literally a hostage to fortune.
He hated the cruelty of his first
school, St. George’s, Ascot, and was
flogged when he kicked the Head-
Winston Churchill
as a young man.
master’s “sacred straw hat” to pieces.
Winston’s brother Jack, aged three,
told a visitor that he was trying to
be good “but brother is teaching me
to be naughty.” At ten, transferred to
a dame school at Brighton, he was
taught science (but presumably not
spelling): “Is it not wonderful to
think that water is made of two gases
namely hydrodgen and nitrodgen. I
like it, only it seems funny that two
gases should make water. With love
and kisses.” On second thoughts, per-
haps he learnt little science, either.
Even when he yearly died of pneu-
monia at Brighton in 1886, neither
parent could spare the time to visit him.
His “passionate desire to learn to play
the ’cello” was thwarted and for months
he had to beg for visits, money, and
autographs for swapping. He warned his
mother that unless he could come to
London for the Jubilee and to see
“Buffalow Bill,” “I shall be disappointed,
disappointed is not the word I shall be
miserable, after you have promised me,
and all, I shall never trust your promises
again. But I know that Mummy loves
her Winny much too much for that.”
At Harrow, while chided for “pheno-
menal slovenliness” and “habitual neg-
ligence,” he succeeded at last and, in
December, 1890, announced that he had
passed in all subjects. He brooded about
entering the Church, leading Randolph
to speculate that if he had found the
C. of E. too small he might have
crossed to Rome and reshaped the face
of Christendom as Pope Hadrian VII.
In fact, Winston only took Communion
once in his life.
True, it took him three tries to pass
the Sandhurst entrance exam, and then
with the aid of Captain James’ famous
crammer’s college, but the exams were
really stiff and less than a quarter passed
the quota at each attempt. He did well
in every subject but Latin and Chemis-
try. Nevertheless, his father was still
displeased and warned that he might
“degenerate into a shabby, unhappy and
futile existence” (August 1893). Win-
ston complained to his mother, “it is
no use my trying to explain to Papa,
and I suppose I shall go on being
treated as ‘that boy’ till I am 50 years
old.” “Oh! Winny,” wrote Lady Ran-
dolph, “what a harum-scarum fellow
you are! You must really give up being
childish.”
When Lord Randolph died in
January, 1895, Winston was forced to
grow up quickly.
His army colleagues apparently dis-
liked him and he took the first of his
many libel actions against charges of
turf malpractice and “gross immorality
of the Oscar Wilde type,” winning them
both.
JOURNALISM and Service life ap-
pealed to him only as qualifications
for politics. In 1895, commissioned by
the “Daily Graphic,” he sailed for New
York and met Bourke Cockran, an Irish-
born lawyer and Democrat Congressman
(Adlai Stevenson’s uncle), who was the
acknowledged inspiration for his later
oratory, then observed the civil war in
Cuba as an attache on the staff of the
Spanish General Valdes.
This was the first of his many wars.
In India he served in the Malakand
Field Force, the subject of his first
book (1898), read omnivorously (Mac-
aulay, Gibbon, Adam Smith, Pascal, 27
volumes of the “Annual Register,”
Plato’s “Republic”) and composed his
first lengthy political reveries. He also
met “the first great love of his life,”
Miss Pamela Plowden, now the Dowager
Countess of Lytton, and still alive at
92.
In the ambiguous roles of army
officer-war correspondent he landed
himself on Kitchener in 1898 for the
reconquest of the Sudan and fought
gallantly at Omdurman. Denounced as
a medal-chaser (newspapers suggested
that he deserved the VC), he was
aggrieved never to receive any military
decoration, probably as a result of the
jealousy he aroused. He complained,
uncharacteristically for a romantic, that
The Cool Apostles
Saints? Yes, of course, in that they did not care
For the parade, stability or welcome:
Came and went as they chose, used air
Freely as passport from kingdom to kingdom
Nor even observed the rules of the republic
Of letters: were not concerned if they solved
No problems of the hungry and the frantic
Asking them alms. Believing but not involved
Feeling life fluid, and time a wave that moved over
Inexorably cautious, certain only of laughter:
The instinctive patterns they chose; hunter or lover.
Twenty-four feet cavort in the smiling water.
LOUIS JOHNSON


Egypt was starved of water because
the temple of Philae stood in the way
of enlarging a dam, “the most cruel,
most wicked, and most senseless sacri-
fice ever offered on the altar of a false
religion,” and all because of the outcry
raised by archaeologists, “profitless chip-
pers of stone, rummagers in the dust-
heaps of the past.”
When Lady Randolph planned a
super-patriotic journal, “The Anglo-
Saxon,” he warned, “Patriotism and art
mix as little as oil and water,” and it
soon failed, leaving mother and son in
deep water financially. Already in
scrapes with Cox’s Bank over bouncing
cheques, he was horrified when she
borrowed £17,000 on the strength of an
insurance policy taken out on his life,
without his consent, and for which he
had to find a yearly premium of £7OO.
“Speaking quite frankly on the subject
—there is no doubt that we are both you
and I equally thoughtless—spendthrift
and extravagant.”
He set off for the Boer War in Octo-
ber, 1899, with 60 bottles of wine and
whisky, and was captured by the Boers
in November. Winston insisted that
Botha took him personally—Randolph
is at some pains to destroy the fable. He
urges that his father did not break
parole in his ingenious escape, noting
his life-long admiration for the Boers.
As the book ends, Winston, a newly
elected Conservative MP, is lecturing
in Winnipeg when he hears the news of
the old Queen’s death.
But how will the story end? Will
Winston attain his ambitions? Will he
be PM? Will he marry Miss Plowden?
We shall have to wait for the next grip-
ping instalments to find out.
Towards a New Novel
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Moderato Cantabile. Marguerite Duras.
Calder and Boyars. $3.50.
The Erasers. Alain Robbe-Grillet.
Calder and Boyars. $5.
BOTH these authors belong to the
contemporary French school of the
Nouveau Roman, the first pioneer-
ing examples of which, “Tropisms,”
passed almost unnoticed when they were
published in 1939 by the school’s mat-
riarch, Nathalie Sarraute (who, how-
ever, achieved full recognition overseas
with her superb later works, “Mar-
treerau,” “Planetarium,” and “Golden
Fruits”). In this country, owing to
some curious quirk of fashion, we have
still not caught up with this most im-
portant set of trend establishers. Indeed,
the name Sarraute is for many readers
connected only with some jealous aside
penned about her work by professional
rivals like Simone de Beauvoir. Alain
Robbe-Grillet is probably best known
for his film-scrips “Last Year at
Marienbad” and Marguerite Duras for
“Hiroshima Mon Amour” which
“Moderato Cantabile” did not achieve
an English publication until it was
filmed by Peter Brook.
Nathalie Sarraute has indicated in
her essays, Flaubert and Proust were
already pointing toward the Nouveau
Roman —Flaubert when he admitted,
“La Bovary c’est moi” and Proust when
he called “new” the fact that “Not
once does one of my characters shut
a window, wash his hands, put on his
overcoat, utter a phrase of introduction
. . .” Briefly, straight narrative is out —
the aim of the New Novel is to probe
in depth into the motivation of emo-
tional whirlpools. There is no formal
plot and even the characters remain
shadowy because they are deliberately
stripped of all conventional varnish.
The Nouveau Roman is close to the
subconscious nightscapes of poetry:
moments are snatched out of context
and subjected to the radiations of a
keenly piercing light. The New Novel is
to the Old what modern art is to
photography, and to be properly under-
stood demands the same sort of active
participation by the reader.
The main figure of “Moderato Can-
tabile” is in many ways a modern
Bovary . . . “she is every unfulfilled
female, perhaps even the projection of
the unfulfilled desires in everyone, male
and female. As some find consolation
in a vicarious existence in other people’s
worlds, drugging themselves on news-
paper-sex or TV gore, Anne Desbares-
des becomes stimulated by a partly
witnessed “crime passionel” committed
in a nearby dockyard cafe while her
small son is having a reluctant piano-
lesson above. All the unrecognised long-
ing of her ten years of model-wifery
to a leading industrialist in a provincial
waterfront town is unleashed by the
sight of the unknown murderer ten-
derly kissing the woman he has just
killed.
Every day Anne returns to the cafe,
where she encourages a mysterious out-
of-workman who had seen the murder to
discuss the crime with her. In a single
week she drowns slowly in passion by
proxy, her whole social structure disin-
tegrates, she drifts into a realm of the
sense in which she and the workman
become vaguely identified with the
other couple. On the seventh night she
returns very late, drunk, ill-groomed to
her still waiting dinner-guests.
Marguerite Duras’ technique differs
from her confreres by its deliberate
child-like simplicity of style. She uses
conversation as liberally as Sarraute,
but unlike the latter has not rejected
the old “he said, she said” device
altogether. Some of the writing appears
so elementary that grammatically it
could be a school primer: “In front
of a certain window on the first floor,”
he said, “there’s a beech tree, one of
the most beautiful trees in the garden.”
“That’s my room. It’s a big room . . .”
“They say it’s a quiet room, the best
room in the house!” Yet with these
estate-agent-like remarks, with these
bare bones of words, cunningly chosen,
built up into unmistakable shapes, the
reader is subtly made to feel that
through them the man is trying to
make love to the woman, and succeed-
ing. This is typical of how Duras trun-
cates an idea until she has whittled it
down to a single, blunt statement,
slanted exactly so that the acutest
angles show. “Moderato Cantabile” is
a magnificently written novel and the
excellent translation by Richard Seaver
reads like an original.
“The Erasers” was Robbe-Grillet’s
first published book (Paris, 1953) and
I personally prefer it to his more ex-
treme later works which have already
been published in English because it
does not yet deal so obsessively with
maddening compulsions with numbers,
mazes, and the arrangement of objects.
'JHE first clue that “The Erasers” is
much more than a superior whodunit
is the Sophocles quotation “Time that
sees all has found you out against your
will.” Wallas, the central character,
is a detective on a special mission to
investigate one of a series of political
murders that have been taking place
nightly at 7.30 somewhere in France.
There is a sense of inevitability . . .
detective, murderer and victim seem
fatalistically linked from the beginning
as if on a timeless treadmill from which
there is no escape. They revolve about
each other like bits of cork on the
eddies of the town canals. Gradually
it becomes clear to the reader that
the crime the detective has come to
investigate has, owing to an accident,
not yet been committed.
The full significance of the Sophocles
text only becomes clear toward the
end of the novel when the murder is
finally done —fry the detective himself.
For Wallas is another Oedipus and the
victim is his unknown father, and man
is destined to go on killing his father
through his own blindness. This crime
has happened before and will happen
again, every day, in every country, in
every century.
With this key, the incomprehensible
bits of the book suddenly fall into place
—the brief flashbacks to childhood, the
sensation of “having been here before,”
the vista of mounting the stairs of a
Pompeian-like city, the blind statue
reflected in the mirror, the place inani-
mate objects play in the life of a man,
the underlying symbolism of the search
for the soft erasers . . , We, the readers,
have been taken for a ride, of course,
but it was a legitimate one, in order to
bring home more indelibly a universal
truth in relationship to ourselves.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Trade with Japan
WE’RE going to have trouble with the Japanese. The
recent visit of the president of Jetro, the Japanese
external trade organisation, Mr. Sukemasa Komamura,
was not a friendly visit to a good customer country by
any means. This was a top level expression of serious
Japanese dissatisfaction at the level of Australian imports
of Japanese goods. And no matter how politely expressed,
the fact remains that the Japanese think we are obliged
to buy more from Japan now that we are selling so much
there; the consequences for our exports to Japan if we are
not good boys are fairly clear.
So far the situation has not developed into any direct
attempts at economic blackmail, and it is unlikely that the
Japanese authorities would be so foolish, no matter what
their private thoughts on the matter. But there have been
plenty of unofficial threats. Anyone making them should
be firmly told to go to blazes.
But the Japanese case needs close attention. Their com-
plaint is not merely the old one that we sell them more
than we buy from them; that sort of absurd bilateral non-
sense is not even found in the pages of the journals that
espouse the cause of Japanese-Australian trade. It is that
the gap continues to widen; that Japanese goods have borne
the brunt of the drop in Australian imports in the first
few months of 1966-67. In the first quarter, for example,
total Australian imports (excluding the exceptional purchase
of the HMAS Hobart from the U.S.) dropped by about 5
percent on the same quarter of the previous year; imports
from Britain dropped by 10 percent, due to some extent to
the after-effects of the British seamen’s strike. Yet imports
from Japan were down 14.6 percent —a rate of fall almost
three times worse than average. And in the latest six
months period the Japanese fall has been about 18 per-
cent. “Primary producers and those developing Australia’s
rich mineral resources, particularly, must feel concern at the
long-term difficulties that could face them in finding export
markets for their products if the balance of trade between
Australia and Japan continues to develop in this way,”
says the latest monthly journal of the Australia-Japan Trade
Council.
The Japanese want a steady increase in exports to Aus-
tralia “in keeping with” the rapid rise in Australia’s ex-
ports to Japan. But they are worried thatf “it is unlikely
this will happen while the present spate of requests by
Australian manufacturers for increased protective duties
continues. Many of these requests appear to be aimed
mainly at Japanese imports.” And they say that the recent
chemical industry tariff is certain to result in a further
great reduction in imports from Japan. This sort of non-
sense has to be dealt with once and for all. In the first
place, a large part of the fall in Japanese imports is due
to the fact that the Japanese, rather foolishly, were concen-
trating their export endeavors far too heavily on consumer
goods. Everyone knows that consumer spending has been
the greatest sufferer in the economic slowdown of 1966;
Australian consumer goods industries are well aware of it.
In the second place, naturally the recent spate of tariff
requests has been aimed largely at the Japanese, and
quite sensibly so (even though in some instances the level
of protection granted to local producers has seemed ex-
cessive). The Japanese have to take the consequences of
their reckless indifference to Australia’s economic develop-
ment patterns. Rightly or wrongly (and we believe rightly,
in most cases), Australia has built up some large industries,.
MEN AND MATTERS
WHEN Mr. L. J. Thompson be-
gan work as a boy out of school
in the accountancy office of
James Robertson, H. Russell Crane and
Co. early in this century, accountants
were little more than people who
checked sums. But now accountants
play a major role in company affairs;
many sit on boards of directors. And
one of the leaders in that development
of accountants from men with green
ink on their fingers to cigars in their
pockets has been Mr. L. J. Thompson.
So this energetic 78 - year - old
accountant-director has naturally taken
a keen interest in the two questions
that have been exciting boardrooms so
much since the company crashes of
the 1960 s—the responsibilities of
directors and the role of accountants.
Like fellow accountant J. H. D. Marks,
L. J. Thompson wants the Government
to take a larger stake in regulating
some aspects of the capital market,
particularly in establishing the bona
fides of companies seeking to borrow
money from the public.
Using the recent annual meeting
of APA, of which he is chairman, as
a platform to air his disquiet about
the ease with which anyone can call
himself a company director, Mr.
Thompson suggested legislation to re-
quire a director of a public company
to be admitted to a statutory board
under the Com-
panies Act. Mr.
Thompson’s latest
suggestion has
created quite a fuss;
•the weight of pro-
fessional opinion
does not appear to
be behind him on
this occasion. He
has also publicly
expressed his con-
cern at the burden
of responsibilties
placed on directors,
which does not extend to managers
who are not members of the board.
The~~ section of the Companies Act
providing for a year’s jail or $2OOO
fine or both for untrue statements or
wilful non-disclosure in prospectuses
“gives one the shivers,” he said recently.
WHEN Mr. Sukemasa Komamura
came to Australia last month
to have a first-hand look at the
Australian market (and to have a chat
with Mr. McEwan about how Japanese-
Australian trade was going), the
Japanese were sending one of their
most important trade men. Mr. Koma-
mura has been president of the Japan
External Trade Organisation, a semi-
governmental organisation, for the past
J. H. D. Marks
S. Komamura
L. J. Thompson
two years. An alert 72-year-old, Mr.
Komamura is no government servant,
however. Since Jetro began in 1952,
its head has traditionally been a lead-
ing businessman, and Mr. Komamura
had spent a lifetime with Gosho and
Co., one of Japan’s major trading
companies, ending up as chairman of
the board before retiring to go to
Jetro.
Jetro has been active in, Australia
since early 1959, when it staged in
Sydney and Melbourne the first Japan
Trade Fairs seen in this country. Since
mid-1960 it has had in Sydney a per-
manent headquarters for Australia and
New Zealand, the Japan Trade Centre
in Pitt Street. It has since established
liaison offices in Melbourne and Auck-
land.


such as the motor vehicles and appliance trades, that are
large employers and substantial savers of foreign exchange.
They can be adequately defended on those grounds alone
in a country where the major earners of export income use
up such a small proportion of the labor force.
In setting their sights on these markets as a major part
of their attempts to sell to Australia, the Japanese are
trying to sell us what they want to export rather than what
we want to buy. We have every right to refuse to be bullied
into accepting these goods. But we do need imports—
and in huge volume. We need capital goods, in particular,
to help us in our economic development, and these make
up the bulk of our import bill. It would be absurd for
us to fritter away our export earnings on consumer goods
from Japan or anywhere else while we had such a desperate
need for capital goods. This is the area where the Japanese
should be concentrating their endeavors.
What the Japanese must do is win a bigger slice of the
market for goods we really need and to compete more
effectively with other suppliers of these goods to the Aus-
tralian market; Britain looks vulnerable, particularly if she
goes into the Common Market and loses her preferential
tariff position here. If Australia had a big trade surplus in
her dealings with the world as a whole, then the Japanese
would have every right to ask for a bigger slice of our
market in the circumstances of being our biggest customer.
But that is simply not so. We already run a huge trade
deficit, only made up each year by capital inflow which is
attracted only because we are a developing nation. It
is ridiculous for the Japanese to take the pious view that
we should destroy our own industries to enable the Japanese
to sell goods here; if the Japanese are not good enough to
beat other capital goods suppliers in this market, they should
try a little harder. And they should stop complaining when
we refuse to buy cars, television sets, and radios.
As for that threat about not buying our raw materials
unless we buy their finished products, the facts about their
purchases are that they buy our iron ore, coal, and wool
not because they like the look of our faces, but for simple
commercial reasons—it is the best available at the price. If
they could do better elsewhere, they would. No country
that depends on outside raw materials and which competes
in world markets with its finished products could even con-
sider for one moment that it might put itself to a competitive
disadvantage by switching its raw material purchases to a
more expensive source for such a silly reason. We are part
of a world trading scene; we owe nothing to the Japanese
because they happen to like buying our raw materials.
Japan is free to compete with other countries for the not-
unlimited amount of cash we have available to spend on
imports; we even wish her luck. But the bunkum being
spread by the Australia-Japan Trade Council won’t help.
Be More Cheerful
WITH the value of share turnover down 2 percent
and with the heavily weighted shares in BHP re-
sponsible for most of a mere 2.9 percent rise in
share prices from a deep trough point, the year to Septem-
ber 30 was admittedly a pretty dismal one for Melbourne
stockbrokers. This was probably bound to be reflected in
the tone of the Stock Exchange committee’s annual report
for the period, which is the most cheerless for a long time.
Why not a bit more cheer? Grumpiness is not going to
help brokers or their clients grow much richer, nor wish
the highly geared and more streamlined market facilities
better to fulfil their true function of oiling the wheels of
the private sector.
Perhaps with new chairmen in both Melbourne and
Sydney we are entitled to expect a more vigorous repre-
sentation from the Stock Exchanges to the Government to
repair the damage its policies have done since 1960 to
undermine the usefulness of the Stock Exchanges in the
nation’s financial machinery. The present position of the
Exchanges having to sit on the sidelines and wait for
drop in official interest rates to get the necessary spur
for risk investment is pathetic.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The National Bank sees a few,
“if limited,” signs that the next months may produce
greater confidence, especially among consumers, and
even expresses hope that a turning point could be reached
in the motor industry ... A majority (two-to-one)
decision of the Arbitration Commission has granted
interim margins increases to the “guide-line” metal
trades award . . . Interest rates on Treasury Notes
have been fractionally cut, so that they yield 0.32 per-
cent less if held to their 13-week maturity.
November motor vehicle registrations, at 35,488, hit
their best mark since August, 1965, but some anomalies
are suggested by the Queensland statistics . . . Private
building approvals for November rose to their highest
since May, 1965.
For the markets: The approach of the new year
is being greeted with rather more enthusiasm on Aus-
tralian share markets as a broader range of industrial
second-liners come under buying scrutiny. Actual price
variations don’t look particularly large, but interest
seems reasonably positive below the hitherto attractive
leader and metals complex.
A modest return of private and institutional buying
is helping London, which also awaits lower Bank Rate
and world interest rates. Industrials gain on chances of
the “squeeze” lessening . . . Eighteen of the last twenty
years fought to give Wall Street an end-of-year rally,
without any real success.
FOr companies : The receiver-manager of retailer
Cox Brothers has removed the chairman and managing
director, Sir Frank Richardson, from his managerial
functions; the board advises that Sir Frank “will con-
tinue to be chairman and managing director” . . .
The current half-year is to be “critical as a guide” to
the future of Sydney city and suburban retailer Anthony
Hordern; if results do not improve, a shareholders’
meeting will be called.
The takeover field is still well-tilled . . . Tech-
nologically modern Litton Industries, of America, is
holding “friendly and extensive discussions” with office
machinery distributor Business Equipment Holdings
. . . Directors of Cranvel Holdings (earthmoving equip-
ment group) are recommending a 7-for-10 share bid
from Connor Shea (agricultural machinery group) . . .
Martin Corporation has withdrawn its F. W. Williams’
bid after achieving about a 40 percent shareholding;
the world now recognises Pioneer Concrete’s success
. . . London merchant banker Slater Walker Securities
acquires 44.6 precent of Wancol Holdings, owner of
Wallerawang Collieries, and proposes “rapid” expansion
in Australia.
A happy full year appears on the cards for Mount
Morgan: both gold and copper outputs set records in
the latest 24-week period . . . Shaft repairs, lost time,
and plant commissioning continue to play some havoc
at Mount Isa, where copper production was again lower
in the four weeks to December 18 . . . Placer Develop-
ment’s subsidiary Placer Prospecting and Peko-Wallsend
propose to test Peko’s tin-bearing leases in northern
N.S.W. and may embark upon joint operations . . .
Nickel remains to the forefront, with BHP and Inter-
national Nickel (Inco) planning to prospect the Rock-
hampton area intensively.
Consolidated Press Holdings will make a 1-for-10
rights issue of 50-cent shares at $1.50 premium, to
raise $1,199,000 ... A l-for-4 par issue from earth-
moving equipment maker Conquip will bring in
$250,000.
The previously foreshadowed fall in CSR’s earnings
“should not be large”; the group at present expects to
meet all its foreseeable requirements from its own
generated funds . «, . Japanese synthetic fibremakers
Toyo Rayon and Teijin will gain an 11.5 percent
interest in Universal Textiles (Australia).

BHP, the Real Star of 1966
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
FOR all the excitement of its Bass
Strait oil and gas finds, its W.A.
iron ore interests, its nickel, and
its management changes, BHP was not
the most dynamic stock of 1966 in
terms of price rises. But it was among
the top ten on the market’s hit parade,
with a one-third jump in price during
the year; the chances are that BHP
could be among the leaders in any
further upward moves in 1967.
True, its 1966 performance looks
relatively modest alongside the big
moves in the mining market the
trebling of price for Western Mining
and Woodside, the 80 percent jump in
Mt. Morgan, and the better than 50
percent rises from Renison and King
Island Scheelite. But in capitalisation
terms, BHP’s rise has dwarfed all the
other rises of 1966.
There were some impressive ones not
only in mining (where the Consolidated
Goldfields group as a whole turned in
remarkable performances and where
CRA also did well with a one-third
price improvement). Among industrials
there were solid rises, too, despite the
dull market, like the one-third increase
by British Tobacco, whose traditional
tobacco interests staged a striking re-
covery after being pushed so firmly
aside some years before by the rising
Rothmans, whose star is now waning.
And wheq all British Tobacco’s diversi-
fication nioves begin to pay off (par-
ticularly its pastoral division, which
suffered in last year’s drought), there
could be further rewards in the stock-
market from this quarter.
But BHP was the real star of 1966,
and looks like repeating the perform-
ance in 1967, with the Chartist, for
example, forecasting rises up to $8 or
even $lO eventually. Solid reasons for
buying BHP at current prices are
given in a detailed survey into the
company’s role in natural gas which
was produced last month by the Mel-
bourne broking house of John N.
Robertson Thompson and Co. This
says its oil and gas interests alone
should bring the company a 40 percent
rise in its net profit “within a reason-
able time,” quite apart from the major
iron ore and nickel developments or
the natural growth in its iron and steel
production.
The survey argues that five years
after the introduction of natural gas
into consumer use in Victoria, BHP
should be earning about $3 million a
year from gas, net of all outgoings. And
this estimate is based on Victorian con-
sumption alone, and does not take into
account any sales to N.S.W., which
are potentially greater than Victoria. In
addition, its oilfield could be worth,
the broking house says, more than $l2
million a year to BHP, even allowing
for a lower regulated Australian crude
oil price than the present one enjoyed
by AOG.
In its traditional operations, despite
the clear problems created by the com-
pany’s need to increase its capacity in
big leaps that mean temporary depend-
ence on difficult international steel
markets, the prospects are bright in the
longer term, although the new Whyalla
works will probably not make a posi-
tive contribution for some time, and
Kwinana will also probably be a drag
for a while. As die broker points out,
BHP’s iron and steel output in the past
ten years has grown by about 9 per-
cent a year, its earnings per share over
this time have increased by 7 percent,
and its dividend growth has been at
the rate of about 11 percent a year.
All these new activities are added
cream on this solid basis.
Anniversaries can be fun, and
shareholders in the Bank of
N.S.W. are hoping to enjoy the
bank’s 150th anniversary in 1967 in one
way or another. They are not certain
what kind of party they will have.
But there is another company to
celebrate an anniversary in 1967 that
may be prepared to make a grander
gesture than the Wales. For when
G. E. Crane, the brass and aluminium
products company that has done so
well in recent years, turns 100 in 1967,
the prospects for a handsome handout
to celebrate the affair look large
indeed. Despite dividend rises in two
consecutive years, that have lifted the
payout from 10 percent to 14 percent
on capital, the company has been
ploughing about 60 percent of the
declared net profit back into the busi-
ness for years.
The company is rich enough to make
a really generous gesture in 1967 that
could at least justify latest prices around
$5.20, for the small dividend yield of
2.7 percent is backed by an earning
yield of 6.9 percent. There are still
a few family shares coming on to the
market as part of a long-term diversi-
fication of investments that has been
going on for years, but this is just as
well otherwise there would be too
few sellers to make a market in the
stock.
And as an added factor in the bonus
hopes is the possibility that the chair-
man and managing director, Mr. C. G.
Crane, could well decide to retire from
the top jobs in 1967 in a blaze of glory.
The Chartist says:
INVESTORS holding PLACER DEVELOPMENT seem assured of continuing
long-term growth. The chart, which has been reproduced back to 1961, shows
a broad primary uptrend channel at a basic rate of 30 percent appreciation
per annum, with faster intermediate trend rates of up to 100 percent. The share
price movements over the past two years have formed a consolidation pattern
similar to the area of trading in 1962-63 and the stock now shows signs of break-
out topside from the congestion area on increased turnover. A move to between
$38 and $40 seems likely with an even more optimistic target of approximately
$44. Last sale price on 23-12-66 —$26.

When the Steel Industry is mentioned most people are
inclined to think of it in terms of mining, blast furnaces,
and rolling mills.
As far as it goes, this thinking is correct. But what is some-
times overlooked is that BHP employs more than 48,000
people, and these people have skills and abilities that are as
broad in their scope as the activities of the company itself.
The company does indeed need men to mine the ore,
man the blast furnaces, control the rolling mills. But
consider also her metallurgists, mechanical engineers, elec-
trical engineers, surveyors, naval architects, stenographers,
accountants, top-level administrators. People in these callings
(and scores more) are no less steel-men than those in
control of the all-important blast furnaces.
As we mentioned earlier, some of the best steel-men
wear a safety helmet. Some don’t.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
McDonald Ind. out of Trouble
THERE is no doubt that McDonald
Industries Ltd. is over the worst.
The big question is no longer
whether the company can survive but
when it will get back to paying divi-
dends.
Not so long ago the company was in
a really serious liquidity crisis; the
recent deal by which its U.S. partner
in three joint ventures, Morrison Knud-
sen, has let McDonald reduce its stake
in the ventures, along with the
December sale of its modestly sized and
modestly successful Stabilisers Pty.
Ltd. subsidiary, have gone some of the
way to getting McDonald out of its
liquidity jam. But there is still some
distance to go before the company can
get back to its old 10 percent dividend.
It probably won’t be this year, no
matter how good a profit the company
turns in.
But the 1966-67 profit should be a
good one, now that so many negative
factors have at last been removed, and
could be substantially better than last
year’s 16 percent earning rate; for the
first four months directors have de-
scribed profits as “satisfactory.” This
year’s turnover will probably be around
the $l2 to $l4 million mark and, while
this is lower than in past years, it is in
a better type of business.
'JHE big boost to profits is likely in
1967-68, when its Frances Creek
iron ore returns begin to come in. The
contract to mine and supervise the
handling and dispatch of 4 million
tons of iron ore over about eight years
from the Frances Creek mine, near
Darwin, will not bring any return from
McDonald’s 25 percent equity interest
in the mine in the current year, even
thought its first shipment will be early
this year and three are planned to have
been made by June 30. But income
should begin to flow from the com-
pany’s contract to mine and dispatch
the ore (which seems a sensible opera-
tion to entrust to the Queensland sub-
sidiary, which has so many tax losses
at present to use up).
If Frances Creek is as good as other
iron ore ventures, it could bring Mc-
Donald in at least $250,000 a year from
its equity interest apart from mining
earnings. And there will be heavy de-
preciation allowable on the mining
part of the venture, too. The Frances
Creek equity requirement is fully
covered in the company’s “other
shares at cost” of $268,000, which it
largely makes up.
Probably the most bullish thing
about McDonald is that apparently
its disasters are all behind it. The list
of disasters that hit McDonald in
recent times is frightful. The beef roads
contracts were taken on, it seems,
largely because of the late Sir Warren
McDonald’s feeling about national de-
velopment; they were hit by cyclones
and labor problems and it cost
$1,373,000, mainly accounting for the
trading losses of 1964 and 1965,
although 1964 results were also affected
by other Queensland contracts and a
loss on the Hunter River pipeline.
The next pitfall for McDonald was
its joint venture with Morrison Knud-
sen International Inc. concerning the
construction of Tullamarine airport in
Victoria. It links with M.K. in Blower-
ing Dam in the Snowy and the Mount
Dampier-Mount Tom Price railway in
W.A. were profitable and it is now
giving up part of its share of these
profits as a partial offsetting factor to
getting out of its Tullamarine liabili-
ties. But before arriving at 1965-66
profits, $107,000 was provided for loss
on Tullamarine. This year’s profits
should not be hit by this sort of thing.
These big loss operations have left
tax losses of about $900,000 for future
use. Not only have all the past ones
been completed and current ones been
provided for but for the future the
company is avoiding this risky civil
engineering business and is concentrat-
ing instead on industrial engineering,
in which it is far more expert and in
which it makes better profits. And direc-
tors say that business is good in this
field.
This move from civil engineering
accounts for the sharp fall in its stake
in contracts in progress from $1.4 mil-
lion to $908,000, which has been accom-
panied by what looks like a disturbing
rise in debtors from $864,000 to $1.4
million; directors say that these have
paid up by now.
The sale of Stabilisers, which has
carried out stabilisation of sub-grade
road and pavement materials for the
group for seven years or so, means that
the company has also withdrawn from
the roadmaking business, in which the
big oil companies now dominate. But
the sale of Stabilisers does raise some
questions about the possible disposal of
other assets like the pipe fabrication
division and the electrical division, and
certainly points to the company exer-
cising more diligence in getting rid of
its unrealistic holding in speculative
developmental land.
The company has made no further
mention of the real estate development
at Cabramatta and Geelong, referred
to in the chairman’s 1963 address.
Freehold property for development at
cost less realisations first appeared in
the 1964 accounts at almost $500,000,
and it has only been reduced to
$437,000 in the following two years.
Apparently this cannot be liquidated
without loss, but liquidity now appears
a more important consideration.
T'HE turnabout from a 1965 trading
loss of $338,000 to a 1966 profit of
$261,000 (after no tax), which was
16.4 percent on capital, was a good
performance after two unprofitable
years. The building and construction
sector of the Sydney Stock Exchange
index has been hit perhaps as hard in
the past two years as any other industry.
It would be a brave man to say the
industry’s troubles are at an end. It
is cyclical at best and, with big con-
tracts, highly hazardous. In placing
the 50c shares at 41c, the market
expects McDonald to restore its divi-
dend within two years. It only needs
a bright report, interim or otherwise,
to bring them back to par; the eventual
restoration of a 10 percent dividend
would add a further 20 cents or so a
share.

MINING
Nickel and Some Other Firsts
THE announcement by Metals Ex-
ploration N.L. that it has dis-
covered a very interesting nickel
prospect provided an appropriate end-
ing for 1966. The past 12 months
have been considerably enlivened by
this metal since the first discovery by
Western Mining Corporation Limited
at Kambalda last February. Following
reports of nickel ore intersections in
drill holes south of Kalgoorlie, investors
gave their attention not only to Western
Mining Corporation Ltd. but to other
companies on the “fringe” of nickel
mining. These included Hampton Gold
Mining Areas Ltd., as well as Gold
and Mineral Exploration N.L. and
Nickel Mines of Australia Ltd., all of
which experienced heady market
popularity and now there are strong
rumors that North Broken Hill may
join with WMC in developing the
Kambalda deposits; Norths have a large
investment portfolio which could be
drawn on to meet a large proportion
of development costs.
The find by Metals Exploration has
now completed the chain—a year ago
Australia was deficient in payable
quantities of this metal, while today
the mine at Kambalda is being de-
veloped for production and now there
is the promise of a very large ore
body at Greenvale in North Queens-
land.
The Metals Exploration prospect is
contained in a large deposit of weath-
ered serpentine rock and the company’s

members of fire fighting enterprises ltd. group
chairman, Mr. R. Hare, told share-
holders two weeks ago that it could
contain up to 100 million tons of rock
and yield 50 million tons of nickel ore.
However, the deposit, in spite of its
size, may not be nearly as attractive as
the Kambalda nickel discovered by
Western Mining Corporation Limited.
The Greenvale ore has shown values
ranging between \\ to 3 percent nickel
from a limited amount of drilling and
surface sampling, while the drill inter-
sections at Kambalda ranged in grade
up to a fantastic 12 percent and aver-
aged 5.2 percent overall.
The Kambalda nickel is contained in
a sulphide ore body (Broken Hill,
Mount Isa, and Mount Morgan are all
sulphide ore bodies), which should
minimise any problems of treatment,
as sulphide ores are usually uncompli-
cated metallurgically. On the other
hand, the Greenvale deposit is in
weathered serpentine, which has not
proved to be nearly as simple to treat
as sulphide ores. A large part of the
nickel mined in New Caledonia has
been in the form of a nickeliferous
magnesium silicate, which occurs spor-
adically in small discontinuous veins and
pockets in serpentine rock, and if the
Metals Exploration prospect is simi-
lar to this, the company may be able to
obtain the benefit of the experience of
the Societe Le Nickel. However, it is
far too early to make any real assess-
ment of the new find.
QUITE apart from nickel, the year
contained several other memorable
“firsts.” In March the first export
shipment of iron ore left Qeraldton,
Western Australia, from deposits at
Koolanooka being mined by a partner-
ship comprised of Western Mining
Corporation (50 percent) and Hanna
and Homestake, both of the U.S.
(25 percent each). During April a
price was agreed on between BHP
and Japanese customers for the ship-
ment of 50,000 tons of manganese ore
from Groote Eylandt. June saw the
establishment of commercial bentonite
deposits near Springsure in Queens-
land (by Uranium Consolidated N.L.) r
while discussions were held in July
between Comalco Industries Pty. Ltd.
(50 percent owned by CRA) and
Japanese interests regarding the estab-
lishment of a s9m. salt plant at King
Bay in Western Australia. In August
the first shipments of iron ore from
Hamersley (60 percent CRA) left, the
port of Dampier on their way ta
Japan.
October was particularly interesting.
During that month the first of the
new contracts for uranium was
announced, between Rio Algom Mines
Ltd. and the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority, for 1000 tons a year
from 1971 to 1980. Following this,
Broken Hill South Limited located the
first indications of significant deposits
of phosphate rock in Australia. If
1967 in any way repeats the experience
of the past year it will be a prosperous
one indeed.

Copper Runs into Trouble
ABOUT everything that could
happen in the copper market
did happen in the Christmas-
New Year period.
In Vietnam, first came the cease-
fire for Christmas, then the resumption
of hostilities, both of which (copper
traders being rather nervous people)
produced marked price swings. And,
back in the U.N., the Rhodesian situa-
tion worsened a little more.
In Chile, the workers’ representa-
tives in Chuquicamata, the biggest
copper mine in the world (over four
times the output of Mt. Isa), rejected
the employers’ wage proposals. Man-
agement offered a 25 percent wage
lift, while the miners wanted a boost
of 60 or 70 percent.
Then the U.S. Government an-
nounced that the 150,000 short tons
of copper to be released from stock-
piles would be spread over the first
nine months of 1967, not the first six
as at first stated by President John-
son. The copper will be sold only to
fill military orders.
Military uses will take 26 percent
of U.S. fabricators’ output in the first
quarter of 1967, against 18 percent
in the last three months of 1966. In
the second quarter of 19.67 these “set-
asides” will take 29 percent of de-
liveries.
And to cap it all, late on December
23 the Congo finally acted against the
Belgian-owned Union Miniere du
Haute Katanga, following months of
wrangling. Union Miniere’s copper ex-
ports (equal to 7 percent of world
production in 1965) were halted, and
moves began to nationalise its Congo
assets.
Where does all this leave the
medium-term copper outlook? Officials
of Amax (American Metal Climax)
recently said “statistically copper supply
in 1967 should exceed consumption.”
(And an actual fall in consumption was
suggested.) But, up or down, consump-
tion will not be much different from
last year’s so the point is how dif-
ferent will production be?
Any attempt to answer this now has
to allow for at least two extra variables
—the position in Chile and the Congo;
Rhodesia, Vietnam, the mid-year U.S.
labor contract negotiations on one hand,
the stockpile release, progress on
Chilean mine expansion and general
world output increases on the other
hand, were already part of the juggling
act. The balance has definitely been
pushed toward further shortage by
these end-of-year developments.
WESTERN zinc producers
Britain, Australia, Germany, and
Canada have approached
Japanese smelters for help in cutting
production back to a balance with con-
sumption. Japan is a small but signi-
ficant exporter and her producers’ sup-
port for the output controls will
strengthen the smelters’ position.
About 5000 tons a month, or 12 per-
cent, of Japan’s smelter production is
exported—3ooo tons to South-East
Asia and 1000 tons each to the U.S. and
Europe.
Mitsui Metal and Mining Co. con-
fused the situation late last month by
first stating that Japanese zinc smelters
had no intention of curbing production
and then a few days later stating that
talks were being held on how to co-
operate with efforts to maintain the
£stg,lo2 a ton producer price. In
its first statement, Mitsui Metal had
said the Western producers had offici-
ally asked for Japanese help in stabilis-
ing markets.
The position is further confused by
reports that Toho Zinc plans to lift
smelter output from 9000 tons a month
to 12,000 this year. Toho has plans, it
is said, to produce 30,000 tons a month
eventually, involving overseas operations
because of the electricity shortage in
Japan.
THE U.S. Government recently
showed its awareness of the
military importance of titanium
by granting priority authority for ex-
pansion plans of two producers. The
metal, hard and corrosion-resistant but
light, is produced largely from Aus-
tralia’s beach sands, and is vital for
spacecraft, supersonic airliners, and
military planes.
The Titanium Metals Corporation
of America, which has announced a
SU.S.SO million capacity expansion for
its titanium “sponge” (partly pro-
cessed metal) facilities, is a subsidiary
of National Lead, a major miner of
local deposits.
The other major U.S. producer,
Reactive Metals, is still much smaller
than Titanium Metals, but is expand-
ing even more rapidly with SU.S.7O
million expenditure planned. U.S. Steel
and National Distillers and Chemical
Corporation are joint owners of
Reactive Metals.
Meanwhile, the use of rutile as a
base for pigments is rapidly spread-
ing. The “chloride” process is now
generally accepted as being cheaper
than the “sulphate” process, which
uses ilmenite, the mineral produced by
several Western Australian miners.
National Lead is now constructing
chloride plants in Canada and Western
Germany, and a 3 6,000-ton unit in the
U.S. recently started up. •Du Pont
has a plant of similar size and Ameri-
can Cyanimid has a 20,000-ton facility.
Next on the list will be New Jersey
Zinc combined with Montecatini of
Italy, Pittsburgh Plate Glass (80 per-
cent owner of the other major world
source of rutile, in Sierra Leone), and
three smaller producers who may ex-
pand, including British Titan Products
and Farbenfabriken Bayer.
The move to rutile could have bear-
ing on the mooted venture between
Rutile and Zircon Mines (Newcastle)
Ltd. and “an overseas partner” to make
pigments at Newcastle from R and Z’s
New Zealand ilmenite. R and Z, jointly
owned by Kathleen Investments
(through Coffs Harbour Rutile) and
Peko-Wallsend Investments, announced
trial studies 6 months ago.
NIPPON Kokan Kaisha’s Mt. Gib-
son iron ore deposits near
Geraldton, W.A., are reported to
be the latest complication in Cleveland-
Cliffs’ attempts to re-negotiate its giant
iron pellets export contract with Japan.
NKK dragged its feet over the Mt.
Newman contract, but eventually signed
after assurances on port facilities. Cliffs
(and its Australian and Japanese min-
ority partners) seeks a six-month delay
in shipment, following early cost and
finance problems.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
The share list and indexes below incorporate details of the
immediate pre-Christmas and post-Christmas trading sessions.
In both of these dealings were traditionally and seasonally
light, with ranges and volumes quite narrow. However, most
index sections have been able to maintain the market’s accession
of strength which began in mid-November. Yet the overall
market stays some way under its 1966 peak, achieved on July
21. Investors are plainly pinning a measure of hope on an
officially inspired fall in interest rates. A slight edge has been
taken from leaders and noa-ferrous metals.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Can Minster Fight Back?
OF the five stocks which have been
considered in this series, Minster
Ltd. is the one which seems to
have suffered most loss of favor in
investors’ eyes. Early in 1965, the price
reached a peak of $10.65, but, as this
was cum the one-for-three bonus issue,
it would be the equivalent of a price
of $8 approximately for today’s shares.
The shares have sold as low as $2.15 in
recent times and at the time of writing
seemed to have recovered strongly to
$2.70. This latter price is only 34 per-
cent of the 1965 high price.
The investor who purchased 100
shares at the average of the high and
low prices of 1959 would have paid
the equivalent of $573 (ignoring
brokerage and stamp duty) and today
he would have 200 shares worth about
$540. But, if he had been clever enough
to sell out just before the shares went
ex-bonus in 1965, he would have
received $1597 for his holding. One
might well wonder whether there is
any such thing as a long-term invest-
ment and, if one comes to the conclusion
that there is not, then when is the
appropriate time to quit a stock?
Although the peak price was reached
in January, 1965, it is likely that the
fall that occurred after the bonus issue
was only in line with the general market
decline. Some short recovery did, in
fact, occur in mid-1965 and the sharp
fall in the share price did not take
place until early 1966. It would now
seem in retrospect that the interim
report of 1965-66 was responsible for
the otherwise sudden loss of confidence
in the shares. This report said: “Sales
for the six months ended December,
1965, have not met the same volume
as the corresponding period of 1964.
Competition remains intense and profits
have been affected accordingly.”
One would not have thought that a
statement such as this would have been
sufficient to halve the share price, which
was already well down (30 percent) on
prices 12 months earlier and it is
obviously necessary to look a little
further.
back to the 1965 annual
report, it would have been noticed
that trading profit failed to increase by
any significant amount over the 1963-64
figure; it may well be that the figure
was, in fact, a decrease, for the 1963-64
figure was. after undisclosed outside
shareholders’ interests which could well
have been negative. Profit before tax
declined fractionally but, because the
tax provision was down about $lOO,OOO,
earnings and earnings per share (after
adjustment for the bonus issue) were
up significantly.
Those who wanted to dig a little
deeper might have calculated the
return on total capital employed of
trading profit, and they would have
obtained the following series of per-
centages:
Year to June 30 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966
percentages 52.7 55.2 56.5 50.7 45.1 35.6
Minster had always been a highly
priced stock and one would have said
that, to be worth a percent dividend
yield, dividends per share would need
to increase in the future at a rate of
at least 13 percent compound per
annum. In other words, if the next
bonus issue after the 1965 one was not
to occur until 1970, then it would have
needed to be at least on a four-for-five
basis.
F OR those who prefer to make a
judgment on the basis of likely
growth in earnings per share, the earn-
ings yield after the 1965 bonus issue
was about 5 percent, i.e., the shares
were selling at about twenty times earn-
ings. This would have meant that per
share earnings would need to grow at a
rate of at least 8 percent per annum
compound for the next ten years. On a
historical basis there should have been
no problem, for over the preceding
ten years per share earnings had in-
creased at the fantastic rate of 20 per-
cent per annum compound on average.
Even those who might have noted that
in the six years to 1963-64 the rate of
growth had slowed down to percent
per annum compound would not have
been very concerned.
Today, the shares are selling at only
8.4 times latest earnings and to me
this means that the investing public are
expecting that there will be a further
decline of about 16 percent in earnings
per share in 1966-67, after the decline
of nearly 26 percent in 1965-66. Of
course, this is not the position, but
merely that the former advocates of
Minster have been frightened away by
the two words “tufted carpet” associated
with stories of the rapid growth in
demand for this type of carpet which
has occurred in the U.S. In this con-
text it must be noted that “tufted car-
pet” is associated more with the fibre
with which the carpet is made rather
than the style of carpeting. Tufted
carpet in the public’s eyes is a carpet
made from man-made fibres, and this
seems to have been the main reason for
this type of carpet’s popularity. It also
seems likely that smooth-surfaced floor
coverings (vinyl and linoleum) have
been increasing their share of the floor-
covering market, so Minster has been
facing competition on two fronts.
Despite a Press report on July 27,
1966, which said, “. . . Minster has
turned its attention to tufted carpets.
The group is looking at the feasibility
of producing tufted carpets at its
Dandenong plant,” the chairman
denied this two months later, saying
that there was already over-capacity in
this particular area. It is likely that
this over-capacity will cause some pres-
sure on profit margins in due course;
this will probably spill over into Min-
ster’s side in the soft floor - covering
business. At the present time there is
no evidence of this and the directors
of Carpet Manufacturers said in their
report for 1965-66 that better margins
contributed to the increase in profits.
It will be interesting to see whether
Minster can fight back and recapture
some of the market which it seems
have lost. For the present, it seems to
me that the shares have been marked
down too heavily and I would have
thought that a price of about $3.20
would have been closer to their value.
At this stage it is appropriate to wait
for the interim report, due in the third
week of January, 1967.


A Hostage to Consumers
By CROESUS
THE increase in wage margins
makes the expectation expressed
here a week ago that consump-
tion expenditure will increase faster
this year than last the more likely to
be realised. However, with at least
two of the main sources of income
generation, governments and rural
exports, likely to be going at full
throttle from now on, it may Ije doubted
whether personal incomes needed this
sort of boost as well.
Given what seems to have been an
increase in the propensity to spend
lately, from the general economic
standpoint this hostage to consumers
looks like a Christmas bonus to be
paid at the expense of price stability
and the present delicate position of
manufacturers whose profit margins
are slender and have been falling.
While it is true that industry will
benefit to some extent from higher
turnovers, the costs and profit margins
effects of the increased margins could
inhibit manufacturers from making a
full-blooded response.
Even saddled with this new increase
in costs, most manufacturers can be
expected to increase output. They will
perhaps be only too anxious to get
nearer capacity working, to keep pace
with any increase in orders flowing
back to them. They could also be
encouraged to rebuild stocks now at
a low level.
ON.0 N . the other hand, manufacturers
with surplus capacity who have
been easing back their fixed investment
in plant, equipment, and buildings will
see in the rise in margins another
deterrent to making fuller contributions
toward the much-needed revival in
private fixed investment over the whole
economy. Here we are at the begin-
ning of January with this new margins
slug to costs, and in a few months’
time the Arbitration Commission will
doubtless be giving another slug to
cpsts via the basic wage. Most manu-
facturers will prefer to wait until they
see what effect the increase in spend-
ing power emanating from the increase
in margins has on the flow of orders
before revising their currently de-
pressed investment expectations.
It is about time the Arbitration Com-
mission took a thorough look at the
whole question of investment expecta-
tions in its relation to wage fixing,
because in its latest decisions it ap-
pears to have entirely neglected them.
It seems to be working on the assump-
tion that fixed investment operates
independently of wages and is some-
thing of a set piece which will look
after itself and its responsibilities in
the labor absorption field, irrespective
of the level of wages. It shows no
awareness of the fundamental import-
ance of maintaining a high rate of
fixed investment to sustain the upward
march of wages. For, make no mis-
take about it, a revival in the economy
based simply on an upsurge of spend-
ing power unrelated to the trend in
fixed investment in manufacturing
industry invites repercussions on the
general economic base sustaining full
employment and rising wages.
As offsets to the weakness in fixed
investment in manufacturing and farm-
ing, much less than full comfort can
be taken in the prevailing strength of
fixed investment in city development
(particularly office building and cul-
tural places), in mineral projects, and
public works. For while both the
primary and secondary effects of such
investment on employment opportunities
and wage potentials cannot be gainsaid,
manufacturing investment holds the
main key to both employment and
wages; even now, farming investment
(which should revive this year) overall
is of more importance than mineral
(which should also continue buoyantly),
despite the latter’s more forceful in-
trusion in recent years.
„ Anybody reading this and thinking
that I’ve failed to mention tertiary in-
dustry (in which there is more fixed
investment and growing at a rapid
rate) may like to recall the opinion of
Professor - Alex Hunter in “The
Economics of Australian Industry” that
“the activities and much of the growth
of tertiary industry is closely intercon-
nected with and dependent on manufac-
turing.”
It is not as if falling profit margins
now to be affected by increased wage
margins are the only influence working
against a revival in fixed investment.
For one thing, in current condition of
reasonable price stability, there is no
offset to presently exceptionally high
interest rates (and the unwillingness of
people to invest their funds as risk
capital, which is the other side of this
coin, as there would be if prices were
rising faster). Of course, if the rise in
margins (or some other factor) resulted
in more rapid price increases, the influ-
ence of high interest rates would lessen
as a force deterring fixed investment.
This could happen, even this year,
should the rise in spending power get
out of hand, but because it would be
attended with undesirable inflationary
consequences it would be the worst way
to lighten the path of fixed investment.
Another, and probably more in-
hibiting, factor in manufacturing invest-
ment expectations is that, in some of
the biggest industries, capacity appears
to have reached a ceiling which is going
to be difficult to lift, at least without a
much more rapid rate of innovation
coupled with substantial increases in
population and manufacturing exports.
The near-term prospect of these is
not all that bright. For this year, at
any rate, most manufacturers will prob-
ably be content if they get much nearer
than they are at the moment to full
capacity working before taking bolder
steps to increase it.
BUSINESS BOOK REVIEW
Marketing for Managers
Creating Customers, Richard Graves
and Allen Campbell. West Publish-
ing Corporation Pty. Ltd., Sydney.
WRITING a text book for use by
| any practising manager is at
best a difficult task; in the
area of marketing management it is
extremely hazardous. The authors of
“Creating Customers,” Graves and
Campbell, have avoided many of the
traps they might have fallen into, but
in doing so have created others: keep-
ing their book in simple unacademic
language, for instance, seems to have
caused Graves and Campbell to over-
simplify many complex concepts.
The current generation of market-
ing executives in Australia has had
little opportunity to receive formal
education in their chosen occupation.
Many Australian businesses are still
very much production oriented. All
too many marketing executives in Aus-
tralia regard selling and marketing as
synonymous terms. Graves and Camp-
bell do well in shattering this illusion,
but they are working so hard at “sell-
ing” sales promotion they almost say
that sales promotion and marketing
are synonymous. “The aim of sales
promotion is to create customers, and
thus promote sales. Therefore, every
activity affecting the creation and at-
traction must come under this um-
brella.” This type of statement is
pushing sales promotion into areas it
has no business entering. Almost every
function within the marketing depart-
ment has as its purpose the creation
of customers. There is little doubt that
functions such as trade channel man-
agement, product development, and
pricing are all meant to create and
attract customers. How many managers
would call these three marketing
furfctions sales promotion?
Graves and Campbell cover almost
every important marketing function in
some section of “Creating Customers.”
Separate chapters are devoted to sales
promotion, customer creation, market-
ing research, finding and identifying
customers, strategies and tactics, cus-
tomer conveniences, public relations,
and the management of customer
creation. Each chapter contains an
outline of the steps necessary to carry
out the functions under study. These
outlines, basically a series of questions
and answers, are, unfortunately, over-

simplified and of questionable practical
value.
In writing a management text or
guide book it is always wise to include
examples that drive home important
points. It is in this l area that “Creating
Customers” does its job most convinc-
ingly. The 160 examples provided
help to clarify the outline presenta-
tion of the text. Some very encouraging
signs appear in the many examples
presented. While not widespread, some
of the examples mention specific Aus-
tralian manufacturers and refer to
Australian conditions. Perhaps this is
a sign that the ethic of total non-
disclosure and secrecy within Austra-
lian industry is coming to an end. One
can only hope that this is the case,
for effective marketing demands the
intelligent interchange of information.
The examples cited in “Creating
Customers” lose some of their effective-
ness because of the authors’ desire for
brevity. If the authors had reduced
the number of examples and increased
their information content the examples
would have been substantially more
effective.
While not claiming to write for the
academic student of marketing, Graves
and Campbell report several unsub-
stantiated theories as fact. “Usually a
woman’s first concern is price, which
she relates to quality, which is her
yardstick to value.” In several other
cases the authors make very positive
statements oh how to get customers to
purchase. These statements all lack the
necessary qualifications. “Every retailer
knows that customers prefer to shop
at the location most convenient to
themselves.”
qne thing about marketing theory
that we know for certain is that we
are still a long way from completely
understanding consumer motivation or
knowing how to make a customer pur-
chase. In their very honest desire to
present the executive with a working
outline, Graves and Campbell failed to
sound the warning that there is still a
great deal to be learned about market-
ing and marketing theory.
The primary value of “Creating
Customers” lies in its ability to bring
the obvious but often overlooked fact
to a manager’s attention. The chapter
on customer creation has an excellent
list of questions that should be
answered before any marketer presents
his product to a potential customer.
Chapter three, which covers the role
of marketing research, points out the
type of information that can be gained
from properly conducted surveys.
Chapters ten and 11, while very much
over-simplified, do an adequate job in
reviewing the function of staffing the
marketing department and managing
with a view toward creating cus-
tomers.
If the practising executive uses-
“ Creating Customers” to gain a better
understanding of his job he will be put-
ting the book to good use. He should
also realise that the book will not make
him an advertising wizard, nor will it
make him a competent marketing re-
searcher. Marketing management must
realise that many parts of the market-
ing job are best left to the trained
expert. The marketing executive whn
uses “Creating Customers” as a guide
to calling in an expert will have gained
a tremendous insight from the book.

MAN ON THE LAND
Farming without Subsidies
WITHOUT the mass of subsidies,
semi-subsidies, and supports,
what would Australian farming
be like? It is a good question, we
believe, because the realisation appears
to be dawning that the subsidies never
really do what they set out to do—
keep people on the farms. Inevitably
the rewards go to those who need them
least; the big get bigger and the small
farmers pack up and leave for the
cities.
There is nothing peculiarly Aus-
tralian in this. The same thing has
happened in Europe, and in the United
States. And the hardest look of all is
being taken at subsidies in the Scan-
dinavian countries which pioneered
them.
In Australia, the dairy industry is in
the throes of renegotiating its subsidy.
Yet even the industry’s own advisers
now admit that some, smaller, farms
would be better “consolidated” (i.e.,
taken over) by larger holdings.
The burden that subsidies put on the
urban taxpayer is only one reason they
should hr re-examined. It is a pretty
sound reason, in our view, and the load
is particularly burdensome in the case
of the middle-class family-man salary
earner who otherwise might provide
capital from savings for development of
Australia by Australians. The Institute
of Public Affairs has pointed out, and
has backed the claim with statistics,
that income tax hits the middle-income
earner in Australia harder than in prac-
tically any other country. The tax is
higher than in Britain, West Germany,
U.S.A., Switzerland, and France. The
present level of Government revenues
(over 30 percent of the GNP) has
reached the highest level in peacetime
history.
The Institute believes there must be
“a point where taxation imposes a
serious brake on the rate of national
development and improvements of
living standards.” We couldn’t agree
more. But as any move to reduce farm
subsidies is likely to encounter strong
farmer opposition, and as farmers have
a strong voice through the Country
Party, the impact of less subsidies on
farming needs to be considered.
F need not be nearly as bad a situa-
tion as many farmers believe.
We are not sure that the cry of
“inefficiency” really applies.
By and large Australian farmers are
not inefficient. Compared with their
counterparts in other countries they
are extremely efficient (with exceptions
of course). But most of them, efficient
or otherwise, accept subsidies as an act
of faith and any alternative is immedi-
ately suspect.
Because most farm leaders are old
men with vivid memories of the
19305, the tendency is to regard any
subsidy criticism as an attempt to put
the clock back to boom-and-bust con-
ditions. This is not necessarily so. The
cotton bounty, for example, is an im-
portant trend in that it includes, in
theory, a sliding scale of benefits which,
in theory, recede as efficiency increases.
We stress the theory part because the
indications are that farmer opinion
would like to see the cotton bounty
transformed into another all-embracing,
permanent, support device.
Without the present subsidy system
there would, unquestionably, be changes
in farming and this is what matters.
The changes could be beneficial to an
increasing majority of farmers and
could encourage more investment, and
participation, in farming by Australians.
Off-farm integration would increase, we
believe.
Off-farm integration, a phrase used
by the farm consultants, really means
more intelligent use of land and water
characteristics. It might work this way:
Irrigation farmers, instead of having a
one-crop (say rice) or one-livestock
(say dairying) role would develop a
range of activities. Making maximum
use of their irrigated land, they would
be able to provide large quantities of
coarse grains and feeds.
These same farmers might form
themselves into groups, or associations,
to lease non-irrigated, and cheap, land
where stock, in numbers, could be raised
to the weaner stage. They would not
have to give over valuable land on
their own properties to breeding stock.
The weaners could be brought on to
the irrigation properties and readied
for market under an intensive feeding
system which, probably, would not be
feed-lot but a heavy stocking, grazing
operation. This would be an off-farm,
integrated, beef operation.
In dairying the farmer might like-
wise eliminate breeding his own cows
and might buy, either from a specialist
farmer or from a group or association
farm, replacement cows ready to go
straight into the bails. All the tedious,
and often unremunerative, work of dis-
posing of bobby calves, breaking in
heifers to milking, and so on, could be
done off-farm by other people.
rpHESE are merely two very brief
excursions into what might develop.
There are many other possibilities.
Transport, obviously, is a key. There
would have to be free, imaginative
transport readjustments. We got some
of them, as temporary measures, during
the drought. There were some im-
portant lessons learned from the
drought and one was that Australia
does have the capability to provide
drought fodders and replacement
stock, but lacks the integration in farm-
ing necessary to make best use of the
capability.
As things stand, there is no need
for drastic rethinking, yet slowly, and
inevitably, the need begins to show
even under the subsidy system. Changes
are going to come, anyway. They are
merely being delayed, at great cost,
by attitudes overlaid with a depression
complex. The most unrealistic part of
all, where the traditional farmer out-
look is concerned, is the refusal to face-
up to the fact that all the subsidy
plans depend heavily on world agree-
ments which work. It is strange, often,
to read an Australian account of a
world primary industry body confer-
ence, and to read an American or Euro-
pean account of the same thing. One
wonders, sometimes, if the authors of
these accounts were even in the same
place at the same time.
A Test for Private Selling
THE selling of wool by private
treaty will have its acid test in
Australia over the next few weeks
following the appointment in Western
Australia of a receiver-manager to Wool
Exporters Pty. Ltd. This State sells
privately a higher percentage of its
wool than any other State, and this
company is among the biggest private-
treaty organisations in Australia. So,
between now and the end of January,
when the receiver-manager’s first report
is due, much of the gloss will have
been rubbed off this kind of wool
dealing, regardless of the outcome of
the investigations. While Wool Ex-
porters has been the biggest company in
this field to strike snags, it has not
been the first; and, because of the
way this kind of business depends on
improving wool prices, it is unlikely
to be the last.
Private buyers operate by contract-
ing with the grower direct to take his-
wool at a set price, usually offering
lower costs than the stock firms selling
by auction. They base their prices on
the level at the most recent auction.
When the market is rising they stand
to do well. But the trend over the-
past three years has been downward,
and this has accelerated in recent
months. Since mid-July the average
price for greasy wools has fallen from
53c to 46c per lb.; the price of average
64s is down from 117 c in November
three years ago to around 84c currently.
The attraction of private buying
has been that it offers certainty of price,
quicker payment, and less worry about
handling and delivery. This may
account for the success of the system
in the West, where up to one-third of
the State’s clip has been sold privately
in recent years; the proportion has
swung between about one-third and


the current level, 20,000 bales less than
last year, representing about one-fifth
of the State’s wool. Growers in Western
Australia, where land is being opened
up at more than one million acres a
year and money is needed for expan-
sion, have appreciated the benefits of
the system perhaps more than most
woolgrowers.
About 9 percent of the Australian
clip is sold privately. It is estimated
that, if the national figure could be
brought up to the Western Australian
figure of around 30 percent, the whole
auction system would face collapse, for
no longer would it truly represent the
market’s assessment of the value of
wool. The Wool Board has set up a
committee to look into private treaty
transactions, and to seek the attitude
of farmers to the scheme the Farmers’
Union in the West sent out question-
naires to 4627 farmers. Only two
wanted it banned; 7.7 percent said they
always sold their wool privately; 50.5
percent always sold at auction, and
41.8 percent varied between the two.
Most farmers said they wanted the
scheme retained as an alternative to
the auction system, which is considered
clumsy and expensive.
JJOWEVER, there is a strong group,
particularly among Pastoralists and
Graziers’ Association membership, who
see private treaties as a time bomb
under the auction system, and they
want auctions retained. Most of the
privately sold wool in the West is the
cream of the clip, from the Great
Southern, and this tends to depress
the average price. Opponents of private
selling believe that the present troubles
will force wool back into the auction
system, thus lifting the market and im-
proving the climate for the private
treaty people to re-establish them-
selves. Against this it can be argued
that, type for type, Western Australian
wool is no cheaper and no dearer than
wool in other States. The only way
the shake-out might affect the market
would be if potential buyers of the
creamed-off top wools (now privately
sold) were to be attracted back to the
auction floor by these wools reappear-
ing there. If this happened they would
help bid up the whole wool market.
There is as yet little tangible reason
for the backing away from private buy-
ing that already has started and inevit-
ably will continue. The situation is
outlined by Mr. Reg V. Sewell, execu-
tive member of the Australian Wool
Industry Conference, president of the
Australian Wool and Meat Producers’
Association, and head of the Farmers’
Union wool section: “Our information
is that private buyers have been work-
ing efficiently and well, and that they
are filling a requirement in the trade.
This company has been buying quite
large quantities in the agricultural
areas, paying prices attractive to the
growers concerned. Until the receiver-
manager is in possession of all the
statements of accounts and so on, any
forecast of what might have happened
is purely guesswork.
However, it is known that the Com-
mercial Banking Company of Sydney,
which instigated the appointment of the
receiver-manager, Mr. John C. Hanson,
has big secured debts with the group of
companies involved. Another of the
secured creditors is believed to be
George Ot and Co., of Boston, with
$70,000 worth of shares in an associated
company. The value of wool in hand
has been reported to be about $2 mil-
lion, for this is the peak delivery time
of the season. And the farmers con-
cerned are certainly not as well placed
as the bank. Individual amounts up to
$20,000 are believed to be involved.
Most farmers dealing with this kind
of organisation invoice in their wool.
A contract gives the buyer the right
to sell, usually within 14 or 28 days,
and ownership of the wool passes to
the company. So the farmer becomes
the unsecured creditor. The whole
system of private buying will come
under scrutiny and fire over the next
few weeks, although most farmers want
the system to flourish as an alternative.
And here the part played by the banks
is likely to become a key issue.
AGRISEARCH
The Jersian—A Superior Cross
OLD England continues to lead the
way in animal breeding. After
becoming renowned for her pure
breeds there is scarcely a county
that hasn’t given its name to a sheep,
pig, or cow —she is now showing how
to cross them in the interests of com-
mercial production. This column men-
tioned recently that almost all her
home-grown beef already comes from
dairy-cross cattle. If the momentum
of another innovation is maintained it
will not be long before most of her
milk comes from mongrel cattle.
Whereas, until a year or two ago,
visitors to England had always been
impressed by the sight of magnificently
uniform herds of pure Jerseys, Guern-
seys, Friesians, or whatever, now raga-
bash mobs are beginning to appear.
Incredible though it might seem to
the traditionalists, a hybrid was
exhibited at the last Royal Show. There
it stood, surrounded by bluebloods of
ancient ancestory, a Jersian, with
nothing to commend it by way of
appearance. But above its stall was
fixed a chart which boldly proclaimed
the Jersian’s superiority over its pure-
bred progenitors. It was displayed by
the Animal Breeding Research Organi-
sation, which has its field station and
headquarters at Cold Norton in Staf-
fordshire. There, during the last 16
years, more than a thousand cows of
the dairy breeds have been crossed and
the performance of the hybrids studied
under uniform conditions.
A Jersian is the progeny of a Jersey
bull and a Friesian cow. In milk pro-
duction characters of economic im-
portance, it is slightly above the average
of either of the parent breeds. In
fertility and vigor it is way out in
front. Jersian calf losses at birth are
50 percent lower and their survival
rate at the end of a year is 45 percent
better than the true-bloods. Fertility
in these first cross cattle is 9 percent
better. It improves a further 5 percent
if the Jersians are put to a third breed
of bull. Calf survival and cow fertility
have become crucial matters in the
dairy industry in England, where milk
and beef production are now closely
tied in a vital economic alliance.
Blessed with a sweeter climate, we
in Australia do not have nearly as
much difficulty in rearing calves as our
English cousins do. However, with their
greater vigor, it is quite likely that the
Jersian calves grow more quickly and
use feed more efficiently. And this
could be an important advantage in
dairy-beef production, which is begin-
ning to take on here also. Messrs.
Spillers Ltd., of Middle Aston Farm,
Oxfordshire, with the co-operation of
the Ministry of Agriculture, are cur-
rently investigating the beef value of
the Jersian. Their findings will have a
big influence on whether the new move
to cross-breeding will become the pat-
tern in England.
fertility not due to disease is
possibly much more serious among
our dairy breeds than we had supposed.
The latest issue of the “Australian
Veterinary Journal” carries an article
outlining what seems to be an alarming
situation. A group of CSIRO scientists
report finding an infertility rate of 28
percent in milking Shorthorn and Jersey
heifers. Anatomical abnormalities of
the genital tract are believed to be
responsible for this high figure.
The animals examined were reckoned
to be representative of these two breeds
in Victoria and perhaps even through-
out Australia. As these are the only
two breeds investigated so far, it should
come as no surprise if similar figures
are found in the other popular breeds.
Since both infective and nutritional
diseases were more or less ruled out as
possible causes, the infertility is fairly
certainly inherent. Cross-breeding,
therefore, could also give fertility a
good boost in our dairy cattle.
The British dairyfarmers plan to
“cross out” their Jersians by putting
them to beef bulls, particularly the
Charolais a breed which we should
introduce here. In this way they can
keep both activities, milk production
and dairy-beef production, swinging
along together. Alternatively, some may
choose to follow variously complicated
criss-cross breeding programs.


Chess Bulletin
ROBERT FISCHER
ROBERT FISCHER, champion
of U.S.A., has issued a chal-
lenge to Leonid Stein, cur-
rent U.S.S.R. champion, to a
match. The winner is to be the
first player to score ten points,
draws not counting. Grand-
master Stein has accepted this
challenge and the match is
scheduled to take place in
Havana early this year.
This report is one of the most
important Press releases in con-
nection with chess to be an-
nounced in recent years. In fact,
any move that Fischer makes,
whether it’s on or off the board,
creates more than a little in-
terest.
It is to be hoped that the
recent misunderstanding be-
tween the Russians and the
Americans at the Havana
Olympiad does not upset the ar-
rangements for this important
match.
Fischer’s poor performance in
the first half of the Piatigorsky
Tournament indicated that he
was seriously handicapped by
the lack of a hard-training
schedule. As he will be taking
part in the interzonal later this
year at Tunis, he is determined
that he will not again be caught
unprepared.
The following game illustrates
Bobby Fischer’s uncanny ability
to transform what appears to
be a most unsatisfactory position
into an effortless victory. The
clash occurred on board 1 in
the match between Poland and
America at the last Olympiad.
White: R. J. Fischer (U.S.A.).
Black: Jacek Bednarsky (Poland).
Opening: Sicilian Defence.
1. P-K4, P-QB4; 2. N-KB3, P-Q3; 3.
P-Q4, PxP; 4. NxP, N-KB3; 5. N-QB3,
P-QR 3; 6. B-84.
More common in this line is 6.
B-KNS. However, when playing against
a Sicilian, Fischer prefers to indulge in
an early K-side advance, and in this
game particularly he doesn’t waste any
time in doing so.
6 . . . P-K3; 7. B-N3, QN-Q2; 8. P-84,
N-B4; 9. P-B5!, N(B3)xP; 10. PxP,
Q-Rsch; 11. P-N3, NxNP;
With Fischer’s K-side blown wide
open and Bednarsky having a strong
attack, the Polish number one player
surely feels that this is his big moment.
However, the sweet taste of victory
swiftly dissipates. With his next move
Fischer not only repels the invader but
he embarks on a withering attack of
his own which can result in only one
thing—unconditional surrender. When
playing through this, game one soon
realises that the title of chess genius is
no exaggeration where Bobby Fischer
is concerned.
12. N-83, Q-R4;
The game is virtually over at this
point. What else can Black do? Pos-
sibly 12 . . . Q-K2, but this loses a
piece immediately at the very best and
one just can’t afford such a handicap
against Fischer.
13. PxPch, K-Ql; 14. R-KNI, N-B4;
15. N-Q5, QxBP; 16. B-Nsch, K-Kl; 17.
Q-K2ch!,
Here Fischer spurns the opportunity
of winning the Black Queen at the cost
of two minor pieces by 17. N-B6ch. He
has made up his own mind as to how
he will deliver the final blow.
17 . . . B-K3; 18. N-84, K-Q2; 19.
0-0-0, Q-Kl; 20. Bxßch, Nxß; 21. Q-K4,
P-KN 3; 22. NxN, Resigns.
Undoubtedly the best move at Black’s
disposal. Problem No. 5.
