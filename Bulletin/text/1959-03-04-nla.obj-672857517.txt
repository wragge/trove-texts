WALL ON WORDS
A “Bulletin” reader should hardly
be surprised to learn of any feats of
levitation by the New Zealand poet
Arnold Wall, for he has been into this
office often enough on his visits to
Australia, talked a little about him-
self, and one knew at least that, as
well as having been Professor of
English at Canterbury University
College most of his life, he is an expert
on alpine flora. Nevertheless, it is
surprising to learn from Alan Mulgan’s
preface to Wall’s The Queen’s English
(Pegasus Press) that he had climbed
the Matterhorn before ever going to
New Zealand; and afterwards, as well
as tramping every inch of the Southern
Alps, did some strolling in the
Himalayas.
Again, knowing his verse well and
his prose reasonably well, one should
not have been surprised to find “The
Queen’s English” delightful; but
really it is amazingly readable and
informative.
One of the most interesting problems
Wall discusses is, Does a cow say
“Moo”? And here, with all due trepi-
dation, one must disagree with him,
for Wall says it doesn’t: —
The only true consonants which
animals can utter are the gutturals,
not dentals or labials: no animal
uses its lips in its language, though
the horse can make an odd sort of
burring with the lips like Words-
worth’s Idiot 80y..., If I am not
mistaken the only true consonant
produced by any animal is the growl
of the dog and the purr of the cat,
two forms of the same sound ,
Since animals do not use the lips in
speaking, we may criticise the con-
ventional mode of representing the
speech of cows and sheep and their
relations. The cow, as anybody can
see, moos with her mouth wide open
and certainly does not round the lips
as we must do to produce the vowel
represented by 00. It would be much
better to spell her “Moo” as err
or urr, for there is no consonant
an it.
Well, as Wall himself says, to urr
is human.; but this reviewer, as an old
friend of cows, who will be exceed-
ingly distressed at this attack, must
protest. The cow, after all, unless it
is as silly as the Idiot Boy, does not
walk around all the time with its mouth
open ready'to say “urr.” The sound
when it is going to moo—of course it
says several other words on occasion—
comes welling up from somewhere in
its cavernous interior (from its voice-
box: thank you, Professor) and then it
opens its lips to let the thing out; and
the parting of the lips (surely?) gives
the “m” sound that makes the moo.
Or not? It must be admitted that
the reviewer has not very deeply
studied the conversation of cows; and
Wall obviously has.
That, at any rate, is the only point,
in a book where every page has a dozen
points of interest and learning, where
one would dare to argue.
Talking of changed pronunciations,
Wall reminds us that “satire,” “realm,”
“Rome” and “raillery” were once
“sateer,” “reem,” “Room” and
“ralleiy.” These are words which we
have come to pronounce as they are
spelt. We are continually altering
pronunciations in this way, says Wall,
though we are never logical or con-
sistent about it, and very often the
sound maintains its supremacy over
the spelling and we never dream, as
well we might, of pronouncing “one”
to rhyme with “stone,” “whom” with
“Tom,” “are” with “fare” or “busy”
with “Susy.”
Talking of “Liberty in Spelling”—
words which we can spell two ways,
both correctly—he reminds us that
both “despatch” and “dispatch” are
accepted, though the old and true
spelling was “dis” and the “des” only
got into the language through a mis-
take in Dr. Johnson’s dictionary. The
London “Times,” not to be overawed
by Johnson, still continues to use the
“dis”; and also, until recently (Wall
is not quite sure of the present practice)
always used the old form of “parci-
mony” for “parsimony.” So great was
Johnson’s prestige, says Wall, that
another of his mistakes has also passed
into general use; apparently Johnson
got himself mixed between “coco,” a
Portuguesa word for “mask,” and
“cacao,” and so we have “cocoa.”
Talking of “Mr. H.”, Wall reminds
us of the “terrible mess” the language
got into after the Norman invasion
when the invaders, in whose own
language the aspirate was often silent,
put it in where it should have been out
and left it out where it should have
been in. He says he has been told that
“in schools of a certain denomination,
and in those only,” “h” is pronounced
as “haitch”: and here one can offer a
suggestion. This reviewer has often
heard it in Australia from Catholic
children; and not, presumably, because
they are Catholic but because they are
of Irish descent. Is it an Irishism?
Talking of the phonetic-spelling
debate in the British House of Com-
mons a few years ago, Wall says that
when A. P. Herbert expressed some
doubt about the pronunciation of
“water” in Scotland, a Glasgow mem-
ber interjected: “We pronounce it
‘Whisky’.” Wall seems as relieved as
were all other lovers of the language
that when the second reading of the
Spelling Reform Bill was “deferred”
for six months, “that is the last heard
of this well-meant proposal.”
Perhaps enough has been quoted to
show how excellent is all Wall’s talk
about words. But one cannot resist
adding that “lago” in “Othello”—not
that Wall advocates a return to the
old form—would have been pro-
nounced “Jago” by Shakspeare and
his players. And that the word
“charm” in “a charm of finches” was
originally an onomatopoeic (“better
onomatopoetic”) term, also spelt
“chirm” and “churm,” which des-
cribed the confused sound of many
voices, not only of small birds but
even of men . . . “Charm of finches”
is, of course, a completely charming
term, but .perhaps it is just as well it
has dropped out of use for assemblages
of men. It does not seem quite the
right phrase for a political meeting or
a football-match; though “chirm” or
“churm” might still do.
Cardinal Wolsey
It is somewhat puzzling to read in
the blurb to Naked to Mine Enemies —
The Life of Cardinal Wolsey (Long-
mans), by Charles Ferguson, the testi-
mony of A. L. Rowse, who is an
authority on parts of the Tudor Age,
that “this is the best biography of
Wolsey we have or are likely to have.”
An American and “a senior editor
of the ‘Readers’ Digest’,” Ferguson is
so wrapped-up in his knowledge of

THE SUNDOWNER'S DREAM
pREMIER Cahill, of N.S.W., in his
election-speech, sounded like a
famished swaggie on the wide, bare
plains dreaming of bacon and eggs Tor
breakfast.
He dreamt mainly about things
which he himself could not procure;
things envisioned from afar in the
pantry of the Commonwealth. There
was some ingenuity and cunning in his
dreaming, as when he put forward his
tortuous idea for an amendment of
the Commonwealth Constitution to
make it possible for him to tax inter-
state road-hauliers and so enable him
to remove the burden of the per-ton-
mile tax from the necks of some of his
most ardent and financial pursuers in
key electorates; in some of which they
are almost certain to defeat his candi-
dates.
The rest of his main programme was
just as unlikely to come into being. Its
feature was housing, and the main
keystone of that was a plan for a
Commonwealth - State Housing Cor-
poration which would have an initial
capital of £25 million and apparently
produce the millenium, financied .by
special loans jointly backed by the
Commonwealth and State Govern-
ments. He had not consulted the
Commonwealth.
Against the background of this
heady dream, exhibiting Labor’s drift
away from pure Socialism, was an
anticipatory picture of its author
splashing the proceeds around with
gay abandon, in slum-clearance—
which his party has retarded for all it’s
worth because to implement it fully
would deprive the (Labor) Sydney City
Council of majority. He sees himself
handing out loans by the corporation
“up to 95 per cent, of the total” and
for 45 years at low interest achieved by
subsidy by the taxpayers; private
loans galore guaranteed to councils
encouraged to enter into the racket.
There is, of course, the same sort of
snag between Mr. Cahill’s dream-plan
and reality as there would be between
the dying swagman and his dream-
breakfast; that he has not the means to
implement it himself, and that the
owners of the means have no disposi-
tion to oblige.
Every other State Premier would
naturally recognise at once that the
plan which Mr. Cahill puts forward
would benefit nobody but the Cahill
Government—and once the money got
into its hands N.S.W. would not benefit,
either.
As for the Commonwealth, Senator
Spooner’s reaction came within minutes.
The other States were making better
progress under their housing systems
than N.S.W., he said, and there was
“no chance” that they would cgree to
the creation of the new corporation, or
that the Loan Council would be able
to secure expansion of present alloca-
tions.
ipERHAPS Mr. Cahill expected no
answer; that his scheme was put
forward merely so that it could be
rejected by the Commonwealth, a pro-
cess which, to his type of mind, would
be tantamount to shifting the responsi-
bility for his failures, enabling him to
say to the electors: “The housing posi-
tion? Thank Heaven that’s off my
shoulders!”
The next course in Mr. Cahill’s sun-
downer’s mirage is transport and roads.
A couple of city expressways which
would cost as much as a new North
Coast port or a new railway-connection
opening-up new areas for closer settle-
ment, come first, with a new bridge
over the Parramatta River; improving
of traffic-flow at railway level-
crossings; a new bridge over the Hunter
River; also completion of the road-
system from Sydney to Port Kembla
and the completion of some New
England and northern central high-
ways which have been an unconscion-
able time agrowing. And 2000 miles
of bitumen to be laid-down.
This is the Cahill Government’s
offering on roads —mainly financed
through the Commonwealth and depen-
dent on what it can squeeze out of
Canberra.
No doubt the press missed the loud
cheers which rose from the champion
of the coalmining unemployed, Dr.
Herbert Vere Evatt, who sat on the
platform looking almost like a sun-
downer’s dream-breakfast himself,
applauding every word and on his toes
to rise and praise his new-found friend
the moment the gun went off.
When he did speak, after the normal
Leftist claque had cheered him to the
echo against a background of “Good
on yer, Doc!” he was ecstatic about his
State colleague’s amazing legislative
performances.
He did not have time to praise the
rest of the “marvellous proposals.”
In Mr. Cahill’s political dream-break-
fast there was something to please
everybody’s taste —except the Labor
members of the Legislative Council,
who are threatened with loss of a
highly valued and valuable perquisite
through a referendum on the abolition
of the Legislative Council.
There were many things about
which Mr. Cahill was reticent, but
that was perhaps excusable. A
famished sundowner with nothing but
an idle dream to nourish him cannot
be expected to concentrate on his fleas
and sores while he is dreaming.
There was, therefore, a nice reticence
in the policy-speech about the near-
bankruptcy of city transport, the indis-
cipline and inefficiency of the staffs of
the railways and buses, the gradual
triumph of the taxi-cab over bus and
tram and ferry. And there was nothing
about Socialism, which Mr. Cahill and
some of his colleagues at the end of the
war vowed to introduce within 10 years
in a blaze of glory.
His plans were a recession from
Labor’s objective —a trend evident in
his proposed housing - corporation
scheme, which involves asking the tax-
payers to produce a subsidy so that
money can be borrowed in the open
market for the corporation’s purposes
at interest-rates which Labor believes
could be lowered to nothing under
Socialism. Even more so is his retreat
from party policy evident in his toll-
highways plan.
ALL in all, his policy-speech exhibits
Cahill with all the characteristics
of the desperate optimism of the sun-
downer at his last gasp: he is willing to
sell the mother of his party ideals,
Socialism, to what have always been
known at the Trades Hall as the
boodlers. He is willing to pass over his
responsibilities for housing and roads
and road-taxes in particular to the
Commonwealth. He is willing to give
anything anywhere, whether he has
or is likely to have it to give, to any-
body .who will contribute a crumb to
sustain him on the pad to the next
homestead.
Unfortunately there is an odor about
his party which tells against sympathy
or generosity in the would-be giver.
N.S.W. Labor is bleary and smells to
high Heaven of the stale metho. in
unclean political places. And it has
acquired the cunning, specious look
which tells against trust, and a habit
of bullying those whom it thinks at
its mercy and of sycophancy with those
whom it wishes to wheedle.
It is not a nice party, or even an
honestly resourceful one. Its habits are
those of the man who lives by his wits,
and its political associations are most
peculiar, like its policy-speech.


LEFT FOR DEAD


PLAIN ENGLISH
Winter in Moscow
Khrushchev’s speech on February 24
fell like a shower of icicles down the
necks of Western editors, who, for the
umpteenth time, were prepared to take
Russian professions at their face-value.
On the morning of February 24, the
day after Red Army Day, the press put
up large headlines to say: “Macmillan’s
Talks in Moscow off to a Good Start.”
It reported that “the Russians have given
an impression of great cordiality com-
bined with earnestness.” It was said that
“disarmament would be a likely subject”
for discussion.
Most papers were so excited that they
either did not mention the speeches of
Sokolovsky and other leading Russian
generals at the Red Army Day celebra-
tions, characterised with all the usual
swashbuckling threats which have been
a feature of the duel of boasts between
the U.S.S.R. and U.S. high military brass,
each threatening fiercely to blow the
other off the earth.
That these speeches were made during
Mr. Macmillan’s visit was significant
enough, but the Khrushchev speech that
followed, on the eve of the discussions
with the British leaders, seemed deliberate
tactics designed to play on British good
feeiing and divide the West.
He abruptly rejected the call of the
West for a Big Four Foreign Ministers’
conference on Berlin and the suggestion
for the suspension of nuclear tests under
international control. He wants full talks
on everything under the sun, with Poland
and Czechoslovakia included in the con-
ference, but his speech was in such
blistering and abusive terms as to make
any kind of conciliation seem hopeless,
especially in the face of the duplicity
involved in the change of tone since his
love-and-butter speech at the reception at
the British Embassy the night before.
Mr. Khrushchev obviously reads the
British papers. He has learned that many
Conservatives believed that the success
of the Government at the next election
would depend on the result of the Moscow
visit. He knows that the separation of
the United Kingdom from the United
States, even partially, on the Berlin and
other questions, would break-up Nato
and leave Germany at his mercy.
So he decided on shock tactics, com-
bined with an offer of a non-aggression
pact with the United Kingdom. His
speech was brutal in tone and with a
sneer in every line, but not so clumsy
as it seemed. It was partly meant for
the consumption of his Asiatic allies,
particularly for the Red Chinese, whose
plan to raise 30-million conscript troops
is in its initial stage, and the Middle East,
where Nasser and his friends are playing
carpet-snake and deeply shocked at the
dark alley up which their games under
the Soviet Union’s wing have led them.
Khrushchev’s offer of a non-aggression
pact with Britain was mere empty words
because (1) Russia made non-aggression
and other pacts with its Allies after
World War II and soon flagrantly
broke every treaty it made with cynical
abandon ; (2) there already is a universal
non-aggression pact in existence in the
United Nations Charter to which Russia
is a full party. Article I of the Charter
opens thus: —
The purposes of the United Nations are:
To maintain international peace and
security, and to that end: to take effective
collective measures for the prevention and
removal of threats to peace and for the
suppression of acts of aggression or other
breaches of the peace, and to bring about
by peaceful means.... and.... adjustment
or settlements of disputes or situations
which might lead to a breach of the peace.
In the preamble, the signatory nations
renounce war as. a method. The only
reason the U.N. has had no chance from
the beginning is that before the ink was
dry on the Charter, Russia began a
campaign of world-conquest through
Communism which has never ceased.
Khrushchev has now in effect com-
mitted himself to a “peace treaty” to
hand Berlin entire, along with the zone
west of it to the Elbe over to East Ger-
many. This would be tantamount to
Russian annexation under all the circum-
stances, he having announced that
Russian troops are not in East Germany
and Berlin to play skittles.
The response of the West has been
definite. Mr. Macmillan has made it
clear that, while he is ready to negotiate,
he will not break-up Nato or desert his
allies. President Eisenhower has declared
that the stubborn attitude of the Russian
leader left little hope of negotiating, but
he and all the Nato nations are at one
on his promise that neither the United
States nor its allies will yield a single
inch in preserving their undoubted rights
and those of West Berliners who are
dead against union with East Germany.
If both sides fail to compromise there
must be a head-on collision.
Cahiil on a Hot Tin Roof
The fence on which N.S.W. Premier
Cahill balanced himself precariously but
with admirable dexterity having shown
signs of white-ants or dry-rot or just
plain old-age, he was forced a short time
ago to abandon his perch. Problem was
which way to jump. On one side was
Cold Comfort Farm, housing the Keons,
the Gairs and the Kanes ; on the other
the decidedly warm, though not exactly
peaceful, dwelling of the Evatts, Cham-
berlains and Wards. Probably feeling
that it would be better to keep a roof
of some kind over his head, he chose
the latter. But instead of getting the
warmth of the kitchen, he seems to have
landed on the hot tin roof.
The Doc sat on his platform on policy-
speech night and applauded his pro-
gramme, but neither the Premier nor his
guest can really have expected that to
win any votes.
Next, D.L.P.-leader J. T. Kane, Cahill’s
right-hand man at election-time a few
years ago, threw out a few allegations
anent Cahill’s real feeling towards the
Doc. He claimed that three years ago Joe
tried hard to keep Evatt off his platform.
Kane also claimed that before he made
the final break with the A.L.P., the
Premier had offered to give him the job of
chairman of the Board of Fire Com-
missioners if he would stop opposing
Evatt, but that he had said he was not
for sale.
Cahill denied both these charges, saying
that they were deliberate untruths.
Obviously the two men can’t be both
telling the truth, but one thing is certain
—whether or not Joe tried to keep Evatt
off his platform, it’s a safe bet that he
would have felt much more comfortable
without him. As to the other charge,
the Cahill Government has made so
many political appointments and so many
men have been considered for cushy jobs
that no one wouid blame Joe for having
forgotten some of the details.
Joe’s former colleague ex-Premier
Gair also hot-footed him at the weekend
when he said on TV that when he defied
the Queensland executive of the A.L.P.
on the matter of three-weeks’ leave, Cahill
and the N.S.W. Minister for Labor and
Industry, J. J. Maloney, asked him not
to give way, because if he did “We will
have to follow suit and we will be
financially embarrassed.”
Gair split his party and went out of
office on that issue. Cahill, given similar
instructions by the N.S.W. executive,
resisted for a while, but finally obeyed
orders.
On Sunday night when reporters asked
Cahill to comment on Gair’s remarks
he declined to do so, but said he might
do so later.
Joe is in an embarrassing position.
There’s really only one reason why he’s
on that hot tin roof —it seems to offer
him the only chance of clinging to office.
It’s a queer venue for Cahill’s Last Stand,
but he has to stand there because, as in
the historic case of Casabianca and the
burning deck, it’s too hot to sit down.
Homes for the Aged
The announcement of Hugh Roberton,
Minister for Social Services, that 6000
homes for elderly men and women will
soon be available under a £2 to £1 Com-
monwealth subsidy calls for applause.
These homes are to be built by charit-
able, religious and voluntary organisa-
tions.
Nothing in social service is more
urgent than the development of these
homes, and it should be a matter of
national planning. South Australia gives
it some attention in its housing scheme,
but the only really satisfactory plan
worked-out elsewhere seems to be the
War Veterans Homes at Narrabeen, near
Sydney, and those are only on a limited
scale and could not survive save for the
lotteries which support them.
The conditions under which thousands
of old-age pensioners live in the big
cities is enough to make the heart bleed.
An investigation of one small, closely
populated area in Sydney recently
showed dozens of cases of pathetic and
lonely old people who were paying a
regulation £2 a week for rooms—if such
some of them could be called —from
which they were expected to be absent
from 9 a.m. till late in the afternoon for


the convenience of their landlords. There
seems to be no regulation of this sort
of thing, with the result that most of
these poor old bodies, lonely and either
without, or unwanted by, relatives live
in daylight mainly in the parks and
streets or anywhere that they can find a
bench.
Mr. Cahill and some other Labor
politicians might well have spent some
of the money which they propose to
hand out in the shape of raised pay,
equal pay for women, longer and uni-
versal holidays and long leave and loaf
on decent provision for housing for the
old.
Even that strange work the Sydney
Opera House, which is to cost £4 million
or so —on the preliminary estimate, any-
way—might have waited till this problem
had some attention.
It is a matter which should be heavily
on the conscience both of the State Gov-
ernments and local authorities ; as it is
on that of every down-to-earth organisa-
tion which comes into contact with it.
Perhaps Mr. Roberton might stimulate
a general inquiry into it.
Melbourne's Underground
Sir Arthur Warner, as Minister for
Transport, is meeting Melbourne’s
public-finance experts, or a representa-
tive number of them, to discuss the
means of raising the £2l million now
needed to build the underground-railway.
The announcement implies, without ex-
plicitly stating, that the Bolte Govern-
ment is committed to its construction.
The first move of any note for a
Melbourne underground was in 1925,
when the Metropolitan Town Planning
Commission reported in favor of a loop-
line from Richmond, skirting Flinders-
street station, which was then regarded
as “congested,” to the north ; and sub-
sequent reports have elaborated on this
central plan to avoid Flinders Street.
Last year a Government-appointed in-
vestigating committee recommended a
three-line rail-loop in the city, two lines
travelling from Richmond station to
Spencer Street by a loop running behind
Parliament House and down Latrobe
Street to Spencer Street, with a loop back
to Flinders Street; while a third line
would begin at North Melbourne and
follow the same route in the reverse
direction, swinging from the Treasury
Gardens to Flinders Street.
This . apparently is the scheme the
Government has adopted. In 1954 the
Parliamentary public - works committee
made a similar report. The cost then
was estimated to be in the vicinity of
£ls million, so that it had risen £6 million
in four years. What the final cost may
be cannot be accurately forecast; the
committee estimated it would be 1965
before work could begin, although it
could start in 1961 if the State could find
an additional £1,500,000 a year, or the
rich uncle in Canberra would find it
instead.
The cardinal facts the Government has"
to face, however, are that the estimated
cost of the underground has increased
each year since it was first mooted, and
each month motor traffic is more surely
choking movement in the city.
States and Efficiency
The deplorable standards of State politics
are being illustrated in many different
ways in the N.S.W. and South Australian
election-campaigns.
Playford’s Government goes to the
polls this weekend and stands a chance
of being defeated. The reason lies in its
own efficiency. From a backward State
with large areas of poor country in a
couple of decades of office Playford, a
South Australian in the fourth genera-
tion, has turned South Australia into a
vital industrial centre of the Common-
wealth.
He has initiated an era of land-
improvement typified by the now suc-
cessful A.M.P. venture at Coonalpyn
Downs. He has given the State an
appreciable fuel-supply where previously
it depended entirely on N.S.W. He has
made the most of the Rocket Range
ventures. He has guided the policy of
development by B.H.P. in such a way
that it has had to expand in S.A. in return
for iron-ore concessions.
Moreover, he has given S.A. the best
Australian housing-system, the best
policing of hotels for the comfort of
users and travellers, and industrial peace.
But he is in some danger—though one
would hope not much —because in pro-
cess of creating a ballooning prosperity
for the State, he has brought into it
thousands of workers who have been
taught from boyhood and girlhood that
it is their duty to vote for the Labor party,
which isn’t a party at all but an aggrega-
tion of quarrelling, hard-eyed, frustrated
careerists.
Even during the past Parliament Play-
ford has been carrying on with 20 sup-
porters, one of whom has to be Speaker,
against 17 A.L.P. and two Independents.
If Labor should win a seat, as it might
easily do, these independents would hold
the balance of power.
The bankruptcy and idiocy of party
politics when applied to the government
of States in an industrial age, as well
as its dangers, is shown by the pro-
gramme of Labor.
The A.L.P.’s “programme,” like that
which nearly brought disaster to New
Zealand in 1957, and had to be repudi-
ated there hot-foot to save the economy,
and like that of Cahill, consists almost
entirely of promises intended to catch
the selfish and the greedy, irrespective of
whether they contribute to progress and
a healthy economy.
Michael Richard O’Halloran, who owns
a grazing property and has the outlook
of a squatter rather than a “toiler,”
offers as electoral inducements houses for
workers on a 2\ per cent, deposit, equal
pay for men and women irrespective of
ability or capacity, restoration of the
unsettling quarterly cost-of-living adjust-
ments, three months’ long-service leave
at 10 years for all, three weeks’ annual
leave for all day-workers and four weeks
for all those on continuous shifts ; also
a half-million present of school-books to
parents in the shape of a refund of all
expenditure on them, the gift to be retro-
spective till the beginning of the year.
It is to be hoped that in N.S.W. and
S.A., as in the Federal sphere and in
Victoria, which has made more progress
under the unforthcoming and practical
Bolte than under all the Labor Gov-
ernments there in history, workers will
vote on the basis of commonsense which
dictates that while the State is on a good
thing like Playford it should keep him
for as long as he is willing to stay.
Loons for Landlords
One of the most bewildered officials in
Melbourne must be Dr. Philip Gilbert,
the City Council Health Officer, who was
recently sent on a seven-month study-tour
of Britain and Europe, and returned with
an up-to-date report on successful experi-
ments and -developments abroad,
especially in housing.
Dr. Gilbert’s report was largely ignored
by the press, but suddenly got some
dubious publicity in an oblique way when
one of the political factions in the
council seized on a reference in it to
loans for landlords to berate another
faction.
The loans for householders to make
renovations, which has been operating
successfully in Britain for a decade, is
actually one of Dr. Gilbert’s major
recommendations. The minimum amount
lent is £IOO and the maximum is £4OO,
and in every case the loan granted is only
half of the cost of the work done. The
loans are granted on the recommenda-
tion of the local authority, and there
are many safeguards, detailed by Dr.
Gilbert.
Dr. Gilbert also recommended that to
maintain existing houses, routine house-
to-house inspections should be made by
competent authorities every year and,
where necessary, statutory notices served
on owners ; that adequate playing-space
for children must be provided in new
housing developments; that in slum-
reclamations problem families should be
dispersed by being moved to houses in
different areas.
Dr. Gilbert’s recommendation for
Government loans to renovate old houses
which had been soundly built was used,
when the report came before the City
Council, by Cr. Hayes to complain of
ther destruction of homes by the Housing
Commission at North Melbourne, where
a large new block of flats will be built
on an island site.
In the North Melbourne project some
reasonably sound houses must be
demolished. Tom Hayes, who is the
leader of the D.L.P. in the Council, is
well entrenched in North Melbourne, but
the building will remove many of his
supporters from the ward. So that,
although the loans to hard-up property-
owners would be attractive to many,
they are hardly an adequate reason for
holding up a major housing project in
an inner area, where it is wanted.

“Narumee”: Melbourne’s summer heat
apparently affected most lawbreakers—
crime barely hit a headline in my daily
during the century doldrums. One
criminal, however, was caught and
penalised for his offence. He’d taken his

Tt is commonly believed that we speak
only one language. This is obvious
nonsense to anyone who reads advertise-
ments. lam assured by copywriters that,
babies apart, everyone reads ads.
Faced with such dogmatism I have
now begun to concentrate on how best
to fit children for an age in which a
sound knowledge of the New Vocabu-
lary is vita] to success.
My listing of exploratory ideas reads:
(1) Assure the children that when they
are taught the simple, comparative and
superlative at school this is really only a
way of filling-in teacher’s time.
Self: “Good, better and best, chil-
dren, were used in your father’s younger
days to tell the difference between the
quality of things and people, just as you
say, ‘l’m the best father in the world.’ ”
Son: “So you are, Dad.”
Self: “Thanks, Son, but that’s not good
enough. You must do better.”
Son: “Don’t get it.”
Self: “You must understand. I’m not
the best, but better. See it now?”
Son: “Sure. You’re colossal.”
Self: “Full marks.”
(2) Tell the children that adjectives do
not really mean what they’re supposed to.
Self: “Did you all have a good day,
children?”
Chorus: “Yes, thanks, Dad.”
Self: “Anything interesting?”
Son: “I played cricket with the boy
next-door. It was fun.”
Self: “Fun?”
Son: “Yes. Why not?”
Self: “That might have been an apt
description in my time, my boy, but I
think a better word for you to use would
be ‘massive.’ ”
Son: “Okay. It was massive.”
Self: “That’s better.”
(3) Instruct the children clearly in the
use of compound words. I am assured
that these are the word image-forms
which do so much to stimulate the buyer
and increase prosperity.
Son: “Did you see that 1959 model
down the street?”
Self: “Yes. Did you like it?”
Son: “It looked pretty good to me.”
Self: “No, Son. You’re not observant
enough. I’m positive it’s one with road-
hugging ability, true contour-brakes, a
vista-lounge interior and all-push-
buttpn performance.”
Son: “Gee!”

“There is something peculiarly flat about

the bag beneath the gay umbrella still supplies
most of the glamor that attaches to the Turf.”

As favorite goes sweeping
Past rivals for pipped-on-post winner;
The jockeys arrayed in
Gay silks, who have weighed-in

The elegant frocking ;
The cute hat, the stocking —
These add-up to little in glamor.
For that you must turn to
McShortodds, who’s learned to
Mix mystic appeal with the clamor.
There, under his brolly
He caters to folly,
Aware that your wad he’ll assassinate.
You’ll note, while he’s gleaning,
His feathers he’s preening,
Well knowing his power to fascinate.
The punters who pick ’em
By form, or pin-stick ’em,
May view the result quite alarmingly ;
Yet, on the ring quitting
This truth they’re admitting:
The bookie does grab . your notes
Charmingly !
The totalisator,
That soulless frustrator,
The symbol of mechanisation —
Though it might enrich you
It cannot bewitch you
Like him of odds-shouting vocation.
Wherever the horses
Career round the courses
You’ll always find comedy, “drammer,”
But the bloke with the bellow
And bag is the fellow
Unfailing in dishing-out glamor !

LOLO
The Fisherman of MaKave
By C. MocGREGOR
The recent reading of
Ernest Hemingway’s
epic story The Old Man
and the Sea carried me
back many years to the
Tongan Islands, and to my
friend Lolo, the young fisher-
man of Makave, a small village
on Vava’u. 1 hope he is as
happy in The Happy Fishing-
grounds beyond the farthest
horizon as he was on the day
Used when diving.
when I first met him, at The
Place of the Canoe Races. He
surely deserved to be.
He may, before he died,
have achieved his ambition to
get a “strong line-machine” —
a big-game reel from
Amelika; but he could do
quite a good job of work with-
out one, for his gear, though
simple, was very effective in
his skilful hands, and he was
acquiring a very powerful
mana, like that of his father,
Finau.
In Polynesia, as elsewhere,
“nothing succeeds like suc-
cess,” and the successful man
acquires not only a prestige
but also a supernatural power
that extends to his tools and
weapons, and Lolo Finau
would not exchange that won-
derful old fish-hook, with its
strong mana, for a dozen new
ones of exactly the same kind.
A short and sturdy young
hunchback, with well-
muscled limbs and skin burnt
nearly black by the tropic sun,
he suddenly appeared round
the high point of coral rock
at the end of the little bay.
Wading slowly through the
knee-deep water of the sandy
shelf, he towed a bobao (a
small, dug - out, outrigger
canoe) by a thick cord
attached to his belt, and he
carried a light sft. spear with
eight barbless wire tips splay-
ing out slightly from its shaft.
His ordinary dress—>-a white
calico vala was tucked-up,
dhoti-fashion, between his
thighs, and a murderous-
looking Smithfield butcher-
knife with a 2ft. blade was
held in place by his belt at
the back, while a pair of
rubber-rimmed diving-goggles
rested on his forehead.
With a cheerful boyish grin,
he gave me the usual native
greeting, “Malo lelei” (thanks
for the good), and inquired,
with a critical glance at my
light bait-casting gear, whether
1 had caught anything.
I had not much to show for
my afternoon’s effort, but there
was a 41b. sea-perch or snapper
(Lutianus sp .) that produced
some tongue-clicking and ex-
Pearl-shell lures, with hawk’s-
bill, turtle-shell hooks and
vegetable-fibre trailers; the
first, for trolling; the second,
casting-lure for bonito.
pressions “ Oiaue!” - of
amazed incredulity as he ran
a finger over my slender rod-
tip, and felt the fine linen
sewing-thread line and 3X-gut
cast.
But his amazement was no
-*-* greater than mine when I
saw the cargo in his canoe,
which held a weird and won-
derful assortment that looked
like cut-outs of rainbow of
many sizes and grotesque
shapes.
He had names for them all,
but I could only recognise a
few genera and fewer species.
Two small barracuda, a 4ft.
needle - fish (or long - tom),
wrasses and parrot-fishes,
trigger-fishes, mullets “grey”
and “red,” a 30in. herringlike
fish, possibly a “10-pounder”
—“very strong to kill with
spear”—and many others that
were complete strangers to me.
He also had two fair-sized
octopods, a large spiny lobster,
and another smaller crustacean,
one of the Scyllaridce, which
the natives call tapa-tapa,
because of its serrated “edges.”
As he was on his way home
1 went along with him, and
when he had beached the
canoe i helped him pack
the fish in a pair of coconut-
leaf baskets, which he made in
a few minutes, and helped him
to carry them across the
narrow ridge to his home.
While he was busy on the
baskets I had a look at the
rest of his gear—a heavier Bft.
spear with four single-barbed
points, a short, double-barbed,
iron-shafted stabbing-spear, an
enormous coconut-sheli bailer,
and a 6in. piece of black vol-
canic stone with several short
lengths and one long piece of
coconut-fibre cord attached to
it. That, he told me, was a
maka feke (octopus-stone).
“But it doesn’t look like an
octopus.”
“No, it look like a rat.”
And thereby hangs a tale
that I was to hear another
time.
'The house, which belonged
to Finau, Lolo’s father,
was a European-style bunga-
low, with a wide veranda all
round. Like most wooden
houses of those post-war years
of shortages, it was badly in
need of a coat of paint and
some new veranda-boards;
but the place was clean and
tidy, with bright flower-beds,
Finau’s trolling-lure: whale-
tooth ivory, with steel hook and
feather trailer.
ornamental shrubs and close-
cut grass, though its most
striking feature was its front-
door.
With beaded panelling show-
ing on its inner side, the door,
which opened outwards
“because of hurricane,” had
been built-up to a flush surface
on the outside, which was
decorated with a remarkable
trophy of fish-tails, all but two
of them belonging to members
of the mackerel-tuna family.
One of the exceptions came
from a sail-fish and the other
from a very large barracuda.
A large space in the middle
of the group was occupied by
the silhouette, in black paint,
of a tail 2ft. across from point
to point, and beneath it was
an almost obliterated inscrip-
tion in lead-pencil.
Lolo explained that the tail
had been given to a visiting
Toketa safe nisi (D.Sc.), who
wanted it for a “science-house”
—a museum “in Honolulu or
Amelika or Niu Yoki . . .” he
was not sure. The Toketa had
drawn the outline of the tail
on the door, and had written
his name and the day, but it
was a very hard name to say
and they could not read the
letters. He had given Finau a
paper about it, but the paper
got wet in a big hurricane
and went rotten.

off a few days from electioneering to
attend the special Premiers’ Conference
in Canberra. Joe will bring forward his
proposal for a Commonwealth - States
housing corporation to be financed by a
special housing loan. As this is just
another disguise for his perennial attempt
to get Canberra to finance N.S.W. housing
programmes, it isn’t likely to be accepted.

Colombo papers on January 25 carried
Leadlines to the effect that “He deplores
Australia’s color-bar.” The “he” was
apparently a member of the Australian
Apex Club decrying, in Ceylon, our
administration of the White Australia
policy. An Australian in Colombo at
the time found that Ceylonese he met
tended to regard the whole thing as a
joke. They were staunchly “Ceylon for
the Ceylonese,” and were anxious to get
rid of Indians as well as Europeans from
positions of authority and as plantation-
owners and the like. It is hard to
imagine anything more ridiculous than
an Australian journeying to Ceylon and
studiedly “deploring” the White Aus-
tralia policy.

The George-street pedestrian-crossing
at Wynyard Station (Sydney), shifted
from directly in front of the station-

front of Wynyard there was all the
standing-space of the station-concourse

of the footpath in front of the Plaza and
Peapes, with vehicles from Hunter Street
making left-hand turns through the

Those poker-machines. It seems that
the Liberal-Country-party difference of
opinion on one-armed bandits ended in
a compromise. The two parties intend to
ban the two-bob machines after 12
months’ warning, but will place no limit
on the number of one-shilling machines.
Queensland ex-Premier Gair told a TV
audience that he and Cahill discussed
poker-machines a few years ago and that
he had said that Queensland had out-
lawed the things in 1937. Gair said
Cahill replied that there were so many
operating illegally in N.S.W. it would
be hard to suppress them, adding, “We
are very poor.”
Gair said he told Cahill:
You might be, and so are we, but a
good mother has to be very, very poor

[From Canberra]
A report by the Chief Justice of Papua'
and New Guinea (Mann, J.) contained
some severe criticisms of the New Guinea
Administration and some of its patrol-
officers following the incident at Navu-
neram village, New Britain, in which
two natives were shot to death and one
injured in a melee which developed last
year when the Administration attempted
to collect the £2-per-head tax on native
adult males.
Mr. Justice Mann said that prior to
the incident there had been violent
clashes between Administration officers
and natives on four occasions, and each
time the natives had apparent success.
As a result, an attitude of arrogance
was added to the already openly hostile
feeling of many of them.
The Administration had wrongly con-
cluded that the natives were seeking to
reject its authority.
Territories Minister Hasluck, in tabling
the report, said the Government was not
going to censure or take disciplinary
action against anyone, but claimed the
lesson to be learned from the whole
unfortunate incident was the need for
the Administration to get closer to the
indigenous people and gain and retain
their trust and respect.
“Pardon me, Khrushchev, but I dropped in to have a talk, not to look at the TV.”


Cahill has emphatically denied that he
ever offered D.L.P. leader (and formei
assistant-secretary of the State A.L.P.)
J. T. Kane the post of chairman of the
N.S.W. Board of Fire Commissioners in
order to silence his opposition to Dr.
Evatt. So there it stands. Kane says it’s
true; Joe says it isn’t. One thing is
certain. Such an appointment would
have been completely in the jobs-for-the-
boys pattern that has almost become
orthodox under the Labor regime in
New South Wales,

ship Duntroon retires from the coastal

Rockdale, which N.S.W. Minister for
Public Works J. F. McGrath won by
579 votes at the last election, has become
a key seat this time. McGrath has retired
from politics' through ill-health, but
A.L.P. Left-wingers claim he delayed his
resignation until late in January so that
it would be too late to hold a fresh
pre-selection ballot. B. J. Bannon,
McGrath’s private-secretary, was chosen
by the Rockdale electorate council, but
the dissidents claim the selection should
have been made by the State executive.
A. H. Henderson, a Rockdale aider-
man and member of the A.L.P., has
nominated as an Independent (thereby
expelling himself from the A.L.P.), and
there is also a D.L.P. candidate in the
field. This, coupled with the fact that
a small boundary-adjustment is thought
to have slightly reduced Labor’s 1956
majority, explains why the Liberals are
feeling happy about the prospects of their
candidate, R. H. Hislop.

The £35-million oversubscription of the
Commonwealth cash loan was the best
result of its kind for over 40 years. Chief
explanation seems to be “unusually large
subscriptions from trading banks, brokers

term money-market,” so hopes of tax-
reductions as a result of the loan seem a
little premature.

“Bolivar”: The WeStralian Govern-
ment is not waiting for Canberra to
make up its mind about the spending of
the Commonwealth grant for the develop-
ment of the north-west. It seems to be
taking for granted approval of Premier
Hawke’s proposal that the second grant
of £2y million be spent on the construc-
tion of the Ord River dam, supplemented
by £1 million a year from Canberra and
£600,000 a year from State funds over
the period of ten years.
Survey parties will start work in the
Kimberleys as soon as the “wet” season
is over to map-out irrigation sites on
the Ord River and also on the rice-
growing project at Liveringa station.
Other parties will be surveying at the
proposed No. 2 dam site on the Ord
and at possible reservoir sites on the
Fitzroy River in the Leopold Ranges.
What is needed from the Federal
Government is an assurance that funds
for the Ord River dam will be made
available as and when wanted, so that
the project may be completed in a shorter
time than the 10 years proposed by the
W.A. Government.

Announcing plans to extend G.M.-
Holden’s Elizabeth (S.A.) project, retiring
general-manager E. C. Daum said in
Adelaide that first - stage production
would be reached at the new plant in
June, but there was no intention of
moving from the Woodville plant where
a £4y-million modernisation programme
was in progress. There were no plans
for a new, a bigger or a smaller Holden
and no immediate plans for installing
automatic transmission.
In the export field he regarded Asia,
Africa and the Pacific islands as a natural
market for the Holden, but eventually
“we might get into the west coast of
the U.S. and Canada.”

Bill Bird, the Communist secretary of
the Victorian branch of the Seamen’s
Union, really did resign, according to
Melbourne sources; he was instructed
to do so by the party, for private reasons.
Bird hasn’t done so badly for himself.
He recently had a trip as a working
hand on a new vessel from overseas and
no doubt reckoned it quite as cosy as
his secretaryship and much cushier than
conditions at sea in 1942, when he was
regularly a seaman. Every hand has his
own cabin in the Triellis, the British
Phosphate Commission ship which is
Bird’s present nest.

Ceylon’s economic and political plight
is illustrated by the fact that in 1952
there were 684 European tea-planters on
the island, in 1956 only 512, and that
90 more contemplate permanent depar-
ture this year. These experienced men
are leaving because of their uncertain
future and possible loss of savings.
Ceylonese authorities admit that the high
standard of efficiency on the estates is
bound to drop, and that it will be many
years before native-born planters can
replace them. The replanting and re-
habilitation scheme for the tea-industry
would have a far better chance of success
if supervised by expert Europeans—but
they don’t seem likely to stay.

Melbourne “Herald” Research reports
that Melbourne and Victoria are the
fastest - growing city and State. In the
four years to June, 1958, Victoria’s
population - gain was 33.6 per cent.
(289,000) of the Australian total, N.S.W.'s
was 30.9 per cent. (265,000) and other
States and territories got 35.5 per cent.
(304,000) between them.
Metropolitan Melbourne’s population
went up 13.3 per cent. (201,000) to
1,721,000, although the city proper
actually lost 3372. Last year Victoria’s
population was 2.7 million. Next year
it is expected to be 2.9 million and by
1967, 3.5 million.

“C.S.”: Right-wing unions in Melbourne
have been irked by the increasingly pro-Red
decisions of the A.C.T.U. inter-State executive,
and the A.C.T.U.’s Hobart resolutions have
been openly attacked by Jack Maynes, president
of the Federated Clerks’ Union, who is regarded
in Melbourne as the national spokesman for
Right-wing unionism.
There are four professed Communists on the
16-man executive, including Jim Healy.
On vital issues they are invariably supported
by Albert McNolty (a Victorian industry-group
nominee), frequently by Terry Winton (N.S.W.
industry-group) and occasionally by Harold
Souter, the secretary.
To complaints that the Reds dominate the
executive, the A.L.P. always replies that it is
impossible with only four Corns, in a field of
16. But the proof is in the voting—-and the
eager acceptance of every invitation from
Russia or Red China is significant.

The man behind Melbourne's wonder-
ful new Music Bowl is Kenneth Myer,
chairman of the Sidney Myer Charitable
Trust, which financed the bowl from one-
tenth of the estate willed to it by his
father, Sidney Myer, who, of course,
built-up the Melbourne department-shop
to one of the largest in the world.
Kenneth Myer is vice-chairman of the
big company, and he knows the shop
pretty thoroughly, having worked as
salesman in piecegoods, millinery, frocks
and coats, and in obscure little offices
tucked-in here and there between the
acres of selling-space.
An engaging and modest fellow, with
the family’s devotion to the shop and
an almost passionate interest in modern
engineering and its marvels, he’s a
generous patron of the arts, was hon-
orary secretary for a term of the National
Gallery Society, and collects Chinese
bronzes —an addiction that calls for a
long purse.
He won the D.S.C. for leadership in
H.M.A.S. Arunta in a successful attack
on a Japanese submarine, and was men-
tioned in dispatches for courage and
resolution in H.M.S. Tenacious in opera-
tions against U-boats. Most of his war
service was with the R.N. He’s 38.

offices are generally about one-third over-

same applies here. The increasing effi-
ciency in factories, he says, has not been
matched in offices, largely because of
looser controls and the difficulty of
measuring office-work accurately.
Senator John Grey Gorton had a fine
war record as a fighter-pilot, and, as he
was a farmer from western Victoria (a
Liberal at that), they made him Minister
for the Navy in the present Menzies
Ministry. That, however, is traditional
with the Navy —any Navy. Mostly naval
recruits hail from Alice Springs, Broken
Hill, Fort Worth (Texas, U.S.A.), Saska-
tchewan (Canada) or the Highlands of
•Scotland. Since his appointment as Navy
Minister, Gorton hasn’t lost a moment in
familiarising himself with his job—it is
NAVY-MINISTER
becoming more and more tied-in with
aerial operations—and the Service lately
has been well in the news, in spite of a
strong, accumulated smell of mothballs.
An M.A. of Oxford, Gorton enlisted in
the Air Force in November, 1940, and
served in the U.K., Singapore, Darwin and
Milne Bay. In crash-landing his aircraft
he got “rather mixed-up with the instru-
ment-panel”, and became a major job
for plastic surgery. Today, tall, lean and
athletic-looking, swinging in a bosun’s
chair from ship to ship “outside,” it is
hard to imagine him as having been
“severely wounded in air operations, and
discharged, December 5, 1944, with the
rank of Flight-lieutenant.” He intends
to make Canberra his permanent work-
ing address when not round about his
ships, and to leave his family in charge
of the farm.

ABORIGINALITIES
NOR’-WEST CYCLONE
It’s cockeye season in Australia’s Nor’-
west —laying-up time for the pearling-
luggers—and the dailies are making what
they can out of falls of an inch an hour
and totals of Min. from the one down-
pour, with winds of 100 m.p.h. and better.
It really is something to write about,
too, and I’m not going to suggest that
the Nor’-west takes it in its stride. No
one who’s been through a hurricane
would look forward to the next one;
but big blows are a feature of life up
there, and the years they don’t happen
are usually drought-years. It’s the cock-
eyes and the willy-willies that bring the
drenching rains, only some bring a lot
more wind than is wanted, and sometimes
a flood can be worse than awkward.
The worst blows are called tropical
cyclones, and northern W.A. gets an
“Could you directing, please, to Danish Consul ?”
average of roughly two of these a year.
But you can’t bet on the average. Occa-
sionally you get a year without any, or
you might get five or more in the one
season. Either way it can be bad for
the pastoralists.
But although the North takes the blast,
the effect of a cyclone in the Kimberleys
is felt all over the State and frequently
over a big part of the continent. Depends
not so much on its intensity as on the
path it takes and the distance it travels
without petering-out.
Some don’t get far inland ; some twist
and make back to the coast and finish-up
in the Indian Ocean ; some race down
the State from north to south and may
then swing across to Bass Strait. A few
years back, one which had swung out
into the Indian Ocean came south
parallel to the coast and turned inland
again south of Perth. That one brought
rain to two-thirds of the big State and a
fair part of the N.T. —to something like
750,000 square-miles.
These blows can upset a lot of unin-
formed calculations. You could win
money betting on which is the wettest
month in Kalgoorlie. The weather-men,
taking the monthly mean over the years
that records have been kept, say March. I
don’t think there’s a local inhabitant who
wouldn’t bet on May or June —it’s the
deluge brought by the odd tropical
cyclone that has raised the March
average. You might even lay an odd
bet or two on the Nullarbor. That’s
desert; but a few years back, for two
years in succession, tropical cyclones
from the north raced through to the
Bight, and for the next 12 months
trappers on the Nullarbor were supply-
ing Perth with 15,000 rabbit-carcasses a
week.
On the other hand, a good cockeyed-
bob can be just as beneficial, and just
as disastrous, in the limited locality it
affects.
Once the manager of a northern mine
met his southern director at the port and
tried to dissuade him from making the
horse-and-buggy trip out to the mine.
Big Shot wouldn’t believe country as dry
as that could carry flood-danger—until
the dry country ended abruptly at a
river running a banker. They retraced
their tracks 10 miles, still through dry
going, and were stopped again by a creek
they’d crossed that day when it was bone-
dry. Now it was a torrent, fed by rain
a cockeyed-bob had dropped miles away.
That’s the sort of thing the North does
take in its stride, despite the odd drown-
ing that occurs when even an experienced
bushman takes a chance that doesn’t
come off. And it gets enough big blows
to dispel any doubts that Broome is still
the centre of one of the world’s big
cyclonic areas.

“Not too bad if you watch ’em,” he
replied. “You get used to them writing

comes to going back to dot the i’s and

They’re no good to drove Herefords and

young nephews and nieces to swim in

with a far-back-from-the-head grip that
gives me the jitters. Last week nieces
reported a cormorant fishing, and, rush-
ing down with gun, but forgetting glasses,
I shot it swimming and came home. Five
minutes later on the patio with six tea-ing
visitors as witnesses, the pooches laid
the incriminating evidence at my feet —

“Quartercut”: Doormats described as
jute (B. 28 /1 /’59) were coir, the husk

acquired after an oakum-picking course

“Margaret”: Around showgrounds and
in country newspapers argument rages as
to whether pony-clubs are eliminating
the typically Australian-style of riding.
The pony-club adherent says that his are

and Australians, if they are ever to win
equestrian events at the Olympic Games,
must stop being insular and adopt them.
The bushman retorts that a kid who
rides like that would never survive a
40-mile ride on a blistering summer day,
and neither would that overfat, short-
stepping pony. Neither has answered the
other’s argument and both are probably
right. Pony-club style is primarily suit-
able for those to whom riding is an end
in itself, a sport or recreation in which
the only goal is the winning of trophies.
Bushmen and women have adopted it
with marked success, though they tend
to revert to the more relaxed style out-
side the show-ring. The Australian style
is, of course, a means to an end the

his left. My experience, gained on
road - gangs in the Westralian wheat-
belt in the 1930’5, when you buried
the shovel up to the maker’s name and
kept it moving, is that about 80 per cent,
of men are naturally right-handed ; but,
as you can’t place a group of all right-
handers around a truck or dray, there
always had to be some men who could
swing either way. If a man on the gang
couldn’t do that his job went to the first
applicant who said he could; so it
usually transpired that every man on the
gang was ambidextrous. It’s not hard to
learn.

“Manamoi”: Placenames? When
overlanding of stock was the usual prac-
tice, a spot one stage west of the Lachlan
crossing, at Booligal, was known as the
Adelaide Camp. From here stock head-
ing for Wilcannia and other places up
the Darling turned north, while fats for
the Adelaide market went south-west.
Similarly, a gate in a lonely stretch of
the N.S.W.-Queensland • border-fence,
about 100 miles east of the S.A. boun-
dary, is still called the Adelaide Gate,
because the route from the Bulloo area
of s.-w. Queensland to S.A. passed
through it.

less contains one or more alkaloids,

widely varying quantities, in most fresh
fruits and green vegetables, and is the
only real specific against scurvy and
Barcoo-rot. Common weeds are fairly
rich in it —among edible ones are pig-
face, fat-hen, clovers and watercress.
In The Great Boomerang, Idriess
described the blacks gorging on the lush
growth of clover that followed a good
rain in a normally arid area. The Army
plied us with raw salads for the same
reason, but, except on special stunts,
never thought of using local vegetation.
Camped near Kilcoy (Q.) in 1942, on a
creek where palatable watercress grew
knee-high, we were fed ad nauseam on
a mixture of raw onions, carrots, cabbage
and lettuce sent up regularly from
Brisbane.

country where both air and earth are
mineral:
Morning is gold, with turkey-gobble

feeding the turkeys, in her red cardigan.
She is shy without wildness,

The noon is tin. Ride through long grass.
The city is harder, bricked and planed
with initiative. Intention. Future active.
The north is easy. Rhythmed. Easy.
This town was Chillagoe, pop. seven

the Germans built the railway; later

Tin, gold, copper,
all were uneconomical.
Here was the weighbridge. Now is the

you can use them for ashtrays. The

Back at the tin-roofed Hotel Imperial
the cattlemen talk about cattle-thieves,

Evening is copper. The kangaroo
startles and bounds for the bluffs, hearing
horses ;
he is perfectly alien. There is no totem,
and—even though certain caves are
avoided—
no memory of myth to hold in one lucid,
talkative world man, kangaroo, hunger.
Totem and mineral

Mary Lou’s eyes reflect the turkeys.
Under the copper light with tree and ant-

Sleep in the general

I consider the city,

VANISHING PARROTS
T7arious quaint statements about the
rarer parrots of Australia flutter into
print every now and again.
Latest addition, as quoted by a
Sydney daily, was a claim that a
suburban bird-keeper was the only man in
the world to own a ground-parrot (per-
haps better termed swamp-parrot), which
bird he was at first refused permission
to hold because the Chief Secretary’s
Department didn’t believe the species
existed! Same report said he was going
inland to seek the night-parrot, another
bird which some people believed to be
non-existent, and which “no one had
ever brought back alive.”
Let’s put the record slraight.
Both the swamp-parrot and the night-
or spinifex-parrot are pigeon-sized birds,
colored basically green but heavily
mottled black and yellow, with, in the
swamp-parrot’s case, red on the fore-
head. They are alike, too, in that
although both fly strongly (more so than
most ground-birds) neither has ever been
known to perch in a tree.
The swamp-parrot, on the few occa-
sions Fve seen it, sprang from grass,
eddied away in snipe-like fashion, and
then dived headlong to the grass again.
As to habitat and distribution, the
night-parrot is restricted to arid,
spinifex-covered areas of the interior,
while the swamp-parrot is a denizen
chiefly of marshy areas near the coast;
it is sprinkled throughout rough herbage,
in flatfish country, in all mainland States
and Tasmania, and has been recorded
in some islands as well.
These differences in taste, added to
certain anatomical variants, and also the
odd fact that the night-parrot, for no
clear reason, is strictly nocturnal, are
very curious in the light of the bird’s
similarity in plumage-colors and in their
attachment to the earth. Presumably
they derive from a common stock, but,
“I really think We’ve got something!”
if so, why and how and when the break
occurred is a nice puzzle.
Early records, including a First-
Fleeter’s drawing, indicate that the
swamp-parrot was fairly abundant near
Botany Bay and Port Jackson when
settlement began. “Clearing of the country
and other factors, especially fires, have
since reduced the bird’s ranks drastically,
but it continues to keep a grip, though
nowhere in impressive numbers, on cer-
tain parts of N.S.W. and other States.
Since every birdologist worth his salt
is aware that the bird is “soldiering on”
—a female was filmed at a nest at no
great distance from Botany Bay a year
or two ago—l take leave to doubt the
report that Sydney authorities believed
the species to be extinct.
Also, the swamp - parrot has often
been kept in aviaries, both here and
abroad (one is possibly still held in the
Adelaide Zoo), but it’s a poor exhibit
because of its retiring disposition.
As to the night-parrot never having
been “brought back alive” —in 1867
the botanist Baron von Mueller
obtained a specimen from a station-
owner in the Gawler Range country
(S.A.) and somehow managed to
have it delivered in good fettle at
London Zoo. There it lived—through
an English winter! —for several months,
and some informative notes about its
ways and voice were recorded.
Not for many years has a night-parrot
been kept in confinement in Australia,
and there’s no sound reason why that
should be done now. What we require
is more information about the bird in a
free state —its nesting, its reaction to
seasonal changes, and, perhaps, the fac-
tors that have caused, it to acquire the
habit of lying-up by day and emerging
at night.
There are 15 skins of the night-
parrot in museums (Australia, England,
U.S.A.), and numbers of reports in recent
years, including one from the Alice
Springs area in 1956, testify to the bird’s
continued existence.
There can be no doubt, however, that
the night-parrot is very rare ; and that
seems to be the fault of Nature rather
than man. Probably the bird’s numbers
have always been scanty because of the
unreliability of its specialised food-
supply in a harsh region ; and now,
apparently, it is gradually specialising
itself out of existence.
Yet another parrot whose future is
uncertain is the species known as the
paradise-parrot, formerly termed the
anthill-, scarlet-shouldered- and beautiful-
parrot. This extremely pretty and grace-
ful bird, once well distributed over some
parts of Queensland and northern
N.S.W., is a close relative of the familiar
red-backed parrot, and yet, while the
red-back is common, the “beautiful” has
not been reported for many years.
Possibly the decline of the paradise-
parrot is related to its habit of nesting
in termites’ mounds on the ground, and,
maybe, to specialised feeding-habits that
have been affected by the spread of
sheep and cattle.

DEVALUATION A CRISIS MEASURE
A ny decision to devalue the
Australian pound would
be a crisis measure, and Aus-
tralia is far from having
reached such a crisis. This is
the view put forward by the
Bank of New South Wales in
an article on the present trend
of the economy in the bank’s
latest quarterly “Review,”
As The Bulletin put it
recently, “we have a number
of industrial problems demand-
ing local treatment before we
resort to economic antibiotics.”
However, the ’Wales points
out that this is not to say that
at some stage a currency
change will not be necessary,
nor that the restoration of
greater freedom of exchange-
rates is unattainable. But it “is
probable that a currency de-
valuation will never be con-
templated seriously as a
positive instrument of eco-
nomic policy.”
Expressing a note of con-
fidence, the bank says that if
business takes its cue for
1959 from the state of trade at
the close of 1958, it need have
no cause for pessimism. In
spite of the obviously quieter
conditions of earlier months,
last year closed on a strong
note, and, apart from seasonal
trends, no marked change of
tone is evident
The reasons for the strength
in local activity are not
altogether clear to the bank
(nor to most people), particu-
larly in the circumstances of
lower export incomes and the
uncertain state of the wool-
market, while Budgetary and
monetary policy has been only
mildly expansive.
“Nevertheless,” the ’Wales
says, “industrial production
has been well maintained and
primary production has en-
joyed a favorable season,
while interest in new invest-
ment plans appears to buoy-
up expectations of long-term
growth.”
On the basis of existing
business, the economy does not
seem to require much more
local stimulus than it is already
receiving, otherwise the deficit
in the balance-of-payments
would be worsened. Rural
income is unlikely to fall below
that of 1957-58.
The bank warns that, despite
the basic strength of the
internal economy, the key to
Australia's prosperity is the
condition of her balance-of-
payments. The economy has
so far avoided many of the
worst effects of declining ex-
port proceeds, but it can’t do
so indefinitely.
While imports into Aus-
tralia are running at about the
annual rate provided for by
the Government’s current im-
port-licensing policy, exports
have slipped in the past half-
year. Compared with the cor-
responding period of 1957-58,
export proceeds in the first half
of 1958-59 were down £75
million, mainly due to a fall
of more than 30 per cent, in
wool prices.
The ’Wales adds, however,
that prospects for the second
half of the year are a little
brighter. No substantial
recovery is expected in wool
exports, but more wheat is
available for export, and a
recent improvement has oc-
curred in world prices of dairy
products and base metals.
Meat-shipments have increased,
and the market in the United
Kingdom has greatly im-
proved.
“On this basis,” says the
’Wales, export receipts for the
year are likely to be higher
than earlier expectations,
though still below last year's
results.”
The “Review” states that the
saving grace in the balance-
of-payments has been the sur-
prisingly good inward move-
ment of capital, which in the
six months from July to
December, 1958, limited the
loss of international reserves to
£25 million, in spite of a
surplus of current payments
over receipts of £l3O million.
Not only were the Govern-
ment’s loan-raisings in London
and New York highly success-
ful, but private capital is still
strongly confident of Aus-
tralia’s current stability and
opportunities for future growth.
“This alone,” says the bank,
“should give the answer to
“My missus thinks I'm out with the boys , knocking-off
a bank."
those who have seen in the
uncertain trade-outlook a sign
of possible devaluation of the
Australian pound.”

About the same time there

Sydney sharebrokers Hatters-

moment handling a placement
of shares in N. B. Love

has been heavily oversub-
scribed.
But the latest announcement
comes from sharebrokers Wolff

will be handling a parcel of

Gillespie Bros. Holdings,

some fundamental changes. In-
cluding the profitable joint
venture into margarine and
edible oils by Allied Mills and
Gillespie’s, each has been buy-
ing-up bakeries to anchor turn-
over of flour.
This buying-up of bakeries
was forced on the milling
industry by the advent in Aus-
tralia (in 1949) of Westons, the
U.K. (and international) flour,
bread, biscuit and confec-
tionary people, who acquired
the ord. shares in Gartrell
White and other baking
concerns.
There has been a gradual
relinquishing of the unprofit-
able export-flour trade by some
millers. Allied Mills has
announced that it is giving it
up entirely.
But it seems that millers,
almost as a body, are spreading
into Australian industries
associated with flour (and
food generally) in order to
stabilise their earnings, on lines
somewhat similar to the exten-
sion of activities by the trading-
banks.
Not only stability has been
the result so far as the millers
are concerned. The move in
some cases has paid-off hand-
somely.
Overseas Capital Problems
■Qritish Tobacco’s chairman,
T. J. N. Foley, touched
on a vital subject when he said
last week that Australia was
steadily losing to overseas
interests the control of poten-
tially large enterprises. He
said that Australian businesses
were finding it difficult to do
more than raise capital for
their own expanding needs.
New industries tended to
depend on imported capital or
on direct Government assist-
ance. Many sound projects,
with promising opportunities
for long-term exploitation of
Australia’s natural resources,
were being sponsored entirely
by overseas investors.
Mr. Foley considers that the
Commonwealth Government
should promote a greater
measure of joint participation
of Australian and overseas
capital, especially in those
directions where there were
prospects of early export-gains
and import-savings.
Taxation could be modified
in a number of ways to ensure
that a greater volume of Aus-
tralian investment funds would
be available for these purposes.
Any short-term loss to Con-
solidated Revenue would be re-
couped through increased
earnings in the long-run.
Part of The Bulletin’s
economic credo for years past
has been that the double-taxa-
tion of company earnings (in
the hands of the co. and on
dividends to shareholders) is a
handicap to industrial expan-
sion, and that the method of
levying private-company tax is
a monstrous impediment to the
growth of new industries.
Even if the same sort of
taxes operate in countries such
as the U.K. and the U.S.A.,
it is no reason why they should
operate here, this country
being far behind Old World
communities both in popula-
tion and economic develop-
ment. A premium should be
placed on capital-creation and
industrial development, especi-
ally as the social-welfare school
has had such a good run for
at least a quarter of a century.
Another part of the credo
has been that there is not
enough production, not enough
profit, not enough saving and
not enough capital-creation.
It has been contended that the
best sort of capital is indigen-
ous capital, and that the more
capital we create ourselves the
more we will be able to attract
from overseas —if we need it.
With our own resources
expanding, we should be more
in a position to dictate our
own terms as to how overseas
capital shall be employed.
In brief, the key to the prob-
lem is greater overall produc-
tivity so as to have a greater
surplus of goods and services
over consumer-demand, and a
taxation system designed to
assist industry rather than
merely suit departmental con-
venience and maintain the so-
called Welfare State.

Faith in the
Future
How quickly knowledge begets knowledge
is strikingly shown in the advances being made by
science in the use of rockets.
Overseas today the liveliest topic of
conversation is how scientists are outpacing one
another in the penetration of outer space.
Little more than a year after the first launching
of a man-made satellite, the Americans have
produced one that will “talk” back to Earth.
And —so ready has been the accommodation
of the human mind to the marvels of our time —
the whole idea of a satellite soaring around the
globe has become almost commonplace beside
Man’s reaching out to circle and land on the Moon.
What an amazing age we live in! And how
swiftly the streams of discovery are running
through it!
It is not quite thirty-three years since Dr.
Robert H. Goddard, a Clark University physicist,
on his aunt’s farm in Massachusetts, was making
his first successful test of a rocket using
liquid propellants.
That was in March, 1926, and most of those
in the neighbourhood who knew of his experiments
thought it was so much vain and explosive theory.
His rocket rose to only modest height in that
first firing, before it fell in the snow. But a man’s
Faith had been justified, and his country was closer
to the achievements we read about with wonder now.
Before Dr. Goddard’s death in 1945
liquid-propelled rockets were well established in
science. Germany, notably, developed them. And
we know what staggering advances have been made
in their range and power in the past few years.
Still more astounding performances will come
in this and other great branches of modem discovery.
And the thought that should inspire us to a
superlative national effort in Australia now is that
we are blessed with a fruitful continent to develop
and to enjoy—with all its challenges and all its
rewards —in the most daring and exciting age that
mankind has entered since the human story began.

at the rate of one National
Dairy $5 share for every five
£1 Kraft shares. A 90 p.c.
acceptance was asked for, and
National Dairy have now
extended the time for accept-
ance to March 6.
The offer is made no more
equitable by the extension of
time. The earning-power of
Kraft justifies a much higher
price than that offered, and the
fact that National Dairy have
been in control of Kraft divi-
dend policy (which has been
disproportionately low in rela-
tion to Kraft earnings and to
distribution-ratios by the
National Dairy international
group in the aggregate) places
a special obligation on National
Dairy directors to ensure that
their offer to the Kraft Aus-
tralian minority is fair and
equitable.
Another Successful Loan
A £25-million cash-loan
offering has brought in the
spectacular sum of £6O million.
Large subscriptions from
trading-banks and brokers
interested in the new short-
term money-market caused the
heavy oversubscription. How-
ever, the operation followed
the successful conversion-loan

Puri Production
[From L. Owen]
VE/henever a well —in any
country which has not
been a petroleum-producer
long enough to become oil-
wise—yields a measurable, but
ephemeral, quantity of “black
gold,” the lay press, almost
invariably, on the petering-out
of the flow, carries reports that
development is being held-up.
Such a procedure by any
responsible organisation would
border so closely on insanity as
to be unthinkable, but the sug-
gestion that it has occurred
causes uninformed members
of the public to “smell a rat,”
particularly when the informa-
tion is attributed to sources
which they class as authori-
tative.
A recent example of such
reporting is the statement that
“there was no doubt that
commercial oil has been found
at Puri, but its development is
being held-up.”
It is not surprising that the
general-manager of the operat-
ing company issued a dis-
claimer in the following
terms:
The 'Puri well encountered flow-
ing oil in a sub-thrust limestone
on November 4, 1958. The initial
flow of oil was considerable, reach-
ing 1300 barrels per day, but within
two days formation-water entered
• the hole. Thereafter the oil pro-
duction declined rapidly to a
negligible flow associated with large
quantities of water. Various tech-
niques, including throttling the
flow, perforating and acidising the
formation, were tried, but failed to
restore the oil production. The
tests ended on December 21, 1958.
The discovery of some oil in
Puri No. 1, although an encourag-
ing lead, does not of itself establish
that a commercial accumulation
exists in that structure. To follow-
up the lead, my company imme-
diately formulated a programme,
having as its objective firstly the
appraisal of the Puri structure, and
secondly the testing of a neighbor-
ing structure, since a logical con-
sequence of the oil-showing at Puri
is to up-grade the prospects of trap-
structures in the immediate vicinity.
The siting of a second hole on a
sub-thrust limestone block, such as
that at Puri, is a difficult technical
problem, and before doing so, my
company decided to drill two
deviated holes from Puri No. 1 and
to undertake geological and geo-
physical surveys to obtain a better
definition of the structure. The
first deviated hole has already been
commenced—in fact, the special
directional - drilling equipment
required for the purpose was flown
direct from U.S.A. to Port Moresby
by charter plane in order that there
should be no delay in commencing
this operation. Arrangements have
also been made for geological
parties and a seismic contract team
to enter the Puri-Kereru-Bwata area
as early as possible.
The communication ends
with the categorical opinion
that there was no basis for the
statement in the press, if it
had been correctly reported.
There are several points of
very considerable interest in the
general - manager’s statement
quoted above, and it is pleasing
to record that they confirm the
concepts outlined in “Puri
Programme” (B. 25 /2/ ’59).
The Puri fold —although not
so badly broken as the Vailala
group of structures imme-
diately to the east—is by no
means a simple one.
I am not quite clear as to
the meaning attributed to the
term “sub-thrust.” As quoted,
it might imply underthrusting
rather than overthrusting. In
either case, where competent
beds are involved, fracture-
zones, extending well below the
limestone in which the oil was
found, would be produced.
These could form channels for
the migration of petroleum
from underlying strata.
If, on the other hand,
incompetent beds are involved,
overthrusting would still pro-
vide extended fracture-zones,
while the effects of under-
thrusting might terminate, in
the downward direction, almost
at the limestone itself.
In this connection, “com-
petent beds” may be defined as
strata which do not flow when
subjected to stress.
Camden Gas
[From L.. Owen]
'T'he discovery of marine
fossils in core-samples
recovered from beds belonging
to the Narrabeen Group (at the
base of the Triassic), in the
Mulgoa bore has been
described as a “significant
development.”
Although the Narrabeen
Group has been extensively
studied at outcrop without the
recognition of any definitely
marine phase, the geological
history of the lower Triassic in
no way precludes the existence
of such phases. The field evi-
dence does not lend support,
however, to the presence of
marine lenses not limited in
extent both in thickness and
laterally.
It will be interesting to learn
whether the Narrabeen Group
beds, penetrated in Camden
No. 6 bore also yield marine
fossils, particularly as the gas
encountered contains some pro-
pane, butane and pentane. The
presence of these higher
paraffins is intriguing, but the
assumption that they indicate
nearby oil —even in uncom-
mercial quantities cannot
rightly be made on the evi-
dence currently available.
There are many other
possible sources of origin of
these gases and vapors.
Frome Rocks
[i rom L. Owen]
T7ROME Rocks No. 1 well,
■*- according to a recent
press-release, drilled through
1737 ft. of rock-salt and has
been abandoned at 4000 ft., still
in that formation.
Although the abandonment
of the well was foreshadowed
in the press-release giving the
depth of the well as 3975 ft.
“unless a favorable formation
occurs soon,” the cessation of
operations at the shallow depth
of 4000 ft. was surprising.
It is now proposed to drill
Frome Rocks No. 2 well about
four miles south of No. 1 site,
and it is stated that the new
location has been selected
“after a reanalysis of the
information previously known
in the area integrated with the
findings of No. 1 well.” It
would certainly help the
correct interpretation of the
geological conditions under-
lying Frome Rocks 2 if the
position of the bottom of the
salt formation in Frome Rocks
No. 1 were known.


Lieut. Game, of Carne’s Hill
[From Miss Isjuisa F. Farm*, Flat
11, 41 JEast Crescent St., McMuhon’s
Point, N.5.W.3
eading “A View From Fern
Hill,” by David Adams, in
B. 10/12/’5B, I was keenly
interested in the description of
Bringelly.
I am writing for assistance in
my quest —that is, to find out
who is the present owner of the
land that was a grant (700
acres) to my great-great-grand-
father, Lieut. Thomas Carne,
in 1819, and is shown on old
maps as Carne’s Hill. Lieut.
Carne lived on this land from
1816, building a house he
named Bellevue.
The estate was advertised
Sketch-map showing Lieutenant Carne’s grant (shaded), and
its proximity to Carne’s Hill
first for auction and then “To
Let” in the “Sydney Gazette”
of January 13, 1825. Lieut.
Carne left Sydney on Feb. 17,
1825, with his wife and
children on a visit to rela-
tives in Cornwall and Devon
and to settle business in con-
nection with the death of his
father.
Unfortunately, he died in
Cornwall in 1829. His wife
and children returned to
N.S.W. and farmed at Appin.
Carne’s grant is shown as
situate in the District of Cabra-
matta, bounded on the west side
by Fidden’s farm bearing north 112
chains, 60 links on the north by
an east line of 113 chains, 25 links.
On the east by Jamison and Pear
farms bearing south 40 degrees west
41 chains, west 33 chains and south
80 chains, 40 links to the Bringelly
Road, and on the south by the
Bringelly Road. (Land Grants,
R.-G. Office, Sydney.)
Bellevue Farm was within seven
miles of Liverpool, near the Cross-
roads on the Cowpastures Road.
(“Sydney Gazette;” Oct. 25, 1822.)
I have been trying for years
to trace what became of
Bellevue Farm, who bought it,
and who is the present owner.
If you know the name of the
present owner 1 would like to
write for his permission to
visit the site of Bellevue for
reasons of family, sentimental
and historical interest.
[The 700 acres granted to
Lieutenant Thomas Carne has
been subdivided long since, and
the small township of Austral
j s now on part of the grant.

be bounded by the road to
Austral (Edmondson Avenue)
from main road, but it
crosses Edmondson Avenue
where a “panhandle” from the
property jutted east to the
Jamison grant. This is where it
touches the high ground of the
Carrie’s Hill ridge, and it is
, f, „
possible that the Bellevue
homestead was on this elevated
area, which is crossed by the
water _ SU p p j y canal> and is
almost suburban in the close-
ness of its present-day settle-
ment.
What is known as Carne’s
Hill today is not on part of
the Carne grant, but a high
ridge from Carne’s Hill runs
through the property right on
to Hoxton Park, Cecil Park
(known in early times as “The
Devil’s Back”) and Prospect.
The W'ater-supply canal follows
this ridge along. (See accom-
panying sketch-map.)
On the N.S.W. Lands
Department maps of today
the grant to the west of Carne’s
property is shown as having
belonged to U. Fidkin, not
“Fidden” ; otherwise all the
names tally with those given
by Miss Carne. It is possible
that Fidkin was pronounced
“Fidden,” or that some error
has crept in over the years.
Someone living in the
Austral or Hoxton Park
districts (or, possibly, even
the Sydney Water Board) may
be able to add to the story cf
what has happened to
Bellevue ; if so, they should
write to Miss Carne or to The
Bulletin.]
POSTSCRIPTS ON FERNHILL
By DAVID ADAMS
IN writing of “Fern Hill” (B.
10/12/’5B), I used the style
adopted in the military-survey
maps. But it seems, on the
word of two previous occupiers
of the property, that the
original and correct styling is
Fernhill one word. John
Fairfax in his Roods Around
Sydney spells it as one word.
There has been a consider-
able drift in some of the
aboriginal place-name spell-
ings over the years. Cobbitty is
a startling example. In the
Lands Department (electoral)
map for Nepean the creek is
spelt Cobitty Creek, the town
and trig.-station Cobbitty, while
the grant to Gregory Blaxland
at the junction of the creek and
the Nepean River is spelt Cub-
bady. Macquarie, in his
journals, spelt it as Kobbatty
and Coppetty!
The same map shows the
spelling of the nearby 3000-
acre grant to John Dixon as
Nonhorrah. Today the spelling
is Noonoora.
Away from aboriginal place-
names, Gregory Blaxland’s
2000-acre grant near Erskine
Park is shown on the electoral
map as Lee Home. Today the
occupiers of the roadside part
of it call it Leeholme. In the
editorial notes to Macquarie’s
journals of his tours it is
called Lee Howe, apparently
the M in the parish map being
mistaken (as could easily
happen) for a W.
In any case, the homestead
is on the lee side of a hill rising
to the west (and tne westerly
wind), close by South Creek,
and the name appears to have
derived from the topography.
CTnce writing the article I
have come across a printed
subdivision plan, with sales-
talk, put out by Boyd and
King, the real-estate agents
who handled the subdivision of
Hutchison's 700 acres under
the title of Cowpasture Farms,
Bringelly, which included part
of the present-day O.T.C. settle-
ment. The land was being sold
in 1890, which was probably
near the height of the land-
boom that preceded the bank-
smash of 1892 and 1893, and
the price was £6 10s. an acre.
That was a high price indeed
for those times —especially if
you multiply the figure by four
or five to bring it into rela-
tionship with the present-day
pound. Towards the end of the
last century a working-wage of
“eight-bob a day” was more of
a political aspiration than a
matter of fact.
Between the depression of
the 1930’s and the outbreak of
World War II land could still
be bought in Bringelly at
Boyd and King’s 1890 figure.
Tn spite of the calm and quiet
that seem to have settled
over Bringelly since the demise
of the Wild Colonial Pay, in
some ways it has strikingly
modern touches. The Overseas
Telecommunications station
there has had world-wide pub-
licity from picking-up the
track of artificial earth-satel-
lites, and was receiving
messages from the first Sputnik
within hours of the announce-
ment of its launching.
Bringelly had another
modern touch. A high execu-
tive of an aircraft company
some time back had his car-
driving licence suspended for
speeding. He lived at Brin-
gelly and there was enough
clear and level land round
about (near where Bold Jack
Donahoe met his end) to land

Sabrina
When Sabrina blew in from
Melbourne to Sydney Tivoli
like a southerly-buster and
took-off her coat in the milling
foyer with a display of fixed
assets which rivalled the blare
of the brass-band outside, the
reviewer realised that more was
about to be seen than the
quiet-voiced, clear-eyed child
who had been circulating
among the guests at her press-
party of the previous evening.
Gradually, as she appeared
throughout the show —always
vivacious and occasionally
reaching down to her lower
register for a bit of raucous
hoy-de-hoy—the plot emerged:
she was the good little girl
who was trying to be a bad
little girl, but without success.
The English have a gift for
transforming a low-comedy
idea into a charming and
apparently artless entertain-
ment fit for a church fete ; and
so the sketch in which Sabrina
called upon an insurance-agent
to insure her doubles entendres
went over to rapturous and
deserved applause which a
really bad little girl might not
have been able to command.
Among her more visible
support were Syd and Max
Harrison, very shrewd mimes,
who have raised the old-joke
trade into the more expensive
field of the antique; and
Billy Baxter, as suave as any
raconteur-compere at applying
to the cheek the blue which
magically turns to pink.
Nancy Spiers, venturing into
the stokehold, was beset by
stokers who seemed more
anxious to tear her apart than
do justice to her magnificent
figure. The Andrea dancers,
on the other hand, showed how
two perfect gents in evening-
dress can humor a lady who
wants to be bounced about.
The Nicoli brothers rough-
and - tumbled; the Horrie
Dargie quintet soothed the
ragged nerves of popular airs
and encouraged some brilliant
clowning by Joe Hudson ; the
Mistin Juniors, hammering a
xylophone at the audience, got
back what they put-in in the
form of thunderous handclap-
ping ; the Tivoli ballet danced
with the art which conceals art
but little else ; the lovely young
Tivoli nudes cleared-up any
details Sabrina had left us in
doubt about;and a young lady
who had been singing all the
evening left her disrobing for
a last-minute surprise.
And so, pushing out into the
fine summer night, the
reviewer’s wife clutching to her
uncompetitive bosom the
balloon with the bottle of scent
tied to it which had fallen
near her at the interval, and
lamenting that she had been
unable to achieve one of the
diamond necklaces Sabrina had
thrown to the wolves, one felt
that here had been a young
lady and a management who
knew what to do about infla-
tion —and maybe a bit more.
There was a wild charm to
the show that much more
subtle and sophisticated shows
have had to go without.
❖ ❖ ❖
Concerto Festival
In his final two concerts in
Sydney, Hungarian - born
pianist Andor Foldes, with the
Symphony Orchestra under Sir
Bernard Heinze, took-on a
rhapsody and five concerti,
including the two Beethoven
giants.
Bartok’s Rhapsody for
Piano and Orchestra, Op. 1
(first performance in Australia)
comes from the period when
the composer was under Liszt’s
influence. But whilst it has its
moments of cleverness,
it never at any point gets
close to Liszt either in style
or in gipsy subject-matter. The
reason is clear: Liszt could call
on rich melodic invention, in
which Bartok is singularly lack-
ing.
Prokofieff’s Concerto No. 1
in D Flat, a single-movement
work, fell pleasantly enough on
the ear, though its themes lack
distinction. The best of it lies
in the brief slow centre-
section. A much better
example of contemporary
writing was the First Con-
certo, by English composer
Alan Rawsthorne. Enormously
exuberant, alive with fresh,
bright ideas and a dash of tart
wit, its sparkling rhythms were
beaten out in exhilarating
style by orchestra and soloist.
In the Schumann Concerto
Foldes avoided all exaggerated
sentiment, yet succeeded in
giving a bright glow to the
romantic episodes. The inti-
mate dialogue between
orchestra and keyboard in the
intermezzo was nicely balanced,
and Foldes was at his best in
the piano’s declamations
against the ’cellos. But the
finale fell a shade short of the
stirring.
Beethoven’s Fourth in G
Major, full of defiance and
eloquence, brought forth some
splendid cadenza - playing,
notably in the first-movement.
The end-section of the allegro,
however, was marred by some
dragging against the beat by
the orchestra. The staccato
octave-playing by the strings
in the andante was finely disci-
plined. The soloist’s work was
marked throughout by strength
in the left hand, especially in
climax-building.
The “Emperor,” "which
brought the Festival to a close,
also brought pianist and
orchestra together in the most
telling collaboration of the
series. The heroic spirit was
strongly expressed in each end-
movement, with the rondo
scintillating all along its great
length. The hymnlike opening
of the adagio could scarcely
have been bettered by any
orchestra.
Of the purely orchestral
works, Shostakovitch’s “Festi-
val” Overture —also a first per-
formance in Australia—was a
welkin-cracking piece in which
the massed brasses were used
lavishly, at times even merci-
lessly, against the rest of the
orchestra. Sibelius’s “En Saga,”
a tone-poem in his early style
replete with ingratiating har-
monies, was played with
delicacy and restraint.
“West Side Story”
[From London]
This production makes
theatrical history as surely
as did “Oklahoma ! ”
It is a greater creation, if a less
satisfying experience, than
“My Fair Lady,” It elevates
the “musical” to an artistic
stature comparable with opera,
although the idiom is,
deliberately, that of popular
entertainment. And it suc-
ceeds in the prime objective of
presenting tragedy on the
lighter stage.
The work is the collabora-
tion, not by any means smooth-
running, of four men, all well
known in the American
theatre: Jerome Robbins (con-
ception and production),
Arthur Laurents (book),
Leonard Bernstein (music) and
Stephen Sondheim (lyrics).
Many times they failed to
agree, and, because they had
to earn their living, the project
was dropped and taken up
again over a period of some
four 'years. But the original
intention —to write a musical
on an aspect of contemporary
life prevailed. Laurents
couldn’t make much headway
with the chosen subject—the
troubles arising from the
Puerto Rican migration—until
he had the ingenious idea of
linking it with “Romeo and
Juliet.” That established, he
went out into the streets to
“feel” the idiom. Bernstein,
in the intervals of earning fees
by conducting symphony
orchestras, returned to the
score. And Sondheim was
invited, for his wit and
pungency, to write the lyrics.
The result, while not achiev-
ing epic quality, is immensely
interesting. Notwithstanding
London’s own racial problems,
the feud between the “Jets”
(New Yorkers) and the
“Sharks” (Puerto Ricans) fails
to stir the emotions one way
or another, possibly because
of the locale, the actors’ in-
different enunciation and the
stylised balletic treatment
which, by its athletic clarity
and purity of motion, can
never be sordid.
On the other hand, what
amounts to the rewriting of
the plot of “Romeo and Juliet”
is a framework for tenderness,
sentiment and poignancy.
Laurents follows this plot very
closely, in mood as well as in
action. Tony, first-lieutenant
of the “Jets,” meets Maria,
sister of Bernardo, the leading
“Shark,” on the neutral, if
sullenly hostile, ground of the
gymnasium. During the (tene-
ment) balcony scene there is

Don’t miss the greatest spectacle of
the year. At the 1959 Royal Easter
Show you will see our finest

secondary industry exhibits and a
feature-packed programme of
special ring events, including

Show at the Showground, Sydney.
10 DAYS - 8 NIGHTS
m
a voice off-stage. Doc, the
drug-store keeper and Tony's
boss, is equivalent to Friar
Laurence, and Anita, Ber-
nardo’s girl, to the nurse.
The lovers take each other
as partners in sincerity if not
in holy wedlock, and from that
point the tragedy deepens pre-
cipitately. Both gangs are
aligned for the “rumble” (fight)
when Tony arrives with the
intention of stopping it.
Bernardo (Tybalt) insults him.
He smothers his anger, but
his leader, Riff (Mercutio)
cannot hold himself and
engages with Bernardo. Tony
intervenes when Riff has the
upper-hand. This throws Riff
off his guard, and Bernardo
treacherously stabs him. Too
much even for Tony, who
retaliates, killing Bernardo.
From this point Laurents
diverges. Sent by Maria with
a message to Tony (hiding in
Doc’s cellar), Anita is so
inflamed with the insults of the
“Jets” that she announces
Maria has been shot in
jealousy by her parents’ choice,
Chino (Count Paris). Tony,
murder-bent, runs amok, but
is chastened by the sight of
Maria. As he goes to her he
is shot by Chino. But—and
here’s the difference that
heightens the tragedy—Maria
lives to pronounce the error
of vendetta. There is no sleep-
ing-draught, no double coinci-
dence. And, finally, as in the
original, the two factions walk
away together in contrite
reconciliation.
Bernstein’s talents as a com-,
poser are shamefully neglected
by musicologists, no doubt be-
cause of the intellectual
snobbery which pervades
serious music. He needs a
critic of distinction to cham-
pion him, as Constant Lambert
did for Duke Ellington. But
Bernstein is not a dance-band
leader with exceptional natural
gifts. His is a wider talent
which brings scholarship, wit
and finesse to his medium. He
could, as readily as others,
have composed with one eye
on the score and the other on
Tin Pan Alley. That he
doesn't confirms his artistic
integrity.
The music is an integral com-
ponent of the show, diverse in
range and mood and notably
subtle in rhythm. Bernstein
has scored for the normal
theatre orchestra, without
oboe, but with guitar, bass-
clarinets and the jazz-drum-
mer’s outfit as well as timpani.
Nonetheless, the major credit
for tl\e show’s success goes to
Jerome Robbins. His produc-
tion and choreography are to
“West Side Story” what the
poetry is to “Romeo and
Juliet.” Every detail of pro-
duction is finely conceived,
timed and worked out. The
sets are no more than token,
and his imaginative use of
lighting underlines the moods.
So, too, do his ballet
sequences, which, distinct from
“Oklahoma!”, are executed by
the actors, not by a separate
corps. He has, in fact, infused
balltt into the show in the
same way as a producer infuses
movement into a play.
The background of flick-
knife violence and juvenile
delinquency is hardly an
appealing one as the founda-
tion for an evening out, but
it should not be allowed to
deter the waverers. “West Side
Story” is unique and
exceptional.
Artbursts
Blake Prize
Many are called to the
Blake Prize, and Eric Smith
is chosen. It is becoming a
habit.
And it is not an unbecom-
ing habit, for, excepting
Thomas Gleghorn’s “The For-
saken Christ,” there are not
many paintings to rival Smith’s
“Christ is Risen,” even though
it hardly comes off.
Smith continues, in fact, his
gallant attempt to paint the
unpaintable. His last year’s
prizewinner, “The Moment
Christ Died,” attempted to
show the universe dissolved in
a blaze of white light—which
paint simply cannot achieve:
you would need to paint in
white-hot iron. “Christ is
Risen” attempts to show, in
abstract terms, the universe
whirling with joy.
Given the clue to its mean-
ing, and given all its literary
and Biblical associations, you
can read all sorts of tremen-
dous things into it; but in
itself, as a painting, it is
rather like those red-white-and-
blue windmills or propellers
children get at the Show. It
whirls, and it is red, white and
blue ; and it is ingenious and
energetic.
G 1 egh o r n’s “Forsaken
Christ” is a powerful piece of
work in its fiery reds, sombre
purples and solid, sculptural
modelling. It is also a rare
and welcome concession from
this artist (whose abstract
“Entombment” is nevertheless
a strong thing, too, so far as
an abstract can go) in that you
can see what it is about.
Matilda Lister’s “Christ
Preaching from Galilee,”
awarded the Darcy Morris
Prize, is disappointing. In the
distance, with its red hills and
colorful crowd by the seashore,
it has the look of the Italian
and Dutch religious paintings
you can see. by the score in
European galleries ; but when
you get close and look for the
fineness of those works, it just
isn’t there.
Other paintings worth look-
ing at include Charles Bush’s
“Of a People,” Maxwell
Stuart’s “Draught of Fishes,”
Gordon McAuslan’s “Exit
from the Garden,” Alex
McMillan’s “A Child Was
born,” Ernest P h i 1 p o t’s
“Nativity” and, particularly,
because of their restraint
amidst the general exuberance,
Ralph Walker’s “Christ and
the Children” and Phyl Water-
house's “Road to Calvary.”

Lymburner
Possibly for the first time
in the history of art the full
comedy and majesty of the
grenadier’s busby has been
noted: Francis Lymburner, in
his exhibition at Sydney Mac-
quarie Galleries, has no fewer
than five paintings of this
estimable object.
It is an odd subject for so
much devotion ; but, as long
as he doesn’t spend his whole
life studying it, it is worth
while, for he gets a lot of fun
out of it.
His oils generally, though
there is a richer glow of color
in “Clown and Flowers,” are
rather scrappy ; but gay. His
drawings from the Folies
Bergeres and elsewhere are
charming, and all the more so
for being slightly naughty.

gigantic and hasty turnover of
the official class from their
mandarin robes to the frock-
coat and billycock hat of
European civilisation. As a
population of 400 million
even though not organised on
the same lavish scale as the
Australian civil service—must
have required several million
of the chairborne, there was a
tremendous glut of mandarin
robes, as well as other artistic
objects, in the secondhand
market. Coolies daily brought
to one’s back-door articles of
great artistic value and offered
them for next to nothing.
Looking at the McClelland
collection and its prices the
present writer was filled with
regrets that he took only a
limited advantage of the
republican windfall.
The star exhibit is a silk
scroll-painting 21ft. square,
believed to have been painted
by Giuseppe Castiglione, an
Italian Jesuit missionary who
was employed, not as a
religious adviser but as a crafts-
man, at the courts of the
Emperors Yung Cheng and
Ch’ien Lung.
The whole scroll is con-
tained in a gold-embroidered
brocade case fastened with a
spinach - green jade hook.
Ch’ien Lung, who is more
famous • for his recipe for
making tea than for his con-
quests, is depicted with his
entourage riding on a hunting
expedition through the Jehol
Pass against a background of
pavilions, rivers and cloud-
encircled mountains. The
whole thing is executed with
the perfect skill and taste of
the Chinese calligraphist or
painter—same thing—and the
only indication of European
influence is in the distant
mountains, which are drawn in
the picturesque Chinese manner
but could have been painted by
any artist of the Renaissance
from Titian to Leonardo. Price,
£l2OO.
There isn’t a false note in this
display of porcellaneous stone-
ware, sweetmeat dishes, teapots
and dog-lions with their trans-
lucent glazes and their ex-
quisite decorations. It makes
one wonder if pottery as well
as official clothing isn’t a lost
art these days.

Cheaper Than Dirt
“The biggest and best sale
in Australia of original works
of art” at bargain prices is on
at the Victorian Artists’
Society’s galleries in Mel-
bourne. The description is true
enough. Pictures are selling
like icypols from a milk-bar
in a heatwave. The walls have
to be constantly replenished.
The pictures generally are of
a higher standard than in the
average run of Melbourne
exhibitions, and in more than
one case the prices are cer-
tainly bargain. Lesley Sin-
clair’s view of the Yarra at
Queen’s Bridge, with its fidelity
to Nature, is priced at two-
guineas. The one who
snapped that up bought the
knowledge of a lifetime spent
in painting. Judith Lord’s
“Summer Landscape,” Alan
Martin’s “Reflections” and a
bush scene by Peter Glass are
worth more than the money
asked.
Many artists do better with
a simple drawing or a sketch
in watercolor than in a finished
painting. When they are not
trying to be pretentious they
often do surprisingly good
work. Many of the paintings
in this exhibition come into
this class.
Films
“Don Quixote”
Here, from Russia, is a
masterpiece—a screenplay that
goes right to the heart of
Cervantes, produced and
directed with style and insight
by Grigory Kozintsev, and
softly colored throughout with
a rare pictorial sense.
Interpretation is practically
flawless: the episodes are tell-
ingly chosen ; the humor of the
obsessed knight’s crashing
failures never outweighs their
pathos ; and his generosity and
dignity shine through every
humiliation.
It would be hard to find
another actor with the qualities
of physique, heart and mind
which Nikolai Cherkasov
brings to the main role. Tall
and gaunt, a bit knotty and
stringy, with an expression at
once ascetic and tender, he is
straight out of Dore’s illustra-
tions ; one of the most dis-
tinguished and lovable por-
traits in the gallery of world
cinema.
Yuri Tolubeyev is an
equally convincing Sancho. Fat
and sweating, he conveys with
earthy shrewdness how deeply
he and his master, as branches
of the human spirit, depend on
each other. The episode of his
“governorship” and the con-
current episode in which the
frigid duke and his bored
courtiers mock the Don’s de-
votion and compassion provide
the greatest moments of the
film. They are so timed and
fashioned as to reveal not only
the nobility of the heroes but
the tragic emptiness of their
mockers.
Dubbing is never a wholly
satisfactory device, but here it
is done as well as one would
imagine it could ever be done.
Dialogue has been translated
into graceful and natural Eng-
lish, spoken by voices exactly
in character, and dubbed with
incredible attention to details
of timing, gesture and dialect.

“A Night to Remember”
This film pulls no punches in
distributing blame for the
needless loss of 1500 lives when
the Titanic was ripped open by
an iceberg in 1912.
The folly of those who, over-
confident of her unsinkability,
allowed the ship to sail with
2200 passengers and lifeboat
space for only 1200 ; the lazi-
ness and smugness of the men
who could have averted the
tragedy; the complacent
assumption among the first-
class passengers that they
would naturally take pre-
cedence over steerage pas-
sengers for places in the boats ;
the cowardice and panic that
grew out of corruption—
these, and a pile of minor inci-
dents gathered from the
stories of survivors, are
sharply presented.
Director Roy Baker has
marshalled his crowd scenes
with ingenuity and balance;
the mechanics of the sinking
are convincingly contrived;
vignettes of heroism and
cowardice are skilfully woven
into the fabric of the main
events, and tension is preserved
to the end.
Outstanding in the huge cast:
are Kenneth More, as the
courageous officer who strives
to preserve order against the
screaming panic ; and Michael
Goodliffe, as the Titanic’s
designer, who chooses to go
down with his mistake.

“After the Ball”
A dull backstage biography
of Vesta Tilley, who shocked
’em in the ’nineties by wear-
ing men’s clothes to sing
sentimental and comic songs in
London vaudeville. Elsewhere
she seems to have led a
singularly unexciting life,
though the film makes a feeble
attempt to work-up a romance.
Pat Kirkwood, as Vesta, has
a strong, clear and pleasant
voice ; and every woman in the
audience would like Vesta’s
recipe for looking in 1922, on
her retirement, not a day older
than she did when she made
her bow in 1889. Lawrence
Harvey is wooden as her
husband-manager.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
British Tobacco Co. (Aust.), Ltd.
T ively competition, whipped - up,
' largely, by a comparative newcomer
to the Australian scene, returned to the
local cigarette-market with something of
a bang about three years ago, and,
although trading conditions have rarely
been more competitive than they are to-
day, the leading manufacturers look like
setting an even hotter pace over the next
few years.
In defending its huge share of the
market last term, British Tobacco appears
to have shed a little in the way of tax-
able earnings (a record net figure is
claimed), but, all things considered, the
big co. has, so far, withstood the vigorous
blast of competition reasonably well.
Clear of most of the plant- and leaf-
problems which at times forced it to
adopt a rather passive role in the face
of changing conditions, British Tobacco
is now out to make-up whatever leeway
it lost as a result of these difficulties
through the advent of the “king-size”
filter-tipped cigarette, and is currently
expanding and reorganising its manufac-
turing-units. The much smaller Roth-
mans of Pall Mall (Australia), Ltd.,
having firmly and successfully established
itself as B.T.’s chief rival, is also planning
to lift output, and gives no sign of being
content with its present share of the
market, while Godfrey Phillip Holdings,
Ltd., and International Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., aim to strengthen their position by
merging their manufacturing interests in
a new co. to be styled Godfrey Phillip
International Pty.
Meanwhile, an obliging public promises
to accommodate the major contestants,
to some extent, by consuming a steadily
increasing amount of tobacco, on both
an absolute and per capita basis, almost
51-million pounds-weight of tobacco
going up in smoke last year (at 5.241 b.
per head of population) compared with
46.8-million pounds (5.161 b. per head) in
1954-55.
One of the largest Australian cos., in
terms of paid capital, B.T. reckons
its gross annual turnover at over £lOO
million, large factories in Sydney and
Melbourne supplying close to four-fifths
of the total demand for tobacco and
cigarettes. In preparation, possibly, fot
some private fund-raising, the co. re-
vealed a little more of its financial
strength last term by unearthing
£1,334,374 of surplus provisions (of an
unstated variety), and, judging from
recent tax-provisions, has by no means
scraped the bottom of the barrel.
A holding co., in which the U.K.-
registered British-American Tobacco Co.
holds a substantial but minority interest,
B.T. has as. its principal subsidiary
W.D. & H.O. Wills (Aust.), Ltd., other
members of the group including British-
Australasian Tobacco Co. Pty., Carreras,
Ltd., and S. T. Leigh and Co. Pty.
Ardath, Craven “A,” Capstan, Turf,
Hallmark, Havelock and Monopole are
among the group's best-known brand-
narnes.
Since 1950 B.T.’s output of cigarettes
has risen by nearly 200 p.c., and its
overall production by 74 p.c., share-
holders putting-up £4,016,543 in share-
capital and £2,008,272 in premiums in the
six years to 1953 to provide part of the
funds called for by the various expan-
sion projects. Another £4,000,000 was
raised on 6 p.c. notes in 1955, and shortly
before the beginning of last term
simultaneous par (one-for-four) and
bonus (three-for-20) issues lifted paid
capital by £5,348,244 to £20,447,308, of
which total £1,710,588 is in 64 p.c. prefs.
Four interim ord. divs. are paid each
term, the div.-rate, steady at 10 p.c. for
the past five years, averaging a little
under 9.2 p.c. over the last decade.
The co. keeps its actual turnover to
itself, but, according to chairman T. J. N.
Foley, group-sales of cigarettes were not
“adversely affected” by the strenuous
competition encountered last term. How-
ever, although offset to some extent by
improved manufacturing-efficiency, higher
leaf-prices, greater selling-expenses and
the overall cost of establishing the new
Hallmark “filter kings” on the market
appear to have trimmed pre-tax earnings,
which, after providing £549,921 (up
£81,702) for depreciation, slipped by
£86,456 to £4,529,234. As is customary,
the tax-provision was more than adequate
to cover the apparent tax-liability, but,
at £1,952,683, was down £107,436 on
the previous provision, to leave net profit
£20,980 stronger at a record
£2,576,551 :

•After deducting' outsiders’ interests, t Subject to
intangibles, £3,995,759 at 30/6/’5B.
In the published accounts additions to
reserves (including provision for plant-
replacement) are charged against earn-
ings, and, on this basis, last term’s show-
ing was up £384,121 at £2,006,971.
Transfers to reserves from earnings
dropped by £367,065, the previous term’s
£350,000 for increased plant - renewal
costs being replaced by the transfer of
£150,000 from the surplus provisions
mentioned earlier.
Calculated after deducting the (un-
changed) amount attributable to outside
shareholders, the £2,576,551 profit
covered the pref. div. and 13.1 p.c. on
an ord. capital increased by almost a
third towards the close of the preceding
year. The earning-rate rose from 14.1
p.c. to 16.3 p.c. in the 1956 term, and
to 16.9 p.c. (on average capital) in the
1957 term
By law, Australian cigarettes must con-
tain not less than 15y p.c. of locally-
grown leaf, and loose-tobacco blends not
less than 16} p.c., these proportions rising
to 22 p.c. and 234 p.c., respectively, next
July. Most of the local leaf comes from
Queensland, and, in view of the steadily
increasing quantities used, B.T. is press-
ing ahead with plans for developing a
45-acre factory-site bought, last year,
in the Brisbane suburb of Sunnybank.
Priority is also being given to the re-
arrangement and extension of manufac-
turing facilities in Sydney and in con-
junction with these changes the co. plans
to erect a multi-story office-building in
Sydney’s Macquarie Street to house its
Australian headquarters. In Adelaide a
22-acre property has been purchased as
a “future factory-site.”
In addition, the carton-, container-
and printing-offshoot, S. T. Leigh and
Co., aims to develop its general trade
in printing, canisters, etc., now that it
has caught up with group demands, and
is extending its activities to cover the
extrusion of aluminium.
To assist in financing the immediate
expansion of manufacturing-capacity and
the heavier stocks associated with an
anticipated increase in output, B.T. has
recently arranged for the private issue
of £1,500,000 of 7} p.c. notes through
J. B. Were and Son, who handled the
1955 note-issue in a similar fashion.
Apart from the sizeable additions to
visible reserves, the main balance-sheet
movements last term were also largely
concerned with fixed assets and stocks,
£719,438 going into plant, £322,372 into
freeholds (before depreciation in both
cases), and an extra £1,344,261 into
stocks, which, at balance date, accounted
for over 75 p.c. of all tangible assets.
The transfer of surplus provisions was,
presumably, an important factor in the
small (£164,452) increase in outside
liabilities and provisions and the
£1,205,415 improvement in the current-
asset surplus (£24,143,869). Debts other
than trade - debts (down £46,783) were

The Keenly-fought contest in various
sectors of the cigarette market may well,
as the chairman forecast, “cause some
variations in the sales-figures of indi-
vidual brands,” but the big co., secure
in its status as the largest manufacturer
in the industry, is now in a sound posi-
tion both to meet and offer vigorous
competition.
At the same time, shareholders may
have to be satisfied with their present
return for a time yet, while the scrip,
traditionally among the leading stocks
on Australian ’Changes, is now subject
to the minor reservations made by the
sharemarket regarding the possibility of
a link between smoking and lung-cancer.
At 365. 6d. the ords. would return
£5 9s. 7d. p.c. from a 10 p.c. div. —
a better yield than that available
from many leading stocks —the less-
frequently traded “B” ords. return-
ing an interesting £6 Is. 2d. p.c. at 335.
Net tangible cover at October 31 last
was ords. 255. 9d. and “B” ords. ss. 9d.
Hardie Trading, Ltd.
"Exhaustion of the share - premium
reserve, out of which shareholders
had collected a one-for-10 bonus-hand-
out in each of the last four years, hasn’t
detracted to any great extent from the
investment-appeal of ord. scrip in Hardie
Trading, Ltd.
A member of the successful Hardie
group of cos., the Victorian-registered
merchant and manufacturer let the public
into its 70-year-old business towards the
end of 1945. Since then the co. has
accumulated an impressive pile of re-
serves and sent out ord. divs. at an
average rate of 11.5 p.c., p.a., while, over
the last five years, it has kept the earning-
rate hovering around 30 p.c. on a slowly-
increasing ord. capital and the div.-rate
at 124 p.c., leaving well over half of
the net-profit available for reinvestment
in the business.
Although the upward movement of
earnings has been checked on several
occasions, a wide spread of interests has
given the co. a degree of protection
against variations in sectional trading-
conditions and, while there seems to be
little opportunity for a big improvement
in the current term, the maintenance of
earnings at somewhere around last term’s
figure shouldn’t prove too difficult a task.
As might be expected, on present-day
market-values, the f.-p. £1 ords. would
return a rather unexciting (£4 4s. 9d.
per cent.) yield from a 12| p.c. div.
at last week’s price of 595., but the
possibilities of improving on this return,
sooner or later, are indicated by an
earnings-yield (on last term’s showing)
of over 10.2 p.c.
Last year’s one-for-10 bonus-issue
raised ord. capital to £679,334, another
£150,060 in 5 p.c. prefs. taking the total
on the share-register to £829,394.
Through branches and subsidiaries in
all Australian States and New Zealand,
Hardie Trading handles a variety of
imported and locally-manufactured lines
ranging from textile- and tanning-
machinery, industrial chemicals, dyestuffs,
etc., to supplies for the engineering,
textile and papermaking industries. The
parent co., itself, is primarily an im-
porter and merchant, although it turns-
out leather transmission-belting and other
products allied to its merchandising in-
terests, the main manufacturing-offshoots
and associates being:
Spartan Paints Pty., maker of paints,
enamels, varnishes, ete. Operates factories
in all States except Tasmania.
Li. Horscroft Pty., largest producer of
dry - cleaning and industrial - laundry
machinery in Australia.
James Hardie Trading Co. Pty., manu-
facturer of ca'r-polislies, rubbing com-
pounds and adhesives. Also carries on a
merchandising business similar to that of
the parent co.
Proud Bros. Pty., manufacturer of
foun dry-facings.
Australian Bobbins Pty. (half-interest),
largest Australian manufacturer of
wooden bobbins for the textile trades.
Peeo-Ha'rdie Pty. (minority interest),
formed in association with Projectile and
Engineering C'o. Ltd. (U.K.), to produce
injection-moulding machines previously
imported by Hardie Trading.
In New Zealand, Hardie Trading Co.
(N.Z,), Ltd., acts as a selling-agent for
the group’s manufacturing interests, and
is also active as a distributor of indus-
trial raw-materials and machinery.
Import-restrictions are at present
hindering the progress of the N.Z. off-
shoot, but the essential nature of many
of the group’s imported lines has, in
the past, prevented any drastic curtail-
ment of imports into Australia, while
additions to the range of locally-
manufactured products have contributed
to the steady improvement in turnover.

If an overprovision for tax in the pre-
ceding term is taken into account the
improvement in declared earnings would
be only £1594, but, against this, the latest
tax-provision suggests a much greater
advance, and at £167,197, was £17,136
above the adjusted provision for the
preceding term. Provision for deprecia-
tion was £3199 higher at £75,424.
Over the past four years, extensions
to factories, etc., and the purchase of
freeholds (the group owns 21 of the 26

without disturbing the comfortable

Lincoln Mills (Aust.), Ltd.
the opening weeks of
the 1958-59 wool-selling
season, it needed no consulta-
tion with Old Moore to fore-
see that the customary stock-
pilers of raw wool, and wool
products were in for a rugged
time.
Even so, the magnitude of
Lincoln’s net trading loss —
£136,718 in 1957-58—was an
unexpected blow for share-
holders. But the real measure
of the loss depends, in the long-
run, on whether or not the co.
is able to maintain its turnover
at the old rate, and at former
selling-prices. If it can, thedoss
is in part only a book-entry
resulting from stock-revalua-
tion.
it depends on the price—-
and rate —at which raw wool
can be processed and sold.
Lincoln Mills is a Victorian
spinner and knitter, which
supplements the output of its
main Coburg (Melbourne) mill
with that of branches in pro-
vincial Victoria. The range
includes worsted-yarns, and
yarns spun from wool-synthetic
blends, nylon hosiery and
knitted goods.
The mill, adroit in its navi-
gation of the Scylla of 1951,
toppled right into the Charybdis
of 1958, even though the
second major post-war crash
of wool-prices was much less
violent, percentage-wise, than
the first.
In 1951-52, the board’s
divination of the course of the
wool-market saved the day-
stocks of raw and processed
material were whittled-down in
anticipation of the coming
slump, and the visible fall in
earnings was comparatively
slight.
Last year, unfortunately,
history failed to repeat itself,
and the greater part of the
loss was due to the necessity
of writing-down inventories to
accord with the lower price
of wool. Wool prices at Sep-
tember 30 last, Lincoln’s
balance-date, had declined 40
p.c. over the year.
The loss, taken into account
after a steady £68,392 had
been charged for depreciation,
was easily the biggest on record
and the first since 1928. In
fact, the four losing years
apart from the last together
cost the company no more than
£5094. But, in the early days,
the going was very mediocre,
the £400,000 of 9 p.c. prefs.
a heavy charge for a struggling
company, and the ordinary-
shareholders had to wait from
1922, when Lincoln was regis-
tered, until 1934 for a maiden
dividend. In the meantime,
they had lost 80 p.c. of their
capital in a drastic reconstruc-
tion.
Thereafter came a rapid
change in Lincoln’s fortunes,
accelerated by war-time con-
tracts. The 4s. ord. shares
were written-up to Bs. by a one-
for-one bonus in 1950, and
the following year 816,235 Bs.
ords. —one-for-one pref. or
ord. —were meted-out at par to
shareholders.
Of £350,000 of 5 p.c.
redeemable prefs. issued in
1950 to Colonial Mutual Life,
there still remains £150,000, to
be amortised by June, 1960.

Before this latest setback,
the company had been doing
rather well ; the ratios of profit
for the ordinaries to ordinary
capital were 17.9, 21.5,
17.7, 24.4 and 15 p.c. back to
1953. Dividend policy has,
however, tended to be con-
servative.
Mainly because of the loss,
but also because of a further
£65,000 outlaid on plant
modernisation, working-capital
showed-up £218,981 lighter at
£829,298. The ords. lost a
fair slice of their cover during
the year, but when the books
were closed, there was still
21s. 3d. in net tangibles for each
Bs. of equity capital. Quite
a large part of this backing
stems from a £474,712 surplus
on revaluation of freeholds in
1956-57:

The sharemarket, ignoring
the question of assets, looks
to income prospects in pricing
the scrip. Latest offers by
buyers and sellers tend to be
divergent, with 6s. 6d. look-
ing the logical price for the
ords. No yield can be given,
for a dividend seems unlikely
in the current year. Much
depends on the course of the
wool-market, the severity of
the coming winter, and the
level of spending - power
generally.
Lennons Hotel, Ltd.
T osses in associated cos. and
*- J a cut in the div.-rate
(from 15 p.c. to 10 p.c.) caused
a sharp fall in bids for the
ords. in Lennons Hotel, Ltd.,
last year, the £1 shares selling
down to 265. 3d. last October,
compared with 355. 6d. a year
earlier.
However, subsequent rumors
of a take-over bid (since dis-
counted), a half-yearly state-
ment reporting record pre-tax
earnings and, of more im-
mediate interest, the restora-
tion of the 15 p.c. div.-rate with
this week’s interim payout,
have strengthened sharemarket
interest and, after reaching a
“high” of 40s. in January, the
scrip is currently selling at
around 375.
Assuming that the higher
div.-rate is confirmed when the
final div. comes around, and,
if takeover bids are definitely
out, it seems most unlikely that
the board would have raised,
the interim rate unless there
was a good chance of holding
to it, the yield at 375. would
be a satisfactory £8 2s. 2d. p.c.
Lennon’s chief asset, the
well-known Lennons Hotel,
Brisbane, was rebuilt in 1941
and, with the addition of a big
new wing completed early last
term, is now the largest
licensed hotel in Australia.
Completion of the new wing
increased the hotel's capacity
by approximately 70 p.c. and
marked the end of an expan-
sion programme undertaken by
the co. not long after it pur-
chased Lennons Hotel from
the City Mutual Life in 1947.
To help meet the cost of the
new building and substantial
investments in cos. formed to
operate hotels at Broadbeach,
Kirra and Toowoomba,

capital with a one-for-one par
issue in 1955, followed this up
with a £300,000 mortgage-
loan from the City Mutual,
and in June, 1957, issued
500,000 £1 7 p.c. notes of
which 250,000 are convertible
into ords. at par in 1962. Ord.
capital now totals £470,000 and
pref. capital, £150,000, in 1\
p.c. prefs., the pref. rate being
increased from 5 p.c. in 1956.
One of the co.’s main
problems springs from the fact
that, at present, the Brisbane
hotel is carrying the whole of
the interest and dividend
charges arising from the added
share- and loan-capital. And,
at this stage, there seems little
likelihood of an early return
from the £413,276 of share-
capital invested in the three
associated cos. The big hotel is,
no doubt, capable of carrying
the load, but this hardly adds
anything to shareholders’ pros-
pects in the next couple of
years.
Lennons Broadbeach and
Kirra hotels, both on Queens-
land’s South (“Gold”) Coast,
have yet to show a profit and
reported increased losses for
the half-year to December 31
last, the Toowoomba pub, in
Queensland’s second city, con-
verting a heavy loss into a
“small” profit over the same
period.
[Lennons Hotel, Ltd., holds a
shade under 50 p.c. of the share-
capital in the Broadbeach and
Toowoomba cos. and a controlling-
interest in the Kirra co. In
1957-58, Broadbeach showed a loss
of £30,509, Toowoomba a loss of
£22,631 and Kirra a loss of £1687.|
With the new wing in full
use for less than 11 months of
the year, Lennons wrote net
profit £8037 stronger, last
term, at £90,107, after meeting
note-issue expenses and
interest of approximately
£39,624 (nil previous year) and
providing £50,000 (down £2500)
for tax and £20,394 (up
£12,380) for depreciation. In
calculating the tax-provision,
allowance was made for
previous overprovisions (total-
ling £9070) to the extent of
£2682:

representing 16.9 p.c. on ord.
capital compared with 19.4
p.c. and 25 p.c. on the lower
average capitals employed in

respectively. Last used in
1953, the 10 p.c. div.-rate
followed three years at 15 p.c.
and one (1954) at 12| p.c.
The liquor-licence was
valued during the year by a
“recognised expert” and
brought into the accounts at
£150,000, a figure said to be
well below the actual valu-
ation. The entry raised revalu-
ation reserve to £375,965 and
total reserves to £582,058, of
which £50,000 has been ear-
marked as a provision for
note-redemption. After de-
ducting intangibles, including
the liquor licence, reserves
increased by a net £12,396.
Capital expenditure (£160,410
on freeholds and a net
£167,770 on plant, etc.,) swal-

vances to associated cos.,
accompanied by a £196,299
increase in the share-invest-
ment in these cos., leaving

Judging by the scale of the
interim div., the financial
position has improved in the
current year, and the next
accounts should show a further
advance in earnings. Never-
theless, with £250,000 due for
conversion into ords. in 1962,
and a like amount due for
repayment at the same date,
shareholders’ chances of im-
proving their position appear
to hinge, largely, on the pro-
gress, or otherwise of the
Broadbeach, Toowoomba and
Kirra hotels.
Net tangible cover for the
ords. at June 30 last was

“Was it a big ‘spear-fish’
and was it harpooned or
washed ashore or . , . ?”
No, it was a valu (tuna),
and Finau caught it by troll-
ing with a very long line and
big steel hook, using a whole
big mullet for bait.
1 had seen a few tuna
hooked from inter-island
cutters, but the .heavy cotton
lines generally used by the
natives would not stand-up to
the tug-of-war methods they
Light Sft. “broom" spear used when wading.
used, and a fish of over 801 b.
was seldom boated. “Tuku
vaka !” (“Stop the boat!”) —-
certainly not, for a fish, but
we knew of one native girl who
was called Tuku-vaka because
her mother had said it very
loud and clear, with the desired
effect, shortly before the baby’s
appearance.
'T'his quick skulldragging of
a hooked fish was a relic
of the old days when barbless
and comparatively blunt hooks
of tortoise-shell and pearl-shell
were used, and a slack line
invariably meant a lost fish.
That Finau had caught that
monster on a hand-line seemed
incredible, but the story that
Lolo told me when he came,
with a small present, to visit
me a few days later, was amaz-
ing but quite convincing.
His English was much better
than my Tongan, but he was
inclined to confuse words of
somewhat similar meaning, as
in “cutting,” where he would
shave the firewood, carve the
grass or mow his lead-pencil,
so I don’t give his story
entirely in his own words.
“When I was a small baby,”
he told me, “I was ‘spoiled’
when I fell on my head, and
for a long time I was very
sick. Every day when it was
fine and calm my mother took
me down to the sea and let
me lie and play in the shallow
water. I liked to play in the
water, and it was good for me
and made me strong. 1 could
swim like fonu, the turtle, long
before I could walk, and the
other children call me Lolo
Fonu, Lolo Humpyback, Lolo
Turtle, but I am not angry
for them —I cannot run fast
like Vili Kuli (Willie Dog),
but he cannot swim and dive
like Lolo Turtle.
“Swimming every day made
my legs strong, too, and when
I was six years old I could
walk to the water but not run
yet. My father, Finau, made
me a small bobao and a little
spear, and 1 lived nearly all
the time in the bobao or in
the water.
“My big strong brother
Jione was not liking the water
very much ; when he was not
at school he was working all
the time with the things of
the carpenter, or in his garden,
and he did not want to go
fishing with Finau in the big
bobao, or in the long bonito
canoe, the tafaaga, with Finau
and my uncle, Taliai. I was
always very sorry because I
could not go, and I was very
glad on the day when I was
ten years old and Finau said,
‘Lolo-e! You want to go with
me in the bobao ?’
“That was a very big day
for me.
“T was able to walk to school
then, but every time when
Finau went on the water, and
it was not a school-day, I
would go, and he taught me the
ways of the fishes and other
things that live in the sea, and
where to look for them and
how to catch them.
“Every day there was some-
thing new to learn, and I tried
very hard, because I knew my
back would never be very
strong for heavy work, and I

knew I could be a good fisher-
man if I would try hard.
“Most days we would spear
fish in the shallow water or
along the edge of the reef in
the bay, or fish with bait for
the lazy, heavy fishes that fed
on the bottom in deeper water,
but sometimes, when the
weather was good, we would
go out to the deeper water to
look for the ika moana, the
ocean fishes that feed near the
surface and run like the wind.
“Sometimes we would go in
the tafaaga [a kayak-shaped
canoe with an outrigger], and
skim the pearlshell-lures where
we saw the sea-birds feeding
over schools of bonito. I was
not strong enough for that, but
it was good to see Finau and
Taliai with their long fish-poles
—cast, skim, heave —and the
big fish come flying through
the air to strike the men right
in the middle of their breasts
and fall off the hook into the
bottom of the canoe, and I
would drag them out of the
way with my paddle.
“Sometimes we would sail,
but we do not make canoes
for sailing now, and troll a big
pearlshell-lure or a big steel
hook with a piece of white or
red cloth or a whole fish on
it, and we caught lots of fishes
like those whose tails are on
our door at Makave —bonito,
albacore, dolphin, tuna, hapa-
tu and ono [small and large
barracuda], but only one with
a jib-boom and a sail.
“HThat was the best fish we
ever caught. It was not
so big or so strong as some
of the others, but it was very
beautiful and very clever. It
could do everything—leap like
a barracuda, shake itself in the
air like a dog when he comes
out of the water, skip across
the water and walk on its tail
like a great haku [needle-fish],
and dive down, down, down,
like the big valu.
“I was by myself in the small
bobao when I caught it. I
was sorry Finau was not with
me, because when I got the
fish alongside I did not want
to kill it. It was so brave and
so beautiful but I could not
get the hook from it—Finau’s
precious hook with its strong
mana —and I could not tow it
home alive and head-first,
because the line might break
and the hook be lost, or tail-
first, because it would drown.
“1 told him, ‘Fakamolemole,
ika eiki!’ [‘Pardon me, noble
fish!’], I very sorry I have to
kill you,” and I killed him with
the knife.
“But I was not sorry for the
big vain. He had lived a long
time, and it was better for him
to die that way than to be torn
to pieces by a great tenifa when
he was a motu’a kui [an old
blind one].
“Tt was the day before I was
A fourteen years old, a very
good day with a small wind
and no waves, only the slow
rise and fall of the long,
smooth hills of water, follow-
ing one another all day long
from the ‘islands out of sight’
—Tuamotu, Tahiti, Tubuai —-
a real blue day of lanu lagi
and lanu moana [sky color and
ocean color] when Finau and
1 went in the heavy, wide
bobao to troll in the deep
water outside Umuna.
“Going out through the
shallow green water we were
trolling a lure made from a
piece of lei [whale-tooth ivory],
a steel hook and a bunch of
red-and-white feathers, and as
we rounded the point a barra-
cuda came up from his place
above a big rock where he is
king of the castle and took it.
He was not very big, and he
was soon lying in the bobao
with his throat cut: a live ono
is no good in a small boat.
“There were no more bites
before we got to the very deep
water, where Finau took off
the lure and tied on the turn-
ing thing—l can’t say its name
—at the end of the thin, strong
wire-rope of the big hook, and
he ‘made’ a mullet on the hook
so it would swim behind us
like a hurt fish.
“Finau did not fish like the
other men with a very thick
short line, of forty or fifty
fathoms; his line was very
thin but very strong ; it would
carry Finau and it was three-
hundred fathoms long. You
cannot buy that kind of line
on the beach, but Feleti [Fritz
—a German trader] can get
them from a place called Kati-
haniki [Cutty hunk!] in
Amelika....”
(Finau’s father had been all
round the world in a whale-
ship, and he learned how to
use the long fishing-line the
way they use the long, thin
whale-line. The trolling-line
was coiled in a box in the stern
of the canoe, and from there
it ran around and between two
thick, smooth ironwood pegs,
one behind the other, on the
stern. From behind the second
peg it came forward to a much
thinner peg fitting loosely in a
deep hole. It was wound three
times round that peg, which
would break with a strong
jerk. From there it went to
a small box beside the big one.
The little box held about three
fathoms of the line, which then
ran to a much thinner peg in
a hole at the end of the out-
rigger pole on the free side.
The line was wound three

which was just strong enough
to take the weight of the line

When a fish hit, the little peg
broke at once, and then the
fish could run three fathoms

most times it did, and it gave
Finau time to put down his
paddle and turn round on his
seat to work the line.) . . .
“Tt was good that morning to
paddle up and down in
the deep blue water, well off
the shore of Umuna, riding
high on the big swell tiil we
could see Vava’u and all the
small islands for many miles,
and then sinking down in
valleys of the sea till there was
nothing to see but the tree-
tops of Umuna, and sea and
sky with a few small clouds
like the white balls of the
cotton-tree.
“We saw flying-fish leaping
and flocks of birds feeding
around us, but we did not try
to catch-up with them, as the
bobao was too heavy and slow.
“The sun was high in the
sky, and we had just started
to paddle again after stopping
to drink a coconut, when the
small peg on the outrigger-
pole beside Fipau broke off
with a crack!
“Finau swung round as the
second peg broke with a strong
jerk, and the line began to
run out between the two big
pegs on the stern. Finau
picked up the bailing-shell and
poured water on the coiled line
between his feet [knees?]
before he took hold of it. The
skin of his hands was very
hard, but the dry line could
burn them very badly. The
fish ran about fifty fathoms,
and then went up, up into
the air higher than the top of
this house. He was so big that
he frightened me and Finau
called out, ‘Oiaue ! Koe ika a
Maui!’ ”
(That was a slight exaggera-
tion, as the traditional Ika a
Maui —fish of Maui—is the
North Island of New Zealand,
which that famous Polynesian
demigod is said to have hauled
up from the ocean depths.)
“When the fish was in the
air Finau made another turn
of the line round the stern peg
to check the run-out, and after
the fish hit the water with a
great splash it went down,
down, down, till I thought it
would break its head on the
bottom.
“As ‘the wave rose to the
prow’ Finau moved back
towards the bow, with the line
running out through his hands,
and held as tightly as he could
without burning himself or
breaking the line, but I think
it would pull him overboard
before it would break.
“ M ° RE than half the line was
out, and the fish must
have been very close to the
bottom before it stopped.
“Then Finau went back and
nearly dragged the stern of the
canoe under as he took in line
until we must have been nearly
above the fish. Then the line
went slack, and Finau said,
‘A ue ! I think he is gone, and
my good hook. We snail soon
see.’
“We soon saw, when, like
shooting of gun, up it came
between canoe and outrigger
log! The canoe rocked and
shipped a lot of water, and I
was very afraid.
“Up into the air it went, five
fathoms or more ; its great eye
flashed and its strong jaws
snapped at the wire above the
hook.
“Down it came again nearly
on top of us, with a great
splash that rocked the bobao
till I thought it would capsize,
and sent a lot more water
aboard. My belly felt very
empty, but it was the dry
land that I was hungry for.
“Finau called to me to
swing the bobao so that we
would be ready for its next
run, and then I bailed as quick
as I could while he put more
turns of line around the pegs,
and it went from them around
the outrigger-pole.
“'TThe fish was going down
again— not so deep or so
steep this time, but on a long
slant. Nearly all the line was
gone, and Finau had called to
me to sit right up on the bow
and hold tight to the outrigger-
pole, when the fish broke water
straight astern, and went off
just below the surface.
“Finau would not give it
any more line, and the out-
rigger-pole bent and creaked
as the canoe went on, on, on,
like a little benzine-steamer
[a motor-boat]. Perhaps after
one half-hour it began to slow-
down, and Finau began to
haul-in line again.
“Then the fish stopped run-
ning away and began to go
round in a big ring, while I
was turning the canoe to face
him.
“Then he stopped and disap-
peared, but the line was slack,
and Finau was hauling in
quickly.
“Then the fish appeared
again, about twenty yards
away on the clear side of the
bobao, and came charging at
us like a great wild pig of
Late. Oiaue ! 1 was too much
afraid.
“Finau grabbed the heavy
spear and yelled to me to swing
the canoe. He could not throw
the spear before the fish struck
the canoe, but he was able to
drive it in deep before he was
sent flying like a bird, to fall
across the outrigger - log,
loosening one of the supports
and nearly filling the canoe
with water again.
“Finau was holding on to the
log with his legs while he
worked to fix the support, and
he called to me to get into
the water and bail before the
canoe would sink.
“While we were busy, the
fish made its last run. It went
like a racehorse for about
thirty fathoms, dragging me
along on my back and nearly
drowning me while I held onto
the pole; but it stopped in
time, and when I climbed back
into the bobao I saw that it
had stopped swimming and
was lying on its side with the
spear sticking up in the air.
“"Cinau finished fixing the out-
■*- rigger, came back into
the bobao, and hauled in all
the slack line while I paddled
slowly up to the fish.
“It had turned over and
Finau could not reach the
spear, but he put a noose in
the anchor-rope and over its
tail, and pushed the blade of
his big knife between the bones
of its back, behind its head.
Then we worked it round be-
tween the canoe and the out-
rigger-log, and lashed it, head
and tail. I knew it was dead,
but I did not like that big head
so close to me, with its great
dead eye staring at me.
“It was good that the big
tenifa [great white shark] did
not smell the blood as we
paddled slowly home, but only
a big barracuda that we could
see deep down in the water.
It would not come up close,
and we had had enough fishing
for one day, so we did not try
to hook it, and it went away
when we came to the shallow
water. The other barracuda
was lost; it did not have a

The Dragon of Kashmir
By
MENA ABDULLAH
and
RAY MATHEW
IT was the heat of summer,
the holiday time, and all
of us —Ama, Father, we
children —had come away
from the farm and its bare,
glazed hills. We had come to
the North Coast country, the
world near Nambucca. The
grass was green and gentle and
the blue of Krishna was every-
where ; in the sky, in the sea,
in the puddles after rain, in
every drop of water that you
held to look at. We stayed
with the Shahs.
They were nice people.
Everyone liked them, but not
really me. The children were
brave, when 1 was shy. They
were quick, when 1 was slow.
They were Australian, and not
like me. They had always had
white friends, when 1 had had
only Rashida. Rashida liked
them. Sometimes it frightened
her, the games they played, the
way they talked, but she could
do the same. She was braver
than I, she was older. It was
Grandmother Shah that I
liked.
She was old and gentle. And
I think that she was sad. She
had come to Australia from
Kashmir. She had come a
long time ago, when she was
young and Grandfather Shah
was young, too. And now he
was dead and her children
were grown, and her grand-
children were brittle with Aus-
tralian ways and Australian
talk and had no time to listen
to her. There was no one alive
who remembered her. She was
Grandmother Shah —even to
Ama, my mother, who had also
come from Kashmir.
But I listened to her. 1 asked
her questions and pestered her
to tell of the old days and the
old ways, to tell me stories of
Grandfather Shah and the days
when he trained camel-drivers
for the long rides through Aus-
tralia, stories of Kashmir and
the jewels that the Indian
maharanis wore. She scolded
me and called me a Bengali,
said that I chattered like mon-
keys, that I was wearing her
out, that I should play with the
other children and I should be
quiet—the way Kashmiri chil-
dren were quiet and should
never ask questions. But,
always, she answered me.
Only, sometimes, her answers
were so long and so slow, so
full of memories that she
seemed to forget that I was
there. She would look at me
and not see me, so that I had
to chatter again and to prod
her with words to bring her
back to the story. I had to call
her Grandmother to make her
look at me.
She was not my grand-
mother. She was not related
to my family at all, except by
friendliness.
■poß friendliness, or to keep
me quiet, she let me look
through the old cardboard-
boxes that held her memories
—ribbons and letters, photo-
graphs and brooches. We were
in the garden. Grandmother
Shah sat in her chair in the
shade of the tamarind tree and
crocheted. I sat on the grass
near her and went through one
of the boxes.
It was a warm day, but nice
and lazy, and I pulled the old
things out tiredly and looked
at them as though looking was
a very hard job. T was watch-
ing how slowly my hand
moved when I was lifting them
—the envelopes with their
faded stamps and the letters
covered with writing in Hindi.
It was then, under a heap
of letters, that I found the
fan.
It was old. Some of the
sticks were broken. But it was
silk, and big. It was bright
but faded. I opened it and
fanned myself like an Indian
lady or a maharani. But it
was full of dust that made me
sneeze. So, sneezing, and
laughing, and chattering like
a monkey, I jumped up and
dropped it on Grandmother
Shah’s lap, on her crochet-
work. She did scold me then.
1 had made her white work
dirty. 1 was stupid and
thoughtless. I was Australian
and not well-bred. And what
was I doing with a filthy old
fan?
“But, Grandmother, it’s
yours. It was in your box.
Wasn’t it yours? Who did it
belong to? Did she have a
story? Can you remem-
ber . . . ?”
Grandmother Shah had
brushed the fan to the ground,
but now she p'icked it up and
looked at it. She looked for a
long time. I was bored.
“Grandmother Shah!”
“Bring me that box. It was
in that box?”
She looked through the things
in the box, and then
pulled out an envelope that
had a photograph inside it. It
was very old and faded, but
she held it and looked at it
as if it were new. I leant on
the arm of her chair and
looked at it, too. It was very
old and faded. It was not new
at all.
It showed two girls in a
garden. They stood very close
to one another and the hems
of their saris were touching.
They both had long, black,
plaited hair and caste-marks
on their foreheads. One of
them held the fan —but it was
a new fan then.
“There’s something on it,”
I said. I opened it—the real
fan—and looked hard at the
faded silk. “It’s a dragon.”
“The dragon of Kashmir,”


said Grandmother. “I remem-
ber it now.” She took the
open fan from me, and held it.
“It was bright green then, and
the dragon was silver. It was
not the kind of fan that a
young girl should have.”
“Did you know them,
Grandmother, the girls in the
picture?”
“That one is me,” she said.
“That was when I was Farida,
and not Grandmother. That
was when I was fourteen, and
not here. That was in
Kashmir.”
She laughed at the picture.
“They are Kashmiri roses,” she
said.
“They’re withered and
brown.”
“It is the photograph that
has withered,” said Grand-
mother Shah. “That was the
garden of our house in Kash-
mir, my father’s house. I
remember it all now ; the day
the photograph was taken. It
was my brother. He had come
back from Oxford, from the
big school there. He had come
back the night before. He
was wearing English clothes.
He forgot to take off his shoes
at the door. He was like a
stranger, but he was still ours.
And in the morning he said
I will photograph you all. But
we didn’t know what that
meant and we thought that
photographed might be like —
baptised, or vaccinated, or
something nasty. And then he
came out of the house with
the box on legs and he made
us all stand still and look at
it. He said that we would see
a bright-yellow bird. But we
did not. None of us did.”
“The other girl is holding
the fan.” I knew all about
photographs.
“It is hers,” said Grand-
mother Shah. “We were both
fourteen, Lala and 1.”
“"You’re smiling,” I said.
“You’re smiling in the
photograph, and now, too.”
“We were both fourteen.
We thought that wonderful
things would happen.”
“And didn’t they? You
came to Australia.”
“1 came to Australia,” said
Grandmother Shah. “But I
never wanted to go away. I
wanted to be home. I wanted
to be married with children, a
house with servants and the
people that I knew. Lala is
the one that should have come
away. She wanted never to
stay at home. She was very
clever and wild. She could
read and write like a man.
She used to say ... I remem-
ber jhow she used to tell me
about countries a long way
off, where women walked like
men. I used to say to her, ‘The
woman is the sole of the hus-
band’s foot.’ It made her
angry. Every time, it made
her angry. 1 said it to her that
morning. ‘My brother is
home,’ I said. ‘He is very
fierce and white and handsome.
He will make you want to be
the sole of his foot.’ ”
“Did he?”
“No. Yes. She was very
shy with him. Perhaps she
loved him. She was shyer
every day. Every day we saw
him. She was my great friend,
but she was the one who
talked. She was very grown-
up. She used to talk no matter
who was in the room ; even if
there were real adults there,
even if there were men. But
when my brother came into
the room, she was quiet. All
that summer she carried this
fan. It was not the kind of
fan that a young girl should
have had, but it had been her
mother’s before it was hers.
I remember now, when he was
there, how slowly she used it;
how she held it almost to hide
her face. And the next year,
1 came to Australia to be mar-
ried and Lala came with her
father to the ship.”
“Did she give you the fan
then? As a present?”
“I cannot remember. I
remember how I cried and how
she told me that I was silly, a
child ; that I should be proud
to be free and going away,
even if it did mean that I had
to be married and become
nothing.”
“Was your brother there?”
“He was there. With his
wife.”
“Was Lala his wife?”
“Oh, Nimmi, child. Noth-
ing wonderful ever happens,
ever.”
“Did she get married?”
“Who should she marry?
She was more clever than any
man in Kashmir. Her father
used to let her help him. She
would never have been Grand-
mother, and not Lala.”
“Is she dead, then?”
looked at the
photograph. “We were
fourteen then,” she said. “We
are both dead now. I am
Grandmother Shah and no one
remembers Farida. She is as
old as I am and she has never
left Kashmir.”
“But I remember you!”
“You remember what I tell
you, and that is all you will
remember.”
I waved the fan, slowly,
almost hiding my face. I
peeped at Grandmother Shah.
“Do I look like Lala?” I said.
But Grandmother was look-
ing at the photograph with its
brown, faded flowers in Kash-
mir, and its brown, faded faces.
“Why do they have dragons
on Kashmiri things?” I was
peering at the design on the
fan.
“Because they eat everything.
Because they live forever.”
She put the photograph
down on the ground and picked
up her crochet-work.
“If she didn't give you the
fan —then, you ought to send
it back.”
“Stop chattering, child.”
The wind picked at the
photograph. I moved to
grab it.
“Let it go,” said Grand-
mother. Almost, she shouted,
“Let it go!”
And the two of us sat there,
as though it were again, and
watched the wind lift the
photograph and then drop it,
tug it and push at it, lift it
and lever it till suddenly it
went up high, high, and
whirled around in the sky that
was as blue as Khrishna.
“It will blow away,” I said.
“You will never see it again.”
“The dragon will eat it,”
said Grandmother Shah. She
went back to her crochet-work.
THE HOLLIDAYS
“Next time I’ll look after the tickets!”


Australia's Next-door Neighbor
WEST NEW GUINEA
Obscurity on the subject of Dutch
New Guinea isn’t confined to the
wording of the Casey-Subandrio
agreement. Apart from knowing
that the controversial territory is the
western end of the island that includes
Papua and the former Mandated Terri-
tory, the average Australian knows very
Tttie about the region. During World
War II tens of thousands of servicemen
became familiar with various parts of the
Australian territory, but, apart from a
tiny force at Merauke on the swampy
south coast and airmen who touched-
down at Hoilandia and Biak in the north,
very few saw any part of Dutch New
Guinea.
For that matter very few Dutchmen
saw it, either. In pre-war days the white
population numbered only a few hundred,
which is not surprising, as in comparison
with other parts of Holland’s East
Indian empire it was unproductive
territory, poor in natural resources.
At its western tip Dutch New Guinea
almost touches the equator in the longi-
tude of Darwin ; it stretches 750 miles
east to the 141st meridian, the boundary
of Australian territory, north of Cape
York Peninsula. Including adjacent
islands, it covers an area of about 160,000
sq.-miles, with an estimated population
of 700,000, of whom about 360,000 are in
areas which have been brought under
administration ; the rest are in the mostly
unpatrolled and largely unexplored
mountainous interior.
The white population at the end of
1957 was 16,689, about half of them in or
near Hoilandia, and with other sizeable
white communities at Biak (in the
Schouten Islands), Sorong and Manok-
wari on the Vogelkop Peninsula, the
“bird's head” protuberance at the
western end of the territory, and
Merauke. There are also about 17,000
Asians, the chief aggregations being in
the Sorong and Merauke districts.
Historic Claims
A lthough New Guinea was visited by
Portuguese navigators as early as
1526 and the Dutch claimed a shadowy
overlordship not long afterwards and
effectively kept other European Powers
out of the area, it was not until 1828
that Holland officially took possession
of the land by proclamation. This
followed rumors that a British settle-
ment was to be established on the
south coast. Earlier the Dutch had
been content with such sovereignty
as attached to the Dutch East India
Company by virtue of a centuries-
old treaty with the potentates of three
small islands in the Moluccas, which
acknowledged the company to be “lord
of the Papuans or all their islands
which are subject to the king
of Tidore.” On two of these
subject islands, Misol and Salwatti,
adjacent to Vogelkop, were chiefs who
claimed paramountcy over parts of the
New Guinea mainland, so that the Dutch,
through the company, became at two re-
moves the suzerains of an indefinite
length of New Guinea coastline.
When in the 1880's Britain and
Germany staked claims in the eastern por-
tion of New Guinea the boundary be-
tween their colonies and that of Holland
was fixed at the 141st meridian (with a
minor adjustment along the course of the
Fly River). Towards the end of last
century Holland established adminis-
tration-posts on the north coast, and,
in 1902, at Merauke on the south coast
(mainly to stop tribal raids across the
border into Papua).
In 1934 oil-concessions were granted
in the Sorong and Fak Fak areas, but
up to the time -of the Japanese invasion
in 1942 the drilling-parties had had no
success. In 1944 the Pacific Islands Year
Book was still able to say of West New
Guinea: “This is a forbidding land, its
coastal areas swampy, fever-ridden and
covered by almost impassable jungle;
its mountainous interior inaccessible and
as yet almost unexplored.”
Post-war Development
r T'TtE present administration of West
New Guinea was established at the
end of 1949, after the sovereignty of
the rest of the Dutch possessions in the
East had been transferred to the new
State of Indonesia. Japanese occupation
had destroyed most of the pre-war
settlements and the vast quantities of
U.S. stores and equipment left behind
had been used for rehabilitation in
Indonesia proper.
The new Administration had to start
from scratch. It had the benefit of all
the war-time advances in prevention and
treatment of tropical diseases, but, in
comparison with the Australian end of
the island, it was four years behind in
starting.
Although Dutch New Guinea is not
classed as Trust territory it is adminis-
tered along the general lines of the
United Nations requirements for the
administration of non-self-governing
territories, and reports are submitted to
the Secretary-General under the provi-
sions of Article 73 ( e ) of the U.N. Charter.
A voluminous report submitted to the
Secretary-General last year covers the
activities in the area in 1957, lists the
difficulties in the way of development and
outlines plans in progress or projected.
The major handicap which faces the
Administration is the country’s sparse
natural resources. There are no indi-
genous food animals, and the introduc-
tion of stock is hampered by the almost
complete absence of natural fodders.
At the end of 1957 a livestock census
showed almost negligible figures: cattle,
2125; pigs, 2000 ; goats, 1500; poultry,
26,000. These have mostly been imported
since the war and are intended as the
nucleus of a stock-breeding programme.
In the Highlands there are an estimated
40,000 pigs of native origin.
The Papuans have no grain-crops, and
the Administration believes the only way
to improve living-standards— at present
sago and tubers are the staple diet —is
to develop the cultivation of grain-crops.
A start has been made in the Merauke
area with a mechanised rice-growing pro-
ject. An experimental 1000-acre rice-
polder has given reasonable results, and
it is planned to extend it to 30,000 acres.
Vegetable- and fruit-growing is being
encouraged around the urban centres, and
a small start has been made on the
growing of maize and peanuts ; copra-
production, low in comparison with the
rest of New Guinea, is expected to in-
crease, and encouragement is being given
to the cultivation of cocoa (pods have
been procured from Australian New
Guinea), coffee, rubber, nutmeg and
cloves. Most of these are still in the
experimental stage ; the task of accus-
toming the native mind to a system of
cash-crops instead of subsistence-farming
is a difficult one.
Education and Training
■poß this reason the main emphasis at
present is on education—in the training
of selected Papuans to train their fellow-
villagers. The aim is to put village-
farming on a more substantial basis by
combining the cultivation of food-crops
(mainly for the family’s own consump-
tion) with the growing of perennial cash-
crops, and later, annual cash-crops, stock-
and poultry-raising.
In the field of formal education there
were at the end of 1957, including
mission schools, some of which have
been operating in the area for two or
three generations, 1132 schools with
about 50,000 pupils and 1670 teachers.
In addition to basic education there are
schools for training natives in farming,
forestry and health services ; a training-
centre for indigenous administrative
officers, a police-training school and a
school of elementary navigation.
Recognition of the similarity of the
problems involved in administering the
western and eastern halves of New
Guinea and the fact that both the Aus-
tralian and Netherlands Governments
intend to prepare the native population
for ultimate self-government have led
to growing co-operation between the two
Administrations. Last October a five-day
conference attended by Australian and
Dutch representatives was held in Port
Moresby with the aim of putting this
co-operation on a more formal and per-
manent basis. Further meetings are in-
tended.


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MIL RUM.
Over fo Ftemington
Melbourne racing goes next
Saturday to Flemington, where
the V.R.C. will stage the first
day of its autumn carnival.
During the four days —March
7,9, 11 and 14—the club will
distribute £54,000 in stake-
money and trophies.
Main race on the first day
will be the y ~Newmarket, worth
this year £5OOO. It dates to
1874, and in all the years since
then only Aspen (1880-81) and
Gothic (1927-28) have won it
twice. Most of our great
sprinters have won the race:
horses like Heroic, Gothic,
Aurie's Star, Ajax, All Veil,
Bernborough and Royal Gem.
King’s Fair (1.10, in 1957)
holds time-honors.
On the same programme, the
seven-furlongs Sires’ Produce
Stakes (two-year-olds) is worth
£4OOO. Last year Misting won
the Sires’, ending a run of
successes in the race by Sydney
entrants.
• • • •
The St. Leger Stakes (three-
year-olds), worth £3500, is run
over H mile. Only the Derby,
which goes back to 1855, has
a longer tradition in Victoria
than the St. Leger, first run in
1857. The mighty Tulloch
won it last year.
Main race on the Monday
(Labor Day in Melbourne)
will be the Australian Cup,
worth £4OOO, plus a £lOO
trophy. It is run over the odd
distance of two miles, one
furlong and 110yds. The dist-
ance used to be miles, but
it was altered in 1943 so that
the race could start from the
straight-six barrier. The Cup
is not a good-horse's race, and
is notorious for the number of
“roughies” that have been
successful.

Lord’s performance in last
Saturday’s Futurity Stakes at
Caulfield was something to
wonder at. The big Targui
gelding, burdened with 10.6,
did not show his usual nip
from the barrier, and at the
half-mile was in the middle of
the field. At this stage he
received a bad squeeze that all
but brought him down. By
the time Lane got him bal-
anced again the gelding was
"I think Joe's on to something .”
last and giving a smart field a
long start. Lane had to take
him around everything, and
make the turn six out from
the rails. Lord got to the
leaders at the furlong-post, had
a sharp tussle with Skyline and
Cherete, and then, over the
last little bit, drew away to
win brilliantly—a memorable
run.
Lord has now won 14 of his 26
races, to earn £19,475 stakemoney.
His score at Caulfield is nine
straight. Sydney racegoers will see
a great horse when he contests the
Chipping Norton Stakes and the
All Age Stakes.
Form in the Futurity made next
Satuiday’s Newmarket a tough one
to forecast. Skyline's second to
Lord confirmed his place as New-
market favorite, but New Spec,
who led to the furlong-post and
weakened only slightly into fourth
possie, comes down from lOst. to
8.3 and meets Skyline 171 b. better.
Third Sydneysider, Gold Stakes, is
going to be hard to beat, and the
Victorian, Merger, has a show.
The field in the rich Merson
Cooper Stakes dwindled to the
colts Goglio and Prince Lea,
the gelding Tempofino, and
the fillies Hyleena and Snow-
flower. South Australian
Goglio, with five straight wins
behind him, was sent out a
warm favorite, and landed the
money. Hi s performance,
however, fell short of his
reputation. He had to struggle
hard to beat Prince Lea nar-
rowly—the previous week
Sydney youngsters Perouse and
Travel Boy had thrashed Prince
Lea. Nor was the time —
1.11 3/10 on a lightning-fast
track —anything remarkable.
Goglio’s owner, Mrs. H. Bick-
ford, had been toying with the
idea of paying the late-fee of £lOOO
to start the colt in the Golden
Slipper Stakes, but she probably
realises that Goglio would have no
chance with Fine and Dandy and
the other good Sydneysiders.
Most of the fancied candi-
dates for the Australian Cup
were in the field for the mile-
and-a-half Woodcliff Handicap.
The winner was Gaybao, who
had been racing consistently in
recent weeks on country tracks.
With Neville Sellwood on
board, Gaybao was sent out
favorite, although his price—
-11 to 2 —indicated that the race
looked hard to pick. Sellwood
rode his usual heady style to
have the four-year-old Bilbao
gelding nicely positioned to
the turn, where he kicked him
away to an unbeatable lead.
Brisbane stayer Urgona ran on
well to take second money, and
Westralian Dawdie ran her
usual honest race to fill the
minor place.
Gaybao’s trainer, O. M. Lynch,
rather surprisingly announced that
he was doubtful about starting his
charge in the Australian Cup, hav-
ing a mind to pick easier races for
the gelding. The Cup is one of
the weakest £4OOO races in the
calendar, and Gaybao would not
meet any better opposition in that
event than he defeated on Saturday.
Punters cheered lustily as
Quitos ran past Sanvo in the
straight in the St. Clair Handi-
cap, but it was obvious to
those who watched closely
that the mare had no hope of
keeping the race. Young Des
Lake had been in trouble from
the start, where his saddle
slipped, and as he was reining
his mount in it could be seen
clearly that his saddle-bag
(carrying 101 b. of lead) was
missing. The bag had dropped
to the track about 44- furlongs
from home. Sanvo, second past
the post, would probably have
beaten the mare had she had
to carry her full weight.
Since his return from Eng-
land Jack Purtell has not had
great success, but he showed at
Caulfield that he had lost none
of his judgment. In the nine-
furlong Stanley Plate for three-
year-olds he took a good hold
on High Peal early and pulled
him back from a wide barrier
position over to the rails. With
the pace slow, High Peal was
able to lob along easily until
Purtell asked him for an effort
at the half-mile. The colt went
around the field quickly, and
as they straightened-up Purtell
drove him to a lead that was
enough to hold off the fast-
finishing Night Eyes.
High Gun ran riglit up to
his good fourth in the Oakleigh
Plate to win the six-furlongs
Hawksburn Handicap in the
smart time of 1.10-t —only |
sec. outside Astounding's
track record. Gay Saba’s
second was a good run, par-
ticularly as he was checked at
the turn. He may have some
sort of chance in the New-
market. However, it was an
all-Victorian field in the
Hawksburn, and the autumn
racing so far has shown that
the local sprinters are no
match for the Sydney visitors.
It is probable that the flourishing
state of Victorian racing will be
reflected at the annual yearling-sales,
which begin at the Royal Melbourne
Showgrounds next Friday (March
6), when the Australian Bloodstock
Agency will offer 130 youngsters.
The sales will be continued at New-
market on March 10 and 12, when
Wright, Stephenson and Co., Ltd.,
will offer 307.
Results of the 46 two-year-old
events decided in Melbourne this
season to February 21 are encourag-
ing to local breeders. Thirty-two
different youngsters have won those
races, 21 of them bred in Victoria,
nine in New South Wales and two
in New Zealand.
Tremendous interest will be
taken in this year’s crop of Orgoglio
youngsters. Not many sires are as
successful in their first season as
Orgoglio, six of whose two-year-
olds have won 18 races this season.

Sydney Horses
Resumption of racing at
Warwick Farm attracted a sur-
prisingly good attendance,
auguring well for Sydney’s
autumn meetings, which
shortly get under way. The
S.T.C.’s £lO,OOO Golden Slipper
Stakes for two-year-olds will
be staged next Saturday week
at Rosehill, with also the £l5OO
weight-for-age Rawson Stakes
and the S.T.C. Gold Cup of
£3300. At Warwick Farm on
March 21 the A.J.C. meeting
will include the Chipping Nor-
ton Stakes, run at w.f.a. over
10 furlongs.
Before racing at Warwick
Farm Bold Pilot and Skyline
were best-fancied for the
Doncaster (March 28), with
Grenoble also popular. All
three were defeated, Skyline at
Caulfield and Bold Pilot and
Grenoble in the Denham
Court Handicap at the Farm.
However, it is likely the six
furlongs of the Denham didn’t
suit either Bold Pilot or
Grenoble, and both could show
quick improvement over a
longer journey. Suitable races
for them before the Doncaster
could be the £2OOO Rosehill
Railway Quality Handicap and
Warwick Farm’s £1250 Liver-
pool Handicap, both at seven
furlongs. Grenoble has won
at six furlongs, but he favors
a distance beyond that, and
is, in fact, best suited at one
mile. Bold Pilot’s display
disappointed connections; a
short-priced favorite, he beat
only a couple home.
Noel McGrowdie, of course,
makes something of a habit
of bobbing-up in big races.
I.ast Easter he won the Don-
caster and Sydney Cup double
(Grenoble and Straight Draw),
and racing at Warwick Farm
suggested that he could very
likely repeat that performance
this month. McGrowdie had
the mount on Grenoble, fourth
and finishing fast in the Den-
ham Court Handicap to the
more speedy My Peter, who
can always run a merry six,
and the crack lightweight also
won the Warwick Handicap on
Braemar, who is likely to be
his Cup mount. Braemar
scored brilliantly with 7.9 over
the 11 furlongs; he has 7ib.
less in the Cup. He’s a four-
year-old, and that age-group
has the best record in all
important handicaps in Aus-
tralia. His sire, Balloch (imp.),
sired Dalray (Melbourne Cup),
while his dam, Cardoness, was
got by Foxbridge (imp.) from
My Own by Lord Quex. His
half-brother, The Wash, won
the Q.T.C. Derby, St. Leger
and Brisbane Cup.
Handicapped at 9.7 for the
Warwick Handicap, Melbourne
Cup winner Baystone carried
31b. less (an allowance for
apprentice G. Howard), and
though, from a rearward posi-
tion, he was still ninth for
home, he ran on strongly into
third place. A win seems close.
He won the Melbourne Cup
with 8.9, and has 9.3 in the
Sydney Cup, a solid-enough
impost, but he should be
cherry-ripe for the two miler,
in which a top group of true
stayers will face the barrier.
It should be the best Sydney
Cup in years.
* * •
Valerius (who is raced by
A.J.C. chairman A. G. Potter
and Keith Mackay) won a
Graduation Stakes at Rosehill
as a maiden last August, but
form in the meantime had been
disappointing ; he won well on
Saturday, but hadn’t very
much to beat. The progeny of
his dam, Eternal City (imp.),
have all been winners: Flames,
Prince Delville, Fort William,
Roman Holiday and Redes-
wood —a fine record. Valerius,
who cost 3700gns. as a yearling,
may now go on to much better
things—he is bred the right
way and seems an improver.
Great Blaze, runaway
winner of the Warwick Farm
Edensor Park Handicap, was
ridden by George M°ore, who
has accepted an attractive re-
tainer to ride in France and is
now on the way there, via
America. Great Blaze was his
last mount before leaving for
overseas remarkable how
often a “last mount” has been
a winner on Sydney tracks in
recent years. Moore made it
a double, having won the open-
ing event on Great Blaze’s
stablemate Wolarma.
• • • •
Wolarma, one of several
yearlings bought by T. J.
Smith in New Zealand last
year, had an easy win in the
First Juvenile Maiden for colts
and geldings. He’s by Gold
Nib (imp.) from Mons Pride
by Admiral’s Luck (imp.).
Morning Star, winner of the
Second Juvenile Maiden, is a
gelded son of Star Kingdom
(imp.) and Sweet Adeline by
Dogger Bank (imp.) from
Lady Adornment by Vaals.
Blue Pacific, easy winner of
the Warwick Three-year-old
Maiden, gave J. Thompson a
double ; he won the previous
event on Valerius. Trained by
Lou Burke for J. Lincoln, Blue
Pacific was cheap at 230gns. as
a yearling at the Randwick
auction in 1957. She is by
Damtar (Fr.) from All Blue by
Delville Wood (imp.) from
Kirrang by Magpie (imp.). A
first foal, she is from a half-
sister to Aristocrat (w.-f.-a. and
A.J.C. St. Leger winner).
Rock and Rye (imp.), a
good middle-distance per-
former in England, hasn't had
many runners, but one of them,
Gay Satin, has been pretty-
good. Another, Mistle, a
smart-looking two - year - old
filly, had an easy task in the
Maiden for that age-group at
Warwick Farm. Mistle is
from Black Signet by Agin-
court (imp.) from Mistletoe by
Psychology (imp.). Her sister,
Irish Wit, won in two-year-
old company at Canterbury
Park. Wotan (Melb. Cup) and
Gaine Carrington (Caulfield
Cup) are in the filly’s family.
Luna Park—an apt enough
naming ; she’s by Fair’s Fair
(imp.) from Holiday Scene
(imp.)—showed at the Canter-
bury Park midweek all-tote
meeting that she’s a speedy
sort. She led most of the way
in winning the Maiden for
two - year - old fillies. She’s
owned by T. Powell and N. C.
Smith, a brother of T. J. Smith,
who trains her. However, the
stable preferred the prospects
of Terrylin, who had galloped
well, but never threatened
danger. Holiday Scene, bred
in England (by Fun Fair from
Tide Time by Samphire), was
imported to Australia in 1950
by F. W. Hughes Pty., Ltd.
Raced for five owners,
Native Kingdom, a Star King-
dom gelding, cleared out with
the Third Ashbury Stakes at
Canterbury. He’s trained by
M. McCarten, who earlier in
the afternoon won the High-
weight with the brilliant two-
year-old filly Endure. She
ran record race-time, 1.11.9.
Previous holder of the record,
Clear Profit, finished third to
Endure. Winner of the A.J.C.
Gimcrack Stakes, and later a
winner at Caulfield, Endure
hadn’t raced for close on four
months.

The Trots
At Harold Park on Friday
night the first heat of the Sires’
Produce Stakes went to Amaz-
ing Vale, downing favorite
Craig Hanover by two lengths,
with last season’s champion
two-year-old, Best Ever (the
only starter from the second
line), third. Amazing Vale’s
time for the 111 fur., 3.10 j,
was ysec. faster than Eden
Monaro’s in the second heat.
The expected thrill of see-
ing two champion three-year-
olds fighting out the finish in
the second heat didn’t material-
ise. The complete eclipse of
Blue, the New Zealand cham-
pion, shocked his connections
and punters alike. After lead-
ing for the first mile, Blue col-
lapsed and finished fifth in the
field of seven. Starting favorite
at 7 to 4 on, Eden Monaro,
after being badly away, put
up a remarkable performance
to beat Big Time by a neck in
3.10 J-. Eden Monaro consoli-
dated his position as favorite
for next Saturday night’s final.
Flingo, starting favorite
from 24yds. behind in the
Harold Park Handicap, was
badly away, ran at the tail-end
until nearing the turn into the
straight; then, with a sus-
tained run, swept round

Final heats for the Inter-

Don (N.S.W.) made sure of his
place in the final by winning
the first heat of the 15T~fur-

of 4min. 15fsec. This scored
for the Don a further seven

Sheffield Shield
Before it had played its last
two games N.S.W. had won
the Sheffield Shield—for the
sixth successive year. With
Benaud, Harvey, O'Neill,
Davidson, Burke and Rorke it
had more than half the Test
side. The measure of its
strength was that players like
Booth, Carroll, Saunders,
Wyatt and Philpott could not
hold their places. Had N.S.W.
been able to enter a second
team it would probably have
won its share of matches, and
at least would have made a
game of the others.
It was N.S.W.’s ninth win
in the 13 seasons since the war,
and the third time N.S.W. has
won the Shield six times on
end.
Before the series began, S.A.
captain and former Test bats-
man Graeme Hole, at 27,
announced his retirement from
first-class cricket for business
reasons —not because of the
injury he received when bril-
liantly catching Victorian
skipper Sam Loxton in a Shield
game in Melbourne in January,
1958. (In that game he made
123, in what was his last Shield
innings.)
About the same time
Queenslander Ron Archer,
because of the knee injury
which stopped him bowling,
was announced as being a
doubtful starter in Shield games
—though he was to miss only
one, through injury, and led
Queensland against Victoria
when Lindwall was playing in
the fifth Test. Archer made
several handy scores, but
bowlfed only one or two overs
all the season, and his first-
class career seems to have
ended. His once-promising
Test career is certainly over.
A member of the Australian
team in South Africa in 1957-
58, John Drennan could not
hold his place in the S.A. team
this season.
The Shield season, despite
N.S.W.’s predominance, was
interesting, and produced a lot
of good cricket. Fortunately
the season was not curtailed,
as it was when the 1954-55
English team was here ; the
full quota of games was played.
The mangled 1954-55 Shield
season was not a success.
Several newcomers, appear-
ing for the various States,
seem likely to become fixtures
in Shield teams for some time
to come. Most interesting per-
haps is N.S.VV. left-hand bats-
man Neil Marks, who began
a successful Shield season with
180 not-out in his Shield
debut against S.A. last Decem-
ber —he was associated with
another newcomer, Graham
Thomas, in a record Shield
sixth-wicket stand of 332.
(Thomas played in a couple
of games the previous season,
but for practical purposes is
a newcomer in ’5B-59.)
Others to begin promisingly
in Shield cricket were Queens-
land opening-bat lan Oxen-
ford and W.A. opener Derek
Woodhead —Derek made 101
not-out against Queensland in
his second Shield game. Two
promising bowlers who began
this season, both fasties, are
South Australian Alan Hitch-
cox (accused of being a
“thrower”) and Victorian Colin
Guest, who is not only in his
first Shield season but also in
his first season in district-
cricket.
* * *
“K.R.”: Ano'ther Grimmett
record went the other day,
according to the papers, when
Richie Benaud, with his 3-38
against W.A., reached 78 first-
class wickets for the season —
one more than Grimmett’s 77
in 1931-32 (when South Africa
visited Australia). I can’t find
any mention of this bowling
feat in various references to
Grimmett, though, as he took
33 wickets in Tests against
S'Africa that season, it is no
doubt quite right. Ray Robin-
son, in Between Wickets,
credits Grimmett with setting
a record in 1939-40 for “most
wickets in a season’s Aus-
tralian matches—73 wickets in
nine games.”

With four catches in the
fifth Test, ’keeper Wally Grout
brought his tally for the series
of catches and stumpings to
20, to equal Tallon’s record for
a series against England, made
in 1946-47. With Tallon for
several years keeping him out
of Queensland’s side, and then
Langley and Maddocks doing
ditto as far as Australia was
concerned, it seemed that
Grout would never get the top
chance. Had Maddocks been
available for South Africa in
1957-58, Grout would probably
have missed that tour. He
went, and his practically error-
less ’keeping was a main factor
in Australia's winning of the
Test series there, as now against
England.

One or two points of note
from the first day at the Aus-
tralian athletic championships
in Hobart:
Most noteworthy effort possibly
was South Australian Nicholas
Birks’s 250 ft. javelin-throw —which
broke his own Ausuahau record by
15ft. and set a new British Empire
record.
The 440yds. was won by Kevan
Gosper; his time, 47sec., equalled
his own Australian record. Gosper
was voted “untuck jest loser in the
1956 Olympic Games” —his time in
his heat of the 400-metres, for the
final of which he d.d not qualify,
was faster than American Charles
Jenkins’s winning time in the final.
The mile was won by Merv Lin-
coln, in a slow 4.5.6, from John
Murray and Albert Thomas. Elliott
did not run. Although almost cer-
tainly the second-best miler in the
world today, Lincoln has not had
many big w'ins- —he had not pre-
viously won the Australian mile
title, as he had not, until this year,
w'on the Victorian mile. Landy
and now Elliott have barre'd his
road.
The 100yds. was won b'y young
N.S.VV. sprinter Brian Waters, with
N.S.W.'s Terry Gale second. Time,
9.9 sec. Hec Hogan, winner of the
title for the past seven successive
years (since dethroning John
Treloar in 1952) and joint-holder of
the world-record for 100yds.
(9.35ec.), did not qualify for the
final, and, at 28, his long supremacy
appears over.
Dave Power won the six-miler in
28min. 55.25ec.

hurdles in 1957 and 1958, made

son John came a creditable fourth
in the 120yds. hurdles.

ADDITIONS
THE BERLIN QUESTION
With the Soviet “ultimatum”
challenge on the West's
position in Berlin due to expire
on May 27, there has been
much speculation in overseas
papers about possible solutions
to the present deadlock.
Asking editorially “What are
the fundamentals?” New York
“Herald Tribune” answers:
“One certainty is that the
Berlin issue is only a part of
the general German question,
and that the best means for
determining the fate of Berlin
would be in the context of an
agreement on Germany as a
whole.
“This is true because the
basic Western position on all
aspects of Germany is that the
free people of that country —
whether in West Berlin or in
the Federal Republic—cannot
be surrendered to the overt or
covert threat of Communist
domination. If the whole of
Germany is unified on terms
that would provide safeguards
against such a threat, the
Berlin question would solve it-
self. But so long as West
Berlin is a free island in a Red
sea, it will require the special
protection now afforded by the
Allied garrisons.
“The Soviet notion of
German unification—which it
is not anxious to link with the
Berlin question, preferring to
chip away at the exposed
Western bastion is a loose
confederation of East and West
Germany which would preserve
the Communist institutions
Russia has imposed on the
people east of the Elbe. Keep-
ing those institutions, includ-
ing the Police State, intact
would allow progressive pene-
tration of free Germany. If
such unification were accom-
panied, as the Kremlin insists,
by the neutralisation of all
Germany, the pressure of
Soviet military might on the
virtually disarmed nation’s
borders could well produce the
subversion of the German
State.
“This neither West Germany
nor Nato can permit. The
Germans would thereby lose
their freedom, and the rest of
Western Europe would see a
new Communist powerhouse
Frankfurter “Allgemeine Zeitung.”
OPERATOR KHRUSHCHEV: “WE CAN MAKE A NEW
DOG WITH TWO HEADS—WHY NOT A NEW GERMAN
EAGLE, TOO?”
erected in the heart of the
Continent.
“That is the threat. The
countervailing threat, on the
Soviet side, is the possibility
that unless Germany is unified
there may be an outbreak, in
the Hungarian style, within
East Germany that would
touch-off a major conflagra-
tion.
“Thus the Soviet Union has
an incentive to solve the
German question. From the
Western point of view,
guaranteed free elections
throughout the country would
be the soundest basis for
German unity. But such elec-
tions are a method of attaining
a result, they are not the result
itself. If the West can pro-
duce a formula that would
safeguard German freedom
without supervised elections as
a prerequisite, unity might be
achieved without jeopardising
the interests of either Germany
or her neighbors.”
/Commenting on the un-
official Soviet proposal of
placing the whole of Berlin
under a kind of U.N. trustee-
ship, Peregrine Worsthorne, in
London “Daily Telegraph,”
contends that “the difficulty
with all such isolated solutions,
which do not grapple with the
wider problem of Germany, is
that in settling the future free-
dom of Berlin they would also
settle the future slavery of
Eastern Europe”:
“For if the United Nations
took-over Berlin it would be
a permanent arrangement, in-
volving the legitimisation of the
Pankow regime, with all that
this implies for the future
stability of the Soviet Union’s
Eastern empire.
“On no account, therefore,
should the West agree to with-
draw its troops from Berlin
except as part of a general
German settlement. Interna-
tional guarantees, however
impressive, of the freedom of
a single city are not enough to
set against Western acceptance
of Russia’s post-war gains in
Europe,
“Unless the West loses its
head, therefore, the Soviet
Union will have to move on
from guile and shock-tactics
over Berlin to genuine negoti-
ations on Germany itself
which is the only other rational
way of solving its satellite
problems.”
The greatest danger, the
same writer continues, would
be “for both sides to reach a
German settlement on basically
different assumptions about
each other’s motives.
“Theoretically the West can
afford to take extensive risks,
since it can rely on a pro-
foundly anti-Communist Ger-
man population, which in time
could be expected to bring all
Germany into the Allied camp.
But it would be highly perilous
for the West, relying on this
natural advantage, to enter into
any theoretical agreement
which it never expected to
have to honor in practice. This
might lead to a deadly new
misunderstanding between East
and West.
“At the moment it is
axiomatic with both sides that
neither can afford to lose
Germany. To modify this
axiom under false pretences
would be a certain source of
conflict. Unless, therefore, as
a result of negotiation with
the Soviet Union, the West
decides that Mr. Khrushchev is
now prepared to see a reunified
Germany at some stage and in
some way linked to the West,
it would be better to accept the
present deadlock as the least of
possible evils.
“It is extremely difficult to
see what Moscow would gain
by such a radical change in
policy, unless she is prepared,
under certain conditions, to
renounce her ambitions in
Germany with the idea of con-
solidating the rest of her
Eastern Empire. This is an
infinitely slender possibility,
but in so far as the West has
any scope for new policies
they should be directed towards
tempting and pushing Moscow
in that direction.
“The temptations would
need to be military, and the
pushing diplomatic. Clearly the
West should offer not to make
any military use of Eastern
Germany, and to reduce its
plans for using Western Ger-
many, particularly in the field
of nuclear missiles —in short,
the West should offer some
form of military disengage-
ment.

be tempted to accept German

unification, however gradually
and face-savingly, it will
require military concessions
which go well beyond anything
which S.H.A.P.E. at present
finds it safe to consider.”
Tn a letter to “New York
Times,” Karl Lowenstein,
Professor of Political Science
at Amherst College, puts the
case against the whole notion
that the Berlin impasse “must
be solved within the context of
a general settlement with the
Soviets on Germany or even
on Europe.” He feels that “what
may be attainable at this
time is a limited agreement on
Berlin alone,” which, if success-
ful, “may decontaminate the
atmosphere and open the way
to a rapprochement” :
“American policy should
proceed on the following
assumptions:
“The reunification of Ger-
many on Western and Bonn
terms —free elections in both
parts for the creation of an
all-German democratic Govern-
ment, conclusion of a peace-
treaty with Bonn, and united
Germany’s freedom to remain
in the Western military alliance
—is impossible at this time.
Consent to the establishment
of a dynamic nation of
75,000,000 people equipped
with nuclear weapons would
be suicide for the Soviets. Con-
fronted with a militarised Ger-
many pressing for the rectifica-
tion of her borders mutilated
by defeat would permanently
rally the Poles and the Czechs
behind the Soviets.
“The claim of the Bonn
Government, endorsed by the
West, to represent all of Ger-
many and to derive therefrom
the right to ignore the existence
of the German Democratic
Republic, a going concern as a
State, if not without moral
justification, is utterly un-
realistic.
“In view of these hard
realities the only feasible
policy of the West can be that
of letting the two German
segments work out their own
solutions. For the time being
their socio-economic diver-
gences may render a genuine
confederation impracticable
and call for gradualism. Co-
operative working-agreements
have been in force between
them for years on many tech-
nical matters.
“If, for the time being, a
global settlement of the
German issue is beyond realisa-
tion for breaking the Berlin
impasse, two approaches may
merit attention. In each case
the overriding consideration
must be the preservation of the
freedom of the courageous
West Berliners.
“One would be to expand
the Soviet proposal of estab-
lishing a Free City of Western
Beriin. Such a regime, com-
prising all of Berlin, could be
created under United Nations
auspices and supervision, and
the Allies would withdraw,
Appealing as the proposal may
seem at first, the disastrous
experience of the Free City of
Danzig under the League of
Nations is too discouraging to
recommend a repetition.
“The other contingency con-
sists in the transfer of the
responsibility for Western
Berlin from the Allies to the
Bonn Government, where it
rightfully belongs, and the
replacement of the Allied by
Western German military
forces. This operation of
changing the guard, under-
written by the Four Powers
and the two German Govern-
ments, should be based on iron-
clad guarantees for free com-
munication with the West.
“The obvious dangers in-
herent in this proposal should
not be minimised. They are
counter-balanced, however, by
their advantages in the long-
run. The Soviets may even
be willing to consent, as the
price for the Allied withdrawal
from Berlin, to the inclusion
of Eastern Berlin in the

Government of Greater Berlin.
The Bonn Government may
find it to its advantage to drive
a wedge into the Iron Curtain
and, by establishing workable
contacts with the Eastern
regime on a limited field,
develop Berlin into a testing-
ground for further political co-
operation on a larger scale.
“Obviously this bold pro-
posal calls for the abandonment
of frozen thought-patterns and
sterile legalisms in both Bonn
and the West. On the part of
Dr. Adenauer it will require a
statesmanlike reappraisal of his
orientation. The Berlin situ-
ation is bound to become more
untenable. Time is working for

U.K. Prison Reform
TTome Secretary R. A.
Butler’s White Paper on
“Penal Practice in a Changing
Society” has revealed some
startling facts about crime in
the U.K. “First,” reports
London “Daily Telegraph,”
“after the rise during the war,
which might, after all, have
been expected, there has been
no decrease. On the contrary,
though there have been a series
of fluctuations, each peak has
been higher than the one be-
fore. Secondly, in the most
recent increase, which started
from 1954, the predominant,
though unhappily not the only,
influence has been a sharp rise
in the number of offences com-
mitted by young men of
between 16 and 21”:
“What lies behind these
figures no one knows. Of
course, there are plenty of
guesses. We can only say that
in the light of this century’s
improved education, wider
welfare services and higher
standards of living they are
profoundly disturbing. About
the effect of the increase in
crime there is no doubt. The
ordinary citizen, and especially
his child, is exposed to new
risks of loss or injury. Mean-
while, the courts and the
prisoQs are all but swamped.
the plovers that bloom in the sprang .trala,
have nothing to do with the case .
I’Ve GOT To TAKE UNDER MY WING, TRM.A,
A MOST UNATTRACTIVE OLD THING, TRA'IA ,
WITH A CARICATURE OE A PACE l
VICKY, IN LONDON “NEW STATESMAN.”
Indeed, overcrowding in
prisons has reached such a
pitch that there are now
over 6000 men, out of 15,000,
sleeping three to a cell. The
prison authorities are unable
to treat the majority of
prisoners in ways and by
methods which even now they
know to be not only possible
but proper.”
In a comment fairly typical
of the general U.K. press
reaction to the White Paper’s
proposals for reform, “York-
shire Post” notes that though
“they bear the marks of a
humane mind” this “does not
mean that they are plans for
coddling the wrongdoer”:
“We are certain that there
will be nothing namby-pamby
about the proposed new
methods of dealing with young
offenders. The aim here is
to make a determined attempt
to tackle the teenage crime-
wave which -has added so
alarmingly to the Borstal popu-
lation during the past three
years. Short, sharp, shock-
treatment in detention-centres
is to be givbn to young toughs.
Where it is judged necessary to
impose a stiffer sentence, a
measure of flexibility will be
permitted in deciding upon
the period of detention and
training. Much will depend on
the offenders’ response to treat-
ment. If they seem likely to go
straight they may win release
at any time after six months.
This scheme offers opportu-
nities for experiment in a field
where experiment may produce
valuable results.
‘ “But what matters most at
this stage is the speed with
which the gravely overcrowded
and hopelessly out-of-date jails
of this country can be replaced.
For this reason chief im-
portance attaches tO' Mr.
Butler’s prison-building pro-
gramme. Where prisoners of
all types and widely different
ages are crowded together and
large numbers of men spend
much time in demoralising idle-
ness, the prisons themselves can
become breeding-places of
crime. Reformative training
becomes wellnigh impossible in
the conditions obtaining.
“We would support also the
proposed appointment of a
working-party to decide
whether a scheme for State
compensation for the victims of
crimes of violence is acceptable
in principle and workable in
practice. As Mr. Butler
acknowledges, in the public
mind the interests of the
offender may often seem to
be placed before those of his
victim. It seems to us a sound
principle that those who suffer
physical injury through no
fault of their own from a
vicious attack by a smash-and-
grab raider or some other thug,
should receive compensation in
just the same way as the person
who suffers from industrial
injury.
“Many of those who are
hurt in this way are small shop-
keepers who may be placed
in dire straits as a result of
some attack which makes them
unable to attend to business.
We believe that it would be
salutary if, as has also been
suggested, offenders were made
to contribute restitution money
out of their prison earnings.
This would help to bring home
to them in a small but regular
way that they had not only
broken the law but had
inflicted serious harm on
another person.

crime is committed by the

Lysenko Again
T}rom New York “Herald
Tribune”:
“If history ever settles on a
stock figure to typify the in-
scrutable contradictions of the
Soviet world, it could well be
Trofim Lysenko. The pro-
duction of food has always
been one of the Soviet Union's
gravest problems. It has pro-
vided their history with some
of its most sanguinary episodes.
Yet the Soviet leaders placed
all their faith in a man,
Lysenko, whose agricultural
theory defied, and continues to
defy, all demonstrable truth.
“Lysenko holds that environ-
mentally acquired character-
istics of animals or plants can
be transmitted genetically in
a single generation. No one
else used to believe that except
Stalin, and after his death
Lysenko fell from favor,
“But then Nikita Khrush-
chev, fired by his own boasts
of surpassing food-production
in the United States, re-
embraced the old theory, and
the star of Lysenko once more
rose balefully over the plains
and the meadows. In October
he received his seventh Order
of Lenin. Now he has triumph-
ed over the Soviet Academy of
Sciences itself, obtained the dis-
missal of scientific editors and
forced the academicians to
promise they would follow his
leadership in the field of agri-
culture.
“That is the worst of his
victory—that he will be able
to exercise dictatorial control
over any scientist who dis-
agrees with him. It is a pity
that their adventures in space
have not taught the Soviets the
truth about Lysenko.”
British Nava! Strength
Admiral of the Fleet
Viscount Cunningham of
Hyndhope, in a letter to
London “Sunday Times” com-
menting on that paper’s publi-
cation of extracts from a book
by Admiral Doenitz which
described the German attempts
to strangle British merchant
shipping in World War 11,
notes that “it is remarkable
how sound was Doenitz’s judg-
ment regarding the only way
this country could be brought
to its knees once invasion had
proved impossible”:
“Britain still lives by the
safe arrival of her merchant
shipping; and a future enemy
—should one unhappily arise—
will therefore be certain to
attack us at the same vital point
that Doenitz understood so
well.
“That being so, one would
expect any British Government
to take out a reasonable
insurance-policy against a
repetition of a challenge which,
twice in our lifetime, has been
so narrowly defeated. Yet as
Sir Arthur Bryant has recently
pointed out in your columns,
and as I have at times vainly
argued in the House of Lords,
the present strength of the
Royal Navy and of Coastal
Command of the Royal Air
Force provides no adequate
insurance of that nature.
“I cannot believe that the
British public is so concerned
with its own material security
that it will much longer remain
blind to the implications of
relying excessively on the so-
called ‘deterrent’ which can
never provide security for our
shipping. When, I would ask,
is some really imaginative step
—such as combining our
surface ship and maritime air
resources into one great Royal
Maritime Service —going to be
considered ; and what steps are
being taken to provide the
ships and aircraft so plainly
needed for it?
“I remember only too well
how in 1945 we had to deploy
over 400 escort vessels and
some 800 maritime aircraft to
counter less than two-score Ü-
boats working in our coastal
waters. Today all the Nato
Powers together could not
produce a fraction of that
strength ; and modern sub-
marines will be far more
dangerous than those of 1945.”
Various Voices
President Eisenhower: “We
cannot build peace through
desire alone. Moreover, we
have learnt the bitter lesson
that international agreements,
historically considered by us
as sacred, are regarded in Com-
munist doctrine and in practice
to be mere scraps of paper,
We can have no confidence in
an y treaty to which Corn-
munists are a party except
where such a treaty provides
within itself for self-enforcing
mechanisms ”
Lord Hailsham : “In the last
resort the future of this
country is bound up with the
confidence which it inspires,
We [Great Britain] have not
the power to hold things stable
as we did in the 19th century
by our economic and naval
strength. We can survive by
inspiring confidence and by no
other means. Personally I
know of no other method of
inspiring confidence than by
deserving it. This applies to
our currency no less than to
our political integrity.”


Backfire
By ROGER V. CARR
< 1 7 rOU know the big
rabbit-warren down
JL by the gums?” Uncle
Jack asked at
breakfast.
“Yeah,” said John wearily.
“We’re going to dig it out
today.”
“Gee whiz,” said John, “you
do take our pleasures hard.”
“Good on ya,” said Tom,
always hopeful that Uncle
Jack’s ideas might turn out
fun instead of hard work.
“We’ll want a crowbar, axe,
and shovel,” said Uncle Jack,
planning his campaign on the
table.
“I’ll go and get them,” said
Tom, grabbing his toast in his
hand and running out.
“Couple of chaff-bags to put
them in,” called Uncle Jack
after him.
“Never get any,” said John.
“Couple of times we’ve put
ferrets in there and got nothing
out.”
“Didn’t do it properly,” said
Uncle Jack. “I was watching
them burrers this morning and
saw dozens.”
“0.k.,” said John “When
are we going?”
“Now. Rabbits for tea,” he
told Mum.
We climbed up from the
table and walked outside,
following Tom’s track through
the dew-wet grass across to the
shed.
“Got the lot,” he said,
coming out.
We walked on down the
paddock. A magpie was
carolling cheekily at the sun
from the top of a tree, the
sound of a tractor drifting
lightly from across the valley.
“Makes you feel good to be
alive,” said Uncle Jack, expan-
ding his chest. “I’d like to be
living down on the farm here
with you boys.”
“Aren’t you?” asked John.
Uncle Jack looked at him
doubtfully, not sure how to
take it. Then he swelled out
his chest again, deciding the
morning was too good to be
spoilt.
“The country’s the place all
right,” he said.
“You ought to try throwing
a shovel round on a rabbit-
warren,” said John.
“I’m feeling that well I
might,” said Uncle Jack. “By
gosh, I might.”
ITE stamped on happily down
to the warren. It was a
pretty big one, a hundred
burrows we’d netted for the
ferrets. It stretched right
through a square about 15ft.
by 15ft.
The soil was fairly sandy,
almost bare of grass from the
feet of the rabbits. Their runs
went off at various angles, into
the paddock one side, and the
scrub the other.
Walk down at dusk and a
hundred yards away you’d hear
the thump of the big bucks
warning the rest of danger.
Tom threw the bags and the
rest of the stuff on the ground,
standing back while Uncle
Jack looked the warren over.
“Start from this end,” said
Uncle Jack. “You boys get to
work blocking the holes.”
John took a look at Uncle
Jack and then grabbed the
shovel and started on the holes.
Tom and I grabbed the axe
and the crowbar and gave a
hand.
Tom sliced the holes in from
above with the axe while I
jabbed at them with the crow-
bar. Uncle Jack sat down on
an old dead tree-trunk and
rolled a smoke.
It didn’t iake us long to fill
them. Uncle Jack waved his
cigarette in the general direc-
tion of the holes nearest him.
“Start digging them,” he
said. “Shove the crowbar in
first, then use the axe to chop
along the top. If three of you
grab the bar then, and lift,
you’ll open the burra.”
“What about the shovel?”
asked John.
“You can use that to clear
out the dirt when the bar is
out.”
“Gee, thanks,” said John.
We shoved the bar into the
first hole and Tom ran the axe
along the top. Then with the
three of us on the end we lifted
the bar till it cut through the
dirt, leaving a few feet of the
burrow open.
John grabbed the shovel and
cleared out the dirt to have
another go.
“Pity you only thought of
three tools,” said John to
Uncle Jack. “Crook to see
that wonderful vitality of
yours going to waste.”
“What?” asked Uncle Jack,
jumping up. “Haven’t I got
to rest so that when a rabbit
gets away from you I can
chase it?”
“0.k., 0.k.,” said John. “I
only asked a simple question.”
Uncle Jack went back to the
log, shaking his head sadly.
We worked further in on
different burrows but couldn’t
find a bunny. The warren was
starting to look like an A-bomb
disaster and we were sweating.
It’s no plaything, digging-up a
warren.
“Not getting far, are we?”
asked Uncle Jack. “I’ve been
thinking of easier ways of
doing the job.”
“There ain’t a rabbit in the
whole heap,” said John.
“Dunno where they all get to.”
“Must be in there,” said
Uncle Jack, “and I know just
the way to shift them. Go and
get me a gallon or so of petrol
and some old tins.”
shot-off up the paddock,
glad to get away from the
shovel. John and I sat down
beside Uncle Jack and waited.
A few minutes later Tom
came walking back.
“Grab a couple of tins each,”
said Uncle Jack, taking the
petrol.
We walked over to the
warren and opened a burrow
each as Uncle Jack told us.
“Now hold out a tin each,”
he said, taking the lid off the
can.
He tipped an inch or so in
the bottom of each tin.
“Now shove them down a
burrer and fill the dirt back in,”
he said.
We pushed them down and
filled the burrows in again. We
kept on doing this till all the
tins were used up and then
went back to the log.
“Now we?ve got to make a
fuse,” said Uncle Jack, pulling
his handkerchief out of his
pocket.
We watched while he rolled
it tightly into a rope. Then
he dropped it on the log beside
him and rolled another smoke.
“Got to give the juice time
to evaporate and fill the whole
warren,” said Uncle Jack.
“Having any luck?” called
Dad.
He was up by the black-
berry clump with the adze.
“Haven’t sighted a rabbit,”
called Tom. “But Uncle Jack’s
got an idea to clean them all
out.”
“Come and watch,” called
Uncle Jack. “Have a look at
science at work.”
“Not flaming likely,” called
Dad. “When you start playing
with science it gets pretty
lethal.”
“Garn,” snarled Uncle Jack.
He carefully stubbed out his
cigarette and stood up.
“Time to have a go,” he said,
walking over to the warren
with the can and his fuse.
He knelt down beside one
of the burrows we hadn’t
wrecked, and unplugged it.
Then he pushed his fuse half-
way-down and filled the dirt
back in, packing it down
tightly. With the shovel he
built a small dam round the
fuse.
"Give us the can,” he told
John.
John handed it to him and
we watched while he poured
petrol over the end of his
handkerchief fuse.
“Now you kids get back to
the log with the can of juice,”
he told us.
We walked back to the log.
Dad was leaning on the adze
watching us interestedly.
Crouching down behind the
log we watched Uncle Jack get
out his matches.
“Ready?” he called.
“Right-oh,” called John.'
T Tncle Jack struck a match,
held the flame to the fuse,
then turned and sprinted for
the log.
We watched over the top of
the log, ready to duck when
anything happened.
“Is it a dud?” asked John
after a while.
“Got to give the flame time
to work down the fuse,” said
Uncle Jack. “Then she’ll go
up.”
“You’re a long time,” called
Dad. “You trying to starve
’em out?”
Suddenly the ground under
us trembled, the rabbit-warren
staying peaceful. Then from
behind came a thundering roar.
“You silly lotta coots!”
yelled Dad.
We looked round to see
him dancing round the pad-
dock, clothes, face and hands
blackened. The blackberry-
bush was in flames, dead
rabbits spread all around.
“Should have worked that
out,” said Uncle Jack thought-
fully. “Might have known the
rabbits would have an escape-
hole.”

fastening-cord, like our paddles
and other gear, and I think it
went overboard when the valu
hit the canoe. It was good, too,
that the wind and the sea were
still quiet, because I was very,
very tired, but Finau was still
strong and happy.
“Tione had come down to the
** point to look out for us,
and when he saw what we
were bringing he ran quick to
tell the village; and all the
people—men, women and
children—were there, running
out into the water to meet us,
shouting and splashing and
falling over each other and
getting in the way so we could
not use our paddles.
“Everybody tried to get hold
of the canoe or the outrigger
to pull us in, but there was
still deep water for the bobao
when the fish went aground
and an outrigger-pole broke.
“Then men loosened the
lashings and dragged the fish
ashore by the tail. I was very
tired and my back and arms
were very stiff and sore, and
when the bobao went aground
and I stood up to step out into
the shallow water my legs
‘broke,’ the bobao spun round
and round, the day turned to
night, and I heard the sea

roaring and Finau calling far
away, ‘Lolo! Lolo! ’ but I
could not stop from going to
sleep.
“I did not see the big fish
again, only the tail and the
big bones and a piece that the
doctor kept for me. I do not
know how long I slept, or how
often I wakened-up long
enough to say, ‘lnu vail’
[drink water], but when I
wakened-up truly the doctor
was there, laughing with my
father and mother.
“He had a mouth-organ for
me for birthday-present, and
he told me the fish was not all
gone. He still had a piece for
me. The steamer had been in,
and he had got a lot of ice,
and he was keeping part of
what Finau had given to him
till I would be well enough
to eat it.
“After I told him, ‘Malo
si ofa [thanks for your kind-
ness], Toketa,’ I asked my
father, ‘Have you washed and
dried the line and oiled the
hook?’ —because I always did
that as soon as we came home,
and the doctor laughed out
loud and said, ‘Malie [Bravo!],
Lolo —now I know you are a
real fisherman,’ and I was very
happy.”
“And did they weigh and
measure the fish, Lolo?”
“Not weigh ; it was too big
for the machine, but it was
long the same as the bobao —
one fathom and one half-
fathom —that is three-yard,
eh? Finau told me six men
carried it with three poles, ika
laid aubito, aubito [a very, very
big fish], like no old-blind-one
can remember, and it was
making very strong mana for
Finau and his hook and line.”
HThe sun had set and the twi-
light was rapidly fading
before Lolo had finished his
story, so I lit the veranda lamp,
a 300-candlepower pressure-
lantern, with a reflector hood.
Lolo was keenly interested
in it, especially in its little
white “gas-net” that shone like
the sun.
“lane he said, “very good
strong lamp! I think it will
be very good for ama [fish-
spearing by torch-light]. Is all
right for you to bring, one
dark, quiet night, when tide is
good, and we go to ama at
Neiafu-tahi?”
As that shallow sandy bay
was only a quarter of a mile
away, that would suit me very
well, so we arranged that Lolo
should call for me when con-
ditions were right.
“Sai-be, Lolo, alua e?”
[“AH right, you will go, eh?”]
“10, malo tagata-eiki, nofoa
e?” [“Yes, thank you, sir, you
will stay, eh?”]
And after this convention-
ally polite leave-giving and
leave-taking Lolo departed, to
come again another day when
we would spear “too many
fiss.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Unemployment Insurance
When the last recession hit
the big U.S. auto.-towns small
tradespeople whose customers
were mostly auto.-workers
braced themselves for lean
times. But in most cases those
times didn’t come or were
cushioned and delayed. At the
end of six months of high
unemployment-figures traders
who had faced bankruptcy
were still solvent. They found
that the unemployed auto.-
workers hadn’t stopped spend-
ing—thanks to Supplementary
Unemployed Benefit.
This experience has led
many U.S. unions to fight for
inclusion and extension of
S.U.B. in their agreements.
S.U.B. benefits are supple-
mentary to Federal and State
unemployment-insurance pay-
ments ; they are financed by
industry and arose from
union-and-management nego-
tiations in some big U.S.
industries three years ago ; and
they provide the laid-off
worker with up to 65 per cent,
of his “take-home” pay for up
to 39 weeks, depending on the
agreement and the amount paid
by the State. Result is a man
doesn’t stop spending as soon
as he’s out of work, so a reces-
sion in one industry doesn't
develop into a calamity for a
whole State.
Something of the sort could
operate in Australia, with both
employers and employees con-
tributing in the same way as
for superannuation. In fact,
it should be an attractive pro-
position for some insurance
company. Pieter Nuyts
(W.A.).
Rabbit Control
With Vict o r i a’s rabbit-
destruction programme im-
pending, a tour of the western
areas of the State reveals a
weakness in the approach to
this grazing and soil-conserva-
tion problem—absentee land-
lordism on some of the larger
properties nullifies the eradica-
tion efforts of neighboring
independent landholders.
Management of holdings
owned by estates or companies
is sometimes entrusted to
a caretaker who has far too
much to do to worry a great
deal about rabbits. Also, some
of these properties are closed
to the weekend rabbiter and
to the professionals engaged by
the fur and meat trades. These
trades claim to account for 90
per cent, of rabbits killed in
Victoria (with myxo. and
other causes making-up the
remainder), but they can’t be
expected to fulfil this claim if
denied access to properties
where rabbits run. freely.
Crown lands have long been
blamed for maintaining rabbit
numbers ; but these areas are
systematically dealt with—
even if not as often as they
should be.
I know many landholders
who, prior to myxo., could
boast that they hadn’t a rabbit
“Can I have the rocket tonight , Pop ?”
on their property. But this
had been achieved only by
much expensive netting, regu-
lar poisoning, digging-out, and
hunting with gun and dog.
How long can this immunity
be preserved while some of
the bigger properties remain
breeding-grounds for the pest?
Plain Australian (Vic.).
Mary Tudor
Although he may have had
access to Spanish State papers
not calendared till 1954, Hugh
Ross Williamson, in his sym-
pathetic portrait of Mary
Tudor, The Sisters (Red Page
21/1/ ’59), hasn’t really broken
new ground: other modern his-
torians have taken much the
same line.
The “Bloody Mary” of
Protestant legend had some
attractive qualities. Chris-
topher Morris’s The Tudors,
which contains a very favor-
able portrait of Elizabeth I,
claims that in character Mary
was the best of her family.
Except in the matter of religion,
she was naturally humane —she
was even willing to pardon
rebels. And WilL Durant, in
his remarkably impartial The
Reformation, points out that
Mary was actually the first
European ruler to proclaim
religious freedom.
This generous gesture was
received ungraciously by those
who favored the new religious
doctrines. They redoubled
their intrigues against her and
eventually exasperated her into
starting large-scale persecution.
However, most of those burnt
for heresy in her reign were
not harmless people who
merely wanted to worship God
in their own way and were pre-
pared to concede the same
right to others. Professor Pol-
lard has remarked that Mary
saved Elizabeth the trouble of
executing a good many dan-
gerous subversives. In those
days religion had so firm a hold
on the popular mind that doc-
trines akin to Communism and
anarchism tended to take
religious guise.
Others wha suffered in her
reign, though not social sub-
versives, were hostile to her
because of her religion. The
mistake which won for Mary
an undeserved sobriquet from
posterity was in choosing
heresy, not treason, as the sub-
ject of prosecution. Her
father-in-law, the Emperor
Charles V, favored prosecu-
tion for treason, but the Eng-
lish Privy Council advised
heresy, and she followed them.
Her marriage to Philip of
Spain was unfortunate. Spain
was the most powerful State
in Europe. England feared that
it might lose its national iden-
tity, and the English mercan-
tile classes were already
beginning to be jealous of
Spain’s grip on the New World.

Another Gold Coast?
Why should anyone of sound
Australian upbringing want
another Gold Coast (B.
18/2/’59)? Wouldn’t it be
much better if all intending
Gold-coasters were diverted to
a rehabilitation-centre, in the
north of Australia, and there
exposed to the real Australian
landscape for a while? Then,
having undergone a thorough
course of de-Yankification,
they could be put through a test
for re-naturalisation. Failures

Color in N.Z.
Dr. H. R. Bennett, who was
refused a drink in the Papa-
kura Hotel (N.Z.) because he
was a Maori, is a son of the
late Bishop Bennett and a
brother of C. M. Bennett, a
Maori of culture and distinc-
tion recently appointed N.Z.
Ambassador in Malaya. No
wonder there was 'a rumpus!
There is really no color-bar
in N.Z.—except maybe in
isolated places —though it is
admitted that the Pukekohe-
Papakura territory might have
a touch of Little Rock in its
veins. That class-distinction
exists is evident from the fact
that it was the upper-register
strain in the Bennett history
that caused the furore; it
would have passed unnoticed
if some unknown Hori or
Henare had breasted the Papa-
kura bar and had been told to
“get.”
If Hori puts his mouth to
the beer-hose in the public bar
and stays there until closing-
time not a word is said—as
long as he pays. He always
does. Under the Welfare State
the average Maori makes
money too easily, has drifted
to the cities in thousands, and
in many ways is becoming a
nuisance, Maori girls included.
If this goes on unchecked by
the Maori Welfare people,

there may be a color-bar —but
the Maori will not be to blame.
The equally well-paid pakeha
worker gives him a poor
example. He is often vicious
in his cups ; Hori is just boy-
ishly and foolishly happy, but
very noisy. The Welfare way
has not written-down the better-
class Maori. There is more
dignity, culture and charm
about him than the average
better-class pakeha.
Saving inevitable and occa-
sional class-distinctions there
will be no color problem in
N.Z. if the average Maori is
given a lead in good behavior
by his pakeha brother. Pat
Lawlor (N.Z.).
Political Apathy
“P.0.M.C.” is mistaken in
thinking that it is only
in countries with a number of
Parliaments, like Australia and
the U.S.A., that politics is
regarded “as a pretty dirty
business, and policies are boldly
controlled by pressure-groups”
(B. 28/1 / ’59).
France, for instance, has a
highly-centralised governmental
system. During both the Third
Republic and the short-lived
Fourth Republic there were a
number of political scandals,
some of them world-famous.
A leading French politician of
the 1930'5, M. Tardieu,- esti-
mated that about 200 French
Deputies were in the pay of the
automobile industry, and that
other pressure-groups retained
many members to push their
interests. (Examples can be
read in Herbert Luthy’s The
State of France.) Similar cor-
ruption was practised in some
other European States.
On the other hand, the Euro-
pean State with the longest and
best record of democratic
government Switzerland
is a federal State. The strongest
European Power from the
1870's to 1918 the German
Empire—was also federal in
form. So is the progressive
Bonn Republic (West Ger-
many).—Farinmail (N.S.W.).
If it is true, as “P.0.M.C.”
says (B. 28/l/’59), that the
politician is more highly
regarded in England than in
Australia and the U.S., it is
scarcely due solely to Eng-
land’s unitary form of govern-
ment.
Part, at least, of the reason
is that until recently politics
in England was the preserve of
a class which did not need
to make any direct financial
profit out of a seat in Parlia-
ment. The same class filled the
upper levels of the civil and
diplomatic services, armed
forces, etc. But this did not
lead to charges of nepotism ; it
was regarded by all as part of
the natural order. They also
set great store by good manners
and the sanctity of the pledged
word, and punished severely
any open breach of their
(admittedly artificial) moral
code.
In any case, though the
present system has worked
well for the English, it has
been harder on the minorities.
The Scottish Highlands have
lost most of their population
since union; and the Clyde
valley (where most of the
Scots now live) and South
Wales were about the worst-
hit parts of the country in the
depression. The case of Ire-
land is even worse. Union was
forced on the Irish, and they
always resisted it —resistance
led to the successful rebellion
of 40 years ago. Now Eire is
not only out of the Union but,
in a typically Irish way, out
of the Commonwealth while
still a member of it; and the
North was only kept in by
being granted a Parliament
of sorts, thus resulting in a
half-united, half-federal system.
If Australia abolished the
States the coastal strip from
Newcastle to Melbourne and
as far inland as Lithgow, Can-
berra and the Snowy which
now holds most of our popu-
lation and gets most of the
Governmental capital-expendi-
ture —would absolutely control
the country. In this connec-
tion “Tock Emma’s” article


(B. 28/l/’59) is apposite. He
sees an invader from the north
having to cross many hundreds
of miles of “almost empty”
country before reaching the
south-east corner, which most
southerners seem to regard as
Australia. But what if the
invader landed a strong force
in the N.T. or North Queens-
land, started pouring colonists
in behind it, and threatened
instant nuclear reprisal against
Canberra if any action were
taken against him? A
sovereign national Government
might be tempted to come to
terms with him for its own
safety, regarding the “empty”
North as a small price to pay
for peace. After all, his
advanced air-bases would be
very close to Canberra.
Most of the trouble with our
present system is that we have
not made a success, so far, of
adapting the English theory of
checks and balances to our
needs. England’s system has
a class basis; as we had no
clear-cut class-distinctions the
framers of our Constitution
based ours on State rights. It
failed, because the Senate soon
became party-dominated, and
uniform taxation, by destroy-
ing the autonomy of the
States, completed the wreck.
The first requirement is
more and smaller States, which
would have a chance of
developing a real community
of interest. To break the poli-
tical ties, Senators might be
nominated by State Govern-
ments, either for life or till a
fixed retiring - age. Eligible
would be ex-Cabinet Ministers,
State and Federal, and possibly
also judges, ex-service chiefs
and other leading citizens. A
condition would be that they
must, before nomination, have
severed all party political ties,
and not renew them.
For the other problem, either
uniform tax will have to go or
the States must find other
sources of income sufficient
for their needs that would be
entirely under their own con-
trol. — Magnoon (Q.).
Overseas Investment
Admittedly overseas invest-
ment in Australia should be
modified to curb duplication of
industries and prevent too
much money from going out of
the country in dividends (B.
21/1/ ’59), but Australia can’t
be developed quickly without
help from overseas capital.
Local savings aren't sufficient.
If overseas investors create
genuine new industries, and
provision is for Aus-
tralian capital to acquire shares
when available, the process will
be entirely beneficial to Aus-
tralia.
Fred- Aarons is wrong in
calling it “exploitation of our
labor and resources.” Indus-
tries founded on overseas
capital have to pay award-
wages and provide the same
working-conditions as local
firms ; and the overseas share-
holder has as much right as the
Australian one to a fair return
on his capital. It is only if the
amount of money going out
in the form of dividends
threatens seriously to diminish
Australia’s foreign - currency
reserves that there is any need
"It's only excess luggage .”
for Government interference.
Cunedda (N.S.W.).
Sources of Power
It is no doubt unwise for Aus-
tralia, lacking oil of its own,
to become any more dependent
than necessary on imported
liquid fuels ; but, of the three
Australian sources of power
which “R.H.” names (B.
28/1/’59), coal is surely by far
the most important. Uranium,
of course, can be, and at places
like Calder Hall actually is,
used for generating power ;
but so far it can’t compete
commercially with coai.
As for solar heat, the capital-
cost of harnessing it in worth-
while quantities and the need
for an alternative source of
power ready to be turned-on
as soon as clouds or darkness
obscure the sun make it hardly
worth considering. It might be
different if it were possible to
•store large quantities of elec-
tricity in batteries.
So, until such time as we
have our own oil, it would
seem wisest to go on generat-
ing our electric-power with
steam raised by our own coal.
And, though we must have
some diesel-locomotives, let us
continue with our steam-locos
for all ordinary freight.—-

So, forbidden to drive along
the highways at even 30 miles
an hour, he used to flip by air
from Bringelly to Bankstown
aerodrome, where his com-
pany operated, at a higher
speed than he could ever have
achieved on the road.
tjrofessor Griffith Taylor,
•*- in his remarkable, recently-
published book, Sydneyside
Scenery, explains that the
Wianamatta shales were de-
posited about 160-million years
ago. South Creek, known to
the aborigines as Wianamatta,
is regarded as representing the
centre of what is described
geologically as the Sydney
Basin. The Wianamatta shales
are so called because, under
South Creek, these shales are
several hundred feet thick. The
Hawkesbury sandstone is be-
neath them.
One- or two-million years
ago the Hawkesbury sandstone
around Sydney and the Blue
Mountains was thrust up by
crustal folding, but the South
Creek area resisted this up-
thrust, and Griffith Taylor
consequently calls it the
Wianamatta Stillstand.
Where “crustal dimpling”
has occurred, the pushed-up
areas have in many cases been
eroded down to the bare sand-
stone. But under South Creek
the Hawkesbury sandstone
remains more-or-less in its
original position, overlain by
its shale and, of course, its
surface clay and soil, probably
for a hundred-million years or
more.
The sandstone ridges north
and south of Sydney and
around Katoomba, with their
waratahs, banksias, boronias,
etc., have been, as explained,
a much more recent develop-
ment.
It appears to be soil, and
soil alone, that is responsible
for the striking contrast be-
tween the flora of the coast
and that of South Creek —a
difference between plants
liking light, hungry, sandy
soils and those preferring the
ancient, heavy, acid clays and
shales.
Where sand-dunes occur
within the shale areas, as near
Richmond, the banksia and
“coastal” scribbly-gum re-
appear.
In “A View From Fernhill”
I ventured the conclusion that
around Bringelly, and along
South Creek, time had stood
still (historically) for a century
or more. Reading Griffith
Taylor, one will agree that,
geologically, it has stood still
in his “Wianamatta Stillstand”
for most of 160-million years.
Hence the smooth, rolling hills
and tall timbers of the mature
landscape.
New Recordings
An Olympic Concert
H.M.V. have recorded
(ODLP 7526) the concert (at
the Melbourne new Olympic
swimming-pool) in which Sir
Bernard Heinze conducted the
combined Sydney and Vic-
torian Symphony Orchestras
as part of the Olympic Arts
Festival in 1956.
Title of the disk is Olympic
Concert, and on the first side
is Clive Douglas’s “Olympic
Overture.” This opens with a
Prokofiev -like flare of
trumpets; and the brass
reference is maintained right
through to a sprightly four-
four movement (does this
depict the torch - bearing
athlete?). Soon the trumpet
motif reappears, and then
there’s a muscular march-
section, somewhat reminiscent
of Elgar; another burst of
trumpeting, and the piece con-
cludes, in the tastiest tradi-
tional way, with a long unison
note.
A pithy work, and, if not
developed as much as it might
have been, says in its context
what it wants to say eco-
nomically and colorfully.
On the reverse side Borodin’s
“Polovtsian Dances” from
“Prince Igor” are done so well
you forget that the orchestra
numbers 160 players. Tin Pan
Alley must be thanked for
reminding one that “Stranger
in Paradise” is borrowed from
Borodin ; but there is no
shortage of freshness in the
playing.

Sweet ancT Cool
In Stolen Hours (Capitol T
884) Gordon Jenkins steals
upon the ear with an orchestra
sporting no fewer than nine
French-horns.
On paper, that looks rather
as if his brass scoring would
tend to become muddy. But
no ; in the measured beat of
the first number, “Sophisti-
cated Lady,” they merely add
a touch of brown-sugar to the
saccharine.
Nor could the horns be
accused of slipping their
leashes in the Mexican-
flavored concoction called “In
the Heat of the Day.” In fact,
the horns are pleasant, and are
skilfully used in the rollick-
ing tune “Valencia” first,
horns play against tympani,
then the strings fight with side-
drums, then everything and
everybody play at once. And
Jenkins himself is authoritative
in a popular manner in “If
I Could be with You,” where
the piano darkens the string
texture with meditative tenor
notes.
First number on Side Two,
“I Live Alone,” is spoilt by
thickness from the reed sec-
tion ; but “Moonlight in the
Ganges” is interpreted, rightly,
as a faintly hollow, moon-
beam-splashed bit of pro-
gramme-music. By way of
contrast, “The Thrill is Gone”
is a vigorous, dru m m y
miniature, and there are two
more tunes —“Bruce’s Blues,”
with a slow duple beat, clarinet
and trombone swoopings; and
the piano-syncopated “When
your Lover has Gone,” in
which the horns spring up like
golden poppies before the
final offering, “Good-bye,”
painted in serene string and
reed colors.

Fred Hartley
Judging by Reflections on
your Piano (Decca LKA 4179),
Fred Hartley, the “Life is
Nothing Without Music” man,
might be described as the old
master of rubato.
He plays a varied collection
—from Brahms and Beethoven
to “Knees up, Mother Brown”
—but this is essentially a light
disk, and the minute he for-
sakes rhythm and attempts on
his own something mildly
classical you feel that this isn’t
the real Hartley. His style is
swinging, carefree and dance-’
bandish, so there is really little
need for him to throw-in
snatches of the classics, as if to
underscore his versatility.
Besides, his touch is rather
heavy, and, while he makes
something of “El Choclo”
(Villoldo, arr. Hartley) and
“There is a Tavern in the
Town,” his version of Beet-
hoven’s “Fur Elise” is a bit
swingy—in the opening bars
there seems to be a slight lag
in the left-hand broken chords,
and the middle section runs
like an express-train.
But the bulk of Hartley’s
music is in lighter vein, and
this is the type of music he
revels in. Take “The Poor
People of Paris”: all sparkle
and crispness. Hartley has
included a number of his own
arrangements, mainly tradi-
tional stuff and Strauss waltzes.
The piece called “Tschai-
kowsky’s Piano Concerto, No.
1 in B Flat Minor” turns out
to be merely the theme—but
Hartley’s arrangement and
playing of it bring out the
tenor theme quite sonorously.
In all, 28 numbers ; and it
can be recommended as a
teenage-party disk. On reflec-
tion, though, it might have
enough nostalgic value to
interest teenagers of the 1920’5.

TESTING THE MILKING-MACHINE
By W. G. WHITTLESTONE
Tn earlier articles I have
•*- shown the importance of
the milking-machine in main-
taining maximum production
from the herd. The machine
must be kept in good order
all the time ; it must never
it is expected that
tranquillising or “hap-
piness” pills, so popu-
lar in America, for
humans, will soon be
available for sheep.
Lambs given tranquil-
lising drugs, it is
claimed, achieve
maturity 28 per cent,
faster than when no
such drug is included
in their diet. Be that
as it may, however,
there is no doubt that

tailed by Elastrator

many dangers of
shock, setback and
disease which assail
lambs that are marked
and tailed by a knife.
break-down during milking.
One of the worst accidents in
the shed is a breakdown which
causes the cows to become
nervous and upset. One such
“But Fm GOING that Way!"
accident can upset some cows
for days.
It is also very important that
the machine operates correctly,
so no damage can be caused to
the cow’s teats. Certain faults
are often associated with an
outbreak of mastitis. This can
be very costly to the farmer.
Even when the cows recover
from an attack it is rare for
the quarters affected to come
back into full production for
the rest of the season. And a
bad outbreak can set a cow
back for life.
What can the farmer do
about testing his machine?
Many years ago I became
interested in how the machine
could influence the health of
the cow’s udder. To find out
just what was going on in the
teat-cups of the machine we
made a recorder from an old
steam-engine indicator. Later
we made another version of the
original recorder and carried
out several field-surveys.
The original recorder was
rather large, but Mr. Phillips,
of the Ruakura (N.Z.) Research
Station, has designed a com-
mercial model which is now on
the market in Australia.
These vacuum-recorders may
be used to test bail-pulsators to
ensure that the ratio is correct
and the squeeze not too snappy.
They may be used to check the
performance of the releaser-
pulsator to ensure that the
releaser is working correctly.
The releaser is such a common
source of trouble that this
particular test is essential for
the smooth ' running of a
machine.
A vacuum - recorder is
often helpful in checking faults
due to wrong layout of the
machine. It is surprising how
often, when one runs over a
plant, the vacuum - recorder
shows readings which explain
why occasionally the releaser
floods or the cups fall off.
Measuring the vacuum at the
cups throws a lot of light on
how the machine is actually
affecting the cows. Certain
types of vacuum-change at the
cups are liable to increase the
way in which mastitis bugs can
get into the udders. When
there has been an increase in
udder-troubles in a herd, it is
important to check-up on the
vacuum at the cups.
I explained the elements of
milking-machine mechanics in
an earlier article. The machine
depends for its efficiency on a
good vacuum-pump maintain-
ing a steady flow of air, the
pressure of which is regulated
by a sensitive vacuum-regulator.
The pump, if it is good, will go
on pumping a steady flow for
years—if looked after properly.
But sometimes the pump loses
capacity—perhaps the farmer
has been careless about oiling
it or has let some detergent
into it. It is very important
to be able to test a vacuum-
pump.
Mechanical pulsators often
wear and develop leaks. Many
farmers are careless about care
of the pulsators, so most
pulsators develop leaks. Some
farmers are too mean to replace
the rubber sealing-rings in the
vacuum-tank and releaser, or


start the dau right!
«*!
•c-wa*
are too lazy to change the
pipe joint-rings regularly.
Perished rubbers cause leaks.
Badly fitting inflations or
cracked claw-tubes are another
source of leakage. All these
things make it necessary to
have some means of measuring
airflow.
A long time ago I tried my
hand at making a simple flow-
meter. It consisted of an
accurate vacuum-gauge and a
specially shaped d> n - hole.
Using this primitive gadget, I
was surprised to discover how
many machines are badly
adjusted ; also I found that
there is a relationship between
the amount of air passing
through the vacuum-regulator
and the rate of milking. This
air we now call “reserve-air” ;
it is a measure of the amount
of air in reserve for such
situations as removing and
changing cups.
My original meter was too
rough. Mr. Phillips again
developed a very good com-
mercial airflow-meter, admir-
ably suited for testing milking-
machines. This, too, is avail-
able commercially in Aus-
tralia, and is in use in many
parts of the country.
The airflow-meter is even
more useful in diagnosing
faults on a machine. It would
take too long to go through the
details of a check-up, but I can
give some idea of how a test is
done, and how faults can be
deduced.
Take the simple example of
a machine which sometimes
lets milk over into the vacuum-
tank and tends to let the cups
fall when a fast milker or two
happen to be in the shed. Also
there is one bail where the
cows seem to be unhappy. They
tend to kick the cups off when
they go into that bail. The
farmer has become fed-up, and
has called in a serviceman
equipped with Ruakura testing-
gear. Let’s follow the test
through, and see what turns-
up.
First, the vacuum-regulator
is disconnected, the plant is
started, and the amount of air
which would normally be going
through the regulator (the
reserve-air) is measured. When
compared with the standard
value for this particular
machine, it is found to be less
than it should be.
The meter is then plugged
straight into the vacuum-tank,
with the rest of the machine
disconnected. The pump-
capacity is correct for the size
and speed at which it is run-
ning, and also for the size of
machine.
Next, the plant is run with
the pulsators shut-off. The
reserve is now quite high, and
a subtraction from the first
reserve-figure shows that the
pulsators are using-up far too
much air. A check on the
airline with the pulsators dis-
connected from it shows no
leaks. It looks as if the trouble
may be in the pulsators.
The releaser-pulsator is now
shut-off, leaving the others
going. Again, by difference,
we find that the releaser-pul-
sator is using the amount of
air it should for this machine.
The faults are apparently in
the bails.
At this stage, the serviceman
uses his vacuum - recorder.
Going over the vacuums at the
pulsator-connections of the
cups one by one, some interest-
ing facts emerge.
Three of the bails have ratios
of between 50-50 and 40-60,
and one of them shows a
funny-shaped curve. Inspec-
tion of the claw-assembly
shows that one of the claw-
tubes has quite a large hole in
it, which is gulping in a lot of
air. The fourth pulsator has a
ratio of about 70-30, and also
has a funny shape. The valve
is hopelessly out of adjustment,
and there is a big leak due to
the soldering having come away
from the nipples on two of the
cup-cases.
Replacing the dud claw-
tube, and blocking the leaks in
the cups temporarily with
“cocky’s solder” (yellow soap),
another measurement is made
of pulsator air-consumption,
and it is found to be normal.
The bail-ratios are now all set
to 30-70, and the releaser
ratio is checked. This is found
to be about 30-70. It should
be 50-50. It is also a bit
sluggish. The valve is set
correctly, and the muck
cleaned-out of the valve-con-
nection to the spit-chamber.
The recorder now reports that
the vacuum-graph is snappy
and the ratio right.
The vacuum - gauge is
checked, and is found to be
reading low by about 2in. of
mercury. The regulator is also
tested. This can be quickly
done with the airflow-meter.
The performance is poor. How-
ever, a thorough clean-up and
the removal of much dust and
dirt bring it back to normal.
After all this, the machine is
checked for water-handling
capacity, and the releaser is
now found to have quite
enough capacity.
Finally, the cows come in.
There’s no trouble in the bail
with the wonky pulsator. The
cows are now quite comfort-
able, and the cups aren’t kicked
off once. They seem to be
staying on better in the other
bails, too. Milking is finished
15min. before normal, and
there’s not a trace of milk in
the vacuum-tank.
The testing job took just on
an hour. The adjustments,
costing only a pound or two,
save about 200 hr. of time in
the shed in one season ; there
is less trouble with falling
cups ; the cows are more con-
tented —and so is the farmer,
because his production over the
next six months will go up
quite a lot. Cows that in the
past were irregular in their
day-to-day production become
much more uniform and give
an improved yield.
The example I have quoted
is typical. There are hundreds
like it. .Multiplied by the
number of farms in the
country it means a lot in terms
of production-costs. Such ser-
vicing and testing make it
possible for all the machines
on our dairyfarms to be effi-
cient all the time, so it’s well
worth the small effort.
Spraying Brigaiow
“Myall”: The Queensland
Agricultural Department plans
to continue the long-range
work on brigalow-control
which it started in 1951. This
year’s trials aim at studying the
value of pulling, ploughing,
burning and spraying the briga-
low during the autumn, winter
and spring, and comparing the
kill from aerial spraying with
that from mechanical means
of control.
As “Bottlejaw” says (B.
21/1/ *59), hormone-spraying
hasn’t been such a success as
was first hoped. Whereas most
of the virgin scrub was killed,
the results of spraying suckers
were generally poor—and this
is one of the most pressing
problems in brigalow-control.
Aerial spraying is quick, but
the weather must be perfectly
calm, and the aircraft must fly
very low, skimming the tops
of the trees. Wind-drift is the
big problem, and no doubt this
has been the cause of many
failures. No matter how calm
the day, slight air-currents will
carry the spray away from the
target area. Light helicopters
might be the 'answer, as they
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(19/2,/’59)
Queensland should receive heavy rains with consequent
flooding during March, although rainfall may be patchy in
the far south-west area. Serious flooding is likely on the
central and north coasts and in the central-west and south-
west districts. Good rains should continue in a large part of
the State during April, becoming poor during May and June.
Moderate to good rains should occur on the coast of
N.S.W. during March, with best falls around Port Mac-
quarie and from Sydney southwards. Light to moderate
patchy rains are likely in the balance of the State.
Moderate general rains are indicated during April, with
heavy falls on the central and mid-north coastal districts,
and part of the Hunter River Valley. Good rains are likely
in the second half of the year.
Victoria should get reasonably good general rains dur-
ing March, with heavier falls in the central divisions. Light
to moderate patchy rains are indicated during late autumn
and winter, though good rains may be expected from August
onwards.
In South Australia moderate rain is indicated in the
central and south-east districts and the Murray Valley dur-
ing March, but poor elsewhere. Rainfall may be patchy in
April, with good seasonal rains starting in the agricultural
areas during May.
Rainfall may be poor in Western Australia during
March, apart from good rains in the north-east and south-
east areas. Rainfall may be poor in April, with fair rains
in the s.-w. agricultural areas during May.

Prior Barley
A bit of early South Aus-
tralian farming history has just
been polished-up by the S.A.
Barley Board.
Several generations ago one
Samuel Prior arrived from
Cornwall and settled at
Brighton on a moderate-sized
farm which is now quite a
moderate-sized suburb. Here
he raised, besides a fairly large
family, a very good strain of
malting-barley, which was
called by the locals “Prior
barley.” This strain hasn’t
deteriorated ; in fact it has
been improved, and is now
recognised as one of the
world’s best malting-barleys.
The S.A. Barley Board has
recently bought a new home
for itself in Chesser Street,
Adelaide, and in memory of
the breeder of good barleys
has named the place Prior
Building, and placed therein
the only photograph of the old
gentleman which could be
found (tucked away in the
musty files of a newspaper-
office).
South Australian farmers,
particularly those around
Moonta way, have an annual
Barley Crop Competition, and
in the last competition Prior
barley was in all entries save
one.
Incidentally, board - chair-
man Martin, who has been to
Japan a number of times, says
that malt is, with rice, one
of the staple foods of that
country. After all, malt, in a
processed liquid form, is one
of our staple foods, isn’t it?
To get back to Samuel Prior,
of Brighton one daughter
aged 86 still survives and lives
in Brighton. One son, who
could not see much future in
barley-growing, entered an
entirely different sphere of
life and died in harness as
editor of The Bulletin.
Temperature and
Lambing
“Billjim”: Research at the
Kentucky University (U.S.A.)
shows that if ewes ready for
breeding are exposed to
temperatures of about 90
deg. F. their conception-rate
tends to decrease.
One group of ewes, placed
in an artificial hot-room five
days before breeding and
shorn to offset the heat, had
only 58.3 per cent, conception.
Another group, unshorn, had
38.3 per cent, conception.
The control ewes, neither
shorn nor placed in a hot-room,
produced a 92.3 per cent, con-
ception-rate—and 80 per cent,
of these went through preg-
nancy to lambing, whereas
only 10 per cent, of the shorn,
hot-room ewes lambed. None
of those unshorn in the hot-
room lambed.
Rats and Mice
“Myall”: Mice are easily
caught when traps, baited with
apple, cheese or raisins, are
set close to their usual haunts,
but rats are more wary and
will often keep clear of the
traps. To allay their suspicions,
bait the traps and leave them
unset for a few nights, then
bait and set as usual. This
will most likely succeed. Fresh
baits should be placed in the
traps daily, even if the old
ones are untouched. Always
wear gloves when handling
traps, because rodents have
a keen sense of smell
and will not touch bait
that has been handled by
humans. A sheet of paper
placed over the trap and burnt
will dispose of the taint and
the charred remains may easily
be blown away.
If trapping fails, poisoning
is the answer. When the pests
use beaten tracks, such as along
rafters and beams, or across
the floor, a band of phosphorus
rabbit- or crow-bait, spread
across the path, will prove
effective. The animals run
across the phosphorus, which
sticks to their feet, then lick it
off with fatal results. But be
very careful when handling
this substance, which is
extremely poisonous.
Of the many rat-poisons on
the market, the most satisfac-
tory is red-squill, which is
readily taken by both rats and
mice. It is available either as
powder or liquid, and bait's
may be prepared easily and
quickly on the farm. A
commonly used bait is lib.
fresh chopped meat, with loz.
powdered red-squill added
and mixed with sufficient water
to make a thin paste. Another
recipe is lib. bran, pollard or
oatmeal, mixed with loz.
powdered red-squill and made
into a crumbly mass by adding
lpint milk. If liquid red-
squill is preferred, cut ylb.
bread into yin. cubes, and soak
them in a pint of the liquid.
Procure red-squill of high
toxicity, and be careful that it
does not contaminate human
or domestic animals’ food.
Prepare baits late in the
afternoon, in quantities about
the size of a small plum. Wrap
each in a piece of paper, like
a lolly, and place them where
the rodents usually feed
Enough baits should be pre-
pared to wipe out all the rats
or mice by a single application.
All uneaten baits should be
collected next morning and
burnt. If any of the rodents
survive the treatment, allow a
fortnight or so to elapse, then
repeat the baiting. To allay
any suspicions the animals
may have, prepare the baits as
previously, but omit the red-
squill and lay them several
times at two-day intervals,
collecting any uneaten baits
next morning. The red squill
should then be added, and the
baits laid as before.
Santa Gertrudis
“S.G.”: Re Barry Kafer’s
article (B. 6/2/’57), this may
be of interest.
Donna Fi Fi, a Queensland
purebred Santa Gertrudis cow
owned by Messrs. Joyce and
Joyce, of Eidsvold station,
Eidsvold (Q.), was imported
from the Armstrong Ranch,
Texas (U.S.A.), and had her
first calf, Fi Fi 11, at 24 months
of age (the first purebred Santa
Gertrudis calf born in the
Burnett district).
Fi Fi 11, now a two-year-old,
has a six-month-old bull-calf,
Don Flamingo. Since Fi Fi IT
was calved, Donna Fi Fi has
given birth to a bull-calf, Don
Franco, now 18 months old ;
and has another bull-calf, Don
Figaro, at foot.
When weighed at Eidsvold
station early last month, Donna
Fi Fi and her family gave the

Y¥ashing Eggs
“Bilwon”: Eggs showing
rot and mould-spots are bad
for trade, repulsive to the
housewife, and a dead loss
generally. Research shows that
much of this trouble is caused
by washing eggs.
Despite what many people
think, the shell of an egg is
not solid, but honeycombed by
countless thousands of small
pores or channels. To protect
the inside of the egg from
germs which might find their
way through these small pores,
a layer of “bloom” or polish
covers the outside of the shell
and the membranes that line
it inside. When eggs are
washed, the bloom on the out-
side is removed. This exposes
the openings that connect the
various parts of the shell and
allows germs to find their way
into the egg.
As a second line of defence,
the egg contains a substance
known as “globulin GI” which
acts as a destroying-agent to
bacteria which find their way
into the egg. Normally, with
the bloom on the shell intact,
“GI” can keep the bacteria in
check. But if they invade the
inside of the egg in large
numbers, some are not
destroyed and trouble starts.
If eggs are dirty, washing
them removes the bloom, and
also helps the germs. The
dirt is dissolved into a liquid
and germs are pushed into the
open pores as the dirty water
is flushed over the surface of
the shell. Before long the
build-up of bacteria has over-
powered the “globulin GI.”
Dirty eggs must, however,
be cleaned. To avoid ruining
the egg, wait for the dirt on the
eggshell to dry, and then gently
rub it off with a wad of steel-
wool. Don’t rub too hard or
the bloom will be destroyed.
The steel-wool will soon
remove the dry dirt, and the
result will be a clean egg which
will keep without developing
rot or mould-spots.
Eggs become soiled when
laying-boxes are not cleaned
regularly or from eggs broken
by egg-eating birds. Clean out
the boxes regularly and lop off
the heads of birds that include
eggs in their diet. Simple
measures like this will cut
down the time taken in clean-
ing eggs for the market.
Clover-ley and
Cereals
“Sundowner”: Department
of Agriculture trials at
Rochester (Vic.) showed an
increased yield of three bags
to the acre from wheat grown
on fallow after two years under
sub.-clover pasture. Grain
grown on clover-land also con-
tained | per cent, more protein
than grain from crops on
regularly used land.
This is significant in view of
the considerable amount of
low-protein wheat produced
in Victoria. Dwalganup was
used in the trials, though
Bacchus Marsh clover had
given more prolific growth.
Fourteen different wheats
were tested. This summer’s
highest yields came from two
unnamed varieties, one of them
an Olympic selection. Among
named wheats, Olympic yielded
more to the acre than
Insignia and Beacon. Olympic,
Insignia and Pinnacle are
varieties recommended for the
northern areas of the State,
but returns from Pinnacle were
disappointing.
The trials also showed that
a higher application-rate of
super, pays dividends on red-
brown soils. Up to an
acre can be used to advantage.
Asian and Middle East
Markets
“P.K.H.”: The article by
R. E. G. Cunningham (B.
7/1/’59), dealing with the
potential opening for Aus-
tralian mutton in Asian
markets, could hardly have
been published at a more
opportune time.
It would be pretty safe to
say that at present every sheep-
man in Australia is wonder-
ing how he is going to make
ends meet, owing to the low
in wool prices and high in cost
of production. Irrespective of
the adverse effect present
prices are having on the
economy of our country, I
think the time has come for
us to remove some of our eggs
from the one basket.
Throughout our history we
have been pretty snug, thanks
mainly to our wool (may it
be so). But unfortu-
nately the boom period has
also made us pretty smug. So
unless there is some drastic
reduction in costs, or reason-
able increase in wool prices,
the sheep-man is going to find
himself in a pretty awkward
position.
Cunningham has suggested
one channel through which the
position could be eased to the
benefit of the individual, as
well as the country as a whole.
He seems well versed about
Asian markets, and says that,
as a countryman, he would be
glad to know more about the
set-up he has suggested. Could
he, perhaps, answer a few
questions—such as:
_ Why has Moree (N.S.W.)
been singled-out as a centre?
Is he interested enough him-
self to try to further such a
scheme by approaching bodies
like the Graziers’ Association,
as well as the Ministers for
Trade of the various countries
mentioned, and the trade-
unions (about employment of
Moslems in Australia)?
In forming such a co-
operative body as he suggests,
has he given any thought as to
the financing of the initial
investigating committee, and
where this finance would come
from?
Meantime, more power to
Cunningham and his pro-
gressive ideas.
Farm Hints
“Van”: For feeding poultry,
greenfeed gives the most
economic results, although
demanding more labor than
vitamin-powders. But research
has shown that greenfeed cut
the day before feeding-out
loses much of its vitamin-A.
In fact, if this practice is
followed regularly, it could
easily lead to a vitamin defi-
ciency—even if fed in large
quantities.

Life-spun of the pawpaw-tree ?
A tropical tree of medium heignt,
it needs a not climate with pieniy
of water and good soil, and under
favorable conditions might be
expected to live and thrive tor about
20 years. Frost and drougnt some-
times shorten its life, lhe Sydney
area is ratner far south for it,
though it will grow in very
favored sunny spots. As soon
as the tree shows sign of age
(smaller fruit or lesser crops) new
plants should be set out to replace
it. Usually the tree is dioecious,
with male and female flowers on
separate plants; two are required
to ensure pollination.

What is the value of electro-
cardiograph treatment for horses ?
(From J. D. Steel, acting head of
the Department of Veterinary
Medicine, University of Sydney.)
Two separate pieces of informa-
tion can be obtained from the
cardiogram. First, it is possible to
estimate whether a horse has a
large heart, a medium-sized heart
or a small heart. Second, it is pos-
sible to tell whether the heart-
muscle is healthy or diseased. This
information is useful when assess-
ing a horse’s racing potentialities,
when planning a racing-programme
and when considering the type of
training or racing tactics that
might suit a horse best. The esti-
mate of heart-size is expressed by
giving each horse a figure-rating
known as a “heart-score.” This
can vary from 86 to 146. The relia-
bility of heart-score as a guide and
the question of exceptions is com-
plicated by a number of factors.
A good racehorse must have suit-
able size and conformation, a good
gait, good breathing capacity, good
temperament and a good heart.
Complications of the exception
problem arise from the way in
which the racing programmes are
organised and from the general
calibre of the horses available and
eligible to compete in the various
events. A good horse may appear
outstanding, or a moderate horse
good, when the standard of the
opposition is poor.
Racehorses frequently suffer from
slight degrees of heart-disease.
When the cardiogram indicates that
a horse has the heart-disease known
as myocarditis it will not race as
well as the heart-score would nor-
mally suggest. As to the limita-
tions of cardiography, the informa-
tion obtained from a cardiogram is
not a substitute for normal methods
o': assessing a horse’s capabilities;
it is not a substitute for good train-
ing and driving. A good heart is
of no avail when other factors such
as a rough gait or bad barrier
manners place the horse at a dis-
advantage. Similarly, it will not
overcome the disability imposed by
unsound limbs, heavy worm-
infestation or wind defects. When
they understand the implications of
the cardiograph owners and trainers
“I feel Well —but he's been Waiting there for the last
three days , so I thought I'd better SEE YOU, Doctor."
augment the pattern of knowledge
they must have if they hope to get
the best out of their horses.

Biographical details of Neville
Cayley ?
Born at Yamba, Clarence River,
N.S.W., on January 7, 1887. His
father was well known for his
paintings of game-birds and kooka-
burras, etc., and the son followed
in his footsteps, with one important
deviation —he stressed ornitholo-
gical rather than artistic values in
his painting. In 1925 he produced
some attractive plates for the first
Australian Encyclopaedia (1925-27),
and in this edition both he and his
father were represented.
In that period and later N. W.
Cayley was the chief painter of
Australian birds. He made many
drawings for scientific publications
and for popular purposes, but his
most distinctive and influential
work was done through the medium
of books. The first of these, wholly
written and illustrated by Cayley,
was What Bird Is That? (1931), in
which every Australian bird
appeared in color with appropriate
condensed text. His other books
include Australian Finches in Bush
and Aviary (1932), Budgerigars in
Bush and Aviary (1933), Australian
Parrots (1938) and The Fairy Wrens
of Australia (1949). Cayley also
did the color drawings for G. A.
Waterhouse’s What Butterfly Is
That? (1932) and the figures in E.
Troughton’s Furred Animals of
Australia (1941). He died in Sydney
on March 17, 1950.
Brief AnsWers
J.G.P.: As far as is known,
there are no restrictions on starting
such a library, but it might be an
idea to consult your police-depart-
ment. The outlook is not encourag-
ing, since free libraries of good
quality are being established by
local councils. There would be
severe competition, and you would
need to advertise extensively, or
circularise likely subscribers: a
fairly heavy outlay of capital seems
certain.... “Enquirer” : Hard to
give useful advice on the matter;
first, don’t send any of the articles
for valuation—keep them until you
get an offer. Suggest you write
a full description of the various
groups and send to W. E. Bradshaw,
96 Queen Street, Woollahra,
Sydney, for a preliminary report.
The Museum of Applied Arts and
Sciences, Ultimo, Sydney, might
also be able to help you, and an
ad. in the Saturday issue of a city
daily could well lead to something.
. ...5.0.: There was no “impound-
ing” of woolgrowers’ profits in
those years. Taxation Departments
are not empowered to adjudge the
profits made by any particular sec-
tion of the community to be
“excessive,” and therefore cannot
tax at a higher rate —unless the
individual gees into a higher tax-
able group. However, woolmen
were hit hard by “provisional tax”

seed, t00....5.5.: It is likely that
a tree struck by lightning would be

As Kangaroo did laze,
With bleaching bones around,
The heat rose in a haze
From barren stony ground,

Was under the She-oak tree.
And looking nearly beat,
A timid rabbit came
To shelter from the heat,
And energies reclaim,
Reviving rapidly
Beneath the She-oak tree.
A snake came slithering
Towards the She-oak shade;
A kookaburra's raid
Caught snake a-dithering,
And broke his back in three,
Under the She-oak tree.

And reached in for his mail.

Women's Letters
SYDNEY.
Sydney people, sad to say, tend to take
for granted many of their great institu-
tions, such as the Royal Hospital
for Women, merely because they are
an established part of the city life.
Actually the hospital, together with Ren-
wick Hospital for Infants and Scarba
Home for Children, is run by the
Benevolent Society of N.S.W., which this
week held its 146th annual meeting. The
Governor, Sir Eric Woodward, who was
present with Lady Woodward (every
N.S.W. Governor since Macquarie in
1813 has attended these meetings), said
he thought the deficit of £13,000 small
in a society with such ramifications, but
Mr. Victor Segal, who as treasurer con-
sidered himself responsible for “a note
of gloom,” said that the deficit was one
that the society could not afford, and
that help from the public was vitally
necessary.
Bishop Hilliard, with a succession of
witty stories, lightened the atmosphere
once more, his most apposite story being
of the little boy who reported: “The kids
asked me at school where I was born,
but I didn’t like to say the Women’s Hos-
pital because it sounded so sissy. So I
said the Stadium!”

A centre in some beautiful bushland
place where one could see represented all
things essentially Australian —flowers,
animals, art and culture generally —has
been for years the dream of artist Mary
Edwell-Burke, and a meeting convened
during the week by Mr. H. E. Best,
director of the Department of Tourist
Activities, agreed that such a centre
would be thoroughly worth while. It
would prove “a great teacher, through
art, of what is here to love and protect,”
in Mrs. Edwell-Burke’s words ; and to
tourists, of course, 1 it would be a great
attraction.
It was agreed at the meeting that an
Australian Centre Association should be
formed, and a precise scheme will be
drawn-up by a select committee headed
by Mr. A. A. Strom, N.S.W. Chief
Guardian of Fauna. The committee also
includes Mrs. Edwell-Burke, Alderman
A. J. Hand (Blue Mountains City Coun-
cil), Mr. L. W. Henderson and Mrs. Dora
Joy. The idea is one that will appeal to
all who love Australia and wish to see
its beauties preserved and made known.

Such a first-night for the. Sabrina show
at the Tivoli! What with the bands play-
ing and the marching-girls and the Bondi
lifesavers and the milling crush and the
excitement, the atmosphere was vibrant
with gaiety and anticipation. Don’t ask
what anyone was wearing, the crowd was
so thick that one could not see anything
below chin-level. On the stage, however,
Sabrina wore some fabulous garments,
and by sheer glamor outshone everybody
else there. It’s remarkable.

Pause for a chuckle. A woman asked
the liftman at David Jones’ Elizabeth
Street store for refrigerators. “In our
George Street store, madam,” said the
liftman. “George Street?” said the
woman, bewildered. “Oh, yes, I know.
That's near D.J.’s, isn’t it?”
Mrs. Sylvia Mogford, president of the
N.S.W. Women's Bowling Association, is
N.S.W. manager for the 384 women who
are taking part in the Australian bi-
annual bowling carnival now being held
in Hobart. She has organised all the
travelling bookings and accommodation
in Hobart, where the carnival will last
for three weeks. Most of the women
bowlers travelled over by the Orion and
will return by air, and many of them are
accompanied by their husbands. Mrs.
Mogford has had extensive experience in
this type of organisation, as she was
manager for N.S.W. for previous inter-
state carnivals in Queensland, S.A., Vic-
toria and W.A. during her term of office
as social chairwoman of the association.

Furs calculated to make one discon-
tented with one’s old bit of fox or

week. For glamor there was an
Edwardian boa in sky-blue Arctic-fox,
or an apricot suede jacket with apricot-
dyed Arctic-fox. For style there was a
mink pullover, Persian-lamb dyed beige-
rose or midnight-blue, and one facecloth
coat in the red the Queen wears for the
Trooping of the Color, its collar Persian-
lamb dyed to match. There is a vicuna-
cloth coat (£3 per inch, my dear!)
trimmed with wild-mink, chinchilla allied
to black Russian broadtail and “moon-
light” mink (a pale-mauve) if you are
looking for richness. Lynx is a new

The world-famous “Family of Man”
photographic exhibition has at last come
to Australia, and the official opening by
the Governor has been arranged for
Tuesday, April 7, at David Jones’. The
exhibition includes 503 pictures from 68
countries and emphasises with dramatic
vigor the universality of human activity.
It is to be shown in Sydney in aid of
the Family Welfare Bureau, with Sir John
Northcott as chairman of the central
committee and Mr. Hal Missingham in
charge of assembling the exhibition.

The only people who seemed to have
a good word for the recent humid
weather were the British migrants
who had arrived a few days before under
the “Bring Out a Briton” campaign of
the Royal Commonwealth Society, and
who were entertained by the society at
luncheon. Mr. and Mrs. George Viner,
from High Wycombe, said they “loved
the weather” (this was before the cyclone,
admittedly), while Miss Lily Atkinson
(Durham) and Miss Vicki Bensley (Lon-
don) admired the “smart modern shops.”
Portsmouth boys Ray Godfrey, Maurice
Toovey and Tom Rogers said they had
been attracted by the “bigness” of Aus-
tralia, which they hoped would give them
a chance to “lose the cramped feeling,”
but they all said the weather was grand.

a full page or two are devoted to
Wolsey himself. Froude did the back-
ground much better and in a much
shorter space and without the many
doubtful but positive judgments of
men and things which Ferguson reels
off too confidently.
His picture of the age of the Wars
of the Roses, informed by an assump-
tion that it convulsed the whole realm
down to the humblest serf, is no more
accurate than his description of
Wolsey at one point as an Ipswich
“yokel.” He might just as well have
applied the same description to the
highly educated son of a leading
country-town storekeeper, grazier or
butcher in some Victorian coastal port.
When Ferguson gets down to his
personal narrative of Wolsey’s politi-
cal life his writing becomes more con-
nected and germane to the subject, but
there is little new or illuminating. It
is difficult to know how authentic his
facts are in many cases, especially
when they do not coincide with the
hitherto accepted ones. His reference-
notes are not helpful.
He states positively, for instance,
that Wolsey was born in 1471, whereas
the “Dictionary of National Biography”
and other authorities plump for 1475;
but he does not give the source of his
information, which certainly was not
the registers of Ipswich, since they do
not exist. This re-dating of his subject’s
life has all sorts of complications,
since it causes events in some of his
early days, which are most obscure, to
assume new backgrounds.
He shows, too, a bias in favor of his
subject and a failure to attempt
explanations of startling and sudden
changes in fortune which affected
Wolsey in his earlier days.
When, for instance, Sir Amyas
Paulet, one of the western sheriffs and
commissioners dealing with the after-
maths of Perkin Warbeck’s rebellion,
put “Father Wolsey” of the small
village of Limington into the stocks,
Ferguson is no more ready to admit any
possibility of wrong-doing by the vic-
tim than he is to make reference to the
fact that his hero’s earlier deposition
from the senior bursarship of Magda-
len was due to misapplication of funds
of the college to the part-building of
the Great Tower.
He dismisses it as highly improb-
able that Wolsey had been “guilty of
excessive gaiety, that he grew drunk
and disorderly at a country fair....
and pinched maidenly bottoms.”
He says that there is not a shred of
record to support the tale and nothing
to lend it plausibility. Except, of
course, that that was the sort of
offence for which persons got put in
stocks. He feels the incident of the
arrest bears “all the marks of an
officious and vindictive act beyond the
line of duty.” And he does not com-
plete the tale by recording that many
years later Wolsey, when powerful, got
his own back on the unfortunate Paulet
by placing him under house-arrest in
his chambers for several years.
There are many mysteries about
Wolsey which Ferguson has failed to
solve. Why did a fellow and bursar
of Magdalen accept a not very lucra-
.. *ii c r • • *
ttve hying in the village of Limmgton
from the Greys? How did he make
the sudden jump from country parson,
ordained in 1498, to become one of
the two influential chaplains of the
Archbishop of Canterbury in 1501?
These queries stimulate a curiosity
which has yet to be satisfied. Possibly
it was a mere matter of personality and
ability, but it is difficult to imagine
Wolsey as a man of really strong and
independent character.
He survived as long as he did only
through his limpet attachment to
Henry VIII, who saved him in the
end from the Act of Attainder of the
Lords. The latter were only too ready
to destroy one who had conciliated
the rich middle-classes, while acting as
the alter ego of the proudest and
showiest monarch in Europe, emulat-
ing him in lavishness from a wealth
acquired with startling suddenness, the
evidences of which exist in his founda-
tions and in Hampton Court, which
was only one of his many palaces.
The best and most revealing part of
his story is in his period of eclipse,
when he had been sent to Esher, de-
prived of his Archbishopric of York
and his many offices but comforted
by the interlude of the arrival of Sir
Henry Norris, spurring hard to assure
him of the King’s favor.
He may have been “the proudest
prelate that ever breathed,” as Giusti-
niani, the Venetian Ambassador, de-
clared, but on that occasion he presents
himself as a weak, avaricious and
sycophantic figure:—
“He lighted off his mule all
a10ne.... and incontinent kneeled
down upon the dirt on both his
knees, holding up his hands for joy”
and he tried to get off his undercap
of red velvet so that he might kneel
bareheaded. But it was tied in a
knot under his chin, which he could
not undo in his impatience. Violently
he broke the laces and tore the cap
from his head, uncovered in the sight
of God and in memory of his king,
Then, having remounted his mule
out 0 f t h e d irt } n t h e road near
Putney, with the same agility as before,
he searched round for some token to
send to King Henry in return for his
sovereign’s reassuring signet-ring,
what was there left t 0 him? Noth .

CAPTAIN SVENSON
Lying in the hospital I heard the white-
veiled sisters neigh
Tossing their veils like fillies, stepping
high
On the long bright shiny floors. Oh, I
heard them whinny and say —
Captain Svenson will be admitted
Monday,
Captain Svenson has rung to know
Does his room have a view of the Harbor,
Can he listen on the radio?
The yacht-race starts on Wednesday
morning —
Oh, and Sister, Sister, Sister,
The Mariners’ League is on the phone,
When is the Captain’s operation?
Tell them Tuesday, early in the morning.
And I thought: has he strayed from a
Slessor poem?
The white-maned sisters prance like fillies
On neat white hooves from room to room
With trays, thermometers, letters, flowers,
Sharp, sharp scissors and cotton-wool.
Limp as a drowned man down in the
theatre
The Captain lies where he’d rather not be.
Someone listens to his ticking heart-
beats ;
The surgeon is snipping : one, two, three.
Back in a trice on a trolley goes the
Captain,
Back to his room with a wink of the sea.
I lie on my bed and I think of the Captain
While the sisters whinny outside my door,
Their white manes tossing like waves of
the sea.
Do waves of pain wash over you, Captain,
A nd do you fear you are like to die?
Sister ! What of Captain Svenson?
Kindly give the message that Captain
Svenson
Passed a comfortable night, and is now
as well —
As well, that is, as can be expected.
He holds a telescope up to the window
And rolls an eye as blue as the sea.
When I took his pulse a moment ago
Sister, Sister, how he looked at me!
Oh, Sister, Sister. Oh, Sister, Oh !

Available from all booksellers and . . .
ANGUS & ROBERTSON LTD.,
89-95 Castlereagh Street, Sydney
age in which the Cardinal Archbishop
of York was twice rejected for the
Papacy after having scarcely gained a
vote, to the intense relief of the popu-
lace of Rome, which hated to see
foreigners elected. Foreigners had no
palaces in Rome which might be
looted as those of successful Papal
candidates invariably were to the last
farina in the kitchen.
Ferguson may or may not be right
in believing that in finally recalling
Wolsey to London after he had
resumed his office in York, Henry
personally intended to betray and
destroy him. His destruction in any
case would have come within a few
years, during the heat of the campaign
against the monasteries and the pillage
of the wealth of the Church. He prob-
ably was fortunate to have died when
he did on his way to London under
guard in the Abbey of St. Mary of the
Meadows near Leicester. He-has also
been fortunate in having a Shakspeare
to embalm his memory.
Ferguson has not added much to
our knowledge of Wolsey, but he has
concentrated into a very readable book
a good deal about him which was
scattered through English historical
literature.
E.
Johnson and Boswell
Boswell is so busy publishing on
his own account these days that, to
say nothing of all that has already
been written on the subject, Hesketh
Pearson is up against pretty stiff com-
petition in his Johnson and Boswell
(Heinemann); and it is hard to admit
the publisher’s claim that this is the
first book to tell the story of both
their lives, since all books about either
of them inevitably discuss both.
Readers familiar with Boswell’s
journals will find their chief interest
here in the odd bits of information
which Pearson has picked-up from
Mrs. Piozzi and other less-familiar
diarists, or the stray details which are
always likely to be forgotten: how the
infant Samuel, for instance, was so
sickly and repellent a little object that
his aunt said she wouldn’t have picked
him up if riie had found him in the
street; how Johnson in his boyhood,
with a modesty he was never subse-
quently to recapture, used to climb a
tree to avoid being forced to entertain
visitors; and, more importantly, how
Lucy Porter, otherwise Tetty, his wife,
was quite a charming and vivacious
creature when he married her, though
afterwards she took to drink and drugs.
It is pleasing to learn that Johnson,
when he was writing for
man’s Magazine,” invented several of
the speeches for which Pitt the Elder
somewhat unjustly became famous;
and it is instructive, if only grimly
pleasing, to be reminded of Savage’s
savage mother, who, not wishing to be
embarrassed by her illegitimate son,
did her best to get him hanged.
There are, too, copious notes on
such estimable minor characters as
Mrs. Levett, who, living in a small
coal-shed in Fetter Lane, persuaded
Levett that she was the dispossessed
relative of a rich man, but, shortly after
her marriage, turned out to be a pros-
titute and a pickpocket; and Francis
Barber, Johnson’s negro servant, who
married a white girl and was fiercely
jealous of her at dances—though, since
he was once pursued from Lincoln-
shire to London by an infatuated
female haymaker, Mrs. Barber had
rather more cause to be jealous of
him.
But, in spite of such touches, and
the occasional heightening of interest
to be gained from the grouping together
of some of Johnson’s eccentricities—
the time he climbed the iron gate and
the time he rolled down the hill—it
cannot really be said that Pearson has
sufficient novelty to satisfy the reader’s
vague, continuing wonder as to why he
is being told the same old story over
again. Pearson goes quietly, lucidly
and on the whole good-humoredly
through Boswell’s journals, and if you
gain something in a complete and
balanced picture you miss the verve of
the originals. You miss, too, the
understanding of Boswell as an artist,
which the thunder of his journals is
making increasingly necessary and
which alone could give freshness to a
biography and make sense of the
inconsistencies of his character which
Pearson stresses so much.
Play Competition
Closing-date for entries in the
“Australian Play Quest” of the Mel-
bourne Little Theatre Guild and
J.C.W. has been changed from March
1 to May I—“ There1 —“There have been so
many requests from intending entrants
for a little more time.”
Reviewed Briefly
The Marriage: Mona Williams
(Cassell). The speed with which an
apparently happy marriage can disin-
tegrate is convincingly shown in this
novel of temperament and character.
The people concerned are well-to-do
Americans whose only barrier to
happiness, the man’s jealous possessive-
ness, is offset by his wife’s gentle
acceptance of it. Once she makes a
challenge, however, the whole struc-
ture of their family life begins to
crumble. Their story is told with skill
and understanding.
* * * *
Family Secret: Janet Agle (Con-
stable). The family concerned is
wealthy and widespread and regulates
its members according to the teaching
of its 14th century founder. The
women are gay and modern, though
absolutely virtuous, and respect the
medieval ideas held by the family re-
garding the relationship of the sexes.
The men are high-minded and respon-
sible, though their attitude towards the
women who are outside the family is
not so edifying. The story is enter-
taining enough but the theory seems
superficially developed.
* * * *
Love and the Princess: Lucille
Iremonger (Faber). Around an old
scandal concerning the Princess
Sophia, daughter of George 111, Mrs.
Iremonger has written an interesting
account of the origin of the Royal
Marriages Act of 1772. Despite the
impressive research that has gone into
the book, its approach is highly per-
sonal and feminine. It is the personali-
ties of the princess and her sisters which
are emphasised and their frustrated
loves, pathetic and unromantic as they
were, contribute something to the pic-
ture of the times. Mrs. Iremonger’s
style is somewhat gushing and gaudy,
but she has gathered a great deal of
information in respect of the parentage
of that Thomas Garth who black-
mailed the royal family in 1827 and
there is a certain detective - story
excitment in her book.

The best way to avoid being trapped
when buying tyres is to know what
goes into them. Then you can assess
what you’ll get out of the tyres. Only
Goodyear tyres have 3-T cord -
cord that is triple tempered at a
precise Tension, at a pre-determined
Temperature, for a definite Time.
3-T is the strongest tyre cord in the
world giving you, in Goodyear
tyres, the safest, longest-lasting tyres
you can buy.
HERE’S WHY YOU ARE SAFER ON 3-T TYRES
In strength lies safety and Goodyear 3-T cord is the
strongest tyre cord in the world! The chance of bruise
breaks and consequent blowouts is materially reduced.
Tyre heat greatest cause of premature tyre failure
is reduced to a minimum by 3-T cord.
HERE’S WHY YOU GET MORE MILES FROM 3-T TYRES
The extra strength of 3-T cord means Goodyear tyres
meet modern highway conditions better give
thousands of extra miles. The stronger body carries
the new, tougher X*M tread rubber giving up to
20% more miles on the original tread and allows
more recaps.
Since the extra value, extra safety of Goodyear 3-T
Tyres cost no more to buy . . . insist on Goodyear!
