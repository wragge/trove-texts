This Blacking is in liquid form and is applied to shoes
or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attacheu
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by
anyone without soiling the lingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

I Dr. M. PEEEY,
M.E.C.S., L.S.A , Ac.,
SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Board of N.S. W. Late House Sur-
geon to the Great Northern Hospital, London
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
Of professional etiquette by advertising- myself as a
Specialist for the treatment of this class of disease, but,
Unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Til graph, Nov.
6th 7th and Sth, lSln>) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in wlfch patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from the e diseases, who are scattered over nil parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified i’raclUiouer
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists, hut I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
My (Jaaliflcatlon* I invite the fullest Investigation into. For some considerable time X was House Surgeon to the
Groat Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of oi servin ; the many plioses of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to heroine acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at ihe
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
if I under t dee the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

Of Men and Women in the leading Medical Schools and
Hospitals of Groat Britain, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and
in private practice. Formerly House Surgeon to the
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Maternity and Lock Hospitals.
No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can he compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the
ONLY LEG ALLY QUALIFIED DOCTOR
advertising in those colonies who combines with special
Knowledge Honest Treatment, as may easily be ascer-
tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony'.
No diseases causa so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old.
Sulfurii g from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul month, costiveness, palpi-

diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility, premature decay,stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS IIEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at adistance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-

UNCLEAN LEGISLATORS.
“ When commenting recently upon the position in which the O’Shea
disclosures placed Mr. Parnell we expressed satisfaction at the giowth
of a public opinion which refused to accept public sen ices, however
eminent, in eondoneraent of criminal personal conduct. . . . And
public opinion is perfectly right. .... The public verdict in the
cases of Dilke and Parnell emphatically assorts that morality must in
future be as essential to public life as ability, and that the absence of
the one cannot be compensated for by the presence of the other. Ihe
strong public sentiment which in England lately has been pronouncing
inexorable ostracism against transgressors ,of tie moral code is based
on an increased understanding of .ethical morality,. The feeling which
underlies it is not only abhorrence of criminality per se, but a right
apprehension of the fact that one who is guilty of private transgression
cannot be trusted with the conscientious discharge of public duties.
. . , . It is a pretty safe maxim that whoever will deal selfishly
and dishonestly with his fellow-men ?is individuals will do the tame
with them as a whole when the opportunity presents itself. To place
in positions of supreme trust as law-makers and custodians of public
finances men who cannot in .their own personal affairs present a clean
record is about the same as to choose bank-managers from among
known pickpockets The doors of Parliament should stand
firmly closed against the trickster whose career has led him to them
through a course of dishonest a,nd dubious actions . . . and to the
foul and lecherous creature whose domestic conduct is a blot and a dis-
grace upon the society which his presence pollutes. • • • • We are
not so short of men or of manhood in N.S. Wales as to be forced to
seek law-makers in the ranks of hypocritical . . . adulterers. The
people must insist more than they have yet done upon getting repre-
sentatives conduct is able to bear daylight upon it in every par-
ticular either in or out of Parliament. _ We want honest and trust-
worthy men to make our laws, not salacious reprobates .... or
unscrupulous scoundrels.” — Sydney Ministerial Organ, 2Gth Feb.,
1891.

SATURDAY, MARCH 7, 1891.
Commercial Depression.
For several years past the world of alleged
civilisation has been suffering from a bad
attack of Commercial Depression. Man is
at present desperately hard-up; He is only
a shade lower than the angels, but to a large
extent he is sleeping in boilers on the wharf.
The disease from which he is suffering is a
species of unaccountable and impalpable
curse, which comes from no visible place,
and arises from no visible source, and is
governed by no recognised laws, and which
goes as fitfully and as mysteriously as it
comes. It is generally alluded to as dullness
of trade, though why trade is dull no one
can tell ; there are upwards of a dozen con-
tradictory explanations of the phenomenon,
and they are all about equally unreasonable.
But regarding the result there can be no
manner of doubt ; from China to Peru and
from the Cape of Good Hope to Archangel the
worker is hard-up, and work is scarce,
and wages are tending downward, and
the unemployed, who are numerous
even in periods of alleged prosperity, are
very much more numerous in this period of
conspicuous adversity. The curse of com-
mercial depression is everywhere, save in
those happy lands where there is no com-
merce to be depressed, and no rent, and no
landlords, and no employers, and no capital,
and where the blessed savage prospects for
fish and bananas, and enjoys the sunlight in
happy ignorance of the fact that trade is
falling off. Yet even there the ominous
preacher is busy spreading civilisation, and
teaching the native how to be thrown out by
his landlord when he is sick and can’t raise
the money for the rent, and how to be run
in by the policeman when he is hard-up, and
how to be sent to gaol by the magistrate
when he doesn’t “ keep off the grass,” and
in a general way he is conferring on the
untutored aborigine the blessings of com-
mercial depression. But as to the remedy
of this mysterious evil, the wastes and
deserts of orthodoxy have never yet grown
any specific which promises the slightest
relief ; it is vaguely assumed that depression
comes by the act and dispensation of Puovi-
I'KNCB, which is another way of assuming
that Providence is depressed, and there the
matter rests.
# # #
That wildly uncertain influence known as
over-production is, however, the cause most
commonly ascribed when the world is a little
more conspicuously hard-up than usual.
That is to say, that the world produces too
much wealth in the shape of food, clothing,
find alj other kinds of necessaries and
luxuries, and because it has produced too
much wealth, therefore it becomes poor. A
presumably sane and intelligent population
iccepts this as a perfectly reasonable theory,
owing chiefly to that dismal ignorance that
Makes every population believe whatever it
is told to believe, if the statement is only
loud enough and made with sufficient energy.
No doubt if it was announced that any single
individual was starving through having made
too much money, or had been burnt to
death through falling up a cataract, there
would be a general impression that some-
thing had gone wrong ; but when it tran-
spires that three-fourths of civilised huma-
nity are in terrible straits through having
created too much riches, the fact is ac-
cepted as a natural and inevitable state
of things which must not be questioned,
for fear of irritating Providence. If
the world produced too much goods, then
it ought, in all reason, to be too rich instead
of too poor; the man who suffers from
over-production either of money or of
money’s worth should be a millionaire in-
stead of a pauper ; but the unemployed and
unshod shoemaker is in his present lament-
able condition because the world has too
many boots, and when it has too many boots
somehow it can’t get boots ; and the tattered
tailor, who is out of a job, is short of clothes
because of the over-production of clothes.
And in like manner the starving agricul-
turist is hungry and empty because of the
superfluity of food—in fact, the whole theory
of over-production is a plan by which the
effect shoves the cause backward, and the
consequence abolishes its own origin—a
scheme whereby the worker is poor when he
produces little, and poorer still if he pro-
duces much, and if he produces very much
he is then poorest of all. In short, the
assertion that the working masses are
reduced to extreme misery by the over-
production of wealth in any form—whether
as money or as goods—is not only a glaring
lie ; it is also as ghastly an absurdity as the
assertion that thirst arises from the glut of
fresh water, or that drowning is generally
brought about by the pressure of too much
dry land.
* * *
The misery that prevails among the poor
in times of commercial depression arises
simply from the fact that the worker is the
only individual in the whole range of
humanity who has no recognised right to
exist except when his employer has a profit-
able use for him—in his own individual
capacity he has no right to exist at all. In
the intervals of feverish prosperity which
precede most periods of scarcity, the toiler is
urged on to produce in three years enough
to supply the world’s requirements for five,
and when the day of glutted markets arrives
he is sent adrift. A horse, in such a case, is
turned out to grass ; a human being is
turned out without the grass. If the owner
of the horse, in a period of commercial de-
pression, ejects his steed to starve on a
macadamised road, the animal is not said to
be suffering from over-production ; he
is suffering from the inhumanity of
his proprietor, and that individual is
promptly fined or sent to gaol ; and
the virtual owper of the man is not
tined in like manner simply because the
horse has a right to live somewhere or some-
how, whether his services are required or
not, and the human employe has no such
right. He has produced wealth—too much
wealth according to the grand old economic
theory—for his owner ;he has received no
share of that wealth, except what was neces-
sary to keep him in working condition for
his employer’s benefit ; and then he is thrown
out till he is wanted again. If he is dead
before he is wanted again his owner can get
another man without any extra charge. And
in the intervals of spasmodic production the
toiler occupies a strange position, for he has
no right to live without working, and he has
no right to work till the capitalist has a new'
demand for him ; he has no right to live on
the land because it belongs to the landlord,
and he has no right to loaf on the street
because the policeman bids him “ move on ”
—in fact, he has absolutely no rights ot any
kind apart from his employer. He is a victim
of circumstances certainly, but not in the com-
monly accepted sense ; it is not customary,
for instance, to say that the individual who is
run down by a furious driver is crushed by
the over-production of cabs, or that the per-
son who is eaten by a cannibal is a victim of
the inevitable over-production of hungry
aborigines. He merely sutlers from the fact
that a stony system of monopoly has made it
impossible for a man without capital to earn
his livelihood except at the pleasure and con-
venience of an employer, who chooses at
times to make him produce too much and
refuses at other times to let him produce at
all, just as he thinks fit; and if this is suffer-
ing through over-production and consequent
depression of trade, then the man who is
drowning in a well, and is dependent for his
means of getting out on the man who stands
on the top with a rope, is in trouble from
exactly the same cause. But if the man at
the top finds it more profitable not to lower
(he rope, that circumstance is not generally
called depression of trade ; the law- uses
strong language in such a case, and resorts
to strong measures.
* # #
This simile is not in any sense strained or
overdrawn, for in every country which is
overshadowed by the curso of civilisation the
man without capital is absolutely and utterly
dependent on his employer. He cannot
resort to the land for a livelihood, for it is
the property of the landlord; he cannot start
a store or a workshop, for the ground it is
built upon must be paid for ; he cannot fish
or hunt without trespassing on private pro-
perty —he can do nothing in fact, save work
for some capitalist, for a thousand different
monopolies have combined to crush out every
opportunity which once existed by which
any man devoid of property could earn an
independent livelihood. And, therefore, the
men who hold and enjoy these monopolies
are morally bound to find employment for
the whole human race, as the only possible
reason or excuse for the privileges which they
enjoy. So far, however, they have succeeded,
by the great principle of shifting the responsi-
bility and passing on the blame, in dodging
this gigantic liability. In a country, for in-
stance, where there are ten million people,
and ten thousand monopolists appropriate
among them the land, money, machinery,
and every other source of livelihood, it is
difficult to fix the exact responsibility, and
exceedingly hard to hang the right mono-
polist ; yet for every individual who dies of
want and misery in the slums of London or
Glasgow or New York, some monopolist
ought, while capital punishment exists, cer-
tainly to be hanged if he could only be
found. If instead of ten thousand capitalists
and landholders possessing ail the resources
of ten million people there were one thou-
sand inhabitants planted, without any possi-
bility of escape upon an island, where one
solitary plutocrat owned the land, the houses,
money, machinery, fisheries, and all other
industry, the question would be easy of solu-
tion. The great law that he who will not
work must perish would remain in force just
the same, but when only one man could
supply the work he must either do so or
abdicate his position, or be deposed, or
hanged. His proposition of the aggregate
profit and the aggregate responsibility
would be as before, and his right to re-
fuse employment and allow the other inha-
bitants to starve by reason of over-produc-
tion, or depression of trade, would remain
unimpaired ; but if he failed to provide em-
ployment, and yet made it impossible for
anyone else to provide it, his funeral would
be very close at hand, and no doctrine
of political economy could stop it.
* # #
Yet this dull and ignorant world has not
yet realised that the monopolists, who have
made the whole race of workers dependent
on them by annexing the land and every
other source of wealth, are thereby bound to
find work and sustenance for the whole
human family, just as the monopolist who
seizes the only well in a thirsty desert is
morally bound to supply water to the other
inhabitants. Consequently it drivels at
banquets and complimentary feeds about the
virtues of the great land-stealer who has
“furnished employment” to a few of his
fellow-creatures, instead of braining the
land-stealer who does not furnish employ-
ment on a charge of attempted murder by
slow starvation ; and when the employment
gives out, and wages sink to zero, and star-
vation is everywhere, the result is set down
to over-production, or “depression of
trade.” Trade has now been depressed for
a good many years, yet the aggregate of the
world’s commerce has kepi on expanding as
it always does whether trade is depressed or
not. Also manufactures have continued to
grow, though not so rapidly as before, and
the dividends of banks and finance-com-
panies have risen almost as much as usual,
and shipping has multiplied ; in fact, depres-
sion simply means that monopolies have in-
creased slowly instead of increasing with
frenzied haste. And, as for rent, in the
aggregate it has gone up as usual, for rent
never stops by any human possibility. If
rents and land-values, dividends, reserve
funds, and all the other perquisites of capital
dropped in the same ratio as wagesj then the
difference between periods of commercial
prosperity and periods of adversity, so far as
the workers are concerned, would be hardly
perceptible. Some day, it may be, a great,
universal labour league and monopoly will
succeed in shifting the burden, and then the
first symptom of depression will be a reduc-
tion of rent instead of wages, and the useless
landlord will be locked-out instead of the
useful worker, and the term “ working half-
time ” will mean that the proprietor will
receive his rent for only three days in each
week, and then the toiler instead of the
gilded loafer will hold meetings of sympathy,
and urge the landlord to pray for better
times, and to bear up against the affliction
which arises out of the inscrutable ways of
Providence.
* # #
Such a change would be both a natural
and reasonable one, and yet this world will
be a seriously-astonished old globe when it
comes about. It has come to regard it as a
matter of course that the over-production of
wealth should leave the class which produced
thac wealth in a state of .utter and miserable
destitution, and when the human race in the
aggregate is suffering from a too great supply
of food and clothes and furniture, and similar
articles, it seems quite a reasonable result
that half the individual members of that
race should be unable to get any of
these articles, simply because of their
abundance. It considers it as part of the
unchangeable design of a presumably sane
Providence that in every period of tem-
porary scarcity the worker—the one in-
dividual whom the world cannot spare—
should bo sacrificed, while the landlord and
the monopolist—whom the world does not
want—go on as usual, and it is utterly
unable to realise that such a scheme is more
absurd than feeding a dog on kings when
meat is in short supply. And in particular
it actually believes that poverty and want
are caused by that mysterious influence
called “ depression of trade,” which is a truly
wonderful example of the power of vigorous
and vociferous perjury to disseminate any
theory, however glaringly ridiculous. If a
partnership of three men loses £lO,OOO out
of its joint capital of £300,000, and two of
the members judiciously convert this loss
into a profit by murdering the third and
annexing his share of the property, the third
man dies through a falling-off in trade in
- exactly the same way as hundred of workers
die every year, but in such cases this slow
old sphere wakes up and creates a dust. Yet
if the hangman were provided with a dic-
tionary and a brain he would probably be
surprised to find how little difference there
is between “commercial depression” and
murder after all.
Oswald Keatinge’s Conviction: Its
Democratic Moral.
The Bulletin has no desire to shed one tear
over the man who so tragically closed a
chequered career in Darlinghurst Prison last
week under the borrowed name of Oswald
Keatinge. There is no reasonable moral
ground for doubting that he did commit the
offence of which he was found guilty ; his his-
tory is of such a character as to preclude any
regrets from the point of view of the general
community at his withdrawal from the stage of
life, and as for the wretched old man himself,
he is far better off at rest for ever than with
five years’ penal servitude to add to his already
long and varied experience of prison life. But,
while not denying that Keatinge’s sentence
was probably well-deserved—that is ip say,
well-deserved to the extent that the same may
be said of perhaps 40 per cent, of the inmates
of Australian gaols--we would point out that
had he been a well-to-do man he would not
have died in Darlinghurst. Looking at the
published reports of the case, it is pretty plain
that the only reason he was found guilty was
that he had not money enough to brief a bar-
rister. The direct evidence of the perpetration
of the offence, apart from the testimony of the
little girl concerned—a child of 12—seems to
have been practically nil. Had Keating e stood
his trial with a clean record, had there been,
as is usual in criminal trials, no evidence of
previous convictions submitted against him in
advance, had the jury, in short, seen the
prisoner only as he appeared in the dock, or as
he was known to many Sydney people—the
Reverend Doctor Oswald Keatinge, quiet,
pleasant-mannered, .cultured gentleman, it is
almost impossible that they could have con-
sidered the case so free from reasonable doubt
as to have refused him an acquittal. No charge
is easier to make, no charge requires less evi-
dence for the establishment of a primd facie
ease, than one of the kind that Keatinge had
to answer; and there is no charge more difficult
to conclusively rebut. Any man whom chance
throws for the briefest interval into the com-
pany of one of the other sex, without the
presence of witnesses,- takes the risk of an
accusation of criminal assault, and should the
accusation be made, no matter how falsely, he
is fortunate if he can produce a scrap of evi-
dence to support his bare denial. It is a
knowledge of this fact that always makes a
decent jury very cautious about bringing in a
verdict of guilty on the unsupported statement
of the prosecutrix. A prisoner is almost sure
to escape if the respectability of his appearance
raises a presumption in his favour, and the testi-
mony against him is only the statement of a child,
without corroboration on any material points,
so long as no evidence is forthcoming to counter-
balance the original favourable presumption.
In Keatinge’s ease there can be little doubt
that what ruined his chance with the jury was
the disclosure of his previous disreputable his-
tory. But for that disclosure he might have
stepped from the dock a free man. Now, that
disclosure could not have been made if Keat-
inge had been defended by a sane barrister.
* * *
In a criminal case no evidence can be given as
to the character of a prisoner unless he himself
raises the question of character. Keatinge
appears to have asked one of the Crown wit-
nesses whether the latter had not heard of him
as a man of good repute, or something of that
sort. No lawyer who knew this client’s history
could have asked that innocent-looking question
because he would have foreseen the consequences.
It was evidence of character tendered by the
prisoner, and so enabled the prosecution to get
in all they knew to his discredit, not one word
of which would otherwise have been admissible.
Had Keatinge avoided that blunder, the jury
would have gone out to consider their verdict
without a suspicion that the man they were
trying had ever stood behind the spikes before,
and the chances are a hundred to one that the
verdict would have been “ not guilty.” It may
be said that that would have been a miscarriage
of justice. Perhaps it would. The Bulletin
has no fault to find with the thing called justice
for miscarrying—the point is that if it did
happen to carry straight on this occasion it was
only because it was aimed at a man with an
empty pocket.
# # *
Now, if criminal trials are to be conducted
fairly, the law on this point must be made one
thing or the other. If previous convictions and
conduct are to be put into the scale against one
man on his trial, then let every other man in
the same position, rich or poor, well-educated
or uninstructed, be treated in the same way.
Either the character and reputation of an
accused, are elements that ought to be taken into
account by a jury in deciding on guilt or
innocence, or they are not. If they are not,
then it is a scandalous injustice that ignorance
of a petty technicality of law should expose one
man to the disadvantage of having all his past
and legally-expiated sins raked up against him.
If the average jury were composed of skilled
psychologists, there -would be something to be
said in favour of supplying them with a detailed
history of the prisoner’s previous career, and
that of his immediate and collateral relations.
Twelve scientists deputed to decide whether
a given individual was guilty of putting
another man’s name at the bottom of a
cheque might be able to determine accurately


how far the probabilities of the case were
affected by the fact that his grandmother
suffered from a certain fixed delusion. They
could, perhaps, settle the precise presumption
of guilt to be fairly deduced from his previous
conviction for assaulting a policeman. For all
we know, the presumption in that case might
be the other way. But with scratch juries
who have not made a special study of the laws
of heredity and mental development, The
Bulletin believes in the common-sense arrange-
ment of trying a person charged with an offence
on evidence relating to that offence, and nothing
else. If there be evidence enough to convict
him, let him go to gaol for a longer or shorter
terra whether he has been there before or not ;
in the absence of that evidence, why should the
Crown be allowed to make up for the want of it
by raising a prejudice against him in the minds
of the jury? Just look at the thing from this
standpoint, dear reader : put yourself in the
dock with a charge of no matter what hanging
over your head. How would you like to lay
your past life absolutely bare to the Crown
Prosecutor, and let him quote just so much as
suited him, with a clever lawyer’s twist on it,
before the 12 men—men often ignorant and
brutal and prejudiced, who had your life or
liberty in their hands ? How many men in the
whole country would dare to take the risk ?
# * *
This is the plain justice of the matter. If the
law is to endure that a pauper prisoner by ask-
ing an unguarded question may open the door
bo evidence that will undo him, it is the bounden
duty of the judge to warn him what such a
question means, and give him an opportunity of
withdrawing it. Even that shouldn’t be enough
to satisfy the sentiment of fair play in a demo-
cratic community. It should not be left to the
judge to protect the prisoner’s interests. There
should be someone expressly appointed for the
purpose. There is a Crown Prosecutor to see
that the case against the accused is put as
strongly as possible, and the State ought
at the same time to provide a lawyer
to assist the accused and see that the
jury get a fair view of his side of the case.
The function of the Government in the ad-
ministration of justice is to give every man a
fair trial ; it has no more interest in the convic-
tion of the guilty than in the acquittal of the
innocent; and if it be necessary to pro-
vide a barrister at the expense of the
country to guard against the escape
of the guilty, it is a gross injustice that
a barrister is not on hand to help to keep the
innocent out of gaol.- This principle has been
already recognised in the case of prisoners
charged with capital offences, and there is no
possible ground on which objection could be
consistently made to its extension along the
whole scale of crimes and misdemeanours.
Keatinge, as events have proved, was on trial
for his life. He was 62 years of age, and just
after being sentenced to five years’ penal servi-
tude he died in his prison-cell.
That Recreation Room.
The Industrial School at Parramatta, where
young Sydney girls who get into the hands of
the police are sent to reform, is being run on
new lines. It has occurred to somebody to put
in practice the astounding theory that girls aged
from eight up to eighteen or so might occasion-
ally feel the want of some sort of relaxation,
and that they might stand a chance of develop-
ing into civilised womanhood if this want
were to some extent supplied. Accordingly
the well-behaved inmates are now allowed to
spend their evenings in the recreation-room,
with books, a piano, draught-boards, and other
unintoxicating instruments of dissipation, with
the extraordinary result that they are actually
growing in some measure contented and well-
behaved, and have left off prospecting with a
bread-knife for the matron’s scalp.
# # *
Now, Mrs. Grundy, what are you going to
do with those girls when in the course of time
your overflowing philanthropy prompts you to
take them into service in your Christian house-
hold? You will give them half-a-sovereign a
week, perhaps, and their keep, and in return
you will ask for nothing but gratitude and the
housework. But will you give them a chance
to spend their evenings in wholesome recrea-
tion ? Will you let them ask their friends in to
play draughts, or will they have any other
opportunity, except one afternoon a fortnight,
of enjoying congenial and innocent companion-
ship? You know, or you ought to know, Mrs.
Grundy, that human nature in the industrial
school and in the drawing-room is just on the
same pattern as human nature in the kitchen;
but will you treat those girls, when they become
your servants, as so much white woman like
yourself ?
# # *
No, Mrs. Grundy, you will not. They will
get up at 6 o’clock in the morning, and light
the lire, and bring you tea, and sweep the back
yard, and polish your husband’s boots, and
cook the meals, and wash and iron and do the
rooms, and scrub the floors, and keep the house
clean, and always be tidy to attend to the door,
and wait at table, and take the children out for
a walk in the afternoon, and run errands, and
do any other little jobs that want doing; and
so long as they are hardworking and respectful
and never answer back, perhaps you will not
throw it up in their teeth that they are only
charity-girls and ought to go down on their
knees to thank you for all your kindness. But
you will not permit them to indulge in ridicu-
lous ideas about recreation, and nonsense of that
sort. You don’t believe in letting maids think
they are “as good as their mistresses.” You
know how to keep your servants “in their pro-
per place.”
* * *
Exactly so. A..a if those girls come to get
utterly sick of the everlasting sound of the
treadmill, and to shudder at the vista of life-
long servitude ahead, and to think enviously of
the gaiety and freedom of girls they know who
didn’t happen to get reformed ; if they eftne to
feel, Mrs. Grundy, that a hard-working, vir-
tuous life isn’t worth the price they pay for it,
and go out to earn their living on the streets,
their blood wiU be on your head. Uo you

PLAIN ENGLISH.
David Syme, Jingo.
The Melbourne Ace is suffering from the worst
attack of Jingoism in the head that has ever yet
descended upon that once Democratic paper. Its
latest idea is that Australia has got to raise an
army and send it along to India to assist in
rolling back the tide of Russian invasion, and
the reason of this extraordinary prospective
gyration is that should Russia conquer India
then Australia will be scattered and annexed
and broken up generally. In fact, the one hope
and opportunity of Australia is to send her
troops to whoop on the frozen peaks of Afghan-
istan, and unless they yell in the forefront of
the battle all is lost:—
Australia shares in the danger and is interested in meet-
ing it, whether from the Imperial or local point of view.
Even as an independent state Australia could not afford to
agree to an occupation of India by Russia ; in fact, our
danger would be all the greater. If the Russians reach
the sea-front the menace to Australia will be intolerable,
and Australia has its own interest in preventing this.
The defence of Australia begins on the hills outside
Herat.
There is one point here that the Age has over-
looked. If it is necessary for Australia to lend
a hand at shunting the Russians out of India —
should they arrive there —because their presence
some two or three thousand miles away would
be intolerable, why doesn’t Britain find it abso-
lutely necessary to shunt the French out of
France because their presence, some 20 miles
away from the English coast, must be a lot
more intolerable ? Why isn’t it essential that
she should bounce the Germans out of Prussia
for exactly the same cause, and give the
Spaniards notice to quit in Spain. And for the
same reason, why are not the Russians at St.
Petersburg as intolerable to England as the
Russians at Calcutta would be to Australia,
seeing that they are a great deal nearer,
and how is it that the mother country hasn’t
found it indispensable to rush them out of that
city ? Why doesn’t every nation find every
other adjacent nation an unbearable menace,
and why don’t they all find that they must
move each other further away, and if they did
make that discovery where would they move
each other to? If the defence of Australia
begins in Afghanistan it is quite obvious that
Australia must help to defend Afghanistan, but
the only way to do that would be to find out
where the defence of Afghanistan begins,
and if it starts as far away as the
Australian defences its outlying bulwarks must
either be at Moscow or Timbuctoo, and where
their defences begin no one knows. And sup-
posing there should be any mistake, and
America instead of Russia should prove to be
the coming enemy of this country, then the
defence of Australia clearly begins on the
Saskatchewan River or else in the interior of
Mexico. Further, how is it that there is nothing
conspicuously intolerable about the French in
New Caledonia, or the Germans in New Guinea,
or the Spaniards in the Carolines, as they arc
all much nearer than India, and are all strong
enough, if they chanced to boil over, to make
things hot for us ? And, lastly, where is
•Jingoism to end, for if the Russians rnvM be
driven out of Afghanistan for the safety of Aus-
tralia, then it is equally evident that they must
also be driven out of Turkestan for the safety
of Afghanistan, and out of some other place for
the safety of Turkestan, till at last we arrive at
a point where it becomes absolutely indispens-
able to drive everybody out of everywhere. In
fact, it might even be necessary to drive David
Syme out of the Age office, lest he should become
a menace to someone at the other end of the
street whose line of defence happened to begin
just in Mr. Same’s backyard.
A State Fraud.
Mr. Carruthers, the Nerv South Wales Minis-
ter for Public Instruction, personally bears the
reputation of a chivalrous man who would
neither devour widows’ houses nor cuckoo the
nests of orphans. But he is the head of a
department which systematically robs children
of their inheritance and females of their dues.
We are thinking of the case of the late Mrs.
Lockett, an old and faithful servant of
the State, and a highly-educated, refined, and
brainy woman. Mrs. Lockett was consecu-
tively schoolmistress in the State schools at
Forest Lodge, Camperdown, Newtown, Parra-
matta, William-street (Sydney), Hamilton, and
Scone. Her departmental record was of the
best, and she was known to the literary world
as a thoughtful contributor to the Nineteenth
Century and other English magazines. Her hus-
band seems to have been a bad lot —he deserted
her and committed bigamy, for which he received
a sentence of imprisonment in a neighbouring
province—and she was saddled with the onerous
task of bringing up her family by her own un-
aided efforts, a duty which she bravely and
conscientiously fulfilled. For years she had
contributed to the superanuation fund in her
department, and, shortly before her death, she
purposed resigning and proceeding to England,
where literary inducements had been held out
to her. While she was making the necessary
arrangements for resigning she died. Had she
been able to write out her resignation she
would have become entitled, out of the Superan-
nuation Fund, to a fair sum of money, which
she could have bequeathed to her children. But
she did not formally resign, and so the depart-
ment absorbed in itself the insurance fund that
she had for years paid out of her salary, and
refused to hand anything over to the
orphans, or for their benefit. A heartless
swindle of this sort by a private trustee
would meet with summary - punishment
at the hands of any Supreme Court judge
and jury, but it appears that the State may
be a licensed cheat and privileged marauder.
The heinousness of the fraud will be better
understood when it is remembered that all State
school teachers are compelled to pay a percentage
of their earnings into the Superannuation Fund;
in fact, the Department simply docks it out of
their salaries, without a “ By your leave.” If
a female teacher marries before a certain age,
the State robs her of her enforced past pay-
ments ; if she dies, the State usurps the birth-
right of her children. We ask Mr. < 'arruthers
how he likes this aspect of his official position
as cruel foster-parent of State babes and
sucklings and fraudulent trustee to honest
women ?

The “ Limits of Existence.”
A great, wild, vociferous Tory named Pincott
writes an article in the National Magazine,
in the course of which ho casts various new
lights upon the questions of labour and wages,
and draws attention to sundry facts about the
poor which no other commentator seems to
have noticed. The following observation is one
which only a man of “ the classes ” could have
written, and it deserves to be printed large on
its author’s tomb, and howled in his ear by a
bull-voiced ghoul through all the ages of
eternity ;
Whether pay be increased or the hours of labour
diminished the ultimate result will be the same, for the
poor will always, 6 y choice, live on the limits of existence.
Unless the British language has been mislaid,
this statement can only have one meaning—
that the poor are poor simply because they have
a unanimous desire to be poor, and that they
are violently opposed to any one who attempts
to encumber them with riches. Consequently
Mr. Pincott and all the rest of the tribe of
capitalists are doing them a noble service when
they totter along beneath the load of the big
bank-accounts which the masses shrink from
with horror, and drink the champagne and eat
the turkey which the toilers loathe and abomin <
ate ; and they are perpetrating an act of magni-
ficent self-sacrifice when they do no work,
because the British labourer wants all the work
himself, and the only thing he blasphemes at is
the pay. He lives on the “ limits of subsist-
ence ” by choice , and, as he chooses to live there,
it necessarily follows that he objects to any-
thing that threatens to alter his condition.
Therefore, the dockers’ strike and the great
railway convulsion and other troubles of the
same order were really attempts on the part of
the workman to get his wages lowered and
made more precarious—in fact, they were so
many efforts to get as near as possible to the
aforesaid “ limits ” that he is so fond of ; and
the difficulties in the coal-trade are an expres-
sion of the miner’s frenzied resolve to keep his
screw down or perish in the conflict. And in
like manner crime assumes anew aspect, and
burglary is a scheme by which the burglar
bursts open a house and feloniously deposits
property in it, because if he took property out
instead he would be manifesting a desire which
doesn’t exist to get away from the “ limits of ex-
istence and embezzlement is evidently a dodge
by which the underpaid clerk puts his own miser-
able salary in his employer’s cash-box ; and
garroting, we presume, is an evil-minded plan
by which a man chokes himself in the street,
and then forcibly presents his watch and his
loose cash to the unprotected passer-by. And
as to fraudulent insolvency complicated by
arson it must be in reality a method by which a
trader burns down his own premises, and after-
wards declines to accept the insurance, in order
to disguise the fact that he had bought all his
goods honestly, and paid for them twice over,
and then given them away to the poor, for if
man actually wants to live on the “limits of
existence” it is evident that he would run con-
siderable risks in the effort to get there, and
would make a serious row if anybody tried to
hinder him. And if these things are not so,
the only possible alternative is that the
Tory litterateur is either a drivelling hypo-
crite, or an incurable lunatic, or possibly
the two combined, and as for the editor who
publishes his maunderings the only expressions
which could adequately describe his mental
condition are of a kind that are utterly unfit
for publication.
The Bloated Dock-Labourer.
Leading Australian liars in a good way of busi-
ness will doubtless be interested in the following
statement which is going the rounds of the
press;—
Some of the dockers have been striking again in Lon-
don, and the statements have revealed a condition of
demoralisation among the men which is shocking and
alarming, skilled men refusing to work at 12s. 6d. a day,
and unskilled men demanding Is. 6d. to 2s. 6d. an hour,
and even at high wages taking thirteen days to unload a
ship which would have been emptied in three days at
Liverpool or New York.
It is a pity that the clumsy perjurer who invented
this statement forgot to mention that each one
of the starving, ragged, shoeless wretches who
are clamouring by hundreds for work in the
docks also insist on being made a duke and
having a landed estate thrown in. Also, he
overlooked the circumstance that the dockers
insist on working in evening dress, and that
many of them are on strike because the com-
panies refused this concession, and demanded
that they should wear frock coats and light
pants ; and he failed to allude to the fact that
most of them have been appointed Archbishop
of Canterbury, and that they have since struck
because they want to be John L. Sullivan at
the same time. Any intelligent and reliable
Ananias would have thrown in these statements
to lend an air of probability to his stupendous
lie, and he would hlso have explained
how his assertion squared with the well-known
fact that the dock-companies can get ten
times as many men as they want at sixpence an
hour, and that this miserable stipend is practi-
cally the sum total of the dockers’ ambition.
At the present moment, however, another huge
strike is in the air, for the companies are re-
solved to crush unionism, and take back the
miserable concession of one penny an hour which
they granted some time ago ; and the atrocious
perjury which we ! have quoted is one of the
preliminary moves to prevent their victims re-
ceiving any public sympathy or support. It is
true that the employers have nothing to gain
by reverting to the old order of things ; the
trifling improvement in the condition of the
men has produced such good results that no
amount of hard and violent lying could disguise
the fact that profits have increased and expenses
actually diminished under the new regime ; but
pride and mortification all demand that the men
should be “ put down ” —that capital should
“resent unwarrantable dictation”—and that
the great principle of “ freedom of contract ”
should be maintained in its entirety. There-
fore the great fight will, in all probability, have
to be fought over again, and as a preliminary
step an idiotic Tory press circulates the story
that the bloated labouring autocrat wants some-
thing like 255, a day, just as the same English
authority attempted to represent the Australian
strikers as demanding £4 or £5 a week, and as
the new season’s crop of lunatics is just in the
one statement will probably be credited in the
present, just as the other was in the past.

Catskin Trimmings.
The aldermanic flunkeys of Bendigo have just
carried out a sort of Lord Mayor’s Show of
their own. It was a piece of religious flummery
which preserved the worst features of British
beadledom. In England, an ancient custom
was for municipal authorities to “process” in
liveries on certain Sundays to the parish church
in order to demonstrate their continued loyalty
to “the Church by Law established.” But,
with the removal of religious tests, these useless
pageants have fallen into disuse even in
England. Here in Australia there is no State
Church, and civic dignities are open equally to
the adherents of all religious or the professors
of no religion at all. Yet the Bendigo aider-
men, on Sunday week, made a circus-parade to
the local Anglican church—the Mayor happen-
ing to be an Episcopalian. Had he been a J ew,
we suppose the aldermen would have tranquilly
trotted behind him to a synagogue on a Satur-
day. Had he been a Salvationist, they would
have rolled the old chariot along with knee-
drill, by drum and tambourine accompaniment,
Had he been an aggressive atheist, they would
have imported Jos, Symes and sung “ The
Celibate Parson and the Nut-brown Maid ”
as their opening anthem. These specu-
lations are not all far-fetched, in view
of what they really did do. First
walked Church of England parsons, in
their “ gowns next, the Mayor, in cocked
hat and official robes; Aldermen, in plug-lug
costumes ; Town Clerk, official ; City Solicitor,
summer clothes, belltopper and smile; Rate
Collector, ditto ; Cattle-market Inspector,
mufti; messenger, a youth in buttons. The
congregation mocked it at the church-door
with—“ Onward, Christian soldiers!” And
why all this '{ Because a more or less vulgar
Mayor wanted to show himself publicly in a
cocked hat and certain absurd robes trimmed
with catskin. We are glad to notice in Aus-
tralia generally an increasing disposition to
jeer at “robes” and “orders” ami loud uni-
forms, and wigs and ermine, and artillery
salutes, and all trash of . the kind, The more
“gorgeous” the robes and the greater the
pomp—so it is written in the history of the world
—the bigger the sham,
That the Builders and Contractors should hold
aloof from the aggressive Employers’ Union will
hardly surprise any person who has had any
dealings with these gentlemen. In no other
trade do such friendly feelings exist between
employer and employed, and a tone of perfect
equality prevails, from the hod-carrier, to the
boss himself. In fact, it is not unusual for the
men to address the master by his Christian
name. The reason is not hard to discover : the
successful builder is a practical tradesman, and
must have undergone long pupilage at real
“hard graft;” lie therefore is fully aware of
the difficulties under which wages are earned,
and can sympathise with the man who considers
his remuneration inadequate. Unfortunately,
the prices obtainable do not permit of high
wage-giving, as the sweaters of the building-
trade are the architects and proprietors. It is
impossible for anyone of the masher species to
succeed at contracting; it is the one line of
business in which mere theory is useless,
Accordingly, where no class prejudices exas-
perate the workers at every turn, and where
respect is offered and given on all sides, and
where half of the employed have prospects of
ultimately becoming employers themselves, the
seething hostilities which characterise other
trades are conspicuous by their absence.
Judge Moleswokth, charging a Melbournt
jury in the Stella Marks murder case, took a
queer view of the “ temporary insanity ” ques-
tion. “If the prisoner had sufficient reason to
know he was doing an act that was wrong, he
is responsible for his crime. If he had not
sufficient reason to know he was doing an act
that was wrong he is entitled to be acquitted on
the ground of insanity,” said His Honor. This
Cockney definition of madness in its bearing
upon murder is so uncommonly narrow that
probably no murder has ever come within it.
Undoubted lunatics, after committing a murder,
have shown the greatest cunning in endeavour-
ing to divert suspicion from themselves. The
common or garden kind of insanity is supposed
to be that condition of mind which incites a
person to do something senseless, foolish, rash,
or wrong, whilst rendering the said person in-
capable of resisting any strong impulse. One
would like to have Coroner Youl’s opinion on
the Moleswokth doctrine. The man who
writes, “I am going to end my troubles. God
forgive me !” and then jumps into the Yarra, is
evidently aware that he is doing something
which the Church and State call wicked. But
a coroner—usually the best of public authori-
ties on temporary insanity—advises his jury
that “ deceased committed suicide by drowning,
whilst of unsound mind.” And the world says
“ hear, hear.” This doesn’t prove that the
slayer of giddy Miss Marks was mad when
•overcome by his jealous impulse, but it seems
to negative the proposition that a man must
necessarily bo sane when doing something
which he knows to be an offence against the
law, or even against his God. It is worth
noticing, too, that the Moleswokth doctrine,
if accepted, would dispose of kleptomania in
one act, seeing that sufferers from this strange
complaint always recognise their own responsi-
bility by secreting stolen goods underneath
their waistcoats or inside their bustles.
The Age, in summing up Charles Bradlaugh
says that it “utterly abhors the vulgarity of
mind and education which have induced such
men to shock persons of gentler t} pc by coarsely
ridiculing matters of creed.” This is rather
good when you think it out hard. These per-
sons “ of gentler type ’’—the social upper-crust
f or the time being—have shocked each other a

boiled and fried and flayed and choked and shot
and disembowelled each other, and squashed
each other’s heads with ingenious iron instru-
ments, and they are knocking each other about
just now in Ireland, and cursing each other in
New South Wales in the interests of Foreign-
trade, and damaging each other in Russia, and
in Wales the police and the soldiers are kepi
busy because one creed persists in “ shocking ”
another creed with taxes and confiscation. They
ought to have got over the worst part of the
shock by this time, and for the rest of it, if
they have not been “ coarsely ridiculing” each
other for 1900 years, then the English language
is a weak, inadequate affair, and utterly void of
expression. And the persons of “gentler type,”
from JoShua down to John Hawses, seem to
have been about as gentle as a shark, and their
finer feelings have been akin to those of the
mail-clad rhinoceros. It is rough that Brad-
laugh should have trodden on their sensi-
bilities.
* * #
We remember the time, a few years ago,
when “ persons of gentler type ” did “ utterly
abhor ” the Age on account of the fearless, not
to say reckless, manner in which that paper
“ridiculed matters of creed,” shattered the
idols of sectarianism, and “ shocked ” the sen-
sibilities of public men who could not afford to
have their private life unveiled to the guffawing
gaze of the intensely-interested public. It is a
curious coincidence that in those days, of which
the Age now visibly repents, that newspaper
had a mighty and vital influence over the people
of Victoria. The Age was not wont to sack
caramels and mumble with a lisp in those lurid
Berry times when it chronicled paians of jubi-
lant prophecy about ‘ 1 broken heads and flaming
houses,” petted “ Berry, the buster-up,” eulo-
gised Woods, the Wat-Tyler of the time,
haloed Lalor, the past-rebel, and pitchforked
into political life O’Loghlen, the first man to
publicly suggest “ cutting the painter,” &c., &c,
But David Bvme has changed all that. He has
grown wealthy on the pence of the million, and
his riches have begotten new sensibilities “ of
gentler type.” With its new-born reverence
for credal fetishes the Age thus become
“respectable,” and has consequently lost all
but its purely commercial influence with the
masses. Its ‘ 1 vulgarity of mind and educa-
tion ” are carefully covered with the fig-leaves
of conscious hypocrisy,
In one of the Sydney Police Courts lately , '*
man named Livermore was charged before
Stipendiary Abbott (now on sick-leave) with
indecent exposure. The S.M. said he regretted
much that he was unable to order a Hogging, as
he happened to be sitting alone, but, added he
significantly, “I will send you for trial where
you will be liable to 14 years’ penal servitude.”
At the trial in the superior court the jury,
after being locked up all night, disagreed, and
w'ere discharged. The Attorney-General has
since—and this is where the satire on Mr.
Stipendiary Abbott and tire brutal code of laws
which he and his brethren dispense comes in—
refused to go any further with the case, and
Livermore has been set at liberty ! Thus the
crime which Mr. Abbott was so sure had been
committed, and over which he bewailed his
inability to summarily order a flogging, has, in
the opinion of a jury, not been proved ; nor in
the deliberate and dispassionate opinion of
Attorney-General Simpson (who, considering
that he had the murderess, Louisa Collins,
tried three times and eventually convicted, can-
not be accused of chicken-heartedness in such
matters) is there evidence before the Crown to
justify the man being tried again ? So much
for hasty floggings at the mere behest of a
couple of beaks. If you give a pair of mere
magistrates power to flog a man, why not give
them power to hang him?
A duty cast on every man by law is mat of
supporting his wife and family. To neglect
this duty is an offence for which a man may be,
and occasionally is, sent to gaol. He may also
be, and frequently is, sent to gaol for other
offences. Certain it is that whatever he goes
therefor, so long as he is there he can’t support
his innocent family, and unless they can find
some other means of subsistence they must
starve. Will someone please show some valid
reason why the Government—the administrator
of the law, the power that has taken away their
breadwinner—should not support them till it
gives him a chance of doing so himself?
Why should it not undertake the duty the law
says he must discharge, but which it prevents
him from discharging ? A citizen is temporarily
withdrawn from circulation because his fellow’-
citizeus in their collective capacity think that
course is conducive to their welfare, and there-
upon a number of perfectly innocent people are
driven to look for bread in the poorhouse and on
the streets. What has an enlightened demo-
cratic humanity to say to this? “For God’s
sake consider my poor wife and children!”
groans the convicted man in the dock. ‘‘l am
sony for them,” returns the judge, “but it is
you who should have considered them.” When
woman gets a vote will she be more just than
man has been to the wives and children of men
sent to gaol in the public interest?

810 Maoquafie-street North, Sydney, March 4, 1891.
My dear Moorabinda,—
A dense crowd without the pale and a chosen few
inside on the platform were the only outward and visible
signs at Redfern on 25th ultimo that heralded the approach
of Lady Jersey. Not a twig was put up to decorate the ugly
station, nor was a yard of the good old crimson drugget
to be seen, and if it hadn’t been for the 180 Fort-street
children in white frocks and blue sashes, all carrying
flowers which they scattered before the Countess, the
arrival would have been a woefully colourless one.
Mayor Burdekin, in a festive w r hite carnation button-
holder, brought Miss Burdekin in figured blue cambric
with dark-blue velvet trimmings; and another well-
known gentleman had his wife with him, but otherwise the
committee of welcome—including the inevitable Dan, Mr,
E, T. Cracknel!, Mr. Unmaok (Postmaster-General of
Queensland), who is here for the conference, and
Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonald (Brisbane) —wore a singu-
larly “ smoke-night ” air. After leaving the train Lady
Jersey was presented by Miss Lily Bridges w ith a well-
put-up bouquet of amaryllis, tiger lilies, and crimson-and-
saffron roses tied with the Jersey colours of blue
and yellow; the “little Jerseys” also received
bouquets, all of which Were laid on by Minister
Carruthers. Of course, an infant murmured a verbal
(for this relief much thanks) address of the usual type,
and in her reply Lady Jersey showed that even if her
voice is more pipey than resonant, she has mastered the
beautiful art of cutting it short.
The new social beacon has popularity written all over
her. She is a medium-sized woman with a kind, clever
face beautifully devoid of cosmetics, dark-brown hair
simply drawn up in a knot on the top of her head, snow-
white teeth and brown eyes. She looks thirty-three or
four, though in reality she is among the forties, and her
figure is slim and erect. She wore, on arriving, a copper*
coloured silk gown covered with black-spotted net and
la«e, with panels on kite right side of copper-coloured rep
ribbon with loops of the ribbon across fastened with a
rosette, a black jet belt round- the waist, and a black jet
collar fastened with a diamond star brooch ; small black
lace and jet bonnet with black strings and cluster of
honeysuckle on the crown, copper-silk parasol veiled in
black chiffon, a black tulle half veil, tern kid gloves and
gold chain bangle- Her daughters wore workmanlike
frocks of cream serge made with straight skirts feather-
stitched round the hem with white silk and long double-
breasted jackets with Capuchin hoods, sailor hats, with a
band of white ribbon and cream gossariier veils. They
are two pale fair girls wearing their hair flowing and
brushed bock from their foreheads-.
Unlike Lady Carington, the Countess of Jersey doesn’t
wear a bang but combs her hair off like hubby does, and
so the frizzly-poodle female whose eyebrows no human
being ever sees will be hopelessly left. What a revelation
there will be if fringes become bad form in Sydney and
the Jersey poll catches on ! For one’s forehead seems to
gather to itself all the depressing wrinkles in one’s
system, and the belle who looks 19 with her hair curled
round her temples turns out a bald 40when she wears her
cranial locks Ala cock’s-comb. Yet still there is balm' in
Gilead for those women who suffer from high foreheads
and must cover them to keep them from looking like a.
death’s head on a toasting fork. Whatever may be the
anti-fringe fad in Sydney, the Princess of Wales, the-
“ great I am” of what is correct to Wear, still clings to-
iler curly front.
There must be some mystic vice-regal meaning in blue
neckties. Gov. Jersey has taken to wearing one which
leaves Carington’s a faded failure, and as it doesn’t har-
monise with the rich tints of his back hair why does he
wear it ? Perhaps as a sort of polite blue ribbon to show
that “ it ” really is caused by indigestion.
A good idea for women whose hair is demoralised by the
damp night air, and who don’t wish to go forth to even-
ing shivoos wrapped up to their eyes like mummies, is to-
fix a tulle or net fall—pale-pink is the least noticeable and
most becoming shade—over the face and hair ere putting
on the “fascinator.” This keeps the pericranial curls in
decent condition until you “get there’’—besides which
the—er —powder doesn’t blow off before the fun begins.
There is much argument as to the form of local reception
to be given to Lady Jersey, who is to visit the City of
Asylums on 19th inst. Some of the aldermen are for an
extended garden-party, others for a reception with re-
freshment, but so far nothing definitely has been arranged'
barring the date.
There is a skewbald time ahead for those foolish virgins;
and others who bleached their non-committal tresses a
light tan-colour and then, having coquetted with peroxide-
of hydrogen, came forth silkworra-hued, since yellow
frizzes are quite out of fashion and blue-black hair is the-
only wear. What this will lead to is easily prophesied.
In my mind's eye, Horatio, I can see the streaky coils;
where the gold-wash still gleams through the stove-polish
and the peroxide and the black lead refuse to amalgamate..
The colour at first would be a rusty tint like a black-
poodle in need of a bath, but probably if the patient
perseveres and lays it on thick and doesn’t mind her hair
coming out in fistfuls she may eventually turn out bakl-
headed or raven-hued—that is it she doesn’t go mad in
the intcriyi from dye on the brain. No naturally fair-
haired woman will take any notice of the brunette craze
or dip her waving “glory” in the inkstand. For dark
hair will never enjoy more than a brief run; that it does
not light up well under the electric light being the great
reason.
One of woman’s weirdest features is the style in which
she invariably glares down the other party, even though
t he hapless wight (who is generally a man) is the only one
really justified in showing tantrums. If you ride in any
public vehicle at the hour when weary masculinity is
being bumped or rattled home to its evening meal, en-
wrapped (the man, not the meal) in the damp sheets of
of the noozepaper, you can’t but be struck by the number
of conscienceless women who devour his columns with a
palpable side-eye; and when some Brute, churlishly
objecting to share his penn’orth with an utter stranger,
pointedly folds his paper up so that he alone can have the
benefit of it, the withering and indignant glare of his
oppressor is hot enough to shrivel up a regiment'.
It really seems as if the average she can’t keep her eyes
off itinerant literature. To produce and read a letter
(especially if it is in a mannish fist) in the presence of
women is equal to waving a red rag at a bull. Should
you by chance look up from the thrilling page, you will
see half the women with their eyes on their cheeks to find
out what it is all about, while those out of range have you
fixed with a merciless stare as if they would read your
soul from the trimming on your hat. A spirit of rivalry,
too, is often engendered in the feminine bosom at the
appearance of an envelope. Somebody once told me that
she began to read a letter in an omnibus half-full of
darlings with their hands in their laps. In the twinkling
of a tack each woman got a crumpled-up sheet out of her
pocket and became breathlessly absorbed in its well-worn
contents.
The awesome naivetd of some women is a fearful and
wonderful thing. I was on the railway recently, with a
mixed company on board, and behind me sat two little
dears, whose free and gladsome cackle was audible all
over the train. Said one: “ And so Frank and I went
and had dinner, but I didn’t eat anything.” “Win - ,
weren’t you hungry?” queried her companion. “Dread-
fully, simply starving, but I just wouldn’t let Frank see
me eat. Didn’t I have a good meal when I got home
though.”
Somebody recently waved a frantic pen on the
puzzling subject of Woman's Dress—it was only too
obviously a he—while determining that the broad lines of
female dress were shaped by the “masculine element,”
said darkly “ The small modifications made by women in
the fashion prescribed for them arise solely,” &c., &c.
But “modification ” is an ill-fitting term to aim at Women
and clothes, seeing that exaggeration is the prevailing-
feminine weakness. For instance, crinolettes, bashfully
introduced by Worth, led to balloon-like crinolines ; from
the diminutive bag of cotton wadding was evolved the
gigantic improver which flourished like a green bay-tree
for more than one season. Everybody remembers how,
when high hats came in, women never rested till they
worked them up to pyramids, and to-day the fashionable
frockist is often told to cut the gored skirt a little scanter
than the rest, and to ridge the gigot sleeves quite up to
the car. In fact, women who “dress” never “modify”
if they can possibly help it. They leave all that to the
twenty-four-inch-waisted hygienic creature who is always
Careful to look and see if her new hat has ventilation-
holes.
Apropos to gored skirts, tile girl of the period is begin-
ning to enter more deeply into her brother’s feelings
when she sees the knees of his continuations drooping
baggily, for the gored skirt does precisely the same
thing. There was a singularly tight one oil the Block the
other day with two distinct bags where the wearer's knees
fitted in when she walked, and the effect was very funny.
If gored skirts remain in much longer a stretcher will
have to be included in one’s dressing-ease.
Poor but popular young men who mourn the nap as
it flies from the brims of their hats through repeated
salutations to the sex will be glad to know that the latest
Paris way of acknowledging a woman is to raise the hand
to the forehead in the military manner, or else “ to press
the palm against the heart, gently stooping meanwhile,’
This last recipe must look a good deal like cramps until
you get used to it, hut it will give men’s hat-brims a
chance.
In Bland Holt's thrill, “ Master and Man,” at Sydney
Royal, as the action oscillates between a ’umble ’ome and
a boiler-factory the tear-soaked heroine (Kate Bishop) is
necessarily persecuted in mufti, and the sprightly foil
(Mrs. Bland Holt) wears her dimpled elbows ready for
action most of the time. Kate Bishop has a well-cut
sage-green dress and flat leghorn hat trimmed with blow
aways in the first act, and pretty Mrs. Bland Holt is
Dresden Chinaish in a cream skirt with a long-tailed top
flowered in crimson pompadour, but the rest of the Rock-
ing is outer darkness. “ Master and Man ”is beautifully
staged, from the waving corn of the first act to the lurid
realism of the “ works,” and every woman in the audience
heaves a sigh of content when the cradle, in the second
act, delivers up a real live baby instead of the painfully
wooden monstrosity which usually hangs over the
heroine’s shoulder like a miniature Aunt Sally. There
was a full circle on the first night.
“ Arrah-na-Pogue,” at Her Majesty’s, is a tearful
theme, ending up happily on the roof, and in it Edith
Blande wears her own hair and a beautiful old-time dinner
dress of green brocade bodice and train, edged with gold
galon, the jupe and front of gold tissue, satin, and sage
green passementerie; the sleeves of gold tissue showing
the arm. Sweeney—l just love Sweeney’s Colonel
O’Grady—is nice enough to paint in a scarlet coat, a
white wig and winning little beauty-spots round his rose-
bud mouth; and Greenaway, in a periwinkle-shaped
beaver, shins up the ladder leading to the garret in a way
that only wants a hod to make it p<t i feet. The scenery
all through is beautiful, especially the moonlight in the
last act, and the cheers which greeted the appearance of
the geegee in the jaunting-car will probably induce that
stage-stricken animal to essay Hamlet on his hind legs.
The story goes that a certain NCS.W. Minister doesn’t
go through his office work quite so carefully as did his
predecessor, and in consequence of this rather an awkward
mistake happened recently. It seems that when an M.P.
goes below or above, as the case may be, the matter is at
once officially reported to the Ministers (though I’m sure
I don’t know why they should be informed since they
aren’t “in the undertaking,”)and accordingly when a
member died a little while ago they sent our hero up a
communication to that effect. But it came back in a twink-
ling with the Minister’s ear-mark “Approved” scrawled
across it. Which reminds one of that old story about the
N.S.W. Supreme Court clerk, who was notorious for sign,
ing almost anything put before him, and whom some
sportive subordinates once induced to put his name to
his own death-warrant.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Before leaving for England and the Continent, Mrs.
Sydney Burdekin will hold a farewell reception, so as to
get over the “sweet sorrow” of parting in the bulk.
A very dressy wedding was that of Miss Alize Fitz-
maurice, daughter of Mr. G. R. Fitzmaurice, “ Verncr,’'
Croydon, Sydney, to Mr. Hugh Dixon, of “ Abergeldie,”
Summer Hill, on 25th ult., at St. James’, Croydon, which
was a bower of white blossoms. The bride wore a white
gown of faille Framjaise over a jupe of brocaded satin
designed in lilies of the valley, the front of the bodice of
crepe de chine with a sash of crepe de chine on the left
side, high sleeves and Medici collar of brocade, wreath of
orange-blossoms and heather, and exquisite white bou-
quet ; her four bridesmaids (Miss Fitzmaurice, Miss Dixon,
Miss Helen Dixon and Miss Kelynack) wearing ivory
canvas cloth striped with silk, with puffed sleeves relieved
with deep frills of heliotrope ribbons from the left
shoulder; coarse straw hats trimmed with mauve and
white chiffon ; white parasols with heliotrope bows and
bouquets tied to the handles. Breakfast was held at
“Abergeldie,” after which Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Dixon left
for their honeymoon in Melbourne, the bride wearing
green cashmere with braces and cuffs of favourite passe-
menterie, black lace hat with crown of pleated dark-green
velvet and black feathers.
Mrs. Alick Osborne, of Moss Vale, who has just returned
from the Continent, intends to have the floors of her resi-
dence taken up and Swiss tiles substituted. Swiss tiles
are the latest craze “ at home.”
Lady Jersey’s first public reception was held too late
for notice this week. The world is curious to know the
fate awaiting the wife of a certain official at the hands of
Lady J.
On 26th ult. the delegates to the Postal conference
dined at Government House with Lord Jerscj'. In the
afternoon Lord and Lady Jersey with their two daughters
visited the Children’s Hospital, Glebe Point.
Lady Bertie and her sister, Miss Nellie Cox, were, we
read, present at the Stamford Dorcas ball. Lady Bertie
wore cream duchesse satin trimmed with cream and gilt
brocaded satin. Miss Nellie Cox, who will shortly marry
Captain Trench, wore creme broche satin and chiffon.
Miss Maud Emanuel, daughter of Mr. S. Emanuel, of
Elizabeth Bay, and Mr. Montagu Williams, son of the
late Captain Montagu Williams, of Seccombe House,
Cheshire, England, and “Seaborne” Place, Dundalk,
Ireland ; and Miss Ida Lewis, daughter of Mr. Neil Lewis,
of Hobart (Tas.), and Captain Eastman, of the Orlando,
are the two latest engagements.
The dance given by Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Isaacs (of St-
Elmo) on 24th inst., at Needs’ rooms, was greatly enjoyed-
Some of the toilettes were very pretty. Mrs. Isaacs
received her guests in a handsome robe of black lace and
jet; Mrs. Harry Levy wore maize-coloured silk bodice
and train over a pale-blue jupe bordered with gold bul-
lion ; Mrs. (Dr.) Cohen, in a trained gown of white
brocade; Miss Maude Cohen, Greek dress of amethvst
silk.
Mr. Sam Gray, for many years on Sydney E. News
reporting staff, and latterly its leader, has been appointed
to a position in the N.S.VV. Department of Agriculture.
He was banqueted and testimonialised by his confreres
ere quitting the office.
At the Federation banquet, Lady Parkes was partitioned
off from Lady Jersey on one side, and Mayoress Burdekin
was partitioned off from the Countess on the other. Lady
P. came in attended by some young ladies of her own set,
and, although bouquets W'ere provided for the party, no
public fuss was made. Lady J. and Mayoress B. came in
together like two friends, and were subjected to a pro-
cession and a formal presentation of bouquets.
Mr. J. Randall Mann, of Melbourne, sends
us some capital instantaneous photographs of the
start for the Newmarket Handicap.
Mr. Geoffrey Eagar’s retirement from the
N.S.W. Under-Secretaryship of Finance and
Trade has not occasioned universal regret in the
departments over which he was for so long the
practical autocrat. In the Treasury it has been
hailed with relief. A similar feeling pervades
the Custom House and the Government Printing-
Office. When Tom Richards was chief of the
latter department there was continual friction
between the two men. This originated when Mr.
Eagar was Colonial Treasurer. One of Eagar’s
pet projects was to break up the Government
Printing Office on the alleged ground that the
work could be done more cheaply and efficiently
by private printing-firms, and it is said to have
been in anticipation of this that one of the largest
Sydney printing-firms imported its plant. Sir
Henry Parkes (then plain Mister) defeated the
project in the Cabinet of which Sir James Martin
(also then plain Mister) was Premier. While
Treasurer, Eagar also came into collision with the
late W. A. .Duncan. As Treasurer, Eagar was
Duncan’s official superior. The Collector of Cus-
toms, an unbending Scotchman, declined to per-
form a certain action which the Treasurer forced
upon him, and in doing so used a certain inde-
pendence of language which Eagar and Martin
(over whom the former seemed to have an utterly
unaccountable influence) construed into insubor-
dination. In spite of the pleadings of Parkes, the
Colonial Secretary, the Cabinet dismissed Duncan
and an officer upon whom Eagar had always
looked with favour was appointed in his place.
Governor Young protested, and delayed his assent
so long as possible, but the tenacious Martin ulti-
mately carried the day. The victory cost him and
the Cabinet dearly. Parkes promptly resigned,
the Ministry was defeated, and Sir John Robert-
son returned to office. Duncan met Robertson in
the street. “ Don’t say a single word now,” said
the Watson’s Bay veteran, “we’ll have you back
before you can say Jack Robertson ! ” And with
this very fair witticism he passed on to the Cabinet
meeting which re-instated Duncan ten minutes
after it met. This catastrophe to the Martin
Government dismissed Eagar from public life, but
the back door of the Treasury was open and
through this the wily ex-Minister came as a
subordinate, exercising his peculiar influence over
successive Treasurers, even “Billy” M‘Millan
falling under his subtle sway. With Eagar as
Under-Secretary and Duncan as Collector, and
the memory of their now historic quarrel abiding
with them, the relations of the two departments
were, to say the least, strained, until ’death re-
moved Duncan. It was characteristic of Eagar
that he had a long and vindictive official memory,
and when the almost unlimited departmental in-
fluence possessed by him over the three Treasury
departments is remembered it can easily be under-
stood what that meant. Mr. Eagar is a native-
born Australian, and was once popularly known
as “Betsy.”
When lovely woman picks a biscuit,
Or sips a tiny sip of tea,
Her “ Oussie, dear,” is safe to risk it,
And ring up beef and cabbngee ;
She’s hungry for a slice of mutton,
Although she dallies o’er a sweet,
So gently smile and press the button,
And order up a feed of meat.

Bland Holt opened his Sydney Royal sea-
son with “ Master and Man ” to a tremendous
house and a warm reception from all hands. This
play seems to have started out with a desire to
achieve originality ; but, somehow, except in one
or two situations, its leaves have been gathered
beneath the spreading chestnuts whence they
fluttered down, sere and yellow, many autumns
ago. Most of its comedy, too, belongs to the
bygone bladder school that we fondly dreamed
was relegated to the limbo of the nigger farce and
the harlequinade. The acting is all right—Arthur
Lawrence can’t have much room left for marma-
lade on his little platter, for the press everywhere
has eulogised his Humpy Logan, but we must,
at the risk of a surfeit, make him swallow our
spoonful. His Humpy Logan is a closely-studied,
intelligently-handled delineation of the villain,
known only to the stage, who never relaxes his
efforts to humiliate and ruin the woman he loves
because she loves someone else. After his force-
ful acting in the furnace scene, the actor’s best
point was made in the first act when he strongly
emphasised the lines in which Humpy’s better
man shows itself ; lines made necessary by his
sudden change of front in the last act. In Tom
Honeywood, Bland Holt is fitted with one of
these perky, smart characters he handles so easily
and has the house with him all the time. ’Gus
Glover is powerful, but his dialect is not always
correct; his denunciations have the true ring,
but he pitches his lines just a little too
much to the gallery; his stuff doesn’t want
that, and would get there without. Walter
Howe is very annoying in the first act where
he walks about with an aint-I-pretty look,
but prison garb quenches his jauntiness and he is
latterly less offensive. Albert Norman as Carlton,
the polished scoundrel, looks the part and speaks
his lines well, and the St. Jones of H. R. Roberts
would be tolerable if the buffoonery were weeded
out, and if some of his business had been less pal-
pably pitch-forked into the show. Kate Bishop
and her baby deserve favourable mention ; Mrs.
Holt is charming and vivacious; May Vivian and
Flora Anstead are equal to their small oppor-
tunities, but Beelzebub was the hero of the even-
ing. George Gordon deservedly took a big call
for his foundry-scene, indeed the scenery through*
out is very fine.

At Sydney Garrick “II Trovatore ” ran
for three nights to good business. Its most
remarkable feature was the sweet vocalisation
and bright acting of Nina Osborne in Inez, a very
small part. Now “ The Bohemian Girl ” fills the
bill fully. Viewed after a lapse of time, the story
seems incoherent and not particularly interesting.
One would also like to know how it is that
while Arline grows up from babyhood to a
marriageable age none of the other people, bar
the Count, add a wrinkle or turn a hair.
Annis Montague, now in very good voice,
sings the music charmingly, and cavorts round
as giddily as adipose tissue will allow.
Charles Turner has a lovely cold, a relation of
Warwick Gainor’s, and he palpably saves himself
nightly for “The Fair Land of Poland,” which
got a triple encore on the night of our visit.
Gainor is so hoarse that it is wonderful how he
drags through. Cicely Staunton’s Gipsy Queen
is the best-acted part in the cast, and the Devils-
hoof of Fred. England is much better than we
anticipated. “Mignon,” by Arabroise Thomas,
goes up on Saturday night. As previously an-
nounced, the Turners will be followed at this
house by Janet Achurch, who will be succeeded
by J. L. Sheridan, who will be ousted, it is said,
by Jennie Lee.

It is said that Grattan Riggs can imitate
four or five Irish dialects perfectly. George Rig-
nold (now restored to health) apparently knows
forty or fifty, but can’t make up his mind which
would go best with his hand-knit hose, so his
patter, like Sydney pavements, is a bit patchy.
All round, the performance is very much im-
proved, however, especially in the case of Harry
Jewett. “My Jack ”is said to be still in rehear-
sal, but “George” has at least five or six other
trifles in hand, and if he were to spring “Struck
Oil” or “The Messiah,” with himself in the
name-part, on the public no one would be sur-
prised. Now we hear that the Irish season pre-
ceding Easter will be occupied with something to
suit Maggie Moore. By the way, the Newsboys’
Brigade will be matineed at Her Majesty’s on
Wednesday, 11th March, under the patronage of
the Jerseys.
** * m
There is little to be said about “The Jilt,”
at Sydney Criterion, except that business has
been good, and that the withdrawal of Arthur
Lawrence gave George L. Gordon, out of the bill
for some time, a chance to appear as Daisy. The
dailies speak well of his performance; we didn’t
see it. “School ”is announced for Tuesday night,
and the reappearance of George Anson as Beau
Farintosh. The Beau isn’t one of his best.
“ Caste,” “ Ours,” “ The Squire,” are all under-
fined for production, it is said, but the next big
thing will be Tom Taylor’s “New Men and Old
Acres,” for which Churchward has come over to
paint the scenery.
At Grattan Riggs’ farewell appearance and
benefit, on Friday night last, “ The Yankee
Farmer,” a good old homespun story, was played,
in which the beneficiary’s fine New England dialect
surprised those who had only seen him in Irish
character, and J. P. West played an amorous
dotard with acceptation. “ Handy Andy ” fol-
lowed. It’s an age since we saw it last—it may
'be a chestnut, but there’s fun in it yet. Its most
noticeable feature was the drunken-scene between
Andy and the Murphy of Charles Seagrave. That
alone was worth the entrance-fee. The genial
and unassuming Riggs has sailed for Melbourne.

The boxing match at Coogee Aquarium
between Ryan and Williams was won by the
former in the fourteenth round of a Y.M.O.A.
encounter. Williams, the Bathurst heavy-paper-
weight, is a fat, flabby and jumbovine slugger
who prefers ha’pence to licks, and would sooner
sit down quickly than be sent to grass. Now 7 ,
his paper-made reputation is burst like a wind-
filled bun-bag, but he should have a fine future
before him as a policeman. Ryan is a finely-built
man, who has a lot to learn and time to learn it in.

At Sydney Gaiety, the Rickards matinee
was a bumper and the benefit at night filled the
building to boiling-over. Many bouquets were
sent across the footlights and Mrs. Rickards re-
ceived a very large and lovely wreath as a token
of goodwill from Mr. and Mrs. Davys, members
of the company. Exhausted by singing encore
songs at the close, “ ’Arry,” announced that he had
accepted a lump sum to extend the season for six
nights with a new bill. So far business has been
good.

The last days of Dr. Carver at Moore Park
are announced. On Saturday there will be a
change of programme, and the eminent shootist
will do some fancy work in the way of ball-break-
ing against time. Prices have been reduced
slightly and, barring wet days, the attendance is
good.

At Bondi Aquarium last Saturday a per-

another attempt next Saturday.

The Dual Swimming Club, which meets at
Pitt-street Natatorium on Wednesday evenings,
is five weeks old and has already a membership of
132. One side of the bath, to the water’s edge, is
screened by canvas beneath which ladies, robed
in the club’s uniform, a loose costume of navy-blue
sergerette, may drop into the water unobserved.
Initial shyness and an innate repugnance to wet
the back hair overcome, however, they wade in
with as much daring and abandon as the boldest
among the rougher sex. Indeed, at the deep end
ladies may be seen jumping off the spring board
and sliding down the shoot in the most matter-
of-fact way. The shallow end, however, provides
the best sport. There husbands may be seen
coaching their wives and little ones, some of
whom look scarcely old enough to be trusted
alone on the land, paddle about in all directions.
The bath can be maintained at an even tempera-
ture, right through the year, by the application of
steam from below, and is provided with hot and
cold showers. The hotel adjoining is clean, com-
fortable and well-appointed, and likely to become
popular.

Arthur Gordon’s Sunday afternoon and
evening water concerts have caught on. Last
Sunday night the Alathea was filled from stem to
stern, though not uncomfortably. After a run
up the Lane Cove River, where the concert was
given, she arrived at the Quay at 10 o’clock.
Several popular vocalists performed, and Harry
Rickards, having sung four songs, was not
allowed to sit down until he had promised to
“oblige again” next Sunday evening. Charlie
Faning will be “thar” in the afternoon, when
Tenor Cadzow will make a dulcet noise.
The omission of the little word “not”
from last notice of “The Middleman,” at Mel-
bourne Royal, made it appear that the house was
filled everywhere save in the dress-circle on
opening night. Matters were just otherwise,
however,_ and so remained until Saturday, when
business in the upper and lower regions indicated
that the merits of J ones’ strong play were begin-
ning to be noised abroad.

No one who was present on the first night
imagined that Cyrus Blenkarn would so soon be
confronted by dusty seats and benches, where the
casual spider found himself again at liberty to
renew the web that had been religiously swept
away by the brush of skirts and coat-tails during
pantomime season. But evidently the public
are slow to believe in drama at the Royal
after their bitter experience of the last
few months. Poor attendances have ap-
peared to depress Cartwright and weaken his
performance to some extent, nevertheless “ The
Middleman ” is respectfully spoken of by those
who saw it under the gloomiest of conditions.
Sass is perhaps too young and sprightly-mannered
for the pompous manufacturer, nor does he make
any serious attempt to humbug his family or him-
self. One can easily picture the character being
more effectively played on entirely different lines,
yet the present Joseph Chandler is consistent
enough all through, notwithstanding his Sassiness.
On the other hand, there is no sort of sense about
the conduct of Eille Norwood, who finally returns
from a two years’ tour of Europe wearing the same
suit of clothes that he started off in. This is
monstrous. Blenkarn might wear one set of
garments all that time, because he is a towzled
dreamer. But Captain Chandler, being merely a
creature of his tailor, couldn’t possibly retain the
affections of poor Mary if he were to cease
appearing in a nice new rig such as won her
heart in the first instance. No matter. “The
Middleman ” is about to retire in disgust, and on
Saturday (7th) the Cartwright-Nethersole com-
pany appear in “The Fortune of War,” for the
first time on any stage. This may, or may not,
be as sterling a drama as the other. Anyway,
it will have the assistance of 100 stage sojers and
a deal of gunpowder explosion. There is also
reason to hope that “ Rule Britannia ” will crop
up during the disturbance.

Many changes are threatened f< r the same
evening. “ Pepita ” is to run “ The Gondoliers ”
off the Princess’s bill, although Gilbert and Sul-
livan’s opera has fetched them freely. The
worship of Ryley is a little less violent than at
first, it is true,-and the ladies are said to be draw-
ing up a petition on the subject of that deity’s
front hair. It looks sticky rather, and he combs
an unaesthetic lock down over his godlike brow
just as though he were coming round from the
butcher for orders. Ryley will not be doing his
duty to sassiety until he sleeps with that lump of
hair in papers, and comes out at night in a curly
halo.

“Pepifea” is to be performed with many
variations from the original Melbourne cast,
which included Woodfield, Marnock, Nellie
Stewart, and Fanny Liddiard. Elton will get
there again, though, as our dearest and best
Pataquet; and this reminds one that Elton’s days
in Australia are numbered, and his farewell benefit
a function of the near future.

“ The Miner’s Right ” goes along steadily
at the Alexandra, and even though Dampier does
strike more gold on the stage than in the treasury
he has no particular cause for grumbling, all
things considered. The gallery boys support him
through thick and thin. fc When somebody is
winding him up from his alluvial claim in a
bucket you can hear the youngsters scream,
“Look out for Dampy!” And when Dampy is
brought to the surface the welkin rings itself
hoarse.

“ Doctor Bill ” is coming to a hilarious
end at the Bijou, and B. & B. will know him no
more after Friday, the W. & G. firm having made
arrangements to run Myra Kemble and her show
as far as New Zealand, with a fresh troupe of
kangaroo-dancers, and different doorkeys to those
now in vogue. The A church season opens on
Saturday with “Devil Caresfoot,” as already
notified. Herbert Flemming (who has graciously
consented to delay his departure for London, vide
advt.) takes a hand, and George Leitch, the his-
torical Insect, will likewise come in at some stage
of the proceedings.

At the Opera House they promise a three-
act comedy called “Kindred Souls,” in place of
“Skipped.” This mixed entertainment has
whirled around for four weeks, and the world
wondered when it intended to stop. That a col-
lection of songs, gags, incidental yarns, and baby-
chases could revolve round an oyster-stall for a
whole month is only to be accounted for by the
ability of Snazelle, Gourlay and Co. to do nothing
in particular, but do it very well. Some fresh
people are to be added for “Kindred Souls,” which
was played at Sydney Criterion some few years
ago.

A litter of performing pigs and a new
first part drew a screaming crowd to the Gaiety
on Saturday night. The influence of racing times
was perceptible, too, at the little Vic., the Wax-
works, Cyclorama, and a few other places, whilst
several backers of Bungebah celebrated the occa-
sion by dropping sixpence down a phonograph-
slot and getting some sort of noise for their
money. The present writer had a sixpenn’orth at
one of these machines when it wasn’t turned on
properly or something, and the result was a muffled
buzzing which sounded like a cross between Glad-
stone’s speech and a comic song, but was subse-
quently represented to have been a flageolet solo
from America. As a sound emanating from a
small box it was not lacking in interest. As a
musical performance it was demnable.

E. A. Stacey's “Hans the Boatman”
company is playing at the Adelaide Royal to good
houses, the simple story of the picturesque Swiss
boy having apparently lost none of its interest
since Charlie Arnold first appeared in that
character. Stacey has had the misfortune to lose
his dog, an important character in this little
comedy, but has substituted a prize-winning St.
Bernard, who introduced so much unrehearsed
business into his part during the week that his
histrionic success is somewhat doubtful. Stacey,
as Hans, and Miss Madge Grey, as Effie, have
both established themselves as favourites, and the
rest of the company has been up to the average.
Myra Kemble, supported by “Teddy” Royce
and other good people, opens there at Easter with
“ Dr. Bill.” A Panorama of Australia is being
exhibited at Garner’s Rooms, Adelaide, to fair
business. Mr. Fred Neebe makes an efficient
lecturer, and as the majority of the pictures are
well painted, the show is likely to catch on.
At Poverty Point.
Somebody remarked the other day, in print, how extra-
ordinary it was that three or four members of the amateur
dramatic club, to which Labertouohe, of Sydney,, be-
longed years ago, should have come to unhappy ends.
The remark evinces a sad lack of worldly knowledge and
reflection. To the man with a long memory and a soft
heart who looks back on the roll of those who during a
past 20 or 30 years have been his friends and acquaint-
ances, the world is as a shambles. Just think what has
become of all the actors and actresses we have known !
Frank Weston, of the Wizard He, and King-of-Sardinia
moustachios, turns up again on the Melbourne pav6. He
was returned as killed in Africa some time ago, but it
seems another Frank Weston, theatrical, goes about
obligingly getting drowned, or assegaied, in his stead.
Over 20 years since Frank debuted in a white ooat,
digging down and speaking a piece, over his Wizard Oil,
and then he was middleman with Tobias and Biancas
Hussey, and Big Sunflower Harry Kelly, on the corners.
It is some triumph to have outlived such men. A few
bottles still on hand.
There was great antagonism between Mrs. Kendal, as
Madge Robertson, and Walter Montgomery. It arose at
Nottingham while Montgomery managed there, and some
thought Madge had refused him. Out of the company
Walter picked no less than live other Juliets, to his
Romeo, in a desperate attempt to go one better than
Madge, but failed. Two days before his marriage, and
four days before his suicide, he wrote to an actor named
Sinclair that he was the happiest man on earth.
Government House, Brisbane,
February 20,1891.
Herbert Flemming, Esq., Theatre Royal.
Sir,—ln reply to your letter of 19th instant, I have to
inform you that Sir Arthur Palmer will not be present
this evening at the Theatre Royal.
His Excellency, having read the book on which the
play “ Camille ” is written from, objects to be present
with ladies at a play of its character.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
W. 11. D. Palmer, A.D.C.
The moral of this grammatical epistle is apparent: If a
thing—whether it be play, lecture, picture, or statue-be
moral, artistic, and good of its kind, it does not require
the imprint of the patronage of any man whose official
position has not been given to him because of his fitness
to pass judgment on such matters, but for wholly differ-
ent reasons. Patronage of this kind has a tendency to
secure temporary popularity for trashy wares, vended by
those who are keen and cute in self-advertisement to the
neglect of the more artistic and healthy productions of
those who follow Art almost as much for love of the beau-
tiful as for monetary gain and notability. It would be no
bad thing if gubernatorial snubs of this character became
frequent. The visits of a Governor to a theatre should be
unheralded and unproclairned, as private as those of any
ordinary citizen. Sensible men would prefer it. The
Governor whose back in the dress-circle is made an adver-
tising-stand on which to stick the bill of the play lowers
whatever official dignity his office may possess, and thosa
who invite him debase, to the same degree, their art, and
besmudge the true value of their histrionic goods.

No wonder. Greville was just built for the part.
It is said by Quiz, that after all the arbitrating and

“ Ah, O’est Ignoble !” was the exclamation of Napoleon
HI. when he first perused Kinglake’s first volume,
“Chums”—like Christie Murray and St. Maur. History

says of Desdemona; but we will not say more. Calypso
again, also Circe, Cleopatra, and Helen of Troy. As the
Tipton Slasher says: “Two friends, gents, will don the
mittens.”

After the finish of “ Aladdin,” at Melbourne Royal, the
company chased their stage-manager with a big, gold-
headed walking-stick, inscribed “From the boys and girls
to good old Teddy Royce, pantomime season, Melbourne,
1890-91.” Whereupon Teddy 7, in the usual course of
nature, acknowledged the compliment in “ a few appro-
priate words ”
He’ll reci-i-te, or be song-ster, again andaga-a-in.
Which is adapted from “Rule Britannia,” or something.
A London audience promptly resented the burlesque of
John Burns addressing dock-strikers, introduced in the
new extravaganza “Joan of Arc.” This was hissed clean
off the stage. Theatrical managers, and newspaper ones,
always try the wrong end of the stick first.
Jones’s play, “The Dancing Girl,” is apparently booked
for a twelvemonth’s run in London. It is Frenchy in
suggestion, but original, with its Quaker Phryne. Jones
bounds to the first position amid the dramatists, for this
play is held to be an advance even on Pinero’s “Profligate.”

Tales of the Old Regime.
No. II.—The Rationing of the Sentinels.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We told you* how Convict Jerricks' mother
carried unto Convict Jerricks’father —Dr. Rossell,
Commandant at Port Arthur—a clay-cast taken
from Convict Jerricks’ shoulders as he lay dead ih
his coffin.
This is the sequel to that tale. It is a tale by
itself, because we should be doing a gross injustice
to the Regime were we to leave 'undescribed a
single incident of the series which flowed from the
making of the death-mask. A convict’s kindly
act nearly always brought its Nemesis in the epoch
bf thfe Regime.
* * *
“Wud yer like a death-mask; a clay-
picter ? ” had asked Convict Symm, senior-grave-
digger at Dead Man’s Isle, of the Widow Jerricks.
“I ’udn’t do it ’cept for a mother. Anybody else
’lid split;”
There was no King's Regulation against the
manufacture of death-masks that Convict Symm
had ever heard of, but he was quite sure the men
in power would not approve of his attempt to give
consolation.to the poor, stricken woman who had
come down to the Settlement to clasp the living
form of her son in her arms, and had been ushered
to his corpse. The System did not, as a matter
of simple fact, approve of anything in the shape
of consolation being administered to any of its
suffering children. The Secretary of State for
the Colonies, who ordered that transports must
tear outof their hearts all the roots uf domestic love
and friendly affection, epitomised in a sentence
the policy which controlled the Regime. Convict
Symm, being a transport of some years’ standing,
was aware of the determination of the authorities
to stamp out the sanctities of human intercourse,
and had, therefore, as he- imagined, guarded
against the news of the death-mask reaching Com-
mandant Rossell’s ears.
“No mother ’ud split," was his thought, and no
doubt he was right in thinking that no woman
would ever consciously bring the man who had
procured her a memorial of her dead child to
punishment for his gracious deed.
Unfortunately, however, for Convict Symm,
when the Widow Jerricks showed the “clay
picter,” with its deep-sunk lines that so faithfully
reflected the ridges which the lash had raised on
her son’s back, to Dr. Rossell, her son’s father, she
forgot she was-also submitting it for the inspection
of Dr. Rossell, Commandant at Port Arthur, and
therefore to an official who was bound by every
legal and moral obligation to severely punish ia
prisoner who was so grossly insubordinate as to
convey Government property to a civilian.
As to the putative father of Convict Jerricks,
Dr. and Commandant Rossell shuddered when he
was shown the clay impression of the marks which
his fatal floggings had left upon his son’s shoulders.
He never for a moment doubted Mrs. Jerricks’
assertion that the young transport was his son by
her. The thing was so very probable. But, while
he shuddered, he recollected that he was Com-
mandant, and that as Commandant lie had a
solemn duty to perform.
It has ever been the proud boast of the British
administrator that at the call of Duty, self in his
case slinks out of sight. He will, if need, emulate
the Brutus, and lacerate his father’s heart to do
his duty to his country.
Commandant.-Rossell ordered Convicts Symm
and Mowbray to be brought before him on an
accusation of “delivering to a civilian Govern-
ment property within their charge."
On the Tuesday it was that the death-mask
nad been taken. On the Wednesday morning
Boat’s Crew No. 1 conveyed to Dead Island, in
addition to a corpse, a convict constable and two
men’s rations.
The grave-diggers—Symm, senior, and Mow-
bray, junior—were awaiting the arrival of the
boat. They had carried the bier to the strip of
shingly beach which the incoming tide was
petting gently and fringing with a lacework of
foam, and sitting upon it, waited, counting the
beat of the oars.
, “Two !” exclaimed young Mowbray. “That’s
a bit of bad luck, Symm—we’ve only six open
now. ” It was a rule that six graves at least should
be open every morning, in case of emergencies and
tushes of business.
“’Sh, ’Any !” answered his mate. “They’re
coinin’ too easy-like for two. It’s one and a pas
senger. When you’ve heard ’em as frequent as
me, lad, know as they can’t out the water
as clean as she’s comin now when there’s a brace
aboard. They can’t trim her so nice.”
“ ’Nother passenger? I hope not, Jim. Mark
my words, Jim, if ’tis, ’tis a sneakin’ cull J with a
jark || over that bit o’ clay yesterday. I’m afeard
we’ll be ’fore th’ Com’dant yet over that bizness.”
The boat laboured into sight. In the stern sat
a man wearing a straw hat and the blue-jean
jacket of the convict-constabulary uniform. Its
right arm was akimbo, and from its fingers
dangled a pair of handcuffs which glittered in the
sunlight.
“ ’Arry ’’—and Jim Symm panted painfully as
lie spoke, “yer right. That d woman as
split. I ’udn’t ’a’ thought it of a mother. But,
’Arry, yer don’t know nothink about that ’ere
mask. I’m on’y to blame. D’ yer see? ”
“ But, Jim, it’s a floggin’ matter. An’ I’m in it
a,s well as you.'’
“ Shot up, yer fool.” Jim Symm dropped his
voice to a whisper ; a dozen strokes would beach
the boat. “If yer in it, they won’t divide the
cuts, but’ll tie hup th’ pair of us.”
“ Rasy all—hold water —in oars—damn it, No. 3,
wot d’ye mean wash in’ the stiff ’un?”
No. 3, taking in his oar, has spooned some water
on the nameless coffin ; but returns the coxswain’s
rebuke by remarking with a chuckle
“Thought I’d baptise him, cox’en. You’ll bo
sure, sex’on, ho don’t go into unconsecrated
ground.”
The boat nosed the pebbled margin ; the grating
of her keel and a burst of ribald laughter sounded
the nameless transport’s requiem, as his coffin was
slid over the side and dropped with a “ woosh ”
on the beach.
The sextons were moving forward to place it on
the bier when the prisoner-constable stepped before
them.
‘‘Leave it alone for a while, prisoners, Yer've
got ter come along ter the Com’dant.’’
“ Wot for ?” demanded Symm.
“Wot the as that ter do with you?
Com’dant’s orders, that’s wot ’tis.”
“My orders are not to leave ‘Dead ’Tins’
without seein’of a written border,” said Symm,
firmly.
“I’m yer lorful s’pefior, ain’t I? Yer refuse
ter obey me at yer peril.”
“I won’t unless I see yer warrant.”
The constable turned to the boat’s crew.
- “In the King’s flame, ineu, yer ’elp—in-
subordiriet pris’ner.”
The men rose; there was fad resisting a call of
the kind even when issued sneaking cull.”
To have wavered in response was to hate lost their
comfortable billets.
“ Without a warrant ” —Symm had beguh a
fresh remonstrance, when jocose and loyal No; 3
struck him with his oar and brought him to the
water, into which he fell, face - downwards,
senseless.
“In the King’s name, Symm - an’ I owe yer one
a-cause yer wudvi’t give mb a smoke.” Several of
the creW laughed.
The younger sexton rushed iiltd the water and
lifted his mate’s head. The constable grasped
Symm’s legs, and then, with
A He,
And a Ho !
And a heave, heave, Ho !
swung his share of the inanimate burden into the
boat. Mowbray, supporting the head of the un-
conscious man, had clambered as best he could
over the gunwale when the constable told him “to
drop that.”
“ Drop wot ? ”
“ The ’cad o’ that insubordinet pris’ner.”
‘ ‘ Uou’ yer see, constable,
bus bad. lie ’as ‘leptic fits,
he ’as, reg’laiv The bind 'll
go to ’is ’uad if I drop it.”
“ Urop it, 1 say. Are yer
insnbordinet, too ? Yer a
pretty pair, my word.”
Reluctantly Convict Mow-
bray obeyed by resting
Syiurn's head on a thwart.
The constable snapped a
handcuff on one of Mow-
bray’s wrists. 'I fie other
clip was linked to Synnn’s
nerveless hand. And, so
coupled, the newly-
arrested prisoners were
rowed across t he bay to
the .Settlement.
“COULDN’T SHE?”
SHE (a good little woman with a separate estate, who would sell her soul for the old man)
“And now, dear, as we are so hard-up, why shouldn’t I mortgage my house
and raise some money?”
HE: “But then your mother lives in it, and if it were foreclosed on she’d be turned
out.”
SHE: “Well, suppose so; then she could come and live with us, couldn’t she?”
The coffin lay where it had fallen. Fifty yards
away a point of ashen shagreen, a broad pectoral
fin, rose from the curvature of a wave; further
out still, marking its sentinel path in huge evolu-
tionary circles a hideous hammer-head; and gulls,
in light-winged squadrons, hung over the surface,
innumerable, discordant, predatory.
At the pier steps the constable displayed
a not uncommendable anxiety to restore the senior
grave-digger to his senses. It was easting an
insult upon Justice for an offender to present him-
self at the Commandant’s Court with his wits
gone a wool-gathering, and therefore the officer
dashed a full bucket of water upon the recal-
citrant wretch, and then another, and finally a
third. Quivering in every muscle, with biting
and frothing of lips, with convulsive writhiugs
of the body and limbs so violent in their epileptic
force that Mowbray—to whom his mate was still
manacled—felt as though his arm were being
pulled from its socket, Convict Symm at last
awoke to a painful perception of his duty.
They pulled him to his feet, Mowbray swaying
with his every movement and partially supporting
him.
“ Water !” he craved.
“Ain’t yer had ’nuff?” grinned the minion of
the law, “ We’ve jest been a-givin’ of yer a good
lot.”
“ Water. For God’s sake, water !”
“We’ve left yer rashing over at ‘Dead tin’s.’
D’yer wan’ ter break the Systum with yer
extravagance? Yer sh’u’dn’t ’a’ come out a-
pleasurin’ so early, an’ then yer ’udn’t ’a’ gone
without yer rashing.”
“ Look ’ere, cox’n, give Symm my ratun for to-
morrow, will yer ? Oh, do, sir, do ! Yer can
stop it, yer know, w’en yer bring it across ! ”
Mowbray thus pleaded.
In the boat was kept a small water-keg, each
man of the crew being allowed, When ih service,
ah extraalldwanceofthtefluid. Theeoxswain,moved
by Mowbray’s appeal, would have granted the
request had the constable not interposed.
“ Yer do, cox’n, an’ I’ll tepoft yer. Yer know
the Reg’lashin about billet-men showih’ favours
to pris’hers. Jest take a fr’en’s advice, an’ leave
theste chaps ter me; Yer ain’t no call ter inter-
fere. I'm responsible.”
As he said these words, the constable thrust out
his chest and touched it; as if tb draw attention to
the fact that he was inspired by the tlirice-sacred
afflatus of office. And the raging thirst of the
poor devil went unquenched.

The two prisoners were before that Rhadaman-
thine officer, Dr. and Commandant Rossell. In-
vested with high magisterial powers of a degree
subordinate only to those exercised by the
Supreme Court Judge, the Police Magistrate at
Hobart Town, and the Principal Superintendent
of Convicts—the title of Comptroller-General did
not come into official use till a year or two later—
he sat in his office throned in the majesty of his
littleness, and in the virtue of a practically un-
limited authority. Men came into his presence
cowering, who had lifted unabashed foreheads to
the magnificent humbug of an Assize Court, and
left it liable to punishments unknown to the
latter and foreign to the spirit of English statute-
law of the time, Draconian though it was. Yet
among the two thousand odd sentences passed by
him, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
point out one which exceeded the discretionary
latitude permissible to him as a servant of the
State, to whom constitutional authority had
delegated enormous powers. Place in the hand
of any average man the Transportation Acts of
George 111. and IV. and the successive codes of
Kings’ Councils and Local Regulations; give him,
in the other, a commission “of discretionary
capacity ”; allot to him sovereignty, absolute in
all save in name, over the lives and destinies of a
thousand or two fellow-creatures who have been
deprived alike of all civil rights and of all the
influences of social privileges; sequester him and
them from the eye of the stranger; and you will
produce, first, a functionary like Dr. and Com-
mandant Rossell; and, second, a condition of
society which no voice dare speak and no pen
. describe, but which, notwithstanding, is para 1-
leled in the history of a dozen Australasian
localities. A Frankenstein created one monster :
the Regime Created many, sbme of whom tran-
scended in quality of terribleness the monster of
fiction by so much as an actual horror always
exceeds an ideal one. This diatribe has a purpose;
* * *
If he were a monster Dr. Rossell was
rather a pleasant-looking one as he appeared
seated at his desk with his round, florid face, his
hands, and his well-knit form so nattily set
off by his laced shirt and blue-uniform coat. But
we have Hamlet’s word for it that the Devil has
power to assume a pleasing shape, and the
amiability of the Commandant’s demeanour was
not incompatible with a devotion to the best in-
terests of the System.
“ What do yoii plead ? ” repeated Rossell im-
patiently. , “ Yoii’ve hbard the charge—what d’ye
say to it ? ”
“ Know nbthing ’bout it, sir I ” answered Mow-
bray. “ Don’t know what it means. I never ’lid
no prqputy of Gov’ment that any woman ’ud
want. ”
(< ‘‘We’ll see about that,” qfioth the Bench.
You plead not guilty. Are yoh Symm or Mow-
bray ? ”
“ Mowbray, sin He’s Symm, and, sir, he’s bad
“Hold-your tongue, Pris’ner Mowbray. Let
him speak for himself. Plead, Symm—guilty or
not guilty?”
Symm looked stupidly at the Bench. With rt
swollen tongue that hardly consented to perform
its office, he responded, “Water, sir.” The words
were mumbled, and it was no Wonder Rossell
misunderstood them, and considered that a current
cant phrase had been levelled at him.
“ Walker ! Walker I ” His insulted dignity
flamed out in sudden rage. “ I’ll Hookey Walker
you ! Warder Brewer, take him out and give him
a dozen. ”
Some constables stepped out of their rank to
obey the order, but Mowbray, forgetting for the
moment that he w T as still manacled to his brother-
convict, had that instant propelled himself
towards Rossell’s desk, crying “No, no! Beg
pardon, sir, but he’s bad, sir—be arsked for water
—he’s had a fit, sir.” Symm had yielded mechani-
cally to Mowbray’s rush forward, but the rude
hands of the convict-officers hauled him back by
the shoulders. Between the two, so sudden a
jerk was inflicted on the shivering unfortunate as
to once more drive him into epileptic convulsions.
He fell on the floor, pulling his mate down also,
and beat the planks with Ids head and feet. Not
a single creature of all the anointed scoundrelism
that pervaded the P. A. Hall of Justice, from the
Magistrate-Commandant to the newest “sneaking
cull, '’ but was convinced the man was really and
terribly ill. The force of habit, however, sug-
gested that the Commandant should request of
Mustering-Warder Brewer ;
“ Sure he isn’t shamming Abram, Brewer?”
A sudden writhe —a doubling of the body—a
bulging of great veins—and Mr. Brewer was
saved the trouble of answering, for Symm had
broken the bracelet which held him to liis fellow.
A severance of the handcuffs, “Y.D.L. No. 2B ”
pattern, was impossible to any man not endowed
with the superhuman strength which sometimes
nerves the epileptic and the lunatic. This Rossell
clearly recognised.
“Remove the pris’ner,” he said, “hospital,
temporarily. Never mind that ‘ dozen,’ Brewer.”
Brewer sainted in acknowledgment of the sur-
passing leniency which had prompted the remis-
sion of the 25 lashes. A “ dozen ” was always 25.
when it was a matter of cat-cuts. When it was a
ease of prisoners’ rations, it was usually 9 or 10.
The excess in the one case balanced the deficiency
in the other.
“ Now, Mowbray, you’ve pleaded not guilty,”
resumed His Honor. “But, of my own know-
ledge I know you or Symm was guilty. I saw the
clay—-I know it came from the graveyard—and
there was only one of you to give it to—ah, the
lady. Now, what have you to say to the charge ?”
The young sexton was almost anew hand. *By
one of these bits of luck which Dame Fortune
occasionally dropped from her overflowing horn
he had arrived at the Port just as a vacancy had
occurred in the junior diggership. A nine-
months’ voyage in that lazar-ship, the Katherine
Stewart Forbes (2), had changed his bone to
gristle and his flesh to skin. Hence he had been
appointed to the sextonship, which demanded
enormous muscular strength for its due fulfil-
ment. Such billets were all but invariably filled
in accordauce with the principle of the eternal
unfitness of things.
Nevertheless Harry Mowbray had not died.
Symm, his colleague in the grim function,
encouraged, helped him, amused him and kept
him alive. Here and there in the penal records
is to be traced the history of an old convict who
did not do his best to drive a young ’un to a lower
deep of infamy. Symm was such a one. He had
kept Harry alive, comparatively innocent—and
independent.
It was the last quality that prompted the
prisoner to retort upon the Commandant, with a
contemptuous merriment ringing out in the
syllables of the daring speeeh :
“ It’s the lump of mud wo made the mask of,
yer botherin’ of, is it? That’s Government
proputty, is it; Gawd ! yer Honor, I can’t help
a-larfing to think of this fuss about a bit o’ clay !”
Except for the echoes of his o-wn laughter, the
Court was silent. To thus beard the Commandant
to his face! ’Twas folly—rank madness! Then—
“By the Lord, pris’ner! I’ve known magis-
trates, who had they been sitting here, would
have hanged you for those words !” roared the
Bench. “You insolent scoundrel! Fifty for
insolence!”
Mowbray was forced into a now frightened
quietude. “ I didn’t mean no gab, yer Honor ”
“ Silence ! Who gave the woman the clay and

made the thing she called the mask —yourself or
Symm? Answer, prisoner.”
Symm had done both. The death-cast was,
indeed, Symm’s suggestion. But the prisoner
thought, in for a penny, in for a pound. He was
due for 50 -why - should he not take the dose
which Symm was certain to get if his share in the
transaction became known? Symm had been
kind to him--had consoled him when the home
sickness had shattered him with its misery—had
divided —O, supreme height of self-denial ! his
rare morsels of baccy with him. Reflecting on
these things, he resolved to lie. And lie he did—
bravely. .

second and tortured him. Had the woman Jcr-

dead convict? The indurated feelings of a gen-

gossip. As a man of courage, however, he would
face the doubt and fight it.
“So the woman was deceased’s mother, eh ?
And who was his father, did you hear ? ” Rossell
spoke with quite a pleasant humour, as though he
w as passing a little joke.
fn for a lamb as he was, Convict Mowbray,
other wise Deans, thought he might go the whole
sheep. No knowledge of the actual state of
aff airs; no suspicion even, nothing but sheer devil-
ment, prompted his retort.
“No, ’ow should I know? P’r’aps, yerself, yer
Honor—l ain’t been ’ere long, so 1 can’t say for
certain, but there's a "ole ’eap of orficers’ sons
doin’ time, I’m told. § You’ll know better’n me,
sir.”
That was the climax. The nasty, aggravating
chuckle accentuated the words, and the stung
sensibilities of the now maddened Commandant
nursed the insult as though his parental responsi-
bility for the dead derricks were patent to the
whole world.
The tw r o gravediggers were in company together
again that day. Before nightfall the junior had
joined the senior in the hospital. They occupied
adjoining beds—No. 12—Symm ; No. 14, Mow-
bray. Bed No. 14’s last tenant was one derricks,
since departed to “ Dead Man’s.”
* * *
In the silence of the midnight, an hour
when the gloom of the hospital ward took an in-
tenser tinge of awfulness from the memories and
legends which would cling to the rows of pallets,
No. 12 whispered to his neighbour.
“ ’Arry, lad, are you ’wake ? ”
“ Aye, Jimmy, I'm awake !” was the moaned
response. “ I wish I wasn’t—l wish I—was—
’sleep—for ever.”
“Don’t ye, now, lad, don’t ye 1 I’m so sorr>,
’Arry—it’s all my fault-all my—fault, sonny
A great sigh completed the sentence, and gained
for answer a gasping moan.
“ Did it ’urt yer much—Arry ? ”
“Orful—l ’erd the ’underd tally—don’t know
no more -’twas two ’underd I was tied—up
for .” Another groan.
“Poor ’Arry—an’ my fault! 0 Gawd !”
“Not yer fault, dim ! The mother’s.”
“ A mother to split, ’Arry ! Who’d ha’ thought
it, lad?”
“Blast her, Jim !—blast her !”
“Amen !”
# # #
An hour later. The wardsman’s night-
light flickered more feebly in the draught from an
open window; the wardsman snored more pro-
foundly. A sleeper in one of the “ odd numbers ”
turned restlessly and sobbed “ Wife !”
“ Jim !”
“ ’Arry ?”
“ That dead ’un—this mornin’s boat —you
'member ?”
“Yes,’Arry!”
“ Would—they send —others —to bury ’im ?”
A feeble laugh. Then—
“No, lad—they’ll wait till—we’re better.”
“ An’ if we didn’t get—better ?”
“The ’ammer-’eads ’ud take ’im. Thera sharks
’ll be uf> with the ’igh tide.”
“ Two o’clock, and All’s Well!” The tramp of
the patrol and the cry of their corporal awoke the
wardsman for a brief space. He lifted his whistle
to his lips, blew his response, and before the sound
of the marching feet had died away was slumber-
ing once more.
“ Jim ?”
“ ’Arry?”
“ Them sharks —they get rashings, don’t they?”
“ Reg’lar, an’ all cross-readers* as well. If you
an’ me were to kill ourselves, we’d be dropped
into Long Bay. The Com’dant caljs ’em his best
sent’nels.”
# * #
Half-past two. A hand protrudes itself
from No. 14 bed —the effort causing its owner to
groan subduedly—and touches the occupant of
No. 12, who is, at last, sleeping.
“Jim.”
“ Yes, sir.” Symm starts up, and brings his
hand to his forehead in salute.
“ Jim, it’s only me.”
“Oh, ’ivrry —thought’twas theCom’dant. Wot
is it.”
“ I’m agoin’, Jimmy, to them sharks.”
A pause.
Harry waited—not daring to express the hope
that had arisen within him. But Jim understood.
“ I’ll go with you, ’Arry—to ration—the ol’
man’s best senthels.”
The hands met in the space between the beds—
and clasped,
* * *
They waited till after “ three o’clock and
all’s well ” had gone by, and the return signal had
been whistled. And, then, when the stertorous
breath of the wardsman told of his heavy slum-
ber, they rose, feeling neither pain or exhaustion
in the exaltation of their resolve, and, Jim’s hand
to Harry’s back, moved step by step down the
room.
At the end were hanging on the wall at either
side of the open window two huge printed
placards : “ The Grace —Before and after Meat,”
one; the other, “Abstract of Hospital Regula-
tions.”
Harry tried to recall a prayer. He could not
do so ; and so, not daring, as they were close to
the wardsman, to again whisper to Symm, placed
his hand reverently on what he thought was the
“ Grace ” card.
The act was the Viaticum of his untutored soul;
nor dare we think that it will lose its savor, be-
cause in the dim and flickering light he made a
mistake as to the card.

About five years ago an Oamaru (N.Z.)
man lost a leg to a shark while bathing on the
local beach. A man on horseback rescued the
rest of him at the time, and he now goes about
with a wooden leg. The other day he was bathing
again at the same place, when the same shark
came round to collect the other limb. This time,
however, the Oamaruffian, on seeing his ancient
enemy, turned round quickly on his back, and
gave the monster of the deep a paralysing dig in
the ribs with his wooden leg. On recovering
somewhat, the shark turned tail and fled into
deeper water. The moral is obvious.

of upsetting the notion so generally entertained
that all the ability of Australia is concentrated in
Sydney.
J. H. Love, of Brisbane, after nine years’
residence in Foochow, solemnly writes“ What
i wish every Australian to understand is that, if
he loves his country, and if he loves his race, he
will give his life, if need he, to keep the Chinese
out of Australia.”
The Melbourne Trades and Labour Council
has asked the Victorian Premier to see that, when
plural voting is abolished, every member must be
returned by a majority of the electors who record
their suffrages at the poll. The Bux.letin claims
the credit of this suggestion.
G. H. Reid refuses to draw his official
salary as a N.S.W. M.P. In justification of his
refusal it may be said that he does not work in
Parliament except about once or twice a year,
when lie turns up and makes a splash with a
speeh he has written out and learnt by rote.
Says G. H. Reid “ There are men (in
Parliament) who would not get a rotten sixpence
in any business concern in the city ; they are men
who would shipwreck the smallest concern in the
universe.” The Bulletin is of opinion that
Parkes has herein the basis of a very good slander-
action.
Dowel, M.L.A. (N.S.W.) to a Tamworth
meeting “ I was not long in Parliament before
I was elected on the Parliamentary Public Works
Committee,' . . . The best men of the whole
Parliament were picked to represent Parliament
on the Public Works Committee.” Truth before
modesty.
“It is incumbent upon all the Victorian
delegates at the Federal Convention,” says the
Age, “ to remember that they represent a protec-
tionist colony in any discussion upon fiscal
matters.” Then the Age proceeds to advocate
intercolonial Freetrade with protection against
the outside world.
G. H. Reid is not in favour of Imperial
Federation —not because he wants Australia to
become an independent nation, mark you; but
because he fears—fears is the word—that any
attempt towards achieving Imperial Federation
might precipitate the consummation of the Aus-
tralian Republic ’
John Haynes denounces Wollongong
Stevenson for his “ change of front.” John s front
will never change.
“ One Nation — One Destiny ” is a beauti-
ful Federation banquet toast—but “One Man -
One Vote ” will require attention first.
Sir George Grey says .that the Federal
Convention may do great good or may retard
Federation for many years. True. Federation
is the Koch’s lymph of Australian politics, and
must be administered in infinitesimal doses.
G. H. Reid, seeing that Parkes is quadril-
ling sinuously towards Protection —and a Coalition
Ministry—wishes to squelch the old man. The
big importers of Sydney begin to feel that it is
time to shunt Parkes as dangerous. It may con-
fidently be predicted that the chief result of the
Federation Convention will be to raise, instead of
laying, the N.S.W. fiscal question.
Mr. Samuel Yaile, of Auckland, N.Z.,
claims to be the author of the doctrine that the
transit question underlies every other social
question, and that in any country where the
transit system is radically wrong, no other social
condition can be quite right.”- Mr. Yaile claims
the paternity of the Hungarian railway “zone"
system.
" Mr. Dowell, M L.A,, says that “there is
a great prejudice against Bruce Smith, because lie
is a Jew.” Then, in the words of the catechism,
“who gave him that name?” Answer —-“Ben
Amram and Shootem Jochabed, in his circum-
cision, wherein he was made a member of Moses,
a child of Joss, and an inheritor of the Kingdom
of Mortgages.”
In Brisbane a lot of workmen have been
disqualified as electors because they inserted their
street numbers in the application forms, instead
of the allotment numbers marked on the Govern-
ment plan. Some mean individual in the capi-
talist interest struck this brilliant quibble, and
his objection was upheld. The law is a handy
thing for anybody who has got money.
Treasurer M‘MiHan (N.S.W.) wonders
that he can’t get a hearing in public and attri-
butes it to the Protectionists. The political ran-
cour of which he complains is levelled, not at the
Freetrade Minister, but at the man who had the
work-people ridden down by troopers. At the
Government who said : “We must not now have
a general election, we cannot trust the people.
A proposition has been introduced into
the French Legislature making provision ;
(1) For the suppression of collateral inheritances ; for
the seizure by the State of the property of deceased per-
sons not disposed of by will; (3) for the sale, on instal-
ments of the real estate falling to the State in this
manner, as well as the larger part of the national and
communal domains, to the poorer agriculturists and
workers, on condition of occupancy and use.
Parkes will ; utterly fail to divert the at-
tention of the N.S.W. electors from fiscal and
domestic issues by his Federation dodge. In the
country the Protectionists will at least hold their
own ; in the town, the Labour Party—whose only
jiresent concerns are the federation of labour and
the complete derhocratisation of the electoial sys-
tem, arid ' who are know-nothings on all other
points—will completely “ down ” his nominees.
Next North Brisbane Parliamentary elec-
tion may bring out four candidates —Premier
Griffith and G. Edwards (both Welshmen,) against
John Donaldson and T. Finney. The Premier’s
vis-a-vis opponent, Donaldson, is leader of the
Opposition ; while Edwards and Finney are rival
drapers. Treasurer MTlwraith, who now sits for
North Brisbane, may contest Bur mm with
“ Charley ” Powers, against whom he has an bid
grudge.
Prof. C. V. Riley, U.S. entomologist for
the Department of Agriculture, has created a
sensation in America by declaring that man’s
position has been attained through millions of
years of sexual selection on the part of the females
of his own race and of the anthropoid apes and
other inferior species from which he has sprung,
and that the institution of artificial sexual equality
would be a mere kicking-down of the ladder by
which he has climbed.
A paragraph that, if read aright, furnishes
a lesson in political economy for West Australian
legislators :
The chairman of the Western Australian Land Company
writes to the Financial News (London) to express the
opinion that the soil (of Western Australia) is good and
virgin, and the climate superb, so that if the new Govern-
ment will only avail themselves of the experience and
errors of the eastern colonies, and borrow and expend
with prudence, a glorious and prosperous future of
Western Australia is close at hand.
In other words, if the W. A. Government borrows
and spends with prudence, a glorious and pros-
perous future awaits the absentee shareholders in
the W. A. Land Co.
Premier Parkes pointedly omitted to send
The Bulletin a ticket for the Federal Convention
dinner while extending invitations to all sorts
of syncope-stricken rags. The Bulletin pub-
lishes this merely for public information—it does
not yet want a dinner, it did not apply for a
ticket, and it scorns to ask favours from the
plausible old sneak who is so notoriously addicted
to wreaking paltry revenges on his critics.
Parkes, G.C.M.G., cannot patronise the Repub-
lican Bulletin, which, though its conductors
have, for the most part, been ccmtent to work in
the obscurity of a newspaper-office, • has made a
lot of real Australian history.
Apropos of Lord Londonderry, the Evictor-
General, 20,000, and more, brawny, right arms are
(cable) raised in rebellion, because this big iron
master, this Brassey, turns out his ..Silksworth
tenants, demanding implicit obedience, on the
basis of a ukase which the Londonderry of 1837
issued to all his slaves in Durham, making a sen-
sation all through England. The Marquis and
Marchioness of Londonderry of that period joined
in a circular to all their tenantry, commanding
them to vote for a Conservative M.P., on pain of
being evicted. Wise they were, those Castle-
reaghs, who saw the storm coming. What a
charming historic name in Britain is Castlereagh,
the man whose very dead remains were groaned
by a London mob, at the funeral!

A member of N.S.W; Government House
staff intimated to a pressman the other day that
Governor Jersey’s name should be pronounced as
spelt; and not “Jarsey.” It appears that a lot of
people speak of the Earl as Jarsey, and he “don’t
like it, you know.” “Derby ” is “Darby;” why
isn't “ Jersey ” “ Jarsey?”
* # *
The Stkte-scliool children of Penrith,
N.S.W., were compelled to go through the farce
of presenting Governor Jersey with a complimen-
tary address on the occasion of his wasting a
bottle of bad fizz and turning on a water-cock the
other day. This complimentary address was read
by a boy and presented by two girls, but it was
siened by teachers “on behalf of the teachers and
scholars.” This disgusting and bogus document
is, of course, “ another striking evidence of the
loyalty of the native Australians to the throne and
person ”of V.R. Here it is -
While loving well Australia, our native land, we are
also proud of Britain, our glorious mother-land. Your
Excellency’s kindly presence here to-day is a new link in
the chain which binds us to the throne of Victoria, our
sweet and gracious Queen.
Here insert the latest fancy portrait of “our

The indispensable condition of our recent
visitor young Lord Dudley’s aspiring to the hand
of the Brince of Wales’ daughter is that he shall
“retire from business.” What a commentary on
the grand cardinal principle of Society, even in
Australia, that Labour is Dishonourable, and work
Disgraceful! Yet the line of Dudley would have
gone extinct but for business, 200 years ago. The
broken-down Earl married the rich daughter and
heir of plain Master Humble Ward, the King’s
Jeweller.

We are told that a rule nisi for divorce
granted in camera six months ago to a more or
less distinguished N.S.W. politician was made
absolute last week—also in camera. According
to this there is a law for the rich and influential
and a law for the poor and uninfluential. Also
there is a sup-Bress for the rich and influential.

Myles M‘Rae, the burly, uncouth member
for Morpeth in the N.S.W. Assembly, was neatly
“had ”in the Divorce Court. Mrs. M‘Rae had peti-
tioned fur a divorce, and the giddy Mac, no doubt
thinking that he was going to be made quite free,
offered no defence —whether he could have made
a defence in any case we are not aware. The
petitioner, in support of her claim, tendered all
sorts of damning evidence ; Myles had beaten her
in the street; had seduced a girl under
promise of marriage, saying that he had divorced
his wife; had also been guilty of a number of
other disgraceful acts, having, for instance, gone
about naked in her (Mrs. M'Rae’s) house in the
presence of the servants. She added that though
she had been married to him for 20 years, she had
not cohabited with him for more than four years
in all. These facts having been put in evidence
practically without cross-examination, Mrs.
M‘Rae’s adviser suddenly requested that as the
petitioner, being a Roman Catholic, could not
conscientiously accept a divorce, a judicial separa-
tion should be granted. This was agreed to by
the judge, and the bold, bad Myles, who is under-
stood to aver that he didn’t defend simply because
he wanted to be divorced, lias still all the definite
and indefinite responsibilities of a married man.
* * #
Myles M‘Rae, M.L.A., was constantly in
and out of the N.S.W. Divorce Court during the
hearing of the suit for judicial separation brought
by his wife, and appeared to derive considerable
entertainment from the evidence. His “victim ”
(Miss Vaughan) is a pretty girl, with a most
attractive svelte figure, and a lovely head of
golden-brown hair. She gave her evidence in a
most matter-of-fact fashion, and certainly did not
appear to “feel her position keenly.” She is
sweet seventeen.

It is not the Ashmead-Bartlett who married
the venerable Baroness Burdett-Coutts who has,
as cabled, got publicly into trouble with a woman.
That enterprising youth changed his name, and
is known as Mr. “Burdett-Coutts.” The man
now in a tight place is Burdett-Coutts’ brother,
Ashmead-Bartlett, who is a junior member of
the Salisbury Ministry, and runs a paper which
used to be called England. This paper, which
is now called The Beople, has, or had a few years
ago (we have not seen it lately) a tolerable circu-
lation. Bartlett’s troubles will be a godsend to
Barnell, for no doubt Bartlett has made much
Tory political capital by commenting, as is his
wont, virtuously and in most scathing terms on
the social iniquities of the Irish leader. As
already stated, Burdett-Coutts, “husband” of the
barren Baroness, who is old enough to be his
great-grandmother, is not yet in trouble, but if he
is built like ordinary men, he probably will be
Some of these fine days. We are sorry, for his
reputation as a man, that he isn’t in trouble
already.

The French Club* Sydney, which, alas,
bonsisted in its latter days chiefly of German
gentlemen With enormous appetites, has been
wound up with considerable loss to those respon-
sible. From its assets is to krise the Cosmd l
politan Club, a limited concern, capital £2OOO in
£1 shares, which will take over the liabilities of
the old club oh a new system abolishing entrance
fees and receiving as members only those willing
to beedme shareholders and whom other members
consider eligible.

The N.S.W; National Club has also burst.
We must One day write its history under the title
of “The Grindstone Club.” The primary cause
Of its inception was possibly the fad that a cer-
tain illustrious (we speak more ot less seriously)
gentleman qharrelled with Lis dinner or something
at the Australian Club and determined to run a
show of Lis own. He had (and fortunately still
has) plenty of money, and was prepared to spend
it plentifully in certain directions, and so the
National Club was established with the avowed
object of encouraging Brotection and promoting
social harmony among Broteetionists. But
A JUDICIOUS RESERVE.
LADY J.: “As I’ve only been in the country 36 hours I have hardly yet made up my
mind about your politics.”
“ business ” not being “ brotherhood,” the two
things were utterly incongruous, and so there-
fined old scientist very soon found. He could
furnish a club, but he couldn’t make a home.
Who could not fail to feel sorry for him when a
couple of prosy political bummers droned their
commonplaces into his ears for hours at a stretch ?
“ That pamphlet which I wrote in 1802 ” ; “ that
splendid speech I delivered to the electors in
1847” —what ghastly torture it must all have
been ! And now the Freetrade papers are chaffing
the members about the sale of the club effects—
the “two butter-knives,” “two meat-skewers,”
“ two pickle-forks,” “one pair of lace curtains,”
“four bottles of rum,” “three bottles of gin.”
Three bottles of gin ! How could anybody or
anything be National on only three bottles of gin?
# # #
However, the moribund N.S.W. Free-
trade and Liberal Association can’t afford to poke
borak at the defunct National. For years past
the former has sponged on Mayor Bnrdekin, who
has found it in board-and-lodging, and, if the
truth were known, probably in washing also. The
secretary has resigned—chiefly, no doubt, because
there was no money to pay him, and The
Bulletin is not aware if the members have in
their corporate capacity even one butter-knife or
three bottles of gin to their name.

We have not heard anything lately about
Rupert Oarington’s prospective marriage. Beople
who know Rupert well aver that he is so bashful

When Bank-manager Bennett got away so
neatly from Sydney, leaviog behind him a short-
age of £30,000 or so, people marvelled and thought
him wonderfully adroit. Success begets confi-
dence. Bank-manager Bradley, who also leaves
behind a bulky deficit, was not content with
escaping himself, but is believed to have escaped
with his wife and family—he even took a servant
along ! The next absconding bank-manager-mm-
Sunday-school teacher may be expected to elope,
not only with his wife and family and servant,
but with his furniture and the bank’s safe and
premises also, while the fellow after him will kid-
nap all the bank’s reserve bullion and take away
the Board of Directors in a cage! What smart
men are the detectives, if you only tell them all
about it!

Chesterfield on etiquette says the shoutee
must always deferentially follow the shouter into
the bar, and the correct thing, especially in the
case of policemen, is to glance both up and down
street, then drag in your limbs with evident
langour and unwillingness. Axiom : No man
takes it because he likes it. It is all the work of
tyrant custom.

Dear Bulletin* —Can you inform me why
the next two statues to be placed in the niches of
the Sydney Lands office are to be those of Burke
and Wills? Beyond the fact of affording matter
for newspaper articles and paragraphs, I really do
not know what distinguished services they ren-
dered New South Wales, or even Australia. In
common justice, the men to occupy the place of
honour, before anybody without exception, should
be Flinders and Sturt, the one representing the
exploration of the coast, the other of the interior.
And as the two men to whose memory Australians
have behaved with the greatest ingratitude, some
slight amends should be made. — Delcojiyn.
[Quite right. The “reason” why Burke and
Wills are “statueised ” and the others neglected
simply is that Sir Henry Barkes, who attends to
all such matters, and will brook no interference,
pretends that he is acquainted with Australian
history, and yetis as ignorant of it as he is of the
technicalities of verse-making.— Ed. B.]

knickerbockers going about Melbourne carrying

The very latest Sydney bank-defaulter is
of the stereotyped pattern—musical and mashing,
pious and priggish. He affected lawn-tennis,
choir-practice, and Sunday-school teaching. A
loudly-proclaimed love for God seems to manufac-
ture embezzlers faster than a proclaimed passion
for riotous living. The subject courts enquiry.

Says the Master of the Rolls: “I know
hundreds of young men in London who, if they
were told that their trousers were made by begin-
ners, would go mad !” Just so ; we’ve seen ’em.
They walk the streets of Australian cities for
weeks after arrival with their check pants rolled
up at the bottom to reveal their stout boots and
big feet; then they gravitate to the parks and
turn down their hems to hide their battered,
bulgy feet-coverings, and would gladly wear sack-
cloth by way of trousers if it could be got for
nothing, and they fight with unregistered dogs at
midnight among the ashes of dirt-boxes for scraps.
Finally, they’re to be found (if “ wanted ”) clothed
in gill-sodden imbecility, grease, and' patched
pants, peeling potatoes for their tucker in six-
penny restaurants,

The habits and customs even of the “ aris-
tocracy ” are changing, and the secret of England’s
greatness, which formerly lay concealed in blue
blood and the Bible, must have shifted its quarters.
Tummy, in his own royal person, has, it is cabled,
himself held an enquiry into the case of a
baronet accused of cheating at cards, and has
sentenced his noble friend to total abstention from
such vanities during the remainder of his natural
life. In the good old days no “ swell ” could cheat
at the gaming table, unless lie were guilty of a
perfectly monstrous act, like the indecent exposure
of fifteen kings up his sleeve. It is told of George
Bayne (who has not been dead ten years) that
when a young greenhorn asked his advice as to
the proper way to deal with an earl whom lie—
the greenhorn—detected in a smart b t of. huffling,
Bayne replied—“ Say nothing, but hack hisplay. ”
The veteran George was sans peur ct sans reproche
as a gambler, but according to the code of club
honour in wdiich he had been trained it was worse
“ form ” to accuse a man of cheating than to cheat
oneself. The proper thing to do was to avoid
playing with parties who enjoyed unnatural
“ luck,” and run no risk of being mixed up in a
“ scene,” So it happens that Queen Victoria, being
well-grounded in the old style of etiquette, tore
around her State apartments and threw the
Imperial crown at the royal tortoiseshell cat when
she heard that her Heir Apparent had assisted at
a row which was worthy only of a pot-house
parlour. The Bulletin doesn't suppose for a
moment that the aforesaid Heir was implicated in
any swindle except as a victim, although nasty
things have evidently been suggested in certain
London papers. Even his intimacy with older
and more experienced card-sharpers than this Sir
William Cumming(anobleman w hose “mug-catch-
ing ” is a common joke amongst the riff-raff of
the racecourse) doesn’t prove anything against
Tummy, seeing that he probably knows less than
other people. No, so long as there is a British
Revenue left to pay his debts, the breath of
rational suspicion will never tarnish Tummy’s
reputation at the card-table. This seems a favour-
able moment for singing the National Anthem.

The blacklegs who have gone to Queens-
land to help the local squatters in the struggle
against the Shearers’ Union, are mostly Victorian
station and farm hands, who, raised on the rich
freehold estates of the Western District squatters,
choose to regard themselves as retainers of the
latter.
In connection with the fire at the Mel-
bourne Railway Left Luggage Office one indivi-
dual claimed £5O for his portmanteau, alleging
that it contained no end of valuables. But luckily
“MY BOY.”
His mother cries, “ My boy!” and strokes
Her stalwart darling’s hair ;
He merely strolls away and smokes,
And doesn’t seem to care.
Her heart may be as good as gold
Without the least alloy,
Cut Tom is tired of being told
That he’s his mother’s “ boy.”
But when the stars, like little lamps,
Are winking fitful winks,
Along a dusty road he tramps
Beside a skinny minx ;
She’s selfish, plain—a trifle seems
That damsel to annoy,
But yet she fills his thoughts, his dreams,
Because she whines “ My boy ! ”
They marry, and he settles down
Upon a humdrum plan ;
The wife she wears an ugly frown,
And calls him “ My old man.”
This is a world of work and pain,
With little left of joy,
Where nothing makes Tom young again
But mother’s fond “My boy !”

The Gordon-Cumming case reminds us
that many years ago Messrs. Hawksley and
Williamson,, proprietors of the Sydney journal
known as The People’s Advocate, were charged
with libelling Capt. Fitzroy, A.D.O. to his
father the Governor, by publishing an article to
theeffect that the captain had been horsewhipped at
Parramatta by a Mr. Beit for cheating at cards.
The defendants were fined £5 each; and spent six
Weeks in Darlinghurst Gaol.
Tlie whole secret of the Carmelite Nun-
nery trouble at the Warren, Sydney, is just this :
The local founders of the Order arrived in N.S.W;
anticipating that they would strike a rich gold-
mine with an inexhaustible lead of heiresses.
They were 12 in number, but provided accommo-
dation for a great many more, and, to do So. got
into debt to the extent of over £lO,OOO. This did
not trouble them at the time; as they reckoned
they would be. able to pay it all off slick, out bf
the “ dowries ” of the rich girls they were going
to catch. in that, however, they calculated
without their host. It was an easy thing to pro-
vide for new nuns, but it was quite another thing
to get them. And this was where the
Cardinal did not come in. Every Carmelite
is required to bring her dowry into the
concern, and those who lack dbwer need
not apply. A Cardinal who regarded the
Useless and morbid nunnery system with a favour-
ing eye could, c f course, by a suggestion here and
there, introduce a good many world-weary young
ladies with coin to the fold ; but Cardinal Moran
isn’t built that way, and the result is that,
although the Carmelites have been in Sydney be-
tween five and six years, they have, we are glad
to kn:w, been successful in bagging only one Aus-
tralian. They are consequently in debt. One
fat heiress would wipe out the deficit, and smooth
the path of the Carmelites for the future. But
the Cardinal,looks askance, and, for the presen
at any rate, “heiresses is hoff !”

Although Alderman Clark, “ merchant
tailor,” was Unanimously elected Mayor of Bris-
bane, his nomination for that office seems to be a
pure fluke, for as Brisbane is just now going
through the worst commercial year it has eve.
faced, other aldermen were reluctant to stand.
“ Blue Ribbon ” Clark has thus achieved tlie
second landing in his visioned staircase of fame ;
his next is to attempt to become M.L.A. for For-
titude Valley, or Nundah. Before the Griffith-
MTlwraith coalition, and when the Griffith party
was “solid,” it was understood-that John A.
Clark had the nomination of the then powerful
Sir Sam for the Valley seat; but now political
parties in Queensland are hopelessly mixed, and
will be perhaps hopelessly reconstructed. Still,
the reformed social reformer dreams on. As
commensurate with his new dignities, he has taken
a big house at Teneriffe, famous for the excessive
hospitality of “ the Wilsons,” and rips around
Brisbane in a buggy. As Clark must remain
loyal to his Good Templar’s oath —“not to sup-
ply, or cause to be supply to any person,” any sort
of “ pizen ” —his Mayoral allowance of £6OO ought
to see him through his year of office and leave a
small balance for ’oss-feed and ’armony.
# * *
One of the first mayoral acts of Blue-
Ribbon Clark, of Brisbane, was to employ a
labourer to carry away the grog “remnants ’’ left
by his predecessor in the mayor’s room. The
mayoral bin is, we believe, now stuffed full of
hop-beer, nosypop, and other mysteries. Mayor
Clark is, however, a terrific smoker, and, since his
aldermanic sun rose, largely favours cigars. Once
he forswore baccy for a year and a day, and pre-
sented a reporter with his pipe, as a token that he
was in deadly earnest. Next morning the re-
porter met him wearing in his mouth a weed as
big as a belaying pin.

At Sydney Natatorium (swimming-baths)
—the waters whereof are sacred to ladies on
Monday nights—a very kittenish damsel put in
an appearance immediately after the expiration of
the males’ bathing-term, and incidentally gathered
that the men had just left. “Oh! is that soV’
exclaimed Miss Kitten, indignantly, “they have
just been swimming here, have they ! * Well,
then, I won’t risk going into the water, and I
won’t come here again, and I won’t allow any of
ray young lady-friends to come here. There now!”
And out she flounced.

The trial of engine-driver Phelan for a
Melbourne murder, was illumined by just one
little gleam of artless humour. A female friend
of the unfortunate wretch was put into the box to
testify that she had seen him “look eccentric ” on

would be likely to hang ’Enry Parkes after taking
a good “ liker ” at his ’ead.

Several ladies are now making a good in-
come in London as professional face-washers. It
is claimed that the average society female has not
the faintest idea how to wash her face, and con-
sequently her countenance accumulates, in a
manner of speaking, and once a fortnight or so the
professional attendant comes round and gets up
arrears. According to one prominent operator, it
takes a good deal of heavy shovelling, too. The
patient’s features are washed for half an-hour in
twelve different waters, and then the lighter
shades of the picture are filled in with cold cream,
and after that the countenance is massaged for
another half-hour, and when the massage is over
there is some more washing, and the sufferer is
dried with a soft silk handkerchief. The pro-
ceedings conclude by the professor of cleanliness
slapping her client vigorously to promote circula-
tion, and if she also chased her for two miles with
a hoe in an uphill direction in order to strengthen
the muscles, and then chased her home again to
create an appetite, the treatment would leave
nothing to be desired.

The English papers are telling a joyous
story about a small, effeminate-looking burglar
who, finding that he was badly wanted by the
police, disguised himself in female attire, and got
a situation as lady’s-maid. He was an affable
and lady-like burglar, and though he was rather
awkward at first he speedily became invaluable,
especially at hair-dressing and similar personal
services. Then the police got on his track, and
when the lady-like girl, who had been treated
almost as one of the family, was run in under the
name of Bill Smith, his employer and her two
daughters made three separate and individual
back-somersaults, and went into frantic hysterics
on the floor. They have advertised for a new
maid since then, and in the advertisement they
state that any woman who isn’t provided with
references testifying that she is a female needn’t
apply. When they take down their back hair at
night they do it with a shudder, for they remember
how, for two dreadful years, that back hair was
taken down for them by a burglar ; and the same
lawless housebreaker helped them to dress for
dinner, and they were wakened every morning by
a coarse and brutal, malefactor ; and when they
were unable to sleep they used to ring the bell for
a robber attd get him to read to them. And not
only do they know these things, but all their
friends kttow them too, and talk about them ; and
when they see two horrid females laughing to-
gether in a ball-room, they feel as if three separate
oysters were walking up and down their delicate
spines.

An Adelaide man, sued by an undertaker
for the funeral-expenses of his defunct wife,
pleaded “not indebted,” calmly claiming that,
though the law insisted on his maintaining a live
wife, it did not compel him to bury a dead one.
He took his stand on the marriage ceremony which
enjoined on him (he said) a contract that only held
good “till death us do part,” and argued that his
wife’s demise ended his worldly interest in her,
and that he owed no obligations towards her
corpse. He had to pay.

and fastened at the waist With a band of white ribbon,
bands of ribbon falling at the back of the skirt; small

until there is reasonable expectation of profit will
capitalists engage in the extension of existing in-

they do so there can be no revival in business and
no increase in the avenues of employment.”
Indeed ! Meanwhile, what do they live on ?
Capital or bank-interest? If the latter, and the
odds are 100 to 1 on, then they give just as much
employment to labour as under any other circum-
stances.

As easy for the camel to go through a

in case of a tie. (2) There is nothing in this to upset the

pretty big order. Anyone who fully agrees in everything

son “Nyngan”: Yes, he was there. The blood was
running and the glorified pork-butchcr felt quite in his
element “ M.M.” : Please don’t read The Bulletin to

is under present circumstances purely class legislation in
favour of the employers “A.J.W.”; S.A. pastoralists
gave way to the shearers on nearly all points, but the
shearers maintain that this is merely bluff and comes
from the necessity for confining the fight to Queensland
for the present. [Many letters held over.]
Gladestone is close-fisted. When o list
was being read in the Commons of various pub-
licists who had given money to forger Pigott, the
Radicals wore alarmed lest Gladstone should be
included. “Don’t be afraid,” said Labouchere,
“ the G.O.M. never subscribes to anything.”
Parkes is, he says, engaged in “creating
what will be the most magnificent jewel in the
crown .of our great Queen.” The Bulletin is
engaged in recovering from the crown of a most
commonplace brood of Germans a stolen jewel
that is the birthright of the Australian Republic.
Circumstances alter cases. If Captain
O’Shea had made his charges against the Prince of
Wales, the world would have believed him, and
the British Pharisees would have remained silent,
but when Parnell is charged, the world holds very
serious doubts, and the British Tories and
Pharisees go out whooping on the war-path at
once.
At the Imperial Federation Banquet, when
the health of Lord Jersey was drunk, Mr.
Hallewell sang, according to the papers, “ A
Good Old English Gentleman.” When Parkes’s
’ealth ’ad been given, the band played, so the
papers say, “ A Fine Old English Gentleman.”
After all, there really is a lot of difference between
a “ good ” old English gentleman and a “fine ” old
English gentleman.
Says the Twentieth Century :
General Booth’s scheme is merely a charitable enter-
prise, which would not change, to the extent of an iota,
the present conditions by which paupers and drunkards
and harlots are manufactured a hundred times faster than
he could reclaim them if his scheme should prove suc-
cessful beyond his wildest dream of hope. It would leave
the Land Lord and the Lend Lord as powerful as now.
• . . Booth means well, but he is only one of the great
army of philanthropists who are interfering with the
natural action of present social forces, and contributing
to prevent their natural consequences, and hence he is
doing harm when he means to do good. All charitable
or purely so-called philanthropic organisations should lie
abandoned, in order that the land, money and trans-
portation monopolies should be left to do-their perfect
work of degradation, starvation and death. The people
would then more quickly learn the real causes of their
misery and would remove them.
Irrigation for New South Wales.
ITS ADVANTAGES AND PROSPECTS.
During the last year or two, more than ordinary
attention has been directed to the value of irriga-
tion on account of the immense success attaching
to the efforts of the Chaffey Brothers in Victoria.
In that the colony have devoted large funds to
the purposes, and numerous Trusts have been
formed to carry out the work of fertilising various
parts of the country. Yet, in N.8.W., nothing
whatever has been done by the Government
towards the improvement of the vast areas of land
throughout its borders which, given sufficient
moisture, is stated by experts to be equal to any
wheat and fruit-producing country in the world.
This supineness may, indeed, be characterised as
almost criminal, when the immense advantages to
be gained by the system are taken into considera-
tion, and it is borne in mind what an enormous
population could be settled on country now
populated only by sheep and rabbits. Not only,
however, is there a direct disadvantage to the
farming population by the absence of any general
scheme or provision for the introduction of a
Government system. Private enterprise is stunted
and capital which, if it were possible to have it
invested without the worry and expense of passing
a special Bill through Parliament, is directed to
other channels. If there were even some pro-
vision by which irrigation on a systematic scale,
and under certain restrictions, might be carried
out privately, very much might be clone. But, as
matters now stand, any attempt to introduce the
system by corporations or individuals meets with
difficulties at the outset, inasmuch as a Bill has to
be introduced, and after much vexatious and ex-
pensive delay, it is often eventually shelved, and
there is the risk that from interested motives it
may be thrown out altogether. This has to a
certain extent been the experience of the
Land Company of Australasia, who may be
ranked amongst the pioneers of the move-
ment in this colony. During the last
session of Parliament, a Bill was introduced by
Mr. Abigail proposing to give the Company
power to conserve a portion of the waters of the
Page and Hunter Rivers for the improvement of
their celebrated Segenhoe Estate in the Hunter
Valley district. This Bill, after being advanced
to some extent, was amongst the measures which
remained unpassed at the close of the session,
though it will be taken up at the same stage next

No finer opportunity could be given, perhaps,
than that afforded by the Company’s Segenhoe
Estate to test the advantages of irrigation on the
soil of this colony. It is estimated that some 9000
or 10,000 acres of land on the Estate are eminently
suitable for agricultural and orchard purposes,
the only desideratum wanting to success being
an efficient water supply. The soil itself is
generally a beautiful, thick, volcanic loam,
which shows in some places on the banks
of the river to a depth of nearly 30 feet, and
an analysis of its constituent properties in-
dicates that it is capable of producing marvellous
quantities of cereals and fruit. In the latter
respect, perhaps, the land is scarcely equal to that
on the Company’s famous Ravensworth Estate,
the character of which is such that fruit-trees
develop there marvellously owing to a natural
system of underground irrigation, caused by the
shingly bed and water-flow under the loamy sub-
soil. Further notice will, however, be directed to
this property in a future issue. On the Segenhoe
Estate, on the other hand, the soil is in itself far
richer, and it needs but the one element—water—
to make it capable of producing unlimited crops.
It is comprised largely of wide flat reaches—
similar to that depicted in the photograph repro-
duced above —apparently formed in days long
past, by the action of flood-water from the higher
lands, which has brought down the soil and
deposited it on the level country below. Nowa-
days, however, no such thing as a flood
is ” known, and the land remains, no longer
disturbed by water, which, in fact, is required
in moderate quantities to develope its fertility.
The estate is situated in the Hunter Valley,
perhaps the most valuable stretch of country in
the colony. Within its borders is the junction of
the rivers Page and Hunter, so that, in addition
to wonderfully rich soil, ttiere is plenty of water
to hand for irrigation (now flowing as waste
into the ocean) which but requires the artificial aid
of man to turn it to account as a fertilising agency.
Altogether, the estate comprises 26,000 acres, and
prior to becoming the property of the Company
it was owned by the late Hon. James White.
That its fattening properties have been well
proved is shown by the fact that for 50 years past
it has carried an average of 4500 head of cattle.
Altogether, about 5600 bullocks are turned off
the estate every year, and these are mostly
purchased by Mr. Ben. Richards, the well-
known carcase butcher. Situated close to
the main trunk railway from Brisbane to
Sydney, it possesses groat advantages also in the
way of facilities of transit, as it commands inland
markets as well as those of Maitland, Newcastle
and Sydney. Already a considerable portion of
the land has been secured by small farmers, and
an area of 350 acres has been purchased by the
Australian Chilling and Freezing Meat Company,
who are erecting thereon works which will add
greatly to the value of the surrounding property,
and form the centre of a busy industry in the
district. The same Company has also another
large block under offer. Ploughing and clearing
operations have been coffimenced on the land
which has been taken up, and it is to be sincerely
hoped that this is but the forerunner of very
many cases in which great and at present un-
reproductive blocks of land will, under good
management and by the aid of irrigation, carry
a large and thriving population of prosperous
yeomen. The enterprising and practical managing
directors of the Company, Messrs. Edwards,
Walker and Harris, take the widest interest in
the work of making its properties thoroughly
reproductive, and as soon as the authority in the
Bill now before Parliament has been granted,
steps will be taken to secure similar powers in
connection with other estates. The Company is
certainly deserving of every success in its efforts
to introduce a system which should revolutionise
the future progress of the colony, and multiply
its resources and population.
The Ballarat Gas Company is content to
reduce the rate after paying a modest dividend of
7h per cent.
Maoriland, N.S. Wales, and Tasmania
supply, in the order named, the “Grand Old
Men ” of the Federation Convention, who may bo
thus tallied off—Sir George Grey, 79 years old ;
Sir Henry Parkes and Adye Douglas, nearly 7b
years. Parkes is four days older in “time ” than
Douglas, and a century or two more ancient in
“no savee.” After the septuagenarians limp at a
big distance Henry Cuthbort and Nick Fitz-
gerald, of Victoria, both 62 years. All the
Premiers of Australia are among the dele-
gates, but Maoriland’s chief Minister is absent.
Sir EL Parkes is the oldest Premier, and Sir S.
Griffith, of Queensland, the youngest, the
latter being 40 years old. The others
range—J. Munro (Vic.), 59; P. O. Fysh
(Tas.), 56; and T. Playford (S.A.), 51. John
Forrest's exact ago has not been disclosed, but it
is somewhere in the “roaring forties.” The
youngest delegate is Alfred Deakin (Vie.), who is
but 35, about one-fifth of which he has put in as a
Minister. Parkes ties John Downer for the ugli-
ness championship, and runs a dead-heat with his
colleague Toby Barton as to biggest size in hats.
Honest Tom Playford, of Adelaide, distances all
the others in largeness of boots, Colonel Smith,
of Ballarat, a near second. “ ChafFey ” Baker, of
Adelaide, ties John Donaldson, of Queensland,
for best-looking honours, which is meagre praise
at best. “ Oratorical ” Rutledge, of Queensland,
is the most pious; Munro, of Victoria, the most
intemperate teetotaller ; and the best capacity for
whisky is enjoyed by—well, a certain small man can
besafely backed to put under the table any one of the
remaining 44. There are, among the 45 delegates.
16 Australian-born members, thus made up—s
natives of N.S. W., 4 of South Australia, 3 of Tas-
mania, and 2 apiece of Victoria and West Aus-
tralia. Of the others, 12 were born in England,
8 in Ireland, 6 in Scotland, 1 in Wales, 1 in the
Isle of Man, and 1 in Lisbon (Sir George Grey).
The biggest man in the Convention is a Corn-
stalk (J. P. Abbott) and the shortest in stature,
though not in rotundity a Crow-eater Sir
John Bray. The introduction of flogging in
Victoria is represented by “ RigUeous” Wrixon,
who sits against the express wishes of the
present Premier of that province, and re-
presents the dead and buried Coalition of last
year. Among the delegates are 18 lawyers of
various sorts ; 8 squatters or quasi-squatters ; 6
representatives of mixed commerce ; 2 auctioneers
and land-sharks pure and simple ; 2 pressmen; 2
miners ; 2 civil engineers ; 2 old army men and 1
‘naval officer; 2 ex-parsons ; 1 each—farmer,
doctor, grocer, sawmiller, and surveyor; and 2
who can be called nothing but professional politi-
cians (Parkes and Lee Steere). In tiro category
of avocations, some members are counted more
than once ; thus, Rutledge counts both as an ex-
parson and as a lawyer; and Sir Thos. Mblwraith
as a civil engineer and a squatter. Duncan Gillies
is the confirmed bachelor of the Convention.
UNIMPEACHABLE TESTIMONY.
Eaots are established by testimony. This is so,
not only in laws of business and right, but also in
social life. But while the importance Pf evidence
is thus everywhere acknowledged, its weight is
purely dependent upon the character of the
witnesses. Unimpeachable testimony is therefore
what is wanted; Upon this principle the follow-
ing names are presented to the public as being
those of parties who, having experienced or
observed the effects of the great German remedy,
St. Jacobs oil, accord it their hearty endorse-
ments :
The Right Rev. Bishop Gilmour, Cleveland,
Ohio: “ Excellent for rheumatism and kin-
dred diseases. It has benefited me greatly.”
lion. Ed. Salomon, Ex-Gov. Washington Ter.,
San Francisco, Cal.; “My cure of severe
rheumatism and lameness by St. Jacob’s oil
was instantaneous.”
Prof. Tice, the renowned meteorologist, St.
Louis, Mo. ; “ Almost instant relief from
excruciating pain.”
Mine. Marie S.dvotti, Prima Donna Wilhelmj
Concert Troupe: “Nothing, can coir pare
with it as a prompt and reliable cure for the
ailments named.”
Win. H. Wareing, Esq., Asst. Gcnh Supt.
Third .Division Mailing and Distributing
Dept. New York Post-office : “ Proved
equal to all that is claimed for the oil, and
found efficacious. Ready relief for rheu-
matic complaints.”
Hon. Thomas L. James, Postmaster, New
York : “ Referring to Siipt. Warning’s
report, concerning St. Jacobi oil, ‘I con-
cur.’ ”
Professor C. 0. Duplessis, Manager Chicago,
111., Gymnasium : “Our professionals and
amateurs use it in preference to everything
wo know of or have ever tried.”
Geo. W. Walling, Esq., Supt. Police, New
York City : “ Members of this Dept,
relieved of Rheumatism by its use.”
Hon. Leonard Swett, the Great Lawyer of the
North-west, Chicago, 111. : “Certainly the
best remedy of the kind I have ever known.”
Capt. Paul Boyton, the World-renowned Swim-
mer : “I do not see how I could get along
without St. Jacobs oil. ”
M. V. B. Hersoin, Esq. (Pinkham and Hersom),
Boston, Mass. - “After spending vainly
five hundred dollars for other remedies, I
have no hesitation in declaring that St.
Jacobs oil will cure neuralgia.”
Stacey Hill, Esq., Mfc. Auburn Inclined Plane
Railway, Cincinnati, Ohio : “Undoubtedly
it is a remarkable medicine.”
WATERBURY WATCHES at the
WORLD’S FAIR.
IN THE ENEMY’S CAMP.
Mr. D. Young 1 , of London, who is manager of
the Waterbury Watch Co.’s exhibit, informed me
that ho is telling on an average 500 Watches a
day in the industrial section of the Children's
i’alace, where the Waterbury is also on display;
and I was informed at the Waterbury- head-
quarters, in the Rue Montmartre, where a store
for the sale of Waterbury Watches exclusively
lias been open for some time, that the watch is
much liked by the French people, and the sales
are rapidly increasing.— Chameerlynk, in the
Manufacturing Jewel lek.
NOTE.—The local agents of the Waterbury
Watch Co. desire to draw the attention of would-
be purchasers of genuine Waterbury watches to
the fact that the word “Waterbury” in small
letters, and also the interwoven letters “W. W.
C 0.,” appear upon the dial face of every watch
manufactured by the abovenamed company. This
caution is, unfortuna ely, rendered necessary from
the fact that it has come under notice that numer-
ous persons have (much to their disgust) been
deceived hit) buying watches as Waterburys,
which were no more Waterbury watches than the
moon is green cheese. The agents of the company
will be glad to have any future cases of such im-
position promptly brought under their notice,

England in 1891.
A. London paper thus discourses on “The Bright
New Year”:—
The country at large was perhaps never in worse plight
than it is to-day. Proofs gather hourly that agriculture
in England is slowly decaying, and that with its fall the
labourers wages (when he gets any) are equally narrow-
mg to absolute starvation figures. Villages that 20 years
ago were prosperous, and whose shopkeepers were well-
to-do, are now deserted or being deserted ; one little
st ° r ? V^ es for those who are left > and a glance at the
omcial Gazette would show that even the keeper of that
store is working with goods obtained on credit and with
property covered by bill of sale. The fanner cannot
grow wheat to compete with America or India, and (lie
course of his education has been such that he does not
understand that he might, at any rate, keep his head
above water if he only knew how to raise hogs, butter, or
poultry. His mental vision embraces the Hall and the
Ghuich, and that is all. They did for his father and they
are good enough for him. If he has to bankrupt and the
squire or the parson seizes every chattel he possesses-
Well, it is the will of God ” and nothing can prevent it.
The silly ass neglects to think that when he was a boy
wheat was 00s. a quarter as against half that figure now—
that land worth 30s. an acre per annum then is worth
much less than 15s. now, although he still pays the 30s.
His only book is his Bible, and he ignores farming litera-
ture altogether; Slowly the land is reverting to ils
owner, who himself cannot work it from want of capital
Or knowledge. The land-hunger from which his ancestors
suffered so much, and which has resulted in the possession
of what he would now like almost to give away, drags i.im

Spruce servants has now only a slatternly brace or so, and
the stables hold but a pony; The shooting or fishing is

want food for their families. Tney don’t mind working
for it, but they must have food. 1891, any night we like,
say 12 o’clock, with a thermometer at 29 below freezing

The late William M‘Kinley, law-reporter
for the Melbourne Argus, once was told by a then
junior barrister that he (the J. 8.) despaired of
making a living in Melbourne, and_ intended to
try the country. “Your chance is certain to
come; don’t ruin your career by going into the
country,” advised M’Kinley. The young bar-

for the first time how much he had lost in quitting

that the Duchess of Marlborough in future will
have to maintain her position Oh £16,000 a year
instead of the £26,000 she declares indispensable.
Which reminds us of a Mrs. C—a N.S.W.
woman who not long ago went “home.” “ When
he went to England before,” she said to a friend,
“he had only £40,090 a year, and we found our-
selves cramped for money at times, but now we
have £60,000 a year and shall be able to live quite
comfortably.”
MR. WM. ALEX. SMITH, F.S.S.
Secretary of the Citizens’ Life Assurance Company.
Young Earl Dudley, it is said, is to marry
Maud, second daughter of the Prince of Wales.
The family history of the Guelphs is sufficiently
scrofulous, and the world is not unaware that
Earl Dudley is the son of a father whose leading
delusions were that he was about to add to the
population of the world, and who used to make a
nest under the impression that he was hatching
eggs. The Bulletin prays that the blessing of
Heaven may continue to rest on the young couple
who start life under such favourable auspices.
Sir Edward Clarke, the English Solicitor-
General, is a self-made man of the Good-Stories-
for-Little-Boys pattern. The sole joy of his
mother —and she was a widow, &c. —little Edward
used to say, “ Mother, when I’m a big boy I shall
study for the law,” and then he would kneel at
her feet, and fold his little hands together and
pray, “ 0, Lord, let me sit on the Woolsack before
I die.” And it begins to look as though the Lord
means to let him. Clark is a clever lawyer, and
one of the political fathers of “ Conservative
working-men.”
M‘Donald, ex-crier, DO years in Mel-
bourne Supreme Conrt, is in ter viewable, on his
afternoon stroll. He thinks the generation of
Purves, Madden, Topp, Isaacs, and Co. im-
measurably inferior to that of Follows, Ireland,
Sewell, Michie, Dawson, Aspinall, and Billing,
Mac’s old associate was Lowry, and a young
reporter went up for the first time to the sessions,
when he Was on duty. He took Lowry for the
prisoner, up for stealing a watch, and wrote a
pathetic description of an elderly nan of most
respectable exterior, clad in rusty black, with a
white tie.
Says “America” :
A convict named Muir, from Glasgow, who is the
original of Marcus Clarke’s “ Barrington, the Prince of
Pickpockets,” was the author of the celebrated phrase :
“ We left our country for our country’s good.”
This is a garbled quotation from a description in
London Athen.uum of Marcus Clarke’s prose
writings. Muir, of Glasgow, a gentleman of
standing, was one of a party of Scotch political
martyrs, whose sufferings and adventures are as
omantic as anything ever told in a novel, while
Barrington, the alleged author of the famous pro-
logue and quoted line, was simply a clever
scoundrel of whose existence even Muir probably
was unaware. Muir was a really noble man.
Bishop Kennion, of Adelaide, asks the Pre-
sident of the Wesleyan Conference to excuse him
from taking part in the Wesleyan centenary cele-
brations, on the ground that he would be com-
pelled to express his conviction that modern
Wesleyanism has departed very widely from the
position taken up by John Wesley, and that “ he
would not willingly go out of his way to say a
word to hurt the feelings of his brother Chris-
tians ” •
He wound “ brother Christians? ” Kind Heaven
forbid it !
Yet, saying he’d never insult ’em— he did it!
Rank folly in honesty’s nothing to credit,
Avowing we never would say it— ive’ve said it!
Wrote Oswald Keating©, “D.D.,” who
died last week at Darlinghurst prison under such
tragic circumstances, in a recent article in the
Sydney Quarterly Magazine “In this age
money is the great God of the world. Money
will make wrong right, crime virtue, black white,
and the worse appear the better reason.” True ;
and the application of the apothegm to Keat-
■inge himself lay in this: that had he been pos-
sessed of enough money and little enough vanity
to have been defended by an acute barrister,
instead of standing up in Court to defend, or
rather to Convict himself, no jury could possibly
have found him guilty on the evidence submitted.
Logically regarded, it was a very strong case of sus-
picion, and nothing more. It was not good
enough to hang a dog upon.
Old proprietor W , of the C J
newspaper, lately summoned his editor to the
proprietorial sanctum:—“Mr. S , I have no
complaint to make of the articles you supply,
which are good enough. But sometimes, when
you have taken too much drink, you make use of
such frightful language that I am really afraid of
retaining you in my employ for fear you might be
the means of losing me my character.” Ed. :
“Then, in case your apprehension should be
realised, you should consider me your friend.”
W : “What do you mean?” Editor (beginning
to take his coat off): “Mean? Why, that you
have the character of being the meanest ill
the town, and shquld I be the means of losing yoll
that character, you ought to consider me the best
(adjective) friend you ever had.”
David Syme at one time—long before he
became a howling Imperialist and said Australia
would have to help England in keeping Russia
out of India—determined on dropping in the
Melbourne Age all recognition of “colonial”
military titles when dealing with subjects in
mufti, so to speak. Thus, volunteer - Major
Cheesemould would become, in the report of a
purely civil function, plain Mister Cheesemould
and Captain de Wellington Boots would be sim-
ply Mr. Boots, and so on. This plan, however,
elicited the disapprobation of no less a military
amateur than the great Colonel S , of big-
buots notoriety, and he remonstrated with David
about not being paraded in print with his military
title. “ But what’s your objection, Mister
H——asked David, dulcetly, “ to being called
‘Mister?’ What’s your object in wanting an
honorary colonial shoddyism flung at you every
time?” “Well, you see,” said the Colonel,
“ there are so many S s that if people get into
the habit of dropping the ‘ Colonel ’ everybody
will be calling me ‘W. C. S “ Well?’'
queried Syme. “Well !” replied the Colonel.

Mrs. Spencer, the oldest colonist of

The lectures and speeches of that charming

The high-water mark of extravagance at
the Amphitryon Club, London, where they sell

respondent of a Melbourne paper, was not reached

ley gave a “short” dinner to four friends, for
which the bill was £9B odd.

We are informed by a correspondent that
there was no rowdyism or disorder at Clermont (Q.)
when the “ blacklegs ” arrived, only a desire on
the part of the unionists to have an opportunity
of dissuading the arrivals from fighting the battle

editor of the local paper, refused the use of the
Corporation boat to convey supplies to the Union
Camp. ,

It is cabled that a petition has been made
for the removal from the English Bench of Justice
Sir James Eitzjames Stephen on the ground of
insanity. He was very hard-headed when he
tried Mrs. Maybrick lately. He is famed for his
heterodoxy, and his book on “ Liberty, Equality,
and Fraternity,” while as a lawyer his feat was
going to India and emulating Macaulay's work, in
codifying. Hard-headed and red-headed, one
somehow seems to want evidence.

“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin ”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government*
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is hot
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains>
and has become a vast property, because it pbs.
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes*
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and coill-
mercial success can at Once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success Was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent spine
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the oidy well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
ThE Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper-
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

Victorian Racing.
With fine weather and the promise of good sport
in their favour tfie V.R.O. people had to lament a distinct
falling in Saturday’s attendance at Flemington. Some
previous Newmarkets have drawn a bigger crowd and ex-
cited far more speculation at the post, the scarcity of the
better sort of local punters—the steady-going individuals
who have a pound or two bn every race at big meetings,
but are never seen “following the sport” at small ones—
being a significant sign of the times. It is something
more than dullness of trade front which the absentees are
suffering. They have been dropping their money per-
sistently for a long time, and just now they are swearing
off racing. The last Melbourne Cup-week, in spite of
Carbine’s win, wAs a real bad time for the majority of com-
htercial punters, who “ went down ” on the minor handi-
caps, as they always do when N.S.W. horses or any horses
not trained and touted within five miles of Melbourne,
are getting more than a fair share of the good things. So
it happened that neither the bookmakers in the paddock,
nor the nobler animals in the Birdcage were furiously
mobbed on Bungebah’s day.
* # #
No shout of joy rent the air as the big horse
lobbed in all by himself. In Victoria he was first favourite
only in a professional way of speaking, for the general
public didn’t get wind of the “dead bird ” until his price
was too short to tempt them. Most of the local trainers,
jockeys, and representative knowing ones backed Bunge-
bah for a bit, but nine-tenths of the ring-money was
scooped by a small Sydney crowd. There were four other
betting races (Carbine’s canter not counting), and as they
all went to N.S.W. horses, the Melbourne victims of their
home-bred fancies returned home in a pensive mood. In
truth, winners want too much finding since James White
died, and the outside public are growing weary of trying
to pick ’em in the dark.
# * *
Before the Leger was run Gibraltar looked like
the horse that couldn’t win, consequently, it is hardly
fair to sneer at the touts who had arrived at one wrong
conclusion on the subject.
* # *
The A. J.C, Derby winner was certainly not as
hard in appearance as The Admiral, Enuc, and others,
but, being healthy enough inside, his extra pluck and
length of stride brought him home. Gibraltar, probably,
is the only game animal Of the lot (barring Correze, who
seemed tucked up and overdone), but as fine condition is
absolutely essential in a 21-mile race, it seems very im-
probable—writing before the event —that he can win the
Australian Cup. If Enuc, with only 7st. Mb. to cany,
hasn’t, by the time this appears in print, beaten all the
other Leger horses his failure can be put down to a con-
trary spirit. The Ballarat colt could have finished pretty
close to Gibraltar and Admiral on Saturday but for Power
easing him. Yet he seemed more glad of the excuse to
“ turn it up” than any real four-legged gentleman ought
to be.
The Federation Convention banquet—
whoo-whoop ! Try Marshall’s Tonic Nervine.
Premier Munro has alluded to Duncan
Gillies as his “ noble predecessor.” Rise, Sir
Duncan, elder sunken.
“ A country must be an exalted one that
pays a beast and a coward £6 a week to go run-
ning about seducing young girls and blackening

They did not let Dan O’Connor “spake ”
at the Federation banquet. They only allowed
him to say “Hear, hear,” which he did all the
time.
Lord Jersey : —“ Let history teach a
nobler lesson to mankind, and show how the bonds
of union can be drawn closer, and show that the
history of the old world shall never be repeated
here.” Hear, hear. No more Earls, no more
Monarchs.
When the Federation banqueters , had
drunk the special toast—“ One People, One
Destiny”—the band played “Rule Britannia.”
And fittingly so. “One People, One Destiny,”
as’ thus musically interpreted, is the Imperial
Federationist motto.
Paderewski, the great Polish pianist, comes to Aus-
tralia. The only successor of Liszt in dashing play ; a
marvel as an executant.

“We desire no alteration from the happy
conditions of Australian life,” said Banquet-Presi.
dent Parkes. Who are “we”? Ask the labour-
unions of Sydney and Melbourne and Adelaide ;
enquire of the shearers of Queensland, and the
miners of Charters Towers, Newcastle, Bulli and
Broken Hill; question the seamen of Australia
and Maoriland ; poll the farmers and bushmen all
over the continent; and then report the answer.
Parkes declared at “the banquet” that
Australia’s ambition is (we quote the S.M.
Herald verbatim report.) “to remain side by
side with that dear old England we all love so
well .... to share all her difficulties, and
honours, and glories, and to be equal in every-
thing beneath the sway of the British Crown,
and under the beneficent rule of our Sovereign
Lady the Queen.” Yet this is the Parkes who
made Australian nationalistic political capital out
of his opposition to the despatch of the Soudan
contingent ! .
The accomplishment of Australian Federa,-
tion, unless a sudden outside danger should
menace us, which is an event most unlikely, to
happen except as a result of British pigheaded-
ness, will be a tortoise movement. It will be
lucky, indeed, if it be as sure as it will be slow.
Contrastingly, the after proclamation of an Aus-
tralian Republic, which is a certainty of the
future, will probably be a sudden and violent act.
Whatever resolutions the sitting Convention
adopts, its work can only be preliminary. It has
to be submitted first to each Australian Parliament,
and next, as Premier Playford has publicly
stated, to the public vote. If Australian Federation
is made the test-question of Parliamentary elec-
tions under the present electoral systems, the
sneak-plotters and Imperialists, by the agency
of their own particular infernal machine —
plurality of votes —will continue to debauch the
country, and will attempt to sell their adopted
land, bound hand and foot, into perpetual
liegedom.to a foreign crown. The principle of
One-Man-One-Vote should be statutorily intro-
duced in every province before its people are
asked to return or reject can didates on the Federa-
tion question ; or, this plain and only issue should
be decided by a plebiscite of the people, whose
personal vote should decide the result.
After fitting Victoria Regina with wings
and a halo. Premier Parkes, at Monday night’s
banquet, proceeded to butter Governor Jersey by
repeating ’Opetoun’s self-adulatory and chuckle-
headed remark about “a new departure in Gover-
nors.” “ The new Governors are a very different
set of people to the old lot of governors,”, echoes
Parkes. How, and why ? They have more money
perhaps, and they certainly have “higher” titles,
yet is Jersey or Carington a better or more dis-
tinguished man than, (say) Sir John Young, or
Sir Hercules Robinson? Is Lord Onslow, as a
man, an improvement on Sir George .Grey ?
“Greatness ” is Parkesianly estimated by Imperial
titles.
Capable judges are unanimously of opinion
that the Convention banquet oratory was utterly
unworthy of what was intended to be a great
occasion. The keynote of the whole dispiriting
performance was “ God Save the Queen,” and the
living inner fires of Australian N ationalism were
carefully banked under the dust of artful
generalities. The regiment of newspaper re-
porters to whose lot it fell to record the lip-drop-
pings of the after-dinner orators when asked to
give their candid private opinions of the proceed-
ings, almost unanimously voted the speeches flat
and inconsequent. Parkes was trickily earnest on
puerile points, but his language was cold and weak
and evasive—diluted and elusive—whenever it
pretended to touch the important subject that
forms the ostensible cause of the Convention. The
other speakers faithfully rivalled Parkes in
mediocrity. The shadows of the evening’s oratory
were traced in deepest indigo. Amid the mono-
tonous drivel, a commonplace platitude seemed a
sparkling crystal of inspired polish.
Set a bank-manager to catch a bank-
manager.
Premier Munro (at the Imperial Federa-
tion gorge) would “ not have faith in the existence
of a Supreme Being if we did not believe we were
sent here (to Australia) for a great purpose.”
Just so. Then Munro can excuse a blaekfellow
who disbelieves in God’s existence, seeing that
the argument flattens out the black man alto-
gether. And Munro wouldn’t have faith in build-
ing-societies if he had been one of the Premier
Permanent’s insolvent victims. Or in land-booms
if he wasn’t a boomer himself. Or in Parkes, if
he was a real Australian Nationalist, instead of a
canting Scotch pedlar.
Parkes, in concluding his response to the
toast of his health at the Imperial Federation
banquet, said that if he could help in bringing
about a United Australia, “ he would care for
nothing else!” Great is the power of humbug
to deceive .the listening masses—if people only
took Parkes at his own valuation they would
swallow his peroration' as gospel. Yet the same
speaker had, within the previous two hours, in the
course of several speeches, devoted all his oratorical
powers to the ignoble task of prostrating Australia
afresh at the foot of an old-world throne, and
renouncing, in the name of a half-awakened
nation, all present hopes of national inde-
pendence, besides beslavering the distant monarch
with the most fulsome personal flatteries, as if
she were an evergreen stage fairy, or an ever-
young ballet-girl, instead of a commonplace,
stout, hard-fisted, well-preserved old woman
who loafs on the forbearance and misery of the
poorest populace in the world, and accepts the
grovel and the proceeds of the robberies of the
richest oppressors that ever |eized and held public
plunder. Parkes’ speeches were all swayed by one
dominant idea—the- sacrifice of Australia on the
altar of the Empire ; the placing of its neck once
and for all under the iron-shod boot of a foreign
monarch. The Old-Man-of-the-Sea would hand
Australia over in manacles to the Old-Woman-
over-the-Sea. But Parkes has failed to gauge'the
Republican instincts of the Australian democracy
—the inner soul of our people. He has said : “No
power on earth can throw back the cause of Aus-
tralian Federation.” If any power could throw it
back,' it is Parkes’ cool attempt to condemn Aus-
tralia to the hideous slavery of perpetual vas-
salage. No power on earth can prevent the ulti-
mate triumph of the cause of Australian Federa-
tion in one Independent Australian Republic.

turned spoons which were set out for the evening
meal.
Lottie Hazell was sitting on the bright steel
fender, stirring something in a little saucepan on
the fire, and hushing on her knee a frail white
child, two or three years old. In spite of its
obvious poverty, and a certain stuffiness which in
so imtny minds seems indissolubly associated iVith
comfort, the room was a cheerful one, and had a
pleasant, welcoming ait about it —an air not lost
on its master when, having stumbled up the ill-
lighted staircase, he opened the badly-hung dobr
of his home.
The boy—he could not have been more than ifi—
came in whistling gaily, kissed his wife, and sat
down in the ricketty Windsor chair opposite the
hearth. She looked up at him with reproach in
her eyes.
“ You’re late, Bill.”
“ Yes, old gal, I’ve had a queer day —an un-
common queer day. How’s the kid ?”
“ Poorly, very poorly. I took her round to the
dispensary to-night, and he says ‘ Beef-tea ?’ ”
Hazell bent his brows.
“ It’s all very well, as I told him-,” the wife wetit
on, “ but gravy beef’s not to be had for the ask-
ing-. Howsomevet, we must gO without some-
thing more ourselves. It seems like as if it was
all ‘going without-.’”
A deepet line between Bill’s brow's had by this
time crossed out tho eager and excited look with
which he had entered tire.room.
“ It’s damned bad luck. I say, old girl, don't
take on. It'll be all for the best. We shall pull
through somehow.”
She rose and stood facing him, the child in her
arms, its little bloodless hand hanging helplessly.
“'What do you mean, .Bill,” she said, “Some-
thing's up. What is it ? ”
He rubbed his head atid looked at her doubt-
fully.
“Now don't you [rut yourself about, Lottie-.
You’ll see it will be all right.”
“ God bless the man, what is it I ”
He tdse with a pbbr assumption bf Its being
iVothmg, went over to the shaky wash-hand stand
and dipped Iris head in the tib basin. His voice
came shaky through the splashing water, “ We’re
out on strike ! ”
11.
A misty, rainy morning in November. The
great paved space of Tower Hill was dotted over
with groups of men—twos and threes together
standing talking, discussing the future of the
great Dockers’ Strike. So far all had gotie well,
and private'privations seemed little iii the flush
of a great iithusiasm—little to men accustomed,
-week in, week out, to a life of privation. There
is something int’bxieatmg in the mere fact of being
banded together with one’s fe low-men for the
attainment of any common end—an intoxication
of which your mere individualist knows nothing.
The excitement of a great aim, something immea-
surably beyond the dull round of their work*a-
day lives—filled these men; and the talk among
the groups was hopeful, bright, enthus as tie.
Bill Hazell was among them—thinrier than a
fortnight before —but with a keener light in his
eyes. His voice was among the loudest raised in
discussion aird talk, and face bore on it most
strongly the seal of determination. His was the
loudest “ hurrah ” when the well-known straw-
hat of the leader of the strike was seen at last.
* * *
“He’s the man to pull a thing off,” Bill
s lid to his companion, as the leader appeared in
the road, which, running above Tower Hill, seems
a sort of vantage-ground or platform from which
one can speak to a crowd.
The leader pushed forward. A nod here, a
handshake there, a volume of prosiness cut short
and answered by a word—and he sprang on the
parapet and waved the straw-hat in answer to the
triumphant acclaim of the crowd. Then he began
his speech, his daily speech, from which the dock-
labourers learned What were the hopes of victory,
what the threats of defeat. What matter what
he said ? He knew how to speak straight from his
heart to the hearts of the men who heard him.
He checked, encouraged, reproved, stimulated,
passed on his own enthusiasm and faith, and,
abore all, he always looked like winning. He
told them what money had been sent by the
workers of other countries to help them in their
hour of need. He told them what he had done
and what other men had done on their behalf
since the previous day. He told them what would
be done by him and them that day to further the
cause they all had at heart. Then, amid ringing
Sheet's atid a fit© of enthusiasm that even k London
tain was powerless tb damp, the crowd dissolved;
dispersed, and, bannered and banded, the proces-
sion of t|ie penniless started on its daily march
through the richest city of the world.
Bill was of it: He held one of the cords bf a
banner, a position of responsibility that lightened
the fatigue bf his long hour’s march. The roads
were muddy with threb days’ rainfall; and boots
in the army of labour Are seldom nluch to boast of.
Even scarcely interested passers-by, glancing
casually at that procession with its firm step, its
ha gat'd, resolved faces, and the bra. e light in the
dockers’ eyes, said to themselves, “These men
nleau Winning, and they will win;”
Bill had no dinner that day, unless the slice Of
bread which his rear-rank man shared with him
can be called a dinner, and he was sick with
hunget as he olilbbed the stairs to the little room
which held hiS wife atid child.
lit.
As he entered the room his wife sprang to meet
him, and flung her arms round his neck.
, “ Thank God you’ve come home, Bill,”she said
hoarsely; “she’s worse.”
“ Who’s worse? The child,” he said, but not in
the tone of asking a question.
“ Yes —the child, our little girl as you said you
loved dearer than me.”
“ I only said it to tease you, my girl; ” he held
her with his arm-, and stroked her with a sort of
rough gentleness. “ Let’s have a look at the kid
- then a bit of supper. I’m wore out, Lottie, old
woman-. ”
She lighted the candle, and the father and
mother stood beside the bed where the child lay-
wasted and thin. Any doctor could have told
them that the child was weakly—could never
live to grow up, but doctors are not given to plain
speaking. To them it seem d that if the baby
could only be better fed, she might grow round
and rosy, like the children who placed on the
flags of the court outside —children of parents a
little higher in the social scale than a dock-
labourer, children energetic enough to “ play at
strikes” with an old tin tray and a few bits of
rag for flags. The two stood looking at the child.
Bill broke the silence in answer to something un-
spoken.
“Poor little kid! I can’t help it, Lottie ; I
can’t help it. I give you everything I get —x'dief-
tickets, grocery-tickets, and all. I can't help it.
What’s a chap to do ? ”
* * *
She turned on him almost fiercely.
“ Do? Why chuck up this cursed strike. Go
back to work. You’re sure of work now—and
better money.”
“ Go back to work,” he repeated slowly.
“ Look here,” she went on, “ look at our home.
It wasn’t much afore, but look at it now. Where’s
our sticks? Where’s our duds? Where’s every-
thing ? Gone t > pay for your holiday for you to
go processioning about all day long, while me and
the child may stay at home and starve for all you
care.”
Bill sat down on the edge of the bed.
“ You knock me all of a heap, Lottie,” he said,
“you do indeed. I told you what the strike
meant, and you raid—”
“ 1 don’t care what I said.”
“ But unless we stand by each other, as Burns
was saying to-day, the strike’s no good, and all
this goes for nothing.”
“ One won’t make any difference to them,” she
hotly answered, walking heavily across the room
and leaning her elbows on the mantel-piece.
“ But suppose everyone says that, tire strike
wou’d be over,” and he rubbed his rough chin with
his hand.
“Never mind what eVeryone says: What
you’ve got to think of is me and baby.”
“ Don’t I think ol yOU?” ho cried with sudden
violence, getting off the bed and beginning to walk
up and down the room. “God bless - and save the
woman ! What else do you suppose I think of
when tramping about rill day on an efnpty
stomach ? It’s fdr the sake of bur wives and kids
that we strike for better money ; Jack said So this
ttiorfling.”
“ H ang Jack !” Then she hesitated a moment;
and came across the roan t'd him.
* # *
{ ‘ Bill,” said she, “ have I Been a good wifb
to you, or haven’t I ?”
“ ’Course you have, old Woman, don’t take on sd
now.”
“ Then, Bill, I beg and pray yoti bn my knbes
tb drop this strike and go back to work and —save
our little girl. Oh, Bill, what does it matter
what you do? You ain’t everything to the strike;
but we , haven’t nothing but you—me and baby
haven’t.”
She had actually flung herself down on the floor
as she spoke. He stooped to lift her.
“No,” she cried wildly, “not till you say yes.
0, Bill, for God’s sake—there’s nothing left to
pawn—them grocery-tickets is no good for getting
her what she wants —say yes.”
He did raise her then and set her on the wooden
box that served as a chair.
“I Can’t, my girl,” he said; “I can’t go back
on my mates. It woilld be a damned dirty trick.
I can’t do it.”
There was a long silence, broken only by the
sound of a street-fight below.
Bill tried to return tb the commonp' ace*
“'Got any supper for me, old girl? I’m wore
out.”
“No,” said Lottie, bitterly, “ I have no supper
for you, nor for me neither; nor no breakfast nor
dinner. I sold the ticket for tuppence to get beef-
tea for baby, and I’ve had nothing all day.” Her
voice faltered her —-“Oh, Bill, I’m so hungry.
Won’t you go back to work? I could’borrow
threepence from the people downstairs this minute
if you’d promise.”
“My poor old woman,” he answered drearily,
“ I can’t do it. I couldn’t never look a mate
in the eye again. I can’t —not if we all starve
for it.”
“ May God forgive you, then ; I can’t.”
And at the bitter cry the child woke, w r ailing,
weakly and pitifully. The mothers arms were
round her in a moment.
“And she’s hungry again, now. My God,
what can I do ?”
IV.
“ End of strike. All men to return to work on
Monday morning. By order of the Council.”
That notice was posted up outside headquarters
on Saturday evening, but Bill Hazell did not see
it. He was with his wife, who sat on the straw
that served them for a bed, with a baby in her
arms. They fed the child with milk, but she took
little, and lay mostly sleeping in her mother’s
arms. When she was awake her mother sang to
her the gayest songs she could recall —sang them
with an unmanageable lump in her throat, an
unspeakable weight at her heart.

On Sunday morning Bill went out.
“ Bully finish, eh ?” said a mate who met hind
near Tower Hill.
“What?”
“ Strike’s Over; We’ve won. Last procession
starts at ten., You must be in it.”
Bill turned and ran back along the streets;
bright with the autumn sunshine. He wotild not
lose a moment ni telling Lottie the neivs. Ah !

coldly, without speaking.

An Idyll of the Plains.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Thk morning after an “a’coholically wet night”
is always a bad experience, even when fairly
good liquor has been consumed, and a bath,
and what is called “a morning,” will set you
nearly right. But the morning after a night of
bush-shanty rum and case-brandy—such brandy !
—of brands unknown in civilised parts, is an ex-
perience that is simply a foretaste of the orthodox
hell.
If hell consists of the veriest loathing of oneself,
of a confused memory of riding impossible races,
fighting impossible fights, and playing impossible
games of cards, accompanied by a wearied stiff-
ness and soreness all over the body, and a raging
thirst that only a lake or lagoon could satisfy;
then, one need scarcely die to experience it. So
dimly thought Tom Rawlings as he awoke from
a drunken stupor on the boarded verandah
of a remote bush pub. in the Far West,
where he had passed a few hours reposing
with his head on his saddle and still unstrapped
swag. He had only arrived the evening before, so
that as yet the poison had not had time to get
him thoroughly under control, and he was able to
sit up and try to think.
It was sunrise; for, in point of fact, the flies
had awakened him, and his first idea was naturally
to allay the thirst by which he was tormented.
Looking around, with an uncertain notion of where
he was, or how he had got there, he indistinctly
made out that not far off there was a water-bag
hanging from a rafter of the verandah, and by its
side, a pannikin.
This meant olysium, and Tom staggered to his
feet; made for the bag, and 1 failed, holding him-
self up by the verandah-post. He took the
pannikin and dipped it into the bag. It was
nearly a third full of water that had been
hanging there all night, deliciously cold.
He lifted the pannikin to his lips, but
the. first few mouthfuls seemed to pass
down his throat untasted. Then, as his
tongue and palate became slaked the coolness made
itself felt and he hastily gulped down the re-
mainder and dipped down for another supply, A
third followed, for real “outside” stingo rum
takes a deal of quenching, and then he paused
and had a look around.
The early morning is always beautiful in Aus-
tralia. There is perhaps only one place to which
its softness cannot lend a charm, and that is a
stony ridge in the interior, among the old-man
spinifex country. But, even in the depth of
summer in the laud of the great plains, or repel-
, lant sand-hills, the hour after dawn has a poetry
of its own thatlqnds a spell to the very desert.
Tom recognisecHtiothing of this, he was trying
to collect his scattered thoughts, and recall the
events of the past night.
His money !
He felt in his pouch and pockets. Empty, of
course, but that he had expected He had two or
, three cheques in his swag were they safe ? The
cold water had cleared his head, and after treating
himself to another half-pint he went over to his
saddle and examined the swag strapped on it.
That was .evidently untampered with —he knew
the holes he had pulled the straps to and his own
peciWiar trick of"tucking the ends in. Better to,
leave everything alone for the present until ho
had straightened himself up a little more.
Someone was moving in the bar and Tom went
in. The landlord, who never seemed to go to
sleep, was there, stooping behind the bar, pouring
something out of a wicker-covered jar into a stone-
ware keg. He rose up on Tom’s entrance, with
rather a red face.
“Ullo, Tom ! you up already, old man ?”
His tone was kindly, so that Tom instinctively '
knew his cheques were safe as yet.
“Yes. What the deuce did you let me sleep on
the verandah for? I’m as stiff as a horse.”
“Let you sleep there! How could I help it
when you would sleep there, spite of anything I
could do?”
“Well, show us a room now,” said Tom.
The landlord bustled round the bar. Tom had
just finished a large fencing-contract on a station
fifty miles to the westward, and was pretty sure
to have a big cheque on him.
Mine host of the Halfway Inn prided himself
on being a severely honest man, who always gave
his customers what he considered full value for
their money. He never stuck up drinks that a
man had not called for; but then, if a man was so
drunk that he kept on calling for drinks without
partaking of them, why, that was only fair busi-
ness. And down they went.
Tom went out to the verandah and carried his
saddle and other impedimenta into the rude bed-
room assigned him. The landlord was too wily
to press him to drink ; he knew that a man on the
first morning is full of good resolutions, and would
sternly reject such overtures. He bided his time.
Tom sluiced bis face and head, and as he dried
himself he looked out of the window. Not far
away was the rough horse and cow yard, and a
small black boy, clothed only in a shirt, below
which his legs appeared like two thin black
sticks, was putting the three milkers in. A
young woman with buckets in her hands stood by,
waiting for the slow-moving beasts to step over
the sliprails. ,
Tom suddenly thought of a drop of fresh milk,
mainly, it must be confessed, in connection with
rum. He knew who the girl was—an orphan
niece of the landlord, who had lately come to live
at the place.
Tom went to the bar, got a large glass, and in
it some so-called rum, and strolled across to the
yard.
By this time one of the milky mothers had been
bailed up, and the girl, with her head down, was
busy at her task. She did not look up for some
time, and then coloured a little at seeing Tom
watching her. She was a comely, fresh-coloured
girl from the uplands of Naneroo, and Tom
thought that it was the pleasantest woman’s face
he had seen for some time. But then he had
been living in the western back-blocks ’for many
years.
“ Did you want some milk?” she stammered.
It is always the woman who finds her tongue first.
“ If you please,” said Tom in his best manner.
She took a pannikin from the empty bucket and
dipping it into the fresh, frothing milk, filled the
glass he held out.
As I said before, a real old fighting rum-thirst
takes a lot of quenching, and Tom drank off the
glass of milk without drawing breath. If the
cold water in the parly morning had been distilled
nectar, this was something doubly distilled.
Every 'Cobweb wad cleared from his brain, and
Tom felt as “ fit” as he had done four-and-twenty
hours previously, ‘ere he drew rein at the Half-
way Inn.
He stood. watching the girl at her work, the
fresh kine-like smell of the new milk bringing
back to him strange thoughts of his boyhood’s days
on the far-away Clarence.
As for her, the presence of a rather iowzled and
red-eyed bushman was not sufficiently a novelty
to make her feel bashful, but for some unaccount-
able reason she felt shy under his fixed regard.
Evidently he had “ been on the burst,” but then,
according to her limited experience, most bush-
men did go on the burst occasionally. He was a
fine, broad-shouldered, strong fellow —very strong,
she concluded —and she liked strong men.
By and bye old Snowy gave a vicious bang with
herxail, upon which he caught hold of it and held
it, Showing himself good-natured also. It is highly
disagreeable to get a bang in the face with a cow’s
tail when you are milking.
The country wooing of other lands has been the
theme of both poets and artists, but as yet the
loves of Australian Bush-lovers are unsung and
unpainted. True, the surroundings of Arcadia in
Australia are commonplace. Tennyson would
never have derived inspiration for that pretty
pastoral song of his that Queen Elizabeth is sup-
posed to hear the milkmaid singing :
Shame upon you, Robin,
Shame upon you now.
Kiss me, would you? with my hands
Milking the cow.
from such a scene as I am describing. But the
great and universal feeling is as strong in the salt
and blue bush country as it was in the days of
Queen Bess ; and when Tom, after waiting until
Hilly’s task was finished, carried the buckets up
for her, and she thanked him with another soft
flush, the magnetic spark of weal and woe had
been as surely kindled in the two, as if they had
been the veriest idlers in existence without a
thought beyond falling in love.
Tom’s attentions that day wore marked. To
this neither the uncle and aunt had any serious
objection, only the worst of it was that it inter-
fered with the more serious business of drinking.
Still they could make no remonstrance, Tom being
a man of his hands, and well liked in the district,
besides, there was always a chance of an outbreak,
and that bigeheque, which the landlord knew must
have a bod ily existence, and for which his soul hun-
gered and thirsted, might eventually come his
way.
Five days after Tom had had that drink of
now milk hi the cow-yard the fellows on Banjeban
station were surprised to see him riding up to the
place ho had left only a week before."
The usual snigger went round. “By jingo!
Tom didn't get far this time.”
“ Managed to stick to his horses, anyhow.”
“ Got a bottle in his shirt, I bet.”
“And 4 head,on him, too,” said another,
■ amidst a laugh.
But they were all wrong. Tom had neither a
“ head on him ” nor a bottle in his shirt. When
he got off his horse he looked ten per cent, better
than when he started, and a thrill of surprise
went through everybody.
Soon afterwards he sought an interview with
the manager. “ Have you let that bit of fencing
we were talking about, Mr. R - ?”
“ Not yet, Tom, you mean the short piece you
said it was not worth your while to take.”
‘4Well,” said Tom, “ITo changed my mind
and come back for it if you’ll give it me at the old
price.”
“Of course, but you’re not stone-broke yet,
Tom, are you?”
“ That doesn’t look like it. does it?” said Tom
grinning, as lie. produced the two cheques he had
received for former contracts. “ Will you look
those up for me, Mr. R. ?”
And now comes in the adventurous part, of
course. Milly is carried off by natives, such as only
exist in yellow-backed fiction, and is, of course,
rescued single-handed by Tom. Or a bush-fire,
such as never was lit in Australia, comes swooping
down, and as she is fainting before it Tom rushes
up on a coal-black steed and, with one herculean
grasp, lifts her on to the saddle and gallops away.
Nothing of the sort.
Tom quietly stuck to his contract, and when
the parson came round, rode over to the Halfway
Inn, and —of course he had arranged with Milly
beforehand-got married, and in process of time
shifted with his wife in‘o more settled regions and,
—I know no more. With matrimony ends the

DELCOMYN.
Cheerful item from London Truth ;
It is fortunate that murderers are not chemists, for
there are poisons known to every chemist which leave
absolutely no trace behind them. One there is—and
this, perhaps, was used in Italy and France when poisoned
gloves were the fashion—which only has to he put in the
water in which a person washes his hands for him either
to die or to go mad a few months later, Then again,
what bunglers murderers are in getting rid of a corpse, if
they prefer steel or a bullet to poison ! There is an acid
in which you only have to immerse a corpse for it to be
dissolved'in about an hour. The water is then poured
away, and not a trace or a vestige of the body remains.
Putting aside the criminality, the foolish way in which
people commit murders is a reflection on human intel-
ligence.
Why didn’t a lot of people we know drop into
that acid when they were very young? Also how
much of it would be required to swamp out the
Imperial Institute, and the N.S.W. Freetrade
party, and the Orange Lodge, and the Social
Purity Society—any news about an acid which is
strong enough to dissolve gimlets will be thank-
fully received at this office, and the whole body of
O.M.G.’s and K. O.M.G.’s and G.C.M.G.’s and
the country J.P., and the great bulgy, representa-
tive Australian, and the hangman—gallows in-
cluded, and the Harmy—drum included; and is
there any reduction on taking a quantity ? Also
we want some reliable information about the fluid
which causes insanity when people wash their
hands in it, and we will be glad to receive tenders
for washing about 00 politicians. 111 Foreign-
trade editors, 200 preachers who discourse on the
joys of poverty, and 18,7f-0 assorted grovellers—
not because we want them to go mad, but because
they are obviously mad already, and a strong
chemical might bring them round. And if it
didn’t bring them round they could afterwards be
dropped into the other compound for there is a
holy joy in the thought of a fluid that will swallow
up a whole pawnbroker so that he can be after-
wards gathered up in a jug or fired through a
hydrant. And to dream of one’s mother-in-law
and all his creditors flowing softly down into a
crystal stream somewhere, to babble over the
pebbles, and his aunt breaking slowly on the
shore, and his tailor' rolling in with a gentle
murmur on the yellow sands is pleasure unutter-
able, and then to steal out mysteriously on a dark
night, and empty the landlord into the sea with a
quart pot, and - so on.

sulphur incorporated with cream of tartar and other
curative ingredients. They are much more efficacious
than sulphur in milk or treacle. This has been proved
time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-
able.
Their Success.
“ FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS ” are the
latest and greatest British success. They have so much
merit as to always do good. They are so palatable and
agreeable that a child will take them with delight. They
are so safe that the weakest person may take them with-
out injury. They benefit every function of the body by
tonic action on the blood vessels.
This is what people ask us. We reply, because
those who write for the samples afterwards buv packets
of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS by post from
us, or obtain them from chemists, stores, or medicine
vendors. People likewise recommend and keep the
Tablets by them. The consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing. This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrimination, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would - be the case
that we were led to incur this risk.
Do I need tkem ?
If you have Rheumatism, Yes. They will kill the
decomposed and poisonous excess of uric acid in the blood
causing the disease,
If you have Constipation, Yes, They are a gentle,
safe, and a simple laxative, as suitable for children (in
smaller doses) as for adults.
If you have Hemorrhoids, Yes. They relieve the
congestion of venous blood at the affected parts, and
afford relief.
If you have Ulcers, Scrofula, Scurvy, or other
impurities of the blood, Yes. They neutralise the blood
poisons causing the diseases and expel them out of the
system.
If you have Skin Disease or Eruption, Yes. They
have a specific curative effect on all such, as they open
the pores from internally, and free them from obstruction
and disease taint. They likewise control where they do
not kill the disease principle from the blood, which causes
Eczema and other diseases.
Write a letter or post-card to the Australasian Depot, naming The Bulletin, and samples of FRAZER S SULPHUR TABLETS
will be sent you gratis and post free. They are for internal use for the Blood, Skin, Fevers, Complexion, Rheumatism, and Constipation. They
ward off Typhoid and all other infectious and contagious diseases. They are put up in packets, price in New South Wales, Is. 6d.; in Victoria,
Is. 9d. (postage 2d. per packet extra), of all chemists and storekeepers throughout Australasia.

ATEE’S PILLS are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-hccil-
aclio, dyspepsia, jaundice, and the common
derangements of stomach, liver, end bowels.
They break up cold;;, mitigate fevers, relievo
gout, rheumatism, and neuralgia, cleanse t!.o
system of malarial poison, and assist in the
formation of pure, rich blood. These well-
known pills are compounded of the essential
virtues of the best vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleter!-,
ous drug. They may, therefore, bo adminis-
tered in all cases where a purgative is needed,
without fear of ill olfccts. Being sugar-coated,
they are pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for an indefinite period
and in any climate. They should he in every
domestic medicine chest and traveller’s satchel.

Apropos to the Plumpton benefit “scan-
dal,’ the scandal lay in the giving of any perform-
ance for the honour and profit of a man who has
no perceptible claim upon the theatrical profes-
sion, and certainly no claim upon the public. A
few Melbourne people know Plumpton as a musi-
cian and head of a little society of mutual admira-
tionists, or as the compiler of a w eakopera. Musical
people know him in those capacities, while the
vulgar crowd know him as the recipient of virtuous
invectives from a certain Evangelist. The term
“ benefit,” in its theatrical sense, is degraded by
association with such an utterly undeserving case.

Lord Kintdre is accused of issuing an order
that all his servants are in future to be clean-

presuming that the order would have affected him,
that he became engaged before this order was

played no inconsiderable a part in the capture of

The book-fiend war goes merrily on all
over Australia. The proprietors of one or two
publications have been routed with great
slaughter, and thus lost their chances oi making
thousands of pounds, but so far the Pictokesque
Atlas Company of Ai stpai.asia has been uni-
formly successfully in all courts. 'It is estimated
that up to the present time no less than £14,000
law-costs has been spent by defendants in vain
endeavours to upset the company’s form of con-
tract. It is not generally known that the Atlas,
notwithstanding its huge collections, has not yet
by some scores of thousands of pounds returned
to its proprietors the full amount of their invest-
ment.
A wonderful story of the self-sacrifice and
martyrdom of a nine-year-old boy comes to us
from England. A tale of heroism, mistaken,
perhaps, but nobler and purer than that of all the
conquerors who ever 'sheath 1 .d bloody sword on
victorious battle-field. He was a country lad, one
of a numerous family. Father’s \vages were small,
even dry bread scarcely went round sometimes,
and the little fellow felt that the sixpence a week
he earned bird-scaring did not render him suffi-
ciently self-supporting to excuse his existence. So
one morning ho got up as visual to go to the-fields
and solemnly dividing his few possessions- a
knife, some ha’pence, and broken toys among his
brothers and sisters—kissed them all round and
trudged off to drown himself. But the pond was
shallow, and after repeated failures he walked a
couple of miles further to the railway-line, waited
till the express approached, then knelt down and
laid his little head on the cruel, cold rails, gravely
eyed his executioner as it approached, with
engineers and guards putting on brakes and shout-
ing like maniacs. and then—faded out of life be-
cause his little brothers and sisters were pinched
for bread in the world's wealthiest country;- What
a man the world has lost !
The best card-player Australia ever saw,
and one of the best, perhaps, the world ever saw,
was the Yankee who not many years ago “did”
all tltc “fly ” men this little island could produce.
He cleaned out Maoriland first, but said money
was not over plentiful there. Sydney panned out
better when, amongst other litt'e items, lie
trucked a well-known young grocer, who fancied
himself-at the game, for £500 over a game of poker,
and out Botany way one day lie completely
demoralised the pockets of a 14-stone butcher and
a six-foot-two amateur rowing-man, who thought
they were going to take him down. They accused
him of cheating, and wanted to fight, but he said
a little fellow like him (ho weighed about mile-
stone) would have no show at their style of fight-
ing—however, ho wouldn't mind setting-to
with them in Yankee style. Going out to
the kitchen, he returned with a couple of
carving-knives, and, throwing one down on the
table, said he was not particular who taclded him
first, but they did not see it in the same light, and
there was a big race between them to get out of
the room first. His largest coup, however, was in
Melbourne, when he fleeced a well-known Israelite
to the tune of £4030. When he went to Mel-
bourne a big bazaar was proceeding, and after
attending for a couple of days and going into raffles
and buying button-holes until he became known
to all the stall holders, he invited them to take
tea at his elegant suite of rooms. About 50 ladies
and gentlemen attended his first little reunion,
when champagne flowed like water. Now it hap-
pened that a couple of Hebrews were there who
suggested cards, and the Yank “guessed he
didn’t know much of the game, but he
wasn’t going to spoil fun.” Fairly large stakes
were played for, and the American lost his money-
with the greatest nonchalance ; indeed, in one
hand, when there was quite a pile of money on the
table, he threw down his cards j ust as a young lady
commenced a song, saying : “ I stand out, gentle-
men, and -leave you to it. I am too fond of music
to miss such a beautiful song.” The Hebrews
made quite a good thing that evening, and in a
day ortwo gambling Melbournefairlyrangwith the
fame of the heaven-sent Yankee millionaire all
ready to be shorn. He played his game pluckily,
and lost many hundreds the first night he was
invited out. He could do anything with a pack
of cards, short of making it talk, and he went
through all the Melbourne sharps like small peas
through a large sieve before they “ dropped ” to
his little game. On one cccasion a couple of
downy ones “rung in ” a pack of “readers,” but
they were of no avail, as he usually had half-a-
dozen of the pack on hand after the first deal.
He would run through his cards, exhibiting the
marks so that his opponents would think they
held him safe, and then place them on the table;
but somehow or other he would ring the changes
and beat them, perhaps, by a pip. After winning
a lot of money on this occasion he suddenly put
down his cards and called the waiter to bring him
a pot of paint and a small brush, handing him a
sovereign to purchase them, with. “What
colour ?” asked waiter. “ Oh, it doesn’t matter,”
drawled the Yankee, “ only these gentlemen have
played so long with these cards that they want re-
marking.”
FREETRADE OR PROTECTION.
Some vote Protection, some Freetrade,

AMERICA’S GREATEST STATESMAN
At one of the large dinners given at the seat of
government lately, the great orator said : “Permit
me, ladies and gentlemen, t j say that there is no
drink in the world so conducive to social inter-
course as the famous St. Louis Lager Beer. As
a mental and physical relaxative it has no equal.
It refreshes the body and exhilarates the mind.
It gently moves the blood to accelerated action,
and arouses the more generous sentiments that
cluster around the human heart. Its action in-
spires noble thoughts, and at the banquet table,
with intellect and genius, it touches chords of
inspiration that prompt to lofty efforts.”

SWORN CERTIFICATE.—Owe of Thousands more.
Noblo-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugfxmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, hut I became worse every day, roasting away' until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last j began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
yon told me you could cure me for a given sura. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
