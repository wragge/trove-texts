AYER’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair-
grower. When the capillary glands become en-
feebled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to tha
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair toils former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

WHO IS
WEAK
ƒ
■ Nervous k Debilitated
Who in his youth has trifled away his vigour of body,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor ST I N F.WAY'S success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts : —ist. That every case treated ,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded
from the purest, freshest, and refined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed
Voting and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
can recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free). Professor STINEWAY, who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you have taken, or
who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS.
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION :-Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do. you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting; fullness of blood in the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
trinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
sr other aches and pains ? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject ? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits ? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms ? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con ■
saltation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour?
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and f\, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter what your
complaint may be, call or write—l will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay !My vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-
TATIONS FREE. Medicines sent secure
from observation to any part of Australasia.

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.— Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.
“ History repeats itself,” and as surely as Sydney and
Melbourne have made lightning-like progress, so will

(REGISTERED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF NEW SOUTH WALES),
Late House Surgeon to tin* Great Northern Hospital, Caledonian Road, London,
SPECIALIST in the Treatment of Diseases of the
Reproductive Organs and Nervous .
Dh. PERRY was induced to publicly advertise himself as a
Specialist in this branch of the profession in. consequence of the number
of persons suffering from diseases of this nature remaining nnciued ; and
this is not surprising, when it is remembered, in consequence of the
general dislike of the profession to undertake these cases, the public
health has suffered, because the majority of persons advertising to treat
these diseases, and calling themselves Doctors, Professors, etc.,
Are Neither the One nor the Other,
and exist chiefly because DULY QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRAC-
TITIONERS have not occupied the field.
Patients can, therefore, readily see the advantage of being treated
by a practitioner who lias gone through a thorough Medical, Surgical and
Anatomical Training in the best hospitals ; and the Doctor argues that,
although it may be considered contrary to antiquated medical etiquette
to so advertise, yet he is promoting the usefulness and the dignity of
the profession more by searching out and relieving this class of disease,
than by leaving them severely alone to the care of nien who, however good
their intentions, have neither the opportunities or advantages of a regular
medical training to become acquainted with the best methods of treating
these complex forms of disease.

ZDr.
Will be happy to advise persons suffering from these
diseases, and as, in many cases,
Nothing but the observance of a few simple directions

the benefit of his advice and experience.

The “Wanderer” Watch
Has already established itself as a great favourite with all who
require a really serviceable timekeeper, and one that very little
attention is necessary to keep it in order. Unlike some of those
extensively-advertised Cheap Watches, which takes so long to
■wind and tick louder than a clock, the “Wanderer” takes
only eight seconds, and will then go for twenty-six hours. The
testimonials we have received from all parts of Australia fully
justifies us in recommending one of the best Watches at a
nominal price.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 23, 1890.
Trades-Unions and Constitutional
Methods.
The Trades and Labour Councils of the
■several Australian colonies are each the execu-
(ives of Labour in the provinces where they
operate. They can scarcely be regarded as
Labour Parliaments, because, unlike most
Parliaments, they do much work and
comparatively little talking. Their chief
functions are executive and diplomatic. They
conduct, on behalf of the people whom they
represent, negotiations. They make treaties.
In one particular they have assumed a func-
tion which in most constitutional monarchies
is an appendage of the monarchs. Being
purely democratic, they exercise sovereign
rights. They declare war and make peace.
Unrecognised by the actual constitutions of
the communities in which they flourish, they
are nevertheless political entities. It has
been only of late that their organisation has
been so matured and consolidated as to in-
vest them with the far-reaching influence
which they now wield and exert. But to-day
they constitute practically an unconstitutional
power operating independently of the organic
constitution, and in some degree in antagon-
ism to it. It is remarkable that these
Labour executives have in one very signifi-
cant particular- proved themselves more
effective than the recognised parliamentary
institutions. While the latter have been
making feeble and tentative attempts at
Intercolonial Federation, the Trades and
Labour Councils have practically effected a
federation of the Union Labour of Austra-
lasia, and have even overpassed that limit
by approximating to a federation with British
Labour organisations.
* # #
It requires no special endowment of pro-
phetic gifts to perceive that the Executive of
Labour must, sooner or later, in the exercise
of its authority, come into direct conflict
with the Parliamentary fcxecutives of the
different colonies. As matters stand there
exists a radical basis of antagonism. The
regular Executive is charged with the carry-
ing out, and is sworn to execute, the laws as
t hey stand. Now, the existing code of laws -
is crammed with enactments put upon the
•Statute-book in the direct interest of Capital
and Property. Even common law, which
derives its potentiality from no statute but
from ancient custom, comes to us from times
and conditions when the classes were every-
thing and the masses nothing. Indeed it is
not necessary to go far back to find a time
when the classes were less than nothing and
worse than nonentities. “That vile and
mischievous beast, the People,” was the
phrase -current in aristocratic circles when
the Netherlands were struggling to throw oft’
the yoke of Philip of Spain, husband of
M.vuv of England. .And although the ex-
pression is to-day muttered rather than
shouted or embodied in despatches, the
sentiment survives. The regular Parliament
is all that is respectable and sagacious. But
the Executive of Labour is disreputable
and dangerous, and if not checked and con-
trolled will prove infinitely “ vile and
mischievous.” Any ordinary reader of the
capitalist daily press will recognise this tone
pervading its articles.
* * »
No rational being now cherishes the delu-
sion that Labour can be definitely arrested
on its march towards wresting from Capital
a more equitable proportion of the product
of its exertion than has hitherto been doled
out do it, unless recourse be had to actual
physical violence and a bloody internecine
conflict. Of the two rival institutions, the
Labour Executive and the regular Parliament
—both being representative bodies—either
one must prevail or both must blend. All
organic governing bodies are based, in reality,
upon actual physical power. It may be
necessary to dig deep to arrive at the founda-
tions, but without physical strength there is
no real power in any institution, however
ancient it may be, however lofty and thick
its towers and battlements, and however
substantial its appearance. In New South
Wales, at this moment, 50,000 able-bodied
men, resolute in their purposes, look to the
Trades and Labour Council for guidance.
This is a mass too mighty for the police
to cope with, and even the handful of
military hirelings which, contrary to all
democratic principle, the State main-
tains, would be impotent to control such
a multitude. But there are over two
hundred and fifty thousand more adult males
in the colony whose inclinations and sym-
pathies cannot be accurately gauged, and
behind the police and the soldiers stands the
portentous shadow of the armed might of the
British Empire—the reserve forces of Law
and Order in Australia. In short, Labour
has nothing but calamity to expect should it
come into violent conflict with the authori-
ties. Should strikers overleap the existing
code of laws in any material particular,
Capital is entitled to invoke the intervention
of the Government, and the Government
would be faithless to its oaths of office were
it to refrain from “sending the Nordenfeldts
to Newcastle ” —from setting the machinery
of repression and punishment in motion.
It is not, therefore, only those hostile to
the claims of Labour w r ho appeal to them to
proceed with deliberation and caution, to
exercise a strong ’self-restraint, and to seek
for remedies for the evils they complain of
by constitutional methods. But the coun-
sellors of Labour are apt to smile with bitter
scorn when urged to have recourse to “con-
stitutional methods ” in order to achieve
their objects. They retort upon their ad-
visers that constitutional methods have been
tried and exhausted, and nothing has come
of them. Attempts to put forward distinctively
“ Labour ” candidates for parliamentary seats
have come to nought. The personal jealousies
among the leaders, and of the leaders by the
workers in general, have proved a formid-
able. and. indeed, an insuperable obstacle
at the outset. Moreover, Trades-unionists,
although collectively powerful, are in but few
constituencies sufficiently compacted to carry
in candidates of their own nomination. And
the ordinary politicians who are apt at court-
ing the union-vote at election time by vague
expressions of sympathy, and declarations of
good intentions, have almost without excep-
tion proved unstable. The very rottenest
of reeds have indeed been the working-man
candidates.. No sooner are these fairly
ushered within the portals of Parliament
than their very natures appear to undergo a
metamorphosis. They change exteriorly, *
interiorly—physically and mentally. They
affect chimney-pot hats and frock-coats.
They commence almost at once to ape
gentility, and concentrate their efforts upon
the object of emancipating, themselves for-
ever from the thraldom of wage-earning, in
order to enter the more comfortable ranks of
the tradesman or employer. They become
eminently “ respectable,” and are at pains to
emphasise their “ moderation.” Ordinarily
a labour-“ agitator ” sent into Parliament is
in most cases lost to the cause. This result
may be attributed principally to the inter-
mittent and accidental nature of the
influence exerted at elections by the
working-class. It is only by chance, and
under exceptional circumstances, that they
manage to shove in a man of their own
choice. Once in Parliament, such a man
quickly appreciates his situation. He feels
no assurance that those who got him in can
keep him in. He sets himself to so comport
himself as to secure his return by a general
vote instead of by a class vote. He has
learned how impotent the labour-vote really
is.
There is but one remedy 'for this im-
potence, and for its consequences. The
vote of the masses—which will be in practice
the labour-vote—must be a corded its full
value. At the present time the mere people
are deluded and fooled by a spurious “ man-
hood suffrage.” Every man has a vote, but
a particular class of men have seve al votes.
The population may be roughly divided into
two classes—the wage-earner, who has a vote,
and the property-holder, who has as many
votes as lie owns hundred-pound allotments
in different constituencies It is the hitter
who is so fond of inviting Labour to' seek
remedies for its grievances “ by constitutional
methods.” And when he proflbrs this advice
he puls his tongue in his cheek, knowing
that it is in his power, by virtue of his
property, to neutralise any effort Labour
may make to secure a Parliamentary repre-
sentative to its mind, or to keep out a
distinctly antagonistic candidate. It is
not too much to affirm that were every
one of the 50,000 trades-unionists in
New South Wales to record his vote at a
general election, every one of such votes
would be neutralised and cancelled by a
plural vote given by an allotment-holder.
This does not involve the existence of fifty
thousand separate owners of allotments.
Ten thousand men, each owning five allot-
ments in different electorates, are equal in
voting power to fifty thousand men possess-
ing but one vote each ! And when it is con-
sidered that there are men who possess
property votes in as many as thirty different
constituencies, it will be comprehended that
even five thousand men of the employer
class in the metropolis may be in a position
to counterbalance the direct political power
of all the Trades-unionists in the colony.
* * #
The very first step, therefore, which
Trades-unionists and its sympathisers should
take with the view of rendering it feasible
to accomplish their aims by “ constitutional
methods” should be to concentrate all their
political energies upon securing the passing
of a Bill to abolish plural voting. This is
the key of the position. As was pointed out
in these columns last week, the wage-earning
class in New South Wales numbers about
317,000. The actual number of electors
upon the existing rolls is not so many. It is
too late this year to attend to registration,
otherwise the first political duty of the
Trades and Labour Council would be to see
that every Trades Unionist had his name
entered upon the roll of some electorate.
Evidently there has been grievous laxity in
this particular. But, as matters stand, the
full influence of the I nions should be exerted
in pressing upon members of Parliament the
necessity for passing forthwith a Bill to limit
the electoral right to One Man One Vote.
Mr. W. H. Traill has already a measure to
effect this before the Legislative Assembly.
If nothing more comprehensive can be
secured, this Bill should be passed into law.
But it would be preferable that such pressure
be brought to bear upon the Government
that they should find it imperative to them-
selves to deal with the matter on a more
comprehensive scale. As a private member,
Mr. Traill has embodied as much as could
be judiciously attempted in his Bill. He has
admitted that the absence of any provision
for registration renders his Bill imperfect in
a sensible degree. But arrangements for
registration would involve a charge upon the
revenue, and a Bill containing clauses to that
effect could not be introduced except under
cover of a message from the Governor.
This could not be procured without
the acquiescence of his Excellency’s con-
stitutional advisers—the Ministry of the
day. The present Government has op-
posed to Mr. Traill’s Bill the most un-
compromising hostility, and they and their
supporters voted to throw it out on the
second reading. Their plea was that the
Government had itself- this session—
accepted the principle, and had embodied it
in a comprehensive new Electoral Bill, which
was promised in the Governor’s speech. But
the measure of their sincerity may be ascer-
tained by considering the fact that Mr.
M’Millan only last week declared that after
the Crown Rents Bill, the Coal Mining Bill,
the Public Works Bill; the Federation reso-
lutions and the Local Government Bill had
been dealt with, the Government would
bring down their financial proposals and
dissolve the Assembly. The full political
power of Labour should be concentrated
upon an effort so to influence mem-
bers on both sides of the House, but
especially upon the Government side,
that the Ministry should at once in-
troduce, not a complicated measure such
as they have in reserve —a bill to re-distribute
seats and introduce woman-suffrage, and
other complicated trouble and tomfoolery—
but a concise enactment to cancel plural
voting, to provide for registration and voting
tickets available wherever the elector chanced
to be at the time of an election, and t > apply
it to the existing rolls, so far at least as in-
validating non-residential votes is concerned.
Should the Government not frankly yield to
the instances which would be brought into
operation, then support should be trans-
ferred instantly to Mr. Traill’s Bill, which
is good as far as it goes, and is susceptible,
if well supported, of being made applicable
to the next general election.
# * *
It is essential that the Legislature should
be made truly representative of all classes
in their numerical proportion, in order that
the cause of Labour shall achieve substantial
advances. In every modern community the
few ride on the shoulders of the many and
pick the pockets of these beasts of burden.
The plunder thus gained is used to buy bits
and bridles to put in the jaws of the luckless
Common People. The vi ry wealth which is
accumulated by appropriating from the
multitude of toilers, week after week, a
proportion of their just dues, is, when in-
vested in landed property, converted into a
pretended title to votes, which are cast
against the parties plundered whenever they
endeavour, “by constitutional methods,” to
shake their riders oft’ their {shoulders,,, and to
wrench their hands out of their pockets. It is
by such devices only that a mere hand-
ful of exploiters are enabled to enthrall
a whole population. Holding, by such
tricks, control of the Legislature, they are in
a position to shape tire laws so as to consoli-
date their advantage, and to hire, with the
funds drawn by taxation from the general
public, policemen to club strikers into
docility, and soldiers to intimidate them by
menaces of massacre with Gatling-guns. By
an intelligent comprehension of the facts,
followed by a determined application of the
remedy, it should be quite possible to reverse
the conditions, and to make the workers the
constitutional controllers of the police and
directors of the Gatling-guns.
Labour and Capital.
In the present Australian conflict between
Labour and Capital, abundant evidence shows
that both combatants see into the future.
The light no longer centres on a named
amount of money to be paid for a given
amount of work or time spent in working.
The efforts of Labour to amalgamate the
forces of its various branches, and of Capital
to consolidate its resources, take front place.
The existing dispute between steamship-
owners and the officers in their service is not
absolutely or directly a dispute about wages,
but over the fact that the officers claim the
right of affiliating themselves as a branch of
Labour with the other branches governed
by a general Labour Council. Labour desires
to draw the officers into its fold, k no whig
that with them it will be one arm stronger ;
Capital desires to keep them aloof, with the
twofold purpose of depriving Labour of an
accession of strength, and of retaining in
isolation, and consequently in comparative
helplessness, those whom it employs.
* * *
In this and a number of other current dis-
putes the question of wages is practically set
aside. But a glance ahead will show that it
is only momentarily so. Fair wages for fair
work constitute the Asses’ Bridge of econo-
mics. Since the inception of Trades-unionism,
and probably since the first day on whicli
one man employed another, the problem of
what amount of money or its equivalent pays
in full for a certain amount of toil of hand
or brain, has received the intense attention
of at least the persons concerned ; but there
stands the Asses’ Bridge to-day, without
even an approach to a permanently success-
ful solution in view. Individual employers
who attempted to solve the question by
cutting down wages provoked retaliations
which proved that no solution was possible
in that direction, and individual trades whicli
attempted the' task by forcing wages up,
either w 7 on a little advantage, which but
whetted their appetites for more, or brought
down on themselves a defeat which made
bad worse. Un neither side was there the
revelation of a principle on which to rely.
The employer and the employed were equally
hungry. Each put in motion whatever
strength opportunities gave him to take from
the other, but with no explicit conception as
to where the ability to take was to be limited
by the right to take.
* * *
On this account the strikes of the past,
whichever way they went, are valueless as
contributions to a solution of the wages
question. They only show where the
strength of numbers won or the power of
gold won, and neither evolves the principle on
which to stake a sense of right. Inasmuch
as the general tendency has been in favour
of Labour, Democracy rejoices, but it does
so, not because it accepts the methods em-
ployed in the respective battles of the
various trades, but because, seeing behind it
generations of blind toilers who stumbled,
starved, to pauper graves, it is ready to hell)
Labour to put an end to its cycle of misery
by any means—even by the morally-worth-
less argument of numbers. The wages ques-
tion is, then, still there, and its obscuration
by that of affiliation is merely temporary.
Labour has although a winner of vic-
tories in some trades, been a loser of
battles in others, and, observing the
methods which won the victories, it desires
to apply these to the contests of the future.
A particular guild forced its employers to the
wall and wrested from them a surrender ; an
amalgamation of all guilds, one vast guild,
Labour personified, proposes now to do w r ith
all employers what successful guilds occasion-
ally succeeded in doing with some.
* * *
On the other hand, employers have Oeen
observant. They saw where they lost, they
saw where they won, and have not alone
profited by past experience, but have taken
in the plan of campaign now devised
by Labour. They not alone group
themselves together, but impede where
they can the affiliation of their economic
foes. This case of the steamship-owners
and their officers illustrates the latter
phase. In the eye of Labour every man
who gives up his weeks and his years to
do the work of another as that other directs
is as much a labourer as the man who builds
a wall or digs a ditch. His wearing better
clothes makes no difference. Whether ho
walks before the mast or behind the
mast matters not one jot. He gives the
work of his life for the pay of his employers,
and the permanent interests of his class lie
not with the capitalists, but with those
who also have to give up their lives for
pay. A writer in one of the daily papers
puts forward the plea that officers are,
or should be, “gentlemen,” and their
affiliation with the seamen they direct
or with labour societies generally would
detract from their digni.y and shorten the
arm of their authority. Possibly this would


. some cases result. But Labour has in its
I t^er years been confronted with prospects
greater calamities than these and has
assed on, and no disaster has occurred
P stay her absorption of a class of
ell because some of them wholly rely on
Adventitious circumstances to support “dig-
nity ”or wield authority. Steamship-owners
and other employers who try to impede the
arC h of events by considerations of dignity
And the exercise of a verbal authority are
doin'' worse than trying to stop the incoming
tide with a broom. Labour’s citadel stands
bold and high ; every man whose hands are
hard nr whose brain is tired with the work
AAf another sees that his post is there. To
that citadel he will go ; it is a mere question
f time. - And when Capital finds that tricks
of speech will not prevail, back to its citadel
it will rush with all its speed, and then the
battle of the world begins. #
The gold of the world will be on one s de,
the labour of the world on the other ; the
universal Trust against the universal
Boycott. And what will happen '! In the
exercise of its power of numbers Labour
will commit excesses which will excite
mutiny in its ranks, for among its soldiers
will be some who own capital; the Trust,
too, will develope mutinies, for much of the
rrold with which it wages war will be drawn
from the pockets of shareholders who are
poor. With mutinies on both sides, both
sides will be forced to pause. Then will
come the day for a new social philosophy or
for the practical application of the philosophy
0 f Co-operation at present so imperfectly
understood. It may—it will —be found that
work can never be adequately paid for by
wages, and that the only solution of that
Asses’ Bridge of economics will be, like the
Gordian knot’s, its final abolition. But the
conditions precedent must be that Capital
will have realised that human sinews and
human brains have more right to rule the
world than gold has, and that Labour will
have recognised that its share in the profits
of work is not to be wholly determined by
how much it can wrest from employers by
the mere strength of numbers in organisa-
tion. To this issue Capital and Lsoour now
quickly move.
Foreign Capital.
When the Australian rises to express his patri-
otic sentiments on some occasion of public re-
joicing, he seldom fails to congratulate himself
on the influx of foreign capital, and in the fact
that his country is being “ rapidly opened up.”
The opening up of the country is in particular a
cause of much happiness, and the term serves
as a pleasant disguise to the circumstance that
an immense area of public land has been sold
for a song to speculators who will afterwards
re-sell it to the people for ten times the original
price ; while the “ influx of foreign capital” is
an agreeable synonym for the fact that the re-
sources of this new country are being used up
to pay huge dividends to foreign stock-jobbers.
The report recently published that a London
jeweller has purchased 500,000 acres at Roebuck
Bay, Western Australia, seems to suggest that
this process of national development is taking
an unexpected spurt. It is true that no one,
except the jeweller himself (who lias never
set foot on Australian soil), is likely to be
any the better for this enterprise, and when
that gentleman cuts up his great estate
some years hence, and sells it at an exorbi-
tant rate to small settlers, and takes the
proceeds to England, and the settlers borrow
the means to pay for the property from some
British mercantile and financial syndicate doing
business in the province, and spend the best
years of their lives in a toilsome endeavour to
enable the syndicate to pay dividends—in
London—of 25 per cent., and are finally fore-
closed upon, one by one, and the land resold,
and the syndicate re-organised, there will be but
little in the way of actual prosperity to show
for all these exertions. Rut still there will
remain the blessed consciousness that the
country has been largely “ opened-up ” —like a
stuck-pig—and even when a territory wide
enough to form a small republic lias been sacri-
ficed for a trifle, and lias been repurchased a
dozen times over, only to remain after all in the
hands of some foreign pawnbroking institution,
nothing can deprive us of the joyous satisfac-
tion which attends the opening-up process in all
its branches.
♦ * *
The first business of capital is to multiply
itself by taking hold of any and every enter-
prise which promises a large profit, and the first
business of the profit thus obtained is to
re invest itself and keep on increasing. Conse-
quently, the “influx of foreign capital” means
that the foreign capitalist is exerting himself to
remove from this country to his own everything
that he can get possession of, and after the same
fashion the influx of the locust, the grasshopper,
and the potato-bug are equally matters of con-
gratulation. They all take everything' they can
seize, and then go. But the presence of the
foreign capitalist lends a certain air of fictitious
prosperity to the country. New cities are built
on land owned by a British syndicate and with
money borrowed from some other syndicate;
new mines arc opened up and their products are
sent away to gladden the soul of the British
speculator with expansive dividends ; and great
tracts of country are bought and sold and mort-
gaged and financed upon, and floated into com-
panies, and organised, and re-organised, and
liquidated, and subjected to various other
expensive processes, while the prosperity of the
country advances by giant strides, and the man
who only owned .til in the past now possesses
£lOO, and ow es £99 of i( to a syndicate which
will presently sell him up And meanwhile
this prosperity lightens the heart of the
Australian citizen, and when some new British
speculator buys up a whole province in order
that he may block the progress of settlement
for a number of years, and then swindle the
coming settler, and carry away the proceeds,
there is a general feeling that the country is
looking up, and that an era of unusual progress
is setting in. And if progress consists in a
desperate effort to sell on everything that can
he sold in the present, and not to care a darn
about the future, then the term is admirably
appropriate, and expresses the situation as
nothing else can. The existing condition of
things resembles nothing so much as the tem-
porary affluence of a man who has just sold his
oidy suit of clothes at a good figure, and remains
at home naked with the money. The joyous
disregard of all save the possibilities oi the
moment is about equal in either case.
* « *
The United States has enjoyed a large experi-
ence of the blessings of foreign capital, and the
Congress at Washington is now considering the
advisability of enacting that none save an
American citizen shall be qualified to possess
land within the territories of the Union. In
America, as in Australia, the British speculator
has been acquiring enormous estates which are
of no possible benefit to the nation while he
holds them, and which only serve to impoverish
the country when, through the labour of others,
he is enabled to sell them at an immense profit
and depart with the proceeds, and there is a
growing inclination to suppress absentee land-
lordism with a strong hand. The colony of
New Zealand is now practically owned by two
immense financial establishments, and what part
of the' country these two establishments have
not a lien over is hardly worth possessing.
They have both been intimately associated with
the progress of the nation —in other words,
they have helped to grow two blades of grass
where there was only one before, and they have
got a mortgage upon both of them. And
throughout Australia the number of similar
institutions is without number, yet seldom a
year passes without some new corporation of
absentee landlords appearing on the scene, and
where the British speculator is not his place is
generally taken by some “ representative Aus-
tralian,” whom the country supports that he
may be a tenth-rate spectre hunting for a cheap
decoration in England amid the general derision
of the miserable British peerage.
# * *
Nothing but the imposition of a ponderous
tax on all non-resident proprietors —on indi-
viduals and corporations alike —promises any
remedy for this tremendous evil. It is im-
possible to build a nation out of foreign capital,
or to construct a state out of syndicates and
financial agencies, and that species of progress
which consists in selling the resources of the
country to alien speculators, and leading a riotous
existence on the proceeds, is merely drawing
bills on futurity and trusting to Providence for
the result. What that result will be can readily
be imagined. Even now commercial stagnation
arises the instant the flow of foreign gold suffers
a temporary stoppage, for the country cannot
stand the ceaseless drain necessary to pay in-
terest on borrowed capital unless more capital
is forthcoming, to add to the load in its turn,
and necessitate still further borrowing. Every
financial society which pays dividends in London
out of Australian investments —every “repre-
sentative” colonial who leaves home to grovel to
British royalty, and exhibit his gilded ignorance
in the mother country —makes an addition to
the burden. And the absentee proprietor is an
active political evil in addition to his other sins.
He is the “bond,” above all others, which
unites Australia to the troubled destinies of the
Old World, and, like bonds in general, it is
necessary to pay interest on him. He is one of
the greatest obstacles to land reform in the
future, for his existence will make land-
nationalisation in Australasia an international
question, to be argued, it may be, as
the cause of the Egyptian bondholders was
argued a few years ago at Alexandria, and as it
bade fair to be argued a few days ago on the
coast of Guatemala. He is the incarnation of
the pawnshop and the loan-agency-—the
apotheosis of the bill-of-sale —the embodiment
on a gigantic scale of that spirit of enterprise
which makes a small advance on a shirt at <5
per slient. He exists simply that this country
may send him the interest regularly, and when
he has increased and multiplied at his present
ratio for a few years more it will become neces-
sary to send him pretty nearly the whole
country to settle his claims upon it. Mexico
was for many years a favourite field of specula-
tion, and she went broke under the infliction.
The Argentine Republic lias tried it, and the
results to-day are eminently disastrous. India
is in a woeful state of poverty under the same
infliction. Egypt has been occupied by a
British Army whose mission it is to keep
its eye on the interests of British investors, no
matter who may be killed in the process. New
Zealand has suffered ten years of abject depres-
sion in her efforts to recover from the influence
of too much foreign capital. The absentee
proprietor is everywhere objectionable, whether
he takes the form of the millionaire landholder,
who has gone home to spend his income and
make a painful exhibition of his vulgarity, or
assumes another aspect as the European, Asian,
and Australasian Investment and Mortgage Asso-
ciation, with a capital of £3,000,000 of British
money, all of which is to be ultimately repaid
tenfold by the unfortunate country which that
enterprising body proposes to exploit. Only
the latter labours under additional obloquy as
an elaborate joint-stock cormorant, whose
systematic habits of plunder probably make
him in the end a good deal the more expensive
of the two.
The Queensland M sa[?]e.
The new mosaic Ministry of Queen.. .and has
astonished both political parties and pleased
neither. Yet it is strategically strong, because
lion, members of the present Opposition, though
numerically ahead, will avoid dissolution as a
leper. The country has become so disgusted
with “the twins Moreheau and Pattisox
—and their tail, that, were an appeal made to
the constituencies straight away, the new
oki kkith-MTr avkaith combination would carry
all before it. Disappointed Groom can never
head a formidable third party, and the days of
Darling Downs-cnwi-Ipswioh “bunches” are
over. A dissolution just now would simply
send Griffith, MTtavkaith and Co. “in”
for a five-years’ good chance ; whereas,
if they make any mistakes after a while,
or if certain very possible contingencies
happen, a dissolution may be “safer” in
one or two years than it now presents itself to
a perturbed lot of recipients of £25 sterling
per month. The Ministerial combination cer-
tainly is curious. The late MTlwraithians
say that it is that hateful Mte noir of their’s—
“ a Queen-street Governmentwhile the late
Griffithites profess to abhor the action of their
late demi-god, Sir Samuel, in completing an
unholy alliance with such a “fiat contra-
diction” as MTlwraith, and such a cham-
pion of that execrable tiling, Black Labour,
as Cowley. Let us look into things. Out
of a Ministry of eight, there are certainly
five who may fitly be described as ‘ ‘ Queen-
street men ” —namely, Griffith, MTlwraith
(as member for North Brisbane, though he
has squatting and mining and meat-preserving
and commercial interests in many parts of
Queensland), Unmack (a Brisbane accountant
and member for the suburb of Toowong), T. J.
Byrnes (a young Brisbane barrister), and
W. H. Wilson (a Brisbane solicitor). The
other three may be thus written down: —
Tozer, a Gympie mining lawyer, with slight
interests in Charters Towers, Rockhampton,
and (probably) Ipswich ; Cowley, a Northern
planter, and nothing else ; Hodgkinson, an ex-
oflicial of cosmopolitan experience and who is
like Paul in the matter of being ‘ ‘ all things to
all men,” but Northern, because a Gulf repre-
sentative. By the way, the disgusted ex-
Griffithites need not, after Sir Samuel’s blend-
ing with the formerly ultra-MTlwraithian
Hodgkinson, have been surprised at the not
very much greater somersault of the present
combination.
* # *
So long as the Mosaic Ministry keeps ‘ ‘ white ”
with the people on the question of black labour,
it will remain in a strong position. And neither
Griffith nor MTlwraith is likely to call up
the old ghost that made victory possible to one
and defeat a certainty to the other. It has
been officially announced, too, that Cowley
joins the Ministry on two give-and-take condi-
tions—(l) He is to acquiesce in the burial of
black labour ; and (2) he is to be allowed a free
voice and a free vote on the Separation question.
In the latter, Hodgkinson is also with Cowley,
unless this redoubtable leopard has qnce more
changed his ‘ ‘ spots. ” Speculate awhile on the
strategic strength of the Ministerial position.
“ The twins,” if any credit is to be placed into
authoritative statements of their closest chums,
want badly to go to England in connection w ith
certain interests dear to each. And they intend
to go soon. Donaldson is to lead the Opposi-
tion, with Macrossan as his chief lieutenant.
That means, of course, the pure Opposition.
There will be additionally the angular Opposi-
tion of Messrs. Groom, Macfarlane and Co.—
the goody-goody element thus supporting the
(in a Pickwickian sense) veritable Sous of
Belial. But neither the Sous of Light nor the
Sons of Mammon have the slightest intention
just now of risking their £25 a rnoftth, and
should one faction “ try on” a vote, the other
will assuredly support the Mosaic for the occa-
sion.
# # *
But what of the future ? It may be accepted
as a golden prediction that Sir Charles Lilley
will shortly resign the Chief Justiceship and re-
enter politics as a Red Radical and Labour
leader. In that connection, note ..that Sir
Samuel Griffith is now Premier and Attorney-
General as well. Rise, the next Chief Justice
of Queensland, as the figure rose before Saul at
the bidding of En dor’s witch 1 In that case, will
Sir Thomas MTlwraith become Premier, or
will he, before then, have been “ provided fort”
He lias long been sick of Queensland politics,
but he is and always was ‘‘ a dog to turn and
fight,” and so he has remained till now,
glum and inscrutable, till he has been the
extra torpedo to oust late colleagues
who had thoroughly earned his opposition.
Vengeance sated, will he care to remain in
Queensland, since he has passed the . greatest
altitude of his political parabola ? Here it
occurs to us that the Agent-General of Queens-
land is a Member of the Queensland Ministry—
or should be, according to Griffith’s precedent
with Sir James Garrick. The present Agent-
General, Thomas Archer, was MTlwraith’s
own appointee, and supplanted Garrick, who
was Griffith’s own appointee, when Griffith
fell in 1888. But times have changed, and
MTlwraith has been asked to contest his
native town of Ayr, for the British House of
Commons. “Put that and that together,
and that’s not so dusty.” We merely
surmise, but, surmising on, what then ? Why,
Lilley and Labour. At present, we led
inclined to hail such a prospect. But we
sympathise with Morehead, all the same, that
he has so long fretfully clung to otlicc without
achieving that tawdry little gew-gaw the
pewter and patches t hat enable a man to stylo
himself a K.C.M.G. ” Gone for ever !
Tire .Mosaic Ministry is safe, as a dissolution
would set it up for live years ; black labour is
dead : Separation is an open question : (he
financial policy is likely to be taxation of
dividends, more tariff, emendation, and the
lessening gradually to the vanishing point of
Government endowments to Divisional Boards,
such endowments now being totalled at the rate
of £2 to every £ I of rates.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Ominous Apparition.
This borrowed Avail is republished in Melbourne
Stanhaud as a humble ottering to Australian
Toryism
The national governments of the present day find them-
selves confronted by the ominous apparition of an intel-
lectual demon which their own spell has invoked, and,
like the bungling necromancer of mediiuval fame, they are
now puzzled as to the proper means to resort to m order
to lay it. The demon is the demon of Socialism ; it is only
intellectual in the sense of its being the creature of an
erroneous system of education, for which these govern-
ments are responsible.
Air “erroneous system ot education ’ in this
case obviously means any system of education
which enables the world to realise what a poor,
mean lot its rulers really are, and which tends
to diminish its reverence for that glorious thing
known as the Throne. The Socialist suffers
from an objectionable idea that it is absurd to
grovel in adoration before an expensive fetich,
simply because that fetich is hired at
an enormous cost to do something that he
generally has not brains enough to do in any
case, and which the nation could easily do
itself at a hundredth part the cost and with all
the grovel left out, and which also might be
left undone without anyone being at all the
wiser. Ho has been -created by education,
because man requires to know something before
he is able to recognise the fact that his rulers
don’t know anything in particular, and the
education was no doubt “erroneous” in this
sense, for it is an idiotic error in any class that
wants to hang on to its fat offices and its land-
steals and other perquisites, to allow the nation
which it livqs upon to learn that it can do
better without it. It is also a miserably erro-
neous thing to let the country know that it
doesn’t need an aristocracy, and that a landlord
is not essential to happiness, and that a monarch
is no earthly use, and that a Gold-Stick-ill -
Waiting and a Master of the Horse, and an
Established Church, and an old, wheezy Com-
mander-in-Chief, are collectively of no more
service than a monkey sitting on a stump ;
and with a view to preventing a general
knowledge of these things, the Governments
who are harassed by the v apparition ” in
question, diffused alxmt as little education as
they could. The mistake which promises to
undo them is that they failed to recognise what
a very small amount of education is required
to capsize the old and what a
tremendous amount of ignorance is needed to
prop them up. A population which is far
enough advanced to spell “dog” without an
“r” is getting to be filled up with dangerous
information, and is liable at any moment to lose
its reverence for monarchy and the laws of pro-
perty and the House of Peers and the vicar and
the local squire, and the C.M.G., and when this
reverence is gone the Government may look for
the arrival of an “ ominous apparition ” at any
moment.
«. -

Under its present Tory management the Aus-
tralian Natives’ Association might as well be
the Primrose League, or a Vice-Regal Protec-
tion Society. Beyond a perpetual license to
love the Queen with a loud voice, and a special
permit to “tighten those silken bonds,” &c.,
the organized son of Australia enjoys'no birth-
right advantages over the humble earth-worm,
or creeping lizard. His chief article of Associa-
tion is the National Anthem, and his political
aspirations are controlled by a board of directors
who delight to chain him up in the way ho
shouldn't go. If, as occasionally happens, he.
developed a strange yearning for the infinite
and >a practical desire to open out, then imme-
diately the iron paw of a special committee lays
hold upon his soul and wipes the floor with it.
Recently the Collingwood (Melb.) Branch of
Natives arranged to meet together and hear
what one Rosa, “ the unemployed agitator,”
had to say about Socialism. There is no
apparent reason why Rosa shouldn’t be allowed
to chip in his remarks on Socialism as freely as
Lord Hopktoux— another unemployed agitator
—is permitted to go drivelling around concern-
ing the blessings of a constitutional form of
government which includes a House of Peers.
The one appears to be representing men who
want to work for a living, while the other
is an official mouthpiece of the classes who can
live without wanting to work at all. Anyhow,
the Collingwood Natives had consented to give
Rosa a fair hearing when the supreme President
of the Association wrote to say they mustn’t,
because the idea was “preposterous,” and
“beyond all limits” fixed by the grovelling
guardians of young Australian thought. By
way of salve for Collingwood’s bruised manhood,
however, several members of the Board of Direc-
tors have volunteered to substitute for the ad-
dress on Socialism a spirited lecture on Capital,
or a paper on the Blessings of Free Discussion.
A Bash Undertaking'.
New Zealand, like New South Wales, possesses
an Upper Chamber of nominees who can only be
'•ot rid of by the kindly assistance of death, and
she is at last beginning to realise that they don’t
die fast enough to be of much 'service. Conse-
quently Colonel Whitmore has introduced a
scheme for the amendment of the Constitution
by limiting the term of the irresponsible legis-
lator to 10 years, and he hopes by this measure
to get rid of him before he has turned com-
pletely bad. From this it will readily be
observed that the Colonel is of a sanguine turn
of mind. In almost every case the member of
the Upper House is prematurely-old and men-
tally exhausted when he begins his career.
There is no excitement, no glory, and no show
of usefulness in his position, and he accepts it
chiefly because it offers him the use of a calm
spot where he can cast anchor and moulder
away in peace. The country pays him to
moulder, and he does it. He is nominally
appointed for the purpose of checking hasty
legislation, but if he is found attempting
it. measures are generally taken to make
him stop. He is supposed to legislate
a little on his own account, but when
he makes any effort in that direction
he makes such unsutferable confusion that the
elective chamber brings him up short. It is
also his business to keep a sober, unbiassed eye
on the public expenditure, but he knows better
than to try any such experiment: for if he were
caught doing it he would be alwffishcd. The
only thing he is allowed to do is to moulder
officially and propound venerable theories lioru
of the solemn calm and old fogey ism of his sur-
roundings, and under these circumstances it is
a matter of comparative indifference whether i o
moulders for 10 years or tor life Duly as tho
conditions of Government require that lmshould
be squashed whenever he tries t.o do anything
that the Lower House wouldn't have done,
equally well without him, it is perhaps ad vis
able that he should be as old and senile as
possible, so as to facilitate the squashing process.

a man, or a body of men, should habitually
tread on another, it is folly to seek to
infuse extra vigour into the trodden-on
party. If New Zealand intends to adhere
to the nominee system she had better be
content with the inoffensive fossil she has
got, instead of trying to raise up a compara-
tively young and vigorous fossil which might
give trouble. If she should decide instead to
have a Council elected by the people on a
liberal basis, she will get a body which will be
a mere reflex and duplicate of the Assembly,
and in that case it would be just the same
thing to have no Council at all; and if she
should adopt the Victorian principle, and elect
the Upper House on a property qualification,
she will be merely organising the cause of
Capital and old Toryism, and placing it in a
position to fight against the democratic tend-
encies of the. peoples’ representatives. The
Upper House, in short, should be let alone
till the nation has time to abolish it. Its
mission is to inspect and review the reckless
acts of the popular Chamber, but so long as
it understands that it will be killed on the spot
if it is found attempting to execute its mission
in any practical way its presence doesn’t matter
so very much. But considering the amount of
trouble which a new colony experiences before
it succeeds in calming down the Upper Obstruc-
tion into a fitting state of uselessness, it is
something approaching insanity to attempt to
rouse it up again, and make fresh difficulties.
The New Zealand House of Lords has been in a
reasonably torpid and frozen state for some
years past, and the country has enough on its
hands at present without endeavouring to throw
it out.
The Dyed-Haii' Man.
We should imagine that a perusal of “ Darkest
Africa ” would be sufficient to convey, even to
the most fatuous of Stanley’s admirers, some
idea of the real littleness of their hero. Major
Bartelott, who was murdered, comes in for a
full measure of censure, especially for his atro-
cious wickedness in sending away Stanley’s
baggage (containing the celebrated hair-dye).
It is on this that Stanley especially harps when
referring to Troup and Bonny. The idea of
his own infallibility is what he strives to
impress on the reader throughout the book.
The fiasco of the rear-guard he ascribes
to “ a supernatural malignant influence at
work to thwart honest intention,” and,
although he does not say so in as many
words, evidently insinuates that reading the
Bible twice through was a considerable help to
success. Of the nigger-hunting and shooting
that went on we have a sufficiently full account,
the responsibility of it being calmly ascribed to
God. The gallant Captain Chari.es Sturt,
whom Australians leave unhonoured, wrote at
the end of his last journal; ‘‘ My path amongst
savage tribes has been a bloodless one, not but
that I have often been placed in situations of
risk and danger, when I might have been justi-
fied in shedding blood, but I trust I have ever
made allowances for human timidity, and res-
pected the customs of the rudest people.” How
do these modest and manly words read beside
the nauseous egotism of that blushless self-
advertiser, Brigand Stanley, of the dyed hair ?

A fancy illustration of party Government—
which ought to come in neatly somewhere after
The Bulletin’s recent comments on Govern-
ment by Contradiction—is to hand from Queens-

Wheii an innocently-accused man leaves the
criminal dock he doesn’t often forgive the man
w'ho was at once his false accuser and his mali-
cious prosecuting lawyer. Yet Sir Thomas
MTlwraith and Sir Samuel Griffith stand
to each other in this precise sort of personal
relation. The former was accused of gigantic
swindles and personal pecuniary benefits, and the
latter pursued him relentlessly, causing him to
spend thousands of pounds in the defence of his
personal character, and even to undertake a
journey to England to plead before the Privy
(lounciL When Sir Thomas triumphantly
emerged from a prolonged pursuit by the clever-
est lawyer in Queensland, even though public
occasions offered, and little would have been
accepted as a full apology, Sir Samuel refused to
retract a single statement or charge preferred.
No only so refused, but brought up the “swindle”
Again and again at public opportunities and in
persistently repeated defamations. Sir Thomas
vehemently once declared that he could never
take. Sir Samuel’s hand again, as Sir Samuel
had virtually wished to place him as a felon in
a dock, and had not the manliness to attempt
to even modify his most strenuous bitterness.

are now' the Siamese Twins of the new Queens-

The great Building Society case at Melbourne
police-court, should be coming to an utterly
monstrous conclusion this week. At some times
a screaming joke, at others a drunken, rowdy
farce, the case finally resolved itself into a
serious insult to the name of justice. It was on
last Tuesday morning that the law, as repre-
sented at police-courts, was knocked clean out of
time by, the weight of influential respectability
opposed to it. As a matter of plain, unvarnished
intention all the parties accused of conspiracy,
with the solitary exception of Mr. Dow , were
committed for trial. Chairman Panton stated
that the Bench, being fully empowered to end
the case there and then, had decided to dis-
charge Mr. Dow, and send everybody else
(although with great reluctance in the cases of
Ximmo, Ferguson and Stewart) to a higher
Court. Whereupon the counsel for the verbally,
but not yet formally, committed parties rose,
one after the other, and induced, persuaded, or,
as some will say, bullied the Bench into taking
back their decision until they (the counsel) had
made speeches for the defence. Next day the
Chairman took ill, and those speeches have been
delivered in his absence. Should Mr. Panton’s
original decision be changed, under such extra-
ordinary circumstances, Thk Bulletin will
endeavour to unravel the mystery next week.
At the very time that Federation proposals
have been adopted by, or are still under the
consideration of, all the Australian Govern-
ments, the said Governments seem all to be
falling to pieces. In Victoria, Gillies’ Coali-
tion Ministry has survived a vote of want of
confidence, but seems hobbled with the clanging
chains of a log-rolling Railway Bill, and is being
unreservedly denounced by the Age as a
Ministry of Jobbery. In Queensland, the
Parliament has erupted into the extraordinary
Griffith-M Ml wraith combination. In South
Australia, Playforh has defeated the Cock-
burn Ministry, and a new Court reigns. In
Tasmania, the Government has just escaped
capsize. In New South Wales—well, it doesn’t
much matter how things are in New South
Wales, for the Mother Colony is at general
variance with most of her progeny. Queer ?
- ♦
More should come of that deadlock between the
New South Wales Minister for Instruction and
the New South Wales Civil Service Board in
regard to the appointment of Mr. George
Mill eh to the position of Comptroller-General
of Local Prisons. The present stage of the
difficulty is neither satisfactory to the Minister
nor to the Board, and is eminently unsatisfac-
tory to the public at large. The Board’s
primary function is to fill up vacancies in the
Service. Parliament and the country gave it
existence for that special work. In the case
under discussion, however, the vacancy was not
reported to the Board, and the Minister’s—not
the Board’s—fiat established Mr. Miller in the
post. Minister and Board have, after dis-
courteous reference to each other, lapsed now
into stubborn silence. Why does not some
member stir the Assembly on the subject?
Wisely enough the Civil Service Act allows
appointments to lie made to the Service on
account of special qualifications which cut-and-
dry rules cannot reach; but the question is
whether a merely temporary occupant of a
Ministerial position, or whether a regularly -
constituted Board, is to be judge of this special
fitness? If the Minister, are the days of
patronage dead ?
What is to be substituted in New South Wales
for imprisonment for non-payment of libel verv
diets? The Bulletin responds that there is
no need to substitute for it anything in particu-
lar. Imprisonment for mere debt is an iniquity
—a mere survival of barbarism—and imprison-
ment for “contempt of Court,” i.e., for non-
payment of lawyers’ perquisites, is one of the
most shameless of the numerous frauds which
the land-shark guild are still privileged to
commit. The cry that to abolish imprisonment
in such cases would be to let loose on the
community “ a host of libellers,” loses all
force, when it is remembered that a man
can only be fairly imprisoned for libel when
he has been found guilty of criminal libel
after a proper trial before a jury. The
arguments used by Judge Trench in these
columns a week or two ago apply to all
alleged offences—whether against property,
person or character. When a man is charged
with libel let him, if the grand jury of the
country thinks fit to file a bill, be placed on his
trial on two counts —firstly, criminal libel, an
offence against the State; secondly, for
damages at the suit of the individual aggrieved.
Let the two cases be tried together, and let one
jury ladle-out both damages or imprisonment,
or damages and imprisonment as they may
think necessary. If the jury are shown that
the libel is a bad and deliberate one, the
offender will go to gaol for a period within the
maximum fixed by the statute, as the unfortu-
nate Reseigh Martin has gone to gaol. With
this difference, however, that you will not find
juries committing the atrocities perpetrated
under the present system of judge-made
sentences. Where would be the logic of im-
prisoning a man whom a jury had pronounced
guiltless of crime, merely because he had no
money wherewith to satisfy a civil verdict for
damages ?
John Henry Newman.
The death of John Henry Newman is not, in the
proper sense of words, a calamity or even a
bereavement. He went out at the age of 90, not
as a candle goes out when the flame reaches the
socket, not as the sun goes down when it reaches
the horizon, but as a fire, which has blazed and
smouldered its substance away, cools off into
white ash. His eyes did not see the world going
by, his ears did not hear its vehement words,
and if they heal’d, the language was as
that of a planet on which his feet had
never trod. There is reverence in the sym-
pathy which bemoans his departure, but
there are insincerity and affectation in it also.
John Henry Newman was dead long before the
cardinal’s hat was placed on his white head, or
the red stockings of ecclesiastical authority bound
his ankles. That which was great in him, that
which made him one of the first dozen English-
men of 30 years ago, had fought its last battle and
retired to rest before Pius IX. asserted the Papal
Infallibility, or Napoleon 111. handed up sword
and crown. Since that day the great priest would,
dead, have been as potent in the world’s affairs as
he was living. The demise of the other day was,
then, but a performance of the technical act of
dying, and lamentations over it arc but custom’s
tribute, itself a thing purely technical also, or
folly’s indulgence in the occupation of entertaining
itself with its own sorrows.
# * *
Fifty years ago Newman was in his prime. His
thoughts were those of a man in whose being the
roots of immortality had struck deep, and the
fragrance and flowers of the evergreen tree intoxi-
cated his senses. Bird and beast, and earth and
sky, all told him of his soul; history, ancient and
modern, told him of it; tyrannies, pestilences,
and famines told him of it; and the murder of
man by man told him of it. The world turned on
its axis or revolved about the sun, and every sign
of the zodiac spoke to him of his soul. What
could such a man do but hunt through palimpsests
and parchments for directions on the matter, once
he accepted the premise that directions on the
topic were given to man ? Newm&n’s 1 1 ands turned
pagei? endlessly, his eyes were ceaseless interroga-
tions of persons and events. His sermons wei*
queries, his explanations investigations. In no
man was the union between head and heart closer,
the head speaking through the heart and the heart
beating in the head, but thought and throb went
all to soul, and to soul only. When the fight was
in the open, while the individual faced the uni-
verse and strove to wrest from it the secret as to
which labyrinthine doctrinal passage would lead
him out to light, the spectacle was one to inflame
enthusiasm and excite love. The battle was so
unequal, the labyrinths so numerous, and the in
dividual so insistent, with never a false syllable
from his lips, and never a quiver of despair
in his heart, that it is no wonder young
Oxford went to' his feet and ingenuous minds
everywhere studied his words. And the words in
themselves were worth study. The English
language was never used with better effect. Ab-
struse though many of his themes were, and
involved his sentences, the sense held itself
dominant and was apprehensible almost by all. In
imaginative power he was much less strong than
many of his contemporaries, but so spiritualised
was his existence that a glow akin to that of the
highest imaginative quality was shed on all his
woi’k. But when “ Kindly Light ” led him on, as
he had prayed it to do, and he put the stole of fct.
Philip Neri around his neck, the battle was over.
His movements in the direction of higher education
and his bickerings with Cardinal Cullen over the
rectorship of Dublin University, as well as his en-
counter with Gladstone on the Vatican Decrees are
all within the sphere where any ordinary mediocre
man can, if he so like, make himself look tem-
porarily great. And the Cardinal seemed to know
it. He confined himself closer to his oratory,
built higher and higher the wall between himself
and the outside world, and holding his soul in his
hands- the soul over which his life-work had been
spent—he waited for the summons to drop into
dust. If men have souls, and those souls are saved
in that way, there can be no doubt that John
Henry Newman s is now happy.
DISCRIMINATING- SCISSORS.
The Tintamarre.
“ Not’ Maitre, this is the Tintamarre*
Of the village of Oarmeray.”
So spoke a sunburnt campagnard
By the Beauron’s winding way.
From hand to hand, f&nn voice to voice,
Five hundred years, men say,
It has summoned the weary to rejoice
At the death of the worker’s day ;

At the first sweet sound of the vesper-bell
The harvester drops the hay ;
And leaving the last tree where it fell,
The wood-cutter turns away.
Then he thinks how his father’s fathers toiled
From dawn to dusk of day :
And he crosses his tools in the Tintamarre,
And he bares his brow to pray.
The hurrying ploughman stops half-way
In the furrow turned for grain •
Alone, he doubles the roundelay,
And with whetstone strikes his ryain ;
The ditcher, clearing his dusty throat,
Sends on the same refrain,
Till the wandering goat-herd, note for note
Gives the Haro back again.
Still the miller reckons his empty sacks,
As he stays in the mill alone ;
Still the miserly farmers bend their backs,
For the harvest is all their own.
And—-ha !ha! ha ! “It would grieve a Turk,”
The wiseacres sighing, say,
“That the precious daylight God gave for work,
Men and women should dance away. ”
Now the fiddler’s time of toil begins,
Yet he, too, gives thanks to heaven ;
For, old and blind, he hardly wins
The scanty bread of seven.
And clattering after his dancing feet
Come the village children all,
As they mimic the sounds of the Tintamarre,
And echo the elders’ call;
“ Ha-ro-o !
Jacques, Renaud.
Dieu pardoint au bon Comte Thibaut!
Ha-ro-o !

Au tout bon Comte de Blois !”

Still, the grandsires say, does the good Comte’s
soul
Haunt forest ahd champ and clos,
Still he claims his lordship on every bole,
And from every furrow thus takes his toll:

Dieu pardoint au Comte de Blois ! ”

* According to a tradition, Count Thibaut, of Blois,
taking pity on the lot of those who toiled in the fields,
fixed the hour for beginning and ending the day’s work.
Every evening, when the bell of the tower had rung, one
could hear the workmen nearest to the tower warning
their fellow-toilers, either by shout or by the sound of
their picks and spades, which they struck against one
another. This was the Tintamarre, and during the con-
fused hum could be heard the grateful shouts, “ God
pardon the good Count of Blois ! Monteil.

it cannot be contended that he is incapable of see-

Sardou’s play is admirably staged—though the
scene in the first act is somewhat cramped
and well impersonated, albeit one or two ot the
minor parts might be in abler hands. That Janet
Achurch’s Fedora is a fine performance is made
more thoroughly evident by the S.M. Herald’s
attempt to depreciate it by comparison with that
of the creator of the part, Sara Bernhardt. This
“ set ” at the young actress has caused some com-
ment among those who noticed how studiously
such methods were avoided in that quarter during
the Potter-Bellew season; but, doubtless, the
writer is fully justified, for any comparison
between Bernhardt and a mere imitator, would
have been ridiculous, and therefore Miss Achurch
may look on the pai-allel drawn in her case as a
great, if involuntary, compliment. Anyhow, she
gives us a very fine reading of the character; a
little overacted in gesture and facial expression in
the third act, when Ipanoff has the scene
to himself, but, nevertheless, perfectly coherent
in its rapid transitions from laughter to tears,
from vengeful pursuit to tender solicitude. George
Titheradge’s impersonation of Loris Ipanoff is one
of his best, nay, his very best, and furnishes a dis-
play of tragic power and emotion of which we did
not think him capable. The Qpuntess Olga of
Fanny Enson, though a very different character,
is up to the high standard of her Louise ; Charles
Charrington, if not brilliant, is painstaking and
correct as de Seriex; and Herbert Flemming, com-
pletely disguised as Gretch in a curly wig and
moustache, makes the most of an abbreviated
opportunity. Alice May is a very nice, though
somewhat shamefaced boy, Harry Leston’s Desire
is acceptable, Brian England’s Rouvel gentle-
manly and easy, but theßolslas Lasinskiof “ Boh”
Watson would more fitly grace “ Muldoon’s
Picnic,” and the red-bosomed Borloff of J. P.
West suggests a Greek ex-pirate who has also re-
tired—on a competence—from the ice-cream, or
oyster-and-fruit trade.

The return of the popular Maggie Moore,
skittish and in good voice, to Her Majesty’s stage
has wonderfully picked up the house ; though
“Meg” seems even greater drivel than before.
Harry Jewett is as effective as it is possible to be
when loaded with ridiculous improbabilities, and
that really wonderful child, Violet Aston (erstwhile
“ Baby ” Nidi oils) is a host in herself. As hinted
last week, “Macbeth” will be produced on the
30th. Rignold will play the name-part, the Lady
Macbeth will be —Miss Janet Achurch ! Herbert
Flemming will tackle Malcolm, and Charles
Charrington will endeavour to get away with
Macd uff. Harry Jewett may impersonate Duncan,
but more probably will take a holiday.

Rickards talks of increasing the size of the pit by
making a new gallery entrance and seating the
stalls with 300 opera-chairs. Matinee performance

The sixth week of “ Paul Jones ” opened
to a great declension of business, so great as to
make it evident that the announcement of “Boc-
caccio ” for Aug. 30 was not premature. During
the week the fair Ellen’s bronchial tubes have been
a little out of order, and one evening when the
very popular trio of the third act was encored, she
made ill-health an excuse for refusing the repe-
tition.

The enthusiasm attending Frances Savile’s
Melbourne performances, after nearly six years’
absence, has led people there to remark that she is
not fully appreciated in Sydney. No greater
favourite ever stepped on a Sydney platform, but
as the local musical societies prefer to hire
auxiliary talent from other cities or even to utilise
incapable amateurs, rather than the high-class
professional residents, Sydney audiences rarely
hear her. The Sydney professional is always in
demand when charity performances are being
given, but, as a rule, when money is to be paid for
services, then amateur managers go further afield.
Charity begins at home, and Sydney’s professionals
are being gradually starved off to other cities.

It is now a dreadful thing in Sydney to

which the local Evening News now reports com

James Heggui, 57, bailiff, was fined

and disorderly in Upper-street, and an
additional 10s., or two days, for having
used bad language.
at Melbourne Bijou last Saturday night. Other-
wise the show seems a little less excellent than of
vor» and seeing that a satire on sassiety jour-
nalism never pleases the ladies, who like to behold
a gorgeous description of their furniture and tea-
fights published in the local flunkey press, “The
Glass ” has been wisely limited to a six-nights’ run.
It is a sparkling entertainment, but bare-necked
darlings don’t go to the theatre to wince. The
feelings of the typical Miss Smith, who whiles the
springtime of her life away in requesting editors
to mention that she “looked nice, as usual,” are
harrowed by a comedy of this caustic character.
Certain Melbourne journals should band together
and apply f° r an injunction to restrain B. and B.
from heaping further contempt upon their (the
aforesaid journals’) literary items. On Saturday
next “ The Parvenu,” first produced in Australia
at the old Melbourne Princess’s, will bo revived,
with Anson in his original London character.

Another sustained rush of paying and
dead-head public to the Opera House welcomed
the return of Widow O’Brien. Of Sheridan’s im-
mortal creation a list of stereotyped praises may
be taken as read. The little man conceals his
identity under the Widow’s robes and false front
as completely as ever. He nothing exaggerates
nor sets down aught in malice, a Shakespeare
misquotation which also applies to The Bulletin,
God bless it ! John Forde takes the place of
Kelly as the Italian noble, with advantage to the
comedy interest, but for the rest, an increase of
variety business has not done much for “Fun on
the Bristol,” beyond spinning it to a time when
its early virtues are well-nigh forgotten. Even
the Sappho dance suffers from over-elaboration,
and the Harvey Brothers, alleged to be miracles
in their way, only serve to remind us that the
Raynors were much more artistic in a similar
direction. But one of those inimitable brethren
has been playing weird instruments on the Golden
ghoah these many months, and a live Harvey is
probably more useful for worldly purposes than
a dead Raynor.

Mrs. Potter has relapsed into “ Mdlle. de
Bressier,” at Melbourne Princess’s, Here again
the fair lady’s F renchy mannerisms seem to suit
the character, and as often as not she is discovered
to be doing the right thing in the right way.
Bellew likewise appeals to the dress-circle with his
average force in the capacity of the sculptor who
cannot marry Mrs. Potter until she has routed out
the corpse of her late, lamented by way of
moist, unpleasant proof that she doesn’t
meditate bigamy. “ Mdlle. de Bressier ” is
a difficult play to lay hold of and consider
calmly, as Sydney audiences are aware, but it
contains many bright gleams of bloodshed and
misery, and becoming hats, not to mention some
respectable acting by others than the beautiful
stars. Sass, Miss Williamson, Wilson, Forbes,
and Diver appear to advantage. If the last-
named young man could but conquer his nervous-
ness, and put on flesh and voice, he might paralyse
them one of these days, for the soul of the artist
evidently beats within his slim torso. There has
been some talk of producing a new classical play,
“Hero and Leander,” next Saturday, but the
dangerous experiment may not come off on that
date, in which case another agony from the
French, of which Mrs. Potter has dozens, will
probably be called for.

Business at the Royal has been brisker
since “The Lucky Lot” began to play its old
stage-tricks upon that section of the public which
loves to see villainy knocked prostrate by a meat-
axe or small blunderbuss at every critical moment.
Although the education of the classes goes inarch-
ing on, like John Brown’s knapsack, there is still
a shock-headed percentage of mass ready to accept
a foggy-voiced bandit, in well-blacked Welling-
tons and an aggravating simper, as the
personification of all that is best in British
drama. Unfortunately, however, the truth
concerning that steeplechase act is slowly
leaking forth, and as it becomes noised
abroad that George Darrell’s ride for free-
dom, with a supposititious Christina in his strong
right arm, is actually perpetrated by an experi-
enced ostler who clutches a life-sized rag-doll, the
demand for realism will probably fall off. The
conviction that George Darrell and Christina are
waiting behind the scenes meanwhile, ready to
come forward and scoop the glory that properly
belongs to a nameless equestrian and his sackful
of shreds and patches, is not elevating to the
observant mind. If it was fair to laugh at Carrie
Swain’s hona fide swim around a tank, it is fair
to snort at a sensation absurd in conception
and fictitious in the carrying out. Why not en-
gage Tommy Corrigan to make the leap, and star
that popular artist as chief performer ? Christine
Darrell’s singing has improved since the first night,
and her limelight dance--in which, after bemoan-
ing her penniless condition, she flashes brown silk
stockings and boots to match —is understood to be
a further proof of the young lady’s budding genius.
Another lively feature of “ The Lucky Lot” is a
little grassy mound, representing somebody’s grave.
No gaudy granite tombstone, or gilt railings, dis-
figure the hallowed spot, but a quantity of paper
poppies, planted on the last resting-place by loving
hands, are doosid affecting.
Dearest mother’s prayer is granted,
She is safe in Heaven’s bowers,
Where her weary bones were planted
Friends have stuck some paper flowers.

The presence of a valiant curate in ‘ ‘ The
Golden Ladder” is responsible for a sudden in-
flux of clergy to the Alexandra “circle.” Com-
fortable-looking shepherds beam across their
white chokers at the spectacle of the Reverend
Somebody keeping everybody at bay with a
revolver, or flourishing a thick stick around a
strong situation, while he explains that he is a
desperate man. In truth, the Alexandra drama
acts as an antidote to the “ Private Secretary,”
wherein the chosen apostle was invariably ad-
dressed as a “miserable worm,” and con-
stantly being pitched into the coal-scuttle
hy a worldly-minded uncle. One of these
nights the management will announce a
special Evangelical performance under the patron-
age of Field Flowers Goe, after which a fusty
fear of the Devil, which alone keeps many wealthy
old dodderers away from the temples of Thin-
gummy, will he melted into thin-air by the
Bishop’s abundant smile. Asa play, apart from
the splendour of its scenery, “The Golden
Ladder ” improves on acquaintance, a serio-comic
passage, dealing with the parson’s bill for board
and residence, being especially bright and human.
The one weak part in the mounting is aa office-
table, so ingeniously constructed that, with a
change of scene, it can be shifted back a few yards
and converted into a sideboard. Sometimes this
combination bit of furniture gets through the
trying ordeal all right, but sometimes the table
turns into a sideboard before its time, and every-
body wonders where the clown and pantaloon
come in. Walter Howe has displaced Rosier, for
a while, in the parson’s billet, ?md business looks
healthy.

The friends of Geo. 0. Miln will be glad
to hear that his trip to New Zealand, which began
with misgivings, terminated in exceeding joy. At
various points of the two islands Miln knocked
persons of consequence into heaps of admiration.
Once he lured the Bishop into the theatre and
held him fast with his glittering; eye ; as for
Governor Onslow, he was so carried away by
Othello’s feelings that he thumped a small table in
front of him “ until a leg broke.” Whether the
leg belonged to the table, or to the vice-regal per-
son, or whether they each broke a leg together, has
not yet been clearly explained to us. Anyway,
Miln enjoyed a time worthy of his talents.
The students of Christchurch University threw
bunches of flowers at him, and the “ old Bluecoat-
boys ” of Auckland put their photos, into an album
and requested the tragedian to wear it next his
heart. He gave a lecture for the Ladies’, Bene-
volent Society, and accomplished other good deeds
too numerous to mention. Like a giant refreshed
he is now engaged in carving the name of Miln
deep in the memory of Wagga Wagga, and by
Tuesday next his classical standard will be proudly
floating in the breeze of Ballarat.

A certain Lady Violet Greville —dealing
with that musty chestnut, the “degeneracy” of
modern drama—attributes the alleged falling off
in stage-work to the fact that “the stalls don’t
want to think, while the pit and gallery are in-
capable of it” —the noble lady intending “it ” to
represent “thinking.” Lady Violet’s belief in
the ability of chappies and their richly-upholstered
womankind to think, if they so desired, is not
more characteristic of her caste than is the sup-
position that people paying less than ten shillings
for a seat have no brains. The dear little idiot
has forgotten Garrick’s boast that the pit (corres-
ponding withjstalls in Australia) “rose at him.”
Now, whoever heard of the English stalls rising
at anything except “God Save the Queen,” or
legs ?

Gladstone went recently to the Hay market
Theatre to hear a Mrs. Erving Winslow, of Phi la'
delphia, read Ibsen’s “The Enemy of Society.’
Before the lady had finished Act 11. the Grand
Old Man was discovered to be asleep, and Mrs.
W.E.G. mercifully took him away while there
were still two and a half acts to be put through.
The Referee suggests that it was fortunate he
didn’t stay to hear Ibsen set forth the “moral ”of
his cranky sermon, viz.; “It is the compact
Liberal majority which is the greatest enemy of
society.” Ibsen’s political theory seems to main-
tain that a country must burst up directly the
masses are sufficiently enlightened to vote solid in
support of cardinal Republican principles. The
Referee speaks highly of Mrs. Winslow as a
reader, and expresses the hope that she will turn
her attention to “ some greater and more dramatic
dramatist” than the new Norwegian fetish.
That Ibsen is an undramatic writer will not be
generally admitted, however. He may, or may
not, be an exalted prig, treating of woman’s love
without having enjoyed the love of enough women
to become an authority on the subject, and he may
be given to suppose that no other man save Ibsen
comprehends the blessing of a good drainage
system (about which he has written a play) simply
because the common or garden kind of Norwegian
is accustomed to stinks. But as a play-writer he
is essentially tricky. It would be hard for anyone
else to arrange the few incidents of “A Doll’s
House ” more effectively than the author—an old
expert in stage business —has done. Think how
he piles up the agony—hollow though it be—in
connection with Krogstadt’s epistle, after its
dramatic fall into the letter-box !

Mrs. Potter has a £4OOO setting of “Antony

suit of stock; ngette, or something. One cannot
write of it without thrilling.

George C. Miln was selected to deliver the
funeral oration on murdered President Garfield in
Chicago; consequently, when he waxes eloquent
over the corpse of Csesar, the tragedian is in con-
stant danger of amazing the Roman mob with
references to the Amurrikan Eagle and their Star-
spangled Banner. But probably they would not
be amazed. It is a question whether Caesar’s
excited supernumerary subjects would turn a hair
if Miln were to request ’em to “gaze upon the cold
clay of the President of our Great Republic,” or
“ see the rent that envious Guiteau made.”

At the Adelaide Royal “ The Mikado,”
by W. and G.’s Comic Opera Company, attracted
immense crowds for three nights, and would have
run many nights longer had not the management
been anxious to exhaust their repertoire during
the short season. Clara Merivale was a charming
Yum Yum, and, except when called on to act,
Imano was a most acceptable Pooh Bah. Mr.
Rosevear was an admirable Mikado, and Mabel
Mackay, in the absence of Fanny Liddiard, was
astonishingly good as Katisha, while Vernon,
Leumane, Grundy, with Katie Potter and May
Pollard filled the remaining parts satisfactorily.
“Princess Ida,” with Elton as King Gama, was
not a great attraction, and “ The Pirates of
Penzance,” with “Charity Begins at Home” as
an after-piece, will be shoved on to bring matters
round.

Dear Bulletin,- I suppose you are very tired of Ibsen
literature by this time, but 1 hope all the same you can
spare a few lines for ray opinion. I think that Ibsen,
being an old bachelor, knows nothing of a mother’s love,
and therefore the “ Doll’s House” is unnatural and a libel
on motherhood. Fancy a mother leaving her little ones
because her ideal is shattered! Most women have to put
up with that. I have seen women bear the greatest
brutality, both mentally and bodily, and find it impossible
to leave their children, knowing well that they could not
themselves find them bread. I cannot believe that such a
woman as Nora ever existed except in a man’s imagina-
tion.—A. H,, 3rd August, 1890.
Helen Hart was down for a “ Gospel address” at Hay-

umbrella from one of her scanty congregation, knocked
this rival orator out in one act, and then remarked, “if
mothers would treat their sons like that, there would be
fewer larrikins in Ballarat.” Whereupon her audience
laughed consumedly, and Helen in dudgeon exclaiming,
“ I’m not in the habit of being laughed at,” at once made
tracks, and left the now sore-headed dog in possession of
the field.

Substance and Shadow.

They do but grope in learning’s pedant round
Who on the phantasies of sense bestow
An idol substance, bidding us bow low
Before those shades of being which are found,
Stirring ot still, on man’s brief trial-ground ;
As if such shapes and modes, which come and go,
Had aught of Truth or Life in their poor show,
To sway or judge, and skill to sain or wound.
Son of immortal seed, high-destined man !
Know thy dread gift—a creature, yet a cause :
Each mind is its own centre, and it draws 1
Home to itself, and moulds in its thought’s span,
All outward things, the vassals of its will,
Aided by Heaven, by earth unthwarted still.

Should you read the article again, you will see that it
deals with certain premises of George’s in order to show
how the value of his own deductions may be impaired by
close reasoning from his own basis. That the imposition
of the Single-tax would cause a glut in the property
market and a consequent depreciation of rents, is only
supposititious. The over value of all property which people
then desired to rent would be also attachable by the owner,
and, as now, only land of little value, inherent Or ac-
quired, would be a drug. The worker, lacking instru-
ments of production, is little better off than the ignorant
aboriginal in the struggle with monopoly. Should he,
desiring to better his condition, borrow, then he is usury s
slave, no matter what the land system. The nationalisa-
tion of all vacant or unused land, for simplicity and
thoroughness, lays right over the Single-tax on all sides..

Marriage on Commission.
The Latest London Sensation.
London, 12th Ado., 1890.
Duncan editor of the London Matrimonial News, has
been sued by a lady for breach of promise of marriage,
the damages being laid at £25,000. The plaintiff in the
rase against Duncan is a granddaughter of Sir Francis
Charles Knowles, Bart., and is 21 years of age. Defendant
is a man of 64 years, and in the course of the trial some
•stounding revelations were made. Plaintiff deposed
that defendant had made an attempt to seduce her. He
Las been twice married, having seven children, beside six
children of illegitimate parentage. The verdict in the
case gives damages to Miss Knowles at £lO,OOO.—S. M.
Herald Cablegram.
The most astonishing thing which The Bulletin
perceives in this case is that any court of justice
should award a woman of 21 years £lO,OOO
damages because she had not succeeded in hav-
ing_ herself seduced—for that is the only term
which can property be applied to marriages
so far contravening the laws of Nature —by
a man old enough to be her grandfather.
The alleged attempted “seduction” (the word
being here used in its conventional sense) being
the plaintiff’s secret, her character could only have
Huffcred by her own disclosure of that secret. It
would, possibly, have been very proper to punish
the ancient rascal, Duncan, by a £lO,OOO fine, pay-
able into the State Treasury ; but to award £lO,OOO
damages to a young woman who sought to hand
"herself over to a man at least 43 years her senior
is a shocking perversion of every principle which
should regulate dealings between man and
woman, and affords a gigantic premium to the
Worst sort of conspiracy.
# # #
In view of this startling case, The
Bulletin's readers may be interested in an ac-
count of an interview which took place in London
about five years ago between the now notorious
Duncan and the present writer. The narrative
C ntains nothing but fact:
In the Strand, a thoroughfare in the heart of
London, miming from the Law Courts to Charing
Gross, and in which arc several theatres, many
newspaper establishments, and an endless variety
cf prosperous shops, are situated the offices of the
M atriMonial News, a small weekly eight-page
fa int, whose existence is announced to the stranger
in two ways. Firstly, there is a large display of
bills in the lower windows of a dingy building at
the corner of an off-street, and then there are
runners who flourish copies of the News aforesaid,
which, it appears from handbills, is “specialty
addressed to those who want a husband or a wife.”
Such being the case, jfcho newsboys have not the
least hesitation in enquiring of you point-blank
*' whether you want to marry ?” and they are very
frequently met with the facetious fiction, some-
times perhaps founded on fact, that the person
addressed has just been up to the adjacent Palace
of Justice, either to file a bill in divorce, or to
enter an appearance as co-respondent.

The conductor of the Matrimonial News
could hardly have chosen a less savory site for
bis Agapemone, for what King-street is to Sydney,
the Strand is to London. Felise, Yolande, and
J uliette roll by in their landaus on their way from
theJPark, while the pallid Fragoletta and the dirty
Dolores wearily pace the footpath from mid-
day to midnight, plying their sad trade. The
same miserable spectacle confronts you, week in
week out —the bright eyes and the faded
dress, the bright dress and the faded .eyes, the
painted face, the dawdling walk, the “for God’s
Lake give me twopence to get a drink.” But,
saving the poverty, which in the Strand is to the
stranger even more shocking than the vice, matters
*ire pretty nearly the same all over the “civilised”
World: —
Her lips were red, her looks were free.
Her Tocks were yellow as gold,
Her face was white as leprosy,
The nightmare Life-in-Death was she
Who chills men’s blood with cold.
# # *
We tremulously enter the clingy building
with the much-billed window, which is, it turns
out, “only the publishing department,” and are
informed by the old man behind the counter —
who suggestively enough is, as we salute him, en-
gaged in mending a mouse-trap—that the private
office of the editor his master is at 76, further up
the street. We accordingly make our way to the
address named, and find that the same staircase
which leads to what, with necessary caution, is
merely indicated as “Editor's office, first floor,”
also brings one to the Adelphi Hotel, and to the
apartments of a teacher of singing—a truly de-
lightful emharras de choix —Woman, Wine, and
Song -
Who loves not woman, wine, and song,
Remains a fool his whole life long.
' ■ * # *
The clerks’ office—there are three clerks
•—also serves, we find, as the “gentleman’s wait-
ing-room.” The clerks are all old men—but we
don’t wonder much at the editor finding it neces-
sary to have in his service none but persons with
at least one leg in the grave. The eldest of the
trio has his trousers patched at the knees. We
don't marvel very much at that, either, after we
have gathered from a sotto-vocc remark made by
him to one of his fellow-toilers that he works
every night till twelve, and then walks all the
way to Islington. How much better off he would
be as a Murrumbidgee whaler ! There are in the
room three clients beside ourselves—a Jewish
gentleman with a squint; an individual with
ginger-curls, bearing the outward semblance
(qualified by a masher-collar as high as a sheep-
hurdle) of Christianity ; and an elegantly-attired
young gentleman, looking a little bit like George
Darrell and a good deal like the County Gentle-
man’s portrait of the Earl of Rocksavagc.
Perhaps he is an earl —you never can tell in Lon-
don. The last earl we saw—it was he of Cork,
■who, as “Master of the Baokhouuds,” or some-
thing of the sort, enjoys a fat sinecure—didn’t look
by any means too aristocratic to preside over his
absent assembly of w ell-bred dogs. Yes, perhaps
he is an earl. Perhaps, further, he is waiting to
arrange with the editor fur an elopement with
the daughter of a Duke. You have, doubtles.-,
at least heard of the latest good caricature—“ the
Masher’s Eiopement,” wherein the'girl stands at
the foot of the ladder at midnight ami tenderly
hands down the man of much collar.
* # #
For half-au-hour we sit in the clerks’ office
and glare at one another. The golden-haired man
glares most. The masher chews his stick, and
the Semitic squinter adds-up rows of figures in his
pocket-book. Meanwhile two of the clerks in-
dustriously enclose in envelopes a pile of letters,
evidently containing photographs, the third looks
dreamily outinto the dreary courtyard, and a cheer-
ful canary sings what is no doubt intended as the
epithalamium of a sheepish-looking couple who
have just come out of the editor’s room opposite.
Next to the editor's room is the “ ladies’ waiting-
room,” from which at intervals proceed faint
coughs, and arouhd which hCvers the attendant, a
venerable-looking crone of three-score-and-ten,
who surety will never, on the threshold of the
sanctum, snap away a client from her master.
Presently wo hear on the stairs the tread of fairy
feet, and one minute later there stand before us
two ladies who want husbands. One is a hatchet-
faced female of 36, in black-silk and tan-gloves.
She has prominent incisors and the eye of a
Marshal Soult. When she gets married again—
for she is surety a widow—she will always say, in
speaking on behalf of herself and her husband,
“I,” while he will always say “we.” She is
accompanied by a fat person who wears chocolate-
satin and a double-chin, and remarks that “it’s
very ot in the ladies’-room ” —which observation
is probably intended to explain and extenuate this
feminine invasion of the male sanctuary. Then the
axe-visaged woman expresses to her companion a
hope that “we’ll not have to wait again for an
hour and a quarter like we did yesterday.” It
occurs to one that, outside the office of the editor
of the Matrimonial News, she and her friend
might have to wait for husbands for a very much
longer period than an hour and a quarter. How-
ever, we don’t say so, but go on reading the paper.
# * ’ *•
At last the editor’s door opens to us, and
wo are in the presence of a tall, gaunt man, who
unites in his person several of the physical pecu-
liarities of Mr. Joseph Abbott, of N.S.W. political
celebrity, and > of Mr. M‘Kean, the Melbourne
solicitor. This is the editor. Wo have often
passed him in Fleet-street and speculated as to his
occupation, which we judged to bo of a scholastic
character. Ho is more than six feet high, and,
though evidently over GO years of age, his hair has
only commenced to be tinged with what is known
to the Australian aboriginal as “flour-bag come
up.” He has a saw-sharpening voice, like that of
Gormly, M.P., of Wagga; he indulges in George
Dibbs’ trick of at one moment dropping his spec-
tacles on to the tip of his nose and at the next
ORNAMENTAL—NOT USEFUL.
DRILL-INSTRUCTOR: “DIDN’T YOU HEAR MY ORDER?-WHAT ARE YOUR
EARS FOR?”
RECRUIT: “TO KEEP MY CAP FROM SLIPPING OFF.”
elevating them to the roof of his head, and he
wears his long hair in a semi-curled, half-wavy
condition, a little after the manner of the played-
out “Nunawading Messiah.” He went straight
to business, and in a) loud voice, which we were
dreadfully afraid might be heard outside, enquired
abruptly, but with a merry twinkle in his eye ;
“ Well, do you want to be married ?”
We entreated him to sit down and bo calm. He
began to laugh with a laugh as loud as that of Bob
Dodson. ** It was a serious thing to get married —a
still more serious*thing not to get married, ” We
had heard that remark before. Then we enquired
“ Are you married ?”
Once more he laughed consumedly, and while
he did so we took stock of a big box on his table,
labelled, “ Braden’s Prepared Groats.” It was
full of, photographs. A prosaic, but withal a
domestic-looking receptacle for the shadows of
beauty in nitrate of silver.
“No,” he mirthfully replied. “I am not mar-
ried ; I am a bachelor, and shall no doubt die a
bachelor. ”
“Benedick,” we remarked, “hoped to die a
bachelor, and yet lived to see himself married.”
“Ah,” said the editor, “ I see too many ladies,
to fall in love with any of them. The man who
speaks to 40 women a day is always a safe man ;
he who only talks with a woman once a week or
once a month, goes off just like that ” —and he
snapped his fingers and gave a Ifmd “ click.”
We explained that it was not our intention to
“go off like that.” We were a newspaperman,
and had come to ask the favour of an interview.
He lowered his glasses and looked at us fixedly.
Yes, we wished to tell Australia all about the
editor of the Matrimonial News. It would be a
good advertisement for him.
He took the idea and after a while commenced
to talk. “I have been 3G years in business, and
I was in business 28 years before I started my
paper. I began in 1848, and since then tens of
thousands of people have been married through
me.”
“ Any in Australia?” we enquired.
“Yes; lots married in Australia. Several in
Sydney, including a member of Parliament, whom
I married in 1861. He is dead now, I think.”
“ Very probably,” we muttered.
“Oh, you needn’t put it in that way,” replied
the editor. “My marriages all turn out well.
Here (picking up the photo, of a determined-
looking woman with high-cheek bones and banged
hair) is a lady I married five years ago. Her
husband is dead, and now she has come back to
me for another. ”
“ Do you call that turning out well ? ’
“It shows, at any rate,’ replied the editor,
“ that she is satisfied-; —”
“ And what about him ?” we asked. )}
“ He doesn’t complain, poor fellow, at any rate,
observed the editor, with a chuckle. We had
heard that.joke before, also. “Here is a man
from New Guinea ”
[So it was—our old friend G .]
“ Well, he wants a wife. I have always on my
books six or eight thousand people.”
Then he took up another photograph. “ There
is a lovely girl. Now, isn’t she?”
It was a coloured picture, and she wore in her
hat the wing of a bird of paradise. She was
nine-and-twenty at least, and square-jawed. We
shook our head.
“ Well, some like her, others don’t. Here,
again, is the photo, of a girl I married seven years
ago. She went to Brazil. This is a cousin of the
Marquis of Huntly—l married her, too. Here is
a lady with £50,000” (she needed gilding)—“l
got her a husband the other day. Her sister mar-
ried Mr. Walter , of Australia, a man with
£70,000. Just look at this handsome woman,
under 40. She is anxious to marry again, or if
you like you can have her daughter, a pretty girl,
only 19. Yes, they all come to me, daughters and
mothers —I see 80 people a day.
We asked him which were the more numerous
—his male or his female clients.
“I have,”returned ho, “rather more men than
women. That, I think, arises from the men get-
ting hold of my paper very extensively. Here,”
lie continued, “ is the kind of man I often have
lie is a magistrate of the county of Somerset. I
married Hobart Pasha
“And the Baroness Burdett-Coutts ? ”
“No, lam telling you the truth,” he replied,
somewhat severely. ‘ ‘ Here is the Widow of a late
Chief Justice of Natal. She wants a husband.
Here is a clergyman ” (a bald-headed man with .a
monkey beard) —“I have great numbers of the
clergy. Here is a lovely French lady—how do
you like her? She is 28, and has one little girl
four years old. This is a surgeon-major, a country-
man of mine, from Inverness. He has just gone
out to India after signing an agreement with me.
lam to give him a wife with £20,000. Here is a
lady ” (we know her well) “ who is married to Mr.
J of Queensland. I have married her twice.
I have had lots from Sydney. Look at this. ”
And he showed us the photos, of two ladies as
well known in Sydney as the face of John Davies,
Esq., O.M.G.
“Now,” he went on, “ you see the photo, of a
pretty girl with £SOOO. ”
“ Why should she come to you for a husband ?”
“ I don’t know. The wide and immediate
choice I am able to offer seems to have a fascina-
tion for women. If you like, you can marry her
mother.”
“ Thank you, very much,” we humbly replied.
‘ ‘ Here is a lady whose father is High Sheriff of
the county of .”
“You say,” interrupted we, “that you see 80
people a day ?”
“ Yes, and I spend £SO a week in advertising,
outside my own paper. I work till one o’clock
every morning—10 hours a day, and only take one
meal, breakfast, if you overlook the fact that
before leaving the office I have a glass of wine and
a biscuit.”
Yes, it was quite plain—the old boy lived on
love.
“ Just look at that beautiful girl ! Comes to
me fiom Grosvenor-square. Did you ever see
such lovely hair ? Here is a solicitor who comes
to mo for the third time for a wife. I married
him in ’53, and again in ’63, and now, at the age
of 64, he asks for my help once more. That is an
absolute fact. His eldest son is a clergyman, 28
years of age, and I found a wife for him, too ; one
with money. Here is a lady, aged 45, who is
going to be married on the 15th of July. She has
£4OOO, and writes me a note. Listen :‘ My dear
sr, now that I am engaged to be married, do not
give my address to anyone else.’ Here, again, is
a clergyman, the son of a bishop, from whom I
had £IOOO. I married him to a lady with over
£20,000. You see, I charge 5 per cent, on the
lady’s property.”
A flood of light here burst in upon us. “You
don't take commission from both sides, do you?”
“ Oh, no; the party with most money pays as a
rule. Of course. I get my fixed advertised fees in
each case.”
It struck us that if both sides could be operated
on simultaneously, aN.S.W. run-appraiser’s billet
would be a mere circumstance alongside that of
the editor of the Matrimonial News.
“Let me show you a copy of the London Daily
Telegraph, containing an article headed ‘ \
Seen#: at a Wedding ’—in 1882, it was. A client
of mine, a Sheffield solicitor, was going to marry a
handsome widow I had found for him, with
£28,000. The parties were at the altar when the
bride’s brother came and loudly objected th e
wedding.”
“ On what ground ?”
“ Well, that was what the clergyman asked.
The lady’s brother said she was mad, and that her
sister had been in an asylum, whereupon the bride,
groom suggested that, as there appeared to be
madness in the family, perhaps the brother was
mad too. Which was a clincher, especially as my
client pulled out of his pocket a certificate he had
got from two leading doctors, testifying that his
intended wife was perfectly sane. So the wedding
proceeded. An account of it was in every paper
in the United Kingdom, and it brought me thou-
sands of customers ; it added £IOO a week to my
income for three months, for every man in Eng-
land seemed to think I could get him a wife with
£28,000.”
The old man now laughed till he had to hold his
sides.
“ It did me a lot of good,” he continued, “ and
was the best advertisement I ever had, notwith-
standing that in my life I’ve spent £50,000 in
advertising. Even the bridegroom’s sister came
to me for a husband a week afterwards.”
“What percentage of the applicants do yon
many? ”
“Well, I should say about 15 to 20 per cent.
There are always a lot of people you can’t marry
anyhow. Hundreds of the men cannot, it is plain
to me, keep a wife, and so I send them off about
their business. Sometimes you get an old woman
you can’t dispose of. But plenty of women with-
out a penny make splendid marriages—in fact, if
a woman is at all good-looking she usually comes
off best in the long run, so far as my office is con-
cerned, though I very frequently find a rich hus-
band for a woman with money.”
Here he turned up the loaves of one of a large
number of huge volumes bound in parchment, and
showed us a list of entries : £385 commission from
one man, £lO5 from another, £O3O from a third—”
“That is a New Zealand man !” we exclaimed.
“Yes, one of the richest wheat-growers and
sheep-farmers in Canterbury. I married him,
you see, six years ago. This is the photo, of the
step-daughter of a general officer, who comes to
me nearly every week, but he wants the young
lady—who, though very accomplished and rather
handsome, has no money—to marry a wealthy
man. Plenty of fathers and mothers consult me
as to marrying their children. Here is the widow
of a baronet ”
“ Very old,” we muttered.
“She isn’t very old,” replied the editor, wiping
his spectacles. “You see, she has £SOOO a year.
Plenty of people at GO get married like shots.' The
other day I married a lady of 22 to a man of 70
who settled £20,000 on her. One old lady of 68
came to me not long since and said : ‘ Yon have now-
had my application for two years. Are you not
going to get me married before you die? You
know you might die before I get a husband, and
then whatever should I do? She evidently didn’t
care what happened to me so long as I fixed her
up
* * #
But perhaps you’re tired, of this kind of
thing. We have seen men die of snakebite, and
we have seen a man stand in the witness-box for
three hours in a cold sweat and hear his beery
love-letters read out to a cruel world. Yet after
all we are of opinion that you can wish your bit-
terest enemy no greater curse than that he should be
married by the editor of the Matrimonial News
either to the fat woman with the seamy chin or
to the skinny hag with the reaping-hook nose—or
for the matter of that to any one or more of the
hundreds of dismal, leering creatures whose dirty,
much-fingered photographs are stacked in the
editorial groat-box.
Victorian Reporters’ Association has
adopted a badge of membership—a silver medid
bearing the name of the association and the word
“ Press ” in blue enamel. The badge is intended
as a speedy passport on public occasions. How-
ever, the most efficacious passport has ever been
silver without any blue enamel.
At a Melbourne shop-door hung until
lately a picture of the British “ Royal Family,” to
which was appended a placard bearing this legend
—“Meeting of the Unemployed.” But a seedy
swell came along who evidently knew that it was
raining in Lending, for his threadbare pants were
neatly rolled back from his battered boots. He
saw the placard, he read the inscription, and then
saying “ Ha ! doncherknow” to himself three
times, tore the offending cardboard into frag-
ments, on which he trampled violently ere walking
off with a virtuous look, mortally afraid the shop-
keeper was coming out.
About the maddest man on record is a
lawyer, who recovered costs in the District Court
last week. The judge awarded him 10s. in addition
to the verdict, but he stopped to argue the point,
and, after twenty minutes’discussion, he sud-
ceeded in getting £2 10s. allowed for legal charges.
Then he turned round to collect the amount from
his enemy, and found the defendant's attorney
sitting behind him with an expression of blissful
contentment on his face, while the defendant him-
self had vanished. He had fled through a side-
door the instant the verdict was retarded against
him, and no one in these parts has seen him since.
Cha’u.emont and Co., high art photographers,

A certain English lord, who had more

Spagnoletti : “I heard Ned Kelly, in the

people thought it prophesied a break out of gaol,
and visit to Sir Redmond’s. Everyone in court
heard this distinct saying of Kelly’s.”
Cardinals Newman and Manning were not
friends, and it was remarked that they never once
spoke while walking side by side in a sacred pro-
cession a year or two ago. The coolness dated
from a long time back, though they were, to some
extent, engaged together in the Tractarian move-
ment. Manning is a practical man, Newman was
not, and Pius IX never believed in him, but Leo
XIII did, wherefore the Cardinal’s hat came
along at once.
The Premier Permanent case was beautified
and adorned by a touching incident last week,
when one of the barristers engaged was so much
overcome by the thought of his client’s spotless
character that he had to adjourn his speech for a
few minutes and weep. When a lawyer has to
stop so that he may wail and splutter, the pressure
of pathos to the square inch is something tremen-
dous, and as his “refresher ” was going on all the
time, the incident was satisfactory to all parties
concerned.
Towards the close of the last French Em-
pire, Eug nie used to affect the utmost concern
about the hereditary and other antecedents of
ladies about to be presented at Court. She was
apprised one day of the marriage of a certain
Spanish Duke, an ex-assistant to a pharmaceutical
chemist, whom, for peace’ sake, Queen Isabella
had ennobled, and was asked to receive the lady.
“Who is this Duchess?” said Eugenie, to her
former liege lady. “There’s nothing to be ob-
jected to in her,” said Isabella. She’s rich, and i
hear that she’s the Pope’s daughter. One can’t
go higher than that.”
Hans Brandt, apprentice on a ship at
Hartlepool, fell down the hold lately and was
killed, when they found him to be a girl; which
revives a multitude of such cases. The most
remarkable is that of one Dr. Barry, quite an
eminent regimental surgeon at the Cape of Good
Hope, early in this century. He, that is to say
she, actually challenged an officer for calling her a
woman, but not till her death, well over middle
age, was the deception exposed. One such
deceiver had the front to marry a woman, and
they ultimately lived happily. This was at Ben-
digo, where the female-husband was a miner.
A Brighton (Vic.) bailiff, placed in posses-
sion of a house, in the process of recovering £6
10s., pulled to pieces the hud on which lay the
debtor’s wife, who f ell to the floor and prematurely

assault, but his defence that “he had a perfectly
legal right to seize the bed,” was upheld by a
bench of J VP.
A big Sydney syndicate has this week
started to bore for coal at Cremorue, Sydney,
about a couple of minutes’ distance from the chief
city wharf. A consensus of scientific opinions
points to the probability of coal being struck at
2700 feet, but failing such good fortune the bore
will if necessary be driven another thousand feet.
To work coal deposits at over 3000 feet seems
rather a large order, but the men interested are
quite confident that there is a big fortune to be
gpt out of operating on such far-down seams right
alongside deep wafer and within a stone-throw of
the city. They are so sure about the matter that
they have already sent to England specifications
for an enormously-]»owerful plant to be put in
hand on receipt of cable. They expect to start
their shaft within nine months from now.
The glove mania is spreading in Sydney.
In a swell locality may be seen any morning a
swell shoemaker, sweeping the pavement in front

At Brunswick (Vic.), a week or two ago,
a person named Males was fined £5 for selling a
bunch of carrots on a Sunday. As he hadn’t that
amount in the world he went to prison as the only
alternative, and left his wife, who was an invalid
and penniless, to live on raw turnips and the rest
of the stock-in-trade till he came out. Also about
the same time a man who bashed a stranger in the
street and tried to jump on his chest with both
feet, was charged 10s. ; and a person who was
fighting drunk and nearly wore out four police-
men, received a severe,caution. The law is not an
ass. It is a hytena.
One of the ruined colonists from the Ker-
madec Islands has petitioned N.Z. Parliament for
£B5O compensation, on the ground that the
Government had induced him by false representa-
tions to take up a run in that land of desolation
and slush and deluge. There was nothing meek or
humble in the petition, though, and he didn’t
wind-up by stating that ‘‘ he would ever pray.
There was an air of frank, ( unvarnished cursing
and dynamite in it instead;' and a sort of under-
lying insinuation that if the money wasn’t paid
someone would find himself lying dead at an early
date ; and the petitioner briefly intimated that if

velocity he would make the bill larger, and do

There are 21,000 parsons in England. Of
these, over 3000 have stipends lower in value than
£l5O yearly, and a movement is on foot to raise
money by subscription for the augmentation of
their incomes. Such a list ought to be carried
round only among the 18,000 who are more highly
paid, for the British public spends quite enough
church-money as it is. Surely the 34 bishops
who among them, beginning with Canterbury at
£15,000 and ending with Truro at £3OOO, earn, or.
rather grab, £lOB,OOO yearly, thus dragging in the
fishes and loaves (especially the loaf) at an average
rate of nearly £5OOO each-would be willing to do
something for the poor curates with lean wives,
threadbare clothes, and big families'. Should they
belie their profession as Christians by refusal, then
the law should compel them to relax their grip on
the shekels by a readjustment of church salaries.

POLITICAL POINTS
The Tasmanian Freetrade papers are fast
losing ground.
Bishop Moorhouse : “There are no leaders
in England now, only followers.
Now, watch England and Germany organ-
ising, their African Sepoys, and teaching the humble
nigger bayonet-exercise.
No politician who voted for a Chinese
Restriction Bill can afford to howl about the
iniquity of the “ boycott.
The present N.S.W. Government should
be known as the Pop-shop Ministry. They are
living on the interest of their pledges.
The North is represented in Queensland
Parliament by 16 members. Out of this number
the Separationist party reckon on securing at
least 12 or 13 seats.
The rebel Grenadiers are sent to the
Bermudas, but a batch of loyal ones is sent also,
to keep them from vnitrefaction ; whether the man
is loyal or not he goes to Bermuda.
Rev. Alex. Marshall, Melbourne Scots’
Church, says that “State secular education is
helping to build up an Australia of educated and
unprincipled scoundrels, the most dangerous class
in any community.”
Seven legal members -of the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council voted against Attorney Trickett’s
A CELESTIAL VIEW.
NEW CHUM: “IS THAT THE CLERGYMAN?"
OLD MAORI: “YES, THAT IS THE MISSIONARY, THE MAN WHO TELLS
THE MAORIS TO LOOK UP TO HEAVEN WHILE HE STEALS
THEIR LAND.”
Bill to amalgamate the profession. Any measure
which is voted against by seven lawyers must be
tolerably democratic.
Those N.S.W. legislators who are so fond
of boasting that they have “risen from the people”
should more soberly comport themselves. Other-
wise, it may be said of them that they have de-
scended from the people.
Addressing a meeting in London, says the
cable, Henry George said that the question of
Imperial Federation was out of the thoughts of
Australians. Their loyalty would not be worth
sixpence if subjected to any severe strain.
When boy-politician Caulfield was a pro-
tectionist the Sydney daily press declared that
his political speeches were “tirades of rubbish.”
Now that ho is a Foreign-trader he makes
“eloquent speeches’"and “ vigorously denounces ”
tnings.
Apropos of the proposal to allow Socialist
Rosa to address the Australian Natives, Purves,
Q.C., says, that while every latitude is to be given,
“the line must be drawn somewhere !” Why not
draw it at rich lawyers who refuse to hear the
other side? *
If a trades-union consisting of two people
of one trade is legal, then a trades-union consist-
ing of 100 people, or 50,000 people, of 100 different
trades is also legal. To logically dispute the
right of all trades to combine, Capital must begin
by denying the right of the members of any one
trade to combine.
When questioned, in the Lords, on the
Grenadier Guards’ strike, Premier Salisbury said :
“It is absurd to attach any significance to the
matter.” Just the same was said at the outbreak
of the American Civil War, of the French Revolu-
tion, of the U.S. War of Independence—and
everything else. Even the Australian Republic.
By 37 votes to 11 votes, the Members of
the N.Z. House of Representatives has affirmed
the principle of woman-suffrage. This, if imitated
by the other Parliaments of A ustralasia and carried
from the bare affirmation stage into afi'Act, would
soon settle various questions that now hang up,
like cocoons suspended in the breeze. The
“female compositor ” question, for instance.
It is all important to have Labour repre-
sented, in every Australian Parliament, at the
present juncture. In Victoria, the Conservative
Press Is always referring to Trenwith at? the repre
sentative of labour, with a kindly assumption thai
there ought to be just one representative in Barba
ment of two-thirds of the population. Trenwith
is a fine fellow, but not a labour man. Who la .
Unless the N.S.W. Opposition plays a
better game it will get Parliament dissolved before
the crafty Parkes has published his financial
policy—in other words, it will find itself before
the country with nothing to attack. Then Parkes
will get a big majority on general principles, in-
cluding the Yellow Pup, and will return to the
House and do just as he pleases for three years
more.
Salisbury’s answer in the Lords about the
Guards’ mutiny was as audacious as that of Cross
in the Commons, when he denied the accuracy of
the disclosure made beforehand, by Marvin, of
the Berlin Treaty. This took the gilt off the
gingerbread, by proving that Beaconsfield’s magni-
ficent Berlin triumph, “ Peace with Honour, was
settled in advance at London, with the Russian
ambassador.
No bowels of compassion have the banks,
some of whom appear to regard with the cold and
cruel eye of cynical indifference the prospect of a
death-grapple between the shearer and the
squatter. One or two of these institutions have
already informed squatters on whose stations
labour troubles have arisen that they will tolerate
no delay in the delivery of the wool over which
liens have been taken.
In the Victorian Assembly last week a wag
attempted to make Duncan Gillies blush by ask-
ing him whether he intended to question an Agk
statement that “ the object of the Government is
to retain its position by indirectly bribing
members of Parliament by bribing their con-
stituencies.” Duncan’s impenetrable hide main-
tained its normal leathern lint as he haughtily
replied—“ Too thin.”
One M‘Masters, writing in Melbourne
under the signature of f< Viator,” is the only pen-
man of the dailies who does justice to the Wharl
Sunday meetings, and, as usual, his articles appeal
in the most unlikely quarter. How ridiculous non
appear the, paltry efforts of the Harbor Trust to
stop these wharf meetings, which were thus only
advertised, and made more powerful engines for
the political education of the masses !
The Novoe Vremva, one of the foremost
Russian papers, reviews 1 Hike’s “Greaterßritain,
especially the part bearing on Russia in Asia, and
writes that the Russians will storm Herat soon.
The left arm reaches for Herat, _ thfv right _ for
Constantinople, and both work in harmonious
sympathy. England works up to Candahar, but
under tremendous engineering difficulties, as com-
pared with the easy Russian trip to Herat.
H. M. Stanley, freebooter, land-pirate,
and nigger-butcher in the name of God, continues
his denunciations of tho Germans for what he
calls their “monopolisinggreediness.” This im-
pudent brigand, whose best sponsor was a flour-
sack, quite loses sight of the fact that in de-
nouncing the Germans he emulates the vulture
who “denounced” the other vulture for picking
out the eyes of the traveller before he was dead.
The cry among some of the marine officers
who deserted their Association at the first scare
was, and is, well represented by the following
quotation from a letter published in the Argus
“ Surely the marine officers do not want to descend
in the social scale, and lower their status, which
they assuredly would do by allying themselves
with the labour organisations.” It is enough to
make philosophy’s self commit suicide to hear such
tommyrot talked in a country raised from nothing
—ay, from worse than nothing—raised from a
manufactured hell—and sustained by_ this very
labour which these porcelain dolts despise.
There is an unfinished law-suit on hand at
Adelaide. The Fire, Brigade there had a horse
which was too pensive and too much lost in
thought for galloping to conflagrations, so they
sold the animal on credit to an undertaker. Then
the beast brightened up and bolted with a car-
riage-load of bereaved mourners, and the under-
taker sent it back as being too irreverent for his
business, and the Fire Brigade sued him for
breach of contract. Unfortunately, however, the
fire-alarm rang just as the superintendent was
giving his evidence and he had to grasp his brass
helmet and run, and the position of that horse re-
mains an unsolved conundrum.
British justice is about as remarkable in
its way as the Australian article. A tattered
hawker was arrested some time ago in the streets
of London for having no visible means of support,
and a bank-book was found on him showing that
he had £2O to his credit. The book was promptly
confiscated, and Sir William Hardman sent him
up for six months. And now that his term has
expired the law has taken possession of his savings
to pay for his support in gaol during the period
which he spent there on a charge of having no
support at all, and when he wanted to know what
kind of a statute it' was which required him to
defray his board and lodging in person, and to
pay for being shut up and knocked about with a
bunch of keys, he was warned to clear out or
something worse might happen to him. Shades of
Scroggs and Jeffreys, where are you?
The Irish Monthly has a curious article
on the Mormons, by “ A Nun,” a counterblast to
that in the Atlantic Monthly in favour of
Polygamy, by Brigham Young’s daughter, Mrs.
Gates. The Nun reiterates the statement that
the Mormons never could get hold of Irish people,
and, of course, there is a beautiful, well-deserved
panegyric on the poor Gurrul of the Bogs in her
red cloak, as she takes off her shoes to walk to
Mass. We don’t know exactly how far the oft
repeated statement applies that the Mormons get
no Irish, but certainly the latter are remarkably
exceptional in the Mormon Rush. It is not that
“ No Irish Need Apply,” for the Long Hairs and
Beardies. are always struggling after them—so
says the “Nun ”in her own way. Disraeli
said, apropos of the Darwin Ape discussion, “ I
am on the side of the Angels.” So are we. The
little Nun is better than the blowsy Mrs. Gates.

The case of Florence Martin, convicted at
Sydney of bigamy and sentenced to but ten
minutes’ imprisonment, on account of the shocking
treatment to which she had been subjected by her
first husband, gives rise to an interesting question :
How does the unhappy woman now stand in rela-
tion to the divorce law? Having committed
bigamy, she cannot, wo presume, possibly get a
divorce from Mai tin, and any children she may
have by her present husband will thus be illegiti-
mate. Nor can Martin, after ill-treating his wife,
claim a divorce from her. How can Florence
Martin be placed in a position to free her from the
ban of the social law ?

Melbourne Age refuses to insert any more
“missing friend” advertisements of the assigna-
tion cla,-s, and when a bad young man planks
down his shilling and wants to tell his best girl,
per Age, to meet lim on Sunday next, a spasm of
holy horror passes through the establishment.
The bad young man’s only chance now is to try
Editor-parson Fitchett, the clerical organ further
up the street, with something like this: —“Dear
Eliza, —Meet me (D.V.) in time for choir-practice,
7.30, Saturday night.— Jedediah.”

Holy Shepherd’s advertisement, from the
Sy t dney Mokning Herald
T ADY HOUSEKEEPER (lady by BIRTH and EDU-
CATION, musical, and possessed of small private
means), required by a beneficed clergyman in N.S.W. ;
widower, without family ; man kept and woman occa-
sionally for rough work ; highest references given and
required. Address, LL.D., Herald office.
We wonder what this good pastor “requires”
the lady for? Perhaps he is acting on the general
principle that a nice woman with money is a
handy rhingto have on the premises. We wonder
also why he didn’t ask her to state her age, the
shape of her ankles, the condition of her com-
plexion, and her bust-measurement at once Oh,
you wicked !

Marine officers in the Australian coasting-
trade, unlike the sailors engaged therein, get no
overtime. The difference between the pay of
the third and fourth officers on one hand and
ordinary seamen on the other is at times
so great that the sailors’ wives could afford
to hire the officers’ wives to wash for them.
And all this for the glory of wearing brass
buttons ! The Bulletin does not for an instant
assert that the steamship-owners are making fat
dividends —on the contrary, it is perfectly aware
that steamship shares now generally mean some-
thing between 6 per cent, and insolvency. But
the fact remains that the men are well paid
because they have been able to combine, while
the officers are poorly paid because they have
had no effective backing from the iron hand of
Labour.

By securing the conviction for perjury of
M‘Minn, who imputed to him immoral conduct
with a lady-parishioner, Rev. G. H. Allnutt, of
Gobbi tty, N.S.W., has secured a complete and
effectual legal vindication of his character and that
of the lady maligned. The difficulties of obtain-
ing such a conviction are in all cases very great,
inasmuch as, notwithstanding what society may
say to the contrary, it is a cardinal rule among
manly men to commit perjury a thousand times
over rather than make any admission compromis-
ing a woman. When, therefore, a jury taking
into consideration, as they naturally would do,
the tendency of ordinary witnesses to withhold
the truth in such matters, find that M’Minu was
guilty of perjury, just as the jury in the civil case
for damages returned a similar verdict, it becomes
evident that Mr. Allnutt’s case must have been a
very convincing one indeed.

What sort of a funeral you get doesn’t
matter much, but there was a pathos about a poor
young sailor’s burial, in Williamstown, the other
day. He died on shipboard, and the captain came
ashore with the body, which he saw put in the
hearse, and then he returned to the ship again—
so that the young sailor went to the grave without
a single person following. Now if this was in a
novel, you would have the captain going home to
the poor lad’s mother- We did the best for him,
mann, and here’s a lock of his hair,” etc.

“Frou-Frou ” is a bitter satire on private
theatricals, for Valreas insinuates himself with
Frou-Frou through their rehearsing together. The
authors here touched a social sore. The average
man, such is the depravity of human nature, does
feel uncomfortable when ho sees his wife arfisti-
cally and platonically hauled about, and Valreas
is an awful scoundrel. Even if he were a Joseph,
it wouldn’t be nice.

Thus a Loudon paper :
A wealthy man appears in London, he knows no one, he
is the horny-handed son of toil, or the great farmer, or
the speculative entrepreneur. Howls his entrance into
the great world to be compassed ? It is easy enough.
London society, though monarchical in its government,
is republican in its views ; it asks no questions and is told
no lies ; it merely inquires if the aspirant to ts favours is
rich, and in that case the portals of its most secret
chambers fly open joyful y. One great lady takes the
new-comer in hand, issues invitations for a concert (as
being more uncommon than a ball), collects all her
friends, and the trick is done. Henceforth year by year
the millionaire’s position improves ; at first smart people
will only go to his balls and concerts, presently they con-
descend to accept dinners at his hands ; royalty next
expresses a wish to see a specimen of his famous cook's
performances; finally, the millionaire enters the precincts
of the royal palace ; then, indeed, the climax of his hap-
piness is reached. He may say with Sydney Smith’s
epicure, “ Fate cannot harm me,' I have dined to-day.”
All this is evidently for the benefit of Mr. Mount
Morgan Robertson.
A YOUTHFUL TUFA.
STRUGGLING JOURNALIST: “YOU MISCHIEVOUS YOUNG WRETCH !
THAT HAT COST 10/6, AND I HAVE TO WORK HARD FOR 10/6.”
STRUGGLING JOURNALISTS SON: “WHAT SORT OF WORK?”
S. J.: “THINKING!”
S. J. S.: “I’D THINK HARD FOR 10/6.”
Husband: “What a queer couple that is
at the second table back of you. He has read that
paper and hasn’t spoken a word to the lady with
him for twenty minutes.” Wife (with irony, as
her husband has done exactly the same thing):
“ Hasn’t he? Oh, well, I suppose she’s his wife.”

There are couples and couples. A man
who lunched the other day at one of Sydney’s
leading hotels, where alcoholic liquors are “ con-
spicuous by their absence,” except in bed-rooms,
heard a conversation between two waiters suffi-
cient to convince him that “love’s young dream”
has not in every case been superseded by devotion
to tne news of the day. Fir»t W after : “Them s a
new-married pair.” Second Waiter : “How do
you know?” First Waiter: “Their boots is
always put out at half-past seven.”

A picnic was recently given to the choristers
of St. Peter’s Cathedral, Adelaide. The bishop
and the cathedral organist took the boys to Oak-
hank, where games were played in which Ids
lordship participated. As the party left the scene
of the picnic they passed through the yard c.f the
well-known .Oakbank brewery, and the foreman
courteously offered samples of beer to the adults.
“ G. W. Adelaide,” in thanking the foreman, said
it was really very good beer, whereupon the fore-
man asked him if he had never tasted it before.
The bishop said he had not to his knowledge.
“Go on!” said the foreman; “mean to say* you
never knock round the pubs, at night?” He did not
recognise the bishop, who was dressed in flannels.
A certain wealthy young squatter whose
family name is talismanic w th the gentle Aus-
tralian barmaid from Cape York right down to
Cape Otway, hJs a station in Western Victoria,
and at shearing-time three seasons ago he wanted
the men to work under station rules, which they
declined to do and threatened to strike work.
The manager, having informed Mr. C what
had taken place, the latter came to the shed and
ordered all the men off the boards, remarking,
“I’d like to know who the ringleader of this
adjective push is, because if he’s a man I’d bo
glad to settle it outside the shed with him.” One
Billy Bradshaw hereupon said he was the cuss
and was quite willing to square the dispute in the
good old fashion. The shearers all egged Brad-
shaw on to have a slap at the boss, and in due
course a ring was formed arid the squatter and
shearer stripped to the waist. After several rounds
had been fought, the former called time and threw
up the sponge, saying that Bradshaw was the bes
adjective man he had ever met, and the best thing
he and his mates could do was to start shearing
again, and he would give them sixpence a hundred
over union rules.

The gigantic Australia Hotel, now rapidly
approaching completion in Castlereagh-street,
Sydney, is to be taken o> er by a limited liability
company. Granted good management, the Aus-
tralia will shut up several of the tomb-like
caravanserais still furnished with the chairs of 20
years ago, and infested by the ghosts of dead-and-
gone squatters. Many unencumbered people
already think of abandoning housekeeping and
taking apartments at the big place, the turn-over
at which will require to be enormous, as the mere
item of rent alone riiust represent about £13,000 a
year.

A Sydney sectarian paper asserts that
“ the money-offerings in a religious service widely
differ from the money taken at public concerts,”
because “the collection is part of the service of
the sanctuary.” Yes, alas! the collection is
always part of the service. Anyone who has wit-
nessed a service of which a collection did not form
part will please communicate with this office at
once. .Reward.

An English paper says that if people only
knew how bananas are ripened they would abjure
them for ever. The usual method of ripening
bananas in Sydney is for some fat Greek gentleman
to keep them under his b d a fortnight or so.
A Sydney society woman the other day
asked a sporting youth to take some tickets for
the Woman's Fund ball, which is being organised
as a sort of farewell to Lady(larington. “What’s

“Ah.” replied the fair ladye, “ we won’t go into

It has frequently been remarked how
closely a husband and wife come to resemble each
other after a long wedded life. A similar remark
seems to apply to actors and actresses after a long
period of professional association. Look at Irving
and Ellen Terry, for instance; and look at the
portraits of Mrs. Brown-Potter and Kyrle Bellow
in the shop windows !

Queer scene in a Melbourne school. Master
called up little Jimmy Butterfield, before all the
boys and girls, and Jimmy thought he was going
to get a prize, when the grim pedagogue said,
“ I’m told you’re the boy that falls in love with
the girls. We won’t have that nonsense here, d’ye
mind?” Two Melbourne-boys, one 14 years old,
committed suicide for love. One, for the"sake of a
pantomime fairy, flung himself under a railway
train; the other, a 16-year-old, suicided over
Emelie Melville.

The awful position of John Northcote, a
married Melbourne builder who trifled with the
affections of a barmaid and found himself brought
up for “breach” last week, was briefly, bluntly
and solemnly depicted by Townshend M’Dermott,
defendant’s barrister-at-law. The amorous John
had “merely done what was unfortunately too
common ” —pleaded Mac., who is quite old enough
to pass a valuable opinion on such matters—“ and
would be sufficiently punished by the tongue of a
virtuous and I’espectable wife.”" The argument
went straight to the soul of every married man in
court. What heavier damages than the tongue of
chaste matronhood could any barmaid wish to
inflict upon her faithless John ? (She got £5O in
addition to the other compensation.—Ed. B.) —
Sir Samuel Wilson, the most awful among
the band of “representative Australians” who
infest the Mother Country, is returning to the

“GILHOOLEY’S ESTATE.”
(A ballad concerning the amalgamation of the legal
professions.)
Oh, Mi - . Gilhooley he turned up his toes,
As most of us do, soon or late ;
And Jones was a lawyer, as everyone knows,
So they took him Gilhooley’s Estate.
Gilhooley in life had been living so free
’Twas thought his possess! ns were great,
So Jones, with a smile, says, “ There’s many a fee
For me in Gilhooley’s Estate.”
They made out a list of his property fine,
It totalled a thousand-and-eight;
But the debts were nine-hundred-and-ninety-and
nine—
The debts of Gilhooley's Estate.
So Mrs. Gilhooley says, “Jones, my dear man,
My childer have little to ait.:
Just keep the expenses as low as you can
Against poor Gilhooley’s Estate,
But Jones says, “ The will isn’t clear in its terms,
I fear it will need some debate,
And the law won't allow me (attorneys are worms)
To appear in Gilhooley’s Estate.”
So a barrister-man, with a wig on his head,
And a brief in his hand quite elate,
Went up to the Court where they bury the dead,
Just to move in Gilhooley’s Estate.
But his Honor the Judge said, “ I think that the
joint
Legatees must be called to \m\hotc —
Ex parte Pokehorney is clear on the point—
The point of Gilhooley’s Estate.
“ I order a suit to be brought just to try
If this is correct that I state —
A nice friendly suit, and the costs, bye-and-bye,
Must be borne by Gilhooley’s Estate.”
So Mrs. Gilhooley says, “Jones, you’ll appear !
Thim barristers’ fees is too great;
The suit is but friendly.” “ Attorneys, my dear,
Can’t be heard in Gilhooley’s Estate.”
From Barristers’ Court there’s a mighty hurrah
Arises both early and late :
It’s only the whoop of the Junior Bar
Dividing Gilhooley’s Estate.
THE BANJO.
VIRTUE'S VENGEANCE.
Poor builder, the advocate rightly
And pungently pleaded your case ;
Mo doubt Mrs. Northcote is nightly
Suffusing with blushes your face,
And slanging that barmaid until U !
’Neath blankets you bury your head,
And wake to discover the pillow
Quite wet with the tears you have shed.
The heart of the hub. who goes mashing,
Away from his home and his hearth,
Turns cold when the missis is flashing
Her eyes in connubial wrath ;
’Tis pleasant enough while you bluff her
With yarns Ananias would scorn,
But O ! when she “ tumbles ” you suffer,
And wish you had never been born.
Though sweet are the joys of Giovanni
(While still the “old woman” is blind)
As Hebe gives ear to his blarney,
And smileth the smile of her kind,
Yet bitter the gay dog’s repentance
When, sooner or later, his wife
Discovers his game, and the sentence
Is nag —for the rest of his life.
Poor builder, your advocate clearly
Explained the position of things ;
We pity your sorrows sincerely.
(Which “we” is the poet who sings.)
Alas ! foolish butterfly gadder,
More shrill than the note of a fife,
More sharp than the tooth of an adder
Is the tongue of a virtuous wife.
No Doll’s House, we guess, is your dwelling,
No Nora, you bet, will arrange
To fly from her husband and dwelling
Because she considers him “strange,”
Such wives don’t exist out of Norway.
Your bosom is bound to be wrung
By a matron who stands in the doorway
To give you the length of her tongue.
It ought to be plain to a jury,
And patent to judges as well,
That the taunt of a virtuous fury
Is ten degrees hotter than hell.
What odds to a golden-haired Tottie
Is the loss of a dissolute swain ?
If her rival is driving him “dotty ”
Miss Tot hasn’t suffered in vain.
A lecture you’d better prepare to
Sit out every morning and eve ;
Of the ills giddy husbands are heir to
There’s none to beat that , we believe.
You will deem the rash suicide happy
Whose end is a bullet or knife ;
Even Totth- will murmur, “ Poor chappie!”
As she thinks of the virtuous wife.

will arrive safely, but a person of his size and im-
portance ought to be unscrewed and sent along by
instalments in separate vessels so that the whole
of him coukln t well be lost simultaneously, and
to risk the entire quantity at one shot is a wilful
insult to Providence, if that vessel should go
down, it will be, the work of ages to grow another
Samuel to replace the one that is gone. The
reason of his return is not stated, but probably his
career as the lord of Hughenden Manor has been
a failure. He wasn’t able to take over the spirit
of Disraeli along with the property, and the ghosts
of his ancestors wouldn’t gibber on the battlements
worth a cent. The crusader, clad in mail, who
ought to have walked the corridors at midnight,
didn’t turn up, and when Samuel started to muse
among the tombs of his forefathers the thing fell
flat, for he looked so infernally new himself that
nobody would believe ho ever had any. When a
red-haired man is short and plain and fat, and has
a sort of ornery expression on his counten-
ance, it is difficult to live up to a long line of
buried foi’efathers.

Mrs. Stanley, the wife of the retired
nrigand who has lived for so many years on hope
and sand in the Dark Continent, claims to be a
descendant of Oliver Cromwell. Considering
Oliver’s incurable snuffle, and the way lie began
by talking' about liberty and ended by pounding
everybody who wanted a share of the article, and
taking into account that he brought up his son on
such a strict moral basis that he became three
parts an idiot, and making due allowances for his
massacres in Ireland, and for a disagreeable habit
he got into of selling his prisoners as slaves on the
American plantations, and reckoning in several
other trifles, it seems as if Stanley had married
into a thoroughly congenial family, and ought to
feel himself quite at home.

A Sydney man, who has a pleasant little
habit of making free with strangers in public, re-
ceived the surprise of his life the other day when,
with his usual good taste, he attempted in a bar to
make a butt of an inoffensive musician, better
known for the length of his hair than the weight
of his fist. When the funny man had got his hat
into shape, clapped a beefsteak on his eye, and
wrung the blood out of his nose, he began to
think that there might be something in the fable
of Samson and his locks after all.

The Age states that the dignity of a judge
in Chambers is such a serious affair that “no
solicitor would venture to take a chair in his pre-
sence.” We always imagined that a solicitor
would take any earthly object, except a live ser-
pent or a quantity of boiling lead, but there
appears to be one other article that is safe from
his rapacity. Perhaps the chair is nailed down to
the flooix

There is one thing which Minister Car-

Which is, that any boy who points the muzzle of a

vigorously kicked every time he does it.

The fund raised in Sydney at Jubilee time
to commemorate the 50th year of the reign of the
well-gilded individual known in the selectest circles
as the “Pre-eminent in Grief,” was originally
christened “The Queen’s Fund.” However, it
soon became plain that for collecting purposes the
“Woman’s Fund” was an ever so much better
title, and so the “ Woman’s Fund ” it became
accordingly. Now that Lady Carington is going
away, and the institution is to be used for a big
and fashionable ball, it bobs up again serenely as
“The Queen’s Fund.”

The most fascinating girl-movement at
lawn tennis is a sort of back-kick in smacking at
the ball, when they hop up and gyrate, with a
fish-hook effect, in snaring the susceptible. This
kick has been fatal to many a fine young fellow
swathed in flannel. We believe it is professionally
termed the Gyroscopic Ankle. There is a nautcll-
iike twist of the whole body, a corkscrew wrench,
at which young Mr. Green, with £15,000 a year,
foolishly applauds.

The more-or-less official announcement of
Toole’s “ engagement ” to Miss Effie Liston—an
engagement whose existence is uncertain—reminds
us that the late Mrs. T. was also an amiable lady
of very ample proportions, but was never an actress.
Roundabout.
A social function took place the other day
at a far-western hamlet, and for the time being a
spirit of joyous harmony lighted up the dull path
of existence, and the cares attendant on the present
low price of bullocks were extinguished. The hall
was tastefully decorated with tallow candles, and
an ounce and a half of hot grease fell into the eye
of the lady whose husband fell out of his cart last
year and broke his neck. There were about 120
people present, including an individual who was
Out on bail on some absurd question relating to a
horse, and not forgetting a maiden six feet hi h
who wore about three-quarters of an emu in her
hat. This blushing creature was of a bashful
turn, and was with difficulty ejected from the
ladies' retiring-room, where she wanted to stay all
the evening; but she recovered her spirits later
on, and threw her feet about so energetically in
the first waltz that they arrived unexpectedly in
the back of anybody who happened to be
near. The only mishap of the even ng arose
through the fact that a girl from Simpson's
Crossing had brought a piece of a dismantled
cruet with her as a scent-bottle, She was a pro-
longed and shadowy creature, and was, unhappily,
in profound ignorance of the fact that someone
had filled up the bottle with ammonia, but when
she took a liberal sniff of the mixture the circum-
stance dawned on her. Then she opened her
mouth in agony till all that could be t-eeii of her
was a portentous cavity surrounded by an almost
imperceptible fringe of girl, and uttered a shriek
that sounded as if a fire bad broken out in per-
dition and all the devils were rusting for the door.
When she had partially reeove’ ed she commenced
to canter round the room at the rate of a long dis-
tance in a very short time, but she was captured
after a brief but exciting struggle and led out into
the open air, where some kindly friends stood her
up against the wall. Her partner suspected that
this outrage had been perpetrated by a gen-
tleman without a coat and with a badly-bayed
collar, and he accordingly knocked him backwards

over the barrel of beer in the refreshment-
room. The provisions were all that could be
desired, except that a candle had dropped out of a
bracket into the tea and completely dissolved, but
the wick being discovered suspicions were aroused
before more than three-fourths of the article had
been assimilated. The proceedings came to an
end about 2 a.m., and the company dispersed un-
conscious of the fact that a gentleman connected
with the post-and-raii fence industry had been left
asleep under the table and locked in. When he
woke, however, he made his escape by wrenching
the door off its hinges, after having accidentally
smashed four windows, and about daylight two
horses and a lost pig entered through the opening
thus provided and finished up the remnants of the
supper. The proceedings were a great success in
every respect.

Any person who tliirsts after knowledge
can be abundantly supplied at Orange (N.S.W.),
where about five tons of literature are lying in
the gutter. Some two years ago an affable hawk
visited the town to collect information for a work
on the greatest men in the whole earth, and it
proved on investigation that the population of
Orange consisted almost entirely of great men,
and every stupendous intellect in the place
arranged to have his biography inserted, and to
take one or more copies. There was a consider-
able sameness about these biographies, however,
and most of them consisted of a bald narrative to
the effect that Thomas Jones, of Dead Hor c
Creek, was the son of old Jones, of the same
place, and that up to the age of 40 years he had
shown no particular evidences of genius, and had
continued that way ever since. Also, he farmed
480 acres of arable land, and was the father of a
large, bare-footed girl through his marriage
with Mary Ann Smith. The biographer
tried his best to cast a glamour of romance
over these naked facts, but the scheme fell
through miserably, and now everybody de-
clines to accept or pay for the volume on the
greatest men in the whole earth, and the agent is
delivering it at the hazard of his life. Generally
he has to bang the stupendous literary effort down
on the verandah and then fly for his existence,
while the recipient rushes out and hurls the book
after him, and then pursues him with dreadful
execrations and a gun. The town of Orange is
filled with books and dogs and guns and profanity
and placarded all over with notices that book-
agents will have boiling-water thrown at them,
and be shot afterwards and buried in unconse-
orated ground, and there is consternation every-
where. But the one point on which everybody is
agreed is that the agent will have to climb over
the subscriber’s d ad body to get the money ; and
if he recovers a verdict in the local courts and all
appeals prove to be useless, then, as a last re-
source, Orange intends to hoist the flag of insur-
rection and throw up entrenchmen s and defend
its liberties with bricks and pit> liforks and garden
implements, and a provisional constitution will be
established, the'basis of which will be that the
new republic will swim in blood before it will pay
for that thrice-infernal volume either in this world
or in the next.

There is a live nobleman living in a humble
sort of way in Melbourne, and apparently he lias
been changing to new quarters lately, for a cartage
firm now publishes a standing advertisement to
the effect that “ Lord Blank desires to state that
he is extremely satisfied with the way his furniture
was removed, and the charges were very moderate.”
We. would point out that if his lordship had
shifted his own tilings unobtrusive’y in the dark
the charges would have been still more moderate,
and a good deal of invigorating exercise would
have been thrown in. The present writer adopted
that system frequently in his younger days, and,
except on one occasion, when he undertook to
move the stove a distance of three miles on hi.i
back, and get it up two flights of stairs, he never
was any the worse. Provided Lord Blank doesn’t
gallop recklessly down the strict wheeling two
bedsteads and a sofa in a barrow, and is careful
not to fall backwards when he is toiling up to the
third storey with the chest of d aw rs in his
arms and the wash-basin on his head, he will
lie all right ; also it is important that ho
shouldn’t j ump too enthusiastically along a crowded
thoroughfare when he has got his hands full of
buckets and things, and is carrying the garden
rake in his teeth, else lie may be surprised after a
while to find that he is carrying away an eye on
one of the prongs of the implement. He will
probably discover, by and bye, that there are 116
ways of fixing up a bedstead, and that they are
always wrong ways and provocative of strong
language and du-t, and he may be inclined to re-
pine when he is falling downhill with a feather-
bed and a tin of keresone, and knows that the
family is overtaking him rapidly accompanied by
the axe and the dust-box and the frying-pan, but
he should boar up against these difficulties and
overcome them. The writer of tins generally lets
Ids fat aunt get in front with the feather-bed.

A gigantic poorhouse, endowed by a local
resident was opened lately at Auckland (N.Z.),
amid much snuffle and congratulation. A parson
named Reed in particular was taken with a bad
fit of loyal rejoicing, and in the course of Ids re-
marks he said that “His Excellency must be
gratified to find that the institutions for which
the Home Country is so celebrated are taking
root here, and ho hoped they would flourish.”
Which means, if language amounts to anything,
that his Excellency is glad to see the grand old
workhouse taking root and wants the glorious old
pauper to flourish in the land because that shoeless
mendicant is one of the symbols of England’s
greatness, and is anxious that the parochial beadle
should increase and multiply, and become abund-
ant in the new countries beneath the Southern
Cross. Also ho yearns that the gruel and the
skilly may become a part of the national existence,
and may spread like a green bay-tree; and he
wants the casual ward to grow into a great in-
stitution in order that the toothless cripple may
always be able to break stones before breakfast,
and bless the squire and all Ins relations. And
then another parson rose and pointed out that
under the enlightened policy of the Christian
Anglo-Saxon there was always a mouldy crust
open to the aged, and a plank bed for the infirm,
and that the man who was overtaken by sickness or
calamity would find a partially decayed vegetable
at his disposal provided he grovelled in the proper
quarter. Some religions, he added, taught the
degraded heathen to assassinate the helpless and
the aged, and put them out of their misery, but
the civilised white man abhorred such tilings.
We are now looking for the tomb of the man who
founded that “ religion ” which suggests that it is
better to kill the old mendicant than to put him
in a poorhouse; find when we have found it we,
intend to go to the expense of a tombstone, with
an inscription setting forth that a square heathen
lies below, and that he was a merciful and upright
idolater, and an honourable pagan who loved his
fellow-creatures, and of such is the kingdom of
heaven. Further we will give that lost barbarian
a eulogistic notice in The Bulletin as soon as we
have traced his history; and if his descendants
can be found we would suggert that they receive
some mark of public esteem as being connected,
however remotely, with a noble philanthropist,
whose name we trust will be held in reverence for
ages after the last beadle and Board of Guardians,
are extinct, and the final benevolent committee
and charity organisation society have been thrown
into the sea.

Fifteen gentlemen assembled and had a “ jam-

consumed 87 bottles of lage -beer and six bottles
of whisky. Anyone who is astonished at so small
a performance can never have visited a German
club.
A fat and semi-divorced opera-singer, who
wants to marry her business-manager, had a bad
experience recently in an Australian city. She
had the wedding-feast prepared, the guests in-
vited and the wedding-gown laid out, when—
behold ! there occurred a hitch in the divorce-
papers, and the whole entertainment fell through
with a hollow sound. The guests rose nobly to the
occasion, however, and wolfed the breakfast all
the samp.
We notice with pleasure that the Equitable
Mortgage, Discount, and Deposit Bank, of 4
Moore-street, Sydney, has recently been incor-
porated, and is now opened for business. This
bank has been formed for the purpose of assisting
those who may at any time be in pecuniary diffi-
culties and wish to avoid paying the excessive in-
terest which is too often charged. The bank has
secured the able services of Mr. Henry A. Birk-
myre, which should be a guarantee that clients will
be fairly dealt with. In these days of extortion, the.
above institution should about fill a long-felt
want. *
A publican at Bacchus Marsh (Vic.) has
been fined because he refused to supply bed and
board at the customary rates to Miss H elen Hart,
a massive lady clamped with iron, who lectures
on the “Sphere of Woman.” Whether it was
Miss Hart’s appetite that scared him, or whether
it was the hostile expression of her / ye, the defen-
dant did not state, but apparently he felt it would
be cheaper to be fined than to h- ■ -the lady in the
house. Possibly he was righ . We travelled
once on board a Union steamer with a lady-
lecturer, and she was the most 'expensive
person who ever came on board. Her strong point
was a mysterious “sphere” which the soul was
alleged to enter by a Hidden Way, and when once
it got in the present became non-existent and the
past was obliterated, and the future assumed a
new aspect which was not very well-defined ; and
all ordinary mortal existence ceased, and indivi-
duality was extinguished, and the individual
who had passed the threshold became
filled with mystic gifts and cognisances, and
the price of tickets was 2s. fid. And in the
course of a six days’ voyage this ethereal creature
ate everything on board except the deck and the
mainmast, and manifested a complete acquaintance
with every Act of Parliament that was ever
passed under which a lone female could recover
damages on any earthly pretence whatever. But
at last when it became evident that between eat-
ing and actions for damages she was likelydo own
the whole ship within a fortnight the captain re-
solved to give her the slip, and he steamed out of
Wellington harbour an hour ahead of time, and
left her desolate on the shore. At least we all
supposed that she was left desolate, but she fol-
lowed in a special steamer, and overtook our
vessel at Gisborne, and charged the special
steamer to the company, and the latter proceed-
ings of that female were worse than the first.

An Imperial Rescript.*
Now this is the tale of the Council the German
Kaiser decreed,
To ease the strong of their burden, to help the
weak in their need.
He sent a word to the people, who struggle, and
pant, and sweat,
That the straw might be counted fairly and the
tally of bricks be set.
The Lords of their Hands assembled; from the
East and the West they drew —
Baltimore, Lille, and Essen, Brummagem, Clyde,
and Crewe.
And some were black from the furnace, and some
were brown from the soil,
And some were blue from the dye-vat; but all
were wearied of toil.
And the young King said, “I have found it, the
road to the rest ye seek :
The strong shall wait for the weary, the hale shall
halt for the weak ;
With the even tramp of an army where no man
breaks from the line,
Ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of
brotherhood —sign: ”
The paper lay on the table, the strong heads
bowed thereby,
And a wail went up from the people : “ Aye, sign-
give rest, for wc die ! ”
A hand was stretched to the goose-quill, a fist was
cramped to scrawl,
When—the laugh ot a blue-eyed maiden ran cleat
through the council-hall.
And each one heard Her laughing as each one saw
Her plain—
Saidie, Mirth, or Olga, Gretchen, or Mary Jane.
And the Spirit of Man that is in him to the light
of the vision woke ;
And the men drew back from the paper, as a
Yankee delegate spoke:
“ There’s a girl in Jersey City who works on the
telephone;
We’re going to hitch our horses and dig for a
h .use of our own,
With gas and water connections, and steam-heat
through to the top ;
And, W. Hoheuzollern, I guess I must work till I
drop.”
And an English delegate thundered : “ The weak
an’ the lame bo bio wed !
I’ve a berth in the Sou’-West work-shops, a home
in the Wandsworth Road ;
And, till the ’sociation has footed my buryin’ bill,
1 work for the kids an’ the missus. Pull up ? I’ll
be damned if I will!”
And over the German benches the bearded whisper
ran —
‘‘ Lager, der girls, und der dollars, dey makes ot
dey breaks a man.
If Schmitt haf collared der dollars, he collars dei
girl deremit;
But if Schmitt bust in der pizness, we collars dei
girl from Schmitt.”
They passed one resolution: “ Your sub-committee
believe
You can lighten the curse of Adam when you’ve
lightened the curse of Eve.
But till we arc built like angels, with hammer and
chisel and pen,
We will work for ourself and a woman, forever
and ever, amen.”
Now this is the tale of the Council the German
Kaiser held —
The day that they Razored the Grindstones, the
day that the Cat was Belled,
The day of the Figs from Thistles, the day of the
Twisted Sands,
The day when the laugh of a maiden made light of
the Lords of Their Hands.
—Rudyard Kipling,
*We print the above as a sample of good verse, not be-
cause we approve of its individualistic teachings. The
reply to Mr. Kipling’s arguments is very easy. The man
who works after-hours because he has a wife in esse or in
pvsse works twice as much in his employer’s interests as
in his own and her’s, and dead in the teeth of communal
interests under existing conditions. We want co-opera-
tion, not merely of men, hut of mankind, of men and
women—their interests are one, and their course is ob-
vious.— Ed. B.
M'Leod, doctor and preacher, now in
Darlinghurst prison undergoing a sentence of
three years for bigamy, has appealed to the Privy
Council. The appeal to the N.S.W. Supreme
Court was heard on 4th July last, when the Chief
Justice and Sir George Innes (Judge Windeyer
dissenting) upheld the conviction, but for different
reasons. The Bulletin predicts that Judge
Windeyer’s opinion will ultimately prevail against
that of the majority of the Full Court.
Governor Kintore has refused to grant the
Cockburn Government a dissolution. The position
is a peculiar one. The Ministry was defeated on
the Progressive Land Tax. Had they asked for a
dissolution then, it would almost certainly have
been granted. Subsequently Playford tabled a
motion of no confidence on general grounds—so it
is alleged—which was carried, but it is undoubt-
edly true that the Progressive Land Tax policy
decided the later voting as much as the former.
The point now is—Was Kintore justified in over-
riding his Cabinet ? It is stated that the Governor
consulted one of the judges. If he consulted
Chief Justice Way, then he consulted a man who
is financially interested in the Progressive Land
Tax Question to an enormous extent, as it would
touch him heavily were it carried through Parlia-
ment. Kintore has taken considerable responsi-
bility on his shoulders in going against his
Ministry.

Not loll" since the N.S.W. Treasury was drawn
upon for a Registrar-General, in the person of “ Charley ”
i'lnhey, and now its resources have been further taxed by
the withdrawal of P. .1. Holdsworth, poet, cashier, and
man of fashion, who goes as Secretary to the recently-
constructed Forestry Department. No longer will the
guileless publican have the chance on the 30th of June of
ringing in the rupee and the Bank of England note upon
the wary Joseph. “ Joe's ”... weaknesses are epigrams and
ample frock-coats of gorgeous pattern. A tradition is
extant at the Treasury that one day “Joe” was passing
punch’s Hotel when he became inspired with a more or
less poetical idea, and fearful lest it should escape his
memory he stopped dead and took out his note-book to
iot it down. The book and the big check-pattern d;d the
trick, and P.J. was horrified by a query from one of the
unwashed as to “ what price he was laying the two Grand
Flaneurs?”
* * *
The Dawson-Maber fight for the 1 igl it weigh t-
ohampionship—or rather, the first event of the trials
to find the champion—proved a manly give-and-take
contest from the first to the twentieth round, when
Maher was beaten, more from exhaustion than the actual
punishment he received. Maher’s exhibition showed him
to be entirely devoid of ring cunning, and the writer
cannot hut think that if he had had a smart second, the
battle would have had a different termination. He never
from first to last made any attempt to fight at Dawson’s
body, and as the latter is clever at stopping, it was a
simple matter for him to stop Maher’s blows, which he
knew would go for the head. Dawson is a fair, manly
boxer, and a great favourite with the crowd, but as the
ironbark man, Burge, fought a draw with him, and a
lightweight such as “Dummy ” Mace stands in his way,
itreally seems premature to dub him champion. The
writer in all faith believes “Billy” Murphy could give
either Dawson or Maher their weight in and a drubbing,
and should “Jack” Hall, now in Melbourne, think it
worth while to get rid of his aldermanic proportions, he
ought to he able to thrash the pair before breakfast one
morning, just to give him an appetite.

At last the Australian scullers see the error of
their ways, and are going to the States to rake-in some of
the Yankee dollars which have been waiting for them so
many years. Kemp and O’Connor are to row in America
for £5OO aside and the championship next March. The
exact spot of venue is not decided, but we won’t charge
Mr. Deeble anything for the suggestion that tenders
should be called in America from the owners of the many
three-miles-with-a-turn courses, and we’ll guarantee the
highest tender will not fall far short of 10,000 dollars.
* # *
The most amusing sporting statement which
ever saw light came out last week when the papers
announced that Kemp and Stanbury, under the auspices
of the N.S.W. Rowing Association, are going to row two
miles on the Parramatta, “just to show the public which
is the better man.” Deeble, Kemp, and Stanbury are
bound on an American trip, but it seems they are getting
their hands in at the showman business before starting.
Ye gods ! the astute “ Johnny ” Deeble going to show his
hand for “nix” to the general puhlic! It makes us smile.
* * *
“Billy” K , the well-known racing man,
and his chum “ Jack,” many years ago when travelling by
rail to and from country meetings, used to keep a carriage
to themselves in a very simple manner. Should a stranger
attempt to enter “Jack” would feign a fit, and K
would cry out “ in the name of Heaven for some one to
come and help hold him down.” The game worked for a
long time, but at last the pitcher was taken once too
often to the well. At Campbelltown, one night, a big
lump of a fellow was seen approaching the door, when
“ Jack” went off into a superb fit. The newcomer hap-
pened to be a Sydney detective, who nearly choked Tohn
ere explanations could be made.
# # #
Kemp’s readiness now to row O’Connor in
America, and thus risk the loss of the championship,
shows how worthless were the quibbles raised by “the
stable” until they found that O’Connor was not good
enough for Stanbury.

It seems we, in Australia, have been “ barking

able exhibition was caused through over- training, and that
both Narellan and Kirkham are now cripples.

The Australian cricketer at “home,” when
batting the day after a banquet, sees two balls (at least)
approaching. One is dead on the wicket. He smites at
the other, and then sees four bails flying about, two
wicket-keepers biting their gloves and looking the other
way, two prostrate and two erect stumps. Then he retires
to two pavilions, makes twenty-two excuses, and another
cable about bad luck and wet wickets is despatched. The
Australian always plays on a “wet” wicket after a
banquet.
* # *
It seems that Slavin refused to give an exhibi-
bition-spar in one of the English provincial towns
because he discovered, on his arrival, that the advance-
agent hadn’t billed him as much as he (Slavin) could
desire. Some of the papers snorted considerably at
Slavin’s original refusal to meet M’Auliffe on the ground
that the American giant “ wasn’t class enough.” Tom
Sayers and Co., it is remarked, were not too high-and-
mighty to take on a soft thing, when the soft thing was
ready to pay handsomely for being slaughtered. Slavin
might try to cultivate a little of the humble spirit of
scullerßubear, who came over here with the professed in-
tention of prospecting for somebody he could lick.
# * *
It is cabled that Lawrence Zucker, the well-
known Australian bookmaker, has died in England, of
brain-paralysis. He began business ns loblolly boy in
Barnard's tobacconist shop, Bourke-street, Melbourne,
when they used to do so much in list-betting. Gradually
he bloomed into a bookmaker, and became rich, but was
obviously not himself at last Cup, when he plunged
against Bravo, and his heart was broken. He will be
longest remembered for his V.R.O. disqualification ovei
the Newminster alleged “nobbling" business.

The three strongest supporters of long-distance
racing in England are Mr. W. G. Craven, Sir John Astley,

unluckiest racing men on the English turf.
* # #
The hard-headed “ Pendragon,” writing of the
second Slanbury-O’Connor boat-race, says that after all
chivalry is not dead among professional scullers, and also
that it is pleasant to set Stanbury’s act in contrast to
“ the blowing and the gas which in Australia go, as a rule,
hand-in-hand with—not incompetency and dufferism, as
with us, but with real right-down first-chop talent, courage
and ability. According to such telegrams as have been
received here, it appears as though Stan bury, finding
O’Connor was dissatisfied with the result of the first race,
gave him another all in for the same stake as they had
rowed for before ; an act which has no parallel in this or
(so far as is known) in any other country.” Then, after
viewing the question with wonderful clearness, consider-
ing the meagreness of his information, he asks, “What
should we have thought of Kelly if, after a race with
Chambers, in which ‘hand awa’ Bob ’ was beaten, and of
course, angry and aggrieved, the Southoountryman had
said, ‘ Well, to prove to you I am the better man, and no
flies, I won’t reckon I’ve won this race ; we’ll regard it as
a dead-heat, and come out to-morrow or the day after and
row off the decider ?’ ” Or, he remarks, what of Elliott
and Boyd if they had thus settled their disputes, or of
Hanlan if he had thus given Trickett a second go for the
same stake once more'? lie might have said something
of Sadler and Kelly, who had a lengthy lawsuit over a
hundred pound stake, but forgetting that, states; “ Why,
we should have thought, in any one of these instances,
that the man who t hus risked what he had already won,
and ought to put in his pocket, was stark, staring mad,
and only fit to be placed under control of an asylum’s
authorities.” Scarcely satisfied with heaping all this jam
on the unaccustomed Australian, he then administers a
slight corrective, and dismisses the quixotic and high-
class sculler to go for Slavin, the boxer, “who has shown
himself a fairly good man—how good we cannot tell,
seeing the lack of force there has been in the trying tackle
hitherto obtained tor him ; but no one will say he has
shown any readiness to give points away or do any one
thing that might by the most optimistic be regarded as
generous, That Slavin is a brave man is absolutely
without doubt; if we had not received good proof of this,
we might have supposed after the Bruges affair that it
was Slavin, and not Smith, who stood forth as champion
empty braggart. For it must be confessed Slavin did not
bear his blushing honours at all modestly; quite other.
He seems to me to live for the purpose of practically up-
setting the popular belief that all men w r ho bounce are
only of the windbag sort, and that when such men parade
they are only covering up their cowardice. Slavin, as I
have said, has shown us he has pluck, but he has also
shown us he can blow like fort} 7 .”

Sculler O’Connor, who was banqueted the other
day by some rowing friends, was picniced down the har-
bour on Saturday last by Mr. and Mrs. Frank Coffee as a
sort of hon voyage. A certain great and illoquint politi-
cian was for some unaccountable reason absent on both
occasions ; however, no one w ill for a moment imagine
that it was because he is only the friend of the successful
man. Just before leaving by the Austral for London, the
Canadian was handed a gold watch by Mr. Toohey,
M.L.A., on behalf of his Australian friends, and was
cheered loudly by a large assemblage as the steamer cast
off from the wharf.

Neil Matterson had a second winning turn on
Monday last, .when he defeated his quondam pupil, C.
Stephenson, of New Zealand, for a stake of £2OO, by four
lengths, over the champion course, in 20 minutes 57
seconds, with wind and tide favourable. Neil is now
matched against Chris. Neilson, the conqueror of the Tas-
manian Stephenson, for £2OO aside, to row over the cham-
oionship course in five weeks.
* # #
The result of Chris. Neilsen’s race with H. A.
Stephenson, the Tasmanian champion, over a three-mile
course on the Mersey, with the tide running out at the
rate of five miles an hour, was never in doubt, except
wdien the little fellow lost three lengths through an eddy
carrying him in shore. Stephenson, who is 27 years of
age," sft. llin. in height, and weighed only lOst. 61b., says
he’ll never row again. He is certainly rather lightly
built for the game. Neilsen is three inches shorter, but
six pounds heavier, and rowed in a four pounds lighter
boat.

One reason for the yearly increasing strength of
the “fields” in big handicap races is, that owmers are
bribed to start cripples on the off-chance by the holders of
their mokes’ names in big sweeps. Thus Clements, the
great Sydney “ Tonic ” man, has entered a crook of some
kind or other for this year’s Cup, probably for purely
advertising purposes, and the man who gets “ Clements’
Tonic ” in the big Consultations will negotiate with
Clements for a start. If Clements wants to get a real ad.
for his money, let him hire a draught stallion, a saddle,
and a 28-stoiie jockey to appear at the starting-post.

Yalpunga is a small town near the S.W. corner
of Queensland, with the usual hqte!, store and black-
smith’s shop. Once a year, when races are held, it can be
likened to nothing but a “ small hell on earth.” The
handicappers at the last races were two cripples, one
being lame and the other, whose usual cognomen is
“ Wingy Dick,” having only one arm. One jockey was
very wroth about the weight put on his horse, and imme-
diately began to hunt for the unfortunate handicappers,
promising to leave them in such a state that their own
mothers wouldn’t know them. On the offenders being
pointed out to him he exclaimed, in accents of disgust,
“Oh! h— 1 They’re afraid to have men as handicappers.
These are only halves ! I’d have been satisfied if I could
have punched them.”

A ’Frisco man asseyts that John D. Spreckels,
the clever amateur boxer, who has so persistently backed
Jimmy Carroll, and who lost 5000dols. over the M’Auliffe
fight, can use up “Bob” Fitzsimmons with the gloves.
He says: “That slender amateur, who was an invalid
before ho took up athletics, just walked away with him.
He led and landed at will, ducked all of Fitz.’s leads, and
countered until he had the Australian silly, and showed a
knowledge of ring tactics and a number of the tricks of
boxing that simply astonished me. That Australian was
simply paralysed, and swore he had never seen a boxer
before.” Perhaps Pitz. was “ kidding,” but more probably
amateur is a good sort and takes newspaper
pinß in exchange for champagne suppers and cigars. We
want to see Spreckels fight Fitzsimmons after basely
alienating the affection of the latter’s best girl.

Mr. Goodyear, who is to pick the intercolonial
eight this year, wants to order a boat from Edwards, of
Melbourne. Leaving other builders out of the question,
a place which can boast a “Joe” Donnelly need not go
further afield, and the win should be for a N.S. Wales
boat as well as crew. However, as the crew has not yet
been picked for the race, which is to come off in November,
they might as well row in a dug-out as a racing-craft, for
they would have as much show of winning in one as the
other. The University eight should have been kept to-
gether to represent the colony.

on the same ship worth two or three thousand pounds, it
is said. A ’Frisco authority, admitting his gameness and
wonderful hitting power, says that if “ Ike Weir’s hands
were sound he could trounce two Murphys in one ring.
He was compelled to fight Billy here with a bullet wound
through one of his fingers, and even thus handicapped he
made a monkey, a holy show, and a punching bag of the
‘Australian wonder,’ until his hands became so sore he
could no longer use them. Then, finding that Murphy
was comparatively strong and fresh, and that if he con-
tinued the struggle he was in for a first-class hiding, he
took advantage of the first punch in the stomach that he
received to go to the floor and double up like a jacknife.
He wasn’t out, but he could fight no more. This was
strictly true, for his hands were tlseless and he wasn’t in
the mood to let himself become a ohopping-blook, and so
he lets his seconds cry ‘peccavi’ for him. When the
affair was over, to save his reputation he quietly gave out
that the affair was a cross and that he had received
5000dol for losing.”

The totalisator will, in all probability, be soon
legalised in Victoria. Hitherto it has been blocked by the
influence which the big bookmakers exercised over both
branches of the legislature. The two leading bookmakers
arc now in England, but in any case the “ Leviathan ”,
does not now oppose the “ tote,” which is certain to kill
his form dable rival, the “ Toerag Tommy,” orsmall book-
maker. The infernal machine can never affect the big
fielder, for owners and commissioners will always find it
necessary to get on their money at a stipulated price,
which the totalisator could never guarantee. But it would
kill the vampires, who are now sucking the life-blood of
sport.

The second test-match between England and
Australia, played at Kennington Oval on a wet and sticky
wicket, was won by the former country by two wickets.
Australia scored 92 and 102 (Trott made 39 and 25), and
England put up 100 and 95. In the Leyton match with
Cambridge University, Past and Present, the Australians,
apparently right out of it on the first innings, were
deprived of a win by time only. The scores were—
Australia, 218 and 356 for 6 wickets (Murdoch 129 and 30,
Trott 38 and 186, Blackham 66); Cambridge, 389 and 78
for 8 wickets. The Portsmouth match with Oxford and
Cambridge, Past and Present, was also drawn, the
Universities scoring 233 and 112 for 2 wickets, and Austra-
lians 131 and 300 for 5 wickets. In the University matches
the Australians took advantage of the new rules to close
their innings on the last day.

A Caulfield trainer, on being arrested or. a
charge of borrowing money upon his employer’s horses,
told the detectives that Sir Wilfred would win the Caul-
field G.N. Steeple on the following day. Melbourne
Herald published the tip in its police-news, and, as it
came from a trainer, Sir Wilfred was a bit rushed that
night. He went out at 10 to 1 next day and won easily.
» * *
The omission of Attewell, Peel, and Briggs from
the last All England Eleven suggests not only that the
Britishers are well off for bowling talent just now, but
also that they should have no small pull in being able to
change their teams, at the last moment, to suit the
wicket. Martin and Sharpe, chosen as dirty-weather
bowlers, are, however, lengths behind either Peel
or Attewell with the bat, and seeing that such bats
as W. G. Grace and Walter Read were always pretty
helpless on a heavy wicket, the Australians had a
fair show to snatch the “brilliant” muddy victory
they narrowly missed. The kindest—or, perhaps, the un-
kindest—thing to say of the Australians batting this trip
is that they make as many runs against the best howling
on bad wickets, as they do'on good ones. With conditions
favourable for run getting they have made very few
decent scores against the professional attack.
THE LONDON POSTMEN.
There is no class of men on which the business
public are more dependent than on the London
postmen. They are entrusted with communications
of the highest importance, which rarely, if ever,
they fail to deliver promptly and on time. These
men, as a class, are sober, industrious, hard-worked
servants. From early morning until late at night,
in all weathers, they continue to tramp over and
over the same route. They become a part and
parcel of the business man’s existence Thi s
constant walking and exposure in this changeable
climate often entails rheumatic difficulties, pains
and stiffness in the limbs ; yet there can be no
cessation from the daily routine of their lives.
Whether suffering or not, they are obliged to be
at their post. It is said that a great proportion
of the London postmen always keep that famous
remedy, St. Jacobs Oil, by them, applying it to
the muscles after a severe day’s work as a pre-
ventive. Others who have received sprains
have been promptly cured by the application of
this remedy, and they not only use it upon them-
selves and families, but recommend it to others.
Mrs. J. Brooker, 47 Princess-road, Kennington
Cross, London, S.E., the wife of a postman,
writes; —“I have suffered most agonising rheu-
matic pains through my shoulders and the back of
my neck for some months past, many times being
unable to obtain any sleep at night, which wholly
unfitted me for my household duties in the day-
time. My husband having heard his fellow-post-
men speak very highly of St. Jacobs Oil for
sprains and soreness in the limbs, as well as for
neuralgia and rheumatism, procured a bottle from
the company’s office, at 45 Farringdon-road, the
contents of which he applied to the afflicted parts,
and to our great suprise and joy the pain departed
almost at once, affording me the first good night’s
sleep I had been able to obtain for many a night. I
consider St. Jacobs Oil an invaluable preparation for
pain, and shall always keep a bottle of it on hand.’>
A. F. Cann, of 31 Swinton-street, Gray’s Inn.
road, London, W.C. writes -“One morning on
my round, a< postman, I sprained my ankle and
was scarcely able to walk, when I was recom*
mended to use St. Jacob’s Oil. I procured a
bottle, and before I had used one-half the con.
tents I was perfectly cured.” Mr. H. Newman,
45 Picton street, Camberwell, London, S.E., post-
man, says: “Have suffered from rheumatism in
the knees for a period of twelve months, during
which time I consulted several physicians and
tried many remedies, without receiving any bene-
fit. Being advised to use St. Jacobs Oil; I hav e
much pleasure in saying that it eased the pain
directly. I felt it act like an electric battery on
me. The contents of one bottle completely cured
me, and I can now walk as well as ever. I hava
no hesitation in recommending St. Jacobs oil to all
suffering from rheumatism as being a ‘ Conqueror
of Pain.’” While the postman’s “lot at best is
not a happy one,” he is undoubtedly saved much
pain and discomfort, which he would otherwise be
obhged to endure, were it not for the remedy in
question.— Manchester Athletic News.

The Lay of C. Divan.
I’m a bushman from the Bogan, whence I yester-
day came down
With a cheque to spend on liquor and the pleasures
of the town,
Yet I’m now without a “stiver,” a debauched and
broken man,
Which is owing to a fellow known to me as 0.
Divan.
After reaching Redfern Station I began to knock
around,
And I swallowed sev’ral boozes as a man of cash
is bound, ,
Then my ’baeca-pouch got emptied, and to fill it 1
was my plan,
And I stumbled at that moment up against “ Cigar
Divan.”
To the window I was tempted by a glimpse of
women fair,
Ev’ry known professional beauty being represented
there; *
But before the shop I entered I took care the sign
to scan
Where this name was painted up—oh, confound
that C. Divan !
In attendance at the counter was a nymph of
beauty rare,
Well-developed, painted, powdered, with a free
*and winning air,
Who said, “ Step into the parlour, oh ! you wicked,
naughty man !”
Weak, I followed her, expecting there to meet
with C. Divan.
Not a moment were we seated when she spoke to
me of fizz,
Then I found that, though unlicensed, yet she ran
a liquor biz. ;
And sh" drew the cork as deftly as the oldest
pub'dean,
While siie whispered That she loved me even more
than C. DiVah.
Nothing further I remember till I found myself
to-day.
Charged with ructions, at the Central, and I
heard the copper say—
“ Drunk, yer worship, quite incapable, uncon-
scious, an’l ran

\ great row is now going on concerning
the original authorship of certain opinions on
orange - cultivation, between William Olarson,
F L S., of Mildura, and David Crichton, of the
Victorian Department of Agriculture, in which a
charge and counter-charge of plagiarism have been
made. Reading the pamphlet published by the
former in self-justification, one is led to believe
that he has somewhat the best of the position;
though no one can say what may happen when the
Admirable Crichton’s thunder comes along.
“ Many innocent people, says the cable,
“ were killed during the revolutionary uprising in
the Argentine Republic.” Now that the fighting
is over in Buenos Ayres, this is the kind of talk
that may be heard when a bank-clerk meets a
friend : “ How did you get on in the Revolution .
“Pretty well. You see, I owed my tailor
dollars, and the villain threatened to complain to
my manager if I did not pay up. Well, I de-
nounced him as a partisan of the President, and
i the mob broke into his place and killed him, and,
i while they were pillaging, I burnt his books, so 1
am clear of that lot.” “ But, amtpo, it was too
bad to get the poor man killed for the sake of a
paltry debt. ” “ Pouf'. One must make something
i out of these revolutions. Also, I had a shot at old
i Garcia, the bootmaker, but, by bad luck, I missed
him.” “ You missed him !, Demomosl What a
| pity ! I owe him ten dollars myself.”
Ibsen and bis Critics.
Editor Bulletin.—Sir,—Will you permit me to
address a few words to Mr, Fred. J. Broomneld,
at whose disposal you recently placed two columns
of The Bulletin to allow him to air his views
upon “ Ibsen and his Critics ?” From the headline
of Mr. Broomfield’s letter, I had expected to meet
witli something controversial —something intel-
lectual -but, unfortunately, only found hterarv
vapourings. Mr. Broomfield’s insistence upon
“ voluntary union,” indicates plainly that the tie
whion he desires should subsist between the sexes
is that of free love. Fie ! Mr. Broomfield. Read
Artemus Ward, and profi by his experience of
the vagaries of those who belong to that cult. Ihe
ardour imported into Mr. Broomfield’s pleading
for voluntary union and the forcible vituperation
lavished upon a state of society with which he can
have no acquaintance point to one conclusion : Mr.
Broomfield must be a bachelor. Otherwise he
would not be so enamoured of the platform of un-
controlled relationship between the sexes. To
such a one promiscuity would doubtless be very
alluring. Fathers and brothers may have prosaic
objections to urge. Gan it be that Mr. Broomfield is
an enthusiast who rides hobbies to death, or who
accepts theories merely because they are the fig-
ments of the fallacy of some half-crazed visionary i
Or' is it that he is a recluse who from his retreat
derides at the products of worldly experience ?
Where he is most faulty is that he is not careful
about his definitions. A riotous state of mind,
induced by cloistered contemplation of the allure-
ments of free love, may account for his short-
comings in this respect. Will he explain, in ordi-
nary nineteenth-century prose, what he means by
“conventional marriage ?” Does he allude to the
formal ceremonial practised on the Continent,
where the parents are the arbiters of their chil-
dren’s fate? Or does he refer to the marriage-
customs ruling in Australia? If he intends to
deride the Continental marriage, I am with him.
But it seems more probable that he is tilting at
any form of contract between the sexes. No one
nowadays disputes that a woman ought to be at
liberty to marry the man of her choice, in order
that an “idealistically-perfect union” should
be celebrated. A man’s groom may, if the lady
be willing, ally himself to his master’s daughter.
Nothing unholy attaches to such a union, except
in the opinion of those who bend before the shrine
of Mrs. Grundy. But when choice, voluntary
choice, has been made, responsibilities ought not
to be burked. Where trouble would ensue, if Mr.
Broomfie d’s system were brought into force, wou d
be that any pretext would serve as an excuse for a
woman to leave her home and her children. It is
not an unusual thing for a woman to tire of the
company of her husoand because he lavishes too
much affection on her. One woman cannot be
happy unless she is the ruler, an ther unless she is
the subject. It is just the same with men, and it
is such aberrations in disposition which upset
social systems reared on the Broomfield type. All
this preaching about the degraded condition of
women is very amusing, for does not history
demonstrate that when women will, men become
puppets ? In the example I ha e given the
woman was not compelled to wed the groom
nor to beget children, yet if she imagined that
“ the identity of those feelings and passions ”
which, according to Mr. Broomfield, should con-
stitute the ideal marriage did not exist, she might,
upon the flimsiest excuse, leave her homfe. It is
no answer to say that the -husband-would be well
rid of bier. The point is, should she have this easy
means of escaping responsibilities which she volun-
tarily accepted? Mr. Broomfield has evidently
got this bee of free love in his bonnet. Let him
get a wife, learn to love her and teach her that she
is not a slave to passion nor an ornament, but a
true help-mate. When he has done this, let the wife
announce to him that, because he objects to (say)
her thoughtlessly plunging him into debt, there is
no mental affinity between them, and let her leave
him ! He may then realise the pan? o f separation,
and may recognise that theories afford but unsub-
stantial comfort to a household rent in twain by
some petty outburst of temper.—l am, &0.,

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 20,1890.
My Dear Moorabinda, —
N.S.W. Horticultural Society held one of its periodical
floral outbursts at Sydney Town Hall vestibule on 13th
inst., when Lady Carington, with H.E. and brother
Rupert, declared it formally open at 4.30, and wore a
heliotrope poplin skirt with moire ribbons of the same
shade, velvet bodice edged with gold galon, bonnet in
gold straw and purple velvet, and carried a very choice
posy, the gift of the society. Mrs. Burdekin was also
present during the afternoon, as were most local
lovers of garden-stuff, though the tendency of
flower-show crowds trends greatly and naturally
to the thick-soled boots and phllocomed hair of
the professional gardener, who lurks beside his pot
exhibit, throwing glances of deepest envy at his hated
rival, guardian of the adjacent abnormal bachelor’s-button
or hyper-developed Scotch thistle. The show was mainly
camellias (which, easily-soiled, stiff and scentless, are not
my favourite blossom) of no very special size, although
the colouring was very pure. The floral-baskets were
fetching, though I didn’t like the first prize so well as an
apparently unappreciated hamper of buttercups and fern,
which was most artistic. An exhibit where all the pots
were fixed up in white wadding suggested a visit to one’s
dressmaker—or the earache, but a grouping of jonquils
and daffodils on green plush was absolutely charming.
Apropos of the camellia-show, I stood at the beautiful
hyacinth exhibits near a sylph-like maiden who had a
she-friend with her. The friend inhaled the scent of
a lovely purple bloom and the sylph followed suit, and
then, straightening herself up, remarked -fervently
“Whenever 1 smell hyacinths or tuberoses I want to hug
somebody.” What a priceless pointer tor her best boy to
get hold of!
I am told that one reason for the success of “ Paul
Jones ” choristers under the baton of Alfred Plumpton is
that he marks on the music where they are to take
breath, and this prevents much choral gurgling and
choking, as in ordinary cases the singer with the short
breath grows apoplectic in her efforts to hang on as long
as the lady with the wind of a blacksmith’s bellows.
Which reminds me that the “leading lady” sometimes
buttons Plumpton’s spotless kids before he hies him to his
orchestral throne. But which “ leading lady ? ”
Some people don’t know everything. Madame Marian
Burton, who, in private life, is Mrs. Waterlow (pronounced
by the precisians “Waterloo”), was shedding the light
of her smile on a small tea-party recently, when
one of the guests turned to her and asked in an amiable
and chatty way “ If she had been to ‘ Paul Jones’?” At
this juncture somebody kindly led the gentleman outside
and explained the case for his benighted benefit.
After an unusual lull, the Servant Question again rears
its hydra-head in the city of “ Arbour and Horgan.” “A
domestic ” writes to a daily bewailing an absence of hot
water in her bath, or something of the kind, and wildly
advocating a servants’ union, and “ A Missus” acridly re-
taliates in the next issue, so war is again declared. Most
of the trouble seems to arise over the infrequency of
Bridget’s accorded opportunities for courting the pensive
policeman by gaslight in the back-lane. “Missus” com-
plains of Ellen’s habit of slipping out to “post a letter” on
alternate nights in the week—and when you reflect what
heavy work girls undertake in shops and factories, where
“ notice ” isn’t saucily given because of some trivial dis-
agreement, then it becomes clear that domestic service*
under the same conditions with regard to evening leisure*
would be, perhaps, a peaceful and beautiful thing.
In Adelaide (hey have struck a successful plan—adopted
in Sydney by a few people, but not to such an extent as in
the flat city—that of “day-servants,” who are hired (by the
mon th, of course) to come at 7 a.m. and depart either before
or after the last meal, thus having their coveted evenings
always to themselves. This plan is only feasible in one.
help menages, but as the majority of Australian homes
are run by a single exile, the South Australian inspiration
is a noble idea. There is a Sydney suburban household
where the girl comes at 7 a.m. and leaves at 7.30 p.m.
The mistress has tried this plan four years, and has
changed servants twice only in that time, while her maid
is as jolly as a sand-hoy, and the china wreckage insigni-
ficant. The plan is an admirable one under either of two
sets of conditions ; it is a good one if you happen to
know for certain that your servant lives with her own
people when she is not at your house. It is also a good
one if you have no conscience.
Among the drawbacks to day-service are the facilities it
hffers the help with wide ideas on the subject of meum
and tuum for making off with nocturnal swags of articles
not easily missed. Another is that if an unexpected «nest
drops in after the departure of your Abigail, you have to
answer the door yourself, and prepare and hand round the
“ cakes and But an extra shilling or two will pro-
long your help’s sojourn on the premises if you expect an
invasion or an “ at home ” —and even if it won’t,'it’s better
to make your own coffee once a month than go without a
servant half the year.
The vice-regal enclosure at Flemington during Cup
week won’t lack furbelows this time, since the ladies
Dorothea Louisa and Estella Mary Hope, sisters of
Governor Hopetoun. are coming out per Britannia to
quiz the “colonists.'’ It is quite time that the young
spinster aristocrat dumped her hair-trunk on our shores
and went on a squatter-chase, just to give local gilded
youth an even chance of aggrandisement with their more
sociallv-fortunate sisters, who have coronets and things
laid at their feet every time we shuttle Governors, while
their malt compeers ore left to the untitled and home-
grown blandishments of the indigenous syren. But the
worst of it is that even when the unmarried damsel of
high degree does venture across the ditch under vice-
regal chaperonage she generally regards local eligibility
with a lion-on-your-old-stone-gates sort of glare that nips
his young affections at the bud and pulls up his honour-
able intentions by the roots, so that the last state of that
man is worse than his first. Nevertheless, Melbourne
masherdom must be on the qui vive at the idea, and I
feel that I am only doing it a common kindness in
hinting that moire dress-coat revers are quite doosid
form “at home,” and also that the best models still part
their hair down the middle when they aren’t too bald to
comb up.
Signora Fabris—who lost a lot of money over the Royal
marionettes—is to give a benefit concert at an early date
next month. The leading artistes have offered their
services, the Mayor will provide room and lighting, and as
Lady Manning, Mrs. Burdekin, Madame Kellermann, and
other ladies are really interesting themselves in the matter,
a large audience should result.
The “ lady help” industry must be getting at a low ebb

Mrs. J. R. Ashton, wife of the President of the N.S.W.
Art Society, has some idea of arranging “social evenings’’
at the society’s rooms once a month, but no definite ar-
rangements have been arrived at so far.
The committee of the East Sydney Rowing Club deserve
congratulations of the deepest dye for the success they
made of their annual ball held at West’s, on 14th inst.
The rooms were decorated with oars tied with the
colours (blue and white) of the club, and the supper-table
was very specially decorated with flowers, fans, mirrors
and fairy-lamps. There were nearly 200 visitors present
who were carefully looked after by the übiquitous M.’sC.,
Messrs. Ackland and Gribben, and the dressing was
generally good. Mrs. Marshall wore flesh-pink silk and
green velvet with pink jetted lace; a white tulle gown

had panels of white brocade and was adorned with lilies
of the valley ; a fair girl in yellow tulle and silk was a
success, and a white cashmere and green velvet dress with
Medici collar edged with pearls, was a most fetching
costume. Among the guests was Sculler O’Connor—who
learnt all the dancing he knows in Australia, by his own
confession.
It is terrible to read that ** the newest Parisian dresses
are all copied from historical toilettes.” I sincerely hope
the fashion doesn’t strike Sydney. The mental picture o*
a-fifteen-stone matron who will get herself up to repre-
sent Cleopatra is enough to frighten a person interested
in contemporaneous clothing. And then the anxious
question arises, how far back will the fair seeker after
novelties go in search of a killing idea ? When the hot
summer comes, the airy attire of our alleged lady pro-
genitor would commend itself to the woman who has a fig-
tree in her back-yard, while the poetical, filmy draperies
of mythology offer a solution of the problem how to be
cool and stylish to the girl who borrows Paris fashions.
Miss Naylor, the popular Sydney accompanist, gives a
concert in the Centenary Hall, York-street, on 29th inst.,
when she will be assisted by Miss Colborne Baber (who
achieved a big success at Bathurst the other day in
“ Home, Sweet Home ”), Kowalski, Lemmone, and other
shining lights who have offered to adorn the attractive
bill on this occasion.
That gubernatorial attach*) has really succeeded in
effecting a big mortgage on the affections of Australia’s
richest heiress. ' The wedding-day will shortly be an-
nounced.
Lord and Lady Carington will visit Waggaon 3rd prox.,
returning to Sydney two days later. They are going
merely at the pressing invitation of the townspeople, and
neither will be asked to open anything—not even a cham-
pagne-bottle. As Wagga is the Claimant’s former home
and is much better known by name in England than Syd-
ney, Baron Carington would hardly dare return to “the old
grey house near the grave of John Hampton ” without
being able to say he had visited the City of Crows.
The Carington Centennial Hospital for Convalescents
at Camden will, on 20th inst., be opened by Lady Caring-
ton for the reception of patients. Lord Carington will be
there, and is to open the Masonic Convalescent Hospital
shortly afterwards.
The annual Masonic ball of the lodge Sydney Tarbolton
was held in the Town Hall Vestibule on 12th inst., when,
despite the sloshy streets and dismal drizzle without,
there was a very good attendance indeed. A cream silk
with tulle draperies and pearl tablier was pretty, and a
pale.pink cashmere over apple-green was fresh and well-
fitting. The excellent music was under the b&ton of
“Brother” De Groen, and the catering was good.
Thirteenth inst. in the Horgan city was decidedly the
dilettante day out, since a picture-show, a flower-show,
and an Orpheus concert all took place one on top of
another. The Anglo-Australian loan collection of
pictures at the York-street Rink—which was wonderfully
transformed for the occasion—was alleged to be opened
by Lord and Lady Carington at three p.m., but although
the vice-regal twain arrived as per advt., attended by
brother Rupert in all his glory, no bored vice-regal bark
wafted down the listening breeze, and it is Sappho’s
rooted conviction that the thing was set going by a yawn
on the one hand and a smile on the other. But that made
no difference, anyhow. Some of the works of art don’t
merit the catchy rapture people indulge in so fearlessly in
front of each frame, but on the whole the show soothes a
barbarian “kawliny” whose appreciation of art is only
one stage ahead of coloured almanacks. The light is
very good and groups of palms in pots, terra-cotta busts
plaques and tables set with bric-ii-brac give the gallery a
gay and festive appearance—the only discrepancy being
in the numbers of chairs provided, there being rather too
few for an art show where one generally feels like the
hypochondriac in the “ Pickpocket ” all the time. There
was a very fair attendance. Besides the Government
House gang there were Mrs. Burdekin, in shades of helio-
trope ; Mrs. J. R. Ashton, in Indian red cloth and black
velvet, with black felt feathered hat; Mrs. P. B. Lark, in
a very special Paris frock in ecru woollen striped with
white, relieved with brown velvet, nobby hat in ecru
ostrich-feather sand brown velvet; and a girl in Indian-
red cloth braided in black, black Medici collar and hat in
red, black-jet and black birds—took all one’s attention off
the walls. And Alfred Plumpton was there wearing a big
diamond ring and pin, and expressed his intention o
criticising the pictures another day ; and the Rev. Charles
Clark went about with his hands behind him d la school
child. A special feature of the gallery will be gratis after-
noon tea “on alternate afternoons.” The deep sagacity—
not to say craftiness—of this announcement has only to
be understood to be appreciated.
I wonder what base motive actuates a draper when he
fills his windows with spring fixings in the middle of
winter? To see a shopful of blooming flowers and gauzy
hats when you are conscious of a westerly-wind nose and
wet feet isn’t a pleasing sight, though the present floral
outburst on the part of the Sydney shops isn’t as aggra-
vating as it would be if flower hats hadn’t been sported
all the winter. I suppose the primary object is to make
thoughtless people believe that beautiful Spring 1 is here,
and rush and buy a hat constructed of two-and-a-halt
wires covered with gauze and held together by a tulle
butterfly and a bugle, only to see it go sailing over the
street on top of a howling blast “from the mountains”
accompanied with sleet, the first time they put it on. As
one swallow doesn’t make a toper, neither do a hundred
airy hats in a window herald the presence of the poetic
season. They only signify that the shopkeeper has a
heap of 11 old lots” to dispose of with the aid of inspired
labels, while the real “novelties ” and “ as worn now ” are
being kept dark on the weather bow.
At most “ hall” concerts held in Sydney, the Y.R. party
have a dreadful time of it. They are always placed in the
very first row, about a yard off the trouble, and no matter
if the bill includes cymbal and big-drum solos, there they
must sit in stolid martyrdom in the very heart of the row',
and in the very worst position for hearing possible ! I sup-
pose the reason is that it wouldn’t be “ de rigger” to have
people sitting ahead of the Governor on the same level,
and so “one has to suffah for one’s ordah, yerknow.”
A preliminary meeting in connection with the proposed
“ Home for Governesses” was held at Sydney Town Hall
on 15th inst., under the presidency of Mayoress Burdekin-
Nothing definite was arrived at except that such an estab-
lishment was needed, and as the principal movers in the
scheme leave town shortly for an indefinite period, the
“ home” will, lam afraid, long remain in the sky. Offers
of help and cash-insults will be received by Mrs. Burdekin
at the Town Hall.
Everybody should have worn a black gown at the
final-brethren-and-farewell Orpheus concert at Sydney
V.M.C.A. on 131 b inst., for I’m sure all felt like crape and
cashmere and weepers. The opening Rheinberger quartette
was a very special thing indeed. Rivers Allpress played
an "Andante'’ by Poussard, accompanied by the com-
poser, and both had “ to bow their acknowledgments,”
and Kowalski rioted through a Chopin item in a way tha
sent an electric thrill from the soles of your boots to your
chignon. A lady from Camden, in yellow and white silk,
adorned in a decorative way with yellow roses and autumn
* leaves, was unwise in attempting the “ Prayer ” from
Tannhauser, while remembrances of Saville’s soft top
notes were in the memory of most present—and this lady’s
habit of vocalising through her clenched teeth suggested
the idea that she felt sea-sick. Miss Hoffman, in cream
silk, sang weirdly in a duet with “ Daddy,” but as
C. Huenerbein had just trickled through his “Berceuse,”
most of the audience were too sleepy to resent anything
but an alarm-clock. There was a crowded, well-dressed
house led by Lord and Lady Carington, Miss Walenn, and
Captain Trench, the vice-regal gown being a train of crim-
son satin brocaded in grey-green design, over a front of
pale, grey-green satin, mantelette in red velvet and cloth
with ridged sleeves, diamond spray in the hair and mana-
gerial bouquet of snowdrops and camellias and ferns.
Miss Walenn wore black silk and net gown with crimson
plush mantelette. And Baron Carington wore his hair
parted down the centre and whiled away the time whis-
pering waggish comments to Lady C., which seemed to
amuse her greatly. Speaking of concerts, at a very high-
class warble held in Sydney recently, a breathless pause
fell “in front” when it was comprehended that the
narrow shoulder-strap of a lady vocalist was slowly slip-
ping from grace. It was an exciting time, but when the
strap got fairly on the down grade the lady grasped the
situation with her side eye and hitched it backed to duty.
Nevertheless the prospect before she did so made many a
blushing young man hide his face in his programme for
the rest of the evening.
Miss Achurch was “ at home” by invitation to a crowd
of people at her residence, “ Vittoria,” Woollahra, on 15th
inst. Among those present were Sir George and Lady
Innes, Judge and Mrs. Windeyer, the Misses Allen, Mrs.
Garran—seventy guests in all. Ibsenish conversation,
refreshments, and the wonderful baby were the com-
ponent parts of the spree, which was so successful that
Mrs. Charrington intends holding another and a larger
one shortly, when a “ novelty” is promised, at the name
of which I am not permitted to hint.
Yours affectionately,

unique. The floor, supper and music were all that, could
be desired, the latter being supplied by Miss Hardy.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Well-kuo \Vn in Brisbane was that patriotic
old “ Hielantnan,” “Frazer the Piper,” whose
proud Celtic ancestors pulled round the ark in a
boat of their own,” and danced to the tune of
“ Ghillie Galium " on the first patch of dry land
that left room enough for a Hielanman s foot.
Frazer was once returning from a Warwick show,
and he broke the monotony of the rail way-journey
to Toowoomba by playing a series of warlike airs
on the “ baagpeeps.” On arrival at Toowoomba he
stepped out on the platform and struck-up Hie
March of the Cameron Men.” An intelligent
bobby, suffering from superfluous intellect, strode
indignantly up to the old Highlander and told
him to “Shtop that damm row there!” Old
Frazer simply glared at him, in speechless,
measureless contempt. The “ trap ” said ‘ I com-
mand yez to hould yer whistle, in the name of the
people av Toowoomba !” Then the aged musician
mournfully folded up his instrumental orchestra,
and turning to a brither Scot, instructed him as
follows ;—“ Here, Tonal, ye’ll tak the pipes an’
lock her by! She’ll ga doon ta Brisbane in ta
mornin’ an’ she’ll buy Toowoomba, an’ she’ll pay
for her, an’ surely ta God she’ll get leave ta play
ta pipes in her ain toon !” All of which is Gospel
truth.

The day after Morehead retired from office
he again brandished the “ free and flashing sword ”
with 0 which he slays his opponents. _ Referring
Sarcastically to Griffith’s prospective Ministers, rfe
said; “I would advise Sam to make— trea-
surer There is nothing in the Treasury for him
to steal and he might be tempted to appropriate
the deficit!” He referred to a politician who m
past years had a bare-handed contest with the
laws and was knocked out twice in the first
round.

How many people know that Bathurst
burr was introduced to Australia by two brothers
named Abercrombie, who brought over wild Pam-
pas horses from .Valparaiso in 1862 ?
* * *
Rolf Bold re wood has compiled an incompre-
hensible but most readable hash out of that story
of the Bowen Downs cattle, in his “ Robbery
Under Arras.” It reminds me of the small boy’s
essay oh Chaos, “a great big heap of nothing,
and nowhere to put it.” I. will now give you the
first-published account of that remarkable trans-
action, obtained from authorities who cannot be
questioned,
* * *
Redmond and his friends took up some country
fo side Bowen Downs. The stolen mob of Bowen
Downs cattle had been driven on to the edge of
the run by some Bowen Downs acc mplice, and
some 1200 head were taken clean away by Red-
mond to South Australia. Among the lot was a
slab-sided white bull, covered with brands, pur-
chased from Archer, of Graeemere station, near
Rockhampton. The manager of Bowen Downs
at that time was Mr. Ranken, brother-in-law
of B. D. Morehead. So cunningly were the
cattle removed that some time elapsed before
Ranken became conscious of anything wrong.
The white bull from Graeemere was the only
animal the sale of which could be traced to
anybody, and it was apparently traced to
Redmond, who was arrested and locked-up at
Blackall, and remanded twenty-eight times, these
remands extending over a period of six months,
merely on the word of a policeman who believed
Redmond was guilty. At the end of the six
months he was discharged, and re-arrested at
Warialda a few weeks afterwards, brought before
the P.M. there three times, and on each occasion
admitted to bail, himself in £4OO and two sureties
of £2OO each. Bail was always obtained. From
Warialda he was remanded, on warrant, to Roma,
where he was released on bail to appear at Roma
in six weeks. Bail was granted by George Lukin,
P.M., now Police Magistrate at Maryborough.
In the meantime the white bull was brought
round by sea from Adelaide and placed in a pad-
dock at Mount Abundance Station, five miles from
Roma. At the end of the six weeks Redmond
appeared in answer to bail, and Police-Inspector
Nutting applied for a remand for eight days. Red-
mond asked for bail, which was granted by Lukinin
opposition to the police, who were unable to give
any reason why it should be refused. At the end
of eight days a packed bench refused bail to Red-
mond, who thereupon applied to the Supreme
Court, and a mandamus was issued by Judge
Lutwyche compelling the Roma Bench to grant
the bail. At the final trial in Roma, at the Dis-
trict Court, the chief witness against Redmond
was the Adelaide man to whom he was alleged
to have sold the white bull. The trial was
before Judge Blakeney, with Pring as Crown
Prosecutor—he had been sent up for that
purpose tor'replace Healy, as more likely, to
■#cure a conviction. One of the witnesses was a
mJn brought out of aN.S.W. lunatic asylum, sup-
posed to be one of Redmond’s party. He broke
down under cross-examination, after swearing the
bull was one of a mob taken by Redmond from
Bowen Downs. The evidence showed that if the
South Australian witness had received £2OO he
would have cleared out before the trial, and gone
home again. Redmond was ably defended by
barrister Paul, now the genial Judge Paul of the
Queensland District Court. The jury returned a
verdict of “ Not Guilty !” So that 1200 head of
cattle were taken away and sold, four men tried
for the offence—and nobody convicted !
• * #
One result of this trial Was that the
Government abolished the criminal jurisdiction of
the District Court at Roma, for Judge Blakeney
averred that no jury there would convict horse or
cattle-stealers. In order to save the civil sittings
of the Court, the lawyers arranged a dummy case,
which was withdrawn when the Court opened.
When Judge Blakeney was leaving, the whole
adult male population of Roma turned out in black
clothes with white handkerchiefs, surrounded the
Judge’s coach, and pretended to weep bitterly. On
that very day the criminal jurisdiction of the
Court had been restored by wire, but was with-
drawn again when the “weeping episode” was
reported to the Government, One of the funniest
facts in this interesting drama was the trial of
one of the four accused, three years afterwards,
for horse-stealing, before his former counsel, who,
in his judicial capacity, gave his old client 18
months’ hard labour ! This was the unkindest
cut of all !
# # *
One who was present at the trial tells me
that “ Redmond was one of the best bnshmen in
Australia. He looked like a prosperous Methodist
parson, and came into court with a long black
frock-coat and a cotton umbrella, clean-shaved,
except a little side-whisker, with a very demure
and sanctified expression. He looked about 40
years of age, atid sft. Gin. in height, and weighed
about 13 stone. ” These are solid facts, somewhat
different to the picturesque narrative in “ Robbery
Under Arms !” However, fiction has a big
license.

The present Chief Justice of Queensland
married into a family named Jeays, One daw a
Hibernian agriculturist came in town to see Mr.
Jeays, and, while looking for that gentleman, met
the Rev. B. G. Wilson, the Baptist clergyman.
“ Can yer rivirince show me the way to Jeayses ?"
enquired the artless child bf Erin. The old
clergyman solemnly pointed his hapd to the
Zenith, reverently raised his eyes in the same
direction, and replied : “Yes, my friend, there is
the place where He lives !” “Och, shure, that’s
not the wan Oim lukkin for —Oi want Misther
Lilley’s father-in-law !”
# * *
The Australian trade in kanakas is now
near its termination. The first South Sea Islanders
were brought to New South Wales by the V elo-
city, in 1847, for Mr. Ben. Boyd. There were 66
men and 4 women. The year 1890 is the period
beyond which no 1 about vessel Shall bring any
mote kanakas to Queensland, and there is not
much prospect of that privilege being extended.
Three years more will terminate the engagements
of the last “boys” imported, and then .must the
sugar-planters face the problem of “white labour
or collapse ” !

I was present Recently at a luncheon given
in Brisbane to J. L. Toole. His powers of con-
versation and oratory would not have made his
name known to the people in the next yard. He
only told one anecdote, and that was common
property among the apprentices at the forge of
Tubal Ca n. He reminded me of Alexander in
the studio of Apelles.
MAROOGALINE.
Two gentlemen in V ictoria ate arguing a
question about some sheep, and are acquiring ruin
and information simultaneously. One of them, it
is stated, trespassed with the sheep on the other s
land, and the other came out and chased them olf.
He is said to have put a good deal of unnecessary
force of expression into his conduct: anyhow, the
man with the sheep sued him for damage, and
needless velocity, and wear and tear, and so on.
He recovered one shilling, Olid the judge ordered
him to pay all costs, amounting to nearly £1000,
so that his victory promised to leave him £009 to
the bad, and then he spent about £500 more on an
appeal to the Full Court. The Full Court re-
versed the order as to costs, on the_ ground
that the judge was short of jurisdiction, and
decided that the plaintiff should pay his own costs,
some £600—and that the defendant should settle
the rest of the invoice. Next the defendant
made an expensive application to Judge in
Chambers demanding permission to appeal to the
Privy Council, and spent a good deal of money in
finding-out that the Judge in Chambers didn t
know whether he could appeal in such a case or
not. Finally he was directed to waste anothei
large sum in asking the Full Court whether it was
competent to carry the case to England or not, and
a listening world still awaits the result, ihe bill
is getting well on towards £3000 by this time, and
both parties begin to feel that at would have been
cheaper to settle the matter pugilistically, and
then make a common assault-case out of it.
Twenty years after the -Battle of Worth?
says the German Emperor, the last missing frag-
ment of German soil lias been peacefully added to
German territory. Thus wrote the German poet,
Carl Tanner, in 1807 :
The Lost Child.
On the main, on the glorious German main,
The wind and the wave both loud complain,
And ev’rv wave it carries along
Of our long-lost child the plaintive song,
Red is the strand,
White is the sand,
Such is our German Helgoland.
O Germany i ot mothers best,
Thou gather’st thy children to thy breopt,
O ne’er forget thy smallest child,
Exposed to the wave and tempest wild.
Red is the strand, &c., &c.
As swells the sea to mountains high,
And fills each stream beneath the sky,
So swell those words and fill my heart
With longings wild and bitter smart.
Red is the strand, &0., &o.
And art thou poor, and art thou small,
Thy mother’s thoughts are still with thee all
Till the happy day (and ’twill surely come)
When the lost child smiles in its father s home.
Red is the Strahd, &c., &c.
The House of Lords was struck by light
ning recently, but it is painful to reflect that
nobody was in it at the time, so that the effort
was in a great measure thrown away. It-the
Upper Chamber could be knocked into chaos
it would be the beginning of a new and
brighter era for the Weary l/mpire; but, uu-
happily, there are seldom more than seven peers
in it at one time, and even though the whole seven
could be burst and crumpled up by some devour-
ing element, so that nothing would remain except
a pint of hair upon the floor, what are they among
so many? The House of Lords doesn’t need
more than half-a-dozen or so to form a quorum,
and when these sifc exhausted snags aie
gathered together they can block the pro-
cess of the nation all by themselves and
theft get away befote the lightning can hit
them, and the lightning is a bad shot anyhow, and
generally strikes some hard-working person with
a large family. The fact that not a single British
monarch was ever thunderblasted on the head,
and that the one solitary king m all the British
Isles who died of leprosy was pretty nearly the
only individual of his class who was worth preserv-
ing, has done more to undermine our religious
convictions than anything else. And just because
a peer is a mere imbecile obstruction and never
se; ved any useful purpose, it follows that a peei
could be dropped over a precipice 850 ft. deep, and
hit on the head with a shot-tower afterwards,
without suffering any injury; while a patriot
and a philosopher would break Ins neck
if he rolled-off a verandah 2ft. tun. high-
And if the peer in question was on hw
way to vote that the royal salary should be
raised and that the Coercion Act should be ex-
tended all over the empire, lie would arrive at the
House before the division-bell rang, even though
eleven tbavs loaded with railway iron went over
him on the road ; whereas, if he wanted to intro-
duce a measure for the nationalisation of -and, he
would accidentally sit down on a tack, and moiti-
fleation would set in next day. Ihe moral ot this
is that lightning doesn’t strike the House ot Lords
often enough to do any good, and if the nation
relies oh that Uncertain element, instead of em-
ploying some weapon that isn’t quite soAflow m
the operation, it will certainly get left.

At the Sign of the Shorn Sheep.
(FOR T HE BULLETIN.)
Before railwn had brought new-chum
labour to the door of the pastoral lessees, before
the iron-horse bad given M‘Muck and Co. power
to pen up a mob of “ scabs ’’and transport them to
the fair skin of Riverina, before the great Uir
known Reserve was thrown open to selection, in
fact, before it was generally known that a legiti"
mate prey was easily caught at “ the shearing ”
before all this, sharpers were few and far between*
and few spielers “ travelled on the game ” among
the squattages. But when digger “Hats” ran
short, when new-ehums (with coin) were superin-
tended by the police, military and club gentlemen
of Melbourne and Sydney, then the “fly” man
bethought him that there must be money, loot*
hoot, greed, stuff, sugar, dibs, possibles, and even
spondulicks where the busbies’ cheques came from.
Some accordingly learned to shear, some to roll
wool, and many to pretend to do the same. And
year by year the huts at shearing*time became less
safe to keep a pound in, though clothes, watches,
guns, and saddles were still seen lying about.
Then these excrescences returned to the slums of
Colling wood, Carlton, Woolloomooloo, and Light-
square and indiscreetly told their quondam mates
of their success. The railway and tree-passes did
the rest; the flood of employed unemployed set in,
and it became unsafe to own a silk handkerchief,
a meerschaum pipe, or a spare suit of clothes in
the general sleeping huts. At some stations
(always large ones) the mob of “lads,” sometimes
called “ talent,” were far and away the majority,
at others the older bushmen held the sway, and on
small stations the town sneak had to keep up a
fair disguise.
* # *
I am about to describe to you two men of
a class that is hybrid between the bushman who
never sees town and the professional “ gun.’ You
must learn the slang, where I do not explain it,
by reference to someone who has “ been there,” or
by taking a trip to the Riverina. There are many
men from Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide who
do a fair amount of work in the off-season in town,
and who would not miss the shearing and harvest
on any account. Some of these men are a cut
above ordinary “wiring,” but will cheat at cards,
and ring in a “nob” or “grey” at the heading-
school. The “ talent ” say they are afraid to prig,
but in the end I think the half-and-halfs, who
keep pretty well within the law, have the best of
it. They are not so often lime-burners (synonym
for “stone-brokers”), for signification whereof
ride slang-dictionary. Or, if you haven’t a slang-
dictionary, ask Parkes. He has been there.
# * *
Two-more dissimilar mates than Tommy
the Ringer and Tyke could not be found. The
ringer at a shed is the man who tops the list of
fast shearers. Tommy never shore a sheep in his
life. But once he had his name down for a pen,
and got a pair of shears, a stone, and a bottle of
oil. When the bell sounded he caught a sheep
and—let it go. The manager was near and knew
at once that (as a shearer) Tommy was a fraud.
He was quickly put on the rouseabout staff and
supplied with a broom. If he had been an ordi-
nary sweeper he’d have been dubbed “broomy n
or “sweeny,” but the unshorn sheep got him a
higher title, ironically “The Ringer.”
* * *
Who does not know Tommy the Ringer ?
1 mean that anyone who comes out of
Melbourne to Igok for a shed, can tell you
ail about Tommy and Tyke and their sayings
and.doings. Tommy was, and is, one of the best-
looking men in Melbourne. Even when “ Mops-
and-brooms ’ he was always clean and well-dressed.
Where he got his education and address I do not
know ; some say at the University, others at the
harm, wherever that may be. Certain it is that
he can translate Virgil and solve a quadratic, and
he reads politics instead of bogus championships.
A very different mart is Tyke. He first met
Tommy at one of Big Clarke’s stations, which they
sundowned after carrying the swag out of Mel-
bourne. Tommy was green, so was Tyke ; but
the latter had cheek, and faced every available
chance of cadging provender, and he shared it
with Tommy. Tyke knew what he was doing.
He thought that a well-dressed mate would do to
work the houses, kitchens', and the upper-ten when
fairly on tramp. Tyke was terribly dirty. I
don’t think the dirt was so real as apparent. He
never bought clothes. His town-suit was always
pawned or stowed away, and disinterred on liis
return. He was the prince of cadgers. His
coats were always too large, and were ragged at
the sleeves. He had no hats. You could not
honestly call his “cady” anything but a “cady ”
or “canbeen.” His trousers were picked up in
shearers’ huts, and his boots outside the same.
As for his shirt, not shirt, a footballer’s guernsey
which he begged off some triumphant player, that
was his nether garment; blue and white in the
beginning of shearing, brown and black later on >
until he was worried to wash it. A dip in the
wool-scour brought it back to its pristine colours.
* # #
These two independent variables became
mates, as I have said, and got into the same shed.
I have ttold you of Tommy’s entrance. Tyke
became “slushy,” or “cook’s mate.” They did
not spend much money. Tommy won a pound or
two at cards, and was accused of cheating. Tyke
won a few shillings and was growled at for “sock-
ing the stuff.” Then they repaired to the neigh-
bouring township. There the respectable-looking
Tom got drunk and lost all his money ; Tyke said
he had done the same. Then they got a second
shed and the same thing happened. Then they
went harvesting in Victoria and drank most of,
their money. Bendigo was what Tyke was pleased
to call his home; they stayed there a day and a
night, but Tyke refused to leave until about 12,
noon, next day. Tommy wanted to prospect for
more work, and went to look up the farmers at
some hotels. Soon he saw Tyke coming out of the
Post-office and went to ask him what Ire had seen
there. The answer was vague, but Tyke was now
ready to start, and they travelled on harvesting
and doing odd jobs until they reached Melbourne.
Here Tyke toolc to fish-hawking, and Ids mate got
a job as clerk in a grocery. That is all I have to
tell you about their first year. Their second was
like it, and they appeared to be still vast fr ends.
When Tommy was “broke,” the Tyke would always
lend hiin threepence or sixpence to get a pint, but
would invariably seek and obtain payment of the
same. Tyke would always drink if the drink was
free, but never paid or shouted for liquor. It was
during this year that the name was given him.
The Scotch overseer of a station said, “ Here’s this
tousy lookin’ Tyke again. We’ll gie him his auld
job,”
* « *
Strange to say, the Ringer’s money went
as before, and hi i chum declared that he also had
been bitten. Aid again they passed through
Bendigo; but Imre the better-looking and really
sharper of the pair made two discoveries. The
first wa,s that his mate was banking money in the
P.O. Savings Bank, and the second was that Tyke
could get drunk and still appear to be sober, and
even forget what he had done when drunk. Then
they went their ways again as before, and we see
them at the third exodus. Tommy was parti-
cularly civil to Tyke this year. He trusted him
with all his money, got it back from him when in
a township, and had it stolen as usual by Tyke,
who “socked it.” But Tommy had been studying
in the Public Library during his stay in the big
smoke, and had learnt a thing or two. On visiting
Bendigo ho refused to leave on the morning after
their entry. He carefully shephered Tyke until
ho saw him bank his money, and then he proposed
to have dinner at a public-house, and he (Tommy)
would pay. He also shouted a bottle of beer, and
then told Tyke that he knew he had a pound or
two in the bank, and could show him how to make
an honest livelihood by hawking, in which the
profits were more than cent, percent. Taking him
to the various merchants, and explaining to them
what he wanted, the Tyke entered into the scheme
and agreed to draw thirty pounds for a start.
i Tyke slept the sleep of the biter-bit,
and Tommy had a good look at his bank-book.
Only fancy, the miserable little wretch had
more than three hundred pounds in the
savings-bank! _ But it is necessary to give
a day’s warning before money can be drawn
at the P. 0., so the question was how to get Tyke
to give the warning and draw the money, for Tom
meant him to draw the lot. At last the latter hit
on a plan. He allowed his victim to sober up and
explained to him that it was silly to leave the
money there where he could not easily get it. He
did not know how much Tyke had, but if he put
it m an ordinary bank he would get a much higher
interest on his average monthly balance and could
make a better appearance with wholesale mer-
chants by giving cheques. Why not withdraw his
com, put it in a good bank, and do a week or two’s
work about the district so as to learn the best
markets? This was done and still the Tyke
thought that Tommy had no notion of the amount
he had in the bank.
* * *
On the evening of their return to Bendigo,
Tyke got Tommy to draw out a cheque, having
obtained a blank at the bank. But Tommy had
also found one in the office of the Shamrock, and
it was this latter that he filled up for £25. He
then filled up the one he had got at the bank for
£3OO and put it in a book on the table. After
Tyke had signed the smaller cheque Tommy asked
him to state definitely how they were to get on
together—were they to be mates, or was Tommy
to be only a servant ? Tyke said he’d give £1 a
week for a month and see how they got on. On
this Tom shouted bottled beer and went to fetch it.
About an hour afterwards he asked why Tyke had
not signed the cheque. Tyke said he had ;
Tom said he had only tried his pen on a
BCr ?’;P ~°f note-paper, and showed him some
scnbblmgs and produced the unsigned cheque.
Tyke the beer had got in his
head, and he signed the other one. Next dav
Tom asked if be remembered signing* the cheque.
Of course he did ; so they had two bottles of beer
at Tom’s expense, and about one o’clock went to
the bank. Then the moneyed man confessed he
was “ screwed,” and when Tommy presented the
cheque he leaned his head on the counter. The
cheque was passed and cashed, and Tom gave
Tyke £25 outside the bank-door, and repaired to
a hotel. From this time until a week or so after-
wards we have no accurate record of the doings of
this pair. In fact, I have only guessed at the
above facts. I can swear to the delivery of a
blank cheque to the Ringer; also to his having
gone with his mate and received three hundred
pounds in gold. It is also known that for a week
the two spent money in various places, and, arriv-
ing in Melbourne afterwards, they quarrelled
because the Ringer said that Tyke had lost and
squandered a fortune in a week and must have
planted a couple of hundred or so. “ Two.hun-
dred devils!" said Tyke “how much did 1 draw ?”
“Three solid centuries,” and refused to lend
me a tenner.” Tins sobered up the Tyke
in Earnest, for he had only four pounds in
his pocket. A telegram to Bendigo soon
proved that the Ringer spoke (apparently)
the truth, and from that day the Tyke has been"a
helpless, harmless, drivelling, idiotic sneak. JR,
spends his time in poking about the backyard of
the “ Shorn Sheep,” of which hostelry a word. It
was once the “Spotted Hog,” and the landlady
was a very nice, lady-like, little widow. She fell
desperately in love with one Thomas Tonsor, a
bushman who patronised the bar. The latter
proposed and soon became landlord. A few dabs
of white paint made the maculate poodle into
what is supposed to be a Shorn Sheep : hence the
sign. _ Just before marriage Tonsor said he won
£250 in a sweep. At least he produced that sum
in gold. Out of compassion for a poor old chum
who had gone balmy , he gave shelter and broken
victuals to a curious-looking animal in the back-
yard—a biped who is boots, messenger, wood-
chopper and watch-dog in one ; in fact, a faithful
hound. He answers to the name of Tyke. I can
recommend bushmen to the “Shorn Sheep Hotel.”

The London Institute of Actuaries pro-

men in examining for insurance in cases where
the applicant prefers to make a statement before a
responsible officer. This break away from the old
rule is based upon the idea that thousands of
persons who, though nervous, are in good health,
will not insure because they have to “pass the

Lost Soul.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
As the observation that Destiny is affected
by remote trifles is true of every rank and grade of
Society unconvicted or otherwise, it was not
to be expected that the felonry of Norfolk Island
in 184 - should be exempt from obedience to this
particular decree of nature. Convictdom enjoyed
many privileges; it had not, for instance, to
trouble its cropped head as to the means of sustain-
ing life; there was no occasion for it to bother
itself as to what it should eat or drink or put on,
or where it should sleep. A loving and beneficent
(Government relieved Convictdom of responsibility
in all these matters, and thus saved Convictdom
from much mental wear anti tear But even the
potent Government could not prevent the destiny
of the individual and collective felon being in-
fluenced by trifles. It could confer immunity
upon its erring children from most of the worries
of existence, but here it was powerless.
Consequently, the fact that it was the merest
trifle which for ever on this earth looked the door
of possib e reform on Convict Walter Edward
Tappin, No. 18,9(i!) per Governor Ready, was not
at all a singular one.
* » *
Tappin was the ex-Mayor of an English
city, of whom Bulletin readers have already
caught a glimpse on two occasions. Originally
transported for 21 years for forgery, to V.D.L.,
he had been forwarded on to Norfolk Island as a
“ colonially-convicted man with a concurrent sen-
tence ’ for a second offence committed at Hobart
Town. The first few months at the Settlement
had been spent by him in sullen resignation to his
fate, and his conduct had earned for him the
highly-esteemed post of a prison-writership. His
duties therein had brought him into contact with
the arch-fiend and arch-traitor is. natch bull, and
the evil genius of that aristocratic scoundrel had
oast its wonted spell over the ex-Mayor. ivnatch-
bull urged him to join in one of the many
conspiracies which he initiated only to betray, and
Tappin consented. Of course, he was “split
upon.” He was removed from his post (to which
Knatchbull was appointed as a reward for his
treachery) and, at the next sessions of the Special
Commission, received a third sentence--that of
“life.” This meant servitude in Longridge
(Quarry-gang. There a slight breach of the gang-
regulations had obtained for him the punishment
of three days’ “cells.” He had been returned to
the gang a couple of days when Destiny did him
another bad turn. It caused Air. Darrell, superin-
tendent at Longridge, to be vexed with a trifle
with which he. Convict Tappin, had as much to do
as the proverbial “unborn child” of convict
phraseology. We may remark, in this place,
that Super. Darrell occupies a niche in the proud
temple of British history as “ an able and conscien-
tious official!” '
# % *
On the evening on which Super. Darrell
locked the door on Convict Tappin’s chanc- s of
reform, he sat in his “ den ” at the Ridge Barracks
receiving the daily reports from his subordinates.
The prisoners had been just locked-up, and the
night-guards set. The day-duty men -warders,
overseers, and sub-overseers —however, were not
yet freed for their rest and recreation. They had
to report the proceedings of the previous- twelve
hours, and be themselves reported on. There was
this great merit in the system : if it encouraged
its humbler instruments to crush every spark of
manliness and virtue out Of the convict nature by
deceit and persecution, it subjected the instru-
ments themselves to like degradation. A con-
stable or overseer might gain promotion and
increase of pay by successfully concocting a charge
against one prisoner, or by laying a trap for another,
but at any moment he might tumble into a pit-
fall prepared for himself by a brother-officer who
wanted his billet. The penal establishment of
Van Diemen’s Land (Norfolk Island at this time
was controlled by the V.D.L. Government) had
reduced spying to a science. The name of spy is
abhorrent to British ears. Nevertheless, a Secre-
tary of State for the Colonies framed with his own
hand a recommendation that the System should
he “ administered by secret espionage.” A sugges-
tion from a Noble and Right Honourable authority
was, of course, an instruction. Would you learn
the signature attached to that infamous recom-
mendation? Here it is : Stanley [you may better
recognise the Noble and Right Honourable au-
thority under the title of the Earl of Derby.]
# # *
As became an able and conscientious official,
Super. Darrell made the Secretary of State’s re-
commendation the basis of his administration.
John Price had not yet arrived on the island, and
the head Longridge official was virtually indepen-
dent of the Civil Commandant; there was no one
to interfere with him. He exercised a summary
jurisdiction over officers and prisoners; and thirty
or forty times during each week inflicted punish-
ment without even formal reference to head-
quarters. Of course, this procedure was illegal,
for he was not a magistrate. Legality was, how-
ever, the last thing thought of by the rulers of
Norfolk Island at this period. During a term of five
years, every summary sentence pronounced by the
/stand authorities—ayyreyatiny one hundred and
twenty thousand (ashes and countless days’ “cells,”
and includin'! hundreds of special punishments,
such as the “ sprcad-raytc,” the “ tuhe-yay” and
double irons—was illcyal.
On this particular night, the first two overseers
reporting to the Superintendent had come in for
“a wigging.”
“Don’t tell me,'' said the Super, to Farm-
overseer Rootem, “Don't tell me that twenty pri-
soners have gone the whole day without commit-
ting a breach of the Regulations. I know better,
sir—the thing’s absolutely impossible. You’d
better look out, Rootem. If you’re not more
vigilant, 111 have to change you to a gang where
there are no quarters.” It is scarcely necessary
to say that Overseer Rootem acted upon the hint
thus given, and for two months subsequently did
not fail to report daily at least one instance of
misconduct on the part of a prisoner or prisoners.
It didn’t give him much trouble to invent a charge.
That Outer Farm was too comfortable a residence
to abandon for a mere whim of conscience.
To \\ orks Overseer Greenwood the Super, was
still franker. '1 in not satisfied, Greenwood, by
a long way, with the work you’re getting out of
that gang. I'm not going to allow any snuffling
sympathy with doubly-convicted felons to stop,
the progress of Her Majesty’s buildings. That
brickwork ought to have been done a week ago.
Report the fellows if they won’t work.”
“The work would have been done, sir; but yon
took two of my best hands to build tliat chimney
at the old barracks. The hands I have can't lay a
course a day bet ween ’em,” replied Greenwood.
“ They’re too old and weak, sir.”
“ I warn you not to make insolent observations,”
sharply exclaimed Darrell.
“ I beg’ your pardon, sir,” said Greenwood, sub-
missively, “ I ”
“Don’t interrupt, sir. lam the judge of what
quantity or quality of labour you require to get
through the work, and if you can’t get the proper
return from what I choose to allow you, I shall
put you down as either incapable or insubordinate.
Sign the duty-book, and go, sir, and remember
what I say.”
Greenwood went out from the Super.’s presence
with these words lingering in his oars. As he
walked to his pretty little cottage on the Cascades
road ho made up his mind that next day poor,
broken-backed “ Lifer ” Kelly would have to carry
another score oi hods full of bricks and mortar.
Also, that the bricklayers (several of whom had
been laying bricks for “ Government *’ for thirty
years or so, having been engaged on Governor
Macquarie's early Sydney monstrosities) would
have to work more actively. He knew every man
in the. gang was physically incapable of doing
more than he was already doing—he had already
driven them to the extreme of effort —but then
the Super, said that the seventy-years-old wretches
-—the “ invalids ” of the Island — must turn out
more work, and the Super, had to be obeyed, or
else (that was not to be thought of) he, the Over-
seer, would suffer. If the extra task-work so
operated on Kelly’s weakened frame that he fell
from the scaffolding ladder and broke his leg, or
if decrepit “ Ned the Bricky,” goaded to un-
reasoning madness by the new demand upon his
energies—save the mark ! —turned upon the pri-
soner next to h rn and drove his trowel into the
man’s back between the shoulder-blades ; if these
things did happen (as a matter o fact they re-
spectively did, one and three days later) —well,
the System, that beautiful and logical System,
would be to blame, and not he, w ho was but one of
its humblest instruments.
*# . #
The Super, had been put into a good
humour by the necessity ior reprimanding his two
subordinates. To prove the strict impartiality of
the man We have only to remark that he derived
as much pleasure from brow-beating an officer as
from torturing a prisoner.
Tiie next officer to follow Greenwood with his
report was Overseer Mitchell, of the tramway
team. He laid complaints against convicts Gooch
and Johnson, of his gang. The former had re-
fused to haul on the truck-rope at the same instant
as the others, while the latter had just qualified
himself by an obscene expression for the only
punishment, short of hanging, known to the
administrators of the System, which had not yet
been inflicted upon him. He had passed through
all but two of the gradations of penalty ; there
was scarcely a note in the whole gamut of physical
suffering to which his nature had nob thrilled ; of
all the reformatory machinery patronised by the
System he had but to make, in his own person,
the acquaintance of the tube-gag and the gallow s.
Super. Darrell, having heard Mitchell's allegation,
orctered Johnson “10 hours’ of the tube-gag ” on
the morrow, and Gooch to receive a “ dozen ”
lashes before he next went out to work with the
team. By a “ dozen ” was, of course, meant tin;
“Botany Bay dozen.” which was neither the
arithmetical dozen nor the baker’s dozen, but a
simple “ twenty-five. ” On the following morning,
accordingly, Convicts Gooch and J hnson, as
they filed through the door of D dormitory, would
be told to “ fall out for punishment.” This would
be their first intimation, perhaps, that they had
offended ; certainly the first that they had been
newly-sentenced. You see, to compel for enquiry
the attendance of prisoners accused of breaches of
the Regulations would have wasted a lot of Her
Majesty’s time, and the formality of the presence
of the accused was therefore generally dispensed
with.
Overseer Mitchell plumed himself on his report
putting him up a peg in the Super’s estimation.
Saluting and wishing his chief a flunkeyish
“Good-night,” he retired.
He had stepped twenty paces down the gravelled
path when he was called back to the Super.’s
office. The evening dusk had fallen, but there
was still light sufficient for the men waiting their
turn to perceive, as he passed through their ranks,
that Mitchell’s face was paler than when he came
• out.
“ Hello,” loudly whispered a constable, “who’s
been putting you away, Mitchell ?”
Everyuody knew what was the significance of
that recall after “report.” It conveyed the in-
teresting intelligence that the officer sent for had
been informed against by a fellow-official—most
likely by an immediate subordinate who wanted
his billet.
This was the case with Mitchell. His sub-
overseer and Armed-Guard, Crunch, had accused
him of speaking disrespectfully of the Superin-
tendent. Mr. Crunch’s motive may have been as
he asserted, a profound regard for the Superin-
tendent’s fame. It is possible, however, that the
circumstances that he had just been granted per-
mission to marry, and that the increment of
£2 6s. Bd. to his salary, which he would receive
monthly, could lie supplant Mitchell, would be
useful in his wedded state, had something to do
with his “ peaching” on the ( verseer.
Mitchell denied, on examination, that he had
spoken disrespectfully of the Super. Pressed,
however, he was obliged to admit that he had said
that the Super’s, name should have been “ Dare-
hell ” not Darrell. “But, sir,” he pleaded, “I
meant it as a compliment. You’re such a plucky
’un, sir, saving your presence, that I meant as
you’d face old Nick himself, sir, if needed.’
“ Compliment or not,” growled Super. Darrell.
“It was a liberty to take with your superior for
which there was no excuse. Unless you show
respect for the System and the men who are in
authority under it, how can you expect prisoners
to do so ? You are suspended from duty pending
the receipt of a reply to a recommendation which
I shall make to the Commandant that you bo
superseded in your post of Overseer.” Mitchell
once more retired, clearly assured that he had lost
his billet, as not once in a hundred cases did the
C.C. refuse to ratify the Longridge Superinten-
dent’s recommendations.
Darrell's good humour vanished at the dis-
closure of Mitchell’s slip of the tongue. It was
the merest of trifles ; but trivial circumstance as
it was, it sufficed to create deep annoyance. Like
all tyrants, Darrell was keenly susceptible to any
affront to his dignity. To think that these un-
couth subortlinates of his, perhaps—horrible
thought !•—even the convicts themselves dared to
pun on his name, and to make his characteristics a
jest, was to wound him in his most vulnerable
part, his vanity. The more he thought of it the
more he regretted having let Mitchell off so
slightly. He fumed and fretted in his wrath, till
the pleasing notion occurred to In's mind t at other
reports had to come in, and possibly that other
offenders might becharged and puni-lied, and that
he could vent the rest of his spleen upon them. By
a sad chance it was at Convict Tappin’s expense
that he was to regain his composure and com-
placently.
The next officer to report was the Overseer
of the Quarry Gang.
“Tappin, sir, the forger per Governor Ready,
him as got the cells last week ” began the man.
“Well, what of him, now?” snarled Darrell.
“ More talking ? ”
“ No, sir; but he’s stubborn since he came out
of the cells ; goes more slowly about his work, an’
though he don’t say nothin’ when he’s spoken to,
he takes no notice.”
The fact was that Tappin’s three days’ incarcera-
tion in the dark cells had done more to break his
spirit than all previous punishment.
“ There’ll be one man short in the tramway
team to-morrow morning. Tappin will take his
place. We’ll see if His Worship will shirk his
work when under the whip.”
The Super, objected to a nick-name when he
was its subject. .Rut none on the Island had a
stronger recollection for the bye-names and false-
uames of the convicts—and every notable scoundrel
had one or two such and none used them in inter-
course with the felonry more insolently. Tappin
he more frequently referred to as “ His Worship ”
than by his own name or register number.
With a stroke of his quill the Super, made the
entry necessary to record the transfer from “A
Gang” at the Quarry to “D Gang,” which was
formed by the tramway team.
In his heart, Super. .Darrell knew the proceed-
ing was a terribly unjust one, and that ho was
satisfying upon the ex-Mayor some of the ill-tem-
per which had been occasioned by the Mitchell
incident. He knew that membership in the D
Gang was, by a tradition of Island management,
reserved for beasts and brutes; for men with in-
describable stains upon them ; for murderers and
worse than murderers, lie knew that Tappin,
whatever his offences were, and whatever the
ignominy of his experiences in the penal colonies,
had still retained a sense of manliness which would
go far to save him, under ordinary conditions of
punishment, from descending to the lowest abysses
o r crime. He knew that every fibre of the man’s
nature would revolt against the infernal com-
panionship to which his sentence would condemn
liirn.
He knew all this, and, notwithstanding, he
made the entry in the Punishment Book :
Tappin, W. K., 18,909, Governor Ready : Insubordina-
tion and neglecting work, and offence within 7 days,
Transfer to Gang D for 12 months.
“ There,” he said, as he initialed the record, “I
think that will do for Mayor Tappin.”
Do? We should rather think it would. A
month—one brief month—of I) Gang membership
would have ruined, body and soul, any man of
average moral stamina. To a creature like Tappin,
naturally a moral invertebrate, a year signified
perdition upon perdition.
Chaplain Taylor .kept for his information and
for that of Bishop Nixon three memorandum-books,
respectively lettered in his neat hand :
Probable.
Possible.
Irredeemable (humanly-speaking).
In the first he was accustomed to enter the names
of such Protestant convicts who, so to speak, con-
stituted* the elite of his flock —the poor souls in
whom he conceived that remorse or suffering were
performing a genuine “ work of grace.” Among
the “Possible” he included the men in whose
conversation and acts he had discovered some
symptom of possible reform, some feebly-flickering
spark which the gentle breath of Christian charity
and broad humanity might fan into an undying
flame of good. In the second list he had placed
Tappin’s name. When the Chaplain heard of the
unfortunate wretch’s removal to D Gang he went
into Super. Darrell’s office and begged the loan of
a pen for a minute. Darrell courteously handed
him his own. Mr. Taylor took it, and, as he drew
a line through a “Possible ” name and entered the
same name on his “Irredeemable” list, he put a
question to the “Chief.”
“May I ask, Mr. Darrell, is this the pen with
which you recorded Tappin’s last sentence?”
“ V es,” said Darrell. “ But why do you ask !”
“ It is a coincidence, isn’t it, that the pen with
which I transfer Tappin to my list of the damned,
you should have used for precisely the same pur-
pose? ' said the Chaplain.
“You speak in riddles, Mr. Taylor,” said Darrell.
“ I keep no ‘ list of the damned,’ as you call it.”
“Oh yes you do !” retorted the parson. “ But
you call it D Gang roll, and you have put Tappin
on it!”
* * «
Not a whit did Chaplain Taylor ex-
aggerate the facts. When, at 5.30 a.tn. on the
morning following the report, Tappin filed out of
A Gang dormitory, he was ordered to shift his
blanket to that of D Gang.
He stood dazed. He hardly comprehended the
order.
“Do you hear, Tappin ?” shouted the Mustering
Warder.
“ I don’t understand, sir,” stammered No.
18,9(5!).
“ 1 spoke clearly enough, man. I will instruct
you again,” said the Warder. “Listen, now.”
And slowly, each distinctly enunciated syllable
lashing Tappin’s consciousness like a whip of
wire, the fellow (mingling with his tone of
authority an accent of d- rision) said ;
“Eighteen—nine—six—nine, I beg pardon, his
Worship—will—take - his—blanket; give it to the
Wardsman—of—D Gang; he—will then join—
D Gang- to which—he is—transferred by—the
Superintendent’s orders for neglecting—his—
work.”
Everyone in the muster yard understood what
the Mustering Warder meant by the .manner of
his speech. Warders and constables, overseers and
convicts, saw that this was the Mustering War-
der’s playful little way of conveying to “His
Worship” that the link between himself and decent
human society was to be severed. And as the
Muste ring Warder was the Senior Official present,
of course all in the yard, bar Tappin, could do
nothing less than express their appreciating of his
joke by the merriest of laughter. Power, when it
jesteth, can always find a chorus. How they did
laugh, to be sure! The cooks, in the distant
kitchen, stopped in the ladling out of the maize-
meal porridge, to laugh in sympathy, although
they didn’t know the cause for the merriment. A
fine joke, truly ! Only the robbery from a poor
mortal of the last shred of his humanity. Hence-
forth he was to be a beast; a creature with the
form of a man, but with instincts, and habits, and
the cunning of the other criminals. Henceforth
he w’as to draw as the beast draws, and bear as the
beast bears, and be whipped as the beast is
whipped, and to have no voice for his agony save
the inarticulate groan of the beast.
* * *
The members of “ D ” Gang were termed
“demons,’ in the Island vernacular, and, from
what has been already said, it will be seen that
ih • name had a greater proportion of truth than is
u ually contained in punning designation. Their
dormitory was the omnium of Vice, and they
themselves, presumably, and by reason of their
inclusion in the gang, were past-masters in crime.
If the convict population of the Island were re-
garded as constituting a Legion of Dishonour, an
Order of the Gallows, the “ D-Gangers’ were its
Grand Crosses. One simple statistical fact shows
their character. Not 10 per cent of their number
died natural deaths. By process of law, by
warder’s bullet, by the accidental or purposed
violence of fellow-felons, 01 per cent of “D
Gangers ” lost their register-mark. At this time,
they formed with three others, that dread secret
society of the “ring.” The three others were
waiting the arrival of the Special Commissioner
from Hobart Town to be tried for capital offences.
This was the amiable circle to which Tappin was
welcomed.
# * #
Members of “A” gang worked in the
quarries in irons. “D-Gangers,” as was befitting
their superior distinction, worked in double-irons.
As the. smith of “ I) ” Gang bent down to rivet
the additional anklet on Tappin’s hitherto un-
ironed log, lie found an opportunity to whisper :
“ Yer’ll hev ter join th’ King ter-night, yer
Wushup; so keep yer pluck up.”
“Never,” murmured Tappin.
“Oh, we’ll see’bout that,” grinned the fellow,
“Wo don’ ’low none in this ’ere gang unless
they’re ‘ Ringers.’ ”
Several times during the awful task-hours that
followed Tappin received similar intimations.
Overseer Crunch was lenient with the gang that,
day, doubtless in consequence of his promotion ;
at each stopping-place he gave his cattle a few
seconds’ more breathing time than usual; thus the
ruffians found time to speak to one another and to
Tappin,
To Tappin and to Gooch (the latter had got Ir’s
“ 25,” and was working with his striped and soiled
back) Crunch was particularly kind. Tiny were
the foremost of the twenty pairs which formed the
team, and would have come in for many flicking!
of the driver's enormous whip but for Crunch.
“ Driver,” he said, “ don’t give Gooch too much
to-day. He’s still sore. And his Washup’s a new
hand—we’ve got to break him to the whip gently.”
It was probably due to Crunch s “humanity”
that Tappin survived to the end of the day. Had
the full routine of the gang been manifested to
him during his first day in its strength, very
likely he v\ould have thrown himself down be-
neath the ponderous truck, and been ground to
fragments by its wheels.
Nevertheless, and lightened of much of its cus-
tomary torture as the day had been, Tappin, who
had been a man when harnessed up in the early
morning, shuffled into the barrack-yard at sunset
a desperate, maddened animal.
1 As he was lapping the greasy water which the
Establishment called ration soup, a constable noti-
fied him that Chaplain Taylor wished to see him.
“ Lor’,” cried Gooch, “ fancy a ‘ Ringer’ a par-
son’s pet!”
The exquisite humour of the idea tickled every
one. All, constables, mess-men, prisoners, swelled
the volume of hideous laughter.
“I’ll show you if I’m a parson’s pet,” shouted
Tappin, and, rising, he clink-clanked along the
pavement to where Chaplain Taylor was standing
by the yard-entrance, side by side with the
M uster-Warder.
He lifted his hand to salute the officers? No!
Rut —to strike Chaplain Taylor full in the face.
Unto this had the whip of Her Majesty’s Penal
System brought an English ex-Mayor I

“ I am sorry you did this,- Tappin,” said
Chaplain Taylor, mildly, a few minutes later, as
the unreasoning wretch was brought handcuffed
into the room where the clergyman had retired to
bathe his face. “Very sorry.”
“Damn your sorrow !” yelled Tappin ; “damn
your sympathy ! damn you ! damn ” Then
he changed his tone suddenly. “No,” he said,
‘ l l won’t curse God—yet. If you can get me out
of *D’ ward, Mr. Taylor, before ‘ silence’ bell
rings to-night, I’ll apologise, sir—l’ll apologise to
you, and I won’t curse my Maker, sir. Oh, do,
Mr. Taylor—do, sir !”
“ 1 came to tell you, Tappin, not to lose heart
—till to-morrow at least. I have already seen the
Commandant, who won't interfere with the Super-
intendent’s sentence; but tomorrow an officer’s
lady is coming with Dr. Grocott from the Settle-
ment to visit Longridge, and I will beseech her
to use her influence with the Commandant and
the Superintendent to get you removed from ‘D’
gang. An English lady will never consent to be
drawn by a man like yon.”
The Rev. Mr. Taylor had only the slightest
acquaintance with the lady he referred to—a Mrs.
Browning. Had he know her more intimately he
would not have hazarded the conjecture as to what
she would do were she offered a ride in a carriage
drawn by human beings. As a matter of fact, the
lady had already taken one such ride, and was
looking forward to the trip of the next day with
particular pleasure.
“I’ll wait, sir,” replied Tappin, tamed some-
what. “I’ll wait, sir, for a day or two, if the
Ring will let me, before ”
“ Before what ?” hopefully asked the clergyman.
“Before I give myself up to the Devil entirely!”
was the response.
* # #
On liis way homewards to the settlement,
Chaplain Taylor overtook Father M‘lndoe —best
and lankiest of priests.
In after years, Father M‘lndoe became the
object of loving reverence to a numerous section
of the Sydney population ; but no faithful son or
daughter of Mother Church held him in greater
affection than did that sturdy Anglican, Chaplain
Taylor.
Strangely dissimilar in numberless points, they
were strangely alike in two. They both had an
intense hatred of the System ; and an intense pity
for the System’s victims.
“ Well, brother,” queried the Protestant, as he
linked arms with the priest. “ Any news ?”
“No, nothing new—only another triumph for
the System,” replied the Father.
“ Body or soul ?”
“Body, this time—old Kelly, the hodman, fell
from a scaffold and broke his leg.”
“Ah, mine’s much worse. It’s a soul!” said
the Church of England parson, sadly.
