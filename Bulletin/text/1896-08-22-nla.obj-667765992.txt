EOR THE RED PAGE.
To his poetic volume (“ In Middle Harbor
and Other Yerse ”) Thomas Heney added
the other day a volume of prose—“ The Girl
at Birrell’s ” —a story which takes at once
Australian classic rank, and a permanent
shelf-place beside “Windabyne.” Of liter-
ary or general interest it has, indeed, not
much; there is no direct attempt at humor
or pathos; and the style is simple and
straightforward, occasionally elevated, oc-
casionally awkward. Yet the book has
some claim to be considered the most
characteristically Australian book pub-
lished. Its theme is the not uncommon one
of station-life in western New South Wales
a score of years ago ; the plot is a natural
and familiar plot, with numerous pauses to
describe bush scenery and bush episodes—a
storm, a shearing, a tramp lost on the track ;
the men and women are bygone types which
you must now go far afield to find. And not
alone in the sombre story, in the stiff and
sombre style, but in a certain intangible
mental atmosphere which surrounds the book,
Heney has reflected the spirit of the Austra-
lian character and the Australian landscape
as perhaps they have never been reflected
before. Some of Lawson’s sketches leave the
same momentary impression ; but Heney has
the advantage of cumulus and climax, and
his note becomes as deep and fuller—a note
of grim monotony, abiding melancholy, of
alien and inexorable Fate.
* * * *
Mr. Heney is a remarkably close observer,
with a remarkably retentive memory, and his
work is in all essentials an exact transcript
from life. He paints his figures with minute,
patient fidelity, plodding persistently on till
the canvas is covered. He has a keen eye
for colour, and a fine command of colour-
language, yet his tone is a uniform grey :
“He must paint what lies before him.”
This method of accurate description causes
Mr. Heney’s book to be uncommonly real.
With better art, it could have been made
stronger, hardly truer. The old-time bush
parson, the Sunday in the bush, the shearers
at work and play, and kindred photographs,
are all admirably done ; there is some-
thing Australian in the very feel of them ;
they have the Australian instinct and ex-
pression—the Australian “ look-out,” as it
were. Pater has a remark that thought and
style should fit as soul and body—one im-
pressing the other, the other expressing the
one—a perfect harmony. The reticence and
severity of Mr. Heney’s style are so suited
to his thought, and harmonise with the
reticence and severity of the bush and the
bushman. And the title of his book might
have been “Man was Made to Mourn.”
* * • *
And now Mr. Heney may speak for himself
of the men whom he found in the shearers’
hut at the close of the shearers’ day :
They were men of many ages, though none were
old, while some were little more than lads. Most
of them incontestably were Australian-born and
country-bred, tall, lithe, well-made fellows, faces
tanned by an unsparing climate, dark-bearded and
moustached, big and hard of hand, long-armed,
sinewy rather than full at thigh and shoulder.
Some of them were handsome in a virile fashion,
with bold and massive features, calm eyes, closed
mouth, firm jaw. Nothing of the fopling, nothing
in any degree effeminate, attach e.d to the pick
of these stalwart fellows. They looked men as
they stretched out their clean and shapely limbs in
the genial glow of the fire, and the loose shirt, as
they changed position, sank on firm outlines of
breast and shoulder; the trousers fitted closely to
the muscular leg. These were the older men,
seldom more than 40, generally 30 or a little over
—men who had shorn sheep since they were
“ Kindchen ’’—bits of lads they meant, who liked
the life and kept up their reputation as ringers”
at the board, as “toffs” in the bush public-houßes
and hamlets, as thorough good workmen, wild
devils in a spree, staunoh friends and ugly foes.
* * * •
And bo Mr. Heney goes on to complete a
picture which space will not permit to copy,
closing his chapter with a glimpse of the shed
by moonlight
It is suoh a divine night as they have in Riverina
half the lunar month throughout the winter, yet
few trouble to notice, far less to enjoy its beauty.
High in a pale-blue sky the moon seems to halt,
while not a star is near, and only the greater con-
stellations can be perceived in the mild radiance.
There is absolute stillness; not even a vague, fitful
night-wind breathes discord. . . . The whole
impression of the night was a perfect and instant
peace, commanded by Nature’s very seii.
Here was the building where all day long the
confused and painful noises of sordid labour rose
and spread. What an enchantment! Flooded
with soft light, black shadow here and there cast-
ing out high light on roof and angle, it seemed some
fairy pavilion, so graceful, so unsubstantial, that
before another glance it might be dissipated into
the elements which bodied it forth. The kind
radiance touched all; the ground seemed level,
the bush symmetrical: all that could mar the
purity and serenity of this night had been touched
with magic so that it became invisible.
* * * *
There are many such poetical passages in
“ A Girl at Birrell’s”: in fact, you almost
get Thomas Heney’s poetry better in his
prose than in his verse : he is (or was)
cramped by rhyme and metre. Such a slow,
uncouth, lumbering Muse it is who leads
his ardent soul in the painful strife for
expression ! Mr. Heney has unquestionably
a fine poetic sense : his Nature-vision matches
Wordsworth’s ; but he is all eye and no ear,
with hardly a whisper of voice. He is a
corduroy poet —bump ! —jolt ! —bump ! —yet
you get along, and the road might be worse.
And in his verse, as in his prose, he relies on
literal, truthful description for his effects. If
he had only music ! But he blunders on
with his discords and doesn’t seem to care.
In the lines “For an Anniversary of All
Saints,” he remarks :
But the Church remembers her servants only,
And strictly stated in prayer and creed
Are clauses and terms of the heavenly oovenant
By which they have won the awarded meed.
And here is a specimen still blanker :
Five years ago, a boy, I went to make
Holiday with a brother living near ;
He, first a stockman in the north, went out
Into far Queensland, and thence many times
Had brought down herds of cattle half gone wild
In deserts on the Cooper or Paroo.
This is a weary world.
* * * *
About three-fourths of Mr. Heney’s verse
are of this calibre and little weightier ; the
other fourth has lines like—
The bridle reins hang loose in the hold of his lean
left hand—
verses like—
Back from his sweat-wet hair his felt is carelessly
placed,
Handkerchief at his throat, sagging shirt round a
lank firm waist;
True to the set of strong loins the belted moleskins
are tight,
Plain from forehead to stirrup a virile vigour in
sight—
and poems like “ Drought,” “ Found Dead,”
and “A Squatter of ’68.” “At the Tank
before Day ” is not so good as some others,
but it is quotable and characteristic :
AT THE TANK BEFORE DAY.
In the air the stars are dusk, yet the slow ap-
proach of day
Makes a wan dawn in a hand’s-breadth of the
sky, '
And the twilight like a mist seems to melt and
fade away ;
Darkness yonder, only dimness is anigh.
Here few nights bring dewy cool, and the dawn
air dry and hot
Holds the senses like a languor long and deep ;
Seeing, hearing, thinking nought; past and pre-
sent all forgot,
Thus to wake, to lie, is as a dream of sleep.
Through a dry smell of the earth from the piny
bush around
Slow faint savours as of incense rise and spread,
Out afar the hills loom dark, with dim lines their
mass is crowned,
And pale the stars together blench o’erhead.
Beyond the pallid mirror of the water in the
tank,
Shapes ’twixt earth and air in twilight came
and went,
Silent, ghost-like, swift, save that as they rose
and sank
In the sullen hush a heavy noise was sent.
* * * *
Crude and faulty enough, this; but poetic—
and true. Wherefore, may we not sum up in
some lines which Robert Richardson has
written for The Bulletin ?
PAN IS NOT DEAD.
Pan is not dead : he lives (9-day
Here in our South-land, far away
From Tempe’s streams in Thessaly,
Where once he reigned in pride and glee I
And ye who list may hear him play,
By creek and cove and sunlit bay,
His slender pipes, or sad or gay,
Touching his reed-stops piercingly—
Pan is not dead.
And if perchance his Southern lay
Be fashioned in a wider way
Than shepherds heard in Arcady,
Still is it fresh and strong and free,
And wider yet Bhall grow its sway—
Pan is not dead.
R eprints.
LNot much seems to be in Australia known of Arthur
Symons, and a reoent printing upon this page of a few of
his verses has aroused several importuning Olivers. He
is one of the pretty English minors who appear in limited
editions of five hundred or so, and are generally snapped
up to the last copy by a congregation of un- or discrimin-
ating worshippers. His prose (literary and critical; often
for the Academy) does not appear to have been collected;
his verse is titled “Days and Nights” (1889),
“ Silhouettes ” (1892), and “ London Nights ” (1895). He
is an English University product, 31 years old; and his
imagination seems warming as he ages. “London
Nights,” indeed, from which most of the following are
drawn, contains some things quite too warm to be printed
in a naughty paper like The Bulletin in a nice country
like Australia—where, as editors know, there still exists
a very provincial regard for the “proprieties” of Art.
(An improper Past has so heavy responsibilities.) Perhaps
there is in Arthur Symons some taint of modern decad-
ence. But he is dexterous, and a poet, and human, and
sweet . . . and ah Eros! and O Eros! and 0 Eros, Eros!]
THE OPIUM-SMOKER.
I am engulfed, and drown deliciously.
Soft music like a perfume, and sweet light
Golden with audible odours exquisite,
Swathe me with cerements for eternity.
Time is no more. I pause and yet I flee.
A million ages wrap me round with night.
I drain a million ages of delight.
I hold the future in my memory.
Also I have this garret which I rent,
This bed of straw, and this that was a chair,
This worn-out body like a tattered tent,
This crust, of which the rats have eaten part,
This pipe of opium; rage, remorse, despair;
This soul at pawn, and this delirious heart.
PARIS.
My Paris is a land where twilight days
Merge into violent nights of black and gold ;
Where, it may be, the flower of dawn is cold :
Ah, but the gold nights, and the soented ways !
Eyelids of women, little curls of hair,
A little nose curved softly, like a shell,
A red mouth like a wound, a mocking veil :
Phantoms, before the dawn, how phantom-fair !
And every woman with beseeching eyes,
Or with enticing eyes, or amorous,
Offers herself, a rose, and craves of us
A rose’s place among our memories.
KISSES.
Sweet, can I sing you the song of your kisses 1
How soft is this one, how subtle this is;
How fluttering swift as a bird’s kiss tha’t is,
As a bird that taps at a leafy lattice ;
How this one clings and how that uncloses
From bud to flower in the way of roses ;
And this through laughter and that through-
weeping
Swims to the brim where Love lies sleeping;
And this in a pout I snatch, and capture
That in the ecstasy of rapture,
When the odorous red-rose petals par|
That my lips may find their way to the heart
Of the rose of the world, your lips, my rose.
But no song knows
The way of my heart to the heart of my roses
ESCALADE.
Tenderly as a bee that sips,
Your kisses settle on my lips,
And your soft cheek begins to oreep
Like the downy wing of Sleep
Along my cheek, and nestles smiling,
As if Love’s truth were but beguiling,
Too utterly content to move,
Only to smile, only to love.
But if, to tease you, as I use^
I feign, unthankful, to refuse
Your dear caresses, and turn cold,
Then the shy lips, waxing bold,
Advance to vanquish my resistance,
And, with a passionate persistence,
Clinging closer, fold on fold,
They suok my lips into their hold.
And if, still feigning, I resist,
Fondly feigning, to be kissed,
They wax still bolder, and begin \
Hungrily to fasten in
Upon my neck, as they would gloat
On the protesting veins that tingle
As they and your deep kisses mingle,
Your kisses burning in my throat.
But, ah ! if, lastly, I should hear
Your sudden lips upon my ear
Set my brain buzzing, and my blood
Beating the measure of your mood,
And pouring over me and under
Scented billows of soft thunder,
I yield, I’ll love you, but let be :
I yield, ere you quite murder me.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BROIL
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty or
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate re j- lel »
and to those who are subject to colds on the cues
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure, it
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri a-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
■chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. Q. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
■cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I sutteie
for upwards of seven years, during which period l wa
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the a -
culty of breathing was so distressing that for mgnts
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowle g-
merit from a sense of duty, as in my case every otner
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, ana
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose or
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALlilitt,
Balmain, Sydney." . . , „ ~
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. , _ , ...
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

59 other leading residents.

When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and 0,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
G-eorge-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing

pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious

And not too round, with short lines here and
there
To break monotony of straightness. Long
Are his straight limbs, and slender-long his feet
And nervous fingers ; and his curling hair
Is brown most soft; and his strong heart’s strong
beat
Rings out the fearless note of health. And see—
That floating thistle-seed falls not more light
Than his firm touch that sends fierce thrills through
me.
This grass knows how his heels—this grass dew-
bright—
(First of his footfall) lightly-sternly strike
And light as his free heart, rise up again.
Not lounging Paris is my hero like ;
But Mars’ rude strength, with Phoebus’ power to
pain
Or cheer with tender art, are his ; as rain
His voice is soft, as rain in August falling
On flowers softly—clear as magpie calling
Unto his mate when sunrise comes again.
I would iny tongue as Sappho’s tunefid were
To sing this lithe young native, or that air
Of his sweet breath inspired me now and near—
Then might I rhyme as Spenser of my dear.

LALAGE.
HIPPED.
The white clouds lie on a sullen ridge
And gloomily watch the dirt-gray town ;
The creek has swollen a grimy brown,
And swirls ungainly below the bridge ;
The sky’s a swamp, and the roads are mire,
And I sit by myself and kick the tire—
Damn it !
A draught crawls up from the leaky floor ;
The damp creeps out from a mouldy wall;
The wood’s burnt black, and the stuff they call
“Best Newcastle coal ” is but one fraud more ;
My nerves are stretched to the breaking-point,
And all creation is out of joint—
Damn it !
The water’s tepid, the whisky raw,
The landlord shuffles in squeaky boots ;
A long, dull blundering nerve-pain shoots
From aching temple to aching jaw;
The fire is taking a “Smoke ho ! ” spell—
I wish to God I was warm in hell,
Damn it!
J.S.S.
A REPLY.
“ Man wants but little,” said the sage,
And who will say he said amiss
That finds upon the printed page
His warm and fragrant Bower of Bliss ?
The backlogs in the fireplace hiss,
The pipes are full; the friends are true.
My summum bonum comes to this :
A pipe, a book, a friend or two,
Some rush round half the world to find
What found but Fairy gold may prove,
While others, with unflinching mind,
Toil, iron gates of Power to move.
But those who keep my quiet groove
Nor wealth nor power aspire to woo ;
But have for their impartial love
A pipe, a book, a friend or two.
“ Selfish ” you say, and bid me write
“ Songs that with self-denial glow.”
No scorner I of those who, bright
With smiles, to cheer the wretched go.
All sorts to make a world you know !
To his own kind let each be true ;
I keep to mine, dear girl, and so—
A pipe, a book, a friend or two.

Important Announcement by JDixson & Sons,
Tobacco Manufacturers,
The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a 3?riC6 HithCrtO XJll"
kIIOWH H6r6 a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Vuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d.! \ —will at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to,be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note- Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any
address on receipt of 10s. while this advertisement appears.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 1896.
The Proposed Sydney County Council.
About eight months ago, in its issue of 28th
December, 1895, The Bulletin first seriously
raised the question of establishing a County
Council to govern Sydney and its environs.
The question was again raised at greater
length in its issue of J une 6, and since then
the mattter has been taken up in other quar-
ters, until it really looks as if the movement
might result in some good for the over-
burdened city of the 40 municipalities and
the 396 aldermen. So far, however, it is
almost entirely, if not entirely, a newspaper
movement.. There is no sign of much popular
interest in the matter, and no evidence that
the public has begun to realise the advantages
of municipal federation, or is thinking about
it to any great extent. The cornstalk, unfor-
tunately, does not take his municipal institu-
tions seriously ; nor does he understand of
what immense value they might be under
better circumstances. And the people of
Sydney in particular are, in the main, placidly
contented with their ugly, tangled, common-
place city, where there is hardly one street
which keeps a straight line for 400 consecu-
tive yards ; and are blankly unconscious of
its defects, because most of them know no
other city, and have no distinct idea of what
it might be made if there was any central
authority with power and intelligence and
energy enough to undertake the work. In
short, the County Council idea falls flat
with the mass of the community, because it
hasn’t begun to realise the great want which
that institution would be especially qualified
to fill.
* * * *
The financial aspect of the case has been
already dealt with. In Sydney and its im-
mediate surroundings there are 40 munici-
palities, and 40 mayors and town clerks and
staffs of municipal officials, and 396 aldermen,
and 35 municipal debts, and 27 municipal
bank overdrafts, and almost as many separate
town-halls as there are municipalities ; and
the waste involved under this system is
necessarily enormous. The 40 councils spend
among them about £35,000 a year on salaries,
at least one-third of which might be saved by
consolidation. There is no central authority
which can undertake the lighting of the
whole area by gas or electricity supplied
from municipally-owned works ; a private
syndicate can get power to supply the whole
40 municipalities from one central establish-
ment, but if the work is undertaken—as it
should be—by the municipal authorities it
means, under the present system, the estab-
lishment of 40 separate works and the erec-
tion at ruinous expense of 40 separate plants,
therefore the existing state of things offers a
big premium to the private, syndicate and
handicaps municipal enterprise almost hope-
lessly. The debts of the suburban munici-
palities bear interest at an average rate of
over per cent., whereas a County Council
could easily consolidate them into a uniform
per cent, stock and thereby save nearly
£16,000 a year in interest alone. Moreover,
the new institution would be an affair of some
weight and dignity, and would attract the ser-
vices of able men who now hold aloof from
the squalid circumstances of suburban parish
politics. These are a few of the more imme-
diate reasons for municipal consolidation,
and they should be sufficiently weighty to
command attention. The County Council
system should save at least £50,000 a year
in useless expenses of one kind and another,
and it would open up great possibilities in
the way of municipal socialism, and make
the municipal government an institution of
almost as much value to the Democratic party
as Parliament itself.
* * * *
In addition to these immediate advantages,
there are other things to be considered. The
people of New South Wales have contrived,
by some process of perverted ingenuity, to
build probably the most crooked and dis-
reputable city of its age that can be found
upon this earth. There is hardly one street
of decent width in Sydney. There is not
one street, so far as can be gathered by an
inspection of the city map, which takes a
reasonably straight line to anywhere in par-
ticular. The shortest way from anywhere
to anywhere else is round 47 corners
and via several dozen unexpected crooks
and angles. Even in the best parts of
the city the highways wander round and
round each other in an irritating tangle.
The principal thoroughfare is so narrow that
the proposal to construct tramways in it
meets with powerful resistance on the ground
that there is no room. Among the parallel
thoroughfares, Castlereagh-street, Elizabeth-
street, College-street, Sussex-street, Clar-
ence-street, and York-street are of practic-
ally no use to relieve the pressure of traffic,
because they all come to an abrupt end at
nowhere in particular. There is not one
street which follows a straight line—or any-
thing even vaguely approaching a straight
line—east and west to give access from the
crowded wharves of Darling Harbor to the
eastern suburbs. Sydney was mostly laid
out by the primeval bullock-driver. He
made his own highways as he went, and
where he took a detour to avoid a stump 100
years ago the road was laid down, and the
principal streets of the city have been
dodging that same stump ever since. Nothing
but destruction on a large scale and exten-
sive rebuilding will ever make Sydney any-
thing better than a blot on the landscape
and a disgrace to one of the finest sites upon
this continent.
» * » *
Fifty years ago the evil which the old,
besotted pioneers had done began to be re-
cognised, but it was decided that the matter
was then beyond remedy, and things were
allowed to take their course and keep on
growing worse indefinitely. Now it is" also
recognised, but the general feeling is that
any serious attempt at amelioration should
have been made 50 years ago, before the city
attained its present dimensions, and that it
is too late to make any improvement worth
mentioning. If the present state of things
is allowed to remain, in another 50 years
Sydney and its suburbs may have 800,000, or
anything up to li million inhabitants instead
of 400,000, and the bewildering tangle will
then have spread many miles further, and
the general consensus of opinion will be that
the matter should have been seriously dealt
with in 1896, when the County Council idea
was first mooted, and that in 1946 it is
too vast and too incurable to be mended.
There is no local authority which has
any power to order the abolition of
the reeking slums, or to open up the
narrow, unwholesome alleys to the sun-
light, or to prevent the construction of
new slums, or to do anything in particular
—there was one, but it dropped to pieces a
few years ago, and even at the best its
power was too limited to count for much.
And it is in this matter that the County
Council should be of most advantage. An
authority which covered the whole metro-
politan district could compel new streets
that are opened to bear some relation to the
old ones already existing, whereas at present
the municipality which makes a new street
is under no obligation to keep it in line with
the one already existing in the adjacent
municipality, but generally goes off in pure
cussedness at an angle of its own. It could
enact that all new streets should be of liberal
breadth; and it could enforce a cast-iron
building law which would limit the height of
the towering Yankee insurance-office, and
prevent the further multiplication of wooden
and galvanised-iron and kerosene-tin struc-
tures in the suburbs. And it could make
some uniformity about the paving and light-
ing arrangements, and otherwise prevent the
great casual metropolis becoming any more
crooked and misshapen and casual than it
already is.
* * * *
In addition to this, it could seriously
undertake the work of straightening up the
worst features of the disreputable city. The
undertaking is certainly not one to be done
in haste—it will probably require to be
spread over at least a century, but the fact
that it is long and arduous is no reason why
it should not be commenced at once and
carried on steadily thereafter. The County
Council, having control of the whole metro-
politan district, could make a comprehensive
plan for the improvement of Sydney, where-
as the existing councils cannot, because in
whatever direction any one of them moved it
would presently be brought up short by the
boundaries of one or other of the remaining
39 local authorities. By economies of ad-
ministration and consolidation of the muni-
cipal debt the proposed council should be
able, without any increase of taxation, to
command a revenue of £50,000 a year for
improvement purposes, and it could by a
very small increase of taxation, raise this to
£lOO,OOO. Also, it could borrow at a very
low rate, and its works of improvement, in
many cases, could be made almost self-sup-
porting. If it gradually resumed the whole
peninsula of ancient slums about Dawes’ and
Miller’s Points, and rebuilt the district with
wide, straight streets and modern habitations,
the increased rental values thus created would
probably supply a sinking-fund that would
recoup the entire outlay in a comparatively
short time. The extension of Elizabeth
and Castlereagh streets to Circular Quay,
the extension of York and Clarence
streets, the opening up of streets ex-
tending directly from Darling Harbor
to the Domain, and the straightening
of the northern end of George-street, where
the Chinese fan-tan emporiums are—all these
are works in which the additional values
created would go a long way to cover the
expense. The creation of a few wide,
straight thoroughfares through the tangled
wilderness of the western and eastern
suburbs would also be possible for an enter-
prising and well-managed central authority ;
and even the widening of George-street,
though it would necessarily be a work of
stupendous cost, is not impossible. A muni-
cipal body deriving its revenues from a popu-
lation of over4oo,ooo people, which population
may increase four-fold before the last of the
people now living have passed away, could do
wonders with the City of Dreadful Angles if
it went at the work patiently and economi-
cally, and kept continually doing something
without trying to do too much at once.
* * * *
The reconstruction of Sydney would cer-
tainly be a work of time, but as the County
Council would have all the time there is to
do it in that objection is not worth consider-
ing. If it can be shown that the work could
be done in anything short of eternity, then
the possibility of it is sufficiently demon-
strated. Unfortunately, however, the move-
ment for municipal union—if it is worth call-
ing a movement —is being run so far on small
parochial lines, and the small municipality
which only owes £ll6 3s. 4d. is already
rising to ask how much it would lose by com-
bining on even terms with the one which
owes £12,637 19s. 7d. The most important
aspect of the case—that municipal union
would open up a possibility of reconstructing
the miserable, crooked, unkempt metropolis,
and converting it by degrees into something
worth calling a capital has hardly even
begun to be heard of. Yet that, in The
Bulletin’s opinion, is the great reason why
the County Council should be created, and,
if it isn’t to be created with that end in view,
its existence really doesn’t matter very much.

best approximation to an articulate national voice we
have ever had to shout for us. So your puff of a
lecture-agent (I forget his name, but it doesn’t matter)
galls me. This particular agent, when I saw him at Rev.
Clark’s door the other evening, looked to be a kind of
animated Butting Billy, with a d d calculating eye.
Very useful sort of person, doubtless ; but why allow him
to publicly peacock that enormous tale of Advt., as if
the clever men whose admission-tickets he has collected
were ciphers sans his parasitic I ?
* * » *
The par. goes on to dub Rev. Clark “ first and best of
the lecturers.” Now, misled by press notices, I wasted
an evening on Clark not long ago. (Subject: Dickens-
one of my earliest and dearest friends.) I heard him to
the bitter end : couldn’t get away ; for I was hemmed in
by a protuberant fat woman whom the lecturer amused
so vastly that I sat in constant dread of annihilation—
every moment expecting that she would burst her corsets
and slop over and overwhelm me. And—having escaped
by the mercy of the fat woman’s Providence—l walked
home asking myself is this the Rev. Charles Clark ? is
this “the king of lecturers”? is this the honored of
critics ?—this affable elderly gent, in dress-suit and deco-
rative watch-chain ; this amateur actor with one voice
one set of mannerisms, one ditto attitudes, one cheerfully
inflexible countenance, striving to pourtray a dozen char-
acters in monologue ; this repertory of flat observations
and stale allusions ; this mnemonic machine ; this Bore ?
Did I sleep ? did I dream ? or had fear of the fat woman
paralysed my intelligence ?
* * * *
I didn’t know ; so I wasted another evening. Again
Dickens ; but I dodged the fat woman. And the esti-
mate ? the result ? Precisely the same. I eyed the lec-
turer narrowly ; heard his every syllable ; weighed his
lightest comment; and came away convinced that Rev.
Clark is a Presence, a Voice, a Memory, and not an atom
more. Of course, he knows his authors and their com-
mentators—that is a matter of so many days’ reading at
so many hours a day. But he never, in my hearing
rose once from the respectable rut of tradition ; he never
made one original remark, never illuminated his subject
by one gleam of thought or insight : his enthusiasm was
tame, his criticism unenlightened, his platitudes Awful
A priori, to be sure, one might have guessed as much
Would people crowd so to hear a really brainv lecturer?
Did they so crowd to hear Proctor— successful though
Proctor admittedly was ?
* * * *
But pass brains : admit the monstrous proposition that
“ the king of lecturers ” should be a mere phonograph •
and Clark fails again. For he isn’t a phonograph, and
he isn’t an actor : lie is an intruding Presence who comes
between you and the author, between you and the charac-
ters, and complicates the Idea of Dr. Marigold and the
Idea of Bob Cratciiit with the Idea of a stout and rather
festive old gentleman with plenty of watch-chain. Now,
a lecturer—not a critic, that is, or a thinker, but aglorified
penny-reader of the Clark type—should be either Water
or Wine. He should either seem an absolutely colorless
medium, through whom an author’s dramatis personae are
made visible to your mind without the least distortion or
refraction ; or he should lose himself altogether, and
actually be th e personae to the last tittle, so that for the
time the illusion is perfect, and the talent of the lecture!
completes the author’s expression, transfigures his pic-
ture, and brings the audience, as it were, into the arcana
of his mind to see his creations as himself sees them—
warm with color, palpitating with Life.
* * * *
This, of course, is asking that a lecturer shall win the
actor’s effects without the actor’s mask and buskin—
seemingly an impossible feat. Yet I have known several
raconteurs and reciters who could represent two or three
characters to the life —merely by voice, and gesture, and
facial expression—so that you wholly forgot the medium ;
and I have known one mimic who could represent seem-
ingly an endless succession of characters with a similar
result. But Clark halts half-way ; he destroys the illu-
sion of Dickens’ words without substituting an illusion
from his own personality. His attempts to imitate Sophy’s
voice, or to screw his jolly red face into the similitude of
old Scrooge, are merely grotesque. Yet he is “ the king
of lecturers ! ” Bah !
* » * *
When you read Dickens— so strenuous is his vitality, so
nn e his faculty of picturing things with words—you can
often get into absolute mental contact with him : the
printed page, the vehicle of transmission, releases its
images at a glance : the epithets sing and flash : the
sweet alive sentences come trooping’ past, cinctured with
sound, now a gay figure, now a grave—here a tumbled
Bacchante, the imprint of a wine-kiss on her mouth;
there a Seer august and slow ; yonder a merry Child, yet
with eyes troubled by the primal melancholy of Being.
And from each to each is tossed the leaping Thought,
pregnant with sad Joy or smiling Sorrow, till you too,
forgetting Time and Space and the barriers of Souls,
become one with the thronging multitude, are swept
hither and thither by the breath of the Writer’s
genius, and merge every rill of self in the Ocean of his
magnificent ecstasy. But Clark !— Clark takes the
Bacchante’s arm, and straightway she is a draggled Mag-
dalen to be prayed over at a Night Refuge ; lie kneels
before the Seer, who trips and falls headlong ; he speaks
to the Child, and all its grace of childhood goes. And the
tender Thought, escaping from the desolation of this
change, falls into a thicket of platitudes and is mired out
of knowledge or vanished utterly. Yet Australian criti-
cism has never whispered this. Wherefore I rage.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Social Purity Item.
One “ Richard Arthur ” —understood to be a
physician—tackles “ the social evil ” from a new
standpoint in Sydney Telegraph :
Sir,—The statement made by me at the Centenary Hall
yesterday afternoon that there were probably 10,000 girls
and women seduced in this colony every year may be
thought a gross exaggeration, and, therefore, I would ask
space in your columns to explain why I am afraid it is not.
This estimation is based on a calculation of probabilities,
for, of course, it is impossible to obtain accurate know-
ledge on the matter. The figures for the starting point of
the calculation are found in the number of illegitimate
births. These amounted in 1894 to 2437. Now, it might
be hastily concluded that this also represents the number
of cases of seduction ; but a little consideration will show
the error of this. First of all, a certain number of births
are not registered. This number may not be very large ;
but it comprises all the infants who are done away with
immediately after birth, and the greater proportion of
those who are handed over to another person for a similar
purpose. As stillborn children are not registered, they
also go to swell the total. But a much more important
consideration is the number of children who are destroyed
before birth. Here again it is impossible to arrive at an
accurate estimate, but the number may be set down as
very large.
I feel certain that if these various causes which lead to
non-registration were not at work, the illegitimate births
every year would amount to over 3000.
The next step is the most important, and perhaps the
most difficult of all. It is this —that only a small propor-
tion of those seduced become mothers. It is impossible
here to go into the reasons, medical and otherwise, which
lead to this conclusion. lam confident, however, that it
is a low estimate which states that only a third of those
who run the risk of maternity actually incur it. This at
once brings the numbers to about 10,000.
As the great aggregate dirty saint will pre-
sently rise up with the Social Gimlet in his
hand and begin to howl over this theory, and to
talk more than ever about the age of consent,
The Bulletin respectfully asks Mr. Richard
Arthur to consider his own figures a little and
see where they get to. In the first place, the
New South Wales illegitimate births for ’94
are returned at 2393 instead of 2437—n0t that
the difference matters much. Then Mr. Arthur
reckons only one illegitimate child to each
seduced female, and he also reckons seduced
females to each illegitimate child. Therefore,
when that frequent individual John Smith
states in the court, as he often does, that he is
living with Sarah Jones, to whom lie isn’t
married, and they have six children, Sarah
Jones thus becomes 20 seduced females in one
act. If they have three children then she is 10
seduced females; if they have eight it follows that
she is 26 and a fraction fallen women all at once.
On a high estimate 10,600feinales attainthesedu-
cible age in N.S. W. every year—taking that
age as an average anywhere between 15
and 25 and the statement that 10,000 of
them are seduced leaves only 5 per cent, of
moral women in the province. Any saint who
says that he believes this, and yet ventures to
marry in N.S.W., is evidently a person who
doesn’t care much what sort of person he
marries. Further, illegitimacy applies almost
wholly to unmarried women ; the married
woman’s child may not be legitimate, but the
fact seldom comes to light. Allowing for this,
if 10,000 girls and women are seduced in
N.S. W. every year it really would seem that
more girls are seduced than are available. At
all events, 40 years of this sort of thing would
lead to the seduction of 400,000 females, which
is a truly dreadful thing in a province where
there are only 360,000 females over the age of
10 years. And considering that there are
only about 10,600 girls, and only 10,200 un-
married girls, every year attaining the
age (17) when seduction becomes common,
and 10,000 of them are seduced, it seems a
pity that Richard Arthur, Esq., didn’t con-
trive, if only for the sake of symmetry, to write
the whole lot down as seduced. The balance
seems hardly worth preserving when the case
might have been made so much stronger by
running them all in together.
“The Burns Myth.”
“ Tom Collins ” writes to The Bulletin :
This hypercritical disparagement of Robert Burns— a
healthy reaction in the first place, but now tiresomely
conventional—has far overstepped justice. It is scarcely
reasonable to compare the motley word-garb of his pro-
vincial lays with a century-end standard, which the nobly
rebellious spirit of that poetry has done much to make
popularly attainable. If his verse is often slovenly his
thought is not so. To his present critics, “ A man’s a
man tor a that ’ may appear as a platitude clothed in
doggerel ; but the song, when first written, embodied the
greatest discovery of modern times. The magnitude of
that discovery may best be apprehended by considering


what a terrible thing it was to be brought up under
Cotter’s Saturday-Night conditions —brought up in the
literal and hair-raising fear of an anthropomorphic
Phantasm such as Paganism has seldom evolved ; a Ruler
whose arrangements for the eternal future were aptly
prefigured in the present life by that hopelessly - in-
scrutable dispensation which had told off a few actors in
the world-drama to extract the third nettle and call it
rent, and a few million others to work in sleet and muck
and humility for 16 hours per diem on the rascalliest
variety of brose, with the option of being transported
with thankfulness, or of sulking in the collar. It
was something for Burns, of his own initiation, to
detect, impeach, and laugh to scorn this devil-worship
which, as the mawkish saying g'oes, he had learned at his
mother’s knee. Booth’s cab-horse standard stands out in
sinfully luxurious contrast with the lot of the Lowland
agriculturist in an era which, according to Thorold
Rooers, witnessed the nadir of the peasant’s condition ;
and, of those squalid millions, Burns alone gave articulate
challenge to the system he had been taught to revere.
Across the border, his contemporaries, Oowrer and
Crabbe, both exceptionally humane men, and both writing
copiously of the poor, have no protest against the un-
natural social-economics of the day. It is the Lord’s
doing, and it is marvellous in their eyes —that’s all.
Burns’ sister (Isabel, was it not?), who lived far into the
present century, could not read or write; and this —not-
withstanding the equivocation of glozing biographers of
the Morris type—because the right-thinking guid-man,
in a spirit of child-sacrifice reminiscent of BAAL-worship,
had seen to it that his plebeian daughter should have no
notions above her station. Think, now, through what
thickets of moral obstruction, and through what sulphur-
fumes from the Gehenna of his fathers this warm-blooded
prophet burst, seeking the light of day ! If he sometimes
felt, and oftener affected, loyalty to an order of things at
which his higher thought revolted, it was because no
man can be always at his best. If he lunched with Sar-
good whenever lie got the chance, it was because in his
day there was no democratic etiquette—no democracy,
indeed—and the resilient manhood which equally resented
insolence and condescension was well balanced by a frank
camaraderie toward man as man. If his light no longer
dazzles, it is because the torch taken from his dead hand
has found worthy bearers. But whilst he lived, the fitful
inspiration of the fearless truth-seeker was upon him.
Appealing to the emotions, as his contemporary, Paine,
appealed to the reason, he stands in history as one of
society’s redeemers. And if he did flirt with two vocabu-
laries, and manufactured rhymes ad arbitrium, the
licentia vatum, though admittedly malum in se, was. in
reality no more en dehors de saison than our own weaving
a soupgon of Latin or French into our text, as per pi esent
example. Scribendi reete sapere est et principium et funs,
as we say when we try to show off.
The “ Humorous Side of the Business.”
The visit to Australia of certain agents of a
great English co-operative society has moved
the Australasian to let off a few remarks
about the general eussedness of Protection :
But there is a humorous side to the business which will
probably strike the delegates from Manchester, whether
they speak of it or not. Men are found admitting that it
is a fine thing for us to be able to dump as much produce
as we like on the shores of Great Britain, and at the same
time denying it to be a good thing that we should take
her commodities in an equal spirit of free interchange.
The fair play which is said to be bonny play is absent
here. But our protectionist absurdities hurt ourselves
much more than they can hurt the mother country. Every
business man must know that our exports can be paid for
only in imports. If we will persist in taxing our imports
heavily through the Customs we receive less for our ex-
ports than we should otherwise obtain ; the loss falls on
ourselves, and especially on the producer, who must be
able to live cheaply if he is to compete successfully in the
markets of the world. If we send produce to Man-
chester, can it be a good thing wilfully to diminish the
value which Manchester sends us in return ?
This sort of thing, which the Argus and Aus-
tralasian are constantly getting off, is good
enough in a large, loose sort of way, but how
does it look when we get down to particulars?
Britain levies an enormous tax on Victorian
wine, brandy, raisins, and other fruits, and
calls it Freetrade; why should not Victoria
levy duties on British produce in return and
call it Protection or anything else she pleases ?
Britain raises almost as large a proportion of
her revenue from Customs duties as Victoria
does, though the duties are differently distri-
buted ; why then should she be held up as a
bright and shining example ? Also, where does
the want of fair play come in, and what is all
the row about? Also, how, or by what possi-
bility does “every business man know that
our exports can be paid for only in imports,”
when in Victoria alone about £2,000,000 worth
of exports per annum are paid for simply by a
receipt for the interest on the public debt ?
What kind of a business man is it who doesn’t
know this ? Moreover, Victoria does take
British goods quite as freely as Britain takes
Victorian goods, provided Britain sends the
kind Victoria most wants —that is, specie.
Britain also only takes the kind of goods she
wants, so the two things are equal. Further,
leaving specie out of the question and dealing
only with other goods, Victoria takes very
nearly as much from Britain as Britain takes
from her, so again, what is the row all about ?
And if “ the loss falls on ourselves,” what has
Britain got to grumble at ? Again, if exports
are paid for only by imports, then supposing Vic-
toria sends £IOOO worth of goods to England it
naturally follows that England sends £IOOO
worth back, whether the country they are sent
to is Freetrade or Protectionist. So unless the
Australasian really means that the English
exporter looks up the tariff, and —when he finds
that Victoria is a Protectionist country—posi-
tively refuses to send more than £BSO worth of
goods or specie back, and that Victoria stands
this kind of thing, the statement that a Protec-
tionist country receives less in exchange than a
Foreign-trade one is sheer imbecility. And, in
any case, if there is to be “fair play” and
“ free interchange ” and sich, shouldn’t Britain,
which advocates free interchange, set the ex-
imple—not Victoria, which doesn’t advocate it ?
The Desolation of Sydney.
In view of Premier Reid’s cheerful assurances
of a very few weeks ago as to the diminution of
poverty in New South Wales, and the general
improvement in prospects, and the revival of
trade, and his assertion that the unemployed
now amount to less than 1500 all told—in view
of all these things the special report presented
the other day by the manager of the Benevolent
Asylum is doleful reading. Its general tenor is
that, in all the many years during which the
institution has existed, things have never been
so bad or so hopeless as during the last six
months —when the policy that was to make
New South Wales “ jolly and fat ” began to
get really into operation. At the end of the
half-year the institution had on its books some-
thing like 1880 persons (845 registered as “ un-
employed,” and 1035 miscellaneous destitutes)
and reckoning the families of these people the
total number receiving outdoor relief was 7330.
This takes no account of indoor relief, and it also
takes no account of the fact that there are over 30
other benevolent institutions in the county of
Cumberland alone, so that these figures repre-
sent merely a fraction of the aggregate misery
of the metropolitan district. The report fur-
ther adds that “there is every prospect of a
further increase ” in the number of the Asylum s
dependents. Since this was written the fore-
cast has been fully verified ; for, whereas the
half-yearly report sets forth that things had
never before been so bad in Sydney since the
institution existed, the monthly report for July
states that they have since become a great deal
worse, and that the persons receiving outdoor
relief and their families have suddenly increased
to about 9400. In the face of these statistics
it is about time to throw up the ghastly pretence
that things are getting better, or even that they
are not getting a good deal worse, in the Golgotha
by the Beautiful Harbor. Last year the popula-
tion of Sydney anditssuburbs decreased by 15,100
people —the first decrease recorded for more
years than this generation can remember. The
value of city and suburban property, as shown
by the municipal valuations, went down with a
thud such as even Melbourne in its burst days
hardly excelled. The aggregate amount of em-
ployment decreased woefully; all the faked
statistics of the rotund Premier can’t dissipate
the evidence on this head contained in the
Benevolent Asylum reports. The record suicide
year, so far back as Cogiilan’s statistics go,
was 1895 ; not only was it the year when the
actual number of suicides was largest, but it
was also the one when a larger proportion of
the population suicided than ever before —in
other words, New South Wales was evi-
dently a better place to get away from in
’95 than at any other period of its recent
history. And 1896, so far as available
evidence goes, is even worse than ’95. There
has been a liberal shutting-up of factories
through the beneficent operation of the Foreign-
trade system. Pauperism, as shown by the
Benevolent Society’s figures, has largely in-
creased. The sugar-industry has decided to
gradually peg out. The State revenue for the
first month of the new financial year reveals a
large decrease. The trade reports in the Sydney
morning papers tell the same invariable story
that “ business shows no marked improve-
ment,” and have been telling it for many
months past. About one-third of Sydney is
for sale at greatly reduced prices, and more of
it is to let, probably, than ever before. Alto-
gether, if there is any bright spot in the imme-
diate future of New South Wales it is nowhere
apparent, and even the most flippant politician
seldom looked out over his vast stomach at a
more dreary prospect.
The Coolgardie Water Problem.
Apparently the Westralian Government must
tackle the question of a water-supply for Cool-
gardie and its surroundings, because Coolgardie
is the centre of the great boom which keeps
Westralia alive ; yet the scheme bids fair to be
one of the worst white elephants on this con-
tinent. It will cost about £2,500,000; and the
annual outlay for interest, maintenance, &c., is
estimated at £320,000. To earn this the
Government expects to sell five million gallons
a day at 3s. 9d. per 1000 gallons, equal to
£329,000 a year. But there are awful diffi-
culties in the way. It is estimated that two
million gallons a day will be bought for domestic
purposes, which will require a population of
nearly 100,000 ; and that three million gallons
will be taken by the mines, which estimate is
based on the assumption that 300 batteries of
20-heads each will be going night and day.
But, at present, there is no sign of more than
one-tenth of that battery-power being wanted,
and if the batteries don’t come the 100,000
population can’t live there, and, between these
two circumstances, it is just possible that the
revenue will be nearer £30,000 a year than
£329,000. If this should come to pass, and it is
quite possible, then the shortage will swallow
up one-sixth of the Westralian revenue in one
act. Moreover, it is quite possible that the
abundance of water will destroy the roaring gold-
boom for good and all—most of the mines live on
the fact that they can’t crush and thereby prove
their utter barrenness, for want of water ; and
as the pound water-supply comes in
the people who are to pay for it may simply
rise and go out. Apparently they can’t live
decently without it, and very likely it will
make it practically impossible for them to live
at all. Moreover, if the requisite 100,000
people are forthcoming to use the water they
will be much more than half the population of
the province, and they must get adequate repre-
sentation some day, and when they do they
will almost certainly insurrect against the tre-
mendous charge of 3s. 9d. per. 1000 gallons, and
insist on charging a large part of the expense to
the general revenue. Therefore, if Coolgardie
and Kalgoorlie don’t succeed the old identities
will have to pay the bill for water-supply to the
hated t’othersiders. And if they do succeed,
the old identities will probably have to pay a
large part of the bill. Perhaps the final use of
the great water-supply will be to irrigate the
plains so that Chinamen may grow onions there,
to be humped by an insolvent railway to Perth
and thence exported to Sydney.
A Northern correspondent to The Bulle-
tin :
The town of Bundaberg (Q.) is the scene of many
, strange sights. It may be described geographically as
bounded on the north, east, west, and south by r.he genial
Kanaka. At every roadside corner the black brother is
in force—especially on Sundays—waiting with his bow
and arrows, ready for fight. The Kanaka is the pride and
victim of the sky-pilot of every denomination, barring the
Papal one. lie generally finds at the end of the year that
he has left to him more religion than sense and less money
than either. If by chance he gets free from the heavenly
harpies, he has to face the harpies in the town. These
volunteer to keep his cash in safe custody profitable
business. The mortality amongst Kanakas in the Bunda-
berg district is so high, and the “morality” is so
low, that it is a safe thing to borrow any
nigger’s money at ten per cent, (promised). Nine
out of ten take out principal and interest in grog,
women, or other accommodation, or die before they de-
mand it. In one recent month two Bundaberg store-
keepers were committed for trial for alleged larceny
as bailees of kanakas’ money. The niggers, of course,
have open to them the Govt. Savings Bank ; but, like
their white fellow-residents, they seem to dislike trusting
Q. Govt. They seem to think Govt., Polynesian Dept.,
Savings Bank, and missionary stations are all run on the
same lines as parts of the same comprehensive swindle.
The other day, at the Polynesian Office at Bundaberg-,
about 1)0 kanakas presented themselves to be paid. One
“ boy ” “ no-saveed ” his name. lie was stupid in his
speech and appearance. A brother kanaka explained that
there was a man on the .verandah of the office outside
vending liquor to the niggers departing with their money
The middle distance of the picture was made up of the
vile white women plentiful in Bundaberg, pleading for
their share of the golden harvest reaped by the Polynesian
saviours of Queensland. In the background hovered a
black-coat. Doubtless the kanakas found all appropriate.
To them, Rum, Harlots, and Religion are Queensland s
blessed trinity, with a “good-fella Guv’ment” paternally
smiling over all.
In the latest Alert case of Ponting v. Huddart
PARKEKandCo. threeof the jurymen were, admit-
tedly, seen drinking with two of the defendants’
lawyers at Menzies’ Hotel. Doubtless there
was nothing deplorable in this incident, but it
reminds The Bulletin of another Melbourne
law-case —a famous will-suit —tried by a special
jury, whose foreman invited one of the counsel
engaged to lunch with him at the same Menzies’
Hotel whilst the struggle wa,s proceeding.
Also, in that instance the jury gave a verdict
for the friendly counsel’s client—such a “bad”
verdict that the winner made a modest com-
promise with the loser to avoid a new trial.
Melbourne barristers and solicitors —especially
the latter—show an undue affection for jurymen,
anyway. In the course of Speight v. Syme a
juryman died. His last illness was soothed by
much chicken and jelly and things from the
hands of at least one legal gentleman engaged
upon the joh. The dainties used to be brought
every morning, with best wishes for a speedy
recovery of the patient and an honest verdict to
follow. And when at last the juryman went
where there is no more jelly both of the rival
legal parties mourned for him as a brother.
One of the saddest things The Bulletin has
seen in print for a long while is this item from
Sydney Evening News :
There is good news from various sources pointing to
the probability of considerable industrial revival in the
near future. For one thing it is announced that Mr.
Joseph Mitchell has formed an English syndicate for the
establishment of ironworks in New South Wales, and, for
another, the British co-operative delegates just arrived
here have been talking in a way that seems to foreshadow
increase of business.
The British co-operative delegates are looking
for supplies of all manner of food products to
sell to their customers. And N.S. W., which
imports great quantities of cheese, flour,
eggs, fish, fruit, barley, maize, oats, wheat,
hops, jams, jellies, cattle, malt, bacon, hams,
milk, molasses, potatoes, onions, salt, straw,
timber, tobacco, and even vegetables, because
it somehow can’t, under the Freetrade system,
grow its own supplies, reckons that their visit
will somehow open up a profitable business in
something—no one knows what. And the
other cause of joy is that an English co. is
thinking of starting iron works in N.S. W., and
the cornstalk will probably be allowed to hump
the heavy loads at a low wage, and be a beast
of burden in his own country for an English
master. And he is down so low that he calls
this “good news.”
The Parliamentary pressure exerted upon
N.S.W. Government to extend the period
allowed for the re-appraisement of “special
areas,” chiefly on the plea of ignorance of the
law, and to abolish the 10 per cent, fine upon
such holders of such areas as are behind with
their payments, has to collide with the legal
axiom that every citizen is supposed to know
the law, every law, every bit of every law, and
that ignorance is no tenable excuse. Besides,
as “ Lands ” Carrutheks has pointed out, there
has already resulted, by re-valuation of lands, a
loss of £900,000 to the N.S. W. revenue. The
clamor of the agitators is tolerably comprehen-
sive : (1) District surveyors, who make valua-
tions, are not experts in valuing; (2) land
boards decline to receive expert evidence as to
values ; (3) the expert evidence that is received
is unreliable. Yet it only means, on behalf of
the proposed beneficiaries : Holders don’t want
to pay anything more than they can help, and
don’t want to pay that much until they are
forced to do so. But they hold on to the land
and din noises into the ears of local members.

Writes “ Treble B. ” :
Dear Bulletin, —In his note on the N.S.W. land ad-
ministration “ Stump-Jumper” touches the spot, and his
conclusion, “the land administration is rotten,” will
receive an emphatic endorsement from thousands who
are galled by the lack of ordinary business courtesy and
the bureaucratic indifference to the public convenience,
characteristic of that administration. Little is heard
publicly of the matter, for the simple reason that it
emphatically doesn’t pay the man settled on the land to
incur the ill-will or animus of any part of the administra-
tion, and grievances can only be ventilated anony-
mously. “ Stump-Jumper ” is of opinion that things
will be righted when we get practical men at the
head of the departments. Rather an optimistic opinion,
I fear. A strong man might do somewhat, but a man
strong enough to tone down the arrogance and remove
the inertia of the Lands Department might be Premier.
In the conduct of public business the Post Office Depart-
ment and the Lands Department may stand as examples
of how to do it and how not to do it, and this notwith-
standing that the P.M.G. is always the lame duck of the
Ministry, whilst the Minister for Lands is just as invari-
ably the second in charge. This would go to show that
the difference in the two departments arises from some
factor within the departments, and is not the effect of, or
affected by, Ministerial control. Which factor may be
that the P.O. is administered by the common people for
the common people, and that the Lands Department is
administered by a professional class with the usual regard
to their own convenience and arrogance to outsiders so
often characteristic of members of the professional
classes when beyond the control of direct public competi-
tion. Be this as it may, the Minister for Lands who can
convert his Department to “civility, punctuality, and
despatch ” will confer a lasting boon on the State tenants.
In the meantime the administration is rotten.
Practically, the N.S. W. law of divorce recog-
nises that a marriage under false pretences
comes within the recognised statutory ground
of “desertion.” The other day, Cohen, J.,
granted a decree nisi, returnable in two months,
to a wife who supported her allegation of
“ desertion ” (according to a daily paper’s re-
port) by stating that her husband, before the
marriage, had styled himself “a general ser-
vant ” ; but he did not seem to be able to do any-
thing, and never worked at all. She supported
him by going out as a general servant, and he
never found her a home.” If this constitutes
“ desertion,” a wide field is open to divorce
lawyers. Male Impecuniosity frequently
marries Foolish Female Competency, and never
works for her, nor provides her with a. home.
In fact, Female Hunger buys its Male Food at
a price. If the law for the rich be theoretically
the law for the poor, then must also the Coiien-
ese law for the poor, as m the case illustrated
above, be the Cohenesk law for the rich. Here
is a large hitherto unexploiled field. Only the
other day, when a domestic fracas was ventilated
in a Sydney suburban police-court, the male
defendant admitted airily: “I married her
because she settled ,£2OO a year on me.” This
case is not on all-fours with that under con-
sideration, but the possibilities of married con-
ditions coming easily within this latest inter-
pretation of divorce-law should be interesting
to a lively legal imagination.
Graham was asking in Yic. Assembly the other
night whether the acting railway commissioners
had employed stevedores on the Murray and
elsewhere; whether shippers were charged
with the cost; whether a certain carrying firm
(named) was favored re said charges ; whether
what they paid, if they paid anything, was
refunded ; whether favored individuals as far
as wool-freights are concerned exist in the
neighborhood of Linton ; what the reasons are
for the seeming favoritism, &e. All which, if
soundly based, points to the danger of our
importing the baneful American system of
preferential freights, which are so effectually
crushing out the American farmer and com-
pelling him to fly to Populism to get some
alleviation. Possibly a dividend-mill might
justify itself ; but can a popular Government?
Victorian Public Service needs overhauling
and re-classifying—just as does every big ser-
vice every few years. Promotion by seniority
means that many men get billets they can’t
manage, and a re-arrangement of duties follows
as the night the day. Further, the tide of
public business changes and leaves men stranded
without work, or overflows them. The boom
meant expansion of the Titles office work—
complete alienation of the land means an idle
Lands Department—&c., &c. Even M’sP.
know this. But does the Vic. Public Service
Board commence attacks on service anomalies—
taking stock of wasted energies? No. It
issues an order that lunch-time must be strictly
limited to half-an-hour, institutes time-books
for the lunch-time, regulates that the officer
who carries a sandwich in his pocket must note
the time lie begins eating and the time he stops ;
that another officer must certify the fact, and
that the time-book shall be sent for inspection !
The result is a flutter for a fortnight, and one
civil servant is threatened with the sack. O
monstrous ! but one half-pennyworth of sack to
this intolerable deal of lunch-time.
In its broadest sense “ local option ” is soundly
democratic. It is, in fact, a mere extension of
the principle of “ local government,” a prin-
ciple that has scarcely an audible opponent. But
teetotallers run their “ local option ” movement
in the narrowest instead of the broadest sense.
Their case is ex-parte Cold Water. They only
seek local option votes as to whether public-
house licenses shall be numerically decreased or
standstilled. Bung, in S.A. and N.S.W. is
now moving in a counter-direction. Bung is
agitating for a “ local-option ”,vote upon “ Sun-
day-opening,” as against the adopted (but con-
temptuously-fractured) law of the land. Bung’s
position is at least as logical as Pop’s. A free
people should have a right to say what it may
or may not drink at any time. The case, how-
ever, is not merely one of Bung v. Pop. It is
the People v. Bung and Pop. And the local-
option vote should be possible, in certain locali-
ties, concerning the question of Night Licences.
Ex-Governor Norman’s Queensland dinner
speech in London, regretting that Federation
will dwarf the Australian provinces into lieu-
tenancies, contains that kernel of unpalatable
fact which makes numbers of provincially-pro-
minent people oppose or throw cold water upon
every practical attempt to constitute an Aus-
tralian nation. - First, as General Norman
says, away will go the Governors. Next, away
will go all but one of the Chief Justices. Then
the Premiers will dwindle to something the size
of mayors, and away will go half the Parlia-
ments, their officers, and belongings. In fact,
considering the shrinkage of dignity and emolu-
ments which must necessarily take place in
each province on the coming of Federation, the
wonder is that the self-protective instinct of
mediocrity does not inspire a fiercer hostility.
And perhaps it would, were not mediocrity in
general so fatuously vain as to think that it
will be as big a man in Australia as it is in
Hog’s Gully.
There are some suggestive points in the follow-
ing, addressed to The Bulletin by a legal
correspondent :
When a prisoner has been convicted after trial, the
record of his previous convictions, if any, is duly read
out, ostensibly for the purpose of guiding the sitting
Rhadanianthus in passing sentence. Wilson or Butler
had just pleaded “ not guilty ” to a charge of highway
robbery under arms, when an arraignment for simple
larceny was straightway made against him, to which he
pleaded “guilty.” Thereupon the Crown got its little
chance, and chucklingly proved a record of convictions in
Victoria and elsewhere involving 63 years of sentences —
some, of course, concurrent. Jurymen in court listened
to this damnable iteration, and must thereby have been
more or less prejudiced against the prisoner when im-
mediately afterwards he was put on trial for the graver
offence with the pistol. The record of convictions
should in all fairness have been withheld pending the
hearing of the more serious charge. Even a ruffianly
criminal like Butler should have fair play when the stake
is his life. The shadowy case against him (it now
appears that he was guilty all the same) was quietly
brushed aside by the prisoner, who ably defended himself.
Nor did Judge Holroyd’s impartial summing-up at all
injure the man’s common-sense defence of want of reason-
able identification, which the jury without hesitation
accepted. Here let it be said, however, that Victorian
Judges lay themselves open to an accusation of unfairness
when they look at the “ convictions attached to the pre-
sentment” while prisoner is on his trial. The jury is
not allowed to see these, but it may be pertinently asked
why the Judge should see them either. If the Judges con-
fined themselves to an exposition of the law bearing on the
case, there would be little harm in this proceeding. But,
unfortunately for themselves and for the fair spirit of an
impartial community, most of them usurp the undoubted
functions of the jury by debating the evidence step by
step in their charges. Knowing of those previous convic-
tions, prejudice infallibly steps in, and warps, insensibly
it may be, the judicial deliverance to the jury. When it
is laid down as a legal axiom that the jury should know
nothing of the antecedents of a prisoner before delivering
the verdict, in order to secure absolute justice, should not
the same abstinence be demanded of the Judge, and
especially of the Judge who comments freely upon the
facts, acting indeed as 13th juryman ?

The Australian Star put up a record
last Tuesday. On page 6 appeared a lurid shriek
concerning the death of one Joseph Ryder, with
big black headings, “ Kicked to Death,” “ Brutal
Outrage at Waterloo.” On page 5 appeared a
later version of the same story in which the Star
speaks in a tone of great pain as follows :
Systematic inquiries by the police into the circumstances
surrounding the death of the hoy Joseph Ryder at Water-
loo yesterday do not tend to support the theory that he
was brutally assaulted by larrikins. Every time a man is
found bruised and battered a certain section of the press
immediately put it down to a “ push,” although there
may not be the slightest evidence of the assault being
so caused. The facts in this case point to a fall
from a horse. Imaginative writers, flourishing in
certain newspaper circles, have been wont to create
mysteries where facts are not sufficiently blood-curd-
ling. It is now almost impossible for a man to
be found in a battered condition without the intro-
duction of this mystic element. What possible founda-
tion existed in the boy Ryder’s case to give rise to weird,
eerie shrieks of secret brotherhoods and sworn vendettas ?
It is not long since a man named Rae was found seriously
injured. A chance utterance in rambling delirium, as in
this case, furnished an inspiration, which was forthwith
clothed in denunciation of imaginary pushes and brutal
larrikins. This is the species of so-called journalism which
has been brought to bear in the Waterloo case.
This is a case of grabbing the difficulty with both
hands and making the best of it.

The Potter-Bellew season in Sydney com-
menced with a brief attack of “ La Tosca,” which
elegant and gentlemanly horror was well supported
by the public and received with all the enthusiasm
that such a well - appointed horror deserved.
“Tosca” is magnificent tragedy and gory and awful
murder in evening dress —not twopenny butchery
done in a cellar with an axe and the corpse left on
top of the coals, but scented homicide and the
remains afterwards set to slow music. And as the
very Nicest People like their murder, provided it
is done in a high-toned fashion, “ Tosca ” should
stand a good deal of casual revival. The drama
was gorgeously staged, and its five short acts and
four rather long intervals somehow suggested the
small flower-plots and the big, glaring paths in the
far den of a newly-enriched pawnbroker. Bellew’s
laron Scarpia was received in Sydney with
general approbation. The flour-bag-colored visage
and the vividly - painted lips of that gaudy
Sicilian produced an unnatural effect, but
Bellew’s rendering of the character was
otherwise altogether commendable. He was the
subdued and cat-like functionary that the public
expected, and whether his version of Scarpia was
or was not the best one possible, at all events it
was strictly consistent, and, having started to
crawl in one direction, it kept on crawling that
way to the bitter end. In a number of small, re-
flective ways Bellew filled in the character of his
ghoulish Scarpia and made him an artistic ruffian
of the deepest dye. Scot Inglis’s Cavaradossi was
a fine, manly character, and he and Scarpia set off
each other. No one at present on the Australian
stage could improve much, if at all, on Inglis’s
rendering of the hero whom Mrs. Potter hugs so
desperately, and a smaller man would have been
cracked in that embrace.
* • * »
As regards Mrs. Potter, the general feel-
ing, so far, is one of bewilderment. When that
lady made her last appearance in Sydney, some
years ago, the impression she left behind was that
she was wildly different from anybody else, and
she is more different now than she was
then. She spoke her Tosca with a strange
and wonderful accent (except when she for-
got the accent) which was possibly meant for
broken Italian, though why the pure Italian of the
original Tosca shouldn’t simply be translated into
ordinary English passes comprehension. The
other characters were also Italian, but none of
them struggled along in the extraordinary Potter
dialect. Her attitudes were artificial and labored
and affected ; her painted visage, with a great
mass of black at.the outer corner of each eye and
a splash of red at the inner one, was an extra-
ordinary piece of Impressionist art —the lady
looked as if she had been facially decorated
out of a bucket by the eminent Mr. Sid. Long;
she rolled her eyes painfully, and made
fearful and wonderful mouths, and had strange
adventures with her hair ; and her Tosca
was an artificial creature who couldn’t have lived,
because she would have wriggled herself to death
at an early age. And with it all there is a decided
fascination about Mrs. Potter, though her amazing
hat did strike one in the eye like a colored rocket;
most of the details of her are objectionable, but
about the whole Potter there are many undefinable
attractions. If she painted less, and struggled
not quite so desperately with herself, and gave the
amazing hat to the poor, and trusted a lot more
to Providence for small details, and wasn’t so
painfully affected and so much aware of her own
existence, The Bulletin has an idea that some-
where or somehow Mrs. Brown P. might be a
really good actress, or something near one. Apart
from the people above-mentioned, Miss Polly
Emery deserves a mention as a wild-haired boy
who was done admirably so far as he went; and
that fine old veteran, J. H. Cathcart, gave a per-
fect sketch of a casual old nobleman. The noble-
man was wholly casual, but he was a notable indi-
vidual the way Gathcart did him.

Her Majesty’s resumed business with
Harry Hodson as lessee and manager, and Charles
Holloway, brother of the well-known Billolloway,
as star. So far as the first nights go, things are
looking well with the new firm, and it is just
possible that the curse which has hitherto rested
on Sydney’s biggest theatre has begun to be used
up. The “King of Crime,” which was revived
for the occasion, is a rather deserving melodrama
in which many people are cut off in their prime.
The pathetic and beautiful blind woman gradually
falls down dead when she finds that her beloved
husband, when he isn’t leading a pastoral exist-
ence in their cottage, is head of a band of thugs
of the most gory description. The miser has pre-
viously died by justifiable insecticide, and the
wrong man has been promptly and ably run in for
the crime. Then the traitor is obliterated by a
pair of large hands—the vengeful hands of C.
’Olloway—which appear at midnight from behind
a curtain ; and the avenger is himself bombarded
to death by a large quantity of troops immediately
afterwards. Also the will, after being three times
stolen and once burnt, turns up again in the pre-
sence of a gorgeous and exceedingly wicked ballet
with pink fleshings on.
* * * *
In the “King of Crime,” vice is flattened
out with a desperate and picturesque energy which
is beyond praise ; it is not only flattened, but it is
killed and utterly smashed up with a club, and
belabored heavily after it is dead. C. Holloway
himself is the most notably weak part in the
show. He is desperately earnest with a comedy
hat on and a pair of unconvincing top-boots, and
his attitudes are mostly wooden and very depress"
ing. Still he sometimes rises to a big occasion
with some semblance of success. The co.
has a clever and very pretty leading
lady in Miss Eugenie Duggan, whose rendering
of the blind woman is an excellent piece of work
throughout. There is not very much of the blind
woman, but she appears at many critical moments,
and hears the breathing of the assassin in the
dark, and she always turns up gracefully, and
does her little bit of work in a most commendable
fashion. Willard makes a striking and very tall
villain, who sins at a great altitude like a demon
on the top of a high mountain ; and Inman’s small
Sart as the hero is sufficiently good; also J. P.
'’Neill, as a fat Irish person, has many points
about him. In fact, there is no very bad person
in the co.; the trouble is that, except for the lady
above-named, it keeps a respectable dead level
throughout, and there is no star in it worth men-
tioning. Still, the mounting is good, and the
tights of the ballet are surprising enough for any-
body.

Maggie Moore’s version of the improper
person who sat for the altogether will run at
Sydney Royal till the end of next week. The
public hasn’t begun, in any sense, to weary of
the partially unclothed heroine, nor does it tire
of Svengali and Gecko; and the Rev. Bagot—
who snuffles through the nose of J. P. West—and
Zou-Zou also maintain their hold on the affections
of the community more or less. But, all the
same, there is so very little of “ Trilby,” and so
much of what there is consists of very moderate
variety business, that three weeks should about
exhaust the possibilities of the tawdry little show
in Sydney, and but for the magnetism of Maggie
Moore and the wild hairiness of Svengali three
days would have been enough. The author didn’t
write Svengali’s hair or Maggie Moore’s feet,
therefore The Bulletin feels itself justified in ex-
pressing the opinion that that person should be
slit up lengthways, and the germs of literature
should be picked out of him and carefully smashed
with a club on a board. He hasn’t got the right
kind of germ, apparently.

Harry Rickards’ people come and go and
come again in a bewildering fashion. Sydney had
just fairly begun to regret the vanishment of the
wonderful Frantz Family from the Tivoli, and
now that amazing combination of bounders is
back again, and bounding as if nothing had hap-
pened. While they are there they comprise about
as much astonishment as the public can hold, and
the fact that Mons. Provo is also on the premises
seems hardly worth mentioning, while the pre-
sence of William Crackles is too small a circum-
stance to be alluded to. Crackles and the
others may assume their former dimensions when
the Family is gone, but at present they are more
or less eclipsed.

The new Palace of Varieties in Pitt-street,
Sydney, is to open somewhere about November
next. Phil. Goatcher is sole lessee, and Arthur
Garner manager, and G. L. Goodman will repre-
sent. the front of the establishment. Under such
management the Palace, which has been built by
“Tattersall” Adams on lavish principles, should
put up a record. Arthur Garner, who is probably
about the best-qualified man for the work who
could have been procured, has been ranging over
Europe and America gathering up the best artists
of all kinds, regardless of cost, and it is intended
that the new enterprise will go to the front on its
very first night, and stay there permanently.

The spirit of Richard B. Sheridan hovered
reproachfully around Melbourne Princess’ until
Tuesday last, when “ The Rivals ” passed away
and Mrs. Malaprop’s solemn chant was turned off
at the meter. On Saturday the modern American
rendering of old English comedy was preceded by
an alleged idyll, in one act, taken from the
French. The Bulletin’s remarks upon “Grin-
goire, or the Ballad Monger,” are tempered by the
belief that the idyll will not trouble Australia any
further. Hence there is no reason for protesting
against poet Gringoire’s doggerel wig and grue-
some countenance, or for dealing harshly with
Louis the Eleventh, although these and other
matters were very trying at the time. The
idyll is so feeble in its motive, dramatic
construction and dialogue, that fine acting would
be thrown away upon it, which possibly explains
why Nat Goodwin and Co. confined themselves to
an inferior performance. The dejected bard and
the rampageous Louis were equally unreal crea-
tions, and a few courtiers didn’t appear to know
whether they were concerned in a serious under-
taking or a Gilbertian joke.
* * * *
“In Mizzoura,” the simple, straightfor-
ward yarn of rough ’Murkan life, is having a
three-nights revival this week. On Saturday the
final week of the Goodwin season in Melbourne
will start with “ The Nominee,” and another idyll,
entitled “ Romeo’s First Love.” “ The Nominee,”
a farcical comedy, is said to be one of Goodwin’s
most popular successes, and it will introduce the
beauteous Miss Maxine Elliott to this country.
** * *
George Rignold, having wearied of wait-
ing for ‘ ‘ Cheer, Boys, Cheer ” to catch on at the
Royal, changed his bill to “ Romany Rye ” on
Monday night. The previous productions of
“Romany Rye” in Melbourne date back to the
early dawn of boom-time, when the city was com-
paratively virtuous, so it is quite likely that G. R.
Sims’ melodrama will rank as a bright memory of
the past and do large business.

Ovide Musin, likewise Madame Musin and
Edward Scharf, the most genuinely admired
trinity of music-makers that ever travelled these
parts, were heard again at the Athenaeum Hall on
Saturday night. The entertainment given by these
unassuming artists is more delightful than before in
the instrumental numbers, and as regards the
lady’s showy vocalism, it might be said that her
high notes have improved sufficiently to make up
for what seems to be a new and faulty production
of the lower ones. Ovide Musin commits none of
the unpleasant noises which other great violinists
are apt to scrape as evidence of their technical
skill. He carries out the intention of Providence
by playing beautiful music in the sweetest possible
way. His fiddle talks to the soul of his audience,
and Edward Scharf turns the piano to the same
good account. Any sane person who has heard those
instruments tortured and thumped respectively by
Camille Urso and the furious Russian boy who
visited us last year, will feel all the better for lis-
tening to Musin and Scharf.

Carl Hertz’s new tricks and illusions are
reminiscent of old tricks and illusions performed
by the same prestidigitateur in days of yore, and
the best of them are rather too ingenious to excite
much active curiosity as to how they may have
happened. Carl Hertz got a warm reception at
Melb. Opera House last Saturday, but at the
finish of his long turn there was no burning desire
for an encore. Next Saturday the Rickards com-
pany will enlist another important recruit in
Beautiful Jessica, described as Hingland’s Queen
of the Wire. Already there is a pretty little wire
dancer hereabouts, so Beautiful Jessica will need
to be something extra special.

Revd. Charles Clark, who lectured in the
echoing Town Hall a few weeks back, is about to
make his very last appearance in Melbourne at the
Athenaeum Hall, commencing on Saturday (22nd)
with his original Dickens entertainment. The
advertisement mentions that Revd. Clark will also
repeat his two new lectures which were not easily
heard in the Town Hall. At the smaller building
they will be quite audible to everybody who gets
inside, but considering that the chances of hear-
ing the old favorite are so limited in number his
admirers had better arrive early lest they should
get left outside on the mat.

Bland Holt does roaring biz. at Brishane
Opera House. Alfred Dampier, as Starlight, has
died nightly from lead in the vitals and other com-
plications at the Royal before enthusiastic audi-
ences from wayback ; and Fitzgerald’s Circus tent
has burst in 23 places from aggravated overcrowd-
ing. Whether it is returning prosperity or the
innate desire of the Queenslander to spend his last
copper on festivity is not known, but the present
has been the most successful show season ever
known in Brisbane. In addition to the other
frivolities, one MacMahon has been running a some-
th ingrama in which a party called Jameson is
said to be represented ; and a variety co. at the
Gaiety, which includes the marvellous Smith
bikists, has gathered many shekels.
At Poverty Point,
The American rights of “ Joseph of Canaan” have been
bought by Mrs. Brown-Potter. The beauteous Bellew
would make a far more convincing Joseph than George
Rignold.
In “ Cheer Boys Cheer” Rignold makes up the part of
the Marquis of Chepstowe as Frank Madden, the jingoistic
boss Tory of Vic. Assembly, little brother of his ex-wax-
cellency bruiser Madden, and the especial white-haired
boy of the Argus. In the absence of any Australian
House of Lords, Limelight George was forced to model
his Marquis on the most Conservative person available.
Hence, no doubt, Madden.
“The Rivals,” as represented at Melb. Princess’s by
“ Gnat ” Goodwin and his compatriots, is very remindful
of Mark Twain’s “ Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.”
Goodwin’s Bob Acres is as great an anachronism, cavort-
ing amongst Sheridan’s phrases and characters, as is
Twain’s hero amongst the people and in the atmosphere
of the Arthurean legends. And the other people, with
their twang and up-to-date American oddities, are far out
of the picture, and each scene suggests a corner at a New
York masquerade. Nat Goodwin should have taken for
his motto during the seasons in these parts : “ Of Ameri-
cans, by Americans, for Australians.”
Haresfoot: “ ‘ The Rivals,’ the best of English comedies,
yet ‘ dates,’ as the saying is. The moral is that a piece as
good ought to be written up to the present day. Coppin,
a coarse and slightly vulgar actor, had more "the hang of
Acres than Goodwin, or even Jefferson. Besides, Copp.
would be supported by Lambert or Rogers, Brooke, and
Mrs. Phillips, Hans’ mother. There was a swing which
might, after all, be only an echo of the real old time, but
now there is only the shadow of a shade. Performers
have lost the grand style, so called, in its artificiality, and
are merely the Collins-street Block masquerading in 18th
century clothes, powder and patches.”
English place-names in Sheridan’s “Rivals” as pro-
nounced by Nat Goodwinites : Derby becomes Durrby
instead of Darby ; Bath becomes Bath with a short a
instead of Barth. Old comedy translated into the Yankee
language becomes quaint stuff.
There are more ways of giving an affirmative answer
than saying “ Yes.” Pretty Blanche Walsh, of the Nat
Goodwin Co., has a way of her own. It is mutely elo-
quent. Her “Yes” is a kiss-shaped pursing up of the
lips and a wrinkling of the chin combined with a sideling
of the head, very charming to observe. Miss Walsh is
one of the few actresses who act with their faces when
they are not speaking.
Melb. :“ ‘ Cheer, Boys, Cheer,’ is a failure. Rignold,
now about Irving’s age, is magnificently preserved, but
this piece might have been saved with Scot Inglis as the
hero. George must understand he cannot be beautiful for
ever. Youth has to get a show. Besides, he has not
Melb. by the wool, like Sydney.”
Miss Colbourne Baber, it is announced, hopes to achieve
abroad similar triumphs to those of her erstwhile Austra-
lian rival, Frances Saville. But Saville’s undeniable
beauty is as big a force as her fine voice.
James Cassius Williamson will be 52 on Wednesday
next, 26th Aug.
Arthur Garner writes that John Minnie Palmer Rogers
is as vivacious and truthful as ever. John Rogers as
truthful as ever ! Impossible !
“ No matinees? ” says Goodwin.
“ A Passion Flower laid on his grave.” London World
on Tristan and Isolde, by Augustus Harris’ opera co.
English musical critics agree that Wagner’s “ Tristan
and Isolde ” equals any opera ever composed. Yet it was
written in 1859, and has never been properly done in
London till this year. Time’s revenge.
New “The Rivals” is done in three acts, the American
sensible three-act “ Hamlet” may as well be tried, knock-
ing out the flummery, and playing in two hours.
The actor stabbing another to death, accidentally, in the
London Novelty Theatre, was exactly paralleled by ama-
teurs, in a Manchester theatre two years ago when
Romeo killed Tybalt.
Fitzgeralds’ Circus took £436 on opening night in Rock-
hampton (Q.). The big show lost one night only on the
whole of its Q. tour. That was caused by the lighter
which carried their traps going aground in the Fitzroy.
When it is remembered that the Brough co. were playing-
to a packed house on the same night as the above sum
was taken, it is fair to assume that good shows will pay in
the North during winter.
Kate Vaughan, the famous English dancer, said to be

The Quid Nunes of Melb. Pav<s were asking why Comique
Godfrey was so mildly starred, at the Opera House, for
the first part of his last week. The explanation was to be
found in a current rumor that Godfrey had taken St.
George’s Hall, and was going to open in opposition to his
beloved ’Arry. However, towards the end of the week,
the capitals turned once more in Godfrey’s favor, where-
fore speculators concluded again that his ardor had
slackened in re running alone. The right conclusion is
that he has made up his mind for a dive, but will proceed
fair and softly.
London Sketch in an interview with Jennie Lee : “ I

Governor of Melbourne called on me in my dressing-

A lady at London Royal Aquarium jumps from a height
of 150 feet on to solid ground for the sake of thrilling a
bloodthirsty public. Were the jump bona-fide, the re-
sult would, of course, be eternal smash for the jumper,
so she is aided by wire mechanism. The thrill of the
public therefore springs either from the thought of the
“ might have been ” or the hope of “ what may be.”
Music, which hath power to soothe the savage breast,
hath no power to soothe the savage music-teachers
of Melb., who are at each other’s throats, in press
controversies and private vilifications, and various
libel-actions are incubating. Meanwhile, Prof. Marshall
Hall declares that there are not a dozen private and
school music-teachers in Melbourne who are fairly compe-
tent to teach the five-finger exercise.
Re critic Clement Scott’s desire to visit Australia on a
lecturing-tour, overtures on the subject were made to
R. S. Smythe a year or two ago, and the Much-Travelled
declined. He considered that London D.T.’s theatrical
reporter had no money out here. Australians would
rather see plays than hear a man talk about them.
Two theatrical notices from Melb. Age. Firstly: “A
spectacular melodrama is perhaps scarcely to be judged
from a lofty literal standpoint, but ‘ Cheer, Boys, Cheer,’
in point of dialogue, is somewhat below the average. It
is, moreover, deficient in situations.” Secondly : “ ‘Cheer,
Boys, Cheer ’ at the present time runs with a vivacity and
spirit that proves it to be the great play proclaimed by
the London press on the occasion of its production.”
Death extinguished “the Vital Spark” (Jenny Hill)
early last month, and that remarkable little woman was
duly buried. Also, a chaplain said over her grave “She
was bright, social, kind, and loving. The good memory
dwells deep down in the hearts of those nearest and
dearest to her.” Rorty Jenny, whose strong point was
female coster impersonation at the ’alls, had played a
season in burlesque at the Gaiety, and run her own pub.
Three or four years back W. & M. tried to get her for their
Melb. panto.
We were at Balranald the other week, writes a poor
player to The Bulletin. Success had thawed the
managerial heart, and one night we passed in about a
dozen aboriginals, who seemed, from the boards, to
thoroughly enjoy the performance. After the show, we
found the nigs waiting for us at the stage-door : “ You
gib it thickpen’ ? ” asked one, apparently the boss.
“What for?” inquired the manager. “Whaffor? We
bin werry good. We sit an’ listen all you yabber, not
say anything. We think it deserve him thickpen’.”
Mrs. Kendal on American theatre-goers, apropos their
appreciation of the “ naughty ” bits in “ Mrs. Tanqueray ”
to the exclusion of the intended “ moral ” I go

ences come to the theatre with never a look at the sky,
but everyone looks at the spit.”
Finn : Many burlesque and song-and-dance artists
quickly weaken and, in some cases, quite lose their voices,
because, in response to an encore of a song and dance,
they reappear when breathless and tired and, instead of
repeating the dance, repeat the last verse of the chorus,
thus straining their voices. Two well-known exceptions
to this failing are Maggie Moore and Alice Leamar. When
either of these artists is encored for a song and dance
she repeats the dance only.
A curious explanation is given of the reason why Augus-
tus Harris acted for a few years after taking Drury Lane.
Every Drury Lane manager, who acts three years, has a
right to a pension of £365 a-year out of the fund.
Wary Harris, knowing the ups-and-downs, would not even
despise this, but made it safe.

The Wild-Cat Column .
The N.S.W. Land-tax Department has fairly
started now to wrestle with a stupendous difficulty. The
trouble is created by the mortgage provisions of G. 11.
Reid’s Act. Land which is not mortgaged pays Id. in the
£ per annum on its capital value. Land which is mort-
gaged pays Id. in the £ on the capital value that exists
over and above the mortgage, while the mortgagee pays
income-tax on the interest derived from the mortgage.
This works out in a lot of remarkable ways. Leaving out
the exemptions, which are a very small matter, £96,600
worth of land with no mortgage on it would be taxed £4OO
a year. On the other hand, £96,000 worth of land with a
mortgage of £48,000 on it at 5 per cent, would pay land-
tax on £48,000, equal to £2OO a year, and income-tax (6d.
in the £) on the interest (£2400) of the mortgage, equal
to £6O, making the total of land and income-tax £260.
Therefore, there is a clear gain of £l4O by fixing up a
bogus mortgage on the property. If the bogus mortgage
is for £72,000 at 5 per cent, then the total land and
income-tax will be £l9o—-a saving of £2lO, or more than
half the tax. Again, if the same property was mortgaged
in the boom-time for £96,000 at 5 per cent., and owing to
depreciation the mortgage now covers the whole value,
and it all comes under the income-tax provisions, the tax,
instead of being £4OO, will be only £l2O. Therefore, the
law offers a solid inducement to every Fat Man to put a
large bogus mortgage on his property, and he is doing it,
and the loss to the revenue is likely to be considerable.
A’so, the labor of trying to bowl out the Fat transgressor
will be heavy and expensive. That is why they are
“lending” Public Service Commissioner Coghlan to the
Land-tax office.

The financial situation in Maoriland throws
some light on Tasmanian Treasurer Fysh’s great con-
version-scheme. For some years past the M.L. Govt, has
been gradually converting its high-priced loans into long-
dated 4 or 3£ per cent, stock. As it gives the present
market-value of the old stock in new securities, the pro-
cess has added £2,038,973 to the public debt, and at the
same time it has reduced the annual interest by £159,644.
If about £35,000 a year of this amount was put away in a
sinking-fund it would accumulate, by the time the new
stock falls due, into enough to pay the two millions of
extra debt incurred through the conversion—always pro-
vided it could be put away in some place where no hungry
Treasurer could get at it; and the revenue would still be
£124,000 a year better off. But as not a single penny of
the saving has been put into a sinking-fund the debt is
permanently increased, and the fact that the interest has
been reduced by increasing the debt is only made an ex-
cuse for floating another big loan and increasing the
debt still more ; and, though the burden on the revenue
is £159,000 less, no one suggests putting that amoant into
the public works fund and dispensing with further bor-
rowed money. Treasurer Fysh’s scheme, showing how
the Australasian debts can be converted, and a huge
saving in interest effected, and part of the saving put to
a sinking-fund to pay off the increased debt, and all the
rest, is very beautiful on paper —but who is going to hold
that sinking-fund? *

The most amazing balance-sheet The Bulletin
Has come across for a long time is that of Montgomerie’s
Brewery 00. (Melbourne). For the half-year ended 30th
June the receipts were £6477, and the working expenses
£7587 ; therefore, there was a loss for the six months of
£lllO. The co. commenced the half-year with £2661 to
credit of profit and loss, and ended with a credit of £1551
only, the rest being swallowed up. And this £1551 is
actually called “net profit” in the balance-sheet.
The previous half-year Montgomerie’s Brewery made
a loss of £1661 oil its ordinary trading, and wrote-
off £2OOO for “contingent losses,” therefore it went
£3661 to the bad. And it then put down “ Net profit,
£2661,” which was about the finest piece Of bluff on
record. This concern, which is making a big loss
and shows a serious falling-off in its business
and is loaded down with a stupendous over-
draft, includes among its alleged assets “ Goodwill
£25,000” —which is evidently based on the assumption
that any capitalist would naturally pay £25,000 for the
privilege of losing at the above rate. The co.
has no reserve fund; it has seemingly not a penny of loose
cash it can call its own ; its overdraft is apparently up to
£68,667, which is a little worse than last half-year; its
profit and loss balance is down to £1551, so another year
at the present rate will begin to make a large hole in its
capital ; its liabilities to shareholders and creditors are
£214,000, and its visible assets, even at its own valuation,
are less than £190,000 (this is not reckoning the goodwill,
which is wholly invisible); it does a small business
which seems to be getting smaller; and, judging by the
“ net profit” item, it seems to be run by a most wonder-
ful set of financiers.

Hudson Bros. (Limited), which Premier Reid
quoted in his budget speech as a great example of the
alleged revival which has set in, reports that it has suc-
cessfully made a big reduction in wages, and that: “ The
amount of business transacted for the past half-year is
barely equal to that of the corresponding period of last
year, but your directors have the satisfaction of reporting
they have since secured a fair contract for rolling stock,
and that more work is offering.” Apparently, therefore,
whatever revival there is consists mostly in Government
orders to be paid for with borrowed money.

Newcastle Gas and Coke Co. has made =B2ll7 —
£32 less than last half-year. Div. and bonus at 12% per

has a profit of £13,797 for the year, and pays 5 per cent,
dividend (£4800). Castlemaine (Vic.) Woollen Co. pays
7% per cent., and Melbourne Gas Co. 8 per cent. Aus-
tralian Star (Sydney) pays 6 per cent. (£1844), and adds
£lOOO to reserve, £6OO to sinking fund, and writes off
£2589 for depreciation, &c.

The Mildura mortgagees have decided to reduce
interest to 5 per cent, (it formerly averaged 9 per cent.)
and not to call up any principal for five years. Under
these conditions Mildura should have a fair chance of
success. So should the mortgagees ; if they had demanded
the letter of their bond the only possible result would
have been the practical abandonment of the settlement,
and then the securities would have deteriorated to next to
nothing. It was a case of throwing 4 per cent, overboard
to lighten the ship and prevent the principal and the 9
per cent, sinking together.

The State auditor has come uppermost in his
trouble with the Victorian Local Government system.
For a long time the local bodies, when the State auditor
showed that the cash had been misappropriated, or that
the bloated councillor had done what he oughtn’t, simply
refused to pay audit-fees, as a warning to the Government
official not to discover unpleasant things in the future ;
and owing to a leakage in the Act it seemed doubtful if
the latter could recover. The doubt has been settled by
a Supreme Court order to Winchelsea Shire Council to
pay £3B 10s. audit-fees, and the law expenses incurred in
trying to scare off the audit-man amount to about £lOO.
* * * *
N.S.W. Supreme Court decides that the busted
municipality of Lambton needn’t pay the £7OOO it owes to
the Commercial Bank, because the aldermen, when they
borrowed it, didn’t advertise the purposes for which the
loan was intended, as required by the Act. In other
words, the aldermen aren’t, fined for breaking the law, hut
the bank is fined heavily because the aldermen broke the
law !

Someone sends along the balance-sheet of the
municipal district of Moruya (N.S.W.). It sets forth that
the Government grants and endowment for the half-year
are £ll7, and that the whole expenditure on roads and
bridges and other works is £26 13s. sd. Out of £173 ex-
pended, £lO7 goes in salaries, rent of council chambers,
election expenses, legal ex.’s, printing and frill. There
are some quaint municipalities in N.S.W. For the year
ended Feb., ’95, Marsfield spent £8 on public works and
£29 on salaries and office expenses to see that the £8 was
properly expended ; Grenfell spent £260 in salaries, &c.,
to see that £174 was properly laid out on works ; Hill End
spent £56 watching the expenditure of £67 ; and Gundagai
spent £l2l in keeping an eye on £ll2 worth of contracts.
On the other side, Ulinarragot through £1456 of contracts
with only £63 worth of supervision, and Berry spent only
£B4 in bossing £1037 worth of work. Some of the muni-
cipalities, however, seem to be only man-traps for the
State endowment.

Some Victorians are starting a new woollen mill
at Footscray (Melb.), and the capital has all been sub-
scribed locally. N.S.W. is thinking of starting a beet-
sugar industry at Tenterfield, and a gathering of prospec-
tive beet-growers cheered lustily when the local member
talked of going to England to persuade John Bull to put
up the money for building the mill. That is the difference
between the two provinces. The Victorian trusts to him-
self—most of the time, at all events. The cornstalk
hardly ever does—he can’t be found dead without the
assistance of British capital.

A Bulletin correspondent:—Negotiations have
for some time been pending between an agent of a certain
bank-official and the family of a man, since dead, con-
cerning a large sum of money said to be lying in one of
the banks in the deoeased’s name, about which the family
knows nothing, but which, as heirs to their father’s estate,
they could legally claim if they knew exactly where it
was. As it means to the clerk the loss of his billet, he
refuses to part with the information under a stiff figure.
At any rate, the clerk has as much right to levy blackmail
on the family for a portion of the money as the bank has
to rob them of the whole—which, all the same, is morally
no right at all. When is that Unclaimed Money Act
coming ?

Awhile back the estate of a certain eccentric old
Australian identity was sold outright to some smart
financiers at a price that the executors had very good
reasons to congratulate themselves upon —at the time.
So very smart indeed were the buyers known to be that
the executors were at a loss to understand how they ever
came to make much a palpable mistake in valuing the
property. The mystery, however, was cleared up long
afterwards, when the executors learned that one of the
financial syndicate had all along held a bank-deposit
receipt of the defunct eccentric’s for £l7,26o—the exact
figure at which they bought the whole estate. No record
of the deposit was found by the executors in deceased’s
books ; its existence was known only to the man who by
some means had dropped across it, and the bank that
held the money. And both the man and the bank were
interested in keeping things dark; the bank because, in
the absence of a badly-wanted Act of Parliament, it is
allowed to annex for its own use all such unclaimed
moneys, and the man because of his contemplated deal
with the executors for the estate. Consequently, the
£17,000 odd was not taken into account by the executors
when they closed with the smart financiers’ offer for “ the
sale of the whole estate, absolutely.”

the recent frost, and ruin is writ large over the farms
around Bundaberg. In Gingin district the crop has
actually rotted off large areas, the new Central Mill not
being quite ready in time to take over the cane —which
sad state of affairs was caused by the delay in obtaining a
locomotive from England for use on the tramlines. In
the Isis district a similar state of affairs prevails. Despite
clerical protests, Sunday work prevails at all the available

Alleged letter from Longmuir to Fink, dated
July, ’92, produced in the City of Melbourne Bank prose-
cution :—“ My dear Fink, —I suppose it is no use remind-
ing you that you have still not returned the documents
re General Assets Company. Their being executed cannot
affect your position in the slightest to the extent of a
penny, and it is rather galling to find that the prophecies
of all my friends have come true, and you persistently
refuse to assist me, although doing so costs you so little.
If I was stupid enough to think that you were a man of
your word, and would not go back on your many pro-
mises to do anything in your power to put me right with
the directors, yet you need not be so d d disobliging
when you lose nothing.—Yours faithfully, Colin M. Long-
muir.”
The assistant-manager of the bank swore that
he never saw or heard of this extraordinary letter before.
It is a beautiful letter so far as concerns the directors on
trial, inasmuch as in it Longmuir—the man that’s dead —
professes to tacitly admit that he and not the directors
was responsible for whatever Was wrong with Fink’s
account; therefore, he wanted Fink to put him right
with the directors. And Longmuir, being dead as afore-
mentioned, can’t deny the letter, or repudiate the respon-
sibility, or explain anything connected with it. It appears
more and more that Longmuir was the only man who
knew anything, and the fact that he is dead —if he is still
dead—can’t be too much regretted.

Anticipated that next year’s Vic. butter-season
will completely wipe out the majority of the minor butter-
factories and creameries now cumbering the country dis-
tricts. Already collapses have not been few, and the
probable low prices of next year will leave the industry in
the hands of the big co’s and monopolists. As matters
are and have been, wherever a dozen or so cookies are
gathered together, so surely will be found a butter-factory
in charge of a heaven-born expert, whose salary generally
runs into a couple of pounds weekly, and whose lack of
experience generally leads to the waste of all material
committed to his charge. Very few of these small con-
cerns do any good.

Korumburra miners are petitioning Vic. Parlia-
ment to have an import-duty of 2s. 6d. per ton put on
coal, so as to shut out the Newcastle article. The claim
of the owners of the Gippsland coal-fields to consideration
at the hands of Victorians is not great. A section is
under suspicion for compulsory sales of land to employes,
and all of them deserve blame for th'> cu-u 1
fisnness shown during the progress of the recent N.S.W.
coal-strike. Instead of seizing the opportunity to popu-
larise their coal, they raised prices to the highest limit,
and delivered it very imperfectly screened. If they had
been smart business-men, they would have put forward a
big effort to capture the Victorian trade. Gippsland coal
is, for household purposes, generally superior to N.S.W.
coal. It does not produce “ smuts ” and ‘ blacks and
pungent discoloring smoke. It is, as a rule, a good house-
hold coal, and therefore a bad gas coal. But under the
special circumstances of the case, the coalfields being
Fat-Men monopolies, a protective duty would be a source
of danger, unless the State took stringent precautions to
give the miner ai)d the public their fair share of protec-
tion from the monopolists.

A point in Vic. licensing-law : A publican
before opening a private-bar in his house must apply for
and get permission from the licensing-court. It has for
years been the legal belief that this permit applied only
to the then licensee, ceasing when he or she left the pre-
mises ; however, a smart hotel-broker, who had evidently
swallowed the Act, parchment and all, thought differently.
He advised a client that a private-bar which hadn t been
used for years could be re-opened, as the. right had never
been cancelled or withdrawn, and applied to the license
of the house, not to the licensee. She accepted the hint
in defiance of legal opinion, and was prosecuted ; but the
broker’s view was upheld. Now publicans who have been
fined for similar alleged offences, having found they have
unrevoked private-bar licenses, are besieging Govt, for a
return of the fines wrongly inflicted.

The shareholders in the B.H. South who have
accepted the published statement that the co. had some-
thing like £20,000 in hand must have felt bad when they
read the directors’ report and balance-sheet. The cash in
hand is shown to be £2O odd, while the liquid assets are
less than they were six months ago. Profit and loss
account shows that whereas £10,453 was brought forward
to this last half-year, only £8394 remains to be carried for-
ward. Outstanding liabilities are about £BOO less, but
liquid assets are also £7OO less. On January 1 there were
201 tons of concentrates on the mine, and on July 1 there
were 529 tons. Assuming that advances against ship-
ments of concentrates were as satisfactory during this
last half-year as in the preceding period, it seems, then,
that the co. has got 328 tons of concentrates to the good
and £2059 to the bad on the half-year’s operations. As
concentrates are not worth more than about £5 per ton,
it would thus appear that the co. has actually made a
small loss on the term.
For this result perhaps not one in thirty of the
shareholders was prepared—the present writer being one
of the 29. And the grounds appeared good enough. In
the last report a profit of two or three thousand was
shown, and the general manager, after saying that the
mine never looked as well as it then did, promised better
things when certain developmental works, then near com-
pletion, were finished. Since then the production of ore
has been sustained, and likewise the output of concen-
trates, whose value has also remained fairly constant.
The only explanation to be derived from a singularly in-
conclusive report and statement of accounts is that the
ore has taken more getting lately; at any rate, £17,073
has been spent in winning 29,951 tons this last half as
against £14,102 in winning 29,745 tons in the preceding
half.
Allowances possibly ought to be made for the
alleged desire of certain influential people to effect a
transfer of this mine from present shareholders —or from
some of them, at least. And somehow the name at the
foot of the directors’ report does not just now inspire con-
fidence. In these circs, it is a great pity that the com-
munication to the shareholders and the public was not
made particularly ample. As it stands, and placing upon
it the only construction which seems possible, few of
greater importance have been issued by any B.H. co. The
South’s ore bodies are confessedly poor in silver, but they
are rich in lead, large and uniform above the average.
No large profits could be expected ; but on the basis of
the returns for the last half-year of ’95, when, as before
said, a small profit was made, it was expected that with
improved working appliances and the steady advance in
metal-saving by concentration larger profits would accrue
in the future. *No better work in any direction is, how-
ever, set out here ; and the work for the latter half of
1895 was not as good as it was in the first half. Consider-
ing the additions to the plant, &c., the results have there-
fore grown steadily worse. The manager says he has now
1100 tons of concentrates in the crude slimes ; and these
are to be operated. Further, the rock-breaking capacity
is to be increased, this having become necessary in conse-
quence of the increased hardness of the ore at the lower
levels. So far, at the best, more than half of the silver
has “ remained unrecovered ” (managements object to the
term “ lost,” and perhaps rightly); and this and the con-
stant additions and amendments made to the concentrat-
ing plants prove that, after all, sulphide-treatment, as
practised so far, is little if anything beyond experiment.
And it isn’t particularly comforting to reflect that these
experiments are consuming very considerable quantities
of what at present are reckoned the best ores to operate.

E. A. Ashcroft, of the Sulphide Corporation
(Ashcroft’s process) Ltd. : “The co. had purchased 360
acres of land at Cockle Creek, near Newcastle, and the
works were now being erected there at a cost of £250,000.
. . . When in operation these works would find employ-
ment for about 5000 men. . . . They had enough ore in
the Central, which they had also purchased, to keep the
works going for at least twenty years.” Ashcroft is in
Broken Hill, supervising the erection of concentrating
plant on the Central. But it isn’t on a scale to keep 5000
men going.

The Broken Hill fire is slowly burning itself
out. To keep it down last half-year cost £3OOO ; to put it
completely out is now regarded as impossible. Fires in
very big mines will not be put out.

It is significant that the draining of the Junc-
tion mine’s deep western level has drained also the North.
This seems to prove quite conclusively that the North
already has the Junction lode. In which case the Junc-
tion North gets it only in a corner, though the underlay
is into it all the way. But it’s bad for the Junction Con-
solidated and Silver Hill, and all that recently much-
boomed run of little shows. And, besides, it strengthens
the case for a contention, not always popular, put forward
in many Bulletin pars, concerning the course and charac-
ter of the B.H. lode at the north end.

Editor Bulletin, —Cobarites are not “ chagrined
and amazed that the phenomenal richness of the Peak
has not given them another boom.” Rather the opposite.
They are satisfied to let the world keep its ignorance of
the rich blue and brown lode while they rake in the spoil.
They have nothing to sell, and certainly “ their energies
are devoted to the mines nearer home.” They want the
ground for themselves, and that very desire, 1 think,
proves the value of their mines as compared with any
which are being stocked and exploited by the boomtide
press.—D. C. Green, Cobar.

The opal-miners at White Cliffs (N.S.W,), out-
side the recently-floated English co., propose to send to
Europe their own agent, in the hope that thus they may
dodge the middleman, whom they suspect, with much
reason, of having mercilessly fleeced them hitherto. Several
hundreds have been subscribed, with the object of sending
over a pushing man. All attempts to get rid of small
individual parcels have up to date utterly failed ; and on
the field (which Father Curran is just now visiting), buyers
are offering prices so ridiculously low as to set at defiance
the current statement that opal is in good demand again.

Honesty is not the West policy.
Deeble, the owner of the Bendigo United
Pyrites works, is about to establish branch works at
Wyalong. The completion of the Climo chlorination
works on that camp has been long delayed by legal com-
plications among the owners.
According to Minister Foster, the new Vic.
Mines Bill will include provisions for ventilation. Foster
thinks that when “ holing through ” is practicable it is
the best plan, and quotes for an example the New Chum
and Shenandoah in Bendigo, each at present with its
separate winze. The abolition of royalty, he declares, is
only delayed by the fact that certain agreements per-
petuated by the Act of ’B5 are still in force; but, when
they expire, he says that the Assembly “will take precious
good care that payment of royalty to private individuals
never creeps into the law again.” Tribute, he admits, is
perplexing, but he finds two cardinal principles in security
of tenure and the substitution of “ net” for “gross in
the percentage of the proceeds given to the working
miner. That word “ net,” he says, would lighten a lot of
hardship for the tributor.

other metropolitan spots, are auriferous.

Dear Bulletin,— Apropos the many tales of
weary marches through hot and dusty regions in the West.
I have just received a letter from my brother, who has
finished a ten-davs’ tramp from Deptford, Gippsland(Vic.),
to Batlow (N.S.W.), covering 210 miles through snow not
less than 9in. and in some parts 3ft. 6in. deep. Refreshing
reading for parched Australians. —W.M.
“ A start is to be made to open out on Bickford’s
lode in the Croesus mine (W.A.) at a depth of 20ft. It is
expected the lode will be richer than on the surface.”
Very deep sinking. It would be a striking novelty to
hear for once that some lode or other was expected to be
poorer with depth. That is the fact with nine out of ten
lodes all over the world, nevertheless.
* * * *
The special commissioner of the Age and Sydney
D.T., writing on Westralian mines, avers that one alleged
yield of 400 oz. a week was kept up for months by the use
of purchased gold till the mine was taken over by Bull
and Co. for £250,000, when the returns dropped—to
lOdwt. They bought bullion, and J. Bullion bought the
mine. The commissioner himself, at Kalgoorlie, was
offered 100 guineas, and another £lOO if the mine floated,
“for a favorable report.” The confidence-trick. For
match-box, read mine.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —The writer of those Age and
Sydney D.T. articles on W.A. makes a few mistakes, and
I hasten to correct him. Burbank’s isn’t a cement show,
and, furthermore, a circle of 12 miles doesn’t represent
all the W.A. fields. Most of the men who write of W.A.
only see Bayley’s and the Derry and the Loch, and then
size up an enormous area of country on the sampling of
half-a-pound of dirt. One duffer doesn’t damn a field,
any more than one Boulder proves that all mines are
Boulders. The Age writer compares W.A., quite a
newly-opened country, with Vic. Well, then. How
much capital has been slung away on frauds in Vic. since
1854? How does W.A. compare with N.S.W., which is
the biggest duffer gold-mining country on record ? The
matter written weekly by one Sydney mining-expert—may
God give him modesty ! —is immeasurably worse than the
bulk of W.A. scribes’ reports in its vast promises which
are never fulfilled, and its statements that some rotten
N.S.W. mine “will start crushing shortly.” Westralian
mining is solid, and W.A. will be a field when London is
in ashes. If the Western mining reports are more fraudu-
lent generally than truthful, it follows that for three
years over 50,000 people have been engaged in a con-
spiracy to play the confidence-trick with the whole world,
And that is an impossibility.—Randolph Bedford.

Mt. Malcolm—a Sydney-run and Sunday-tipped
W.A. show —manager’s report:—“ Driven 30ft. s.e. of the

the mine were abandoned.

Norseman Miner calmly computes that nearly
£6,000,000 worth of gold is in sight on the Norseman

The Coolgardie death-roll is a long one. Reuben
Ricard, who died in the country, was one of the most
competent, best-known, and best-loved of American
mining men, and it is a pity he “went over” before the
world was told what he thought of the country. Captain
Vaudery, recently found dead in his tent, was a well-
known Ballarat manager, who opened several copper-
mines in N.S.W. He did well in the West, having the
luck to be conveniently near when Coolgardie got a new
life in the transformation of the Great Boulder. He re-
presented English money, and made it for his employers
as well as himself. In the death of Fitzgerald Moore
Australia has lost perhaps its boss boomer, and that is
saying a great deal. Moore was generally the first in a
boom and the first to leave it. He once boomed Cobar and
scooted ; he also boomed poor little Tasmania almost to
the verge of the madhouse. Amidst all his talk—and he
could talk!—he was remembered more on account of a
certain historical nod than anything else.
* * * •
One W.A. newspaper—the Menzies Miner —
thinks the time has arrived to admit that a great number
of the mines floated are wild-cats, and to warn the public
that many of the men who profit most by the boom are
adventurers. It has determined to expose some of the
brazen schemes of plunder, but admits the “ task is
perilous, unpleasant—perhaps unprecedented. It would
be easier and no doubt temporarily more profitable for the
Miner to preserve a discreet silence, but, desirous of the
permanent prosperity of the community, the Miner
accepts the risk which attaches to duty.”

The prospectus of the Mount Lyell Golden Flux
Supply Co. appeals for a modest £3OOO (in 30,000 shares of
two “ bob” each), of which £2400 will represent working
capital, the vendors settling all flotation exes, out of the
remaining £6OO. Another 30,000 shares—a half-share in
the spec.—will go as payment for the property, and, inas-
much as the Mount Lyell mine can do with heaps of flux,
and the-property aforesaid is conveniently situated for
supplying that want, the Supply co. should float—if the
Mt. Lvell Co. can’t make better arrangements. The
prospectus calls attention to the success of the Tarra-
wingee Flux Co., which has paid 37 divs. up to date.

Probable candidates for the Mt. Lyell board at
the Nov. election—first since the Melb. co. was organised
four years ago : James Crotty, an original owner, as
shrewd a mining-man as they make ’em, and who twice
saved the mine from wreck when the Tas. co. was mis-
managing it; one of the four heaviest Lyell stock-
holders. David Stratton, a well-gilt Co'otamundra
miller with a big swag of scrip. He is anxious to wipe off
Mr. Knox—the director alleged to be at the bottom of the
debenture-issue. If either of aforesaid scrippers get on
the board it will paralyse a very happy but somewhat
mysterious family.

At a Sydney missionary meeting, the other
night, to farewell a young Sydney lady who had
“set herself apart for the Master’s work in Han-
kow, China,” Rev. Dr. Lawes said “ he was sorry
they hadn’t been able to avail themselves of the
services of willing sisters in New Guinea. He
was anxious to have them, though, of course, the
climate and the moral condition of the people
placed a great responsibility upon those taking
lady missionaries there.” Which is distinctly
funny, considering all we know about the moral
condition of Messrs. Hung Fat and Kow Tow, in
whom Australian women seem to be taking such a
lot of interest. “After the dedicatory prayer”
the young lady remarked that “she was going
forward because the Master had said ‘Go,’ and
QUESTIONABLE DIET.
FIRST DOMAINER: “ Wot d’yer think the parson advised me to do? W’y, to fill meself with the
’Oly Spirit!”
she was simply obeying. She loved the Chinese
because the Master loved them. (Applause).”
Judging from the fuss women make over the
bland and obsequious Chow, the latter is re-
garded in Australian missionary circles as God’s
Chosen. The pietistic cant talked about the
sensual Chow is absolutely sickening to the average
white man. It is increasingly plain that the
moving spirit in this woman-missionary business
is Adventure and not mere benevolence—else why
don’t all these exalted young people go and soothe
the dying hours of the miserable white wretches
in the Liverpool Asylum cancer-ward and such
places? Any woman of truly nun-like soul who
wants a field for her charity can find it at Liver-
pool Asylum, or in the Parramatta homes, where
there are hundreds of slowly-dying old people who
can’t rise out of bed.

The banquet given by Lee Yan at Cairns
(Q.) to celebrate the birth of his son, the first
locally-born full-caste Chinese baby, was attended
by 400 guests, including many whites. The baby
“was first presented by his mother to Mr. Mae-
alister, our worthy Police Magistrate, who handled
it with evident care and delight, and finally be-
stowed a sort of ‘ bless you, my boy ’ kiss On the
infant’s innocent little face. Mr. Forbes followed
suit, and each of the guests did likewise.” (Cairns
is the only place in Australia where it is en regie
for whites to kiss Chinese babies and take off
their hats to the infants’ fathers.) Champagne
flowed freely, and, as a special mark of favor,
the only press representative present was unosten-
tatiously handed a jug of draught beer. The
first dish served at the banquet was stewed shark
fins, and the next baked dog, served with boiled
bamboo sprouts and white sauce. Two helpings
bore testimony to the fact that the P.M. enjoyed
this course immensely, and he embraced the
opportunity presented by the waits between the
helps to point out tb his fellow guests that the
Chinese as a nation were decidedly far in advance
of the rest of the world in matters of cookery.
Priam, a splendid St. Bernard dog, the property
of Mr. Hollis, at this stage of the festivity left the
room. Bird’s-nest soup, a most appetising delicacy,
was next brought forward ; then followed rat a la,
Russe, which was found to fully bear out the “affee
same chicken ” recommendation of the host.
Stewed duck and bacon, fat pork stewed with
giblets, Chinese preserved chickens (eggs hatched
for 19 days and then pickled), beche-de-iner soup,
preserved shrimps served in castor oil, sun-dried
oysters boiled in vinegar, fried catfish, seagull pie,
jelly-fish pudding, and innumerable other dainties
followed in rapid succession. Then came dessert
and the speeches, in which the P.M. was described
as “Welly good man.” The “good-luck” cash-
offerings made to the saddle-colored infant totalled
£250.

Latest Sydney case of leprosy (unreported).
Some time ago a lady living in the suburbs, when
in town, bought a bag of bananas—presumably the
popular “fourteen for sixpence ”-—at “a foreigner’s”
shop. When she got home, portion of a human
hand vvas found amongst the fruit. The police
have since removed the owner to the lazarette.
Hands and bananas ! Ugh !
The English, Irish, Scotch, and Australian
corps are, it is rumored, to be shortly reinforced
by a natural! sed-Chinese corps. And all the time
the poor Australian blackfellow, who is the one
man specially justified in repelling invaders, is left
without a captain, a rifle, or a pontifical blessing.

The Chinese in Tasmania are almost
entirely confined to the East, where the tin-
mining has gradually dropped into their hands.
Of the 1000 Mongolians tolerated in Tasmania,
many are wealthy bosses employing white men,
and even the common or garden-variety of China-
man is far more patron kingly arrogant than any
native white. Apart from the West Coasteis,
Tasmanians would sooner think of objecting to
Bishop Montgomery than to Chinamen.

It is recorded that the wife of a certain
Australian Governor, much boomed for his
generosity, officiated at the opening of some
charitable institution, the other day, and after the
ceremony had concluded H.E. turned to the ex-
pectant secretary, and producing a fiver from her
dainty purse, said: “Take a guinea from that,
Mr. Blank. And have you sovereigns for change ?
For I have to call at three other hospitals this
afternoon.” The Governor himself is contracting
the pleasing habit of telling everybody promiscu-
ously to “ put him down ” for various amounts,
which have, so far, failed to be forthcoming not-
withstanding repeated applications.

Queensland has its weekly leper, N.S.W.
its weekly Ereetrade triumph, and Victoria its
weekly committal to gaol of some senile pauper.
The latest comes from Castlemaine, where Rev.
Hume Robertson objected to the “ sentiment ”
talked on the subject, and said that “gaol was a
very comfortable place.” Queer teaching for a
minister of the gawspel. “ I was a stranger, and
• —ye brought me before the Bench.”
By the way, a brilliant idea has struck the
Castlemaine bench aforesaid. If a man is charged
with being too poor to live they remand him for
three months. Thus he is disposed of in gaol, and
“no stigma is attached.” E. D. Williams, M.L.A.,
claims to be the father of this remarkably ingen-
ious solution.

Gov. Gorman ston is not very popular with
the Hobart “gods.” When he arrived at the
opening performance of “Trilby ” the band played
“God Save,” and the “loyal” subjects arose as
usual. The gallery, however, vented its opinion
in loud unanimous groans and hoots. It has not
forgiven H.E. for refusing to contribute towards
the funds of the local regatta, which a large
section of Slow-bart people look upon as their one
annual festival. Of this event the Governor has
always been patron since the days of Sir John
Franklin, but on last occasion the committee, on
account of H.E.’s refusal to subscribe, did not
invite him to attend. It must, however, be set
down in Lord Gormanston’s favor that in accept-
ing his present appointment, at an unprece-
dentedly small salary, he distinctly bargained that
he should not be expected to “part.”

greatness was built on beer ; the family pile was
made out of coarse, common swipes ; the reason
why Buxton is a Governor and a baronet and

Revised definitions re exemptions from
“ habitual drunkenness,” by Williams, J. (Vic.):
“ The man who is sober five days in the week, and
drinks his wages on Saturdays and Sundays, is no
a habitual drunkard.” That is to say, the man
who keeps sober in order to earn wages so that
lie can get drunk till turn-to time again, is only an
intermittent drunkard. Let him get fair justice,
please. He is only an intermittent teetotaller.
He can’t help his inability to keep habitually
drunk. Corollary : Intermittent teetotallers are
the bone and sinew and mainstay of the country.
Can’t see the corollary, can’t you ? Well, it’s

The other day three people met on a Syd-
ney harbor ferry-boat. Two of them were a
handsome and elegantly-attired young couple who
had with them a yellow-leather handbag; the
other, a man who had no one to love him but a
large, fierce dog, also bore a yellow handbag—in it
he was carrying home to Lion aforesaid a not-
over-fresh calf’s heart which he had that day ac-
quired at the butcher’s for twopence. Also, having
taken a whisky or two he did not notice the slight
change of weight when, on leaving the boat, he
by mistake picked up the young couple’s bag and
carried it off instead of his own. On reaching
home he was duly welcomed by his expectant
hound, and on opening the bag to bring forth
Lion’s meal he found instead of ti.e calf’s heart—
a perfumed silk nightdress, a suit of silk-corded
pyjamas, and three pairs of delicate canary-colored
gloves. And that bright young pair to whom the
world was a poem—well, when they opened their
bag they of course found in it the smellful heart
of a young bullock that had gone before. Talk

By the way, a prominent “religious” organ,

Maoriland Department of Labor has or-
dered that all women and girls employed in fac-
tories must either wear their hair cut short or have
it closely fastened up. This is the result of a
recent accident in a Christchurch boot-factory. A
young girl was working near a moving machine
when her loose hair caught in the belting and she
was hoisted aloft. Then her scalp came right off,
and she dropped. The description of how she
looked afterwards isn’t a nice thing to read.

That whoso liked his pint of beer,
And loved his pipe o’ baccy well,
Was booked, by broad-gauge line, to H 1!
But now (O tempora, O mores !)
We don’t believe such silly stories,
And this new parson’s smoking whim
Shows that ive have converted him !

And haste to smoke the parson’s shag,
And hear him preach, ’mid cheers and laughter,

My heart’s a-whirl —a handsome girl
As Juno large and ox-eyed!
Her eyes are bright; her teeth are white ;
Her hair’s a plain peroxide ;
Still, spite of that, she is my star,
My Girl Behind the Bar !
When I’ve no “ chinks,” she’ll stand me drinks,
And quite forget to “ slate ” ’em;
If Boss in ire for those enquire,
She’ll say demurely, lovely liar,
“ The rats, sir, must have ate ’em !”
With Boniface she loves to spar,

All poets good will say I should
Straight wed this buxom beauty,

Such is my bounden duty ;
But I’ve a wife who’s still in life —
From cemeteries far —
So, being wise, won’t bigamise

perilously near to bringing his profession into disrepute

Sydney, August 19, 1896.
Mv Dear Moorabinda—
Sydney Govt. House revelled in a dinner-party
and at-home last Thursday, when the guests were
not quite so suggestive of a crowd at a pupils’ in-
vitation concert as on a former occasion. Some-
how, whenever I hear of V.R. festivities I always
think of the Sydney woman v at a V.R. shivoo
whom somebody stupidly asked “ if she was enjoy-
ing herself ? ” With a look of withering scorn at
her green interlocutor she severely replied : “One
does not come to Govt. House to enjoy oneself,
Mrs. Blank! ”
Music occasionally amuses herself with violent
contrasts. On boy-pianist Mark Hambourg’s
heels comes four-score De Kontski, whose matinee
at Sydney Town Hall last Wednesday was flatter-
ingly attended by the usual matinee women, who
seem to be at last learning to applaud, and if they
don’t always do so at the right moment—well,
nobody, not even a woman, can do all things at
once. At the same time it hardly flattered the
composer when he played his delightful arrange-
ment of Gounod’s “ Faust ” and paused an instant
after a dewy fantasia on “ Let Me Gaze ” to have
the audience come howling down on him as if it
was the finish. It was such a disconcerting proof
to the artist of how unfamiliar he was as a com-
poser in Australia. The Chevalier,, with his
skull-cap and eerie white hair, only wants a
gaberdine and the devil coming down the chimney
to be the copy of old Faust in the opera.
His playing is full of moods, and his reading
of the Moonlight Sonata was a passionate revela-
tion after Halle’s cold and analytical performance.
I was amused, at the De Kontski matinee, by the
shoals of school-girls escorted thither to get tips
how to play the old masters. It looks well—rows
of green piano-bangers, with stereotyped back-hair
combed smooth like a pet mare’s tail, struggling
desperately to look as if they were appreciating a
sonata, though their personal studies haven’t pro-
bably got far beyond “ The Merry Peasant.”
De Kontski is indeed a marvellous old man at
80 years. He (who studied under Beethoven before
the first Napoleon died !) plays with the manual
dexterity of a boy and arranges professional trips
through Siberia—and talks of what he will do when,
he comes back to Australia later on. On being
introduced to the most utter stranger he rises,
bows profoundly, and wrings his new acquaint-
ance’s hand with the energy of adolescence. And
he is never without a strong cigar in his mouth, at
which he puffs locomotive fashion. “To puff like
that at a cigar of that sort,” said a doctor, the
other day, “ would in nine young men out of ten
produce heart-failure in 20 minutes.”
Mrs. Gilbert Wilson was the only other artist
at the De Kontski concerts. Her voice is pure,
sweet and sympathetic. I liked it—but that
doesn t bind me to approve of the matinee hat she
wore -white and black feathers, like the trim-
mings on a spinster’s hearse. By the way, I must
confess that Beethoven’s only living pupil doesn’t
give his old preceptor much room on the pro-
gramme. Two numbers of L. Von B. were equally
balanced by two of De Kontski and one piece of
Chopin and Mendelssohn !
A misprint occurred in the programme of Satur-
day’s numerously-attended De Kontski concert at
the Town Hall. The Chevalier was put down to'
play an Andante from the fifth symphony, appar-
ently composed by himself. He played, however,
the “ Andante con moto ” from Beethoven’s fifth
symphony—but one of the musical critics says De
Kontski played a melodious Andante from his own
symphony !
A well-known meteorologist carries with him
his bad luck at running the weather even when he
travels incog, on a holiday. He was staying not
long ago in a place where he was personally un-
known, and undertook the weather for the other
boarders—two youths. “ Take your coats to-day,”
he said, “and your umbrellas. It will be cold
and rainy. ” The youths returned late that even-
ing caked in dust and perspiration. “No occasion
for wraps to-day,” was his next ukase, and there
is something so beguiling in another person’s
belief that the once-bitten youths started out
coatless —and got back with something like frost.
bite and influenza. But as the weather-maker
proceeded to advise straw fans and cigarettes as
the proper guise for the next day, one of the
youths struck. “ Look here,” he said, calmly,
“ it’s kind of you to take the trouble, but really
your weather-tips are so consistently wrong that
you might be the Govt, astronomer himself ! ”
At the Sydney Town-hall grand charity concert,
the other afternoon, the most memorable item was
the appearance of Herr Staedtgen, the new Ger-
man baritone, who warbles hotly and fiercely in
the subtle language of the German sausage, and
reaches your hardened emotions by the honesty of
his sentiment and his unselfish determination to
squeeze every possible effect out of each of his
numbers. If the Herr didn’t walk on and off as
stiffly as Lauri’s automaton Hamlet, and accentu-
ate the similarity by wearing a pair of large white
gloves (the worst form at present on the English
concert-stage), he would be an unmixed blessing
to Sydney concert-programmes. Miss Rochester
also made her debut. She has a music-hall way of
jerking the melody at you, and she needs a lot of
sandpapering ; but her mezzo-soprano is very big
and assertive, and is the sort of bold, dashing
voice that one generally finds successfully asso-
ciated with pale pink tights and a scientific wink.
The other debutante, Miss Loveday, evidently
hadn’t quite made up her mind whether she was a
basso-profundo or a falsetto, and gave the audience
a taste of each in her badly-phrased rendering of
“Alas, those Chimes.”
One thing you cannot cavil at in pretty Mrs.
Brown-Potter’s reappearance at Sydney Lyceum—
you cannot say she makes the same fetish of her
wardrobe as heretofore, nor does she star Worth
(of Paris) on her programmes any more. Perhaps
the reason of this is that Mrs. B. P. plays “ La
Tosca ” in the same garments as of yore, so far as
cut and color go, so further comment on who
made ’em would be superfluous. It’s an eloquent
comment on how rakish and eccentric everyday
modes have become that La Tosca’s Grecian
draperies do not look half so impossibly pretty as
they used to. Even her first big hat with the
blossoms hung round the edge of the brim (as I
have seen fishermen hang bits of bait), and a thing
like a lyrebird’s tail stioking out of the top, was
merely a replica of what we shut our eyes to as we
pass it on the Block every day.
Mrs. Potter’s chiefest frock in “ Tosca ” is black
jetted net with a heavy foot border of gold bullion,
pink puff sleeves well off the shoulder, the whole
thing finished off with a rope of pink roses (as if
the lady had tried to hang herself with a floral
cord which had broken at the critical moment) and
ropes of pearls, the richest touch being a curling
black feather arising at the back of the head
like the thing the Mikado wears in the operetta.
Pretty Ida Hamilton (Mrs. B. P. will never get a
more physically-similar understudy) played the
Princess in a pair of dimpled white shoulders
principally, though I believe there was something
of a lilac train and a frock the color of gooseberry-
fool —however, few got beyond the shoulders. In
the 3rd act, Mrs. Potter wore the same artistic
Srey woollen in which she looks so ingenuous—
er cloak of spring green woollen at first
suggesting a component part of the gown.
The “La Tosca” people are all well
frocked in Act 2, and the color scheme
is good, and the only people who hurt me were a
superess in a flowing red robe, as if she was in
training as a cardinal; and the Queen. But the
latter can’t grumble—Queens are always scare-
crows in stageland. I never yet saw majesty
behind the floats but it suggested that somebody
Fad dressed it up in velvet-pile tablecloths.
Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society make more
noise at Sydney Town Hall next Wednesday
(26th), in the usual “ grand concert,” with Signor
Hazon in the birdcage, and his well-drilled forces
around him. By the way, it is significant of the
soaring ambition of the S.A.O.S. that their con-
certs are always “grand.” Some day, for a
novelty, they ought to advertise “ a small, mean
concert,” just to show a meek and lowly spirit.
The Sydney University Dramatic Society—another
clever band of amateurs—put up a comedy, “The
Heir at Law,’ at their stock theatre —Sydney
Gaiety—last Monday evening. I was sorry to
miss seeing the piece. One can considerably en-
large one’s acquaintance with the little efforts of
rococo dramatists by carefully keeping a finger on
the S.A.D.S., who are never guilty of staging com-
monplaces.
Good news for the Sydney frockists ! The social
column of a daily newspaper informs us that at a
recent Sydney wedding the bride’s gorgeous white
satin and brocade was made in Shanghai by a
Chinese tailor! Ah Sin, I suppose, perpetrated
this masterpiece from patterns provided—but it
just occurs to me that “John,” as a ladies’ tailor,
“ makee bodicee fitee likee waxee,” would have a
far more thrilling profession, from John’s own
point of view, than that of picking slugs off cauli-
flowers.
Apropos weddings—the announcement of a
Maoriland marriage read as follows in a Dunedin
t(M.L.) newspaper:
MARRIAGE.
Jeffery — Kerns. —On the 2nd. inst., at St. Joseph’s
Cathedral, Dunedin, by the Very Rev. P. Lynch, G.
C. Jeffery to Anna Kerns. R.I.P.
There is one large and prosperous Sydney hard-
ware-mercbant-CMm-dashing-militaire who appar-
ently means to break Methuselah’s record for
longevity. At a recent shivoo in connection with
the firm the tin-poc warrior rose and remarked
that he was happy to see many elders there that
night who came to the firm from school, and he
hoped to see their children and their children’s
children among the army of employees in the
future. “ He hoped to see ” is heroic. It only
shows, though, how little danger a N.S.W. mili-
tary character anticipates from the pursuit of his
gory pastime when he blandly talks about out-
living two generations of peaceful citizens who are
exposed to no more dreadful danger than that of
falling over something in the hardware depart-
ment.
Speaking of the fierce ironmonger who seeks the
bubble reputation, &c., I notice that Colonel
Lassetter got off a huge advertisement at a
recent R.C. meeting at Sydney Town Hall
—though I am sure he didn’t mean any-
thing like that. “ Speaking as a business
man ” (not as a soldier, you observe), “ I have
never had to discharge a member of the R.C.
Church for dishonesty or neglect of duty,” said
this truly sagacious person. Well, what did he
discharge him for? Perhaps he didn t discharge
him at all, for the gallant Colonel appears not to
have specifically stated that he had any R.C.’s
in his employ. Had he not been enthusiastic
and off his guard, he certainly would have con-
cluded by stating that he was now selling brass
bedsteads at 10 per cent, less than any other house
in the city, or have handed down a heap of price-
lists to be circulated in the meeting—for, after
that lovely advt., the Church is bound to rush the
firm for its ironmongery, and there is nothing like
striking the Holy Roman while he is hot.
What sermons might not be preached from the
“society ’’-paper formula, “Miss Smith looked
nice, as usual,” and from the frantic endeavors of
Miss Smith aforesaid to look nice ! A Mrs.
Rheese, of Sydney, had been swimming in the
sun, which afflicted her with some freckles on the
arms and shoulders, and as Mrs. Rheese “ wanted
to go to the theatre that week ” she contracted
with a Sydney toilet co. for the removal of said
freckles, which were “ very few and very small,”
for a fee of three guineas. “Madame P. Davis,”
of the toilet co., who knew “ nothing of drugs, but
had had some lessons in face-massage from a lady
in Victoria,” thereupon proceeded to make Mrs.
Rheese’s shoulders beautiful by means of a per-
chloride of mercury (corrosive-sublimate) lotion
which brought her to death’s door. Mrs. Rheese,
plucked from the tomb by a doctor, sued for £3OO
damages and got £3l. Better co bear your freckles
than chance shedding your skin and teeth.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ The girls of the Nat Goodwin Co. are voted
socially a success. Most of them are ‘ real cute ’in
private life, gifted with that power of ‘ back-talk ’
which the benighted Sydney Ducks (all Austra-
lians are ‘ Sydney Ducks ’ to Yankees) have been
taught to expect from fair Columbians, but have
hitherto looked for in vain. They have some new
slang. Johnnies they call ‘ Willieboys ’; ‘ I don’t
start’ means ‘l’m not on.’ What a Melb. girl
gushes over as too sweet for words, the Melican
gal proclaims ‘out of sight.’
“ The Shade of W. Saurin Lyster of yore seemed
to hover over the Russell-st. Hall on Tuesday
night, when all the opera-singers who have ever
come to Melb. and stayed there arose from their
silence and anticipated the past. It was a Dante
evening and so the company all played at being in
Malebolge. Wasn’t that the place where they
were all stuck head-down wards in ice? Things
were cold and frozen as though the ice-cream trade
had eaten into our very vitals. And when Gov.
Brassey and suite and assorted guests were led
forth to refreshments into an adjoining room, the
vice-regal name only seemed to suggest the spoons
which flavor the penny ice of commerce. There
was a funny printer’s error on the programme;
the last item was ‘ Prose in Egitto ; ’ after a ‘ dis-
corso ’ in Italian from Consul Corte, and a
‘ discorso’ in English from Jas. Smith, and a ‘few
remarks ’ from the Gov., the word fitted in well.
An Italian Royalty recently here fathered the
‘ Societa ’; local ‘ Sassiety ’ immediately took
to patronising Dante, rather a grim old personage
to be the presiding genius of a fashionable muffin-
worry, by the way ; they were all there. But one
familiar face was missing. Where, oh where, was
Ugo Catani ?
“The getters-up of charity performances in
Melb. are beginning to inquire : does it pay to ask
for the presence of Lord and Lady Brassey. It
means a guinea bouquet always for the lady, and
the free allotment of several of the best seats, on
the chance of the public coming to view the
honored guests. Lately the public haven’t turned
out in paying proportions. Lord Hopetoun didn’t
like concerts, but when he gave his patronage he
always sent a cheque. Lord Brassey gives his
presence without the cheque.
“ Lady Brassey and the Guv’mentouse party
were cycling around Caulfield the other Saturday,
and on their return journey had the ill-luck to
strike a van-load 'bf junior football barrackers as
they turned into Chapel-street, Prahran. The
opportunity was right into the hands of the
assembled larrikins, and after the humorists of the
party had exhausted their stock of Rabelaisian
wit, the whole thirty or so started with a wild
whoop ‘ Since Mary Ann has learned to ride a
bicycle,’ bawling the classic ditty for a couple of
miles. The perspiring cyclists endeavored to pass
and leave the van, but the driver was as tricky as
scorcher Martin, and carried too many tactics to
permit of such a move. Ultimately the whole
party decided to turn from the smooth tram-track
to a newly-metalled side-street, which they did
with the words of the ‘Mary Ann Cycle’ song
echoing in their flaming ears.
“For the first time on record, the Mayor of
Melb. has been left out of the invitation-list to
the Governor’s ball, and great is the indignation
of the ultra-loyal circle of Melb. City Council.
“ The allegation of smuggling directed by De-
tective Christie at certain ‘ swagger ’ naval officers
is regarded as a horrid shame in Toorak circles,
which have grown more solidly Freetrade than
ever since the charges were made. If these be
upheld, some light may be cast on the mystery of
how the haw tv youths manage to maintain such
style on the £1 15s. a week and keep at which a
paternal Government assesses their worth.
“ A recent fashionable engagement is that of
Miss Hilda Cumming, of Toorak, at present in
England with her sister, Mrs. Rupert Clarke.
Mr. Ritchie, the bridegroom-elect, is the son of a
medico, and was formerly a familiar figure in
Melb. society.
“ America must look to her laurels now that
Australia enters the lists as a purveyer of pro-
fessional beauties. A very handsome matron
went ’Ome not so very long ago with the avowed
intention of ‘catching the Prince of Wales’eye.’
Letters from the Big Smoke testify that the am-
bitious lady’s house and carriage are worthy of
her charms, and that her opera-box is next but
one to Tummy’s own. At such short range, the
bejewelled brunette beauty should certainly score
a bull’s-eye straight away.
“ Melbourne society pets lady doctors, and at a
recent big at-home there were five of them on
show as the lions of the occasion, lined up in a row
beside the hostess. On the other hand, from
grudging male coadjutors the poor girls get more
kicks than ha’pence. In the dining-hall of a cer-
tain medical institute, for instance, the he-sur-
geons, ’tis said, refused to carve for their fair
colleagues, who, in consequence, must advance
upon the joint and operate ‘on their own * or go
dinnerless.
“Governor Brassey still shudders when he hears
of the big florists’ bills paid by the Hopetouns.
For his part he holds that home-grown blossoms
should suffice for ordinary occasions, and he may
often be seen at an unpretentious establishment
choosing the household fruit. Of course he has
an expensive progeny; so much is expected of a
gilded patriarch. The other day, when pretty
Mrs. Freeman-Thomas came of age, she got
£BO,OOO in money and diamonds, her share pro.
tern, of the family spoil. She is the youngest of
the first Lady Brassey’s children, but there’s
another family to be provided for now.”
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.
SPORTING NOTIONS .
Apropos the row between the professionals and
the Surrey committee, let The Bulletin put it from the
pros.’ standpoint. Richardson, the great bowler of his
kind in England, being a pro. receives £lO (per match,
not per day) as his salary for big matches, and £5 for
county matches. An alleged amateur like Grace receives,
say, £2O for “expenses.” Further, the pro. is treated as
a pro. : has to dress in a separate room, dine at a separate
table, and in other ways be reminded of his servility,
whilst Grace and the other alleged amateurs who live
on the game are “ esquired” and placed alongside royalty
at dinner. In theory Grace is a doctor practising his
profession ; in reality he is as much a pro. as Richardson,
seeing that he plays for every county engagement for
Gloucester and is always available for big matches. Rich-
ardson and his brother pros., in going on strike, once
more draw attention to the utter hypocrisy of the English
amateur and professional system.
* « * •
Sympathisers with the professional “strikers,”
Richardson, Abel, and Hayward, must have been sorry to
observe that the two bowlers had 39 runs knocked off
them for no wickets. The match was won by the bowlers
who didn’t strike, but in batting the three malcontents
came out well with a score of 71 for four wickets, Richard-
son carrying his bat each time, whereas Peel, Lilley and
Hearne made only 17 among them.
* * • •
Captain Trott was clearly responsible for some
of the 66 runs by which All-England won the test-match.
He allowed Giffen to be punished to the tune of 64 runs
for two wickets when he might have done much better
with M‘Kibbin. Mac’s two wickets for the first innings
cost only 21 runs. Grace didn’t make so much mistake
with Richardson, for the tall fellow was taken off for good
and all when he had given Australia 22 runs and about
eight sundries. All-England, by the way, scored 75 more
off the bat than the other men, who had 14 sundries—as
against three—in their grand total of 163.
* * * *
London Referee struck the weak point in
Prince Ranji’s claim to play for All England by suggesting
the possibility of several 'Ranjis blossoming at one time
for England or Australia. A whole team of Ranjis, for
instance, would be an absurdity in either case. They
wouldn’t represent England or Australia. Therefore one
Ranji playing for either country against the other in a re-
presentative match is an absurdity.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —Let us criticise the Australian
Eleven’s record from an English barracker’s standpoint.
The seven strongest teams matched against them have
been Lord Sheffield’s, Midland Counties (which was cer-
tainly stronger than the scratch lot of Players, or North
of England), M.C.C. (twice), and All England (thrice). Of
these seven games Australia has captured one and practi-
cally lost six, although two of them were draws. The
Australian performances in London, up to time of writing,
are three defeats, one draw, which saved defeat, and one
win against Surrey. And they have made three collapses
in London for iB, 53, and 44 respectively.— Rubsino
Faxin.
* * * »
Three batsmen ran a dead heat for highest
aggregate score in the test-match —Darling, Abel and
Jackson, each 47. Nine All-England scores touched
double figures, and three men got “ducks.” For Aus-
tralia, there were five double-figure scores and six
“ ducks.” Peel was the only man who bagged a pair of
birds.
* * * *
The third test-match proved nothing, except
that two English bowlers on a soft wicket were able to
beat the performances of the most successful Australian
bowler —which is a very unusual, if not unprecedented,
occurrence. Perhaps Ail-England won the match through
winning the toss, and starting its first innings on a
wicket that was rather too wet for the bow'lers; but, on
the other hand, it seems that the Australians started their
first innings under fairly easy run-making conditions.
The ground then would remain good for awhile after
being rolled. Anyway, Iredale and Darling scored 76
runs before Iredale ran himself out. From that time for-
ward there was no considerable stand made on either side,
but the Englishmen did not fail so steadily and persist-
ently as the Australians. Here are the figures :
On either side the last men in were able to make a few
runs. Australia suffered two “run-outs,” and one of
these (Iredale’s) probably represented a loss of several pips
to the total. Abel was the only man to bat well at both
attempts.

Frederick Acheson, shot at Louth (N.S.W.)
by a woman of whose land he was taking posses-
sion under legal process, was last week taken to
Sydney Hospital in the hope that the bullet which
had entered his thigh through the groin might be
located. This was accomplished per the beneficent
medium of the Rontgen ray process, operated by
Mr. Schmidlin, the Elizabeth-street electrician.
The result was an entire and gratifying success.
The jiortion of the thigh bone “ shadowgraphed ”
came out clearly, and the bullet was also very
distinct. Dr. Bowker removed it next day with-
out difficulty.
So far as is known, every man

Apropos Henniker Heaton’s state-
ment that Parkes “ hesitated to speak

in the Balmain tram in the same com-
partment as the veteran. Another

to attract Parkes’ attention and “passed
the time of day.” “Hidon’t think Hi

H. H. Champion has taken up

promptly put the case into the hands
o a sodoitor, who quite as promptly
got an order against the father, who
even more promptly “ cleared ” to
another province. H.H. then showed
that he was a practical philanthropist
by obtaining employment for the girl,
and she and her child are now com-
paratively comfortable. The Bulletin
admires Champion’s generosity, but
fears that he will find himself every
morning become the involuntary bailee
of at least six bundles, of baby, and that
soon he will have to turn his office into
a foundling-asylum.
The Bartlett who married Baroness Bur-
dett-Coutts fifteen years ago, celebrated his forty-

The most amusing phase of the late Ameru

Counsel’s opinion was lately sought by a

“ F.” writes from Melbourne :
Dear Bulletin,—A few weeks ago, you allowed a cor-
respondent to splash whitewash over lawyer Geake, the
fraudulent Daylesford trustee who was quietly sneaking
from justice when The Bulletin called attention to his
figure in the distance. Your correspondent described
Geake as a generous, lovable sort of person, incapable of
canting hypocrisy, and I would now like to ask him (your
correspondent) where he picked up his picture of the miss-
ing attorney. Geake, like all “respectable” embezzlers,
from Jabez Balfour downward, was a loathsome hypocrite.
Upon receiving cash for investment, he would invite the
dupe to join him in a prayer for God’s blessing on the
transaction. Clients have knelt beside him in his office.
A widow lady, who entrusted her property to Geake’s
care, tells me that he several times persuaded her against
withdrawing any principal, but he was very punctual with
the interest, a cheque for which was invariably enclosed
along with a tract. Geake was a large distributor of
tracts and a wholesale dealer in Bible texts. It doesn’t
seem kind to hurl the fellow’s mock-piety at him now
that he is down, but plain truth is better than ornamental
fiction, therefore I write to contradict the yarn that Geake
was not a hypocrite. The world cannot be too often in-
formed that every business-man who makes open profes-
sion of piety is a highly probable Barabbas.

ment on the seventh.
The untimely death of Kitz in Melb. the
other day removes the crack Australian wine-
expert of his city. The Kitzes were almost
pioneers in the endeavor to popularise native
wines. They had their reward, to be sure : Kitz
winged his way to the empyrean from one of the
most luxurious homes in the Melb. suburbs.
Your Kitz is the necessary complement of the
Castellas, Fallons, Morrises, and other vignerons,
the beneficent middle-man with whom nobody
quarrels.
Barlow, associate successively to Judges
Kerferd, Higinbotham and Madden, has been
sedulously collecting persiflage, tags, anecdotes,
and reminiscences of the Vic. Bench, Bar, jury-
room, and dock during his long court career.
When he publishes, some interesting matter may
be confidently expected.
Out of the £300,000 netted by the divi-
dendaires of Mt. Morgan last year, that soulless
corporation disgorged in donations the magnificent
sum of £3O. “ The Mountmorganaires,” remarked
a Sydneyite the other day, “ are a noble lot. Their
chief characteristic is that almost every man
Jack of them is a Johnny Woodser.”
Mr. Cheke, one of the Vic. Supreme Court
taxing-officers, is a relative of the late N.S.W.
Judge Cheke and a lineal descendant of the
Cheke who was famous for something or other
(there’s a book about it somewhere) in Bloody
Mary’s reign. (She was some sort of a queen in a
place called England, or some such name.)
Thomas Walker, ex-M.L.A. (N.S.W.), is
on the avid look-out for a seat in Maoriland House
of Representatives. Sydney’s one-time Free-
thought lecturer Collins is now a member of that
advanced body. Also, poor pastor Laseron, who
still has in him an unlocated bullet from Tommy
Walker’s revolver, thinks of appealing to the
Rontgen rays.
M‘Millan, M.P., who introduced a depu-
tation to Premier Reid last week, for the purpose
of pressing on the Government the duty of ex-
tending the railway through the city of Sydney,
is related to the James Macarthur who headed
the first deputation that appealed to the Governor
to direct the laying of the first N.S.W. railway
line, fifty years ago.
Ed. Bulletin, —Be the question “ whether
a sheriff would be received into decent society did
the exigencies of his office at any time demand
that he should himself perform an execution,” it
should be remembered that President Cleveland,
the tin-god of the Australian Freetrade party,
once turned a couple of men off when acting in
sheriff’s capacity.—M.G.
The Duke of York is not coming to Aus-
tralia. After what has of late happened in the
British royal family no sane person really ever
thought he would come. The equerry who was inter-
viewed on the subject by the London correspond-
ent of S.A. Advertiser, remarked, apropos the
printed statement that the Royal couple were
coming out in the fast crusier Blenheim, that that
vessel had only the other day served as Prince
Henry of Battenberg’s hearse, and that it was un-
likely the deceased’s nephew and niece would use
it so soon after for a pleasure cruise. Truly a
delicate distinction to be drawn on behalf of the
Duke, who married his elder brother’s fiancee
only a few months after that brother’s death.
Walter Besant, as an ennobbled Britisher,
seems now to regret that he betrayed a Republican
hoof at prophet Stead’s recent London meeting.
Besant prophesied that Australia (amongst other
cited British dependencies) would become a
“ great nation,” that it won’t “continue for any
great length of time the fiction of dependence ” on
England, and that its (at present merely practical)
Republicanism will announce itself in fact and
law. Per contra, as an English ennobblee, he
assumed that monarchism would strengthen in
England. This means that Mr. Besant couldn’t
help himself. In the abandon of oratory, the
logic of Democratic insight ran away with him;
when he remembered the monarchial handle to his
name, and his acceptance of the Queen’s menial
livery, he was bound to justify his feudal sub-
servience.
The poet- warrior-politician Neild’s some-
what sudden departure for England has more
than roving restlessness as a cause. Jawbone
designs, it is said, a raid on the English Bar,
and hopes to carry back with him to Australia a
wig and gown. It is, putting all things together,
ever so much easier for an Australian to get eal.ed
to the Bar in England than it is in Australia.
Judge Hartley Williams, who retires from
the Vic. Bench next year (and will probably be
succeeded by Equity-barrister Higgins) is in poli-
tics a Radical, and in religion a pronounced
Rationalist, of the type of Chief Justice Higin-
botham and Dr. Pearson. Of his colleagues on
the Bench, four—Hood, A’Beckett, Hodges and
Holroyd —are Anglican, and Madden, C.J., is by
education a Roman Catholic, .and by practice
nothing in particular.
A Sydney historical writer has obtained
through a London correspondent documentary
proof that an immediate ancestress of Governor
Bligh went mad. It is not generally known that
one of Bligh’s descendants became insane, and it
was a common statement, referring to the Gover-
nor, in Sydney during the period immediately
preceding the Rum Rebellion, “Oh, he’s mad !
An interesting side-light on a stormy epoch of
Australian history.
Leaving one night in the “ seventies ’ the
cottage in Hunter-street, Sydney, where were held
the meetings of the debating society in _ which so
many N.S.W. public men developed their gaseous
faculties, G. H. Reid said to a companion: “I
have never read five books in my life.” Later m
the conversation he remarked : “ I would like to
be Premier of the colony—that is my ambition.”
His companion threw at him sententiously Car-
lyle’s generalisation that “ One’s wishes are pre-
sentiments of one’s achievements.” That man
evidently confirmed the aspirations of G.H.R.—
who has still the same incapacity for reading books.
“Robertson, who sent the letter the
other day to Madden, C.J., protesting against
that much-over-ruled dignitary adjudicating on
the Commercial Bank reconstruction scheme on
the ground that he is not a ‘ gold-expert ’ is,”
writes a Bulletin contributor, “ quite an original
in his way. He was an inspector in Vic. State
schools at a snug salary, but, finding that his
continual protests against the wooden methods of
the department were fruitless, he resigned for
conscience sake, and tried to get a living by start-
ing at Essendon a school which he runs on the
lines laid down by the most advanced German
professors of pedagogy. He has a magnificent
library of several thousand volumes on philosophy,
literature and currency, double-banked round the
schoolroom. His great hobby is currency, about
which he has probably thought and read more
than any other man. To him it is not a mere
branch of social science, it is a religion, nay, more ;
many religions, properly considered, are only
divinely - ordained compensations for defecti '•<*

currency-systems. For instance, the doctrine of
self-abnegation so prominent in Buddhism, and so
much talked about in Christianity, is to him an
instinctive recognition by conscience-smitten man
of unjust gains obtained by an all-pervading
defective currency. It is even said that he was
with difficulty dissuaded by his friends from
naming one of his children ‘ Currency. ’ He sees
in reformed currency a cure for evils usually
thought (and once thought so by him) only curable
by revolutionary methods. His system is, roughly,
to recognise as the basis of currency not only gold,
but all articles which have what he calls an ‘ inter-
national value.’ He has also developed sliding
scales and automatic regulators for the proper
working of his system. The Melb. papers refuse
to insert his letters, the Banking Commission
ignored him—so that he has now tried, with at
least the success of publicity, a new method. One
wonders whether this quiet, neuralgia-tortured,
Essendon master of arts, neglected and laughed
at now, will one day, with his intense moral
earnestness, be recognised as the Moses or the
Mahomet of a new departure in civilisation.’

“ I suffered for years with complication of the
heart, which several doctors told me was caused
by weakness of the kidneys. Medical advisers

“ Wonderful Medicine ! I suffered from pains
in my back and in my side, loss of sleep, and
dropsy. Being despondent over my doctor’s
failure to relieve after 12 months’ treatment, I
tried Warner’s Safe Cure. After using 3 bottles,
the swelling had disappeared, the pains had left
me, and I slept well, and was well. ”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Sydney’s Mayor, Ives, says that Australia
began to go down when assisted-immigration was
stopped.
Hughes, M.L.A., speaking on N.S.W.
Factories Bill, said: “ Every Chinaman should
lee deemed a factory, and be compelled to consume
his own smoke.”
By some extraordinary blunder—or worse
—the annual report of the Australasian Federa-
tion League did not contain a single reference to
Parkes, over whom the League was wont to gush
as the “ Father of Federation.”
“ Some time ago,” writes a Bulletin cor-
respondent, “ two men, who were then suing for
wages in a western N.S.W. Police-court, deliber-
ately swore that they were dummy homestead
lessees, they made no bones about it; they gave
date and place, and named their employers. No
notice was taken by the authorities. The present
Ministry was not in power. ”
A- hint. When the
Maoris of the King
country are holding a Par-
liamentary session, the
Upper House is only al-
lowed one meal a day till
it puts through bills sent
up by the Lower House.
N.S. Wales’Post and
Telegraph Department
revenue for 189.) was
<£115,373 short of working
expenses, and <£211,233
short of working expenses
and interest on borrowed
money. The curious fea-
ture about the Post-office
is that no one worries about
the stupendous deficit. The
railway shortage sat on
everybody’s soul till at
last the country imported
the best expert it could
find, and paid him a big
salary for the express pur-
pose of putting the service
on a business footing and
making it pay its way if
possible. And meanwhile
any miserable kind of
politician any Cook or
Kidd or Dan O’Connor—
is allowed to run the other
department, and nobody
seems in the least inter-
ested about the leakage.
The Post-office wants quite
as much as the railways
to be bossed by a capable
expert permanently em-
ployed, with instructions
to run things on business
lines and make the dread-
ful institution pay its way
or kill somebody in the
attempt.
It has been proposed by some of Sydney’s
forward women’s-righters that an agitation shall
be started to make invalid married men’s agree-
ments relating to property, unless said agreements
are countersigned by the wife.
Hancock declares that he has asserted all
along that the Vic. railways savings could have
been effected only by allowing stock and perma-
nent-way to fall into disrepair. But he didn’t
assert it at the top of his voice.
Why are the Hindoos, Sikhs, Lascars,
Levantines, and all the brindle-colored crowd that
poke about Australia with a basket of goods and
a threatening scowl always called Assyrians ?
A Maoriland departmental report suggests that it
is because “ they came down like a wolf on the
fold.” Which is the nearest approach to an
intentional joke this paper ever saw in a depart-
mental report.
Legislation carried in N.S.W. Assembly in
the small hours of the morning goes to the Upper
House with the mark of the Beast on it. Every
hour after 11 p.m. the influence of the Labor-
party increases, so that by 3 or 4 a.m., instead of
being one-sixth of the total voting power, they
become one-third, and sometimes one-half. Which
fact prejudices the Council against all Bills put
through the Assembly after midnight.
N.S.W. Postmaster-Gen. Cook said, in a
recent address on “ sweating,” that men wearing
garments made by sweated labor are wearing the
blood and bone of their starving fellow-creatures.
And Affleck, M.L.A., remarks just here that
Cook’s department gets the coats worn by the
postmen made at Is. lid. each, and the price cf
lining, thread, and buttons has to come out of
this Is..lid. Either Afffeck, M.L.A., is very ui -
reliable, or P.M.G. Cook, of the God-fearh
; Ministry, is the last man in N.S-.W. who shouh.
talk about sweating.
DearBuLLETiN, —Despite thegood qualitie B
of Vale, who has just resigned his honorary port-
folio in the Turner Ministry, he is most unpopular
in the House. He is a Bore, and has a fixed
conviction that he is the only fit and proper
person to be Premier. The man utterly un-
popular in Parliament can do nothing in Parlia-
ment, no matter how well he may manage to work
his constituents. —Z.
Pickaxe : ‘ ‘ The Vic. Labor-party is vir-
tually without a leader. Hancock doesn’t do.
For one thing, he is not whole-souled with Labor,
and his versatility in preparing to start a news-
paper, which should emphatically be not a Labor
organ, is thought “ a little too much.” He is a
balancer, an opportunist, and too much of the
Farceur, whereas Labor is desperately serious,
being apt to get hungry. ”
Bananaland Leg. Assembly has raised
members’ salaries to £3OO per annum, also enacting
that said salaries can only be interfered with on a
two-thirds majority. A bare majority (be it noted)
sufficed to raise salaries so far, but a bare majority
cannot again reduce them. The other civil ser-
vants (for an M.L. A. is but a civil servant) want
to know why tteeir salaries cannot be secured in
fche same highly-satisfactory manner.
Foster Rogers, M.L.A. for South Yarra,
quoted The Bulletin’s article on Australia’s rule-
of-thumb financiers in his speech on the Turner
Budget. “The Bulletin,” said Rogers, “has
some good things in it, and some that are [not
quite so good.” Well, so has the Bible, the Koran,
the Dhammapada, the Vedas, the Talmud, and
other sacred works. The Bulletin only desires
to stand on a level with them so far as general
excellence is concerned.
PORTRAIT OF THE REAL REID SURPLUS .
Under a wise provision in the Maoriland
Old-Age Pension scheme, no pensioner is to receive
his allowance while absent from the country.
Maoriland doesn’t want to make any more ab-
sentees. Also, the pension stops while the pen-
sioner is in gaol, the State annexing the 10s. a
week to keep the aged criminal.
AUSTRALIA FOR THE AUSTRALIANS.
Sunday scene in “Lilly Bluke”-street, Melb.—
showing how the Chinese invasion is progressing.
Sargood, M.L.C., the Melb. Calico Jimmy,
says that the Vic. second chamber, the chamber of
?>°!i if: horrors, only wants power over money
77 1 ~ to make it perfect as a democratic institu-
tion. Pure gall, when the democracy knows that
the Leg. Council disqualifications are its only
recommendations.
The M.L. lory party’s vote of censure on
the beddon Government was defeated by a stu-
pendous majority. Even the people who objected
to beddon borrowing one million couldn’t very
well throw him out when the alternative was put-
ting in Bussell, who not long since advocated bor-
rowmg twenty millions. And the speotacle of the
zu-miliion borrowing man moving a vote of cen-
sure on the other man for borrowing one million
was a lovely hunk of humor.
In reference to the cry that Bogan district
(N.S.W.) squatters are eaten out of lease and land
by kangaroos, a Bulletin correspondent points
out that at least some lessees deliberately preserve
kangaroos, and charge shooters, say, <£l per week
for clearing their paddocks of the “ noxious ver-
min,” whose presence, it is suggested, should
knock |d. an acre off the rent.
“ The Premier is a
professional politician, de-
pending on politics for a
living, and it is only on
rare occasions that men
of this class risk office for
the sake of principle.’
The lofty Duke who writes
thus scornfully of profes-
sional politicians in the
leading columns of the
Australian Star should
be laid across Dibbs’ knee
and given “ what for ”
with both hands. In fact,
the entire body of effec-
tive N.S.W. Protectionist
members should submit
him to a battery of whole-
some slaps.
Caldwell’s S.A. Par-
liamentary Privilege Act
Amendment Bill provides
that the utterances of any
M.P. shall not be privi-
leged in respect of the law
of defamation. Such a law,
while tending to make an
M.P. more careful and as
responsible for his utter-
ances as a newspaper
editor, a speaker at a pub-
lic meeting, or even the
man in the street, in ordi-
nary cases, would, in many
special cases, gag him
when he should be allowed
his mouth. Newspaper
men know many unsavory
things to be absolute facts,
and yet know frequently
the almost impossibility
of being able, or even
likely, to prove them in a
court of law. Members of
Parliament must also know
many such things. Fur-
ther, if an M.P. is to be
debarred from “privi-
lege” in “the House,”
why not a solicitor in a
court of law? Caldwell’s
proposal is utterly inex-
pedient, and anyhow will
not be carried. The habi-
tual, gratuitous slanderer
is not often elected to Par-
liament.
Nearly 5000 Tasmanian children never
attend school. The whole population is 160,000,
so the percentage of unlettered is high. Education
is not “ free and compulsory,” so the private semi-
denominational system is successfully teaching
the Tassies less than they know already.
Premier Reid, a year or two ago : “I shall
always oppose a land-tax until we have a proper
system of Local Government.” And where is
that Local Government Bill now ? Apparently it
has dropped so utterly out of all knowledge that
things are practically where they were 20 years
back.
Dr. Renwick’s principal argument in
N.S.W. Leg. Council against Dr. Cullen’s Bill to
reform the method of election and tenure of office
of members of Sydney University Senate was that
the Senate has. not asked for the Bill. The argu-
nient contributed largely to successfully shelve the
proposal to reform. When, then, in the near
future, the promised Bill reforming the same Leg.
Council reaches that logically-behaving body, it is
P resume d that some Renwick of the time
will move to shelve it on similar grounds. Cer-
tainly the Leg. Council will not have asked for
such a Bill.
The N.S.W. Government has accepted,
not the lowest, but the second lowest tender for
the new Gundagai bridge, because it came from a
local contractor—the lowest tender came from
Melbourne. Wherefore the public is to pay more
than is necessary for its bridge in order to bolster
n<^u , - tiie said industry is to be
subsidised at the expense of the taxpayer, instead
Btf mdmg alone in the “ bracing air of Free-
tiade and the various horrors of Protection
which the Government lives by denouncing are
surreptitiously let loose on the land. Why can’t
Keid and Co. have the courage of their alleged
opinions ? &
Premier Reid, dealing with Cope-
land’s championship of a Monroe doc-
trine for Australia, committed himself
to the opinion that Australia took
possession of Maoriland, thus going
outside her boundaries at the very start.
This view is incorrect. Maoriland, as
New Zealand, was gazetted a British
dominion in 1787 in virtue of the
sovereignty established by Captain
Cook, and never was any more a posses-
sion of Australia than, is Australia of
British New Guinea.
Premier Reid, being questioned in N.S.W.
Assembly concerning Jack Want’s promised “re*
port on Japan,” &c., promised to have “ a search ”
made for the document :
N. : “Australia is strewn with the human
wrecks of ardent enthusiasts in political life •
Freetraders, Protectionists, National Bankists"
Socialists, Christians, men who have dashed into
the machine and retired mangled because of their
poverty. Politics are only meant for the individual
with lots of money ; and cost him nothing. From
him that hath not is taken even that he hath.”
FLORAL TRIBUTES.
JOUNNIE : “ You might give me your roses, doncherknow."
HEBE: “ I can’t. I'm wearing them for a gentleman. He sends them
to me in the morning so that I can take them from my dress
and give them to him at luncheon-time when the bar it
crowded.”
N.S.W. ex-Treas. See objects to the con-
struction of electric trams in George-street, Sydney,
because they will deprive farmers of work growing
feed for ’bus-horses. The same-objection applies
to all the tramways and railways in the country,
and to John See's own steamers ; they all deprive
the farmer of work in growing feed for the horses
and bullocks that might have humped goods and
travellers all over N.S.W. Therefore Mr. See
should abjure railways and trams and steamers,
and go home per buliock-dray, and live up to his
own great theory.
Search high, search low, search far, search near •
Search places likely, places queer;
Search pigeon-holes, or small, or big;
Search Jack, his pockets, boots, and wig •
Search Crown Law Offices, the lot; ’
Search Want, his chambers, and his yacht;
Search fishing-baskets, luncheon-bags,
Gun-cases, lockers, four-hand drags,
The private clubs, more private bowers,
Where Johnny passes.quiet hours ;
And when you’ve searched, and searched in vain
Bull’s-eye the search on Jacky’s brain ;
And seize the store th’ enamoured chap
Retains regarding Japs and Jap—
The honeyed tour, the heathen Christmas,
The almond-optical strabismus
That lures the fancy’s finger-tips on,
That Mem’ry ever licks its lips on !
Let Freetrade tariffs balance short,
Let stark stagnation blight “ the court,"
Flaccidity usurp all sport,
But let us have that Jap. report.

The Morning Post said of Australia v. The
Players: “The colonial Eleven deserve the warmest
praise for the manner in which they utilised their oppor-
tunities. At times the cricket became a little slow to
watch, and, when they had the bowlers at their mercy,
one could have wished that the batsmen had played a
freer game, but the method adopted in Australia of plac-
ing no limit as to the time over which a match shall
extend has caused most of the batsmen now with us to
wait for their opportunities and run no risks.”

Shrewsbury was left out of the Gentlemen v.

Nice point of cricket etiquette over this year’s

C.M.G. : “ Every success of Jones’ is followed
by murmurs in the English press re the unfairness of his
deli/enes. If the Australians win the next test with
conspicuous assistance from the Adelaide scorcher, his
unfairness is sure to be unanimously and emphatically
asserted at’Ome. But they have bought over “Jonah”
with all faults, and once he becomes a British possession
all doubts will be set at rest according to the venerable
J.B. maxim, 4 What is (ours)is best.*”

N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League meeting last Satur-
day at Sydney Agricultu al Ground drew a good crowd, de-
spite the wet and biting cold. The honors and cash of the
occasion go to W. Davison, of Hillgrove, N.S.W. This
young man frem the country won the Hampden Wheel
Race (±5O), 2 mi es, and the First Class Handicap (£10),
miles. In his heat of the Winter Stakes (he should
win the final next Saturday) he led his field and made the
pace against a strong wind, and in the straight he sprinted
away from Chapman (N.S.W.), Clinton and Don Walker
(Vic.). In the Hampden final he led the last three laps ;
and at the finish broke all his men up with liis faster pace
and won in champion style. He won the First Class
yards. His handicaps for the Hampden and
First Class were respectively 185 and 130 yards, but they
do not detract from his performance.
The great Bill Martin received a gruelling.
His only place was third in the First Class Handicap
The sturdy Yank seems to have rather lost his head ; tie
hasn’t been riding a winning race lately. He “slung”
the Humber people for the Stearns, and the Stearns for
the Dux, and it is said he is now quarrelling with his last
love. The entanglement of business seems to have
entered into his riding; he didn’t show any of his splendid
pace or decision this time.
xt le new American, ran third in the
N.S.W. Championship, and didn't do anything to raise
hair with surprise. He has matched himself for ±lOO
against Martin.
Ken Lewis won the N.S. Wales Chamion-
ship G mile £10), also his heat, by gamely brilliant
riding. In the final Martin started his old-time long
sprint m the last lap, but was cut down in the straight
and beaten home by Lewis, O’Brien (N.S.W.), and
McDoneil. v
Don Walker (Vie.) showed a Zimmerman-down-
lng-spnnt in his heat for the N.S.W. Championship.
Yankee McDoneil was winning but in the last 20yds.
Walker pedalled home quicker than the Yank could think.
Porta was certain that he, not Middleton, ran
second to Walker in his heat of the N.S.W. Champion-
ship. When Middleton’s number went up for second
place Porta, came out and protested. “ Oxcuse me,
gentlemen, Porta second by half-yard ” ; and he held out
ms light arm and then, with his ieft hand, notched upon
it how good the half-yard was.
Meadham (N.S.W.) rode with great judgment
and pluck in his heat of the Hampden Wheel Race, beat-
ing Walne (Q.) and Ken Lewis (M.L.).
Marsehner, the German trick cyclist, brought
down the house with sensational feats, which crave the
notion thatjie wore a pair of invisible wings.
r l he Victorian League has decided not to sanc-
tion outside promoters, except in a few instances. The
league runs only one meeting a year itself, and its dog-in-
the-manger policy will probably be reversed by the new
council.
* * * *
The match between Martin and M'Donell is to
be run on novel lines. The men start together, but ride
in opposite directions. This will make the contest dull
from a spectacular point of view, but the dulness will be
compensated for by the possibility of a smash every time
the men meet, and the gentle public dearly loves its

The alleged world’s record put up by cyclist
I arsons at Chicago turns out to be 1 min. 54 l-sth sec.,
standing start, or § sec. slower than Gibbons-Brooks’
English best. The Yankee recognised record, by J. S.
Johnson, stands at 1 min. 50 sec., and a dozen’Murkan
riders have put up miles between this and the English
time. In any case, there would be little incentive held
out to the Australian to beat Johnson’s time, considering*
that both men are members of the same trade team)
Whethei 1 arsons can beat it or not is, of course, oues-
tionable, and what has to be reckoned out is the capa-
bility, on a perfect track* with perfect pacing, of a man
who, with indifferent both, turned off the distance in
1 min. 58 2-sth sec. Does this equal more or less than
1 nun. 50sec. ?

The winner of the Half-mile Championship at
Sydney League’s meeting was largely starred as “ Ken
Lewis, of Maoriland, ’ apparently to impress the public
with the width of the field which supplied the entries.
As a matter of fact, Lewis is a Melb. native who spent
three or four years in Maoriland, returning to his native
cabbage-garden about two years ago. Another alleged
Maorilander is Either, born in England, and with the
last five years divided between Melb. and Sydney
The newest French bicycle is made chiefly of

The Rand wielc-Wallaroo argument settler was
the Sydney football game of the winter. Both sides took
it in turns to score and run over each other, and uncer-
tainty prevailed to the last. Consequently the yelling
crowd, including a feminine battalion of cart-wheel hats,
was hoarse long before gas-light. Rands, were five ahead
until Gardiner organised a working bee ; a try was scored,
and a goal kicked in a borrowed boot. Result : 16 all,
and everyone satisfied.
* * * •
Saturday saw the downfall of the two leading
senior Melt), football-clubs. Essendon’s game against 8.
Melb., before the larg-est crowd of the season, was full of
incident and good play. The scores in the first and third
quarters were even, but South’s doggedness and good con-
dition brought them home winners by 6g. 6b: to 3g.
Melb. v. Collingwood was a hard tussle. After
.much preliminary good football, Melb. led by 3g. to 1 at
half-time. From that out it seemed anyone’s match
until nearing the finish the “red-legs” got two more
goals, and finished up with 6g. Bb. to Coiling wood’s 4g. 3b.
South, Essen don, and Collingwood now stand
equal at the head of the premiership list. To-day (22nd)
South play Collingwood, and Essendon Melb. South and
Essendon should win.
North Melbourne beat Richmond 19g. 12b. to
4g. 4b.—season’s record. Larkin kicked 6 goals : another
record. In the other matches, Port Melb. beat Williams-
town sg. to 2g. Footscray beat Carlton 7g. to 4g., and
Fitzroy beat Geelong lOg. to sg.
* * * *
Though less interest is taken in Melb. football
than for twenty years past, the present season is really
the best-contested on record. The defeat of Essendon by
South and Collingwood by Melb. places the three first-
named clubs on an equality, a thing which has not oc-
curred at this time of the season within the memory of
the oldest barraeker. In ’B7 South and Geelong were
level until tneir second meeting at the beginning of Sep-
tember placed the Pivotians on top, but no other club
stood within oooee of either. Between ’B7 and to-day one
team has invariably topped the list with a fair lead, and
the premiership has, by the middle of August, always
been a settled fact.

S.A. v. Victoria lacrosse match, in Adelaide,
proved a runaway victory for S.A. by 13 goals to nil,
though Victoria had almost her best, team. Despite
counter attractions there were nearly 4000 spectators, an
illustration of the strides the Canadian game is making in
Adelaide. How long before a representative Australian
lacrosse team visits Eng. and Canada?
* * * *
In Adelaide lacrosse seems already to have un-
dermined football. Senior football teams find great diffi-
culty in securing recruits, and as for the public—there
were 500 people present at the match, Norwood v. South,
on Aug. 1. At same match last year, about 5000 !

Westralia will send East an eight-oared crew to
compete in the next Interprovincial contest. At the pre-
sent time the West has the cream of Australia’s amateur
rowing men to pick from, but all are merely transferred
Easterners, and no native Westralian has a “ possible ” of
a seat in the boat.
* * * *
Dear Bulletin, —Stanbury's objections to row-
ing Gaudaur at Prillia were groundless. Situated on Lake
Simcoe, one of the loveliest sheets of fresh water in
America, without tides or currents, it is but two hours’
railway journey from Toronto (Iranian’s home) and four
from Niagara Falls, and is in every way an ideal spot for
a rowing contest. The “ red Indians ” exist in Stanbury’s
mind, while the only ice he could get in the boating
season would he the lump the bar-tender might put in his
cocktail. And Gaudaur is not a ’Murkan, but a French-
Canadian, born and raised near Montreal, and if the
“loyal ” protests of Canada go for anything, as much a
“colonial” as Stanbury. Let us be exact.—One Who
Knows.
* * * *
A sporting syndicate has cabled ’Ome a big sum
for investment on Stanbury in his match with Gaudaur.
The Harding match, regarded as somewhat uncertain,
elicited little local speculation. Sydney sports dearly love
“ morals.”
* * * *
Hawkesbury “ townies ” of sculler Towns are
allegedly willing to put up any amount for a go at Stan-
bury if their man beats Neilsen on 29th inst. This is the
sort of enthusiasm that gives a fillip to a good sport. The
young aspirant should be a better paddler a year or two
hence. Peter Kemp is fining him down, but racing for
cash is admirable schooling.
* * * *
The stroke of the Maoriland Four which lately
visited Sydney writes to Tiie Bulletin “ A paragraph
in your paper states that a rumor is current in Sydney
that the M.L. crew were drugged a few days before com-
peting in the Interprovincial Fours. I wish to give such a
report an emphatic denial. No crew was ever, or could
be ever, treated with greater kindness and consideration
than were the M.L. crew by all the Sydney residents with
whom they came in contact. 1 deeply regret that such a
report should have been spread about. George B.
Richardson.” [Very likely but, all the same, certain
members of that crew believed, or affected to believe, that
poison had been put into a meal taken by them at a Svdney
caravanserai. It was agreed that, as the thing could not
he absolutely proved, nothing should be said about the
matter ; but “ that which is known to more than one is
no longer a secret.”—Ed. B.]

tion of a Criminal Code for N.S.W., and the abrogation of
the 1001 musty Acts under which a policeman can demand
to see your singlet and the receipt for your hoots.

The bould O’Halloran seems to have adopted
The Bulletin’s suggestion by getting rid of Dowry. The
filly won a selling-race at Caulfield last Saturday, and was
knocked down to J. Leek for 80 guineas, all of which went
to the fund.
* * * *
Barbarian, the horse that ran third for last
Melb. Cup and subsequently got knocked about in the
F.R.C. Handicap, was backed to win a welter-race atCaul-
field last Saturday, but he cut up badly. Barbarian will
do better anon, like Devon and Marusa, both of whom
earned some money unsuccessfully at the same meeting.
Phe Miller stable is so much out of form lately
that it may be expected to bloom in the spring when by
the way the red and white jacket will probably make a
good bid for the V.R.C. Derby.
* * * *
Wallace, Delaware, Preston, The Parisienneand
Tire are the principal Metrop. Stake absentees. Wilson’s
chestnut may not start at all before Melb. Cup. The void
created by 24 scratches isn’t very perceptible.’ Toreador
still signals danger, and if Destiny comes over he mav
make things hot. J
*'* * *
A.J.C. entries promise several races between
some of the alleged best three-year-olds. Which mav or
may not give a line for Derby or Cup. Newhaven is
sprinkled over the list, but has shirked three-mile Rand
wick Plate, for which Coil will start.
* * » *
Larrikin’s victory in Vic. Club Steeple Saturday
will cause speculation as to how good he is. His field
were mostly “rags,” but he wiped them out in a canter.
Larrikin is one of those ’chasers who race best when be-
yond juvenility. The old sinner is now aged 9 years The
late Tommy Corrigan p edicted that the horse would vet
win a Grand National. J
Marusa and Miraculum is not a much-booked
Cup double. Still a maiden, Marusa got put down once
again in Vic. Club mile Saturday by Excel. Redfearn’s
chestnut wants heaps of condition and luck, the latter
preferably.

One swell Sydney bookie has now stepped down
to a silver connection. Spot cash, though small, is often
better than a dubious fiver “on the nod.” The incidental
cronkness is the only thing against a silver biz. If an
honest tote-man happened along, Sydney would give him
a fortune in no time.
♦ * * *
The art of bringing horses together per light
and heavy lead-bags is rarely exemplified so strikingly as
in the Northern J.C. (Maitland) Flying Handicap last
week. Tom, Yellow Plush, and Syndicate dead-heated.
The trio ran off, Tom and Yellow Plush tieing again. The
crowd began to get interested when the pair went out a
third time, Tom winning by half-a-head—so the judge
said. Had the jock, on the ultimate loser dropped his cap
in one of the heats, he might have just got home.

A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-street, Melb., a distance of 6Goft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic: 1, New Books ; 2, Second-
hand Books ;3, Stationery; 4, Music ;5, Eancy
Goods; 6, Toys; 7, Perfumery; 8, Pictures.; 9,
Artists’ Materials ; 10, an Ornamental Exhibition ;
11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Child’s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. The
main walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long.*
Why, The Bulletin again asks, has the
public not been officially informed of the cause
why the old Sydney Harbor ferry-steamer Bright-
side, alias Emu, which is now running once more,
lately sank at her moorings? By the way, the
Brightside, for some reason not an over-popular
boat, now has her name painted up in old English
characters which are particularly hard to decipher.
Eno’s “Fruit Salt.”—A lady writes : —“ I
think that you will be glad to hear that I find
your ‘ Fruit Salt ’ a most valuable remedy, and I
can assure you I recommend it to all my friends
and the result is always satisfactory. Everything,
medicine or food, ceased to act properly for at
least three months before I commenced taking it,
the little food I could take generally punished me
or returned. My life was one of great suffering,
so that I must have succumbed before long. To
me and our family it has been a great earthly
blessing. I feel I cannot say too much for it.”

“M.L.A.” to The Bulletin :
M‘Millan’s personal dislike of Reid betrayed him into
Weak and imprudent exaggeration. The public will know
how to judge of his sincerity when they consider that in-
stead of justifying his furious charges of deceit and cor-
ruption by voting against the Govt., he retired from the
chamber immediately after his speech, and is now content
to support an administration which he has publicly and in
the plainest terms accused 'ff serious offences. —D.
As regards his vote, M'Millan’s attitude is per-
fectly logical. A man may not vote with the
Government because he reckons it too bad to be
supported, and not vote with the Opposition
because he reckons it no better. Government by
Contradiction naturally produces deadlocks such
as this.

A TERRIBLE CASE OF
ECZEMA
CURED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. E. Wyatt, of Port Hoad, West
Hindmarsh, So. Australia, writes of
the sad condition of her little daugh-
ter, whose portrait she also sends:
Wi
“My daughter was afflicted with
Eczema of the most aggravated
type. The disease first appeared in
eruptions on her head, then her hair
began to fall out, and in spite of
the best medical advice and treat-
ment she grew steadily worse. The
sores were full of matter and were
extremely offensive. Her eyes be-
came affected, and she was, in truth,
in a terrible state. My neighbors
were very sympathetic and took
great interest in the case. They
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, and I am most thankful to
be able to say that this wonderful
medicine coihpletely restored my
daughter’s health. She has now as
good a head of hair as anyone could
wish, her eyes are perfectly well,
and she is a fine girl of eight years
with every prospect of growing up
to be a strong and healthy woman.”

Mdlle. de Pougy, the beautiful queen of
Parisian demi-mondaines, attempted to commit
suicide the other week. The girl had seemingly
fallen in love with an unreciproeative young
“swell,” and the “horror of her life” began to
pall upon her. A bad look-out for Mdlle. If she
has taken a first dose of poison before her admirers
are dropping off she will get very tired of herself
presently.
The cheerful Butler, now doing ten years’
hard labor for nothing in particular, has owned up
to the charge of highway robbery on which he
was acquitted by a Melb. jury. Two old men
derived particular satisfaction from Butler’s burst
of candour. Mr. M‘Phee’s watch was returned to
the bosom of its lawful owner, and Judge Hol-
royd’s terribly stiff sentence seemed indirectly justi-
fied (a la Windeyer-Dean). Had it been milder
the Crown Law department would not have cared
to guarantee Butler’s safety from a second trial
on the burglary charge.
There died at Hobart, August sth, lex.A
McGregor, M.L.C., aged 75, an important figure
in Tas. shipping circles. He started life as a
shipwright, embarked his savings in a whaling-
vessel, and by some lucky cruises laid the founda-
tions of his fortune. Eventually he became one of
the largest owners and merchants in Tas.—run-
ning quite a fleet of whalers as well as English
and interprovincial traders. Elected to the Legis.
Council in ’BO, as member for Hobart, he retained
his seat till a month or two ago, when failing
health made him resign. He dabbled in mining
and made a lot of money out of the sale of the
Anchor Tin Mine to English investors ; had he
lived he would shortly have figured as defendant
in a suit brought against him by the original
holders of the mine, who do not consider their
side of the transaction satisfactory. It was this
deal which led up to Premier Braddon’s castiga-
tion by local and English press for allowing his
name to appear on the English prospectus as a
director.

J. Garrard, of the N.S.W. God-fearing
Ministry, appeared along with Quong Tart at a
Salvation Army shivoo in Sydney the other night
(what Mandarin Tart wanted there doesn’t ap-
pear, but then Brother Tart is more or less every-
where) and spoke a piece :
He expressed his gratification at being allowed to pre-
side. His sympathies were with them in their work. He
was not a stranger to these proceedings in view of the
fact that he came from a good old Methodist stock.
(Cheers.) And by the grace of God he had been enabled
to do something for the Master during the 25 years’ ser-
vice since he became what was called a “ converted ” man.
(“ Glory,” “ Amen,” and applause.) Some people thought
that it was a disgrace to acknowledge that they had
passed from darkness to light, but he was not built that
way. (“Praise be to God!” “Hallelujah.”) With all
humility, but at the same time with great gratification
and pleasure, he bore tribute to the saving grace of the
Lord Jesus Christ. (Volleys of cheers.) Australia had to
thank God for such an organisation as the Salvation
Army, and for the splendid work it was doing in its
social aspect, and he believed that the Army had dealt
with this social question better than any other section of
Christ’s church.
And then Brother Garrard waved his wild, red
jersey on the Australian atmosphere, and the big-
drum vote (though, of course, he didn’t seek it)
was safe for next election. Hallelujah ! Also
Mahershalalhashbaz ! Likewise Jeroboam !!

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of yout Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can _ with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,

Abridged Prospers of tf>« MOUNT LYELL 60LDEN FLUX SUPPLY COMPANY, MoftQt Lyell, TaSipapia.
TO BE REGISTERED AS A NO-LIABILITY COMPANY.
CAPITA!,: ... ... £35,000, in 70,000 Shares of 70s. Each. All Fully Paid-up .
50,000 Shares fully paid up to 10s. per Share are now offered to the public at 2s. each; payable—ls. on application; Is. on allotment; out of the proceeds of which £2400 pet is placed to the credit of the company for working
ra ital, which is considered more than sufficient for all purposes. 10,000 Shares held in reserve for future issue if any further capital should be required, and 30,000 Shares go to the vendors in part payment for the property. No Calls.
All Shares fully paid up. THE VENDORS PAY ALL BROKERAGE AND FLOTATION EXPENSES. DIRECTORS and AUDITORS, &c., to be Appointed at First Meeting of Shareholders,
This company is being formed for the purpose of supplying the Mount Lyell Company with a flux (silica) containing
gold, the pres ;nce of which in same would result in a considerable extra profit per ton being made on all ore treated
by them, as, vide Dr. Peter’s report, a silica, i.e., flux, is absolutely necessary for smelting the Mount Lyell ores ; and
the flux, or silica, now being obtained and used by them is of no intrinsic value it follows that their being supplied
with a flux containing even a fair percentage of gold would result, as stated above, in a substantial extra profit on
their smelting operations. The advantage, therefore, to the Mount Lyell Company in obtaining a flux of this kind is
very obvious, and is, perhaps, better illustrated by reference to the Tarrawingee Flux Company in its relation to the
Broken Mill mines. This property is exceptionally well situated for most economical working, &c., inasmuch as it
is only twenty chains from the Mount Lyell Company’s railway, and a tramway can be made to the line at a very
nominal cost. The Mount Lyell Company are prepared to take any quantity of flux of this description, and the
b nefit d'Tived by this company in supplying flux to the Mount Lyell mine in this manner is very great, as it entirely
obviates the necessity of the erection of crushing plant and other costly appliances, with their attendant expenses,
and, a > will be seen by Mr. G. D. Gibson’s report, the Mount Lyell Company are prepared to purchase auriferous quartz
on the au; of its GOLD CONTENTS, and, under these circumstances, a very small percentage of gold would enable
this company to pay regular dividends. The Tarrawingee Flux Company have paid 37 dividends, amounting in the
aggregate to ill(i.),0 10 (one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling). It will also be seen by the appended reports
that no costly machinery will be required, as there is ample water-power available for all purposes, thus reducing the
cost of working the mine an 1 raising the quartz to a minimum. Apart from the special profits to be derived from its
connection with the Mount Lyell mine, it will be seen by the appended paragraph from the Hobart Mkrcury that if
taken as a gold-mine and worked in the ordinary way it would be a good investment, and more especially on taking
i ito account that it can be worked entirely by water-power. The amount, viz., J 52400 net, to be placed to credit of
the company is ample, and it is not anticipated that the 10,000 shares held in reserve will require to be diposed of.
The vendors, as showing their bona-fides and confidence in the property, have applied for 3000 out of the 30,000
shares now olfered to the public. These shares are well worthy of the special attention of all SHAREHOLDERS in the
MOUNT LYELL MINE, as the benefit derived by them from a company so closely situated to the smelters and being
m a position to supply golden flux of this nature is very great. From reports made by Mr. G. D. Gibson, M.A.1.M.E.,
and Mr. Colin McDonald, it will be seen that a good deal of work has already been done, and it only now requires a
shaft to be sunk to raise the quartz.
EXTRACT from REPORT by G. D. GIBSON, Esq., M.A.I.M.E.
Taking a dishful of lode stuff from up and down the face, I found, on panning it off, that the clay and fines,
separate from the rubble, gave a fair prospect of fine gold, as also did the rubble after being roughly pounded and
washed, only that the gold was heavier. Combined, the result may be considered highly satisfactory, especially as a
good deal of gold would, no doubt, be contained in the coarser tailings and fragments rejected. Another sample dish
taken from the crosscut gave very similar results, but in this case the quartz was more solid, and in some of the stones
the gold is apparent to the eye.
THE WHOLE WIDTH of the FORMATION is NOT LESS THAN EIGHT (8) FEET. There has arisen of late a
very special local reason why the development of even a low grade quartz lode in this district is become a matter of
importance. The Mount Lyell Mining Company require silica as a flux for the sulphide ores, and are prepared to pur-
chase auriferous quartz on the value of its gold contents—the gold being of value to them on account of enriching
the bullion and the quartz as flux. Now, should this property develop a sufficiently large body of quartz, even though
it be poor in quality, it will be placed in a particularly fortunate position owing to its close proximity to the Mount
Lyell Co.’s railway, which runs within 20 chains of the southern boundary, from which point an easy connection can
be made on a falling gradient, and the stone delivered directly into the company’s trucks, the expense of carriage being
thus practically nil. It is rarely that owners of gold-mines meet with such a happy method of disposing of their
quartz, all the difficulties and anxieties of treatment being thus at once disposed of. Apart from these special con-
siderations, the merits of the property itself quite justify the expenditure of capital in its exploitation and develop-
ment, while with the above advantages added it does the more so.
EXTRACT from REPORT of Mr. COLIN M'DONALD, Mine Manager. - . *
A considerable amount of work has been done on the property. A drive has been put into the hill 170 ft., and
crosscut 60ft. At 110 ft. in the drive the reef was struck, showing a good body of stone carrying gold. A winze has
been sunk 20ft., some very fine specimens of gold-bearing stone being obtained. The facilities for working the mine
are exceptional. Having secured the right of a permanent supply of water, it would only necessitate the cutting of a
race a few chains to bring it to the machinery-site at a very small cost. A good supply of suitable timber for mining
purposes is on the property. The mine is within 20 chains of the Mount Lyell railway, and a "tramway with a good
grade could be put in at a trifling cost. In conclusion, I may state that I have every confidence in the mine proving a
good investment.
PARAGRAPH from the “ HOBART MERCURY,” Aug. 7, 1896.
We have received particulars of assays made by Officer and Co, of quartz taken from a claim situate within 20
chains of the Mount Lyell Company’s railway. The discovery of this quartz is considered to be very important, as the
Mount Lyell Company require silica as a flux for their sulphide ores, and it is understood that the company will be
prepared to purchase the quartz on the value of the gold contents. The assays were of quantities of quartz treated
with a pestle and mortar, and are as follows No. 1,360 z. lldwt. 17.6 gr. of gold per ton ; No. 2,590 z. Odwt. 12.8 gr.
of gold per ton ; No. 3, 19dwt. 14.4 gr. per ton ; No. 4,19 gr per ton ; No. 6, 16dwt. 17.4 gr. per ton ; No. 6, lOoz. 12dwt.
12.8 gr. per ton ; No. 7,17 oz. 16dwt. 21.7 gr. per ton.
P.S. —Above tests have been made from stone taken from the mine since Mr. Gibson’s report was written on this
property. Tests 1,2, 3 and 7 were from stone showing gold. Tests 4,5, and 6 were from stone NOT showing gold.

THIS Company is being formed to acquire Gold Mining Lease No. 474 x, comprising 24 acres, and
situated near the Red Lake, 13 miles E.N.E. of White Feather, and North of and adjoining the
well-known General Gordon Extended Mine.
The property has been inspected by Mr. G. R. Fearby, M.E., and Captain Glass, Manager of the
General Gordon Mine, and their reports are appended.
According to these reports the lode formation is identical with that of the General Gordon, and
outcrops on the property ; the parallel formation in the West Block of the General Gordon Extended
Gold Mining Company is continued into the General Gordon Junction ; two blocks to the South-West
there is a formation PROVED TO BE 100 FEET WIDE, and this passes through the centre of the
General Gordon Junction. The formation of these lodes is a highly ferruginous chlorite schist, con-
taining numerous quartz leaders carrying gold.
The Red Lake is believed to have a permanent supply of water in the driest seasons suitable for
milling and reachable in easy sinking. At present the lake is a vast sheet of water many miles in
length, and of an average depth of about six feet. There is abundance of mining timber, and the
question of transport of machinery and mine supplies is largely answered by the fact that the mine is
within 25 miles of Kalgoorlie, the present terminus of the railway.
<£6250 will be placed to the credit of the working capital, less brokerage and flotation expenses.
An Agreement dated the sth day of August, 1896, has been signed between Randolph Bedford, of
Adelaide, and William Arthur Kingsborough on behalf of the proposed Company, and can be inspected
at the Solicitors’ Offices, Pirie Street, Adelaide.
Upon the formation of the Company a meeting of the allottees of shares will be held for the pur-
pose of passing the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and for the Eleotion of Directors, etc.
Dated at Adelaide this sth day of August, 1896.
Report by Mr. G- R. Fearby, M.E.
Received by Telegram, 6th July, 1896.
“ Have inspected block 474, of 24 acres, known as the General Gordon Junction. The mine
adjoins the General Gordon Extended on the north and the Gordon Consols on the east.
“ The position is well pegged—THßEE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YARDS ON THE
COURSE OF THE LODE. Property also contains portion of General Gordon main lode. Develop-
ments are costeen pits and trenchings. In two costeens gold found, formation assaying loz. to the
ton. Now sinking a shaft in north-east corner of block on the main lode, not yet sufficiently deep.
“Two blocks south-west there is a LODE 100 FEET WIDE; good prospects. The outcrop
of this lode is in your direction, AND PASSES THROUGH ABOUT THE CENTRE OF TOUR
PROPERTY.
“ I consider the PROPERTY A VERY VALUABLE ONE r well worthy further development.
Abundance of water and timber.”
Report by (Japt. Glass, Mine Manager of the General Gordon Gold-mining Go.
Received by Wire, August 4, 1896.
“ Acting under instructions I have visited and carefully examined the mine known as the General
Gordon Junction, and beg to submit my report on same.
“ The area of the property is 24 acres, and the number of lease 474. The property is situated
west of and adjoining the General Gordon Consols, with the General Gordon Extended (block 2394 e)
adjoining on the southern boundary.
“ On the property No. 1 shaft has been sunk to a depth of 38ft., and meeting the water your
manager decided to open out and drive to intersect the lode. This drive will require to go 30ft.
further to cut the lode formation now showing on the surface. The drive is now in 22ft. south-west.
Another crosscut was put in north-west and suspended at a distance of 12ft. The labor is now beiijg ;
mostly used in pushing the south-west drive to cut the lode. This FORMATION OUTCROPS ON
THE SURFACE AND GIVES GOOD PROSPECTS BY DOLLYING.
“ No. 2 Shaft has been sunk to a depth of thirty-five feet, about one and a-half chains west of No.
1 Shaft. There is here a SECOND LODE FORMATION, six feet wide, CARRYING GOOD
GOLD.
“ A Costeen has been opened some 3 chains in length which CLEARLY SHOWS TWO LODE
FORMATIONS RUNNING PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND GOLD IS BEING
OBTAINED IN BOTH.
“ In my opinion, if this Costeen was extended east and west, other lodes would be met with, the
whole of the block being exceptionally favorable.
“THE GENERAL GORDON JUNCTION IS IN A DIRECT LINE WITH THE
GENERAL GORDON ; the strike of lode being south-east and north-west. Like the other mines in
the neighborhood, you have everything necessary for economical mining—water and an unlimited
supply of timber.
“ In concluding this report, I can CONFIDENTLY RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY as a
SOUND MINING VENTURE.”
(Signed) WM. GLASS, Manager General Gordon Mine.

Osborne,' OaneO
& Co., London, W.
He was a leading member of the church,
and was in love with a sweet little girl who sang
in the choir and had a class at Sunday-school.
His love was returned. He had not always been
a good young man. There was a time when he
sowed his “ wild oats,” and on one occasion in too
prolific soil, which cost him 7s. 6d. a week. As he
gazed on the innocent little face he made up his
mind to tell her of his wickedness in the past,
and ask her forgiveness. When he told his story
she readily forgave him, saying she knew it was
the girl’s fault. “ Oh, darling,” he cried I could
be thoroughly happy but for the hole that 7s. ocl.
makes in my income.” “Never mind, dear, she
said, with a sweet little blush, “ I have an income
of 7s. 6d. a week.”
How Providence watches over the drunk.
The other day, at Heathcote (Vic.), a miner much
disguised in liquor started for home on a baturday
night, and wasn’t heard of again until late on
Tuesday. Most people were beginning to assume
that he had spontaneously combusted on the road,
and that his boots had blown away, till he was
found hollering for assistance at the bottom of a
40-foot shaft. This shows how the wind of
adversity is tempered to the shorn drunk. He
dropped 13 yards, and landed in a beery heap
without the slightest injury. There didn t happen
to be Bft. of mud at the bottom of that particular
shaft. There was no snake there. He didn t fall
on two dead sheep and die a horrible death through
blood-poisoning and effluvia. The shaft was old
and rotten, but it didn’t cave in with tne shock of
his sudden arrival. He didn’t die of thirst, for
rain came on and a thin stream trickled down for
drinking purposes. Also, he didn’t even get
rheumatism, and he was accidentally discovered
in three days,, whereas a sober, upright citizen
would probably not have been found for three
months.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Buck: “I call it our tight place because
there were three of us, riding across country to a
party at a neighbouring station. We were all
dressed in store clothes and each had a boiled
shirt. It had been threatening ram all the
morning, but we expected to reach the homestead
before it came. But, ere half the journey was
over, the rain began to fall in the heavy drops
that foretell a big shower. The genius of the
party proposed that we make for a certain hollow
tree, strip and unsaddle, plant the clothes, and
stand the shower out, holding the prads, and,
when it was all over, pull out the dry clothes. This
brilliant idea was carried out to the letter, to. the
accompaniment of heavy thunder and lightning.
Then, holding the horses, we awaited the end of
the storm under the shelter of the big gum. But
presently it started to hail, and, ere you could say
Bulletin, down it came in torrents. The homes
reared and plunged with the sting of the big
stones, and dragged us all out in bare pelts from
the shelter of the tree. Then— the proverbial cat
on hot bricks couldn’t have got a place with us.
The tree was soon a full hundred yards away, and
that tree was the only shelter for half a mile
or more. Try our hardest we couldn’t get
the horses to it. Suddenly—crack !—light
ning, struck the tree, and down it came in a
million pieces with a crash lost in the deafening
peal of thunder. Thoughts of what might have
happened made us white and speechless; hut the
restless prads soon brought us to our senses. We
were covered from head to foot with red and blue
spots —walking plum-duffs. When the storm
eased down, stiff and sore, we waded through the
d4bris, and fished out of the stump of that old
gum the soddened and blackened mass which was
once our clothes. The saddles were done for.
We didn’t go to that party.”

TO MINING COMPANIES, BATTERY OWNERS
AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha’s
_Patent Battery Plates,
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with. The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased by fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

no ornithologist is responsible for the bush saying
that a crow’s nest has never been found ? In Tas-
mania, at least, they are as commonly found as
the magpie’s, though they certainly choose trees
more difficult of access. The Horton College boys
always had full clutches of crows’ eggs in their col-
lections. Perhaps there is a confusion of crow
with black cockatoo —that has always been the
roc’s egg amongst collectors.— Van Demon.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ You must do a snug business here, Mrs.
Firking,” said the customer, helping himself
liberally to the counter-lunch. “ It’s a good idea
of yours starting the bar-lunch in the suburbs,
same as in the city. It’ll make business.”
“Yes,” replied Mrs. Firking. “There ain’t
much in it, though, when all’s said and done.”
“Ah !” genially laughed her patron, “that’s
always the way with business-people—never satis-
fied even when they’re coining money.”
“ Coining money—God help us ! ” murmured
the landlady under her breath. Then, smiling :
“ I see you know all about it, Mr. Spencer; I
wonder you don’t go in for a pub. yourself.”
And as he placed a threepenny-piece on the
counter as payment for his beer and his luncheon,
he said he had thought about it. It wasn’t so
difficult, was it, to start with a brewer’s aid ?
“ As easy as winking,” rejoined Mrs. Firking.
* * * *
He was her twentieth caller, was Spencer,
and it was already half-past eleven o’clock. Six
shillings and sixpence in the till, and a shilling’s-
worth of food gone from the bar-lunch. Then
there was big Murphy, and Sam the butcher, and
little Johnson, the barber from across the road.
They would all come in presently for their three-
penny beers—long ones—and each would make a
heavy meal.
“Dashed good institooshun, this, ain’t it?” she
had heard Johnson say. “ I used to pay a bob
for my dinner before without the drink, and now
I gets pretty well as good a feed and the beer
thrown in for a thrum ! ” Most of her customers
thought with Johnson. There was one blessing,
however. After the men had picked over the
lunch-spread, she could always get enough for a
meal for herself and the girl out of the fragments.
Half-past eleven, and about twelve-fifteen the
traveller of the great brewery would drop in. He
would want some money on account, that was
certain, and all she could muster was three-pound-
ten—a mere drop in the bucket of her indebted-
ness. Then there was the overdue account of the
one wine and spirit merchant with which the
brewery would allow her to deal. He would be
pressing her next week—and the rate-collector
was due for calling again also—and then the grocer
was snarling, and the children’s school-fees.
Thank heaven ! the good sisters at least would
wait, if no one else would ; though even it was
difficult to make them and Father Clancy under-
stand that she, the landlady of the snug little
public, doing such a nice corner-trade, and with
two lodges meeting in her house, was not paying
her way, and could not contribute to this school
fund or that church subscription.
Twelve-fifteen —and the natty sulky of the great
brewery’s representative drove up to the door.
“Mornin’, Mrs. Firkin’, how’s trade- got some-
thing for me, I hope. I see the painters are put-
ting an advertisement on your back wall. Who’s
it for ? ”
“The Dailv squelcher has offered me four
pounds a year ”
“Oh, you can’t do that, Mrs. Firking, without
the firm’s permission. I don’t know how I came
to overlook it —of course, I see"how it catches the
eyes of the train people We must have our own
name up there.”
“But,” in desperation, exclaimed Mrs. Firking,
“ the firm won’t pay four pounds a year for its
use. And you’ve got the front, and the side-walls,
and the bare windows now ! ”
“Oh, that’s all in the agreement, you know.
However, I’ll tell you what we’ll do : we ll pay the
sign-writer for his lost time. There, that’s
fair ; now, isn’t it ? And now, what cash are
you going to favor me with to-day? ’Twon’t
break the sulky down, I hope ? ”
Mrs. Firking smiled as in duty bound at this
pleasantry, and tendered three-pounds-ten. “ It’s
all I have ; every penny. ”
The commercial’s jocularity dropped to the point
of vanishment.
“ That all ? Look hete, Mrs. F. ; that won’t do,
you know. I’ll get sacked over your account yet.
Why, you must be letting the trade go away to
nothing ! And we hear you’re getting behind with
your tradesmen, and the rent-account is getting
into arrears, too. Come, now, you must send me
out at least a fiver—not a penny less. If you can’t
—well, I’m really afraid the firm will have to come
down on you. And on me, too. They’ll say I
have been too lenient.”
“I can’t give you more.” The woman was
within an inch of tears.
The commercial, doing but true service to his
masters, became insistent to the verge of brutality.
He must have five pounds, or
Mrs. Firking went up-stairs, and, returning,
threw down another sovereign. “ There ! take
that from my little ones’ money-box. No, you
needn’t look as if I gave it them. It’s a schnapps-
coupon pound. God knows, nothing much in luck
comes in my way now, and the children hadn’t
had a shilling in their box for months. ”
“ Four-pound-ten,” said the commercial, un-
moved. “ Ten shillings more, please, Mrs. F.”
“ I have nothing more ! ” The woman was
sullen.
“ Oh, yes, you have ! You’ve got some tram-
tickets and stamps in that cigar-box, haven’t you ?
Make up five bob more with them, and I’ll take
that bottle of M'Sandy’s whisky there for the
balance. Is the capsule sound ?
“That’s the only bottle of good whisky I have
unopened in the place. The stuff you send ’ll get
me into trouble some day. Besides, that bottle
cost me six-and-three, and you’d only give me
equal to five shillin’. And I ain’t paid for it yet,
neither.”
Protest notwithstanding she handed the bottle
down at last. Giving her a receipt, by cash and
sundries, for the five pounds, he fell back into the
persuasive.
“Now, look here, Mrs. Firking, I think, and
the firm think, you’re not cut out for this business.
You owe us a matter of five hundred pounds—
that’s three hundred of the original purchase and
interest and current account since. Hadn’t you
better give it up ? You see the trade’s going to
the dogs.”
“ And what’ll I do for the two hundred I gave
you to come in?” moaned the woman. “All I
and the children had in the world ! ”
“ Oh, well, that’s gone, you know. At the worst
you know you’ve had your living out of the hotel
for 15 months, and that’s something.”
“ What of all my hard work, and the worry, and
the long hours ? Ain’t they worth my bite and
sup ? ”
“Anyhow, the firm know a man who’s ready to
come in. Now, if you’ll go out without any fuss
I’m authorised to say they’ll let off, say, half of
the five hundred. And that’s treating you real
liberal.”
“ And what of my other creditors —not much
’tis I owe besides the brewery—what am I to do
for a home for my children ? ”
“That’s no concern of the firm’s, Mrs. P. You
came into the business open-eyed ’
“ God forgive you the lie ! ” Then the woman
broke down.
And a fortnight later an advt. appeared in
the Squelcher of another “ Eligible hotel property.
Suburb, snug bar trade, two lodges meeting in
rooms. Ingoing, J 260 0; cash, =£2so, easy terms

Tied houses are so-called because they are tied
round some poor devil’s neok.
The Dowager Duchess of Newcastle re-
sides in a small house at Whitechapel, and devotes
herself to charitable work among the poorest
Catholic members of the “ submerged tenth.” A
theme for any moralist who knows anything about
the lady’s two dead husbands and the life she led
between them. Poor old Duoh. ! —not that she is
very old, either.
Recent mention of a workman being cast
into the molten metal of one of the Murray bridge
iron supports, recalls a somewhat similar occur-
rence, when the N.S.W. Blue-Mountain Zigzag
was being built. Two navvies were undermining
the side of a hill there to cause a slip, when the
whole mass came down on them. The stuff
fell just where it was wanted, so the men were not
dug out; and every train that passes rumbles a
requiem for their souls.
A great oratorical break was lately made
at a high-toned Sydney function. The eloquent
responder, mounted on old sherry—“the winged
horse of Parnassus that hurries the bard to the
skies” —beamed around him, and exclaimed : “If
the sons and daughters of our first families were
whipped naked down Pitt-street, as their ancestors
were ! ” But he was docile, and accepted the
tug from behind, so that very few are competed to
say they heard that politician make a fool of
himself.
Up Youlahmine way, recently, the “boys ”
stuck up a Syrian hawker for all he had. After-
jtrds, the “ Assyrian came down like a wolf on
fold ” and laid an information. But their
pals squared it privately with the foreigner for a
tenner, so, when the case came on, nothing could
be dragged out of him but “ me don’t know, no
understand.” The result was he got 48 hours for
“contimpt.” But the story, unluckily for the
man from Syria, does not end just here. When
released he discovered, by experiment, that the
tenner was “cronk”—it nearly got him run in
again.
A report mentions that on the Great
M'Kinley Day in ’Murka, the Chief M'Kinley
Boss, amid the general orgies, didn’t know how he
went to bed —“ whether he was afoot or on horse-
back.” Let Envy speak :
“Upon thy belly shalt thou go!” I'he
abject flunkeyism of the middle-class Briton was
never better exemplified than by the fact that he
wouldn’t have read a line of Blackmore’s “ Lorna
Doone ” if a certain edition of the work hadn t
happened to coincide with the Lorne-Louise mar-
riage ; whereupon—supposing in “Lorna” somi
reference to “Lome” —the collective British
Jeames rushed that is, crawled —for the book,
and financially “made” it.
Dear Bulletin, —Does the bush brutalise
women? Outside a pub., on the borders of tha
Never-Never, an unfortunate greyhound had been
run over, but managed to crawl to where two fine
strapping damsels sat. The poor dog was in a soul-
stirring state, yelping piteously in its agony, and
should have cudgelled up sympathy in the most
callous heart. But the women merely looked on
awhile as interested spectators, and then “shooed
the tortured brute from off the premises, laughing
over the awkward movements displayed by its
broken limbs. They laughed—and I now know
what it is to hear hell in a laugh. —A Disgusted
Swagger.
Dear Bulletin, — Be your paragraphist
who sleeps best without pillows, a not-sufficiently-
noted phase of the insomnia-question is that,
except in a very general sense, there is no specific
remedy for this tremendous handicap upon mental
efficiency. Thus while one man sleeps upon coffee
and keeps awake upon tea, another exactly re-
verses these conditions. Also, while a moderate
amount of liquor will send A off and keep B
broad-awake, a heavy dose of the same may make
of A a log and of B a bundle of tingling sensibili-
ties. You might sleep best with much cold, I
with much heat, and yet a third be wakeful only
under either extreme. The only certain cure for
insomnia would be a more or less complete nervous
rehabilitation. Combine with a high degree of
nervous stability a tolerable exemption from dis-
tractions, and position will make little difference—
sleep will follow a given period of wakefulness as
inevitably as the night the day. The Chinaman —
who has no discoverable nerves—can slumber
peacefully standing on his head, with his legs tied
round his neck ! — Speculum.
Dear Bulletin, — Apropos Mark Twain’s
theory of mental telegraphy. I heard a piece of
news the other day, supposed to be secret, and,
following the usual rule in such cases, I communi-
cated it to a friend in Sydney, requesting him (as
is also usual) to keep it to himself, and I wound
up my letter with “ mum’s the word.” Two days
later I received a letter from my Sydney friend
informing me of the same bit of news, and,
stranger still, he ended his letter with the same
exhortation to be silent. The two letters had
crossed, and, on comparing notes, we found that
both were written and both were received on the
same days. Again: having nothing to do one
Saturday afternoon, I determined to telephone a
friend and ask him to ride with me to the race-
course. But ere I had time to ask to be connected
with my friend’s hotel I heard a ring at the
’phone, and, on answering it, found it to be from
the friend in question, who proceeded to ask me
the very same thing that I was about to ask him.
What made it all the more curious wa3 that
neither of us had been to the racecourse for some
time, and had never ridden there together before,
and that the race-meeting was an off one, with no
special interest to either of us. Both these events
may have been only coincidences; but I prefer to
explain them by Mark Twain’s theory.—Specta-
tor

Job Fryer,
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“No, there ain’t much goes on in our
street as I don’t know on. I’ve got ’em all set, I
have. I know their histries and fakements, most
of ’em, a sight better nor they know theirselves.
They can’t flummox me ! ”
That explained it. I had often, since I came to
live in “our street,” wondered why this fat,
pasty-faced Job Pryer, of the large inquisitorial
nose, and the stealthy, scrutinising eyes, haunted
a seat in one corner of his verandah —haunted it
every day and all day, and at varied hours of the
night. While a vestige of daylight remained he
deserted his post only to snatch urgent interview's
with his food, frequently returning with his
mouth full and hunks of hot pudding in both
hands. If anyone passed while he was thus laden,
ho became so absorbed in his or her movements
that he would stoke and scald his ample mouth
with the pudding aforesaid. His sentry-box, so
to speak, commanded a view of the terrace he re-
sided in, the terrace on the opposite side of the
way, and, indeed, of the entire street. He owned
his own house and four others in our street. He
- toiled not, neither did he spin. He collected his
vrents and the scandal, veracious or otherwise—
“not seldom otherwise—of our streets for a living.
* ♦ * *
Job Pryer was upwards of 50, and far
from pretty. He had a yellow, greasy, creased
look about him, as if he had been a long time
folded up on a pawnbroker’s shelf. How he capti-
vated and succeeded in marrying his handsome
young wife is a problem I have never solved. She
was exceedingly nice to look at, with lovely dark
eyes and hair, pearly teeth, pouting red lips, and
a soul - satisfying figure. But she was more
demure than the demurest old-time Quakeress,
more nun-like than the devoutest nun. Numbers
of bold, bad young men in our street, arrayed in
blue serge suits, straw hats, and garden-beds in
their buttonholes, cast killing glances at Mrs.
Pryer, or, with the idea of “breaking her up,”
extended their chests and displayed their purple
and fine linen to her gaze as they paraded before
the window at which she often sat. But no
shadow of recognition, let alone encouragement,
escaped those pellucid, modest eyes. She
gazed over them, past them, as one who essays to
penetrate the dim vistas of eternity. She very
seldom went out. Job did not believe in “wimmin
gaddin’all over the bloomin’ shop.” He told me
so. “I’ve seen too much of that in our street,”
he said; “not that there’s any fear of her. I
could trust her with a ’ole regiment, and the
colonel thrown in. Blesh yer ! she’s been brought
up proper, she ’as—religious and moral, and all
that kind of think. Never wants to go out flyin’
round, she don’t; too fond of ’er ’ome and dooty
and old man ! ”
* * * *
“ Bub, good lor ! ” he continued, “ there’s
donahs in our very street, as they calls respectable,
reg’lar out-and-outers, and butter wouldn’t melt
in their mouths. Oh, no ! There’s a little woman
now as lives three doors from you, on your right;
’usband’s a commercial, he is. Gomes ’ome unex-
pected Friday night fortnight and finds a young
chap there. Folks ’bout here say as ’twas her
brother. Brother, me heye. I knows a ’ang’d
sight better. But her ’usband, poor fool, comes
out with him, friendly and laughin’, at 25 to 11,
by my watch, and they goes to the pub. together.
Nice game she carries on.”
I said I was sorry for that.
“Did ye ’ear the flamin’ row as there was at
number seven on Wednesday night—or rather
Thursday morning ?”
“ I didn’t hear any particular disturbance, only
Mr. Brown knocking two or three times. He’d
been to his lodge and forgot to take his latch-key,
and they were all asleep.”
“ Been to his lodge ! Bah ! Been to a lodge
with a chimley-pot to it. Been to the pub.,
a-flirtin’ with that ikey barmaid! That’s where
he’d been, and that’s where half the men in our
street pass their ev’nin’s. And why did they keep
him knockin’ ‘t Because someone ’ad to be let out
of the back door, that’s why. There’s nothin’ as
escapes Job Pryer.”
Just then a tall, slim, dignified lady, my next-
door neighbor, passed.
“Looks meek an’ mild an’sankeyfied, don’t she
now? Know where she’s agoin’? No? Well,
she’s agoin’ to buy a bottle of square-face gin, and
she’ll soak it to-night to her own cheek. Buys
four bottles a week, an’ ’er ’usban’ in theguv’ment
hemploy, ’oldin’ his ’ed ’igh, I can tell you. No,
there’s no carryin’s on in our street as I don’t
know—not one.”
Here Mr. Jones’ front door was opened, and
Mr. and Mrs. Jones—probably the most truly
affectionate and irreproachable couple in Sydney—
came down the steps.
“ Look at them! Just look at ’em ! Turtle-
doves, people calls’em. An’they fights like cat
and dog. Jones, he’s just got rid of a swollen
face, where she busted him in the jaw las’ Tuesday
week. ”
“ Oh, come, Mr. Pryer, that was toothache. I
went with Mr. Jones to the dentist while he had
the tooth drawn.”
“ Toothache ! I daresay, with your toothache !
They went to the thayatre Monday night, an’ he
kep’ lookin’ at a girl in the dress-succle. I ’eard
’em talkin’ about it as they passed my ’ouse.
Toothache ! Broom-’andle ache, more like ! ”
* * * *
Mr. Pryer had no family and very few
visitors. “ I don’t want folks a-foolin’ round my
’ouse, and a-pokin’ their noses into what don’t
consarn ’em,” he explained. An elderly hay bag
or two visited Mrs. Pryer once in a way. But
Job had a particular crony whom he always wel-
comed warmly —a mahogany-faced party of 65 at
least, whose voluminous epigastric protuberance
was cased in white waistcoat and festooned with
a watch-chain which looked like linked sausages of
precious metal. This patriarch walked slowly and
ponderously, and owned a peculiarly massive
double chin and a remarkably libidinous and roll-
ing eye.
“ One of the best informedest an’ most genteel-
est old blokes in .Sydney, is Mr. Sain Tucker,”
said Job to me. “ Been heverywheres and seen
hevery think, and that free-’earted as never was.
Got the mopuses, too, and terraces, ’as Tucker.
There’s only one think agen him—he can’t abide
the female sect —reg’lar woman-’ater, that’s what
he is ; he told me so. He’s just civil, so’s you can
say civil, to my missus. ‘1 looks on her,’ he says
to me, ‘ as a chit of a girl—a mere child,’ he says.
She’ates him. Me and she’s ’ad words about it
more than oncet; only I up and makes her be civil
to him when he comes to the ’ouse. I’m a man as
rules royal in my own ’ome, I can tell you,
mister.”
* Jf * *
Landlord Pryer became a tritie oppressive.
He eternally bailed me up as I passed, to favor
me with the more than criminal biographies of the
inhabitants—male, female, adult, and juvenile—of
our street. If I had had faith, even as a grain of
mustard-seed, in Job and his biographies, I must
have concluded that I had pitched my tent in the
most abandoned and infamous locality in all
Sydney. Moreover, I had the consolation of
knowing, through both the milkman and baker,
that Job Pryer represented me as being a pecu-
liarly virulent type of ruffian. He gave me to un-
derstand that there were not more than three
chaste females—of whom Mrs. Pryer was un-
doubtedly one, and her nice-looking servant.
Susan, was another —and only two honest men—
and Mr. Pryer was one of these —in our street.
“ It takes me to cipher ’em up,” he remarked.
“Talk about a heye like a ’awk ; I’ve got the
’awk heye, if you like. I’d a made a prime police-
man, or one of these ’ere private liinquiries, I
would.”
* * * *
There was something in connection with
the Pryer manage which gave me pain: On several
occasions—when Pryer and Tucker, in company,
had left the former’s house to adjourn to the
neighboring pub., where Pryer supplemented the
information he gathered in our street —I noticed
Tucker lag behind his host and slyly wave signs or
signals towards that host’s house. More than once
I saw a female, whose face I could not distinguish,
respond to the signals. Now, Pryer’s domestic,
Susan, Was a remarkably plump and well-favored
young person ; but if, as seemed probable, that
“reg’lar woman-’ater,” Tucker, was carrying-on
with the chaste Susan, it certainly seemed to me
that Job was mistaken, both in his jidus Achates
and his modest serving-maid. A friend to whom
I mentioned the matter pointed out, however, that
senile old gentlemen frequently affect towards
young females a manner at once playful and pater-
nal. That might be ; still I failed to understand
why the venerable Tucker invariably sneaked be-
hind Job’s back to bestow fatherly, or grand-
fatherly, salutation upon Susan.
* * * *
One evening I met Job a few hundred
yards from his own house, his face turned city-
wards. “I’m a hoddfellow,” he explained, “an’
I attends oncet a month, reg’lar, to pay my book
up. Sha’n’t be ’ome till eleven. The missis ain’t
well, and she’s gone to bed. Susan’s gone to a
prayer-meeting. Ain’t religious myself, but re-
ligion’s good for females. Talkin’ about that, I’ve
a story to tell you ’bout a woman in our street an’
her parson—my heyes, that is a story, that is ;
Tell you to-morrow, when you’re goin' in to town.
No time now.”
As I passed on, he shouted after me—“ They
can’t flummox me —nothin’ hescapes my heye ! ”
* * * *
I met someone else after this, and it was
quite half-an-hour before I arrived in our street.
When I came to Pryer’s house, it struck me as
strange that the lower room should be lighted,
for Job had a thrifty mind and wasted not gas,
and Mrs. Job had, so her husband had said, gone
to bed. The window was open. The blinds were
up. They had evidently been left up in error.
The lower room is really two rooms divided by
folding doors. Those doors were partially open,
and the light was burning in the back room.
There were only two persons present—Mrs. Pryer
and—“ the best informdest an’ most genteelest old
bloke in Sydney.” The former, looking ravish-
ingly beautiful, though not painfully demure,
wore a charming toilette of a loose and open
nature. The latter embraced and kissed the lady
with an energy somewhat remarkable in so pat-
riarchal a person.
* • * *
Even as I gazed, shocked and astounded
by so much treachery, I heard, without hearing, a
strident voice quite close to me say, “ Well, good
night; I forgot my book. I’ve come back for it.
I shall be late. I’ll tell you that yarn ter morrow.
Ive got ’em set. Nothin’ hescapes me ! ”
• * * *
Then there was an awful, a stentorian, an
apoplectic breathing at my left ear, and suddenly
someone fell in a heap at my feet, grabbing wildly
for the railings. I called a warning through the
window, stooped, and picked up—Job Fryer !
J. EVISON.
N.S.AV. Foreign-trade Government pro-
poses to be willing to give local manufacturers
preference over foreign manufacturers and im-
porters of foreign goods in respect of Government'
tenders. Commendable from a Protectionist
viewpoint, but rank heresy to the doctrine of
Freetrade, and idolatrous rebellion against the
importing god.
“In another hundred years the average
Australian will be a tall, coarse, strong-jawed,,
greedy, pushing, talented man, excelling in swim-
ming and horsemanship. His religion will be a
form of Presbyterianism, his national policy a
democracy tempered by the rate of exchange.
His wife will be a thin, narrow woman very fond
of dress and idleness, caring little for her children,
and without sufficient brain-power to sin with
zest.”— Marcus Clarke.
“At present,” says an English paper,
“ the skins of Australian kangaroos are much
prized ; a skin is worth more than an average
sheep—carcase, wool and all—for which reason
squatters are giving up sheep-farming for kangaroo
raising.” Yes, and bunyips are now being grown
in millions for their ivory tails, which are worth
more than a 10001 b. bullock, and the production of
emu’s milk has in five years increased 8000 per
cent. It is now the staple basis of Victorian
cheese.
Tobacco lias got to go in several American
universities. Boston university is returning fees
and giving clearance tickets to all students who
will not abjure “My Lady Nicotine.” Ohio
Wesleyan and other universities propose to do the
same next year. Statistics given are curious. In
1801, of a class of 147 at Yale, 77 non-smokers,
excelled 70 smokers in increase of weight by 10'4
per cent , of height by 24 per cent., of chest-girth
by 26 '7 per cent. At Amherst College the in-
crease-superiority of non-users of tobacco in any
form was for the four years’course—weight, 24 per
cent., height, 37 per cent., chest-girth, 42 percent.
At both Yale and Amhurst non-smokers showed
a superiority of increase in lung capacity of over
75 per cent. Unluckily the respective brains
couldn’t be measured.


“For
some years I was
quite out of health, and
took much medicine
which did me no good. I
was advised by a friend to
try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
which I did, taking a dozen
or more bottles before stop-
ping. The result was that I
felt so well and strong
that I, of course, think there is
no medicine equal to Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla, and I take great pains
to tell any suffering friend of it and
what it did for me.”—Mrs. L. A.
Murray, Kilbourn,Wis., Feb.11,i896.

The above are indeed weighty words, of great import and value to
thousands of pale-faced, languid men and women, now tired and worn out
with worry, overwork, and disease, and who would be made well and strong
by the use of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. Bead also the following interesting
testimony of a prominent athlete:
627 Bourkb St., Surry Hills, Sydney,
New South Wales, June 21, 1898.
“After being a victim to Typhoid, Brain, and Rheumatic fevers, in 1892, my
system was left in a terrible condition. Besides being very weak, I had numerous
abscesses on the lower part of my back and spine, from which a great number of
pieces of bone were taken. As fast as an abscess would appear and was lanced
another would form. I was treated at two different hospitals without success. The
surgeons in attendance informed me that I was suffering from blood poison. The
abscesses continued to appear, and I was never without pain, till six months ago I
was induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. When I had taken the first bottle I found
an improvement, and .after finishing twelve bottles to-day I feel as well as ever I did
in my life; the abscesses have ceased to come, the old ones are all healed, and my
health is splendid. Before I used the Sarsaparilla I weighed 154 lbs., and now, after
using a dozen bottles, my weight is 200 lbs., which is a sure sign that I have been
taking the Champion Blood-Purifier of the world.”— George W. Walker, “Jumbo,”
