The Curfew Still Tolls From
Ripon’s Guardian Tower
jO IPON, standing beside the River Ure,
in Yorkshire, claims historical asso-
ciations which extend far beyond the
year a.d. 886, when certain self-governing
privileges were conferred upon the small
community which clustered around the
early monastic church. Today it enjoys
full municipal favours as a cathedral city,
and is noted for its old-world charm and
the many ancient customs which still
survive. Here the past and the present
exist side by side, and here each evening
at nine o’clock the past is recalled by the
sounding of curfew. As the curfew bell
tolls in the cathedral tower a horn is
sounded just as it was done when Saxon
and Dane contended for mastery in
bygone days.
The blower of the horn is known as
the “Wakeman,” which was the Saxon
name for chief magistrate, whose duty
it was to appoint the blower. The Saxon
law provided that if any house was
robbed after horn-blowing until three or
four o’clock in the morning the Wake-
man had to make good the loss from
funds to which every householder con-
tributed. The Wakeman wears the tradi-
tional green coat and three-cornered hat
and blows the horn outside the Mayor’s
house and in the market place; a signal
which, in years gone by, meant that all
good citizens should retire to bed —a
signal which is now generally ignored.
The present cathedral stands upon a
site which was first occupied by a
religious house nearly thirteen centuries
ago, when St. Wilfrid established a
church there, the crypt of which still sur-
vives. At the east end of the crypt is a
narrow niche which tradition asserts was
used as a test for the virtuous, for only
they, it was said, were able to pass
through the aperture. Many architectural
styles are incorporated in the cathedral,
which was begun in the twelfth century
and enlarged in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. The chief feature of the
exterior is the thirteenth-century West
Front, built in the Early English style,
and is the only one of its kind in Britain.
Originally the twin towers were sur-
mounted by spires, but these were taken
down for safety in 1664 after the collapse
of the central spire.
The Lady Chapel within the cathedral
has been used for the last century as a
library, in which may be seen valuable
books, three of which were printed by
Caxton

THE HINTON BOOK.
Year after year on the “private-view”
days of art exhibitions in Sydney one
could see Howard Hinton making his
slow and monumental pilgrimage around
the pictures. He was the reverse of a
fierce and fire-eating Australian artist
who once explained to the present writer
how he had got as far as the door of the
Royal Art Society show and then stopped
~ f can tell at a glance the sort of stuff
they paint! Rubbish!”; and with a
sweep of his hand he threw some 200
painters out The Bulletin window.
That would never have done for Hin-
ton. There might have been something
really good in a corner ; as, in fact, at
that exhibition there was —a couple of
fine Lance Solomons. And then any
sincere painter, good, bad or indifferent,
loved and served art in his way, and
Hinton respected him for it, as he revered
the cause he served. So, silver-haired,
round-shouldered, pink-cheeked, sombre
in his clothes, he walked round the exhi-
bitions very gravely, carefully studying
every picture in turn, and, when his in-
terest was aroused, tapping the glass with
the knuckle of his forefinger in a gesture
which might have meant either approval
or admonishment, but which was, above
all, immensely serious. There was
something ritualistic about it; a mystery
was being performed.
The pictures he tapped most severely
went to Armidale Teachers’ College. As
time went on and you got to know his
taste you could guess, nine times out of
ten, which paintings he would select.
They would be the best; but the best in
a special way; not simply the most im-
portant paintings by the most important
artists —though often enough he bought
those —but the odd things of genuine
quality you find in every exhibition when
a minor artist makes a statement beyond
his normal powers, or when some un-
known painter first clearly announces the
promise he may or may not fulfil.
Picture after picture went to Armidale
in this way; at first Gruners, Hilders,
Streetons, Norman Lindsays ; then Elder-
shaw, Townshend, McNamara, a couple
of Dobells, a Drysdale, Lance Solomon,
A. J. Murch, George Lawrence; and
there, out of sight from Sydney but not
quite out of mind, safe from bombs,
revolution, loan to politicians and excur-
sions into the cellars of the National
Gallery, immortal but tantalisingly
remote, they still are. Except for a
memory of one or two exceptionally
lovely paintings and a vague impression
of a great bulk of Australian art lurking
somewhere up the country one could
never really be certain exactly what
Hinton bad done; how much was at
Armidale, how good it might be.
The answer to all that is the large,
handsome volume published as a
memorial by Angus and Robertson:
Howard Hinton, Patron of Art. Ninety
of Hinton’s paintings are reproduced in
this book, 22 in color ; there is a com-
plete catalogue of both the Armidale
pictures and Hinton’s gifts to (he N. S.
Wales Gallery, a total, excluding prints,
of 1149, of which 1027 are at Armidale ;
and there is a survey of the Armidale pic-
tures reprinted from an article John
Fountain wrote for The Bulletin at the
time of Hinton’s death in 1948: —
Inside the library (here are Streetons;
“Sydney Harbor from Sirius Cove," “The
Old Inn, Richmond" and “Gloucester
Buckets” There is also a magnificent
Heysen, “The Willow,” an oil, with the
willow leaning left and full of growth,
light and green. Something quilc unlike his
gum-tree paintings, yet with the same
majesty, and with the breadth and original
perception of his Central Australian land-
scapes, it can be compared only with
Gruner's “Pines.” Certainly it is impossible
fully to appreciate Heyscn’s work without
seeing (his painting....
Because the Australian National Gal-
leries have never made any serious
attempt to do what should be their first
duty, to acquire a fully representative
collection of Australian art —Melbourne
spends its thousands on Old Masters and
Sydney muddles complacently along with-
out any perceptible policy—it is tempt-
ing to assess Hinton’s Armidale pictures
as a national collection. That is not alto-
gether fair. It is a collection of the best
of the paintings that happened to come
before Hinton’s eyes.
Though he has Hans Heysen, Nora
Heysen and Max Ragless from South
Australia, Namatjira from the Centre,
Sturgess, Daryl Lindsay, Harold Herbert,
Blamire Young, Meldrum, Septimus
Power and Arnold Shore from Victoria,
Vida Lahey and Kenneth Macqueen from
Queensland, it is obvious from the cata-
logue that most of the painters, especially
the minor ones, are from New South
Wales: simply because Hinton could see
their work in Sydney. Again it is
obvious that, even in Sydney, Hinton’s
choice was to some extent limited by
what was available: to him at public
exhibitions.
But it is equally obvious from the cata-
logue that this is far more like a national
collection than anything else you could
find in Australia. The artists who chiefly
appealed to Hinton, and whose work was
readily available to him, were: Norman
Lindsay, of whose oils, watercolors,
pen-drawings and etchings Hinton gave
32 to Armidale as well as 18 to the
Sydney Gallery; Lionel Lindsay (33
etchings arid woodcuts at Armidale, 16
in Sydney); Gruner (13 at Armidale,
eight in Sydney); Streeton (15 at
Armidale, three in Sydney) ; Hilder (five
at Armidale, 14 in Sydney); Lambert
(eight at Armidale, eight in Sydney).
There are 14 Norman Carters (includ-
ing .a portrait of Hinton and a set of
stained-glass windows) at Armidale ; 16
Tom Garretts, 13 Hankes, 12 Adrian
Feints, 11 Margaret Coens, 13 Full-
woods, nine Hans Heysens, 10 Percy
Leasons, 12 Daryl Lindsays, 11 Sydney
Longs, 10 John D. Moores, nine G. V. F.
Manns. There are eight by B. E. Minns,
15 by A. J. Murch, 11 by Lance Solomon,
seven by Lloyd Rees, seven by Will
Ashton. Also James Cook seven, Ronald
Steuart six, G. K. Townshend 15, Wakelin
six, Unk White six, S. Ure Smith eight,
James Cook seven, Woodward Smith
seven, J. W. Maund five, Eric Wilson
four, Muir Auld five, Ted Scorfield five,
Howard Ashton seven. There are four
of Hinton’s Tom Robertses at Armidale
and one in Sydney ; five Blamire Youngs
at Armidale and two in Sydney ; and
Armidale has also four splendid
examples of Rayner Hoff’s sculpture.
Occasionally there are gaps in the col-
lection. There is, for instance, no Pen-
leigh Boyd at Armidale, though Hinton
gave one to the Sydney Gallery. There
is only one Longstaff at Armidale and
only one Meldrum. There is no Ivor
Hele, no Dargie. But on the other hand
you often come across good painters
whose names are not often enough re-
called these days: Percy Spence, for in-
stance, and J. Llewelyn Jones, both of
whom painted admirable small oils. And,
on the whole, there are remarkably few
worth-while painters, of the early period
or of today, not represented: and repre-
sented, often, at their best, because
Hinton watched the whole course of
their development. There is a Buvelot
(presented to Hinton for Armidale by
Julian Ashton); a Briefly ; a Conder ; a
Piguenit; E. Phillips Fox ; Will Dyson ;
Dattilo Rubbo; Roi de Mestre;
Margaret Preston; Mary Edwards ; Rah
Fizelle; John Eldershaw; Percy
Lindsay; Erik Langker; Salvana;
Robert Johnson; Garrett Kingsley;
James R. Jackson; Sali Herman ; C. F.
Goldie, New Zealand’s painter of
Maoris ; David Low ; Douglas Pratt;
Hayward Veal; Walter Withers ; Maud
Sherwood ; Lister-Lister ; John Baird. ...
but the list could be as long as the
catalogue, for everyone in it is either a
good painter or painted, at least, one
good picture which Howard Hinton
bagged for Armidale.
The reproductions in Howard Hinton,
Patron of Art faithfully reflect this col-
lection in its staunch affirmation of Aus-
tralian art, its catholicity of taste and its
fundamental connoisseurship. It is not
the greatest and richest art-book of Aus-
tralian painting that could be made; for
just as a full national collection would
need to include a few names Hinton has
missed and to exhibit such masterpieces
as “Fire's On,” “The Sisters” and
“Spring Frosts” from the Sydney Gallery
and Lambert’s self-portrait from Ade-
laide, so would a fully representative
book, of reproductions need to ranee
wider.
One hopes such a book will be pub-
lished; it is about time we stopped trying
to attack Gtuner. Lambert and Streeton
and, simply, accepted them ; as in liter-
ature we accept their contemporaries
such as Lawson and Tom Collins. But in
the meantime Howard Hinton, Patron of
Art serves as a sort of ground-plan for a
general survey of Australian art; and in
the number of its reproductions and the
width of its range it is certainly by far
the most liberal survey that has yet been
published.
The general effect is rather like look-
ing through a complete set of the fine*
old “Art in Australia” series ; with the
advantage that here ail the artists are
gathered together in one volume.
The color-plates, some from Hinton's
European purchases, arc reproduced
from paintings by Lambert, Emil
Pap, Ci tuner, Margaret Coen, Will
Ashton, Rupert Bunny, Jan van Beers,
Adrian Feint, Murch, Norman Lindsay,
Hans Heysen, Streeton, Dobell, James
Durden, Hilder, J. Muir Auld, Julian
Ashton (wrongly, though not un-
deservedly, knighted), James R. Jackson,
Robert Johnson and Septimils Power . . .
a rich and colorful display rising to great
heights in the exquisite cold light of
Gruner’s “Winter, Bellingen” and the
fiery and transcendent genius of Norman
Lindsay’s “Odysseus” and “Belshazzar.”
Accompanying the reproductions and
the catalogue are articles about Hinton
by Norman Lindsay, C. B. Newling and
R. H.- Goddard. Mr. Goddard, Howard
Hinton’s lifelong friend, who has himself
given many pictures as well as a valuable
collection of aboriginal relics to the
nation, was chiefly responsible for the
publication of this book, working in
close association with MrT Newling, who
was principal at Armidale when most of
the Hinton pictures were arriving and
who is now with Angus and Robertson's
educational department. Friends and re-
latives of Howard Hinton contributed
towards the cost of the color-plates so
that the book could go out to the public
at a reasonable price; Angus and
Robertson offered to produce it without
profit to themselves; other publishers
lent color-blodks ... It is not often in
this wicked world that you see a good
deed so admirably carried out; for
obviously there had to be some kind of
public memorial gesture to so great a
man as Howard Hinton, whom scores
of artists remember with gratitude and
affection and to whom the entire Aus-
tralian nation is indebted for the pre-
servation of so much of its art; and this
book, since it gives his pictures a re-
newed and far wider life,, is the sort of
memorial he would have liked above all
Others.

EIGHT AFFIRMATIONS AT JUDGMENT
And the Voice said, “Say after me,
I have not done evil to mankind.”
1 am in no position to tell.
Regard me as a swimmer who plunges into
(he sea,
causing that displacement of water adds the
fraction
of height to a tidal wave
a thousand miles away
shatters a barrier of rock and reef
to plunder a valley of its villages. O regard
me
as one who picked up a colored pebble
on the slope of a scree
and dropped it again
to cause an avalanche
ten years later that destroyed a town.
Who is there to tell me
what evil 1 have done
lo mankind? Who is there to measure
against me
the result of what was innocently begun?
And (he Voice said, “Say after me,
I have not oppressed the members of my family.”
Truly 1. have not oppressed them,
but I have been as an end unto myself.
0 had they not regarded themselves
as I have regarded myself
1 would not have come into existence. I
would not
be standing before this Judgment seat today.
And the Voice said, “Say after me,
/ have not wrought evil in the place of right and
truth.”
I am troubled over this matter of ends and
means.
It seemed my ends were clear enough,
therefore I despised the means
in a world which is a place of ends
abundant. We have regarded ourselves
as ends in ourselves. O had the members of
my family
regarded themselves as a means
1 might not have come into existence
and tremble before this judgment-seal today.
And so 1 have wrought evil
in the place of right and truth. I have
wrought evil, evil
has flourished mightily
where only good was intended. I despair,
for thoughts in flight, my lords,
too often change their color in the air.
N.Z.
And the Voice said, "Say after me,
/ have had no knowledge of worthless men.”
Is any man worthless?
You who judge me,; (ell me,
is any man wort hi css?
And the Voice said, “Say after me*
I. have not wrought evil.”
This is the third time, the third
question pointed at us, asking
of evil! Why do you ask
whether I have done evil? Can you not see
from where you sit
the simplest action and the uncontrollable
results of it?
0 had you questioned me
once, 1 would have said, No,
1 have not wrought deliberate evil.
But you question thrice! By this I know
evil deliberately done
weighs less
against my heart in the scales than evil
wrought by my quality.
My heart sinks in the scales.
Here the soul fails, it fails.
And the Voice, said, “Say after me,
I have not ill-treated servants.”
No, my lords. I have not ill-treated servants/
I have used neither scourge nor whip.
There are no servants in my house, but often
T have hooked one toward me with a fingertip
and asked service of him, half in contrition,
as if to say, “Brother,
this is a purely
relative and reversible condition.”
And the Voice said, “Say after me,
1 have not thought scorn of God.”
In this I am pure, masters,
perfect, on this score,
though scorn of Him I have spoken
more than once before.
And the Voice said, “Say after me,
I have made no one weep.”
Let this press down upon my heart,
that 1 have made many weep:
and do not give me counterweight in this
that | have often wept myself
all night along the tortured edge of sleep.
And I have done no murder,
but 1 have murdered love
and buried him deep.

History via Maekaness.
The A us trail cm Historical Monographs,
comprising edited reprints of pieces of
Australiana useful to students and issued
by Dr. George Mackaness in limited
editions of up to 100 copies, are now
reaching quite formidable proportions,
No. XXII having just been published.
Most of them provide les& limited access
to some documents which would not
otherwise be available unless the student
had. direct recourse to the originals in a
library of archives such as the Mitchell.
Earlier issues include the private
correspondence of the Marsden family,
an invaluable piece of reference; notes
on Bligh’s discoveries and observations
on Van Diemen’s Land ; a collection of
the odes of Michael Massey Robinson,
Australia’s first and only poet laureate;
“Flinders’s Observations on the Coasts
of Van Diemen's Land, on Bass Strait
and the Islands’’; the “Memoirs of
George Suttor, F.L.S., Banksian. Col-
lector: BHghV correspondence with F.
G. Bond, 1776-1811 ; and a collection of
matter relating to R L. Stevenson’s
associations with Australia.
The last three monographs printed are
all of a piece, reproducing an historically
valuable collection of narratives of
“Fourteen Journeys Over the Blue
Mountains, 1813-1841.” The first con-
tains the accounts of Gregory Blaxland
of the first crossing of 1813 ; of George
W, F>ans of the expedition of 1813-14,
which discovered the Bathurst Plains;
Wm. Cox’s story of the building of the
road to Bathurst in 1814-15 ; Macquarie’s
description of the tour over the moun-
tains during which he founded Bathurst
in 1815; Major AntiU’s journal of the
same tour. The second part includes the
descriptions of Barron Field and
D’Urville, and the interesting narrative
of 1827, published in “The Australian,”
which gives credit, to Lawson as the
originator of the expedition of 1813.
Dr. Mackaness attributes the. author-
ship of this document possibly to Cap-
tain William John Dumaresq, and
ascribes the surmise that he was the
author to me ; but in this he is wrong. K
was a surmise which I dismissed, since
it was unlikely that Dumaresq, closely
connected as he was by marriage and
official association with Governor Darl-
ing, would have chosen the journal of
Wentworth, Darling’s bitter enemy, in
winch to print his narrative. The author-
ship is a problem worth solving, since it
has an important bearing on the truth
about the origins and leadership of the
pioneer 1813 expedition.
The third brochure of the series just
issued begins with the tales of Back-
house, the Quaker visitor of 1835, and
of Charles Darwin, here in 1836, and ends
with the artless story of the journey of

Education is my game.
English instruction for
displaced persons.
Each shipload contains
a hodge-podge of academic
standards. Illiterates and uni-
versity professors, cyrillic-script
writers and ex-journalists, drift-
ing riff-raff and qualified pro-
fessional men, one-time sailors,
soldiers, opera-singers, shovel-
slingers, stenographers, suckers,
students, factory slaves, com-
mercial travellers, hums and
bums. Some have never seen
the sea. Up to now. All have
learned to survive in conditions
unbelievable. Survival in con-
ditions unbelievable involves
concomitant acquisition of
twisted attitudes, strange hatreds,
unusual sentiments, sometimes
dishonest modes of behavior.
“V/OU for the next ship,”
I says my boss.
“Yeah,” I say. Light-hearted.
Like a bull in a bog.
The author has escorted four shiploads of migrants
to Australia. This account, he says, contains no
reference to persons living or dead, nor does it
portray any particular ship.
The day is grey and glacial in
Aurich Embarkation Camp.
Shivering migrants scamper
across sleet-driven streets be-
tween barracks.
I crate equipment, find
migrant teachers to handle the
thousand-odd students, look over
the ship for class-room spaces,
devise a card system to check
school attendance, organise
timetables, lesson programmes,
films, ship’s newspaper, kinder-
garten, English ability tests,
library, Australianisation lec-
tures.
Managing a squirming team
of twenty or thirty teachers is
no picnic. A pat on the back
here, a scream of rage there, a
long smile one minute, a
ferocious snarl the next.
There’s Zodowicz. Star
teacher. Once university lec-
turer in rhetoric (or was it
physics?) at Budapest. Maybe
it was Prague or Warsaw. A
bulbous proboscis, thick goggles
and an ability to perspire in sub-
zero temperatures. He detests
being a D.P. Resents being con-
trolled. He regards instructional
advice as interference. He’s
going to make trouble.
And Hrranovszki. Another
Under-secretary of State from
Poland. One gets the impres-
sion that Poland’s population
falls into two divisions. Under-
secretaries of State and the
minority. Hrranovszki is going
to be easy. His smile is genuine.
And Sonja, the school secre-
tary. Wide eyes that glint like
dew on gin glasses. Pile-up hair-
do, nylons, aquamarine pendant
and earrings to match. She
uses a typewriter, too.
AT Nordenham we sulk
through the German Cus-
toms, gravitate to the saloon
where ship’s officers, Australian
officers, 1.R.0. officers, friends
and hangers-on accumulate to
chatter. I smoke the free
smokes. Swipe the free liquor.
Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-
bye.
Good luck, Aussie. You’ll
need it out there on the frontier
of civilisation. Gone for ever
the color and culture of Europe.
Shouldering the white man’s
burden. Blazing trails through
malarial swamps. Hob-nobbing
with colonials.
All right. All right.
Outside on the bleak windy
quay, unkempt migrants are
struggling with hand-luggage
through fastidious German
officialdom. Up the swaying
gangway. The escort-
officer and his girl
assistant are hopelessly
trying to control the
jostling throng. Zodo-
wicz is volubly deplor-
ing shipboard organisa-
tion.
“Nobody will push
me around,” he de-
clares. For bystanders’
benefit. He wipes his
spectacles.
I find my cabin under the
bridge, throw the typewriter on
the bunk, unwind the radio
aerial through the wide port, up
to the bridge, up to the flying
bridge, up to the radar tower; I
clinch it with wire every few
yards. The chief officer is right
behind me unclinching and coil-
ing the aerial. Neatly.
“Not a Chinese laundry,” he
tells me. Tactfully.
He has the warm yielding
nature of a stringybark. He
shows me an aerial plug in the
cabin bulkhead. Thanks, Chief.
Into the cheerless Channel.
On captain’s inspection I am
horrified by the miserable de-
meanors of seasick passengers.
Things could be worse. Much
worse. One voyage the ship
was a thousand tons short of
ballast with a list that increased
as fuel-tanks emptied. Life on
an unlevel basis was exasperat-
ing. The tip-tilted tub tottered
into Bone, Algeria, to fill oil-
tanks with salt-water, then reeled
into Port Said to lean against
the dock for three days while
labor gangs packed Sahara sand
into the keel.
Bucking and rolling through
Biscay Bay. My cabin is cosy
and shipshape. Outside the rain
is driving hard over white
combers. The escort-officer in-
state himself in the only lounge
chair and recites sleazy jokes be-
tween slugs of gin. This stuff
does me no good at all.
The assistant escort-officer re-
counts war adventures.
“I’m looking for excitement,”
she says.
I shake hands with myself.
The second-mate tells how the
radar detected a mine during his
nocturnal trick. I am dismayed.
The second-steward exhibits
photos of women he has wooed.
I applaud. The skipper discusses
Australian poetry, tells us that
Henry Lawson came from a
Norwegian family. I am im-
pressed. The escort-officer re-
iterates amorous anecdotes; this
time with photographic illustra-
tions, I try not to look. The
chief produces a bottle of spirits
in an attempt to alleviate tedium.
Tedium is not alleviated.
We buffet by Cape Finisterre,
pound down the Portuguese
coast.
Fire-alarm drill. I help whop-
ping wenches marshal offspring
at boat-stations, stagger up and
down slippery steel stairways
laden with squalling kids.
As usual the vessel develops
into a toiling, broiling, crumble-
jumble cauldron of trouble.
Hysteria, weeping women and
hostile males. Drammamine
benefits the ailing hordes to
some extent. But seasickness is
aggravated by unaccustomed
diet, new living conditions, ad-
justment problems, fear of the
future, mob panic and plain
fright. Bed-bugs are discovered
in sleeping quarters.
Some crew members regard a
migrant ship as an organised
brothel. The escort - officer
energetically opposes this view.
Involved parties wrangle bitterly
before my amazed gaze. Tears
and wringing of hands, a scream-
ing storm outside, a rolling
cabin and the holds cram-
jammed with weeping migrants.
J N the deserted mess-hall I pep-
* talk my team of teachers.
Zodowicz interpolates mali-
ciously. Seditiously.
We pass the twelve-mile-wide
Gibraltar Strait. Open decks
are too blustering for class
groups, so I muster migrants in
dining compartments, present
elementary English lessons with
strip-films. Black rats run the
ventilator-pipes overhead.
Along the North African
coast. Past the Isle of Galita.
Past Bizerta. The glow from
Etna is visible in the night. The
ship’s doctor spends dizzy days
pumping gamma globulin into
giddy kiddies. At night he dis-
penses fruit - cup from an
enamelled hospital basin to a
cabinful of guzzling guests.
Boredom is avoided in the same
old way. Dance disks and
straight Scotch. Sentimental
student choruses. We eat
cigarettes, gulp gin with chlori-
nated water until the night slips
by fast. The giggling stage. The
ferocious period. Smoky
memories and sugared phrases.
The doc has a grudge. “I
want to know who put anaesthetic
in my vaseline,” he grumbles.
Once he is called away to plug
morphine into an agonising
female and once to sew up the
mangled stump of a butcher’s
finger. And a case of appendi-
citis sends us six hours back to
Malta.
Next day is next day. Fret-
ting and sweating through film
lessons, Australianisation lec-
tures. The idle migrants love
it. Happy as sugar-ants in sher-
bet. But I grow tired.
The effort needed to disre-
gard the smooth secretary’s
physical charm increases alarm-
ingly. She looks at me and my
feet perspire. I give her some
typewriting and walk the deck
to clear my head.
'TEN O’CLOCK one morning
1 we park opposite Port Said’s
filthy facade. Bumboats and
slim power-craft surround us.
Passengers line the rails, gaze
down fascinated at the gesticu-
lating dusky vendors, try to use
out-dated German banknotes as
currency.
Ten hours ashore. We skim
the Cairo highway in a hired
car, peer conventionally at the
eroded sides, blunt-ended apex of
the Great Pyramid ; evidence of
five thousand years of weather-
ing. The Great Pyramid was
once sheathed in alabaster which
was pinched to build Mohammed
All’s Mosque in the city. As
the Coliseum marble was
pinched to line the Chiesa di
San Pietro. And the Reichs-
chancellerie granite now graces
the modern Russian war monu-
ment.
Back to the ship. Escape
from the clinging, clamoring,
clawing kleptomaniacs. Unarm,
Eros, the long day’s task is done,
and we must rest. But no. We
are followed.
“The boat-taxi will cost you
six dollars.”
“But you said six shillings.”
“Oh! Ha, ha. A small mis-
take. Of course you are right.”
“So we pay six shillings?”
“That’s right. Six shillings
each.”
“What r
“And six shillings each way.”
The voice is soft and silky like
a dyspeptic cockatoo.
Streaming sunshine as we coast
down the canal. Matutinal
grapefruit and a sunny few
hours to check the education
set-up. A midday sleep and some
dictation for the school secre-
tary. Enervating, that routine.
With another three weeks to
Sydney.
After dinner the usual discus-
sion with the newspaper team,
the library team. The evening’s
hour of talk about Australia.
Basic-wage, work conditions,
overtime, penalty rates, housing
shortage.
Any questions?
I am prepared for the inevi-
table. Crocodiles, snakes, abo-
rigines, alcohol, kangaroos.
I harangue the teachers, duti-
fully, for the next hour; point
out how teaching technique
might be improved. Zodowicz
smoulders over one or two com-

As pleasant as a blue-tongued

Ismailia. PortTewfik. Mount
Sinai. Gulf of Suez. Jidda, port

Comes the first heat with bad
tempers and jangled nerves. The
hospital battles busily with
feverish females and sun-
blistered school students. The
chief stretches awning fore and
aft to shade sweating English
classes. I shout with rage once
or twice, relax audibly in the
proximity of the pliant Polish
blonde. Her fingernails flare like
checker berries in chili-wine.
She prattles peevishly. Sex-
appeal can be a liability, she
discovers. Brilliantly. Jealous
wives hate her ; husbands avoid
her. Fearfully. The gaudy girl
is lonely and conspicuous.
“Yeah,” I say.
“Yeah,” she says.
Snappy, that repartee, with
the ruddy Red Sea burning our
eyes out.
PAST Perim Island. Bicker-
ings, national preju-
dices, undercurrents of feeling
develop extensively and inten-
sively in the fermentation en-
gendered by restricted space and
rising temperatures. The unlit
fo’c’sle of nights is ghastly
with mooning couples in em-
braces too hideous to contem-
plate. In daylight the greasy
scorching iron decks and suffo-
cating lounges are littered with
hot sweaty bodies, groups of
card-gamblers, gossipers, women
in foundation garments, scrawny
males in dirty briefs, grubby,
restless children.
Through the Gulf of Aden.
Noise and humidity. Talking is
out of fashion. Screaming is
normal.
Cape Guardafui. Babies
stippled with heat-rash. Student
types memorising Basic English
and looking intense. Quarrels in
mess-queues. Friction between
hubbies and wives. Hysterical
resentment looking for an ex-
cuse to explode.
Ship’s teacher Lugaci goes
into retirement. He gets out of
his bunk one hazy lazy morning ;
mental processes are somewhat
flaccid. He slips an empty
dentifrice tube into his mouth
and tosses his dentures through
the port. Into the blue. Lousy
luck, Lugaci.
I sleep sporadically. I awake
yellow-gutted; reach automati-
cally for the aspirin solution.
Uneventful days of feverish
nothingness flickering past too
vague for memories. Blue Indian

I climb to the flying bridge to
watch the slow flash of the sun-

writer to paint cream lotion on
the hot skin of her sunburnt
legs. The last treacle rays of the
sun pour across the thick carpet.
The radio beats through a
drowsy lullaby. The second-mate

hungrily at the serene secretary.
I regard him with no compla-

Tropical nights are a torment

I eat the saloon dinner, take a

LION.
Lion let your desert eyes
turn on me.
Look beyond my flesh and see
that in it which never dies;
that which neither sleeps nor wakes—
the pool of glass
where no wave rocks or breaks,
where no days or nights pass.
Your shining eyes like the sun will find
an image there
that will answer stare for stare
till with that gaze your gaze is blind.
Though you wear the face of the sun
in the mortal gold of your eyes,
yet till that Lord himself dies
this deeper image will live on.
It is the crystal glance of love
earth turns on sun as the two move.
It is the jewel I was given
in exchange for your heaven.

GOVERNMENT AND COAL.
Taking their first enthusiastic steps in
modern industrial science, our grand-
fathers called coal the “black diamond.”
That is true in inorganic chemistry, and
today is just about true in another way.
Coal has been called the key, the crux,
the king-pin of our national economy.
That there can be no progress for Aus-
tralia without it is axiomatic, and
importation from overseas for our
current needs can be only a temporary
and limited expedient.
The Menzies Government is now due
to make good certain pledges about get-
ting the coal this country needs. The
coalmining industry has for 20 years been
a mess —often inefficient, always Com-
munist-ridden. There is no quick
remedy for overcoming the bad
atmosphere existing today between
employer and miner. It cannot be
blocked off like fire-damp in a mine-
working. But where sheer lawlessness
and malice is infecting it industrial
authority must take the necessary action.
The McGirr Government in N.S.W.
has given up any pretence of action. In
the terms of the Joint Coal Board agree-
ment, it contributes to the Combined-
Governments scheme most of the con-
stitutional power for action while the
Commonwealth Government contributes
most of the money. The belated Coal
Board reports leave no doubt on which
of the Governments is bearing that
burden: in the four years of the board’s
career the Commonwealth has spent on
it just under £8,000,000, New South
Wales a little over £400,000, and even so
the McGirrites are crying over the bill.
“Without coal,” said Mr. Menzies in
his policy speech, “we can have neither
full employment nor full production.
We must therefore get coal.” His recipe
included;
Development of open-cut mining:.
Mechanisation of mines and mechanical
extraction of pillar coal.
Building: up reserves of coal, initially by
importing:. [lmportations so far have
simply eked out starvation supplies im-
posed by strikes.]
The Joint Coal Board to set a target
of production for each mine to meet cur-
rent requirements and reasonable reserve.
Research and development of brown and
inferior coal measures.
In the light of this pledge of Govern-
ment action, it is instructive to study the
latest Coal Board reports, only recently
made public, covering activities of the
past three years, and comments on the
prospects as seen in the latter half of last
year.
So far —and this is some measure
of what should henceforth be expected
of the board —it has for an expenditure
of over £8,000,000 of public funds lifted
the annual output of coal in N.S.W. by
only 500,000 tons between 1947 and 1950
(half-year), and that entirely from open-
cut workings. Of course the expenditure
included much capital outlay of repro-
ductive sort (earth-moving plant and
mechanical underground equipment), but
this is precisely the justification for de-
manding better production results in
future.
There must also be allowances
for the gigantic job which has confronted
the board of reorganising the entire
industry in face of political indifference
or interference by one or both of the
Governments which established it, some
antipathy from the colliery-owners,
to whom the board is as a child
teaching its grandmother to suck eggs,
and the plain hostility of the Communist-
led Miners’ Federation, which has
pursued as relentless a war against this
experiment in modified Government
control of the mines as it did against
uncontrolled colliery companies pre-
viously.
The board was set the multiple
tasks of increasing output while re-
organising the business, of working open-
cuts with inadequate machinery or in
uneconomical pits handed over to it
(that is, of getting more coal somehow
at any price and of any quality), of pros-
pecting new areas for opencuts and deep-
mining alike —and this, too, with the
constant nightmare of inadequate trans-
port services for the removal of coal got.
Although the board is relying upon
increased opencut output of coal to
reduce by 1954 the difference between
demand and supply—the market survey
puts requirements in that year at 18.5
million tons (surely conservative!) and
the present all-Australian production of
black coal is just under 15 million —it
points out that the latest estimate of
potential opencut resources (about 50 to
55 million tons) is a mere bagatelle beside
the 11,500 million tons of reserves under-
ground, that many opencut workings,
actual or potential, are remote from
transport routes, require extensive test-
ing by drills before work can start, are
subject to interruption in wet weather,
and that opencut production will meet
the emergency demand for “only a com-
paratively short period.” In plain
language the reliance must be on
orthodox coalmining with a radical
modernisation of coal-getting methods.
Meanwhile opencut workings are being
relied upon to keep industry in coal while
reorganisation underground proceeds.
With badly-exploited coal measures
and ill-temper dominating the industrial
relationships in the industry, the board
has mad© a start with financing the
mechanisation of selected mines, and has
made an analysis of efficiency in produc-
tion in various categories of mines
accordingly as they are all-machine-
loaded, with or without modem haulage,
partly - machine - loaded, or all - hand-
loaded.
It finds that:
The average production per man-shift
was 85 per cent, greater In the (small)
all-mechanised group—"A” group—than
for the three other groups combined, and
the average output per employee was 103
per cent, greater.
That each man in “A” group worked
ten more shifts in six months than the
others.
That loss of man-shifts in “A” group
through “absence on compensation” (a
rough measure of mine-safety) was 24 per
cent, less than the average loss for the
whole industry.
But that voluntary absenteeism in “A”
group was 27 per cent, greater than the
average for the Industry as a whole.
The study has convinced the board that
complete mechanisation is the only solu-
tion of the basic trouble, that in re-
organisation the policy must be all or
nothing, and that there are no short-cuts.
The job “may require £20,000,000 at
1948 costs,” and there can be no
appreciable increase in potential under-
ground production for at least three
years. Except in a very few instances,
under special conditions, power-borer
equipment is now fully provided at the
coal-faces.
This is the picture of how shortages
are chasing each other’s tails in the three
basic industries on which Australia’s
development depends:
Each forms, so to speak, one leg of the
industrial tripod upon which our pros-
perity is set. Steel production Is held
back firstly by shortage of coal and
secondly by shortage of labor, which can-
not be obtained because of the shortage of
building materials for housing. The re-
organisation of the coal industry is re-
tarded by the shortage of steel and of labor,
which again depends upon housing and
building materials. The development of
adequate housing for the community as a
whole, and for the coalfields and the steel
centres in particular, is delayed because of
shortage of steel and c0a1.... These
three bottlenecks can only be broken if
each of the three Industries gives an over-
riding priority to the other.
The coal produced, costly and insuf-
ficient, has deteriorated considerably in
quality since 1939, last of that era of coal
luxury when most plants were built to
use premium coal, and we wasted our
prime fuel with the same recklessness as
our forefathers wasted our high-class
native timbers. The Sydney County
Council alone wants twice as much coal
now as then; as its furnaces were
designed for coal with a very high ash
temperature —on Rolls-Royce ideas, so
to speak—the public is now paying the
penalty.
The board’s ultimatum to all coal-users
is in these words:
The community, and major consumers in
particular, must face up to the fact that
in the future coal quality will be lower
than it was 10 or 15 years ago. This
means that neW plant and equipment must
be designed... .to use the qualities of
coal which will in fact be mined.
Government policy which the board
has been operating requires modernisa-
tion of the “amenities” of mining towns
as well as of coal-getting methods. The
board reports increasing annual outlay
on sport fields, libraries, recreational
centres, the sponsoring of loan and co-
operative building societies and the like.
But against its four-year effort to induce
a new atmosphere in the industry there
stand out three ugly abuses —deliberate
and often spiteful absenteeism, the dis-
graceful, underproduction through “the
darg” which goes far to defeat the
extension of mechanical aids, and the
refusal of the miners’ leaders to counten-
ance mechanical extraction of pillar-
coal.
These are matters for urgent Govern-
ment attention. If the Red leaders on
the coalfields are determined to defy
authority on any or all of these issues,
then the Government and the public must
face a showdown unflinchingly.
"Labor" and the Law.
li is a principle of British and Aus-
tralian justice that law was created
basically to protect and serve the indi-
vidual, and that the State is only
machinery for assuring his welfare. But
the McGirrs and Chifleys now appear to
accept another doctrine: that the State
and its fatted employees are the first con-
sideration and the electors merely
machinery to keep them in office and
feed departments with unlimited revenue.
Mr. McGirr’s Transport Department
no longer seems to accept the principle
that a person is innocent until proven
guilty. It has set out to organise
a campaign in which two or three
of its inspectors will board trams
and publicly interrogate citizens who are
suspected of not paying their fares with
a view to “embarrassing” them and
teaching them a lesson.
Certainly the N. S. Wales transport
administrators have been brought to
desperate straits. The McGirr Ministry
introduced the 40-hour week regardless
of cost to its transport system, and the
whole election policy of the McGirr party
has been one calculated to breed a race
of scalers and loafers. Little wonder,
perhaps, that transport commissioners
have inherited, on the one hand, a class
of customers who object to paying their
fares, and, on the other, a class of
employees who object to doing a fair
day’s work.
But, however it may be defended on
the grounds of expediency, this latest type
of war on scalers (and often on persons
who have not had a chance to pay their
fares) emphasises the decrepitude into
which State-run enterprises have fallen,
the desperate remedies resorted to when
socialisation bogs down, and how utterly
demoralising have been the effects of
Governments, and “Labor” Govern-
ments in particular, which enforce
laws only when they feel they are popular
or when they are in line with the inclina-
tions of the bullying unions which form
the staple of the A.L.P. organisation.
Any statute which runs counter to
union or A.L.P. or mob interests be-
comes a dead-letter, and this is breeding
a universal contempt for the law.
The death penalty in England is against
“Labor” principles, but since it exists in
law it is carried out by “Labor” Govern-
ments, and will be till they come round
to abolishing it —a Royal Commission
has sat on the matter in the past few
months. But in New South Wales the
position arises that the neck of the vilest
ruffian in the country is safe so long as
“Labor” is in power, irrespective of the
law ; and there is a strong feeling among
lawyers that jail gates open much more
easily to other malefactors with a “Labor”
Administration in the saddle.
The most dangerous trend is that
by which the Governments have
come to differentiate in their attitude to
law-enforcement between classes and be-
tween those offences in which prosecution
is of benefit to their Treasuries or other-
wise.
Thus the income-tax department in
collecting revenue enforces under special
laws payments which individuals are pre-
pared to dispute legally. It garnishees
without the intervention of the courts.
And it does not, and cannot, justify its
proceedings except on the ground of
expediency.
A solicitor, writing about the new “em-
barrassment” technique of Mr. McGirr’s
Transport Department, declared the other
day that he was convinced that if a lot of
people understood their rights and pleaded
not guilty in the courts they would be
acquitted, but that as often as not they
believed they were guilty because they
were told so by officials. This is un-
doubtedly the case with traffic offences.
On the other hand, while the N. S.
Wales and some other Governments have
so increased and multiplied their prosecu-
tions for parking and similar offences that
they have become a routine revenue-
collecting device, they are very careful
not to attack certain kinds of organised
interests, or to attack them only in a
desultory fashion and as a sort of token
formality. S.-p. bookmaking is a huge
business in New South Wales —somebody
recently estimated its turnover at
£180,000,000 a year. The Government
has never attacked it seriously. Only
occasionally an operator is fined. When
an offender is fined it is almost with an
air of apology.
By reason of the Government and
police attitude the public has come to
take it for granted that s.-p. bookmaking
is not morally wrong, but that the law
regarding if is a contemptible thing.
And matters have gone so far that even
once thoroughly law-abiding newspapers
shape their racing news with a view to
co-operating with this illegal “industry.”
Similarly, the liquor and licensing
laws, and particularly those which apply
to blackmarkets, closing hours and
accommodation, are flagrantly ignored.
The Government could promptly clean
up the blackmarket in liquor—and other
blackmarkets—in N. S. Wales if it liked
by the passage of a simple statute naming
a few offences for which imprisonment
of both principals and abettors would
be mandatory, and through which
licensed persons caught at it would be
delicensed. It could transform the drink-
ing dens which call themselves hotels
into decent hostelries such as exist in
Adelaide and other capitals, and provide
a reasonable supply of bottled beer if it
liked. It could make s.-p. betting un-
payable, as well as a hundred other forms
of lawlessness, such as that practised by
fraudulent builders and blackmarketeers
of building materials, who are doing
much to inflate the cost of homes.
Federal and State “Labor’s” treatment
of union lawlessness as the emanation of
the “rights” of the trade-unions, their own
lawless actions as Governments, their
continuous agitation to preserve freedom
of speech and action of a few Com-
munist bosses and bureaucrats against the
interests and security of the Australian
people at large show the direction in
which they are moving. “Labor’s” own
A.L.P. president—both Federal and N. S.
Wales—Mr, J. A. Ferguson, through
whom “Labor” Governments admittedly
receive their orders, has openly within
the past few years advocated government-
by-regulation in this country. And
govemment-by-regulation can mean only
one thing—government in the interests
of the Government, not of the governed.
As things are at present the N. S.
Wales Government and Federal
“Labor” Governments when in office
give active support only to such parts of
the law as suit the purposes of the
class-war and the cajoling of the
gullible and greedy sections of the
population. Civil law with them is,
indeed, becoming a convenience for poli-
tical purposes or a revenue-collecting
device.
Job for Free Enterprise.
A Westralian named H. R. Howard
spoke up at the annual conference of
the Associated Chambers of Commerce
in Melbourne the other day and said it
was about time businessmen stopped
being silent and started to tell the com-
munity about the virtues of free enter-
prise more loudly and frequently.
Something like this is overdue. The
collection of cranks who go under the
names of Communists, Socialists and
Leftists have had a wonderful propa-
ganda innings for the past 10 years, and
they got away with it largely because
enough hasn’t been heard from those who
practise and advocate free enterprise.
In Australia, whose people are nothing
if not enterprising and whose progress
has been made by free enterprise,
there is a veritable ocean of Socialist
propaganda. Much of it is organised,
much more of it fed by sentimentalists
and frustrates of all kinds. The waters
of this ocean are turgid with muddled
thinking, fixed and moth-eaten notions
based on the writings of impractical
people, and the deliberate and calculated
slime of Communism.
Businessmen great and small, as this
Mr. Howard hinted, ought to have more
to say. Most of them would offer the
excuse that they are too busy. This is
reasonable enough, but it is significant that
the busy people are silent, whereas most
of the noise from the other side comes
from people who do nothing practical,
produce nothing, invent nothing, think oi
nothing but getting control of somebody
else’s life, business and property. The
little suburban shopkeeper running a one-
man business, the man running a one-
man farm, the chap who prefers to work
for himself for longer hours and less
money than he would get in a wages job
-—each of them is worth a thousand
Socialists,
Private enterprise in America isn t
silent. It has so much to say that
Socialism, Communism and their on-
shoots are literally talked down.
It ought to cheer the advocates or tre
enterprise that, in spite of all the pr°pa-
ganda against it, Australians instinctive
believe in it. But free enterprise must
speak up. Already its opponents ; have
gained much ground, particularly in
Governments, and one of the
most urgent jobs confronting
prise is to reveal publicly, by cve P, u ,
possible, the growing menace ot h
cracy.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Firmness Will Pay.
Government action on the decision of
the Federal Communist leaders of the
Seamen’s, Wharflaborers’ and Painters and
Dockers* unions to ban New Zealand
shipping shows what a little firmness can
do.
A few weeks ago the Communist
leaders were yelling that they would not
allow any Government to govern which
was not approved by them. “Labor’
members in the Federal House were to a
man warning Mr. Menzies against provo-
cative action and demanding that he
should lay his hands off the unions, re-
frain from passing secret-ballot legisla-
tion and his Arbitration Act amendment.
Their speeches contained references
to the “rights” of trade-unions, which they
obviously believed to override the law.
The A.C.T.U. rushed in with election
advertisements to back its Parliamentary
agents. And the voice of the A.L.P. was
heard in the background.
The Government was elected with a
majority in the House of Representatives
and also with one in the Senate. When
it.became clear that it was now in control
of Parliament all the bluster and threats
from “Labor” ceased.
When the Communist unions (some of
them members of the A.L.P., while their
leaders sat on the Communist Central
Committee) began to organise the shipping
ban to help the New Zealand conspiracy
and it became clear that the Government
would act, the A.C.T.U., formed origin-
ally under Communist auspices, opposed
it. The swashbuckling Mr. Ferguson,
Federal boss of “Labor,” and Messrs.
Chifley, Evatt, Ashley, Drakeford,
Calwell and the rest, like old soldiers,
faded away. Only on the Communist
stamping-ground of Sydney Domain has
there been any fireworks. The Sydney
port was the only one at which large
numbers walked off the wharves after the
security-police raid, though in Williams-
town (Vic.) the Port Halifax was still
“black” when this was written, and was
being loaded for N.Z. by soldiers. The
Communist leaders were still trying to
devise means to save their faces.
What has been done by the Govern-
ment will not, of course, defeat the Com-
munists. It will probably drive them to
more underhand methods. But it will
hamper them, and it will make them
wary and exhibit them to their followers
for what they are—dingoes, not lions.
The electors put the Menzies Govern-
ment back to deal with the Communists
and lawless unionists by every legal
means. Its supporters will increase the
more determined it shows itself to be to
do the job.
Reds Getting Cold Feet?
After all the blustering resolutions of
the Miners’ Central Council against the
bonus-award by the Coal Tribunal for 10
consecutive shifts worked (with a proviso
for pro rata payment in case of unavoid-
able absence by a mine-worker), its Com-
munist-boss Williams told an aggregate
meeting at Belmont, on the northern coal-
fields, in effect, to accept the award under
protest as the executive could not recom-
mend “a strike now,” but would “pick its
battleground on something bigger that
might take place in the future.” The
aggregate meetings were all poorly
attended, but they lost some 60,000 tons
of coal.
Another member of the executive at a
Kurri meeting was more explicit. He
said a fight on the bonus issue “would be
far from favorable,” because:
The A.C.T.U. would not support the
miners.
Some mining unions had already
accepted bonus payments, also many in
the Miners’ Federation.
In addition, there was “the repressive
legislation” threatened by the Common-
wealth Government.
He added: “The law is that the owners
must pay this bonus, and whether the
men throw it away or give it to the
hospitals is their own concern.”
Communist vice-president Parkinson
said at Cessnock that the miners were
“not in position for a head-on collision
with the Menzies Government on the
issue, nor in a position to resume one-
day stoppages or to have a general strike.”
A few days earlier these leaders had
drawn up resolutions that sounded like
Chinese bugle-blowing about resistance to
“the war plans of the Menzies Govern-
ment,” “the vicious attacks of the Coal
Tribunal on the Federation,” “the objec-
tionable interference in our affairs by
the Coal Board,” and “the veiled threats
of the A.C.T.U, president.” Communist
Williams called the bonus award “blood
money.” But most of the mining union
membership appears glad to have it, and
any split in the Miners’ Federation would
obviously be attributable to the execu-
tives’ efforts to prevent the offered “blood
money” from being accepted.
These dupes of the Communist fifth-
column in the miners’ and other unions
will wake up one day to the way in
which they have been led by the nose.
The awakening may be coming about
even now. Communist Brown’s Vic-
torian railways unionists dutifully com-
plied with Brown’s directions at the
annual conference last week and rejected
“moderates’ ” resolutions in favor of
secret ballots. Thus Communist Brown
(who is also the union’s returning officer
for elections of executive officials, includ-
ing himself) is still free to call on light-
ning strikes without consulting union
members.
But Communist Brown’s annual report
and financial statement disclosed that his
union had gone £12,000 to the bad
last year, including £7OOO still owed to
other unions, borrowed during the 1950
rail strike. When critics in the conference
demanded “a full financial report of the
strike, showing what it had cost the
union,” Comrade Brown declined to
oblige.
And that other Communist agent who
bosses the watersiders, general secretary
Healy, who went to the Melbourne branch
meeting to see that the recently “tried
and convicted” local secretary Clarke did
not swing the Melbourne wharfies against
a Communist ban on N.Z. ships, told
the meeting that he had ordered, from
Sydney, the Melbourne port ban, and that
“that is what I am paid to do, and if I
don’t somebody would soon be on my
back.” This Commo-bossed union is also
now at war with the A.C.T.U. and at
noon on Monday was still steering for
that “head-on collision” with the Com-
monwealth Government which gave the
miners’ bosses cold feet last week. The
move to take a fresh ballot of branches
on the issue, however, suggested signs of
cold feet there, too.
That the A.C.T.U. realises it cannot
sit on the fence any longer offers some
hope to the mass of Australian unionists.
Communist leaders’ reaction shows that
the A.C.T.U. possesses some influence to
nip these sabotage-strikes in the bud if
it likes to act resolutely.
Events in Asia.
“Ek Dum”: There is a curious flavor
about Asian events this week. In Korea
the command reports overwhelming
victories against countless hordes of Com-
munists who are supposedly running for
their lives under the impact of new
weapons. The aftermath of the last Com-
munist advance is reported to be “the
greatest rout of the Communist war.”
The reports are entirely official. Press
correspondents at the front seem to be as
thoroughly defeated as the Chinese. The
stories are full of news of pincer-move-
ments to engulf tens of thousands, of
unresisting Chinese surrendering in large
batches, of retreating columns wiped out
completely, of aerial blitzes and generally
of a staggering victory which suggests
that the whole Chinese effort has gone
to pieces.
It is to be hoped it is all true. It
comes at a time when curious and sinister
events are taking place in other parts of
the world and the retirement might con-
ceivably be as much due to them as to the
fabulous weapons which are described in
Korea as turning advancing troops into a
puff of smoke.
Just about the moment when the
reported debacle began the Persian oil
crisis developed its heat, Russia started
to assemble nationalist forces on the
North Persian border. The Persian Par-
liament seemed to go completely insane
in its abuse of the British and Americans
and in its determination, on the basis of
its conviction that the British Socialist
Government is a feeble and broken thing
incapable of action, to throw out the
Anglo-Persian Oil Company on its own
terms and irrespective of its agreement
with the co., of international law, and of
all the tenets of civilised commerce and
international intercourse.
The British Government mysteriously
alerted a parachute force. Almost im-
mediately afterwards the Canadian
Minister for External Affairs made a sober
and well-reasoned plea that any chance
to settle the Korean war on reasonable
terms should be seized. He made a
second statement later reinforcing his
first one.
Next came the rumor from Europe that
Russia had made an approach for a
settlement through a Swedish millionaire
and that an American delegation was on
its way to Moscow to discuss terms.
At the same time there are military
moves in progress throughout Eastern
Europe. Hungary has been added to the
Iron Curtain countries in which the local
armies are commanded by Russian
generals. There are also moves in China
far away from Korea —particularly oppo-
site Formosa, where there is a great mass-
ing of troops.
The situation is, despite the reports from
Korea, dangerous and unsettled, and there
is nothing to suggest, whatever the extent
of General Ridgway’s victories, that the
general position of the world is swinging
towards peace. The attitude of Moscow
is ominous, and not the least sinister thing
about, it is its sudden dropping of its
world-peace propaganda, in which there
has been a noticeable lull in the past week
or so.
Field-Marshal Blarney.
“Ek Bum’s” estimate:
Death has taken Field-Marshal Sir Thomas
Blarney, after a long illness borne with great
fortitude, at the age of 67. He had been 11
months in Heidelberg Military Hospital.
General Blarney was a soldier whose distinc-
tion was all too little appreciated by his fellow-
countrymen. He was bom at Wagga (N.S.W.)
in 1884, son of a local businessman. He be-
came a schoolteacher, and, as with so many
leading officers of the First and Second A.I.Fs.,
his cadet activities led him into wider fields. In
1906 he became a permanent officer, trained for
the staff at Quetta Staff College, and saw a
little service on the Afghan frontier with a
British corps. . .
He was in England attached to a British divi-
sion when war broke out in 1914, but when
the A.I.F. was formed he was called to join
the staff of Major-General Bridges.
The only regimental command which he held
during World War I was that of the Second Bat-
talion, a post necessary to his higher staff pro-
motion, and he also held command for a time
of the First Infantry Brigade. He passed through
the phases of G.S.O. service to be Chief of
Staff of the Australian Army Corps.
He saw the war through from end to end,
being in the midst and forefront of some of
the most dangerous operations both in Galli-
poli and France, frequently in hand-to-hand
contact with the enemy.
At- the end of the war his reputation stood
very high among all armies. He had become
General Monash’s C.O.S, at 35. His orders for
the Australian part in the final drive which
broke the Hindenburg Line realised the prophecy
of General Monash that they would become
models for use in staff colleges.
He was for a time Australian Defence Repre-
sentative in London, after which he served for
two years of frustration as Chief of Staff of
the dwindling and moribund Australian military
forces, until he retired in 1926 to become Vic-
torian Police Commissioner.
In World War II he held command of the
fighting forces throughout from the formation
of the Sixth Division. In April, 1941, he was
promoted to the full rank of General, and be-
came Deputy C.-in-C. under Field-Marshal
Wavell in the Middle East.
In that position he was held responsible by a
carping Press for many decisions which he
neither made nor could influence, and he made
himself less popular during a visit to Australia
towards the end of 1941 by his scathing criti-
cism of the public failure to realise the dangers
which threatened this country.
When war came with Japan he became Com-
mander-in-Chief, under General MacArthur, of
Allied Land Forces in the South-west Pacific
area. He assumed this command in an atmos-
phere in which the Press could see no good in
anybody but the Americans and Russians —an
atmosphere in which some rags rejoiced
when, at the most crucial and arduous stage of
the organisation of Australian defence against
possible invasion, a hostess on an airliner re-
fused to allow him to sit at a window seat so
that he might view the country which he was
to defend.
It was characteristic that he simply obeyed
the command of the officious young lady, an
attitude in keeping with the complete equa-
nimity under opposition and criticism which he
displayed throughout the war. Whenever there
was peril or alarm it could be taken for granted
that he would be found calm, equable, evaluat-
ing the situation judicially and ready to explain
it more lucidly and with more forethought than
most others. But he could speak out boldly and
vigorously when need be. Few knew how much
and how hard he fought behind the scenes for
Australian prestige and against the submerging
of the Australian interest in the South Pacific
war, to which the obsequious “Labor” Govern-
ment in Canberra was sometimes prone. And
the tale of the official panics which he allayed
has yet to be told. __
Not the type of senior officer either to court
mob adulation or to inspire it, he was a general’s
general. His views had the respect of the
highest military authorities everywhere, and the
grant last year of the first Field-Marshal’s
baton awarded to an Australian was very much
more than a mere formal gesture to the com-
mander of the Australian forces, which, in
the fighting areas of the south-west Pacific, were
at the height of the 1942-45 war greater than
were employed by Wellington during most of
the Peninsula War.
Field-Marshal Blarney’s reputation will, like
that of F.-M. Alexander, improve with age and
in time outstrip that of many other com-
manders who now usurp the limelight.
The Wool Scheme.
Before the Menzies Government goes any
further with this prickly post-J.O. wool
scheme it ought to set about finding out
where and with whom the idea originated
and then cause the originators to explain
themselves.
As far as can be ascertained by ordi-
nary people, somebody or other, in a fit
of foresight not common to officials,
realised a couple of years ago that the
Joint Organisation’s function of feeding
in war-time surplus wools to the post-
war auction market without affecting the
price levels would soon end because there
would be no more war-time surplus wool.
Then, with memories of the now 20-year-
old slump in wool prices, it was tenta-
lively suggested that perhaps the J.O.
set-up could be used to create a means
of putting a “floor price” under wool by
buying it in when auction prices fell to
unprofitable levels for the grower, and
feeding it back to the market at or above
“floor price.”
From that very tentative idea has
developed a sort of headlong rush by the
four Governments concerned to create
what is called a “minimum-reserve prices
plan for wool,” and no sooner was the
election over than Commerce Minister
McEwen was out with a proposal to
establish a fund of £B2£ million for the
purpose. To that fund Britain would
contribute £l5 million, Australian growers
£4B million, and New Zealand and South
African growers the balance.
Australian growers are to be asked to
vote on this proposition. The chances of
them supporting it appear to be slim, not
because they don’t want a safeguard
against a slump, but because, as R. D.
Bakewell, chairman of the Australian
Woolgrowers Council, puts it: “It will be
grower-financed, but not grower-
controlled,” and because many growers
fear Government control of their indus-
try.
Whom has the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment been listening to? Canberra
and London are both overpopulated
with planners who can’t leave things
alone. The Commonwealth should
go no further, for the time being,
than to support the idea. Short
of some totally unexpected develop-
ment, the chances of a wool-price collapse
in the foreseeable future are remote. And
Mr. McEwen will find it very hard to
refute the charge, already being made,
that Canberra is burning to get its hands
on wool. He belongs to a Government
which was elected, among other reasons,
because a majority of Australians believed
that it stood for fewer, not more, controls,
A Test For Liberalism.
It will be interesting to see what happens
to Arthur Rollo, a 43-year-old seaman
who was forced to leave his ship in
Sydney because he refused to subscribe
to New Zealand strike funds or to the
World Youth Movement, both Com-
munist-sponsored.
Rollo , made no bones about his
opinions of Communists and all their
works when refusing to dub up. The
rest of the crew refused to sail the ship
from Sydney to Mackay unless Rollo left
within 48 hours. The captain said he
was helpless, shook hands with the “out-
cast” and wished him goodbye.
Then the Queensland Liberals heard
about it. The St. Lucia section promptly
sent letters to all Liberal M-H.Rs.
and to their State branch, demand-
ing action, saying: “It is up to the party,
having won the election on the Com-
munist issue, to stand up for the man
who has the courage to stick to his prin-
ciples.”
It got to Prime Minister Menzies,
from him to Deputy P.M. Fadden, who
asked Shipping Minister Senator McLeay
to “investigate,” Whom Senator McLeay
passed it on to isn’t stated, but it will be
interesting to see what happens.
Growing Old with Uncle Joe.
Thanks to the diligent research work of
Soviet scholars, it is now common know-
ledge that the world has Russian genius
to thank for most of the inventions that
make life worth living—as well as for
many of those which make it almost
insupportable. It was a Russian who
invented the telephone, the steam-engine,
the cinematograph, wireless, the internal-
combustion engine; Russians took the
first photographs, printed the first books,
broadcast the first radio programme, took
the first peep at the moon through the
first telescope, fired the first bullet out of
the first gun, and, of course, split the first
atom. Anyone with access to the files of
“Pravda” will be able to add to the list
almost indefinitely, even without including
such “musts” as the first tin-opener and
the first corkscrew.
It says much for the honesty of Soviet
scholars and the broadmindedness of the
Politbureau that, although most of these
inventions date back to before the start
of the Soviet regime, no attempt has been
made to conceal that fact. This is in
strong contrast to the attitude of their
Romanoff predecessors. Under the Tsars
no effort was spared to conceal from the
Russian people the fact that all these
inventions were the work of their fellow-
countrymen ; indeed, the idea was assidu-
ously cultivated that they had originated
in other countries. It was hoped that in
this way the Russian people would
develop feelings of inferiority and thus

make simpler the task of keeping them in
subjection. Fortunately Comrade Stalin
saw through the devilish plot; hence the
Revolution.
Recently Soviet researchers have turned
their attention to other fields of study,
and last month “Pravda” quoted a
“longevity-expert,” Professor Nagorny, as
saying that people lived much longer in
Russia than in capitalist countries. The
professor’s researches were made more
difficult by the fact that the Tsars, for
similar reasons to those quoted before,
neglected to keep thorough records of
births and deaths.
Still, despite this attempt to sabotage
the work of Soviet longevity-specialists,
Professor Nagorny has found that the
U.S.S.R. at the present time possesses
30,000 centenarians. They’re an assorted
lot, varying in age from mere youngsters
who have just notched their hundredth
birthday to Vassily Sergeivitch Tishkin,
who is preparing to celebrate his 145th.
Vassily has a young wife, rising 95, and
he still earns an honest crust by working
on a collective farm. Surprisingly, he
has a white beard.
Runner-up to Vassily is Makhmud
Eivasov, a mere 142, and just getting into
his stride—last year he was elected to the
rural Soviet in his native district of Lerik
in Azerbaijan. It is safe to say that
when, in the year 1809, Madame Eivasov
presented her husband with a bouncing
baby boy, neither of the proud parents
dreamed that 141 years later the puny
infant would attain the status of a shire-
councillor, and present to the youth of
the district a shining example of what
can be achieved in 14 decades of diligent
devotion to duty.
Like Vassily, Makhmud works on a
collective farm. The Soviet does not con-
sider age a disqualification from work;
under the effete capitalist system both old
gentlemen would probably be forced to
drag out a miserable existence on the
old-age pension.
This is possibly what Professor Nagorny
has in mind when he says that there exists
in Soviet Russia favorable conditions for
extending life while in capitalist countries
“there are very few examples of such
longevity.” Apart from that, the pro-
fessor advances no explanation for
Russia’s high percentage of ancients, but
as the U.S.S.R. did not come into exist-
ence until 1917 it is obvious that the
prime requirement of a Soviet centenarian
is that he shall have lived at least two-
thirds of his life under the Tsars.
POLITICAL POINTS
Probably the most disillusioned man in
the “Labor” party at the present moment
is Arthur Calwell, who convinced himself
and anyone else he could get to listen
that after a double-dissolution “Labor”
couldn’t possibly score worse than a
30-30 result. From the beginning of the
Senate count it was obvious that the Gov-
ernment would win six seats in Queens-
land and at least 31 in the six States.
Final counting in Westrajia gave the
Menzies-Fadden team six in that State
also, and the new Senate will consist of
32 Government supporters and 28
‘Labor,”
Calwell’s estimate did not allow for an
anti-“ Labor” vote of the proportion
attained in Queensland. In both States
where the Government won six seats it
had the advantage of first place on the
ballot-paper. In the West, where the
margin above the sixth quota was very
small, first-place was definitely the decid-
ing factor, but in Queensland the Govern-
ment would probably have succeeded even
without that help,
Saturday will see by-elections in two
States —for the Burwood seat in the N. S.
Wales Assembly and for Flinders in the
S.A. ditto. No fireworks expected; the
late Mr. Jackett held Burwood for the
Libs by a comfortable majority and R.
W. Pearson, who resigned Flinders to
join the Government Senate team, was
unopposed in 1950 and more than doubled
his opponent’s figures at the previous
election. There’ll be a Federal by-election
in Victoria some time next month —to
fill the Balaklava seat, left vacant by the
appointment of Tommy White as High
Commissioner in London. The Liberal
party has called for nominations and is
enlarging its letterbox to cope with the
rush.
Communist Stan Moran, of the Sydney
watersiders, told a Domain mob that “no
ship in the world would take Healy out
of Australia.” Doesn’t he realise that this
is an age of air travel?
Under Red tutelage the coalminers first
turned down the Gallagher attendance
bonus and staged strikes in protest
against it. Then they accepted it “under
protest,” saying they would not let it
interfere with “their traditional rights.”
No sooner had this been done than a
batch of them at Wallamaine struck
because they alleged some of their
members had been wrongfully refused
the bonus. In other words, it goes
against their grain to accept money for
not striking, but they’ll strike if they
don’t get it
Duggan, Queensland Transport
Minister, has announced from New York
that “four weeks in the United States
has convinced me that Queensland must
have diesel-powered trains.” A few hours
in a Queensland train should have done
the convincing at much less expense.
Bourke, “Labor” M.H.R. for Fawkner
(Vic.), has suggested an all-party com-
mittee to consider methods of remedying
glaring defects in the Constitution. Fair
enough, but not far enough. Represen-
tatives of the States should also be in-
cluded in a full-scale convention with the
object of completely overhauling the Con-
stitution, not merely patching up the
more obvious holes.
“If, during the past six years, the
Socialists had devoted as much energy to
promoting plenty as they have to con-
trolling scarcity, there would have been
much less scarcity to control.” —Henry
Price, British M.P.
Premier Hanlon is getting out of step.
He told a radio audience:
There are no good fairies to wave magic
wands and conjure up material prosperity.
Only by honest toil and sweat can progress
be achieved; Fortune gives no handouts.
That’s plain commonsense, but it is a
long time since a “Labor” politician
voiced such advice. The general picture
they have held out to the electors is that
the State is a fairy godmother with access
to a bottomless purse.
After four Victorian racing clubs had
urged the McDonald-Cains to legalise
ofl-the-course betting. Premier Mc-
Donald told a deputation of clergymen
that he couldn’t suppress s.p. betting,
which was “even spreading to school-
children” and that “a law which the
people will not respect is a bad law.”
The answer to that is that a law is use-
less unless it is enforced —s.p. laws are
not. What the State Governments have
to decide is whether they can risk their
political hides by enforcing them.
A social scientist tested the gullibility
of the American public recently by stand-
ing a pretty girl on a street-comer with a
collection-box and a notice stating
“Give. Three-headed orphans of
claustrophobia. This is a fake.” Of 264
people who stopped, 155 dropped money
into the box, one woman saying with
tears in her eyes, “I was an orphan my-
self.” Australians aren’t quite as gullible
as that, or are they? Look at the money
some of them drop into the collection-
boxes of the Communist-dominated
unions!
There’s a family quarrel going on in
Victoria over the transport of equipment
to the brown-coal town, Yallourn. Much
of this has apparently been going by road,
and the Railways department wants to
know why. Last week the State
Electricity Commission gave several
reasons ; Railways Commissioner Wis-
hart said they were all wrong. The
problem seems simple enough; all the
railways have to do is prove they can
handle the goods more cheaply or more
expeditiously than road-transport and the
S.E.C. won’t have a leg to stand on.
On the plea that “inescapable addi-
tional costs” in the past year will be
almost £11,000,000, P.M.G. Anthony
hinted that the public could expect in-
creased postal and telegraph charges and
telephone rents shortly. But are all those
additional costs inescapable?
When it was discovered that the Vic-
torian Egg Board chairman was also its
manager, at another £lOOO a year and

berry industry, McDonald promised a
“full-scale investigation” and Cain yelled
that he wouldn’t rest until he got a Royal
Commission. It all began when some-
body alleged that a recently-appointed
manager was a Red and he was shot out.
Meantime Vic. housewives have to part

On May 10 an Opposition member in
the N. S. Wales Parliament suggested that
on May 24 the Assembly should post-
pone its meeting until after lunch to en-
able members to accept invitations to
attend Empire Day celebrations at
schools. McGirr replied that the House
would meet at 11 a.m., that he was pre-
pared to exempt from attendance any
member of the Opposition who wished
to attend a function, and that “Govern-
ment members will be present to attend
to their Parliamentary duties.” At 11 p.m.
on May 23 Opposition members were
informed that on the morrow the House
would not meet until after lunch. “S. M.
Herald’s” Column Eight described Mc-
Grrrr’s action as “very petty.” So it
was, but “Granny” should know that the
McGrrrrs have no respect for any tradi-
tion that is not the exclusive property
of “Labor.” On the fiftieth anniversary
of the opening of the Federal Parlia-
ment the N. S. Wales Government staged
a function at Parliament House, Among
the guests-of-honor was a gentleman
whose distinction was that he was a
“Labor” member of the State House for
one term about 10 years before Federa-
tion. No invitations were sent to the

With nearly 300 of Sydney’s 700 buses
out of commission through a strike of
Amalgamated Engineering Union
mechanics described by Transport
Minister Sheahan as part of a Com-
munist plan to destroy the arbitration
system—4s,ooo people on bus-routes had
to get to work on Monday as best they
could. On the way there they could
ponder on a newspaper headline:
“Special Buses for Hawkesbury Races.”
Gloria Foley, 27-year-old daughter of
the Queensland Lands Minister, who
defied the Czech Communists to fulfil a
musical scholarship she’d won in Prague,
and has just managed to get out of the
place, told reporters at Fremantle that
“The Communists threatened me with
imprisonment, tapped my telephone and
photographed my mail.” Police “almost
lived on her doorsteps.” Well, the lady
can now cheer up, being safely back
home, and if she cares to wander into
Sydney Municipal Library she can study
bound copies of “Czechoslovakia Today”
and see pictures of a deliriously happy
people and read, in good English, articles
telling Australians bow grand life is under
Communism.
Much will undoubtedly be said in the
Federal caucus-room of “Labor’s” poor
showing at the last election, but one
“Labor” man, J. C. Gralton, president
of the Gosford (N.S.W.) branch of the
A.L.P., has already given his reasons for
the party’s failure. He places the blame
“right at the door of the words and
actions of Mr. Chifley, Dr. Evatt and the
Federal A.L.P.” Getting down to details,
he blames Chifley for saying “our job
was done and we ought to leave Korea.”
Evatt’s disastrous foreign policy he con-
siders largely responsible for the Dutch
being forced out of Java and for our
losing “the protection of Manus.” “But
the biggest blow to Labor stalwarts was
Dr. Evatt’s appearance in wig and gown
for the Communists.”
These things were, of course, all said
by Government speakers and newspaper
critics before the election ; Chifley and
Evatt described them as “a smear cam-
paign.” A majority of the electors
thought otherwise, and, according to
Gralton, a lot of people inside the
“Labor” party think otherwise, too.
He cites as the thing that made a
“Labor” debacle certain the action of the
executive in ordering opposition to the
secret ballot, which “the majority of Aus-
tralians want.” Gralton will probably
be up on the mat for his outspoken
criticism, but he’ll have lots of supporters.
A Sydney columnist announces that the
McGirr Transport Department is start-
ing a “staff journal” and there will be a
£5 prize for the best title. In view of
the dangerous shortage of newsprint, the
muddle of Sydney’s road transport and
the £8 million quid lost in the past year,
an apt title seems to be; “Suspended
Animation.”
Federal Parliament opens on June 12.
On the 18th there will be a meeting of
the Loan Council, and the Prime Minister
will probably use the occasion to make
formal request to the Premiers for
transfer to the Commonwealth of power
to deal with the Reds.
N.Z. “Labor” party, after a months-
long hesitation on the Communist
wharfies’ blockade of Maoriland, now
comes out with the charge that the

union rebels. The truth is that the
Commos and their supporters set out to
starve the community.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“C.Q.”: A Victorian housing official
said the other day that prefabricated
houses had come to stay. On the other
hand, a prefab, expert says that they are
so easy to put up and to remove, and
architectural styles are so ephemeral, that
he has no doubt that in a few years it will
be possible for owners to change their
model, like they do their cars. All they
will have to do is to ring up a firm and
offer to trade in their old model and a
new one will be on the spot in a few
hours. I have just been watching one
of Melbourne’s old boom palaces in
Toorak being demolished. Its architec-
ture is not remarkable, but the solidity
of its construction would stagger a
modern builder. It has foundations of
enormous blocks of dressed bluestone,
walls four bricks thick, 16ft. ceilings and
an enormous bluestone cellar which
would cost as much to build nowadays
as a modern dwelling. The bricks are

“Ajax”: It may be true that La Belle
Jennings, sister of the first Duchess of
Marlborough, became a member of the
Order of Poor Clares, and later Mother
Superior of a convent of that Order in
Ireland, but she certainly did not found
the Order, as “Curate’s Egg” (B.
16/5/’5l) claims. The Order was
founded in Italy in J 212 by St. Clara,
under the influence of St. Francis of
Assisi, whose ideal of evangelical poverty
was adopted as the basis of their Rule.
The nuns became the “Second Order of
St. Francis,” the friars (known as Fran-
ciscans) being the First Order. The
Franciscans are established in Brisbane,
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and
Townsville, and have the special assign-
ment of looking after the spiritual welfare
of the New Australians. The Poor
Clares crossed to England about 1293
and established themselves in London,
outside Aldgate, where their name of
Mjnoresses survives in the Minories. The
nuns now on their way to Australia will
found the first convent of the Order
here.

“Hoppy”: I have pushed my way into
stadiums from W.A. to Townsville to
watch the boys at work under the haze
of tobacco smoke tainted with odors of
pies and pasties. The yells and wise-
cracks are seldom refreshing, possibly
because the fans are too weighed down
under the burden of their bets. How I
revelled in a “noight at foights” in the
North of Ireland! Being an Aussie, I
was found a seat
near the ring
notable for its
absence of boiled
shirts, and soon it
was evident that
the crowd wanted
plenty of action.
The prelims were
satisfactory for
all, with blood
and knockdowns bringing torrents of
comments above the usual roars
from the distant rear. Then came
the big event. After a couple of fairly
dull rounds there was a lull as the
maulers leant against each other. From
near me a voice suggested: “Put out the
lights and let ’em have an honest kiss.”
Floating down from the bleachers high-
pitched tones protested: “Och, let those
lights be ; cannot yer see Oi’m reading
my paper?”

“Hillbilly”; There are some queer
spots around this Australia. Travelling
east to Victoria I found it cost 7s. 6d.
to store the family luggage for a couple
of hours in Adelaide—two-bob to a
“redcap” to truck the stuff up the incline
to the cloak-room ; 3s. 6d. to cloak seven
parcels; then another two-bob to
“Reddy” to cart the load down to the
Melbourne train. In Melbourne I nearly
got lumbered through trying to retrieve
the trunks from a loaded truck, having in
hillbilly innocence tossed the goods into
the guard’s-van at Ballarat. Lengthy
explanations, production of tickets, veri-
fication of name on trunk-labels at last
secured release of self and luggage.
Three months later, arriving at
Kalgoorlie (W.A.), I was instructed,
along with 100 other passengers—“ Just
leave your luggage on the platform, it’ll
be all right.” Returning four hours later
surprised Eastern-Staters found that it
was so. Queer place Kalgoorlie!

“Angus Bob”: Too old at 65 (B.
9/5/’51)? I wonder if “Laetitia” has
heard of Surgeon-Rear-Admiral John
Reid Muir, R.N. (retd.), author of The
Life and Achievements, of Captain James
Cook, published in 1939. This gallant
gentleman was killed by enemy action at
the age of 68, while serving as a
lieutenant in the R.N.V.R. early in World
“Oh dear! The power must have come on again !”
War 11, Added to his professional
ability, Muir was a first-rate seaman.
He held a master’s certificate, and was
navigating-officer of a large yacht
requisitioned by the Admiralty, in which
he eventually met his death. Geoffrey
Shakespeare, then Secretary of the
Admiralty, said in a speech that there
was an Admiralty patrol-vessel with four
commissioned officers whose united ages
came to 280 years. John Reid Muir,
navigating-officer, was the youngest of
these.
“Apple Isle”: A bloke in the Speck,
forced to retire from the public service
at 65, started work with a private firm,
and was with them for the next 20 years.
He retired then and built himself a
dinghy. After that, when he was pushing
90, he tackled a boatshed. If he’d
downed tools at 65 he would probably
not have lived much over his three-score-
and-ten: many men die from sheer
boredom-

“Teasy”; John Doe (B. 16/5/’5l) is
a survival of the English law which pre-
vailed in the Thirteen Colonies in America
prior to 1776. Procedures now obsolete
even in N.S.W. are still up to date in
Kansas city. In the 18th century Sir
Arthur would not demean himself by
taking Hon. Herbert Bright-Plumag© to
court. A duel was the proper way for
gentlemen to settle their differences.
British compromise found a way to make
court proceedings respectable by solemnly
citing an artificial plaintiff—always “John
Doe,” or “John Doe and others”—and an
equally false defendant, “Richard Roe. ’

“Clooter”: A terrible fellow named
Greig has been unearthed in Coventry
(Eng.). Victim of a secret vice, he got
away with it for nearly four years, was
discovered, confessed and was suspended.
Then, in the true fashion of the times,
trouble followed; Greig was a band-
master, and 20 of his 38 bandsmen
downed bassoons, euphoniums and
French-horns. That it was a Salvation
Army band and that Greig, like the rest,
had signed a pledge not to drink, swear,
smoke, go to the pictures and football
matches, and had been caught smoking
in secret, is beside the point; which is,
that if this sort of thing spreads there’ll
be bottles in the belfries, vestas in the
vestries, and even the Sunday-school
superintendent may give vent to a feeling
damn when the little devils get on his
nerves, and fear nought, knowing that if
the elders out him most of the teachers
and half the pupils will down tools. Such
is the dreadful precedent set in Coventry,
which no doubt knows now why it was
visited with flame and smoke so fre-
quently in the not so long ago.

“Findy”: When to take the plunge into
the first pair of long-’uns is a problem
in every boy’s life. From the parental
point of view, in these days when a lad’s
clothes cost more than his father’s used
to, there is a tendency to postpone the
step. One high-school lad pestered his
parents to buy him long strides —all the
boys were wearing them. Cross-examined,
he reduced his estimate to half the boys
and, finally, to about one in six. Dad
decided he could wait a little longer.
Then there was a change in tactics.
There were a couple of vacancies on the
prefect list; as a kid in shorts he couldn’t
hope to compete with other contenders
who rejoiced in the dignity of long pants.
Couldn’t he get long-’uns “for best,” and
just wear them to school for a week or so
until the prefects were chosen? That
seemed fair enough, so Dad came across,
and sure enough the prefecture came
son’s way. Dad let a week or so pass,
then reminded the lad of his contract,
suggesting a back-to-shorts move. “Can't
do that,” protested the lad. “Now I’m a
prefect I have to wear long-’uns.”

“Villefair”: At one time white-painted
scrolls with skewer attachment used to
proclaim in butcher-shop windows the
price of the cuts they spiked. Now they
naively state: “Choice lamb chops,”
“Prime leg lamb” and so on. The one
that rocked me, however, bore a Union
Jack painted in red above the order:
“Neck chops. Eat more lamb.” My
mentality can’t fully comjprehend the
subtle reminder of patriotic duty, but
apparently, if I were an Anglophobe
intent on assisting to wreck the Empire,
I could achieve that end by traitorously
eating beef. On the other hand, by
steadily gorging huge quantities of lamb
I would be manfully shouldering my
responsibilities to keep the flag aloft.
It’s an aspect I had never considered
before, and it raises another thought:
When I ask for lamb, pay for lamb and
receive the inevitable mutton, am I not
only loosening my teeth and ruining my
digestion but also undermining the
Empire?

“Ben Ari”: Those a.w.l. Diggers! Ray
Whiting and “Schoolie” have presented
a couple of angles on soldier-detection,
but possibly the most obvious and posi-
tive method (especially during the
summer) was the chinstrap mark on the
sunburnt face. I can vouch for the effec-
tiveness of this when, dressed in my
Sunday civvies, I ill-advisedly entered
Perth one war-time afternoon. Hawk-
eyed M.Ps. moved menacingly my way,
resulting in unequal chase. I lost, of
course!

“Min Min” : The wine industry strikes
grievous obstacles even where goodwill
abounds. The casual diner at the country
hotel was a military man. Three pips
denoted his rank and a row of ribbons
his achievements. The waitress waved a
fly-spotted menu,
“Wotcher havin’?
Roast or corn?”
she complained.
With a possible
eye to safety-first
he decided on
corn, and asked
for a wine-list.
She came out of
her trance, sus-
picion darkening her brow. “I don t
think the boss’ll stand for boozing m
the dining-room,” she warned, as she
trailed to an open door. “Mike,” she
trilled. “There’s a bloke here wants plonk
with his tea. Eh? No, he’s not full.
She wandered back. “You can have it
but you’ll have to go round to the bar
and get it. I’m too busy. What? It
don’t matter? Well, wotcher wanter take
up me time for?”
LEAVES OF GRASS.
“An English migrant tost in scrub country 381
miles west of Brisbane lived on wattle-leaves and
brackish water for 48 hours.”
Beans and peas are going down,
The middleman has hit the bottle;
Word is getting round the town:
“British migrants live on wattle.”
Fruiterers’ wives are in a passion,
Tearing hair and rending sables —
“If leaves are coming into fashion,
Who will buy our vegetables?”
Sackclothed potatoes contemplate
Sepulchral ash with brooding looks;
The turnip mourns his grower’s fate —
A wretched turnip for the books;.
Our age of cars will see car-rot;
The cab-age, too, will soon be gone,
Wept by the onion and shallot,
The more, because they weep alone.
Meanwhile Australia’s bushland hums
With swarms of lovers of The Free,
Sinking their teeth into their gums,
And taking tea-trees home to tea:
There, outstretched palms are never tipped,
And no greengrocer calls you thief,
Where teas proceed with Flora stripped
Without so much as buy-your-leaf.
It cannot last. Some law will pass,
Racked out of some political cranium,
Protecting trees, shrubs, leaves and grass,
The rose, nasturtium and geranium:
If winds were rich in food and fat,
It’s likely—such our time’s perversity—
Some tycoon, spiv or bureaucrat
Would somehow organise their scarcity.

the next world is supernatural time can

Lady Binney heard saying “It’s a quarter-
past eleven” has been laid. A caretaker
has invited Lady Binney to listen any
time a certain wind is blowing and the

“Hamer”: There was no ghost in pos-
session of Hobart Government House (B.
16/5/’5l) some 50-odd years ago when,
“Hullo, Gorgeous —where've you been lately?"
for a brief period, I stayed there; and
my own opinion is that no self-respecting
ghost would regard the place as big
enough for haunting. My hosts were the
Doddses ; he was Chief Justice and Lieut.-
Governor. One of my most joyful recol-
lections is of how, with other guests, I
assisted the servants to drive the cows
off the lawn so that it could be prepared
for the garden-party in honor of the
birthday of Queen Victoria, Hobart is
the only vice-regal residence known to me
in which such pastoral simplicity has
been associated with a State occasion.

“Exdig”: At the end of the Kaiser’s
war I spent some time making precis of
unit war diaries. It was interesting work,
and I feel it gave me an insight into the
characters of some of the Army higher-
ups. A general officer who particularly
appealed to me was concerned about the
availability of grog for his troops when
they came out of the line. His splurge
of indignation when he found his men
brought back to an area where the plonk
had been virtually all mopped up and
vin blanc leapt to six francs a bottle was
a fine bit of English. Another chap to
whom my heart was drawn was a brig-
adier with a capacity for being sarcastic
to higher authority. Said one of his
memos: “I would be glad if memos from
h.q. could be more exact. Yesterday I
received a signal saying that I was being
sent an intelligent officer for my staff;
today I find, on this officer reporting, that
an intelligence officer was intended —a
very different thing.”

“Pontius Penwiper”: The craze for
speed has got its latest Australian
example in an entire family which paid
expensively to shoot round the world in
17 days. They gave ’Frisco a single day.
New York four and London a week. Of
course, they saw little but the interior
of the vehicles in which they slithered
about from place to place; they mi"ht
have got as much intelligent satisfaci m
by shooting round a circle in a speed-car
covering the same distances. Yet the
restless desire for speed has gripped even
those of us who would never be foolish
enough to go upon excursions such as
these. In my younger days services on
many tram-routes were half-hourly; in
some cases even less frequent. We
studied the times, and if my parents failed
to contact some conveyance on the due
time they were unperturbed, but waited
placidly for the extra half an hour or
so. Today, when I reach the spot where
I intend to catch a tram, I am fidgety
if the vehicle has not arrived in two
or three minutes, ramping if it does not
come in five, and boiling over with
remarks about inefficient transport if
compelled to wait 10 minutes.

“Ike Hollar”: “Doric’s” wife (B.
16/5/’5l) may have been wrong in
criticising the “padded shoulders” of a
man in one case; but padded shoulders
are a common masculine vanity nowa-
days. When they first arrived they were
scornfully known as “Yankee shoulders,”
and most Australians regarded with con-
tempt those males who tried to give an
artificial pretence to naturally sloping
shoulders. I was myself one of the
scorners; but in a few years tailors were
putting in the pads as a matter of course.
The shoulders are not the only padded
parts of some males’ outfit. An actor I
knew had a complete set of pads which,
among other things, filled out his lean
shanks and fitted him to be a stalwart
stage hero. One of the drawbacks was
that his stage clothes, tailored to cover
his paddings, were no use for ordinary
wear without them.
HORRIFIC PROSPECT.
“A medical authority asserts that women’s hands
are becoming larger and they are developing arm-
muscles, and considers this will become increasingly
apparent as the result of their invading fields of
employment formerly regarded only as man’s.”
Your poet, short-cashed and long-haired,
Once penned in his cold draughty attic
(He much preferred .easements
To windows in basements)
Apostrophes long and ecstatic
To hands which he often compared
With flowers so dainty and tenuous.
How could he be knowing
They’d some day be growing
Through muscular work much too strenuous?
Take the case in La Vie de Boheme.
Rodolfo, that verse-maker dreamy,
Would scarcely have chosen
That “tiny” hand frozen
While holding the mitt of his Mimi
If, instead of the sewing, her game
Had been swinging a seven-pound hammer.
If her grip had him wincing
Would that be convincing
That she’d irresistible glamor?
For the writer of mushy romance —
In the light of such modern transitions —
The need is arising
To do some revising
To old and established traditions
When his heroine’s been “wounded by glance”
From a jealous impetuous lover.
And sobbing’s quite “racked her”
Remember this factor:
Her face with one hand she can cover!
If you now get a whang on the back
That’s given to you in a manner
Which buckles your knees and
Nigh fractures your weasand,
Like somebody using a spanner,
Don’t think it’s a sudden attack
By a tough out to give you a beating—
It’s simply that Maisie
Or Shirley or Daisy
Is giving you jocular greeting.
Soon, in sport, the big hammer they’ll throw
Instead of just playing at tennis.
Then our he-girls with muscles
And big red corpuscles
Will really become quite a menace;
For when their affection they show,
Their quondam demureness forsaking,
Their “blokes” they’ll be squeezing
And soon have ’em wheezing
And, likely, some ribs they’ll be breaking!

ABORIGINALITIES
“Gravelsnatcher”; The rains came, the
seeds sprang to life and green appeared.
The rains continued while the roots de-
veloped, then they ceased, and for the
last month we’ve seen hardly a cloud.
Meanwhile, the grass is living and grow-
ing, but a wilting at midday indicates
the struggle that is taking place in the
soil. Not for nothing has nature decreed
that, in most seeds, the root-system
springs first, to begin the great adventure
of seeking a foothold and sustenance on
this spinning globe. We see the foliage
and call that the plant, but the green
leaves are just the visible evidence of an
ages-old struggle for existence. By the
time the plant is 6in. high the roots have
thrust feet deep and have prospected in
every direction, feeding themselves and
the leaves, building up a force which can
propel sap up to the top of a 300 ft. tree
or along a 100-yard vine. That force is
something which man cannot copy. It’s
the source of all life, and it begins in
those tiny roots which now are fighting
for life amongst the particles of soil,
seeking the mineral-holding film which
surrounds the apparently dry grain of
earth. As the aridity descends so do
the roots, but, while they’ll find the
moisture to retain life, the nutriment in
the topsoil is largely denied them. If
the rain holds off for another fortnight
the grasses in my paddocks will know the
meaning of drought, but they’ll battle on
to spring refreshed after the next rain.
“ Don't forget — you'll have to book in as Mister and Missus now."
Plants are the source of all life; maybe
they’re the source of inspiration, too.

“8.A.K.”: That young Austrian who
was digging the trench for Heth (B.
9/5/’sl) was a pretty good toiler, but
Old Jack would give him 25 years and a
solid testing. Of course, the young
fellow would have an advantage in that
he is ambidextrous —he changed hands
four times in six drawings—but it would
be offset by his lack of experience in
selecting a “mad-mick” with a “set” on
it like an anchor. Jack, on the other
hand, comes from the old school; he
knows every point—except poling. It
should be a match worth watching—if
Old Jack wasn’t so averse to being
watched. Thirty-three years as a pick-
and-shoveller haven’t made the veteran
accept the inevitable; he still won’t
concede that a man in a hole is naturally
and automatically “Exhibit A.” Pedes-
trians with nothing better to do than
watch honest blokes work exasperate
him; but drivers of motor-vehicles
really get his rag out. As he sees it:
“You’ve got a hole in the side of the
road and you’re down to your chin. All
of a sudden there’s a ‘whoosh’ and a
whirr ; you look up quick and wheels are
flyin’ round about 7in. from y’r eyes.
You feel the wind off ’em and they
seem to be suckin’ you unde*". You see
the ground on the edge of the hole bulge
out, and sometimes, if it’s a heavy truck,
the back wheels slip towards y’ as the
tar crumbles. The driver has nearly all
the road, but he’s got to get close enough
to have a stickybeak. But here’s the
funny part: when the hole’s filled in,
nothin’ on the road will come within
yards—in case they sideslip in! ”

splashes of muddy water tell a tale of
happy association. Most mornings Patch
enjoys two succulent eggs obligingly sup-
plied by her feathered friends, while they,
with waggling tails and jerking necks, look
on with mild interest at, even approval
of, this scoffing of their embryo offspring.

“Kelms”: There were butterflies in
hundreds, but something peculiar about
one that alighted in front of me prompted
investigation. Its oddity was apparent —
it had no abdomen. Its body was sheared
off just behind the wings, making its
flight awkward and at the mercy of the
breeze, but beyond that it seemed in-
different to its loss. A casual search soon
revealed several more similarly afflicted,
and, while 1 can advance no reason for
their mutilation other than an attack by
some enemy—perhaps a praying-mantis —
their apparent lack of concern seems to
support the theory that insects don’t feel
pain. There is considerable evidence to
support this. Wasps whose wings have
been removed by a sharp instrument
continued to attempt to lift objects, paring
them down after each unsuccessful
attempt, obviously unaware that they had
lost their wings; another wasp, whose
abdomen had been accidentally removed,
continued to feed on a syrup, although
the rood simply passed through what was
left of its body and dropped to the
"No—the one on the LEFT is the tenor."
ground. It would starve to death, still
gorging itself, quite unaware that it had
suffered a mortal injury.

“Solitude”: We were on our way to
the top run, and for hours had ridden
through steady sleet. Seventyfiver broke
a long silence. “How about you checkin’
on that next gully, Sol, then we’ll eat
under these wattles ’ere?” When I got
back he had pulled a horse-rug over a
couple of branches and dragged the packs
underneath. Also under the shelter were
the two dogs and half his nag, while on
the remaining inches the old bloke labored
over a few sticks that for their size pro-
duced a surprising amount of smoke. I
threw a bag over my saddle, slipped my
nag’s bit, and edged in with a handful of
bark from under my coat, “Have we
got to have the blasted moke inside?” I
growled as Seventyfiver crawled between
its legs, shoved Blue aside, and salvaged
the tucker-bag. “Well, it’s ’is rug,” came
the defence. “Anyway, stop y’r shiverin’,
can’t y’, or y’ll bring the lot down on us.”
Eventually the billy boiled. Seventyfiver
lifted it on to my foot, seated himself
on a yelping mong and shoved his wet
boots almost in my face. “Y’ know, Sol,
it don’t take that long t’ put it up,” he
remarked, propping himself against the
nag’s leg and admiring his handiwork
overhead. “An’ we might just as well
eat in comfort.”

“Chuck”; To date I haven’t struck a
radio- or film-work in Australian setting
that rings true. Granted, it is difficult.
For instance, Dad, when presented With
the danger of a bushfire, doesn’t rush
round everywhere telling the world about
it in a loud voice, and swallowing
copious draughts of tea against the shock.
Nor does Mum’s voice quiver dramatically
at every gratitude, nor sob with every
threatened mishap. But Dad’s muttered
curse as he strides grimly for his nag
wouldn’t do for radio, and Mum clench-
ing her jaw and gazing silently at the
wash-up water wouldn’t make any sort of
hearing. Maybe I’m too critical. I
watched one Australian film, and heard
all round me comments of praise. The
man in the next seat didn’t see anything
wrong with the appearance of the hard-
ridden nag ; he didn’t know that poisoned
animals, so conveniently grouped for the
camera, wouldn’t lie quite like that; and
he didn’t recognise the resentment and
uneasiness in the behavior of bush
animals that were supposedly in their
native surroundings. Good entertain-
ment, I dare say, for cities and overseas,
but I’m an outbacker.

“Mat’s Mate”: We were sitting sun-
ning ourselves on Adelaide’s North
Terrace when a bustling sort of cove
breezed up and said “Ain’t I seen you
coves before?” Mat eyed him. “Could
be,” he admitted; “me an’ the mate here
knock about a fair bit, an’ we can’t be
always watchin’t’ see who sees us.” The
cove laughed in a doubtful sort of way
and said “Was it up in Mildoora?” “It
might ha’ bin,” Mat conceded. “A lot
o’ funny things happen in Mildoora.”
The cove was a bit dashed by this,
muttered something about having to get
along, then he suddenly fixed me with a
stern eye and demanded “Ain’t youse
the blokes was camped on that road job
just out o’ Lang Lang?’’ Before I could
answer. Mat leaned across me and
peered up the Terrace. “Hey,” he
whispered, in a nervous tone loud enough
to reach our interlocutor, “there’s that
blasted copper watchin’ us again. I told
y’ they’d find that bloke we done over
last night. This town’s too small t’ get
away with it. We better” He stopped,
bent a keen look on the bustling cove
and said “Look, we was with you, last
night, mate, see? If that copper”
But by that time the b.c, was half-way up
Gawier-place and putting on speed.
Then we sat back and enjoyed the sun
in peace.

“Bo”: The hoodless car of a make long
passed into oblivion, its seat-springs
bulging through the broken leather-work,
chugged up and stopped outside the store
in the only street of the little township,
and the little old bloke got out of the
driver’s seat and proceeded to let all the
tyres down. Having done which he
groped under the front seat, took out the
tyre-pump and was walking with it to-
wards the door of the store when Evans,
the storekeeper, appeared. “G’day,
Josh,” he greeted. “Saw y’ through the
window lettin’ y’r tyres down. Giving
’em a spell after their run in?
“No, it ain’t that,” returned Josh
seriously. “But I bin readin’ in a
Melbourne paper lately there’s a big gang
o’ car-thieves operatin’. I can’t lock mine
up, y’ know, an’ I ain’t got it insured.”

“Bad Australian”: The eerie hush that
is sometimes experienced on areas subject
to seismic disturbances (B. 9/5/’5l) is a
fairly reliable indication of the imminence
of a more-or-less violent ’quake. During
a residence of 15 years in the Andine
regions of South America I experienced
many seismic disturbances, from the
barely perceptible tremor to the nerve-
shaking heave of the earth underfoot.
Those convulsions usually occurred m
normal weather under a perfectly clear
sky and were almost invariably preceded
by that depressing silence; when, as in
those regions, the ’quake is accompanied
by the frantic stampede of hundreds oi
mules and the terrified shrieks and prayers
of the people by whom the catastrophe
is regarded as a manifestation of the
wrath of God directed solely against
them, the effect is vivid. Mules are more
sensitive to the influence of seismic dis-
turbances than any animal I know; ours
always sensed an impending
several minutes before we felt the hrst
tremor. Some of the natives of the
Higher Andes make surprisingly accurate
forecasts of seismic disturbances horns
before the quake occurs, but when ques-
tioned on the subject they appear unable
or unwilling to explain the facts or fancies
on which their forecasts are based.

“Mac Fergus”: Have I (and “The
Banjo”) been in error all these years m
ascribing the term “the ringer” to mean
the shearer with the highest tally.
According to a “gun” on the Condamme
(S.Q.) the ringer is the bloke who collet
the biggest cheque at the cut-out,
spective of his occupation. Submitting th
question to woolgrowers, agreed
“babbler” could ring the shed in the event
of a hold-up as a result of ram or other
cause when it was possible for the shea-
hand to take more money out than m
“gun.”
SUMMER MINIATURE,
WARRANDYTE.
Tumult of nations sinks to the cess of brawls —
Poor, human clappers swung in fatal bells —
Here, where life hangs from pinpoint spider’s
spool,
And death’s a stillness in a rain-left pool.
So much of sky, earth’s back is bent with light
Between road’s cliff and gum’s sun-sworded
height;
And forest-deep, hot-shimmering waves of air
Drown distance in a mirage, grey and fair.
But all unburdened by their strange man-names,
The “running postmen” move like scrabbling
flames,
Threatening ant-town’s citizens with flight;
Sundew’s malevolence squats in honeyed light.
Each has an angel’s pitiless immanence,
Signed and counter-signed through the gates of
sense;
Each earth-possessed, no tilth may their estate —
Curtilage, demesne or policy—abate.
As greenhood helmets under jousting airs
Falter and flutter amid grassy spears,
Remembered bellbirds are a thirst in the mind —
Though chinking unseen waters cool and kind.
About, about the elk-fern’s transient lace
Everlastings’ yellow winds a paperchase;
And, silent-bedded in a waste of moss,
The four-o’clocks close crimson time in loss.

‘Betcha”; The youth was new to the
bush, but taking a great interest in every-
thing* and learning fast. As he accom-
panied me round my trapline I pointed
out the position of some of the traps,
allowing him to remove the catch and
reset. “Hey, what’s this thing I’ve got?”
he yelled presently. “And what’ll I do
with it?” I glanced over the bank and
found him contemplating a silver-grey.
“Possum,” I grinned. “Grab him by
the tail close up, and let him out of the
trap. Better watch him. Then let him
go on that tree there.” “Let him go!
Doesn’t do us any good, does he?”
“Doesn’t do us any harm, either,” I said
sternly, following it with a lecture on
possum-lore, and the respect due to the
animals of the bush. The newchum was
impressed. “Suppose you’re right,” he
agreed. “They’ve got as much right to
live here as we have. Pity we caught this
poor little blighter, but he’ll be grateful,
getting let loose.” He was half-way to
the tree when the dogs, attracted by the
possum’s protests, dashed in eager for a
kill. I whistled, then roared, and the
youth, watching the dogs, forgot to keep
one eye on the possum. “I don’t know
much about these things yet,” he said,
“but I'll soon learn.” It was at that
second the silver-grey got his teeth into
the youth’s hand and a promising bush-
naturalist died at birth.

“Amdee”: I would give a tip to these
novelists who set their romantic tales in
the tropics, and in which castaways enjoy
the ambrosia of the liquid from green,
unripe coconuts. The nut at that stage
contains insipid water. Used for wash-
ing and shaving it lathers well. It is also
“One less mouth to feed , Marge.”
an excellent substitute for distilled water
in car batteries. A good drinking nut
should show a distinct bronze sheen
sparsely spotted with brown dots. At this
stage of development the meat of the
nut has formed, imparting a coconut
flavor to the clear liquid that has just
begun slight fermentation prior to chang-
ing into the familiar “milk” of the nut.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: The entire district had
been drenched with rain all night and the
water had continued falling steadily
throughout the day. In Trundle (N.S.W.)
men went about in oilskins, women in
nylon or rubber coats, cats stayed inside
and dogs shivered wetly on verandas.
Pools lay in the streets and backyards,
young seas were forming in the shallow
gullies, dams were filling, housetanks over-
flowing. Still the rain came down and, as
the day drew to a close, everybody pre-
pared for a wet night. On the road from
The Troffs appeared a shrouded figure
with a humped back. It tramped steadily
through the rain to the Union Hotel,
reached the veranda, partially unwrapped
itself to reveal that the bump was a swag,
dropped this against the wall, wiped rain
from its head and whiskers, then headed
for the bar with a fervent “Gripes, I’m
dry as a wooden god! ”

“Brick E.”: While the brickies were
working on the job the lady next door
never even offered a drop of hot water.
The chippies received no better treat-
ment. But the moment the plumbers
arrived afternoon-tea began to come
over the fence around about three
o’clock every day. The apprentice came
in for his share of chiacking over it,
because he was always the one
summoned to accept the refreshments,
and a girl about his age often visited
the house and was heard to call the lady
“Auntie.” It looked as though the traps
were out. But we were wrong. When
the embryo plumber was adequately
“softened up” the
lady came round to
it: She hated to
bother him, but the
handle of her silver
teapot was pulling
away; did he think he
could stick it back,
somehow? Aw, he
thought he might be
able to solder it back.
And that’s how the
tragedy occurred. The
pot wasn’t silver, it
was pewter. Pewter
has a lower melting-point than solder.
Result: A triangular hole as big as the
point of the soldering-iron burnt through
the ornamental utensil. Now a worried
youth has stalled off temporarily with:
“I’ve taken that teapot home to do it.”
His tech, teacher advises him to patch it
with another piece of pewter —but can’t
say where he’ll find a piece. And his
boss, being a true plumber, “Used to
know a method of soldering pewter, but
damned if I don’t forget it.”

“Ginger”: Late one night my aged
chestnut mare, usually well-behaved,
jumped two sets of sliprails and the
orchard gate to reach the back door,
where she stamped impatiently. She had
been running in a bush paddock with her
eldest filly, which was due to foal in a
few weeks’ time. Examination found
nothing wrong with the mare, but she
was plainly upset about something. At
daylight I rode her into the bush paddock,
and gave her her head. Following a
meandering course, evidently the way she
had come home, she brought me to where
the filly was stuck fast across a fallen
redgum sapling; she could get neither
forward nor backward. I lifted her front-
legs one at a time and shoved her back.
She was uninjured but thirsty, and made
at once for the creek, the old mare and
I following thankfully. That’s real horse-
sense.
SHORT-CUT.
Lift the wire and through the fence,
Over the grass untrod
And star-like flowers bright and dense
That grace the dustless sod;
In between the saplings tall,
O’er sticks that crack and spring
And leaves that turn where soft feet fall
In idle wandering.
On to the creek and soft wet sand,
Adown the clayey side:
Shadowed depths on every hand,
Steep banks that slip and slide;
Up among the straggling stumps,
Under a post-and-rail:
Waving grass and bushy clumps,
The whirring wings of quail.
Across the swamp-grass green and dark:
Horses busy with flies;
Now stop where a stranger left his mark—
Where an old cartridge lies.
Groundlark’s nest and hole of snake,
A wide-eyed hare “asleep”;
Lizards scuttle and grasses shake,
The bull roars low and deep.
Up and down and round about,
A drink in the gum-tree’s shade:
Waters winding in and out,
Clear, shallow spots to wade..
Taking a cut that halves the way
Saves time—as can be seen.
Huh! how can anybody say
“Oh, what a time you’ve been!”

All sections of this wool broking,
pastoral-finance, merchandising a n d
agency business, which is spread through-
out Victoria and the Riverina in N.S.W.,
contributed to the leap of £65,937 in last
term’s record profit figure. The buoyancy
was due chiefly to phenomenally high
prices for wool and livestock. Another
good season —third in succession- and
continued expansion of the business were
contributing factors.
Australia’s wool cheque for the 10
months to April 30, 1951, was no less
than 145 p.c. (£336,556,242) more than
for the corresponding period of the
previous season: —

The £568,429,949 was over six times
greater than the value of the entire clip
for 1946-47 (the first year of post-war free
auctions), and the inflationary effects have
become an embarrassment to the Aus-
tralian economy.
There was a steep and almost unbroken
rise in prices for all grades of wool

March last: —

I American buying support was temporarily
withdrawn in April, and there was a sharp
drop of 22-34 p.c. in prices for the 64’s-
58’s bracket, which includes the bulk of
sales. The market has since fluctuated
within narrow limits. No further marked
recession in prices is anticipated at the
moment. Under the double pressure ot
defence and civilian demand the supply
position looks like remaining tight for
some time.
The co. put 114,112 bales (down 10,299
bales) under the hammer, leaving 22,903
bales (up 13,919 bales) to carry forward.
After providing for contingencies—and
the provision is not likely to have been
skimped—gross earnings increased by
£402,423, reaching £962,018. Operating
exes made off with £610,040 (up
£223,863), and provisions were deijecia-
tiou £33.735 (up £8623),
(up £100,000) and staff fund £10,000 (up
£4000). The £158,243 of profit that re-
mained was 18.1 p.c. on capital as
against 14.8, 10.2, 7.5, 6 and 4.5 p.c. back
lo 1946. The div. was lifted from 10 p.c.
to 12} p.c
Balance-sheet figures mainly reflect
inflated prices, the heavy wool carry-over
and continued expansion of the business:

The growths in the creditors item (up
£2,881,948) and cash, etc. (up £2,097,883)
are interrelated, being largely an account
of wool and other transactions unsettled
at balancing date. Advances increased
by £876,468, merchandise by £30,991 and
premises and plant by £57,609. There
was a drop of £8741 in the more-or-less
liquid surplus (£878,271) due to the
outlay on fixed assets.
It is too early yet to say how seasonal
conditions will affect the coming clip;
rain is needed on most properties in the
co.’s area. On the growing side interest
at the moment centres largely in proposals
for anew wool-control scheme to replace
J.O. It is to be a jointly-owned Govern-
ment-growers body, the broad aim being
to protect growers against any catas-
trophic drop in wool values by fixing floor
prices for the staple. The scheme is in
the incubation stage at present, and a lot
lof problems associated with control and
finance will need to be ironed out before
growers are likely to vote in favor of it.
At 41s. 6d. (345. 9d. a year ago) the

t Not including depreciation reserve—£B43,l96 at
31/12/’SO.
The board blames the steep lifts in wage
and other operating costs, including
prices of essential raw materials, for the
slip of £3533 in the 1950 profit of this
Bundaberg grower and miller. Never-
theless, the £48,760 of profit claimed
was written after allowing an extra
£10,048 for depreciation (£24,894) and an
unstated amount for taxation and other
contingencies. The £48,760 was 17.4 p.c.
on capital compared with 18.6, 25.9, 14.2
and 8.7 p.c. back to 1946. So the 12 p.c.
div., of which 3£ p.c. is labelled bonus,
remained a comfortable matter. A record
tonnage of cane was put through the
rollers, and, although an excessively wet
season lowered the sugar content, the
total outturn of raws was 2465 tons better
at 33,365 tons, which was 1765 tons above
the year’s allotted mill peak.
About 56 p.c. of last season’s Australian
output of raws (920,416 tons) was sold
locally, balance being taken by the
British Ministry of Food under contract.
Last season the home price, which is
controlled, was steady at £23 16s. 6d.
a ton, and the export surplus is expected
to average £A32 16s. 6d. a ton as against
£A29 7s. 6d. for 1949 and £AIS for
1944. Overall average price for the
season was £27 17s. 2d. a ton,
compared with £26 9s. 3d. for 1949 and
£l9 16s. for 1944. The volume and price
of the export surplus—the increase in
both has largely taken care of the upsurge
in costs since war ended —have thus be-
come important factors in the profit-earn-
ing capacity of the industry, as well as
in the comparatively cheap figure at which
fines are retailed on the local market,
namely sd. a pound.
Moreover, the outlook for Australian
producers has been brightened by the
1949 sugar agreement with the U-K..,
which has undertaken to buy the whole
of our exportable surplus at a guaranteed
price for the three years to end 192)2,
and for the next five years to find markets
for up to 600,000 tons p.a. (the old export
quota was 400,000 tons p.a.), one halt
at a guaranteed figure and the other halt
at the world market price, plus prefer-
ence. The guaranteed price is to be
negotiated annually. The agreement
opens the way to increased production,
and to the lifting of mill peaks and conse-
quent expansion of milling capacity.
For Bingara (Gibson and Howes’s mill)
the peak is to be stepped up to 33,400
tons by 1953, To help meet the cost of
extra tramlines, rolling-stock, and mill
plant and buildings, the co. issued 140,000
new £1 ords. at par, one for two, to those
on the register at Nov. 30 last. When
fully-paid, the issue will lift the total on
the share register to £420,000, on which
12 p.c. will call for only £1640 more
profit than was claimed last term.
Only £5425 of the new capital had
come in when the books closed:

surplus (£102,454) was £26,447,
The current year’s production is ex-
pected to approximate last year’s figure.
Chief fear at the moment is the possi-
bility of the recent Canada-Cuba deal,
involving about 75,000 tons raws, reduc-
ing sales of Australian- and other British-
grown sugar on the Canadian market,
which bought about 98 p.c, of its 1950
requirements (over 500,000 tons) from the
British Ministry of Food. Britain, too,
recently bought Cuban sugar in order to
supplement its home-market ration.
Together with the trend of events
at the international trade confer-
ence at Torquay (Eng.) concerning
Empire preferences, it has all caused
anxiety among Australian producers
about the future of the new sugar agree-
ment with Britain.
At 545. (525. a. few months ago) the
co.’s f.-p. £1 shares return 4.4 p.c. on a
12 p.c. div, basis. Including the depreci-
ation reserve, some of which might be
genuine profit, and the new share issue,
net tangible cover is 455. 2d.

All-round expansion is the dominant
feature of the latest accounts of this
big Adelaide brewing business, which
has a strong hold upon the trade through-
out South Australia and over the border
at the thirsty and prosperous mining
centre of Broken Hill (N.S.W.). And
with the economic barometer high and
still rising under pressure of a growing
population, expanding industrial activity,
monetary inflation and high level of
employment further growth of the busi-
ness, which will call for “substantial”
capital outlay, is anticipated.
To provide for purchase and erection
of additional hotel properties and im-
provement of old ones and for the exten-
sion and modernisation of plant and
equipment, those on the register at June
1, 1950, were offered 361,040 new £1
shares, one for two, at par. The issue —
it was equivalent to a bonus to share-
holders because of the high premium
commanded by the scrip in the market-
lifted paid capital to £1,083,120.
There was marked growth in turn-
over. Australian beer production
increased by 11.4 p.c., reaching 156
million gallons, 'aji average of 19 gallons
per head of population, for the year to
June 30, 1950, and has continued to
increase at a lesser rate since. So, despite
the steep rise in costs and the fact that
the new capital was available for only
the last eight months of the term, net
earnings took an obliging leap of £41,117,
thus keeping visible earning-power on an
even keel. The record £133,387 of profit
claimed—the figure was written after
making unspecified provision for depre-
ciation, taxation and other contingencies
—was 12.3 p.c. on capital as it now
stands, compared with 12.8, 12.7, 12.6,
13 and 12.4 p.c. back to 1946. So there
was no difficulty in maintaining the
10 p.c. div., which has been an annual
event since 1919, except for the seven
slump years to 1937, when distributions
averaged 7 p.c., the lowest being 6 p.c.
In addition £194,681 of inner reserves
(excess provisions for doubtful debts,
taxation and contingencies) were brought
from hiding and put in the window, mak-
ing total disclosure of inner reserves over
the last 28 years £548,814, which suggests
that the board always has been cautious
in the amount of profit claimed m me
p. and 1, account. Over the same period
£250 000 of reserves were capitalised (in
1924 and 1928), and the Walkerville Co-
op. Brewery, the co.’s biggest competitor,
was absorbed (in 1938) at a cost of
£122,189 (in scrip), which was £149,691
less than the net tangible book-value or
I assets acquired.
The continued growth of the undertak-
ing and disclosure of inner reserves, to-
gether with a healthy financial position,
are further reflected in balance-shee
figures. _ 19^ 9 19 j 0 . 1951.

The year’s contraction in the amount
coming to creditors, etc. (down £69,03-)
and the net additions to book debts (up

COMPANY MEETING.
THE CONSOLIDATED
ZINC CORPORATION
LARGER TRADING PROFIT
Funds Conserved to Meet Development
Expenditure
The annual general meeting of The Consolidated Zinc Corporation
Ltd. will be held on June 19, in London.
The following are extracts from the statement by the Chairman,
Mr. John R. Govett, which has been circulated with the report and
accounts:
The market conditions are reflected in this year’s financial results,
in which the profits for the year, before taxation, amount to £4,570,800,
compared with £3,453,429 for 1949, an increase of £1,117,371. The net
profit for the year, after providing for taxation (£3,011,419) and deduct-
ing the interest of the minority shareholders in Subsidiary Companies
(£129,701) amounts to £1,429,680, compared with £1,227,119 for the
previous year, an increase of £202,561. Reserves have increased out
of profits for the year by £744,710, of which £200,000 has been set aside
by the Parent Company for general use within the Group, and £544,710
has been provided in the accounts of the main Subsidiary Companies
so as to enable them to retain funds required for capital expenditure
programmes.
RISING COSTS.
I consider the results of the year to be satisfactory and that they
are a fair indication both of the expanding nature of our activities and
of the efforts of those who are in charge of our operations in this
country and in Australia. It is nevertheless necessary to emphasise that
these profits were earned during a period of high prices, which are now
subject to artificial support by emergency conditions wnich neither you
no/ I would willingly see prolonged. Costs have inevitably increased,
due mainly to reasons outside the control of the Company. In Aus-
tralia, in particular, there has been a substantial advance in the basic
wage (as well as in the lead bonus which fluctuates with the price of
lead) affecting the costs of development, mining, milling and smelting,
in rail charges, in sea freights—in fact, under most headings of expendi-
ture. Rising costs have also increased the amount of working capital
required to finance stocks and constantly serve to reduce the margin of
our resources available for the replacement of outworn plant and
machinery at today’s inflated prices, and to meet our development pro-
gramme, an indication of which was given in last year’s report.
In view of this need to conserve funds to meet future requirements,
I regret that we are unable to recommend an increase of dividend and
are proposing to pay the same rate as that paid last year, namely 2/6
per share for the year.
In this connection I referred last year to the need of some relief
from taxation to enable Companies such as ours to make adequate pro-
vision for plant replacements. The report of the Millard Tucker Com-
mittee, which has been investigating this problem, has been a disappoint-
ment on this point and the problem with which industry is faced has
been magnified by the measure proposed by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in his recent Budget to suspend from next year the initial
allowances on capital expenditure on plant and buildings. Even on a
basis where the present level of profits is maintained in the future, this
measure, combined with the rise in income tax and the heavier taxa-
tion on profits distributed in dividend, must serve to reduce further the
amount available for capital requirements.
MARKETS.
It is of interest to note that during 1950, as compared with 1949,
imports, both in metal and concentrate form, of lead into the U.S.A.
increased from 385,000 tons to 521,000 tons, and of zinc from 368,000
tons to 428,000 tons. During the same period imports into the U.K.
fell, in the case of lead from 187,000 tons to 172,000 tons, and in zinc
from 245,000 tons to 237,000 tons. The inference that may be drawn
from these figures is that American fabricators operating independently
were able to secure a greatly increased tonnage from outside sources,
thereby forestalling the attempted increases in purchases which had
become so necessary for industry in the U.K. As this country, unlike
the U.S.A., is almost entirely dependent on imported metal and con-
centrates, the position is relatively more serious.
Though the level of our prices must at all times depend on the
fluctuations in the American economy, there are now superimposed on
the normal civilian demand the requirements of rearmament. It is not
in my power to judge the final effect of this additional influence on the
world metal position. With this in mind, together with the financial
problems I have briefly outlined above, I am compelled to emphasise
the need of preserving, as far as it is possible to do so, adequate
resources to meet the emergencies which must be anticipated in the
critical time which lies ahead.
We look forward in common with all industry to a return to more
stable and peaceful conditions and to the recurrence of freer trading
facilities between countries. The most optimistic among us, however,
will hardly expect a readjustment to take place without the inevitable
set-backs to withstand which will impose considerable strain on industry.
Our policy should be guided on these lines and in this I feel confident
of receiving your support.

NEW BROKEN HILL
CONSOLIDATED
YEAR OF STEADY PROGRESS
Need for Conservation of Resources
The fifteenth annual general meeting of New Broken Hill Consoli-
dated Ltd. will be held on June 19 at 37 Dover-street, London, W.l.
The following are extracts from the statement by the Chairman,
Mr. John R. Govett, which has been circulated with the report and
accounts:
The net profit for the year 1950, after providing for taxation, was
£450,541, compared'with £384,014 for the previous year.
In considering their recommendation as to the final dividend for
the year, your board are strongly influenced by the substantial sum
still required to be spent in order to complete the equipment and
development of the mine. In the face of continuously rising costs of
all plant, equipment and labor, the board are of the opinion that cash
resources should this year again be conserved to safeguard the comple-
tion of the programme initiated in 1945. They are therefore unable
to propose any increase in dividend over and above that paid for the
previous year, namely, 30 per cent. I realise that this may prove a
disappointment to some who may have anticipated a higher final divi-
dend for the year in view of the rise in metal prices, but equally I
believe that they will endorse our determination to ensure full achieve-
ment of the success of their enterprise.
During the year 1950 good progress was maintained with the
development and equipment of our leases, despite a continued shortage
of manpower throughout the greater part of the year and increasing
delay in delivery of essential supplies of materials. These factors
restricted our output, but while this shows a reduction of 9500 tons of
ore on the previous year, it is satisfying to record that the average
production per day worked in 1950 and the total lead production were
slightly higher than in 1949.
I have frequently had occasion jn the past to stress the importance of
an adequate supply of manpower to the successful achievement of our
objectives. This problem has been receiving the constant attention of
all the Mining Companies at Broken Hill. I am happy to be able to
say that as a result of negotiations successfully concluded with the
Workers’ Industrial Union of Australia, arrangements have been made
which provide a wider field for recruitment and, we hope, will ensure
the manpower required for our expansion programmes and which, at
the same time, will safeguard the interests of those on whom the success
of the industry has depended in the past. It is gratifying to note that
from the date on which these arrangements come into effect up to the
end of March, 1951, 67 men able to qualify under the amendment have
been added to our strength, bringing the total at the latter date, includ-
ing men engaged under the old rule, to 552. This compared with a
total at December 31, 1949, of 475.
OPERATIONS.
Ore production from the company’s leases in 1950 totalled 165,668
tons, compared with 175,232 tons in 1949. Under the terms of the sale
of ore agreement with the Zinc Corporation we purchased 43,332 tons
of ore, and the total ore treated for our account was 209,017 tons.
Deliveries of ore under the agreement have now been completed. As a
result, while every effort will be made to increase the quantity and grade
of our own production, our output in 1951 may fall short of the total
tonnage treated on our account in 1950.
My statement at the annual meeting held in June, 1950, and the
report on development and diamond drilling results issued in August
of last year, referred to the highly satisfactory results from crosscuts
and drilling on the No. 19 Level (2760 ft.). With regard to the general
development on No. 19 Level, the Service Winze from No. 18 Level
(2600 ft.), at 438 ft. south of our northern boundary, is operating and
east and west crosscuts from it are being advanced. This work, to-
gether with that of parties from the Boundary Winze, will ensure the
rapid opening up of these rich ore bodies during 1951 and 1952.
On the surface excellent progress has been made with the construc-
tion of the main buildings. The Main Winder House, Crusher House,
Mill Buildings (First Section) and No. 1 Ore Bin have now been prac-
tically completed. Installation of plant is now proceeding, but the
work is being hindered by the difficulties experienced by suppliers in
maintaining delivery dates.
The year has been one of steady progress towards our objective of
developing and equipping our mine as a major and independent pro-
ducer. Development work carried out to date more than fulfils the
earlier expectations on which our ten-year expansion programme was
based and I have every confidence in the future of the property.

ceived was equal to £750.5 (up
£190.8) per ton of metal. All-in
costs were £539.5 (up £138.8) per
ton metal. The board was thus
able to write net profit only
£5990 short of the previous year’s
at £35,800, equal to 29.8 p.c. on
the £120,000 of paid capital. The
div. was lifted from ss. to Bs.
per £1 share, but Malayan
income tax was increased from
20 p.c. to 30 p.c., so a 40
p.c. div. is worth only 28 p.c.
(£33,600) in the hands of share-
holders.
A year ago it was expected that
the dredge would have treated
all payable ground by mid-1951,
but with the price of tin and
costs as they are there is about
12 months’ work ahead in low-
grade dirt. Terrorist activities
have made prospecting impos-
sible, but the hunt for anew
property is to begin as soon as
circumstances permit. If one
isn’t found before present ground
is worked out the dredge is to
be put on a care-and-mainten-
ance basis.
The co.’s war-damage claims,
etc., have been assessed at
£43,260, of which £25,956 was
received and paid off the re-
habilitation loan, reducing it to
£7697. Including the div.
(£33,600) and sundry creditors
(£6752), current liabilities
totalled £54,809; and there was
£237,317 in cash, etc., to meet
it. Stores figured at £33,485.
The market prices the scrip at
255. 9d. as against 19s. a year
ago.
Kundang Tin still awaits
assessment of its war-damage
claims, including loss of the
dredge, which was dismantled
and removed during the Jap
occupation. The amount of the
co.’s claim is not disclosed in
the accounts, but a token pay-
ment of £4l has been received
in acknowledgment. The dredge
(£91,866) and buildings, etc.
(£13,998) appear at cost, less de-
preciation (£17,838), or £88,026
net, and the property figures at
£26,000 net. Current assets
(mostly cash) total £47,183, and
current liabilities £127. The
property is at Kundang
(Malaya), where some 230 acres
of pay dirt, averaging about
0.31 b. t.o. per c.y., remains to be
treated. Since this area is too
small to warrant installation of a
new dredge, negotiations are in
hand with an associated co. to
work the ground as soon as a
suitable machine becomes avail-
able. Paid capital is £125,000
in f.-p. £1 shares, which recently
fetched 17s. on Sydney ’Change
as against Bs. 9d. a year ago.

New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd.,
has completed the amalgamating
section of its treatment mill at
Golden Ridges, near Wau (New
Guinea), ahead of schedule, and
the plant is now being run-in on
low - grade ore. Full - scale
throughput of 100 tons a day is
expected to be reached next
month. Tailings are to be stored
pending construction of a
cyaniding plant. At Sept. 30,
1950, ore reserves at the Ridges
were estimated at 102,717 tons,
averaging 9.2dwt. gold, after
allowing for 10 p.c. dilution,
Taking costs at double their pre-
war level, this section is expected
to show a profit of about £3OOO
a month, rising to £SOOO a
month when the cyaniding plant
gets into full swing. Prospects
of more pay-ore being developed
are encouraging, especially in
the calcite body disclosed by
drilling. The co.’s production
and sales of timber continue at
a “satisfactory” rate, and in-
come from alluvials remains
around recent levels. Paid capi-
tal is £950,371 in f.-p. 4s. 3d.
shares, which have a fairly steady
market around 2s. 3d. each.

Investment Yields and Prices
The trend towards higher
interest rates seems definite
enough. It is already acknow-
ledged in Britain and the U.S.A.,
and Australia has held out
against it as well as any coun-
try, At the same time it should
be remembered that Australian
long-term bond rates are higher
than in Britain, the U.S.A. or
Canada. In the U.S.A., for
instance, 16-21 year bonds at
present yield 2% p.c., whereas
the present long-term offering in
Australia yields a flat £3 3s. Id.
per cent, or £3 4s. 3d. per cent.,
including redemption. Previous
issue carried £3 2s. 6d. per cent.
The increase in the effective
yield from Australian Govern-
ment loans has had no apparent
influence on the sharemarkets.
In any case, the increase was
simply an acknowledgment of
something that had already hap-
pened. The investing public is
not particularly interested in
money yields on ’Change at pre-
sent ; it is more concerned about
what is loosely termed “capital
appreciation,” but what, in fact,
is more truly “capital protec-
tion” against inflation.
Thus motor-finance and simi-
lar concerns, quite soundly estab-
lished, can be bought to give a
return of as much as 7 p.c. But
manufacturing enterprises, not-
withstanding labor and fuel
problems, are being bought to
yield as little as 2.8 p.c. in the
case of B.HJP., 2J p.c. A.CJL
The chain-store cos., G. J, Coles
and Woolworths, return 2.8 p.c.
or less.
An almost indiscriminate trad-
ing flurry in some of the new
five-shilling share-issues goes on.
Where the cos. concerned have
an established div. record tne
market generally takes notice of
immediate yields; but where the
future is still in the melting-pot
gossip and rumor have a lot to
do with the price.
Bonus issues, too, are having
an exhilarating effect on many
of the stocks concerned. Yet
very few people appear to stop
to consider the effect on future
dividend rates. G. E, Crane
(Sydney) at least has made it
clear to shareholders that its
bonus issue does not presage any
immediate prospect of an in-
crease in total div. distributions.
Most other concerns have left
future div. prospects to the
imaginations of shareholders.
Some of these may suffer disil-
lusionment later on.
M.L. Motor-tyre Scarcity
After fighting a losing battle
for two years against shortages
and labor bottlenecks in a vain
effort to become self-supporting
in motor-tyres behind the
shelter of its import barrier.
New Zealand has given up the
struggle and is back again as a
buyer of tyres in world markets.
Its three tyre-manufacturing
plants Reid New Zealand
Rubber Mills, Ltd. (Auckland),
Dunlop (N.Z.), Ltd. (Wel-
lington) and the Firestone Tyre
and Rubber Co. of N.Z., Ltd,
(Christchurch) —-■ haven’t been
able to do the trick, and now
Maoriland is forced to go in
quest of surplus tyres when there
are none to be found anywhere
in the world. It isn’t the fault
of the cos. that they’ve fallen
down on the job—the odds have
been too much for them, and
they haven’t been helped by
hoarding of tyres since motorists
and commercial users got wind
of a coming famine.
Maoriland’s demand is half a
million tyres a year, 30,000 of
them odd sizes that have never
been placed under import ban,
and the cos. claim they’ve more
than enough capacity to satisfy
the need if they were given an
even chance ; but they’ve had
a long waterfront strike to put
up with, on top of a crop of
worries connected with world
scarcity of key materials which
hit them before they got into
“From now on , my boy , you'll have to forget Plato and
Aristotle —that is, if you Want to make any money."
their stride. With everything in
their favor, and working all
round the clock —which seems a
long shot in M.L.’s limited in-
dustrial field —the cos. reckon
they could turn out up to three-
quarters of a million tyres a
year, but this potential capacity
isn’t helping to meet the needs
of M.L.’s 420,000 motor-
vehicles now. In six years since
the end of the war the motor
fleet has grown by 40 p.c.
Australia has no tyres to spare
for Maoriland, there’s no surplus
in dollar markets, and John Bull
will have to go short if he
releases any from his meagre
supply. So it’s a barren
prospect, with no important
change likely just round the
corner. It isn’t just a matter of
rubber ; cotton, bead - wire,
sulphur and chemicals for tyres
are all on the scarce list
Electricity Meter and Allied
Industries, Ltd., has had a record
year—consolidated net profit
was £347,823, after appropriat-
ing £300,000 for stock and plant
depreciation contingencies. In
the preceding year profit was
£177,526, when £158,p00 was set
aside against a possible fall in
stock value, etc. At the 1949
balance stocks appeared in the
books at £2,796,643, and there
was £3,308,313 owing to out-
siders. (Paid capi t al is
£1,662,382.) By its special
appropriations the co. shows
itself to be alive to stock
problems, and last year’s profit
appears to have been well and
truly earned. The net result
shown for last year was a shade
under 22 p.c. on ord. capital,
allowing for pref. divs. The
div., including bonus, was raised
from 8 p.c. to 12| p.c. The
market had already anticipated
last Thursday’s figures, and the
shares were steady at 655., fol-
lowing a rise from as low as
475. 6d. this year.
The directors’ comments
accompanying announcement of
a one-for-two bonus issue by
G. E. Crane and Sons, Ltd.,
Sydney, should be heeded by all
other current recipients of bonus
scrip. Crane’s, manufacturers
of metal products, engineers,
etc., last year earned profits
equal to 41.1 p.c. on ord. capital
and naid a 124- p.c. div. Net
tangible assets have a book-value
of 535. 4d. a share. But the
directors do not intend to main-
tain the present \2\ p.c. div. on
the bonus-enlarged capital.
They say they expect, after
June 30 next, to distribute a sum
in divs. approximating the
current total distribution. Most
of the present bonus issue
(about £108,084) will come from
revaluation of freehold pro-
perties (which have been
written-up by £138,264). Only
£3OOO will come from share-
premium reserve.

Sargood Gardiner ords., which
sold as low as 245, 6d. a couple
of weeks ago, have since re-
covered to 28s. On the basis of
the interim div. the yield is
£3 11s. sd. per cent, (tax-free),
or £4 ss. 9d. per cent, (tax-free)
if the distribution for the year is
6 p.c. out of tax-free reserves.
For tfie three previous years the
distribution was 7 p.c., tax-free.
There is enough in the ord, tax-
free reserve for a couple more
7 p.c. distributions. Paid capital
is £1,013,110 in 462,294 £1 ords.
and 550,816 5 p.c. (participating
up to 6 p.c. if the ords. receive
11 n.c.) £1 prefs. Earlier this
year the co. issued £400,000 of
p.c. unsecured notes with a
six-eight years’ currency. Last
year’s earnings were equal to
11.1 p.c. on ord, capital. When
the high premiums paid on
the Stock Exchanges for
many recent unproved issues are
considered, the ords. in Sargood
Gardiner at 28s. have attrac-
tions. The co. at present is ex-
panding its clothing-manufactur-
ing operations, and a good deal
is expected from the new Dee
Why (Sydney) factory.
♦ * * ♦
Though the G. J. Coles board
has said no new issue of capital
is contemplated in connection
with it, the purchase of the Foy
and Gibson interest in F. and
G. Stores, Ltd., for more than
a million stimulated interest in
Coles scrip for a couple of days,
sending the ss. shares up to
31s. 6d. at one stage. Later
quotations fell to around
28s. 6d. in Sydney, At that they
were about a shilling higher than
prices for Wool worths’ shares
F. and G. Stores were formerly
carried on by O. Gilpin, Ltd.,
and represent 91 retail drapery
stores in Victoria, N. S. Wales.
South Australia and Tasmania
The deal will increase the
number of Coles-controlled
stores to 240, including 40 new
centres.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
Bradford Cotton is increasing
its nominal capital to £5,000,000.
Present paid capital is
£1,855,184, of which £1,740,855
is ord. money. No new issue
appears to be contemplated
immediately. On previous
occasions the board has sought
an increase in nominal capital
some time prior to an actual
new issue. The co.’s £1 shares
have strengthened to 555. 6d. in
recent weeks, to yield 3.6 p.c. on
a 10 p.c. div. basis. The co. by
now should be benefiting from
the transfer of part of its N. S.
Wales operations to country
areas.

Hastings Deering Finance
& Investment Co. Limited
STATUTORY MEETING HELD THURSDAY, 10th MAY, 1951
At the Statutory Meeting of Hastings Deering Finance &
Investment Company Limited/ held on 10th May# 1951, Mr. H.
Hastings Deering, Chairman of Directors, addressed the Share-
holders, and, in the course of his remarks, said:—
"The Company was incorporated on Bth December, 1950,
and your Directors and Staff have been very busy since then
In issuing the capital and in organising the Company's affairs
and investing its capital.
The issued capital, namely £500,000, has been progres-
sively and soundly invested and you will note in the Report
that as at 16th April, our investments were £505,589. You may
take this as evidence that the Company has got off to a good
start and that we are earning good profits, which should enable
us to put something to reserves and pay reasonable dividends.
At present our business is coming mainly from the
Hastings Deering Companies and associates. We were fortunate
in being able to acquire at cost from Hastings Deering Service
Limited, the whole of its investment in hire purchase contracts
current at 31st January, amounting to £234,772—a figure sub-
stantially greater than the prospectus estimate of £175,000.
It would seem likely that our original estimates of the
volume of business which would come our way might prove
conservative, apart from new business—which promises well.
For example, we have made arrangements with Sim Company
Pty. Limited to finance retail sales of Fordson Tractors and
Malcolm Moore Equipment, and are already receiving an
acceptable volume of business from this source. It would be
premature for me to speak of other sources of revenue being
developed, of which your Directors are closely informed. It is
sufficient for me to indicate that your Board views the future
of the Company with confidence. The potential business from
the Hastings Deering group of Companies and associates is
considerable. The products they distribute, namely. Ford Cars
and Trucks, A.E.C. Trucks and 'Buses, Caterpillar Tractors,
lima and Michigan Cranes and Shovels and other earth-
moving equipment Atlas Compressors, Rock Drills and Mining
Equipment and Haxland & Wolff Diesel Engines and Genera-
tors, are essential to our immediate national objectives—Produc-
tion, Defence and Development—and they are In strong
demand.
The financial service which your Company is designed to
give contractors and other users of these fine products is thus
an integral part of good national work and, like all good work,
it carries the expectation of a fair reward."
STM-1
London Airmail
From Herbert Holman
Differences of opinion about
the Festival of Britain are
now resolved, chiefly by the
occasion of the Royal blessing.
The ceremonial opening by t e
King on the steps of St. Pan ’s
Cathedral and the informal vi
next day of the Royal family
the South Bank Exhibitio
ended murmurs of protest anc
awakened wider enthusiasm.
And now all roads lead
Charing Cross. The immen
crowds that converge upon the
Embankment from the Stran
at nightfall blink their ey
with delighted astonishment a
the bright, dazzling, highly
colored peep-show beyond th
twinkling river. What was one
a dowdy Thames-side jumble o :
bricks-and-mortar has become
gleaming oasis of white concree
and shimmering crystal. Splendic
buildings, simple in line anc
solidly elegant, contrast witi
fantastic, angular glass palaces
the ancient shot-tower, now
partly lighthouse and partly
radar-station, is newly crownec
with a meaningful criss-cross o :
wires ; there are piers, fountain
shot with bright hues, an
irrational, gravity-c hea t i n
shapes ; and a large object, lik
a thin cigar, blazes with whit
light and apparently suspends
space. First impressions ar
astounding, unaccountable anc
altogether compelling.
Over the River
A Bailey bridge connects the
Embankment with the Exhibi
tion turnstiles. (Not to have
ticketed it as an exhibit seems to
be a culpable oversight. Inside
the pavilions are many lesser
British achievements than this
most serviceable development of
a child’s toy.) Once across the
river the first thing that strikes
the visitor is the absence of any
distinctive design or style. Cubisi
shapes and patterns jostle formal
rectangular buildings; stair-
cases lead to nowhere; floor-
levels vary ; and cat-walks cross
diagonally over the main
avenues. The effect is unex-
pected and stimulating.
The next impression is one of
space; the few acres seem
vastly wider in extent than they
are. So cunningly have the
architects studied the terrain
that every corner turned brings
a surprise. From no one point
of vantage in the grounds is it
possible to see the whole ex-
hibition ; and every approach to
the river gives the idea of a
straight, and not sharply-curv-
ing, Thames.
The object of the exhibition is
declared to be the telling “by
displays of tangible things....
for which Britain’s prestige
stands highest” of a continuous
story “throughout its extent, each
pavilion providing a chapter in
this story.” These displays are
confined mainly to science,
technology and industrial design.
“Intangibles” that may have also
contributed something less
material but no less substantial
to British life, such as sociology,
.music, drama and literature, are
held not to lend themselves to
exhibition display.
This assertion sounds so dog-
matic as to be a challenge. On
Bankside? The Globe-theatre
site is a few yards downstream.
A mile beyond, in Southwark,
the Little Dorrit church still
stands. Directly across the
river old Dan’l Peggotty dis-
consolately sought the heartless
Steerforth. But let it pass.
Gaily-colored balls and glass
screens have been erected to
keep grimy South London out
of sight; and, no doubt, to keep
such stupid flights of fancy as
these out of mind.
General Impressions
A dotted line on the official
guide enables visitors, if they
choose, to start at the beginning
and finish at the end of this
quite comprehensive march of
progress. But so irrational is
human nature in a state of
society planned to make things
easy for it that most people un-
gratefully ignore this boon and
steadfastly go their own ways.
They leave some hours later
tired, foot-sore, impressed,
amazed and not a little per-
plexed. Much is self-evident
(like the cricketer’s gear in
“Sport”) or above the layman’s
head (like the structure and
nature of matter in the Dome of
Discovery). The working-models
are fascinating, and the engines
in “Transport and Communica-
tions” enthralling. Where the
human element surpasses the
technological, as in Exploration,
or Health, or New Schools, or
the People of Britain, fascina-
tion overtakes interest.
Notable British achievements
are presented modestly and with
characteristic understatement.
One example is the Dome of
Discovery itself, which re-
sembles a gigantic toadstool
without stem and, with a span
of 365 ft., has the largest dome
in the world; this fact, and
those of its construction, are
relegated to an obscure corner.
The telecinema offers two
novelties —television on the
large screen and stereoscopic
films. Of the former, a hint of
its possible consequences may
be gathered from the fact that
a well-known actress whom we
had seen waiting in the foyer
appeared five minutes later on
the screen, “shot” from a back-
room. What the teleprinter does
now the telecinema may well do
in the future. The stereofilms
still call for the use of red-and-
green spectacles, and, helped by
technicolor, are more serious in
intent than others we have
known. Stereosound, by means
of which the sound-track is
given a third dimension, is less
successful.
The Royal Festival Hall is
the one permanent building on
the site. An “egg in a box,” its
construction has been pain-
stakingly devoted to one pur-
pose—t h e acoustically-p ure
concert-hall. There is some mild
controversy about whether its
success is more gratifying to
science than to music. Like
happiness, perfect acoustics are
elusive when consciously pur-
sued. But one fact stands out,
encouraging to listeners if not to
all performers: the hall
markedly shows up slovenly
execution. It will keep con-
ductors and players on their
toes.
Festival Theatre
There is something for every-
body in the West End, with
Danny Kaye in an eight-week
season at the “Palladium,”
Gilbert and Sullivan at home at
the “Savoy” and many interest-
ing new productions. Laurence
Olivier is Shakspeare’s Antony
and Shaw’s Cassar to Vivien
Leigh’s two Cleopatras, the one
a worldly matron and the other
a kittenish hoyden.
Tennent Productions, Ltd.,
have launched two successes; a
new trifle (“Waters of the
Moon”) with a mighty cast, and
a perennial (“the Three Sisters”)
with an even mightier one.
There’s no difficulty in identify-
ing the score or so of characters,
since most of them have familiar
names and faces.
The Chekhov play (Aldwych-
theatre) has such punch and
gusto that, at first, it seems in-
congruous. Peter Ashmore is
producer and co-adapter and
evidently doesn’t believe in in-
spissated gloom and moaning
introspection. First thoughts
may conflict with accustomed
ideas, but second thoughts add
strength to his breakway. Why
shouldn’t these forlorn and
frustrated small-town Russians
be people of character and not
winnowing psychopaths? Cer-
tainly, this performance of style
and attack is the most stimulat-
ing bit of whole-blooded
theatre seen in London for a
long time.
Of the sisters, Olga (Celia
Johnson) is no weakling outside
the home; the most-suffering
Irina (Renee Asherson)
obviously needs, as well as
wants, to “go to Moscow” for
a fuller life; and Masha
(Margaret Leighton) has
patience, charm and depth of
soul that is wasted on her
pedantic, garrulous husband
(Walter Hudd). Her perform-
ance overrides all others in
power and subtlety. Ralph
Richardson makes tremendous
use of his fine presence and
resonant voice, but gives little
else except a fretful unease to
Vershinin.
It is unusual to find all the
characters played sympatheti-
cally ; all, that is, except the
waspish Natasha (Diana
Churchill), who is everything
that she shouldn’t be, and,
dramatically, should be. Of the
less well-known, Robert Beau-
mont (Baron Nicolai) sustains a
long and difficult part with
delicate balance. A cast blended
into unity and playing with col-
lective rhythm is not generally
found to be star-studded. This
is the exception.


Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
Fifty years of Australian life is covered
by the designs which illustrate natural
life, the tropics and industry in the
Douglas Cox Jubilee spring and summer
fashion-show. One of the best designs
is Sanctuary, which shows the five
animals domiciled in the Healesville
Sanctuary, and broken by the tribal-signs
of aborigines. Rosella parrots wing their
way across the surface of a grey filament
crepe; the Northern Territory design
features tropical foliage finely etched in
natural colors. Patterned on a pale-
yellow cotton are clusters of golden
wattle, and on a wheatgold cotton blacks
dance in corroboree. “Exports” is the
name given to a design of windjammers
and bundles of cargo. The windjammers
are etched, but the cargo is colorful, the
background being a pale-grey filament-
crepe. A Jubilee cotton frock is printed
in a Sydney Harbor design ; this includes
an etched design of the bridge set amidst
a floral pattern.
Included in these Jubilee prints is
Rodeo, dedicated to North Queensland,
Yellow bands across the skirt of a cotton
frock throw into relief stockmen and their
horses. And last but not the least excit-
ing is the Theatre Royal print, a finely-
etched design showing all phases of
theatre-life on a background of tangerine
filament-crepe. Vice-Regal features car-
riages on a white cotton, Botanical
Gardens is as gay as its name implies.
Then there are Sugarcane and Harvest,
the latter sheaves of wheat patterned on
a filament-crepe and made up into a
smart dressmaker-suit. Soft and gay
Jubilee colors were important in this
show. The principal shades were sunkist-
pink, vivid-coral, wheat, powder-tint,
uranium-grey, admiral-navy, lilac, dawn-
taupe, sun-beige, raving-beauty and
pjum-brandy. The Jubilee silhouette,
says Douglas Cox, is slimmer, but skirts
are cut cleverly to allow for movement.
Their length is slightly shorter and
fabrics featured were plain and printed
shantungs, light and heavy Moygashel
linens, plain- and filament-crepes, sea-
island cottons, poplins, cotton-organza,
slipper-satin, faille, georgette and chiffon.
Mrs. Simon Warrender is chairman of
the committee organising a celebrity
concert to be held on Friday, June 29, at
the Town Hall, proceeds of which will
go to the Y.W.C.A. Appeal Fund. The
concert is under vice-regal patronage,
and the Governor, Sir Dallas Brooks,
and Lady Brooks will be present. Artists
include Peter Dawson, John Amadio and
Eunice Garland. Preferential bookings
may be made with Miss J. Truelove,
Y.W.C.A., 60 Russell-street. Ticket-
secretaries include Mary Elizabeth Fitz-
gerald (UY6869), Ailsa Holyman
(U 2686), Amanda Grimwade (BJ4488)
and Judith Silk (U 4646).
Mrs. Ricardo Odnoposoff was, before
her marriage to the celebrated violinist
now on his first Australian tour for the
A.8.C., the Baroness Hildegarde Faitik
von Ostfelden, daughter of a Viennese
diplomat. Not only does she attend every
concert at which her husband appears
but every rehearsal. Very pretty with
light auburn hair, she dresses very
smartly. At the celebrity concert at
which her husband was a soloist with
the Victorian Symphony Orchestra con-
ducted by Alceo Galliera, Mrs. Odno-
posoff wore a steel-grey faille ballerina
frock, with the side-drape lined with
Alice-blue faille to match the short
shoulder-cape. She sat with Bonnie Mc-
Callum, whose black gown was worn
with a dyed-ermine jacket. Among others
in the audience were Mary Paterson, who
draped a silver-fox stole over her short
black evening ensemble, Mrs. S. F.
Rowell, who was accompanied by her
daughter Rossalind, and Dorrie O’Neill,
in a black-and-white-patterned evening
gown under musquash.
Ten girls, wearing off-the-shoulder
gowns of pale-pink tulle over taffeta and
narrow bands of black velvet around
their throats, made their debut at the
South Melbourne Town Hall. Design of
the gown was chosen by the Mayoress of
South Melbourne, Mrs. John W. Wright,
who wore a strapless gown of del-blue
silk with all-over embroidery in white
thread. Mrs. Wright knows all there is to
know about the clothes girls should
wear, for she has two of her own.
One daughter, Shirley, returned home
from England at the beginning of the
week in the Strathaird. Her other
daughter, Helen, is still in England study-
ing for her diploma in industrial
chemistry.
In 1946 Jane Muntz was appointed the
first superintendent of the State Nurses’
Bureau, and in 1948 she received a
British Council bursary to study nursing
in Europe. When she returned from her
studies abroad Miss Muntz became a
welfare inspector in the maternal and
child-hygiene branch of the Department
of Health. She has now been appointed
nursing adviser to the State Minister for
Health, and will advise on all problems
associated with the training of women
and men in all branches of nursing, and
she will also co-ordinate all nursing and
allied agencies. A member of the Royal
Victorian College of Nursing, she is also
a member of the Victorian branch com-
mittee of the Florence Nightingale
National Committee and is on the
house-committee of the War Nurses
Memorial Centre.
Here is Zoe Caldwell, who is appear-
ing in the current Little Theatre produc-
tion, “All Over the Town.” Zoe, who
was educated at the Methodist Ladies
College, is now a teacher of speech-
therapy at several schools. A winner of
many prizes at competitions for elocution
and physical culture, she has done a lot
of radio work.
Members of the central council of
Royal Melbourne * Hospital Auxiliaries
met for their annual meeting in the
Melba Hall of the University Conser-
vatorium when Mr. A. G. Stephenson,
the architect who designed the Royal
Melbourne Hospital, was the speaker.
The president of the hospital. Sir Victor
Hurley, presided at the meeting, at which
Mrs. R. W. Chambers was re-elected
president of the central council. The
auxiliaries report showed how well they
had worked through the year. The 30
country and suburban auxiliaries of the
hospital raised £17,000 in cash and in
kind. An outstanding effort was the
kiosk auxiliary’s donation of £2250 —the
largest ever given for 12 months.
Another success was the egg appeal,
300,000 being collected; in this good
work was done by schoolchildren.
Kay Hughes, former president of the
Victoria League Young Contingent,
arrived home from America just in time
for the Empire Day late-afternoon, party
given by the chairman and committee of
the Y.C. at its clubrooms in Collins-
street. The chairman, Marjorie Tatnall,
received guests in a black wool frock con-
trasted with a skull-cap covered with pale
aqua-blue feathers. She was assisted by
Doris Bell, one of the hon. secretaries.
Kay Hughes covered her frock with a
coat of Scotch mole ; her cloche hat was
of pale-mauve straw. Clarissa Storey
added to her bright-rust wool frock a
small black velvet hat. Janice Holmes was
in beige wool. Mareta Norton, a visitor
from Perth’s Y.C., wore a gold-buttoned
grey wool coat and scarlet beret. A
pale-lilac cloche highlighted with colored
rhinestones lit up Betty Walters’s black
coat. Mrs. James Pettingell’s ensemble
was sage-green. Mrs. E. A. Cook’s black-
and-white-check suit was worn with a
black sailor hat. Mrs. Basil Dunn chose
a black frock and pink-lined black hat.
Irene Maxwell was a study in grey frock,
stole and matador beret.
Fur-lined suede boots and shoes were
popular at the Moonee Valley meeting.
Mrs. K. Imison matched her green suede
ankle-shoes with a smart matching beret.
Betty Jackson, who is to marry Douglas
Bowden at Melbourne Grammar Chapel
on June 16, was in a wool coat which
had large green-and-white checks; her
shoes of green leather matched her tiny
felt pillbox beret. Scarlet accessories
brightened Mrs. E. Headland’s blue-and-
white-checked belted coat. Mrs. Ray
Joseph’s French gaberdine belted coat
was in apple-green tonings. Nan
Horgan’s black-red-and-white-chevron-
patterned coat was worn with a black
velvet cloche. Mrs. Norman Strange
wore a black-and-grey-streaked Persian-
lamb coat with a beige pillbox beret,
Mrs. P. J. Lennon kept warm in mink;
her small black hat was finished with a
black-and-white feather cockade. A
jewelled veil was swathed over the
cinnamon-brown hat worn by Mrs. S.
Hannan with a dyed-ermine coat. Mrs.
S. J. Fletcher wore an unusual coat of
land-otter fur with a small black hat.
Dame Gertrude Cosgrove’s navy
ensemble was worn with a mink scarf.
From Sydney
The Jubilee Pageant presented by the
Royal Empire Society at their ball was
most inspiring, and its execution by
members of the Army, Navy and Air
Force a model of split-second accuracy,
Beginning with Roman soldiers bearing
the eagle, and early Britons with the
emblem of Wales (the oldest flag in the
world, according to the commentator), it
then showed the development of the
British flag, the badges of the Dominions
and colonies and the building-up of the
Australian flag. Jill Hemming was a dis-
tinguished Britannia. Juliet Tankersley
was Australia. The Governor took the
salute, and the array of uniforms and
decorations among the guests was almost
as spectacular as the pageant itself.
The guests were received by Mr, W. J.
Bradley and Lady Anderson, who wore
grey beaded georgette. Mrs. H. A.
Showers was in cocoa moire, Lady Gillan
in black satin with a full skirt and a
bodice decorated with golden sequins,
Mrs. D. Macarthur Onslow chose a
figured organdie with ruffles, Mrs. G. A.
Vasey (who is staying at Government
House and arrived with the official party)
wore orchid chiffon. Mrs. W. Bridge-
ford’s dress was black georgette, Mrs.
F. H. Berryman’s green satin, Mrs. R. V.
Bryant wore black with a sequin-
embroidered stole.
Our picture is of artist Alice Danciger,
whose exhibition will open at the Mac-
quarie Galleries on June 6, and who re-
turned to Australia quite recently after
living for four years in France and Italy,
Always noted for her own distinguished
dressing, Miss Danciger says that her
interest in fashion is “only as great as the
average woman’s,” but that she thought
the women of Rome were among the best-
dressed in the world. The Italian
materials are particularly lovely, and,
although clothes for daytime in Rome
were almost always casual, the standard
of taste was particularly high. Photo
by Norton-Trevaire.
Among those who held afternoon re-
ceptions in honor of Empire Day were
the English-Speaking Union, the Overseas
League (in conjunction with the Victoria
League) and the Queen Victoria Club.
The E.-S.U, entertained members of the
American community, whilst the Overseas
League’s party (held at the Troc.) had
the patronage of the Governor as guest-
of-honor.
A quite dispiriting show was given by
the Bureau of Fashion Trends at Prince’s
during the week, forecasting ominously
the styles of summer, 1952. With the
exception of one or two dresses (mostly
cotton) and the evening frocks, there
were distressing faults of styling, cut and
attention to detail everywhere. Designs
which have sold well over previous seasons
were presented again as the “new line,” in
the manner of those solicitous mothers
who give you pea-soup all the time be-
cause you once said you liked pea-soup.
Skimpiness in cut showed up most in
the jersey dresses, for jersey is a fabric
which must be amply cut. Certainly the
manufacturer is making “to a price,” but
there is no point in ruining 200 dresses in
order to get enough material to make an
extra ruined dress. There is no excuse
for showing summer coats which dip at
the back over dresses which dip at the
sides, nor for the succession of dreary
florals shown. And if the dresses were
skimped, the hats were too lavish, being
overladen with flowers and veils and
ribbons and ornaments. Manufac-
turers and retailers owe a duty
to the public, for the public can
buy only the clothes that are on the
racks, and its standard of taste will
depend on what is shown.
The introduction to this preview says
that “News-reels will show this parade
to six million Australians within two
months” and that “televised programmes
of it will be viewed on world-wide
screens.” If so, it will be viewed, this
Letter thinks, with alarm.
Wearing a dramatic black satin dress,
offset with scarlet and gold brocade,
Marjorie Lawrence dominated the per-
formance of “Elektra” at the Town Hall
with both her singing and her personality.
She stood throughout the opera on a plat-
form with rails which she holds for sup-
port. There is no sign of weakness in
her tall and vivid appearance, and in her
singing she showed the Town Hall audi-
ence how much strength and volume an
opera singer should really have, Marjorie
wore on her dress the diamond replica of
the Legion of Honor which was presented
to her for her concert-work for displaced
people in Europe.
Recitals at the Town Hall are not
generally taken to be opportunities for
the display of fine clothes, but Yehudi
Menuhin’s first concert packed the place
with as well-dressed an assembly as you
could wish to see. The furs were par-
ticularly beautiful, with Mrs. Menuhin’s
full-length mink the most breath-taking.
She was accompanied by Madge and Cyril
Ritchard, Madge wearing masses of
platina-fox. Hephzibah Menuhin, slim
and elegant in a delicate lace dress, also
took the eye. One can’t help noting how
“good” Sydney music-lovers are. They
listen with the utmost concentration and
in the completest silence to works such
as the Bartok sonata, even though their
delighted response to such works as the
Mendelssohn E Minor Concerto shows
that Mendelssohn is what they really like
best.
Fireworks don’t go off with such a loud
noise as they did in the past because a
less-explosive powder is used in their
manufacture, but Empire Day showed
that they are brighter than they ever were.
It was a clear and starry night for the
children, some of whom had been building
their bonfires on the beaches and in the
gullies for weeks. Experience has taught
the youngsters to guard their fires closely
until the right moment arrives to light
them with ceremonial flares, for, shameful
as this may seem, it is true that certain
mischievous types will set them off two
or three days before Empire Night, u
they get a chance. Judging by the glow-
ing hills all round Sydney last Thursday,
they didn’t have much success this year.
The annual fete C.E.N.E.F. held
on Friday was opened by Mrs.
E. J. Hallstrom, who, with her
husband, has always been an in-
terested benefactress of this good work.
The Archbishop presided at the opening
and Mrs. Mowll displayed quite a gift of
salesmanship in recommending pamphlets
about the Centre to the meeting. The
pamphlets, it must be added, were mostly
free. The stalls displayed some excellent
wares, especially cakes and home-made
jams, which, true to their advertisement,
were “at reasonable prices.” In the even-
ing a display of physical culture was given
by the girls of St. Stephen’s, Bellevue Hill.
Built as a memorial to the young men
and women who served in the Second
World War, and to the workers of the
C. of E. National Emergency Fund,
C.E.N.E.F. serves as a hostel for young
men doing rehabilitation courses and as
a centre for the training of youth.. Rev.
Graham Delbridge is in charge of this
work. The building is very modern,
clean, bright and beautiful, with a library
on the third floor which has been estab-
lished only six months, but already houses
2000 books. This centre cost £BO,OOO to
build, and although more than half has
already been paid off, there is still plenty
of scope for generous donors to help with
the work.
Shortages in household things jump
about and vary so much it’s hard for the
housewife to keep track. When potatoes
are off, for instance, rice is on, or vice
versa, or perhaps they’re both on
together. This is bringing back the age
of barter among families. Daughters are
saying to their mothers “How much sal
can you give me for these matches, a
“I have a tin of asparagus you can have
for two pork chops.” It’s not a system
that makes always for friendly relations,
but often it works out well.

PERSONAL ITEMS
IJ. C. Williamson’s could hardly have
done better than in its choice of English-
man John Casson as its new general-
producer. Director of the Glasgow
Citizen’s Theatre, Casson, at 41, is one of
the Old Dart’s most experienced
producers. It’s very much in the
blood. His father is Sir Lewis
Casson, one-time president of British
Actors’ Equity, actor pretty well
all over Europe, from Portugal and Ger-
many to Greece and Egypt, and pro-
ducer for, among other notables, Helen
Hayes, Ivor Novello and John Gielgud.
John’s mother is Sybil Thorndike.
Handing over the presidency of the
Associated Chambers of Commerce to
John Allison, of Melbourne, Albert
Edward Heath is one of the best-known
businessmen in Sydney. Much-travelled,
square-jawed, with a financial brain, he
has represented Australia at International
Chambers of Commerce congresses in
Vienna, Paris, Berlin and Montreux. He
joined the A.I.F. in 1914, was commis-
sioned in the 18th Battalion the following
year, but had his travelling intentions
altered by a solid dose of enteric fever,
though later he got to London —N.S.W.
Agent-General between 1934-38. In-
terested in timber, in which he got his
start, he’s now actively interested in
the industry’s many problems, and
recreationally in yachts and fishes.
As is probably well-known by now,
this is Australia’s Jubilee Year, honoring,
among others, the Architect of Federa-
tion, Sir Henry Parkes. It is also the

ARCHITECTURE.
year of his son, Cobden Parkes, reaching
the highest rank of his profession-presi-
dent of the Royal Australian Institute of
Architects, as from this month. Bora in
Balmain (Sydney), 59 years ago, Cobden
has had over 40 years with the N.S.W.
Government (architecturally), the last 15
as Government Architect. Except, that
is, for a four-year break doing a bit of
demolishing with the original Ist
Battalion, Old A.I.F.
The recent passing of Dr. Otto Wunder-
lich leaves only Alfred of the three
brothers who, bora in London, educated
there and in Switzerland, took off in
different directions but came together
round about the turn of the century to
start in Sydney one of the city’s most
successful businesses, one for which none
of them had any special training. Otto
was medicoing in London before he left
for the Boer War, to meet Australians and
like what he saw so much that he landed
in Sydney in 1900, to join the tile and
terra-cotta business Alfred and Ernest had
begun. The manufacturing processes and
more exact system of costing he evolved,
in addition to his far-sighted profit-
sharing scheme, are now widely accepted
in Australian business. Alfred Wunder-
lich, now 85, is still chairman of the firm
established in 1887.
In Lieut.-General Sir Charles Gairdner,
Westralia gets a distinguished soldier and
sportsman for its new Governor. Joining
the British Army in the middle of War I,
he served in France and Flanders, got
command of the 10th Royal Hussars just
before War II broke out, and, in the
Middle East, was Deputy Director of
Plans before taking over the British 6th
Armored Division in 1942. For three
years after the war he was the Prime
Minister’s special representative in the Far
East. Hailing from County Galway, 53,
he has represented Ireland at hockey
and once won the Dutch Amateur Golf
Championship.
“K”: Died in London of a brain tumor at
54 Lieut.-Colonel Vladimir Peniakolf, D.S.U.,
M.C. —O.C. the late Popski’s Private Army of
the Western Desert and Italy, whose book, pub-
lished last year, spread his Eighth Army tame
throughout the English-speaking world. He
was, as he wrote of himself, bom in Belgium
“to Russian parents of an intellectual type now
extinct: they showed an old-fashioned turn or
mind in having me taught English as my hrst
language.” In 1914 he entered Cambridge
“with scientific ambitions,” and left in 1915 to
become a gunner in the French Army because
it would take too long to train for a Bntisn
commission. Invalided out in 1918, he went
to Egypt and took service in a sugar factory,
where in the long breaks between sugar-seasons
he fell under the spell of travel in the desert.
From 1930 till 1939 he taught himself to navi-
gate the Egyptian desert in a Ford car he had
specially fitted, living bard and making triends
with chiefs of small Arab tribes.
He introduced himself to the Eighth Army
during Wavell’s first offensive through his ser-
vice with the Libyan Arab Force, of refugees
from Cyrenaica. On the disbandment of that
I rather useless unit he selected some 20 ot its
best men and got headquarters’ approval of a
scheme to organise intelligence far behind me
Italo-German lines. His hunting-ground was
the Jebel el Akhdar, or Green Mountains,
stretching for 170 miles along the coastal
hinterland from Dema to Benghazi. Popski s
seniors in this work were Colonel Bagnold ana
his colleagues in the Long Range Desert Group,
in which were enlisted the pick of the Army,
and which ranged from Tripoli to Lake Chad.
It was through Bagnold that Popski hrst learned
that the Army called him by that name: No-
body can understand Peniakoff on the tele-
phone; do you mind?” When, just before
Alamein, his small unit was hastily regularised
by being put on the establishment, and he ob-
jected to its being called “No. 1 Demolition
Squadron,” the officer on Montgomery’s head-
quarters said “Well, you had better find a name
for it quick or we shall call you Popski’s Pri-
vate Army.” “I’ll take that,” said Popski, and
so it remained through to Tunis, to the Italian
landing and up to the finish of the Italian
campaign. , , ..
Some of Popski’s most sensational exploits
were behind the German lines in Italy—such
as his camping between two German tank de-
tachments on a hillside and his escape at dusk
after making them fire into each other; and
his ringing up a German area commandant and
offering (in Italian) two cases of cognac, and,
the bait taken, driving to the German’s office
with two boxes of bricks, hitting the German
over the head with a cosh, taking his papers
and then, repassing the sentries, returning to
his wireless-truck and reporting to Eighth Army
details of the German strength in the whole
of that rear area. Near Venice one German
commander was bluffed by Popski’s 2/i.e. into
surrendering to 15 men his force of 700, along
with three batteries of artillery, 120 heavy
machine-guns and three months’ supplies.
Of all the fighting men he met Popski liked
best the New Zealanders. He “loved England
with a somewhat ridiculous fervor” and most
things English, with the marked exception,
apparently, of H.M. Brigade of Guards.
Old Digger H. L. Fisk (sth Pioneer
Battalion) last week became S. Australia’s
chief traverser, taking over the Surveyor-
Generalship from A. D. Smith. Appro-
priately enough, he entered the public
service through the Lands Office, junior
clerk in 1909.
“X.S.”: Probably unique, the offer by
abo. artist Albert Namatjira of £lOOO to
endow aboriginal research at the Uni-
verity of Adelaide. The offer-just after
Namatjira, who pays taxes, had been
refused permission to build a home for
himself in Alice Springs—was not made
directly by the artist but through J. K.
Moir, of the Melbourne Bread and Cheese
Club’ who got the money from the book
on Namatjira’s art, published by the club
under C. P. Mountford’s editorship; the
notion, however, came from Namatjira.
It might be classed as a brilliant example
of social satire ; Dean Swift couldn t have
done better, though he would probably
have made it a gift for whiteman research.
“Macnell”: The Admiralty’s new First
Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Rhoderick
McGrigor, did. most of his two-war
fighting in the anything-but-pacific seas
lapping his own Island—which could
account for the tight-lipped, wind-
narrowed look he wears. Son of a
general, married to a colonel’s daughter,
“Wee Mac” (very unofficially) first
tasted salt at a little over 12, was in
destroyers in the Dardanelles and a
battleship at Jutland, and, soon after
muzzle-covers were again stowed in
1939, took the bridge of battle-cruiser
Renown —he had the 4th Destroyer
Flotilla earlier. In on the Bismarck hunt
(though he did not sight her), he later
commanded the naval side of the Sicily
invasion, then the famed Ist Cruiser
Squadron, one of his exploits there being
the savaging of a German convoy which
ran into his guns one black night off
Norway. Now 58, he relieves Admiral
of the Fleet Bruce Fraser, well-known to
R.A.N, men in the Pacific part of their
late war.
Mrs. /Eneas Gunn, of Hawthorn, Mel-
bourne, will be interested in an auction-
sale in Brisbane on July 25—the property
being put up is the huge cattle-station
Elsey, which she immortalised in We of
the Never Never. It is 48 years since
she left it, and none of the people on it
imagined that the little woman would
make them and it world-famous. Since
1914 it has been ruled by the Thonemann
family, of Melbourne, and has been the
pet of Harold Eric Thonemann, stock-
broker and one-time M.L.A. for Toorak.
He used it as a more-or-less socialistic
experiment in elevating the abo., native
mothers getting child-endowment long
before their white sisters.
Maoriland Royal Society’s Sidey Medal
and prize go to Victor Albert Bailey,
Sydney University’s Professor of Experi-
mental Physics. Born in Egypt, he got his
M.A. and D. Phil, from Oxford, and later
lectured there on engineering science and
physics. His latest prize (he holds the
Walter Burfitt prize of the N.S.W. Royal
Society) was in connection with research
in the study of light and other solar
emanations. Lindrum’s game is his pet
pastime.
Square-cut by Coventry, Dr. Robert
McCulloch, principal of South Australia’s
Roseworthy College. Bom in the
Riverina, son of a farmer, McCulloch
was his State’s Rhodes Scholar for 1926,
and at Oxford specialised in researching
into classification of sheep blowflies. Out
of that came some solid service to Aus-
tralian graziers, as well as appointment,

in 1941, to the presidency of the N.S.W.
branch of the Institute of Agricultural
Science. Shifting to pests of the New
Guinea Digger, McCulloch studied scrub
typhus during his Army service in the
islands, and wrote a thesis on its control,
which last year brought him his Doc-
torate of Science. A straight-backed 46,
he still pulls a handy oar—-having been
spare-man in the Oxford crew.
Heth pictures this week the business-
wise face of Sir Harry Brown, of 8.G.E.,
one-time of the P.M.G., chairman with
the former, Director-General of Posts and
Telegraphs with the latter. Born in
England, schooled at Durham College in
Newcastle-on-Tyne, Sir Harry brought
25 years’ British post-office experience
with him to Australia, in 1923, to remain
ARMATURES.
boss of Posts and Telegraphs for the next
17 years. In War II he was Common-
wealth Co-ordinator-General of Works, a
big title for a big job—it covered the
building of just about everything used
in the war effort, from camps and roads
to docks and wharf-sheds. He best
remembers, however, the time when civil
aviation was feeling its wings in
Australia. As witness of his helpful
interest therein, his office wall holds,
in honored retirement, one of the
propellers of the Southern Cross
shattered at one end when Kmgsford
Smith and P. G. Taylor were flying the
first air-mail to New Zealand in May,
1935, and bearing a presentation plaque
from Smithy himself. Now 72, Sir Harry
staunchly believes in the basic solidity of
the Australian worker.
On a retirement-holiday in Australia,
Professor Matthew Stewart has been do-
ing a spot of lecturing to Sydney patho-
logists. He knows a bit about that,
having, for the past 32 years been pro-
fessor of the subject at Leeds University,
as well as examiner in it for years at
Oxford and Cambridge, for 10 other
British universities and the Czech Govern-
ment. In 44 years’ medicomg he s
amassed a long list of honors, and
recreates with medieval churches ana
walking—he’ll find enough of the latter
in present-day Sydney.
Into the Silence:
In Perth, at 75, William Joseph Mann, news-
paperman and South-west Province representa-
tive in the Westrahan Legislative Council since
1926 Founder of the Busselton “South-Western
News,” he later climbed to president ot the
Australian Provincial Press (1923 to 1925), and
represented the Federal organisation at the
Empire Press Union Conference m London,
1930. His Parliamentary experience took m
membership of several Select Committees and
the Deputy Presidency of the Council.
At Hay (N.S.W.), at 55, Judge Joseph
Lamaro, one of Transport Minister Sheahan s
night-school classmates in Law at Sydney Uni-
versity. One-time Minister of Justice and
Attorney-General in the Lang Government,
he retired from politics after failing to win a
Federal seat, and reached the District Court
Bench in 1947. He was a signaller in France
with the 18th Battalion, Old A.I.F.
At 48, in Melbourne, A. O. Yuncken, lead-
ing architect, whose organising ability found
expression in War II in personal surveys by air
of enemy-held positions suitable tor hospua
sites after Allied landings. Then he pushe
through a programme for supplying prefabn-
cated 500-bed hospitals to war zones. The U.h.
Army appointed him consulting-architect to Us
forces. In 1924 he rescued a friend from a end
on Mount Pilot, in the Australian Alps, at great
risk, and got the Royal Humane Society’s gold
medal.

TO THE FOOD INDUSTRY
In the highly competitive food industry
there is wide recognition that im-
provement in the nation's food benefits
everybody.
At the last reckoning, the 6,340 estab-
lishments engaged in this industry
employed 103,617 Australians who were
paid £38,350,000 in wages.
Over £36,978,000 has been invested in
the plant and machinery necessary for
maintaining our standard of food, yet
every processor needs his bank every
day of the year.
This Bank provides a full banking service
for concerns in all industries. Its
managers are always ready to discuss
this service with anyone needing it.

The evening dance on the

they are three deep. The escort-

policeman’s job for amusement.
And sparring-partners.
Over the Tropic of Capricorn.
Engine trouble. A twenty-inch
piston-head lies across the oil-
spattered metal floor. Chief
engineer swaps his gold-braided
jacket for a black singlet. The
engines recover; resume their
old tempo. Eight thousand
horse-power swinging a twenty-
foot propeller, seventy revolu-
tions a minute. Instructors
drudge through the boring days.
The end of the Indian Ocean,
Lower temperatures; quieter
passengers.
Around Cape Leeuwin. Pas-
sengers arrange themselves into
national choirs to sing nostalgic
hymns. Fatigue invades veins
and tissues, flows through every
muscle-fibre and soaks deep
into the bones. I acquire the
brisk resilient spirit of a
witchety-grub.
Across the Great Bight to
Cape Otway. Slipping the long
even swells that roll up from the
Antarctic. Half-past midnight
I go up to the darkened wheel-
house for a last look over the
moonlit decks. The duty officer
is smoking lazily in the glow of
the Sperry-gyro compass. We
drink black tea, talk about
Sydney, sharks, surf, snakes,
Tilly Devine, desert warfare,
copra at seventy-pounds a ton,
shipping timber from Strahan to
Geelong.
Eight bells. The Southern
Cross fades before us. Navi-
gational computations are com-
pleted ; the position plotted.
The Admiralty Chart is com-
piled from the latest informa-
tion in the Hydrographic
Office. Eighteen-eighty-four.
Caution. In approaching
King Island. .,. .Many fatal
wrecks have occurred on this
island, apparently from errors in
reckoning.
I go down to my cabin, fall
asleep as the first sunlight
strikes through the window. A
brown-winged albatross sails
through the early dawn. I
awake. Happy.
It is one of those fresh, clean
mornings that lift the tearing
sadness right out of your soul
and make all worry and weari-
ness seem unreasonable and
childish. The steward leaves a
case of beer; cold off the ice.
Captain, officers and nurses
jam into my homelet. Foam-
ing long glasses, high spirits,
bawdy jokes, tuneless songs.
“W here did you learn
French?” asks the skipper.
I am speaking German.
In the saloon twenty-six
educational staff assemble for
the farewell-party. Dry dry
Martinis, coffee, cream cakes,
cigarettes, trimmings and
speeches.
“Here’s a toast,” I say. “To
the ship, gallant lady of the
seas.”
The skipper appears. We
toast him. Senior teacher
Kurce speaks well. I reply. I
shake hands twenty-six times.
THE cabin-window frames
Victoria’s rocky promon-
tory. In the breakfast saloon
the radio is selling soap in a
vulgar Australian snarl. Pas-
sengers begin stacking luggage
topside preparatory for landfall.
I watch them struggling. I re-
member riff-raff refugees chok-
ing European roads during war
years. Thousands and tens of
thousands. Driven by fear and
want, weighted with cumber-
some accoutrements. Peram-
bulators, bulging suitcases,
stoves, children, bundles, hand-
carts.
GOLDEN Australian beaches
glide by. The ship’s company
becomes happy, considerate,
friendly with each other. The
ship moves up the lovely harbor
into the sunset. Fifteen hundred
passengers grow lyrical about
the beauty before them. The
Harbor Bridge filigreed against a
golden back-drop, flocks of
Saturday sail-craft, Bradley’s
Head, Garden Island, Fort
Denison, Kirribilli.
“I never shall this country
leave,” resolves ace student
Rubicek.
Zodowicz is smiling. I take
a good hard look.
Farewells and handshakes.
Passengers entrain and the
ship’s company dines as Sydney
tugs swing us back into the har-
bor. We stand on the deck for
the glide through the Heads.
What now? Ah, yes! As the
silent ship grows alive with the
motion of the first heavy swells,
and the light of day fades, I
assemble bodies in my cabin,
dispense gin and radio music,
hilarious gaiety for a few hours.
For being alone now is unbear-
able.
As day breaks I empty over-
flowing ash-trays, evict recum-
bent bodies, sleepily wash
glasses, push orange-peels and
bottletops under the carpet, rub
the table dry of spilt alcohol,
lie on the sunny deck to re-
cuperate.
The ship is mournful and
lonely without fifteen hundred
migrants.

HOW is the time to
INSULATE YOUR HOME
against HEAT a COLD
If your home is still in course of erection why
not get information on how to insulate for all
time against extremes of weather. No home is
truly modern which is stifling in summer and
unpleasantly cold in winter. You save on
heating costs too! Even if your home is com-
pleted, it’s still not too late to INSULATE.

Australian Defence .
NOW that most of the
youth of Australia is
being called to the colors
it is worth while to
recall how this country was de-
fended in its earliest years—long
before any Australians had
thought of doing so seriously.
From the arrival of the First
Fleet in 1788, for a period of
over 80 years, the defence of
Australia was almost entirely
entrusted to Britain, and not
until the last two decades of this
long stretch of time was the
question of local defence con-
sidered by any section of the
inhabitants of this country. The
following is an almost complete
list of the various British mili-
tary units which from time to
time did duty in the South Seas
—exclusive of those engaged in
the Maori wars—but omits to
mention several companies of
Royal Artillery and Royal En-
gineers occasionally drafted to
Australia and Tasmania. It is
noticeable, from the way in
which the service in Australia
of some of the regiments over-
laps that of others, that now
and then the Australian garrison
was a fairly large one. These
were the corps that served in
this country between 1810 and
1870.
The 73rd (Black Watch),
1810-1814; the 46th (South
Devon), 1814-1818; the 48th
(Northamptonshire), 1817-1824;
the 3rd (Buffs), 1823-1827; the
40th (2nd Somersetshire), 1824-
1829 ; the 57th (West Middle-
sex), 1825-1832; the 39th
(Dorsetshire), 1827-1832 ; the
63rd (West Suffolk), 1829-1833 ;
the 17th (Leicestershire), 1830-
1836 ; the 4th (The King’s Own),
1832-1837 ; the 50th (West
Kent), 1833-1841 ; the 21st
(Royal North British Fusiliers),
1833-1839 ; the 28th (North
Gloucestershire), 1835 - 1842 ;
80th (Staffordshire Volunteers),
1837-1844; the 51st (2nd York-
shire West Riding Light In-
fantry), 1838-1846; the 96th,
1841-1848; the 99th (Lanark-
shire), 1842-1856 ; the 58th (Rut-
landshire), 1844-1847 ; the 11th
(North Devonshire), 1845-1857 ;
the 65th (2nd Yorkshire North
Riding), 1846-1849; the 4ffth
(2nd Somersetshire), 1852-1860 ;
the 12th (East Suffolk), 1854-
1861 ; the 77th (East Middlesex),
1857-1858 ; the 50th (West
Kent), 1866-1869 ; the 14th
(Buckinghamshire), 1867-1870;
the 18th (Royal Irish), 1870-
1870.
The first garrison consisted of
four companies of Royal
Marines, totalling in officers,
n.c.os. and men fewer than 200.
They were replaced in 1791-92
by a regiment, the New South
Wales Corps, which had been
specially raised for service in
Australia. At the beginning of
the 19th century Governor
Hunter, alarmed at the possi-
bility of revolt on the part of the
Irish political prisoners crowded
into the colony after the rebel-
lion of 1798, raised two small
companies of volunteers at Syd-
ney and Parramatta, who were
styled “The Loyal and Associ-
ated Crops.” Owing to a diffi-
culty in finding officers they were
disbanded by Governor King in
1801, but were reconstituted as
“The Loyal Association” in
1803. When Macquarie arrived,
at the end of 1809, he brought
orders for the return of the
N.S.W. Corps, and hencefor-
ward, for 60 years, the garrison
was composed of the regiments
listed above.
THE story of the fortification
of Port Jackson is an in-
teresting one, and is replete with
evidence of the anxiety shared
by successive Governors as to
the more or less defenceless
state of the seat of government.
In July, 1788, Lieutenant Wil-
liam Dawes was ordered to con-
struct a redoubt on Benelong
Point, and it was finished and
armed with two guns by the end
of the year. In 1791 the same
officer constructed a battery on
the point which still bears his
name. Governor Hunter placed
a larger armament in the Bene-
long Point defences in 1798, and
mounted some guns on Garden
Island. Governor King installed
a battery on George’s Head in
1801, and in 1804 commenced
the building of a fort on the
present site of the Observatory,
the incompleted walls of which
—it was to have been a hexa-
gon, mounting four guns on
each face —may still be seen be-
neath the flagstaff of the signal-
station.
During the reign of Governor
Macquarie the battery at Dawes
Point was strengthened, and
Fort Macquarie was built on
Benelong Point, only being re-
moved to make way for the pre-
sent tramway depot at the be-
ginning of this century. Mac-
quarie designed other and more
complete defences for Sydney
Harbor, but the necessity for re-
trenchment caused the neglect
of the existing fortifications, and
in i 827 Governor Darling
pleaded to the Colonial Office
that the capital was “totally
destitute of every military de-
fence,” and requested that an
engineer officer should be sent
out to report. But it was not
until 1835 that anything was
done. In that year, as a sop to
the persistent complaints of
Governor Bourke, Captain
George Barney, R.E., was sent
out to Sydney and another en-
gineer officer to Hobart Town.
Friend of Sad Men .
OLD SYDNEY JAIL
stood on the south-
western corner of
George-street and Essex-
street. A little way up the slope
of the latter thoroughfare there
still exists what used to be
known as “Gallows Hill,” where
Sydney crowds of the period
attended the entertainments fre-
quently provided for their edifi-
cation by the Sheriff and his
assistants.
The prison was a gloomy
place, shockingly overcrowded
with criminals and the-not-so-
criminal, and always there were
wretched men amongst them to
whom the hill behind loomed as
its most imminent terror. Very
little in alleviation of their lot
came to these unfortunates, but
there was one red-headed man
from Cork who came as a ray
of sunlight into the miserable
enclosure which bounded their
diminishing prospects of life—
John Joseph Therry, the Catho-
lic chaplain. From his biography
by Monsignor E. M. O’Brien —
one of the soundest essays in
Australian history ever pub-
lished —the following passages
demonstrate very clearly the sort
of good man Father Therry
must have been,
“Day or night he was ready
to attend the cell of the worst
criminal. His figure, passing or
stopping to say a word of en-
couragement at each cell, be-
came part of the daily routine.
He was with them in the fac-
tory, the exercise-yard and the

When steps seem a little

more irksome, it’s time to heed nature’s warning signals.
After 40, most men and women find their system requires
extra care . . . and thousands have found the help they
need in Wolfe’s Schnapps. Known and proved for genera-
tions, Wolfe’s Schnapps is the purest of spirits, a safe
stimulant and diuretic, and possesses medicinal properties
found in no other spirit. With ice-cold water, soft drinks,
lemon or cordial, it is a pleasant drink and a tonic with
lasting beneficial effects. Some also prefer
Wolfe's -Schnapps hot with lemon at bedtime.

INVEST IN
HADDON RIG BLOOD!
Today’s bumper wool cheques are not due solely
to unprecedented demands. The heaviest
gainers are those who have looked well ahead.
They have recognised the remarkable worth of
Haddon Rig Blood, and are benefiting by their
foresight and judgment. If you are anxious to
safeguard future profits, you will carry forward
some of today’s profits in the form of Haddon
Rig Blood.
Haddon Rig sires are distinguished by massive
frames, true conformation and dense, soft-
handling wool. They are renowned, too, for
high lambing percentages, unusual adapt-
ability and other valuable characteristics. At the
1950 Sydney Ram Sales, Haddon Rig Stud
dominated the bidding. 148 Haddon Rig Rams
averaged £296/5/- to realise £43,853/5/-,
further striking proof of the tremendous value
placed on Haddon Rig Blood. Comprising only
15% of the total rams sold, the Haddon Rig
team realised approximately 30% of total
Merino Ram Sales.,

road-gangs. And they knew
their man. Many a letter was
passed surreptitiously, through
the agency of a tradesman or an
indulgent Catholic warder, to the
hands of the Catholic chaplain.
And these are letters —to our
surprise—in great part from
Protestant convicts asking some
favor from one whom they did
not scruple to call their dear
friend and speaking eloquently
for Father Therry’s worth and
work. They breathe forth an
atmosphere of trust and an ap-
preciation of the goodness and
kindness of the man who gave
his whole heart to their welfare.
One we give here, but the blood-
smeared paper and the scrawl as

transcription follows;

“Of letters from the jai
warders, this is a specimen:
Revd. Sir; I respectfully beg leave
to acquaint you that Joseph Lockett
is ordered for execution on Monday
next. He is a Protestant but wishes
to die a Catholic. Yours obt. servant,
John Toole.
“With a change of names this
may stand for practically all the
warders’ letters. Often a prisoner
could not write, or perhaps was
a Protestant and ignorant of the
correct terms in which to address
a priest. He would seek out
some comrade in distress, who
would convey his message to
Father Therry;
To the revemd Mr. terry. Sir there
one of the young men in the sells
sadley troubled and wishes to see you
very pertickler for he bursted in teers
last night and cryed out for your
assistence so that i hope you will
come to his assistence.
JOHN WALL.

It is hardly to be won-
dered at that such a man as these
pathetic documents reveal their
recipient to have been should
make many converts to his
church. Those who begged for
conversion might have been
weak in dogma, but they must
have trusted implicitly as a
human being the redheaded
priest from Cork.
RAIN ON THE ROOF.
Listen—be a child—
To the scattering of wild
Rain on the roof.
The hilltop wether’s cough;
To the swollen sound
w/um 16 * 0 ” rops on ground
While the magpie’s note
Makes runnels of his throat
Waking the drowsy tree
To a green memory
And the crow on the wire
a hundred eyes for hire
As down the sheep-pad’s flow
Clouds and hoggets go
Head to tail
In the silvering of a snail:
Tor this is the weather
Stockmen stitch harness leather,
The fettler s irons glow
Lwike a robin on a boughi
And boys stamp by the pool
To still the cricket’s call—
A time for fires at night
When wind thieves lantern light.

Milder and a child study by
Dora Jarret, The second
obvious feature of the exhibi-
tion is the absence of Norman
Lindsay.
Eldershaw’s paintings record
the color and flatness and heat
of Central Australia in “Desert
Range,” the age and solidity of
rock in “Outcrop” and a fine sky
and clouds over magnificent
folded hills in “Sheep Country,
Riverina,” In “Rock Pool” he
succumbs to the fatal fascination
which outlandish natural fea-
tures seem to exercise—the great
bulk of brilliant red rock is no
doubt as true as it is incredible,
but neither point makes it a
work of art.
Ragless has three paintings:
“Tasmania Coastline,” over-
balancing with a heavy patch of
blue paint, “King River, Tas-
mania,” better balanced but
rather unnaturally bright in
color, and—the one which takes
the eye—“ Mount McKinlay,
Flinders Range,” a large land-
scape with feeling for grandeur
and the sweep of distance. The
one objection that might be
made to it is that its three main
colors—the brown of the fore-
ground, the pinkish-mauve of
the middle distance and the
smoky blue of the background
—tend to separate into three
distinct bands.
The feeling that the meticu-
lous draughtsman sometimes
overrides the artist in G. K.
Townshend’s paintings is both
justified and contradicted.
“Quarry, Bombo,” is a finely-
drawn and detailed record of
rocks and water, but misses the
feeling of conflict —the force of
water against immovable rock —
that might be expected; but in
“Landscape, Dee Why,” the
artist and draughtsman are in
admirable accord in a brown-
grey study of a house, trees,
dead saplings and misty distance.
Yvonne de Moulin’s paintings
are all pleasantly attractive
harmonies in line and soft
browns and greens; “Street of
Old Houses, Ryde,” fits that
formula very well, and there is
an appropriate cheerful jaunti-
ness about “Captain’s Shack.”
One might spend a lot of time
comparing and contrasting the
flowerpieces by Margaret Coen
and Nornie Gude —there is a
vital freshness about the former
and a blaze of color; they are
alive and their stems are drink-
ing the water in the glass bowl;
the painting, in its reds and gold
and white, is a recognition of
flowers as gay and beautiful
things. On the other hand,
Norriie Gude, with graceful,
swept arrangement, sees them as
a soft, graceful subject in pale
blues, pink and white. Both
paintings, one a clear vivid state-
ment, the other a lovely impres-
sion, are outstanding.
Brett Hilder’s head study
“Kiro of Maoriland,” is slight in
text, but full of character; and
Dora Jarret’s “Kindergarten”
records light and life and the
charm of thoughtful infancy.
Rah Fizelle’s “Pastoral, South
France,” has a cool green pattern
of trees against a vague blue
bulk of hills, and there is a
quiet pensive clarity about his
“Anna” and “By the Window.”
Ronald Steuart shows “Bush
Piece,” “The Ferry” and “At
Long Reef,” all of them charac-
terised by his fine, graceful line
and practically unerring selective
economy of both Line and color ;
as well as her flowerpiece, Mar-
garet Coen has two landscapes,
“River, Duckmaloi,” with its
quiet depth of water, and
“Goodradigbee,” with sunlight
filtering through trees; D.
Orban’s “Balmain” is as heavy
and dark and crowded as
his “Morning in the Valley”
is light and airy; W. R.
F. Richardson has three
direct studies in grey and green
of “Canal Bridge, Dublin,”
“Harbor, Penzance,” and “Corfe
Castle, Dorset”; Ronald
Fletcher has a slightly more im-
aginative study in the same colors
in “Harmony in Greys”; A.
Gamble has two overcolored
paintings in “Texan Landscape”
and “San Jose, Texas,” and two
more-satisfactorily subdued in
color in “San Juan Bautista”
and “Gautemala City.”
O. F.
Salvana's Landscapes.
To see John Salvana’s land-
scapes at David Jones’s Gallery,
Sydney, is to go into the Aus-
tralian countryside on a sunny
day; and though there are
schools of thought which say
you should go only on a wet
day, or that you should look for
the bones of the hills and have
fits of melancholia, or that you
should pretend you are in
Europe, it is still, surely, both
legitimate and pleasant to go
wandering with an artist so un-
pretentious and so honest.
There is a personal warmth
in these paintings, as well as the
accidental warmth of Australian
light. Salvana obviously loves
the earth; and he paints it, if
not with the lyrical intensity of
a Gruner, or the dramatic
breadth of a Streeton, at least in
sturdy and capable prose. He
likes homely things: the little
homestead of the struggling
cocky, the red roof under the
weather-beaten pines, the bare
yard and the cows: and why
not?
When he tries, admirably
enough, to extend his range into
big mountain landscapes or a
forest of tall timber his limita-
tions become apparent; the
paint is smeary, no light comes
through the trees, the horizon
is a wall of paint. There is a
large canvas, but there is no
depth of feeling or finesse of
technique to justify it.
But when, as in the 18 paint-
ings from No. 24 to No. 41 on
his catalogue, he confines him-
self to some simple statement
about a bit of the earth blazing
gold in the noonday sun or a
rich clump of trees in a hollow,
he is always worth listening to ;
and the two smallest oils, “River
Flats Near Mudgee” and “The
Ever-Changing Sky, Cudgegong”
are probably the best of the lot.
The pictures, as they deserve
to, have been selling excep-
tionally well.
The Contemporaries.
For the first time for many
years it is possible to see the
Contemporary Art Society’s ex-
hibition in Sydney. It has
moved from the Education De-
partment Galleries to Farmer’s,
where the walls are clean and
the light clear; and the Society
has wisely cut down the number
of its exhibits from about a
million to a modest 147.
On the whole, except for one
or two regulars such as George
Duncan, it looks like a students’
show. As the young revolu-
tionaries acquire a technique and
some maturity of outlook they
tend to drift away to the Society
of Artists.
There are, of course, the usual
exercises in surrealist and
abstract art, all rather stereo-
typed ; and there are the usual
crudities which are not experi-
mental but simply inefficient.
And, here and there, are the
occasions when something of
vitality or promise may be dis-
cerned through a coarse or
sketchy technique: P. Beau-
mont’s “Seascape,” Lesley H.
Brash’s “High Tide,” Margaret
Pearce’s “Bush Road,” N. V.
Hawkins’s “Trees at Mona
Vale,” Edward J. Sackey s
“Petrified Forest” and Margo
Lewers’s “Xmas Tree.”
Carl Plate’s “Butterflies on a
Red Ground” neatly avoids
sentimentality without edging
too much into harshness; and
among the sculptures there is a
pleasing “Hawk” in igneous
basalt by G. F. Lewers.
Menuhin.
It is impossible to imagine any
violinist with a more complete
command over the varied re-
sources of his instrument, or
able to conjure from it a warmer
or richer tone, and do it all with
a maximum of facility and a
minimum of fuss, than Yehudi
Menuhin, who hoisted the first
Sydney Town Hall “Full House”
sign of the season last Saturday.
His programme was a formid-
able one. In the Brahms D
Minor Sonata, Op. 108, he
mixed poesy with forthrightness
and vigor to fascinating effect.
Bartok’s Sonata, unaccom-
panied, is, as music, a mass of
noise; but it is a wonderful col-
lection of technical difficulties,
well integrated. Through these
Menuhin swept in devastating
fashion with brilliant bowing and
fingering. But the night’s furore
was reserved for his rendition of
that most loved ,of all the violin
concert!, the Mendelssohn; his
playing reaching its pitch in the
poignant stream of the lovely
andante.
“Elektra,” Richard Strauss’s
one-act tragic opera based on
Sophocles, and presented in con-
cert form with Marjorie Law-
rence and the Symphony Or-
chestra under Goossens, pos-
sesses orchestration of wondrous
richness but a score for the
human voice which for stark un-
loveliness has only one parallel:
Debussy’s “Pelleas and Meli-
sande,” Argument has been
adduced that this is in keeping
with the heaviness of the tragedy.
Nonsense. “Otello” is heavy
tragedy, yet to it Verdi coupled
his greatest score. If it is exact-
ing for the audience it is even
more so for the singers. Elektra
herself is a role of punishing
severity, and had it not been for
Miss Lawrence’s magnificent
singing of it the night would
have been intolerable. The
whole voice-score is badly
balanced. Except for a couple
of bars in the first minute, no
male voice is heard for the next
45, and thereafter only sketchily.
Too often the orchestra drowned
the other singers. These were
Phyllis Rogers, Heather Kin-
naird, Lorraine Davis, Allan
Ferris, Frank Lisle and John
Young.

THE
CHAMPION
HORSEBREAKER
by DAL STIVENS
WE were sitting around on
the veranda, as mourn-
ful as a trio of blistered
bandicoots on a burnt-
out ridge because the old man’s
plough was at the bottom of the
estuary and the corn paddock
was not turned, when we heard
a click at the gate down on the
road. We looked up then and
saw a sinewy-looking bloke,
almost too thin to throw a
shadow on a hot day, with a
face the color of old saddle-
leather, coming up from the
road and leading a neat little
mare that was lame in the near
hind hoof.
We yelled to him to watch
out for the colts, but he just
grinned, and kept on coming,
scarcely bothering to throw a
look where they were kicking
the dairy to pieces, racing up to
it full gallop and letting fly with
their hooves as they passed, so
that the planks took off and
sailed for yards through the air.
When the big bay with the
crocodile head caught sight of
the long lean bloke walking up
on his bowed legs he took a
couple of skippety steps forward
and then stopped, and he and
the other five bundles of prob-
lem horseflesh now hung back
as bashful as a mob of school-
girls when a new young good-
looking master arrives. Big
black clouds were coming over-
head, and it was beginning to
spit rain in drops as big as two-
bob bits.
The bloke came up to the
veranda, and when we saw he
had a big coil of rawhide rope
on his arm we knew his name
almost as soon as he introduced
himself to the old man in these
words:
“They call me Rawhide
Harry. They tell me there’s a
job for me here breaking-in
those obstreperous colts of
yours. You can do anything
with rawhide.”
While Rawhide Harry, the
champion horseman and horse-
breaker of the whole North
Coast, was talking the rangy
bay colt minced up and poked
his head over the veranda-rail,
and now he throws up his head
and neighs very rudely, showing
his graveyard teeth.
“I could tame that piece of
lion’s tucker in half a day,” says
Rawhide, not turning round. “I
could make him so polite he
would think he was going gay
if he was allowed to pull a
hearse.”
“Rawhide,” says the old man,
making a part in his beard with
a finger, “I’ve heard of you, but
I’ve no work for you. All I
want is my plough back from
the bottom of the Pacific Ocean
so I can turn that big paddock
over. I don’t care about any-
thing else.”
XX/HEN he hears these words
* * the bay colt neighs again
and then pounds off to the out-
house and proceeds to kick it to
bits. The planks split as though
they had been axed, and, in be-
tween clouts with his hind
hooves, the colt stops his work
to sneer with all his teeth in our
Mr. Stivens has been relaxing
in London with a little broad-
casting. This story was given
in the 8.8. C. Third Programme
recently.
direction, And, inspired by his
example, the other colts begin
making short work of the hen-
house, the barn, the pig-pen, the
silo and the corn-shed. It is
starting to rain fairly heavily by
this time.
While the colts are busy the
old man doesn’t turn a hair, but
gazes steadily out to sea. After
a bit he explains over his shoul-
der for Rawhide’s benefit: “It
is true the colts have got a bit
out of hand since I lost my
plough, but the sheds can be re-
placed. But not my plough, and,
meanwhile, the paddock below
the house isn’t turned over and
the corn isn’t planted.”
Rawhide’s bushy eyebrows are
turning into two question-marks,
and he is about to open his
mouth when suddenly the old
man starts jumping up and
down like a greyhound pup with
a bee-sting under his tail. The
old man is pointing with a
finger at the estuary, and far
out we see the mud swirling up
in clouds to the top of the water
and the weed coming up in cart-
loads, and we hear Boompty!
Boomp! as the plough snags on
a rock on the river-bed, and we
hear Uuurrr ! as the great-great-
grandfather of all the giant
groper in the Pacific Ocean
grunts and tugs and heaves that
plough off the rock.
RAWHIDE turns his head
when he hears the noise
coming up from the ocean-bed
and looks questioningly at the
old man.
But the old man begins bel-
lowing :
“There he corkscrews and
canters! There he prances and
pigroots! There he bucks and
bolts! Damnation take that
black barnacled son of a sea-
stallion that is yoked to my
plough! There he twists and
trots!”
Rawhide naturally doesn’t
know what to make of this and
his eyebrows are almost talking
by this time, so we explain how
the old man’s plough comes to
be tugged about the bottom of
the Pacific Ocean by the great-
great-grandsire of all the big
groper between here and the
Gulf of Carpentaria.
It had happened sixteen days
ago when the old man was setting
a line for the big groper that
come in from the sea at this time
of the year. He baited the
hook with a whole rabbit and
tossed it out. The line he meant
to hitch to a five-gallon drum
which the groper could tow until
he tired, but just then the old
man’s pipe went out, so he
looped the line round the handles
of the plough. Before he can
smoke half a box of matches
getting the pipe alight the great-
great-grandfather of all groper
gulps down the rabbit and clears
out with the plough. It heads
for the water at forty miles an
hour with the old man footing
it as hard as he can, but nowhere
in the race.
Three times while the old man
is telling the story, with some
help from my brother Joe and
me, he breaks off to point down
to the waters of the estuary and
each time we hear Boompty!
Boomp! as the plough catches
on a rock, and we hear that old
groper give a grunt as he lugs it
free.
And three times the old man
starts bellowing:
“There he pigroots and
prances! There he bucks and
bolts! There he canters and
corkscrews! There he twists
and trots!”
By this time the colts have
cleaned up everything except the
house and they are even casting
appraising glances at that. The
bay swaggers up, pokes his head
over the rail and nips the old
man on the leg, but the boss
takes little notice except to tear
off the square of cloth which the
colt has cut through with his
teeth.
“I’ll go cantering!” says Raw-
hide, taken aback, and when the
colt edges near for another nip,
he throws back his head, hawks
deep down in his throat and
spits, Clung!, right in the colt’s

dirty-looking eye. The colt
nearly throws a sixer from sur-
prise and pain and retires with
the rest of the mob behind where
the outhouse used to be. It is
raining heavily now.
Boompty! Boomp! and
Uuurrr! comes up again from
far below as the old man puts
it to Rawhide:
“You get my plough back from
that black son of a barnacled
sea-stallion and you can break-in
my horses.”
“It’s a bargain,” says Rawhide.
“I’ve run down the wildest
brumbies on the north coast.
I’ve tamed the most cantanker-
ous outlaws from Bendigo to
Broome. I’ve never yet had any
truck with a creature with fins,
but I expect I’ll manage.”
AND Rawhide hops off the
veranda, unrolling the coil
of greenhide as he goes.
“If I’m to run down this sea-
stallion I’ve got to have a
mount,” he says, heading straight
for the bay colt.
It is raining very heavily, but
Rawhide doesn’t falter. In a
twitch of a rat’s tail he has a
loop round the bay’s neck and
the other end round a big gum-
tree. The colt tosses his head
and bares his teeth in a sneer.
His lips come up so far they
nearly double back into his
nostrils. Then he sets off at a
gallop. The rawhide snaps taut,
but it doesn’t pull the colt up.
In no time he has galloped over
the hill behind the house and
the greenhide, wet from the rain,
is Stretched as fine as a fiddle-
string. You could hear it sing-
ing now like telephone-wires in
a high wind.
“There’s nothing like raw-
hide,” says Rawhide Harry. “It
will hold anything.”
The rain goes away and the
sun comes bounding out again.
The colt is somewhere over the
third hill behind the farm and
the rawhide is now as thin as
cotton. The sun is so hot that
before you can say, “Rawhide
had better be good! ” the rain is
all dried up. Suddenly back in
the fifth hill behind the farm
there is a squawk from the bay
colt, then a thrashing and floun-
dering in the bracken. Then on
the fourth hill behind the farm
there is a mighty crashing as
though half the unbroken colts
on the north coast are flounder-
ing down the hill. But there are
no cries from the colt now. He’s
saving what breath he has left.
Before our eyes the greenhide is
swelling and getting bigger, con-
tracting under the sun’s heat and
hauling that big cheeky rawboned
colt back, first at five miles an
hour, then ten miles an hour,
then twenty miles an hour, over
the third hill at thirty miles an
hour, and then at forty miles
an hour. It yanks him back to
the farm at nearly fifty, and he
fetches up smack against the big
gum. He hits it a fearful wallop,
bits of bark fly off the trunk,
three dead limbs and a possum
are shaken down, and the colt is
knocked silly.
When he comes-to twenty
minutes later, Rawhide has
saddled and bridled him and is
waiting with his feet in the stir-
rups to start something. But the
colt has less kick in him than
an eighty-year-old chorus girl,
and he knows now he is beaten.
In ten minutes he is as docile as
a small boy a few days before
Christmas,
Then, waving the coil of
greenhide. Rawhide Harry heads
the colt out into the estuary,
calling back over his shoulder:
“I’ve never run down one of
these sea-stallions before, but
there always has to be a first
time,”
I N no time he is twenty yards
1 out and the water is up to his
stirrups. And thirty yards out
it is up to his knees. We ex-
pected the colt to strike out
swimming then, but instead Raw-
hide spurs him along the estuary-
bed and horse and rider dis-
appear under the water. For
some minutes we see nothing but
a few bubbles and brown mists
of mud coming up. Then, far
out in the middle of the estuary,
the water boils suddenly and
that dirty big groper vaults clean
out, smacking the water with his
tail like fifty cannon going off
together, and climbs slowly until
he is twenty feet above the sur-
face, He stays floating in the air
for a second or two, shaking his
head and muttering. He looks
as big as the side of a haystack,
black as molasses except for the
green moss and oysters sprout-
ing on his sides. The old man’s
plough is hanging from his lower
jaw.
Rawhide and the colt burst out
after him. Rawhide has the
rope looped to slip round him.
Then the big black codfish flops
back and the spray falls on us
where we are standing on the
beach, and Rawhide spurs the
colt down. Ten times that black
horse of the sea bursts out and
shakes his head and ten times
Rawhide knees the colt into the
air after him. Then the chase
goes down deep to the estuary-
bed, The blue water becomes
brown. Enough pasture for ten
thousand sea-sheep comes float-
ing to the top. And Puufffl
Puuff ! we hear now as the big
groper tires and Rawhide gains
on him. Rawhide’s bubbles and
those of the groper get closer
together.
Then a wake of mud and weed
comes rapidly towards us. Raw-
hide and the colt shoulder the
water to the right and to the
left and gallop up on the beach.
The greenhide stretches tight
behind him and back in the
depths it is fast to the groper.
Rawhide gallops up to the pad-
dock and races right across it
to the righthand comer, with the
wet greenhide tugged thin behind
him. On the other side of the
paddock he rounds the big gum
and comes back towards us.
He crosses and recrosses that
paddock fifty times like he was
playing musical chairs and the
greenhide gets thin as spiderweb
and if you had had a bow you
could have played “Annie
Laurie” on it.
OUR eyes were sticking out
like organ-stops by the time
Rawhide was through, but we
might have cottoned on to what
he was up to. That greenhide
starts to shrink with the hot sun
and that dirty big groper is being
lugged up the beach at five miles
an hour with the plough behind.
The groper has his big lips set as
hard as a publican’s when your
cheque has cut out, and he digs
deep into the sand with his fins.
But he might just as well have
come quietly. In less time than
it takes a woman to change her
mind he has been dragged into
fire paddock and his fins and the
plough have dug furrows right
across it. Before you can say
“Rawhide for ever!” that big
groper is being lugged across the
paddock and round the big gum
and back and round a second
tree and across again and round
a third tree, and so on and so
on.
In next to no time that pad-
dock is all turned over by his
fins and the old man’s plough.
The dirty big groper comes to
rest on the beach with his fins
almost worn down to their
uppers. While we are still
gaping at what we have seen we
hear Rawhide speaking:
“If you don’t mind I’ll skip
the polite conversation. Now
that this little matter is out of
the way. I’ll get on with my job
of breaking-in the colts.”
And he sets off for the house
where the colts are waiting for
him, grinning ingratiatingly with
all five sets of teeth.
MIDNIGHT VISION.
Before the dawn cuts down the midnight Tree
That shelters us with branches bent with stars,
O let us part the foliage of the dark
And lift clear faces in eternal light.
Turn how to me; 1 feel our glances meet
Far beyond earth, sunk in its forest night.
And like a bough of light your arm in mine
Encircles all the midnight dark in me.

Minister Strachey again put out
what must be taken as an official
British Government feeler to-
wards calling off the war in
Korea. The fighting, he saic
should stop at or about th
present line.
Whether this amounts to wis
policy, a humane step, ran
appeasement, or acceptance o
defeat, it has evidently bee
British policy for some time. A
far back as April, Strachey saic
that if, “after the present offen
sive has been beaten off,” th
Chinese still refuse to negotiat
“then the fighting will simp
die away.”
At least one British paper, th
London “Daily Telegraph,
thought little of this as a polio
stating that it “assumes tha
there will be neither negotiatio
nor fighting nor peace.” Tha
it added, “would indeed be £
curious way of teaching aggres
sors a lesson, which is th
reason why we are in Korea
all. It is the quintessence o:
inanition. If the Chinese rejec
a settlement by negotiation then
one must be imposed on them
and it can only be imposed b
fighting.”
Comment in the always acut
London “Economist” indicatec
how the Strachey statement
might appear to the other side
“That the Western Govern
ments, whose men are fighting
in Korea, from time to time
openly disagree ; that the United
Nations takes weeks to agree
even on a simple definition oi
aims ; that public opinion in the
United States and Britain is con
stantly forcing statesmen into
reassuring statements about the
limits they will set to their
strategy—all this must appear in
Moscow and Peking as a sure
sign of failing stamina, of lack
of political support for the fight-
ing men.”
In the “Economist’s” view
“The whole difference between
the two sides may be summec
up in one sentence: to the Com-
munists victory means the tota
defeat of the United Nations,
but to the United Nations
victory means a draw. And it is
for a draw that they must now
fight, with stubborn confidence
and patience. There can be no
sterner test either of statesman-
ship or of military morale.”
That the Strachey outlook has
had considerable support for
several months past in the U.S.
is perhaps not so well known as
it should be. As representative
examples in responsible papers,
“New York Times” military
writer Hanson W. Baldwin and
N. Y. “Herald Tribune” foreign-
affairs commentator Walter
Lippmann have both advocated
practically that line of policy.
In Baldwin’s view, “political
negotiations, on the basis of the
38th Parallel,” should be wel-
comed. Lippmann commented:
“It is sad but true that no
good solution is now possible in
[Corea. The high objectives
which the General Assembly
proclaimed in the resolution of
October 7—namely, ‘the estab-
lishment of a unified, inde-
pendent and democratic Gov-
ernment of Korea’ —are not now
attainable. The best that can be
had now is an armistice at the
old frontier of South and North
Korea, at the 38th Parallel. It
is also the least that the United
Nations can accept. An armistice
in the middle of Korea would
amount to a recognition by both
sides that Korea cannot be
unified in a limited war—in a
limited war both sides will have
to be content with limited
objectives.”
Editorially, the “New York
Times” has pointed out some of
the possibly generally over-
looked advantages of the Korea
fighting:
“It has upset the Communist
timetable of conquest. It has
provided relief for other areas
under Communist pressure—
areas including not only Indo-
China and Malaya hut also
Europe. And it has provided a
proving-jground for Western
men and arms which has
already led to a complete re-
organisation and reorientation
of Western strategy and tactics.”
Regarding as probable that
the fighting, with the U.N.O.
side restricted to waging defen-
sive war, might well end in
military stalemate, the “New
York Times” advocated a taking
of the initiative by U.N.O. and
Western statesmen “in seeking a
political solution.” If this proved
unattainable, then there should
be “a new and unequivocal de-
claration of purposes, so that the
fighting forces at the front and
the natiqns supporting them will
know what they are fighting
for.”
The Persian Contract.
Lord Simon, who was
British Foreign Secretary at the
time the now-disputed agree-
ment with Persia was negotiated,
has explained in a London
“Times” letter what is the real
ground of complaint against the
Persian Government.
The point involved. Lord
Simon explains, is not the right
of a sovereign Power by its
legislation to nationalise com-
mercial enterprises carried on
within its borders, nor what is
the measure of compensation it
ought to pay for so doing; the
essential point is the wrong
done if a sovereign State breaks
a contract which it has deliber-
ately made, for good considera-
tion, not to exercise such a
power.
Late in 1932, he adds, the
Persian Government suddenly
announced the cancellation of
the oil concession under which
the Anglo-Persian Oil Company
was then operating. The
British Government acted
vigorously by taking the matter
to Geneva in order that it might
be dealt with, under Article 15
of the Covenant, by the Council
of the League of Nations itself.
There was a hearing by the
members of the Council sitting
round the table in the League
of Nations building.
The dispute was amicably
settled by the Agreement of
1933, which attached new terms
to a concession lasting for 60
years ahead. It was signed on
April 29 of that year, and there
can be no question that it was
freely entered into by the
Imperial Government of Persia.
Persia obtained by it additional
advantages of great value, for
not only was the rate of royalty
increased for the future but the
increased rate was paid in re-
spect of the years 1931 and
1932, instead of the lower rate

BALANCE OF POWER.
previously stipulated. Further,
Persia received a lump sum of
£1 million sterling.
The all-important article of
the new agreement. Lord Simon
emphasises, however, is Article
21, which provides: “This Con-
cession shall not be annulled by
the Government and the terms
therein contained shall not be
altered either by general or
special legislation in the future,
or by administrative measures
or any other acts whatever of
the executive authorities.” Yet,
he adds, this is precisely what
the Government of Persia is
now claiming to do.
“Iff in these anarchic times,”
Lord Simon comments, “inter-
national law stands for anything
at all, the action now being
taken by the Persian Govern-
ment is not only a palpable
breach of Article 21 but is a
plain violation of international
law itself.”
Unchanged Japan.
As observed at first hand by
a London “News Chronicle”
correspondent, the “biggest
failure” of the Occupation in
Japan has been in the attempt
to stamp out the old feudal spirit,
which remains strong—'the
stronger, some experts claim, be-
cause of the efforts to destroy it.
“Democracy was a new lesson
to the Japanese and not an easy
one to teach anywhere. Par-
ticularly strong efforts were made
to de-deify the person of the
Emperor. Hirohito co-operated,
it is true, and showed every sign
of wishing to become a con-
stitutional monarch like our own
king. But he remains nonethe-
less to a majority of Japanese
more than a king.”
Korean Casualties.
They’re mounting up—almost
incredibly.
In London “Times’s” latest
listing, they begin to take on
world-war proportions.
“As a result of its efforts to
halt aggression in Korea”
editorially comments the
“Times ” “the United States has
been dragged into a greater war
than was ever expected and
greater, perhaps, than is even
now realised by its allies.
“In 10 months’ savage fight-
ing nearly a million men have
been killed in battle and
American casualties alone have
passed 65,000. The civilian
casualties cannot be counted,
but General MacArthur said
that he had never seen such
devastation and that he had
been sickened by the slaughter
and destruction.
“What is more, there is at pre-
sent no end of the war in sight.”

Wool Rush.
F rom beine in a huee-surnlns
t t | g P ,
has became ScTT the degree
that the Joint Organisation for
the orderlv dknn-sn of war
time Dominion wool surplus
is currently offerim? the last
100,000 bales of an accumu-
lation which at the end of the
1939-45 war approached
10,500,000 bales
“The world,”’ comments the
“Times Review of Industry,”
“has absorbed that surplus at an
average rate of two mifiion bales
a year, in addition to the clips
of the five seasons since the war,
and world demand is still esti-
mated to be running at a rate at
least 10 per cent, in excess of
current production.
“That official estimate was
reached before the United States’
special demand for wool for
military uniforms and similar
purposes reached its present pro-
portions, and the probabilities
are that any revised estimate now
would place world consumption
of wool even further ahead of
the current rate of output.”
Joe.
Quoted in “Manchester
Guardian,” a Moscow radio an-
nouncer says a few words on
the Soviet Fuhrer as the
workers go past in a Moscow
parade;—
“There is never and never
was a man in the world of so
varied, so rich, so fruitful, and
so omnipresent a genius. He
penetrates into the subtleties of
any profession, into the most
important problems of science.
“He astounds by his wisdom,
by the irreproachable correct-
ness of his advice to masters of
whatever trade they may be.
The greatest scientist or young
worker, collective farmer,
writer, architect, or diplomat -
they all speak with equal ad-
miration of the wise and com-
radely advice proffered by
Josif Vissarionovich Stalin. He
can always provide the most
correct solution of a difficult
problem.
“There is no other man in the
world who can see into the
future as clearly as Stalin does.
His forecasts are without error.”
If that doesn’t produce a
howl from Hitler he’s dead all
right!

to the Communist Government
in China we, too, have made
serious mistakes in Asia. Some
may even have induced the
Korean war. The two of us to-
gether have made a botch of a
nasty and extremely dangerous
situation.”
Colonel of the
“Chicago Tribune ” (forecasting
Republican nomination of Mac-
Arthur for Presidential election):
“In that event it is to be hoped
that Senator Taft will take the
nomination for Vice-President,
both to overcome any criticism
on MacArthur’s age and so as
to assure of this great statesman
for President if MacArthur
should not last it out and also
because it will guarantee Taft
the nomination for President in
1956. MacArthur and Taft will
certainly be the greatest ticket
that will be nominated in my
lifetime.”
U.S. Secretary of State Ache-
son ; “The increased shrillness
of the Soviet representative in
the Paris talks, Mr. Gromyko,
is in a sense a measure of the
progress of our defensive effort.
If we were not getting anywhere
with the European defence pro-
gramme the Soviet representa-
tives would not be making a
great noise about it.”
Professor Harrison Brown, of
Chicago, quoted by William L.
Laurence in his book “The Hell
Bomb”: “Such bombs could be
set on a north-south line in the
Pacific approximately a
thousand miles west of Cali-
fornia and the radioactive dust
would reach California in about
a day, and New York in five or
six days, killing most life as it
traverses the continent. And
similarly the Western Powers
could explode H-bombs on a
line the longitude of Prague
which would destroy all life
within a strip 1500 miles wide
from Leningrad to Odessa, and
3000 miles deep from Prague to
the Ural mountains.”

Britain's Festival. Assessed by
London “Daily Telegraph’ : No
free nation has more occasion than
we [British] have had in recent years
to look about us grimly. But few,
we can surely boast, have taken the
grimness so cheerfully. The Festival
is our cheerful way of reminding one
another and the world in general that
we are still on our feet, have achieved
much and are continuing our achieve-
ment.”

Festival Arts— Noted by “Man-
chester Guardian” as a feature of the
Festival of Britain, “the idea that the
arts are an essential part of our
[Britain’s] culture, not an excrescence
from it, and that they should not be
enjoyed only by a leisured class but
by all who care to share in them.
It is finding expression in “such a
wealth of music and plays and ballet
and graphic art and learned diversion
as can never have been seen in our
history. Nor is this simply a ‘show
put on for this occasion. It magnifies
what is becoming a constant part of
our society.”

U.S. Unity. —Milwaukee “Journal”
counters the impression that the U.S.
is hopelessly split on foreign policy:
“Our [America’s] worried allies should
know that on the great issues of the
day, the area of agreement among us
is vastly greater than the area of tem-
porary dispute over conduct of the
war or over the Truman Administra-
tion. The controversy of words may
rage furiously and with great excess
here among ourselves. But the
Kremlin would do well to heed the
homely advice that when you see a
red-headed man and his wife fighting,
it’s wise to keep your nose in your
own business.”

German Army Postponed. New
York “Herald Tribune” editorial
summing-up: “The truth is that there
is no immediate prospect of the
creation of a German military force.
And the fault is Germany’s. Some
Germans, who have had enough of
war, do not want to rearm. Some
Germans, frightened of Russia, want
to rearm hut only behind a greatly-
strengthened shield of Allied military
might. Some Germans are willing to
rearm, but, realising the strong bar-
gaining position they possess, demand
exorbitant pledges in return. The
most extreme want assurances that
the West will help them recover lands
lost to Poland and Russia after the
last war.”
* * * *
Revaluation. Edinburgh “Scots-
man” examines some writing on the
wall: “Events have now convinced
some sections of British opinion that
the economic difficulties inseparable
from rearmament would be greatly
eased if the exchange value of the
pound were raised. This year the
sterling area’s gold and dollar hold-
ings, of which Britain is the custodian,
have shown a further big expansion,
but the terms of trade have moved
against us, the average cost of im-
ports having continued to rise more
rapidly than that of exports, and,
largely as a result of this movement,
our trade deficit has risen ominously.
It is to deal with this situation that
revaluation is proposed.”
# * * *
World Political Milestone.—Sum-
ming-up on the Economic Co-opera-
tion Administration .by its former
head, Paul G. Hoffman: “I believe
that the supreme political significance
of the E.C.A. is that it has developed
techniques of collaboration under
which a powerful nation like the
United States can establish an effec-
tive working partnership with a less-
powerful nation without exacting
from the latter any surrender of the
right to rule itself. The E.C.A. is,
therefore, the first major experiment
in the history of world politics where a
strong Power, while participating in
the internal affairs of a weaker one,
has not only refused to infringe upon
freedom of choice but rather invoked
every means to conserve that free-
dom.”
* * * *
Bear and Dragon. —Former British
Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert
Craigie, countering in a London
“Times” letter suggestions that sanc-
tions “would only drive China further
into the arms of the U.S.S.R.”:
“While it is unwise to be dogmatic,
I believe exactly the opposite to be
the case. The Chinaman is nothing
if not astute, and Mao Tse-tung,
even if one eye is slightly blinded by
dogma, must see clearly enough that
for the satellite the Soviet Union is
a bed of nettles. It is one thing to
make use of one’s friends, but quite
another to find oneself in the hug
of the Russian bear. Complete and
utter dependence on the Soviet Union
is the last thing Communist China
will want.”
* * * *
Art Loot. —Emulating the German
example in this as in concentration
camps, genocide and other totalitarian
pleasantries, the Russians evidently
made off with untold quantities of
art treasure, a “Manchester Guardian”
correspondent noting, for example,
that the people of Dresden lost,
apparently for good, every painting
of note they possessed. In 1945 a
Soviet Art Commission spent several
weeks requisitioning about two thou-
sand of the best pictures in the
Dresden City Art Galleries. “These
are the pictures which are now
thought to be on show in Leningrad.
The collection includes, or should
include, four Correggios and several
works by Cranach, Titian, Rem-
brandt, Holbein, Paolo Veronese, and
Rubens, as well as Raphael’s Sistine
Madonna. Durer’s ‘Dresden Altar
Piece’ should also be there, and so
should two Watteaus and a picture of
the Holy Family by Mantegna. If
they are not, then they might be
almost anywhere between here and
Vladivostok.”
* * * *
Champions of the Charier. —That
Americans take U.N.O. and its
Charter most seriously has already
been contended in quoted comment
here. Sir Alfred Zimmern, in Lon-
don “Spectator,” makes a comparison
with England: “So many people in
England seem either to have forgotten
that we signed the Charter or to think
that it was a mere empty gesture. For
Americans the Charter is a constitu-
tional document which is coming to
take rank with their own Constitution.
How can they not be uneasy when
they find that their friends are pre-
pared to play fast and loose with it?”
* * * *
Nuremberg Reactions. London
“Daily Telegraph” reports disappoint-
ing German reactions to the Nurem-
berg trials, a result largely of “the
Germans’ understandable feeling, par-
ticularly in the light of post-war
developments, that they were not the
only people who should have been in
the dock.” The general result; “If
potential aggressors of the future
deduce anything from Nuremberg, it
may well be that victory must be
obtained at any cost.”
* * * *
Remobilised America. —“New York
Times” editorial summing-up: “At the
time of the outbreak of Korean
aggression last June the announced
strength of the three U.S. services.
Army, Navy and Marine Corps, was
1,458,500; today U.S. armed forces
have attained a total strength in
excess of 2,900,000. Therefore, with-
out emergency mobilisation it has
been possible to double the number
of U.S. men under arms in a period
of just nine months. Thus some of
the damage of the too-quick post-
war demobilisation has been undone.
We are getting back towards the
‘position of strength’ from which, it
is quite apparent, we must negotiate
if we are to negotiate successfully.”

was off for three days last week
with a corker bout of
bronchitis! ”
“You have a lot to growl at,”
piped up the little Mantel
Model. “How would you like
to be dragged around from room
to room by the dame who owns

serial after another while she
sweeps the kitchen crumbs into

“Well, I’ve had a few surprises

was even a woman competitor
in a quiz session who didn’t
giggle in the preliminary hooey.
I’ve had quite a day.”
“Well, I’ll be leaving you

the aristocratic Streamlined

I’m all for scientific chaps
Who frown on solid exercise
And think that after-dinner naps
Are necessary for the wise.
Why should a man sweat off the
pounds
By hiking over mountain trails
Or trudge the miles of golfing
rounds
When youthful vigor wanes and
fails ?
And why should husbands mow
their lawns
Allegedly to keep in trim
But really moved like chess-
board pawns
To suit a wife’s complacent
whims ?
Such exercises strike dismay
In manly hearts when youth is
spent.
But let us keep, once in a way.
The sort where elbow-joints are
bent!

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Whilst not forgetting to raise a
figurative hat to those hardy souls
who can back an Ajax at 40-to-l-on,
or even, as they do, send something
out at odds-on in a field of 20 or so
maiden performers, one must really
hand the palm for sheer courage in
the punting line to Melbourne cross-
country enthusiasts. To lay the
bookies the odds about any race
seems fraught with danger; to do so
concerning a steeplechase run on a
track so heavy that they are taking as
much as I.2<H for six furlongs seems
about the height of punting lunacy.
But in just such circumstances Niblik
was sent out at 10-to-9-on for the
Melrose Steeple at Moonee Valley on
Saturday, and what is more, he landed
the money with lengths to spare.
With his most recent previous form
a win and five seconds from six
starts, including thrice second to the
outstanding Benarca, Niblik was a
ready-made favorite, and his effort-
less win emphasised his stiff luck in
happening to be in form at a time
when there is a Benarca on the scene.
Niblik led pretty well all the way,
and had three lengths to spare at the
finish from Faunus, whose turn it
should shortly be.
Connections of Niblik have not
allowed themselves to relapse into the
pipe-dreams which frequently afflict
owners when there is a big race in
the offing and they’ve just won a small
one. The Niblik people confess that
they don’t really think their fellow
a Grand National proposition. As
he was beaten easily when enjoying
an advantage in the weights of 231 b.
at their last encounter, it would cer-
tainly seem a waste of time for Nib-
lik to again try conclusions with
Benarca.
While the business of showing such
high disdain for the fearful state of
the track proved a successful gamble
in the case of Niblik, punters virtually
asked to be, and duly were, put
thoroughly through the mill on all
other events. Despite topweight of
9.2 (next in the weights 8.9) the Nep-
tune colt Clutha started a solid 2-to-l
favorite for the principal event, the
12-furlongs Empire Handicap, only
to succumb by a head to the Helios
colt Regent King, who gave W. Wil-
liamson his first winner on resuming
from a spell of the judiciary’s dis-
pleasure.
As if that lesson were not enough,
Regal Scout was later sent out 9-to-4
favorite for the last race, the Kiata
Handicap (6f.). By that time the
erstwhile quagmire had been churned
into something, if possible, worse; and
Regal Scout had 10.1 with the next
in the weights 8.4 and the remainder
carrying less than Bst. Regal Scout
is a pretty good-’un but not quite
that good. He wallowed in the rear
while Tartan Crest gave jockey J.
Purtell a winner at the unusually good
odds of 12 to 1. As well, Tartan
Crest, coming on top of Purtell s
earlier winner, Rodleigh, who won
the first Laluma Handicap for two-
year-olds, gave Purtell his 60 winners
for the season, thereby breaking his
own Melbourne record of 59 out-
right winners last season. With some
weeks to go to the end of the season,
Purtell looks well set for his fourth
successive premiership, and his final
score should be something likely to
stand for many a year.
While Purtell was getting in his
good work, a record of another sort
was very nearly set up among the
four-footed fraternity when the former
Sydney galloper Grand Monarch was
saddled up twice in the afternoon and
went within an ace of landing the
double. Adhering to their odd pre-
dilection for topweights on the heavy
track, punters were all for Prediction,
lumping 9.2, in the Argyle High-
weight, but the good thing proved un-
willing, and Grand Monarch, who, it
is true, carried only a couple of
pounds less than the topweight,
showed great gameness in winning
by a head from Raysun, who carried
8.5. Penalised for this win, Grand
Monarch then went out himself top-
weight with 8.4 for the 10-furlongs
Deep Creek Handicap, and another
rattling close finish saw the Talking
gelding this time go under by a half-
head; still, it was a splendid effort.
Winner of the Deep Creek was the
Enfield four-year-old Golden Field.
* * * *
The racing at Canterbury on
Saturday was full of surprises, but
the punter who was content merely
to follow the money without perplex-
ing himself by too-closely questioning
the form-credentials of the horses in
demand on the whole fared rather
well. While some of the well-backed
winners were obvious popular choices,
others seemed to have very tenuous
claims to consideration, and in two
instances connections reportedly dis-
claimed all knowledge of the hefty
plunges on their nags. While they
don’t always come off, these betting
plunges, which, if we are to believe
connections, come as a complete sur-
prise to the stable, seem pretty fre-
quent occurrences, and they’re most
certainly not a healthy sign.
One winner which did evidently
sneak under everyone’s guard was
the elderly and poorly-performed Sir
Raven. Since the only previous fruits
of his several seasons’ racing had
been successes in a 10-furlongs three-
year-old handicap (in 1947) and a
nine-furlongs welter, Sir Raven was
understandably completely neglected
in betting on the six-furlongs Flying
Handicap; particularly since the other
16 runners were, without exception,
winners over sprint distances. Heroic
Sovereign was a warm favorite for the
Flying, and at least half the field were
accorded a fair measure of support.
Sir Raven and an older but little-
better-performed opponent in Open-
ing, both of whom started at 25 to 1,
were near the tail of the field until
after they’d turned for home. In the
straight both made their run together,
and, finishing brilliantly (by compari-
son with the others), they hit the line
wth Sir Raven a long neck to the
good. The New Zealand-bred three-
year-old Aden also made up fair
ground in the straight to finish third,
barely a nose behind the others.
Although he has been a good friend
to punters in other days, Heroic
Sovereign has, of more recent times,
become a very expensive proposition
to follow. From his last 10 starts he
has five times started favorite without
once landing the bacon. Yet he is
one of those customers who never
seem to run a sufficiently really bad
race to justify dropping them alto-
gether. The same 10 runs have seen
him notch up two seconds and four
thirds and twice finish fourth.
A few weeks back apprentice V.
Haddrick had never ridden a winner
and the six-year-old gelding Le Petit
Due hadn’t won a race since stealing
a Mixed Stakes at Moorefield in
March, 1949. Now, with each other’s
assistance, Haddrick has ridden three
winners and Le Petit Due has notched
up three wins in a row. Le Petit Due
completed his hat trick when he led
all the way (as he has done in his
previous wins) to take Saturday’s May
Handicap of 12 furlongs and 98yd.
Registering his first win in open com-
pany, Le Petit Due hung on surpris-
ingly stoutly to beat Revenue by a
nose. It was, incidentally, a trifle
melancholy to see a horse of Hurry
Up’s once-considerable calibre last all
the way in the May Handicap: for,
with due respect to the performance
of the undoubtedly much-improved
winner, Saturday’s field was about as
poor as one could imagine contesting
an open-company, middle-distance
handicap. Hurry Lip may confound
this critic by doing something to
justify his continued racing, but on
Saturday’s showing the Queensland
Cup and A.J.C. Plate winner should
be allowed to rest on his past laurels.
Two winners concerning the heavy
backing of which connections pro-
fessed themselves ignorant were the
two-year-old filly Fancy Free and the
six-year-old Hall Mark gelding Peace
Treaty. Fancy Free (R. Binder) had
had only one previous outing, finish-
ing unplaced in a Maiden Juvenile at
Newcastle, but she was backed from
25 to 1 down to sixes for Saturday’s
Two-year-old Handicap. After seem-
ing hopelessly out of matters early,
Fancy Free came home with a rattling
run on the rails to win most impres-
sively. In the nine-furlongs Welter,
although several others started at con-
siderably shorter odds, there was a
pile of support for Peace Treaty, who
eventually went out at sevens and
won comfortably at the expense of
“ Yours is my second case of valvular trouble this morning .”
Regal Speed and the favorite Perfect
Chatter.
Possibly the best of other winners
was the Midstream-Tittle Tattle colt
Bankbrook. Bankbrook was one of
the top-priced lots of his year at
the Sydney sales, but a leg injury up-
set his early preparation. However,
although he had had only one previ-
ous outings, and that an unplaced run
in a juvenile 12 months previously,
Bankbrook went out a 2-to-l favorite
for the second Three- and Four-year-
old, and won it with consummate ease.

“Pass-it”: University suffered its
first defeat of the season in Sydney
Rugby Union on Saturday when it
went down to St. George 14-39. With-
out seeking to detract from the merit
of St. George’s win, the scores do
indicate that University was only a
shadow of the team that so convinc-
ingly maintained an unbeaten record
over the first five rounds; obviously
their players were feeling the effects
of the strenuous programme of inter-
Varsity football in which they had
taken part during the previous week.
Nevertheless, St. George did show a
way to beat the students: namely, by
the half-back and five-eighth running
with the ball and turning it back to
their forwards. St. George exploited
this move so successfully that even had
Varsity been at their best they may
have been hard-pressed to avoid
defeat.
Randwick and Gordon both suf-
fered setbacks to their premiership
hopes when they were convincingly
beaten by Manly and Easts respec-
tively. Norths were not impressive in
their 26-8 win over Drummoyne: the
scores flattered Drummoyne, whose
players are very young and inexperi-
enced. Late in the second half, with
the Drummoyne defences reduced to a
rabble, Norths lost many opportuni-
ties through lack of understanding and
failure to finish off moves. Such lapses
mean defeat in a closely-fought
match where opportunities are rare,
and, when they come, should be
pounced upon and driven home in no
uncertain manner. In Saturday’s
other match Parramatta beat Wests;
Eastwood had the bye.
Officials of the Rugby codes must
be noting with some uneasiness the
thumping crowds which are being
drawn by the English Soccer tourists.
It is particularly remarkable when one
considers that it is generally accepted
that the matches are principally of
academic interest —the tourists are
far too hot for the locals to offer
much prospect of real competitive in-
terest. Soccer is very firmly implanted
in the coal and steel areas and also
in the more industrial areas of Syd-
ney; and enthusiasm for the round-
pill game is growing fast. The first
Soccer Test, played at Sydney Cricket
Ground on Saturday, attracted some
46,000 fans, who saw the English
team give a pleasing exhibition of
how the game should be played; an
Australian team assisted the demon-
stration by occupying the remainder
of the field. The final score was 4-1
England’s way, and the general im-
pression was that it could as easily
have been 14-1.

The French Rugby League tourists
on Saturday defeated a Newcastle
team 12-8. Whereupon first shots
were promptly fired in the traditional
referee-wrangle which seems to be an
indispensible feature of any Rugby
.League tour of these parts.

The V.F.L. competition was sus-
pended on Saturday while Victoria
and South Australia staged their
annual contest at M.C.G. When J.
Pluvius announced his preference for
Victoria by soaking the ground (the
Croweaters seldom play in mud) only
about 33,000 turned out. They saw
a slugging, slithering game in which,
somewhat to Victoria’s astonish-
ment, the locals could win by only
10.11 to 9.9.
* * * *
Deprived of their customary amuse-
ment and accepted privilege of
vociferously disagreeing with the ref.,
regular Leichhardt Stadium fans last
week must have rankled under a
strong sense of injustice. Scheduled
for 12 rounds, the Charlie Dunn (9.6)
v. Ken Wenman (9.7) main event
lasted not a great many more seconds.
Reputedly one of the cleverest boxers
in action, Wenman started in slovenly
fashion and slipped to his hands and
knees soon after they came up for
action. He bounded up before the
count commenced, but only to run
straight into one right which rendered
him three-parts unconscious and
another which completed the job; a
very leisurely-counted 10 seconds saw
the end of the round still far off and
Wenman out to the world ’neath the
ropes. Nor did fans have oppor-
tunity to voice an opinion on the
10-round chief support bout; it went
little more than two rounds, with
Tony Assan (10.5£) outing Billy
Palmer (10.7) early in the third.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Sheep on Sandy Country.
“Bass”: A sheepman from
the Murchison (W.A.) is plan-
ning to stock a 14,000-acre
stretch of coastal plain, 25 miles
from Perth, This country is
practically pure sand, with an
occasional swamp, timbered with
banksia, wattle, some jarrah,
redgum and white-gum and a
profusion of small scrub, includ-
ing blackboy. It’s not rich
country, but it has one redeem-
ing feature—an unlimited under-
ground water-supply at com-
paratively shallow depth and a
heavy winter rainfall.
Hitherto used only as
“change” country, sheep could
be left for a few months only,
or they developed “coastal
disease,” caused by absence of
copper and cobalt. This has
been overcome by feeding these
elements in water and licks.
If the experiment is successful
a large area of sheep country
“Keep a straight course, Dad, or the furrers'll be crooked .”
will be opened up close to the
Perth markets. The coastal plains
north of Perth are largely unde-
veloped, and have not been
highly thought of. Yet around
the swamps, in ground that is
not greatly different from the
surrounding areas, profitable
gardens have been established.
At present, with drinking-
water provided, in its natural
state it may run a sheep to three
acres. Properly treated it could
be much more heavily stocked.
W.A. is experimenting very
successfully with its light lands
from Geraldton to Esperance.
Super.
“Hortus”: Super, is not an
easy manure to handle. Formed
from ground rock phosphate—a
tri-calcic phosphate treated
with nearly its own weight of
dilute sulphuric acid, it becomes
a mono-calcic substance. What
has happened? The acid has
taken away a certain percentage
of the lime, making a water-
soluble super., as we know it.
This is, of course, immediately
available to crops. So we use it
in all cases where a rapid return
is desired.
Some growers think that the
super, sown with seed is washed
out of the soil after heavy rain.
Not so. The solution comes in
contact with particles of lime and
a new di-calcic phosphate
appears. This is not water-
soluble. However, by means of
acid juices secreted in roots and
root-hairs, plants can avail them-
selves of the phosphoric acid but,
of course, less quickly. In
course of time more lime from
the soil is absorbed and the once
mono-calcic phos. water-soluble
has reverted to the insoluble tri-
calcic phos.
A good crop removes about
half of the fertiliser which it is
necessary to apply to it. Don’t
think, as one farmer did the
other day, that he need not put
as much super, in the ground for
the next crop on the same area.
Exactly the same quantity, or
more, is required to produce a
similar good result.
Super, is specially beneficial
on soils of medium nature and
such as contain lime. In soils
deficient in lime, super, some-
times becomes insoluble in a
worse form even than the tri-
calcic. It becomes a highly in-
soluble iron phosphate, pretty
useless for crop-growing. So if
you know land is deficient in
lime, give it some prior to sow-
ing. If you don’t, remember
that super, is an acid manure and
you can blame it and not the
seed or the soil for crop failure.
The Home Orchard.
“Sundowner”; When planning
a home fruit-garden, study the
area available, class of soil and
amount of time and expense
which can be spared for it.
Large and vigorous tree-growth
is undesirable, and can be over-
come by the use of dwarfing
root stocks, which restrict the
ultimate size of the tree. Range
of varieties of a particular fruit
may be extended by grafting or
budding several varieties on the
same tree. This could embrace
early and late varieties, thus en-
suring a supply of fruit right
through the season.
Varieties of fruits have been
developed for particular pur-
poses—culinary, dessert or dual-
purpose and long - keeping
quality. When buying trees,
therefore, specify the particular
varieties required. The follow-
ing offer a selection for planting
in higher-rainfall areas: Apples,
Gravenstein (early dessert and
culinary), Cox’s orange pippin
(early mid-season of fine flavor),
Jonathan (mid-season dessert),
Cleopatra (mid-season dual-
purpose), Golden Delicious
(good flavor and cooking quali-
ties), Granny Smith (late, dual-
purpose), Stunner (late, dual-
purpose, stores well for winter
needs). Pears, William Bon
Chretin (early, dual-purpose),
Packham’s Triumph (early, mid-
season, culinary), Buerre Bose
(mid-season, dessert). Winter
Cole (mid - season dessert),
Doyenne du Comice (mid-season
.to late, fine eating variety),
Winter Nelis (late, dessert), A
selection of peach varieties may
be had by budding Briggs’ Red
May, Anzac, Pumps, Beales and
Smith’s Seedling. Best yellows
are Valiant, Phillips and Golden
Queen. Newboy or Goldmine
nectarines may also be budded
on a peach-tree.
If room can be found for a
cherry-tree it should preferably
be on the weaker-growing stock
known as Mahaieb. In larger
gardens a range of varieties is
necessary to extend the season.
Popular varieties are Early
Rivers, Burgsdorf Seedling, Bed-
ford Prolific, St. Margaret’s,
Lambert and Florence. A recom-
mended apricot-tree is Moore-
park. A wide range of prunes
and plums is available. Try
Angelina Burdett, Greengage,
Golden Drop, Jefferson, Grand
Duke, Ponds Seedling and the
prunes Imperatrice and d’Argen.
Reliable strawberries are
Royal Sovereign and Tardive de
Leopold, and gooseberries, Crow
Bob, Yorkshire Giant and
Selection.
Selecting Breeding Fowls.
“K.T.”: Select only the best
specimens. Hens should be
good layers of large eggs and
of good breed type and general
health. Hens that have laid 200
eggs or more of good size (2oz.
or better) in their pullet year are
suitable.
Where trapnesting or single-
testing is not practised, selec-
tion is done by observation. If
a flock average is kept (it should
be) and the worst layers have
been culled before the time of
selection, then the work should
not be too difficult. Don’t breed
from hens which lay small eggs
or from small hens. Those of
medium size are the most profit-
able layers.
The cock to head the pen is
important and should be a pedi-
greed bird. Select one of good
breed type, active and vigorous
and of sound constitution. Have
him strong in the points in which
the hens he is to be mated with
are weak. For example, a hen
with a wry tail (a disqualification
in a show), which is a tail carried
higher than 90 degrees, mated
with a cockerel with very low
tail carriage, can produce
progeny with correct tail
carriage.
Mate about 12 hens with a
male in light breeds-, and six to
10 in the heavies. It should be
noted that a vigorous White Leg-
horn cock may mate with up to
20 hens, with high fertility.

“Bill C”: Provided it has a
narrow rim and straight sides,
is free from dents and has a
flat bottom, any fairly tall tin
will serve as a rain-gauge.
Shape isn’t important—it may
be round or square. If raised
2ft. or so up, water won’t splash
into it from the ground. It
should be set in an exposed posi-
tion. Measuring can be done
with a well-graduated steel rule.
I have proved that a tin will
catch the same amount of rain
as a proper gauge. Advantages
of a gauge are: (a) The rain
doesn’t splash out so easily ; ( b)
with the measure-glass provided
very small amounts of rain may
be recorded,
A Bad Weed.
“Mac Fergus”: Hexham scent
(Melilotus indica ), for a period
confined only to the southern
Darling Downs (Q.), has spread
rapidly to wheat areas in
northern and western Downs.
Boomed as a fodder at one time
under the name of King Island
melilot, it quickly became un-
popular in Queensland dairying
country owing to its peculiar
odor, which taints milk and
cream.
It is a menace in wheatfields,
the scent penetrating through the
grain, making it unfit for milling
purposes. As it reaches a height
of approximately 2ft. and ripens
about the same time as wheat,
it is a problem.
If cut when in flower it will
shoot. Cutting before the seed
ripens at the end of the flower-
ing season appears to be the only
method of control. Ploughed
under in its early stages it makes
an excellent green manure.
Drenching a Horse.
“Kooweerup”: Use a strong
halter, complete with nose-band
and throat-lash. Select a suit-
able tree-fork or overhead
beam about 7ft. or Bft. from
the ground, make a non-slip loop
about 2ft. round in a strong
rope. Lead the horse directly
beneath the strongpoint, pass
the loop under the nose band,
over the nostrils and into the
mouth. The free end goes over
the beam. Hold it by hand so
that if the horse fights you can
“play” him.
The drench should be in a
strong bottle. Some horses, once
they get a glass bottleneck
between their molars, make
short work of it. There are
special metal drenching-bottles
on the market. Likewise a
drenching-bit, a device which
loops around the nose and in-
side the mouth, the main part
consisting of a hollow tube with
small hole into which a funnel
can be fitted. Pour in only
small quantities at a time, and
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
Importance of the sunspot factor in weather has been
shown by the relief rains, which came with the great increase
in sunspot activity after a long period of falling sunspot
values and a resultant dry spell. There is another favorable
prospect. A southern sunspot now advancing has shown an
increase of energy and should give further relief rains about
this week, of benefit to the wheat crops.
The dry spell came earlier than in the previous cycle on
account of the weakening of the sunspots; as it had a certain
period in the cyclical sequence, so it may end earlier with
the same good rains as occurred 71 years ago in September
and October, but which may now come sooner. This,
however, will depend a good deal on the development of
the sunspots.

bo careful to avoid sending
fluid “down the wrong way."
If neither drenching-bit nor
metal bottle is to hand fix about
six inches of rubber hose to the
neck of the beer-bottle and put
only the hose part into the
mouth. Watch the throat move-
ments which indicate whether
swallowing is taking place, and
don’t attempt to replenish until
one mouthful is swallowed. If
the animal is a little slow, coax
it with a light slap on the cheek.
Some horses will hang back on
the rope for a while, but if given
time will take the medicine
quietly. Be quiet and patient.
The more impatient and noisier
you are, the less chance there is
of giving the drench.
Modern Dam-building.
“Ngaduri”; Recently had a
bulldozer in to put four dams
in each of four 30-acre pad-
docks. Total cost amounted to
£120; total capacity about
400,000 gallons when full. Com-
pared with the cost of bore-
sinking in country where water
is available at about 60ft. (at 255.
per foot, casing extra) and the
additional cost of four mills,
tanks, piping and troughing, the
advantage is obvious.
However, there are draw-
backs. A 10-ton tractor con-
stantly running up and down
the batter is unable to construct
a wall as watertight as did the
old bullock-scoop, where the
beasts worked up to their hocks
in mud and thoroughly puddled
the whole thing down. The
remedy is, as soon as the bot-
tom has a few inches of water
in it, to fence the dam, allowing
about a chain all round, and
turn in as many sheep as it will
hold. They’ll puddle the bot-
tom at this stage and make that
watertight. Later, after a rain,
turn them in again and —
especially if they be ewes and
lambs —they will consolidate the
whole bank. Calves or horses
allowed access as the level re-
cedes will tighten the face
exactly as did the bullocks.
Then, when the dam is
fenced plough all round inside
the fence and sow with phalaris,
or couch, or whatever does best
in your district. This will pre-
vent silting by straining run-
off water and, through the bind-
ing action of the roots on the
soil, will prevent formation of
gutters. For added luxury plant
one or two willows, ash or
Lombardy poplars on the north
bank !o keep the water cool in
summer.
I’m talking about the S.A. dis-
trict of Clare, where the rainfall
is generally good and the coun-
try kind to farmers and graziers.
The dams will have running
water in them most of the time,
and I mean to try stocking them
with fish.
It’s important to consider
what happens to the water going
out of the dam. It has to be
conducted away safely (which
means not more than a 2 p.c.
fall) and allowed to run free
well clear of the wall; the out-
let must have a greater capacity
than the inlet.
Hints for the Farm.
“Billjim”: Where marrow,
squash and pumpkins have been
allowed to remain on the vine
to gain the benefit of late autumn
sunshine they should be picked
now to avoid early severe frosts.
Those not quite ripe may be
finished off in a glasshouse or in
a sunny situation for up to 10
days, then placed in a dry, airy
place where a favorable tem-
perature can be maintained
during storage.
“C.A.A.”: In preparation for
rough winter weather mould up
early-planted cauliflowers, cab-
bages and sprouts. The ridges
thus created will support the
plants and improve soil drainage.
“Metax”: For giving a dog
a pill use about jin. or less of
cooked sausage, cut crossways.
The pill can be pushed securely
into the inside of the piece, and
the whole is usually consumed
in one swallow.
“Mac F.”: Phenomenal sorg-
hum yields prevail in the Pitts-
worth (Darling Downs) district.
One farmer has taken off over
1000 bags from 27 acres, repre-
senting about £l5OO at current
prices, and it is estimated that
some crops will harvest better
than 40 bags to the acre. Cap-
rock is a popular variety.
“W. Court”; Metallic zinc
thrown into the firebox occa-
sionally will help prevent soot
from clogging stove and flue (B.
10/1/’5l). The zinc may be
scrap stuff like the cases from
exhausted dry-cell batteries.
Common salt is a good soot-
remover.
“Sarina”: Smoke fires help
to keep mosquitoes and sand-
flies away from stock. Mess-
mate, grass-tree and similar
good smouldering trunks are
best; they smoke freely and
smell strongly. Avoid having
fires in the paddock if stock are
rugged.
“Waverly”: Foot-abscess in
sheep is often confused with
footrot, but the difference is
that the former isn’t contagious,
and appears only under favor-
able climatic conditions.
Usually it affects only one foot,
and old sheep are more
susceptible to it than lambs or
weaners. When a sheep is seen
“carrying” one leg, look for the
abscess. Make a little incision,
allow pus to drain, and dip in
10 per cent, bluestone or 5 per
cent, formalin. Most of them
recover naturally.
“Shadow-chaser”: An end
stay in a wire fence should be
as durable as the post it is de-
signed to keep erect. How often
do we see a post that will last a
lifetime inadequately supported
by a stay that will rot in a
few years? Ironbark, if avail-
able, should make the stay, with
box for second choice. All gums
will last well in the country they
grow in, but rot off at ground-
level elsewhere.

REBELLION
By METAX
IN the light of the full moon,
the hunter’s hut and the
battery of dog-kennels
around it stood out as the
one speck of civilisation in a
broad expanse of rugged forest.
The hunter took down a book
from the shelf, and in the dim
light consulted his horoscope.
The run of the stars showed only
evil ahead. An ominous atmos-
iphere seemed to surround the
place. It was all very puzzling
so early in a season so far so
prosperous.
The dogs rested uneasily, too.
First one, then another opened
,an eye to peep furtively upwards.
The stars appeared so pale and
insignificant in the bright moon-
light. There seemed to be evil
signs for the future popping up
everywhere. It was so unbeliev-
able in view of the happy
prospects the pack had schemed
to achieve so soon. If only
Sirius, the Dog Star, could be
seen, he might have had some
message of consolation to offer.
The head dog gave a low
moan. Others followed quickly.
The din grew louder. The
hunter’s voice from the hut
door, seeking to quell the dis-
turbance, went unheard. There
was a stampede on now, as the
head dog galloping back and
forth barked out his demands.
Next morning the hunter
looked sadly at the taxation
form he had signed the night
before ; and the jubilant pack
trotted gaily off to enjoy them-
selves as they pleased, for a
month, on their annual leave.
A life close to nature had
made the hunter too practical to
moan long over his misfortunes.
Concluding that money saved
from not eating was still in the
“treacle-tin” free from income-
tax, he set his alcoholic injection
syringe at thirty days, gave him-
self a stab, pulled his hat over
his eyes and settled down in a
corner of the hut where least
wind came between the slabs, to
snooze the month away.
HP HE rabbits had read their
A chances from the stars, too.
They were well prepared with
sharpened toenails, supple
muscles and a carefully com-
piled “one-moon plan.” As the
last dog-tail bobbed over the
horizon, they began.
Soon a neat barricade of
freshly-moved earth began to
grow around the silent enemy
camp. Hour by hour the work
went quietly on. The near-by
bandicoots peeped out of the
windows of their squats and
giggled.
Down in the depths of the
earth the rabbit tunnelling gangs
pushed onwards, producing a
maze of subterranean hollowness
that would have made an excava-
tion engineer scratch his head in
wonder. Day by day the work
went on with a relentless persis-
tence. The birds of the forest
came to seek food in the fresh-
smelling earth heaps. The
bandicoots giggled more,
although some of their squats
were in danger and the inmates
had to seek fresh home-sites.
But still the hunter slept peace-
fully on ; and the dogs, with un-
filled stomachs, sore feet, and
one with a bullet-hole through
his tail, continued to enjoy their
annual holidays.
Every minute that passed
made the earth beneath less able
to support the hunter and his
residence and the temporarily
vacated dog-kennels.
As the end section of the ex-
cavations drew near, arrange-
ments began for scratching out
the last supports to permit the
final collapse. Then, as the days
passed, kennel after kennel sank
through the surface to crash
deep into the earth, leaving
behind only gaping cavities
around the lonely doomed
sleeper and his hut.
ON the twenty-eighth day
preparations began for the
demolition of the last earthly
props which now stood between
the unsuspecting hunter and
eternity. The twenty-ninth day
broke dull and ominous. The
“Suicide Squad” volunteers
from rabbits with trap-injured
paws and half-healed dog-bites—
were at their posts early.
It was near dusk after a raw
day. Rain was falling steadily
through gusts of bitter wind.
Odd barks came from the dis-
tance, The first dog to return
over the earth barricade reached
the precincts of the hut just too
late to retreat before the
collapsing earth - mass carried
him to his destruction with his
still-slumbering master.
One by one the remainder of
the hungry horde reached the
edge of the cataclysm, but none
survived the slippery sides. Each
was carried to his end on a great
hunk of collapsing earth.
CASUALTIES amongst the
rabbits were few. Even the
“suicide squad” escaped. One
veteran with two-and-a-half legs
suffered a torn ear.
All of which goes to show
what organisation can achieve.
The great hole rapidly filled
with water as the downpour be-
came torrential. From a distant
vantage-point a few tired rabbit
observers watched the climax of
the joyous catastrophe. They
were the sole witnesses of the
final tragic scene. Even the
moon, hiding behind heavy,
black cloud masses, and Sirius,
the Dog Star, away on the other
side of the earth, were spared
the appalling sight.

Meaning and origin of the term
“laisser-faire” ?
The term is French “let do,” that
is, “let people and things alone.” The
principle of laisser-faire allows prob-
lems to work themselves out without
planning and regulations. It is,
specifically, the principle of non-
interference by Government in com-
mercial affairs. The phrase comes
from the motto of the mid-18th-cen-
tury physiocratic school of French
economists, Laisser-faire, laissez-
passer (let do, let pass), who wished
to have all Customs duties abolished,
demanded free circulation for their
goods, thus anticipating the later
Freetraders. Its authorship is generally
credited to Jean de Gournay (1712-
1759). Adam Smith took laisser-
faire theories to England, from where
they later spread to the United States.
As embodied in the writings of Smith,
the principle became one of the bul-
warks of capitalist economics.

What was boxer Bill Lang’s real
name? Where and when was Lang
born? From whom did he win the
Australian heavyweight championship,
and who beat him for that title?
Bill Lang’s real name was William
Langfranchi, and he was born in
Melbourne, Victoria, on July 8, 1883.
He began boxing in 1905, and won the
Australian heavyweight championship
by outpointing Bill Squires (20
rounds) at Sydney Stadium on
February 3, 1909. Tommy Burns won
the title from Lang, but Bums, Jack
Lester, Sam McVea and Sam Lang-
ford (subsequent champions) then re-
turned to U.S.A., and Dave Smith
became Australian heavyweight cham-
pion by outpointing Lang (20 rounds)
at Melbourne Stadium on November
4, 1913.

Some information about a Dutch
island in Europe called Texel?
Texel is one of the Dutch West
Frisian Islands, covering 71 square
miles, separated from the mainland by
the two-mile-broad Marsdiep and
opposite the town of Den Helder. At
one time it was joined to the island
of Vlieland and the foreshore beyond.
The north part of the island is called
Eierland, or Egg Land, from the bird
observatory erected in this part of the
island, where thousands of birds be-
longing to more than a hundred
species breed every year. Of late
years the island has been much fre-
quented by tourists and by holiday-
makers as a camping centre. In 1945
it was liberated by the Russian
prisoners-of-war who had been
quartered there. The whole island
forms one municipality; the inhabi-
tants live by sheep-breeding, land
agriculture and fishing. There are
considerable exports of Iambs to
England. Texel ewe-cheese is famous
as a Dutch export. The farmhouses
°i? .have a peculiarly square
shape, with tall pyramidal roofs
(stolpen ). It was off Texel in 1653
that an English fleet under Monck
beat a Dutch fleet under Tromp, who
was killed during the battle.
♦ * * *
Correct use and meaning of ‘'proto-
type” ?
The derivation of the word is im-
portant—it comes from the Greek
protos, first, and typos, model.
Therefore it means the original or
model from which anything is copied,
a primary form or pattern. There
could be “the prototype of a species”
or “the prototype of the novel.”
“Prototype” must refer to the first
of any particular series or progres-
sions; usually, however, it is used
quite wrongly. It is quite common
to come across such a phrase as “the
modem liner, the prototype of the
paddle-wheeler of last century,” which
is nonsense. It would be possible
(and quite gramatically correct) to
say thm the paddle-wheeler was the
prototype of the modern liner; the
general correctness of the statement
depends on whether the paddle-
steamer really is lhe first of the stages
which led up to today’s liner. But
it’s absurd to say that a later develop-
ment is the model from which earlier
forms arose-

Woolgrowers
Wooigrowers were not surprised at the
flood of criticism loosed on them by
the city Press after wool rose so spec-
tacularly in value. But I was a little
shaken by the attitude of The Bulletin
in this “witch-hunt.”
Does The Bulletin really believe, as
suggested in the last two editions, that
woolgrowers, as such, voted against the
Liberal-Country party candidates? Study
closely the trend in the three electorates
surrounding me, Farrer, Riverina and
Hume. The Government candidates in
the first two would have been hard pressed
in the big towns, but the rural vote put
their election beyond doubt. Similarly
in Hume, Anderson, V.C., hopelessly
behind on the early count from the big
towns, put up a fighting finish as the
rural vote took effect. Obviously the
rural vote would contain a generous pro-
portion of w'oolmen, and the statement
that he was beaten by the votes of “a surly
section of woolgrowers” is only a bad
guess.
Woolgrowers are reasonably intelligent.
They knew that the Labor Opposition
was as much responsible for the Wool
Sales Deduction Act as the Government.
How else could it have become law?
They knew an incoming Government
would be incapable of refunding the tax
because it has been spent already (to curb
inflation)! Would they be likely to take
the bait?
It is fashionable at the moment to
malign the woolgrower as some sort of
parasite responsible for most of the ills
besetting us. Contrary to general belief,
the industry has never sought, nor has it
received. Government aid. All it asks now
is to be allowed to continue to control its
own destiny and to sell in a free market.
I don’t want to discuss the Wool Sales
Deduction Act except to say it is sectional,
and, therefore, unjust. When the law
governing provisional tax was framed
fluctuating incomes were brought into
consideration. From a tax-collection
viewpoint the recent legislation was un-
necessary except to secure funds immedi-
ately to bridge the huge Budget gap, and
the woolgrower looked a good mark.
What will happen when the pendulum
swings? It will be incumbent upon the
Government then to see that the wool-
grower is not compelled to pay a grossly
inflated provisional tax, when, at the time
his assessment is issued, his income for
the then current year is known to have
been, perhaps, decimated. —C. O.
(N.S.W.).
Municipalities and Roads
It’s about time Victorian municipalities
dumped road-making (B. 9/5/’5l) for all
time and concentrated on giving better
service to their ratepayers than the present
poor return for high rates.
For some reason, known only to the
framers of the Local Government Act,
Victorian municipalities are compelled to
build roads which are used mainly by
motorists from other municipalities.
Take, for instance, a small country town
on the main Sydney highway. It builds
that part of the highway through the
township, yet the bulk of the traffic,
including many heavy semi-trailers, which
uses it is from outside.
Victoria’s Government would be acting
wisely if it vested all the State’s roads in
the efficient, Government-controlled
Country Roads Board. If this body were
given full power to make roads, it would
be only right to instruct municipalities to
cut down the excessive rating, for which
little return is given.
I pay the local council about £l2 a
year and all I receive in return is that
my rubbish is cleared twice weekly—only
once if a public holiday occurs in the
week. On the other hand, for the £l2
I pay the Melbourne and Metropolitan
Board of Works I receive a first-class
sewerage system and a first-class water-
supply—a striking comparison.
Drastic reforms of operation and con-
duct of Victorian municipalities are
needed to stop this “slugging” of rate-
payers. For years councils have used
the excuse of heavy costs of roadmaking
(yet few, if any, roads are made), while
they have given little, or no, service to
ratepayers.
While agreeing with “N.A.” (B.
9/5/’5ll on the high costs of roadmaking,
I think a general streamlining of admini-
stration by councils is first necessary, to
reduce costs and ensure ratepayers some-
thing in return for their money.—W. D, L.
(Vic.).
Nurses
The N. S. Wales Government, after
toying with the idea for some time, has
decided to amend the Nurses’ Registra-
tion Act to reduce the age at which nurses
can begin training from 18 to 17 years.
This action will be of little help in over-
coming the present shortage of trained
nurses. Matron Shaw, of Crown-street
—and she should know—says that 17 is
too young for girls to start nursing. She
backs up her argument by remarking that
the system of cadet nursing lately intro-
duced at certain hospitals for girls under
18 has been a failure. It has been found
that the girls get sick of the work and
leave before completing the course.
Young girls of 17, most of them fresh
from the schoolroom, are certainly too
young and lacking in experience to cope
with the exacting work and responsi-
bilities of nursing. Apart from the jolt
they themselves receive, there is also the
patients’ point of view to be considered.
When youth comes face to face with
intense suffering, strict discipline and hard
work, the result is too often a rapid
“toughening-up” process. Natural sym-
pathy is checked, work is strictly just
work, and patients are merely a weari-
some duty. No good nurse can have an
attitude like that. While she must be im-
personal to a certain degree for the sake
of all concerned, she must retain her
sympathy for the sick and suffering, and
“respect the art that heals and saves.”
The nursing profession would probably
benefit more by the raising of the entrance
age than by its lowering. Then it would
be more likely to attract women who
really know that they want to be nurses,
though experienced enough to realise
something of what the job entails. — Mac
(N.S.W.).
A.B.C. News Service
M. F. Dixon’s instances of “scoops”
by the A.B.C. news-service (B. 16/5/ 51)
are far outnumbered by the regular
“scooping” of the service by
the dailies. The A.B.C.’s
inexperienced and over-
worked staff cannot be ex-
pected to get on to the big
“scoops” when it is flat-out
rehashing handouts and
making routine calls for
news. Granted the A.B.C. is
able to break news several
hours ahead of the papers,
but that is only routine news
which is there for the asking.
The big news that boosts
newspaper circulation never
comes the way of the A.8.C.,
which, unknown to thousands
of its listeners, relies on the
dailies for .much of the news
in its breakfast sessions. For
years it has been the practice
in Melbourne, Sydney and
Brisbane to bring on staff as
early as 5 a.m. to peruse the
dailies for stories not already
in the bulletins.
That alone is one reason why the
morning bulletins are so full, complete
and up to the minute. Frequently a
contact who has tipped me off on a first-
class “scoop” the night before has been
amazed to hear it broadcast at 7.45 a.m.
when he has riot been contacted for con-
firmation.
For years the A.B.C, news-service has
been proud of its Prince of Wales and
Repulse scoop (which, incidentally, was
picked up from the 8.8. C., and, strangely
enough, denied by the then Prime
Minister, Mr. Curtin, eight hours later)
and General Bennett’s escape from
Singapore. But surely those are out-
weighed by such scoops of the dailies
as:
Mr. McKell’s impending appointment
as Governor-General before the recom-
mendation had been sent to the King;
R.A.A.F. Lincoln smash 30 miles from
Brisbane a few years ago when a com-
mercial radio-service broadcast the news
at 7 p.m. and the A-B.C. did not announce
it till 9 p.m.;
Melbourne’s last tram-fare fise and the
appointment of its latest chairman (Brig.
R. J. H. Risson).
It would be unfair to blame the
A.B.C. for missing those “scoops” which
are gained by experienced newspaper-
men with “leaks” planted everywhere.
Until the A.B.C. can build up a staff of
experienced newspapermen it cannot
hope to compete with the dailies on the
big stuff yet. In the meantime it is doing
a fine job in a general all-round service.
Mr. Menzies was quite critical of the
A-B.C. for its election broadcast on elec-
tion night done by the news-service de-
partment. He told his supporters early
on the Sunday that the A.B.C. had given
an incomplete broadcast which to him
made it almost impossible to follow the
trend of voting returns.— Waddlin’
Willie (Vic.).
“Compensation for Resumption”
Although the point of private-owner
hardship may be raised, any Australian
State is within its right in resuming land
required for a public purpose without
paying anything for what has come to
be called “unearned increment”—the
community value given to land (B.
2/5/’5l).
In the new Land Regulations dated
March 5, 1831, promulgated by the
Court of St. James, and reaching
Governor Stirling of W.A. in December
of that same year, the Crown makes it
clear that the sovereign ownership of
land within Australia was not hereafter
given to private persons. The right of
resumption by the Crown for any public
purpose was explicitly stated. Since the
Crown thus reserved final ownership it
is under no obligation to pay for any-
thing other than improvements when
claiming resumption.
A further clause of those same regula-
tions which over the years has caused
considerable heartburnings and futile
consulting of lawyers is: “The Crown
reserves the right of making necessary
Roads and Bridges for public purposes.
And also to such indigenous timber, stone
and other material; the produce of the
land as may be required for the making
and the keeping of such roads and bridges
in repair. And for any other public
work.” Which means that the Crown,
"I'll ask him for a legal separation!"
without payment, may enter on to any
land and remove native timber and any
stone or earth rising above the general
contour of the locality. So it isn’t much
good raising a protest.
A straining of the resumption clauses
does, however, appear in the current
practice of the various State Housing
Commissions compulsorily resuming
land for the building of houses which
are later to be offered for private owner-
ship. Possibly on appeal the High
Court might declare such resumptions
invalid. However, as “G’snatcher” re-
marks, only a wealthy corporation could
take the case to court—W. C. C. (W.A.).
Our Neglected Wines
Salvador de Madariaga is by no means
the first distinguished visitor to praise
Australian wines. In an A.B.C. session
he expressed astonishment at our neglect
and lack of appreciation of local vintages.
Much could be done by winegrowers
and others interested to create a demand
for our better-class wines, and an educa-
tional crusade is badly needed. We
cannot expect ,the Bungs to take any
action other than a negative one—l lately
asked a barman for a “medium” sherry
and was answered with sojne hauteur that
there were two kinds only—sweet or dry!
Too many vignerons (see recent cor-
respondence in The Bulletin) are so
obsessed with the export market that they
neglect the potential home-consumer of
better-class wines. A taste for good
wines can be cultivated, and its acquisi-
tion would change us from guzzlers of
spirits and the more potent, highly
alcoholic beers into sober and discrimin-
ating drinkers of what should be our
natural beverage. Let our winegrowers
get busy on an educational campaign to
popularise the drinking of good wines,
and at the same time endeavor to alter
our uncivilised licensing laws. —Bibber
(Tas.).
Sheep and Inflation
Admittedly, high wool prices are a
contributory cause of inflation (B.
25/4/’5l), but it is only one of many
causes. It is most unfair to make the
farmer the scapegoat for our deteriorat-
ing economy.
There is no panacea for inflation. The
only cure is strong medicine to be taken
by all sections of the community. The
farmer will probably dislike it as much
as the rest of us, but he will take it as
willingly as anyone else.
“Ceg” is away behind the times in his
condemnation of modern production
methods on the farm. If division of
labor and mass-production are good
enough for city people, surely the
farmer is entitled to use the same
methods. The odd cow, pig, fowls, etc.,
add many hours per week of drudgery to
the farmer’s work, and, anyway, the
various branches of farming are be-
coming so complicated that specialisa-
tion is a necessity.
The most misleading of all “Ceg’s” re-
marks is the assertion that the average
smallish mixed - farm paddocks will
suffer from constant stocking with sheep.
Overstocking in pastoral areas certainly
does great harm to the land, but in the
mixed-farming areas sheep, together with
the clover pastures which are grown for
them to eat, are doing more to raise soil-
fertility than any other measures yet
undertaken on a large scale in this
country. Rising soil-fertility attacks the
very heart of soil erosion, which is a
much more serious menace to the
country than inflation. — Baba (Vic.).
Individualists?
“Fradelle” (B. 11/4/’5l) is wrong and
K. Ross (B. 25/4/’5l) is only partly right
in respectively claiming that
there are no individualists,
or only a few of them, in
our midst. The first is an
extravagant claim, the second
is nowhere near the whole
truth.
It seems apparent that most
of our troubles arise from an
overdose of individualism in
our midst. The way of life
of mid-20th-century Australia
is full rein for a brand of
individualism tantamount to
gross selfishness.
At its first level it is con-
stantly manifest in the be-
havior of nine in ten of us.
The war-time concept of in-
dividual survival has never
died. In civilian life it has
become every man for him-
self. Sell to the highest
bidder, buy whatever we can
from the blackmarket if we
really need it, strike to get
what we want, look after our own and to
hell with the world.
At another level, and if the term can
be sufficiently extended, there is “group
individualism” —one labor division presses
its claims in utter disregard of effects on
others, while every town pushes its claims
for finance or development to the com-
plete negation of the moves of its
neighbor. Organisations within small
centres clash, small centres in the same
region clash, regions of each State clash,
the States themselves clash, and, above
all this, is a Federal legislature split poles
apart in two completely opposite “poli-
tical philosophies.”
Surely “individualism” is only ethically
sound when it is qualified by “within the
common good”?
Under the guiding dogmas of law we
have learned to live together in a reason-
able measure of communal harmony.
Have we yet reached the stage when men
may learn to develop thinking to go with
their living pattern? When will men see
that some things concern all meq and
therefore must be faced squarely by all
men, each willing to sacrifice something
for common existence?
Only thus will arise the true justifiable
national intelligence that is the final and
all-decisive step to true internationalism--
achieved without the degradation of wel-
fare States or communal subservience to
impersonal government. — Arthur Cookb
(Q).

John Newton, who wrote the hymn
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear,
went to sea as a boy, became a most
efficient captain of a slave-trader, then a
Customs Tide-Surveyor, then a curate at
Olney, then rector of St. Mary Woolncth
in the heart of business London, the
church to which Eliot saw the crowd
flowing over London Bridge in “The
Waste Land”:- —
To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the
hours
With a dead sound on the final stroke of
nine . . .
In Bernard Martin’s biography John
Newton (Heinemann) there is a picture
of the church as it was a few years after
Newton’s time ; no doubt the clock stand-
ing out from its side is the same clock.
But Newton had even closer associations
with poetry: he was the friend and
adviser of Cowper and, as Mr. Martin
said in a previous book (The Ancient
Mariner and the Authentic Narrative ),
there is a remarkable parallel between
Coleridge’s poem and Newton’s account,
famous in its time, of adventures at sea
and of his conversion from blaspheming
atheism to Christianity.
Newton was the son of a sea-captain.
His mother died when he was six or
seven ; his stepmother had him sent to
boarding-school; he grew up sententious
and cantankerous; went to sea at 11
with his father; was obtained a place in
a British counting-house in Spain, but
would not stay there ; went to sea again,
would not say where he was put, was
impressed into the Navy, was hauled out
of the forecastle to he a midshipman by
his father’s influence, tried to desert, was
picked up, flogged, reduced to the fore-
castle again, and exchanged with a
merchant ship.
By this time he was hoping to marry
Mary Catlett, daughter of old friends of
his childhood, and decided to make his
fortune slave-trading on the west coast
of Africa ; he took a job with a slave-
dealer there, offended the trader’s black
wife, and was reduced to rags and
slavery himself. His father had a ship
sent to get him off, and the ship’s nearly
foundering on the return to England set
his mind on its way back to being'"
religious.
And so eventually he achieved a
captaincy, and became a God-fearing
slave-trader, writing loving letters to his
wife, studying Latin authors and writing
Latin poetry, going through Euclid’s
first six books, exchanging “2 small boys
of 3ft 4in. for a Girl 4 foot 3 inches and
No. 80 a small boy 3ft. 8 inches for a
woman,” torturing rebellious slaves with
thumbscrews, “correcting the Carpenter
with a Catt,” resisting the temptations of
the women slaves, conducting religious
services twice daily and writing prayers
specially suited to the crew—nowadays it
has a strange irony.
Some kind of fit or blackout ended his
sea-going career; he was obtained a
fairly lucrative job in the Customs ; but
after 10 years was drawn more and
more into religious circles, and
eventually, under the patronage of Lord
Dartmouth, and after some trouble in
securing ordination, became curate at
Olney at £3O a year. Here also Cowper
came to live, with his kind guardian,
Mrs. Unwin ; and Cowper would make
long stays at the vicarage when his
morbid insanity was upon him, much to
the scandal of the village, which held
unkind opinions of Mrs. Unwin. Mr.
Martin is anxious to protect Newton
from charges of being domineering with
Cowper.
In 1764, Newton published the series
of autobiographic letters which made
The Authentic Narrative; it became a
best-seller and went through nine
editions before the end of the century.
Another best-seller, especially in
America, was The Olney Hymns, of
which Cowper wrote 68 and Newton
280.
In London, he became the “spiritual
confidant” of Wilberforce, and produced
Thoughts on the African Slave Trade, a
pamphlet widely distributed by aboli-
tionists ; and when he gave evidence on
the slave trade to the Privy Council, he
was led up and introduced by William
Pitt. He remained, as ordained, a
Church of England priest, but an
evangelical, an admirer of Wesley and
others such ; not a tremendous preacher
himself, inclining, in those days of
swoon-inspiring oratory, to shortness
and, in Cowper’s word, “neatness.” He
preached until the year before his death,
in 1807 ; an alderman's carriage to take
him to the church, a businessman’s
servant to help him into the pulpit. By
this time, around 70, a great age in those
days, he was likely to lose the thread of
his discourse ; but when a friend sug-
gested to him that “his work was done,”
Newton shouted, “What! Shall the old
African blasphemer stop while he can
speak?” For he had been a mighty
blasphemer in his youth; not, Mr.
Martin assures us, a casual swearer, but
a calculating expert, supported by texts
and having the comfort of philosophy.
Mr. Martin has done much to re-
create the people and scenes of the
eighteenth century; one of the most
touching is of the old man, his wife dead,
walking past Bedlam once a day, and
waiting until his adopted child (his wife’s
niece) Betsy, who spent some months
there, waved a handkerchief from a
window. He would go with a servant or
a friend,
and when his eyesight got worse, he would
point towards the window and ask his com-
panion, “Do you see a white handkerchief
being waved to and fro?” No matter how
bad the weather, or how long the wait, he
would not be content until poor Betsy gave
her signal.
Americans in Paris.
H. J. Kaplan’s The Plenipotentiaries
(Seeker and Warburg) is a novel on a
theme that has been attempted many
times from Mark Twain to Frederic
Prokosch’s The Skies of Europe: the
innocent American abroad; so that
through the clear if puzzled eyes of the
visitors , you get a picture of European
life in its mysterious decadence.
But though the theme may be familiar,
Mr. Kaplan’s Pat and Tony are very up-
to-date, cosmopolitan and civilised young
Americans, and this book is really quite
a rarity among the ordinary novels of the
day; polished, leisurely and cynical, with
something of the genuine quality, as well
as the ironic tone, of Norman Douglas
or the early Huxley.
Through his narrator Phineas Strauss,
an urbane and faintly decadent American
journalist who has lived many years in
Paris and has known Hemingway and
Gertrude Stein in the heyday of the
American literary invasion, Mr. Kaplan
thinks both deeply and wittily about life
in geperal:
How can I spend hours installing stoves
and fixing faucets? First, of course,
because bricolage adjourns the real prob-
lem. It is a pretext for putting off the
struggle. Big also because ray life, every-
one’s life, is so charged with frustration.
War, collapse, constant crisis—-all this muck
we live in and no way out. The problems
that matter most are insoluble. How sooth-
ing, therefore, to enclose a small area of
experience and control it perfectly! The
tap drips? We’ll see to that! We putter
with the tap and it no longer drips. What
a vindication of the will and the intelli-
gence of man!
And he also thinks and writes with
remarkable clarity about the problems
and the psychology of his two young
Americans, who, in love with each other,
find themselves after a drunken party
with some Parisian artists waking up
with the wrong partners: Pat with the
artist and Tony with his wife. It is a
situation easy to cope with if you have
a fixed set of moral standards ; you just
scream, of shoot someone, or sue for
divorce ; but Mr. Kaplan’s people belong
to a generation without fixed standards,
and, very naturally and plausibly, they
don’t know what to do about the situa-
tion, or even what to think.
So they continue to drift along with
the wrong partners, trying to find out
what they think about it; until eventually
Tony decides that the French couple arc
merely “accomplices” making use of the
(comparatively) innocent Americans
while they work out their own compli-
cated marital problems—which seems to
be Mr. Kaplan’s, or at least Mr. Strauss’s,
final statement on the use which Europe
makes of its American “plenipotentiaries”
.. .that, and the artist Pierre’s comment
on the concentration camps which he has
experienced during the war:
People never cease arguing about how to
Jive in concentration camps. But it’s per-
fectly absurd to make such places. And
equally absurd to be shut up in them. You
Americans are optimists—you think any-
thing is possible. But my advice to you is,
stay away from concentration camps.
Some striking scenes of the war in
North Africa are worked into the novel
in retrospect, also a hard and cruel drama
of the concentration camps, in which a
German guard and a French prisoner
strike up a queer friendship, based on
mutual respect for each other’s toughness
and ending when, as his last gesture
before hanging himself, the German
orders the Frenchman to be shot . . . The
present reviewer never really cares for
novels of decadence unless the author,
like Conrad in “The Heart of Darkness”
and “An Outpost of Progress," can stand
right outside his story, and would have
preferred The Plenipotentiaries to be
narrated by the author instead of Mr.
Strauss ; but it is undoubtedly an excep-
tionally good novel of its kind.

Ramakrishna; Prophet of New India :
An abridgment of The Gospel of Sri
Ramakrishna (1942), translated by
Swami Nikhilananda (Rider), Aldous
Huxley describes it in a foreword as
“unique in the literature of hagiography.”
Sri Ramakrishna, who lived from 1836
to 1886, taught that “It has been revealed
to me that there exists an Ocean of
Consciousness without limit. From It
come all the things of the relative plane,
and in It they merge again”; and on a
more mundane level he advised one of
his followers who could not give up
drinking wine to “Offer it to Kali and
then take it as Her prasad, as consecrated
drink. But see that you don’t become
intoxicated.”

English; How She Is Spoke: Paul
Elek and Arnold van Praag (Elek).
Quotations from foreign guidebooks and
the like, printed in English, to show, with
humorous intention, how the language is
mangled; for example, from a French
phrase-book giving useful words for
ocean-travellers, “Give me a first, second,
third class ticket. Do you let out life-
belts? At what price? Can I have a
birth on deck? How long does the sea-
passage last? I feel queer. I must go
back to my birth.” Contributions from
Germany, Japan, France, Italy, India,
Hungary, etc., also the English civil ser-
vice. Some of the articles have
appeared in “Punch” and “The New
Yorker.”

Black Alibi: Cornell Woolrich (Hale).
A jaguar used in a theatrical publicity
stunt gets loose in “the third-largest city
south of the Panama Canal ; and there-
after a girl from the slums, a beautiful
and aristocratic Spanish Miss, a demi-
mondaine, and a young American woman
tourist are secretly and savagely ripped
to pieces.” As in the first Woolrich book.
The Bride Wore Black, the scene is set
for each death as a kind of short-story
character-study; maybe these will have
enough novelty for the reader to weigh
against the hoary antiquity of the
mystery’s solution.

Journey Through Utopia: Marie
Louise Berneri (Routledge and Kegan
Paul). An anthology, with rather heavy
critical commentary, of men’s various
dreams of a perfect world; quoting
Plutarch, Aristophanes, Plato, More,
Bacon, Rabelais, Diderot, Morris,
Richter, Wells and Huxley. A surpris-
ing discovery is the Terra Incognita Aus-
tralis of Gabriel de Foigny, published in
1676. De Foigny, who was born in
France and who, after a somewhat scan-
dalous life in Switzerland, died in a
monastery, was jailed in Geneva for the
“infamous and blasphemous things” in
his book. He said, amongst other things,
that all the Australians had six toes and,
“What is more surprising in the Aus-
tralian Dominions is that there is not one
mountain to be seen, the natives having
levelled them all.” His whole book, from
which Miss Berneri quotes only brief
extracts, should be worth publishing here
as a curiosity.
THE PRISONERS.
After our laboring train had passed
those blood-red sandridges gt last,
and, straightening out, went racing for
dark mountains in the desert’s floor,
I saw, in that red-purple land,
bearded Italian prisoners stand
beside the line until our train
should pass to let them toil again.
Then, clinging to the rushing car,
I leaned out, shouting: Come sta!
and, from blurred faces by the track,
heard: Beni! Beni! shouted back.
I looked and saw them where they stood
against those ridges red as blood,
looked and saw them lessen and
be lost in spinifex and sand.
There, we were carried northward while
my vision stayed and shared exile
with those men whom, I believed,
the blood-deep desert had received.
