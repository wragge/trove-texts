Verses by A. M. Bowyer Rosman
BUSH MAGIC.
Have you heard her calling,
The lone Bush, in the night,
When detvs are falling
And stars are shining bright?
Folloiv the last sunset gleams
Where, she guards the gate of dreams,
If you are her lover true
She trill smile and let you through.
Have you heard them crying,
The curlews in the dark,
Heard the she-oaks sighing,
And the wild-dog’s bark?
And o’er-blown in windy changes,
Tinkling cows’ bells on the ranges,
Or the magpie’s silver song
Floating with the dawn along?
Have you seen it shining,
The white cross of the South?
Have the gum-leaves twining
Kissed you on the mouth?
Then a spell shall hold you fust
Until life be overpast;
Though you roam the wide world over
You frill wander back, bush-lover!
THE FOLD OF DREAMS.
Wukcst still, O little son?
Shining eyes and restless hands,
Look out yonder, look away
To the cool, grey meadow lands.
To the margin of the world,
Where the sunset flags are furled,
Down the dusky hills of sleep
See the grey dream-shepherd creep.
From his crook wild poppies fall,
And his reed-pipes softly call:
“Little sheep, O sheep, come home.”
And the sheep hear; see them come —
One sheep—and over,
Ifinee-deep in fern and clover,
Tiro sheep—three sheep
Where the grass is thick and deep
And the quiet waters sleep;
Four sheep, five sheep.
Little lamb — sleep, sleep!
Where the dim dark hills reach down
To the tangled hedges old.
You may see the shepherd steal
To the gap beside the fold,
And his wild pipes call again
Through a mist like falling rain,
Till their floating street ness fills
All the h ollows and the It ills.
“Little sheep—O sheep, come home.
Night is falling”—and they come—
. One sheep—and over,
Two sheep — Alt, little rover!
Three sheep—four sheep,
From the vales and hillsides steep.
Pitter-patter come the sheep,
Down they nestle, in they creep,
Sleep, little white lamb—sleep!
—From “An Enchanted Garden and 0.V.”
A. M. Bowyer Rosinan collects her contri-
butions to this and other Australian and
English publications in An Enchanted Gar-
den and O.V. (British-Australian, 2s. 6d.).
She writes Various Verse with some facility
on the immemorial themes of roses and love;
hers is no clamant voice: she fines not sing
because she must, but because she has ac-
quired the pleasant knack. There is nothing
very bad in this fcollection —and nothing very,
very good. And in her minor and inoffen-
sive way she is a delicate craftsman in verse,
with the power to evoke an echo of faint
yet haunting music. And she has the rare
honesty to call her verses verse, though
many another who proudly terms his or her
product poems has less justification for
stealing such a title.
Anybody ever heard of Verner von Ileid-
enstarn? He is the 191(3 Nobel prize-winner
for Literature. lie is Sweden’s national poet
and novelist. He has come to represent to
the Swedish people the principle of their
new nationalism, of their new striving to be
a great and united people. It is because he
is the recognised spokesman of Sweden,
apart from his “vividness in the portrayal
of beauty, his psychological insight and his
stylistic ability,” that he scooped the prize.
Evidently you must be a figure of national
importance before you will be considered.
Look at his predecessors: Bjornsen, Mistral,
Echegaray, Sienkiewicz, Carducci, Kipling,
Heyse, Lagerlof, Tagore, Holland. Here is
a not too enticing sample of Heidenstam’s
verse: —-
Tiie Dove of Thought.
Lone the dove of thought goes lagging
Through the storm, with pinions dragging
O’er an autumn lake the while.
Earth’s aflame, the heart’s a-fever.
Seek, my dove — alas! thou never
Contest to Oblivion’s isle.
Hapless dove, shall one brief minute,
Flaming, fright thee to a swoon?
Sleep thou on my hand. Full soon,
Hushed and hurt, thou’lt lie within it.
Isn’t it about time that Australia had a
look-in for the Nobel prize for literature?
What about Henry Lawson? Lawson has
been translated into several European lan-
guages.
Australian
Since the anonymous publication- of Here
Is Faery —and it wasn’t —nothing equalling
its empty pretentiousness has appeared in
Australian fiction until the issue of John
Heathlyn of the Otway, by Lynn Ferris
(Ileath, Cranton, England, per Lothian,
Melb.; 4s.). The author hasn’t the re-
motest idea of constructing a story; and
though she—surely it is a she?—manages, in
a vague, confused way, to give some impres-
sion of the life of the settlers in the Otway
Forest, her use of dialogue is an obstacle
that few readers will attempt to surmount.
This is how the hero in his youth usually
spoke: “The true patriot is patient, he is. of
better stuff than that which impulsive
enthusiasm incarnates at any moment. There
.is nothing to view so much prospectively, as
that which is in the great perspective of the
traditional hills experience has behind.” John
was a bright boy, you think? No, for this is
exactly how all the characters in this extra-
ordinary yarn talk, though most of them are
uncultivated cookies and laborers in the Back-
blocks. Also, it is exactly how Lynn Ferris
writes.
John was well brought up by his mother.
She tells him of his dead father, that: “His
winsome sympathy was only equalled by his
natural and unaffected courtesy; he had a
charming personality, which so perfectly
graced the appointment he received in this
country.” And John reflects on his mother's
goodness: “With true love and little fond-
ness how carefully she endeavored to harness
upon her offspring weapons of defence adapt-
able to life’s varied social and domestic
encounters.” With such parents John could
not help becoming a bush missionary. He had
ideas, too. "The evening was very agree-
ably passed in the parlor, where a commer-
cial traveller and Heathlyn debated the ques-
tion of peopling the Northern Territory with
young Christian Chinese especially trained
to accept British Administration. They
became quite agreed on the following points:
First, that no race showed the peaceful
characteristic in such a patient virtue as
they did. The second agreement was, that
the Chinese were not likely to become an
idle people if the. country responded to their
primary efforts.” John has a discreet love-
affair. “During those years a regular corres-
pondence had been kept up at sensible in-
tervals. There had been no engagement,
only a high mutual regard.” And when lie is
returning to the city he puts Gladys in her
right place—after mother. “It will be grand
seeing those two dear friends again—mother
and Gladys.” Our diagnosis is that Lynn
Ferris is suffering from constipation .of the
vocabulary, complicated with wowserism.
Elizabeth Trent, author of Kathryn
(Ileatli. Cranton, London, per Lothian,
Melb., 4s.), at least knows how to write.
But lier story is merely a simple love affair
that resolves itself as the reader expected,
treated with a detail that the interest of the
story does not warrant. Ivathyrn is a girl
who’ becomes rich by a fortunate mining
speculation; and her lover also acquires
money by winning a prize in Tatt.’s. These
expedients are hardly convincing. Kathryn
suffers from a hereditary nervousness of ani-
mals and insects: and it is in one of her
moments of fear that she throws herself into
Bernard’s arms. lienee the declaration of
the cautious Bernard, more interested in his
books than in Kathryn’s “passion.” She
finds that he does not respond to her emo-
tional moments, and he rather despises her
for her nervousness. The result is the usual
lovers’ quarrel, which is patched up in the
usual way by Kathryn showing, in her search
for a lost child, that she is capable of courage.
The whole affair hardly merits the space that
the author has devoted to it. Beyond these
two persons there is little attempt at charac-
terisation. The author’s rather suburban
and prosaic style fails to give the story the
distinction that it needs.
Hubert IX Barton’s Reminiscences of an
Avstralian Pioneer (Tyrrell’s, Sydney, 5s.)
is an entertaining volume, written by a
shrewd old squatter who is more at home
with sheep and cattle and his opinion of the
Land Laws and of the unions than with the
pen. Ills experiences have been chiefly in
the drought-subject plains of northern and
western Q. and N.S.W. He tells an occa-
sional good story, but of more value is the
summing up of his life-long observations
upon subjects connected with the land. Of
Australian weather he holds the theory that
the cycles go about 10 years—a few years of
plenty at the start, followed by seasons with
a decreasing rainfall that ends in a drought.
Then begins a fresh cycle, with a plentiful
rain supply for one year only, followed by
one year of very dry weather, then the good
seasons go on for four or five years till they
once more peter out. and the drought starts
again. Having kept records of the rainfalls
and of the herbaee that those rains produced,
he offers a theory: “We seldom get a pro-
lific cron of the same variety of herbage
for two years running. . . .Prolific crops only
grow when some chemical required by cer-
tain crops is put into the ground, and the
seeds lie dormant for years, until, by the
decomposition of the various other -classes of
herbage, aided by the action of the wind and
sun, the chemical properties again predom-
inate, and cause a growth so profuse as to
exhaust the ground to such an extent that
it takes years to recover. .. .In my opinion
these droughts are sent for the good of the
country, because it is the only way in which
it would be allowed t> lie fallow. Had we
every season good, with floods and rain, and
the one set of vegetation, the greed of man
would overstock the country till it would
carry nothing, but....this country is culti-
vated by the Power above....lf we had no
droughts we would not grow the best wool
in the world, and our sheep would be con-
tinually in hospital, as they are in M.L.,
\yhere the merino sheep does no good. These
remarks apply only to the country that I
have lived in all my life.”
The author has an interesting theory of
the making of a bushranger. “In the early
days, anybody buying a holding claimed all
unbranded cattle and horses that might be
running on that holding. .. .The young Aus-
tralians were strictly honest- as regards
money or valuables; but, from my earliest
recollections, the branding of other people’s
calves was not looked upon as a crime; it
was, rather, considered a smart thing if
you were able to brand more of your neigh-
bor’s calves than ho could of yours; and
thy killing of cattle for meat on the .place
was almost invariably done at somebody rise's
expense. However, that condition of things
gradually changed, but a great many men
never realised the change; in fact, they did
not live up to the times, and continued their
depredations, which were then called cattle-
stealing. . . .These gentlemen cattle-stealers
(who, I am firmly convinced,"did not consider
themselves anything more than a little
smarter than the average) were obliged to
get further into the unsettled country....
and. of course, were hunted by the police,
and eventually the more hardened of them
found that there was a better living to be
made by arming themselves and going in for
robbery and bushranging.”
The author proudly relates that he received
the sobriquet of “the biggest, sanguinary
scab in Australia” from the unions, and his
comments upon the unionist and the* stories
of his conflicts with that individual are
equally free. This record of a strenuous life
merits publication, and the casual reader
will find much in it of interest.
War
Rndyard Kipling does good journeyman
work in his Sea Warfare (Macmillan, per
Dymodes Library). But he has a subject
that several other writers on the war, if
granted the same facilities as were granted
to him by the Admiralty, would conceivably
have made more interesting. The old Kip-
ling touch is here, but it does not seem so
Kiplingesque as of yore: these stirring tales
o! the mine-sweepers, the submarines and
the destroyers at the Jutland victory, are
told deftly enough, but always with the
merely ."journalistic touch. As apparently
Kipling lias got the monopoly of accession to
the confidential Admiralty reports, these
vivid sketches of the invisible navy will pro-
bably be the best that we will get for a long
time. They are excellent, stirring, interest-
ing ; but one dumbly feels the author striving
to recapture his old brilliance, though occa-
sionally the light flashes out over the
darkened water, as grim and startling as
ever. And for those who have not read these
widely published true stories in some news-
paper or other, here is a feast of fact aud
heroism that will more than satisfy.
Jt
Charles Hennebois, a French poet, was
wounded and captured early in the war, and
after suffering much ill-usage in German
hands, was returned to France a cripple.
In German Hands (Heinemann. per Sydney
Book Club) is a valuable contrast to Riou’s
voliun<\ since ITennohois’s gaolers were the
other kind of Hun. lie describes the German
patrols finishing off the wo muled on the field
and then robbing them. Luckily, after hav-
ing been thought dead and robbed by this
hand of criminals, the author fell into the
hands of a Bavarian, who rescued him. But
in hospital he was brutally tortured by cal-
lous and incompetent doctors ; and there is
ample evidence that on several victims this
mutilation was deliberate and vindictive. A
competent German doctor into whose hands
Hennebois fell later did his best to repair
the damage. The author is fair even to the
Hun, and his diary notes here and there a
good German of the kind that aren’t dead.
The great conclusion that Walter Wynn
lias arrived at in Revelation in the Light of
the War and Modern Frenis (Thynne, Lon-
don. per Sydney Book Club) is that “the
Book of Revelation is Prefigured History
covering the period a.d. 96-1928.” And his
explanation of the war is that: “It is work-
ing out the predicted prophecies of Christ.
. ... .It is the nyelude to Christ’s second com-
ing to the World, which is a near event.”
Good news for the evening papers. Walter
Wynn is another of them : by a system of his
own lie makes the Book of Revelation reveal
almost anything. ".101111 saw in cinema
form the things he relates; any other hypoth-
esis of his work borders on blasphemy.” That
settles all doubters and all critics, anyway.
Not only was John right in his prophecies,
but he was right to the exact daw This re-
markable assertion is “proved” by the
author taking his own theory of the length
of the year used by John and working it
out mathematically. John mentions three
unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the
mouth of the dragon, the beast and the false
prophet. At first these three frogs worried
the author, but soon lie identified them. The
three frogs are, of course, Infidelity, Popery
and Jesuitism. Dead easy, isn’t it? But
what about these three frogs: Hughes, the
Censor and the 1.W.W., the first coming out
of the mouth of the false prophet, the second
being spewed from the dragon, and the third
being expectorated from the beast? “The
answer in the Apocalypse (as to the activities
of these three frogs) is as much up-to-date
as vivid, and as clear as if Dr. Dillon had
wired it to the Daily Telegraph. But St.
John was chosen as the inspired journalist to
issue nearly 2000 /ears ago a series of
cryptic ‘wires' from the invisible Marconi
stations of the Universe, and we claim to
have proved that the earthly historians, from
Eusebius.... to Dr. Dillon, have been used
unconsciously to substantiate the Apocalvp-
tic prefigurations.”
"And the seventh angel poured out his vial
into the air. .. .And there fell upon men a
great hail out of Heaven, every stone about
the weight of a*talent ” What else does
this suggest but Zeppelins? And the author,
pointing out that the accepted weight of a
talent is 1251 b., notes with glee that in a
Zeppeliu raid on Paris a bomb was of
exactly that weight! What further evidence
does the devout student want? Unhappily
the weight of bombs has increased much since
that date, early in 1016, and is likely to go
on increasing. Evidently John marconi-
graphed that bomb', but failed to notify the
others. However, Walter Wynn’s interpre-
tation is open to proof or disproof, for he
predicts that: “Christ is to come to sweep
away the Church of Rome, stop war by
defeating in battle the armies and the kings
of the earth, and set up a world-wide king-
dom of His own that shall become as beauti-
ful as Heaven itself.” Well, we’ll wait and
see; but there o;: lit to be some remarkable
war-news soon.
WHAT BILLZAC READS.
“Brassard,” somewhere: The men in the
trenches are tired of war literature. It is
hard to concentrate the mind on rending
with so much noise and an indifferent light,
not to speak of a few other little drawbacks.
B r.jim has learnt a good deal about the
facts of life, hence his novels must be real
and bear the imprint of probability.
“Aok Pip Beer,” also somewhere: When
Bil'jim goes up to the line to take his turn
at Him-shoving (which is pretty frequent
just now) his fittings would make a swaggje
in comparison look like a naked man. In
addition to the usual web loaded with water-
bottle, haversack, entrenching tool and 200
of the best, he in usually festooned with
extra rations, petrol tin of water, a few
bombs and very, likely a sheet of iron or a
duck-board. And this lias to be juggled
along a slimy duckwalk over a morass of
mud. Not much room left for a library, is
there? Even when we are in rest (Lord-
elpus). which means marching about the
Country, there is a heavy pack to be carried,
and I have-seen a man throw away a good
shirt rather than hump its weight. There is
only one type of literature we can carry and
read with comfort- —and it is rather of the
Snippety Snips variety, viz., the English and
American monthly magazines. We should
like any amount oi; these. Some of the mush
handed out by lady visitors to hospitals
would make one weep.
The 14th Battalion Orderly Boom (per
Harold Wan less) puts its opinion thus: The
literature of the trefiches consists of: (1)
lltimorous, as a relief to the mental strain of
watching shell-fire, etc. (2) Sentimental, deal-
ing with home, etc. (3) Hastiness, books on
causes, reasons and history of the war. The
actual volumes most favored would be, say:
(1) The Sentimental Bloke and The Moods of
(linger Mich / papers like Blighty. (2) The
Waybaeks series. (3) The First Hundred
Thousand, by I. Hay; A General Sketch of
the European War, by H. Belloc.
It is curious to find, in war-drenched Eng-
land, that there' is a magazine still being
published that deals solely with poetry. The
Poetry Review, published six times a year
by Erskinc Macdonald. London. Is. a copy,
contains a mass of modern poetry, of which
the most interesting is that sent straight
from the trenches, articles upon poets and
.aspects of poetry, and critical reviews of new
volumes of verse. Among these, in the last
two issues, this page notices no reviews of
recent Australasian books of verse. It would
do., our poets no harm, and would do Austral-
asia a service, if our authors took the trouble
to send their books to The Poetry Review
for critical notice. The - quality of poetry
quoted in this London review is high—
but not so high as that appearing in this
continent.

The OHIO No. 13 STANDARD FEED and ENSILAGE CUTTER is also
a NECESSITY on an UP-TO-DATE FARM. The good points which a farmer
looks for in such a machine are these —STRENGTH, DURABILITY and SAIIS-
FACTORY OPERATION. The OHIO No. 13 contains all the latest IMPROVE-
MENTS, and is in EVERY WAY RELIABLE; From 4to 6 tons of ensilage or
from 2500 to 3500 pounds of dry feed can be cut per hour. By substituting
shredder blades for the cutting knives, perfect shredding may be accomplished.
With two knives it cuts 4,1, 14 and 2 inch, and i, 4, f, and 1 inch with four
knives. The speed is from 450 to 600 revolutions per minute. The train of
feed-gear pinions, clearly shown in picture, vibrate as the feed roller raises and
lowers, yet their movable bearings maintain the respective distances to each other
and keep the gears properly in mesh without friction, which gives a uniform motion
to the roller. The backwardly-inclined motion of the upper roller, as it raises,
assists in taking hold of the feed, and this, combined with other good points, makes
these machines strong feeders. Price

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

The HEW EDISON
Most wonderful of
musical instruments.
Mr. Edison has invited the astounding test of having great artists
sing and play in direct comparison with his Re-creation of their
work. Famous musical critics have definitely stated that they
were unable to distinguish between the original rendering and
Edison’s Re-creation of it.
Miss Julia Heinrich, of the Metropolitan Opera Company, remarked:
“Before I heard the Re-creation of my voice I used to have a little way of
paraphrasing Robert Burns, something like this: ‘Oh, wad some pow’r the
giftie gie me To hear myself as ithers hear me.’ Mr. Edison has certainly
given me this power. 1 have heard myself, not my approximation.”
The NEW EDISON is the culmination of Edison’s research work in chemistry and
acoustics, embodying a new art, and is a real musical instrument as superior to a mere
“talking machine’ 1 as a famous Strad. is to an ordinary violin.

“I WAS LAID UP IN A HOSPITAL;
but I am now completely restored

refreshing, thanks to your tonic.”
There are many commercial men in Sydney to-day
who feel the effect of the strenuous times
caused by the war and worry of business
too, so that they are after a hard day’s work
almost too fatigued to reach home. To those
men the letter published below, by a promi-
nent city accountant, appeals, for it tails in a
few words how jaded nerve-strength can be re-
stored, insomnia banished and health regained
by the use of this well-recognised remedy,
Clements Tonic.

“After being ill in hospital for 12
months and being weak and scarcely
able to walk, a friend (a chemist) told
me to try your medicine.
“I can most truthfully say the tonic
created wonders, banished my sleepless
nights and gave me appetite. I
thoroughly enjoy each meal. My health
is almost completely restored.
“Use this, as it is a man’s duty to
advise his fellow-men of the benefit
derived from a. medicine doing universal
good. I feel 20 years younger since
taking the tonic.

The Mother.
Out in the street he lies —
Blood in his mouth,
Dust in his eyes.
I stood at the door
Where he went out,
Full-grown man,
Ruddy and- stout.
I heard tlie sound
Of the marching feet,
Slow and steady,
Gome down the street.
The beat of the drum
Was clods on the heart,
For all that the regiment
Looked so smart!
I heard the crackle
Of hasty cheers,
As they rose like the breaking
Of crushed tears.
And just for a moment,
As he went by,
I had sight of his face.
And the flash of his eye.
He died a hero’s death,
They said,
When they came to tell me
My boy was dead.
But out in the street
A dead dog lies;
Blood on his mouth,
Dust in his eyes.

We set our idols up,
Boor little gods of clay,
And pledge them loyal cup—
Ah who so fair as they?
We set our idols up
And serve them for a day.
Fate casts our idols down.
Ah, who so sad as we,
Who gave them robe and crown
Of immortality,
To watch our bubbles drown
In deeps of Destiny?
But swift we raise again
New deities of d st
To serve with might and main
As faith decrees we must,
Though fast with thorns of pain
Fate fence our rose of trust.
And in the hour we laugh
To see them lowly lie,
Trod in the dust and chaff’
By feet of passers-by,
Fate writes our epitaph—
For in that hour we die.

Old Futility.
My balcony faces the shining sea
Alight in the dazzle and shimmer of morn,
And winds of the seaway breathe on me,
With scents of the sea on their breathing
borne.
I watch the waves on the wet, brown sands.
The wet sands tinted with brown and gold.
And they seem to me ever like futile hands
That clutch at a prize they may not hold.
Far north and south on the beaten beach,
With ever and ever a rush and roar,
They stretch themselves to their utmost
reach.
And then shrink back to the sea once
more.
And there they merge and are shaped again
To stretch once more on their fruitless
quest:
Yet how do they differ from women and
men.
Who strive and suffer, and may not rest?
►Since seas were fashioned and Time began
They have sought and failed 'neath the
callous skies;
And one is a maiden, and one is a man,
And Love, or Glory, or Gold their prize.
I watched Blue Eyes on the beach last
night,
On Eyes-of-Brown they were fixed alway ;
But Eyes-of-Brown in the pale moonlight
Were searching the sands for Eyes-of-
Grey.
And E,ves-of-Grey they were heedless eyes :
And ever and ever, like clutching hands.
Ihe waves sprang up ’neath the moonlit
skies,
And the waves shrank back from the
shining sands.
Though sand and sunlight and sky and sea
The gospel of joy and beauty preach.
The world is sober and sad to me.
For Old Futility walks the beach.

If I. of youth and hope bereft,
Should die dismayed, and you should be
On earth the only creature left
To mourn for me ;
And if I should look back and see
That you, regretting not your choice,
Did grieve to know me dead. . . .ah. me!
I should rejoice;
For life holds only you. just you.
And if you love me (how you cling!),
Then, whatsoever God may do.
Death has no sting !

WHY NOT AUSTRALIAN?
HUNDREDS of thousands of pounds are sent out of Australia
yearly for Motor Tyres which Australian Factories could
make —just as well if not better —and at a lower cost
to the user.
Every turn of a Perdriau Tyre means money kept within
Australia, and, furthermore, money kept within your own
pocket, for Australian-made Perdriaus do actually give greater
mileage at a lesser cost per mile.

Why Buy
Under-Sized Tyres?
ALL millimeter Tyres, except
Goodrich are TJNDETt-SIZED.
Measure their Cross-section
Diameters, when new —and See !
Why, for instance, should you
accept as “815 x 105” Size a Tyre
which only measures 815 x 96, 97,
98, 99 or 101 m/m when you receive
delivery of it?
Why should such a manufac-
turer’s saving in Rubber and Fabric,
be allowed to cost the Tyre Con-
sumer so many times that Saving,
in loss of vital Air-space propor-
tioned to correct carrying Capacity.
WHY should it thus cost Con-
sumers so much in lessened
life of Car, —in lessened
Mileage of Tyres—and in lessened
Comfort of Occupants —when such
Comfort is'the chief reason for Car-
ownership ?
When considering the foregoing,
bear Hi is in mind:—
Goodrich Tyres are the ONLY
millimeter Tyres that measure up
to the Sizes branded upon them.
Yet these FULL-SIZED Good-
rich Tyres cost you no more than
similar quality of other metric
Tyres, all of which prove themselves
Undersized.
* * ❖ *
MEASURE their Gross-section
Diameter —Size for Size!
Next, price them —Size
for Size, and Quality for Quality!
Then Test them out in actual use,
and prove that the average differ-
ence between Goodrich FULL-
SIZED Tyres, and all other Under-
sized metric Tyres results in about
25 % more value to Consumers —
25 % more fort —more Tvre-
mileage—and more Car-life.

THE GOODS THAT ARE UP FOR
DELIVERY.
Hughes made a speech last week at Ben-
digo. Tudor issued a manifesto. The words
spoken and written were presented to the
Australian elector as the foundations of the
party choice that must be made at the
Federal elections next month. To many
thousands of electors it probably matters
little what either speech or manifesto con-
tains. These are the people Whip would
vote Lib. or Lab. anyhow. But it is only
in a limited number of constituencies that
these people decide an election. Tlie citizens
who tilt the scales are those who weigh
policy against policy, judge parties and can-
didates by their promises and performances
and throw tlie ballot-paper to the side which
in the circumstances of the moment seems
to have the greater claim to support. Where-
fore Hughes is appealing mostly for assist-
ance from those citizens who at the previous
election put their weight behind organised
Labor and gave it a majority. Tudor’s job
is to hold that vote where it was. What
Hughes has to say is this: “Leave me where
I am and save the Empire.” lie produces**
a cloud of words in which there is nothing
definite but this. Tudor puts forward a
plain statement of Labor’s policy. It can
be easily understood. ' Where Hughes is
nebulous Tudor is explicit. One man has
a collection of images, without the breath
of life in them. The other has a policy that
is alive and workable and in at least one
direction touches upon a point that is of
the very first importance to the Common-
wealth.

Within the range of practical politics
there is no question pressing so insistently
for attention in Australia as the tariff. To
leave the position as it is would be maniacal.
The country is being deluged with imports.
The trading deficit runs into millions a year.
The bills are being paid by increasing the
public debt. Every consideration for the
national safety demands that this ; scandal
should be exterminated. Australia is being
so ia—fob votes —into an industrial and
economic servitude from which it is pro-
blematical whether escape within the life-
time of men now living is possible. Hughes
must know this. Every man with a spoon-
ful of brain under his hat knows it. Yet
Hughes has nothing to say about it except
to bombard the electors with platitudes,
which are all very well in their way, but
are as barren of meat as a bull’s foot. He
turns to this “matter of the utmost import-
ance.” He talks about it at great length:—
It is to the work of organisation and development
of our national resources, to win the war and hold
the fruits of victory, and to grapple with the prob-
lems peace will brine in its train that the Govern-
ment’s policy is directed. .
Then comes the anti-climax: —
While alteration of the present tariff cannot now
be made, the Government is pledged to deal with
the matter directly circumstances make it possible.
If this is not merely boring holes in the
atmosphere of Bendigo, what is itV There
is nothing about how or when anything is
to be done or how problems are to be
grappled with except by running away from
them. Nor is there a word to show why
the Australian Parliament cannot alter the
tariff. Surely Australia is tired of this tale
that the tariff is in the custody of someone
whom the Federal Parliament must obey.
Why can the tariff not be dealt with? Until
Hughes justifies liis allegation he is not
entitled to be taken seriously. If his story
is true, then by what right does he keep the
people in the dark? Tudor does not seem
to be acquainted with any reason why what
Hughes says cannot be done should not be
proceeded with. He puts it this way:—
If returned to power we propose to immediately
revise the Customs tariff, with a view to giving
adequate protection to Australian manufactures
and developing our resources.
Tudor was Minister for Customs in the last
Administration. He knows the need of
tariff revision and understands his subject.
He does not say that the tariff cannot be
handled. He promises to handle it. The
choice for the citizen who has a mind of
his own is between an offer on one side of
mere inaction justified by a bald assertion
of helplessness, and on the other a positive
declaration of intention to be active.
Hughes might as well have said, “Oh, the
tariff! Nothin’ doin’!” and passed on. There
is no reasonably sane elector who would not
regard this as an insult to his intelligence.
Yet it would get in a single phrase to where
Hughes arrives at the end of a thousand or
more high-falutin’ sentences.
* * « *
It is the same all through the piece—
Hughes unloading himself of words with-
out end; Tudor coming to such points as
he has to make without flourish. Much of
what Hughes says is right enough, but
nowhere does it lead to anything. He seems
to be eternally rushing away to the Back o’
Beyond and discovering himself off the
track; then hurrying back to get a drink
and make a fresh start. Everything is
left swinging in the air. Nothing is
brought down to bedrock. The fact is that
Hughes has no policy except to stay where
he is, denounce the other side and groan
that lie is being venomously persecuted. Nor
could he in the environment to which he
fled have a policy worth a pannikin of tea.
That side never had a policy beyond hatred
of Labor. They never wanted any other.
And on their behalf to-day Hughes is doing
no more than publicly hate the people he
had been associated with all his lifted and
spin vague stories about policies as e'vanes-
cent as the dew of yesterdayunoruing. What
conceivable policy could be framed by Cook
and Forrest, Irvine and .Tobiah Thomas,
Pearce and Glynn, De Largie and Willie
Kelly that would be acceptable to tlie par-
ticular interests they must now watch over
and obey. Hughes tries to clbke the nov-
erty of Liberalism’s imagination by a curtain
of fiery adjectives and mysterious hints. But
these are poor substitutes for action. There
is talk about increasing production, regu-
lating imports, fixing prices; about .immigra-
tion, about repatriation—talk by the yard,
but nothing more than talk. Tudor’s mani-
festo may have but few decorative effects—
it may even be halting and uncertain in
places—but it sets out what Labor has to.
offer instead of obscuring the absence of
goods with lumps of the dictionary and deco-
rating the vacancy in the window with fly-
traps. Tudor advances tariff reform, a
war-time profits tax, a relaxation, of the
censorship, sane finance, and amend-
ments of the Constitution as matters
to which Parliament should immediately
turn to find employment. Hughes, it is
true, promises a War Profits Bill—and for
tlie rest a succession of yells and shrieks fill
six columns of newspaper print, of which
four columns are devoted to proving that to
tlie party he broke with .six months ago
“this life and death struggle for Empire and
liberty is a mere side issue.” That is really
the crux of Liberalism’s appeal to Australia.
It is one which can only be believed by those
electors who, as a preliminary, are prepared
to find Hughes guilty of the grossest hypo-
crisy prior to the referendum earthquake.

“EMPIRE.”
The keynote of Hughes’s policy speech at
Bendigo was-Empire. It is a large word,
®and one that many a desperate politician of
the Tory brand has mouthed during the last
20 years in a frantic endeavor to avoid real
issues and escape the responsibility of sug-
gesting real legislation; but the time
has come when the Australian citizen
must ask what it really implies. The
term “British Empire” has certainly been
employed during the present war in a sense
that, if somewhat incorrect, has been at least
harmless. It has stood for Britain in com-
bination with the four large self-governing-
dominions ; and, while it may be true that
Australia can hardly be expected to aid in
carrying the burdens of the South African
Union, or Canada to lead,a hand in dealing,
with such problems as .may arise in Maori-
land, there is, nevertheless, a bond of
thetic kinship among ttiese countries winch'
gives them a certain oneness of aim and pur-
pose. But the very term “Empire” as
applied to this loose federation of self-govern-
ing countries is misleading. An empire is a
thing with a military basis, ruled by one who
is the supreme head of armies, and, by infer-
ence, a thing based on conquest, whose safety
is to be sought in further conquest. The
idea which lay behind the Roman Empire,
which s more or less the model of all mod-
ern empires, was a world-conquest that
wcfuld secure Rome itself against any possible
invader. Had Julius Caesar lived longer and
beeii followed by a man or two with his own
rude but broad notions, such an empire might
have been achieved ; and our present world
would then have been driving on good roads
to sure markets, with sound laws to p"otect
it, no frontiers to defend, and no pressing
need for revolution anywhere. But the
Roman Empire took a rest of a century or so
in its conquering progress, and that pause
made its ultimate success impossible. Since
then other empires have arisen, and each one
dreamed that it had in it the germ of'world
dominion. English progress had no such
aim. The Briton simply went out on one
occasion to plunder, on another to find a
new and more comfortable home, on a third
to reach a place where there was natural
wealth to exploit by a short season of labor
that might make him a happy idler on his
return. The result of all this variously-
directed energy was an agglomeration of con-
quered territory, overseas stations to feed the
central English markets, and new States
with progressive ideas and big democratic
dreams. Such a medley of interests, infant
nations and ancient lands held in more or
loss kindly bondage could in no decent sense
lie called an empire. Yet there were never
lacking those who desired it to become an
empire, and who saw in every land where
the British flag had been hoisted a jumping-
off place for conquest and aggression which*
might make England in greater and greater
degree mistress of the world. That desire
was fostered behind a very thin veil of talk
about “bearing white man’s burdens” and the
like by the party which is still foremost in
its shouts concerning the duties of Empire;
and it is for thi's reason that the gravest
sort of suspicion must always rest on the
term. Further, it is with the members of
that party and their aiders and abettors
that W. M. Hughes was chiefly associated
during his recent visit to England. There
is reason, then, to believe that the word
“Empire,” as he uses it, stands for some-
thing utterly foreign to Australian thought
—something utterly subversive of Austra-
lian ideals.
* * * »
The closer association of all British lands
and British interests, together with a com-
plete organisation of the whole on a military
basis, is the undisguised policy of a certain
section of Englishmen. To these people, who
view all the world in terms of machinery and
imagine that a similar action in Canada, the
Falkland Islands, India, Hong Kong and
Australia will produce in every case like
results, the problem presents no insuperable
difficulties. They assure us that the British
Empire can be closely organised into a vast
mechanical union; and the dream of sitting
on Imperial Councils which would sway half
the world seems to have turned the
heads of a number of small statesmen in
the outer dominions. It is for this reason
necessary to ask for a clear and accurate defi-
nition of the thing described by W. M.
Hughes as “Empire” in order that w r c may
know what he is asking our support for and
what sort of interests those are which he so
glibly nlaces before even the interests of Aus-
tralia. Within the circumference of the
thing described as the British Empire by
those who were so lately acclaiming Hughes
as a saviour and deliverer are many elements
which arc entirely onts'ide the scope of Aus-
tralian interest, others that are distinctly
distasteful to the great majority of the citi-
zens of the Commonwealth, and a good many
that are utterly abhorrent to every decent
Australian. If it is for the combination and
enlargement of these assorted discords and
malignities that the Prime Minister would
ask us to vote and work, his whole propa-
ganda is most dangerously venomous. If he
has another and totally different empire in
view which he only describes by the term for
lack of imagination to invent another, the
sooner he makes the point- clear the better.
One thing is perfectly plain: the only sort of
imperial union in which Australia could take
a share with a, clear conscience and some
enthusiasm would be of a nature that would
win little applause from the duchesses,, the
llakmsworth ipress and the crusted Tories
who lately rose to a bind of frenzy in
applauding the Prime Minister.
Long ago certain English statesmen who
did things and made little noise about them
were of opinion that England, the mother of
free States, which spread an ever-widening
girdle of British homes .around the world,
was a large enough ideal without talk of
Empire. The Imperialists professed to
despise the haphazard nature of such a
policy and wanted a closer unity, regardless
of the fact that any alleged progress along
their pet line involved reaction and loss of
freedom in the States concerned. The possi-
bility of world-war and the need for all Brit-
ish peoples to join hands for defence was the
chief text on which the Imperial agitator
hung his sermon. Then the war arrived and
the old British Liberal policy found its just-
ification. Britain -was unready; so were the
overseas dominions. But those dominions
did not stay unready. They rose with a
whoop and sent out greater armies to aid
England than England herself had ever
before raised for any purpose. It was the
final proof that the free-State idea was
sound. There is no proof that the Imperial-
istic idea, with its necessary sacrifices of
individual liberty on the part of the States
concerned, could achieve anything like equal
results. Once more the need is made
evident that W. M. Hughes should state
clearly and without shuffle or evasion what
he means bv “the Empire.” But Hughes w r ill
do nothing off The kind. To him the vague-
ness of the term is its advantage; and he is
not the sort of person to lose an advantage
for tlie .sake of. ..merelv clarifying public
opinion and. enabling citizens to have some
notion qf what;. they r are .voting about.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The gameness of these Australian troops who have
followed immediately on the heels of the Germans
fairly warms your heart. On Thursday, below
Bapaume, an Australian came walking in across
country, over the grass of a paddock, stepping
quickly. He might have been one of the hands on
a farm at home hurrying back from work to tea....
Presently, his message delivered, off he went back
along the same track without fuss and without
orders, just doing Australia’s work in the old Aus-
tralian way!”— Qflicial Press Representative Bean,

tic schemes to uphold. But the liberated
Russian is likely to take a very different
view. Russia, in point of fact, went to
war for no dynastic or imperial reason, but
purely because a section of the Slay race
was being hectored and bullied in an
intolerable fashion by Austria. The war
in the first place was a war of the Slav
people in defence of Slav people who were in
no way politically related to Russia. Hence,
if Servia is not restored, and indemnified as
far as is humanly possible for her ter-
rible losses, the Russian people have suf-
fered defeat. The spirit which first moved
the Russians to take up arms is exactly the
same as that which has since moved them
to overthrew their corrupt bureaucratic
Government. ' If, then, the Czar would
not grant a separate peace to Germany,
there is precious little chance that the revo-
lutionary leaders will do so. The fight is
the people’s fight, and the people will see it
through. Besides, Russia knows quite well
that Germany is the chief anti-democratic
force in Europe, and that all the evils that
have come upon Russia since the Tartar
hordes withdrew have been made in Ger-
many. The pleasant, gentlemanly slaughter
of the Crimea stands out in Russian
eyes as something markedly different from
other calamities. France and England
brought no racial hate to the struggle around
Sebastopol; but Teuton and Slav never
faced. each other in arms without the most
intense bitterness being evident. Burnaby,
the giant Guardsman who rode to Iviva in
the early seventies of last century, found
the Russian officers of distant Asiatic garri-
sons discussing possible war with England
on the Indian frontier as an interesting and
pleasing adventure; but oven there and *at
that elate the Russian hate and loathing for
Prussia was the dominant note. In plain
terms, the Russian people know that they
have no national safety while the strength
of Germany remains unbroken. The Teuton
is a perpetual menace to them; for free-
dom and sausage mix as badly as tea and
beer.
The Machine that Strikes Against
Itself.
Thus Hughes, orating the other day over
the break-up of the House of Reps.:—
I recognise that Parliament, as it is, is unwork-
and that an appeal to the people is unavoidable.
This remark should be cut out by every
Australian elector, pasted in his hat and
made the subject of cogitation, morning,
noon and night. And when he is attending
a political . corroborce and feels himself
moved to climb on top of the furniture and
give three cheers, the elector should restrain
himself until someone explains (1) why
Parliament should have been unworkable;
(2) what prospects there are of the next
Parliament not discovering itself to be also
unworkable; and (3) how it happens that,
one “appeal to the people” having produced
a Parliament which would not work, another
appeal can be expected to produce something
else. Of course, no one will explain these
apparently simple matters except by making
explanations which in turn have themselves
to be explained, and which bring the inquiry
back to where it started from. The plain
fact is that the institution known as Parlia-
ment is tied up in a knot of its own making,
and these “appeals to the people” are coming
more and more within the category of farce.
The Federal Parliament is unworkable
because it is the bond-slave of party, and
hugs the chains of its own abasement.
Elected as a deliberative assembly it follows,
year-after year, the rut pursued by other
Parliaments, turning itself into a warring
camp where one side bellows “No” and the
other side yells “Yes” ; where obstruction is
made an art and care for the public interest
a mere sideline compared with the encour-
agement of riot and confusion. An Aus-
tralian Parliament at work constitutes the
bitterest possible satire upon the intelligence
of the community which tolerates so gro-
tesque a perversion of representative govern-
ment. Any other elective or nominee body
proceeds to carry out its job. What would
be said if the High Court announced that it
could not work? Supposing a municipality
or shire council made such an admission?
With a .system of elective Ministries and
the restoration to Parliament of the
authority filched from it by Cabinet, the
“unworkable” Parliament would cease to
disgrace the country. As it is now, the
Parliament that is a shirker may just as
likely be succeeded by another of the same
sort. If it is not, the result springs from
either accident or intrigue; and a Parlia-
ment which can only be relied upon to work
in the event of something going wrong or
someone pulling a string is about as danger-
ous for people to trust their liberty to as
127 cwt. of dynamite.
Labor and the Referendum.
Tudor and his friends have again declared
their adherence to the policy of making the
referendum an integral part of the Common-
wealth system of government. The Federal
Labor manifesto of last week says:—
AVe propose at a convenient date to re-submit the
referendum proposals to extend the powers of Parlia-
ment. .. .giving the Federation power to legislate with
respect to the initiative and referendum.
In the same document, as well as in the
speech delivered by Tudor at Richmond, em-
phasis is placed upon the assertion that the
Fusion is a public danger because it may
again submit the Conscription issue to a
referendum. This was the yelp of the Labor
party at the State elections in N. S. Wales,
and no more stupid one could have been
found if the party had offered £IOOO for the
discovery. For the Federal party to repeat
the bloomer will be even more pathetic, be-
cause the immediate consequence must be to
heavily discount in the minds of democratic
Australians the sincerity of Labor’s profes-
sed admiration for the referendum itself.
Where in the name of Heaven is there
any logic or consistency in damning
the thing with one breath and in
the next saying it should be adopted?
On what basis can it be argued that there
Avould be a “betrayal of the democracy” if
the referendum were employed a second time
to test the feeling of the people on military
service, but that it should again be used to
find out Avhether the electors desire to have
the Constitution amended? This hoA\ T ling
about the iniquity of the referendum while
promising to employ it in the hope that the
employment of the people may be regularised
—this denunciation of people because they
may take a referendum and then an appeal
for votes for others because they tcill take it
-—is a confusing business. The Bulletin
has for years advocated the use of the
device, but when it hears an appeal to the
electors to support the referendum associated
with appeals that assistance shall be given
to make it look like the invention of the
Devil, the suspicion arises that the subject
is getting off the rails.

Poison Gao.
Thus the Prime Minister in his election
speech:—
The party which opposes us is made up of men
either hostile to or lukewarm on the war, indifferent
to the Empire or openly opposed to it; men who
forget their duty is to Australia, and put other
interests before that of their country. They appeal
to all that is narrow, mean and selfish; they come to
destroy, not to build.
Now, when did Hughes discover all this
about Labor? Only seven months ago he
was talking in England of “the spiritual
influences which dominate the thought of
Labor in Australia” and was trumpeting
the honesty of Labor as a political force —
its devotion to principles and to th«j sublime
causes of Truth and Justice. Less than
six months ago he was straining every effort
ot which he was capable to keep this party
intact and himself at the head of it. Less
than three months ago lie was inviting it
to come into a Cabinet with him. It re-
jected him —and to-day it is a vile thing,
either indifferent to the Empire or opposed-
to it, and utterly careless of Australia !
What can Australia think of a man like
that? For two years before the party
spurned him, Australian soldiers were being
enlisted: down to September, 1916, this
Labor party had recruited no less than
240,000. Did Hughes ever mention to these
men that the Labor party would sell them
and their dependants like jumbucks?. Did
he know when he made his wild promises to
soldiers about “farms,” and when he bragged
about pulling up upas trees and thanked
the Lord for the success of the war loans,
that he had behind him a gang of low-down
conspirators and traitors? If lie did lie
never mentioned it. That he should men-
tion it now is proof either that he has. spent
all his political life in association with an
unclean thing or that he is himself unclean.
It is for Australia to decide on the facts
which is the more probable. In either case
the answer must be a terrible reflection upon
Hughes.

Ignorance and One of Its Horrors.
“Red Lamp”: There is a widespread and
horrible belief amongst ignorant people in
Australia that venereal disease can be
got rid of by communicating it to a virgin.
The victims of the scoundrels who act on
this belief are mostly children. At present
I am treating a child, brought to me from
the Bush, for a severe attack of gonorrhoea,
which may cause her grave and permanent
injury. She is only six years of age, and
was in the habit of walking two miles to
school with no better escort than a brother
a year older than herself. Amongst others
I have had a patient of two years for a
similar cause. In such cases —so far as
my experience goes—there is no attempt at
doing more than communicating the disease
by direct contact; it always seems to be a
cold-blooded, premeditated act that has not
even the poor plea of passion to excuse it. • I
think that the perpetrators of these outrages
believe that in limiting the extent of then-
brutality they avoid the chance of. being
prosecuted for rape. The little victim, if
intelligent enough to give definite informa-
tion, is promised the most frightful punish-
ments should she speak of the matter; and,
even if they find out, the parents, and especi-
ally the mother, have the greatest repugnance
to having the facts of their child’s misfor-
tune made .public. The result is that capital
crimes go unpunished and the people are left
off their guard. But children everywhere
may be made a little safer by publication of
the scientific and legal facts, which are that
■venereal diseases can not be got rid of in the
way mentioned above, and that the doers of
such actions are guilty of rape and in N. S.
Wales are liable to be banged.

Our Experimental Legislation Plot.
Apart from supplying it with jam and a
cool place to go in the hot weather, Tas-
mania’s chief use to the Commonwealth is
as an experimental plot for trying electoral
systems. As the little Island hasn't enough
real legislation to' occupy two Houses of
Parliament, the latter started a good many
years ago, in a debating-society spirit, to
diverge from the rough-hewn old plan of
single electorates and simple single, votes.
The results have been most interesting, be-
cause most unexpected. Every few months
something that hadn’t been foreseen occurs;
and then the two Houses of Parliament have
something to do again. The most recent
excursion was to get over the by-election
difficulty, and it was done by practically
abolishing by-elections. Each of four of the
Island’s five electoral divisions last general
election returned three Labs, and three Libs,
to Parliament —under the preferential-vote
system. The other division has four Libs,
and two Labs. Now, if in this last division
one of the Labs, was to die, or was induced
or compelled to resign his seat —and recent
events with a bad smell attached to them
have set Tasmania thinking—nothing short
of an earthquake or other dispensation of
Providence could prevent his seat being cap-
tured by a Lib. at the ensuing by-election.
It was that contingency to which the people
who tend the Tasmanian experimental-
legislation plot gave their recent attention.
The result is an Act which provides that a
casual vacancy shall be filled by handing
the seat to the candidate who, on a re-
examination of the ballot-papers used at the
general election, is shown to have been the
candidate who would have been elected if
the vacating member had not been a candi*
.date. Apparently that will strengthen this
latest weak place to be disclosed. But it
takes away the chance which hitherto the
citizens have had of now and then saying
at by-elections that they have changed their
minds. Yet even that isn't the chief defect
of the new scheme. In these days of huck-
stering and caballing, what the people really
need is a plan for keeping the legisla-
tor straight. The Recall is the most likely-
looking idea yet suggested for getting over
the difficulty presented by the crooked legis-
lator. It doesn’t, however, seem possible to
work the Recall in connection with this new-
est Tasmanian scheme; which is another
way of saying that this newest Tasmanian
scheme makes it more than ever difficult to
rid our Parliamentary system of its second-
worst blemish. Party government is of
course the worst.
The Atrocity at Home.
“Trallwm” calls for an axe:—
We hear much of the atrocity abroad; let us con-
sider the atrocity at home.
One effect of the war has been to let loose the
casualty-ghoul upon the community, and especially
upon the war-bereaved. The ghoul takes'many forms.
There is the simple suburban newspaper-proprietor
who will publish the hero’s photo in his stodgy rag
for 7s. 6d,, paid in advance. There is the vendor
of the banal “roll of honor” (probably printed in
Bavaria, ready for the war), in which one inserts
the photo of the killed. There is the “History of the
War” fiend with his “official history” of (say) the
Gallipoli campaign (price three guineas), in which
will be inserted, free of cost, the dead boy’s photo
and history—a crude insert page in a bookful of
scissorings, stock photo-plates and cadet-grade write-
ups. But most insidious of all is the spiritual con-
soler, boosting his patent religion, generally Yank, as
the patent-food seller pushes his tinned barley-flour
upon the new-made mother and the layette-special-
ist keeps in touch with the six-months-wed. The
appearance of a name in a casualty-list—or, earlier
and better still, in the “Died on Service” column in
the dailies—,is the signal for the ghouls to swarm
down on the generally-distracted mother of the
soldier.
Last November the widowed mother of a more-
than-usually-devoted family lost one of her soldier-
sons in France. Two days after the death-notice
appeared a copy of the magazine of the Spook
Society and a form-letter of consolation arrived. Next
day came the official organ of the Behind the Times
religion, accompanied by a mushy letter of “com-
fort.” Followed the Bugaboo Propagandist, the
Mahatma Chronicle, the Harbinger op Trite, and
the letters pertaining to each. In her dejected state
the esoteric rubbish appealed to the mother; she fell
into the form-littered trap, and, inquiring further into
the Mysteries, was soon in the toils of the Fantod-
ists—with a Fantod prophetess wearing out the best
carpet, conjuring up khaki-clad spooks and leering
lovingly at the bank-balance. The mother began to
have regular visions of the “big horn and the little
horn,” and to hear the gunfire of Armageddon in her
sleep. After a month or two’s battling, sane and
watchful children at home managed to check the
ghoul-stream, chivvied the prophetess off the place,
and the mother regained her lost poise—until last
week, when there came the parson-borne cable
announcing the death in action of another son. Then
the ghoul-literature and agents began to crowd in
again. That mother is now under restraint —believ-
ing herself to be the Mother of God, and her dead
boys Christ and the Beloved Disciple. Her daugh-
ters thank Heaven there is no other son, and there-
fore a chance of recovery.
AVe have a press censorship ; censorships over films,
Germans, prices and noxious trades. But there is
no official keeping a watchful eye on Private Enter-
prise’s bowelless exploitation of the feelings of the
bereaved. Yet that exploitation amounts to one of
the greatest atrocities of war.

Choice Summer Drinks; also Dainty
Winter Feeds.
A CASE heart! in Sydney the other day intro-
duced us to a seller of soft drinks who sup-
plied flies and maggots by way of flavoring
to the liquids. There was no particular,
reason for inquiring what he was doing in
that trade. Anybody is allowed to start
selling things to eat and drink without being
asked whether he has even acquired the
modern habit of washing his hands. The
publican who sells liquors which are often
potent enough to slay the milder forms of
sportive; microbe is considered by the authori-
ties as to his personal fitness to hold a
license; but anybody can hand around buns
and lemonade, and if he elects to do so in a
filthy fashion he is likely to have a long run
before he is pulled up by the law. Pure
Food regulations there certainly are, and
the printed rules of the game can generally
be read through the accumulated fly-dirt and
grime on the walls of even the worst eating
and drinking establishments; but regulation
might go a long Avay further without pro-
viding any too complete safeguards for the
public stomach. Some of the regular prac-
tices of the common eating-house ought to
be put down under heavy penalties. Thus
it is the recognised custom to serve hot meat
and vegetables with the hands. The server
grabs a slab of mutton, puts it on the plate,
seizes a fistful of hot vegetables and dumps
them beside it; and then the smart waitress
with her fine show of white linen bears the
viands to the eater, who is wholly oblivious
of the fact that forks are out of date behind
the screen which hides the kitchen. Those
who have been in the game are ready to take
an oath and say that this is the ordinary
practice even in some restaurants of fairly
good repute, and that the professional servers
absolutely refuse to use spoon and fork when
coping with the hungry mid-day rush. The
Avliole thing boils itself down to the simple
point that some test of personal cleanliness
and decent feeling for the public should be
made before any person is entrusted with
the care of the citizen’s appetite. It is one
of those things which should not be left to
haphazard ; and certainly no one found guilty
of sewing flies and maggots as flavoring for
beverages should ever be allowed the chance
of repeating the offence.

The Paddy McCann, and other
Frivolities.
When Premier Peacock! was invited to
economise at the close of last session, his
persistent retort was, “Show me where I
can retrench justifiable!” Nobody thought
to whisper. “Paddy McCann,” probably be-
cause nobody in the House knew about Pat-
rick. Yet he is a whole volume of sermons on
waste and foolishness. About 30 years ago
the Gillies-Deakin Government of V ic-
toria sent a pilot to the Lakes Entrance,
Gippsland, and provided him with a smaL
yacht. The yacht served all right; but when
"the “trade” of Cunninghamo grew to six
steamers a week, the Government bought the
pilot a small steamer, the Paddy McCann,
and tied the yacht up. Itecently Cunning-
hame’s trade lias dropped, to. one steamer a
week, so, by way of economising, the Govern-
ment has provided an up-to-date motor-boat
and an assistant pilot, and Paddy McCann
and the yacht are both in the show-case.
That is, they are tied up to the wharf and
are regularly scraped and painted and kept
in order, “in ease they may be wanted some
day.” In addition to bestowing on Cunning-
liame two pilots and three vessels for its one
steamer a Aveek. the economical Government
of Victoria regularly dredges a channel down
the Lakes and through the entrance, and
just as regularly drags the mullock up to
the middle of the Lakes and dumps it over-
board. The brilliancy of this achievement
would have amused even poor old Sisyphus.
♦ —— —
Though the position of Ivan is still obscure
and nobody knows whether the revolution is
over or merely gathering head, the lesson of
the whole affair is one often repeated in
human story: that a system of government
which will not bend must break the moment
sufficient pressure is put upon it. Since the
Avar started England has undergone a prac-
tical revolution which may be quite as far-
reaching in its effects as the Russian earth-
quake; but there avus no shooting in the
streets and only a moderate amount of bad
language. England, being tolerably flexible,
could be bent into practically any shape at
the popular Avill; Russia could not. We
ought to remember this when next avo talk
about altering our oavii Constitution. The
tendency in some minds to make that Con-
stitution an object of worship, to think it a
divine affair that can last for all time, and
to regard as traitors those Avho 'would
attempt to alter it, is fraught with a lot of
danger, A Constitution is a means to an
end, not- an end. Like all things else that
are worth while it must he subject to the
hiAV of growth. If it is not it. becomes dead,
and the country suffers the unpleasantness
of keeping a corpse on the premises.

One of the first and plainest rights of a
democracy is the know ledge of the figures
relating to its own voting. The citizen
requires it for guidance, and any person in
an official position avlio denies him the
knoAvledge is an enemy to the democratic
theory of things. Under cover of the Euro-
pean Avar all sorts of irregularities have
been patiently borne by the people of the
Commonwealth. Suspecting greatly the
small men in temporary power, they have
yet endured a host of arbitrary acts lest by
violently resenting them they might do some-
thing to Aveaken Australia’s hands in the
war. When, however, most important derao-
ratic rights are filched, it is time to protest.
Last Aveek, at Bendigo, W. M. Hughes gave
for the first time the figures relating to the
soldiers’ vote on Conscription. Those figures
were the property of Australia' and should
have been available to every citizen of the
Commonwealth the moment the complete
numbers were to hand ; yet the Prime Min-
ister was apparently so dead to the sense
of duty that he filched the knowledge of
vital facts from the democracy Avhicli he is
paid to serve, and retained them for his
own special use. To say that the publica-
tion of the figures could have in any way
retarded recruiting or that it could have
been of any advantage to the enemy to,
knoAv them is to talk rubbish. Hughes
kept back those figures, which were Aus-
tralian property, until by giving them
forth he could serve the ends of the
poor party of dregs and fag-ends which he now
leads; and by that act he stands condemned
as one who cannot he trusted to deal Avith
even the plainest and most straightforward
affairs relating to a democracy.
Two reports abont the one thing:

ZINC OUTPUT.
Melbourne, Wednes-
day.—The Prime Minis-
ter (Mr. Hughes) to-
day in a speech at liar-
court, stated that the
day before he left Mel-
bourne a contract had
been signed which pro-
vided for the sale to
Great Britain of the
whole of the zinc and
spelter output of Aus-
tralia for the next ten
years, at remunerative
prices. For the first
twelve months of the
war, said Mr. Hughes,
every German bullet that
killed an Australian or
a British soldier was
made of Australian
spelter. Great Britain
drew her spelter for
munitions from Austra-
lia through German
channels, and the pock-
ets of the Germans
were heavy with the
profits w,hich they ex-
acted at the expense of
the Empire. Now all that
is eh a need. (Cheers.)
The spelter mined in
Australia by Austra-
lians, with the aid of
Australian capital, goes
through channels that
are exclusively British,
and finds its way un-
tainted into the muni-
tion factories of the
Empire. (Cheers.) The
German cancer that was
sucking the life-blood
from our base metal in-
dustry has been des-
troyed. root and' fibre.
It will never raise its

AUSTRALIAN METALS.
Melbourne, 'Wednes-
day.—A statement 'in
regard to the position of
the Australian metal in-
dustry and the arrange-
ments made for taking .
over the output of base
metals by the British
Government was made
to-day at Ilarcourt. by
the Prime Minister. Mi - .
Hughes mentioned that
the day before he left
Melbourne a contract
was signed by which
Great Britain would take
the whole of the Aus-
tralian output of base
metals for the next ten
years.
No further information
on the subject was ob-
tainable from Federal
officials, but Mr. W. L.
Baillieu, chairman of the
Zinc Producers' Associa-
tion and also of the
Associated Smelters,
Limited, indicated that
the reference was to con-
tracts entered into with
the British Government
some little time since.
Under these contracts
they had arranged to sell
their zinc concentrates
for ten years, and
also 45,000 tons of
spelter per year, as pro-
duced, for ten years.
The contracts made
covered their lead pro-
duction for 1917-18, also
the cooper output until
December, 1917.
In the rush of dealing
with a multiplicity of
subjects, the Prime Min-
ister probably misappre-
hended the contracts to
which he referred as
applving to all base
metals in the Common-
wealth.
The Telegraph’s report shows what trust
can be put in Mr. Hughes’s words. But in
the Herald, apparently lest the public should
kpow what kind of electioneering state-
ments the Phewsion’s leader makes, the wild
inaccuracies are corrected before they are


“GO ON THE LAND!”
has always been an insistent appeal to Australians; and when the Commonwealth’s soldiers return the appeal will be made with renewed vigor.
To place men on the land is not difficult; to make them contented farmers is the big problem. Under present conditions, the farmer with limited capital has not'an
easy life. In fact, more often than otherwise, bis occupation is less attractive than that of the highly-paid city unionist, with his regular hours and weekly pay-
days. The explanation is simply that the unionist, by organisation, wields a power that secures good working conditions and prompt redress of his grievances.
The farmer, on the other hand, helpless in his isolation, is unorganised and the victim of conditions created by those with the pow T er of organisation behind them.
There is.only one remedy for the farmer: CO-OPERATION.
Co-operation can secure for the Farmer Benefits equivalent
to those Unionism has obtained for the Worker .
By establishing their own companies under good management, farmers can save most of the profits which at present maintain armies of middle-men.
By co-operating for insurance the Farmer can effect his INSURANCE, AT COST PRICE.
Just two years ago a farmers’ co-operative insurance company was formed with this object. The first year was highly successful, co-operators
receiving a dividend of SIX PER CENT.

to hide a new idol’s feet of clay so early in
the proceedings. But wouldn’t it be giving
the public a fairer deal if it were permitted
to see the feet and judge for itself? Frankly,
knowing Mr. Hughes, we know what to ex-
pect ; and so do his late colleagues. But we
are reasonably entitled to expect- something
different from the Herald. Misguided that
old paper often is.' But surely it is not too
much to hope that, in spite of its new asso-
ciations, it will be able to remain honest.

The Daily Grind at the Misery Mill.
After all, does it matter whether llinden-
burg’s retirement at the Somme was volun-
tary or involuntary? In either case the
crux of the business to the Allies is whether
the shortening of the German line makes
the enemy more vulnerable than he would
have been at the old address. That
Hindenburg had good reasons for shifting
can, from the mere fact of his doing it, be
taken as certain ; but the immediate interest
of the attacking armies is with the old man
where he is to-day, rather than where he
was the day before yesterday. If the new
line can be held, the consequences to both
parties will be the same as if the former
one had been maintained. Changing a
battle-front may mean much or little, and
what this one implies, in addition to further
bloodshed, will be a lot clearer presently
than it is now. Pending further information
on the situation at that point, the news from
the neighborhood of Jerusalem and the
Garden of Eden sounds more cheerful than
the reports about the Hun torpedo. Bill.tim.
has been heard from in the vicinity of
where Samson gave exhibitions of physi-
cal culture, and the Turk is being
pursued in the direction of the Ilittites.
There is also cheerful news from
Russia, where, in consequence of “drastic
reforms,” the front trenches near Riga have
been supplied with bombs. Hitherto, it trans-
pires, the. munitions consisted of stopes. The
change would appear to be a desirable one,
dictated by “a sound conception of military
necessity.” It also hints to the public that
there are a lot of things it hasn’t been per-
mitted to know. And there are a lot of
things it is not permitted to know to-day—
and there will be trouble for somebody when
the public learns what some of those things
are. The facts about the submarine cam-
paign are still covered in gloom, though a
little thing like that matters nothing to the
land experts whose views on the matter are
given prominence. Of course Hun sub-
marines are being captured; but it would be
better to know that the number of subs, cap-
tured or sunk exceeds the replacements, and
that the new tonnage launched from British
shipyards is greater than that sent to the
bottom. Just at present, in the absence of
any such assurance, the situation on land
wears a more cheerful appearance than the
happenings on sea.
»
This is from a man whose observations on
coming war-events have turned out to be
remarkably acute: —
Nothing that we hear of Hun government in
Belgium suggests that the enemy has the least fear
of being pushed off the Western Front by force of
arms. The whole Belgian business expresses Hun
confidence in the future. The enemy’s Government
is not playing for safety but for victory, and in that
connection it seems certain that a big naval battle will
yet be risked. Leaving the hope of a German Revolu-
tion out of the question, cheap optimism never
looked cheaper than it looks to-day. In the German
policy, I repeat, there is confidence, and the theory
that “the Kaiser knows he is beaten” can be dis-
missed as an apology for slackers. The catch-phrase
itself is poisonous, and pro-Germans keep it alive with
their tongue in their cheek.
William Scott, who was the Ma State’s
first Government Astronomer, passed out at
Chatswood (N.S.W.) the other day, in the
92nd lap. Scott was born in Devonshire
(Eng.) in 1825, and at Cambridge was
“third wrangler” in the mathematical honor
list of IS4B. The first that year was Isaac
Todhunter, who after.wards wrote the school
arithmetics and algebras which Australian
grown-ups see sometimes in their night-
mares ; and the fourth was Alfred Barry,
who wore Anglican gaiters in Sydney from
1884 to 1889. Scott became an Anglican
priest, but, in 1856, when the Astronomer-
Royal was told to pick a man to start an
observatory in Sydney, he applied for the job
and got it. H. C. Russell,' who later suc-
ceeded him, learnt his way round the stars
under Scott’s instruction. In 1862 the chief
resigned through failing eyesight, and after a
spell at school-teaching, was warden- of St.
Paul’s College at Sydney Uni. from 1865
to 1878. He afterwards superintended
Anglican collection plates in various country
towns, and was a canon of Goulburn Cathe-
dral. Twenty years or so back he settled
down on a farm at Kurrajong (N.S.W.),
but had latterly lived with a daughter, Mrs.
Beit, at Chatswood. One of his grand-
daughters is Frances Beit (now Mrs.
Wittus), the girl whose pluck saved her
brother’s life some years ago in Fiji, when a
gang of our colored fellow-subjects from
India’s coral strand did their best to carve
him with cane-knives.

G. P. Fitzgerald, well-known Tasmanian
politician, who has just died, aged. 72, was
for long a Sydney man, though he was born
in Hobart. Ilis father wanted him to be a
doctor and put him with Dr. McCarthy ; blit
he preferred selling things and went into a
local fluffery. Then —in 1864 —he crossed
to Sydney, was engaged by Farmer’s, and
became a partner. From Sydney he went
to London to buy for the house down
south. This lasted till 1882, when he fell
into bad health, and went back to his always-
beloved Hobart, where he started a business
which became as well known as the Town
Hall, lie was concerned with a lot of
things in Tassy—including the Cascade
Brewery, the Technical School and the
Great Western Railway; and (speak low)
he was one of the liquidators of the. distress-
ful V.D.L. Bank.
There is a promise in the Electoral law
that it shall be made hot for any person
who attempts by threats to dissuade any
candidate from going to the polls. The
Phewsion Government’s mouthpiece, the
Argus, has, however, threatened the most
dreadful consequences to any man “who
jeopardises a ‘Nationalist’ seat.” Now, what
does the law propose to do about it? Or
is this law also suspended in the interests
of the Phewsion Government?
If returned to power, we propose to imme-

ported into Australia each year, leaving a
trade balance against us of about £14,000,000

effort to adjust this balance, and are firmly
of opinion that if we adopt a truly scientific
Protectionist policy we shall go far to solv-
ing the problem of finding employment for

Federal Labor Manifesto.
“Neither efficiency in method nor economy
in administration has been shown by the
Federal Labor Government,” declared E. E.
Keep, president of the Victorian Employers’
Federation, speaking in Melbourne the other
day. This commentator agrees with Keep;
but the amazing thing is that Keep’s speech
was made with the object of urgine the elec-
tors to return to power a party led by the
eminent blunderer who was at the head of
the inefficient and extravagant Government
referred to, and in whose present team oi
Ministers are four of the former set of
bunglers—including Pearce, the most tragic
of the lot. It would be as sensible for Keep
to condemn one bank because of the dis-
honesty and incompetence of its directors
and then urge the public to repose confi-
dence in another bank controlled by the
same crowd.

For 15 years those members of the Vic.
Parliament who were first elected in March,
1889, used to meet in a fine company and
felicitate one another on still making noises
in the old shop. Thereafter the numbers
began to dwindle, and on the 28th anniver-
sary tile other day Premier Peacock had the
handshaking to himself, for out of about 30
of the old brigade he was the only one left.
Veteran N.S.W. State politician Alt
Edden got back for Kahibah on. the second
ballot; and there was great rejoicing in
the Holman-Fuller Government camp. It
would have been unpleasant to see the fine
old man’s place empty; for a new man
would not have filled it. But whether such
victories are going to add to the strength
of the party is another matter. Edden can
no more leave off being a Labor man than
he can talk Greek; and the party which
holds him and some others like him will
have to do things that will make the old
Liberals weep.
The S. Aus. Minister of Industry, who
did not much fancy an export trade in horse-
flesh recommended to him by certain pas-
toi’alists, but promised to make inquiries at
the other end, has now got an answer from
Trade Commissioner McCann in London.
The demand, it seems, is mostly Scotch
(Glasgow chiefly), and is supplied locally.
“The trade is mainly confined to fore and
bind legs,” McCann says. “The bulk of it
is retailed at 6d. per lb., and I think, from
an Australian point of view, there is nothing
at all in the business.”

It was up to Australia to try her ’pren-
tice hand at a “crook” drama; but “Jinker,
the Grafter’s Mate,” produced at Sydney
Repertory Theatre on Saturday, does not
seem likely to win in a canter. This
dramatisation by the author (Con Drew)
and Oswald Anderson, from the yarn of
the same name, presents the unregistered
bookie and his clerk not in their natural
environment but moving in what might
almost be called polite society. From the
play one would gather that the sole aim of
these two cheerful rascals is to bring happi-
ness into the lives of penurious artists,
smooth the difficulties in the way of sepa-
rated lovers, and shed benevolence all round.
The real Grafter and the typical Jinker
.appear merely for fleeting moments. The
characters of the couple are cleverly indi-
cated by the authors; but there is too much
talk about their methods and too little illus-
tration of their tricks. Thus two greyhounds
are produced in the middle of I‘itt-street,
and the Grafter explains how lie is going
to work a coursing swindle. Subsequently
he recounts at length the successful working
of the swindle. The absence of dramatic
suspense or surprise lets the play down
badly. All the swindles come off exactly
as they were meant to come off. And the
examples of crook methods that the audi-
ence is allowed to "see are either very ancient
or very simple hoaxes, while, on the opening
night, one hoary card swindle was badly
bungled. The gentlemanly comedy is
swamped in talk, and even at 11 p.m. on
the opening night one loquacious character
insisted on starting an utterly needless ex-
planation “at the beginning.”
Were it not for the excellence of he cast
“Jinker” would die young. But Fred
Macdonald and Harry McDonna, from the
“On Our Selection” company, make of the
title-characters a pair of human, humorous
and consistent rogues. John Bruce, in the

Gilbert Emery, Harley Edwards, Barnett

as the tearful heroine; assisted by Elma

Coogee Bunyip, cleverly disguised as Andy
Kerr, makes a brief and unnecessary appear-
ance ; and Tal Ordell, as the hero, a
struggling artist, strives valiantly with the
talk that is allotted to him. The scenery
is excellent.
Arnold Bennett’s “Honeymoon,” with
which the Adelaide Repertory Theatre
opened its season, is a good idea not made
the most of. England’s chief flying-man is
three hours married to a charming widow,
when he finds that the chief German aviator
is coming across to fly over Snowden. The
play is of the 1912 period, when great honor
(and wealth) went to the first man to fly
here or there. His plans are formed in-
stantly : a week’s honeymoon, then all his
attention to Snowden. The bride is horri-
fied ; she is, she tells him, as brilliant in
her vocation —which is to be charming—as
he in his, and she has planned a full month’s

she exchanges much cattish repartee. with
his mother, a sort of matronly Corelli, who
.has shorthand notes taken of all conduct,
looks and talk, for use in future novels. The
curate-that-wasn’t drops in cheerfully to
apologise. His brother, a real curate, had
died, and he —presumably having read A.
Bennett’s “Great Adventure”—had just got
into the dead man’s clothes and taken on
his name and status. Ten minutes from
curtain-fall the bride might easily marry
any man of three—which means that the
action is of the stage, and not of life. Her
sole reason for finally taking on the old love
again seems to be that he tells her a particu-
larly mean lie.
It is a brilliant trifle brilliantly acted,
especially by Ethelwyn Robin as the novel-
ist, Nave as her husband (and steno-
grapher), Johnstone as the cheerful fraud,
and James Anderson as a bishop. “Straight”
parts are of course far more difficult to
play, and Wadmore, intelligent as ever,
was over-weighted as the liero. (The Rep.
has several first-elaSs stage-lovemaker's, but
they have all gone to the war.) Beryl Kook
did by far her best work yet. as the self-
willed bride —a fine part, said to have been
written for Marie Tempest.

The “Pink Rady” moves from Sydney
Majesty’s to the Royal on Saturday, and
continues the good work there, while lI.M.
becomes “The House that Jack Built.” The
Bulletin doesn’t know whether it is histori-
cally true. But, anyway, Jack Want did
have some kind of interest in it once.
If ye have tears, prepare to shed them at
Sydney Criterion. “Daddy Long Legs”
makes no extra charge.
“Very Good Eddie” has become a per-
manent and reproductive work for the Taits
at Sydnev Palace. It is now two months
old—and the Easter crowds are only just
about to sample it.
The new Follies at Sydney Tiv. bear a
second visit easily. The speechless: duck-
hunting turn of Billy Rego is one of the
first big grins of the evening, and the silent
drink that George Welch and Vera Pearce
have together his a good head on it. Jack
Cannot as a gouty old sport leads off well
with one of the inane songs he seems to
prefer, and which he refrains from teaching
the audience —unless there is khaki present.
Later on he makes a grand piano purr for
a song with Thelma Raye. Room should be
found for a Cannot-piano turn in every
future bill. Fair dancer Daisy Yates is now
well accustomed to the Follies’ work, and
helps everywhere.

These are the days when the side-showmen
at Sydney’s White City work overtime with
a cheerful heart and the bawling spruikers
are surrounded by awed groups of Dad and
Mum and all the young Gumleaves. This
is the life —better ’n rabbitin’ and nearly as
good as milkin’! The White Gity is a big
show this season, and fresh attractions are
continually being hustled into it, particularly
iu the form of free-and-easy carnivals, for
which the park is well suited. Dentine is
still doing his “death ride” and the Under-
takers’ Federation has finally cut him off its
list of assets.
The Smart Set is offering some choice

there is some attractive coster stuff which
Miss Georgie Martin is responsible for.
Prices are very moderate, and civility and
attention are a feature of the establishment.

The Problem of Woman on Sydney Easter
screens:—
Hoyt's: “Extravagance,” in which popular Olga
Petrova works overtime on her husband’s income,
and with the help of midnight revelries and luxuri-
ous frockings manages to clean it up very well.
Crystal Palace : “Sparrows,” a dramatisation of
Horace Newte’s sermon about the Wrong Turning
that the Girl Took.
Lyceum : Constance Talmadge as a Wild West
woman in “A Girl of the Timberclaims” ; further
Dorsey “Mystic Orient” pictures, introducing the
ladies of India who manage four husbands; and a
Triangle comedy, “The Male Governess.”
At Melbourne Majesty’s the course of
“Canary Cottage” will be interrupted on
Good Friday night by a sacred concert and
entertainment. The advt. doesn’t state the
exact measure of sacredness apportioned to
the entertainment section, but doubtless the
management will remember the Second Part
to keep it holy, for consistency’s sake. Mean-
while and until further notice the moving
drapery show first-mentioned will continue to
flourish on its color effects and its reputa-
tion for impropriety. “Canary Cottage” is
not really richer in original sin than pre-
vious legmaniacal proceedings of its type,
but the local Argus gave it a naughty char-
acter which stirred the soul of curiosity to
its lowest depths. The show is only a little
less prolonged than on the first night. Frith
is still a too-frequent wanderer in dingy
green pyjamas, pursued by the consequences
of derrink, and Connie Ediss proposes the
toast of Loose Moments as before. Also
she persists in associating loose moments
with tight clothing. Every night at 10.30,
or thereabouts, the gay and skippery Dorothy
Brunton refers to Maude Fane as a mere
piece of fluff on the affections of Jerry, and
sometimes the number of alleged bridesmaids
who start to undress behind a gauze screen
doesn’t tally with the number of girls who
presently reappear.
The Italian Opera Co. closes its innings

At Melbourne Royal the three weeks of
“Fair and Warmer” are nearly done. Marie
Tempest comes to Australian light on
Saturday with “The Marriage of Kitty,”
which is remembered by many people as the
brightest modern comedy the J.C.W. firm
has staged within the past 12 years. Miss
Tempest, who created Kitty in London, has
brought the leading man (Graham Browne)
with her, and the rest of the- co. is specially
selected-.
New turns at Melbourne Tivoli this week
are the Two Mayos, Vandinoff and Louie
Leeds and Leamar; also Zona Trador, who
plays the fiddle. Some of the old identi-
ties departed the other day, and Ada Reeve
comes as a long-felt want. In fact, the
Tivoli stage is waiting for Ada all the time.
It cries aloud for a Personality to arrive and
walk upon it.

Hoyt’s strongest pictorial appeal to Mel-
bourne at the moment is the silent story of
“The Girl Who Doesn’t Know,” a young
female who, in many cases, nurses the delu-
sion that she knows a lot. Marie Empress
■(of New York) plays the spinster in the
name part, and as far as it permits of being
handled with Rare Delicacy she lets it down
gently, so to speak. The same house shows
“The Upheaval,” wherein the enormous im-
portance of Love is duly accentuated by
Lionel Barrymore.
Nothing new doing at Melbourne King’s
for Easter week. The Taits are keeping
“Turn to the Right” on the bill for a while
longer, but “Very Good Eddie” is booked to
take his meals in Melbourne from April 21.
Annette Kellerman, “Daughter of the
Gods,” will witch the public at the Mel-
bourne Auditorium for the holidays. The
previous appearances of Annette had an
orchestral accompaniment worthy of her
beauteous form. The new season is to be
equally melodious, or more so.
CHARLES A. WENMAN, producer of
“The House that Jack Built.”
Cliarlie Chaplin is carrying on in Easy-
street just now at both Melba and Britannia
(Melb.), and where Charlie is there the
multitude mostly gathers. The dire conse-
quences of Jealousy have been pointing a
moral at the Melba, and now the “World and
Women” is about to rub it in. A strong
melodramatic corrective to Charlie at the
Britannia picture temple is “The Wharf
Rat,” which displaces “The Missing Link”
to-morrow night.
Adelaide theatres are all exchanging char-
acters just now, with Strollers at the Tivoli,
pictures at the Royal, and sentimental
comedy at the King’s. “Peg” is pleasing if
mushy, and the acting all round is unex-
pectedly good—which is meant for a compli-
ment, whether it sounds like one or not.
Italian opera breaks out at the Royal on
Easter Saturday, with “Trovatore” for a
start. The jolly “Follies of Pleasure” are
just ending their long run at the Majestic,
where Belle Verne, who mixes cycling with
singing, is a pleasant novelty.
After a mauling from the party machine
Bruce Smith managed to get the selection
for Parkes (N.S.W.) Federal seat. Eden

There were so many people yelling at
Sydney Trades Hall about party goals that
there was no one left to look out for party

The Argus tells the electors of Bendigo
that they “have it in their power to say
that there will be no rejoicing in Germany
at the defeat of the Prime Minister of Aus-
tralia.” If the Huns give any attention to
the matter at all, they would have more cause
to tvjoice over a Hughes victory. It was
through a series of blunders or worse on the
part of Hughes that Conscription was de-
feated and voluntary recruiting practically
killed at one blow. It is Hughes and his
satellite Pearce who have saddled Australia
with what is probably the most inefficient
and extravagant military administration in
the world, and a censorship that would have
coused trouble even in Russia under the
Romanoffs. And it is Hughes who is now
stumping the country giving out assurances
that if he is returned the Huns need have no
fear that he will compel men to fight against
them.

AT POVERTY POINT.
Sydney James, a direct descendant of
Valentine Vox, promises another novelty.
With Jack Waller he will produce what he
calls a “revuesque” at the Palace (Syd-
ney) at the close of June. The supporting
team includes that fine showwomau
Madeline Itossiter, with Connie Milne,
Cecilia Gold and about a dozen others.
Whether “Billy” will link up is unknown.
So far he has not informed this fireside
periodical.
Maoriland’s record concert took place at
Christchurch the other night, when the F.
C. Raphael party appeared for the Red Cross
Fund and counted up £751.
“Stargazer”: Marie Tempest is to open
her attack on Australian susceptibilities with
“The Marriage of Kitty” at Melbourne
Royal. With the experience of Johnnie
Toole and Terry still fresh in mind, I won-
der at the business policy of the forces be-
hind Miss Marie. Toole and Terry elected
to give Australia the comic stuff that
younger, fresher and more frivolous actors
had made familiar to us, with the result
that the comparative ancients, though figur-
ing in their own creations, appeared piti-
fully trite and stale. I don’t say Marie
Tempest is not very much a thing of the
present, but she has a long and honorable
past to live up to, and she is taking unneces-
sary chances in springing herself upon us
in the one comedy in her repertory that has
been exquisitely acted here. We all remem-
ber Rose Musgrove in “The Marriage of
Kitty.” We recollect the artistic triumph
she scored, stepping straight from frivolous,
musical angel-food and playing this neat
comedy with unique charm, peculiar talent
and naive humor. It was a glad surprise,
and as such is borne in grateful remem-
brance. Miss Tempest may do the thing
equally well, but she cannot possibly convey
the unlooked-for delight and the novel sensa-
tion the Australian girl handed us.
“May D.” : Marie Tempest is the greatest
living authority on the art of sitting down.
She once told me that only after seven
years’ practice was she satisfied with her
ability to take a seat on the stage without
danger to its springs or her own appearance.
Another clever performer who has
swapped slap-stick for bayonet is Edgar
Warwick, who, among other things, has the
felicity of being Maud Fane’s husband.
Warwick was here some time ago with the
Scarlet Troubadours, and last year was at
the Tivoli with Warwick’s Burlesquers. He
is now in camp in Maoriland.
At a dinner given recently to the Asclies
and their “Chu-Chin-Chow” company in
London, Oscar announced that he had not
been able to make the higher drama pay;
hence his staging of Oriental melodramas.
During the five weeks’ run of “The Virgin
Goddess” in London (it lasted three nights
in Melbourne) there was not a single paying
performance. Laurence Binyon’s “Attila”
ran for. four weeks and cost £5OOO, and the
only Asche Shaksperian productions that
brought grist to the mill were “Othello
and “The Taming of Lily Braytou.”
“Masetto”: “Ernani,” the last Mel-
bourne product of the "Gonsalez Co., lias not
been heard there since 1901, when William-
son’s Italians did well in it, Larizza and
Travaglini getting most of the applause. It
had its initial showing just 60 years ago,
being sung by Anna Bishop, Sara Flower,
Laglaise and Schluter. In that performance
Sara Flower (a contralto) sang the bari-
tone part of Don Carlo. Little novelties of
the kind were taken kindly by the old-timers.
In ’55 Mrs. Carandini played Gennaro
(“Lucrezia Borgia”) and Thaddeus (“Bo-
hemian Girl”).
■ The male principals of the under-rated
Gonsalez co. will make it hard for the next
management that presents grand opera at
high prices. On their merits as picturesque
actors, and on the rich, melodious voices of
at least five out of the eight, they are a fine
combination. The star tenor, Cappelli.
rarely sings below form, as older tenors are
apt to do. The No. 2 tenor, Balboni, is
sweetly robust, and the popular young bari-
tone, Scamuzzi, is remarkably versatile.
These men will be standards of comparison
when “Un Ballo,” “Mignon,” “Pagliacci,”
and sundry other operas are revived here-
after. Had the four lady principals been
equally effective the season would have
boomed" all the time, in spite of the war.
Certainly* there’s little Miss Yisoni. but she
hasn’t been overworked and has been charm-
ing in only three or four characters.
“0.K.” ; The most unconvincing character
in “Fair and" Warmer” is the wife who
wants to divorce her harmless hubby until
she finds him thinking of another woman
when lie is drunk. Kegarded as a feather-
headed young matron she is not comparable
with the frivolous lady in “The Night of the
Party” who used to insist upon visiting her
former sweetheart. at his apartments. In
“Fair and Warmer” the lover asks the
matron why she married the other fellow,
and she explains that she met him in Venice,
where love-music is always in the air. But
her conversation gives the audience no idea
of the sort of irresponsible fluff she is sup-
posed to be. Now, the wife who came to tell
her imaginary woes to Hugh Buckler in
“The Night of the Party” was not clear
why she married. She said: “I suppose I
loved him. I believe I did love him until
he grew those beastly whiskers.” The
character of the woman is revealed in a
dozen lines. She is incapable of loving
anybody, but she has a certain capacity for
hating a particular brand of whiskers.
A social innovation which The Bulletin
predicted before the war was a year old has
at last found a straight-out advocate on
the stage. At the Victoria (London) a one-
act play, “Nature’s Call” —with a parson as
part author —argues that the birth-rate is
the most important thing in sight, and that,
if a spinster is willing to assist, society
should not be too particular about the old-
fashioned conventions. But the argument
was amateurish, and brought more laughter
than cheers.
(Continued on page 26.)
“Partyman”: If tlie resolutions regularly
passed by the Australian Natives’ Confer-
ence in Victoria had but the force of law
the country would be on the road to pros-
perity in about a week. Thus, at Kerang.
the delegates agreed with their usual unanim-
ity on the need for increasing production,
decreasing the cost of government, develop-
ing the N.T., utilising the State shipbuilding
yard, a protective tariff and so forth. The
resolutions were beams of sunlight—and that
is all. Does anyone outside a Mental Home
suppose Australia will get a protective tariff
from Hughes, Cook. Glynn. Pearce and co.?
Couldn’t the A.N.A. drop its resoluting and
start a crusade for a party, mob, crowd, or
push of Australians, tied to no outside organ
isations or committees, but pledged to throw
its whole weight in with the Parliamentary
swarm which undertook to work for Aus-
trnlia, not talk for it? If 'the A.N.A.
liked, it could keep one political crowd
fairly straight, anyhow.
[F. C. Jones, Elgar-road, Burwood, Vie.]
The Argxts is invariably overcome with
confusion as soon as the writs for a general
election are issued. On the day the country
was called on to get ready to win the war

and pig 3 kept. He had seen 187 pigs on one stamped
out completely. All the children sent away to the
hospital at Warragul are making- quick recoveries.
It is as convincing an argument as any the
Argus has yet put forward in support of
the Confusion party.

A SERMON' FOR LENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here’s proof that 1 who now and then
Hot meats and spicy dish up,
When anxious for my fellow-men
Can preach like any bishop.
Life is, if but the truth be told,
An interplay of chances.
The Devil pipes and, young or old,
Each mortal fellow dances.
No gad-about would leave the fold
Were there no place to gad to;
And many a man’s been good as gold
Because he simply had to.
So let us each with joy declare
That when it’s sunny weather,
He and some smooth, conniving fair
Will wander through the heather.
The bigots brawl, the prigs and prudes
Inordinately blether;
But you and I, till Death intrudes—
Let’s both be good together!
Though life is short, short life may be
Right merry and delicious,
And chill Discretion seems to me
A spinster avaricious.
Here’s to the girls that gaily coo
And never are suspicious
Of simple souls like me and you,
And ne’er with scoldings swish us!
The gadrling jade will croon if we
Provide a place to gad to.
Ah, when 1 die, let none write, “He
Kept good because he had to.”
Mad is the Spring, mad is the Moon,
Warm blood is mad and glad, too.
Since Death is coming pretty soon,
Let you and I be mad, too!
Here’s proof that I, who now and then
Hot meats and spicy dish up,
When anxious for my fellow-men
Can preach like any bishop!

GOOD DIGESTION WITHOUT
MEDICINE.
UNIVERSAL ADOPTION OF ANTACID
THEORY.
In the old days pain in the stomach, after
eating or inability to retain food, variously
known as dyspepsia, indigestion ~ or gastritis,
called for the taking of powerful pain-killing
drugs or useless and expensive artificial
digestants; the usual result being big medi-
cine bills and an irreparably damaged
stomach and intestinal tract. Modern en-
lightened research has changed all this. It
has shown conclusively that acid and fer-
mentation, which irritate and inflame the
delicate stomach lining, is the direct cause of
most of the trouble. Specialists therefore
nowadays, instead of giving medicines and
drugs, follow the more logical plan of
neutralising the dangerous, acid by tak-
ing immediately after eating, in a little
water, half a teaspoonful of a form
of magnesia prepared especially for
stomach use, and known among chemists
as bisurated magnesia. This instantly neu-
tralises the acid, stops food fermentation, and
makes the food contents bland and sweet,
thus permitting the stomach to proceed with
its work without hindrance and under normal
conditions. Try it and see for yourself what
harm drugs and medicines have been doing,
but be sure that you get the genuine
bisurated magnesia.—Advt.

CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Harmless fruit laxative cleanses
stomach, liver and bowels
without griping or
discomfort.
An acid stomach, clogged with' fermenting,
ill-digested food, means that the liver is not
doins its duty. Nature provided ripe fruit,
juices to keep the liver up to its, work.
California Syrup of Figs— Califig —-is a
deliciously refreshing fruit laxative' which is
alwavs in season. You can keep it at hand,
and it wPI be an unfailing friend whenever
the tongue js coated, bowels sluggish, breath
foul, throat dry or sore, stomach full of
wind, and head hot and aching. You can
take a dose whenever it iS needed, as safely
as you could eat fresh fruit; In a short
while you will feel the benefit. The bowels
will be gently relieved, and the stomach
cleansed and - sweetened as the undigested
food is moved on and got rid of. The tongue
will grow clean again and the head will be
cooled and cleared- Xhere- is-.no mistaking
the beneficial effects of California Syrup of
Figs—“Califig.” Directions are with it for
adults and children of all ages. This
pleasant laxative is good for all. and cannot
possibly harm even the ./most delicate, but
you. must ask for “Califig’ - —California
Syrup of Figs, and look for the name and
trade-mark of the California Fig Syrup Co.
All chemists ... sell “Califig”—California
Syrup of Figs—in bottles, of two sizes,

SOCIETY
FORCE OF HABIT.
“Why did your wife leave you?"
“Force of habit. She was a cook before I
married her.”
“Crystal”: Justice Pring’s hair bristled
the other day as he heard an action brought
by a Mrs. Egan, of Broken Hill, against the
local Miners"’ Association and a few of its
named officials. The A.M.A. wasn’t satis-
fied with a Wages Board award affecting
hotel servants.; and it adopted the very
simple plan of boycotting those hotelkeepers
who refused to sack the employees who had
worked under it. Mrs. Egan was the snag
they struck; and the jury said it was worth
£450 to her for damages. It was a rotten
case the defence had, and Mrs. Egan would
probably have been squared long ago but
for two things. First, she isn’t an ordinary
Mrs. Egan; and, second, if Mrs. Egan was
squared there are 30 or 40 others who have
about as good a claim —employees who were
forced out of their jobs before the A.M.A.
would give the hotelkeepers permission to
serve its members or anyone else it had any
influence over. Just how abominably the
unionists of Broken Hill have prostituted
unionism may be judged by this fact. When
this servant-woman was squeezed out of her
job, she at first ran a boarding-house; and
actually. she. was ruined there and driven
out of. the business by men eating her food
and then skipping without paying their
board. The practice was so frequent that
there is hardly a doubt that this mean raid
upon the woman was organised ; and if men
who engage in a conspiracy, of that sort
haven’t earned seven years’ hard, nobody
ever did. Does the present Government also,
as other Governments have done, propose
that the ordinary laws of the State shall not
run further west than the Darling?
“Captain”: Some of our boys couldn’t tell
a brigadier from a corporal in 1914. Pass-
ing out of the camp one day some paces to
the rear of a major, I saw the sentry halt
the officer, ask him for his leave-pass and
make no attempt to salute. The major
snapped the usual, “Don’t you know an
officer when you see him?” “Sure!" said
the keeper of the gate. At this moment 1
drew level and took a smart and totally un-
expected salute from him. The major left
the earth with a roar. “What the —1
are you saluting that non-com. for?' he
bellowed. “Don’t lose your block,” was the
steady retort. “ You’ve got no stripes. He’s
got three and a crown.”

“Vella”: The firm of Hernsheim and
Co. has enlisted the services of his Honor
the Judge of the Central Court of Itabanl
in a debt-collecting crusade. Traders in the
Solomon Islands with whom this company
had business relations in pre-war days have
received statements of account showing
balances which are substantially in excess
of the original amounts, the difference, pre-
sumably, being for interest, although this is
not specified. Each statement bears the fol-
lowing endorsement: —
There is no objection on the part of the British
Administration of the Colony of German New Guinea
to payment of this account being made to Messrs,
Hernsheim & Co. „ ..

“Silas Snell” makes oath and says:—
It was on a recent Saturday evening, and one of
Melbourne’s higher-priced cafes was crowded, when
the lady entered. She was perhaps 55, a hefty
female of Dutch symmetry, and she carried an inele-
gant bundle and a live goose. As she stood there,
the observed of all observers, public opinion jumped
suddenly to the conclusion that she was possessed of
devils. The intruder spent the first few moments in
tailing a measured. survey of the diners. Then she
talked aloud, calling upon Gott to strafe the whole
cafe and its contents. A polite waiter intervened,
whereupon the frau dropped her bundle and the
goose escaped. The bird ricochetted off the bald
head of the amiable attendant, and floundered into
the dinner of a party of five at a central table. Here
it stood for a moment, one foot in the butter and
the other in the fish sauce, and then, with incredible
folly, strode into the soup. The soup was too hot
for comfort, and the goose forsook its footbath sud-
denly, but not without kicking a quantity of con-
somme over several guests. Its next action was
to goose-step with solemnity into the fat officer’s
helping of hors-d’oeuvre. Skating on the fifth
oyster to the left it .flustered into the arms of
the army, clambered up the officer’s shirt front, trod
on his face, and was considering further action when
the waiter grabbed. Eluding the servitor the mis-
trustful bird flew to another table, and lit in chicken
and vegetables for seven, looped the loop, arriving
unexpectedly, in the fish course on a third table.
Need I follow that wretched fowl on its career of
destruction? Probably no reader has dreamed of
the possibilities attaching to a liberated goose in a
crowded eating-house. In three minutes the frau’s
friend had laid the room waste and destroyed the
happiness of at least 50 people. Then it was cap-
tured and hurled into the street, where the Bavarian
lady was sitting on the pave, hoping for the worst.

The old doctrine that dying depositions
are bound to be accepted as true and final
has received a heavy blow in the S. Aus.
Criminal Court. A widow who died in hos-
pital declared, just before the end, that her
state was due to the action of a certain un-
registered practitioner. He was put on trial
for her murder, and the “dying depositions”
were allowed as evidence. But there was
no corroboration of them to be found, and
Judge Gordon advised the jury that it dare
not convict on them alone. The old theory,
“Going to die; must tell the truth.” is just
a matter of tradition. The English Judge
Stephen, who had Indian experience, used
to say that an Asiatic would argue: “Going
to die ; now’s my chance,” and thereon con-
coct a neat statement bringing into the
crime any enfemy he might want to get square
with.
SO TACTLESS.
AMURKAN ACTOR: “I’ve got that engagement fixed for us to go to Australia in the
company .”
AMURKAN A CTRESS: “Did they engage Fred!"
THE ACTOR: “No. the fool —he went and said lie was an Australian!"
The champion logician has turned up in
a Sydney suburban court. He arrived home
the morning after pay-day, still half-drunk
and without any money. His wife, according to
his story, “nagged” him because the cup-
board was bare. So he took her false teeth,
which were disengaged at the time, pawned
tliem, and got some more beer. He said that
if there was nothing to eat she didn t need
teeth.

“Gazer”: I’m a woman, and everybody
has been talking at me for a week. Talk-
ing economy and thrift. Even Bulletin
writers have been doing it. One the other
day counted all the new jewellers’ shops,
and then icily assumed that they were for
the trapping of women with
soldiers’ money in their purses.
I’m not arguing that the
young woman and the flapper
are not absurdly decked in gew-
gaws. But look at the male
—look at his wristlet-watch,
his tie-pin, his rings, his watch-
chain, his cigarette and cigar
cases, his matchbox and the
numerous contrivances for
keys that are sported by his
brothers. A glance along any
tram, especially in the “work-
ers’ ” quarters, and the amount
of tawdry jewellery I see on
the men makes me blush. Only
yesterday I was ogled by a
man of enlistment age with
five rings divided up amongst
his very dirty fingers. For
woman there is an excuse.
Man has made us what we are.
We preen our feathers or we
are passed by—and how cold
the world grows for the woman who is
passed bv ! Man hasn’t that excuse. And
I don’t know that I’ll call it an excuse
either, so far as she is concerned. It is
really, at worst, a perversion of a law of
self-preservation.
How a country gentleman put matters to

AN APOLOGY.
By request I hereby apologise to , of ,
for stating that I saw his daughter out with two
men at 11 o’clock p.m. I assure him had I been
previously aware such was the case I certainly
would have pursued a different route to my lodgings.
“Try Fluke”: The nerviest man I've
heard of outside the war-zone is a cliap
who some time back straddled his way
across the Waikato River at Orakei-Korako
(M.L.) on the telegraph wires. He was a
linesman, and while inspecting the wire-way
for faults he came just before dark to the
side of the river where it goes plunging
through the gorge at Orakei, 30 miles or so
below Lake Taupo, in an infernally wild and
lonesome geyser-pitted country. There was
no tucker or shelter on his side of the canon,
so he decided to work his passage across on
the double wir-qg. It was easy going, for a
telegraph man, until he had covered half the
distance; then the wires sagged deeply,
DUNNO.
HE ( cynically ): “All women are alike!”
SHE: “Then why on earth do men commit
bigamy?”
and there he stuck, -with the rapids be-
low him and a few dozen geysers spouting
cheerfully all around him like underground
whales. However, the linesman worked his
way along the wires inch by inch, and when
he reached the other side he was short of a
yard and a half of skin. I know that Orakei
hot-spring valley well, and I'd sooner starve
in the fern a week than tackle a job that as
likely as not would land me down the throat
of a scalding pula.
IN PALESTINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hove, where Goliath strode, when down from Gath
lie bore the clanking armor of his pride,
To stand as champion in Israel’s path
Ere yet the shepherd lad his strength defied,
Australia, ’twixt the mountains and the sea,
Rides gaily on to final victory.
Judaean hills are grim with coming- Spring-;
The ancient olives rustle in the breeze;
The fig puts forth its fruit; all birds that sing
Are flitting in the immemorial trees
Set in deep vales where bubbling waters tell
Of Judah’s stately daughters at the wolf.
Somewhere perchance across wide pasture lands
The bridle jingles and the troop goes by,
Or the lone scout upon the hilltop stands
With Hebron’s fruitful vale beneath his eye;
And all below, around the rock and sod.
Breathe memories of the patriarch Friend of God.
Swift, on high wing, the soaring aeroplane
Glimpses a. wider land than Moses knew
When upon Pisgah’s peak, in age and pain,
The b’ jad forbidden landscape met his view;
And f r above the tents of trembling Shem
The i dot sees hill-set Jerusalem.
The armies move. The guns of ruin flame.
Around the world the eager message flies,
Crowded with stirring deed and ancient name
And victory crowning splendid enterprise,
Till Billjim junior in his Sunday-school
Takes a new interest in Siloam’s pool
Prophet and psalmist, priest and Saviour breathed
This air that swell’s Australia’s triumph on.
The battle-smoke is -incense fiercely breathed
Around a far world-glory past and gone ;
But holy deeds of battle lend new grace
Of fresh remembrance to each holy place.

There are a dozen reservoirs in Australia
bigger than the 210,000,000-gallon hole at
Ridgeway, near Hobart, how close-up
finished; but its dam is a record for height.
After the job was begun it was found that
the ground was all faults and cracks, so
they had to do some deep-sinking to find a
bottom. In the middle of the central arch
the concrete Avail starts 165 ft. beloAV the
surface, and 135 ft. above makes the total
280 ft. The wall is 70ft. thick at the bot-
tom, while the side Avails go 10ft. better than
that. A good many people still doubt
Avhether the dam will hold Avhen it gets a
million tons or so of Avater against it. If
there’s anything in the old pagan idea of
blood being the best cement it will, for it
has cost more than one life in the building.

“L.F.8.” : When the last British hospital
ship Avas torpedoed by the. Huns I searched
my bookcase for the “Narrative of Voyages
and Commercial Enterprises” of Richard J.
Cleveland, a Boston trader of a century ago
(E. Moxon, London, 1842) :
A few days previous the English blockading
squadron had arrived at Mauritius under command of
Commodore Hotham. These, on the day of the
funeral obsequies, as a mark of respect for the
deceased General Malartie (late French Governor),
came down from windward and lay by, off the
entrance to the harbor, with their colors hoisted half-
mast and firing minute guns. Such a tribute of
respect from an enemy is so magnanimous that it
cannot fail to be considered honorable to both parties;
and while such acts meet the applause of the civilised
world they will also have their influence in diminish-
ing the asperities and miseries of war.
Yes, I believe avc are a bit different.
“K.Q.”: Tlie return of the Aurora from
the Relief Expedition doAvn among the ice-
bergs recalls an interesting act played by the
Avireless-operator of the party at the time
the Emden was kicking about the Indian
Ocean. “Sparks” Avas then engaged “jerk-
ing lightning” through space from Sydney,
and being unable to obtain leave to say good-
bye to his Billjim brother, he chanced a
wireless farewell memo, via Melbourne to
the troopship Avhen she Avas somewhere
south of Australia. All Avas “G.K.” till the
unthouglitful operator on a Union steamer
got to work. He picked up the message, and
told Melbourne the whereabouts of the troop-
ship, adding that Melbourne needn’t repeat
the message as the ship would get it herself,
she having just passed a certain point.
COMPROMISE.
“If I died and went to Heaven could I take
my dolls with me?”
“I’m afraid not, darling.”
“Not even my little Kewpie?”
"No, not even little Kewpie.”
“Well, if I go to Hell can I take the golli-
wog?”
f ,
There was a big fuss over that message; yet
probably many Billpms lives were saved as
a result of it for this and other troopships
were promptly detained. And there is
hardly a doubt that through that detention
a meeting with the Linden was averted.
“We saw the Germans running helter-
skelter beyond Bapaume, with here and there
a flag providing a dot of color,” says war-
correspondent Palmer.
The Germans ran for two Avliole days.
AVe saw their banners in the blast.
And now Avliere is the man who says
That German colors are not fast?
The Avay of the orator is getting harder.
Adelaide makes far more fuss of its returning
soldiers than any other city, and Mayor
Isaacs has been largely responsible for it. But
apparently Billjim doesn’t like it altogether,
CATTISH.
HE: “She’s the sort that would say ‘This is so sudden’ if one proposed to her.”
SHE: “Not a bit. She’d say, ‘Thank Heaven, at last!’”
and at the last City Council meeting it was
asked if it is really necessary for the
returned men to be drawn up on the railway
station platform while speeches are made
at them. The Mayor promised that only
he and the Premier will in future orate, and
that they will take only a minute and a half
each. Even then there was an irreverent
councillor who wanted to know whether it
couldn’t be cut down to a minute.

“Harrison O.”: One of the chief amuse-
ments in country townships to which even
C. Chaplin rarely penetrates is visiting the
dentist. I have lately
called at some out-
of - the - way Victorian
hamlets, and nearly
always met simple rural
maidens who proudly dis-
played gold-filled teeth.
Villages that cannot per-
manently support a
tooth-plumber are visited
by one fortnightly or
monthly, and on his
visiting days the pub
where he operates is in-
variably haunted by the
local beauty and chivalry.
Going to the dentist is
as much a form of enter-
tainment with them as a
visit to the pictures is
with suburbanites. If
the gent, with the for-
ceps is not too much
over 50 he comes in for
the adulation which city
females reserve for
beauty mummers. In
other ways, too, the den-
tist fills the actor’s place.
He stuffs a hollow head
with romance and puts
poetry into the mouths of
grown-up babes and suck-
lings. Gold-fillings for
decorative purposes seem
specially popular in rural
parts. There were times
when, talking to wenches
on farms and in country
stores and pubs, I thought
I was looking into the
golden mouth of ray
own favorite Melbourne
barlady.
Advt.- for the New Domestic in a Mel-
bourne daily:—
Two adults (gentleman, daughter) wish Lady
join performance household duties, washing excluded
But a statement about wages would pro-
bably attract more attention than the ex-
cluded washing.
Irrepressible Billjim! The boys were
changing guard in one of the unspeakable
Avinter trenches in France, and the mud-
caked “off duties” were giving place to the
clean-clad “ons.” One youth bent dotvn on
the board duckwalk and swilled his muddy
hands in the water filling the bottom of the
trench. “Here, Avhat arc you doing?”
said one of the relief. “Doing?” asked the
other. “Yes, washing your dirty hands in
the water we’ve got to sleep in!” grinned
Bill. And Bill had been a bank-clerk before
he enlisted.
The High Court the other day hammered
another hole through one of the worst prin-
ciples the Commonwealth Income Tax people
ever tried to lay down. A prudent Board of
directors never pays away, in normal times,
the uttermost penny of profit that the com-
pany has made or thinks it has made. There-
fore, as time goes on, there is a greater or
less accumulation of undivided profit—not
necessarily in cash, of course, but more
often money used in the business, and there-
fore represented by stock or something of
that sort. Say a company had £lO,OOO thus
accumulated at the end of 1015. In 1916 it
made another £lO,OOO and paid in dividends
£SOOO. Now, mid'", the Commonwealth law,
the sharehold i - * individually pay income
tax on the £8000; the co. pays tax only on
the undivided balance. A mere ordinary
man would say that that taxable balance
was £2OOO. “Oh, no,” said the Income Tax
people. “Of that £BOOO that was divided
£4OOO was paid out of the accumulated
£1.0,000, and only the other £4OOO out of the
£lO,OOO earned during the year, thus leaving
£6OOO on which the co. is taxable. It is the
habit of taking points like that which pro-
duces the very unfortunate impression that
Income Tax ‘Departments are tricky con-
cerns, out to “beat” the taxpayer. Griffith,
C.J., as might have been expected, said
“Pooh!” to the Department’s claim; and the
High Court, being appealed to, remarked
“Pooh!” four times over. “So far as the
dividend was less than the sum made as pro-
fits during the period under review,” said
Barton, J., “it was by the Act deductible
from the total income of the period, and not,
as assumed by the Commissioner, from the
accumulated income of the co.” The case
was a Victorian one—the Foster Brewing
Co. v. the Commissioner.
“Engaged” : Next time the ’phone is work-
ing badly, I’ll refrain from making a corn-
plaint for fear some angry offi-
cial should ask me to describe the
effect nf the Brazilian current on
the Atlantic Ocean. They have
to know things like that in
Webster’s Post Office; and offi-
cers in search of higher promo-
tion have to read even deeper
and find out how far the disturb-
ances in Thibet affected the
Guatemalan Republic. The High
Court discovered these inner
secrets of the Telephone Depart-
ment while hearing the evidence
of the “Hello” girls and boys who
want a little more wages and are
prepared to go a long way to
get it. While they are pursuing
promotion by the prescribed
Chinese method, the bells and
shutters of distracted subscribers
indicate roughly how many igno-
rant outsiders are qualifying for
the lunatic asylum in the good
old way. Webster seems to be
the sort of P.M.G. who merely
fastens new fads of his own to
the stupid old ones.

“Reggie”: Apropos the Aus-
tralian silver coinage and the
surprise of Billjim. to find it
wasn’t currency outside Austra-
lia (B. 29/3/’l7). Last time I
was on “Blighty leave” I- bought
a magazine and tendered in pay-
ment for it an Australian shilling.
The girl returned the coin. “Bird-
nnd-rat sliillin’s is no good in England,” she
told me confidentially.

If Admiral Beatty is late for his next
appointment with the German High Seas
Fleet it will probably be because he has
politely detained himself to compose a letter
of thanks to the town trombone. After the last
sea scurry, the secretary of the little Enroa
(Vic.) band sat down full of martial fury
and wrote a letter of congratulation to the
whirling sailor who opened the Jutland ball,
Weeks later Beatty said a word, and a
typewriter chattered his metallic teeth m
the stomach of the “Iron Duke.” W hen the
note reached Australia, it made the band
feel very proud (bands are illogical ani-
mals). But it might quite easily have dis-
tracted Beatty’s attention and lost a battle,
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos the
late S. Aus. Chief Justice Way’s ol<J-age
habit of reserving judgments almost inter-
minably, in dread lest he should at last
deliver one that Avould be upset on appeal.
The late Judge Cope beard an appeal in
Melbourne from a decision of a suburban
bench of magistrates, fining a man for
severely handling a Chinaman under provoca-
tion. He was unable to upset the finding;
yet, if he affirmed the conviction, the man,
Avho was a law-abiding citizen, must go to
gaol. His Honor said he would reserve his
decision, and up to the moment of his death,
20 years after, it was still reserved.
SLOW GOING.
THE TIMID ONE: “ I — er —really must have
a kiss—before I — er—leave you to-
night!”
THE OTHER: “Good gracious! You can't
stay here all night.”
HER MA AND PA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I go to see my dearest dear.
\\ T e find a hammock in the garden.
I murmur softly in her
A dry, harsh voice discharges “Pardon !’
It is her pa.
I see with hate his long, red nose is
A-gleam among the paler roses.
And there is ma.
They look at me with awful eyes
In which a fell suspicion lies.
I call on her when night has come,
And sit beside my black-eyed fairy;
The light goes down ; she’s cuddlesomo—
But comes a stern, explosive “Mary!”
It is her ma.
I see her round, red eye projecting
Where door and jamb are nigh connecting.
And now her pa
Comes dourly drifting in behind,
And sits and sniffs till all is blind.
AVe go upon the grassy hill.
Beneath the moon we’re not loquacious.
I hold her tightly. All is still.
Then some sly-comer hisses: “Gracious!”
It is her pa.
If prayer were granted as it flashes
He would be dust, and I’d be ashes.
And here is ma
With Mary’s wrap or Mary’s shawl.
She sits and supervises all.
AA'e seek some hidden harbor out,
That no intruding fool may Sever
Our kisses sweet. I banish doubt.
But comes a waspish: “Well, I never!”
It is her ma.
I shrink before indignant madam,
And know how good was God to Adam.
With pa and ma,
Omnipotence by no device
Could have constructed Paradise!

Melbourne Argus treats the Prime Min-
ister’s act in kissing Young Australia at
Bendigo as a mere joke. What the French
would call a Judas-spree, so to speak.
J. J. Cohen, M.L.A. for Petersham, is said
to be safe for the N. S. Wales Speakership.
If he does occupy the Chair he will be the
first Jew to do so. R. D. Meagher was the
first R.C.
Simon Hickey (ex-secretary) is the only
officer of the old N. S. Wales Labor party
who. will be a Labor member in the new
Parliament. Cann, deputy-leader, dropped
out; Morrish (treasurer) and Burgess
(whip) are defeated. Though “anti,” Hic-
key refused to make his fight on the dis-
honest conscription issue, and won well.
MAX MELD RUM.
Artist Meldrum is perhaps the most argu-
mentative man (for his inches) in Aus-
tralia. The fierce little creature takes as
his principal theme “Terruth in Art.” Mel-
drum would like to toss the old-fashioned
classical person out of the well and set up
in business in Melbourne as Truth himself.
Later on in this month Richard Teece,
actuary and general manager of the A.M.P.,
reaches the retiring age of 70 and hands
the reins over to 11. W. Apperley. He has
had a long innings on the box; 31 years ago
he was appointed secretary, and 27 years
ago actuary and general manager. There
hadn’t been a general manager until then.
Young “Dick,” a Maorilander by birth, was
the society’s first articled clerk. That was
in 1866. Nowadays it seems as if the
society has been going for ever; yet it had
paid out its first death claim —on the life of
one J. 11. Webb —only 14 years before .Teece
started to learn the business. But the life
insurance business wasn’t then what it is
now. It was thought necessary in those
days to advertise a list of respectable
“patrons”—Judges and such like —and even
then there was in many minds a suspicion
that it was irreligious if not actually blas-
phemous. Once, in the early days of the
society, Scotchbyterian parson Dr. Lang
was offered a fee of five guineas to deliver
a lecture on its advantages. He wanted the
money, but he turned down the offer “on
the ground that he disagreed with the prin-
ciple of providing for one’s family by life
insurance.
In a small usury case heard in Melbourne
defendant pleaded that after being taken
down by clients he had found it necessary
to charge 33 per cent, on small loans. Once
bitten twice Shylock.
Though he is close
up 70, “Dick” Lord is
the most sportsman-
like Mayor Slowbart
has had since the
whaling days. Forty
years ago he was
rivalled only by his
brother Winn for the
title of champion
cross-country rider of
Tassy. As a hunts-
man he remained in
the pigskin until re-
cent years and spent
a small fortune on a
pack of hounds. His
eldest son, Colonel
Lord, has a pack too.
They are known as
“The Fighting Forti-
eth,” and are just now
hunting Huns.
Bill Plain, M.L.A.

alishmaelite for the

task of importing his

LORD,
Mayor of Hobart.
It is no snap being Consul-General for
Russia these days. In Melbourne the local
Russians have been a good deal excited by
the revolution, and the other day a party
with a red flag started a. march to the Consu-
late to ask the Consul-General how his poli-
tical opinions stood. D’Abaza had left for
Adelaide on business. On top of that he
has had a cable from the Russian Embassy
in London telling him to assist “within the
limits of reasonable economy” Russian emi-
grants who came away for political reasons
and who want to go home, and, if necessary,
to raise a loan from a local bank to pay
“the passages of the returning exiles.” Now
he is looking for the local bank that wants
the business.
Hobart’s best-advertised fluff merchant,
G. I’. Fitzgerald, dropped out the other day,
aged 74. In the long ago he was a member
of the Speck’s Parliament and a Minister
under Philip Fysli, but after five years in the
House he missed election by 14 votes and
stayed out. He was a director of the defunct
V. D. L. Bank, and when the bank broke in
the early ’nineties he was more or less horse-
whipped by an infuriated lady who had lost
heavily by the smash, though probably not
one-quarter as heavily as “Fitz” had him-
self.
Dr. James Walter Smith, lately dead in
England, was a literary lawyer of the old
school who did Australia good service. He
was a Doctor of Laws (Oxford and London)
at 25, and 40 years ago he was both editor
and barrister in Natal. Then he had about
20 years in Adelaide, as Parliamentary
draftsman and inveterate journalist. About
the beginning of this century he moved on to
Perth, where for a time he was Commis-
sioner of Titles —but always writing. He
was well over 80 when he retired in 1914 to
spend his remaining years in Cornwall. His
“Twelve True Tales of the Law” is still good
humorous reading.
The father of just-dead T. J. Thompson,
one of the ancients of the Sydney Stock Ex-
. change, was a draper in King-street in the
first ’thirties. Thompson was No. IS; No.
3 7 was the little shop in which Anthony Hor-
dern and his wife —or perhaps Mrs. Anthony
Hordern and her husband—were laying the
foundations of Australia’s biggest depart-
ment store.
Next to Richard Teece, the general man-
ager of the A.M.P., who retires this month,
Alfred Meeks, the chairman of the Board, is
the oldest senior office-bearer in the big
society, lie has been a Head Office director
for 28 years.
David Davidson, the veteran secretary of
Wallaroo and Moonta mines (S.A.), retires
this month, at the age of 80. He is the
only sec. the present co. has had (Wallaroo
and Moonta amalgamated in 1890) and he
had be'en secretary of Wallaroo before that —-
from 1877. F. G. Murdoch, formerly of
Melbourne, succeeds him.
L. A. Jessop, proposing the toast of Parlia-
ment at the banquet in Adelaide to the visit-
ing Commerce men, told an old yarn of the
witness who was asked if he was or had been
M.P., and was advised by his counsel that
lie need not give any answer which would
incriminate himself. Jessop claims that this
actually happened in an Australian court in
1868. Which rather takes the point out of
his subsequent argument that modern
M’s.P. do not possess the dignity and the
respect accorded to their predecessors.
A queer but prized distinction is to be
conferred in Adelaide at Easter —“Provin-
cial Prior” of “the Order of Knights Tem-
plar.” Judge Boucaut held it for years,
and when he laid it down the late Chief
Justice Way did not disdain to add it to
his collection. Since his death it has been
vacant, and now the Duke of Connaught,
Grand Master of the Order, has decided to
hand it to C. G. Gurr, an elderly auctioneer
in Adelaide. So “knights” from at least four
States will get together and make Gurr a
“prior.” It is a queer world.
Passed out at Campsic (N.S.W.), John
Mclndoe, master mariner. Born at Paisley,
near Glasgow, 70 years ago, Mclndoe came
to Sydney as a boy and went to sea in the
“sixty milers” in the coal-trade between
Newcastle and Sydney. After getting his
ticket, he was for long master of the old-
time Civility ; and for the past 14 years he
had been on the bridge of the Kiama —South
Coast to Sydney.
Dr. Angas Johnson is founding a Histori-
cal Society in S. Aus. He himself belongs
to the historic house of George Fife Angas,
“founder” of S. Aus., and the blessing he
will give the new institution is bound to be
substantial.
Biographer Fred Johns (“Notable Aus-
tralians”) apparently doesn’t give himself
much rest from his strenuous official duties
at Adelaide Parliament House. “Who’s
Who” records that his recreations are “read-
ing, walking and writing biographies,” and
it is the last of the three that seemingly
monopolises his leisure, for having just fin-
ished a volume for publication in England
after the war (proceeds to Australian Sol-
diers’ Fund), Johns is hard at it preparing
material for two other books that ought to
be acceptable to Australians and add to his
biographical fame.
Tua Paruihi, a husky Maori who re-
ceived the Distinguished Conduct Medal at
Marton (M.L.) a week or so back, is a fight-
ing son of the old stock. Tua was cut off
ar>d surrounded by five Turks who wanted
to take him to Con-
stantinople by a quick
and easy route. But
Tua was busy. lie
stabbed one Abdul
with his bayonet,
cracked the skull of
another with his rifle
butt, smashed another
on the jaw with his
fist and downed him,
and prodded the fourth
in the stomach
with his toe.
The fifth man
was a sport and
took to Tua
with his fists.
This pleased the
Maori and after a
pleasant mill he led a
prisoner in with a
bleeding nose. “This
fella want te drink,”
said Tua; “me too.”
That’s what they gave
him the D.C.M. for.
The Bulletin adds
three cheers.

Opposition leader.
Hugh Mahon was one of Hughes’s col-
leagues in a couple of Ministries. “Mr.
Hughes now affects to clisclo.se,” he says,
“the number of the Anzac votes at the
referendum. As one intimately familiar
with the Prime Minister’s methods, I should
much prefer to accept the assurance of the
Chief Electoral Officer regarding the matter.”
As soon as the Coa£ition candidates for
the Senate were announced in Victoria, the
Argus got busy and published the alleged
portraits of the victims. George Fairbairn’s
was the worst, the print giving him almost
as close a resemblance to one of his own
wethers as to a human politician. In real
life Fairbairn is a
manly-looking sort
of person, with a
kindly eye and a
good, hard, com-
pact, honest coun-
tenance. Apart
from his mellow
political ideas, he
would really be a
fine figure of a
Senate candidate.
But the Senate
isn’t always elected
on its appearance.

“Minkil”: Concerning the pioneers of
moving-picture photography in Australia!
Almost 19 years ago E. J. Thwaites and R. W.
Ilarvie photographed the two Cups and Derby in
Melbourne, eacli film being shown at Rickards’s Tivoli
on the evening of the race. The work done by these
pioneers included the making of the camera; also
the apparatus used in cutting and perforating the
twenty-foot lengths of ordinary camera film. The
positives were made on the rapid negative film, never
meant for the purpose, and were printed to either
Lumiere or Edison standard-gauge from the one nega-
tive. A small “flip” book of the finish of the Cup
was also published and a penny a look was charged
in the back country within a few days of the race.
Thwaites invented and patented the Moveoscope, a
miniature instrument like the Mutoscope, which 1
believe it pre-dated. This was pioneering alongside
which the mechanical difficulties of modern work are
very few. Incidentally, Baker the younger, of
Watson and Sons, Melbourne, many years ago
described a method of kinemacolor. Such work was
only made possible, long after, by the great improve-
ment in the increased sensitizing to all colors of
the negative films.

THE NARROW PATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I was expelled from the Labor party because I
chose to tread the narrow path.”—W. M. Hughes.
Between the smiling duchesses and Bill —
Bill with the horny hand and horrid vote —
I lightly stepped, with my accustomed skill,
And called an Empire to observe and note
The fact that, moving in that narrow space,
I did not slack my tongue or change my pace.
The dancer on the high and swinging wire,
Above the gaping faces of the crowd
To such a feat as mine could ne’er aspire,
While right and left with dignity I bowed.
In fact, the dancer has a broad, plain road
Compared with that o'er which I boldly strode.
The German trembled as he saw me move
Where never Labor leader dared to tread.
The large remarks I made were meant to prove
The wondrous acrobatics of my head.
Between the Devil and the deepest sea
Are wider paths than those which oped for me.
I did not stumble. The resultant crash—
You could not fairly say it was a fall—
Occurred when I essayed my final dash
And found there was not any track at all.
The narrowness had simply petered out
On the last cadence of a splendid shout.
And now I merely go on hands and knees,
By any kind of road my steps are led;
The men who broke my fall I try to please
By letting five or six sit on my head.
And all my sorrow I devoutly trace
To walking boldly in so strait a place.
We may get somewhere. Votes are doubtful things.
But the large public loves its brother ass;
And the next poll perchance may give me wings
To soar—not walk—away, and lightly pass
To where the duchesses anil Empire wait
With crowns that still are green, though some-
what late.
"MISTER.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
M. Karensky, Minister for Justice, has abolished
the title of “Excellency.” Ministers are to be called
simply “Mister.” —Cable from, Petrograd.
Let’s talk of revolutions
And useful things like that,
Which knock old institutions
And ancient notions flat;
“Right Hons” and “Excellencies”
They (praise be!) sweep away,
And show that commonsense is
Once more to have its day.
Oh, empty is a title,
Hollow the purchased “Sir” !
No prefix yet was vital
To Mayor or Minister ;
And mighty Russia prizing
The man more than the rank.
Decrees (and bless its “rising”)
To do away with swank.
The country democratic—
We pride ourselves we’re one—■
Endorses with emphatic
Applause what Russia’s done.
Robes, rabbit-skin or ermine
For men are shoddy stuff;
No titles ! Let’s determine
Plain Mister’s good enough. *

Tlie policy-holder is concerned not with the
amount of profit which goes to the share-
holders, but with the amount which is left
for himself. If the four-fifths which lie gets
under the M.L.C.’s constitution is better
than the five-fifths which he would get under
another system, then obviously it pays him
to give up the one-fifth. The theory on
which the M.L.C. works is that people who
are directly interested in making profits are
more likely to make them than those who
are only very indirectly and remotely inter-
ested. This is the theory on which all
schemes of profit-sharing, co-operation and
co-partnership are based. In this case the
shareholders take the place of the workers;
the policy-holders are the employers.
The M.L.C. is certainly able to produce
some remarkable results in support of the
plan. A few years ago the Mutual Life
Association and the Widows’ Fund offices
came in under the roof of the Citizens’; and
the bonuses have been almost beyond com-
parison better than they were under the old
managements. This year the trustees of the
Widows’ Fund section report a bonus of 30s.
p.c. “This more than excellent rate of
bonus,” they say, “has been distributed for
six years in succession.” Incidentally, the
managing director having suggested that
policy-holders should forego a year’s bonuses
and authorise the payment of the money as
a gift to the nation for war purposes, the
trustees say:—
The splendid success of the union, evidenced by the
very large average increase in the bonuses allotted to
policies in the Widows’ Fund section, warrants us in
believing that policy-holders will not hesitate in their
decision to apply the cash value of their 1910 rever-
sionary bonus towards assisting the Empire in its
present conflict.
And the trustees who keep an eye on the
interests of the old M.L.A. policy-holders
“express their continued appreciation of the
skill and care with which the co.’s affairs
are managed ; and the soundness of the co-
operative principle on which the co.’s con-
stitution is based is, in their opinion, further
demonstrated.” What is known as the
M.L.C. section —that is, the section which
includes all old Citizens’ policies and all
policies issued since the union—gets a.bonus
distribution this year of £135.178. Add
£42,131 for M.L.A. and £43,254 for Widows’
Fund policies; total £220,563 cash profit for
the year to be divided among policy-holders,
equal to an average of 20 p.c. of the total
amount paid in premiums, including pre-
miums received during the year on new in-
surances. In the M.L.C. section alone the
percentage is higher. The claims paid during
the year totalled £539,145 in the Ordinary
and £66,491 in the Industrial branch; and of
that aggregate of £605,636 war claims
amounted to £78,874. Notwithstanding this
heavy war loss—most of it no doubt in
respect of young lives, which makes it much
more serious from an insurance point of
view—the bonuses are equal to those for
1014.
This very satisfactory result is all the
better when the investments are considered.
It would have been possible for the office
to have earned much additional interest by
investing the available funds in mortgages
and similar securities. But all the
co.’s available money has been put
into the War Loan. As at Decem-
ber. 1914, Government securities held
on behalf of both branches totalled
£2,614,603. On December, 1016. the hold-
ing was £5,185.050; and by 1 of the
present year the subscriptions to War Loans
had reached £4,600.000. As a matter of
fact, the office had subscribed for a bit more
than it could manage with its own money ;
and on December 31 it owed sundry credi-
tors £1,305,342, in addition to claims in
course of settlement (£140.067). This is
simply putting into practice a plan which
The Bulletin lately recommended for
general adoption. Between the Ordinary
and Industrial branches the M.L.C. can
depend upon accumulating over £525,000 a
year—it can be as sure of that for the next
few years as one can be Sure of anything.
That money as it comes in will call for per-
manent or semi-permanent investment. On
the other hand there are millions of money
in Australia which is not seeking permanent
investment. It is prepared, however, to
lock itself up for one, two or three years.
Plainly the M.L.C. is doing a great national
service by practically converting this money
into War Loan; and there are hundreds of
other institutions and people that could do
a similar service at this time of national
crisis.
The average rate of interest earned on
the funds during the year was £4 ISs. 7d.
p.c., as against £4 19s. Id. in 1915 and
£4 16s. Sd. in 1914. The shrinkage of 6d.
p.c. in the past 12 months is no doubt partly
due to tlu> investment of the money in War
Loan as mortgages, etc., have been paid off.
At the end of 1914 the total lent on mort-
gage was £4,165,349; it is now down to
£3,601,383. Two items—Government securi-
ties and loans to public bodies—represent
58 p.c. of all the assets; mortgages represent
30 p.c.; advances on policies, nearly 8 p.c.;
total of these three, 96 p.c. This leaves
only 4 p.c. for freeholds, including fore-
closures, and all other odds and ends. So
conservative is the valuation of assets that
furniture, fittings, stationery and such like
don’t appear as assets at all.

The M.L.C. offers to policy-holders in this
branch a straight-out contract. The policy-
holder knows exactly what he will get. and
payment is guaranteed by the capital of the
co. He is not lured with promises of bonuses.
If a policy-holder can afford to take an
Ordinary policy he should get out of the
Industrial branch at once. Industrial insur-
ance is the poorest sort of life insurance on
the market; and for that reason The Bul-
letin believes that no office which doesn’t
also offer Ordinary insurance should be per-
mitted to take Industrial. This office, while
making large profits out of Industrial, does
the decent thing, and oh every Industrial
policy directs attention to the superior
advantages of the other sort.

The profit for the year gets nearer to the
figure mentioned in the prospectus as hav-
ing been previously earned. But, taking all
the circumstances into account, it is still
not satisfactory. “War conditions” were
• blamed 12 months ago for “many .trading
difficulties”; but it is doubtful whether
there ever was a time when, on the whole,
softgoods profits were so large. Of the mil-
lions we are borrowing for war purposes
the draper is getting far more than his share ;
and, unfortunately, the greater part of it
goes out of the country. This co.’s stock
held and afloat reflects the state of the
trade. Two years ago the total, w'as
£214,205 ; twelve months ago £193,474 ; now
it is no less than £380,586. Shipments afloat
(£199.517) are alone valued at more than
the entire stock was, in warehouse and
afloat, 12 months ago. Prices are higher,
may be; but the extent of the buying is a
pretty good indication of a boom in the
purchase of fluff and millinery in Australia.
Meantime there is talk without end of
economy; and we have shut up the pubs
at six o’clock so that we shall not waste our
money. Yet from the national point of
view "it would be better to spend a million
on home-made beer than a hundred thousand
on foreign-made gewgaws. For the one wc
at least don’t have to send money or lOTJ’s
out of the country; for the other we do.
Such figures'as those quoted may be com-
forting to shareholders. From the national
point of view they are full of peril.
Along with the great increase in stocks
there has been a small growth of book-
debts : and the two items together now
amount to £512.178. That is big money for
a co. with a share capital of only £220,000.
The result, of course, is a heavy load of
liabilities. Twelve months ago the total
debt was £227,798; now it is £375,457. That
includes £lOO,OOO of. debentures. £41,841 of
deposits and £70,781 of overdraft. Apart
from the stock and book debts the principal
assets are freeholds and leaseholds £45.490.
and there is a mortgage of £33.000 on that
lot. The share capital is £lOO,OOO in 04
p.c. cumulative pref. shares, £70,000 in
ordinaries and £50,000 in deferred shares;
These deferred shares, issued in payment for
goodwill, have thus far drawn nothing, and
cannot draw anything till the ordinaries get
8 p.c. After the ordinaries have been satis-
fied the deferreds get whatever is available
up to 8 p.c.; then both lots stand in alike.
The pref. dividend takes £6500; the 8 p.c.
ordinary £5OOO. An 8 p.c. on the deferreds
would cost £4OOO. So there must be £lO,lOO
distributed before the ordinaries start to
get more than 8 p.c. The past year’s profit was
sufficient to pay all that and another 24 p.c.
The plan of purchasing goodwill with de-
ferred Shares has much to recommend it:
it shows, at any rate, that the vendors don’t
ask for payment unless the business was
well worth buying. In this case, in fact, it
would have been quite reasonable if they
had stipulated for a taste after the ordi-
naries’ capital had got a shade less than
8 p.c. No doubt the holders of these shares
are well represented on the Board; if so, it
is very creditable that they should stand
out of a dividend for the past year, seeing
that as much as £7577 was put by. And if
they don’t get it pretty soon they are not
likely to get it in a few years to come. For
the time is almost sure to arrive when we
shall be practising hard economy and talking
a lot less about it.

The Mines Department never says anything
about Wright Heaton’s gold-mine out West;
but the co. surely has one somewhere. Four
years ago the directors laid a cake worth
£21,000 on the table for the shareholders to
cut up, and now there is another of £14,195;
“inner reserves” they call it. Where these
pleasant surprises come from you couldn’t
find out even if you examined the accounts
with a small-tooth comb and a microscope.
Apparently the management provides for con-
tingencies which don’t arise ; and then it is
possible to transfer the no-longer-wanted pro-
vision to profit account. And it isn’t as
though the * country has been having un-
broken prosperity ’either. This co. and
McCulloch’s' (which"it owns) operate in X. S.
Wales and Victoria, and botli those States
have in parts had some shockingly bad times
in the'last seven years. That the co. has in
those circumstances been able to'avoid the
threatened contingencies Looks like uncom-
monly good management.
Including the inner reserves that have been
disclosed the co. in the past seven years
has made a profit of £89.310 in excess of the
10 p.c. dividends. Add to that £4OOO derived
from premiums on an issue of 4000 new
£2 10s. shares ; total, £93,310. This has been
disposed of as follows
Transferred to capital . . £20,000

Now the shareholders have had another lot of
10,000 shares (£2 10s - each) issued to them
as a reward for their good luck or sound
judgment, or something. What has been
done with all the profit made but not divided
in cash the next table shows: —

Much depends, no doubt, upon how the book
debts and stock are valued; but probably
shareholders’ minds are easy on that score.
There is certainly very good reason why they
'should be.

In comparing the profits of the past two
years with those of the years that went
before, note that previously something was
always written off against depreciation;
nowadays an unknown something is written
off before the profits are ’disclosed. In 'lns
and other ways the co. has an opportunity
of putting by something solid to meet contin-
gencies. How the trade in chemicals has
been affected by the war the following figures
suggest:—Jan., 1915, gross profits after de-
ducting net cost of manufacturing, £67,079;
1916, gross profits after deducting net cost
of manufacturing and depreciation on plant,
buildings and stock, £74.814; 1917, ditto,
£93,339. Against that has to be set “sal-
aries. travelling exes., interest, discount, in-
come and land taxes, bad debts and all
charges’’—l9ls, £43,635; 1916, £50,204;
1917, £67.777. It seems highly improbable
that salaries, travelling exes, and ordinary
ongoings have increased by anything like
£24,000 in two years; so probably a substan-
tial provision has been made for taxes, bad
debts and contingencies.
Partly, no doubt, because of enhanced
prices, the present stock is valued at nearly
£30,000 more than that held a year ago.
Here are the figures:—
1906. 1915. 1910. 1917.
Capital .. £200,000 £265,000 £265,000 £265,000

It is possible that, when the war ends,
chemical stocks, since they arrive in small
packages, will fall in value quicker than
most; and a lot therefore depends upon how
present stocks are valued. It is certain
that many wholesale people in this busi-
ness have made very large profits, especially
out of old stocks; and if this co. has had
that experience, it looks as though it has
used its surpluses to write down stocks and
thus provide for contingencies. Those con-
tingencies may not arise; if they don't, it
is highly probable that this co. will pre-
sently be able to bring substantial amounts
into profit.

A New Invention. —One of the most interesting
and useful of all exhibits to be seen at the coming
Easter Show will be an All-Steel Fence, designed and
made in Australia by the Rawson, Moody Mfg. Co.,
343 Kent Street, Sydney. This new fence, which is
built with powerful steel posts and wire, saves 80 per
cent, in labor, weighs only one-fifth the weight, and
will last a lifetime, as compared with the present-
day method of wooden fences, that decay so quickly.
All interested in fencing should see this fence, as it
will save money; it costs only 12s. Od. to 15s. per
chain complete. If not going to the Show, a fence
is on view at the above address, or an illustrated
catalogue will be sent on request.— Advt.

divided balance of the past year’s profit has
been transferred to a “Reserve of Accumu-
lated Profit” account., from which £136,000
has been transferred to a “Taxation Re-
serve” account “and invested as a provision
against Federal and war-time profits taxa-
tion.” In the 1915 accounts Federal as well
as other taxation for that year was esti-
mated and charged against revenue, but no
charge has been made against the past year's
revenue in respect of Federal taxation for
1916. As there certainly will be heavy
Federal taxes, though the amount is not
yet known, the £331,505 isn’t the true profit.
It has to be diminished by the amount of
the Federal tax, whatever it may be. On
the other hand, probably no great amount
will be received by way of surpluses, because
tlie co. knew quite well what it was going
to receive for the copper on hand on Decem-
ber 31. It had some private contracts to
fulfil; but the British Munitions Depart-
ment had taken all the excess. Apparently
this British Munitions contract wasn’t any-
thing to make the co. hilarious about. At
any rate, whereas the price to the Depart-
ment was £lOO, the average price realised
during the year was £ll3 3s. The average
price of standard copper during the year was
£ll6 Is. 3d. For the pre-war period of
1914 the average was £6l 11s. lOd. There
is another way of putting it. Because the
Berman influence was so strong in the
highest places in England, Britain allowed
Germany to prepare for war while making
hardly any preparations herself; wherefore
the German got all tin' stoves of foreign cop-
per he thought he would need at £6l per
ton, while Britain has had to pay £ll6. For
the current year’s production in excess of
private contract requirements, the British
Munitions Department will pay the co.
£ll6 13s. 4d. f.o.b. Sydney.
During the year the old Wallaroo and
Moonta Co. has paid away £120,000 in divs.;
and after deducting £136,000 for war-profits
taxation and paying * away about £15,000
for special additions to plant, etc., it has
now £250,851 of liquid and semi-liquid assets
in excess of liabilities, as against £280,892
12 months ago. If costs had kept to the
old level the improvement in the position
would have been, vastly better than that.

General-manager Hancock’s apology runs as
follows
Owing to war conditions great difficulties are being
experienced in obtaining the stores and materials
required. The higher prices paid in this direction,
together with the additional bonuses to employees,
and the fact that lower-grade vein stuff has been
handled, is reflected in the increased cost of produc-
tion.
Though, as usual, nothing is said about ore
reserves, the g.-m. is rather more talkative
than usual. They took out 6035 tons of
copper from underground in the 12 months,
“and an equivalent supply was made avail-
able in the new ground opened.” Also: —
At Moonta mines during the last 4-1 years explora-
tory work at Taylor’s West lode, including the 1200
and 1440 feet levels, brought within the range
of profitable mining an estimated quantity of between
3000 and 4000 tons of copper ; but the most recent
explorations in the deeper levels have not been
encouraging. The purchase of the Ilamley leases in
May last, however, may be expected to provide con-
siderable quantities of payable material, as develop-
ment work at the Karkarilla end offers favorable
prospects, although the vein stuff is of comparatively
low grade.
At one time metallurgists held “Munta”
pretty cheap and had an idea that the old
concern depended mostly upon prayer and
fasting. But most of them to-day have as
much to learn from Wallaroo and Moonta
as Wallaroo and Moonta has to learn from
them. This is no ore to be fed into furnaces
direct: Moonta’s average last year was
2.69 p.c. and the average of all the mines
only 3.05. In the preliminary dressing pro-
cesses the recovery, though poorer last year
than in 1915, was 92J p.c. of the contents.
The tailings containing the other 71 p.c. go
on either underground for filling or for
leaching by the simple cementation process,
which recovers the metal’at a cost probably
of £3O per ton —it was much less once.
If. the modern business man were offered
a policy like those that were issued in the
days, 51 years ago, when Richard Teeee be-
came an articled clerk to the A.M.P. Society,
there would be some gasping. The contract
included provisions like tlie following:—
This policy is upon express condition that if the
said So-and-so shall be killed in battle, or shall go
on the sea, unless passing direct from one part of
X. S. Wales to another, in a vessel exceeding 5,0
tons burthen; or if the said So-and-so shall die by
his own hands, or by duelling, or by' the hands of
justice, or from casualty by collision with the
aboriginal natives of any part of New Holland, or in
consequence of injuries sustained in such collision,
this policy shall be void, and the moneys paid on
account of this assurance shall be absolutely for-
feited to the society.
And even if the proponent made a practice
of “going on the sea,” even between “one
part of X. S. Wales and another,” he was
liable to be turned down, as the captain of
the Eliza found. The perils of the passage
between Sydney and Newcastle were much
too serious to be covered. Incidentally we
get an early view of the Fog-born notion that
a hot country must be unhealthy in the
society's rule that residents in Queensland
must pay an extra premium. It was that
really great man, M. A. Black, the actuary
from ISOS onwards, who knocked out most
of that nonsense.
Great Cobar is still battling along in a
don’t-care style with one eye on a furnace
which is running half-heartedly and the
other watching for the bailiff. Difficulty is
being experienced in obtaining sufficient
basic ore to flux the silicious ores, and
rumors of closing down are flying around.
So persistent were they that the local press
interviewed Hogan Taylor and asked if
it was a fact that the mine was to close if
the miners refused to work night shift, lie
declined to discuss the matter. At any rate the
Chesney mine has been allowed to fill and
Cobar Gold Mine is not run seriously. Clos-
ing the Chesney knocks out in one swipe
over half a million tons of Pellew Harvey’s
reserve ores. Scrap-iron and machinery
agents have been lately buying up sundries
from one or other of Great Cobar properties.
It reminds one of crows hovering round a
dying sheep.
The C.S.A., near Cobar, is delayed by a
strike. The mine has been raising from
4000 to 5000 tons of ore in 12 months, and a
fairly large proportion has been rich enough
to send to custom smelters. The develop-
ment of very large quantities of basic ore
in the lower levels prompted the directors
to instal a blast furnace with blowers,
electric light and water services. Being
connected by rail, this mine is starting under
favorable conditions, and the work done
underground during the past two years has
proved very large ore reserves estimated
more! than 12 months since at 200,000 tons.
The C.S.A. isn’t, however, a purely basic
proposition, for there are large quantities
of silicious ore, and enrichments occur in all
the levels; so the usual problem is sticking
out —how to handle large quantities of com-
plex ore to the best advantage. For a start,
at any rate, it is intended to produce matte
for treatment at other works, in this follow-
ing the example of Nymagee, Tottenham
and Great Cobar in its youth.

More than nine-tenths of Associated
Northern’s revenue for last year came from
the Victorious and neighboring Gimlet leases
at Ora Banda (W.A.), and the remainder
was principally royalties derived from tri-
bute parties on the almost worked-out Iron
Duke lease at Kalgoorlie. Operations on the
eo.’s Mexican venture have been suspended
since the end of 1914, and nobody seems
to know wlmt has or is happening there.
As nothing of value has been exposed at
depth in the Victorious leases, all that now
remains to be done is to extract the ore in
sight. As regards the Gimlet group, in
which some promising developments have
lately been reported, the manager states
that, owing to the stringency of the financial
position, operations have not been as exten-
sive as desired. This year the huge Belgian,
Pierre Ledoux, who represented some Brus-
sels interests on the Board, retires by rota-
tion ; but as nothing has been heard of him
since shortly after the outbreak of the war,
it is not proposed to fill the vacancy.
The future of Lake View and Star (W.A.)
hangs by a slender thread owing to poorer
ore and dearer stores. Operations for the
past 16 months have shown a loss due to costs
having risen from ISs. to 225. per ton. The
management is honing that the tide will turn
before long r if it doesn’t the co. will have to
call in the undertaker.
Some TJ.S.A. speculators have lately had
a man looking at low-grade shows at Yilgarn
(W.A.). There are ’denty there; and Uncle
Sam is welcome to have a go at them.
* * * *
Leonora Blocks has commenced treatment
operations on ore from its 36-inch-wide reef,
and in anticipation shares have climbed to
ten shillings. Those who sell the stock at
this figure will probably not be sorry.
Kalgoorlie miners’ complaint about in-
ferior dynamite has elicited a reply from the
Minister that the inferiority is due solely to
the war, and that great difficulty is being
experienced in getting any explosives at all.
The grade fixed by the Imperial Government
is four-fifths of 50 p.e. gelignite and one-fifth
gelatine-dynamite, and the Minister for
Munitions has refused to allow any other
explosive to be exported. The experience of
Westralian mines, particularly those at Kal-
goorlie, is that in blasting a much higher
strength of nitro-glycerine is required in
development work than in the case of ore-
breaking after development openings have
been made. Tests show that the best ex-
plosives to use in Westralian mines are those
consisting of gelignite only, four-fifths con-
taining 50 p.c. of nitro-glycerine and one-
fifth containing G 1.4 p.c. of nitro-glycerine.
The British authorities were informed of
this fact; but they know best.

The first the list are brokers. The
1.0. A. is tlie Insurance Office of Australia;
and some people will wonder what it’s doing
there. The rest include a squatter, a but-
cher, a maltster, a mining sec., half a dozen
brokers, and —last on the list—the first of
the American mining and smelting men im-
ported for Broken Hill. Uncle Sam never
sent another so good.
Three months’ work will settle whether the
Duke gutter, Maryborough (Vic.), split in
two in the Duke Extended claim, to junction on
the Duke Consols boundary. When John Bull
bought the Duke United, Sam Body opened
up payable drift to well beyond the main
shaft. Then a big crab-liole cut out the gold
and gave room for the belief that the gutter
had swung away to the north-east across the
combs of the slates, where Binder and Pitt
spent J. Bull’s good cash trying to find a
payable patch. The Duke Extended took on
the same job when Bull went out, but all it
has done is to chuck in £31,500 of calls to
get out £37,000 of gold. Bull wasn’t such a
fool as he looked when he slid out of the
field. The latest effort of the Extended is to
shove out a drive of SOOft. to give the western
ground its chance. Out of two or three bores
only one has proved wash, and the dip of
the country so far doesn’t hint that a deep
gutter is ahead. Why the co. couldn’t have
prospected by sinking a few closely-placed
surface bores The Bulletin doesn’t know.
The most that L. Hansen can do at Ajax
North, Daylesford (Vic.), just now is to look
pleasant because he is dodging calls. Costs
run out at 20s. 6d., and as the stone averages
barely 245. it is no wonder that he sighs for
a fresh shoot. Over 25 p.c. of his costs go
in grubbing about for gold, because in Day-
lesford, once you hang back in the hunt after
fiat makes or verticals, the flag has soon to
go half-mast. Hansen s big disappointment
has been the pinching of the shoot in the
stopes at No. G, for a run of 7dwt. dirt there
would have meant all the difference. As it is,
he is forced to belt away on a Gft. reef at No.
9 level which, if good-looking, is poor stuff.
A feeler is going out at No. 7 level after the
stone from which Ajax Central has been
making profits of late. Hansen says the shoot
is about SOft. away, but some of the Cen-
tral crowd who love not the North stick out
for 250 ft. I-low these Daylesford Johnnies
love one another, to be sure!
* ♦ ♦ *
There isn’t much to deserve a halo in J. W.
Carroll’s report on the doings at Lyell Blocks
during the last few months. Zealots have
turned a sick green to learn from him that
the ore got at 432 ft. in the 1200 ft. drive
north can’t claim kinship with the rich bor-
nite being worked just inside the North Lyell
ground. As Carroll came to that opinion on
March 10, what Tiie Bulletin wants to
know is just where the news got bushed on
its way to the Stock Exchange. Carroll
drove at 1200 ft. through ore from 423 ft. to
451 ft., but then plumped into misfortune in
the shape of practically barren schist. Now
he is going after the ore in a rise from the
1300 ft. Ore may be overhead too, but it
isn’t necessarily the £4O bornite the North
Lyell staff is gouging out on the boundary.
Looking at things all round the odds are still
against the Blocks.
The Jupiter mine, a lease of 124 acres
lying next door to the Read-Rosebery prop-
erty, and supposed to contain the same sort
of refractory zinciferous ores, has been taken
over by a co. which proposes to furnish the
raw material for J. H. Gillies to exercise his
extraction process on at the North-West Bay
(Tas.) works.
* * *
Guano Fertilisers, Ltd., a Sydney co
which recently purchased the plant and
lease of the Mount Etna Caves, 16 miles
north of Rockhampton (Q.), for the purpose
of working the guano deposits therein, is
moving things along. There are over 40 of
these caves aud iu some the guano is 20 feet
deep. The stuff is hauled from chamber to
chamber by skips, and hoisted through a
shaft to an opening in the mountain side.
From there it slithers along an aerial wire
to a mill, where it is reduced to powder. The
railway is only about a mile away, and as
orders are reported to be flowing in from
Maoriland and X. S. Wales, there is no
visible reason why the enterprise should not
be successful, provided a fairly uniform
article can be supplied. That has always
been the trouble hitherto.

A WAMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, April 2, 1917.
My Dear Arini, —
The G.-G. Fairgusons, with sonsy Lady
Doris Blackwood, are over the border. They
broke the fall at the Onslows’ roomy home-
stead at Camden. His Ex. hurried on ahead,
after a look at the Menangle military camp,
to have a ci’ack wi’ a brither Scot, James
Burns, at Gowan Brae. Meanwhile the
Comforts Fund dames are after the vice-regal
Presence for their tea tents at the Show.
, Haskett Smith, A.D.C., not well enough
to face the Hun again, is still behind
the G.-G.’s chair. Kerr-Pearse, who has not
yet sniffed the smoke of battle —he married
a cousin of Lady Edeline —is now military
sec. A merely-private sec. is Francis
Harman, not well known here.
Kate Rooney was captured by her native
sun-baked Dubbo for a concert in its Empire
Hall. The contralto stipulated that the
affair should be in aid of the local hospital,
in which Kate has always felt more than
ordinary interest, because one of her gran’-
mas was its first matron. The programme
almost shouted the singer’s career and men-
tioned everything from Covent Garden Opera
House to a Glasgow Gaelic festival. Kate
chose, for one item, Delilah’s siren song,
“Softly Awakes My Heart.” The Dubbo
printer called the gentleman in the case
Sampson, but that didn’t interfere with the
applause.
The once-grim ’Varsity Senate is shaking
off old traditions. It no longer merely toler-
ates but now actually encourages Woman
to sop up medicine and science under the
best conditions. Hence the new ladies’
menagerie, Manning House. Called after the
tall, courtly old Chancellor, whose summing
up against the defendant students at the
annual commem. in the long ago was a mild,
interminable monologue, it is a non-residen-
tial club. The ’Varsity Women’s Union is
the Missus. The Senate opened its purse
strings and supplied the bricks and mortar,
and the finished article was opened the other
day within the sacred precincts of Sydney
Uni.’s park-like grounds. Vice-president Dr.
Constance D’Arcy seems to be the main-
spring of the machine.
The versatile Judge Backhouse, who dab-
bles lightly in all the arts, took the chair at
the first prize-gift corroboree in the Conser-
vatorium. Verbrugghen, a slender silhouette
tossing a mane of coal-black hair, touched
on the first year’s progress and threatened
stiffer exams, in the years to come. Nothing
daunted (though it may have given the
youngsters a squirmy feeling inside), stu-
dents finished the affair with scrape of fiddle
and a song or two.
Mrs. Wilfrid Docker, whose sudden death
shocked Red Cross and Empire League
circles last week, was one of two prettv
Lord sisters who married two DocL*r
brothers —.Wilfrid and Arthur—away back
in the ’seventies. Simon Lord, who started
the first tanneries out at Botany early
last century, was the Australian founder of
the family, and left it pretty well furnished
with cash which has long since lost the
smell of the tanpits. Mrs. Arthur died
about 20 years back, leaving three daughters,
now married in England, and two sons—
one killed two years ago in Flanders as
major of artillery, and the other an Angli-
can rector in Adelaide. Arthur married
as his second wife a sister of Carr Smith,
the big, bearded democratic parson who put
new life into Sydney old St. James’s. For
some years past they have lived at Gran-
tham, in Lincolnshire, where Carr now cir-
culates a collection plate in a tabernacle
which has the tallest steeple in Fogland. Ada
Lord, who became Mrs. Wilfrid, spent all
her married life in Darlinghurst, a couple
of doors from the old family home, turned
into a private hospital since her mother’s
death 12 years ago. Hubby, an accountant
and auditor of tonnage, keeps the key of the
cash-box for the Red Cross and several
dozen other societies, mostly concerned with
Anglican charities; and his wife, who was
childless, was on the committee of nearly
all of them, besides running most of the
social and charitable activities of St. John’s,
opposite her front door in Darlinghurst.
Niece Winifred, eldest daughter of the Judge,
after three years’ absence in the Cold Coun-
try. reached home the day after her aunts
funeral.
Any rabbits to give away ? April 4 is
Bunny Day. Every tail goes to the Bed
Cross larder for sick and wounded soldiers.
Decently cooked, bunny is next o kin to
chicken and only the rabidly-inquisitive ever
examine the boues of a feast.
In Thrift Week the show window in
Challis House had a mixed and mottled col-
lection of fruits of the earth. A meek sample
or two of home-made cakes were much like
any other cakes. But if the quince with a
bruise on its cheek and a few similarly in-
valided vegetables stood for Thrift they were
not exhilarating invitations to reform.
Prof. Irvine threw a pellet _ at the rash
advice of the over-thrifty during the past
week’s attack on the money-spenders. True
economy, he said, means organisation. To
chop down expenses all round till the unem-
ployed list began to swell was a false
economy which would hit the people who
tried it. One lady-speaker quoted a femi-
nine prodigy who half-soled her own boots.
But, thank' goodness, experts in economics
don’t urge us all to do the cobblers out of
their job.
The Thrift campaigners could only catch
the public through reports of their sayings in
the press. Even 11. Y. Braddon, on the final
evening, had to face a garrison of empty
chairs in the King’s Hall. He called to
the faithful few to come nearer —which they
did—before launching his little bark of facts
and figures. Man, a careless animal in
some respects, with his pockets full of loose
change, isn’t looking to the Thrifters to re-
form his habits. So he stayed away.
Three or four of his kind made, the male
contribution to Friday niedit’s audience. Of
the women, most <sf those present looked
as if they knew everything that there is to
know of the art of making a shilling buy
eighteeen-penn’orth.
The tall, good-looking Mrs. Scott Fletcher,
lately of Brisbane, gave a gentle push to
the meetings. She is the wife of. that
Methody parson who is Principal-Designate
of the new college within the Uni. It is
so new that it won’t be finished till August
or thereabouts. Meanwhile he keeps his
eye on students-to-come, and dreams dreams
of the great things that are to happen after
the war. For the present they camp at Bee-
croft.
The War Chest f§te at Chief Justice
Cullen’s Mosman home happens on April
28. Hon. sec. B. H. Bundock writes of a
dazzling list of attractions, competitions, etc.,
that will charm the Youth and Beauty with
£ s. d. to the show! Mrs. Esmond Friend,
Mrs. Ross Nott, Mrs. Maclaurin and Mrs.
W. J. White are amongst the dames who
offer prizes for such events as the sweetest
thing in a baby’s bonnet. Any girl who
thinks she makes the best sweets in her sub-
urb can now prove it by stepping out for
Mrs. Priddle’s prize money. Entries must
be sent to the War Chest Depot, 68 Eliza-
heth-street, by April 26.
After 18 months on active service, Dr.
Herschell Harris contrived to efface his own
efforts—he is the radium expert —at his
recent lecture to the Red Cross. He chanced
to be in England when Wilhelm ran amok,
and went to France with the first lot of
Australian doctors and nurses. They, too,
were merely sight-seeing when the unex-
pected happened. Later to Lemnos, and
then to Gallipoli.
The modest little man’s cheery grin can be
picked out in a front-trench picture taken at
Gallipoli, 12 yards from the front Turkish
line; in another snapped on the rocks at
Lemnos, in the days when the R.A.M.C.
took it in turn to shelter for five minutes
from a burning sun under the only bit of
tarpaulin; in others taken in the French
war zone. But the photos taken by
Herschell Harris he prizes more than those
of him. They are amongst the best records
of the Gallipoli adventure, and they thrilled
the audience to vociferous applause.
The Red Cross will not let the Easter
bun go by without struggling to get a few
crumbs. Hence a lantern-slide demonstra-
tion, followed by the usual musical snacks,
on April 10, at the Tojvn Hall.
The man who is paid to count the sprays'
of orange-blossom and wreaths of cypress
for N. S. Wales reports that there were 9009
weddings in 1916, which works out at 11
pretty brides and the same number of hand-
some bridegrooms per 1000 present-givers.
It is the slowest Wedding March since 1910,
and 8 per cent, below the average of the
previous five years. But what a rush to the
parson there’ll be when the boys come home
—the loyal ones that haven’t acquired Eng-
lish brides! I expect Peace to arrive in
Australia in a spring dray loaded with orange
blossom.
A recent art event was the placing of an
allegorical group in bronze on the Water
and Sewerage Board’s new building in Pitt-
street while an anxious sculptor stood and
waved his hands. Aquaria, Hygeia and the
City of Sydney are the three ladies con-
cerned. and Aquaria is doing the pouring
out. But I think it was a bit mean not to
give Luck a place. She’s the lady who has
more than once saved the Board from having
to issue to the citizens instructions in the
art of dryblowing.
St. Vincent’s Hospital committee chats of
putting on another storey as lightly as you’d
talk of buying a new hat. It's to be dedi-
cated to the memory of our fallen soldiers.
At a week’s carnival to raise the wind,
beginning April 10, Rabbi Cohen will have
one of the tents. What he’s going to sell
isn't mentioned yet; but the business won’t
languish for lack of a push. Mrs. Kenna,
Mrs. Herbert Kendall and Mrs. Howse are
joint hon. secs.
F. J. Sherwin, a familiar figure in
Paling’s, where he was a director and man-
ager of the music department, passed out
last week. A long bout of ill health, with
a bad chill to start the trouble, was the
cause.
One day last week Marjorie Earp. daugh-
ter of George, M.L.C., walked blithely up
the aisle on father’s arm, while Leslie Cur-
now waited with the ring. The bridal
plumage was short —in moderation —-and bil-
lowed with white tulle flecked with silver
lace. Orange blooms trailed round the girl’s
fair hair, which was shrouded in the u«unl
misty veil. Bridesmaidens Dora and Lilian
Earp and Rhoda Curnow, all in festive
French white frocks, tossed long black vel-
vet streamers on the'r sum mere miiunery.
The ’groom was in the first rush to the
Front, and came back wounded and incapaci-
tated for further service. Now he is helping
to count the cash in the Commonwealth
Bank. Not displayed amongst the glittering
wedding presents was Dad’s gift to his
daughter—a generous helping of shares in
his business. After the ’moon the turtle-
doves will coo in a creeper-covered cottage
in the erounds of St. Mervyn’s. with the
Earp chalet at the other end of the garden.
Mrs. Joe Bradley’s snowy coiffure (it is
cut short like a school-kid’s) bent over the
Oueen Victoria Chib teacups the other day.
In a musical interlude Brenda Deloitte, Mar-
garet Chalmers and Philip Wilson swelled
the joyful noises.
Have you seen what the more frisky Syd-
ney damsels bring back from the FogV They
don’t catch it there, but get the germ by
proxy or when they bolt for home and sun-
shine across the TJ.S.A. It’s the awful
Buster Brown coiffure—hair chopped off
short, just below the nape of the neck, and
bumped up like a Cruikshank caricature of
Chadband’s locks. Saw one of the recently
returned Buster maidens at the theatre the
other night. An inch or two of corsage on
a (mercifully) lean frame. The skirt just
below the knees, and the Buster wisp of hair
cut in a straight fringe across the forehead.
A vacant expression—supposed to represent
the infant Buster’s wide-eyed stare—goes
with this freak hairdressing. There are
some fools that even a great war can’t scratch
sense into.
St. Martha, troubled about many things,
and chiefly about the orphan, holds a carni-
val for the Home at Leichhardt on April
28. The local mayor heads a committee;
and W. Bramley-Voung, Walker Avenue,
Ilaberfield, will give you any further details
you want.'
After seven weeks in London without a
w T an glimpse of even a watery English winter
sun, H. N. Southwell thought of looking for
the lost orb in Spain. But the most desper-
ate search of a way-out failed. The neces-
sary passport was the most elusive bit of
paper the Australian had ever sought. So
he tried to be an incurable optimist again,
and pretended that a London drizzle was
merely a morning mist on Sydney Harbor.
Andrew Higginson retains the figure he
used to twirl so lightly in musical comedy.
Why the elegant heroes of light opera should
so often gravitate to ’otel-lceeping is not ex-
plained in any of the Books of the Prophets.
But, whatever the reason, very few come
back to the footlights with their waistlines
as carefully preserved as Higginson’s. Still,
the gallery girl no longer sighs; the glamor
was left behind the bar.
The Presswomen will have about £l2O in
hand when all their financial chickens come
home to roost. This isn’t bad for a show
that set too low a value on its goods. A
soldier’s home will be furnished with the
money.
After all, Newcastle isn’t going to lose the
magnificent area of wild flora I told you about
some time ago. According to the Northern
Times, Donald Pannikin Fraser brought the
wastage under the notice of Minister for
Lands Ashford; and now this Nature’s
garden has been earmarked for .all pos-
terity. There is in the new reserve
one block of 440 acres and another of 890
acres, both sprawling south of Catherine
Hill Bay. When the railway line opens
some day to this paradise the public will
have the enjoyment of it. One block is
washed by the blue Pacific, with Lake Mun-
mirah as another boundary. It has been
saved in the nick of time, for the flower-
sellers were in the "way of exterminating
acres of flannel flowers.
The Russian musicians Mirovitch and
Piastro have successfully cleaned up the
Indian circuit and got a column or so of
melted butter from the Calcutta Statesman.
Both the fiddler and the pianist are amongst
the best of their kind (the Paderewski-
Ivubelik class excepted), and Sydney will be
glad to hear them again. The huge Emile
Bucker now has them for a Dutch-Indies
tour of 50 concerts. After Java the duo
come here on the way to Maoriland.
The city is as chock-a-block as a tin of
freshly-packed sardines. Dreadful cries of
hard times ahead couldn’t keep Grass-seed
and his missus from the Easter Show. Hotels
are bulging to the fire escapes, and the last-
minute visitor who hopes for a shake-down
this week will have to chase the sparrows
off the roof-tops.
The Voluntary Workers’ Cafe in Moore-
street is still making decent profits for the
cause. Out of its till it lately took the
necessary cash to provide materals for a
returned soldiers’ cot at French’s Forest, and
Eveleigh Workshops supplied the voluntary
labor to put the place together. Mrs.
Greatrex —one of the daring spirits who
started the bun- and tea-shop—turned the key
in the door of the new abode.
The Macleod girls’ evening party in aid
of the 17th Battalion Comforts Fund was
brilliantly illuminated with garlands of elec-
tric bulbs. Fair Luua (as Rod Quinn would
say) wasn’t much larger than a baby sickle,
and didn’t confuse the earthly mechanic’s
job. Travellers up Mosman Bay likened the
scene to Naples without the macaroni and
the smells. Bowls on a green velvet lawn,
a shooting-gallery, Hop’s talk-and-chalk
under a canopy of gum-leaves, games at
which you might pocket all the profits
(though the odds were on the 17th Batta-
lion) and fortune-tellers in mystic bowers,
kept the company on the move. The fund
will be about £7O the richer.
The Australian Air Squadron’s Fund has
achieved a thrilling leaflet. The air looks
like a hornets’ nest on the wing, and the
earth is thick with friends, enemies and
armored tanks all popping at the world in
general. Between August, 1916, and Feb-
ruary, 1917, Australia gave 13 battleplanes,
12 from N. S. Wales (three cheers!) and
one from S. Australia, to the British War
Office. Eleven of these have already been
in action. Send along a copper or two to
pav for the more that are needed in the
great fight. Hon. treas. F. E. Bryant,
Union Bank, Sydney.
The Albert Gould lady took the head of
the table at the N.S.W. Women’s Battle-
plane meeting. Mrs. Tom Watson, hon. sec.,
mentions the acute need for about £BOO to
finish the bird. The rest of the £2760 is in
hand.
Bushranging under a brilliant electric
light will at least have the attraction of
novelty. This item is amongst the Show
events to tickle the fancy of lads and lasses
who don’t care for pigs and poultry raw.
The Domain Anzac Buffet broke out in a
tin-can evening. It was the usual raid for
stock to fill the Buffet’s tent at the Show'.
Three hundred tins of everything from potted
mustard to bullock’s tongue came along with
a stampede of visitors. You got in by show-
ing your tinned heart or whatever your bag-
gage might be. Sailor Cole, with a bulldog
mascot belonging to H.M.A.S. Snapper, made
an eminently successful appearance—the
bluejacket in song, and his four-legged pal
(who has been in action several times in
this war) as a walking gentleman. Eileen
Mullen (pupil of Goossens), Mrs. Pearson
and other Buffet friends kept the music
going.
The sth Field Artillery had an afternoon
shivoo at the depot in Carrington-street,
Mrs. Minter (hon. sec.) and Mrs. Sheridan
(hon. organiser) rounded up stragglers for
the event. As a cold fact, the Comforts
Funds are now, one and all, out for your
last farthing.
An average of 283 families get fruit and
vegetables every week from the Red Cross
depot in Ash-street. Steady streams of the
dependants of sick, wounded and _ missing
soldiers struggle out of this pumpkin patch
with bags full of solid comfort. A Killara
V.A.D. commandant, Edie Fisher, and
another joint in the Red Cross tail, Miss
Fitzhardinge, take the names and needs of
a rapidly-growing list of gratis customers.
Any cabbages, any parsnips? Send them
in!
The 1917 fur coats are beginning to walk
about with a lady inside—already, in spite
of their polar-bear exterior. Yes, just as
full and short as the 1916 samples.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

IS THIS DISTINCTION
PLAIN TO YOU—=?
A Melbourne lady recently wrote to a friend in Sydney:—
“I have finally decided to buy a Pianola. But what is troubling
me is which Pianola to buy. 1 wonder if you can help me decide
The mistake this lady made is not unusual. It is just as though
she had said, “I have finally decided to visit London. But there
are so many different Londons in the world I can’t decide which to
see.”
Of course the one London which is famous is London.
England. And it is just as true that the instrument most people
have in mind when they say “Pianola” is the one made by the
Pianola Company—the only genuine Pianola.
THERE IS BUT ONE PIANOLA—
It is made only by The Pianola Company
The success and wide-spread acceptance of the Pianola has led
the press and others to use its name as a term for all player-pianos.
The chief sufferer from this confusion is the purchaser, who,
supposing he is buying the famous Pianola, secures instead merely
an ordinary player-piano.
Before buying you should understand that the Pianola was the
first player-piano. That it is an exclusive product of The Pianola
Company—the largest manufacturers of musical instruments in
the world.
That its sales exceed the sales of any of its imitators. That
it has been exclusively endorsed by practically every musical
authority of the present day.
And that it is the only player-piano which enables the
untrained performer to duplicate the playing of a skilled pianist.
The celebrated Pianola line embraces the five finest pianos in
the world at their respective prices, all containing the genuine
Pianola-action.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, April 2, 1917.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The graceful shirkers are being Aveeded
out like fact’ry ’ands at Federal Government
House. They have a roll call at 10 o’clock
every morning, and the .slit-workers of the
Red Cross who are not there to ans Aver
“Present” are marked absent for the day.
This foils the fluffy drones who make a great
noise about the work they do for "dear
Lady Helen” and then turn up to toil at
11.30, knocking off punctually at midday.
The G.-G., who Avas accompanied by Lady
Helen, lisped his appreciation of Ililder’s art
in opening the Ililder Memorial Exhibition
at the iioav Fine Art Galleries on Monday
afternoon. There Avas a throng of art-lovers,
which included Henry Gyles Turner, Jack
McNally, Freda Sternberg, EdAvard Dyson
(proudly flaunting his brand-new moustache)
and others. Marie Tempest Avas piloted round
by Tommy Cochran, and elocuted her
approval of the affair. The 128 panels in-
clude some of poor Hilder’s best Avork.
Lieut. Fred, the Norton Grimwade's’ son,
who was winged in mid-air and brought to
earth a prisoner, has been given his liberty,
by the Huns, lie Avas sorely injured, one
fears.
Whole battalions of Mrs. Edwin Tivey's
friends are rolling up in close formation to
congratulate her. Husband “Ted” led
the way into Bapauine at the head of his
brigade, and some of his devoted men gave
up hard-earned leave in order to be with him.
Mrs. Officer (once Miss Umphelby) has
just Avaved good-byes to son Hugh, Avho has
bolted from the Grammar School to the war.
II is elder brother, who left as private, is
now a lieutenant, M.G. It’s enough to fire
any young brother.
Memories of a former Senate election,
when the Argus ran the Comic Four, in-
cluding the late John Mclntyre, are recalled
by the news of the death of the old
boy’s grandson, Temporary-Captain John
Mclntyre, of the Trench Mortars. He
joined the 28tli (W.A.) Battalion as a pri-
vate in March, 3915, Avas made regimental
sergeant-major in Gallipoli, avus commis-
sioned after Pozieres, and in October, 1916,
Avon the Military Cross at Ypres for leading
a brilliant raid on Fritz’s trenches. Tie
Avas in command of his company Avhen the
end came on February 28.
Tom Skene, of Melton, who has been at
the Front for the last 18 months, and Avas
invalided lately, has had a bad relapse, and
is iioav in a hospital in Boulogne. His wife,
avlio is helping to nurse him, was formerly
Mrs. Tom Staugliton, daughter-in-law of the
Simon Staughton dame, of South Yarra. Be-
fore she finally accepted Tom the Second,
this much-sought-after little widow achieved
the almost unique distinction of being en-
gaged to three men in three consecutive
years.
Another well-known family mansion is being
“flatted.” Endion, Avliich is perched on the
top of South Yarra hill and belongs to the
Tramway Clapp family, is under reconstruc-
tion. The proud pile is only folloAving the
lead of the George Chirnsides’ Airlie, Fitz-
Gibbons’ Fairlie House, and the- Leveys’
Bowdon, all of them iioav hash tOAvers of the
naicest type.
The Norman McLeod widow, who passed
out last week at her Malvern home, was one
of the “beautiful Cunninghame sisters” —
social belles of the early ’sixties. Only two
of them —Mrs. McLeod and Mrs. William
Pearson (Kilmany Park) —settled in their
native country. The other tAvo married into
the blessed peerage; the elder hitched up
with the Scottish Earl Eglinton, while the
younger sister, after wearing weeds for a
mere “honorable,” had money and looks
enough to become a duchess.
Mrs. Geoffrey Syme has offered Banool for
a fete. Banool is a vast vacancy at present,
with a large sale-board decorating the fence,
now that the family has moved to Blytkes-
wood. The fete is to help the Berry-street
Foundling Hospital, Avhich has drifted to lee-
ward while cash poured into the patriotic
funds. Mrs. Sam Mackay is ringleader in
the bushranging. Mrs. Syme is supplying a
band as well as other extras; neighbor Alf
Dunlop is arranging a tennis tournament;
and dozens of women are making wonderful
things for sale.
The Caulfield Carnival had to fold its
Avings and postpone its gaiety on account of
the rain. But no one felt cheerful enough
to revel, anyhow. The tragic death of the
Bendigo aviator, Basil Watson, avlio was to
have performed, was oversliadoAving all Mel-
bourne.
Mrs. Marks is over from Fiji with her
daughter. The old plantation is doing well,
so they have put up at St. Ive.s and are
riding the social merry-go-round regardless
of expense. The naicest from hereabout Avho
visit Fiji have such a good time at the
Markses’ place that the visitors have got
writer's cramp accepting invitations.
First Griffith, C.J., Avas attacked by a
malady which caused him to depart at a
moment’s notice to Mount St. Evin's Hos-
pital, noted for the most ornamental nurs-
ing-staff in Melbourne. The Griffith dame
and daughter hurried doAvn to help nurse
the eminent family lawyer, and State Excel-
lency found them both on duty when he
called. The day after the Chief fell sick,
learned brother Toby followed suit with a
violent “affection of the nose,” and retired
to St. Luke’s for a spell.
Adelaide’s scandal
Saturday saw the opening of the soldiers’ home at
Fullarton, with Colonel Weir as the speaker of
the afternoon and the Premier and the Mayor of
Unley as also-rans. The credit belongs to the
Returned Soldiers’ Home League, which collected
£2OOO. To that the S.A. Lutheran War Relief
Fund added £5OO in cash and guaranteed half the
first year’s expenses up to £250. The Home is for
men who return from the Front incapacitated.
Mrs. H. H. Dutton and Miss Luscombe put in the
week-end with their Exes, the Galways at Marble
Hill, and went with them to the Repertory Theatre’s
presentation of Arnold Bennett’s “Honeymoon” at
the AValkerville Hall on Saturday evening. The out-
of-the-way thing was very well done.
Dr. 11. T. Burgess, who for 12 years was secre-
tary of the Children’s Hospital, has just indulged
in his 79th birthday. He came to Australia in
’lB, and in ’59 put on a Methodist parson’s collar •
and became one of that denomination’s star
preachers. But he would have made a still better
journalist.
The Blackburn-Kelly wedding was committed at
St. Peter’s College Chapel, with the guest list
limited to relations, and a coat and skirt for the bride
instead of the conventional satin and orange* blos-
som. Miss Hazel Kelly, as bridesmaid, appeared in
French-blue taffetas.
Died a few days ago J. R. Phillips, who in the
early ’sixties was the owner of Kanyaka station,
north of Quorn. His wife, who died some years
ago, was one of the William Milues.
Surgeon-Capt. N. C. Shierlaw, who has been on
field service in France for nearly 12 months, has
been decorated with the Military Cross. He is an
Adelaide Uni. boy who went thence to Edinburgh,
Avhere he took his L.R.C.P. After that he was resi-
dent surgeon at the Maidstone Ophthalmic Hospital,
and in 1912 he could write F.R.C.S. behind liis name.
Flight-Lieut. Errol Monk loft for England on
Saturday, after a long spell occasioned by A bad
smash.
E. T. Smith, who is always giving away some-
thing, has presented two pictures to the
Geographical Society—one, the “Old Colonists” Fes-
tival,” by S. T. Gill, of a dinner held at the back
of the City Bridge Hotel on March 27, 1851, in
commemoration of the anniversary of the first sale'
of town land; the other by Oscar Fristrom (now
President of the Queensland Art Society), of
“Tommy Walker,” the aboriginal who in his day
was one of our most noted inhabitants.
Major Lance Lewis, who was badly wounded at
Rafa, is at last out of danger. He was left for
dead on the field, but strong men can eat up
fields.
Tlie Victoria League of Victoria (roll of
drums here !) lately raised steam with a patri-
otic party. The Macedon branch engaged the
—er Workingmen’s Hall at Upper Macedon
for the occasion, and with Mrs. Oswald
Syme at the wheel made a profit of £6O.
Murdoch, president of the Hobart Cham-
ber of Commerce, attended the recent con-
ference in Adelaide. Mrs. Murdoch went
Avith him and, in her homeAvard flight
through Melbourne, chirped about the hospi-
tality of the Adelaide folk. Delegates
and consuls attended from all States. Rus-
sian Consul-General D’Abaza went over, but
had the bad luck to become seriously ill.
Ilis shadoAV, the decorative Dr. Klachko,
had a busy time socially. Mrs. Murdoch
had entertained him in Hobart, so was able
to introduce him to the Adelaide flappers.
Klachko has noAV gone on to Westralia,
wearing his most business-line expression.
He is interested in the Russo-Australian
direct trade, for which ships are now being
built.
The Arts and Crafts people are rearrang-
ing themselves for the year, and an election
storm Avill rage in the Society’s rooms (182
Collins-street) on April 18. The vice-regal
Stanleys will preside at a meeting in the
Council Chambers at 8 p.m. on that date.
The annual exhibition is due in September
and work is to be set going immediately.
Eric Hogarth, of the Gippsland and
Northern Co-operative Co., is to be married
early in the month at St. John’s, Toorak.
The dreamily-pretty bride-elect is Olive
Beatrice Greaser, eldest daughter of the
Robert Creasers, of Hawksburn. Eric is
the son of the late W. P. Hogarth, and his
Avidowed mother dAvells in Toorak. The
young people are now ordering Australian-
made Jacobean furniture.
The finish of the first exoeriment in
daylight savinsr finds many social souls with
small incomes thanking Heaven for one more
hour of darkness. The old evening-suit
that looks AA’ell enough by artificial light
showed up .horribly in the daylight. Men
discovered that their faithful old togs were
green, or pale purple, or streaked. Now
they don’t have to go out till an hour later,
and are saved.
The old draAving-room time-killers known
as Charades have been revived in the Very
Naicest circles. A brilliant youth w 7 ho Avears
a reject medal has been turned out into dark-
ness for his suggestion at one of these
affairs. The dear girls wanted to represent
the word "JeAvs.” so the bright boy said
“All hold your skirts up high and stand in
a row ! ’She-knees —Sheenies.’ There you
are!” The chaperones met at once and dis-
qualified him for life.
From a persistent traveller-friend: —
A small democratic reform has been made in the
Melbourne-Adelaide express, in the way of allowing
“booking” a seat in an ordinary carriage. Hitherto
only those who could afford a sleeping berth have
been able to reserve seats, but now a shilling will
make sure of a place. The Depaitment announces
cannily that only male passengers may book for a
smoking compartment.
Mrs. Oldmeadow (she Avas one of the
Tasmanian Clarkes) is visiting Melbourne
from the Speck, Avith a brace of daughters.
For 20 years she has lived in foggy Ilarley -
street, London, Avhere her doctor-husband
flies a brass plate. She and her girls Avere
about to return there from a. Tasmanian
visit when th<* edict “No Avomen passengers”
turned them back across Bass Strait.
Brother-in-law Norman Bayles is getting-
together a feAV frivols to cheer them up.
The A.N.A.’s have been conferencing-
through a Aveek of great excitement in the
country. The inhabitants of Murrabit, a
small place on the Murray, hit on a brave
Australian idea. They gave a banquet to
the visitors and spread it on huge logs among
the bracken and undergrowth near the river.
It Avas not a mere picnic, understand, for the
Murrabites spent £lOO on food and drink.
Superintendent of Agriculture Richardson
made a brilliant after-dinner speech about the
glory of being Australian Natives alongside
their finest river, and discoursed on the De-
partment’s scheme for locking the mighty
stream. The listening kookaburras hurrahed
and cackled with joy Avhen the human ban-
queters applauded him.
Generous Gertrude Rennie, the retiring
secretary of the Quamby Club, avlio has
given so much time and money towards help-
ing soldiers and sailors, is to receive suit-
able recognition. The Club committee is
getting up a Federal Gift. Not long ago
Gertrude was a starter in the Queen Car-
nival, and looked like winning for a time;
but the Gippsland competitor and the book-
makers’ lady proved too strong a double.
Mrs. George Box, who has been running the
Queen Adelaide Club in the Cultured City
is to be Miss Rennie’s successor.
Marie Tempest nibbled the edge of various
public entertainments last week. She put in
a fleeting apnearam e at the Ililder Picture
Exhibition, supported by leading-man Gra-
liame Brown. Marie’s hat was scrambled
over with buttercups and daisies, and was an
oasis of cheerfulness in a desert of drab.
The comedienne found Hilder’s Avork “abso-
lutely delicious.” On Tuesday she slipped
quietly into a box to see Miss Russ’s Carmen.
The diminutive Marie Avas smart in black
and Avhite and a coat of sapphire velvet
edged Avith fur. The opera Avas of special
interest to her, as she sang Carmen her-
self once.
Beatrice Day sends greetings from Paris,
where she is trying to establish a soldiers’
hostel. Her son, Robin Wall, Avho Avas seri-
ously Avounded, is now doing nicely.
Marie Tempest moved herself and her
clothes to the Cliveden Mansions flat so as
not to be too far from the Madden crowd.
This is right into the stage-struck Lesley’s
hands. It means that she’ll have every
facility for heart-to-heart talks with the little
comedienne on all sorts of subjects from A
(acting) to U (underwear).
Andrew MacCunn, the J.C.W. conductor,
is in Melbourne AA r ith his bride, Avho Avas
an Adelaide girl very Avell known in musi-
cal circles. MacCunn composed the music
and helped arrange “The Cat and the
Canary,” one of the feature dances of
“Canary Cottage.” It is a charmingly fanci-
ful idea and has a fine color scheme of
yellows, with a huge gold cage and a grey
puss.
The G.-G. and Lady Helen had a box for
the first night of “Canary Cottage,” came
back for more on Monday with a larger party,
and turned up again on Tuesday night with
a fresh relay of guests. There is much
dancing in the shoAV, and Hugh Ward sits
nightly in front with producer Burcher to
see where further detail can be packed in.
The best advertisement the show has had
was a verdict of “Shocking!” from a press
critic. The box office hasn’t stopped for
meals ever since. No shoAV has boomed like
it since the Avar started. The dressing is not
only up to the moment but belongs to the year
after next. The Carmen dancing-girls have
their black hair soaped to their skulls, and
the jet combs stand up like fans. A dull-
blue velvet Avaist-belt soon ends and leaves
.all the shoulders bare. The cerise skirts are
crinolined with only one wire. The white-
linen girls are perfect; they are the decora-
tive assistants of Madame the Cook, other-
wise Connie Ediss. Cook arrives w T ith her
own car and chauffeur, also a footman who
feeds a dog on specially-colored food. She
arranges for the drawing-room three evenings
a week, and reserves an- extra evening for her
bridge party. She then plays a Wagnerian
opera extract on a stove with two cooking-
spoons while the male supers strike frying-
pans and the white-linen ballet-girls dance
with china bowls and egg-beaters.
Irma Caron’s farewell was very weepy—
in the atmospheric sense. The rain descended
in torrents, but her admirers unfurled loyal
umbrellas and splashed along in great force
to the Masonic Hall. (It happened on Thurs-
day night.) The Hennessy dame, in a line,
deep armchair, was half smothered in a rug-
cape of ermine. David, her mate, must have
longed for his official rabbit-skins. Irma
wore three dresses —one at a time. She
appeared in a childish frock of painted chif-
fon that hung straight from the shoulders
like a pinafore. That Avas for the ballads.
For her “Butterfly” selections she got into a
scarlet kimono and black obi, and flirted a
fan. Carmen Avas dressed in black-edged yel-
loav cotton and a red silk sash with a particu-
larly fetching curl over the shoulder. Pianist
Fedora St. Ledger composed a piece for
the occasion and dedicated it to Irma. She
played the little effusion and shoAved lioav the
Old Masters had colored her imagination.
Then a little lady named Esme Macleod
whistled the “Tales from Hoffmann.” There
is a good deal about the Tales that should
be whistled. Esme performed in a black
frock with white fur around it. Amadio
fluted in his usual perfect way, and George
Chant managed to sing while arguing with
his accompanist. In the absence of Oswald
Rippon, another tenor amazed the audience
Avith his voice.
Etcher John Shirlow is having his natural
modesty assailed by American art dealers.
One Broadway firm has dispatched a Note
to the effect that the States are sitting up o’
nights waiting for samples of bis work. An
offer to hold an exhibition of his etchings
was coupled Avith the flattering assurance
that the firm was acquainted with his work
in England “and different parts of the
Avorld,” and had followed with interest his
“enormous progress.” ShirloAV is blushing
becomingly in response.
At the Russian Consulate some months
ago a young working-man Avas loudly remon-
strating about something Avith one of the
officials, Avhen the door suddenly opened and
the boss appeared on the threshold Avith a
horrified expression on his face. Said he,
“Gentlemen, do not forget that the portrait
of our Beloved Sovereign is looking at you
from the wall!” Large parcels of red
material were lately delivered at the Con-
sulate for the purpose of decorating the
walls where the beloved monarch used to
hang.
On their Avedding-day young Sam
McCaughey, of the Field Artillery, and his
bride, Major Dunhill’s pretty step-daughter,
Una Mackellar, were voted “the handsom-
est pair of the season.” Sam’s mother (noAV
Mrs. Jack Fisken) was before her first mar-
riage known throughout Riverina as the
beautiful Miss Gell, of Burrawang; so the
young soldier’s looks are hereditary. Wealthy
old Sam McCaughey, the bridegroom’s be-
knighted uncle, has never yet been led to
the altar, though there have been many
attempts to shift the rooted bachelor. An
enterprising Avidow was once staying in
the house, so the story goes, and one morn-
ing in the early summer Sam took her for a
drive. She poured out rapturous admiration
by the gallon, and as she stopped for breath,
having used up all her available adjectives,
the old sheep-man remarked with feeling,
“It only wants one thing to make it com-
plete !”- Seeing conquest staring her in the
face, the elated one gave him a fetching
glance from under her hat, and archly in-
quired, “And what is that?” “More water!"
rejoined the veteran, emphatically. She
left for Sydney next day.
On March 22 The Bulletin published a
paragraph in Melbourne Chatter referring to
the engagement of “a well-known man” A\’ho
had been divorced, and his approaching
marriage with “the lady co-re.” It is iioav
advised that the paragraph lias been taken
to refer to Mr. F. Maldon Robb and Mrs.
Heath (professionally Miss Nellie Billings).
The Bulletin had ‘no suspicion that these
people were in the mind of the Avriter of the
paragraph. Mr. Robb, who is about to be
married, certainly Avas concerned in divorce
proceedings. But (1) he Avas the success-
ful petitioner, the cross-petition of the wife
being dismissed; (2) the only issue tried in
the case Avas that of desertion, and no mis-
conduct Avas pleaded on either side, conse-
quently there Avas and could be no co-re.
The Bulletin is very sorry if the para-
graph has caused either party any pain or
annoyance.
Yours sincerely.
JOHANNA.

SILVEBSTREAM.
[Fop. The Bui,i,etin.3
At Silverstream in Maoriland the hours are very
young;
They dance to the measure that the cascades sing,
And the gay days at Silverstream are little beads
hung,
Turquoise and amber, on a fine gold string.
The soft winds of Silverstream walk down the valley
aisles
Laden with the gorse-scent and many tui-tunes;
They part the sweet manuka scrub and cross the
meadow miles
To frolic with a sea-wind tramping the dunes.
There-are great hills at Silverstream, mysterious with
trees;
Here and there a plume where the toi-toi nods;
And the green hills at Silverstream are down upon
their knees—
Down upon their knees, girl, like great grim gods!
’Tis fine to feel the tall reeds against the finger-tips,
The feet dance-dancing to the white stream’s strain;
For all the air of Silverstream puts music on the lips,
And all the hours of Silverstream go dancing through
the brain.
Dancing through the brain, girl, and every strolling
wind
Crooks a rounded elbow, inviting tired hands.
And the fragrance of Silverstream puts magic in the
mind.
The sweet winds of Silverstream lead on to magic
lands.
The waters of Silverstream throw lace across the
stones —•
Silver lace and silver spray all in-the silver air!
And the valley-place of Silverstream is musical with,
tones.
Like an old Greek chorus on a moss-grown stair.
The hunched hills at Silverstream are ponderous with
prayer,
And the incense of Silverstream is heavy round their
knees;
But the white clouds at Silverstream are twining in
the air,
And the swift wings at Silverstream are whirling in
the breeze.
White clouds and wings, girl, joyous o’er the meads,
Slim feet and swift blood, riotous with Youth,
Take the string of gold days, tell the glowing beads,
Where the streams and the birds chant the Litany
of Truth !
JIAOKILAND. BOYCE BOWDEN.
“Melos”: I don’t pretend to know much
about the biggest team on record, but I know some-
thing about a variegated one which Jim Cole got
together when liis waggon with 14 Polled \ngus
steers attached got bogged at Fineflour Creek. The
creek was up and a Syrian hawker, a Chinaman, an
abo. and two gins were bar-bound. After a little
persuasion Jim got the following on to the line of
14 black bullocks: Six horses (assorted), the three
blacks, Chinaman, Syrian, a white woman (Mrs.
Jim) and a boy (Jim junior). That did the trick.
Jim said that success was due to a lucky accident.
As the scratch team bent almost double the lash of
the whip came in contact with the Celestial’s hind
part. It was then the waggon moved.
“Bad Australian”: “Rag” is right about
the kangaroo rat’s succulency. I have eaten hun-
dreds of them stewed or steamed in the billy with a
bit of fat, a spud or two and an onion. Fixed in
that way it takes an expert to tell whether he is
eating rabbit or rat; but done in the way “Rag”
describes it must be a very dry banquet. The only
bush animal with sufficient fat to make a palatable
dish by itself is the porcupine, or, occasionally, the
young wombat. For really delectable tucker give
me the birds —the wonga in the South, and the
whampoi “up North.” When thistle-seed and scrub-
fruit is falling that tucker doesn't want any basting
to make a feast. For many years I thought that the
wonga was a strict vegetarian, but I shot one under
a wild cherry tree where I had skinned a wallaby
a day or two before, and instead of the usual cherry-
and thistle-seed 1 found the bird’s crop full of large
fat maggots.

“8.H.”: Pass me “M.P.A.” (B. 15/3/T7)
and his pulling elephants. He says that Toby,
Wirths’ champion, can shift 17 tons of wet canvas,
etc., from a dead start on a level road. Also, that
one first-class Jumbo is as good as eight horses any
day. Further on he says he would like us to see
what the Wirths’ team of seven elephants would do
with 12 tons of wool, and that if Wirths’ had to
depend on horses to shift their show, they would
never get half the one-night stands done. Let me
inform “M.P.A.” that he can take four draughts
out of any teamster’s turnout between Batman’s Hill
and the Gulf of Carpentaria and they will shift 17
tons from a dead start on the level. Eight good
horses will pull the trunk off any elephant and then
start 17 tons on a level road with slack tugs. One
Jumbo being equal to eight prads in “M.P.A.’s” esti-
mation, then Wirths’ seven elephants equal 56 horses.
What would this mob do with 12 tons of wool ? I-
will not insult the intelligence of my teamster
friends by going any farther on that line; but if
Wirths’ had 56 good horses instead of seven good
elephants they need have no worries about getting
to the next stand. They could shift the stand down
to the circus.
* * * *
“1.P.”: “Chink” (B. 15/3/T7) needs
plugging when he discounts Gregory Matthews as an
authority on Australian bird-songs on the ground
that he is “merely a cabinet naturalist” and hangs
out in Maoriland. Matthews may live in Maoriland
nowadays, though last time I heard from him he
was in the Cold Country; but 20-odd years
ago, when he was at school with me at the King's
School, Parramatta (N.S.W.), he was no “cabinet
naturalist.” He and his schoolmate, Lancelot
Harrison—now entomologist with General Maude’s
troops out Bagdad way—spent all their spare time,
and as much of their school time as they could steal,
out in the bush round Toongabbie, studying birds
and every other living thing they came across. Mat-
thews kept up those practical studies later on in
Outback survey camps and at his farm near Mount
Wilson (N.S.W.), where Holman and Davy Hall
admired the English trees the other day.

“Barcoo” :• Talking about sudden deaths
amongst sheep. Years ago, with assistance, I was
propelling 3500 weaners from Oura station, Upper
Murrumbidgee (N.S.W.), in towards Victoria. At
Wagga the night’s camp was an ideal one, just on the
town side of the bridge. The police paddock and a
huge bend formed the enclosure where the jumbucks
were turned loose. During the night they were very
restless, instead of taking things quietly, as tired
sheep should. The morning brought the revelation.
Twelve hundred healthy beasts were dead, and others
were suffering. During the same night a mob of
150 fat bullocks" were loose in the same enclosure, but
the drover discovered that they had decided not to
wait. They swam the partially swollen stream.
There was “Cumberland disease” about in those
days, and I nominated that microbe, though a stock-
inspector at Sydney declared for poison.
THE FUNCTION OF DOOLEY.
TRAFFIC-CONSTABLE DOOLEY : “Have ye got yer droiver’s license? "
MOTORIST: “ Certainly. Want to see it?”
T.-C. DOOLEY: “Phwat wud I be wantin’ t’ see it for whin ye have it wid ye? Sure, ’tis
only nicissary for me t’ see it whin ye haven’t it. Droive on!”
“E.S.S.”: The Maoriland shearing tally—
-1442 sheep in one day by six men, or an average of
240 per man —lately nominated for the belt by
“Larnb,” does not come up to Australian records for
a team; nor does the individual top score of 305. In
1910, at Cambridge Downs (Q.), 117,000 sheep were
put through in four weeks and two days by a board
of 38 shearers. In one day the whole team cut an
average of 1931 sheep per man. The top scorer was
Harrison with 265 ; then came W. Garvey with 209,
S. Hookway 250, J. Boyland 246, Jack Seary 244
and many others over the 200 mark. At Wantalay nia,
near Winton (1915 season), five shearers in one
day averaged 209 sheep per man. At Barenya (Q.)i
THE SORT THAT MEN TALK ABOUT.
MUZZY PERSON: “Phew! The bloke that caught that must have been a liar!"
on September 19, 1895, eight men averaged 236 each;
on the 20th 26 men averaged 175 each; and next
day Jimmy Power, the champion machine-shearer of
his day, made his record of 315 mixed sheep in less
than eight hours. The previous best tally was Jack
Howe’s 321 in eight hours 40 minutes, made with
hand-shears. He afterwards—on July 16, 1904—sur-
passed this at Alice Downs, on the Barcoo, shearing
337 full-fleeced sheep in 7hr. 20min. with the
machine. Power shore 40,000 in one season in
Queensland. For sustained effort by one man, Harry
Livingstone has set a good mark for the big guns
to go for. In successive days he shore 233, 225, 237,
237 and 221—’a profitable five days at 245. per 100.
Dan Cooper shore 315 with the machine at Bundoran,
Lower Flinders, in a working day in 1910. His
ordinary time in a shed, shearing all day, is under
two minutes for a sheep; his record for a single
sheep is one minute 381 seconds.

“L’Fou”: Fabre’s revelations about the
conservatism of the wasp make me want to advertise
the greater adaptability of our grey root-borer. The
original host-plants of this beetle were native gums,
but it now lodges in our fruit trees. Mrs. G. R.
, . , ,
Borer lays her eggs m rows on a gum-leaf; then,
smearing an adjacent leaf with a sticky subs ance,
she pinches both together with her legs The leaves
remain stuck and form shelter for larval. Since
taking possession of the smaller and more pliable-
leaved apple, pear, etc. the beetle has learned to
lay her eggs on one side of the leaf and fold the
other side over on itself. This saves the gumming of
~ , . , .. . , , "... “
one side and is a revolution in house building never
, „ ~ , , , , , , ... ...
before attempted and probably impossible with the
large stiff guin-leaf; for the borer isn’t more than
4in. long and narrow of build.
“Goathead” : In January, 1909, Mt. Mar-
low (Central Queensland) had just finished shearing,
and the plant and all hands except one man had
left, when down came 51in. of rain, completely
isolating the shed. Six hundred bales of wool were
stacked in the open, and through this stack the
water ran 2ft. deep. The man referred to was
employed by the shearing contractor, not the station,
so what happened to the wool was none of his con-
cern ; but at daylight next morning he set to work,
single-handed, caught a horse, “snigged” timber for
dunnage, dragged down the stack and set the whole
600 bales end up on the logs, leaving a clear air-
space between each bale. The job was finished by
dark the same day, and the only bale which
suffered the least damage was one of stained
pieces weighing 7cwt. This was so firmly
embedded in the mud that it could not be
shifted. The wool, which was afterwards
scoured at Ilfracombe, sold up to 261 d. in
London, and I believe the scour proprietors
still have samples. If any 1.W.W.-ite wants
to convert my friend to the go-slow religion
let him look up Stewart Smith, of Long-
reach. He is the bloque who did this record
day’s work.
“Ulooloo” : In addition to the yarn about
Australia’s “scentless flowers” and “songless, bright
birds,” I learned from a “Book of Curious Facts
that the trees of my beloved bushland have “narrow
leaves that turn their edges to the sun, and cast no
shade.” I was reminded of this when a bushman
acquaintance brought along a few blue-gum leaves,
and, running the rule over them, I found they were
from 24in. to 30in. long, and 4in. to sin. wide.
“And them ain’t the biggest,” said he. “Up that
gully where old Joe Elliott is camped, there’s sotne
—well, Joe says two of ’em ’d make a blanket!”
“Will Andy” : The swaggie had passed the
house when an old lady with a loud voice and many
gesticulations called him back. “Do you want
work?” she asked. His voice was jubilant when he
replied: “I do that. Badly!” “Well, I want a man
to pluck a fowl?” she said. Then he stroked his
whisker and his eyes grew sad. “Will you put
me on by the day or the week, missus?” he inquired.
* * * *
“Pick”: “Spraggs” (B. 1/3/T7) is off
the scent when he attributes sudden death of sheep
to bots in the head. On Monaro (N.S.W.) in the
late summer and autumn not 20 per cent, of the
woollies are free from bot-grub in an upper nasal
cavity, but no mortality results, and I question if
the grub can reach the animal’s brain, as “Spraggs ’
asserts it does. Neither is “black disease” account-
able for sudden death. In well-conditioned flocks
hasty driving will cause many a healthy jumbuck to
gasp painfully and throw the seven. An overload of
suet around the heart and other organs is probably
responsible.

OUDING’S COACHWORRS, 47 Parramatta Road, SYDNEY
“Werrimee”: “Talking of giant trees,”
said the overseer, “reminds me of two uncles of
mine. They started one Monday morning to chop
down a big tree in Gippsland, and when they knocked
off at dinner-time on Saturday”——- “Monday !” a
ginger-headed man corrected. “Saturday,” the over-
seer repeated. “Didn’t I say they started on Mon-
day?” “What were they doing the rest of the
week?” asked Ginger. “Chopping. When they
knocked off at dinner-time they reckoned they must
be half-way through. To make sure, they took a
stroll round in the afternoon” “I thought they
would,” Ginger interrupted again. “I’ve met a lot
of the gladiators who wrastled with that stick, and
they all did that.” “If you know so much about it,
let’s hear you finish the yarn,” said the overseer
irascibly. “When they got to the back,” Ginger
proceeded, “they met two other timber warriors who
had been belting in for a fortnight on that side of
her.” “No, they didn’t.” “What, then?” “Thought
you knew all about it?” “Can’t be the same sap-
ling.” “Can’t be.” The overseer folded his arms
and meditated. “Well, what happened?” Ginger
demanded. “Did they cut the tree down?” “No,
they didn’t,” said the overseer. “Why?” “There
was a big hollow on the other side, walled up, and
a selector and his family living in it. The woman
opened the door just as they got round, and she
asked them if they had called earlier that morning.
‘I could have sworn,’ she said, ‘I heard somebody
knocking on the back wall before dinner.’ ”
“Sassafras” : If the prize is for the biggest
money got for a warrigal’s scalps I reckon .Toe
Campbell wins. In the late 80’s, on Cudgeba station,
then owned by T. J. Riley, a dog introduced himself
by slaughtering a few jumbucks, and then helped
himself to 115 guineas’ worth of stud ram. T. J.
Riley sent for Joe and instructed him to get the
marauder. “What price is his scalp worth?” said
Joe. “Fifty pounds,” said the squire from Ireland.
“Right,” said Joe, “one hundred quid for a pair?”
“Yes,” replied T.J.R. Joe set off for the head •of
the Conclamine, where dingoes were very plentiful,
distance 120 miles, caught two in the one night,
strapped them on his pack-horse, arrived back at the
end of a week, and lifted his bonus. Joe revealed the
facts to me 23 3’ears after, when T.J.R. had left
for the “top station.” The two men had had a row
and Joe had trained his cattle-dog to collar a sheep.
111! assured me there was not a fox or dingo within
50 miles of Cudgeba.
“The Pariah”: Some time ago an Abo-
scribe asked for a “skeeter” cure. This is my ex-
perience. In 1905 three of us camped on an island
in the Campaspe (Yic.). The mosquitoes gave us
Sheol, and in the morning I could scarcely see, and
had to bathe my .face in a brew of eucalvpt leaves
to get it back to its normal proportions. From that
time until 1913 or 1914 I did not feel a mosquito
bite, though I was often bitten. Moreover, in China
I was through bad fever country, and though I did
not use nets 1 was the only one of a party of ( four
io escape malaria. How about some tests?
“Hopbooze” : The existence of the aborigi-
nal sign language referred to by “W.J.R.” (B.
8/3/’l7) was first recorded by Captain Sturt, though
he mistook it for a
Masonic formula.
The patient quest of
Dr. Roth has re-
vealed it as an elab-
orate inter-tribal cus-
tom, owing its
genesis to the needs
of warriors and trav-
elling natives, though
for inex p 1 i cable
reasons it is also en-
forced in tribal cere-
monies. The gestures
of the head, body
and limbs cover
every department of
native activity. But
the wonder inspired
by the scheme’s ap-
parent success fades
somewhat when one
reflects on the nar-
row limitations of the
mental activities of
the aboriginal. The most
interesting aspect lies in
the similarity of many of
the signs to those used by
white men to convey identi-
cal meanings. Notable in-
stances are the gestures for
“Yes” and “No.” “Civil-
ised” children largely adopt
I lie same method of expres-
sion, particularly under the
impulse of the primal pas-
sions of anger, scorn and
loathing. Dr. Roth com-
mented also on the existence of ceremonial songs
whose meaning was unknown even to the performers
themselves. Our own language contains similar
eccentricities —“Ta-ra-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,” for example.
“Melos”: Jay Jay” (B. S/3/’37) says
of sea-serpents, “These reptiles are not indigenous to
our shores.” As a matter of fact there are seven or
more species which inhabit the northern half of our
continent. The yellow-bellied is the most frequently
met with ; the ringed variety next. The latter have
overlapping scales (not possessed by the other
species), and are thus enabled to make short land
trips. Might as well keep clear of the brutes, as
the venom they dispense is guaranteed overproof.
MAKING IT COMPLETE.
MASON: “Yes, sir; and will you have anything beyond the inscription?”
BEREAVED ONE: “No; just that. You’ll make it ‘dearly-beloved wife,’ of course. And
‘Let ’Er Rip’ at the foot.”
“Wart”: Come under the shade of the
oldest apple-tree in Tasmania, if not in Australia.
It sprouts at York- Town, on the western arm of
the river Tamar, selected by Colonel Patterson in
1804 as the site of the first settlement and capital
of Northern Tasmania. Lady Franklin planted the
vegetable in what was then the garden of Govern-
ment House, and it still produces large crops. Last
time I saw it there were fully 20 bushels on it,
about three-quarters of them riddled with codlin
moth.
CLEANSED.
PARSON OUTBACK: “ And what did you say
when lie called you that?”
BILLY BULLOCK ( recently converted): “I
sez, ‘A little time ago I’d ha’ called you
a son of a-. But, thank
Gawd, that’s all over now. If I ain’t
got nothink else ter thank the
wowsers for — they’ve at least, put a
clean tongue in me-’ead.'”
“H.V.E.”: Re spine-tailed swift. There
are at least two instances of this bird being seen to
alight in Australia—once on the face of a road-
cutting near Bathurst, and once on the cliff-faces of
the Dromedary Mountain, South Coast of N. S.
Wales. Gould put the top speed of this traveller
at fully 200 miles an hour ; even a gun-driven black-
duck can register only about 80 miles in the same
period. By the way, bird-men aver that the spine-
tailed swift is a bird of the night-jar (or night-
hawk) family—the “goatsucker” of the ancients
—which has forsaken terrestrial spheres and gradu-
ally adapted itself to a life in cloudland. Whether
the row of stiff spines at the extremity of the tail
serve any useful purpose or not is doubtful. Inci-
dentally, the horny spine at the penultimate end of
the death-adder is now acknowledged to be not a
“sting,” but an organ which assists the beast in its
progress over rough country.
“0.5. H.”: Here’s another shearing tally
which will take a lot of beating. It is extracted
from an old Pastoralists’ Review (15/12/’08) :
“The wool could not be got away fast enough owing
to the quick team of shearers ; 30 (thirty) men shore
5552 sheep in one day and 50,423 in two weeks.”
This works out at an average of 140 sheep a day for
each man over the whole time, or an average of 185
sheep each for the best day. The station was Murn-
peowie, in South Aus.
“Bungendore”: I make one to accept
“Rag's” word about the frog found in an un-
creviced dolomite gibber (B. l/3/’l7). When we
were blasting through the solid cutting where the
Brown Mountain road tops the Bemboka Valley
(N.S.W.) a greyish, big-headed toad was dynamited
from the middle of a solid granite boulder 6ft.
through. No means of ingress to the small central
cavity where the creature lived was traceable. And
on Dr. George’s Mountain, South Coast (N.S.W.), I
once saw a sleeper-cutter split a toad from the in-
terior of an apparently sound log. Both these speci-
mens died soon after the atmosphere got to them.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: I can tell “Jay Jay” (B.
8/3/’ 17),. who wants to know if the lyre-bird can
be domesticated, that the female submits easily.
In the poultry-yard she will scratch, roost and lay
with the chooks; but the call of the wild is ever
too strong for the male, and he never resigns him-
self to be petted. It matters not at what age
he is made captive, he will get back to his natural
haunts if given a chance, and if not given a chance
lie will die sullenly. The now almost extinct koala
is an animal of similar mind. Though gentle and
docile in temperament, he will live only in the free-
dom of the bush.
* * * *
“Drofsed” : Ask “Eryander” (B. l/3/’IT)
to stand up while I give him the dimensions of the
largest centipede I’ve seen. lie stowed away in a
case of pineapples that came from Bananaland, and
had a long ride up to a country town in the AA im-
mora, where 1 took his measure. Verdict, lOin. I
pickled him in methylated spirits, and the exhibit
is in a sc bool museum up there now.
“O.R.II.”: An Abo-writer recently men-
tioned the enormous pear-tree on Kerrisdale, but
could not give its age. Mr. W. Dodgshun, the son of
a former owner, told me that when his father bought
the place 63 years ago the vegetable was then as
large as a fair-sized gum. lie was surprised at the
statement that “the pears were rotten to the core,”
as in his time the fruit was splendid. He also
described to me an enormous red-gum that grew on
the property, and which had been hollowed out by a
bush fire. It was known as the “Swagmen’s Hut,”
and deserved its name, for in its shelter one was as
protected as ,in a house.
» * ■» •
“Peg-Leg” : I’m not qualified to decide the
argument as to whether snakes swallow their young,
but this is dinkum. Fishing at Port Stephens
(N.S.W.) I hooked a female stingaree, opened her
up and pulled out eight young ones, about nine
inches long and creamy-colored. They were packed
in pairs, head to tail. Let them go in a natural
saltwater lagoon at Tenelba, and, returning a couple
of months later, found eight full-sized rays with the
Lord knows how many young ones.
PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION.
EX-DROVER ( with prisoners): “ Gripes,
there's all sorts and ages in this lot;
they orter been drafted first. It don’t
do a feller any good to go on the road
with a mixed-up mob like this.”
“Sarto”: Besides those birds mentioned
in a recent Bulletin I know others that sin? (or
(to the best they can) at night—the owl, plover,
cuckoo and a little grey chap to whom I haven’t
had an introduction, but who has got on mV nerves
more than once. He keeps chirping like a lost
chicken, and the monotony of it bores into one’s
brain. AVhat’s his name?
“Dinkum” : Re white ibis. If “Reynard”
(B. l/2/’l7) will take off his boots, roll his pants
up under his belt and wade into a reedy swamp on
Kaladbura station (Vic.), close to the S. Aus. border,
he will find enough nests of the bird to satisfy him
for life. And should, he be fond of eggs that are all
egg and no yolk—well, there are generally about 15
or 20 acres of them there in November.
THE ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The road runs up and over,
Out from the sleepy town :
Between green tares and clover
Jt leads to paddocks brown.
It takes the gully windings,
Tree-lined, and tucked away;
Climbs up the further valleys
To greet the light of day.
Oh, glorious in the sunrise
My road runs to the sea :
And, sweet and fresh, the morning
Bids me to follow thee.
My feet take up the highway,
All sun-kissed to the shore;
My soul sings on the long way
That lures me, more and more.
I shouted with the glory
That fairies showed to me. .. .
But the noonday and their story,
So different seem to be.
For the sun mounts up the sk.y road,
The grey dust drifts before,
Tired teams go down the drear road,
That falters to the shore.
Grey dust is on the teamsters,
Vanished the morning dew
My dreams are choked and dying,
My soul is dusty, too!

Maoriland’s picture censor is no
1.W.W.-er. In four months lie has inspected
1,840,070 ft. of film, and is still alive and
kicking—especially kicking. Since the
beginning of the year he has put the pencil
right through seven films, and 80 others he
has only permitted to be screened after
relentless scissoring. The movie merchants
in the Dominion are as much cut up as the
films, especially as they are informed that
hitherto the official “has not been so strict
with pictures as he intends to be.”
“Bob D.”: Let me drag Les Keast into
“M.P.A.’s” argument about the early'moving-
picture men in Australia. Keast took his
first film for Path 6 in 19.11, about the time
Cross and Bertel came into the field, and his
last in 1916 —the best pictures of the Blue
Mountains I’ve seen. He is willing to put
his name to Beau Smith’s affidavit that
Adelaide light is quickest and best for film-
ing.
“E.T.”: The Hun’s reputation for gross
feeding wasn’t born with the war. Band-
mann, the German mummer, who'toured the
world as Hamlet and Narcisse, once, during
a dress-rehearsal, found to his disgust that
the door which should have opened at a
push had not been unbuttoned from the
other side. Bandmann bellowed for the
principal mechanician—a lumbering, beery
individual over 6ft. long and broad in pro-
portion. When he appeared the mummer,
with many oaths mixed with his broken Eng-
lish, threatened dire consequences if the
door was not properly unfastened at night.
But at the performance the same thing hap-
pened, and Bandmann had to crawl in-
gloriously off the stage at the prompt
entrance to the accompaniment of laughter
from the audience. Dancing with rage he
sought the offending stage-hand. “You
beast, you wretch!” he screamed. “You haf
ruined my berformance! I could, I could”
—he raised his fist, but taking in the other’s
massive proportions, lowered it again and
concluded—“l could eat you!” “Shouldn’t
wonder,” returned the rude mechanic. “You
blighted Germans could eat anything!”
“Bluebeard”: Re Ada Ferrar’s hair (B.
22/2/’l7). The red wig she wore in “The
Prisoner of Zenda” was bought. Ada’s
hair is brown—or was when I last met her;
that was in London in 1910. She is the
wife of litterateur Shaw Sparrow, who
writes in a house in St. John’s Wood. Spar-
row is a kindly, very absent-minded, bookish
man. One night I dined with them, and
he came into dinner without his tie and with
his braces strapped over his evening coat. I
d’know. He might have done it on pur-
pose. Anyway, he’s got a par about it.
“Monkbarns”: Mentioned in “Poverty
Point” (22/3/T7), apropos Madge Tither-
adge as principal Drury Lane boy, that her
mother had been in the same line in England.
Add that, as Miss Santon, Mrs. Titheradge
played the name-part in the Robinson Crusoe
pantomime at Melbourne Opera House. A
few .will remember her as a witching figure
all in white furs. The attire was an exact
copy of that worn by Harwood in the Theatre
Royal production of Crusoe about 12 years
before. Mrs. Titheradge was a member of
Garner’s Comedy Company, with her hus-
band. They ultimately established a home
in Melbourne (Brunswick suburb), where
Dion, Madge and the rest were reared amid
Tith.’s daffodils.
“Norbell”: The other night my wife lured
me into a super-heated picture-dungeon to
see a tremendously boosted Amurrikan
“star” film. As usual, the names of the
great American artists, as well as those of
the producer, the “art” director, the office-
bov and the supers were thrown on the
screen. American-German Jews all of them.
The two she-stars concerned were simply
mannequins. One corset-advertisement with
her eyes blackened like an outed pug glared
into the camera for two minutes, then faded
away while the screen gave a half-column
account of her alleged thoughts. After that
she glared some more, took up three minutes
in opening a book, glared again, and van-
ished. The screen asked: “Shall I. greatly
daring, defy the cold conventions of a heart-
less world, or” —and so forth. For all the
lady’s expression indicated, she might just
as well have been saying: “Holy Moses, my
corns are hurting! I wonder if there’s steak
and onions for supper.” How much more
good mopey is going out of Australia in
return for this absurd rubbish? Yet, per-
sonally, I don’t so much mind the loss of
the money as that these unblushing Yanks
can make us think a thing is wonderful
simply because they tell us it is.
CHRISTMAS TRUCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“That Christmas we had a kind of truce and
swapped songs and souvenirs.” —Recent war chronicle.
It was Christmas in the trench ;
We were mostly half a-drench,
And the Bosche was making signals
For a truce;
So we answers: “Come along
With a carol or a song,
An’ we’ll ‘chop’ our Christmas pudding
For your goose.”
So we swapped him sooveneers,
And we told him dry his tears,
For he’d kiss his pig-tailed Greta
In the Spring;
And when things were gettin’ late,
We struck up the ’Ymn of ’Ate
Just to show him we was Cultured
And could sing.
And inside our British trench
On a packin’-case fer bench,
Sat a fine, big, bouncin’ Deutscher,
Fat an’ fair;
And a chap called Bogan Bill,
With us all admirin’ still,
Steadied Fritzie while he kindly „
Cut his hair.
Then when “Save the King” was done
Back the foe went to his gun
And his dugout, which was fifty
Feet below;
And when each was settled fair
In his own partic’lar lair
Rose the signal: “Ready, Fritzie,
Let her go!”

Business, Robbery, etc
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The George
Robertson Proprietary, after 65 years’ ex-
perience, is giving up the retail book trade.
Geo. Robertson opened his first shop in
Collins-street, Melbourne, where he had
William Maddocks, still on top, as chief sales-
man. In the early ’6o’s he sent Maddocks
to Sydney to open a branch, which later on
the manager took over, and subsequently
gave up to take charge of Dymock’s Bending
Library, from which he retired only a couple
of years ago. In the early ’7o’s the firm
sent Henri Tegart to Sydney to open a
branch, which he did in an upstairs room
in George-street, near the French Cafe. That
business grew into the enterprise that now
has the proprietary company’s name on its
billheads.
“Gustavus Gravelpit” : What’s in a label?
If Australian manufacturers want to know
let them listen to Brother Pratt at the
Ballarat conference of the Sons of Tem-
perance : —■ •
The word wowser was the greatest obstacle the
temperance movement had to contend with. People
said, “Oh, that’s a wowser!” And that was tire end
of it.
Incidentally, charge your glasses, gents! The
toast is “Wowser!”
* * * *
“8.1. D.” : If there is any method in the
Commonwealth’s fixing of prices it is hard to
find. For instance, it has complete control
of sugar, and in Melbourne, where some of
the stuff is refined, the price is £1 per 701 b.
bag, while in Hobart, which gets its sugar
from Sydney and Melbourne, you ban buy it
at 18s. Bd. per bag. On the same principle
it ought to be about 15s. in W.A. Perhaps
it is; anyway it is said that sugar refined
in Australia is £2 10s. per ton cheaper in
Maoriland than it is in Melbourne.
“Ron” : A friend of mine purchased a 40-
yard roll of • Japanese dress material. On
getting delivery he found the cloth was
specially woven to beat the buyer. The first
four yards of the roll was good-value
material, and the balance (about 36 yards)
about half the quality. With silks the Jap-
anese Government had to take control of the
export trade in order to protect the national
reputation, and such goods have to be
examined and stamped by the Government
before shipment. I hope they will extend
this system, as, of course, we must import.
* * * *
“Splendide” : “Murkali” says (B. 15/2/T7)
that a steady light is obtained from electric
installations on trains. When the train is
at a standstill the current from the accumu-
lators does not produce as good a light as is
obtained when the train is moving at sufli-
cent speed to cause the dynamo to generate
a current having an E.M.F. of 25 volts. It
is at this voltage that the dynamo (generally
by means of a governor) is automatically
cut in and charges the accumulators, where-
upon a better light is given. Should the train
attain a speed sufficient to generate in the
dynamo a current having an E.M.F. of 30
volts, the dynamo is automatically cut out, to
prevent injury to the accumulators. The
light then grows dimmer. Taking into
account initial cost, interest, depreciation
and maintenance costs, electric-lighting of
trains does not compare favorably with gas-
lighting. And it is incorrect to say that the
first cost in the case of electric-lighting is
practically the only one. Maintenance costs
are particularly high. Water—distilled water
—requires to be added to the accumulators
weekly and not monthly as “Murkali” states.
Sulphuric acid requires to be added, as the
solution in the accumulators is often spilt.
On top of that the first cost is heavy. The
one great advantage, in fact, of electric
light is its safety in the event of a smash.
- “B.”: “Chal.” (B. 8/3/T7) is hyperboli-
cal when he states that the best apples did
not sell below 3s. Gd. per 401 b. case last year
in Adelaide. I bought apples last March at
Is. per case, and the best Jonathans were
obtainable at 2s. a case. Supply and demand
control the price every time. In 1915 apples
were 9d. per lb. in S.A., and at present they
are worth somewhere about 12s. per case.
“Dry Ginger” : I wonder which brainy offi-
cial is responsible for the experience which
my firm had this week. We wanted to place
an order with one of the Australian manu-
facturers of the crown seals which are fixed
to most bottled refreshments to-day—both
hard and soft. We were, however, told
by the local agent that the Commonwealth
Government had taken over all supplies of
the necessary tinware. So our order must
go off to Japan or _ America, whose Austra-
lian agents have hitherto been consistently
turned down by us. Don't they make it
difficult for the good Australian !
“Good Australian” from Pago Pago:—
Just met an old friend tied up alongside our ship
—the steamer Dawn, for many years in the spud
trade between Melbourne and Portland (Vie). If
I remember rightly, she originally belonged to the
Belfast Steam Navigation Co., and was contemporary
with the Nelson, Western and Edina. The label,
“Port Fairy,” remains on her stern. Her skipper
says she is the best sea-boat in this part of the
Pacific Ocean, rides the waves like a yacht, never
takes water aboard, and neither rolls nor pitches—
though all this does not fit in with my recollection
of a winter trip to Geelong in 1877, when the Dawn
averaged six-knots an hour the whole voyage through.
Our cargo was mostly pig, and when the lashings
got loose you were just as liable to be hit by an
“Irish canary” as by a green sea-wave. Some day
when one goes to Geelong by aeroplane the old Edina
will steam this way, too, and carry coal, copra and
missionaries from here to Easter Island, 2000 miles
further on.
A Melbourne firm, styled the Cast Iron
Brazing Co., is making a startling claim: it
declares that it can save large broken cast-
ings from tbe scrapheap. Its patent is
“Lava Flux,” which it is alleged will so
mend broken hardware that its strength is
equal to that of the original casting.
* * * *
“Dry Shave”: If a fruit-grower has sur-
plus fruit, it’s only because he won’t use a
bit of savvy. Why on earth doesn’t he put
his excess into tin-cans on the premises? An
outfit for canning doesn’t cost much, and
can be worked by anyone. Look at the open-
ing in Bananaland for tinned pineapple, for
instance. Pines are selling at about 4d. a
ton ; preserved, the Northern towns will buy
all they can get at Gs. Gd. a dozen tins f.o.b.
Brisbane. Market-gardeners also can put
their vegetables up the same way. Eighty
dozen cabbages “canned” in Melbourne some
time ago cleared Is. l)d. per cabbage profit.
You can have cabbages here in Brisbane
almost for the carting away, yet every cargo
boat that puts in has cabbages stowed on it
somewhere.
* * * tf
“Itoyal Mail” : “Murkali” is wrong. The
telegraph accounts section is strong on the
point that someone must pay. So if the
postmaster lets the messengers hang on to
the cash, it is his own loss.
* * * #>
“Eedivi”: Billjim hates to waste money
at railway booking-offices. The s.m. at a
station adjacent to a Victorian auxiliary
hospital wouldn’t take a tenner for his col-
lection of false-alarm tickets. He can show
you Egyptian tram pasteboards, railway
tickets for nearly-every line in the United
Kingdom, the pass-out check of a Marseilles
variety show, a Maltese pawn-ticket, and
enough cigarette-cards to keep a boys’ school
wrangling for a year. They have all been
handed out as “bluffs” some time or other.
* * * *
From the S. M. Herald (21/3/T7)
Young Lady would like Advertise her Hair for all
kinds of Hair Tonics. , P.O.
In other words, she is prepared, apparently,
to get the public’s money by pretending that
Swindell’s Unrivalled Hair Tonic —which
she never saw till yesterday—is responsible
for the beauty of her tresses. Here is
something Archgaiters Wright might get
busy on. His religious text-book says some-
thing about stealing. Suppose, therefore,
instead of butting into party politics and
preaching Billy Hughes and (in spare
Christ crucified, he starts a cru-
sade against business dishonesty. He might
lose a good deal of his income; but, then,
he might save his soul. And an Arch-
bishop’s soul needs saving like anybody
else’s. Even Dr. Wright can’t get into
Heaven on his gaiters.
* * * *
“Billy T.” : The change in the commercial
Chow here in Victoria in my time has been
extraordinary. I remember him as a very
cringing, apologetic person, always cheap and
bidable, eager for custom, pathetically grate-
ful for the smallest donation. To-day he is
the most confident and independent dealer
with whom the Melbourne dames are trading.
If he is hawking greens he runs a fihe waggon
and a fat nag, where formerly he was content
to hobble all day long under two piled baskets
strung on a bamboo. He exacts enormous
profits on his “cabbagee” and “gleen pea,”
and if you don’t want to deal with him you
can be d—d. His troubles! In many cases
if you do want to deal with him you can be
d—d just the same. If another Chow in the
line has been serving you, Sin Fat says: “No
feah me ! You buy plenty callot belong Kip
Lee. Kip Lee welly go’ man. Kip Lee
serve you all li. Goo’day.” The fact is the
tribe of vegetable Johns in Melbourne have
the most complete, silent, solid and effective
union in. Australia, barring all competition,
holding on to top prices, and guaranteeing the
individual yellow trader such profits that a
suburban bank manager out where the Agony
most abounds is able to assure me: “No class
of tradesmen in this district handles as much
money as the vegetable Johns. They are
most of them rich—not merely rich according
to the common idea of what a Chinaman
accepts as gorgeous affluence, but rich with
the richness that might satisfy any of us.”
“Wilting P.” : There is nothing of the lily-
fingered knight of the ribbon-counter about
the shop-assistant who toils in the carpet-
room. It’s right enough in the winter time,
when the exercise of unrolling carpets for
customers and rolling ’em up again
afterwards is a good warmer. But in
the good old summer-time the toil is really
fierce. One fine, roasting afternoon of mid-
summer a pair of stout dames undulated
into my lair and took a couple of comfortable
seats in a favorable position between-doors.
They soon had me started, looking for some-
thing in blue, though very likely green would
do, or brown, and if not brown then dark
red or perhaps crimson. When they had
rejected the ninth carpet I had begun to get
my second wind, but the sweat was oozing
down inside my collar. As I hauled out
the tenth floor-wrap I heard one of the old
dears yawn a comprehensive, inside-and-out
yawn that went to the very heart of things.
Then, fanning languidly: “Looking at car-
pets on a hot day is such tiring work, Cora,
isn’t it? I feel —I feel —ah-h—quite a-oi-
arrmph /” and she yawned again. Carpet
number 14 was the one they bought, and by
that time the poor things were really quite
worn-out, and staggered off to get a few
cuds of tea. I went on rolling up carpets.
THE ARTISTE’S LOT AUSTERE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Fanny Weidt, singer and dancer, after a perform-
ance near Brunn, in Moravia, received 501 b. of
potatoes, 60 eggs, two sides of bacon, white loaves,
201 b. of flour, and other foodstuff. — Cable.
Th 6 good old actor as he read
Exhaled a sigh, and wagged his head.
“The times grow bitter hard!” he said.
“It seems these gay Moravian bloods
Corrected Madame Weidt with floods
Of common field or garden spuds.
“Hers was a bitter cup to swig.
She thought her act was going big,
And got two sides of salted pig,
“Some loaves of bread, and flour from kegs,
Two sausages like ballet legs,
And, finally, three dozen eggs.
“Poor dame, how did she hold the bluff ?
In my day as a cold rebuff
The sixty eggs we’d think enough!”

Speedometer
for Ford Cars
£2|l7|6
This special model of the famous Stewart Speedometer
is designed for Ford Cars.
It is constructed on the magnetic principle —the
principle that has proved far and away the most satisfactory
for speedometers.
One has only to take note of the number of cars on
the road that are equipped with the Stewart Speedometer
to see how wonderfully popular it is.
The reason for its popularity is its splendid efficiency.
It is easily the most practical instrument on the world’s
market.
A Ford owner requires a good speedometer just as much
as any other car owner.
He should keep track of his tyre mileage; of the
quantity of petrol and oil that his engine is consuming ; and
should have a record of the efficiency, economy and perform-
ance of his car.
He can only do this with a good speedometer.
Nine out of every ten car owners prefer the Stewart .
for this purpose. It will give you the same satisfaction as it
gives them.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The N. S. Wales “Nationalists” had
hardly done weeping over the scurvy man-
ner in which the Laborites threw McGowen
overboard in Redfern than the names of
their Senate three were announced; and
then it was found that they had thrown
overboard A. ,T. Gould, who had been a
Senator ever since the beginning of things,
in order to include ’Siah Thomas “as the
representative of the Hughes section.” But
that wasn’t base ingratitude. It was just
Win-the-War-for-Office politics.
“I stand here to-night,” said Hughes at
Bendigo, “as the leader of all that is best
in the Labor movement of Australia. The
men who stand with me are men whose names
have been watchwords in the camp of Labor
for years—comrades in this great fight by
whose side any Labor man might be proud
to stand.” Yes —Joe Cook, Brigadier-General
Granville Ityrie, Willie Kelly, Bruce Smith,
Irvine, Fairbairn, J. C. Manifold, Carty Sal-
mon, the Argus, the S. M. Herald, the
Adelaide Register: all Labor stalwarts
who have humped bluey through a thousand
drawing-rooms.
For the first time on record a Government
goes to the country making a virtue of the
fact that it hasn’t got a policy. But how
could it have a policy when its candidates
include such opposites as Irvine and
Josiah Thomas? What is it going
to do, though, supposing the war ends
this year? The Protectionist who votes
for the “Nationalist” without knowing any-
thing more about him than that he wants
to win the war is like a bank which calls in
a fire-brigade and says “Put out the lire,
and you can run the concern for three
years.”
Everybody, no doubt, feels sorry for “Jim”
McGowen, long-time leader of the N. S.
Wales Labor Party; but there is a crocodile
behind many of the tears that have been
shed over his defeat. If, for instance,
McGowen, instead of running against the
selected Labor candidate, had run as the
selected Labor candidate, would the S. M.
Herald and the Daily Telegraph and all
the rest of them have remembered his great
and long public services and barracked en-
thusiastically for him? If so, why did they
try to defeat him only three years ago?
BIG GAME HUNTING IN BLIGHTY.
1st ENGLISH MISS ( excitedly ): “My boy
has gold-mines in St. Hilda!”
2nd DITT O ( loftily ): “Mine has a large
cattle-station at Coogee!”
Holman’s unsolicited testimonial to the
P.L.L.!-
Three years ago I used your dope. Since then I
have used another.
The fondest dream of the Liberals in the
Phewsion party is said to be the shifting
of the calamitous Pearce from the Defence
Department. They try to throw the blame
on the Labor party—he should never, they
say. have got the job. Perhaps he shouldn’t;
still he not only got the job. but was con-
firmed in it by the Liberals when they
coalesced with Hughes. The return of the
Labor party at least gives the assurance
that a new Minister for Defence will be
appointed, whereas the Phewsion can give
the voters no guarantee of such a necessary
reform.
[Edmund Fisher, 369 Collins Street, Melbourne.]
Tasmania’s newest electoral law provides
that a State member may contest a Federal
election without absolutely forfeiting his
seat. In the event of his winning the
Federal seat, the State vacancy is filled by
the runner-up ; if he fails to win the Federal
seat he drops back on to his old perch. The
passing of the new Bill induced four State
members to qualify for Federal contests,
and the whole lot —three Labor men and
one Phewsionist—won in the selection bal-
lots of their organisations. Unfortunately
the law didn’t get through in time, so these
four had to risk their State seats when they
chanced a Federal contest. This suits State
Premier Lee very well: it looks pretty cer-
tain that the shuffle will give him another
follower or so.
POP!
THE BARMAID: “I suppose the big guns make
an awful noise when they go off?”
THE TAR: “My oath, miss; ’specially th'
petty officers — y’orter hear THEM some-
times!”
Brother Brookfield, one of the lately re-
elected members for Broken Hill, has been
blowing off again, and saying wild things
to liis constituents, who seem to like them.
Of course Brookfield is blamed; but he
doesn’t deserve all the blame. The State
Labor party is largely responsible for allow-
ing Broken Hill to drift into a condition of
lawless thinking and acting. For years past
—even before a Labor Government arrived
—things have been tolerated there which
would not be tolerated for a week in any
part of N. S. Wales less remote from Syd-
ney. One Government after another has
sown the wind; Brookfield is merely the
whirlwind that a neglectful State has to
reap.
Before they knew that there was going to
be a general election the respectable daily
papers took a very serious view of the
.Senate scandals. The Register (Adelaide)
was honest and frank about the matter
A serious reflection upon the character of the
Prime Minister or any other Administrator, in con-
nection with the conduct of political affairs, is a
matter of deep concern to the whole people.
It would be deplorable if the electors • were in-
different to the gravity of the accusations directed
against Mr. Hughes and the Coalition Ministry
relating to overtures to Senator Watson and the
resignation of a Senate scat by Mr. Reader.
Above all else it is most desirable that Parliament
shall be purged, so far as it may need purging, from
elements which have latterly brought it into dis-
repute.
But what now? Apparently, when it comes
to beating the Labor party, the “serious
reflection” is no longer a matter of any con-
cern at all. The pious “Liberal” editor’s
creed is: “Lord, give us a clean Parliament.
But give us a ‘Liberal’ Parliament, anyway.”
The cables deride the Phewsion’s attitude
that it isn’t' proper for the people to think
of “contentious” legislation at this time.
In Britain the biggest of all outstanding
social questions is under discussion in Par-
liament, ex-Prime Minister Asquith having
moved resolutions in favor of giving women
a vote.
To judge by his incessant complaints one
would think that all his life Mr. Hughes
had been going about scattering seeds of
kindness, and now has a right to be hurt
because the harvest is nettles.
Labor got out of three seats in the Speck's
Parliament to have a dash for the National
Parliament. Ex-Lands Minister Belton and
ex-Speaker Woods are running for the
Senate; ex-Whip Watkins is trying to bump
Laird Smith out of Denison. There is a
risk about it, because if both Belton and
Watkins should be licked, it is just about
certain that the two of them couldn’t get
back to the State House under Tasmania’s
system of voting. They represent the same
division, and in a by-election for two mem-
bers it is practically certain that one of
each party would get in. When you start to
put frills on your electoral system you get
some queer results.
Gregory Wade arrived in London the
other day and, as he had “recovered from
his indisposition,” slipped into the job of
Agent-General for N. S. Wales, which he
had never bargained for as the price of leav-
ing Australia and handing his shoes over to
Holman. Sydney Telegraph, commenting
on tlie circumstance, remarks that “this
brings a long story to an end.” But why
not tell the story instead of making grotesque
remarks about the qualities possessed by
Wade —qualities “which have inspired and
increased the confidence of the people in his
public spirit.” Does the Telegraph believe
this piffle? Or does it know that if it
accused Wade of being party to a frowsy,
disreputable act of political jobbery, no
honest man would deny the truth of the
charge? The Telegraph is fond of pulpit-
eering about “the standard of our public
life.” Very well. Let it take the circum-
stances under which N. S. Wales acquired
a new Agent-General and a new Railway
Commissioner and proceed with the sermon.
Dr. Deeper, the old Melbourne dominie, is
inviting the Vic. Council of Education to ask
that Australians should be given opportunities
to compete for appointments in the consular
and other branches of the British service.
This, he claims, would not only strengthen
the bonds of Empire but buck up education.
As an amendment The Bulletin proposes
that the Council of Education should insist
on Australian jobs—educational.jobs especi-
ally—being given to Australians, on the
ground that it would not only buck up edu-
cation, but also strengthen the bonds that
tie the Australian to Australia. In that con-
nection old' Walter Russell Hall, the Mount
Morganaire, set the Leepers and others an
example. When he snipped off a few of his
thousands to found travelling science
scholarships, he stipulated that the people
who won them should at least return to
Australia. lie couldn’t compel them to
remain here; but he at least hinted at the
fair thing.
HARD TO BEAT.
THE GIRL: “Ai suppose this wait is the most
feahful struggle the world has evah
seen?”
THE MAN: “Oh, I don’t know. I once saw
two Jew burglars trying to take money
from a Scotchman!”
So far Pearce and his Defence Depart-
ment have dodged every demand for an in-
quiry by Royal Commission into their awful
incompetence. But the people (who will
have to pay the bill) got something in the
nature of an inquiry last week, when
an officer was charged tvith heavy pecula-
tions from the Pay Office in Sydney. In the
end Judge Scholes, who heard the case,
gave the Department a certificate for “gross
mismanagement and accountancy chaos.”
Talk about the revolution in Russia! It
doesn’t compare with what is proceeding in
“Merrie England.” From time that runneth
back beyond the memory of man (or there-
abouts) rabbits have ranked as the sacred
private property of the landlord. They have
been “game.” Now, actually, the farmers
of West Surrey have petitioned the Govern-
ment for the right to destroy not only the
game that injures their own crops, but the
vermin of a neighbor on his property if, on
notice, he fails to do the destruction himself.
WIN THE WAR.
1st T ORY: “ Brother, tee must concentrate
the whole of our energies on the defeat
of the enemy.”
2ND TORY: “I am with you theuh entirely
—Labah must he absolutely routed.”
Australia is again getting a lot of hot-air
about “the solution of the metal problem,”
and is being assured by Mr. Hughes that,
through the miraculous ingenuity of Mr.
Hughes, the Germans have been cut right
out of the business. It is a hollow claim.
The Germans have been cut out of the
business because the British fleet is blockad-
ing Germany, and the Germans have been
no more cut out of the metal trade than
they have been cut out of the wool trade
and the wheat trade and the hide trade and
the trade in every other Australian product.
And they would have been cut out of the
trade just as completely if there had been
no Mr. Hughes in the world.
Australian soldiers abroad are to be handed
ballot-papers on which will be the names
“Ministerial” and “Opposition.” If they had
shown their patriotism by remaining behind
in Australia many of them would be able to
vote for an independent candidate; but as
they answered their country’s call, Hughes
hands them a menu on which are the items,
“Hash” and “tripe.” If Billjim remarks:
“Don’t fancy either much, but I could do
with a bit of mutton,” Hughes replies, in
effect: “Like your damned impertinence ! You
can take what I offer you, or go without.”
The frequent slowness of the Defence De-
partment in paying to soldiers’ widows the
money that is due to them is nicely balanced
by the Department’s eagerness to hand out
coin to those who are not entitled to receive
it. The Auditor-General’s report refers to a
case in which over £lOO was “paid for
leather which had not been received,” while
a similar sum was recorded as payment for
an issue of leather when “no such issue had
been made.” ’ And on May 5 Australia will
be asked to declare that the Government of
which Pearce, the responsible Defence Min-
ister, is a member, is the only crowd capable
of winning the war!
The beauty of being a Federal Minister is
that when you interfere with things you
don’t understand the other fellow has to
pay for the smash. Thus when the price
of soap was fixed in December last it was
overlooked that tallow might get dearer. As
a matter of fact it promptly rose about
£8 per ton, and, one after the other, the
Melbourne soapworks were closed and 300
men were thrown idle. So having fixed one
price and made a mess of it, the Common-
wealth Government now finds that it has to
fix some more; and it is just as certain as
anything can be that that will bump into
somebody else.

RUSSIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Long centuries he slept amid his snows;
And in his dreams he stretched a heavy limb
Tremendous over Asia to the rim
Of ocean; stirring in his age-long doze,
He crushed the insect-colonies that rose
Between his paws—yet all was blurred and dim.
Then in his sleep a flea that worried him
He lunged at, missed, and nursed his bleeding nose!
Now strikes the sudden sun upon his eyes.
The dawn! The spring! lie blinks in bleared
surprise,
Feeling a new warmth in his body numb.
From out his fur the winter’s frost he shakes,
And, following his dream, the trail he takes
That leads him lumbering to Byzantium!

HUDSON SUPER-SIX
Breaks Edge’s 24-Hour Record.
A Hudson Super-Six broke the 24-hour record made over nine years ago by S. F. Edge in England. The Super-Six went 238 miles
farther, travelled ten miles per hour faster, and covered 1819 miles in the 24 hours at an average rate of 75-8 miles per hour.
CARS
The Super-Six that made this record, under
the supervision of the American Automobile
Association, was a stock car chassis with a
racing body. It had the same patented
Super-Six motor, the same chassis used on
the 25,000 Super-Sixes sold in 191 G.
Now the Super-Six holds all worth-while
stock car records :
One mile at the rate of 102.53 miles per hour.
Across the great American Continent from
San Francisco to New York and back to
San Francisco —6952 miles in 10 days 21
hours 14 minutes —surpassing all previous
records, and the first car to attempt the
round trip.
First up Pike's Peak, an altitude of nearly
three miles, a climb of I2h miles in compe-
tition with more than 20 famous American
and European cars.
These records of endurance, speed and reli-
ability are due entirely to the Super-Six
motor, an exclusive Hudson feature that has
made it possible to increase the efficiency of
the Super-Six 80 p.c., and reduce vibration
to almost nothing, giving Hudson cars
added longevity.
In 1916 the Hudson Motor Car Comnany built 25,000 Super-Sixes, and to-day it
is the largest maker of fine cars in the world.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
lii order to dodge the chaos created by the
hot-cross bun industry page has to go to press
this week with a long-range view of the Doncaster
and Sydney Cup. As usual, recent form is' determin-
ing the public preferences, and Whitefleld, Spurn
and Giru have had more friends than anything else.
Of these three Whitefleld, if he gets over the tooth-
ache or whatever was the matter with him the other
day, may do best. His form at Melbourne looks
more impressive than that of the other two. He
is certainly a sweet galloper on the track. There are
at least eight or 10 mokes in this race with somc-
ihing more than a chance. If he neglects to alter
his mind before the day the writer will probably
toss the names into a hat and see what emerges
first. If it happens to be Balarang, First Principle'
or Whitefleld the destination of a dollar will be
decided. Anything else will have to be satisfied with
half a dollar.
Many people who saw Whitefleld flash
past Aleconner at the finish of the Bourke Handicap
(seven furlongs) at Flemington last month will
not hear of the brawny English horse being- beaten
in the Doncaster. He subsequently ran only, a
close third to Wolaroi and Lavendo over a mile,
but in that case he got pinched in between the
other two, and his final effort was checked. No wise
punter, however, will have a dash on Whitefleld
before the day, even though the imported gee goes
promisingly on the track. He may spring a curb
or otherwise go amiss. Whitefleld at his best is
undoubtedly very fast. And he is built to carry
fist, easily enough, like Balarang. But his infirmity
is attested by the infrequency of his appearances
in public since he came to Australia 18 months
ago.

There were a lot of people who felt very
sorry for themselves at the Hawkesbury meeting on
Saturday. Mo started to paste Cetigne for the
. Doncaster, offering fully twice the odds obtainable
I lie day before. As the horse had been doing excep-
tionally well on the track during the week, this
unusual liberality was enough to set people thinking.
But Cetigne is a good, honest horse all the same.
* * * *
Punters who had been speculating in
Wolaroi stock for the Doncaster had to start hunting
for a recovery at the end of last week. The colt
was struck out of the list. Trouble: a filled leg,
supposed to bo the sequel to a tired suspensory
ligament. Pending confirmation of the diagnosis,
Wolaroi was left in the w.f.a. events; but at tire
time of writing it looked as if these were not for
him. Whether Wolaroi would have started for the
Doncaster anyway is a bit doubtful. He bad a full
share of weight, it is a mighty har'd race to win, and
the other events are liberally decorated with cash.
Court Jester’s achievements thus far are
loss for his Sydney Cup following than
owner Eric Connolly’s reputation for cleverness at
the .game. Ever since Connolly paid £7OO for
the dandy son of Comedy King he has been credited
with exceptional powers. Conriollv is supposed' to
be an infallible judge of a racer, a wizard in the
art of training it, and one or two other things.
If anyone looks beyond Court Jester for the
winner of Sydney Cup it will be for reasons un-
connected with the handicap. This horse is very
well treated, and it is only people who “know some-
thing” that will by virtue of their information win
if the Court Jester misses. And well handicapped
horses do miss, very frequently, since condition is
a long way more important than calculations on
paper. If Lingle is worrying the rest towards the
finish, the foregoing fact will be beyond dispute.
Good judges are wondering whether the
best has yet been seen of Greencap. His last per-
formance at Flemington was his best to date; but
the uuggety animal was not looking in the pink
of condition at the time. ' The trip to Sydney
appears to have improved him, and if his stamina
was quite proved he would again look a very
likely thing for a place in Sydney Cup. Last year
he ran second.
* # * *
Baronet Cooper’s imported Sydian has
now won three races—-two at Hawkesbury and one at
Randwic-k. Sydian’s success in the Hawkesbury
welter on: Saturday was expected all round. He
started at "> to 4 on, and was six lengths ahead of
Pink and Blue at the end. Sydian is good with a
bit of weight on board.
Reganl ed as a certainty for Hawkesbury
Flying Handicap on Saturday, the two-vear-old
classic winner Manna (Varco-Mango) ran well for
five of the,six furlongs at 10 to 9 on, and then faded
out of thje business. It takes a remarkably fine
youngster ]to land the goods in open company these
days, and jon Saturday La Steppe led Manna all the
way and did the books a good turn. La Steppe
opened at 14 to 1 but blew to 10’s before the finish.
All of which goes to show that Mo does not know
everything, La Steppe opened at a short price be-
cause the jbooks thought she would be the crowd’s
fancy.
It looks as if Kelso’s black Narivo has
decided to earn some of what he owes before leaving
the course to become a hack or cab-liorse or what-
ever happens to a gelding when his racing days are
over. Narivo secured the Hawkesbury Autumn Handi-
cap on Saturday in good style from a fair field. TTe
was well backed too. A bit of distance is to the
liking of this unsexed noddy, hut it is only lately
that he began to show any sign of the form he
produced when owned by the late Charles Hebden.
Among horses behind Narivo on Saturday were
Yankefe York, Canzone, and Lady Boniform, who are
engaged in Sydney Cup.
At a Sydney pony meeting tlie other
day an animal was noticed travelling at the end
of a race with a rapidity for which there seemed no
visible justification. The mannikin was not riding
the nag—it had no chance of winning—-yet there
it was tearing along in the ruck like a politician
in pursuit of the last critical vote. Wherefore the
authority which rules over ponies was seized with
a dark suspicion about a nigger in the wood-pile,
impounded the jockey at the scales and induced him
to abandon his clothes. Result—discovery of an
electric battery. Consequence—life disqualification.
The contraption seems to have bolted with the
abbreviated electrician in charge and led to the
pony imagining itself pursued by 175 veterinary sur-
geons. Tile idea of equipping a jock with a scien-
tific pace-persuader is not a new one, and is not
going to get more popular until the hurry-up switch
can be turned off at the right moment. When that
day. comes the time' will be ripe for liberating the
prads attached to nothing but ironmongery and reli-
able dynamos, thus establishing once more the
superiority of machinery over human hands. But
The Bulletin suspects that the preliminary over-
haul of the hardware will have to be done by a
Judge of the Supreme Court.
“Stinger”: The disqualification of W.
Kenny for carrying an electric battery while riding
on a Sydney pony course re-opens an old argument.
I don’t want to defend it, but I fail to see where
there is a difference between it and the spur and
whalebone which are allowed. During my time I
have seen many horses return to scale with blood
flowing from their sides because of the vigorous use
made of the hooks, and on at least one occasion I
saw a boy haled before the stewards for knocking
his conveyance about. No doubt something is
required to goad a slug into action, but why let a
horse be torn by spurs? Personally 1 would rather
receive an electric shock of the power likely to
come from a small battery than have spurs kicked
into my ribs.
Others besides the wowsers will reckon a
reduction in the number of race days in Maoriland
a fair thing just now. The country has far too much
racing for toleration by any reasonable man—too
many tinpot leather-flapping institutions which could
be wiped out with great advantage to the general
community. In some provinces there are race-
courses every few miles. On some of these the
character of the sport is entitled to all the admira-
tion it receives. At any time the position that
prevails thereabouts is indefensible except on the
ground that the interests of weed-breeders, booze-mer-
chants, totalisator commissionaires and the least
respectable kind of “trainers” are worthy of considera-
tion. There are very fine courses at the principal
centres. If these cannot provide enough racing to
meet the requirements of •Maoriland, Bill Massey or
somebody should begin to ask the metropolitan clubs
to explain what they exist for.
* * * *
This ought to knock tire bottom out of
some of the records. Jockey Clarrie Iveir, who was
on Precision when she won the Autumn Handicap
at Koorawatha (N.S.W.) the other day, has ridden
the same mare to victory on 54 occasions.
* # * «
It. G. Casey, since 1903 a member of the
V.U.C. committee and for some years chairman, has
resigned. He lias two sons at the war and he is
himself in England and not likely to return to Aus-
tralia until he has seen the finish of the big event.
In business “R. 0.” is connected with Ooldshrough’s
and Mt. Morgan: and ho could tell an interesting
story, if he liked, about an interview lie had with
Billy Hughes concerning a big sale of copper early
in the war. He chuckles over it still.
Victoria appears to be suffering from a
pony-meeting form of government. The same Peacock
Ministry which refused to introduce the tote now
seems to be looking for an excuse to increase the
annual allowance of meetings to John Wren and
other private-racecourse proprietors. Seeing that
various Labor members in Victoria are notoriously
addicted to punting at pony meetings—which, by the
way, would receive their death-knock if the' tote
were legalised—it looks as though Peacock and the
Opposition had struck a little bargain.

There was a double supply of smite at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday, artd calamity arrived
by a short cut in two places. Bobbv GVaham, the
Bananaland fly-weight, was annihilated by Fred
Wastie in the fourth collision. Leo Covie, of Mel-
bourne, survived seven rounds with Matt Murphy
and cut about even. In the eighth Matthew smote
the visitor hard and often and then disrespectfully
deposited a fistful of insomnia under Leo’s chin.
Leo slept the sleep of the bust.
Benny Palmer kept the Star-Spangled
Banner out of Hew Edwards’s grip at Melbourne
Stadium on Saturday, mainly by breaking away
from wratli when it seemed to be nigh. It was a
good go, with most points in the custody of Wales.
Harry Stone is cavorting round Edwards these days
with incitements to scrap, but up to the other day
Edwards had neglected to take notice.
* * * *
At Brisbane on Saturday, Wave Geike
and Sid Godfrey resumed their discussion with more
monotony than.ever. For 11 rounds Geike’s desire
to wound the enemy’s commissariat, and Sidney’s
efforts to stop him, combined with frequent clinching,
produced a great weariness. Then Geike came
strongly for two rounds, and Godfrey, waking up,
hastened to produce reasons why the other cove
should retire: But Sidney missed the ’bus.
Geike’s persistent visits to the pantry early in the
evening had not been made in vain. Frank .Thorn is
to be resurrected at Easter for Godfrey's benefit.
There is a yarn in recent. Yankee news-
papers about Darcy being on the verge of converting
himself into an American citizen. Darcy, it trans-
pires, has grown very fund of Yankeeland and
wants to be naturalised. This must be a libel.
Darey merely went to the U.S.A. as a preliminary
to acquiring a wad before proceeding to Canada or
England to enlist. Anyhow, that is what lie said
was the matter with him. The mere fact that he
lias not yet had a Jight in America, thereby leading
to the postponement of wad-accumulation, is a mere
detail. If Uncle Sam is not careful Darey may get
tired of waiting for someone to find £37,562 for
a match between him and Jeff Smith, whereupon he
may slip down into the bunkers of a Cunarder and
thus reach Liverpool to do what he was so yearning
to do in Australia.
* *. *
This is the story as the professional
strong .man told it. He had been showing his prize-
potato muscles and expanding his prodigious chest
with a small semi-circus in the country, when chance
gave him an opportunity of heaping horses and
things on his Juno-like bust for the gratification of
metropolitan gatherings. The stranger came in one
night with a slight list, and said his name was
Thomas Dobbie. He was an unprepossessing person
with dust in his hair; but he had a fine business
instinct and got right down to the point. “I don’t
work,” he said, “and I don’t intend to work. I’ve
done pretty well at my profession. I practise being
run over by motors and talcing compensation. I
have been run over five times this year and my
compensation totals £65 pounds to date. You can
call that three months’ earnings, an average of
£260 a year. Now, sir, with your chest and my
experience we could rake in ten times as much.
So I propose a partnership, you to be run over,
me to do the negotiating. My system is simple.
You lurk at gates, and go down under the car
coming out. 1 will teach you the trick. It is
simple and safe. I could have done much better,
but 1 have always had to pick my cars. I have a
comparatively weak chest. 1 could avail myself of
only the lighter kinds of cars. The owners of light
cars are not, as a rule, affluent. You could take on
anything. I saw you permit the wheel of a loaded
dray to pass over your body. My friend, I would
get you £2O for that out of the owner of a four-
seater, and you might do it two or three times a
day. We could work all the capitals in rotation.
Believe me, iny friend, there is a fortune in it. It’s
a shame to waste a chest like yours—a crying
shame.” The strong man is considering it.
“M.P.A.” has a word to say about a
fellow amateur ped: The Bulletin's good contribu-
tor Frank P. Brown, who, after his wanderings in
the Territory and elsewhere, pushed himself into
khaki, is now out at the artillery camp near Mel-
bourne. Before Brown got the travel fever which
took him over the planet, lie cut much ice as an
athlete, capturing no less than 40 medallions before
he reached his majority. He was a fine exponent
of the Kranslein style of hurdling, a most scientific
and pretty method. Over the sticks he captured
the 120yds. and 440yds. hurdles championship of
Victoria, and topped this performance by winning
llje 440yds. Australasian event at Sydney the year
that Nigel Barker and “Dad” Wheatley did so well
on the flat. Brown also cleaned up numbers of
handicaps and was easily top-dog in the Cabbage
State until giant Leslie Davis came to light. With
the gloves he went within an ace of winning the
middle-weight amateur champ., being beaten in the
final. He had to reduce too much to make the
weight, and though he won two rounds of the three
lie went to pieces in the third and .went under on
points. He was also a high-flier at catch-as-catch-
c an, and helped to get the husky Bill Squires , into
condition. Like several other good college chaps
he turned up the game before his time. This may
have been owing to an illness he had some" years
back. As an all-round athlete F. P. Brown carried
a good many guns, and he should take to the sol-
diering game as a cat takes to milk.

“Will”: 11, ro !iro the starters: Kangaroo,

one mile or five the ’roo would carry my bit. Can't
give the emu a look in with him. I’ve chased both,

The four League teams —-’Itoy, Carlton.
'Wood ' and Richmond—that booted the inflated

ter for the benefit of Patriotic Funds, promise to

Gordon 11. played high jinks in Sydney
junior cricket against Western Suburbs on Saturday,
409 being on the sheet for eight wickets when the
ring-off arrived. This is the highest innings score
in Sydney cricket during the season. There were
three centuries—Brand (174), Clark (120 not out)
and Mitchell (126).
*■:***
Victorian cricket put up shutters on
Saturday, with Carlton the only unbeaten team for
the season. In the last match Trueman (Carlton)
by annexing 13 wickets for 132 runs demoralised
South Melbourne and brought an innings victory to
the premiers. Mingled with the cheers at the wind-
up was an “extra” for Captain Tom Warne, who has
banged tlie ball for Carlton for 25 years, and on
this season’s form certainly looks fit to decorate tlie
team for another quarter-century.
11. B. Whitta (Christchurch) is making
a noise in this season’s Maoriland cricket. Whet:
last heard of he had piled up 889 runs at an average
of 98.77 ; included are five centuries. This is a
record never previously inflicted on the Ricketty
Tsles.
11l the N.S.W.-Bananaland inter-State
rifle match (25 aside) Ma won—l92l to 1537. F.
Greer, J. J. Mathieson and R. Mudd (N.S.W.) all
made a “possible” 80. Bananaland’s top-scorers were
Irving, Graham and O’Leary, each 77. Included in
the Northern team were five ladies, and t Miss Hassock
(76) headed 27 out of the 50 competitors. The
ladies (travelling as the City of Brisbane Club)
afterwards tackled Randwick Institute, but went down
by 611—563.
**. * *
Ella Mitchell, of Peak Hill, near Forbes
(N.S.W.), went down to the rifle butts the other
day, and, in the quarterly competition, 50 shots at
various ranges, she tied with Sam Albert, the score
being 172. In the shoot-off, 10 shots at 600yds.,
they tied again—47 out of a possible 50. In a
further test from the same range each scored 20.
Deciding to finish one way or the other they fired
shot for shot, the first to drop a point to lose.
Albert dropped the first point, and Miss Mitchell,
scoring a “bull,” walked off with the bacon.

Manly’s success in the 250yds. Northern
Suburbs teams championship (under 20) on Saturday
wiped the last big N.S.W. swimming event off the
slate. C. Crackanthorp, T. Lough, G. Wild, J. Huie
and W. Herald made record figures—2min. 13 2-ssec.
Same day, at Fort-street High School sports, S.
Crackanthorp won the 100yds. school championship
(68 2-oscc.), 50yds; (tinder 15), 880 yards cham-
pionship, and the diving championship, was second
in the 50yds. (under 16), and helped 4B to win the
senior relay championship. The Crackanthorps had
a busy day.
“L.” : A green turtle was recently hooked
off the jetty at Byron Bay (N.S.W.). first with a
bream line and then with a jew line. The big fellow
was manoeuvred to the side of the Orgra and hoisted
hv means of a cargo landing-net. From appearances
the turtle would weigh about 3cwt., and was sent
to Sydney for marketing. A somewhat larger one
shipped from the bay some years ago brought £5.
“Lantana”: A 401 b. cod (301 b. cleaned)
was caught in Wilson’s Creek (N.S.W. North Coast)
recently by R. V. Wiley. This is claimed to be a
record for “the crik” ; how does it compare with
minnows in other localities?
“FI.V.E.”; Fishermen occasionally, but
rarely, haul in the electric-ray, or numb-fish, brother
of the common stingray, or “stingaree.” One cap-
tured at Balmoral Beach, Port Jackson, dealt out
short, sharp shocks for some time to curious visitors,
until, with the approach of death, its battery ceased
work. The fish brings its dynamo into play by
raising its wing-flaps and closing them suddenly. It
is said to be fairly numerous on the N. S. Wales
coast, but, like most of the rarer rays, is very
seldom captured. Most of the ray family are
edible, and some of ours are equal to the skate of
European seas. Our skate, by the way, seldom
finds its way into the market, and the same is true
of the Australian anchovy and sardine, the first of
which is quite equal to the anchovy that we import.
* * * *
“Wart” : Talking about fish, how about
this for a record catch? (Puff —this is where I
blow out the match.) Wo were staying at a seaside
cottage which was rarely occupied except during
the school holidays. After a night’s rock-cod fishing
the lines were brought home still baited with pieces
of shark and thrown down outside the door. Next
morning three of the lines led through a hole under-
neath the house. When the first one was pulled up
a native cat came up on the end of it, and made
things pretty lively until laid out with a batten.
'lhe second one brought another native eat. The
third had a Tasmanian devil fastened to it; and
he made things livelier than ever.
“H.Y.E.”; The public took hesitatingly to
leaiherjacket meat, and these once-despised fish now
sell in Sydney at from 4s. to Os. a basket. Chunks
of snow-white meat from the flanks are first-rate
when fried. Strangely enough the “old wife,” or
peail perch, too, finds little favor. I once fried a
heap of these finned freaks caught at Chinaman’s
Beach in company with more aristocratic flatliend,
black bream and blaekfish. The perch will do for
m .®\ old wife (opaque yellowish-white in color,
with broad vertical bands of brown and a sharp
snout) is seldom, hooked, but yellow-tail experts
catch ood ones in the vicinity of unfrequented
wharves. As the tide, sweeps into Middle Harbor
(Port Jackson), old wives in small companies nun
be seen scurrying along towards their feeding-grounds
while at intervals the leading fish suddenly stop
short and the crowd bunch together for a time, as
thoug.i for a confabulation.
The Tasmanian trout which are doing so
well in a. Aus. rivers are to have a sporting chance
in the Harriet and Eleanor, two streams of which
nobody but the Lands Office lias ever heard. These
are in the wild country at the “back” (or south) of
Kangaroo. Island, and the fish are not likelv to be
disturbed there—unless, indeed, they do well enough
to get the district opened up as an angler’s resort.
Bill Plain, M.L.A. (Vie.). selected
Coahshmaehte for the Senate, farms at Lara
in his spare moments. Pie seems to have
clone fairly well at it. and not long since
performed the kindly task of importing his
parents from the Cold Country to give them
a taste of real life in their declining years.
“L.J.F.”: Old Tom Boyle, who lias just
passed away in Melbourne, was one that for
half a century could be depended on to go to
an Irish political meeting and make a
vehement speech. lie was once a teacher
in a school where I was a pupil. Spite of
that he lived to 82—a bachelor. Born
in Staffordshire of Hibernian extraction, he
spent years in Ireland as a teacher. In* the
middle of last century a crowd of school-
masters came to 1 ictoria. Tom was one of
them. Some over whom he held the cane
were George levers, of the City Council; the
late Joe \Y inter, of the Melbourne Advo-
cate ; and D. G. O’Donnell, lung known as a
Melbourne detective. I stood by my old
master’s coffin in the Hawthorn R. C.
Church a few days ago when he was buried.

Grey Hair—Home
Remedy.
An old-fashioned, home-made recipe restores
youthful appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey hair
is not desirable and plenty of reasons why
hair dyes should not be used. But, on the
other hand, there is no reason why you
should have grey hair if you do not want it.
To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One has only
to get from the chemist two ounces of con-
centrate of tammalite and mix it with three
ounces of bay rum. Apply to the hair with
a small sponge for a few nights and the
greyness will gradually disappear. This
liquid is not sticky or greasy and does not
injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the for-
mula. — Advt. [2

That is to say, there was a total loss for
the half-year of £715, after allowing for
depreciation; and that loss was made up this
way:—Loss on business, £464; loss on
realisation of assets, £251. It has been a
distressful business: and the directors are
pulling out of it as fast as they can.
‘During the period under review,” they say,
three cars were sold for a total of £930;
and early in the present half-vear 15 more
cars were sold on terms for‘£3ssl to an
association composed mostly of the oo.’s
diivers, formed to conduct t e co.’s hiring
business. Assets consist of leasehold and
machinery £1912; plant, £18,188; cash and
sundries (net), £2345; total £22,445.
Iliere are 27,130 shares, which were
lecently entitled to draw Is. each by way
of return of capital. How much more they
will get depends, of course, upon what the
assets bring; and that £250 was lost on the
sale ot the first £lOOO worth doesn’t look well
tor the sale of the sediment at book value,
lhe co. used to have about 54,000 pref.
shares, which the public subscribed for; but
halt of the capital was written off as lost
long ago.

the totals for the two claims and
8, <90,000 cub. yards have given nearly 6330
tons tin oxide to swell the. wealth of
the Miller, Harvey Patterson and Gibbs-
Rnght crowd, who went into the mine on the
advice of Ilyan. The average for the whole
of the dirt sluiced out of the Pioneer lead is
1.6711 b., but at the lower depth worked to-
day the grade is down to 1.2381 b. The com-
pensating factor is that costs have dropped
from a general average of 6d. to under 4|d.
per cub. yard, owing to the substitution of
electricity for steam. In the first term last
year costs were got down to well below 4d.;
higher wages and a reduced yardage
handled—the latter was due to the floating
of the barges into new positions—biffed them
up nearly Id. in the second term. But
things will be all right again this current
half. Two divs. of Is. each went to the
fatted calves of the co. during the half-year.
N °w the bigger yardage and the jump in tin
to £-13 will bring in more cash for the tax-
collector to levy on.

The output of N. S. Wales coke has
doubled in five years. Last year’s lot was
worth £387,571, following £313,241 (1915),
£213,069 (1914), and £208,989 (1913).
Shipments to oversea and inter-State ports
have become a feature of the trade, and it has
been difficult to supply orders given at short
notice. In consequence of this Queensland
metallurgists are giving Ipswich coke a trial.
The coal seems good enough; but the appli-
ances are old-fashioned—though, for that
matter, so are most of the ovens in N. S.
Wales.

is running the old Wild Cherry for all it

held on March 27, and the balance-sheet
• showed a debit of £1220. The new co., after
taking over from the Wild Cherry, repaired
the plant and did some development work
before it started to crush in November. It is
very _ sensibly making the most of shallow
alluvial deposits easv to treat, and from
which high-grade 70 p.c. tin concentrates can
be produced. The tin market is helping: it
has sailed past £2lO again, and forward

T. J. Whaley, the oil engineer who has
been backing the Robe country in S. Aus.,
left for the U.S.A. a couple of months ago,
intending to go on to Europe. While in that
9 aarte r he has the job of trying to sell
10,000 more shares in Ocean Oil, Ltd.—pre-
ferably to French people who are interested.
The Ocean Oil bore is down 1103 ft., in “a
conglomeration of blue shale and soft sand-
stone, two samples of which were carefully
tested for paraffin wax. One was proved to
contain 16oz. pure wax per ton and the
other about 80oz., proving the existence of
petroleum.” The co.’s cash account is. get-
ting low; and no expert oil-driller being
available, and Whaley being also absent,
work has been stopped.

The long-standing grievance about the
delay in publishing locally reports of devel-
opments in Westralian mines owned by
Eastern companies was aired by a deputation
to Minister of Mines Robinson at Westonia
the other day. Under the present system
those _ nearest the co.’s Melbourne and
Adelaide offices are, after the directors and
their friends have operated, able to take
advantage of any market movement, whilst
those nearest the mine are left out in the
cold. A Royal Commission many years
ago suggested simultaneous publication,
but so far nothing has been done. Hie
Minister promised to try to overcome the
difficulties in the way of simultaneous post-
ings.

Kalgoorlie was faced with a zinc-shavings
famine a week or two ago. Before the war
Westralia imported its zinc shavings from
all over the world, but some time ago
arrangements were made with the Barrier
to supply the zinc and shave it on the spot.
The usual industrial troubles are said to be
responsible for the shortage.

together with representatives of
the big oil-distributing houses, visited
our mills at Parramatta. All were
unanimous in their opinion that Meggitt’s

than the world’s best, and all assured us
that they would give it their unswerving
support. To-day our output has increased
by 50% above that of 1916. Everyone
should insist on getting Meggitt’s.

Beauty is the outward sign of good health. Good
health is the bodily necessity for beauty.
Not only those who possess classical features are
beautiful. Some women have possessed a feature,
mouth nose or eyes, that was not perfect, and
yet were considered beautiful. Why? Because
they were healthy looking, their skin was clear,
their eyes were bright and their brain was active.

THERE is something most satisfactory about
having on the right shoes for the occa-
sion in hand. One feels comfortable,
smart, confident. And for any and every
occasion nothing could be more suitable or more
charming than patent' leather, which always
looks well and goes so beautifully with every
colour and every fabric. Indeed, this little
shoe here illustrated will add no small share
of smartness and tone to one's spring suit or
summer gown. And it is only one style of
many equally desirable, equally charming. For
Bostock shoes, besides being the last word in
smartness, all have a certain individuality which
sets them apart amongst ready-made shoes,
gives them the personal quality and the dis-
tinctive tone of shoes made specially to measure.

life less

sequent
despair. And all the time a simple remedy
lies at hand in the home. If you have no
cleminite in the house you need only get
about an ounce from your chemist and add
just sufficient water to dissolve it. A little
of this simple lotion is Nature’s own beauti-
fier. It is very good for the skin and in-
stantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lasts all day or evening, renders powder-
ing entirely unnecessary, and absolutely
lefies detection.
COSMETICS can never really help a poor
complexion ; often they are positively
harmful. The sensible, rational way is to
actually remove the thin veil of stifling,
half-dead scarf skin from the face, and give
:he fresh, vigorous and beautiful young skin
underneath a chance to show itself and to
breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way,
by merely applying mercolised wax at night,
like cold cream, and washing it off in the
morning. It absorbs the disfiguring cuticle
gradually and harmlessly, leaving a brilliant
natural complexion. Of course, this also
takes with it all such facial blemishes as
red blotches, tan, moth patches, sallowness,
liver spots, etc. As a freckle remover and
general complexion beautifier this old-
fashioned remedy is unequalled.
BLACKHEADS, oily skins and enlarged
pores usually go together, but can be
instantly corrected by a unique new process.
A tablet of stymol, obtained from the chem-
st’s is dropped in a tumbler of hot water,
which will then of course “fizz” briskly.
Secrets of Beauty
The Cream of Modern Beauty Advice
By “MIMOSA.”
When the effervescence has subsided the face
is bathed with the .stymol-charged water and
then dried with a towel. The offending
blackheads, of their own accord, come right
off on the towel, the large oily pores imme-
diately contract and efface themselves natu-
rally. There is no squeezing, forcing or any
drastic action. The skin is left uninjured,
smooth, soft and cool. A few such treat-
ments should be taken at intervals of three
or four days thereafter in order to ensure
the permanence of the pleasing result so
quickly obtained.

BEAUTIFUL hail- adds immensely to
the personal magnetism of both men
and women. Actresses and smart women
are ever on the look-out for any harmless
thing that wall increase the natural beauty
of their hair. The latest method is to use
pure stallax as a shampoo on account of
the peculiarly glossy, fluffy and wavy effect
which it leaves. As stallax has never been
used much for this purpose it comes to the
chemist only in sealed original packages,
enough for twenty-five or thirty shampoos.
A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax gran-
ules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair, apart
from its beautifying effect.
IT is astonishing the number of women
who suffer from the humiliating afflic-
tion of superfluous hair, and I am sorry to
say that through ignorance or wrong treat-
ment the majority of them have made matters
considerably worse by causing the hairs to
grow more quickly and stronger than before.
It only requires a little thought to realise
the folly of it all. Removing the surface
growth for a few days may give temporary
relief, but in order to obtain permanent
results the hair roots must be killed. Caustic
depilatories are worse than useless, and on
no account should the hairs be pulled out.
Apart from the electric needle, which is a
costly and painful process, any chemist will
tell you that the best home treatment is
pure pow T dered plieminol, which has a de-
vitalising effect upon the hair roots, in addi-
tion to .which it removes all trace of the
objectionable hair in a few seconds, and the
recommended treatment gradually, but
surely, dissolves out the hair follicles, which
is the only method of permanently ridding
oneself of this terrible disfigurement. ,b

J. S. Cockerton: Note your confession that
you don’t know anything about Australian politics.
Tell us: Is the fact that “Mr. Hughes- failed in
attempting to introduce a scheme that was both
desirable and necessary” any reason why he should
be Prime Minister? The trouble is that Mr. Hughes
fails in almost everything—for the simple reason
that he has a kink which seems to compel him to
try to do things in a wrong way. It is a personal,
constitutional failing, just as much his curse before
he went into politics as it has been since. .. .Trooper
J.H.: Both Women ; the brother of one of them was
lately hunting out your way in a colonel's rig.. . .
J. Hay: What in the name of commonsense has the
Australian Federal office-grabbers’ attempt to dis-
franchise Australia for the period of. the war and
six months afterwards got to do with the Sein Fein?
. ...E.M.C.: Thanks.... Adelaide B.: Can’t reprint.
....Prof. Raymond: All right. Professor, if it’s
your line “not only to cure the sick but to regenerate
and consolidate the nation” go right ahead. The

Melos: Why was the cheque returned?. .. .Frank
Fourthestate: It’s a magistrate this time, is it? Last
time it was a colonel, and the Oldest Inhabitant’s
grandfather says it was told about a flogger in the
Navy in Marryatt’s time... .G.O.O.: Hasn’t changed
its mind in the least; but a dead horse won’t pull
you out of the ditch, no matter how you flog him.
That animal is very dead... .J.H.B.: Sorry, can’t
republish. But if you can tell us the date, approxi-
mately, we’ll try to give you a copy E.J.S.: Un-
suitable. .. .M.B.J.: Capital idea; deserves better
treatment. .. .An Adelaides!): Atmosphere admirably
suggested, but dialogue clogged up with literary
affectations. .. .J.L.C.: It’s no use handing white
feathers in poor verse to shirkers... .J.C.S.: The

Forbear them cry in vain,
Or we for so refraining
Deserve the brand of Cain.

To avenge this tvra’- :
Fight till Entente shoulders
Love Peace and Liberty.
....Grace P.: “Mick” just lacks the needful touch
of originality F.L.: Getting weary of “the raging
foani” and “the fray” and “shirk” to rime with
“Turk” and “a mother’s noble son.”. .. .F.C.: The
Belgians have suffered enough. .. .M.T.: Futile....
Ethel Jay: Interesting, but too hummocky.... D.L.S. :
Nearly bad enough to be good enough to print....
Rex A.: Trivial incident out of which you have
failed to make a story.... K.M.D.: Sentiment all
right, but poorly expressed... .P.-J. FiIdes’: “Same as
You'’ appears in “Bells and Hobbles,” by E. J.
Bradv, any bookseller.... A. Mclnnes: (1) Australian
Authors and Writers’ Guild was founded in Melb.
Write Vance Palmer, Emerald (Vic.) ... .R.G.L.:
Stacpoole was born in the United Kingdom; he has
not, as far as we can remember, ever been a con-
tributor to The B. Judging by the mistakes he makes
in his description of Sydney in his novel, “The Reef
of Stars,” he has never been in Australia.... Nemo:
You “hope one or two paragraphs will be acceptable.”
Now, as one pressman to another, would you accept
any of them yourself? If writing’s your trade, don't
produce riddles —write to be read and be done with
it. .. .A.H.M.: Sorry to do you an injustice, but you
lay yourself open to suspicion when you write in
negro dialect for an Australian audience, on a
model that is original to you but is common in the
U.S.A. periodical press. Let’s see some more of
your work, written in good Australian. .. .C.L.: War
won’t quite work. ... S.W.: You’ve a long way to
travel yet. . . .F.T.: “Theresa” is a-feeble damsel. ...
Danstewer: It doesn’t grip, though there’s a hint of
force in it. .. .C.V.B.: Seems to be an insane jumble
of words... .Soma: Not quite. The idea is good, but
the treatment commonplace.... Olive: The miles have
it....E.L.: That’s a dreary item.... Block 10: Too
obvious. .. .H.W.S.: It looks quite simple, almost
as simple as perpetual motion or the discovery of a
gold mine; but it doesn’t make a yarn.... A.B.C. :
“Waiting Woman” has some heart-call in it, but
not our style.... H.P.: Do they sow their seed in
harvest-time at Ironbark ?. .. .Iloply : What, a miser-
able philosophy... .B.C.: There’s a dreadful mono-
tony about the lines. ... A.G.V.: Heaven forgive you.
Look at one stanza in print and perspire :—
A few days more and we’re at Auckland,
Then to Wellington by train.
A passenger later on the Wimmera I stand,
Bound for dear old Melbourne again.
.. . .E.L.S.: Dreary verse and confused thought....
Artisan: Where is the humor you threaten?....
Lizard: You’re not the “Lizard” we know. He can
write:.. .K.G.: Yes; but why ask a question like
that? Read the paper and find out. “The Lovers”
don’t appeal... .ILL.: There’s an idea there in hang-
ing- the refrain of a love tragedy on to the noises
of the trams; but the verse is clumsy. Get to it
again... .M.:' You must improve your verses some
more. .. .F.X.: Not bp. . . .K.W.H.: It wants a large-
sized poet’s license to say a thing “ ’gan to com-
mence”. .. .C.S.: Not enough story . .. .IJ.B.: “Dawn”
just misses. .. .Siri: Verse not up. Sketch not our
style, but well enough done. .. .S.J.J.F. (or some-
thing like that): Verses don't strike us K.G.:
“Drunk” makes an heroic effort to be clever—and
shows it all the way... .II.A.G.: The verses bump
arid wallow sadly, but there’s an idea.... Waterloo
Jim: Poor theme; poor verse... .W.R.C.: Can’t find
anything about it that “rings true”... . Q.Q.; The
racing yarn hasn’t the smell of horse about it.
Might make a smart paragraph if boiled down.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E.T.: No need to explain that you’re only a
beginner. But it’s better for you to draw like that
as a beginner than as a finisher.

Commenting - on a cabled report that
Warrant-Officer McGrath, M.II.R. for Bal-
larat, has been advising Billjims overseas to
vote for Labor, G. F. Pearce remarked
severely: “Mr. McGrath was sent to Europe
to fight the Germans, not to engage in
political warfare.” Pearce might also have
mentioned that Bean was sent away as a
war correspondent, not as a political agent.
But. somehow, lie didn’t say a word about
that.

AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORT.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 20 of the Commonwealth Bank Act, 1911, I
have to report that the Aggregate Balance sheet of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia for the
half-year ended 31st December, 1916, has been examined by officers under my direction, as well
as by myself. The several items of the account, as above set forth, have been verified with the
book and vouchers, with the Securities held by the Bank, and with Statements certified by the
respective Managers and Accountants of the Bank.
I have obtained all the information and explanations required by me. The said Balance Sheet
has been prepared in the form prescribed by the Regulations under the Act, and, in my opinion, it
exhibits a correct view of the affairs of the Bank.

IN
BANANA LAND
While the Barron River was in flood a
week or two ago a gin went along about
dusk for some water, when a croc, put up
his nose and grabbed liar by the arm. Her
yells brought the camp., abos. on the run,
but they were just too late, as the woman
had lost an ai'm and a slice of her side.
She died the next night. A few hours later
two stockmen, unaware of the incident,
swam their horses across the same spot to
lift a small mob of cattle. They did not run
the blockade on the return journey, taking,
instead, a nine-mile track to the bridge. A
couple of years ago a Cairns policeman was
snapped at the same spot, his body being dis-
covered next day stuck in the mud at the
bottom of the river higher up. The croc,
always postpones the banquet for 24 hours,
but patrols the neighborhood to keep off
thieves.
When the ketch Warrigal lumbered into
Rockhampton the other day a tired crew
.heaved a sigh of relief. Owned by the Aus-
tralian Distillery Co., of Melbourne, the
Warrigal loaded molasses at Mackay. Com-
ing south she ran into a heavy storm, and
the gas generated by the molasses simply had
to find an outlet. The bulkheads presented
the most vulnerable spot, and a surprised
crew' thought they had run into a Hun
mine. There was nothing to do but strategi-
cally retire to the nearest port for repairs.
From Thursday Island :
With the beaching of the schooner Tarawa for
breaking-up purposes the last of the floating stations
of the Torres Strait pearling fleets recently disap-
peared. Until a few years ago, each fleet of luggers
was accompanied to sea by a parent vessel—usually
a schooner of about 150 tons—which acted as a kind
of flagship. ' In those days the method of working
the pearling industry was for each lugger to send its
catch every day to the schooner, where the shells
were opened and cleaned and any pearls extracted
under the supervision of a white overseer. The idea
was to prevent the colored lugger-crews sneaking
the shell or forgetting to report the pearl. The
schooners kept the smaller craft in rations, water and
diving and sailing gear, and so enabled them to remain
at sea for longer periods than if they had to return
lo port for their requirements. A wealth of tragedy
and romance is associated with the names of some of
these schooners. There was the Alice, a graceful
vessel that for years shepherded her fleet over the
reef-strewn waters of Torres Strait, adventured along
the little-known coast of Dutch New Quinea and
cruised in the Aru Islands. She lost herself and 13
of her crew at dusk one evening - on a reef en route
from the Dutch Islands to Broome (IV.A.). There
was the fast Maoriland fore-an’-after Three Cheers, a
craft of many adventures, now degenerated into a
mere hulk; the Sagitta, which was lost with all
hands in the cyclone at Capo Melville, on‘ the N.Q.
coast, nearly 19 years ago—a storm whose violence
is evidenced to this day by rusting chain-plates,
anchor cables and winches of wrecked vessels lying
on top of the cliffs 80 feet high-water mark.
There were the numerous Bells, whose owner
named each of his successive schooners after himself;
the ex-black-birder Meg Merrilees, whose hold was
full of ghosts; the William Fairbairn, which when
lying ashore near Hammond Island was sold for ;C5
and mysteriously refloated a day or tv - o later in
good trim ; the mission vessel Dayspring, which after
years of hunting the Devil in the South Seas took on
the pursuit of the pearl oyster in Torres Strait; and
there was the curious Hermaphrodite, so named be-
cause of her freakish rig. With the abandonment of
the floating-station idea the schooners have all gone.
The luggers put to sea on their own nowadays, the
divers getting so much a ton for the shell and keep-
ing the pearls as bunco.
They still know how to exchange delicate
compliments Out West. “I desire to welcome
our new member,” said the president of the
Longreach Shire Council lately. The new
member begged them not to waste time—lie
knew lie wasn’t wanted. “You’re quite
right,” remarked a brother-councillor cheer-
fully. “ You don’t come here to assist the
ratepayers,” the new man retorted in a spirit
of beautiful candor. “You’re a liar,” said the
old hand. “And you’re a ——• liar, a
——-liar,” said the new one with great cheer-
fulness. It looks almost as though that shire
council might become personal presently.
The Fortress and the Fence.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
About my garden there is run
A little picket fence,
So low it is and tendril-spun
’Tis more like a pretence.
And there I tend my humble herbs,
My mint and rosemary,
And lavender that Folly curbs
With grey simplicity ;
Distilling from my sage and thyme
A julen innocent,
1 mix myself a drink sublime
Of peaceful memories blent.
You have a fortress grey and cold,
Portcullis always down,
And bastions where no mosses fold,
And many towers that frown.
Yet Sometimes on a golden eve
A postern gate swings wide,
And dreading—longing—eyes perceive
A garden’s green inside.
And to the evening’s, board is borne
Each summer draught that Hows —
Mead from a honeysuckle horn,
And red wines of the rose.
And then my garden wall assumes
A granite barrier high,
To prison in my temperate blooms
From your cup’s witchery.
And plaited close, the tendrils turn
A maze for my defence.
Till mine is now the fortress stern
And yours the little fence!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 31, 1917.
My Dear Thabgomindah,—
Home-secretary Huxham has just received
word that his only son has been severely
wounded in France; and Charles Collins,
M.L.A. for Bowen, was notified that his son
had been killed in action. Much brighter
news came to Minister for Agriculture Len-
non. His son, Lieut. Austin, has gained a
ONE COMFORT.
BARBER (consolingly, after clipping off half his victim's ear ): “Ah, well, sir, there's
one comfort —you can only lose ’em once.”
bar for his Military Cross. This old
Northerner has two other sous in khaki.
Killed in action in France, E. W. Burnett
Hooper, of Kootchie, eldest son of the presi-
dent of the Graziers’ Association. Burnett
Hooper, who was 26, was a fine type of Aus-
tralian, fearless, straight, one of the best
of Western horsemen and a fine shot. After
putting on khaki he went first to Egypt, and
from there to France as a dispatch-rider.
Brisbane is trying to overcome the habit
of blushing in the belief that the Firm’s
Easter offering, “Fair and Warmer,” will be
too naughty for anything. Meanwhile we
have to be content with giggling at Dame
Dan Thomas at the Empire. Douglas Fair-
banks takes a flying leap into the box-office
at the Majestic, where Australian Enid
Bennett is making her first film-appearance.
For the rest we are mostly saving up for
a wild orgy on “Intolerance.”
“Bertie” Darley, of Salisbury Plains, one
of the most popular squatters of the district,
and always well to the fore at Rockhampton
Shows and race meetings, was in England
just before the Big Struggle started and got
a commission in the R.F.A. For months
and months he was kept at the stodgy busi-
ness of “Home Defence.” Being a son of
that fine old Irishman N.S.W. Chief Justice
Frederick Darley, and one of the numerous
nephews of the late Sylvester Browne, of
Minimbah, he is a “born fighter,” and quickly
got fed up with his dull job. After much
trouble, he managed to exchange into a bat-
talion which was on the eve of sailing for
the Front, and is now having the time of his
1 ife.
Some stupid woman put this note into a
pair of socks recently unpacked at the
Front
The sender hopes that a soldier in France will
receive these socks, and not a cold-footer in Egypt.
The sweating desert fighter who drew the
insult in a Red Cross distribution raised a
sandstorm with his speech of acknowledg-
ment. The Red Cross should pass the word
to its packers to keep an eye lifting for such
stupidities.
Everyone who owns a fruit tree of any
kind in Queensland is turned into an orchard-
ist. The magic wand is the amended Dis-
eases in Plants Act, Which requires < all who
own one or more fruit trees to register the
fact with the Agricultural Department. The
system of registration has produced such a
rush of people that the Department may
have to increase its staff; and that and the
number of diseased trees that will have to
be cut down look like a solution of the un-
employment problem.
Xhe long ears of the law protruded again
the other day when a foster-mother was
before the Brisbane Summons Court on a
charge of having ill-treated an adopted two-
year-old child. Neighbors had heard the
child continually screaming, and the medical
evidence put before the magistrate showed
that the helpless infant was practically
covered with bruises. For this sustained
cruelty a fine of £B, in default two months,
was all that was handed out!
If Brisbane Daily Mail gets through it
won’t be because all hands have pulled to-
gether. There are only three proprietors—
John Wren, J. B. Sharpe and a big Mel-
bourne shopkeeper—but they manage to
occupy three separate camps. The quarrel
between them poked a nose into a court in
Brisbane the other day, Sharpe asking for
an order to restrain John from doing some-
thing or other ; but he pulled back before the
reptile contemporary had a chance to make
much copy out of it.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Laura Duncan, of Mooraberrie station,
near Windorah, has obtained a verdict for
£2900 against the Bananaland Government
in the stock embargo case. Mrs. Duncan
claimed £5OOO for the seizure of a mob of
cattle by the Government under the stock-
embargo proclamation, which prohibited
Queensland cattle crossing into other States.
The acquisition was first authorised under
the Meat for Imperial Uses Act of 1914, but
subsequently, when the High Court decided
that the corresponding Act in N. S. Wales
was invalid, a further proclamation was
issued under the Sugar Acquisition Act of
1915, the provisions of which had been ex-
tended to cover live-stock. The hearing of
the case was notable for the pepper put into
it by Chief Justice Pope Cooper, who plainly
doesn’t think much of Ryan as Attorney-
General. This, however, is only the first,
round, as appeals will be taken right up to
the Privy Council.
“Eta” : Brisbane General Hospital is in
a bad way financially. The trouble is
that the show has always been run on pub-
lic subscriptions plus a Government subsidy
of £2 for £1; and as contributions have fallen
off on account of war collections, the com-
mittee was faced at the end of March with
an overdraft of £9842, whilst a further £lOOO.
was required immediately. In the meantime
the endowment up till June next had been
drawn. Then the bank shut down and there
was chaos; so the committee gave up its
job, thus forcing the Government to take
control. No doubt some of the unpleassint-
ness could have been averted if the rival
politicians, had not been so ready to
seize upon the business for party, purposes.
A great deal of the blame, however, attaches
to the Leg. Council, which rejected the Hos-
pitals Bill—a measure that would have
enabled the Government to straighten mat-
ters out to some extent.
“Politicus” : The sensation of the day in
Queensland is the turning down of John
Adamson as candidate for the Senate in
the Huglies-Cook interest and the adoption
of Foil, of the Returned Soldiers and Patri-
ots’ League. Foil was wounded at Gallipoli
some 18 months ago and acted as Adamson’s
secretary when John was Minister for Rail-
ways. Reid and Crawford are both well-
known Bananalanders, the former having
headed the extreme Trades Hall section
against the Moderates who defected some 10
years ago, while Crawford was once of some
importance in typographical associations.
For a number of years he has been an active
figure among cane-growers in N.Q. and is at
present President of the Sugar Producers’
Association.
There’s some talk of John Adamson, who
was the first victim to be squeezed by the
Phewsion machine, running as an Indepen-
dent candidate for the Senate. Of the three
selected Phewsionists none is represen-
tative of the Central District, and if Adam-
son decides to stand, he will secure big sup-
port on the “local” ticket. But in the end he
will most likely decide not to. It is prac-
tically hopeless in these days for any man to
get to the National Parliament unless he
can. wheedle or smoodge the support of one
junta or the other.

Studebaker—another name for
LUXURY in cars.
Famous as Studebaker is for its efficiency, coupled with
exceptional economy and low cost of maintenance —and
famous as Studebaker is for reliability and safety and ease of
operation —it is no less celebrated for the luxury and comforts
that result from Studebaker’s years of successful experience
in producing vehicles.
Stuclebaker is simply another
name for practical Luxury
in a motor-car. The owner
of a Stuclebaker can well take
pride in its handsome appear-
ance and comfort-producing
appointments. Its fine body
finish, easy riding springs,
deep upholstery, tilted seats
and roominess of compart-
ments offers a combination of
conveniences that are not
surpassed in any car sold
within from ioo to i5O
of its price. You will find

Actress Tells Secret
A Well-known Actress Tells How She
Darkened Her Grey Hair with a
Simple Home-made Mixture.
Miss Blanche Rose, a well-known actress,
who darkened her grey hair with a simple
preparation which she mixed at home, in a
recent interview made the following state-
ment: “Any lady or gentleman can darken
their grey hair and make it soft and glossy
with this simple recipe, which they can mix
at home. To a half-pint of water add loz.
of bay rum and a small box of Orlex Com-
pound. These ingredients can be' bought at
any chemist’s at very little cost. Apply to
the hair twice a week until it becomes the
required shade. This will make a grey-
haired person look 20 years younger. It is
also fine to promote the growth of hair, and
relieves itching and dandruff.” — Advt. [1

cable to some Vic. suburban lines! : A com-
partment reserved for males in which men

How surely some of the fellows at the
Front do reach the spot! A field-ambulance
officer, writing to The Bulletin to tell of
the death of two Duntroon lads who had
stuck it with the guns for 13 weeks
without a break, adds just these two lines
of comment: “They wouldn’t have been killed
if they hadn’t deserved so entirely to live.”
The first Tasmanian member of the A.I.F.
to win the V.O. was Captain 11. A'. Murray,
born and bred in Launceston (Tas.), though
he enlisted in W.A. He got the decoration
for leading a successful attack on a German
position, holding it against three heavy
counter-attacks, and showing what is offici-
ally described as “great skill, gallantry” and
“magnificent example.” Maybe that is where
Rudolph the Ready got his inspiration.
“Sandy”: Give Capt. IV. T. Coudor some
of the credit for the good work done at the
V.D. camp in Victoria. Cornier is a young
Tasmanian who was knocked out in the
Landing and came back with a useless right
arm—hard luck for a good footballer,
sprinter and boxer. First, lie was adjutant
to Major Blezzard, then in charge of the
V.D. camp. After he had done much excel-
lent work, D.11.Q. transferred him to Broad-
meadows. Within a fortnight he was back,
this time as C.O. Since then he has been
working like h—l to make the place as much
like li —n as possible; and the boys appreci-
ate it.
Drawn his last plan, at 68, W. H. Hunter,
the engineer of the Manchester Ship Canal.
In 1912 the Launceston Marine Board im-
ported him to advise on a scheme of river
improvements. He spent a couple of months
in Tasmania and drew up plans for a scheme
costing the better part of five millions. So
far, about half the money has been sunk in
the ooze, and there is very little to show for
it except a p.n.
John Fell, an Australian War Chest
worker, has made a battlefield reputation of
his own. Recently while some Kangaroos
were just cooling down after chasing the
Huns out of a German trench, the hot coffee
arrived in charge of Fell. Billjim reckons
a dinkum bloke who does things like that
deserves honorable mention in dispatches.
“Billy Blue” : Gone to have a look at his
last balance-sheet, W. H. Cordeaux, for the
past 30 years manager of the Bathurst-
street branch of the Commercial Bank
of Sydney. Grandfather William Cor-
deaux was one of the pioneers who
were attracted to N. S. Wales in the
’2o’s by the pastoral outlook opened up by
the early explorers. On arrival he was
appointed one of the first commissioners for
Crown lands, but resigned to take up coun-
try on his own behalf. He first obtained a
grant of 700 acres in the parish of Minto.
County of Cumberland, and later went out
to the back of Berrima. The family settled
there, and some of them are there still. The
name you’ll find in several places on the
map of N. S. Wales.
The Yankees have been experimenting
with submarines, and Land, naval construc-
tor, who was put on to the job, reported
thus: —
The ideal boat would be one of between 700 and
900 tons displacement, and from 225 ft. to 250 ft.
long'. A submarine of that size would be capable of
keeping the sea and of manoeuvring with a fleet.
Anything larger, say, 300 ft. to 400 ft. long, would be
too slow in submerging, and might descend to danger-
ous depths.
The one thing the expert didn't mention was
how many notes the craft would cost.
G. P. Kerrison, of Bega (N.S.W.), who
died the other day, was born in Suffolk 02
years ago, and was one of the first to take
up land on the far South Coast of the Ma
State. He founded the Bega Show nearly
half a century ago, and was its president for
over 30 years; and he was also founder and
president of the local hospital. On his farm
he bred some of the bluest blood to be found
in the Jersey herd-book.
“Globe” : The Defence Department puts a
low value on women’s services. Privates
on units of hospital ships get only a few
pence per day less than fully-qualified nurses:
corporals and sergeants nearly twice as
much. Yet the men take their orders from
the nurses, who are always in charge of the
wards. The masseuse on one of our ships
gets 7s. daily; the masseur ranks as stan-
sergeant, which means 12s. fid. per day. She
is certificated and experienced; he is uncer-
tificated, and previous to his appointment
all his experience and knowledge of the pro-
fession was crammed into him in three
months' training by the military in Mel-
bourne.
“J.F.H.” (London) : This is another way
to win the war. Sir Sidney Lee wants the
British public to stump .up £5OOO to buy
volumes of Shakspeare for your Billjims.
Sir Sidney, who was born Levi and baptised
Solomon Lazarus, is the greatest living
authority on the Bard. He runs the “Kit-
chener Souvenir Committee of the League of
the Empire,” and proposes to present every
Australian soldier permanently disabled with
a specially-bound copy of the Divine Wil-
liam, the volume to have a book-plate and
a lithographed letter proclaiming that it is
an “expression of the sympathy and grati-
tude of the Empire and the Nation.” Sir
Sidney is confident that the book will become
a “treasured heirloom in many Australian
homes.” He explains that the reason why
-Shakspeare was chosen by his Souvenir
Committee is that the works of \\ illiam
“elevate and cheer the mind and heart, be-
sides enforcing the highest lessons of patri-
otism - and serving effectively to strengthen
the sense of corporate unity among the com-
ponent parts of the British Empire.’ That’s
the beauty of old Shak. It doesn t matter
that there was no British Empire when he
was writing his plays. With no trouble at
all any properly constituted Shaksociety
could prove that a knowledge of “The Tem-
pest” is a great help to a mine-sweeper out
on the North Sea looking for German mines.

wrong? It is you that is “wrong,” and it
is your liver that has the grudge against
you—possibly because you are not treat-
ing it well. You have given it too much
work to do. and when it wanted a gentle
laxative to set it right you neglected to
attend to it. To set your liver right, to
make things go well, and to make your-
self feel good all over, take a course of
Chamberlain’s Tablets and you will be
more than pleased with the result. Cham-
berlain’s Tablets are unsurpassed for
irritability.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are purely vege-
table, and contain no ingredient that
can in any way be injurious to the most
delicate person. Their action is mild and
gentle, without any of the painful sensa-
tions experienced by the use of pills.
Chamberlain’s Tablets act as a tonic,
strengthen the system and assist the
natural movement of the bowels.
The most common cause of constipa-
tion is a lack of exercise necessary to
keep the muscles of the bowels active.
That is “why constipation is often brought
on by too frequent use of purgatives.
They act violently, performing the work
of the bowels for them, and so weaken
them that they will not act without
assistance. Chamberlain’s Tablets will
cure constipation because, instead of
doing the work of the bowels, they gently
stimulate them to voluntary action.
Their frequent use will not injure the
most delicate person.
Indigestion means imperfect nourish-
ment, and that means poor health. In
these days of strenuous competition it is
the healthy man who wins. Nothing
equals Chamberlain’s Tablets for clearing
the stomach of undigested food and pro-
moting a flow of gastric juices which are
indispensable in the process of digestion.
Indigestion always produces a tendency
to constipation, and for this alone Cham-
berlain’s Tablets are invaluable.
DO NOT BE BEHIND THE TIMES,
but move with them. Salts, castor-oil
and harsh purgatives are out of date,
and have been the cause of many a case
of constipation. Chamberlain’s Tablets
are the medicine that you want to take.
They cure constipation, indigestion, bili-
ousness, and cure them permanently.
Remember the name—Chamberlain’s
Tablets—and be sure you get them, for
there is nothing “just as good.”
NEVER FORGET that upon your
physical condition depends your comfort
and usefulness. That your condition will
be bettered, your figure increased, when
your bowels are regulated, your liver
stimulated and your digestion made
sound by taking Chamberlain’s Tablets
for the stomach and liver.
The old saying, “Coming events cast
their shadows before.” is especially true
of a bilious attack. You will have warn-
ing of its approach. Your appetite will
fail, you will feel dull and languid and
have a feeling of nausea. As soon as any
of these symptoms appear take three of
Chamberlain’s Tablets and the attack
may be warded off. By taking a course
of Chamberlain’s Tablets you will be
permanently relieved of all bilious ten-
dencies.
When the liver and bowels don’t act,
life is a failure. Chamberlain’s Tablets
wake these drowsy organs, like the sun
wakes the earth, and the whole body
laughs. It is fun to live when the body
is in good trim, but it is never so when
the liver and bow r els shirk duty. There
is more happiness in a Is. 6d. box of
Chamberlain’s Tablets than you ever
dreamed of. They stimulate the nervous
system and make you feel young again.

"TABLETS -
Old age should be made a period of happiness-
but strict attention to health is necessary
As age advances the stomach and
bowel muscles lose their elasticity and
no longer respond readily, .while the
liver does not store up the juices that
are necessary to prompt digestion. The
result is constipation, dyspepsia, bilious-
ness, sour stomach, bloating, drowsiness
after eating, belching, headache and
frequently weakness from want of
assimilation of food, which mean un-
happiness at any age.
The use of harsh cathartics aggravates
the. trouble and makes constipation
worse, the bowels soon becoming
unable to perform their own functions
without the aid of drastic purgatives.
Chamberlains Tablets are without
doubt Australasia’s greatest household
remedy. Their mild and gentle action
recommends them especially for women
and old folks, who should never take
drastic cathartics and purgatives such as
pills, powders, salt waters, etc.
For old and young, the strong and
the weak, there is no laxative that
equals
CnAMBEfiLAINSTABLEIS
Jt»- the Stomach o Livers
By allowing yourself to become consti-
pated you are slowly and surely poisoning
yourself. When the bowels perform
their work they expel all poisonous mat-
ter, but when you allow yourself to
become constipated you absorb all this
poison into your system, thus laying the
seeds of many diseases. Some of the
signs of self-poisoning are headache, back-
ache, languidness, weariness, melancholy,
furred tongue, pasty complexion, loss of
appetite, etc. The safest antidote to such
poison is Chamberlain’s Tablets. These
Tablets stimulate the liver and bowels to
act naturally and gently. Tn doing so
they cleanse the stomach and purify the
blood.
NO, NEVER ! A man with a healthy
liver does not contract diseases. During
recent epidemics in various parts of the
world thousands of people protected them-
selves by keeping their livers healthy and
active by the use of Chamberlain’s Tab-
lets.
When the food leaves the stomach
without having gone through the requisite
process, as happens in cases of indiges-
tion, it is impossible for the liver to com-
plete the work. Therefore, look to your
stomach—strengthen and stimulate it to
perform its functions. There is no better
medicine for this than Chamberlain’s
Tablets. Chamberlain’s Tablets will
cleanse your stomach of all undigested
food and restore it to a healthy condi-
tion.
If your liver is sluggish and out of
tone, and you feel dull, bilious, consti-
pated, take a dose of Chamberlain's
Tablets to-night before retiring, and you
will feel all right in the morning.

His Master’s Voice

Read what Shackleton thinks of “His Master’s Voice”
Instruments.
For the two years he and his party were isolated in
the Antarctic Regions the Gramophone provided a fund
of entertainment.
Wellington, New Zealand, Bth March, 1917.
Dear Sir, —
In answer to yours, the Gramophone was of the greatest use and
pleasure to everyone during the long winter months spent in the
Antarctic, cut off, as we were, from all social amenities, With only
the squawk of the penguin and the roar of the blizzard for diversity
of sound.
I think that no Expedition should go to the Antarctic without
“His Master’s Voice” Gramophone, for it certainly bridges the miles
of stormy ocean that lie between the Antarctic and civilisation.
Believe me, Dear Sirs,
Yours truly, ' .

Wherever you go “His Master’s Voice” is popular—because it is the BEST.

Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease. In
Anaemia—or bloodlessness—
the red corpuscles are more
or less deficient. Thus the
blood cannot provide suffi-
cient nourishment for the
body. Therefore the face
becomes white and “ pasty ”
the eyes become dull and
“heavy”—and a feeling of
intense weariness pervades
the whole system. To over-
come Anaemia, the blood
supply needs recharging with
red corpuscles. And it is
here that

'J'HE BLOOD is the energiser of the system. Upon its quality
depends the nourishment of every organ, every nerve-centre,
every muscle of the body.
Poorness of Blood is called Anaemia — girls, women and men
are all subject to it.
It manifests itself in breathlessness on slight exertion, pale
cheeks, lustreless eyes, depression and exhaustion.
If you have any of these symptoms, or are run-down and need
a tonic, take Iron ‘Jelloids’ to enrich the blood.
When the blood has been enriched and strengthened, Anaemia
is overcome —the symptoms give place to abundant vitality, rosy
cheeks, and a feeling of general "fitness" and well-being.

The Inky Way.
Adelaide’s Labor daily, the Herald, has
never had what could be called a bed of
roses, and latterly its position has been plain
Hades. At one of the-biggest meetings of
Labor ever held in Adelaide, Kneebone, the
latest of many editors the paper has had.
announced plaintively that lately he had had
to either be untrue to Labor principles as he
sees them, or simply disobey the Board which,
■having charge of the paper, is his boss; and
he had chosen to do the latter. The trouble
is that the Board is made up of four who
follow Lundie and the U.L.P. and five who
follow the new “National” party which is
coquetting with the Liberals. The main
question was his refusal to acknowledge in
The Herald subscriptions sent in to the
latter lot, who still hold Ministerial office;
and a noisy meeting finally endorsed his
action by a big majority.
* * * *
The Coalition seems to be demoralising
even the linotype. A Maoriland paper told
the public the other day :
A man named Joseph Cook, charged to-day with
riotous conduct, informed the Court that he only
wanted to win the war. The accusheged was re-
manded for medical treatment.
Still it might have done better and said that
Joe was achughesed.

“Vic.”: Wilson, the £140,000 benefactor
of Melbourne Hospital, whose memorial tab-
let has just been unveiled, was in occupation
of a Dandenong farm when he started writ-
ing letters to the Argus, attacking Governor
Latrobe. They led to liis buying the paper
in partnership with Johnston for only £350.
The Mackinnon interest came in later. Wil-
son’s writing was decidedly sloppy and
scrappy, as I find on reference. But he had
the business head that pays better than
style. His persistent assaults on the Gov-
ernment made him the democratic champion,
and helped him to collar from the Herald,
the tremendously profitable advts. of the
Goldfields rush. The Argus had a full head
of steam up when the Age started in Decem-
ber, ’54. Higinbotham succeeded Wilson as
editor. Alas that they lost him after only
nine months!
“Spasmode” : Two Australian country edi-
tors of my acquaintance were always play-
ing Potts and Slurk to a delighted town.
Potts wrote: “We must apologise for any
shortcomings, having been our own editor, sub-
editor. reporter, canvasser, compositor, printer
and reader this issue.” Slurk wrote : “Very
hard, after all this, for him to be the only
reader !” Then Potts waited. Slurk was a care-
less writer. He wrote of the Agricultural Show
banquet: “The Press was drunk, and the
Ladies was drunk.” Potts chipped in with :
“Not having been there Ourselves, we can
understand that the Press was drunk, but
for his libel, on the Ladies Slurk ought to
be pitched into the river.”
Bananaland inkywayfarers are still swap-
ping the pen for the bomb. Latest recruits
are Frank Brewer (grandson of an old Syd-
ney pressman), who worked for the Tele-
graph (Brisbane), and George Parker,
of the Maekay Standard. Over a dozen
members of the Queensland district of the
A.J.A. are in khaki. Brewer is the third
and last son of the family to enlist.

“Black-and-Whiter”: George Dancey, of
Melbourne Paunch, is the one man among
Australian cartoonists who sternly refuses to
keep abreast of the times. The other day he
was instructed to boil Hughes over a pic-
torial fire fed by Tudor, Higgs and O’Malley,
and he characteristically declined to give
Higgs a shave. Higgs parted with his
whiskers years ago, but the news of the
divorce won’t reach Dancey for a long
while yet. It is George’s lack of common
knowledge—he is well-versed in strange and
recondite subjects—that makes his work so
fascinating. Some time back he had to
allegorise the triumph of Britain in a boat-
race, and lie represented each rower pulling
Iwo oars. George did not fasten the rudder
on the bows; but I'm sure he would if he
had thought of it.
“Trallwm”: In old Madrid there is a
“Mater Dolorosa” world-known for the poig-
nancy of its expression of surprise and
anguish. The artist is said to have obtained
this effect by suddenly accusing his wife of
a dreadful and unnatural crime. This week
I saw that expression in all its poignancy
cross the faces of seven city fathers—staid
.T’s.P., deacons most of them, and the “Pro-
Bono Publico” of many a letter “to the
press.” A few issues ago The Bulletin let
in a little “inside” light on the methods of
the great military Boojum. Local Brass-
hattery couldn’t refute the statements
because they were so true; nevertheless, yelp-
ing “personal enmity” and “prejudice to re-
cruiting,” it sought to smell out the man who
knew too much. It found him, so it thought,
in the local recruiting committee, and forth-
with taxed those placid, kindly Cheerybles
with —hold tight!— writing for The Bul-
ietin! The first agonising shock survived.
Respectability gasped out that it hadn’t, and
made a beeline for the nearest shop to buy
the rag. ... Someone had at last said what
they had been thinking for months!
THE PERFECT RHYME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, to have lived in Sicily with von
And sweet Theocritus when song was young,
And every happy flower the morning swung
Was ripe with melody of odorous dew !
There, ’neath the boughs, you might have sung full
true
With those rare voices grassy Aetna flung
Down to a shore that lapped with lyric tongue
A singing shore enamored of its blue.
O love, I dream! Our married glances meet,
Our mouths make idylls all the gloaming through.
Here o’er our heads the breathing blossoms twine
And couplets cluster at our naked feet;
Nor ever poet since the first pipe blew
Dreamed such a rhyme as your lips make on mine.

The True Safeguard
of Baby’s Health
Allenburgs Foods
THE milk of a healthy mother confers a de-
gree of immunity to infection to the young
infant. Many mothers, however, though
willing, cannot nurse their babies for various
reasons. In such cases the greatest care should
be taken in selecting a proper substitute. Ordi-
nary cow’s milk cannot be regarded as a safe
food for infants; it is acid, contains indigestible
curd, and is almost invariably contaminated
with harmful germs. By using the “Allenburys”
Foods, which are free from all dangerous
organisms, and effectually replace human
milk, security for baby is ensured and vigorous
growth and health are promoted. The
“Allenburys” Foods are largely used and
recommended by the Medical and Nursing
Professions; they have stood the test of time
and have become a household necessity all
over the world.

The Case of Isabel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE bumped the island in the afternoon,
A pleasant place of trees and rust-
ling fern
Round which the blue sea made a pleasant
' tune,
O'er which the pale sky seemed in warmth
to yearn.
I raised my head. I sprang upon my feet.
•Land! Land 1” I cried and thought of
things to eat.
Jones stirred and Murphy on his elbow rose.
The raft was steadfast in the yellow sand,
The happy shore-smell touched my willing
nose,
The sleepy shore-breeze all my whiskers
fanned.
We had arrived. I raised my happy cry
And waded in to find a small world dry.
Not altogether dry. A little creek
Of sparkling water ran to meet the sea,
Dimpling through fern and playing liide-
-1 and-seek
About the tangled roots of bush and tree.
Murphy and Jones were following my lead,
Both wondering if the island held a feed.
For sixteen days we. had been drifting wide
On the broad bosom of a sleepy sea,
.Moved by thin currents and a lazy tide
To front these shores of summer destiny,
Because the ship we voyaged in had been
Turned to scrap-iron by a submarine.
We nearly died, or nearly thought we did,
Chewing hard biscuit weary hour on hour.
The sun upon the water-cask’s hot lid
►Shone day on day with all its fervid power,
As, lying prone upon a heaving plank,
The dreary fluid of despair we drank.
Now all was changed. A full brown cocoa-
nut
Dropt from a laden palm-tree at our feet.
Across the isle we took the shortest cut
And found bananas ripe and fit to eat.
And, almost ere we paused to gorge and
gloat,
We heard the bleating of a happy goat.
Goat and banana made the whole world kind
And cocoanuts gave life a rosy tint.
The war might do its worst. We did not
mind.
Here there was food and water without
stint; »
And we could sleep all day in shadows green
Heedless of mine and prowling submarine.
Here enters Isabel. Her hair was red.
Her home was in the island’s only cave,
Set in high rocks whence a small footpath led
To where she bathed at morning in the wave.
She also was a simple refugee,
Survivor of a vessel split at sea.
I found her first, and therefore she was mine.
While Jones and Murphy slept I took my
way
Through tangled fern and twisted hanging-
vine
To one small bower where all the world was
gay.
For Isabel was all the world to me,
Set between goats, bananas and the sea.
I kept her secret. Jones, I told her oft,
Hated all women. Murphy drank and swore.
And both of them were beefy, large and soft,
Doing naught else all day but eat and snore.
Both beat their wives; and both, I could
not fail
To tell her, had spent several years in jail.
Therefore she loved me for my own sweet
sake,
For there was no one else to love around.
’Twas joy her pink hands in my own to take
And see her rippling, rosy locks unbound,
The while she fondled near her sheltering
cave
The growing whiskers that I could not
shave.
\ud Jones and Murphy really were asleep,
Except when they were busy swapping lies ;
And each of them was fa,t, a shaking heap
Of utter flesh devoid of enterprise.
1 caught them goat for breakfast, lunch and
tea
And Isabel by right belonged to me.
A month went by and then we spied a sail—
Or rather funnel—creeping up the world.
We made a signal smoke that, blue and pale,
Above the island herbage lightly curled;
And Jones stood up and wildly waved his
coat
L’ntil we saw the ship put off a boat.
I ran to Isabel. We clung and kist.
Her tresses made a glory round her head.
I held her softly by each yielding wrist —
“When we get out of this we must be wed.”
She laughed —a gurgle like the thick warm
stream
Of music from a jug of Boston cream.
The laboring boat was almost at the land
Where .Tones and Murphy watched and fatly
cheered.
The girl and I came panting hand in hand
Until that fatal landing-place we neared.
Then, suddenly, she thrust my arm away.
Paused, paled, and said, “Dear love, I think
we’ll stay.”
She spoke too late. For Jones his presence
rammed
Through our swift dream of joy and quiet
life
Like some torpedo—“ Murphy, I’ll be damned
I e our goat-hunter hasn’t found my wife!
She sailed the week before.... Come on, my
dear.
Now wlio’d have thought of us two meeting
here ?”
That pleasant family reunion caught
My young romance and strangled it to death.
The fury in my throat I fiercely fought
And choked red curses under panting breath.
And Jones still fatly thanked me o’er and
o’er
For finding Isabel upon the shore.
They rowed us out across the stupid sea,
The sea that, hungry, still refuses fat.
I wanted some wild wave to. bite for me
And chew him up from swelling socks .to hat.
But Isabel said nothing; and her hair
Flamed redly in the depth of my despair.
Ah, well, it did not matter. Jones and I
Row in one boat through all the latter days.
Though sometimes for a lone green isle I
sigh
Where through the fern, uncooked, a wild
goat strays,
To fate’s mysterious ways I needs must
bend —
She ran away with Murphy in the end.

PAT O’MAORI.
The Killing of Tommy Weegull.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAT) killed him quite to my liking, not
surreptitiously, but in a straightfor-
ward, manly way with a stick. There
was no external reason why I should have
been finicky about finishing this fellow Wee-
gull. He was a herder of turkeys, a poor,
belated creature with ovated legs and a nose
like that vivid fungus you may see growing
on trees in damn places —a scarlet nose,
shapeless and maimed, porous as a crumpet,
clinging to his face with the tenacity of an
obscene, creeping parasite threatening to
obscure its host.
I loathed Weegull’s nose. Besides, he had
a pretty wife. Why should one give a second
thought to a herder of turkeys? The world
had no real use for this man; the turkeys
were happier without him; he exercised a
depressing influence wherever he went. _ I
understand now that the value set on an in-
dividual human life is a mere delusion based
on egotism. One might as well be frantic
over a particular drop of water in the profu-
sion of the Pacific.
But I, too, entered into the error of
Genesis, and extended to man kingship over
the cabbage. That prompted the foolish
desire to give Weegull an even chance. So I
met him with a stick precisely like the
ancient shepherd’s crook he carried to im-
press his turkeys.
I told the man plainly. “Weegull, I am
going to kill you,” I said.
He seemed incredulous, so I rapped him
over the knuckles to stimulate him. It had
the desired effect. We fought among his
turkeys. The gobblers stampeded a few
paces like miniature camels, but with a pre-
tentious air of not being really hurried, and
thinking, as I could see, of their dignity all
the time, as turkeys will.
Every time we went slashing and scram-
bling in among the herd the foolish birds
stepped aside like that, with measured haste,
but as if anxious to impress us with their
restraint. They had, I perceived, great con-
tempt for my manners,-but uttered no sound
of remonstrance.
You will excuse me if I appear to you to
give too much attention to what you may
regard as immaterial things; but I am in a
position to know that the psychology of the
turkey is quite as interesting as that of
man, his meditations and actions quite as
important.
Meantime I was busy killing Weegull. I
discovered almost at the onset that the miser-
able creature knew more about fighting with
sticks .than I did. As an ex-sclioolmaster, my
early training was all against me. I had
been in the habit of asking creation to hold
out its hand, and creation had obeyed. This
fellow did not obey. I made slashing blows
at Weegull with my long prop. Weegull
prodded with bis. At the second prod I dis-
covered my error in not having formulated
rules; but it was not too late to learn—l
prodded, too. Then Weegull broke his weapon
off short, and got in at me. He beat me
about the head a good deal. I had not given
the fellow credit for such aplomb, nor had I
reckoned on his preposterous Will to live.
I came out of it all with a consciousness of
having effected my purpose. But prior to
the return of my perceptive faculties I had
removed, it seemed to me, some distance
from the scene of our encounter. Possibly
this action had arisen from a natural dis-
inclination to look upon my dead man. Wee-
gull is not the sort of man who dies ele-
gantly. Still, there remained some vestige
of regret that I had not stayed a moment to
note the . effect of dissolution upon Weegull’s
nose. Did it retain its vivid hue, or had it
faded in death? With an effort of imagina-
tion I pictured that nose like a pallid octopus
sprawling upon a rigid, upturned face.
So I had killed a man of sorts. True, he
was merely a herder of turkeys; but in the
eye of the law, and according to all the con-
ventional creeds, I was a murderer with the
same load of guilt as if I had killed a true
poet or an excellent engineer. I laughed
at the preposterous idea. There was not in
my heart a grain of compunction. Weegull
was dead, but it mattered no more than if I
had trodden on any other insect that might
have come in my way. I dusted my fingers,
and turned back through the trees.
Going along the slope of the range through
an occasional patch of thick undergrowth, an
interesting and most peculiar thing happened
to me. I came suddenly upon Weegull’s
turkeys. They were gathered in a herd in
the shadow of a great rock which in a night
of flood and fury had torn its tremendous
way down the granite ribs of the range, and
plunged into the soft soil, submerging itself
like a vast, prehistoric monster in a great
lake. As I looked at the rock I beheld the
tumult of the night and the tragedy of that
wonderful plunge five thousand years ago.
But that was incidental. I was most con-
cerned with the attitude of mind of Weegull’s
turkeys.
The birds were gathered in a sort of con-
clave, and I discovered they were actually
concerned about AYeegull. Weegull was, after
all, a force to them, a dominating force, an
all-powerful guide, an omnipotent adminis-
trator —a Providence!
Could anything be more ridiculous! I
laughed in their faces. I respect any
opinions that are worthy of respect, even
those of a kitchen cat. Opinions are definite,
self-sufficient things, and are no more to be
judged by the person entertaining them than
the quality of an egg is to be arrived at by
the character of the man momentarily pos-

Nurse Opray, residing at 31 King Street,
Prahran, Melbourne, adds her name to the
already long list of professional practitioners
who speak in praise of Zam-Buk. “I suffered
from a terribly bad hand,” says the nurse,
“which was caused through knocking it against
a door. Inflammation set in, iny hand com-
menced to swell up, and the pain was so great
1 could do. nothing with it. I was out nursing
at the time, but I was forced to give it up. All
the remedies I tried failed to do any good, and
at the end of three months my hand was get-
ting worse instead of better. A friend advised
me to use Zam-Buk. The benefit I derived
from the first few applications was very encour-
aging. After a while the wound was cleansed
and purified, and the healing process rapidly
set in. New healthy skin grew over the wound,
and my hand was as sound and strong as ever.

He was in a state of abject terror. His
mental processes were so disarranged it was
a matter of impossibility to see what he was
thinking.
I waded through the turkeys, and went to
Weegull. He was whimpering and shivering
like an injured monkey. I kicked at him, but
he disregarded me. I kicked again before
realising the truth.
Weegull was immaterial! Something of
the late Weegull was there, but my foot
encountered nothing. It was like kicking
into vapor, yet different. Vapor would be
dissipated in some measure by a kick; 'Wee-
gull was not affected in the least.
Well, # I was never so amused in all my
life. I stood back and surveyed him.
“Visible, but not tangible,” I said. “So,
my friend, you are a ghost? Am I to under-
stand that you are haunting me?” I laughed
again. I was always a man easily moved to
laughter, and the sight of Weegull’s essence,
so to speak, whimpering and shivering there,
while, no doubt, possessed of some spectral
idea of plaguing the soul of his slayer with
graveyard horrors, tickled me immensely.
“Is this to be a permanent job, Weegull?”
said I. “If it is, I may object to your con-
tinual presence on aesthetic grounds. But
there will be compensations, Weegull. You
will amuse me. On cold, wet. dark nights,
when the tempests rave at the old walls,
when the vines tap with dead lingers on my
window-panes, and the fires within flicker
low at the stroke of twelve, you will be a
welcome and entertaining guest, Weegull.
Promise you will never fail to drop in. But,
in the name of decency, do find some cover
for that lamb’s fry you call a nose.”
Weegull gave no more heed to my words
than lie had given to my kicking. He was
stowed in his nook like a hibernating bear,
but a dull, moaning complaint welled from
him ceaselessly, and he snivelled. I realised
that it was my fortune to be beset by an
unwholesome and dolorous ghost. But no
matter—the inessentials never troubled me.
I went away. I was curious to see if
Weegull would follow. It was in my mind
that he would be invisible in the sunlight.
But he remained snuggled, in his lair, with
his four and eighty turkeys gathered about
him in silent and worshipful sympathy.
After all, what an ass a turkey is!
The next two or three hours were spent
by me in a spiritless search for the body
of Tommy Weegull. I wanted it as evidence
of the stability of my senses ; but the failure
of my quest, provoked no concern. It was
not till nightfall that the thought of Dinah
came over me. I tried to be amazed at my
indifference. It was proper that I should
be amazed, for, after all, I had killed Wee-
gull for her sake. My dilettante artistic
objection to the man’s nose was only a semi-
comic subterfuge. I killed Weegull to rid
Dinah of what I felt must be an obnoxious
association, and to give her every oppor-
tunity of enjoying my more pleasing and
picturesque personality. Now, the deed be-
ing done and the way open, Dinah had faded
into insignificance. Her prettiness was
immaterial; the grace of her young, strong,
symmetrical limbs stirred no emotion; the
pansy purple of her eye, the rose red of her
cheek, the plum ripeness of her full lips—
things that once had wakened a great thirst
and an ineffable greediness in me—now con-
cerned me not at all. I had no need of
Dinah Weegull. I was no longer greedy. I
had no desires. I was looking-forward to
nothing. This curious emptiness might
pass; if not, Dinah would be very angry.
In killing Weegull I had deprived her of a
protector, a purveyor. She would have a
right to feel hurt if I let matters end there.
I recollected I had. not asked her permission.
It would seem that I had slaughtered her
husband from sheer perversity. How could
I reassure her? Here I was jerked up short
once more—l did not want to reassure her!
I knew for a certainty that what she might
be, think, say, or do troubled me no more
that the cogitations and perambulations of
the native hen at my elbow. It was all very
perplexing. One should not commit a mur-
der without looking into the matter
thoroughly. Too many murders are lightly
undertaken. Not that the killing of Tommy
Weegull was in itself of any consequence at
all; but perhaps it would have been as well
if I had not killed him. since there were
to be no compensations.
I went down towards Dinah’s little shingle
house in its green garden, where the clean
creek waters danced endless two-steps over
an age-old bed of granite.
Weegull was there before me. I saw him
distinctly in the dying twilight. He drove
his turkeys into the slab-fenced two acres at
the hack, and closed and fastened the gate
with his accustomed care. I saw his nose
wobble as he raised himself after taking his
coat from the ground.
Perturbation seized me. I ran towards
Tommy, with outstretched arms. I grappled
with him. but seized nothing. He passed by
me, heedless of my presence, and went to-
wards the house, his feet stumbling, the
agony of death upon his ghostly face. I fol-
lowed him, and lurked at the open door as
he passed in.
Dinah was in the living-room. I watched
through the crack of the door. I saw the
terror lea]) into her face as she beheld him.
She, too. was to be haunted, then! Her
dear! husband stood before her. his two
tremulous hands stretched from him, every
limb quivering, his distorted visage, with its
grotesque fungoid nose, tragically ludicrous.
Weegull’s young wife backed away as far
as the chimney, her fingers pressed between
her breasts, her eyes wide onen. amazed,
horrified. The ghost had triumphed! It
seemed as I stepped into the room that she
must sink under the weight of her terror.
“Permit me,” said I softly. “This is
Tommy Weegull, who is dead. He is. I
assure you. harmful in appearance only.”
Neither of them paid me the smallest
attention. Her eyes remained fixed upon
Weegull. Weegull held his two hands to-
wards her. displaying them.
“Blood!” she said.
“Yes,” he answered out of a dry throat.
“His blood! I killed him.”
“He lies!” I cried with forced interest.
“The fool lies.” I would have seized her
arm, but my hands clasped nothing. They
were like smoke upon her sound flesh.
I looked down, and beheld through my
ribs the lamp on the corner of the kitchen
table burning where my liver should have
been.
A pleasant feeling of relief came with
realisation. After all, I was the ghost!
EDWARD DYSON.
In the Public Interest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SALVANNI, the fruiterer, was a hot-
headed little Italian, perpetually on
the boil-over.
Luck or instinct led him to the only type
of wife he could have lived with, or who
could have tolerated life with him. She was
an amiable, easy-going girl, ignorant of
nerves.
On her placid nature Salvanni’s outbursts
raised never a ripple, and the marriage would
have been completely happy but for her
mother.
That good woman was sixteen stone in
bulk, obstinacy and prejudice. Her temper
was of the persistent, naggy order, and she
had a rooted bias against her son-in-law.
For two years she blocked the match. The
determined pair eloped. Eventually Mrs.
Stubbs unbent, but with the mental reserva-
tion : “Foreigners can’t live if you nark ’em.
Just let me keep on narkin’ Salvanni, and
he’ll shunt.”
Salvanni stood his mother-in-law’s shunt-
ing methods badly. Many a time she
approached victory. Two things prevented
his flight, lie was fond of his wife, and his
small shop, set out with the inherited taste
of his race, realised a years-long dream.
On the too-frequent occasions when Mrs.
Stubbs’s unwieldy form shuffled through his
little kingdom the rage in Salvanni’s heart
was unspeakable. Inevitably there followed
close on her arrival a clatter of plates.
Thereby Salvanni knew that ■ the contempt
for himself did not extend to his hard-earned
eatables. This stung him savagely, because
on the rare occasions when lie had been
compelled to enter his mother-in-law’s house
he had sat hungry. Mrs. Stubbs had taken
a vow: “Never, will that little foreign
animal get sup or bite in my house!”
Mrs. Stubbs's husband died. She announced
her intention of settling with the Salvannis.
Salvanni’s olive skin blanched.
“Mary, will you have such a thingV” ho
cried piteously to his much-upset wife.
Mary was fond of her husband. She was
afraid of her mother. Salvanni gave way
in things. Her mother never did. As she
loved comfort like a cat, she shrugged her
plump shoulders and replied: “You know
what ma is. When she makes up her mind
you can’t do nothing !”
Salvanni, to save himself from madness,
determined to take up some gigantic labor.
He started to persevere with his English.
The first thing lie spelled out was the re-
port in a daily paper of a coroner’s inquiry
into a case of ptomaine poisoning.
It was proved that the deceased woman
had eaten a hearty meal of sardines after
holding them exposed to the hot sun during
a half-hour’s yarn on her way from the
shop.
Sardines—his mother-in-law’s favorite
dish ! Salvanni was strangely quiet the rest
of the day. He was singularly restless
during the night.
The next morning the first relay of Mrs.
Stubbs’s luggage arrived ; also a peremptory
message that Salvanni must root out his bed
of salads, as it was directly under the win-
dow of the room she intended to occupy.
It was the best position in the yard for
Salvanni’s beloved salads. The calmness
with which he uprooted them was edifying.
Then he went out and bought a large tin of
sardines.
It was midsummer. Salvanni clambered
up to the roof, and placed the tin where the
hottest rays could bake it.
Before finally moving in, Mrs. Stubbs paid
a surprise visit to see if things were as she
had ordered. But Salvanni saw her coming.
It was a Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Salvanni
was having a chat at a neighbor’s house.
Salvanni offered to go and bring her home.
Mrs. Stubbs looked at the slender, polite-
spoken little man, and wondered that he had
held out so long—he was so small, and in
her eyes bulk was everything.
Salvanni glanced at the stout figure and
stupid face of his sworn enemy. For a
moment contempt took the place of his mur-
derous hate. He gazed across at the wire
safe in which he had placed the sardines
when the foe was sighted, and hesitated.
“You can give that thing away,” said
Mrs. Stubbs, pointing a contemptuous finger
at Salvanni’s adored concertina. “I can’t
stand music!”
Salvanni’s white teeth gleamed danger-
ously. He said nothing, but moved further
away from the safe. Mrs. Stubbs reckoned
he was properly subdued. The intoxication
of power possessed her.
“And you can unload your cart in front
on market mornings, so as not to wake me
up.” she ordered. Then, comfortably settled
in the one easy chair, she looked expectantly
towards the safe.
“You come to-morrow for good?” queried
Salvanni in silky tones.
“I do!” was the amiably triumphant
reply.
Salvanni’s glowing eyes lowered. “I go
now and bring Mary,” he said humbly.
At the doorway he paused. “Plenty is in
the safe. You not wait till we get back.”
Which invitation —altogether unnecessary
—Mrs. Stubbs took immediate and strenuous
advantage of.
Salvanni went for a long, meditative
stroll.
