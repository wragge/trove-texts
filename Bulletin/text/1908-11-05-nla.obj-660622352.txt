THE RED PAGE
Methods of Fiction
IF the art of fiction could be taught,
the amateur author might glean
much valuable information from the
many books upon story-writing which
pour out of the American press. But
the writer is born, not made ; and though
in the American universities courses of
lectures are regularly given to students
who aspire to be novelists, it is
merely the trade technicalities that they
acquire. Yet these can be learnt more
easily at a university than haphazardly
picked up from the author’s reading and
observation. There are certain rules
governing the structure and development
of the novel and the conte; and familiarity
with these rules is a valuable equipment
for the writer. But the American fiction-
tradesmen turned out by the universities
will not necessarily become great writers.
If, however, there happens to be a born
novelist among the students in these
classes, he will not regret the equipment
with which he has been furnished. It
might surely be worth our Australian
universities’ while to establish a “ fiction
course ” for our own arts-students. No
harm could be done, and editors would
live longer.
One of the best of the class of books
referred to is Materials and Methods of
Fiction, by Clayton Hamilton (Baker and
Taylor, New York). The author is not
foolish enough to stipulate that there is
any exact formula for literature. Pie
points out that the great writer must be
born with an “ experiencing nature.”
Very few people have an experiencing
nature. But great fiction may be written
only by men of an experiencing nature ; and
here is a basis for confession that, after all,
fiction-writers are born, not made. The
experiencing nature is difficult to define ;
but two of its most evident qualities are a
lively curiosity and a ready sympathy. A
combination of these two qualities gives a
man that intensity of interest in human life
which is a condition precedent to his ever
growing to understand it. The author who
aspires to write fiction should cultivate the
faculty of caring for all things that come to
pass; he should train himself religiously
never to be bored.
Upon the method of narrative, Hamil-
ton admirably restates some recognised
dicta :
The aim of description—which is to sug-
gest the look of things at a certain character-
istic moment—-is an aim necessarily static.
But life—which the novelist purposes to
represent —is not static, but dynamic. . . .
A novelist who devotes two successive pages
to the description of a landscape or a person
necessarily makes his story stand still while
he is doing it, and thereby belies an obvious
law of life. Therefore, as writers of fiction
have progressed in art, they have more and
more eliminated description for its own sake.
The narrative sense is, primarily, an ability
to trace an event back to its logical causes
and to look forward to its logical effects. . . .
Life, to the casual eye of the average man,
hides in the main the secrets ©f its series,
and betrays only an illogical succession of
events. . . The method of the artist in narra-
tive is to select events which bear an essen-
tial logical relation to each other, and then to
arrange them along the lines of a pattern of
causation.
Some Dont’s. In presenting charac-
ters don’t start off with a set de-
scription which the reader forgets
after turning the page. Make your
description little by little, rather than
in a lump, and present each time to
the reader only such traits or features
as he needs to be reminded of in order to
appreciate the scene before him. But,
better still, don’t describe at all. And
don’t psychologically analyse people’s
motives during action. During actual
occurrences people never pause to analyse
each other and seldom to analyse them-
selves. They act, and watch other people
act, without a microscopic insight into
motives. If a comment must be made
let it be given voice to by one of the
other characters in your story.
It is commonly supposed that what is
called “atmosphere” in a description is
dependent upon the setting forth of a multi-
plicity of details; but “atmosphere” is
dependent rather upon a strict selection of
details pervaded by a common quality, a
rigorous rejection of all others that are dis-
sonant in mood, and an arrangement of those
selected with a view to express their common
quality as the pervading spirit of the scene.
Hamilton attempts certain definitions:
Fiction is life distilled. . .
The aim of a short story is to produce a
single narrative effect with the greatest
economy of means that is consistent with
the utmost emphasis.
A book worth perusal by every tyro
in fiction.
The Reversolet.
It is strange that the Australian poets have
neglected it, for it is a product of early Aus-
tralia. The history of the Reversolet is in-
volved in obscurity, but the generally
accepted story of its origin is that which
ascribes it to John Henry Smith. J.H.S.
was a convict in the band despatched, in 1803,
to the Port Phillip settlement under Colonel
(afterwards Lieutenant-Governor) Collins.
Smith was of a poetical turn of mind, and
incurred the wrath of the authorities by com-
posing a series of crude lampoons on the
notorious Colonel. Collins, swearing he
would have Smith drowned for his “ damned
insolence,” made the convict wade into the
sea (at point of the bayonet) “up to his
middle”; but, finally relenting, ordered him
ashore again. Smith was so elated at thus
avoiding punishment that he invented the
verse-form “Reversolet”to commemorate his
escapade. The first effort he dedicated to
the Lieutenant-Governor, for which crime he
was promptly hanged.
Since then the Reversolet has not been a
popular verse-form. You will not find it in
Gordon or Kendall or Brunton Stephens.
The Bulletin immortals—Victor Daley,
Roderic Quinn-, Paterson, Ogilvie and Com-
pany—seem to be unaware of its existence.
Even Wilson Dobbs ignores it, and it was
never upon the lipsof JamesPurtell. It seems
meet in these circumstances to give a few
examples of its capacity for expression.
The Reversolet, briefly, is a verse-series
which, like convict John Henry in the story,
goes in to the middle and then comes back
again. There is a short and a long form.
The short form consists of four lines, which
are succeeded by the “ middle ” line (often in
longer metre, but not necessarily), and then
repeated in reverse order. In the long form
there are eight lines before reversion, and
the “middle” is omitted. The form is by
no means an easy one ; the point of a good
Reversolet is an avoidance of mere repetition
of the first idea.
The short:
MINNIE.
Minnie’s just a trifle cool:
When she goes along the bails
To milk ’er six, she asks that fool
Long Jim to ’elp—with all the males
A-glarin’ jealous ’cross the pails !
Long Jim to ’elp ? With all the males
To milk ’er six, she asks that fool!
When she goes along the bails
Minnie’s just a trifle cool!
The long:
HONGKONG HO.
When I was in China
’Mid the yellow Chows,
I had joys yet finer
Than the law allows ;
Smoking up more opium,
And the chopstick using
’Mid the dinner’s drowsy hum.
Wasn’t it amusing,
’Mid the dinner’s drowsy hum,
And the chopstick using,
Smoking up more opium
Than the law allows ?
I had joys yet finer
’Mid the yellow Chows
When I was in China !
vl/
The lure of verse, says Schopenhauer some-
where, is the reiteration of the once-heard.
By this standard the Reversolet can claim a
summit of poesy. The short form in especial
lends itself to verse of the melancholic order :
BEFORE SUICIDE.
The burning Sorrow,
The weary Pain
In life to-morrow !
What do we gain—
Drowned in the bitter tears’ sad rain ?
What do we gain
In life to-morrow ?
The weary Pain !
The burning Sorrow !
While the long form can be magnificent in
commination, as witness the Reversolet
written by an irritable old Gentleman to his
Poor Relation :
DAMN.
I curse you—go to Hell!
By Sheol’s blasted marge,
By candle, book, and bell,
I’ll give you straight in charge 1
In spite of what you mutter,
Damned carrion ! I’ll outlast you ;
Upon my life you’re but a
Parasitic vampire, blast you,
Upon my life ! You’re but a
Damned carrion ! I’ll outlast you
In spite of what yon mutter !
I’ll give you straight in charge !
By candle, book, and bell,
By Hheol’s blasted niarge,
I curse you ! Go to Hell !!
Or consider the short Reversolet in a ten-
der mood :
I love. But you 1
I know but this—
Since your first kiss
My soul you drew
To light of bliss ; the darkness through
My soul you drew !
Since your firs O-kiss
I know but this—
■ I love but you.

Of striking interest to all art-workers is
the special summer number of The Studio,
dealing with Color Photography (65.). There
are a few workers in Australia in the new
autochrome photography, which produces
pictures in the actual colors of nature.
These photographs, so far, can be produced
only as glass positives, and must be viewed
by light through the plates. Seen thus, the
vividness and beauty of color are remark
able ; and reproductions, even so accurately
done as by The Studio, give but an imperfect
representation of the original brilliancy.
But to the artist the work in the familiar
photographic monochrome which makes up
the bulk of the book is infinitely more satis-
fying. The editor of Color Photography aptly
points out the present artistic limitations of
the new process. The color photographs
look piquant, staccato, metallic— ‘‘ a rather
tart echo of Nature.” It is almost as if one
were looking at a landscape or a person
through the wrong end of a telescope. What
has been so far achieved is merely “an
exquisite automatic delicacy resulting in an
image of unyielding exactness ” —which indi-
cates the present limits of the process. In
this method of rendering Nature there is no
scope for the aesthetic aspect, mo freedom
for the photographer to eliminate or balance.
The thing is exact—too exact, and Nature
to become art requires modification. The
Lumiere plate reproduces the colors inde-
pendently, whereas the eye does not see colors
independently. But with all this, there is still
left to the color-photographer the
rare possibility of finding in
Nature beauty of mass and line
married to a perfect melody of
color. The painter is content
to find his lineal melody in one
place, his chromatic melody in
another, and combine them in
one picture ; but the color-photo-
grapher must find the two
together. In still-life and por-
traiture this can be done ; but
in landscape the quest is" almost
hopeless, and most of the land-
scapes in this book aim solely at
color effects, leaving the compo-
sition to take care of itself. But
for art the monochrome pictures
in this book show a perfection
of technique so far denied to the
workers in the new medium.
In the first part of Yol. IV.
of his comprehensive work, The
Forest Flora of N.S.W., J. 11.
Maiden publishes some curious
photographs of trees carved by
aboriginals, probably to mark the
graves of their chiefs. The pre-
sent part, well illustrated by
photograplxs and drawings, deals
fully with Black butt, Onion
Wood, Cootamundra Wattle, and
Grey Sassafras. The Director
of what an American pressman
on the Fleet termed the most beautiful
botanical gardens in the world is to be
congratulated upon the successive portions
of a work that is of national importance.
Some mere prose, masquerading in verse
form, is published by J. B. Mather (Bony-
thon, King William-street, Adelaide) under
the title, Out of the Depths. He starts off
with prose like this :
The life of Christ is greatest of all idylls,
Sorrow and beauty linking hand in hand.
And he continues like this:
For pity linked to terror there is nothing
In all Greek tragedy that can compare
With Christ’s brief life ; and those who’d learn of
sorrow
Or deep compassion, have their lesson there.
It is all quite harmless.
“O. C. Cabot,” re an almost forgotten
controversy which is now killed : As
to “ Hufiin-Guftin,” you are right: “Lin-
coln ” does afford me (or any other critic)
material for the charge of plagiarism
against Markham. Take his image of the
fallen tree—it is collared from Tennyson’s
Gareth and Lynnette :
The last tall son of Lot and Bellieent,
And tallest, Gareth, in a showerful spring
Stared at the spate. A slender-shafted pine
Lost footing, fell, and so was whirled away.
“ How he went down,” said Gareth, “as a false
knight,” . . . etc.
And all through “ Lincoln ” peep out little
bits of Browning and Shelley and Blair’s
“The Grave,” and the catalogue of wheats
and soils, etc., seems to have been inspired
by the Sydney D.T.’s agricultural column.
R. L. Stevenson’s A Child’s Garden of
Verses is charmingly illustrated in color and
line by Millicent Sowerby, and equally
charmingly produced by Chatto and Windus
(London, ss. net —which means more out
this way). R.L.S. being always a child,
knows the heart of a child, and his verses
will live as long as there are nurseries.
Perhaps the best of this collection is the
stanza,
When I am grown to man’s estate,
I shall be very proud and great,
And tell the other girls and boys
Not to meddle with my toys.
In this form this volume is the ideal present
for the kiddie.
AUSTRALIAN NURSERY RHYMES.
Little Boy Blue, your whip come and crack,
And go to the paddock to bring the cows back.
Where is the maid with her milking pail ?
Oh, we use machines, and they milk without fail.
Goosey Goosey Gander,
Whither do you tvander ?
Your place is in the poultry yard
And not on the verandah.
Little Miss Mufet
Arose from her tuffet
To box with the old kangaroo.
There came a big ivbmbat
To join in the combat.
And little Miss Mufet withdrew.
I had a little pony.
His name was Dapple Gray.
I sent him down to Melbourne.
To ivin the Gup one day.
He couldn't beat Poseidon,
For Poseidon’s hard to beat.
And now he pulls a hansom, cab
Along a Sydney street.
Ding dong bell,
Piissy’s in the well,
’Twas all the water we had got,
And now we'll have to waste the lot.
Hush-a-bye baby, on the tree top.
Grasshoppers ate up the whole of our crop.
When the drought breaks the rabbits will come.
Hush-a-bye baby , the outlook is glum.

An Overtaxed System
Extreme Nervousness Completely Cured.
An epoch-making achievement is here dealt
with by Mr. Michael Somers, of 47 Camden
Street, Newtown, who speaks of final success
being inevitable in similar cases if like measures
are adopted. His narrative takes the following
form: —
“ I was sitting down writing a letter one day
in Brisbane, feeling as well as a man could wish to
be, when I suddenly was seized with a dreadful
sensation, and collapsed. Previous to this I had
been leading a very strenuous life, working at top
pressure, and, presumably, I had overdone it.
The strongest systems will break down when
taxed too much, as I have learned to my cost.”
“What happened,” asked our representative,
“ when you were thus attacked ? ”
“ The case looked to be such a serious one that
I was taken to a hospital in an ambulance, and
there I received the very best attention they
could devote to me. Medicine was ordered, and
everything done they could think of. In all my
travels, and I have journeyed about a good deal,
I have never met a similar case to my own. It
certainly puzzled the doctors at the institution,
for they could not make head nor tail of the cause
of my affliction.”
“Can you describe to me the feelings you had,
Mr. Somers?”
*‘ Constantly recurring feelings of faintness were
as troublesome as anything—such horrible sensa-
tions as would make a man think he was going off
at any moment, and, besides, I was afflicted with
the most extreme nervousness it had ever been
my misfortune to come into contact with. When
everybody else was in bed, comfortably asleep,
was the time that my nerve troubles assumed the
greatest dimensions, and I would have given all I
possessed in the world to have been able to doze
off and get rid, for a while, of the harassing
thoughts that disturbed my mind. I could think
of nothing pleasant; every idea that came was
created in an atmosphere of adversity. I felt that
I was hemmed in by hardships and trials of all
kinds, and I think I was, too. Perhaps I was on
the point of falling asleep when, with a little
convulsive jump, I’d start up again. It was a
feeling as if my heart had momentarily stopped,
and there I’d be dreading the same thing
happening again, for fear of what might follow.
That’s the wretched way most nights went by, so
imagine my despondent, worn-out condition
during the day. Suffocating feelings badly affected
my chest, ami with difficulty I succeeded in
getting my breath. Meanwhile, the sudden
jumping sensations in the heart’s region con-
tinued, accompanied withaterriblefaintness, which
made me often think that my time had come, and
that I surely was going to die. Sometimes a
feeling came as if I were actually dead in parts —
a horrible kind of numbness, it was—in the
stomach, chin, and back of the neck, and again
and again I was seized with the terrible conviction
that I was going to drop dead. I was really
afraid to fall asleep in case one of these seizures
would come on, and I would never wake up again.
Oh ! how awful it was. The extreme weakness
and constant twitching of my nerves could not be
checked by anything the doctors prescribed for
me, and I had long since despaired of ever being
about in the world again, when I started, through
reading a testimonial in the paper, taking the
medicine called Clements Tonic.”
“ And can you conscientiously state that
Clements Tonic made you as sound as you are
now ? ” queried the writer, looking at Mr. Somers
in amazement.
“ I can, indeed ; though it may seem incredible ;
but my wife and son here can vouch for what I
say being the gospel truth. The symptoms I have
described did not leave me for a long, long time,
and then only through the wonderful agency of
Clements Tonic. That is the truth, as God is my
judge. It seems like a dream to look back upon
—the hospital, the doctors, the numerous medicines
that did not apply to me at all beneficially, the
fainting bouts, tjje feelings of paralysis in parts of
my body, the unhappy frame of mind I was in,
the sleepless nights, the twitching of my every
nerve, the awful heart affections, and the intense
feebleness withal—yes, it seems like a hideous
dream that has passed and gone, for which I have
nothing in the world to thank but Clements
Tonic; so please publish the facts as you like.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, MICHAEL SOMERS, of 47 Camden Street, Newtown,
in the State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of
Australia, do solemnly and sincerely declare that I have
carefully read the annexed document, and that it contains
and is a true and faithful account of my illness and cure
by Clements Tonic, and also contains my full permission
to publish in any way my statements—which I give
voluntarily, without receiving any payment; and I make
this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the sarne
to be true, and by virtue- of the provisions of the Oaths
Act, 1900.
Subscribed and declared at Newtown this twenty-
seventh day of February, one thousand-nine hundred and
eight, before me, „ . „

** Rowland, aged 6, was very
ill with wasting disease, the
bones being nearly through the
skin, and we had very little
hope of his recovery. However,
thanks to SCOTT'S Emulsion,
he is to-day a fine healthy boy.
Norman was born with
spinal
trouble
and had never been able to sit up
unsupported. At 2 years I started
SCOTT'S and after the first
bottle he could sit up alone and
move a little. Now he is 7£ years
old, and able to walk.
My fifth baby, Charles, was
very weak and ill with whooping
cough, bronchitis and teething,
but the first few doses of
SCOTT'S relieved him greatly
and he has now lost the cough,
and is gaining strength and
putting on flesh rapidly."

Above Is the Proof In the Facts.
Here is Proof in the Reason Why:
This powerof SCOTT’S Emulsion
to cure speedily and radically
makes it the most economical of all
m
emulsions, for the
sooner the cure
comes the sooner
the expense stops.
It is the fine, vigo-
rous quality of all
the materials used
in SCOTT’S, and
the perfect digesti-
bility which the
SCOTT process
achieves, that give
to SCOTT’S a rapidity and cer-
tainty of action that none of its
competitors can equal. Therefore,
when purchasing, don’t ask for
“Emulsion;” ask for and get
SCOTT
Emulsion
—the difference between them means
a cure for you! See that “ the Fishman

Gipsy Spring.
The Spring is in the garden, the Spring is on the
hill,
She’s catching at my heart-strings, she’s pulling at
my will;
Oh, the green of growing fern-trees, the rush of
streams in flood,
The gipsy Spring is singing, and her song is in my
blood !
She would woo me to the mountains where the
long, sweet grasses wave,
To the glory and the brightness that the elder
springtides gave
To the vast unpeopled spaces where the skies are
broad and fair,
For the Spring’s a gipsy rover with the sunlight
in her hair.
I am sick of ink and paper, and the noise of talk-
ing men,
I am hungry for the star-gleam through the
purple of the glen ;
I would break the chains that bind me, I would
wander, I would sing
Close behind the trailing brightness of my bonny
Gipsy Spring.
Is it fever? Is it madness? I would break from
law and rule,
Like the fantails and the robins, to be glad and
play the fool;
Oh, the peaches break in blossom and the apples
are in bud,
And the Gipsy Spring is singing, and her song is
in my blood.

We travel all the tracks of earth,
For our diversion Life displays
Her masque of gravity and mirth,
New scenes unveiling with the days.
Our lodging is where fortune finds
Us wandering at fall of night.
Kin are we to the homeless winds,
Those vagrants of the infinite.
The faint grey distance holds our hearts;
Dim ranges lure us ; spar-lined quays
Weave dreams of strange barbaric parts
And gorgeous cities overseas.
Poet and pedlar, clown and sage,
Gentle and simple, skilled and rude,
We tramp our way from youth to age,
A careless, ragged multitude.
Our boots may gape, wise fools may sneer,
The sun may scorch, the rain may beat.
We care not, so our eyes be clear
The moving spectacle to greet.
The cakes and ale for which men strain,
And deem the summit of desire,
Shelter from heat and cold and rain,
The armchair by the winter’s fire,
Soft beds and viands delicate,
The comforts of the housewife’s art,—
Those worldly goods men venerate,
In such as these we crave no part.
Fo’c’sle and beach and dock-side slum,
The swagman’s camp, the hard park seat,
By turns they claim us till we come
To where all earthly highways meet.

Thou Baldhead!
When I am very old and stout and grey,
Fat-limbed and lazy-geared,
With ash of old cigars in disarray
All down my beard,
I trust that in those days I may not see
Upon my fine, old brow
Like marks to those that score the brow of the
Old beasts I scoff at now !
There is the old and purple-visaged cove
Who, when by chance we meet,
Shouts at me just as if I were a drove
Of cattle in the street.
He tells me wondrous Tory lies galore
(He is a Blot),
And when I answer breaks into a roar :
“What? Nonsense! Nonsense! Rot I”
There is the long-tailed one of whom we wot,
Jammed in his Narrow Way
That some fine day will lead him on—to what ?
Perhaps to bishop’s pay !
By what great plans, with prayer and fasting made,
Will he uplift the earth ?
The sweated Book, and for the poor—Freetrade !
A policy for mirth !
And that fat soul who draws my attic rent
Looks goggle-eyed and grim,
As though his flushed and angry days were spent
In argument with him
Who will believe that due possession is
Nine blooming points at least,
And will not pay his rent. A man like this
Must be a biassed beast.
Old, old and blind and fat and ignorant,
The blessed lot o’ these—
Fat-hearted and fat-headed, full of pant
And puff and grunt and wheeze !
When I am old, like these stale, stagnant men
' Whom I despise so now,
I trust I’ll bear a different trade-mark then
Upon my ancient brow !

THE CONGESTED POPULATION PARTY
AND THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL.
rpjjjg evening', 1 xir accidents, mishaps and odd
chances, the Senate will take a ballot on the
question of the Australian capital. If it comes to
the same decision as did the House of Representa-
tives, there will then be only seven matters
{and any odd matters that have not been foreseen)
to be attended to before the final settlement is
arrived at. First (1) there will be the selection
of the actual site inside the so-called Yass-
Canberra area. Then (2) it will be necessary to
pass a Bill through the House of Representatives
to authorise the building of a capital on that site,
and when it comes down to the matter of a definite
site instead of a large, vague district, the
Yass-Canberra crowd will probably dissolve into
its original elements as the Nass people, the Can-
berra people and the Lake George people, and
there will be much confusion, and the other parties
will presumably propose their sites as amendments
on the Bill, and any old thing may happen. The
next trouble (3) will be to get the Bill through the
Senate, where, also, the fight will probably happen
all over again, and any ancient circumstance may
transpire. After that, there will be (4) the bitter
row with State Premier Wade about his proposal
to make the whole Federal territory smaller than
Brisbane and its suburbs; (5) the row with the
same person as to whether the capital of Aus-
tralia is to have its own water supply or to depend
on such water as Wade’s Government chooses to
allow it; (6) the question about a Federal port at
Jervis Bay and railway communication therewith;
and (7) the almost inevitable shindy in the High
Court as to the legality of a Federal territory, por-
tion of which will be 13 miles inside the limit speci-
fied by the Constitution. Apart from these seven
distinct and several rows —the last of which may
blow the whole selection kite high—and any odd
rows not foreseen, the choice of the Yassberra
site at a Senatorial ballot will end the
trouble. If the Senate, on the other hand,
sticks to the site already selected, there will
also be seven separate and individual difficulties
to be faced before a conclusion is reached. The
only difference will be that there will be a row or
deadlock with the House of Representatives
instead of a row in the High Court. In all other
respects, the troubles ahead are just about the
same which ever course the Senate takes.
***■*■
Everything is now narrowed down to a conflict
between the people who want to introduce popu-
lation to the fertile waste places of Australia, and
those who want to congest population in the
already congested regions of this generally empty
continent. There are quite a number of people
who hold forth largely in theory about “de-
centralisation,” and “the necessity for settling
people on the land,” and “ the need for filling
up our empty spaces”; but, on the evidence,
quite a lot of them are liars and quite a large
proportion of them are hypocrites. It was
recognised from the beginning that the establish-
ment of an Australian capital must, if that capital
was placed in anything like a favorable situation,
bring together quite a mass of population.
Promptly there came the claim that the capital,
and the population which it would attract, should
be in N.S.W., and that no other State should
even be considered in the matter, because N.S.W.
has already a larger population than any other
State. The howl of the Congested Population
Party therein asserted itself. Then the fact that
Sydney is already the biggest city in Australia
was regarded as sufficient reason why the capital,
being in N.S.W., should be planted as close to
Sydney as the limits laid down in the Constitu-
tion would allow. The Congested Population
Party was strong on the theory that Congestion
must be encouraged to the last gasp. The fact that
the amazingly-congested County of Cumberland
had, at the date of last census, a population of
362 persons to the square mile, which is the most
remarkable case of Congestion in Australia—the
average of N.S.W. was then less than 4| persons
to the square mile, and that of the whole Com-
monwealth less than 1J persons to the square
mile—waSj and still is, held to be a reason why
the Australian capital should be planted as close
up to the borders of Cumberland County as pos-
sible in order that its trade may bring more
population to a district which is already about
200 times more crowded than the Australian
average. And the fact that Sydney has already
more trade than any other Australian port has
been advanced as a sufficient reason why the
Australian capital should be placed where its
trade will all go to Sydney, in order to
crowd that crowded port still further. So
long as every place votes for itself the most
congested place must win. In the selection of
a capital for the Universe it is possible that Bal-
main would beat Heaven. Balmain has about
32,000 people, and the population of Heaven is
quite uncertain. The place which, at present, has
practically no population gets no votes except those
of the people who consider the interests of Aus-
tralia first, and people of that kind are apparently
very few.
In the controversy between Yass-Canberra and
Dalgety, the chief points that were ostensibly
raised concerned climate, accessibility as regards
existing cities, fertility, adjacency to a good har-
bor, and water supply. It was hardly possible to
blatantly advance the theory that population
ought to be congested, and that because a place
was already more densely populated than any
other in Australasia, therefore the Australian
capital should be placed where it would drive more
population to that already congested spot. The
party which has talked so much about “decen-
tralisation” and “settling the people on the
land ” had to preserve a certain pretence of
decency and consistency. So it discoursed largely
on climate, accessibility, fertility, water supply,
and nearness to a good harbor. As regards
climate, it must be remembered that there are
no official records for Dalgety; the returns that
are supplied for that place are based on private
observations, made with any kind of an erratic
old thermometer and by any kind of an unskilled
observer. And the same statement applies to
Canberra. But there are official records for Bom-
bala, which is near Dalgety, only 350 ft. higher,
and consequently colder; and there are official
records for Yass, in the famous Yass-Canberra
site which won the ballot in the House of Repre-
sentatives, but Yass is 1000 ft. lower than Can-
berra, and consequently is, or should be, warmer.
And, according to the N.S.W. Statistical
Register for 1906, the latest volume pub-
lished (page 616), the highest temperate at
Yass in 1906 was 103£, and at Bombala
98|, which implied that in summer Bombala
was five degrees the more pleasant of the two.
And the lowest winter temperatures that year
were 22 at Yass and 22 and one-fifth at
\Bombala, which inferred that in winter Bombala
was one-fifth of' a degree the milder of the two.
Yass is the only official observing station (bar-
ring, possibly, Queanbeyan) in the Yass-Canberra
district, but it has the advantage of being 1000 ft.
lower (and consequently milder) than Canberra ;
while Bombala is the only official observing station
in the Bombala-Dalgety district, but it has the
disadvantage of being 350 ft. higher (and conse-
quently colder) than Dalgety. Therefore when
the N.S.W. State records show Yass to be hotter
in summer and colder in winter than Bombala,
an impression is liable to arise, either that it was
a very exceptional year, or that the Congested
Population Party has done an immensity of hard
lying about the proposed capital by the Snowy
River. Queanbeyan, by the way, which is right
alongside Canberra, got down, in 1906, to 191,,
which was three degrees colder than Bombala.
In the matter of accessibility. aYassberra capital
would lie somewhere on a small branch line off the
present Sydney-Melbourne railroad, unless that
railroad were shifted. A capital at Dalgety would
be on the inevitable new main line from Sydney to
Melbourne, unless that lirfe were diverted out of
sheer parochial malice and cussed ness af orethough t.
The Victorian Government has already promised
to finish the line from Bairnsdale to the N.S.W.
border, and the N.S.W. Government has already
promised to extend its line southward from Cooma
to Bombala, on the ground that the extraordinary
fertility of Monaro (which it always declares to be
a howling desert when it is talking of the place as
a possible Federal capital site) calls for the exten-
sion. If Dalgety were fixed upon as a capital site
the work of connecting these two lines would rest
with the Australian Parliament, and then the
Federal capital at Dalgety would be located on
a main line between Australia’s two great cities
instead of on a mere branch or by-way, as would
be the case if it were planted somewhere between
Yass and Canberra.
* * * *
In the matter of fertility there doesn’tseem to be
much to choose. An estimate of fertility is hard to
arrive at, but the wheat yield suggests astandard of
comparison. A Yassberra capital would presum-
ably lie east from Yass, towards Jervis Bay, in the
county of Murray, which county, according to the
latest statistics (N.S.W. Statistical Register
for 1906, page 492), yielded 147 bushels to every 10
acres. And a Dalgety capital would presumably
lie eastward of Dalgety, towards Twofold Bay, in
the county of Wellesley, which, according to the
same authority (same date and same page) yielded
161 bushels to every 10 acres. The advantage is
with Dalgety. As regards water supply, at
Dalgety the Federal capital would have, in
its own territory and under its own control,
the Snowy, Eucumbene, Crackenback and
Mowamba rivers, constituting about the grandest
supply of drinking water and cheap water power
for manufacturing purposes in Australasia, and
being all rivers that are not at present in use.
At Yassberra it would apparently depend on an
allowance from the State reservoir at Barren
Jack or the streams that feed Barren Jack, which,
it is understood, the State also wants for irrigation
purposes. In the matter of a harbor, Dalgety would
have Twofold Bay and Yassberra would have
Jervis Bay, unless the High Court ruled out Jervis
Bay on the ground that it is 13 miles the wrong
side of the 100-miles limit from Sydney. Dalgety
is nearer to Twofold Bay than Yassberra is to
Jervis Bay, therefore the cession of a smaller
territory would connect Dalgety with the sea
than Yassberra. As to the suitability of
the two harbors, it is difficult to .say. But
when Mr. Alexander Oliver, the N.S.W. Lands
office official who was appointed by the N.S.W.
Government to investigate the matter, published
his “Short Review” of the different reports on
proposed capital sites (19/8/1903) he attached
charts of the two harbors with soundings and
other information. The soundings showed two
splendid harbors, the least depth given in Jervis
Bay, the port of Yass-Canberra, being 12ft., and
the least depth given in Twofold Bay, the
port of Dalgety, being 30ft. On this evidence
Twofold Bay is the better harbor of the pair.
And presumably that amazing pioneer and ad-
venturer. old Ben Boyd, manager of the original
Royal Bank, thought so when he built Boyd
Town on Twofold Bay—Boyd Town, the City
that Came to Grief because the Sydney Govern-
ment refused to allow the lighthouse to be illumi-
nated, wherefore the new port, which might have
been the second greatest in N.S.W. if not the
second in Australia, died a premature death, and
its creator drifted away to Polynesia, to be eaten
by the casual cannibal.
So we get back to the old point that the struggle
between Yassberra and Dalgety is the struggle
between the party which wants to till up the
empty places of Australia and the party which
wants to further crowd those which are already
pretty full. Dalgety has the advantage in fer-
tility, in nearness to a port, in the suitability of
that port, in water supply, in clima-te (so
far as the records of 1906 go), and in the
fact that it can, in a very short space of
time (in fact, before the capital is built), be
located on a main Sydney-Melbourne and Bris-
bane-Adelaide line, while the Yassberra site, un-
less the existing main line is shifted so as to cut
out Yass altogether, must needs be on a mere
branch or by-way or side issue. But Dalgety
loses its case hopelessly on the fact that it
isn’t crowded close up against the Congested
Population. It isn’t almost alongside the
biggest city in Australia, and the most crowded
port in Australia, and the only county in Aus-
tralia which has a population of 362 persons to
the square mile. It has nobody in particular to
speak for it, in which respect it stands in the
same position which the original Garden of Eden
would have occupied if pitted against Footscray
in Melbourne, or Botany or Lower George-street
in Sydney, or Whitechapel in London—or even
against perdition. The ideal spot for the Aus-
tralian capital would have been on one of the
great rivers in the Northern Territory, so that its
establishment would have brought population
where the need for population is greatest. The
three States which should have been absolutely
ruled out, as possible capital sites, were Vic-
toria, Tasmania and N.S.W. —the three with
the most population in proportion to their
area, and the least need of any outside aid
to attract people to their territories. That dream
vanished early; on the ground that N.S.W.
already had more population than any other
State, the N.S.W. Government demanded that
the capital, and the extra population which
it would bring, should be in N.S.W. Then arose
a struggle between the party which wanted to
place the capital in that part of the-fertile district
of N.S.W. where population is most needed and the
one which wanted to locate it in that phrt where
population is least needed. The Congested Popula-
tion crowd won a temporary success at the ballot in
the House of Representatives, but whether the
victory will be permanent or not remains to be
seen. There is still a long way to go.
PROTECTION FOR LITHGOW IRON, AND
N.S.W.'s SIX FREETRADE SENATORS,
AND OTHER MATTERS.
A FEW days ago there was a sudden shutting up at
the ironworks at Lithgow (N.S.W.), and 300
men were thrown out of employment. And
there seems to be a chance of a greater
shutting up ahead. By way of explanation
of this grievous circumstance, Mr. C. H. Hos-
kins, one of the proprietors, stated that it
was impossible to go on under Freetrade
conditions—in other words, that it was hopeless
to attempt, in a young industry that hadn’t
grown to a size at which it could work in the
most economical fashion, to compete against im-
ported goods and yet pay the high Australian rate
of wages. So one of the most essential and valu-
able of the State’s industries is up against three
alternatives—Protection, or sweated labor, or
plain extinction. Therefore it comes to pass
that Bowden, the rigidly Freetrade member
for the district in which Lithgow is situated,
wants Protection for the Lithgow iron industry.
And Joseph Cook, the rigid Freetrader who
used to represent the district, wants Protection
for the Lithgow iron industry. And George
Fuller, the rigid Freetrader who represents a
constituency not far off, wants Protection for the
Lithgow iron industry. And the Freetrade
Sydney Herald and Telegraph not only want
the alleged Curse of Protection for the Sydney
iron industry, but say darkly that if it were not
that Lithgow is in N.S.W., and consequently an
object of the hatred of the other States, it would
have got the Blessing of the Curse of Protection
long ago. And the iron industry isn’t the only
matter on which allegedly Freetrade N.S.W.
papers and politicians want Protection —not by
any means. N.S.W. wants Protection, as it has
always done, for its breweries, its wine industry,
its tobacco, its sugar, and for any number of other
things.
* * * *
The question arises just here : Why, on logical
grounds, should the N.S.W. iron industry be
protected ? Even supposing it were true that the
iron industry would have been protected if it had
been located in Queensland, or Tasmania, or 5.A..,
or Victoria, and that the fact of it being in
N.S.W. caused it to be left out —why should that
fact not cause it to be left out ? On the face
of things, whenever there is an industry
which can be distinguished as a purely
N.S.W. industry, one would think that it
ought to have the blessings of Freetrade and Free
Competition, even if it died in consequence. The
one test of a State’s fiscal sentiments should be
the men it elects to the Senate, because the
Senators are elected by the whole community
voting as one constituency. N.S.W., partly by
force of habit and partly because it allows itself
to be fooled by these awful rags, the Sydney
Herald and Telegraph and News, elects six
blatantly Freetrade or alleged Freetrade Senators
—Gould and Soapy Gray and Millen and
warrior Neild and Pulsford and Walker.
It is the only State which sends a
solid band of " alleged Freetraders to the
Senate as a sign that it wants absolute Free-
trade for the Lithgow iron industry and for
all other N.S.W. industries. Likewise it elects
a more solid band of alleged Freetraders to the
House of Representatives than does any other
State, and that is also a sign that it wants absolute
Freetrade—not adulterated by either bonuses or
Customs duties or differential railway rates —for
the Lithgow iron industry and all other N.S.W.
industries. And the N.S.W. Labor party, which
represents the ironworkers of Lithgow, has always
refused to associate itself with Protection. It
secretly wants Protection for the Lithgow
iron-workers, but quite a number of its mem-
bers keep up the farce of pretending to
believe that Protection is a Curse none the
less. The very electorate in which Lithgow
is situated has always returned an avowed Free-
trader to the House of Representatives, though it
badly wants Protection, and its allegedly Free-
trade member badly wants it to have Protection.
, * * * ■
In this matter the attitude of the S. M. Herald
is typical of the whole Freetrade position. The
Herald says that Freetrade —complete, beauti-
ful, unadulterated Freetrade —is a Blessing and
that Protection is a Curse. When an isolated
N.S.W. industry like the Lithgow iron business
happens to get the Blessing of Freetrade (as
almost every other N.S.W. industry is enjoying
tfie Curse of Protection, it seems to have been by
mere accident that the Blessing of Freetrade fell
on Lithgow) the Herald holds that the evil deed
came to pass solely through the mean, wicked
jealousy of the other States, and that because of
their ill-feeling N.S.W. got the disastrous Blessing
which it didn’t want instead of the beautiful Curse
that it was entitled to. It rages, too, because
some “tinpot Victorian manufacturer” has got
the Curse of Protection, when one might rather
expect it to be glad that the evil thing fell on
Melbourne instead of Sydney, The attitude of
almost all the alleged Freetrade papers and
alleged Freetrade politicians of N.S.W. is much
the same. They demand special consideration
for N-3-W. in the matter of the Federal capital and
in other respects because of the special “sacrifices”
the State made in giving up, for the sake of
union, the Freetrade it never possessed. At the
same time they say that, in the matter of the
Lithgow iron industry, the other States have
entered into a base conspiracy to give N.S.W. a
whole lot of Freetrade that it doesn't want. Yet
if it were true, as alleged, that the iron industry
received the alleged Blessing of Freetrade because
it is especially a N.S.W. industry, it is hard to
see where any logical ground of complaint could
come in. If the only State which returns none
but Freetrade Senators isn’t asking for Freetrade,
what is it asking for ?
* * * *
It is interesting to consider what inducement
the members from the other States have to inter-
fere in this matter. All the Freetrade daily
papers in Sydney want Protection for the Lith-
gow iron works, but if they get it they will still
denounce Protection as a Curse, and treat Deakin,
Lyne, Chapman and co. in a large, patronising
way as children or idiots because they believe in
Protection, and because they don’t appreciate the
alleged Blessings of Freetrade. Also they will
still demand Freetrade for all the industries
which don’t belong to N.S.W., and talk of the
“ pampered Victorian manufacturer,” and things
of that sort. The whole six alleged Freetrade
Senators from N.S:W., also the Freetraders
Cook, Reid, Bowden, Fuller, Johnson, Wilks
and co. in the House of Representatives,-all want
Protection for the Lithgow' iron industry ; but if
they get it they will still denounce Protection as
a Curse, and they will still profess to regard
Deakin and his followers as a sort of harmless
idiot asylum because they fail to appreciate the
beauties of pure Freetrade; they will still
vituperate when any Victorian or Queensland or
S.A. industry gets Protection; and they will
still try to drive Deakin and co. out of
office for believing in Protection. Also they
will still demand special consideration for
N.S.W. in the matter of the Federal capital
and in other respects on account of the
“sacrifices” it made in giving up the Freetrade
it never possessed and never wanted. \ et, if the
Australian Government made an offer to, say.
Senator Walker that, if he would cease to demand
a capital right up against the backdoor of Sydney
by wav of compensation to N.S.W . for the loss of
“Freetrade,” the Government would grant the
blessing of absolute Freetrade, tarnished by neither
duties nor bonuses, to the Lithgow iron industry,
Senator Walker would probably be a very angry
man - *
It would be an absolutely logical situation if the
Australian Government and its following declared
that the Lithgow iron industry would get a liberal


bonus and high Protection provided N.S.W. re-
jects Senators Soapy Gray and Neild and Puls-
FORD at next election, and replaces them by Pro-
tectionists ; but that otherwise Lithgow would
get nothing—in fact, that wherever there was an
industry that could be defined as a purely
N.S.W. industry, the existing duties would
be taken off, and the State would get the Free-
trade it asked for. They might logically go even
further and make the Lithgow question depend-
ent on the rejection, for the Lithgow electorate,
of Freetrader Bowden and his replacement by a
Protectionist. Unfortunately, politics are largely
compromise, and there is little room in them for
the application of pure logic. But, because of the
utter lack of logic in the Freetrade argument, the
position which N.S.W. occupies in the House of
Reps, is wholly anomalous. N.S.W. ought to be
the greatest power in the Commonwealth, but it
has been something more akin to a Cave of
Adullam or a body of Ishmaelites against
whom every man’s hand is turned. The
obvious reason of this is the miserable and
disreputable influence of the alleged Freetrade
party and of the Sydney Freetrade papers.
Thanks to them, N.S.W. returns dreadful
characters like Wilks, and Wilks is a violent
Freetrader, who objects, because he is a Free-
trader, to Protection for everybody’s industry
save his own ; who demands high Protection for
every industry in his own electorate because he
says he is entitled to a share of any advantages
that are going ; who says Protection is a Curse,
and yet clamors for all the Curse he can get hold
of ; who alleges that Freetrade is a Blessing, yet
wants to give away all the Blessing to other
people ; who professes to regard Protectionists as
fools or lunatics, while reaching out for Protection
with both hands; who demands special concessions
for N.S.W. to make up for the loss of the Free-
trade it never had, and which Wilks would
sooner die than have ; and who is supported by
Freetrade papers which are still raving mad over
the loss of the 50 per cent. Protection they used
to enjoy under the old Freetrade postal system of
the old Separatist days. Too much Wilks is the
curse of N.S.W. And the existence of so much of
the Wilks variety of creature is a serious compli-
cation when a question like that of the Lithgow
iron industry comes to be considered.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Repudiation that Cheers.
An encouraging thing happened in the Australian
Parliament last week. Laborite Brown was
quoting against the REiD-ites some views recently
expressed by members of the Anti-Sosh Women’s
National League, when Anti-Soshite Dugald
Thomson interjected in a pained tone of voice.
He pointed out that Brown, M.P., was unjust.
He accused Brown of endeavoring “ to fasten on
the Opposition the extreme views of individuals.
Did Brown,” Thomson wound up, passionately,
“associate himself with the extreme views of
Tom Mann?” Brown hastened to own
that he would see himself boiled first, or
words to that effect, and the unpleasant-
ness simmered down. The leading lights
of the Anti-Sosh Women’s National League,
whose views Anti-Soshite Dugald Thomson has
thus shudderingly disowned, comprise what is
perhaps the last considerable body of human
being* that really believes in the gospel of Anti-
Sosh as originally delivered by G. Reid and his
press supporters. The average member of the
Women’s National League still persists in regard-
ing Industrial Arbitration, the new Protection, a
graduated Land Tax and Defence as AN ARCHY,
spelt in the largest type in the composing-room
—the sort that requires a man and a boy to carry
each letter. The majority of its members cling to
the theory that the return to power of Labor,
as personified by Fish-er, Watson & Co., must
result in a general and ear-splitting explosion of
marriage-lines. Also, the League holds for the
most part that Fisher, Watson, and their allies
stand for Atheism, the branding of children,
severance from Ma, and the ruination and de-
liberate jumping upon of the Flag. They believe
the Laborites hanker after these weird idiocies
(1) because they suspect that T. Mann, the
Cockney chain-burster, is in favor of them;
(2) because G. Reid and his press sup-
porters told them during the last Federal elec-
tion trouble that certain Socialists in Italy
or France or Sheol approved of such things.
Faced with the job of swallowing the doctrines of
the Anti-Sosh Women’s Leaguers, Anti-Soshite
Dugald Thomson got hot in the neckband and
chafed exceedingly. He grew as inarticulately
angry as some respectable Labor man who had just
endured a public accusation of being Ravachol,
or the assassinator of the Empress of Austria.
Thomson’s annoyance is, as already noted, en-
couraging. It indicates that the movement which
was started three years ago, with the object of
representing the followers of Andrew Fisher to
be criminal lunatics, has slumped badly. Plainly
the more intelligent “Anti-Socialists” are right
off political warfare of that sort. They are
ashamed of it, and, besides, experience has shown
that it doesn’t pay. In fact, when things come to
the point, they repudiate Miss Grace Watson
and all her push.
“Ye Woolbrokers.”
The best joke of the week was the letter of one
GeorgeL. Lethbridge, of Singleton, totheSydney
Telegraph. George discovered in the wastes of his
own mind that because N.S.W. has done Queens-
land and the other States out of any prospect of
having the capital in their territory, and has
insisted upon itself supplying the ground for the
capital to be built upon, therefore there is a
dark conspiracy afoot against N.S.W. to make it
supply ground for a capital. Said George, in
.strong hysterics :
Haveithe merchants, the woolbrokers, and public bodies
of (this State become so recreant, so mean-spirited, as to
.have lost all national respect ? Have they become so
-craven that they will prostrate themselves and let the
: -southern States ride roughshod over them ? If they are
now so indisposed to action, they will soon be convinced
• of their mistake. It does not require a mighty scrutiny
to detect the selfish illwill displayed by the southern
: States towards New South Wales throughout this Federal
• capital question. It is the unbounded duty of our mem-
. bers of Parliament of this State, the City Councillors,
the merchants, the woolbrokers, and all so interested, to
assist the Government to repress and protest against all
imposition and ignoble encroachment on our territory.
It is one thing to be discreetly generous, but another to
lavish valuable territory in a munificent spirit upon those
; States, which take all but give nothing Where are
you, ye Members of Parliament, ye City Councillors, ye
Boards of Commerce, ye Sydney merchants, YE SYDNEY
WOOLBROKERS, ye Boards and bank directors, that no
protest has been raised against such imposition, with prob-
able sacrifice of territory and loss of trade ?
■George has all the earmarks of a pastoralistand a
virulent Tory and Freetrader. Only a jumbuck
t merchant would have such a passionate faith in
- the omnipotence of woolbrokers that he would
. call on them thrice, like the Lord calling Samuel,
< to rise and saye the State. And only a Free-
trader could be convinced, as George plainly is,
that merchants, woolbrokers, and bank directors
run the country, and that manufacturers, artisans
and such-like don’t count. He doesn’t appeal to
manufacturers and artisans. They are naught.
Bat the bitterness of his invocation to “ye
Sydney woolbrokers ” to rise and hit the
southern States hard on the ear will re-
verberate down the corridors of Time like the
voice of a madman shouting into a drain pipe,
and the echoes thereof will wander afar, even as a
small, lame devil might if he lost himself at night
on the Old Man Plain.
A Bill and a Row.
The bitter fight which the N.S.W. Labor party
put up in the Assembly against Premier Wade’s
Contagious Diseases Bill was one of the most un-
accountable proceedings in its history. As a rule
it is a party which keeps fairly clear of cant, but
that night it seemed to go mad, and it propped
up the cause of disease with all the old stock plati-
tudes of the pietists and the bun-strugglers. The
trouble which Premier Wade’s measure is in-
tended to check is so dreadful and so disastrous
that almost any device that will prevent its dis-
semination is justifiable. The person affected is
a public danger capable of spreading his complaint
in a hundred ways which have nothing at all to
do with the conventional immorality of which
pietists make so much. Also he, or she,
may hand it down to the second, if
not the third, generation, and give to
the world infected children, stunted, skinny and
shrivelled, with an aspect that is half old man and
half old monkey, with shrunken features, snuffling
voices, flabby bones, notched teeth, and glassy,
staring eyes. The right of the community to take
strong measures for the segregation and compul-
sory treatment of people with this disease,
especially when there is reason to believe that
they are themselves taking no adequate measures
to avoid being a danger to the community, is
beyond all question. In fact it is not merely the
community’s right, but the community’s duty.
The “liberty of the subject” doesn’t come in in
such a case. But certain lamentable pietists have
vague ideas about righteous retribution and such
things. They almost want to preserve the disease
that it may be a judgment upon the sinner who
doesn’t tread the narrow track that leads to the
bun-struggle, and walk the chalk-line which is the
road to choir practice. The fact that it may also
be a judgment upon many people who are not
sinners of the sort alluded to is a side issue of no
importance. When a certain brand of sincere but
narrow piety gets on such subjects as the age of
consent, the tote, the liquor question and con-
tagious disease it seems to lose its mental balance
and run wild. And when it runs wild it is really
amazing how wild it runs.

Benjamin Ananias.
Ben Tillett, that very useless and loosely-
eloquential English labor shouter, has been at it
again, and either he has been amazingly misre-
presented or else he is a horrible and most vicious
liar. The following is said to have been part of a
letter written by Benjamin to the London Daily
Mail about the condition of Victoria :
Mr. Bent does not attempt to deal with rhy letter, but
expresses opinions that he cannot justify in Parliament,
and which would be repudiated by the responsible legis-
lators of the State. It is now close upon five months
since I left the colony, which was in a prosperous state,
if we are to take Mr. Bent’s word, and the same chal-
lenge was thrown out re the unemployed ; a few names
were asked for. When 500 were submitted, Mr. Bent,
who was erratic and irresponsible, literally ran away from
the deputation.
I reiterate the previous statement that 100,000 men,
women and children are in a state of destitution. There
are 8000 or 9000 children dying every year for want of
food under the age of five. In the Williamstown and Port
Melbourne industrial areas men are glad to get work at
£1 per week and odd jobs at 4s. per day.
Now the Victorian death-rate among infants is
pretty bad for Australia —worse than that of
N.S.W., Queensland, S.A. or Tasmania. Yet in
Victoria in 1906 there were only 4511 deaths of
persons under 20 years, and how 8000 or 9000
children under the age of five could die of starva-
tion and be crowded into 4511 only a lunatic can
tell. In all the Commonwealth during the six
years 1901-1906 there were 77,127 deaths of children
aged under five years, or an average of 12,854 per
annum, and if about 9000 of the 12,854 died of
hunger in the one little State of Victoria the
point could hardly have escaped observation, for
every child who died in Victoria must have
perished more than twice over and perished of
hunger each time. Therefore there is some justi-
fication for the view that this Benjamin who does
no useful work—the loafing Benjamin who lives on
his jaw and other people’s earnings—is a vicious
and depraved per verter whose exit would make the
world a trifle cleaner than it is. If any La,bor or
trades-union or other political organisation invites
Tillett out here again after this experience, or
gives the blatant Benjamin any encouragement or
recognition should he arrive here “on his own,”
it will deserve the hatred and disgust of every
true Australian. Meanwhile it would be a fair
thing for the Deakin Ministry to hurry up with
a little Bill on the Canadian plan, prescribing
heavy fine and imprisonment for persons who
publish gross and damaging slanders on this
country. That wouldn’t reach Benjamin in
England, but it would make sure that his cell
would be ready for him when he transpired again
on these shores, if he ever did so.

A Badly-Needed Measure.
Hughes, M.L.C., has given notice of his intention
to introduce what the Sydney Moening Herald
(29/10/’08) calls “a Bill to make the life of motor-
ists miserable.” It might more justifiably be
called a Bill to make the life of non-motorists
bearable. It is a question of the point of view. If
the proposed measure gets on to the Statute Book
it is calculated to considerably hamper the road-
swine in his hoggishness. It provides, for one
thing, that all motor-cars and motor-cycles shall
be plainly numbered. It is an anomaly that the
Law did not compel owners of motor-cars in Aus-
tralia to mark their juggernauts for identification
years ago. In the United Kingdom, in Con-
tinental Europe, and in America cars must be
numbered, so that he who runs, or runs from, or
is run over by them, may read, and later on iden-
tify their propellers. Experience shbws that this
acts as a powerful deterrent to scorching. Drivers
as well as cars will be registered if the Hughes
measure passes, and drastic provisions have been
inserted regarding the showing of lights at night,
the affixing of alarms and brakes, and the regula-
tion of speed. This last is the matter that calls
most loudly for treatment. The row that flared
up among owners and drivers when the N.S.W.
police authorities announced, three months
back, that they would “ deal firmly ” with reckless
driving in and out of the city of Sydney has quite
died down. Outside the thickly-policed heart of
the city itself there is little pretence made by
drivers of keeping within a safe or even rational
speed limit. On the Bayswater and New South
Head roads, right out to South Head, and along
the streets of the various Points which they pass,
the motor-hog is borne daily and hourly at an ex-
cessive speed, and none says him nay. And in
the more distant suburbs, and in the country
where no one even knows him by sight,
the hog opens out and lets his lethal vehicle
have its head without 'any pretence at law-
abidingness. There are a heap of easilv-under-
standable reasons why mere police “regulations”
will never avail much with the wealthy motorist
who takes pleasure in speeding. His is a case
that needs the weight of an Act which shall give
power to those prejudiced to call for the summary
arrest of the negligent and furious driver, and
bring the offenders thereafter a stiff term in gaol.
There are other habits dear to the road-hog that
require scotching—his destructive practice of
spraying clouds of dust to right and left as he
whizzes past, his passion for needlessly throwing
out an evil mist of oil-smoke from the exhaust-
pipe of his car, and so forth. But they are trivial
things in comparison with the rapidly-growing
speed curse. It is the curse which needs to be
chased with a gun.

A Dead Harbor.
Victoria’s Thos. Bent had a gleam of intelli-
gence one day a little while ago. A deputation
proposed that the railway from the Western
harbor of Portland should be extended for 100
miles due north, so that the exportable produce of
a large district might take a short cut to Portland
Bay and be shipped there, instead of trailing
wearily and endlessly over the interminableness
of Tait’s railways to Melbourne, to be put
on a vessel at Hobson’s Bay, and then carried
past Portland on the back track to Europe. And
Bent said “ Hooray ” or “Yep,” or words to that
effect; in fact, he said he would do it. All the
same, this paper bets that Bent won’t do it. The
influence of congested Melbourne, which wants
everything dragged to Yarra-side, will tell Bent
to reconsider his position. He is a very weak old
man nowadays, and a caterpillar is liable to be too
much for him. Portland Bay has been described as
“ one of the loveliest on earth ” and as “capable
of affording anchorage to the largest fleet in the
world.” Yet Melbourne, on a muddy river that
plods sadly into a very unsatisfactory bay, has
been able to kill Portland so dead that its popular
tion in 1901 was only 2185 people. If; had 2284
people in 1891, so it is a dying town with its
chances behind it, unless something is done, Yet
it is a very old settlement, and its principal local
paper, the Guardian, is now aged 66 years. The
great possibilities of Portland have been sup-
pressed by the grasping instincts of Melbourne,
just as those of Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay have
been by Sydney. The best hope for Australia’s
lost ports appears to lie in the transfer of the whole
railway system to the Commonwealth. A legis-
lature which wasn’t dominated by Melbourne .
might be able to recognise the claims of Portland,
just as one which wasn’t dominated by Sydney
might realise the need for a railway to carry the,
produce of Riverina to Twofold Bay. The railway
systems of Australia’s two most populous States,
have been a costly burnt offering to the selfishness,
and vanity of Melbourne and Sydney—especially
Melbourne. But Bent isn’t the man to put things:
right. His heart is with the cabbages at Brighton,,
and Brighton looks across Hobson’s Bay, and!
Hobson’s Bay is Bent’s horizon.

Sydney University and “ Home-made
Professors.
“ A Man from Inside ” sends a complaiufcr—-
The action of the Senate of the Sydney Uiraiivei-sity if#
the matter of the Chair of Chemistry amounts, te a. piatec
scandal. Obsessed by a fear that mere Austiialliaii, Wutins
might have the teaching of the budding scientists»f the
Ma State, or swayed out of reason by jealousy of Mel-
bourne (it is hard to say which of the two, discreditable
motives predominated), these “ leadersofi ligh t and learn-
ing ” rejected with scorn their expert comiiuittee’s recom-
mendation of a highly qualified Melbourne man for the
vacant seat, and appointed an admittedly inferior appli-
cant, whose strongest claim appears to have been that he
was not an Australian.
The nominee of the Committee was Dr. B. D. Steele, a
Melbourne University graduate, now lecturer and demon-
strator in chemistry there. His course as a student was
brilliant, and was crowned with one of the coveted 1851-
Exhibition scholarships that gave him residence in Eng-
land and Germany for three years. After that he held
appointments in Canada and Scotland. The committee
that chose him out of 15 applicants consisted of four
Professors of Chemistry—Sir William Ramsay (University
College, London), Dr. W. A. Tilden (Royal College ok
Science, London), Dr. A. Cr.um Brown (Edinburgh UrvU.
versity), and H. B. Dixon (Victoria University, M.-ai-
chester). They placed a Dr. G. T. Morgan, Demon.struftu,.
of the Royal College of Science, London, second, g,|id |
Dr. J. W. Mellor, of Staffordshire Technical School,
third. Steele was in Australia, so he was not interviewed, ’
as were the others, but he and his work were well know n ]
to the selectors. The vice-chancellor of Sydney. Univer-.
sity (in the Gold Country on a trip) and the. N.S.W.,
Agent-General were parties to the choice.
It was with holy horror that the Senate received thee
nomination. A local scholar and, worst of all, a Mel-
bourne man ! Two meetings were held, at the second off
which ex-Prof. Liversidge was present, and made a*
strong appeal for Morgan, a student of the school he hadl
graduated from. Not all of the Senate, however, wane-
lost to a sense of decency, and the voting was even, foir
Steele and Morgan, whereupon the Chancellor tuimedi
down his thumb to the Melbournian.
The post was accordingly offered to Morgan, who re-
fused it. Naturally then it. reverted to Steele? Not at
all. The Senate was exhausted by its want of sleep, and
the anti-Australian party succeeded in getting a motion
through to call for fresh applications.
The expert committee was too sore to be approached
again, so five old-world Universities were asked (semi-
privately) to name each a graduate. Only one responded t
(Glasgow), and it put up a Dr. Charles Edward Fawsitt,
who had nominated previously and had only been included !
in the “ other starters.” Steele applied also, and the com- -
petition lay between him, the Scot, and a Sydney oandi- •
date. Fawsitt’s reputation was that of a well-liked main
socially, but his status as a scientist could not place him.
in the first four at the initial choosing, and it was known/
that Steele had previously beaten him (on his native
heath) for an assistant professorship at the Heriot Watt
College, Edinburgh.
Fawsitt got the vote.
And the effect of all this? Simply that Australians are
driven out of their own country to get a living. Early
this year a Maoriland chair was advertised with the pro-
viso that tlie applicants must possess British degrees.
No local men need apply. Even when an outside tri-
bunal of the world’s greatest experts chose an Australian,
an Australian University could be found to reject him.
What encouragement is off, red to an Australian to climb
the academic ladder? His reward is that of the prophet in
his own country : to succeed he must expatriate himself.
Surely it is not too much to ask that Australian brains!
should receive the recognition that other Australian pro-,
ducts are deservedly winning. The day of apology for ■
local productions has departed, and it is more than time,
that the ancients of our Universities realised that there is.
no reasonable excuse for their own existence if the train--
ing they give and the degrees they confer have only thee
value—or rather the utter want of value —they them*,
selves place upon them in the open market.
A State Coal Mine.
Encouraged by the success cyf the State's Cold
Storage Works and similar enterprises, the Price
Government in South Australia has decided to,
have its own coal mine. Unfortunately it doesn't
seem to have a hope of developing one within its
own territory; away up in the Far North, ats
Leigh’s Creek, there is something that is like-
coal, but it is poor stuff to carry-, and is too far
away for use in the south. So the Price Minis-
try turns to N. S. Wales; having got an
option over some freehold og. the Maitland field
it proposes to spend first £20,000 on buying the
land and then another £85,000 in turning it into
a mine. Already, during the last few months,
a bore lias been put down 1300 odd feet’
and within the last fortnight has proved
the upper seam ; so there is no doubt
that the place can be turned into a mine, though
whether £85,000 will see it through depends upon
the sort of luck the State has in its new enter-
prise. Still, a neighbor, the Heddon Greta, whose
luck has been pretty bad, has achieved an output
of from 25,000 to 30,000 tons in six months on a
capital (including borrowings) of under £70,000 ;
and in the Heddon Greta case the mine purchase
cost the company £25,000. Whether what is offered
to S. Aus. is a good bargain is, however, a matt £
for the experts ; the point of public interest is Re-
purchase by the State of a coal mine. By,
amazing and continued piece of folly N. S.
has not retained and worked a colliery o ff
its own, notwithstanding the enormous r .uawfntw
of coal consumed on the railways, and notwith-
standing that the railways (and, throng Is, the
railways, the producers) are at the of any
coal vend or combine that may be formed. This
in fact, was one of the troubles that was at the
bottom of the row which awhile ago resulted in
the smashing up of the old N.S. W. Railway Com-
mission ; that keen, far-seeing man, Charles
Oliver, wanted to give a contract to a coal mine
that was outside the Lithgow combine in order to
keep competition alive, and over that the Com-
missioners split. The N.S.W. State railways are
by far the biggest consumer of coal in N. S.
Wales; they could easily keep two mines
going—one in the north and another in the
west. Notwithstanding that, they depend
upon the private collieries, and help the
latter to pay their dividends. They put into
other pockets profits which ought to Vie kept in
the department’s own money-box. The other big
buyers of coal are the shipping cos.; but they are
not such fools as to do, what the railways have
been doing—if they don’t own a mine or two
entirely, they gradually mop up a big interest in
one ay wove. Thus the Howard Smith people
are heavily interested in the Caledonian and
other collieries, aud only a few months ago the Ade-
laide Steamship Co. bought a big block of the
North Bulli. S. Australia is, no doubt, rather
differently circumstanced; it has to depend on.,
the inter-State steamship cos. to get coal round.
How Long, O Lord, How Long?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A song— a little song—of a country, of Australia ;
Of a Continent, vast and all-embracing, set in the
all-embracing sea ;
Of a Land prepared for a People, and of a People
not prepared for anything.
A song of cities at contention together, and of
councillors brought to confusion.
Yet among them there be men of discernment and
determination,
But they are scattered and not united, for they
lack a Leader—
Yea, there needs must come forth a Man to direct
this people—
A Man having Fire—
And Vision—
And Audacity—
And Tenacity—
A Man with a spirit of flame and a will of iron ;
One whose Purpose is unshakable as the Great
Pyramid.
For him a Continent, distracted and in danger,
waits as a mother expectant for her babe ;
How long , 0 Lord, how long l
A song—a little song—of a Ship becalmed, and of
a crew without a captain ;
A song of Australia in the Doldrums—of the good
ship Commonwealth rolling, helpless, in the
sea of Events;
A song of a very big Ship sailing illimitable and
perilous seas—
A song of a very small crew, most of whom are
sleeping below;
Yet some are on deck, watching anxiously the
dark and threatening horizon ;
Others, lying snug under the bulwarks, are play-
ing cards, or twining colored ribands, or
thrumming upon banjos ;
At the wheel is one trying to fetch the Ship into a
slant of wind ;
Peradventure he might succeed; but behold!
upon his right pants one striving to starboard
the helm, now hard-a-port;
And, see ! there upon the left are two struggling
to unship the groaning wheel!
And all are squabbling mightily together,
Sending forth foolish, varying and contradictory
orders to the few seamen who pace the deck
bewildered;
There is a storm, black upon the North horizon—
Possibly (for in these high seas no man knows
what an hour may bring forth) pirates are
lurking in the thickness to the West—
Several waterspouts are circling about the Ship—
The waves shine ominously as they roll by in oily
and phosphorescent magnificence—
The faint sounds in the air are suggestive of a
hurricane unpleasantly near ;
Still, most of the crew sleeps on comfortably
below, and the twanging of banjos does not
cease;
Neither are the cards and ribands put down.
The frenetic individuals, at, near, or round the
wheel continue their remarkable gyrations
and orations;
The Ship lurches and staggers over the uneasy
sea;
Clearly it is time to call a Captain—
Let him be a big man, a bold man, a burly man—
A belaying-pin-rope’s-end-and-marling-spike-using
man,
A Captain not pious, nor polite, nor considerate;
A Captain who will knock down the squabbling
stragglers and have All Hands on Deck in less
than thirty-five seconds ;
A Captain who will put the Ship on her course
and set or take in sail at need—
Where is there such a Captain ?
He is somewhere about and should be called ;
No, he is not asleep, but busily engaged in some
secret part of the Ship.
Will he come on deck ?
He will.
Heaven send him up before the storm breaks or
the pirates rush out of the haze !
How long, O Lord, how long '!

Among the many pleasant drinks of the present
century we find none more palatable than the well-known
Danish Cherry Brandy. This is distilled from the native
cherries that grow profusely in the Copenhagen districts,
which have a peculiar flavor that imparts the distinct
characteristics that have made the Copenhagen Cherry
Brandy outstrip all others in public favor, and that dis-
tilled by Mr. Peter F. Heering is undoubtedly the best
and commands the largest business throughout the
world. The manufacture of this liqueur commenced early
in the last century in a small way, being merely for home
consumption, but its excellence soon brought it into
prominence, and there is not a country in the world where
the blue and chocolate label is not to be seen. tilth a
little cold water no drink is more reviving on a hot
summer’s day ; as a liqueur no other leaves a more pleasant
taste on the palate.*
from the N.S.W. port to Adelaide; and the inter-
state carrier has mostly also been the State’s coal
supplier. Whether the inter-State carriers
will be prepared to quote reasonable
rates for carrying alone remains to be
seen; if not, then S. Australia will have to
run a collier of its own—just as the Colonial
Sugar Refining Co. runs a sugar boat of
its own. These, however, are details for future
arrangement; the thing to be faced immediately
is the opposition which is offered to the Price
Government’s proposal to buy the mine property.
This opposition, it is surprising to find, comes, in
a measure, from a section of the Labor party,
which says that this isn’t Socialism —it is State
capitalism, like the State produce stores. But
this is merely playing with words. The simple
fact is that, as long as the Government runs the
railways and other similar undertakings, it must
have coal; and the question is whether it is going
to put the profit on the supply of coal for ever
into private owners’ pockets, or whether it is
going to save those profits for the benefit of the
people who use the railways and the other undertak-
ings, and for the benefit of the general taxpayer
who has to make good the deficit if the railways
are run at a loss.
The New Bent Ministry.
The mystery of Australia these days is the Bent
Ministry that dwells in Melbourne. It repre-
sents hopelessness, paralysis and fatuousness
such as no other Ministry in Australia’s history
was ever accused of. Its chief is a noisy, un-
lettered, uncivil roarer who sings comic songs and
tells amazing tales about the 25 or more occupa-
tions he says he followed in his youth. He com-
menced the session with a stupendous list of pro-
mises, not one of which has been fulfilled. He
has thrown overboard at the first sign of serious
opposition every measure of the slightest im-
portance. He has been deserted in succession by
every man of any weight in his Cabinet. Some of
them have just gone, and some went earlier. Mur-
ray threw his resignation in the face of his blunder-
ing, abject, uncivil chief in the Assembly, and
when the reporters waited on Bent afterwards for
particulars that amazing clown is said to have re-
plied by singing scraps of a silly music-hall chorus
with something in it about “ re-tooral ” or “ ri-
tiddly-um.” Samuel Gillott, who at least lent
an air of seriousness and gravity to the show, left
and went disgustedly out of politics. Peacock
quitted the sinking ship a little while ago. So did
MacKinnon. So did “ strong man ” Swinburne.
So, in fact, did everybody except three harmless
barnacles. The discredited leader was left to
clown it, to all intents and purposes, on his soli-
tary own. Yet Bent hangs on. He secured an
adjournment of Parliament for three weeks,
which probably means that there will be no work
done this session at all. He went to the Country
party—the body which virtually tore up his Land
Valuation Bill, the one big item which he had
attempted out of all the session’s programme, and
aimed the fragments at his eye—and offered it
almost the whole Ministerial job, bar the
Premiership. That means, of course, that
the Lands Valuation Bill, the various closer
settlement schemes and promises—in fact,
everything of any importance in the alleged
Bent programme—is to be sacrificed. It
means, too, that the shameless cadge of the
country local government bodies for grants from
the Treasury to savetherich landownerfrom paying
rates will be made a- more shameless cadge than
ever. Apparently Bent would publicly eat fried
dog if he could thereby avoid the loss of office ;
and he would certainly eat dirt—in fact, he has
eaten so much that one would think he must be
about full of dirt now. Bent, abandoned by every
colleague of importance, and with his programme
dropped (or kicked) overboard, resumes business
■ at the tail-end of an utterly barren session, with a
team of nonentities gathered up from among the
men who, a week or two ago, practically gave him
notice to either back down or quit. And the
painful nature of the situation doesn’t seem to
affect him in the least. He is Thomas Bent, and
that accounts for everything.

Fish.
Last week Sydney Telegraph published an item
from its London correspondent which should have
made it blush right down to its imported boots.
An extract read as follows :
NO MOKE STINKING PISH.
A few years ago it was fashionable to cry stinking fish
about the Commonwealth. That peculiar pastime was
indulged in not only by the residents of Great Britain,
but very many Australians were adepts at it. It was
fashionable for men sufficiently prominent in the Com-
monwealth to get space in the London press to come over
here and declare to the world that their country was going
to the dogs. The simple truth was that these men were
carried away by political partisanship, and in their dis-
appointment at the way things were moving in Australia
they went to the extent of maligning the country gene-
rally. Happily that time is over. The stinking fish party
is dead. It has become fashionable again for the Austra-
lian in London to stand up for his country, and almost
without exception the men one meets travelling on this
side are notorious by their advocacy of the Common-
wealth.
It was The Bulletin which christened the vil-
lainous slanderers of the Telegraph-Herald-
Argus crowd the Stinking Fish party, and the
name has stuck. There were three or four awful
years when the Six Hatters lie, and the Petriana
murder lie, and the lie about Mrs. Tozer’s maid,
and the lies about how all immigrants were shut out
of this country, and how the land was ruined by
Protection, and how all freedom was obliterated
by the Labor party, were spread industriously by
these three papers and other papers like them ;
and every friend of theirs who went to England
filled up the English papers and people with the
most unspeakable falsehoods concerning Australia.
It was at the time of the first Deakin Ministry
(Deakin was understood to be the man who
drowned the Petriana sailors) that the campaign
was at its worst. Yet Deakin survived politi-
cally. His splendid speeches in England killed the
' Stinking Fish party dead. His patriotic attitude
there shamed the wandering Australian Tory into
the habit of “standing up for his country.” Even
the Telegraph is now driven to calling its
old disreputable self and its old disreputable
friends Stinking Fish. And as for the
principal Stinking Fishermen—such men as
Puls ford, Zeal, McMillan. Conroy, Johnson,
Kelly, Reid, Knox, Lonsdale, McEacharn, the
two Smiths of N.S.W. , Wilks and their kind—
there isn’t one of them in office, and quite a lot
have sunk out of sight, discredited and played-out.
Now the Telegraph says that the Stinking Fish
party is dead. It ought to know. The party
included no larger or older Fish than the Tele-
graph.

The Navigation Bill Trouble.
The Australian Navigation Bill, which has hung
fire for years and been a source of worry and
dispute with the British Government all that
time, is now going through the Senate in an
amended form, and is still a source of worry and
dispute. The British Government has sent a
broad hint that the measure will be vetoed if
passed in its present form, or in any form that
will be worth a copper to Australia. The purport
of the Bill is to enact that Australian ships shall
observe certain rules as to sailors’ wages, food and
accommodation, and other matters; and that
British and foreign ships, while trading between
Australian ports, shall do likewise. The British
or foreign ship which comes straight from its own
port to Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
Hobart or Fremantle, and doesn’t attempt to
carry passengers or cargo from one Australian
port to another, won’t be affected. It
isn’t proposed that the British or foreign craft
should be put at the slightest disadvantage as
compared with the Australian ship. There is no
idea of Protection to local industry in the
case. All that is proposed is that the Aus-
tralian ship should not be at a disadvant-
age in its own waters as compared with
its British and foreign rivals. No one suggests
that Australia should proceed to build up a local
marine by the high-handed methods which Britain
adopted when it built its merchant navy under
the old Navigation Laws. But Britain, having
built up its own merchant navy under almost the
most rigidly Protective laws the world ever
saw, now reckons it is so far ahead of
all competitors that it can do without Navigation
Laws, so it objects to Australia trying, in a
much milder fashion, to assist its own mercantile
navy. The conditions Britain provides for its
own sailors are so w 7 retched that the Englishman
is deserting the sea, and his place is being taken
by Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, Spaniards,
Portuguese, Greeks, Italians, Arabs, South
Americans and all manner of sundries; and
Britain lays down the law that Australia must
either run its own mercantile marine on the terms
which are driving John Bull off the sea, or else
it must allow the Australian mercantile marine to
be killed quite dead through British and foreign
ships being allowed to trade on the Australian
coast under cheap conditions with which the Aus-
tralian steamship companies can’t compete.
When Britain was only beginning to build up its
sea commerce, it found rigid Navigation Lavvs
absolutely essential, but because it reckons that it
doesn’t find them essential now, when its sea com-
merce is built, it professes itself quite unable to
understand why acountry, which is justinthecondi-
tion which Britain occupied 250 years ago,, should
require anything of the kind. On this subject the
Asquith Government grew large and supercilious
in an official despatch, in which it said :
The experience which the Imperial Government pos-
sesses in matters of the kind is far greater than that
possessed by any Australian Government can possibly be.
It is a large, beautiful, supercilious English state-
ment, and it is very silly. The experience of a
Government, Imperial or otherwise, is mostly the
experience of the men in that Government. Prime
Minister Asquith, of Britain, has had 22 years’
Parliamentary experience; the Parliamentary
experience of Prime Minister Deakin, of
Australia, covers 29 years. Lloyd-George, the
British Chancellor of the Exchequer, has been 18
years in Parliament; William Lyne, Treasurer of
Australia, has been 28 years in politics, and
was a Minister, battling along with an infini-
tesimal majority, five years before Lloyd-George
first found a constituency to return him. But in
another respect the Australian Government has
some 248 years more experience than the Asquith
Government possesses. It is struggling to create
a mercantile marine, just as Britain was when it
passed the famous Navigation Laws of 1660, by
which no vessel might import goods into Britain
or any British dependency unless it were British
owned, and three-fourths of its officers and crew
were British. Australia doesn’t propose anything
one-tenth so drastic as that, but it keeps an eye on
the precedent none the less. And Prime Minister
Asquith, and his Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Lloyd-George, would require to be 300 years old
to know as much of this especial subject as Deakin
and Lyne do. To understand the necessity for
creating a local mercantile marine, and the diffi-
culties in the way, and the measures that are
required, which are the subjects that Deakin and
Lyne are struggling with, Asquith and Lloyd-
George should have lived in Cromwell’s days.
Being born, instead, in the days when, through
the energy of great men now dead, the work had
been done, they are mere theorists on the subject.
♦
There is a proposal abroad that a Federal Com-
mission should be appointed “to inquire into the
possibilities of white settlement in tropical Aus-
tralia.” It is a foolish idea, with no possible end
to serve Save the waste of precious time and the
scattering of money. The position of tropical
Australia can go into these three propositions :
(1) White settlement has proved itself for many years to
be not only possible but eminently successful, and it is
still proving itself so. It doesn't require any Commission
to spend months examining witnesses to find out that.
The facts can be ascertained by the map and the census
reports and other cheap and handy documents.
(2) We must protect the North against invasion by the
aid of white men whether they can stand the climate or
not. They are the only reliable men we have got or can
get.
(3) If, despite all the experience which goes to prove
that white men can live and work and be healthy in the
North, it should be demonstrated later, in some incredible
fashion, that they can’t, the fact will come out by ex-
perience and in no other way. All the theoretical inquiry
on earth is of no value in such a case. It would be almost
as practical to appoint a committee to inquire into and
report on what it feels like to be dead.
The proposed Commission of inquiry may serve
as an excuse for postponing the taking over of the
Northern Territory, the building of the trans-
continental railroad, and the garrisoning of the
exposed North with a strong white population,
and in general for sleeping a little longer while
dangers and enemies multiply, but it can’t serve
,any other purpose. It is a treasonable device
from first to last, and from the extremity of
its horns to the sole of its cloven hoof. If
Britain, when the Indian Mutiny broke out,
had appointed a learned and long-winded com-
mittee to inquire whether India was a healthy
place for white soldiers to go to, India would
have been lost; and the folly of appointing a
committee to inquire whether our North is a good
place for white men to go to is just the same kind
of folly. White men must go there if the place
isn’t to be ultimately lost, and it can’t be lost
without a probability, that is almost a certainty,
of the South being lost also. That is a position
which tons of inquiry will never alter.
S.M. Her ald lately “opened its pages,”as one of its
correspondents says, “to the large and important
question of naval defence.” In one recent issue it
printed five letters, filling columns of its “ valu-
able space,” and two out of the five were in favor
of a local naval force; while one “Edward W.
East,” while scouting the idea of an Australian
owned and controlled fleet, clamored for better
defended ports. Here is a gem :
The defences of Port Jackson, Botany, and our chief
coaling port of Newcastle must be overhauled at once by
an expert artillery and engineer officer imported specially
for the purpose.
Where in the world is he to be found ? The whole
of the existing works were planned by presumably
expert engineers. To begin with, there was
Governor Denison, who was an engineer General
of the highest reputation; he planned the fort
that bears his name. Then there was the
Jervois-Scratchley combination of two shining
lights, specially imported for the very purpose.
Finally, there was General Schaw, sent out to
report on the work of all the others, and he said
it was all very good. How often are these over-
haulings to take place, aud who is to guarantee
the expertness of the overhauler ? It might sur-
prise Mr. East to know that the Germans are •
keeping up on their Rhine frontier an old fortress
that was designed by Vauban, who died nearly
200 years ago.
' «
An accident which happened up on the Peel
River estate, the other day, showed the kind of
thing that may happen to a man in some of the
most fertile country in Australia—-also it shows
the sort of thing that may happen to the most
fertile country. The Peel River estate has for 52
years belonged to the Peel River Land Co., which
is an offshoot of the A. A. Co., one of the earliest
land-grabbers in this continent. Between them
the two cos. have held the country for the bigger
part of a century ; and on most of it they have
done nothing but graze a few sheep. Lately the
N.S.W. Government decided to resume 100,000
acres of it; and, in view of those proceedings,
the co. got Edward MacFarlane, ex-Under
Secretary for Lands, to go up and value it.
While on that job he was viewing the country
in a sulky, when the vehicle was upset,
and driver and valuer were thrown out. The
driver, after gathering some of his scattered
senses, had to walk eight miles before he could
find anybody to render help; and MacFarlane,
who had a broken arm, a dislocated shoulder and
other bad injuries, wandered in a dazed condition
all night, and was only found by a search party at
11 o’clock the next day. That happened on one
of the most fertile estates in Australia —in a part
of the country which hardly knows what droughts
are, and where 20-bushel harvests don’t cause
much surprise. That country ought to be teem-
ing with people ; yet one injured man can wander
eight miles before he finds a soul to help
him, and another one can wander all night
and half of the next day, and even then
he has to be found by a search party, as
though he were in a desert or a wilderness—
which to a great extent he was, thanks to the big-
landlord curse. Yet presumably the co. had got
Edward MacFarlane up with a view to show-
ing that the country where a man can meet with
an accident, and not find help in less than eight
miles, is really most fertile country, and worth
nothing less than £8 or £lO an acre, even taking
the bad with the good.

“A Miner’s Trust,” which was born at
Sydney Palace Theatre on Saturday night last,
advertises itself as
A Drama of Thrilling, Exciting and Sensational Inci-
dents of the Early Days of life on the Australian Gold-
fields.
And, after all, it is the same old bogus-Aus-
tralian play. It is one part stage-Australian and
three parts stage-Engiish. The hero makes
enough money in Australia during the prologue
to enable him to go to England ; the play proper
finds him settled permanently in the land which
is the Mecca of his kind. The indigenous drama
that isn’t compounded from the point of view of an
absentee landlord has yet to be written.
• * * *
The plot of the new production is in-
volved. Alan Trengrove and Jack Howard are,
to quote the programme, “ young Englishmen,
alike as peas.” For ten weary years they have
been gold-mining together op the Red Hill Dig-
gings (Vie.). They strike it rich, and start with
cries of joy for the Mother Country. The capital
halts for the night on its way out of the country
at a bush shanty. In a roar of polysyllables
Howard describes to Trengrove the beauty and
worth of Alice Medway, to whom he (Howard)
had become engaged in England a decade pre-
viously. Trengrove responds in a few well-
chosen words. The worthy fellows “shake”
emotionally, and retire to bedrooms, on
the prompt and O.P. sides of the stage,
respectively. Enter Gaspard Le Rouge, who
looks his name. Gaspard, after a brief chat with
Howard anent finance, shoots the latter and
departs. Trengrove appears, and the Palace cal-
cium expert discloses the fact that Gaspard has
employed either a soft-nosed projectile or a bomb.
An immense and gory cavity gapes in Howard.
He takes very long to die, but the time at length
arrives when the village doctor must remove the
hat which he has kept on for the purpose, and
gaze reverentially aloft. A weird inspiration seizes
Trengrove. Inserting his head into the patch of
limelight which appertains properly to Howard,
he uncovers and makes the following statement:
You gave me my life, partner —now I’m going to give it
back to you. I swear that I will go to England—l will
marry the girl you loved, and she shall never know that I
am not the man I seem to be.
Whereupon Howard drops dead, and the curtain
falls as though stupefied. Then we find Alan
Trengrove masquerading as Howard on the Eng-
lish premises of Captain Medway, R.N. Alan’s
position takes some unravelling. Honor, his
plighted word, a miner’s trust, and so forth bind
him to Alice; yet the girl of his choice is her
cousin Ida, daughter of Medway, R.N. A viper
in his path is his cousin Arthur Trengrove.
Arthur adores Ida with all the 40-h.p. passion of
the thoroughly bad man ; moreover he has laid
claim to an estate which Alan has inherited
from an uncle in foreign parts. And Alan, in his
rdle of Howard, has had to represent himself as
being an intestate corpse. This unsatisfying
state of things lasts for some months, and then
the mail-steamer Goulburn goes ashore about
Medway’s front lawn with Gaspard Le Rouge on
its passenger-list. Alan rescues Gaspard ; the
gaff concerning the salvager’s identity is blown ;
Alice hands him a full discharge of his promise of
marriage to her; Ida accepts him; Arthur
bereft both of Ida and of Alan’s inheritance—hisses
“Ah-r-r,” likewise “G-r-r,” and flees “behind, ’
amid the callous jeers of the multitude.
* * * *
Conway Wingfield does as well as can be
expected in the part of Alan Trengrove. Alan is
handicapped with speeches that bear a depressing
resemblance to public addresses. As a moribund,
he is wearisome. His death-scene clamors for the
pruner’s axe. Lilian Myers is an imposing and
gorgeously-frocked Ida, and Lorna Forbes is
effective as the afflicted Alice. James Lindsay
makes Arthur Trengrove a very repellent
scoundrel. James possesses a scowl and a blight-
ing sneer. The comic relief, which has nothing
whatever to do with the main action of the piece,
is rather above the average.

The Hooks have been withdrawn—like-
wise the bait and berley that surrounded them —
from Sydney Criterion, and on Saturday next the
National Opera Go. will try its luck in the same
waters. The management will open what it terms
fruitily “its Sydney season of musical romance
and delightful old-time melody"’ with what it
describes lusciously as “ the evergreen and en-
chanting opera, ‘Maritana.’ ’ The co. contains
three different brands of prima-donna, two “ prin-
cipal tenors,” a “character actor,” and a “buffo
singer,” so, if it doesn’t boom, it will do well to be
ashamed of itself.
** * *
Betty Ohls, the little lady who has fol-
lowed Carrie Moore, is a much Merrier Widow
than her predecessor ; and on Saturday night,
after she had finished, the curtain had to go up
three times, and hardened old theatre-goers, who
usually find themselves reaching for their hats on
the conductor’s last down-beat, found themselves
waiting to add a bit of noise to the general
complimentary commotion. Miss Betty hasn t a
big voice, but she uses it very well and very daint-
ily ; and the big Vilia song, which seemed to give
Miss Moore so much pain, was rendered in quite
a different spirit. Of course she attempted no
acting to speak of; in that respect her methods
recalled those of Miss Margaret Thomas, who also
stepped off the concert platform when J.C.W.

“Diana of Dobson’s,” which deserved a
longer run, will cease to teach its great moral
lesson at Sydney Royal on Friday. On Saturday
the Tittell Brune co. starts to play “ The Girl of
the Golden West.” It is for 12 nights only, and
then the company flies to other parts.
Frank and Jen Latona and J. W. Rickaby,
Sydney Tivoli’s latest reinforcements, shed addi-
tional limelight on the second part. Frank has a
genial personality, and makes good music without
effort; but Miss Jen owns the theatre by the
time the turn is fairly started. The smart little
lady has a clear, light soprano voice, a velvet
touch on the piano and a repertoire of clever
songs. J. W. Rickaby is a comedian of the
Nat Clifford type. His methods are very
similar to Clifford’s, but he has plenty of
originality, and possesses a sense of humor —
which item is frequently omitted from the stage
humorist’s make-up. As a drunken policeman
his by-play is excellent, but his best item is a
burlesque of the heroic recitation. Osborn and
Brooks’ new sketch, “The Motorist and the
Maid,” is a dull substitute for the one they dis-
carded. Duncan’s collies, the accomplished dog
actors and musicians, continue to play har-
moniums and act a motor tragedy with great
soulfulness.

Things are lively in the little theatrical
world of Adelaide, where a definite attempt is
being made at last to float a company for building
the long-talked-of second theatre. Various sites
are on offer, a Melbourne manager is ready to
take a lease, and probably business will eventuate.
Meanwhile lessee Pollock, at the Royal, sees to it
that Adelaide gets everything that is going, even
though one week is the usual limit of a local
season for any piece. Just now America runs the
show. (Even the legend of a Dutch “Red Mill ”
is, as to music, plain coon song.) “The Prince of
Pilsen ” had a brief, bright run, with Myles
Clifton Huntleyising, and Loder talking the weird
stuff that is accepted as German-American —the
“Struck Oil” dialect. Neither of the plays is
exactly another “Belle of New York.” Now
more Americans have come in. “The Thief”
suffers from a blend of rather inconsistent
“ motives,” but in the struggle to bowdlerise a
French original, motives are apt to become mixed.
It is a little late to pile any more superlatives on
Kolker and Miss Anglin. Titheradge had a rous-
ing reception. The Town Hall, after a long orgy
of concerts, has gone back to Pictures (Peacock’s).
So has the Pavilion. Leonard Nelson is at the
Tivoli, and the Welsh Singers are all over the
place—even including the Wallaroo mines.

“ 0.K.” writes :
The most interesting woman pianist—not excepting
even Carreno —who has appeared on the Melbourne plat-
form is Miss Katharine Goodson. She plays dashingly,
tenderly, femininely, unaffectedly (as Oarrend did), and
altogether wonderfully. There is more variety in her
style than in that of the other woman ; she has a wide
selection of pieces at her finger tips, she plays everything
from memory with a certain air of let-’em-all-come which
is characteristic of her happy personality, and she
strengthens her grip of her audience as the recital goes
along. A charming artist in all respects, Miss Goodson
has, seemingly, done with Melbourne after making four
appearances and failing to “ draw ” the crowd. Sincerely
musical people came and gave her their best admiration,
but the occasional patrons of concerts ignored these ex-
cellent performances. All the enthusiastic shoutings
of the daily paper critics are powerless, evidently, to
excite Melbourne interest when the city is suffering
a period of musical depression. The public was indif-
ferent to Kubelik (whose top price was a guinea, to
be sure), indifferent to Mark Hambourg, and indifferent
to Katharine Goodson. Melbourne people are not taking
any brilliant soloists just now. Being proverbially fickle,
*the.y will perhaps raise a spasm of interest in the forth-
coming appearance of the local pianiste, Rita Hope, just
back from a three years’ sojourn in Europe. Miss Hope
is also a charming artist of the Leschetizky school,
whose “ send off ” concert filled the Town Hall. Having
done all that was expected of her, and more, her “ revela-
tion ” recital should appeal to public feeling on its
patriotic side, but if the public is altogether unfeeling
in the matter, Rita Hope’s nationality doesn’t count.
She is in the position of being obliged to give a concert—
due on the 16th at the Town Hall —because she is known
to have returned to Melbourne. And though she returned
at a bad time, the young artist has to make the best of it.

The one-night performance of “ Society ”
at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) was a respectable out-
break in its amateur way, as well as a good thing
for the Musical and Dramatic Fund, which gets
the profits of this Savage Club entertainment.
Moreover, it was interesting as a revival of a one-
time very original comedy that has been put into
the shade by stronger works of its type. “Society ”
has a thin love story running on melodramatic
lines through a small meadow of light comedy.
There is no villain in it—only an aggressive young
cad who starts a newspaper, and hopes to get into
Parliament and marry the heroine on the strength
of his bank account, or his doting father’s bank
account. The newspaper turns dog on the
objectionable capitalist, because he didn’t give the
editorship to the friend of the hero, the favored
editor being seemingly powerless to prevent the
disappointed applicant from barking at their em-
ployer in his own rag. Also, the hero wins the
seat in Parliament, and carries off the girl on the
strength of his having succeeded to a baronetcy.
For the rest there are minor characters, sketches,
and bits of Bohemian life. In all respects
save the mounting of the piece the amateurs
did better than their worst friends had expected.
D. M. Beere, who has a fine voice, cool manner
and smart appearance, put force and feeling into
the hero part; Claude Hall was passably amusing
as the battered journalist who revenges himself on
the cad (although he had no idea of impersonating
the character); and F. A. Newman was more or
less admirable as a weary old lord with a talent
for going to sleep. Of the two ladies who had a
lot to do, the rather tall heroine showed more
warmth than her match-making aunt, nevertheless
aunt was a competent relative. In the minor
acting parts N. J. McNally, IS. E. Holroyd and
E. B. Manning topped the score, and in the sing-
ing parts Horace Stevens and Weston Pett did
themselves justice. Both are practised artists.
Pett’s song, “ When Richard the First sat on the
Throne,” is Gilbertian in its humor, and his
enunciation of the words in a crisp tenor voice is
about as telling as could be.

The experiment of staging old English
comedies at Melbourne Royal is unlikely to over-
load the treasury, judging from the fact that
“She Stoops to Conquer” was voted “dead
slow ”on Saturday night. Meynell and Gunn’s
company is a capable combination well worth
seeing in plays that require intelligent “reading”
from the actors ; the scenery, dresses and orches-
tra are equal to the occasion ; but in the present
time and place Oliver Goldsmith’s mild comedy
Strikes one as being not wanted. Looking at it
from the artistic point of view, there is even a
question as to whether it ought to be wanted
in Australia, respectable though it be. “She
Stoops” is about 200 years younger than Shak-
speare’s comedies, but whereas the Bard’s genius
for human characterisation remains as fresh and
striking as ever, and his stories are merely
vehicles for characters, the plays of the 18th cen-
tury dramatists are interesting mainly as pictures
or satires of the manners and customs of sections
of English society at certain periods. In “She
Stoops to Conquer ” you get more of English man-
ners which are out of date than of the mankind
which is always in fashion. The “business” in
places is puerile in its humor. For example, the
second scene in the third act, where Tony
Lumpkin terrifies his mother, is so soft
in its absurdity that a curate might refuse to smile
at it. The Goldsmithian classic, condensed from
five acts into three, has some pretty stuff in it,
but the material at its best is flimsy, and the spots
where the moth of time has damaged the yarn
grow larger and more numerous every ten years
or so. One day the moth will have consumed the
whole piece of antiquity. The very names of
Lumpkin and Hardcastle will pass out of theat-
rical tradition.
Of course, Miss Madge Mclntosh is a
bright, interesting Kate Hardcastle. She hasn’t
quite the air of being natural to the comedy, or of
being the daughter of J. B. Atholwood, whose
Hardcastle is the most convincing item of the
performance. But she certainly shines by com-
parison with Harcourt Beatty, the young Marlow
of her stage affections. Beatty is colorless and
tame. Gaston Mervale plays the second young
man (Hastings) in an easy, casual way. Miss
Maggie Knight makes a capital Mrs. Hardcastle.
Percy Walshe is an exaggerated Diggory, and
Tom Cannam gets very near to a lifelike present-
ment of Tony Lumpkin, which is a feat beyond
the personality of low comedians in general.
JULIUS
KNIGHT
in “ The Scarlet
Pimpernel.”
The Cuptimely-production at the house of
Anderson, in Melbourne, is “The Midnight
Mail,” a melodrama populated by railway em-
ployees, policemen, and a mixed gathering. It has
the distinction of being one of the few amazing
dramas wherein Bert Bailey is a seriously bad
character. At the desire of an alleged Turkish
adventurer (who is really Laurence Dunbar),
Bailey 'undertakes to wreck a train for £5O oh
account, to which end he drugs the signalman,
and stiffens the danger signal, and is only saved
from a murderous crime by the splendid heroism
of an opportune engine-driver, who waves a lamp
in the face of the advancing engine. The engine
has a squib in its funnel, and looks like a large
Christmas toy, but its results would be shocking—
the drama says—if it didn’t pull up with solemn
funereal suddenness when the lamp meets its eye.
Geo. Cross is the engine-driver out of work by
whom the awful catastrophe is averted, and
Bailey is the dismissed stoker responsible for the
trouble. Beer brought him under the baneful
influence of the terrible Turk. His thirst is a
feature of the piece, and in his degraded state he
appears to great advantage as a mezzo-tragedian.
Miss Duggan suffers much sorrow and incon-
venience as the wife of Cross the engine-driver,
Miss Guildford moves in the uppah circles, and
15 other people help to thwart the plans of the
red-faced miscreant from Constantinople.
** * *
“The Scarlet Pimpernel,” on being
brought to pass at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne)
last Saturday, proved to be an illegitimate
example of romantic costume-drama. It presents
a hero whose tigerish nonchalance gives him the
aspects of a drugged prig, and a heroine who drags
the aged corpse of a marital estrangement through
four acts. It is wholesome but quite uninspiring
stodge, with festoons of ample decorative attire
to make it picturesque. The hero, Sir Percy
Blakeney, has so much time on his hands that he
must be for ever rescuing French aristocrats from
the guillotine. In that intemperate pastime he is
assisted by a mob of young bloods who have pillaged
the English language of most of its picturesque
ejaculations, and have furthermore become irre-
parably perky over the dangers of their career.
They arouse the suspicions of the French Govern-
ment, whereupon there flits into the narrative a
French spy, one Chauvelin, in a greasy wig and
funereal costume. Chauvelin, whose mission is to
find out who the Pimpernel is, makes his profession
apparent at the start by his air of moody omnipo-
tence and the suggestion that he is buried in reti-
cence. Yet he appears to arouse no distrust. That
is only one small unconvincing feature in a play
that is conspicuously unconvincing throughout.
In truth, it is swamped with theatrical effects,
and, moreover, gets no powerful assistance from
the company, whose eminence seems to have
staled with age. Julius Knight, as Sir Percy
Blakeney, has the ease of long practice,
but he never removes the impression that
the affected airiness and negligence of a
rather wearying bore are slightly overdone.
If Julius in his titanic garb is not a great cause
for gratification. Miss Ola Humphrey, as Lady
Blakeney, is no greater. Although an improved
actress, she retains a good deal of her previous
artificiality, nor does she succeed in thoroughly
nailing the attention even with a molten wig and
preposterous millinery. In scenes calling for fire,
passion and protestation—as in Act 111., particu-
larly—Miss Humphrey touches no chord in one’s
innermost soul. The part of Chauvelin falls to
Leslie Victor, who saves it from barrenness
by some consciousness of its novver. Herbert
J. Bentley and Reynolds Denniston play
the parts of Lord Dewhurst and Sir Andrew
Ffoulks respectively, while Harry Plimmer’s pic-
ture of the Prince of Wales is characterless, but
very soothing. As the Comtesse de Tournai
(played in Sydney by Miss Susie Vaughan, some
months back), Miss Elsie Wilson is distinguished
enough to overawe Lady Blakeney easily, when
the pair meet in the first act. An exaggerated
accent, however, is not in her favor. As for Miss
Elwyn Harvey, she makes of the innocent and
ingenuous Suzanne de Tournai a wide-eyed and
wondering damsel of dangerously bathetic inclina-
tions.
** * *
At Melbourne Princess’s, ‘ ‘ The Prince of
Pilsen”is the usual comic opera big gun who
travels incognito, wrapped in rumor and dignity,
while the cheerful bounder chips in earlier, also
incognito, and collects the fat. Surrounding
them are the necessary adventurous widow with a
keen eye for the main chance—incognito or other-
wise—the youthful lovers who are necessary for the
sentimental duets, and also the soubrette and the
valet, without whom any respectable opera would
lose caste —as well as its main chances of song and
dance. The initial flare of “ Pilsen ” gives delusive
hopes of brightness to come. The chorus is splen-
did, and, at first, the “turns” hustle each other
with a brilliant rush. Then, for no reason at all, the
artists get tired ; one by one they drift off into a
hotel and leave the unfortunate audience alone
for a ghastly long time with a hopelessly drunk
Cincinnati brewer who talks piffle to the widow.
Instead of going off in disgust, this widow (dressed
in a low-cut gown most unsuitable for morning
wear) walks coyly about the court and encourages
the beer-drunk. Just as the audience gropes dis-
gustedly for its hat, all the singing and dancing
stars rush back on the stage and get at it again,
and just then the curtain falls and all is over.
Fortunately, the majority of the players
are quite interesting. “ Prince ” Sherras is a fine
beauty man. Clifton is an inimitable artist,
as well as a passable Voice and an excellent dancer
—he makes much of an almost invisible part as a
Huntley-like type of English earl. There is
soubrette Fanny Dango with her dainty dancing,
and her feet play marvellously into the hands of
clever Fred Leslie. Fanny Dango puts brains
into her feet, so to speak, and dances with her
head, in a manner of putting it. Ford, with his
eccentric hoof-leaping, is far too little seen, and
little Alma Barber produces a top note that shows
real promise. Maorilander Amy Murphy, who
has worn off some of her stage-fright and stiffness,
warbles with the ease of a thrush, and young
Hogue holds his own well. Loder,-as the Cincin-
nati brewer, would be tolerated if he had only got
that evening train home and not slept a drunken
sleep on the billiard table all night. He was so
drunk in the morning. For the rest, there is the
played-out pantomimic insertion of a parade of
“States and Countries” —the limelight ladies
who step-dance and wear wool if they’re N.S. W.
and wheat if they represent Victoria, and so on in
done-to-death sequence.

The allegation that “ The Woman Pays ”
is being advanced at Melbourne Bijou, in four acts
and many scenes. As a rule, the woman doesn’t
pay if she can find a man to accept the liability,
but in this case she does. And having parted with
what is more precious than gold and silver and
jewels and so forth, she naturally screams for
revenge. Through her incriminating evidence
the villain she overpaid is eventually hanged for
killing a postman. In this act of revenge she is as-
sisted by a hotel potman, who saw the murder whilst
roosting on the bough of a spreading chestnut tree,
and took a snapshot of the crime. The villain
denies his guilt, but his negative is put to con-
fusion by the negative of the apparatus that cannot
lie. This shows the folly of slaying a postman in
the shade of a tree where a potman builds his
nest. Edwin Geach’s company is presenting
“The Woman Pays” to the admirers of bellow-
drama, many of whom were conspicuously absent
last Saturday night. Melbourne has got into the
way of assuming that the mirrored 'walls of the
Bijou reflect emptiness and desolation, therefore
these remarks are intended to notify absentees of
the thrilling spectacle in store for them.

Wirth’s Circus, at Wirth’s Park (other-
wise the Court of the deposed Prince), is just now
in the throes of Cup week. For the moment, the
educated horse has supplanted his rival noble
animals in the multitude’s esteem, and the daring
equestrian who mounts his steed at one fell swoop
is the supreme hero of the arena. Next week the
two Gladiators, the three Gamons, the Bros.
Rodriguez, and other variety artists will divide
the honors equally with John Welby Cook, but
in the meantime the trade mark of the circus is a
gee-gee rampant, and the elephants seetn conscious
of the fact that their trunks have been put out of
joint.

The most popular of West’s Picture
“turns” at the Olympia is a sensational drama—
“ The Redman and the Child ” —which receives
an irresistible encore, especially on Saturday
nights. All the other pictures on the programme
are subject to a weekly change, but “The Red-
man and the Child ” has been retained by General
Desire. It is an admirable drama, and the actors
are modest, assuming o-fists, who give no
trouble to the managem. . , and don’t want any
salary.

Burt Shepard, whose proceedings have
the value of all harmless sedatives, is trying to
keep the present writer away from Melbourne
Opera House, with doubtful success. Still, Burt
is to depart shortly with his wad of patriarchal
yarns, and, meantime, Hodgson and Lowther are
amusingßickards’patrons more or less with a queer
sketch, in which a couple of fictitious monkeys
and some other curious things disport themselves.
Also the Barnard Family has arrived—anyhow,
it was due on Cup night—with its troupe of

AT POVERTY POINT.
Meynell and Gunn have given Sydneyite Lizette Parkes
the show she deserves. She is to play Julia in “The
Belle of Mayfair” in Adelaide, now that Gracie Sinclaire,
who was imported especially to be stage-loved by Roland
Bottomley, has left for England. Lizette is, in her own
line, about the smartest home product of her age and
sex now on the local stage.
The name of Albert Norman, who used to eject the
mirthless “Ha! Ha!” of bad intention in the service of'
Blandolt, cropped up in a County Court case in Melbourne
one day recently. Apparently, Albert has thrown up his
old tremendous profession, and, with his wife, entered
upon the long beer industry. Yet, in the case of Albert
and his missus, it hasn’t been especially felicitous. It
seems that they came into possession of a pub at
Epping (Vic.) on the information of a gentleman who,
they allege, told them that the takings were greater than
they really were ; and there has been sad trouble in conse-
quence. And for this Albert relinquished a profession in
which he almost invariably had money to burn at the
altar of Delilah, and was magnificently haughty even
when he went away to get hanged in the last act.
Petersburg (S.A.) gives a prize for the largest family at

“Melb.”: Where’s the entry of the Khaki Guards into
London in “Human Nature”? This was Gus Harris’s
greatest achievement. A corner of the Trafalgar Square
Monument base was picked, with one of the lions heaped
over with spectators. None could tell where the real
spectators ended and the painted ones began. Then the
troops came round. This was just after the fall of Khar-
toum. Of course, the army could keep on coming round
all night. Ellen Terry narrates this kind of dodge in the
introduction of a march of French troops when Claude
Melnotte goes to the wars. The drop curtain at the
Lyceum went up as often as the public wanted.
Same thing in “ Henry V.” and Robertson’s “ Ours.”
Also on the kid’s toy, where you wind the soldiers round

“JeanSibi”: What a cruelly affecting play is “Zira”!
Boiled down, it is the old argument between awful re-
spectability and the equally awful heavenliness acquired
at the expense of one big, rosy sin. You get it in full in
the third act, when the real and spurious Ziras have it
out and leave you surfeited with their differing and not
particularly novel ideas of morality. The scene needs a
cruder and more melodramatic actress than Miss Anglin
is. It further demands a larger perception of the outrage
put upon the real Zira than Miss Vaughan ever shows.
Thus, the scene is ill-balanced, Miss Anglin getting so
much of the “ fat ” that she appears more wronged than
wronging. It is easy to see that the play was shaped by
propagandists. If they were observers before they were
political or social agitators they would not have spent
their strength on creating Zira and the parson, and left
the Bacchanalian young man and the ludicrous bishop
such unimportant and facetious features. The young
gentleman has been dug up from some old, dead stock,
while the bishop is a more than usually fatuous mon-
strosity. When the young clergyman informs him of his
(the clergyman’s) rescue work in the East End, the old boy
is so profoundly disturbed that he says, “ This is
blasphemy ! ” A little later on, when the parson is recit-
ing further particulars, he says, “ Thisis rank Socialism! ”
One does not know whether his foolishness or his pom-
posity is the more wearisome.
“ Trix” : Howard Carr, J.O.W.’s giant conductor—the
youth elevates about 76in. of himself before the “Merry
Widow ” co—is blossoming forth as a composer of ambi-
tious music. Just now three of his efforts threaten the
public. Mr. Slap plays his “Cosmos” ballet presently ;
and Melbourne is to hear a flashing overture, which is so
extraordinarily difficult that the London Symphony
Orchestra has made a show piece of it. The Sydney
Symphony Society presents another of his works this
month, and the author will conduct. It is called “ The
Black Opal,” and was inspired and written here.
“Lime”: The frost that his show met with in Mel-
bourne chilled Herbert Flemming’s heart and hastened
his end. After the success of “ The Morals of Marcus ’ r
in Sydney, he relied upon that play to win back in Mel-
bourne the thousands of pounds he had lost since his
late season at the Sydney Criterion. Only a success in
Melbourne would have enabled him to continue the long
tour he had booked, and to produce the new' plays in the
“ script ” box. He was quite confident of recovering his
losses. “ Marcus ” opened badly, however, at the
Princess’s, and went from ill to worse. On Wednesday,
Flemming called his people together and told them that
he could not go on ; on the following Friday morning he
was dead. Flemming the actor will be missed by play-
goers ; Flemming the manager in a far greater degree by
the men and women who w’orked for him, and knew his
kindness of heart and unfailing gentleness. The “old
guv’nor” was esteemed the straightest and whitest
manager working in this hemisphere.
There has been a considerable shuffling of the cards in
theatrical circles during the last few’ days. The death of
the late lamented Herbert Flemming broke up the co. he
had organised. Margaret Anglin has to be in colder
climes than these by the beginning of 1909 to fulfil long-
booked engagements. Ola Jane Humphrey and Julius
Knight have not been such a deliriously happy family
that thev aren’t prepared to drift apart for a space.
Hence the following results. Beatrice Day will lead with
Julius in place of the fair Ola, as soon as the term of the
latter’s engagement is up. Margeret Anglin will flee to
America about the same time. She will leave her com-
pany behind, and O. J. Humphrey will join it in her place,
after which it will be known as the Humphre.v-Titheradge-
Kolker co. The new combination will play “The Thief,”
“Zira,” “ Twelfth Night ” and “ The Silver King,” start-
ingin M.L. and working through the rain and dearth of
public-houses to Sydney.
Elinor Glyn, author of the notorious “Three Weeks,”
seems to have plenty of nerve. She has made a drama
out of the story, and when the Licenser refused to pass
it, she gave a big and fashionably-attended “private”
performance at London Adelphi so as to copyright it
before it goes on to America. Also she played her own
heroine, and gave color to the part by wearing a dress
that—well, one of the critics remarks guardedly that it
would be “ useful for mothers.”
A PIOUS ASPIRATION.

One grieves to think, my Vickery,
How it must give you pain
If you can see your property,
And hearken to the vain,
Unrighteous ditties howled there by
The gramaphone amain.
How do you face the Methodist.
Whose seat’s near yours Above,
As tinned folk tell how they were kissed,
And yell of carnal love
Where hymns should soar? You blush, I wist.
Hotter than any stove.
Damnation and the dance we know
March in a common train ;
Do you not writhe as from below
Bill Murray’s strident strain
Is heard entreating one (Ah woe !)
To “ waltz him round again.”
Nor is the stave that Miller sings
More seemly—nay, for he
A coarse and horrid slang word brings
Where it should never be,
As up through space his loud voice wings
In “You can’t diddle me.”
Tickling’s a pastime that the saint
Even on bad old earth
Regards with loathing, yet its taint
Pervades your hall, where worth
Should reign. I ween you well-nigh faint
Harking to Lauder’s mirth.
Ah ! let us pray, my Vickery,
For the repose of mind
Of the regenerate, that ye
In your new home may find
The saints, re happ’nings here, to be
Not only deaf, but blind.

A CONSIGNMENT FOR RICKARDS’.
On board the same vessel which brought Jack Johnson
to Adelaide were the Governor-General and Bishop
Harmer.— News Item.
LITLLE BOY : “O, I say, wait a jiff.” (Aside)
“ What luck I brought my camera!”
After all, the young Australian can be a
most obliging kiddy. Just so that the doctors
who had been at the Medical Congress might
keep their hand in, a boy was born on the train
in which they were returning to Adelaide. Un-
fortunately there wasn’t a nurse on board; but
there were enough M.D.’s to give a hand of wel-
come to twenty young Australians.
Since engine-drivers Milburn and Dolman
have been found not responsible for the Sunshine
(Vic.) railway horror, the Law has decided that
it isn’t worth while to try Stationmaster Kendall
at all. His case has been dropped, and there,
apparently, the matter ends. It is a habit of the
Law to try the nearest man, and when he proves
to be the wrong man, to drop the case instead of
doing a hustle round to see if it can’t find the right
person. The Law’s attitude is that it always
arrests the right man in the first place, and if he
isn’t convicted, it is simply a shocking miscarriage
of justice. Therefore, there is nothing more for
the Law to do save regret the shocking miscar-
riage, and have a beer, and go home. It is an easy
arrangement for the Law, but the public has its
doubts. In the present case, as in every other
case, somebody is responsible. If Milburn, Dol-
man, and Kendall are not, then, there being no
other definite individual in' sight, the lia-
bility rests on the decayed rolling-stock, for
which somebody is responsible, or on the
decayed system generally, and for that also
someone is responsible. To the lay mind,
some probable causes of danger on the Vic.
lines seem to be (1) a deficient staff ; (2) hideously
overworked stationmasters and others, who must
neglect something because it is impossible to do
everything; (3) delayed trains, the delay being
caused in some cases by the muddlement or
economy which prefers one enormously long train
to two ordinary-sized ones, and by the fact that
when a very long train arrives at a very short
platform it has to make two stops —one for the
front carriages and one for the rear ones—and
consequently is losing time all the while ; (4) a
habit of taking risks with distant signals, said
habit having arisen out of the fact that trains are
late through making extra stoppages and through
delays at stations where one man is doing the
work of three, and lost time has to be made up, if
possible, somehow ; and (5) antiquated brakes.
Behind every one of these things there is some
responsible person, and that person should be
looked for. Behind all the small responsi-
ble persons there must be the big, supremely-
responsible person, and he should be
looked for. The simple method of seizing the
nearest person, trying him, and dropping the
whole case when he is acquitted is a very good
way of diverting attention, but it isn’t satis-
factory. If a line is left unfenced, and a train is
wrecked by a collision with a cow, the handiest
method is for the authorities who left the line
unfenced to hurriedly take up the r6le of prose-
cutors and proceed against (1) the engine-driver,
(2) the cow ; and let the matter slide when they
fail to get convictions against these two. That is
what may be called following the line of least
resistance, but the line of least resistance is badly
ballasted and quite unfit for high-speed travelling.

As seen in photographs, the wreckage of
Zeppelin’s airship looks like a collapsed bridge,
or the skeleton of a sea-serpent that died after
swallowing three tons of prussic acid. The dreary
mass of twisted metal is in itself a good argument
for the heavier-than-air machine, for Zeppelin’s
contrivance—though it was almost as big as an
ocean liner —could only carry a few people. The
machine that will take in a load of tired clerks at
King-street, Sydney, rise with a whir of pro-
pellers, and fly like a benevolent crow straight for
Darlinghurst will not want to be much larger
than an ordinary tram. A crowded suburb like
Darlinghurst hasn’t space for anything as large as
a ship, and if flying-machines alight on roofs and
do damage, there’ll be the landlord as well as the
Devil to pay. And the injured landlord wants a
lot more than the Devil any day.

“The land in question is worth from
£lOO,OOO to £200,000,” one lawyer remarked in a
Vic. court the other day. “It will be worth less
"’hen counsel have done with it.” murmured 0.-J.
Madden. “The land in question” is the block
whereon stands Queen’s Walk, at
the corner of Collins and Swanston
streets, Melbourne. It was be-
queathed by the late Thomas Black
to sundry beneficiaries, but wasn’t
to be sold for less than £BOO per
font. It has been put up for auc-
tion, but it won’t reach near that
figure, and apparently the bene-
ficiaries have wearied of waiting,
and want the Law to vary tbe
conditions of the old man’s will so
that they can finger the yellow coin.
Therefore they have briefed no less
than 10 expensive sharks, and Costs is feeling
good and is in better fighting trim than either
Burns or Johnson.
A MAXIM FOR CUP WEEK .
Consider the horses of the field, they toil not, neither do they spin—unless lacked by the owners.
Solemn Lee, N.S.W. Minister for Works,
has gone to the assistance of the Sydney adver-
tising fiend, and has nullified the good intentions
of those suburban councils which attempted to
settle the glaring advt. business by taxing the
hoardings out of existence. Lee has published a
new Local Government ordinance, giving to all
existing hoardings something like security of
tenure. Legal proof has to be adduced that any
hoarding is either objectionable or unsightly
before it can be touched, and the bill-posting pro-
fession can easily produce witnesses to testify to
the beauty and the chaste, artistic effect of any
hoarding, and the delight they experience in
gazing thereon. Further, all existing contracts
can only be taxed up to Id. per square yard, while
some of the councils were prepared to smite them
to the extent of ss. a foot. New hoardings are appar-
ently beyond Solemn Lee’s protecting arm ; but
in view of the thousands of eyesores already
disfiguring the landscape, there is poor satis-
faction in that. The remedies that will proba-
bly be applied in the end are a vigilance committee
and a long chain and a forest devil. The forest
devil is a thing that tears up trees by the roots ;
in fact, if the chain is strong enough, and the
lever long enough, one man can tear up a cathe-
dra] with it. Working at dead of night with a
quarter-mile of rope, the operator could be hidden
in a house quite a distance away, and when the
pill advt. tottered and fell he could haul in his
line and go to bed with a clear conscience. The
Bulletin knows where a forest devil can be
bought cheap.

Just now an application is being made for
a publican’s license at Port Kembla (N.S.W.),
where there are electrolytic and smelting works,
and 400 or 500 more or less thirsty toilers.
It seems, at present, to be a toss-up whether
the license will be granted or not, as the non-
drinkers are fighting hard to deprive the dry
man of his beer. His only chance now is to
tramp to Wollongong, five miles away, and
run the risk of being swallowed by quick-
sands on the return journey, leaving a help-
lass widow and a lot of orphans to be cared
for by an overburdened State. Whether is
it better that a man should die a lingering
death of thirst at home, and leave something
to his widow, or be smothered suddenly in
the Tom Thumb quicksand and leave nothing,
is a large question. It is estimated that
there will be a population of 10,000 at “ The
Port ”in five years’ time. The pub, many
people say, will be “a gold mine.”

“ Bloggs ” writes : •
Permit me to join issue with “Billy,” who writes (B.
22/10/’08) objecting to the frequent use by our papers of
the expression “ the finest in the Southern Hemisphere.”
In my view if there is any potted newspaper phrase whose
frequent employment is more or less excusable, it is the
one “ Billy ” carps at. Australia has out and away the
best climate in the Southern Hemisphere. That is
admitted by the most carping of Stinking Fishites. Its
big cities are not so considerable, numerically, as Buenos
Aires or Rio, but (1) they are cleaner and healthier, (2)
they are white. Rio, Capetown, Buenos Aires, Santiago,
Valparaiso are all picturesque and impressive conglomera-
tions of human beings, but the humans that teem in them
include black, brown, grey, and half-a-dozen other shades.
Deliberately I say it, there is no city in the Southern
Hemisphere to touch either Sydney or Melbourne from
the Caucasian’s standpoint. “ Billy ” discourses on the
subject of trains in S’Africa, and the superior feeding,
bathing and other arrangements they possess in com-
parison with Australian trains. To start with, the only
S’African train that boasts the luxuries “ Billy” mentions
is the transcontinental express ; and it is one of the most
expensive to travel by in the world. The ordinary
S’African train has a cosmopolitan reputation for vileness,
insanitariness and discomfort. The trail of the insuffici-
ently washed and near-to-Nature savage is over it from
engine to dog-box. I have travelled on a good many rail-
way S3 r stems in m3’ time —across America, through most
of England and Scotland, and over a good deal of Italy,
France, Germanyand Switzerland —and I say with a clear
conscience that, taken b3’ and large, the Australian State
railways are the best I know. There is a good deal to be
said for the local custom of getting off the train at meal
times and feeding ashore, so to speak. Who that has
tried it does not recall the awful “train-taste” of the
most skilfully-cooked dishes which have been prepared
aboard during a railway journey. Even on the famous
Mediterranean train de luxe, which makes a specialt3' of
high-class cooking, I have had deplorable meals, with
entrees flavored seemingly with axle-grease, and sweets
defiled with grit from the adjacent engine. Nor is there
anvthing in the alleged “luxury ” of a bath aboard a
moving train. It is the dirtiest, most uncomfortable
bath known to humanity. Far pleasanter is the Aus-
tralian arrangement, whereby the long-distance traveller
gets an hour or so off at each big centre for tubbing pur-
poses. In one respect only will I 3’ield to “ Billy.” He is
right as to the comparative evilness of our hotels. None
of them is in the same class with the Waikiki Beach at
Honolulu, the Galle Face at Colombo (though these aren’t
in the Southern Hemisphere), or a dozen others that
might be mentioned. But then hotel tariffs in Aus-
tralia are (again speaking in a comparative sense)
ridiculously low.
The N.S.W. Full Court woke up with a
start last week and heaved some called-for and
acid rebukes at Section 19 of Wade’s Liquor
(Amendment) Act. This section provides that if
people gamble in hotel apartments between 11
p.m. and 6 a.m. the licensee is liable to a stiff fine.
The licensee may not have known ; it is very
difficult, in a large hotel, for a landlord to know
whether two or three boarders are assembled in a
bedroom or not, and if they are assembled it is
equally hard to be sure what they are doing, especi-
ally if they have stuffed a bit of paper in the key-
hole. Yet if the Law stumbles on to the gamblers’
trail, the landlord is held by Wade’s Act to be as
guilty as any of them. The Act is the more
anomalous in this regard since, by its provisions,
the licensee who is able to state that he “ knew
nothing of what was going on” is immune
from punishment in regard to any gambling
that occurs in his establishment between
6 a.m. and 11 p.m. So the pub-keeper
who wants to keep absolutely safe from un-
pleasantness under Wade’s Act needs to revo-
lutionise his sleeping habits. He may slumber
without risk during the day time happy in the
knowledge that, if J. Wren himself arrives Tote
in hand and starts operations in the front draw-
ing-room, there will be no trouble so long as he
(the landlord) is able to show he was asleep, and
hence was ignorant of Wren’s movements. But
all night from 11 p.m. onwards and during the
first half-dozen hours of the morning he must, if
he would side-step monetary loss and danger to
his license, transform himself into a human
sleuth tracking gamblers unceasingly about the
brewery’s corridors.

Some horribly cantankerous ghost seems
to have charge of things under Roma, in Western
Queensland. First of all, while the township was
putting down a bore to tap the artesian basin in
order to get a drink, the cantankerous ghost
turned on a supply of gas instead. The gas
wasn’t expected to last many days, so nothing
was done with it until it had run to waste for
seven years ; then the aldermen reckoned that it
looked permanent, and decided to harness it for
lighting purposes. The plant to do so cost £7OOO.
Directly the gasometer was put up, the cantank-
erous ghost chuckled—all ghosts chuckle—and
suddenly turned the supply off at the meter
underground. Roma decided then that it would
get its long-delayed water at last; and promptly
upon boring being resumed oil appeared on
the surface of the water. The sign of the oil
aroused a new brand of enterprise, and the
usual syndicate induced the Government to
put up a trifle to help to exploit the
place for oil. So the syndicate bored away, and
was getting along nicely, when the drill got
into the gas strata, and the cantankerous ghost
promptly blew the gas into the boiler-fire. Roma
had never seen such a blaze as danced over the
hole. Still, the bigger the blaze, the higher the
syndicate’s hopes that the supply of oil underneath
will be enough to give quite a new industry to
Australia ; and already every other man in Roma
reckons that he will be up beside Rockefeller in a
year or two.
“ Sr” from Melbourne :
The blokes who fly round with the tons of stones at-
tached to a single wire, on Melbourne’s two big building
jobs, the new station and the Town Hall, are marvels to
me. Up in the air, to the height of 100 ft., they direct
their flight with a whistle, relying on the winchman’s
sharpness to answer the signal, and work away for a
laborer’s wage. They seem quite content, yet the slight-
est mistake means that, in about two seconds, a falling'
body would rebound off the golden gate, and St. Peter
would hear the thud. Most of these professional “stone
directors” are sailors, and their daring, skill and agility
are the wonder of the street crowd. Yet their pay is
only the splendid remuneration of an unskilled laborer.
I’d sooner play golf any day than do great leaps on the
end of a long wire with a heavy rock and a thing to toot
toot upon.

The wild man of Oarcoar (N.S.W.) recalls
the capture of the wild man of Nunawading by the
Vic. poliS®, about 15 years back. He was also big
and hairy, but he was deficient in physique, and, in
place of talking freely of his achievements and his
ambitions in life, he replied to all questions by a
succession of gutturals which nobody in Nuna-
wading could recognise. He was taken to Mel-
bourne, and in the city watchhouse held
a levee of all the leading foreigners in
the place. There were more consuls in
attendance than there are at a Governor’s
levee, but one and all retired discomfited.
Eighteen definite theories were advanced. Uni-
'“rsity professors discoursed learnedly, and tried
to show how certain sounds he uttered had their
origin in Sanskrit roots, and an imaginative re-
porter on the old Melbourne Standard came out
with a column-long theory proving indisputably
that he was another Buckley who had wandered
away from the stronghold of an undiscovered
aboriginal tribe in a remote valley of Upper Gipps-
land. The linguist of the detective force inter-
viewed the prisoner—who had been charged
with insulting behavior because he couldn’t
sp. ik English—and, after listening attentively,
pronounced the chat a form of low Slavonic peculiar
to the Caucasus Mountains. Just as he was
giving his reasons with scientific precision,
Tom Waldron, known in later years as the
strongest man in the force, strolled in and was
told that the central figure of the hour was in the
cell. “ Arrah,” remarked Waldron, who hailed
from Connemara, “an’ perhaps it’s a counthry-
mahn av moine he is.” Walking up to the wicket,
he hollered through it: “ Thirrum go Balen.”
There was a scamper across the floor of the cell, a
long thin hand was thrust through the wicket,
and the wild man yelled delightedly : “Thirrum
go Bragh ! ” It proved that he had once known
English, but when some form of lunacy came upon
him and he ran wild and grew much hair, the
Sassenach speech had deserted him, and he could
talk nothing but old plain Kerry.
“Megalomaniacs” is now the favorite
term of two or three Tory papers for the ad-
vocates of a handsome and stately Australian
capital beside a big clean river, in preference to a
small one with no river alongside it. The term is
singularly inappropriate. The megalomaniac is a
person with extravagant, costly, and overwhelm-
ing ideas. The advocates of a capital at Dalgety
don’t propose to build any more, or any larger, or
any more costly Parliament Houses or Govern-
ment offices or Governor’s residences than would
be necessary at Canberra. They only propose to
plant the city where it may have a chance to build
itself in a natural way, and advance the argu-
ments: (1) That it is very foolish not to
plant the new city beside a fine river,
when there is one available ; (2) that as
Australia will be almost the biggest area
on earth which is governed directly from one city
it wouldn’t be surprising if that city, provided it
is situated where there is a good climate, fertile
soil, and abundance of water power for cheap
manufacturing purposes, becomes a place of size.
Melbourne was laid out by an intelligent megalo-
maniac who reckoned that the hamlet of Beargrass
might be a city some day, and he made provision
accordingly. Sydney was laid out by somebody

“ I know , dearest, but I didn't think you could

who took a small size in the hat he wore on the
bump of prophecy. He was a melancholiac who
said there was no hope, so he supplied streets
suited for a village, and Sydney must expend
many millions of money—it has already expended
a lot of money—in repairing his work. Later on
N.S.W. went in for megalomania right enough,
but its craze was big loans instead of wide streets.
An intelligent megalomaniac, who doesn’t spend
money but merely has hopes and provides for the
future, is a very good thing for any country to
have on the premises.
IN THE BAG!
PUNTER (seeking information): “Are you afraid of anything in the field, Billy?"
JOCKEY: “Only the stewards!”
Hitherto Maoriland has been quite satis-
fied that it was the introduction of the white
man’s clothing that accounted for the decline of
the Maori race. The argument was that the
Maori in the old days oiled his body and stayed
indoors when it rained. But having acquired
clothing, he went out in the rain, got wet, and
allowing his clothes to dry on him, faded away as
the result of chills, pneumonia and other pul-
monary complaints. Appar-
ently it was all a fairy tale.
The extra mortality is not
among the adults, but among
the babies. Before the white
man came along the babies
got their natural food and
throve accordingly. But the
pakeha brought his feeding
bottle with him, and the re-
sult was deadly. The killing
power of the bottle was
much increased when tinned
milk came along, for the
brown baby who had sur-
vived the dirty bottle usually
crumpled right up before
the condensed milk; and
the very hardiest brown
baby, who had survived both
bottle and condensed milk,
met the coup de grdce when
the Maori mother, in the
absence of milk, mixed flour
and hot water in the bottle.
That was the final com-
bination, and when it be-
came general the poor little
brown baby just cried itself
to its last sleep, and found
Death a kind, relieving
friend. The recent move-
ment among educated young
Maoris to teach sanitary
science to their people has
brought this hideous waste
of child life to view, and, in
the interests of the brown
baby, nurses are being sent
to the native villages to
instruct mothers in the
practical feeding of infants.
So it is just possible that
the Maori may not disappear
after all.
A Sydney coal-lumper named Davies
probably had the closest call of anybody in Aus-
tralia last week. He was working on top of a
coal-bunker, on the steamer Ayrshire, when the
coal started to slip away, and Davies slipped with
it for 30ft. towards the bottom of the bunker—the
coal was on a slope. All that was showing of him
was his head and an arm. There was soon a crowd
of men at work to dig him out; but as they dug
the coal on top slipped, and an extra slip would
have been the end of Davies. It seemed a hope-
less job—the more they dug the further Davies
slipped down into the bunker. Finally, after an
hour and a half, he had got to the bottom ; and it
was his luck that he landed right on top of a trap-
door. As they couldn’t pull him out by the roots,
so to speak, they gingerly opened the trap-door,
and pulled him through feet first. It was a limp
lumper that they put into the ambulance to take
to the hospital; yet, when they overhauled him
there, all they found wrong with himyvas a bruise
or so.
A recent meeting of the Australian His-
torical Society dredged up afew scraps of early Syd-
ney from the drift of half a century or so. Fifty
years ago, the block at the corner of King and
George streets, now occupied by the E. S. and A.
Bank, was the site of a butcher’s shop ; and the
Blackboy Inn filled ’em up again
cheerily where the A.J.S. Bank now
stands. Belfield’s hotel, on the oppo-
site corner, was then an ironmonger’s
shop. The other corner, valued in 1823
at £63, was bought by W. H. Moore,
later by bookseller Cole, and still later
by W. 'T. Waters. About six years
ago, Sydney Council resumed 5J square
feet of this land for £lsoo—at the
rate of £720,000 for the block bought
in 1823 for £63. In the ’fifties, a
journey across the harbor to North
Shore or Balmain cost the adventurous
voyager 6d., and to Mosman cost
him 45., by pulling boat. The block
bounded by King, Castlereagh, Hunter
and Pitt streets contained many his-
torical buildings, including the first
church in Australia, erected in 1793,
the site of which it is now proposed
to mark by a monument of some sort.
There were then three avenues for
pedestrians through the block, but
no carriage-way existed between
King and Hunter streets. Moore-street
(Foxlow-place) came later. The old
Prince of Wales Theatre and others erected on
the site of the present Theatre Royal were burnt
down three times. The big fire of ’6O wiped out a
lot of old landmarks ; also it wiped out a lot of old
insanitary rookeries.

The luck of ships isn’t often of the lucra-
tive kind described in a recent Bulletin par.
concerning the Noorebar. Last July the Union
S.S. Co.’s coal carrier, Hawea, broke down in the
Tasman Sea and drifted for weeks. The Union
Co. spent about £6OOO looking for it. Its skipper
lost his job over a difference of opinion of some
sort with his owners, and the vessel, with a
mended tail, started on a fresh stagger over to
Maoriland with a new skipper. Last week the
Hawea piled its bones on Greymouth breakwater,
and when last heard of the owner’s £6OOO had
every appearance of being absolutely wasted.
What a falling off was there when N.S. W.
Supreme Court opened its fourth term the other
day ! Only three Justices in scarlet gowns and
full-bottomed wigs, only two King’s Counsel, and
only two ladies were present. A few years ago
four or five Justices at least spread themselves on
the Bench, while counsel and solicitors fought for
seats anywhere, and ladies, resplendent in the
newest fashions, filled the jury-box and every
other available vacant space. “ I don’t know,”
said a Justice now on the pension list, when
ladies’ attendance first began to flag—“l don’t
know why the Court is losing its attractiveness.”
And he looked at his scarlet and felt his wig. “It
must be that the Crown is not so particular as it
used to be in the style of man it puts on the
Bench.” Then he looked at himself generally.
THE CONSUMPTION OF COMBUSTIBLES.
SHE: “Do you use much fuel on a trip?”
HE : “ Yes. About a quart of petrol and a

The Melbourne unemployed have at least
a sense of humor. A deputation lately asked the
Stock Exchange, of all bodies, to assist them to
get work ; and while the leaders were putting
their case, another part of the deputation took a
well-known broker aside and assured him, from a
purely impersonal and political point of view,
that he “belonged to a body of parasites that
battened on labor.” It wasn’t exactly a compli-
ment, and the broker is a lusty and hasty man ;
but apparently the inherent truth of the observa-
tion staggered him. Anyway, he didn’t attempt
a retort or even an excuse.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
N.S.W. Equity Court on Monday took the
troubles of the City Bank of Sydney, the Farmers and
Settlers’ Co-op. Society Ltd. (in liquidation), and William
McMillan another stage. The Farmers and Settlers, which
was chiefly McArthur and Co. and W. McMillan, accepted
a large quantity of farmers’wheat for sale and storage.
The co. pledged about 36,000 bags of wheat for about
£46,000, and then exploded. Two questions arose—(l)
Did the wheat on delivery become the property of the
co. ? (2) Under the Factors Act, could the co. pawn it ?
The Chief Judge in Equity held with regard to the first
question that the co. never held the wheat except merely
as agent; the wheat remained the farmers’ property.
The second point raises the powers of “ factors ” under
an old law, incorporated in the consolidated statutes
of N. S. Wales (1899). A factor can pledge goods
not his own for their value. But in this case the debt
was incurred prior to December 13, when the wheat was
delivered. Moreover, it was a variable debt; and that
was “ going outside the Factors Act, which was not an
Act which the Court should be anxious to stretch the
meaning of.” And indeed it isn’t. So the Court decided
that the City Bank had no legal lien on the wheat—in
other words, that the co. had no right to pawn it—and
the bank has to pay Costs, which must be very large.
Just what the bank will lose isn’t certain yet: it says it
has “ other security for a large part of its claim.” But if
the other security were worth what it ought to be, the
chances are the bank wouldn’t have struggled so desper-
ately to get this wheat.
The N.S.W. Factors Act needs a more careful
overhaul than it has had by Parliament for many years
past; also, the powers given under it need to be more
clearly defined. Until they are, it seems a pretty
dangerous thing to touch an advance to a factor.
A factor, first of all, is briefly an agent who has
possession of the goods—it is in this respect that he
differs from a broker. Having possession of the goods he
apparently can do almost anything with them, and the
third party is protected. “Almost” anything—it was
that “almost ” which knocked out the City Bank. Even
if the third party knows that the factor is only a factor
and not an owner, any advance he makes, “ not other-
wise invalid,” on the security of the goods, is bind-
ing upon the owner—which doesn’t seem to be as
definite as it might be. Practically it says, “ Every
valid advance is valid.” But the Act does not
legalise any such transaction made in bad faith,
and it does not extend to any “ antecedent ”
debt. That is to say, if a factor has an overdraft and the
bank wants more security, and some goods come into the
factor’s hands, the factor can’t pledge the new goods. If
the factor has pledged any goods, the owner can pay off
the debt and get his goods back. He can’t get them back
otherwise, even though he hasn’t had a penny of the
money which the factor has got by way of advance—
provided that the advance was valid. Altogether
there appear to be pitfalls all around the factor,
and into most of them other people are much more liable
to drop than the factor himself. The City Bank has
dropped into one, and it deserves a lot of sympathy—
presuming it didn’t know what the true relations of the
co. and the farmers were. But if the case had gone any
other way, the farmers would have been entitled to even
more sympathy.

This little Socialistic infant was born in 1902, but it had
the bad luck to come into the world wearing hobbles.
The object seemed to be, not to see how much work it
could do, but how' much it could be prevented from
doing. An amending Act was passed in 1904; this didn’t
remove the hobbles altogether, but it added a few links
to the chain, so that the infant has been able to move a
bit more freely since then. The bank, for instance, can
now grant a loan in order to pay off a private lendlord’s
loan or to buy stock. In such cases, though, the advance
can only be to the extent of 10s. in the £ of the value of
the selection ; and the advance in every case must stop
at £BOO. Naturally, progress has not been rapid, and the
total amount outstanding after six years’ operations is
only £119,344. Apart from the limitations imposed
by the law, two or three things seem to be
mainly responsible. First there is the delay. The
Private Enterprise bank usually has a manager on
the spot, or not far away from it; while the State Bank,
having such a comparatively small business as yet, has to
send out inspectors, and they have to travel long dis-
tances, which means a weary wait on the part of the ap-
plicant. Also, during the past two or three years, money
has been plentiful, and the private bank has been un-
usually affable to anybody who looked like a borrower:
moreover, “ the land ” has been getting one of its periodi-
cal booms, and the man who proposed to go on to it has,
therefore, been treated with unusual affability. Later on
things may change ; and then, when a lot of people come
to the conclusion that “ the land ” is not what it was
cracked up to be, the State will be expected to hump a
lot more of the burden of financing the selector. It
isn’t in times like the last three years or so that the need
of a State Land Bank is most conspicuous; it is in the
less affluent days that have been in the past and are
bound also to be in the future.
Further details of the Queensland Land Bank’s
operations follow :
Advances Expenses

1908 .. 119,344 16,716 1199 1 0 1
The expenses are heavy ; if the advances were 20 times
greater the cost could be reduced to perhaps 6s. in the £,
and the other 14s. odd could come off the interest bill.
Fortunately the State lends to the bank at 3 per cent.;
otherwise, in view of the heavy expenses, the cost
to the borrower would be very heavy. As it is,
he has to pay 5 per cent., which is much more
than he need pay if the bank had the support
it ought to have. Besides the expenses there are the in-
evitable losses to provide for. During 1906-7 eleven pro-
perties fell into the bank’s hands ; and in the past 12
months another ten. This is not a favorable experience.
Still the foreclosures, due in almost every case to the
abandonment of the holding, have not involved serious
loss ; the advances have been small, for apparently the
holdings have as a rule been thrown up very soon after they
have been acquired. For last year the losses of principal
totalled only £3l. Nevertheless with less satisfactory
seasons heavier losses must be looked for in a country of
such violent changes as a great deal of that part of Queens-
land on to which settlement is now being pushed; and
the very respectable growth of reserves must therefore be
viewed with great satisfaction.

The present accounts do not show the full effect of the
recent decision to issue 17,500 bonus shares, to be paid
for out of the reserve fund. Only the first step could be
taken until after the end of September ; that first step is
the consolidation of the various reserves. At March 31
there were a reserve fund, and a guarantee and insurance
fund, and a dividend-equalisation reserve, the lot total-
ling £329,136. To make up the £350,000 necessary to pay
for the 17,500 shares, £20,864 is transferred from the
Profit and Loss balance; and the £350,000 will now be
transferred to capital, bringing the latter up to £2,850,000.
That, of course, will leave no reserves apart from the
profit, and loss balance (£36,369). But the C.S.R. Co.’s
reserves have always been under suspicion. Look at the
top of the table above and see how the co. just managed to
make a few pounds more than its dividend ; then note
how, having decided to pay a jubilee bonus, profits
suddenly sprang up £50,000 in one half-year. It
is fairly obvious from this that the co. had
been making undisclosed profits. It is able to stuff
them away by paying for new plant, etc., out of ordin-
ary revenue, treating the outlay as working expendi-
ture ; and so it can equalise the declared profit. What
the real reserves are nobody knows who doesn’t know
more than the published accounts tell. But it is possible
to get some idea ; to arrive at it, let us go back 10 years:

In the half-year ended September, 1898, the net profit
shown on the basis of the book value of refineries, mills,
and plant was at the rate of £7 16s. per cent, per annum
(the net profit was £85,404); in the past half-year the
net profit was at the rate of £lll4s. per cent, per annum
on the same basis. That suggests that there have
been very large additions to plant in the past 10
years which have been paid for out of undisclosed
profit and have not therefore been added on to
the book value of plant, etc. Certainly a larger
proportion of the true profits may be disclosed now than
was the case in 1898, and that would, of course, affect the
comparison. Still, whichever way you look at it, the co.
has been and still is tremendously profitable. But the
investor takes risks when he considers only the possibility
of still bigger profits and still more bonuses. The Com-
monwealth’s sugar business is being put on a? white-labor
basis ; and if it should be found necessary, the big slice
of profit which this co. takes out of the industry will
certainly be cut into in some way if the size of the present
slice imperils the white-labor basis.

They have all had a pretty bad time during the past year,
especially those that do much marine underwriting. Yet
it doesn’t seem to have been the marine business that
damaged the look of this co.’s figures ; for the marine losses
lately have run this way : —1905, £13,006 ; 1906; £13,671;
1907, £17,705 ; 1908, £BBl5. Curiously, however, though
the accounts show separately the amounts actually paid
out in fire and marine losses, unadjusted losses are
lumped, and so are premiums ; so a true comparison of
fire and marine results is impossible. For instance, in
the past year the co. may have eased off marine business
and pressed the fire business; if it did so, the increase in
the expense rate would also be accounted for, because
under most circumstances fire business costs more to get.
In that and other respects recent results work out like
this: —
Loss Expense
Premiums. Losses. Expenses. Rate. Rate.
1895 .. £58,499 £32,855 £19,580 56.2 p.c. 33.5 p.c.

1908.. 98,493 51,012 41,942 51.8 „ 42.5 „
The underwriting profit for the past year was thus only
5"7 per cent, of the premiums, which is getting down
pretty fine. Interest and rents brought in £7993, or at
the rate of £3 Bs. per cent, on the average of
the investments. It is a low return; still there
is this to be said —the co. only has £13,000
out on mortgage. There is £56,000 in freehold
property also ; but all the balance is in a very liquid form
—deposits or Government securities. There would there-
fore be no heavy losses if the co. had to realise promptly ;
and that’s an aceident which is liable to happen to any
fire insurance co. Yet the return is low, even allowing for
the large proportion of deposits and Government stock,
and suggests that the co. isn’t getting much of a return
at present from its £56,000 of freehold property. As for
the co.’s policy-holder, his position is very comfortable.
The co. has a paid capital of £85,402, representing £2los.
a share; and shareholders are liable for another
£7 10s. Paid capital added to the reserves makes
£242,752. The only way to test a co.’s power to
meet its policy engagements is to compare the
total net premiums for a year with the total of the capital
and reserves ; and it will be found that, for every £lOO of
premiums, this co. has provided £246 Bs. of funds, while
last year’s average for the 19 great British cos. is only
£l4l for every £lOO of premiums. This very fine position is
largely due to the excellent results achieved a few years
ago ; for while those excellent results were coming in
the co. did not rush up its divs., wherefore in five years it
accumulated no less than £58,283 of reserves. The share-
holders have now the benefit of that in increased earnings,
while the policy-holders have the benefit of it in
strengthened security.

In 1898 this society had a squaring-up. The assets,
according to the books, were worth £180,876; on re-
valuation they were written down to £118,151, or £62,725
less. To provide for this shrinkage, two-fifths of the
capital was written off, leaving £98,916 ; and, after allow-
ing for debts, there was a balance of £10,532, which was
turned into a contingency account to provide for repairs,
possible depreciation, etc. Since then, things have been
getting on very nicely. The table at the top of this shows
that there has been a steady recovery of capital as sales
have been effected: it appears as profit on sales, but
really it is capital previously written off in excess of
actual requirements. Other details are shown hereunder:
1899. 1906. 1907. 1908.
Capital .. .. £98,150 £97,523 £97,523 £96,387
Deposits .. .. 2,997 16,659 21,936 22,427

Advances .. 40,510 117,105 127,952 138,271
Other assets .. 5,172 1,346 . 1,329 258
The “ other liabilities ” which have increased consider-
ably during the year are mainly overdraft; presumably
deposits have not been available. Yet the security is un-
questionable ; for the capital and reserves amount to
£136,112, and the total liabilities to the public are only
£33,104. Hence there is over £5 of shareholders’
money to protect £1 of the public’s. Certainly some of
the shareholders’ funds may be represented by doubtful
debts ; but the writing down in 1898 appears to have been
very thorough, and the return from current business is
so good that there is evidently very little unproductive
stuff among the assets. The additions to reserves have
been substantial. During the last few years Victoria has
had a very prosperous time, but the swing-back, no
doubt, will come—probably it’s on the way now. Then
losses will almost inevitably drop in ; but, unless there
has been most serious over-valuation of securities accepted
by the society during the last four or five years, this in-
stitution ought not to be at all inconvenienced in pro-
viding for the losses. What ought, however, to be
remembered is that, since those losses are almost
bound to come with times that are worse than
the average, some of the profits that have been earned in
times that are better than the average are scarcely true
profits at all. Anyhow, they can’t be regarded as defi-
nitely earned until the slump has been felt as well as the
boom. The man who buys any shares on the basis of
boom profits forgets that; presently he wakes up to find,
not merely that profits from current business have fallen
off, but that, in order to provide for losses on old busi-
ness, some of the accumulated reserves have to be bitten
off as well.

This co. was formed in 1896 to take over the Newcastle
Permanent Investment and Building Society’s business ;
a large proportion of the capital of the old concern was
turned into a contingency account to provide against
losses on the sale of assets, which were mostly foreclosed
properties. The new concern, starting off with a very
modest capital in proportion to the book value of the
assets, was able to pay 4 per cent, at once. The realisa-
tions have, moreover, not been at all disastrous. In 1899
the properties in possession stood at £108,576 (book
value) ; the contingency reserve was then £47,222. The
book value is now £64,729 and the contingency fund
£40,618. Thus in nine years properties standing at
£43,847 (book value) have been got rid of at a loss of
£6604. Possibly also some small losses on new trans-
actions have had to be provided for from the same fund.
As the money has come in from the old properties it has
been put into new ones ; the advance business apparently
hasn’t been encouraged. But this shows the movements
better: —
1899. 1907. 1908.
Deposits .. .. £21,373 £9,683 £12,893
Other debts.. .. 549 276 588
Advances .. .. 36,836 20;142 26,585
Foreclosures .. 108,576 66,785 64,729
Other property .. 5,682 52,684 53,732
Liquid assets .. 9,761 8,707 7,016
Rents (apparently net, except for land-tax) returned an
almost exact 5 per cent, on the average ; that is in-
cluding the foreclosures with the other property—all of
the latter is Newcastle property. It isn’t anything dizzy in
the way of a return ; but still it is fairly clear from this
return that nothing like the whole contingency fund will
be needed to bring these properties down to market
value. If the amount of the contingency fund were
written off properties, the net return would be over 7£
per cent. Moreover, unearned increment is busy ,at
work on behalf of the city property owner. There are
plenty of very good judges who, while the boom in
country lands has been in progress, have noted that city
properties have been neglected. If an inquiry were made
as to the chief purchasers of city (and especially Sydney)
properties during the past three or four years the number
of times that the tribe of Judah has been the buyer would
astonish a lot of people : and in such matters the tribe of
Judah makes fewer mistakes than most citizens.

This is another example of a Sydney society getting up
out of the mud, notwithstanding the blighting effects of
Federation and Protection, and in spite of the fearful
things that the other States and the Commonwealth have
been doing to the capital of N. S. Wales. In 1892 the
office struck disaster and had to stop payment: at that
time it owed about £330,000. Not a word can be said
against most of the things it did subsequently. First of
all, it wrote off £2 10s. of every £lO of its share capital.
Things were, however, worse than it had suspected, so a
little later it wrote off another £4 10s., bringing the
£lO shares down to £3. Creditors had been get-
ting 5 per cent, for their locked-up money; but
in view of the heavy losses which had been made, they
consented to accept 3 per cent. After that followed some
years of strict economy which amounted to cheeseparing.
And then things began to steadily improve. Some
societies would have burst out into a dividend ; but this
society kept its nose to the grindstone until there was
what looks like a complete cleaning-up. Perhaps it even
over-did the nose-grinding business ; anyway, it found 18
months or so ago that it could write back some of the
written-down capital, and the £3 shares were written
up to £6 again. But apparently the old de-
positors are still tied down to the old basis
the basis that was adopted when things looked a
great deal worse than they turn out to be ; consequently
when these old deposits are exchanged for properties
in possession, a profit is shown on the transaction ; and
this profit is turned into what is called a Realisation
Reserve. This appears now in the balance-sheet for the
first time, though apparently all this profit was not made
on the one vear’s exchanges. This is a feature that some-
how doesn’t smell quite sweet—probably one wouldn’t
notice it if the surroundings generally had not been so
satisfactory. It is possible, of course, that the old de-
positors are getting full value for their paper (book value
of the properties, in other words, may be under the
market value) ; but if the old depositors are tied to the
old basis, which was adopted when it was believed things
were much worse tlnin they prove, then they are no
doubt quite prepared to make sacrifices in order to get
rid of the deposits. If the position has so much improved
that the share capital can be restored, what about the
old depositor—is he not to gain anything? Or is he
simply to be held to terms to which he consented on
being assured that things were much worse than they
turn out to be ?
The society is now once more doing ordinary
business : extent of it is not, however, indicated. So
far the new business and the old are not distinguished
—“advanced shares, properties in possession, etc.,”
are lumped together, which isn’t a good arrangement.
Foreclosures (old assets) ought to be separated from the
new business. Interest and rent receipts total £BO5B, equal
to about £sl3s. 6d. percent, after paying for repairs, rates,
etc. Judging from that, the properties are probably not
much if at all over-valued. The fixed deposits—prac-
tically the only liability—amount to £69,608 ; so, assum-
ing there is no over-valuation, there is almost exactly £2
worth of assets for every £1 of liability. On that showing
the depositor need not worry about his principal; while
the shareholder has probably by this time concluded that
St. Joseph’s scrip is not quite the worthless paper it
looked a few years ago, just before the bad things men-
tioned above began to happen to this allegedly distressful
city.

This co. was formed for two main purposes—(l) To pro-
vide Melbourne with a Glaciarium for ice-skating; (2)
to provide cold-storage. Business started in June, 1906,
and there was a boom. From the 10th of that month till
Sept. 30 the receipts were £10,581. But Society gets very
easily bored, and by next winter it had lost a lot of its
ice-skating enthusiasm, and there was a frightful slump
in takings—for the whole year they only amounted to
£7886. At about that point the co. decided to go on a new
tack ; as there were no steady dividends to be made out of
Society’s ice-skating, the Glaciarium was popularised, and
the co’. also went in more for cold storage and ice supply.
Unfortunately, this business seems to be considerably over-
done ; ice, anyway, has become very largely a sort of by-
product. The ice-skating craze may come again ; but it
isn’t safe to go nap on anything in connection with any
craze—except, perhaps, that it won’t last long. These
amusement novelties are, nine times out of 10, fine things
to make money out of quickly; but you mustn’t hang on to
them. If you can’t get your money back in the first
boom, you most likely won’t get it back at all. In this
case, if anything can be done with the concern as a cold-
storage enterprise, the right people hare it in hand—in-
fluential shipping and meat-export people mostly.

This co., formed in 1898, owns the Cast- Oeta and Stan-
ford-Merthyr collieries, also the Eu.-l railway, and
it has been having a rattling good time —interrupted only
a couple of years ago by a disastrous explosion and fire.
The co. was one of the early birds on the new Maitland
field, and it got three very fat worms, including the
right to build a railway, which is probably the fattest of
the three. As far as can be dug out, the East Greta
freehold mine property cost £15,679, and the Stanford
Merthyr leasehold (including the Railway Act—a paper
item) £12,000; they stood at that anyhow in 1904. Six
months ago the two items had been written down to
£15,499, and another £3OOO then came off; so
that over 50 per cent, of the book value of
the mines has been written down in four years. Plant
has also been written down ; and besides the writings-off
shown above, something is charged direct to profit and
1055—£5993 in the past 12 months. Of course the coal
trade has been unusually brisk during these last years ;
but already it is a shade less brisk, and how far the pen-
dulum will swing back there is no telling. It is quite
obvious, however, that while the good times have lasted
this co. has had a lot more trouble in stuffing its profits
away than in making up the dividend, and it is, therefore,
unusually well-placed to see any ordinary slump through.
The financial position certainly is not very strong ; before
paying the present dividend the liquid assets exceeded
liabilities by £1264. The undivided profits have, of
course, been put into rolling stock, chiefly for the East
Greta railway, so far as the last 12 or 18 months are con-
cerned. Therein lies the strength of the concern :by
getting in early and diverting profits to pay for plant,
etc., the co. has two very well equipped mines and a rail-
way, though its capital is only £150,000.

With that profit of £2245 for the six months the directors
wipe out the flotation and preliminary expenses item
from the balance-sheet (in the table at the head of this,
that item has all along been disregarded, being only a
paper asset); also £225 is written off the development
account. This leaves £lOO4 by way of reserves. The co.
has had a lot of bad luck, and doesn’t seem to have
finished with it yet. Apart from the fact that an old
sealed-up fire has been causing trouble lately, limiting the
area from which coal could be won, the boring has so far
failed to find the lower Greta seam, though indications
are still cheerful. The co., which started off with too
little capital (though that wasn’t the promoters’ fault),
had to get out of the worst of its troubles by an issue of
pref. shares on not very liberal terms; there are now
42,573 ordinaries and 20,844 pref. shares. Liabilities (in-
cluding £4OOO debentures) amount to £6346.

Some of what have been the most profitable
dredges in Maoriland have reached the point at which
they have begun to go back on their tracks and pick the
old ground over again in the struggle to squeeze a divi-
dend or two out of the skimmed milk. Among these is
the Electric Co., which began its remarkable career of
div.-paying in 1899, and since then to the end of August,
1907, had knocked out £4 13s. per £1 share ; but it only
managed to pay Is. 6d. (£1950) in the past year. Its life,
if comparatively brief, has been superlatively merry. In
its nine years £183,859 worth of gold has been won, and
£122,850has been paid in divs., equal to about 13s. sd. in
every £1 of the total proceeds.

analysis of the Barrier mining position. Read it.*
In the calculation of working costs in concen-
crating'mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

“ Looking at the successive reports of the Colonial Mutual

the attention. We seem to hear the very throbs of the
engine which in six years has raised the annual amount
of new business from £610,000 to £1,156,000, and which
increased the funds from £1,196,000 to £2,990,000 between
1890 and 1905.”*

That famous engineering feat, the Zigzag,

by a series of tunnels. The Railway Commissioners, who
are carrying out this work, have ordered eight Reavell

class of work. Reavell Compressors are coming rapidly
into favor with mining men, who appreciate the absence
of suction valves and the high volumetric and mechanical

Of the past year’s profit £lOOO is, however, put aside as
an “allowance for probable reclamations ” —that is to say,
for probable over-payments received on account of con-
centrates sold. Further, though a gross profit of £12,418
is shown, £3970 spent during the half-year has been
charged to capital account. This has gone into the plant
—most likely in making necessary modifications and ad-
justments. The co. has, on the other hand, charged all
mine development up to working account; but even then
it amounts to Only Is. 4d. per ton of ore broken. As it
probably takes a good deal more than Is. 4d. to develop a
ton of ore as an average, the amount allowed for develop-
ment is probably insufficient; in that case the net profits
(£5155) are over-stated. Six months ago, for instance, it
was estimated that there were 500,000 tons of ore available.
The quantity is now put at 480,000 tons, so that not
enough has been spent on development to maintain the
reserves. Which means that during the past six months
the mine has been to the extent of about 20,000 tons, or
one-third of its output, living on past development
expenditure.
The ore treated by the Junction North during
the half-year was 62,126 tons, which gave 9445 tons con-
centrates, worth 62 - 7 per cent, lead and 30'70z. silver,
equal to 5922 tons lead and 28,9960 z. silver. Taking the
net profits at £5155 (though that doesn’t allow for the
probable reclamations and the deficient development
charges), the profit was thus at the rate of 17s. sd. per
ton of lead. Costs, in other words, absorbed all the silver
and all the lead except 17s. sd. per ton. Lead averaged
£l3 4s. sd. per ton ; silver 2s. 2£d. per oz. Costs there-
fore amounted to 2s. 2Jd. per oz. silver and £l2 7s. per ton
of lead. Yet it is practically certain that the co. cannot
keep that up, because it has for the present an unusually
favorable contract for the sale of concentrates ; and that
contract will run out in February next. The co.’s finan-
P° sifci , on as Kveatly improved; including stores
(£7337) as liquid assets, the latter exceed the liabilities by
£16,186.
Supposing the J unction North could make a net
profit of 17s. 6d. per ton on all the lead in the mine, what
is it worth ? The ore last half-year yielded 9\5 p.c. lead : at
that rate there are 45,600 tons of lead in the 480,000 tons of
°!; e Tithe mine. At 17s. 6d. per ton of lead, that works out
at £39,900, or 4s. 7d. per share. As the market values these
shares at about 225., it is obviously discounting the future,
both as to probable ore developments and as to metal
market improvements. And it will be just as well to
remember that when things do improve
* * * „
The only thing talked of now at Broken Hill is
the coming conference of men and managers to consider
the working agreement which expires at the end of this
year. The first meeting will take place 10 days hence,
lhere are very good prospects of averting a strike—in
spite of the fact that the Government has sent up 50
extra police but it is probable that some of the mines
will take a very long Christmas holiday. The British for
instance, hasn’t finished its last Christmas holiday yet.
At Mt. David (N.S. W.) poppet legs have been
put up, and there is nothing to prevent the shaft being
continued and levels opened except the expense ; but
that is a serious matter in view of the very moderate
returns that are being obtained. Consequently for a
start all the known lenses of ore are to be developed and
the reserves increased-before a more expensive campaign
is undertaken. Developments on the whole have not
come up. to the expectations formed a year since ; but
the 220 ft. level is being prospected, and No. 3 south-east
level from the winch winze has been extended 420 ft. on a
good joint, so there is a chance of a new lens of ore
making in this direction. For a low-grade mine Mt. David
s P° or reserves > an< i their steady depletion has enforced
the old slow-going, hand-to-mouth policy again.
Great Cobar (N.S. W.), in spite of its new plant,
isn t sending out the tonnage that was glibly talked of a
while ago ; the output was going to be doubled, but if it
weren t for the aid of the old plant things wouldn’t be
much better than they were before. The new plant is
not running - too smoothly ; the water jackets are causing
? dea * of double. n d, to make things still more uncom-
fortable at Cobar, the espionage system is still in full,
furious blast.
* * * *
Baker’s Creek (N.S.W.)has lately spent a lot
of money on exploratory work with poorresults. Smith’s
reef, at No. 18 level, split up into leaders, and as a dis-
tinct reef it seems to have practically disappeared. Still
this is not the first time it has vanished through some
local disturbance, and afterwards made again. Develop-
ment work has become very expensive at deep levels, so
before sinking the main shaft they are trying to find out
if conditions are likely to improve below No. 18 level.
That level is not all barren, for stone is being stoped
from it and sent to the mill. The directors have about
£6OOO, but they are as careful about spending the money
as they were a year or so since, when a dividend was ex-
pected. In this respect Baker’s Creek is a happy con-
trasc to the extravagant English co. next door. Looking
at the cash balance, and then at the date of the last divi-
dend (Dec., 1900), no one can pretend that the mine is an
encouraging proposition ; so the directors are not to be
blamed for looking hard at the money.
Things have taken a distinct turn for the better
at the Harden (N.S.W.). When the reef was cut at the
No. 4, or deepest level, it was small and poor ; but the
east drive, now in 76ft., has 4ft. of stone in the face, half
of it worth 895., and the other half 28s. per ton ; and the
general appearance of the reef is still very good.
The half-yearly estimate prepared by manager
Nicolson shows that on June 30 the Ivanhoe (W.A.) had
£2,325,955 worth of stone in sight, split up as follows :
east lode, £1,371,821 ; middle lode, £738,886 ; new lode,
£130,008; Boulder loop lode, £85,240. After “ checking
measurements and taking samples throughout the mine,”
the consulting engineers (8., M. and Co.) put the value
at £2,557,494. Beckoning the expenditure at 255., and
allowing for loss in residues, Nicolson’s estimate gives a
profit in sight of over £5 per share, while, according to
8., M. and Co.’s figures, it runs out at £1 more.
* * * „
Great Boulder (YV. A.) now has 250 ft. of lOMwt.
ore opened up at 2350 ft., and, as the faces are in much
higher values, the jjrospect of this level turning out a
good one looks assured. So far, the drive at 2200 ft. has
averaged 33dwt. for a length of 1000 ft., and the shoot is
wide.
Oroya-Brown Hill (W.A.) is now installing a
vacuum plant with a capacity of 16,000 tons per
month, which is expected to be working early in the new
year. Preliminary assays of the residues indicate a
satisfactory profit.

The proposal of the directors of Gwalia Con-
solidated to supply a syndicate with 200,000 of the re-

take as many of them as they could afford, and let Lionel
Robinson have the rest.

Boyd Aarons, who recently arrived from
London to manage Chaffers (W. A.), has cabled back that
he considers the tributors have indicated the existence of
a well-defined continuous lode, which he believes will
live in depth. So far the tributing parties have proved
348 ft. to an average depth of 60ft., and Aarons estimates
that it is worth 14dwt. over a width of 108 in. The tri-
buting parties have crushed 3268 tons between them for
21dwt. per ton, but the stopes in one claim produced
higher grade ore than the drives, which accounts for the
average being above Aarons’ figures. The Board has de-
cided to adopt the new manager’s recommendation to
sink a shaft on the shoot rather than crosscut from the
old workings for it.
More favorable reports from Chaffers, Han-
nans Star, and Boulder Main Eeefs has caused these and
other speculative ventures in the neighborhood to have
an attraction for scrippers altogether out of proportion to
their value, while some rich telluride met with in the
Perseverance has added about £250,000 on to that show’s
market valuation. Admitting the improvements, still
the luck of those who pin their faith to any of these con-
cerns hangs by a very slender thread.
* * * *
Lancefield shareholders (W. A.) are being stirred
up again. In April last £30,000 was screwed out of them
to remodel the mill and keep a few pressing creditors at
bay ; but as the altered plant didn’t realise expectations,
the co. stopped work in July, with an accumulated loss
from Feb. 28 of £7961. The Board now confesses that
more extensive alterations are necessary than were
planned in April, and to make them, and also keep another
lot of creditors quiet, shareholders are asked to find
£35,000 more. As £10,500 is still left out of the cash pro-
vided by the April reconstruction, this will give the co.
£45,500 to play with, minus a bank overdraft of £lB,OOO,
which, the Board states, “has been arranged to stand
over.” London and West Australian Exploration Co.,
which ranks as the biggest shareholder, wants the addi-
tional capital to be raised by an issue of £35,000 pref.
shares, to be repaid as to 100 per cent, out of the first
available profits, and thereafter to be entitled to a 20
per cent. pref. dividend and a, pro rata distribution with
ordinary shares. In other words, it wants to force the
ordinary shareholder to find more money—or put up
with very unpleasant consequences. Practically the
scheme means: “ Provide this money, or lose your
interest in the show.”
* * * *
From Greenbushes (W.A.): Last month only
a little over 48 tons of tin was produced, as against 70 tons
for the corresponding month last year ; and a great many
mining plants are lying idle. Unfortunately the failure
of the State-subsidised operations at the South Cornwall
has given confidence in the district a shock. The Govern-
ment is willing to make a further advance, but the towns-
people apparently have less faith in the mine than the
Government experts, and refuse to take up any more
shares. A good deal of what some people regard as the
pick of the tin-bearing country is locked up, and the
holders want wajres to come down before they make a
move. Meantime, to give the idea that a wag-e-reduction
is the proper thing-, some of the mine-owners, etc., in the
district are pulling a long face and crying Stinking Fish.
* * ■* *
Karangahake, at Meekatharra (W.A.), cleans
up its first return some time this month. Sydney people
control this mine, which appears to be in 'good hands.
But the mill hasn’t had its say yet ; consequently the
point whether the co. needs a safe for its gold or a grave
for its remains isn’t settled. Prospects are nevertheless
reported good.

It must have been from a fellow-feeling that the
Melbourne unemployed waited on the Stock Exchange
the other day. They are true brothers in misfortune
A ever was a worse time,” say young bloods and old
foxes alike. Jobbers are practically an extinct race. At
Cup time most of the regulars shut the doors each race
day ;it was really no use keeping them open. Brokers
hit only themselves when they were persuaded to deprive
the outsider of a com. whenever he brought business to
them ; and they begin to realise it now.

The whip-up of suitors at the Maori Queen
meeting in Melbourne, the other dav, proved that old
friends were loved the best. Sergeant Nolan’s “ come-
hither” was pitched too masterfully, and the set of his
moustache was too stiff to win favor. A rasp is not wanted
in first-class joinery. Besides, some new-comers, who
have not had to trim up a derelict to make it a decent
craft, came to the conclusion that they ought not to find
fault with the ark when the old craft was carrying them
to solid ground. No one claims that the Maori Queen
dredge has done justice to mining at Bright. But it is
now on a good lease, new plant is being built, and when
the latter gets to work divs. should be doubled. Share-
holders want to find out whether the fight was not really
over water rights secured by the Maori Queen recently.
White Star, IVEt. Useful, Grippsland. struggles
along on the off-chance, like an outsider in a steeple-
chase. In all £30,000 good cash has gone underground, and
£lO,OOO has come out. This does not choke off the palpi-
tating call-payer, who is dribbling out pennies to try if a
2ft. reef cut m a low-level tunnel is to make a man of
him. The co. had some luck in getting good gold at the
surface, but it can only find squibs below. Yet the
country is kindly and misleading.
<( When Butterman Middlewick declared for
“ Dosset ” he hadn’t been tin-mining, especially with a tin
dredge. The Dorset works on th e Hi ngaroorna River (Tas.)
and is the biggest dredge in the Commonwealth. But
it has not turned out to be prime Dossiet yet. There are
unpaid p.n.’s over the dredge itself, and a bank overdraft
to represent loss on working account. These two items
tot up £2400, a solid slab of debt when a fickle metal
market has to be relied on. Directors pipe out that the
dredge got too far north, and so worked into poor ground ;
and Downie adds to the tale of woe by punching the
plant for being out of order. Two cumulative misdoings
that look like convicting directors of sitting in Collins-
street instead of visiting the mine.
* * * *
Since Tasman and Crown Lyell Extended, out
beyond Lyell Peaks, lost Tom Hills, no one has sounded
the mine timbrel very strenuously. Recently a bit of
argentite, got in the rise off No. 2 tunnel, was reported ;
so the tum-tum was heard again. The Age has been
caught by the fascinations of the big drum, and it tells the
uninitiated that argentite is sporadic in occurrence, and
comes from the “leeching” (happy error!) of the sur-
rounding country. Ore reserves count up about 40,000
tons. Supposing they average 8 per cent, when put into
the Mt. Lyell pot. whither they will go, there will be
about enough profit left to strengthen petty cash account
sufficiently to stand a round of drinks. What the day-
light yearns for is Sticht’s sampling results, and the
“ why ” he turned the show down after wanting an
option. London is pretty heavily stuck over Extendeds,
and may do a boost to get out. Others ought to take
warning and flit when the stock is on the up-grade.
For the nine months ending September 30,
Queensland’s production of minerals other than gold has
largely increased •by comparison with 1907—copper by
1000 tons, silver by H0.0000z., and lead by 1500 tons, but
tin has dropped 770 tons. This increase has, however,
not been nearly enough to balance the falling off in price,
and value has dropped from £1,571,956 to £1,123,027. For
the last three months the values, without exception, fell
away ; there is a total difference of £130,000 compared
with the same quarter of 1907. The metal slump has
made a greater production of copper and silver of less
value, while the same cause has played havoc with both
production and values of tin and wolfram ores. The un-
certainty of the market for the latter mineral has stopped
minmg to such an extent, that the output has fallen from
£27,200 to £BOOO.
* * * *
Of the Queensland yield of 3767 tons of copper
for the quarter, all but 400 tons is from four centres.
Mount Morgan gives 1730 tons, Herberton 971 tons, Mount
Perry 388 tons, and Rockhampton 278 tons. Of lead, 1565
tons out of a total of ,1709 tons comes from the Herberton
centre, which produced also 869 tons of tin out of 1170 for
the whole State ; 100 tons of the balance is from Stan*
thorpe. In values Herberton again leads with £157,627
out of £391,196. Mount Morgan (apart from gold)is next
with £104,188.
The Mount Spurgeon Tin Co., which has a good
property near Mount Molloy (Q.), has not been fortunate
so far in the handling of it. Money has been wasted
through false economy, and the management, which did
not approve of modern methods, has found itself in
difficulties. The directorate made its first mistake in
giving a man who is said to be a pastmaster in the treat-
ment of tin ores, the responsibility of opening up the
property. Costs have run to a high figure for mining
work, and a lot of money has been spent on a dam which
is not a success. The Board has now decided to do what
it should have done at first, and Brander, late of Smith’s
Creek and Chillagoe, leaves shortly to put things in order.
In competent hands the shareholders will at least have a
run for their money, and, if expert opinion is correct, a
little bit over.
«*. * *
O.K. ores (North Queensland) contain a very
small quantity of gold and silver, the concentration of
which, in the ordinary course of making blister copper
does not give sufficiently high values to be paid for with
the copper. Just now the metallurgical staff is engaged
in an interesting experiment of concentration by “selec-
tion, based on the fact that the first copper formed from
matte carries nearly all the precious metals in the matte.
By separating this just-formed copper from the bulk, a
product is got containing a proportion of gold and silver
high enough to be paid for by the purchasers of the copper.
A report from the mine states that, of the 74 tons of
copper produced for the fortnight, five tons were
“ selected,” containing 60oz. gold and 490 z. silver, the
whole of which would be given away if distributed through
the bulk of the copper as usual; six tons of the copper
usually shipped u'ould probably carry a little over loz.
gold. Further experimental work on these lines should
be worth while.

From Gympie (Q.): “ Phcenix ” (B. 29/10/’08)
misquotes the paragraphs on which he commented, and
twists the statements they made. He says “ Home-
ward Bound and Peter and Paul are mentioned as show-
ing coarse gold.” The paragraphs said nothing of the
sort. The Homeward Bound and Hibernian (the Home-
ward Bound without the Hibernian is adifferent property
altogether), which lies west of Peter and Paul lease,
has proved very fair gold in both Pringle and
Hibernian reefs, and the co. proposes to make a trial
crushing’ next week. “Phoenix” also says Great
Northern shares can be had for Is. 9d., with no
buyers. Sydney papers for the last week or so
print Sydney quotations—buyers, Is. 9d. and Is. lOd. ; no
sellers. As to the assertion respecting the “ enormous ”
amount of capital spent in proving the Two Mile deep
ground, the whole thing is absurd, as the Two Mile shaft
and No. 1 North Phoenix were the onlv shafts previous
to the Great Northern which cut the top or Phoenix
slates. These old cos. did little more than sink rheir
shafts. Great Northern has absolutely beyond doubt
proved Phoenix slates, and a reef carrying gold in them.
The late Queensland Government Geologist Bands and
present Geologist Dunstan are quite satisfied about the
Two Mile being an extension of Gympie itself, simply dis-
placed by crosscourses.
Opinions differ as i*o whether the upper levels
of the Day Dawm in the East Mexican lease, or the lower
levels in the New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers,
will eventually prove the better. Present market valua-
tion is hugely in favor of the Freehold. The first 100 ft.
in the E. Mexican’s No. 6 level, including some blank
ground near the boundary, gave an average yield of over
£2O per foot driven. But the Mexican has verv little
ground to work below No. 6, for the level is fenced off by
the N.B. Freehold boundary, to which it is parallel.
Hopes of the rich stone making far overhead were
dashed to pieces by generally poor prospects in
No. 5, over a distance of 180 ft. of driving
at that point. There was of formation
carrying 2in. of white stone on the hanging wall. Since
then, how’ever, prospects have improved considerably, so
there are better hopes, particularly as No. 7 in the N.B.
Freehold is out 539 ft., or 359 ft. further east than No. 5
East Mexican. No. 7is now following two veins divided
by diorite—one on the hanging-wall, the other on the
footwall—and the conditions hereabouts are subject to
rapid changes. A survey of the old and extensive work-
ings is to be made to determine the best position for a
shaft to work the Day Dawn.
Victory, Charters Towers, paid its last dividend
nearly two years ago. Before that, it had had a good
time, and had paid altogether £234,100 to shareholders.
There are 200,000 shares without liability as to calls, so
reconstruction would be necessary if much money were
required to sink a deep shaft. The Victory has a lease of
50 acres to the east of the E. Mexican, and if the shallow
levels of the Day Dawn prove payable, the Victory will
have a good deal to hope for. There are several mines
sinking, or preparing to sink, below the Brilliant forma-
tion in hopes of striking the Day Dawn, so the old Vic-
tory, which once was so rich, may have another slice of
luck. Small but payable crushings have of late years
been taken from different formations.

Peter and Paul, at the Two Mile, Gympie
(Queensland), is worked by a co. which was formed to
prove, or disprove, the existence of slate beds, which,
from outcrops to the west of the lease, should exist in
the property. A shaft is being sunk for the purpose, and
is now dowm some 270 ft., proving a reef and conglomer-
ates like those overlying the Phosnix slates in most parts
of Gympie. These slates are deeper than some expected.
The management was evidently ignorant of work done by
the No. 1 North Phcenix Co., which, 20 years ago, sank a
shaft about 450 ft. deep to the north of Peter and Paul
shaft, some 600 ft. or 700 ft. aw’ay, and proved the top
Phoenix slates at 300 ft. The Peter and Paul position is
somewhat similar. Homeward Bound and Hibernian Co.
has proved gold in two reefs in slate country ; and from
the dip of the slate the Peter and Paul shaft should prove
it at about 600 ft. Thus this property should have tvvo dis-
tinct beds of slate in 700 ft., call them what names you
please.
The N.S.W. Government Savings Bank has
thought better of it and has thrown overboard the recently-
imposed fee of Is. a year for keeping each account. Also
the fee of the same amount for issuing a pass book has
been dropped down the same hole.

BALLADE OP ONE HOSS TOWN.
[For The Bulletin.]
This is the song of a country place,
Where twice three hundred bipeds stay ;
Where men engage in the cheerless chase
Of futile crusts in a languid way ;
Where the gossip of women the livelong day—
Defaming some virtuous Mrs. Brown—
Keeps time to the noise of brats at play
In the long main street of One Hoss Town.
Ah, well may the angels make grimace
At the kindly things these ladies say ;
At the covert nudges that meet the case
When Miss Smith passes in garments gay.
Patriarchs feeble and grand-dads grey
Consort in the bar of the “ Bull and Crown,”
And discuss the effect the price of hay
Will have on the world, which is One Hoss Town 1
Whoso comes hither will have to face
(Though much at the rudeness he may inveigh)
The insolent stare of the “ really naice,”
And the brazen gape of “ the common clay.”
Still, hitherward travellers sometimes stray;
Though God alone knows what brings them down,
This stands to their credit, they fade away
As soon as they can from One Hoss Town 1
To fittingly finish a modest lay
That sings a people of great renown —
Amongst themselves—l humbly pray
One Hoss is a singular country town !

As the last cutter from the Pearlers’ Picnic rounded
Queen Point, a south-easter shrieked through the Strait

The boat heeled over and sank.
Gorita, the Japanese, clutched at a floating case.
Something white and inanimate drifted by. It was

face to his.
A spar had struck the sheller man (who loved her)
heavily on the head. Blood from the wound dripped
into his eyes and blinded him.
He laughed shrilly, and brushed away the blood.
A shark’s fin split the Strait.
He laughed again.
A tide-wave crashed him against the case, and he waked.
“ Boss,” gasped Gorita—“ Boss, more better you catch
another case.”
The man choked.
“ Boss, more better you get another girl! ”
The man struok.
“ You get! ” he snarled.

On his recent trip to North Queensland,
Chief Protector of Aborigines Howard visited
Mornington Island, one of the Wellesley group,
in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the only place in
Queensland territory where the aborigine hasn’t
at least a nodding acquaintance with beer and a
dim knowledge of the gentle art of cadging
“tickapen.” Attempts had been previously
made by others to approach the Mornington
blacks, but without success. Mr. Howard found
that they knew nothing about the use of tobacco,
and would not eat bread or sugar, though they
were got to taste those things. Their food con-
sists chiefly of bulgeroo nuts, the fruit of the pan-
danus, fish, and a species of large yam. They are
healthy and, although lean, are strong and active.
They build no gunyahs, merely placing a few
bushes round their camp as a breakwind, and
generally lead the Simple Life in the superlative
degree.
David Lindsay writes : “Quan ” errs in
his reference (B. 8/10/’08) to L. A. Wells and my-
self. Wells, according to “ Quan’s ” story, joined
the Elder exploring expedition, and subsequently,
when David Lindsay gave up the job, he was
appointed leader. “On that trip he discovered
the Murchison River country, W.A.” As a fact,
I never gave up the “ job,” and Wells was never
appointed leader. He simply carried out my
instructions to make a flying trip out eastward
from the Murchison, and, being favored with
heavy rains, was able to make a successful trip.
The Murchison River country was discovered
before Wells was born, and the gold rush to that
region had taken place some months previous to
our arrival there. Re his long walk in the
Northern Territory, to which “ Quan ” refers, it
was nothing out of the way. I fancy many sur-
veyors average five miles a day in their ordinary
work, which would be 3600 miles in two years.

“ Copra Bug,” from the Solomon Islands :
We had a British man-o’-war down here the other day,
“ avenging ” McKenzie’s murder. It came, and, by way
of vengeance on the black, did a lot of damage—to the
white. The sum total of destruction was the burning of
a native village ; and the native village usually consists
of about eight or ten leaf huts in the last stages of decay,
and furnished with nothing but an obnoxious odor. A
man-o’-war’s-man was badly burnt trying to rescue a pig
with a broken leg, which had been left in one of the huts
by the departing villagers. Blood-curdling, wasn’t it?
This sort of thing only tends to deepen the hatred that
the Solomon Islands (Malaita) nig already holds for the
white settler.
These particular islanders don’t reason things out. If
they think they want a white man’s scalp, they will get
one ; it’s immaterial to them whose scalp it is—friend’s
or foe’s, it’s all the same. The only plan is to cow them,
and you can’t do that by burning their huts—that only
makes them want a scalp worse than ever. Therefore 99
out of every 100 of the' whites (and that doesn’t leave
many over) wish the warships would keep away alto-
gether ; for their “ punitive ” visits nearly always leave
things worse for us who have to stay behind and face the
consequences—and sometimes we don’t even have the
chance to face them ; they take us in the back.

“J.G.”: In these drays, when anything
that even looks like a horse costs about £2O,
cocky pretty regularly buys his stock on time-
payment. In bad times he got out of the habit
of paying cash, and he hates to do it now. And
therein he is apt to fall in and do great damage to
himself; for the t.p. horse-agreement is liable to
kick with all its hoofs at once. There was a case
at a Yic. County Court the other day. Early in
the year a contractor named Bourbon-Tudor, or
something else, had two unbroken horses knocked
down to him for about £4O each, whereupon, as
usual, he signed an agreement to pay in instal-
ments. He paid about £7O. Then he missed an
instalment. When that happened, the auctioneers
sold their rights to a horse dealer for £ll. The
horse dealer inspected the slightly-damaged agree-
ment, and promptly sold the horses to a cocky
(call him Plantagenet), and took them away from
the amazed Bourbon-Tudor. After getting over
his amazement, Bourbon-Tudor took the horses
away from Plantagenet, who also became an
amazed man. When he had thought it over, he
brought the County Court action previously men-
tioned, alleging illegal detention and use of a pair
of horses. Judge Box in due course gave a ver-
dict for Plantagenet, and ordered Bourbon-Tudor
to hand the horses back and also pay about £2O
for using them. Further, if he couldn’t or didn’t
hand them back, he had to pay Plantagenet £75
for them, in addition to the £7O he had already
paid the auctioneer. After reckoning it all up,
and probably mortgaging his hen-roost and the
missus’ sewing-machine to pay the Costs, Bourbon-
Tudor is now liable to speak disrespectfully of t.p.
horse-agreements. He is even liable to speak dis-
respectfully of the Law and the County Court.
“Werrimee” on didelphys and other
strange things:—
Says “Itan” (B. 22/10/’08): “The diamond snake
of Tasmania is harmless; the diamond snake of
Australia is exceedingly venomous. The carpet ditto
of Australia is only venomous at certain periods
of the year; the Tasmanian carpet is most deadly.
... Our porcupines have little in common with the
real Mackay. The Australian salmon is not a salmon,
and his lordship the sclinapper is known by another
name in Queensland, while they call a different fish a
schnapper in that part. White ants are not ants.... Our
’possum is a phalanger ; Australia is supposed to possess
nine different sorts of ’possum, and there is no ’possum
among the lot. The perch in Queensland is not the same
fish as the perch in the southern States. The silver
bream of Melbourne is a white bream in Sydney and a
grunter in Queensland.” Now the diamond snake of Aus-
tralia (Morelia spilotes) is harmless; the diamond of
Tasmania (Hoplocephalus super bus) is venomous. It is
known in Victoria as the copperhead, and in N.S.Was
the large-scaled snake (Krefft’s name). The Australian car-
pet (Morelia variegata) is never venomous at any period ;
while the carpet of Tasmania, also called Tasmanian
black ( Hoplocephalus curtus ), is identical with the deadly
Victorian tiger snake, with the brown-banded snake of
N.S.W., and the yellow or Mallee snake in Riverina. The
brown-banded, which is the generall.y-reeognised popular
name of this much-alias’d wriggler, is considered to be
the most venomous and aggressive of all Australian
snakes. Our quilled ant-eaters are echidnas, not porcu-
pines. The “ white ants” are known as termites. Con-
cerning the ’possum, the didelphys of America are called
opossums, the phalangers of Australia are plain possum
—with no apostrophe before the “ p.” “ Itan ” will find
the two varieties so labelled in the Australian Museum,
Svdney. The perches—which include the Murray cod
(bligorus macquariensis) —are a large family. Queensland
fresh waters contain the giant perch (0. gigas ) of the Fitz-
roy—identical with the “Palmer perch” of the Mackay dis-
trict, which can be heard grunting under water ; the barra-
mundi (Ceratodus) of the Dawson and Burnett; a Brisbane
River perch (Rules haswellii) ; the river groper; the
yellowbelly, plentiful in the Ward, Nive, Bufloo and
neighborhood. In the sea are the Government bream, or
arrow fish (Genyoroge Sebae), and others. In southern
fresh waters, the Murray perch (0. mitehellii ), silver perch
( Therapon richardsonii), golden perch ( Ctenolates am-
biguus), and many others ; while along the coast there
are the wirrah (Plectropoma ocellatum), old wife (Enop-
losus), of .Sydney, identical with the zebra fish, or bastard
dory, of Melbourne ; Sydney salmon ( Arripis salar),
javelin fish ( Pristipoma hasta ), hussar ( Genyoroge amabi-
lis), black rock cod ( Serranus damelii), boar fish (Histi-
opterus), and trumpeter perch ( Therapon quadrilineatus).
The schnapper, which is not found much north of Towns-
ville, is one of the bream family. It is, in fact, often,
called the red bream Other members are black bream,
tarwhine, black fish (Girella), and drummer (G. elevata).
What is called “ silver bream ” in iMelbourne is the white
trevally (Caranx georgianus ) of Sydney, and belongs to
the horse mackerels.
THE GOOD OLD LIAR.
ANCIENT PARTY : “ Yes, I’ve seen every Cup run, and I’ve backed the winner 51 times,
counting the last.”
PUNTER: “But there haven’t been 51 winners altogether!”
ANCIENT PARTY : “ P’raps not. But I backed some of ’em twice.”
In the annual report of the Queensland
Protector of Aboriginals the master of the ketch
Melbidir, which is employed by the Department
to patrol the beche-de-mer fishing grounds, throws
some light upon the way the Japs, in the in-
dustry treat the blacks they employ. When Mr.
Monkey has taken out his fishing license he signs
on two or three hands, and then heads for the
nearest big Binghi camp, where he fills his boat
with men, women, and children. He takes them
to the reef, where he works them for all they are
worth; then puts them back on the mainland,
along with a few bags of flour, some tobacco, and
a piece or two of print calico. He then takes
another crowd on board, and treats them simi-
larly. Should Binghi think he has not been well,
enough paid, and be foolish enough to mention it
to the Jap, he is persuaded to think otherwise by
the aid of a lump of mangrove firewood.

“Liarbird”: In dear old Lunnon they
have queer ideas as to what is required for an
“ Aboriginalities ” column. From an English
paper 1 learn that “ a blackbird’s nest has
been found lodged under a North-Eastern
railway meat waggon, which has just been
returned to Tweedmouth after travelling with
goods from Edinburgh to London, back to
Edinburgh, and then on to Tweedmouth.”
That is a good enough start, and anything
might be expected to follow except that
which the original-souled writer does let
forth, with no sign of an abundant
and overflowing wit: “ The waggon
was being cleaned when the discovery
was made.” This, so far, is a fair
sample of an English Aborigin-
ally. Not a quip here, nor a
quirk there—just a plain, home-
made statement of the lie without
anything to cheer the reader on his
way. Not a remark to the effect
that the blackbird., owing to its har-
rowing experiences among the meat,
turned grey during the trip; not an
English reference to the fact that the
bird was obviously Scotch, seeing that it
paid no fare; no remark that, since the
discovery was only made on the waggon
being cleaned, none of the railway hands
then employed were able to say how long the
bird had been nesting in the car. The par. has
a plain, square ending. “In the nest,” writes
this bloodless pattern of English liar, stolidly,
“ were two eggs ! ”

“Pick”: Before the weary-way contro-

and I were droving sheep from Kiandra to Aibury
(N.S.W.). The sheep delivered, Iprepared for the
return journey, only to find that Blucher was
missing. It turned out that the licentious fellow
had gone on a debauch with some newly-found
companions. So I started alone, and, travelling
through Tumut and Talbingo, reached home at
the end of eight days. There I found Blucher,
who had arrived five days previously! He had cut
across country, via Tumbarumba, a road totally
unknown to him. Blucher was my old ragged-
coated sheep-dog. He always maintained a stony
silence as to his jag, nor did he ever disclose how
he had found his way through the strange country.

Hitherto the emu has been a wholly-pro-

fresh country with the spiny curse, he’s to be only
little more than a half-protected fowl in future.
From April 1 to August 31 he may be shot on

Harry Stockdale writes about the real
bushman :
Major F. A. Dove, D. 5.0., has delivered himself in
Sydney of some daring statements, some of which are
quite at variance with fact, while other of his suggestions
have so little claim to originality that they were pro-
posed and all but brought into use a quarter of a century
ago.
The Major has “no doubt at all that we ought to have
a special corps of scouts besides the two scouts that are in
each section of every regiment in the army and cadets.”
Some 25 years ago I proposed a corps of 50 picked bush-
men, each man being the crack of his immediate district
(light men preferred)—men who cohld ride anything, live
on the roughest fare, and could go east, west, north or
south and find their way anywhere. The writer maintains
such men were available, himself amongst them.
But the Major describes his scouts : “ They must be
able to read a map. The popular notion that any bush-
man, educated or uneducated, makes a scout is altogether
wrong. I know it, because I saw in South Africa bush-
men, thorough bushmen, who could not read a map go out
and lose themselves in no time—hopelessly at sea as to
where they were. I have heard men riding behind me
out there say, ‘He doesn’t know where he is.’ They
didn’t know. But, of course, I did know, because I could
find my way about by the map. The uneducated bushman
may be able to scout in his own paddock, but in a strange
land he is nowhere.”
Now, this is the grossest libel on the real bushman of
Australia that I ever read, and I, for one, deny it in toto.
Further, I maintain that education (excellent though it
be) has little, if anything, to do with finding your way
about new or strange country. As for the Major and his
map, what use would they be in new country which, for
hundreds (aye, thousands) of miles, had been neither sur-
A SQUARE DEAL.
MICKO THE MITE : “ Give us a ’and up with
these ’ere bottles, an’ next time yer wants ter
lumber me I’ll yo quiet.”
veyed nor mapped ? Besides, many maps are quite inac-
curate.
Now, a “ thorough bushman ” —wbat an experienced
Australian bushman would call a good bushman—could
go out for 20 or 50 miles in any country, Africa or any-
where else, without map or chart, and return with cer-
tainty to his camp, able to relate where he had been and
the nature of the country. How did the pioneers know
where they were ? Where were their maps ? And were
they all educated ? How do the men Outback, and those
of the Far North, even at the present day find their way
about where there are no fences for hundreds of miles?
Certainly not by maps.
The fact is, the Major is bushed. Perhaps he has mis-
laid the map. He talks of what he knows little, if any-
thing, about; and, though I have no doubt he is no end
of a dashing soldier, his own words show he has much to
learn re bushmen and their ways. I maintain that the
man, educated or otherwise, who on going out scouting
from a camp must have a map should also have a guide
to bring him back.
By the way, how would the Major act if taken by sur-
prise, and if.the map were lost? The Major adds —“There
is no such thing as a bump of locality.” This may
be quite true as regards the Major, whose education has
taught him to rely upon his map. Possibly that is why
he is so cocksure about it.
Finally, as the Major has no faith in even thorough
bushmen being able to know where they are outside their
own paddock, I would ask him how horses and cattle re-
turn hundreds of miles to their own old home. Is it by map,
or by knowledge of locality ?. A picture of a lost horse
sitting down to consult his map would be a valuable addi-
tion to Sydney Art Gallery.
A TRIFLING CHANGE.
YANKEE DESERTER (three weeks
out back): “Guess I liked
this dern Australia the
first week I was ’ere better
than what I do now."
“ Flinderino ” : Twelve months ago I paid
a visit of inspection to Sam Sing’s banana planta-
tion. Since then I have called in at dozens of
other Chinese fruit gardens in North Queensland,
and I found them all the same. The ugliest
Chinamen that reside in Aus-
tralia are employed in the
banana-growing industry. They
swarm in the Johnstone River
and Cairns districts. Follow
any of the side-tracks running
off the main roads, and you
are sure to arrive at a
clumsily-constructed wooden
gate leading to the banana-
grower’s humpy. In opening
the gate which operation
takes fully five minutes, for the
portal is tied with the Gordian
knot and all the relatives
thereof —you arouse about 39
nondescript dogs, all of which
rush at you and make as much
noise as 139 ordinary tykes.
Sam Sing comes tearing out
of the humpy and frantically
endeavors to silence the mon-
grels with 6ft. of fence-rail.
Arming yourself with a billet
of wood—bricks are scarce in the
North —you succeed in wound-
ing half-a-dozen of the dogs, and
the rest slink away wearing
their tails between their legs.
It is said that the Mongolians
collect all the stray dogs they
can get hold of, and fatten them
up for New Year and other festi-
vities. The Chinaman is a noted
epicure. The plantation is usually
five acres in extent, and £1 per
acre is the average yearly rental the
Chinaman pays to the mean white
landlord. He does not confine his
operations solely to the banana, but
cultivates pine-apples, granadillas,
oranges, mandarines, paw-paws, and
other fruits. Incidentally, he runs a
poultry farm. The Celestial’s humpy is a
thing of interest and smell. The structure is a slab
affair of two small compartments. One of the
rooms is used for storing seeds, fruit, and imple-
ments ; the other is drawing-room, kitchen, bed-
room, and everything else combined. At the
side of the humpy is a lean-to, containing a minia-
ture joss and a number of smellful joss sticks.
The joss sticks are always burning. From three
to nine Chinamen live in a humpy, and they sleep
on wooden shelves surrounded by ancient mos-
quito netting. Boiled rice and stewed dog are the
staple food.

“Malaya”: “A lone, drear, awesome
place is the Australian bush ’’—thus “ Prooshan ”
(B. 23/7/’08). In my opinion it is time this guff
re the out-size “ loneness,” “ drearness,” etc., of
the Australian bush was squelched. I have some
slight knowledge of German forests and Indian
and Malay jungles, also I know my Australian
bush. I fail to find much difference in any of
them as regards “loneness,” and they are all
equally “ drear and awesome.” The lack of evi-
dence of animal life that “ Prooshan notes in
Australian forests is not remarkable. Here in the
Malay Peninsula, except for an occasional early
morning monkey cat-call, the most quick-eared of
residents hears nothing and sees less of wild
creatures. The life is there, equally in forest,
jungle and bush, but it is not m evidence. It
takes a longtime, apparently, for some people to
lose the childish idea that forests, etc., are chock
full of birds of gaudy plumage and wild beasts, all
clamantly anxious to draw the attention of the
passer-by to their presence. In Asia, which is
(vide newspapers) teeming with game, it requires
about a week’s tramping, a long pocket, and much
endurance to get a shot at a wild cow.
“ Maorilander ” : Rua, the Maori prophet,
is taken very seriously by his brown followers.
One of Rua’s many prognostications ran to the
effect that King Edward was soon to land on
Maoriland shores and give back to the Maori his
old-time predominancy ; but those who wished to
share in the blessings and advantages of the new
dispensation must of necessity become consistent
followers of the mighty long-haired Rua, and sur-
render unconditionally to the old brown fraud all
their worldly possessions. And it was understood
that Rua preferred cash. That was where the un-
scrupulous pakeha scored. In realising ready
money for Rua’s coffers the follower disposed of his
horses and cattle recklessly to any willing pur-
chaser. “ You want to buy te horse?” questioned
one Rua enthusiast of a wary pakeha. “How
much?” asked the pakeha. “Oh! very good,
twenty pounds,” complacently replied the enthusi-
astic Ruaite. “ Oh—too much ! too much ! Five
pounds,” said the white man. But to this offer
the Ruaite turned a deaf ear ; and it looked as if
the deal was off till the white man had an inspira-
tion. He offered £25 —£5 cash and £2O payable
the day of the King’s arrival at Gisborne. So the
agreement was drawn up, and that Maori is short
of a horse even unto this day. Also Rua is £5 to
the good.
"DOG.”
[FOR THE BULLETIL. ]
If you want to loom important and to fill the public eye ;
If you’re eager for what people call success,
To cultivate a fluency in speeches you should try
And a taste for things immaculate in dress.
You must take the chair at meetings and the talk mono-
polise,
Into every local movement you must bog,
Making dignity the feature of the goods you advertise,
For the most important attribute is “ Dog.”
You will find a store of courage it is just as well to own,
While knowledge comes in handy now and then ;
But they really matter little when your claim is fully
shown
To be reckoned with “ our leading public men.”
Geniality in private is a thing that often tells,
While logic your opponents may befog ;
And tactful generosity wide admiration spells—
But all the same they’re not so good as “Dog.”
If you put on “ Dog ” artistic, with the rest you may
dispense,
For it’s dignity and style that do the trick.
And assertions carry twice the weight of any arguments
(If you make them loud enough they’re sure to stick).
In explaining things suspicious and in twisting troublous
facts,
Go the whole complete and comprehensive hog ;
And remember, as you slap your chest, in all your daily
acts
That the one thing indispensable is “ Dog.”

CALVES IN THE CROP.
[FOR THE BULLETIL. ]
A hundred years ago, it seems,
When I was quite a little lad,
A voice would mar my morning dreams —
The double forte voice of Dad :
“ D ” (blanks were just as blanky then)
“ The calves are in the crop again !”
I would not stop to meditate,
But, shoeless, shoo those calves and cuss
To find that, six times out of eight,
The brutes did not belong to us.
Then Dad would mend the fence and say :
“ I’ll put a new one up some day.”
Those calves grew into cows, and I
Left boyhood’s days, a dream, behind ;
And, though I really meant to try,
I’ve fostered Dad’s old fault, I find ;
For all my crops of diligence
Boast nothing but a broken fence.
I’ll put a new one up some day—
Maybe. But morn by morn I wake
To find fresh calves are in the hay ;
And, whilst a futile fist I shake,
I know that I shall have to mend
Old fences on until the end.
’Twas thus I spoke to Andrew Kerr—
Who sometimes takes a glass with me—
A grizzled, srrey philosopher,
But kindly ; and, “Friend,” answered he,
“ Life unto each some joy allows,
What if those calves were full-grown cows?”

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be taken of
communications insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must appear on MSS. No liability is under-
taken re contributions voluntarily submitted, whether
sent by post or handed in; and no MS. will be
returned unless stamps (of any State) accompany.
Reval: The Bulletin pays for tales and verses
on acceptance, even though that may be a considerable
time before publication. If acceptance (or rejection) is
delayed a week or two, that only means that the editor
has got the tired feeling and the work has got in arrear.
Everything else is paid for on publication, but the writer
is expected to send in his little bill to the Accountant,
Bulletin Office, with such particulars (date, page,
column, number of paragraph in column) as will
enable said Accountant to get on to the item. Then the
said Accountant gets a hustle on himself, or ought t 0....
G.R.C.: Your cutting is too old, too ordinary, too fatu-
ous. The Hatters yarn has been torn to tatters and
jumped on and otherwise mishandled so often that it is
hardly worth touching now, and the stuff about “ highly
educated people,” “professional men,” etc., having to
“sweep, dig, and cook for themselves” in Australia is
immune from assault, owing to its inherent asininity.
If Theosophists absorb that brand of poppycock at this
time of day they are incorrigible, and past argument....
Carlyle G. : Rather an unpleasant idea for illustration •
Bagman : Can’t find the information you want Sybil :
Both show promise ; neither is up to the mark... .John
Murray: Almost strong in places, and very weak in
others.... G.E.: Too verbose and long-winded Melville
S.S.: Yes, it is improved ; but is still not up to the mark.
....Sweep: The contract was too big for you. Try smaller
subjects C.T.W.: Nonsensical without being amusing.
...A.P.: Your essay is too heavy by lcwt.7Jlb. ..D.M.b.:
Might have done for a picture suggestion if London
Punch hadn’t pictured it long ago. . .V.G.: The lurid-
ness of it is calculated to shock a police-court attorney,
disgust an anecdotal bagman, and make Rabelais shift
uneasily in his grave. In a word, it has been fired....
Voltigeur: If your “cutting” joke means what it
appears to mean, it is shuddersome ; if it doesn t, it is
pointless.... Pete : You lose. There are no steeplechase
fences in N.S. W. or Victoria as big as those at Liverpool
(England). The “logs” opposite the grandstand at
Randwick is probably the stiffest fence in the Common-
wealth ;it is about 4ft. Jin. high. “ Becher’s Brook, at
Aiutree, is about 4ft. llin. high, and has a 6fc. 6in. ditch
on the “landing ” side ; the “open ditch,” another big
National jump, is a thorn hedge about sft. high, with a
6ft. ditch on the “take off” side. The undue proportion
of accidents locally is due to the facts (1) that most Aus-
tralian fences, unlike those abroad, are solid and can t be
brushed through ; (2) that horses aren’t “schooled so
carefully here as they are in the United Kingdom Khu
Dair : You shed nought but murk and unreliableness on
the Grace Watson-Lyne embroglio. Grade Sinclaire has
levelled no charges against Oom William, neither has
Grade Graham—who never did anything worse than win
a Wonderland City beauty quest. As to Mrs. Smith she
still lies low Nuckawn :No apology, however grovel-
ling, can condone your parody on “The Burial of
Sir John Moore.” The epigram re being in debt
while in the midst of life is a chestnut....
Clarence : A gross misstatement in the first verse killed
your little “Song of Penitence,” viz. :
Oh ! lily, pure and tender,
At my feet
Dead you lay.
It is a matter of notoriety among students of botany that
lilies don’t lay. Hens do Snave : What are you essay-
ing to hand us re Jeffries, after refereeing the first fight
between Burns and Philadelphia Jack O’Brien, offering to
hand his championship belt to Burns and then fight him
for it, because the latter demurred to his (Jeffries’)
decision? Burns’ first fight with Jack O’Brien was on
Nov. 28, 1906, and Jeffries publicly gave up the heavy-
weight championship to Marvin Hart on July 3 of the
previous year.... Joe B. : Yarn about Yiddish clothier
blessing the little flies is not quite as old as Judaism, but
it is blamed near it.... W. F. Mac. : Photo of mummified
’possum only of moderate interest.... .T.Q. A. : The hand-
writing is the best feature of “ Micky Dooley’s Rest.”
Michael is not funny enough for all the space you accord
him... .Jobber: Average age at death of Australian
males is 39’73 years, and that of females 36'82 years
J.E. W. : Note that you meant to say that “ the Murrum-
bidgee and Queanbeyan Rivers stopped running in the
years ’39 and ’40,” but knew nothing as to the Cotter
Creek having stopped running in those years—though
“it may have,” for all you know. Note further-
more that you did not camp in the bed of the
Cotter, but in that of an adjacent stream....
Corringarra : Sony, but your rabbit yarn is quite com-
monplace ; takes a good deal of skill to make a rabbit
yarn anything else nowadays L.J.Y.: If “Song of
Labor ” were as good as some of the patches, it would be
very good indeed .. . Pharos : Received (with request for
prompt payment) one poem, two slips of paper, one pin.
Thepaper ’is spoiled, but the pin is as good as new
R.R.T.: Indifferent verse about a hard-worked subject....
Grill: No ; we don’t exactly say, “ Lord forbid ! ” but the
stuff would have to be a lot brighter than sample sent....
Tomtit: Not bad for a first effort. All you lack is technical
skill W.W.8.: You were evidently feeling good when
you wrote it, but it reached us when we were feeling bad.
Nathan S.: The material might have been made much
more of D. Buck: Select an organisation which plays
that class of play and submit to its manager. Or try it
on an actor. Or send it per friend to London to try on
the managers there. The chances of rejection in each
case are practically' equal—loo to 1. Some advice may
appear on Red Page shortly J. R. Smith: Can’t
identify book referred to.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Groper : No treatment with Indian ink nor any Bristol
board that was ever fashioned will render acceptable the
portrait, labelled “ The Troubles of a Young School-
teacher,"dealing with a female with scarlet legs— Robt. E.
Burke: We acknowledge—with sorrow—thereceipt of your
sketch. It is an awful crime, but we acknowledge it
H.E. : Picture of burglars’ deputation too deadly
Norman S.: Too crude, though the idea might be worse
if it tried Robert R. : Stick stamps and address on
back of picture. When there is a big mail and three or
four men are working on it, the hopeless picture which
has no stamps for return may have been indignantly con-
signed—a mere crumpled ball —to the basket by one man
about an hour before another opens the meek letter
with the lengthy' explanation and the two stamps.
Thomas Bent as a giraffe is a failure... R.R.:
Pencil drawing, with joke about sex of dog, firmly
rejected,... A.R.E.: Poor sketch, and joke absolutely in-
solvent.. . .Coe (or some such name) : No points about it.
. S. Fry': The shadow on the wall isn’t convincing....
E. A. Stokes : The dude picture is built on a weak joke,
and the magnificent black-and-white effort about a small
boy and his first William-goat deals with an old subject.
The goat has been a fragrant animal since the days of old
Father Genesis, and merely to state that he smells is a
trite business nowadays Kooka : Seems to be only
based on a pun, and a very humble pun at that R.A.8.:
There is some promise about them ; that is as far as we
care to go.

In the old days Kidston had a dog
and Philp had a dog.
Philp lent Kidston his dog, and
Kidston was a proud man with two
dogs.
Later on, Philp whistled, to his dog,
and it left Kidston. Kidston’s old
dog had got so" accustomed to being
with Philp's dog that it left also.
Then Kidston hadn't any dog.

Mr. S. H. Sbeard, representing the Gramo-
phone Go., Ltd., of London and Sydney, is now en route
for Sydney, and is due here on Saturday next. Mr.
Sheard comes with the intention of giving a number of
concerts throughout Australasia. He brings with him a
large and improved gramophone, known as the “ Auxeto-
phone,” which, we are told, is a marvellous instrument.,
increasing the volume of sound to a considerable extent
compared with that of the-ordinary gramophone. An-
nouncements of these concerts will be made in due course. *

Of the seven supposed half-seceders from
Queensland Premier Kidston, five (Airey, Kerr,
Mann, Murphy and Woods) are ex-Labor men,
and two (Cottell and Sumner) were new Kidston-
ites. The new faction is a fairly brainy thing,
anyhow, and, with Airey at its head, may cause
trouble. But Cottell and Sumner are not yet
quite sure whether they have seceded or not.
The wild man who was recently captured
near Carcoar (N.S.W.) had a lot of curious
properties. They included nearly 7ft. of stature,
a bushel of hair, eight years accumulation of dirt,
the fee-simple of a cave, a battle-axe weighing
361 b., two iron clubs, a bank balance of £4 12s, 3d.,
some rags, an attack of bronchitis, an alleged
relationship to a duke, and a quantity of hal-
lucinations. He said he had been a follower
of Christ for ten years, of Sltmson for ten years,
and of Hercules for eight years. Likewise he had
an infallible recipe for producing hair and a rooted
objection to being washed —in fact, it took two
policemen to wash him and then he had to be
scrubbed in the thick of battle, so to speak.
After that he died.
BLOW YER!
Bent defying the lightning.
McDonald, the Labor candidate for
Solomon’s seat in the Northern Territory, is a
postal employee. A few years ago he crossed
the continent on his cycle from Port Darwin t»
Adelaide, and then, being in need of a little exer-
cise, continued his journey to Melbourne. He
proposes to do his campaigning on his wheel, rid-
ing over the 2000 miles between Adelaide and the
northern coast before . lection day on December 5.
Melbourne parsons, when deputationing
Thomas Bent, pull the nether limb of that large,
crude individual in the most shameless way, It
is always a Rev. Somebody who appeals to Tom-
my’s vanity with gush about his “sincere patriot-
ism,” the “ lustre of his name ” and his “earnest
devotion to religion’s cause.” One has actually
referred to his “ simple, bluff piety.” The “ cloth ”
gets down into deep and muddy bogs of hypocrisy
when it is out after money or money’s worth.
Died at P’ran (Vic.), the other day,
Edward Newbigin, aged 69. He was a native
of Newcastle-on-Tyne (Eng.), and first came to
Victoria in the momentous period of the gold
upheaval. A quiet, philanthropic old gentleman,
he spent much of his leisure time with the deaf
and dumb and as treasurer of the Eye and Ear
Hospital; the rest of the time he was senior
partner in James Paterson and Co., coal mer-
chants and ship-owners. He leaves behind him a
big reputation for squareness, kindliness and
modesty.
Among the constables who recently made
up the Federal rolls in Victoria is one who is
quite prepared to step out of the rut if
need be. One elector’s occupation was t
set cjown as “ advertect.” This knocked
out the officials, and they cross-
examined the collector. He admitted
the word wasn’t in any dictionary, but
he said the householder gave it to
him, and, on examination, it ap-
peared to him to be etymologically
correct, as it was derived from the
Latin ad and vertere , to turn (as in
advert or advertisement), and the
Greek tekton, a constructor (as
in architect). Wherefore “adver-
tect,” an advertisement builder.
The paralysed officials gazed
wonderingly at the learned John,
and let it go at that. Another
constable’s love for exactness in
details gave the officials a shock.
When the owner of a name on
the old roll is not discoverable
it is usual to write “Re-
moved,” “Not known” or
“Dead”; but when this enu-
merator’s roll was over
hauled, opposite the name
of a woman was “Mur-
dered,” and against that
of her husband “Hanged.”
The old building on
the corner of King and
Elizabeth streets, Sydney,
so long associated with
law and lawyers, is now,
through the removal of
Curtiss and Barry to
Belmont-chambers,
Castlereagh-street,
finally shorn of its tie
with the law courts. Over
50 years ago those plain-
faced brick offices were the
centre of attraction for some of
the brightest practitioners in
N.S.W.—such men as Chief Justice
Darley, the late “Jack” Want, Ed-
mund Butler, H. Garrett, G. Knox, and
others on the barristerial side, and a small
army in the attorneys class. Mr. Fred Curtiss
was in the old premises from the date
of his first attachment to the law.
The death from pneumonia at
Newtown (Sydney) of Dean Slattery
removes one of the oldest and best-
known priests of N.S.W. He was
born in Kerry (Ireland) 75 years ago,
and was educated at Maynooth Col-
lege, where he had as class-fellows
Archbishop Carr, of Melbourne, and
Bishop Higgins, of Ballarat (Vic.).
He came to Australia in the middle
’6o's, and was for a while assistant
to Archpriest Sheehy, at Darling-
hurst (Sydney). Then he moved down
to Monaro, and spent a number of
years in Bega and Cooma. He moved
to Newtown in 1892. He was one of
the 60 priests who stood behind the
late Archbishop Polding when he laid
the corner stone of St. Mary’s Cathe-
dral (Sydney), and of whom only two
now survive—Archpriest Sheehy and
Vicar-General Dr. Carroll. The Dean
was for years a martyr to gout, and it
was no unusual circumstance, while at
Cooma, for him to address his con-
gregation while sitting in a chair on
the altar, because he was unable to
stand.
Of the leaders in the present
industrial unpleasantness at Broken
Hill—marked so far by nothing more
serious than an extraordinary flood of
molten language—only one was to the
front in the last big strike of ’92.
That one, “Bob” Hewitt, was boss
of the pickets in the former trouble.
He was then among the most harm-
less of men (he had, in fact, written
some tame verse at times); yet he
was included in the batch of “con-
spiracy ” prisoners who were sentenced
at Deniliquin. Except Hewitt, not one of the
“conspirators” who were then sentenced is now
in the Labor movement.
“ J.” writes :
The statement made by the two Sydney morning papers
that 0.-J. Darley of N.S.W. “has not yet decided”
whether or no he will settle in England after his resigna-
tion is piffle. It is a matter of common knowledge that
the Chief hankers to shake the dust of these parts from
his frock-coat and tall hat for ever, and expire in the
land of his forefathers. He thinks, politically, the
thoughts he thunk a quarter of a century ago. In
his view Australia has been “ruined by Labor
domination.” He believes firmly that Sosh will deposit
its baggage here shortly, and that it will resemble the
Beast of Revelation and will ravage the country far and
wide. The disaster that overtook G. Reid’s futile cam-
paign against the monster three years ago worried the
old man more than anything had in decades. Since then
he has held with ever-increasing doggedness to the view
that what with Protection, and the prospect of a fresh
instalment of democratic legislation from the hands of
the Australian Parliament, N.S.W. is no place for a fine
old Anglo-Irish gentleman to dwell in retirement in. He
has sold “ Lilianfels,” and is trying desperately hard to
do the same by “ Quambi,” his Woollahra residence. His
favorite daughter and her offspring are permanently
established in the Cold Land. He has not a solitary
interest in these parts that he may not bear away with
him aboard a P. and O. liner, and very few things outside
his family, his savings, and the local climate that he
wants to bear away with him.
Although it is 100 years since Governor
Bligh was in New South Wales, we find frequent
mention of his name apart from his governorship,
Just now portions of his grant at Newtown are
being brought under the Real Property Act.
Governor King and Governor Bligh were very
accommodating towards each other. Before King
retired he gave Bligh a grant which the latter
named Camperdown, and on his assumption of
office, Bligh made King a grant.
A TRUE FRIEND.
N.S.W. Premier Wade (to juvenile dressmaker):
“ I'm trying to get you a week. Am I
not a friend? ”
JUVENILE DRESSMAKER: “ But others are trying
to get me 5s."
WADE: "But they can't."
JUVENILE DRESSMAKER: “ Why not, sir?"
WADE: “I won't let them."
Police-magistrate Gordon, of Adelaide, had
a joke fairly thrown at him lately. He had just
sentenced a wife-deserter to a month’s imprison-
ment, when the wandering one exclaimed wildly,
“It’s all a mistake, your Honor. Give me time.”
And the P.M. had only to make the obvious reply,
“ Certainly. I’ve given you a month,’’ to gain a
reputation for judicial wit.

Naturalist John Rainbird, 91, passed out
recently at Bowen (N.Q.). He was amongst the
pioneers of “The Hospital,” as Bowen was ori-
ginally called, going there as a collector of speci-
mens for the Sydney Museum. This work occupied
his time till a few years ago, when extreme age
intervened. What Rainbird didn’t know about
bugs and caterpillars is mostly unknown even to
the caterpillar itself. Many land shells and other
specimens carry his name as the discoverer.
“ A. 8.” writes
Sydney jiu-jitsu expert Stevenson is a man who is
tracked through life by the demon of advertising. He
has little use for notoriety himself, but it comes his way.
Seven or eight months ago the Manly undertow got a
strangle hold on Stevenson’s neck and started to carry
him off to M.L. with half a ton of seaweed round his feet.
The usual batch of heroes set out in pursuit, and when
Stevenson was got ashore 10 of them gave him first aid
simultaneously, and he was nearly torn in pieces. The
language of the corpse is said to have been considerable.
Hardly had Stevenson got over having his life saved
than he was in a harbor collision in which one boat had to
be beached to avoid foundering. The suit of clothes he
was wearing on that occasion was scarcely dry before the
American fleet came along, and he was one of the dozens
who were knocked off the platforms of the King-street
trams. Since that date Stevenson has been thrown off
switchbacks, knocked down by bolting horses, mistaken for
Andrew Higginson and introduced to Adolphus Bent.
He lives in a perpetual atmosphere of battle, murder and
sudden death. His latest exploit was to get into an
altercation with a snake at Lithgow a few days ago. The
disgraceful incident i terminated in the snake being
knocked out, and then Stevenson cut several large
pieces of snakebite out of himself. It is a strenuous life.
Passed over lately, at Hawthorn, William
John Lormer, a mediocre gentleman, who reached
Victoria in 1853, and who for most of the subse-
quent years was an advocate of high Protection
and cold tea. But his most notable exploit was in
moving the Law (represented by ex-Judge
Hartley Williams, as a Royal Commission) to
investigate the irregularities of three Victorian
honorariums, Rappiport, Baxter and Bird.
Went over lately in London, the Rev.
Hussey Burgh Macartney, youngest son of the
late Dean Macartney, of Melbourne. Deceased’s
visage used to be rather familiar in Melbourne
Anglican circles, in which he floated for about 30
years as incumbent of St. Mary’s, Caulfield. Up
to the time of his death he was superintendent of
the British and Foreign Bible Society in London —
a job he had held since 1898. He was 68 at the
perish, and will be faintly remembered for a while
as his obstinate old father’s less obstinate son.
“ Six-and-Eight ” : I beg to differ both
with “10-2-4” and “ One-three-six ” regarding
G. H. Reid’s conduct of the Crick case. In my
view he did Crick serious damage by putting in as
evidence the report of the Royal Commission.
The Court could not take cognisance of the report
unless it was in evidence ; and the Crown could
not put it in. Reid did. Which was just what
the Crown wanted. Then he attempted to argue
that the Court should only read the parts that
favored Crick—an absurd proposition. Had the
report of the Commission not been before the
Court there was no scintilla of evidence on which
to strike Crick off the rolls. Reid’s trouble is that
he flounders in law and trusts to his undoubted
ability as an advocate to cancel the evil wrought
by his flounderings—and his trust isn’t always
justified.
In Ambrose Pratt’s life of David Syme,
just published, David claims to have been one of
the original proprietors of the great Mount Eger-
ton mine, atEgerton (Vic.), a show that was the
subject of one of the most expensive Australian
law cases, and which paid £1,200,000 in dividends.
Syme and a mate pegged out the claim in ’53,
worked it, and had got out a paddock of rich
stone, but were delayed for want of crushing
appliances, and during the delay half their mine
was jumped. The Commissioner gave a verdict
against the jumpers, but again the mine was
jumped, and after some months spent in a vain
attempt to get redress, the two sold their small
remaining interest and cleared out. Otherwise,
Victoria might have had a great mining magnate
in place of one of the most serviceable newspaper
men that ever conferred the boon of brains and
democratic sympathies on a young country.
About Smith :
Died last week at Newtown (N.S.W.), aged 64, James
Francis Smith, ex-M.L. A. He was a Parliamentarian of
much experience. Away back in 1885—and perhaps
earlier than that for all this paper knows to the contrary
—he was elected (with 1899 votes) as one of the three
members for Newtown. He came second, Water Jug
Foster beating him by seven votes. The third member
was Gibbes—he who once sat unofficially in the Speaker’s
chair with the waste paper basket on his head and
hollered at George Dibbs. In 1887 Smith lost his seat
(1284 votes). He was beaten in 1889 (1722 votes). He
was beaten again in 1891 (1098 votes). Newtown had four
members then, and Smith was tenth among 11 candidates.
That was when Cotton and Holy Hindle headed the
poll. In 1894, when the single electorate system came
in, four candidates stood for Camperdown, and Smith
(355 votes) came third. In 1895 he was second (450
votes). In 189 S he was second (431 votes). That
time there were seven candidates for the seat. At
the election of 1901 Smith came into his kingdom
again, and headed the poll with 759 votes. In 1904
he was again top with IS4I votes, beating six competi-
tors. Smith’s Waterloo happened in 1907, when Stuart-
Robertson captured the seat, and the old member was at
the bottom of the list, with only 294 votes out of the 6531
polled. A good Protectionist and a persistent candidate
was J. F. Smith. Also he was a persistent dweller at New-
town, where he hung out for 40 years; and a persistent
alderman (he sat in the local council for 37 years, and
never missed a meeting except when detained by illness ;
he even tried to get out of bed to attend a Council meet-
ing two hours before his death). T i finish with, he was a
persistent father, and 10 of his 13 children survive him.
May Smith rest in peace !
SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE.
Women, by some means or other, were much nearer
infallible physiognomists than men. In electing men to
Parliament they should ask themselves, “ Is this the sort

INDIGESTION RIGHTLY CURED STAYS
CURED.
Not by Treating the Symptoms, but by Mak-
ing the Stomach Strong Enough to Do
the Work Nature Expects op It.
Indigestion should not be neglected, for by de-
priving the body of its proper nourishment, it
grows steadily worse. Stimulating medicines
ruin the already weak stomach by making it work
beyond its strength. Predigested foods do not
excite a flow of the digestive fluids and by disuse
cause the stomach to become weaker. Neither
should be used. Nowhere is the tonic treatment
with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills more clearly use-
ful. Its principle is to enable the stomach to do
its own work by building up the blood and giving
tone to the nerves. When these are once more
restored to their normal health indigestion dis-
appears and the cure is permanent.
The experience of Mrs. William Outtriss, Eve-
leigh Street, Redfern, Sydney, should be read by
everyone who is suffering with indigestion.
“Indigestion attacked me real badly about two
years back,” said Mrs. Cuttriss. “I got worse
every day. The least bit of food would lie heavy
on my chest as if it were cold lead, and such
horrid shooting pains would go right through from
the breast bone to my shoulder blades. I’d feel
all the time as if I wanted to get rid of that
weight but couldn’t. My appetite was good. I
had the longing to eat, but daren’t, for I knew I’d
suffer if I did. My food didn’t seem to
nourish me at all; it seemed to have no taste in
it, and I fell away to quite a shadow. As to my
color, I was dull looking and sallow. I’d be all
right when I got up in the morning, and yet
during the day I’d be drowsy and listless. At last
a friend persuaded me to give Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills a trial. I started them five or six months ago,
I felt better with the first box, brighter and less
weighed down. I got a second box and that
seemed to remove that constant cold weight and
soon I could sit down to the meal table without
fear. My complexion returned and I began to fill
out again to my proper weight. I had no need to
do more than finish the third box. I lost that
drowsy heavy feeling. Now I can eat as well as
I could wish. The indigestion has not returned
and I don’t dread a hot day like I nsed to. My
health is now very good.”
Something to Remember.
There’s this to remember : it was Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills which cured Mrs. Cuttriss, not the
substitutes sometimes offered. If you ask for Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills and are advised to takesome-
thing else by the shopman, the best thing to do is
to take your trade where you can get what you
want without trouble. They are 2s. 9d. per box ;
six boxes 15s. 3d., of most shopkepeers and
chemists, or will be sent on receipt of price post

POLITICAL
POINTS
When the Price Government’s income-tax
proposals come on—they will be mainly in the
direction of making the tax lighter—the S. Aus.
Assembly will be given a chance to allow a sort of
rebate on account of the little Australian. Hom-
burg, who represents a largely-German district,
will suggest a £250 exemption in the case of any
income whose owner has in the previous 12 months
supported a family of six or more children under
the age of 16. The Westralian income-tax wears
a frill of that sort, only over there each child
under 16 is worth £lO for income-tax reduction
purposes.
RE-APPEARANCE OF AN ALMOST
FORGOTTEN CHARACTER.
Senator Neild protested strongly against Senator
Givens “scandalous allegations against the Sydney
crowd.” The debate was adjourned.
The Deakin Government has announced
the Constitutional alterations which it intends to
propose in order to legalise the New Protection.
The idea is to give power to the Australian Par-
liament to make laws concerning—
The employment and remuneration of labor .in any
industry which, in the opinion of the Inter-State Com-
mission, is protected by duties of Customs.
By way of simplifying things, The Bulletin
moves an amendment to the effect that the new
clause submitted to the people should just read
like this :
The employment and remuneration of labor.
It would save at least a pint of ink, and the
change has got to come sooner or later.
George Reid’s political past is always
coming up against him. He had scarcely got
fairly started that night in the Reps, at denouncing
the Deakin Government for “starving the depart-
ments ” when he was reminded how he had cut
£95,000 off the Postal Estimates when he was
Prime Minister, and reduced the Defence vote.
Then he again realised that he had stepped on the
hoop in the dark, and it had got up and hit him.
“Vulcan ” writes :
Sydney Telegrahi is shocked to discover that, if
Federal old-age pensions are paid on a N.S.W. basis (10s.
weekly to 40 per cent, of the aged population), “ every
breadwinner in Australia will have to pay £2 10s. yearly
in taxation ” to find the cash. Supposing the Tele-
graph’s figures are correct ? By giving the man
ahead his ten-shilling pension, the present Australian
breadwinner is initiating an annuity scheme, at a
cost of less than a shilling per -week to himself, whereby
he, his wife, and his sons and daughters are each assured
a similar old-age annuity, if they require it, at the hands
of the man behind. If the Telegraph knows of any
Private Enterprise person who offers anything similar at
even twice the cost, it might mention the name in large
type for the general benefit.
Item from Kamarooka (Vic.) :
Although it was understood that farmers this year
would have to put their wheat into the new standard
hags, which will hold about 2001 b. weight, thousands of
the old size bags, especially sugar bags, which will hold
from 3001 b. to 4001 b. of grain, will be used. It ought to
be somebody’s business to say that they won’t be allowed.
Indeed, it only remains for either Bent, or Tait to declare
that their trains won’t carry such murderous weights,
and the infamy will be prevented. But thusfar Bent and
Tait have preserved a masterly silence on the point.
Australia has got more or less used to its
Bruce Smith, his piebald ideas, and his curious
ways of thinking. It has ceased to be astonished
at Smith ; it knows Smith is beyond belief and
almost out of reach of imagination. Consequently
it didn’t fall down flat in its tram when it read in
its morning paper that Smith had hit common-
sense violently on the ear with the following
remarks :
The older portion of his audience should be interested
just now in what the Prime Minister of the Common-
wealth was doing to destroy loyalty. They would see
that Mr. Deakin was either wanting' in loyalty to the
Mother Country, or allowing himself to be made the in-
strument of a party that did not value the Imperial con-
nection. Mr. Deakin, while in England, had represented
that the Australian people desired to terminate the
annual -pettifogging contribution to the cost of the
British navy, upon which we had depended for our safety
for 130 years.
The unintelligent foreigner-—providing he didn’t
know Smith or hadn’t been warned against him—
would be inclined to think, after reading the fore-
going, that Premier Deakin had recently pro-
claimed a republic, amidst great slaughter, and,
after forcing Smith to fly for sanctuary to a
Chinese laundry, had dragged down the Union
-Tack and hoisted some disreputable standard of
his own. Smith’s fury at the thought of our
commencing to defend ourselves and take on one
of the main responsibilities of nationhood is
reminiscent of Peter Pan, the boy who didn’t
want to grow up, or learn, or work. It would be
all right if B. Smith were a sprightly youth in a
fairy tale. But he isn’t. Instead, he is a portly
obstacle in the path of progress, and he refuses to
be ashamed of his shamefully long loaf of 130 years
on his aged parent. Someone with a large stock
of patience should be deputed to take Smith aside
and explain a few things to him in the plain, sim-
ple language of the kindergarten.
If the Daily Mail is correct and Emperor
Bill is sincere, Germany is dead tired of acting as'
Bull’s bogey, and listening to Bull’s teeth
chattering on the other side of the
North Sea. Of course, there’s no guaran-
tee that Bill 11. meant what he is alleged
to have said, but, all the same, there is a
streak of probability in the story. The
red, straggling Empire to which we pay
our naval insurance, and which gives us
a loud sneer as a receipt, has for many
years past kept a standing bogey amongst
the first-class Powers. Russia and France
have each had a turn ; and just now it
happens to be Germany, because Ger-
many is building a navy with the idea of
ruling a wave or two for itself instead
of leaving all the hard, damp work to
Mrs. Britannia. There is no certainty
how long the existing German scare will con-
tinue, but it will probably last until the entente
blows up of its own gas and upsets international
politics once more. William’s pathetic pose as
the Distrusted Friend is humorous and interesting.
A paragraph in a recent Bulletin alluded
to Brisbane as the natural port of far north
N. S. Wales; but, as it also
pointed out. State jealousy,
by blocking the Tweed-Mur-
willumbah railway, prevents
trade flowing that natural way.
Bananaland’s first Premier,
the lately-deceased Herbert,
deserves a lot of blame for
things being as they are. When
the people of Moreton Bay
petitioned for separation from
N.S.W., in 1853, they specially
asked that the boundary line
should be the 30th parallel
(south of the Clarence); but, in
spite of the hard tight put
up on their behalf by Dr.
Lang, the opposing influence
was so strong that, when
separation was granted, in
1859, the present boundary was
fixed. The old battler, how-
ever, didn’t give in. He
carried to Brisbane a largely-
signed petition from the people
of the affected district, asking
to be annexed to Queensland ;
but the Queensland Govern-
ment took no notice of it, and so things remained
as they were.
During the no-confidence debate in the
House of Representatives, Prime Minister Deakin
heard Reid’s speech in absolute silence. Then
Deakin began to speak, and when Reid had inter-
jected 98 times, the Speaker begged him to have
some manners, or words to that effect.
THE HEARSE AT THE DOOR.
Victorian Premier Bent, being deserted by his old
friends, and being politically deceased, has formed a new
Cabinet from among his enemies and started afresh.
“ Please , sir, the gentleman inside has decided
that he isn't dead yet."
The Commonwealth duty of 3d. per lb. on
currants is another scrap of tariff that is doing
things. E. S. Brown, of Yarroweyah (Vic.), has
this year got 280 acres under Zante currant vines ;
he has drawn water from the Murray through a
seven miles long to a dam covering six
acres. There he has planted an engine and a
centrifugal pump, and four miles of 12in. iron
piping will irrigate his vines. He has so far put
£4OOO into his undertaking, and .presently he will
spend something like a regular £2OOO a year in
wages, besides employing 350 pickers in the
season. Yet if only Australia had sent more
Foreign-traders to the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment, these rich acres might still have been carry-
ing quite 20 sheep or perhaps half-a-dozen cows.
This unseemly interference with the sheep and
the cow must be very sad and depressing to the
Foreign-trader.
A letter from Brisbane, which may be
accurate or may be only interesting :
This is what really happened. Upon four separate
occasions Premier Kidston made to Attorney-General
Blair the promise of a Southern Judgeship. Upon the
last occasion the promise was made before witnesses in
the Premier’s own house. That assurance was accepted,
and Mr. Blair heard nothing more until sent for on
Wednesday afternoon after the swearing-in of the new
composite or half-and-half Government. Mr. Kidston
then informed his erstwhile colleague that the
Ministry was an accomplished fact. The small but
sturdy man said “Well?” or words to that effect.
“Well,” continued the strong man, “I did the best I
could for you, but it’s not the very best, ye’ll under-
stand. It’s the Judgeship, but not the Southern circuit.
The fact is, I was out-voted by the Cabinet.” The small
man, who had refused tempting offers to stand by his
chief, looked at the man who had been posing as a tower
of strength, and smiled. Also he spoke : “Then all I can
say is, if you are so soon out-voted in your Cabinet, God
help you, that’s all.” Then he went out and got into his
old Panhard car, and there is still a vacancy on the
Supreme Court Bench of Queensland.
WHEN THE STORM BURSTS : CUTTING
THE PAINTER.
Australia should be contented to pay its subsidy and
depend on the British navy for safety. Proposals tea
Iona! fleet are merely indications of a pernicious desire to
out the painter. —A frequent Anti-Australian wait.
THE SON: “Hr! What about me? Didn't I

Sir John’ Wil-
liams, Benn, of the
London County
Council, is a phil-
anthropist who has
gone off the rails.
The Council want-
ed a certain quan-
tity of metals for
its Socialistic
trams to run on.
A Belgian firm
offered to supply
the material and
take £21,000 out
of England ; an
English firm at
Leeds offered to
supply the materi-
al and keep £24,000
in England.
Whereupon, Si r
John Williams
Benn--whose edu-
cation seems to
have stopped short
at simple subtrac-
tion arose and
moved that the
tender of the Bel-
gian firm be ac-
cepted so that rh'e
£3OOO saved by
sending £21,000
out of the country
could be distri-
buted amongst the
unemployed in ex-
change for work
on tramway ex-
tensions. The
Council rejected
Bonn’s amendment and thereby gave the
Englishman both the work and the £24,000.
The well-meaning but foolish Benn wanted
to take £24,000 out of his countrymen’s
pockets, return them £3OOO in poor relief
works, and send the rest (£21,000) across the
sea into Belgium. Simple subtraction will be
the ruin of Benn if he isn’t careful.
Since the Bent-Irvine Government was
formed in 1902, a marvellous number of men have
dropped out. Those who are gone are Irvine,
Shiels, Reid, Sachse, Taverner, McKenzie,
Cameron, Murray, Pitt, Kirton, Gillott, Swin-
burne, Langdon, Peacock and MacKinnon. But
Bent remains hanging desperately to his job and
salary, like a female figure of Hope clutching a
bottle of hair-restorer on a half-tide rock.
Senator Sledger, of Queensland, announced
in the House of Reps, that he was opposed to a
capital on Monaro (296 miles from Sydney) on the
ground that it was wholly contrary to the secret
agreement of the State Premiers that the capital
should be at “a reasonable distance” from that city.
He added that he was going to propose and vote
for Armidale (359 miles from Sydney, but up
against the border of his own State). A curious
logician is Anthony James Joseph Sledger.

Melbourne Item.
The hearse is waiting at the door—
I see its nodding plutnes ;
The coffin’s ready on the floor,
And in the darkened rooms
The mourners sad each other bore
With talk of death and tombs.
The hearse is waiting patiently
For its pale, silent fare ;
And dingy undertakers three
Return the crowd’s fierce stare—
The crowd that always waits to see
The coffin take the air.
The hearse is waiting—waiting still
For all the world to see,
Like Death’s collector with Death’s bill
Against Humanity;
' But still no corse is brought to fill
Its murky vacancy.
The hearse is waiting doggedly,
For it has called before
To carry to Eternity
The casket on the floor.
This time it will not shifted be
By promises galore.
The grave is dug—the crape is bought—
The white blooms wilt and fade ;
The mourners hold their doleful court
In rusty black arrayed,
And ev’rywhere the reason’s sought
Why it is thus delayed.
Before a stricken House there stands
Death’s own dark chariot,
To carry to the Silent Lands
The Ministry that’s not
Willing to fold its fumbling hands
And seek its small grass plot.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, November 3, 1908.
My Dear Arini.—
“ My profession,” says the down-at-heels
Bretherton nightly, at Sydney Royal, “ is
that of a cab-chaser.” How many people, one
wonders, in a Sydney audience understand what
he means ? The cab-chaser is unknown in these
parts. In fact, he does not exist anywhere on
earth save in the United Kingdom. His is one of
the industries that have sprung up there under
Freetrade. At whatever London railway station
the traveller with much luggage arrives he is
met by the four-wheeled or “growler” cab and
that awful vehicle’s attendant parasite, the
“runner.” The cabman does not know the
runner, and refuses to have any verbal
truck with him. The station policeman scowls
upon him and his tattered clothes. He is a
pariah. The traveller sees his luggage lashed to
the roof of the “ growler,” clambers into the con-
veyance’s insanitary inside, and tries to forget
that such horrors as cab-runners exist to mar the
fair face of the world’s biggest city. Perchance,
during his drive, the traveller glances outside. If
he does he will see toiling after him, dog-fashion,
the “ runner.” Dodging between ’busses and
motors and carriages he comes, with a miserable
eye fixed strainedly on the beacon ahead—the
trunks which represent to him the chance of a
feed. It is nothing unusual for a cab-chaser to
track a “ growler ” from Liverpool-street
station to Bloomsbury (three or four miles), or
from Charing Gross to West Kensington (four
or five miles). Occasionally he manages
to get a short lift, unbeknown to the driver, on
the back of the vehicle he is following ; but the
first constable he passes makes haste to move him
off. The anguish upon the face of the cab-chaser
who arrives panting and broken up at the destina-
tion of a large mass of luggage, and finds that
there is (1) a man-servant on the premises
capable of unloading the caged clothing, or (2) a
licensed porter (many London squares run to
the latter) in attendance, is a depressing spec-
tacle. The “ dead-beat ” at Sydney Royal men-
tions that his day’s takings were That is, in
all likelihood, about the normal daily income of
the cab-pursuer. It has been estimated that there
are about 5000 cab-hunters in London alone.
At Bathurst last week Mr. George Leslie Piper
was married to Valerie, daughter of Mr. J. T.
Piper, of Orton Park. They are both members of
the famous Piper family that was inaugurated in
N.S.W. well over half-a-century ago by Captain
Piper, an A.D.C. to the Governor of his day.
Oldsters still talk with bated breath of the mag-
nificence of the original Piper. He had been a
guardsman and a man of fashion in London. He
brought with him to the Bathurst district a fine
and gaudy appreciation of the pageantry of life.
He paid calls, did his shopping and so forth
on the box seat of a coach-and-four. In most of
his walks abroad a carefully-trained brass band of
convict musicians strode behind him playing
martial airs. He introduced to the simple
countryfolk the pleasures of the “ Corinthians,”
and the country folk found them passing good.
Cock-fighting, racing, sparring and the like pre-
vailed on his extensive estate. He owned and
made free use of a plethoric cellar. One of the few
flies in his ointment was the fact that in the then
somewhat uncivilised state of the Bathurst.diatrict
there was no watch for him to assault. Now the
estate has been broken up, and the family of Piper
is as the sands of the seashore in the matter of
numerousness, and it is spread over all the land
adjacent to where its progenitor originally settled.
It no longer apes the London or any other fashions,
and the modern heads of it are not A.D.C.’s any
more, but industrious cocky farmers. Withal it
flourishes like unto an un-ringbarked gurntree,
and marries and gives in marriage increasingly
year by year.
The Macnamara twins were duly married last
week at St. John’s, Darlinghurst. They looked
floridly blooming in their ivory Directoire gowns.
The church glowed with Hills (Mrs. Macnamara
was a Hill), and with people who looked as
though they ought to be called Hill if they weren’t.
One twin spends her honeymoon at National
Park, and the other flees to Colombo aboard the
weirdly-named N.D.L. liner Seidlitz. As was
predicted in this column a while back, the grooms
participating in the above ceremony were named
respectively Mair and Krcrouse.
Sydney society in general, and local Judaism
in particular, have achieved a brace of new mem-
bers in Mr. and Mrs. Ackman, late of Melbourne.
The Ackmans are thoroughgoing Jews in every
respect but one —they aren’t going to live at Potts’
Point. Their home will be “Minma,” Double
Bay. They are generous folk, as Jews mostly
are —the tale to the contrary being one of the
conventional lies of our civilisation —and good
democrats, as Jews mostly are; and Melbourne
sent them away with deep regrets and consider-
able presents of jdate.
With Mr. Bruce Smith’s recently bestowed
tribute (viz., “ Women possess acuter minds than
men”) gratefully warming the grey matter beneath
my new race hat, I turned up at the Town Hall
to hear the question of woman’s inhumanity to
fowls discussed. Mr. Rothery, of the S.P.C.A.,
started the argument with a lecture on “ The
Destruction of Birds,” and the leading lights
of the National Council of Women continued it.
As always, when I listen to women debating,
a dull, dissatisfied feeling smote me, and a
presentiment of something futile about to be said
haunted me. The type of lady who belongs
to Councils and Leagues, and is reported in the
daily papers, is a poor public argufier. She is
illogical; she appears to leave the acute portion of
her mind, which Mr. Smith commends, at home
or at the nearest bargain sale. Mrs. Molyneux
Parkes reasoned that the men were solely to
blame for the amount of dead fowl worn by tlieir
sisters and wives. She admitted that the practice
of tearing feathers out of birds for the adornment
of human beings was infamous. “ But, ’’ she said,
“ it is the men who set the fashions in this
regard.” Women, in their child-like innocence,
“bought the feathers without a thought of any-
thing but their beauty.” It was only the men
who knew where the gladsome things came from.
The fact that the feathers were originally the
property of dear little birds who were hurt when
their property was removed was concealed from
womenkind. And so forth. Mrs. Parkes wound
up by. promising, amid cheers, that as
soon as “ she had worn out the feathers
she at present possessed” she would be
glad to join a league to prevent other people
wearing feathers. Miss Rose Scott followed the
same line of argument. “Men controlled the
fashions,” she said, and owned the shops where
they were set. Why didn’t the cruel wretches
sell the women featherless hats? (Loud ap-
plause.) The gist of her argument seemed to be
that the male fashion-leaders in the women’s head-
gear line ought to inaugurate something in the
untrimmed Glengarry cap style for everyday
usage by smart females, and an unfeathered plug
or bell-topper for garden parties and afternoon
“at homes.” Missßawson took about the sanest
view of the matter. Deftly side-stepping all
assault upon poor old battered Man, she owned
frankly that for some time she didn’t know that
ospreys were commandeered from egrets in a
cruel fashion. Since learning of the egrets’
worries she had dropped osprey-wearing. At the
local ostrich farm, which she frequented, they did
not pull, but cut, the feathers from the birds;
hence she wore Australian-grown plumes without
a qualm, and meant to continue doing so. Her
effort was one of the few bright ,spots in a flat,
unprofitable 100-acre paddock of verbiage.
“ Lantana ” sends me this letter: —
Mrs. Prendergast’s fiancd, mentioned in the “ Woman’s
Letter” (B. 15/10/’08), was a brother-in-law of the late
Patrick Jennings—or, to be strictly accurate, of Patrick’s
wife. He labored under the painfully embarrassing nick-
name of “ Handsome Reginald.” He is averred to have
been specially imported by his brother, the late Arch-
bishop Vaughan (then of St. Mary’s Cathedral, Sydney),
to marry old Squatter Shanahan’s well-dowered daughter.
The event took place at St. Mary’s, and for style and pomp
it defeated in the commonest of canters anything of
the kind that had occurred previously in R.O. circles.
After a short sojourn here, Reginald and his bride sailed
for England, and took up their abode beneath the Vaughan
roof-tree. Thesaid roof-tree is somewhere in Hertfordshire,
and tradition says that the Vaughan family has lived and
flourished under it since Adam was a mere lad. Reginald
Vaughan is the only member of the late Colonel
Vaughan’s large family (Colonel Vaughan, by the way,
was also twice married) who has not become a “re-
ligious.” Father Bernard Vaughan, the well-known
Smiter of the Smart Set, is a brother, while Herbert, the
late Cardinal of Westminster, was another brother. All
the sisters are nuns.
There died, a little while ago, at her residence,
landra, Morris-street, Summer Hill, the widow of
the once well-known Dr. Belisario, who was in
practice in this city in the early ’4o’s and wound
up, in 1879, in Lyons Terrace, Liverpool-street.
She was a daughter of Dr. Ramsay, of Dobroyd
(which used to be called Ramsay’s Bush), and a
grand-daughter of Simeon Lord, of Maequarie-
place and Botany. Dobroyd, which covered
about 600 acres of land, was Miss Lord’s wedding
portion. They handed out land in a large, free,
generous way in those early, whirly days. No-
body gets a whole suburb as a wedding-gift in the
present lean times.
Miss Clarice Sandford, daughter of Ironmaster
William Sandford, is a young art student who is
doing good work. At the recent Society of
Artists show a small oil painting of herself, by
herself, had the little red “bull’s eye,” which in-
dicates “sold,” attached to it, the purchaser
being a man who knows something about things
artistic. Miss Sandford is pretty, with curly
brown hair, and is deeply interested in her work.
A well-known official of the Fatherland Steam-
ship Company, Mr. Edouard Weyhausen, which
name the initiated pronounce something like a
new brand of hose, has asked Miss Ethel
Knyvett, daughter of squatter Knyvett, of Ewen-
mar, to be his very own, and she has remarked
that she will on the 19th of this month of the Cup.
Following closely upon the death of Nicholas
Fitzgerald, M.L.C., of Victoria, comes news by
cable of the marriage of his niece, the widow of
Robert Prendergast, brewer, of Merioola, Edge-
cliff e-road, Woollahra. Her second venture is
Reginald Vaughan, of Abergavenny, which sounds
as if it were in Wales. The bride’s father was
one of the founders of Castlemaine Ale.
Mr. “Bertie” Kelly has fled away on a health
and exploration trip to Japan. His wife did not
accompany him, the land of bad food and worse
drains being notoriously no place for three small
Australian children. The big Double Bay house
is to be shut up, and Mrs. Kelly and her offspring
will vegetate in the depths of the country till the
return of the lord and master.
Sydney is to have a Musical Festival next year.
This was settled two or three Wednesdays ago,
when a well-arranged meeting brought together a
crowd of people of “ the right sort.” The gaud
Mayor sat in the seat of the mighty, and the
audience included Minister Hogue, Wise, K.C. ;
Mr. Holman, Judge Heydon, and many bright
lights of the commercial and musical world.
Speeches were limited to a few minutes each, and
a lightning change of chairman, which brought
Heydon and Wise to the front in rapid succession,
made things as brisk as a Tivoli turn. A strong
committee was appointed, and it has elaborated a
scheme. Also over £5OO has been guaranteed.
Miss Ivy Salvin, the absorbing young English-
woman who has been deserted, has collected
damages from the deserter, has gone on the
Sydney stage, and has acquired a new male wor-
shipper all within a period so brief as to constitute
in all likelihood a world’s record, is not going to
retire to a Victorian horse-farm just yet, as has
been stated. She has accepted a part in “She
Stoops to Conquer,” at Melbourne Royal.
Various and contradictory rumors are hurtling
around as to her marriage. It was con-
fidently asserted in some quarters that she
was espoused to “the son of a distinguished
N.S.W. statesman ” last Friday. Others aver
that the statesman’s proud soul recoils at the idea
that a child of his should marry into the “pro-
fesh,” and that he has threatened that within
five minutes or less after the ceremony he will
transform himself into a heavy parent of melo-
drama and cut the wilful boy off without a bean.
The worshipper—if rumor has got hold of the
right worshipper—has a small income of his own
that no progenitor, however maddened, may
touch. Withal, the paternal fury is understood to
have made him think some. He is doing the
thinking in Melbourne at present. These state-
ments, of course, are based on the rumor that the
marriage hasn’t come off. If the true rumor is the
one to the effect that the marriage has come off,
then he is still thinking in Melbourne —either he
or somebody that rumor has mistaken for him.
The trio whose names are reminiscent of whisky
gave three more concerts at the Town Hall during
last week, and had fair houses. On Thursday,
Leo, the violinist of the troupe, who is like unto
Gecko in “Trilby,” created a diversion by snap-
ping his violin string during the performance of
the “ Otello Fantasie,” and had to be beached
for repairs. To while away the interval while Leo
was away being half-soled, his pianist brother
executed some “ twiddly bits” pianissimo. Jan,
whose manner savors too much of affectation, was
at his best in a “Polonaise in A Flat,” by
Chopin; while baby Mischel gave two ’cello
solos on his own, concluding with quite a
professional toss of his plenteous forelock
and three little nods in acknowledgment of
applause. Incidentally there were trios by Bee-
thoven and an arrangement of a Hebrew melody,
“Kol Nidrei,” by Abraham Cherniavski —pre-
sumably the parent of the stars. Mrs. Marie
Hooton, funereally garbed in unrelieved black,
threw in an old Devonshire song about a couple
who loved and wed and brought up 33 farmerlings
to help them thresh the barley. Also, Percival
Driver sang to us of “ Little Molly Mary,” aged
six—no relation to the lady of a similar name who
recently toured these parts.
Marie Studholme, the musical comedy actress,
whose amazing teeth gleam from a thousand post-
cards wherever the British flag waves, and in a
good many places where it doesn’t, has been mar-
ried. The event took place last month. _ Her
spouse is chiefly distinguished in that he is the
son of General Borrett, C. 8., who did deeds of
valor during the Abyssinian expedition, 40 years
ago. The bride describes herself on the marriage
register as
Caroline Mary Porteous, formerly Lupton, spinster,
aged 31, the divorced wife of Gilbert James Porteous, of
38 Finehley-road, daughter of Joseph Lupton, of inde-
pendent means.
As to the “ aged 31 ” item, it is not inconceivable
that a clerical error has crept in, or that the person
who supplied the statistics has made a miscalcula-
tion. Male folks who are now bald boast that
they fell blitheringly in love with the Studholme
smile when they (to wit, the males) were callow
lads, and have been repeating the foolish trick off
and on for 20 years since then.
Nat Goodwin, the red-headed American actor
who starred here a while back, and Maxine Elliot,
his wife, have had the burst-up that appears in-
evitable when two front-rank mimes wed.
Nathaniel filed papers in a divorce action against
Miss Elliot at Reno, Nevada (U.S.A.), last
month. For a decade or more Maxine Elliot has
been held by many to be the loveliest woman on
the English-speaking stage. Nat is small, bald,
“ ’ornery” looking—so much so that one’s sense of
the fitness of things is inclined to rise in revolt
somewhat at his audacity in essaying to cut loose
from his gorgeous partner. But in these matters
men will not look at things in the right and
seemly light.
Sophie Osmond, the ex-Melbourne presswoman,
who has been making good in London for some
years, writes to me of a Sydney singer:—
Eva O’Connor, the Sydney contralto, has begun her
career in England by making a conquest of Ireland.
Three times this year has she crossed the Irish Channel
to appear in patriotic junketings in Dublin, such as the
Gaelic Parliament, National Congress, Brian Boru and
Killarney celebrations. At one of these the Countess of
Aberdeen complimented the Australian singer, but fell
into the error of mistaking her for a daughter of Erin.
E. O’O. quickly proclaimed her nationality, an incident
that led to the vice-regal lady making a particular selec-
tion of a song, “She is Far from the Land,” which
evoked still more praise. In November Eva O’O. will
assist at the Dublin Oratorio Society’s Concerts (with
Amy Castles as soprano). The whole record forms an
excellent pay-sheet, and one that is very unusual in the
first year’s fight in London. Eva O’Connor has, however,
two wonderful attributes besides her voice—immense
physical strength, and a capacity for hard work.
Another London Gaiety actress has married
money, and she and her spouse are coming to
these "parts on their honeymoon. Her name is
Enid Leonhardt, and his is David Wellesley Bell.
She was in the habit of raking in weekly an ex-
tensive wad of coin as leading lady in “ Havana,”
the latest Gaiety success ; her encumbrance rakes
in more in the r6le of son of a merchant-father
deceased. The visiting bride is a more or less
bosom friend of the Delia Mason lady, who was
out here a year or so back, and is expected in con-
sequence to arrive with a trunkful of recommen-
dations to our harbor-side noblesse.

I suppose it is merely some harmless he-person
who wants to hire hash on the usual terms, but it
reads quaintly.
“Mario” writes from Brisbane :
When you come up this way, and somebody asks you
to drop in and have an ice-cream, tell the somebody that
it’s really no use-—you haven’t made a will in his favor (or
hers, as the gender may be). Then he (or she) will pro-
bably suggest something else. Forty-one samples of ice-
cream were collected in North Brisbane last pneumonia-
blouse season, and C. J. Pound, the roan who hunts our
microbes for us, put the catch through his drafting yards.
“ Many,” he remarks in a report just published, “ were
found to be grossly contaminated with bacteria, while
several contained numbers of coli bacilli,” and coli bacilli
are understood to be the little beasts that give you
typhoid and other bad habits. So now we aren t eating"
any strange ice-cream unless we boil it first.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 2, 1908.
My Dear Yarrie.—
The final fling—the last bang-crash of the tom-
toms of the Medical Festival —was the Wrixons’
crush at State Parliament House on Monday.
The first item of entertainment was a cinemato-
graph in the Queen’s Hall, so that the people
who were not punctual to the eight-o’-clock
moment for the reception stumbled from outer
darkness to inner darkness, and grabbed in a
ghostly way round a seething mass of shoulders,
and gazed wonderingly at Dutch canals and things
that burst out of the gloom, and waited for light—
more light. The hostessing Wrixon lady was
dazzling in diamonds and a dress that was black
and gold and blue, and her distinguished-
looking Henry-husband showed up in court dress.
Governor Carmichael was with them in his usual
rather saggy dress suit. Lady Carmichael wore
sinuous glistening black, and her rubies—oh those
rubies ! wicked, winking eyes of maddening color
—and a few diamonds sprinkled about as a back-
ground. Mrs. Rev. Smith Mcßain, the Wrixons’
bride daughter, was demure and white in her
bridal gown. The tired-looking Madden lady
lit up her black toggery with a shriek of turquoise
and pearl and diamond. The other Madden dame
was assertive in black and her own vigorous red
hair. Mrs. Weedon, who is fading out of the
Mayoral sunshine, always looks hustled. She
wore her Aldermanic-presentation diamond tiara
and a few other things.
All the visiting medicoes were in the crowd,
and all the early race people. Dr. Bourne,
a very young lady, came with Mr. and Mrs.
Howard Connell. She has been much in evidence
at the business end of the congress ; she has not
otilymany degrees, but also aflourishing practice in
Brisbane, where she dashes round in a tigered
dogcart and an air of capability. Miss Dr. .Johns
was another Bananalander. Medico Hamilton, a
striking-looking man from Adelaide, has had a
pretty, golden-haired daughter at all the playings,
and Dr. Davenport’s 17-year-old girleen grew up
into her first long blue siik dress for this occasion
specially. Great big O’Hara brought a few of his
quiverful of pretty daughters. They have a jolly
time, these girls, when they “ go out with Dad.”
Mrs. Keating, with her tall, curled senator,
whose hair is like the forelock of a bull of Bashan
or the beard of an Assyrian archer, glowed like a
rose in a pink frock ; and Donald Mackinnon’s
dame, of majestic mien, wore a purple and white
brocade that defied the crush and spread
itself superbly. Mrs. Edward Miller, another
duchess dame, flaunted white and silver.
Maggie Stirling made a great big Butt-like pro-
gression. She was swathed and decorated in pale
blue. The Senator Simon Fraser girls were
peaches. They were clothed in pale gauze and
silver tissue, with gleams of soft lace and pearls to
deck them. President Maudsley’s wife wore a
handsome black empire gown. Mrs. Fisken
blazed with cherry color in her hair and a
crystallised white tulle frock. Two turtle doves,
who determined to escape the shouting throng,
took refuge in the Council Chamber of the
Mighty, and were discovered in the Speaker’s
chair.

Were nested there together.
The Dhdley lady is being boomed, saluted and
welcomed as if she were an old favorite. That
comes of sending a nice, popular husband on
ahead to break the ice or fracture the frozen sub-
stance. The lady stepped off the boat on a
howling north-wind day, looking cool and dainty
in a white linen dress, with a cute little coat to it.
The hat was wreathed in the cold paleness of
camellias showing white against their dark-green
leaves, like a polar bear in a gumtree. That was
just a glimpse. Then the welcomed one was
whipped into a new motor and taken away to keep
cool.
At the Naval'and Military Ball all the Governor
element we possess was on a scarlet dais with a
cool wilderness of palm and shrub behind and a
blaze of scarlet azalea in the middle distance.
Scarlet pennons shouted all down the balconies,
and a lurid light descended from scarlet and
green chandeliers on high. The orchestra
wrs carefully hidden behind a scarlet screen
in the far balcony. The new countess blazed
with diamonds. They fell in ropes round
her, and clasped her neck in the thick magnificent
throttle of a baby boa-constrictor. Otherwise the
lady was clad with the veriest simplicity in a
sheath of silvery shimmering gauze that embraced
rosy-mauve silk. Inside the circle of tiara, to
accent the parting of very dark hair, she wore
combs of rose opals—big rose opals that blinked
with opulence and shone in harmony with her
gown. Her figure, slight and lithe, is very
charming, and, in the words of Suburbia, she is
“ haffability hitself.” She poured out affability
with a recklessness somewhat out of drawing with
the haughty type of her face. A bird face, sharp
featured, well-modelled, and lighted with eagle
eyes that could look daggers if called for. The
Carmichael lady smiled pleasantly alongside.
Her Chantilly lace gown was decked with real
water lilies and her hands were full of the
scented simple flower. The well-groomed
spruceness of the G.-G. showed up the
rather genial sagginess of the Carmichael’s
“ bags.” Carmichael needs to buck up sartorially.
Miss Wisdom, a visiting attachment to the G.-G.
household, was a rigid pole in blue. These sheath
dresses have much to answer for. The under pre-
paration must be a ihomentous matter to maids.
There is another satellite lady at court. One calls
her Mrs. Rivven, which is the English way of
getting out of saying “Ruthven.” She is wife to
Aide Haw-Ruthven (or is it Hore-Ruth ven ?).
The amazing thing about this N. and M. Ball
was that there were practically no naval men
there, and the military men were conspicuous by
their gold-laced fewness. Somehow the ball
did not end like an ordinary frisk—it suddenly
fizzled out and left a froth of chatting, supper-
lapping, middle-aged people. The youth and
beauty and frivol fled at the earliest moment to a
couple of big dances at private houses. The
Lachlan Mackinnons had a most elevated and im-
perial ball that night, which helps to explain the
scarcity of men in gaudy splendor.
At the ball I saw Miss Eileen Anglin in the
glory of her copper hair and some filmy draperies.
She is not playing in “ The Thief,” which took
the company to Adelaide. Sydney Mayor
Hughes brought his wife in a lovely rose-colored
gown, and Miss Ola Humphrey was with them.
Her red hair was piled up softly, and she had a
dress like a sunset. Mrs. Tom Hogan was notable
for her golden slippers which were amazingly
small for so big a woman.
Derby Day was a day to bring out butterflies—
no flaw in the still, cool blueness of it, nothing to
rumple the most cherished frock. The big hat,
except in an odd few outrageous instances, has
been modified from a screaming, top-heavy bird
with horrible wings and tail outspread, to a big,
comfortably-fitting shade in a sunny land. It is
made mostly of light-weight straw and lacy
fixings, and curves round the face with the
effect and shadow of a pretty parasol.
One of the horrific exceptions was the headgear of
an artist’s wife. All day the poor woman carried
on her head the curse of a flapping winged thing,
like a condor that had just eaten a horse in the
higher Andes. The prettiest hat was the bonnety
gear of the newest Governor lady. Her frock was
white, and so were all the ruffly-fluffy additions.
Her hat, a huge thing of creamy straw, was bent
intoa fascinating poke, and the wholecircumstance,
soft, dreamy plumes and all, was netted in neatly
with a fine veil. Hat and tulle neck ruff together
gave a quaint Pierrette effect.
The Carmichael lady beamed softly in dull
greenery-blue—the blue of a peacock—and Miss
Wisdom was tall and stately—as Wisdom should
be—in blue. The Forrest dame had quite a
quiet frock—a charming thing all ivory and
lace. Mrs. Senator Keating’s toggery was racily
smart —a tailored linen of Tuscan shade with black
fixings. Ada Crosslev, with husband Dr. Muecke,
wandered about looking like a restful cool vista of
trees and grass. Her frock was soft grass-green—
a dull crepy thing, with a gliding snaky tail that
showed a shot-blue lining in its writhmgs over the
lawn. Her shoes were grass green, and her hat a
big, soft, white shelter. Mrs. Mayoral Hughes
wore a dream of a gown that would take half a
column to describe.
There is quite a honeymooney flutter among the
pretty Mia-Mia girls, and much matrimonial en-
gagement is upsetting the even tenor of their
ways. One damsel has gone off honeymooning
with her wealthy Geelong lord, and now Miss
Burberry, a vivacious little brunette, is to marry
Harry Allen, a scion of the Flinders-lane house
of Richard Allen.
Jean Langtree, one of our Tooralc beauty girls,
who belongs also to a woolly station clan in your
State, has promised to marry one of the Deniliquin
Landales on a fairly-adjacent date.
By the Bremen the Busst family returns for a
visit to Melbourne. Which is calculated to make
a lot of people feel somewhat middle-aged. Only
the other year, Aylmer and Victor Busst were
pampered musical prodigies, who used to be kissed
for their music. Now Aylmer returns with a wife.
The Mayoress of Hawthorn announces a mild
festivity for the dull week that cometh after the
Cup. She is to hold a reception at the local
Town Hall on Wednesday afternoon.
Ola Humphrey got a warm welcome at Her
Majesty’s on Saturday night. There are fresh
frocks in “ The Scarlet Pimpernel.” The old lot
were shed, and the new bloomed on Saturday
night, but they are not duplicates of the
cast-off glories, save in the matter of period.
Miss Ola H.’s travelling frock is a luscious brown
silk polonaise over a skirt of golden toast brown.
A fichu of finest lawn, edged with lace, and a bor-
dering of brown fur are details that harmonise
with the big violet hat. Her ball gown—the
gown in which she treads a measure with the
Prince Regent—is a complicated and lavish
achievement consisting of a gold-colored satin
underskirt; then a pink chiffon skirt; thirdly, a
gold-spangled chiffon overdress ; and finally and
fourthly, a jewelled robe. Mother-of-pearl fish-
scale and gold spangles run to chromatic madness
all over it, whilst pink, blue and mauve margue-
rites are embroidered in raised silk. The Court
train is gold tissue over vivid crimson satin. The
garden scene dress is a broclie, with sapphire
blue tulips. The big hat is of white and sapphire
blue, with gold tassels finishing the strings.
Dainty Unie Russell, who had to nurse her sick
mater in London almost as soon as they ar-
rived there, was lately conducting the con-
valescent around the United Kingdom of Ned,
with Paris in view. From Glasgow she writes a
newsy letter :
T went with Mrs. 6. B. Lewis to a reception given by
the Victorians in London to the Gibson-Carmichael Ex-
cellency at the Trocadero, and was amazed to meet dozens
of people I knew. Alice Crawford was there, more ma-
tured and thinner, I think. She looked tired after h r
heavy season as Glory Quayle in “ The Christian,” and was
resting at Mrs. Taverner’s before going back to work as
Forbes Robertson’s leading lady in “The Third Floor
Back.” Joseph Gillott was also there, and very imposing
was the white-haired Joseph’s appearance. You heard of
Violet Mount's success as “ L’ Incognita ” at the Alhambra.
Her wonderful high notes roused the English public to
the pitch of enthusiasm. At present she is touring at
double salary—£Bo a week.
This last item of information, by the way, seems
rather cablegrammic in tone. Another informant
who heard “ L’lncognita ” sing at the Alham-
bra, without suspecting that the masked warbler
was Violet Mount, failed to notice anything
remarkable in the turn, or in the applause
at the end of it. To get on with the letter :
Charles Rose had a three-months’touring engagement
as Prince Danilo in “The Merry Widow,” and has done
nothing since. I see by Glasgow posters that Edward
Lauri and May Beattie are “sketching” at one of the
music halls. Yesterday afternoon we saw Mrs. Brown
Potter as Lady Frederick. She was really effective in the
second act and humorous in the last —in fact, the per-
formance was a fairly successful copy of Ethel Irving,
with Mrs. Potter’s mannerisms. Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis has
resumed her old stage (and family) name of Miss Rose
Edouin, and is playing Miss Pyechase in “ The Dairy-
maids” with Mr. Courtneidge’s company. We went to
hear Father Vaughan preach. He is more startling than
convincing. He draws crowds of fashionable women who
seem to enjoy the lash of his tongue. It doesn’t diminish
the size of their hats. If I had not wanted to hear Father
Vaughan I might have gone to sleep under the shade of
my neighbor’s hat. As for seeing him—it was out of the
question.
The rest of the letter deals with the exceeding
awfulness of the Sawbath in Glasgow.
From “ Rosna,” who melts in Adelaide:—
Victoria Park was an unpremeditated rose-show on the
occasion 8f the Mayoral garden jollity on October 24.
Such a riot of blooms you never saw, concealing the
whole side of the moderately-grand stand, and tum-
bling over every arch. The weather was also heavenly, •
and only to be spoken of to slow music. A big Jap um-
brella in a bower of palms sheltered Mr. Johnson and Mrs.
Mayfield, while they received the bows of the 3 miles 40
poles 417 ft. of guests. There was one marquee, wearing
the delectable label, “ Ices,” and there were sundry tea-
tents and a band to drown the groans of the injured who
were torn in the rush to the ice-house The hostess wore
black and white glacb with Asiatic-looking embroidery in
blue and gold, and Miss Mayfield was a dainty pale-blue
and Honiton lace maiden, with a shimmery pink and white
hat. Lady Le Hunte came in cool white summery silk,
and Miss Clowes wore a striped black and white raiment
with a rose hat. Olive Godwin was there in black, and
a long coat and large millinery. All officialdom was also
there, except the Premier and Mrs. Price, who had taken
their brethren of the Welsh Choir a-sailing on the Outer
. Harbor. The Premier is justly proud of his little harbor,
and takes frequent parties to view its charms, in a firm
endeavor to put Sydney’s tip-tilted nose out of joint.
The Richard Nitchskes, back home for a rest from the
toil of entertaining English society, had a large “at
home ” at the Colton Hall on October 26, whereat they
collected their old friends and shook them by the hand.
There was afternoon tea at 5.30, and, in between, music
by all our sweetest makers of that substance—Nora
Kyffln Thomas and her fiddle, and Elsie Hamilton and
her piano, and Wanborough Fisher and Mr. Nitchske
with their warbles, arid Clara Kleinschmidt with her
sensation voice. As for the room, it was roses, roses all
the way, and where there weren’t roses there were frocks.
Mrs. Nitchske wore fawn ninon over vieux rose silk, one of
the new large Queen Elizabeth ruffs, and abe-plumed hat.
Beauteous Mrs. Evan Kyffin Thomas was charming, as
she always is, in a raiment of embroidered cream, with
a big blue-and-white hat. There were two Muecke
maidens, one in black silk and the other in soft white and
heliotrope.
The Albion Tolleys, who were to have further decked
their already lovely garden with frills and folk the next
day, had to postpone the function, owing to the death
of a relative.
Adelaide (or all of it that hasn’t gone a-Cupping) is
determined to spend its last, lone boblet over Margaret
Anglin ; and Hindley-street is blocked every night by
Mrs. Hyphen Dash’s carriage and Mrs. Plush-Blank’s
motor brougham, as only “ Merry Widow ” Carrie had
been able to block it. On Monday eve of last week the
whole of the circle was grasped by the Military Club, and
S. A. was left entirely undefended until after supper-time.
The Portuguese might have landed and annexed the place
at any moment.
For the Rose Show on Thursday the temperature had
the energy to get up to 100° and frizzle everyone to growl-
ing point. Still, as far as the blooms were concerned, it
was a joyous day, for Adelaide has not had such a rose
season since 1 was born, and that’s 17 years ago. His
Excellency got in somehow and opened the thing from
the inside, with Lady Le Hunte and Miss Clowes to help
him, and a frilly crowd looked on and said, “ Hear, hear ”
in the wrong places. The first prize for a decorated
dinner table went to one of the inevitable Ind family, who
used pale pink poppies ; and Miss Loutit and a little Hall
girl captured the other guerdons.
Muriel Matters, the Adelaide suffragetting girl men-
tioned last week, has gone and got arrested at last, and
now she’ll probably be quite happy. Chained and pad-
locked up in the women’s gallery, she recited at the
House of Commons ; and, although she has always been
supposed to recite rather well, the Commons don’t appear
to have appreciated her efforts, and she was carried off to
a dark dungeon for disturbing their sleep. There was
another woman in it, too, but her efforts to be arrested
were unsuccessful, from which we may conclude that our
own fair Muriel was ringleader.
Something new in bed reats, which won a first
prize and a “ special ” at the Vie. Women’s Work
Exhibition, has been patented throughout Aus-
tralia, and put on the invalid market by agents in
Melbourne and Sydney. It is the invention of
one Nurse Greaves, of Melbourne. A light iron
framework, easy of adjustment, it props the back
of the patient at an angle of 45 or thereabouts, and
rests the weary lower limbs, after the manner of a
billowy deck chair. A picture of it, fixed in posi-
tion. under the mattress and pillows, almost
tempts one to be “laid up.”
Regarding the Garcoar (N.S.W.) “wild and
hairy man,” who died recently, and who
claimed to be a member of the Duke of Leinster’s
family, it may interest you to know that we have
another relative of the Duke in this State. His
name is Lord Charles Fitzgerald. He is 48 years
old and married. He inhabits a modest tenement
with a low iron roof on a small allotment in the
vicinity of the little hamlet known as Riddell's
Creek. The name of his dwelling place is
Fernlea Villa. His ducal relative sends him aregu-
lar allowance (some £4OO a year), the which is re-
mitted to Melbourne quarterly and there collected
by his lordship’s wife. All accounts in connection
with the education of the young lordlings or
dukelings, or whatever they are, are sent Fog-
wards and there defrayed. It is alleged that his
first oversea venture was when, prior to coming to
Australia, he managed to wade through an item
of £ll,OOO or so in connection with an Indian tea
plantation on which the family tree established him.
On first landing in these parts he was employed
as a “ temporary ” clerk by the Victorian Educa-
tion Department. In the dim past he was a Lieu-
tenant in the 3rd Battalion of the .Royal Dublin
Fusiliers, which is a Militia Regiment.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
One Withers loomed up largely in Sydney
last week. He is the rock-chopping person who
has closed up the whole rock-chopping business
by quarrelling with his union. By reason of the
quarrel there is a big strike, and Premier Wade’s
Industrial Disputes Act is attempting to settle it
by fining the union. Now Withers announces
that he too is on strike. This announcement seems
to have staggered Wade. He thought there was
this one rock-chopper anyway on whom he could
rely, and his last rock-chopper has gone back on
him.
“Platman,” on the question of State en-
dowments to Queensland shires (B. l/10/’08) :
Undoubtedly the endowment system was worked for all
it was worth in its early days ; nevertheless a good deal
of the £'3,000,000 went to make roads’to and through
# State lands, thereby increasing their value—an increase
which the Government got when it auctioned off so many
thousands of acres. The other extreme has now been
reached, and in spite of Mr. Airey, there are several shires
in Queensland, and particularly in the Far North, that
deserve further consideration. For instance, the Walsh
shire, with an area of 4000 square miles, contains some
of the roughest country in Australia. How is it possible
for its sparse and scattered population to make and main-
tain main roads? To-day, as 25 or 30 years ago, the pack
team is the only means of conveyance between many of
the mining camps. Same remarks apply to Woothakata,
which embraces the Hodgkinson, the O.K. (100 miles
west), and Mount Molloy (40 miles east). Again, in the
Tinaroo shire, which includes the Evelyn scrub, the
Atherton scrub, and the .Johnstone River scrub, the
Government is throwing open land for settlement; but
the settlers are already disheartened by the fact that
they are practically isolated in wet weather—and there
is a lot of wet weather in those places.

’Ta/Te EDISON
PHONOGRAPH
Youno' folk often wander away from the home circle m search
of music and entertainment. Yet it is so easy to entertain them at
home better than they can be entertained anywhere else.
By means of an Edison Phonograph, which gives all the new
popular songs of the theatre, and selections from the grand operas an
concerts, you can keep the young people at home without any
difficulty. It
Furnishes Music of all KindSi
It reproduces band music, the old ballads, and lore songs so
perfectly that it is hard to believe it is not the actual music or
voice to which you are listening. Parents owe it t 0 thelr ohl
to investigate the merits of the Edison Phonograph, and should
not confound it with any other kind of talking-machine they
may have heard.
Write to ns for full lists of machines and records and the
name of your nearest dealer. He will willingly let you hear an Edison
model. You can always be sure it’s the genuine article by seeing . .
Edison’s signature on the machine or record as a trade-mark.

“ Melb.” : Re the late W. V. Robinson. Melbourne
Argus found a necessity for importing' reporters in the
goldfields era. Local men were apt to be hogsheady.
Aspinall and Smyth were got from England, with the
bitter mistake of obtaining barristers, who, like that
other reporter, Higinbotham, quickly ran to brief. The
next important import was Robinson, from Leeds, m
1861. Then Jeans and Thompson were brought trom
England. In 1866 the establishment of Hansard skinned
the Argus of the cream of its staff, in Robinson, Wil-
loughby, and Hadley, at the munificent screw of £lO a
week each. There was not such a good trio of Parlia-
mentary reporters associated south of the line, and vvu-
loughbv was, of course, very much more than a mere
reporter. Apparently they only received £6 a week each
on the Argus. Willoughby blossomed into a founder oi
the Daily Telegraph, and then cannoned back to the
ARGUS. Robinson became a be-wigged Assembly Clerk at
the table, with all the smartness of a Barker, Carlile, or
Dumas, and just a trifle more than a Jenkins. W. v.
always remained the Englishman. Like Macaulay in
India, or Reid in N.S.W., he changed his sky, but never
his mind. A London Radical mob shouted: ‘ There s
Tory old Lord Eldon. Cheer him. He never ratted.

Ally Sloper’s Half-Holiday, the London “comic”
weekly, has been booming itself by means of a “Mis-
quoted Sentence Competition.” The reader was given a
sentence from the classics, with a wrong' word staring
out of it in all the indecency of heavily-leaded type. Ihis
word had to be corrected. The rules were as follows
“ With each solution a sixpenny Postal Order must be
sent, and the total amount received, less 10 per cent, for
working expenses, etc., will go to the competitor who
finds the right word. If more than one competitor sendr
in the right word, the total of money received will b*
equally divided. For example: if the money received i*
£5OO, and only one competitor discovers the correct word,
the £5OO is his or hers. If five competitors succeed in
finding the right word, they would each receiye £lOO.
£5OO is, of course, purely an assumed figure, and we can
hardly hope to reach it in the first week or two.
On August 1, 1908, the paper announced the result :
“ One hundred and ninety-three competitors succeeded
in supplying the correct word.
“ The total amount to be divided among the above com-
petitors is £9 18s., and cheques will be forwarded to the
successful ones accordingly.”

“ S.T.S.” : Surely the nearest relative to the unintelli-
gent ostrich is the brand of English editor who nowa-
days buys American stories (as having more snap in
them than the local article), and then tries to make
them look English. The Strand recently gave the
place of honor for three months to a detective yarn
which shrieked its Yankee origin on every page ; but
it carefully translated “Chicago” into Birmingham
and “20 dollars ” into “ £4.” And now here is the
London with a tale by Lloyd Osbourne about a wealthy
person named Van Ingen—which combination means
New York as surely as C. A. Jeffries, writing on the
Shepherd Kings, means Maoriland. Yet Van is made
to live “in the west of London ” (which is not even an
expression that any Londoner would employ). And he
boasts incidentally of his old Dutch ancestry, the un-
titled nobility of this country ’’—natural in New York,
but pure foolishness in England. His son’s earnings are
stated in “ shillings ” ; and the clubs the son belongs to
have these fine old British names: “the Hoi and
Society,” “ the Association of the Descendants of Wolfert
Weber,” “ the Winkyn Club,” and “ the Sons of the Bur-
gomasters.” Finally, the ostrich-editor gets tired, a,nd
allows those earnings to be stated as dollars. The reader
has got tired long before.
COUNTRY NEWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIL. ]
If you are tired of life,
And would your hours amuse
To aid yourself and gather pelf,
Suh-edit “ Country News ” 1
Yes— “ sub " the “ Country News ” J
Keep out of pubs and stews ;
The beer may flow, the hansoms go
Wherever they may choose—
Sub-edit “Country News.”
The fellow-townsman’s broken leg,
The splendid yield of grain,
The price men pay for corn and hay,
The welcome fall of rain—
(Yes, mind the fall of rain,
It brings the farmers gain ;
And farmers know the district Show
By this is saved or slain,
So watch the fall of rain).
Be gentle with your pencil blue,
The scissors leave alone,
And do not “ drop ” upon a crop
By any farmer sown —
It is his ownest own ;
To read of how it’s grown
He'll buy for cash the Daily Hash,
And naught will quite atone
If Crops are never shown.
You’ll closely scan the milking tests,
The butter factory ;
You mustn’t scoff at the “ Great Send Off ”
(With speeches twenty-three)
To some obscure J.P.—
A shining light is he;
It would not do to run him through
With pencil fierce and free—
It would be blasphemy 1
The deaths of old identities,
Who lived till they were grey
At Boggy Flat, are items that
You must not cast away ;
The local M.L.A.,
The senseless kine that stray,
The Water Trust, you’ll treasure just
Like pearls of brightest ray.
(They make the paper pay !)
The “ handsome testimonial,”
The wild-cat railway line,
The New Year sports, the tinpot courts,
The “ salutary fine,”
You’ll give ’em each a line ;
Or possibly they’ll shine
Beneath cross-heads —or e’en with “leads,
If time and “space ” combine,
And if you feel benign.
Yes, things like these will pass the time
Which else you might abuse ;
For all the while you fill the file
With slabs of “ Country News,
The correspondent’s views
* (Though not of rainbow hues)
Will help you grin, though nerves wear thin
And wearied eyes refuse
To read the “ Country News
And still, in hours of drift
The best escape from blues
Is just to drive a pencil swift through piles of Country

CONSTIPATION AND LIVER
COMPLAINT.
A Well-known Grocer Praises Dr. Morse's
Indian Root Pills for His Restoration
to Health.
Mr. W. H. Jones, of 19 Rosser Street, Rozelle,
one of Balmain’s oldest residents, tells in his
letter to the Proprietors of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills how this wonderful remedy, by regulat-
ing the bowels and correcting the liver, restored
him to health and strength. With his kind per-
mission we publish his photo., together with his
letter, which is as follows :
“Some few years ago I suffered acutely from
constipation, liver complaint, and greatly impair-
ed health, and my whole system became deranged.
I tried many medicines,
but nothing was as good a
corrective as Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. They
put my bowels into perfect
working order, overcame
my liver troubles, and my
health became as well as I
could wish it. As a pur-
gative medicine I always
strongly recommend them,
and a dose occasionally
keeps me in the best of
health. I may add that
the most part of my life I
have spent in Balmain, and
for 27 years I have kept
this shop, and, therefore, I
claim to be one of the oldest residents of Rozelle,
and am, consequently, well known.”
Only one man or woman in a hundred is per-
fectly healthy. The other 99 have some digestive
trouble, and perhaps more than 50 per cent, of
these could trace their trouble to that most pre-
valent evil—constipation. It’s a simple thing of
itself, but, like many simple things, it may grow
and become complicated. Constipation is the root
of nine-tenths of the sickness of man, and a large
proportion of the sickness of women. Nature
often requires a little assistance, and if this
assistance is given at the first indication much
distress and suffering may be averted.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
It is over, and the yells and curses of punters
are drowned in the whoopings of Christian Noses, whose
bag is heavy with the loot of the biggest racing event in
Australia. Just as this issue goes to press, a bald
statement of the end of the Melbourne Cup
announces that Lord Nolan was first and Tul-
keroo and Delaware second and third in that
order. As far as this writer knows, no one
tipped the Lord as a winner, although he was men-
tioned as a wrecker who might upset the pot of the
various good things. In other words, he was grudgingly
given a possible. A good rule for tipping Cup winners
seems to be : (1) Make a list of the horses ; (2) rule out
all those that seem to have a paper chance ; (3) select a
candidate out of the hopeless ones by firing a pea rifle at
the document.
The first day of the V.R.C. meeting brought
considerable comfort and joy to the unnobility and gentry
who live by 7 the uncertainty of racing. A hot first favorite
and a decided second favorite were beaten in the Maiden
Plate, an outsider (Brookong) won the Maribyrnong Plate
(for which the N.S.W. filly, Zilka, ran poorly), the favor-
ites were beaten again in the Hotham Handicap, and the
odds of four to one laid on Mooltan were upset by Peru,
who went out at 15’s. The Derby could have done the
books little harm, considering that two of the defeated
ones were backed at two to one and four to one respect-
ively. Only the last race of the day was good for the
punters. lolaire carried a lot of money at two to one,
and won by half a head.
Local fancy favored Alawa for the Derby, and
the win was popular enough, yet it was a surprising upset
of public form. Parsee seemingly lacked the pace that
enabled Alawa to put up a record (2min. 35£sec.) for the
V.R.C. event. The Sydney 7 Derby winner beat everything
else by many lengths, hut he couldn’t make up the
distance that had separated him from the Victorian colt
in the early stages of the journey. Alawa was always
second or first in the running, the fast pace being set by
his stable-companion, Wai-Ila, for nearly a mile. Parsee,
starting on the extreme outside of the field, was never
near the front until Alawa had taken the lead from Wai-
Ila. For the last half-mile the two cracks ran about
equally fast, and Alawa, having a big advantage, kept
it to the finish. Ere Thk Bulletin is pub-
lished, the result of the Cup will have shown
whether Parsee was unwisely handled in the Derby
race, Possibly he would have been quicker to get away if
jockey Clayton had given him a “pipe-opening” burst
in the preliminary 7, but for some reason or other Parsee
was not sprinted before going to the post. In the matter
of appearance after the race there was nothing to choose
between him and the winner. He hadn’t turned a hair.
There was not a spur mark on him, or any other indica-
tion of his having been bustled, and because he looked
quite fresh and kicksome as soon as he was rubbed down,
some of his disappointed Derby backers decided to risk a
bit more on Parsee for the Cup.
The betting on the Derby had two surprising
features. Firstly, the short price taken about Alawa in
preference to Parsee, for it was only at the last moment
that the former d ropped and the latter advanced to 2 to
1. The other surprise was the backing of Monobel down
to 4 to I, as though he were a very dangerous opponent
on form. The market indicated that Monobel had
won a great trial. In the race, he showed only moderate
speed and less stamina, and on returning to the birdcage
the handsome colt seemed to have had enough of it. In
fact, if form thusfar can be trusted, Alawa and Parsee
can give a lot of weight to all the other 3-year-olds they
have met.
The public got a striking demonstration of the
occasional unfairness of the machine in the start for the
Hotham Handicap. Ranged immediately in front of the
stand, the six horses gave some trouble. The starter’s
assistant took Le Jeune by the bridle and led him to the
starting-gate, which thereupon rose at the starter’s signal.
Le Jeune, flustered by the attentions of the man in the red
coat, failed to get away with the rest. The unfortunate
gee lost fully 20 lengths, and this, in a fast-run race,
was fatal to his chance. The starter and his assistant
between them ruined the prospects of Le Jeune. It was
a rotten start. The field should have been recalled and
put back to the barrier, but on the principle that “ the
Gate can do no wrong,” the six were left to gallop away
in straggling order with Le Jeune bringing up the rear.
He made up a lot of ground and finished third—a credit-
able performance in an absolutely hopeless cause. In
such cases the handicap is not made by the official who
allots the weights to the horses but by the starter who
sends them away on ridiculously unequal terms.
Again, in the Melbourne Stakes—though here
the start seemed fairly successful —the pace was too hot
for the slow beginners. Peru and Pink ’Un at once got
going, lengths ahead of Mooltan. The former won from
end to end, whilst Pink ’Un, after being steadied back to
the ruck, came with a rush at the finish into third place.
Mooltan had to be ridden hard to beat everything bar
Peru, and one naturally wondered whether he had gone
off or whether the Grafton horse had come on since the
pair met at Randwick a month ago.
Saturday saw the conclusion of the third round
of Sydney Metropolitan cricket (first grade) with the
result that Glebe heads the gamble with eight competi-
tion points, University is second with only four, Central
Cumberland three, and Waverley, North Sydney, Peter-
sham, Balmain, Middle Harbor and Redfern have two
each. Behind them Paddington heads the struggle in the
mud.
Glebe scored a crushing victory against Gordon,
the suburb where Gregory Wade comes from. With seven
wickets down for 294 Glebe declared, and Gordon was dis-
missed for 187. Following on, Gordon was finally
dismissed for 126—a total of 313, leaving Glebe with only
20 to get to win. The first wicket yielded 31, so Glebe
won by 11 wickets and 11 runs. The smashing up of North
Sydney by Middle Harbor was a very unfilial affair. The
Harbor scored 330 for the first innings, and North Sydney
replied with 280, a first innings win by 50. University’s
win over Central Cumberland was also a one-horse affair.
Central piled up 257 and smiled contentedly; but Uni-
versity responded with 362, and the margin was 105 in favor
of Uni. Redfern and Balmain were more evenly matched,
Redfern scoring 223 to Balmain’s 188, and winning by 35 on
the first innings. Although it has not managed to get its
nose above water, Paddington succeeded in disposing of
Sydney District by a narrow margin of 16 runs, in the
first innings, the figures being 309 to 283. Waverley is
still mighty, and tried hard for a win outright from
Burwood, closing with four sticks down for 258. Burwood
made 138, but managed to prolong the second innings till
124 had been scored for the loss of four wickets, and
Waverley had to be content with a win on the first
innings by 120.
The individual play was very sparkling in some
cases. W. Bardsley, of Glebe, was the mightiest smiter
of the lot, and his little accumulation totalled 137.
Alphabetical White, of North, was next with 119. W. E.
Pite, who is threatening to come out right at the top,
continued his record by totting up 112. P. Gow, the
Paddington boy, carried his bat for 103, and completely
overshadowed Captain Noble’s 51. Little Syd Gregory,
of Waverley, also carried his timber for 102, and went far
in the matter of winning his club’s match. Ducket and
Hopkins, although they failed to reach the century, got
reasonably close to it, having totted up 98 and 92 re-
spectively.
But in spite of these big figures the hat did not
have things all its own way. Kelleway, of Glebe, wrecked
five Gordon wickets for 18, and thereby put in the gloom
Cotter’s four for 54. In the bye match, Petersham
against Callan Park, Law, of the first named, took four for
18. Goddard, of Redfern, laid out three of Balmain’s for
27, and Middleton, of Middle Harbor, four of North Syd-
ney’s for 70. If this sort of thing continues the enthu-
siasm of some of the old bucks in the matter of the
rights of the players will slump.

All the same, the young players who have
batted so well have been carefully ignored in the selection
of the trial teams whose matches wil) replace first grade
cricket in Sydney the coming Saturday and on King’s
Birthday. The old has-beens still hang on, and the
chances of getting into representative cricket in N.S.W.
continue to be as rare as first prizes in Tatt.’s sweeps.
* * * *
Victoria and South Australia meet this week on
the dusty cricket field of Adelaide. Victoria depends
upon the team that won the Sheffield Shield last season,
and Adelaide selection committee has included only one
new man, Whitty, a promising bowler. Clem Hill’s name
appears on the South Australian list, although he hasn’t
played in club cricket this season. Dolling, South’s most
brilliant batsman, stands out owing to the impending
shock of a University examination.
* * * *
The Australian XI. in England next year will
play four test matches of three days each and a fifth
played to a dead finish if the allocation of the rubber
makes it necessary.
The only approach to an upheaval in Melbourne
Pennant cricket on Saturday last was Essendon’s treat-
ment of P’ran—P’ran, which gave East Melbourne a bad
walloping previous Saturday. Essendon rattled up 127
and then got loose on P’ran, demolishing six wickets for
45. One Binnie, presumably a new man, did the mis-
chief, gathering in five of the six for 15. Melbourne,
which is strong enough to make the discussion with St.
Kilda a case of the man walloping the boy 7, heaped
up 207 for eight wickets, while Richmond achieved the
best score with 241 for nine wickets against Northcote.
East Melbourne looks like carrying its contest with South
to a satisfactory conclusion, having dismissed South for
125 and put on 81 for the loss of three wickets. Fitzroy’s
228 against University was more lucky than scientific,
and at present University has made 15 for no loss of
timber. The North Melbourne v. Collingwood entertain-
ment begun b.v North am'assing 183 for eight wickets ;
but, Lord ! it was a weary exhibition.
S. A. reckons Dolling a pretty good thing for
next year’s Australian Eleven. lie has followed faith-
fully the examples of Darling and Olem Hill in making a,
mammoth score (311 in his case) as a Prince Alfred’s
school boy in the' annual “ colleg'e match ” with St.
Peter’s, also in scoring 140 on his first appearance for
S.A. against England. The present season he has started
with consecutive centuries in district cricket. S.A. will
have tremendous batting strength this season, though
its bowling is a quite uncertain quantity 7.

The Amurkan tennis' team to struggle for the
Davis Oup arrived in Sydney recently, but left again im-
mediately to see the Melbourne Oup. As its members
fled over the horizon it was noticed that they 7 are a hefty
crowd and brimful of that needle-like sharpness which
characterises y 7 our true-born tennis player.
* * * *
Maoriland tennis-champion A. F. Wilding has
journeyed all the way from England to loan Australia a
hand at keeping the Davis Oup from going to Amurka.
Norman Brooks will captain the Australasian team, and,
although they come with great reputations, the Yankees
will have to struggle some to get away with'the bauble.
* * * *
The decision to hold the Austral Wheel Race on
the flat grass track at Melbourne Cricket Ground is a last
despairing effort to rake in a Society gate. The O.G. is
popular with the softer sex, but the trouble with the
place is that the enormous crowd of deadhead members
completely wipes out the increase in the attendance. It
is no good having 10,000 extra people if they get in on the
nod or at greatly reduced rates.

Champion cyblist George Horder is still busily
engaged in repairing the damaged surface of himself.
He came to grief, it will be remembered, at Bathurst
some time since, and acquired quite a lot of gravel-rash.
So, while Horder was in sticking plaster, T. J. Gascoyne
swooDed down on the mile scratch race at the Eight Hour
night carnival at Sydney, with Kett and Bestel in close
attendance. Now Gascoyne is out with a challenge to
race any cyclist in the Commonwealth, barring the same
George Horder, for moneys and honor. The number of
moneys he is willing to stake is £5O.

Saturday was an exciting day in Sydney yacht-
ing circles. The Alfred Club was on the water once
more, and the event was the Raw-son Cup. With a hard
southerly blowing, it was reckoned that the cloud-
scraping' Rawhiti would cruel any chance Mr. Muston’s
White Wings might have had of annexing the Rawson
utensil permanently. Mr. Muston won the bauble
With the Janet in 1906 andwith White Wings last season,
and if the elegantly-named yacht could do it once more,
then the handsome trophy would grace'Mr. Muston’s
sideboard permanently. White Wings had four minutes
handicap, but the beautiful Rawhiti was only one minute
behind, with fast flyer Awanui on scratch. In spite of
the gusty wind, spinnakers were hoisted for the run to
Manly, and the procession was a sight to see,
though the extra canvas gave a lot of trouble.
At Manly, White Wings, Rawhiti and Awanui,
in that order, drove the others before them. At Shark
Island, White Wings was running third, Rawhiti fifth,
and Awanui second last. At the Fort, Sunbeam was lead-
ing Rawhiti, White Wings and Awanui in that order, and
then things began to happen. Rawhiti’s jib carried
away; Awanui lost a man overboard, and dropped all
chance of winning at the same time ; and White Wings
danced away to the front. Back at Shark Island White
Wings still "led, and the destination of the Cup began to
look assured. As far as the Cup was concerned the race
was over, and White Wings won easily enough, followed
by Sunbeam, which managed to dash in front of Rawhiti.
It was a great race, and the picturesqueness of it was
added to by the appearance of the deep-keeler Thelma,
the Sayonara Cup challenger, which romped round the
course, revelling in the breeze.

Kipling’s remark to' the effect that “The liner,
she’s a lady,” was borne out on Saturday on Port Jack-
son, when the Sydney Sailing Club’s general handicap
was in full blast. The German liner and others carefully
avoided interfering with the race, but the beastly incom-
ing collier Palmerston drove right through the fleet and
completely destroyed the chances of Vision and Donnelly.
Arthur, which was leading, was least interfered with, and
quickly recovering- opened out and gained a lot of
ground, finishing first, with Donnelly behind.

By winning “The King’s” at the Victorian
Rifle Association’s meeting, Sergeant Stan Edwards, of
the Ma State, has established a just and lawful claim to
the rifle championship of Australia. At the Queensland
R.A. meeting Edwards won “The King’s,” there worth
£25, the championship title and combined aggregate.
Then he mopped up “ The King’s” at the N.S.W. meet-
ing, there worth £lOO, and the championship medal; and
now he rounds it off by winning the same event at the
Victorian meeting, and pockets another £5O. The £175
“King’s” money does not represent all his takings, as
there were several other good cash prizes which fell to
his bag.

The latest news from Arnst is that he has
ceased to roll at all, even in lumpy water. When he
rowed Pearce on the Parramatta, that much-talked-of
roll had completely disappeared as he spun past Abbots-
ford away to the winning-post of Searle’s monument. So
the reasonable view of the roll is that it is a mannerism
adopted by the cyclist-rower, and which he can drop at
any time he wishes to. His recent work has quite aston-
ished the Wanganui people, who are now beginning to
admit that perhaps, after all, it isn’t “ like his infernal
cheek to challenge a man like Webb.” Webb is keeping
very quiet and doing good work.
* ■* * *
The fight between Stanley Ketchell and Wil-
liam Papke seems to have been a cyclonic affair. Papke
refused to shake hands in the ring, and the refusal occa-
sioned much comment. Papke explained that his refusal
was due to the experience gained in a former contest,
when Ketchell, suddenly letting go his hand, caught him
a lofty bash which practically won the fight. It dazed
Papke so much at the outset that he never properly
recovered, and was beaten in short order. This
time he took no risks, but attacked Ketchell with
all his heart and soul and fell upon him. The
ex-champion seems to have taken a considerable
hiding before being counted out, and on one occasion he
was knocked right through the ropes on to the press table.
And even after that he came up smiling. It was in the
12th round that Ketchell was dropped and finally counted
out, but from the very start he seems to have been a
veritable chopping block. Papke’s method seems to be a
wild rush at the opening, and a perfect shower of right
and left upper cuts. Against this whirlwind Ketchell
apparently had no defence, and was knocked down re-
peatedly to take the full count. In fact, he was down five
times in the opening round. Papke emerged from the
slogging with only a light scratch on one cheek, and
apparently quite fresh.* * #
When the Gans-Nelson fight was on, the audi-
ence was astonished to see Nelson’s second on his feet at
the ringside, shouting apparently meaningless words to
the Dane. The general impression was that Mr. Willis
Britt had gone suddenly mad or got howling drunk. But
it seems it was all part of the plan of campaign. The
meaningless words were signals, and, when he was inter-
viewed afterwards, Mr. Britt gave the following lucid
explanation : “ The onlooker sees most of the game, and
so I directed Nelson what to do, and he followed my in-
structions right out. ‘Fairmount’ meant ‘ Hit him on
the dome.’ '* Colma’ stood for‘Cop him
while Los Angeles signified ‘ Slam him in the slats.’
‘Odessa’ meant ‘Hook him on the beak,’ and
‘Alameda’ ‘Slam him on the apricots.’” “Slats” is
good, and “ apricots ”is just lovely. Anyhow, shouldn t
Gans be awarded the victory? He undertook to fight
Nelson, and not Nelson combined with Mr. Willis Britt.
The Yankees are a great nation entirely. Some-
one once said, “ Sing me the songs of a people, and I will
tell \‘ou its character.” Well, here is a song they sang - in
Yankeeland the day after Joe Gans was whipped for the
lightweight championship :
Gone are the days when we had the dough ;
Gone are the champs
Where the has-been champeens go.
Joe’s going, ,Joe’s going, t
And his guard is'sinking low,
For I think I hear someone counting,
Poor black Joe.
So far there is no word as to Mr. Johnson having
covered Tkhminy’s wager that the brown man cannot
stop him in 12 rounds or beat him in 20. And all the
killing of Burns with hik mouth that has been accredited
to Johnson does not make up for that little oversight.
Johnson was welcomed at the Caf6 Frangais last week,
and seemed very fit. Burns was not present, and the
fact is significant. The champion resents the way that
Johnson is reported to have let himself loose. The colored
man is accompanied by his wife, a white woman, some-
what addicted to jewellery. So far, there is no talk of a
“ clergy day ” at Johnson’s preparation, nor has anything
yet been heard cf any welcome bv the ladies of Sydney to
Mrs. Johnson. The Johnsons probably feel slighted.
* * * *
Tommy Burns will undergo his preparation for
the fight with Johnson at that resort of the mighty,
Medlow Hydro (N.S.W.). He will have the use of
one of the detached cottages, and Mark Foy will provide
a special handball court for his particidar edification.
Medlow doesn’t strike one as an ideal place for pugilistic
preparation, out rather for the cultivation of decadence
a la Sardanapalus. Johnson will struggle through his
little bit at the Joseph Banks Hotel, at Botany, a place
haunted by the shades of mighty sports, and will exercise
his skill on Bill Lang, of Melbourne. John Sullivan—the
man who managed to down Squires after a desperate
scrap of 19 rounds—is coming all the way from ’Murka to
getTahmmy right, and may incidentally do a. little scrap-
ping on his own account at Rushcutters Bay stadium.
* * * *
Bruiser Bill Lang had a court case the other
day, and in repudiating a claim for moneys loaned stated
that he taught boxing and played football for a living,
making between £4 and £5 per week. Now, which Mel-
bourne club did Lang play for?
* * * *
“ Billy T.” : The cold audacity that is so marked
a quantity in the “ make-up” of champion Tommy Burns
was much in evidence at the Ed. Williams-Pat O’Keefe
battle in Melbourne, the other nig-ht. It is usual at
functions of this kind for the official referee to manage
and supervise the business inside the ropes, but on this
occasion T. Burns, champion of the Earth, obliged. He
was O’Keefe’s second, and had no call to appoint himself
president, but he did so appoint himself, and the abashed
officials stood round in whispering humbleness while he
dictated and regulated, and concocted a set of rules to
suit the occasion. It was Burns who gathered the prin-
cipals, the seconds, and the referee into the centre, and
explained what was and what wasn’t and what must be.
Then, having' arranged the exact kind of fight he was
prepared to allow, he graciously consented to a beginning,
35 minutes after time. The result was that the Australian
made P. O’Keefe, champion of Ireland, look a very
moderate infant while actual fighting was going on, but
for two-thirds of the time Old Ireland was embracing
Williams, and business was .practically suspended. All
things considered, Williams did remarkably well in
putting a large head on O’Keefe in the short actual fight-
ing time at his disposal. Williams won, but if they meet
again Burns may possibly have a totally different arrange-
ment, whereby it will be necessary 7 for the.referee to hold
Williams while O’Keefe hits him in the eye.

“ All About Dunlop Tyres for 1908-9 ” is now to
hand, and more replete with useful information than ever.
Just as in a camera the lens is everything, so in a
bicycle the tyre is the thing upon which the comfort and
durability of the machine depends. No matter how per-
fect the rest of the machine may be, if the tyre is faulty
that machine is a failure, while with good tyres a much
less elaborate and less worthy machine may be a haven of
comfort and a thing only comparable to a feather bed.

THE SLAVE OF CUSTOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIL. ]
The saddest time of all the year
Is this —Eheu ! fugaces—
For old men, drawn from far and near,
To gather at the races,
Where phantoms steal with footsteps light
Betwixt the blackened embers
Of youthful fires that burned so bright
In long agone Novembers.
What brings the Ancient on the scene,
By mocking visions haunted ?
The ground, beclothed in vernal green,
For him is disenchanted.
No eyes hath he for girls divine
Who eharin the .young beginner,
No hope, as in the auld iang syne,
*Of “ getting on the winner.”
The wife he used to bring is dead,
The chums of yore are scattered,
The din of voices hurts his head,
As though ’twere being battered ;
But still he comes. With small regard
For odds by Isaacs quoted
He views the race, and on his card
The winner’s name is noted.
He comes perhaps in bitter mood
To sneer at boys light-hearted ;
Perhaps he comes to wisely brood
On friends and joys departed.
The fleeting years from youth to age
By Oup Days now he reckons,
And once again to take the stage
He comes—when Custom beckons.

INNOCENCE OR GUILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIL. ]
It was a very bright, interesting day ; you were sorry
when the trams delivered the crowd from the racecourse
back again into the hands of the street charitv-colleotors.
A fair-haired girl of 17 rattled a box of coins in at the tram
door. One tried to be firm, and refuse. “You must
have money,” she said, “ because you come from the
races.”— Daily paper.
We were coming from the races,
And the car was full of smoke ;
It was also fulljof faces
Of the absolutely broke.
You could tell from our grimaces
And the earnest way we cussed
That we’d backed the “stiffs” for places,
And were consequently “ bust.”
We were coming homejin sorrow,
With our features set and grim,
And each chap had tried to borrow
From the fellow nearest him.
For the “books” had had a “skinner”—
Tho’ each punter fiercely said,
“ I’d have backed the blooming winner,
But I thought the brute was ‘ dead.’ ”
I had reached the sad conclusion
That my barque was near the rocks,
When I noticed the intrusion
Of a maiden with a box.
She was young and fair and hearty,
She was golden-haired and sweet;
She was just the little party
That most times we like to meet.
But just now we bluffed the lady ;
We were pleasant, kind, but firm—
Though each thought the other shady,
And a mean, degraded worm.
When she said “ You must have money—
From the races you have come,”
We were neither sad nor funny—
We were merely stricken dumb.
But tell me in your kindness
Ere I lay me down to sleep—
Tell a heathen in his blindness,
Was she innocent or deep?
Was she earnest ? Was she funning ?
Tell me, did her charming smile
Show a simple mind or cunning ?
Was it innocence or guile ?

LEARN TO SWIM
Ayvads er Wing's
2/2, ~
POST FREE.
YOU have simply to attach AYVAD’S
WATER WINGS to your body, and you
can't go under. Water Wings will support
a man of 250 lbs as easily as a child of 50 lbs., and
both on just the level at which a person can swim
or float comfortably. The Wings are made porous
for the reason that it takes less air to support a
large body than it does a smaller one, and they
allow just enough air to escape to adjust them-
selves properly to the size of the body. For
instance, a large body, requiring less air to float
than a smaller one, forces more air from the Wings
than the latter, and is supported on the same level.
The weight of your body governs the amount of air
that stays in the Water Wings—in every case just
the necessary amount of air remains.
If you cannot swim, you will learn in one trial if
you get a pair of AYVAD’S WATER-WINGS.
If you are a swimmer, you will enjoy greater
sport than ever in the water if you use the Wings.
Bear in mind, Water Wings are NOT dangerous.
Can be brought instantly into use. They weigh
only 3 oz., and take up no more room than a pocket
handkerchief. The price is only 2/2, postage paid
anywhere. If you order three pairs, we will give
you free a set of six very comical colouied Penny
Post Cards, entitled “ A Day’s Outing at
Manly or the Post Cards and one pair of Wings
for 2/6, post free.

Mr. J. Lithgow Cobb, an old resident of
. Carcoar (N.S.W.), who died suddenly while on a
visit to England, was the first manager of the
Commercial Bank at Lambing Flat, also he was
the first manager of the same bank’s branch at
Carcoar. Twenty years ago he retired from the
overdraft and set up as a grazier. He was
Coroner at the time of the murder of bank
manager Phillips and Miss Cavanagh at the City
Bank, Carcoar, and drew attention to himself by
telling the jury at the inquest that the eyes of the
whole civilised world were centred upon the spot
where they were then assembled. This con-
centrated gaze staggered the jury and made it feel
broken up. Mr. Cobb married the adopted child
of Mr. Barnard Stimpson, who represented
Carcoar in one of the early N.S.W. Parliaments.
“ D.’s ” little tribute :
Dean Slattery, who went aloft last week, was one of
the most genuinely sporting old clerics in the Common-
wealth. For over a quarter of a century, from about 1865
onwards, he attended to the souls of such Monaro folk as
belonged to the Church the Sydney Watchman would
like to see resumed. He put in every moment he had to
spare from soul-repairing, driving about the landscape in
quest of game. He wasn’t much of a shot, but for expert
knowledge of where game was to be found and how to
approach it when located he was unsurpassed. He is be-
lieved in Cooma and environs to have accounted for more
w'ild turkeys in his day than any other man in Australia.
His talents were not confined to slaying these fowl in
large numbers; he also cooked them with marvellous
skill. A turkey-feast with the Dean on what he had come
to consider his native heath (to wit any of the country
between Bega and Dalgety) was a notable experience.
He was an impressive spectacle in the presence of those who
assailed the Dalgety capital site on the score of its climate.
He held that it was possible for a normal man to sleep out
all the year round on Monaro and be the better for it.
The Monaro climate reminded him, he said, of “ Kerry in
the Spring,” and higher praise than that he could not
bestow.
“ Melb.” holds forth :
With the Medical Congress just over, it is instructive
to turn up David Syme’s autobiography as to his experi-
ences with doctors. Towards the close of 1865 he broke
down badly. He had to go away for eight months to
England. He returned without improvement, and every
life office refused to accept him. He went round to the
distinguished medicoes, making his selection from the
Fitzgeralds, Gillbees, Beaneys, Motherwells, Barkers, and
so forth, of that era, now all disappeared. They mostly
agreed that his lungs were affected. One said the top of
the right lung ; another the bottom of the left. Canny
Davy sat down and thought hard, and remembered that
all these doctors knew him, and knew also that brother
Ebenezer died from consumption. With that he went to
a young doctor, a new arrival. The young man said the
lungs were all right; it was plain liver. Well, anybody
looking at sallow' Auld Lang Syme ought to have been
able to diagnose that. The doctors agreed, in 1866, that
if Syme stuck to the Age his life was only worth a few
months’ purchase. He stuck. If he had wrought 15 hours
a day before, he started working an extra one. Voltaire
was told at the age of 80 that coffee was a slow poison.
“Very slow,” said he. The Age kept Syme up like Pick-
wick’s cabhorse that u'ould have dropped dead if taken
out of the shafts.

During the half-year the directors have secured a share of the Commonwealth Government account, and the
Royal Bank now stands on the same footing as the other banks in regard to all Government business, Common-
wealth and State, the full advantage of which, however, has not yet been experienced.
In view of the present strong demand for money, the directors felt that it would be judicious to further increase
the capital of the bank, and they accordingly invited applications for 100,000 new shares at a premium of 2s. 6d. per
share, and they are pleased to announce that the operation was a complete success, the applications received being
largely in excess of the number of shares available. When all the instalments have been paid, the capital will stand
at £300,000, and the reserve fund (with the'addition recommended above) at £107,500.
The shareholders are once more urged to continue their valued assistance in bringing business to the bank.
Everyone can help to some extent, and the bank has greatly benefited in the past from the loyal co-operation of the
large and influential body of shareholders. By order of the Board. H. T. WILSON, General Manager.

From a man who is condemned to wear
one of the coats of Joseph hereinafter mentioned
The Government’s short-sightedness, or tight-pursed-
ness, when building country schoolhouses is so enormous
that it ou"ht to be bracketed with the great natural
resources of Australia. It there are 50 children available
for school in a rapidly-growing township it builds (m
accordance with plans and specifications marked Al—
R 0 T.”) a miserable place to accommodate the oO—and
no more. And the plans and specifications (marked “ Al
—R.O.T.”) are so stereotyped that any additions will
make the structure a public eyesore and a smudge on the
landscape. As a consequence, when the roll increases to
75 or 100, an entirely .iew schoolhouse has to be erected,
or the old one (which may be only a year or two advanced
in life) has to be added to and patched up till it begins to
resemble Joseph’s coat. The authorities ought to at
least inquire into the population potentialities of the
districts concerned before they start building 1 . Very
often a little inquiry would save the country a lot ot
money, the children a deal of discomfort, and theauthon-
ties themselves from looking foolish —and from being
exactly what they look.

CUTICURA CUREDHER
ECZEMA PERMANENTLY
•
" Last August I found a little pimple
exactly on the crown of my little daugh-
Sc
"in
ter’s head. It be-
gan to grow larger
and larger, and later
it broke and hu-
mour came from it.
The head began to
be covered with an
eruption with hu-
mour exuding freely.
Annie suffered ter-
ribly, and her head
was so itchy that
she scratched it un-
til she tore the flesh,
end at night we
had to tie her hands,
the itching was so
fearful. The erup-
tion spread over the
whole of her head,
down part of her
back, and even over
her face. A doctor’s ointment did her
no good. In fact, it seemed to make the
trouble •worse, and the itching increased
until it was unbearable. If one spot
healed another became worse. When
the trouble started her health began to
fail, she was peevish, and grew thinner
day by day. I was in despair. At
last 1 tried Cuticura Soap, Cuticura
Ointment, and Cuticura Pills. At the
very first application the itching stopped,
as if by magic, and her head became
better every day. In ten days the
humour ceased altogether, and by the
time I had used one set of Cuticura
Remedies she was almost cured. I
got another set, and in a month she was
completely cured, so that you could not
tell she had ever had eczema. That
was three months ago and there has
never been any sign of a recurrence
since. Her health is better than ever,
and I ascribe her condition entirely to
Cuticura Remedies. Her hair is grow-
ing thicker and thicker, too. Mrs. John

o
The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
power over the above-named complaints.
Frootoids are elegant in appearance and
pleasant to take; they are immensely
more valuable than an ordinary aperient;
they remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident by the disappearance of headache,
a bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient medi-
cine to take when any Congestion or
Blood Poison is present, or when Conges-
tion of the Brain or Appoplexy is present
or threatening. They have been tested,
and have been proved to afford quick
relief in such cases when other aperients
have not done any good at all.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver;
a dose taken at bed-time, once a week, is
highly beneficial.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a dose
of 'Frootoids, instead of an ordinary
aperient. The patient thus gradually
becomes independent of Aperient Medi-
cines.

“ The Country’s Misfortune.”
“ Ganesha ” writes from India :
India suffers from many misfortunes—Freetrade, pesti-
lence, cheap labor, Imperialism, etc.—but, unlike our
Mr. Johnston, some of the people are not satisfied. Last
year’s record of bubonic plague reached 1,204,194 deaths.
Native mill hands, in Bombay, went on strike, breaking-
out in serious disorder. They attacked the police with
stones. The police, replied with revolvers. Yet. the
rioters, many of whom were killed or wounded, were not
enthusiastic. Demonstrations were held ; bazaars were
closed ; orators exhorted the nation in three or four or 26
languages to examine its misfortunes to see how great
they were. The feeling of discontent against existing
institutions spreads throughout India. In Calcutta the
Babu has taken to anarchy, and endeavors to remove his
country’s misfortunes by bombs. But usually he prefers
the Silent Strike, a method he has made a fine art.
Editor after editor has been fined and imprisoned for
“seditious” leading articles, till at last, when a man
takes his seat in the editorial chair, he first says farewell
to his wife and family, as though he were embarking on a
long journey. He probably is. A popular leader like
Lala Rajpat Rai was deported without trial, and with-
out explanation he was permitted to return. A paternal
Government passed a Seditious Meetings Bill prohibiting
any 20 people meeting at a private bungalow, or at the
local hairdresser’s, or under a banyan tree. And in order
that everybody might be perfectly satisfied it adopted
Russian methods of flogging students, many of them
mere boys, for holding opinions at all. The Country’s
Misfortune seems to be synonymous with the Blessings of
British Rule.
The latest tale of woe is the transportation of Bal Gan-
gadhar Tilak for certain remarks he offered anent the
country’s eternal misfortune.
Tilak was charged with committing an offence against
the Indian penal code in connection with an article en-
titled “ The Country’s Misfortune,” which was published
in his weekly newspaper, the Kesari. The trial occupied
eight days, Tilak’s address taking up six. The jury,
which consisted of seven Europeans and two Parsees,
returned a verdict of “ Guilty ” by a majority of seven to
two.
The verdict failed to give India satisfaction. In con-
sequence of the disturbances that resulted from it, Sir
George Sydenham Clarke, Governor of Bombay (late
Governor of Victoria), summoned a private meeting of
leading citizens and expressed dissatisfaction at not re-
ceiving the support which the Government was entitled
to expect. He warned his hearers that the Government
would not be deterred from enforcing the law, nor the
Courts from administering justice, by useless demonstra-
tions, strikes, or the closing of the bazaars.
Tilak is the “ Extremist ” leader of the “ most danger-
ous rebels in India.” According to another view, he is
“ India’s noblest son.” He has been previously im-
prisoned for seditious writings and orations. He is the
proprietor and editor of two weekly papers, the Kesari,
published in the vernacular, with a circulation of 21,000,
and the Mahratta, published in English, with 11,000
circulation.
He is a Mahratta Brahmin, aged about 50, who lives in
rebellious Poona. A man of culture, one of the few dis-
tinguished Sanscrit scholars of the world, he has great
influence on Indian thought, and his advice has fre-
quently been sought by Government officials on points of
administration.
He is a severe critic of the bureaucratic Government,
but an open and straightforward opponent. For years
past he has pointed out some of the results of the Bless-
ings of British Rule—the drain of £30,000,000 a year to
England from a poor country ; the unexplained increase
of plague and famine ; the decay of Indian trades and
manufactures for the benefit of Birmingham overlords;
the driving of the population to agriculture, which
is already overcrowded to an alarming extent. Indian
mills and hand looms have fallen into disuse, and
12,000,000 weavers can’t find anything to do. Yet labor
is not extravagantly dear. In Bombay an average
“hand’s” wage is 18 rupees a month; the highest
woman’s wage is 10 rupees; boys and girls over 14, work-
ing 13 hours a day, earn eight rupees ; and children under
nine, working half-time, receive four rupees a month.
And the rupee is only 15.,4d. Many families live in single
rooms in galleries over the shops, and live on rice and
peas. On the land (and 80 per cent, of the people are on
the land) if a man makes £2 10s. a year he is doing more
than well. And India still remains unsatisfied.
Looking up Tilak’s papers, it is seen that his policy has
always been consistent. He has long advocated such
measures as “ Swadeshi,” which is Voluntary Protection,
a patriotic feeling that demands home-made goods, inde-
pendent of cost or convenience (a “ Swadeshi” or “Made-
in-Australia ” sign would look better than “ Imported ”
on collars and fish and boots displayed in many a Sydney
shop). He advocates boycott, if necessary, against foreign
goods, and passive resistance—nothing more violent or
seditious than that, nothing that could be construed into
an attempt at subverting the Government.
Certain reforms that Tilak proposes could look revolu-
tionary only to an Anglo-Indian, viz., that an Indian
(nominated or elected) should be included in each of the
Executive Councils, at present consisting of three
Europeans only ; the old demand for the separation of
judicial and executive functions throughout the country ;
better representation in the municipal governments of
districts ; the granting of widows’ pensions to Indians in
the Civil Service, such as are granted to the English; and
the holding of Civil Service examinations in India as well
as in England.
Tilak’s most remote idea), which he does not hold to be
within the sphere of practical politics, is Home Rule for
India on the model of Australia or Canada—an ideal he
sets one or two generations ahead.
In passing sentence of six years’ transportation of
Tilak, Justice Davar remarked that the Kesari article
“seethed with sedition, preached violence, approved of
murder, and hailed the employment of bombs,” a wild
and whirling misrepresentation, as Tilak took great care
to discountenance violence in any form. But he said:
“ Reform of the Administration is the only medicine to
be administered internally for this disease, and if the
bureaucracy does not make use of that medicine at this
time, then it must be considered a great misfortune for
all of us ” —remarks that the average Anglo-Indian would
consider more revolutionary than a reflection on the
Prince of Wales’ trousers or the first principles of the
French Revolution.
Since misunderstanding, natural or acquired, between
the sahib and the native reaches such gigantic proportions,
nothing seems more likely than another Mutiny. Inno-
cently, or with malice aforethought, both parties are
working up~for a general smash. Except to the Birming-
ham manufacturer who wants a big market, the fat
money-lender of Park-lane who has Vested Interests
which must be protected, and the Younger Son who
wants a soft job in a hard world, India is of no use to the
Empire ; indeed, in time of stress, it would prove a fear-
some weakness. And certainly English Freetrade and
English goods, from corsets to saucepans and Governors,
have been of slight service to the dusky millions of Hin-
dustan.
The Indian Empire is a showy but foolish farce ; and
nobody—Viceroy or drummer, Parsee, Hindu, Sikh, Ma-
hommedan, Pathan, Tommy Atkins, Lal Singh, Rudyard
Kipling, Keir Hardie, or Tilak—seems to be really satis-
fied.
When Bent wants to strike an attitude and
appear majestic, one of his tricks is to ask some-
body whether he wouldn’t like a railway. As a
result, the Vic. Railways Standing Committee is
sent poking round, and in the course of the poking
round it is finding out some queer things. The
other day it visited Inglewood and sat to inquire
into a proposed railway extension to Durham Ox.
Only three people troubled to turn up. One
wasn’t particularly enthusiastic ; another thought
the line should run from Bridgewater and not
from Inglewood at all; the third—the mayor-
remarked that of course “ we would like the line,
but, to tell the honest truth, I don’t think it whll
ever pay.” After that the Committee proceeded
to investigate the Shellburne to Newbridge ex-
tension, but there wasn’t a solitary witness
to tell the members even as much as Inglewood’s
mayor did. So they journeyed back to town with a
confirmed impression that Bent overdoes the
bluffing business sometimes.
G-. L. Bonython, father of Editor Bony-
thon, owner of the S. Aus. Advertiser, is still
alive and reasonably well. He completed his
88th year on the Bth day of the Bth month in the
year 1908. He has lived in Adelaide for nearly
60 years.

“ Flounder ” on the Melbourne fish
mystery and the Fish Commission which sitteth
thereon :
Commonwealth fish expert Dannevig, appearing before
the Vic. Fish Commission, threw some light on a very
dark matter. He asserted that “ the principal trouble in
connection with the fishing industry lay in the Melbourne
market, where the auctioneers were in reality dealers,
who not only handled the fish as a merchantable com-
modity, but also assisted some of the fishermen,
by supplying them with nets, for a considera-
tion of 10 per cent, on the profits of their
catches.” Furthermore, he said, when there was a
gjut in the market they sent the fisherman payment for
his whole catch at the rate of the average price realised
that day, and sent any surplus to the cool stores ; said
surplus being subsequently sold by them whenever the
market suited—and that would naturally be when there
was a profit in the transaction. Dannevig calculated that
the fisherman averaged ljd. per lb. for fish for which the
public subsequently paid an average of Bd. to Is. per lb.
The only remedy he could suggest was the appointment
by the Government or the City Council of salaried
auctioneers. After Dannevighad finished an ex-fishmonger
(retail) came along and told the Commission that 90 per
cent, of the fishmongers and hawkers were in the clutches
of the agents or auctioneers ; that he had “ seen hawkers
come to the market and take their barrows away empty,
though there was plenty fish in the market at the time.
... It did not suit the agents to sell. Between the cool
storesand thesmoker—where smoked barracoutaand other
dried condiments are manufactured —they held the fisher-
man and the public in the hollow of their hand.” Further-
more, he volunteered the information that any hawker
or fishmonger who would dareito come and say what he had
said would invite immediate ruin. It was an unpleasant
tale, and speedily moved the auctioneers to emphatic but
uncorroborated denials. Unfortunately, the Herald next
day sent a reporter to investigate, and there happened to
be an uproar over a condemned basket of fish. These fish
proclaimed themselves rotten—at some yards’ distance—
but so scarce was the supply, and so keen the demand,
that several hawkers battled with the market inspector
tor the over-ripe edibles, and a constable ulti-
mately had to be called in to escort the abomina-
tion to the condemned chamber or “dead house.”
thereupon the Herald man went a little further
into the question ; and in the aforesaid dead house he
found 2cw't. of condemned fish, which had come out of
the cool store— not direct from the fisherman —and in the
cool stores he fonnd 40 baskets of fish- —something like a
ton. All this was fairly conclusive proof that the
immaculate auctioneers weren’t exactly paragons of
veracity. Take it all round, it is a pretty kettle of fish,
ami should interest our recent Scottish visitors. Also it
should impress on Mr. Dannevig the necessity for con-
tinuing his researches into the ways of the fish-dealer—
the dubious, tortuous ways that conduct the fish from
i lie boat-man’s net to the consumer’s door.

eadache
And Stomach Troubles.
A CONSTANT SUFFERER CURED.
HEADACHE sufferers often fly to desperate
remedies for ease. The surest, safest and
speediest cure for this painful complaint is
Bile Beans. Bile Beans banish headache, as they do
all other symptoms of digestive disorder, by correct-
ing the liver and stomach in a natural manner and
by natural means, for Bile Beans are compounded
solely from Nature’s finest vegetable remedies.
Bile Beans will cure a sick headache in a day, and a
regular course will permanently remove the cause,
banishing sick headaches from your life altogether.
“ I have been a sufferer for a number of years,” says Mrs.
S. A. Clare, of 23 Phillip Street, Alexandria, Sydney, “with
splitting headaches, and wind on the stomach. Sometimes I
have been obliged to lay up for days together, unable to do
anything but wish I were dead, and at times I have really
thought I was near my last days. I tried many remedies
advertised to cure the complaints I suffered from, but my
money seemed to be thrown away, and I was at a loss to know
what next to do, when a friend who had benefited by the use
of Bile Beans advised me to try them. lam glad to say that
the very first dose had such a beneficial effect that I continued
to use them, and now after having used only one box, I am
quite a different woman. Instead of the periodical splitting
headaches, which I dreaded, I am speedily losing the old troubles, and am pleased to say
I am in much better health, and prefer Bile Beans to all other medicines.
THE STANDARD FAMILY MEDICINE.
BILE BEANS do not force unnatural and artificial action of the stomach and
liver, but they strengthen and restore the natural functions of the body, and
restore the balance of health. Bile Beans are a speedy cure for Headache, Indiges-
tion, Biliousness, Liver and Stomach Troubles, Constipation, Piles, Bad Blood, Bad
Breath, Anaemia, Loss of Appetite, and all disorders of the Liver, Stomach
and Digestive Organs. Obtainable from all Chemists and Stores at Is. lgd.,

Carisford’s Truth.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
IT is rather a tragic little story, this, though
Carisford would have made it funny if any
man could. He was not cut out for a doctor
—not the kind of doctor who goes round with an
insurance agent, anyway, and I found that out
before we had been together twelve hours. He
was a big, lean slab of a boy, with glasses well
down on his hooked nose, and a thrust-out chin,
and a stoop in his back, and a deadly dogmatic
fashion of commenting on the old women’s symp-
toms that made them hate him on the spot.
“ What you want is tact,” I told him on the
night before we left Gundabine. “ You’ve no
more tact than a leg of beef, you know, and that
doesn’t suit the ordinary individual. Why did
you tell old Joe Bassett that he smelt like a pole-
cat of bad whisky, and Mrs. Bassett that no one
would write a policy on her life unless she let out
her belts six inches ?”
“ I only speak the truth,” he said, mumbling
over his pipe.
“ And that’s just what no man with a living to
make can afford to speak,” I said. “ You want
to tell each candidate for a policy that he or she is
the most interesting individual you’ve ever come
across. You want to listen to all the tommyrot
they talk as if you liked to listen. And—you
want to joke with them.”
He turned round, and in the flicker of the one
gas jet his big-boned white face and the light on
his round glasses reminded me of a turnip ghost.
“Perry,” he said solemnly, “life is far too
serious a thing to be joked about. When you see
men and women hastening to the grave ”
“All right,” I said, hurriedly. “But you
needn’t hasten ’em more. Say pretty things to
them, and let them forget that the company will
have to dub up on their death some day.”
“I can’t tell anything but the truth,” said
Carisford. ‘ ‘ And I have noticed that pretty
remarks are often untrue. Surely you have ob-
served that trait in my character, Perry ? ”
I told him that I had. I also told him that
Truth was the biggest handicap that a man could
be born with—unless he had the common sense to
repress it occasionally. And Carisford looked at
me with his round glasses and the point of light
on his chin that suggested another eye, and told
me that he considered that levity in connection
with Life was like putting up an Aunt Sally among
the statuary in the Sydney Art Gallery.
But it was only the next day that the something
began which made the man human —and I really
doubt if he was human before—and which also
lost the company a good lump sum. We drove
out of Gundabine on the hottest morning of a hot
midsummer, with 50 miles of open bush-country
and rough, hilly scrub land and general cussedness
to cover before night. And our near horse ricked
his shoulder in a rabbit hole and went lame, and
the water-bottle leaked, and Carisford talked
diseases until I wanted to get out and die in a
way of my own. It so happened that I very
nearly did; for at the midday halt I went to
sleep in a saltbush, and a scorpion stung my hand
badly.
I remember coming out of that bush at a pace
which surprised Carisford, who was dozing in the
mulga. And then, in one leap, he had his two
hands round my wrist, and his chin out, and his
big glasses focussed on my hand. It swelled like
ten —I saw it swelling as I watched ; and lam
not going to say anything about the pain or the
sudden cold fear that seemed to settle down at
the pit of my stomach.
“ I’m not going to die,” I told Carisford, and
felt my jaw ache at the surge of agony that ran
up my arm.
“ I am the only person who can tell you that,”
said Carisford, solemnly, and whipped the little
mark of the bite out with a clean turn of his knife.
“ What’ll you bet ?” said I, feeling sick—and
sicker for fear I should show it.
“ It is sinful to bet on such a matter as life or
death,” he told me. And when I laughed, half
in hysteria, he lifted his gig-lamps a moment.
“ I always told you you were a scoffer,” he
said. “ But take things seriously now. You must
not let your temperature get up.”
He spoke as if it was something a man could
sit on ; and I giggled again while he strapped
my arm, and used the remainder of the water-
bottle on it, and gave me something to drink out
of his medicine-chest. The heat of the day and
the heat of my blood were fast putting me in a
raging fever, and I will say that for once Caris-
ford took charge properly, and didn’t waste any
time in talking about the solemnity of Life.
We had passed a free selector’s cottage about a
mile back, and Carisford proposed to take me
there.
“For we’re going to have a fight for it,” he
said. “ With your blood in the state it is and
your temperature going up, I wouldn’t be telling
the truth if I let you think there was no danger.”
I wasn’t making any bids for truth just then.
But I had to have it just the same. I wondered
what sort of obituary notice Carisford would give
me—truthfully. And Carisford got the horses up
to the pole somehow, and dragged me into the
trap, and headed back for that cottage as a
donkey goes for a carrot. He didn’t know which
rein belonged to which horse, and he nearly
upset us over every stump, and he cut a groove in
my cheek with the whip-lash. But he made good
time ; and for all the torment I was in I began to
feel a strange kind of confidence in the man. He
had not handled horses a dozen times in his life,
I should judge ; but he got to the cottage gate
somehow, and hauled his team to a standstill.
The place was the ordinary selector’s humpy.
It was made of rough timber, standing on five-foot
piles, with a verandah running the length of it,
and a goat tethered to one of the piles. But there
were signs of cultivation beyond, and a couple of
broken-down plough-horses in a yard, and a
neatly-stacked wood-pile. I saw all these things
in the blazing white heat of the day as a man sees
things in a dream.
Then a dog ran out, yapping round the team.
And a moment after a girl came round the house
corner and halted. Her head was bare, and her
arms were bare ; she had no collar, and her boots
were heavy. But I knew her—both then and
afterwards—for the kind of girl God meant women
to be, and I think Carisford knew it too.
She stood with her head flung up and her fine
young body straightened. Then she dropped the
load of sticks she was carrying, and sprang for-
ward. I stumbled, and slid through Carisford’s
arms to the dried dusty grass by the gate ; and I
saw the pulse beating in her round, firm throat as
she stooped over me, and the light of pity and
strength in her wide eyes.
Her hands were cooler than Carisford’s, and
her voice held a light cheery note like the song of
a magpie. But beyond that I don’t remember
much of her until later—Carisford said that it
was two days later—when I lay out on some
sacks in the verandah, with a grassfire burning to
keep away the mosquitoes, and Carisford ambling
up to feel my pulse.
He let himself down on his knees beside me,
stiffly.
“You are suffering much less pain to-night,”
he said, sticking his chin out.
I felt like what a man has described as “some-
thing the cat has brought in.” But Carisford
would have made me flippant if I were being post-
mortemed.
“ I’m the only person who can tell you that,” I
told him. And then I heard the girl’s laugh, and
she slipped down beside Carisford, and put a hand
on my forehead.
“You’re all right,” she said, and her voice
held the slow, cut-in-half twang of Australia’s
back-country. “You’ve got your senses back.
Do you know the differ., eh ?”
“ There isn’t any differ, with some folk,” I said,
feebly. “But Ido know that I’m very hungry.”
She fed me with gentle hands, and she talked
to me in merry baby-talk, making believe that I
was a sick child, and that Carisford, puzzled and
deeply contemptuous on the verandah-edge, was
an incompetent nurse who had been discharged
for awkwardness.
And after that I lay still, and something of
mystery crept round me in the half-dark. The
grass-fires smoked thickly in their tins. Beyond
them two black, unmoving humps squatted on the
boards, suggestive of some living animals. Beyond
the humps stretched the pale grey of the paddock
under the vivid stars, and beyond again the bush-
line rose to meet those stars. Carisford crouched
over the fire, smoking pipe after pipe, with the
leap and sudden glow of the flame on his big, bony
wrists and cheekbones, and a gravity above the
usual round the straight mouth on the pipe-stem.
The girl passed in and out with quick, neat steps
and free, vigorous movements and a gay word now'
and again for Carisford, who pulled out his pipe
and stared at her dumbly in answer.
It was very still. I heard the croaking of some
frogs far off, and the hum of the mosquitoes near
at hand, and the occasional sob of the little
flames. Then the girl came out, and paused by
the humps, and stooped over them, speaking low.
Then the humps rose up, like bears rising on
their hind legs, and I knew them for men, though
they shambled as animals might. She took them
in, one on each side of her. I heard their low,
indistinct growls in answer to her gay voice ; but
I could see no more than their outlines, and I
dozed again, too weak to feel wonder and horror.
When I roused again, the girl was sitting beside
Carisford w’ith her chin cupped in her hand and
her wide eyes on the fire. In the light, as it rose
and fell, I saw the big, sweet mouth, and the
straight nose, and the expression which was a
better hall-mark of her nature than the roughened
skin and the coarse stuff of her dress. Body and
soul she was made for high places, that girl. But
she took greater rank than I knew.
Carisford had evidently been speaking to her,
for presently she turned her head, looking at him.
“ I don’t feel as I could do it,” she said. “ I
don’t feel as I could.”
Carisford jerked out his pipe, and uncurled his
long legs.
“ Look here,” he said, earnestly, “you know
they’ll never be any better ? ”
The girl nodded. Her hair had red lights
where the fire struck it.
“Well then,” said Carisford, “what do you
expect ? Do you mean to work for them till you
die ? ”
“ They work,” said the girl. “ I can get Sam
to do a day’s ploughing often, and Micky always
hoes the potato-patch and the onions. They work
for me, but I don’t think they’d work for anyone
else.”
There was a very queer expression on Caris-
ford’s face as he looked at her. It was as though
the man’s soul was waking—slowly, as water
soaks up through a cloth.
“ Don’t you want anything better of life than
that ? ” he asked.
“ They are my brothers,” said the girl. “ I
am the only one left to look after them. I—l
don’t see as I could let ’em go away from me.”
“Are there any other folk near here?’’de-
manded Carisford, going off on a tack of his own.
“ Oh, lots. Selectors, an’ splitters, an’ so on.”
“ And hasn’t any one of them tried to persuade
you to send your brothers to an institution, and to
let him take care of you and work for you ? ” said
Carisford, bluntly.
I always knew that the man had no tact, but
this staggered me. I wriggled round on the sacks
to get a good look at the girl’s face. The scarlet
on it was more than firelight, and the quiver of
her lips was more than the quiver of the throbbing
flame. Then she laughed—a shaky laugh.
“ S’posin’ they have,” she said. “ I ain’t
goin’ to be bossed by any selector of ’em all.
I’m my own mistress here —an’ I can manage
along all right, takin’ one year wi’ another. ”
She fell silent, with her chin in her hand again.
The big, wide eyes on the fire were sad, and the
dark shadows moving across the starlit patch of
paddock seemed to suggest gloom in some quiet
way. Carisford grunted, knocked out his pipe,
and stuck it in his pocket. I knew that he was
going to hit all the nails he could reach with that
sledge-hammer tongue of his.
“This is not a life for a woman,” he said.
‘ ‘ Least of all for a woman like you. It would be
far better for you, mentally and physically, to
send them away and marry some good man who

KIDNEY TROUBLE affects PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY
Though no two persons alike are
affected in precisely the same way by
kidney disorder, the danger is always
equally great. One man may suffer
from pains in the back and loins, or
from rheumatism—another may have
urinary troubles, and his eyes may be
puffy and swollen; one woman may
notice heart irregularity, she may be
sleepless, nervous and despondent—
her neighbor may have all the
symptoms of dropsy or Bright’s disease.
It depends on the sufferer’s constitution
and the nature of the impurities kept
back in the body by the blood filters—
the kidneys.
Doan's Backache
Kidney Pills
should be taken at the FIRST
sign of anything wrong.
They are the reliable medicine for
every disorder caused directly or in-
directly through kidney weakness or
inflammation; they drive out the uric
acid that irritates the kidney mem-
branes and clogs the passages. Doan’s
Pills help the kidneys in their great
blood-filtering work, and give tone to
the whole kidney organism.

SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
A SYDNEY WOMAN.
Mrs. S. O’Rourke, 39 Griffin Lane, Surry Hills, Sydney,
says : —“ For nine years I’ve been troubled with the kidneys.
In that time I used all sorts of remedies, but the first to do
me good was Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills ; these were Al.
I used to get pains in the back and across the shoulders, hot
flushes of blood to my head, burning pain under the eyes; I
was frightfully nervous, and had palpitation of the heart.
Regarding the pain in my back, after stooping I would have
to ease myself up. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills started
to relieve me when I had taken a few doses. After I had
taken them for a week I felt so well that I forgot to take
them. Anybody who needs a kidney medicine should get
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Mrs. O’Rourke confirms the above seven years later
“I am still free of every distressing symptom mentioned
above, and have been ever since Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills cured me, seven years ago. This remedy is unrivalled
for the cure of kidney ailments.”
A SYDNEY MAN.
Mr. William Carroll, sen., ex-Railway Guard, 749
Harris Street, Ultimo, says: —“Some time ago I strained
myself pushing some heavy trucks, and soon noticed the
effect in the small of my back. For three solid months I
was unable to work. I had a very lame back, and a dull
pain through the loins and the kidneys, and my secretion
became unnatural and irregular. I used Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, and obtained wonderful relief. lam so much
better, I can now do heavy work. lam firmly convinced
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a true kidney remedy,
and I never fail to recommend them among my friends.”
Mr. Carroll makes a second statement: —“I am still
well, and have never suffered with my kidneys since Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me eight years ago.”

would make life easy for you. ”
Her lips were smiling, but I could see the big
tears in her eyes.
“ Would it be better for them ? ” she asked.
“ Your brothers ? They’d be well taken care
of, well fed, and so on."’
“ I can do that for ’em. Would they have the
bush to poke rc*un’ in, an’ the magpies to sit an’
listen to, an’ the ants to watch in their buildin’,
an’ would they be free to go jus’ where they
likes? ”
“Well, er—not exactly. But”
‘ ‘ Then you’re thinkin’ of me only ? ” said the
girl.
She said it quite simply, with her eyes turned
on him, and the light playing over her young,
shapely figure and her fine throat. Carisford
glowed a furious scarlet. But his truth did not
desert him.
“ I—l was,” he stammered.
The girl stood up with a free, erect spring of the
muscles. She rested her hands lightly on her
hips, and looked down at him.
“You’re a good sort,” she said, “But you
ain’t got brothers o’ your own, has you ? They
kind o’ follow me roun’. . . an’ they want me all
the day . . . an’ ... I reckon I couldn’t send
’em away from me. They’d want me so almighty
bad.”
Carisford stood up. He was more moved than
I had thought possible.
“ I—l will not try to persuade you any more,”
he said. “ Life is too solemn a thing for any in-
dividual to attempt to meddle with the private
opinions of another individual.”
The girl threw her head back and laughed. It
was a really merry laugh.
“Lor’, you are funny,” she said. “ I don’t
reckon it’s solemn. If you could see the fellers
cornin’ roun’ on Sat’day afternoons an’ Sundays,
an’ lendin’ a hand wi’ the ploughin’ an’ the potato
pits, you’d see some things as’d make you grin.
No; I’m all right, thank you, mister. But—
there’s jus’ one thing as bothers me. P’raps I’ll
tell you to-morrow. Id’ know.”
She went in swiftly, with a backward nod that
showed a gleam of white teeth and a shine of the
wide eyes. Carisford came over and plumped
himself down on the sacks by my feet.
“ It’s iniquitous,” he said, and glared at me.
“ Quite so,” I said. “ I thought you con-
sidered life too solemn to go flirting, Carisford.”
“ Stop that,” said Carisford, sharply, and I
saw a change in the man’s grey, bony face. ‘ ‘ She—
she is an extremely noble woman, and I respect
her intensely. But I think that such self-sacrifice
is—is abnormal.”
“ Possibly some selector is at the bottom
of it,” I suggested.
Carisford faced round on me with his eyes pop-
ping through his glasses—very nearly. But he
said only :
“ I am glad I am not you, Perry.”
“So am I,” I said. “ And now perhaps you’ll
tell me what you have been talking about. ”
I don't know how long he took to tell it, for I
fell asleep with his heavy words dropping still on
my hearing. But I gathered that the two animals
on hind-legs were the girl’s two brothers, and that
they had been hopeless idiots from birth. I
gathered also —perhaps because Carisford did not
tell me so—that the girl’s cheery pluck and the
unusual circumstances of her life had touched the
man in a way wherein he had never been touched
before, and which he would not for a long time
forget.
It was broad midday when I heard from Caris-
ford of the one thing that troubled the girl. He
came to me, breathing rather short ; and his face
was streaked with red, as I had seen it before
when he was much agitated. He could not keep
his great bony hands still one moment, and he
kicked the wall incessantly with his great shambling
feet. When I knew the whole thing, some
months later, I did not wonder at this. But just
at the time I swore at him roundly. Carisford
would have given a stone Buddha nerves.
“ She wants her life insured,” he said. “ While
she lives she thinks she can keep those two men.
But she doesn’t want to leave them penniless when
she dies. ”
I looked beyond the verandah to. the plough-
horses toiling through the brown paddock under
the level sun. One of the animals meandered
along behind, looking more than ever like a bear
on its hind-legs. I could hear the creak of the
rusty chains, and the occasional chest-cough-of a
horse, and the everlasting whining drone kept up
by the idiot.
“Can she afford to pay the premiums?” I
asked.
“ She says so,” said Carisford, shortly.
“ She looks like a womkn to live a long life.
Have you examined her ? ”
Carisford walked to the edge of the verandah
and stood. His back was more bowed than ever,
and his chin more thrust-out, and his glasses lower
on his nose. He looked like some strange kind of
water-fowl, such as pictures show on the banks of
the Nile—or somewhere else.
Then he came back. And the man's face was
ghastly white, and sweat showed on the forehead.
“I have examined her,” he said, slowly.
“It is a first-class life. She is only 23, and she
comes of a healthy family. There is no trace of
organic disease of any description.”
I asked a few more necessary questions. Then,
in the evening, we fixed things up, and Carisford
told the girl that I was fit to go on in the morn-
ing. She came over to the edge of the verandah,
where I sat smoking, with my legs dangling.
“ D’you know,” she said, and leaned against
the post with her hands clasped behind her. “ I
b’lieve it’s quite true ’bout one man’s meat bein’
another man’s pizen. I been thinkin’ about
gettin’ my life insured for that long I don’t
remember. An’ here’s luck turnin’ up in your
cornin’ along an’ not goin’ off the hooks after all. ”
She looked so bright and strong and fresh, and
her laugh was so natural, that I marvelled.
“ Don’t you talk to Carisford about luck,” I
said. “He calls it Providence—with a big P.”
She glanced at Carisford where he humped
himself over the fire in the tin. For, despite his
leathery Skin, the mosquitoes bothered him
frightfully.
“ Stick yer fingers in yer ears,” she cried,
saucily. “ I’m tellin’ him as I’m the luckiest girl
£pin . I ain’t got nothin’ to trouble me now.”
I looked at the two idiots, sitting also on
the verandah-edge, dangling their legs and
smoking bits of stick in imitation of me. Her
eyes followed mine, and there was a great pride
in them.
“ They’re well-growed,” she said, as a mother
might speak of her babies. “ You wouldn’t think
as Sam Was on’y sixteen, would you ? An’ Micky,
he’s not much luore’n twenty. He did a fine
day’s work.,to-day, didn’t you, Micky ? ”
The thing nearest me lifted its shaggy head,
and I saw the gleam of teeth and eyes. He
growded add dropped his head forward again.
The girl tapped her foot, humming a little tune.
“ Can’t you give that doo. o’ yourn somethin’
to liven him up ? ” she whispered with twitching
lips. “ He’d sicken a turnip would that same
feller. .D’you know what he’d do wi’ a joke if he
saw one?”'. •
“Post-mortem it,” I said. “But he never
will see one; so it is quite safe.”
She laughed again. Indeed she was always
laughing,. and the last I saw of' her, as the trap
turned out of the gate, she was laughing still.
Either, side’of her stooddihe:(great hulking men who
should havedJeen he? protectors and her helpers
1 instead.of jaar.daily.clrk : But her face was glad
in the sunshine, and bright as the day itself, and
She sent a ringing coo-ee after us as we wheeled
into the .grey distance of the scattered gum-bush.
1 ‘ ‘ I’d like to know what her life will be like ten
years hence,” I said, getting the whip out.
Carisford. literally jumped on his seat. He
' slewed his great goggle eyes round on me, and I
' saw that hisifaoe was white,
i “ What’s wrong ? ” I demanded. “ Gone on
her yourself, eh? Carisford, life is too solemn ”
“ For the Lord’s sake, shut up,” said Carisford.
There a gulp in his voice, and he looked
; away again. And I held my tongue, for the road
was made of all the ungrubbed stumps in the dis-
trict, and the ho'rsps were fresh.
Two miles further on we came to a very decent
little humpy of the usual type. Carisford laid a
hand on my arm.
“ Pull up,” he said, “ I want to speak to the
man here.”
“ How the deuce d’you know it is a man ?” I
asked ; and then the man himself gave the answer
by 1 , coming down to the gate with three dogs
jurnping about him.
He was a fine-looking young fellow, decent and
clean as the humpy itself, and his tanned face was
honest and observant. Carisford tumbled out of
the trap in a heap, grabbed him by the shoulder
as he opened the gate, and spoke all in a hurry.
“ I want to have a few words with you,” he
said. “ The girl back there told me of you.”
I saw the young fellow’s skin burn suddenly.
He turned shamefaced and sheepish, and I grinned
to myself. But I was abnormally puzzled too.
Was Carisford going to bring those two together
by the scruffs of their necks ? He was capable of
trying. But neither the girl nor the young man
looked the kind to allow much of that sort of
'thing.
The horses were irritable with the flies and the
heat, and iA the bush the whir of the crickets was
worse than a saw-mill. I forgot the two for a
little, and when I looked at them again I saw
that they had forgotten me.
Carisford was gesticulating like a windmill, and
the young fellow was standing stiff as a rake,
with his hands clenched and hanging, and his
head up as though he looked straight before him.
I could not see his face. Carisford left him so,
rushing back to the trap in a frantic hurry, hurl-
ing himself in on top of me and jerking at the
reins.
“Come on,” he cried. “I’ve said enough.”
“ I should guess you had, by the look of
him,” I said, grimly. “ But I have never
known you own up to it before, Carisford.”
“ I said no more than I had to,” said Carisford,
thrusting his chin out and settling his glasses.
But I got from him no word of what he had
said until five months later, when we came back
to town and found out all that had been lost and
won and said since we went away.
I was going north alone on the morrow, but I
had Carisford to dinner with me in a quiet little
restaurant, because I wanted to ask him a question.
“ Carisford,” I said, when we were peeling our
bananas, “did you hear about that girl? She
died two months back.”
“Yes,” said Carisford, but he did not look
at me.
“ What a mercy for her that policy was taken
out,” I said. “ I wonder what she died of, poor
thing. She looked just life itself. I can’t believe
it yet, you know.”
“ She died of heart disease,” said Carisford,
raising his head.
“ W-what ? ” said I.
Carisford turned it into technical language for
me without a tremor. But I saw the sweat again
on his big-boned face.
“ I knew she had only a few months to live,”
he said. “So I lied, and gave her what she
wanted. I had to, you know. I never told her,
of course, but I told the chap at the next humpy.
He had wanted to marry her for years ; and he
kept an eye on her, and let me know when it
was over. The brothers are in a place near
Parramatta. I arranged that.”
He spoke without emotion. But, knowing
Carisford as I did, I understood something of
what this meant to him.
“I had to tell you,” he said. “I have con-
sidered myself a truthful man until now. But I
am a liar and a cheat, and the solemnity of
life is something past all believing. And yet —
though perhaps you may not understand me,
Perry—l am glad that I did it.”
“ Old man,” I said, and reached a hand to him
across the table; “I think you ought to be
climbing up your own back over this.”
Carisford shook his head, and his shoulders
stooped lower.
‘ ‘ I am not as good a man as I thought I was,
Perry,” he answered. “ I considered myself
absolutely truthful. But the woman tempted me,
and I fell. And the mischief of it is that lam
glad I fell.”
I have hopes of Carisford yet —if he comes
across another woman.

This new Patent Two=Plane Deck is the greatest improvement made in
Concentrators for very many years. The Deck is so constructed that
the lower corner can be raised by the adjusting
screw, and as this is where most mineral is

obvious. Any desired result may be obtained.
