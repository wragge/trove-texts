The Bulletin.
SATURDAY, JANUARY 19, 18S4.
Among the recommendations made by-
Messrs. Morris and Ranken, in their report
on the Land laws, a prominent place was
held by that which suggested that aliena-
tions of the fee-simple of country lauds
should be termimted by new legislation, and
that a system of leasing should be substi-
tuted in the future. That
is in harmony with modern economic policy,
and in that sense acceptable to all thorough
thinkers—that is to say, acceptable in the
abstract. That the State should be the uni-
versal landlord, and that the expenses of
Government should be derived from the soil
in the first place, are propositions which
have been, within the last few years, demon-
strated with extraordinary cogency, and
which have not been affected by the numer-
ous attempts which have been made to
impeach the principles and controvert the
logic of the demonstrators. Henry George
and Alfred Wallace have been answered,
indeed. But they have been answered with
just the same result as in the case of the
innumerable rejoinders to Bishop Colenso,
or Charles Darwin, or John Stuart Mill.
The replies are already extinct, and the
reasonings intended to be demolished are
entering steadily and surely into the cate-
gory of undeniable facts, and into th« con-
stitution of all men’s thoughts. There is
no gainsaying, for example, a demonstration
that the soil is as much a gift of the Creator
to mankind in common as is the air, and
that, as Herbert Spencer puls it—
“ Equity does not permit property in land, for if
one portion of the earth’s surface may justly be-
come the possession of one individual, and may be
held by him for his sole use and benefit as a thing
to which he has an exclusive use, then other por-
tions of the earth's surface may be so held, and
eventually the whole of the earth's surface may
be so held, and our planet may thus lapse alto-
gether into private hands. Observe now the
dilemma to which this leads. Supposing the entire
habitable globe to be so enclosed, it follows that if
the land-holders have a valid right to its surface,
all who are not land-owners have no right at all to
its surface. Hence, such can exist on the earth
by sutfrance only. They are all trespassers save
by permission of the ‘ lords of the soil ’; they can
have no room for the soles of their feet; nay,
should the others think fit to deny them a resting-
place, these landless men might equitably be ex-
pelled from the earth altogether.”
♦ * *
An argument and illustration applied in
the course of the debate on the second read-
ing of the Crown Lauds Bill, by Mr.
Combes, fits in very appositely with that
demonstration, and anticipates any such
reply as that, although this may be true in
general, and theoretically, it can have no
application to our circumstances, and, in
fact, involves no practical risk of being
realized anywhere. Mr. Combes, although
he did not, so far as we have been able to
understand him, appear to be very clear
why he dislikes the Government Bill, ex-
pressed himself on some points in a manner
which would have fully justified him in his
repugnance. He seems, however, while free
in laying down abstract principles and
adducing powerful illustrations, always
ready to run away from the conclusions
legitimately derivable from his facts and
instances. Thus Mr. Combes pointed out
that according to the scheme of the Land
Bill, in thematter of maximum areas allowed
to selectors, 50,000 persons would be able to
secure the whole surface of New South
Wallis! It is singular that this calculation,
although it prompted Mr. Combes to
denounce the idea as “ monstrous,” does not
dispose him to oppose alienation altogether.
With him it seems to be a matter of
arithmetic, a sum in proportion, rather than
a question of vital principle. So far as his
speech furnishes a clue to his real meaning—
which is not far—it would appear that if the
Government would reduce the maximum
area for selections, he would be content to let
the principle slide. In other words,that while
a plan which would partition the lands of
this colony among 50,000 owners appears to
him “monstrous,” he would be satisfied
with a scheme which would increase the
50 000 to. say, 100,000. Mr. Combes’s confusion
of mind is evidently due to defective study.
He is not master of the more recent dis-
coveries in the science of political economy,
and therefore stated—withoiitconsciousness
that it was a confession he was making, not
an argument he was using—that he “ could
understand the taxation of property, but a
proposal to tax land without taxing other
classes of property he could not understand.’’
The distinction Mr. Combes cannot under-
stand has been very clearly and specifically
explained by Henry George. A brief quo-
tation from the exhaustive demonstration
on this head by Mr, George will serve our
present purpose
“The real and natural distinction is between
thing’s which are the produce of labour and things
which are the gratuitous offerings of nature; or,
to adopt the terms of political economy, between
wealth and land. These two classes of things are
in essence and relations widely different, and to
class them together as property is to confuse all
thought when we come to consider the justice or
the injustice, the right or the wrong, of property.”
Thus to tax other sorts of property might
operate to discourage individual exertion
and enterprise, but for the State to tax land,
either when admitting private property in
the soil and adopting the cognate expedient
of a progressive land tax, or refusing to
sanction private ownership and collecting
in the style of rent the difference between
what is yielded by the actual soil and what
is due to exertion, could have no such
effect.
* * *
Mr. Copeland argued this matter with a
better comprehension than Mr. Combes, but
at the same lime did not, we think, show
sufficient appreciation of the fundamental
principles. While he showed a perfect ap-
preciation of the evils and dangers of large
monopoly, he missed the equal significance
of a class monopoly on a more extended and
distributed scale. His argument, in fact,
was directed more against great monopoly
than against monopoly in itself. He would
be content to have the colony owned by the
50,000 landed proprietors calculated by Mr.
Combes, although his mind revolts at the
prospect of a vast proportion being owned
by 500 great proprietors. He propounded
a preventive check. While prepared to
accept the maximum area permitted to
selectors by the Government bill — 1380
acres in the Eastern, and 3560 acres in
the Central division—he would, with the
view of preventing the accumulation of
large estates and the overgrowth of land-
lordism, impose a perpetual condition of
residence on each such area. In other word?,
he would make the condition of residence
attach to the selection, and not to the selector
as heretofore. The State ought, Mr. Cope-
land thinks, to insist on these areas main-
taining at least one settler, with his wife and
family, in perpetuity. The original settler,
or any subsequent proprietor, should be at
liberty to sell; but the new proprietor would,
on entering into possession, come under the
obligation of residence.
• • •
Mr. Copeland prefers this plan to the more
sweeping proposals of the modern school of
politico-economists, because he believes the
latter runs counter to a deep-rooted human
instinct. It is his impression that there is no
sufficient reason why every man should not
be his own landlord. Replying to an inter-
ruption by Mr. Buchanan, who interjected
that every man does not want to be a land-
lord, Mr. Copeland asserted that he had
never found a person who did not feel that
desire. In this dispute, we are disposed to
consider that Mr. Copeland has the ad-
vantage. The unexplained but understood
question was not absolute but comparative.
It is true that not every man wishes to be a
landlord, because many men are content to
pass through life without direct dealings
with land. But Mr. Copeland was con-
sidering the inclinations of mankind when
choosing between a leasehold and a free-
hold. Obviously the freehold tenure has
many attractions which a leasehold one
does not present, and he would be a very
exceptional man who would not, if he were
occupying or using laud at all, prefer
ownership absolute and in perpetuity to a
conditional and limited proprietorship. But
the essential question in this case, as in so
many others, is not confined to the instinc-
tive lusts of the individual. It turns upon
a much superior principle. It is whether
these innate desires can be indulged without
infringing the rights and injuring or re-
stricting the birth-right of others. It is not,
in fact, a question of indulging instincts,
but of balancing advantages. There are
numbers of other aspirations which actuate
every individual, but which could only be
indulged by sacrificing the many to the few.
There is the lust of power, of conquest, of
ease, of sexual gratification—all these and
many other powerful instincts; but every
one of them recognised as inimical to the
common weal, and in frequent instances
held in check by special and severe re-
strictions. To adduce a universe
cannot, therefore, be accepted as equivalent
to proving the propriety of satisfying that
desire.
V • •
Mr. Copeland regards actual nationali-
sation of the land as impracticable. Now,
we believe in nationalisation of the land ;
but we, too, regard it as impracticable—at
present. And especially as impracticable In
this colony and other territories similarly
circumstanced as regards the proportion of
population to area. But, for almost identi-
cal reasons, we regard Mr. Copeland’s own
proposals as impracticable. The people as
a body are not educated up to either alter-
native. And here they are not stung by
bitter want and craving earth-hunger into
the sort of desperate envy which creates an
instinct of re-distribution as a substitute for
the deliberate philosophy which diagnoses
the symptoms of that craving, which can
predict its occurrence by observation of pre-
disposing causes and conditions, and which
would fain avert violent inflammations from
the body-politic by correcting beforehand
the abuses of the system. In radical reforms
of agrarian systems it will not be the thinly-
peopled colonies which wHl lead the way

Nothing short of the tremendous impulse
imparted by suffering and deprivation will
suffice to break down the resistance of vested
advantage and the immobility of-unreason
which bolster up the evil but deep-rooted
system of private property in, and monopoly
of, land. The change will not be accom-
plished by a triumph of reason, but by a
burst of passion and despair; and here,
thank Heavens, conditions of life are yet so
easy that neither the passion nor the despair
have the putrid soil to grow in, which is
necessary for them as for some abnormal
sorts of fungi, and which only the concen-
trate! abuses of power and opportunity,
festering for centuries in old communities,
can provide.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Address to Lord Rosebery.
It was drafted by the City Solicitor, but then the
aldermen passed it unanimously, and are equally
responsible for its nonsense and its bathos. The
Municipal address to the Earl of Rosebery is
what we are talking about just now. Of course,
at the very outset, we admit the right of any man
or body of men to make donkeys of themselves, if
they are so disposed. We don’t mind a bit being
fired into the mud ourselves—what we really do
object to is having it rubbed in. We elect aider-
men to keep our streets clean and attend generally
to the well-being of the city. When they neglect
these things, as they generally do, we indulge in
the hereditary right to grumble, but seldom rebel.
It is quite another thing, however, when they step
out of their proper vocation, do things which are
not in their bond, and impudently assert that in
doing so they still represent the citizens. This
address to Lord Rosebery, offered “ in the name
of our fellow-citizens,” is just one of those things
that induce us to arch our backs and look ugly. It
is a piece of flunkeylsm from beginning to end.
It reads like a chapter out of the “Book of
Snobs”:—“We are deeply sensible of the honour
which we receive from the presence in our midst
of one who is a member of that distinguished
Assembly whose deliberations in conjunction with
the House of Commons, and under the guidance
of Her Majesty the Queen, direct the affairs of the
vast empire of which our colony forms part.” Is
this an extract from the “ Court Circular,” or a
State paper to be preserved in the archives of a
democratic city ? “In conjunction with the House
of Commons I” Phew! The House where all the
power resides is put in in a patronising, half-
fipologetic way, as if the “ City Solicitor ” just re-
membered in time that a word might bo said for it
also. It suggests old drummer Pierre when re-
lating the prowess of his ancestor, a long defunct
drummer:—
“ My grandsire was ever victorious,
My grandsire and Monsieur Turenne.”
The “deliberations” of the Lords or the “guid-
ance ” of Her Majesty have just about as much
potency in moulding English institutions, or direct-
ing “the affairs of the vast Empire,” as the reso-
lutions of the Sydney Municipal Council in keeping
the Russians behind the Balkans, or the French
out of Madagascar. Again :—“ But whilst as a
member of the House of Lords you claim our
homage and respect, as a man you have won
our esteem and admiration.” Thus, to obtain the
“homage" of the aldermen and citizens of Syd-
ney, it is only necessary to be a lord. So, while
the veteran Bright, backed up by the advanced
Liberalism of England, declares that the absurdity
of hereditary lawmakers cannot much longer be
tolerated in a free and progressive state—while
English Radicalism is clamouring for representa-
tion, and vowing whe»; it succeeds to make short
work of hereditary distinctions and hereditary
legislators—the Mayor and Aldermen of
“in the name of our fellow-citizens,” are tender-
ing their “ homage ” to a visitor, not because he is
an able man, but because he belongs to a class
considered by philosopher, politician, and peasant
a mischievous anachronism !
The Value of Statistics.
“ The progress of the working classes in England
during the last half century” was the subject of
Mr. Gif fen’s Inaugural address to the Statist’caj
Society, in London. Mr. Giffen is President of the
Society, and is considered an able statistician. He
proves, with “ irresistible logic,” that the work-
man of to-day earns Just double as much as his
grandfather 60 years ago; that, instead of the rich
becoming richer and the poor poorer, almost the
converse has been the case, as the wealth of the
rich has remained nearlv stationary, while that of
the poor—if the term “ wealth ” can be applied
without incongruity to the savings of the latter—
has increased by leaps and bounds. Mr. Giffen
says:—“ The poor have had almost all the benefit
of the great material advance of the last 50 years.”
It has been amongst those who receive wages, and
not those who pay, that the accumulation has been
most marked. He warns his hearers against toying
with the specious doctrines of Communism and
Socialism; and shows that the accumulation of
capital, even in a few hands, is more advantageous
to the labourer than to the capitalist “The war
of the land nationallser and Socialist is not so much
with the capitalist as with the workman, and the
Importance of this fact should not be lost sight of .’>
This is a pleasant picture, drawn by one who had
all the materials at hand for making a correct
one. But is it correct? Is it a fact that the
British workman is in the enviable position repre-
sented by the President of the Statistical Society?
The slums of London, Liverpool, Manchester, and
Glasgow ; the poor-houses scattered through
Great Britain ; the agricultural labourer eking
out an existence on 10s. a week, supplemented by
an occasional dole from the squire, the parson, or
the parish ; the constant stream of emigration
Westward ; the millions who squat on the border
line separating poverty from actual want—all
meet the statement with a fiat denial. Some well-
known journalists are at present engaged in
giving an account of their experiences among the
poor of East London These experiences were
obtained not from books or State papers ; not
from tables of imports or exports, returns of
bullion in the vaults of the Bank of England, or
learned treatises on the balance of trade and
tightness of the money market, but from actual
observations on the spot. It is not too much to
say that the abjectness of the misery they disclose
is simply appalling—misery not confined to a few
thousands, but affecting millions with sullen dis-
content towards the laws which secure the well-
being of the few at the expense of the many. The
conditions under which these people live are
destructive of all manliness in men—all woman-
liness in women. The moral foulness of
their lives is in keeping with the material
foulness of their dons. Among them the
crimes that brought destruction on the Cities of
the Plain are too common to attract attention.
Alleys reeking with garbage, houses mildewed
with damp, rooms foetid with filth, tell the story
of their lives from year to year. Nor is ail this
characteristic of London alone, but of every large
town in Great Britain. To point out to such
people the increase in the national wage fund, and
warn them against Socialism and Communism, is
surely the cruellest mockery. The assertion that
it is advantageous to a nation to have its capital or
its land in a few hands, is contradicted by every
in the history of every country. It is this
very question, not of the vast accumulation of
wealth, but of its proper distribution so as to
place within the reach of all the potentiality of
leading decent lives, that is at the bottom of those
ominous murmurs of discontent whose reverbe-
rations from time to time reach even our shores.
So far as private property in land is concerned,
Groat Britain stands first among leading nations
for the-we might say—iniquity of its system.
But even this question of land distribution is
overshadowed by the greater one behind it—the
question that, in spite of the speculations of
economists or the tables of statisticians, is making
its way to the front, and will not be denied—the
question of the distribution of wealth, or the re-
lation between labour and capital.
The S. Daily Telegraph, in an ultra-Podsnap-
pish leader on the Soudan difficulty, remarks:—
“ What does appeal powerfully to the humanity of
Christendom is the allegation that the erection
of the Soudan into an independent kingdom or
republic will give a new lease of life to the slave
trade of North Africa. ‘A renunciation of the
Soudan,’ says Mr. Broadley, ‘also means the
complete triumph of the slave dealers and their
infamous traffic.’ This is a possible triumph which
angers every Briton.” The Briton (who never,
never, never will be a slave—when he is half-
drunk at a music-hall) is naturally angered at the
bare possibility of the people of the Soudan having
the right to wollop their own niggers. Slave trade
abominations can be viewed from more than one
standpoint. There is the Exeter Hall platform,
and also that of the wretched, down-trodden
Briton, who (thanks to the political outcome of
Jingoistic proclivities and operations in the past)
has, in reality, ever, ever, over been involved in
the meshes of a blacker complexion of slavery
than ever was dreamed of in his least hopeful
moments by the most imaginative darkie in the
Soudan.
A “ROMAN" WRESTLE.
It was a dull, sluggish afternoon—the kind
of day that makes her, at the moment of the
arrival of the Coogee tram (for which you have
been waiting an hour), look doubtfully up at the
heavens, Unger significantly her hat, and change
the programme to the Arcades and QuongTart.
Great resorts, these tea-shops; and when you enter
no one seems surprised to see you, but indignation
at your advent is stamped on the faces of all.
They seem to be saying under their breaths,
“What in thunder ,”and to stop themselves
with a scone. Rut Quong (it is impossible to call
him, with any gravity, "Mr. Tart”) is one Celes-
tial smile, and, when not weighed down by the
affairs of the State in his new capacity as Adviser
to the Government, will chat pleasantly with you
about either the military condition of China or the
intricacies of the noble game of “ heading ’em,”
as interpreted by the Manganese. He is, like
Trotty Veci’s last week’s paper, “ full of informa-
tion.” And tea, on a Saturday afternoon when
she is with you, leads to other thingS-peppermint
drops, gloves, lemon-squash, and, perchance, jew-
ellery. ' It was the dullness of the weather that
made us think of the Arcades. They are splendid
places in which to study human nature. We have
haunted them in quest of jokes, until we have
attracted the attention of the beadles; and we
were unable, on one occasion, to mollify a sus-
picious storekeeper by a moderate investment in
pea-nuts. Funny shops! They seem to sell every-
thing you don’t want, and everything your girl
does. The one that always interests us is that
little emporium in which everything seems to be a
shilling, excepting the young lady who dispenses
the stock, and she appears to be piceless.
But, let us get on. We have seen matinees of all
kinds and in all countries. We remember, years
ago, a crazy old diorama that set forth the adven-
tures of the Duke of Wellington, or Garden
Honey, or someone, in which “ every child used to
receive a present.” And while the proprietors
were readying up the tin whistles, a feeble old
party was wont to sing some obsolete comic song
about
“ A tinker and a tailor and a soldier and a sailor,
And a swell who used to talk about bis pa and
his ma;”
playing an accompaniment to it that was solely
and completely his own. A bull-tight is a good
matinda-draw. We remember at the last one we
attended in Lima, the bull contrived to kill a
favourite picador; and it is still fresh in our
memory how, when he was taken to “his late
residence,” we shared in the popular rejoicing.
(These little reminiscences, wo take it, make
cheerful and seasonable firelight reading). But
the people here don’t get any bull-fights, and are,
as a rule, lottnto turn out in the middle of the day.
Foley’s tight was a great event, it is true; but it
was not thought amongst the talent that Miller
and Victor would, at their struggle, have “more
than a million in.” Strange to say, however,
there was a good roll-up, the gallery being
crowded, the dress-circle fair, but the monstrous
price of the stalls proved a great deal too
stiff for the “ fancy.” It was a pound to go
on the stage, and the attendance there was,
so far as numbers wont, eminently satisfactory.
Laurence Foley, Esq., was present, and Signor
Verdi, and Professor D’Harcourt, and Dave
Ingram, Fsq., all of whom, doubtless, contributed
liber-ally to the treasury! The Punches, strange
to say, were only represented by Steve; but the
dapper Deeble, hls“pardner,”wasnot absent from
the fray. And we must not forget Clark (of C.
and K.), whose opinion of this country, if not
flattering, at least is forcible. The'pros, were in
great force. There were the “funny, very,”
duettists, who don’t look a bit funny off the
stage: and the whole was pervaded by the irre-
pressible Goodie. Wo were all seated in a semi-
circle, like a nigger-minstrel troupe that had lost
its wardrobejand run out of burnt cork! It was
a pretty convivial gathering; and as the company,
during the wrestle, went out five separate times
to get a drink, towards the close of the entertain-
ment many of the stage-spectators bordered
closely oo toe hilarious,
Prior to the commencement of the show»
we had a bit of an interview with Mons. Victor-
He is a lithe Frenchman, of medium height, with
no physique to speak of ; and the fact ot
his having the National rapid utterance
causes him to be the very antithesis ot
Miller, who possesses, if not the humour,
at least the concentration of the eyster. Yet, in
spite of M. Victor’s slim appearance, he comes to
us with his bright little record. He is, we see,
“ Champion Middle-weight Graeco-Roman Wrestler
of Australia, and .holder of the Champion Gold
Medal of France,” —no less! Well, despit j of this
announcement, as we gazed at and conversed wth
Victor, the thing uppermost in our mind was not
how often Miller would throw his opponent, but
in what direction he would throw him; over how
many rows of stalls M. Victor would go; in what
part ot the dress circle he would most frequently
alight, and how many people would be killed in
the gallery by his flying corse.
• • •
It is part of the playful nature of these
athletes to call their entertainment a Gnoco-
Ronaan wrestle. Very instructive! This makes
us wonder what these .esthetic athletes would dub
a dog-flght or how denominate a chicken-tussle.
At something after three o’clock. Miller stepped
out on to the carpet—which had a layer of sawdust
beneath it—looking a picture. He was naked to
the waist, and wore white and red tights; while
the Frenchman mounted white and blue. When
Victor showed up, quite a murmur of mingled
astonishment and sympathy was heard in the
theatre. He stripped very badly, and was
plainly out of condition. Long before his
first fall, he was a river of perspiration, and
kept uttering now and again a croak like that
made by a very hoarse raven. Now you shall
hear, all you that say your prayers regularly, what
the Graeco-Roman wrestling is really like. In the
first place, gentle (and wo are sure patient) reader,
Miller having undertaken to throw Victor flat on
his back five times in one hour, all the latter s
troubles consisted in keeping on the defensive,
and lying on his stomach as much as possible. 1 he
thing, thus resolved itself into the following pas-
time. Directly the men would close, down would go
Victor on the carpet, with Miller on the top of
him, upon which the champion would twist him,
bend him, lift him, clutch him by the threat, roll
him —in fact, do everything to him but eat him.
This “entertainment” lasted usually from eight to
eleven minutes, when, on a “ fall ” being declared,
the panting pair would retire to their rooms. On
these occasions, Victor presented a pitiable spec-
tacle. His face being nearly all the time buried
in the carpet, his mouth when he got up was usu-
ally so full of sawdust, and grit, and fluff, and
carpet dye, that, when bespoke, his voice sounded
like a distant foghorn. There was no band, so the
proceedings were initiated by a few words from
the referee; an arrangement which, when it is
considered that Larry Foley was amongst the
audience, is strangely unaccountable. George
Merriman, M.P., whs up in the dress-circle, and it
was rumoured that he had been requested to set
the ball rolling, but had courteously declined. It
seems that some years ago George, who had lust
come from Court, was asked to “look after a
well-known pugilist in a boxing-match at Larry’s,
and also to make a little speech. Being a bit con-
fused, he blurted out the following: “ Gentlemen,
I appear for the defendant here, in this ease, and
I shall put it in evidence before you. that the word
of the girl is not to be believed.” He then buried
his flushed features in a foaming goblet.
« • *
Some of the bouts were very severe, and
Victor must have felt considerably incommoded
at those times when Miller's knee was in the small
of his back, and the giant’s great fingers squeezing
bis neck. This is, it seems, allowed, and was pro-
bably invented by the Grmco-Romans. Sounding
smacks unon the bare back and sides are also per-
mitted ; in fact, the only things that seem to be
outside the rules are ear-chowing and the use of
a bludgeon. It must bv said of Victor that what
he lacked in strength he made up in activity, fall-
ing, when thrown, like a cat, on all fours, and fre-
quently getting away from his adversary. But, it
was dreary work withal, and during the contest
certain wits whiled away the time by offering, and
taking jocose wagers for enormous sums, “that
the Frenchman would do him.” Of course the
Frenchman didn't do him, and Miller accomplished
the fifth fall within seven minutes of the hour, a
conclusion that was perfectly satisfactory to all.

Canterbury Park bids fair to be the
suburban rendezvous of the snorting world, and
the committee are doing all in their power to
make next Saturday's racing meet a success. A
large number [of ’buses will meet all trains to
Ashfield, and convey visitors to the gates. The
racing course describes an oval, and, as far as
position is concerned, is no doubt the most prettily
situated course outside the metropolis. A sprint-
ing track 400 feet long has been prepared for peds.,
a cricket ground is in course of preparation; and,
if the club continues as well as it has begun, the
patronage of the public will be assured.
Certain cricketers would like to know,
you know, how It is that Ogilvie, of the Warwick
C.(J , has not been selected for N.S.W. Fifteen v.
Australian Eleven. Some suggest (but this can’t
be true) that owing to the prominent part he has
taken in certain reforms in the Cricket Association
he is paying the penalty. His average with a
senior club this season happens to be thirty-five
wickets for about eight runs a wicket, but this
does not seem to be good enough. The selection
committee evidently prefer bowlers with an
average of twenty or thirty runs a wicket to up-
hold the honour of N.8. Wales in the cricket field.
On Saturday last the cricketers were busy.
1 he Oriental and Our Boys started their match for
the Stedman Cup, on the Cup wickets, Moore Park.
Our Boys scored 115 in their first tnnings-Crisp
15, Yarley39, Middleton 26; and the Orientals lost
three wickets for 80-Pride 31. Luland 31 (not out).
Donnelly 6 (notout). The AVarwick and Carltons
also started a match for the Holdsworth Cup, on
the Association Cricket Ground. The Carltons
were all disposed of for 120. Bannerman 36. Tur-
ner 15, Nunn 16, Callachor 28; and at the call of
time the AVarwicks had lost one wicket for 86.
Gregory 13. Davis (not out) 30, G. Sale (nOt out)
40. The Carlingford-Belvidere match, for the
Gardiner Cup, came to a conclusion very much in
favour of the Belvideros. The scores were—Car-
lingford, first innings, 63, second 96 ; and the Bei-
viderc, first, 129, and three wickets for 32 in the
second. On the Wentworth Park Cricket Associ-
ation’s ground, a combined;! welve of the Corio
and Osborne clubs easily defeated ihe first Alberts,
the latter being weakened by the absence of D.
Gregory, Massie and Moses. The Alberts scored
62 in the first Innings to their opponents’ 112. The
following players have been chosen to practice
for selection against the Australian Eleven, who
will oppose fifteen of New South Wales on the
25th, 26th, and 2Sth of January : —Allen, Bryant,

PERSONAL ITEMS.
A correspondent informs us that we were
mistaken iit stating’ that Sir Capel Fitzgerald mar-
ried a love child, and never knovv her parentage.
Our correspondent gives the name and family ot
the lady whom the baronet married, to her subse-
quent sorrow.
Robert Carter, the incarcerated insolvent,
must do his time. His petition for release has been
before the Victorian Chief Just'ce and the Solicitor-
General. and neither sees any reason why ho should
cease to dine in Melbourne gaol. We generally
pity a man when he has been a while in gaol, we
would bo inclined to let out lota of people after
we had vindicated the majesty of the law by
putting them in. Somehow, when we have them
in, we begin to say to ourselves that there are so
many every bit as bad not in, that the poor devil
ought to be out with the rest. But we are not the
Victorian Solicitor-General, and so Carter must
do his time. It may bo as well —for if he were
out, he might be doing his creditors. Better go on
doing his time.
Mrs. Potts, M.D., who lately told us some
cheerful physiological facts concerning alcohol
and tobacco, has been ordered by the Medical
Board of Victoria to take in her sign. She may be
—probably is—entitled to lly M.D. from her mast-
head; but, not having registered iu Victoria and
paid tho usual fee, the “scientists” (Lord forgive
us) of that colony have decided that her trade-
mark is not genuine. We await with anxiety the
Potts’ answer to this aspersion by the kettle. We
know the Medical Board of Victoria. Some of the
members could nearly do long division, and one or
two of them have heard toat tho earth is round;
but these cases are exceptional. We shall see
whether the screaming American Eagle will bo
put down by this little colonial bantam.
Thus a telegram, dated Qundagai, Wed-
nesday, January 9, to tho S.D. Telegkaph ‘ Dr.
Marshall, Government medical officer for this dis-
trict, is to be presented shortly with a handsome
claret jug.” The Italics in above are ours. And
thus tho Gcndaqai Times of January 8, in its
report of tho proceedings on the Monday pre-
vious before the local Court of Quarter Sessions:
—“Dr. Marshall (calle-l by a prisoner for tho de-
fence), under cross-examination : I am on the
register of medical practitioners of this colony.
The Crown Prosecutor handed in to His Honor tho
Gazette containing a list of medical practitioners
for 1883, but there was no ‘ Henry Morton Mar-
shall ’ on that list.” But what of “ Dr.” Marshall s
name not being on the list of medical practi-
tioners, so long as he is a Government medical
ollloer ? He deserves his (claret) jug.
We believe that we know the reason why
some Australian Judges have such a down on the
Press, is because they are conscious that tneir
family history is not conducive to respect tor
them by any one who believes in the theory that
moral qualities are transmitted from parents to
sons, just as physical likenesses are, and they live
in terror lest some journalist may open the doors
of the cupboards in which their family skeletons
are hid. Just as if everything that relates to pro-
minent men were not universally known. 1 er-
haps, if some Judges wore fully aware how gener-
ally their little “secrets” are discussed, and how
their cupboard skeletons are made to dance jigs at
all sorts of odd times, they would have sense
enough to understand that the more ’ side thoy
put on, and th* haughtier their tone about the
purity of their souls and the delicacy of their
honour, the more fantastically ridiculous they
make themselves appear.
Among the passengers to arrive by the
mail steamer from ’Frisco is T. D. M Kay, the
celebrated general passenger agent for the Bur-
lington and Do Quincy railways. Every Australian
who has passed through ’Frisco knows M Kay.
He pervaded arriving steamers, and adopted the
largest families without a spasm, and sent them
on determined to travel by his railroad as his par-
ticular friends, with special privUeges noyer
before enjoyed by any traveller. T. D. M Kay is
tho smartest of living passenger agents, and is
going to do a business tour of tho colonies. If
Stuart doesn’t | look sharp, M‘Kay will tow the
colony across tho Pacific, and the whole
population spinning across the Great Continent in
palace cars, every man woman and child pene-
trated with a conviction that M Kay had arranged
matters specially to suit tho convenience of him-
self and no other passenger.
Sir Salmon may be said to have got For-
tune “by the wool,” or, more correctly, by his
own wool. He has purchased, for £306,000, the
Osmaston Manor Estate, in Derbyshire. As the
house and grounds (to Avhich costly additions
have been made) originally cost £300,000, and the
rent-roll is now nearly £6000 a year, this is evi-
dently the proper manor to make money. It is a
lovely place, sacred to the memory of Walton and
Cotton, of Rousseau and Darwin, of Johnson and
Boswell (Dovedale was the Valley of
“ Rasselas”), of Wordsworth and Tom Moore (May-
field Cottage, where “ Those Evening Bells —
Ashbourne bells—was written, is in Dovedale),
and of many another dead and gone genius.
Doubtless the associations of the place will Induce
Sir Samuel to drop into poetry. If thoy do, we
may so >n bo called upon to criticise a gorgeously
bound and exceedingly hot-pressed O ie to Ration
Tea.” We’re ready.
Doctors Hinohcliff, Boyd, and M'Gillivray
—three wide-awake Sandhurst professionals—were
lately “got at” by an innocent-looking slab of a
fellow, by means of false cheques. He first inter-
viewed Hinchcliff with a £5 draft and a hundred-
weight of dyspepsia. Ho received a draught in
exchange for his and £1 10s. change. Then ho
sidled towards M‘Gillivray’8 fortress with incipient
delirium tremens. There he got doubtful medi-
cine, souud advice, and £3 9s. 6d. in exchange for a
£4 cheque. When he meandered down to
“Jimmy” Boyd, at View Point, he laboured
under a severe oppression of the chest, with well-
marked pulmonary symptoms, a touch of Bright’s
disease, some tooth-ache, and a strong smell of
alcohol. It was a £3 bill this time, but the wily
“ James ” gave him his own note of hand for £3 7s.,
and made the difference up in coppers. When a
person now presents a cheque to any of these saw-
bones, he is kept chewing bread pills in the wait-
ing room, while the servant girl goes out the back
way for a couple of policemen and a rope.
Dick Ford, who is to be third railway com-
missioner in Victoria, was employed as a clerk in
the Liverpool Harbour Trust, and left England
when a young man. In Vietoria, he roughed it
like the rest, and could bring a bullock whip
handle along the ribs of a brindle off-polcr with
here and there a one—not to mention his neat
voicing of words of encouragement when the
wheels wore down to the axle in a crab-hole He
became legal manager for some mining claims in
Ballarat, and got the city clerkship. When the
Harbour Trust wanted a man, ho recollected
having been in a Harbour Trust office in his
youth, and his friend. Major Smith, mentioned his
name in his little insinuating way, and Dick got
tho appointment. Recently, it will be seen, he
has recollected having travelled on rai 1 ways a good
deal, and is once more “ in it.” If the Governor-
ship ot Victoria were in tho gift of tho Govern-
ment, he would have been up at Government
House before this, projecting the changes he would
make in old Normauby’s establishment as soon as
that Viceroy was outside Hodsou's Bay.
1 he wealth of the late Lord Overstone is
estimated at between 12 and 20 million pound*.
Few men have so successfully combined theo y
with practice in their money affairs. For years he
was acknowledged ihe greatest authority on
finance in England, and many times advised the
Government at crit'cal moments. He pricked the
bubble of paper-money scheming. He was of
Welsh parentage, a lover of art and pictures, and
was rich from his birth. His father left him
£3,000,000 some Duffy years ago. The fact that
such an eminent monetarist! was strongly against
the introduction of decimal coinage is worth
noting. The will of Lord Overstone leaves £6,000,000
to his daughter. And to prevent any im passioned
youth rushing into error, wo may add that tho
said daughter was married 25 years ago. Latterly,
tprd Overstone became imbued with the crank
that he was In danger of ending his days in poverty.
A story is told about his economy. Having a
visitor to dine, a pair of fowls formed the staple
of the meal, served on dishes of silver. Lord
Overstone carved one; and when the course was
removed, with the other fowl untouched, he said
to the servant, in a tone of remonstrrnce, “ I told
you one would bo enough to roast.”
The Hon. J. B. Patterson, of Victoria, was,
in the early days, a butcher at Castlemdne; but
he managed to creep into the good graces of the
Wesleyans and Methodists, and by their aid got
into Parliament, where he proved hinjself a very
useful representative. He has ever since held a
seat for Castlemalne. Ho was twice a Minister
under the Berry regime— for Works and for Hall-
ways—and is said to have been one of the chief
advisers of the Black Wednesday episode. Then
he became an auctioneer in Melbourne, where he
rapidly made his pile, and has now departed on a
trip tor the old country. Ho is an excellent
speaker, possesses great rugged intelligence, and
has good administrative ability. Latterly he has
taken up Parkes’s r6le, and has several times tried
to arouse a No-Popery cry; but, somehow or the
other, that cock won’t fight in Victoria like it does
In N.S. Wales. Patterson’s attack on Kedmond
and Forbes was a very safe one to make, consider-
ing that the objects of it are now thousands of
miles away from Australia. Why did he not try
it on while they were here ? On one occasion,
when being basted by Davy Gaunson about some
of his early transactions, J. B. P. tried to stop his
assailant by bursting into tears, and has ever since
been known as Crocodile Patterson.
After hunting around for him for a hun-
dred years they hive at last found the man “ who
struck Billy Patterson.” Not exactly the man
either, because he is dead, but his descendants.
Billy Patterson was struck in a Georgia saloon, in
1783, by a man called Tillerton. He didn’t see who
struck him, and ho was so mad tnat nobody dared
tell him. He offered 1000 dollars reward for the
information. He died without getting it, but the
sum was left in his will to the informer. The other
day a grand-daughter of Tillerton applied for it,
and produced proofs. Here is a queer thing.
Burke, Pitt, Washington—all were alive then. The
American Revolution was not long over, and the
seeds of the great French Revolution were stir-
ring. Europe slept and dreamt not of Napoleon.
The tornado of lire and steel that was to sweep
over her was in the phantasmal future. The red day
of Waterloo was a generation off. Yet all these
great men and terrible events came, passed, and
have been almost forgotten, while the memory of
an obscure row, in an obscure saloon, in what was
then an obscure country, has been preserved by a
phrase as fresh as ever. Why, at this fate, even
the speeches of Spicer, the doings of Lucas, may be
remembered when the words of clever men—our-
selves, for instance—are buried in musty oblivion.
It is this thought that disheartens us so often
when we are in the very critical throes of sublime
composition. We are consoled, however, by one
reflection—posterity has no money now, and wo
want money. Always.
Now, this is a very funny case, and we
intend to be very careful and delicate in putting it
before you. See how soberly we commence.
Mrs. Hudson, of Illinois, ran away from her hus-
band and her two children, took off her petticoats,
put on pants and the name of Frank Dubois, and
altogether acted the part of a young man. Most
young men, at some period, think themselves
capable of doing a bit of courting, furthermore
marrying, and even proceeding to carry out cer-
tain biblical precepts concerning multiplication.
And, in some cases, subsequent circumstances
show them to have been justified in their original
ideas. Well, it seems that Mrs. Hudson, or Frank
Dubois, got hold of the same ideas to some extent,
and proceeded to carry them out. She courted a
girl in Wisconsin, named Gertrude Fuller, and
married her, a clergyman performing the ceremony
in due form. Few young women proceed so far as
this in an unexpected direction, but as far as we can
learn even this peculiar person did not go any
further in the programme indicated. In another
direction, however, she did what a good few men
don’t; she went to work and supported her
“ wife,” Gertrude. Whether Gertrude was en-
tirely pleased with her efforts, we are unable to
state; but a break-up of the household Avas a few
months later caused by Mr. Hudson appearing on
the scene and announcing “ Frank ” to be his Avife
and mother of his children. It is hardly necessary
to say that this novel announcement excited some
interest in the public mind, and profoundly im-
pressed both sexes Avith a strong idea of something
or other.
As little Alfonso of Spain seems likely
to retire from business is King, he is more than
usually interesting. Even in Mercedes’ time, with
all the romance attached to it, there Avas a “ Blue
Beard’s or better still—a “ black-eyed ’ cham-
ber in the Palace of the Escurial, and it Avas
noticed that the king took, considering his age
(more than 20l, quite a feverish interest in circuses.
But his subjects like him all the better for that.
Look at poor Amadeo I He waa never known to
be oiit late, or to neglect the cosy little voal Outlet
with the Queen before they sought the regal four-*
poster. Yet they wouldn’t look at him, and in a
few short months ho had, whfen the shades of
night hits fallen, to do what Louis Philippe ac-
complished so expeditiously, “the band-box and
bird-cago trick. ,r Thefe’s no morality in Spain ;
and so it wasjj’t because of her giddy propensities
that Alfonso’s mother had to cord her Saratoga,
but because she made the mistake—the same one
Queen Caroline did, by the way—of promoting
her courier to the position of her Grand Chamber-
lain. Marfori was the gentleman, but wo rather
suspect Her Majesty has had a good many changes
In the personnel of her household since then!
Alfonso was a gay youth even-when Prince of the
Asturias ; and there was a rumour current that he
and the poor Prince Imperial had a fight at Wool-
wich one day, over an attractive “brandy-snap ”
retailer. There is one thing certain. The first
place he asked to be taken to when he paid his
farewell visit to London was The Coal Hole I This
is a matter of history. If, however, we should be
mistaken for once, we shall bo happy to afford
Alfonso space in these columns to make a correc-
tion. He needn’t mind writing in Spanish. There
is a German pianoforte-tuner quite near at hand.
He’ll pull us through.
It is seldom the fact of being respectable
necessitates anyone having to starve as a conse-
quence ; but such a thing actually nearly occurred.
Prank Miller was a bank clerk in this colony—wo
need not particularise—and he married a sweet
and pretty Australian woman. Troubles and
changes took them to England, and thence they
took passages tor Now York. At the last moment,
their luggage had not come on board, Miller wont
to see after it, was detained, and the ship sailed.
Mrs. Miller was distracted as to what to do, but
knowing their scanty moans would not permit the
loss of their passage, she went on board, crying
bitterly. A week later, without a friend, clothing,
or a pound, she was landed in Now York. In two
days, she was penniless. She called on the police;
they would do nothing, as she was not a criminal.
She called at several Homes for Friendless Women;
they would not take her in, because she was not a
fallen woman. She sat in public squares, and was
Insulted by lustful men. On the verge of starva-
tion, she was saved by one of her own sex, who
Save her shelter and went to inquire about her
usband. He had sailed in the Canada, which was
wrecked, was picked up by the Scotia, and was due
in a day or so. When the Scotia was telegraphed,
the tired wife went down to the quay, and. with
tear-brimming eyes, watched the stately ship’s
slow, unsteady approach. At the same time, lean-
ing- on the railing- of the ship's side was a fair-
faced, light-haired young chap, who watched with
eager eyes the little group on the dock. The ship
came nearer and nearer, until it was ten feet from
the dock, when suddenly, above the din incident
to the arrival of a ship, rang ioud and clear the;
one word, “FrankI” and in an instant the fair-"
haired young m«n sprang on top of the rail upon
which he had been leaning, and with one soul-
piercing cry he sprang to the dock, and grasped
close to his heart the pretty little woman who had
watched for him so patiently, and was almost left
to starve because she was “ respectable.”
Speaking of the Mahdi, Arabi Bey says :—
“ He is no prophet; there is but one Mohammad—

Young M‘Intyre (Melb.), son of leg-o 1 -

an immediate and widespread agitation among the

was done with success, and R. A. P. will, therefore,
once again be “the sweet little cherub that sits

which is shaking the world with its thunders and

an appropriate testimonal, and it is likely to ever -

The petition of ' Miss Louisa Blaxland',
recently presented to the Legislative Assembly, is
a curious and interesting document. It embodies
a chapter of history, at once personal and colonial.
The late Hon. John Blaxland m shown to have
been an immigrant of exceptional quality. He
camb out in his own ship, The Brothers, with a small
army, consisting of his family, tutor, governess,
and a body of skilled mechanics and industrials,
equipped with supplies to last several years, and
further provided with the nucleus of a flock and
a herd. Merino sheep, and Alderney cows were
among his live stock. Mr. Blaxland had a fortune
of £30,000. and set to work to utilize it in a far-
seeing and enterprizing spirit. A clearing, which
he called Canterbury, for vegetables, hops and
vines, brought as seeds or cuttings, was among his
first entorprizes. He created salt-works at “ New-
ington,” and started agriculture on land granted
to him at the Cow-pastures. He launched a
schooner for the sealing business, started a brew-
ery, a flour-mill, and a dairy, and made vigorous
although unsuccessful quest lor coal at Newing-
ton. In 1816 and 1817, when flock-masters .were
burning their wool in default of means of export,*,
Mr, Blaxland built a smalt factory and wove
blankets and tweeds for his hands. He had some-
times 300 hands, free and bond, in his employment,
and living on the fruits of the enterprizes started
with his money and energy. He encouraged
schools and founded churches. His son and his
brother rendered valuable services as explorers,
and now his daughter, Miss Louis Austra-
lia Blaxland, “in necessitous circumstances,”
appears as a suppliant to beg a grant of the old
house of her father. A grant of money was lately
made to the sister of the explorer Leichhardt,
thus establishing a precedent. That a daughter of
so valuable a colonist as the late Mr. Blaxland
merits every tenderness of consideration needs no
demonstration. Yet, there are some points which
should be cleared up before the Assembly decides
to be generous. Are there none of the family of
Blaxland who have prospered sufficiently to relieve
their relative irom the pressure of poverty and the
humiliation of public mendicancy ? If so, the duty
is theirs, not the country's. It is absurd that suc-
cessful Blaxlands should throw the burden of un-
fortunate Blaxlands upon the community. The
family should average the results of its migration.
And, again. Miss Blaxland prays to have accorded
to her, as the last surviving daughter of the late
John Blaxland, the “family home,” Newington
and its chapel, and that portion of its land pur-
chased by the late Government for £4000. Pur-
chased from whoin ? From parties who bought it
from a mortgaged, to whom it was pledged by
Mr. Blaxland, junior, for money ? Miss Blaxland,
then, it is presumed wishes that the country should
go through the form of buying the property only
to restore it to the previous owner, who had once
before had value for it. In any case, how-
ever, the prayer appears too extensive. The
use of the house for life would seem all
that can be needed to fulfil the requirements
of the nicest delicacy or most effectual
generosity towards an elderly spinster lady.
Can a man commit suicide without being
insane? Certainly. It’s true Hamlet decided that
it’s better to bear the ills that flesh is heir to than
fly to others -that we know not of. But Hamlet’s
life hadn’t at that time come to bo the unutter-
able hell of misery that ipany a poor devil experi-
ences. Hamlet’s sea of troubles would be plea-
santry compared to the life of Rufus Dawes, as
told by poor dead Marcus Clarke—and, Heaven
knows, that story was noivhit exaggerated over
what happened often in those old convict days.
No man can feel or imagine to the full another’s
troubles. There are men for ever followed by un-
merciful disaster, no matter what they do—men,
as Baudelaire says of the poet destroyed by Fate,
the curious Poe, whose foreheads bear the legend,
Never a chance— men for whom some diabolic Des-
tiny prepares misery from the cradle, over
whom the blind angel of Expiation hovers over,
and to whom the fate of actual damnation
comes at last, if it come at all. The comfortable
well-fed man of the world can afford to disbelieve
in such existences; but they are too plentiful.
When misery, the climax of tortured years, gets
so that a man can’t and won’t bear it any longer,
it’s no use telling that man of hell. It can’t be
worse to him, he thinks; and even so, he always
says to himself, as Adam Lindsay Gordon put it,
“that majy happen, but this is;” and he calctflates
that even the severest system of theology does not
insist on two hells, with no chance to escape either.
When ho has got thus far, he is fit to pull the
trigger. These observations are caused bya'young
man having shot himself. He was 37, weltapducated,
in the heyday q| manhood, and in a letter left on

Dear Sib,—
I cheerfully add my testimony to the good
effects derivcable from the use of ST. JACOBS
OIL as demonstrated in my own household. Some
few weeks ago my wife suffered severely from
pains in her head. She applied the Oil with excel-
lent results, and has since recommended it to a
friend for a case of swelling in the legs, in which
case the result was equally beneficial. It has been
used by members of my family, and its action has
satisfied my most sanguine expectations. I con-
sider it a most valuable preparation to have by
you for any household accident. I recommend it
confidently to my friends, and am thoroughly
satisfied “It Conquers Pain.”
I remain, yours truly,

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
It is stated the Hon. J. White pays Hales
a retaining fee of £100.
Lord Harris says he has no intention of
taking over a cricketing team to Canada-.
T. M‘A As ter, a well-known jockey in the
Tumut district, was recently thrown from his
horse with a fatal result.
The Victorian bred colt, Nelson, by King
Cole from My Idea, won the Derby, run at Auck-
land, N.Z., on New Year’s Day.
Old Terminus, of throat-cutting fame, is
still up to his neck in it. He won two events at
the Hay New Year s Day races.
Bourke has decided on a Sheffield handi-|
cap, to be run on or about May 25; 175 yards; first
prize £200, second £8 ', and third £40.
Englehardt, an American sporting writer,
and show manager, lias announced his intention
of shortly visiting Australasia with a number of
bicyclists and athletic novelties.
For Mr. F. Chissold’s trophy, shot at Can-,,
terbury, under the auspices of the Sydney Gun
Club, Messrs. Gannon and Davis shot their 6 birds
each, and Mr. Davis won the shoot-off.
Wrestling is now the craze amongst our
amateurs. A Redfern football Hercules, and a.
brother of Professor Miller’s—and a big brother at 1
that—both members of the Sydney Gymnasium,
are to wrestle before the 19th February, at a

Townsville (Q.) held its race meeting on

Hanlan has leased his hotel at Canada for
a number of years, and, so that no one shall assume
his title whilst he is away, he has left 2000 dollars
in the bands of the Turf, Field, and Farm, to
make a match with any sculler as soon as he re-
turns homo; or he will bet 5000 dollars that on a
fine day he will beat the record of 20min. 3seo.

For the past racing season, Aug. 1 to Jan.
8 inclusive, our crack light-weight jockey, Donald
Nicholson, heads the list with 17 wins out of 89
mounts. Hales’ record, although only scoring 15
wins, is better, as he only rode 60 times Gough
comes third with 10 wins out of a possible 56. A
losing mount means at least £3. So that it is
nearly as profitable to bo a j ockey as a night police-
man.
A series of walking matches, to come off
in Sydney, have been arranged between Willie
Franks, of Sydney, and Bernard Murphy, of Mel-
bourne, Murphy to allow Pranks 135 yards start in
one mile, 500 yards in four miles, and 875 yards in
seven miles. The one mile is to be walked on 9th
February, the four miles on the 11th February,
and the seven miles, 16th February. The match is
for £50 a side, best two out of three win the
stakes.
Charles Croucher and George J. Hanley-
had to explain to the Prahran bench (Vic.) how
they were lucky enough to win £260 from Edward
lloy, a furniture dealer, at ’’Hiding the Jack and
Queen.” Edward admitted under examination
that he himself had often cheated at cards, and
that ’twas Croucher who showed him how to
“doctor” the “pasteboard,” until at. last he
thought himself as clever as his master. He
doesn’t think so now.
The “books” caught it hot over the last
meet at Randwick, but, as Sancho Panza would
say, “he laughs best who laughs last.” A quiet
parlour in a quiet suburban hotel, a clink 5r so of
the dice, and all's well that ends well—for the
metallician. Quite a few citizens walked un-
ostentatiously opt, sadder but very much wiser
men. And now all the metallicians cave had their
boots hair-soled and heeled, and sport thunder-
and-lightning neckties.
* In England, Mr. Lefevre heads the list of
“winning owners” for 1883, as he has “annexed”
no less a sum than £20,530; then follow, in the
order named. Lord Falmouth, with £18,434; Sir P,
Johnstone, £17,551; Mr. Robert Peck, £16,595; the
Duke of Hamilton, £12,529: Mr. L. de Rothschild,
£11,782. Mr. Lefevre owes bis position tc Tristan,
who, although a five year old. has won £7600; to
Hauteur, £2990; I adislaus, £3650—both three year
olds; and to Wild Thyme, a two year old, £4375.
Edward Trickett is reported to be medi-
tating another match with Beach, and to that end
has ordered a new wager boat from Donnelly and
Sullivan. He is of opinion that, if he had used
one of their fast and light craft in the last match
with"the Dapto man, ho would have won. Ned
has oceans of pluck, but very little perspicuity.
Donnelly and Sullivan are also building a wager
boat for Pearce for his match with Clifford, and
another for Sharland, to replace the one which
went down with the TaHnan.
In England, Jem Mace has staked £50 to
hind a match for his new pretegi, Jack Davis, of
Birmingham, to contend against any man in Eng-
land or America for from thatsurn upwards, under
London Prize Ring rules or Queensberry rules. He
also offers to bet, on his own part, that, although
he is 53 years of age, no one can knock him out in
tour rounds, Queensberry rules, with soft gloves,
and states he is prepared to give Sullivan £100 for
expenses if he will accept and go over to England.
The former challenge A. Greenfield of Birming-
ham has accepted, £100 a side.
Miss Lucy Radmall, sister of the Radmall
who was Avarned off the turf some years
ago, over the Brilliancy affair, is to be married
shortly to a young baronet, She is the young lady
to whom the late Mr. “ Isonomy ” Gretton left a
trifle of some £8000 a year. Mr. Gretton actually
bequeathed her £180,000, but the executors threat-
ened to try the question, and it was ultimately
compromised by her receiving an annual income
of £6000 a year from his estate. The antecedents
TTO certainly shaky, but £6000 a year is about as,
good a recipe as tve know of for regilding a tar-’
hished reputation.
Mr. Walton, the “American Plunger,” is
reported, says the World, to have “dropped”
£30,000 during his recent visit to England. Ho
returned to New York last Saturday, with the
intention of providing the necessary funds to
liquidate his unsettled racing account over the
Liverpool and Alexandra Park meetings. Mean-
Avhile, his absence has created the utmost con-
fusion and consternation amongst both debtors
and creditors; and amongst the latter is Charles
Archer (Lord Ellesmere’s trainer), to whom Mr.
Walton laid 3400 to 300 against Boswell for the
Liverpool Cup, with the proviso of his having
“ the run of the market.”
A small attendance was the order of the
day at the Victorian Club Race meeting, although
the weather was fine, and n first-class bill of fare
placed before the public. The ball was set rolling
by the Hurdle Race, Avon by RingAvood by a
length from Sparke, Agitation third. Manfred
defeated Xantippe for the TAvo-year-old Selling
Stakes, Loporello third. Frylngpan started at 10
to 1 foj- the Victorian Club Cup, but the odds could
not stop him, and he Avon comfortably from
Chuckster; Lcsbia, three-quarters of a length
away, third. Amelia Victoria won the Selling’
Race, Hpre’s Luck second, Hannibal third. That
thorough steeplechaser. Songster, won the Steeple-
chase by a good length from Napoleon ; and
Frylngpan, with lOst. 1ft. up, finished a good day’s
sport by romping away with the Bookmakers’
Purse, Don Quixote second, and Malua third.
Bush fires and the annual races were the
most lively items of Bega news on the 10th and 11th
last. So far as the races were concerned, the sport
opened with the Maiden Plate, which resulted in a
Avin for Lady Pitsford. Five snorted silk for the
Bega Cup, appropriated by TantaAvanglo from
Mirabeau, after a good race; Reindeer, third.
Dove obtained the Welter Handicap; Lady Fleet-
wood ran away with the Firdt Foal Stakes from a
field of eleven; and Yun*tmie just managed to
land the Member’s Handicap by the shortest of
necks from Dove. The second day opened with
the Hurdle Race, won by Silly Billy, two lengths
aAvay from Kaffir; Skylark, third. Lady Fleet-
wood took the Nursery Handicap from start to
finish. Tantawanglo led Reindeer by half a length
for the Town Plate; Mirabeau, third. The Flying
Handicap fell to Merricumbene. Mirabeau finished
up the meeting by winning the Forced Handicap
,a length away from Yurammie; Reindeer, third.
* CRICKET.
The “batting ” and the “bowling” are the topics
of the day,
And “ elevens” quite the heroes of the hours;
A poet gets “the needle” as he listens to the way
Men talk about the “ players ” and their poAvers;
For a sense of fallen greatness makes his life ap-
pear a blank,
And rage illmiies his eyeballs as he gloAvera.
An opinion of my talents at the present time I
hold
Far smaller than I’ve ever held before,
(Since very few in number are the “ Avickets ” I
have boAvled,
And seldom have I made a decent “ score;”
fThough I love to run a score up at the little poet’s
' pub..
And never love to settle it—that’s more!
In speaking of the usual custom of horsey
men in treating a broken bone with an ounce of
lead, “Augur” says:—“I remember when Mari-
byrnong ran for the Derby in 1866, tie fell and
broke one of his fore legs at the fetlock joint.
When Mr. Fisher was informed of the extent of
the injury, he gave orders to have the colt shot,
and steps were taken to carryout his instructions;
but when his intending destroyer arrived at the
spot, the son of Fisherman was hobbling about on
three legs. Mr. W. Filgate, who was then in
charge of the Maribyrnong stud, determined to
save the colt’s life, with the result that he is now
about the most famous among all the sires in Aus-
tralia. Another more notable case is that of Um-
berto. This colt, when a yearling, broke one of his
hind legs, and, being a valuable animal, Mr. W. E.
Dakin determined to make an attempt to save
him. The bone quickly began to knit, and at two
years old he was able to go faster than any other
colt in the Morphetville paddocks. Now he is
training at Flemington, and nrobably Victorians:
will some day see him running into a forward
position in a big race.”
At a meeting of the National Regatta
Committee, on the 8th, it was decided that the
prize for senior fours should be £40 if crews from
other colonies competed, and £25 if otherwise;
that the 24ft. open boats compete for the Mayor’s
trophy; that the prizes for the champion race be
£30 for 1st, and £10 for 2nd, if fiv'vi compete; and
that the prizes for all comers in light skiffs be £15
for flrstand £5forsecond. Crews have been formed
at the Sydney and Mercantile clubs for the senior
fours. The four from the senior shed consists of
Moppelt, Webster, Brodie, and E. Simpson, and
the Merks. are represented by Seale, Pickering,
Brett, and Martin. There is not much to choose
between the two crews, but as a rule the Sydney
crews pull in better form than the men froin the
other side of the Quay; and if this four proves no
exception to the general rule, we feel Inclined to
pin our faith to the light blue. En passant, we
saw Pearce out on Sunday, and he did not by any
means take our fancy. He was pulling better than
he usually does with his body, but beseemed to be
feathering under water, and his left scull threw up
a miniature water-spout at the finish of every
stroke.
Says an English paper:—“In the colonies,
where there arc so many expert horsemen, feats
of daring horsemanship are by no means rare.
But it is not often in any part of the world that
such a feat as the following can be chronicled :—
‘ Mr. Trotter’s extraordinary feat of horsemanship
makes one almost a believer in the myths about
the Centaurs ; for in a run from Garradine Gorse
(in which, by the bye, I think he bad two falls) his
reins got broken, and I believe the entire head-
stall came off his hunter’s head. Nothing daunted,
he pursued perseveringly, steering his mount by
his crop (a jury-rudder, indeed), and managed to
got over this largely-fenced country for some dis-
tance in this perilous fashion.’ ” Talking of
rough riding, it would seem buckjumpers are fast
dying out in Australia, and it is not at all an un-
likely thing that in a few years a buckjumper will
be a rar|fy in the colonies. One old squatty, him-
self a noted rough rider in his dav, gave us as his
opinion that buckjumping, with very few excep-
tions, was principally ou account of the short
handling the young horses received, and the
“flash” riders, who were so common In the early
days of the colony. He assured us he had seen a
horse cut out of a mob and yarded, roped till a
man got on his back, and then turned loose out of
the yard, barebacked and unbridled, the rider
being accoutred only with a pair of spurs and a
short stick in each hand. We think this rather
puts in the shade tho English gentleman mentioned
in the first part of this par.
At the Y.R.C. meeting at Flemington, on
Ncav Year’s Day, a shocking amount of profanity
was gotthrough over the five-shilling “ luncheon ”
—far more profanity than luncheon, in fact. A
limited assortment of skinny foAvis, and the other
ghostly elements of a racecourse “luncheon,”'
were laid out on long tables underneath the
f randstand, and there it Avas, don’t you know.
t would have been a good plain feed tor fifty
people ( not of tho alderraanic persuasion), but the
management, unfortunately, had displayed too
great a liberality In the matter of seats, and, as
those seats filled up, it Avas sad to Avatch the
hungry “backers ” Avandcring about tho rooms in
search of grub which the fortunate pioneers of
the feast had already consumed. There Avere
three or four Avaiters—one to every hundred
people-lurking in dark corners, but, as they were
unable to provide fresh eatables, they feared to
venture forth into tho open and face their
voracious customers; for anything in the shape of
a really plump waiter would haA’e been cut up
into “ joints ” on the spot. Men who, until that
unhappy day, had considered themselves Chris-
tians, engaged In despicable Avrangles over the
clean-picked carcase of an antiquated duck, or
such like vanities: and the scene grew so distress-
ing that many a philosopher, pocketing his disap-
pointment and a morsel of bread, made a hurried
exodus to the nearest refreshment bar outside, to
moralise, over a pork pie, upon the splendid
financial speculation of providing a “five-shilling
luncheon.”
The meteoric burst of zeal recently dis-
played by the Melbourne police in arresting
thirteen mags, for being mags, has had cold water
thrown on it by the magistrates’ decision; the mere
fact of the “professional gambler” (that’s what the
D.T. terms them) being able to shoAr a modest
bank account, or finding a witness to come forward
and assert that the p.o. had assisted him In his
business, being held as satisfactory proof of re-
spectability. Considering that the mag Avho hasn’t
a “ little bit of brass ” by him can scarcely be re-
garded as a very dangerous member of the fra-
ternity, this decision is particularly amusing.
Police evidence is, in these cases, simply every-
thing; it is a detective's business to “know’em;”
anw, although he may have a habit of not knowing
’em when it suits his purpose, still, at the same
time, Avhen the D’s do wake up, it is a thousand
pities that they should be snubbed by an innocent
Bench. According to tho theory of the Melbourne
magistrates, any London “mobsman” Avith a de-
cept shoAV of jewellery—“good stuff ’’—about him
could folioAV his profession with impunity; but, as
a matter of fact, tho proprietors of licensed
houses in the great metropolis can always have a
man Avho “is knoAvn ” expelled from their pro-
mises if they wish it, tho “savcII’s ” patent leather
boots and glittering rings notwithstanding. The
stahvart “Robert” Avho is called in to do tho job
can usually spot his man by instinct; the pro-
duction by the mag of a neatly engraved card
with an air of injured innocence deceives him
not, but a “ co me on, and don’t let's have so much
of it,” quickly terminates the controversy.
The Melbourne Argus is getting quite
sporting in its tendencies, and recently produced
a grave leader in disparagement of “ high-class ”
colonial cricket. The Ahqus complains that the
batting of Murdoch and Horan, in the Intercolo-
nial Match, was devoid of the “dash” that we
expect from amateurs. That slogging provides
the best sport for onlookers is undeniable; but the
■ Argus goes on to say“ With us there is growing
up a race of semi-professionals, who have appa-
rently adopted, or are in process of adopting, all
, the traditions of their fully fledged brethren of
England.” Now, this is simple “ bosh.” The best
team of English professionals is vastly Inferior to
a crack amateur eleven in point of batting talent
—so much so, that the “pros.” admitted superior-
ity in the bowling department is unable to prevent
the annual matches of “Gentlemen v. Players”
from almost invariably terminating in favour of
the former. In compiling big scores, therefore,
our “sewii-professionals —as the Argus so cour-
teously terms them—are certainly not "adopting
the traditions of their fully fledged brethren ” at
home. Some of the best scores among English
professionals, of late years, were made by Henry
, Jupp. Well, in the event of a long stand being
made by Jupp and W, G. Grace (as frequently
happened in ‘‘North v. South” matches), it was
odds on the “champion” knocking up a “cen-
tury ” before the professional had completed half
that number; and yet Grace, even in his younger
days, seldom or never scored with greater rapi-
dity than has Murdoch in his recent matches.
The Irish Si-ortsman, in speaking about
the recent Malone-Aplitt race, says:— 1 “ Apllttmay
or may not be qualified for relegation to the list
of ‘has beens,’ but we Avould not say that such
qualification arose from the fact or his being
beaten by such a grand sprinter as the ex-County
Clare man, Avhose sterling performance must still
bo fresh in the minds of all Irish athletes, In 1881,
when the American flyer, L. E. Myers, competed
at the English Championship Sports, Malone ran in
the same neat as the Manhattan athlete, and, see-
ing that ho had second place safe, he did not run
himself out, but so great was the excitement at
Myers being beaten that the judge inadvertently
placed Cleaver second to Cowie. The English
press were unanimous in agreeing that the judge’s
verdict was Avrong, and In conversation some time
afterAvards with Cleaver, the latter frankly ad-
mitted to us that Molone heat him fair and square.
At this same meeting Malone was second to
another Irish athlete in P. Davin in the
long jump, clearing 33 feet 7 Inches to
winner’s 23 feet II inches. At the sports
in 1883, ill-luck again attended the Irish
sprinter, as, after Avlnning his trial heat with
W. P. Phillips (the ultimate Avinner), he was almost
left at the post In the final. Malone has run 120
yards in 13 seconds, 440 yards in 51 2-5th seconds,
cleared 5ft. 9in. In height, and put the 161b. over
37ft., so that, for all-round excellence, ho only
owned his superior in P. Davin, who has long since
acquired the right to be looked upon as tho man
of a century. For the further Information of our
Australian friends, we may state that Davin has
the record for the long jump (33ft. Sin.), and high
jump (6ft. 2Min.), while he has run 100 yards in
10 l-6th secs., 130yards hurdles,‘in 16 2-5th secs., and
and has put the 161b. weight 39ft. 6in.
After Heenan fought Tom Sayers, he was
engaged to box Avlth Young Broome, at Howe’s
circus, at tho time the circus was at Chalk Farm.
Tom Sayers, accompanied by a few friends, went
to see the Broome and Heenan set-to. Sayers,
thinking tho Benicia Boy had lost his science, was
eager to have a shy at him. Heenan was informed
that Sayers Avas anxious to fight, and he agreed to
have a bout Avith his old rival. Sayers was notified,
and lost no time in putting on tho buckskins, and
was soon facing the Benicia Boy. As soon as tho
rival champions mot each other, Sayers, no doubt,
thought of Heenan’s modus operandi at Farn-
borough, and in facing Heenan, instead of measur-
ing with his left, as pugilists generally do, he dreAV
off Avith his right, and landed a terrific hloAV on
Hoenan’s mouth, which rattled his ivories, drew
the cork, and for a second surprised him. Sayers’
friends cheered and jeered, and Heenan said ho
did not know what was in the wind; but suddenly
the thought struck him that it was a put-up iob,
and that Sayers was trying to best him. In a flash
Heenan took in the surroundings, and feinting
with his left, let go his right, which landed on
Sayers’ neck, and at the same Instant delivered a
crushing blow on Sayers’ nose, knocking him
doAvn. Sayers was up in a minute, but only to bo
knocked down again. When Sayers got up the
second time he had atapped cracked nose, and two
blackened eyes. Sayers’ friends left the circus
crestfallen, Sayers afterwards remarked that the
blows he received from Heenan in the circus Avas
like being struck Avith a locomotive. Of course,
this is the Yankee account of the affair.
The Snails’ Bay Regatta people had a gala
dgy on Saturday 1 st, when no less than 15 events
were gone through. Messrs. Elkington, Gretton,
and Robinson were starter, umpire, and judge, re-
spectively for the various roAving events; W.
Deloitte and Captain Broomfield acted as starter
and umpire in the sailing ditto; and a fresh south-
easter fluttered out the bunting gaily from tho
flagship, the Port Jackson. For the half-decked
races, tho Asteroid won the first class by any
number of minutes, and the new boat, Maritana,
won the second class; but owing to a muddle in
the Avording of the conditions of tho race, she Avas
bundled into the first class, and the lanthe was
awarded the prize; tho Rosetta waltzed away with
the 23ft. open boat prize; and the Adelphi, as
usual, splendidly handled, won the 34ft. open boat
race. Messrs. Donaldson and C. Williams won the
maiden double sculls, and we cannot lose this
opportunity of congratulating Mr. Williams
upon at last having won such a race. In
our youth we recollect Charles pulling in maiden
races, and now. In our middle age, we near of his
winning one. Persevere, my boy, and perhaps, in
our old age, we may hear of you winning a junior
contest. It seemed like “ old times, Rocks,” for
me Pandora to score a win in the 19 skiff race;
and it seemed to us as if Mr. Middleton ought to
go homo and chop his boats up for allowing
tho plucky little 9-stoncr, J. Thomson, to boat
him home for the senior skulls. The Onlda put
the other 16-footers through, and the Victor appro-
priated tho prize for tho 14-footers. Tho race of
tuo day turned up In th« senior double sculls,
which resulted in a win for the brothers Gaden,
after a desperate struggle with Messrs. Brett ana
Seale. Tho Maggie won the canvas dingy race
from a field of ten; Messrs. Langley and Nash won
the residents’ race; the Vernon boys had a race;
and the day’s sport concluded with the usual gig
and dingy flutter.
SPORTING GLEANINGS.
A week or two back, Prof. G. H. D’Har-
court, of the Sydney Gymnasium, met with an
unfortunate accident through treading partly on
the edge of a mattrass and partly off it. His foot
turned under him, and the small bone snapped at
the ancle. Mr. D’Harcourt is now able to get
about again. The foot is weak, and will have
to bo saved for some time yet The Gun-
ning cricketers travelled all the way to Yass on
New Year’s Day to get a drubbing fiom the local
team. The scores were 135 and 91 The Bega-
Cooma cricket match, played at Cooma, resulted
in a win for the local team by eight wickets.

Archer has scored a best on record in the

being 252, with 399 losses. Wood has won 186, and

WHAT CAN ONE GET THAT’S WORTH
GIVING AS A CHRISTMAS GIF V
WITHOUT EXTRAVAGANT OUTLAY?
The above is a question which a million people
will be asking themselve* this season. One wants
to .show affection and good-will by a handsome
and appropriate gift, which will be tasteful and
useful. It is the most puzzling and tiresome job
to And anything which answers these require-
ments, and is yet obtainable at a reasonable price.
The Oriental Gold Company
(Only Australian place of business, 474 tleorge-
strect, opposite the Central Entrance to the
Markets)
has solved this problem of ihe season, and pro-
vides EXQUISITE GIFTS from 5s. to £5:
Articles of dainty design and enduring beauty,
which will give delight at the first glance, and
. will last a lifetime.
ORIENTAL GOLD is the very latest discovery
of the alchemist s laboratory. There have been
good and useful imitations of sterling gold before
lU b h , avc been thrown into the shade by
this triumph of modern science. Articles of
■ mental Gold cannot, after years of wear, be dis-
tinguished from the costliest wares of the gold-
smith. So noble is this metal, that no tawdry
infGrior designs are manufac-
tureuof it. Ihe discoverers have not condescended
to apply it to base uses.
THE VERY LATEST DESIGNS IN JEWELLERY
AND BIJOUTERIE
are regularly worked up In Oriental Gold simul-
taneously with their production in sterling metal,
and, placed side by side, the one article cannot be
told from the other.
THE PRICE OF ARTICLES OP ORIENTAL
GOLD IS BUT A TRIFLE
when compared with identical models of sterling
c „ metal,
nr (roods arc mounted with the NEW
DIAMONDS, another masterpiece of the chemists
of the nineteenth century-artiliclal stones which
e i QU£ f *u he n . ot) [ e8t brilliants in fire and glitter, and
rival them in hardness.
„3L£# i8^d !. 8, *? e I a °? Paris have, with eager
appreciation, adopted Oriental Gold as worthy to
receive their happiest conceptions. The most
graceful Parisian models are impressed upon a
portion of our stock, which is replenished with
novelties by every mail.

BROTHERS, Sydney,
The wharf labourers of Sydney intend
going in for what they call a f6te champetre on
Anmversary Day. According to the terms of the
advertisement, it is to bo “the al fresco gathering
of the year,” and will take place on “the snowy
strand and amid the s\ Ivan glades of Chowder.”
Tall talk, this, for tne pliers of the hook and
truck I The affair is to be preceded by a procession
in which Neptune and his wife, Captain Cook,
Nelson and Blake, Julius C;esar, Sir Francis Drake.
Brian Boru, and about a dozen other historical
characters are to take part—or rather to be repre-
sented in appropriate costume. The programme
of sports is to be a comprehensive one, embracing
boat and foot racing, competition for Highland
flings and Irish jigs, pigs with greasy tails, and
several novelties in the shape of athletics. All
this comes of the wharf labourers having an
energetic, versatile, and fertile-minded president,
but as they are a hard-working and deserving
body of men, it is to be hoped they will pull
through all right—which there is every prospect
of their doing, as the tickets are going off like a
ship down the greasy slides at her launch.
Knowing [its absolute purity, its power-
fully invigorative and corrective action, and its
value as an anti-dyspeptic and diuretic, it is no
wonder that physicians so frequently prescribe
Wolfe’s Schnapps.

Chiakxni’S Royal Italian Circus ib.
It would seem, somehow, from the fact of
Chiarini averaging something like £600 nightly, so
far, that there are less Gradgrinds now than in the
days of Sleary; though, to our certain knowledge,
there has been but a small decrease in the quantity
of Bounderbys. Chiarini’s Circus reminded us at
once of “Hard Times.” It takes a big thing to
remind us of anything in the ordinary way, and
that is how, perhaps, our memory was pricked.
For Chiarini, this time, has done things in a
manner which would have opened the eyes of
Sleary, and would considerably exercise the mind
of another great hippie entrepreneur of the pre-
sent day—we allude to the redoubtable Ashton,
who, wo believe, is touring, with dignity' and suc-
cess, the most Northern parts of most Northern
Queensland. But they call anything a circus up
there. We remember a great event occurring in
a township of which we were at that time lay-
reader, mining-registrar, clerk of petty sessions,
and I lie police force. We had occasion, one morn-
ing, to incarcerate two strange men of foreign
mien who bad attacked our only J.P.—a Dutch
storekeeper—over a quarrel about a game of
tamberoora. The magistrate being inaccessible to
administer punishment or give evidence, incon-
sequence of being asleep with his head in the
kitchen fireplace, we were obliged to incarcerate
the individuals referred to in the slab-hut on the
flat, until such a time as his Worship should re-
vive. The constabulary, C.P.S., &c., of the town-
ship was enjoying his midday siesta after the usual
load of beet and damper, when he was wakened
by signs of a riot. Lazily requesting the
riot, through a chink in the slabs, to go home
and get sober, he once more composed himself
to slumber. The noise, however, increasing,
the constanulary turned out, and, glancing
reproachfully at the fashionable hairdresser,
who appeared to be a ringleader in the affair, said
“Whats up?” “Well, that’s a good ’un,” was
the chorus, in reply. “ Don’t you know what you
done?” cried the blacksmith. “No.” “You
don’t.?’’ yelled the saddler. “No—what?” was
our uneasy query. “ Why,” cried the indignant
riot, “ You've been and locked up the bloomin’
circus! ” So we had. For there was the rest of it
outside; a two-horse dray, a boy contortionist
with the blight, a w< cping woman who played the
organ, two monkeys, and a large white horse, that
had probably been beguiled from a cider mill.
» * *
St. Leon’s (just gone), with its pensive
camels and low comedy bear, was a capital circus:
Cole’s—the melting sweetness of whose steam-
piano is yet ringing in our ears—was a show to be
remembered with mingled feelings; Cooper and
Bailey always gave you plenty of sawdust and
"Joe Millers” for your money; but Chiarini s,
now showing in Belmore Park, can give points to
the lot, and beat them. Belmore Park is now one-
half circus; the other half is scanty turf, peopled
by recumbent boys and girls, who make derisive
remarks about the people going in, and curse
Fate, until they render night hideous, for leaving
them without the requisite “two bob”—the low-
est price charged for admission. We got into the
tent just in time to see the Mascotte entree, a pic-
turesque series of evolutions by four ladiesjand
four gentlemen, in costumes of a gorgeous cha-
racter, the whole being led by “Madame Keld
Ponente,” erstwhile Nellie Reid, who looked
splendid, and had a tremendous reception. We
should have enjoyed the act more than we did had
it not been for the “ Madame” and the “ Ponente I”
A sly way we’ve got of putting it.
♦ ♦ *
Next was—we quote the bill—“ the double
trepeze. by Messrs. French and Angelo (late of the
Folies Bergdres (sic), Paris,” High up in the air
these wonders worked, their style being superb,
their confidence unlimited. But equally wonder-
ful, in its way, was the act of Miss liosina, who
did things with cups and balls and sticks on
horseback that would puzzle half the world to do
on foot. We know, Indeed, nothing more ex-
traordinary, unless it be the way the old topers at
Punch's conjure down the Parliamentary (we
have an Inspector of Measures, now) pints
of colonial. We must tell you, too, of
the Walhalla brothers, who play two fiddles,
mixed and mingled together, and produce
music of adiverting nature; and we must certainly
not forget the astounding performance of a
“coal black Prussian stallion,” introduced by no
less a person than Guiseppe Chiarini himself. This
horse, we should say, possesses the intelligence of
at least ten country editors, and is prettier than
the prettiest picture. Then, there was Miss Ida
Stoodloy, who danced on horseback, and Perry, a
clown, who sang a very dismal comic song indeed,
and who perpetrated the following joke, known
to have first been spoken by Nero :—Clown ; “If
a pretty girl kissed you. what would you do?”
Ring-master: “Kiss her back.” clown: “I
wouldn’t.” Ring-master : "Then what would you
do, sir?” Clown: " I wouldn’t kiss her back, I’d
kiss her lips.” 345 b c.—Thunder I
• • •
All the rest was equally good, especially a
surprising bareback act over hurdles by Charles
Stoodley, and an act by Madame Zephyr, who
balances her little daughter upon a triangular
pole. Not so good, though, we consider, was the
riding of Frank Barry, who took nearly as long to
get through his four hoops as a camel would to
travel through the eye of a needle. The piece de
resistance, though, was undoubtedly the exhibition
by Mous. Abadie of the performing elephants and
and lions. It is painful to notice, though, how
terribly the lion-tamer has suffered at the hands -
or rather feet and tusks—of his pets. The tent
was packed, and as Daniel- the lions’ den recalled
to us his immortal name-used to advertise in his
bills, “Several ladies overcome by the perform-
ance, fainted during the evening,” The courtesy,
we may add, of the General Agent is to be com-
mended, It was Agrati-fying thing,

A recital by the Euphonic Society was
Pulled off on Saturday night, at the room, m Stan-
Je y‘ s treet, Woolloomooloo. The room was rather
crowded, and thee must have been at least 50
people there. Fiddles, flags, bows, drumsticks,
oassoons, flutes, tambourines, triangles, clarionets,
ana curios were scattered about. Lyres, of the
Primitive shape affected by Orpheus wheh he went
alter his old woman (the only authentic instance
a +vP ai i,' 8 to for his wife), were pasted
t-m 3 bottom of the stairs, and in spare places
round the room. Then a move was made with

een making fritters, or eating bread and I

tage than when playing a Addle. But what
most attracted our attention in this piece
was a youth heavily handicapped with short
hair and long ears. His duties appear to have
been divided between squelching mosquitoes
and working in a note now and then on the violin-
cello when nobody was minding. Whether because
of his foot slipping, or of his turning over two
leaves at once, we could not say, but, at any rate,
he got hold of a shake on the G sharp, and by the
time he’d done we were almost A natural. We
might have guessed by the wav he Axed himself
in his eh.iir, gave one sad, comprehensive smile all
round, and moistened his hand with saliva, that
there was bloody work before him, and that, having
gone so far, he was determined to see it out. Never
did we experience such a shake since the police-
man But why recall the dead past? One by
one the strings gave way until but a wreck of his
instrument remained. Still he toiled manfully on,
and worked out the remainder of the shake on the
bridge. Not till he reached over for the triangles
did wc leave our place. We once performed on
this exasperating instrument ourselves, and know
the murderous thoughts the sound of it puts in
our head; and so we left, cheerful but dreadfully
shaken.

Mr. Zulu Thompson complains that there
was nothing last week in The Bulletin about the
Egyptian War. He appeared before us, in the
street, and said this, arrayed in a costume of white
jean, sapphires, and diamonds. The sun shone
brightly—but where he stood the sun shone doubly
brightly; and, compressed into a focus by his
brilliancy, doubly dazzling was the daylight,
doubly sunny the sunshine. “How's biz.?” we
asked, approaching him (we need not say, with
trepidation). “All we ean get in,” he proudly
replied. “ What do you reckon, Mr. Thompson, is
the chief attraction of your show, which is always
attractive ? ” He paused a moment, and then,
borrowing a tent-Ay from Eastway, began to
thoughtfully polish the diamond in his shirt front.
“There are several,” he musingly said. “Now,
look at Gordon’s pictures of the Egyptian War;
can anything be Aner than these? Then, you
know, when the soft and pathetic parts come in,
how have I learned to modulate my voice until
the softest pianissimo is a fool to it. And—listen:
I have furnished eight-tenths of the Sydney villas,
and have given cruets to the residents of two-
thirds of the suburbs. My address, every night,
at 8,” he sobbingly concluded, “is the Academy
of Music,” Then ho wept himself away.

We are too good to that theatre —we mean
the Royal. We are always saying something nice
about it, if not something new, and, it is to be
hoped that we receive the thanks of the pro-
prietary. Well, there is something a little new
this week. Harwood is back again, and, fancy I
with a while moustache 1 This age is getting too
frank for us altogether. If Henry R. begins to
shame us like this, wo shall have to take ourselves
to pieces, and (hen thtro would be nothing left of
us but our courteous manner and civil bearing.
♦ * *
And, besides the novelty of Harwood
managing, there are some fresh songs and some
new locals. Those latter are, as they should be,
replete with gloom. Pantomime jokes should be
ever thus; and the Pit will take them at once. The
very mention of the name of Pastor Allen
causes a laugh at once, and that of a gentleman
from the Rocks causes the pit to rock. We
have had a little experience in this sort of work,
and what wo consider is, the less the lines scan
the better, the older and less ingenious the puns
the better; in short, the worse the boon is, the
more they feom to like it. The Royal is doing
good biz—almost phenomenal biz.; so there is a
sparkle of joy in every eye.
* * *
We don’t think there’s anything more to
say about Nellie Stewart, or Fanny Llddiard, or
Minnie Hope, this week. No. Nor about Smile-
less George, who is scintillating in Melbourne.
There is, by the way, a rumour current that the
Verdi-Musgrovc imbroglio has broken out in a
fresh place, and that new developments—as they
say in the murder cases-may be hourly expected.
We never knew a theatrical company in which
some row like this did not occur, and we never
knew one in which they did not kiss and make it
up. George could kiss Guglielmo by deputy.
Thero’d be lots of deputies.

Of course you know that “ The Silver King”
comes after the Pantomime. “The most poetic
of modern melodramas ” So be it. If even it is
as poetic as Mussy’s Pantomime, wo shall welcome
it with effusion.

Oh, and think! As Minnie Hope (now
playing the Man in the Moon in the Royal Panto.—
she’s not a bit like a man!) was wending her way
to the mansion in which she daily does religious
justice to her “ little eight,” she was accosted, at a
dark turn, by a tall man, who, seizing her by the
wrist, demanded to know what she had in her bag.
“Please, sir, only a powder-puff and a love-letter,”
said she. Disappointed of plunder, the man tore
the bag open and clutched the nowder-putf in his
hand. “ Good robber, don’t I ” sobbed Minnie.
“ Leave me the powder-puff; you may have the
love-letter.” Well, after that, learn that Payne,
the presdig—&c , is shortly to open here in con-
junction with the V.vians, and Arthur has pro-
mised to sing, during the evening, his song—
“ Run for the doctor, Charlie, dear.
Mother’s taken awfully queer.”
What! mors? Simply that Hart opened at New-
castle on Tuesday last - et puis voila.

It will make you sad to hear about the
accident that occurred to Ashton’s Circus. This
show is now travelling in Queensland. The per-
formance was in full swing the other night, when
the tent caught Are. There was awil i rush for
the door at once. In the confusion, a gentleman
left his hat behind. It was a new one, so he dashed
in again to get it. He put it on his head, and
made his way out again. Then he felt something
crawling about among his hair. He took off his
hat, and there, curled up inside and panting with
terror, was the Bengal tiger. Of course, he re-
stored it to the circus. Some other people, how-
ever, were not so honest. A man was caught
carrying the rhinoceros home under his arm. tie
had it wrapped up in a handkerchief. When they
caught him, he pretended that he had mistaken
the animal for a stray sucking-pig, and that he
was going to advertise its discovery in the paper
the next morning. But. of course, this story was
looked upon with suspicion. So, also, was the
claim of another man to the panther. He said it
was a poodle that he had lost some time before,
and that it had been painted. On examination, it
was found that this statement was incorrect. The
lion of the Libyan desert was treated with
still more indignity. Ho came to the tent the
next morning in a state of complete exhaus-
tion. It appears the boys had tied a kerosene
tin to his tail, and had been chasing him about the
town all night. When the manager saw all his
menagerie scattered in this fashion, he crossed his
ears over his face and wept. The sight of this
strong, stern man, leaning against the camel and
shedding tears, is said to have been very affecting.
One person was so much overcome that he shook
the cash-box. But it didn’t do him much good.
The treasurer kept the receipts in his mouth. The
fidelity of the camel cost the poor animal his eye-
brows, consequently h e has now to wear goggles.
Wo hear also that, on account of injuries received
by the giraffe during the Are, the tapir will now
act as advance agent. The elephant, too, was
burnt so severely that it is thought he will have
to be conveyed in a perambulator. The rest of
the animals will probably travel in a bread-waggon.
These are some of the vicissitudes which a com-
pany meets with up North. The proprietors have
our sincere sympathy. Fortunately, they are now
doing good business, and can afford to forget
their bad luck on the Queensland border.

The merry man that marshalled the Min-
strels is in trouble. He went into a drapery shop
in Carlton, and pointed to th e glorious signature, I
F. E. Hiscocks,” at the foot of a bit of paper,
and raised £8 thereon. The drapery men had been
at the Victoria Hall. They had laughed through-
out the two hours’ entertainment, and if there
was a minute in which they didn’t laugh it was
because they were asleep. Their admiration of
that bit of paper was marvellous. Mr. Leon Vita
had only cleared the threshold when they sent it
over to the Commercial Bank to ascertain whether
the banker held the same opinion of the caligraphy
that was gaining ground in their own imagina-
tions. “ Precisely so,” was the reply. It does not
appear why the drapers, who enjoyed themselves
at the hall, so suddenly committed themselves to a
microscopic examination of tne little document.
Perhaps it was the big amount that made them
don bt its genuineness. At all events, they sent the
police after Vita, and the hilarious Italian was
collared in Seymour, and conducted to the lock-
up. We pity the minstrel. If, however, he sings
in the lock-up, we pity the other people there.

The heat of the weather, which might
have been expected to diminish the attendance at
the theatres, has not had that effect at the Gaiety.
This may perhaps bo attributable to a desire to
see the Devil taking Faust down to comparatively
cool quarters in Hades. Anyhow, the attendance
at “ Faust” has been almost Faust-rate. And, while
we are on tropical subjects, wo may mention that
Mr. Gordon made a good Mophistopheles ; wo may
say, indeed, a devilish good Mephistopheles. And
Charles the Magnificent went to the Devil melodi-
ously, regretted by all who know him. And Aunis
warbled. And Verdi—and now for some butter—
verdigrease, in fact. Almost an encore for
*■ Loving Smile,” sung with the tremulo which
always disposes to shake Verdi. If we write
sharply, wo have the excuse that he sang flatly.
This is irony. Wo would have liked to have made
it flat-irony. But he was beautiful in death. If
wc could be sure of looking as lovely when we
die, we would order our little cherry-case at
once, and tell Jeames to bring round the hearse.
And the rest —hump! But, come now. It is a
source of pleasure to us to learn that “Pauland
Virginia ” 1s in active rehearsal. M. Victor Massd's
opera has been “in active rehearsal,” now, fora
month, and, therefore, we may look forward at no
distant date to something artistic from a musical
point of view.

Old “home” players will be shocked to
hear that W. H. Chippendale is hopelessly insane.
“ Chip ,” as he was affectionately styled, will be
remembered as a member of the old Haymarket
company, in the palmy days of Buckstone s
management, and when that finally broke up he
and buxom Mrs. Chip, (many years younger than
her lord) "ran” a comedy company through
the provinces. Almost Chip.’s last appearance
pehind the footlights was as Polonius, in the
Lyceum production of “Hamlet,” nine years back ;
but the veteran was then seventy-four years of
age, and beginning to show symptoms of the
infirmity which has reduced him to his present sad
condition.

Theatrical managers in England are being
terribly pestered with circulars from a lunatic
clique, yclept the “ Moral Keform Union,” beseech-
ing them to elevate the moral tone of pantomime
wheezes, and to insist upon the costume of the
premiere danseme being modest as well as pictur-
esque. The Union apparently is promoted by
some of those “nice” people who manage to dis-
cover nastiness in everything under the sun; who
display a holy acumen in detecting a double-
entendre, and hold short skirts and tights in such
abomination that they can’t keep their eyes off
the shapely limbs of the wearers. Doubtless, the
Moral Keform Union will be extending its Held of
operations very soon, and assuming the censorship
of after-dinner speeches, parliamentary debates,
and fireside conversations. A Sydney branch office
is already in contemplation.
THE MORAL REFORM UNION.
Just accept the timely warning,
That an era new is dawning.
When you’ll really need to mind your P’s and
Q’s;
You must sober be and prayerful,
And oh I very, very careful,
If you’ve any sort of character to lose.
Are you wont to be light hearted ?
There’s a “ Union ” lately started
ftTo discover any “ coarseness ” in your fun,
And detect—so says the rumour—
Double meanings in your humour,
And something most improper in a pun.
Let your conduct bo most guarded,
If you wish to be regarded
With the favour of the holy M.R.A. ;
Should you laugh, and talk unduly,
Why, report your conduct truly
To the guardians of your morals, every day.
And, moreover, for the future.
When you find a girl to suit yer,
And no longer have the wish to live alone,
Ere you dwell in sweet communion
With a wife, consult the “ Union”—
P'raps it’s wrong to form a union of your own I

There was once a man called Albertus
Srin »t&WS&S
?tlll people who bXvein him. As why shou dn’t
there be ? Thereare people who believe in Milner
Stephen Well, some of these disciples of Albertus
were lately found in a Swiss gi’aveyard. at mld-
night pulling up tombstones, and burying five-
frano*pieces under them. It seems that Albert us
states!in one of Uls books, that by doing this, and
living in a hut, naked, on bread and water,
and repeating certain magic phrases, the total
sum buried (100 francs) would be increased to
5 000 000 francs. There were three of them
engaged in this profitable employment. Two
of them were discovered in a hut by the police.
The other had loft. On examination, it was found
teat the buried money had left with him. This is
almost ns good reading as the chronicle of a church
fund. Albertus Magnus was an extremely en-
lightened man to have lived in the dark ages. He
had evidently a cemetery of his own, and played
the same pleasant game as tho Swiss absconder. If
he had lived in these days, we have no hesitation ]
in saving that he would have been well-connected.
For all that, however, we think the men who
acted on his recipe had some justification for
teeir conduct. We know some graves in our own
cemeteries where one might bury money with
“most dead certainty of Its Increasing The.men
who are buried there would add to It even in
death.

A few definitions of “mother-in-law”:—

We print it out of respect to the sender (a
man of high position and unblemished character),
but we have our opinion. Thirty people, half of
them ladies, started for a four days’trip to the
Hawkesbury, and no looking-glass was brought!
The bottoms of some billy-cans in the ladies' cabin
were found to have been highly polished before
the trip was over; but whether this was to supply
a rude substitute, or was merely an example of
Industry—well, we can only surmise.

It reads like a novel. Some few years age
Mademoiselle Sembrieh was teaching music as t
girl in Austria, with such indifferent succ.-ss as to
barely keep within the pale of genteel poverty
She attracted the notice of Prof. William Stenzcl,
who, after giving her some lessons, sent her at his
own expense to the best academies of Europe, to
study singing under Lamperte and piano under
Liszt. Sembrlch has made a great name, been the
pet of London, and Is now a dangerous rival in
New York to Patti and Nillson. And in the height
of her fame comes the announcement that Prof.
Stenzel is to lead to the altar the great singer,
whom he befriended as a girl in Austria when a

This paragraph is intended particularly
for ladles with husbands who spend their money
In playing Nap. and chicken-hazard. There is a
lady In Young who wants te start a movement
among her sex to put down gambling. H ut she is
doubtful about how to begin. To her and to
others similarly situated, we beg to offer our sin-
cere sympathy and a suggestion. This is the
suggestion: Your husband spends his money on
cards. You wish to stop him. There is nothing
easier. Empty his pockets every night, and refuse
to return him the money. After you have done
this once or twice, he will probably kill you and
be hanged afterwards. You won’t be worried any
more with his gambling. This plan has never been
known to fall.
General De Ainslie, in tbs just published
“Life, as I have found it.” tells the following
story of an elopement“This marriage between
the Earl of Westmoreland and Miss Child, in 1783,
had been a runaway one; and I remember a story
of my grand-uncle, * Charles,’ Lord Grey, who was
a friend of the earls, having in some degree
assisted the flying pair, Inasmuch that, being at
the time a captain in the King’s Dragoon Guards,
and quartered somewhere on their line of flight,
he happened to be exercising his troops in march-
ing order when their carriage came thundering
along the road; and Lord Westmoreland, putting
his head out of window, begged my uncle to
throw all the impediment in his power in the way
of Mr. Child, who was close behind, which Lord
Grey contrived to do by arranging his dragoons in
I such a manner that it required some time to pass
them.”
Here is a sketch; The nearest approach to
a girl in trousers now walks London streets. She
ventures as near trousers as she dares, wears cut-
away coat, upright collar and a cane. She
buys all the checks and tweeds to be had,
an> thing with a suspicion of red trailing
through it, and wears her hands in her
pockets. Her skirts are scrupulously devoid
of panel draperies. She is as straight up and down
as Nelson's column, and walks with long strides
and a well-defined intention to get somewhere.
She runs to solid white shirt fronts and studs,
and has a horsey necktie. She dotes on a little
ticket pocket in her sweet coat, and carries a
daggling eyeglass. She wears a man's small hat,
and grasps when without a cane, a neatly reefed
umbrella. The men in her set who expect to see
her In top boots are surprised to find her the most
shrinking', lady-like girl at the ball. Ina charming
white toilet, singularly devoid of rattling, clatter-
ing things, she goes her way, dances without
abandon, and converses on the current topics of
the day.
Twopeny is a rare old boy. When he
was staging around about his marvellous exhibi-
tion, no one suspected he was looking under colo-
nial sofas and spotting the size of the feet of our
girls. But that’s what he was mainly up to, or
down to. In the droll hash he calls a book, he
throws our girls about scandalously. The com-
monest type of girl in Australia, he says, has
largo f°et.” Now, we bad never noticed that
fault much. We only remember a few cases in
which the size of feet became a matter for reflec-
tion. One case was when we saw the door of a
’bus wide open. She wasinside by herself, but the
lioorspace was rather scant. Another time wo had
observed, after a shower of rain, that about 15
yards of the Hags in George-streetwere quite dry,
and had begun to talk of the patchy way the ram
had fallen; but wo were told that she had been
standing there during the shower. Twopeny,
however, goes on to say that ‘ her faults spring
not from her heart but fr*ra her head. That s
nonsense. They spring from neither. If irom
anywhere, it’s from her ankles they spring.
Betsy Wardle’s excuse, when charged at
the Liverpool (Eng.) assizes with having biga-
mously married George Chisoal, was that her Ijjw-

Roseby. To th» last witness Mr. Justice Denman
remarked I am not sure that you are not guilty
of bigamy, or of being an accessory before the
fact You must not do this sort of thing again.
People have no right to sell their wives for a quart
of beer or anything else. George Chisnal, the
second husband, just out of his teens, was the
next witness. His Lordship: How did you come

Ladies, read this. It’s all about kissing :
May never lady press his lips,
His proffered love returning.
Who makes a furnace of his mouth.
And keeps his chimney burning.
May each true woman shun his sight,
For fear his fumes would choke her,
And none but those who smoke themselves
Have kisses for a smoker.
If kissing were not lawful, the lawyers would not
use it, . ,. ,
And if it were not pious, the clergy would not
choose it; ,, , ,,
And if it were not a dainty thing the ladies would
not crave it,
And it it were not plentiful, the poor girls could
not have it,
When we dwell on the lips of the lass we adore,
Not a pleasure in nature is missing;
May his soul be in Heaven I he deserves it I’m sure,
Who was the inventor of kissing.
Master Adam I verily think was the man,
Whose discovery will ne’er be surpassed;
And since the sweet game with creation began,
To the end of the world may it last.
OSCULATION".
Willie, what is osculation ?
Osculation, Bella, dear,
Is a learn’d expression, queer,
For a nice sensation:
I put my arm thus, round your waist,
Your head sinks on its resting place;
This is “ approximation ”;
You need not fear—
There’s no one near;
I then—
Oh, dear!
Bella, that's osculation.
For some time past, since photography
has reached its present splendid perfection, oneyf
1 the freaks of wild, well-born American beauties
hLS been to go in little secret parties and get
photographed—in considerably less raiment than
is generally deemed necessary by society. Each
beauty would choose that particular line of dis-
play best suiting her own physique. The whole
thing was kept most saci edly secret; indeed, what
the girls could do with the pictures is a puzzle, as
it is obvious they could not have any extensive
circulation. About three months ago, this pecu-
liar development of vanity caused a good deal of
trouble, and lost an Ohio Venus a virtuous hus-
band. The lady was a bel'e of good family, who
used to watch the changes and charms of her com-
plexion and contour closer than a miser does his
treasure, and some time previously she had been
beautifully photographed in the style indicated
and appeared in the picture with that portion of
her figure “which the poets rave entirely
uuapparelled. Subsequently she had some photos.
taken In ordinary dress, for album purposes—les4
attractive, but more adapted for general circu-
lation. It was known she was engaged; and one
day she asked her fiance to call at the photograph;
er's, and get a dozen cartes she bad ordered troni
an old negative. He naturally took the liberty of
looking at the packet before leaving the studio.
As he opened it, the cards dropped like hot coaid
tro'm his hand. He looked at the confused photo-
grapher, again at the cards on the floor, and then,
turning a fiery red, gathered them up, and hastily
left the place. By some mistake, the photographer
had given him the wrong pictures; that is, those
taken not for publication—though they certainly
might have been offered as satisfactory evidence
of good faith to an intending husband, if it were
usual to look for any such guarantees. The lady
got her photos, but by mail; and the young man
Intimated that he had no intention of calling on
her again. But he couldn’t have been an ordinary
young man.
A decidedly peculiar phase of conjugal
relationship is shown by the suit of Mrs. Heorgina
Weldon against her husband, just tried before Sir
James Hannon. H seems that Mr. Weldon, bein>r
no doubt a quiet-loving man, objects to live with
Georgina; and on her bringing a suit for “ restitu-
tion of conjugal rights,” offered to provide her
with a fine house in any neighbourhood she liked,
and £500 a year. This plain offer, and it just shows
how you can’t please some women, she stoutly
refused to be satisfied with. She wanted more
conjugal rights. Mrs. Weldon (who is the lady that,
some years ago, Gounod, the composer, was so
infatuated with as a singer) appeared in person to
argue her rights, and quite upheld the c redit of
her sex for eloquence. This is how her suit
trundled along part of the time:—Sir James Han-
nen: “I take it Mr. Weldon considers himself not
bound to live in the same house?” Counsel: “That
is so, my lord.” Mrs. Weldon, very sharply; “ I do
not wish the house taken for me as its mistress.’'
Sir James: “I do not think you can assist me,
madam. It is a legal question. There is a house you
can go to, with two servants, while you will still
have your allowance; so you are not in a position
of hardship.” Mrs. Weldon: “I should be insane
to accept such an offer. There is moral hardship.
What is the use of the marriage service if your
husband does not live with you ? ” (Laughter.)
Sir James Hannen: “I shall consider my judg-
ment.” Mrs, Weldon, sarcastic: “More ‘reason-
able time,’ my lord. (Laughter.) This sort of
thing has becu going on for 3U years. I shall not
go into the house to live.” air James Hannen:
That is vour affair, not mine.” Mrs. Weldon
favoured tils lordship with her opinion that a hus-
band ought to live with his wife, and not “be
encouraged to live away.” Sir James thought the
house, servants, and allowance ought to be enough
to satisfy her. Mrs. Weldon made the pithy re-
mark: “ I say it is notl ” It i« difficult to guess
what Georgina really wants more. As there is
evidently a coolness between her and her hubby,
and they are probably “not speaking,” we’re
afraid, even if he did live in the house, she would
still be dissatisfled. Though there is always the
conjugal right of the fl it-iron and rolling-pin.
• • *
Now that strenuous efforts are being
made to wipe out of the marriage service the
absurd word “ obey,” it will not be considered out
of place to quote old Sir John Bowring, who once
observed, “With this ring I thee wed, is sorcery;
with my body I thee worship, is Idolatry ; and
with my worldly goods I thee endow, is a flat
falsehood.”
Swiss Commissioner’s Speech.
Extract from a speech delivered at the Amphi-
theatre of the Primary College of La Chaux-de-
Fonds, Tuesday, the 14th day of November, 1876,
by M. Edouard Favre-Perrel. Swiss Commissioner
and juror to the Philadelphia Exhibition:—
On the Waltham “ Riverside ” Watch.
. . . “The Waltham Company make the
entire watch—from the tlrst screw to the case and
dial. It would even be difficult for them to use
our products, so great is the regularity, so minute
the precision, with which their machines work-
They arrive at the regulation of the watch—so to
say —without having seen it. When the watch is
given to the adjuster, the foreman delivers to him
the corresponding hair-spring and the watch is
regulated. (Sensation among the audience.) Here
is what I have seen, gentlemen I I asked from the
director of the Waltham Company, a watch of tho
fifth grade. A large safe was opened before me;
at random I took a watch out of it and fastened it
to my chain. Tho director, having asked me to
let him have the watch for two or three days, so
as to observe the motion. 1 answered, ‘ On the con-
trary, i persist in weariEg it just as it is. to obtain
an exact idea of your manufacture.’ At Paris, 1 set
my watch by a regulator on the Boulevard, and on
the sixth day 1 observed that it had varied 33
s conds. And this watch is of the fifth American
grade; it cost 75 francs (movement without case).
At my arrival at Lode, 1 showed the watch to one
of our first adjusters, who asked permission to
•take it down’—in other words, to take it to
pieces. 1, however, wished fit st to observe it; and
here is the result, which I noted: Hanging, daily
variation, seconds; variation in different posi-
tions, from 4 to 8 seconds; in the ‘heated room,
the variation was but very slight. Having thus ob-
served it, I handed tho watch to the adjuster, who
took it down. After the lapse of a tew days, he
came to me and said, word lor word: ‘lam com-
pletely overwhelmed: the result is incredible; one
would not find one such watch among 50,000of our
manufacture.’
“ This watch, gentlemen, 1 repeat to you, I took
at hazard—out of a heap, as we say. You under-
stand, from this example, that the Waltham watch
maybe preferred to tho Swiss. I have finished,
fentlcmcn, and I have told you of things such as
have seen them. It remains for us to profit
from this sad experience, and to improve our
manufacture. Competent men are not wanting
among us; they must go to work at once.”

From the Overland China Mail we cull
the following Chinese note " There are not
many really noble acts which can be recorded of
Chinese Emperors ; but the Han Emperor la an
exception. When raised to the throne by the
Chinese Warwick, he was invited to select an
Empress, and at once said, * Bring me the old
sword I wore in my humbler days.’ The old
‘Sword’ was a daughter of a eunuch who had
nourished the youth during his obscurity.” The
note would have been more interesting bad it ex-
plained where the eunuch picked up the daughter.

The Parramatta Independent tells the

This is what a church elder from
the land of Dubbo says:—“I lack words to
express my indignation at such an immoral en-

that, that pious elder had ten tickets in a horse

The D.T. thinks that a lucrative trade in
frozen meat might be driven between Australia

natives of Java and Sumatra don’t eat meat, and
they have no money. These objections may ap-

state them in order that they may be removed

out thuswiso
“ She touches ray cheek, and I quiver,
I tremble with exquisite pains ;
She sighs—like an over-charged river.
My blood rushes on through my veins.
She smiles—and in mad tiger fashion,
As the tiger fondles her own,
I clasp her with fierceness and passion,
And kiss her with shudder and groan.”

Excursionists to Melbourne from Geelong
and Ballarat are very indignant with the Railway
Department for the treatment they received
during the recent holidays. The Geelong people
were made travel in cattle-trucks, and they com-
plain bitterly of the Minister’s insult; and the
Ballarat people were made travel in pig-trucks,
and they also objurgate the Minister. For peace
sake we should therefore recommend the Minis-
ter to work out, in the course of the year, a plan
whereby these arrangements may be altered. If
no better scheme can be devised, we would suggest
that, next time, the cattle-trucks be sent to
Ballarat, and the pig-trucks to Geelong. That
would be, at all events, a change, an 4 would prove
that there was some vitality at the head of affairs.
A country paper revives the following
story about mosquitoes:—" They are very bad on
the Booligal plains. Two men got into a 400-gal-
lon tank to escape them. The ’squltoes set to
work and bored through. The astonished inmates
thinking to beat their torn enters, rivetted the
borers inside. Then the large insects fluttered
their wings, and, raising tank, men, and all, flew
away, and nothing more was ever seen of them! ”
Of course, we know this kind of mosquitoes well.
They have eyes like tram-lights, and breathe
smoke and fire. Two of them came into our office
with.a reporter one day. At least he said they did.
Anyhow, we had to tell him we bad caught them
and chained them in the cellar, before he would
stir out again. But tho writer o£ that story about
the tank will meet those mosquitoes again, right
enough. And they will wear horns next time ho
sees them.
We observe, with some confusion, that
three gentlemen have been remanded, or com-
mitted, or something, for ill using a Chinaman. It
seems that five of these free and independent citi-
zens (two of whom were not, at the first enquiry,
arrested) kicked and “bashed” (their own ver-
nacular) tho Celestial, and wore, doubtless, very
much surprised at being apprehended. Head this
little bit of the delicate report:—“The witness
identified Wong Ken as the Chinaman whom ho
saw being ill-treated. Five men were kicking the
Chinaman, and dragging him by the hair of bis
head. Did not see the commencement of the
assault. Tho prisoner Wagner kicked the China-
man three or four limes in the ribs. Wagner said.
‘ Kick the ’ ’’ &c. Now. we want 1o know what
this means! It appean you can’t, in tho age in
which we live, even kill a Chinaman you don’t
like, and owe for him. Thus thesotl roe lino young
fellows are temporarily incarcerated in durance
vile, and the corners of the city streets are at
present deprived of the adornment of their pre-
sence. We have killed so many Chinamen in our
time, and violently assaulted so many others nnti
they secretly buried them, that these young gentle-
men have, in their affliction, our sincere sympathy.
We have, indeed, killed,so many people in our day,
with ven-e and other weapons, at a time, too. when

Kanaka or a Celestial discovered, that we are
beginning to think the Caucasian, so tar as we are
concerned, is getting played out. Messrs. James
O’Brien, James Magner, and George Mulholland
are now deprived of their civil rights, and, what
affects them, perhaps, to a greater extent, their
tobacco, the skin of thtir backs. They
have, it seems, offended against the law ; but
t icy knew no bettor. In this s”nny country
we have been educated to killing China-
men; and lots of people—including ourselves—
have always thought slaying a Ceh-stial a pecu-
liarly Christian thing to do. It appears now we
were all mistaken. Things have com« to a
pretty pass, indeed, when but there, we
are confident, in this instance, that civili-
zation will assert itself, and that an edu-
cated and enlightened community will, at
no distant date, once more he allowed to “ bash ”
and kick and stone an inoffensive Chinaman until
he is on the verge of the grave. Is this a free
country—we ferociously ask—or is it not ? If it be
one, let us have our rights. If, stay—but no trea-
son. Let, however, an arbitrary Government

Melbourne police inspectors are too busily
engaged in effecting “splendid captures” to bo
able to devote their official minds to such trifles as
popular literature. During the hearing of the
unsavoury Nathan case, it came out in evidence
that one of Mr. N.’s soiled doves was familiarly
known as “Sarah Gamp.” This elicited from an
artful sub-inspector the information that “ho
didn’t believe her name was Gamp at all.” And
when the irreverent audience tittered, the digni-
fied functionary glared around the court, and
wondered, no doubt, what the Dickens they were
laughing at.
It is pleasant, indeed, to learn that the

quite so far over here. An old lady was charged
at the South Melbourne Court with making use of
words foreign to our dictionaries; and the Bench,
while inflicting a penalty of forty shillings on the

“stamp out offences of this kind.” When the

we sincerely trust they will devote themselves to

alderman, and “ put down suicide.”
Major Sargood, tho Victorian Mars, is
greatly idolised. It was thought he was going to

militia bounded against their waistcoats t’ll tho
stitches sprang. It would have been a pity if
Major Sargood had died, for he is a fine-looking
man, and has a clear conception of what a colonial
“ sojer ” should be. The Major holds that the
colonial soldier should be “ a gentleman.” This is
a grand view of the subject. He also thinks that
in our time there will be no need to use powder,
unless in the harmless way of practice. This gives
splendid support to the grand view. If the Major
had died, we should have lost our grip of these
two great truths. What harm if wo had ? Well,
then we should have had no militia. Men were
not going to list with a chance of getting killed.
What harm if we had no militia 't Well, then fine-
looking men would not have been able to posture
in picturesque military uniforms, and our nurse-
girls would not be so anxious to take our children
out for an airing in the afternoon. Lots of evils
would have happened, and we therefore join the
crowd and thank tho Major for not dying.
Tho llev. J. S. White, M.A., LL.D., of
Singleton, considers that no race has a right to
annex teiritory and war with savages unless it is a
fruitful and multiplying race. It was on the con-
dition of fruitfulness and multiplication that the
original fee-simple was given by tho Creator to
man, and, when tho latter fails in his portion of
tho contract, his title becomes Invalid an 1 his
claim liable to be jumped. Starting from these
premises, tho Rev. White argues that France,
hiving lost her fruitfulness, is “guilty of tres-
pass, incurs guilt, and ensures punishment ” by
trying to dispossess savage tribes. But the Anglo-
Saxon, having mastered the “multiplication”
table, and determined to go through with it, has
tho best title to occupy the earth in accordance
with tho otiginal grant. But if “fruitfulness” is
tho sole essential, surely a good word might be
put in for the Chinese, Hindoos, and others wo
know of? Put it on the •’fruitfulness” ground,
in fact, and the South Sea Islanders would have
Divine warrant for annexing any civilised coun-
try. They are so fruitful that, tor centuries be-
fore missionaries stepped their procreative games,
their islands wore too small for them, and they

nel Ike Austin pale into insignificance beside tl e
recent exploit of a Ballarat marksman. This
gentleman was practising at one of the targets < f
rue Rifie Club, from the 500 yards range, when, I y
somo means, the bullet contrived not only to nuts
he target, but to dodge ihe hill behind it, whi< h
is some eightj feet high. After pursuing its mac
career for a full half mile, the refractory mot set
of load arrived at tho local police station, ltdidn’t
kill a “ botiby,” though, unfortunately: butt nu-
tented itself with striking the kitchen wall, and
crashing it to the ground. This last item, by the
way, suggests the feasibility of an able-bodied
prisoner being capable of utterly destroying that
police station by blowing on it. However, r> tv-
nnns a nos moutons (as the Chinese say), this affair
has, we understand, caused a feeling of grave dis-
quiet among those living in proximity to the
butts; and we can accept that statement with a
simple, childlike faith. We wouldn’t like to reside
within rifle range of Ballarat until that eccentiic
snootist is dead and buried; but we are despatch-
ing our mother-in-law on a trip lo that locality,
nod have just ordered a suit of shiny black in anti-
cipation of her premature decease.

Land Sale at Manly Reach.
As regards suburban property, there is no head-
line likely to prove more attractive than the one
which caps this article. Any stranger who knows
Manly Beach, and knows what are even the near
requirements of our great metropolis, could
Hardly understand a big land sale at Manly at this
time ot day. Probably, in any other community
in the world, every available inch of land at such
a matchless-looking place as Manly would hat e
been snapped up years ago, being now unobtain-
able except at fabulous figures. The ordinary
city visitor to this delightful spot wonders at the
numerous unoccupied building sites there ; and
the prediction ot ninety-nine out ot a hundred is,
that there will shortly be a run on building opera-
tions, which will completely shut out hesitating
investors. An announcement that has taken a
goof many by surprise is that of the sale, on
Thursday, January 31st, of nearly 300 villa sites
oa Careen Estate, tuo Heights of Manly; there
was no previous announcement of this important
sale, and Mr. Pritchard, the auctioneer, begins
the year with a very important undertaking. The
proprietors, in selling the land, do not damage
surroundihg properties by a niggardly sub-divi-
si m, as there are no blocks less than 50ft. wide,
and there is neither a street nor road of Jess widt h
man a full chain. The title is a grant from the
Crown, and the property enjoys a never-failing
supply of fresh water; while for garden purposes
the soil cannot bo surpassed. The proprietors
mean to sell almost without reserve; as they fix
toe upset price at the nominal sum of Jb'O for
each block, and will accept ill per block deposit,
the balance to bo paid by easy inatalrno.-ts, bearing
Interest at the rate of 0 per cent, per annum. A
man ihus may buy to build upon, or hold for an
advance which is certain. This is a sale at which
country residents and investors should he present,
or b'.' represented in some way. It isa rare chance
for good investment in suburban property; while
for men ot means it gives an opportunity for the
erection of a seaside residci.ee in one of the most
delightful spots on the Australian continent.
Wo know Hie whole of thorn—Jem Mace,
Harry Sellers, Christie, Jack Thompson, Miller,
Larry Foley, and a lot more. They are plucky in
their way, but we still stick to our opinion that
the pluckiest man in Australia at the present
moment-always barring Hugh MVoll, the mem-
ber for Mandurang (Vic.)—is Mr. John Itae, of
Ironbark, Sandhurst. He not only writes poetry,
but prints it, and puts his name to it. Now, we
write poetry ourselves. It is no disgrace to a man
when his great deep is bubbling over with indig-
nation at the tlie neglect of a cold world, or the
inability to obtain credit for a pot of porter, to
fly to song for solace—to seize on rhythm as a vent
for feelings that must have way. As we said,
we do it ourselves, but then we run our complain-
ings Into some far-off country journal—'»nd sign
them with the names ot our bitterest enemies, it
is otherwise with Mr. llae. He signs his burning
thoughts, and prints them in the Advertiser and
the Independent, two respectable Iteudigo jour-
nals. No popular demonstration has yet been
made against either paper, and it is said that Mr.
Kae himself often walksdown theMall unattended,
except by a blood-hound. His latest eoi- undrtxn
la published in the Independent, and ontmed
“ Beat the charging drum.”
It is in the form of an allegory, and is worked out
with considerable skill, and a nice attention io
details. There has been a fight, and
“ A captain who the van bad led
Without a sign of fear,
Was deeply wounded on the head.
And carried to the rear.”
Wo would suggest, with diffidence, that if Mr. Kao
had described the missile that was the proximate
cause ot the Captain's removal, he would have
supplied authentic information on what must now
remain a matter of mere surmise. We have seen
some ugly wounds i esulting from a clothes-prop,
and even a brick in the hands of a determined man
has desired the gangway before now. To us, i hen,
it would seem that, without altering sun e or
metre, the above might have been given: -
“ A captain who bad led the van.
While stooping down to pick
His way across a fallen man,
Was fettled with a brick.”
This, it appears to us, satisfies the natural curio-
sity of readers to kno\v why C'o Captain deter-
mined to remain where he was, and advised his
followers to “foot it.” Well, he was brought to
the rear, and the surgeon, seeing that his head
looked as if “Jumbo” had sat on it in mistake,
knew there was something wrong. The officer
died, and wo am asked whether we are prepared to
meet death with the same resignation and hope
as he.—
“ I fight a battle every day.
And bullets Ily around :
If one perchance should come my way,
And lay me on the ground.”
We are cramped for space this week, and so can
give no more extracts. We may return to the
subject again; but we have said enough, we fust,
to show that a poet of no mean order is amongst
us, and it will beourown fault if he is not progeny
appreciated.
The Queanbeyan Gale publishes thirty
reasons ior the abolishment ot alcoholic drinks,
giving as the “98th ” of these reasons that “ it is
contrary to the Bible.” Now, as a matter of fact,
though the Bible in many places protests against
intemperance, it advocates the use of alcoholic
drinks. The “drink ye all of this,” was a distinct
command to take a glass of alcoholic liquor, all
the ravings of the teetotallers anent unfermented
wine notwithstanding.
The Melbourne D.T. was more like a comic
paper than usual in its report of a picnic given to
the inmates of the Kew Asylum. After making a
s were reflection on the brain power of the busi-
ness men of the colony by observing that “it is
pleasant to note that, at this particular season of
the year, when so many enjoy relaxation from the
tofl* of business life, those bereft of reason have
not been forgotten.” it goes on to tell us of the
pastimes indulged in by our unfortunate fellow
countrymen on this interesting occasion. “Some
of thorn jumped and romped like schoolboys, whilst
others (including the D.T. reporter; became inter-
ested spectators of what was going on. Haces were
conducted in the most serious manner, and the
activity displayed by some of the competitors was
wonderful.” That a lunatic should be active is,
Indeed, remarkable—almost as remarkable as the
intelligence that “the competition for the prizes
offered, consisting of pipes and cakes of tobacco ,
was keen, and certainly more honest than foo<-
races usually are.” Without commenting on the
grammatical construction of that last sentence,
wo will merely express our astonishment at any
lunaiic “ running straight” for a cako of tobacco.
But when “ our reporter” goes so far as to say
that “an abundant supply of eatables was done
full justice to.’’ we feel bound to state our decided
opinion that he is drawing on his imagination, it
is impossible to do ” full justice ” to a charity pic-
nic sandwich: it defies the best endeavours.

H.tt. Highness, to enhance tho value of the gilt,
pointed out to the recipient (who was represented

who trusted that wars might be infrequent. We
thoroughly believe him.
Our views on the triangles and the eat-o’-
nlno tails have been too often expressed to call for
recapitulation. But one thing staggers us. We’ve
endeavoured to cipher it out, but it is as hard as
a cubic equation. At Denillquin, a prisoner is sen-
tenced to 10 lashes, shrieks frightfully at tho first
and second, and faints after the third. Wherever
the punishment is applied in N.8. Wales, an accom-
paniment of j ells attends it. Yet the sufferers are
nearly all of Britlsn descent—some British born.
Now, we have seen hundreds of British sailors and
soldiers flogged, and—with one exception—never
heard a gioan. And this at a time, mind you,
when 150 stripes were the least number awarded 1
Indeed, when an exceptionally insubordinate cha-
racter had to be punished, the horrible custom was
sometimes indulged in of steeping the “eat’’ in
brine, and theft insinuating small shot Into each of
the8I knots. The result was notan “excoriation,”
as in the Denlliquin case, but the removal of a
mass of blood and tissue at every stroke. This
was tho sort of punishment men had to put up
with not so many years ago. When cut down, they
appeared as if they’d jusi been taken off a dissect-
ing table. Talk of your floggings tn N.8. Wales I

The Australian Vinegar Works.
v e have, in the case of the Australian Vinegar
Works, another instance of the steady develop-
ment, of the industries established in this country,
indicating- once more thatitis notartifleial support
that is needed to this end, but enterprise and good
judgment. It is only a few years ago, compara-
tively speaking, that the Australian Vinegar Works
were started, and the proprietor had every kind of
difficulty almost to contend against in the way of
unskilled labour and the deep seated prejudice in
favour of the Imported article. Mr. D. J. Monk,
the founder of the business, was, however,
resolutely resolved to succeed, and he has suc-
ceeded boi ond expectations. Five years ago the
rudest appliances and the smallest premises were
ample fo ■ a 1 demands. Now the premises are
found enlarged to the extent of a first-class brew-
ers. with appliances of no less value and capa-
bility, an I the output meets nearly two thirds of
the whole requirements of the trade of N.S W.
The Ausra iun Vinegar Works are situated in
Sussex-strcef, with spacious inway from that
thoroughfare, and ample roadway into Bathurst-
street via Barker Lane. The old edifice, which
served lor years for the purpose of a manufactory,
has been pulled down and in its stead is found
a remarkably rtaunch square two-storey brick
building, specially designed for the requirements
of the business. This structure is nearly 80 feet
square, with foundations and substructure of
sufficient strength to allow of two additional
storeys when required. It is divided into several
departments for boiling, clarifying, bottling, cask-
in g, despatching, &c., with divisions for the steam
and mechanical arrangements. There is hardly a
brewery in the colony with so many or so capa-
cious vats as are here found in constant use.
The process of manufacture is of the simplest
scientific character, securing the best vinegar
t hat can possibly bo made. On an upper floor
are two 5000-gallon generators; and from these
the liquor passes, by means of pipes, to ten gigan-
tic vats, capable of holdi g near upon 80,000 gal-
lons of vinegar. From these vats the vinegar
comes clarified in the most effective mann< r; and
in order fo save time and labour, the liquid, as it
flows from them, is forced, by three neat and
powerful steam pumps, to several smaller vats in
other parts of the premises, where the bottling
and corking is going along with great activity.
In point of fact, the vinegar, except when being
tested, is never seen from the first process till it Is
obterved, in brilliant colours, in the various
bottles. In the bottling and capsuling departments
there are all the latest appliances, notably an
hydraulic appliance for fixing the capsule. The
Works form a great series of industilal catacombf,
there being case-making, cooperage, bottle wash-
ing, labelling, packing, and despatching branches,
each employing several hands; and beneath the
works, in every conceivable place, are stored
hundreds of thousands of bottle'’, ready for
immediate use. A few years ago, the output
of the works was good at 100 gallons of vinegar
per week—now the output varies between 2000
and 3000 gallons in bottles, and 500 hhds. for
the wholesale hulk houses. 'the foreign
and English manufactured articles are daily being
beaten out of the market; in fact, the Australian
Vinegar Works hold the entire trade. Steady em-
ployment is given, one way or another, to not
many less than fifty hands. Prize medals hav<
been won bv the Australian Vinegar Works for
exhibits at the .London International Exhibition,
and also at the Sydney and Melbourne Exhibi-
tions, and the recent World Exposition at Amster-
dam. Mr. D. J. nk, the i roprietor, who has
stuck to his undert iking witn the per-
MStency, well deserves the support his enterprise
has won; and that further developments are pro-
jected, is proof that this support from the public
hasn’t been th own away.

It was great fun the other day at Brisbane,
at the sports, when, at the finish of the bicycle
races, Stombuco, in his excitement, did an extra
round. The public, noting the mistake, though'
they would take a rise out of him, and cheered
him along, saying, “Go it, Stombuco; Markweli’s
just behind.” Stombuco worked on manfully to
the winning-post, and, upon raising his eyes in
triumph, whom should he see but Markwell
sitting gr nnlng, with his leg over his bicycle. It
was really too bad; but Stombuco’s only swear

It appears genuine—Finlay and Co.’s dis-

positively take place the 14th of March, 9000 out
of the 15,000 tickets having been disposed of
already. We suppose it to be bona fide, for many
reasons-among others, that the committee of
seven, are men of standing and good
report in Goulburn and its neighbour-
hood. We have endeavoured to work out the

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
Private letters say that the new Bishop
will give a decided tone—a Barrytono—to the Low
Church services at the Sydney cathedral.
Sydney Linton, Bishop-elect of Riverina,
was educated at Rugby and Wadhatn Coll., Oxon.
First clas? in cricket; second class in Law and
Mod. History. Isanextreme “evangelical.” From
’70 to'77 was vicar of Holy Trinity, Oxford; and
from ’77 to date of appointment to see of Riverina,
vicar of St. Phillips, Higham, Norwich. The Aus-
tralasian says:—“It is not long since an Austral-
asian Bishop—Bishop Solwyn, of Melanesia—was
coaching a college four on the river in Melbourne.
Perhaps we may yet have a bishop in a New South
Wales eleven.”
You can often feel through the Herald
or Echo, the feeble pulse of the sects. The Echo
says “Dr. Steel touched the cause of falling in-
terest in meetings lor united prayer in this city,
when he said that instead of meeting in a neutral
place he preferred to meet in the different
churches.” And the journal adds: “The neutral
platform neutralises everything in its presence.
That which is dos(ructive~of Churches fades before
it, and that which is common to them is colour-
less.” This is about as extraordinary an admission
as ever came from a business pulpit. On the
neutral platform there is ho Christianity according
to each sect—and what is common to them is
colourless. Just so—a colourless Christianity.
The Howl says that Evolution and Chris-
tianity “ are vitally opposed and can never bo re-
conciled.” Well, so much the worse
tion. Oh 1 and having given a concise definition
of the Creator, it tackles the angels, &c. Of them
it says “there are also numbers of spiritual exis-
tences, associated with, or disassociated from,
material forms, which have an existence of their
own given them, apaittfrom all matter.” It is as
well this vexed question is settled at last. And
again, “ It is absurd for men to profess tho Chris-
tian faith .... and to deny that God answers
frrayer in regard to wind and weather.” Are you
istenlng Dr. Moorhouse t After all, tho question
need not bo whether prayers be answered, but
whether all prayers are answered, including peti-
tions which are equally Impudent and silly, such
as demanding that Omniscience shall alter his
plans about tue weather to suit the ideas of a fool
in a white necktie.
Mr. Hevlyn Hnyter, whose habit it has
been to run the Chinese of Victoria under the
heading of Pagans, is the recipient of some mild
remonstrances. It is contented that John is
actually a Deist. Mr. Hodges, the Government
Interpreter, translates a lot of what may be called
tho book of common prayer into in-
different English to make good this contention.
Apart from the laudable desire that statistical
tables should be accurate, reasons exist for urging
Mr. Hayter, if the fact be as represented, to put
the Chinese into their proper place. Students like
to see at a glance how many people in the colony
believe that Victoria is administered subject to
Divine control. Lots ofjjthings como near being
explained when the figures can be relied on. For
instance, If the Chinese be totted up along with
believers, it will be manifest that all to a very in-
significant fraction of Ihe colony is God-fearing on
principle, and out of this circumstance will at
once bo deduced a fairly satisfactory explanation
of the political dishonesty and religious humbug
of that great division of the earth.
The Daily Telegraph (Jan. 3) expended
no inconsiderable amount of melted butter in
seeking to conciliate the Anglican subscriber by
extravagantly lauding Bishop Barry and compli-
menting the Church of England. Bishop Barry
may possibly bo all that the Telegraph says he is.
Time will tell. But what is to be said of the utterly
unfounded and astounding statement that “ the
Church of England thoroughly understands the
modern intellect, with all its doublings and ques-
tionings in regard to Important Christian verities,
and knows hOw to adapt itself thereto without
sacrificing an lota of principle or fact” ? This is,
indeed, news. For our owu part, we must con l ess
we have always been and still are under the im-
pression that the Church of England’s weakest
point was its inability to adapt itself either to the
modern intellect or the modern environment, and
that Its modern history is a record (just as its past
was) of a constant sacrifice not merely of Its lotus
but of solid juuks both of principle and fact in a
vain and hopeless endeavour to put new wine into
old skins.
The election of a member of the Order of
Jesus to the Rectorship of St. John’s College has
naturally excited the bile not merely of . vangeli-
cai Protestants, who consider the Jesuit to be
several shades blacker than the Devil of Hell, but
of a not inconsiderable section of the Catholic
community. We don t think that, qua religion
and politics, there's more real distinction between
a Jesuit and any other sort of priest than there is
betwixt an attorney and a barrister, or an alligator
and a crocodile. iHence, whether a Jesuit or a
Benedictine bossel St. John’s appears to us to he a
mere question of tweedledum andtweedledee. As
educators the Jesmts (to paraphrase Emerson) build
better than they know. Their ratw studiorum is a
splendid mental curriculum. Itapneais less to the
superstitious and more to the Intellectual than
most clerical scholastic schemes. It turned out
Descartes, Vpltaire, Mqntesquleu. Better, a thou-
sand times bettor, that there were no conventual
colleges-no 8oul-onsl%vlng clerical seminarists;
but since of two or more evils tho philosopher
chooses the least, it is bettor that young Johniana
should be under the control of an intellectually
active Jesuit than that of paunohy, three-ehluned
believers in idleness and mendicancy.
borne weeks ago, we drew attention to the
starting- of a Boys’ Club at Ultimo, the object of
which was to provide lads with a more wholesome
place of amusement than the street corner. It is
growing- rapidly, and members have Increased so
that both additional -help and funds would be
gladly received. The Club is now open every
week night except Saturday, and men and women

tary, Miss C. A. a Beckett, Arthur-strict, Ash held
Owing to the place being opened live evenings a
week, instead of two as at first, there is room lor
at least ten people (say, five of each sex) who
would be willing to give practical assistance once
a week or oftener. There Is scarcely a street
corner but has its group of boys lounging round
at night—never for good. It would bv better to
look after these than to send all the tracts in the
world to island- in the Pacific. The promoters of
the Young Australian Club do not gush over in-
teresting anddisiantdarkies, who would bo a heap
happier if left alone. They find useful work re
quiring to be done right un ler their noses, and
they turn to and do it.
A Change for City Investors.—A flrst-
class opportunity to invest in a block of real good
city prop rty and land w ill be afforded inv stors at
Mills and Pile’s msrt to-day, 'i hursday. January
17, at II30 a m. The property is that very eligible
bloca of land long occupied by Mr. J. Murphy,
corner of Kent an 1 Liverpool streets, end withiu
(saj) about cixty feet of Oeorge-sti-eet. 'imso
premises have cirriel along one of the best-
paying pawn ollices and monetary businesse-,
together with a clothes trade, to be found i u
by ney. It is splendidly situated, being on the
crest of the hill, a d is a corner block to two very
important thoroughfares The land will doubtless
be readily s ized upon by investors on the look out
lor land for factory or other similar purposes, as
all the available sites for such uses are either sold
or are fixed at figures so high as to almost preclude
purchase. The question is whether this is not a
site the Government ought to purchase at once
for public purposes, with a view to our future
railway requirements. The proprietor, Mr. J.
Murphy, being about to relinquish business and
proceed homeward on a well-earned tour, gives
the Government a chance of purchasing at a fair
figure—not an exorbitant advance, as is usually
the case. Should nothing be done in this directio.T
the property is certain to be immediately bought
up for Industrial Or business purposes.

SPECIAL ANSWER TO AN M.A. (SYDNEY UNIVER-
SITY).
No; you are In error. The comet “Pons,” Isnot
the *• aainorum ” of your youth, but belongs to a
distant branch of another family, who came over
from “space” ever so long ago, and obtained a
sort of precarious footing in the solar system. She
(they are supposed to be females, on account of
their trains) is one of a large nomadic tribe who,
liKe Irish landlords, are seldom at home. Their
claim to a place in our system is often disputed,
and they never remain long enough with us to
substantiate it properly. Once a century or so
they tneak round our way, just for a good warm,
and to show tney have no notion of relinquishing
their claim. Then they are lost sight of for years,
and we never know what doubtful liaisons they
contract when the controlling influence of the sun
who, they pretend, has such an attraction lor them,
is lessened. Their movements are altogether sus-
picious: they are the Jshmaels of the planetary
family. On many occasions they have made ad-
vances towards the sun himself, whom they claim
as their common parent. Once or twice ho ap-
peared on the point of embracing them, and the
planets—the respectable members cf the fami y
who are noted for th°ir “peaceful i evolutions ’’
or inn 1 Ige in the mildest eccentricities only—weie
anxious lest he should forget their welfare in the
tervo r of his embn ee. They are a queer lot
ectire.y, even tuis Mss Pons hatinr been away
from home for over 70 years. Of course you can
keep your eye on her; but short acquaintances ai e
best, us the blue-bottie remarked when alighting
on the flre-shovel instead of the mutton-chop.
Dr. Anna Potts has baen advising Mel-
bourne young men not to dream of entering- into
the holy bonds of matrimony with girls who wear
corsets, and that lady’s remarks have fallen like a
bomb shell in the matrimonial market. Every-
where we tear of matches being broken off,
because Adolnhus has come to the conclusion
that Angelina's waist is “too doosed small to be
quite genuine, you know." The National Gallery,
too, is crowded with mashers, taking careful tape
measurements of the torsos of the leading god-
desses, so as to get an idea of the dimensions of a
waist in its natural state. Tho result of their
researches is that they are turning up their noses
at the sylph-like forms they formerly admired,
and poor girls who have been built up on modern
principles find themselves neglected. Modest
young fellows admit that it is impossible for them
to tell for certain whether their girls wear armour
or not, so unless they can lure the little innocents
on to make the all-important disclosure, they are
bound to stand or fall by tho goddesses.
THE NEW DOCTRINE,
Bill Brown he was a baker—
Miss Mary was his mash—
His wife he wished to make her
(for Bill was young and rash);
She was loving, true, and tender.
Her big blue eye wps bright,
And her waist so very slender
That she loved to squeeze It tight.
The day was fixed, or nearly,
Which should crown his earthly bliss.
When the maid ho loved so dearly
Would no longer be a miss ;
But he read what Dr. Anna
Had been stating about s —,
And his strangely altered manner
filled his Mary with amaze.
So commenting on his coldness,
She took William B. to task.
When he said “ Excuse my boldness,
While, with bated breath, ( ask
If your waist’s within a corset?
Oh, now tell me, Mary, true.”
And she answered “ Why, of course it
Is—I always thought > ou knew."
Then spake William with emotion,
*’ Oh 1 my loving, little queen,
Once I gloried in tho notion
That your waist was ‘ seventeen,’
And felt happy in embracing
Such a small one, till I read
Of the dangers of tight-lacing,
And what Br. Anna said.
“ Now I know It must be madness
To select you for a wife,
And the one bright page of gladness
Must be blotted from my life.
Our engagement, dear, is ended,
Though my love has not decreased —
But the waist of my * intended ’
Mast be ‘ thirty-two ’ at leait.”
PATENT LIFE PRESERVER.
No swimmer should be without it. Knowledge says:—“Lives might be saved if
meu when swimming far bad a small flask of brandy round the neck. Sudden failure
of the heart’s action could then be met by a pull at the stimulant, which is also an
antidote to cramp.”

Though the sky was dull for onlookers,
yet the weather was all that could be wanted for
the Snail’s Bay regatta, and the “ Port Jackson ”
flagship was so scrupulously clean that the ladies
could spread their skirts anywhere without get-
ting them soiled. Captain Crombie was very at-
tentive, and a pretty cabin was set entirely apart
tor the fair visitors, where a dainty sideboard was
spread for them with ice-creams, claret cup, and
so on. The tine four-master is very long, and
there was a splendid promenade the wnole length,
the Vernon boys playing (and singing, too) very
creditably under Mr. Orrell, amidships. But the
poop was the favourite place, and the excitement
centred in the constant procession of boats that
came gybing close under the stern, with narrow
escapes from collision, as half a dozen sometimes
swept by together at full speed. There was an
unusual number of capsizes Mr. T. A. Dibbs’s
new yacht Ena steamed round and round, slow
and stately, part of the afternoon, but with only
about nine people aboard. The “ Port Jackson’s’’
cargo was chiefly ladies. Unmistakably charming,
though not rich, was a toilet in which the wearer
had “dressed up to” her own individuality with
great taste. It was a study in "browns.” Tne
entire dress was dark coffee brown cash-
mere, neatly fitting, with one flounce of
ottoman silk round the skirt, gloves of light brown,
and princesse bonnet of the same coloured plush
set close on a neat head of glossy golden-brown
hair, while the eyes under an entrancing little veil
were as brown as an oakleaf in autumn. Two grey
homespuns were alike neat, so was another of fools-
cap blue. At the nock of an airy green muslin, a
staring sunflower kept nodding its huge head.
Why do ladies wear such wondrous things ? Well,
there is one obvious advantage: if the young lady
shoiild “lose her head,” she'd have another one
left, about the same size and probably just as light.
Two good corded rodingote toilets were worn by
very fair sisters, black and warm slate respectively,
with lace nocklingerio and Henri Deux to match.
Another good costume was a black satin broobe
with basque edging of white lace under black,
hem of skirt the same and white pompons, hat
en suite. A beautifully fitted fawn llama buttoned
to one side, and trimmed with lace to match, made
a naturally alluring girl even more so. A number < f
white linens and lawns, flounced or not, were also
provocative of different amounts of admiration.

Since it started, the Sydney Owl Club has
been regularly growing, and Tattersall's ballroom
has been found too small for its meetings. Last
Wednesday’s Hyginx proved that the Protestant
Hall is barely large enough. There are 300 mem-
bers; and, as each member is supposed to be
interested in at least one lady, If not more, the
wearers of the silver badges alone neariy filled
the hall, without leaving room for “crows,” as
male visitors are called. A concert of two hours
came first, opening with an overture by Heed-
warbler. A lengthy member, appropriately called
Crane, recited the “ Song of the Street.” Mods.
Michel’s zither was not loud enough. Mrs. liiley,
always a favourite, sang “Heaven and Earth”;
Brigadier recited “ Hans Brietmann’s Party ”;
Bullfinch sang "Sweethearts”; Humming Bint
played from "Faust”; Mr. A. Williamson sing
the “Banks of Allan Water” sympunetically ;
and Mrs. Caddy's ballad, "The Old Barge,” was
also very sweet. A duet by Miss Roberts and
Herr Francik earned applause for her and
Herr, too. Shrike, Sheldrake, and Songster
also contributed, and Mr. T. Kainford sang
“Figaro” in fine style. Sandpiper introduced a
now song, from Burnand's “Blue Beard” opera,
called “The Mashers,” in which that esteemeu
class of persons was cruelly ridiculed. We think
that expensively got-up young men, who are very
amusing, and perfectly harmless, ought not to be
ridiculed. Readers, let us be careful of the
masher, and not annoy him. Ho might turn round
suddenly, and then his collar would cut his little
head off. Miss Creo Stanley s recitation was
“ The Mani ic,” given with such vehement realism
that she was recalled. Mr. Charles Huenerbein did
most of the accompanying, of course well. Chaii s
were soon stacked, refreshment circulated, ana
dancing began. The most dashing music (though
it was mostly good) was that of Mr. L. De Groen,
whose digitation Included his own composition,
the Owl Polka—a timely, tinkling little conceit.
Grand dresses are not expected at a hyginx; but
there wore there what, to ordinary, level-headed
observers, are better—some nice specimens of
neat simplicity. To the untutored male mind,
a grand dress is generally suggestive of some labu-
lous sum paid to some dreadful dress-making
woman; while those simple, shapely little efforts,
done up with tucks and puffs and things (and this
is another little puff, you notice), make him think
of a sewing machine in the parlour, a natty girl
building the pretty thing herself, and ’ma packing
Henry and Thomas out of the room while Angelina
“tries it on.” Well, a cherubic little form was
seductive in one of those simple whites, with a
neck-streamer—and the maiden's surname is
almost historical in Elizabeth-street. The same
street was responsible for two auburn sisters, also
as neatly garbed—one m black satin and cardinal
bows, the other in cardinal satin over cream veil-
ing; both dresses sleeveless, and very sensibly so.
A pretty Pyrmont girl was also in cardinal and
cream. A handsome married lady wore a moire
antique of subdued green, that was as handsome
as her dresses usually are; and two nieces were
very stylish in black. Another all-in-black beauty,
with a rather speedy style, was admired. A pink
zephyr, with dark-brown pompous, was tasteful.
One clever dancer was in ruby, and gold beading ;
and another In heliotrope and white. Two unique
toilets were worn by Jewish brunettes, cream
Madras muslin, very amplitudinous, and made in
the new style of gathered flounces to the waist,
with old gold Swiss belts. And then the straw-
tinted satin, with features of such delicate chisel-
ling as are seldom seen out of marble, was an East
Melbourne Jady, who bore one of the oldest
names on record ; and who also bore —well—
We scarce dare say, she bore the palm,
This Southern beauty ;
And yet we roust—now, girls, be calm—
Perform our duty.
It hurts us, just beneath our breath
To ever hint it,
And any man should suffer death
Who dares to print it.
But, Sydney matrons, dark or fair,
And maidens queenly.
Just listen now—and try to bear
The blow serenely ;
It’s no use going round about,
Our heart we harden —
The belle came from, it must come out.

We hear from Brisbane that Lady Mus-
grove dresses extremely well. At the Sports, she
wore a beautiful toilette of chocolate and straw
colour; but she carries such a funny little parasol,
just like those our grannies used to bo so lond of
—so small and old-fashioned looking. Another
nice dress there was a pale mauve surah, adorned
with cardinal ribbons; princcsse bonnet of same
colour. The bazaar which was held in the Albert
Hall in aid of All Hallows new school was a groat
success. The music was one of the attractions, as
there are a great many clever pianistes amongst
the Brisbane girls.

Mr, and Mrs. Wilkinson, of Witalaba, Yass,
gave a delightful fancy dress children’s ball on
the 10th Instant. Supper was served al fresco,
which was a groat treat in the prevailing warm
weather, and the smaller juveniles went home
about 1 o'clock, the larger remaining later. Seve-
ral sailors, one with a veritable pigtail, and soldiers
were present, throe Highland lassies, two Nor-
mandy peasants, three Christmases, a pretty
Gitana, and a dear little Page from “Jeir.” A
Yachting Girl looked nice and airy, a French
Waitress saucy (and if the Yass youths have taste
she won’t “wait” long), an Italian Girl and a
Girola lovely. America was worthy of her land,
while a Lady of the Period's eyes were charming
enough for all periods. The most e Jective male
costume was that of an Elizabethan Courtier; the
quaintest female dresses were worn by two Old
English Ladies of the 17th and 18th centuries.
About 60 guests were present, and the whole party
was an exceedingly pleasant one.

On the 9 th inst., at the pretty parish
church of Ville Marie, Hunter’s Hill, the nuptial
knot w«s tied between Mr. William Duff, of Port-
land (Vic.), and Miss Bessie, third daughter of Mr.
Thomas Jenkins, of JUvervlew, Lane Cove. The
bride looked charming in white silk and edelweiss
lace, and was attended by three maids, her sisters
Misses Mary and Annie In white, and her cousin
in pi"k. The s.s. Nellie then took about a hundred
guests to Chowder Bay, where breakfast was laid.
Mr. Alderman Qeare was chairman, and Mr. (S.
Gibson gave the chief toast. An afternoon’s
dancing followed.

Next week, the Masons (N.S.W. Constitu-

opening of their splendid new hall in Castloreagh-
street. It is the largest Masons’ Hall in Australia,
with a ball and concert room 90 by 50 feet, with
eight large doors opening outwards, and lots of
subsidiary rooms for retiring, refreshments, &o.
On Monday, the building will be consecrated by
due ceremony; on Wednesday, the Grand Master
banquets the Melbourne visiting “ team ” ; on
Thursday, there will be a ball; on Friday, a public
Masonic banquet; and on Saturday, a harbour
picnic. They will be all grand, as befits the high
occasion.

Last week, Captain B. F. Sanclernan. son
of Captain Sandeman, of the 43nd Highlanders,
English Army, was married to Miss Georgina,
eldest daughter of Mr. R. J, Jeffrey, of Toorak
(Vic.) It was a very aristocratic affair. The bride,
given away by her father, wore a splendid white
satin with only two line lace flounces; and the six
bridesmaids (Misses Jeffrey, Fairbairn, Wilkie,
Morphy, and Simpson) all wore India mull muslin
with waterfall bacas, and muslin caps. Lords
Rosebery and Nevill were among the guests.
Lady Clarke wore cream satin combined with pale
blue check, and bonnet with pale blue feathers:
Mrs. Malleson’s toilet was pale lavender kilted
underskirt and lace, and a polonaise of black satin
and white lace; Mrs. Donald Wallace wore tartan
satin and Langtry bonnet, and looked lovely
enough to justify the flattering title bestowed on
her over the border of a second Jersey Lily. The
steps, porch, and aisle of the Scot’s Church were
carpeted, and full choral service was performed.
The bridegroom is a relative of the Sandeman
family in Sydney, and, as romance goes, Cupid’s
lirst shafts went home when, ns a ministering
angel on his couch of sickness on the rolling waves,
he met the fair and wealthy girl who is now his
bride. The groomsmen were Messrs. Blackwood,
Russell, and Sandeman, all well known, and Mr.
Wolseley, of Thule, who settled the “box-seat
difficulty ” la Riverina, and is brother of a General.
On Saturday last, a pleasant gathering
took place at Ferncourt, North Willoughby, the
residence of Mr. B. T. Newell, when Miss Con-
stance Graham Walsh, the youngest daughter of
the late Captain J. S. Walsh, Government Pilot at
South Head, was wedded to Mr. Arthur Malcolm-
Moore, by the Rev. U. M'Kinnon. The bride came
forth in a gauzy, feathery robe of pure white,
without colour or jewellery, and hair taken up
skywards The “ single ” bridesmaid boro herself
with becoming dlgnitv, and after the Wedding
March, the company adjourned for breakfast, and
the toast of bride and bridegroom was given by
Mr. M‘K.innon, who, as he had neverseenthe bride
till that day, contented himself by observing that
her beauty burst on his astonished view like a
large happy sunflower. It was a critical strait,
and he had to say something. After a little danc-
ing, the bride re-appeared in her travelling dress
—light grey, and a hat, the “only Henri,” of
course, and the now pair started for Katoomba;
rice, apparently, being an article of no value
among her friends, dome pretty drosses wore
seen. Mr*. F, U. Treatt (sister of the bride; wore a
nice navy blue cashmerotte; another sister, Mrs.
Newel, ,i pretty cream; and a third, black satin.
The mother of the groom wore light grey: and
Mrs. Fowler, her daughter, black silk and satin, &c.

linghurst on Monday evening. The Headmaster
is Mr. S. J. Hardy. The school is one of the
finest in the country, cost some £15,000, and a large
number of ladies and gentlemen gathered there,
besides 30o0 children, who were granted a holiday
to got over their grief at the Minister's absence.

But it is in the University Hall, on Satur-
day, the 19th, that the—wo were almost writing
“ boss,” a word these cultivated people would not
understand-really fashionable event of the season
takes place. It is to be a concert, with Sections of
professionals and battalions of amateurs, a. retsco-
mannistow. ve the baton; and Turner-Montague,
the Metropolitan Liedertafel, and a crowd of
fashionables have promised to follow wherever he
leads. There is to be a full orchestra, and every
selection is a bonne bouche. Beethoven has been
“ requisitioned ’’ for the first part, while the second
portion is miscellaneous. A lady amateur is down
for the C minor concerto. The Pastoral Symphony,
and a quartette from “ Fidelio,” should be beard
to advantage. And yet wo have our misgivings.
If ever there was a writer whose wo ks charm the
cofjnnscenli, and bewilder the unmusical, it Is
Beethoven—always, of course, barring Wagner.
How often, at a classical concert, while the trip-
lets of the “Moonlight” were falling on the ear
like the ripple of distant waters, have we seen
how the honest tradesmen and their portly wives,
occupying the front seats, kept up an accompani-
ment of nods, just waking up to clap, and cry
“ Ancoro.”

Christopher Newton, Esq.
On the front, page of our issue this week appears
a portrait of Mr. Christopher Newton, a tho-
roughly worthy representative of the mercantile
community of this country. There is, probably, no
single Individual identified with commerce in these
Earts of whose stability and integrity the public
ave had such solid proof. Mr. Newton was born
at Hexham, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in 1818, and re-
ceived a thoroughly sound English education,
fitting him for mercantile pursuits. At an early
age he entered a soft-goods house, and shortly
after arriving here, in 1840, he was able to start a
business of this description, which won him con-
siderable success. Occupied for a time in the
retail trade, Mr. Newton saw an opening for a
vigorously conducted importing house, and on
this wider basis exactly 32 years ago, he established
a house next the present Koyal Hotel, in George-
street. The house ran into a sound and prosper-
ous trade, soon occupying almost the first position
among similar enterprises. In the height of suc-
cess, however, the firm suddenly became involved
in the most serious difficulties, Insolvency being
Inevitable. It appears that the resident London
partner drew numerous bills, which cast the firm
In losses to the extent of many thousands of
pounds. These bills Mr. Newton honoured; but
was forced to compound, paying the creditors lis.
in the £. This arrangement entirely freed him
from his financial responsibilities, and Mr, Newton
resumed business with fresh energy. After some
years of further success in George-street, the firm
reuloved, ten years ago, to the splendid premises
in Pitt-street, which they have ever since occu-
pied. Mr Newton, now being sole proprietor,
reconstructed the firm by taking in his three sons
and two sons in-law. the title of the new firm
being “ Christopher Newton, Sons, and Company,”
though business is carried on until the title of
“Christopher Newton, Brother, and Company.’’
Having thus virtually retired from the business—
or, at least, from its active management—Mr.
Newton determined to carry out what had long
been his firmest resolve. Two years ago, be
Sroceeded to England, ostensibly to enjoy a tour*
ut really on mom serious business. Arriv-
ing in London, be met all the creditors in the
estate of the old firm, and to these from his
private purse he made good the deficiency—the
total reaching near upon £40,000. Mr. Newton was
the only member of the old firm remaining; and
though financially free from such obligation, yet
was determined io do his own name justice, and
leave to bis successors a business of untarnished
reputation. In recognition of this uprightness,
the creditors of the estate spontaneously ban-
queted Mr. Newton, and subscribed a sum of 2000
as a testimonial to him—the presentation, when
being made, being distinctly stated to be
from the mercantile and manufacturing com-
munity of England. The lund of £2000 was de-
voted to the very suitable purpose of purchasing a
splendid steam yacht. At the same time that this
presentation took place, a handsome gift of dia-
mond jewellery of rare value was made to Mrs.
Newton. It may here bo mentioned that the lady
just spoken of, to whom Mr. Newton was married
in 1847, is the daughter of the late Mr T ohn Black-
man, one of the business pioneers of Sydney.—
The yacht with which Mr. Newton was presented
has been sketched by our artist and will,
with a description, appear in our next issue.
It is designed on the latest approved prin-
ciples, and is furnished with machinery from
the celebrated firm of English engineers, Messrs.
Bow, M'Laughlln, and Co., Paisley. The work of
construction was carried out at the yards of Mr.
Dunn, marine architect and builder, of Berry’s
Bay, Port Jackson. The yacht is 69 feet over all,
with corresponding breadth of beam, and is one oi
the handsomest additions our colonial yachting
fl?et has received. A silver plate is to be fixed in
the launch and to bear the following inscription: —
“ This Steam Launch (accompanied by a diamond
ring and silver bracelet for Mrs. Newton) was pre-
sented to Christopher Newtofi, Esq., by a number
of British manufacturers and merchants, as a mark
of their sincere esteem, and of their deep sense of
his honourable dealings with them during a long
and arduous commercial career.—John Scott (on
behalf of the subscribers). Oct. 19, 1882.”

Political Points
Somebody suggests that a society should
be started for the purpose of putting- down heavy
eating and drinking- at public banquets. The Idea
is a good one politically.
The Tamworth Observer reports that the
Government are granting free passes to parents
(Narrabri residents) desirous of taking their chil-
dren out of town during the hot weather. Why
Ihpuld Narrabri people be picked out for the
privilege ? What is s i uce for an up-country town
should certainly be sauce for an overcrowded
metropolis.
A Jingo cablegram from the Herald
“ The decision of Mr. Gladstone to continue to de-
fend Egypt has reassured public opinion, especially
as it is believed that the decision is the prelud--
to an entire British civil administration.” A
correct interpretation of British public opinion
would be this:—The whole English Radical party
maintain that the recurrence of serious difficulties
in Egypt, which will yet cost the country both
men and money, prove that British interference
was unwise, and that Arabi ought have been
allowed to cut the Khedive’s ears off.
Douglas, Mayor of Launceston, and
FipffaJi means to move a resolution in
Assembly to the following effect:
— That the Van Diemen’s Land Co.’s 350 000 acres
of land, or thereabouts, assessed at the annual
value of £3300, and paying a duty of £83 10s. an-

CHUCKLES.
Bobby Byrne gives us, in Queensland
Punch, an “illcgaiit” notice of our Christmas
number. Hesays: “ The literary merit ot Bhostly
Gold’ is very high of The Bulletin type. (i Ihis
is ‘‘praise* from Sir Hubert Stanley, indeed. We
hare received a copy of “ Chuckles, m the Christ-
mas number of Brisbane Punch. \Vcc°tisider its
merit is “ very high” of the (hem!) Brisbane , ench
type. There is no satire in this—only a little good
humour; and this is (or was) the season to bo good-
nurnoured. It is easier, just after Christmas, to be
humorous than satirical. This, we conceive, is
chiefly owing to goose. Humour is born of goose,
but not satire. Bmrding-bouse stuffing, it is true,
possesses -as do Phillip-street baked potatoes-a
kind of grotesque humour of its own ; but,
though that humour is grotesque, and even spec-
tral, there is little, itjany, satire about it. featiro is
suggested by a semblance of something that is keen
and sharp-pointed. There is no property of any-
thing, solar as we can learn, to e nco u rag e sat i re
about goose, or about stuffing, or about Phullp-
street baked potatoes. The young commercial
gentleman of poetical proclivities r.t Todgers s, it
is true, wrote a satirical ode ‘‘On the Ireezlng of
the Tank at the back of the House, ' which, it will
be remembered, he read, with considerable appro-
bation, to the Pecksmlf family during the awlul
pause that preceded the serving up of that memor-
j.ble banquet. But, then, we are not blessed
with that poetical gentleman's peculiar talents.
We had a poet once, who could write you little
satirical things on anything. Ho could .be
especially satirical on his landlord when Saturday
atternoon came round. Ho was more than satiri-
cal at those times ; he was biting. But he is gone,
for the present; he has (and we do not say this
without regret) temporarily faded, Wo dent
mind telling you, in an item that must not be
bruited abroad, that we have let him out fork,
spell. We sent him on ono occasion where the
wattle gold bloomed-he said he would be happy
there—but he arrived at th- office three days
afterwards on a shutter. Ho then wished subse-
quently to sing about the waterlalls musical
cadence—and, so, alter some consideration, we
gave him another chance. This tune h© didn t
come homo at ail. We relented once more, how-
ever, and paid his fine lor him; and when ho ex-
pressed a desire to sing about the rhythmic ripples
of the ocean, we pensively acquiesced, This en-
tailed inexpensive board at Manly, but it has ever
been the principle of this journal to be reckless in
point of legitimate expenditure, and we did not,
on this occasion, shrink from our established
rule. Every odor that respect and admiration
could suggest of lo diner PctrisicH, when ho was
past eating anything but rum, wasmot wanting;
and so far as the tap went, prior to freighting the
steamer with him, the supply of water which was
furnished to our bard was practically unlimited.
He expressed bis gratitude for the shower as well
as he could, but, being somewhat paralysed by the
novelty ot water in any form, his eloquence from
a poetic point of view, anyhow, was somewhat
hampered by limits. He sang about the rhythmic
ripples of the broad Pacific tor three whole days,
and possibly throe nights, too: then wo heard ot
him. This was through the medium ot his land-
lord. That inestimable citizen called round and
asked us if we knew any magistrate who could,
upon the shortest notice, call out the miutary.
He stated that on the second day of our bard s re-
sidence at his house, ho had read the Kiot Act m
his deepest tones, but the result even ot that im-
pressive composition did not militate against our
poetic representative either making a tunnel ot
the parlour clock or continuing for four conse-
cutive hours to bark at the boarders. When sub-
sequently put, by the combined force of the whole
establishment, into the showor-bath, he scandalised
the people by composing impromptus upon the
origin of the Bath in Home (as he held it) and the
River Jordan, where, it will be remembered, King
Naaman bathed and was cured (as the legend goes)
of leprosy. Mark Twain seems to say, by the way,
that Naaman never had anything but prickly heat,
and that ono day when he (Mark Cwam) was
thirsty he drank one half of the Rivet Jordan
dry, and took the balance away in a quart-pot.
This is digression* anyhow; but it leads us, in a
way, back to our poet. WelJ, we have let him out
to a man who keeps a farm; ho draws water, and
wo draw his wages. It was by this arrangcme n t
that wo were enabled to afford to have all those
pretty vases and balustrades placed on top
new palace. By last accounts of him, we heard
he was browsing satisfactorily on turnips, and had
written, in melting strains, the Cadenza of the
Carrot.” It seems now that he is fixed;
hope ho is; but wo are ;- nevertheless, doubtful
Why, it is not long ago since we shm him up, tor
the safety of the community (or, rafk®'
a delicate touch here—the sanity the
nity) in the deepest dungeon within the R e ® e Ption
House, and ordered him to be leaded with as many
fetters as Dam pier wears in Jean Vauean. I hat
night we wont to the Royal, in the d jess circle,
and he was there—right in the f ®
row, leading the laughter, and evidently oblivious
of his whereabouts. But, as ho appeared happy,
we loft him there. We heard, next day, t h athe
didn’t sit out the performance. A s ®rgeant came
there, and claimed his acquaintanceship. Our poet
couldn't see it, and, to our confusion, we were
subsequently informed that he was not persuaded
to come out until ho had performed a perfect
Catherine wheel with two shoes. one wu™
pockethaudkerehief, and a very | k “ e “
ho came round to the office next day he was like a
Scotch plaid. You con id see one eye, becauseit
stood out about two feet; thoughJibe other, for
all vnu • on Id behold of it, might have been—as
very likely it was - at the back of his head; so we
decided to rusticate our bard tor the present.
Well, after all this gentle little gossip, let us
reciprocate Bobby's Pl-asani notice by saying
that his "Chuckles” (“great head in using
the title of the year before last! which was
written by a feeble creature in this country)
is very nice, indeed. We may seem to speak
of it tis though it were pudding; but wo like
pudding. There is a story written by Mi. H car-
gill in “Chuckles,” that contains a passage which
possesses a good many points, each pfwhmhhasa
fair claim to be considered remarkable. Here is
an instance Hardly r had the skipper done

it to instant consideration. Ihis is all wo dare, tor
prudent reasons, to insert in the first forme. «o

A New Cate In Pitt-street, Sydney.
The wants of Sydney are at last in a fair way of
toeing attended to. The latest proof in this direc-
tion la the opening 1 of a caf<5 and restaurant by
Baumann, a talented French artist in the cuisine
lino, the locality being those extensive premises,
107 Pitt-street, almost directly opposite the Union
Bank, and about four doors from Hunter-street.
The promises were formerly use* 1 by Messrs.
Harris and Ackman as a gallery, show-room, and
auction mart. Under the very capable design of
Mtssrs. Martin and Bussell, architects, of 19
Hunter-street, the edifice has undergone a magic
obangc The work, in fact, indicates a distinctly
new school of architecture, which may be hailed
with pleasure, for there is nothing like the place in
any of the colonies. The work of alteration is not
vet completed, but the establishment has been
opened to meet pressing requests, and the business
has been extraordinarily successful. A full archi-
tectural description must be left for another
occasion. It will now suffice to say that the
various dining halls or rooms are of great depth
and width, with unusual height of ceiling, securing
magnificent ventilation. The decorations of the
coiling arc of rich hand-painting, the work of
Signor Loienzeni. the effect produced being of
the highest artistic character. There will bo
special saloons for ladies and children, with dress-
ing-rooms, &c. attached. At the roar of the
dining-rooms will be an expansive banqueting-
had richly decorated, affording accommodation
to fully 300 people. The cuisine is under the per-
sonal supervision of Mr. Baumann himself, so that
In that respect also there will always be an attrac-
tion that is bound to be recognised by the Sydney
public in a right and liberal way
The Increasing Demand for Pyrmon
Stone.
It is only a few days ago since there was a dis-
cussion in the Press as to the relative durability of
stone and bricks, the discussion being opened by a
Sydney architect stating that Sydney sandstone
was very porous, and by no means weatherproof
or durable. As “ Sydney sandstone ” included, of
course, the best Pyrmont quarry productions, Mr.
Kobert Saunders replied in a very smart letter, in
which he completely turned the tables on his an-
tagonist. The architect, in support of his state-
ments, referred to the University, the Unitarian
Church, St. James' Cathedral : and the walls
of G eorge-street Markets, but though his
lacts as to the condition of the walls ot those
buildings were correct, the instances quoted were
by no means fair ones. Mr. Saunders conceded
that the surface sandstone of the quarries, used
yean ago before the present deep bottoms were
opened or known, was porous and soft, but he
stakes £100 for the public charities if the writer
could find a single drip stone in all the present
deep quarries, .besides, the stone in these build-
ing's came from Cockle Bay and elsewhere, and
not Pvrmont at all. Mr. Saunders likewise pointed
out that as far as tests were concerned, his ex-
hibits of the best Pyrmont hard block stone were
awarded first prize and medal at the Melbourne
and Amsterdam Exhibitions — and this against
numerous other exhibits. The reply to this
“cornerer” from Mr. Saunders was that the
best Pyrmont freestone ” wasn’t referred to
at all. Still, the writer continued to speak of
Sydney sandstone, mentioning, as a general
sample, the refuse used for pavement and gutter-
ing work in the city. The Pyrmont champion,
however, fixed th© writer to his first statements,
and then proved that what he had based all his
objections on was a surface stone, now used only
for fllllng—a stone no more to be compared to the
products of the deep quarries ot Pyrmont than
the ordinary brick is to adamant. And it will be
admitted by the general public, who have ocular
proof in every street in Sydney, that it was absurd
to advocate brick in preference to stone. The
vitrifled brick, it is admitted, is of great imper-
viousness, but certainly it does not surpass the
hard blocks of granite-like stone from Saunders s
Blackwattlo Bay quarries, Pyrmont—which stone
is going in thousands of tons, day by day, to re-
build and beautify the cities of Sydney and Mel-
bourne. What has been done in the latter city
may be seen in the splendid new warehouses of
Tanaye Bros, Melbourne, and in the new E. and A-
Chaitered Bank for Melbourne ; yet more will
be seen, 44.000 feet of hard yellow Pyrmont stone
havinsr been ordered from Mr. Saunders. Ihe
letters of the writer referred to appear to indicate
an advocacy for some special description of brick.
However, since the discussion has taken place,
orders from Melbourne for near upon 60,000 feet
of Pvrmont stone have been received by Mr.
Saunders, who iinds it of manifest advantage to
hi* ousinessto have the product of his quarries
criticised by people who may mean well, but don t
know.
Patent Portable Gas for Inland Towns,
Hotels, Stations, &c
About eighteen months ago attention was drawn
in these columns to the Patent Portable Gas, the
practical adaptability of which for use in hotels,
nomes, inland towns, &c., was at once apparent.
The company did a very great business, the public
quickly recognising that the Patent Portable Gas
was cheap, safe, and more brilliant than even coal
eras. A large trade was done with all the inland
towns, and Avith suburban and country home-
steads, and suburban and country churches, halls,
theatres, &c. One of he men who had the prac-
tical management of the whole thing Avas Mr. D.
Keeley, a competent and enterprising mechani-
cian; and, dissatisfied with existing arrangements,
he opened business in the line on his oAvn account,
being joined in this undertaking by others. The
patent portable gas which Messrs. Keeley and Co.
send out has six times the brilliancy of kerosene,
at half its cost. It is in no way dangerous, being
incombustible; it is clearer than coal gas,
and is at all times available. An hotel, for in-
stance —say, at Dubbo —can be brilliantly lighted
with chandeliers. Avail lights, outside lamps, icc..
ten times more brilliantly than with kerosene, and
the cost is beloiv what'is paid in Sydney for coal
gas. Pour double chandeliers will light a church
oetter than six four-branch kerosene lamps—and
the gas burns with a clear, steady flame, casting
no perceptible heat, or emitting no offensive
smell. With this portable gas at command, no big
shop in any inland toivn need be dim as a tunnel,
bur rather be as brilliantly lighted as any bouse m
Sydney. Arrangements can easily be made with
Municipalities tor the lighting of towns, the
patent portable gas having been successfully used
by the Government at Croydon, and at other rail-
Avay stations on the Southern end Western lines.
The feature about this portable gas is that a burn-
ing lamp may be carried in the hand all OA'er the
nouse Avith absolute safety; or it may be used
down a mining shaft, or in the street, with equal
safety and facility. Messrs. D. Keeley and Co. are
the only firm who have permission from the in-
surance companies for the use of their materials
in houses, stores, &c., holding policies from them.
Thus, if other material is used, people do so at
their own risk. Keeley and Co, have now many
new varieties of lamps for halls,
ball-rooms, &c., the cheapest, neatest, and safest
articles of the kind ever designed. Pamphlets,
&c., will be promptly sent on application to
Messrs. D. Keeley and Co., 71 Goulburn-street.
Second-hand Machinery Depot and Agency.
One of the m-'st useful branches of business
established in Sydney of late is that of
John M‘Hao and Co., of Market Wharf, who have
opened an extensive depot for the sale of second-
hand machinery of all kinds. This is a great era-
porium, where every firm in the metropolis or the
country districts may forward such machinery as
they have no longer in use, and here is the spot
whence the man about to make a start in business
of any kind can obtain inexpensive appliances in
good working order, serviceable for years, adapted
for any industry or works in course of develop-
ment. Many linns in Sydney have long a
means of disposing of machinery displaced by more
powerful or swifter apparatus, and it of ten occurs
that a firm are using machinery which they would
be glad to dispose of to a buyer in order to admit
of the introduction of better plant. M Kae & Co. s
agency provides the means whereby numbers or
appliances and machinery of all kinds can be for-
warded to the stores for display—with regard to
others, the firm Swill receive for sale without
removal any article for disposal. Thus a man with
a 3 h.p. engine, who wishes to obtain a 6 h.p., may
keep the former in riperation till a customer is
found by Messrs. M‘Rae & Co.’s agency; and the
chances of sale through this agency are a thousand
to one against those of private sale. As the firm s
business is well established, buyers of every des-
cription are in daily communication with the firm
for materials in request, and 10,000 catalogues are
put out every month. And their catalogue is a
substantial, well-arranged thing—a regular boon
to people who want to sell and those who want to
buy good second-hand appliances There is a
simple index to the catalogue, and each article has
its price fixed, so that a buyer knows what he is
1 about. The catalogue for sale includes—a great
variety of wood-working machinery, steam-
pumps, numerous steam engines of all sizes, lathes,
belting, saws, drills, gas engines, brick-making
machinery, quartz-crushing plant, agricultural
and general farming appliances, vehicles, wag-
gons, schooners, yachts, &c. No charges made for
storage —commission only on sale—catalogues will
be promptly forwarded. Messrs. M Rao and Co.
are to be complimented on their enterprise, and it
is satisfactory to find it meets with increasing
public approval. Country consignments of second-
hand machinery, &o., will be received at the rail-
way or steamer, and removed free of charge to
the front stores in Kent or Market streets.
The most ancient instrument of punish-
ment was a Cain, and its effect was to spoil an
Abel youth.
The “lawyer” vine of the Northern
scrubs, is the most diabolical instrument of tor-
ture the vegetable world has produced, barring
the stinging tree. On the Bus?eli Biver there are
patches of twenty or thirty acres here and there,
covered solely by “lawyer. The surveyors are
terror-stricken in the prcsence of this terrific
plant. It is indescribable. The bore and foliage
of the lawyer is handsome, and, there is a certain
grace about the long fllamental cane shoots that
are thrown out, sometimes to a length of lw or 15
feet, and hang like pendants over the bridle
tracks and old timber roads, thirsting for some
one to come along* that they may grab him, ana
hear him make the local welkin ring wBh sulphure-
ous profanity. The main vine attains an astound-
ing length, and on the lower Mulgravo Eiyer, we
have seen lawyers at least four or five hundred
feet long, running up one tre e. across on to.an-
other, thence down and along the ground in all
sorts of fantastic shapes. On the mam vine there
are no obstructions, only the outlying shoots be-
1 ing* covered by the needle-pointed teeth teat are
turned all in towards the mam plant, so that it is
useless to attempt to escape by pulling ahead.
These slender vines are as strong as wires, and the
teeth are Immovable. No man living, whatever
the nature of his religious training, or the num-
her of Sunday schools and Y.M.C. Associations he
has frequented, could resist the tremendous incen-
tive to fiery phraseology, whenho flrffimterviews
a sound, healthy lawyer. Wo bad a proof■
statement in the experienceof a
who was travelling from Cairns to Herberton. In
making a short cut across a bend of the road, a
• lawyer ’’ was drawn with disastrous effect across
the bridge of his nose. In a spasmodic attempt at a
back somersault another one hooked him by the
left tar, while two more started successfully to
ventUate the back of his shirt. In the contest
that ensued between the man of God and old
Nick’s ve etable emissary, the future citizen of
Zion was pulled off his astonished steed and found
himself entangled beyond all apparent hope of
ever being extricated wlthoutsome miraculous
interposition of an ever-watchful Divine Provi-
dence. In the darkest moment of dire extremity
he uttered but one sentence, a fervent Oh
Lord, this is the ciamnedst device of Satan on
the face of the earth I” Subsequently he re-
marked to the packer who accompanied him : I
feel sure in the sight of Heaven that nothing but
a religious training and Christian precepts pre-
vented mo from uttering some word
during my struggle with that terrible vine.
Says Bishop Barry:—“ As to the man who
is born in a free country like England.and does
not identify himself enough with it tp take the
share which the constitution gives him in shaping
its destinies—I confess that such a one does not
seem to me to be more than half a man, and I do
not believe he is half an Englishman.’’ Surely
this is (if ever there was one) an indictment
against more than half a nation, seeing that the
British Constitution condemns an enormous per-
centage of its free-born (?) sons to be the vote-less
hall men tbe.Bishop sneers at W c&ihcdTO,.
Messrs. E. Prosser and Co., Wholesale
Druggists, &c.
The well-known firm of wholesale importing and
manufacturing druggists, Messrs. B. Prosser and
Co., who have been carrying on business tor some
years on the premises, Pitt-street, between the
Post Office and King-street, have taken those ex-
tensive warehouses, 19 and 21 O’Connell-stroet,
almost adjoining the Herald office. These pre-
mises are of recent erection, being hunt of the
best Pyrmont stone, and are among the hand-
somest which characterise new Sydney. They are
of the most substantial character, and comprise
two warehouses of five expansive floors, being
particularly suited to the requirements of Messrs.
Prosser and Co.’s business. Another feature Is
that the situation is in the heart of the city, being
within a few feet of Pitt-street, yet out of the
way of the crush of vehicular traffic in that
thoroughfare—a great desideratum for a firm, the
receipt and removal of whose goods is going along
throughout the day. Messrs. Prosser and Co. ran
now lay claim with their new spacious warehouses
to almost the first position among the importing
and manufacturing druggists of these colonies ;
indeed, it has been remarked by English visitors
that really there are no houses of more notable
extent in London. The two warehouses are con-
nected by several arches—one on each floor—
which are rendered fire-proof by means of stout
sliding flre-proof iron doors. When these arches
are open, a capital opportunity is afforded
the spectator of observing the wide ex-
tent of the warehouse interior. And now
a brief description of that interior. The cellars,
which comprise Jan area of 110 ft. by 60ft. .are on
the solid rock, yet are asphalted with the best
material. They afford storage rooin tor one of
the largest bulk stocks to be found in any one
house in the colonies, and from here every depart-
ment in the warehouse receives its supplies, a
powerful lift, operated on by gas engine, being
devoted to the purposes of removal. There are
improved conveniences here for the workmen;
and at the western end are departments receiving:
large supplies of water, for bottle-washing 1 , clean-
ing, &c., and for the storage of leeches. On the
ground floor are facilities for the receipt and re-
moval of goods from the drays and trollies, and
this, likewise, is devoted to the storage of whole
packages, the stock of chemists and druggist s
goods generally representing some thousands ot
pounds. The great feature of the warehouse is
the show room on the first floor, which is reached
bv a wide, handsome, cedar stairway. This room
shows by far and away the best display of any
similar warehouse in Australia, having a kreat
range, splendid light, and being furnished with
numerous show cases, displaying druggists sun-
dries, surgical instruments, patent medicines,
samples of the new hand-painted china toilet ware,
and perfumery of every description. At the eastern
end is a spacious, well-lighted counting-
house furnished in capital style, with tele-
phonic exchange, &o. The offices of the pro-
prietary are situated at the eastern end of
the adjoining warehouse, and are similarly
furnished. The whole of the northern warehouse
is taken up with the largest display of druggists
goods, arranged after the retail style, the effect
being as striking as it is unique and labour-
saving. The shelving extends the whole length of
the building, and is as lofty as the ceiling. Here,
the great principle of the firm’s business is in full
operation—business being done with only those in
the trade, people who have to sell again. At the
end of this department is one for the open stock
of spirits. &o., in bulk, and away to the right are
cloak rooms, lavatories, &c. On the second flooi
are bottling and labelling rooms, arrangements
being made for the employment of dexterous
iuvenile labour. There is a great display here
also of the open stock of glass for druggists, &e.
On the third floor is a spacious manufactory and
laboratory, fitted with the latest appliances, with
power by pulley from the gas engine for driving
She drug mills, &c The whole of this department
i-, floored with sheet-iron, and is brilliantly lighted.
Th© northern warehouse is devoted to the storage
of large parcels of corks and other similar
material. Tbe firm of Prosser and Co are
among the largest Importers of chemicals, drugs,
patent medicines, &c., in the colony; and the steps
they are now taking: in securing commodious
warehouses will enable them to occupy the front
rank in their lino of At Prosser and Co. s
may be found one of the largest stocks to be found
in any house in the colonies In respect of patent
medicines, drugs, chemicals, dye goods, fancy
soaps, sponges, &c., and a large and special busi-
ness done is in surgical instruments, almost every
latest pattern or design being represented in the
show-cases. Brushware is another important item
ii the Arm’s business. The house has long been
known throughout this colony and Queensland
for the rare excellence of its photographic chemi-
cals. to which department the greatest attention
is given. The firm is likewise Jthe representative
house in Sydney as regards cordial makers machi-
nery the makes of the latest and most approved
natterns being shown-several for the first time in
Sydney. Within the last few weeks, Messrs.
Prosser and Co. have received several large ship-
ments of new stock, which is now open for inspec-
tion at their O’Connell-street warehouses. Visitors
to Sydney per train, take tram to Hunter-street,
and thence to the warehouses in three minutes.
Thus the “ Meddler,” in the Sydney Maid,
on “hack-block’ evils They are only assaulted
bv indolence, licentious talk, gambling, the seduc-
tions of the shanty (if there chances to be one
near )_vlces gross enough, perhaps; but not so
terrible as the secularist’s doubt or unbelief.
When Tennyson wrote his panegyric on Honest
doubt,” he little dreamt that a meddling Solon of
Hunter-street would dub it as more terrible than
—what? “Indolence, licentious talk, gambling,
I the seductions of the shanty I’ Verily, these
Hunter street religionists are fearfully and won-
derfully constituted! Scarcely one good, great,
enlightened man has ever fought the battle of life
i w ho was not to the very end imbued with more
or less “ honest doubt ” on those subtle mysteries
which the little-minded, ignorant, religious pedant
settles as airily and irreverently as he would the
total of his butcher’s or baker s bill. It is such
teachings'as the “Meddler’s” that disgust true
intelligent men with so-called religion, and the
absurd pretensions of its creeds. In truth, we
want an association for the defence of Christianity
—not from freothought or secularism, but from
the assaults of the bigotry, sectarianism, and dog-
matic absurdities sown and fostered by pseudo*
disciples of Christ.

Thus “ Ouida” (in a letter to the London
Times) in vindication of tho realism of the situa-
tions of her novels—situations which she com-
plains are too often called “outre and Impossible”:
“ Why are not those who can love and suffer thus
as deserving of pourtrayal in fiction as the epicene
beings who know no woes but a passing hysteria
of conscience or a disillusion before the melting
of a foggy and impalpable ideal ? Because passion
has never touched with its fire and its glory tho
prim life of the msthetic prig or the rotund
Philistine, it is not for that reason perished off the
face of tho earth. It exists in tho same force and
the same fervour as in the days of Othello and
8tradella To many of us—to myself, I
confess, among the number—tho world seems a
marvellous union of tragedy and comedy, which
run side by side like twin children; like a ‘ wob of
Tyrian looms’ with the gold threads crossing
and recrossing on the dusky purple of its
intricate meshes. But there are, no doubt,
a number of good and tiresome people to whom it
seems only a Quaker mute, a suit of homespun, a
length of huckaback ; they judge by what they
have known themselves. How is one to persuade
them that their knowledge is not the measure of
the world ? The amorous, magnificent, heroic life
of Skoboloff would, no doubt, seem incredible to
the London litterateur with his prim domesticities
bound up in a duodecimo suburban villa, papered
by Morris, or tho rural clergyman solemnly pacing
his treadmill of weekly monotonies ; but Michael
Skobeloff was just as ‘real’ as are the modern
Puff and Wormwood going up and down in their
underground railway trains, or the Reverend
Crawleys surrounded with their olive branch«s in
muddy midland vintages.” Wo side with “ Ouida”
in her tilt against the fictitious realism of tho
spineless commonplace. Truth is, indeed, much
Stranger than fiction. What novelist of tho “ prim
domesticity ” school, for Instance, would ever
Idealise such a situation as this : a young labourer
seduced by his master’s daughter declining to
marry her on religion# grounds, after admitting
the paternity of thair child I Yet Grafton
(N.S.W.) papers report such a situation as a recent
local fact.
The Salvation Army of Victoria celebrated
its first “anniversary ” at tho Exhibition Building,
Melbourne, on Now Year’s Bay; and considering
that some 18,000 people paid one shilling each for
admission to tho “services,” a very profitable
anniversary it must have proved—for the rent of
tho building, including gas, is a mere song. £900
(independent of a liberal profit from the sale of
light refreshments, and tho moneys thrown upon
the platform under the excitement of a sort of
mad dervish dance gone through by the “officers”)
is no inconsiderable sum to be netted in one day;
and the high glee displaying Itself upon tho ill-
favoured countenances of these gentlemen was
very natural, under tho circumstances. This,
however, can hardly be accepted as an excuse for
tho larrikinism that was rampant among the
“stall'” at the big evening “service,” when the
spectacle of two “ captains ” dancing about the
platform, with their arms about one another’s
necks, was hideously revolting to such as are not
yet “saved.” A habit of cuddling one another
appears, by tho way, to be a distinguishing trait
among members of the “ Harmy; ” for a pugilistic-
looking “stalf sergeant,” after roughly embracing
"Major” Barker and the Kev. Mr. Horsley (who
looked particularly uncomfortable under the en-
dearment), was so filled with the “spirit” that he
felt forced to relieve his feelings by rushing for-
ward t© a drivelling old party who was testifying,
and by roughing up his hair with both hands-a piece
of horseplay wnicn provoked thunders of “ Halle-
lujahs” from admiring friends. Strange to say,
among the many “ testimonies ” that wore given,
there was not one of a financial character. No
balance-sheet was read. Nor did a “lieutenant,”
for instance, who held forth at considerable length,
explain how it is that a salary of one pound per
week enables himself and wife to keep up such a
well-fed appearance as they both presented. Surely
a few hints on domestic economy, from such a
thrifty soldier, would have been invalu ibleto any
young couples just starting housekeeping. Tho
while that these “testimonies ’ were being
screamed out from tho front of tho platform, any
amount of blasphemous “chaff” was interchanged
in an undertone among the uniformed larrikins,
massed together at the aide, affording ample proof
to any “outsider” taking the trouble to get a
place among them, of the rottenness of the whole
business. However, the paying public in front,
who could hear none of their “ pleasantries,” evi-
dently regarded those mountebanks as splendid
specimens of redemption. Another noteworthy
feature of the evening “service” was the “faint-
ing” of one of the girls on the platform, who,
proving impervious to all efforts to bring her to,
was carried away in the arms of two “soldiers.”
With her arm round one fellow’s neck, a beautiful
colour on her cheek, and her lips parted in a gentle
sigh, she certainly looked rather a tempting
burden. Altogether, the “ anniversary ” gather-
ing may be described, in the words of the Mel-
bourne H.T., as “thoroughly unique.”
Our dear old Sydney friend, the Rev.
John Alexander Bowie, gave a lecture the other
evening at the Temperance Hall, Melbourne, ex-
plaining the doctrine of faith healing, and making
statements concerning his own particular prowess.
Which plainly show that tho Melbourne death-rate
is in a fair way to be reduced to a minimum, if not
entirely abolished. On this last head, the ilev. H.
is still a little doubtful; he would be sorry, in-
deed, to assert, he tells us, that he can’t raise
people from tho dead, but he has not successfully
practised on any “stiff ’uns” up to tho present
time. The rev. physician, it appears, is infallible
in cases of “ interior diseases of women, to a most
extraordinary degree,” over 1000 such cases having
been cured during the last fifteen months, the
grateful sighing of several females' among the
audience testifying to the truth of his statement.
John Alexander impressed upon his hearers (who,
by the bye, formed altogether about the most
“job ” lot of humanity over assembled, oven in a
Temperance Hall) the fact that he was actuated
by no desire for worldly gain in the spiritual heal-
ings to which he was devoting himself; nay, more
—that he refused with scorn tho “gold which was
scattered at his feet” by grateful patients, and
then—the plate came round. After the plate had
run its allotted course, the lecturer detailed some
of his most startling cures, commencing by in-
stancing the case of a young woman who had
made a donation to the world of a beau-
tiful babe, only a week before.” and was now
“going on well.” (Hear, hear! and hallelujah! from
tho front benches.) Another cure was that of a Mr,
Sparkes, a gentleman who had for years been the
owner of a “ blind left eye,” owing to a cancer
which persisted in developing itself in the roar of
the unfortunate optic. Mr. Sparkes called upon
Mr. Bowie, and was “ arrested in the Lord,” and, in
“ loss than three minutes ” from the time that Mr.
B. poked his peeper, the cancer ran out into a
handkerchief, and Mr. Sparkes “could read large
print.” (Applause, and more Hallelujahs! which
Mr. Howie, with a deprecatory smile, begged
might be suppressed.) More illustrations of faith
followed, so remarkable in their results that Mr.
H. expressed an opinion that “ people mightalmost
think lie was romancing.” (Hear, hear! from an
insignificant clique of sceptics.) And then, as
“ time ” was about to be called, he wound up with
an attack upon newspapers in general, and the
Spectator in particular, the editor of which
journal is so misguided as to feel doubts upon the
subject of faith-curing. Tho violence of Mr.
Howie’s attack leads people to imagine that, if the
rev. gentleman possessed powers of death-dealing

A Meeting.
With never a word she passed mo by,
With never a look or sign;
She silently went her way, and!
As silently went on mine.
No one could have dreamed, who saw her face.
As we so coldly met,
That her heart was touched by the faintest trace
Of memory or regret.
Nor do I think that one apart.
Who watched thy tranquil brow,
Would have guessed that the memory stirred my
heart.
Of a faithless, broken vow.
But they needn’t have guessed or wondered, you
see.
For this was the reason why—
I didn’t know her, and she didn’t know me,
And so—she passed me by.

It is full, crisp, and clean on the palate; and
whilst it exhtiirates, it unquestionably aids dges

AYER’S '
Hair Vigor
restores, •with the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color, or deep black, as may be desired.
By its use light or red hair may bo darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled; it contains neither oil
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume,
Mr. C. P. Butcher writes from Kirby, O..
July 3, 1882 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
falling out, and in a short time I became
nearly bald. I usd part of a bottle of
Ayer’s Ham Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a now growth. I
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but for the
use of your preparation I should have been
cutirely’bald.”
.7. W. Bowen, proprietor of tho McArthur
(Ohio) Enquirer, says : "Ayer’s Hair Vigor
is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
I speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. Tho Vigor is also
a sure euro for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has tho preparation over failed
to give entire satisfaction."
Mr. Angus Fatiwsatrn, leader of tho
celebrated " Falrbalru Family ” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from lioston, Mass., Feb. (>,
1S80; “ F.ver since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of tho change which fleeting
time procurcth, 1 have used Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness — a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in tho eyes of tho public.”
Mrs. O. A. Prescott, writing from 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
" Two years ago about two-thirds of my hair
came oil'. It thinned Very rapidly, and i was
fast growing bald. On using AVer’s Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regularly used hut one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
Wo have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the must skepti-
cal of i Is value.

“THE BULLETIN” PRIMER—LESSON V.
' r
Now, when the exploration of New
Guinea la commanding so much public attention,
it may bo interesting to know that as early as 1864,
when the late Dr, Lang, by a series of lectures,
evoked considerable Interest throughout tho
colonies in that island and its vast unknown re-
sources, some Queensland pioneers, viz.: Arthur
Blair, John Graham, Walter I. Eden Mackay (the
discoverer of Port Mackay), and Cotgrave (Indian
Navy), wrote to Mr. Herbert, then Colonial Secre-
tary, asking if they succeeded in fitting out an
expedition, and developing the resources of New
Guinea, would the Queensland Government re-
munerate them. To which Mr. Herbert replied,
that while warmly approving of such an object,
he regretted the Government were not prepared
to assist in such an exploration, but recommended
them to apply to Sir Roderick Impey Murchison,
then president of the Royal Geographical Society.
Thus the matter fell through.
“ Watch your flancie as she leaves your arms.”—
Rousseau (slightly altered )._
[Fob The Bulletin.]
It was only yesterday we heard why Jones
had taken to drink. He was to be married on
Monday last, and on Sunday night he spent four
hours gazing on mementoes of his bachelorhood
before destroying them.—
Photos, of barmaids, columbines, grisettes,
Clowns, corner-men, plump, pleasant leading
ladles
(So called because, when we become their pets,
We shoot the rapids on the road to Hades),
With here a heap o’ stereoscopic slides -
Maidens in dress bixarre and pose entrancing,
There a danseuse whose gauze but thinly hides
The limbs she twirls bewltchlngly in dancing.
Pipes of the fragrant cherry wood, whose scent
Perfumed the air at many a glorious revel—
(Alas! that hours so joyously mls-spent
Should load—as preachers tell us—to the devil;
That nights at poker, lansquenet, or trente-
Bt-un, diversified with song and laughter.
But end in muddled minds and bodies bent.
And life should never seem the same life after.)
Copies of “Cavendish” were on the case.
Of Ovid’s “ Art of Love ” (ne’or out of season).
A pamphlet on “ The Way to Win a Race,”
The ‘‘Odes of Horace, 1 ’ Tom Paine’s “Age of
Reas n,”
The “ Book ol Common Prayer,” the “ Sportsman’s
Guide”
(Who does not read the latter is a dull dog),
“ ufce Way to Set a Rat-trap,” side by side
with “ How to Choose a Wife,” or “ Train a Bull-
dog."
The Christmas Bulletin, with “ Ghostly Gold”
(Who has not read it ?) on the well-known cover:
“ I cannot part with this,” he said, and fold-
Ed it upon his breast, like ardent lover
When to his heart he clasps his chire amie.
Or hears her thirteen hoot upon the back-stair
Trying to estimate her L.S.D.—
Guessing the artist’s where she bought her slack-
hair.
Oath’ring them all in one promiscuous mound,
Pipes and tobacco, fairies of the ballet —
Queens who to airs melodious nimbly bound —
Sophy and Stella, Susan, Sis. and Sally,
Horace and Ovid, Ouida, Zola, Paine-
All that the jeunesse doree madly crazes—
He stuff’d into the stove, and when again
H® turned—In one fierce blaze they’d gone to
blazes.
The early sunbeams danced on daisied lea,
Meadows and uplands, hill sides, plains and bel-
lows,
Tipping the crested waves far out at sea,
Darting and diving like a flight of swallows.
He rose: the happy morn at length had come
For him to don the matrimonial halter,
Forswear eoarte, nicotine, and rum,
And pledge his love and fealty at the altar.
Upon his table lay a perfum’d note
(It was not there when he retired to slumber),
He kissed the seal—full well he knew who wrote
“Jones,Esq.,Coogee” (sheleftoutthenumber)—
Then trembled, stagger’d, fell upon the floor:
His fiancee (she begged him not to scorn her)
Had run away from home the night before
With Bill, the one-eyed butcher round the corner.
And now ’tls said he’s taken to the flute,
Toots “ As I view those scenes ” and “ Do not
mingle;”
Her image he’s extracted branch and root,
And swears that through this life he’ll journey
single.
Pond’rlng upon his first love and his last—
Hoping that Bill, when on the “bust,” will
“cook” her—
His days he gives to “ Mem’rles of the past,”
His nights to hazard, billiards, rum, and euchre.
Official letters received at Perth indicate
that Mr. Anthony Hordern, of Sydney, who Is ar-
ranging the Mammoth Land and Railway Scheme
i for West Australia, was much more successful
than Sir Julius Vogel, who started a similar enter-
arise at the same time and for the same colony,
tr. Hordern, being ready to invest his own large
capital, found others in the same way willing; but
with Sir Julius, probably on account of his specu-
lative political history, very little money was
forthcoming. The result is that while Mr. Hor-
dern’s syndicate proceeds with their Beverley-
Albany line, they amalgamate with Sir Julius
Vogel’s company to carry out their York-Eucla
Railway scheme. Private letters state that “Sir
Anthony Hordern ” is on the cards.
While we Australians are devoting our
Ingenuity to solving the perspiring problem of
how to keep cool, other English colonists—in
Canada—are occupied with quite a different task,
the Canuck's lively dread of frost-bite being just
on a par with the Cornstalk’s nervous apprehen-
sion of sun-stroke. The Winter Carnival at Mont-
real commences on the 15th of this month, and the
thought of the beautiful Ice Palace which will be
erected on Dominion Square causes a refreshing
shiver to run through one’s half-baked body. The
Palace is built of about 8000 large blocks of ice,
“mortared” together by snow, the only wood-
work about the structure being In the turrets of
its fine towers; however, the application of tho
“ hose ” to the pine branches which compose these
turrets soon supplies them with the coating of ice
necessary to complete the fairy-like tout ensemble.
With the electric light gleaming through the
crystal walls, the effect at night-time is positively
dazzling, and the American visitors who filled
Montreal during last year’s Carnival week were
loud in the admiration of the unique spectacle.
The whole cost of erecting the Palace and the ad-
jacent ice-huts (where “Johnston’s Fluid Beef”
is dispensed in ten cent drinks) is about £500, less
the price which some enterprising ice-merchant
pays for “the building as it stands,” when the
Carnival is over. A novel item in the week’s pro-
gramme is a two days’ trotting meeting held on
tho St. Lawrence River. A very good mile track
is cut out of the rough surface of the ice, a tem-
Iiorary grand-stand is erected, and a muster of at
east twenty thousand people each day witness the
sport, the temperature out there in the open—for
the river is two miles broad opposite Montreal-
being about 25 degrees below zero. Speaking of
the temperature, it is amusing to see the Yankee
visitors, who have run over in their immaculate
stove-pipe hats, hasten to lay out a few dollars in
fur caps, realising the Inconvenience which would
result from returning home without any ears to
speak of. Another big thing is a torchlight pro-
cession by about a thousand members of the
different snow-shoe clubs, in their picturesque
costumes, who, after “inaugurating” the Ice
Palace, start for a tramp up Mount Royal, at the
back of the city. As the men make their way
along the tortuous track to the top of the moun-
tain, the blazing torches look, from the distance,
like a great fiery serpent wriggling through the
snow, while the rapid descent is oven more strik-
ing. But the standing dish of the Carnival is
toboggannlng. A toboggan mav be roughly de-
scribed as a board in four Joints, about six feet
long and two feet broad, with a curled iron front,
and low cane rails running along the sides. Upon
this, two and even three people take their seats,
packing themselves as closely as possible; and
when all is ready, the “steersman” starts the
toboggan down the steep snow track, throws him-
self on to the end, and with the right leg hanging
behind tries his best to steer a straight cousse
throughout the Journey, using his leg lor a rudder
in much the same way as a fish uses its tail. The
principal toboggan tracks are down the side of a
mountain, and as they soon get worn almost as
smooth as glass, a half-mile spin doesn’t take many
seconds. The chief danger that the voyageurs run
is from collisions through erratic courses being
kept, or being overtaken by a heavier and there-
fore swifter party—in which case some nasty spills
and occasionally broken limbs result. But con-
sidering that at Carnival time as many as two
thousand toboggans run down a track in one day
there are wonderfully few accidents; and given an
expert “ coxcn,” a tramp up the mountain is well
repaid by the exquisite excitement of the almost
breathless journey down again. The majority of
the Canadian girls enter into the sport with en-
thusiasm (though it is needless to mention that a
cavalier does the steering), but strangers in the
country, even of the masculine persuasion, find
some difficulty in screwing up their courage to the
sticking point, and usually prefer to line the sides
of the track and watch what they term the “ fool-
hardiness” of their young friends. The initial
journey is the “ pill ’’—after that, the terrors
quickly disappear; but the sort of bid-good-bye-
to-mother expression which a man usually wears
while “ enjoying ” his first toboggan ride affords
infinite amusement to the onlookers. Rather dif-
ferent, all this, to a Christmas picnic.
VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tropic Love.
When autumn seres the leaves,
And clouds arise,
My spirit ether cleaves,
And southward files,
Fleet-winged as frigate-bird,
O’er trackless seas;
By distance undeterred,
Or baffling breeze.
It wantons o'er those isles,
A glittering chain,
Where tropic beauty smiles.
In Auster’s main.
A reef-girt land its goal.
It hears again
Tho moaning billows roll.
The trade-wind’s strain
Vibrate along the shore,
While rustling palms
Responsive murmurs pour
In ghostly psalms.
There, piping-voiced at eve,
Sun-gilded maids.
In chorus, weirdly grieve,
As darkness shades
Their passion-kindling charms
That lusty Day
Has pressed with burning arms,
Till urged away.
In ocean’s urn, he cools
His molten race;
As pahWjuna rules
ThfflBffir-lIt space.
Yet vivid with his fires,
In shaded bower,
The ardent youth desires
The trysting hour.
That blissful hour, when soft
The queen of night,
In beauty reared aloft,
With pensive light.
Romantic thought inspires.
And wild delights;
Till passion wakes his fires,
And love requites.
Bo, yonder youthful pair
With ardour burn.
In mutual fondness share —
For rapture yearn.
Beneath the smiling moon,
In ambush placed,
They, wildered own the boon
By angels graced;
On silvery wings, arise
To realms above.
And crown, with blissful sighs,
Tho dreams of Love I
How he Died.
We found him dead in the cellar,
With a plok-axe in his hand.
And a look in his eyes, once stellar,
Heroic, and oven grand.
You remember, of course, the story
Of the Roman sentinel,
Who was dug up to gleam in glory
For doing his duty well.
This man, no less than the Roman,
Deserved an immortal name—
t’or, we say It distinctly, no man
Could more have struggled for fame.
He was a bard, and to us
Sent anemic—miles of it—
Which snwvod that he little knew us —
We shoved it.down in the pit.
Down in the pit, deep under
The floor: that pit so dark,
Where the loudest clap of thunder
Sounds like a kitten’s bark.
He came to the office proudly,
His hair behind him streamed.
And he asked for his poem loudly,
And ire in his eyes there gleamed.
We could not his epic, stellar,
Give him back, e’en for love;
But, pointing down to the cellar,
We gave him a gentle shove.
Wo opened the trap-door lately.
Another bard to drown—
Our bards are increasing greatly,
Since kerosene’s gone down.
There is a pile of papers
Down In the poem-pit.
And the burner of midnight tapers
Had Just got his head through it.
teems enough to dethrone one’s
Reason, were burled here—
And he had not found his own ones,
Though he had been there a year.
The Reason.
You know the stylo of men who call
Their lady mothers “ maters,"
Whose shoos you cannot see at all
1'or Nubian and gaiters;
The boys who sport the shortest coats,
And collars wear that cut their throats—
You've seen them bloom,
And heard the talk that, drives you wild
With fury, of each glided child
In some refreshment room.
Well, Hugh de Guy was one of these
Close-buttoned up nonentities,
Just come across the sea.
He’d done the trip— aw—lust for fun;
He had no “coin” but ‘'travelled” on
Rls noble pedigree.
He came to conquer and to crush,
With others of a high-toned “ push,"
And “ give the girls a treat ”;
And lo, behold De Guy, he froze
On to a Hebe—one of those
So rosy and so neat,
That rettllv site.gleams quite a star,
Aloft cate bar.
Amidst the wreck could be discerned
A marble table over-turned,
And, lo, behold a pair
Of brightly-shod be-galtered feet,
Toe-pointed to the celling beat
With feebleness the air.
** The matter ? ”—Oh. she’ll tell It you.
While dancing are her eyes of blue—
In terms that are not devious—
“ We fired the masher out because
It Just occurred to us he was
Considerably too—previous I ”
