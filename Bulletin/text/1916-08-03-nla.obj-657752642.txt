M. H.
Gallipoli
Anzac has discovered a new Australian
author. Sydney de Loghe, author of The
Straits Impregnable (Australian Authors’
Agency, Melb., 3s. 6d.), writes the finest and
most convincing account of that splendid
forlorn hope. lie has needlessly troubled to
tell us that his story is true: it rings abso-
lutely true. It is merely the narrative of
one Australian Billjim from his enlistment
in Melbourne, through the weary time in
Egypt and the strenuous endeavors of
Anzac, to his return, invalided, home. But
the man can not only write; he can see the
things to write about. The early portion
of the book affords his graphic pen small
chance of brilliance: lie gives merely a
faithful report of camp and transport life.
His mates and his officers emerge from his
narrative as real figures; like the author, we
come gradually to know them, filling in the
first crude impression of their personalities
with the qualities that camp and trench
life bring out. Many an Anzac will recog-
nise himself, with usually a surprised plea-
sure, under another name. But it is his
own personality that pleases most; for this
“galloper” to the Staff of the Field Artil-
lery Brigade is a man of The keenest artistic
sympathies, a brave fighter and an Anzac
that can growl and swear with the worst—
that is, the best —of them. And the strange
community of Anzac becomes to the reader
as familiar as the suburb he lives in.
This “galloper” did all his galloping for
the Colonel on foot. His duty was to
attend that energetic officer on his many
dangerous walks abroad, to take messages
through shelled areas, to set forth on diffi-
cult quests in the darkness; and his pleasure
apparently was to see everything that was
to be seen, at no matter what risks to
himself. His pictures of Anzac demand
more quotation than this page can afford.
One would like, for instance, to quote his
account of his shaving himself in a hot
corner while waiting orders. Or the pic-
ture of the shirkers that in the general con-
fusion of the landing remained behind in
comfort, filling themselves with jam and
bully beef... .or the officer, who had lost
his way and his men and everything else,
including his nerve, and who started to cry.
But here is a casualty, absolutely
stamped upon the retina: “The soldiers
pushed themselves against the walls, and
the procession went by. The dead man
came last. 'I peered from my funkhole and
looked him in the face. I do not think he
was quite dead ; but I heard someone say in
a stage whisper his back was broken. His
face was yellow, and his mouth a little open.
Death had not stamped him with nobility.”
And the story of Sam, told in his epitaph
“I looked into Sam’s face and an ole
thought came back to me. Death is not
often beautiful. Here was no heroic end
here was no bold gaze, which told of past
duties well done. Nothing of that kind,
nothing. But, instead, a silly smile where
the mouth dropped, and a little blood on the
palate, and a skin turning yellow and blue.
Not heroic, my friends; not beautiful!....
Friend Sam, you were rather a ‘rotter’—
weak and easy to lead. Life owed you more
years; but they would have been years
without profit. Now you have died at the
start of life, and others following will
remember your sacrifice and take heart.
You could have done no better thing.”
And here is the cook, who, to the author’s
wonder, found spirit to go on with his job.
“He talked to nobody, and I wondered what
ho thought about down there. Maybe he
cooked to forget hie miseries. He cooked
and he kept shut his mouth, which was all
asked of him. A fellow can grow into a
hero by shutting his mouth on a remorseless
campaign of this kind.” And as the cam-
paign went on: “Grumbling was rife, and
I have heard men pray for a bullet to end
them, and there were mysterious accidents
of a bullet through the hand or the foot, yet
all the time there was heart in us And
everywhere was conviction of final victory.
....A half-hearted argument went forward.
“‘I joined fer the six bob of course:
what else’d a bloke do it ferV’
“ ‘I joined ’cos I ’ad a row with the old
woman. I went out in a ’urry and joined
right away, and I blasted well wish I
’adn’t.’
“ ‘What did you join fer, Darkie? Was
it the six bob, or a row’ with yer tart, or
was the police after yerV’ Darkie made no
answer. ‘Wot was it, Darkie?’
“‘I joined ’cos I thought a bloke ought
ter join.’
"It was like the bursting of an 8.25 shell.
Nobody said anything. Nobody moved at
all. I looked around for a museum to put
the sentiment in.”
The author’s picture of the strange scene
when the armistice was declared to allow
the combatants to bury their dead is a
remarkably vivid piece of descriptive work.
Some of de Loghe’s detail is sickening: “At
one place was a crater in the ground where
a shell had burst; and round it, like
chickens come to feed at a basin, lay eight
dead men. It was the prettiest bit of
shooting that you might wish to see.” These
were Turks. But near A battery were four
of “our fellows.” “They were of those who
had fallen in the first rush, and had been
overlooked. Their clothes were little
stained, for no rains had touched them, and
their hats were still cocked to one side in
the jauntiest manner. The first man was a
skeleton, picked as clean as a century of
waiting could do The next man waited
on his back, too; but the fierce sun had
done otherwise with him.... Face and
hands were tiny, the face and hands of a
child they were: yet the face was full of
expression, and more terrible to look on
than the face, of any ape ” This page
must pass the third and the fourth man,
else, like the author, the reader would have
“to turn away and spit.” “And those four
men had been filled with great foolish hopes
but a few weeks before.”
So the dreadful weeks marched on.
“There was no savor in the food; the water
ration could not quench the thirst; there
was no new scene on which to feed the eye;
there was no change of duty. We were no
step nearer the end of affairs. And typhus
and dysentery began to stalk abroad. A
man had but to keep his mouth shut to
prove his heroism.” And men were killed
and their epitaph told in a few curt words,
like this:
“Little Billy Blake meets me in the
valley one midday. ‘Have you heard about
poor Bill Eaves?’ he says. ‘What’s up?’
say I. ‘Dead,’ he says. ‘Damned sorry to
hear that,’ say I. ‘How did it happen?’
‘Don’t know. They found him at the top
of the valley. A shrapnel bullet had copped
him in the top of the napper... .1 helped
to take him down to the beach. ’Strufh, I.
was sweating at the end!’ ‘Bad luck fox-
old Bill,’ say I. ‘Blasted bad luck,’ says
he. ‘So long/ say I. ‘So long,’ says he.”
Here is a little brief portrait that will be
recognised, that of “Captain Cari-ot, the
war correspondent. I took him about the
trenches more than once. He was rather
tall, and rather thin, with a peaky face and
glasses. He carried a camera in place of
a rifle. In Egypt he had written an article
which had much offended the army; and
many were the threats against him. But
someone told me, in a charge down Cape
Helles way, he had exposed himself to get
a good view, and so he was forgiven. I
don’t know how true is the story; but his
popularity came back. He had little to say
to me.”
Had Captain “Carrot” known that
Gunner “Lake” was himself writing history,
and with a graphic touch that even “Carrot”
might envy, one fancies that the two might
have had much to say to each other.
There is one portrait that is painted with
a loving care, that of the Colonel whose gal-
loper the author was. In the end we get to
love that Colonel, as Gunner Lake grew to
love him. Listen to him: “Says the other
man, ‘You had a gun blown out yesterday,
didn’t you?’ ‘I think it can be fixed up,’
says the Colonel. ‘Three men went with it.’
And then he wags his head with very great
sadness. ‘You can get new guns; but you
can’t send down to Hell for new gunners.’
And you love him as he sits and stares at
the forbidden Edeh of Achi Baba, covered
with the sleepy sunshine. ‘Look at it, look
at it,’ he would mutter. ‘What a place for
love and fishing!’ ” And again: “Did you
see what Hamilton said in brigade orders —
‘the incompai-able Twenty-ninth.’ That
rather blows us out, doesn’t it? You can’t
easily beat ‘incompai-able.’ I suppose when
a general hasn’t had his name in the paper
for a few days he starts writing ‘incom-
parable’ and ‘glorious’ and ‘magnificent’
before his troops • and then the people at
home say, ‘Those men have been thx-ough a
hard time. That general must be a hell of
a clever fellow.’ ” So there seems truth in
the author’s remark, “I think he had a sneak-
ing liking for me, as I had for him.”
No book has given yet so graphic or so
convincing an account of that forlorn endea-
vor at the Straits; none has been Written
with so human a touch; none has succeeded
so wonderfully' in conveying the atmosphere
of Anzac;. none has hitherto drawn the
figui-e of Billjim life-size, mercifully omitting
the halo.
&
Lt.-Col. J. H. Patterson, D. 5.0., author
of that grim true thriller, The Man-Eaters
of Tsavo, figured in a remarkable rQle in
Gallipoli, as the commander of the first Jew-
ish unit that has fought in the wars of the
world since the days of the Maccabees, over
2000 years ago. In the revised version of
the Old Testament, therefore, Patterson is
entitled to figure as a captain of a host of a
Children of Israel. These Israelites wei-e
refugees from Jerusalem, of Russian nation-
ality but of Jewish faith, who fled from the
Turks to Suez, and there patriotically desii-ed
to bog in, after their 2000 years’ vacation,
on behalf of their faith. Accordingly the
Bx-itish authorities allowed them to volunteer
for a purely Zionist force, known as the
Zion Mule Corps; and the presence of
Patterson in Egypt decided the Comma nder-
in-Chief to give him the command. Patter-
son knew nothing about mules except that
they were the devil; but he eagex-Jy seized
this. chance to do his little bit. And so suc-
cessful was Patterson with his mules that he
did not lose one from sickness all the time
he was in Gallipoli—though there was one
that he vainly did his utmost to lose. Appar-
ently mules are built that way.
Jt
With the Zionists in Gallipoli (Hutchin-
son) is Patterson’s delightful record of that
unique experience-—a book that would delight
the heart of his G. 0., Judas Maccabseus.
Patterson is outspoken in his opinions of
things and the British staff-officer. He has
the reader’s assent when he dissects the
faults in strategy that made for us those
Straits impregnable. “The key to the Narrows
is that portion of the Gallipoli Peninsula
which extends across from Anzac, through
the heights of Sari Bair, to the Dardanelles.
If, therefore, instead of dividing the force
(which unfortunately was the plan adopted),
and having it held up or destroyed in detail
the whole force had been thrown in its en-
tirety at this point and a vigorous sledge-
hammer blow delivered, I feel absolutely con-
fident that a crowning victory would have
been gained, and the expedition would have
been a glorious success. Of the four Turkish
armies the only one that could have opposed
a sudden vigorous thrust at the key position
was the one at and near Anzac, and this
force we could have swept aside and crumpled
up before any of the others could possibly
have come to its assistance. That the Ex-
peditionary Force could have landed here is
proved by the fact that the two Australian
and Maoriland Divisions did land here, and
these dauntless men, by themselves, almost
succeeded in taking Sari Bair and getting
astride the Peninsula. For eight months
they held their end up, and more than held
it up, against overwhelming odds. Had
they been backed up at the time of the first
landing by the ‘incomparable 29th Division,’
one of the best the British Army has ever
seen, together with the two French Divisions,
with their hundred celebrated .75 guns, and
the Royal Naval Division, no Turkish troops
at that time in the neighborhood could for a
moment have stood up against them, and
with our grip once established on the Penin-
sula nothing could have shaken us off—not all
the soldiers in the Ottoman Empire.
“Every Turk on the southern portion of
Gallipoli must inevitably have fallen into our
hands within a few days, for it was well
known that they were but ill supplied with
ammunition and food.” He points out that
there was no chance of escape for these, and
that no help could reach them from Con-
stantinople. “Once astride the Peninsula,
where our length of front would be less than
seven miles, with over six men to the yard
holding it, nothing could have shaken off our
strangling hold. It would only then have
been a question of directing the fire of the
heavy naval guns on the forts in the Nar-
rows, by direct observation, and these strong-
holds would have been pounded to dust by the
battleships within a week, thus leaving open
the road to Constantinople. Such might have
been the glorious ending of the Gallipoli
campaign if only sound strategical and tacti-
cal methods had been employed... .Of course,
it is easy to be wise after the event, but I
never did see, and never could see, the point
of dividing our force and landing on the
southern part of Gallipoli.”
At Lemnos, while energetically remedying
another of these Staff bungles, Patterson was
approached by Captain Edmonds, in charge
of the medical stores for the Australasians,
who had been ordered to get on board a cer-
tain transport in the harbor but had been
provided with no means to do so. And, as
far as Edmonds knew, his were the only
hospital stores available for the Austral-
asians ; and the transports were sailing for
the landing on the morrow! Patterson put
aside his own worries to help Australia out.
Writing from Anzac subsequently, Edmonds
stated that Patterson had averted an appall-
ing calamity from a medical point of view,
as he did not know what Anzac would have
done without his stores the first two days.
In the course of his strenuous and good-
humored narrative, the author mentions that
on one occasion his Israelitish mules saved
the Bi’itish from defeat. The mules broke
loose under shrapnel and behaved so mulishly
that the approaching Turks took them for
charging cavalry, and poured a volley into
them, thus giving away their position. . He
also lets us into the secret of our painful
lack of ammunition. “Our guns never had
ammunition enough to prepare the way
properly by a devastating bombardment.
Trench warfare seemed to have taken us
completely by surprise; we were without
trench mortars, but luckily were, able to
borrow some from the French; neither had
we any bombs or hand-grenades, except such
as we could manufacture locally out of jam
tins! No battery commander was allowed
to fire a single round unless he had first
obtained permission from his brigadier, and
even when a couple of battalions of Turkish
troops well within range could be observed
marching in column, the brigadier was com-
pelled to limit the battery to two rounds only,
for to such dire straits were we reduced
owing to lack of ammunition!”
Patterson thinks highly of his mules, and
of many of his muleteers, but his highest
tVn^LS- res ™} f or the Anzacs. “They

pvpnhioenthusiastically concludes, “When we

War
The difference between Patrick Macgill
and -the other authors at the Front is merely
a difference of rank. The other writers,
merely tell us about the private; Macgill is
a private. The Red Horizon (Jenkins) is,
therefore, a dinkum human document. The
author of Children of the Dead End writes
of war, which is chiefly navvying, with the
outlook of a navvy—an inspired navvy. And
the whole of the private’s philosophy is that
the war started because it had to be: it
just came—like a war-baby.” And the pri-
vate does not mind confessing that: “I have
been thrilled with fear three times since I
came out here, fear that made me sick and
cold. I have the healthy man’s dislike of
death. I have no particular desire to be
struck by a shell or a bullet... .1 am more
or less afraid of them, but they do not strike
terror into me.” The three thrills of Patrick
Macgill were: (1) “A yell, a piercing, agon-
ising scream, something uncanny and terri-
ble”; (2) “a groan as if a child were in
pain, then a gurgle as if someone was being
strangled, and afterwards a number of short,
weak, infantile cries that slowly died away
into silence”; (3) “three cries in the dark
... .somebody screamed ‘Oh! Oh! Oh!’ the
first loud and piercing, the others weaker
and lower.” This was the only thrill that
he could identify. “I heard that a boy had
been shot through the belly.”
This is not a book of heroics. It is
hardly • necessary for Macgill to tell us that
he has come to the conclusion that war is a
dull game: his book tells us that. But there
are commonplace horrors enough. Here is
one of the usual incidents of the war, the
removal of a wounded man to the reat:—
“His head was uncovered, and it wobbled
from side to side, a streak of blood ran down
his face and formed into clots on the ear and
chin. There was something uncannily help-
less in the soldier, his shaking head, his
boots caked brown with mud, the heels
close together, the toes pointing upwards
and outwards and swaying a little. The
bearers walked slowly, carefully, stepping
over every shell-hole and stone on the road.
The sweat rolled down, their faces and arms.
.... Suddenly they came to a pause, lowered
the stretcher to the ground, and two of them
bent over the prostrate form. I could see
them feel the soldier’s pulse, open his tunic
and listen for the beating of the man’s heart;
when they raised the stretcher again there
was something cruelly careless in the action,
they brought it up with a jolt and set off
hurriedly, stumbling over shell-hole and
boulder. There was no doubt the man was
dead now; it was unwise to delay on the
road, and the soldiers’ cemetery was in the
village.”
There is humor, too. War would send
every man to the madhouse if he did not
have a saving sense of humor. In a com-
munication trench, packed with supports,
under heavy_ shell-fire all night, Bill could
say: “If I kick the bucket don’t put a cross
with ‘ ’E died for ’is King and Country’ over
me. A bully-beef tin at my ’ead will do, and
on it scrawled in chalk, ‘’E died doin’
fatigues on an empty stomach.’ ” This at a
time when: “The sang-froid which carried
us through many a tight corner with credit
utterly deserted us, we were washed-out
things; with noses to the cold earth, like
rats in a trap we waited for the next moment
which might land us in eternity.” And the
war, as far as one private has seen it, is
waged for the most part with big guns and
picks and shovels. “The history of the war
is a history of sandbags and shells.”
Sandbags and shells, mixed with horrors.
One of a covering party for the Engineers, re-
pairing the barbed-wire defences at night,
sprang to his feet suddenly in the full
light of a German star-shell. He had a
reason.
“ ‘Well, bli’my, that’s a go,’ he said, cough-
ing and spitting. ‘What ’ave I done, splunk
on a dead ’un I flopped, a stinking corpse.
’E was ’uggin’ me, kissin’ me. Oh, nark the
game, ole stiff ’un,’ said Bill, addressing the
ground where I could perceive a bundle of
dark clothes, striped with red and deep in
the grass. ‘Talk about rotten eggs burstin’
on your jor; they’re not in it.’ ”

Edison has really developed a new art in music—and it can be heard only

Anna Case was the first artist to prove that the New Edison does re-create

“I Felt Extremely Weak
and Gould Scarcely Walk.”
“9 Was Laid Up in a Hospital.”
“But am now Completely Restored, and my Sleep is
Rendered Most Refreshing.” The Wonders of Clements Tonic!
THERE are many Business Men in Sydney to-day who feel the effect of the
great heat, the strenuous times caused by the War, and the worry of business
to such a degree that they are more dead than alive when the day closes—
almost too fatigued to reach home. To those men the letter published below by
a prominent city accountant appeals, for it tells in a few words how jaded nerve
strength can be restored, insomnia banished, and health regained bv the use of
this well-recognised remedy, Clements Tonic. It is the medicine that decreases
weakness and increases strength. It should be in all houses in these oppressive
days. No house is medically equipped without it. Read this letter: —

“After suffering and being ill in hospital for about 12,
months, I met a friend of mine (a chemist), and, feeling
extremely weak and scarcely able to walk properly, 1 asked
him what I should take tb bring some vigor into my system.
“He strongly advised Clements Tonic, and, not to be
sceptical about it, I took his advice and have since thanked
him most heartily. That was about six weeks ago, and I can
most I ”ruth full y say that the Tonic HAS CREATED WONDERS.
“My constitution is almost completely restored. From
restless nights 1 can now sleep soundly, awakening in the
morning thoroughly refreshed. My appetite, which was very
jaded, has returned, and I thoroughly enjoy every meal I take.
“You can make use of what I have written, as it is a
man’s duty to advise his fellow beings what benefit he derives
from a medicine that will do universal good. I really feel

A Great REMEDY for
BLADDER TROUBLE.
Drinking water that is of bad quality or
too soft often causes bladder trouble. Every
sufferer tortured with the agonising burning
pains of bladder inflammation (cystitis)
should try a harmless remedy which gives
relief in ninety-nine cases out of every hun-
dred in a way that can only be described as
miraculous.
This torture and pain is caused through
germs iii the bladder. De Witt’s Kidney

yet marvellously 7 soothing antiseptic, which

penetrates the diseased tissues, attacks and
destroys the germs, makes the urine after a
time bright and clean, bringing a wonderful
quick sense of relief and ease.
If you are troubled with rheumatism,
gout gravel, backache, tired feeling, dropsy,
. right s disease, constipation, cloudy urine,
inflammation of the bladder, or other
symptoms of urinary trouble you should
give this wonderful remedy a trial imme-
diately , Decause it brings quick relief, almost
eveiy time- guaranteed—and a sure cure
follows in most cases.
To cure rheumatism or any other form
o . t kidney trouble you must positively get
nd of the cause—the poisonous uric acid.
Kemember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. when you see the urine change
to a muddy bluish color—a feature which
distinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
LUls from all others—you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing touch
?? ri ght spot—the kidneys and the
bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to the
kidneys—that is why De Witt’s Pills give
such amazingly quick relief—every time.
A permanent cure follows in almost every
case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don't waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.

have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by

heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in

must wind up your system, in order that, purified
and vitalized, it shall run smoothly all day long,

The Little Men.
Ob, it rained when the moon was a scimitar
bright,
And it rained when the moon was a queen;
Then the Little Men rose at the dead o’
the night,
And they painted the winter world green.
Such a wonderful green in the path of the
rills-
On the road, by the river—was seen,
And it spread o’er the paddocks away to the
hills
An incredible carpet of vreen.
Though the sky was a smudge of pale ochre
and grey,
And the air as a razor was keen,
And the trees stood ashamed in their naked
array,
Faith, the ground was a glory of green!
Oh, the Little Men gather their paint-pots,
I think,
In odd corners where no one has been ;
An you’ll give them rain-water in plenty to
drink,
They will paint you the universe green !

Legends.
Oh, Life is a teller of tales and she comes in
slyly,
Most roguishly eyed with her instep raised
for the pace:
&he worries no jot if you value her lowly or
highly,
For what can you know of her soul who hut
see her face?
One thought her a maiden full ripe for a
gentleman’s wooing,
And lie came with a bouquet behind him and
mentioned her hair;
But she told him she wouldn’t be cook to his
constable’s cooing,
And slapped his face till he died, and she
did not care.
One thought her a pleasure dame and
accosted her lightly.
He diced and carded and roystered and felt
for her breast,
And he asked her about her garters and,
getting too sprightly,
He floated under the bridge for his merry
jest.
One thought her a shrewish matron, and
shrank and quivered.
He heard her voice with a tear and a coward
sniff.
He called her an ogre, a witch from a hell-
wife delivered.
Mitli a girlish giggle she hunted him over
the cliff.
*
Still Life's not a lady I’m anxious to marry
or cuddle,
And she’s not a bit keen about sofas and
moonlight walks;
But I make her a lire in my room that's a
hell of a muddle,
And we draw our chairs together and then
she talks.
Her soul buccaneering in space for the gold
dream plunder
She blandly ballads of marvel and stratagem,
O*. vague soul movement she croons in her
baby wonder.
Oh, Life is a teller of stories of star-love and
thunder,
And I am immortal because I have listened
to them.

The Mask.
The laugh woke sorrow in my soul,
Though why, I could not say :
Her fingers touched a flower-set bowl,
r Her voice seemed light and gay ;
Yet, as a light point touched, a while,
Her features with its tip,
The tragedy behind the smile
Mocked laughter on her lip.
I wonder. . . .Life is but a masque
„ Where things least felt are shown;
Each face is set the bitter task,
To shield and hide its own ;
To cover up some haunting thought
That cankers all the while,
Till out of misery is wrought
That curtain of a smile.
She is a stranger still to me ;
I do not know her name;
And yet because she suffers ill
And smiles, and plays the game,
Her picture for a little space
t Across my memory slips.
Where tragedy upon her face
Mocked laughter on her lips.

KEEPING THE FENCES IN REPAIR.
The X-rays of war, produced by the cross-
flashes of the opposing cannon, have done a
lot to reveal the make and shape of the
world’s soul. In the smooth days before
machine-made widows were turned out by
the munition factories in wholesale quan-
tities it seemed that nationality—the hiving
off of sections of humanity into separate
political units —was a feeble thing, gradually
losing its grip upon the imaginations of men
and destined to fade away into something
universal in its scope. Citizenship of the
world seemed to many minds a bigger thing
than citizenship of England, France or Aus-
tralia ; and many went farther and asserted
that the nation was only the savage tribe a
trifle extended, and that the spirit of nation-
alism was mere parochialism with thought
boundaries broadened an inch or two to suit
a modern fashion. All the war evidence
goes to show that these so-called wider views
are opposed to the world’s thought; that
nationalism is a reality, rooted deep in the
soil and the heart; and that there is nothing
on the planet which counts quite so much.
This may be due to the fact that humanity
is shortsighted, or that the worship of the
dividing fence has become a superstition;
but the chances are that it is really based
on clarity of vision and something inherent
in geography and human nature. In any
case, in a world of doubtful theories and
lame practice, nationalism appears to be a
plain fact which it is foolish to avoid or
ignore.' It makes the biggest call upon indi-
vidual enthusiasm; and as enthusiasm is the
motive power which keeps things moving,
progress and nationalism appear to be linked
together for ages yet to come.
* * * *
Viewing the world as a farm which
Adam’s children as a punishment for original
sin are compelled to cultivate in the sweat of
their brow, nationalism appears not merely
sentimental but falls into place as possessing
a sound economic value. At one time the
universal pasture was one big commonage
where the individual owners of stock tailed
their herds from day to day and fought with
zeal and clubs for the right of their mutton
or beef to chew the best grass. It was a
wasteful plan, and the introduction of divid-
ing fences, even though it entailed bitter
quarrels over the boundary lines, was a dis-
tinct advantage. Thus parcelled out, the
country could carry more stock and the
separate owners could work their holdings
to better advantage. Then came the day
of agriculture and closer settlement, with
its further subdivisions made necessary _ by
the demands of intensive culture. Nation-
alism is really a system of fencing, and the
pride or enthusiasm of the farmer in his own
acres is exactly paralleled by the pride or
enthusiasm of the nation in its own political
estate. The world-farm, too, presents features
which make its national subdivision the more
important; for it is a tangled piece of
country requiring a lot of clearing and
grubbing in places and a lot of drainage
and fertilising in others. One paddock is
right for wheat-growing ; another is fit only
for pasture; a third is choked with stink-
wort and blackberries. It is essential that
these portions should be kept apart. Again,
other sections of the ground are infested
with rabbits, and only the best sort of
wire-netted fence can protect the better
lands from their inroads. In some cases
the boundary lines have been set up with
little skill at the will of conquering armies
or political princes; but these are not really
national frontiers at all. In most cases
the real borders are plainly recognised by
the people living along them; and the
stout fence of public opinion exists even
when some politically blind potentate has
decreed that the official line of demarcation
is somewhere else. The people know the
rabbits and the swamp and the stinkwort,
even when the overlord’s agricultural in-
capacity would leave the wheat open to be
trodden down by military bulls and polluted
by political ground vermin. The salvation
of the world lies in putting the fences in
the right places and clearing the paddocks
one at a time until they are brought to the
highest pitch of human productivity.
Nationalism is partly racial and largely
geographical. Some of the soundest nations
are of mixed race to a point, though the
kinship of the races thus blent would seem
to be necessary to real amalgamation. Thus
German and Slav in Bohemia blend uncer-
tainly, while Celt and Latin in other lands
fuse easily and harmoniously. But the
geographical and the racial ideas run close
together. It may or may not be true that
there is kinship in thought among those
who of choice settle in a certain country;
but there can be no doubt that the country
largely shapes the race which inhabits it.
Unless there are fundamental racial differ-
ences, such as those between nigger and
Red Indian, the mere fact that two peoples
eat the product of the same soil for a
thousand years must bring them close
together in type; the mere fact that they
look out for generations upon the same
mountains or plains or rubbish heaps must
make them alike in thought. Only in such
a way can the keen, living nationalism of
a newly-constituted State like Belgium be
accounted for, or the fierce strivings of an
ancient Slav State like Poland to be free
from the general Slav rule be explained.
A thousand forces go to create national
boundaries. Some are instinctive, some
geographical, some religious—belonging not
so much to outward religious forms as to
subtle religious” varieties of outlook —some
lingual, some connected with custom and
habit; but. all summed up, they amount to
a very solid thing indeed, more real in the
great world-scheme than a triple line of
fortified trenches or a row of 15-inch cannon.
Australia, with a natural sea-fence, a dis-
tinctive pattern of land formation, carrying
flora and fauna unlike those of the rest of
the world, and a set of climatic conditions
varying tremendously from north to south,
but having about them a sort of conformity
in variation, is essentially the home of one
nation. Although the continent is in a sense
a world in itself, capable of producing all the
needs of a high civilisation, it has no natural
dividing line. The very boundaries of the
States, with their arbitrary rectangles, laugh
out of court the suggestion of any real cleav-
age. Small State spites parties still exist in
corners of importing warehouses and belated
associations of reactionaries, but in the sum
of things they count for less than the dust of
a windy August morning. No genuine Aus-
tralian can think of Australia divided or
imagine a break in the continental unity.
Where the bigger danger lies is in thinking
lightly of the tremendous force and power of
such nationality as may be here developed.
From the advantages of our geographical posi-
tion we have opportunities such as no other
people can possess ; but those advantages can
be dissipated and those opportunities lost by
setting our march to the wrong tune. The
easy talk of empire, the flag-flapping in the
name of patriotism and the interests of
foreign trade, the ignoring of the things near
at hand while indulging in large talk about
things vague and distant —all this is inimical
to nationalism and the growth of the Aus-
tralian spirit. The world advances a nation
at a time: and there is no good reason why
Australia should not be in the very forefront
of that advance. The essential thing for
every Australian is that he should regard
Australia as his job. Holding to that, our
nationalism can become a real thing, and
the clatter of London and New York and
Calcutta need not worry us more than the
wail of a dowager-peeress for the return of
W. M. Hughes to Britain.
THE RISK OF BEING ASSAULTED
FOR DEFENDING THE GOVERN-
MENT’S POLICY.
Australia is at war. The Australian
army—or part of it, anyhow—is writhing
in one of the most tremendous struggles ever
waged. And while our men are dying and
the issues at stake swing in the balance,
public meetings called to support the public
policy of the country in respect to the method
of repairing the wastage of war are being
smashed up. Irate mobs of Australian
citizens and soldiers are chasing supporters
of the Australian national policy to cover.
Police have to intervene to prevent the advo-
cates of Pearce’s voluntary system from
getting a punch on the nose. This paper
does not know whether there is another
country in the world where anyone who tries
to defend the military policy of his Govern-
ment has to be rescued by the local .T. Hop.
If there is, the fact is being kept dark. But
in Australia it is so. Anti-conscriptionists
are unable to get a hearing at public meet-
ings. Yet the Federal Ministry is an anti-
conscriptionist Ministry—or has been pre-
tending to be, which is the same thing.
Isn’t it about time the Government recog-
nised that these demonstrations are some
sort of reflection upon itself'?
Australia can send Billjim all sorts of
things, from socks and plum puddings to
congratulatory telegrams and copies of the.
newspapers containing somebody’s most
recent patriotic address. And Billjim will
be very thankful. But the thing lie wants
more than anything else to help him in the
terrific job he is working at is a further
supply of Billjim. He doesn’t want to be
addressed in the trenches by wandering poli-
ticians who assure him that his deeds of
valor are achieving imperishable glory.
What he does want is to be told that his
mates are coming on behind. This paper
suggests that this is what Australia ought to
be telling the lads in France and Flanders.
It is almost hideous to think that there
should be another day’s delay in making
clear to them that they will be given the
backing of the nation’s full strength. And
it is most certainly damnable that the public
should have no effective weapon at hand to
stir these alleged leaders of theirs into a
sense of their obligations to the , men who
are already at the Front. All along the
system Australia has been working on has
been grotesque. It is a system unjust from
every point of view. But, worse than all, it
is one which only the blind could ever have
pretended to believe would adequately meet
the needs of such a frightful hour as the
War God struck two years ago. Now,
partly because our leaders have so miserably
failed, thousands of negroes have been
brought into the fight—for Australia!
Thousands of Chinese have been landed in
France for war work—for Australia!
* * * *
The truth about it all is that ever since
the war broke out Australia has been living-
in a fool’s paradise, and those who would
have told the truth have not been permitted
to do it. Two years have been spent nurs-
ing delusions. Instead of organising the
nation’s full military strength, so that it
might achieve the maximum, squalid poli-
tical considerations have been allowed to
intervene and check the patriotic instincts
of the people. The community has been
encouraged to go on vaguely “hoping for
the best” and entertaining the fatuous
notion that by cursing Berlin and yelping at
Potsdam the German could be hurled back
behind, the Rhine. And this merely because
a few loud-voiced individuals were bawling
fantastic ideas of citizenship, while another
collection of “military” and other geniuses
had a mania for handing out soothing syrup.
But the people can’t be fooled all the time.
What Australia is going to wake up to
industrially and commercially there is too
little reason to doubt. What Australia has
already awakened to is a knowledge that
BilljtM'. who is fighting with a splendid
courage to repel the nation’s enemies, is
getting more verbal support than physical
assistance from his Fourteen Houses of
Parliament. And this, combined with the
further knowledge, which the events of
every day strengthen, that the fight will
still be long and desperate, is beginning to
hurt. Therefore has it come to pass that
the doctrine of the anti-fight-for-Australia
people (which stripped of all its blither
boils down to this: that Australia must not
send Billjim all the help she could) is
greeted with the loud bray of public deri-
sion. And people who want to defend the
voluntarist policy pursued by the Federal
Government have to demand a police body-
guard while they do it. This may indicate
that voluntaryism lias become more wildly
popular than ever, and that the Federal
Government’s policy represents the wish of
the people. There is just a chance, how-
ever, that it indicates nothing of the kind,
but is the public's only way of saying that
it has grown sick of seeing this most im-
portant business paltered with.
KARL (NOT WILHELM) LIEB-
KNECHT.
Everyone knows the name Liebknecht,
though nobody can pronounce it except the
Germans. They rarely need to use it.
because they have little use at home for its
owner. But the Australian seems always
in need of it when he wants to talk about
German Social Democrats—those famous
“Socialists” who are said now. once a week,
to be rioting in Berlin and cursing the
Kaiser. It happens that the Germans are
right, for Liebknecht (Karl, not Wil-
helm) is about as important in Germany as
an Anti-Conscription orator in Australia.
The Australian is right, too, for Karl is a
good specimen of German Social Democracy
of the sentimental and chattering kind. He
is a feminine man —loves a good cry, and can
beat Bottom at condoling in some measure.
1 le never has been a leader among men-
Socialists in his own country (the virile
brutes are too strong for him), and he is
not now leading the much-advertised
“minority” that has seceded from the Social
Democratic party. The leadership is held
by the much-greater villain Haase. But
Liebknecht, before foreigners, has been the
better spruiker. and has done good service
as buttoner and confidence man. That is
why he is so well known among people who
never seem to have heard of Haase.
* * *
He is a traitor to humanity, who began
by being sincere. The explanation starts
from the patriotic, wise and courageous con-
duct of his father Wilhelm, who refused to
approve or even be silent about the annexa-
tion of Alsace and Lorraine after the war
of IS7O-1. For the noise of protest he and
some others made then. Wilhelm had to do
a couple of years in gaol. His name there-
fore became holy among the French, some
few Germans and not a few’ English. And
his son Karl loves and has been living on its
prestige. The poor, hysterical creature even
now can’t imagine a more impressive form of
assertion or denial about his own miserable
conduct in the test of this war than the one
he used to the indignant Belgian Inter-
national Socialist leaders when they accused
him of treason to the common cause, and he
“invoked the name of his father.” It was
his habit with foreigners, and was then his
only hope, for his own name was Mud.
Now he has carried his ancestor-worship to
the length of getting himself gaoled, just
like Wilhelm, for opposition to the war-
policy of his country. But only innocent
and remote foreigners, like editors of Aus-
tralian daily papers, are beguiled. The
French are ironic when they mention him
at all. The Dutch don’t mention him, but
fly at the much-bigger game of Haase and
Scheidemann and half a dozen more. For
us, though, Ltebknecht (“Love’s knight”
would be the English for it) is still Love’s
martyred holy knight. Yet he voted in the
Reichstag for the first war credit, which was
passed after the Chancellor Hollweg had
announced that Belgium’s neutrality was to
be, and at that moment probably had already
been, violated. The Chancellor himself
admitted the wrong. But Liebknecht
neither protested nor refused to vote
for the credit. That was the time to go
to gaol. But he wasn’t taking any just then.
“A quick and lively campaign” (ein frisch
und froehlicher Krieg ) was the motto of the
hour; and how nearly true it was ! Every-
body in the know in Germany believed in it,
and the Social Democrats were in the know.
So Karl held up his hand for the squelching
of Belgium on the quickest and liveliest road
to Paris. lie had been among the speakers
at the Anti-War meetings, alleged now to
have been arranged by the Social Democrats
at the request of the German Government
as a blind to make the French and Belgian
Socialists believe that their German “Inter-
national” brethren would not allow war.
And then he voted, as the party voted to a
man, in favor of war, i.e., in favor of the
murder and robbery of the Belgians and the
French who had honored his father’s
memory and had given him their affection
and respect because he talked like his father.
* * * #
When Belgium had been over-run,
Liebkneciit had the assurance to go to
Brussels and interview the Belgian repre-
sentatives at the “International” head-
quarters. He was “coolly” received and
ugly words like “treason” were used to him.
But he was “profoundly moved” by some of
the gruesome sights he was shown. Did he
go back and get gaoled then for what he
said of the doings in Belgium? Not a bit
of it! The war was still going “quick and
lively.” In a month or two it might be
over. But the battle of the _ Marne came
instead. And the rush to Calais got a nasty
knock, and things began to get very dear
in Germany; the harvest wasn’t good and
food had to be rationed. Then Liebknecht
got the jumps and uttered a few screams.
These plaintive outcries were not stopped
by the censorship. They were good for
foreigners to hear. The more it was sup-
posed that German Socialists were going
back on the war policy, the less fear there
would be of conscription in Britain —and
Australia. Finally in December Lieb-
knecht actually voted against the new war
credit. It was quite safe to do that
then. Partly for that reason the Dutch
Socialists ignore him; but they are
very rude about Haase, who has
led the “Internationals.” They say that it
w T as Haase who arranged the sham anti-
war demonstrations before the war and
that he is now playing the same game in
another form. They tell him to go to Hell
with the other murderers, whether Kaisers
or Social Democrats. They refuse to be
“Internationals” with him and his crowd
any more, no matter how much the German
International Socialist may squeak and
gibber at the Government for which he has
fought and plundered and burnt and
harried and raped and mutilated in Bel-
gium, France, Poland and Servia.
That is the answer to Ltebknecht, too.
The war has taught us what he and his
“Internationalism” are worth. It is known
that his colleague Suedekttm was an emis-
sary to Italy and Roumania to try to keep
those countries out of the war by Socialist
influence; also that Koster and Noske had
the same commission in Belgium, and
Liebkneciit’s own tears and invocations
there were to the same effect as the more
masculine reasonings of these others. The
attempt now to “split the party” and get its
astute old lawyer-chairman Haase into con-
trol of the supposed repentant faction
bears every appearance of being another
national plot. There was a time
when that other harbinger of destruction,
the Marxian .Toeckh, could proudly
announce “The German proletariat is the
spiritual centre of the International.” Dur-
ing that time the spring at the throat of
Europe was being plotted and prepared for.
It has failed, and as Muenstekberg. an
emissary of the professor class, has told the
harmless Americans, it has got to be pre-
pared for and made all over again. Of
course the most valuable means of the
“International” must be saved from the
present ruin, and Haase is the man to do
it Liebknecht, too, sanctified by suffer-
ing, can be useful later on —unless the
Socialists of all the nations do as the Dutch
have done and sweep them, an indistinguish-
able mass, with the Kaiser, the Crown
Prince. Hollweg, Tirpitz and all the other
assassins, into the nearest sewer. But they
should continue to honor Wilhelm (not
Karl) Liebknecht.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
His Honor Higgins Turns Sour on
Collective Bargaining.
When Justice lliggins gave his “all a
matter of contract” judgment in Sydney a
few weeks ago —thb point of it being that
an award rate of wages was merely the
foundation for bargaining, and that, if men
refused to accept it and knocked off work
the incident could not be called a strike—
it looked as if he had said more than he
intended, fie also discovered in a few days


that his observations were being given a
very free interpretation by unionists. But-
since then bis Honor has repeated himself,
and at Melbourne last week he went a little
further and damned the uniform wage.
Speaking on a matter relating to the eternal
rumpus at Broken Hill he said :
It was a very grave matter indeed to dictate to
members of unions that they should bind themselves
not to ask for more than the minimum, wage,. There
had been a strenuous attempt of late trying to bind
.unions and members of unions to that deadly system
of one uniform wage, where a man was given no
hope of bettering his condition by additional effort
and skill. There were some cases in which, possibly,
it was the duty of the Court to prescribe the maxi-
mum wage, but those cases must be carefully guarded.
He wanted, as far as he could, to see that men
who asked for the minimum wage should get it as
the wage below which their employer must not pay
them, and not be bound to accept that wage unless
they chose.
Of course it is nonsense to say that anyone
has attempted to “dictate to members of
unions not to ask for more than a minimum
wage.” If there has been any dictating in
the matter it is the unions themselves that
have done it. Collective bargaining has
led to the presentation of united claims, not
for minimum wages, but for the wages to
which members of unions considered them-
selves entitled. It is these claims that have
gone to the court with the sanction of the
claimant unions, and rates have been fixed
not on the basis of a minimum wage, but
by a rule-of-thumb adjustment of the general
wage that should be paid by a particular
industry. No doubt has ever existed that
the fixed wage which gives Smith, the first-
rate workman, the same as Jones, the
second-rater, is open to objection. But that
is not what Smith and Jones are grumb-
ling about even if Justice Higgins is. In-
deed it is one of the things the Arbitra-
tion Act contemplated giving encouragement
to To bring arbitration to a point at
which there would be collective bargaining
in respect to minimum payments, while
allowing individual huckstering for a bit
more, might conceivably be workable; but
where the difference would be between that
and scrapping the whole thing takes some
finding. _ Certainly, it would upend a lot of
trade-union theories and seriously under-
mine the sense of brotherhood entertained
by .Tones for Smith. And incidentally it
would remove almost every practical reason
there is for the existence of an Arbitration
Court.

Defence Schemes or Defence—Which
Do We Want?
According to Defence Minister Pearce,
“Australia must commence now to inaugu-
rate some system of being prepared.” But
Pearce’s notion of being prepared is not
exactly one to fill Australia with confidence.
The main suggestion is of a permanent Coun-
cil, consisting of politicians and representa-
tives of the naval and military forces, to
undertake the task of observing “indus-
trial and commercial developments, taking
note of railways and communications, col-
lecting data and watching other matters of
detail.” There is no mention at all of the
creation of a real citizen army to include all
adult Australians, no word at all of keep-
ing faith in the matter of the construction
of the one vital military railway,
no. thought about bringing the existing
railways to a standard gauge which
would render them of military value
in time of need; no reference, in fact,
to any of the big things that urgently want
doing. In place of these Pearce proposes
his Defence Council, not to do things, but to
take notes. The inference is that the whole
alleged scheme of preparation is chiefly a
dodge for creating military jobs. Unfortu-
nately such jobs are the easiest of all to
create because of the military power to sup-
press criticism and the very decent desire of
the average citizen not to kick up a disturb-
ance in a matter which may be vital to the
missus and the kids. Outside danger, when
all press reference to it is denied, may loom
large or small in the public estimation, but
it can always be made to look big enough to
hide in its shadow some swanking and
utterly useless persons who draw unearned
screws from the public purse. If Pearce
had wanted to pose as the public friend of
the gilded job-hunter, he could not have put
his Defence proposals in a manner more cal-
culated to display the fact; and his reference
to the way in which they did things in Ger-
many suggests that there are a number of
people still clinging hard to his official ear
and whispering any nonsense that happens
to be handy. He declares that Germany
caused “a revolution in military matters by
adopting a thinking centre for its army, the
great general staff.” But actually where
Germany scored was in having all her men
trained and properly armed, and in having
practical systems of railway to carry them
to the points where they were needed. That,
notwithstanding all this, the German general
staff, with its 40 years of preparation and
its ready armies and munition supplies,
couldn’t carry its plans through seems a
pretty poor argument in favor of following-
in its footsteps. Our Defence hitherto has
been a makebelieve. We have spent years of
time and hundreds of thousands of pounds in
elaborating “systems.” In just the same
way we formerly spent generations in argu-
ing about Federation and holding conven-
tions and drafting schemes. Then the people
got sick and tired, and somebody said that
the only way to Federate was to Federate.
In the same manner, the way to defend our-
selves is to do it. and not bother about creat-
ing more boards and councils to pose and
talk and draw fees.

A Short Way with the Man Who Won’t.
At the Broken Hill Trades Hall the other
Sunday evening a number of people gathered
and took a solemn pledge that whatever
might happen they would not serve Aus-
tralia. The oath of non-allegiance, which
was unanimously adopted, runs this way:—
I, , being fully convinced that the conscrip-
tion of life or labor in Australia will be a death-blow
to organised labor, and will result iii the workers of
this land being crushed into subjection by a capital-
ist military oligarchy, do hereby pledge myself to
the working class of Australia that I will not serve
as a conscript, industrial or military, and that
1 will resist by every means in my power any
attempt to compel me or any of my comrades in
this organisation to break this pledge, even though it
may mean my imprisonment or death, and I take this
pledge voluntarily or freely, knowing that if I break
it I will be branded as a traitor to my class.
After that there is no more to be said. The
man who has signed such a document is
beyond argument; and to prove to him that
his claptrap, about subjection to a capitalist
military oligarchy is wrong is not worth
while. He has deliberately placed a curse
upon himself —the curse of being branded as
a traitor to his mol) —if he takes up his first
duty of citizenship by bearing arms in
defence of his home at the bidding of his
fellow-citizens. He is prepared to shelter
behind the protection afforded him by the
real Australians who are prepared to serve
their country to the death, and he is willing
to enjoy the benefits of Australian institu-
tions and the advantages of high Australian
wages. In return for these privileges he
vows to be a shirker when the real call to
his manhood comes. Under the circum-
stances. the only sane attitude of the Com-
monwealth towards him is quite clear. He
should not be forced to serve as either a
military or an industrial conscript; neither
should he be sent to prison or be put to death
or persuaded to become, a traitor to his mob.
Australia has no place for unwilling servants
of useless punishments. The man who has
signed the pledge against serving the country
should simply be put out of the country.

Asking About the Dardanelles.
THE Commissions set up in England to in-
quire into the conduct of the Dardanelles
and Mesopotamia campaigns look like
attempts to reconstruct milk after Straw-
berry has knocked over the bucket. The plain
facts, which are known to everybody, will not
be altered if years are spent in taking evi-
dence and digging up the bones of the blun-
ders. Those facts may be briefly summar-
ised as follows: (1) A British Cabinet of.
kindly-intentionfd old gentlemen, who were
accustomed to conduct the affairs of the
nation as a Missionary Board attends to the
conversion of the heathen, found itself up
against WAR. War was an animal it had
never seen and of whose existence it had
entertained religious doubts. (2) A British
army, excellent in its way, but so small as
to be a jest in international circles, found
itself up against WAR. War was a crea-
ture whose little brother it had met in India,
Africa and elsewhere, but which when full
grown proved utterly beyond all its expecta-
tions, imaginings and dreams. (3) A
British Cabinet and a British army, face to
face with WAR and discovering that they
knew nothing whatever about it, started to
experiment. They did this by throwing little
armies at the animal from different angles
to see if it could catch them in its claws. It
caught them all right. (4) A new army was
created on an enormous scale, and the ex-
periments were continued. The new, big
army began to tear up WAR instead of
being torn up by it. This is all that any
Commission can find out about things. Some-
body blundered —everybody blundered. How
in the circumstances could they do anything
but blunder?
Fritz’s Tragic Example in Oil.
“Greaser" on an Australian problem-:—•
The Financier set out recently to analyse the com-
mercial and financial position of Fritz, as partly
betrayed by the Budget in the Reichstag last March.
It is clearly understood that the Allies intend by
their blockade to send Fritz broke and to stop the
wheels of his machinery from running round, which
may be a more feasible proposition than to blow him
off the face of the earth at Pozieres and elsewhere.
It is discovered, or alleged by the investigator just
mentioned, that among all raw materials Fritz stands
most in need of oils and fats of all descriptions.
“Tlic shortage of lubricating oil,” so the tale goes,
“is becoming so serious that the services of trains
on certain lines have had to be suspended.” Side-
issue as it, might have seemed when the war began,
Fritz may, in a way, cease to carry soldiers to the
Front because of lack of axle-grease for the train-
wheels.
On the opposite side, Britain and the Allies feel
so badly about oil that one justification put forward
for the blundering tragedy in Mesopotamia is that it
preserved our possession of Persian oil-fields.
We in Australia have a 'vast amount of assorted
fat to spare, but in the matter of mineral oil we
have gone to sleep in the knowledge that from our
own resources we have not a day’s supply for our-
selves. As regards kerosene the Australian populace
has been rabidly Freetrade; on the plea that it was
“the workingman’s light” there has been a steady
refusal to pay for home development. Old Bill
Lyne narrowly escaped being pole-axed when he
fought for oil duties. The allied commodity of petrol
is an interesting one; it provides Royal Commissions
and criminal prosecutions and no-confidence motions,
and these sorrows would not fall upon us if we
supplied our own grease. But for the Too-Proud
country and .Tax the Dutchman and Burmah and
Borneo we should go unlit, unmotored and unlubri-
cated. Any nest of enemy submarines in the Pacific
could leave Australia shrieking on every axle for
lack of oil inside a month.
Through continual reluctance to divorce ourselves
from old barren Freetrade, we can’t do a thing on
our own. An Australian army-could peer at Pozieres
through a periscope for ever but for the big guns
and shells we know nothing about; and we have
just been told that when the men come home from
the war in bits their wooden legs will be “made in
U.S.A.”
Fritz’s tragic example, now that he dies slow
and hard in his beleaguered home, hits Australian
attention every moment. We have made only the
smallest beginning of self-reliance, and Oil is one of
the lessons we should learn. There is oil in N. S.
Wales, possibly in Bananaland, the Territory and
South Aus., certainly in the Speck, and perhaps a
lot of it in Papua; but Australia has only fooled
with the question of its production. Are we not
going to learn wisdom from the agonies of Fritz 9
Brief for the Defendant.
“Gordon G.” delivers it :
Incessant guff against lawyers makes me tired and
angry. The Beast has good points. With great re-
spect, your Honor!
He gathers in much less spoil than is generally
imagined. On an official list of 12 groups of tax-
payers he is eighth down. A shark’s chief charac-
teristic is a full belly. On his belly the lawyer is
no shark.
Costs, Esq., is the only gentleman engaged in the
pursuit of money whose charges are regulated by
scales which fix a maximum. Wages Boards for all
other forms of robbery fix a minimum.
“The Law is an Ass.” But only because somebody said
so. Our system of Law is the carefully-evolved work of
the best brains of centuries, and the Gentleman One
who toils under the system is in the mass a brainier
man than the majority of his fellows. Chicanery,
cunning, lying, deceit —-these and similar words rend
the atmosphere when the average bloke talks about
him. Yet lawyers are now, more than ever before,
sought after in connection with things that matter.
Of course they are trusted. Isn’t your own lawyer
trusted as much as any man of your acquaintance?
Are not our Judges trusted more than any body of
men in the land? Were they not lawyers once?
The political world holds more lawyers than any
other set of men. By electing them the people show
their trust and confidence in them. And when
elected they almost invariably rise above their
fellows.
They are absolutely lacking in esprit de corps
during business hours. Their chief delight copsists
in trapping each other and making one another look
cheap and dirty. Consider what an inestimable boon
this is to a hardly-done-by client. It means that
the man he is paying fights the case with all the
ardor and zeal which personal interest inspires.
Taxing Masters, Judges and other court officials do
the rest —thoroughly. Contrast the damnable cam-
eraderie which exists almost everywhere in the
medical profesli.
Finally, lawyers’ charges are frequently the cheap-
est things on earth at the price. For a carefully-
considered will, with years of legal training brought
to bear on it (one of the most eventful bits of busi-
ness in a client’s life), one or "possibly two guineas.
The price of apples is nothing to it. For the
defendant brute in a maintenance case who through
the agency of a subtle legal point escapes an eter-
nal 7s. 6d. per week-—again, one or possibly two
guineas. Surely, that's not excessive.

From Papua
The Commonwealth Government wrote to Papua
that it would be a graceful thing if the Possession
remitted the Customs duty on tobacco entering from
Australia. Papua, in reply, said that something
might be arranged, and suggested that the Com-
monwealth might admit duty free (or rebate part of
the duty on) Papuan coffee and Papuan peanuts—
specifically, that Papua should be put on the
same footing as the New Hebrides. The Common-
wealth reply was illuminative—the Government
said nothing, and keeps on saying nothing. Eight
or nine years ago Papuan coffee used to bring £6O
per ton in the parchment and £9O stripped. Then
the Commonwealth raised a tariff against the product
of its own territory. To-day not a trace of the
plantations is left, except a few bushes running wild
in the jungle. This is how the Commonwealth dis-
sembles its love for its only child. There is not a
country in the world better suited for coffee-growing
than Papua, and no crop that suits the small man—•
who makes new countries—more. We hear it said
that the Commonwealth cannot expect to keep the
North unless it uses the North. That applies equally
to Papua. The Commonwealth can only keep the
Possession in its own hands by making' use of it.

A noteworthy testimonial to the merits of
an Australian wood was lately made public
by the Vic. Institute of Architects. At a
time when Tasmanian hardwood was pur-
chasable in this country for Ids. 6d. per
300 ft., the identical article was bringing
235. on the Pacific Slope, though that coun-
try's own Oregon could be got there for 3ls.
<>d. The record will stand as a proof from
outside of the local article's virtue, if any
outside proof were needed. The chief reason
why Oregon is used in this country in pre-
ference to our own hardwoods is just that
the Australian jerry-contractor can’t be
relied on to put in seasoned timber. So
the average architect says oregon and saves
trouble. Anybody can tell oregon from
bluegum : but it takes an expert to differen-
tiate between seasoned and unseasoned
hardwood. A scheme, which is being pushed
by the Institute of Architects, for the
branding of seasoned local timbers, should
alter ail that. Rut the alteration would
be swifter and surer if the State Govern-
ments took the responsibility.
♦
The business of inventing new restrictions
and tying up the citizen of the Common-
wealth in more complicated knots of red
tape appears to grow as the excuse provided
for it diminishes. When there really were
some Germans about who might pass infor-
mation of our doings along to Wilhelm
a good deal of liberty of speech was granted
all round and people could come and go
pretty much as they liked. As the enemy
menace disappeared and his ships were
sunk or chased off the sea, the official hand
came down more and more heavily on press
and public ; and now, when the Kaiser is in
a fair way to be beaten and all the infor-
mation which might come to him from Aus-
tralia couldn’t avail him tuppence in his
grim retreat before the Allies, absolute
silence and complete immobility are looked
upon by those in authority as necessary for
our salvation. The latest order is that no
woman may enter or leave the Common-
wealth without a passport. The same
Government which, apparently for political
reasons, fails to bring in compulsory service
for men. prevents the free movement of
women as if there were some intention of
conscripting female labor for war purposes.
It may be very amusing thus to issue
meaningless orders in an arbitrary fashion,
and the writing out of passports may pro-
vide work for some tired person in search
of light employment at good wages; but
the folly cannot go on for ever. Pearce’s
censorship and red-tape tying have made
themselves ridiculous by their extravagance,
and they may kill the Ministry that sanc-
tioned them before all is over.

“Dyer” : There are shirkers, idlers and
wasters on both sides of the pay-desk, and
they will never be cured of their meanness
by the ordinary appeal 6f patriotism. My
boss employs approximately 26 hands —12
males and 14 females. Before the war he
had 14 males, but eight of them, all Aus-
tralians. have left to. join the colors. The
six new hands who were taken on to fill up
are immigrants between the ages of 18 and
40, and are all Unmarried. The boss’s two
sons (one is 20 and the other 23)
don’t do a hand’s turn about the factory,
but they are “patriotic”: they run their
old man’s motor do*wn to the wharf when a
shipload of wounded soldiers comes in, and
whirl the invalids to the hospital. They
are also very busy on Button and other
days. There was a vacancy in the dye-
house lately, and about 20 turned up to
interview first me and then the boss. I
picked out five who were eligible, three of
them returned soldiers and two married
men who had a knowledge of the work. But
the boss finally reviewed the whole batch
himself and took on a newly-arrived immi-
grant of about 20. because (apparently) he
was willing to do the work at 355. a week,
whereas his predecessor got £2 ss. Which is
another proof that in fighting against con-
scription or universal service the Political
Labor crowd is fighting for the natural
blacklegs of the community.
“Denny Mooney”: During my short stay
with the Terrible Turk we were supplied
with two kinds of bully beef, one English-
tinned, the other Canadian—one so salt
as to be almost uneatable; the other with
no salt at all and about as tasty as a wet
sponge. I remember seeing only one case of
Australian beef, and I was trampled in the
stampede for it,. But I was lucky enough
to secure a, tin. and it was Meat. Brand,
C.Q.M.E. Co. Again, jam. Never a sight
of a bit of Australian-made. Only English
brands with contents so thin that it was
impossible to keep the stuff on a biscuit.
(I used to drink mine.) As there are
several brands of meat and jam tinned
in Australia, and good stuff at that,- and
the boys were continually demanding them.
I and several other Bill.tims are curious
enough to ask why they didn’t get them.
♦
“Mujik” : Why is it that public control
is so deliberately prejudiced by the Federal
Government? The Post Office is the one
great monopoly of the Commonwealth; and
it has more influence than 275 speeches by
Joe Cook in making the public distrust con-
trol by Government Enterprise. Not only
is it exasperatingly inefficient, but it is
notoriously wasteful, and if anyone can be
found to deny that it treats the public with
casual insolence P.M.G. Webster ought to
produce him. In the meantime it would
be a fair thing of Webster to put notices
up in his premises explaining whether the
citizen who wants to buy a stamp or get
an answer to a question or pay for his tele-
phone should consider himself a mere
nuisance, or a black beetle or what. At
present most of him feels like a homicide.
A New Use for the North.
“McNobxh” from the top of the map:
Northern Australia is the most remarkable tropical
country in the world, inasmuch as, while possessing
fertiie soils, sufficient rainfalls and healthy climate
it is. (save for the few whites) inhabited onlv bv the
scarce roving aborigines, and agriculture is' a thing
almost without existence. What the visitor with even
the most superficial acquaintance with tropical coun-
tries notices most is the absence of cocoa nut-palms
along the coast. If Australia had been peopled with
agriculturists such as the South Sea Islanders, our
far-northern littoral would have been fringed with
waving, rustling trees. Instead of which the coun-
try retained the virgin state in which Nature left it
because its aboriginal inhabitants were nomads
whose simple wants never rose above that which lay
to hand. Binghi’s spear, his dog and his women
were, in that order, his main considerations, and he
would walk over thousands of acres of the richest of
country without giving a thought to anything but the
bees’ nests or yams he could obtain from it.
That the North will grow the nuts is beyond doubt.
Wherever the palms have, been planted they have
shown enormous productiveness. Within a few miles
of where this is being written—which is about as
far north as one can get in Australia —are palms
that bear over 100 nuts oath per annum. They are
not freaks either, nor have they received any cultiva-
tion. In Ceylon, a recognised cocoa nut-growing coun-
try, 50 to 60 nuts per tree is considered a very fail-
average. The consistency and regularity of the
seasons is mainly responsible for this great activity
in Northern Australia. And the oil-content is high.
Several samples of Queensland copra (the dried kernel
of the nut) were sent last year to London for com-
parison and analysis. The results were highly favor-
able. The Queensland stuff was described by the
London people as “good sun-dried copra” equal to
that produced in any part of the world.
Consider, too, the rise in the price of copra. Less
than a decade ago £l4 per ton was a good price.
To-day it is over £40 —and still rising. The multi-
plicity of uses to which the products of the cocoanut
are being put is responsible for this enormous rise.
It has been calculated by one of those people who go
in for that sort of thing that four-fifths of the popu-
lation of the world use products of the cocoanut in
some form every day of their lives. So it may be
taken for granted that the high prices are here to
stay, and that they are caused by something more
substantial than hot-air or market-rigging.
In view of the high price and the suitable condi-
tions, why have no serious efforts been made to con-
vert this valuable waste land into groves of wealth-
producing palms? The answer is to be found in the
working of the Land Acts. In Queensland, for in-
stance, it is laid down that the frontage shall not
exceed two-thirds of the depth. So the would-be
cocoanut-plaliter who wants only the narrow strip
fronting on the sea, as the only land suited to his
purpose, has to burden himself with a lot of bat k
country he has no use for. A Bullktin par. a year
or two ago drew attention to this fact, and quoted
an instance of a selector being compelled to take
up 960 acres of land when he only wanted 220 acres
along the foreshore, in order to conform with the
regulation as to frontage. In the Northern Territory
leases for agricultural purposes are only granted for
a term of 21 years. As a cocoanut plantation is
just in its prime at 21 years, and continues to bear
for 50 or 60 years, the short lease-term throttles the
industry at the outset.
Since the alleged attempts to settle the unin-
habited North have proved ghastly failures, it behoves
us to seriously consider any sound, sensible proposi-
tion that promises success, and if infinite.encourage-
ment can be given by merely adjusting a regulation
or two, so much the better. The cultivation of cocoa-
nuts offers a highly-probable means of settling the
far northern coast of Australia with our own people,
and national security demands that everything should
be done which may further that end.

A Week of War.
A WEEK ago BiLUIM was rushing with his
bayonet at Pozieres, which at that time was
full of Brandenburger and machine gun and
sudden death. This week we don’t know
where he is exactly; but the ■ last heard
was that the Brandenburger and the
machine gun had been shifted. Billjim
had got there. But he had to go through
Ilell first, and in the tour he carried himself
with the fine, resolute courage he had shown
against the Turk. Since then Hades has
been raging all round the rim of the curve
shoved bv the Allies into the German posi-
tion. It‘is said that the losses of the Aus-
tralians —in their first leap towards
Pozieres, at any rate —were “comparatively
light.” Everyone at this end will hope that this
was so. And not only then, but in the more
desperate work which followed —when Bill-
jim, after getting foothold in the German
trenches, moved on to the grim work of
clearing the village streets and houses ahead
of him. But while we wait it will
be wise to remember that the Austra-
lians have been engaged in the greatest
battle fought on the North-western Front
since the war began. How necessary the
struggle was we have had further proof this
week. The official murder of a British sea-
captain, on the pretext that he had
attempted to ram a German submarine
which was trying to sink him, and the raid
upon Lille for women and girls, both show
the savagery of the people who had. proposed
to put us under subjection. While great
possibilities swing in the balance between
the Ancre and the Somme, the Bear is
driving his claws deeper into the enemy in
the East. Ilis reported captures from day
to day look almost incredible. But even if
allowance be made for mistakes in the
drafting yards, there is no room for doubt,
taking the map as a guide, that the Bear has
given the Austrian and some of the Germans
a hiding. Of current happenings this is the
most cheerful of all. But the renewed whis-
perings about peace must not be taken
seriously. The time for even preliminary
discussion will not have come within. sight
until a much more substantial military
ascendancy over the enemy has been estab-
lished.
♦ ——
Any idea that the Hun might not be a savage
or had repented of his hunnishness, got a
severe shock the other day when news came
of a British shipmaster having been court-
martialled and shot for attempting to ram a
German submarine. This was an act of
murder even more revolting than if the unfor-
tunate man had been blown up by a German
torpedo. Captain Fryatt’s offending seems
to have been that on some occasion he either
sent to the bottom, or attempted to send there,
a submarine, that was trying to hand him
some Frightfulness. These craft have been
lurking about murdering sailors and sinking
ships wholesale, outraging every decent rule
of war. The only way for a merchantman
to escape was to run away from the assailant
or run into him —and because Fryatt did one
of these things, he was “tried” and shot. Of
course justice would demand that the people
responsible for this crime should be flayed.
But, as in the case of Nurse Cavell’s mur-
derers, the likelihood of anything so appro-
priate happening is mighty remote. So the
incident is merely a sharp reminder of
the kind of animal the Allies are trying to
muzzle and of what is going to happen if we
don’t succeed.
William Hughes came back from his wan-
derings on Monday, and with his feet again
on Australian soil at Perth spoke to the Aus-
tralian people. And the pith and marrow of
what he had to say was this :
In this great struggle all had manifested those
basic qualities of courage and endurance which had
made the race what it was-—(applause)—-which had
enabled them to carve destiny so deeply in the his-
tory of the world —(applause)—so that neither time
nor altered circumstances could ever obliterate it.
(Loud cheers.) They all loved liberty—(applause)—
and would maintain it wherever they were, and go
on and get more. (Applause.) When he thought of
the great things upon which all agreed, and com-
pared them with the few things on which they dis-
agreed, he was perfectly certain they would keep a
united front to the foe, and gather their energies
together, so they might, with the help of God, over-
whelm him. (Loud applause.)
Which of course is exactly what Australia
was waiting- to hear from Hughes. Now
for the rest: What is he going to DO?
Frank Wilson, who became Premier of
W.A. for the second time the other day, is
personally one of the most unliked of poli-
ticians. The Laborists would crucify him
because he is alleged to have said at some
time or other that six bob a day is enough
for a laborer, and many of his Liberal fol-
lowers distrust him, perhaps because he is
astuter than themselves. He is not a par-
ticularly brilliant man, hut he has character,
courage and a touch of audacity; also, he
runs his department, and never permits it to
run him. Only one smart saying stands to his
credit. “The human race,” he once
remarked, “is divided into two classes —-
those who are capitalists and those Who
would be if they could.”

“The Superior Race,” by E. H. Oliphant,
produced at Melbourne Playhouse last Satur-
day, is the sort of Australian play which
any earnest and simple disciple of G. B.
Shaw might have written in any other coun-
try where English language and < social
dogmas prevail. All the people in the
story are presumably supposed to be English
with the exception of a half-Chinese girl, and
they meet in the outer office and mana-
ger’s room of a weird place of business,
where they discuss questions of love, seduc-
tion and marriage in a fairly-entertaining
spirit. Most of the time they sit down to
talk, but in the last act they stand up.
Standing or sitting, they have only the
same three subjects of discussion —love,
impropriety and marriage: matters that
make the world go round, but are rarely the
excuse for family corroborees in city offices
during business hours. It reminds one of
the accidental gathering at Roebuck Rams-
den’s house in “Man and Superman,” when
conversation turns on the delicate question of
Violet and her forthcoming baby.
■* * * *
Author Oliphant seems laudably desirous
of shocking the stodgy outside public into
an intelligent interest in literary drama, and
“The Superior Race” is a very creditable
first attempt. A decent young man admits
to his chum that he doesn’t want to marry
the girl because their joint indiscretion has
been found out. He reckons that he was
more sinned against than sinning. The
woman tempted him and he did go into her
cabin aboard ship. All the same he is
rushed into offering to marry her when her
family unanimously agrees that matrimony
under the circs, is right, oroper, unavoidable
and morally beautiful. The family, however,
violently objects to the girl’s brother marry-
ing a talented and altogether admirable
Chinese half-caste; therefore the young per-
son states that she. also has been “wronged”
and ought to be righted. But the family
refuses to think that sauce for the whole-
caste should be sauce for the half-caste. After

his resolve to defy the family pride of race,
and 'it is then the girl’s turn to state that
she never did misconduct herself and is no
longer desirous of marrying Arthur and
bequeathing a yellow streak to a white
man’s offspring. She is a nice girl, and she
forgives everybody except Arthur’s hard,
respectable mother, who flops on the floor
as the curtain falls.
A saucy conversational prologue, Avell
spoken I ,v a cheeky boy in knickers and a
sweater, and a speech delivered after the
performance—these indicated that the author
had taken himself and his “problem” play
rather too seriously. Thei'e is nothing newly
and originally wicked in “The Superior
Race” ; nothing educational or soul-stirring.
It is just a dialogue comedy in the after-Shaw
manner, more reasonable than a Shaw comedy
for the most part, but a lot less witty and
ingenious. There are many bright lines
in the dialogue, and as many transparent
absurdities in the action of the piece. An
incidental uncle, a giddy old profligate who
proposes to be as bad as a husband to the
heroine, after she has accused herselt ot
indiscretions that never happened, is at once
the most pungent and the least necessary ot
12 characters. The co., with Gregan
McMahon and Mrs. Fowler in small charac-
ter parts, was well fitted all round. As
long as everybody w y as sitting down nobody s
amateurishness was perceptible. On the
whole a fairly capable performance ot a
fairly capable play. It will be repeated on
Saturday for the thirdly and lastly.
At Melbourne Princess’s last week “Aida”
took its place in the Gonsalez repertoire and
the biggest spectacular effects of the season
were scored. In this black-and-tan Verdian
opera, which comes about two-thirds of the
musical way between “Ernani” and “Otello,
there is wide scope for “production.” The
result must have astonished a lot of people
who remembered the tawdry anachronisms
of “La Traviata” in the first week of the
season. Scenery, dressing and fixings are
comparatively magnificent at the Egyptian
Court and thereabouts, and the dozen nimble
girleens (who had previously danced in
“Faust”) were a joy to see. “Aida” gives
the brazen section of the orchestra a chance.
What with the brasses below, and the band,
the chorus, the glow of color and the raging
principals on the stage, the climax of the
second act was an exciting experience.
Some of the principals, however, are over-
taxed. Miss Russ looks and acts the part
of the King’s daughter more impressively
than she can sing it. Mrs. De Revers, with
her persistent tremolo, is only acceptable in
the name part on account of her artistic
earnestness; Cacialli, the melodious basso,
is a tame High Priest, and the other basso
(Mosca) is a tall King whose foggy utter-
ances come from the back of his throat.
On the other hand Filippini (billed as
Scamuzzi) makes a capital captive monarch
from Ethiopia, and the voice of Dagradi,
though quite unequal to the charming aria
“Celeste Aida” in the opening scene, has
enough music and force for the tenor’s
declamatory efforts later on. Dagradi, in
fact, was unexpectedly satisfactory at the
noisiest moments. This week “Carmen”
will be played three nights, including Satur-
day ; and next week “Butterfly” and
“Boheme” come along.

In “Sweet Nell of Old Drury” Nellie
Stewart used to go off to Whitehall in a
sedan chair to mark the period and make the
play look old. In the revived “Belle of i\ew
York,” now putting in a week at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, the hilarious Harry Bron-
son gets himself wheeled to his bedroom on
a safety bicycle, to show that he is part of
the latest stage frivolity ! It is almost piti-
ful —this struggle of Yesterday to mas-
querade as To-day. In the resurrec-
tion Ethel Cadman is the Belle, and,
though right enough in the subdued
blue and red of the slumming Salvation
lassie, she lacks the speed and dash necessary
to lead a female brass band in style. Phil
Smith sub-edits himself successfully as the
Polite Lunatic; but Leslie Holland gives the
impression that even he is not particularly
interested in his own performance of the elder
Bronson. Percy Clifton strides as Kenneth
Muggs in place of the late Lissant, owner
of the part; and Minnie Love delivers most
of the candy. as Fifi. Young Nellie Payne
makes a charming Mamie Clancy. “The
Geisha” flirts her faded fan on Saturday.
Note from Tiie Bulletin’s Censor: —
Editor. — Sir,---There is no objection to your say-
ing that the. Strollers, at the Palace,. Sydney, are a
most dangerous show, taking large quantities of
money which might otherwise go into the war-loan.

Sydney Royal, where the film ghosts have
been walking of late, will have a real flesh-
and-blood show on Saturday, when the Bert
Bailey Co. begins a season with “Duncan
McClure and the Poor Parson,” a compound
laugh in four acts by Steele Rudd.

At bis new surgery at Sydney Criterion,
Hale Hamilton, M.D., is building up a
fashionable practice. The demonstrations of
his new jealousy serum are attracting con-
siderable public attention ; though a lot of
the rush to be treated can be explained by
the fact that the cure is administered by
the medico’s nice new nurse, Myrtle
Tanneliill.
The Merryvale Pop artists must have been
warmed by their reception, in spite of the
Arctic atmosphere of Sydney Town Hall, on
Saturday evening. Miss Gladys Bourke’s
throat emerged from a gladsome apple-green
frock to trill, like some shy bird in the
Spring, of kisses and golden valleys; and
Philip was Newbury at his best. The pro-
gramme was arranged just right.

Lyric: “The Game of Liberty,” illustrating how
easily the C.I.D. can be fooled. But it is just as
well to let somebody else do it.
Empress: The Army Veterinary Corps on active
service, an interesting official war picture ; and lhe
Littlest Magdalene,” a Nooyark slum drama.
Sydney Adelphi ‘‘Follies of Pleasure”
flow over into a second edition on Saturday,
when a couple more burlesques (“Lost in
a Harem” and “Fun on the Beach”) will be
presented by Murray J. Simons. Several .
new vaudeville turns Will also be dovetailed
into the frivolous show.
The company promoters are still tracking
to Sydney Tivoli to see how magician Horace
Goldin does it. The de ..stration takes
up a section of the programme about as long
as the Russian front, and, when it is all
over, the man in the stalls knows as much
about it as he does of the eastern campaign
after reading 37 war books and 982 news*
paper columns. A solemn Red Indian gent,
called Os-ko-mon has called in to have a few
words with the Tivoli congregation. _ His
feathered vestments are fine, but there is no
humor in his medicine. When he takes the
side trail and his campfire smokes no mote,
the audience remembers merely that he had
two hyphens in his name and that the last
section of it sounded Scotch. Lloyd Mack
and Mabelle, who are cheerful on both sides
of the footlights, scored a win last week-end
at their first flutter.

“Peg o’ My Heart” is only in the first
lap of a long run at Melbourne King’s. The
wild Irish girl will continue to sharpen her
wit on her cold, stony English relatives
until further notice. Meanwhile she will
illustrate in her deportment the truth of the
painful proverb that lovely woman is the
creature of her dressmaker. For, whereas
Peg is a smart and graceful Margaret in
the frock her aunt bought for her, she re-
sumes her original lop-sided slouch when
she gets back into her old American coat
and skirt and nurses her dismal dawg once
again.
At Her Majesty’s (Melb.) the ancient
comedy of “Pink Dominoes” is still being
rejuvenated in the musical form of “To-
night’s the Night,” which is managerially
alleged to make “three happy hours for
everybody but the wowser.” The wowser,
apparently, is an unyielding connoisseur who
gazes thoughtfully at the show and bursts
into tears.
The picturesque crinoline drama at Mel-
bourne Royal is due to disappear after Fri-
day. On Saturday they will stage a frank
and fearless bellodrama —“The Story of the
Rosary”—wherein Madge Fabian and Frank
Plarvey will appear as much the same sorts
of heroine and hero as Madge Mclntosh

and Ilarcourt Beatty used to be the last
time a Walter Howard drama was staged at
the Royal.
Four new “turns,” all from ’Murka, were
put into the Melbourne Tivoli bill last
Saturday, but none of them earned as much
gratitude as Jack and Foris, who are not
new, or Cardo and Noll, whose warbles have
been familiar for weeks past. Louis London
is a loud-voiced singer of the songs that
touch one’s liver, and Dan Ahearn is a whist-
ling fiddler, with no marked genius for either
fiddling or whistling. Kelly and Fern are a
pair of “speciality.”-mongers who can dance
'and blend their Amices better than they can
specialitise. No. 14 on the bill —Clarence
Wilbur —is a long-winded professor of
“trampology,” which means talk, and the
audience might do worse than give him
sixpence to go away.
Estelle Wordette is now giving the Amur-
kan language a night out in a honeymoon
sketch at Melbourne Bijou. The young
lady, who makes a fairly pleasing picture
as a newly-wed in lavender, is loudly abetted
by a patter-partner named Miller, who
. apparently suffers from the strain of keep-
* ing a smile playing on a countenance more
suited to the expression of grief. Pollard
and Jackson are new warblers ; Perona, the
piano-accordionist, is reappearing; Mon-
tambo and Wells' are tumbling again with-
out any flourish or fuss; and Harrington
Reynolds is busily turning his pathos on and
off in another semi-demi tragedy called “A
Remittance Man.”

Marlow’s quick-change Shakspeare season
at Adelaide Royal was a marked success.
The mounting was adequate rather than
sumptuous, but the acting was good all
round. Wilkie finished with a manly decla-
matory Othello and a sententious Jaques,
leaving lago and Orlando to the reliable -
Walter Hunt; and he took Sliylock on the
dignified Irving lines. Cosgrove left the
comic parts to Landor, himself appearing
as the banished Duke and as a portly melan-
choly Antonio. Miss Hunter-Watts was
delightful as Rosalind to Elwyn Harvey’s
Celia, Valentine Sidney rollicking through
the part of Audrey. She also rollicked some-
what as Nerissa; for that the lady law-
clerk should land her husband one on the
solar plexus with a heavy law-volume on
leaving the court is certainly not so set
down in the bond. The Royal has now
reverted for a bit tp its “strong,” uncom-
fortable Theda Bara picture-drama. Won-
der-graph and West’s compete with mostly
American stuff. Brandon-Cremer has melo-
drama at the Tivoli, where Conway is the
priest in “The Confession”; and at the
King’s Ayr is Dave Kingsley in “The Power
of Love.” The Majestic bill is brightened
by Bain and little Verna, Harry Farrow—
last in Adelaide as a pantomime dame —and
Leonard’s hounds.
“Glen PI.”: The most capricious of stars
could not cause a management more uneasi-
ness than does. Adelina, da monk carried

The offensive was resumed with a long pole,
but it was not until the interval had been
extended by quarter of an hour that the
enemy was dislodged. What form the
monkey’s counter-offensive will take has not
been disclosed, but, having sat through
“Romance” once, all my sympathy is with
the animal that has to suffer-it six nights a
week. It seems like a case for the S.P.C.A.

announced, was always a bit odd in his
manner. His eccentricities provided many
diverting bar parlor anecdotes. Once he ap-
peared on the main street of the popular
suburb in which he was residing in the full
“make-up,” costume and hair of an eccen-
tric character in which he was about to
appear. His fantastic aspect drew such a
crowd that the police were constrained to
interfere, and invite the perambulating freak
to shift his beat. Lissant was very angry.
“Damme, sir,” he snorted, “I am to play this
character, and I desire to become absorbed
in it—absorbed in it, you understand. Now,
how is a man going to absorb himself in a
character if lie’s kept continually jumping-
out of it to satisfy the conventionalities
of a community that can’t mind its own
business, and is unwilling to let an
honest man mind his?”
The latest Australian mummer to go into
camp is J. Beresford Fowler, who, after
doing some very passable character work in
Repertory productions, was given a place
in the Bert Bailey co. and was appearing
lately in “Duncan McClure and the Poor
Parson.” Young Fowler also pushed a pen
and now has a novel, “A Heroine of Rus-
sia,” on the bookstalls.
“Jwosp” : The Actors’ Equity Association

plunge and affiliated its artistic soul to the

for 18 years and couldn’t be blasted out
with dynamite. An acting army of 9000
voted for the plunge and only 20 against; so
Fred Niblo is now a spruce footlight
unionist.
“The Ratcatcher’s Daughter” : Press agency
has its joys. Some time back a booster in
Sydney wrote a yarn about the lady and the
burglar. According to the press agent, or
puff merchant, a scoundrel climbed to her
balcony, whereupon she in her week-end-
going nighty, or something, shot him fatally
or thereabouts. Here entereth brother “Dry-
blower” Murphy, of the dandy West. His
wire to the press agent: “Kindly forward the
band parts of your latest canto.”
Reginald Wykeham, who pushed aside the
mummer’s powder for the powder that is
making and breaking nations, is enjoying
himself. “It’s a bit rough,” he writes to
The Bulletin, “but the call-boy couldn’t
rouse me out of it- —and I used to be more
frightened of him than anybody else in the
world.” Chumming with Wykeham are
Daryl (“Dan”) Lindsay, brother of Lionel
and Norman, and Philip Schuler, son of the
Age’s editor.
“C. Ockney” : As a result of the Compul-
sory Service Act in England, middle-aged,
not to say elderly, lovers may be looked for
in forthcoming English plays if the tender
passion is touched on at all. “Dot” Bouci-
cault is one of the first London managers
to find it impossible to stage certain
plays contracted for, on account of the
shortage of young actors. Among these
pieces is a comedy by Glotilde Graves (the
“Richard Dehan” of the libraries), accepted
months ago. Boucicault’s jeune premier,
bv the way, is that promising young man,
Martin Lewis, who scored in Australia in
“Milestones” a year or two ago. He
remains in the company, having been twice
rejected for military service, and has lately
made good in the new play, "The Riddle,”
written by Antony Wharton and Morley
Roberts.
From London :
Oswald Stoll lias not scored in his first try to
attract the London public to the splendid but
unlucky Opera House built and abandoned by the
New York Jew Hammerstein. The Melbourne man
started with musical-comedy experiments, but they
proved no good, and the vast house again has the
shutters up pending the production of a gorgeous
revue called “Look, Who’s There.”
“Jean Sibi”: Gregan McMahon reports
considerable activity in the Australian play
industry. Recently he
has received two or three
efforts that must be pro-
duced. One of them is
Adams’s kiddies’ play,
which McMahon regards
as “a charming fantasy.”
Another is the firstborn
of Howard Ashton, the
versatile scribe who is
trimming the cables for
Sydney Surf. Also the
industrious and • pains-
taking Louis Esson has
another one ready and a
couple more approaching,-
completion. It is said
that Esson so polished
and polished the first-
mentioned that the title
is now the only bond
between the first script
and the last.
“T.”: Borough Councils thinking of turn-
ing an honest penny these hard times by
running picture-shows will do well, before
embarking on the enterprise, to look into
the law on the subject. The Victorian
Council of Geelong West, after some months
of profitable movie management at its pic-
ture “Pavilion,” has just been notified by
its solicitors that its side-line is illegal, with
the result that the building has been leased
to that old soldier Private Enterprise for
five years at £352 12s. per annum. What
the Council is going to do to itself for trans-
gressing the law hasn’t leaked out yet.
Sir Frederick Bridge, organist of West-
minster Abbey, has been letting himself go
on German music. Before the war the
English musical world idiotically allowed
itself to be dominated by the German ele-
ment : “We gave them some of our biggest
posts, and paid them salaries that no Brit-
ish musician could aspire to, and they have
rewarded us by turning out the biggest set
of blackguards that any country ever had to
fight.” Batter-day German music, says
Bridge, is sheer “devilry” and accords with
the national character. Personally for the
rest of his life he won't speak' to or asso-
ciate with Hun musicians. “I walk out if
they walk in,” says he.

The Yic. Ministry intends to try to earn
its share of the Federal grant for the sup-
pression of syphilis. It has a bill on hand
based pretty much on the Westralian Act,
the only really live one on the subject in
the Commonwealth. Any doctor who treats
a case of the. disease must report it to the
health authorities; then certain restrictions
will be put on the patient to stop him from
giving the disease to anyone else, and if
he does not do as he is told he is to be
segregated till he is cured or dies.
Dr. Holtze, who has at 77 left off being
director of the Botanic Gardens in Adelaide,
was born in Hanover, but couldn’t help that.
At an early age he got out, and put in 10
years in Russia ; then, for a change, 18 at
Darwin, and 25 in Adelaide —always ill
charge of Botanic Gardens.
The Liberal party in S. Aus. has invented
a new theory. Labor says there was some-
thing putrid about the financial arrange-
ment by which an elected member of the
Assembly gave up a safe seat to let Peake,
the leader, come back after being defeated
in his own district. Liberalism says that
to allude to this in public is “hitting below
the belt,” “washing dirty linen,” a “stab
behind the back,” “taking garbage out of
the cart,” and in general the work of
“traitors and spies.” This was not the way
to purify public life, said the Liberals
pathetically; to which Lands Minister Goode
made the practical reply that “you don’t
purify a thing by covering it up.” But
when Goode was “dared” to repeat outside
what he had said inside, he wouldn’t.
“No,” said he. “Members know per-
fectly well that what I say is true, but one
cannot prove it.”
It is announced from London, probably
with an ulterior motive, that Kitchener
shortly before his death remarked that “the
German people must be punished.” The
observation has been made by any number
of people, and is neither better nor worse
if Kitchener was one of them. He
probably wasn’t —not in the sense suggested,
at any rate. He knew why Britain was
fighting. It is to break the German armies
and destroy Prussian militarism. If we
fail in that —if we only succeed in punish-
the German, while leaving the source of
mischief unimpaired—the job that was
started will not be finished. We must reso-
lutely set ourselves to the real task, and not
permit ourselves to be humbugged into
believing that Germany can be effectively
dealt with after, the war.
The other day the coal-miners of Vic-
toria, including the 1500 employed at the
State mine at Wonthaggi, indulged in what
they called a “sympathy” strike of 24
hours’ duration, to show their affection for
N. S. Wales fellow-unionists. Seeing that
this meant the direct loss of a day’s pay
to them and many others who had no con-
cern with the matter, besides indirect loss
to manufacturers who are calling for more
coal, it was a curious way of showing regard.
Perhaps next time one of these workers has
the bad luck to hear of youngsters who are
hungry, he will order all other nippers 24
hours’ starvation in order to show their
sympathy with the kids. The idea of doing
a bit extra and sending them the proceeds
for a feed is much too practical.
At the very moment when the Common-
wealth Treasurer and most other people are
talking of the national need of economy,
the announcement is made that the Sydney
Gas Co. is pouring its coal-tar into the
Pacific. Australia won’t make much pro-
gress industrially until it learns that
economy doesn’t consist so much of not
spending money as of not wasting oppor-
tunities.
Last of the Tooram (WarrnambQol)
tribe, which in 1880 numbered 200 Bingliis,
Wilmot has quitted his mia-mia for good
and gone out into the eternal dusk at the
age of about 80 years. Though the mission
station was at his disposal its restrictions
proved too irksome, and he made his home
in a bark humpy in the natural bush of
Captain Selby’s property, Clifton, on the
Hopkins River, Towards the last he was
under the kindly care of the late Jack
Murray’s sister.
Hobart Mercury now and then takes its
courage firmly in both hands and says some-
thing about the damage done by the “white
scourge,” which “should be dealt with fear-
lessly and openly, with none of that criminal
mock-modesty that has been customary
hitherto,” etc. Now, a deputation recently
waited upon the Speck’s Premier Lee with
the old. old demand that Something should
be done. The next day the Mercury
published nearly a column report under the
heading “Contagious Diseases.” And this
was as near to the dreadful word “syphilis”
as the Mercury could bring itself to go.
Anything which might give the public an
inkling of what the affair was all about
was enthusiastically censored by the out-
spoken organ. Except for a vague allega-
tion that this “contagious disease” was
spread by “women of a certain class” the
Mercury might have been talking about
any old complaint under the sun —influenza,
for instance, or mumps, or even that wow-
serism from which the Mercury itself has
so long been suffering.
Tasmania’s Public Works Committee has
only five members, but two have had sons
killed in France within a month. Th
first was the lieutenant son of James Mur-
doch, M.L.C., and the second Private Keith
Hean, a son of Alec Hean, ex-Minister for
Lands. Both boys were fine footoallers and
good sports.
NOTHING BUT HEROES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I cast myself for many roles
In this the play of Life;
The flags are flapping on their poles
When, home from foreign strife,
I come at last with beat of drum
And medals on my breast
To hear the staring people hum
And cheer their very best.
I sit in daydreams with the wise
Around the council-board ;
To quell the seething House I rise
And lunge with Satire’s sword ;
I “cut” the leather to the fence,
I kick the winning goal,
And everyone says I’m immense
And never in a hole.
The splendid girls who fawn on me
Excel all living maids;
I am as good as I can bo
Till each fair vision fades ;
Triumphal arches, flowers and bands,
High honors, love and cash
Are mine while I with grimy hands,
A grocer’s ’prentice, dash.
And when of parts I have my choke,
Why should I choose the one
In which one speaks with lowered voice
And eats a penny bun ?
Buffoon or villain I’ll not be,
But something- great of heart.
The curtain's up! The play is “Me”!
For me the hero’s part!

SOCIETY
The jaunty manner in which Tommy
Anzac will follow the King has run some
souvenir-hunting snobs right off the rails.
When George recently visited one of the
soldiers’ institutes in Regent-street, London,
the society madam in charge seized the
chance to christen a silver inkstand. She got
a new gold pen and asked the King to sign
the visitors’ book, and George duly did it.
Having seen him and his missus to their
car, Sassiety rushed back to capture the
pen and pot ere vulgar hands profaned it,
only to find a casual Anzac, the gold pen
in his hard brown fist, writing a letter to
his best girl with the aid of the sainted
inkstand.
“Vic” : A deputation of unemployed but
fastidious gents waited on Premier Peacock
in Melbourne the other day. They told him
there were 11000 of them all moaning and
longing and hoping for work —but it must
be nice, handy work, close to their city
liomes and picture-shows. No, they wouldn’t
take Bs. Od. or 9s. a day in the country.
Peacock spread his oratorical tail and gave
them the bird. The Public Works had
£173,558 worth of jobs available in the
country, and over £OOOO in road work. The
Country Roads Board had £14,400 of con-
tracts in progress, and tenders out for
£32,000. There was immediate employ for
436 -laborers who could not be got, yet the
TRUE HOSPITALITY.
HOSTESS: “But, my dear Mrs. Brown, you’ve eaten nothing.”
HOST. “Yes, you're eaten nothing at all. Won’t you hare a little, more?”
wretched deputation professed to be mostly
of laborers. On such occasions the.indig-
nant roar of the late Tom Bent must be
greatly missed at the Premier’s office.
Nevertheless, what can you expect? Gov-
ernment after Government pours out money
on the congested city’s comforts and con-
veniences. and then some Peacock is annoyed
because the people are not anxious to leave
them.
It looks as though, in the present state
of the law, the Labor newspaper will have
to depend on its merits and the loyalty of
Labor sympathisers. At Broken Hill, where
the first Labor daily in Australia has had a
rough passage which doesn’t seem to be
improving, the powerful Miners’ Assoc,
passed a bylaw requiring every member to
ante-up another shilling a fortnight, under-
taking to supply in return a copy of the
Labor daily and the weekly Sport. There
was a row, of course —there will be a row
at Broken Hill over the General Resurrec-
tion—and counsel’s opinion was taken on
the whole matter. Attorney-General Hall
and A. R. J. Watt were the advisers, and
they say:—
(1) The daily newspaper and Sport are not
“newspapers for the purpose of advocating the objects
of the A.M.A. and the essentials thereto.”
(2) The union has no power to make any rule to
enforce any payment for a newspaper.
(3) It is illegal to use the union’s funds to supply
goods of anv kind to its members.
(4) It is' not lawful to refuse accident pay and
death allowances to any member who offers to pay the
ordinary contributions without the extra contribution
for the newspaper.
And the rival paper, which, though pri-
vately owned, takes the moderate Labor
view—which seems to be the view of the less
noisy majority even at Broken Hill —is left
comfortably ' preening its lately-ruffled
feathers.

“Corporal Dry” : To show their apprecia-
tion of the ship’s staff, the military officers
on one of the transports decided to give a
farewell banquet in their honor. The menu
would have been mentioned in despatches
by any leading hotel, and the wines were of
the V.C. grade. Of course Private Billjim’s
share of the festivity was a hurried glance
through the port. He happened to be pass-
ing during a lull between speeches. “Any
complaints?” he roared, and fled as the
saloon exploded in laughter.
* * * *
“Yarra Ben” : Remember our preliminary
gush to the effect that "nothing but the best
is good enough for them”? Well, the Gov-
ernment is presenting ‘Them” on their dis-
charge with “the best” —in suits. They are
worth, so the military authorities claim, a
whole sovereign each; but somebody must
have seen the military authorities coming.
Apparently these clothes are made of cotton ;
anyhow, they are stiff, uncomfortable, and
don’t fit. As a consequence, many of the
slops are being offered to hand-me-down
palathes and pawnshops. Others with a
keener sense of humor prefer to advertise
their tailor by putting the duds on and tak-
ing a walk round to the Parliamentary
Recruiting Committee’s office. The Com-
mittee has been wondering why business in
the volunteering line has dropped off of late.
Perhaps the sight of returned heroes in
their new tailorings has made the recruitable
inhabitants take to the hush.
Good old Corporal Punishment still car-
ries two stripes in some Victorian country
schools, and if a bone or two are
broken in the process so much the
worse for the kid. A boy at Horsham
was alleged to have told a lie, so
teacher got the youngster’s head between his
knees and touched him up with a strap. In
the struggle the boy’s shoulder was dislocated,
but the local Bench told mother that that
was a pure accident and that she had better
pay fl Is. costs for making such a frivolous
complaint. The lady then accidentally fell-
to on the teacher, and by a curious mishap
pounded him with her fists in open court,
Certainly the Bench was finite fair about it:
it didn’t fine her either.
The S. Auk. Art Gallery lias for nearly
20 years held an annual “Federal” exhibi-
tion in Adelaide, buying a few pictures for
its own walls each time, with the result that
it now has a very good Australian Room.
At last, however, it considers the plan
"inadequate and otherwise unsatisfactory,”
AND IT BEGAN SO PROMISINGLY, TOO.
"Your name’s Dorothy, isn’t it? It’s a pretty name — I’m very fond of it."
“You say that to every girl you meet.”
“Yes, I do, if her name's Dorothy. It’s it’s my wife's name. We’re just married,
you know.”
“Oh!”
and has passed a resolution, moved by Pre-
sident Sowden, that the exhibitions should
be held also in Sydney and Melbourne in
turn. The local Society of Art approved
the idea —naturally, since it will help its
members to a market in the other States,
whereas the holding of the Show always in
Adelaide and nowhere else merely brought
outsiders to the Adelaide market.
“F.N.T.” on a subject that has been whis-
pered about for a long while: —
Frank Brett, who is one of the half-dozen family
solicitor* comprising the immemorial firm of Blake
and lliggall, has had the courage, or the effrontery,
to criticise Melbourne University for its methods ot
conducting entrance examinations. Brett recently
made a series of inquiries from the registrar to ascer-
tain “whether the methods are in their results good
ones for fulfilling one of the first purposes of a uni-
versity, the encouragement ot scientific education.
Tile inquiries annoyed a section of the council, which
at length threw the correspondence to the pre--.
Still, Brett claims the support of successful student-
tor hi* conclusions, which are that “a cast-iron
numerical standard is fixed, regardless of the idiosyn-
crasies of examinees and examiners, while there is
no machinery for appeal, revision or consideration in
any one case.” This, Brett claims, is “calculated to
discourage in an institution supposed to encourage.’
Brett certainly took a peculiar course in claiming
the attention of the Uni. authorities, having admit-
tedly influenced the cancelling of a £lO,OOO legacy
to the Shop; but the Shop council could do a good
deal for itself if it were to offer satisfactory replies
to the following pertinent queries: (1) llow many
entrance-examinees have paid the customary fee foi
u “once-over” of their papers after the examina-
tion? (2) How many of such examinees have been
admitted after that scrutiny? If there is any other
reply than “None” to the second query the fact ha-
had precious little advertisement, cither at the Shop
or anywhere else; and if the reply is “None, then
the Shop has had a lot of easy money for an utterly
inadequate return. No system is perfect; but there
are a good many quite well-known instances of
examiners’ injustice which go to show that the sys-
tem at the Melbourne University might be less imper-
fect than it is.
This is a true story for Mister Higgs,
to show that even if young women do spend
Billjames’s money, they have their suffer-
ings too. Edith’s young man was at the
Front and a good slice of his pay came her
way. But that was not why everyone was
worried about breaking the news to her
when word came that lie had gone down in
.action. Bhe was so devoted to him that it
was feared the shock would be fatal. The
parson was sent round and let her know the
truth as gently as possible. “Just my luck,’*
she sobbed when sin* realised it. "And my
new set of furs not half paid for yet!”

THE HANSOMS OF THE PAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“1 would rather have a hansom than a taxi any day,”
I heard the lady say.
She was married, she was merry, and two pretty kids
at play
Showed she’d lived through her romances ere the taxi
came to stay;
So I murmured to the gatepost: “There you are, now!
That’s the way !
She would rather have a hansom than a taxi!”
She would rather have a hansom than a taxi,
And she’d rather have a stage-coach than a train ;
She would rather “take the air” in a shaky Sedan
chair
Than the latest silent flier cash can gain.
oh, the clatter of the hoof's upon the asphalt,
And the big wheels out of window spinning fast !
There’s a soft look in her eyes, and she’s very sweet
and wise
When she’s riding in the Hansoms of the Past.

Two of the Law’s pubhouiids entered the
temperance bar of the Red Lion in Rundle-
street, Adelaide, where some soldiers were
being served coldly with soft-tack. It was
after six o’clock, so when one of the whisky
' terriers heard a sound in the - ice-chest
against the wall, he pounced on the thing
and threw back the lid. He was just in
time to see a slide open in the back of the
chest and a mug of beer come through the
wall, propelled by the fair hand of the Red
Lion’s proprietress. The poor lady fainted
away when hailed, and hadn’t recovered iiv
nearly three weeks’ time when the Court
assessed it as worth £lO and costs. The
forbidden beer was poured in the adjoining
bedroom and passed through a pierced ward-
robe and the wall into the ice-chest beer
exchange. It was a beautiful scheme, but
it was just short of a silencer.
“The Galloping Bug”: Thank Heavens,
there are still some people who believe Aus-
tralia is a better place to make for than
the U-nited States, though the Common-
wealth Government appears to have doubts
about it. The Paparoa bunkered at Balboa,
Panama, on her voyage from N’Yark to
Australia, and this gave black brudder an
opportunity. Twenty-five miles from the
Isthmus the first batch came to light. Their
number was 10, and they had stowed away
in order to reach a land of higher pay and
lower prices. Then several more, . black
with coal-dust and grey with fright, were
rooted out from the hunkers. Said one of
the sailors, “Y’ should ha’ seen tli’ Old
Man! Up the bridge companionway!
‘Hard-a-starboard!’ he hollers. An’ away
we went, full speed back to port.” Forty
niggers in all were found and handed over
to the U.S. military cutter at Balboa, and
the Paparoa resumed her voyage, only to
discover that there were still two on board.
They had to work their passage, and by
all accounts they earned their pay.
DISAPPOINTMENT.
“You shouldn’t talk about your husband like
that, my dear. Remember, you took
him for better or worse.”
“Ah, yes, mother; but I didn’t know his
letter was so good as it is. He’s a
wowser.”
APPERTAINING TO THE RIVAL.
“But don’t you think him a brilliant conversationalist?”
“Yes, I do, indeed —the finest I ever escaped from!”
The Hun is about to receive a nasty jolt
from Hobart, where certain well-meaning
patriots are going to form an Anti-German
Club. It’s an excellent notion. After two
years of the bitterest warfare known to
history we now propose to tell the German
he’s no gentleman and pull his tie out Gott
strafe him !
“Hamer”: In a dazed sort of way Aus-
tralia is beginning to realise that the meek
clerks have transformed
themselves into militant
unionists. Ten ago
there was only the Vic-
torian Clerks’ Union in
Australia, and it was
moribund. A society was
formed in Sydney in 1908
and had a rough pas-
sage ; but it lived through
the gales and put the
kick of life into the Vic-
torians. About six years
ago the Melbourne timber
clerks went on strike and
got what they wanted;
but nothing else was done
of any moment until the
last year or so. Now
there are two clerks’
unions working in N.S.W.
—the Federal Union,
with branches all over
Australia, and the
N.S.W. Union, which has
so far refused to join
in, but has a wages board
sitting under the State
Industrial Act. Awards
have already been secured
in Vic. and W.A., and
there have been half a
dozen strikes of clerks
already this year, includ-
ing the latest on the
Fast-West railway. Gen-
tlemen, .Hi'. Inkbottle
has become a dangerous fellow!
“X-Swords”: A blood-bespattered figure
wandered down the communication trench
in the dark and fell headlong in a lnilf-faint
into the padre’s dugout. He had a severe
wound in the mouth and could not speak,
but he motioned to the padre that he wanted
to write. The padre supplied the materials,
and this was the confession with which his
soul was bursting: “The blanks can’t stand
the blanky bayonet!”
“Riinu”: Something that looks like
reform is to be seen on a square of card-
board nailed inside the smoking compart-
meat of Sydney trams, and set-
ting forth that children travel-
ling in that part of the caravan
will be charged full fares. Why
women rush the “smokers” is a
question for the psychologist.
A mother with six infants will
invariably choose the place
where the tobacco fumes are, in
preference to any other; and,
as a consequence, the nyau
behind the pipe has frequently
to stand while the women’s
natural part of the show is half
empty. Collecting full fares for
the children may do some good,
but a complete remedy will not
be found until a regulation
if made that all women occupying seats in a
smoker must light up on a cigarette being
offered by the conductor or ticket inspector.
“ J. 8.” : I predict a great scrapping of
outworn ideas and a better national tone
when our 200,000 and odd legionaries come
home. There’s no education like foreign
travel, and the bonfire of patriotism is
going to flare up so brightly that all the
old dingoes will break for the bush. Amongst
other things we are going to get from the
inspiration of France are good roads. This
is where incompetent local officialdom
will ‘‘.stop one” and live stunned ever
after. But, best of all, Australia, and not
some place on. the other side of the world,
will be “Home”!
The old steamer Richmond, alias Haupiri,
once a smart packet in the Auckland-
South Sea Islands trade and later <•<>"st-
imuli ng for the Union Co., went a long way
on her last voyage. She was "bought
foreign” last year and vanished from Maori-
land waters. Now a sailor just back from
London River tells a story which goes half-
way round the world. The Admiralty
bought the Haupiri, and she trudged the
Indian Ocean by way of Mauritius, thence
to the Cape, where she loaded wheat for
Marseilles. By great good luck she got in
and out of the Mediterranean unexploded
by Hun torpedo, and waddled serenely into
the /Thames. Then the Lords of the
Admiralty packed her off somewhere across
the Channel, and filling her with cement
sank her to block a traffic-way used by the
enemy; and the Lords sent the old crew
back to Moaland in style, passage paid and
nothing to do but eat their heads off.
“Haka”: “Medical etiquette” sailed too
close to the wind again at Auckland (M.L.)
the other day. A machinist in the Railways
at Newmarket named Alexander Burns had
a sick child who was being attended by a
Hr. Dudley. One midnight the child
became seriously ill, but I)r. Dudley was
not available. The position was then put
before one Dr. G. L. Cawkwell, who
regretted that he could not interfere with
another doctor’s patients. The Child died.
Next day when Burns called on Cawkwell
and informed him of this the doctor
replied: “Wliat lias that to do with me?
Dr. Dudley is your doctor.” Burns became
angry, and the ensuing argument ended in
a charge of assault against him. The
magistrate reckoned that when Burns called
the doctor should have been at least more
tactful to a stricken man. and dismissed tin-
case. Cawkwell intimated that had In-
known the child was dying In- would have
attended it. As in- didn’t go to see whether
it; was dying or not. presumably his gift of
second sight failed him on this occasion.
Much the same kind of thing happened
at Manly (N.S.W.). There a boy fell over
a cliff and was badly smashed. A Dr.
MeVittie was called, and after giving first
aid sent the wreck to the local State-
endowed hospital, This much-used institu-
tion hasn’t a resident doctor, and of local
medicos four only are on the “honorary”
staff. MeVittie isn't one of the four ; so lie
couldn’t follow his patient inside the ward.
There wasn’t any other doctor in attendance
either. One of the four was rung up, but
he was “fearfully busy,” and as the matron
didn’t think there was any immediate
danger he didn’t come till next day—when
the perverse youngster insisted on dying.
Possibly had the whole four been on hand
the little Australian’s life wouldn’t have
been saved; all the same, he should have
had a better run for his money. What is
everybody’s business is nobody’s business,
and it may be necessary to appoint a chosen
few local Sawboneses to run a hospital;
hut, even so, the Chief Sec. might consider
whether it wouldn’t be a fair thing to insist
that any registered medical man should be
entitled to follow up his patient and remain
in charge—at any rate till one of the privi-
leged practitioners formally takes command.
“Lee-oh” introduces another tea-clipper
man:—•
Captain Joseph Crane, of the William Mitchell (B.
29/6/T6), is not quite the last of the old school of
THE UP-TO-DATE LOTHARIO.
“ What’s Stacker (jot now—the latest vaude-
ville star ?”
“No —‘husband somewhere in France.’”
China tea-tracle racing- shellbacks. Captain Tom
Bowling-, late skipper of the Shaw-Savill sailing-ship
Invercargill, and now living in Christchurch (M.L.).
learned sailoring in the Wynaud, and for years sailed
in the splendid fliers of the China and East Indies
business. An exciting affair of those roaring years
of sail was the great race between the Wynaud and
the Assyrian. The Old Man tells how his ship sailed
a day after the Assyrian, but soon caught her, and
the whole voyage round to London was done in close
company. The two ships passed the Malay Straits
almost abreast, there was only a day’s difference
between them roun'ding the Cape of Cood Hope, they
passed St. Helena the same day, and the Wynaud
pushed into the Thames just a tide ahead of the
Assyrian. Lying at Shanghai the Wynaud’s people
saw the bombardment of the city by the British and
American sliips in the days of Chinese Gordon. The
little flier —she was only 521 tons—-was originally
an opium clipper, built to run cargoes from Calcutta
to China. Pirates, too! —every sailor those days
had to be something of a gunner and musketeer.
The Wynaud carried six nine-pounder brass guns
mounted on carriages on the main deck, and the guns
were always kept loaded in China and Malay waters.
There was a full stand of muskets, too, with boarding-
pikes and cutlasses in racks round the main and
tnizzen masts.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She was a simple little tiling-,
With wistful eyes and nut-brown hair
Of which this hard was wont to sing
Within these pages yesteryear.
She told me 1 had all her heart ;
She wept to think that we might part.
She’s still as simple, still as small,
And wistful still her brown eyes glow,
But I am pushed against the wall,
And she has got another beau.
She tells him that he is her dear—
They’ll wed before the Summer's here.
I heaped reproaches on her head ;
I called her fickle, false and vain.
“But he is rich and old,” she said.
In bitter speech 1 voiced my pain.
She was not hurt, she was not vexed,
But winninglv she said: “You next!”

AUSTRALIA’S PANTHEON: SOME HUMBLE SUGGESTIONS.
King O’Malley, Minister for Home Affairs, in granting permission for the erection of a statue of the late Cardinal Moran at the Federal capital, said the idea
was to have a park in the capital which would be the site of statues to eminent people. It would be a kind of Pantheon as they had at Rome.

Bill started to mix the rudder with the bow-
sprit young Dick signed on as one of the
crew of a transport allegedly bound for Eng-
land, and being unable to get his discharge
at Suez, where the troops were landed, he
returned to Maoriland and enlisted. After
some months at Gallipoli he dropped anchor
in France, where two brothers are still doing

Langdon Bonytlion, of the Adelaide
Advertiser, has realised one more of his
ambitions, and, though not a University
man, has got a seat on the University
Council, vice Girdlestone, late headmaster

cricketer, was nominated ; so was Bonytlion.
Caterer is acting head of St. Peter’s;
Bonytlion is Chairman of the School of
Mines in Adelaide, which in some matters
rather rivals the University, and in some,
such as electrical engineering, works jointly
with it. Parliament, which tends more and
more to have a hand in the working of both
bodies, has intimated that they had better
pull together still more, so Bonython seems
needed on the University Council, and
Caterer in the most "sporting” manner
withdrew. As he was one of the Univer-
sity’s earliest graduates, and has for years
done good work as Clerk of the Senate
(which in Adelaide means the whole body
of graduates), he ought to find another
vacancy on the Council hefore long.

“Reditor” introduces four scientists :■
After much finessing - it has been decided that Hugh
Pye shall drop out of Dookie College in Septembei
and stick to wheat-breeding. His association with
Dookie extends over 27 years, for 25 of which he lias
been principal. His first work as a wheat-breeder
was in collaboration with Wm. Farrer, and he had
much to do with making Federation wheat popular
in Victoria. Working by himself, he has produced
many new varieties of grain, some of which, like
Warden, Improved Steinwedel, Currawa and Major,
have achieved considerable popularity among growers.
Currawa, introduced to the public only a few seasons
ago, has done particularly well in Westralia with its
light sandy soil and very small rainfall. Pye has
also done a lot of work on the production of macaroni
wheats. As his successor at Dookie the tipsters have
fixed their attention on ex-science master Lambden
and Stranaghan, formerly English master. LambiLn
was a State-school teacher who did the Agricultural
Science course at Melbourne University. He recently
left for the Front as a major. Stranaghan will be
leaving shortly as a lieutenant in charge of rein-
forcements. The friends of F. J. Bae are asking that
his claims should not be overlooked. He is a State-
Ischool teacher who has spent some time at the Mel-
bourne “shop” and can write more letters after his
name than any other man in the Victorian Education
Department. He also has enlisted, and when last
heard of was doing his bit as a sergeant in the
artillery somew’here in France.
Is there another case like this? Lieut.
B. G. Littler, of Davenport (Tas.), has
won a Military Cross in France ; and his
father bagged a D.S.O. at Gallipoli.
Poor J. L. Nanson, who has died in Eng-
land after a very long illness, was one of
the ablest politicians Australia has known.
In the opinion of some his best speeches in
the Westralian Assembly were as good as
any ever made in an Australian Parliament.
Despite a defect in his utterance, he
invariably attracted an eager audience,
and when he was really fired he rose easily
to the higher heights of eloquence —a
measured eloquence that charmed the ear
and commanded the mind. He could not
stand criticism, however, and thereby hangs
a tale. Once Wallace Nelson, annoyed at
his constant interruptions, told him to keep
cool. “You’ve got your wool off, anyhow,”
exclaimed a Nansonian admirer, referring
to Nelson’s baldness. “1 plead guilty,”
retorted Nelson. “Nature has been as
ungenerous to the outside of my head as
she has been to the inside of yours.”
Jack Meehan, the N. S. Wales ex-politi-
cian who used to be distinguished by the
geniality with which he offered to punch the
nose of his brother man, has added another
accident to his fall over the stairs at Parlia-
ment House. This time it was some bricks
that fell, and John never stopped such hard
bricks before. He is now in hospital con-
templating old times in the Assembly before
his seat disappeared off the electoral map.
Recently he has been employed at the Stores
Department, Darling Harbor.
“Boyd Cable,” Buldetin correspondent
and officer of artillery, left London and went
back to his guns in France last week. His
book of vivid battle sketches, “Between the
Lines,” is being followed by another on
munition work called “Doing Their Bit,”
and No. 3, “Action Front,” is in the press.
TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF.
ELSA: “Dear Hans, how fortunate it was
only your arm! If your face had been

The Melbourne City Council hasn’t parted
forever with its old servant, ex-town clerk
John Clayton—not if John Clayton can help
it. There is to be a vacancy in the repre-
sentation of Lonsdale ward next November,
and didactic John is going to do a dash for
it.
Arrived lately to tfeach the young idea how
to fly at the State aviation school at Rich-
mond (N.S.AV.), W. J. Stutt and Andrew
Lang—two Australians who learned their
business with the Royal Flying Corps at
Farnborough (Eng.). Stutt, who is a native
of Hawthorn (Vic.), was acting as chief test
pilot at Farnborough when the home job
called him, and he did several flights over the
picnic ground in France. Lang is a Corowa
(N.S.AV.) native, and put in 12 months on
the Farnborough instructional staff.

Sergeant Wykeham Harry Freane, of the
Ist Battalion A.1.F., who has brought a
D.C.M. back to Sydney, has been fighting
for more than half his life, and doing it in
five continents. Born in Canada 30 years
ago, he drifted down to Mexico, and at 10
got mixed up in a revolution there. He
went back more than once to lend a hand in
subsequent dust-ups, and became a captain
in the Mexican federal army. Coming to
Australia two years ago, he started farming
at Glen Innes (N.S.W.), but had not quite
finished beating his sword into a plough-
share when Bill broke loose. Freane was
among the first to enlist, and got away to
Egypt with the first draft. He was in the
landing at Gallipoli, was six'times wounded,
and took the count at Lonesome Pine. After
a spell in an English hospital he got back
to Egypt and was in a camp on the Asiatic
side of the canal for a while, but his old
wounds found him out and he was sent back
to his Australian farm.
,T. W. Payter, now aged 79, was god-
father of the first cable message which left
Australia. He joined the Melbourne E.T.O.
staff as a junior in 1855, when it (consisted
of five men. and was a senior < operator
when the Vic. and Tas. Governments jointly
spent £(>0,000 in laying a cable from Cape
Otway to Circular Head (now Stanley),
by way of King Island and the Hummocks,
lie despatched the initial message, which
whizzed under the Straits on September 0,
1859. The cable, which was 240 miles long,
was pounded to pieces on the rocks in six
months. Years later a second cable was
laid from Flinders to the Tamar Heads by
a British co., subsidised to the tune of £4200
a year by the Speck. It worked well until
superseded by the Federal Govt.’s cable.
George Gavan Duffy, the solicitor who
defended Roger Casement, is a son of
Charles Gavan Duffy’s third marriage. The
first produced John Gavan Duffy, the well-
known Melbourne attorney and ex-Cabinet
Minister; the second, Justice Frank Gavan

Duffy (all that are qualified) are in the war
—which isn’t a bad record for a to
the backbone and spinal marrow,” as the
old man called himself soon after landing in
Melbourne in the long ago.
The bronze figure of Sturt, just arrived in
Adelaide, seems to be, as Agent-General
Young suggested after seeing it. at the foun-
dry. the most “alive” statue in that city, bar-
ring the equestrian Soldiers' Memorial by
the same sculptor, Adrian Jones. The ex-
plorer is shown in shirt and breeches, with
leggings and cabbage-tree hat. He is lean-
ing slightly forward and looking into the dis-
tance, the clean-shaved face being shaded by
one hand. Unlikely as it might seem, a
daughter of Sturt is still living, in England—
though he fought in Spain under Wellington,
more than a century ago—and she has pro-
nounced the figure lifelike.

It is important that they should be properly fashioned, that is
to say, woven into shape, and not merely shrunk or stretched.
Socks that are fall fashioned will fit, not only when first worn, but
until worn right out.
And to ensure real comfort, woollen socks should be carefully
pre-shrunk, and all makes made in properly-proportioned sizes and
woven without seams in toe or heel.
These good qualities, besides the' attraction of exceptional
value, will be found in the lines listed here, and the many other
makes to be seen in the Hosiery Section at both Stores.

A bank like this doesn’t know for certain
what its profits are. All it can do is to say
in effect, “After being as careful as we know
how to be we think we made so much.”
Down to the end of the first half of 1914
the accounts showed that in the manage-
ment’s opinion things were a bit better
every succeeding half. At the end of the
first six months of war it was admitted that
things were not so good—that it was neces-
sary at least to put more by for contin-
gencies. A year after the war started the
b;mk said “Things fire more serious than
we thought six months ago.” and the profit
was pulled down further. But the manage-
ment is apparently quite satisfied that the
profit level had been brought down quite
low enough, and in the last two half-years
profits have got back almost to their old
level.
In view of the gravely unsettled state of
the world a very responsible bank must have
a lot of confidence in itself, having reduced
its level of declared profits, to run them up
again like thi5—£.126,773, £128,236
£133,565. But the directors of the Com-
mercial of Sydney know quite well what
they are doing. They say, in effect, that
they have looked behind the scenes and are
satisfied:—•
Ample provision lias been made for depreciation
of (Government and other stocks, and I may here say
W 5 have very fully provided for any possible contin-
gencies and losses that may arise in consequence of
the war.
Incidentally the chairman mentioned that
“a considerable amount” of undisclosed
profit had been put during the past half-year
into premises.
The truth is. of course, that the manu
of the Commercial of Sydney is great; and
at a time like this the natural tendency is
to look to the thing that is believed to be
strong. Hence, though a good deal of money
must have been withdrawn to feed the War
Loan, the fixed deposits have actually grown
during the year; and, though this bank
takes a large view of its responsibilities,
and has consequently sat down hard upon
advances for speculative purposes, it shows
also a larger aggregate of advances because
of the help it has given to producers. The
following table shows the movements in 12
months and 10 years:—

If we are to establish new industries and
add to old ones we shall need a great deal
of capital; and it is good to find that the
Commercial of Sydney has apparently some
to spare. Deposits and all other debts on
June 30 were £25,073,309. Liquid assets
represented nearly 56 p.c. of that amount;
and, unless some very special circumstances
are undisclosed, that is a position in which
a good deal of strength is wasted. Or, per-
haps, it can be put better —a great deal of
strength is being conserved for use presently
if (1) the Commonwealth Parliament gives
tlu> manufacturer the reasonable security of
a high tariff and (2) the workers of the
country put their heel on the curse of slow-
ing down and restricting production. If
they don't speed up it is scarcely worth
while bothering about a tariff or anything
else. Our goose will be cooked, anyhow.

That is excellent progress, and all the better
because the management is showing itself
strong enough to keep the dividend at 3 p.c.
while a good, solid reserve fund is being
established. It is to be hoped that the pub-
lic is giving the bank full credit for this.
Pretty often it has judged banks by their
rate of dividend, thinking most highly of
those that were paying most. Such a test is
ridiculously wrong. The lender —the deposi-
tor —is protected not by what a bank dis-
burses, but by what it hasn't disbursed.
The larger the share capital and reserves in
proportion to the deposits and other bor-
rowed money, the better the protection a
bank offers its creditors. And obviously -a
bank accumulates reserves, not by paying-
large dividends, but by hanging on to profits.
The borrower also is interested in a bank's
strength. Above all things, lie doesn't want
to* be called on to pay up at awkward times.
He therefore is wise to deal with a bank
whose position is so strong that its deposits
are likely to be added to instead of with-
drawn.
True, a small dividend may proceed from
weakness; and when a bank is paying only
3 p.c. it is certainly desirable to find out
how it stands —-to ascertain what protection
it offers the depositor and whether the bor-
rower is likely to be disturbed. First, then,
let’s see what the A.B.C. owes: £1,575,445
in inscribed deposits and £3,706,398 in ordi-
nary deposits, etc. But those £1,575,445 of
inscribed deposits are interminable except as
to £15,000 per half-year. The bank is under
an obligation to buy up that much each term,
but no more, though it may retire as much
more as it likes on giving three months’
notice. For practical purposes, therefore,
the debt is £3,706,398 and the liquid assets
amount to £1,778,008. So there is £1,928,390
of this debt unrepresented by liquid assets;
and against that debt there are £4,809,432
of other assets. In other words, an almost
exact £2 10s. of assets for every £1 of debt.
And that remarkably strong position is fur-
ther strengthened by the fact that on the
reconstruction of the old A.J.S. Bank seven
years ago assets after being written down
hard were written down harder.
A rough-and-ready'measure often adopted
to find out whether a bank’s assets are worth
what they pretend to be. and consequently
whether the reserves are the real thing, is to
ascertain what rate of interest the profits
show when calculated on capital and reserves
combined. But that is not a true test stand-
ing by itself. The rate of earnings may be
great when calculated on the basis of capital
and reserves simply because the bank mav be
using an enormous sum of deposit money.
The strongest bank may show the lowest
rate of earnings through (1) having the
smallest amount of other people’s money in
hand in proportion to its own funds, and (2)
having a very large proportion of its own
funds in gilt-edged and therefore low in-
terest-producing securities. The A.B.C.
earns net only about £4 11s. p.c. on its
funds (capital and reserves) : but note that
the ordinary deposits, etc., are not 14 times
greater than the paid capital and inscribed
deposits, while no less than 48 p.c. of the
ordinary deposits, etc., are held liquid.
The 12 months’ movements were:—
June, 1915. June. 1916.
Paid capital .. £1,195,831 £1,197,394 Inc. £1,563
Inscribed deposits 1,614,689 1,575,445 Dec. 39,244

Premises, etc... 357,237 359,623 Inc. 2,386
The figures show that the bank is steadily
commanding increased confidence and in-
creased business. It can safely take a lot
more money yet, which means that it has
the foundations on which it should be able
to build a very much larger profit. For
that reason it seems to be acting wisely in
opening a branch in Melbourne.

Those reserves include the commissions in
suspense. The co. gets its revenue from
three sources: from a single commission on
the corpus or capital value of the trust
estate, from an annual commission on the
income of the estate, and from the earnings
of its own funds. An estate worth £lO,OOO
would pay £250 in commission on the
capital value, with £l2 10s. a year, or £25
if the entire income is derived from rents
which have to be collected. But £l2 10s.
isn’t likely to cover the actual cost of
administering the estate for a year; so if
the whole £250 of corpus commission were
included as profit at once, it might easily
happen that the subsequent handling of the
estate would show an actual loss. So this
co. reserves some of the commission, draw-
ing upon it as the administration proceeds.
Of the £119,232 of reserves shown above
£40,442 consists of these more or less
unearned commissions. And because these
commissions are included as reserves they
are also necessarily included as profits in
the table. It is partly because these corpus
commissions fall in in fairly big amounts
(though they are as a rule charged against
the estates in three or four instalments)
that the profits in the table are very
irregular.
What is the value of estates on hand? —
perhaps that is the best test of the progress
of the co. Here are the figures:—
1895 .. £2,424,413 i 1912 .. £9,791,590
1900 .. 3,928,520 | 1914 .. 11.440,448
1905 .. 5,758,223 : 1915 .. 11,890,942
1910 .. 8,175,990 | 1916 .. 12,604,680
That is splendid progress; and with that
momentum the co. would take a lot of
stopping. Certainly the Public Trust Office
is likely to prove an awkward competitor,
not so much because it will take business
away as because it will tend to reduce
charges. The Fat men may not very
willingly go into the jaws of the Socialist
tiger, but they will be quite willing to say
that they won’t pay a private office more
than the tiger will do similar work for.
However, giving that probability in. it is a
fine business, doing a fine service, and with
a fine future before it. Yet it takes practi-
cally no risks. It is possible to put almost
every penny of the funds in gilt-edged
securities: as a matter of fact, this co.’s
little lot is in city premises (completed
during the year), £117.175; mortgages, etc.,
£11,434; cash and public securities, £55.331.
Its liabilities are £13.440.

The business continues to grow; but the
profits are not what they were, for all that.
The revenue is all right; but if the expendi-
ture rode a motor-bike it would be fined
20s. for exceeding the speed limit. The
profit for the past six months was exactly
the same as for the period ended June, 1912.
But see how some other things have differed :
June, 1912. June, 1916.
Value of estates in hand £9,457,494 £11,674,063
Interest earnings . . 1,294 1,967
Commission earnings . . 11,382 13,555
Salaries, etc. . . . . 6,000 7,706
Stationery, etc. .. .. 1,396 1,837
Taxes and law costs . . 239 793
Sundries . . .. . . 26 169
It seems a fair thing in this case to include
law costs with taxes, because presumably
the bulk of the increased law costs are due
to new taxation and the need to protect the
co. when dealing with this matter as it
affects trusts. The increase in salaries is
also to some extent the result of new and
complicated taxes. However, though the
co. is thus getting hit both directly and
indirectly, the co.’s services are being every
year more largely employed; and that is
the important thing, because, after all, the
increased taxation won’t last for ever, and
in any case it is its newness which is
responsible for most of the perplexities that
cost a trustee co. money.
The co.’s share capital is £90,000; the
reserves consist of a formal reserve fund of
£50.000, an investment fluctuation fund of
£6416. and £lOl9 of undivided profit. This
£147,000 is represented by £50,000 of public
securities, £50,000 in city freehold (these
premises cost £69,348), £42,000 in mort-
gages and the balance of £5OOO (after pro-
viding for the current dividend) in cash.
There is little danger of serious depreciation
here. Certainly the market value of public
securities may shrink, but the stocks are all
terminable, and in every case but one the
co. has valued them at less than the face
value. And though the earnings of the co.
have suffered, the reserves are now so fine
that if the co.’s funds bring in but 4 p.c.
the co. lias only to add £1320 net per annum
from its business to provide the shareholders
with an 8 p.c. dividend.

Liabilities.. .. .. 1,021 1,459 1,918
Surplus liquid assets.. £95,186 £98,440 £107,055
Fixed deposits and other securities have
been increased from £62,901 to £73,814; but
the bank balance has been reduced from
£4505 to £461. Thus one way and another
the co. has £S6IS more liquid assets than it
had six months ago, although meantime it
has paid £14,081 in dividend.
During the past 15 years the co. has
presented its accounts in about a dozen
different ways. Just at present it shows the
profit after providing for depreciation. In
other words, the alleged profit depends
wholly upon the amount bitten off ostensibly
to cover wear and tear. Six months ago
steamers and freeholds were valued at
£182.905. They now stand at £174,119. or
£8786 less. Presuming that nothing has
been sold during the period, this means that
the co., besides earning the dividend, has
paid for all repairs, renewals and additions,
and has put by £8614 towards a renewal
fund. Going back further the results ate
more striking still. In seven years £72,565
has been added to liquid assets, £81,009 to
freeholds and leaseholds and plant, and an
unknown amount has been spent on the
steamers. Not a penny of this has come
from new capital: the additions made to
capital during the period have been all
bonus additions. And meanwhile, of course,
the very fat dividends have been paid.
Whether the next seven years are going
to equal the past seven The Bulletin
doesn’t know. On the one side there is the
steady growth of population ; on the other
there are ever-increasing exes., and the time
will certainly come when the local
authorities will demand a still larger slice
of the takings.

No doubt in order to make a clearance with
a view to simplifying income-tax problems,
the whole of the undivided profits, after the
last appropriations, have been turned over to
formal reserve funds, and £l5O has dropped
ou.t— —apparently* written off something un-
specified. Earnings are fairly well sustained.
They were £3526 as compared with £3712 in
the half-year before the war. But exes,
are romping ahead. Compared with the
latter half of 1915, they were nearly £5OO
more. For 1910 the taxes alone were £69S;
for the past year £2315. The co. has a
share capital of £30,000, and a debenture
debt of £15,000 (it paid off £5OOO during the
six months). A few other liabilities are
more than covered by liquid assets. The co.
doesn’t aim at being a great money-maker;
but it probably won’t stop at 6 p.c. (down to
1902 it paid 7 p.c. or upwards), and the
security for the principal is unimpeachable.

W. R. CAVE, General Manager,
263 George Street, Sydney.
Queensland is to have an electrolytic
works at Bowen, and the neglected town has
become excited in consequence. Bowen
possesses one of the finest ports on the
Australian coast, but has suffered by the
stronger political influence that Townsville
could call to its aid. In fact, Townsville
made a great bid for these works, which are
being established by Mount Elliott; but
Minister Bill Hamilton, reckoning it was
time to give Bowen a lift, managed to pull
down the scales. The Bowen landowners
thought they had a fine chance to put up
values when Mount Elliott began looking
around for a site, but when there was a
possibility of the co. abandoning the idea,
they fell over each other in their efforts to
cut prices. The works will employ 250 men
and will be a good customer to the State
coal-mine, which a new line is opening up.
The Australian General Electric Co., corner Went-
worth Avenue and Goulburn Street, Sydney; corner

"Doctor'': Apropos surrender values, let
me add my testimony. The insured effected
an endowment policy with the A.M.P. for
£2OO in June, 1906. He paid only four
annual premiums of £8 Os. Bd., or £B2 2s. Sd.
in all. A month ago he received a notice
stating that the policy was still in force,
but that he owed £7l 19s. 9d. for overdue
premiums and interest. lie was urged not
to allow the policy to lapse, and was in-
formed that he would be granted a loan of
£7B to enable him to liquidate his debt. At
the same time he was told that the surrender
value of the policy was £B7. These figures
are remarkable when it is remembered that
only £32 had been paid in premiums. Surely
even the Queensland Minister of Justice
doesn’t expect anything better.
These picture cos. know how to pile up the
goodwill items. Fuller’s Pictures, Ltd., of
M.L.. has a capital of £103,378, of which
no less than £85,787 is represented by "in-
terests in leasehold properties, plant and
goodwill.” Apart from this item the
assets total £29,982 and the liabilities are
£5907, leaving £24,075 net = 4s. Bd. per
share. The bulk of these other assets consists
of stock. The security for the principal
therefore looks very poor. But presumably
people who buy picture shares don’t want
a. gilt-edged investment. They want a big
return. In this case, unless they got in at
something a good deal less than par, they
haven’t much in that way either to
cheer about. Last year’s profit (the year-
ended on April 10) was £5958, and a 5 p.c.
div. takes £5109. But even that profit depends
wholly upon whether a proper amount was
written off plant, stock and especially lease-
holds, and on that point no information
whatever is forthcoming.
Great Cobar created a mild sensation last
week when a number of employees were dis-
charged and one furnace was closed down,
though it was only started a couple of weeks
ago. The local press asked the management
to explain, and was supplied with the follow-
ing : -
The operations of the past nine months, with a
concomitant development of adverse factors, some
seriously decreasing- the daily tonnage production,
have evidenced that the Cobar copper mine is not
now able to supply enough suitable ore to keep two
smelters in blast. As a consequence, one furnace
was closed down at the latter end of last week,' and
the labor force was somewhat reduced.
But it’s a pity a little more detail was not
supplied,, especially as to the "concomitant
development of adverse factors.” It looks as
though this concomitance occurred within
the last fortnight, otherwise why was the
second furnace started? Apparently the
most adverse factor is ineffective manage-
ment. Underground work is gradually get-
ting from bad to worse. At Cobar Gold and
Cliesney mines it is the same: the best and
easiest smelted ores are being picked out.
Cobar Gold is actually using up a small
reserve heap put on the surface by previous
managements. Unless the policy of saving
fid. and losing £lO is discontinued something-
very serious isn’t far away.
**' * *
Mount floppy (Cobar), the premier gold
mine in N.8.W.. has held its annual meeting
in London. For the year 1915 the 00 head
of stamps ran 296 days and crushed 79,540
tons for 40,8610 z. bullion. Working costs
have been reduced Is. 3d. a ton (to 225. 5d.)
notwithstanding the increased cost of sup-
plies, etc. Battery overhaul, fine grinding
and a concentration unit are responsible for
an improved recovery of 1.40 p.c. and a
reduction of ,4dwt. in the value of the resi-
dues. The extraction is now 80.23 p.c. and
the average value of the residue I.2Bdwt.
Ore reserves are 215,950 tons, or 16,397
tons more than the previous year’s estimate.
This does not include any ore under the
700 ft. level nor about 100,000 tons at shal-
low depth near Taylor’s shaft, which will
be available when a new shaft is sunk away
from the lode formation. A vigorous policy
of development has been carried out during
the year and important discoveries have
been made, more particularly the Western
leg extensions on Nos. 2, 4 and 5 levels.
Special attention has been paid to the intri-
cate folds and twists of this peculiar ore
body. Diamond drilling has been in progress
with favorable results. The revenue account
shows a total income of £120,008 and a
profit of £20,936.
C.S.A., copper, silver, lead, zinc and pos-
sibly brass mine near Cobar, is beginning
to look as though it intends to commence
smelting. No doubt a start can be made ;
but the outsider shouldn’t get too excited.
It isn't every class of ore that is easily
treated in a water jacket furnace at a profit.
When the excitement commences people will
also need to remember that the water supply
is rather limited. Of course a thousand or
two will remedy that; but meantime it may
cause trouble.
* * * *
To dovetail the half-year’s figures of
Bodangora, Mitchell’s Creek (N.S.W.), isn’t
an easy job. If 4352 tons gave £13,578 and
profits were £5071, then £8507 went some-
where. But mining costs are set out at
£8402, and office, etc., took £Ol7 more. On
that basis costs work out at £9019, or £2
Is. 4d. per ton, against a recovered value of
£8 Is. 4d. per ton. Bullion on hand when the
books were opened for the term may account
for the difference, but in any case the sum
involved is small. The point is to get a stan-
dard to set against developments. Thus, if
costs can be held at about the £2 mark, work
like that done at the No. 9 level will pay, as
there 211 ft. in the west drive have averaged
£8 Is. lOd. for ore proved. In the extreme
points prospected at No. 8 level and at No. 6
the half-year’s work has been mostly in £2
stuff, which is below the costs standard just
set out. To-day the battery is feeding from
No. 8 and No. 9 levels, and it is the exten-
sion of the shoot at the latter point and the
prospecting of Mitchell’s reef half a mile off
that are to till the gaps in the future. By
the way, isn't it time Dyason’s office turned
out an estimate of ore reserves for this show?
•* * * -X-
Ida II (AY.A:) has just made the aston-
ishing announcement that it is on the look-
out for tributors. Twelve months ago ore-
reserves actual and nrobable were estimated
at 13,000 tons, and towards the end of 1915
“good developments” were reported, and
shareholders were led to believe that by sink-
ing a new shaft and removing the surface
plant to a new site costs would drop with a
thud and the mine again pay dividends.
This work has just been completed at a cost
of £ll,OOO, and the co. is now asked to ex-
plain why it finds itself unable to do what
it promised.

AVestralian Mines Development Syndicate,
which claimed some time ago to have bought
a mining area in AA r .A. for £2OOO cash and
880,000 shares, now announces that it has
acquired at a small outlay a quarter in-
terest in an option over a “farm” in the Far
East Rand. The official circular refers in
glowing terms to the prospects of the
ground ; but the crowd behind the scenes is
still willing to sell ss. shares for 2s. aniece.
The whereabouts of the 4\ r estralian property
seems to be known only to the Board.

“Broker” : Isn’t it time that an end was
put to the fuss over the Edna Central
blunder ? Granted that R. Williams muddled
up a code and gave a high assay, what
then? No mine ever was made out of an
occasional patch of rich stuff. That is why
Hoover, King, Newman, Clayton and Blake-
more discard rich specimens and measure
up on average-grade material. If the Cen-
tral market hadn’t been puffed up by the
hot-air talked before, at and after the last
half-yearly meeting, there wouldn’t be the
need to wire daily results. The programme
from the jump in this respect has been
wrong; but the market asked for daily dop-
ing and got it. No one could expect a 9oz.
patch to be typical of the ore from a shoot
that had only stood up to a 9dwt. average
from the quartz crushed. Therefore, those
that jumped in at the posting of the 7205.
wire were either bears out for cover or
plungers without mining sense. They de-
served to be potted by the man with the
pluck to sell. The talk of “Doc” Carr,
Chairman of the Adelaide Stock Exchange, is
merely play to the gallery, unless he, means
to get his committee to round up a Royal
Commission to see if there was any hanky-
panky in the business. To talk of the
Stock Exchange going through members’
books is pure foolishness. Rules or no rules,
it is very doubtful if any legal right to do
such a thing is conferred on any governing
body of the Exchanges. What could have
been done was to strike Edna Central off
the stock lists, but that would have hit
every shareholder off the market. I sym-.
pathise with Williams for his bad luck, and
won’t believe, on the business done, if
nothing else, that his error was more than
an accident as the result of a mining man
having to rush code messages daily to
Queen-street, when a carefully-prepared
weekly summary would have sufficed, and
also given a better average of the stone
being driven into.

At the Great Boulder meeting chairman
Doolette pointed with pride to the fact that
the mine had paid quarterly dividends for
20 years and that the total disbursements to
date amounted to £1,085,000. As regards
reserves, he claimed that the estimate given
was very conservative, and that manager
Hamilton generally kept about one-third up
his sleeve. As for the other properties
which the co. is testing, Doolette said that
the Alaskan one was shut down until a
more propitious time, when the Board could
either dispose of it or work it. The pro-
spects of the Magdala, at Stawell (Vic.),
were unimproved, and work now in progress
would decide whether the show was worth
having. He was unable to see that the co.
could be held liable for payment on excess
profits under the War-time Profits Tax,
as “where production had been speeded up
it was simply drawing on future profits in
order to benefit the Empire at a critical
time.”
The question of shutting down on account
of poor outlook and increased cost of work-
ing was considered at the Boulder Persever-
ance meeting, but after discussion it was
decided to carry on in the hope that the
war would speedily come to an end and
normal conditions be restored.
# ft ‘X- w '
Linden (W.A.), where Melbourne has
lately acquired some options, is now in an
interesting stage. Several shows have
yielded rich returns in the past, but until
lately there has been practically no develop-
ment ' below water level, prospectors having
found work at depth too expensive; so below
water level the value of the field is unknown.
One of the options, the Olympic, is said to
be shaping well, and is likely to be floated.
Mining virtue is in great supply just at
present; and someone ought to sprinkle a
drop or two upon the Mount Lyell crowd.
When its crosscut at ,1200 ft. in the North
Lyell went into rich ore the world wasn’t
kept ignorant of the find ; but when a bore
recently picked up 83ft. of rich ore beyond the
limit of the main shoot and close up to Lyell
Blocks, no one was in a hurry to announce
the welcome little stranger. Of course, it
may be policy not to say too much and put
up the price of even the least-coveted
Naboth’s vineyard ; but it would be interest-
ing to know who gobbled up Block shares by
the tens of thousands before the Lyell in its
fortnightly report said as little as it could
about the discovery. The Blocks folk were
blamed; but unless they had a pei-iscope they
couldn’t know what was doing in the North
Lyell mine, and Sticht isn’t the one to allow
any game of that sort. If the buying was for
the Mount Lyell Co., well and good. If it
wasn’t, then the co. should have handed out
the news promptly, or, at least, seen that
thei-e was no leak.
ft -X- •* *
Strahan (Tas.) has been nearly dead
enough to be bulled ever since the Emu Bay
railway diverted the bulk of the West Coast
traffic to Burnie. But it sees a chance of
coming to life again, for Mount Lyell talks
of shipping the Hercules-Rosebei’y ores that
way. If the co. treats the ores at Zeehan,
it is only 284 miles to Strahan, as against
88 to Burnie, and as the grass is growing
thick on the Strahan-Zeehan line, Mount
Lyell reckons the Government will be glad
to haul the stuff cheap. The prospect isn’t
cheerful for the Emu Bay Railway Co.,
which even with the West Coast trade hasn’t
been able to pay its ordinary shareholders a
dividend in all its 20 years.
Barrister Meagher, of Melbourne, bleated
so loudly over the War-time Profits Tax that
when Trong shares began to slide, the col-
lapse was put down to his talk. Things
have gone from bad to worse since, and the
show now looks like a shrivelled tropical
plant that can’t long yield lordly fees to
Meagher and his fellow-directors. The
crowd who tripped into the market at 355.
have more than a dreamy idea that the out-
side ground through which the dredge has
been plugging may not be outside ground
after all. To solve that problem A. C. S.
Macleod, who did prospecting work at Pal-
freyman’s Tongkah Compound, is to put
down bores over the block already dredged,
to ascertain if only the surface has been
skimmed and the tin-bearing karang is left
below, or if the dredge can’t work up to
prospectus figures. If not, liow about the
responsibility of those who shovelled out the
figures? Before the float, Horton did the
check boring, and Sydney imagines him ramp-
ing round to find out the cause of the gap
between yields and bore results. A cold,
cruel bulletin is on the office notice-board
that the directors have under consideration
the appointment of a successor to the dredge
master. As Sydney gobbled up most of
the loose scrip at above the thirties, it feels
more than a bit sore.
X* ft ft
Out of the Tongkah Compound area and
the adjoining Cocoanut block 2397 tons tin
oxide have been won, the last cub. yd. hav-
ing lately been scraped up. Deducting
royalty and sundry charges £263,453 was
realised, and the co. in four years gave share-
holders £352.500, or 61s. per share on the
original 50,000 issue. On June 30 the co.
had in hand a cash balance of £14.000, its
plant, and an adjoining lease with 30 acres
of lib. tin oxide ground. Last half-year
the co.’s dredge averaged 1.8891 b. oxide,
returning £lOl 18s. 2d. per ton net. This
works out at_ 20.63 d. per cub. yd. With
costs almost 5d., the profit was 15.65 d. per
cub. yd. When treating the deeper ground
costs may be a trifle higher, but the figures
given form a basis on which to estimate the
profits that will come from the lib. ground,
in which the conditions are almost similar.
The co. lias had A. C. S. Meagher prospect-
ing in Siam; but the sluicing claim on
which he has been at work isn’t up to the
mark, so he will have to hoe up another
patch.
* * ft *
Last year 31 men were killed underground
and three at surface in Westralian mines.
Gold mining accounted for 31 of the total.
East Coolgardie (Ivalgqorlie) providing 23
of them. The injured list totalled 923, of
which 532 were miscellaneous underground
mishaps, 243 surface, 108 falls of ground, 24
in shafts and 16 blasting. The recently-
appointed workmen-inspectors should help to
reduce this butcher’s bill.

It sounds like sarcasm when a co.. voting
to wind itself up, adds a vote of thanks to
a former managing director because bv his
efforts its affairs “had so improved.” But
that is what Chateau Tanunda, Ltd., the
S.A. wine makers, did last week ; and they
meant it. The co. started in 1880. and did
well for a time, but presently had to be
financed by Elder, Smith and Co.. Ltd.,
whose claim at. last mounted up to four
times the amount of the subscribed capital.
The business was well nursed (Elder, Smith
and Co. got another vote of thanks for
that), the large stocks of wine and brandy
were well sold, the Seppelt firm took over
much of the land and plant, and now
Elder’s look like being paid in full, with
something left over for the v nateau Tan-
unda shareholders. The winding-up is
expected to' take two years.

Sydney, July 31, 1916.
My Dear Aiuni. —
Governor Goold-Adams and his wife come,
this week, for a short visit to the
Stricklands. Baby stays at home in
Bananaland. A trip to Jenolan Caves is in
the itinerary.
The Stricklands’ trip to Adelaide via
Broken Hill gave them some surprise
snacks. For instance, after having been
lost in their motors for hours they were met
in the mud and darkness by two black
brudders, who rendered first aid, and
directed the wanderers to an outstation
owned by Mr. Creswick. Is there any other
country where two motor-loads of unex-
pected visitors would receive a rousing
welcome at 3 a.m.? These got one, any-
how ; the manager put his place and his
goats (no cows available) at the mud-
splashed travellers’ disposal. For breakfast
they had sirloin of goat, and I understand
it tasted like venison. But I don’t suppose
it was any novelty to the Ministerial Canns,
w 7 ho were of the party. They must have
had it scores of times in early Broken Hill,
where much of the “mutton” never wore
wool in its life.
At one crisis in their overland trip Gov-
ernor Strickland and his eldest treasure
saw a camel farm, besides many indignant
emus who tore across the landscape to avoid
the Wild Beast. At Mount Hope they met
the oldest human inhabitant —most of the
other inhabitants were astonished goats—
who promised them bad weather. They got
it, with mud up to the axles. One stage of
21 miles was wallowed through in 10 hours
—breathless going for the cars, with the
vice-regal boss superintending the tackle that
dragged them out of the frequent bog.
A lone Bobby met them at Broken Hill —-
the hour being again about 3 a.m.—but the
town fell upon them at break o’ day. Hos-
pitality in excelsis cheered them on their
way to Adelaide. There the Galways— she
is the ideal hostess- —warmed and fed the
visitors, and produced samples from both
Houses of Parliament. For all that I don’t
think his Ex. will again choose July to
overland by motor.
But, after all, the Stricklands fared bet-
ter than Carrington, who was the first Gov-
ernor to overland to Broken Hill —he did
it on horseback. It was in the days of the
water famine, and when, on arrival, his
Ex. said that his horse should have a wash-
down he was asked whether he would have
it done with water or beer —beer would
come cheaper. That was the famous occa-
sion on which Randolph Bedford, then read-
ing proofs at Broken Hill, added “Thank
God!” to the long account of a day’s doings
that ended with “And his Excellency left for
Adelaide late last night.” It was a dread-
fully obsequious paper, too, owned by some
of the Fattest plutocrats of Melbourne.
Do you remember Captain Rolleston, who
used to be behind the naval thunder in this
port? He’s a rear-admiral now, and on the
retired list. But a sailor with a Welling-
tonian profile like Rolleston demands some-
thing more exciting than rust. So he is
worrying the Admiralty to send him to sea
again. Mrs. Rolleston was a capable dame
who generally w 7 ore black Spanish lace over
something or other in the evening.
Muriel Tower, eldest daughter of the
Arthur Towers, of The Ranch, beyond
Bankstown, walked into St. James’s out of
the wet on Saturday afternoon; and plenty
more besides the man who was waiting for
her said she was the prettiest bride of this
July. The square-jointed old church was a
bower of snowdrops, arum lilies, sweetpeas
and tall palms, and Parson Wentworth
Shields looked as if he’d got into the florists’
business. Choir boys sang their sweetest
when the bridegroom led his dainty Muriel
down the lane of flowers. He’s Sapper Nor-
man Walker, son of the late 11. Travers
Walker, of Dunrobin station (Q.). Lieut.
Iloilo Williams handed the guests into their
floral pens. A whirling fusillade of violets —
fired by brother sappers-—caught the love-
birds as they left the church. The bride’s
dress, an ivory shimmer, was covered in a
foam of Limerick lace, and her diamond pen-
dant was almost extinguished under the veil
of old Limerick —worn by mother on her
wedding day. Bridesmaid Phyllis Tower,
demure in blush pink, walked behind. The
bridal car was abloom with purple violets —-
the sappers’ color—as it honked to the
Queen’s Club nearby. There the ’groom had
amongst the guests two great-aunts, Mrs.
Garnsey (Rhodes) and Mrs. Nixon, to wish
him joy ; and Dr. Fred Higgins and Auntie
Alice came from Penrith to give Muriel a
kiss or two.
The first suggestion of an auction for
Melba’s Russian matinee melted down to the
auctioning of the boxes. Otherwise it’s a
guinea all round and 10s. a seat in the gal-
lery. Flo. Young gave £4O for her box. The
biggest bid, 00 guineas, came from an un-
known Maorilander.- The mat. opens at
1.30 p.m. on Thursday, August. 3. That is,
for those who have their seats booked. For
the gallery queue it means a start at break-
fast time. But Ivan is worth it!
Brigadier-General Wallaek has come back
from a trip to Egypt. He has been a-very
sick man, and learnt many things about the
inside of hospitals since he left Victoria Bar-
racks. We’ve got now two brigadier-
generals to pass the cake at smart at-homes.
We may collect a few 7 field-marshals before
Mrs. I-’onsonby de Snooks gives a soiree to
celebrate Peace.
It’s in the air that Joynton Smith, M.L.C.,
will look after details of Premier Billy
Hughes’s banquet at the Carlton. At any
rate, it’s not to be at the Town Hall, unless
there’s a revoke.
Artist Florence Rodway appears again in
our National Art Gallery. This time it is
with her pastel panel portrait-study of
Gladys Laycoclc. Her gallery of kiddies—
quickly appropriated by their relatives—
includes a charming morsel of humanity,
little Rosemary Shepherd. Grandfather
Merivale is the owner. Rosemary’s younger
brother is getting some final strokes from
Florence before his goldie-locks are taken
home, in pastel, to mamma. She’s Mrs.
Cyril Shepherd.
And talking of
portraits, here is
Florence herself.
As quite a young-
ster the brilliant
Tasmanian girl
won a three years’
scholarship at the
Royal Academy.
At the end of that
time, in this Lon-
don menagerie of
budding genius, she
won another, giv-
ing her two more
years in the art
classes. But the
homeland called,
and she came back
to perfect her
strong (art with
practice. In her own special line, pastel
portraits of beautiful Australian childhood,
Florence is unrivalled.
Hugh Ward and his wife and two sons go
to the TJ.S.A. this week. They are expected
here again in November. In Pittsburg,
where Mrs. Hugh used to lift up a voice in
the local choir, there’s a little tea-shop to
which her young man used to take her after
practice. His name was Hughie, and in
those days his mind wasn’t distracted by
managerial worries.
Sylvia Crace, youngest daughter of the
Crace family who used to live at picturesque
Gungahlen, near Yass, is engaged to Captain
Arthur Champion, A.I.F. His father is
now rounding up souls at Bungendore, hut
he used to tend the flock in dusty Canberra
—a pleasant ride from old Gungahlen.
Young Champion, by the way, has been twice
badly wounded, but he’s up and at it again.
Solicitor George Priddle has persuaded
Mrs. George Kilgour to change her name
again. The wedding is to take nlace shortly.
The Commercial Travellers’ Club ate its
32nd annual banquet on Saturday night. “At
the Club rooms, Moore-street,” says the
menu-card bound in tricolor ribbon. But
plans had to be changed. The Traveller's
might have eaten their guests there, but not
drunk them. No; the new law says that,
even if you pay for the liquor beforehand,
and shut up the bar, you mustn’t consume
the Curse on licensed premises after hours. So
the committee had to chase round and throw
itself on the mercy of Dick Mayor, Lord
Meagher, w 7 ho allowed the Travellers and
their guests-—Governors and Premiers and
such like —to creep into the basement of the
Town Hall and there consume the meat and
drink. For what it is unlawful to drink in
licensed premises it is quite lawful to carry
away and drink in an unlicensed cellar.
The Automobile Club planned an outing
for x’eturned wounded last week. But pelting
rain altered the arrangements, and a string
of ears whisked the men in from Randwick to
the club headquarters. These are the
premises that used to be the local Theoso-
phists’ Tabernacle, in King’s Hall. The
high perch where Mrs. Annie Besant once
reduced our astral bodies to the higher
mathematics was hung with bunting.
In an aromatic haze of cigarette smoke, a
hundred or so khaki boys loudly encored a
lively programme arranged by Gehde, After
Whitehead had sung of the Road to Man-
dalay, and Elsie Peerless had followed with
her ditties, the air was thick with applause.
I)e Robeck amused the company by tearing
his hair down over his brows and giving a
comic interlude. Miss Punch flashed a pair
of magnificent brown eyes at the boys, and
sang something soulful about a single star.
Terrific volley of “’Core”! Hon. sec. J.
H. Harris, the genial Lipman, Rupert
Minnett and A. L. Blythe, all members of
the Auto., threaded their way through the
fog to see that the cigarettes went round;
and big Forsaythe, son of the late Queen
Emma of the tropic isles, helped them. Mrs.
Christie, Mrs. Lipman, with Miss Evans—
commanding-officer of the Mosman V.A.D.’s
—pushed the refreshments about. Then
£30,000 worth of machinery and rubber
motored the boys back to Randwick.
After looking out on this wicked old world
for just over a century, Mrs. P. J. Knapp,
of Neutral Bay, closed her eyes the other
night. The cot where she was born was
located at Mont St. Jean, within gun range
of what six days later became the battlefield
of Waterloo. At the advanced age of four she
came to Australia. Her husband, who dk 1
in 1875, was on the staff of explorer Thomas
Mitchell, Kt., then a Major of Engineers.
Signaller Tom Skeyhill, blinded in tragic
Gallipoli, found a hurricane of applause
bottled up in the Little Theatre. He’s an
easy, telling speaker, who makes his points
as neatly as a veteran lecturer. Then there’s
the genuine thrill. I-n the darkness of
eternal night the youthful soldier lives
again every incident of the epic landing.
There, where the bones of the “boats of
death” now rot in the iEgean tide, Tom Skey-
hill knows the Turkish shore as you and I
know Manly. The Australian Red Cross
has already gained £lOOO from the Victorian
boy’s stirring tale of the Dardanelles.
Musician James Edward Sykes has passed
over the border, after a long illness. An
organist by accident, as it were, he was for
years Sydney’s only great accompanist at
the piano. No one has yet filled the temper-
amental Sykes’s place as the second voice,
the chorus, and the whispering orchestra
while a star singer wandered up and down
the gamut. He lies where he can listen
eternally to the music of the 'Pacific at
Waverley.
What makes me pop-eyed reading of the
great bazaar in New York in aid of the
Allies is not so much the million and a half
dollars profit as the number of Australians
who were in New York at the time. All our
capital cities were represented over and over
again in the stall-holders. Broken Hill,
Armidale, Chatswood, Darling Point, Mos-
man, Marrickville, St. Kilda —all these may
claim to have helped indirectly in getting
in that £300,000. In the dog-star days, too!
From June 3to June 21. When smart society
is out of town. But New York reeks with
money since the war started. South American
millionaires and others who used to go to
Paris have been wintering in the Uncle Sam
capital. U. Staters who used to flee from
their country by the hundred-thousand
everv summer are now discovering their own
■wonderlands. Europe tied up in barbed-wire
and horribly trenched has no pull against the
Adirondacks.
All. the allied nations were represented,
but our interest goes out to the Australian
section, the takings of which came to £4OOO.
Annette Kellerman, Marie Narelle, Eva
Mylott, Mignon Scantlebury and Mrs. P. E.
Quinn (whose husband was chairman of the
section) were actively in the effort.
German sympathisers, I’m told by Mr.
Batten, the hon. sec. of our section, held a
bazaar a few months earlier—that was in
the most fashionable season, when the mil-
lionaires were a-millioning. That the German
cylinder was sparking, as the Yanks say, is
proved by the profit, £150,000. It was really
up to the allied nations’ sympathisers to
double the amount. Which they did.
Here is a photo
of the tireless War
Chest lion, sec.,
Charles Le M.
Walker. He’s a
typical Australian,
long, moderately
lean. and looks
years younger than
his age. That I
don’t know, but he
bears with fine
courage the loss of
a son on active
service. Young
Walker had been
invalided to Eng-
land from 'Gal-
lipoli, and was
qualifying in the
Royal Flying
Corps, when his machine jibbed and threw
a most promising aerial jockey. The War
Chest is fortunate in its executive. And
trebly fortunate in its honorary sec. Most
of his working hours are given to War
Chest, business. After that he leaves off
studying the fund’s figures to check those
of his clients: lie’s an auditor in his spare
moments.
The first Symphony Orchestral concert this
season drew a big audience—mostly in
goloshes—to the Town Hall. Slapoffski
stirred the fiddlers to give a good account of
themselves by persuasive pats and strokes of
the damp atmosphere. Tne rain fell, mean-
while, with a sympathetic swish. Cyril
Monk was the solo violin. TschaiKowsky’s
“Itomeo and Juliet” having surged with all
the rows of the Montagus and Capulets,
Slap, gave way to Alfred Hill. The M.n.
musician conducted his own brand-new
sonata for trumpet and orchestra. P. C.
Bowles got far more music out of his in-
strument, as trumpeter, than devotees of its
rich relation, the cornet, would believe possi-
ble. Hill, when an infant phenomenon, used
to blow down a trumpet in windy Welling-
ton. So he knows itspporer.w r er.
Col. Bob Owen, badly wounded at Gal-
lipoli, is now O.C. at Bathurst training
camp. His efforts to get back to the fray
have been squashed by the Medical Board.
“Not lit for active service for 12 months”
was the verdict. By that time something
will have given way somewhere, so the
cheery 3rd Battalion’s commander has to
resign himself to being useful in the home
paddocks.
Our Mountains are no place for the
bachelor misanthrope these days. From
Springwood to Mount Victoria and on to
the Caves war-brides and their soldiers bill
and coo in every cosv nook, and there’s a
honeymoon-tip smile on the face of the port-
ers. It’s an ill war that blows nobody any
good.
Kathleen, a daughter of solicitor Nash, of
Walcha, has accepted an engagement ring
from Kenneth Berry. His late father was
John Berry, of Suva.
The Government Resumption Department
has lent R. M. Pontey premises in Carring-
ton street for his new fruit and vegetable
depot. He’s the Pennant Hills patriot who
organised the services of his gardening
friends last year. They became honorary
workers in the cause of the wives and chil-
dren of men on active service, and the de-
pendents of returned wounded. The Red
Cross people, seeing that something was
doing, negotiated with Pontey to amalgamate
with them in their then trifling produce, store
in Ash-street. To-day there are three floors
of vegetable-garden stuff in the raw or in
the sauce- and jam-pot. Then the executive
became troubled. It decided that the banner
of the Red Cross could not fly over the heads
of wives and kiddies of men in the firing-line.
Yet members had seen and had not altered
Pontey’s first appeal to orchardists —in which
these very people had been mentioned. Fur-
ther, Lady Helen, head of the Red Cross in
Australia, was told by Pontey what he was
doing for the dependents of men at the
Front; and her Ex. approved and
encouraged. But a little clique in the local
executive, taking the point that the Red
Cross must not do anything for the
dependents of soldiers who are actually
fighting, sent an emissary to take control
of the Ash-street depot. So Pontey made
his bow and walked out —-which is worse for
the Red Cross than for Pontey.
Governors’ wives can learn a useful thing
or two in Australia, after all. An old Govt.
House help writes that Lady Denman is now
devoting her abundant energy to poultry-
keeping and has written some very informing
articles on the subject. “She learnt a good
deal about it when she was in Australia,” he
adds casually—though nobody here ever
seriously suspected that she had leanings
towards White Leghorns.
According to a N’York friend, there are no
longer any clothes for the middle-aged and
old. But there are fewer fashions still for
youth. Even the dolly-looking kiddie in the
spring modes is like a miniature of her
grandmother. Very wide short skirts ruffed
or flounced to the waist, with a fichu to
finish ; a hat like a glorified pudding basin,
begirt with flowers; a tiny parasol, and—
there you are! The old-fashioned early-
Victorian jackets for mamma are tied (think
of it!) with a narrow silk ribbon round the
waist; the rest of them flares out for a few
brief inches over the hips. Mannequin
parades convince the most doubting Thom-
asina that the fashionable woman of to-
morrow will look as much like a French
shepherdess—of the china-ornament variety
—as possible. So long as she keeps clear of
trains in the rushed business hours, who
cares?
A former Sydney woman, Mrs. R. S.
Williams —she used to be Miss Hodge—is
rolling up her cuffs for war work. She is
in a military hospital at Epsom, where a
Lady Almoner is her boss. It sounds like a
slice carved from an old Crusaders’ joint.
Linden Richards, A.1.F., annexed Mayne
Carr at St. Michael and All Angels, Eng.
The bride’s late parent was Captain Carr, of
the TJ.S. navy.
Fancy! Billy Murdoch, the good-looking
Australian pianist who played such a rattling
game at tennis, is now in the Grenadier
Guards. Don’t you wonder how his clean-
cut features and good Australian grin will
look decorated with a Ouidaesque cavalry
moustache V
Yours affectionately.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, July 33, 1916.
Mv Dear I’arrie, —
The child wo knew as "the lion. Judith
Denman” is now sufficiently grown up to go
out on collecting raids with the girls. She
formed one of the crow of a motor-cycle
party during a recent English hold-up.
You know that the Victorian Govern-
ment won a gold medal at the Panama Exhi-
bition for a display of locally-grown furni-
ture. One of the items, a blackwood writ-
ing-table, was handed over the other day
to Governor Stanley and accepted in lan-
guage embroidered with such words as
“noble,” “bonzer” and the like. What with
his Australian-grown and -made walking-
sticks, boomerangs, chairs, trouser-racks,
Art-and-Crafty paper-knives, draught-boards
and so forth, the affable Stanley will
have an overflowing outfit for his Australian
Room when he gets “home” again.
Prof. Baldwin Sne'neer was announced to
lecture the Billjims in training at Royal
Park on “Australian Savages.” Gov. Stanley,
who was present, evidently thought the title
overstated the case a bit. Anyway, in a
few remarks of his own he said lie believed
the Australian soldier could behave as well
as anybody.
As the final kick in a strenuous struggle
the St. Vincent’s Carnival committee has
handed • a silver-and-tourmaline tarara to
victorious Queen “Powerscourt” Mills, who
came up from Gippsland to pull off the recent
penny-vote competition. By the way, there
is a cheerful legend that when the Powers-
court ranch was put up for sale years ago,
the bidding was assisted to a handsome figure
by a casual sort of bloke in dungaree pants
and accessories eti suite. When no further
bids were forthcoming, the duugareed bloke
wrote out a cheque for the amount and
tossed it to the auctioneer’s clerk,
v T ho received it in fear and trembling. The
clerk’s doubts soon turned to joy, however,
for inquiry credited the casual bloke with a
large fortune dug or otherwise procured out
of the Golden Mile. Whereupon everybody,
cheering enthusiastically, fell upon what was
left of the cold turkey and bottled beer, and
the day ended happily for all parties.
A. L. McAulay, son of the Professor who
teaches mathematics at the Tasmanian P Bl-
and writes books about conic sections and
logarithms and the fourth dimension, is fol-
lowing in papa’s footsteps. He has just
been appointed demonstrator in physics at
the Uni. here.
By mutual agreement, probably, it has
been decided who are the “six most beautiful
young ladies of Melbourne.” They are the
wife of explorer Mawson (she used to be
Pepita Delprat), Mrs. Rupert Downes, Mrs.
Charlie Lyon, the two Mount Schanek Clarke
girls (grand-daughters of torrid old Joe
Clarke, deceased), and Hilary Mackmnon. A
meeting was recently held to plan a niglit-out
in aid of the ambulance-fund of the Artists
Society and a couple of other deserving war-
objects. A pageant-play entitled “Advance
Australia” was to have been presented, and
the beauties enumerated were to have repre-
sented the six States, with Mrs. John San-
derson in the spotlight as Britannia. ( Three
cheers.) However, owing to something or
other, uo place for staging the pageant lias
been found, so the rehearsals and contribu-
tions to the various war-funds have been
postponed indefinitely.
At the Lyceum Club the other day the
Baldwin Spencer dame was presented with
a beaten-silver box by the Arts and Crafts-
people. It was a reward for occupying the
presidential chair for four consecutive years.
The National Council of Women (Ta-ran-
ta-ra!) stood on the mat at the Austral
Salon and shook hands with Miss Micliaelis,
a great Council toiler who is off for a holi-
day jaunt to America wi.tn Dorothea Spin-
ney, "the Shakspearian retailer.
Little Mrs. Stead was conspicuous all the
week piloting a six-foot soldier nephew
round town to theatres and cafes. The
nephew, young MeLellahd, comes from Syd-
ney and is following nine other brothers to
the war. The family of boys numbers 11,
and now only the youngest is sitting by the
heme fire. Every man relative Mrs. Stead
owns —there are 60 of them—is in the muddy
fighting-line or on the way there. They are
a war-loving Scotch crowd.
Melbourne is fluttering the remaining
leaves of its cheque-book and wondering how
its Russian appeal will go. A preliminary
meeting was full of tierce skirmishes, and it
things arc as merry at following rallies the
committee will need a Red Cross week on
its own. Mrs. Woolcott is Chief Buttoner,
and she was asked to take over the organisa-
tion. Some insurgents, however, wanted
organiser Jenkinson to take command.
Arguments raged and brollies were splin-
tered during bursts of applause. Lesley
Madden cried her views from the back of the
hall. To the neutral onlooker the net result
of it all seemed to be chaos; but the Wool-
cott party evidently got the verdict, for Mrs.
Woolcott had a consultation next morning
with the Gaud Mayor and fixed the details
of the campaign. The girls are now being
mobilised.
The Austral Salon lights the social stove
again on August 4 with some Bard of Avon
matches. It will be the Shakspeanan
Society’s fifth meeting of the year, and the
members intend to deal with “King John.
Some of the local charities are to have a
look-in this winter. The committee of the
Women’s Hospital gave a tea-party in the
new part of the building last week, and
every guest brought some linen for the re-
stocking of the cupboards. Leading the
benevolent hundreds was the Stanley dame
with an attendant Genthelp laden like an
Indian hawker on topr.
On Saturday night there was a Children’s
Fancy Dress Ball at St. Kilda Town Hall
for the good of the Red Cross. The two
Montgomeries arranged the show, and Lesley
Madden presented the prizes. Mrs. Geoffrey
Syme’s beautiful Jane won the Champion
Cup or whatever it was. The youngster was
dressed as a bee, in a bathing gown of gold
and black stripes, with soft black velvet
wings. Many important dames sat around
the balcony and watched the show.
The Stanley children and the G.-G.’s little
Blackwood nephews were in the mob.
Kathie Prichard made one at a flying-
party the other day. It was a very small
party, the others being Premier Peacock and
his wife, Assistant-Defence-Minister Gardi-
ner and ex-Cliief Secretary Prendergast.
Everybody had a fly. most of them with
Prendy’s Son-in-law, Captain Eric Harrison.
The entertainment happened at the Central
Flying School —which is now a well-estab-
lished concern, permanently engaged in mak-
ing air-soldiers for Australia.
Sister Adelaide has had a furious week: —
Australia Day and a spell of dry weather took
most people into town on Friday, and the Australia
Day Fund had a gay time. At Tattersall’s Club
chairman S. J. Jacobs had £lOOO in the hat in 15
minutes, and the sum was handed over to purchase
votes for Mrs. R. M. Hawker, the “Queen of the
Sports,’’ putting her well in the lead, with 134,000-
odd votes. The pageant, that lasted an hour and a
half, included everything from a representation of
the pioneer ship Buffalo and the Old Gum Tree to a.
mudstain on a decorated motor-car. There was a
carnival at the Exhibition, opened by the Governor
with a characteristically brief speech. There were
sports and concerts and beggars and brigands. The
Commerical Travellers ran a Mock Court, and when
counting ceased on Friday night the street sales had
realised £3500. A matinee at the Royal on Tuesday
brought more fish to the net.
The Australia Day Fund committee, by the way,
isn’t tossing money about. Every claim is looked
into, with the result that the outgoings are still
under £4OOO a year. But we shall all be white-
haired before the last of the claims on tire funds is
paid, and the committee isn’t forgetting it.
News is through of the death of Captain Hubbe,
whose promotion was reported the other day. Aged
only 21. Mrs. A. A. Simpson is a sister of his.
An old South-Easterner died at Padtheway last
week —John Sutton. The Suttons are a big elan in
and about Mt. Gambier, and Dismal Swamp station
has been in the hands of tire family since 1841.
The naval Creswells have heard of the promotion
of son Randolph, who is with the A.I.F. He is
captain (provisional), and in command of No. 11
Camel Corps.
To an appeal from the All-British League that the
names, addresses and occupations of interned enemy
subjects should be published, the Minister of Defence
has replied “Better Not’’—for the internees, no
doubt. He has made much the -same reply to a less
reasonable suggestion from Dave Gordon, M.L.C.,
that an Australian Division should be specially
raised for service with the Russians on the eastern
Front.
There is to be no September Show. Khaki still
has possession of the Exhibition domain, and the
new grounds at Wayville are still a long way from
completion. Wet weather is hindering the work, and
the executive is not pushing things.
Ex-Premier Verran, well known as an art connois-
seur, has asked the Government to place an amount
on the estimates for paintings of M’s.P. Jackson and
O’Loughlin, who have served their time as Speakers.
Premier Vaughan has promised “earnest considera-
tion,” but as the celebrities in question are still
members of the House he doesn’t think there is
urgent need to have their images on the walls.
An appeal from Tommy Ryan that the Commer-
cial ' Travellers, Naval and Military and Democratic
Clubs should be put on the same footing as the
affluent Adelaide Club has brought a discouiaging
reply that the Government intends to put the Adel-
aide Club on the same six o'clock footing as the
others.
“Queen” entertainments have buzzed like bees.
Among them was an At Home at Mrs. T. R. Bow-
man's new house on East Terrace for the “Queen of
Sports,” and a concert —which v r as an excellent con-
cert as well as a good money-maker—for the “Queen
of the Professions.”
Norah Graham, the youngest chit of the
Frank Grahams, of Armidale, is proudly dis-
playing a ring to signify her engagement to
young Robert Godby, son of the Dean.
The sylph-like Lillies twins, Vera and
Madge, have dissolved their, spinster partner-
ship. The Vera half has become Mrs.
Matthew Drummond Blackwell in the mixed
odor of sanctity, quartered oak and well-
scrubbed floors of the Grammar ►
chapel. Matthew the bridegroom is a tall,
pale, copper-haired young man of the Mas. J
Greene type, and is part of the old-esta
lished Blackwell firm, which chiefly rabsibts
bv handling the most expensive champagne
on the Australian market. The Lillies twins
have been a noticeable pair ever since they
were angelic toddlers with snowy hair ana
frocks carved from the one piece, ri ght
through a uniform pigtailhood and an *nuis-
tinguishable “coming-out.” Papa is Dr. 1 ei-
hert Tallies, who used to have a large portion
of Tooralt on his books, and still spends a
good deal of his day on wheels.
Singer Minna Waugh just breathed the
news of her engagement to Alexander Orr
before she hurried off to Sydney to meet Ins
Maoriland boat. Now the intelligence flies
round that the marriage is over and Minna
Waugh is Minna Orr. She'll have to put
some initial after "Minna’ to make the
new surname sound Orright.
1 There is a splendid assortment of tenors
in our opera co. and only one plump and
pleasing mezzo-soprano. While the tenor on
duty is making stage love a rival top-noter
lurks gloomily at the back of the dress-circle.
Sometimes tlie off-duty man prowls along to
another vantage point to see if the stage
tableaux look any worse from that angle.
It is the sort of situation that usually ends
with a ragtime row and a grey-haired im-
presario ringing his hands and calling on tlie
saints. Jumping from the grand-opera stage
to the sawdust, a 'seasoned circus manager
once confided that he never allowed an
unmarried woman to tour in Ins companies,
save under close parental control. If an
unguarded charmer got in, the routine made
him long for death. The late Musgrove had
one bitter experience. Starting out with a
brilliantly-successful grand opera co. from
Melbourne, he had the whole jealous show
flying to pieces round his ears before he had
toured Sydney and Maoriland. A man is
safer with a truck of dynamite than a car-
riage-load of temperament.
Melbourne folk missed many performances
by one small charming Italian soprano star
(Pampari) in a co. that sang for them a few
years ago. And why? Well, Miss Soprano
was engaged seriously and matrimonially to
Mr. First Tenor. When she was billed to
appear with Mr. Second Tenor her fiance
refused to allow her to sing her part in
“Bolieme.” The lady obeyed her husband-
elect, and the furious management cancelled
her contract and put on Australian Amy
Castles. •
Melba is now taking an interest in Laurie
Kennedy, a Sydney youth who tickles a
’cello and makes it talk in its sleep.
The Town Hall could just about swallow
the concert audience that poured into it mi
Thursday night. The show was in aid of
the musicians who have lost bread-and-
butter work through the war, and the par-
ticular draw was Dolores, who sings only
for charity and patriotic purposes while the
guns are going. The rest from concert
work has enriched her voice, and she gave
delight by carolling very beautifully in a
blue-and-silver dress. Some diamonds sparkled
round her throat and a few more twinkled
among the embroidered blue roses on her
costume. She sang a scrap from “Mignon”
and some tender little ballads. A big semi-
circle of vice-regals sat in front of the radia-
tors at the foot of the platform. Lady Helen
seemed to be wearing a dress underneath her
furs, and Doris Blackwood baulked all rag-
rqcorders by drawing a ruffled pink domino-
cloak up to her chin. Stanley and his dame
had promised to he there: but the news came
through that a brother had been wounded
in France. Gaud Mayor 1 lennessy’s spec-
tacles flashed in the glare of radiators, and
John Madden sat close handy.
Melba will probably give a concert apiece
to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adel-
aide, so that a fine string of ambulances may
roll away to Russia. The Sydney concert
is now being prepared. The Melbourne
songburst will happen later and will not
clash with Melbourne’s Russian Aid Fort-
night.
The Melbourne Music- Club gave a party
to meet Yerbrugghen and his Quartet on
Thursday. First Fritz Hart talked with
his hair on end; then Yerbrugghen propped
himself comfortably in the black curve of
the. grand piano and discoursed about Art.
He wore a black velvet jacket to show that
he was an Artist and shook his iron-grey
hair when he wanted to be very impressive.
’Cellist Messeas strewed himself at the small
feet of the Great One and the Music Club
committeemen knocked their foreheads on
the floor till they almost cracked their skulls.
Two hundred Stock Exchange men took
their womenfolk to Her Majesty’s on Friday
to see “To-night’s the Night.” One of the
Bulls (or perhaps he was a Bear) had a
diamond marquise ring in his pocket for
Connie Ediss, and when it was formally pre-
sented to her she made a pretty display of
emotion. The trinket was no stranger to
her, she having pulled it off her linger and
put it up to auction after singing on ’Change
during French week. Afterwards she
remembered that a fearful lot of sentiment
had clustered round the lost gaud. The
brokers found out that her heart was break-
ing and bought the thing back for her. The
moral of the story seems to be that it is
possible to have your cake and eat it.
The Repertory Theatre is now sieklied
o’er with the very best flesh-powder, for the
white shoulders of Toorak are massed in
the front seats. The Club is shortly getting
to business again and will warm up its new
rooms in the Playhouse with a party on
August 4. The Stanley dame will be there,
and the hostesses for the occasion will bo
Mrs. John Sanderson (the shipping man’s
wife, who looks fine in the limelight), Mrs.
Malcolm Marsh, Mrs. Darbyshire and Mrs.
Welsh. The new rooms are very “cute.”
One has a platform of its own for drawing-
room concert business. There is a flavor of
mystery in a secret side staircase which is
masked by a sliding panel and reaches the
street with its finger on its lip and its heart
in its mouth. Also its boots in its hand.
Esther Paterson is crowing—yes, crow-
ing ! —over the success of her last job—
kindergarten sketches of Australian fairy
tales for school children. They are being
publisliea now in thousands and have gone
over to Sydney to the Director of Education
there. Esther’s newest job is up-to-date
illustrations of Bible stories to catch the
attention of the modern infant. I don’t
know whether Moses is to wear a belltopper
and frock coat or just plain morning dress.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“Maplisu” : While we’re on the subject it
ought to be mentioned that, according to Prof.
Lawson, of Sydney Uni., the destructive parasite on
wheat, known commonly asj “wheat-rust,” biologi-
cally as Puccinia graminis, would become quite ex-
tinct in Australia if there was no wheat produced
during one season. Seeing the enormous loss it
causes, both to the individual farmer.and the coun-
try as a whole, would it not pay to prohibit the
production of wheat for one season? This step
would, of course, mean a great temporary financial
loss, but successive harvests, free from the curse,
would be sufficiently rich to make up all lee-way.
During the sterile season we could import wheat
from, say, Maoriland (not from U.S.A., please) ;
then we could supply M.L. while she was getting
rid of the blight. [P.S. —I’ve forgotten to ask the
Prof, how long he guarantees we’d be immune after
taking his stiff dose of medicine; and I guess that’s
of some importance.]

“Harrison O.”: “Billy T.’s” account of
the chicken-fancier who set a huge artificial egg in
front of each of his hens to arouse the tribe's sport-
ing instincts and encourage them to lay up to it,
moves me to bring under notice the device of my
friend Frost. Frost conducts a suburban harem, and
has achieved remarkable results. His method of
egging-on the hens is less deserving of success than
the idealistic one employed by “Billy T.’s” fancier,
for Frost induces the birds to work overtime by
deliberately deceiving them regarding the result of
their labor. He provides each lady-bird with a box,
but in this box is a small trapdoor, so that the egg
drops through into a bassinet beneath, and the trap
closes automatically. It is rather pathetic to see a
hen looking- for the egg that it feels convinced it
has laid, and at last coming to the conclusion that
it has made a mistake and setting about to rectify
it. Frost admits that the trick is unchivalrous, but
claims that it is commercially justified since one of
his feathered odalisques has been known to lay 18
eggs at a sitting.
GROSS IGNORANCE.
FINANCLER: “Am I to understand, then, Mr. Woolley, that there is some lien on your
cattle?”
MR. WOOLLEY: “Well, I’d ha’ thought even a city bloke ’ud know they wasn’t fat all
through.”
“Nick Bottom” : “Leo Lear” (B. 13/7/’l6)
asks for Australia's smallest flying bird, and men-
tions the emu wren. We’ve got a smaller bird than
that up here on the Tweed (N.S.W.) —a tiny brown
chap that haunts the reed-beds and fox-tail brakes.
1 don’t know his proper name, but the youngsters
call him the reed bird, and he is such an unassum-
ing little fellow that I wouldn’t be surprised to
hear that it is his correct moniker. Besides being-
smaller than the ordinary reed warbler, he has this
peculiarity: his song resembles the jingle of distant
trace-chains.
* * * *
“Nick Bottom”: “Yancy” (B. 13/7/’l6)
wonders whether there is any toil more arduous or
unpleasant than lucerne pressing. My ghost, there
is. Try preparing broom millet for market. The
dust produced in heckling millet causes such a dis-
tressing itch that the man who can resist the desire
to scratch is a marvel; and scratching makes the
victim resemble Lazarus before the dogs took com-
passion on him. Add to this the fact that the
pressing of the millet entails the same amount of
labor as lucerne pressing, and the case is complete.
Apropos the amount of lucerne that constitutes a
good day’s pressing. When I was a young fellow
and the bales contained anything over 6cwt. each, six
tons per diem was nothing to cackle about; but
since coekies were compelled to make smaller bales,
the quality of the labor seems to have deteriorated
so much that six tons per day is pretty good.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: Among fodder trees carob
will take a lot of beating. It is quick-grow-
ing, provides an abundance of shade, takes nothing
from the soil and withstands either excessive drought,
or moisture. Its tremendous crop is relished by
cattle, • either when the beans are crushed or in their
natural state. A small variety is grown in Mexico
not so much for its fodder value as for the exuda-
tion, which resembles gum arabic. The cow cocky
with a few carob trees on his selection and a bit o’
lucerne in the bottom paddock could see drought to
blazes. ...

“Leo Lear”: Numerous Abo.-seribes have
risen and pelted me because I claimed a 10ft. wing-
span for our wedge-tailed eagle; many will not even
swallow an Bft. tip-to-tip measurement. Orright.
The Emu, the official organ of the Australian Orni-
thological Society, in January 14, 1914, published
the following from W. G. Roche, Melbourne: “About
two months ago I saw two large eagles near the
Werribee Gorge, and estimated their wing-spread at
10ft. The following week one of the birds was
shot by a boundary-rider. It was measured by the
land-owner, Mr. R. Hannon, and the wings went
lift, from tip to tip. Abo.-liars ought to know
that the southern Victorian eagle grows, to a bigger
bird than its northern mate, and, apropos, most of
the scoffing at our 8- to 10-footers comes from the
North. Also, the female bird is inches bigger, age
for age, than her partner in sin—a fact that is
true of nearly all the hawk and eagle order.
PEEP ABED TO REMEMBER.
ENTHUSIANSTIC FLAPPER (anxious for exact heroic details): “Have you a memory for
dates?"
RETURNED SOLDIER: “Not much! But I'll keep it in my head all right. When do you
want to meet me?”
“Athol” : I have tanned scores of opossum
and wallaby skins with brigalow bark and made them _
like chamois leather. Strip off the inside-white bark
and chop into small pieces: half-fill a kerosene tin
with bark and fill up with water ; boil for an hour.
Do your tanning in wooden or earthenware vessel
(iron or tin will make the skins black) ; tan must
be cold before putting skins in. Put in fresh tan
every second day. Take skins out every day and
scrape w r ith piece of hoop-iron sharpened ; it facili-
tates tanning, besides getting rid of superfluous flesh.
Six or eight weeks in the tan will be sufficient; peg
out in a shady place.

“C.D.”: A dog named Conrad, belonging to
R. A. Black, of Hobart, is probably the first native-
born Australian to be taken to the Antarctic for
sledging purposes. He first saw light at the Nubeena
Quarantine Station while his Eskimo parents, with
Amundsen's other clogs, were awaiting their second
journey southward with Mawson’s expedition. A
letter from A. 11. Ninnis, one of the exploration
party, was received by Black the other day. Ninnis
says Conrad “stood the cold fairly well, made a
good song about it, and kept others awake, too,” but
chiefly distinguished himself by his dexterity in
slipping his collar and his persistence in chasing
seals back into the sea at a time when fresh meat
was badly needed.
*■***■
“Petifi”: I imagine “F.H.R.” (B.
29/6/’l6) to be a mere parvenu and not born to the
manorial estate. He says he spent a comfortable
winter in his jute mansion; but did he ever try a
summer? I’ll guarantee that if he did, unless he
belongs to the salamander species, he must have been
roasted in his own juice, because his single bag cover-
ing would act under the sun’s rays like the glass roof
of a conservatory hothouse. “F.H.R.,” by the way,
calls his bag covering a “fl\ r .” It isn’t—-it’s a “roof.” '
A “fly” is a second covering, designed to fit (or fly)
over the first, and keep the latter warm or cool
according to the season. Now, I’ll tell “F.H.R.” Ifbw
to make his palace really homey. Having built his
skyscraper, as he has described, let him erect two
other forks outside the originals, about six or eight
inches higher, insert another ridge-pole, treat the
sides similarly, and over the outer frame throw
another covering of bags or calico. That is the real
“fly.” Between the two envelopes there will then be
a space of six inches or so, within which the air will
circulate, keeping the interior of the dwelling toler-
ably cool on the hottest day. On no account must
the “fly” and “roof” touch, else there’ll be leakage;
and a few light rafters under the outer skin are
useful in this connection. If bushes are handy a
“breakwind” of same along the windy side is a useful
proviso against storms. Extra cost and labor will be
infinitesimal, and “F.H.R.” will then find his mansion
as comfy as the Hotel Australia.
“Leo Lear”: You’ve been told many ways
of knowing the North when you’re in trouble, but let
me add one more. All coastal Australians know
the grass-tree, black-boy or “yacca-boy.” The
southern variety, that grows in a stout black stem
four to six feet” high, and branches into two limbs
carrying the long, grass-like leaves, has a flowering
stalk about 6ft. long. The flowers that appear
on the head of this open first, almost invariably, on
the north side. Of course, they blossom only once
a year, and a bloke might have to wait some time
to find his bearings thereby; but, judging by the
OVER THE ODDS.
FIRST B AGMAN: “ ’Ot, ain’t it, Bill!”
SECOND Do.: “’Ot! Blime, I can feel me
waterbag pantin’.”
casual way many coves treat time, work and other
useless things, they wouldn’t object to this. The
grass tree, by the way, is of the lily family, and
the flowers are a nightmare to the bee-farmer. They
contain resin, and the insects plaster the inside of
the hives with it, sometimes sealing up queen, young
and honey.

THE LAST PUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ve tippled at all your queer-named inns,
I’ve toasted Hell and the two sweet sins—•
The which two sins, as you all must learn,
Are the love you steal and the hate you earn.
I’ve guzzled from dawn until strike-me-dumb
At every grog to dead-man’s rum;
So 1 think you’ll allow that I ought to be
The ordained and anointed licensee
Of the last hotel where you all must drink
Before you get to Eternity’s brink.
The sign of my pub is “The Might Have Been” ;
Its motto, “Life’s only a dead marine.”

Offer—
MILITARY BOOTS
The boot here illustrated is one you know well by sight—the
boot worn by members of the Expeditionary Forces. We are mak-
ing them in thousands to the order of the Government, who have
an inspector to examine and pass every pair before delivery is taken.
Some pairs, when finished, fail to pass him —not for any fault that
really affects their wear or comfort, but for such minute defects as
one boot being as little as one-eighth of an inch higher at the back
than the other; one slug being out of place; or the heel not being
sufficiently even to pass the spirit-level test.
Nothing else is wrong with the rejects.
They’re SOLID LEATHER THROUGHOUT,
are built to withstand the toughest usage, to
give the MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COM-
FORT TO THE WEARER, and are GUAR-
ANTEED to do so.
WRITE NOW FOR A PAIR. They’re
ideal for country and other hard wear, and
for the money—l4/6, carriage paid—are

“Adelaide” : Talking of odd deaths, a cat,
of all unlikely animals, must have made a false
shot at my suburban garden-fence the other night,
and, missing, got caught by the neck between the
pickets. In the morning there it hung, quite dead,
opposite my front door. I had just come back from
a kangaroo-drive, in the course of which I helped to
kill 20 or 30, and took a hand in the skinning of
most of them. But somehow that gory scene did not
affect me as the sight of that hanging corpse did.
Slow strangulation is such a stuffy death.
* * * *
“Karaji” : “Devilfish” is wrong in saying
that no one knows anything definite about the King
Island emu. The birds were dwarf emus, little
bigger than our bustard and slightly smaller than
the extinct Kangaroo Island emu. The King Island
bird is described in Peron’s narrative of his voyage
to Australia. Latham (1823) states that he saw
two specimens in a London exhibition. Three of the
Kangaroo Island emus lived for about 20 years in
the Jardin des Plantes. The skeletons of two are
in the Paris Museum and the remains of the third
in the Florence Museum. The Tasmanian species
differed little from our own, and only in 1904, 52
years after its last recorded appearance, was it
accepted as distinct.
* * * *
“Merrigal”: If anybody happens into an
Outback shanty when the king drovers are the topic,
put in a chip for old Jim Underwood, of Mudgee
(N.S.W.). With his eight sons and kit he left
Brunette Downs,, beyond Camooweal (Q.), with
4000 head of cattle for Grahway, Lower Macquarie.
Prior to reaching the Rankin, where less than a
dozen head suicided by overdrinking, and where he
spelled six months because of shortage of fee(l and
water ahead, he encompassed a 70 miles’ waterless
stretch over which the maddened longtails were
strung at times over great distances on the lookout
for drink. Eventually the crowd got to Brewarrina
(N.S.W.), where a cut of 200 was trucked to
Flemington to average £ll 10s. The balance were
delivered tip-top. A year and 10 months were ticked
off between start and finish.
♦** * *
“E.S.S.”: When the rich scrub timbers
were first tapped on the Hastings and Manning
(N.S.W.) the pioneers built their own boats, cutting
the material in the scrubs with pitsaws and in the
dense forests with axes and crosscuts. When a
dreadnought was loaded with timber the bushmen,
leaving a couple of hands in charge of the camps,
sailed away to Sydney. Rarely did one of the crew
know much about navigation, but they managed to
make the voyage without serious mishap. This was
all the more remarkable since few of them were
unduly sober on the homeward voyage, rum being
most liberally served out. Wild and weird were the
doings in camp after the return of the ship. Drink-
ing, dancing and music made a week merry. Some-
times the company of a few of the semi-wild blacks
of the neighborhood made the revels more boisterous
still. When the jamboree was ended it was a sore-
headed party that shouldered axes and saws, and set
about cutting another cargo for the waiting vessels.
Pelican, on the Manning, was an important place in
1851, for Captain Alex. Newton had established ship-
building yards there, and many a schooner, brig and
barque was launched from his stocks. Those were
rough days for the settlers. Theirs was all scrub-
land, which, after being cleared and burnt off, was
planted with a hoe. Flour was often 30s. a cwt.
UNDER COVER.
BILL: “My oath, Jim, I wish we had our
old periscope here!”
and maize meal was largely used instead. A substi-
tute for tea was made of burnt corn, ground to
powder and sweetened with honey. When ripe the
corncobs were humped in bags over the charred
logs, then threshed with flails, sieved, bagged and
drawn per slide and a couple of bullocks to the river
bank, whence, in many places, the bags were
carried through mud and water waist-deep or more
to reach the vessel. And when the crop was finally
delivered in Sydney the growers got about 15d. a
bushel for it.
THE MARCH OF PROGRESS.
BUTCHER: “I couldn’t get yer that there lamb y’ ordered, mum — lamb’s very scarce.”
MUM: “How do you account for that, Mr. Sheepshanks?”
BUTCHER (darkly): “The sheep is gettin’ too cunning, mum.”
“Quidam”: The faculty of being able to
accommodate oneself to circumstances is a good
thing in the bush parson, but in practice it may
be carried too far. Our back-o’-the-Blue Mountains
(N.S.W.) pilot had been officiating at a funeral,
and decided, in the absence of convenient train
arrangements, to return by the hearse. Presently,
the day being cold and wet, and the parson deli-
cate, he got the undertaker to let him crawl inside
the vehicle. From the point of comfort the idea
worked splendidly, but the sight of the tall, gaunt
individual sitting behind the plate glass of the
conveyance caused undue shock to several members
of his congregation.
“F.Z.E.”: In Bulletin of July 6
“A.A.8.” stated that Dr. Leach, of the Victorian
Education Department, asserts that there is no
authentic record of a wedge-tailed eagle having
shown a larger wing spread than 7ft. On the desk
before me is a specimen, shot at Toorbul Point,
Queensland, a few months ago, and this eagle has
a wing spread of Bft. 3in. Don’t know whether
this is an authentic wing spread or not, but that
is the distance between the two tips when the wings
are fully spread without stretching.
“D'Entrecasteaux” : Talking of sharks and
suicides “Ngatik” (B. l/6/’l6) favors Satowan
Lagoon (Central Pacific), but let me advise him to
try Sanaroa Passage, near Ferguson Island, which
has more sharks to the acre than any other strait
in the D’Entrecasteaux Group. However, the San-
aroa man who feels unable to live any longer in
sloth and an uncertainty of food prefers a much
more unpleasant form of death than that provided
by the teeth of the man-eaters. His favorite plan
is self-hypnotism: just saying that he is going to
die, he turns his back on the world and passes out
in a few days. When a man wants to annoy his
enemies he goes to their house and pegs out there,
which makes them build another house to get away
from the spirit of deceased. The spirit is supposed
to be hostile to those its owner hated while alive.
All sorts of calamities are due to a dead enemy’s
spirit—a bad crop of yams, non-success in fishing,
a nagging wife, too many female children, and
ulcerated legs—and only by many pigs and various
other wealth paid to the village sorcerer can such
evils be prevented. Until civilisation arrived with
its magistrates, handcuffs and gaols, the sorcerer
amassed much wealth, and even now the old fashions
flourish in secret like the morals of society amongst
ourselves.
“Billy T.” : Tbe Only Hope was situated
in an almost inaccessible place in the Buffalo dis-
trict (Vic.), and catered for its own men.- They
were housed in a long, barrack-like shed which was
bedroom, kitchen arid living-room. One wall was
given over to bunks, which were ranged, one above
the other, like shelves in a shop. The scheme
worked well till Bill Hoskin was given a braceman’s
billet. Bill was bulkier than any miner had a right
to be, and was given a job on top because it was an
impossibility for him to go below. As a late-comer
he was compelled to bunk aloft, and the effect of his
arrival on the apex of the frail structure was not
lost upon the other lodgers. But nothing serious
happened till one Sunday night when the wall came
down with a crash. There were about 20 miners
among the ruins, mostly nightshift men due below at
one. They arose from the ruins miraculously un-
harmed, and a cloud of blasphemy went up with the
dust. But Hoskin merely poked his head out from
a tumble of bedclothes. “Oh, well,” he said, “it
was d n well time to get up, anyway!”
* * * *
“Alamon” : What is the greatest number of
pups a kangaroo bitch has had at once? The N.T.
knows of mammas having 12 in the one litter. Have
heard of 17, but my informant was a teetotaller
with a squint.
“Big Tarwin”: When Wonthaggi was a
canvas town you could get drunk at “The Blue Pig,’ :
“The Green Pig,’’ “The Blazing Stump’’ or “The
Sudden Jerk.” They were all situated two miles
from the town, but I never could walk the distance
coming home under two hours.
“Yarrum”: The grittiest Australian
woman I ever knew was the wife of one McCabe,
and she lived at Mulloon, near Bungendore (N.S.W.),
where the husband shepherded for Bill Scott. One
day when I was eating with the Scott family, Mrs.
McCabe, who had been bedridden for years, came
into the room on her hands and knees and with her
tongue hanging out. It was the hottest day I can
remember. She had crawled two miles, over burning
stones and rough country, to say that her man
had been bitten by a black snake; and for God’s
sake to hurry. He succumbed, and the brave widow
went to Heaven three weeks later.
“Hay” : In good seasons iii Centralia miles
and miles of wild barley may be seen waving in the
breeze in the soft places, called “rotten ground.”
L’he seed resembles pearl barley, only it is smaller
and darker. This grain is the “nardoo” or “yaleha-
baba” from which Binghi used to prepare his flour
by a very tedious process. The mill was a very
primitive affair. The nether half was a flat piece
of sandstone 18 inches across, with a hollowed centre,
in which the upper stone turned round on top of
the seed till it was reduced, husks and all, to a
rough, dark meal. When this was mixed with
waiter it was baked in the ashes like a damper. The
result was a gluey cake which didn’t seem to me
to be worth the trouble involved in its production.
I saw several of these mills on a sandhill just West
o’ Darling (N.S.W.) not long ago. The small pic-
caninny or “burloo” was fed with a mixture of the
meal and cold water. The finding of suitable food
for the young ones seemed to be an ever-present
problem for Mrs. Binghi, and it was only after good
rains that such luxuries as porridge meal and green
food were to be had.
* * * *
“Taurua”: Can any Abo.-reader tell me
of a safe, reliable method (other than disposing of
the beast) of preventing a bull from rambling? I
have heard that if you suspend the lid of a camp-
oven from the horns you can keep his Maj. from
breaking through fences; but in the case of this
fellow the offence is swimming a river in search of
lady bovines on a neighboring run and neglecting his \
job at home.
* * * *
“F.H.R.”: Let all hands knock off and go
and have a look at the authenticated measurements
and photos of a blue-gum which was felled in the
Huon district (Tas.). They are in Hobart Museum.
The bole was 12ft. high lying on the ground, and
if I remember rightly £250 worth of timber was
cut out of it.
* * * *
“Nor-West”: Remember the “Pig and
Tinder Box,” of early days, that was located on the
banks of the historic Mooki River, near Breeza,
Liverpool Plains (N.S.W.), or “Braza,” as the late
Edward Butler, barrister, in a famous trial in the
early ’7o’s, called it, to the bewilderment of an
aboriginal witness whom he was examining? The
pub was run by some of the Conroy clan, who were
well-known identities in those times, and was the
first coach stage across Liverpool Plains, what time
Bob Nowlands’s lightning express used to cater for
mails and passengers along the North-West. In a
wet winter I’ve seen said express with a team of
draught horses hitched on to the coach team take
nine hours to do six miles, Now we snort if the
train is 10 minutes late.
TWO OF A SORT.
RUSTY: “It’s no go, Bill! I worded the old
girl, and I sags, ‘I’m ’ungry; very
’angry, mum!’”
BLISSFUL BILL: “Well, wot ’appened?”
RUSTY: “She says, "Ungry, are yer — well.
so’s me dawg!’”
“W.T.H.”: In Cuba, where the ant pest
is prevalent, I found the following to be a certain
protection: Dissolve some corrosive sublimate (mer-
curic chloride) in alcohol or met. spirit, then take a
fine-haired brush and paint a streak, say 2in. wide,
around the legs of the safe, or even on a cement
floor. Give about three coats and the ants will
never cross that line.
HE DRINKS LIKE A FISH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He drinks like a fish and enjoys it, too ;
His nose is bright purple with hints of blue;
And Life trails by with a wink and a swish,
For he is a sport and drinks like a fish.
He drinks like a fish, so his meals are few;
He has grown to hate things he has to chew;
It s quicker to drink than feed from a dish,
So he says “Here’s luck!” and drinks like a fish.
I never could drink like a gay old fish!
My head was intended for lemon squish;
So I don’t approve of the way he drinks
And scowl at Life’s scandalous nods and winks.
He drinks like a fish; but no fish could stand
The stagger he raises with his right hand;
If a shark could walk with him round the town
It’s morally certain that shark would drown.
Some say that it’s silly. I do not think
There’s anything silly in good strong drink;
If Life would pass with a wink and a swish,
I’d drinl: like a fish! I’d drink like a fish!

N this room the fermenting- and skimming of the New
Light Crystal Ale takes place. The Fermenting
Rounds will be seen on either side of the illustration,
toward the top. Two are also shown at the end. Both these
and the Skimming Tanks are made of seasoned Kauri, and
thoroughly covered with Shellac to prevent the contamination of
the New Light Crystal Ale. Each of the Fermenting
Rounds holds about 102 barrels and the Skimming Tanks
65 barrels.
Take a bottle home to-night.

This co.’s old trouble is still with it. it
f a “- t o. et labor. When the war started and
the German possessions thereabouts were
collared the co. thought that it was the
nartv to whom the ill wind might blow
some good. But alas! “The hope that an
early solution might be found in the engage-
nmnt of labor from the late posses-
sions has not yet been realised... .No leliet
in this direction can be expected till attei
the termination of the war Meantime
planters must just carry on as best they can
with such local labor as may be obtainable.
The white man who wants to do things m a
hurry claims that the Solomon Is ander is
slowly dying out, and that if the local
native is relied upon the islands will fall
further and further behind as the inhabi-
tants disappear. But the view of tle
Papuan Administration is that the I apuan,
having accommodated himself to new con-
ditions, is now increasing in numbers, after
threatening for a while to disappear; and
a similar turn of the tide is predicted foi
the Solomons. The Maoriland experience
supports the theory.
Meantime however, cos. like this one,
anxious to get ahead, are having a weary
time. With 50.000 acres to cultivate (most
of it held on 999-year lease), the co. thus
far has only 3654 acres under crop, and no
new work is being attempted. . It has just
as much as it can do to keep the piesent
plantations free from weeds. The label
roll shows a little improvement during the
year; but the figures are still very small.
This is how they have moved: 1911, 464,
073 . 1913 328 ; 1914, 809; 1910, 206,
1916. 315’ The bulk of the cropped area
is under cocoa nuts, and as the market is
disturbed “produce to the total of 1481.)
remains on hand.” Because the value of
this produce lias to be estimated, and
because it is almost impossible to stiicto
separate money spent on production from
that spent on development (the lattei
debited to capital), the profit for the year
is little more than assumption. The co. has
also about 200 acres under rubber hast
year a trifle was harvested; from this out
there should be some revenue from this
source, especially as the Papuan at any
rate, lias been found quite a good band at
tapping. The co.’s 1000 shares arc now all
paid to £65. On March 31 total liabilities
W ere £6595; and cash, book debts and pio
dime on hand total £5053. The co.’s finances
are thus not brilliant; but apparently it
hopes to pull through for a while without
making more calls. All the same, it n<
doubt wishes it couldn’t. And it couldnt.
of course, if there was labor available to
develop some of the unused 46,000 acres.

The accounts might be made more nitelh-
o-ible In the first place it complicates mat
ters to bring the total depreciation reserve
into Profit and Loss each term. It would
simplify them if the only entries there were
the amounts added to and written off the
depreciation fund. And the directors repoit
should be made to conform to the accounts
or vice Verna. Actually the report alleges
“a balance of £2144 now available for distri-
bution,” the interim div. having been on turn
reckoning paid out of the current year s
earnings, whereas the accounts show it paid
out of old accumulations.
This co. was formerly heavily loaded with
overvalued or unproductive properties,
acquired in the late ’Bo’s, when there was a
previous borrowing boom. The collapse
came in the early ’9o’s, and Alien this co.
had 10 years either of no dividends at all 01
of dividends so small that they merely
reminded the shareholders of how hungry
they were. The next table shows how things
have altered :—■

The properties on hand have been gradually
got rid of; and not only that money but a
good deal besides lias been put into new
advances. In the last couple of years just
£lO,OOO has been added to the amount out-
standing; and the greater part of it has
had to be raised by overdraft. It seems a
most expensive method of finance. In a
general way, no doubt, Newcastle has a
great future before it; but even Newcastle
property values will probably show a big
fall presently. Still, it is possible to make
tolerably safe advances; all depends on the
margin of value in excess of the advance
and the letting quality of the security. So it
may be all good business. What the investor
is also entitled to take note of is that there
is a good deal of risk about it, just as there
was in the late ’SO’s.
The Inky Way.
At a Melbourne suburban social to the
honor and glory of a conspicuous local
Hebrew, one jubilant speaker the other
evening felt called upon to describe Mi.
Mosesstein’s two daughters as “bis superb
Junos.” And then a local weekly fell into
u natural nut most pathetic error. It
reported the phrase as “his superb Jen
nose!”
The* war has indeed upset the world.
London Punch said “Damn” the other day.
Not “D —n” or “D—m —but ‘ Damn.

Old newspaper men continue To gather
promotion in South Aus. The local f
siii'uvtcf Review complains bitteiiy o.
IKck, who left the Adelaide ADmmsr*
nine years ago to lead the (government Re
porting Staff, being given the new-made office
of Premier’s Secretary. He lias become
senior to men with four and five times Ins
length of service. Are we to suppose that
all his seniors are inferior to him in train-
ing ability and general worth .' 1 bincock
has lately' been secretary to the Railways
Standing Committee, and that place will be
filled by Cockburn, who left the Register
three years ago to go on Hansard staff.
Fred Johns, Australia’s biographer-general,
also ex-REGiSTEK, remains as chief of the
Hansard men.
The Northern Star (N.S.W.) has dis-
covered the secret of the wonderful new
Russian offensive. The congregation will
please take the news standing.
The Russians first crossed the Stokhod north and
south of its sharp apex at Ugli, compelling the
Mr. Hughes’s counsel and inspiration confia o ratin o
villages reddening the sky for miles.
Now we know why lie set the Thames on lire
—he was only practising.
* * *
“G.”: Peace to the ashes of Captain O. K.
Johnston, buried' somewhere in France. When
on the staff of Wellington (M.L.) Dominion
he brightened up all hands by coming to work
with his own car and chauffeur, and the
solemn majesty of his trips to report the
Miramar Borough Council meetings was a
new feature in daily journalism. The splen-
did habit is likely to die with him, although
it never interfered with the sound work he
put into his commonplace job. He was a son
of C. J. Johnston, Speaker of M.L. s House
of Landlords.
* * * *
“Gosh”: Charles G. Ross, who has just
begun a 12 months’ engagement with Mel-
bourne Herald, is Associate-Professor of
Journalism at Missouri (U.S.A.) _ Univer-
sity, but doesn’t care about advertising the
fact. He told the Herald staff when it
assembled to welcome him the other day that
he had come all the way from America to
dodge the title. Also, he lias come to
absorb Australian* journalistic methods,
although so far he has not attended R. A.
Sweetland’s lecture on “How a great news-
paper is produced.” If he has any bright
American ideas about his clothes the
Herald directorate has announced its inten-
tion of grabbing them. The staff-men are
waiting to see how the par anent the corpse
and the room where the murder was per-
formed (marked with an X) would he
dressed at Missouri. Ross is an unassuming
fellow with considerable nasal accent, and
he affects the same sort of hat that has made
another Yankee famous in Commonwealth,
politics. According to editor Jack Davnt-
son, who took him to see Clabby and Hol-
land bruise each other at Melbourne
Stadium, he is a sport. After the scrap,
the Professor and the pugs spent an exhilar-
ating half-hour in fistic gossip. The 1 rot-
held his end up, too, when it came to talking
the language of the country—the language
which starts with “Gee 1” and ends with
“dallar.” #
“D.” : Arthur Lavis, who holds the Aus-
tralian record for length of time on Govern-
ment Office rounds —16 years continuously—
has shifted into the news editor’s chair ot
Brisbane Courier. During his long innings
at the old job he saw seven Governments
come and go, to say nothing of the numerous
reconstructions. There was not a Premier
amongst the lot whose confidence Lavis did
not hold. Which is a big thing to say.
r. J. L. Chevassus, for years an ornament
of the M.L. Inky Way, stopped a lump ot
lead in France recently, but was able to
rejoin his regiment in a few days. lor
several years he was on The Press, ot
Christchurch. Then he dodged about the
Auckland province, afterwards steered the
Wairarapa Daily Times, and when he
heard the Great Call was in Hokitika as
editor of the West Coast Times. He is
of French extraction and knows a string ot
languages, including German, and can t talk
for two minutes on any subject without
dragging in the Napoleonic wars by the lian
of Waterloo. # #
“Nemo” : Apropos the rise in the price of
the Hobart papers from Id. to l|d. A
generation ago, when the Argus cost 3d. a
day, the newsvendors had a set of clients
who borrowed the paper for Id. an hour, and
thus saved a bob a week. I remember when
I was a boy in the Cold Country the news-
vendors at street corners made a good thing
out of lending papers to people who came up
and had a 10-minutes read^f or Id.
“Trooper Bluegum”: AYas glad to see
in a recent Bulletin the remarks of
“Copabella” re Australian poets. It is
extraordinary what a place Gordon holds
in the minds of English folk. Scores of
well-educated people have asked me about
Australian writers, and while all have
mentioned Gordon, most of them had never
heard of Kendall, Ogilvie, Lawson, Brunton
Stephens, Essex Evans, Quinn, Paterson,
Boake or Dennis. All the English girls
know Ella AVlieeler AVilcox, but they have
not heard —yet —of Nina Murdoch or Doro-
thea Mackellar. Incidentally, all the Anzacs
are madly in love with Doreen and think
The Sentimental Bloke is just great. If
you start a plebiscite to pick the Australian
poet laureate we’ll all plump for Ginger
Mick’s Cobber.
* Mr * *
“D.F.”: Most reporters haven’t much
commercial instinct, but one who toiled on
an up-country newspaper in N. S. AVales
had either that or luck. His salary wasn t
big, but it had piled up, and the boss told
him lie would have to take it out in pigs or
maize, whichever he liked. He went nap on
maize, then 3s. per bushel, held it tor a
week or two, and cleared 4s. But it
was a poor reward to the proprietors for
their promptness in paying before the rise.
“J.F.11.”: The fifty-third anniversary
dinner of the Newspaper Press Fund has
just been consumed under the presidency oi:
the Earl of Derby, with Billy Hughes as
one of the principal guests. A collection at
the close of the oratory added £2 <OO to the
fund for superannuated sub-editors and
reporters. Billy, responding to the toast ot
“The Ausitors,”' said they had a very good
press in Australia and its tone was beyond
reproach. In the course of a somewhat
varied career he had'plunged into tlie mael-
strom of journalism himself. AA ith some
other hopeful persons in the early stages ot
his political life he had—but I suppose
you’ve heard that story before.
THE DRIVEL OF THE DAMNED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They put it in their papers now, but when the pulp
And 1 Judgment Day is come at last, oh, then we’ll
For journalists with weary eyes and pens quite diy
Will°take their scraps of writing- gear and into
The shining streets of Paradise, where Murder never
Will^offei^'naug'ht to anyone whom whisp’ring Rumor
No angel sues for a divorce and politics fall dead
Where lamb’s-wool clouds and singing-birds duft
past old Peter’s head.
So journalists must go to Hell, and Satan s door-
bell ring, ' , , , .
To write a paper for the damned and make hot
presses sing.
Old Nick will see their torments fit. The devil-
comps. will be . ,
Far worse than any human comp, who ever worried
me ,* ,
Hot writs will fall upon their heads, and censors
rude and rash ~
Will rip their rounded periods and make ot a
things hash;
The false-alarmist will infest their stuffy little ce .
And spin them lies of scandals rich in other distant
he lls •
The devil-bore with hours to kill will kill them
slowly there,
Wiping his loathly hoofs upon the red-hot office
-chair. . . .
The drivel that the papers print upon this cool
green earth
Will not compare with what they’ll brew to wake
the Devil’s mirth!
So down in darkest Hades when the private hells are
slammed, ’
We’ll read in coaly corridors the drivel ot the
damned—
The drivel that the torments baked from ev ry
wretch’s soul
Will be recorded day by day in our accursed hole,
And each will read other’s yells, and every
inmost thought,
And dash Asbestos Jottings down and stamp around
and snort.
It will be hell for journalists, and all with eyes to
read,
When Nick, the black Arch-Editor, of hatred sows
the seed!
My clattering hoofs will scrape the floor when, into
Sheol crammed,
I come wide-eyed to help them with the drivel of the
damned.

KODAK.
KING OF THE WORLD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
King of the whole blue World am I,
Not a slave of ink and nibs!
The shouting wind goes roaring by,
And I kick it in the ribs;
I kick the wild wind in the ribs,
And I smack the sounding sea!
I am no slave of ink and nibs!
The King of the World —that’s me!
I fly above, I swim beneath,
And I boss the gull and shark;
I bid the cyclone clean its teeth,
And the gale says I’m a nark ;
1 rush the snowy clouds along-,
And the frost and rain I fix ;
If Winter pipes too loud a song,
Then I fine it four-and-six.
I owe no cash—l pay no bills !
Not a raging grocer calls,
For all the world my thunder fills
As my primal vengeance falls
On small, cheap men who rage for cash
In a small and humble way ;
Wild grocers with one lightning flash
I burn up every day.
My pants are neither worn nor bagged
In that sad, poetic style;
My brain’s all right, my heart’s not sagged,
And I know not spite or guile;
Small worries squash beneath my feet
As upon my way I’m hurled,
And angels mutter: “Ain’t he sweet!”
When I stride across the world.
The lightning plays about my door,
The hurricane sweeps my yard;
The wildest gale for one-and-four
Will scrub for me good and hard ;
I pay the wind, I pay the sea,
And I fee the empty sky;
The sun grows red at sight of me.
The Boss of the World am I !
N.s.w.
THE RELIGIOUS EDITOR.

Human Nature as it exists. Here are answered, in plain lan-
guage, a thousand questions that occur to the minds of young
and old, but about which they feel a delicacy in consulting
their physician. Chapters are devoted to innumerable inter-
esting subjects concerning marriage, which makes it a very
superior guide to the action of men and women both in and
out of marriage. No man or woman who anticipates a bright
future, and wishes to enjoy married life in its fullest sense,

needless drudgery in keeping the home

Ideal Boilers

make every nook and corner of the home
genially cosy and require no more care-
taking than to run a stove for one room.
They are equally suitable for any build-

The Radiators come in many handsome designs, and are
greatly admired. They are fed from pipes connecting
with an Ideal Boiler, and can be placed in cold, draughty;

GROSS, FEVERISH, BILIOUS CHILDREN
NEED CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
Look, Mother! See if the tongue is
coated; this denotes sluggish
liver and bowels.
Mother! You’re child isn’t naturally cross
and peevish. See if the tongue is coated;
this is a sure sign that its little stomach,
liver and bowels need attention at once.
When listless, pale, feverish, “stuffy” with
cold, throat sore; when the child has tainted
breath and doesn’t eat, sleep or act naturally
or has stomach-ache or diarrhoea, remember,
a gentle liver and bowel cleansing should
always be the first treatment given.
Nothing equals California Syrup of Figs
—“Caliiig”—for children’s ills; give a tea-
spoonful, and in a few hours all the waste
matter, sour bile and fermenting food clogged
in the bowels pass out of the system, and
you have a healthy and playful child again.
All children love this harmless, delicious
fruit laxative, and it never fails to effect a
good “inside cleansing.” Directions for
babies, children of all ages and grown-ups
are plainly on the*bottld.
Keep it handy in your home. A little
given to-day saves a side child to-morrow,
but get the genuine. Ask your chemist for
a bottle of “Califig”—California Syrup of
Figs—then look and see that it is made by
the California Fig Syrup Company. Refuse
substitutes. All chemists sell “Califig”—
California Syrup of Figs—in bottles of two
sizes, Is. IH. and Is. 9d. [4
POLITICAL
POINTS
No one can accuse Defence Minister Pearce
of being inattentive to detail, even in small
things. He issued a proclamation the other
day pronouncing Epsom salts and castor oil
to be necessary commodities, and immediately
included matches and candles. Pearce
always thinks twice.
THE BIRD FANCIER.
A hint, said to have been inspired by Bethmanri-
Hollweg, has come from Germany that she would
accept reduced peace terms. — Cable.
BILL POTSDAM: “Madam, can I do business
mit you?”
On Hughes’s return his proper place is at
the Defence Department. There is far more
important work to be done there than in
the Attorney-General’s office, which, any-
way, is blessed with a permanent head of
most exceptional quality. Besides, while
his travels haven’t made the Prime Minister
of much if any greater value as an Attorney-
General, they should have made him an
invaluable Defence Minister. It is the post
of greatest importance; it is the one where
most of the organising that really matters
and most also of the spending has to be
done; it is the job which, has been given
to the man who is most like Hughes in British
politics; and it is the one which has become
the 'most completely enveloped in red tape
here. The big question immediately ahead
is the question of universal service. Pearce
says that not another man could have been
thrust into the field if we had had universal
service; and Hughes ought to put himself
at the head of the department which makes
such an appalling confession. Plainly it
wants waking up.
THE BIG BRITISH ADFANCE.
(The dream of every Australian politician.)
Con Hogan, one of the officials of the Rail-
way Workers’ Union, will tackle the elusive
Goulburn electorate this time. For years
this seat has been reckoned as likely to be
won by Labor, but Liberalism still holds it.
McGarry was to have
wooed the district at the
election in which he was
returned for Murrumbid-
gee; but the executive of
the P.L.L. considered it
foolish to throw away
chances by baiting the
hook with a rather raw
speaker, so Hector
Larnond was sent to the
front, and McGarry was
shoved along to the sup-
posedly hopeless ’bidgee.
All concerned still won-
der what struck them.
Kink O’Malley, who
deserts his Christian
brother in Australia to
give a job to somebody in
America, must be annoyed
over the opinion of the
official sent to the
United States to take
over the railway carriages
which the Kink wouldn’t
trust Australians to build.
His officer’s opinion is
that, in spite of all the
wonders of America at
work, the Australian is
still on top for “energy
and intelligence.” Such
being the case, and tim-
ber of the most suitable
kind being available
within the Common-
wealth, O’Malley’s Ameri-
can purchases are in the
nature of a swindle.
While the best workman-
ship and material are in
our own land, the Minis-
ter who goes abroad to
obtain them is cheating his own workers out
of a job and the public out of its cash.
Exit Happy Jack Scaddan, the Labor
Premier who lias spent four and a half
riotous years ifi putting Westralia into
pawn. This paper has a good deal of sym-
pathy for John. He didn’t get a fair deal.
But it wasn’t bis opponents who didn't give
it to him: it was some of bis so-called
supporters. On the plea—-not a bad one —
that the middleman and some of the manu-
facturers (foreign mostly) were rooking the
producer and making the cost of living un-
bearable, John put the borrowed money into
ships and butchers’ shops and farm-
implement works and a dozen other desirable
things. If then John had been able to com-
mand good management and the services of
workmen who were resolved to make the
State business a success, he would have been
Westralia’s Bigger John. But good man-
agement is one of the hardest things in the
world to command, and, moreover, John
made his experiments just when labor was
casing down on everything but its demand
for more pay; so John’s State enterprises
were mostly a failure and sometimes a
ghastly failure. Therefore John goes out,
defeated not by Wilson, who succeeds him,
but chiefly by his own supporters and their
rotten idea of what State enterprise is for.
Opposition-Leader C. G. Wade (N.S.W.)
was at Ipswich the other day and remarked
in impressive tones that if he “de-
pended on newspapers for his information
about Queensland liis mind would be a
blank.” It is to be feared that Mr. Wade
has depended on the newspapers for nearly
everything.
“Copy Boy” : The par. (B.
13/7/’l6) anent the bill for £Bll6
for free passes on the Vic. Rail-
ways (which is in addition to the
£5OOO a year allowed for carrying
M’s.P.) recalls how the evil
flourished in the boom. In 1808
the Age published a list of free
passes issued between 1884 and
1892 to members of the Vic. Legis-
lature and their friends, and the
catalogue occupied 114 columns.
Hater a list of passes issued to
“distinguished visitors and others”
filled 20 columns. An official re-
turn showed that in eight years
221 were issued to Commissioner
Speight’s household, 118 to Com-
missioner Ford’s and 90 to Com-
missioner Greene’s. Many of
these, too, were made out not for
individuals* but for groups, such as
“Ford, Mrs., and three daughters.”
It is unlikely that the evil is as
bad to-day as it was 30 years ago,
but the Victorian Government and
the Railway Commissioners have
evinced a resolute determination
not to publish a return regarding
the matter.
When William Holman has time to spare
from his many relaxations he might, as a
Laborite pledged to the White Australia
policy, ask his officers what they mean by
rejecting a tender from the Cumberland
Paper Board Mills for cardboard for railway-
tickets, and patronising the black-labor fac-
tories of India. And in case Holman and
his very patriotic Railway Minister Hoyle
hide behind the Commissioners, the latter
might explain whether they think the best
way to encourage N. S. Wales railway traf-
fic is to get as many people as possible to
live -somewhere else.
FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT.
DOMAIN A NARCHIST: “Look at that, sir,
breaking up a milk-and-watery meeting
like that, an’ I’ve been givin' it to ’em
red ’ot and strong for near twenty
years every Sunday! Did they ever
break me up? No, sir! There's grati-
tude for you!”
Though he ofteli talks about it, Pearce
doesn’t know any better than the next person
whether, under conscription, more men
could have been sent to the Front than have
been sent under the haphazard, unscientific,
wasteful voluntary system ; and he is a less
impartial judge than the next man in the
THE MACQUARIE HOTEL.
What sort of a spectacle would be presented if it
became known that, while the public-house floor
was closed at six o’clock, an ingenious and thirsty
constituent with influential friends at the House
could stroll up there and obtain liquor with the
indulgence of the member for his district?

matter. But that is not the point, anyway.
The Commonwealth has got to pay for this
war. By making' an appeal to the patriot-
ism of the people the Government might
probably raise as much as the income tax
will bring in year by year. Will Pearce
plead, therefore, that an appeal for volun-
tary contributions is as good and proper a
thing as the income tax?
As a result of what happened ii’i the
Assembly last week it seems certain that
next general election will see a political
revolution in N. S. Wales. For some time
past there have, as a rule, been only ■ two
candidates for each seat. But it was
announced that, striking an average, each
member has to spend only 4Ad. per week at
the bar in Parliament House to get all he
wants; and if that doesn’t break down all
the laws of party warfare and cause a rush
of candidates to the poll, nothing will.
The pronouncement of N.S.W. Speaker
Meagher that the Liquor Referendum Act
doesn’t apply to the Parliamentary refresh-
ment bar may be good law, but the Holman
crowd hasn’t so many friends that it can
afford to lose a lot through a prominent
member like Meagher claiming that the legis-
lator is privileged above the common citizen.
Evidently Meagher worked up his “case”
with some assiduity; but it was when he
began to hit words off his own bat that he
was really interesting :
Members are paid to come here at 4.30 p.m. to
transact the business of the State, and there is no
reason why, if any member should feel desirous of
having a whisky and soda, he should be debarred.
One of the reasons why the people were
asked to close the pubs at 6 o’clock was that
the late whisky was “spoiling efficiency.”
According to Meagher, grog doesn’t spoil the
M.P.’s efficiency; in fact, without grog he
isn’t “efficient” enough to do his work. The
navvy’s or the wharfy’s poison is the legis-
lator’s meat, it seems.
THE SUPERMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The New York Times, in an article headed “Two
Years of the Superman,” contains a sweeping con-
demnation of German methods, and concludes: “To-
day the empire of frightfulness has been surrounded
and beleaguered, with no longer any chance to
resume the offensive.”- — Cable.
The superman went forth to slay,
• lie raised the sword and trained the gun ;
■ His mighty legions in the fray
Cheered for a hundred battles won.
His kultur on the world to press,
He set his teeth and squared his jaw,
And, ’neath his flag of Frightfulness,
He laughed at decency and law.
Across the fields of little days
Men watched his march with shame and fear.
His murders filled them with amaze,
They shuddered of his crimes to hoar.
Till, beaten back, but strong in will,
Truth and the Faith-in-tliings-to-be
Arose in might the storm to still
And smite the monster to his knee.
But still the superman was seen
Behind his walls of flaming steel,
An awful shape that seemed to lean
Through the black smoke of war’s appeal
With menace of more awful things.
The lightning flaming from the gun,
The death that soared on aerial wings
Marked but a phase of pain begun.
lie seemed to conquer ; but the strength
Of Truth was linked to Time’s strong car.
The human legions rose at length
In power no superman could mar.
The world’s stage changed. Men saw aright
Where the true strength of nations lay—
The Teuton in his dull, dazed flight;
The rising world at battle play.
N.S.W.
CURSE O’ MOSES.
THE HAPPY ENDING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I would lead you into battle,”
Said the Kaiser to his horde,
“Where you die like driven cattle;
But my mission from the Lord
Keeps me far from any killing.
I’ve a quiet, kingly job
While your common graves you’re filling
As an ether-maddened mob.”
“I would be a super-hero,”
Said the Kaiser to his gang,
l’ve got to be a Nero
While you shoot and burn and hang.
I can neither lead nor drive you
When the Maxims tear your ranks.
And no priest can ever shrive you.
But you perish with my thanks!”
So, shaken by cannon and madmen’s laughter,
They all died happily ever after.

A New Australian Mining Story by GEORGE DARRELL.
An intensely interesting story which opens with a murder mystery, in which
the author confides that the wrong man has been punished. The innocent convict,
having served his sentence, starts life afresh in a mining settlement; he does well,
marries and becomes the chief figure in the little community. Then, after 20 years,
in an unaccountable manner, the story of his past is resurrected, and he and his
family are shunned . and become the victims of mining swindlers. That is only
the beginning of a series of thrilling adventures, tempered with a strong love interest,
that make a most readable novel.

Rheumatism
SCIATICA, GOUT, LUMBAGO, etc.
In the majority of cases of Rheumatism,
Gout, Sciatica and similar complaints the
excruciating pain is caused by sharp-pointed
crystals of Uric Acid penetrating- the delicate
and highly-sensitive nerves of the body. To
effect a cure this excess of Uric Acid must be
removed, and no treatment that does not aim
at this result will effect a cure.
Dr. Parker’s Great Indian
Rheumatic Remedy
goes to the root of the trouble, and by remov-
ing' the. cause quickly affords relief and
eventually effects' a permanent cure. Read
the following testimonial:—
SEVERE CASE OF RHEUMATISM CURED.
Merino, Vic.— l suffered terrible pain
across the groin, around the loins and hips,
right down to the ankle. I could not sit up
or lie with any comfort. After taking a few
doses of your medicine I could get about. I
am most thankful to you for the benefit I
have received from your wonderful medicine.
Hoping that others will go to you for relief
and kindness.—Your gratefully,

NOTIONS
The big hurdle race at Caulfield will pro-
vide 61 minutes of anxiety for some of the on-
lookers "next Saturday. Last year, when Uxbridge
scored his second win, the race lasted nearly
seven minutes, but it will probably be a faster
affair this time. Nothing 1 would outstay Wisconsin
(9st. 71b.) at the weight if that uncertain veteran
were in his best jumping 1 humor. But it often
happens that Wisconsin is out of humor, and the 23
little obstacles in the Australian Hurdle Race are
quite likely to worry him. The owner of Jullundur
(list. 131 b.) reckons that the brilliant Grand Nat.
winner has at least a 6 to 1 chance, but if a top-
weight is to win, why shouldn’t it be Obi, the
noblest equine of them all? The ancient champion
has only list. 21b. to carry. Two years ago he
carried list. 111 b. into second place, giving 391 b. to
the winner. Among the middle weights;Van Hom-
reigh looks a real good chance, and perhaps he will
do the ; trick. Which is not to say that anything is
worth considering at less than 5 to 1.
Bullawarra by winning a steeple at Mdonee Valley
heartened all the punters who have got him in
doubles. If the writer had to pick a couple to beat
the trusty Bullawarra next Saturday week he would
pick two little ones—Battleship and Busra.

The S.A. Jockey Club shows in its annual
balance-sheet a loss of a few hundreds on the year;
but then it gave over £lOOO to war funds. Every
race-meeting brought a profit. The A.R.C. went back
about £2OOO, all accounted for by charity or per-
manent improvements, though the Birthday Meeting
has shown a slight loss each of the last two years. Inci-
dentally, the A.R.C. declines even to attend a con-
ference, proposed by some of the S.A. clubs, to dis-
cuss the idea of having racing in the State con-
trolled by a Board instead of by the S.A.J.O. As the
two leading clubs are practically equal in stakes and
programme, it is distinctly sporting of the one to be
content to accept the other as supreme .authority.

A Sydney paper says t-bere are more
sealers attached to Sydney racing nowadays than at
any previous time in the history of the turf.
Maybe ; but relatively to the volume of racing—no.
The fact is that racing is absurdly over-done round
Sydney, and that a bigger tribe of adventurers are
hanging on to it. These include unscrupulous punt-
ers who contrive occasionally to get wagers on the
nod, and more hardy battlers who start with a bag
and some tickets. . One lot scale Ikey and the other
lot scale anyone else who happens along. But the
wails of Ike about the extent of the debts owing to
him are not worth much attention. If he chooses
to bet without getting hold of the cash it is his own
fault when things go wrong. As a rule,
they go the other way, unless his judgment is so
hopelessly bad that he ought, to be wheeling bricks.
Of course, the defaulting fielder is a more or less
permanent institution, but it is certain that even it'
he . is fairly numerous the bookmakers who can and
do meet their liabilities arc proportionately more
frequent now than at any other time. The reason is
that the excessiveness of racing has brought much
plunder to the bag this last, few years, Of course
there has not been so much money lying round
lately as there was a little while ago, and pre-
sently there will be fewer race-meetings. When this
happens it will not be necessary to hold a day of
intercession and prayer in the interests of the Aus-
tralian Horse.
In spite of the beanless punter, whom he can
avoid if he wants to, and an unhappy three or four
weeks lately among the favorites, the fielder who
keeps his head has continued to do quite well. The
world- hears a lot about the losses of Israel but
mighty little about the other side of the industry.
One of the Chosen netted £5OO over the scratching
of Redfern for the Epsom, and probably tells his
more intimate friends that there is nothing in the
game. Over a hundred horses have been entered for
the big Spring handicaps at Randwick and a lot
more for Flemington and Caulfield, and it is going
to be a miracle if 9-10ths of them find no admirers.
But how many will line up at the barrier? _ Making
a book may have ruined a few men, but it is a pur-
suit that has rescued thousands from -the awful
prospect of having to work. Punting has brought
cash to a few —and has kept thousands toiling all
their lives at the heart-breaking pursuit of trying to
get a bit more to go on with.
* * * *
The Australian nag had a birthday on
Tuesday, and instead of there being a public holiday
no one took any notice of the circumstance. But all
horses five years and older are a year more ancient
than they were last week. Prads of six years and
over are like some women. They never get any older.
* * * *
“Quill” : Someone wants to see two-year-
old racing restricted. Very well, but there is no
need for the politicians to mess about with breeding
experiments. Here is a suggestion that would have
definite and salutary results. Let each State run
every spring a State Plate for colts and a State Cup
and Saucer or something for fillies, to be ooen onlv
to three-year-olds which had never started before, and
deposit enough cash in the receptacles to make them
worth going for. They could easily be made
the star events of the year, and the betting is more
than 100 to 1 that, if a couple more rich races were
provided for four-year-olds which had in previous
seasons pursued the crockery, there would be much
solemn thought among trainers and owners about the
advisableness of capturing these races. Of course,
there would be a wild yell from Stiggins, but if every
Stiggins were given a free pass to the meeting the
proceedings could pass off in an atmosphere of great
respectability and a holiness broken only by the
tinkle of the tote.
“Sardonyx”; “Trot” (B. 20/7/T6) con-
firms what I have preached about the injury done by
two-vear-old racing to the stamina of the Australian
thoroughbred. Two-vear-old performances, in any
case, are of little value as a clue to future quality.
Now and then we have a brilliant beginner that
more or less fulfils his early promise, but success in
the class, as a rule, comes from premature develop-
ment at the expense of subsequent stoutness. For
the supreme English racing test —the 21-mile Ascot
Gup—only the best of the best have a chance, and
there has never been amongst the starters (seldom
more than half a dozen) any animal that had made
a precocious reputation. An extreme case, of course,
but the fact is very significant.
“B.O.”: “Ambler” (B. 27/7/’l6) alleges
that in the matter ot breeding- utility horses the
pacer is altogether valueless ; also, that “probably i■;
per cent, of the nags started in Victorian red hots
are pacers.” First of all, an examination of Vic-
torian trotting programmes for a period of 12 months
shows that less than CO per cent, of the starters were
pacers, and that many of these were square-leggeu
pacers, which race without, the “complicated harness
and ironmongery” that causes “Ambler” so much
pain. The assertion that “the pacer is no use out-
side a racing track and no ornament anywhere
would seem to emanate from a jealous mule. The
movements of a pacer travelling’ slowly certainly aie
less graceful than those of a coryphee, but there can
be no doubt about the nag’s usefulness. It is a well-
boned animal, with plenty of substance and endur-
ance. From Yankee pacers are bred a large number
of Indian remounts. Only a week or two back the
writer saw a pacer which had done a mile in 2min.
iCsec. being used as a stock-horse, and it was a
blanky good stock-horse. The statements that pacers
“can only be driven like Hades in a lot of hard-
ware,” and “unless going at tlieir top are always
likely to come down,” are mere unvarnished non-
sense. Nobody but a lunatic would put a horse in
hopples except for racing, and the free-legged pacer
is as sure-footed, as true to its gait and in no more
clanger of coming down than the trotter.

Mountain Knight, having had the injury
he suffered by falling in last Melbourne Cup patched
up, has been purchased for stud duty hv VV. J.
Douglas, of Hawlces Bay (M.L.). Many good nags
have been bred at Te Mahanga, among them two
great- racing mares —Rosefeldt and Tovtulla. But old
Billv Douglas, who founded the place, probably liked
the' jumpers best. He owned one great ’chaser —
Mutiny. Another good ’un was Waterfall.

In a small event in Adelaide lately a
jockey rode two winners in one race. And there was
no dead-heat to be run off, either. A Trial Handicap
had so many entries that it was not safe to let all
run together. So it was cut up into two divisions ;
and llopwood got home first in each.
“Jam Tas”: Talking about falls in
steeplechases. At Melton Mowbray (Tas.), the home
of the famous Panic, the writer saw a steeple in
which there were four starters, and a hicuva steeple
it was. Two of the nags got spread out early in
the game and broke for home and the feed box.
Jillett’s grey went end over end about a mile and a
half from home, but on being caught and remounted
chased Ibbott’s bay at a respectful distance, until at
Page’s-lane the hay turned a seven and struck out
for the Ranges with a stranger in hot pursuit. The
grey then went leisurely along on a lonehand
journey, but rec-
koned there was
too much post and
mil in the second-
to-last fence and
pulled up to in-
spect it. Put at
the edifice again
she tried to refuse,
but a determined
rider forced her
broadside on,
whereupon she
broke.the top rail
off and rolled over
the other three.
Mounted again
without excessive
hurry she proceeded
at a canter to the
last fence and re-
fused some more.
Time being-' no
object just then to
Bob Jillett, he
pulled the lady up
and .had a spell.
But meantime the
pursuing stranger
had caught Ibbott’s
bay, brought him
back to the course,
and, finding the
jockey disabled,
jumped on the ani-
mal and started
after the bacon.
The next thing he
did was to get
alongside the grey
at the last fence
and win on the
post. Any lan-
guage? Yairs,
there was a bit.
WOODFORDE,
of the V.A.T.C.
Lieutenant Stanley Wootten won tlie
Military Cross in France, and by doing it put
another feather in the Australian cap. A Sydney
paper announced soon afterwards that Wootten was
dead, whereupon Sam Monie, railway contractor in
his every-day business life and intimate friend of
Richard Wootten, cabled the father a message of
regret, and received in reply, the intimation that the
youngster was home and convalescent. Same day
that the news of Wootten’s safety was received a
returned soldier named Sutton steered Sylvan Lass to
victory at Moonee Valley (Vic.) in a jumping event
for which Jack Rice, the Sydney hurdler, was
favorite.
John Beamish, who passed out in Victoria
the other day, was practically the founder of pony-
racing in the Peacock preserve. In the days before
Wren arose in his glory Beamish was proprietor of
the Richmond and Croxton Park racecourses. Ley-
land, Dorimer and Nulli Seeundus were among the
nags he raced successfully, and he was owner of
Tattersall’s Horse Bazaar.
Arlos Fanning, the U.S.A. feather, claims
wins in 40 successive scraps. On his perform-
ance against Bert Spargo at Melbourne Stadium
on Saturday night they might easily have been
steer-throwing contests. The Yank was in such a
hurry to seize Spargo by the neck, bash him, endeavor
to wrench his head off and deposit the carcase in the
front stalls that referee Quirk handed Fanning his
walking-ticket in the seventh round after the 635th
warning. Spargo had the sign of the Southern
Cross on Fanning before they started, and his massed
attacks kept America on the edge of preparedness for
disaster. Occasionally Fanning cut loose and pre-
sented something heavy, but his “all-in” tactics took
the gilt off his good work. By the time the referee
thought fit to interrupt the crowd had warmed to
its work and its crowning effort blew the lid off.
* * * *
Blew Edwards, the gritty, unassuming
Welshman who has been doing tilings among Austra-
lian-feathers and lightweights these last few months,
was unable to accumulate points as rapidly as Harry
Stone, the Yankee battler, when they exchanged
smites at Sydney Stadium on Saturday. But Edwards
looked no worse for being outpointed. lie fought aU
through with a fine courage, steadily pursuing Ins
evasive opponent right to the end. But Stone was
ahvays like a door on oiled hinges, and carried out
the business in hand like a tradesman, anticipating
the other fellow ail the time, and nipping the wrath
to come in the bud, so to speak. Also, he never
omitted to bang on when a chance was offering.
There is no doubt that Stone earned his win, but
that doesn’t always mean that the best man came
out on top.
Ned Fitzgerald, the N.Q. featherweight,
made up for lost time when lie met Tommy Ryan at
Brisbane on Saturday. Thomas got it on the neck
from the start, and after lie had reposed on the carnet
or whatever it was 16 times in 12 rounds the referee
said things had gone far enough. Then he placed a
hand on Ned’s youthful head and publicly handed
him the bacon. Wherefore anyone who being light
enough wants a scrap need only mention it to get
Fitz.

George Chip happens along by the next
’Frisco steamer. Mission, Darcy. Object, cash.
( hip is one of Yankeeland's best-known pugs. He
looked like a champion a year or two ago. He is
28, sft. Sin., and makes middleweight easily, and
when he writes his name correctly lie spells it
Chipulonis. Among the conflicts in which he has
raged are recorded six with Buck Crouse, eight with
Jack Billon, and four with Jimmy Clabby.
* * * *
Charley White, the Chicago lightweight,
who meets Welsh next month for the world’s light-
weight title, made a holy show of Milburn Saylor a
few weeks ago. His first hit broke Saylor’s nose, and
before the round was over the k.o. arrived. Saylor,
who is well remembered in Australia, had looked like
a contender for the championship, but doesn’t look
that way any more. This was White’s second one-
roiiud win over him.
Australia’s old friend Billy Papke tried
to come back into the game again the other day, and
probably will not. try any more. An unknown pug
named Jack Smith was put up against him at New
York, and AVilliain reckoned it was a good thing.
But it wasn't. Mr. Smith gave him a hiding.
* * * *
“Eryander”: About ring-side hooliganism
(B. 20/7/’10). The fellow who makes most of the
noise is generally the squib who has no practical
acquaintance with the mittens, and who would steer
clear of hostilities against his own person. If you notice
a “pro.” amongst the spectators you may see him
shift about in his seat or pull down his brows, but you
will never see him open his mouth to clamor. The
blitherers have no use for a contest in which both
men are so skilful that neither can damage the
other much. What they want is skin-and-hair, but
I hope to disturb their monkey minds by telling them
that the principals are so engrossed that for the most
part they don’t even hear the rubbish shouted at
them.
* * * *
McGoorty, who was badly rattled by his
defeat at the hands of Darcy, reckons he can come
back and get in with the best. So does the writer of
this paragraph. If McGoorty will train and deliver
himself in first-class condition he can still beat more
than can beat him and hand something to a few of
the loud persons who are just now blowing off liot-
"air and stalling along on 10-round stunts in Yankee-
land. McGoorty is really the most punishing middle-
weight Australia has seen. He is trying himself, and
if lie can get into form will be out with his hook
again. Of course, it is all a matter of sticking to
work. The wise pug knows that when the day comes
on which he cannot train with joy, the time has come
for him to quit—quick.
* * * *
“L.C.H.S.” : I know something of advertis-
ing, and hate to see a good scheme only half-carried
out. Benny Palmer, the Mexican lightweight,
appeared at the Melbourne Stadium before the Fan-
ning-Spargo unpleasantness on Saturday, got up as
one of Villa's bandits with 50 quids’ worth of
sombrero and a smile. But all he did was to bow,
take his umbrageous hat off and put it on again.
Whgt a shameful waste of opportunity for a hold-up,
with John Wren and half of Israel on the premises!
Or a bit of gun-play? There’s one inveterate hurler
of instructions to pugs there who would have made
a good investment to begin with.
* * * *
One of the oldest of the Australian foot-
ball warriors, Paddy McCue, Newtown (Sydney)
Rugby League’s champion, broke an arm on Saturday.
Writer has had to hold his head to thiitk how long
ago it is since McCue started running after a ball.
Anyhow, he went to England in 'OB with the N. S.
Wales Union team, and insisted on being taken notice
of. On his return the League had sprung into life,
and McCue was one of the Wallabies who refused to
save their amateur status. The change paid him well.
He played repeatedly in representative teams before
he was chosen to go to Britain with the Australasian
team in 1911-12. He was vice-captain that time, and
had the satisfaction of helping to land 35 of the 38
matches played. So McCue was entitled to a rest,
even if he had to break a bone to get it.
* * * *
Gone West —Jack d’Alpuget, Australian
soldier. “Dal,” as all footballers knew him, was one
of flic most brilliant fullbacks the Rugby Union game
knew in Sydney, though this last time he was
playing with the forwards. In 1908 he represented
N. S. Wales and Australia against England. He never
played under the League, although his brother Lou
was one of the originals in that code. Always a
member of the Eastern Suburbs Club the dead soldier
was a fine, breezy chap, who could kick the ball with
cither foot almost the length of the ground. He was
contemporaneous with Dally Messenger, Cecil Murnin,
Norman Row, Malcolm McArthur, Harry Flegg, John
Stuntz, Albert Rosenfeld, Claude Corbett, Sid Pearce
and Harold George (killed at Gallipoli). Jack “Dal”
left Sydney only three months ago, so had lost no
time getting right up into the scrum.
Edward Barrass, who crossed over a few
days ago at Melbourne, was one of the best-known
football umpires thereabouts a generation ago, and
for a long time afterwards handled the flags at the
posts. His yarns about old-time games and adven-
tures would have filled a book. In latter years
Edward was clean out of the limelight, and lived in
peace and quiet. He was flyman in a theatre.
Thinking one war at a time sufficient, the
N.S.W, Soccer Association is propounding peace
proposals to -the Metrop. League. In 1913 the
comparatively few Soccer clubs split into two camps,
the Metrops. refusing to play under district condi-
tions. As players from the two cliques are fighting
alongside one another in the trenches, it is thpugm
foolish to carry on the local conflict. It isn’t much
of a reason; but, then, it is a case in which not
much of a reason is needed.

Finding that last season's apathy had
nearly killed the game and helped baseball and tennis,
N.S.W. Cricket Association is in for a hustle.
War having taken away over 500 players, the Asso-
ciation is going to lift the best of the schoolboys
into grade competitions. The elimination of neutral
territory, a simplified competition table and the eight-
ball over are expected to, after all, obviate a
funeral.

The “Blackham ball,” with which “for
the first time an Australian cricket team beat Eng-
land in a match played on English soil,” is to go into
the Melbourne Museum after raising over £7OO for
wounded Australian soldiers. Prof. Spencer battled
hard against taking it in, observing that it. was
neither a work of art nor a scientific exhibit. He
was backed by Dr. Deeper, who said that if they
took Blackham’s ball they could not refuse Murdoch’s
bat. But the rest of the committee were willing to
chance even that, so they said thanks, and are going
to put it in the Technological Museum.

From the Far North :
Frank Birtles, indomitable motor battler along
back tracks, last week ran in from Bu'rketown. lo
Cloncurry. He set out to break the record for the
240 miles of roads that know no repairing gangs,
where bridges or culverts are unknown, and rivers
and creeks are numerous. He clipped four hours off
the previous best, doing the rush with a troublesome
radiator in some minutes'over 13 hours. He intends
later, ’ with better luck, to lower the time by a
couple of hours.
Jack Booth (Vic.) last week knocked his
own world’s mile motor-cycle record down to
37 3-ssec. (95f m.p.h.) ; and for five miles to 3min.
25 3-ssec. (88 m.p.h.). He also picked up the Vic.
motor-cycle 10-mile scratch race. Keeping track of
these records is a strenuous business. Meanwhile
Bob .Finlay and H. A. Parsons are oiling up to chase
Fame on spinning wheels.
* * * *
Garrett, who with Percy won the pairs
handicap at Killara (N.S.W.) tennis tournament the
other day, is a son of Tom Garrett, the Ma State’s
Public Trustee. For a while he made an effort to
knock out dad’s great cricket record, but it didn’t
come off. Now his form with the racquet makes him
look something out of the. ordinary behind a net.
Old-man Tom takes relaxation solemnly these times.
He has fallen a victim to golf.
Henry Cliarlick, of Adelaide, after playing
cliess for over half a century, heard someone call
“Mate” last week. At 16 he outed all competitors,
and later on became S.A.’s champion exponent of the
strenuous game of think, life once played 28 games
simultaneously, winning 24, drawing three and losing
one. That tremendous struggle was said to have been
a most exhilarating circumstance. No one spoke.
The battle raged for three hours. In business he
was in the Adelaide Register's commercial depart-
ment, and had been “Chess Editor” of the paper
since the ’sixties.

The U.S.A. National swimming champion-
ship over 220 yards was won on May 29 bv Claire
Gailigan, of New York, at Atlantic City. It was the
first officially authorised Amateur Athletic Union
event ever arranged for the distance in Yankland.
Claire spent 3min. 15 4-osee. on the journey. Fanny
Durack’s time for 220 yards is 2min. 52sec.

A star baseballer is still worth a bob or
.two in Yankeeland. Speaker, of Boston (in Australia
a year or two back with the Giants-White Sox), was
“sold” to Cleveland lately for a pile of dollars
equal to £12,500. The people who found the cash
have to pay Speaker £5O a week wages.. And he
isn’t as young as lie was, either.
Rowing in the Speck has lost one of its
oldest and stoutest supporters in R. J. Lucas, who
died at Hobart recently. He was one of the founders
of the S. Tas. Rowing Association, afterwards known
as the Tasmanian Rowing Union, and was aswirl in
aquatics for close on 50 years. He often represented
the Speck at mainland carnivals.

“Jwosp” : People on the boards often ask
why they cannot get good sketches for vaude-
ville work. Perhaps it is because there are
too many sinister coincidences. Three years
ago a Christchurch (M.L.) pressman showed
me a sketch which he proposed to
send to an American magazine. The
story concerned a chap who entered
a room, saw his wife in the arms of
a man, promptly shot them both, and on
seeing their faces remarked explosively,
“Damn it! The wrong fiat!” This sketch
was offered to a travelling actor who was
plaintively asking for sketches and talking
glibly of good money. He spurned the play-
let after reading it, and the next heard is
that a similar idea has struck someone con-
nected with a revue. It is coincidences of
this kind which make the author shy.
He is a “ver’ grand-a the opera singer—
ah magnif!” He was at a Sabbath evening
festival in the home of a rich amateur, when
somebody at his elbow said: “Ah, there is
Madame !” The superb tenor glanced
at the new-comer languidly. “Madame
!” he said. “And she is who, eh?”
“Why,” said the amazed chatterer, “she’s
in your company, isn’t she?” “Ver-a pos-
seeble,” said the singer. “But I have-a
neffer meet her.”
“Row G.”: The owner of a beautiful
breath of the bush was in a front seat at a
high-class concert during the sheep sales in
Sydney. He was uproariously enthusiastic,
and did two strong men’s recall work when
the star was coyly pretending that he hated
applause and didn’t want to be brought
back. But he ruined an otherwise good
social record by roaring, “Give th’ bloke
at th’ pianner a quid ! Go on, mate —give
’im a quid ! I’d give ’im a couple o’ quid .’
A fluttering usher was trying to explain that
such a proceeding would be ultra vires when
I lost sight of the show.
“Jwosp” : Eric Maxon scrambled into the
cast for Herbert Tree’s New York produc-
tion of “The Merchant of Venice.” He played
Lorenzo in English, but the majority of the
cast spoke the United States language.
There are easier ways of working for a
living than working a mangle, and the Mel-
bourne “beat” Vho hit upon the device of
working a street band discovered one of
them. The method was very simple. While
the peripatetic musicians blared their
melodies in suburban streets in the cool of
the evening, the humble embezzler, with a
battered old brass bugle in his hand, stole
from door to door, taking up the offertory,
and retired from solicitation with a hatful
only when the infuriated official collector
was hot on his heels. The band was soak-
ing him in a trough when the police inter-
vened.
“E.T.”: Re “The Show Shop” (B.
29/G/Y6), in which Sydney-born Marie
Lb hr is playing lead in London, two. other
players known to Australia figure in the
short cast, viz., A. E. Matthews and Edmund
Gwen'n. The author, James Forbes, was
responsible for “The Chorus Lady,” in
which Muriel Starr appeared at Sydney
Criterion, and also “The Travelling Sales-
man.” which was Fred Niblo’d at the same
theatre.
“8.J.” : Cecil King, the good-looking young
man who was here about three years ago as
“producer” of that solemn piece of Biblical
humbug, “Joseph and His Brethren,”
has become engaged to Phyllis Neilson-
Terry, daughter of Fred Terry and Julia
Neilson. She’s a young actress whose
talents are as considerable as her personal
attractions. Cecil has for some years been
Beerbohm Tree’s stage-manager, and was
merely loaned to J.C.W. for the production
■ of “Joe & Bros.”
What would the wowsers of to-day have
thought of the Melbourne of 60 years ago?
Here’s an advt. printed on the back of the
■ book of the panto, at Melbourne Royal:—
TATTERSALL’S HOTEL and CASINO DE VENICE,
Bourke Street.
Dancing Every Evening at 10 o’clock. Admission Is.
Grand Masquerade and Fancy Dress Ball on Boxing
Night and New Year’s Night. Admission 2s. 6d.
“Harrison O.”: In an introduction to
“Matsu” (“The Pine Tree”), written in the
early part of the eighteenth century by
Takeda Izumo, a Jap dramatist, there is
an explanation of why actresses are rare in
Japan, and why theatres in that country are
only two storeys high. A law forbidding
women to take part in theatrical perform-
ances was passed in 1643 —a time when
strolling players were numerous and their
morals loose. The law is not now enforced,
but it has not been quite forgotten, and
Yum-Yum has never been stage struck in
large quantities. A law that no theatre
shall be more than two storeys high was
reckoned necessary because of the goings-on
on the third floor of some theatres. Several
playhouses made a feature of their third
floor, which could be reached by secret pas-
sages from the manager’s office, the profits
being shared by mime and manager.
An English play at last! It is to follow
“Romance” at Melbourne Royal, and is by
the author of “The Lifeguardsman” and
“The Midnight Wedding,” which we’ve had
already. The new thriller bears the Family
Herald title of “The Story of the Rosary.”
and like all the rest of them is “just the
thing the public wants.”
“Ho ho!”: Never has my sensitive ear
been offended by more stilted and preposter-
ous dialogue than that in “Romance.” The
author seems to have ransacked ’All Caine,
the Bible, the Family ’Erald and Dan
O’Connor’s private dictionary, and the result
is something that no audience not composed
exclusively of romantic servant-girls and
actors should be called upon to listen to.
Sometimes it sounds like oratorio and some-
times like the Song of Solomon done in rag-
time and played with a noisy accompaniment
of cymbals. Always it gives one the im-
pression that it should not be delivered by
mere mimes, but by a steam siren, a big drum
and a couple of spruikers specially trained
for marathon oratory. The speech; or what-
ever it is, hurled by the parson-hero in the
last act at the naughty operatic vocalist,
should not be delivered at all; it should be
bottled and used as asphyxiating gas.

How to Treat Your Hair and Complexion.
A Few Simple Beauty Hints.
By Mdlle. GABY DESLYS, the well-known Parisian Actress.
YOU ask me for a few hints on the
treatment of the hair and complexion.
Well, the less “treatment” you give
the skin the better. I do not
believe much in massage, but a
little cream to the face is neces-
sary to counteract the effects .of
wind or sun. What cream
would I recommend? Well, 1
advise you to use a little mel-
odised wax every night and
again in the morning, after
washing the face. Hub it
gently into the skin, then wipe
off any superfluous wax and
dust a little barri-agar over
the face. You will.,;.find that
this-.will be the oftly ' “treat-
itieul.” necessary am] will keep
yotff l face fresh ami youthful-

thing is a good shampoo. Never use any-
thing inferior to wash the hair with. (,< ‘ l
some good stallax from your chemist and use
a teaspoonful in a cup of hot
water. Then rinse the hair
well and it will look bright and
glossy- , ..
A tonic is necessary when the
hair is inclined to fall out more
than if should, and is always
good to use during the spring
and autumn. Then the hair
needs a little—what do you call
it? —stimulant, and for this l
would advise you to get a packet
of boranium and mix it with
somd bay rum ; dab this into the
roots- and it will not only stop
the fall, but make your hair
grpw long and thick. Give your
looking for all your lift l . The mercolised
wax removes all the dead outer skin, so
that you have always a fair, fresh com-
plexion like a girl’s.
For the hair, the first and most important
hair a good brushing every night, and that
will be all that you need do.
WA
Blackheads Fly Away.
Instantaneous Remedy for Blackheads, Greasy Skin and Enlarged Pores.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into
general use in the boudoir. It is very
simple, harmless and pleasant. Drop a
stymol tablet, obtained at the chemist’s, in
a tumblerful of hot water. After the effer-
vescence has subsided bathe the face in the
liquid, using a small sponge or soft cloth.
In a few minutes dry the face and the offen-
sive blackheads will come right off on the
towel. Also the large oily pores immedi-
ately close up and efface themselves natu-
rally. The greasiness disappears and '.lie
skin is left smooth.. soft and cool. This
simple treatment is then repeated a few
times at intervals of four or live days, to
ensure the permanence of the result.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned Recipe restores Youthful Appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey
hair is not desirable, and plenty of reasons
why hair dyes should not be used. But, on
the other hand, there is no reason why. you
should have grey hair if you do not want
it. To turn the hair back to a natural color
is really a very simple matter. One- has
only to get from the chemist two ounces of
concentrate of tammalite and mix it with
three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the
hair with a small sponge for a few nights
and the greyness will gradually disappear.
This liquid is not sticky ,or greasy and does
not injure the hair in any way. It has been
used for generations with most satisfactory
results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of Superfluous Hair.
The most Effective Formula ever Discovered,
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. ror
this purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed, not only to instantly remove the
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the' growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
Good News for Fat People.
Something New in Obesity Cures.
A London chemist says: “The latest
method of reducing obesity certainly is far
more pleasant and convenient than all pre-
vious methods. It consists merely in eating
clynol berries. The fat person who wants
to reduce without the usual rigid diet, exer-
cise, sweating baths, etc., now puts a
of these little brown berries in his or hei
pocket and eats three or four each day.
Clynol berries not only eliminate fat nom
the bodv. but also correct the tendency
which is usually constitutional, to create
fatty matter. No discomfort whatever is
caused by their action; in fact, except for
the loss of superfluous fat and the feeling
of “fitness” so created, you would not be
aware that these little berries were doing
their work.
Local inquiry shows that clynol berries .ue
not very well known in this country, but
the demand is increasing daily, and any
chemist can quickly procure them if specially
requested to do so.

Ileg Wykelmm : Letter and “Astra” to hand.
Good luck all round... .G.R.H.: Rcciuiter
missed by an inch and an ingrowing tooth An
Australian (Paris): Thanks; luck... .C.G.: Don t
know why men swear, unless because there is a tax
on other amusements.... Corio: What s the use of
urging the snake-bitten to waste time on a remedy
you “won't vouch for” ? Do you want to stand your
trial for manslaughter ?.... Romney: M hat s it all
about? J. 8.: Can’t say such things at present. .. .
L.D.: Wish we could see it differently.... Don’t
Think: Wouldn’t if we were y0u.... J.H.: “Officers’
Mess” too -rugged.... S.A.K.: Those silk stockings
don’t stir our pulse.—E.S.: Why do you stick
your sheets of paper together m that way? Do
you think that by making your copy hard to handle
you improve a subeditor’s temper ?... .J.S.C.:
Hurled!... .U.S.: Humor in the rheumatism idea.
Use a lighter hand E..0.P.: Doesn’t grip
L.P.J.: Humor too machine-made. .. .J. A. P.: Not
nearly up.... T.W..: Good idea ; poor verse. . . .M.A.:
“Little Redcap” isn’t happy 11. J.S.: Sorry;
must go back... .C.G.C.C.: Well, that’s a lame item.
.. . . H.L.H.: So that’s your idea of an Anzac. Seems
more like a description of an undersized Cockney
on Bank Holiday M.S.: Dying-gladiator melo-
drama slain; .. .H.P.G.: Doesn’t get there....
P.D.E.H.: Some good lines; some vile. . . .R.P.S.:
Easy verse, as bloodless as an empty paper-bag....
R.G.H.: Good idea, but lines bump murderously....
Incognito: Both impossible ’ yarns. .. .<T.S.: Too
labored and bumpy... . K.C.M.: You may undeceive
him at once. It is the merest commonplace. .. L.D.:
Bring your German spy right in:—
. . ..E.E.M.: Its chief faults are poor versification,
lack of ideas and general weariness. . . G.R.H.: “Com-
ing Day” wants more help... .Flinders Id.: Men have
been murdered for bigger offences. .. .S.M.: Not quite.
. ...L.K.: It jerks clumsily with a short allowance
of rhymes. .. .Bracken: You can't dream, yearn, pine,
long and sigh for the lady here. ..-Bill Ken: “Won-
derful Healer” doesn't raise a smile—. .F.M.K.:
Many thanks; but the society you mention is partly
a. trading one, and its German printings are not the
ones that absorb British subscriptions. .. .WAV.S.:
“Cronje” is a rather commonplace trickster....
Peace Proud: Don’t see much fantasy about it. . ...
Gaynet: Glad to hear about those mountains “rising
majestically in their blue coverings which were
shaded in an artistic manner by the rays of the
rising sun.”. .. . A.T.M.W.: Good method; wretched
yarn. .. .Ilgidlera: Your, ideas are not bad, but you
have a rough touch, and must mend your rhymes and
scansion—especially scansion. .. .G.IT.: “Dust” to
dust returneth. .. . R.D.: Murchison* yarn no good.
You can’t write without taking some pains....
E. 8.: Your story wobbles all over the place, and
Bill doesn’t get into focus at all. .. . A.M.L.: Un-
pleasant yarn lacks humor.... TAV.: You don't make
much of it.... The Gull: Some points, but not well
enough done... .Cable Clerk : Not up... .M.H.:
School-girl twaddle-play too long and too feeble.
.. . . J. 8.: “Old Play Bill” just misses. . . .The
Shirker: A flat, dull mess of clumsy words. .. .Bill
Adams: It's a brilliant bit of fancy:—
.. . .1.D.: “After Victory” is commonplace. “Rover’s
Song” has some merit, but not quite up... .R.S.T.:
If the writing were as powerful as the brag it would
push everything else out.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.11.L.: ’Struth, it’s very bad.... Daniel M.:
Study drawing, Dan, and try again in five
years’ time.... Harry C.: Leave England alone.
Lott strafe the artist 1... .Joseph II.: Both
lack humor. .. .E.P.: A weak jest and you can't
draw... .L.S.: No bai-joves to-day, thanks
AAV.A.: The stretcher-bearers have just taken it
away. . . .C.A.C.P.: Very pathetic. .. .E.S.: It
scratches and whines at the locked door of Art....
RAV.C.: It looks a gloomy sort of thing. We won't
go into it.. . .N.McC.: Another 20 years or 50....
W.l’.: 0 Lord, no !.. . . A.M.S.: An ink-worm might
have done it. .. .T.D.K.: Dare not tell you what we
think of it. .. .M.VV.B.: “I trust it will be accepted.”
Trust no more.
“F.N.T.”: Old man Podkin had had bad
luck with his stock and his health and his
mortgage, wherefore the Podkin homestead
and furnishings arid stock and plant were
being sold off. There was a good muster
of neighbors from a 20-mile radius, and
most of the goods went at their value, for
the benefit of the creditors. Young Jack
Podkin. who was going -off to another State
to try his luck, had put in a few articles
for auction on his own account, including a
bridle. When the bridle went up, somebody
started a whisper round the circle: “It’s
young Jack’s.” Bidding suddenly became
brisk. O’Flynn, from Yarra Flats, stood
beside McSquhirter, of Bonnie Doon, watch-
ing the proceedings with approval. The
price offered went up from ()’Flynn’s 255.,
bid with a cheerful grin, to £4 155., and was
then knocked down to big. long, brown Bill
Smith, of Smith's Gully. O’Flynn rubbed
his hands together cheerfully and banged
McSquhirter on the shoulder. “There-r-r,”
he said, “ that's th’ way to do ut!”
McSquhirter retained his air of. impene-
tiable gloom. “Foor fufteen!” lie gruffed.
“An’ ye can get th’ like onywheer for fuf-
teen shullin'!”
An aeroplane went whizzing by
And came to earth with a German spy,
He landed behind the British line,
And thought he could take his own time
For getting information; and was drawing his plan
When something hit him and he ran ;
But an Anzac —no one bolder,
Ban after him and grabbed his shoulder,
He said “What are you doing with that plan, you
wretch. - ’
And the spy said “It's only a sketch.”
But tho Anzac said “You German brute,”
\n'd kicked the spy to death with his military boot.
They Germans they surrendered nil,
They gave our Bill a cheer ;
Then Bill he made a speech and gave
Each one a great long beer.
The Kaiser grew quite mad at this,
His temper highly rose ;
Bill Hughes walked straight up to him and
Hit him upon the nose,
“That is the answer,” Billy said,
“Australia makes to you ;
And all the world sang out, “Well done!”
From China to Peru.

BANANA LAND
Governor Goold-Adams apologised to
Charleville tlie other day for not having-
visited it previously—an omission due to
the drought. This time his arrival synchro-
nised with a general wet. llow history
repeats itself! It was just the same in
Governor Arthur Painter’s day. livery time
that genial old ex-bullocky visited a country
(or any other) town there wasn’t a dry
mouth in the place.
Brisbane had a strike of sanitary wo-leers
the other day ; and. although the men struck
in open defiance of the Industrial Peace Act,
a final settlement gave them what they de-
manded. The award of the. Court under
which they were working was only three
months old, but daily experience had taught
them that awards are only a fortified base
to start raiding from. And if their daily ex-
perience hadn’t taught them. Justice Hig-
gins’s most recent liurroos would surely have
stirred them to action. Just where the pub-
lic comes in—the poor, tired public—his
Honor hasn’t explained.
“Quisquam” : The Ryan Government is
not devoted to the spoils-to-the-victor idea.
Mostly, since it took office, anything worth
while has gone to 'political opponents. A
few weeks ago applications were called from
•‘persons engaged in the profession of jour-
nalism” for the position of advertising
manager to the Government. About 50
eapables, etc., dashed at the bait and, after
weeks of silence, it was announced that Fred
Watson, at present advertising manager for
T. C. Beirne and Co., and previously in the
same capacity with Finney Isles, was the fish.
Watson has long proved his ability to write
alluringly of corsets, condensed milk, flat-
irons, ice-cliests, kimonos and lavender gloves.
And, as everyone knows, this is an essential
amongst “persons following the profession of
journalism.”
“Curtins”: Listen to the story of the
Donor's Ilill (N.Q.) telegraph office and
then consider the economies of the Depart-
ment controlling it. Twenty-three years ago
the State Government established an office at
that repiote but picturesque spot, but as it
was an experiment the Department did not
erect a building, arranging instead with the
proprietors of the Donor’s Hill station for
the use of one at a rental of £52 a year.
The same building is still occupied, and, so
far, about £l2OO has been paid in rentaLfor a
place which cost no more than, say, £250 to
build.
It’s a habit with some families. Reg
Webb and brother Alf, of Indooroopilly,
were among the first Australians on Gal-
lipoli. Reg was killed the afternoon of the
Landing. Alf had three hours rushing after
Turks before a bullet punctured his right
lung. lie is now in Ilarefield (Eng.) get-
ting fit for France. The father of the boys
received the Royal Humane Society’s silver
medal for the rescue of the Jackson family
in the Brisbane River in 1803, and grand-
father did great things in the Indian Mutiny
with the Bth Hussars.
Major Tolmie, M.L.A., has just returned
from Egypt, whither he has been leading
transports, and in an interview the other
day made this martial noise :
Many months away from a place like Queensland,
where new questions are continually arising, makes
one lose that intimacy with current political affairs
which is necessary if bolt for holt is to be hurled
back over the Parliamentary benches.
That, of course, is what Tolmie and the
others are there for—to entrench themselves
behind party and hurl dead cats at the other
crowd while the country pays through the
nose and wonders drearily when its business
is to be attended to.
“Nick Bottom”: If Tudor, Minister for
Customs, thinks that he found a piece of
“no-man’s land” on the occasion of his
recent visit to Tweed Heads he makes a
mistake. The “buffer area” belongs indis-
putably to Ma, the fence on the N.S.W. side
having been erected by that State to pre-
vent the tick-infested cattle of the Banana-
land side from contaminating their southern
neighbors. If any person doubts this, let
him get foul of the law on the N.S.W. side
and seek sanctuary in the buffer area, and
I’ll bet that the N.S.W. police will fetch
him out of it quick and merry. On the
other hand, if he cuts up rusty on the
Queensland side and gets into the area in
KIDS, UNLTD.
MR. BAILS: “I am pleased to tell you we hare had a prosperous year. Mum has broke
the record with triplets. After a trifling sum for the feeding and clothing of the
family I shall draw a dividend of £2 p r week per child." (Loud and sustained
applause.)
question, the Johns of that State must seek
the aid of their N.S.W. brethren before he
can be brought to book. Incidentally, the
buffer area varies in width from a few feet
at Tweed Heads to a few chains further out
along the McPherson Range. I can’t say
exactly how far it extends along the border,
but I know 10 miles of it as well as I know
my prayers.
“Politicus”: By submitting all sorts of
wild requests Queensland railway employees
are making the Labor Government wish it
had never been born. Here is a typical case.
Some time ago the clerks in Turniptown
arranged to work an extra half hour per day
in return for an extension of the Saturday
half-holiday, and to this the Department
agreed. As soon as the concession was made
good, the men met again and resolved that
this half-hour should be regarded as over-
time and paid for accordingly. The Depart-
ment’s concurrence is not yet announced;
but it will be squeezed out all right.
A North Queensland police identity died
the other day at Manly ( N.S.W.) —John
Bacey Isley, aged 70. He arrived in Sydney
in 1857, went north, and after some time
joined the Native Police as a cadet. In
this force he served 30 years and rose to
the rank of inspector—saw service all
through the Palmer and other gold rushes,
provided many an escort, and incidentally
saved many a Chinese miner from the pot
of black brother.
Slumber Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O little tired love of mine,
Lie still upon my heart!
Outside the sultry moonrays shine,
And every lonely, watching pine
Stands motionless, apart.
No longer does the south wind blow,
Nor any breath of breeze ;
But in the air the dull red glow
Of bush-fire gleams, and thick and low
The smoke hangs in the trees.
Across the night the long-drawn cry
Of some curlew is borne.
Its note re-echoes, weird and high.
And wakes thee too —Oh. hush-a-bye,
Sleep softly till the morn !
Upon the far horizon’s line
Lights of the city dart;
And art thou weary of their shine?
Then shut those tired eyes of thine,
And sleep, O little love of mine,
Sleep deep upon my heart!
QUEENSLAND.
R. A. SMITH.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 29, 1916.
My Dear Tiiargomindaii,—
Four Dufault concerts, an Orchestral
Society night, three patriotic turnouts and a
Red Cross Day have kept the hamlet gay
this week. * The chief patriotic outburst
was at the Stadium in aid of Red Cross
funds. His Ex. and Lady attended, and
there was a crowded ringside.
Hammond’s contralto and Mrs. Mark
Harris’s soprano were successfully fitted,
and boxing turns (comic and otherwise)
and military and gymnastic displays
crowded the rest of the night. By the way,
iz is hardly a fair thing to expect singers to
try to fill this huge barn with their voices,
but promoters might help a little by placing
the piano on the platform, instead of several
fathoms below.
To-night his Ex. patronised an entertain-
ment in the Centennial Hall, organised by
the Girls’ Club, in aid of tlie Comforts
Funds of the 41st and 42nd Battalions.
When is somebody going to begin funds for
the 9th and isth, Queensland’s nrst and best-
beloved Billjims? Or, better still, let s
pool the whole of the efforts. For Bill who
left with the 10th is probably in the 116th
now. As things are, the (say) 116th, hav-
ing been formed in Egypt out of Australians
from other battalions, hasn’t a friend to do
a thing for it.
Mrs. Harry Beeve gave a cheerful enter-
tainment in the South Brisbane Technical
College on Tuesday night in aid of the Resi-
dential Club for Returned Soldiers and
Sailors. Corona, once the residence of Dr.
Peter Bancroft, has been selected as the
club building.
The women who are working for the Com-
forts Fund for the Miners and Engineers
have done splendid work. Thirty-nine cases
were packed this week, and will be
despatched as soon as space is available. A
generous contribution from Mt. Morgan is
included, and Charters Towers and Towns-
ville also have helped.
Last Tuesday the kiddies at Nudgee
Orphanage had an unexpected treat. Paul
Dufault and his company arrived and gave
them a concert. On Friday the tenor and
his company visited the Military Hospital
at Kangaroo Point and entertained the sick
and wounded. The boys’ faces signalled
thanks, and the committee put it into words.
Does anyone want to adopt a lonely sol-
dier? If so, write to Mrs. Graham Milne,
Lota House, Manly (Q.), and she will see
that the name and address of an Australian
soldier who is without next-of-kin will be
forwarded. A list of these Billjims is. being
compiled by permission of the military
authorities. Anyone who joins the Lonely
Soldiers’ League must promise to post a
paper, a postcard or some trifle each week.
Miss Nan Macansh, a capable and energetic
patriotic worker, is helping Mrs. Milne.
Flight-Lieut. Cedric Hill, of Fassifern, is
a prisoner in Turkey. He was a member of
barrister Tom Macleod’s Volunteer Flying
Corps. Before Jacky got him he put up
a great flight, and then, finding his cake
dough, burnt his plane.
A young lieut. of Engineers, who spent
seven months at Gallopli and was invalided
home, cherishes a small white scar on his
left wrist. It is the kiss of a kukri, and was
put there by a small and admiring Ghurka,
Who wished to claim the Queenslander as a
blood brother.
Mrs. W. 11. Robertson, of Rockhampton,
one of the most zealous of workers, is col-
lecting old kid gloves to line jackets for
Australian airmen. As aviators require new
jackets continually, there’s plenty of work
to be done to keep their wardrobes stocked.
Lieutenant Graham Stewart Galloway, an
old Gympie boy, has been killed in action in
France. Educated at St. Joseph’s College,
Hunter’s Hill (N.S.W.), he afterwards had
a course at Hawkesbury Agricultural Col-
lege, where he won the Burdekin prize. For
some time he was sugar planting in Fiji.
All five Galloway boys picked up rifles when
war began. Four met death on the battle-
field, and the remaining one is fighting in
German East Africa,
The 25th Battalion, composed entirely of
Queenslanders, and very largely of back-
countrymen, has an energetic comforts com-
mittee with a nest in the Courier buildings.
It has laid itself out to send the boys some-
thing extra for Christmas, and it doesn’t
want them to shiver at any time. Hence its
appeal for money (the Courier will take
charge of that) or goods (give them to the
committee at the Courier buildings). You
won’t feel comfortable till you’ve sent them
half a crown.
Edmund Jowett. one-time squire of
Kynuna, has had more definite information
of son Eric, the airman. The machine
descended under partial control and was
destroyed on landing. The pilot was sev-
erely injured but was not killed, as was at
first reported. These hard Western men
pass easily from a pig-rooter’s back to a
buck-jumping aeroplane, and are as difficult
to “out” by the one as the other.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
At 13 Elsie Shaw’s mother made her the
associate of Chows and niggers; at 17 she
was a registered woman of the slums; at
26 she killed a paramour in a drunken
brawl. Judge Lukin gave her live years for
the murder and said he would recommend
her discharge at the end of two years if her
record was good. Last week, however, it
was announced that the Home Secretary
had released her after she had served in all
about nine or 10 weeks. If the object of
imprisonment is punishment, what punish-
ment was this? If reform, to what extent
is Elsie Shaw a reformed character after
passing some GO or 70 days in confinement?
“Wanderer" : How about this for a
record? At Warwick the other day a,recruit
named Knight, 33 years of age, admitted
having already earned five war medals (17
clasps) and the V.G. He had been eight
years in the British Army.


O

ARLYLE has said that 4 music is a
kind of inarticulate, unfathomable
speech which leads us to the edge
of the Infinite, and compels us for a
moment to gaze into it.” It is the universal
language of the feelings which increases sym-
pathy and broadens the horizon of mankind.
Herbert Spencer in his “Origin and Function
of Music” has placed it at the head of the
fine arts, declaring that music cannot be too
much applauded as a noble means of minis-
tering to human welfare. Thus these two
gifted Englishmen give voice to the feelings
which stir in the hearts of the masses. But
how is music to be made a real part of home-
life ? The logical answer is

Public Announcement
The Radio Health Institute
begs to intimate to its numerous patients and in-
tending patients that it has moved to larger and
better-equipped quarters at Station House, Rawson
Place, Sydney.
“WE RADIATE HEALTH.”
The Radio Health Institute is under the able
direction of Prof. Adams, M.A., LL.D.. 11.5 c., grad-
uate of Harvard and Columbia Universities, the
discoverer of the marvellous V-ray and Uni-direc-
tional Hertzian wave current, by which use lONIZED
OXYGEN is introduced into the system, expelling
death-dealing disease germs and literally permeating
,the deeper tissues of the body with the vitalising
force of Etheric Electrons. This form of treatment
embraces all the recent scientific discoveries emanat-
ing from the celebrated therapeutic institutions at
Paris, Nancy, Brussels, London and New York.
All the results of the researches and discoveries
in the realm of Electro Statics and Ray Science are
faithfully and skilfully utilised at the Radio Health
Institute.
The prefected Static generator employed by Prof.
Adams and used solely at the Radio Health Institute
is at once the most costly, modern and the most
effective instrument now in use in any part of the
world. Its marvellous curative powers transcend the
most sanguine expectations of the most far-visioned
optimist.
Prof. Adams is a scientist of exceptional ability,
and after many years of painstaking study has dis-
covered a POSITIVE ozonic ray, the V-Ray, whose
potency vastly transcends the emanations of that
rare substance known as radium. The antiseptic
attributes and miracle-working powers of the V-Ray
invest it with peculiar value in the treatment of
open wounds. Eczema, Acne and every form of skin
disease speedily vanish under the healing touch of
this curative force. Atrophied muscles are restored,
and sufferers from, the graver forms of disease, such
as paralysis, locomotor ataxia and rheumatoid
arthritis, find material benefit or an absolute cure.
At the Radio Health Institute we radiate health.
Pain-stricken, diseased, distressed bodies and worry-
worn minds are introduced to the sunny-souled god-
dess of health. Our patients are courteously treated,
and all receive the personal supervision of Prof.
Adams. As only a limited number of patients can
be treated daily, disappointment may be avoided by
arranging appointments in advance. Hours, from
9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Address all communications
to Department 8., Radio Health Institute, Station
House, Rawson Place, Sydney.
HAVE YOU A
BAD LEG
perhaps so surrounded with inflammation and
swollen that when you press your finger on
the inflamed part it leaves the impression i
If so, under the skin you have poison, which
defies the remedies you have tried. Perhaps
vour knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round
which the skin may be discolored. The disease,
if allowed to continue, will deprive you of
the power to walk. You may have attended

not. Try the great British Remedy:—

The Story of the Lamp
U
&
m
In Ancient Babylon, 3000 B.C.
The men of the “stone age” period used
lamps fashioned in stone. The earliest
known lamps were those discovered by
scientists amongst the excavations in Baby-
lonia and Assyria, on the Mesopotamian
plains. The lamps unearthed were of un-
glazed terra-cotta and excellent workman-
ship, taking various forms such as birds,
hands, and feet. It is not to be expected
that the Babylonians could produce a
burning oil so perfect as
Laurel Kerosene
The soft whi'e light
Laurel gives a soft but brilliant light,
perfectly steady, without smoke or smell,
and is very restful to the eyes. Laurel is
our new trade mark name for the highest
quality American Kerosene ever 1 a

The trouble between the Melbourne
papers and P.M.G. Webster is furious
jealousy —on the part of the papers. They
know Webster's literary quality. This is
the disadvantage of giving a man Cabinet
rank on account of his achievements with
the-pen in a State like Victoria, where the
papers are all the time looking not for
Masters to worship but for Rivals to
wallop. Nevertheless. no Syme or
Mackinnon can for ever suppress geysers
like this “Call from the Trenches,’' the
handiwork of W. Webster, M.P. :
This last verse, lathes and gentlemen, is our
own : —
Now, then, Meter Blooming Anars,
And now, then, Mister Blooming Aon,
Throw overboard your jealous cargoes,
Let Webster take liis proper place upon the stage.
Don't use the blue-pencil upon the Postmaster-
General,
For Web. is best when Web. is unadorned;
If you won’t listen we know who’s will be the
funeral,
And two papers will go to the grave unmourned.
A man named Waters appeared in a
Sydney court the other day on a charge of
wife-assault. She said lie came home quarrel-
some and she tried to pacify him. He swore
she made the attempt by flinging a lamp at
his head. Seems to he another instance
where throwing oil on the troubled Waters
failed.
Dear Bulletin, —I have just secured
Douglas Sladen’s “From Boundary Rider to
Prime Minister.” In the first 100 pages
W. M. Hughes is variously hailed as Nelson,
Lincoln, Chatham and Thucydides. I
thought it as well to let you know this at
the earliest possible moment; but as I have
still 115 pages to read I will have to reserve
Mr. Sladen’s final judgment for a later
communique.—Yours excitedly, Harrison
O. P.S. —Since writing the above I have
learnt from Mr. Slade that Hughes “22
years ago dawned in the south-eastern ex-
tremity of the world from absolute poverty
by the innate greatness of his soul.” Can
vo« tell me if this is •really so, and why?—
ii.o.
At the end of the cold month of June,
Henry Hatfield was convicted for the 140tli
time at Hobart. The trouble was “drunk
and disorderly,” as usual, and the yawning
Bench valued it at £1 or 34 days. The
money was only mentioned in a formal way.
What a beautiful record for a State to have
to own —139 punishments that have been
ineffective, and a 340th inflicted without a
grain of hope that it will do any better
than the rest!
“Ivaniva” : Ballarat is dying on its feet.
The landlord of Lester’s Hotel, one of the
best-known houses on the old \ ictorian field,
has surrendered his license and unscrewed
the cash-register, owing to the slowness of
trade. Fully 50 years ago T. S. Bellair, an
actor of note and supporter of G. V. Brooke,
raked the first money over the counter.
Alfred Lester acquired the house some IP
years later when it was one of the foremost
in Ballarat. The ancient beermark now
becomes a coffee palace and a refuge for
teetotallers.
“Centurion” : The Prince of IV ales, while
in Egypt, wanted to see our lot, too.
When he got his chance there was
no formal parade, but the men lined
up along the road and cheered him
mightily, the Prince saluting as he
went along. Unhappily, just before he
came to Brigade Headquarters, he overlooked
a group (it wasn’t far from the canteen).
As he passed on. a chant rose behind him,
“One, two. three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nme, ten — Out.'' “What’s that?” asked
amazed Royalty. “Well, sir.” said the Brig.,
“von forgot to salute those fellows, and that
is the Australian way of—er —expressing
disapproval.” “Oh, I’m sorry,” quoth the
youngster, and. turning, rode back to the
group and gravely saluted. As lie ambled
away the chorus rose again, but this time it
was: “Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one — In.” Thus honor was satis-
fied and all hands parted with mutual
respect.
Professor Rennie, of the Chair of Chem-
istry in Adelaide, has been made chairman
of the South Aus. section of the nebulous
Commonwealth Advisory Council for scien-
tific research. The other members are Har-
greaves, Director of Chemistry, . and the
practical George Brookman. who is presum-
ably to advise on financial points if they
ever arise. Rennie, educated in Sydney, has
held his professorship for over JO yeais. He
was the first, evidence of the tendency, which
Adelaide has since shown so strongly, to
choose its professors among the Australian-
born.
Is your country worth holding?
Are your rights not dear t.o you?
Your kils you should be folding ;
Don’t leave it to the few.
Is your home and kin not sacred?
Do you court the Hun’s decree?
You'll be surely underrated
If we can't depend on ye.
Oh, don’t stop to admire it. Come on. (Take
off your hat.)
Hark; the roar of guns and cannon!
Hear the whistling of the shell!
AYill you the suit of khaki don,
Feel the bump? Never mind —wove thrown
out some oil, and it may be smoother now.
And relieve them for a spell?
See the Medicoes and nurses,
Cutting, probing, bandaging,
Will you earn your comrades’ curses
Or their heartfelt cheering?
Would you rather part from those you love,
Or see them raped or slain ?
Wait till our boys in the sea they shove,
Plenty of time —don’t rush it —
Or wipe out the Kaiser’s stain.
Shall civilisation be submerged,
’Neath the heel of the tyrant’s foot?
Is it not time the world was purged
Of the law of lust and loot?
Perhaps we'd get on better if we sang it:—
Once again, I say, they’re calling!
You from mothers, sweethearts, home,
Won't you join them in the morning,
Sorry, but you’ll have to excuse Webster,
there; rhymes for “calling” are so difficult
Far across the wave and foam?
Better die while nobly fighting
For a cause both just and true,
Than live with a conscience sting
That should not belong to you.

Our experiment of a couple of years ago of taking
the wholesale catalogues of the great English Manu-

and deducting- 20 per cent., or 4/- in the £, from
their prices, was of a revolutionary character, and
might have landed us in heavy loss, but
IT DID NOT,

Best of all use both. If a preference exists for the Den-

form of cleanser is super-active and its occasional use
is the only perfect safeguard for the teeth.

Kept Growing, Scratched and

Horribly, Cuticura Healed.
Coledale, N. S. W. —“The rash from
which I suffered began in circles of pimples
on both legs and kept growing and becom-
ing more irritating each dhy, causing me to
scratch and rub them until they bled and
became very painful. They took on a
brownish hue and looked very much like
ringworms only much larger.
“At night I scratched them till they bled
and pained horribly. For over three months
this continued. I sent for a sample of the
Cuticura Soap and Ointment and bathed
the itching mass with hot water and Cuti-
cura Soap and afterwards applied the Oint-
ment. In less than three weeks I was
cured.” (Signed) Miss E. P. Annesley,

THIS instep-strap shoe has been specially
designed to look trim and dainty
beneath those delightfully feminine
frills and flounced hems that have
returned to vogue again. It is a particularly
pretty shoe, with a fine air of individuality
about it. The front part is patent leather,
and the back and strap are black flowered
brocade, set off by an attractive slide and
ornament of dull silver. The picture gives
some idea of the happiness of this combina-
tion, but the shoe itself is far more charm-
ing than the picture. Made in the dainty,
short-fronted shape and with that smart
Cuban heel which makes walking so comfort-
able, it reallv is a “find” in .the, way of
shoes. And ladies will see other and equally
delightful shoes in the latest Bostock ship-
ments, especially if they view them at once.

“Croson”: Every competent orchardist in
the Commonwealth is now beginning his
year’s spraying; 90 per cent, are using
motor-pumps for the purpose, and 99 per
cent, are exclaiming about the awful price
of petrol and benzine. Yet in Victoria and
Tasmania every big fruit-grower has wasted
enough alcohol —in the shape of damaged and
inferior fruit left in heaps to rot—to have
driven his little motor throughout the year.
It was much the same with potatoes, Turks’
caps, melons, etc. But the “encouragers of
Australian industries” had not provided for
this situation, so thousands of tons of raw
material were wasted; and the man who
uses petrol pays through the nose for his
own folly.

“Haka”: The employees of a big M.L.
firm of aerated-water manufacturers undergo
a medical exam, once a month, and the fact
has been trumpeted in the firm’s advts.,
which state that the products are poured into
clean bottles by clean men. Having read the
advt. and considered it, the Cordial Workers’
Union objected to the firm taking advantage
of its employees’ consent to submit to a medi-
cal exam, for the purpose of boosting its
goods, and as a result the advts. are to be
modified. The Cordial boys missed a chance;
they should have allowed the original advt.
to stand, and insisted on the additional
guarantee to the public that the directors
were treated regularly with sheep-dip.

Once again the Royal Society of Sydney
congressed at the old rooms in Phillip-street
to sleepily discuss the application of Science
to Industry; once again decisions of little
moment were arrived at; once again the sub-
ject was adjourned, to be resumed at a
future date in the same hopeless way. Once
again, too, H. G. Smith, chemist of the Syd-
ney Technological Museum, an unsupported,
neglected, solitary, enthusiastic apostle of
Australian bush-wealth from the Industrial
point of view, trotted out his well-loved
treatise on the utilisation of the valuable
extracts to be obtained from Australian
pines and eucalypts. He does this so often
that his listeners, knowing the subject well,
but lacking either enterprise or means, ur
both, listen like drugged owls. Walton,
chief chemist of the C.S.R., struck a good
note when in summing-up the Sydney Manu-
facturers’ ignorance of Sciences’ help, he
said that coal-consumption could be reduced
in all the Sydney factories if the manufac-
turers only knew what combustion meant.
Their ignorance of that economy shows that
Science and Industry in Australia have not
yet been introduced. When will the invita-
tions to the wedding be sent out?

“Vancemar”: “Merrigal’s” story of the
crude way in which our own black brothers
made their calculations (B. 29/6/T6) re-
minds me. Five years ago my business car-
ried me with miserable regularity to the
insignificant, sun-scorched South American
town of Aracataca, on the rusty Santa
Marta railway, Republic of Colombia.
Upon my first visit the usual wrinkled
native woman attended the demands of my
inner man at an inn with almuerza in the
shape of boiled rice, roast plantain, yuca
and a delicacy that tasted suspiciously like
fried iguana. The smiling black eyes of
the senorita daughter who placed the cow-
hide chair in position were like an oasis in
the wilderness, and so I continued my
patronage. The old dame booked up my
meals thus. Taking a bottle-shaped cala-
bash from the shelf she would tap me on
the shoulder and abruptly command “Fijase”
(“Take note”), at the same time dropping a
single grain of corn into the receptacle. It
represented one meal to me, and fifty pesos,
or half one dollar gold, to her. The joyful
day came when I would return no more and
I called for my account. Knowing the tally
to be 29 meals I counted fourteen and a half
dollars. The hostess, laboriously placed the
accumulated farm produce in a row two
deep on the table. She took the dollars,
placed each one opposite a grainy pair and
the odd 50 cents against the one unmated.
Her grunt said she had audited the boobs
and found them correct.

advance of the number of children born, and af£ei

est to fill the gap, it is still certain that in some cases
the Government is paying twice over, and m others
is paying for infants without taking delivery* as it

Hair troubles, like many other dis-
eases, have been wrongly diagnosed and
altogether misunderstood. The hair
itself is not the thing to be treated, for
the reason that it is simply a product of
the scalp, and wholly dependent upon
its action. The scalp is the very soil in
which the hair is produced, nurtured
and grown ; and it alone should receive
the attention if results are to be ex-
pected. It would do no' earthly good
to treat the stem of a pJant with a view
of making it grow and become more
beautiful —the soil in which the plant
grows must be attended’ to. Therefore
the scalp in which the hair grows must
receive the attention if you are to expect
it to grow and become more beautiful.
Loss of hair is caiased by the scalp
drying up, or losing it's supply of moist-
ure, or nutriment. When baldness
occurs the scalp lias simply lost all its
nourishment, leaving nothing for the
hair to feed upon (a plant, or even a
tree, would die under similar condi-
tions) .
The natural thing to do in either case
is to feed and replenish the soil or scalp,
as the case may be, and your crop will
grow and multiply as Xature intended
it should.
’ My True Hair Grower has a most
wonderful effect upon the hair glands
and tissues of the scalp. It is the only
remedy for the hair ever discovered that
is similar to the natural foods or liquids
of the scalp.
It penetrates the pores quickly, and
the hair soon shows the effects of its
wonderful, exhilarating and life-pro-
ducing qualities.
I am not an advertising quack, but
am a business man. My hair began to
grow thin the time I reached the age of
thirty. When I had reached the age of
thirty-five the top of my head was quite
bald. I had considerable pride, and

Dear Sir, —I am sure you will be interested to know that your True Hair Grower has
given me entire satisfaction. Not only has it stopped my hair from falling out, but it has
entirely cleared the head from Dandruff, and has improved the growth and thickness of
the hair. I also used your preparation, with excellent results, in the case of my daughter,
and to let vou see what extent her hair has improved, 1 am enclosing photograph of myself
and daughter, which 1 have just had taken. You are at liberty to use this in any way you
think fit. Thanking you.—l am, Yours very truly, D. FOWLES.
growth. I invested in every prepara-
tion. that I could see or hear of, and
here let me say that not only did I try
all the English so-called restorers but
those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting
cost me many sovereigns and consider-
able time —yet the hairs came not. I
had given up the idea of ever growing
hair again. One afternoon, while
enjoying a brief business respite by an
Alpine.trip, I fell in with an old col-
legiate chemist whose hair was particu-
larly plentiful. I jokingly remarked
that 1 wished he could spare some
of bis hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the
human hair as well as a good dentist
understands teeth. He wrote out a for-
mula, and suggested that I have a quan-
tity of the compound prepared. I did
this a few days later. I was astonished to
see the hair coining forth after several appli-
cations, and within six weeks my head was
covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of
hair. Since then the hair on my head has
been as luxuriant as when in my school days.
Having arranged for the legal right to do so,
I have for some time been privately selling
this marvellous liair-growing compound.
Besides being a true Hair Grower, my
preparation quickly removes DANDRUFF
and stops FALLING HAIR and ITCH-
ING. It is known the world owr, and I
have in my consulting rooms upwards of
<5OOO letters from grateful men and women
who have derived so much benefit from the
use of my True Hair Grower as to compel
them to write and thank me. Now, I do
not wish you to accept my word for any
statement I make, but want you to prove
the matter for yourself in your own home.

I have been using- Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery
during the last three
weeks, with most marvel-
lous results, and I have
decided that I would write
and tell you, for it was
not until this year that I
ever had occasion to try it.
For many years, each
winter I was troubled with
throat trouble or colds. I
used to always have a
recipe at the chemist’s that
was given to me by a
friend of mine. This always
seemed to help me a good
deal, and I thought it
was about as good as any-
thing I could get.
Unfortunately (as I
thought at the time) I lost
this recipe, and when I
had the misfortune to con-
tract a bad cold this year
which affected my voice
seriously, I could not find
this recipe, and I was re-
commended to try Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery
by a friend, who said she
had used it with great
success. I obtained a
bottle, and the effect was
marvellous. It is simply
astonishing how quickly it
helps one, for in less than
two days the cold was en-
tirely cured, and my voice
improved with the first
dose that I took. Needless
to say, I shall never bother
about getting any recipes
put up again, for New
Discovery shall always be
my remedy for a cold. I
think it marvellous.
Sincerely yours,

The Suicide.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS lonely as a solitary cow
Eating the grass of a forgotten hill
I went, with wrinkled heart ancl
sombre brow,
Striving my eager thought to calm and
still.
The world was wide, but narrow were the
ways,
And Elsie with a word had turned me
down.
I swore that not a she who walked in stays
Was worth the tinkle of a worn half-
crown.
She who had kissed me in the moonlit dusk
Till life became a gay and fevered dream
Winding by happy paths of rose and musk
To find its sustenance in pink ice-cream ;
She at the rustle of whose silken skirt
My soul had leaped to heights of warm
desire,
Whose sunny head had crushed my evening
shirt,
Sitting in silence while my veins throbbed
fire!
Elsie, the girl of golden girls for me,
The most expensive taste I ever had,
Had turned me down across a cup of tea
And laughed to see me drooping limp and
sad.
Oh, never had her lips worn brighter red
Than when they parted thus in cruel jest.
1 swore the heart within my breast was
dead—
Women were tedious torment at the best.
Alone, aloof I took my angry way
To where the bold cliff o’er the breakers
rose,
Where pocket handkerchiefs of yeasty spray
Seemed like white cambric at the world’s
cold nose.
Here some good ship was wrecked in former
years,
In the grim dark, when tempest held the
night,
And icy slanting rain like savage spears,
- Stabbing the wind, shut out the beacon’s
light.
Betrayed, betrayed by Elsie’s Judas kiss,
I viewed the place with wild and rolling
eye.
’Twere easy from a lofty crag like this
i To leap head-first into the sea and die.
To perish in one giddy plunge for love—
Oh, it were sweet the stern revenge to
take!
I thought of Elsie's haggard face above
Her morning tea and slabs of golden
cake.
To die? To end? Then I were rid for good
Of that small debt I owed for ties to
Brown.
I felt exactly in the soulful mood
In which a tragic hero ought to drown.
I looked aloft to the unheeding sky,
I looked upon the ragged rocks beneath.
Life was a gilded farce. I longed to die.
Here goes ! I reached the verge and set
my teeth.
Down, down, down, down. The rush
through singing air
Was most exhilarating as I fell.
I laughed aloud, so little did I care;
The sea rushed upward with a briny smell,
Caught me, embraced me, dragged me far
below
Amid the little fish with silver fins
That darted from me in a shining row
As if pursued by death and all their sins.
I went down half a mile or so, I think ;
The water was as soft as carded wool’.
It seemed as if I took one long deep drink
Of something not exactly iced but cool.
And then I felt myself turn round and rise,
And lack of air oppressed my upward
way.
My lungs seemed bursting ere I saw the
skies
And felt myself afloat upon the bay.
I was not dead. I did not even feel
l like dying as I swam around,
ivlsie . The name had not the least appeal;
It tasted much like any other sound.
My suicide was not a great success.
I turned about :i,iid started for the shore;
And like a shipwrecked sailor in distress
I eyed the sodden garments that I wore.
My shirt and collar still might be all right,
My coat and pants were ruined past repair.
It was a costly ending to delight—-
And Elsie never knew and didn’t care!
But as I reached the little, sunny bay,
Just fifty yards from where I made my
dive,
Luck with a sudden kindness looked my
way—
I saw the very finest girl alive.
I swam right in and fainted at her feet;
An introduction she could not denv.
Ao girl who looked one half as kind and
sweet
Could let a lialf-drowned person lightly
die.
She tried first-aid ; and slowly I came round,
Breathed heavily and gazed upon her
face—
E!sie! The dimpled maid that I had found
Has throned at once in her deserted
place!
Mabel f a “d 1 h ave proved the world quite
A useful horse paid Brown the bill I
owed;
Ripe kisses in warm dusks we lightly share
An gh in * | lcecieams on hapny nights are

W e go by ferry steamers to and fro.
ISo simple joy, if cheap, we seek to shun ;
And Mabel loves me—she has told me so.
But if my heart to new disaster fell

STANLEY GUTH-
j HIE, <>f the Star of Torres —known
throughout the Coral Sea and up to the
Thousand Islands of the Philippines as Star-
board Light, lounged over the rail of the
ship looking down at the crowded docks of
Kowloon. He was called Starboard Light,
not because any story attached to a color
blindness or a preference of green for red in
navigation, but because, being ordinarily a
temperate man, he had on occasion been
known to paint, not red, but green, certain
towns, ports and crazy wharves at the end
of mangroved channels. And the green
paint with which ChieLofficer Stanley
Guthrie painted such fag-ends of creation
withal was creme de menthc, in long-
necked, fat-bellied, green bottles that never
paid duty if Guthrie was to drink of them.
And now Starboard Light’s name was
being rapidly forgotten ; for he had painted
nothing green for more than a year. Which
is to say that during that year Starboard
Light had got him a girl and he wanted
her name to be Mrs. Captain Guthrie, and
not Madame Chief-officer Creme de Menthc.
She was a Sydney-sider girl, pretty faced
and frivolous, but as high as his heart,
shapely as Venus from the sea, and full-
bosomed like a matron by reason of many
hours of daily surfing in the Pacific; for
every dawn she and Bondi or Coogee
Beaches met the sun in company.
With his ever-present need of the
girl—Enid the deep-breasted siren of
the beaches—he became as resourceful at
finding new ways of revenue—or rather of
listening to the new ways when proposed to
him instead of following his old careless
habit of laughing away the offers of bribes.
He had run opium to Australia, once suc-
cessfully and once with so little margin to
spare that he was nearly caught with the
goods on him and did not get a penny from
the Chinaman who had only received the
little cargo of poppy juice a few minutes
before lie was arrested. He had smuggled
four Chinamen into the Commonwealth at
& profit of £SO a head to himself, and for the
Chinese of an entry into a paradise of high
wages and plenty—a paradise doubly desir-
able because the Aliens Exclusion Act says
that no colored man shall enter Australia
even if the camel performs the impossible,
a iffi passes through the needle’s eye.
The £3OO accruing from these two suc-
cessful smugglings of Chinese and opium
lie had, with the trustfulness of the
simple man in anything he idealises,
handed to Enid Bartlett, his Venus of the
surf; and Enid, being a very hard-headed
Australian with a proper appreciation of
money value—yet quite unmercenary—had
made the first payment on a cottage and let
it at a good rental, so that the nest might
earn money towards paying for itself before
the birds arrived.
And now Guthrie was out for a really big
profit, with nobody to share it but the first
and second engineers, and, if unavoidable, two
firemen and the second mate to the extent of
a small rake-off. The participation of the
engineers could not be avoided, for the 50
Chinese to be smuggled would have to be
carried in the bunkers, in the aggravated
lurkish bath over the boilers, or in the coal
cargo of the forehold built into the coal. The
fees for running were £SO a head. Guthrie
thought of his lion’s share of the £2500
payable half in Hong Kong and half at
fcydney and smiled in appreciation of his
earnings.
Across the bay from the Canton landing
came two sampans—unnoticed in the hun-
dreds of unlighted craft. But this was not
the place to fear, for the British Government
at Hong Kong cares less than nothing how
tar the Australian law against aliens be
broken; and Guthrie, watching the black
masses ot the sampans impelled across the
glassy water, and scarcely causing a ripple
under their sweeps, felt anxious for the first
time with the dull knowledge at the pit of
Ills stomach that the anxiety must swell and
almost overwhelm him until he had deliv-
ered the freight. The half-human cattle
from Canton climbed silently up the rope
ladder to the well-deck and were distributed
in the bunkers and the forehold. At the
first streak of dawn the Star of Torres
hauled on her after-spring and went astern
out of the dock, swung to starboard and
dropped down the harbor past Lyee Moon;
and so, dodging the great, blundering mat-
saffed junks, to sea. Thus began the adven-
ture of Starboard Light and the Fifty Pongs
of Honam.
The Star of Torres called at Manila; then
Lntain and passed down to Samarai.
. e *ifty Pongs of Honam breathed baked-
au- and coal-dust and the smells of the
tropics that sicken when the breathing ele-
m™t is confined. They kept life going with
a little rice and such scraps as their fellow-
Giiinese, the firemen, brought them. The
cockroaches walked over them with serrated
leet m the everlasting darkness of night and
day and they endured as only the Chinese
m d iT‘ e T in i U r V ? ted t 0 a]l bodily discomfort
by the hard labor and half starvation of cen-
turies that seem also to have given them
immunity from disease.
. At N ew Britain the Star of Torres took
m much copra of Herbertshoe and Rabaul;
and in the holds the steaming heat developed
the copra bugs in a night and gave them
wings. So to the breathlessness below decks
were added the torture of the copra bugs
and cockroaches and all the other insect
horrors that came aboard with the island
cargoes. Yet never did those stolid, lymph-.

It Should Never be Forgotten that Stabbing or Dull Pain in the Back,
Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Gravel, Dropsy, are all the Result
of Weak or Diseased Kidneys.
The clanger of a wreck begins
immediately the vessel springs a
leak, and then is the easiest time,
the right time, the safest time, to
safeguard the ship from being-
wrecked. The danger of Bright’s
disease, dropsy, diabetes and other
fatal kidney disorders begins imme-
diately there is any sign of kidney
complaint—backache, dizzy spells,
urinary disorders, sediment, gravel,
impure blood, pains in the loins and
sides, puffy eyelids, swollen ankles,
etc. The easiest time, the right
time, the only safe time to protect
yourself against fatal kidney com-
plications is when the first signs
appear, for kidney complaint comes
on unnoticed, and it is bound to end
fatally 7 if neglected. Take no risks
with your health, but begin with
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills at
the first sign of anything wrong.
Doan’s Pills are a special medicine
and a sure cure for every disorder
of the kidneys or connective system.
But you must be careful to get the
genuine Doan’s Backache Kidney-
Pills.
BACKACHE AND KIDNEY TEODBLE
CURED.
SYDNEY WOMAN SPEAKS.
Mrs. Chas. Clii. 38 Wellington StreVt,
Waterloo, Sydney says“ln common
with many others, I have nothing but
good to say of Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills. This remedy cured me of a bad
attack of kidney trouble of long stand-
ing some six months ago, and I have
had no return since. Before I took these
Pills I was suffering a lot with my back,
the pain at times being almost unbear-
able. I could not stoop or move freely,
and always felt tired and had no energy.
The secretions were affected, being thick
and cloudy, with a red sediment, and I
had dropsical swellings on my legs and
ankles. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
were one day brought under my notice,
and I sent for a bottle. They gave me
relief almost at once, so I persevered with
the remedy until I was quite cured, using
in all four bottles. I cannot speak too
highly of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and recommend them with every confi-
dence to other sufferers.”
Two years later Mrs. Clift says“l
have had no reason to alter my good
ornnion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
They cured me over two years ago, and
I am still well. I always keep them in
the house and take a dose now and then,
just as a preventive against any return.”
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
sold by all Chemists and Stores at
2/9 per bottle, or posted by
Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt
Street, Sydney.

PILLS
CURES BY DOAN’S OINTfIENT.
ITCHING PILES.
Mr. James Rees, 31 Lower Campbell
Street, Surry Hills, Sydney, says“ Five
years ago Doan’s Ointment cured me of
a very bad attack of Itching Piles, and I
have been free of that distressing com-
.plaint ever since. Before I got this
Ointment I tried several remedies, but
none of them- gave me so much as relief
from my suffering. The pain and irrita-
tion I had to endure were awful, and
sometimes I was so bad that I felt 1
could nearly tear myself to pieces. i
heard of Doan’s Ointment being good tor
piles, so got some, using it with very
pleasing results. The first few applica-
tions relieved the irritation a good deal
and before I had finished one pot I was
quite cured. 1 always keep Doan s Oint-
ment in the house, and use it occasionally
just as a preventive against any return
of Piles.”
IRRITATING RASH.
Mrs. A. Miller. 3 Knight Street,
Erskineville, Sydney, says“ For a long
time I suffered with a nasty rash on my
arm, which was not only disagreeable, but
also very painful. It seemed worse after
having mv hands in water, then it would
burn. This rash resembled Eczema, and
I was very worried about it, and anxious
to get a cure. I tried every remedy I
could hear of. but nothing did me any
good. After using Doan’s Ointment for a
day or so, I was pleased to find I had at
last got something good. It gave me re-
lief very quickly, and a short treatment
cured me. I say haired,’ for it is twelve
months since I used Doan’s Ointment, and
I have been quite free of the rash all
that time.”
Seven years later Mrs. Miller confirms
the above bv saying:—“l have been per-
fectly free of that irritating rash since
Doan’s Ointment cured me over eight
years ago.”

the cargo, and ready to count the secret
commission as already earned and paid.
At Samarai there was a wireless for
i in posted on from Port Moresby, a wire-
less saying -that his girl Enid had made the
northern voyage with her mother and would
wait at Cooktown to return by her fiance’s
ship. He thought no more then of the
cattle in the bunkers and the hold; he
scarcely noticed the passenger, a young man
named Howartli, a consciously smart man
with waster writ large upon him.
Across the Coral Sea to Cooktown the
Fifty Pongs of Honam felt the voyage most
horribly. Dead calm except for occasional
puffs of decaying vegetation from the land,
the bad breath of vegetable corruption,
marked the changing of the monsoon. But
Starboard Light, resting in liis cabin with
the electric fan on its second speed, thought
of Enid and never of the weather; and in
his watch upon the bridge scarcely saw the
heated stale purple sea below him sluggishly
breaking along the vessel’s run, caring only
that over at Cooktown, under the mountain
and beyond the rice white of the Barrier
Beef. Enid, the surf girl, waited for him
under the poncianas and the palms.
She came aboard as soon as the Star of
Torres had tied up, walked swiftly up to
Starboard Light, who met her more than
half-way, and half-shyly and with the
coquetry of a bride accepted his kiss. Star-
board Light took Enid and her mother to
the music-room and got them tea, listened
worshippingly to the girl’s description of
her purchases of the lovebird’s nest; and
when he had to leave her for the work of
the ship in its short stay in the port and to
farewell the Customs officers, she sent him
awav happy by objecting to his departure.
He heard her at the piano as he went
on deck, and blessed her for all she was —
and for much that she was not.
By thq coaming of the engine-room hatch
stood the chief engineer, his co-partner in
the smuggling of the Fifty Pongs, and he was
a grave man. He had to say that the Cus-
toms intended a big search of the ship at
Townsville —a search for opium. And if
they raked the ship with a fine-toothed
comb for opium might not an alien of Can-
ton stick between the teeth, and so be dis-
covered? _
Starboard Light saw the danger too. Two
thousand five hundred pounds’ worth ot
Pongs at Sydney to become a loss and a
menace. of' gaol to the losers if discovered
north of Brisbane —that was too terrible to
think of. In danger he thought quickly—
as quickly as a rat with a terrier in pursuit.
“She’s flying fairly light in this dead
calm. Mac,” he said to the engineer. 1 Soon s
we get to sea off with the manhole ot the
starboard after-tank and put them down
there.” ,
“Man! ’twill be like ridin’ in a smelter.”
“It won’t be for long—they can come out
as soon’s we’re clear of Townsville we 11
be only two or three hours there.”
So the engineer agreed, stipulating only
that the change to the tank should not be
made until the ship was well past Lucinda
Point —to make the suffering of the fifty
aliens as small as might be.
As the ship made ready to go to sea again
Chief-officer Guthrie saw Enid for a
moment; but anew Enid —radiant, when
before she had been calm, splendid with
hope where he had left her merely a quiet
acceptor of life, blushing where before she
had shown the equable color of a honey
blonde. She was talking to Howartli, the
waster passenger from Samarai. Starboard
Light doffed his cap to them and passed on
to his work on the fo’c’s’le head.
At the southern exit of Hinchinbrook the
smugglers took their fifty men down to the
manhole of the starboard after-tank. The
black interior made the Chinese falter a
moment; but there were no cockroaches
down there nor coaldust to breathe, and
Australia the Happy was so near that they
knew they were coasting it. With then-
poor belongings and their food they lowered
themselves into the living, windless grave.
The manhole cover was left ready to clap on
during the visit of the Customs officers; and
the Star of Torres anchored at noon by
Magnetic Island. Then the manhole cover
was put on. And then the second engineer,
who had been ill of something like ptomaine
poisoning for twenty-four hours, became ill
enough to be forced to the hospital ashore.
The Customs’ examination gave the con-
spirators anxiety; it was protracted, and
they were glad to be at sea again and lift
the cover. And then, as the engineer w r as
about to bring the fifty men out of the tank,
instruction was brought to him from Star-
board Light.
“Leave them he a bit, said he. The
Customs are suspicious; they’ve sent two
men on the ship as far as Mack ay.”
So the engineer sent down food and
water and counselled the fifty to lie close.
At Mackay the ship stayed but an hour
for a tender. Starboard Light, after a very
constrained flirtation with his girl, who
seemed to devote more time to Ilowarth the
passenger than to the chief officer, turned
in at midnight to sleep in readiness for his
watch at four o’clock. His place was taken
bv Howartli. The girl for whom Starboard
Light had smuggled the Fifty Pongs of
Honam put her head on the re-found waster’s
shoulder and murmured something about
having to “tell poor Guthrie soon.” Guthrie,
having impressed on the engineer the
urgency of releasing the men in the tank,
turned in and slept, despite a fear that
settled upon him like a fog upon the sea.
The engineer, who could take none into his
counsels, deferred the visit to the after-tank
because he felt suddenly ill. He sent to the
steward for brandy; and as half an hour
more or less could not matter, he deferred
the liberation of the Chinese until he could
recover, and went to his cabin, leaving the
j bird engineer, now acting-second, in charge.
The shiii’s doctor diagnosed the chief
engineer’s trouble as similar to tnat of the
second; and the agony being great, he in-
jected sufficient morphia to put the intelli-
gence of two men off duty and left him in a
half-sleep, knowing nothing of the smuggled
men of Honam. , . ,
Away from the lee of Flattop Island the
Star of Torres ran into fresh seas after her
long knowledge of an ocean flat as treacle. The
ship's stern rose lightly on the waves that
increased in height as the wind blew towards
half a gale. The captain, awakening, went
to the chart-room and called to the second
officer on the bridge to order the after-tanks
to be filled; and the order was transmitted
to tlie engine-room and accepted as a matter
of course. The pumps started throwing
torrents of water into the tanks; the men
of Honam, who had endured so much to. find
the Promised Land, felt and heard the liquid
death pouring in from the dark. They
screamed curses, tearing at each other’s
faces in the moving darkness. The
motion of the ship became easier as the
tanks filled with their liquid ballast; their
cries and poundings at the walls, unheard
without, became inaudible to themselves
as the water rose; the last bubble lifted to
the surface of the water and wms then com-
pressed against the roof of steel; the smug-
gled men of Pearl River, all their endurance
passed, had found peace for their reward.
Starboard Light, smiling in his dreams of
Enid and a home upon an even keel, sud-
denly awakened to a knowledge that the
even keel of the last two weeks had changed
to lumpiness. He awoke and listened to the
battering of the seas and felt the ship
deeper in the water. The engineer had
released the men, then, and filled the tanks.
Their luck stuck to them j~ he could not have
had much time. Starboard Light turned
over and slept again.
At four o’clock Starboard Light took the
watch, saw that the filling of the tanks and
the time thereof had been duly logged and
felt good. And as the second went off the
bridge he mentioned that the chief engi-
neer seemed to have the same trouble that
had made his subordinate land at Townsville
and that they had had to put him to sleep
with morphia. Then Starboard Light broke
into a cold sweat. He asked the man he was
relieving to stand by for a minute or two
and ran to wake the chief engineer. Ten
minutes later he knew that the smuggled
men were for ever accounted for; and at
that lie staggered back to the bridge afraid
to cry out, but calling to his own soul that
he was a murderer.
So he fared down the coast across the
lumpy seas with horror, fear and despair
raging in liis soul, calling out to his easily-
sleeping conscience to scourge him -con-
science which is remorse and ever widest
awake in the fear of detection.
There could be no peace ahead. Sooner
or later the tanks must be pumped out; a
heavy cargo might be theirs at Sydney, and
water ballast aft unnecessary. A collision at
any moment might strain a plate or buckle
an angle iron in the tank; and then repairs,
and that lifted manhole and inquiry and
some traitor arising where most unexpected;
and then, detection and punishment.
The sun arose foggily at his left hand, the
sea mist curled low upon the water and flat-
tened the waves; the day was as haggard
as tlie man. What could be done? Bear
it even to the breaking strain, to cold-
bloodrly determine to brazen it all out and
deny everything, to prosecute for slander
any white man who squealed, to sandbag
and dump overboard any coolie who told the
truth to implicate him? He could not bring
himself to such things. This, terrible act had
been involuntary; but neither could he
bring himself to forget the horror of the
death of the fifty men in their iron grave.
For he had an imagination; which is to have
sl conscience.
A flat island came sprawling out of the
mist a mile ahead —a long whaleback of
rock with the seafog curling above it.
Guthrie looked at the compass and saw that
the coolie steersman had let the ship off her
course. Professional habit made him forget
his ghosts for a moment: he gave the
Chinese helmsman a curt order “Port a
little.”
Then he ran down the bridge companion,
entered the chartroom and hurriedly glanced
at the chart. As he walked back to the
bridge his ghosts came back to him.. The
agonised man, feeling like the convict in the
condemned cell, looked along tlie run of white
decks and state-rooms, and thought of Enid.
And then he saw her leave her cabin, fully
dressed at this early hour, run aft to a state-
room five doors removed and tap upon the
door. Guthrie drew back into the chart-
room, but immediately looked out cautiously
again.
And he saw Howarth, the waster passen-
ger from Samarai, come from his state-
room : saw them kiss and go aft together
Enid clinging to Howarth’s arm, and look-
ing up at him adoringly.
Guthrie ran up the bridge companion and
saw the whale-backed rock near and the ship
falling away towards it and to starboard.
“Port a little,” he said; and then in a
flash saw how to lqy his company of ghosts.
The way on her would take the Star of
Torres half on to the rock, she would break
'her back, and the after part would slide
into deep water.
“Starboard your helm ! Starb’d !’’
The Chinese steersman, without imagina-
tion or appreciation of danger, spun the
wheel over. Starboard Light, mad with his
own deed and his fifty hidden ghosts and
the memory of the treachery of her for whom
his criminal error had been chanced, braced
himself involuntarily for the shock.
It came in a rending of metal, a tremen-
dous impact, and then a sudden stoppage of
motion and the entrance of the sea. But
the way had carried her far enough to save
the afterpart from sinking. The ship for-
ward by the bridge passed over tlie rock,
broke off like a snapped carrot and sank in
deep water. A jagged rock ripped the side
wide open; where the after-tank had
been was a tunnel, and from it floated
bodies of men once of Honam and adven-
turers of the Blessed Isles. At that sight
Starboard Light, thrown into the water by
the shock, but swimming vigorously, cried
out loudly, threw up his hands and sank
like a stone.
* * * *
“He loved me, too,” said Enid, the Surf
Girl, as she read the newspaper apprecia-
tion of the noble seaman Avho, finding his
fault of navigation, had given his life in
expiation of the error that lost the Star of
Torres. ,
Then Enid cried a little and 'phoned to
Howarth, the waster of Samarai.
