Compare the factory performance of “Mangrovite" with
that of any other variety. It invariably lasts longer, gives
more efficient service and is more economical with power.
This is the result of the special methods of tanning employed
by the manufacturers, which ensure the durability, strength
and elasticity of their product and eliminate the necessity
for constant delays for repairs and replacements.

THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Being- destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states: —“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result is
lately to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Eumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bac-
tericidally as is creosote.”

The Red Page
The Book of Australia
Judged , by the first of its two volumes
The Australian Encyclopaedia (Sydney:
Angus and Robertson, Ltd.) easily takes
rank as the best review of the Common-
wealth in its past and present tenses that
has appeared or is likely to appear within
the life of this generation; in some respects
it is so good that there is never likely to
be a better. For many years the firm which
has undertaken its compilation has been the
leading collector and publisher of Austra-
liana, and this work —the second part is to
appear about the end of the year—is a fine
climax to a series of ventures of which any
house with a public of only five or six mil-
lions might well be proud. The present half
runs from A to Lys / and history, geography,
geology, botany, vital statistics, ornithology,
politics, sport, biography—indeed, anything
that is known,of this continent, both before
the British came here and since—have been so
well handled as to make it seem possible that
there can never again remain any ignorance
of Australia, up to the date of this publica-
tion, wherever it may circulate. No library
can do without it, and no Australian should
fail to make himself acquainted with it. Its
preparation is said to have cost £15,000, and
although that is a lot of money, no one who
studies it can doubt that this considerable
fortune has been wisely invested, at any rate
from the point of view of such as desire to
know about the world we live in.
If the first thing requisite to be known
of a continent is its history—and there is
no history more difficult to grasp than that
of one which lay outside the ken of more or
less civilised humanity until hardly more
than three centuries ago—two brilliant
articles, written by four men than whom
there are none with greater knowledge of
their respective subjects, stand before all
other contributions from the distinguished
list of writers who have aided in putting the
book together. Professor T. W. E. David
and Professor Cotton have written some 20
pages—about 24,000 words —under the head-
ing of Geology, which would make a text-
book easily worth separate publication. And
Professor Baldwin Spencer, assisted by Dr.
Ramsay Smith, has contributed nearly as
long a section dealing with the Australian
aborigines—who, “with the exception of one
or two isolated groups in other parts of the
w0r1d.... represent the most archaic people
extant, and, in many respects, reveal the
conditions under which the early ancestors
of the human race existed.” No one, after
reading these two fascinating essays, could
regard this large island as being in any
sense a newcomer amongst the lands that
emerge at present above the surface of the
oceans. These two sections, read in con-
junction with the 23 pages of Professor
Griffith Taylor dealing with Economic Geo-
graphy, would perhaps give any intelligent
reader who had never before heard of Aus-
tralia a better idea of the main facts relat-
ing to it than anything else in the book—
and that may be an excuse for singling them
out here from so much that is highly valu-
able to all who seek to study this country.
There arc 86 named contributors to this
volume, exclusive of the editors, A. W. Jose
and H. J. Carter, but altogether it contains
nearly 1300 separate headings, some of which
are, of course, referred to others. The list
of contributors in itself well supplies an
understanding of what expert knowledge in
the widest variety of subjects is at the read-
er’s command. It is impossible to mention
more than a fraction of them here, but the
names of C. A. Sussmilch, Christopher Bren-
nan. Charles Hedley, Ernest Scott, G. 11.
Knibbs, Griffith Taylor, John Sulmau, Pietro
Baracchi. T. C. Roughley, T. G. Tucker, T.
W. E. David. William Haswell, Baldwin
Spencer and Walter Jeffery may well stand
as representative in this connection.
One of the finest features of the publica-
tion is the quality of its illustrations, maps
and diagrams. Nothing better than its
colored plates has been done in Australia, or,
for that matter, anywhere else. They range
between Fishes, Birds’ Eggs, Algae, Butter-
flies, Moths. Beetles, Lizards, Snakes, Frogs
and the North Sea tracks of H.M.A.S. Aus-
tralia during the Great War. Twenty-seven
full plates ornament the volume, and pos-
sibly an average of every fifth page Carries
its informative illustration in black-and-
white. The track chart of the, Australia will
come as a surprise to many who were un-
aware that during 1915-16-17-18. when she
was on active service between Britain and
the Baltic, she steamed 56,908 miles, whilst
during the whole war she covered 95,000 —
surely earning her keep and a better fate
than befcl her in April of last year. Four
most interesting photographs, having to do
with the work which he gave so generously
to the world, illustrate the late Lawrence
Hargrave’s great part in the pioneering of
aviation. It is good to find in the article
itself that high appreciation which is his
desert and has been so lavishly afforded him
by all but his fellow-countrymen.
This is a history of prehistoric Australia,
of its discovery and of British settlement
within its coastlines. It is within certain
limits a dictionary of national biography and
(within larger limits) of scientific obser-
vation. It gives all that is picturesque and
much that is noble in our story, and is truth-
ful about the sordidness of some features of
our early days without being morbid or un-
just.

Those Stage Tricks
It will, I think, scarcely be denied that
even the constant theatregoer knows very
little about what is called “stage
tion,” and that the man in the street is in-
terested in the subject not at all. Their
opinions on the matter, one way or the other,
would be valueless, anyhow. But the writer
of “Concerning Stage (R.P.'
13/8/’25) is not an ordinary theatregoer,
neither can one visualise him as a type of
the man in the street. Rather is he the man
in the study, who, diligently reading all there
is to be read of the progress of the contem-
porary stage, and thereby acquiring a little
second-hand technical knowledge, periodically
lifts up Ms voice in lamentation, crying out
that everything on our boards is as bad as
bad can be; that irrevocably, at long last,
the drama is going to the demnition bow-
wows.
I want to do Mr. Esson justice. He is, uo
doubt, an enthusiast, and he takes Mrnself
very seriously. He would, I imagine, like to
be thought a devout lover of the dramatic
art. But surely never was there one who
dissembled so effectually his love; never a
dissembler who so frequently kicked the ob-
ject of his affection downstairs! Not so long
ago it was the “well-made play” that called
forth his derision and contempt. Now it is
the turn of the producers of plays. Not all
producers, but various unnamed “so-called
producers,” who are, it appears, full of no-
thing but “stage-tricks,” and responsible for
“tawdry devices,” “out-worn conventions,”
and, again, “petty little tricks,” all and
every one of which vex Mr. Esson’s artistic
soul and cause liim to write, in extraordi-
narily over-stressed terms, in their dispraise,
not to say denunciation.
It is not easy to see to what address the
latest diatribe is directed. If its writer hurls
his shafts at the producers of the Australian
stage he has badly missed his mark. For few
■ original plays, as Mr. Esson should know,
are presented in this country. Wherefore the
local producer—a quite capable and not
entirely unintellectual artist, if I may be
allowed to appraise him—-is rarely called
upon to exercise his inventive powers. The
MS. of the play it is his business to get
ready arrives here, as a general rule, care-
fully and copiously marked with the perfected
stage directions of the original producer,
approved by the author in England or
America, where most of our plays come from.
It is obvious, then, that Mr. Esson’s ridicule
of stage “effects that people would not toler-
ate in a book” will leave the local producers’
withers unwrung. “Take any scene,” de-
claims our critic, “say one between a hus-
band and wife, and consider how it is rend-
ered on the stage.” No word is vouchsafed
by him as to the nature of the scene, or,
what is most important, what the couple
talk about. However, Mr. Esson tells us
that the husband stands right, the wife left,
and that after about a minute they cross,
"for no reason except to change their posi-
tion.” After another minute it is time for
another cross, and “in a five-minute scene
the duet becomes as exciting as a game of
hide-and-seek.” I should think it would in-
deed. And this extraordinary entertainment
occurs through the bungling of his job by
the present-day producer! Frankly, I can’t
believe it. In Ibsen’s phrase, “People don’t
do such things” in plays nowadays.
But, accepting the indictment for a
moment as a true bill, I would like to put
a question to Mr. Esson. How would he
propose to better the crude stage-management
of that quite simple scene? He does not say.
The Sphinx is silent. Enough for him to
sneer in his superior way at what I sup-
pose he labels a “tawdry device” of the stage.
His criticism —lover of the drama though he
be—is destructive, not helpful. Would he,
I wonder, have the husband and wife play
the scene —it quite deserves the name, for,
observe, it lasts five solid minutes! —holding
the same positions, motionless, inactive, dur-
ing the whole of the dialogue? It would
appear that such would be Mr. Esson’s
method. And if that be so, what sort of
audience would put up with such a deadly,
unreal interlude?
If Mr. Esson should ever attend a rehear-
sal of such a scene at any of our theatres he
will be surprised to hear, as I have heard
on many occasions, the following scrap of
unrehearsed dialogue between stage-director
and actor: Stage-director: “Why that
cross?” Actor: “It’s the author’s idea, I
suppose—it’s marked in the part.” Stage-
director (abruptly) : “It’s quite unnecessary,
I think. Cut it out.”
So much for Australia. Maybe—who can
tell?—it is England Mr. Esson is gibing at.
But why? A play, “The Cherry Orchard,”
by his beloved Tchekhov (of Avhich author
I speak with the utmost respect), is at this
moment running at a London West End
theatre. Likewise most of the “great” pro-
ducers jhe cites are both well known and well
appreciated on the London stage, though
some of them—Bernard Shaw and W. B.
Yeats, for example—would hardly he accorded
the title of “producers” there. Mr. Shaw
certainly has never claimed or announced
that he was the veritable “producer” of any
of his pieces. His suggestions would un-
doubtedly be invaluable at rehearsals, but
the technical exposition of them would natu-
rally be left to his experienced stage-director.
John Driukwater, the son of a professional
actor (I have appeared in the same cast
with him), was himself on the stage for some
time, as, of course, was Granville Barker.
Both these distinguished playwrights are,
through that early training and knowledge
of technique acquired, expert at stage-direc-
tion, as all the world knows. Who, then,
are the disastrous professors of the art, those
purveyors of stale “tricks of the trade,”
those charlatans whose “effects are usually
false”? Who and where are they? Also,
what precisely are the so-called tricks?
Would Mr. Esson, for instance, call the
many stage effects to bo noted in Bernard
Shaw’s “Saint! Joan” (the author’s best-
constructed and most successful play to date)
“stage tricks”? If not, what does he mean
by the term? Apart from one queer instance
he gives us nothing to go upon.
Vague accusations and Mgh-falutin denun-
ciations lead nowhere. Let us have some
concrete examples of what our critic objects
to, and let us see ho*w, under expert advice
and direction, we can better them. Then
we shall get along. But if Mr. Esson does

Anglicising Latin
The question of Latin pronunciation raised
and crushed by “Obfuscus” (ILl’. •>O/7/ _o)
is one of rather painful interest to any
teacher of languages, dead or living. Latin,
to say nothing of Greek, is taught m such very
small doses nowadays that every dose must
be made strongly nutritious. There is no
time to tell a class that there are two pos-
sible ways of pronouncing a language: one
can be thankful if any consistent pronuncia-
tion is mastered and the words efficiently
handled. Well, then, which shall it be, an
English Latin or a European Latin i Is
Latin to be taught as a language so drearily
dead that it can only be handled with the

he treated as an honored progenitor whose
habits and ways are traditionally known t
Putting it practically, is the pronunciation
to be according to the English vowel scheme,
using the five vowels as in bake, beat, bind,
bowl, brute; or according to the Continental
five, bah, bay, bee, boh, bull? Consonants
come into the matter, too, of course, but they
follow naturally, once the vowels are con-
ceded.
“For unremembered years,” says "Obfus-
cus,” “the English have pronounced their
Latin as it was spelt.” What exactly did
that mean? Has it meant the same all
along? Hardly! How did Shakspeare speak
when he pronounced his English as it was
spelt? For one thing, the vowel sound in
the present Southern English pronunciation
of but is hardly 200 years old. It is certain
that in Shakspeare’s day but rhymed with
pat. Therefore Shakspeare, in pronouncing
his “small Latin.” would have pronounced
“Augustus” in a way that “Obfuscus” would
write down as “Owgoostoosss.” Yes, really
he would have said it so. pronouncing it as it
was spelt.- As for making the first syllable
ow instead of the modern aw, that is natu-
ral enough, not because of some slavish idea
of following modern Italian, but because of
the general vowel scheme of Continental lan-
guages. An is a diphthong made up of the
first and last of the five vowels, ah and oo
crushed together. If you doubt it, read what
the dog says in Aristophanes— an, an! Did
any dog in any language ever say a vowel
that was not the diphthong we write down
to-day as ow? Obviously in Greek and Latin
au was “pronounced as it was spelt.”
The question to me is this. When I teach
children French or German or some other
living language, I invite them to plunge into
flie stream of the language, and to forget as
far as possible their English range of sounds.
In teaching a dead language, this is not pos-
sible to the same degree, as the last finesse
of rhythm and accent has been lost. A com-
promise is necessary ; but at least one need
not lead children to believe that Latin is a
language made in England during the last
two centuries or so, and that everyone who
speaks Latin on the Continent speaks it
wrong! When the brilliaent and youthful
John Milton roamed through Italy in 1630
or so, meeting learned men in disputation,
the Latin he used must have been understood
by scholars everywhere. This would not be
so if an English Latinist of the nineteenth-
century style took MiltonTs place. Latin is
of course no longer used as a lingua franca
except by certain internationals like the
Jesuits, but its uses over a long past must
not be forgotten.
As for the matter of derivation, it is cer-
tainly important, as “Obfuscus” says, to
show that verb does come from the Latin
rerbum. Granted that the neo-Latinists do
pronounce this werbum, still any class is
interested to glance at an old book and see
how that change could arise. Faerie Qveene.
How the U and the V have diddled each other
during the centuries, like the superfluous C
and the dogmatic G! But there are other
matters of derivation, not to be explained
except by abandoning the insular scheme of
pronunciation with adl its accumulation of
accidents. Take, as “Obfuscus” does, that
name “Caesar.” Examine its history, involv-
ing the development of the words “Kaiser”
and “Czar.” How r could “Kaiser” be die
counterpart of “Caesar” if “Seezer” had orig-
inally been the real phonetic value of the
name? As for the charge of inconsistency,
in that the neo-Latiners still mention Julius
Caesar in the English pronunciation, what
else could they do in an English sentence?
In reading a pasage of Latin, on the other
hand, they would let the sjounds of .that name
agree with the other words. In the same
way we say, “I have beten to Paris,” pro-
nouncing it like the son of Priam, keeping
our consistent French pronunciation! for the
time when we are making a French sentence.
Of course some people who with a smat-
tering of knowledge seem to rejoice in kick-
ing the alphabet about a,re very unpleasant
to watch ; but, on the whole, the neo-Latiners
are the real old-Latiners. For one thing they
have a care for quantity, on which the
rhythm of all Latin varse and evean prose
depends. It is not cantankerous and fussy
to insist that the vowel o in bonus and locus
is short: how can anyone quote a hexameter
in Parliament or before a learned Judgje
without first safeguarding its rhythm?
Indeed, it was the English Latiners erf
recent centuries, with their “Armah vaer-
umque kaino,” who were the real false inno-
vators. Whatever accident had happened to
English they included in their pronunciation
of Latin ! That was all. They pronounced
vent, vidi, vici as it was spelt, producing*
something that Julius Cajsar would have had
to spell “uinae, uaedae, uaessae.” Poor man,
how was lie to know that in English some
day the single letter i. when long, could be
used for his old diphthong? Kizar, beware
the aeds of the nineteenth century!
In teaching any foreign language, then, it
is important to assert the probability of its
being unlike our own. If Latin is pro-
nounced with English sounds, it seems little
more than an ingenious trick. You use your
own easy language, and build out of it some-
thing different, difficult and mechanical! If.
on the other hand, Latin is admitted to have
its own pronunciation, it. at once loses its
mechanical quality and stands forth as some-
thing natural, like a tree. For many stu-
dents Latin is fated to be the only foreign
language of which even a glimpse is obtained.
How important, then, that the language
should be revealed as something . with an
independent and deep-rooted life of its own!
LALAGE.
A Clean Breast
It was surely in reference to the personality
of liis friend Frank Harris that Oscar Wilde,
at one of those celebrated luncheons at the
Cafe Royal, declared that indiscretion was
the better part of valor. For Frank Harris
is a man of many parts : he is famous as an
editor and a critic; he has written admirable
short stories; he is generous to a fault, lavish
in praise, vociferous in damnation —domineer-
ing, sympathetic, bellicose and versatile; but
reticence was never among liis virtues. He
has the grand manner; an air of abandoned
elegance is about him. His eyes flash ; his
hair bristles. Max Beerbohm has called him
the best talker in London; and Bernard
Shaw has paid homage to the stentorian
quality of his voice. He cannot help talk-
ing ; and being an artist he is at his best
when talking about himself. In fact, ego-
tism is the beginning of art, and, according
to Harris, “modesty is the fig-leaf of medi-
ocrity.’’ He began his literary life with
“The Bomb,” and has ended it with an ex-
plosion.
An old man now, Frank Harris finds his
chief pleasure in reminiscence. The first
instalment of My Life and Loves comes
to us, privately printed, from Germany. It
is a book of outspoken autobiography. It is
naked—and unashamed. Critics may rage
and professors pullulate; the police may
issue a warrant, and the guardian of public
virtue cast up his gorge—Harris doesn't
care a damn. No such book lias hitherto
appeared in English. It is a history of
sexual development.
Here Nature is, alive and untamed,
Unafraid and unashamed;
Here man knows woman with the greed
Of Adam’s wonder, the primal need.
A more accurate title for it would have been
“The Art of Love, with Illustrations and
Examples from the Life of Frank Harris ;
for the detailed thoroughness of his exposi-
tion makes Ovid’s masterpiece pale to a fairy-
tale for growing girls.
Following an historic precept, Harris has
left no sensation untried. Solomon with his
700 wives could hardly have had a more
delectable series of amatory adventures than
Harris with his pretty girls. Solomon wrote
the Proverbs; Harris has written Revela-
tions, exposing the mysteries of Eros. Quite
early in life, when he had run away to
America, he borrowed the quiver of Cupid,
and maid and meretrix became easy prey
to his archery. He has post-mortemed his
passions, exalting to the sublimity of a
sacred rite all the practices of the Cytherean
cult. Candor has outweighed compunction;
and where others have been content with a
row of discreet dots, Harris fills in the de-
tails. He remembers the girls in the time of
his youth, when the days were full of pro-
mise and the nights were bright with possi-
bilities. Memory is full of savor to him
still. He analyses and reveals; he sketches
the awakening of first-love, the flower-like
opening of guilty knowledge, the thwarted
cravings, the transcendent bliss of desire
gratified. He paints the seductiveness of
limb, and shows the witchery of womanly
curve and contour. All the ardent strivings
for fulfilment, the awkward first attempts,
the failures and the sharp rapture of attain-
ment are crowded on his canvas. He lias
studied the perversities of temperament,
ruminated in erotic fancies, diagnosed the
maladies of the feminine mind ; and now with
Gallic frankness he makes his oblations at
the altar of Aphrodite.
William Blake, with rare penetration,
wrote —
What is it men in women most require?
The lineaments of gratified desire.
And authors, the world over, have amplified
in plays, poems and stories this bald 'state
ment. ' All but a few have failed to giy-
reality to their discourse, or to tell the plai
truth regarding the intimacies of intercom’s
between men and women. Rudyard Kipling
confesses that
I was a young Tm at ’Oogli,
Shy as a girl to begin;
But Aggie de Castrer she made me,
An’ Aggie was clever as sin.
This is the merest flirtation with fact: yet
few writers in the Christian era have dared
to go further. The entertainments of Boccac-
cio are phases of sensual frivolity; the
naughty novels of Margaret of Navarre are
only commonplace incidents spiced with sen
sation; the Restoration comedies are exer
cises of cynical wit; the Abbe Bran tome’s
“Lives of Gallant Ladies” reads like a cata-
logue of quaint sins; Rousseau is like a neu-
rasthenic newsboy seeking scandal in the
suburbs; and Marie Bashkirtseff hides her
desires under a blush, while even the im-
mortal Pepys pulls down the blind on the
most interesting parts of liis adventures.
It is only Casanova, Prince Regent at the
Court of Venus, who, with his subtler art and
suggestive wit, outshines the urbane Harris.
And Casanova laid a scalpel to his soul. To
indulge his senses was his declared intention
in life. A self-anointed scoundrel who
essayed seduction in every capital in Europe.
Casanova was always attracted by “the
rigor of the game.” It is his mantle which has
fallen on Frank Harris, whose book is a pro-
test against the sniggering, suggestive, key-
hole methods of the majority of writers who
are afraid to deal truthfully with sex rela-
tionships. It will be anathema to Mrs.
Grundy, because it unveils her most sacred
taboo. But when all the rhetoric and labored
counterblast has echoed away, it will find a
place beside the Memoirs of the Chevalier de
Seingalt.
REG S. ELLERY.
Books and Broadcasting
With something like a tremor I read sen-
tences like this: “As the effects of extensive
reading, though undoubtedly important, are
difficult to assess, so the effects of regular
listening, though obviously considerable, are
impossible to compute. The mental influences
of wireless broadcasting are sufficient proof
that it will have a permanent effect upon
those who have come into contact with it,
just as the mental influences of a noble writer,
such as Ituskin or Arnold, may be realised
without any concrete instances being given.’’
Allowing for the fact that these lines were
written by a man whose views are naturally
colored by his circumstances —they are from
the pen of J. C. W. Keith, managing director
of the British Broadcasting Co. —it has to be
granted that they carry more than a sugges-
tion of truth. The spoken word, in many
avenues of life, has displaced the written
one; the telephone, for instance, has done
much to kill the art of letter-writing. Yet,
contrary to the expectations of many, wire-
less broadcasting has not taken the place of
newspaper, platform or stage; in many in-
stances it has definitely assisted these points
of contact with the people. Broadcasting has
found a niche of its own. But will it always
be so? Those lines of Mr. Keith’s seem to
hold a challenge.
Man lias fought upward, from the time
when he first began to exchange his thoughts
by means of sound to the point when he
learned to preserve them with written sym-
bols ; and now we find men claiming, in all
soberness, that those first sounds will be of
greater importance, and Will affect his life
more, than his priceless collections of sym-
bols, books —the books which Bacon called
“shrines.” It is the terrific handicap that
written language has alongside the spoken
which makes me wonder —the thousand differ-
ent inflections, the delicately-shaded nuances :
written, it would take hundreds of unwieldy
words clumsily to convey the same meaning.
The cinema, the gramophone or any medium
other than books by which thoughts and
world-pictures are carried seems to form no
parallel. Even the cinema, complete as its
presentations can be made, needs words,
written or spoken, to support it. And the
gramophone is an inanimate thing, bound by
mechanical limitations which do not affect
the broadcasters. Any means of thought-
expression we have by sound is theirs to use.
They can take the books themselves (books
of Kuskin and Arnold, if they wish), and
give them life and verve, losing none of the
authors’ genius, but adding many graces
which in print would be impossible. Tolstoy
has advised us to read and think aloud, the
voice, presumably, helping the art of read-
ing ; but now even the reading is not neces-
sary. We can get the same results by
merely listening.
Still, broadcasting may be simply a rever-
sion to the primitive, for speech was in
existence long before any means were found
of perpetuating it. And man has shown his
approval of the discovery of books as a means
of preserving his thoughts, and has set bis
imprimatur upon it, through the years; it is
hard to believe that a custom so firmly founded
can be seriously shaken. But will not the
written thoughts be handed over to this new
art, and in their diffusion be mightily im-
proved with the aid of sound and expression?
The drama, too, is sometimes held out as
proof of the security of books; the advan-
tages of the stage are obvious, yet books re-
main. But, then, the stage lias never pen-
etrated into men’s lives as this new factor
has, or soon will, nor has it been possible to
reach the stage with the same small effort
that it needs to take a book down from a
shelf: No; a new dimension has been given
to mankind, infinitely wider and deeper than
that ever offered by “dead words,” and just
as accessible.
Then there is another aspect. I would set
np my aerial to-morrow,” said \\ ilfred
Whitten, “if, in the heart of London, I could
hear the cattle lowing on the hills, or the
barking of a fox in Essex, or the scream of
an eagle over a Scottish glen. I would gladly
summon the roar of Niagara to redress the
roar of the Strand ; but such tilings are not
yet.” Since those words were written these
things have been done, or something very
closely resembling them. And which is the
better —to read of the cattle lowing on the
hills, or to hear them? To he told of the
scream of an eagle over a glen, or to hear
the scream? Reading is but means to an
end. and if the picture may be gained with
greater vividness and truthfulness, which
method of presenting it is going to survive.
Many will recoil from this prospect m
something very near to horror. That the
dusty, precious books, those collections of
symbols, should lose their worth in the eyes
of the world, their place to be taken by bla-
tant, desecrating sound, is a fearful thought
to the booklover. ITasditt, who was never
happier than when in the midst of quiet,
would have regarded this science of noise as
a black art indeed. And I wonder what
Thoreau, hater of bustle and worldliness,
would have had to say of the incursions of
sound and voices into men’s lives. Yet the
time when mankind will listen rather than
read seems not so very far off. Instead of
reading of the rushing of rivers, we will hear
them, and through a loud-speaker the wind
in the fir-trees will tell us of the weakness
of descriptive words.

Cricket and flow to Play It, by Gilbert Jessop
(Geo. G. Ha nap and Co.). A short treatise, with
very little anecdote or reminiscence to enliven it:
dull stuff for the most exhilarating batsman who ever
took guard.

One of the publishers’ “Beautiful” series, the enter-
taining text to which is admirably illustrated bv
Ernest Haselhurst, the water-colorist. Old London
is rapidly disappearing, but this author and his
artist ale doing fine work in preserving it at
least on paper.
Gum-tree Brownie , by Tarella Quin (Robertson
and Mullens). Children will revel in this collection
of charming fantasies written by an authoress who
has the rare art of interesting the child mind. The
illustrations, by Ida Rentoul (Mrs. Outlnvaite), range
from dainty little creations as delicate as gossamer to
piquant studies of mischievous imps.
The Slave. Ship, by Mary Johnston (Thornton
Butterworth). The author is a Virginian, whose pen
carries her into the romantic “colonial’ days made
familiar to English readers by Thackeray. This, hei
latest novel, is a story of the slave trade to the
southern plantations in the eighteenth century, the
hero, transported after the battle of Culloden, suffers
in his own person all the pains and indignities ot
slavery. Subsequently he escapes and himself becomes
accessory to slave trading, eventually finding his
redemption in a full conception of all that abominable
traffic meant. The book has many dramatic passages,
in the lady’s characteristic style.

Who shall remember that I strove, and
sinned,
Or keep the memory of a pale young face,
Or hear my voiceless song, faint iike a wind
That blows from nowhere in some lonely

Yet these, the things I loved, shall not forget l
The birds and bees, the path along the

The Remembered Valley.
I have thrilled to its beauty, soul and sense,
By shadow and sun and star;
And wherever the cares of the city fret.
I vision my valley at morning set
In the sweep of the hills afar.
On the gracious green of the dewy slopes
The shadows are cool and long,
And the proud pines dream by the wakening
rills;
And a stream in the heart of the higher hills
Is a trickle of silver song.
Down in the dip where the wet moss
gleams—
For the wild things passing through—-
A thin brown pathway winds and turns
Through a shimmering tangle of grass and
ferns,
Where the sunlight strikes the dew.
And ever the cares of the long years fall
From the worshipping spirit there,
As the drifts of the grey mists slowly rise
To the hills, massed purple on rose-hued
skies,
When the morn is serenely fair.

In This Hour.
Cheek to cheek ami arms enfolded
And the warm sweet darkness over all,
Life for this hour our lives has moulded
Since heart first answered its heart-mate's
call.
Ghosts of gardens are all about us,
Wonderful rivers where lilies gleam ,
Time forgets us or seems to flout us
To leave us linked in a timeless dream.
Your breath on my face and your soft, dark
lashes
A butterfly touch on my mouth ! And then
A flame flicks up in poor Wisdom's ashes
And thought returns to the ways of men.
Though we be as gods in the shadow's cover.
We are mortal things with a mortal span;
And Winter comes for the warmest lover
And the cleaving shears to the days of
Man.
And I ask —with a dull acceptance, knowing
The day will come of the graven stone —•
I pon what hillside of bracken glowing
Or wind-swept plain shall I sleep alone.
Will you be the first to find the clover
And the long, long rest where we dream no
more V
Or shall I go out —to the last your lover —
Where a blue wave leaps to a waiting
shore?
Will some haunting horror of mausoleum
In the city purlieus lock you in?
Could your winging soul chant its high Te
Deum
From a mound of earth and a wreath of
tin ?
God grant you bees and the breath of clover
And the loom of hills where you lie. asleep,
And my soul, as a wild bird, hovering over
The grass, grown green from the tears I
weep!
If the gods were kind they would make this
darkness
A little blacker, our pulse more slow,
Till love’s aftermath was a gradual stark-
ness
And we went out, as the flowers go,
Loving utterly, fearing never,
Arms enfolding and heart on heart.
Not even death could our glad dust sever
Whom to-morrow’s light on the hills shall
part!

WHITE AUSTRALIA AND THE REVO-
LUTION MAKERS.
The refusal of British crews to take their
ships out of Australian waters has had the
first effect of giving an advantage to vessels
manned by black and tans. The fact has dire
significance; for if the white seaman insists
on driving himself from the sea to make room
for the alien, it is difficult to see how the
purity of the race in Australia can be main-
tained. The thronging of our coastal towns
by the colored crews of the ships in port must
in time not only familiarise those crews with
our conditions, but constantly weaken the
arguments of those who maintain that indus-
try can be carried on by white labor. Every
employer forced to accept cheap brown labor
at sea becomes the more disposed to admit
colored labor on land. Once the sea has
been given to the brown man, every indus-
trial upheaval ashore will increase the cry
for similar substitutes for the white worker
who will not go on with his job. The hold-
up caused by the British seamen has been
engineered by those who are considered the
leaders of the Australian seamen, and the
movement has the support of some Austra-
lian unions. It is therefore clear that a
dangerous national crisis has been reached;
for, on present showing, the mind of the
Australian workers in the great sea-carrying
trade so confuses primary things with those
of secondary importance that they are will-
ing to play ducks and drakes with our whole
future in order to throw a badly-aimed stone
at the British shipping companies. Even a
British seaman might have been expected to
regard the chief item of the Australian
national faith as worth more than ninepence
a day; and in all probability he would have
done so if the matter had been so put to him.
Unfortunately the men who are outwardly
responsible for the hold-up have shown no
trace of any real regard for our nationality,
and have presented the matter to the seamen
in a way which is utterly false.
* * * #
The spectacle of the alien-manned ships
putting out to sea while the companies which
have white crews have their business sus-
pended and a knife held at their throats
teaches a lesson too simple to be misread.
If the present attitude is maintained the
directors of those companies which have been
loyal to their race will be forced to move
into line with those whose standards were
lower. The directors have a duty to their
shareholders, a duty to the public and an
obligation to carry out contracts. However
unwilling they may be to make a change
these considerations must in the end force their
hands; and the fight over ninepence a day
will dwindle into a mere nothing when the
battleground is changed and the white sea-
man finds himself compelled to put up a far
harder struggle for the right to go to sea
at all. Nor is it in any way reasonable to
suppose that the white seaman will then be
able tp look for support to the white public
to which he has given no consideration. The
arguments against the colored seaman are
many; the risk run by making the lives of
passengers depend in times of danger on such
crews is serious; the advantage in point of
cost is probably small. Yet all these things
put together cannot outweigh the far greater
danger of breaking all sea connections and
leaving a land like Australia isolated. Those
connections must be maintained in some way,
and the strikers are practically showing that
the way is by the use of alien crews. Over
a question of ninepence a day they are will-
ing to isolate Australia and other lands,
starve Britain and throw all other industries
into confusion on both sides of the world;
and they attempt this knowing that all mari-
time Asia is anxious to do the work they
refuse!
* * # #
It is not reasonable to suppose that the
men on strike have considered these matters
or that such an attitude is intentional. It
is not even certain that their advisers and
leaders have thought of anything beyond a
continuous policy of irritation and injury,
with some idea, of having the tawdry glory
of an alleged win over the employers; but it
is certain that behind those advisers and
leaders there are men who see such a strike
in all its possible bearings. It is possible
enough that in pursuing their aims they
claim to be well-intentioned. There was
never yet a tyrant who failed to make the
same claim nor a revolutionary of the reddest
type who failed to assert that the worst
cruelties were meant in kindness. These
would-be destroyers have all found that the
chief obstacle to their revolutionary progress
is nationalism. Love of country is deeply
rooted among ordinary citizens, and it has,
therefore, become the new custom of the so-
called internationalists to denounce patriot-
ism. In the seamen they imagine that they
have one of their strongest weapons, because
the connections between land and land are
made by the labors of these men. The pre-
sent strike is an illustration of the way in
which they hope to carry on their campaign.
By encouraging British seamen in Austra-
lian waters to directly act against the in-
terests of their unions in Britain they
imagine they see the way to sow discord be-
tween the two countries. Whether the sailor
starves or not is of no consequence to them ;
he would probably be killed in the desired
revolution anyhow. Their main purpose is
to create a difficulty between Britain and
Australia on the point about which a mis-
understanding is most likely to arise. They
know that the manning of ships by Asiatic
aliens for the Australian trade is the easiest
defence the British shipping companies can
put up against white seamen who refuse
to do their work; and they know that such
a course would be more repugnant than any
other to the. great majority of Australian
citizens. Vain men who hope to gain power
with the British seamen in the larger ship-
ping centres are easily made the agents of
such a scheme; and these in turn make use
of the seamen for what they deem their own
purposes. The strike did not take place be-
cause the seamen are furious about losing
ninepence a day, though the seamen honestly
believe that is the cause. It did not happen
because Walsh would like to hold the posi-
tion of power now held by Havelock: Wilson,
though he may be vain enough to think that
sufficient noise on his part will put him there.
The real cause of the strike was the pulling
of strings by men who desire revolution, and
who regard the deepest possibly injury to
Australia as a step towards their objective.
THE GENTLE ART OF CADGING.
“Liverpool shipping circles criticise the reported
decision of the Trades Facilities Committee to make
a grant to the Government of AVestern Australia for
replacement of the steamship Bambra. It is pointed
out that two British companies trading on the coast
had replaced two out of four of their steamers at
a cost of £lOO,OOO each without help from the
British taxpayer.”— Cablegram.
“The cadger’s battle once begun,
Bequeathed from begging sire to son,
May not be dignified, but pays in the long run.”
—From an unpublished classic.
It is time the great, rich State in the A Vest
heard some plain speaking, for Australia’s
sake and its own. In days of yore, if 25
years is far enough back to be yore, it was
a distinctly Protectionist State. There was
no Commonwealth then to blame when things
went wrong, or to blame when things were
said to go wrong but didn’t, or to beg sub-
sidies and railways from, or to threaten with
secession and abandonment of the common
debt. When the big State enjoyed freedom
of action it protected (and when local sup-
plies were insufficient, paid duties on) its
bacon, barley (plain, pearl and malting),
biscuits, butter, cheese, currants, eggs, fish,
flour, fruit, its hams, tongues, honey, hops,
jams, jellies, maize, preserved milk, oats,
onions, olives, potatoes, vinegar, vegetables,
rum, beer, brandy, whisky and wine and its
loose drinks. It taxed imported bricks,
towels, machinery, horse-blinkers, spruce beer
and tombstones, and it taxed salt like the
very deuce and palings like perdition. But
though the taxation was heavy it was
clumsily arranged, and the improvement in
local industry was less than it might have
been. The imports per head at the end of
the century were an Australian record, and
the exactions were heavy. Under Federation
the situation improved :
Customs Excise Total
June, 1899. per Head, per Head. per Head.
Westralia .. £5 5 9 £0 3 5 £5 9 2
June, 1924.
Westralia .. 361 113 1 4 19 2
Australian average 468 1 16 5 631
The net result is that Westralians, whose Fed-
eral politicians have gone suddenly mad in
their demands for what they call “Free-
trade,” professing their State to be ruined
through the taxes voted by eastern Protec-
tionists, pay nothing like their share to the
common fund, and are much less tariff-taxed
than when they taxed themselves.
* * * *
The big State has gone through three
phases. At the beginning of Federation its
politicians demanded and obtained the right
to levy, for a term of years, a separate tariff
of their own because the Federal one would
certainly be insufficient. Next they secured
a subsidy, for a term of years, at the expense
of Westralia’s neighbors, on the grounds that
the financial situation -was insufficient. The
present situation is that Westralian politi-
•cians complain bitterly of being “flooded”
with goods which come in free from the east-
ern States, and want compensation for that.
At the same time they clamor that Protec-
tionist duties should be abolished so that
they may be “flooded” with the products of
cheap-labor countries with which Westralia
is much less able to compete than with its
white neighbors, and failing that they want
more compensation in some shape or form.
It is a frequent grievance that Westralia
suffered from the first day of union by com-
petition with the more advanced manufac-
tures of the East. But the largest single
item of a year’s import from the eastern
States which it is possible to trace in West-
ralia’s own recent statistics is butter, and
a great agricultural country which fails to
supply itself with sufficient butter, also with
cheese, eggs, honey, bacon, hams, milk,
cream, onions, etc., in competition with
rather distant competitors who are white
and pay Australian wages, really seems more
like a loafer than a sufferer.
* * * *
Westralia is the State with the highest
factory wages and the shortest hours, and
its local taxation has been consistently, for a
dozen years, below the Australian average.
Its railways, in the last year for which full
statistics are complete (June, 1924), ranked
second best for profit in a series where pro-
fits were few. It has a bigger sinking fund
than all the other States combined, and the
fund constantly grows. The gift of the East-
to-West railway was a streak of luck which
might have inspired in it a certain amount
of gratitude; wliat it chiefly did inspire was
the demand for a Federal line from Port
Augusta to Hay by way of rounding off the
benefaction, and for another across the
northern part of the continent to divert the
trade of the Northern Territory. Now there
is a demand that the State be compensated
for the alleged losses suffered by its mostly
outside shareholders, in common with others,
through the official fixing of gold prices dur-
ing the war. There is also a proposition
from Westralia for a bonus, to last for “a
period of years,” on gold produced. It is
apparently assumed in local political circles
that the report of the Commission on this
subject and on Westralian claims generally
is a foregone conclusion, like that of the
N. S. Wales body which was appointed to
release certain I.W.W. convicts. At any
rate, a Freetrade member from the West
asked the Prime Minister the other day to
hurry up the report and get busy with pay-
ing the subsidy; and he received the soft
answer which turns away bile, for the time
at all events.
* * * *
There was a tendency among pacific folk
to think that there must be some reason be-
hind these incessant demands from the
Golden State; but the latest report that it
has struck, or attempted to strike, J. Bull
for the present of a ship, or a contribution
towards one, suggests that it has simply got
the begging habit to the limit. A positive
squeal of anguish was raised the other day
when it was reported that some hustling
“organiser” had pushed a subscription-list
for a well-known charity into the hands of
our recent visitors of the American Fleet.
Yet, putting the question of taste aside, those
young warriors, with few of the marks of battle
upon them, could a thousand times better
afford to be tapped by their friends than our
battered and impoverished parent. It is
really time we did a little more than present
him with lip sympathy in his days of great
stress. We might at least keep our hands
out of his pockets.
THE SOLDIERS’ LONDON.
I have lately suffered a pang of nostalgia
for London. I was born in Queensland, and
never saw London before the war. But my
wartime memories of it have never failed to
exhilarate; and now they are tugging at me
hard.
To me it does not matter that Englishmen
during the war always said that wasn’t the
real London—the pre-war London —but a
feverish wartime city alternating between
the gloom of the war-incubus and flashes of
forced gaiety. They declared that nobody
and nothing were normal. Beginning with
politics, they showed how the great party
traditions had been brushed aside by a coali-
tion of expediency. The House of Commons
itself had lost its decorous note. The leisured
consideration of business, the old suavity, the
delicate raillery, tlie demonstrations of cul-
ture and learning and of sheer oratory—
in brief, all the amenities—had gone. The
place was too downright for words. It was
now an arena of restless men—jumpy, their
nerves frayed, snapping at each other, in-
capable of sustained attention, anxious only
to get business through. A ghastly note of
utility and opportunism—even of practicality
and materialism—had crept in, that ran
counter to all the English political traditions
and was spoiling the game of politics, as this
hideous European conflagration was spoiling
the game of war. The old delectable view
of war as a graceful sporting incident in
Imperial expansion—the view nourished by
Kipling and his kind —was supplanted by
a view of war as a filthy necessity of the
most revolting seriousness. English sport
was inhibited. Riding to hounds was a thing
of gay memories. Polo, the steeplechase—
even golf and tennis—had been sadly hit.
The playing-fields of England were deserted
for the trenches. Only symbolically were
they still peopled—by the men who were
winning the war. Academic life had shrunk
and sagged. The universities were denuded
of all except women and the unfit and a
handful of medical students finishing off.
And half the women had flung aside their
studies for war-work. The theatres had gone
to the dogs. Nothing but music-halls, revue
and musical comedy would now draw a house.
The theatres catered for the men on leave.
These must be diverted at all costs; nothing
must be served up to them that would make
them think—they must be made to forget.
And the way to make them forget was to
give them kaleidoscopic shows where the in-
cident was so swift, fragmentary and discur-
sive that there was nothing to fix the atten-
tion on. So the revue came into its own
with a rush. The time was past when, any
night in London, you could have your choice
of three or four Shakspearean plays. If you
wanted Shakspeare now, you need not
seek it in the theatres of the West End:
you must cross the river to that barn of a
place in the Waterloo-road —-the Old Vic. —
and sit in discomfort for three hours, and—
what is worse —bend your brain to grapple
with Elizabethan subtleties. No! The West
End theatre was the place where you could
lie back on plush, and need bend your brain
to cope with nothing: it was bent for you.
Even eating and drinking, time-honored
English rites, were now desecrated. People
ate for utility—to sustain mere brute
strength. Eating was no longer an end in
itself, a ritual to be savored by its devotees.
They were concerned not with the old atmo-
sphere and appurtenances of dining, but with
the distressing urgency of the question: Will
there be enough ? They no longer even dressed
fittingly for the rite: they ate in lounge suits
and morning dresses. Many a retired colonel,
accustomed to be sustained on grills and
sherry, with perhaps a half-bottle of cham-
pagne, a chosen sweet and a delicate savory,
actually wilted under the artisan fare of
filthy frozen beef, potatoes, stodgy puddings
and discolored bread. Some of them genu-
inely declined in vigor and never regained
their ground. Some of them even died under
it. And to get this plebeian beef their
housekeepers had often to stand in queues
of incredible length and rapacity. And
then, when their turn did come, they might
be cheated even of chilled beef and be re-
duced to “offal,” as it was called. As for
the gourmands of the middle class —the solid
consumers of good mutton, thorough-going
sweets, cheeses, pastry and good whisky—
they were roughly handled indeed. They
pooled most of their meat tickets in exchange
for one lean week-end joint, which they had
*hot on Sunday in severely appraised helpings,
cold on Tuesday, hashed on Thursday. And
in the intervals they got fish, or bully-beef,
less strictly rationed, but for which none
the less precious meat tickets had to be dis-
gorged. They would have spurned it before
the war; now they consumed it with grati-
tude while the men in Prance were hurling
it contemptuously into No Man’s Land or
building dug-outs of it, as with bricks. The
glorious butter of the pre-war era was now
meticulously apportioned at the beginning of
the week, each cube sacred to its proprietor
until the next ration was drawn. And before
that arrived they were choking down the
well-cursed margarine. Sugar—well, there
was so much sugar, and no more; and not
the richest Londoner could get more than his
sugar ration by any bribe. The cheese that
he would have given the eyes out of his head
for the soldiers were chucking away in
France. To Prance the good whisky went,
to maintain efficiency in the officers’ messes.
What they got on the Home Front was often
green and cost a pound a bottle; and fre-
quently it could not be got in London for
any money. In Prance, bought by the case
in the E.P.C., it cost about four shillings a
bottle: good stuff! The chocolate-eating
flappers But no: their case is too pain-
ful even for analysis in retrospect. In a
word, England at the height of the sub-
marine campaign came close to stark hunger.
Many strata of “the lower classes” actually
achieved it. The rich in London, and even
the less-rich in the remoter provinces, fared
better. But on the whole it is just as well
the Germans were not aware how nearly the
U-boats’ onslaught came to succeeding. (Like
Galsworthy, I seem to have been writing
a lot about food.)
Domestic life was all inverted, food apart.
The sons were “across,” and often the daugh-
ters. The head of the house (I think Eng-
lish fathers like to be styled so) was half
his nights sitting on war-time local commit-
tees or pacing bis beat as a special con-
stable. The mothers were distrait. For all
there was, beside the fear for fighting rela-
tives, the suspense of the actual or impend-
ing air raid. The family symposia lacked
their contributors. The domestic leisure —
so dear an institution in England—had been
filched away. The nocturnal _ bridge-party
was almost 'squeezed out of existence. The
only bridge, apart from that of men’s clubs,
was played by sybaritic women, chiefly by
daylight—women who dodged war-work and
met in each other’s houses or in the club-
house on the golf-course. Home-music, home-
talk, home-parties, home-dances —all were
curtailed.
In short, there was no dearest English
Institution, no aspect of private or public
life, no form of work or play that the war did
not blight and transmute. No soldier from
the Antipodes visiting England on leave


knew anything of the real and normal Lon-
don : so Londoners said. If that is true, I
shall never fail to regret that I did not see
London-as-it-was-before-the-war. For there
is reason to doubt if the phenomenon will
ever re-appear.

Australia’s Advertisement.
It lias been a subject of complaint by globe-
trotters and others that Australia is little
known and little considered abroad. That
is fast being remedied. By reason of too
much patient subservience to imported men,
including an abusive Dutchman, an irish-
man formerly in the ship’s fireman line of
business and a Scotch ex-parson who com-
municates with Moscow, advertisement is
pouring in. This country’s borrowings, Bol-
shevism and strikes (the Queensland railway
stoppage being the latest and most glaring
example) had attracted a certain amount of
attention, but at the worst they were local
matters and not international. The strike of
British seamen in Australian ports is in a
category by itself. It is a mutiny of British
unionists against British unionism. It was
organised by rowdy persons high in trades-
union circles, and adopted, not only by union-
ism, but by the State Government of the
most populous and most indebted section of
the Commonwealth. The Lang Ministry went
out of its way to take the strike to its bosom,
and the Premier assured the world at large
that Prime Minister Bruce, who didn’t take
it to his bosom, evidently “knew nothing
about the psychology of the Australian work-
man or the British seaman.” The speaker,
to whom N.S.W. has unluckily committed
charge of its affairs, is himself a child of the
suburbs and the office stool, a person of little
travel, and a pursuer of the unadventurous
and unlearned profession of estate-agency. In
committing _ N.S.W. to a line of action by
reason of his acquaintance with the psycho-
logy of the Australian toiler and the British
seaman, he has made history of a very dan-
gerous description. He lias laid down
the proposition that a State has the
right to refuse the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment the use of State Judges, police
and prisons for the carrying-out of
Commonwealth laws to which the crowd in
office in the said State objects. Some results
so far are the passage of a bill authorising
the Commonwealth Government to appoint
its own police to do what Lang has for-
bidden the N. S. Wales police to do, the
nomination of a Board to deal with the cases
ol candidates for deportation, the repudia-
uon of Lang and his disreputable Commu-
nist associates by British trades-unionism,
and the recognition of Australia and parti-
cularly of the Ma State by the British press
as the Bolshevik centre of the Empire, and a
meddlesome and aggressive one at that. Bol-
shevism being a concern which doesn’t pay
its debts or even its rent, and doesn’t get
credit, the advertisement is even worse than
ihe one which Storey, Dooley and Lang
opened with when they asked for power,
under their Profiteering Bill (in its original
shape) and their (promptly abandoned) Land
l all to confiscate property wholesale,
whether owned by local people or out-
siders. And Lang’s public works policy, his
44-hour week, pensions for widows and sirni-
ar schemes are almost wholly dependent on
goodwill 0 f the British moneylender.
It the Commonwealth Government scores a
decisive and spectacular victory by the de-
portation of the imported revolutionary
hoodlums who run the riot, and thereby
gives, a guarantee of saner times to come, the
had impression may be dissipated. It: will
he a sort of proof, despite the X. <4. Wales
Labor revolt against Commonwealth law and
the insurrectionary doings in Queensland
that there ns a power in Australia which can
deal with Bolshevism. If the Commonwealth
authority fails to do anything decisive the
country is likely to go from bad advertise-
ment to worse, until estate-agents, lawyers
and other “bourgeoisie” fall by the wayside,
and possibly lack any pomp of burial

“For the Sake of a Few Match-makers.”
ifiE foreign-trader is a monotonous person.
nee more, for the millionth time or there-
abouts, he has asked how we can possibly
justify a stiff duty on matches “for the
benefit of one small factory which supplies
only a fraction 0 f our requirements.” The
foolish person is probably a descendant of
the Dutch mother who smacked her child for
dirtying his clothes while he stopped the
b'jk in the historic dyke and, incidentally,
saved liis country. A dozen years ago. and
tor many years before that, there was an
enterprising saddler in Adelaide named
Holden —H. J. Holden. He had faith in
himself and in his own organising abilities:
but all the faith in the world, though it
might move mountains, would not put the
horse-drawn vehicle that calls for much
saddlery back on the roads. So he turned
his mind to the making of bodies for the
motor trade and for a start bought his
friend Hack’s old coach-building business.
It was doing pretty well, too—turning out
no less than six motor bodies a month!
But, of course, Holden knew that wouldn’t
do—he would have, to put up works and
instal plant to turn out probably 40 or 50
a month. That meant more capital than
lie had, and he went round to the Bank of
Adelaide to see what could be got. Screw-
ing up his courage, he said he might want
180,000. Fortunately the Bank of Adelaide,
like most other Australian banks, wants to
see industries flourishing in our own country,
and, though the amount did seem large, the
directors dug into the matter. The question
of Protection at once arose. Suppose Mr.
Holden got his works going, how could
he hope to capture a trade and keep it
against well-organised foreign competition ?
The Customs Department was sympathetic:
luckily neither its political nor its permanent
heads were foolish enough to ask whether
they had the right to put a duty on motor
bodies for the benefit of a little coach-build-
ing works turning out half a dozen vehicles
a month. Holden persuaded the Department
that the industry could, and should, be
established, just as he had persuaded the
bank; the duty was imposed—something iu
the neighborhood of 50 p.c. —and the works
started. That is less than 10 years ago.
For the month of August the output of
the two factories —one in Adelaide and one
at Woodville, near Port Adelaide —was 3640
bodies. The man who was bold enough to
ask the bank for £30,000 is the head of a
co. which has a turnover of two millions
a year and the other day put up its own
nominal capital to a million with a view
to further large increases upon the present
paid capital of about quarter of a million.
When he first talked over his project with
the Coachbuilders’ Union lie said he would
want 40 men almost at once. The union
said it was afraid he would have to want—
there weren’t that many in the trade in
the whole State. To-day out of Hack’s
little shop with its half-dozen bodies a month
have grown two Holden shops that employ
nearly 3000 hands; last year (and there has
been great progress since then) £680,000
was distributed in wages. And how many
the works employ indirectly no man can tell.
The machine is everywhere; man and
machine multiply by as much as 180 the
work of the man and his old hand-tools.
(In one operation two men with hand-tools
did eight in a day; two men and the machine
now do 180 in an hour.) So the machinery-
maker has had and still has a job, too;
and the builder, to cover 15 acres of floor-
space ; and the multitude of small tradesmen
who supply the needs of the nearly 3000* on
the pay-sheet. Even the educationist has
had his little bit of benefit out of it; for that
younger Holden who is the general manager
of the works is a product of the Science
school of the Adelaide University. Much
farther even than that has the country
gained ; for, as nearly always happens, along-
side Holden’s a number of smaller works
have sprung up to do the same class of busi-
ness ; and as time goes on these open up
other avenues and in some instances have
themselves already become specialists. And
away at the back of it all is Hack’s little
coachbuilding shop, turning out. its. half-
dozen bodies a month; and beside it the
man of vision who, protected by the duty he
was not afraid to ask for, laid the founda-
tions of an industry great in . itself and
infinitely greater in its possibilities of mul-
tiplication and expansion.

How Shall We Man a Navy?
“Caractacus” : Men such as “Forebridge”
(B. 20/8/’25), who have weathered the first-
few disillusioning years of a naval life, and,
salted, have been won to the naval tradition,
naturally stigmatise as a “quaint creed” any
tendency to regard the Navy as a part-time
job. They will no more see good in the
United States four years’ service than they
will subscribe to the U.S. allegiance to elec-
tricity in opposition to steam. Their loyalty
is all to their credit. Nevertheless, the Navy,
as far as Australia is concerned, is a part-
time job, despite the loyalty aud enthusiasm
of its (mostly English) officers. The Aus-
tralian is not taking to naval life as he
should if the land is to be defended by its
own sons. In course of time, perhaps, the
R.A.N. as a whole-time job may become more
popular. In the meantime' there are ways
and means of making that part-time job as
free from economic and human waste as can
be contrived. Agreed that the youth turned
out of the U.S. Navy at 22 years of age will
not he “much of a sailor” —marine, engineer,
artificer, as the case may be. In four years,
however, lie will have learned enough of
naval life to decide whether he will continue
in it and make it his career. If his verdict
is 'for a land vocation he will enter that voca-
tion better equipped for it than if he had
never tried the sea, and with hotter oppor-
tunities of fitting hack into it than the long-
service man would have. Under the R.N.
and R.A.N. system the sailor who relin-
quishes the sea after 7, 12 or 15 years re-
sumes civilian life actually handicapped—
and the Navy has wasted seven or more years
of its time and money upon him. On the
other hand, the youth who at the end of four
years finds the sea to his taste is as likely
to adopt it as a career as if he had been
bound to 7or 12 years’ service. The R.A.N.
will not be any worse off through being well
stocked with short-term men—short-term
men are at least as good as borrowed men
or no men at all —and Australia will ho
better off to the extent of having trained
several hundred Al-quality youths a little
in both trade-craft and sea-craft. It is idle
to pretend that the bluejacket of to-day
spends all his time in intensive study of sea
warfare methods. Officers may; so may
specialist ratings. But the amount of brass-
polishing, deck-scrubbing, disciplinary ritual
and parading allotted the rank and file shows
that it is quite different with them. Lower
ratings are, in effect, laborers on board, and
will he laborers when they get their dis-
charge. We cannot afford to maintain a
navy as an incubator for civilian laborers.
The American method of “catching ’em
young” and training them in handicrafts
when caught does not render any less useful
as sailors those recruits who, after four
years, adopt the sea as a vocation, and it
renders them infinitely more valuable to the
community if they don’t. No sound Austra-
lian wants to decry the Navy or the difficult
work it has to perform, hut thex*e is a native
conservatism about naval men which sees in
anything savoring of change a risk of ren-
dering the Navy “useless as a fighting-
machine.” For instance, it is averred that a
sailor cannot be trained under seven years
of continuous and intensive service—chiefly
because that period was required in the days
of three-deckers and the press-gang. Yet
between 1914 and 1918 many colonels and an
odd general or two were made out of shop-
assistants, police-constables, school-teachers,
farmers and Idle Rich, who prior to the
Great War did not know a trajectory from a
tin of salmon. Naval men are nowadays
eager to explain that sea warfare has changed
—that the modern battleship is simply a
mass of machinery upon which all the old
ideas of seamanship and sail count very little.
Well, if clerks and laborers can be turned
into colonels and brigadiers in four years
by army methods, they should at least be
makeable into A.B.’s, petty-offieers—yea.
even into second-loots —in the same period
by navy ways. If a four-year service, plus
a promise of technical education, will tempt
the raw material for the experiment, why
not give it a trial? It has to be remembered
that in Australia, at any rate, more will be
required to tempt youth than the glory of
a great tradition. Australia has no great
seaboard population which takes to naval
life as naturally as a duck to water; no ever-
menacing pressure of unemployment to make
the “King’s shilling” a boon; and little of
the disposition that will render tolerable a
hard, not overpaid, much-disciplined and
monotonous vocation. Its young men have
to be attracted to the Navy—and held when
attracted. The R.A.N. does not now attract
in anything like the way it should —and must
eventually, if Australia is to live; nor does
it hold. In my limited acquaintance of naval
men are three ex-officers doing clerical work,
an ex-Jervis Bay cadet in a draughting office,
and time-expired ratings acting as liftman,
railway porter and cleaner respectively.

Australian Trade with China.
Captain Patrick, Australian shipowner
and mariner, has just spent three months in
China inquiring into trade possibilities; and
lie writes some conclusions for The Bul-
letin ;
China and the Philippines should be a natural
market for our surplus products. This is the con-
clusion all must come to when we examine the
map, measure the distances and count the popu-
lation.
The total value of the exports and imports between
China and various countries in 1924 was as follows:
Australia .. .. .. £727,840
Canada .. .. .. 1,849,219
Great Britain .. . . 24,540,653
U.S.A 42,187,713
Japan 61,431,286
The above figures show that the geographical posi-
tion has considerable bearing on trade between
countries, but they also prove that, by means of
modern fast services, distant countries can compete
and secure a large share of the business.
Japan, it will be noted, has pride of place so far
as trade with China is concerned, and there may
be many factors making for this; but in my,opinion
facility of transport is most important. Britain,
Canada and the United States have endeavored to
overcome their disability of distance by establishing
large and fast steamers which deliver goods regu-
larly, reliably and unceasingly at the market. Enter-
prising men have established services from Australia,
Ilong Kong, Manila and Japan; but Shanghai, the
greatest city in the Far East, is not touched. In-
sufficient inducement offers, says the shipowner;
there is no regular service, says the Shanghai
importer. Both statements are true, so we have to
consider ways and means to enable Australia to
sell her products in Shanghai at a profit to the
producer, the shipowner and the importer. This can
be achieved by the co-ordination of the three in
order to obtain the maximum efficiency.
I am not a believer in spoonfed, State-aided
industries; but there are occasions when, for the
good of the many, it is legitimate to invoke State
aid to pioneer an industry or line until it is able
to walk by itself. The huge trade of the United
States with Shanghai has been undoubtedly built up
and fostered by the U.S.A. Shipping Board, whose
services, by the way, are being gradually transferred
to private ownership, presumably having fulfilled
their pioneering mission. They have operated at a
loss in actual running, but a great gain in develop-
ing a valuable oversea trade. An individual cannot
be expected to find sufficient capital to produce suit-
able ships to run at a loss for probably two years
for an uncertain future reward. But a Government
can, and should, interest itself in building railway
lines and shipping lines when necessary to open
new country and to find new markets. To compete
with the world wo have to move Australia nearer
the market by means of the most modern and
efficient vessels.
I think we can safely say that, should the Common-
wealth Government Line cease running next week, our
lines of communication with Europe arc quite safe,
as sufficient inducement offers for other lines to
compete for the trade. The same applies to Java
and Singapore. But there is an absolute necessity
for a service to Shanghai to be established after
the exporters and would-be exporters in Australia
have done their part. The exporters must go out
and get the business; they must travel, organise
and devise methods to create a demand for their
goods.
I am sometimes, however, tempted to think that
Australians are too self-satisfied, too comfortable,
have too much of a settled-down-to-play-bowls sort
of feeling, instead of thinking ahead and doing their
utmost, while they have the health and energy, to
get a bigger share of the world’s business for their
children—who, by the way, are apt to grow up just
like we are. It is no good getting old before our
time. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Dollar of
the great Dollar Line, a man of 82, yet full of
the joy of battle and achievement and delight in life.
lie was still buying steamers, organising new lines,
and going round the world doing it himself.

Protection in Unlooked-for Places.
Even the S. M. Herald can’t keep the Pro-
tectionist gospel out of its financial columns,
whatever it may do with the political part
of the paper. Finance is an exact science,
while politics may be an inaccurate gibber-
ing, which makes a difference. On 22/8/’25
the venerated organ published a long writing
from London w r ith an influential name at-
tached, and it might be summarised thus:—
That the condition of England is “unique” for
depression and unemployment, and that a report
from the Federation of British Industries alleges
that the misery “gives every appearance of being
permanent”-—in other words, that there is no
hope. Freetrader Lloyd George endorses this view.
That “neither in Italy nor in Germany is there
anything like the same amount of unemployment
as in England. In the United States and in France
there is none.”
That the whole misery is due to the flood of
imports, and against these silly old Freetrade offers
no defence whatsoever. “In 1913 there was an excess
of imports over exports of £150,000,000. In 1923
the adverse trade balance had increased to
£20.3,000,000. The most recent figures for the 12 (
months ended May last show a rise to
£395,000,000.” The writer added that “there has
been a decrease in the import of raw material,”
because when the mills are closed they don’t require
raw material, “while manufactured goods and con-
sumable commodities show an increase.” The latter
is natural, because when the looms are still they
are not manufacturing local goods, and imported
stuff is used instead.
The Herald’s financial authority might have
added that the local manufacture of baby
was about the worst ease of all. There were
927.062 new infants in England in 1900,
845,814 in 1921, and only 730,286 in 1924.
♦ '
Tom Walsli.
“Hamer” : Many of the stories told about
Tom Walsh’s life in Australia and his con-
nection with Labor are untrue. He first
joined the Sydney branch of the Seamen’s
Union in 1907, before which he did some
work on the wharves; and very shortly he
was appointed Newcastle agent for the
branch. He held much the same opinions
in those days as he does now, except that
he had not then developed his present strong
anti-liquor views. In 1910 Akthub Cooper
(now on the Board of Trade), who was
Sydney branch-secretary and acting-secretary
of the Seamen’s Federation, got the perma-
nent job of secretary of the Federation, and
Walsh, nominating for the branch secre-
taryship, won by a good majority. Cooper’s
record of management was a very fine one.
Before he left the union he established funds
of £20,000, which he proposed to invest for
the benefit of the union’s activities; it was
even suggested that the nucleus of a co-
operative bank might be formed. The big
money has all been dissipated in late strike
upheavals. Walsh had only been in office as
branch secretary for six months when a
special committee was appointed to inquire
into allegations of mismanagement; but its
recommendations, which were not favorable
to the secretary, were defeated at a special
general meeting. The trouble came up again,
however, and Walsh, after another inquiry,
ceased to hold his job. He went to sea, and
was not heard of for a few years; then ho
fathered, a resolution in the Melbourne
branch to the effect that no Masons should
be permitted to hold office in the union—a
motion which, being carried, led to
the passing out (to Walsh’s advant-
age) of secretary Gibson, one of the
best officers the union has had. A
later resolution excluded returned soldiers
from holding office. Amongst the effects of
this was to stop a very fine type of
unionist) Alec Campbell, who had been
Newcastle agent for the union, from getting
his job back when he returned from the war,
to which he had gone in spite of being over
40, a married man and the father of several
children ; but the wider effect of both resolu-
tions was to increase the hold of Walsh,
who had been elected Federal Secretary when
Cooper moved on. From the very nature of
the members’ occupation the affairs of the
Seamen’s Union are mainly controlled by its
officers; and so many bars to the holding of
office have been set up that Walsii has
found it much easier than he otherwise would
to retain his grip.

Judges Great and Little.
From time to time judicial appointments are
made that exercise the public mind, suggest-
ing whether the method adopted secures the
best possible Bench in the best possible way.
Some of these appointments serve a political
purpose, and should subsequent merit justify
them it is by grace of fortune rather than
by excellence of the process of selection. The
subject was discussed in 11. J. Lasky’s
recent “Grammar of Politics,” which once
again called attention to the anomaly that to
accept appointment to a judgeship in the
lower courts is practically to exclude the
appointee from advancement to a higher
branch of the judiciary. “Yet,” the author
says, “it is not less important in the judiciary
than elsewhere that the man whoso services
in a lower court are really distinguished
should have a reasonable assurance of pro-
motion on recognition of them.” There should
not, of course, be any hard and fast rule of
advancement by seniority, for that would not
secure the required qualifications; but, as
Lasky says, “we do not want an able
Judge to feel that he will be passed over for
some clever political hack who has known
how to press his claims at the right time.”
There have been instances in most, if not all,
the States where men have been taken direct
from the Bar to the Supreme Court with
less known qualification and experience than
those of individual Judges in the District or
County Courts. It has, however, become a
convention that a lower-court Judge shall
not, under ordinary circumstances, receive
promotion in his office to the higher court, no
matter how outstanding his ability may be.
Of all customs and conventions those of the
legal craft are probably the hardest to set
aside. Tradition counts there for so much.
Law moves slowly from precedent to pre-
cedent and abhors the ruptures of reform as
thoroughly as Nature does a vacuum. In
any business enterprise the first thing the
employer or manager does, when filling a
high post in his organisation, is to cast his
eye down the list of existing employees for
the most capable man to fill it. That is just
to his men and wisdom in his business. It
is only when he finds no such fitting officer
that he goes outside the staff. But in law
the rule is to go outside. It may indeed be
highly desirable to do so in certain cases,
but it should not harden into a rule that, in
effect, operates as a boycott of men with
years of specialised judicial experience at
their command. A tried Judge of the lower
court who has made but a small name at
the Bar may be a fitter occupant of a seat
on the Supreme Court Bench than a success-
ful advocate without the judicial tempera-
ment. The fact that the latter has a large
practice and a handsome income is no more
ground of qualification than that he may In 1
an astute and tactful politician. What is
suggested is that when a vacancy occurs in
a superior court a committee of the Judges
should present to the responsible Minister
a list of, say, three names from the Judges
of the lower court, from whom he shall select
one for promotion, provided, of course, the com-
mittee thinks any of them worthy of the post.
“The danger that a political protege will be
too rapidly advanced can easily be met,” Mr.
Lasky rightly argues, “by requiring that no
Judge shall be advanced who has not served
for five years in his present position; and
the danger of merely promoting senior Judges
could be met by the pi’oviso that no Judge
who is less than five years from the age of
retm'-'-ent shall be recommended for pro-
motion.”

LIVE AGENTS WANTED EVERYWHERE.
The Bolshevism that Pays No Dividends.
There arc two ways in which the “worker"
may attempt to improve his condition, apart
from the scattering of loan funds, which may
serve for a time but only makes the position
worse when the interest bill comes home.
One is to produce more and of better quality
and demand a fair share of the results. The
other is to produce Jess and worse, and de-
mand an impossible share of the results.
Ten years ago an “advanced” Labor
party got into office in Queensland,
and it has kept in, by many devices, includ-
ing shady ones, ever since. Its message to
the workers was that laziness, slovenliness,
disobedience to the authority of their own
democratic institutions, and the cultivation
of an attitude of chronic grievance and in-
civility were the earmarks of Liberty. Ryan
dropped the Premiership because he wanted
to enter the Federal arena, and an election
was at hand, and a safe seat, presented itself.
Theodore abandoned the same high office
ostensibly because he also wanted to enter
the Federal arena, but really, it would seem,
to get away from the monster he had done
so much to create —-from the bankrupt rail-
ways (losses, 12 millions in 10 years) and
the impending 44-hour week which was
bound to make them more bankrupt, from
the perpetual strikes, and from the decay of
everything, including the Government’s
authority. The Theodore Government did
all in its power to benefit the “worker,” if
the supply of facilities for loafing, bad work-
manship and insubordination were benefits.
Its reward was of the same kind as came
to the F'ederal authority when, by dipping into
consolidated revenue to the extent of a mil-
lion or so p.a., it made its socialistic ship-
ping line the best-paid and best-conditioned
service of its sort in the world. The com-
plete stoppage of the Queensland railway ser-
vice as soon as the boon of the 44-hour week
came to hand may be ingratitude, but it
was part of the ordinary course of events.
The principal demands numbered three. One
was the restoration of the 5 p.c. wage reduc-
tion made in 1922 in an effort to save a
situation which was even then bad to the
verge of rottenness. Another, which appears
to have been in the nature of an afterthought,
was a five-day week of 36f hours for rail-
way clerks. The third was permission to
bring the service to a standstill any day, any-
where and for any length of time, in order
to hold meetings and discuss “grievances,”
of which there are always plenty. There
may be 16 different unions in the railway
service, but they struck as one. The Com-
monwealth Government became involved by
the stoppage of mail trains —the mails were
declared “black” —the Mt. Morgan mine
closed down, throwing 1600 men out of work,
sugar-mills ceased crushing cane, and out-
back towns began to ration their scanty stocks
of flour, sugar, butter and potatoes. From
the outset it was evident that the pigeon-
livered Labor Government would capitulate
to the strikers; the only question was
whether its surrender would be made through
the Arbitration Court or by embodying the
wage rate demanded in a special Act of
Parliament. In effect, the Government signi-
fied its willingness to purchase a temporary
peace with dishonor by levying on the tax-
payers and laying up more and woi’se trouble.
And the same sort of Labor Government has
entered upon a course of action which will
lead to the same results in N. S. Wales.

Seaways and Airways.
General Harbobd, president of the Radio
Corporation of America, recently put it that
the submarine method of telegraphy is out
of date. His view is not, apparently, shared
by his own Government and the Governments
of at least four other countries. Amongst
the cable extensions planned this year are
one from Italy to the Azores, another from
U.S.A. to Britain, and several German ones.
In addition the Eastern Extension Co. has
put in a fresh link between Singapore and
Java, which will speed up Australian com-
munications with the projected base;
another is to be paid out between Cocos
Island, where the Emden’s bones lie, and
Perth ; and the Pacific Cable Board intends
to strengthen its under-water communications
between Canada and Australia. Altogether
26,000 miles of the expensive gutta-percha-
covered wire have been contracted for. Most
of the new cables are “loaded” ; that is to
say, they are wound inductively at several
points along their length. The brilliant
Oliver Heaviside, Malcolm and others
pointed out many years ago that this device
would enable cables to work at twice to
twenty times their ordinary speed; but the
monopoly enjoyed by the huge cable combine
did not make for strenuous exploitation of
the fancies of armchair theorists. The
threat of wireless competition has led the
cable concerns to shake this card out of their
sleeve, and it is likely to prove a very effec-
tive chip. Australia, being a shareholder in
the big State-owned Pacific cable, and like-
wise being pledged to erect a beam wireless
system to work with Britain, is vitally
interested in the relative efficiency of the two
methods. The defect of the radio method is
that the utmost concentration of the beam
cannot prevent it shedding its information
over a wide area of country in the same
lavish way that a searchlight sheds its light.
It is therefore not a perfect means of com-
munication when secrecy is needed. In the
event of hostilities breaking out in the inter-
national ether it is also obvious that the
station with the loudest voice would be likely
to shout the others down. Further, the
lightning-flash and the radio signal being com-
posed of the same material, the wireless re-
ceiving instrument, with its ear open to the
air. is liable to irritating interruptions from
which the submarine cable is comparatively
exempt. The sensational success of Australian
amateurs in picking up the songs of Eskimos
and the sneezes of polar-bears is not suffi-
cient ground for supposing the day of under-
water communication is done. The successes
reported are only achieved after hours’ of
weary waiting, and the amount of business
traffic that could be conveyed from Sydney
to Greenland under present conditions would
be negligible and liable to some delay. There
is no doubt that wireless has a future of
incalculable promise, and the Commonwealth,
which is getting on well with its beam
station, is justified in nudging the Baldwin
Government with vigor to get on with its end
AS IN THE DAYS OF OLD .
“In times of national excitement the prophets of Baal had the odd habit of leaping on their own idols.”
of the scheme. Wireless working is cheap
if somewhat leisurely, and its chief function
for the present will probably be the useful
one of carrying the inexpensive message of
congratulation and the non-urgent expression
of condolence. Just as the supplying of
earth-born man with wings has not led yet
to the atrophy of his legs, so wireless has
not yet shown any indication of supplant-
ing with its simplicity and ease the certainty,
secrecy and carrying capacity of the enor-
mous under-water system.

About ten months ago (in October) Camp-
bell, an Australian, was driven to proceed
against Johanson, a Dutchman, whom the
local seamen employ as assistant-secretary of
their union, for an order that the Dutchman
should not prevent him earning his livelihood
by declaring him a bad or bogus unionist.
The Court made the order, and the person
against whom it was made took no more
notice than if the Court had been a thistle.
He just went on offending. Later (in April)
the Australian asked the Court to have the
Dutchman locked up if he wouldn’t obey.
The order was granted, but the Dutchman,
being resolved to continue malignant if he
could do so with impunity, went to an
appeal, and lost that. The Australian was
fighting with his own money, and the Dutch-
man presumably with the Australian sea-
men’s money. Finally, the other day, the
Dutchman was hauled into court for a final
round. Then lie offered (or his lawyer did)
the astounding assurance that it was all a
sort of mental misprint. He had never
meant to flout the order of the Court, though
he had done so for months, and had fought
hard for a chance to persevere in his course
of persecution, and he offered his unsupported
assertion that he would leave off. Whereupon
he was discharged with an order to pay that
one day’s costs. There wax no penalty for all
his contumacy. As regards the costs of the pre-
vious actions which the foreigner fought and
lost (£l2O to £150), the Court wasn’t so rude
as to tell the Australian to whistle for them,
but it explained that he could chase them at
his’ own charge through a lot more courts.
Fossibly he won't. For an Australian to
pursue a truculent Hollander under Austra-
lian law is a profitless business.
Well-meaning politicians in the Ma State
propose making an honest effort to meddle
with the middleman and “to trace the causes
of the disparity in prices and the alleged
waste of valuable foodstuffs.” To this end
it is proposed “to call together a conference
of primary producers and consumers,” leav-
ing the middleman, who ought to know most
about himself, out altogether. The sheep,
or the owner of the sheep, and the man who
wears the woollen shirt shall meet, it is
suggested, and confer on the monetary dis-
crepancy between the sheep and the shirt.
The result will be, as usual, a very big re-
port with very little in it. A better way
might be, to put on a gang of men, each an
expert in his line and gifted with the detec-
tive instinct, and give them unlimited powers
to follow each his own thread of investiga-
tion. Meat is a prolific subject of com-
plaint. It being a large subject several ex-
perts might be attached to a herd when it
left its original home, whether it was Mona-
ro, West Queensland or the Territory. The
Territory would furnish most experience.
When it gained its destination, after adven-
ture, expense and loss, they could attach
themselves to their pet bullock and not let
it out of sight till it ended up in the saddlery
shop, the bone depot, the hair mattress, and
the garbage tin in the back yard. Milk,
wool (locally consumed), eggs, coal, fish,
fruit and the like could be followed the same
way. Subsidiary watchers could be detached
from the main body at the proper time to
keep track of by-products and offal. In Un-
building line the investigation should be easy.
The State has its own forests, sawmills, brick-
yard and cement works. It has its own ex-
perts to build cottages on its own land at
Gladesville, beside its own lunatic asylum,
and its Rocks Resumption Board or Repatri-
ation Department to collect rents and show
a fair profit. Then it can look up the re-
cords of its trawling department and fish-
shops, and see if that evidence is of any
value. The reports should be better reading
than blue libraries of evidence, especially
those of the man who shadowed the bullock
from Newcastle Waters to Homebush, and
his city confrere who then took up the run-
ning.

Since R. S. Ross's lament in The Bulle-
tin for the lost art of oratory there has been
a revival of dialectics in the Universities
which should do a good deal to stop the rot.
The visit of the bright debaters of the Oxford
Union last May kindled enthusiasm amongst
the students, and the result in Melbourne
has been the emergence of two political clubs
and three new debating societies, all within
the last couple of months. The undergradu-
ate is thus going to get larger opportunities
to practise the art of making himself articu-
late. The Melbourne dailies have done wisely
in taking the young clubs to their hearts.
When the Professorial Board decided to allow
Labor and Liberal clubs to be formed within
the Uni., the Age remarked that it was just
as well the chairman’s casting vote went the
way it did; and the Herald gave the clubs
an encouraging nod. It is possible that the
groups, if they persist, will some day become
strong enough to force our unlettered poli-
tical gamesters to pay the same attention
to the ’Varsities as training-grounds for
statesmen as the English parties have found
it profitable to devote to the unions at
Oxford and Cambridge. On present appear-
ances none will benefit so much as the parties
which refuse to accept the Labor yoke. In
every State the complaint is the same—
whereas Labor gives its young men frequent
opportunities of public speech, the non-Labor
bodies offer no training-grounds. Their plat-
forrns are occupied consequently by chi-
stagers, their imagination (if they ever had
any) dulled, and short of that enthusiasm
without which it is hard to win elections or
anything else.

“X2X”: A convicted person recently
appealed to the Judge at the Darlinghurst
(Sydney) Sessions not to send him to prison,
urging that he was suffering from
tuberculosis. The plea was unsuccessful:
raised in almost any other State it would
have had consideration. In Victoria and
Queensland a prisoner with T.B. is invari-
ably released on bond as soon as his com-
plaint is definitely diagnosqd, and should he
contract the disease while serving a sentence
the rest of his time is generally remitted.
But in N. S. Wales the penal authorities
claim to have suitable provision at Long-
Bay for tubercular patients, and would pro
bably contend that such sufferers are just as
well off there as in some sanitarium or roam-
ing about at large. In severe or far-advanced
cases release may be hoped for, but not other-
v. r ise.

“C.E.F.”: Most railway accidents are due
to bad tracks; “Loco” (B. 9/7/’25) can
rest assured that buffers have no more to do
with derailments than brass domes have
with speed. Tasmania uses the side buffer
on the 3ft. 6in., and shows much faster
time than has ever been attained in
Queensland. As for the curves and over-
hang, in Canada the cars are at least a foot
wider than in N. S. Wales, and I have
ridden on the C.P.R. and the G. Trunk at
w'ell over 60 around curves and never noticed
the swaying that is noticeable between Syd-
ney and Albury. The N. S. Wales track is
in my opinion the hardest riding of any
4ft. 81in. gauge in the world. In England
the curves are elevated for speed, and the
one west of Taunton station is usually
passed by the eastbound “Riviera” at an
SO average; the same with the one west of
Reading. The Great Western railway gives
the fastest service in the world to the West
of England ; 2hrs. to Bristol, 3hrs. to Exeter
and 4hrs. 7min. to Plymouth, 1181, 173 and
227 miles respectively; it is much smoother
and faster than any of the sft. 3in. lines in
Ireland. I have sampled the Trans, train
and found it as inferior to the splendid steel
trains of Canada as the puny engines are
compared with those on the Canadian fliers.
The new engines for the S.A.R. are going to
be big affairs, but are by no means the biggest
in the world, and these will not be of much
use unless a staff exchanger is installed and
the slacking at stations for tablet exchange
abolished on the expresses.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Warnings have been issued, mostly by im-
ported persons, that if any imported person
is sent home for being a rowdy nuisance
heavy weather accompanied by thunder will
set in, and they (the imported speakers) will
not be answerable for the consequences.
There have been a few deportations, includ-
ing Tom Barker, Paul Freeman, Jock V il-
son and, in particular, an Irish priest and
layman who, at the worst, were only plan-
ning revolution in Ireland, while the others
wanted to engineer it here. Each time there
was a frothy little row, followed by a period
of comparative calm, and the “martyrs”
dropped out of memory. Then another im-
ported noise-maker would try his luck, and,
finding the ejection machinery very slow and
fitful, he would go on trying. Irregularity
and uncertainty in the starting of the de-
portation boat is the cause of much trouble.
Papua and the Mandated Territory have
been exempted from the operation of the
Navigation Act, which threatened to make
them as desolate as the walls of Balclutha.
That is good as far as it goes, but what is
needed is the remoulding of the Navigation
Act to the end of giving the shipping indus-
try adequate protection instead of giving the
Seamen’s Union a coastal monopoly which its
foreign bosses have wickedly abused. The
Walsh-Johanson-Casey gang would be de-
prived of most of its power for mischief if
the coastal monopoly was abolished.
The passionate announcement of Premier
Lang that none of the powers at the com-
mand of the N.S.W. Government will help
to arrest or deport anybody should set the
Federal authorities thinking. The Canberra
metropolis, for example, has an abundance
of drawbacks, one of them being that it is
sui'rounded by N.S.W. territory, and that
the Ma State holds the keys, in the shape
of the railways. Berlin, Rio de Janeiro,
Pretoria and some other capitals are served
by Federal railways. A multitude of other
So far as Thb: Bulletin knows, this is
the first time in the history of trades union-
ism that the unions of one country have been
cajoled or misled into openly attempting to
destroy the authority of the unions of an-
other country.
The Labor party has ratted on so many
of its pre-war principles that the spectacle
of Federal Labor boisterously approving ot
a State Government’s passive resistance to
Commonwealth law excited no surprise.
Federal Labor used to stand for the aboli-
tion of State Governments. In 1910 it passed
an Act providing that the annual payments
to the States out of the Customs and Excise
revenue should cease in ten years. The pay-
ments have been continued by the Bruee-Page
Government, but the cost of the Federal
police force necessitated by the Lang crowd s
refusal to let the State police touch its Bed
friends should certainly be deducted from the
Ma State’s share. So should Queensland be
debited with the expense of procuring the
delivery of mails which the Government rail-
way strikers, without resistance from the
faint-hearted Gillies Ministry, declared
“black.”

capitals, from London and Paris to AVash-

Passed out, Conrad von Hoetzendorff, com-
mander-in-chief of the Austrian army m the
Great War, though most of the time Ger-
mans really ran the show, lie was easily
the most stupid generalissimo m either
crowd—-so stupid that even Francis Joseph,
who was no small ass himselt, noticed it at
last. C. von Hoetz. retired with a pension
of 25,000 crowns (£1043 or so), but all this
paper depreciated till it was worth 2d or
less, so the fallen warrior opened a village
tobacco-shop and swapped Ins uniforms for
stock-in-trade. All manner of thickheaded
Communists kept explaining to Aus-
tralia at this time that Government notes
“secured on all the public and private assets
of the country” required no gold backing.
Conrad’s pile of paper was secured on the
whole durned lot, including the Danube and
the Imperial jewels, and all the palaces of
Vienna, but they didn’t help much.
The resolutions passed by the Star
Chamber in charge of the Queensland rail-
way strike included one recommending that
any storekeeper or trader refusing credit to
railway workers on strike be declared
“black.” For a similar example of black-
mail it is necessary to go to China. There
the agent of the Robbers' Guild regularly
calls on shopkeepers and collects a tax, cal-
culated according to the value of the stock,
leaving a burglary-exemption certificate in
exchange. The Chinese police, like the,
Queensland Labor Government, being fright-
ened allies of the lawbreakers, the Celestial
butcher or grocer usually pays up.
Vic. Federal Labor had its tongue in its
cheek when, having no hope in the wide
world of winning the seat, it decided not to
nominate a candidate to fill the vacancy in
the Senate, said vacancy “having been caused
by the death of a Nationalist member.” This
would have made a fine precedent for future
use if Labor hadn’t spoiled the beautiful and
most virtuous gesture by voting solidly, not
for the Nationalist candidate, Plain, but for
his Country party opponent, Hall. Of course
Plain won.
The Federal Government should not let this
session close without amending the misshaped
measure which provides for some sort of Par-
liamentary representation for the Northern
Territory. At present the man who may
speak but not vote in the House
of Reps, must at the time of elec-
tion be an N.T. resident; and since the N.T.
has been all but depopulated, the provision
reduces the possible spokesmen to a very
small handful —in effect, almost gives the job
to one of a few union officials, than whom
less satisfactory reps, could scarcely be
found. Vet there arc scores of men who have
spent years in the Territory and been at last
driven out of it who would make capital
spokesmen —they at least do know what is
the matter with the place. If the present;
absurd condition were struck out it would
still be open to the electors to choose a local
man; but it is little less than an insult not
to trust them to choose for themselves. Pro-
bably it wasn’t intended to be an insult; it
was only intended to be a job.
At last something is to be done to encour-
age the making of good Australian photo-
plays, and it is a State Government that is
doing it. In a Vic. bill providing for the
better censoring of celluloid offal, Chief Sec.
Argyle has had a provision inserted that
after January 1, 1927, there shall be shown
at every cinema show such a length of Brit-
ish or British Dominion films as shall be
prescribed. Argyle argues that this require-
ment will mean no hardship, and that the
public is getting sick of Hollywood smut and
slop, and he is right in each particular.
Richardson, Minister for Forests, who has
charge of Argyle’s measure in the Leg. Coun-
cil, declared that imported pictures were
counteracting the work of the teachers in the
State schools. What was the use of spend-
ing millions on education, he asked, when
the school kiddies had “pumped into their
heads” on Saturday afternoons filth from
the picture theatres? The bill aims at sup-
plementing the work of the Commonwealth
censor. It is intended, in fact, to make the
Federal censor the State watchdog also, and
to extend his powers so that he may sub-
edit posters and ads., which are sometimes
worse than the film itself.
The Law is an elaborate ass. A man in
the Federal air service who had no motor
license was charged with driving a car in the
busiest part of Melbourne. The case was
defended on the plea that State regulations
didn't apply to Federal employees, who could
drive anything, anywhere and anyhow. Appa-
rently they could do 200 miles per hour on
the wrong side of the road without lights.
The magistrate dismissed the case, the State
had to appeal, and five High Court Judges
at £15,500 per annum sat on the problem till
it was nearly addled. By a bare majority
they decided that unlicensed Federal officials
must not drive over people, and made it Is.
without costs. It would have_ been wiser it
the Federal Government hadn't argued such
a point; but it appears to be the idea of the
Federal Law Department that its chief busi-
ness is to argue everything. Somebody might
inquire into the cost of this amiable weak-
ness.
The beginning of the end of Melbourne's
cable-tram system has arrived; August 29
was the appointed date for the death rattle
of the St. Kilda Esplanade cable; ’buses on
the Chapel-street to Esplanade route take
the place of the old cars, and about the end
of the year the electric system will get to
work on all lines. Meantime heavy taxation
is gradually pushing the privately-owned
motor-’buses off the streets. From one point
of view it is quite wrong—if ’buses give the
better service the public ought to have them.
But we have always fooled ourselves into
believing, that railways and tramways bought
with borrowed money are “permanent
works’’; and even to this day. when we know
they are not, we do nothing to pay off their
cost out of revenue.
Semi-Communistic Governments find the
higher education a nuisance. History teaches
that many of their legislative devices are
claptrap, and have been tried over and over
again with no success; political economy sug-
gests that their professedly new financial
schemes are often stale and old; law is bad
for their precedents, and logic shows that
they ramble in their reasoning. It wasn’t
out of keeping, therefore, that Minister
Mutch should assure a Bathurst deputation
that universities outside Sydney arc absurd,
and that to send wandering lecturers to the
country from Sydney Uni. is little good,
which is true. He recommended teaching
by correspondence, which is no good at all.
To learn surgery by letter is beyond possi-
bility, and the getting of a correct French
accent by telegraph is almost worse.
Sir George Buchanan thinks the high cost
of material landed in the Northern Terri-
tory “positively alarming.” It is; yet it is
moderate compared with the cost of the
material that went via Cape Horn, the Isth-
mus of Panama and per prairie schooners to
the west of the United States in pre-railway
days. The same high cost applied to the in-
dustrial opening of the Transvaal over 40
years ago, and to the settlement of the West-
ralian goldfields in the early ’nineties. It
applied at a slightly later date to the Klon-
dyke and Alaska generally. Yet who gives
a regretful thought now to the original cost
of opening up those wealth-producers?
Labor in Victoria is likely to throw the
Eight Hours Day procession overboard.
When the successful battle for eight hours
was still in memory, the marcher could bear
himself as a sturdy warrior who had declined
to sit down calmly under bad conditions; but.
the Eight Hours Day being now an accepted
thing and the struggle for an even shorter
one having begun, there is nothing to sus-
tain enthusiasm. Yearly the number of the
marchers decreases until the procession is
now merely a sequence of lorries with ban-
ners and trade shows. 80, whilst unionists
will cling to the holiday and the sports, and
some of the old hands are sentimentally
opposed to any change, the Trades Hall is
considering the question of alteration; and
it is practically certain that the procession
will be dropped.
This talk of class and class-war bears some
queer fruit. Instead of being properly
ambitious to get out of the ruck and take an
overseer’s job along with an overseer’s pay,
hundreds of apparently intelligent young men
in Australia’s biggest industries refuse their
firm’s overtures to qualify by taking (at
the firm’s expense) a course of tech-
nical training. Australia hasn’t any great
number of factories yet, and some of those it
has complain that it is far more difficult to
get foremen than plain rank and file. In one
industry recently a circular was sent out to
a thousand workmen telling them there were
jobs waiting for foremen, and inviting em-
ployees to take a free course of training to
qualify for big pay. It got two replies,
neither of them from men of even average
quality. The rest, who took no notice, merely
want to qualify apparently for the job of
denouncing the tyranny of the boss.
A BALLAD OF NINEPENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Hengest sailed the Northern sea
With great affairs in hand,
In a grey port of Germany
lie brought his ships to land.
“Rest here a while, my seamen hold,
And load with corn and beef;
For we shall have, to win and hold,
A treasure past belief.
“To-day we know but stress and toil,
But westward o’er the sea
<>ur sons shall find a native soil
Of herd and hive and tree.
By fruit of seed that now we sow
Our future race shall thrive,
And peace in Kentish orchards grow
From these sea ploughs we drive.”
t'p spake young Wulferc from the deck,
A sneer upon his face:
“W e care not if your ships should wreck
Or rot here in this place.
We care not if our race should breed
To greatness far away,
But our demands we bid you heed
For ninepencc more a day!”
And there had been no Angle-land ,
No English vision clear ,
If Hengest had not raised his hand
To smile the mutineer.
When Drake, aboard the Golden Hind,
Had passed the bleak Cape Horn
The waters of the west to find
Whereto his race was born.
He saw a pageant of great ships,
Dream-freighted, cross the sea,
With England’s glory on men’s lips
To all eternity.
But wherefore should men man the yard
And spread the canvas white?
Why strive with cordage frozen hard
For other men’s delight ?
Ho! bold Sir Francis, give us ease
Of these great toils we do.
And discontent like a disease
Swept o’er the muttering crew.
And there had been a sudden end
Of England’s sea-born hope,
But for the swift-turned hangman's bend
Upon the dangling rope.
When Britain, after awful throes
Of war, arose in might
A thousand deadlier silent foes
To vanquish in the fight,
The long blue pathways of the sea
Were still the freeman’s way,
And all the hope of things to be
In shipmen’s honor lay.
Then rose young Wulfere on the deck,
A sneer upon his face:
“We care not if your ships should wreck
Or rot here in this place.
We care not if our race should breed
Or want and famine slay,
But our demands we bid you heed
For ninepence more a day ! ”
Now who shall fall and who shall stand
for Britain’s sea-borne hope?
Has Hengest still a mighty hand,
And Francis Brahe a rope?

“ J.H.M.A.”: I was one of those present
at the most curious lirst production that it
has been anybody’s lot to witness.. It was
that of Louise Lovely’s Australian film,
LOGIC.
“Why are you going to May's party when
you hate her, and not going to Peggy's
when you like her ?”
“ Stupid—Peggy has SEEN my new dress,
hasn’t she?”
“Jewelled Nights,” and the theatre in which
it had its initial screening was the chapel
at Long Bay (N.S.W.) prison. We turned
up for early doors a little before 2 o’clock on
a Saturday afternoon, signed our names in
the visitors’ book in the guard-room, and
were conducted across the yard to the office,
where we were welcomed by the Comptroller-
General and other officials. As we walked
round to the entrance to the chapel, and
passed “B” Hall, where the gallows is, I
could not but recall two other performances
which I had seen staged there at an earlier
hour of the day—one-man shows where there
were no encores —and experienced a sense of
relief that this was not a similar divertisse-
ment. “Jewelled Nights” is a good film, well
acted and photographed, and wholly Aus-
tralian. And there were singers, reciters and
a violin soloist who were excellent. But it is
not the picture and the concert party that
one is most conscious of during the two hours
spent in this singular variety show. Those
pale-faced men in the hideous grey clothing
behind, and the invisible women in the gal-
lery above them, all so enthusiastic in their
applause, surely constitute the most sym-
pathetic audience that was ever collected at
any show. There is no half-heartedness
about their appreciation, no coldness in their
reception of funny stuff, not a trace of super-
ciliousness or boredom. _ They have been
marched hither from their cells, and will
go back to eat bread and hominy in them
whilst we are having afternoon tea with the
superintendent—but for at least two hours
out of the 168, over 100 of which are spent
in their cells, they have had a chance to
feel like human beings whom someone is
interested in. It is one of the best things
the N.S.W. prison administration has to its
credit, that weekly bit of relaxation, and
those who assist in it, professionals and ama-
teurs, may well take credit to themselves on
Saturday nights, after the fashion of the Boy
Scout, for having done one good deed during
the day.
* * * *
“Globe”: A Melbourne lady travelling to
England stayed for a day or two in a U.S.
city where she had reason to believe some
distant relatives of her family lived, and
decided to try to get in touch with them on
the telephone. She found the name (her own
maiden one), and getting the number asked
for Mrs. Hemphill. A soft, cultured voice
announced “Mrs. Hemphill speaking.” The
traveller explained that she was from Aus-
tralia, and was wondering if the lady’s hus-
band was a relative she was seeking. “Are
you white?” came back. Recovering from
the shock, a trifle heatedly the visitor
assured the questioner that she was. “Then/’
said the same soft voice, “I’m afraid we can’t
claim relationship. .We are colored.”
* * * *
“O’Ren”: Enter this among the quaint
courtships. Bill from Bananaungaree or
something like it was consigned to the care
of the local constable for being very drunk
and exceedingly disorderly. As the cells
were in the station-yard, the prisoner had an
excellent opportunity to become acquainted
with the family. The p.c. had a pleasant
daughter, and as Bill was not at all unpre-
sentable, the acquaintance ripened into an
engagement before the seven days’ sentence
had been served. The constable, a broad-
minded man who bore no grudges for the
trouble occasioned by William’s arrest, gave
his approval to the match ; two months later
all three appeared before a clerical “beak”
to hear the life sentence pronounced.
* * * *
“Country Ped”: Owing, presumably, to
Government parsimony there is not a single
State school in Melbourne equipped with a
central heating system. Every room has a
small fireplace, either in the centre of one
long wall or in a far corner. Still, if
only these fireplaces were used regu-
larly, the biting cold of a winter’s day
would be slightly alleviated. As it is,
indifferently-clad children sit shiver-
ing before a top-coated teacher in a
vitiated atmosphere, the windows being-
kept closed in order to create some
warmth. It is not the headmaster’s
fault. Each receives a monthly allow-
ance for the maintenance of his school,
including the purchase of firewood. In
the country w'ood is cheap, and often
a generous committee-man will run a
waggon-load into the school ground for
nothing, but headmasters of the city
schools find it impossible to supply
sufficient fuel for a school
of 12 rooms with only 4s.
6d. a week available. The
matter has reached such a
pass that in one school each
child who can do so
marches in every morning
with a piece of wood
brought from home; while
in another one parent,
anxious for the welfare of
his daughter, supplies the firewood for the
room in which she is taught.
* * * *
“Feng-Shui”: The Naval Research Lab-
oratory of America has just announced that
the earth has a roof. This will be no news
to the Malays, who have always contended
that the heavens were floored with the same
materials as their own houses, the rain and
the stars being due to the defectiveness of
the Celestial plumbing. Their proofs were
entirely empirical, however; whereas Heavi-
side, the English mathematician who died
in poverty early this year, proved it by
figures. The Yankee investigators might
have made him some acknowledgment. The
theory is that the onslaught of the sun’s
rays on the earth’s atmosphere ionises the
air-particles, and that a solid ceiling as im-
pervious to electric waves as a roof of lead
is thus clamped down on this spinning globe.
The ceiling lifts and sags with the alternations
of night and day, its average height being
about 100 miles. Since our signals cannot
penetrate it, Mars will never hear synco-
pated melody or W. M. Hughes. On the
other hand, if it weren’t for the roof, the
Rev. Ruth’s sermons would wander off into
the empyrean and be lost, instead of bounc-
ing back.
* * * *
“Lomra”: Consistency and a sense of pro-
portion are not the strong suit of the most
assertive animal-lovers. They made an
astonishing amount of noise about the caging
of three tiger-cubs which had never known,
nor their parents before them, any life but
that of a cage; and they are clamoring to
save the galahs which, myriads strong, are

a farmer’s pest, and could safely be thinned
out by a few thousands. But I never heard
the tiniest squeak of protest about the trans-
fer to U.S. warships of helpless native ani-
mals as The well-grown wallaby
given one of the boats is already dead of
sea-sickness or home-sickness or unsuitable
tucker, or all three. Certainly it had an
official funeral, but the anticipation of that
couldn’t console an animal. This wretched
pet was, it is true, a Zoo inmate, but at least
it had always lived in the open paddock
with grass under its feet and the twitter of
sister-native birds about it. Think of its
fate—cooped in the steel and teak of a battle-
ship, fed on kitchen scraps, incessantly
pawed by a thousand strangers, its delicate
ears tortured by the unceasing throb of en-
gines! And what of the wild Nagambie joey
given to another battleship?
* * * *
“Nimshi” : The only “bolting bride” whom
I remember was made of sterner stuff than
“Merris’s” temperamental damsel (B.
16/7/’25). The ceremony took place at a
wayside Central Q. pub owned by the bride’s
father. At 11 a.m. the newly-wedded, pail-
emerged therefrom and started on their 10-
mile drive to the ’groom’s residence. At 11
p.m. the bride recrossed the parental thresh-
old, after walking the whole way back:
and there the matter (save for conjecture)
ended. From that hour she would neither
see her husband nor treat with him in-
directly. Even when a fatal illness seized
him, and efforts were made to effect a death-
bed reconciliation, the lady remained
adamant, thereby forfeiting a comfortable
widow’s portion.
* * * * t
“Sixenate” : Two curious obsessions were
disclosed in a couple of cases at the Mel-
bourne City Court the other morning. A
Scotch master-carrier, apparently one of
those stern souls who will pursue a burgled
threepence to the rim of perdition, was the
chief witness against a man charged with
larceny from a van. He mentioned proudly
that, through Ills aid, no less than 52 offend-
ers had been convicted of similar acts of
petty pilfering, and the Court promptly
raised the tally to 53. The watching must
have taken much time and trouble; but, con-
sidered as a hobby, it was doubtless worth
it. In the other case the man with the
obsession was the defendant. He explained
that he hated all kinds of Greeks, and when
he got a few drinks aboard the antipathy
had to be manifested in some practical way.
That was the reason why he had broken the
window of a Greek restaurant, not for the
first time either. The Hellenophobe was a
Scotchman, too; those keen feelings over
matters that the average man forbears to
worry about seem to be characteristic ot
Scots.
* * *
“Wiremu”: I don’t pretend to understand
it; I merely state the facts. A few years
ago I was the guest of a well-to-do Maor<
who had taken for his second wife an Eng-
lish woman. In one of the looms wet.
some handsome mats and ornaments of native
manufacture, lhe door of this room wa.
opposite my bedroom. One day whilst res.-
ing I was surprised to see a handsome
Maori girl enter the mat room and return in
the direction of the kitchen. I didn’t take
much notice, for, although the house was
at least a mile by water from our nearest
neighbor, visitors were continually calling m
on their journeyings up and down Queen
Charlotte Sound. At lunch-time, half an
hour afterwards, seeing no strange girl at
the table, I inquired about her and was
told there had been no visitors that day.
My hostess also denied that she had been
in that part of the house during the morning,
but on seeing my mystification said she knew
wlio the visitor was. She then brought an
album out of one of the rooms and showed
me a photo of the face of the girl I had
seen. She was my host’s first wife, and
had died about three years before. _ My
hostess informed me that several Maori per-
sons had seen the lady enter the mat room.
I had not seen the photo before, so the
face could not have been impressed on my
memory, and I will also swear that I was
wide awake when the ghost walked.

SEPTEMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like words of some old song I scarce remember
Because the voice that sung it once is still,
Softly the sounds and sights of mild September
Break into being over plain and hill.
Not with the painted wistfulness of autumn,
Nor sated languor of a summer noon,
When scents die on the very winds that brought
them,
But with a strange effulgence, like the moon.
Chill yellow dawns the sere brown hills are flushing,
The dew-wet buds still deep in spangled trance,
While o’er the creeks and hilltops there come rushing
Warm promises of love and young Romance 1
What is the whispering among the grasses,
The melody the ’raptured magpies fling
To every fitful, odorous gust that passes
And every sun-glint on the burnished wing ?
Some half-heard fantasy a pagan fashioned
From Joy-of-Living through long, careless years,
An airy, lilting rondo, unimpassioned,
With never note of pain or hint of tears!
It is a creed for Youth: “Seize me and squander
The petal-tinted pleasures that I bring.
Dim twilights I have brought in which to wander
And pure delights and happy sights of Spring!’’
And for the old: “Stir into warmth the embers
Of glowing days that you must not forget!
The priceless gifts of other past Septembers,
Youth’s zest and Love’s high noon remember yet! ’’

“Pink Tape” : The ancient Sabbath Observ-
ance Act. which dates back to Stuart times
or thereabouts, has cropped up as the obstacle
iu the path of a Melbourne woman seeking
a divorce. The divorce papers, it transpired,
were delivered to her husband in N.S.W. on
a Sunday, and the letter with which
lie sent them back to his wife’s solicitors
almost reflected his complacent grin at the
legal nullity of the service. Since then dupli-
cate papers have chased the erring spouse all
over the country without finding him; and
finally the solicitors asked the Court to dis-
pense with service. But despite the hus-
band s letter showing that he had full know-
ledge that liis wife was sueing him, the Law
seems to have felt that it had to maintain
the ancient absurdity, and treat the notice
delivered on a Sunday as a thing to be
ignored; and the wife has to go to the addi-
tional expense of advertising her intention
ot seeking freedom before the suit can pro-
ceed.

Captain (now Vice-Admiral) Michael Henry
Hodges (B. 27/8/’25). As an exhibition
of skilful and daring navigation it was
unique; unaided and unobserved, the Corn-
wall made her way to the very buoy which
had been allotted to her by wireless in the
most strongly-guarded of all German harbors.
But poetically it was ill-advised, for the
Germans were so incensed that they pro-
tested vigorously to the British Government.
It may have been as a reprisal—many people
thought so—that two officers belonging to
the ship were subsequently arrested by the
Germans on a charge of espionage and in-
carcerated in a fortress. When I joined the
ship a couple of years later the canvas*
screens around the fore-top—half-way up the
foremast—were still fitted with certain in-
visible flaps. By lifting these a few inches
you could sit at ease in the top, and. com-
pletely hidden from the outside, study the
geography of foreign harbors undisturbed.
But it was for forsaking this safe refuge and
endeavoring—sketchbook in hand —to get a
“close-up” of the defences that the two offi-
cers came to grief.

“Pink Tape” : In Melbourne Divorce Court
the other day a
wife successfully
applied to have the
decree granted to
her husband over
two years ago
made absolute. The
curious feature of
the case was that
the wife had initi-
ated the suit for
divorce, whereupon
the husband tiled
a cross-petition; his
succeeded and hers
failed. Presumably
that satisfied him,
for he took no
steps to have the
decree finalised.
Instances are not
wanting of success-
ful petitioners fail-
ing to pursue their
verdict to the logi-
cal issue. Perhaps
in most of such
cases the couple
have made it up,
after using th e
court for their do-
mestic laundry-
work. But in one
N.S.W. case it was
the realisation that
her husband in-
tended to marry
again directly her
rule nisi was made
absolute that
caused an angry
woman to resolve
that it should
never be absolute
if she could help it.

Yacko” : Touching quaintly coined place-
(B. 13/8/’25). “Burra Burra’’ is gener-
ally thought to be a native word corrupted
from kookaburra. Actually it is Hindoo-
stanee for “great great”; the coolie shepherds
working on the property* on which copper
was discovered conferred the name. In the
early days of the great mine Spanish mule-
teers carried the ore from Burra to Port
Wakefield. Their favorite half-way camp is
now the township of Mintaro—Spanish for

“II.K.”: Australia has had one Chinese
bushranger—Sam Poo, who left the Mudgee
(N.S.VV.) diggings to take to the road and
emulate m a small way the deeds of his
contemporary, Thunderbolt. After shooting
a policeman and putting up a good losing
battle against three troopers and a black
tracker, he was captured and subsequently
hanged at Bathurst. Incidentally, Austra-
lia s very first ’ranger was a colored one, a
powerful Jamaican negro convict named
Csesar, who cam e in the First Fleet. As
early as 1789 he got away into the bush, hav-
ing managed to secure a soldier’s musket.
Caught after a run of a month, he was put
to work in chains on Garden Island. In
December he escaped, and terrorised the
infant settlement for another month. But
in January, 1790, when a price was placed
on his head—to go into details, it was five
gallons of rum—he was run down and shot.
* * * *
“Hasen”: A braw body from Edinburgh
was produced at the Melbourne City Court
the other day and fined for obscene language.
His ineffective plea was that “he had cer-
tainly sworn, but he had used no worse
language than was used by everyone to whom
he spoke in Australia.” I am quite able to
believe this, and still easily imagine how an
sesthetically-revolted John Hop could have
come to arrest him. Having heard what an
inoffensive Scot can do with “bright moon-
light night” and similar innocent words, I
shudder to think of the awesome sound of a
selection of good Australian cuss-words in
the mouth of an Edinburgh operator. And,
after all, it’s the sound of it that’s the dis-
tressing part about most obscenity which,
put to analysis, is usually a more or less
meaningless jumble. It was this principle
that Daniel O’Connell was said to have used
on a particularly foul-mouthed and irrepres-
sible Billingsgate fishwife, when he called
her a “parallelogram” and a “right-angled
isosceles triangle,” or words to that effect,
with an added reflection or two on her “base”
and her “hypotenuse.” That did silence the
lady. She had never heard such dirt as that
before.
* * * *
“Ex-R.N.”: The par. about the American
flagship bringing up the rear of the proces-
sion out of Port Jackson (B. 27/8/’25) re-
minds me that when Charlie Beresford was
C. in C. in the Mediterranean he arranged on
one occasion for the second flagship, the
Duncan, to lead the Fleet out of harbor. This
unusual procedure appealed to the Duncan as
an occasion to be celebrated, and as they
passed out the band struck up a then popu-
lar tune, “Fall In and Follow Me.” After
this had happened once or twice Beresford
said he was getting tired of that tune; so, as
the Duncan had just wiped the floor with
the rest of the Fleet at the annual regatta,
the tune was obligingly changed to an ex-
cerpt from “The Belle of New York”: “Of
course you can never be like us, but be as
like as you’re able to be.” After that the
flagship decided to revert to the old order and
lead the Fleet out of harbor herself.
* * * *
“Bill O’C.”: These discoverers of the un-
suspected origin of place-names occasionally
find something that isn’t there. In my youth
every old inhabitant used to tell every young
one that Thebarton, the western suburb of
Adelaide, was named after Barton Hack, an
elderly settler; and that, later, it got called
The Barton, hence “Thebarton.” Records,
however, leave it clear that Colonel Light
named the place “Theberton,” after his own
English birthplace. The a crept in as a mere
corruption. (Light’s old house still stands
there, if the suburban bungalow fiends have
not wrecked it.) Contrariwise, the northern
town, Melrose, was confidently believed to
have been named by some vague Scot-
tish family after the Caledonian abbey
town; but it was almost certainly
called after George Melrose, an early
pastoralist. Most people assume that Bal-
liannah is a native name, but when somebody
ventured on the assertion a few years ago an
amazing number of old inhabitants arose to
correct him. The favorite version was that
an old-time Scottish publican had thus per-
petuated the names of his two daughters
Belle and Hannah. (All the old boys remem-
bered the girls, and that seemed to settle it.)
Finally the widow of a long-dead lawyer re-
membered that the word was coined when the
Scot and her husband settled the plan of the
township. The former adopted his wife’s
name of Hannah, and prefixed it with the
porridge-country word “bal,” signifying a
village. A quaintly misleading name is
Olary, on the Broken Hill line. It is pro-
nounced as Hibernian, but is only a clumsy
spelling of the native “Oolarie.” Per contra
again, in Stratlialbyn there is a bridge
labelled the Golcolhoop. It isn’t a nig. word,
but commemorates three town worthies of
50 years ago, Gollan, Colman and Hooper.
* * * *
“Riwaka”: Among place names that look
as if they might be native include Tarran-
ginnie, near the Vic.-S.A. border. Old-
timers in the district account for the name
thus. An early settler ran a small flock of
sheep and sheared them himself, with a
hefty daughter for rouseabout. The old man
wag a quick but rough hand with the tongs,
and as he worked kept calling to his daughter
“Tar ’em, Jinnie.” His place came to be
known as “Tar ’em, Jinnie’s” ; corrupted to
“Tarranginnie,” it now adorns the railway
station built in the locality.
* * * *
“Huflin-Guffin”: The bitterest outburst of
scorn about local ignorance that I heard in
our village during the war was occasioned
by a person who thoughtlessly left the Union
Jack out all night. The local Sir Oracle
threatened to write to the King about it.
Will some authority tell me just why the
Union Jack must come down at sunset?

“11.E.R.” : Meet my complete philosopher
(B. 6/8/’25). Found guilty of a charge
which brought him seven days in gaol, he
remarked on hearing the sentence: “It will
serve the purpose.” Asked by the Bench
what he meant by the observation, he became
more enlightening. “Well, your Worships.”
he said, “it will give my room at the board-
ing-house a chance to get an airing.”
* * * #
“Stellsby”: I doubt whether the U.S. naval
and military prison mentioned by “Cartot”
(B. 20/5/’25) is “worse and harder” than
the naval detention barracks (they don’t
call it gaol in the R.N.) at Portsmouth. Any
matelot who has done “90 days” at Pompey
will tell you that he would rather do 12
months in a civil jug any old time. At Ports-
mouth, if a rating expostulated with his task-
master, he almost invariably qualified for a
spell in Haslad Hospital. At one period of
the war discipline at Corradino Naval Deten-
tion Barracks, Malta, became somewhat lax,
and a notorious color-sergeant of marines
was transferred from Portsmouth to tighten
things up. His first act upon arrival was
to muster the guests. /'Well, men,” he
roared, “I suppose you know who I am. I'm
the man wdio tamed lions at Pompey. I shall
now proceed to tame the Mediterranean.”
But he didn’t. There were too many R.A.N.
liard-cases at Corradino.

“Peel”: Among queer craft that have
sailed in Australian waters the 100-ton Manx
schooner Vixen deserves a line. Thirty-
seven Manxmen with the gold fever left the
Isle of Man in her on January 26, 1853, and
made Melbourne in the good time of 92 days.
After they had tried the gold diggings some

Last year’s 8 p.c. div. took £1867.
“In view of the good harvests” the co. was
tempted to make a higher bid for business.
There is possibly a reflex of the manage-
ment's experience in this comment: —
The conditions under which life assurance is
carried on in Australasia are not normal, and call
for early legislative action. A suitable bill lias been
prepared for some years and a Commonwealth Act
is promised, which, if passed, will supply a long-
felt need.
The trouble is that it is only promised.
Meantime hundreds of thousands of pounds
have been taken from investors, mostly small
men, by new cos. which make extravagant
promises of divs. that lie far in the future
where there is any possibility of return at
all. However, although this office’s new busi-
ness expanded, the gain over the previous
year was small, and expenses increased by
£1255, exclusive of the extra £567 demanded
by increased capital. (During the term
13,647 new shares were issued and called to
6s. Bd.) The revenue decrease shown is,
however, not important, for the 1924 record
included £7266 profit on sales of land. That
such a conservative insurance concern should
trade in land calls for an explanation that is
forthcoming. About eight years ago it pur-
chased 77 acres near Newcastle with the
object of establishing a garden suburb in
connection with its house-purchase policies.
Substantial profits have been reaped from
that and lesser ventures in which, by the
way, only shareholders’ capital has been
risked.
With extraordinarily fine returns being won
from wool and wheat, and prosperous con-
ditions ruling in coal and silver-lead, it is
little wonder that the Assurance and Thrift
was tempted to speed up. In the past the
co. has been content to go along at a steady
gait, keeping costs clamped down hard. It
has been guided by managing-director Dovey,
who also is an actuary, and there has been
none of that blissful ignorance of where
high costs lead a co. The result has been that
divs., though small, have been regular from
the beginning. Established primarily to do
house-purchase assurance, a branch of life
business which entitles the policy-holder,
after a specified period, to an advance to
purchase a home, the co. has branched out.
But rapidly rising values have made the co. go
very carefully; and in other lines frenzied
competition makes most business expensive.
Policy-holders rest content: the co.’s caution
has expressed itself in accumulations of
funds which have permitted of bonuses to
policy-holders following the triennial investi-
gations, notwithstanding that the future
interest-earning capacity of funds is assumed
to be only 3J p.c.—the low level upon which
the greatest offices base their calculations.
Last year’s income of £27,495 consisted of
premiums, £18,957; interest, etc., £7845; and
profit on investments, £693. Expenses,
although lighter than those of most young
cos., last year amounted to 29.2 p.c. (ex-
cluding divs.).
Besides ordinary life and house-purchase
the co. does some fire and accident writing.
This branch shows steady but slow develop-
ment. Net fire premiums gave £3072 and acci-
dent and sickness £732, while £lB3 of interest
was earned. Claims were .very favorable at
£254 fire and £248 accident and sickness,
claims and expenses together taking only 59
p.c. of income. Total funds moved from
£1641 to £4109. In addition to life and
general branch funds there are reserves of
£7136. Liabilities on March 31 aggregated
£6692. Assets consisted of: Mortgages,
£55,764 ; freeholds, £34,943 ; loans, £35,356 ;
shares in public cos., £15,992; cash, Gov-
ernment securities, etc., £7294; various,
£3343. Those assets are not all of the highest
kind, but it may be taken for granted that
the investments have been selected with
great care.

A conservative policy in the matter of divs.,
allied to keen control, must sooner or later —
and generally sooner than later —operate for
the benefit of shareholders. This, however,
didn’t dispel the cloud that settled on the
market when the directors of Tooliey’s failed
to increase the div. rate to 10 p.c. Those
who had bought to sell because they thought
the point would be sprung are making a
bit of a noise; and some support comes, of
course, from thirsty shareholders who say
they’ll be a long time dead and big divs.
won’t help them then. An extra 1 p.c. for
the year would have called for £0276, and
certainly that wouldn’t have interfered much
with the amount sent to reserves. Even full
capital of £1,000,000 (£4OO was unpaid on
July 81) would call for £20,132 less than the
net profits for the last 12 months ; and visible
reserves have already been so built up that
total average funds for the current year will
have to earn only 6s p.c. to pay 10 p.c. How-
ever, while it is dear the 10 p.c. would have
been easy, the Wild Cat has no scratches
for a policy which leads to strength. No
brewery co. wants to be caught with an
empty arsenal: for there is no telling when it
may have to fight for its life.
Last year’s disclosed profit in proportion
to funds was a shade under the average of
the four preceding terms: —

Profits of the introductory table do not in-
clude those recently uniform sums of £15,0*00
placed aside for depreciation of plant and
machinery. But, inasmuch as the directors
regularly report that all expenditure in con-
nection with the maintenance of plant and
machinery in a high state of efficiency has
been charged against revenue, it is highly
probable that the amount is unnecessary;
which means that the true position each year
has been so much better than the figures
allege. Balance-sheet movements show rapid\
expansion

The influence of the new capital is visible in
those figures. During the year the goodwill
item (£22,500) was written off. As it was
not counted an asset in the introductory
table the movement is not shown. The re-
port says the course was taken because the
figure did not adequately represent its pre-
sent value. Certainly! And, in any case,
goodwill is wrapped up in most fixed assets
in the brewery business, for, denied the right
to brew beer, a lot of the machinery has
merely scrap value. Still, the next cold-
water wave seems a long way out, and as
a brewery scrip Toohey’s is nowadays again
popular. An increase in the div. rate cannot
much longer be withheld.

A fat profit was to be expected with phe-
nomenal prosperity in the sugar and wool
districts around and at the back of Rock-
hampton, and clip and crop prospects for
the current year are good too. Reid’s is an
advt. for decentralisation. For a quarter-
million trading co. to have its headquarters
in one of the lesser cities of a State is evi-
dence that it is supplying the needs of a big
area. The convergence of Queensland’s
central railway system on Rockhampton has
made this possible. Of the 12J p.c. to share-
holders, 2i p.c. was paid as bonus out of
tax-free war loan interest. But the co. could
maintain that rate without difficulty, for
86 p.c. of last year’s profit was passed to
reserves. The 12i p.c. is worth more than
twice as much to old holders : of the quarter-
million of paid capital £145,000 represents
gift issues made between 1910 and 1918. Last
year’s div. and bonus are equal to little more
than 7 p.c. on total funds. Reserves now
amount to 75 p.c. of capital; and there is
an insurance fund of £18,630 which is not
included in the figures in the introductory
table. A comparison of balance-sheet figures
back to 1910 shows how the co. has ex-
panded :

A conservative hand needs to wield the pencil
these days when the stocks exceed paid capital.
But the fact that the co. emerged through the
post-war slump without visible ill-effects—
on the contrary. 10 p.c. divs. were paid and
£28,578 was added to reserves in 1921 and
1922 —is an indication that it acted care-
fully in those troublous times. On
May 31, £97,141 was owing on open
account. It was well secured by
cash, book debts and stock amounting to
£431,220. Further, of the entry “Pro-
perties, A.U.S.N. Co., Ltd., shares, war
loan, etc., £142,718,” it is likely that
the greater part was gilt-edged stock:
shareholders were informed in 1919 that the
amount of Commonwealth stock then held
was £102,000. A warehouse is to be erected
in Sydney and War Loan maturing in Dec.
next'is to be used to defray the cost. Should
Mount Morgan mine be closed down it would
affect Reid and Co., although the 10 months’
stoppage in 1921-22 did not materially re-
duce profits. So well entrenched is the co.
that, given a continuance of past efficient
management, it is in a position to stand nor-
mal setbacks without much trouble.

And there is no reason to suspect that the
limit has been reached. On the contrary,
the co. prepares for further growth. Thus
the amount lately written off premises is to
compensate for the buildings demolished to
permit of additions now being made to the
co.’s present offices. Shareholders are in a
capital position: on June 30 there were no
liabilities; assets consisted of public securi-
ties. £21,842 ; cash, etc., £lBO6 ; premises and
fittings, £41,203. Clients and future clients
are protected against the consequences of
negligence or worse by capital and reserves
of £57,183; and there is £151,500 additional
security in uncalled capital.

Easily the best ever, but in no way surpris-
ing in view of the extraordinary opening
series of wool sales. The big part the record
prices played in producing the record earn-
ings is illustrated by these details of the
co.’s sales in stock and wool: —

There was a carry-over of wool, but the
report is silent as to its dimensions. Cattle
sales notched a record, but the number ot
sheep handled was the smallest since 1918.
The latter was a general experience; only
1,800,000-odd sheep were yarded at Home-
bush during the 12 months. But the short-
age there was more than compensated by a
general increase in sales of store stock, pro-
perties and machinery.
When the co. was formed in 1910 goodwill
w-as included at £41.988, offset by about
£lO,OOO of reserves taken over from the old
eo. Although the amount was long since
swamped by accumulated profits, it was only
after latest appropriations that the reserve
for goodwill balanced the intangible. Clear
above the sum are the amounts in general
and equalisation reserves totalling £117,665.
There has been a praiseworthy consideration
of reserves from the first term, and on. two
occasions more was laid by than was distri-
buted. Shareholders were content with 6
and 7 p.c., the first 8 p.c. div. not forth-
coming until 1922, Last year shareholders
for the first time received 10 p.c. That rate
will now call for £31,613 p.a.—capital was in-
creased from £236,814 during the year.. On
a smaller capital earnings have been sufficient
to pay it, and 10 p.c. will probably now be
a minimum, provided, of course, the co.’s
business doesn’t slip from it.
Balance-sheet figures as at .Tune 30 show
how the finances had been influenced by the
necessitv of supporting growers whose wool
had been held over. That position has im-
proved, of course, since the resumption of
sales in July. Still, the necessity for the
increased capital is made very evident by the
increased dependence on outsiders ;

To finance its clients the co. had to go to
its bankers for an additional £141,684, over-
draft having risen to £280,925. Other lia-
bilities, although heavy at £320,927, were
almost £6OOO less than they were a year ago.
The completion of the additions to the Syd-
ney office was responsible for the increase
of £42,028 in freeholds. Advances, needless
to say, showed a big expansion: they reached
a point at which they were two and a half
times greater than the capital. The future
for wool seems secure enough, but Australia
has escaped even an ordinary drought for a
number of years, and it would be absurd to
ignore the certainty of trouble from that
cause sooner or later. In addition to visible
reserves provision has been made for contin-
gencies. But what in good times may be
considered excess allowance, in bad times
might prove insufficient. In the case of
pastoral finance cos. much depends on the
judgment with which this risk is measured.

supply, special plant had to be designed, and a start
was not made until October. The delay had not
been anticipated. Another circumstance which re-
duced earnings was the cancellation of the second
contract for concrete pipes. A number of pipes failed
to pass the test and Singapore Council cancelled the
contract. Failure was due to bad cement, but as
the cement passed the standard at time of shipment,
the co. has no redress.
Excellent prospects are again reported: —
Prior to the close of the financial year two con-
tracts were received from the F.M.S. Railways for
culvert pipes to the value of £lO,OOO, and further
contracts are expected. Value of the balance of
work on the Gunong Pulai contract is £16,758.
Since the close of the accounts, the Singapore Muni-
cipality annual supply contract (approximately
£23,000) has been received.
The Board is considering the advisableness
of calling up the final ss. on the 40,000 £1

Last year the South Kalgurli Board
(W.A.) celebrated a Government rebate on
freights and water by annexing an _ extra
£lOOO in fees. This year in expectation ot
a gold bonus a shareholders’ meeting voted, as
from April, 1924, 5 p.c. of the co. s net pro-
fits after 10 per cent:., or two-fiftlis of the
present rate of dividend, has been paid. A
substantial tonnage has been added to the
mine’s reserves during the year, and the out-
look is considered bright enough to deepen
the shaft. The only other co. on the Kal-
goorlie field that has been game enough to
do this in recent years is the Lake View and
Star.
* * * *
Royal Commissioner Kingsley Thomas’s
recommendation to amalgamate the Kal-
goorlie cos. into one or two groups was
Avarmly supported by chairman Cordner
James at the Oroya Links meeting. James
said that the Board had put out feelers Avith
that object in view, but so far had met with
little success. He believed, however, that
the controllers of the mines concerned would
ultimately come round to Thomas’s Avay of
thinking. Some shareholders thought that as
the co. Avas being run at a loss it ought to
liquidate or alternatively abandon mining
and become an investment concern. Janies
said the Board wanted to carry on a little
longer to see (1) if the flotation method of
treatment proved successful, and (2) what
some important prospecting now proceeding
in the old Kalgurli lease revealed. If re-
sults were unsatisfactory the* directors
avouM be prepared to either liquidate or try
something else.
* * * *
Bigger tonnages, improved returns and
larger profits were predicted by chairman
(Jollier at the Lake View and Star meeting.
Director Cordner James, Avho followed, de-
clared that all going Avell this year’s net
surplus would be at least £25,000, or more
than double last year’s. Shareholders Avere
so overjoyed to hear this that they voted
the directors an extra £lOO a year apiece, and
did without a dividend themselves. Includ-
ing the Ivanhoq, the co. now has four mines
at Kalgoorlie, whose aggregate ore reserves
are estimated at 817,383 tons averaging
31s. 6d. per ton.
* * * tt
Freney Oil Co. (W.A.) is whooping over
the £22,500 subsidy which the Federal Gov-
ernment is giving to bore at Price’s Creek
and elsewhere. Chairman Nicholson says this
grant has exceeded the Board’s expectations,
and will enable boring to be speedily done,
which, without a subsidy, might have taken
years or perhaps might never have been done
through Avan t of funds. Nicholson claims
that Dr. Wade was greatly assisted in form-
ing an opinion of the prospects of the co.’s
property by reports and plans supplied by
its geological experts. To date the co. has
reported “seepages,” “anticlines” “globules
of oil,” etc., in abundance. It now has a
chance of really doing something.
* * * #
Westralia has grown cold on alleged oil
areas in the south and south-east. Several
Avere reckoned to have infallible indications,
although described as duds by Government
officers. Finally the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment was induced to send Dr. Wade
along, and his remark, “The longer I remain
the more I wonder Avhy I Avas sent here,”
indicated his opinion.
* * * *
Development Avork on Mt. Isa field is more
than satisfying W. H. Corbould. The Rio
Grande in the sulphide zone is as good as
anything on the field for values, and No. 4
shaft at 200 ft. has proved ore 6ft. to 7ft. thick
averaging approximately 30 p.c. lead, 240 z.
silver and 7 p.c. zinc of a gross value of
about £l4 a ton, and there are unascertained
values on both sides of the shaft. On the
Black Rock lode, taking in the high-grade
carbonate on the hanging wall in No. 31
shaft, the latest news is that, approaching
the sulphide ore, about 6ft. of it will almost
touch 50 p.c. lead and 20oz. silver. The Mt.
Isa lode, which among the big guns
has been one of the poorest except for several
payable ore bands, has similarly improved on
sinking and is stated to be showing 16ft. of
ore worth £6 10s. a ton at the 300 ft. level.
Everything points to the fact that much of
the shallower ground, with the exception, per-
haps, of the Grande, Crystal and Black Rock,
has been a zone of comparative impoverish-
ment. Prop.’s No. 1 bore has already shoAvn
the solid values in the sulphides of the Ibus-
Star lode between 200 ft. and 400 ft., and the
No. 2 bore promises to be equally as good.
R. E. Allan for the Lander Oil Co. has suc-
cessfully fished out the drill stem and bits in
the Orallo (Q.) bore and signalled all clear
down to 2615 ft. Showings of gas and oil
have been rather striking the past Aveek. The
casing has been set and operations to test
the sands are now in progress. Geologist
L. C. Ball is at Orallo to Avatcli operations
on behalf of the Mines Department and
secure samples for testing. Good or bad
tidings may be flashed over the wires any
day now.
* * # *
The Gympie Syndicate which is developing
the Lucknow mine on that field Avith Govern-
ment subsidies lately struck a reef up to 18
inches thick around the 78ft. level. At latest
it was reported to have pinched to a few
inches but was carrying good silver values.
A sample sent to the Mines Department
assayed 3dAVt. gold and 940 z. silver, gross
value £l3 a ton. The syndicate is driving
on the reef looking for its intersection with
the black slates or plumbago floors which
invariably bring in the gold and without
which Gympie reefs are practically barren.
A good deal of prospecting work has been
done without attaining this desirable con-
junction. Chief Geologist B. Dunstan is
assisting in the search, and will shortly make
another inspection.
* * * *
Dr. Wade’s report to the Commonwealth
Government on oil prospects in Queensland
is practically a re-statement of the opinions
of the State geologists. His view of prospects
at Tewantin agrees with that of L. C. Ball,
and he characterises boring there as the rank-
est wild-catting. Tie gives Beaudesert no
chance for payable supplies, an opinion ex-
pressed some time ago by C. C. Morton. As
to the Overflow anticline Avest of Beaudesert,
he agrees Avitli J. H. Reid, who reported two
years ago against boring on it, despite its
favorable structure, on account of the mas-
sive sandstones, lack of organic remains in
the strata and the high carbon ratios of the
coals in the neighborhood. He estimates
the chances in the artesian basin generally
between Roma and Longreaclx as about 30 in
100, and strongly recommends detailed geo-
logical work to determine favorable struc-
tural areas for boring. Both W. E. Cameron
and L. C. Ball have expressed optimistic views
as to the probability of commercial supplies
of oil and gas in different parts of this basin.
Minister for Mines Jones is concerned that
the Prime Minister has only offered Queens-
land £5OOO for geological survey work.
Wade’s report shows that he does not con-
sider its chances less than those of W.A. and
N. S. Wales, but thinks that preliminary
expenditure is more necessary there before
boring is undertaken. This is really be-
cause the geological structure beneath the
western plains is almost entirely unknown,
owing to the poor exposures of strata. As
a matter of fact, no other State has pro-
duced oil in the quantity obtained from Long-
reach bore recently, nor wet gas in the quan-
tity obtained from the Roma bores some
years ago.

Alligator River Gold Syndicate has been
reformed by Arthur Clarke, of Cairns, into
the Northern Territory Mining Co., with a
capital of £50,000 in 5000 shares of £lO each.
Syndicate-holders receive one paid-up share
for eA 7 ery contributing share they take up;
2500 shares are held in reserve. Walter
Colley, who Avas sent to the N.T. to inspect,
reported adversely on the original proper-
ties, but secured an option over the Marran-
boy tin-mine, and the co. also took up the
Eureka gold-mine. Work has commenced
on the Marranboy, and the workings, which
were down to 90ft., with ore in the bottom,
are being sunk a further 100 feet, and will
be driven and cross-cut to prove the values
at depth. Up to date 6000 tons of ore re-
turning 3 p,c. have been extracted from the
open cut.
* •* * *
The Billy Hughes Co., Normanby (N.Q.),
has purchased a winding plant for the Resur-
gam mine. As soon as it is installed, the
main shaft, which is straight for 20 feet and
underlay for 60 feet, will be turned into an
underlay shaft, and sinking will be resumed
on the sulphides at 85 feet, where ore has
been located assaying soz. gold.
Palmer River Gold Co. has scout-bored
150 acres of its Fernhill Gleeroy area, re-
sulting in an average of slightly over Is.
per cub. yard. Walter Baker is in charge.
The boring plant has been removed 50 miles
lower down the river, to Strathleven. This
area is considered suitable for bucket-
dredging, and will be systematically sampled
while the dry weather holds.
* * * *
Mount Patterson,. Attunga (N.S.W.), has
been impeded by scai’city of suitable labor.
Managing-director P. S. Graham advises
shareholders thht four dams have been com-
pleted, and a fifth is well under way, also
that “water has been discovered in one place
practically inside the battery, and in (another
place a few yards outside, so that a good
supply is assured.” The “mine itself wall
be ready for working as soon as another
open cut has been completed, as there is a
large quantity of material ready for removal
to the battery.” Erection of the 20-head
from the old Mt. Dudley is said to be Avell
advanced, so Patterson shareholders should
not be kept in suspense much longer.
Good luck might be included as an asset
by the South Lucknow (N.'S.W 1 .). Geo-
logist Harper’s intention in 1920 to prospect
from the old Wild Cat shaft was frustrated
by a temporary loss of the ground. Com-
pelled to sink the first shaft much further
s.-w., a lucky discovery of pyrites at the
65ft. level in 1922 sent the co. down the
Avays. A few months later a shaft was sunk
to 125 ft., into and through the best vein and
shoot of pyrites found in the mine. Forsak-
ing a discovery in order to find it again with
a new shaft is usually a Lucknow deathblow.
Just when heavy scrip forfeitures seemed to
mark the end of things, Duncan’s lucky
200 ft. level crosscut at the close of 1923
struck pyrites. Two years exhausted pati-
ence again, and the last call of lid. suav
about 80,000 of 200,000 contribs refusing
to pay. Now in the saddle as managing
director, Duncan has struck some more
pyrites, the best of which assayed up to
15oz. Holders of forfeitures, still redeem-
able, thought a second time, and paid. Again
luck was in.
* * * *
Working in historic ground at Maldon
(Vic.), Carlisle and Whittaker's have had
in-and-out luck at 200 ft. At 9Sft. from the
shaft the reef was faulted 4Sft. east. Then
good stone Avas found, only to be affected
by a second break. Slate has been gone
through, and a small reef inspired hope that
a fresh shoot was on the horizon. Now the
level carries a full body of stone with a
few prospects of gold. What the co. wants
is a feAV of the old-fashioned droppers which
enriched the formations Avhen Maldon
counted as a goldfield instead of a mining
cemetery. Still the breaks aren't a bad
sign, as South German made good under one
at about 600 ft., but lost its reputation when
another slioAved up at 1700 ft.
* * * ■if
Little Ajax stands easily first among
Daylesford (Vic.) mines,for on calls of £13,100
it has furnished £475,000 of gold and paid
£149,500 in divs. That is the best of the
Cabbage Garden. It mayn’t be big, but
if the plot is rich the fruit is golden. Of
late, Ajax has been trembling on the lOdwt.
mark, which nowadays is barely high
enough to find divs. To see if any gold
has been left in the upper levels after 13
years’ solid delving, the flat make at No. 4
is having attention, but it is a somewhat
forlorn hope. Prospects are a shade better
at No. 5, but generally there isn’t much to
boast about there or anyAyliere else in the
mine at the moment save the extent of “the
lode mixture.”

RaAvang (F.M.S.) made £16,093 net at
March 31, 281 tons tin-oxide being recovered
for the year from 768,000 yards treated. Re-
coveries work out at .811 b. against .661 b.
for the previous term. Costs also mounted,
being 7.47 d. against 6.17 d. The report states
that “Government taxation on tin won
amounted to 43 p.c. of the net profit.” The
12in. steam sluicing plant has been thrown
out of commission, and the co. will persevere
with the 14in. electric plant and the new
bucket dredge. There is £16,014 at credit
of p. and 1. A capital of £240,000 will take
some feeding when the div. stage eventually
is reached. And the 240 z. ground of the
prospectus of 1920 is as elusive as ever.

When Nai Hoot Juita got a suction cutter
dredge for £26,000 delivered on the wharf,
everything seemed bright. But the hoped-for
hasn’t happened; the concentrating appli-
ances do not save the tin expected. A heart-
to-heart talk between the who
built the plant, and the Board ends in the
firm agreeing to let the co. have the plant
for the £15,000 already paid plus £2500,
of which £l5OO is to come out of tin won.
What isn’t told is whether the co. thinks
it can get the plant ship-shape. After all,
that is the point. Machinery isn’t cheap at
any price if the tin gets doAvn the sluice-box.
•* * * *
Alluvial Tin (F.M.S.) policy is to become
a second Austral Malay—a holding and pro-
moting concern in a handful of shares at the
beginning. Hitherto its growth as a market
counter savors of the hothouse, as its second
balance-sheet arrives concurrently with a
£lO market quotation for the 20s. shares, of
which there are 20,000. Not one of its
litter, however, has yet become a producer.
The profit for the year to March 31
was £120,624. The co. sold £170,583 worth
of mining lauds, the purchase and prospect-
ing of which cost £44,317; but payments for
these areas were received, not in sterling
but in wads of scrip in new tin floats. The
co.’s future depends upon the success
of Malim Nawar, Settlements Co., Maliin
Nawar South, Kundang, Kuala Kampar,
Tanjong Tualang, and other possible adven-
tures. Most of these are contained in a
swamp jungle area four miles by four on the
Kampar and Kinta rivers, containing about
5000 acres, and in which two further floats
are forecasted. The co. had £15,308 of
liquid assets at March 31, and creditors
claimed £9799, of wdiich £6OOO is entered as
fully-paid shares due as staff commission.
With £lO.OOB brought in, the credit balance
at p. and 1. is given as £130,633, of which
£117,000 was acquired during the term by
share interests of £15,750 in Kundang Co.,
£30,000 each in Maliin Nawar South, Kuala
Kampar and Tanjong Tualang, and £11,250
in Tanah Biji. All these holdings are at
heavy premiums in the share markets, but
trade in them has been light. If the boring
charts are corroborated by the dredges right
through the co. will become affluent.

Banjoemas (Java) Oil Concessions, Ltd.,
has issued a prospectus inviting subscrip-
tions for 600 shares at £lO. Vendors take
£lOOO _in shares and £2OOO in cash for ex-
ploration rights over 184 sq. miles of which
they can finally take only 1250 acres. Further
prospecting is to cost £3300. So far only
samples have been taken from seepages. No
reference is made to the title of any area
that may be selected up to 1250 acres. The
law of the Dutch East Indies is that no
foreigner can hold land titles unless he is
naturalised, and any company holding oil or
any other areas must be registered according
to the laws of the Dutch East Indies, and
include a certain number of Dutchmen. The
Royal Dutch Shell Co., an Anglo-Dutch-
German organisation, had its genesis in the
Netherland Indies, and can get concessions
and work oilfields, while new companies are
regarded with suspicion generally.

Red nuisauices have suggested that A. G.
Canning was named chairman of the De-
portation Board because of his Nationalist
sympathies. As a matter of fact, Canning
was a member of a firm (R. S. Haynes and
Co.) which got most of the Labor party’s
legal business in Perth, and received iiis
appointment as Perth Local Court magis-
trate—-the job lue left to become a member
of. the Federal Taxation Appeal Board —
from a Labor Government. His father was
h member of tlse Westralian Assembly in its
parly years, bust the son has never tackled
politics. A short, well-nourished man with
the round, smooth type of face that looks

came in, and the firm still flourishes and
occasionally sends this paper a bill. Manly
was hardly a village when Charles Laurence
first went to live in it: he was one of the
founders of the co-operative co. which was
afterwards absorbed by the Port Jackson
Co., and he helped to set up a municipality
there In his earlier days he made a hobby
of soldiering; in his profession he strove, no
matter which side he was on, to avoid litiga-
tion ; and no kinder-hearted man ever held
out a hand for six-and-eightpence.
Though Watt has made up his mind to
let somebody else have the Speaker’s chair,
he isn't likely to stay contentedly a mere
private member of the House of Reps. It
might suit Bruce to take the High Comniis-
sionership aiul then, like George Reid, induce
some British constituency to provide him
with a. seat in the Commons. His spats, his
war service, his Rt. Hon. handle and his
Australian Parliamentary experience, not to
mention his comparative youth and English
manner, might all prove recommendations.

“BILL” PLAIN,

to the Federal
Upper House to fill
the vacancy caused
by the death of
Senator Russell.
About the last of the men who co-operated
with the great J. A. Hartley in setting up
the State system of education in South Aus.
died last month. Fifty-odd years ago, when
the system was introduced, Lionel Stanton
was running a private school in Clare: lie
was “taken over,” and was one of three
whom Hartley presently chose as his
first inspectors. Later he succeeded
his chief, and, when still newer methods
were called for in the schools, was
made secretary to the Minister. When he
retired from that job he pottered about his
garden till he was 82. Lionel was a brother
of those Misses Stanton who for countless
years conducted a “school for young ladies”
on the primmest old-English lines —they
even had an archery class at one time. One
of them almost horrified the sisterhood by
marrying: her choice of a husband was C. C.
Kingston’s erratic brother Pat.
Scotch College in Melbourne is amongst
the mourners for banker James D. Law;
lie was No. 1 boy on its roll. Born S 2 years
ago in Jamaica, he was brought to Australia
when he was 11. and four years later joined
Hie old Bank of Victoria. Thirty-six years
afterwards he was its general manager. He
was the last survivor of the g.m.’s who had
to deal with the big bank crisis in 1893.
Fred Doran, manager for 17 years of the
Manly (Sydney) Ferry Co., has gone to
navigate a higher port. Born at Cockatoo
Island 62 years ago, where his father was
a dock engineer, he became one of the most
expert yachtsmen on the harbor. In the
days of the 22- and 24-foot classes he
achieved renown in skippering the late Sam
Hordern’s Plover, and last year sailed Lord
Forster’s Corella to Queensland for the inter-
state contests.
Recollections of the time when the David
Jones block in George-street, Sydney, was
known as “Jerusalem Warehouse” are re-
vived by the death of the wealthy Mrs.
Elizabeth Wangenheim, whose father, James
Simmons, was a great importer, using ships
of his own to bring in his merchandise. For
a mere £lOO he originally acquired the entire
block bounded by George, Barrack, York and
King streets, but sold all but the George and
Barrack streets corner. His wife, who was
born on The Rocks, lived to the age of
98; the lady just dead was 90. She was
married in 1855 to Gus Wangenheim, then
host of the Post Office Hotel, standing in
York-street, where now is Gardiner and Co.'s
warehouse. Later he had the Cafe de Paris
in King-street. Quong Tart afterwards
secured the place, and it was in his time
Sydney’s fashionable teashop. It is now
Albert's music warehouse.
George William Forbes, Maoriland s new
Leader of the Opposition, in succession to T.
M. Wilford, is native-born, and owns to 67
summers. lie entered the House 17 years
ago as a Liberal champion of the small
cockie —he was himself one of the original
crown settlers on the Cheviot estate, acquired
under John McKenzie’s Land Settlement
Act. Hard-headed and straightforward, lie
will add no pyrotechnics to politics, and will
be none the worse for that.
On the day that Minister Peacock intro-
duced the Teachers’ Superannuation Bill to
Vic. Parliament, John Braithwaite, leading
head teacher, retired at 65 from the service.
As president of the union and leading organ-
iser of the movement to establish a retiring
fund, Braithwaite put in many years of
self-denying work. He had no axe to grind,
being a pension man, but solidly toiled for
the younger fry, who in many cases were
either too lazy or too indifferent to look after
their own interests.
The distracted Defence Department is
losing brilliant Brigadier-General H. W.
Lloyd now: lie is joining the Vacuum Oil
Co. Lloyd, who carries most of the alphabet
after his name, is only 42; and for that
reason, and because he is a singularly good
instructor, his loss is particularly serious.
The attraction is a screw that he couldn’t
hope to get for another 20 years in the De-
partment. He went away as adjutant with
the Ist Division A.I F. Artillery in 1914,
and held several high commands during the
war.
Mrs. Mary Rogers (Labor), Vic.'s only
skirted municipal councillor up till Thurs-
day last, was defeated on that day, when
she sought re-election for the Central Ward
of Richmond. To console the sex the rate-
payers of the Mountain Riding of Gisborne
Shire who took the trouble to vote returned
Mrs. Blanche Ross-Watt. There has been
no rush of feminine candidates since they
were made eligible for municipal councils 11
years ago. There have been general and by-
elections for the two State Houses since
the barriers to nomination of petticoated
citizens were swept away there two or three
years ago, but not one has tried her luck
for a constituency. And in 24 years none
of her has managed to capture a Common-
wealth seat.
Died last week, in Melbourne, Louisa Bren-
tan i, , whose father kept the jeweller’s shop
in Collins-street, Melbourne, where the first
nuggets of gold discovered in Victoria were
exhibited. Some of the nuggets found by
liayley at Coolgardie were shown in the
same place four decades later. It was near
where the Equitable Building stands to-day.
Sculptor Bertram Mackennal, the first
Australian associate of the Royal Academy,
is coming back to Australia next January.
Sydney’s project of a huge sailors’ memorial
in the harbor and Melbourne’s, notion of
indulging in more statuary in public places
may be the inducement for his return apart
from a desire to see his native land ; but the
£5OO set apart by the Melbourne City Coun-
cil as a nucleus for the fund that public-
spirited citizens were expected to support
but haven’t lias gone on a fine bit of work
by Paul Montford, and the Sydney project
is quite nebulous.
Last week had no luck for David Andrew,
of Bendigo (Vic.). On Tuesday he was re-
jected for the. Senate, and on Thursday he
failed to regain the municipal seat at Ben-
digo he had held for 20 years.
Last week saw the passing of Mrs. Edward
Hill, one of the two centenarians in Australia
actually born in the country. Her birth-
place was Emu Plains (N.S.W.), but for
years she lived in an old cottage next to
where the Australian Club in Bent-street.
Sydney, now stands. She was a bright old
lady even when she was 103, and could still
recall vividly the bush which grew where
reinforced concrete grows to-day.
George Smith, member of N. S. Wales
A.L.P. executive, ex-carpenter and secretary
of ■ the Labor Daily, is to be given another
run against ex-Speaker Johnson for the Lang
Federal seat. Taking up the running as a
stopgap candidate on the last occasion, he
created a surprise by getting within a tholi-
st and votes of victory. He is rotund, spec-
tacled, dressy and comfortable-looking;
phlegmatic and humorless, he limits his
speeches to the “industrial” side.
A movement is on foot to honor the mem-
ory of dead members of the Sydney Techni-
cal College teaching staff by providing
scholarships in their names. Miss M. E.
Roberts, for many years in charge of
Women’s Handicrafts, and Miss A. M.
Munro, Lecturer-in-Charge of Domestic
Science, both of whom passed on last year,
have been marked for recognition ; also John
L. Bruce, father of sanitation in the Ma
State; E. E. Wadsworth, his all-too-short-
lived successor; and Henry Lord, Lecturer
in Agriculture. A course of lectures en-
titled “Some Early Civilisations” is to be
delivered by principal G. W. Thatcher in
the Turner Hall, Central Technical College,
during September in connection with the
movement.
C. E. Bright, who will be the last to hold
the title of D.P.M.G. in Vic.—the next poten-
tate will sign himself Deputy-Director of
Posts and Telegraphs—is retiring after 49
years of good service. He joined the Queens-
land Post Office as a lad, was soon post-
master at Normanton, and so became a well-
known figure in the Gulf country. After
being postmaster at Warwick and D.P.M.G.
at Brisbane, he came to Melbourne in 1907.
A hearty, genial sportsman, he has hosts of
friends -who will be glad to know that in
retirement he will still be able to throw his
leg across a good horse at his farm near
I rankston—called Carbrook after an ances-
tral home in Yorkshire—where he will try
his hand at breeding Shetland ponies.
George Gammon, just dead at Hawthorn
(Vic.), aged 96, was Victoria’s oldest J.P.
Drawn his last set of plans, Robert Gould,
of Longford (Tas.). He was the son of
the George Gould who settled in Longford
over a hundred years ago, and he started
work with his father as a monumental mason
A hoisting apparatus falling on his head
injured his eyesight, and while shut up in
a darkened room he planned a water supply
for his native town. Since then he had been
the engineer and planner of water services
for nearly every country town in the Speck.
“B.B.” : George Smith, who was jolly-good-
fellowed the other day by the birds of Parra-
matta Gaol (B. 27/8/’25), is a new type of
governor. He has his own ideas about hand-
ling sinners. Talking a prisoner into ‘•lie
path _ of righteousness instead of punishing
him into it and having a friendly little bout
with the gloves occasionally are two of them.
The experiments have been highly successful.
Hence the junketing on the occasion of
Smith’s removal to Bathurst.
The master of the Oonah had a practical
sailor as his legal representative when the
Marine Court inquired into the Oonah-Cooma
collision. His advocate, Evans, has the right
to call himself captain, and was at sea for
a long time before he decided that a better
living was to be picked up on the ocean of
Costs. During the war he commanded the
Tahiti, then a trooper; and before that he
was in charge of the Koonya when it towed
Shackleton’s Nimrod to the Antarctic seas.
Mrs. Ellen Axtill, a vigorous old lady who
has just reached 91, may be the world’s
oldest tripper if she makes the voyage to
England she contemplates next year to dis-
pose of some property that has been left her.
As she has a son of 73, there is no doubt
about her age. She came to Victoria when
11, aud at 17 married a successful digger
who found a nugget weighing 2741 b and made
over a thousand pounds exhibiting it before
it was sold.
R. E. O'HALLORAN, secretary to the N. S.
Wales Parliamentary Labor party.
.Justice Owen, of Sydney, the 63-year-old
son of a Judge, has married a lady who is the
daughter and grand-daughter of distinguished
Judges. The bride’s father, F. R- Chap-
man, was appointed to the Supreme Court
Bench in Maoriland in 1903, and the grand-
father, Henry Samuel Chapman, after a
varied career, ended upon the Supreme Court
bench of the same country in 1881. He was
a very remakable man. Among the many
interesting things he did was to start (1833)
the first daily paper in Canada, the Montreal
Advertiser. In Maoriland he launched the
N.Z. Journal (1840) ; three years later he
was on the Bench; nine years later he re-
tired and went back to England, but was
drawn south again by the Victorian gold
finds. He was soon in politics, and as Attor-
ney-General prosecuted the convicts who at-
tacked and murdered their inspector-general.
John Price, father of Colonel Tom, well
known to a later generation of soldiers and
strikers. In his later years he returned to
the M.L. Bench, and lived and died at
Dunedin.
THE KID.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1\ lien toil is over add night comes down,
I like to get ’ome to the kid;
I’ve lost all me love, for the joys of the town—
Who don’t with a missus and kid?
’E’s waitin’ around (by the gate when I come,
And ’e blows ’is tin (trumpet, and bangs on ’is drum.
Oh, a chap ’asn’t time to feel tired or glum,
When ’e’s grabbed by a curly-’aired kid!
The poor little misjsus ’as ’im all day.
She says she is rendy to drop ;
Wherever ’e went ’e was right in the way;
Whatever ’e did, It was “Stop!”
’E got into mischief), as decent kids will.
Invaded the pantry Uml swallowed ’is fill
Of strawberry tart—» -nearly made ’imself ill;
An’ she threatened to give him Dad’s strop.
The missus ’as gone to the pictures to-night,
She wanted a breath of fresh air.
All ready for bed, ’e croons with delight,
And fondles ’is bijg Teddy-bear.
I tell ’im the story of Jack and the bean,
Of the impudent tom-cat who looked at a queen,
And tales of fierce pirates in purple and green,
Who sprang with a roar from their lair.
Now, after vain efforts I’ve got ’im to sleep ;
’E’s ’ard to make do as ’e’s bid ;
The missus returns, and she takes a sly peep,
While softly removin’ ’er lid.
The joy and the sparkle is back in ’er eyes,
And flushed is ’er cheeks as the dawn in the skies.
With ’er ’ead on me shoulder she tenderly sighs
“It’s nice to get ’ome to the kid,”
S.A.

Mf- J- S. Crapp, Woodstock, Armidale, N.S.W., writes,
12th November, 1924: —“Re Calcium Cyanide for rabbit
destruction. I consider it absolutely the best means of
rabbit destruction ever put on the market, provided it is
used the right way.”
, Mr. A. Lawrence, Walwa, Victoria, writes, 26th July,
19^o: — I promised to let you know' about Calcium Cyanide.
1 can say it is all right, arid is the best-known method
of destroying rabbits. It is only a matter
of time, when all graziers will use it.”
For the application of CALCIUM
CYANIDE the Fumo Dust lower is recom-
mended. Easy, safe and convenient to
use.
Mr. Atchison Grieve, Fellwood, Avenue

with the work done.”

SALESMAN : “That’s a beautiful ’bus now, and only run a few
miles Of course, there may be some little thing she wants,
but that's to be expected.”
CUSTOMER: “I'll tell you what. I’ll buy the little thing she wants
and you throw tn the car.”
Jim Carew”: What about this as a record
accident? An Upper Hawkesbury River orchardist
was gathering quinces from a tree that grew on the
margin of the bank. In doing so he slipped and
fell into the water. The fall dislodged a colonv
of hornets’ nests, built under the bank, and the
dislodged tenants at once attacked him. When at
last clear of them he registered 87 stings. An
agonising fortnight in bed and a heavy doctor’s bill
followed.
Atherton”: A dog that stowed aboard our
lugger during a cruise among the Torres Islands
earned Ins keep as a look-out man. He literally
smelt a reef, even when the coral was not showring
above water. If We were approaching one at night
he d run up in the bows and whine plaintively. In
the day he’d bark even though we couldn’t see a
warning curl of foam. He was never mistaken,
though at times we were. As we had a lot of night
cruising in dangerous waters, he w r as far and away
the most valuable member of the crew. It was
the first cruise he’d signed on for, and the skipper
wouldn’t let him sign off at the finish.

“Pick” : Domestic animals arc not the only
homers. For is months a Hunter’s Hill (N.S.W.)
lesident kept a tamed seagull. He then parted with
it to a friend living three miles distant on the
Lane Cove River. The gull was transferred to the
new home in a closed box, so had no opportunity
of seeing the way. Its wing-feathers were cut, and
for some days it did duty amongst the slugs and
caterpillars in its new owner’s garden. Then it dis-
appeared. A fortnight later, much maimed from
encounters with wayside mongs, the poor fellow
limped into the yard of its former owner. There,
in its customary basking corner, it began to preen
its bedraggled feathers with a home-again air.
* * * *
“Wart”: One of the prettiest little ani-
mals of the Tassie bush is the bettong, known to
bushinen as the rat-kangaroo. Another species, to be
found also on the mainland, is called the wallaby-
rat. The difference in the vernacular names well
distinguishes them. The rat-kangaroo is a daintier
and slighter little chap than the other, and wears
a white-tipped tail. This tail is prehensile, and with
it he carries pieces of grass and strips of stringy-
bark quite long distances to make a nest. With
the aid of a dog I caught a ha If-grown specimen and
took it aboardship. He was there given a cartridge-
bag over a bunk for a home, and took to it imme-
diately. He drank condensed-milk from a spoon, and
ale soaked bread from our fingers. He was not a
bit afraid of us, but bopped about the boat like a
tiny kangaroo.
*_* * *
“Morob” : One of the horrors of the north-
western coast of New Guinea is the giant brown
fepider, which frequently reaches a length of 4in., and
is mostly found near swamps. There do not seem 10
be on record any cases where its sting has caused
the death of a man, but there are plenty of instances
in which the most excruciating agony, accompanied
by the swelling of tine glands in the thighs and
armpits, nausea and general incapacitation lasting for
several days, has followed its nip. Its color is gener-
ally brown, but it is able to harmonise with its
surroundings. Few living creatures in those parts
have more perfect protective coloration in this
respect. When it is killed its crushed body gives
off a vile odor, and should it be killed in blankets
or clothes the objectionable smell lingers about
them for days in spite of frequent washings.

“Till! Jumper”: “Pick” (B. l(i/7/’”5)
talks of white foals turning roan. Has he or any
other Abo. ever seen a white foal? I have not, nor
do 1 know anyone who has. Horses grey or white
when full-grown are usually of a shade of blue,
or sometimes nearly black, when born

“Tamornie”: Natives of the Bismarck
Archipelago have a method of detecting a murder
which for weirdness beats anything else I have ever
seen. On a small island out from where lfaewieng
now is, a boy had died, apparently from poison, and
steps were immediately
taken to detect his
enemy. A small hut
was erected on stakes
about 3ft. above the
ground, and in it was
Placed the head of a
freshly-killed pig. A
bamboo was then thrust
into the pig’s mouth
with the end projecting
about 10 feet beyond
the walls of the hut,
whose sides were then
covered with mats,
rendering it impossible
to be seen into. The
villagers gathered a
little distance from the
hut and, led by an old
man, chanted a song.
After this the old man
called over the names of
the villagers under his
charge, and then the
names of adjacent vil-
lagers. At the name of
Bonas, a native of
Suizat, the bamboo be-
came violently agitated.
Amid great excitement
the hut was then
stripped of its mat
coverings and the bam-
boo taken out. The end
which had been be-
was crushed and splintered. SH***

F ° r a cousidci 'able time the
whT s mflar to C “ n,cated by vibrations some-
at . sl " n | ar t 0 telephonic waves was accented
by scientists. Two other theories, that they ex-
changed notions either by actual contact or by
emitting certain odors, were also entertained. Now
an eminent entomologist announces that they convey
their messages by symbolic dancing. He kept two
colonies of bees in glass hives under constant obser-

suits to choose from, and you go and spend a fortune on a

Viition and marked one bee in particular by a
red cross on its back. Then be liberated ‘ the
branded insect, which began an eager search for
honey in the enclosed garden surrounding the hives.
Finding a clover bed, it gorged itself on the
honey and flew back to the hive, obviously to
transmit to its fellow-workers the message that
food was in the vicinity. The scientist watched
the bee s antics by means of a large magnifying
glass through the glass walls of the hive. The
marked bee, using wings and legs, began to do
a graceful and rhythmic dance with special move-
ments. Presently other bees took up the dance,
and the bee ballet moved towards the hive exit.
Out it flew, led by the marked insect, and without
one false movement threaded its way to the clover
patch. Four distinct dances were charted and
analysed. A rhythmic circling denoted a find of
honey, and the call to its mates; a rounded and
giaceful motion indicated the desire to start in
the quest for pollen : a sharp zigzag flight meant
anger; and a beautiful unvarying figure of: eight was
interpreted several times as confusion. When seekers
after honey failed, they did a different dance 'on
their return to the hive, and the other members did
not join in. Maeterlinck was right!

“Martingale”: In Queensland’s early days
it was customary for western stations to send teams
into Rockhampton for supplies. From Malvern Hills
in the Barcoo country one arrived at Priddle’s ware-
house with an order for three tanks. Old Harry
Priddle, not long since dead, sent the tanks away
with the team, but beforehand had them filled with
mm. The waggon crew had a glorious time on
the way home, but it was nothing to the spree which
followed the arrival of 'the team at Malvern Hills.
Old hands on the Barcoo still recall it with
admiration. Probably it was from this that the
expi ession “on the tank” had its derivation.

“W.P.T.”: “Jimmy Possum’s” bush cures
for rheumatism (B. 23/7/’26) remind me of the
seamen’s remedy. When an old salt felt a rheumatic
pain he had a design tattooed over the affected
part, and many swear by this ; hence the great number
of seafaring men seen with these decorations round
their joints. Many have a circle pricked round a
finger on each hand, and some assert that this was
the forerunner of the rheumatic ring.

“J.A.”: A little South Australian Jersey,
owned by L. McTaggart of Coromondel Valley, claims
a record. Although only six years and 10 months
old, she has produced eight calves, every one a
ding-donger. When 22 months old she had her first
calf; at three years old she had twins; at four, one
calf; at five, one calf; at six, one calf; at six years
and 10 months, twins. As she was sired by Leslie
Cowan’s imported bull" Makerini from a Commander
cow, she had good breeding on both sides. She
did not establish milk records, but ran them pretty
close. Her calves have accounted for many country
show prizes and bid fair to keep up the family
reputation.
“Larrapinta”: “Jim Carew” (B. 2/7/’2si
states that all traces of the petrified aboriginals
have been lost. Not quite, for a bootmaker on the
Unley-road, Adelaide, has a piece of one, which plainly
shows the pores of the
skin and the scar of
the sub-incision rite:
and a miner in Broken
Hill has part of an
arm and shoulder. It
is a thousand pities
that unique specimens
of this sort should be
broken up and lost,
instead of being housed
in public museums,
where they ought to be
safe for all time;
though, indeed, I had
an experience which
showed that they are
not safe even there. In
’B9 I took to Adelaide
a blackboy of the
Warramung tribe
named Cubbagee, who
stood Oft. 6in. high.
He was physically and
mentally the best abo-
rigine I had ever
struck. He died in the
Adelaide hospital after
an operation for a
tumor, and the Museum
authorities at once
petitioned me to allow
them to preserve the
skeleton, it being ot
such unusual propor-
tions. To this 1 con-
sented, stipulating that
it was always to re-
main in the Adelaide
Museum. A few montus
later I took a friend
to see the skeleton, but
it had been removed
from its case. On
making inquiries I was
astounded to learn that
it had been presented
to Cambridge Univer-
sity (Eng.). I saw
the Royal Geographical
Society about the mat-
ter, and such a fuss
was raised that the
skeleton was returned

‘XLX : Maftru (Vic.) will have to think
of some other explanation than that of a leakage of
electric power from a neighboring sub-station to
account for the wild and erratic behavior of horses
on coining to a certain spot in one of the town’s
streets (B. 30/7/’25) . If there was a leakage of
current, it would not be likely to affect horses in
tiie manner described, they being more or less com-
pletely insulated by their hooves, which consist of
keratin, a non-connecting substance. There have been
instances in which a horse has, without any ill-
efleet, stood on a wire carrying enough electricity to

kill half a dozen men—although, of course, had such
a wire touched the animal on any other portion of
its body, death would have been instantaneous. In
any case, the belief that it is possible for a patch of
giound to become electrified by a leakage of current
into it is one that has no scientific support. The
electricity would be disseminated far and wide, instead
of being concentrated within one particular space in-
sufficient strength to make its presence felt whenever
anybody came into contact with the area.

THE ROVER’S ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
N.S.W.
Foolish folk are we, perchance,
We who take the Rover’s Road,
Hither, thither wandering
Light of heart and light of load.
Like to thistledown are we
That the winds of fortune toss;
Little gain of gold is ours—
Rolling stones that grow no moss.
Though we do not sell our hours,
Having much and craving more,
In the pockets of our souls
Better things than coin we store.
Rovers all on rolling roads,
We are foolish folk, perchance;
Yet, for all wiseacres say,
Bright is our inheritance.
Though we mix not with the throng,
Struggling in the money-marts,
We that tread the open roads
Know the joy of open hearts.
With the whistling winds that roam
Down green glades of fern and tree,
Tossing leaves and fronds at will,
We go roving cheerily.
Far from city street and square,
By the lure of Nature drawn,
Well the stars of night we know,
Set of sun and break of dawn.
Bread of Beauty we devour
Wine of Wonder stoop and sip ;
Night and day a host of friends
Yield to us fine fellowship.
Flowers and ferns our comrades are,
Bird and butterfly and bee— •
Should we not be all content
With such graeious company ?
Day long, way long, happy birds
Sing of joy; yet, singing thus,
In repayment for their song
A.sk no minted coin of us.
Do whatever way seems good.
Wander wheresoe’er w'e will.
Fragrant perfumes for our sake
Flowers a-many freely spill.
Foolish folk are we, perchance.
We who take the Rover’s Road,
Hi I her, thither wandering,
Yet we know not spur nor goad.

_ it’s blossom time!
IUIOTORING has its advantages and attractions
AVI a ]j the year round, but “blossom time” is a
period when motorists begin to take a keener
interest in their outings, and look forward to
country trips. The lure of the bush in Spring time
appeals to most motorists—who are to be envied
their opportunities of enjoying the blossom season
in the fullest measure. Untrammelled by train or
boat, masters of pace and distance, motorists can
partake of the gifts of the bush with ease and
comfort. So fill up the tanks, pump up the
tyres, and away to the blossoms—to health and
happiness. To make your trips doubly enjoy-
able, use tyres that will carry you anywhere
free of trouble. Select dependable Australian

J. A. SAFE, Prop.
"Saaedi”: I would like to know how the
flock of black sheep mentioned by “Yarrum” (B.
30/7/’25) was bred. 1 have had many black ewes,
but have never known one to breed a black lamb.
If a white ewe has a black lamb, the odds are
against her repeating the rash act on another occa-
sion. “Yarrum” says the black sheep he saw. were
of a distinct breed, but I doubt/very much if .they
would breed black lambs invariably, as the dominant
color of their species would very often reappear.
“Huffin Guffin” : The story of the bogged
bullock team (B. 6/8/’25) . recalls old Harry Wade.
Harry was our township firewood merchant and de-
livered his goods by bullock-dray. One day a
resident in the township, riding out, met Harry walk-
ing along, bullock whip over shoulder and urging
his team on with his usual gentle “Com’ ere, Sar!
Come ’ere, Sar!” Harry stopped to speak to him.
propping the whip on the ground and. leaning on it
in bullocky fashion, at the same time calling his
team to “Wa-a-y.” “But where’s your team, Harry?”
said his friend. Harry looked around. Not a horn
in sight! He hurried back and found the team half
a mile off standing in the middle of the road.
They had “Wa-a-y’d” themselves, and Hairy hadn’t
noticed.
* * * #
“Maginnis Magee”: “OxmeacVs” par. (B.
16/7/’25) reminds me that during the ’9l shearing
strike several J.P. squatters in the Hughenden (Q.)
district held court on their stations, and not always
at the homestead. I have a vivid recollection of
a trooper escorting a couple of law-breakers to a
drafting yard on a large sheep-station on the
Flinders River. His Worship didn’t even pause in
his work of marking lambs, but without listening to
much of the evidence blurted out: “Five pounds, or”
—after a brief pause—“three months.” I have also
seen a squatter J.P. in charge of a mob of jumbuck?
hold court on the road. Courts were often held
wherever his Worship happened to he, and not in-
frequently you had a chase to catch him. I’ve
known of them being held on Christmas Day, and
once, when the accused protested, the beak curtly
advised him to be careful or another 10 bob
would be added to the fine.
JERRY-BUILDERS, UNLIMITED.
TOURIST : “ Didn’t Hi tell you, Susan, that Melbourne ain't the
only place where this sort of thing ’appens?”
“Gouger”: The abo, puts in half his life
sleeping, one-fourtli hunting, and one-fourth play-
acting. Each tribe has at least one would-be Shaks-
peare, eager to devise a new corroboree. The boys
sailing on the pearling fleets come back full of
sailors’ yarns. All these strange experiences they
take back to their tribes, who listen open-mouthed to
the narrators’ tales, which are handed down to pos-
terity by the tribal playwright in the form of a
eorroboree. Visiting blacks from the far inland
see these new shows, and hurry back to their own
distant tribes to teach the great new corroboree
that the romantic seafarers have just brought out.
The binghis are great at mimicry, and their panto-
mimic actions of new scenes and experiences are
very realistic to the looker-on, provided he has him-
self seen the particular phase of life portrayed by
their savage fancy. But when in dead earnest they

“Ah, yes, Bill makes me go out an’ do the milkin’ in all weathers!”

keep to the old favorites handed down from the past,
telling of the coming to earth of weird gods, and
their mythical, not half-understood labors. It is
these immortal corroborees that placate the great
spirits that bring the rain to fertilise the seeds
and roots and make the game and fishes breed in
profusion.

“Boronia”: Towards the end of last sum-
mer, when walking across a large plain near Koo-
kynie (W.A.), I heard a crackling noise. It was
caused by hundreds of galahs breaking open the
double-gee burrs to get at the kernels, which they
obviously relished. The pastoralists in the country
north and east of Kalgo.rlie recognise, the value
of these birds in checking the spread of a noxious
plant, and endeavor to prevent their destruction.
* * * *
“Up North”: I suppose our aborigines are
the only race in the world who have not coveted an-
other man’s land. The boundary lines of the hundreds
of tribes are known to the last blade of grass, and
I don’t think there has ever been an authentic
instance of one tribe
permanently confiscat-
ing the country of
another. Temporary in-
vasions in the form of
tribal raids are com-
mon, but after the dis-
turbance each tribe re-
turns .to its own
ground. The reason, 1
think, is that the abo.
believes implicitly in
spirit-life. His far-
away ancestors, who
first made his country,
then the trees, the
birds, the animals and
fishes, still inhabit the
spirit-homes of his
country in the shape
of invisible but living
people. Also the com-
mon people themselves
who have died are all
there, simply waiting
their turn for reincar-
nation. Every tribe
has its own spirit-
places that home the
dead people. Therefore
no other man’s country
would be of use to him,
nor his to them, be-
cause he believes that
the spirit people who
are waiting to welcome him to the shadow land
will never leave the resting-place that was made
home for them when the world began.

“Kurn Day” : “Wingella” (B. 1.3/8/’25)
is wrong; at birth, all children are free from pig-
ment and therefore white. A “white” baby is pink
because of the dilatation of the cutaneous arteries,
not because of pigment. Abo. babies are not yellow
at birth, hut a little sallow. When the skin is
cleansed from vernix caseosa they are indistinguish-
able from white babies. The idea that grease and
charcoal hasten the darkening is nonsense. I will
be called to attend several abo. births in a few weeks,
and if “Wingella” wishes I will photograph a few for
him. In respect to white mothers darkening, all
women, white or black, show increased pigmentation
after maternity; the white mothers show it in par-
ticular areas. One woman I know, of a dark com-
plexion, had an appendicectbmy done, and the result-
ing scar was silvery white. She married, maternity
followed, and very soon the scar was dgrk brown.
This is very common, and occurs in other special
areas as well.
* * * *
Dingo-poisoners offer baits :
“Rhodesia”: Kill a young calf and rip a strip
of hide off its flank. Sprinkle as much strychnine
as would cover a sixpence on the exposed flesh. A
little bicarbonate of soda sprinkled over the poison
makes the “dope” act quicker. Handle the calf as
little as possible and see that the bait is laid near
water. With the aid of a drink of the latter taken
after his meal, the dingo won’t go far before he
throws a seven.
“Boronia”; Dip a sheet of fairly thick paper into a
strong solution of cyanide, and when thoroughly dry
cut into pieces of about an inch square. Now envelop
each square in a small ball of mutton-fat. taking
care that the hands do not come into contact with
the grease. If these baits are discreetly laid, there
ought to be good results.
“Cobber o’ Mine”: (1) Get a deep vessel (a cocoa-
tin will do) and fasten it with wire to a post or
something secure. Fill it with fat in which about
a saltspoonful of strychnine has been well mixed.
The tin being too narrow for a dog to get its
nose into, the brute will start licking and remain
on the job till the poison has had time to take
effect. (2) Make a hole in the ground by driving
a crowbar straight down about a foot or 18in. Tllen
put a fairly ripe piece of meat in the bottom of 'it.
Finally lay a small, well-poisoned bait on top \oi
the hole. The smell of the buried treasure will
entice most dingoes to start prospecting till the
first course has had time to disagree with them. ;
* * * *
“Loco”: Can any scientific member of tl e
Circle explain this? It is night, and the indicator
and gauge-glass lamps are alight in the loco. 1
sound the engine whistle. Instantly, and for tl e,
duration of the whistle, the flame of the lamps flan s
up to about double its ordinary size. As soon as I
shut off the whistle the lights go back to normal.
The whistle is outside the cab ; the lamps are inside.
Kerosene is used in them with “Barton” burneri|.
As I am travelling at, say, 30 miles an hour, the
cause can hardly be the rush of steam causing’
a partial vacuum around it, as the movement would
supply the air that might he drawn up by the
escaping steam.
* * * *
“Emel”: The custom of observing strict
continence during certain seasons, as mentioned by
“Tamornie,” is very common among savage racesj
and relics of it may be traced to-day even in
civilised Europe. The rule of chastity for hunter
and fisher before, during and after the season for
the practice of his craft obtains in places and among
peoples as widely separated as New Guinea, the
Indians of Nootka Sound and British Columbia, the
Caroline Islands, the Esquimaux of Behring Strait,
"and others, the period of observance varying. This
practice of continence for the purpose of promoting
the growth of the crops is still observed among the
Central American Indians, while similar observances
have been noted among the Germans of Transylvania,
at Kalotaszeg in Hungary, in a Central Australian
tribe and in some of the Melanesian Islands. Other
races, though, seek to stimulate the growth of crops
by exactly opposite methods.

“Returned Empty” : Whilst the Council is
looking for the hottest place in the world, I am
sitting here, at noon, in tropical Queensland with a
rug over my knees and yet as cold as a frog. In
my garden in the last week the beans, peas, tomatoes,
balsams and zinnias have been killed by frost, although
the tomatoes were protected with woolbales. Even
the hardy bougainvilleas were badly hit, and the
horse trough was covered with ice. This dry, healthy
western climate is remarkable for its extreme tempera-
tures. In the same spot I have seen the thermometer
at 13deg. and 124 deg. Fah., and a variation of
40deg. or 50deg. in a day is quite common. On
Friday at sunrise the temperature was 27deg.; at
2 p.m. 77deg. ; and next morning 31deg.
* * * *
“Herodot”: Few people are aware that
ordinary tea, if sprinkled plentifully through clothes
which are about to be put away, will keep moths
and similar pests from attacking and destroying
them. Moreover, its efficacy in this respect continues
much longer than does that of mothballs and other
preservatives. The power of the leaves seems to be in
their odor, which is strongly objected to by most
Varieties of insects, and they retain it for very long
periods, the aroma of samples of tea years old being
just as fresh, as when new. One well-known Aus-
tralian actress, who frequently has occasion to put
away quantities of clothing when she is going on
tour, swears by the virtues of tea as an insecticide.
“Cwrw Bach”: “J.G.’s” little list of orna-
mental flowering trees (B. 16/7/’25) is very good,
though subject to amendment according to climate
and locality; but to find a true appreciation of
these Australian products one has to go to Cali-
fornia. According to Herbert J. Ruinsey (who repre-
sented the Australasian nurserymen and seedsmen at
Wembley), there 'are far more and better Australian
trees in cultivation in California than in any part of
Australia. . California nurserymen’s catalogues list
Australian trees almost exclusively for street-plant-
ing, etc., arid one railway company has planted
hundreds of acres with blue-gums (E. globulus) for
sleepers. It is a fact that most Californians are
blissfully ignorant, that the blue-gum, the silky-
oak and one or two other trees are not natives of
their State. At the San Francisco Exposition
a five-year-old log of E. globulus was shown. It was
considerably over a foot in diameter.

“X2X”: “Nakh” refers (B. 30/7/’25) to
the belief that gum-trees give off an exhalation by
night which is fatal to plants growing close to them.
Because of their peculiar physiology, quite different
from that of animals, trees and plants do frequently
become active in suc-h a manner after dark, gases
being then discharged. Mostly these gases are simple

bodies which are the by-products of the breaking-up
of compounds in the cellular metabolism of the plant,
but occasionally they can be extremely harmful to
animal life. There is a South American shrub giving
off by day a poisonous exhalation which becomes
greatly increased in volume by night, and is strong
enough to kill insects and even small birds. An-
other, a West Indian plant, is perfectly harmless by
day, but its nocturnal exhalations are so powerful
that men sleeping under it, or close to it, have
been affected. There is no scientific reason why
the Australian gum-tree should not be also in the
category. It is a well-known and established fact
that small plants will not grow in the vicinity of
gums; it is not at all unlikely that the reason is
they give out some toxic emanation.

[Copy]
THE MANAGER,
MEGGITT LIMITED,
Melbourne, Vic.
“Koornong” Station,
Hamilton, Victoria.
27th July, 1925.
Re SHEEP NUTS SUPPLIED BY YOU.
Dear Sir, —During the 45 days ending 21st May, the 2660 lambing ewes here received 4oz. Sheep Nuts daily, and about 11b. each
of oaten hay every second day. The cost of the nuts, including freight and distribution, was £l5 3 6s. 6d., or Is. 2;fd. per sheep, oi 2 1-5 pence
per sheep per week.
The result of the feeding has been an exceptionally easy lambing, a light death-rate among the ewes, in spite of a dry March an
April, much better conditioned ewes than in previous seasons of a similar kind, and about 520 more lambs than we could possibly have hoped
for otherwise. . , ,
I attach a record of the last six lamb markings. Those in 1920 and 1923 were affected, just as this one in 1925 has been, by cny
weather in March and April; but in the two former cases May and June were exceptionally wet, rough and cold months, whereas this year
May and June have been almost ideal for this district; hence I conclude “49 per cent, of lambs in 1920 and 47 per cent, in 1923 would have
meant “60 to 65 per cent, in 1925“ had not your Sheep Nuts been used.
The use of the Nuts added fully 20 per cent, in 1925.
Of the 43 deaths among the ewes, 12 at least were caused by the nuts blocking the windpipes of the ewes. 1 his happened after
rain had eventuated on 1 Ith and 12th May—the ewes would be cold and hungry and eat them too greedily. ,
Our lambing here always commences about the Ist day of May. This year this station missed all rains until llth of May,
9 a.m. on the 12th—243 points had fallen. I anticipated a disastrous lambing; but, for a wonder, the weather remained warm, and your
Sheep Nuts had kept the ewes in good order. £ , (in
I estimate that by spending £153 6s. 6d. on Sheep Nuts l have saved the lives of about 50 ewes and j2O lambs, to-day worth i,oUU,
and will shear ilb. more wool in November from the 261 7 ewes worth £9O. Nett gain, about £5 37. . , . „
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) W. N. C. ELLIS.

To the profit estimated by Mr. Ellis must be added the value of the Nitrogen, Phosphoric
Acid and Potash which reaches the soil by the feeding of 10 tons of MEGGITT’S PURE LINSEED
SHEEP NUTS. On to-day’s fertilizer values this figure would be approx. £5O, making in all a
net profit of £587.

was Marie Eaton, an Italian priina donna
resplendent in crimson velvet and millinery
touched up with black beads and feather
trimming. In operatic role, with high Span-
ish comb holding yards of black chiffon veil
over trained black velvet apparel, Marie was
commanding. In her “Don Giovanni,” scene
Jean Robertson’s dark hair was covered with
a Juliet cap of pearls, and her raiment was
of lemon-hued brocade. Eileen Sparks, out
of her element as a German operatic star,
wore a fawn plaid ensemble suit, fur-
trimming. Moscovitch, in bronze satin
dressing-gown over immaculate oyster-grey
trousers and red slippers, caused devastation
amongst the feminine portion of the audience.
Mr. and Mrs. I. Gutman, the Kyrle Bellew
couple aud Mr. and Mrs. Glass, whose son
Dudley has just gone to America and the
Continent for fresh musical inspiration and
to place some more of his compositions, were
among the noticed.
The younger set had a night out at the
Playhouse when A. A. Milne’s “The Roman-
tic Age” was played by youthful amateurs
for the funds of the Societies for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Children and Animals;
and such a chattering between acts never was
heard. Mrs. MeCallum Neil, Mrs. Frank
Stogdale and Mrs. W. M. Robins had numer-
ous charmingly gowned lassies selling home-
made sweets, programmes and blossoms of
early spring. Charmingly staged and frocked,
ihe performance deserved even an adult: clap.
Elsa Andrew, who as Melisande finds that
romance ends in the proper making of bread-
sauce, was, first, a pretty ladyc of the wood
iu flowing draperies of pale green, roses
wreathing her fair tresses; aud then a nice
flapper of to-day in gold-lace evening finery.
The sweetest of blue frocking beneath which
silver lace peeped was part of Joyce
a’Beckett’s wardrobe as Jane. Jazz and supper
on the stage ended the evening. - During the
interval, Harry Gullett put up a plea for
extra support in membership for both soci-
eties. The committee which organised the
entertainment was headed by Mrs. J ames
Gatehouse, the president of the S.P.C.C.
The Stradbrokes are looking forward to
the return of daughter Helena from Egypt.
Like her mother, she is a keen Girl-Guider,
and interest in the big'effort on October 8
will be strengthened by her arrival.
The Lyceum Club saw an interesting
ceremony the other night when John Monash
iuvested Maurice Carton, till 1921 Profes-
sor of French at Melbourne Uni., with the
Cross of Chevalier de la Legion d’Houneur,
and also pinned the coveted order on French
Consul Rene Turck’s lapel. The Societe
Litteraire Frangaise was responsible for a
programme consisting of speeches, music and
a bit to eat. Our General took no liberties
with the language, keeping to his mother
tongue except when he had to pronounce the
solemn words of investiture. The Consul,
whose diplomatic service covers 20 years, lias
been in these parts since 1918. Those who
added harmony to the. evening included Mrs
Turck, who warbled in nicely-modulated
mezzo-soprano notes and a frock of gold-
and-jose brocade.
The ministering angels of St. Vincent’s
added their voices to the big appeal in a house-
full of jazz at St. Kilda Town Hall. The blue-
and-gold decorations of Melbourne Gram-
mar’s dance were lent, St. Vincent’s “coat-
of-arms” being the only addition. Mrs. D.
Plant, whose white gown was embroidered
in silver and crystal, aided the 12 hostesses,
among the dozen being Nurse Conway, whose
frocking was of orange tone, chenille em-
bossed ; Freda F'atzeus, in petunia georgette;
Eileen Brown, in mauve brocade; M’arjorie
Kennedy, with fuchsia-shaded georgette upon
silver lame ; and Kitty O’Brien, whose dull
green was brocaded in velvet in brown tones,
with godets of mauve georgette. Nurses
Margaret Byrne, Skehan, Riordan, Ida Kelly,
Violet Walsh, Nan Tunbridge and Ita
Whelan were the organisers. The medical
panel included the Hugh Devines, Maurice
Macgillicudys, Murray Mortons and C.
Finns. The Tallis dame threw mink furs
over deep cream frocking, Mrs. W. M.
Robins glistened in pink, and Laila Hundt
dangled gold grapes from a coiffure baudeau
above gold frocking.
Further recognition of its friends by the
French Government came to light at the
monthly soiree of the Alliance Franc;aise in
the Victorian Artists’ Galleries. French
Consul Turck had medals of gold, silver aud
bronze to present; and two books had been
sent for Miss Georgette Jutz, who had writ-
ten a brilliant composition in French on
Flaubert. Of those singled out for special
honor were Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, president of
the Alliance Frangaise, and Mrs. Gay, a
vice-president.
More gorgeous weather could not have
been even prayed for than shone on the Oak-
lands Hunt Club’s Cup meeting at Moonee
Valley. A course beautifully green and
wattle-trees a-bloom formed the attractive
setting for smart coats, ensemble suits and
bright millinery. Mrs. S. M. Bruce added
grey furs to navy kasha topped by a felt
hat of petunia-pink; Mrs. A. V. Hiskens
wore black ensemble with millinery of black
and feather mount; Eflie Ball aired hand-
some furs with black; Mrs. Barry Thom-
son, whose black frocking was covered with
a black musquash coat, ermine-collared, had
with her Mrs. Carlos Basualdo, a beautiful
American dancer who is honeymooning
round the world with her Argentine million-
aire husband. The lady was a vision in
grey. Mrs. Wallace Mitchell favored naty
apparel and contrasting headpiece.
Lord Stonehaven will be tlie first Austra-
lian Governor to give a lead in flying, and
that lead may provide tbe social impetus to
make ’planing popular. One of tlie new
G.-G.’s gentleman-helps is a Royal Air Force
man, and his inclusion in the menage is said
to have resulted from his brand-new Excel-
lency's desire to have a familiar pilot for his
aeroplane. The time may arrive when the
G.-G. really will “drop in” on squatters whose
country holdings he has made a promise of
seeing.
Under an unwritten law the audience that
patronised Alberto Zelmau’s Symphony
Orchestra concert at the Athenaeum came in
any sort of clothes and its second-best hat.
Luckily on this occasion it did not know that
the venerable “Messiah,” upon which the
dust has never time to settle, was to be
sung, or to a person it would have brought
the score. Arthur Jordan displayed a fashion-
plate figure and a line tenor voice of unusual
clarity. The house was glad to hear that
the singer was i saying not good-bye hut
merely so-long.
A shilling will buy an annuity of a pound
per week for life for someone —such is the
tempting prize competed for by those who
subscribe a Colonial Robert to the art-union
engineered by the Sisters of Charity of the
Catholic Ladies’ College. The drawing will
be towards tlie end of the Eastern fete,, which
is being held in the College, grounds from
September 19. Artists from the “No, No,
Nanette” company will head the bill of talent
at the cafe chantant at Carlyon’s on Sep-
tember 15; Mr. Spencer, tlie new proprietor
is giving the ballroom and music free.
This bright-looking little lady is clever

ba s recited,
and she walked
off last year
with the cham-
pionships of
the Ballarat (South-street) and Tasmanian
competitions. She intends giving a recital at
the Playhouse on September 10, when violin-
ist Cecil Parkes, tenor George Grainger and
Eric Fox will lend their aid.
The dainty Lucille Lawrence, who makes
attractive melody at the Athenaeum with
Edna Thomas, comes of a family of harpists
> —her great-great-grandmother wielded the
plectrum. America, under the guidance of
a very brilliant Frenchman, is paying much
attention to the harp. At a conference of
devotees held in that city recently, 200 per-
formers were upon the stage, and the dig-
nified strains of Handel’s “Largo” rose from
as many mellow-stringed instruments.
Nearly a year ago a Bulletin artist built
a humorous page on the sporting innovation
of Christ Church, Hawthorn, which, alter
providing itself with a soldiers Memorial
Hall at a cost of £5OOO, handed over the
Parish Hall to the men of the congregation
as a club, and installed a billiard-table. Ihe
drawing has now a place of honor in the
club’s decorations; aud a second billiard-
table has been installed. To christen it
George Gray gave a display of fancy bil-
liards ; and Harry Gray and the Lev. J. rl.
Raverty, yicar of Holy Trinity, Lhornbury,
played an exhibition match —the parson
showing no little proficiency at the game in
which excessive skill was alleged by Luskin
to be the sure sign of a mis-spent youth.
Christ Church, the hall which is now
the clubroom and the vicarage attached arc
amongst the oldest church buildings in Mel-
bourne, dating back to the earliest ’fitties;
but tlie mind of tlie church is several de-
grees broader than it was in those days.
Behold Ethel Spowers, whose talent runs
to water-colors, charming wood-cuts and
clever pen-and-
ink sketches.
She has just
concluded a
brilliantly suc-
cessful show,
I i b e r ally
sprinkled with
red spots, at
the New Gal-
lery. This was
her first exhi-
bition since re-
turning from
Paris, where
she continued
h e r studies
after a full
course at our
National Gal-
lery. Wood-
cuts, she says,
are the rage in
London, where
there is a soci-
ety for this branch of, art alone. Broothorn
has pictured the intelligent Australian, Avliose
sister Ellison has earned a name at book-
binding, and is well known as a hospital
svorker.
A charming quartette, daughters of tlie
Jim Stairs of Hawthorn, made a shining
success of their dance at the Embassy one
night last week. About 250 of tlie younger
set enjoyed themselves while father and
mother looked on, Mrs. Starr wearing velvet
of peach hue over champagne georgette. Of
tlie youthful hostesses two are still in tlie
schoolroom. Eileen, the senior of the con-
stellation, struck an Oriental note in man-
darin satin and ecru Margot lace, with
goblin-blue roses on one shoulder. _ Floral-
patterned silver lame and fuchsia-shaded
georgette clothed Ryta ; Elma’s brocaded blue
frock was touched up with cerise; Car-
myle was a study in gold-embossed tissue and
blue roses. Dr. O. Finn, Mrs. Finn in glis-
tening pink; Eileen Castles, in gold lace and
tissue; Dr. and Mrs. H. V. Mattingley;
Sylvia and Lurline Heunessy ; Nell Wimpole,
Joyce Herschell, Dr. R. Mills (of the Alfred)
and Dr. Walker were of the party. Vivienne
Knox Knight, in. gold lace and lame, pro-
vided some intricate stepping with Desmond
McMinn.
A guide to Melbourne painted our violet
farms in such attractive fashion —“you may
gather a bunch of the fragrance without tea
for sixpence, or with refreshment for a shil-
ling”—that a Sydney visitor desired fulfil-
ment of the alluring picture. His wife sug-
gested it would be much less bother to buy
a posy in the city and tea in the hotel lounge,
but xmdaunted he commissioned a taxi. When
the meter had clicked out 13s. the goal was
reached. The tourist’s request for tea was
met with “Afternoon tea is only on Satur-
days and Sundays.” The Harbor city visi-
tors pleaded just for tea to be made while
they plucked some violets. “Sorry, hut we
haven’t any—the frost killed them all,” mur-
mured the flower-farmer; and the yellow taxi
Went on ticking up the traybits.
At the invitation of the staffs of a number
of city business houses a thousand or more
jazzed a substantial cheque into the Queen
Victoria Hospital moneybox at the Wattle
Path Palais one night last week. Lady
Forster graced the tripping in black em-
broidered in gold, a nice background for her
presentation posy of purple pansies. Mayor
Brunton came with his Mayoress, whose
draperies of black were crystal headed; and
Mrs. Norman Brookes §wung flared frocking
of silver matelasse bordered with white fur.
The honors for the successful event rested
largely with Edward N. Berry, who has since
departed for a trip abroad.
Song and story forn\ed the offering of
contralto Violet Somerset and elocutionist
Eleanor Floyd at the Queen’s Hall the other
night. The elocutionist contrived atmo-
sphere by dressing to suit selections —a
Chinese harmony in green, black and mauve
for Oriental verses, and Grecian draperies of
purple for Swinburne’s “The Making of
Man.” The singer was- clothed in mauve
and silver tissue with georgette interludes of
fuchsia tones. Daffodils, wattle and heath
were handed over the footlights in recognition
of the maidens’ talents.
A unique attraction of Spring Garden
Week, to be loosed by the Nurserymen and
Seedsmen’s Association of Victoria on October
7 at Wirths’ Olympia, will be a display
of wildflowers from all over the conti-
nent. This section, if properly looked
after, be the most interesting one of a
show from which the Cronin Horticultural
Scholarship fund should reap a good harvest.
Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Dyer bade the mem-
bers of the British Music Society to Kin-
noull one night last week to listen in a
bower of peach blossom and pussy willow to
the annual report. After the routine busi-
ness tenor Arthur Jordan sang Vaughan
Williaihs’s “On Wenlock Edge,” and Miss
Hull was heard to Elsie Fraser’s accompani-
ments. Mrs. Dyer, who is lion. sec. and
mainspring of the Vic. centre, announced the
glad tidings that she had less than a hundred
pounds still to gather for the endowment fund
of £lOOO required; also, that the centre could
now boast of a club-room in the Auditorium.
Host and hostess having been re-elected trea-
surer and secretary, guests were bidden to
supper.
The members of Caulfield’s Convalescent
Hospital Auxiliary rejoiced when the kiosk
which they intend running for the benefit of
tlie hospital and the convenience of visitors
and staff was duly opened with a golden key
by Mrs. A. E. Morris, Caulfield’s Mayoress.
Mrs. Fleming'Dunstan, lion, sec., handed a
Tied Cross flag to George Syme, president
of the Melbourne Hospital, who hoisted it
over the'new building. It has taken only
three months to collect the capital to erect
and stock the venture—something of a re-
cord. A gift evening held at the home of
Mrs. Alex; Tresize helped to provide much
of the stock, which was freely bought by
visitors.
Old Con students fraternised at the Uni.
clubhouse one night last week, at tire i vi-
tation of president J. Sutton Crow and his
wife. The hostess glistened in black, and
lion. sec. Winifred Mitchell, clothed in pink
draperies, assisted in the entertaining. Lilian
George was one of the songbirds.
An Adelaide postscript:—
Tlie Town Hall echoes were charged heavily with
brogue on the night of Laurence Power’s benefit con-
cert, to which Schilsky, Harold Wylde and Irene
Kemp lent a hand, with Kathleen Meegan as accom-
panist. Power’s sweet tenor was tried at everything,
from grand opera to ballads and from oratorio to
quasi-humor. There were flowers en masse for his
feminine supporters and cigars and a laurel wreath
for himself. The singer’s passage is booked for
Italy, where he will further investigate the mysteries
of grand-opera technique.
There has been another concert for Helene Taylor,
too—this time from the Glee Club, which has already
netted over £4OO on her behalf. And at an exhibi-
tion of Hal croze eurhythmies by Miss Heather
Cell's pupils, proceeds, were ear-marked for Marjorie
Bonnin, bound overseas in quest of the London
school’s teaching certificate.
The weather spilt itself over the Oval on the
afternoon fixed for the Girls’ Schools sports, making
so complete a mess of things that the results of
such events as were contested were cancelled, and
the entire gathering adjourned to extract such con-
solation as it might from cakes and tea. The new
date is September 17.
Dr. A. V. -Benson is back from Asia by way of
Darwin and Thursday Island. On his travels he
encountered Professor Watson, once the presiding
genius of anatomy at the Uni. and now engaged in
research work and the dissection of queer creatures
on the Daly.
Two useful committees have taken stock of their
year’s work—the T. B. Soldiers’ Aid Society and the
Creche. For tlie former the year’s takings total
£4534 and expenditure was £2540. Clive Carey
and Laurence Power were among the contributors to
the concert that followed the business meeting, and
there was an address on Toe H. from Dr. Duguid.
The Creche has taken under its splendid wing 5415
children in the year, and 178,735 since it was first
opened.
The Wager exhibition of handicrafts- —hand-
wrought jewellery and hand-weaving—at the Dunster
Galleries was opened by the Deputy-Governor’s lady.
Pressure of work kept the exhibitors in Sydney, but
they sent over as their proxies delightful examples
of their work —almost a novelty in this village.
The Bach Society and the South Aus. Orchestra
combined in two excellent productions of “Every-
man”—the baton in the hands of Dr. Harold Davies
and Clive Carey as chief soloist. It is 14 years
since it was first given here—well enough, but not
within hailing distance of this week’s performances.
Married this -week, at the Church of the Holy
Innocents, Belair, Edward C., second son of the C. J.
Seagers, to Mavis, daughter of the F. G. Joneses, of
Springbank. Like his two brothers, the bridegroom
was an Anzac. With an eye to sheep rather than
fruit, he chose Kangaroo Island instead of the Mur-
ray for his post-war activities.
The Agricultural Society is to hold its September
show in the new grounds *at Way ville. They have
been in progress for years, but were dropped for
a time, and the Old Jubilee Oval pitch returned to.
Proceedings start this Saturday with a buckjumping
“championship of Australia.”

Hcnri Verbrugghen, avlio may even tear
himself aAvay from the much-flaunted attrac-
tions of the. Minneapolis orchestra to lead
Victoria toAvards the musical light, suffered
and gave various parties last week. ike
State Orchestra and some musicians decided
to give the little conductor a beano, but imp-
ish fate led them to engage the Feminist
Club’s dining-room for the party. -Now, the
ways of the Feminists being as complex as
their sex, their dining-room has been put
under the management of one of the hospital
auxiliaries. From the auxiliary the musi-
cians hired the room, and in innocence laid
in an assortment of thin red wino and lager
to make merry. But, behold! at four-thirty
of the afternoon of the party tAvo of then-
number, emerging from the lift with bulging
bag, were stopped on the threshold ot the
dining-room by a Personage of the Club who
held the door with a tract: “Abandon, hops
all ye who enter here!” The dining-room is
part of the great Feminist organisation, and
the Feminist is dry even as the Rechabitc.
They fled, and that evening the corkscrews
had ainight off.
N.S.AV.'s first Avoman M.P. has spoken.
One day last week she up-ended and like a
human Niagara sAvept the House with a
resistless flow of words. B v ne spoke of many
things during the hour and a half that her
contralto, vibrant and untiring, outlined the
course she meant to steer on the political
sea. Of course she touched at some length
on the need to segregate the feeble-minded,
though one could only judge from her wither-
ing scorn that the State has already done
something to segregate its feeble-minded by
sending them into Parliament. Still, that
lea\ T es it too late: earlier action has been
the lady’s pet theme for years—she has
preached it in street and train, over the
lunch lamb and beside the baby’s pram. And
she had a few blistering remarks to add on
the unnecessary waste of mother-life. In
short, we are feeling more than justified in
our member. Of one thing there can be no
doubt; she’ll earn every penny of her salary
no matter what increases Time may haA ? e in
store for her.
Prince Alfred in Sydney is trying to cateli
up with the Alfred in Melbourne in the mat-
ter of being completely equipped Avith radio.
The great Southern hospital, which has a
complete outfit allowing each of 300 pati-
ents to haA T e the use of his oavii headphone,
was the first in Australia to adopt the
scheme. The saAing in Avear and tear on
nurses and other attendants is said to cover
the cost of the equipment, and the boon has
been found to materially hasten the recoA-ery
of many sufferers. The big Sydney hospital
has already had a de luxe central set donated
to it, but is still lacking the ’phones. Of
these 500 are needed at a cost of two guineas
each.
A Sydney girl and her mother, visiting
Scotland, sauntered into Kirkcaldy the other
day and found Australia’s old G.-G. busy
holding a garden fete in aid of the county’s
district nurses. Of course, the Sydneyites
felt they had to drop in and pay their re-
spects eA'en at a distance. From the front
gate to the house the drive to Lord Novar’s
mansion is two miles long, and the grounds
are magnificent with timber and lakes and
flower-terraces, rose gardens and vistas, a
dew pond and everything. The opening cere-
mony took place on tho granite steps leading
up to the front door; and who should he
Avaving the wand of fair speech but Nellie
Melba! She looked very slim, and wore a
two-piece costume the shade of nicely-milked
coffee; a feather-trimmed, snug-fitting hat
of the same tone, a double row of pearls and
a lorgnette finished off the good work. Lord
Novar (accent on the var, please) stood by
with his slight-almost-to-attenuation Lady
Helen. She Avore dark blue marocains over
which two rows of pearls shed their lustre.
Tea was served in the stableyard—a huge
square surrounded by buildings. Here the
crowd was so great that the Australians,
seeing that the stable had been whitewashed
and arranged with tables, had their tea
in a stall! Then, feeling the call of home,
they paid 6d. a piece to view the Australian
curios.
One of the newest pupils enrolled at the

The new man is an ex-soldier, son of that
Dr. Angel Money who was a bright star in a

Though you missed her while she and her
husband were staying at the Wentworth, if
you have an early summer number of Vogue
you can see for yourself the type of beauty
that draws a four-million husband. A girl
Avith soft, dark, laughing eyes, a piquant
rather than perfect nose, and a miraculous
set of teeth, wearing a jolly little sports hat
and jumper, glows at yon from above a foot-
note that tells you she is Leonora Hughes.
Leonora when she met her Senor Basuahlo
from the Argentine was turning the heads
of London and the south of France with
her beautiful dancing. The Basualdo couple
left Sydney for Melbourne last week.

Hawaiian dancing-girl plucked the bauble
for the most original costume. To tlie revels

young man’s partner was dressed as the
flautist- —curling mnstachios, ornate golf
stockings and all. Later on Galli danced
with the copy of herself and the flautist with
his shadow. Kate sang one night at a con-
cert. Afterwards the little priina donna
rushed up to her and almost embraced her,
crying: “Oh, you are a great artist! Same
timbre as Clara Butt, and such soul! You
stirred the heart!”
Probably the most successful of its dances
Avas presented by the Not Forgotten League
at the Wentworth last Friday. The funds
from this yearly gathering are directed to
the help of T.B. soldiers and sailors, and
there has never yet been a poor response to
the committee’s appeal. Mrs. Richard
Hagon, who was president of the dance,
viewed the buzzing ballroom and palm court
from a table SAveet with a brimming basket
of stocks. Indeed the flowers that had come
from the gardens of Kuring-gai were one of
the night’s greatest charms. The Stanley
Davenport, Edmund Playfair and AV. 11.
Perry matrons were vice-presidents, and Mrs.
Harold Vale and Mrs. Gordon Robertson sec-
retaries.
When Joseph Ward Avas Prime Minister
of Maoriland from 1906 to 1912, his grace-

always garbed
in the most at-

in the little
Dominion. And

its admiration
of the lady

life a friend says: “I loved the simple,
natural manner in which she brought up her
children. I Avas having morning tea Avith
her in her Wellington home when she put
down her darning-basket to leave the room.
Pat Ward, then a small boy, helped himself
to another piece of cake. ‘We make our
OAvn cake,’ he remarked quite casually: ‘lt
comes cheaper!’” The lady is over on a
A'isit to Sydney, and stepped up to May
Moore’s camera so that we might have this
little picture.
The Maitland lady’s floral fete is the big
function of this (Thursday) afternoon. The
Town Hall is to be turned into a sylvan
grove as close to Watteau and Versailles as
Time and Place will permit. Gold of the
varnished buttercup, the tawny gold of the
poppy and the dusky secret gold of the wall-
flower will be spilled from the door of the
vestibule to the stage.
This Saturday the Ilawkesbury Agricul-
tural College is putting on the smock of
carnival. The students are running a fair
with every kuoAvn sort of side-sho av. The
Spanish onions have promised a tarantella,
tlie garlic lias threatened a strong rivalry,
and the potatoes will turn all eyes on the
vegetarian saturnalia. The fund for a Sol-
diers’ Memorial Hall will benefit by the gate-
money.
The young' things who run the St. John
Ambulance Auxiliary are going to have their
forms and features immortalised in a moyie.
Girls plying a nimble hockey-stick and doing
a Lenglen dash across the courts, motoring
and ’planing, on horse and on foot, will make
Mary Pickford or Pauline Frederick eyes
into the camera, and the complete lilm will
bear the title of “The Amazons.” It will (all
going well) be released at the Adyar Hall
on October 12, and will be embellished by an
entertainment of the song-an’-dance variety
in which all the best-known flappers will
appear. The ball at the Palais, the Auxili-
ary’s last effort, resulted in £262 dropping
into St. John’s wallet.
Tresillian, the mothercraft headquarters
of the Welfare Society, will he enriched by
a kiddies’ party at the Palais early next
month. Over 2000 small guests are expected.
Fancy costumes will be the usual wear, a
Peter Pan set has been arranged by Mrs. A .

a Pageant of Childhood. Elaine de Chair is
the youthful patroness, and energetic organ-

Father Christmas.

ported by the violinist and Mary Charlton
at the' piano.
The younger musicians of Sydney added
harmony to Trixie Tange’s very last public
tea-drinking in Sydney. It Avas in the black-
and-white room of the Mary Elizabeth, and
Avas really the ornamental border decorating
the valedictory cheque. Very happy Beale’s
new concert-manager, George Portus, felt, too,
at the round £B5 that somebody whispered
would swell to the rounder hundred before
the Jervis Bay sailed with the young adven-
turer. Mrs. Julian Caro, senior, who has
been oue of the many farewelling hostesses
of the week, Avas among the afternoon’s
callers; so were Bertie Kelly and Mrs.
Layton-Gaubert and gifted Iris de Rego.
Something in the nature of a pantechnicon
being finally secured, the popular Trixie’s
good-bye parcels and bouquets Avere put
aboard. But there’s one gift to greet her in
Loudon that will bring three hearty cheers,
and that’s the use of a Beale piano to prac-
tise on.
Adrian Feint, Avliose bookplates are creep-

Adrian has a nine-to-five job these days. He
is in charge of the Fine Arts Gallery hi
George-street. Mr. Bennett, the former
keeper of its treasures, has gone over to join
the artistic group at May Moore’s studio.
To Mrs. Eddie Horton, Avife of him who
plays the organ at the Prince Edward Pic-
ture Theatre, belongs the distinction of wear-
ing the first pair of Russian ballet boots to
a Sydney dance. The occasion was the hop
in the ballroom of the Australia given by
the American colony in farewell to U.S.A.
Consul Lawton and his lady. The boots Averc
of lightish fawn, and from across the room
looked as though carried out in soft croco-
dile. They fitted to the ankle and then
widened out to the kuee, Cossack style. These
boots have been threatened from the States
for some months, and their actual presence is
viewed Avith mingled doubt and admiration
by the jazz girl. “Fascinating but hard to
Avear” is the verdict so far.
Pretty, dark-haired Josephine Watt, of
Coolah, is among the newly-engaged, and
matrimony will mean dwelling in Melbourne
for her. Her young man is W. G. Bayley,
of that city.
Dorothy Helmrich, already on her way
back to London engagements, has lit a torch
to ’the glory of song-interpretation in Sydney.
No fledgling singer who listened to her last
concert in Sydney could fail to be thrilled
by the extraordinary charm of the perform-
ance. Dorothy is a great artist, and if
she had not been a singer she -would inevit-
ably have become an actress. Her singing of
“Softly Awakes My Heart” in its subtlety
presented a Delilah caught for the moment
in a wave of half-sincere emotion, but with
the evil of her mind straining to translate
itself into action. A complete change came
in the laughing freshness of Alfred Hill’s
“Waiata Poi.” Pianist Frank Hutchens,
who was the strong support of the pro-
gramme, dreamed and sparkled over his key-
board; and Vern Barnett and Faunce All-
man knit into the evening a glowing pattern
of accompaniments.
Eleanor Blanche Bertin Maekinnon Kirk-
patrick, 8.A., LL.B., to give her all that
is yet her right, the second woman solicitor
in this State, is pretty and plump, has the
frequent smile that goes with a consciousness
of good teeth, and a sunny mass of hair
which has been helping to reduce the elec-
tric-light bill in the offices of Sly and Rus-
sell during her time of probation. Eleanor's
father is Robert Kirkpatrick, who manages
Callan Park.
Digger-sculptor Frank Lynch, whose
“Satyr” created a sensation when first ex-
hibited, is slowly finding an appreciative
public. At present he is working upon a
portrait bust of Hugh D. Mclntosh and also
one of John Lane Mullins. A female study
in the nude will be the young artist’s big
effort this year. The lady will make her
appearance in time for Christmas.
City Tattersall’s Club is approaching what
the psyeho-analysts call the dangerous age.
It will hold its 30th birthday to-night
(Thursday) and will celebrate the same by
throwing wide its portals to the ladies. Jazz
will be the special brew.
Wynne Whcar-Roberts, who is playing
Mayoress to Duncan Macdougall’s Lord
Mayor at the Playbox, is a daughter of the
late Whear Roberts, who Avas one of The
Bulletin’s oldest contributors. Wynne is
that rare thing a clever character actress,
not afraid of looking absurd if the comedy
calls for it. In the Playbox audience, and
one of the most enthusiastic applauders on
the opening night, Avas Mrs. Apperly, from
Melbourne. avlio was in the original produc-
tion of “The Lord Mayor” at the Abbey
Theatre.
Three years ago Cranbrook held an amaz-
ingly successful fete under the guidance ot
Judge Gordon’s energetic wife. This year
the school has decided to have another fete,
and if possible to net even more than the
thousand-odd the last drew in. Mrs. A. J.
Warry Avill president the present ven-
ture, which Mrs. Cyril Gunther is organising.
The 70 helpers include Arthur Mailey, who
is going to do lightning sketches. September
26 is the date fixed on; and there will be a
dance in the evening.
From Brisbane, back in the Middle Ages:
That portion of Brisbane which is not employed
in stop-work meetings proceeds to toil these days
by ’bus, baker’s cart, grocer’s motor-waggon, China-
man’s vegetable cart and hoof while the gentle-
men of leisure, under the shadow of the red flag,
perambulate the streets. The city milk-supply is
threatened daily, and there are thousands of tons of
fruit rotting at the markets. His Ex. is marooned
in Toowoomba, where he had gone for Polo week.
The officers of the Field Artillery mess helped a
big party to forget its troubles at Lennon's. A rosy
light suffused, the large ballroom hung with the regi-
mental blue and crinison. The C. 0., Colonel F. A.
Hughes, D. 5.0., and his lady held out the hand of
welcome, Mrs. Hughes-—one of our best dressers-—dis-
playing black charmante with Oriental touches and a
crimson posy. Mrs. Bruche was framed in black and a
pastel scarf, Sheila Mcßryde sported pink brocade,
and Kathleen St. John appeared in white.
Lots of parties have come to Marjorie Hough, who
changes her name shortly. Bessie and Edna Souther-
den gave one at Parkhill, amid Iceland poppies, rose-
colored streamers and blue birds. Mrs. Lucas gaA C
another, and Mrs. A. D. Hough and Mrs. Fisher
spread the festive cloth at the latter’s home, where
mah jongg was played amid sweet-pea and rose-pink
sweets-baskets.
For Maud Deshon, who is to marry T. Kennedy, of
Myall Plains, Mrs. C. E. Deshon had a big j olio at
the Gresham. Pale pink damask with deeper pink
stocks and poppies embellished the feast, and a musi-
cal programme sped it. Mrs. Keating, Mrs. McManus
and Eileen and Evelyn Barry sang.
The “Gappy Rieks” co. was smart enough to get
through before the stop-work order caught the ear
of tlie railway officials. The last Sydney mail-train
to get past the pickets on the 27th did not arrive
till "after eleven at night, and had to act as sweeper,
picking up passengers at the small stations en route.
The news of the death of handsome, charming Mrs.
11. J. Taylor, widow of Mr. Taylor, of Fort Constan-
tine and Rockwood, caused sorrow here amongst a
wide circle. She was visiting friends at Dubbo, and
was on the eve of returning when she suddenly
passed over.

* * * *
So far the A.J.C. has had little luck with
its Warwick Farm investment, but there was a good
crowd at the Farm on Saturday (very good consider-
ing that it was a beast' of a day), and the racing
was much above the suburban average. Also the
railway service was a distinct improvement on previous
departmental efforts. The most striking performance
was that of the Magpie—-Loved One gelding Amounis
(i to 2) in the £lOOO Hobartville Stakes, seven
furlongs. Sold during the week by trainer J. W.
Cook to A. P. Wade, the alleged price being £2600
guineas and contingencies, Amounis gladdened the
heart of his new owner by settling a big field in a
few strides after having been badly placed in the
early part of the race. And the time—lmin. 28sec. ; —
has not been beaten since the course was remodelled.
Vaals (Valais —Galtee Queen), on whom his punting
owner, Moss, has dropped a mint of money, was a
fair second, but had no chance with the winner, and
Cajole just shaded the fast-finishing Bravery for third
position. The indications are that the present batch
of three-year-olds are not nearly so good, on the
whole, as last year’s lot, but Amounis and Manfred
may distinguish themselves.
There were a few Epsom candidates in the Denham
Court Handicap, six furlongs, in which Tong Bong,
desperately ridden by Munro, got his head in front
at - the right spot, after a spirited race with Red
Gauntlet (s’s). The honors were perhaps with Red
Gauntlet, who carried lost. 11b., drew a bad marble
and had a rough passage, but Tong Bong is smart.
He has 7st. 41b. in the Epsom (he had Bst. 101 b. on
Saturday), whereas Red Gauntlet has 7st. 101 b. With
two such brilliant four-year-olds in the Epsom as
Boaster and Red Gauntlet, and that at weights to
which at least 101 b. would be added in each case
could the job be done over again, William Kelso holds
a very strong hand. Third to Tong Bong and Red
Gauntlet, but never within striking distance, was the
grey pony Little Marg, and behind her were Quixotic
(almost ready to go off again), Chateau Tanunda
and Cilix, the gelded brother to Erasmus, who got
into a scrimmage near the home turn and ran out
wide in the straight.
The M.L. gelding Pilliewinkie, with Young aboard,
was reckoned a good thing for the August Handicap,
11 furlongs, and from 3 to 1 he firmed to 9 to 4.
Mirthmaker (3’s) was also heavily backed, and when
most of the crowd had left for the stands a heavy
commission came for Dreblah (7’s), who had finished
feebly in two races at Roseliill seven days before.
The last-named nuisance, who loses whenever the
public backs him and wins when the stable has the
market to itself, led from start to finish. Momentarily
in the straight it looked as if Pilliewinkie might catch
him, but the hungry-looking Halberd—Vernonia geld-
ing had too much start. Young was not seen to
advantage on Pilliewinkie, who struck more than his
share of trouble. The M.L. jockey enjoys a great
reputation, thanks in a measure to successes on horses
,which could have won with sacks of flour on their
backs, but he is really not the equal of Pike or
Toohey, who, by the way, is nursing a fractured
leg. Mirthmaker, after running prominently for a
mile or so, turned it up in the straight. Solidify,
on the other hand, finished strongly in third position,
and there can be no denying his Metropolitan chance
with Bst.
Polycletan, Virgin Gold, Shrapnel and other good
ones were produced in the Edensor Park Handicap,
eight furlongs, and Virgin Gold, though patently
in need of a few more gallops, was sent out equal
favorite at 4’s with Chatterbox, who was making her
first attempt to get a mile. Polycletan was also
marketable at s’s, and Royal Dighton and Rahiri
had friends at 7’s. Bardoleur (10’s) made the
pace too warm for the topweights, whom neither the
course nor the conditions suited; but Atholdorus
(20’s) came from the clouds when Bardoleur seemed
to have the race in his keeping and pipped him on
the post. Rahiri, always one of the first four, was
third, and both Chatterbox and Virgin Gold were
running on conspicuously behind him after having
been in the ruck most of the way. Having shown
that she can stay a mile, Chatterbox will be borne
in mind for the V.R.C. Cantala Stakes, in which she
has the nice weight of 7st. 91b. On Saturday she
was handicapped within 71b. of Virgin Gold and
Polycletan, who was given Bst. 111 b. in the Cantala
Stakes. Tote backers of Atholdorus received £8 7s.
for 10s. in the grandstand and £9 10s. for ss. in
thc lcger reserve—this on machines which paid three
dividends, the first representing CO p.e. of a pool
from which 12} p.c. and fractions of sixpence were
deducted. And Boonala, winner of the Farm Stakes,
paid £5 7s. for 10s., his ring price being 10 to 1.
If the A.J.C. installed straight-out, place and double-
event totes, and arranged with the Government for a
10 p.c. instead of a 12} p.c. deduction, Si dney racing
would be much pleasanter and more profitable for
the public. And there wouldn’t be many course
odds-erampers left.

The importance of barrier positions in
short races was demonstrated at Aspendale Park
(Vic.) on Saturday, when Tonic, Bondi and Pine
Tale finished first, second and third respectively in
the Maiden Plate, 5 furlongs, after drawing the cor-
responding berths _at the machine. Tonic, who
started at 9 to 2, is a three-year-old chestnut gelding
by Eudorus out of that good mare Lager. There were
only four starters for the mile and a quarter handi-
cap, but it provided the best finish of the day,
Nisservand (5-4) and King Pan (3 to 1) dead-
heating for first place, with Cteur De Lion a close
third. Bets were divided. Tookarby (25 to 1), a Caul-
field Cup fancy last year, surprised by running
second to Wedding Glide (s’s) in the Aspendale Plate,
fi furlongs. He is going to Sydney for the -Metropoli-
tan, in which he has 7st. 12lb. After the third
race Heroic, who is not to be seen at Rand wick this
spring, was given a lesson in starting-machine manners,
with the colors up. He behaved a little better
than usual, but he is going to be a tough proposi-
tion for the starter to handle with all the excite-
ment and bustle of a Caulfield Cup. At the finish
of his mile and a quarter gallop with a stable-mate,
Royal Charter, lie repeated his Williamstown trick,
hanging out rather badly. He is certainly acquiring
a nice collection of bad habits. And yet there are
mugs who have taken a short price about him for
the Caulfield Cup.

“Hasen”: Alas for the way we magnify
our own virtues at the expense of and by comparison
with the faults of our neighbors! It works even
amongst our thoroughbreds. For many a moon the
ungentlemanly behavior at the racecourse of the
10,000-guinea horse, Heroic, has been a topic of con-
versation among sports throughout Australia. Before
the weight-for-age race at Williamstown on Aug. 22,
the papers printed columns of speculation on the
chances of his manners for the future. Heroic behaved
much as before. Now, in the same papers that
chronicle his continued outlawry, there have appeared
items announcing the likely sale of the Vic. Governor’s

horse, The Night Patrol. I have read four of these,
and each one not only mentions, but very definitely
emphasises, how extraordinarily tractable he is. They
give long anecdotes to prove Scobie’s statement that
he “could be led by a thread.” It’s the “Thank
God, I am not as these others” spirit to perfection.

The big racing clubs are still illustrating
the old proverb about distant fields being the
greenest. The V.R.C. having taken as its new
secretary Kewney, of the S.A. Jockey Club—which
had imported him from Westralia—the S.A.J.O.
reduced a field of 80 applicants to 2, Malone of the
local fatter sail’s Club, and Hynes of Clarence River
(N.S.W.). The latter gets the billet, and moves
down. south, after 20 years auctioneering in Grafton
and .'neatly as long an experience in managing race-
meetings. - - '

“Akran”: Most two-up players are super-
stitious. At Tel-el-Kebir (Egypt) one night after
leave passes had been issued for Cairo, Tiny was the
central figure in the school. He headed ’em 16
times at one attempt and 13 the next. When it
came to his spin again he wouldn’t have it. “No
fear,” he said, “that last time done me. Went out
on the thirteenth spin an’ I reckon me flamin’ luck
is changed for the worse.” He was right. He hit
Cairo with 200 piastres, got pinched, assaulted two
red caps, and was in the cells at Abassia when the
battalion left for France.

Hawkes and Patterson played capital
tennis in the U.S. doubles championship at Chestnut
Hills, Boston, and when they defeated W. M. Johnson
and Griffin in straight sets in tlie first semi-final, a
delighted British critic cabled to his paper that
Patterson was the best doubles man in the world, and
that the Aussies had quite a good chance of recap-
turing the Davis Cup. However, the Victorian pair
went under in the final to Richards and R. -N.
Williams. The Americans gained the first set rather
easilv 6 —2, but. after that it was B—lo,8 —10, 6—4, 11 —9.
One account suggests that Patterson and Hawkes were
caught a bit off their game, and that they would
have an even-money chance if the match were played
over again. Partnered with Miss Mclvane, the English
champion, who had previously been defeated by the
American Helen Wills, Hawkes was brilliant in the
mixed doubles. The Anglo-Australian allies obliter-
ated Tilden and Mrs. Mallory, 6 —l, 6—l, in the
semi-final, and made almost as short work of Richards
and Miss Harvey in the final, 6—2, 6 —4. Hawkes
has eminently justified the selectors who gave him
the preference over O’Hara Wood. Though Patterson
is an uncertain factor the opinion is growing that
our fellows will again defeat the French.

The golf championship of S.A. was un-
usually interesting this year, the Seaton cracks
being opposed by McMahon, of the new suburban
ICooyonga club. Toogood, the country expert, and
Russell and Quirk, from Victoria. These all qualified
in the first eight on the opening day. Russell, on
the unfamiliar ground, got in only eighth in a
large field, but McMahon headed. Legh Winser for
top place; the others to qualify; were Cheadle, Digby
Giles, and the veteran Gunson. In the championship
proper, Russell had difficulty in reaching the final,
both Cheadle and Giles taking him to the 19 th hole,
while Winser disposed of the others comfortably.
However, the Victorian reproduced some of his last
year’s form in the final, whereas Winser was not
seen to advantage, and Russell won 5 up and 4 to
play. Toogood, who comes from Port Broughton,
again won the country championship, which brought
a big crowd of competitors.

The M.L. representatives proved far too
good for the Australians in the cross-country chanr-
pionship at Wellington, filling all three places. R.
A. Rose (one- and three-mile Australasian track
champion),_ who ran second to Frank Bailey over
the ltandwick course in 1923, cleared right away
from the bunch and won with lmin. 39sec. to spare
in 36min. llsec., the distance being 10,000 metres
(6 miles 376 yards). J. H. Tapp was second, E. L.
Brown third, and the Victorian W. M. Whyte fourth.
The N.S.W. team made a poor showing; M. J. Mac-
kenzie (9), Weeks (10) and Swinburne (11) were
their best. The team points were: M.L., 12; Victoria,
30; N.S.W., 45.

Tenario Pclkey has become the merriest
of the dusky bruisers now in Sydney when the
Manilamen are abroad, instead of, as was the case
earlier in his Australian sojourn, the thundercloud
that marred the jocund day. His latest weekly bene-
fit performance at the Stadium was a match with
Bert McCarthy, the Melbourne has-been. After allow-
ing Bert to slap his face for 10 rounds, Pelkey bogged
in and had Herbert so limp in the 11th that referee,
Joe Wallis called it a night’s work for the badly
battered Victorian. The winner scaled 9st. 12|lb.
and McCarthy gave him 611 b. On the same night
Bill Grime met Stan Love, the N.S.W. lightweight
champion, at Wagga, and banged him so severely that
Love surrendered in the I7tli. firim. „

Treu” : Hartkopf’s determination to sacri-
,, "is cricket to his medical practice will weaken
the Victorian XI in all departments this season. His
influence in making Victoria supreme in Shield
games in recent years has been great, for when he
<ndnt google half the opposing side, or dismiss
some by brilliant work in thefield, he would set his
jaw and improve his batting average. Victoria’s bril-
liant win against time and the last English XU was
due t? Harty’S hitting. With 50 wanted and only
30 minutes to play Hendry kept an end up while
Hartkopf slogged. In this match the Dr. played his
usual hard-hitting pennant game; in big cricket lie
often adopted a cautious style for which he was not
nearly so well adapted. He has figured in inter-Stato
games since 1913. Pew Victorians are in Hartkopf’s
class as all-round sportsman. At the Uni. he gained
a triple blue in his first' year; he won the batting
and bowling averages of Fitzroy in 1906-7—his first
pennant season; and with University in League foot-
ball he was a great half-forward. ‘Also, in spite of
his massive frame and deliberate movements in the
field, he was a first-class quarter-miler. When he
was training for the 440 yards championship of Vie.
which he won, Miek Terry, Jack Donaldson’s handler,
remarked; “What’s the ploughman doing here?” It
was only the watch that convinced him of the doc’s
ability.
* * * *
“Hamer” : Melbourne papers looked up
Jack Blackham to get his comments on Hobbs’s feai
in passing W. G. Grace’s record of centuries. The
great stumper, who played in the first Test match in
1877, is now 70; he, Charlie Bannerman and Toni
Garrett are the only survivors of that event.
Altogether, Blackham played in 35 Test matches
before a, broken thumb put him out of the game in
the 1894-95 season. There has never been his equal
behind the sticks, and he could bat merrily when
his side needed runs.

The quality of N. «. Wales Rugby League
football has declined so greatly this season that a
Queensland second XIII (tlip- cracks were on their
way' to Maoriland) was able to whip a fairly repre-
sentative X. S. Wales side at Brisbane on Saturday.
The Queenslanders, among whom were Caples and
Oxford, former Sydney stars, won by 23 to 18. Wear-
ing was missing from the N.S.W. combination—
he helped South Sydney to down Balmain, 8 to 2,
in a willing game on a very muddy Sydney O. G.
Vic Lawrence, the cent re-threequarter, ‘got both of
South’s tries, one of which Wearing converted. In
the other match, Glebe had to plav 100 minutes before
defeating Eastern Suburbs by 15 points to 9. At
full-time the board showed 9-all, but in the extra
10 minutes each way, See and Goddard scored tries
for the Reds. None of the eight tries was con-
verted ; goal-kicking is almost a lost art in League
Rugby. South and Glebe are to play off for the
City Cup.
* * * *
Victoria’s chief League match on Saturday
was staged at Geelong, where 26,025 persons paid
£lOl9 to watch the locals meet the then runners-up,
Collingwood, and win by nine points after a strenu-
ous and over-eager tussle. The Magpies, to whom a
win meant everything, started the last quarter 25
points in arrear and would have won but for reckless
shooting by the forwards. Scores : Geelong 11 goals
8 behinds; ’Wood, 8 goals 17 behinds. Simultane-
ously, on the Melbourne ground, the Red Legs just
scraped home from ’Scray by superior shooting, getting
10 goals 9 behinds to ’Scray’s 9 goals 13 behinds.
Fitzroy, which must win every game to reach the
finals, took no risks with St. Kilda and ultimately
got home with 78 points to Saints’ 55. Essendon
kept its place by collecting 103 points to North
Melbourne’s 45 ; also, Richmond beat South by 03
points to 45, and Carlton outed Hawthorn by 80
to 51. As a consequence of Hie games, Gee-
long is now certain of the “minor” premiership.
Melbourne _ stands second and will probably stay so;
Essendon is fourth; ’W T ood is third and ’Roy fifth,
with but one game between them. The two meet
next Saturday and if ’Wood wins, the “four” are
as they stand now; if ’Roy wins, the pair are level
for fourth place and it will be a matter of per-
centages of points scored as to which goes in. So
things are likely to be lively down Collingwood way.
The Melbourne Ass.’s season closed on Saturday,
when Brunswick wiped the sward with Port. The
game was fast and clever, and there was little between
them up to lemon-time; then ’Wick clapped on extra
pace and won by 69 points to Port’s 53. The most
interesting performance of the eight Ass. teams, how-
ever, was put up by Coburg, which, a mere junior
club last season, joined the Ass. in March and ran
into the semi-finals.
THE SKIN GAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The odds were noticeably cramped.”
The man who’ll crook upon a hook,
To tempt a trout,, a worm
Is sans the sense of co.mme il fautj
At least they used to tell me so,
I steadfastly affirm.
And you must not at billiards pot
The white, except in fun.
Such caper in a serious game
Would earn the perpetrator shame ;
It simply isn’t done.
The ball they dub a “sneak” or “grub”
- That knocked the stumps awry
In mid-Victorian cricket play
Is rigidly tabooed to-day—-
I sometimes wonder why?
But in one sort, at least, of sport
No slow convention strikes
At wiles no longer deemed 0.K.,
For still MeDynamite can lay
’Most any odds he likes.

IT'S TIME TO
THINK OF CRICKET
with its charm, its associations, its triumphs and hopes 1
Every true Australian takes a keen, and frequently an active,
interest in this kind of sport; for the game has played no small part in
establishing Australia’s reputation for sportsmanship.
Many years’ experience in serving devotees of cricket has enabled U 3
to accurately gauge their requirements. Our new stock for the coming
season is replete with every need for the game.
We feature here bats with a reputation behind them, a reputation for worth and quality—and the prices, as you will
observe, are as keenly cut as they could possibly be.

“O. McKay M.”: Prahran isn’t the only
Melbourne suburb with an abo. tag (B.
20/S/’25). Moonee Ponds is half native,
anyway. Incidentally, Kendall’s poem about
Mooni (“where the water-blossoms glisten”)
is the _ only Australian piece that finds a
place in Quiller-Couch’s “Oxford Book of
English Verse.”
“Coot”: Melbourne’s first fire-engine was
imported in 1845 by the Cornwall Fire In-
surance Co., and a “Fire Prevention Society”
—Victoria’s pioneer fire brigade—was organ-
ised to work it. The appliances used prior
to the arrival of the engine were buckets
hung over the police watcn-house door ready
for use. In 1851 the existing fire-brigades
were taken over and reorganised by the Vic-
toria Insurance Co., the State’s oldest fire-
office.
“Betel-nut”: Gone below after 23 years,
the 15-ton steamer Bulldog, staunchest of
craft and a friend in need to many a fever-
stricken miner in the early days of the
Papuan goldfields. Owned by the Whittens,
storekeepers and recruiters, " the Bulldog
carried on the early coastal service to the
Ivumusi and Mambare goldfields. Many a
malaria-ridden wreck, after a perilous jour-
ey to the coast, has owed his life to the
timely arrival oi! the much-abused little
steamer. Early in her Papuan career, the
Bulldog went under off Samarai, but was re-
floated and returned to service.
“Wallaby”: Probably no well-meant
scheme ever suffered so much abuse as the
A.l.F.’s “non-military employment” insti-
tution, which enabled Diggers, whilst await-
ing repatriation, to adapt themselves for
their return to civil life. Generally referred
to as “bon military enjoyment,” the scheme
was not easily administered, owing to the
unnculty in distinguishing the genuine appli-
cant from the Digger who was simply on
the look-out. for a change of air and a good
time. Candidates were allowed to indicate
their preferences. One application ran:
“Boiler-making on the Clyde or a course of
window-dressing in Paris.”
“Green Light”: One of Vic. Railway Com-
missioner Clapp’s most robust babies is
the Betterment Board, which exists for the
purpose of receiving and investigating sug-
gestions for the improvement of the service.
Since the inception of the Board, close on
three years ago, 7709 suggestions have been
received, 1151 adopted and 132 given a fly,
while the Department lias parted with the
respectable sum of £8658 in bonuses. Pub-
licity work and advertising are carried on
under chairman Hyland’s supervision; most
of the slogans with which Clapp is credited
also flow from his facile pen. The Better-
ment Board is, nevertheless, the least popu-
lar division in the service, the heads of most
of the branches savagely resenting the out-
side investigation of their affairs which these
suggestions involve.
“Jesmond”: The idea of women’s unions,
proposed at a recent Melbourne Trades Hall
conference, is not new. At a conference of
the Loco. Engineers and Firemen (Eng.)
11 months ago, approval was given to the
formation of an associate society, all wives,
sweethearts and daughters of the men to
be eligible for membership. The object, of
course, is to ensure the support of wives, etc.,
during a strike, but in Melbourne there was
some high-sounding talk about improving the
industrial status of women. Bromley, sec.
of the English union, put it much more
sensibly: “In times of struggle with the em-
ployers an understanding body of women
can be of tremendous assistance, whereas,
when the womenfolk are ignorant of the facts,
they may be a real menace to the cause of
their husbands and lovers.”
“Jaelem”: “Ex-Dig.” recently cited a
case of hydatid cyst being removed from
close to the heart of a patient in tlie Sydney
Hospital, and claims that what he ' calls
“pulsing” the heart, which kept the patient
alive, was first discovered during the
war. He is wrong. The same thing was
done nearly 30 years ago in a way-back town-
ship in N.S.W. At an operation to remove
a hydatid cyst close to the heart the patient
collapsed, the surgeon grasped the stilled
heart and pulsed it, and a successful recovery
followed. It is a popular notion that where
vital organs such as the heart and the brain
are concerned, it is “hands off” the one and
“keep the knife off” the other. This is not
so. Years before the war there are records
of wounds of the heart being successfully
stitched, and portions of brain matter being
sliced off with impunity by the surgeon.
THE NAKED NYMPH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Well might the members of the parks and
gardens committee blush in discussing their pur-
chase of the Water Nymph. It is almost impossible
to walk through any of our public gardens without
being- confronted and embarrassed by nude statuary.
Yet the men responsible are the first to denounce
offences to which incentive is given by such things.”
“Disgusted,” in a letter to Melbourne Sun.
The prison chaplain was tired and sad;
He’d never known prisoners half as bad
As those who had come in the last ten days
With their evil looks and their furtive ways,
And he couldn’t at all make out the cause
Of so many breaches of so many laws,
Till a lad came in who was scarce eighteen,
His record showing that he had been.
With rogues and vagabonds, thieves and knaves.
Behaving as no good youth behaves.
And the chaplain asked in a whisper low,
“Pray, tell me, brother, why did you so?”
“Why, padre,” he muttered, and looked ashamed,
“I really don’t know as I should be blamed.
I was out in the park with the boys last night
And we saw a nymph in the bright moonlight,
And seeing she hadn’t a stitch of clobber
I made a joke to my nearest cobber.
“Thereat a chap who was slightly soaked
Swore that he wouldn’t hear borak poked
At a beautiful maiden in distress,
E’en though she couldn’t afford a dress,
And he swiped at me, so I passed him one,
And a John nipped in as I tried to run.”
The chaplain went to the park and sought
The nymph that the city fathers bought,
And he gazed a while with a reddening face,
And then chastely draped her in crepe and lace.
And as long as those clothes her outlines hide
There’ll be fewer disorderlies going inside.

provided by the playwright, George Gros-
smitli, not being particularly bright nor the
characterisation very clear, a serviceable grin
was the first requirement for the part.
Steyne’s grin is something different from the
grin of Frith. Frith’s is the grin of a
heathen woodland god who has been brought
within the influence of Alice’s Cheshire cat.
Steyne’s smile, the pathetic, almost tragic
smile of a beautiful soul condemned for the
term of its natural life to imprisonment in a
casket of sinful flesh, captured the sympa-
thies of a large and enthusiastic audience,
which had greeted with sobs the announce-
ment that the principal was temporarily out
of commission. For the rest, the substitute
purveyed the chestnuts baked for him by the
playwright in a sedate and individual man-
ner, being ably seconded in the business by
John Stuart, assistant stage-manager, who
stepped into the part the other had vacated.

Maude Fane commendably discharged the un-
exacting duties of heroine. Her voice is not
over-robust, but her acting is acceptable. She
does not fall into the lamentable error of all
male lovers (including the stiffly-articulated
William Senior in the piece under dissec-
tion) of facing the frivolous occasions of
“WITHIN THE LAW,” AT MEL-

musical comedy in the manner of an Othello
or an Aucassin. Winnie Collins as a social
climber was adequately vulgar, but sometimes
somewhat difficult to follow. Archie Thomp-
son tore Mae Baird limb from limb in a fea-
ture described on the programme as a society
cabaret dance, and Charles Brookes per-
formed miraculous gymnastic feats and in-
credible genuflections which the impeccable
programme also described as dances. Lights
were very curiously juggled to convert Maude
Fane and the industrious chorus from a
Louis Quatorze assemblage of gallants and
ladies into a collection of negro plantation
workers and then into a concourse of some
other sorts of people, unidentified; and Fred-
erick Mackay and attendant coryphees
danced a faun dance which was charming,
but perfectly incomprehensible to this unin-
telligent critic. In between, the story, which
had something to do with the love of Miss
Fane for William Senior and the determina-
tion of Harry Wootton as her father
to make her marry someone else, struggled
for expression with the same degree of suc-
cess as attends the efforts of the Murrum-
bidgee, in a season of excessive drought, to
reach the sea. One of the bright spots in an
evening full of crackers, soaring rockets and
whirling Catherine-wheels was Reita Nugent
as the odd girl out in the game of love.

Judged by Sydney Playbox standards “The

mild. Also, the constant references to the
grievances of the Emerald Isle have lost
much of their point now that the Irish Free
State has been established, although the poli-
tical intrigues still retain a topical interest
for Sydney City Council ratepayers. Yet it
contains an abundance of good fun, and the
spectacle of an audience of professed “ex-
pressionists” laughing at .the buffoonery of
somewhat obvious stage-Irish characters is,
in a way, a proof of the merit of the proven-
der, and a proof, too, that “expressionists”
are human, after all. The adaptable Duncan
Macdougall displayed an hitherto hidden
flair for comedy, and Wynne Whear-Roberts

tious Lady Mayoress. Gaffney, the loquacious

Melbourne, which last saw in Bennison a
great lover who had graduated in some
iffy s ter ions way from American cowboy to
great opera singer with an Italian alias, was
reintroduced to “The Great Lover” at the Mel-
bourne King’s on Saturday night, in much
better circumstances. Maurice Moscovitch,
as the egoistic Jean Paurel, gave realism
to the baritone’s temperamental qualities, his
supreme self-conceit and his selfishness; and
the atmosphere of temperamental storms in
the office of the manager of the Gotham
Opera House, New York, and, later, in the
dressing-room of the great Paurel was well
created. The story concerns the meeting in
one company of Giulia Sabattini, Italian
prima donna, and Paurel, who were lovers
until the growing fame of the baritone, rival-
ling her own, led to jealousy and quarrels;
since their parting Paurel has loved largely
and frequently, and the pair have hated one
another. Paurel becomes infatuated with
Ethel Warren, a young lyric soprano, and
helps her progress on the opera stage, as
well as giving her lessons in her art, but
finds her love given to Carlo Sonino, his un-
derstudy, of whom he has an additional
reason for jealousy in the knowledge that,
whilst his own day is waning, the youngster
has a splendid voice and all his life ahead of
him. Ethel Warren, having some embryo
temperament herself, engages herself to the
elderly baritone in a fit of resentment at
the reproaches of Sonino (a part sincerely
played by Nat Madison) ; and the loss of
his voice, which enables the understudy to
make a great success, binds her to her im-
pulsive promise, even though she knows the
marriage will be a loveless one. But when
Bianca Sonino, whom Paurel sincerely loved
until by trickery Sabattini got her out of
the way, comes to the now voiceless bari-
tone to plead for Carlo Sonino and tell him
that the man who has deposed him is his own
son, he makes a sacrifice and gives Ethel
Warren’s love to where it belongs.

the old trick of standing back to audience
whilst some singer off-stage sang for her;
and for the purposes of the play the voice
had to be accepted as the great one every
character on the stage declared it to-be.
Eileen Sparks doubled one of the minor
opera-people with the role of Bianca Sonino,
in which, although she showed none of the
signs of wear and care that might have been
expected, she was pathetically appealing:
the useful G. Kay Souper was a wearied
Opera House manager, who has gof used to
treating the people he has to handle as one
does children; Marie Eaton lived up to repu-
tation as the temperamental Giulia? Sabat-
tiui; and Arthur Greenaway did well as
Potter, Paurel’s valet. George Blunt, was
the Italian conductor, Maestro Ceroalo, but
nobody could think for a moment that either
he or his outbursts were Italian. Some of
the others were stiff, but Charles Hawthorne
was responsible for a good study of Ward,
the press-agent; and it was, generally, a
very well-balanced production.

There was more mystery than meat in
“The Revelations of a Wife” at the New
Palace Theatre (Melbourne) on Saturday
night; it: seems a pity that, instead of going
to America to get quick-lunch “eats,” the
promoters of the melodramatic enterprise
had not gone to Britain for good beef. Beef
should be the basis of “bellow” ; and the New
Palace show lacks substance. In a cast which
called for only seven characters (who all
did what was required of them fairly ad-
equately, although what was required was
inadequate) Jefferson Taite stood out. defi-
nitely as a real villain only towards the
end. Then it was revealed that he was
mainly responsible for most of the mysteri-
ous happenings in the house where the action
of the play runs, and that he is a villain
dyed in several aliases, a murder, some super-
fluous marriages, a robbery or two and a
number of minor infamies. But he having
altogether overdone the villainy business, the
two ladies who had gone through the form
of marriage with him are able to unite hap-
pily, one with a former husband she had
thought dead, the other with the comedy-
merchant, Frank Neil, who had very poor
comedy to peddle. Maurice Tuohy as Grant
Stirling made a manly hero, with Jessie
Page as a distracted wife faced by appari-
tions from her past. Lily Molloy made
nearly all that could be made of the soubrette
part of Kitty Constance; Marion Willis’s
Prudence Melford was too farcical, but
Betterton Glover was quite good as her
sister, Prudence.
Melbourne has seldom been more pleased
with an entertainment than it is with the
show which Edna Thomas and her two
assistants have been giving at the Athenaeum,
alternating matinees with night perform-
ances ; and, belying all theatrical experiences,
the audiences have “built up” from a moder-
ate start to full houses. At the matinees
there are special items for children, charm-
ing enough to lure youngsters whose hair is
white. Whether Edna Thomas is releasing
Brer Rabbit stories or announcing “De
Lo-ard is Gwine to Set Dis World on Fi-er.”
there is delight in what she does. Miss Con-
stance Piper is an entirely satisfactory
accompanist; and Lucille Lawrence’s harp
items fit in neatly. Performances to-night
and to-morrow must end a season extended
longer than intended; G. P. Hanna’s “Dig-
gers” entertainment is billed for Saturday.

Adelaide has been disproving the proverb
about lack of honor in one’s own country by
the reception given at the Royal to ‘‘knap,
the music of which is by Ken Duffield, or the
South Aus. squatting family. It is a bright
show, varying from cynical “ sketches well
acted to the brisk team-work of the 10 young
Australian girls who, incidentally, wear less,
from the waist down, than any team previ-
ously seen in this city. The singing is unusu-
ally good : Howett Worster and Kitty Keidy
see to that. tit. Clair and Cannot are hard-
working and sometimes funny, but xvonne
Banvard somehow just fails to “get there
—except when she dances. More clever Aus-
tralians, but younger, are the “XI VV onders
at the Majestic, where also Nat Phillips pur-
sues his now lonely course,_ and Harrington
Reynolds monologues effectively.
Melbourne's Art Blossoming:—
There are a number of notable absentees from the
Australian Art Association’s exhibition opened at the
Athenseum Hall last Thursday; and the lively “Lady
in Black” of George Bell, the “Tom Luxton” of
W. B. Melnnes and a portrait of a boy in riding
breeches showing the artist’s good work without
much enterprise, and the “Mystic Lake” of Arthur
Streeton are those artists’ only exhibits. Streeton s
picture is well conceived —trees in the foreground
touched by the light of sunset, while mists settle
on the distant lake.
There is some good work, but most of it is not
good. The portrait of J. S. Macdonald by Charles
Wheeler shows virility; and his “Late Summer” is
pleasing. Six by James R. Jackson maintain the
best average; “Sydney Harbor from Seaforth” is
the most ambitious, but “Low Tide” is the most
likeable. The unequal H. B. Harrison has gowned
and surrounded with exquisite care a lady who is
charming enough to have had more care taken with her
complexion; and he has added to his ill-treatment
by giving her glass eyes. Amongst the work by
Dora L. Wilson is a lively “Portrait of a Man"
and one of a nice child, “Pat.” One feels at first
that the charming infant should be given something
for its unhealthy color, but afterwards forgives all
for its happy smile. Norman G. C. Garter has a
“Nude Study” which solves the mystery of what a
Highlander should wear—kilt and plaid are on the
floor, and the nearly-removed tunic leaves the strenu-
ous well-drawn body naked to the gaze. There is
good perspective and air in two pictures labelled “A
Bit of Old Sydney”; but the “Portrait in Black”
lacks finish. A heavy but well-worked “Portrait”
and a charming “Road to Eltliam” are the best of
Miss Jo Sweatman’s; Miss Bale provides, in “Chry-
santhemums,” a good sample of her skill with
flowers, but is stodgy in a portrait and a landscape;
A. E. Newbury succeeds best with two misty views,
“Autumn Evening” and “Winter Mists.” W. D.
Knox has several conscientious but ordinary sketches ;
and there are a batch of rather attractive water-colors
bj r J. R. Eldersliaw. Louis McCubbin in his big
canvas, “H.M.’s Ships Hood and Repulse at Port Mel-
bourne,” has sent (l) a large packing-case fitted
with a funnel and (2) a sailing-boat which fails to
touch the water to meet the big vessels —a pity,
since the painting is spacious and has good atmo-
sphere.
There is little suggestion of wind in Carl Hampel’s
“Breezy Morning in the Mallee, Springtime,” which is
as verdant as the greenest of spring poets; and
his “View of Sydney Harbor” is a daub; but “Zinnias
and Papier-mache” shows fine work. Once you
realise that it is really a picture, and get the right
angle, John D. Moore’s “Scrub, and Rocks” is good ;
but Leslie Wilkie’s lot are disappointing. Some-
thing really nice might have been made of Mary
Allen’s “The Yellow Jacket” ; but Miss Allen might
cither finish the job herself or get a dressmaker on
to that mass of yellow. Of two by J. J. Ililder, not
up to his best, “A Country Road” has been purchased
by the Felton Trustees for the National Gallery, a
fate shared by an etching, “The Blacksmith’s Shop,”
by Sydney Ure Smith. Other exhibitors include
Thea Proctor (three quaint designs), Margaret
Preston (her “Gum Blossom” very charming), and
Harold B. Herbert (his only one, “The Tweed Valley,”
is the usual good work) ; and, showing as invitees,
Miss Vida Lahey, who only just fails in an ambitious
attempt to catch a burst of sunshine on a heavy
day in her “A Valley in Tasmania” ; G. C. Benson
with an alluring “Quiet Stream” ; and John Rowell,
whose “Morning Light” is virile.

At the Queen’s Hall, R. E. Taylor-Gliee has an
inspiring little show in which he exhibits sound
craftsmanship and good color sense. One likes him
best when he takes you to the edge of a steep
declivity and bids you look out through the trees at
earth’s far distances as in “Healesville Ranges from
Olinda” and a number of others.
At the studio of Margaret McLean, Collins-street,
is shown a mixed display of water-colors; a modest
offering with some very good work amongst it.
George Benson has a pleasing “Grey Day,” W. N.
Whitney “Summer Sunshine, Sydney,” Harold Herbert
“A Branch of the Goulburn,” and Blamire Young
several, of which a picture of a hillside upon which
the early sunshine is just creeping is best. A
crayon drawing, “Stormy Day, Richmond,” by Cum-
brae Stewart, is masterful.
An exhibition of students’ work at the Working-
men’s College gives an index of the wide range of
this institution. The most interesting exhibit is a
clay model of the head of Nicolo by Donatelli, done
by a student named W. H. Scott. The handling of
his subject makes him worth watching.

“The Ghost”: Rose Edouin (Mrs. G. B.
W. Lewis), just dead in England, made her
first Australian appearance at the Cremorne
Garden Theatre in Mel-
bourne. She was then only
12, yet had already made
appearances in England with
G. V. Brooke. Two years be-
fore her coming the man
who was to become her hus-
band had opened Ast ley's
Amphitheatre, which, much
altered and subsequently re-
built, became the Princess
Theatre; and after their
marriage he was lessee of
the old Bijou for many
years. In her 77tli year she
made her last stage appear-
ance, at the London Savoy,
playing Mrs. Putter in
“Paddy the Next Bbst
Thing”—that was in 1920.
“Flaming Youth’’: The
opportunity of which the
undei’study dreams came in
Melbourne the other day for
two bright Australians who
have stood by in numerous
productions. Polly Power
got her chance when Elsie
Prince caught a cold; and
Polly was a very bright
Nanette for several nights.
Floie Allan, the _ other girl,
passed from musical comedy
to a straight speaking part
which is one of the best
things in “Within the Law.”
Floie’s stage career _ had an
inauspicious beginning. _ At
nine years of age. she joined
a juvenile co. which went to
India and stranded there.
Kindly Anglo-Indians sal-
vaged the wreck, and the
youngsters were sent back
to their own country.
“D.E.”: Bose Edouin made her first
appearance on the stage as the child in “The
Stranger” with G. Y. Brooke. That was on
September 19, 1851, and she outlived the
great Brooke 59 years. In her girlhood she
must have played before grey-whiskered war-
riors who had fought at Trafalgar and
Waterloo; in her old age she delighted Dig-
gers from Australia and Maori land, veterans
of Lone Pine and Mont St. Quentin. In
the course of 70 years Mrs. Lewis appeared
with Samuel Phelps, Joseph Jefferson, Wil-
liam Creswick, Tree and Benson, playing
Beatrice, Portia, Lady Teazle, Mrs. Candour,
the Nurse in “Borneo and Juliet,” the Host-
ess in “Henry V.,” Mrs. Quickly in “The
Merry Wives” and a hundred other parts,
including Hamlet. Her husband, who was
her manager for many years, predeceased her.
“T. 0.1.”: How many now living remember
the Edouin troupe of juvenile comedians?
Five of them there were, Charles. Willie,
John, Bose and Julia; and when they first
appeared at the Adelaide Gallery, London,
they were billed as the Living Marionettes.
In 1856 they came to Australia and put in
a season at the Theatre Boyal, Melbourne,
just then built by John Black. I first saw
them at the theatre in Cremorne Gardens,
after G. V. Brooke and George Coppin had
dissolved partnership. After touring the
goldfields they settled in Melbourne, lhe
father—real name, Jones —kept livery stables
in Gertrude-street, _ Fitzroy; the mother
always travelled with the family. G. L.
W. Lewis took the brood, now grown up, to
India; there Lewis married Rose, Charles
married Lizzie Naylor, John married Tilly
Earl, all of the stage, and Julia married a
Chinese mandarin. Rose was, I believe, the
last survivor of that juvenile troupe.
“Hamfat”: John Cosgrove (B. 20/8/'25)
had one venture into grand opera, but not
as an actor. While precariously leasing an
Adelaide playhouse, he arranged for an opera
season with an Italian crowd which had
arrived on its uppers; and, without consult-
ing the other party to the contract, billed a
change of piece for each night. The Italians
protested excitedly that it couldn’t be done ;
but John told them sternly that they would
have to obey order's in his theatre. On the
third night the performers got themselves
hopelessly tangled in the unrehearsed piece.
Their manager desperately walked to the
footlights to try to explain to the restless
audience that it was all Cosgrove’s fault; but
John made a duet of it with an explanation
of his own. It was mainly to the effect that
he was washing his hands of the Italians, and
that those who had been disappointed in not
hearing “Lucia” could get tickets at the door
for “Fun on the Bristol” next night—they
would find it, as played by his own company,
a much better show. Someone from the
audience demanded his money back. “I hear
a voice,” Cosgrove thundered. “Let the con-
temptibly mean person who, ignoring my
offer, demands his paltry dross, come down
to the front so that I may give it to him.
Ah, here lie is, ladies and gentlemen! Look
well at him!” After further remarks in this
vein, he threw some threepenny bits towards
the miserable wretch, who, without waiting
to gather them up, slunk away. “Now,
gentlemen,” John proceeded, “are there any

“I see you've got me down for four songs. Do you think
my turn would he letter if I omitted one of them?”
“Yes, laddie, yes! Twenty-five per cent, letter .”
others in this audience who want their money
returned?” There were not. The idea of
getting a relative to act as a deterrent to
others by facing that torrent of abuse was a
stroke of genius.
“Goldilocks”: My assistance having been
asked by a newly-arrived producer who was
considering a local venture, I took him to
an Old Hand, thinking that he might know
some bright young actress I had possibly
overlooked. The producer explained liis posi-
tion ; could the old ’un call to mind a saucy
soubrette in the making, a girl who, given
proper training, might become a winner ?
“Betty Jones!” exclaimed the ancient enthu-
siastically. “I always said that girl only
needed to be taken in hand to become one of
the greatest soubrettes in the business. Bonzer
little girl, Betty! Sprightly, shapely, good
speaking voice, boshter little soprano, and
brains, sir, brains!” His enthusiasm fired
the producer, who demanded to know where
he could find the treasure. “Find her?” said
the Old Hand slowly. “You can't. She died
20 years ago.”
“C.K.”: When writing his operas W. S.
Gilbert generally knew who would perform
the most important parts, and wrote them to
fit. The Savoy company was m many re-
spects permanent, and any recruit received
approval from Gilbert and Sullivan before
being engaged by D’Oyly Carte. Several per-
formers played in only one opera, notably
Henry Bracy in “Princess Ida,” and Frank
Wyatt in “Gondoliers.” Bracy was engaged
for Hilarion as a contrast to Durward Lely,
and Wyatt was chosen for Plaza Toro be-
cause. in addition to being an excellent “high
comedy” actor, he was an exceptional dancer.
In “His Excellency,” however (the book was
complete before the quarrel with Sullivan
occurred), Gilbert had not the Savoy co., as
a co., to rely on, but he secured as many past
or present members of it as possible—Gros-
smith, Barrington, Jessie Bond, Nancy Mcln-
tosh and myself. When Gilbert read the book
to us, we saw instantly that the important
part of Dame Cortlandt had been written for
Alice Barnett, the statuesque Fairy Queen
of “lolanthe.” Unfortunately George Ed-
wardes, under whose management of the.
Lyric the opera was produced, had quarrelled
with Alice, and declined to engage her. He
selected Aida Jenoure, who had made a suc-
cess in “The Mountebanks.” This clever
little lady was obviously physically unfitted
for the part, and after a few rehearsals re-
linquished it. Edwardes wouldn’t give in.
lie engaged Alice Aynsley Cooke, a fine and
experienced performer, but it was no use.
After a few tries she also retired. So Ed-
wardes had to agree to Alice Barnett, and the
lady who saw “no objection to stoutness, in
moderation” played the part and made a hit.
Dear Betxetix, —“Val D.” (B. 20/8/’25)
is right: I was not in the first production
of “Pinafore” in Australia. As a youngster
I saw the name blazoned on the hoai’dings
outside the School of Arts, Sydney. Later,
at the Queen’s Theatre, York-street, I wit-
nessed a production for which Kelly and
Leon were responsible. Leon, who was a
female impersonator and had then done his
dash, played Buttercup as a pretty girl
fashionably dressed; he interpolated a song
of the euckoo in the second act. introducing
it with a barbarous gag. I was just on 27
when I played Dick Deadeye in an excellent
cast at Her Majesty's: Wallace Brownlow
as Corcoran, George Lauri as Sir Joseph.
Pat Bathurst as the Boatswain, Jennie Opie
as Buttercup, and Carrie Moore as Josephine
—in Brisbane Ada Winston Weir W'as Jose-
phine. I left the co. at the end of my
twelve-months’ engagement, which was for
principal parts and to understudy (very com-
prehensive those two departments proved),
and set out for England. How tempos
fugits !—Yours, W. B. Beattie.
“Satis”: It is unfortunately a fact that
Harrison Owen’s comedy “The Gentleman-in-
Waiting” (B. 27/8/’25) “did not quite hit
the bull’s-eye” at the London Comedy
Theatre. To tell the truth, it was snuffed out
in a fortnight, having only a little less luck
than Dale Collins’s “Ordeal.” Still it is a
feather in the cap of each young Australian
writer to have got a piece produced on the
London boards so early in his career as
playwright. The interesting pair would have
had to wait till Doomsday in their native
country for managers to take them by the
hand. This is the Never-Never Land all
right for aspiring dramatic authors.
“C. Ocknoy”: Some of the old brigade of
English dramatists are starting to kick
against the Americanising of the London
stage. When the last mail left there were
10 plays from the U.S.A. on view in the
West End. In these circumstances a good
deal of sympathy will be felt for R. C.
Carton, who seemingly cannot get a look-in
nowadays. Says the author of “Lord and
Lady Algy” and a score of such bright and
breezy comedies: : —
It is a very serious thing for the average drama-
tist, whose only chance is to edge in his play
between the American play which is just coming
off and the other American play which is just going on.
One of the Schuberts, of the big N’York
firm, has taken what lie calls an "interest"
in six London theatres.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : MeCathie’s, in Pitt-street,
Sydney, has another association with the
stage than that of standing upon the site
of the old Victoria Theatre; actor Bert.
Bailey is a son of tlie Mrs. McOathie who
made the business. And it still yields Her-
bert dividends on which he could live quite
comfortably bad ho not amassed a nice for-
tune on his own account out of stage ven-
tures, principally “On Our Selection.”
“Harnfat”: Cotton, who was director of
the Lee White show, and is now proposing
a venture on his own account, had an experi-
ence in England witli a new play which
Hopped in the first act. The audience waited
grimly till the final curtain; then there were
fierce cries of “Author! Author!” The
scared playwright shrank back in the box.
refusing to show himself, and, as the crowd
became riotous, Cotton was pushed on to
explain that the author had drowned hDwelt'
or something. A tornado blew down from
all sides as he appeared, but lulled when he
began to speak. “Ladies and gentlemen,”
he said, “do not misjudge me. I am not
the author.” The rest of the speech was
drowned in laughter, and the audience, now
appeased, went home.
A BAD BREAK.

The Film Combated
Why not keep those prettier teeth ?
Your dentist, when he cleans teeth,
removes the dingy film. Then teeth
look whiter, cleaner. Why not keep
them so ?
Millions of people now daily fight
that film. They use a new type tooth
paste.
How teeth lose their beauty
You feel on your teeth a viscous
film. Under old-way brushing, much
of it clings and stays. Food stains, etc.,
discolour it, then it forms dingy coats
to cloud the lustre of the teeth.
T F 1” also causes most tooth troubles.
It holds food substance which ferments
and forms acid. Germs breed by mil-
lions in it. They, with tartar, are the
chief cause of pyorrhea.
Modern science has discovered two
ways to fight that film. One disin-
tegrates the film at all stages of forma-
tion. One -moves it without harmful
scouring. 1
Many careful tests have proved these
methods effective, A new-type tooth
paste has been created to apply them
daily. The name is Pepsodent.
Ten days shows what
it means
This delightful test will quickly
show you what Pepsodent can do.
Pepsodent more than fights film. It
multiplies the alkalinity of the saliva
That is there to neutralize the mouth
acids. It multiplies the ptyalin in
saliva, which is there to digest starch
deposits on teeth.

After 33 Years!
Treatment of Loyal Policy-holders
Triumph of Success.
THE CITY MUTUAL LIFE OFFICE announced some few months ago that it had a
surplus over liabilities (calculated actuarially as if the future value of interest was
3\ per cent.) of more than half a million.
In order to conserve the present magnificent bonuses in the interests of the P°h c Y"
holders, the Directors gave a commission to Mr. E. S. Wolfenden, A.1.A., or this ci y, e
well-known Actuary, to thoroughly go into its records, examine the source of profit, and
advise generally.
One of the first things, however, which the Directors decided to do was to give a thought
to the old Policy-holders who had loyally stood by the Society in its earlier years, and it
was decided to cancel all future premiums on Policies in force 35 years, on the attainmen
by each member of the age of 80 years.
This, so far as the management knows, is the first time in the history of the world’s life
assurance that such a step has been taken. One institution in Australia, it is stated,
will pay the amount of the policy money when the assured attains the age of SO
(or 195, we are not sure which), but with that exception nothing appears to have
been done of a nature similar to the action adopted now by the Directors of the
City Mutual.
There are in force a fairly large number of these members, and intimation has been
sent out to them of the pleasing fact that no further premiums will be payable on the
Policy, but that the magnificent bonuses already being paid will continue.
A facsimile of one of the replies is printed on this page. For a man of over 80 the
writing and signature are, it will be noticed, quite legible. But alongside is written in
ordinary type, the wording of the letter in question.
This was
underlined
in your
circular.

George Crowley, Esq.,
Managing Director,
City Mutual L.A.S., Ltd.
Dear Sir,—
I have yours of 19th inst., and have
to thank your good self and your co-
directors for your liberal intimation
that no further premiums will be pay-
able upon my policy, and that I will
still participate in the profits, and 1
feel pleased to think that I have even
in a very infinitesimal quantity assisted
you in carrying out your policy, such
advice as issued by you in May, 1892
(which is now before me), and it is
doubly pleasing to know that you have
carried out that policy to the letter and
that your prophetic statement has come
true that it ivill be equal if not better
than any other Society in the world.
Yours very faithfully,
G. W. Phillips.

Deliciousness? Yes. All say so I guess,
Who call.
You’re a Niceness and a Quickness,
A Laughingness and a Sweetness,
But sometimes, p’raps, a Naughtyness.
Now, ’fess!—
... .Francis TANARUS.; Very rugged verse ; and the language
has no resemblance to Australian A.N.F.: The
lines don’t carry it G.E.D.: Too thin
W.W.L.S.; “The Unknown Quality” has only a far-
off interest Mary TANARUS.: Doesn’t make a yam
J.A.V.S. : Very thin stuff with no point H.R.M.:
The gentleman who played the cannibal isn’t thrilling.
M.G. (Bendigo); Not stirring enough. .. .Ah Sin:
The verse hasn’t the skill to carry it Y.H.C.: The
material for a yarn is there, but the telling doesn’t
convince... .M.H.H.; The pub buyer hasn’t much in-
terest Clergyman: Doesn’t amount to a reply, and
brings forward no real argument... .N.E.R.: The mix-
ture of poet, hawker and thief is not made convincing
by the mere fact that he has a curious hiding-place
for his booty A.M.8.8.: No good R.F.N.:
Yarns of that pattern could be invented by the gross,
but they want some characterisation or color to carry
them.... Chalk: The points on which it turns are too
disgusting E.A.A.: Don’t care for the “Arab”
Bellerive: “The Burning Ship” is strong and vivid:—
Apprehension prevailed among
The passengers and crew.
The critical moments arrived.
A ghastly scene did ensue.
Smoke and fierce flames
From the main hatchway arose,
Only the mercy, of the
Lord could interpose.
“Launch the boats,’’ the
Firm captain did roar;
“There’s a chance for a
Number to reach the shore.”
As burning fragments' shot
Their lurid sparks around,
Victims leaped overboard
And were quickly drown’d.
Bleeding and gashed
From the Lascars’ knives,
Brave Europeans fought
Like wolves for their lives.
When silent night reigned,
And clear shone the stars
Upon the waves floated
Big smouldering spars.
....Rex B.: The “Blind” misses .Lucifer: The
verse is not bad of its sort, but the yarn is too
flimsy 0.F.H.; Woodden verse that Says only the
obvious things Pussy-Willow: Weak little flutter.
... .W.M.L.: The sonnet has the right shape, but
nothing else to recommend it. The other verse
fails. There are rules at the end of any good book
on grammar, but the only guide is the reading of
good verse... .A.H.S.: Tedious and unconvincing....
J.8.W.: Sentimental commonplace poorly written....
Jay Pen: Ragged. —John M.: The verse doesn’t
carry it Dad: The old things in a metre that
wallows along under the 1 whip.... L.R.W.: Itfs
pretty hard on Australia to have things like that
thrown at her... .E.R.8.: No use writing about no-
thing, .. .E.D. (Perth): “The Balcony” is too slight.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
H.W.B.: They look like rubbings from an aboriginal
rock-carving.. . .J.K.; Your comic invertebrates
don’t appeal... .T.H.: The pen-work is smart, but
smart penwork alone won’t make a humorous illustra-
tion B.H. : Can recommend you with confidence to

Bad Weather doesn’t matter now!
Before this family owned a Ford Car,
a rainy day often meant staying at
home —even from school.
Now mother’s Ford is always avail-
able, and she prefers to drive it,
confident of its reliable performance,
ease of parking, garaging and driving.
Ford economy is a decided advantage.
The car is not only low in price, but
it is economical in operation, and it
requires but little care to keep it in
first-class running order. These
features make a special appeal to the
woman who requires that her car shall
render the maximum of useful service
at a minimum expenditure of trouble,
time or money.

“Hamer” : If the Yankee sailors took away
any colds from Melbourne they will be able
to treat them with a real Australian remedy.
Just before the Fleet left, Australia’s largest
firm of eucalyptus-distillers handed over a
consignment of small bottles, one for each
man in the Fleet, with a special decanter
for Admiral Coontz.
# * * *
“Sturt”: The Bengelley factory at Ed-
wardstown (S.A.), said to be the largest
furniture-making concern in Australia —it
handles tramcar bodies and such things as
well —-is to have a rival close by. E. M.
Mathias, formerly of Tasmania but for 30
years manager at Pengelley’s, will be the
head of a co. with a capital of £lOO,OOO. A
Port Adelaide concern has been taken over
and moved there, and Grundy, a Melbourne
timber merchant, brings some Vic. capital
and enthusiasm into the venture.
* * * *
“Saaedi” : This year has seen high prices
again ruling for rabbit-skins, and it has been
possible for skilled trappers to make as much
as £l5 per week. In recent times the rabbit
has become an important asset. Off 150
acres I have destroyed during the past 12
months 3000 rabbits. Many of these were
young ones. Had they all been permitted
to reach maturity the value of their skins, at
the average price paid over the period, would
have been £7O at least. It is doubtful if
an equal amount could be made out of sheep
on the same area in the same time.
* * * *
“ Jacky Roo”: Despite the uncertainty of
the wool market, the man on the land in
N.S.W. is having a pretty good time this
year. Sheep prices are higher than the
price of wool should allow; and some big
mobs are changing hands. Rain has been
plentiful very nearly all over the State,
and feed is abundant. And the autumn
and winter lambing will show an average of
68 per cent., the highest since 1911. There
are 19,705,000 ewes in N.S.W., of which
12,021,000 were mated; and the probable
markings are 8.222,000—800,000 more than
in the previous season.

“Jesmond” : Our bush lawyer had been a
nuisance for months, and I got fed up with
him while compiling taxation returns. I
found scores of receipts with carefully can-
celled postage stamps; the holders invariably
explained that Buzfuz said that the latter
would do if duty-stamps were not available.
I sought Buzfuz and told him that it was my
duty to report all cases of unstamped re-
ceipts which I found, and that postage-
stamped receipts were, in law, unstamped.
I further pointed out that, by posing as a
legal adviser, he was liable for all manner of
penalties. The probable fines. I thought,
would come to about £2OO. Two days later
our Bush lawyer left to go trapping up north.
* * * *
“Naklioda”: The whirligig of time returns
Ilerr Burggraf, general representative of the
Scientific Electric Survey Corporation of
Germany, who comes back without malice
in his heart to sell the country that interned
and then deported him a device for finding
our hidden stores of gold, silver and oil.
The method is claimed to be entirely new.
It consists in charging up the earth to a
high potential and measuring its resistance.
As the various metals offer different degrees
of resistance to the passage of an electric
current, the presence of precious substances,
it is claimed, can be detected. If the results
are as claimed the wild cat will become a
depressed and broken-spirited animal.
* * * *
“Larrapinta” : How is it that the Norfolk
Island pine is omitted from our re-afforesta-
tion programmes? It can't be from lack of
strength, as the graceful tree grows as
straight as a gun-barrel along the sea coast,
where the prevailing wind twists and dis-
torts every other vegetable, native or foreign.
It grows also on the poorest soil, with its
roots almost washed by the sea. Its growth
is sufficiently rapid, a 60-year-old Norfolk
Islander being straight and tall enough to
make a mast for an old-time clipper ship.
If these trees were planted closely, in order
to minimise knots, they should run the im-
ported insignis a close second for rapidity of
growth, and the timber would be quite equal
to that of a lot of the Oregon and spruce we
now import.

“Clerk": A few weeks ago The Bulletin
condemned the too-prevalent practice in the
Vic. railways of compelling engine-drivers to
work long hours of overtime. Startled by a
recent case in which a blasphemous train-
crew had been blocked for 176 minutes, and
another where a goods train was delayed for
seven hours on one trip, Commissioner Clapp
snatched a minute from slogan-making to
write a memo directing attention “to the
number of excessive shifts worked by train-
crews.” Station staffs were vaguely asked
to “obviate delays to goods trains,” and there
the matter rests. There is an uneasy feel-
ing that if drastic remedies of this sort are
permitted, Clapp will soon be sweeping away
the congestion at the Flinders-street bar-
riers by telling the ticket-nippers to let the
crowds through more quickly.
GET TO THE ROOT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Yankee inventors are working feverishly on syn-
thetic fuel, for motor-cars.”
These guys are off the proper line,
To no effect they’re hasting;
If they would help the skinny kine,
Their persp. and time they’re wasting.
To blazes with synthetic juice!
’Twon’t lift our load oppressing—•
My T.P. bus goes well in use;
’Tain’t that that’s got me guessing.
There’s something better they can do
If set on cute inventions,
And, bringing joy to not a few,
Achieve their best intentions.
If they’d grow rich and cut a dash
In benefactors’ raiments,
They’ll just invent synthetic cash
To meet the monthly payments!

“Jim Carew”: Newchum’s luck. I know
a “migrant” who stepped into a job the
day after lie landed. With his first pay he
sent to Tasmania for a Tatt.’s ticket and
drew first prize. He immediately bought
into a going business, and has sent ’Omc
for the rest of the family.
“Tarago”: What is the longest stretch a
Digger went without leave overseas? I went
just over 12 months, and after the war was
surprised to receive a cheque for £9-odd, re-
presenting 3s. per day sustenance money for
leave I should have had but didn’t. I won-
der how many Diggers, with no permanent
address, missed their sustenance money?
“G.S.”: Not thinking that a nugget of
osmiridium large enough to be picked up
with a sluice-fork existed, a digger at Bald
Hill (Tas.) carelessly forked the coarse piece
of rubble, as he thought it to be, from his box.
Weeks later Tom Prouse came along and
noticed a “speck” amongst the rubbish. The
“speck,” when weighed, proved to be the
weightiest osmiridium nugget in the world—
just over 4oz.
“Panchaz”: The first Anniversary Day
dinner in N. S. Wales of which record sur-
vives took place in 1817, in a place that
served as a post office, where the George-
street North fire-station now stands. The
moving spirit was Isaac Nicholls, the post-
master of the period. He invited between
40 and 50 guests to the feed, which was evi-
dently a long-distance event, as it took
five hours to get through the musical items
and toasts.
A strange fatality ocurred at Plympton.
an Adelaide suburb. Electric wires, were
being stretched afresh on the Bay-roajd,
when a new one unaccountably broke. Lines
got tangled, fuses blew out in neighboring
houses, and sparks flew from electric-irons
in use. Yet there was more alarm than
damage or danger in every case but one; a
woman resident ran out of her house to
see to the safety of her daughter, and,
somehow carelessly taking hold of an ordi-
nary wire fence, fell dead.
“Calcite”; Some score of years ago, when
working in the Midland Railway yards of
W.A., I recognised an old acquaintance in
a loco, that had come in for repairs.
It was the old Silver King, the first
engine to steam into Silverton and Broken
Hill. Originally it had belonged to Baxter
and Saddler, the railway contractors, and
years afterwards had been bought by the
W.A. Government to help shift a block of
goods at Fremantle. I couldn’t help regret-
ting that I was too poor to make a bid even
for the nameplate as a souvenir of early
days at the Barrier.
“Glenal”: Converting themselves into a
working bee, the Baptists of Auburn (Syd.)
recently built a new church in a shade
under hours. But that was beaten on
October 11, 1911, by the hardshells of the
adjoining centre of Sefton Park. Ten hours
after starting time they had run up, on what
had previously been tea-tree scrub, a taber-
nacle measuring 30ft. x 20ft. and 14ft. from
floor to ceiling, lined with panels and steel
and with centre hanging-lamps. A pulpit
and organ were also installed, enabling a
short dedicatory service to be held the same
evening. The total cost of this outfit was
a little under £llO.
“Ted”: Touching varied occupations (B.
13/8/’25). I know a man, now 42, who began
earning his living at 16 in a barber’s shop.
After a spell in a pie-shop and another in
a grocery, he was an insurance agent at 17.
Then he took up mining and put in two years
studying at a school of mines. His next job
was advance agent, then theatrical manager,
next union secretary, strike-leader and un-
successful candidate for Parliament. The
war took him away for four years; he re-
turned to become (1) auctioneer, (2) draper,
(3) stationer. Since then he has been politi-
cal organiser, painter, country reporter,
billiard-marker (in three States) and book-
maker’s clerk; he is now a commission agent.
He goes quarrying next week, and I’m going
too. In fact, I’m he.
“Jaques”: Ever since Melbourne permitted
cable-trams to run through its main thor-
oughfares it has been suffering from conges-
tion at the cross roads, and as the Yarra
city is all cross roads, the congestion is all
the more marked. Melbourne claims that
Flinders-street crossing at “peak” periods
(i.e., between 5 and 6 p.m.) is the busiest
crossing in the world; personally, I doubt
if it compares even with Sydney’s Railway-
square. Many and varied are the remedial
schemes, but the best way to ease the strain
would be to eliminate the cable-trams alto-
gether from the heart of the city. Melbourne
is no great size when all’s said and done, and
even with its wide thoroughfares it cannot,
by reason of its chessboard design, afford to
run cable-trams in every street. Sydneyites
can guess what fun the traffic-cops would
have if trams were run up Bathurst-street,
Park-street, Market-street, King-street, Mar-
tin-place, Hunter-street and Bridge-street.
That’s what Melbourne is doing, and at the
same time wondering why there’s such a
fuss at 5 o’clock.
“Caractacus” : For decades Melbourne de-
pended on N.S.W. coal for motive power and
other essentials of existence, and depended on
it so entirely that its industrial activities and
social comfort stopped short on the numerous
occasions when the miners went on strike.
The State then decided on electricity of its
own production from its own raw material as
the saviour. It has gone nap on electricity,
and now its Robot seems inclined to turn
and rend it. A boy’s coat dropped on an
overhead cable the other day brought to a
standstill the railway services of three sub-
urbs wherein are located some 120,000 people.
A flung towel did a similar disservice an-
other time; a jambed “point” caused another
widespread dislocation. Ever and anon a small
breakage in head or relaying station pulls up
a section of the train system. In the house-
hold branch of electric service a parallel
state of uncertainty prevails. It is becoming
a commonplace for whole suburbs suddenly
to be plunged into darkness, with trams,
electric irons, kettles, baby’s feed-pots, radi-
ators and hot-plates suddenly gone cold. No
wise household is without its packet of
candles, and ancient kerosene lamps are be-
ing rescued from lumber-rooms and set aside
for emergency lighting.

Storm.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL the gales had broken bondage
/\ frenzied airs, to widely veer
With a thresh of unseen pinions-down
the sloping of the year.
Every fair and fragrant Silence, beaten to
the frighted ground,
Shuddered to the rocking thunders pealing
from the peaks of Sound ;
And the sea awoke from sleeping, till the
dumb and placid plain
Echoed to the Avilder calling, Avhitcned to the
sweeping rain.
Over to the outer places with a cloudy-
toAvered crest,
Swung the Avave of driven weather from the
sunset-weary west.
Swift the wide world rolled to meet it, fling-
ing valley, plain and height,
Where the shallows of the twilight deepened
to the tide of night;
Fled from out the arms of chaos, stooped
beneath the drooping hour,
Bearing, on the quest of morning, sobbing
tree and weeping flower;
Till the turning of the circle found a splen-
dor riding warm
Down the A’alley of the dawning, cantering
across the storm;
Till the trumpets of the daytime calling far
and ringing loud,
Chimed upon the ear of Distance, flashing on
from cloud to cloud.
Then arose the mists of Fancy from the
hushes of the mind,
Wreathing like the wistful vapors in the
calm behind the wind;
Phantom hope and vanished boyhood, other
joys in other spheres
Glimmered o’er the far horizon down the
desert of the years ;
Soon there woke a mystic cadence, fume and
hue of bruised flow r ers;
Strode the golden Youth I cherished, back-
Avard through the driving hours,
And I knew the tinselled motley, foolish
heart and prancing feet,
All the arrogance of laughter, all the boast-
ing of the street.
SAvift the searching gleam of Reason found
the face beneath the mask.
Stripped the pride of bone and sinew, took
the richer worth to task;
SaAV the flame of early vision, faint and fail
and wane away,
Like the glimmer of the dawning paling to
the broader day;
Found the shallow sham of Passion, soav
the narrow gleam of Pride;
Once again we stormed together doAvn some
vanished city-tide,
Till the golden Youth passed onward, gleam-
ing for a little space,
Leaning to the arms of Distance with a back-
ward smiling face.
It is well to swiftly banish vanished times
that gleam again,
Through the storm of teeming moments flash-
ing by like fleeting rain ;
Spurn Desire and erring Fancy; crush the
flower and turn the page,
Questing where the sun of Reason gloAvs
across the peaks of Age;
So ’tis best to stem the torrent, tread some
calmer place apart,
Take and hold the years of Manhood glowing
warmly in the heart;
For within the zones of quiet, hushed behind
the storm of Youth,
Chime the mellow tones of Wisdom, speak-
ing from the Vale of Truth.
N.S.AV.
BOYCE BOWDEN.
His Castle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MR. QUIN stared after the jaunty,
departing figure of young Fletcher.
Even the back of the man told a tale
of debonair confidence; the hat was tilted
a little to one side at such a cocksure angle,
the step was so springy, the shoulders squared
and, as it were, light-weighted. Mr. Quin
knew that his own shoulders stooped a little
too much, his feet shuffled too tiredly lor his
nearly forty years of living. But what
would’ you when your spirit Avas stooped,
your soul shuffling and tired? It had been
a trying day, and depression uoav sat heavily
on those same shoulders of his.
Why shouldn’t young Fletcher be jaunty,
junior partner as he Avas of the prosperous
and expanding business? Why shouldn’t liis
shoulders be squared and light-weighted ?
Mr. Quin sighed as he quietly shut the
drawer of his desk and rose to remove his
well-worn office coat. He hung' it on its
accustomed nail, slipped off the old-fashioned
cuff-protectors that he still wore in face of
the sneers of a smarter generation, gathered
into his neat handbag a pile of! stuff that
lie had set apart to be looked over at home,
squirmed into his outdoor coat,, neat and
clean but hardly less worn than the other,
and, with a final glance about, lijft the long
room that had known him unfailingly for
so many years of Avorking days.
He passed an early charAvomian in the
corridor outside. She looked tired and hope-
less, stooped and shuffling, thought Mr.
Quin. She had been many yearn, lie knew,
charring the offices of Fozzard and Fletcher,
hut not so many as he had been tied to one
of their desks —charring their accounts.
Sister and brother under the skin they were,
he thought. Very depressed was: Mr. Quin.
He was last to leave the lift at the ground
floor as he had been last to enter it above.
Mr. Quin usually was. On the marble steps
to the street he stood irresolute and stared
uncertainly at the hurrying croAvd?
Scores of other offices had released many
more Mr. Quins, and the homeward-scurrying
workers so filled the broad pavement that
there seemed small room for another atom
iii the swift-moving human stream. At last
he slipped quickly into an opening that came,
and, after some jostling, managed to steer
directly into the wake of two large women
who floated placidly and heavily with the
current. Though it reduced his pace more
than he wished, Mr. Quin stayed in this
comparatively safe backwater throughout the
journey to the station. Here he fell duti-
fully in the line of the long queue at the bar-
rier ; but others, less ethical, pushed past
him on both sides, and it was some time be-
fore he reached the gate. In his eagerness
to be through he dropped his ticket and
flushed miserably at the pert “Don’t hurry,
me lord; the carriage waits” of a pimply-
faced lad-porter.
A gossiping group, midway on the ramp
to the platform, all but lost him his train,
but at the last moment he managed to edge
past and made a dash for a compartment
where he spied a solitary vacant seat. He
arrived at the carriage-door one pace ahead
of a bustling, red-faced man. There was a
moment of confusion, and Mr. Quin entered
the carriage one pace behind the red-faced
man who, as he settled in the last seat,
grumbled loudly about “pushing and shov-
ing.” Mr. Quin murmured an apology. As
the train moved out lie braced himself un-
comfortably against the door and opened his
evening paper. He read something of wild
doings in China, of new labor troubles and
the beginning, of an article by a medical
authority on “Food and Fletcherism.” But
that recalled the worries of the day, and the
print misted before his eyes.
What Avas it that young Fletcher had
said? “If you’d only gone in to see old
Fuzzie” —it was thus irreverently that the
junior partner referred to Fozzard, the senior
—“l’m pretty sure you’d have got that new
branch. He expected you to. Told me so.
Of course, Jennings has the gift of the gab.
When he got in he dazzled Fuzzic with
science, and had the job out of him before
he’d recovered his eyesight. However, I
suppose you didn’t want to shift out of
town, eh?” And Mr. Quin had said, “That’s
right, Mr. Fletcher.”
He didn’t want to shift out of his rut! He
didn’t want the big salary ! Mr. Quin winced
and groaned all but audibly, and then,
catching the eye of the red-faced man upon
him, smiled in a sickly way as if at some-
thing he had just read. “That’s right, Mr.
Fletcher!” He “didn’t want to be branch-
manager,” whereas actually from the time
the possibility had even hazily appeared to
him he had been whipping and spurring him-
self in the effort to scare up the nerve to
ask for the position. Twenty years of ser-
vile clericalism had made him more than
diffident. Anything else was too good for
“poor old Quinsy,” as those over-smart
youngsters in the office called him. There
iiad grown in him a sort of sick conviction,
a soul-certainty about that. Always before,
when even minor openings presented, there
had been somebody more fitted and ready to
slip in ahead of him. Tie was used to it.
When the news of this new branch and
vacant managership was first rumored, he
had not considered that it could concern him
in any way. It was altogether beyond his
dreams. The chance talk of a friend had
first waked the wild idea. And then the
days of doubt and vaguely-stirring hope, of
self-distrust and solitary argument! It was
only to-day that he had won to the deter-
mination to try, little as he hoped—only this,
afternoon. He remembered now (it accounted
for his headache) that he hadn’t gone out
for lunch. He’d sat in the deserted office
and fought himself into it —into the feeling,
long dead, that he might be better than some
next man; into the courage to face old Foz-
zard. It might have been easier if he hadn’t
always been so almighty scared of Fozzard.
It was mid-afternoon before he finally
burned his boats, knocked at the dread door
and entered the “old man’s” room. His
palms sweated, his face was hot and his
lips trembled as he opened them to stammer
his petition. But before he could speak Foz-
zard looked up at him, and, frowning, grunted,
“Oh, Mr. Quin, tell Miss Smith to hustle
with those letters she took; I want to sign
’em straight away.” And Mr. Quin retired,
cold and cowardly-relieved. It took him a
good hour to steel himself to it again, but
at last he did. He felt thoroughly deter-
mined. He walked firmly to the door. His
hand was ‘almost steady, poised for the fate-
ful knock, when someone coming in from
the corridor with a rush hailed him.
It was Jennings, one of their smartest
travellers, breezy, resourceful, ever-grinning
Jennings.
“Hey, Quinsy, old man!” he shouted across
the office, “just a minute! Let’s slip in
first, will you? Want to see Fuzzic parti-
cular. Won’t be long.” By that time he
had crossed the room, reached for the handle
of the door and pushed in ahead of the hesi-
tating Mr. Quin. Back to his high stool
went Mr. Quin and sat down to his accus-
tomed ledgers. It was a full half-hour be-
fore Jennings came out. He slapped Mr.
Quin heavily on the narrow back.
“How's she poppin’, Quinsy, old son?”
said Jennings boisterously. “And how are
all the little abscesses? Ripe for cutting
yet? Tooraloo, you bad old man!” And
away went Jennings, breezy as ever and for-
getful of thanks for the small favor he’d
asked. Almost on his heels came the senior
partner, leaving for the night. Mr. Quin
said “Good-night, Mr. Fozzard.” and settled
more heavily on his stool. A little later his
head dropped on his hands. He was still
like that when Fletcher, on his way out,
stopped to give that final ironic twist to the
day—“.... if you’d gone in to see old
Fuzzie.... expected you t 0... . didn’t want
to shift out of town.... that’s right, Mr.
Fletcher!”
All the way out Mr. Quin held his miser-
ably precarious position against the violent
jolting and swaying of the train. It was
with a little sigh of relief that he stepped
on to the platform at his own station. Only
one other got out at this quiet suburb. It
was the red-faced man. He passed through
the ticket-gate just ahead of Mr. Quin. Mr.
Quin’s shoulders drooped and his feet shuffled

Old People’s
Kidneys
Many Elderly People Suffer
from Some Form of
Kidney Trouble
WHEN past middle age there frequently
comes a noticeable weakening of the
organs of the body, and resulting danger
of quick decline. It is quite necessary to give
prompt help to any part that first shows signs of
wear. Weak kidneys often bring constant back-
ache, lame back, stitches and twinges of pain,
annoying urinary troubles, and the danger of
serious kidney disease. Doan s Backache Kidney
Pills are gratefully recommended by many aged
people. Read these Sydney testimonies.
CONVINCING PROOF FROM
SYDNEY.
A MAN’S CASE
Mr. Frederick Bradd, Crump Street,
Mortdale, Sydney, says: “I caught a
severe cold, which settled in my kid-
neys and caused severe backache, I
suffered intense pain, and could not
stoop or move about freely. I did not
know what to do to get ease, for the
remedies I used did me no good. See-
ing an advertisement for Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills led me to ti’y them.
They gave me relief right from the
first dose, and in a short time I was
cured. I have no sign of backache
now, and attribute my cure solely to
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Sixteen years later Mr. Bradd says:
“I have been free from backache since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me sixteen years ago. I am still a
great believer in this medicine, and
often take a few doses, as I think the
kidneys need a tonic sometimes.”
A WOMAN’S CASE
Mrs. F. Osmond, No. 8 Gilbert
Street, Manly, Sydney, says: “I was
a martyr to backache, and the pain at
times was almost unbearable. I also
had several other distressing symptoms
of kidney disorder, such as
dizzy feelings and sleepless nights. I
was always trying one remedy or
another, but derived no benefit from
any of them. One day a friend urged
me to take a course of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and this medicine
proved to be the very thing I wanted.

SYDNEY MAN CURED OF PILES BY
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. W. Solomon, Wentworth Street, Parramatta, Sydney, says: About
20 years ago I had a very severe attack of Itching and Bleeding Files, an
underwent an operation. I was right for about eight years, and then tne
complaint returned. The agony was terrible. Not wanting to undergo
another operation, I started using Pile remedies. The number I usedwo _
astonish you, but they gave me no benefit whatever. I read ot iJoans
Ointment curing others, and decided to give it a trial. After a tew appuca
tions I obtained relief and one pot cured me. I always keep Doan s Dintinenc
in the house, and shall never be without it, for I know what a tkorou 0 mj
good remedy it is.”
Ten years later Mr. Solomon says: “I have skill the same good opinion
of Doan’s Ointment. It cured me of Piles many years ago, and I never
suffer with this complaint now.”

drearily over the ten-minute, uphill Avalk to
his own quiet street. Through his neat gate
he passed on to the tidy path that ran sinu-
ously between the trim lawns. His wife
stood at the head of the steps that led up
to his neat little house; his son played beside
a circular flower-bed; his fluffy yelloAV dog
came bounding to meet him. Gravely Mr.
Quin trod the pebbled path. “Down,
Hector !” he said, and at once the yellow dog
came to heel. “We’ll have dinner at once,
Mary,” said Mr. Quin; and “Peter, come off
that bed!” And with firm and even tread,
ahead of his wife, his son and his dog, Mr.
Quin entered his castle.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“'ll ORNING,” said Mason, as he took
his chair at the breakfast table.
The otliei’s looked up from the
meal.
“Morning,” they replied, and resumed their
grills.
“You came last night, didn’t you?” asked
one of the others.
“Yes. I’ve heard a lot about Canungra,
so I decided to spend my next holiday here.
As we haven’t been introduced, may I men-
tion that my name’s Mason?”
“Mine’s Selsby. My friend’s is Ward.”
They nodded.
Selsby went on: “Yes, excellent place—
excellent scenery—dine views.” He waved an
expressive hand and upset the pepper.
“A number of my friends have visited the
place,” said Mason, “and liked it. Can you
advise me Avhere all the beauty-spots are?”
Selsby again : “Oh, yes. I suppose you’ve
noticed the mountains. Of course, Tambou-
rine is the best. There’s a fair road up, and
the top is magnificent. You can see from
Moreton Island to Point Danger.”
“I’m afraid I couldn’t run my car up
to-day. I had carburetter trouble last night
and could just crawl into Canungra. That’s
Avhy I arrived so late. I’m getting a man
to it after breakfast, but I don’t know how
long he’ll be.”
“Why don’t you walk up?” asked Ward.
“It’s about four miles, but it’s worth it.”
“I’m afraid I couldn’t do that either. You
see. I’ve been rather seriously ill and I’m
just recovering. A short climb would do
me good, but eight miles—l’m afraid I
couldn’t.”
“Then the mountain you should climb is
Darlington,” said Selsby. “It’s not far up
the end, and there’s a path along the side to
the Devil’s Garden.”
“The Devil’s Garden?”
“It’s a patch of scrub on this side of the
mountain about a mile and a half along.
Just hoav you’ll find some beautiful orchids
up there. They grow on the rocks. Won-
derful things!”
He .went on to a detailed description.
Mason thought he used too many superlative
adjectives.
The meal continued. They discussed the
relative merits of the surrounding beauty-
spots. Selsby discoursed on Miserie. “It’s
a strange mountain—narrow razor-back,” he
rambled on. “The man who took me up was
bitten by a snake. We didn’t see the thing
in the grass, and it got away. But he knew
it Avasn’t poisonous. It only made him a
bit sick.”
“How did he know it wasn’t poisonous?”
asked Mason.
“Don’t you know? Matter of fact, I didn’t
’till he told me. You can always tell by
the bite. If there are only two punctures it’s
non-poisonous; if there are more, it’s poison-
ous. That’s because non-poisonous snakes
have only two fangs at the top, while the
deadly ones Rave teeth on both jaws.”
“Handy to know,” said Mason, with a
smile. “I’ll remember that. And I’ll see
about wandering up Darlington.”
“You’ll haA 7 e no trouble. Just keep going
and you’ll strike the orchids.”
“Good. If you’ll excuse me I’ll attend to
my car.”
* * * *
Canungra is situated right at the foot of
Darlington, and so Mason began to climb
almost immediately he commenced his walk.
The road rose steeply, as it twisted through
the young timber and brushwood. Mason
Avalked slowly; he must be careful.
The road led him round the knobby end
of the mountain, through patches of moist
cool scrub, and then back again to the
Canungra side, until he. suddenly came upon
a little open flat. The country below bursr
into view. He had not realised that he had
ascended to such a height. Miserie sprawled
away to the north, with Tambourine running
parallel. Canungra drowsed at the feet of
these three. The farms looked like garden-
plots in various shades of green. The tOAvn
Avas a child’s box of toys. Mason could see
for miles up and down the valley of the
creek, which was marked by the serpentine
meanderings of the line of darker vegetation.
The railway lines shone in the sun like
silver threads. There was no sound save
the occasional chirp of a bird, and the “Pok,
pok, pok!” of the refrigerating plant in the
township. The land drowsed in the amber
sunlight.
Mason turned to go on. The road became
a track that scarred the green mountain side.
BeloAv him the green of the moving forest
Avas like a strange sea. Grass-trees hissed in
the wind, and thrust up long white Avands,
which Mason found were thousands of nectar-
laden flowerets croAvded on one stalk. They
were invaded by bees and butterflies and
numerous tiny insects. Clematis trailed
snowy curtains through the grass. The
yellow of the buttercups and golden-rod
was bright in the sun. Purple-top stained
the grasses, and little bluebells nodded over
old fire-charred trees. Mason found quaint
tiny boutons d’or, .and little violets with
purple liair-like fringes on the edges of their
petals, and creeping plants Avith orange
berries. He noticed particularly the absence
of red. Yellow, blue and white were common,
but no red.
The Avay was growing rougher. Basalt
boulders were scattered about the mountain-
side. Mason saw ahtiad the dark green of
scrub, and he knew it was the Devil’s Gar-
den of which Selsby spoke. As he approached
the path lost itself in the grass, and it was
necessary to scramble over stones and tree-
trunks. Soon he reached the spot. Two
giant figs reached up their grey moss-painted
arms, and their thick twisted roots crept
down into the rotting leaves and ferns and
bracken. Staghorns and elkhorns clung to the
rocks and trees: “birds’-nests” spread their
beautiful ellipsoid leaves.
The “garden” fell steeply down the moun-
tain side. Mason clambered across to the
edge. Then he saw his first orchid. It was
a foot below him. He reached for the spray
of creamy blossom. The flowers were truly
beautiful things; and their perfume was
exotic, sickly. The stamens were the yellow
of old cream. He had not realised that such
strange flowers flourished in Australia. They
were not like the wattle and the Australian
sun—frank, honest. That was the word —they
were not honest. Very beautiful, certainly, but
suggestive of jungle. He had read somewhere
that they were called “the flowers of death.
They grew in dark places, where the leaves
rot. Their overpowering perfume lacked
freshness.
He looked around for more. They trailed
over the rocks below. He took off his coat
and rolled up his sleeves, and began to climb
down carefully over the grey pentagonal basalt
columns that suggested the ruins of the
architecture of some old race. Strange how
basalt always crystallised out in pentagons !
Soon his arms were full, and he returned
to the top. Glancing down to the left, he
noticed an orchid of a different color. It
was pink. A pink orchid! He must have
that one. It was a difficult climb, and he was
not strong; but he decided to try. Working
down and across, he slowly approached it-,
grasping roots and monkey-ropes swinging
from the trees. At last he reached it. It
Avas a wonderful blossom. The petals were
the color of pink quartz. The stamens were
rich red. He grasped a rope in his left
hand while he reached across to pluck the
stalk well down near the base. He heard a
slight rustle of leaves, a thin hiss, and some-
thing dark struck at his arm. He jerked it
away, and the writhing thing went scrabbling
down, down the' rocks. It disappeared in
the leaves.
Everything was still. Mason hung, white
and panting. Slowly he looked at his arm.
The snake had bitten him just below the
elbow. He shuddered when he remembered
how the fangs had clung and he had to
shake them off. Here in the quiet had
lurked death. Thirty seconds ago he Avas
happy, with no thought of it, but n0w....
he might not see a fellow-man again. Every-
thing Avas strangely still. The pink orchid
Avith its scarlet heart still poured out its
sickening perfume.
Mason recalled Selsby's words. He
looked at his arm again. There were only
two punctures! It was non-poisonous! He
did not see the snake, as the whole incident-
had taken place so quickly, and he remem-
bered it only as a dark thing that had gone
twisting down into the rotting leaves. But
there Avere only two punctures. He would
be ill, perhaps—nothing more. The wound
was painful, and he found that his arm was
becoming numb. He realised that he must
get home. He climbed feverishly. Not until
then did ho realise, how weak lie was, And
his arm was beginning to swell. Perhaps
it was poisonous! He tried to suck the
wound, but he could not reach it with his
mouth, as the snake had struck him just
beloAv the elbow.
Ilis arm was extremely numb hoav. He saw
a Strange red mark under the skin. It must
have been poisonous. He started to run for
home, stumbling over the rocks and trees,
forgetting his coat and his orchids. He
stopped to scrape the wound on a projecting
rock in order to make it bleed, but he could
not reach it to suck out the poison.
He ran on, round the little narrow track,
on and 0n... . He was becoming drowsy.
His arm felt like a great load, and his shoul-
der hurt him. He Avas tired—tired. But
he knew that if once he lay down to rest he
would sleep for all time. All his limbs were
heavy. He mumbled delirious things.
He stumbled round the end of the moun-
tain, almost exhausted. Suddenly to the
right in the scrub lie heard whips. He
realised in a dazed fashion that teams were
hauling timber from the scrub. He stood
and listened. There ! Crack of whips ! He
did not hear the bullockies’ voices, but he
knew that the teams Avere just over the
edge. Leaving the track, he slithered doAvn
the grassy slope into the dark scrub. Lawyer-
cane whipped his eyes, and thin thorn-set
strings tore at his arms and neck. He
stumbled across a snigging-track, where the
pine-bark lay white and the oozing gum was
fresh and SAveet-smelling. Again and again
he heard the crack of Avhips. But there
was black before his eyes, and a myriad
of dancing spots.
“Flowers of Death! Funny.... deep red
heart.... sickening, strange. .. .Flowers of
Death.”
His head and chest were as in a vice, and
he breathed with difficulty. And just above
his heart it hurt!
“Selsby must be wrong....too many ad-
jectives .... Hi! Help!”....
Now and again he heard the whips, but
he never could come upon them. And he
wandered on.
* * * *
“That chap Mason hasn’t come back yet,”
said Selsby at lunch. “Wonder what’s
happened.”
“Yes. It’s late. He should be back by
now. Perhaps he’s hurt or something.
Snake, perhaps.”
“It would be queer if a snake did get him
after what he said this morning. And do
you know I was wrong when I said that non-
poisonous snakes have only two fangs? It’s
the other way round. I remembered after-
wards. He might have gone exploring some-
where else —perhaps into that inviting patch
of scrub just round the end.”
“Where’s that?”
“You know. Where we heard the AA Thip-
birds. Even now they deceive me sometimes.”
“I hope he comes soon. I don’t like it.
He couldn’t get lost. Something’s wrong.”
And as Selsby sugared his coffee, a scrub-
magpie peeped round a tree at a still figure
lying amid the ferns. The whip-birds sAvung
their long notes and then cracked them
across the scrub.
