Divorce or—Disgrace.
The Bulletin ,
SATURDAY, APRIL 10, 1886.
The Legislative Councillors of New South
Wales have for some weeks past been dis-
cussing a Bill introduced by Sir Alfred
Stephen and intended to empower the
Courts to grant relief by way of Divorce in
certain cases in which it is not now obtain-
able. This extension, if passed, would in-
crease the number of grounds for dissolu-
tion of the marriage tie by four—habitual
drunkenness, continuous desertion, commis-
sion of crime by either party, and repeated
assaults of a serious character. So far, but
scant attention has been paid to the sub-
ject by the daily Press, only the most meagre
reports of the debates having been pub-
lished, although the subject is of the highest
possible human interest. So deeply was
its importance felt by ancient communities
that in many instances the same word signi-
fies both “law” and “marriage.” Our
“ancients” in the Council are equally im-
bued with a sense of the gravity of the
question, and their customary legislative
farce has during the debate been superseded
by a political drama of even tragical
solemnity. Several members have been
able to beep awake during nearly the whole
of the speeches, and argumentative, if pon-
derous deliverances, have attacked or sup-
ported the Bill. That a progressive measure
of this nature should have originated in the
Upper House is of itself a remarkable fact’
but the narrow majority of three for the
second reading does not augur well for its
fate.
♦ * *
At the root of the whole question is the
contention that marriage is a divine institu-
tion ordained by Almighty wisdom, and not
to be dissolved by human agency, or that, to
use the words of the Hon. Charles Camp-
bell, “ after marriage has been made a civil
contract it receives a higher blessedness and
is madea sacred contracf’—and is, therefore,
beyond the power of dissolution by legal
process. This line of argument would avail
nothing with the advanced section of the
community who deny the right of religion
to make its voice heard in matters of legis-
lation, and although we hold with these
that human affairs should be regulated
solely by the power of human reason, it is
worth while to examine this claim in order
that we may see how far it can consistently
be urged.
« * *
It may be noticed at the outset that, ad-
mitting, for the purpose of argument,
marriage to tave been divinely
we are still left in doubt as to what sort of
marriage was sanctified with the higher
blessing touchingly alluded to by Mr.
Charles Campbell. Cain, for instance,
appears to have married his sister, Abra-
ham married with distressing frequency,
and Esau, Lamkch, and many others took
at least two wives, while King Solomon
showed his wisdom by selecting a huge
number of consorts. Then, too, the New
Testament states that a bishop should be
“the husband of one wife,” evidently mean-
ing thereby, not that he should be a married
man, but that he should have no more than
one wife. We are thus left in some doubt
as to the exact nature of the union dictated
by Divine ordinance. If, therefore, the
clerical party are thoroughly sincere in
their belief in the Divine ordinance of the
institution, they should endeavour to induce
Legislative councillors to assimilate the pre-
sent law of marriage to that which obtained
in earlier times by legalising incestuous and
polygamous unions. To be consistent in his
contention Mr. Campbell should uphold the
Mormon system, for that is certainly more
in accordance with the custom of the patri-
archs than that enforced by British law.
t » •
But we would go one step further, and
meet the clerical party on the ground which
they themselves have marked out, by quot-
ing from the marriage service of the Church
of England, wherein it is stated with a care-
ful attention to detail that matrimony “is
an honourable estate instituted of God ” for
three causes—Firstly, “ For the procreation
of children to be brought up in the fear and
nurture of the Lord; ” secondly, “As a
remedy against sin to avoid fornication ; ’’
and thirdly, “ For the mutual society, help,
and comfort that the one ought to have of
the other.” Now, accenting these causes as
true and reasonable ones for the institution
DR. AGNEW, THE NEW TASMANIAN PREMIER.
of the order, it will be perfectly clear to all
but the severely clerical mind, that in any
of the four oases enumerated by Sir Alpbed
Stephen, one, at least of these stated
objects of the ordinance is defeated. An
habitual drunkard is not likely to bring his
children up in “ the fear and nurture of the
Lord,’' nor to contribute much to “ mutual
help and comfort; ” neither is a man who
is doing say 10 years at Trial Bay prison;
nor yet a man who deserts his wife, nor one
who brutally assaults her. Seeing that in
such cases the objects for which matrimony
was ordained are frustrated, it is surely
opposed to the Divine will to continue that
bond which must defeat the aims for which
it was imposed. It is necessary thus to
notice the position of the priestly party on
this question, because their utmost influence
will always be exerted for the purpose of
throwing out any such measure, and their
word still has a large power with those who
are unable to discover for themselves the as-
sumption upon which their dictum is found-
ed. It may also be regarded as a matter of
absolute certainty that the clergy of all de-
nominations will plead for the Divine nature
of the institution, and the absolute necessity
of marriage within a church, so long as
wedding-fees continue to average five
guineas per ceremony; and so long as par-
sons and priests are believed when they say
that marriage before a registrar is nothing
more than legalised prostitution, it will
always be necessary for writers and legis-
lators to show the utter baselessness of such
presumptuous and libellous assertions.
To pass, then, from superstition to mat-
ters of fact, it is useful, in order to ascertain
the desirability of some such measure for
the extension of divorce, to remember that
the evils of the present system are such
that it is to the manifest benefit of all par-
ties personally affected to keep their griev-
ances as secret as possible. No meetings are
likely to be hold by wives deserted or bru-
tally ill-treated by their husbands. There is a
disgrace in these oases which compels the in-
jured one to suffer in silence. When the wife
is repeatedly assaulted by her husband she
may obtain a judicial separation, but that is
only halt the remedy she requires. Not only is
it desirable that she should be able to obtain
another help-meet if there be an oppor-
tunity of doing so, but it is useless to
shut our eyes to the fact that as Mr. Camp-
bell says we have “ a coarser feeling
which we inherit,” &o. Were all men and
women possessed with an overpowering
virtue, or were they all nonagenarian?,
there would be no necessity for considering
the frailty of human resolves, but it should
be evident even to a Legislative councillor
that all men are not so divinely virtuous,
and, therefore, “ this coarser feeling” and
its varying force must at present be
esteemed a factor of our national life. It is
not too much to say that in a large number
of oases in which one partner is permanently
removed by imprisonment or desertion, or
in which a judicial separation is granted, for
want of a divorce, disgrace is the accepted
alternative. Under the existing law, a mar-
riage celebrated with whatever solemnity
is declared null and void, if either party be
found upon examination to be physi-
cally unfit to become a party to such a
union, and the other partner is, of
course, then free to marry again, the
law in such a case judging that the-par-,
ties cannot be considered bound to one
another when the condition of marriage
would be an intolerable burden to either or
both of them, and yet though one partner
should be imprisoned for life, or be driven
by drink into hopeless lunacy, there is then
no relief for the sane partner. It would be
folly to allow divorce because either con-
sort has been deceived as to the character
of the other, but it is worse than folly to
refuse to loosen the bond of union which is
intolerable to the parties, as well as a prob-
able cause of grave misconduct to either of
them, and therefore a source of lamentable
social evil.
* * *
Ooe protest commonly made against any
extension of the law of Divorce, is based
upon the assertion that the loosening of the
marriage bond for aught save adultery pro-
motes all kinds of vice, and leads to a huge sys-
tem of national immorality. Mr. Campbell,
so far the most eloquent opponent of Sir
Alfred Stsphbn’s Bill, quotes the “easi-
ness of divorce” as the cause of that
national viciousness which led to the de-
struction of the Roman nation. He surely
can scarcely believe his own argument.
Was It, we would ask, the “easiness of
divorce” that induced Cato the Senten-
tious, to lend his wife to his friend Hor-
tensius? Or was it the same cause that led
the Romans into the commission of those
repulsive vices which Ovjd, and other clas-
tic writers, detail in such a disgustingly
deliberate manner? That divorces were
very easily obtainable when Rome was sunk
in the depths of degradation is certain
enough, but that this was the effect of the
viciousness of the age, and not its cause,
must be equally clear. A truer cause of
Rome’s decline, and we would commend
this fact to the consideration of the Cr<esdses
of the Council, was the exorbitant wealth of
the aristocracy, which paved the way first
for luxury in its most enervating shape, and
then for vice such as the world never before
nor ever since, beheld. A similar statement
is made with regard to the working of the
Divorce Laws in France, but it is not stated
that that country was renowned for the
singular virtue of its inhabitants before the
facilities for obtaining divorces were intro-
duced. America is also indicated as a
warning which should influence legislators
in determining to restrict the law to its pre-
sent powers, but it would be as well if those
who speak so deprecatingly of the States,
could produce some statistics or reliable in-
dependent testimony 'to prove that New
South Wales, and Sydney in particular, can
afford to throw the stone of condemnation
across the Pacific, In proportion to her
population, the capital of N.B.W. can
show an alarmingly large number of pro-
fessed ahandonnees, and it requires no effort


of imagination to believe that this miserable
army is largely recruited from, and sup-
ported by, that contingent of deserted wives
and husbands whom this present Bill is in-
tended to relieve.

Whether this Divorce Extension Bill be
ever presented for Royal assent or not, the
whole question is one which must, in the
near future, receive a larger measure of
attention than has ever been paid to it in
Australia in the past, and it seems more
than probable that the colonies will lead the
way in this question as they have already
done in the granting of manhood suffrage,
and various Liberal reforms. The welfare of
the children born of disastrous marriages
must be the Legislators’ chief object, and
allied to that must be the aim to prevent, as
far as may be possible, the harmful conse-
quences of a union which has become im-
potent for any good result, and only capable
of frustrating every purpose for which the
contract was made. On the other hand, no
concession may be granted which would act
as a temptation to persons to enter into the
married state believing that if the contract
should prove to be less advantageous than
they had hoped, a release therefrom could, by
any act of collusion, be easily obtained. Fool-
ish, improvident, and unhappy marriages,
will be made to the end of time, but it is only
when these become, by the criminal act of
one of the parties, an engine of grievous
wrong to the other and innocent con-
tractor, a cause of harm and degradation to
the children, and an agent of evil to the
community generally that the State can
justly interfere. That such State interfer-
ence is necessary; all must admit who are
not oppressed with the belief that it is an
act of sacrilege for men to meddle with
what the priests and parsons assert to be an
institution ordained and limited by the hand
of an unerring Providence. To those, on the
contrary, who believe that the human reason
is given for the purpose of its exercise in
the promotion of human good, such measure
will commend itself as a necessary and
highly beneficial reform.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “Free” salves of America.
In tbe o.M. Herald's American letter of March
13tb, is the following :
“Cotton is at the lowest figures ever touched,
but the planters are quite clear in the belief that
they need not be driven out of the business until
a large further decline is established. This hope-
fulness is generally attributed, even in the South,
to tbe abolition ot slavery, which, as contrasted
practically with free labour, is shown to be the
more expensive labour system of the two. In
other words, taking things on a grand scale, fear
was less potent in making the black man indus-
trious and Useful than is now the desire of getting
whisky and Yankee clocks and cheap pictures; and
the ill effects of abolition in the West Indies must
be accounted for, therefore, upon some other
theory than tbe Innate and irremediable laziness
of the African race.”
If this means anything, it is that the negroes of
America, of whose emancipation the world has
heard so much ever since 1866, cannot, by their
labour, earn even the meagre diet held by the
Legislatures of the Slave States to be necessary to
the maintenance of life. All history proves that
half measures lb no way help those for whose
benefit they are introduced, and the truth is that
when the American Union liberated the slaves,
but left the land from which they must still live,
in the hands of the planters, it did not improve the
condition of the negro except in name. While
a landowner was also owner of bis labourers, he
was compelled by law and interest-we say
nothing about humanity—to keep them in good
bodily health; in other words, to feed them well
and work them moderately. By the emancipation
of his slaves the planter was relieved from all
responsibility as to their maintenance, while, at
the same time, he was in a position to call all tbe
machinery of society to his aid to compel the
freed labourer to work for less than it cost to
maintain him as a slave. For men—be they black
or white—must eat, while society insists that they
shall not steal; and as the planter monopolises the
land from which they must get their living, he
can exact from them their labour at whatever
price he may choose to give them. Henry George
speaks of the land-monopolists reducing wages
to the “slave-point,” but, according to the S.M.
Herald’s correspondent, the men who “own” that
portion of God’s earth between the I’otpmac and
the Gulf of Mexico have reduced wages below the
“ slave-point.” Surely It must be immensely
gratifying to the fathers whose sons fell in front
of Lee’s artillery at Gettysburg to learn that the
Southern planters find they can extract more
profit from the sweat of the negroes to-day under
the institutions of thei“ greatest and freest Re-
public that earth has ever seen ” than they could
under the old system of acknowledged chattel
slavery. What reason have we to hope that what
is the state of the coloured labourer in America
to-day will not be the condition of his white
brother in another 30 years, or that this state of
things will confine itself to America ? Do not all
things at present point to the conclusion that
before the present generation has passed away
one of two things will have happened—that either
land will have ceased to be held as private pro-
perty, and the labourer will have free access to
nature’s store-house, and thus be really a free
man, or that the “ lower classes ” will be sweated
down one rung lower on the ladder, and be com-
pelled, like the American negroes of to-day, to
toil for less than a slave’s subsistence ? Let the
working men of this new land determine which
alternative their children shall have.

Orangeism and Annexation. 1
BARTrt-hunger, anew development of the J iugo
craze, and sectarian jealousy are the prime factors
of the fuss now being made in Sydney concerning
the annexation of the New Hebrides. The power
of the first impulse is seen In the applause which
invariably greets the statement that the group
contains 3500 square miles of fertile land; the
incitement of Jingoism, in the defiant oratory
which, not content with blaring out contempt for
France, threatens danger to England in the event
of any compromise being adopted: while the sec-
tarian yeast which is fomenting the disturbance,
is seen in the fervid and frothy “ skating ”—for it
is worthy of no more dignified name—of the
patriotic (to the salvation-cum-coooanut-01l inter-
est) Paton, and also in the presence of such noted
Orange bigots and Kiama ghost-raisers as were on
the platform with Sir Henry Parkes on Monday
night. The indig aation of those members who
are Orangemen first and politicians afterwards is,
if spontaneous, very convenient for the occasion:
and, if assumed, a clever mask to hide their bitter
sectarian hatred for the Jennings Ministry. They,
like the Melbourne ABaus, have interested sus-
picions, and the present opportunity gives them
a chance of displaying what Mr. Dibbs rightly
terms their “ spurious loyalty,” and aiming a blow
at a hated Cabinet, sufficiently armed, at the time
of writing, against other attack. The Argus Is
not ashamed to say: -
“ By and bye Australians may be able to get at
the whole story of why Sir Patrick Jennings,
Mr. Garvan, and their colleagues now view the
cession of the islands from what appears, on the
face of it, to be the anti-English as well as the
anti-Australian point of view.”.
This is nothing, if not an insinuation that Sir
Patrick Jennings and Mr. Garvan, the
Romanist members of the Ministry, are selling the
interests of their own land at the dictation of
their own creed—that they are betraying their
country for the sake of handing over a few
alleged Presbyterian niggers to the teaching of
the Church of Rome. So base and manifestly
false an allegation proves not only with what
Christian fervency the Argus people hate a
Romanist, but also to what desperate straits they
are driven for arguments to buttress a rotten
cause. Were it not that the miserable conflict of
the Orange and the Green is involved, Australia
would not be sufficiently interested in the ques-
tion to call a solitary meeting or pass a single re-
solution; but as the “Bloody Shirt ” of Australian
polities has been brought out by the reiteration
of Parkes’ cry for “ Protestant Ascendancy,” the
yelping bigots, who mustered so strongly at
Sydney Town Hall on Monday night, are ready to
clothe themselves with fantastic and wondrous
arguments, as with a garment, to hide the utter
repulsiveness of their skins, pock-marked and
disfigured with the scars of sectarian strife. Even
Sir Henry Parkes, with all his ingenuity
of reasoning powers and oratorical force,
was obliged to go forward to the “ end of next
century” for his principal argument. Unless
it be granted that England has a Divine mission to
annex any and every part of the world which can-
not be defended by its own native inhabitants, it is
Impossible to get any tangible pretexts for this
Pacific steal, or to see what good can result there-
from. As we have frequently pointed out, the
extension of territory can be of no benefit to a
community which now owns more land than it
can utilise in the course of the next two centuries,
and the “ protection to our coaits ” to be secured
by enlarging the territory to be defended in time
of war, by the inclusion of a group of islands
nearer to the ports of a possibly unfriendly power
than to any part of Australia, and isolated from that
continent, is a piece of strategic blundering that
only needs mention to ensure derision. When
the interested clamour of a section of the citizens
of Sydney for the annexation of New Guinea was
raised we opposed it, and asserted that the
Monroe doctrine should be rigidly confined to
the mainland of Australia. Now that part of that
island has been annexed we have the humiliating
spectacle of the colonics haggling over the cost,
and refusing to increase the necessary subsidy for
the maintenance of the territory annexed at
their request. Sir Patrick Jennings would have
done better, perhaps, to regard the motion by Sir
Henry Parkes as being merely one of pro-
spective character: then the question would
have been defeated on its merits, instead
of becoming to many a me ms with which
to harass an obnoxious Cabinet. But ad-
mitting that Sir Patrick has erred in this
way, it is the only mistake which can justly be
urged against him. For to suppose that his view
of the question is subject to considerations as to
the future creed of a few natives who now believe
in Paton but might in the event of French occu-
pation be converted to Moran, is to accede to a
libellous imputation that could only bo ©volvt d
from a mind saturated by bigotry and dominated
by sectarian malice. He has taken a dignified and
statesmanlike view of the whole question and has
acted consistently therewith, and contrasting his
attitude with that of Sir Henry Parkes, any
occurrence which would have the effect of
changing their respective positions In the House
while the New Hebrides question is still unsettled,
would be a disaster to Australia.

Payment of Members.
As The Bulletin by its publication of argu-
ments in favour of Payment of Members in
N.S.W. first brought the question of payment of
members within the area of practical politics, we
look with satisfaction on the majority obtained by
Mr. Heydon on his motion to initiate the system.
It is unfortunate that the principle should be
affirmed just at a time when the country is in
such dire financial straits, but as it is a principle,
the mere monetary consideration should not carry
much weight. Questions of cost cannot affect the
soundness of a principle. If it be not right to go
to the Treasury for salaries for members, it is
wrong to take the Ministers’emoluments there-
from. Sir Henry Parkes does not believe that
the country is in favour of the payment of mem-
bers. If he is right in his opinion it is strange that
so many men who expressed themselves in its
favour were elected. At St. Leonards election the
contest was a mere duel between Sir Henry and
Mr. Dibbs, but in every other constituency the
question was kept fully to the [front, so much so
that when members took their seats lists were
published in several of the newspapers showing
the number of those who affirmed the prin-
ciple. Mr. G. A. Lloyd thought that pay-
ment of members always a de-
terioraiion in the personnel of Parliaments.
Such was emphatically the case in Victoria.” The
evident retort to this by Victorians would be that
—hallelujah I—there is no Honourable-within-the-
Colony Lloyd in their Parliament. Mr. W. J.
Foster did not think that members should be paid,
although he “had no objection to take foes,”
which, coming from a lawyer, was quite an un-
necessary piece of information. Mr. Burdekin
naturally enough opposed the motion. If it were
passed, rich men of his stamp would find it less
easy to obtain admission to the Assembly. It
would cease to be in any respect a rich man’s
club. Nor is it strange to find Mr. Want on the
same side. Sydney lawyers now find it a compara-
tively easy matter to get in for a country consti-
tuency, but if local men were enabled to undertake
the duties of representation, the metropolitan
barrister would very frequently find himself at
the wrong end of the poll. If the arguments so
far advanced by Mr. Heydon's opponents are the
best that can be used, there should be little reason
to fear that many of the present supporters of the
motion will be won over to the other side, and
although several of the 41 who voted with Mr.
Heydon did so only to allow of further corsidera-
tion of the matter, there should still be a majority
sufficient to bring the system into operation. This
reform being instituted will facilitate the intro-
duction of other progressive and beneficial mea-
sures. Although a principle itself, it is also a
powerful means to an end unattainable without
its assistance.
After the refreshment hour on Tuesday night
Sir Patrick Jennings delivered his Budget
speech in the New South Wales Assembly. His
proposals are to so large an extent based upon right
principles, and are in the main so just in their in-
cidence that they are not likely to be subjected to
material amendment. The proposed new taxes
include 5 per cent, ad valorem duty, besides some
increases in the list of specific duties, which
will have the effect of removing existing
anomalies ; increased stamp duties, and
an alteration in probate duties by means
of graduation—ranging from 1 per cent, where
the value of an estate is under £5OOO, to 5
per cent, when the total value is over £50,000; an
unimproved-land tax of in the £ with exemp-
tion for estates under £IOCO, and an income tax of
4d. in the £, Incomes under ££oo per annum being
exempted. The increased specific duties are ex-
pected to yield £68,000 ; ad valorems, £300,00Q ;
stamp and probate duties £65 000 ; and land
and Income tax £350,000, making a total of
£683.550 to be raised by means of the
new imposts The estimates of expenditure
have been cut down from £9,113,881, as estimated
by Mr. Burns, to £8,533,358, - a reduction of
£513,038; and the revenue, if the taxation pro-
posals be adopted, is estimated at £9,033.050,
which, if realised, will reduce the deficit, which
was £1,309,471 at the end of 1885, by £499,693. These
proposals practically embody several principles
which we have constantly asserted as necessary to
a just system of taxation, and we do not believe
that a majority of the House will be found willing
to reject any of the main points ef the taxation
programme.
♦
The present New South Wales Ministry are a
secretive set. They have refused to answer a
question asked by Mr. Harold Stephen, M.L.A.,
as to the names of the vast army of public Hoggers
and what they get for flogging prisoners per head,
or per annum. Wo strongly recommend Mr.
Stephen to press his demand for information on
this point. In England it has just been discovered
that the assistant hangman is a baronet, who
chokes people because he likes it; and, we ask, who
in N.S.W. can be cerJain, in the absence of an
authoritative and properly substantiated state-
ment to the contrary, that the principal doggers,
or some of their numerous deputies, are not the
representatives of the “first families” of (he
colony—that our (loggers are not descendants
of the colonial first-flogged ? Who, tell us, is in a
position to say that the official cord and wire cat-
’o-nine tails is not at the present moment swinging
In the hands of members of a high-toned society
which—positions having during the last few years
been somewhat reversed—is desirous of wiping
out with the lash the wrongs of its square-
jawed ancestors ? Who knows, for the matter of
that, that the principal scourger may not fee a
member of Parliament, or of tbe Jennings Minis-
try itself? Under all the circumstances of the
case, we are inclined to regard the refusal of the
Government to afford information concerning tie
names, &0., of the public floggers, as a dastardly in-
sinuation designed to injure the credit of the
Companions of the most distinguished and honour-
able Order of St. Michael and St. George.

The Sydney Musical Corps— alias the public band
—which, like everything else, from Dan. O’Con-
nor to Beersheba, is “ under the patronage of
Lord Carington,” had a public meeting in the
Town Hall the other night, and thereat (also
equally as a matter of course) Daniel aforesaid
spouted. The hon. sec., Mr. Moonen, bad pre-
viously issued a circular rapturously dwelling on
“the humanising influence of music.” We wish
Mr. Moonen Jived at our hashhouse. We wish he
lived for one single weak in a cold inhospitable
abode of sodden mutton and ruined tarts where
ten skinny daughters, who had stayed up till one
a.m. the night before, stealthily but steadily hug-
ging on the doorstep a set of miserable bank
clerks and half-starved Lands officials, arose and
proceeded to—ablute, to turn on the bath-
tap? No. To bray out the “Woodpecker” and
“ See-saw,” and Hamilton’s everlasting and never-
to-be-sufficiently-oursed Exercises—to freeze the
blood of us who are slowly dying of insomnia, and
who will one day be picked up in the streets with
hopeless paralysis of the brain—to ruthlessly
rattle and thump on a piano which naught saves
from the clutches of the bailiff—Heaven bless and
speed him I—but the economy, involving our star-
vation, sempiternally practised by their slatternly
screw of a mother. “ The humanising influences of
music! ” Does this man Moonen know the musi-
cal home of the fat usurer who lives close to
the den, yclept boarding-house, where we atrophise
in every fibre upon chopped-up oat’s meat and
coffee made out of horse-liver ? Does he know
the house wherein on the evening of the holy Sab-
bath, the sons and “the daughters of Solyma, whose
noses overshadow the land ” pull up their win.

sausage-machine, of your mother-in-law—of the

David Buchanan, barrister-at-law and orator,
sneers at aquatics and at Beach, the champion
sculler. David, you aren’t the man who should
heave rocks at Beach's boat. We don’t believe in
making a god out of a waterman, but all the same

to put something into it. He has never been an

He never published any two-column letters in the

volumes of “Australian Orations” originally de-
livered in tones like the roaring of a Scotch-born

a heaven which has been too kind to you, the
dove-like innocence of a thousand hopeless horse-
thieves since turned loose on an otherwise peace-
able community. David Buchanan,— we tell you
that William Beach is not accountable for the
non-conviction of a legion of abandoned cow-
stealers, and for verdicts which have brought
more rum and sorrow to the home of the brute,

What may happen to a man who is down on his
luck. A poor sailor named Jennings has of late
been an outdoor boarder in Sydney Domain, and
the other day met some journeymen tailors from
the fashionable establishment of Messrs, Savage
and Gibson who took pity on the ragged mariner,
and, after sharing their dinners with him, pre-
sented him, one with a coat, another a hat, a third
a pair of trousers, and so on, until he at last
stepped out quite a new man and proceeded to
give the girls a treat upon the “ Block.” Before
he had taken two-and-a-tialf turns, however, he
was arrested on suspicion of having stolen his new
outfit, and brcause he could not tell the names of
his patrons he was next day promptly sent up for
a fortnight in Darlinghurst Gaol. The ancients
used to say: “It is cruel to confer favours on the
poor, for by so doing you merely prolong their
lives and their misery.” Indiscriminate oharity-
bestowers should make a note of that, and persons
who donate clothes should always be careful to
leave their csrds with the recipients at the same
time. Still, we do not unreservedly condemn the
police for putting the sailor into prison because he
was too well r.'gged out. Now that being fashion-
ably-dressed is a crime, we look forward with
much pleasure to seeing ail the George-street
mashers step into the gaol-van.

Who next ? The air of N.B.W. is heavy with
rumours. This is the season when the bank-
manager can be found neither at the office nor at
any of his various well-appointed suburban
homes ; the season at which the well-connected
lawyer with or without endless trust funds makes
no answer to his client’s urgent telegram but goes
away to see De Lesseps on the Panama Canal
question ; the season in which the real-estate
speculator, up to his neck in “syndicates” and
overdrafts, skips to the pleasant island of Hono-
lulu where extradition warrants run not and the
thermometer never exceeds 90. By and bye we shal j
see a" list of “ Clearances ” outside the shipping
column of the morning paper: “Mr.Zo-AND-zo,per
barque Hospodar, bound for the Republic ot Ecua-
dor. He took half-a-mlllion. He was at onetime
much respected, and his absence is deeply regretted
by 14 building societies.” The Sydney land-manis,
the reign of mad speculation in suburban “build-
ing sites ” not big enough for single grave lots, is
culminating, and its history will be written at lei-
sure in Valparaiso, or—in gaol.
Sib Alkxndbr Stuart has, it is cabled, decided
to “ignore” the London Weekly Dispatch,
which lately libelled him. We are sorry for the
Dispatch. The proprietress, Mrs. Ashton Dilke,
is a widow, and it is sad to think that her
paper should thus be ruined. Abuse sometimes
kills people, but when a colonial potentate wants
to slay in one act a London weekly with a quarter-
million circulation and a history of, say 30 or 10
years, he has but to “ ignore" it, and the fatal
deed is done. Mrs. Dilke, therefore, must
now contrive to get her living out of the Referee,
the only other journalistic property left her by
her late husband. We trust that Alexander,
when he gazes upon the ruin he has made, will
now be merciful. We do hope he will spare the
Referee, out of which the greatest turf-and-
athletic writer, “ Pendragon,” contrives to screw
his humble crust.

Remarked Mr. R. B. Smith, M.P,, at his farewell
banquet The branch of the legal body to
which I am attached is, as the late Sir John
Dickinson (for nlany years a most distinguished
Judge) put it, not only an honourable but a noble
one, if its members maintain their dignity and
integrity.” Now, as Bubdbtt has always had
plenty dignity, likewise sufficient integrity, it is,
of course, plain that lie is not only honourable but
noble. Q.B.D. That is granted. But did Mr.
Smith quote the harmless platitude of Sir John
aforesaid—which, by the way, is as true with
regard to the profession of a fish-hawker as with
respect to that of an attorney-did he quote it, we
ask, apologetically and while overwhelmed with
sorrow because of the way in which certain of his
brother solicitors have been carrying on with
their trust funds lately ?

In the Crawford v, Crawford and Dilke
divorce ease, tbe chief witness was the petitioner,
Donald Crawford, and his evidence consisted of a
recital of his wife’s alleged admissions, (corrobo-
rated by from her diary,) which were to
the effect that Sir Charles Dilke visited her six
weeks after hjr marriage, took a fancy to her
“becauseshe wai so like her mother,” and after-
wards took her to a house on Tottenham C eurt-
roal, where he seduced her. Subseq teatly,
according to tils Interesting narrative, she
visited his house, and w is invited t> take a
third place on the couch already apnrooriated
by Fanny, the reputed mistress of Sir Charles.
Mrs. Crawford did not like to do this, tout says her
narrative, “ I did it because ho seemed to wish It.”
Constant visits seem to have been made subse-
quently, but ceased after some months’ continu-
ance, and nothing more would probably have
been beard of the baronet’s alleged treachery bad
not anonymous letters, attributed by Mrs. Craw-
ford to her mother, been sent to the injured hus-
band, who thereupon enquired of his wife as to
their truth, and brought Inis suitlu consequence
of the Information hla wife volunteered. The
other evidence given was by two domestics, one
of whom had, while the other had not, been aware
of Mrs. Crawford’s clandestine visits. The re-
spondent did not attempt to refute the petitioner’s
evidence, even by means of cross-examination,
nor did Sir Charles Dilke give evidence, his coun-
sel, the Attorney-General, refusing to “put him
into the witness-box to be cross-examined as to
the indiscretions of his life, from which none of us
are free.” Counsel asserted that for the reason
alleged they took upon themselves the responsi-
billty of his silence, and applied that he be dis-
charged from the suit because there was no evi-
dence to inculpate him. The judge, strictly follow-
ing precedent In his decision, dismissed the peti-
tion against the baronet as co-respondent with
costs, but granted a divorce to the petitioner on
account of his wife’s adultery with the co-respon-
dent against whom there was no evidence. Thus
Crawford’s evidence was accepted as proof that
his wife had committed adultery with Sir
Charles, but did not declare him guilty
ot the same misconduct, a decision which—
to use the words of an English lawyef—
“ n ust surprise everyone who is not sufficiently
learned to have Inst his common-sense.” In any
case, Sir Charles Dilke do-ss not come out of the
case with any credit to himself or the aristae-
racy of which he is a prominent member. If the
allegations are true, be is a libertine of the first
water; if untrue, his counsel admit their un-
willingness to allow him to undergo cross-exam-.
ination “as to the indiscretions oMiia past life,”
from which, as they pathetically. If enigmatically
admit, “we are none of us free.” We are told by the
society editor of a Sydney weekly that the arrival
of Sir Charles Dilke is looked for in Sydney with
considerable anticipations, and that he will be a
great addition to the social festivities. So he will
be a great aUdition-but millions would not tempt
us to say what sort.

They sey that the King of Bavaria, when
he travels from one palace to another, to see his
girl, does so in a manner superior to that of the
Yankee auctioneer. Newton. We had thought,
when we saw Mr. N.’s turn out, that nothing but the
Lord Mayor’s coach (for which we have always had
a gloomy sort of respect) could eclipse it in splen-
dour. The following, however, from an English
paper, has somewhat disturbed our faith in old
recollections “ Out of the darkness of the night
there suddenly flashes upon the astonished sight of
the belated traveller a sledge, fashioned like a
golden swan with outstretched wings, and lighted
by a brilliant electric light. Within, reclining on
richly-embroidered cushions of blue velvet, is
seen the pale-faced King, in whose artistic hat
gleams a splendid agrafe of brilliants.” Yet to
think, that while ‘‘the artistic hat” would alone
suffice to get a man six months in this country, a
hundred workmen have to be constantly employed
stump-extracting and otherwise fixing the road
oyer which this mad regal rascal travels. After
all it is finer to be a king than have a house in
Maclcay-street, Sydney, and a man in second-hand
gaiters and wash-leather gloves to drive you, of a
morning, to the office.

fair samples of tbe new generation of nobility.
Solidity of thought and manner was the Prominent
characteristic of the former regime, affability
verging upon gush, and universal—almost hysteri-
cal—appreciation of everything aQ d everybody
are the most prominent attributes of the coming
generation of hereditary legislators. |( lt was Lord
Kosebery who sent that historical well done
wire, when N.B.W. embarked in the goat-and-
glory hunting business, and since that date he has
been ever engaged in plastering marmalade on to
one or other of the toadies. The only way in
which this youthful peer ean be adequately re-
warded is by the offer to form some part of Aus-
tralia (say Pinchgut or Goat Island) into a separate
kingdom and instal him as the first ruler.

been reduced by a long course of dissipation .

turer after that.
In the Masai Land, the men keep the
secret of making fire to themselves on the suppo-
sition that, if confided to the women, the latter
would be masters. The experience of Sydney
husbands contradicts the suppositions of these
savages; the woman may know how to make a
fire, but she nretends ignorance, and, being boss,
the old man is compelled to get up first or go to
work empty.
The Victorian Government is considering
the advisableness of adopting a system of allow-
ing persons found guilty of first offences of a
petty nature to' remain outside the gaol on proba-
tion. When the simple shop girls annexes a few
yards of lace and any before.time honest man com-
mits an error, why should they be degraded out
of hope of redemption by being thrown into pri-
son to herd with brutal felons ? Why should they
not rather be allowed a chance of resuming the
narrow track under State supervision ? To our
mind the idea has some advantages over the lash
theory.
Another fine fad of the N.S.W. Telegraph
Department has just gone bung. After a careiul
trial of three months, the system of prepayment
of telegrams by postage stamps has proved to be
a most successful failure. This we predicted from
the start. Educated at the public expense, so to
speak, our telegraphic experimentalists, with the
very best intentions, no doubt, Indulge their Quix-
otic notions; their bleeding country has to stand
the racket. If the experiments are successful, tho
glory is theirs; If they sre failures, the loss is ours.
“ Heads I win, tails you lose," Is the safe system
of their play. A few years ago something like
£4OOO was slopped away by tho telegiaphic scien-
tists in the introduction of Wheatstone automatic
instruments, and after a most disastrous run of
13 months, or so, it was discovered that
the system was totally unsuited to the long
and badly-insulated lines of the colony, and
the costly instruments were therefore relegated
to the bottom Of the store-cellar, where they have
probably rusted and rotted ever since. The next
fad tried was the delivery of telegrams by mes-
sengers on tricycles, but beyond affording much
amusement for the street larrikins, who used to
“ hang on behind,” and frequently monopolise
the three-legged steeds altogether, this smart
notion fared no better than the other. But the
Treasury paid the piper all the same. The repay-
ment of messages by specially-printed telegraphic
stamps was the next idea introduced, and this
proved to be such a complete success that a high
official was enabled to skip the country in a few
months’ time, and it was calculated that a station-
master's billet would soon be as lucrative as that
of a Psalm-singing bank manager or a night
policeman. As this proved too much ]oy for the
colony altogether, our bold innovators took a
rest, and during the spell divers wise men were
sent over to Melbourne to take stock of the doings
there The result was that a barelaced plagiarism
of the Victorian system of prepayment of tele-
grams by postage stamps was put forward here as
In original idea of our own wiseacres; the rea-
son 'given for the charge being that it would
facilitate the public business, and do away
with the disastrous blocking ot the lines occa-
sioned by balancing the accounts between the
various stations every morning. Grandfather
Norton, who happened to be Postmaster-General
at the time, even went so far as to state In the
House that several business men had waited on
him and prayed for the innovation on this parti-
cular ground. Now, however, we are coolly told
that It was started to provide a safeguard for the
revenue and put a check on the commission of
frauds, the inference being that fraudulent prac
tlces prevail throughout this erratic department.
However, it is now admitted to be a failure even
in these respects, and if we mistake not, one
officer is—or very recently was-in trouble
over some monetary muddles which this sapient
system failed to prevent. After such a disastrous
career in the experimenting line one would
naturally imagine that cur crushed innovators
would hide their diminished heads for a time, but
nothing appears to bo farther from their thoughts.
Having recovered from the fatigue of his picnic
tour on the " Continong,” Mr. Superintendent
Cracknel! has started a new scheme for carrying
telegraph wires in an up and down fashion througn
the city. The credit (IE any) of this Invention
is claimed for the Department, hut as a matter
of fact, the idea is as old as a Christy minstrel
wheeze, as this identical scheme was laid before
the directors of the Bell Telephone Company in
New York some six years ago, and the plans of
the same are still in their hands. The directors of
this company (amongst rvhom are some of the
shrewdest and most experienced men in New
York) decided, however, that the scheme would
never do; and yet this is the thing that hasalre dy
been started in Sydney atk cost of say £5OOO, Tne
probabilities are that it will cost much more, and
that as soon as it ii completed it will suddenly he
found to he as' great a failure as the rest of the
fads which from time to time have brought so
much ridicule on the Telegraph Department, and
have been the cause of such a scandalous waste
of the public revenue. If our olfic als must go on
introducing new notions, let them try the'r hants
cn the formation of a system of telegraphic des-
patch which will enable an urgent telegram to
gravel a tiifle faster than a wooden-legged man
can kick his hat.

I think it due to you to speak with no uncertain

that the opinion of the members should have

the more incumbent on the directors as the deci-

The “LOUIS”
VELVETEIN.
The strictest examiner may try every test of touch
and sight without discovering that these are other
than the Genoa Velvets which they so closely resem-
ble, while the peculiar- arrangements resulting in the
fast woven pile enable them to stand intewmnable
and rough wear, which would ruin real velvets at
four times the price. For Costumes and
Trimmings it is unequalled, and in fact
for all purposes in which Silk Velvet
may be used we specially recommend
the “LOUIS” VELVETEEN.

COMMENCE THE YEAR RIGHT.
Don’t make too many resolutions, but hold on
like grim death to those you do make. If your
physical syrem Is out of order you should attend
to that at once, for it's no use trying to keep a stiff
upper lip when your kidneys or liver are taking
the courage out of you. if you have really made
up your mind to turn over a new leaf, commence
the year by taking a thorough course of the cele-

SERIOUS THOUGHTS.
A merchant alone in his lonesome store,
I said to him as he paced the floor,
“ What are you thinking about, my dent?
“I am thinking about St. LOUIS BEER.
A glass of Wolfe's Schnapps at bed time
will give you a sound nlght’a rest.
Good grog out of inferior glassware is less
desirable than indifferent grog out of good
ware, and may it not be said in reference to food
also? Does it not give an edge to the appetite
to have one's food not only n.cely pooked , ,
served'n nice crockery ? After getting accus-

la “ Dark Days,” now drawing to a close
at Sydney Royal, Messrs. Seagrave and Stirling
Whyte are noticeable characters in the Assize
C mrt at Tewnham, where the scene of the last
act Is la<d. They are the counsel for and against
the murderer Evans. Both maintain the average
honesty of look found on the faces of the wearers
of wigs in N.B.W. This is well. It proves that
Messrs. Seagrave and Whyte think nothing of
hard work when the purposes of art are to be
served. , •
Honest looks are, we admit, no guarantee
that the hearts are honest. Still, their presence
adds to the agroeableness of life. Every man
owes to his fellows the duty of looking honest, it
he conveniently can. That duty becomes impera-
tive on a dishonest man. Internally he is a sore
whose gangrened lips sicken the eyes of those
with a swift faculty of penetration. He will
not cure the sore, or let it be cured. It
profits him to have it suppurate, to have it
run. It is, then, his duty to make himself
up externally, so tha* penetrating people may
have some green spot on which to rest the eye.
For sake of others, too, he is bound to attend to
his looks. There are men and women in whom
the primitive virtues still abide. These think of
higher things than cozening specs, and gawky
precedences. They are at home in the open air.
There Is communion between them and sky and
plain and river. Some gold is needful, but no gold
would buy from them the delight they take in
walking under a wide expanse of radiant sky. A
thousand gawky ceremonial successes could not
equal as sources of pleasure a day’s ramble by a
rippling river. Beside the spectacle of a flock
of wild ducks on a broad lagoon, with
the morning sun looking over from the east
hnd the spring breeze stirring the high
grass and sedges along the margin, the largest
assemblage of millinery-made beauties in the
finest drawing-room in the land is only a mottled
spot in a Stuffy smoky chaos. The dishonest man
fehoulfi not obtrude his dishonesty on these.
Blther he should not show himself at all to them,
or be should make himself up so as to be at least
as unobjectionable as a post in a paddock-fence.
Properly, he ought to spread cloths saturated with
carbolic acid over the gangrened lobes of his
heart. He ought to lubricate the region with
ointment of spikenard, and fumigate his presence
generally with a steaming censer of frankincense
and myrrh. But, at the very least-the very
lowest—he should show the average honesty of
face of a N.S.W. barrister.

We said last week that Mr. Vincent did
hot inflict any pain on his audience. In the rUe
he played, that showed able acting. He had to be
a fop, with the usually empty head, in most
parts, while in some it was his fate to approach
that specimen of attenuated humanity known as
the dude. This latter thing is in real life so con-
temptible that Its presentation on the stage can
never be a success. It is capable of analysis; can,
as has been found, be resolved into bicarbonate
of cheek, nitrate of stare, oxala f e of cuffs, and
chloride of coat-tail; it can also be conceived as a
thing that has been melted and poured into a pair
of narrow-legged pants; butasa depositary of any
human passion, sentiment, or idea it can never
occupy standing room anywhere but before the
female of its own class. A healthy girl wduld
rather kiss the nose of a rat-catching terrier than
the best specimen of the dude the world has pro-
duced. Mr. Vincent was more pup than dude, but
that he was able to got through without making
one long to go outside and kick a dog teUS strongly
In bis favour.

You are bound to like this little notice;
for we are writing it in the best of spirits. We
have Just come home from the Sydney Gaiety
Theatre, where we have passed hilarious moments,
and have been, so to speak, cheek by Jowl with
vice-royalty. We always go when the Governor
goes : partly because we wish to demonstrate that
we are “about yet,” but chiefly because on
•‘.Command nights ’• the humours of the theatre
are Infinite and exuberant. In a general way, we
don’t enjoy the theatre for the theatre's sake ;
because, in answering the calls of duty, we have
been dosed dramatically to a very large extent
during the present decade ; but when his Excel-
lency Baron Bob honours the play with .his
presence and patronage we always make a point
of doing likewise, and fixing, whenever it is prac-
ticable, the vice-regal party with our glittering
eye.
• * •
On our arrival on Saturday evening, the
scene presented an aspect of unwonted liveliness.
As a friend observed when he marked the streams
of people and lines of vehicles: "It might have
been a fight." The lessee, Mr. John Solomon,
stood in the vestibule ready to receive his distin-
guished patrons. He was an imposing spectacle,
having lifted himself Into perhaps the very fullest
evening dress that has ever bedecked the figure
of mortal man. Complimenting him upon his
dazzling appearance, we remarked that he was
quite the Beau Brummel. “ Brummel,” repeated
John, musingly ; " What d’ye mean ? Why, he
was the man who trained Tim Fogarty." But if
the exterior of the theatre presented a busy ap-
Eearance, what shall wesay of theauditonum? We
ad har-lly entered; the swing-doors had scarcely
closed upon us when we were at once converted
into a pillar of merriment. Right at the entrance
Johnny had static, ed two halberdiers, whom he
had habited in some of the choicest garments of
the theatrical wardrobe. They wore scarlet velvet
ooato. trimmed with gold braid 2ln. wide, laced
waistcoats, which kept one-half of their legs
warm, Louis XI. stockings, and Brick-
field Hill (Sydney) shoes, with a liberal
amount of polish. Transfixed by this spec-
tacle, we could only lean In an angle of the
wall in order to looover, but were almost Imme-
diately crumpled up again by beholding Johnny
festively pushing open the door, and gazing upon
his handiwork wltn looks of undiluted pride and
admiration.
•
Although, in consequence of the excited
state of the ushers, some eccentricity was an-
parent in the manipulation of the audience while
seating them, it must bo admitted that the aooom-
modation provided for his Excellency was lavish.
Bore Johnny again shone. Here again were evi-
dences of bis mighty mind—of the gorgeousness—
wo might even add, the Orientalism of his ideas,
lie had caused to be partitioned off for the vice-
regal party a velvet-lined cow-pen In the front
seat which would easily have accommodated 50
people. The barricade was of bright red, but the
furniture was old gold plush, and blue, and pea-
cock, and red. And Howeral There was a regular
wall of pota uprearlng itself before the orchestra;
and there were also bouquets wherever it was
convenient to put them. Just before the
commenced, the lessee stole in to have one last
gaza at this enchanted bower. The effect, as he
himself graphically expressed it, was "nobby."
And, wo believe, the Governor subsequently
thought so. tool We said to Johnny, “ Why don t
you put a clock in?” At this suggestion his face
lit up with an electric glow, hut a moment later
his features were suffused with the cloudlets of
regret. It was, he explained, too far to send.
♦ ♦ •
The curtain rose on the near piece at about
twenty past 8, at which hour the vice-regal enclo-
sure hadn’t even a goat in it; and the gods began to
give vent to some expressions of discontent and
derision, many regarding the non-appearance of
the Governor in the light of a “ have on part of
the management. In the lower part of the house,
tob, gloom was universal, and perhaps never did
this curtain rise on a farce under more threatening
I circumstances. We sought, of course, to confine
opr attention to the action of the play, but we
must confess that it was, at times, much distracted
by the frequent appearances of Johnny Solomon
in;the auditorium, who surveyed his princely pre-
parations with looks of anguish, but consoled such
of the Pilgrims from Judea as were around him,
by the words: “The push is bound to turn up.
I’ve sent for ’em
• • *
Such was the temper of the audience that
anything less funny than the first act of the
“Great Pink Pearl” would have been whistled
through the roof in the first 10 minutes. And
the first act of the piece would not be so remark-
ably funny, mind you, had the interpretation been
less skilful.
• • •
The “Great P.P.” has as many plols as an
Orange lodge, and the situations change as rapidly
as the views of prominent politicians. The
primary trouble is brought about by the delivery
of a letter from the Princess Pennikoff concerning
the loan of 6,000,000 francs on the security of the
Great Pink Pearl, to Anthony Sheen, a bailiff-
hunted journalist, instead of to Anthony Sheen, an
American millionaire. Then Patrucio Gormani
(formerly Patrick Gorman) shows Sheen, the jour-
nalist, tne way to a fortune, and the two, after
wiring to the capitalist anent the advance, get
away from the bailiffs and start for Paris. While
they are waiting for the Princess, Mary Turner,
formerly the be girl of the journalist, appears,
much to his horror, but is carefully smuggled
away as the Princess enters. Gormani re-
cognises the Princess as an old Jove, but
Sheen does not let this interfere with busi-
ness, and he arranges a sum as loan on the
pearl which leaves him a percentage sufficient
to satisfy a political land-speculator. The Princess
is lumbered into another room as her husband ap-
proaches, and in her hurry leaves the pearl in its
case behind a screen. Mary then emerges, collars
the pearl, swears that Sheen shall never give it to
the Princess, and clears out with it- Lillicarp, the
bailiff, then makes an unwelcome appearance, and
to get rid of him Sheen gives him the case from
Which the pearl has been taken. Then the bailiff
is arrested for a crime in Russia, much to the
trouble of Sheen, who fancies that he has the
jewel. The plots grow thicker. Sheen, the mil-
lionaire, wires for rooms at the hotel where the
Other Sheen is staying, and suspicion is directed to
the adventurers. Some arrests, an Infernal
machine, the discovery of the pearl, and some re-
cognitions compose an exciting and effective
climax. There are several bushels more of the
plot, but that is about enongh to tell you
at one sitting. As the impecunious journalist,
one Anthony Sheen, Mr. Dam pier was cer-
tainly successful in a manner which went
beyond Ibis friends’ most sanguine hopes; and
Mr. Harry Leston, as the Irishman, Patruoio
Gormani, treated the audience to a character
I study which was replete with the most delightful
humour. Indeed, all through the piece, these
gentlemen contrived to keep the audience on the
grin, and their success in the characters allotted to
them is of a peculiarly emphatic description. A
remarkable figure in this farce is a Russian police
officer, quite 7ft. feet. Mr. Dampler discovered
hitn some months ago,and has kept him locked up
in a clock-tower ever since. Like most giants, ate
has a decided tendency to be laconic, and he does
not approach much nearer to fervid declamation
than touching bis hat and grunting. Ivan is the
name allotted to him, and we should not be sur-
prised if he drew the whole town. For, mind you
thls-he is a real giant.
• m •
“The Great Pink Pearl,” being a very
slight piece, it is to be regretted that the female
element is not a little more vigorous. The “crack”
part is played by Miss Florence Wade, who, it
seems has also the colonial right of the piece
This lady’s Princess Pennikoff is a performance, in
lur opinion, that cannot be otherwise regarded
bah as disappointing, when we consider that she
omes to us with even more flittering credentials
ban those which Henrietta Petowkor took to
»ortsmouthl And, added to this, Miss Wade has
een it all in London I As Prince Paul, Mr. Alleyne
ras highly satisfactory; and the same must cer-
alnly be said of Mr. J. Btark, who was particu-
arly diverting as Lillicarp, a bailiff. And Miss
lulla Merton gave us a reproduction of Mrs.
Bouncer, with which the gods were vastly enter-
ained. Miss Lily Dampier put a lot of life into
ffary Turner; but Miss Bmma Fischer gave a
irearlly stereotyped Impersonation of the lodging-
iouse “slavey.”
• • •
The scenery is suitable, and from a
iterary point of view, the “ Great Pink Pearl” is
luperlor to any farce that has been produced here
for a very long time. There is no need, therefore,
for the actors to gag. We speak this advisedly.
* • •
The Governor came just before the second
iot, and, as he took his seat, his Excellency im-
pressed us as being very full of the bares of State
-or of veal. Lord “ Bob ” was accompanied by
•our Queen of Beauty,” the inevitable but graceful
Miss Judith, a young man whom the management
*ave forth was Lord Cople, and some other war-
riors. A new departure was, however, made in
respect to the orderlies. These gentlemen did not
get in on the nod as usual, but were sent back
with the carriages, having expressed A cc quo Von
dit a disinclination to “ part their ochre at the
doors.
»* m »
“La Perichole ” is running at Sydney
Opera House, and, in point of attendance, seems
likely to be a boom of almost the sanab dlffienslors
as “ Girctle-Girofla ” It is said that Harding and
Searelle advanced on the road to » (licence at the
rate of £2OO a week wh«,n the latter opera was on,
which goes to show a whole lot of things, and,
especially, that Grade Plaisted has managed to
walk several miles into the tffections of a discri-
minating public. By the way, it is nothing short
of marvellous to notice the celerity with which
little ladies do grip the very roots of the great
heart of manhood. They can’t help it, some-
how, and they don’t seem very oiten to want to
help It, either. On the stage, especially, a
msiden of heavier mould has not an out-
side ghost of a show with them in the
way of making the audience enthuse. A sik-foot
virgin may have art enough to stock a gallery and
sufficient stocking area for a sheep-run (joke
bore); but even then, if a four-foot fairy waltzes
on in a bunohed-up dress, and a sfblld, she knocks
the big ’un out in one round, and monopolises the
opera-glasses for the rostof the evening. We have
always had a suspicion bordering upon certainty
that Helen of Troy could not muster more than
about six stone avoirdupois; that Sappho was only
about knee-high to an emu; that Cleopatra
was a gushing little thing of less weight
than Deb. O’Connor’s last ovation; and that
Potiphar’s wife—but this is wandering from the
subject. Grade wears two very fetching dresses
as La Perichole. In the first and last act she sports
a costume of various-coloured silk done up in
stripes like a reefed rainbow, and made very
bouffant all round, and her court costume is more
gorgeous than anything we can think of Just now,
and almost as striking as the spelling of Abigail,
MP. In this operetta her voice in subjected to
less continued strain than in *' Olrofie,” but finds
full scope, nevertheless, and encores are notun-
frequent, The popular “Oh, dearest, believe
when I swear,” and “ I’m a little bit tight ” are
good for a second edition every time. C. H.
Templeton makes a slightly too thoughtful Vice-
roy for cur money; if be were to model himself a
little more on the Carington pattern now, he
would he certain to give, not pleasure alone, but
absolute ecstacy to all. Biwin Lester is not so
prominent a figure in this piece as in its predeces-
sor, and naturally the joy is not so Intense for that
reason; he gets through his business thoroughly,
and therefore successfully, but he doesn’t, so to
speak, slop over with wit. The three cousins will
probably do better when they have been longer in
the trade. They skip about as though they Hked
it, and laugh whenever they feel that way. J. H.
South made up so well for the old mar, that many
ignorant persons were prone to imagine that he is
not beautiful even when unadorned—an error
Ilch a single view of him when attired in his
re clothes would at once and effectually dissi-
;e.

?he Federal Minstrels, at the Academy of
sic, entered upon their third year in Sydney on
urday night, and a splendid house assembled
celebrate the fact,'and incidentally to listen to

g weary years have we been writing adulatory

es with which to accentuate our encomiastic
nments. It is no use trying. This kind of
ng can’t las' - . Either our chief must get a new

tea to tailors about that little bill)—to proceed

Art is long, and when coupled with beers
similar description, the combination should be
nply irresistible.’ This was not the case, though,
the Sydney Olympic, on Saturday night,
issibly for the reason that the only art visible
audible was of the most superlatively abbre-
ated description. It was a brilliant idea on the
irt of the Vital Spark Combination to make a
rt of shandygaff of the alleged entertainment by
eluding wit and whisky, songs and sodawater,
ccalism and eau-de-vie in the same ticket. The
ily error they fell into was in forgetting to
ake the business equal to the beer, and so it
ippened that the refresament interval was a long
ay the most enjoyable item on the programme,
iss Bella Sutherland, the Vital Spark, was
lowed the biggest capitals on the bill, but
irdly proved the brilliant success that might
%ve been anticipated by those who had not heard
sr. We have never seen a vital spark before,
id should be quite able to exist if we knew
lat we were never likely to see another. Some-
ow, vital sparks don’t seem to fly upwards in
ur estimation. Fred. Dark, who has made a
ame at this classic hall, put in good business, and
tarry Power did about all that was expected of
im, but Mr. Reece was, like unto a member of
aat celebrated Night'ngsle Club, "where the
ingers no doubt would have greatly excelled
ad it not been for the want on their part of all
be attributes necessary to successful vocalism,
[r. Glenvllle was above the average, but still the
urore he created was strictly limited in its inten-
Ity. And yet with all this we did not like to hear
n angry critic say that “if they only gave four
eers instead of one, they might keep their blasted
nter tain men t.” Buch remarks as these betoken
he presence of a mental condition which falls to
oar above the level of liquor. It is possible that
ha vital one will make things hum In the future,
iut we are almost inclined to fanev there is a re-
note possibility that she won’t. The chief point
n her favour is that very few persons are capable
critics of music and the drama, while, on the other
mad, anyone can appreciate bottled beer.

The news about George Darrell is cheer-
ng. He played to full houses for seven weeks in
iuokland, and then " fetched ” Wellington for
ihrea weeks. He followed the 11 Private Secre-
tary ” to Christchurch, where hejopened on Bt.
Patrick’s night. (The New Zealanders take George
tor an Irishman. The way he makes love to Annie
Mayor in “ The Sunny South ’’ is now established
is a standard for imitation by the swains of Maorl-
land.) Christchurch gave him an ovation. He is
there now, but is getting ready to salute Dunedin,
whence ho will, after enlarging his bank balance,
pay Invercargill a visit. On leaving Invercargill
he will sail straight for Sydney. Some day De-
tween the 15th and 120th May Ithose happy enough
to be about the Circular Quay w.ll behold him in
his yacht sailing up our oeautlful harbour and
leaning on the velvety arm of the still more beau-
tiful Joe Brown.

Fortune’s favours again. At Akaroa

named Sloane in the breast-pocket, collided with a
two-shilling piece, and glanced off without doing

There Is a report from N. Queensland that
the Johnstone blacks have eaten four Chinamen
in 11 months. Well, the choice of these ebon lords

to blame these heathens much. And We are, let us
tell you, an authority. For we've hem very hungry,

At Dalton, 8. A., a volunteer named Simms

More muddle. From a recent Sydney
Evening News we learn—“ A middle-aged m<m,
named Alfred Collett, was observed by a constable
to throw a stone at some boys who were sitting
on a wall at Dawes Point. The stone struck a lad
named Thomas Brown on the back of the head,
and|cauaed a compound fracture of the skull. The
deceased was committed for trial.” If this is the
style deceased persons are treated, Ninny Mel-

A little taste of gall from the Cooktown
Independent:—“Our aldermen are doing their
best for public interests according to their brains

magnates will be of about as much use to the

With sorrow we have observed that the

last in Melbourne. A gentleman of colour was
summoned to show cause why he had not paid a

CHARITY CRICKET.
We don’t mind admitting that when we
first saw the ** Ladies’ Cricket Match ” advertised,
we entertained considerable doubts as to whether
we should enjoy ourselvcSby going there. Darkly
iooming in the storehouse of our recollection was
the “ Ladies’ Tournament,” In which a woman who
kept a fish-shop, and a lady who drove a van, had
the race between them “ from the jump,” the
former female coming in a winner after a six
< ays’ contest, a raddled and degraded spectacle |
but yet clothed, as the management of the tent
would persistently have it, “in chaste and appro,
priate attire.” We remember us, too, having
recently been present at a “ ladies’ footrace ” at a
picnic. This Impressed us as being but a melan-
choly spectacle—the display of “lasting” boots
and wrinkled stockings being calculated to
dispel from the mind of man, for once and
for ever, thoughts that a romance surrounds
even women who go to picnics, and take
part in foot-races with enlosaal boots and de-
fective garters. As a matter of fact, we don’t
like to see women assert themselves. We have
seen all the circus women who go up a rope and
curl round a trapeze-bar, but the performance Las
always Impressed us as being hideous in its ungrace-
fulness. Similarly a circus woman on horseback
what a sorry figure she cuts! She never, by any

A Divorce Bill Difficulty: An Innocent Absentee.
In the N.S.W. Legislative Council, Captain Charles “pointed out that a man might be away from his wife for over three years withsut any desire to desert her There were
instances often occurring of men being shipwrecked on desert islands, and bo forth, and being unable to return to their wives and families before the expiration of several
years,"
febanoe doesianything she is supposed to do, and,
as she passes your side of the ring, you hardly
know where to look.

We are bound to set down, however, that
the performance we witnessed at Sydney Associa-
tion Ground, on Monday last, was strictly within
the bounds of propriety. And to It was relegated
the additional advantage of possessing many fea-
tures of a delightfully ludicrous nature. The two
competing elevens were the Siroeeos and the
Fernleas; and it had been arranged that the gate-
raoney should go to Mr. Ardlll’s charities—“ The
Ome of ’Ope,” and the “ Open all Night Refuge.”
The ground was given free, and as, towards the
afternoon, the people rolled up to a surprising ex-
tent, we should conceive that by ibis time the
Home contains more hope than it boasted before,
and that the Refuge is open more “ all night” than
ever. We started after lunch, and were much dis-
concerted at finding the tramcars full of members
of the dramatic profession. Our spirits recovered
somewhat, however, on our arrival at the grounds,
a discussion arose between a number of
alented exponents of the drama, and the editors
®f the turnstiles, on the subject of parting the
necessary Robert. One gentleman, well known
or his low comedy powers, declined, In so many
to “part;” and, as he walked away, said
■whi I!® ® efuBed to patronise an entertainment In
loh the finest feelings of human nature were
vhus outraged.
I'be admission; bons'idering the amusement
afforded, was reasonable enough, goodness knows i
A shilling to the ground and a skilling to the
Grand Stand seems dirt-cheap when about every
five minutes you saw half the field fighting for d
catch at short-slip; and heard the derisive Jaufehter
of the batswomen. We got thfere just as the
Siroccos were about half through their first
innings. The costumes of this team were “ cardi-
nal and blue,” and that of the Fernldas “ black
and gold”; but we must award to the former team
the palm for ‘‘chasteness of attire.” The Pernleaa
exhibited an independence of spirit in the selec-
tion of their garments which has been noticed
amongst many prominent members of past Aus-
tralian elevens; but we chronicle, with much
pleasure, that the young ladles did not so far
emulate the example of “the little stonewaller”
and others, as to have had the hat passed round.
The pavilion, by the way, was almost desertel, the
girls themselves preferring, when at leisure, to
disport themselves on the Grand Stand, apparently
unconscious that their feet encased in india-rubber
shoes afforded but a gloomy spectacle.
♦ ♦ ♦
The Sirooeos had the best of it all through,
the two Miss Gregorys, when at the wickets, com-
pletely demoralising the Fernleaa. Neither of
these young ladies ever attempted to block any-
thing, but “swiped ” all before them with sur-
prising freedom, and had three out of every fl ve
balls in the gutter at the fence, at every over.
The Fernlea's fielding was of a very feeble descrip-
tion. They never caught any ball they ran after;
and if a girl saw an easy patch coming she would
put her hands up to the ski ,s a yard apart, and
while she was Invoking the aid of Providence, miss
it. It was a pleasant thing, however, upon that
afternoon, when there was a ccol and i pplng
breeze, to watch the game, in which there was a
laugh every 10 seconds. Ic wasn't, however, so
pleasant as to descend into a cellar beneath the
Grand Stand, and obtain refreshment, from a
familiar waiter, at a plank on tressels. There was
a tray of sandwiches down there on an upturned
cask which we saluted with much emphasis. Real
sporting provender this J Never misses either an
athletic gathering, or a race meeting.
• * *
There were a whole lot of pleasant-looking
people in the Grand Stand; though, as may be
imagined, they carried on their conversation in
partially subdued tones, owing to the departure,
on the morrow, of society's bright particular star,
Mr. R B Smith! One society item took place,
which we distinctly remember, A stout lady in
black satin, while promenading, happened to step
on our foot. We immediately begged her pardon.
“ Don’t mention it,” she rejoined, with a pleasant
smile.

The Permanent Artillery Band struck wp
at about half-past 3, but being much interested in
the sport; only perforated in a furtive and Irre-
gular manner. Their tempo, we noticed; too, was
on occasions defective. This we remarked to a
performer. “ Well,” he replied, “ I can’t help it;
± blow into the d—-d thing as hard as I can.”

Tom Nunn and Nat. Thompson, two
cricketers of intercolonial fame, made a ‘ duck”
each last Friday in a match at Sydney between
Carroll’s team and 11 “coppers.” The match was
going agalqst the “foorce,” whereupon their
stalwart skipper disputed the umpire's decision,
and the other side not giving in ho; knocked the
stumps out of the perpendicular, and the proceed-
ings came to an unceremonious end.
A Tuesday’s cablegram states that the

The complimentary banquet last Monday
night at Aarons Exchange Hotel, Sydney, to Mr.
R. Burdett Smith, M.L.A , seemed, from the tenor
of the speeches, to have been inaugurated for the
purpose of bringing special pressure to bear upon
the guest, so as to Induce him to get married.
During the evening almost frantic appeals were
made to him to worry up a wife in England and
bring her back with him. Dan. O'Connor even
going so far in the generosity of the moment as to
promise to “ dance the first set of quadrilles with
her” Immediately on arrival; but to all the appeals
our beau ideal of mauly beauty only returned a
smile that migbt mean anything, and a blush that-
in the (Stimauon of all was portentous of
something, though no one knew exactly what.
It was a thoroughly good-humoured affair.
Burdett himself was wreathed in happiness,
Sir John Robertson was jovial, as is his wont;
Mr. Wisdom smiled, with a comprehensive-
ness that spoke volumes tor the state of his
digestion; and Harry Levien readied up several
really new jokes specially for the occasion. The
only peroeptioie jar was when Alphabetical Bailey
insisted on charging the A.S.N. Company with
diddling” a Spaniard out of £5OO, an allegation!
which Mr. Dibbs insisted on denying in plain andi
unvarnlsned terms, Mr. W. Bradley, in respond-
ing for the ladies, took advantage of the occasion,
to speak to the young men present on the neces-
sity of early marriages, and crowded more em-
phatic advice on the subject into his 10-minute'
oration than Dr. Jefferis can belt out of < he same
theme in an hour, but as Mr. Bradley inadvertently
admitted that he had 13—or 2t, we forget exactly
which—daughters of his own, his earnest counsel
was taken cum gram salis. Mr. Bennett spoke
volubly In proposing the “ Parliament,” and if he
had only infused just a trifle more variety Into
nifl oration ho m got have secured an oven more
marvellous success than he did. Whv the band
should have played ‘Cheer, hoys, Cheer, your

we were at a loss to understand-unless Indeed 1c
was thought that as Messrs. Nt lid and Abbott have
lately,been washing so much dirty linen the-r,

letters from Sir Alfred Stephen and Sir James
Martin, but as those eminent lawyers both re-
gretted that they were not able “for to be
present we are prone to believe that though the
name was Martin’s name, the words were the
words of O Connor. Mr. Burdett Smith may well
be gratified at the success of the aff air, and it they
did give him a little too much chaff that, alas I has
alwas been his portion. Yale ! Burdett

His Royal H. was out of town,

It made no odds to Bertie.
A person in the purple born

The matter gave him no concern—
It made no odds to Bertie.
They might be crying out for bread
And daily waxing thinner,
But he, thank God I is nicely fed—

They went on starving all the same—

Now, Walter was a soldier man,
He answered Dailey’s call,
And sailed away for the Soudan
To like a soldier fall;
He was among that honoured few
Who made the trip abroad,
And ever draw their daily screw
But never drew the sword.
In battles with the potted-meat,
And charges on the bread,
Our Walter never knew defeat—
The van he always led;
While we were sitting at our ease,
Or loafing in a pub..
He on his knees, across the seas,
Was fighting with the grub.
Alasl that we should have to tell
A narrative so sad I
A very fearful fate befell
This noble soldier lad;
’Twas not that any blood was shed,
(Save gravy on his plate)
But obi the sun above his head
Affected Walter’s pate.
Pray ponder well, then William D.,
• The mischief you have done.
How many heroes may there he
Whose mental course is run?
Though Walter’s limbs may still remain
Intact, this poor young man
Has left his little bit of brain
Behind in the Soudan.
Each time he takes a lager beer,
Or little drop of rum,
Poor Walter weeps a silent tear
To find he’s overcome;
And bitter is his cup of woe—
He wishes he were dead—
Since, though his body faced, the foe,
The climate turned his head.

Judging from a last week’s cablegram,
General Prendorgast, over in Burmah, is running
Lord Wolseley close with soft things in the way
of slaughter. This reads like a real picnic for the

the road to Yemethen. In the engagement whlol
ensued, the enemy lost 60 killed, and many
wounded, the British loss being slight
A lot of poor undersized heathen
They went on the road to Yemethen,
When up came the Britons
As lively as kittens,
And left very few heathens a-breathin’.
As for that British loss being “slight,” we d bet our
bottom dollar that there were only two or three
cases of overstrain, resulting from sticking too
many Burmese in the back while they were bolt-

The Jingoes are on the rampage in Vic-
toria. The “Australian Natives Association"
(which, when you come to think of it, has no
raison d etre except for the puryose of breeding a
certain enmity between classes) is busily engaged in
preparing protests against anybody—except Aus-
tralia—annexing anything. Despairing, though*
of awakening the Home Government to the
horrors of our position, one “ Australian Native ”
has published a spirit-stirring “ Appeal ” in the
Melbourne Hhbald. A short extract will be
suhieient to show that the blood of his British
ancestors still courses through the veins of this
irrepressible Native:—" Every boy and man in the
colonies she uld be steadily trained to arm a, and
taught that those who establish outposts around
his native land are his natural enemies.” When
such rot as this is published in a paper without
any footnote to explain that the article is a joke
(or paid for) things are going too far. In this year
of grace we had fondly hoped the thrice-damned
doctrine that Frenchmen and Germans are
“ Native’s ” natural enemies because their respec-
tive Governments have adopted the English sys-
tem of annexation was dead and done with. The
notion of training such fiery natives as this >“ to
arms ” la quite appalling. When all the Herrs and
Monsleurs were blows to atoms we should be hav*
ing civil war, or-raore likely-a massacre of the
new chums.
Beaoia, the champion oarsman, has been
witching the Melbourne people with his matchless
oratory. At all times fluent of speech, William
rose to a Demosthenesian height in addressing the
bicyclists—“l think it a great honour to be
amongst such a dolly lot of sportsmen. Bicycling
is one of the greatest sports I know of. I believe
in all kinds of manly athletic sports, which, I be-
lieve bicycling to be. But I am no great judge
of bicycling,” &c., The champion had been
worked up to an unusual pitch of enthusiasm, you
must remember, or the chairman, after drinking
his health, suggested that the company should
smash their glasses, so that mortal lips might
never profane them more. The countenance of
Beach, while this work of destruction was in pro-
gress, expressed unqualified joy. In the words of
a Herald reporter, “ he was greatly pleased with
the incident.” At that blissful moment no dark
misgivings crossed his muscular mind. But the
time may come—ah! Pass the banjo—
LEAVING THE SHELL.
Jehoshophatl good gracious I pass us down the
tambourine;
So that Exhibition really will be opened by the
Queenl
Old England’s royal ruler, if the papers rightl
tell,
Will for this occasion kindly quit the precincts o
her shell.
Y. will promenade (in person) down the centre o
the hall
(What joy for Graham Berry and what happiness
for Saul!)
Declare the building open and then catch a specia
train
Which will bear its weary burden back to solitude
again.
Oh, hush all harsh complainings—let no vulgar
scoffer say
That our gracious Queen does little In proportion
to her pay;
That she shirks the slightest trouble, save in put-
ting by the pelf.
And let ministers make journeys which she ought
to make herself.
For. all things now considered, such remarks aro
out of place.
On two or three occasions has she lately shown her
face;
She went in state to Parliament and now, Jehosho-
phatl
Will attend our exhibition, yea, in person— think
of that!
And when the hungry multitude was almost at her
door,
Did not our Sovereign Lady give a “ monkey ” to
the poor ?
From this and other incidents, whereon we cannot
dwell,
We venture the assertion that she’s coming from
her shell.
Now can it be that Gladstone thought it best to
give the “ tip •
That a nasty storip is brewing, meaning danger to
the ship;
And that on the troubled waters she must pour a
little oil,
’Stead of sitting in her cabin calmly counting up
the spoil ?
'Tis probable. But we, her far-off subjects in the
South,
Will not be so ill-mannered as to scrutinise the
mouth
Of this latest royal gift-horse—let u?, therefore,
merely say
That the Queen appears in person on the blessed
4th of May.
A FRAGILE WAIF.
Neath the pall of the dark dead day,
In the misty rain and sleet,
A daughter of Eve had tripped by the way,
And lay prone In the cheerless street.
Her thin pale lips were clenched,
Her llowlng hair was damp,
And fell on her cheeks like marble blenched,
She wasn’t a common tramp.
Her weary eyelids fell,
And the silken lashes lay
Like golden bars, so she could not tell
If ’twere night or the bright noonday.
You ask why she lay there,
A waif and a stray, by the wind
Blown thither, an object of vulgar stare,
Who knows whom she left behind ?
But one there was, whose heart,
In all the pitiless crowd,
Forbade him to act the Levite’s part,
So his head o’er her own he bowed*
In his brawny arms her form
He raised with a pitying sigh
And bore it to where the lights gleamed warm
In a mansion that stood hard by*
“ Phwat’s the charrgc,” said tji'e portly host,
As he opened the grease-grimed sheet,
Said the Bobby, proceeding his buttocks to
toast,
“ She was spachless and dhrunk on my beatl”
EVANESCENT FAME.
Three little years ago. Bill Beach,
How little did you dream
Such honours lay within your reach I
As you rowed down the stream
You never ventured. Bill, to boast
Your name would be a people’s toast,
A sentimental theme. •
But now you roll in boundless wealth
And have a right to “gas,”
For when admirers drink your health
They chuck away the glass.
That none therefrom again may drink;
Say, William, did you ever think
These things would come to pass?
We call to mind when Hanlan came—
’Twas but the other day—
Men carried on the same old game;
And, Bill, we humbly pray
Your luck than his may better be,
And you may never live to see
Your glory fade away.

Sir Patrick Jennings is nothing if not an
administrator, and we would humbly suggest that
in tnat role even he can’t fee considered a pheno-
menal success. This opinion is held by the Civil
servants who had to wait three days‘for their
money this month, because es it is alleged Sir

Mr. Foster, M.L.A., during the debate in

Queen Victoria receives the money, but the work
is never performed. Even if it were* the payment

The Queen is paid, and her palaces are maintained

This torturer for ever, sir.
Of some dull, weary platitude,

How dare he have an “ attitude ”?
THE ANACONDA.
la the woods of Central America a creature
exists wmch Is known as the Anaconda. This is a
serpent of enormous size, which crushes a baffalo
or a deer within its folds as easily as a man with a
patent set of nature’s dentistry cracks a walnut.
Its breath is poison to all human being's who come
within its mlluence. It is one of those terrible
and revolting creatures which typify evil, and
which, to use Wordsworth’s words;—
“ One Impulsive from a vernal wool
May teach you more of man,
Of moral evil and of good,
’I han all the sages can.”
Surrounded by all the luxuriance of tropical
vegetation, this horrible creature, perfect in Its
hideousness, stretched along a limb of some gigan-
tic tree, waits placidly for its victims. These
browsing in unconsciousness of the presence of
danger, or haply frisking merrily upon the sward,
are suddenly gripped in deadly toils, crushed
beslavered, and swallowed.
This is, surely, a practical picture of evil. One
might well consider that this creature, the Ana
cpnda, is an embodiment of the Satan, of whom
Milton wrote
”So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear
i Farewell remorse; all good to me is lost,
Evil be thou my good.”
We can best recognise evil id this practlca
aspect. But, alas I evil sometimes encompasses the
wisest man, and gathers him within its tolls ere he
knows it, and when he knows it, all to late. Mora
—dlsesS3 creeps upon a man as surely as physioa
ailment, and
‘‘Evil Is wrought by want of thought,
As well as want of heart.”
Weil, then, if. it for him who guards against the
approaches of the foe—assured that only by keep-
mg his physical sy ,t-<m wholesome, he can main-
tain his mind and spirituality uncorrupted. The
Anaconda of disease awaits us at every turn. We
never dream of its presence until, perhaps, too
late, and when gathered irrevocably in its toils
Take, for example, Bright’s disease of the kidneys-
the vlctum knows nor What ails him I often, Indeed
his medical attendant is unable to diagnose his
case—setting it down to exhaustion, dyspepsia,
ordinary kidney troubles. The characteristic of
Bright’s disease is that the victum is all alonir
ignorant of the dire peril which threatens him.
He sees not the terrible Anaconda. He feels
languid, loses liesh and weight, is miserable and
hipped, but thinks that a few ordinary tonics will
put him straight. Miserable delusion I Mr. John
Water worth, of 63; Dargham-straet. Lyndhurst,
Sydney, knows better. He says that “ during the
last eight months of 1883, 1 was laid ap. I suffered
the greatest agony—pains in my scrotum and down
the inside of my thighs, across my back, up my spine
—ending in frightful headaches. My urine was
thick and muddy. I had no rest-nelther In bed
nor out of it. I tried several physicians, who all
told me I was suffering from a severe form of
Brignt’s disease, and one doctor advised me to go
into tno hospit&Jy ss I eould not possibly live thotg
than a few months. A friend of mine sent me a
cutting from an American paper, concerning
Warner s safe cure, a medicine which had cured I
person suffering from this dread disease. The
symptoms described were like my own, and I
wrote at once to H. H. Warner, of Kochester, New
York, XT. S, A., and received a reply, telling me to
send to San Francisco for the cure. This was. of
course, before the establishment of the laboratory
in Melbourne, which was done in May,lBBs. I am
rejoiced that this Invaluable medicine may be now
procured in the colonies. I procured a dozen
bottles from San Francisco, and was cured. I was
freed from palp, and have now sound health, and
have gained 35 lb, in weight, working hard at very
laborious occupation every day. Unhesitatingly
I recommend Warner’s safe cure.” Many who
read Mr. Waterworth’s testimony will, perhaps,
recall their own inexplicable sufferings. They
will be wise if they follow his example, and appeal
to a remedy which has been weighed carefully,
and has not been found wanting. The most pre-
judiced and obstinate must yeild before evidence
which is based upon a grateful experience, and
which is the utievaace of ore who has been
snatched from 1140 .liaconda pf disease.

SOCIALS
One of the most pleasing features in the
life of H.E. the Governor of N.S.W. and Lady
Carlngtoa since their arrival in the colony has
toeen the large seale anl frequency with which
they have sought to extend their hospitality and
become acquainted with the people amongst
whom their lot is cast. Lord Cariagton has more
than once stated that his objeot is to reconcile
rather than to extend oliquism, and following the
example of.the Heir Apparent, he recognises that
the social platform is no longer restricted as in
the last generation. If this be so in London, how
much more have the barriers been broken down
in Sydney I To some narrow-minded and essen-
tially colonial snobs this freedom is objection-
able. Mrs. A., whose social greatness exists
mainly in her own fancy, but whose husband has
an oflic'al position, cannot tolerate that Mrs. B , a
star of greater magnitude in many res-
pects, should be for a moment on the
same footing; that Mrs. C., of whose immediate an-
cestors history Is now compulsorily silent, should
occupy a seat in the drawing-room at Govern-
ment House, side by side with Mrs. D„ whose
parents have by industry and frugality laid by a
larger sum of money than has attended the C.
family; and that the daughters of the D. should
In beauty, grace, and accomplishments eclipse the
C. stock, isK unpardonable. Consequently, there
are in certain circles several storms in several tea-
pots. A remedy is to bo found, and, according to
gossip, four dames were to be selected to stand
sponsor for those who should be entitled to pass
the Government House portals. One of the four
resolutely declined to join the alliance, so another
was substituted, and their poor heads are busy
settling how the attack shall be made; for, to their
credit be it recorded, these ladies, whose indig-
nation has grown so hot, are rather awed when
the idea of suggesting to Lady Caringtoa
that she must weed the ran Vs is put before them
as an imperative duty. Rumour has it that one is
to be the spokeswoman, and that until she has
found courage or audacity sufficient to express
her ideas in words the others will stay away.
Within the past week the daughter of one of the
selected four explained to a friend that until Lady
had found an eppartunlty of Inform ng Lady
Carlngton how very mixed the gatherings at
Government House were becoming, and had pro
perly remonstrated with her ladyship, the youth-
ful speaker and her relatives must absent them-
selves. Poor Lady Cariogtonl she may well be
puzzled to understand the number and degrees of
relationship between the vast family of-well,
never mind—some member of which Is for ever in
her presence; but no one who has met the wife of
the Governor can, for a moment, doubt what will
be her answer, backed by the opinion of her hus-
band should any Individual presume to tamper

At Lady Cariaiton’s last afternoon recep-
tion, the attendance was smaller and tho costumes
much more sombre than usual. Lady Carlngton
wore a pretty gown of pale blue shade, with light
bonnet, ornate with plumes, to match the dress;
Mbs Harbord, a pure white lawn, and a becoming
high straw bonnet trim-red with maiz?-coloured
ribbon and flowers ; Mrs. Professor Gurney, a
shot-striped ill*; Miss Gurney, a rich gQlden
brown sheeny silk, with bonnet to match; Mrs.
M'Quade, a quiet but stylish looking dress of
brown gros-grain; Lady Jsnnings, in black lace;
Miss Jennings, cream, with vest and sash of crimson
silk; Mrs. 8. A. Josmh, black, very handsomely
beaded; the Mjs.is Darley, in cream; Mrs. Sydney
Burdekln wore a pretty ebstume of cream, trimmed
with del blue ; Miss Clara Manning, white
tasaosilk, light blue tulle bonnet; Milk Taylors
very pretty gown was of pink delaine, with white
velvet vest; Miss Woodbouse, brown cloth, with
vsst, collar, and cuffs of plush; Miss Day, ele-
phant’s breath cloth, trimmed with velvet and
beads; Miss Watt, very stylish costume of slate
embroidered with silver; Mrs. Purves, white tasso
silk, trimmed with lace, cardinal bonnet, and para-
sol- Mies Bnid Maoarthur looked nice in white;
Mrs. George Monteflore, la irridesoent silk and
lace; Mrs. Slydark, blue; Mrs. Professor Andrews,
fawn tasso cloth spotted with brown, gmall brown
straw bonnet. The band of the Permanent Artil-
lery played la the Gat deis throughout the after-
nooQ*
The “ Pink Pearl ” and the Government
House people drew a large and fashionable audi-
ence to the Gaiety Theatre last Saturday flight.
Ladv Carlngton wore a stylish-looking gown cut
low and had her hair beautifully dressed, and a
small spray of flowers rested slightly to one side
of the head. The Governor did not arrive until
close upon 9 o’clock, when he was greeted by lusty
cheers. ,
The usual quarterly invitation evening in
connection with Boyle and Co.’s singing class,
came off on Thursday, April Ist. A good pro-
gramme was gone through, but the principal
feature was the diversification of the scale, in
which the pupils sang at first sight from the scales
several operatic airs in unison and harmony. The
proceedings terminated at 10 30.
The fourteenth Metropolitan Liedertafel
concert was given in the Masonic Hall last Mon-
day nighty and proved, on the whole, to he the
most successful ever given by the society. The
choruae", with the exception of ‘Sweet and Low,
were capitally sung; but in the exception the
voices flattened rather distressingly to wards the
finish and left an unpleasant impression. The
ouaint “Chinese March” was, of cours?, one of
the favourites, and was sung by special request.
The ‘‘lmage of the Rose,” which is really a
tenor solo with humming accompaniment, the
soloist (Mr. Callaghan) attacked too hesitatingly,
but however, soon recovered his usual self-pos-
session. and his clear voice rang out pleasantly.
The same singer gave a delightfifl interpretation
of Blumenthal’s “ Evening Song, and when he
does succeed in getting rid of certain mannerisms
which have always been peculiar to him, he will
certainly be one of our first tenors. Mr.
Gee was a pleasant surprise to all those
who. In days gone by, have oftime* listened
to and enjoyed his mustclanly singing. His voice
full and fresh as ever, and he sang ‘ The
King’s Minatrei,” and “Across the far bin* hills.
Marie.” excellsntly. Sydney sustained a severe
loss when Mr. Gee betook himself ti the oea'y
city, where be now wastes his sweetness, at least
the sweetness of his voice. After all, Mr. Allpress
strength lies In h s really capital violin-playing,
and not in his hair, as is too generally supposed.
Ha gave a remarkable exhibition of his skill in a
fantasia 8 on Scotch airs, and when his violin
sobbed out “ Auld Robin Gray ” not a few
amongst the audience were actually moved to
tears —fact. Mies Francis Baville sang rather
weU and looked charming. Both her solos were
encored, and both encores were accepted. Oae of
her encore songs was “ Tit for Tat,” which she
gave with much archness, though in a rather un-
steady and fatigued voice. Miss Gertrudw Palmer
commenced her pianoforte solo, “Andante
Splnialo and Polonaise ” (Chopin), with a finish
and grace quite surprising in so young a
performer, but got a little faulty in the
second part, but this composition is a
severe test for any player, and all things consi-
dered the young lady's performance was by no
means devoid of merit. Two instrumental quar-
tette, played bv Herren Kretachmann, widiemann,
Allpress, and Patek, wore most interesting iteme,
and were certainly amongst the gems of the con-
cert. The hall was beautifully decorated for
the occasion, and shortly after 8 o’clock Mr.
Trickett escorted Lady Carlngton followed by
the Hon. Judith Harbord, to her seat. Midway
through the concert Mr. Trickett (president of the
society) spoke a few words to the Governor and
begged him to accept on behalf of the society the
Golden Lyre. Of course he did accept it, especially
as Mis« Trickett .offered to attach it to hia coat.
And after Lord Cariogton had, in a rather subdued
sort of voice, addressed a few words to the mem-
bers of the society, the concert proceeded, Mr.
Huenerbein attended to the accompaniments with
his usual skill.

A brilliant and joyous assemblage opened
the dancing season at Arthursleigh, Bur wood, on
the 319 t March. The guests were met at the rail-
way station by conveyance?, a piece of attention
in keeping with the other efforts made by the
entertainers, Mr. and Mrs. William Beaumont, for
the enjoyment of those who were fortunate
enough to share tbe Arthursleigh hospitality.
The grounds were hung with Chinese lanterns,
which proiuced the usual picturesque effect, and
the floor was all that could be desired. The Misses
Beaumont wore black satin chenille, pink pluph,
and magnificent ostrich feather; pink satin broche
trimmed with eldelwciss lace; cardinal satin also
adorned with edelweiss; and white silk (or some-
thing)—B.—A man wrote this ]— decked with
roses, respectively. A noticeable dress was that
of Miss Devlin—a silk chenille oyer bright car-
dinal Bilk; and Miss Hill, black net skirt with satin
body of the new crushed masher shade. Just here
our notes run out, and we regret this, for there
was a lady whose name we forget in a dress whose
colour and material we don’t quite remember, and
another whose step was as light as that of the mid-
night feline, whom we should much like to men-
tion. The dew-gemmed grass was glittering in
the morning sun before the gates closed behind
the last of the departing worshippers of the waltz.

SOCIAL FIXTURES.
Nithsdale Private Social April 14.
Sydney, Wednesday.
Dear Belle, —We haven’t had a particularly
festive week; still, since last I wrote, Ufeihas
meandered atong pleasantly enough. We have
had soma nice music, enjoyable parties, and
another reception at Government Hou&e which,
however, wasn’t a very brilliant affair. The
weather was dul 1 , the people ditto, and worst of
all, my new bonnet wasn’t at all becoming, which
was enough in Itself to spoil one’s enjoyment.
Lady Ckrington, with her usual amiability, flitted
hither and thither amongst her guests trying her
very utmost to make things lively, but the
lowering clouds seemed to have a depressing
influence, and although everybody said, it was a
delightful afternoon,” they deceived themselves
and the,truth was not in them, or why were there
so many early departures? But perhaps it is too
mueh to expect these receptions to be always
successes.
It’s very aggravating to think that just as soon
as Herr Patch gets his promenade concerts into
full swing, he is compelled to change his
quarters, as the Exhibition building will be re-
quired very shortly for the “Japanese Village.
Some of our professional artistes have been very
disagreeable about these Saturday night con-
certs. They seem to fancy it is infra,
dig* to have anything to do with them;
but knowing, as we all do know, that really first-
class artists take part In the cheap concerts at
homp, this squeamishnessseoms strange. Besides,
if the audiences are mostly composed of the
respectable but less wealthy classes, the performer
Inrt expected to siffkto a "popular level, but
rather to do his level best to raise them to his.
The difficulties Herr Patek has met with and
fought against in forming this musical corps have
been Immense, but I never would have believed
his brother artists would have added to them by
refusing their assistance. I thought their souls
were too big to allow of their being obliged to so
jealously guard their dignity, but it appears I was
wrong. Madame Kellermann and a few others
have been werthy exceptions, and their contribu-
tions to last Saturday night’s concert were well
appreciated by the large audience.
Yes, we are to have a “Japanese Village” fixed
up in the Exhibition Building, but surely we
aren’t going mad again about all “things that are
Japanese,” or I pity the poor little Japs who
arrived in the Japanese man-o’-war last Monday.
What lives the girls will lead them, to besurel
They were prime favourites, I remember, when
they were in this port some three or four years
ago, and quite acquisitions in our ball-rooms.
Did you ever hear how love-making is carried on
in Japan? It’s just in this wise. When there la a
marriageable daughter in a home an empty
flower-pot enolroleti by a ring is suspended by
chains from one of the windows. Seeing
the his Japaneseship, provided he
wishes to marry the same daughter, simply places
a rare plant therein, which is considered equiva-
lent to a proposal. If he is successful in bis suit,
the young lady Intimates as much by tenderly
watering and tending the plant with her own
bands, but if he should be rejected, the plant is
hurled to the groundand Is seen the next day lying
withered and forsaken on the roadway bolow.
Well, this is all very poetical and delicate, but It
wouldn’t do at all for us matter-of-fact English,
would it? Tnere isn’t half enough detail in that
sort of oourtahio for us—indeed there isn’t. But
Japanese and Chinese are very queer about their
womankind. It seems that in former times Chinese
ladies never dreamt of wandering about the
streets, not even when attended by their servants,
but of late years things are changed, for we hear
of their business streets being thronged by idle'
female promenaders decked In flue array. How-
ever, this state of affairsjjas so scandalised some
of the Chinese officials that it is proposed to pre-
sent a petition to the Emperor, in which it is sug-
gested that these festive ladies be cured of their
peripatetic tendencies. It goes so far as to suggest
that if a woman is seen on a public street accom-
panied by her servant, the latter be arrested;
if, however, any are sufficiently audacious as to
appear alone, they will be “ run in ” and the heads
of their families will be punished in their stead.
But, further still, if the delinquents belong to the
military order, their soldier husbands or fathers
must themselves be Jloaued for the misbehaviour
of their womenklnd. What a peculiar sense of
justice the Chinese must have, to be sure I But
perhapi the hearts of their women are tender, and
the authorities being aware of this have proposed
the flogging of the hubbies and fathers in order to
make sate that the fair ones will sever again
offend. I don't think we need complain after this
of our lack of liberty of action.
I lately heard a funny tale of an old, ha—well,
old gentleman, who recently died in one of the
colonies. It appears that when a certain English
baronet proposed for the hand of the old boy s
daughter, he, with admirable caution, put him off
for a while until he had time to hire an Bnglish
detective or enquiry office to find out whether his
would-be son-in-law was really a baronet, and
what his antecedents and habits were. If only the
baronet had put a detective on the track of the
man whose daughter he wooed, in order to And all
about his antecedents and habits, bis hair would
probably have stood on end for a month. Possi-
bly the old fellow thought it high time some good
blood was brought into the family, and he was
naturally anxious to feel certain that he wasn’t
being duped.
One of the daily papers says It has been re-
quested} to state "that there is no truth in the
report, which first obtained circulation in Mel-
bourne, that the Marquis of Normanby, the late
Governor of Victoria, is aboufrjto be married to a
young lady of Sydney.” There are so many ladles
in Sydney that the individual who answers for
them all undertakes a stupendous responsibility.
The paper’s informant may be able to speak qn be-
half of a ‘ certain young lady.” But how, dear, about
that vast multitude of un certain young ladies,
who, as history makes us all aware, would accept
a coronet, even at the hands of Earl Methuselah ?
We had a nice little impromptu entertainment
in the Theatre Koyal the other night. We went
to see “ Dark Days," but our fun had nothing to
do with the play, which, sooth to say, dragged not
a little. But close by us two ladies sat, one of
them tenderly holding a beautiful bouquet with
ribbons and billet-doux attached. We wondered
who was to be the recipient of this marvel of the
florist’s art, when, without the slightest excuse
for any enthusiasm, and just In the midst of a eon-
versat'on between Vincent and his mother-in-law-
to-be, the bouquet flopped on to the stage. We
presumed the young lady's heart had gone out to
Mr. Vincent, as the njother-ln-law was quite out
of the question, but—unfeeling man I—he took as
much notice of the flowers which fell stalks sky-
ward, as my revered parent does of my applica-
tions for an increasedtillowance, indeed less, for
he didn’t even show any temper. But the thing
was so comical that the whole theatre was In a
titter for fully five minutes, and the worst of it
was tho poor flowers lay neglested the whole
evening till after the curtain fell, when either the
"big drum’’ or “trombone” annexed them—
billet-doux and all. No w, if this much-gone young
lady had been one of the lady cricketers she might
have practised a good round-armer, and sent her
flowers straight at the admired one’s head, and
thus have forced his attention to them. It would
haye spoilt hie speech certainly, and altogether
have disturbed the play, but what of that ? I felt
quite sorry for the poor lady, however, for
Sydneyites are so excessively appreciative of the
ridiculous that upon this particular night they
cou d hardly contain their mirth, and her chagrin
at not only having her gift slighted, but also to
find her act afforded so much mirth to others must
have been great indeed. But why will girls be so
silly I
The Kev. Mr. Jefferis discoursed, last Sun-
day night, on "Bachelor life.” The gist of his
discourse was that there should be no such thing
is bachelors, after a certain age, as no properly
disposed young man should abstain from marriage.
He (the rev. gentleman) holds that it isn’t desir-
able for young men to live in lodgings—they have
too much freedom and d© quite too much as they
sleese. He says there is great danger of a young
nan being contaminated by the promiscuous
laoiety he may be thrown amongst in a boarding-
louse; but now, dear, whatever sort of weak
jreatures are thess we call men if they can't keep
straight, no matter what kind of people they come
nttf Contact with ? Mr. J. says that, when he was in
London, in order to keep good and not be as other
nen are (at all events, he leads us to understand
:hat) he refused all companionship; but he didn’t
ind a solitary life congenial, and doesn’t advise
myone to follow his example. As far as I can see.
;hec, a young man, in order to shape his life after
Hr. Jefferis, must either get married or else de-
nand a guarantee of good behaviour from all his
[ellew-boardera. This latter course savours far
too much of the Pharisee for my liking; the
former, however, I must own, is sensible enough
-Indeed, I should be a traitor to my sex if I didn’t
think so, shouldn’t I, dear ?
I quite forgot to tell you that Miss Nellie Banks
las returned from London and gave a pianoforte
recital the other night in Messrs. Paling’s rooms.
3 he has won a senior certificate in London, but in
srder to become a really first-class pianist she has
heaps of work still in front of her. You remem-
ber bearing her play some years ago here at one of
Signora Fabric’ concerts and how pleased we were
with her ? But so many excellent pianists have
swarmed upon us since that we have grown to
expect something more than nice playing from a
public performer. I believe Miss Banks Intends to
practise her profession here, and I have not the
slightest doubt that she will make an excel-
lent teacher, coming as she does from one of the
best musical schools in the world.
We are getting on—we of the weaker sex, I
mean, for I hear that Mrs. Crawford, widow of
the late Paris correspondent of the Daily News,
has not only obtained the post held by her
late husband, but she has also been elected an
honorary member of the Cobden Club, of which
she is tho only female member. I really believe
men are beginning to treat us as intelligent
creatures at last. Oh, and Louise Michel has been
set free, and it is said she has improved wonder-
fully in appearance since her imprisonment, but
from what I can remember of her picture, there
was plenty of room for that. And what do you
think? She is dovotedly attached to—eats. She
had actually no less than four as prison com-
panions. and would not now part with them for
any consideration. What a queer mixture she is
to be sure 1
It was rumoured that the ladles' cricket match
was to eventuate last Thursday, and it was only
when would-be spectators reached Moore Park
and saw the ground unoccupied that it occurred
to thfetn it was the Ist of April. Too bad, wasn t
it ? I believe it was played last Monday, and I
should certainly have gone had I not been afflicted
wita that dreadful nineteenth-century complaint
—want of time. I had three calls to make, and my
dressmaker to interview, so how could I think of
the match ? Ned went, though, but he is very
auiet about it. I don’t think he quite approves ol
ladies playing cricket—says it spoils their com-
plGxions and makes them look coarse. But that £
only his opinion, you know.

A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.
Medical skill has not hitherto been able to grapple
wither check the alarming increase of liver and
kidney complaints, and thousands of persons have
succumbed to these diseases without ever having
been relieved from suffering from the first day of
the attack.
About five years since Dr. Bell, a renowned
physician of the United States, whilst treating
what was considered a hopeless case of liver com-
plaint, discovered that, by the use of a remedy
composed purely of vegetable matter, diseases of
the liver and kidneys could be cured In their worst
stages.
The doctor, who has had complete success in the
treatment of these diseases by the use of his
wonderful remedy, has now become so convinced
of its merit and value that he has decided to relin-
quish his general practice and to devote his whole
time and attention to the manufacture and sale of
his discovery.
The doctor, in placing the remedy before the
public has decided to style it “ Dr. Beil’s Liver
and Kidney Bitters.”
Laboratories are being started in New York,
London, Canada, New Zealand, BEd Australia, and
the representative of the doctor, who is now in
Sydney making the necessary arrangements, has
appointed the well-known firm of Messrs. Butcher,
Fehon, and Co., agents for New South Wales and
Queensland.
Dr. Bell is desirous of combining charity with
profit and of giving to the poor who are unable to
purchase medicine the benefit of his discovery.
Any poor person or the manager of any Hospital
Asylum, or Old People’s Home, wherein are per-
sons suffering from diseases of the liver or- kid-
neys, may. by communicating with the agents,
Messrs. Butcher, Fehon, and Co., Sydney and Bris-
bane, stating teat they are unable to pay for
medicine, such communication to be accompanied
by a certificate from a minister of the Gospel, bo
furnished with the remedy free of charge. There
is no doubt that Dr. Bell’s Bitters will become the
standard remedy for diseases of the liver and kid-
neys throughout the world.*

The first of the best-two-out-of-three
match between the six-tonners, the Sao land
Assegai, came off on Saturday over a course to
Long Reef and back, when the last named secured
a leg-in. Wh en the Assegai first arrived in By dney
waters from Victoria, where she was puttogether,
we little thought she would, 'ere the end ot the
season, show the Sao over an outside course, but
improvements by Mr. Reeks, and handling, have
done the deed, and unless Doctor Milford wins the
second event over the Manly course on Saturday
next, the Assegai will have earned the reputation
of the crack six-tonner. Should the doctor prove
sucof ssful on Saturday next, the final event will
be sailed on the following Saturday, over the out-
side course as sailed on 3rd inst.

Thursday, for the convincing ground. The men
appear so far to be in the beat of health and
spirits, and it is to be hoped their preparation will
not be overdone, for we would rather see an
amateur crew a shade on the lusty side than, weak
and overtrained.

prizes above the value of 10 guineas are to be
given at any race meeting held under its auspices
except in the case of challenge-trophies w-ioh
have to be won more than once.
* * *
We are on the eve of our cycling season,
and the N.B.W. Union might well take into con-
sideration the advisableness of following in the
footsteps of the National Union. As in sculling
circles, trophies are not conducive to tha best in-
terests of amateurism, and the fun and sport of
racing for a five guinea trophy settles down into
“ cut out the running and win at all hazards in a
quasi-professional race for a hundred'guinea
plate or a ninety-guinea Brinsmead piano.

Though it appeared in print before the
late bicycling contingent started for the Cabbage
Garden, we have not quite got ovot our hilarity
at the modest letter which aopsared in one of the
dailies over the name of one of our prominent
bicyclists, suggesting that the city should be
scoured for subscriptions to pay the expenses of
the bicyclists who visited Melbourne, and bolding
up the Intercolonial eight as an example why it
should be done. Should tV.e eight, alter weeks of
self-denial and hard work, secure a victory, they
will each receive a medal to the value of a few
pounds, in contradistinction to the wheelmen,
who went over op the pot-bunt for 100-guinea
plates and trifles of that sort.
* • ■
We hear that the president of theN.S.W.
Cyclists’ Union has resignation in his mind’s eye,
and, should the rumour prove to be correct, it is
to be hoped the bicyclists will elect as his succes-
sor a wheelman outside the trade, and one who
will uphold the amateur status in its strictest
sense.

When writhing, at the finish of last season,
under the lashings of the Association Ground
trustees, the opening of the Ashfleld Ground came
as welcome to wheelmen as a good square meal to
a starving man, and the two most prominent
cycling clubs promised to stand by it during the
coming season. Until the programmes of the
Sydney and Suburban meetings come out, we
shall not be cert»i" whether It wai the champagne
or the representatives of the above clubs who
promised to support the plucky promoters of the

a frisky lot of youngsters and require a deal of
looking after, as they have decided tbat a manager,
scorer, and secretary acaompany the team across
the Border. And such a giddy crowd the “ juniors
are, with their flowing beards and exaggerated
foreheads. What a farce, when Sydney possesses
young players now playing as good cricket as the
Hip Van AYinkle Juniors, and who In the future
may blossom into intercolonial and international
cricketers. It woul4 ho to the Interest of the
game to limit the age at which a player can take
a place in a “junior ” intercolonial team.

The Melbourne “ push V went straight for
their man “Tub Scott” as captain of ,the Aus-
tralian Eleven. Saminy Jones proposed and Evans
seconded Tommy Garietf, whose qualifications for
the position are deeldc-diy before Scott's, but the
Vlo.’s couldn’t se 1 ? anyone but a member of their
own crowd. It was brought as a point against
Garrett that it was undesirable to have a bowler as
captain, but Scott’s greatest enemy could not
urge a failing of that description against him,

The American citizens of Sydney are
making a praiseworthy attempt to popularize the

Captain Maohtll, the great English turf
celebrity, has submitted to the racing authorities
at home a proposal to the effect that in future all
jockeys who have not ridden a winner shall be
entitled to a certain allowance In the way of
weight. As everyone has not the luck of an
Archer, this might cause a little fairer distribution
of Fortune’s favours, but the inducements al-
ready held out to the boys to run “ byes ” are so
great that it seems doubtful if Captain Machell’s
suggestion is really the good thing it looks on
paper. Dark horses are continually “ ridden with
a heavy rein,” and otherwise “saved” until they
are fairly thrown ia for a big pool, and it is quite
on the cards that a dark jockey may bide his ti te
until he can make certain of making a grand coup
as well. It is stated the captain is not on the best
of terms with Fred. Archer, and it may be more
for a slap at the “ tinman ” than the Interests of
the turf that the captain tabled his proposal, i

Not much more than 18 months ago, a
poor, brow-beaten, irresponsible body, yclept the
N.B.W. Cricketing Association, had not a say, and
hatdly a cent to: Its name. Now, however, their
banking account is nearly £5OO, and they some-
times have the audacity to give a bit of a wriggle
when “ King Phil.” and Co.slton themalittle more
heavily than usual. We take no smajl credit to
ourselves for the part we have played in assisting
to this desirable state of things, and, in course of
time, we trust to see the Association Cricket
Ground entirely under the control of the body
best calculated to manage it—the Cricket Associa-

A real good one ia Smith, the English
pugilist, who recently had Alf. Greenfield beaten
to all intents and purposes when the roughs cut
the ropes, and made things lively to a degree.
Smith is a young Hercules, 33 years of age, stand-
ing sft. and weighing 13st. 111 b. in condition.
He is not at all likely to get on another match in
England, and will, no doubt, try for a match with
Sullivan, but the Yankee is not likely to fight again
with the raw ’uns, and it remains to be seen if
Smith is as good a boxer as fighter. The recent
mill came off at Maiaons-Lafltte, a pretty spot
near Paris, and exceeded in savagery and unfair-,
ness any that Bell’s Life ever chronicled. “ The
Midland men’s conduct was disgraceful in the ex-
treme.” Knuckle-dusters were used freely. Smith
was kicked In the jaw when down, robberies from
the person were frequent, and carriages were at-
tempted to be overturned. The tactics of the
roughs who sided with Sayers were repeated, and
the last hope of a revival of ring-fighting received
its death-blow when Smith and Greenfield met at
Maisons-Lafltte.

The most noticeable feature of the Sydney
Driving Park Club meeting on Saturday last was
the amount of whip used, both in the pony and
trotting races. In the former a pony was treated
to the whip almost from the jump* and had an
enraged carter treated a jibbing horse in the city
to the same amount of punishment he would
have figured at the police court on Monday morn-
ing for a certainty. In one division of the Grand
Handicap Trot one horse in particular was getting
over the ground in grand style, when the driver
thought fit to lay his whip on like the crack of a
Pistol, and, as a natural consequence, the horse
broke. Maud S. might stand this sort of thing
(although we do not suppose her driver would be
ass enough to apply it), for trot is her natural
gait, but to bring down a punishing whalebone
with a slashing cut on an outsider means 1 break.”
Sailor Boy won the Pony Handicap; Minnie won
the Maiden Trot; and All Sorts, at level money,
beat Dozy for the Handicap Trot.

Of late years Irish horses have generally
been to the lore in the Liverpool Grand National
Steeplechase, but this year’s winner. Old Joe, is
the property of a Scotch M.F.H. A good deal of
north country canniness appears to have directed
the coup, as Old Joe s name isn’t mentioned in the
quotations to hand by last mail. Too Good and
Gamecock, the second and third horses, both ran
in the interests of the Irish division. By the way,
it is possible that Fred. Archer made his debut as
a cross-country rider in the big steeplechase. Latest
advices spoke of him as likely to have the mount
on a horse called Ringlet.

Rowing criticisms are proverbially eccen-
tric, but for a real gem commend us to the Aus-
tralasian report on the Victorian eight. Here
is a specimen:—“ No. 6 is good all round; he is
slightly inclined to hang over his oar, but could
easily remedy this, and supply the length his
stroke wants by swinging further backward and
letting his shoulders fall back at the flnishi he
also works the right shoulder and elbow a tfme
awkwardly when feathering.” If a man who
rows short, hangs ever his oar, and feathers un-
gracefully is “ good all round,” we should like to
have the Australasian’s description of someone
who isn’t good ail round. But even the most
capable analysis of individual form is of little
value in conveying a notion of the collective
merit of a boat’s crew, and the opinions of self-
prophesying experts, who feel called upon to die-
cover faults and excellences not apparent to the
ordinary intelligent observer, is worth very little
in these matters. When the Oxford and Cam-
bridge crews are putting in their final prepara-
tions on the Thames the amateur critics seldom or
never fail to find the winner, whereas the profes-
sionals to a man nearly always swear by the
wrong lot. As regards the present Victorian eight
it looks a pretty good one taken all round.

Now that Mr. Hat ful of Cricket has ini-
tiated our girls into the mysteries of his favourite
game, why shouldn’t Foley start a team ot female
bruisers also ? He would only be resuscitating a
noble British pastime, if we may judge by an ad.
in the London Daily Post, 1738, which says:—
“ Whereas, I, Ann Field, of Stoke Newington, ass-
driver, well known for my abilities in boxing in
my own defence wherever it happened in my way,
having been affronted by Mrs. Stokes, styled the
European championess, do fairly invite her to a
trial of her best skill in boxing for £lO, fair rise
and fall; and question not, but to give her S’;ch
proofs of my judgment that shall oblige her to
acknowledge me championess of the stage, to the
entire satisfaction of all my friends.” I. Eliza-
beth Stokes, of the city of London, have not
fought in this way since I fough£ the famous box-
ing woman of Billingsgate 39 minutes, and gained
a complete victory (which is six years ago); but as
the famous Stoke Newington ass-woman dares me
to fight her for the £lO,l do assure her I will not
fail meeting her for the said sum, and doubt not
that the blows which I shall present her with will
he more difficult for her to digest than any she
ever gave her asses. N.B.—There will be the
diversion of cudgel-playing as usual.” It was usual
in these high-toned contests for the fair cham-
pions to hold a half-crown in each hand, and if one
of the competitors dropped a coin the battle was
given against her. This prevented halr-woolling
and scratching, and, as Alfred would say, took
well and gave,” &o.

Having safely piloted the Sydney ladies’
team over the shoals which beset beginners at
cricket, the fertile brain of the enthusiastic Mr.
F. Ironside is contemplating another novelty
wherewith to surprise and attract the patrons of

the organising of a team of aboriginal boys from
the southern part of the colony. If really in search
of another novelty he need not go so far afield as
this. Eleven Chinamen might be picked up m
George-street north, Sydney, who could be trained
in a few weeks to hold their own against Some of
the prominent junior clubs.

Kissing is manifestly the finest of all the fine
arts. History contains no record of the first kiss,
but the general belief is that unless Adam was as
homely-looking as a mud fence Eve must have
sneaked a little one from him while he indulged in
that memorable after-dinner sleep. Different
persons kiss in different ways. When the young
man in the country desires to osculate, he grabs
his lady love with the hug of a grizzly bear, and
the row that follows bears a strong resemblance
to the noise of a cow pulling her foot out of a
bog or the popping of a champagne-cork at a
Lord Mayor’s banquet. The aesthetic young city
couple do the saccharine business in a more re-
fined style, however, and, as near as we can re-
member, the modus operandi joggles along as
follows. The young male kisser, clad in
Sammerfleld’s unrivalled style, gently places
his left hand round the lair kissers waist
and his right hand at the back of ner
head, exactly over her bump of amativeness.
Tnen ho slowly tilts her chin up, or down (as the
case may be) to the proper level, while she closes
her eyes and gets her mouth into a suitable sort
of shape. He then leans over, and gently regulat-
ing the contract by pressing her head backward
and forward, administers an alopathic dose of
salutes while she sighs and feels as if she was being
waited up to heaven between two hot pancakes,
while all the little angels were pouring treacle and
honey down her back. When properly performed
we believe this is a particularly pleasing opera-
tion, but to our mind, the most delightful kiss of
all is that which a fond mother gives to her dar-
ling boy as he stands before her in all the “pomp
and circumstance” of one of Summerfleld and
Co.’s matchless suit of clothes Mothers should
experiment in this for themselves. One trial will
be quite sufficient.*

How sweet is the hardly earned slumber
Of him who e’er works for his bread.
How grateful, when midnight’s strokes number,

But awakening’s hard at the right time—
To give baby syrup of squills.
Miss Catherine Thomson, the female

hunters. She did not find the eyes gouged out of

smithereens.” 44 There was not,” she says, 44 suffi-

A modern French writer, Thibouville,
'says:— 44 A woman’s sentiment is nothing IE not
morbid. If she loves, she collects an agglomera-
tion of suspicion, jealousy, pride, manufactured
rapture, and affected melancholy, round an atom
of affection, and dignifies the result with name of
devotion. Her grief is the same. It is a com-
pound of selfishness, display, and affectation. In
only one sentiment, hate, is woman fervent and
sincere. In all else she manufactures her emotion
out of her own characteristic weakness.” We pre-
sume that these remarks only apply to French
women.
The Improver, after all, has its uses, and
unsightly though men may think it, has proved to
one lady at least that it is often not out of place,
though it may be all behind. This lady, strolling
In an American deer park, became an object of
Suspicion to an enormous stag, who with a want of
gallantry rafely found in the male animal, charged
her suddenly and with emphasis. His antlers were
aimed fairly and forcibly at her bustle, but upon
its massive proportions she relied, and her con-
fidence was not misplaced. She escaped unhurt,
but the stag Was suffocated before he could un-
twist himself.
tyae&n Victoria proposed to her late hus-
band. She presented Albert, who dared not ven-
ture to ask for her hand, with a flower. The
significance of the act was not lost upon him. He
wore a close-fitting uniform, buttoned up to the
throat—probably the poor man couldn’t afford a
Shirt—but Wishing to wear the precious gift
Upon his heart he cut a slit In his coat with a pen-
knife ana placed the blossom in it. Later on,
Albert was thanking her for the gracious recep-
tion she had accorded him, when the Queen re-
plied shyly, 44 If Indeed your Highness is so much
pleased with this country, perhaps you would not
object to remaining in it and making it your
home ? ” Etcetera.
According to Vanity Fair, what society
believes about the Dilke case is this:— 44 That Mrs.
Crawford, having given up her "indiscretion’
With Sir Charles Dilke—having. In fact, been
abandoned by him—for 11 months, was living, and
intending to Jive, as many an other has done, happy
ever afterwards with her husband in domestic
felicity and forgetfulness. But when that last
fatal anonymous letter arrived, she saw it and re-
flected. She saw that she was pursued by a piti-
less, unrelenting enemy, whom she believed to be
ao other than her mother. She felt that if, after
So long as a whole year of good conduct and desire
to atone for the past, she was not left alone by her
Baemy, she never would be left alone. She might
indeed destroy this letter before her husband saw
it—but others would reach him (as others had) at
his club or his office. It was clear that there was
no peace Or truce for her. What should she do ?
She would do this. She would make a clean
bft*ast of it, and would thus at once bring to an
end the strain she could no longer bear, and at the
same time bo avenged both on the man who had
debauched and deseited her, and also upon her
mother who was so evidently determined to hunt
her to despair and ruin. And so it was that she
told her story and told it, not merely in
bare outline, but with all the horrible de-
tails which take it outside any common story
of debauchery and desertion.” Vanity Fair
goes on to say that society doesn’t blame
Dilke so much for his indiscretion as for the fact
that when brought to book he behaved, not like a
gentleman, but like a man who had taken and
acted upon the advice of a sharp attorney with an
eye to virtuous dissenters; there was nothing
about his conduct either or the magnificent im-
pudence or of the generous assumption of blade
which in these matters society expects a gentle-
man to show. Suppose the charge to be faise-the
mere invention of an hysterical woman. In that
cose Sir Charles'duty, as a gentleman, was to go
Into the box and deny it all, to prove that the lady
was hysterical and deluded, and thus to save her
as well as himself—but her above all. As a gentle-
man It was his duty to do this-his duty
for his own sake; his duty for her sake;
his duty for the sake of her mother, whose
name had been so terribly handled In the affair.
If on the other hand, the charge was thoroughly
and completely true that DJke could not dare to
go into the witness-box to deny it, and to expose
himself to having brought against him the proms
which, in that case, would have been easily
accessible, then these would be a situation in
which his testimony could not avail either to save
the ladv or to save himself, and in which, there-
fore he could not go into the witness-box at all.
In that case the only course for a gentleman to
take was to stand wholly aside; neither to enter
an appearance nor to make a defence* but to let
the case go by default, and to suffer in silence
anv penalty that the Court might impose upon
him Moreover, society does not view with favour
anv man who, under any circumstances, puts the
fault in a case of this kind wholly upon the
woman, and refuses to bear any part of it himself.
It holds that men and women are liable to j indis-
cretion;” buc that if ever such indiscretions are
discovered, or alleged, the stronger should shield
the weaker vessel, and the man shoujd take upon
himself a fair share, and even the major share of
the blame. In connection therewith it remembers
the case of Valentine Baker, who. as it holds, did
behave like a gentleman.

energy, and do not “feel up to the mark;” if you
suffer from disease, we beg you to at once try
those remarkable curatives. They cannot, and do
not, injure like medicine. Always doing good,
never harm. There is no shock or sensation felt
in wearing them. There is no waiting a long time
for results ; electro-magnetism acts quickly,
generally the first week, more frequently the first
day, and often during the first hour they are worn
their wonderful curative powers are felt.
The mind becomes active, the nervous and slug-
gish circulation are stimulated, and all the old-
time health and good feeling come back. They
are constructed on scientific principles, imparting
an exhilarating, health-giving current to the
whole system. Professional men assert that there
is hardly a disease which Electricity or Magnetism
may not benefit or cure, and they daily practise
the same, as your own physician will inform you.
The Corsets do not differ in appearance from
those usually worn, as we substitute our fiat steel
magnetods in place of the ordinary corset steels.
They are all equally charged, different only In
quality and design. They are elegant in shape and
Ilnish, made after the best French patterns, and
warranted satisfactory la every respect. Those
who have tried them say they will wear ne others.
Most of the above applies equally to the Electric
Belt for gents.
These goods are sent out in a handsome box. ac-
companied by a silver-plated compass, by which
the Electric-Magnetic influence can be tested. If
you cannot get them in your town, we; will send
either kind to any port or railway station in New

CURATIVE
ELECTRIC
B^ILTS.
ELECTRICITY.
HEALTH WITHOUT MEDICINE.
Is obtained speedily and permanently by adopting
the safe and never failing remedy of the new mode
of treatment by Electricity, as supplied to the
human system by wearing the MAGNETICAL
ELECTH 1C APPLIANCE CO.’S genuine ELEC-
TRIC BELT, a restorer of impaired vitality and
failing health. It is an unvarying success in the
cure and alleviation of Rheumatism, Indigestion,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Paralysis, Epilepsy, Constipa-
tion, Nervous Debility, and the numerous ailments
consequent upon living in a semi-tropical climate,
and the baneful effects of malaria, which alone
are caused by the deficiency or abstraction from
the body of the all-pervading element of life-
electricity. This mode of treatment is by far the
most perfect and successful method yet discovered
(combined with perfect safety) for supplying to the
body the continuous or imperceptible current of
electricity, without the aid of chain bands or use
of acid, thus giving no inconvenience to the
wearer. They are charged ready for use, and re-
tain their full power for a considerable period.
But to avoid any disappointment by their possible
loss of electric power, and to keep the appliances
up to their original strength, we undertake to re-
charge any of our appliances at the expiration of
twelve months, free of cost. One of the special
features of this treatment is the electric corset,
which is unsurpassed by its curative properties in
all female complaints, and is of superior shape and
manufacture. Price, 10s. and 15s.
GENT’S ELECTRIC BELTS are manufactured
expressly for tropical climates, of superior mate-
rial, in the shape of a riding belt, and are very
durable. Price, 155.; special power, 30s. In order-
ing size of waist outside first garment is required.
If mailed, 3s. extra. Lung Invlgorators for the
successful treatment of all lung complaints,
hitherto without the domain of Electric Agency,
price 30s. All who have a tendency to weak lungs
should adopt this treatment before it is too late.
The appliances are adapted for local as well as con-
stitutional treatment in the form of Knee Caps,
Ts. 6d. each ; Spine Bands, 10s. Insoles—which are
invaluable for cold feet, defective circulation,
rheumatism—4s. 6d. per pair. Send size of boot,
or paper pattern of inside ; postage. Is. 6d. extra.
The public are warned against worthless imita-
tions of our goods, as the great success attending
the adoption of this mode of treatment has in-
duced other people to attempt, by so-called cau-
tions and notices, to mislead the public. Therefore
be careful to see that all goods are marked

e-rOREO IN POUR wptJi \
THERE are many men in this colony who are,
day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, through early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It is to those that this adver-
tisement is addressed. Impotence drags its victim
in its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering his existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege—
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the So-called
Remedies, but without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopeless invalid. If
such be your calamity, know that your case can
be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this invaluable Medicine, which will, in the
short space of Four Weeks, render you capable
of appreciating and Enioylng Life.
This valuable remedy affords relief, and perma-
nently, cures all who suffer from Wasting and
Withering of the Nervous and Muscular Tissues,
Spermatorrhoea, and all Urinary Deposits, which
cause incapacity and degeneracy, total and partial
prostration, and every other exhaustive derange-
ment of the system—regenerating all the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfil his most sacred obligations.
The directions are very simple, and require no
restraint or hindrance from business. Pamphlets
enclosed in each case with testimonials.
In cases at 13s , or four quantities in one, for 365.;
if by coach, 3s. 6d. extra. City and suburbs free.

Sweet are the uses of adversity; but give
us a little lemon and the shekels.
A. moderately wealthy old crank called
Edwin Thomas Bartlett, a good-looking, warm-
blooded woman of 30 his wife, and the inevitable
£ arson, the Rev. George Dyson, a Wesleyan
[ethodist, have between them managed to evolve
the sensational Claverton-street (London) Poison-
ing Case. Bartlett, the husband, was an eccentric
of the choicest order. On moat subjects he was
sensible enough, but with regard to marriage he
held that every man should have two wives, one
to be kept as itjwere in a glass case, and who should
be on a strict Platonic-affection footing with re-
gard to her “ husband,” and the other to be, as the
Rev. Dyson puts it with exquisite delicacy, re-
served “ for household duties.” He began matri-
mony by going through the rite in 1873
with the woman who is now in custody on
suspicion of having caused his death, then
a girl of 16. The marriage-contract expressly
stated that they should live together aa two
loving friends only—an arrangement which was
broken through but once in six years A child was
A BUSH IDYLL. —BY A BACK-BLOCK ARTIST.
He would like to learn the use of the stock-
whip, and takes a few lessons from an old hand.
“Ah, sir! I will soon teach you to crack
the whip on horseback.”
“Don’t be frightened,” cried the old
man, “he won’t bite; it is only his play,”
“Now for a mighty crack,” said he to
himself, as he rose in the stirrups.
“Look out that you don’t get the lash
round his tail, or he’ll ‘buck’!”
“Stick to him, sir, or he’ll throw you.”
And he not only threw him, but rubbed
it in.
“You have had a ‘blue-buster,’ and no mis-
take; but you will soon get used to it,” cried
the stockman.
born In ’79, which died at birth, and thenceforth the
\s
rt>m
wife again occup.ed the position assigned to her in
terms of the marriage contract. Her life from
that time seems to have been a most unhappy
one. Her husband constantly invited friends to
visit the house, and encouraged them in paying
Platonic attentions to Mrs. 8., and during 1884 that
gay young cleric, Mr. Dyson, appeared on the
scene. His visits at first were weekly, but he soon
made them tri-weekly, and at length daily, with a
Sunday supplement. At the Inquest the rev. gen-
tleman stated that he visited Mrs. Bartlett “ as a
friend, and also, of course, in his spiritual capa-
city”—hut, as a cynical counsel put it, his
spiritual visits always involved the use by
him at Mr. Bartlett’s house of a lounge-
coat and a pair of slippers. The three seem
to have got along very happily indeed, and.
iudging from the evidence, neither of the men
came in the way of the other. It was soulful,
Platonic, unsophisticated affection all round. The
jlev. George tells in his own simple language how
THE REV. GEORGE DYSON,
he frequently kisfled;Mrs. B„ the beautiful, when
her hub. was a spectator, and, “still more, fre-
quently when he wasn’t.” Mr. Bartlett, according
to the evidence, “ gave ” his wife to the servant of
the Lord, but the gift was evidently in the nature
of a bequest—not to take effect until after his
death. Little wonder that this consummation was
not long delayed. Early in December, Bart-
lett complained that he had been poisoned
with mercury, and on New Year’s Day a
doctor, who was called in to see him, found
him dead in bed. A post-mortem showed
that his stomach was heavily charged with
chloroform, several bottles of which Mr. Dyson
had obtained at different ttmes at Mrs. Bartlett’s
request. In order to get the poison the pious
George had told the chemists that he wanted it
(two ounces at a time, tool) to remove grease-
spots, and as he did not tell the dispensers that the
“grease-spot” had a very pretty wife, they
handed it out to him every time. Mrs. Bartlett in
her statement asserts that the life she led had
driven her to desperation; that her mock-marri-
age and the parson together tormented her be-
yond endurance, and that, exasperated by the un-
deviatlng strictness with which her husband kept
her to the marriage contract she had resolved in
turn to ensure herself against any attempt on his
part to set it aside, and that she carried a
bottle of chloroform as a defence against even-
tualities. New Year’s Eve she went in to talk to
him as he lay in bed, taking the bottle with her as
usual, and after talking to him for some time he
went to sleep. She also dozed at the foot of the
bed, and on awaking during the night found him
dead, and the chloroform bottle was—well, just
here the evidence is shaky, but an ounce of the
fluid was in his stomach, and as the doctor re-
marked, “It was absurd to suppose that he had
swallowed it for the purpose of curing the tooth-
ache.” Mrs. Bartlett and the genial and rev.
George are now on their trial for murder. It is
not possible to rake up much sympathy for the
parson, but in mercy to the woman it must be re-
membered that even if guilty, the act was the
consequence of a marriage contract dictated by
the victim, and suitable only for a matrimonial
union of statuary. Judging from the unfortunate
result of this “ Bartlett experiment ” it is not at
all likely that such unions will become popular in
the immediate future.
PHOTOGRAPHER: “AND NOW, MY DEARS, YOU MUSTN’T LAUGH".
Thus a French barrister recently addressed
a jury and conjured up a ghastly bedfellow“No,
gentfi men, you will not leave these precincts with-
out acquit ing my client. You will not dine
peaceably after beheading a man who is innocent.
His head will weigh In the balance of your con-
science; you will see it bleeding in your dish, like
the bead of St. John the Baptist! Like St. Louis
you will carry it under your arm I Nay, you will
see it on your conjugal pillow, between your own
head and that of Madame votre Spouse.”
Thus a Wallahallow (N.S.W.) correspon-
dent:—*' Dear Bulletin,—Just after a month’s
travel through the country around the Plains,
out to Coonamble, also west of Dubbo, to Bathurst
on to Sydney, then to Newcastle, thence here. I
have never seen things look so bad, and I am cer-
tain that if one-half of the men that are travelling
about looking for employment were in Sydney
your aristocratic toy-soldiers, the Lancers, would
have a very busy time of it. It’s terrible to wit-
ness such sad sights In such a new country.”
This is how it is reported that a junior in
the N.S.W. Universal Loaf Department got to
windward of a strategic and generally aggravating
senior. This junior had sent in an «pplication for
the statutory three weeks’ leave of absence, to date
say, from ls<; March, when his generous superior
suddenly bethought hlmselfthat he had not taken
his own regular leave in 1885, “I must have six
weeks this year,” said he, “and the sooner the
better in case the Civil Service Act is altered.” So
he sent in an application accordingly, to date also
from Ist March. The chief clerk, to whom the
senior was a persona grata, recommended the ap-
plication for six weeks, and the junior s applica-
tion was thereupon declined, although it was the
first sent in. Junior found himself in a fix, as he
girl in the country, so he resolved on a desperate
expedient. He wrote to the chief clerk pointing
out that the senior had been in the habit of arriv-
ing at the office about 30min, late every day, and
by that means he had practically been absent from
duty for a longer time thon the Act allows for
leave of absence. This stvle of argument was too
much even lor the chief clerk, and the youngster
got what he wanted, but when the question of de-
partmental retrenchment comes on it 1s much
more than probable that the ingenious young
mathematician will find himself forced to hump
his little drum to some region where his power of
staling awkward arithmetical problems will be
in higher estimation.
Says Truth (London): “Nothing can be
more ludicrous than the grovelling sjcopharey
and the abject adulation which most of the
wealthy snobs of the place (Sydney I) have dis-
played towards Lord and Lady Carington, who
have been pestered almost beyond bearing by
their feverish attentions. The new Governor and
his wife are likely to be great successes from the
social point of view, and in this respect they will
bo a decided contrast to Lord Augustus Loftus,
who was sent to Australia only in order that ne
might have an opportunity of saving money to
recoup himself for his outlay when he was Am-
bassador at St. Petersburg.” This would seem to
indicate that Truth is well informed as to colonial
affairs. “ Grovelling sycophancy and abject adu-
lation ” just about describe the present situation,
but we think that it is too much to say that Lord
Carington is pestered by this frantic social pros-
tration. He certainly was never so effusively
worshipped in his life before, and it is not pro-
bable that he ever will be again. The majority of
men take kindly to homage even of the most ex-
travagant order, and it is not likely that Lord
had arranged to spend his holiday with his best
Carington, who is known to be gratified when his
presence and actions are welcomed and ap-
preciated, is very careful to notice whether
the genuflexion is indicative of loyal respect,
or of a sycophancy assumed to bring its
exhibitor into humiliating prominence. Re-
ferring to this matter an hysterical Sydney
evening paper howis “you’re another ” in defiant
periods by accusing “the wealthy snobs of London
and proudest Tory families of England ” of
“gushing over ill-bred illiterate creatures who
could not obtain a footing in Australian society,”
and points the reference by naming Sir Samuel
Wilson as the recipient of such alleged Tory gush.
Wilson doubtless wishes he were, but, alas! it is
not so. That “representative Australian ” stands
not even on the threshold of the world of social
distinction. He has spent money freely in the
Tory cause and for that service the Tories are
cautiously grateful, but, to say that the cash has
been traded for an equivalent in the form of
society favours and fashion worship, is to assert
that Wilson has succeeded where, as a matter of
fact he has miserably failed. He may have ad-
vanced so far as to be regarded as a “wealthy
snob,” but he had acquired that amount of fame
before he ever started from a land in which he
hoped to leave all the reputation but none of the
wealth he had up to that time acquired.
One Hennessy died lately at the Adelaide
Home for Incurables. The unfortunate man had
his misgivings as to Moses and the eloquence of
Dan-we mean, Balaam’s quadruped, so the Free-
thought party claimed the corpse and trundled it
along to the cemetery, where a local apostle of
Freethought gloated for a few minutes in exe-
crable English over the fact that deceased had
then absolutely ceased to exist, that he had paid
his washerwoman close up, and had not gone back
on his freethinbing comrades in thus “hour and
harticlo of death,” as he elegantly put it. There
was then a general war-whoop around the grave
in favour of everything “free” except drinks, at
which point the orator broke squares with the
“liberal party.” After the obsequies, it leaked
out that poor Hennessy had in bis last days dis-
played a decided thirst for the spirit, as the chap-
lain of the institution put it To meet the
occasion, however, the Freethinkers had pro-
vided him with a bottle of whisky, which he
mopped up shortly before his death. It was
whilst he was languidly draining the last tot
of O.T.G. out of the bottle that he was overheard
by the matron to exclaim, “Oh, how delicious;
God help mel ’ This was regarded by the Church
party as amounting to a recantation of faith, and
they loudly declared that the corpus exsangue had
been wilfully, maliciously, and of malice afore-
thought appropriated by the disciples of Brad-
laugh, and ought to have been planted in conse-
crated ground. The atheists replied that the first
three words in the sentence applied without doubt

The new muzzle and gab alarm and patent
anti-blatherskite consists of a strong wire-muzzle
which is attached to the face of the man who has
too much of the “ Victoria Cross of public life
in other words, too much “ jaw.” This muzzle, by
means of certain machinery, is so connected with
a small bell and two steel spikes at the top of the
head, that when the gab-gifted man on the stump
has uttered a certain number of words the bell
gives a premonitory alarm. Then after a certain
number more words have been spoken, the two
spikes, which are warranted capable of piercing
the thickest skull in the N.S.W. Legislature,
descend on the head, where their pressure in-
creases until the speaker stops or dies. There is
also an attachment, consisting of a torpedo which
explodes at a certain stage in the oration, after
the alarm, and the lancets have worked in vain,
t he accompanying diagram will give some Idea of
his Ingenious and useful contrivance.
