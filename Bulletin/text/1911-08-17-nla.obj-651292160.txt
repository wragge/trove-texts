TIIE SEA HOSTEL.
O! many a brave carouse I've known, as
many a searpan may,
A-meiting of the dollars with the boys at
Negril Bay;
But, for a right good hostel for to liquor in
so free,
O, Mommer! 'twas at Alves in the shipwreck
of d Estree.
The wind was fresh, the sea was foul, ’twas
in the dark of night;
The Adm ral was a-leadin’ with his shinin or
maintop light:
AVe follers j being in consort with the fleet of
this d Estree)
And leaves it to the Admiral, who leaves it
■, to the sea... .
The Count, ’e strikes; and, for to warn us,
fires his guns so free,
We thinks as ’ow the silly swab ’ad struck
an enemy ;
So, loud we cheers, and crowds on sail, and
sweeps on through the dark—
And finds we struck a tougher ’ide nor e’er
come out the Ark!
I’ll warrant ’twas a sight to see us come
full-sail ashore,
With that there reef a-foaming, and a-roar-
mg out for more!
It munched our timbers ’earty, and it washed
em down with brine—
It ’ad no use for pork nor beef, for brandy
nor tor wine.
O! they was merry times, they was, for my
old mates and me,
As come ashore at Av&s in the shipwreck of
d Estree:
But bad they was for Frencliies; for, so
dainty they .’ad fed,
Lor’ bless my soul! they couldn't eat the
meat Without the bread.
So, some, they dies of brandy ; and lad Inch
to em! we said,
Defrauding of_ poor mariners as never asked
for bread!
But some, they starves like vermip; and
good luck to 'em! says we;
O! they was merry times, they was, for my
old mates and me.
Note.—The narrative is taken from Dampiere
who concludes:—
“There were about 40 Frenchmen on board in one
of the ships where there was good store of liquor,
till the after-part of her broke away and floated over
the reef, and was carried away to sea witli all the
men drinking and singing ; who, being in drink, did
not mind the danger, but were never heard of after-
wards.”
THE HAUNTED PIRATE.
He haunts me on the deep sea,
He haunts me on the main,
And on the green Savannah—
The man as 1 have slain.
There’s many a man I’ve done for,
There’s many a debt I’ve paid
In good round pistol-bullet,
A-following the trade.
I fought for Cap’n Morgan;
I fought at Porto Bel ;
I fought at Maracaibo;
I fought in blazing Hell!
I ain't no chicken-hearted,
I’m tough as any be. . . .
He haunts me in the fo'c's'le';
He follows on the quay.
I seen his face ... I seen it. ..
I seen it ... I dunno", . .
I dunno where I seen it,
A dim long time ago.
It worn’t on any island ;
It worn’t on any sea;
It worn’t —itworn’t in Cornwall,
AVhere firsts! come to be.. .
The old buccaneers have inspired many
good, stories and verses, and a great deal of
rubbish. John Masefield, who has written as
well as most about the whole gang of them,
recently introduced a book of Buccaneer Bal-
lads by E. H. A r isiak (Elkin Mathews, Is.),
with a note which gives reasons for the fre-
quent appearance of the Spanish Main and
its piratical inhabitants in English verse
It is not because the poets have counted
them worthy of honor, but because much
nineteenth century, poetry is the outcry of
rebels who find in the buccaneer, what no
buccaneer ever had the wit to find in him-
self, a symbol of protest against convention.
Some poets have found in him a symbol of
that desire for escape which is one of the
more marked mental traits of the modern
sedentary city-dweller.
AGsiak’s ballads differ from many of their
kind, in that they are written as near as
may be in the spirit of the men of that
time. They are all short, and that, it
seems, was the way of the buccaneers in most
things:—
Where the galleons flounder home
Lurching in the yeasty foam,
Captain Crossbones holds his court;
And his speech is very short:
Lad or lass who gives him play,
Goes a dreary, watery way;
If the thing he do ordain,
This fat hull shall split in twain;
If he do but fret or frown.
That tall ship shall topple down.
One of them had taken to the trade be-
cause of his hopeless love for a highborn
lady.
I saw her first in London Town,
A-riding in the street;
My heart went up and down, like dirt
From off her horse’s feet.
While another calls “a murrain on their
tinsel trash, their women and their wine.”
I would not give my sonsie soul
For riches of the sphere;
It is to save my coward soul
That I’m a buccaneer.
Visiak has just published a second booklet,
Flints and Flashes (E. Mathew's, Is.),
which keeps up to the level of the first,
and covers a greater variety of sub-
jects. He is finding material in current
affairs, but' has not yet discovered himself.
The two booklets are interesting for the
freshness of many of their little spurts of
song, and for their promise. Of the verses
reprinted here, “A Primitive Ilymn” and
“The Smoker of the Mist” are from Flints
and Flashes; the rest from Buccaneer Bal-
lads.
A DERELICT.
I wander in the city;
I wander in the slum;
Sometimes my meat’s tobacco,
And sometimes it is rum.
I borrow' front a comrade;
, I call on bygone friends:
My welcome is not kindly;
I take what fortune sends.
If phantoms rise to plague rue,
If wheels of mem’ry grind,
I kuow to cure the heartache,
I’ve physic for the mind.
I sometimes think at midnight:
When I, at last, am sped,
My ghost shall still go plodding
Through the cities of the; dead,
A PRIMITIVE HYMN TO THE SUN.
. C>» great and splendid shining light,
O, lantern of the earth:
things by thee are manifest,
Save Him that gave thee birth.
Are the bright stars thy little ones?
And is the moon thy queen?
And are they with thee in the deep
When she nor they are seen V
I know not what thou art, O sun :
I know not what am I:
I know not how I came, nor whence,
Nor whither go, nor why.
But this I know; that I must tread
The path that seems me right,
And climb the sky-way of my soul,
And sink into the night.
THE SMOKER OF THE MIST.
Under the moon,
The grey goblin
Smokes his white pipe,
Long and thin.
His gleaming eyes
Clint and roll—
Or is’t the sparks
From the pipe-bowl?
The bright stars blink. , »■
The moon grows dim
Over the goblin
Smoking grim.
He puffs the reek
In reel and rout,
Till the sun puts
His pipe out.
Romance and Reaiity
Holbrook Jackson is pushing to the front
in London as a literary go-between, one of
the necessary class who introduce readers
down below to the big writers higher up.
A book on Shaw, and an article on Maeter-
linck, are his best things to date. The lat-
ter is reprinted in Romance and Reality
(Sydney Book Club), together with intro-
ductions to H. G. Wells, Chesterton,
Blatchford and Will Rothenstein, artist.
These are part of the “reality” ; while “ro-
mance” comes into some pleasant essays on
the utility of idleness, the futility of grow-
ing up, the advantages of “going to No-
where,” on the joy of Make-believe, and the
curse of Deserts of Noise. The best of the
section is' a voyage “Southward Ho,” per
Herman Melville’s Typee , which -he bought
for 3d. at a bookstall. Here is the end of
the voyage
So I was there at last. I looked around
me at the forests which came down to the
beach, at the cocoa palms, at the little tent
like houses of bamboo- thatched with pal-
metto leaves ; and as I walked along to the
chief’s house I noted the color of the woods
They were not green like the woods of Eng-
land, but rainbow-lined: the very shadows
were painted like the wings of a butterfly.
All the trees seemed linked together with
garlands of flowers. Strange birds sang and
hopped and flutterect before me. Insects of
metallic lustre sported in the sun. The bam-
boos rattled on either hand, and the Mar-
quesas laughed and.shouted; some ran and
jumped, others gathered breadfruit and
cocoanuts; some spanked each other with
long palmetto leaves. I saw no signs of
work, nothing but idleness and play. ...
Another crowd ran to meet us; they scat-
tered flowers as they came, and ahead of
them sped the most beautiful damsel of them
all. Quickly they came on, and straight she
made for me. At first I felt nervous. Then, as
she drew nearer, I seemed to recognise her It
was Fayaway, the beautiful Fayaway of
Typee, Herman Melville’s lovely savage. She
approachedHaughing. panting, in a shower
of flowers, laid two soft hands in mine, held
up her red lips—and then, then, as they say,
I woke up.
If you don’t know Herman Melville you
ought to get Typee, Omoo and Moby Dick.
But it is best to have read them when you
were younger. When you have grown past
the age in which you want to be a bush-
ranger or a buccaneer, and you read Typee,
you want to go to the land “where it is
always afternoon,” and Fay a way is plenti-
ful. .. .According to the Missionary Society
reports the Islands are not what they used
to be in Melville’s time. Fayaway now
wears a hobble skirt!

A Pleasant Sunday Afternoon in Hell for
Is.! Ybu can get it by buying the new
edition of Letters from Hell (Macmillan),
translated from a German version of
the Danish original. An introduction
by the Rev. Geo. MacDonald is a
guarantee to • the righteous that
everything is conducted decently. It is
quite a homely place, this hell of the un-
known Danish author, with some exciting
scenes and a fair amount of dulness. It is
less solemn than Dante’s, less spicy than
Bernard Shaw’s, but somehow more con-
vincing than either, and its extent suggests
that Who’s IF/fo in Hell must bp a bulky
volume.
There are some good books in Macmillan’s
new Shilling Library (cloth, Is. 3d.). Ham-
er ton’s The Intellectual Life is a store of
literary anecdote, and may help you to suc-
cess in the same way as Smiles’s Self-Help,
by showing how other fellows have- achieved
it through following their own bent. South
Sea Bubbles, by the Earl and the Doctor, is
an entertaining book of travel amongst the
Pacific Islands. The Eazd is Pembroke, who
wrote an introduction for Louis Becke’s By
Reef and, Palm, and the Doctor is George
Kingsley, brother of the novelists—Charles
and Henry. A Poor Man’s House, by Ste-
phen Reynolds, gives a very intimate ac-
count of some fisherfolk on the south coast
of England. Reynolds lived amongst them,
and found them a jolly, sensible, likeable
people, strong in their simplicity and healthy
in their dirtiness. In selected chapters from
their daily life he enables the reader to see
them as lie saw them.
The Sad Story of the Hansom Cab
The new edition of The Mystery of a
Hansom Cab (Jarrold and Sons, Is. 3d.
cloth) bears on its title page the proud in-
scription—“sooth thousand.” It is long
ago, in the flight of books, since that
“shocker” first struck a public which is
always glad to be shocked, and the pub-
lishers believe that a new generation has
gr&wn up which knows not Fergus. There-
fore this new edition goes out, revised and
prefaced by a note in which Hume explains
how it came into being.
I was bent oh becoming a dramatist, but-
being quite unknown, I found it impossible
to induce the managers of Melbourne theatres
to accept, or even read, a play. At length
it occurred to me that I might further my
purpose by writing a novel. Up to that
time I. had only written one or two short
stories. ... I inquired of a leading Melbourne
bookseller what style of book he sold most
of. He replied that the detective stories of
Gaboriau had a large sale. As I had never
even heard of this author, I bought all his
works —-11 or thereabouts—and read them
carefully. The style of these stories at-
tracted me, and I determined to write a
book of the same class, containing a mystery,
a murder, and a description of low life in
Melbourne. This was the origin of the
“Cab.”
It looks easy, doesn’t it? But before rush-
ing off to do likewise, read the further re-
marks of Fergus Ilume :
. - Having completed the book, I tried to get
it published; but everyone to whom I offered
it refused even to look at the manuscript on
the ground that no colonial could write any-
thing- worth reading. ... I determined to pub-
lish it myself, and, accordingly, an edition of,
I think, some five thousand copies was
brought out at my own cost. The whole
edition went off in three weeks; a second also
sold rapidly. Later on, I parted with the
book to several speculators, who formed
themselves into “The Hansom Cab Pub-
lishing Go.” Taking the book to England,
they puolished it there with great success.
I may state, in conclusion, that I belong
to New Zealand, and not to Australia, that
I am a barrister, and not a retired police-
man, that I am yet two decades off 50 years
of age, that Fergus Hume is my real name,
anfi not a norn de plume, and that far
from making a fortune out of the book, all I
received for the English and American
rights previous to the issue of this revised
edition by my present publishers, was the
sum of £5O.
500,000 ! £so 'i ! Moral for authors —re-
serve royalties on everything you sell.
Nat Gould is still top-notcher amongst
the “sixpennieS,” with Charles Garvice a
close second. Gould has 60 novels to his
name, Garvice 53.

Australia: Its Land Conditions and Pros-
pects, the Report of the Scottish Agricul-
tural Commission of 1910-11 (Geo. Robert-
son and Co., Is.). They travelled 15,000
miles in Australia, and their impressions of
the country are mostly favorable. After a
rapid summary of their route, they tell the
intending emigrant what he should know
and what he may expect, and then give de-
tailed information about the various indus-
tries. Their criticism of the settler’s dwell-
ing, intended for the emigrant, deserves at-
tention out back: —
It may be a little hard to explain why
the settler has generally so unattractive a
home, comfortless within and bare without.
Possibly the Severity of his early struggles
has made him habitually heedless of such
things as beauty and comfort. , The conse-
quences are plain to see, for it is too often
the case that children reared in such homes
as these find life in the country dull and un-
desirable, and go off to the towns at ttie
first opportunity.. . .If he wants to keep his
children with him, and to have them eventu
ally settle near him, lie must provide fc
tlioiu a home that is attractive, he must no
work them like slaves, by making them mil
ten or a dozen cows every morning befor
going to school, nor grudge them their hour
of amusement when they come back.

days comes to be written, the heroic figur

The Round Table, a Quarterly Review of
the I olitics of the Empire, continues t<
sum up questions of Imperial interest with
attempted impartiality. An article in No
2, on “The Anglo-Japanese Alliance,” gives
what is substantially the Australian objec
tion to Oriental immigration :
It is not that the Oriental is inferior to
the Caucasian, but that he is different He
cannot be assimilated. He cannot be fitted
into our political, social or economic struc
ture. He is for ever a foreign element.
“The Problem of Imperial Defence” in No
3 stresses the difference between the policy
of Austialia and Lritaip on the Question ol
alien immigration, which has been stated
more forcibly by James Edmond in an
article in The National Review for July.
One article on the Australian Refer-
enda, written before the event, refers to
the Labor Conference’s treatment of W A
Holman as “in the spirit of the Scotch par-
son praying for Louis XIV.—‘O Lord, shake
him over the mouth of Hell, but don’t let
him drop.’ ”
The Australian representative of The
Round Table is M. L. MacCallum, of
Woollahra Point, Sydney. The Review is
useful for its views of politics in other
parts of the Empire, but the age is too
swift for a quarterly to have any influence.
The Table should revolve monthly.

'.Hue and I?lue, issued by the Marist Bro-
thers High School, Sydney, as a commem-
oration number, contains appreciations of
some eX-students —Roderic Quinn, E. J.
Brady, Frank Donohoe (who wrote The
Bulletins History of Botany Bay), and
others, with verses by Brady and Quinn, a
story by “Kodak,” and a swag of photo-
graphs and records of interest to scholars.
It is handsomely printed.
vol. 1 of The Australian Printer,
the official organ of the master printers of
the CommonweaUli, is issued by Hussey and
Dillingham,_ Ltd., of Adelaide. It is part of
the journal s policy’ “to secure further pro-
tection through Customs by obtaining in-
creased duties upon imported printed matter
and literature.” This number contains a re-
port and impressions of the first inter-State
conference of master printers, and other
matter of .interest to the craft. One con-
tributor makes Kipling say, “There are 960
ways of construing tribal laws, and every
individual one is right," which is not quite
fair to The Seven Seas.
A new edition of Winwood Reade’s Martyr-
dom yf Man has been issued, with an intro-
duction by F. Legge, a scientific writer of
some eminence. This introduction contains
information that, on account of the silence
of most books of reference regarding Reade
(who was a nephew of the great Charles), is
comparatively fresh. Rea.de was a most ex-
traordinary lad. He plunged into the heart
i i’ica, looking for fame, alone except for
the black carriers, and armed with nothing
but an old duck gun. He was irregular and
unreliable, and his expeditions hore no direct
scientific result, because he kept no proper
records. He wrote a few other books, but
nothing that approaches his Martyrdom of
man, for directness and literary style. In
1873 Reade was appointed correspondent for
Ihe 1 imes, during the Ashanti War. Two
years later lie died, at the age of 36, of tropi-
cal fevers and whisky. His best book was
turned down by the great critical papers of
the day. because it appeared to be blasphem-
ous, and so forth, but Legge points out that to-
day. orthodoxy has uttered more destructive
criticisms against the accepted principles of
religious dogma than were ever entertained
by’ our amateur explorer, who, politically’,
was Conservative.
This ,is the nineteenth edition, but the
book has only reached a sale.of 15,000 copies
altogether, and over 2000 of these have been
sold by one Melbourne bookseller. There is
in this country a great force of aspiring
intellect; it is liberal and open-minded, un-
biassed by tradition, it is hungry for infor-
mation; and in a rapid, epigrammatic work
like Winwood Reade’s it gets an introduction
to universal history, which is still of value.

A Clergyman’s Testimony to Clements Tonic .
REV. J. WILLIAMS.
A MINISTERING MEDICINE.
FOR ELEVEN YEARS PASTOR
of the Wooloongabba Congregational Church, Bris-
bane, and Principal of the Theological School
founded therewith, the Rev. John Williams, a strong
intellectual thinker, and a fine and forceful preacher,
well remembered in Brisbane for his splendid edu-
cational sermons and lectures, writes the following
letter to the merits of a great medicine which is
creating unquestionable cures of Nervous Breakdown,
Insomnia, Weakness, Brain-hag, and Stomach and
Liver Ailments. Business men and women in ill-
health should read this letter, especially if they wish
to regain health and strength, and enjoy life as only
healthy people can :
“Clements Tonic Cured Me.”
“CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“Prompted by a spirit of gratitude, I write to let you know that Clements
Tonic did for me what I have learnt it has done so effectively for others. I
suffered from nervous breakdown, consequent upon the strain of over-work,
and was for a time at quite a loss to find an effective recuperative. Happily
my choice fell on Clements Tonic, which restored me to my wonted self with
surprising speed and surety. When I have felt the same condition of nerves
arising, I have promptly checked it by a timely use of the remedy. Above
all, I find it induces a natural, refreshing sleep, wherein Nature has oppor-
tunity to work her cures in her own way; and what could be better said ofi~
a remedy than that ? I am, yours faithfully,
REV. d. WILLIAMS.”
Rvpfy wp.-t; letters in prnUc of the health-creating properties of this great medicine, Clpments Tonic,
are driven to the proprietors. They come from all States of the Commonwealth. Those persons who are
afflicted with impaired digestion, nervous breakdown, or debility, constipation, weakness, lassitude, low
spirits, hilionshess, sick headache, liver or kidney irregularity, should obtain Clements Tonic and health
at the same time. This letter proves this can be done. People who are ill, sickly, weak-nerved ; with
Strength, vigor, energy undermined, or who cannot get Btrong after long or sudden illnesses or attacks
of fever, etc., should read the tributes to this great medicine, and send for it without delay. Al ■
Chemists and Stores sell it everywhere in Australia, so that the sick person may obtain it.

Long, Heavy Hair?
Then treat your hair well. See
that it is properly fed. Growth
of every kind demands proper
food. Starved hair splits at the
ends, turns prematurely gray,
keeps short and dry. Then feed
your hair. Feed it with proper

it with Ayer’s Hair Vigor. Thus
help nature all you possibly can

TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless,

Ballad of Love Outworn.
The Gods of Eld were brave and gay
And strong and kind. Their dearest blisses
Were those we sinners love to-day,
The best of all—a strange thing, this is.
Their pure delights were spiced with kisses,
And kisses heightened their delight;
But down our paths the Serpent hisses . . .
The gods have passed into the night.
The goddesses were sweet, and they
’D have scorned our fashions’ artifices.
They were not so —how -shall we say?—
Upholstered as our modern misses.
Their lovers had no prejudices,
Nor feared grim prudes’ marauding spite.
Alas! we’re lost in dim abysses. . . .
The gods have passed into the night!
Their footprints fade. Where our feet stray,
A creeping vile paralysis is
Disarming joy. Prudence (that grey,
Sour jade) our every dream dismisses.
My heart is Joan’s, yours (maybe) Chrissie’s;
But, though their gentle eyes are bright,
Love limps and skulks and quite remiss is. . . .
The gods have passed into the night!
Ah, Youth ! the drear necropolis is
Our portion now. . . . (Are you dead? Quite?
Eros, who so equipped Ulysses?) . . .
The gods have passed into the night!
MAORILAND.
FRANK MORTON.
The Artist.
The year has turned the corner,
Cold June is with the dead,
And Spring, the singing artist,
Is mixing gold and red.
The red is meant for roses,
Rich roses, brave and bold;
The gold is for the wattle—
'Tis delicate, pale gold.
Great Sol, grown tired of exile,
Comes marching south again ;
’Tis he that stays the west-wind
That chills the hearts of men.
There shall be frond and feather,
Glad ways of greenery
When Spring unveils her painting
For all the world to sge.
Oh, red ’twill* be and golden,
That canvas of the South:
The gold shall be a girl’s hair,
The red shall be her mouth.

Homeward.
Sydney hath wreath of smiles,
Sydney hath store of spells,
But out across the miles
We hear the Melbourne bells —
We who have watched to probe
The hard heart, pity-free,
Beneath the hiding robe
Of sapphire-tinsell’d sea.
O painted city fair,
Though gay your harbor blaze,
There is no friendship there,
No love within your ways!
Though your sweet k’sses please
•Like some light woman’s spells,
We have no heart for these —-
We hear the Melbourne bells.
The car-wheels onward sing,
Blind-rushing through the night,
Each mile a charm to bring
The dream desired in sight,
To raise the goal we seek,
Across the mountains blue,
Where only winds are bleak,
Where only hearts are true.
Fade, fade beyond the spur
The siren-city’s eyne,
Drowning in drowsy blur
Of night and lantern-shine ;
Sleepless, through snow and showers
We stare the long night down,
Our eves across the hours,
On Melbourne, Melbourne-town.
MELBOURNE EXPRESS.
H. C. McKAY.
A Nocturne.
Comes merciful Night to the city,
Enshrouding its streets and its squares,
And bringing surcease in her pity
Of man’s multitudinous cares.
Hushed now is the turmoil of traffic,
Deserted the mart and the mill ;
For Silence, Night’s sister seraphic,
Has said to them—“ Peace! Be ye still!”
The portals of joys evanescent
The Thespian temples of bliss,
Alluringly glow, incandescent,
Or, radiant arc-litten, hisu
From Alcohol’s coarse tabernacles,
The revelry reaches his cell,
Where Murder sits brooding in shackles,
And adds a fresh pang to his hell.
Night covers awhile the uncleanness,
Conceals for a little the vile,
That man may humanity’s meanness
Remember no more for a while.
To lanes, to malodorous alleys,
Where little ones wail for their bread,
While drink-sodden motherhood dallies,
Comes night giving sleep in its stead.
His hour of triumphant achievement
To dreaming Ambition she lends,
And back to the arms of Bereavement
The dead for a little space sends.
The niggardly parks, where the clamor
Of children resounded before,
She wraps for young love in a glamor
As never saw ocean or shore.
Recurrently from the Creator,
Since dawning and darkness began,
Comes Night as a sweet mediator
’Twixt tyrannous Commerce and man.
“No further they toil, and no faster,
Abhorrent their sweat to My sight;
Give rest to thy slaves!” says man’s Master;
Trade bows to omnipotent Night.

These two new types possess,already the great superiority of the “Boomerang” Mouth Organ
tonality, but being tuned to the grand concert pitch, and provided with extra reeds, they at once
raise their bewitching harmony above the best reed-combination. The sweetness and body of re-
sonance emanating from the “BOOMERANG GRAND” can only be equalled by the tuneful combi-
nation of the Harp and Flute. Try one, and the “BOOMERANG GRAND” will become your
inseparable companion. Try the 6s. 6d. one for preference. - .

The Professional, 4s. ; the large “Boomerang,” 2s. 6d. ; the Miniature Professional, 2s; the Minia-

he first could become useful. (Applause.)— Wade, at the Farmers' Conference.

How to Address Letters.
Corespondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any
part of the contents of this number is hereby ex-
pressly reserved by the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where prac-
ticable, acknowledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the
form of Political. Social or other Articles, Verse,
Short Tales or Sketches (those dealing with Aus-
tralian subjects, and not exceeding two columns in
length, or. say, 3000 words, are specially accept-
able), Paragraphs. Letters or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will be regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable MS.
when, the address is specified and stamps are en-
closed. But no MS. will be returned, or preserved,
unless ,these conditions are observed. When MS. is
forwarded without stamps for return it will be un-
derstood that the copy is to be destroyed if not ac-
ceptable. Personal applications for return of MS.
cannot receive attention. The Bulletin desires,
further, those sending MS. to distinctly understand
that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.

“LOVE OF THRONE AND EMPIRE.”
“LdvE of Throne and Empire!” A common
phrase wherever a few “Liberals” are gath-
ered together; but what an amount of hum-
bug and snuffle and mendacity, unconscious
and otherwise, it comprehends! With the
broad principles that it is desirable (1)
that George Y r . shall remain on the throne,
and (2) that the British Empire shall re-
main intact, no sane Australian is going to
quarrel. George V. may not be a blazing
genius, but he is probably as good a man as
any conceivable aspirant for the position. And
as to Australia beginning the process of Em-
pire disruption, it is, and knows it. is, about
as fitted for anything of the sort as a week-
old child is to take part in a Marathon race.
The Australian democrat wishes the King
nothing worse than good luck and a record
reign; and if he suspected that the Common-
wealth was preparing to “train its guns on
the ships or the Motherland,” as Joseph
Cook stated the other day, he would be
both grieved and angry. But between that
point of view and the attitude adopted to-
wards Throne and Empire by the local “Im-
perialist,” there is a vast gulf full of nause-
ating cant and tragic ignorance.
* * * *
The genuine, high-geared, all-wool, 40-h.p.
tub-thumping Australian “loyalist” demands
immeasurably more of his neighbor than that
the latter shall accord the King of England
that measure of dispassionate approval —
tinctured by vague regrets that lie hasn’t
half as soft a job himself —which the normal
human being gives those who are making-
good in high places. He demands no less
than that we should love George V.! A few
weeks ago the cables were full of nonsense
about the “love” felt by a “grateful popu-
lace” for their King; he was said to be
"enthroned in his people's hearts,” and the
banal phrase was jumped at by our own
stump-orators of Empire and scattered broad-
cast. Now love, as Joseph Carruthers re-
marked dryly, in another connection, a day
or so back, is the rarest of passions. Few
manage to love their friends, much less their
enemies ; not all of us love our own blood-rela-
tions ; many fail, strive how they will, to love
their benefactors; unless the parsons lie, the
vast majority of us don’t even love God.
It is just possible that England’s present
King is so different from every other mon-
arch in history that he really is loved by all
who know him. But what earthly cause has
the man in the street to love this Sovereign
whom, for the most part, he has never even seen V
Frederick the Great, solely by his own
genius and energy, put Prussia in the fore-
front of the nations. He achieved the feat
without hampering his subjects with a farth-
ing of debt. Yet it would be wrong to say
that the 18th century Germans loved him.
Augustus made Rome the fairest city the
world had known. Under his rule its
theatres and arenas became marvels of beauty
and luxury; he gave the pleasure-loving
Latins all the things they best loved. How
many grieved when his body was carried to
its pyre along the Sacred Way? Trajan
within a few years doubled the area of the
Empire. Beside his military achievements
those of Kitchener and Roberts look like
child’s play. He made his country the dic-
tator of the known earth. And he was a
good citizen, as the article was understood in
his time. He died at the height of his fame
—and no one mourned. Was Louis Qua-
torze loved, outside his Court, at any period
of his splendid reign; or the First Gentle-
man of Europe, on whom his contemporaries
spilled so much adulation; or Charles 1.,
who was so charming and good ; or Charles
11., who was so charming and bad? Ed-
ward VII. has been dead barely a year. He
was an ideal Constitutional Sovereign, and,
by all accounts, the possessor of the kindest
and most winning of personalities. His
name was constantly on the lips of the folks
who are now forever maundering about their
love for his son. Yet, when a movement was
started in Sydney the other day to perpet-
uate his memory by a monument, it became
apparent that he was forgotten by those who
had claimed to adore him most. An “anony-
mous loyalist” weighed in with £lOOO (and
if his name isn’t disclosed when the next
list of “honors” is being compiled, this paper
will be astonished) ; a number of big public
companies formally donated sums which
meant no more, as indications of affection,
than their land and income tax payments.
But the half-crowns and shillings of the pop-
ulace have been as tardy as the guineas of
Bruce Smith, Thomas Henley, Brother
Snowball, and the rest of the “loyalists”
who got so much political and social capital
out of the dead King in his lifetime. It is
always thus, and always will be. When The
Bulletin is shown a monarch who is greater
than Napoleon 1., more picturesque than
Caesar, handsomer than the youthful Had-
rian, more moral than Charles I. of Eng-
land—in short, when it discovers a Sovereign
who is a God on earth —it may begin to re-
gard the “loyalists’ ” protestations of adora-
tion as genuine. Meanwhile it takes the
view that all such protestations are, in the
nature of things, either hypocritical or
hysterical.
No less bogus is the same people’s al-
leged “love” of Empire. The electors, here
and in the United Kingdom, only became
what we may call Empire-conscious about
a decade ago. Chamberlain won the
“Khaki election” on the Empire cry. He
tried it again in his preferential-trade cam-
paign. but it failed, largely because, by 1905,
the British constituencies had learned the
inner meaning of corybantic Imperialism,
and were sick of being exploited for the
benefit of Empire-builders like the Beits,
Joels and Babnatos. “Empire” has been
used in recent years to rush on a gullible pub-
lic so many rank financial and political swin-
dles that it stinks in the nostrils of many
respectable Britishers.' The Australian
Conservative (now, as always, years behind
the point of view of his epoch) has not
yet grasped the truth that the old cliches on
this subject—the Kii’LiNG.-isms and “Pink
’Un” heroics which did such invaluable Tory
service in the past—are dead and discred-
ited. The views that Prime Minister
Fisher was said to have disclosed in Lon-
don last month, evoked a yell of fury from
this section. Yet, shorn of their somewhat
painful crudity, they represent the identical
sentiments that British statesmen and
thinkers of all parties have been expressing
for several years. They are the view® of
Balfour, the closest reasoner of the Tory
party; and here is what Lord Haldane,
perhaps the most cultivated and philosophic
of the Radicals, had to say on the subject a
few days ago : —-
Few persons supposed that the United States would
have remained under an English centralised Govern-
ment, even though George 111. had not been foolish.
A similar difficulty might arise ih Canada, Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, or South Africa. If Canada de-
veloped a population of 80,000,000, could she remain
under any sort of written or rigid systemt
About the same time, William McMillan
was informing a Sydney audience, with all
the vehemence of the immemorial linen-
draper pushing a “spiff” line in undercloth-
ing, that “it was unthinkable that the
British Empire should not remain as at
present constituted for all time!" Which
was about as rational and credible as if
McMillan had told his hearers that he
was immortal.
* * * #
It is desirable, in the name of truth, sin-
cerity. honesty, horse-sense and a dozen
other kindred virtues, that this sort of thing
should be jumped on. The plain truth is,
the British “Empire is neither lovable nor
imperishable. As to the latter quality, the,
recently uttered words of A. J. Balfour
state the case as most intelligent persons
view it:—
I do not quarrel with those—l do not accuse them
either of want of perception, imagination, or pat-
riotism—who say that the British Empire, as we
know it, is but a transitory arrangement . . . that
the time must come when these great and growing
communities will feel that all that could be gained
from the Empire as it used to be understood has
been gained, and that, in all kindness of heart, and
with every sympathy, each member of the Empire
had better go its own way like adult members of a
human family.
The Roman Empire which Cassar won, and
Augustus ruled; the Babylonian and
Assyrian, the Macedonian, and the Medo-
Persian Empires have all passed away;
Charlemagne’s Empire is extinct; the Holy
Roman Empire has been dead for a cen-
tury; and at the appointed time the Jap
and German and (wordy haberdashers not-
withstanding) the British Empire must fol-
low in their wake. As to the British Em-
pire’s lovableness, one is constrained to
inquire what qualities it possesses which
make an Australian claim to love it who
would cheerfully own to hating (say) Vic-
toria. We do not love niggers, and there
are, roughly, five times as many niggers in
the British Empire as there are white men.
The Wowser does not love infidels, and most
of the Empire is pagan, and regards the
Caucasian section as unclean dogs. None of us
love deserts, or undrained swamps, or im-
penetrable forests, and most of the Empire’s
scenery is of that description. Nor do we love
disease and poverty and dirt, and 80 per cent,
of the Empire is chronically afflicted by
these horrors. The stock puerilities about
love of Throne and Empire have been em-
ployed, for political purposes, for so long
now that plain persons, who lack the gift
of self-analysis, have come to take them
for granted. They look on the citizen who
frankly admits that he has no real love for
a strange king who lives 12,000 miles away,
and who has never benefited him (the citi-
zen) personally, in much the same light as
the pietists of the Middle Ages regarded him
who questioned the “Divine Right,” or
denied the usefulness of “touching for evil.”
And they attempt to class the patriot who
puts a White Australia before a Black-and-
tan Empire as something between a traitor
and an imbecile. Genuine loyalists will dis-
courage this sort of idiocy with all their
might. It has done more, of late years,
to bring ridicule on Royalty, Empire and all
the appurtenances thereof, than anything
else.
CONCERNING SURGICAL OPERATIONS.
The modern surgeon is a person worthy of
large honor. Almost every phase of our
civilisation is open to some question, but all
men admit that those who cobble and repair
the human form divine are able to do things.
The achievements of the lancet are such as
to take men’s breath away in good metaphor,
as well as in mere fact. Only yesterday an
American woman had a new nose made by
the grafting on of a portion of a rib ; and,
the day before, Germany recorded an in-
stance in which important improvements had
been made to a man’s heart. Skin-grafting,
the removal and replacing of brains, the
transplanting of teeth, and any number of
intricate dealings with the internal mechan-
ism of humanity have become mere common-
places of the advancing trade. Some scien-
tific craftsman has recently threatened us
with a proposal to discard unhealthy organs
from men, and replace them wiui the healthy
corresponding parts taken from living brutes ;
and the most astounding results have been
achieved in the way of removing all sorts of
tumors, cysts, and unhealthy growths which
have fixed themselves on the living tissues
of an otherwise respectable body. With
nerves of steel and infinite skill, the surgeon
gets to work with his razor-keen tools. Li£e
and death wrestle together in the touch of
his firm fingers. One trembling of the hand,
one careless glance or wandering thought,
and the prize goes to Death. But the sur-
geon has learned not to falter, and more and
more the ministry of the lancet works to the
triumph of life. Fling him the laurel crown
of the age! Warrior, statesman, inventor,
singer—all must take one step down. The
surgeon at his best stands out as the man
who, above all others, is doing things—the
king of the moving time.
* * * *
With the advance of surgery many dis-
eases have come into great prominence. It
is open to question, however, whether any
of them have really become more deadly or
of more frequent occurrence, except perhaps
that horrible and defiant product of civilisa-
tion itself, the malignant cancer, which still
holds the race of men in cruel derision. A
correct diagnosis of disease explains the
seeming multiplication of evils which were
unknown in the days of our fathers, or sel-
dom mentioned in their hearing. For in-
stance, that popular trouble which traded
under the patronage of royalty itself, and so
carried with it a social glamor which to
some people made the pain quite endur-
able, was variously ascribed in days gone by
to witchcraft, the direct interference of the
Devil, or violent inflammation of the parts
that deal, with the secondary results of din-
ner. Now we know that it is merely the
anger of a small and idle organ called the
vermiform appendix, consequent upon the in-
vasion of its empty uselessness by an orange
pip or a fragment, of crockery. And, since
science knows what it is. aopend'cit's !s now
comparatively easy to deal with. The cap-
able surgeon makes an incision, and at one
stroke removes the seat of the pain, together
with its cause. A few stitches, a dab or
two of healing paint, a little careful nursing,
and the patient is himself again, minus the
little death-trap which reposes, orange-pip
and all, in a bottle of spirits. The matter
of cancer is, unhappily, very different; here
even the best manipulators of the well-inten-
tioned knife are baffled. It has of late been
proclaimed to be a disease of strong life. The
cell tissue of the body, reproducing itself too
rapidly, becomes malignant through its own
over-abundant vitality. Yet even here, al-
though complete cure is rare, the skill of the
surgeon can bring some relief from a torture
that, in sheer devilishness, is several laps
ahead of all old conceptions of Tartarus and
Tophet.
* * * #
The great principle behind all surgery was
one well known to horticulturists in the days
when Vikgie divided his time between work-
ing his selection, as a small Italian cocky, and
singing in rolling hexameters the glories of
Imperial Rome. To keep a fruit tree in pro-
per condition, he knew that the pruning-
knife must be freely used. The principle
has been extended to every branch of busi-
ness and every variety of trade. The moment
a limb or artery shows symptoms of being
diseased or useless, the management of the
concern suggests a surgical operation, and
the useless or injurious growth is cut away.
Death may, and sometimes does, follow the
operation; but without the amputation death
is certain in any case, and ordinary horse-
sense prompts the use of the knife. Unfor-
tunately, there is one sphere into which
horse-sense rarely enters. In the realm of
politics there is continual growth and accu-
mulation, and the very last thing to be
tnought ot is a judicious application of the
pamtul but health-giving lancet. All sorts
ot old warts, corns, bunions and tumors —not
to speak of cancer, appendicitis and ophthal-
mia—have been allowed to remain from
year to year, and there is a constant ten-
dency on the part of Parliamentary institu-
tions to run to abnormal growth rather than
to develop along the lines of rugged health
and sound physique. The skill of the sur-
geon is everywhere badly needed, but hither-
mi ie P u bli c has been little alive to the fact.
m! 1 ere , 1S a concrete example under our nose,
lhe birth of the Commonwealth was hailed
with delight by the people of a continent. It
was regarded as a healthy babe, with one
head and a number of stout limbs; but it
has turned out to be a strange monstrosity
with six unnecessary heads and enough re-
dundant feet to furnish a spring poet with
material for an outburst on centipedes. The
proposal for a slight operation which, while
leaving the anatomy of the strange creature
intact, would have somewhat increased the
power of the main pair of hands,' was em-
phatically turned down by the recent Refer-
enda ; and so, for the present, nothing can be
done except to record the wild absurdity or
the fact, and wait for a lucid interval in the
of the national insanity.
But the growth of strange and monstrous
forms is a feature not only of the body
politic, but of the political factions which
wrestle for the control of that body. The
most, strenuous and earnest thing in the way
of a political organisation which has yet
come to the fore is the Australian Labor
party. Little more than a year ago that
party swept from its path the wrecks of the
Fusion failure, and assumed command in the
Federal sphere. A smaller victory followed
in the State of N. S. Wales; but no sooner
had some of the State Ministers risen to the
dignity of office than they contrived by well-
directed speech or ill-conditioned silence to
raise obstacles in the path of Federal Labor,
and insure the success of its opponents in
matters of grave national concern. At once
the question naturally arose as to what kind
of malignant growth had fastened itself upon
the healthy life of the party; and then arose
also the question of a surgical operation.
The preliminaries having now been com-
pleted, a full diagnosis of the case is to be
made, and it is possible that at least the
knife will be unflinchingly used in an at-
tempt to save the life and integrity of Labor
in N. S. Wales. That a slight fever may fol-
low the operation is highly probable,' and
that death itself may ensue is even remotely
possible; but there is something in the tem-
per of a party that will have health and
clarity of purpose at all hazards, which fills
us with a big hope of its ultimate recovery
and restoration to the full vigor that it can
never enjoy while it harbors the malignant
growth.
* * * *
People who describe the coming confer-
ence of the Political Labor Leagues as a
“heresy hunt” are missing the true purport
of the thing as completely as those who
mistake Protective duties for a new r means of
exploiting the earnings of the people. There
should be no confusion here. The best and
truest section of the Labor party menus to
have, a clean record and a straight policy, or
nothing. Better, they say, a dozen honest
and unshrinking big Australians to carry
the Labor banner than four dozen nonde-
scripts who can only be distinguished from
Tories by their peculiar and soul-stirring
balcony yell. What the conference will be
called to decide is not so much whether cer-
tain men have acted against the spirit of
resolutions carried at previous meetings of
the body, as whether there shall be a pro-
nouncement made once and for all that
Labor stands for Australia, and that any
man. who is determined to run the interests
of his parish drain and provincial cabbage-
garden against those of a continent must be
regarded as a traitor to the cause. Persons
who pretend to think, that they are serving
N. S. Wales by doing injury to the Common-
wealth must appear to answer for their sins
before the delegates of the whole State, and
the. future of the movement turns upon the
decision which may be given. A surgical
operation, by. which all that is false to the
larger aspirations of Australian Labor might
be forever cut off from its organisation,
would naturally be a matter of life and death
to the party; but without such operation
the body is already moribund, and its coffin
may be ordered any time. Of course, the
delegates may elect to play with the matter,
or even endorse the injurious folly of certain
little men of crooked vision; but, in that
case, there will be an urgent call for the for-
mation in the State of a new party whose
first, chief and final aim shall be Australia.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Ballad of Bill’s Breeches.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Once on a time, a party by the name of Mr.
Bull
Discovered that with many schemes his
hands were pretty full.
His cares of family were great. Four fine
young sons he’d got;
They were, indeed, of goodly breed, a strong
and hefty lot.
But Mr. Bull’s domestic cares (as shortly
will be seen)
Were not with them, but with his wife,
whose name was Jingophine.
A foolish fad this lady had that all the boys
were ninnies;
And, though they grew,
As children do.
She dressed them all in pinnies.
Now, while her boys were young, Josh*
Bull engaged in business strife—
Took little heed of their affairs, and left
them to his wife ;
And Jingophine, who loved her lord, im*
pressed them, noon and night.
With tales of his magnificence, his wisdom,
wealth and might.
But when they talked of growing up, and
“helping pa” some day,
She shook her finger at them in her stern,
maternal way.
“Your pa’s a great, big man,” she Said. “You
never, never, never
Can hope to be
As big as he, —^
Or half so wise and clever.


Bidding Up for Votes.
The Weary-Watt Government is reaching
out for the country vote with both hands and
a hook. Its latest announcement is that it
proposes to practically abolish the better-
ment tax or “loading” imposed in connection
with new railway lines. The demand that
the Government should offer this bribe was
made by two or three country members, who
are either Fat themselves, or represent Fat,
and it is of course enthusiastically backed up
by the Argus. The main argument used
is" the fatuous one that the railways are now
paying handsomely, and the “loading” is,
theretore. not needed. Nothing is said about
the bad seasons that are to come —bad sea-
sons in which the railways will not only
have less work to do. but will also be asked
to do a good deal of it for nothing. Still,
the “loading” system really not related to
the seasons at all. It is simply a matter of
equity—a payment for services rendered.
In the bad old days, when the State made a
railway, the landowners whose property was
enhanced in value by its presence actually
fined the Government for building it by
charging exorbitant prices for the land re-
quired. Of later years the Victorian Gov-
ernment, grown a little wiser, called on t
landowners to form a Trust and provide the
place to put the railway; and it has also
“loaded” the neighboring land. -that 1S to
say, it has asked for some of the added value
which the railway has created. There 1S » ot
course, no doubt about that added value.
Thus, a railway is now being built across the
Western plains, from Gheringhap (Geelong)
to Maroona (Ararat), through lnverleigh,
Cressey, Lismore, Derrinallum and Lake
Bolac ; and what its construction means to
the squatter is evidenced by the fact that
when Tommy Bent, five years ago, had a
look at this country with a railway vaguely
in view, one landlord offered to pay the cost
of making the line through his run about lo
miles —if the Government would go on with
the work. This meant a payment of about
£26,000; yet it was estimated at the time
that the squatter would still be about
£24,000 in pocket. And not only is the
“loading” system fair, but its application in
Victoria is scientific. The railway cannot
pass close by every man’s door, or through
every squatter’s run. Therefore, its benefits
are unequal. The fortunate landowner close
to the line sees his land increased in value
by, sav, £2 an acre; his more distant neigh-
bors, 6n the other hand, reap an unearned
increment of from 30s. down to Is. per acre.
The “loading” system, in the hands of a local
Trust which knows its business, can arrange
the rates to a nicety, and thus justice is
done. The abolition of this excellent system
means neither more nor less than the robbery
of the people who are not directly benefited
by railway construction ; and if they don’t kick
hard they will deserve just about all they
get in the way of spoliation.
Is It Worth It?
The rightful Governor of N. S. Wales —the
costly import who, when his salary and his
rent-free residences and his free railway
passes and so on are taken into considera-
tion, costs the State every penny of £lO,OOO
per annum—has been in England for
some months. During that period the Cor-
onation ceremonies have occurred here; and
a political crisis which was unique, inas-
much as it called for all that a State Gov-
ernor might possess of legal and Constitu-
tional knowledge, horse sense and courage.
The Coronation celebrations passed off with-
out the snapping of so much as one link in
the golden chain of Ilempire, and the crisis
in the Assembly was dealt with in a way
that no one cavilled at in the end. These
situations, which are typical of the situa-
tions' that are supposed to call for handling
by an absurdly expensive imported official,
were met, with apparent ease, by Lord
Chelmsford’s substitute, Chief Justice
Cullen. This serves to emphasise the cant
and fraudulency that surround the case for
the further importation of State Governors.
They are paid more lavishly than the most
valuable of the State’s public servants; yet
when they take a holiday, hardly anyone
outside an infinitesimally small set notices
the difference, and, where the difference is
noticed, the general comment is that,better
work was done by the cheap substitute than
could possibly have been expected of the ex-
pensive original. One province the imported
Governor is able, on the present terms, to
fill to the exclusion of all possible home-
born rivals, and one only—that'fif entertain-
ment-provider on a big scale to a small class.
Titled Britons do not exile themselves to
Australia as a matter of altruism. They
have a definite object—a star,, a step in the
peerage, or what not —in view every time;
and to attain it they cheerfully spend their
big salaries on the dinners, teas, etc., that
are expected of them. The wild absurdity
of the business lies not only in the fact that
the section of the community which achieves
these free meals is precisely that section
which needs them least, but in the further
circumstance that the provisions are paid
for, in reality, by the general population,
consisting chiefly of humble folks who have
no money to spare for such purposes. The
grotesque position, therefore, is that the
State at large is heavily subsidising a total
stranger, in order that he may supply food
and drink to such citizens of Sydney as have
more than enough to pay for their own sus-
tenance. If the imported Governor per-
formed any single function that a local man
was not in every way competent to do, the
above allegation would not carry weight.
But he doesn’t, and he never has. There
are innumerable directions in which such sub-
sidy money as a debt-loaded State has to
spend might be more profitably expended
than in feeding the already fat; and at the
general elections, which appear imminent in
at least three States, citizens might do worse
than mention the point to vote-chasers, with
a view to extracting the necessary pledges.
_
The C.S.R. Co.’s “Honorable Understanding.”
The attention of Attorney-General Hughes
and every other patriotic person in the Com-
monwealth is invited to a signed statement
made in the Age, of August 4, by William
Peacock, director of the Australasian Jam
Co., Ltd. Peacock was endeavoring to
throw some light on the question of the
dearness of jam, notwithstanding the
cheapness of fruit, and the main
points in his statement remain so far uncon-
tradicted. These are that the “Colonial
Sugar Refining Co. claims as a sine qua non,
before doing business on other than pro-
hibitive terms, that manufacturers (of jam,
etc.) shall purchase from it, or other Aus-
tralian producers, all the sugar they need.”
This means that “the C. S. R. Co., and it
only, is to have the right to supply sugars
refined from foreign raw sugars, there being
no other, sugar refiners in Australia.” And
this is why :
For these foreign sugars they demand 30s. per
ton more than the price at which manufacturers can
import the foreign sugar themselves. If we do not
submit _ to this overcharge, the co. will only supply
Australian-grown sugar for the manufacture of
Australian-consumed jam at a charge (even for a
parcel of 4000 tons) of 10s. per ton more than it
will supply a non-obstreperous manufacturer, even
though he uses only 100 tons. In plain fact, we
were this year met by a demand that we should
'draw our supplies of foreign-grown sugar (which
alone secures the full drawback) from the co. (at
an overcharge of 30s. per ton), otherwise they
Would mulct us in £2OOO when we went to them
for the 4000 tons of Australian sugar we required.
That makes the position fairly plain. t To
carry on an export trade, in competition
with the foreigner, the Australian manufac-
turers ask for the cheapest sugar they can
get, which admittedly is foreign sugar.
This sugar pays £6 duty on landing, but on
export in jam the £(i is refunded. These
jam-manufacturers of course also supply the
Australian market, and for that market they
must have Australian sugar, and to get that
sugar they must go to the C.S.R. Thus the
jam-manufacturers are wholly in the hands
of the C.S.R. And knowing that, according to
the Uncontradicted statement of Mr. Peacock,
the cormorant co. says: “You shall pay either
80s. more than fair market rate for foreign
sugar, or 10s. more than the fair market
price for foreign sugar—whichever you
please.” If this country is to make decent
industrial progress—if manufacturers and
artisans are to have a reasonable chance of
success —this highway robbery must be put
down. And if the Australian Parliament
hasn’t the power to put it down, further
steps should be taken to get that power.
The home jam consumption is practically
supplied, exporting is unprofitable under the
conditions, and the manufacture of Austra-
lian canned fruit is not a tenth of what it
should be, because it is already unprofitable.
Yet the area under fruit cultivation is in-
creasing rapidly. Unless this cold-blooded
and outrageous hold-up is stopped, those
producers who are now planting acres of
fruit trees will find, when they gather their
first crops five or seven years hence, that the
trees are only good for firewood, and are not
much good even for Pmt.
Pity tne Poor Lunatic!
It is only the other day, in a historical man-
ner of speaking, that the zany or lunatic was
regarded as one possessed of devils. The
remedy that the State, on the advice of the
faculty, applied to his trouble was close
confinement, varied by assault and battery.
Poor old George 111., of England, was fre-
quently decorated with black eyes and
similar contusions, in the closing stages
of his malady, the same being supplied
by his attendants, under the delusion
that such decorations had a curative
effect. Australia has advanced surpris-
ingly little, as regards a proper appre-
ciation of the community’s duties towards its
mentally unbalanced members, since those
dark days of not so long ago. Consider what
happens to-day to a! person who suddenly
goes daft, or arouses a suspicion that he is
daft, at (say) Dottyville, which is half a
dozen miles from Jugtown, where the gaol
is. A posse of police arrives, grabs the
afflicted one, and lodges him in one of the
cells of the Jugtown gaol, till such time as
the Government medical officer and another
medico can come together and certify him in
sane. That done, he is haled before the local
Police Magistrate, or a J.P. or two. His
mania may be the sort that leaves him as
sensitive as any man to the horror of shame-
ful surroundings. Yet he has to herd with
felons while he is awaiting the magistrate’s
order committing him to an asylum, and
wheD he leaves for that asylum he does it
under police escort, and in company with
(and frequently handcuffed to) convicted
criminals. This is all most monstrously
wrong. The police should have no more to
do with the handling of mentally-diseased
folks than they have with the handling of
diphtheria or plague patients. The lunatic,
or suspected lunatic, should not be rushed
into a prison for his condition to be
diagnosed there. A special room ought to
be provided at the local hospital, where such
cases could be dealt with. He should not
be forced to appear in a public court. As a
matter of fact, an insane person’s appear-
ance in one of these places is a piece of
gratuitous cruelty in every case, as is evi-
denced by the fact that, where the patient is
violent, the P.M. dispenses with his presence
in court. Above all, the up-country sufferer
who is being taken by rail for lodgment in a
hospital should not be called on to do the
journey with persons, whose destination is
possibly a gaol. It may be objected that
ambulances and staffs of attendants qualified
to escort the mental ruin from the site of
his breakdown to the front door of the
asylum will have to be provided by the dif-
ferent hospitals if the existing system is
done away with; and those things mean
extra expense. But a civilised State has a
right to. damn the expense when it is a ques-
tion of wiping an archaic barbarism off its
slate.

Military Spirit—Bottled and in Bulk.
Melbourne’s Scottish Regiment, founded
by the late Malcolm • McEacharn, is not
going to surrender its foreign clannishness
without a struggle. A deputation consist-
ing of “representatives of the various Scot-
tish societies, Scotsmen, and those of Scot-
tish descent” is to wait oh the Minister of
Defence, and dispute the policy of forming
an All-Australian army for All-Australian
defence. The chairman of the Scotchmen's
indignation meeting said that the proposal
to do away with the Scottish Regiment was
in direct opposition to the advice of Lord
Kitchener, who favored the maintenance of
regiments which inculcated “pride of race”
and esprit de corps. If Kitchener talked
of non-Australian incentives to esprit de
corps in the Australian forces (which prob-
ably he didn’t), he was ignoring the fact
that racial rivalry is not a little bit essen-
tial to regimental pride. In the German
Army Black Brunswickers preserve a
friendly rivalry with Yellow Ditto; one
Hungarian regiment likes to flourish its
banner against another, and so with various
brigades labelled Brittany, Poland, or what
not. In little England the-Tommies cherish
petty county distinctions; and even mere
numeral distinctions —44th foot or 66th
foot —supply all the esprit de corps neces-
sary to harmless swagger. When a red-
faced colonel roars, “Boys of the 39th!” he
speaks as a schoolmaster urging Ins forces
to compare favorably with the pupils of a
college in the next suburb. What more in-
spiration to friendly competition among
regiments does the Commonwealth want than
its own geographical divisions, and its
widely-separated towns and districts? Isn’t
there enough rivalry between the cricket
teams? Or the footballers? The notion of
this country breeding its martial valor under
the influence of Melbourne Scottish, Sydney
Irish. Brisbane Welsh, Coolgardie Cockneys
and S’Australian Germans is in violent an-
tipathy to Australian nationalism. Let
the various combinations of khaki have as
much esprit as football teams; but let all
their rivalry have a common Australian
color and a true Australian feeling. We
want no racial sectarianism in our honest
pa.gan religion of Mars.
Victoria’s Minister of Agriculture Gra-
ham, who suffers from good intentions and
a lack of capacity to carry them out, is
much exercised over a new “industry.’'
Oversea shipping companies refuse to con-
cern themselves with the export of fruit, un-
less they are guaranteed a certain minimum
space per vessel, and also get due notice of
the amount of room required; and as no
individual, or even small association of
orchardists, can give this guarantee, the job
is done by two city firms, who retail the
space to individual shippers, charging the
latter about twice as much as they them-
selves pay; and when they can’t farm out
ail the space, the speculators ship on their
own account whatever fruit they can get.
hold of. Graham, recognising that the
small shipper was paying through the nose,
begged Tudor, of the Customs, to do sotae-
thing ; and Tudor decided that there wasn’t
anything he could do. There certainly is
the Australian Industries Preservation Act,
which says : —-
Any person who monopolises or attempts to mono-
polise or combines or conspires ... to monopolise
any nart of the trade or commerce with other coun-
tries or among the States ... is guilty of an offence.
Penalty £5OO.
But it is very doubtful whether that could
be made to apply to a case of this kind.
And, anyhow, if the two private speculators
in space are knocked out, somebody will
have to organise this shipping business;
and the proper agent for the job is
Graham’s own Department of Agriculture,
which should secure the space and parcel it
out among growers. In fact, there is no
sound reason why the State shouldn’t con-
stitute itself the sole export agent if it
found it couldn’t get the requisite consign-
ments any other way.
The cab horse and his driver are in a bad
way. The relentless spirit of change lias
been treading him down with heavier boots
than a spirit ought to wear, and he natur-
ally feels that a horrible injustice is being
perpetrated, and that it is up to a Labor
Government to do something about it. In
Sydney he even goes the length of saying■
that tne Wade Administration treated him
more kindly than the party now in power,
and threatens to withdraw Ins allegiance, and
become a “Liberal” or a Tory. The horse
cabby has no doubt had a hard time. He
has been moved on from choice stands, owing
to the increase of traffic, only to see the
hated taxi take up the position he has been
forced to vacate. He has petitioned, pro-
tested, threatened the members of the Min-
istry that he would bring the missus and
kids down to argue the matter on the official
doormat if something was not speedily done ;
and still he is no better off, and the horseless
horror runs away with most of his bread
and all his butter. Some time ago one
Minister advised him to learn to drive a
taxi; but the suggestion was received with
such indignation as an archer might have,
shown if asked to put away his long-bow and
learn to shoot with the strange and evil-
smelling explosive thing which replaced it.
Still, a lot of worse advice might have been
given; for the ancient horse-cab must go
the way of Freetrade, and battle-axes, and
witchcraft, and drains in the public streets,
and the slave trade, and a whole lot of other
hoary institutions that combined to make
what are known as the good old times. In
spite of the sympathy of the Trades Hall,
and the State Government, and certain sec-
tions of the tender-hearted public, it would
be as easy to bring back Julius Cacsar or
Louis XIV. to sway the destinies of modern
Europe as to try to secure a permanent place
for the horse-caLby and his dear, old, grand-
father’s van.

From a Victorian railway employee:—
It was announced recently that Vic. railway men
were getting an aggregate rise of £116,000 a year.
A day or two later 1 got this:—
“Sir, —I am instructed by the owner to inform
you that from Monday next the rent of house occu-
pied by you will be raised one. shilling per week.
Yours, , agent for owner.”
Last pay-day I received my portion of the
£115,000 —Is. 6d. per week! Now I am dreading
every knock at the front door, lest it be the agent
after the other 6d. Of course, the landlords’ de-
mands for bigger rents have helped to increase the
price of commodities far beyond the 6d. But the
tradesmen haven’t done their brigandage in so bare-
faced a manner, which is probably why it doesn’t
hurt so much. Isn’t it about time the Labor party
got to holts with the brigands? The State supplies
the country cocky with railways, “because railways
are indispensable to him in carrying on his cockying
job. But railways are no more indispensable than
homes are to the equally desirable person who slaves
in a factory or drives the railway engines; and the
private landlord knows how to be just as extortion-
ate as any private railway shark, so the public needs
as much protection from one as from the other.
Rent is a devil that worries two-thirds of the
workers ; and the Labor party that can convince the
people that it is going to give this devil a hot time
will just fly in.
“Lex” on the impressiveness of uniform: —
Melbourne has been sizzling over what is known
as “the Brunswick case.” It appears that a youth,
named Robinson, was walking inoffensively home
on a recent night, when a man ranged along-
side, and entered into conversation. Robinson,
having no wish for the stranger’s acquaintance,
walked silently on. The other dogged him. Robin-
son began to run. Bullets started whistling about
his head. The stranger was taking pot-shots at him.
About here the narrative becomes mixed. The
stranger was one of Melbourne’s tragically-futile
’tecs ; and naturally, since Robinson was a respect-
able lad, he (the ’tec) had diagnosed him as a male-
factor. The police officer, while not denying his own
gun-practice, claimed that Robinson also shot at
him; but the latter produced eight reputable wit-
nesses to throw doubt on that story. Nevertheless,
at the police enquiry, the constable was “exonerated
of all blame,” and Robinson was told figuratively
to run away and play. The Victorian Government is
now taking a hand with a view to elucidating the
mystery. The outstanding feature of the affair is the
evidence it affords of the way these policemen trust
one another. The John Dunn’s seemingly incurable
tendency to take the word of his fellow-DuNN for
Gospel is one of the menaces of our modern civili-
sation. Experience proves that the policeman is
neither more moral nor more truthful than the
civilian, and he is very often less intelligent. Yet,
in the places where justice is administered, his word
carries more weight than that of many honest men
who do not happen to wear uniform. Judges, magis-
trates, J’s.P., are all more or less under the spell.
In London, such distinguished citizens as Professor
Ray-Lanrf,ster, Sir George Alexander, and W. E,
Gladstone bumped against the Law in the execu-
tion of its duty, and all Went down. And similar
cases might be" cited here. The people who have
been writing agitatedly to the Melbourne papers
are not moved half so much, nrobablv, by sympathy
for Robinson as they are by the reflection, conscious
or otherwise, that their turn may come next. As
things stand, an unscrupulous policeman or detective
has it in his power to make things particularly hot
for one who has aroused his ire. To be merely
charged with drunkenness or obscene language, not
The boys grew into gawky lads; but their

Insisted they were only babes, despite the
howl of Bill.
This William was a sturdy youth, big-
boned, and long o’ limb;
Indeed, his ma was much concerned about
the growth of him.
3ut. like the rest, she had him dressed in
pinafore and bib,
Though at such clothes Bill cocked his nose,
and seemed inclined to jib.
In shrewish tones she scolded him: “You
bad, ungrateful Willie !
Put on your frill.”
“But,” answered Bill,
"It makes a bloke look silly !”
Now, .Tingophine, like other dames of fussy,
frilly kind,
Delighted to have round her folk of weak
and narrow mind.
Pet parsons were her weakness, also aider-
men and those
Who held the very strictest views, and wore
the nicest clothes.
They cheesed her when she praised her lord,
and listened, with a frown,
To tales of Bill ; and all agreed he’d have
to be “kept down.”
"He is a naughty child,” they said, “a most
precocious brat.
To think good Mr. Bull should have an
offspring such as that!”
But Bill, despite the stern rebukes of aider-
men and Wowsers,
Defied the crowd.
And shouted loud :
"Shut up! I want me trousers /”
Now, in the course of time, John Bull
awakened to the fact
That, in the interests of his sons, ’twas time
for him to act.
“My dear,” he said, “these sons of ours are
growing quite immense ;
We ought to have a business talk —I’ll call
a conference.
They’re nearly men; and they must learn,
each one, to stand alone,
Each with responsibilities, and a house-
hold of his own.
They can’t be always at our skirts, like
great, big, awkward gabies.”
“Why, Mr. Bull !”
She cried. “You fool!
Those boys are only babies!”
But at the meeting Mr. Bull spoke plainly
to his lads.
“My sons,” said he, “I don’t agree with all
your mother’s fads.
You can’t be always little boys ; like other
lads, you’ve grown ;
And now ’tis time to face the world, and
learn to stand alone.
We still remain one family ; and none will
fail, I know.
To aid another in distress, against a com-
mon foe.
Dear lads, I know, you’ll recollect —despite
success and riches—
Your father still.”
“Hear, hear!” said Bill—
“ Hooray ! I’ve got me breeches !”
Prom out that solemn conference Bill
marched in highest glee,
With more respect for Mr. Bull, now that
his limbs were free.
“The old man, he’s an all-right sort, and
talks sound, common sense.
It’s time we learned to act like men, and
chucked this fool-pretence.
We’ve done with apron-strings at last. But
what will Ma say now?
Her Wowsers and her aldermen? Lord,
won’t there be a row!
They’ve pecked at me quite long.enough ; it’s
up to me to scare ’em.
They’ll howl for weeks!
But here’s me breeks ;
An’, spare me days, I’ll wear ’em !”
The Wowsers and the aldermen and Mrs.
Jingophine
Were seated in the drawing-room when Bill
came on the scene.
"He's got 'em on!” a Wowser cried. “He’s
disobeyed his ma !”
“Help! Murder!” shrieked the aldermen.
“He’ll kill his pore, dear pa !”
Pell-mell they rushed to Mr. Bull—“Oh,
sir, that dreadful Bill !
He’ll murder you! He’s stole yer pants!
He’s got ’em on ’im still!
He’s wearin’ of ’em like a man!” ... “Ah,”
Mr. Bull said. “Is he?
There, there, good folk,
You’ve had your joke.
Now, go away; I’m busy.”
But, up and down the land they went, the
Wowsers and the rest;
And Bill, besides the trousers, sported now
a coat and vest.
“He’s dressin’ like a man!” they shrieked.
“He’s going to resist
His dear, kind pa! Oh, who'll restrain this
rank disloyalist?
He won’t take sops from ’is fond ma; ’er
pore ’art’s nearly broke !
He’s even gone an’ scoffed at us; an’ treats
us as a joke!”....
And if you chance to come across those
aldermen and Wowsers
You’ll find them still
Abusing Bill,
Who grins, and wears the trousers.

Acting-Premier Watt is on the track of
a large-sized trouble. The various “-Liberal”
leagues, scenting a State election about
November, have been selecting “approved”
candidates to meet the Labor attack. These
candidates must have their credentials en-
dorsed by the district leagues, which means
that the candidate will have to keep the
league in his mind’s eye pretty constantly if
he wants to hold his billet. Now Watt
wants to know where he and the Ministry
come in. At Geelong, one league selected a
candidate without consulting the local branch
ot the Wimmin’s Fashionable League or the
Ministry, and trouble has been loudly
threatened. Watt says that as the selected
candidates are to be his supporters he should
have a say in the selection. To this the
reply is that Watt is only an accident, and
the individual candidates are the concern of
the district leagues alone. It is quite easy to
see what will happen if the leagues can beat
Watt. It means that they will have the fate
and constitution of the Ministry in their
hands. They can pledge their candidate,
just as the Labor leagues do; and, though
they wildly denounce the practice followed
by Labor, it is almost a certainty that they
will follow suit.
« .
Jimmie Pannikin, on the campaign
against cow-slavery:—
I°r months I have been delivering lectures and
addresses to parents and residents in the Man-
ning district, not only in the larger centres of popu-
lation, but in the wee, isolated settlements. The
audiences have been large and usually enthusiastic. In
not one instance has there been a dissentient voice, for
the average Manning dairy-farmer likes a man who
will meet him face to face. Recently I spoke to 29
farmer folk in a farmer’s house, 25 miles out of
going-ahead Gloucester. The most popular of all the
lectures and addresses is: “The Power and Place of
Play m Child Culture.” The mean, miserable and
malicious minority, finding that public opinion is
fitting the cap of cruelty and callousness to children
upon them, have been deliberately distorting my
words, and .attacking me in the local papers, from
behind the safe but shameful shelter of pen-names.
Though invited to come out in the open like manly
men and sign their names to their letters, as I have
done, to mine, they still skulk behind the hedge of
anonymity.
It is most illuminating to note that these seekers
of shameful shelter have not attempted to criticise
Lord Dudley’s remarks at the Ulmarra Show, the
Scotch Commissioners’ report {vide “The most sor-
rowful sight in the Commonwealth”), the Daily
Telegraph’s article ridiculing the “flabby sentiment”
assertion, nor the S. M. Herald’s remark: “Yet, be-
hind all this is the fact that young children are being
cruelly treated in some cases in the dairying in-
dustry ; .and the public conscience demands that this
•shall end.” There are humanitarians engaged in
dairying, and they do most heartily , desire the
scandal to be ended; so do all who loyally love
young Australia.
One welcome sign of the arousing of the best and
wholesomest sense of the community is the number of
writers who agree with the uncompromising attitude
I have adopted towards the cow-child slavery, or any
other form of child degradation and deterioration.
As the Telegraph puts it: “The statements as to
the manner in which some unfortunate bush children
were being brought up are not the allegations of
irresponsible agitators or flabby sentimentalists, but
of trustworthy public servants, particularly school-
inspectors.” No flabby apologies for slave-driving
will serve any cause in this land. The best service
which anyone can render the farmers would be to
help them to get rid of any taint of child-slavery
which, owing to the less scrupulous few, does hang
about the industry, bringing undeserved discredit on
the mass. My action in obtaining official returns
concerning dairy-farm children’s' hours of rising and
retiring, average number of cows milked, other dairy
work, etc., was furiously denounced by some, who
were anxious to avoid the light of investigation;
and there were actually parents who said publicly
that their children were little liars, who would not
tell the truth concerning their hours and their work
on dairy-farms. It must surely be an awful curse
to have children who are chattels and liars; but it
is more surely an incomparably awfuller curse to
children to have parents who are cold-blooded,
callous, contemptible slave-drivers.
In conclusion, let me quote C:harlotte P. Gil-
man’s lines on “Child Labor” :
“No' fledgling feeds the father bird !
No chicken feeds the hen!
No kitten mouses for the cat —
This glory is for men.
We are the wisest, strongest race—-
Loud may our praise be sung!
The only animal alive
That lives upon its young!”
as the son, and grandson, and great-grandson of
farmer-folk (both on the paternal and maternal
side), I ask all child-lovers in the Commonwealth
to do all that in them lies to take sure but sudden
steps for the rescuing of a great industry from the
parlous position of supplying “one of the saddest
sights in the Commonwealth.”

“0.K.”: A lot is heard about the under-
rating of propputy-owners in the districts of
Victoria. Here is an instance of how the
under-rating of landlords in Melbourne may
victimise the tenants. A new house at St.
Kilda is rented at £6O a year on the usual
terms—municipal rates chargeable to the
landlord. The Metropolitan Board of Works
fixes a w'ater-meter in the garden, which
means that, under the usual terms of agree-
ment, the tenant has to pay for any water
used in excess of the house-rate, which latter
is due from the landlord. The water con-
sumption of a house that contains a large
family, or a number of boarders, is expected
to somewhat exceed the limit if the inmates
are addicted to washing themselves and
watering the garden. But in the instance
quoted, the household is small; nevertheless
the “excess” water-rate for the first year was
greater than the charge against the propputy-
owner. Why? Because the new house,
rented at £6O a year, was rated by the St.
Kilda Council at only £32 a year, and the
water-rating by the Melbourne Metropolitan
Board of Works was in accordance with the
municipal rating. Practically the two powers
are, in such frequent cases, conspiring to
rob tenant Peter in order to supply the
deficiencies of landlord Paul. Apparently
the municipal rating of this new propput.v
was considered too scandalously low, for it
was raised to £46 for the second year. The
water rate of the M.M.O.W. being raised
in proportion, the charge for excess con-
sumption against the tenant will be less. But
the landlord, to equalise matters, proposes to
raise the rent of the £46-rated house from
£6O to £65.

The Bulletin, after an additional seven
days’ consideration, has no more fault to find
with the show than it had last week, which
was none at all; and the only advice it has
to offer is to those who propose going to
Saturday’s matinee —book ! Last Saturday
afternoon this paper thought it had mis-
takenly walked into a “Liberal” Wimmin’s
League during an election campaign, where
free cakes and ale, music, the delighted-I’m-
sure handshake, and the Jack Johnson
smile were being lavishly distributed to all
cpmers in furtherance of the command, “Do
good by stealth.”

Howls, cheers, pistol shots, and the stamp-
ing of stage horses, villains and other ani-
mals indicate nightly to passers-by that
“The Man from Outback” is still living the
strenuous life at Sydney Criterion. Bellow-
drama will pervade this playhouse for the
next 10 days, when the more restful art of
Ethel Irving is due to arrive.

At Cripple Creek, it seems, the cure for
nearly everything is a gun; and Heaven
only knows how the live population of the
Western States has managed to increase so
much. For, of course, George Marlow pic-
tures things as they are and were; it would
be a wanton reflection on Adelphi marlow-
dramk to suggest anything else. In those
mining camps the world is divided into
three parts—the devilishly bad, the
angelically good, and the humorous ac-
cident (and the humorous accident is
angelically good between jokes.) As the

superlatively bad always get in the way
of a gun or other fatal disease about 10.40
p.m., the population of the mining camp,
though it has a tendency to dwindle, must also
have a tendency to become amazingly virtu-
ous in its old age. In the circumstances, one
can’t understand why the survivors always
stand between the jam-tins and the goats and
the wild-cats, and talk of “the good old
days.”
In many respects, “At Cripple Creek”
is the best that Marlow has produced. It is.
moreover, played by a new company, Cecil
Mannering being the only one of the old lot
included. Vrtue is championed by a steady
miner, Joe Mayfield ; a rough dancing-saloon
owner is in Vice’s corner. Vice advertises
for a governess, and a girl from N’York
answers. Of course when she wants to go
home to mother, she' can’t. The plot is
mainly about her struggles and those of three
other girls who have got into the hands of
the villains. Plots of all kinds are made
against Joe, who has come to the girls’
rescue ; but the usual phenomenal In-
dian discovers them all, and they are
frustrated. It is the Indian who in
the end has the unholy joy of killing
the people who are better dead, as they are
trying to stop the wedding of Joseph and the
girl from N’York. Cecil Mannering, though
he has some warm rounds-, never mislays his
punch, and never loses the sympathy of the
crowd. Of course, he is Joe. Martin
Mason (R. W. Riley) and Manuel Alvarez
(C. R. Stanford) are the two best villains,
Martin as the boss and Manuel as the bully
of the saloon. The Indian, Wahketah (T. E.
Tilton), only worries the audience once, and
that is when he tells an over-long story of
his lost love. Ben White, the nigger barman,
drops in some liall-marked humor, and doesn’t
make it too painful. Ada Guilford comes
back as “Dynamite Ann,” and Ida Gresham
is the girl from New York; and both do very
well with their pretty-raw material.

The Blascheck-Wrighton pair are still en-
couraging the hardy traveller to take map,
compass, dog, lantern and staff and fare forth
in search of the Y.M.C.A. Hall; and that re-
mote monastery is nightly filled with de-
lighted pilgrims. The extensive repertoire
of the entertainers enables them to vary their
bright little show so that the most consistent
attender is always sure of hearing something
new. The trouble is that he usually wants
to hear the same items again.

Sydney Tivoli acquired two new turns last
week-end. One of them is supplied by Carl-
ton Max, a ventriloquist whose performance
would be brighter if he could get some new
patter. The usual dummy which he holds on
his knee says things smartly ; but most of the
things have been said before. The other new
arrival is Sydney Bach, a sprightly young
drawing-room entertainer who dresses in
strange clothes and sings to his own piano
accompaniment—sometimes with his back to
the keyboard. Pie also plays the bass part of a
brief tune with his left hand while he pecks
out the treble with his nose. It is asserted
that Paderewski once fractured his skull
trying to do this trick. Impersonator Lam-
berti, Pastor and Merle, Emile Lazern (illu-
sionist), Marguerite Ismay and trio, Fanny
Powers and Ted Kalman are the other capi-
talists of the programme. This (Thursday)
evening, Alexander Prince, the concertina
player, returns for a brief season. On Satur-
day, the signboards of Clarke and Mostol, a
comedy pair, and Louise • Tracy, billed as
“The Dapper Dandy Bov,” will be presented
by the brisk youth who darts from the wings
and escapes without applause.

Two new turns burst on the patrons of
Sydney Amphitheatre last Saturday night.
Eva Mudge is an artist who, did she but
sing as well as she executes lightning
changes, would approach the Melba class.
Fritz Christian plays on a silver violin part
of the time; when he is not employed that
way he circulates shovels and kitchen
utensils in a diverting manner. Millie
Doris has a couple of new songs that no
Wowser could listen to unmoved, and the
Piquays are doing excellent work.
** * *
The thin edge of the vaudeville wedge is
being pushed into Sydney picture theatres.
Now y , besides films, the programmes for the
two Colonial theatres include harp and cor-
net solos by various senors, herrs, etc., who
are probably Bill and Jim after business
hours. The Lyric hasn’t started any “ex-
tras” yet, but it seems to be only a matter of
time and competition. “La Jacquerie,” the
Lyric’s star, is a picture of the “good old
times” when it was easier to lose a head
than find a dinner. “Raising Sunken Ves-
sels” is an interesting French picture, and
Tontolini provides one of his usual comedies.
This (Thursday) evening Sydney will have
a chance to see aeroplanes being manufac-
tured pn the Lyric screen. Colonial No. 1
patrons have been revelling in an exciting
bull fight; find Bathe’s “Australian Gazette,”
more gartering of the Prince of Wales, and
a harp solo have kept the billy boiling at
Colonial 2. The change at this house in-
cludes a submarine picture, “Life in Coun-
try Ponds,” “Scenes around Lyons,” and
more harp.

The “Literary Theatre” in Adelaide opened
a new stage in the club-room with four little
plays of a size suited to its dimensions.
There was a Schnitzlerette, the one in which
a demure young matron shows curiosity as
to , Anatol’s latest “little girl,” and finally
sends her the highly-suggestive message,
“Tell her I might have been'as happy as
s }s e ls it I had been less of a coward.” Rov-
ston Marcus showed once again that he is
the m an to play the careless, pol-
ished Anatol. The remaining plavs were bv
Australians. Louis Esson’s “Woman
.Lamer is an amusing scene from “push”
society, but it wanted much brisker plavine
)u an S ot , .4 I®o* 1 ® 0 * although Esson 'has
thoughtfully published a glossary with his
play, the audience naturally hadn’t it, and
so did not get the strength of the spruiking
when Bongo’s bit of fluff was worded bv a
John. Further, although the language had
already been fumigated a bit, there were still
altogether too many words beginning with
B and D and capital G to set before such an
audience. A writer of Esson’s calibre ought
to be able to indicate the atmosphere with-
out all this. That the action “dragged” was
not the author’s fault. Koehler’s “Board at
Variance” is a clever trifle for two ladies
and Wilfrid Neill’s “Web of Steel”-also by
an Adelaide man —an intense 20 minutes of
love and strategem and revolver. The chief
honors of the evening went to Thomas Nave,
the Walsh brothers, and Miss Robin—a fin-
ished artist.

Y.M.C.A.
HALL.
Clarke and Mostol, making their first Aus-
tralian appearance at Adelaide Tivoli, have
nothing new to show, but their step-dancing,
single or double, is very good, and their
cross-talk amusing. (“1 planted a dead cat
in my garden, and up came —a sanitary in-
spector.”) Reichen’s astonishing dogs still
hold on to improbable positions by their
eyelids, and Charmeroy, at the piano, com-
mands respectful attention rather than wild
enthusiasm. The Plimmer-Denniston Co.
has had a successful week at the Royal with
“Lover’s Lane,” a “pretty” play, badly dam-
aged by being wantonly given an English
setting. Who is responsible for thus per-
verting Clyde Fitch’s work? In characters,
situations and language it is Yankee at
every turn. The acting is admirable all
round. The hardy annual, “A Message from
Mars,” is starting the season’s last week.
Elsewhere, everything is Pictures, almost
uncountable, with the Empire perhaps most
prominent, by reason of a “Fatal Wedding”
film, during which a real Tin-can Band
makes real noise behind the scenes.
The scenic effects of Act 3, dealing with
“property” vessels on a stormy mimic sea,
strike one as the most valuable assets of
“Via Wireless,” staged at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s last _ Saturday. Otherwise this
homceopathicised melodrama is strong in
nothing save intervals. True the acting is
mostly praiseworthy, as far as it goes, but it
doesn’t go far towards persuading reasonable
beholders that Mr. Durant’s steel-works could
ever have prospered under'a proprietor who
pays enormous “royalties” to non-existent
inventors, and a manager who tears around
A ROMANCE OF THE SINGING SPARK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I went to “Via Wireless,” the night was damp and
dark,
Methought the play was musical, you bet!
It was said to be the Romance of a certain Singing
Spark,
So I went although the e-ven-ing was wet—
Tiddle-e-um.
What 0! My disappointment when a drama came
to pass,
Stocked with ghosts of Blandolt’s kindred, old
and young;
Forging guns, instead of “papers,” was the plot-
work, and, alas!
The Singing Spark’s Romance was never sung —■'
Never sung, all the time,
Not in prose, nor in rhyme—
Ne’er a bar of music rippled from his tongue ;
And the show that passed before us
Had no ballet girls nor chorus,
For the Singing Spark’s Romance was never sung.

ttl s fm'buces looking for liquor and gore.
Ihe absurdities of plot range from mild
furious, and are studded with scientific
technicalities nearly as tiresome as the
comic relief. When the British Admiralty
orders an inquiry into the cause of the fatal
explosion of Lieut. Somers’s naval gun
(which looked rather like the mantle of an
incandescent gaslight as it came from the
iurnace), the inquiry is conducted by a de-
tective from Scotland Yard; and when an
angry elderly penitent casts evil reflections
on the dandy manager-in-chief, the ’tec. ar-
rests that reputable citizen right away, with
the promptitude of an autocratic Hawkshaw.
But though probability stands aloof from
the plot, it brightens some of the dialogue
in “V la Y\ ireless.” Lionel Atwell as the
songless “Spark”; Bryant as the lurid
drunk; Maurice Dudley as the assistant
whom he casually hammers ; Miss Kerry as
the hard, sweet heroine; and Miss Alexander
and others work conscientiously in the des-
perate cause of romance. And Ambrose
Manning, as the doleful penitent who in-
vented another gun. shows all the force and
pungency of style which made him a popular
Caesar Cregeen in the old days of “The
Manxman.”

With only one more week left to conclude
the season, “Lady Frederick” draws crowds
to Melbourne Royal. The Irish widow smil-
ing at her liabilities, snorting at her accusers,
or putting on her complexion with both
hands in the fierce light that beats upon her
dressing-table, is the woman of the hour. And
Miss Ethel Irving is the woman. Her per-
sonality wins forgiveness for certain extrav-
agancies in the comedy and weaknesses in the
cast. The best specimens of the co. that
Miss Irving brought from London were prom-
inently displayed—in the previous piece—like
the biggest strawberries in a Dago’s punnet.
In this comedy the leading man, Stephen
Ewart, is a fine helpmate to the star, and
two or three minor parts are very well done;
hut the rest of the performers had been
better collected in Melbourne than brought
from London. Which fact, although gener-
ally remarked, makes no difference to the
gate-money receipts. The 3-act comedy of
humor, cynicism and sentiment, followed bv
the human episode of “Dolly’s Little Bills,”
will keep things busy at the Royal until
Thursday of next week. On Saturday
comes “The Chocolate Soldier.”

The new theatrical combiners, whose part-
nership starts with the coming month, is now
pointing to the grand climax of their compe-
tition as evidence that the time had arrived
for stopping it. On August 25 11. B. Irving
and co. (J.C.W.) will bump up against “The
Chocolate Soldier” (C. and M.) in Mel-
bourne, where also the J.C.W. production of
“The Balkan Princess” had been threatened
for the same date. In Sydney the Melba
Opera Co. is due to distract attention from
Ethel Irving a week after she has arrived.
The combine now deplores these irrevocable
plans, of battle, and, alas ! it will take care
that the public of neither city shall ever
again get two or three very high-toned shows
in acute rivalry.
"LADY FRED-
ERICK," at Mel-
bourne Royal.

(Warburton

at Melbourne Royal.

At the King’s a loquacious young man in
clerical attire is still rushing around and
immersing his face in mugs of beer. Also, a
frantic heroine, in a bright, bronze wig, con-
tinues to wail about a past that has never
commenced. In many respects this lady is
the most depressing item in the good old
drama of “Tommy Atkins.” ' Fctr, unlike
people in the play who pretend to be good,
she goes about pretending to be hopelessly
bad, though investigation shows that she has
all the simplicity and most of the virtues of
a confirmed Bishop.
** * *
Clarke and Hamilton, the principal new-
comers at the Opera House this week, are
identical with a turn of long ago as regards
Clarke only. The Hamilton in this instance
is a pretty little lady in gaudy harems, who
feeds her partner with questions and com-
ments until he has pattered himself dry,
after which he plays a piano fluently, and
drops articles of food into its body. For-
merly Clarke was an unmitigated dead-beat
in his disguise. He is now less ragged, but
his methods are the same as before, and his
gags help to remind us that one good turn
covers a multitude of years. The business
of a variety entertainer has no variousness,
seemingly. The pantomimic Spissells, the
cyclists, the conjurers, and Albert Rees in
place of Sydney Bach, are’ other features of
an acceptable hill at the Rickards em-
porium.

The chief picture at West’s Building. Mel-
bourne, last week, was “The Bride of the
Nile,” which displayed some of the fads and
fatuities in the old Egyptian worship of the
goddess Isis. An exciting Anglo-African
drama, “Zululand,” was also filmed, with
lions, niggers, forests, and other interesting
properties. In addition to pictures, this
week West’s exhibited the Young Australia
League in a couple of concerts. These hearty
little citizens from Westralia are on their
way to America and other portions of the
more or less civilised globe.

The famous story of Radames, beloved of
Amneris and Aida, was' screened at the
Lyric, Prahran (Vic.), last Saturday night.
The piece was rather over-acted by Italian
mimes, one lady playing Amneris with a
force that nearly pushed her into farce.
Aida, however, was nicely portrayed by a
younger woman, who was natural in all she
did. The much-advertised feature of the
Lyric bill this week is the local drama.
“Moora-Neeya,” which pictures the bush
with a reality,so intense that the audience
wants to get up and boil a billy.
AT POVERTY POINT.
J. 0. Williamson seems to have rushed the thea-
trical combine of J. C. Williamson, Ltd., and Clarke
and Meynell, Ltd., so as to cover the extremely
speculative engagement of the Melba Operatic Co.,
which will practically baptise the new partnership
in song.. It is hard to say whether the combine
will tend to raise the tone of theatrical productions.
The competition between the rival firms was certainlv
doing very well in that way, thanks to the spirited
bidding of Clarke and Meynell, who created a Shale-
speare boom by importing Oscar Asche, and shook
up things in comic opera by engaging entirely new
companies, more or less specially adapted to at
least one production. Their “Arcadians” and “Hook
of Holland” were, for that reason, the freshest
musical shows Australia lias seen for vears, the long
run of the stereotyped “Our Miss Gibbs” being, by
comparison, an unaccountable triumph of the com-
monplace,. Again, the Clarke and Meynell' engage-
ment of the Ethel Irving Co: promises “to create an
Australian popularity for comedies of a quieter kind
—depending more on the quality and the style of
the acting—than Brough and Boucicault used to
supply in their palmy days to a loyal but limited
following. Altogether the Clarke and Meynell com-
petition has been boldly experimental in com-
parison with the Williamson endeavors to check it.
Henceforth, however, there is to be no more compe-
tition, and the efforts of the combine may or may
not be devoted rather to “giving the public what it
wants” than to teaching it to want something better.
Competition is sure to lean towards artistic experi-
ment. Monopoly isn’t. And the monopoly’s com-
petitors will not for a long time be in a position to
do good things in a vety expensive way.
“D.”: Sydney Telegraph, in an approving leader
on the new arrangement whereby the J. C. William-
son and Clarke-Meynell theatrical businesses are
merged, had this to say: “Hitherto those astute
people in England and the United States who had
attractive theatrical merchandise to offer were able
to play off one Australian manager against another...
However, by the buyers coming together, the foreign
seller is obliged to take the price that is offered or
else leave it.” It was, presumably, the best the
Telegraph could do on the subject; but it omitted
to mention the fact that, not only will the foreign
seller now have to take what is offered, or leave it,
but the Australian public will be in the same in-
vidious position. The new concern has control of
practically every decent-sized playhouse in Austral-
asia. One may safely say, therefore, that Aus-
tralia’s theatrical combine is secure from competi-
tion. That being so, it may charge London prices
(stalls 10s. 6d., dress circle 7s. 6d., boxes three to
five guineas), or it may present rotten shows and
suppress criticism by excluding candid writers, or
follow any one of a dozen other undesirable prac-
tices which have been rife in America, the birthplace
of the theatrical Trust, these 10 years. It is of
course true that, with conscientious artists such as
Williamson, Ward and Meynell running things, there
is no immediate likelihood of any of these un-
pleasantnesses occurring. But directorates change,
and Trusts have a way of attracting folks who are
out after big profits, to the exclusion of all other
considerations. A brief five years may find Aus-
tralian playgoers heartily cursing the present rap-
prochement between the managements whose rivalry
has done so much, of late, to raise the standard of
local productions. In fact, if Trust history is re-
peated, that is what must inevitably happen.
“Snell”: “C. Ockney’s” latest retort re the right-
eousness of slavish imitation in stage art is a
whine about my weapons, and
an impudent mis-statement of
my facts (B. 27/7/’lI). When
“Miss Gibbs” was first staged
in Melbourne, many; people—
pressmen among the rest —
watched one conspicuous per-
former through a whole act,
believing him to be a come-
dian they had already seen in
several musical comedies.
When light was thrown on the
programme in the interval,
the name of a stranger was
found to be attached to that
particular part. The fact is
both actors are accurate imi-
tators of a third. This, on
top of a certain figurative
similarity, led to the confu-
sion. If “C. Ockney” is con-
tent with that sort of thing,
and demands no special per-
sonality of an artist, he is
welcome to his choice, but I
hope, for the sake of the
game, he will presently have
to rely upon the music-hall
for his delectable entertain-
ment.
A BIT OF BRITISH
SOLDIERY IN
"TOMMY A THINS,”
AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Said Hugh J. Ward: “The whole point about this
amalgamation of the J. 0. Williamson firm and the
Ularke-Meynell proprietary is that the demands made
by artists or companies before they would agree to
tour this country were becoming altogether unreason-
able. By playing one firm off against the other, ex-
travagant terms were made. Royalty holders and
others, taking advantage of the situation, could
practically hold a gun to our heads, and demand their
own price, and, as a matter of fact, everything was
pushed up to break-neck price before the pro-
tecting amalgamation arrived. The strain will ease
off now. I’ve heard it said that the amalgamation is
some sort of wicked trust on the lines of the Meat
Ring, and that the public will not be treated as
well in future as it was under the competition that
has hitherto existed. All 1 can say in reply to that
is that those who argue that way can know nothing
of the business. We’ve got our theatres; we’ve got
to fill them ; and if we don’t keep up the standard —
yes, and better it —we won’t fill ’em. No good tell-
ing me —I know all about it. If we put on a good
show at, say, the Royal, and a weak one at Her
Majesty’s or the Criterion, what does the public do ?
What would you expect it to do? Exactly. And
that’s what it would do, with the sweetest and most
enthusiastic disregard for anybody but itself. We’ve
got to fill all our theatres, and we can only do that
by offering the public sufficient inducement to crowd
into them. The new amalgamation, far from being
detrimental to the Australian stage, will be a guar-
antee of producing upon it the very best goods, but
with this difference —we won’t have to get up a lad-
der to talk business with controllers at the other
end.”
Frank Rigo, stage manager for the forthcoming
Melba opera season, is in Sydney, having a look
over Her Majesty’s, and a preliminary discussion with
the experts in charge of the various departments.
So far, he is more than pleased; he is surprised.
“In America, you know,” he remarked the other
night, “everything is made as convenient as pos-
sible on the back—fold-up effects, for instance, so
that you can close them and put them away like a
book when you have done with them. Here, I expected
to find everything clumsy and crude, like Covent
Garden was last time I was there —-Covent Gar-
den with stage hands falling over one another; I’ve
even seen them lying on the stage on a Saturday
night. You wouldn’t see it anywhere else. America ?
Well, I come from there, and it’s not for me to say;
but I’ll go this far. They pay their hands well and
get experienced men. Here, everything seems all
right and up to date, and the fittings are similar in
the matter of convenience to those of America. And
the property man—he’s got this” (tapping his brain-
box impressively). All of which is better than a
hit in the eye from the man who stage-managed for
Melba in the Metropolitan Opera House, New York.
“Lud”: Ethel Irving’s playlet, “Dolly’s Little
Bills,” by Jones, is obviously founded on “My
Milliner’s Bill,” which Mrs. John Wood played in
London. Miss Irving wanted to act the piece at a
London music-hall, but Jones objected, and even
threatened an injunction. Considering that Bern-
hardt, Potter and Langtry have acted in music-
halls, Jones is queerly sensitive. But all authors
and managers have their fads.
“C. Ockney” (another version): “Dolly’s Little
Bills,” the 11. A. Jbnes playlet which Ethel Irv-
ing is staging in Melbourne, is a boil-down of the
author’s full-length comedy, “Dolly Reforming Her-
self,” played a few seasons ago at the Hay-
market. When Miss Irving made a short excursion
into London music-hall stardom last year she was
billed to do this “sketch”; but finding that it ex-
ceeded the time-limit (and “sketch-prosecutions”
were just about then costing vaudeville managers a
small fortune), she had to shelve it. Jones was
quite cross about it, and —strangely enough—wrote
letters to the press on the subject.
A score or less of Wowsers, meeting in the Bap-
tist Hall, Melbourne, the other night, passed the
drollest resolution in the history of the Church. It
seems that a picture drama called “Sextus the
Fifth” moved a foolish R.C. journal to suggest
that any show offering such “insults” to the
Faith should be boycotted by all obedient Catholics.
Apparently the Wowsers knew nothing whatever
about this particular flickerdrama, except that an
R.C. journal had objected to its sectarian character.
If it was offensive to “Popery,” then it mhst be
the sort of picture they were dying to see. So they
uttered a long resolution, concluding as follows:
“While this council deprecates the Papal boycott, it
,may so happen, in defence of citizen rights, that
Protestants may have to meet Romanism with its
own favorite weapons, and patronise those picture
shows the management of which cater for the public
education along historical lines, irrespective of the
Papal system boycott.” Here, then, is a chance for
a picture showman to run up the Yellow flag at his
masthead; and advertise a weekly change of pro-
gramme, in which the Errors of Rome will be always
to the fore. Those pictures, of course, would be
always “educational.”
“Cockaigne”: “Louis XL” is indeed dried up for
femininity. Ellen Terry wouldn’t act in it in Lon-
don, and I don t think Irving asked her. But Mrs.
Kean acted the part of the elderly peasant woman,
as a sort of joke, and the scene between her and
Charles became peculiarly—well, call it unctuous.
“Propstick”: “Louis X 1.,” by Casimir Delavigne',
was first acted in the Paris Theatre Frangais, with
Ligier as the King. C. Kean saw Ligier, and per-
ceived at once that the part was cut out for himself.
The greatest treat of Cathcart’s life, was acting
Nemours to Kean in the great bed-chamber scene
where the sympathy is all with Nemours. W. E.
Sheridan anil \ incent acted this scene well in Mel-
bourne. On the first night Vincent was noisy, but
on the second Sheridan had shown him how to be
more effective with quiet intensity. Brooke acted
Louis XI. for the first time in Melbourne, and made
a deep impression. There is a life-size wall placard
of him, by Frisbee, which used to be trotted out for
the guidance of other Louis the Elevenths. Henry
Irving essayed the part during Mrs. Bateman’s man-
agement, and it caught on. The merits of his Louis
and Kean’s were on a see-saw. “H. 8.” seems to make
up a little older than his father. The person you
see in the play, by the way, is not the historical
Louis XL, who appears to have had democratic
sympathies, and was, in consequence, traduced by
the Fat men of the period. Delavigne, the author,
belonged to the political party that wanted to shift
Louis Phillipe from the French throne, and end the
monarchy; so he first of all selected a monarch
with a dark record, and then proceeded to dip that
record in pitch.
“Gwy”: Regarding the dramatised version of
“Faust,” H. B. Irving made a bad break in an in-
terview, when he said “he understood that the dra-
matised version had never been produced in Aus-
tralia, although the operatic version had been given.”
As a matter of fact, Irving’s “first performance”
will be about half a century after the actual
first. Charles Kean produced a dramatised
“Faust” in Australia in the early ’6o’s ; and George
Rignold’s “Faust,” produced in March, 1888, at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, was a gorgeous spectacle.
Rignold presented a very original Mephistopheles;
Darley was Faust and Kate Bishop Marguerite. Sir
Gilbert Parker, then plain Parker and a leader-
writer on the S. M. Herald, dramatised the opera
for Rignold. Irving’s “Faust,” of course, will be
the version his father used and made a pot of money
out of.

v 1902-3), and afterwards replaced Hugh Ward in
the Frawley co., was married the other day in the
U-nited States to Miss Jane Wheatley, a well-known
leading woman of the Schubert forces. Herbert
went to S’Africa with Frawley, and after a while
spent in England passed on to America with Nat
Goodwin as juvenile lead in “Beauty and the Barge.”
As hitherto remarked, the Sheffield Choristers are
not wallowing in luxury. It is said that Lady Norah
Noel and the Viscount, having discovered that the
tour is not a picnic, are leaving the choir; but the
poorer brethren and sistern are bound to hang to-
gether to the bitter end.
“S.S.”: Very amateurish was the opening per-
formance of the Denmans (and suite) at Melbourne
Royal. The new G.-G., his partner, the bodyguard
and its wives occupied two boxes, and the whole
conduct of , the vice-regal gathering screamed for
efficient stage-management. The Denmans have not
had extensive official experience. The fact was
obvious in their distrait bearing, awkward grouping,
and painfully nervous sense of being on show. Imma-
ture supers in a drama often look like that, and I
would advise that, in the future, unaccustomed
Governors be given the benefit of expert tuition and
numerous private rehearsals before being exhibited
before a large and censorious Australian audience.
Nat Goodwin, who has had several helpings of
matrimony, seems to be annoyed with Edna Good-
rich, his latest acquisition in model wives. He has,
at any rate, asked a U.S. court to return him the
fortune which lie settled upon the lady.
Stated that American vaudeville is shortly to be
invaded by Ella Wheeler Wilcox, who has made the
English language misbehave in reams upon reams
of marmalade verse. Ella, presumably, will recite
“The Birth of the Opal,” with stage sunlight and
moonlight effects.
“X. 0.”: Lamberti’s turn at the Tivoli sets me
wondering why an Australian with a trick for im-
personation doesn’t get on to Australian politicians.
Thousands of people in the various States are
interested in Parliamentarians, who are known
to them only through their printed utter-
ances and the cartoon or the process-block. Fisher,
Hughes, McGregor, Bruce Smith, Cook, Wade,
McGowen, Verran, and a host of others have faces,
accents, mannerisms, or other peculiarities that
lend themselves to impersonation. With a clever
journalistic collaborator, little speeches might be
faked to bring out each man’s characteristics or
idiosyncrasies. Personally, if an imported mimic
put on Balfour, Lloyd-George, Roosevelt, or other
older-world political identities, I would enjoy them
as much as the host of impersonations we get of
theatrical identities.
They have their own ideas about musical criticism
in America. Here is a fresh breeze from a New
York paper’s puff about a world’s greatest piano-
sparrer: “If the gibbering, grimacing figure of
had appeared at the end of a long stick, instead of
being seated at the ivory end of a grand piano, no-
body would have been surprised. Nothing but regard
for the rules of Carnegie Hall prevented me from
offering a bag of peanuts to the little man of pre-
hensile habits.”
“J.”: How a moderately comfortable theatre
would boom in Australia ! In it provision would be
made against the freezing blasts which now whistle
past playgoers’ ears each time the whisky brigade
breaks cover. The seats would be broad and softly
upholstered, so that patrons, linking into them,
might imagine that they were by their .own firesides.
There would be room for the leggiest auditor to
stretch his limbs, and space for the stoutest in-
ebriate to barge past without stamping on anyone.
The house would be neither an influenza-factory in
winter nor a Turkish bath in summer. It would
attract people who for years have classed the theatre
with church, as a dreadful place where ease is not
and ventilation is unknown. And it could charge
pretty well what it liked, regardless of the tripe it
staged.
Miss Gertrude Palmer’s concert will occur in the
Y.M.C.A. Hall on Saturday evening, August 19.
FACT AND ADVERTISEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Thesp, manager, a man inspired,
His pen across the paper sent.
A while he paused, and much admired
The fine prose-poem, passion fired,
His latest press advertisement.
And then he dipped, and line by line
His composition grew in worth.
He wrote of Montague Devine,
His Leading Man, “an Artist Fine”—
“The Best Tragedian on Earth!”
The “Noblest Actor” since that time
When Garrick stirred old London’s heart;
And in “The Undertaker’s Crime”
He was “Sincere,” “Supreme,” “Sublime” . . .
Here Monty called the Boss apart.
He smiled a smile of acrid mirth.
“That little rise? ’Tis meet, I vow.”
“A rise?” yelled Thesp. “Get off the earth.
Why, dammitall, you aren’t worth
The thirty bob you’re getting now!”

SILAS.
HIS ART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was an actor of tragic parts.
I knew him well, and for many years
He shored a wall where the red tram starts;
A man he seemed with a load of cares,
And longings dire for the brewers’ wares.
He had no part of that vulgar pride
We find so oft in the artist clan ;
In smith or tinker he would confide —
He’d take a drink from an old tin-can ;
Accept refreshment from any man.
And yet he possessed “that touch sublime”
(He “touched” me oft when I met him first) ;
His talk was still of the splendid time
Ere stage and craft were by lucre curst,
And pros, were gentlemen at the worst.
He married then, to my great surprise.
When asked how ’twas that this came to be,
He fixed me fast, with his great, sad eyes.
“She runs a laundry, and now I’m free
To devote meself to me art,” said he.

SOCIETY
According to a letter received by a Sydney
man from a friend who lately visited Pales-
tine, the model colonies of Judea are flour-
ishing like an interest bill, and the Jews
therein spend peaceful days irrigating their
fruit groves with the aid of oil engines.
There are no church bells, gaols, policemen,
pubs, drunks or pawnshops ; everyone speaks
Hebrew, and the usual greeting is “Sholom”
(“Peace”), instead of “Veil, Ikey, how’s
peezness?” The absence of pawnshops is
doubtless due to the fact that there are no
Gentiles in the settlement. There are a few
Arabs; but when the Arab signs an IO U
he does it with a broad-bladed spear. Some-
times, in the Biblical twilight, a modern
Judean is discovered looking up at an over-
hanging branch of golden fruit with a far-
away look in his eye; afterwards he is heard
to groan, and the wanderer knows then that
Israel is thinking of his old profession.
A FASHION NOTE.
THE MEN: “Dear, dear! What an eccentric
dress!”
“The Pauper”: Re Comte de Fleurieu
and his tour of inquiry respecting early
French explorations on the Australian coast
(B. 3/8/T1). Can anyone throw some illu-
mination on the circumstances which at-
tended the landing of a British naval party
at Settlement Point (Western Port) in op-
position to the temporary French occupation
of French Island (Vic.)? The bastions on
which the cannon of the British party were
mounted are still visible, although it must be
over a century since they were formed.
An “Anglican Social Questions Commit
tee,” formed with a view to keeping the
Sabbath holy (and boozy) in Port Mel-
bourne, lately addressed the local Council rc
the sinfulness of Sunday picture shows.
The letter fell on stony ground, for part of
the Council w'as in favor of commending the
evil complained of, whereas the majority
decided to answer the letter with a stolid,
secular silence. It seems that police reports
and statistics in all the “rougher” sections
of Melbourne are favorable to Sunday pic-
ture shows, on the ground that they make
for law’n’order. Thus Williamstown, which
was a rowdy district when the pubs did
all the Sunday trading, has become much
better behaved since the shows began to
compete with the churches. The fact that
“pollution of the Sabbath” is reducing the
Monday list of drunks and disorderlies is,
however, so distressing to the godly that
they turn their eyes the other way: it is
one of the Anglican social questions which
are never broached.
The Argus attacks on Drystale Browui
wins that dun Attorney-General a momentary
respect. The paper which is in that place
where it is demanded of conscience to speak
the truth, ignores the demand most success-
fully in connection with a quarrel between
Brown and barrister Maxwell. While pre-
tending to whoop for Maxwell purely in the
interests of the poor client, the paper ob-
serves :
The Attorney-General, on behalf of the King, is
the prosecutor, and it is of the utmost importance,
if the accused person is to be assured of the full
benefit of legal assistance, that his counsel shall be
absolutely independent of the Crown.
That would be all right if it were not possi-
ble for the counsel to “dog” on the accused
person at the trial, and leave him to save his
wretched neck by his own devices.
The Argus holds that counsel should be in-
dependent of everybody and everything in the
interests of the client; consequently the
Minister who provides the fee is an insolent
intruder when he demands some guarantee
that counsel will at least turn up at the trial,
and give that client a fair chance to save his
neck.

Dr. Ham, chairman of Melbourne’s Board
of Health, proposed to deliver some scientific
lectures on Sunday evenings ; and the Holy
Josephs and Saintly Sallies at once snuffled
angrily. The “religious bodies” declared that
it would be scandalous Sabbath-breaking
and shockingly immoral for a public
official to tell people about their
bodies on the blessed day that should
be devoted to rapt contemplation of their
souls. Ham, of course, demurred. As
a doctor, he has not yet encountered a
patient with Bright’s disease of the soul,. or
consumptive symptoms in that vague region,
and he purposed delivering a few sermons on
lungs and kidneys and the other concrete
parts of man for a change. Yet the Wowser
is so much on top in Melbourne at present
that the Government, when appealed to, ad-
vised its public-spirited officer that he had
better drop his project, and let the people
flounder in darkness.

Pathetic but ungrammatical advt. in Melb.
Argus :
I, ARTHUR SNOOK, Sen., and Family, hereby
notify the public that on and after the 24th April,
1911, have taken the sirname of HARRIS,, myself
and wife, and Arthur Percy, William Allen, Leah,
Ernest, Frank, and Violet Mary. Arthur Snook.
One can picture the tragedy of it: —
One Norfolk Howard changed his name
From Bugg, because it brought him shame,
And thereby in the social game
Of cards he oft was euchred ;
So Harris, having fame in view,
From Bugg’s example took his cue
And struck a patronymic new,
Because he had been Snook-ered.
AT THE REGISTRY OFFICE.
"Did yer get a job, Miss?”
A recent High Court decision provided
still another unpleasant advertisement for
those responsible for the consolidation of
the N. S. Wales statutes. One Riddle, who
had discharged the contents of a revolver in-
to his wife, had been found guilty of at-
tempted murder, and sentenced. The only
witness of the assault was Mrs. Riddle, and
at the trial she flatly refused to give evi-
dence against her husband. The Chief Jus-
tice ordered her to do so, on the authority
of a previous well-known decision in the case
of the King v. Stocks. She then deposed to
the facts, and the jury’s part of the proceed-
ings was easy. But an appeal was made to
the High Court, on the ground that the con-
solidated Crimes Act (Section 407) gave a
wife, no matter how battered or per-
forated, the option of giving or with-
holding evidence against her husband,
the King and his friend Stocks not-
withstanding ; and the Court., having adjust-
ed its horsehair upholstery, and compared
the consolidated Act with the original
Crimes Act, agreed with the lady, and handed
back her husband, with the hangman’s re-
grets.
A S. M. Herald correspondent gave the
show away like this: —
Blacktown.—Tlie shortage of Chinese orchard
hands is causing growers much concern. Fruit-
growers are excited in mind over the increase in
wages to employees demanded by the Rural Workers’
Union. The ruling wage is from 12s. 6d. per week
and keep, to 30s. per week of 60 hours. In several
instances good workers receive 365. per week with
half a day on Saturdays ; but Chinamen, when avail-
able, receive from 18s. to 28s. per week of 66 hours,
and are provided with a hut, wood and water.
“The shortage of Chinese orchard hands is
causing growers much concern,” and then,
in view of the increased wages asked for by
the Rural Workers’ Union, we get some
figures to show how expensive the white
laborer is by comparison with the yellow
leper who pigs it in a hut provided by his
liberal employer. From this the public cau
arrive at one valuable conclusion. When
next time it hears the fruit cocky crying in
his agony that the demands of the Rural
Workers’ Union are monstrous, it will re-
member that the fruit-cocky’s standard of
value is not the white man, but the pestifer-
ous, hut-dwelling Chow.
That old part of the Flinders-street
(Melb.) railway station, east of Princes
Bridge, has just been knocked down and
carted away. The business that used to be
done there is done now in the new premises
at the Bridge corner, where the morgue
once stood. The station originally belonged
to the Melbourne Suburban Railway Co.
This in time amalgamated with the Hob-
son’s Bay Co., and then the Government
stepped in and swallowed the lot.

The scandalous policy of never mention-
ing one of the most awful and most conta-
gious diseases of man, and doing practically
nothing to stamp it out, had another bad
advt. in Maoriland the other day. The M.L.
Parliament was considering a Bill to deal
with “defectives” —mental defectives —when
Te Rangihiroa (Dr. Buck), a Maori member,
made one of his rare speeches. “Insanity
amongst the Maoris is less frequent than
among Europeans, which may be an argu-
ment against becoming too civilised,” said
Buck. “But insanity, even among the Maoris,
is on the increase, because of the presence of
a certain specific disease that was introduced
by the Europeans.” But though, as an old
Health officer, Dr. Buck knows what is the
matter, Maoriland seems far too Wowserous
at present to take the gloves off where this
disease is concerned. Instead, in the interests
of “social purity,” it allows the horrible
thing to stalk unmarked through the land,
producing lunatics, and smiting innocent
and “guilty” alike.
Fate —or whatever one chooses to call it—
was busy in the hills behind Adelaide one
afternoon last week. Some people had
bought land 40 miles out, and were motoring
down in a drag to vote at a local poll. The
vehicle, a big thing used to rough work,
snapped an axle on a good road, and, with
the brakes hard on, slowly broke through a
fence and started down a small bank. It
was a question of hold tight or jump. Either
might be best. All sat tight but one lady.
She jumped clear, but then slipped and
rolled down into a creek. The car turned,
like a malignant thing, and followed her!
In the bed of the creek it came to a stop,
with the broken axle crushing her chest.
And there it stayed for am hour—she was
dead instantly, it is hoped—till a passing
bullock-team could be caught to drag it off.
It takes a lawyer to be profane enough to
call a thing like that the Act of God.
THE SOFT ANSWER.
THE POET:“ I hear you've been saying that
my ‘Ballads of Beer’ is the worst book I
ever wrote."
THE CRITIC: “Oh, no, no! I wasn't so per-
sonal. I said the worst ANYONE ever
wrote. ”
Tile other day the Ma State unexpectedly
dropped 50 acres of Riverina land, which, iu
return for certain concessions, a local land-
owner had surrendered to the Crown. The
area, having been again made available, was
thrown open for selection; but, before the
date fixed for the closing of applications, a
volunteer land order was handed across (he
counter, and these 50 acres were demanded, ac-
cording to the arrangement made by the Ma
State in the long ago. That arrangement pro-
vided for a free grant of any 50 acres desired:
so although the local Land Board pulled a Ion?
face, there was nothing for it but to hand
over the block. These ancient instruments,
which for years past have had a habit of
flying up unexpectedly and hitting the State
in the eye, are timed to expire as legal ten-
ders early in 1912.
There was nothing wrong with a recent
land ballot at Dannevirke (Jew Zealand 1
except coincidence. The distribution of b'
sections depended upon the gamble,- and up-
wards of 500 home-seekers drew the marbles.
Six of the blocks went to local cow-squeezers
or their connections, and in two draws the
two daughters of a Dannevirke cocky secure!
two adjoining holdings. The 400-odd dis-
consolates then passed a resolution that in
future the acts of Providence ought to be
controlled by Acts of Parliament.
THE LAST DREAD SENTENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Justice Hodges’s refusal to adjourn Melbourne
Divorce Court for the usual midday luncheon period,
is having shocking results. Last week a lady witness
fell out of the box, for want of nourishment, it is
said, and a solicitor from up-country complained of
his Honor’s “inhumanity.” Further tragedies are
expected.
The Judge sat in the silent court
Serene and underfed ;
Hard fasting, which to him was sport,
Had killed the counsel dead ;
The co-respondent passed away
Whilst moaning, “Daily bread.”
Fat witnesses lay round about,
Their faces ghastly white;
The jury, quite relieved of doubt,
Had perished left and right;
Petitioner, respondent too—-
It was a gruesome sight.
A solemn undertaker came,
lie heaved a hearty sigh;
He jotted down each corpse’s name,
And placed a coffin nigh.
And then the Court arose, and said:
“Adjournment —sine die.”
On clust’ring graves the grass grows green,
A thick and verdant bunch,
And mourners, gazing o’er the scene,
Their biscuits sadly crunch,
And murmur: “May they rest in peace
Who died for lack of lunch!”

"R.B. on the Hop Poon Gooey business :
The missionary is at it again. Hop Poon Gooey,
of Geelong, applied for permission to bring his wife
from China, and, unfortunately, was granted it.
Mrs. Hop was to leave the country again in six
months, but was permitted an extension of residence
till after the birth of her child. And the child being
born she must now return, and all sorts of -soft-
headed, well-meaning busybodies are opposing the
observance of the law. One, the Bev. Paton, says:
"Several members of Parliament have expressed
their willingness to assist in any joint effort that
may, be made to rectify this harsh application of the
law.” The various missionary societies, which are
keenly interested in work among the Chinese, and
are expending considerable sums to Christianise
them, will, Mr. Paton thinks, strongly resent the
proceeding. So Australia has to be administered
from the view-point of some “foreign missionary.”
It was wrong to admit the woman in the first place ;
the deportation of the Chow is more desirable. Of
course, whole-caste is better than half-caste, but let
the whole-caste stay long enough and the half-caste
will arrive. Strangely enough, it is these church
people who seem unable to understand that a race
wants to stay clean. The missionary and the very
Anglican churchman, Justice Hodges, can weep over
the “un-Christian” law of excluding aliens and in-
feriors, but, apparently, give no thought to the
white people who are dirtied by contact with them.
At any rate, Hodges the other day tried a woman
named Robinson, and a jury found her guilty of the
filthiest of charges—three separate cases of selling
three girls to Chinese for ss. each, of which she
had 2s. 6d. a head, and the mean and lowly Hodges
said “It was a serious crime,” this of procuring
white virgins for Pongs, “and the maximum penalty
was two years on each charge, but he would be con-
siderate, and give her 12 months for the lot.” Pre-
sumably, he will be at one with busybody Paton
in agitating to retain the services of Mr. and Mrs.
Hop Poon Gooey! It is to be wished that Batchelor,
on whom the deputation of law-breakers is to by-
and-bye wait in the Hop Poon Gooey case, will tell
that deputation that its proper place is in melo-
drama- —where the policeman bursts into tears and
rips up the warrant for the hero’s arrest because the
fourth act proves that the hero and the policeman
are foster-sisters.

South Aus. doesn’t trouble much about the
ordinary Orange and Green dissensions.
When it falls out over theology, the ques-
tion is usually “Church” v. “Dissent.” The
quarrel of the moment is a semi-private one
concerning the wealthy Angas family, which
two generations back built a Congregational
church on the Angas land. The last gen-
eration endowed it with £2OOO. The present
generation, as so often happens, prefers to
be Anglican, and has handed over the church
to the Bishop, amid wild protests and
threats of lawsuits. The family has offered
the £2OOO endowment to the Congregation-
alists for general purposes; but as they
can’t also get their old tabernacle, they
have declined the filthy lucre, and there the
matter ends for the present.

“Cadonia”: “Tag” (B. 27/7/’l.l) is leni-
ent when he talks of- a “conspiracy of
silence” among teachers and trainers of Aus-
tralian youth in the matter of Aus-
tralian literature. “Conspiracy” implies
an amount of hard thinking. That is too
flattering. Coin, rather, a word that stands
for old-fashioned, stick-in-the-mud sloth, and
put it into currency. It is true that the
present “school readers” contain one or two
gems of Australian prose and poetry, but the
number of teachers who will recognise and
bring these before the pupils is so small that
Young Australia, as a rule, doesn’t know that
he has any writers of his own. Gordon’s “Sick
Stockrider,” for instance, appears in one of
the higher-class “readers” ; but for every one
teacher who makes use of it there are many
vvho not only shun it, but openly declare it
“doggerel,” calculated to spoil a growing
taste for true literature. And it is a fact
that, a few years ago, at the N. S. Wales
Teachers’ College, of 13 English texts set
down for the year’s study and examination,
12 only were dealt with. The lecturer shud-
dered visibly at mention of the thirteenth,
and students inquired after it in vain. For
it was entitled “An Anthology of Australian
\ erse.”

The annual insurance of the long panel pic-
tures and others in Melbourne Town Hall is
to be considerably reduced. The corpora-
tion's estimate of the value of those por-
traits of official finery, with elderly gentle-
man enclosed therein, has descended from
£5400 to £2200 at one fell swoop. Two or
three represent early Governors of Victoria,
clothed in loose whiskers and tight uni-
forms; one of the most striking appears to
be the late EitzGibbon heroically posed in
wig- and kneebreeches ; and many are paint-
ings of mayors robed in majesty and hung in
chains, and looking so exactly alike in figure
that an annual interchange of heads would
make no difference to their general effect.
Among these latter is little Weedon, who
protested vigorously against a lowering of the
insurance on himself and the rest. Sam
Gillott also protested, being one of the
painted Gaud Mayors. But the other mem-
bers of the gilt chain-gang are mostly dead,
so the councillors who are not likely to be
hung carried the resolution, and now the
whole lot of 66 pictures are valued at £2200,
which is an extravagant compliment to most
of the artists. The argument that the oldest
and longest-dead subjects are of great his-
toric value was met with a proposal to have
photos, taken of them all, so that in the
event of its destruction any original could
be replaced with a new painting from the
photo. Thus was Melbourne Town Hall
purged of its pretensions to rank as an art
gallery.

“C” on a military matter:- —
“Acting-Private,” who whoops (B. 20/7/’ll) for
all Australian infantry to be drilled as mounted in-
fantry, plainly isn’t an acting staff-officer. He says that
some day “the change will be indispensable,” and
seems to imagine that in war the whole Australian
army will gallop madly forward on horseback. If it
does, it will starve. “Acting-Private” wants an army
mounted on Cup winners, so that it may be “mo-
bile.” But no army is more mobile than its tucker.
It marches on its stomach. And no army that ever
existed could tackle such a problem in transport as
“Acting-Private” forgets. South Africa showed that,
whereas 500 infantry-men could be fed on 20001 b.
weight per day, 500 mounted men would need
70001 b. a day— 3s times as much. Kitchener (call
him Bloody if you like) knew something about
moving troops over big distances; it was his job in
Egypt, India and Africa. Leaving out artillery, he re-
commended organising Australia’s army thus —84,000
infantry, 13,000 mounted infantry. Transport and
feeding will be a frightful trouble, anyhow; but, on
“Acting-Private’s” lines, it , would be a cataelysmal
smash. Fully half of his army would be engaged
in protecting and convoying tucker for the other
half; and where would the fighting strength be ?
I leave out the question whether the horses could be
obtained. Without that consideration, it’s a good
thing “Acting-Private” isn’t Acting-Commander-in-
Chief.
Dr. Jones, inspector of Victorian inebriate
institutions, says in his yearly report that
the female sex is becoming more and more
addicted to liquor. This seems the more
alarming in view of the opinion of Dr. Jones
that “the inheritance of any neurosis is more
potent for ill if transmitted through the
female line.” The doctor vigorously assaults
the national hobby of shouting, and the “per-
nicious habit which has arisen of concluding
business with a drink.” It is not very obvi-
ous how the “female line” is affected in this
way, but the report has furnished texts for
all the Wowsers of Australia. And in all
the sermons they preach they will be quite
sure to miss the fact that if women do drink
more now it is because there is more drink-
ing in the homes; and if he wants to have
still more of that, all the Wowser has to do
is to succeed in shutting up the pubs.
“Yarrum,” on the mak-
ing of “first families” :
When I was a boy I knew,
in the back country of N. S.
Wales, an Englishman named
Brock, and I thought he was
the funniest thing in men I’d
ever known. Brock, although
he had brains, could neither
read nor write; and his gib-
berish was scarcely under-
standable. Up to that time
I was under the impression
that England was a highly-
civilised country, and I
couldn’t make out how Brock’s
education had been over-
looked. And how such a man
ever got back into the wilds
of Australia puzzled me, un-
til, after he’d learned a bit
of the language, he told the
tale. It seems that, when he
and the wife landed in Syd-
ney first, a squatter engaged
the pair at £25 per year
and their keep. They were
taken to Campbelltown, and
were afterwards bullock-
dray ed 400 miles up country,
and dumped down among the
kangaroos in the heart of the
bush. After that, and long
before I knew Brock, he dum-
mied some country for his
employer and stuck to it
like a man! I took an in-
terest in Brock, because he
often lent me his gun and a
horse, and I taught him to
read a bit and write his name
—he never got beyond the
name. Late in life he became
a J.P. ; and, for what I’d
done for him he gave me a
horse, saddle and bridle, and
wanted to adopt me. Some-
times now I’m rather sorry
that he didn’t, as I, too,
might have been a Jay Pay,
and have had a few sheep-
farms of my own. I was re-
minded of Brock only the
other week by meeting a man
in Sydney who reckoned he
had known him well. The
man assured me that Brock
had “come of a good family”
—in fact, I’m told Potts, or
some other Point, has now-
adays a family-tree to prove
it.
“Shellback” : Commander Brewis, the Com-
monwealth’s new lighthouse expert, has re-
commended the Government to try
“unattended” lighthouses on two islands in
Bass Straits. These lights are cheap to
erect, and are so ingeniously constructed
that they work continuously without any at-
tention for months at a time. Not only
would their erection save the annual cost of
two or three keepers, but it would reprieve
GREAT EXPECTATIONS.

A severe attack of religious mania which
lately afflicted a North Melbourne damsel
has disclosed the existence of a quaint body
which calls itself the Pentecostal Mission,
and exists chiefly by casting out devils. It
boasts a nominal head called Brother Jef-
frey, “a mild, thin, whiskered, blue-
eyed idealist” ; an assistant, known as Sister
Sloane, ascetic-looking and middle-aged ; and
an energetic factotum known as Sister'
Lancaster, a brief, bustling woman, with a
keen eye in her head and “Praise the Lord”
on her hat. Apparently there are quite a
number of persons in Melbourne in similar
case to the Gadarene swine, and the Mission
does a tidy business on the “voluntary offer-
ing” plan. Also, the parties run a home
for fallen women and one for derelict men,
though as they can cast out devils, the neces-
sity for these “homes” is not obvious. Pos-
sibly the devils in these cases are extra
tough, and call for a bit of extra attention at
the penitential washtub and woodlieap. One
of the Mission’s “patients” is a cripple with
one leg much shorter than the other. The
missionaries say they have already, by plen-
tiful prayer, stretched it 4in., but as it
won’t go any further, they reckon the
patient’s faith has run out. Still, 4in. is not
to be sneezed at. 'Cake it all round, there
are points about this casting-out-devils in-
dustry, and if the Mission would get to work
on John Weary’s imp of laziness, there would
be a fine chance of a test case.

What the Tory press called a case of
“extortion by a union” happened the other
day in Adelaide, when a newly-arrived non-
union felt-hatter was asked to pay an en-
trance fee of 20 guineas on joining the local
union. It does look a sizeable fee; but it
isn’t at all shocking when it is remembered
(1) that the member may pay it by instal-
ments, and (2) that it isn’t so much an en-
trance fee as a contribution to a guarantee
fund. The employer who says he believes
in “the old unionism” is fond of snorting at
the unions of skilled tradesmen for taking
any sort into membership, so that, though he
is compelled to employ unionists, he gets no
guarantee that they are competent men.
The hatters’ union says: “Very well. We’ll
do what you want. In fact, we’ll do more —
we’ll guarantee you against loss if one of
our members should prove incompetent and
spoil your material.” Obviously, they can’t
give the guarantee without having a fund
to do it with ; yet, instead of getting three
cheers from the employer and liis press bar-
rackers when they establish that fund, they
get the charge of “extortion” thrown at
them. Somehow these people omit to aim
the same clod at the Stock Exchange when
it charges £5OO or so for membership of the
stockbrokers’ union, and even then doesn’t
guarantee a member’s clients against loss
through incompetence or plain roguery.
“Phil Harum’s” revised versions:—
It’s a wise ratepayer that knows his own aider-
man.
A little lying is a dangerous thing.
He who laughs last sometimes laughs too late.
The good die young ; but it is not easy to discover
their burial places.

When beauty draws me with a s'ngle hair,
One of the golden mop she loves to wear,
My shaken soul is full of pleasant care
My lips can never utter:
I love the tresses of my dimpled fair,
But not within the butter.
I want my lady for her own sweet sake;
I long to kiss her morning eyes awake.
And all her beauty in my arms to take
When no one else is looking;
But Heaven forbid that she should want to mate
Me happy with her cooking!
I want her presence near me all the day
To chase with smiles my blackest moods away,
That I may laugh when fortune starts to play
Her troublesome old capers;
But wrath will smite our home if she essay
To tidy up my papers.

ALITIES
“Bilbax”: I can’t agree with “Pick” that
the lyre-birds’ dancing-floor is an artificial
grub-farm, and the birds’ dancing merely
their method of worm cultivation. The grubs
and worms are there sure enough, but merely
incidentally. The lyre-bird is not singular in
this amusement. The bower-bird lays out an ornate
ball-room, and uses it every fine day; the native com-
panions hold quadrille assemblies on the great Vic-
torian plains, to the wonderment often of an en-
circling flock of sheep; the emu, ungainly enough at
other times, can play the dancing dude and light-
toed lady admirably; the curlews assemble every
moonlight night (and, often in day-time, too) for a
dance, the liveliness of which is in queer contrast to
the uncanny musical accompaniment. Like the lyre-
bird, the curlew has its regular dancing ground, but
it is merely a clear, level place, and 1 do not know
that it prepares or tends it in any way. And any out-
back wild-duck shooter can tell of the quaint antics
with which the water-fowl amuse themselves.
“Silas Snell” : The reported incident of a
Westralian kangaroo possessing himself of a pass-
ing motor-car, and running it on his own, recalls
several personal experiences illustrative of ’roo’s
proneness to insinuate himself into strange places.
Charley Voo was working the shallow alluvial at
Pinafore. One morning he went below, spiked his
candle, and was getting down to biz, when, biff! a
huge body out of the shadows landed on his neck,
and then went bounding and jumping about in the
gloaming like a demented camel. Voo was twice
bowled over before lie got on to the rope, and he
went up to daylight firmly convinced his claim
was possessed of devils. A search party discovered
a demoralised ’roo in the workings. When coal
mining beyond Morwell, I met Wetter. He was out
for pelts, and had built himself a neat hut in the
gorge above the ague line. He invited us all to
dinner one Sunday. We went early. There were
two ducks and a slab of pork sizzling , in the camp-
oven ; a boiler of cabbage, a pot of potatoes and a
pudding were all going in the spacious fireplace.
Suddenly something whacked into the middle of the
meal, hurling scalding victuals all over the hut. I
sat up, with a potato in my ear, just in time to
see the tail-end of a parboiled kangaroo shoot
through Wetter’s calico sidelight. ’Roo had taken a
flying leap . into the hut chimney, and demoralised
our banquet. While we were burying Ivauff (the
only wandering Jew I ever knew) in the new ceme-
tery at Eight Hours, the dogs started a bunch of
kanga’ in the adjacent scrub, and the lot whooped
down on us. The daddy of the party went, head
over tip, into Kauff’s grave, on to Kauff’s coffin, and
wedged there on his back. When the mourners reas-
sembled for prayers, there was ’roo in an awful
hole, spiteful, and ravenous for battle. We en-
deavored to remove him, but he reached for us with
his great toe, so we buried him with Kauff.
“Nomad”: “Leo Lear” has evidently in-
sufficiently observed the habits of the black cocka-
too, which, as far as my observations go, is the best
meteorologist in the bush. I am living some 15
miles from the coast (W.A.), and whenever I see
the blackies flying inland I can safely bet on wet
and squally weather. Similarly, when they return,
I can just as surely depend upon a spell of fine
weather. I have noticed this for many years, not
only in this State, but in others, and as far as birds
are concerned, 1 shall pin my faith to Black Cocka-
too when I want a weather prophet. He is even
more reliable than “rna’s corns,” and, as the
daughters of a one-time professional weather fore-
caster alleged, raa’s corns are 86 per cent, better
than pa’s predictions.
* * * *
“Pick”: I want to be in the early rush
to jump on “Jimmie Crow” for his selection (B.
13/7/’ll) of the native cat as a friendly bush animal.
On the "Monaro Plains (N.S.W.) before the rabbit and
fox and other Cold Country importations got in their
fine work, the cat was the pet curse of the blue-nose
settlers. It would then, as now, attack, cling to,
and suck the blood from birds or young animals
many times its weight; it is a nightly robber of the
hen roost, and has been known to mob, and eat alive,
weak sheep, litters of young pigs, or a .cow fast in a
bog. Also, it will gnaw clothing, saddles, harness,
green hide and sheep skins, and a single contact with
its filthy presence will render unfit for use flour,
sugar, beef, or anything else in the tucker box. It
hasn’t even the redeeming virtue of being a valuable
fur-bearer, for, although admittedly pretty, its skin
is too greasy for curing, and its smell is abomina-
tion doubly distilled. When the Monaro P.P.
Boards issued a proclamation that the cat was to be
protected as a rabbit destroyer, the settlers swore a
dreadful oath to resist the decree with their last
whisker. They then got to the enemy so busily
that the cat, in those regions, has practically been
wiped off. Which meets with my entire approval.
“Condamine”: While the fox has a good
repertoire of stock dodges, his cunning is altogether
over-rated. And once you learn the dodges you win
every time. For instance, if a fox is disturbed near
a hill-top he will almost invariably circle round to
place himself behind the hunter. Experts at the
game, noting the direction he is bearing, cut off at
an angle, and generally meet England’s ideal tacti-
cian ambling along with a quiet smile on his dial
in fancied security. Perhaps the animal thinks that
as he has only beastly colonials to deal with, he has
no need to be careful; more likely, generations of
experience gave him this estimate of the English
hunter, and he falls in accordingly.
DERIVATIONS.
“I wonder why they call him Buttons?"
“ Guess it's because he's always off when you
want him most.”
“Can-Teen”: Why does the dog roll in
any perfumed article he comes across? (B. 27/7/T1).
For much the same reason that Wee McGregor eats
cloves. The primeval dog in his forest found it pru-
dent to mask his natural dogginess, as far as pos-
sible, from his enemies as well as from his prey,
and so contracted the habit of identifying himself
with any foreign odor he came across. ( He may
have liked it, ■ too, for the difference in odors seems
much a question of taste. F’r instance, have any
Abos. noted the similarity in odor between a wattle
and a beast dead in the bush? Personally, I find
them much alike, and, with a little stretch of the
imagination, both are allied to the scent of the rose.
The true attar always seems to me so overpowering
as to nearly approximate to that vulgar word used
by McG. in his par—a stink!
RECOVERING.
OLD L ADY: “ Why , you're the man that I gave a large piece of cake to last week!"
SAD SAM: “Yes, mum, I'm able to get about agen."
“Cellu Loid”: “Stickpicker” can be as-
sured that the blue-mouthed pine-adder has a ven-
omous end. We call the brute “gecko” out in the Ban-
galow (N.S.W.) country, and, although he doesn’t go
looking for trouble, he’ll see that there is plenty
available if the circumstances impress him that way.
On those occasions he bites with the mouth and de-
posits in the wound a colorless slime. This slime
oozes out of the ridge down the top of the back and
tail. It is a poison right enough, but so slow of
action that a good washing in very hot water and
powerful antiseptic within half an hour of the bite
will kill it. Let it get well started, however, and it is
as stubborn as it is slow. The wound is not very
painful at first, but the poison takes hold and gets
right to the bone, and causes a dirty black-looking
sore with a most offensive smell, and a huge ambition
to spread. Have never seen a man go right out to
it; but have known cattle that literaUy fell to pieces
from the effects of the gecko bite. Before the tail
juice can take effect, however, there must be a
scratch or wound of some sort. Neither will the
bite itself do any harm if the adder forgets to cock
the tail in the right direction. The trouble is he
always seems to remember.
* * * *
“Chloe”: The aborigines of the Kimber-
leys (W.A.) have some curious marital customs, but
none more so than the wholesale exchange of wives,
which happens about every three years. The tribes
gather at appointed rendezvous, make much corrob-
oree for a day or two, and then prepare for the lubra-
swapping rite. On a given signal every woman rushes
from the camp, screaming as if pursued by a herd
of devils. The men then arrange themselves into
groups, mark out a cabalistic geometrical standing-
ground, and go through extravagant posturings and
dances to the accompaniment of the boom of the
“roarer.” When the ceremonial has been brought
to an end, the women are summoned back to camp,
and, arranging themselves in groups according to
tribe, pass under review of their lords and masters.
Much chattering and argument goes on among the
men, but the women must keep silence until their
future proprietors have been decided on. The ex-
change appears to be optional. The women are
mostly quiescent, except that now and then a young
bride resents losing a satisfactory man, or dis-
likes the idea of separation from their offspring, for
the children remain always with the tribe of the
father. Protest, however, on the part of the refrac-
tory gin is futile.
“Off-Sider”: It’s plain that “Leo Lear”
(B. 11/5/’ll) has never been in North Queensland, or
he would have a better opinion of bullocks and bul-
lock-punchers generally. There are some 20 teams work-
ing round about Cairns, with from 22 to 28 bullocks
in each, but I have never seen Jerseys or Ayrshires
in any of them. One family of teamsters on the
Cairns-Herberton line claim to be the champion lan-
guage and whip manipulators in the North, and when
they are operating in earnest you can smell singed
bullock for miles. And these bullocks expect it as an
hereditary right.
“Yowi”: Struck a station up nor’-west
lately. Listen. A Chow gardener, a negro cook, a
half-caste butcher. Visiting the station at the time,
and patronised largely by all hands, were two
Afghan camel pedlars. Most of the work on the run
is done by aboriginal “boys,” whose gins act as
laundresses to the establishment. The monthly mail
setyioe is termed the “black mail,” because it is
run by a blackfellow. Have you got a spare Jap or
two you could send along? No objection to a Red
Indian or Kanaka.
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
FIRST LATE-C OMER: "Who's the woman?”
SECOND DITTO: “I doand t know, mine
friendt; but , by the vay she's going on , I
should say she vas his vife.”
“Condot” : Concerning the commandeering
of the wattle by S’Africa as a national flower (B.
27/7/’ll), it is true that a number of wattles have
a home in the land of the Boer. But it is also true
that the best of them —I believe the only beautiful
species—were introduced by Australians from Aus-
tralia. Friends of mine wrote to me some years ago:
“For God’s sake send over a few wattle trees to remind
us of Australia, and to brag about.” I sent them,
and they grew handsomely. The Cootamundra wattle
is one of the prettiest cultivated trees in S’Afriea.
On the other hand, we are indebted to that country
for 27 different weeds which are either nox : ous or
merely useless, including the apple of Sodom, the
African box thorn, the Cape weed, and the Cape
tulip. I don’t think we have played such a sorry
trick on S’Africa as to send a single weed over there
—since the war, anyway.
NE TEMERE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sun was warm, the blue,
I waited for the Manly boat;
The flannel flowers were waiting- too
For me, because they knew I wrote,
And in a paper bought by me
I read of old “Ne Temere.”
It all was such a waste of space
(Though that’s the rule in ev’ry daily,
Just as most Bishops have no grace
And as most sextons dig graves gaily) ;
For I had known a man, you see,
And here’s the tale he told to me:
“I met Her at a party first—
Her hair is black, her eyes are grey—
And after that I felt a-thirst,
Thirsty to see her every day ;
At last I took her for a walk,
Ending in very little talk.
“I could not speak—l loved her so,
And she was tongue-tied, just like me;
But earth seemed like a heaven below,
If she and I alone could be;
I told her Love was Sun and Spring,
And she said ‘Yes’ to everything.
“ ’Twas relatives that made the row,
For while we loved we didn’t care
For all the creeds that may be now,
Or after Her, or anywhere;
Said they to her, ‘Beware the ban !
That nasty bloke’s an Orangeman.’
“I was an Orangeman, because
My father’s father’s Orange too.
Sons don’t pick out the faults and flaws
In dad’s beliefs, or shouldn’t do;
But my dad rose my dander quick,
Says he, ‘Your girl’s a Cartherlick ! ’
“She, worrying over bell and book!
Me, talking rot about the Lodge!
Oh! all the trouble that we took
Nature to baulk and Love to dodge!
But when your heart is singing ‘Love,’
You’ve not much time for Heaven above.
“You’ve not much time for Heaven above,
For clean Love brings it to you here.
When in the Lodge I’d think of Love,
While ‘brothers’ bleated ancient fear —
Shy brothers with their ‘Er’ and ‘Hem!’
And bleat of the P.W.G.M.
“My collar came to be the sign
Of Bright’s disease and sea-sick bile;
I felt all known diseases mine,
I felt I’d like to learn to smiie;
And ever, over all my woes,
The G.M.’s blessed bleat arose.
“The business and the service done,
The squalling ‘harmony’ at end,
Old castes and orders new begun
(For all were ‘brothers’ —none a friend !)
Some ‘brothers’ took the penny car—
Three to a brilliant private bar.
“So for my sorrows drink by drink
I took and drowned the blessed lot,
Trying to laugh and not to think
And make a world of whisky hot ;
Then that ridiculous G.M.
Must say,; ‘l’m glad you’re quit of them!’
“I saw Her pleading eyes of grey !
I saw Her dear and drooping head!
Love leaped the poles of them that pray—
I knew without Her life was dead.
Love leaped the poles of dogma then,
As it must be with gentlemen.
“I saw his foolish face—a moon—
A flattened orange moon of fat!
He thought escape from Her a boon !
I hit him hard and smashed his hat!
Squashed pumpkins on a broken stem
Remind me now of that G.M.
“And so next day I called on Iler
And said, ‘I am your master. None — '
Unless I’m very like a cur—
Shall come ’twixt us beneath the sun!
The force which governs you and I,
Began ere Eve began to die!
“If savages of one sort killed
The savages of Derry, then
My heart is with displeasure filled,
I’m sure they weren’t gentlemen.
But naught is aught but you and I!
So love me till it’s time to die.
“And then? All right, and right is all!
The baby holds the service now!
He is both Lodge and Cardinal!
He is the Pope to whom we bow.
And in this newest Church and State
I put the money, in the plate!”
VICTORIA.

J. W. COCKBAINE, Proprietor-
“Cello Loid” on the moral code: —
A word in “Arcarlo’s” pink ear. My knowledge
of the Solomons goes away back to the days when
men picked up their hat and gun as a matter of
course. I was at Atta when Jimmy Arthur was
shot. I sailed in the Lochiel, Valador, Sydney
Belle and many others, and know the Mala (or
Malaita) man inside and out. The kamer law is all I
said it was. I could cite plenty of cases. Remember a
trader trying to recruit a “boy” who was willing to
go if the /carocr-forbidden girl he wanted would ac-
company him. The trader, to whom the boy was
worth £ 30, offered the old men money, trade, por-
poise teeth, and finally a Winchester rifle. But they
stood firm against breaking the law of blood re-
lationship. Afterwards the girl was exchanged to
another tribe. Price, nil. Take the punishment
side. A recruiting vessel from Bundaberg called at
Atta Cove; the natives flocked aboard, and
“something happened” there to one of the girls.
That night, ashore, the Law stalked, and her dead
body was on the beach in the morning. At the same
time two cartridges were handed a young native for
the benefit of the white man on the schooner. But
skippers got to know he was wanted, and would not
carry him ; and it was 10 years before he sailed
that way again. When he was 20 miles from Atta,
word of his coming was sent up the coast, and the
day after his arrival he was shot dead. The car-
tridges were not the original ones, but it didn’t make
any perceptible difference.
“Fag'in”: “Stickpicker” (B. 6/7/T1) in-
quires if the pine-adder is venomous. Why, cer-
tainly ; it is lethal. A couple of years ago, at Bin-
gara (N.S.W.), the little daughter of a local resi-
dent was bitten on the hand by one of the blue-
mouthed species, and died after a few hours of
screeching agony.
THE COWSUAL
AUSTRALIAN.
COCKY : “Hallo! Where the
deuce are you off to?”
S ARAH: “Well — er—the fact is, father, I'm — er— going away to get married."
C OCKY: “ Orright; shut the gate after you, and don't let that dashed cow out."
“Barcoo”: “Polecat Pete,” of Tasmania,
asks (B. 13/7/’ll) whether the diorite-puncher on
this bigger island uses the slang phrase, “Snatch it”
when he talks about sending in his resignation.
“Poly Peter” must be one of Denham’s escaped new-
chum immigrants if he hasn’t heard the term. I
have myself been “snatching it,” “grabbing it,”
“dragging it,” “pulling it,” and occasionally “get-
ting the push” for the last 15 years on Australian
gold fields.
“Leo Lear” : I don’t place much cash on
“Jeroi’s” dodge of tar-soaking maize to stop the
depredations of rats (B. 29/6/’ll). It works while
green feed is abundant, but not when the rodents
become hunger-pinched. Poisoned maize in the fur-
rows is the surest antidote in a maize crop. Ditto
spuds for a potato field, and so on. Incidentally,
has anybody ever considered the battle for existence
that maize has to put up? Weevils burrow into its
appendix before it is sown ; and immediately it
sprouts ’possums, curlew and bandicoots (which in-
clude ’roo rats and other rats) scratch out the soft,
germinated seed. Then wallaby descend on the crop
and chew it hip and thigh ; after which the surviv-
ing stalks may be expected— plus rain and minus
stray cows —to reach the cob-forming stage. Where-
upon miles of crows split open the husk and feast
on the innards, while grubs bore tunnels with
mathematical precision to its nerve-centre. As the
grain hardens, parrots and cockatoos take their turn
at the helm, and, if not relieved, wreck the whole
show. Then the weevils come again for the ripe
crop, and the devastating cycle is round at the
starting-gate.
“Quidam”: What a lot of trouble was
laid up for this world by the ass who invented the
shovel! When one thinks of the large section of
mankind that_ gets itself tired and stiff and gener-
ally impaired shifting dirt from one place to an-
other with the accursed instrument, and reflects that
if it had never been invented mankind would not
have had anything like so many holes, shafts, cut-
tings and so on to fall into, and might have found
out ways of enjoying itself on the surface of the
globe without laboriously and most unenjoyably dig-
ging artificial depressions in it, one can only arrive
at the conclusion that the person who first devised
the shovel should have been battered to death with
the handle. Mining, for instance, may be accurately
described as shifting dirt from one place to another,
and in most cases getting mighty little for it; and if
there were no shovels for shifting it, the dirt might
be left in its original place, and as for every good
mine that pays for the dirt it requires to be moved,
about 100 do nothing but make calls, the world, I
contend, would really be better off, and would in
time learn to get along without mines. Anyway,
from the point of view of a person who has occas-
ionally used a shovel, and does not intend to do it
again till he has to, I hold that the shovel is a dis-
turber of the peace, and should be obliterated. But
the more we advance in our civilisation the more
we seem to stick to it.
“Wonga” : The starlings, which have been
vigorously cursed by the fruitgrower for some time,
are getting credit from the stations in different parts
of the Ma State for wiping out the blowfly—a pest
that has been playing Aged Harry in the sheep coun-
try, and threatened to be one of the worst
troubles that sheepmen have had to fight. It is cer-
tain that, where the starlings are thick, the jum-
bucks are kept remarkably free; and if they are
going to keep the fly down, they are good for some-
thing like a million pounds sterling to the Ma State
alone. Which is worth a feed of fruit now and
again.
“Snooker” : I do not agree that the adder
stingeth with the south end of his spine. That part
of his anatomy is used simply as an aid to locomo-
tion. Speaking in general, the adder possesses
habits peculiarly his own. He loves dust, and on
summer nights will play for hours in the middle
of a floury road. Unlike the snake, he never at-
tacks ; anything may be placed quite close to his
elbow, and he will not interfere with it; but lef
somebody push him, and he strikes with a rapidity
that defies detection. The color of the death-adder
corresponds with the color of the soil in his locality,
or perhaps the soil corresponds with him. I’m not
sure. Anyhow, it makes his presence difficult to de-
tect. Up here (Hastings River, N.S.W.) he is of a
red tinge, and a length ranging from 18in. to 24in.
On the Liverpool Plains (N.S.W.) the fashion in
overcoats is brown, and in many cases the wearers
measure up to 3ft.
IN THE SAME BOAT.
MISS COCKY: “Hi! Your dogs worry in’ our cat."
ME. SWAGGIE: “He ain't my dorg."
MISS C.: “Why, he followed you down the road!"
MR. S.: “Well, mum, if it comes to that, you weren't AHEAD of me!"
“P. Jeff. Wallace”: Turning out some old
luggage that had not seen daylight for many years, I
came across the following lay of the bushranging
days, which I took from one “Paddy the Poet” at a
roadside pub in Doughboy Hollow, while travelling
from Tanworth to Newcastle. It is quite genuine,
and, to a “choon” bearing a mongrel resemblance to
“The Groves of Blarney,” jumped, bumped and
somersaulted thuswise: —
Och, for to be taken an’ hung like bacon,
Av Oi’m not mishtaken is an awful job,
Just like bould Paisley, which I think was bastely,
Or poor young Manns who ne’er a sowl did rob.
Sure Oi think Cockytoo, sir, would very well do, sir,
For all the deeds of our highway knights—
They’re no worse than our Mimbers, those divil’s
imbers
Who rob the people av all their rights.
Sure, they braved all dangers, those bould bushrangers,
An’ many’s the thrap did they double up;
An’ for days an’ nights, sure, thim hardy wights, sure,
Padrolled the bush widout bite or sup.
But our brave Bin Hall, sir, eclipsed thim all, sir,
And in his last moments his flag unfurled ;
And only for the ’possum that jumped across him
The traps wouldn’t ha’ cotched him in this blessed
world.
Sure, tin shots they fired, sir, before they got tired,
sir,
And the last one hit Ben all in the head,
Saying, as he expired, “Boys, I’m glad yez fired, boys,
For I’d never be taken anny other way than dead.”
To conclude and finish, my song Oi’ll diminish,
Wid a health to Dunn and brave Thunderbowlt,
Who is an ould.stager, Oi’ll lay a wager,
Though young Dunn, they tell me, is only a coult.
May they get away, sir, from Bot’ny Bay, sir,
To some furrin shore all beyant the says,
Where’ll they’ll live on bacon, an’ not be quakin’,
But die quite paeeful an’ all at aise.
* * * *
“Saladin” : It grieves me to notice, amid
all the talk of shearing tallies, and the newspaper
glorifications of Zimmerle, Cooper, Maurer, Searey
and Livingstone, that there is no mention made of
“Crooked Mick” from the Speewah country. When
I first lobbed on to the “far Barcoo,” more years
ago than I care to remember, the name and fame of
Mick filled the land to overflowing. His name was
the absolute last word in shearing tallies and
most other things. If any snagger boasted of hav-
ing shorn 32 sheep in the breakfast “run,” there
was always someone present to mention that “Crook-
ed Mick,” at Speewah, had done 33 in the same
time. If “Whistling Dick” spruiked of having lived
five days without water, the glory of his perform-
ance was immediately eclipsed by the recital of
“Crooked Mick’s” long abstinence of 64 days. When
old “Saddle Strap” told of having walked 98 miles
in a day, there was a deep silence until the records
(of memory) were searched, and the Crooked one’s
celebrated 99-miles tally was produced, and that
ended the dispute. I travelled far; I was at Alice
Downs when Howe’s big tally was done. I also knew
my way about the “Dry” Alice too; but I never got
a chance to thank the Speewah man for all the argu-
ment and blankv he had stopped.
“Eddyson” : We were 11 boarders witli
Mrs. Tom Daniels. It was understood that Thomas
had gone West to better his fortunes, and hail
missed next to everything, with the result that his
missus took in boarders in self-defence. We were
very comfortable at the house of Daniels, Compt as
star boarder at the head of the table, the rest in
two rows of five down each side in the order of our
merit. Then Thomas Daniels came home. The West
had licked him hollow, and he looked it. He was
a tired and depressed man, whom victuals had often
passed coldly by on the outside, I fancy. Mrs.
Daniels did seem to be indulging in any trans-
ports of wifely v joy. She put Daniels in the chair
at the bottom of the table, gave him a small, luke-
warm helping when the rest were served, and neg-
lected to ask a blessing. Daniels said nothing. A
most reticent man was Daniels. He picked up much
in three days, and got a billet on the fourth. Two
evenings later he worked up an unspoken grievance
against Thorn, next on his right at table, and in a
battle in the hall smote Thorn so grievously that
Thorn retired hurt, and never returned. Daniels
took his place at table. Daniels had turned the cor-
ner, so to speak. Within 48 hours Carlton, who sat
next on the right of Thomas, neglected to pass the
mustard in what Thomas considered a pointed way.
When Thomas had finished, Carlton did not care to
resume the meal. Daniels took his chair. The next
person to awaken the resentment of Thomas was
Mclntyre. Mac made a better fight all down the
passage, through the kitchen, and twice round the
yard. Then his chin got in the way, and Daniels
took his chair. By this time we were all much con-
cerned about the new pilgrim’s progress. At the
very next dinner Bland was outed in 28secs. Daniels
took his chair, on the left of Compt. the star-
boarder, who sat at the head of the table. It was
with heightened interest that I went in to the next
dinner. There was no fight. The chair at the head
of the table was vacant. The star boarder had in-
stalled himself in the unowned chair at the foot.
Compt was a man who could take a hint. lam
still grateful to the Providence that inspired Daniels
to travel up the right-hand side.
“Hassan”: “Smell” (B. 20/7/T1) re-
vives an ancient myth when he asks whether tne
death-adder (to be exact, Acanthopis antarcticus )
stings with the bony process on the tip of the tail.
The death-adder does not sting at all, but bites, like
every other venomous snake, with its two pcison
fangs. “Perfume” is also not quite correct in stat-
ing that death-adders live only in rocky country. I have
killed them in the Sydney Centennial Park scrub,
where there isn’t enough rock to cover a sweater s
soul. I believe that “Odor’s” third statement is correct.
I am told on good authority these corpulent reptiles
jump by suddenly straightening the back, though 1
have never seen them do it. But isn’t seven yards
a little over the odds? Talking of death-adders, the
“Harmsworth Natural History” declares that the
black snake ( Prendechys ■ porphyriacus ) is called
the “purple death-adder” in Australia.. It further
states that the tiger snake ( Hoplocephalus curtus
or Brachyaspis—there seems some new generic nom-
enclature amongst Australian snakes) is known as
the “short death-adder.” Has anybody ever heard
these names thus applied? I haven’t. But this may
be one of those things which one must go out ot
one’s own country to learn.
THE EMPTY PIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Church is awakening to the fact that it has
been too rash in committing Christians to the
flames. The pastor of a prominent Melbourne sub-
urban Anglican church, on a recent Sunday, gave
serious consideration to the over-crowded state of
Hell.
I saw the Devil in his den,
And pressed him for an interview;
The damned were not o’erflowing then.
I saw no swarming, tortured crew.
No smallest need to pack and squeeze,
And Nick himself sat at his ease,
With nothing in the world to do.
“Why, bless you no!” he said. “There’s space
For billions more ’twixt wall and wall.
In fact, those worldly ones whose case
Is judged by parsons low and tall,
And who with fine prophetic ire
Are damned to everlasting fire,
But rarely come my way at all.
“It’s quite another kind of soul
That comes to linger in my joint—
Good churchmen are thejq on the whole,
And often such as you anoint.
All puny souls. So small are they
With ease a million million may
Be trussed upon a needle’s point.”

There is a prevailing opinion that it is dangerous
to stop diarrhoea too suddenly. That may be the case
when an astringent medicine is used, but there is
not the least danger of stopping it too quickly when
Chamberlain’s Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy
is taken, as it is not an astringent, and stops the
diarrhoea by curing the disease that caused it. As
a rule, only two or three doses are required, but in
very severe cases a whole bottle is sometimes
needed,*
PERSONAL
ITEMS
Miss Fanny Cohen, 8.A., B.Sc., is the
first woman graduate to obtain a travelling
scholarship from the Sydney ’Varsity. She
left for Europe on Saturday, and will, ac-
cording to present arrangements, shine next
at Cambridge. A list of the lady’s academic
scalps is as long as J. Bullstein’s face
when he hears that the lire policy has run
out before the fire happened. She has taken
first-class honors and a scholarship in mathe-
matics, a prize and honors in botany and bio-
logy, a University medal and Professor
David’s prize for geology, and, in her last
dash, the John Coutts graduate and the
Barker travelling scholarship. And if the
Uni. offered a prize for the best-looker, she
wouldn’t be half a block behind.
THE JOKE PUT UP ON BILL.
M ICKO: “ But the funniest thing of the lot
was Bill. There he stood at the top of the
burnin' building, and us blokes yelled out,
'Jump, Bill, an' we'll catch yer in the
tarpaulin.' So Bill jumped — an' we ’adn't
got no tarpaulin!”
Speaker Coles (S.A.), who has been danger-
ously ill, is recovering, and it is expected he
will be able to take the chair again at the
end of his present leave. For some time it
was thought that he would never get back to
Parliament again. Until this illness he had
not been absent from a sitting of the
Assembly for 21 years.
Sample of the shocking piffle that even
reviews like the Fortnightly permit them-
selves when they get on to the demoralising
subject of Royalty :
Perhaps the most striking thing that can be said
of King George the Fifth is that he is the one man
in his own world-wide Empire who has seen it all.
As a solemn matter of fact, many an old
showman has forgotten more about the II em-
pire than Royal George ever saw in his
luxurious travels from port to port. A man
like R. S. Smythe, for instance —for about
40 years he was continuously going the
rounds of English-speaking countries in
charge of persons more distinguished than
the official Johnnies who dance attendance
on a prince.
Miss Brennan, lately called to the Vic-
torian Bar, studied medicine at first, but
“stage” fright attacked her, and she couldn’t
go on. So she tackled law, law being, as it
were, more in the family.
“Culex” : It was absurd to talk about H.
C. E. Childers being the real founder of Mel-
bourne University, as the English promoters
of that Childers memorial fund did (B.
(10/8/T1). Redmond Barry is the man.
Childers was only the Parliamentary mouth-
piece ; he didn’t personally care a dump for
it, and never took any interest in it—except
inasmuch as it promised some cheap glorifi-
cation of Huge Curly-’Eaded Childers, as he
was called.
‘‘Vic.”: Statues being on the board, I
insist that Flinders ought to have come first
in Melbourne. With no Flinders, there
would have been no Batman, Fawkner,
Higinbotham, Lalor or W. J. Clarke. Flin-
ders saved Victoria from being Terre Napo-
leon, and Hobson’s Bay from being Golfe
Josephine. The Crapauds kept him im-
prisoned for six years at Mauritius, to frus-
trate his discovery ; and still he was a suc-
cess. In passing, it is not generally known
that Hobson’s Bay, technically, is only the
bit between Williainstown and Port Mel-
bourne. The rest is Port Phillip Bay.
The first “uncle” in Melbourne happened
to be an aunt; Mrs. Anne Willis was the
first to obtain a. pawnbroker’s license in that
ctiy—on Nov. 12, 1,842. She commenced
business in a weatherboard bouse in Bourke-
street. Almost simultaneously, Samuel Whit-
taker, of Van Diemen’s Land, applied for and
obtained permission to hoist the three balls:
his olace of business was on the corner of
Little Collins and Queen streets, where Tem-
ple Court Hotel stands. It never rains but
it pours, so towards the end of the same
niontb J. B. Plevins got a license and opened
in Little Bourke-streot, in the rear of where
the Theatre Royal nowadays is.
J. F. Hogan recently picked up in a Lon-
don second-hand bookshop a Geelong (Vic.)
directory of 60 years ago. Among the ad-
vertisements was that of Henry Parkes,
“ivory and bone turner,” who announced for
sale “billiard and bagatelle balls, chessmen,
dice, dominoes, cups, balls, humming tops,
children’s rattles, thimbles, whistles, etc.”
This recalls that Henry Parkes visited Gee-
long in 1850, and established there a branch
of his Sydney business. A poem in praise
of Geelong, its scenery and its girls, is in-
cluded in Parkes’s first volume of verses;
the old man, with an eye to business, prob-
ably wrote it with his mobile tongue in his
cheek.
The cables made a Coronation baronet of
F. T. Bullen, the nautical lecturer who was
in these parts a while back, though he didn’t
look a bit like a person who would snare
that sort of “honor.” And he didn’t snare
it, either; Dr. Butlin,
president of the Royal
College of Surgeons,
was the man.
While Australian
pressmen were
wrongly deciphering
the telegram and load-
ing poor little Frank T.
Bullen with a baron-
etcy, the serious sea-
man was writing in
London to his friend
Edward Isaac, Bap-
tist reverend, in Mel-
bourne. And what
Bullen was telling his
friend was (among
other things) that he
had published 28 vol-
umes, and all the roy-
alty he was getting
out of the lot came to
about £2 a week.
From that he con-
cluded, somewhat ex-
cusably, that public
taste is for “the neur-
otic and tommyrotic.”
Giving all that in,
Bullen must, never-
theless. have played
his publishing cards
badly; for som* at least of his books have
had a large sale.

Memorial gates have just been put up at
Union College. Schnectady (U.S.A.), to
John Howard Payne, once a pupil of that
college, and author of “Home, Sweet Home.”
An orphan, left early without father or
mother, Payne never married, and never
had a home. Still, he managed to live a
good while without one—from 1792 to 1852
—-and then died at Tunis, where he was U.S.
Consul. His remains were removed cere-
moniously from Tunis to Washington, in
1000.
C. E. Glass, a pioneer of Victorian jour-
nalism, reached the end of the track a few
days ago. He arrived in Melbourne from
Canada in 1850, and went to the Forest
Creek diggings. After a bit of a rise in
gold, he established in 1857 Victoria’s first
penny newspaper, the Miner’s Right. His
successor in its ownership gave the paper the
stodgier title of Daily News. For a long
time in Melbourne he was a publisher, mix-
ing the trade with importing. He never
quite forsook the inky way, however, and uo
till very recently contributed to the press.
DANGERS OF THE AGE.
MISS OWL: “ Mother, what's the matter with
father?”
MRS. OWL: “Ok, poor dear, he was coming
home early this morning and one of those
beastly aeroplanes ran into him."
Callaway, principal Under Secretary, has
been appointed censor of gaol literature in
Victoria. He is going through a long cata-
logue in search of the works of Mrs. Hemans
and other writers whose products are calcu-
lated to bring a blush, to the cheek of W.
Sikes. One of the first books to be tabooed
was Oscar Wilde’s “Ballad of Reading Gaol,”
which hitherto, it seems, has been a favorite
at Pentridge.
Mrs. Emma Thorne, who died at Preston-
ville, Macleay-street, Sydney, last week, was
the last survivor of the three daughters of
Mr. Wm. Moliitt, one of the first printers in
Sydney—he was in business in King-street as
early a,s 1826, and some years later went
into Pitt-street, where Penfold’s now are.
Mr. Moffitt died in 1874, leaving property
valued at half a million. One of the sisters
of Mrs. Thorne was the widow of John
Marks, M.L.A.; she died and left a heap of
money behind her in 1908.
From New York:—
Professor Watson, of Adelaide University, and
his young friend Dr. O’Sallivan, astounded N’Yorkers
during the July heat-wave by “doing the town’’ in
a day, and thinking nothing of the grilling or the
hustling. They got up at 5 a.m., did the Zoo,
Riverside Drive, Central Park, Van Cortlandt Park,
the Singer Building, the Metropolitan Tower, the
Battery, a dozen big shops and several other points
of interest all before dinner, and they achieved a
Yankee meal in nine minutes. All this time the
mercury was so strenuous that ambulances were on
the jump and horses were falling dead in every
street. “You move a bit!” said an astonished
A Yorker. “Oh, no,” said Watson; “we’re just
dawdling round on a holiday.”
Retired from N.S.W. Public Service, after
ftO years pursuit of the elusive Government
pay-voucher, Victor Cohen, late accountant
in the Lands Department. Cohen was one
of the best-known of public servants, chiefly
because he took up cricket. He was mana-
ger of the ’93 (Blackham’s) Australian
Eleven which toured England. This team
was famous for several things, one of which
was Coningham, of the subsequent divorce
suit. When Victor was a very small young-
ster his father died, and his mother’s friends
got him a billet in the Treasury. Hence G.
H. Reid’s joke that Cohen was the “widow’s
mite cast into the Treasury.”
Interesting yarn from Peter Lalor’s eldest
grandson, J. P, Lalor, nowadays of Ival-
goorlie (W.A.) :■ —
A recent Bulletin par. mentioned a widely-cur-
rent statement that a Mr. John Wm. Bergan' who
died lately in Tasmania, was a son of Peter Lalor’s
sister. My grandfather had 17 brothers and one sis-
ter, so there were 19 in the family. The one sister
married E. parson named Paterson, at the
age of 1 1 , and died without children some few
months afterwards, so I’m afraid the Bergan claim
to kinship will have to be abandoned. Of my
grandfather s 17 brothers, six were killed fighting in
the Civil War in America; one was a Colonel in the
Austrian Army, and was killed at Sadowa in 1866 •
one was killed (a general officer) in the Car list ris-
ings; one, James Fenton Lalor, was mixed up in
48, and helped in the composition of Henry
George s book, “Progress and Poverty,” while in
prison at Dublin. Two were in the House of Com-
mons. The others died (some were killed) in
Europe. My grandfather was the only one to come
to Australia, and we have no other relations in Aus-
tralia. With regard to various claims of rela-
tionship, two rather amusing suggestions have been
thrown out: (1) That my grandfather’s name was
Lawler, but he changed it to Lalor to get away
from,the police, notwithstanding that, a week after
Eureka, he went to Creswick, and out of pure
bravado, bid in his own name for some property,
and also that he came from Queen’s County, Ire-
land, where no such name as Lawler is ever heard ;
(2) that we did the Bergan familv out of niv grand-
father’s property, when, as a matter of fact, the poor
old chap died without a cent.
( Just passed out, at 63, Donald
Campbell Urquhart, of Tasmania.
He started as a youth in the Bank
of Australasia, Ballarat, and fol-
lowed up the money-changing
game in Tasmania and Maori-
land. While in Seddon’s country
he studied law, was admitted, re-
turned to Tasmania, and became
Attorney-General in Braddon’s
Ministry in 1897, and Treasurer
in the Evans team in 1906; his
first portfolio came through A. I.
Clark s elevation to a Judgeship.
He was democratically inclined,
and was on the point of signing
the Labor party’s on more
than one occasion. But as he
had always been very popular
with his mining constituency of
Meehan, and had really repre-
sented the democratic miners very
well, he judged that there was no
need for him to sign on under the
modern Labor articles. His judg-
ment was wrong; the pledged La-
bor candidate annexed the seat,
and Urquhart never fully recov-
ered from his astonishment. He
subsequently sat for a farming
constituency awhile, but lost it in
1909, and had been quietly prac-
tising law and nursing a weak
heart ever since.
One of the best-known skippers
on the Australia-Maorilarid run,
Captain li. E. Smith, who for the
oast eight years has been on the
box seat of the Mokoia, has been
retired by the Union Co. He has
been arguing the point with Nep-
tune for 49 years, 27 of them as a
master, and has never been
worsted once. So it ends a dead-
heat, and the co. has done some-
thing extra-special to mark its
extra satisfaction.
From London :
Senator Stewart journeyed to London with the
Goronators, but he was not of them. He refused to
bestow even a side-glance on the regal mummeries,
but hurried away up north to his native Inverness
and Hieland hills. Stewart is a pure-blooded mem-
ber of the clan from which the Guelphs inherit their
fragment of divine right, and he regards them as
mere parvenus.
The Argus the other day “discovered” F.
T. Outtrim, who for 43 years has been
secretary of the Tullaroop (Vic.) shire
council, and brother of ex-Minister A. R.
Outtrim, the “daylight saving” enthusiast.
The old lady, with genial inaccuracy, tacked
10 years on to his already fairly lengthy
span, and made him 80 instead of 70. Never-
theless, Outtrim is something of a notable,
if only because he has absorbed the weighty
remarks of the average shire councillor, and
argued the point with the fierce contractor
for 40-odd years. It was he who told against
himself the old yarn of the dirty trick of
“George the Greek.” George was cracking
road metal by the yard, and Outtrim noticed:
that he was building his heap on the top of a
low, wide-spreading stump. The ancient
shire-boss said nothing, but quickly nicked a
bit out of a rail fence hard by, to keep track
of the sinful heap. When the metal was
stacked, he prepared for the denouement.
Seizing a shovel, he enthusiastically attacked
the heap opposite the marked rail. The
sweat stood on his white brow as he dug into
the splintered rock. He shifted nearly the
whole of it, and found nothing; then he gave
it best. The injured Greek was paid off, and
was far away when the truth dawned on the
engineer. George had spotted the mark on
the rail, dropped to its significance, and ex-
changed it for one opposite a “square” heap.
NO CLASS.,
The noise of the present N.S.W. State by-elections
far exceeds the importance of the issue at stake.—

FIRST FEDERAL P OLITICIAN: “ Goodness!
What’s all this kIbobbery abott?”
2ND D ITTO: "O, on’y some of the thripenny
bar fellows."
Tom Hood, who has been figuring in the
history of Collingwood (Vic.) for many
years, died in East Melbourne last week,
aged 85. The Government appointed Johnny
Fawkner, Tom Hood and Dick Norton as as-
sessors when it was desired to form a council
at Collingwood. After a referendum, Fawk-
ner, Hood and Norton conducted the first
election; and Dr. Murphy, first Speaker of
the Victorian Assembly, was the first chair-
man. Hood and Sam Ramsden, two years
later, joined the council, but Hood was in-
duced to resign in order to square up the
accounts. Thus he became rate collector,
and stuck to it for 30 years. When he was
70 he thought it was about time to strike out
for himself, so he went to Southern Cross
(W.A.), and became a councillor there.
A FALLEN TRAITOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Premier Jack Verran told the S.A. Assembly the
other evening that the chief factors in the defeat of
the recent Federal Referenda proposals were Ananias
and Judas Iscariot. Unfortunately the modern Judas
isn’t as sensitive as the old one, who went and
hanged himself.—The Bulletin.
Humbly through Tophet walks a weary soul
Who once had held his smoking whiskers high,
1 reading with honored steps the brimstone coal,
And heedless that the ways were somewhat dry.
All Hell esteemed him first upon its roll,
And gave him leadership in grill and fry.
Traitor, betrayer, liar, name on name
They piled his attributes of fiendish pride,
Veiling triumphant discords of his shame,
Wreathing with flowers of sulphur his swart hide,
And making large line-drawings in green flame
To indicate the way in which he died.
And thus in age-long splendor did he wait,
Nursing his reputation’s evil health,
Drinking his sixty-fold damnation straight,
And crowned a king of knavery and stealth,
Till word came Hellward from a certain State
Of Judas persons in the Commonwealth.
He heard, he trembled, and his horrent crown
He cast red-hot from off nis scorching head,
Smote the hot darkness with a dreadful frown
That turned his whisker-flames from blue to red ;
And while his roarings shook the baleful town,
“I want to change my blanky name,” he said.

This bank during the year issued 50,000 new shares
(£2 10s. paid, with a liability of £5) at a pre-
mium of £1 ss. This brought up the paid capital
to a level £500,000. With the appropriation now
made, the formal reserve fund is £480,000. Be-
sides the visible reserves the co. no doubt has some-
thing very solid up its sleeve. Thus, for
the past year it writes £lO,OOO off pre-
mises and £7500 off investments, and these
amounts, as well as a contribution to the officers’
pension fund ( £3000) and a bonus to staff
( £6000), have been deducted from the profits. The
landed property, premises and furniture have now
been written down to £71,692 ; and that’s a pretty
good indication that the internal position is strong.
The bank has for very many years been able to com-
mand large deposits; its head office is in London, and
no doubt it gathers in a good deal of J. Bull’s invest-
ment money. Not that that is always an advantage
by any means. Whisper in their ear that things
are not going too well, and J. Bull and his northern
brother are very prone to make a sudden call for
their money, on the reasoning that if the eggs were put
in a basket nearer home they would be able to watch
them better. It is cheap money, but mercurial;
and this bank does the only thing that is wise and
safe when it keeps a big liquid reserve. Apart from
bills receivable in London and remittances in transit,
it has £1,774,697 of liquid assets. It owes alto-
gether to the public £5,175,781, so the liquid
assets (apart from remittances, £626,723) are
equal to over 29 p.c. of the total liabilities. The
capital and reserves combined total £1,000,004 ;
there is thus about £5 3s. 6d. of the public’s money
in the business for every £1 belonging to the share-
holders—a very safe proportion; indeed, the bank
on its enlarged capital could, under normal condi-
tions, safely take a good deal more business. Owing
to the new capital and reserves, which have been got
in during the year, it is impossible to say exactly
what the shareholders’ funds earned; apparently,
however, it works out at just about 9 p.c. after pro-
viding for the writings-down already mentioned—
plain proof of a highly profitable business. Of
course there are risks. In a country which has a
furious borrowing spree, and then a painful sobering
up, property values must dart up and down, and
those are just the conditions under which a bank is
liable to make large losses ; for the big borrowing is
very apt to occur while the prices are highest. The
bank which doesn’t put by a substantial proportion
of the profits that it makes in the years of borrow
and boom is, therefore, almost certain to be in
trouble before long. As far as this paper can see,
the National of Maoriland is quite aware of that
fact, and the troubles it can’t avoid it is making
ample provision to meet and overcome.

The past year’s profit was greater than that of any
preceding year in the co.’s history, excepting only
1902, when the co. earned some very fat commis-
sions by the sale of Tyson property. The compara-
tively big figures for the past 12 months result in a
lift being given to the dividend. Also, they no
doubt prompted the chairman, at the annual meet-
ing, to flap his wings and crow tremendously—not
about his co. so much as about the splendid position
of Queensland. “A tide of prosperity has swept
through the country. ... In most branches of civic
and commercial life we are realising the benefit of
congenial and stimulative natural conditions. . . .
The best index to the profitable occupation of the
soil is the traffic on our railways.” The chairman
of a financial concern such as this might at least
have been expected to speak a word of warning
against extravagant borrowing and reckless boom-
ing. The truth is that borrowed money is being
poured out in Queensland, and an atmosphere of
fictitious prosperity is thereby created. This paper
doesn’t say that current natural conditions don’t
favor prosperity. The seasons have been extraor-
dinarily good, and the clips of wool and sales of
live stock have been wonderfully profitable. But a
man who had an income of £lOO one year and sud-
denly got one of £lOOO, may make a worse mess
of things under the new conditions than under the
old ones. It is exactly the same with a State.
Queensland ought to be putting itself in an ex-
tremely solid position; it ought to be preparing
itself to comfortably meet any drought that hap-
pened along. Instead, it is borrowing heavily and spend-
ing lavishly at a time when, there being a keen private
demand for labor and goods, it is getting the
poorest possible value for its money; and by rush-
ing public works, it is disorganising industry, and
private persons are also getting poor value for their
money. “The best index to the profitable occupa-
tion of the soil is the traffic on our railways,” says
the chairman. But a big traffic doesn’t necessarily
mean profitable occupation. The farmer may pay
£5O for freight on his produce; but he may con-
tract the fever, mortgage his property, and, lashing
out into improvements, spend £lOO of the borrowed
money_ on freight on new equipment. Also, the
mere increase of traffic is nothing unless you know
what new lines have been built with borrowed
money, and what the chances are of those lines
earning interest and depreciation in an average
season.
But to come back to the Queensland Trustees. Values
being high, and the property market brisk, com-
missions on sales have no doubt swollen the profits.
And, though the trustee business must grow as the
advantages of appointing a professional trustee be-
come more generally recognised, it may be taken as
certain that the property market will not remain as
brisk as it is, nor will prices continue as high as
they are. Clients, however, have the satisfaction of
knowing that this eo. is sound ; it guarantees not
only that it will be honest, but also that it will do
what it undertakes as a trustee, the guarantee fund
consisting of £25,250 of pair! capital (ss. per
share) and £176,750 of uncalled capital (355. per
share). The paid capital is all in public securities;
the reserves are in deposits and a composite item
( £8592), described as “Secured loans, investments
and sundry debtors.” Apart from this doubtful
composite item, the shareholders can practically lose
nothing by depreciation of their own securities.
They may—and no doubt will—lose in the matter of
profits by the depreciation of other securities, for
obviously, when an estate is worth £20,000, the
co.’s 2i p.c. on the corpus is worth £5OO, whereas
when it shrinks to £15,000, the' same 2$ p.c. only
produces £375. And the same with the 2$ p.c.
which the co. collects as a rule on the annual in-
come of an estate in hand.

This co. has done a considerable agency business
besides acting as trustee; until recently it repre-
sented the Norwich Union Insurance office, but the
latter has opened up on its own account in Dunedin,
and has taken over this co.’s manager and insur-
ance staff. Presumably that will make a cut into
the profits. In fact, the past year’s results are on
the small side; nevertheless, the directors bump up
the rate of dividend, though it was already very
juicy. The reserves certainly are large by com-
parison with the capital ; but the capital isn’t the
right basis for a comparison. On the contrary, the
smaller the capital the larger the reserves ought to
be in a business of this kind. The co. owes
£15,053. Apparently this is money borrowed to
lend out again—a dangerous practice for a trustee
co. to adopt; for a trustee co.’s capital and reserves
should be wholly available as a fund to safeguard
the interests of persons who make the co. their trus-
tees, executors or agents; and the money isn’t
wholly and exclusively available for that purpose
when it has to protect borrowed money. Fortu-
nately, in this case the amount involved is not
large ; but it is a bad principle, and the law should
not allow it in Maoriland any more than it does in
Victoria, whose company law is, on the whole, the
best in Australasia. There is one other unsatisfac-
tory feature—the vague description of the assets.
For instance, “Debentures, £10,100.” Debentures
may be almost anything; the Stannary Hills Co.
(Adelaide), for instance, issued debentures which a
while ago were exchanged for shares at the rate of
10s. in the £, and those shares haven’t any im-
mediate prospect of dividends. The capital of the
co. is in 25,000 shares paid to 7s. 6d. ( £9375),
with a liability of £3 17s. 6d. ; and the net re-
turn for the past year on capital and reserves com-
bined was a shade under 10 p.c.—a very luscious re-
turn if the investments are as gilt-edged as a trus-
tee co.’s investments ought to be.

This co. has been up against keen electrical compe-
tition, and big consumers have no doubt been able
to command cut rates. Consequently, the profits
are less than they were seven or eight years ago,
in spite of the accumulation of over £15,000 of
visible and, presumably, revenue-producing reserves.
Seven years ago (Jan.-June, 1904), with assets total-
ling £137,335, the co. had a gross revenue of
£12,277; for the past half-year, with assets total-
ling £152,431, the gross revenue was £11,270, and
that isn’t the sort of movement to give three cheers
about. Certainly even now there is a pretty wide
margin between the declared profit and the amount
called for to satisfy the 10 p.c. dividend; but it is
quite possible that some of that margin isn’t real
profit. Thus £l5OO of the surplus for the past
half-year is transferred to the plant renewal and
contingency account, and £3OO to the Waterloo lease
reserve account, and, after those appropriations,
there isn’t much surplus left. But it doesn’t follow
that all of that £lBOO is required to provide for
current depreciation, inasmuch as maintenance and
current renewals have been charged up to working
expenses. As previously mentioned, the co. has been
up against electrical competition, the principal com-
petitor being the Standard-Waygood Co. It has
been suggested at various times that, instead of
cutting throats, these two should amalgamate; and
it seems that, at least, friendly relations have been
established. On the recent retirement of veteran
John Pope from the Board, his place was taken by
I. B. Nicholson, who is one of the principals in the
Standard-Waygood Co. Simultaneously the Hydraulic
and Engineering Co., which was a pup of this co.’s,
has been amalgamated with another engineering co. It
may be that other changes will transpire presently.
Whoever owns this co.’s Parliamentary rights will,
no doubt, have to observe the provision under
which the City Council can claim as much of the
profit in excess of 10 p.c. as the co. itself distributes
—a fact which must, of course, be taken into ac-
count in appraising the value of the shares as an
investment.

Still “nil” in the column to which the weary share-
holder’s eyes turn most longingly! It has been a
wearying business altogether. In the old days, with
a stiff State tariff, the co. did moderately well.
Then came the hybrid thing produced bv the first
Commonwealth Parliament, when Australia, though
it wanted, and knew it wanted, high Protection, re-
turned George Reids and Joe Cooks, and presumably
expected them to vote for the thing they had cursed.
By the time Australia had wakened up to the fact
that it had been a fool, this co. was in such a bad
way that it was touch-and-go with it altogether.
Then came a slightly improved tariff ; but the co. had
gone so far to leeward that it had to write off half
its capital as utterly lost; and if in the future any
people talk of reducing duties, this experience ought
to be flung at them hard. Gradually things are
righting themselves; and in a year or two, perhaps,
when the plant has been written down to
its true value, and contingencies reasonably
provided for, a little mouse of a dividend
may be permitted to creep out; and this
paper hopes the delay won’t be long. The trouble
with nearly all these manufacturing industries that
depend on a Protective duty is that the capital has
been inadequate. Naturally, when the duty is liable
to be knocked out, with the result that half the
capital is lost in three or four years, investors won’t
cheerfully come along with money ; so accommoda-
tion has to be got, often at ruinous rates, from banks
and other pawnshops, because such manufacturing
industries simply must have up-to-date plant. As
at June, 1907, after the cleaning-up, this co. owed
the Q. N. Bank no less than £22,944 (its own capi-
tal had been written down to £23,339). Fortu-
nately, it has been able to pull through without
increasing that amount —partly by means of undi-
vided profit, partly by going out of the retail busi-
ness, and thus reducing its stocks, and partly bv
reason of a fire that occurred last year, which, though
it disorganised trade, made a bit of insurance money
available. On June 30 of this year the overdraft was
thus down to £16,608. What the co. needs now is
an assurance that there will be no monkeying with
the Protective policy. It is in this connection that
one rebels against Hughes’s proposal to cut the duty
away even from the sugar business. If in that or
this or any other industry the employers are not
doing fairly by either the public or their employees,
other steps must be taken. The duty is in the
interests of Australia; and when you cut away the
duty it is the Commonwealth you hurt. And, in
the second place, this co., besides an assurance of
Protection, needs a great and growing Australian
faith in Australian goods—a faith which it is only
fair to say is, and has for years past been, more con-
spicuous in Queensland than in any other State.

The reserves consist of unappropriated profit £3042,
and a depreciation fund £2611. The directors’ re-
port says: “The whole of the co.’s assets have been
re-valued, and ample provision made for deprecia-
tion” ; but it is not plain whether that pro-
vision is independent of the depreciation reserve or
not. _ Of course, if the depreciation fund is merely a
provision to cover an ascertained shrinkage of values,
it isn’t a reserve at all, and it ought to be wiped
right out. It is quite possible, however, that the
fund is a provision for contingencies-—that is to say,
for losses or shrinkages not yet actually ascertained.
The matter should be made clearer. The co. has had
mixed experiences. Founded in 1886, it soon began
handing out 10 p.c. sweets. Then the bitters of the
early ’9o’s had to be swallowed, and not only were
no dividends paid for many years, but a good deal
of capital was forfeited. Of recent years fair pro-
gress has been made in quitting properties that got
into the co.’s hands ; but it is doubtful whether, in
spite of the re-valuation, all the remaining properties
would fetch book-values if they were forced to a
sale. The holding of productive house and unpro-
ductive land property is lumped into one item. It
is to be hoped there isn’t much suburban-Newcastle
land in the lump; for that is an asset which takes a
lot of shifting. It certainly looks as though there
might be a fair amount of it, inasmuch as freeholds
and leaseholds, valued at £13,006 (after writing off
the depreciation reserve), brought in last year a net
revenue of only £416, which is only a drink or so
more than 3 p.c. The most cheerful feature is the
steady increase of advances (borrowers’ and land pur-
chasers’ balances). This shows: —

Properties .. 24,248 17,178 15,399 15,306 15,617
The advances have thus just about doubled in the 12
years, and about half the increase has come from the
sale of properties. The balance required to accom-
modate the customers has come from depositors.
That means some risk; still the deposits and other
liabilities are comparatively small. The creditors
are thus well protected; their money would be all
right even if the assets were knocked down by some
calamity till they were worth only Bs. in the £ of
their book-value. There appear to be no prospects
of anything fat for shareholders; on the other hand,
there is no reason to expect any bump of an un-
pleasant sort, though a mining town is a mining
town, which is another way of saying that it is full
of vicissitudes, and the less a person with a weak
heart has to do with the whole tribe of mining towns
the better.

The true profits for the half-year are evidently less
than shown in the last line, because the additions
to reserves include an amount put to a depreciation
fund for works on a leasehold, as well as £lOOO put
to a general renewal reserve. In fact, the additions
to these reserves absorb practically the whole of the
surplus profit after paying the dividend ; but whether
they are more than a fair set-off against current de-
preciation The Bulletin doesn’t know, and couldn’t
find out if it kept the accounts on the dissecting
table for a month. In one respect those accounts
might be a lot more specific. Indeed, it is possible
that they are actually misleading. In this way.
Assets include —“Plant at cost, less depreciation
written off, £11,971,” and “Mains and services,
less depreciation written off, £17,986.” Now, some
years ago, it was the practice to visibly write off
something every term; but it is doubtful whether
anything at all has been written off in recent years.
If "so, it would be much better to say “Less depre-
ciation written off to 31/12/1908,” or whenever the
last amount disappeared. It may be, certainly, that
the items are still being written down ; if that is so,
it is equally advisable to make it plain. But while
the exact position of the co. is so doubtful, it is
quite clear that the business has made rapid pro-
gress. Seven years ago, in the first half of 1904,
the total revenue was £2729; for the past half-year
it was £5/21, or more than double. No new can'
JfA, h > aS bee f go } ln meantime - nor have anv liab/ii-

about the same now as they were then. Either then

worlts have been constructed; and whichever it is
the shareholders have good cause to feel that life

The largest item, it will be noticed, is Renewal

ever, it is safe to say, isn’t the only provision made

to provide for special renewals and contingencies.

surplus of assets over liabilities has increased bv
£14,416 in the same period. Therefore, all the
plant extensions, renewals, etc., made in the 10 years,
including the big works now in progress, have been
paid for out of profits, except for £26,586 (the dif-
ference between £41,002 and £14,416). In other
words,_ the co.’s surplus profits in excess Of the 15
p.c. dividend have been so great during the past 10
years that they have paid for all the plant exten-
sions, etc., except £26,586 worth. How much sur-
plus profit really has been put into extensions there
is no way of telling; but the extensions must have
been very considerable, because the revenue from
sales in the first half of 1901 was £10,488, whereas
for the past half-year it was no less than £19,716,
in spite of small reductions in the selling price of
gas. Whether this and similar cos. are going to be
permitted to browse in their sweet patch of clover
The Bulletin doesn’t know ; but the investor who
doesn't take into account the possibilities of the
municipalities taking over the business of supply-
ing public utilities like light and power is liable
some day to feel sorry for himself.

spite of the recent purchases, the liquid assets
(mostly cash) total £21,932, while the total liabili-
ties are £2192. The half-year’s declared profits, as
the table shows, were £2558, but how much was
written off property, ostensibly to cover deprecia-
tions, this paper can’t say. The provision has for
many years past been on the very safe side. The co

The Australasian Wireless Co., Ltd., was
formed some months ago to take over the patent
rights m the Telefunken system—the one that has
been adopted by the Commonwealth in connection
with the Pennant Hills (Sydney) and Fremantle
stations. Subsequently the Marconi people raised
the question whether the Telefunken (and, therefore,
the Australasian Wireless Co.) had any legal rights.
The doubt was apparently based on a recent British
case; and, as the matter was of supreme importance
to the co., the opinion of the most eminent Austra-
lian patents counsel, H. Leverrier, K.C., was taken.
“In my opinion,” he reports, “the judgment of Mr.
Justice Parker in the case of Marconi v. British
Radio-Telegraph and Telephone Co., so far from
tending to establish that the Telefunken quenched
singing spark system is an infringement of Marconi’s
British patent, No. 7777, affords the strongest pos-
sible grounds for coming to the contrary con-
clusion.” Counsel proceeds to say that “the essential
features” of the Marconi patent were “most care-
fully ascertained and defined by” the Judge, and,
“generally speaking, the essential features of the
Telefunken system are the very reverse of those of
the Marconi system.” Neither the Telefunken Co.
(Europe) nor the Australasian "Wireless Co.’s di-
rectors appear to have ever had any doubts about it,
and have offered to give practically unlimited guar-
antees to the Government and other users; and if
the shareholders have had any doubts, the advising
of Leverrier, K.C., ought to aibout settle them.

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous, and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order; furthermore, work, is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-

Extract from the Saturday Review, 7th January,
1911, —“Insurance —-A Colonial Mutual Departure:
Policies, combining life or endowment assurance
with other benefits, are gradually coming into favor.
Their popularity seems to be justified. Why should
one be compelled to take out two or more policies
when several risks can just as easily be covered
under a single contract? It was a consideration of
this kind that some short time ago impelled the
Board of The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
to introduce in Australasia a combined Life, Acci-
dent and Sickness policy, and as the experiment was
attended by a most welcome increase in New Busi-
ness, it was recently decided to extend the issue to
the United Kingdom. There were evidently sound
reasons for the departure. Neither life nor endow-
ment assurance policies afford quite the full protec-
tion needed by most persons, because no provision is
made for accidents or sickness that do not end
fatallv. . . ■ Regarded as a whole, this new policy
possesses many attractions. It is decidedly cheap,
and will appeal to those who cannot afford to dis-
burse large sums yearly in the form of insurance
premiums.”* # *

justification for these bites; the best that can be said
for them is that they are little ones Certainly the
promoters pass on an idea that looks to be worth
somethin"- the co. intends to reach out the most
strenuously for Industrial business, and, in connec-
tion with that in particular, it is intended to adopt
the fire-insurance cos.' system of relying laigely on
the collection of premiums by country storekeepers,
etc. In this way it is not unreasonably expected
that expenses will be reduced, and a new crop of
insurers harvested. And, following on a reduction of
expenses it would of course be possible to give
cheaper insurance, either by lower rates, or through
larger bonuses. (It is proposed to give bonuses to
Industrial as well as Ordinary insurers.) Share-
holders, after getting 10 p.c. on their capital, are to
be entitled to share to the extent of 20 p c. of the
profits; the other 80 p.c. goes to policy-holders. r l he
scheme depends almost wholly on the management;
in that connection C. G. Marriott Watson (head of
the Australasian department of the Royal) figures as
provisional manager and promoter, and E. S. Wolfen-
den, of the A.M.P., as provisional actuary. Both
are experienced men. # #
The Merchants and Shippers Steam Navi-
gation, Ltd., contemplates an issue of 190,000 7i
nc. cumulative preference shares of £ 1 each. It
is understood that this co. has six 10,000 ton cargo
steamers being built for the Australian, American,
Canadian and European trade, and has expert, ship-
ping management in Australia and England.
Captain Cowling, an old S. Aus. copper
man —for years he managed the Yelta and Para-
matta —has' been up looking at the lodes near
Drake (N.S.W.), on an Adelaide commission. The
chief properties thereabouts, the Pioneer and the
Adeline, were worked for gold; but Cowling has so
good an opinion of them as copper propositions that
he thinks if they were in his own beloved South Aus.
there would be a few hundred men at work on
them. # #
The big plant of the liquidated Mount
Dromedarv G. M. Co. (N.S.W.) has been sold at
scrap-heap price to a Sydney speculator, and unless
it can be satisfactorily rented, or resold to some-
body who will have another go at the goldstreaks in
the"hill, it will be dismantled and carted away. If
so, the only miner left on the once busy goldfield
will be a lonesome delver still battling away m
Bailey’s claim. At the present time this sticker has
180 ft. to drive through rotten country before he can
hope to strike the reef he is hunting for ; and as the
work is extremely arduous, owing to constant in-
rushes of spewy clay, he advances at the rate of
inches per week. A man wants a breast like a bul-
lock to tackle a job like that single-handed.
* * * *
Harden (N.S.W.) has started to stope
the rich ore developed on the western side of the
shaft, so, in spite of the poor show in No. 5, there
is a slightly improved demand for shares. Costs
have exceeded the revenue for some time past, so
shareholders will welcome a good crushing. Last
month the return from 611 tons was £1205, but
costs swallowed £1430. Much better results are
now expected, and the more effective pumping should
lower costs a bit.
* * * *
Murchison Associated Co. has been fooled
so often in Westralia that the wonder is it
doesn’t pack up and get. At one time it owned a
big area at Day Dawn —an area which in the be-
ginning had all the Fingall shoots going through it,
and in the end had none at all. Having got the pip
over this set-back, the co. went to sleep in a corner
for some years; but in November last it woke up
and got hold of something at Bullfinch, which, like
almost everything else in that over-boomed locality,
proved to be a rotter. Ennuin was then selected as
the most suitable spot for the co. to retrieve its
fortunes, and a group of leases, which as late as a
month ago were said to have first-rate prospects, was
acquired on appro. Now comes the laconic an-
nouncement that the option has been abandoned.
A fter this the co. will probably stick to rubber
plantations, some interests in which enabled it to
pav a small dividend about a year ago.
* * * *
Shareholders whose illusions have not yet
gone may find comfort in the following yarn, spun
by managing-director Pettigrew about the Baby-
lonian, Pine Hill and Greenfinch (W.A.) : lhe
Babylonian is now working on a reef about 2 it.
wide, from which it is preparing to crush 50 tons,
averaging 2oz. ... So far, 400 tons of ore,
which, including tailings gold, has yielded over -,oz.
per ton, have been taken out of the Pine Hill shaft
down to 70ft. . . . For every foot of sinking since
the reef entered the shaft nine tons of ore has been
won. . . . The mine is now self-supporting. • • •
The Greenfinch reef has been tested to 100 ft., and is
ready for stoping. Arrangements will shortly be
made to take out the ore from the 60ft. level to the
surface, and send it to Kalgoorlie for treatment, it
is expected that about 1600 tons, averaging about
40z., will be obtained.” In the meantime, Babylonians
and Pine Hills are quoted at about sd. wholesale and
6d. retail, while Greenfinches can be had m flocks
to suit purchasers at a bit over 2s.
Three fairly big mining deals have been
fixed up during the last week or two in the
West. Mackey, Nardin and party have passed the
Transvaal, at Southern Cross, on to the Oroya bx-
ploration, Ltd., for £ll,OOO cash and 11,000 shares ;
Oates’s Hidden Treasure, at Cue, has been acquired
by Chesson and Hay don for £35,000 cash; and J.
Ryan has become proprietor of the Marmont, at
Meekatharra, by purchasing Caleb James s share.
A number of cos. which dropped part_ of their
bundle at Bullfinch are working options in various
parts of the State, and one or two more sales are
tipped to take place before the end of the month.
Bullrush Estates, Ltd., is alleged to have
missed a good thing in the Reidell show at Mount
Jackson. The co. had the property under option tor
a limited period for £5OOO, but thought it too
small. Since then, at least £2OOO worth of ore is
said to have been dug out in the course of develop-
ment down to a depth of 60ft., and the sale price
has appreciated in the eyes of the present owners
to something over £lO,OOO. So far the reef averages
about 12in., and assays (apart from specimen
patches) several ounces per ton. It is easily the
best thing yet unearthed in the Jackson district, but
whether it will last in depth is another matter.
* * * *
A Southern . Cross man who ought to
know, writes that the Doolettes and Robinsons have
taken the Corinthian North off the Oroya Explora-
tion Co.’s hands, and, after doing a bit more de-
velopment, intend to offer it to the public at a b »
figure. A lot of good ore is stated to be already in
sight, while the Corinthian (wnich is just alongside,
and is likely to be included in the flotation) re-
cently treated a few hundred tons of stuff, of a gross
value of about 23dwt., and is now putting through
some more of the same kind. Over-capitali-
sation, however, is likely to smother the chances o
anv co. that may be formed to work the two Pro-
perties. Even the Bullfinch is afflicted a little in
this way. # *
In reply to several anxious inquiries, The
Bulletin supplies the sorrowful information that
the present worldly possessions of the Star Explora-
tion (W.A.) are a heap of old residues on the Han-
nan’s Star lease, a doubtful sort of option at Meeka-
tharra and an interest in the Mountain Queen at
Southern Cross. At the time of its liquidation the
Hannan’s Star held a share in a pub,
but whether this was handed over to the Exploration,
along with the other things, is not clear.
Brilliant Stockholm, Charters Towers,
finished its half-year with a credit of £2993. Bur
ing the six months, 6173 tons were crushed and to
keep things going, £3754 was spent on development.
The latest crushing was 791 tons for £36-7, ai
average of £4 11s. 9d. No. 9 level is the deepest,
and the western stopes carry from Ift. to 2fit. oi
heavy mineral; 15in. of good stone is showing at
146 ft. from the crosscut. But the Stockholm is
patchy, and mining costs are heavy. In the other
property the co. has spent a lot of money ontheold
Brilliant shaft, and is now down to the Bay Dawn
formation; but these workings are in a bad state,
so progress is very slow.
* * *
There were mild ructions at the Brilliant
and St. George meeting at Charters Towers, held
for the purpose of winding-up the old co. and foiru-
ng a new one. The old co. has had a, varied life
21 years. In the first eight it paid just upon
£BOO,OOO in divs., but it has long since ceased to
atten anybody, though it has kept a few of the
Towers contingent in very comfortable perks. me
present idea is to form' a New Brilliant and St
George Co., in 250,000 shares of ss. each, 72,000
paids will go in exchange for the 144,000 sjiares in
the old co., and another 144,000 may be taken with
a liability of 3s. The other 34,000 shares are to be
kept to play with. Dr. Redmond an ancient thorn
in the flesh of the ruling magnates of the lowers,
had an idea that if there weren’t so many kangers-
on the co. could pull through without reconstruc-
tion ; but there wasn’t the smallest hope of anything
of that kind being listened to, and the meeting ended
with “liar” on one side and “gagged on the other.
* * * *
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers,
Crushed 4480 tons for £11.152, which includes
£2lOO from cyanide. The profit was £3548, or
more than double the previous month s. It is pro-
bable that the Extended will follow up this imple-
ment in grade with a dividend; 6d. costs £<»-50.
The total paid so far is £112,250 or 9s. per share
The deepest level (No. 20) is showing somewhat
better prospects in the end of the eastern level, and
also in the rise from the west level on the hanging-
wall reef. Still, the stone from No. 20 has
mineral, which is a poor sign on this field. Reserves
are 50,000 tons.
* * * *
Great Fitzroy (Q.) begins to look as
though it has a chance. Last month s run ga\ e
£14,022, of which £1346 was earned by converting
accumulated matte; the balance (£12,076) averages
£2 3s. sd. on the 5568 tons of ore smelted. Assays
were 3.46 p.c. copper and 3.2dwt. gold, which is
slightly better than usual. Still, costs tor
the month are heavy; they represent per
ton on the 190 tons of blister. 8., M. and Co. esti-
mated reserves at £2. 6s. per ton, with copper at
£6O and promised that costs would be cut down
below 30s. per ton. The firm has thus much to do
vet before it can make good. The month s gross
profit was £4072, but out of that have to come capi-
tal expenditure, debenture interest, and administiative
costs. Capital expenditure has, however, been re-
duced in order to allow the heavily-loaded concern to
get its second # *
Mount Cuthbert (Q.) takes a more hope-
ful view since a railway irom Cloncurry to a Ueep-
water Gulf port—if one can be found—has been
talked about, more particularly as some of the talk
is done by Premier Denham. The Queensland Harbor
Department has appointed a man to search for such
a port at the mouth of the Norman or elsewhere;
and he hasn’t got an easy job ahead of him. Mount
Cuthbert is 78 miles from Cloncurry. The mine is
developed to a depth of 350 ft., and appears to con-
tain a large tonnage of 8 p.c. ore. The proposal to
issue a block of new shares to a broking firm has
been turned down ; F. E. Power the big Queensland
shareholder, may have got a hint about the railway
scheme. # • *
Gehenna ! The Queensland Miners’ Health
Commission elicited the fact that there are _ corners
in the sulphide zone of the Mount Elliott mine that
generate an air temperature of 101 Fahr., with
complete saturation. This heat is accounted for by
the oxidation of the sulphur in the ore.
The Mount Perry (Q.) Copper Co. has
closed down its smelters and stopped its reduction
works. Mining, however, will be continued and the
ore will be sent to Port Kembla (N.S.W.) smelt-
ing works, where, it is said, the reduction can be
done as cheaply as at Mount Perry. The coi will
continue the development of the property, and may
resume smelting at the old address when the copper
market improves. # *
The Queensland Colliery Co., at Howard,
near Maryborough (Q.), has an area of 2100 acres.
It has two pits at work mining coal from three
seams The first band of fuel was struck at 70ft.;
the deepest is at 200 ft. The seams average about
3ft which is a mere nothing compared with some ot
the seams in Central Bananaland, y e * the output is
80,000 tons a year approximately. The Dundee col-
lierv, at the same place, has an output of 1400 tons
a month, and is at present financing a coal-prospect-
ing area at Torbanlea, near by, where six bores have
been put down. Only “promising results have so
far been got—and thev are not combustible Apart
from coal, the Maryborough district is dead, in a
mining manner of speaking. Biggenden, where a
struggling bismuth show exists; Eidsvold, one of
Queensland’s earliest fields; and Paradise, the haunt
now of only a fossicker or so —these only add to the
gloom. # *
Minister Mcßride, the least fatigued nieni-
ber of the Wearv (Vic.) Cabinet, thinks of trying
to persuade the Government to go into the business
of iron smelting and steel-producing as a State in-
dustry. He would use the iron deposits of the
Blvtlie River (Tas.), only 130 miles away, by water
from the coal at Wonthaggi. The coal se far mined
there is, however, poor coking coal, and is PJ°ha y
too friable to be effective for smelting. Mcßride
hopes harder coal may be found ; if not ' ! ie J 0
bring coke from Newcastle (N.S.W.). Private En-
terprise has had close noon 100 years to start the
business. Now. Private Enterprise having neglected its
opportunities, Mcßride recognises that it is up to the
State, as the biggest customer for iron and'steel, to
go into the business—the one business which a coun-
trv must have in order to become great.
Victorian gold yield for the past seven
months is 258,2950 z. fine, or 30,4160 z less than the
return for the same part of 1910. This is the fact
that makes the path hard for the men who want to
lift the sweated miner of Bendigo and Ballarat to a
wage out of which he can save a few pence against
the day he has to own up to miner s complaint.
One A. S. Woolcott, of the Frenchman s Reef, Dayles-
ford bewails the outlook for that show if it has to
move up the wage-scale any farther. A mine that
has taken four years to get £28,500 of gold isn t
much of an ornament to the industry, no matter how
it may figure on the Stock Exchange list. It is not
quße the same with the Lord Nelson, about which
Lort Smith whined a week or two ago. Divs. there
came in and out of season; but the Board had so
little foresight that it wouldn’t take the North Lord
Nelson lease when it could have had it for a bundle
of chips. That it has had to amalgamate, with an
unwieldy share-register, isn’t any excuse for keeping
a fair wage from men who go underground, Peter
Mcßride had the big heart to see that, and he has
the backbone to ask whether it is not better to pre-
serve health than to help a lot of stringers drag out
a wearv existence.
* * * *
Old Jubilee is an antique among Dayles-
ford (Vic.) mines. Dating back to the first boom,
it drew little Merson Cooper (of John Goodall s)
and a few original Ballaratites into a giddy game
of ins and outs. They paid calls and had their ex-
perience. Old Jubilee since then has been a sucker
of cash and a peg on which moths, hunting for
riches have hung their hopes. These people got
severe palpitation last week when word was passed
along that rich stone had been cut in the bottom
drive. A box of specimens put in an appearance at
the office; they were very pretty, but it is not the
first time patches have been got. So while en
thusiasts went blind, old hands sat in the market
doing the goose-plucking game. More castles are
being built with the box of specimens as the founda-
tion-stone than would house the Australian army.
The point is overlooked that the shoot lias already
pinched, and that the gold contents have declined.
So away floats another pretty little bubble.*
Sydney folk had a try at a show at Gua-
dalcanal, in the South Seas, piloted by one Charles
E. Young. Now Melbourne is to sample what Sydney
has almost forgotten. A little co. of 300 shares of £lO
each takes the rights, title and all that sort of thing
to 25 square miles of kind at. Guadalcanal acquired
from the dusky chiefs of the island For such
rights, 100 paids up to the vendors, and an-
other 100 provide the means to send a Party
of Victorian miners to do the prospecting. The o
Sydney expedition got 19 tons, going 7dwt. per ton,
but this was not thought to be convincing. Hence
Queen-street’s opportunity. * #
Maoriland’s outside goldfields on the Coro-
mandel Peninsula keep plugging away, with moder-
ate results. At Waitekaun, over the hills from
Waihi, the Maoriland has just got £464 from 187
tons, and has been doing something similar for a
good while past. Golden Cross, same district, is
about to start its battery, and intends to work some
of the ground abandoned by the unsuccessful Eng-
lish co. North of Thames, the Monowai (formerly
English, and a failure) has, during a few months,
got £3480 from 1617 tons. Concentrates are shipped
for foreign treatment; 35 tons have produced
£2298. Kuaotuna and Tairua fields also hawe small
producers. In the Reefton (5.1.) district, New Big
River has just announced £2570 from 600 tons,
and its 30th div. of Is. per share.

Crown and Golden Crown, Thaines (M.L.),
which are being developed with Sydney capital,
under the management of S. T. WiHiams from
nimrters Towers, are opening up well, ana ian re
turns should soon be heard of. This 9°: bf, s ’ s d Q u
the last few weeks, secured an additional 50-acre
lease containing a big reef, giving assays of
£3 10s. 6d. per ton. If the mill trials show values
50 p.c. of that, it should grow into one of the
largest mining propositions in the Dominion.
Tongkali, the Siamese dredging concern
with its head office in Tasmania, continues to issue
verv impressive figures. Last months run .gave
Ifli tons of tin oxide. The shareholders get mighty
little information; they don t even know the assay,
of the concentrates, let alone the price realised. A
that is certain is that the dredges have to go to the
hospital pretty often, and that the fleet of five Plie
up a heavv bill for depreciation and repairs. As to
costs the old records show them to be heavy, a shade
over sd. per cubic yard. But that scrap of informa-
tion doesn’t help much when the quantity handled is
kept a secret, and the quantity available for hand-
ling is the same sort of mystery.
“Mallarapoonie”; The Bulletin spoke
a true word the other day (6/7/’ll) when it re ;
marked that Dagoes were being stacked into the
Outback mines of Westralia in contravention of the
mininsr laws. Many of the new arrivals from Italy

the mining cos. in this State, are not only unac-
quainted with Shakspeare’s language, and arent
even on nodding terms with plain Bill. im lingo, ana

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 14, 1911.
My Dear Arini, —
1 reemasons blazed in bullion at their
hop the other night. The Town Hall was
the prancing ground of these gay bower-
birds. Colored lights were flicked on to
Worshipful Grand Masters, Royal Arches,
Masons, and other glittering relics of
the Early Ages. A Personage who looked
like a cut-glass decanter hopped nimbly
round in the mazy waltz with a mere
woman. Lieut.-Gov. Cullen and his lady,
Right Worshipful Brother Shipway and
Mrs. Shipway, Mayoress Allen Taylor, R.W.
Brother Sly and Mrs. Sly, and Commander
and Mrs. Brownlow tripped round in a blaze
of glory reflected in the magnificent apparel
of other Worshipful Brothers and their
dames, who were heavily laden with gauds.
The heralds, blowing a mighty blast from
their trumpets, apparently awakened the
dead, who made a hurried resurrection and
tumbled into the ballroom from the vestibule
and other haunts of departed spirits ; and Cru-
saders, Knights Templar; Knights of the Red
Cross, and other antiquities, clutching at
their drapery, scampered into line and
ducked their heads to the Arch of Steel,
which industriously sliced the air with
shivery blades.
At midnight, or thereabouts, a Freemason
slips out of his absurd little apron—there
never seem to be any knots in the tapes—
passes it on to his dame (or someone else’s
dame) as a trimming for which he has no
immediate use, mops his brow, loosens his
collar, and attacks the supper table.
Careless persons who step into Sydney
Harbor, or fall into Parramatta River, are
apparently shadowed by young children who
promptly haul them out again. The countrv
waterhole is another favorite place for sud-
den immersion, followed by the breathless
appearance of a life-saver in knickerbockers.
At the Shipwreck Relief and Humane So-
caety’s medal display, the other evening,
liieut.-Gov. Cullen’s dame presented a baby
in breeches, named Kelvin McCallum (aged
8), with a fragment of bronze and a cer-
tificate. Kelvin, at some inconvenience to
himself, swam into a deep waterhole, and
saved the lives of two friends and a brother.
The recklessly-audacious infant had to dive
for the third life. Lilian Saunders, aged 10,
in a blue nautical dress, took a reef "in the
collar of each tar who carried her up to the
platform for her share of the entertainment.
Robert V. ,T. Dunn, aged 10; Cecil Gray (11)
an d Garibaldi Cuneo, a comparative oldster
of 14, were also included in the juvenile con-
tingent who got away with certificate? for
doing their litle bit at the right time.
Harold Baker and James darken, heroes
°f the Coogee surf tragedy last January, got
gold medals and some framed letterpress for
(heir heroic efforts to fish drowning damsels
out of heaving green seas.
The Town Hall was packed to its last
air-hole for this medal display. The Admir-
able King-Hall, Captain Green and Mr.
Men vale supported the Lieut.-Gov.’s pan-
egyric, and offered some encouragement to
foolish persons to fall into deep water. The
speakers all meant well; but their remarks,
muffled by much platform bunting, were
merely seen by half of those present. The
Balmain District Choral Union put in a
busy evening, yet showed no signs of ex-
haustion when “God Save” emptied the Town
Hall into George-street.
Aurora Australis was present at the
Glaciarium carnival, but Mary Queen of
Scots gave the other girls a chance and (for
once) remained dead. John Bunyan, Will
Shakspeare and similar frivolous persons
who generally rush a fancy-dress sprint,
were also absent, though A. G. W. Pitt
gave Hamlet a little cheerful exercise on
skates. Mr. W. J. Curtis snatched a prize
lor his handsome team, “The Purity Bri-
gade” (“Belle of New York”) ; and Mrs. S.
Q. Hughes for her ice interlude, “Winter
in Greenland,” got away with another prize.
Mr. Breckenridge tossed three ostrich tails
on his head, as the “Black Prince,” and
was rewarded for his trouble; and Miss
Charlton, revolving on the ice patch as a
slender “Sunflower,” captured much ap-
plause and the effective-costume (feminine)
prize. Miss M. Mansell’s ice yacht was a
good-looking affair, built for indoor naviga-
tion; and Mrs. J. Rogalsky’s Esquimau
team, with a juvenile Esquimau like a
ball of white wool tucked up in a sleigh,
was not designed for blizzards. Miss Stella
Chisholm’s Cingalee team was sprinkled
with tea-planters, and Dr. W. S. Brooks and
Dr. Broughton skimmed round in the revel.
In Mr. C. F. Smith’s group, “Prehistoric,”
long-haired Man, untamed by huckaback
waistcoats or floral socks, pursued his lady
with the knobby end of a club. In spite of
the irregular behavior of searchlights,
this years carnival was a handsome
pageant, served un with Polar bears on ice.
. The ’Varsity Dramatic Society played
Pinero’s mild comedy, “The Hobby Horse,”
on two successive evenings last week, in St.
James’s Hall, without extensive breakages."
The scenery, by Mr. Harry Whaite, was so
deceptive that, whenever Mr. A. Consett
Stephen (Spencer Jermyn) got into a flurry,
he tried to walk through a painted hedge.
Mr. M. Consett Stephen (Lawyer Pinching)
nearly escaped at the end of the first act
into a nicely-shaded garden path, and Miss
K. Lyons introduced earthquake effects by
leaning too suddenly against the exterior
of Mr. Jermyn's country house. Mr. Sandy
McLeod and Mr. R. Kidston, as “decayed
horsemen,” had thin, curly legs and uncer-
tain habits. Mrs. E. Iv. Knowles, formerly
Lily Titheradge, brought her knowledge of
stage-craft along, and propped up “The
Hobby Horse” as pretty Mrs. Jermyn. On
Saturday night the hall was filled with
evening dress. Girls in trencher boards and
other ’ Varsity plumage walked over the feet
of the unwary, and persistently sold sweets
to young men in swallow-tails. Prof. Wil-
son (who demonstrates in bones) and Mrs.
Wilson looked in. Mrs. McCallum and
Mrs. David arrived hetwen the rain droos.
Chancellor MacLaurin was ear-marked for
a chair of state, with a green drape
hanging down its back, and sat on it
with caution. There was nothing hidden
underneath, and he retired peacefully into
the programme.
A benefit matinee last week encouraged
the bright and saucy Nell Finnis to continue
spraining ankle-joints on the ice, by hand-
ing her the sum of £l6B. This will buy her
several pairs of new skates, and keep her
telephone in repairs while she answers mes-
sages of sympathy. 11. B. Irving, at the
tribute to the girl’s late limp, was inimit-
able in some comic recitations. The melan-
choly appearance of this great English mum-
mer gives mirth the unexpected edge which
sharpens the gravedigger’s quips in an open
vault. Langford Kirby wore the princely
gaud that glittered over his collar-stud in
“The Balkan Princess,” and other garments
suitable to the occasion. Kirby and Thelma
Prendergast went over the old Balarian argu-
ment: “I wonder who’s kissing her now V” as
if they rather enjoyed riddles. The average
mummer would have to be fastened with a
burglar-proof padlock to his hotel balcony to
prevent his rushing to the aid of a damsel
who wasn’t in distress, and every theatre
and music-hall in this city hurled 'its talent
at the mended foot of Nell Finnis.

The Palace Theatre is full of juvenile
dimples, giggles, dolls, school-bags, and grow-
ing legs. “The Old Woman who lived in a
Shoe” is a mature person of uncertain age
—twelve or thereabouts —and she’s sur-
rounded by “ladies of the ballet” with small,
plump bodies, who dance on springs and
absorb chocolates when they’re not drinking
m arithmetic at St. John’s School. Four
“mothers” look after the minor morals
(darning stockings, getting off to school in
time, etc.) of the jolly youngsters who travel
round the earth under the wing of benign
“Sahib” Liddiard, a determined bachelor in
private life. On Saturday afternoon the
Palace was too full of children to hold an-
other dimple. Behind the scenes the co.
had stage-manager Bryer to keep its spirits
in a foam of frivolous mirth. Gentle-man-
nered and well-cared for. these cheerful imos
have ridden over the Philippines, taken tiffin
in India, giggled at mandarins in China,
and scampered back to Australia, vav
healthy, and only spoilt by “the Sahib”
when the “mothers” are not looking.
The threatened departure of Chamberlain
victor Hood for the Cold Country will make
the new Gov.-Gen. Denman an orphan with
a bright green staff. Mr. Hood’s body was
shaken up by a motor spill 12 months ago.
and his nerves are going to take a rest cure'.
He is now getting them ironed out in a pri-
vate hospital.
A training school for nice-mannered
young immigrants as gentleman-helps to
strange Governors, is suggested as a tad to
the Compulsory Service Act. The wreckage
of tempers that occurs when new popinjays
at Gov. House handle the free-food list,
causes anguished wails amongst social climb-
ers. Mr. Hood knew things, and responded
to his Victorian schooling. After Lord Dick
Nevill packed up his gold braid for Europe,
not one member of the casual Lord Dudley’s
haw-haw staff —excepting Private Sec.
Walter Callan —had sense enough to hide his
boredom.
Female millinery is still climbing into
space. The tall crowns of the ’Bl)’s have re-
turned in new colors, with fancy names. A
heavy ladder of roses, going up like a fire-
escape, nods its buds about a foot above the
feminine eyebrow. This is considered a
good investment for small women, who want
to add something to their five feet nothing.
The wide, flat hat remains, nevertheless.
Its mission in life is to comfort the long,
lean slab of feminine bone and sinew, and
pull her out across the head-lines. Last
year’s silk bow, which pushed the floral hat
on to top shelves and other dusty hiding-
places, does not appear in millions. “Miss
Gibbs” was entirely responsible for the bow-
haunted hat of last summer, and the two
have disappeared together.
Miss Fanny Cohen, 8.A., B.Sc., who won
the Barker Travelling Scholarship at the
Sydney Uni., left bv the Goeben on Satur-
day. Some girls demonstrate in new hats;
Fanny Cohen chose geology and mathe-
matics. She’s the first woman here to get
away with a travelling scholarship, and the
Goeben was pursued by three cheers.
Ethel Irving has been impounded for an
appearance at the matinee which means to
help the Woolloomooloo Day Nursery to
hand-feed and fence in the young child while
its mother earns the daily crust. The Palace
Tneatre will be the place, and September 7
the time. The Day Nursery, which stands
between the infant head and stone doorsteps
while the mother mangles and does other
things at a daily wage, is a guardian of the
peace, and ought to be kept in work. At a
Day Nursery —not in Woolloomooloo—l
once examined the bumps of a morsel of
humanity which had inadvertently fallen
out of bed, where it had been gaoled while
its mother was clear-starching in the next
street. After that narrow escape from
death the Day Nursery gathered it in, and
applied kisses and other ointments to its
bruised feelings.
Miss Nell Cocks, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Arthur Cocks, of Neutral Bay, is going
to wear orange blossoms on Saturday. The
girl’s bridal plumage will also include a
shimmer of ivory satin, with a twinkle of
crystal and pearl embroidery over its tunic
drapery. The bridesmaidens, Misses Amie
Hudson, Jessie Lonsdale, and Doris Tar-
rett, are going to charm the male eye in a
froth of white muslin with pink sashes; and
putty-colored hats will trail sweetpeas and
other herbage round their brims. “Putty,”
I may mention, is only equalled by “hay,”
“sand,” and “mud,” as the last gasp ’in
fashionable color. Stanley Willmott will be
supported in his pilgrimage bv groomsmen
Eric Birks, Jack Willmott, and Keith Barra-
clough.
Mr. George Wentworth, youngest son of
Mr. Fitzwilliam Wentworth, and grandson
of “Australia’s patriot,” W. C. Wentworth,
of Vaucluse (Sydney), was married at St.
John’s Church, Toorak (Victoria), on
August 5, to Frances, youngest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. R. M. Morris, of Dalby (Q.).
Irene Browne, the buxom Martha who
wags her finger nightly at Louis XI. on Iler
Majesty’s stage, gets the only female sparkle
out of a man-acted play. Louis, by the way,
dies hard in handsome drapery of pale blu-
ish-green, with a bit of embroidered petti-
coat creeping round his feet. Eric Maxon.
as Nemours, is the dashing kind of lover who
flings furniture about, and takes no back
answers from kings, courtiers or such. In
the mediaeval millinery which consisted of
rattling armor like heavy soup-tureens, well-
jointed at the knees, Maxon looks bold enough
to carry off half a dozen damsels. A red
plush cloak dangles over his white-metal
back at 9 o’clock every evening except Sun-
days.
Somebody once remarked that few Aus-
tralian artists cared much about marine
things, excepting fried for supper. Seaweed,
sails, etc., haven’t hitherto occupied a large
acreage in local picture shows. Charles
Bryant is, however, attending to Davy Jones’s
locker on the other side of the globe, and is
mentioned at seafaring places on Britain’s
coast. Bryant’s Academy picture, “Landing
Fish at St. Ives,” and other marine efforts
are going to keep this Australian artist’s
end up in fish and seaweed circles.
Comedian Percy has a bright little daugh-
ter, who is “grown up” sufficiently to be
taken to the Roslyn Gardens Kindergarten,
where she absorbs Froebel and other light-
hearted aids to learning.
Mount Adelaide, one of the first houses
built at Darling Point, is being demolished.
It was put up over 60 years ago by one of
Sydney’s big early-day merchants, John
Croft, of Smith, Croft and Co., and was sub-
sequently occupied by Henry Mort for many
years. Another old mansion going down is
Maida House, on Balmain-road, an earlv
home of William Russell, the old-time solici-
tor. Callan Park, as a homestead, belonged
to the family of J. Ryan Brenan, who was
coroner in the days of the Ivnatehbull
murder sensation.
The Mater Misericordise Home at Waver-
ley is grappling with the evergreen hand-
maiden topic, by half-soling the middle-aged
domestic whose work sits like several tons
of bricks on her broken nerves. The mere
housewife can now collect her ideas, and
consider the hired help with a different
corner of her brain. The Help doesn’t al-
ways vanish into matrimony or shop coun-
ters ; occasionally she’s too tired to do any-
thing but move off the earth. The Llandaff-
street Home tries to catch her in time and
improve her with a rest cure. It also
teaches the younger domestics how to grill
a chop and gloss a linen collar. It works
by faith, but pays the butcher in coin of the
Commonwealth, and will get better results
if it gets more help.
Mrs. J. H. Phipps and Mrs. A. Cambage
are lion, treasurers in search of funds for
the North Sydney Women’s and Children’s
Hospital. lii conspiracy with Mrs. P.
Leahy and others, they are arranging a ball
to push more cash into the hospital treasury.
September 5 will be the time, and Warrin-
gah Hall (Neutral Bay) the place.
Melanesian Missionary Bishop Wilson and
his missus are passing through this city, on
the wing for S’Australia.
Henry Noel Brailsford’s “Adventures in
Prose” —short and chippy essays on every-
thing from Chopin to Osman Digma—have a
breeze in every leaf. “On Cats” will appeal
to suburban spinsters :
Kant saw sublimity in the starry heavens and
the moral law. He omitted to mention the common
cat... . There is one, an habitue of the square garden
in front of my house, which even comes to my ca 11...
She has never had from me so much as a saucer of
milk, and I have wisely refrained from admitting
her under my roof. We preserve, in consequence,-a
certain mutual esteem. . . .and, wearied of the humili-
ations to which my own cats subject me, I gladlv
seek her society.
The National Council of Women threatens
this town with a three-days’ meeting. “The
United Conference of Women Workers” will
scratch the face of argument on August 23,
24 and 25, surrounded by the chaste white-
wash of the Y.W.C.A. Hall. They’re going
to break it up in heats; Lady King-Ilall
presides over one, the Lieut.-Gov.’s dame
over another. And there's to be a time-
limit to everything. Mrs. F. Anderson will
be given lOmin. to trot out her Kindergarten
hobby. Grace Burrows will be presented
with a brick if she takes more than five
minutes to discuss the Girls’ Realm Guild.
Mrs. Izett will step down after five minutes’
Child Study observation. Miss Meager will
be condemned to go away and convert Dar-
ling Point and other Sabbath bridge-players
if she spends more than ten minutes explain-
ing why the Young Women’s Christian Asso-
ciations won’t wear hairpads. Mrs. Langer
Owen —a graceful speaker—will be relent-
lessly rung off in five minutes. Matron
McLeod will be cut off with a farthing sub-
scription if she runs to six minutes with her
remarks re the Crown-street Women's Hos-
pital. Some genius who condenses gas into
small nomexplosive solids has evidently been
helping, with the details of this corroboree.
Kosciusko reports umbrellas for the sun
and toboggans for the snow. Captain Ber-
nard Head has been spreading his Norwe-
gian experience over Australia’s white hat,
as referee in ski sports. And Captain
Dumaresq, off the vice-regal chain for a
few laps, has shown the novice how to cross
frost-bitten parts on skis like a chamois
shod with wings.
Yours, with a broad nib,
V ANDORIAN.
Old Simon the Yellower, speaking as a
delegate at the recent Norwich Festival of
Sheepbreeders, assured the assembled Brit-
ishers and others that, though the Yankee
Meat Trust might control the beef and mut-
ton consumption of all the rest of the world,
it “would never succeed in Australia.” Now,
why? It can’t be because Australia has a
“Liberal” political party, because every
other country in the world has that sort of
Private Enterprise machine. So it can only
be because Australia has a Labor party
strong enough to hold the Government.
Which, shows that Simon Fraser has more
faith in the Commonwealth Labor party
than he professes.
Burgoyne, M.P., the political Methuselah
of S.A., is 85 years old ; yet he is very regu-
lar in his attendance in Parliament, and
speaks as well as ever. He recently broke
his leg, but. is now all right again, and he
intends to fight the next election in his dis-
trict —one of the biggest in Australia —if
there should be a dissolution. Burgoyne
took a prominent part in political affairs in
1556, when the S.A. Constitution was being
framed, and ne was then on what was con-
sidered the Radical side. He was Works
Minister, under Cockburn 21 years ago. The
S.A. Legislative Council has also a veteran in
John Warren, aged 82, who either got his
politics out of the Ark or picked them up
from Mount Ararat after the Flood waters
had subsided. He has never broadened an
inch since he was first elected to Parliament
2o years aao, when his views had already
tossilised. He holds big areas of sheep coun-
trv in Central Australia, and is as hard as
nails.

“ BEN NO AND SOME OF THE PUSH. ,f
By EDWARD DYSON, author of “ The Missing Link,” etc.
WITH 16 ILLUSTRATIONS BY NORMAN LINDSAY.
PRICE 1/= ; Postage Id.
Some vears ago Mr. Dyson electrified Australia by liis “Fact ry
’Amis.” a 'book describing the sordid, tense life of the unfortunates
doomed to slave in certain factories. In “Benno we are again
introduced to some of the old characters, but tins time under
much improved conditions. There are more opportunities foi
•jocularity; the fun, though sometimes fast and furious, is good
humored, and most of the members of the push are worthy ot the
prominence given them. “Benno” himself is a study m -
class braggadocio that would be hard to beat, and some of the
“tones,” as “Benno” calls them, would wreck the seriousness of a
sphinx’. Bright, sparkling comedy, with a laugh in every line.

MUSIC ROLL.
The Most Lasting Entertainment
of all is to be found in the
Pianola Piano.
THE enjoyment and recreation which anyone can obtain from the Pianola
Piano last for all one's life. And as time goes on the keener becomes
one's sense of the pleasure which the Pianola Piano affords.
Is it not more advisable to invest in a Pianola Piano, and experience
throughout your life the ever-increasing fascination of personally producing
music, rather than to lose the certainty of this fascination in the pursuit of
entertainments which are but fleeting, and do not always entertain?
The Pianola is the only means of playing the piano other than by hand
which enjoys the support and co-operation of the world's greatest musicians.
The Pianola can be obtained at Pianola Hall in but two pianos, the
vSTEINWAY and STECR.
These two are pianos of international reputation. So great is the esteem
in which they are held all the world over that factories are necessitated in
both the Old World and the New. Of no other pianos can this be said.
The GENUINE Pianola Piano can be purchased from HO Guineas.
We allow the utmost value for ordinary Pianos, and extend the payment
of balance over one, two or three years.
You are invited to call at Pianola Hall and play your favorite music.
Even if you cannot play by hand you will find that you can play well at
once on the Pianola Piano.
Full particulars will be sent if you write for Catalogue C.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 14, 1911.
My Dear Yakrie,—
G.-G. Denman’s pilot, ' Chamberlain Vic-
tor Hood, who has gone wrong in the nerves,
is to proceed to England for a rest cure as
soon as travelling is possible. With many
Government House men that would mean
good-bye for ever,- but as , the Hon. Victor
has spent 17 years (with interludes), in Aus-
tralia, and is a fervent sun worshipper, we
will probably see him again.
She hadn’t been long in Melbourne before
her Excellency Denman, accompanied by
Cady Barttelot and Miss . Quirk, and squired
by Captain Stewart Richardson and Private
Sec. R. V. Vernon, cut ice at the “Glassy.”
The vice-regal lady was tight-fitted in thick
yelvet, and, with Ice-professor Langley as
4 waltzing partner, skimmed the frozen
floor like a swallow. Miss Quirk Waltzed
and did the inner and outer edges. Stewart
Richardson, lean and long, took the ice
with the' .Professor as a support, while the
Private. Sec. rinked with glorious abandon —
first on his heels, then on all fours: The
Maddens, McKinnons, Moffatts and others
lent their moral and other support, the band
played “Of course, you can never be like
us,” and the tea and cakecafe did a roaring
trade.
The Orvieto last Wednesday steamed down*
the Bav with ex-G.-G. Dudley aboard. Suc-
cessor Denman, accompanied by the big
Grenadier and the bear furnishings, went
down to the wharf.; State Excellency Ful-
ler land a batch of military and naval men
also attended. Politicians Frazer, Findley,
Deakin and Best were -on hand for a final
shake; but the Acting-Prime Minister was
“unavoidably detained.”
Melba arrived on Sunday morning by the
Adelaide express; so did Prime Minister
Fisher.; The result of the two stars taking
their calL. at the same moment was confu-
sion. At quite an early hour purring motors
commenced to rush from all quarters through
the sleepy city, and whir towards Spencer-
street. After a while the station yard was
full of.chattering people. The steam caravan
at last trailed wearily in through the maze
of tracks; a handkerchief fluttered at a
window; and a band of flower-laden women
charged, regardless of expense and possible
breakages.
Melba, looking well and happy in a blue
serge travelling dress, under a cone-shaped
hat, decked with high, black plumes, was so
effusively welcomed that she could not move
an elbow, ' and had to cling desperately to
her armful of presentation vegetables. At
last, by’ hard work and much diplomacy, a
way was' made through the crush, and she
was enabled to get her foot on the step of the
Lemprieres’ motor. ’ Mrs. Peterson, with her
women choristers cheering instead of singing,
led the first attack on the train. Melba’s
floral bundle consisted principally of prim-
roses, violets and wattle. The eager. crowd
accidentally brushed some of them away.
“Pick up my flowers!” said the autocratic
nrima-donna to the nearest worshipper.
They were immediately grovelled for. Mana-
ger Lemmone, looking brown, fit and busy,
was with the star. The other artists are
coming hither in the following boat—the
Mooltan.
Hater in the day a family party motored
off to Lilvdale “to see Dad.” The little
town, which was wearing its new green Spring
costume, was trimmed with flags and bunt-
ing for the welcome-home; the shire presi-
dent made a speech, and the town band,
which had practised till the birds of the air
protested, played adverse of “Home, Sweet
1 tome” while the stationary motor shed oily
fears and sighed deep gasoline sighs.
Madame, in reply, said that she had travelled
north, east and west, and had come to the
conclusion that there, was no place like the
old place. Then the motor shook itself and
moved on.
Fisher, P.C., had his share of cheering at
the other end of the train after the Parlia-
mentarians and 'friends had contended with
the Melba crowd. “Where’s Melba?” cried
one elbowing lot. “Where’s Fisher?” de-
manded the other, shoving desperately. Cap-
tain Stewart-Richardson- represented the
G.-G., and, though he had an advantage of
several inches over the majority, managed
to get mixed up in the crush. He hurried,
first of all, to the Melba storm-centre, and
had to push his way out again. When at
last he sighted the missing Prime Minister,
he smiled with relief. Fisher, whilst being
interviewed and welcomed, grasped a little
posy composed of violets, snowdrops and
mignonette in one hand. Mrs. Fisher, for
whom it was doubtless intended, is coming
on later in the week; but she wasn’t there
to receive it, and the Privy Councillor was
burthened with the unsuitable gift. His
secretary and two boys were in the motor
when he managed to escape from the hawk-
like photographers. A number of lost
people were wandering about after both
notabilities had departed and the Sabbath
silence of Melbourne had again enveloped the
city.
Melba brings five Italian maids as well as
a butler and “shover” with her. Apparently
Italian is the language she _is studying at the
moment. For a long time in London she sur-
rounded herself with French servants in order
to familiar,se herself with the language.
State Governor Fuller’s establishment has
developed a bad attack of mustard-colored
motor. No less than four petrol waggons
pant round Stonington and wait to be un-
leashed on the public highways. Malvern
may now be said to be the headquarters of
the Yellow Peril.
Caulfield, on Saturday, was mostly a con-
fab, under umbrellas. The lawn, which would
have been a blaze of new Spring millinerv
had the weather shown a disposition to
smile, was given over to the men who, by
virtue of their thick soles, are enabled to
•stand where their lightly-shod angel-wives
tear to tread. The women huddled together
in the stands, and the fur-clad among them
snuggled contentedly and rejoiced secretly
that the season had gone back on the cats
who tried to drag Spring in with light
fabrics.
The Denmans went out early with a large
party, and lunched with the stewards. Her
Ex. was garbed smartly in a,pale grey coat
and a skirt cut short, with a grey cloak
thrown togft-fashion over her shoulder. She
saw the Australian Steeplechase run, then
left for home in the rain, attended by a
gentleman-help. Sub-Governor Fuller and
his lady had intended to go to Buffalo.
When the deluge arrived and made the
mountain trip an impossibility, his Ex., like
a good sport, motored out to the course and
finished the gloomy day happily.
The’ Denman suite are an imposing collec-
tion. Miss Quirk wore a close-fitting dress
of green velvet. Lady Barttelot looked a
slight little figure in a putty-colored costume,
under a big, round hat covered with violets.
The South Australians came over in
squadrons to see Concave win. Squatter
Bowman, who owns the victorious animal, is
counted a shrewd man. “Perhaps he’ll wait
a year before putting anything in; bht he
always brings a dead-sure tiling,” said a
racing, man thoughtfully before tile ’Chase.
The Tolleys were over and the Whitmore
Carrs. Mrs. Davis, cosily gowned in green
and sable, came along with her husband ;
and of course the Mount Schank Clarkes
were on hand. They _ attend every South
Australian meeting of importance, and, now
that the girls are out, come across to Mel-
bourne and; Sydney for the big events. The
two smart damsels sport different dresses
levery time they appear. On Saturday one
sister wore Dutch blue and white. A smart
black hat, fitted with white rabbit ears, set
at an acute angle, finished the costume. The
other,, Roma, wore pepper-and-salt tweed
and a tall hat trimmed with cherry-colored
tulle.
The rest of the fashionable crowd were
obscured by umbrellas and macintoshes.
The latest species of “mac” is horribly ex-
pensive _ and fearfully ugly. It is made of
thin, oiled silk, and is quite transparent.
That is right enough; but, unfortunately,
Mrs. Fashion won’t allow them to be color-
less. They are mostly made in bright yellow
and purple, and they reflect on to the
wearer’s face with unflattering results. I
imagine a rose-pink coat would be an aid to
the complexion instead of a handicap.
• Le Soeuf, director of the Melbourne Zoo, is
contemplating a collecting trip to Bechuana-
land next year, and the redoubtable Norton
Grimwade-is thinking of going along with
him, and making a hunting trip of it. Whilst
the zoologist is caging wild beasts in one
place, Grimwade will be shooting at them
hard by.
Tenor Walter Kirby is still moving about
Melbourne, and is living in a sort of osten-
tatious seclusion. Occasionally he sings,
but chiefly lie muses on his friendships with
the Great. Walter, it is said, was much
petted by one or two members of the Eng-
lish Royal Family. The late Edward was
understood to be a friend and admirer, and
5 once at least had the tenor to lunch. The
'Story runs that Walter’s poor appetite occa-
sioned some royal remark. Indeed at one
stage Edward was moved to say: “Here,
Kirby, my boy, you are not eating your
chop.” Whereupon the tenor awoke from his
dream of Art, or whatever it was, and, put-
ting his hand to his brow, murmured, “How
easily one forgets one’s food!” So, at least,
the story goes.
The Alliance Franqaise put on its very
best chiffons on Thurday night, in the fond
hope of meeting Lady Fuller; but the lady
was too ill to venture out. The Consul also
had to stay at home through sickness. The
despairful gathering thereupon fell back on
John Madden—but not on his foot. Fortu-
nately gout in a mild form does not disable,
and he was on hand ready to limp gallantly
into the breach. Music was provided for the
first part of the programme ; then the audi-
ence was refreshed with coffee before the
French play was turned on. Mr. Yander-
kelen, who owns a fine, resonant voice, took
the part of an artist who is painting the
portraits of a family of noveaux riches;
Mrs. Gay, in a grey wig, was a retired
tradesman’s wife ;• and Miss Dubief, in the
daintiest of aprons, made a rather startled
parlor-maid.
Before the Sheffield Choir arrived in Mel-

On the departure of the singing company,
it was discovered that there was £2O left

Talking of receptions to the Choir, has
anyone looked for the true inwardness of
the cold civic shoulder that was served to
Dr. Harriss and the Sheffielders in Ade-
laide? It was Mayor Cohen who gave in-
structions that no receptions were to be
offered to people coming to the city “for
gain” ; and it was Mayor Cohen whose ap-
plication to be made a Lord Mayor was so
coldly turned down by the Colonial Office.
It may, of course, have been coincidence ; but
it also may have been that Cohen, having got
some “Imperial” cold-shoulder himself, saw
and grabbed a chance to give some “Im-
perial” trumpeters a cut from the same
joint.

The Catholic Ladies’ College ball is al-
ways a brilliant affair, and this year it came
near to outshining the glittering City News-
boys’ ball. ; The're were some’ gorgeous , and
original fancy sets, and, in addition, some of
the Newsboys’ novelties made a second ap-
pearance. Mrs. St. Leger had a smart mili-
tary set and Mrs. Dalton a line collection of
large and lovely butterflies. Mrs. levers
managed a batch of Juliets with attendant
Romeos. A Winter set sweltered in swans-
down, but cheered up when someone admired
the effect of the scarlet berries on the warm
wrappings. Ex-mayoress Wqedon, who is a
specially-interested patron of the C.L.C.
Club, was in white satin and gauze, with a
top-dressing of rose point lace; Mayoress
Davey garbed in white satin; and Amy
Castles floated round in a tunic and satin
skirt of pale blue. Mrs. Maurice MacGilli-
cuddy and Mrs. McCrystal secretaried the
affair, and helped to make a big success of
it.
Amy Murphy, the Maoriland songstress,
gets a chance with Clarke and Meynell’s
Opera Company in “The Chocolate Soldier,”
which shoulders arms at Melbourne on Sep-
tember 2. It is the first real opportunity
Miss Murphy has been given in opera to show
her quality, “Blue Moon” and such-like being
more slopera than opera, and those who are
best acquainted with the lady’s voice are
easy in their mind as to the resulj:.
An opera called “A Daughter of Italy,”
written and composed by Arthur Chanter,
was performed at the Sandringham Hall
t’other Saturday under difficulties. A young
woman called Laura, who had been scorned
and was furious about it, tracked her faith-
less lover through a pink-paper forest, where
he was supposed to be concealed. As a mat-
ter of fact, he was frequently in full view of
the audience. When not engaged in actively
pursuing him, the leading lady sang wild
threats of vengeance to a group of workless
but intensely sympathetic peasants, who
were invariably seized with St. Vitus’s dance
at the conclusion of her remarks. There
were a few graceful, numbers for the princi-
pals ; but the show was handicapped, and all
but scratched, by the absence of proper
scenery, and the company’s lack of stage
“business.” The pCrformmce wouldn’t have
been convincing even if every person present
had been supplied with a sworn declaration
and a photograph of the J.P. it was sworn
before. Justice having been defeated with
the aid of a silver-paper dagger, and the sui-
cide having rolled out of the way of the
descending curtain, the witnesses of the show
were discharged without a stain on their
characters, and went home pondering on the
pluck of the composer who produces . his
opera in a suburban hall on a windy cliff-
side.
A rich Scotchbyterian who recently died,
neglected to make an equal cut of his pro-
perty between his two daughters. Sympa-
pathy is felt for both—especially the one to
whom the worldly goods were left in one
heap. It must be embarrassing to be given
all, and be ever afterwards pointed at re-
proachfully as the favored one. An intoler-
able position for a generous nature to be
placed in. Still, it has its compensations;
and, after all, one can easily escape from it.
Said that a stage beauty with a widely adver-
tised face, who vvas going Britainwards with
a girl chum, failed to reach her destination

It dropped her at Colombo, or she went

left, and an anxious inquirer is just now
awaiting her in London.

Miss “Como” Armytage is mending nicely.
Whilst escorting the architect up the tower
to point certain repairs which would be re-
quired, the lady slipped and fell down the
stairs. She just missed taking a header
through the window. The architect, plenti-
fully smeared with the lady’s blood, fled
doctor-wards after sending the domestic staff
to render first aid ; and the doctor insisted
upon seeing to the architect’s supposed
wounds before flying post-haste to Como.
Eileen Smith, who used to be given to elo-
cution and amateur theatricals, has sailed to
the South Seas with her lately-annexed hus-
band, planter Nicholls, of Fiji. The wedding-
party was reinforced by the L. L. Smiths,
who, despite the name, are not relations, but
old friends. Louise Smith played bridesmaid

Nellie Stewart and Harcourt Beattie are

A shire that is pinned to the edge of Mel-
bourne is in a social bubbub. A while ago
the president of the parish was tendered a
ball by the local gentility, and his wife was
handed some pieces of plate. Mrs. Presi-
dent, however, possibly suspecting that the
goods were far below her deserts, defied all
social precedent by returning the glittering
gift. The donors are naturally exasperated,
and at present feel like boiling her down
with the plate to see what sort of amalgam
they can get.
The old custom of seeing snakes has been
greatly improved upon by a young Maori-
lander now in these parts. After a convivial
night with other spiritists, he took to heav-
ing the. hotel crockery at fairies, who, he
said, were blowing poisonous gases beneath
the doors: He was remanded for a week
for medical observation. While the Gas Co.
keeps on charging, for its vapor at the pre-
sent rate, the man who hurls crockery at
gratis gas must be viewed with suspicion.
Artist Will Longstaff, who dabbles in agri-
culture, and once swapped a toothless "old
horse for an able-bodied young cow, has been

a critical eye over some countryside he owns.
Writes my Adelaide correspondent:—
Acting-Mayor Ronython’s term of office ended
with the return of the Cohens, and on Friday after-
noon he was handed the inevitable address. Chief-
Justice Way (who is holding the reins while the
Bosanquets feast in Brisbane) handed him the docu-
ment, along with some plated-ware for his sister,
Mrs. H. A. Parsons, who has been acting-Mayoress.
Our rightful Mayor, bv the way, has arrived back
from the Coronation an embittered man. He ex-
pected to return either a Lord Mayor or a knight,
or both —he remains plain Cohen. He puts the
entire blame for the outrage. on Prime Minister
Fisher, and is now more than ever satisfied that
Labor is a dangerous Tiger, and a Menace to
Society.
The Willunga railway project seems ill-starred.
Following on the upsetting of the poll a couple of

A party of land-holders, intent on voting in this
referendum, left the city per motor char-a-banc. In
negotiating one of the hills an axle snapped, sent
the car off the road, and pinioned Mrs. H. de N.
Lucas, killing her instantly. The Lucases are an
old Adelaide family; and Mrs. H. Lucas was for
many years a teacher at the .North Adelaide School.
The new Hunt president (Mr. W. Pope) seems
bent on doing things well. The ball which he and
his wife gave on Wednesday was mainly in honor of
the club. A marquee on the lawn gave space for
dancing, and left the rest of the house free. The
coats of the members made' a vivid ■ splash of color,
and the note was echoed in the decoration scheme
of both ball and supper rooms. Mount House is ,one
of the show residences of North Adelaide, where Mrs.
Pope indulges her hobbies of fowls and roses.
We . have been enduring a heat wave, which has
wilted suburban gardens, and made that important
S. Australian person, the farmer, wonder whether
he was quite wise to run .into debt for that last
motor-car. Despite the unseasonable weather-record,
football has been raging—inter-State fixtures mainly
—and great crowds have gathered even at the busiest
time of the day to yell curses and encouragements.
Miss de Lissa, who has successfully nursed our
kindergarten system through its infancy, left by the
Orvieto for Westralia, where she has been invited
to do a month’s campaigning in an effort to estab-
lish a Free Kindergarten Union, on lines similar to
ours.
Picture shows make no sign of decreasing popu-
larity ; all the “theatres” (which means anything
from the Town Hall to a tent) are packed nightly.
Plans are under way for the erection of a
specially-designed picture theatre in Ifindley-street,
which will move briskly towards completion once
a definite start is made. Rumor says that if that is
a success, others will follow. Also, Jackman’s arc
in their new quarters, and Ad£laide may have
supper now up till 11.30 p.m. This city is going the
pace.
We have added another to the list of our honors
won “abroad.” Miss Marie Tuck, a S. Australian
who is studying in Paris, has received honorable
mention for a picture hung on the line at the Salon
of the Artistes Franeaises. Miss Tuck is the first
woman from this State to win the distinction.
Departed from us this week, Miss M. Grant Bruce,
who has spent some time in JS. Australia. Her book,
“A Little Bush Maid,” has had a big sale, and
Ward, Lock and Co. have more of her work in
hand.
On Friday the ex-Governor General paid us a fly-
ing visit ; on his way to England. Officialdom met
and personally conducted him to Government House,
where he talked to the Deputy Governor, and thence
to the Adelaide Club, where he lunched before re-
turning to the boat. The station was cheerfully
adorned with the usual flags and pot plants and
cheers. Other passers-through were Prime Minister
Fisher and Madame Melba. They came—and went —
on Saturday.
Sincerely yours,

Angas Johnson, an Adelaide pathologist of
repute, has received from an old friend at
the museum of the British Medical Associa-
tion two alleged pieces of the aorta of the
Pharaoh who would not let the Israelites
leave Egypt, and who was much badgered
by Moses and Aaron in consequence. Micro-
scopic examination shows that Pharaoh suf-
fered from syphilis, a gouty kidney and
Bright’s disease. His mummy, it is re-
corded, also showed that he suffered from bad
teeth. Under these conditions, it is not
wonderful that he didn’t feel too bright, and
said he'd be wbat’s-his-named before he went
cruising around to find straw for the Jews
to put in their bricks. Dr. Johnson intends
to let the medical congress in Sydney have a
look at the bits of Pharaoh.

The Brandy of Health
APART from its medicinal value,
Chateau Tanunda Brandy is dis-
tinguished by a full, round and
mellow flavor —due to its age. Every
bottle contains a spirit distilled from the
choicest Australian grapes, grown in the
heart of the great South Australian vine-
yards. Matured by the only natural pro-
cess of Time —aged in casks and blended
with fine old 20-year Brandy, stocked
especially for blending, AND IN ONE
QUALITY ONLY. This method guar-
antees the unique quality of the brandy and
its consistent strength, flavor and bouquet


NOTE. —For those who prefer the liquid
preparation, chemists are still dispensing
the famous prescription as follows: One
ounce/of fluid Extract, of Glycprrhisa 8.P.,
ohp.: ounce''of pure Glyokrihe 8.P., one half-
irmuw-nyf Mar mold, and /mix with pepper-
mint water to make six ounces' in all. The

THE BIG THING
IN RHEUMATISM
' ~v
Is Finding a Cure that's Permaneiit.
This woman found a cure that,
drove the complaint from
her system.
The big thing in Rheumatism is of, course
a cure that is permanent. Rheumatic suf-
ferers, witu the tender, swollen joints and stiff
muscles, get sick and tired of trying so many
things that at the best give relief hut for a
short time. They will be interested to know
that a great amount of success in perman-
ently curing Rheumatism has been achieved
through treatment with Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. The success of this treatment is based
on the conviction of a host of doctors that
Rheumatism is caused by acid in the blood.
The formation of new blood through Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, and the improved gen-
eral health found to result from their use,
enables the system to throw off the Rheu-
matic poison. Rheumatism can’t be cured
by rubbing things on, for the reason that
lubbing doesn’t drive the poison out of the
system. That is just where Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills succeed. They cured Mrs. Eliza-
beth Hope, of 171 Havelock Street, West
Perth, W.A., who made the following state-
ment to a reporter
“I contracted Rheumatism some years ago'
and used to suffer dreadfully,” - said Mrs.
Hope; “It first started in my knees and
gradually spread to every part of my body,
leaving one place and going to another.
Hardly a week at a time in ah those years
was I free from pain in one part or another.
My fingers would swell up, and some days
my arms would be so stiff I could barely
raise them above my head, and it was a
trouble to do my hair, or even put on : my
clothes. My knees and'ankles and the back of
my hands would puff up amazingly. For
months at a time I could not put on a boot,
but had to just wear si i oners. I would have
to stop at home as 1 could hardly,walk at
times, and then only very slowly. Some days
I could hardly get about the house. - Every
joint and muscle seemed painful and stiffened.
The skin would look shiny and red, arid 1
would try all kinds of liniments, but I would
merely get relief for a while. I would notice
every change of the weather. As soon as I
got settled in bed the attacks would
worse than ever. I would barely get two
hours’ rest all the night. I would lie there
afraid to move, and the bed-clothes would be
unbearably heavy. I had to wear flannels
on my arms night and day, for the least
breath of wind would affect me. I wpuld
often have to get help to do my house duties,
for I could not stoop or get about, freely.
At last I tried Dr. Williams’ Pink PillA tak-
ing three a day at first, and they, slowly
drove out all the rheumatic pains. Bit by
bit they disappeared, and my muscles: and
joints are now as supple as could be de-
sired.” . •

POLITICAL
POINTS
F. M. B. Fisher, M.11.R. (M.L.), the
leaseholder in the Massey freehold party, has
done it again. Talking in support of the
Massey candidate at Hastings (the squat-
ters’ district), he casually remarked that
what the cockies wanted was a “good stiff
land tax —promptly applied.” Massey is now
busily explaining that it was said only in
fun.

HE: “ You never seem to want to spend a quiet
evening at home as you used to before we

SHE: “My dear boy! I never waste time
chasing a thing I’ve already caught.”
f Ex-Justice Hartley Williams, after compar-
ting England with Australia, is rudely
in the Argus for his shockingly d.s-
loyal - conduct in saying things that might
. lead Little Australians into the wicked habit
I of thinking there are hungry men and women
and wet weather in John Bull’s run. But
did anyone ever notice the Argus abusing
anyone for imparting the aroma of dead-fish
to Australia’s reputation? It is a natural
outcome of the kind of bastard Imperial
loyalty fostered by the Argus, that an Aus-
tralian cannot warmly praise Australia with-
out exciting the gravest suspicion.
THE MUDDIED ANTHEM.

'■■■ ■ ... .—Typical N.S.W. electioneering items.
The knowledgable “Liberal”
Is not perturbed when people fling
The Brick of Ridicule at him ;
He robs such missiles of their sting
By calling on the enemy
To rise-and shout “God Save the King!”
The halting phrase, the futile jest,
7 That yawns and grief and boredom bring ;
The dull and ancient platitude
! Which sets attention wandering,
All bolt for cover, as it were,
’Neath that stout shield, “God Save the King.”
The splurging “Empire” imbecile
Who finds himself amid a ring
Of ribald scoffers, answers jeers,
Corrections, insults,', everything
(Or so he thinks) when he defies
Ilis foes to' chant “God Save the King.”
Each new reactionary cry—
; State Rights and Dreadnought-purchasing,
Closed Ports, Cow Slaves and Anti-Sosh —-
Has caused the country’s ears to ring
With that irrelevant refrain
Which people call “God Save the King.”
It is the refuge of the ass.
’Tis used to buttress grovelling
: And cant and lies and foolishness
sAt every “Liberal” gathering:
To such base uses is it put—
Old England’s hymn, “God Save the King.”

THE SLIM WOMAN’S TRIUMPH.
: The day of the slim woman’s triumph has
arrived. “The thinner one is the more styl-
ish,” says the dressmakers.
This would have been sad news for the fat
woman. a year ago. She would have had to
try f dieting or exercise. Nowadays, however,
the woman who is too fat for the fashionable
styles goes to a chemist and gets a bottle of
Marmola Prescription Tablets, one of which
she "j takes after each meal and at bedtime,
and* so reduces her superfluous flesh quickly.
These tablets, being made in accordance
with the famous Marmola prescription, and
ta,ken according to directions, are harmless,
a nth'they cost only Bs. 6d. a bottle, one of
which is frequently enough to start a person
lbsing fat at the rate of 12 or 14 ounces a
day. flliey are sold by all chemists at 3s. 6d,

The Maoriland Government has been
obliged to start its threatened prosecution of
youngsters for failure to enrol under the De-
fence Act. At a’case heard in Nelson re-
cently it turned out that the boy was willing
but the father objected ; and, as the father
went on objecting, the lad was fined £5. The
father has now sent the boy away from
“God’s own country” to a place where there
is more “freedom.” All the ’■ while the
“anti-military” crowd is shrieking encour-
agement to the rebels at. the top of its
voice, and it seems about time to talk seri-
ously to these disturbers- of the peace. A
few years ago Sleath and Ferguson and a
few other people spent a year or two in gaol
for “conspiracy in restraint of trade, and a
conspiracy to restrain trade is a small
matter compared with a conspiracy to pre-
vent national safety.
Sixteen York-street (Sydney) merchants,
who lease premises thereabouts; 10 lease-
hold tenants of a big estate at Alexandria;
30 leaseholders of .another big estate at Neu-
tral Bay; several stockbrokers who occupy
rented chambers ; Tom ’Enley, and a number
of newspaper correspondents agreed unani-
mously in Sydney recently that a burning
nay, a roasting —injustice was being perpe-
trated by the N.S.W. Labor party in
not allowing every man in the community to
exercise his “inalienable British right” to the
ownership of his land. As a matter of cold
fact, the “inalienable British right” doesn t
exist. The law of N.S.W., copied from Feu-
dalism, says that there is only one owner ot
the land, the King (which here means the
State), and that he, as Lord Paramount
and sole owner, can only allow “estates” in
land, some longer, some shorter, some for a
life, others for a succession of lives, some to
a man and his heirs; but all of them limited,
and not absolute; all of them feudal, and
none ’of them allodial or complete.
Maoriland Farmers’ Union, which has
hitherto gammoned to be non-political, but
lias always kept a good crop of Tory princi-
ples about the premises, has at last mustered
them and turned them into the political
market. During the campaign prior to the
November poll all candidates will be tested
on the following five main points:—
(1) That Crown tenants have the option of buying
at the original valuation.
(2) That ratepayers Only be-allowed to vote in
counties and rural districts.
(3) That no more land tax or Protective duty be
imposed. '
(4) Public works to be constructed on tender
system only.
(5) Socialistic legislation to be strenuously re-
sisted.
The Farmers’ Union contains a good sprink-
ling of rich landlords who let out farms to
leaner men; and if it’s a good thing to coin-
pel the State to sell the freehold at the origi-
nal valuation to its tenants, what’s wrong
about compelling these Fat “farmers” to also
sell their farms to f/teir tenants at the price
the land was worth when those tenants first
arrived on the premises?
Owing to the dread of Irish blight in
Westralia, the importation of potatoes has
practically ceased, and that and Private En-
terprise’s little tricks bumped the price in
Perth to be-
tween £4O and
£5O a ton. At
tn a t altitude
the Government
stepped in and
undertook to es-
tablish depots in
Perth and Fre-
mantle, where
potatoes will be
received from
other States,
peeled under of-
ficial s u p er-
vision, and sold
to the public
minus their
jackets at £ll

more Socialism
is exposed in its
true colors, and
its dreadful con-
sequences laid

mists have de-

must be a tiger.
The father of the Ma State’s Legislative
Council is George Lee, who was appointed
by Parkes away back in 1881. His “runner-
up” is 11. C. Dangar, appointed by Alex-
ander Stuart in 1883. Mr. Dangar had
represented West Sydney from 1874 to 1880,
and East Sydney in one Parliament after-
wards ; but Mr. Lee had had no political ex-
perience at all. He tried once for Bathurst,
and was beaten, and, presumably, it was
because the country thought he wasn’t good
enough to be trusted to legislate? for three
years that old-man Parkes put him where he
could legislate for 30 years. IBs. father.

The same game is being played in the
West as in the East—the “Liberal” women
are being put up to do the electioneering
jobs that the “Liberal” men are ashamed to
tackle. Sometimes it is to repeat the
ancient and exploded perjuries; more often,
nowadays, it is to cadge coin. \ Thus an
appeal has just been made by the “Aus-
tralian Women’s National Leagrfe,” signed
by the Premier’s wife and the Acting Pre-
mier’s missus, and countersigned by “Jessie
A. Ackermann, State organiser.” It runs
this way:—
Dear Sir, —Because of the recent alarming and
high-handed attempt to force class legislation upon
the country, and in view of the coming elections, the
finance committee has decided to appeal to the
inasscs. ofi Liberal people to contribute a small sum
each to the campa-gn fund. We are asking Liberal
men and women everywhere to make all’possible sac-
rifice, if need be, and send a pound each by return
mail. A pound now is worth ten when it is too
late. Now is the time. Six seats may be recovered
if you help at once. We have the workers ready.
Send us a pound! Put everyone you know on the
roll. Do not flag one second. We need your help
in every* way. Send cheque or money order. Make
out cheques -to Women’s National League. Please
send without delay.- ».

Some of those people who think that Aus-
tralia can afford to go on snoring seem to
have a worse opinion of the Jap than those
who are shouting in Australia’s ear and tell-
ing it to wake up. Thus the redoubtable
Owen Smyth said when lecturing in Adelaide
the other day, that Australia need not
trouble about the Yellow Peril for a genera-
tion or two, because Japan is too busy
“stealing the trade of Western nations,”
among other things.

Acting Prime Minister Hughes, the incor-

the Protective duty on sugar (which else-
where is produced almost exclusively by
nigger labor), excuses the shocking idea on
the ground that hardly anybody benefits ex-

Hughes would, no doubt ? abolish policemen
if they were suspected ot only looking after
rich men’s lives and property; it wouldn't
occur to him to compel them to protect poor
men’s lives and property as well.
Said S. H. McGowan, president, at a meet-
ing of the Bendigo Agricultural Society’s
committee the other day
They had seen by recent happenings in the N. S.
AVales Parliament what a Labor Government would
do if it could. Every farmer should learn to look
after No. 1.
Just about that same moment the fruit-
growers of Bendigo and other Victorian
parts were wailing in the ear of the Govern-
ment that a fruit-sliipping ring was fatten-
ing at their expense. Under the circum-
stances, and assuming that they agreed with
president McGowan, they will no doubt stop
asking for the Government’s Socialistic help,
and apply the fine principle of self-reliance
to their present need. Either that, or they
will tell Mr. McGowan to go back to his
office stool and leave off being a political
parrot.
Dear Bulletin.— Please ring up for the
police and the ambulance. I’ve just got a
circular from the Liberal Women’s Literary
and Debating Club, and it asks for my sym-
pathy and aid “in making known the fact
that their club room is open as a Rest Room
for the business girls and women of Sydney,
who may be detained in the City for Educa-
tional and other purposes” on Wednesday
and Friday evenings. And the Liberal
Women tell me that if the response is satis-
factory the committee will open the rooms
on additional evenings. This comes, mind
you, from the ladies who have been yelling at
the Labor party about the bursting of the
marriage tie. Now they offer a rest room
for ladies who are detained in the city for
educational and other purposes. Help!
Police ! Yours broken-bear tedly, Neiiemiah
Numps. ■
Tasmania has completed arrangements
whereby its Federal and State electors —who
are identically the same persons—are en-
rolled in one act, by one set of officials, thus
saving a considerable handful of cash.
Westralia is following suit, and S. Australia
is willing. But, while the same rolls are to be
used for the State Assemblies and the House
of Reps., there isn’t the ghost of a chance
of the same rolls being used for the Senate
and the Houses of Fat Landlords. If that,
were done, there soon wouldn’t be any
Houses of Fat Landlords; and, if there were
no Houses of Fat Landlords, there wouldn’t
be anything worth having in State Frights.
Of course the fact is carefully disguised—
especially when a Labor person is within
sight—but it’s a fact nevertheless that State
Frights and Fat Landlords are practically
interchangeable terms.
Willie Watt has introduced to Vic. Assem-
bly an Amending Factories Act Bill, which
will cause trouble if it is passed. It pro-
vides that members of country Wages Boards
shall be bona fide employees or employers
in the trades affected. Watt hasn’t dared
apply this idea to the city Boards, as that
would mean capsizing so many bodies that
the system would probably break down ; but
there are not, unfortunately, many country
Boards —as yet. The idea is one that the
Fat Landlords have previously advocated;
for Fat naturally likes to see present-day
employees on such Boards, instead of union
secretaries, ex-employees, organisers and so
forth. Not, of course, because the fear of
losing their billets makes such em-
ployees less aggressive (Fat would shudder
at the idea), but because —well, Fat will
cheerfully offer a dozen plausible reasons.
To his credit, Premier Weary refused this
request a year ago, but locum tenens Watt
is out after votes, and is throwing Fat a
sprat. And Fat is a whale for sprats.
When Horne resigned the Liverpool Plains
(N.S.W.) Assembly seat and dropped the
State Labor party in a small hole, D. IL
Hall, the Federal member, offered to resign
liis seat in the Reps, if the party couldn’t
alight promptly on a satisfactory candidate.
But the sacrifice wasn’t called for; Ashford,
a substantial farmer, who isn’t scared of the
Labor party’s land policy, was at once forth-
coming.
The S. Aus. La-
bor Government Is
building houses in
country towns for
railway men and
other Government
employees, because
landlords have run
up rents so high.
The worker in pri-
vate employment
in town and city
is wondering Where
he comes in. Yet,
as a matter of
business, the
Verran G o v-
ernment does quite
right. If its em-
ployees are rack-
rented, they will
have to get higher
pay from the Gov-
ernment ; and the
higher pay will
benefit, not the
men, but the landlords. It is quite com-
petent for private employers to protect them-
selves in exactly the same way.
“Exile” writes from London: —
On official authority one can say with certainty
that the representative Australian Parliamentarians
now in London unitedly resolved that not one of
them would accept a title. Their resolution was
conveyed to Mr. Asquith tactfully, with the assurance
that there was no personal reason for the joint re-
fusal. In future, titles for Australians, either poli-
ticians or mayors, seem doomed. _ For which every
sensible Australian will rise to his feet and thank
every legislator now in London for the Coronation-
excepting- J. G. Ward, of Maoriland.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The V.A.T.C. meeting finished on Satur-
day, in more or less rotten weather. The big race,
the Steeple, brought out 11 starters, and five of them
failed to negotiate the course. Grafnax, Bribery
and Field Trial were all well-backed ; and all, with
a reputation for being as safe as crows across coun-
try, found the weights, or the pace, or the big tim-
ber too much for them, and the winner turned up
in the S’Australian gelding Concave. Leah Kleshna
was second, and the hurdle-racer Minato third. The
Ring wore an aspect of holy joy as the numbers went
up. “Twelves” was their starting price against
any one of the first three, which is another way of
remarking that the public had left them severely
alone.
This makes the fourth big jumping event taken
lately by S’Australian horses, Arquebuse having got
away previously with the G. National, Doutta Galla
and Australian Hurdles.
Bullawarra won the Arkaringa Hurdle Race, from
Elegy, whom the books made favorite ; Flaith, a 12
to 1 chance, snared the Malakoff Stakes; and Icicle
(sevens) romped away with the Knowsley Steeple-
chase. Altogether a bad day for backers and those
subject to rheumatism.
* * * *
Melbourne Cup this year falls on Novem-
ber 7, the latest date possible.
What a disastrous game steeplechasing is
may be seen from the record of the Australian
Steeplechase, in which five of Saturday’s 11 starters
fell. The distance was increased to four miles in
’B7, when Blue Mountain won, and only one fell.
That was the most sure-footed field. In the 24 years
since then there have been 331 starters altogether,
of whom but 175 finished —just about half. In
Busaco’s year (1891), but seven out of 18 starters
got home; in Airly’s (’O4), the same number;
last vear only three finished out of 15 that began.
But the most awful cropper was in ’97, when only
Britomarte and Zouroff covered the course safely
out of 11 that tackled it, though Montrose and Cer-
berus picked themselves up and struggled into third
and fourth places. As for the jockeys, the hospitals
and the coroners know what happened to them.

Every Slate was represented at the Aus-
tralian Football Council, which sat in Adelaide all
last week. The position was of the humorous kind,
known as Gilbertian. The council would meet in
the morning for business, which consisted largely
of the visitors calling their Adelaide hosts traitors
and blacklegs. Then the council would adjourn for
a picnic, during which speeches would be made, the
visitors calling the same hosts the finest gentlemen
in Australia. Back to town for a banquet; more
speeches, comparing Heaven rather unfavorably with
South Aus. Next morning business again, and pro-
bably a motion to expel South Aus. from the council
for conduct unsportsmanlike and contrary to the
true principles of unionism! The trouble is that,
during a temporary squabble with the Victorian
League long ago, S.A. fixed up to play inter-State
games for five vears with the Vic. Association. The
council’s leave was asked, but at that time the thing
didn’t seem to matter. Now, however, the agreement
has been renewed for another five, on an alleged
legal opinion that the play cannot be regarded as
constituting an inter-State match, wherefore S.A. is
not flouting the Union. Several prominent Adelaide men
made it clear that they disapprove altogether, and
will stand by the council if it expels their own
League. Ultimately, the latter was given till next
December to break its contract with the Vic. Ass.
somehow.
Sydney has secured the next inter-State
Australian Rules football carnival, in 1914 ; and
there may be a lot of developments before then.
At Adelaide on Saturday Tasmania (S
goals 14 behinds) beat Westralia (8 goals 9 be-
hinds), and thus ended the inter-State Australian-
rule ’oofball competition. South Aus. conies out on
top, followed by Vic. ; then Tassy and Westralia,
and Mother a good last.
Sydney Rugby League football on Satur-
day bristled with good play, although it was rather
too strenuous in places. The titbit was Eastern
Suburbs’ downing of Glebe (leaders in the competi-
tion) by 18 points to 8, in a game which was even
in play, the difference in points being credited to
the booting capacity of Messenger. Each side scored
two tries; but while Messenger kicked six goals,
Algie booted only one on Glebe’s behalf over the bar.
So far as accurate kicking is concerned, Messenger
is in a class by himself, and until other clubs
specialise in the same department, Messenger’s club
has a pull on the premiership. In the other matches.
Western Suburbs defeated Newtown by 14 to 8, and
thereby dragged them from a scat near the top of
the table; South Sydney wiped out North Sydney
by 13 to 6; and Annandale did ditto to Balmain
by 11 points to 7. The result of the play is to even
up the competition ; Glebe and S. Sydney now share
top place with 18 points, Eastern Suburbs has 16,
Newtown 13, and Annandale 11. The others are
beyond hope of glory.
Rugby League football got out of bounds
in Sydney on Saturday. In the Annandale v. Bal-
main tussle at Wentworth Park, rough play and free
fights were the order of the afternoon. When the
referee found the game had beaten the whistle,
the police lent a hand, and diminished the vigor of
the fight. The kick-up was a disgrace to both teams.
At North Sydney a milder display of hoodlumism
was let loose, and umpire Ballerum was hooted
vigorously for decisions which didn’t suit an army
of one-eyed barrackers. The Rugby League’s inquiry
into these side shows should be searching, and its
boot should be heavy.
* * * *
Rugby Union football in Sydney on Sat-
urday brought an end to half of the first-grade com-
petition, when Glebe downed Eastern Suburbs by 16
points to 13, and pocketed the B division honors.
In the A section, University trampled on Newtown
by 19 to 12, and made an unusuallv even tie, the
figures being thiswise: —
Points.
Wins. Losses. For. Against. Points.
Newtown 10 3 222 99 20
University ..10 3 182 95 20
When two clubs agree so evenly, a play-off is the
only satisfactory solution, and the match will be
decided on September 2.
N.S.W. Rugby Union will make a splash
in Sydney on Saturday, with a Queensland XV. and
three teams from N.S.W. country districts. The
Bananalanders will play the inter-State rubber. The
extra-heavy menu will probably test the Union’s
financial feet, and, if the shows are not patronised
by the public, those at the helm of the Rugby Union
will be in a tight place.
The final of the Northern (N.S.W.) Dis-
tricts Rugby Union at Newcastle, on Saturday, pro-
vided an exceptionally fine game. Blair Swannell
was forwarded from Sydney to control the whistle,
and a big crowd gave him an unusual cheer at the
conclusion of the play. The match ended in the
triumph of Norths over Easts by 8 points to 4, and
the winners thus retained ilie premiership honors
gathered in last year. #
Sydney MetroD. Rugby Union rose to the
occasion last week, and disqualified a player for
“life” for biffinp- an opponent and insulting the
referee. Now, what is wanted is for the various
sections of football to recognise each other’s dis-
qualifications.
* * * *
The destination of the Association Cup
for Sydney Soccer was settled on Saturday, and there
is little doubt about the Rawson Gup. The Associa-
tion mug goes to Balmain, and unless something
little short of a miracle happens the other will go
on Balmain’s kitchen shelf. Balmain B and Bal-
gownie have qualified for the Gardiner Pot, and now
they will have to fight it out with Powerful.^
N.S.W. out-Soccered Tasmania in Hobart on
Saturday to the extent of 5 goals to 3. This is the
first inter-State Soccer match, and it was fast and
furious all the way. Oldfield, Taylor, Pallier, and
Howieson did most to make it so on the Ma State’s
side.
League games were suspended in Mel-
bourne "on Saturday, so the hoofball was uninterest-
ing. Brunswick and Port vainly strove to monopolise
the' last place in the final four, but as both suc-
cumbed, they are still dead-level. ’Wick had a
chance of beating Essendon, but lost it through poor
kicking—s goals 13 behinds to ’Don’s 8 goals 8 be-
hinds —but Port never had a hope against North,
and was outed by 82 points to 35. Pr’an pulverised
’Scray by 85 to 59 ; Northcote dittoed Preston by
66 to 30, and Brighton came out of its shell and
smashed its Bayside opponent, ’Town, by 58 to 37.
* * * *
More spectators than witnessed any of the
aforementioned games went to Fitzfoy to sample an
exhibition of Soccer between English-born and Scot-
tish-born Australians. It was a pleasing episode in
dexterous foot-work and hefty head-work; but the
spectators—nearly all Australian-game barrackers —
reckoned that the brand lacks the prettiness and
“lightness” of their own tipple, and is of little ath-
letic use to man as he is, though it would make an
ideal recreation for an armless race. The English-
men won by 4 goals to 2. #
The football season in Adelaide has been
chiefly remarkable for the horrid slump of Norwood,
always accustomed to be in the running for top
place. They have lost a lot of good men, and while
the new lot is coming on they are in trouble. Lately
they met Port Adelaide, their old rivals, and went
down by 16 goals 21 behinds to 6 goals 4 behinds —
117 points to 40. It is supposed to be the worst
thing that has ever happened to Norwood in all
its 40 years or so of existence.
Australian Rules first-grade footballers
kept off the grass in Sydney, on Saturday, and inter-
state juniors had a blow-out. N.S.VU' (two teams)
won the two matches —against Queensland by 62
points to 10, and against South Aus. by 37 points
to 25. The clever play of the iuniors impressed
older players with the hard fact that their football
boots won’t be hard to fill. #
Tbe wisest Yarrasiders on Saturday visited
the Metropolitan Cricket Ground to see an inter-
state contest at lacrosse—the attractive game which
combines the vigor of football with the elegance of
cricket. South Aus. was meeting Victoria for the
nineteenth time, and had sent its best team over. It
had won regularly in the earlier years, and had 13
games to credit: but of late the Murray Staters have
done better, their record being four matches, while
last vear’s collision ended in a draw. The Crow-
eaters’ dash and manipulation were fine, but their
passing lacked certainty. The Vies, were fast, but
hardly as dashing; a few fumbled slightly, but their
passing was a thing of beauty and a joy till further
orders. Also, the Vies.’ defence was a shade stronger
than that of their opponents. At half-time the
board showed: Vic. 4 goals, S.A. 3. In the third
quarter S.A. played its best, and notched two more
goals while preventing the Yarrasiders from getting
any; but in the last quarter the latter’s “homes”
got possession, passed the ball most artistically, and
drove it into the net twice, while the Croweaters
made no further headway. So the Vies., with 6
goals to 5, raised their inter-State score to five
matches, and felt good.
* * * *
Exit William Squires and his punch. It
is a long while since there was a championship con-
test in which so little interest was taken as in the
Lang-Squires disturbance of last week. Squires’s
punch had come bach for the 500th visit; this time
when it came back it evidently went right past him,
and he missed it* Lang took only one or two biffs
throughout the match, and then knocked “Boshter
Bill” down three times in the fifth round, and the
third time Bill’s corner threw in the cotton-ware.
The Bulletin didn’t wait to inquire if the usual
“better man” had won, but guessed he had. Ar-
rangements are now being made to bring Bill Turner
and Lang together. Lang is quite cheerful about
it; for, though he is a long way off being the white
hope, he will take a lot of beating in Australia.
The White man is going to play an insig-
nificant part in the big boxing season which will
commence at the Stadium (Rushcutter’s Bay, Syd-
ney), on Saturday night, but the sons of Ilam will
wax [at upon advertisement and the national cur-
rency. When Johnson, Langford and McVea have
eaten such entries as Boshter Bill Lang, Bill Squires
(the man who some years ago was alleged to have
lost a punch), and Jack Lester (who was sent all
the wav from Canada to see if he could find the
one Bill lost), there will be a great opportunity for
a civil war in the black camp, and if the Mcln-
stoush can start a genuine outbreak, Sydney will
down tools and stampede to the slaughter-house in a
body. A sufficiently large-sized pile of bank-notes
would probably set fire to Lit’le Arthah and Samuel
Langford, and the chances of the pile being forth-
coming are not so remote as floods in the Cotter.
In addition to the coons, Clabby and Jack Dillon
will also unpack their Yankee methods of assault
in the big arena : but matters will not be the same
cakewalk for them that they will be for the heavy-
weights. Dave Smith, who threatens to lead himself
in triumph to Amei ica and Britain next year;
Jack Howard, who is looked upon by his friends, and
a respectable number of his enemies, as a likely
future heavyweight; and Hughie Mehegan are tuned
like fiddle-strings. Charlie Griffin, who knows the
American buff work and foul-fighting so well that
lie can see it coming in time to send for the
police, is also hopeful that a foreign lightweight
scalp or two will be hung on his corner, especially
that of Billy Elliott, who is bringing one from the
country where good old roast beef is encountered by
millions and millions of the inhabitants three or
four times a year, according to luck and the benefits
of Freetrade. Altogether, the session promises to be
the liveliest that Sydney has been introduced to since
the Mclnsplosh whirled into the business.
Stevenson and Lindrum, on their present
terms, make as good a game of billiards as anyone
can ask for. The young ’un receives 4000 in 18,000,
but is restricted in his two-ball play—so much re-
stricted that he rarely resorts to it. Neither man is
at liberty to score off one ball only, red or white,
for more than 25 consecutive times, and, thusfar,
Lindrum has not attempted to find a means of work-
ing more than one innings off the red in the same
break. He plays much the same game as Stevenson,
and for the first four days last week he more than
held his own, at the points. On Friday the “scratch”
man put in some fine work at a great pace, but
Lindrum is quite likely to be ahead again (on the
handicap) when they turn the last corner. The
match finishes at Alcock’s room on Saturday.
* * * *
The final of the N.S.W. amftteur billiard
championship, at Sydney, last week, was very one-
sided. In the early heats T. W. Dann, of Blayney,
outplayed all opposition, and earned the right to
challenge H. Rumball for the title; but then the
country lad crumbled up, and Rumball defeated him
by 547 points in 1500. This is the fifth champion-
ship scalp in Rumball’s belt. The next splash will
happen when C. Van der Luft struggles with H.
Rumball for the Australian championship, on Mon-
day next (21st), at Sydney.
* * * *
N.S.W. Bowling Association has at last
got through its troubles by deciding to impose a per
capita tax on all affiliated club members, in order
to gather sufficient shekels to pay a secretary and
otherwise keep its head above water. It was this
proposal which made the noise in the Bowling Asso-
ciation a short while ago, and oyer which the office-
bearers resigned; but members wisely faced the other
way round and carried the proposal to save the Asso-
ciation from chaos. The Association also decided
to join the Australian Bowling Association; so all
the States are now within the fold.

Sydney tennis followers got a shock when
they saw some of the things that had happened to
N.S.AV. players in Queensland. In the singles
matches, Parker was the only one to win a rubber
for N.S.W. ; he beat Turner —6-1, 7-5. St.
John (Q.), who had beaten Parker on Friday,
met Rice on Saturday, and beat him too —0-6,
6-4, 10-8. The doubles were a bit more even,
each State winning two rubbers each. Grand total
for the two days’ play: Bananaland 15 rubbers,
N.S.W. 6. # #
Still another world’s record. The fol-
lowers of Ike Walton met on Saturday for their
annual flv-casting competition, and Dr. H. L. Mait-
land smashed the record by heaving his insect 129 ft.
Ijin. But A. D. Pedlev, a beginner, threw 105 ft.
Bin. and with his 38ft. handicap, won easily. Now,
what about catching a fish?
* * * *
Sydney is promised much excitement in
motor-boat races this summer. Last year Anthony
Hordern’s 33-knot hydroplane Kangaroo easily van-
quished the ordinarv motor-boat Fairbanks for the
blue ribbon; but Messrs. Relph and Griffiths are
after the ’Roo’s scalp. They are constructing a shell to
carry a 120-horse power engine, capable of skimming
over 38 knots—-if the.engine doesn’t fly out of the
water with the concern. Another enthusiast is put-
ting together a 100-h.p. water-vehicle, which is ex-
pected to carry tall speed ; so the boat which gathers
in this season’s championship will need to be greased
. with lightning.

Two more Arnsts —younger brothers of
champion Dick —have come across to the ma'nland
from Maori land, to have a cut at coming cycling
events. The first will probably be the Goulburn-
Svdne.v road race, entries for which closh on August
28. # ,
T. Ellegaard, the Danish crack, won the
professional world’s sprint championship at Rome,
and thereby equalled Meredith’s record of six suc-
cessive wins. Ellegaard raced in Australia with
fair success a few years back, and must be more
than seven by now. # #
The flying mile in 31 secs.—equal to 116
miles an hour —recently recorded by Bordino on a
300-h.p. car on Saltburn Beach (Eng.), will not be
officially recognised. A record will not be accepted
unless the drive is made in both directions, and the
mean time taken to equalise the effect of the wind ;
and those conditions were not observed.
The semi-finals of the Dunlop inter-club
premiership (20 miles) held up traffic at Homebush
(Sydney) on Saturday, and produced two close
finishes, when Marrickville defeated Balmain, and
Redfern accounted for Western Suburbs. The Red-
fern quartette gathered in their heal in 2min. 9sec.
faster time than the first heat; and in the final (30
miles) on Saturday, they should stir up Marrickville,
which now holds the shield.
Arrangements are being made for a reli-
ability motor-cycle race, from Sydney to Melbourne
(575 miles), similar to the one held last year from
Melbourne to Sydney. Then only two Victorians
started : this time it is expected that from a doziSn
to 15 will line up. #
On Prince of Wales Birthday, under Syd-
ney Rugby League, Maorilander W. F. Trembath
(holder) and Yankee C. E. Holway will contest the
right to the quarter-mile world’s championship, and
Mrs. Drennan (holder) and Miss A Moore will
struggle for the 100yds. Australian ladies cham-
pionship. On the same day the League will give
the Northern District team an opportunity to repeat
the dose it recently administered to Queensland, by
pitting it against a Sydney Metropolitan XIII.
Sydney baseball premiership table was
levelled up on Saturday through Lane Cove (leaders)
heing “whitewashed” by Petersham by 3 runs to 0.
The table stands —Lane Cove and Leichhardt 16 each,
University and Petersham 14 each, Waverley 12—
the balance out of the hunt. As there are only two
rounds to go, and as some of the leading clubs will
clash in them, the premiership has a very open ap-
pearance. # # #
Parramatta-to-Sydney road race on Satur-
day was a weary affair, contested amidst dust and
vehicles. Nearly 40 runners tried the long journey,
and C. Bullivant (20min. start) arrived first, half a
mile ahead of W. Svmonds (18mm.) and H. Bell
(18min.) ; while T. Moore (7min.) takes the fastest
time through getting over the stretch in lhr. 35min.
Moore only picked up 2min. 45sec. on the Winner
during the journey, which shows that handicappers
are making their starts too long.

The amateur officials who controlled the
recent professional footrace at Sydney have been
presented with a bucket of whitewash and a larefe
brush. But the N.S.W. Athletic League isn’t going
to father any more trouble by foolishly sanctioning
a footrace, and allowing amateurs to control it; and
at all matches henceforth members of the profes-
sional concern will hold all the reins.
The dropping-out of various sections from
the N.S.W. Snorting Federation is causing much un-
easiness among those who barrack for lily-white
amateurism in athletics. Recently the Lacrosse
Association leftlast week the Soccer Football As-
sociation followed ; and there are rumors that other
secessions are on the brink. The growth of profes-
sionalism is responsible for much of it; and the
best comfort the lilv-whites can offer themselves is
that the professional outbreak is a mere passing
fever.
Bleriot has been figuring out the cost of
’planing, and after a careful calculation, covering
the cost of machine, house, mechanic, fuel, oil, etc.,
he brings it out at about £3 per air-mile. The
figures do not include anything for doctors bills or
undertakers’ fees, and the tombstone-maker has been
rigidly disregarded.

A PETROL VISION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wild West wind, as cold as Death, tore down
the darkened gorge,
And with it sped a motor red which needed some
repairs ;
Two miles away the blacksmith sat and brooded in
his forge
• Upon the Devil and his works, including liquid
snares.
The smith a thirsty man was he, and many pints
he’d waved,
Ere pouring them, with finished art, a-down his
brawny neck.
But missioners had talked him round and got him
nicely saved ;
The smith felt dry—and dryness tends a drinker’s
nerves to wreck.
McGinty’s calm and ancient goat was browsing in
the dusk
Upon the tender roadside grass, when, like the
mountain blast,
The racing motor leaped at him, and smote his
hairy husk,
And like a feather in the air the ancient goat was
cast.
Three rapid somersaults he turned, and landed in the
place
From which the driver, rocket-like, had soared a
tick before;
And with his forelegs on the wheel, at an excessive
pace,
He drove the flame-like motor-car straight at the
smithy door.
The smith was thinking of his sins, and longing for
a wet,
When, with a whirring rush, the car, with Wil-
liam at the wheel,
Flashed in the door, and, with a rending crash he
can’t forget,
Dashed through the wall and hummed away. A
loud, demented squea l
Bang out upon the ev’ni-ng air, and something wild
with fear
Fled like a rabbit for the hall where all were
praying hard.
It tumbled in and sobbed: “Look out! the Devil’s
raging here!
He called for me just now, an’ only missed me
by a yard !”

HEARTBURN AND INDIGESTION.
Heartburn is a symptom of Indigestion,
and consists of a most distressing and gnaw-
ing pain in the stomach, often with sour,
acid belcliings, nausea and fainting. When
the food is only partially digested, it gives
rise to an accumulation of wind or gas gen-
erated from the excess of acidity from the
imperfectly-digested food. To overcome this
complaint, you should eat sparingly of plain,
digestible foods, and take a course of Dr
Morse’s Indian Root Pills, which will
strengthen the digestive organs, and remove
all acidity from the stomach. These puls
do not merely alleviate the trouble, but get
at the cause, and thus permanently over-
come the trouble. _ ,
Mr. E. B. Garland, “Henbury,” Ruthven-
stret, Waverley, Sydney, _ states "E or
some considerable time 1
have suffered greatly from
Heartburn, Indigestion,
and Liver and Kidney
Troubles, and at times
the pain would be very
great. I was recom-
mended by a friend to
try Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. I started on
a course, and found bn
continuing that they gave
me great relief, and al-
though I have had a re-
turn of the symptoms, a
dose of Dr. Morse’s In-
dian Root Pills never

fails to put me right, and restore me to
health again. We always keep a bottle
handy in case of need. I have pleasure' in
sending you this testimony, which you may
use as you think proper. I have recom-
mended Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills to
many friends, who now always use them.

The kangaroo has leapt into British Par-
liamentary language. The word is applied
to a species of “gag.” The “kangaroo clo-
sure” gives the chairman power to choose
out of a selected group of amendments those
which he holds it most profitable for the
House to discuss. The others are considered
non rst. Presumably the name arises from
the fact that, instead of pattering along
mouse-like from one amendment to another,
right through the whole list, the House
springs from one to another of the selected
group, and thus arrives at a speedier deci-
sion.
“Boswell” produces a parable:—
The hero of this tale was a publican, and he had
the rummiest way of doing things I ever saw. One
day recently his yard-man, a cautious servitor gener-
ally, did something which merited dismissal, and
was rewarded with the order of the sack accord-
ingly. Mr. Bung then proceeded to also sack his
barman, barmaid, cook, groom, waitresses, house-
maids, laundresses, runner, chauffeur, and boots. In
addition, he handed in to the Licensing Court the
resignation of himself and the missus, and recom-
mended that the chap who had previously opposed
his license should be sent for and installed in the
premises, with a brand-new staff. Being an old
chum, I remonstrated with him on his ridiculous
course of action, and received the staggering reply
that he was a strong believer in Party Government,
and that what was right for the country must be
right for the individual.
The Wimmen’s National League is in
trouble again in Melbourne, and its secre-
tary, Miss Eleanor Cameron, has sacked
herself with great determination. The lady
had only been a few months in the service
of the League, but, during that time, she
led a life that ladies usually describe as
“trying.” It is said that the catmittee of
the League resented her “pretensions,” and
she resented the catmittee’s interference.
The result was a “difference,” which ended
with furious resignation.
“Vulcan”: Immigration’s all right, and
the passionate wail about “the great dearth
of labor” develops large drops of brine on
my lashes ; .but what’s the use of it while
the sweating “commercial community” is
promoting emigration for all it’s worth V
Take an instance. A friend of mine recently
advertised for a clerk for Fiji, offering a
munificent £2 weekly and quarters. He re-
ceived over a hundred replies—9o per cent,
from persons already in employment; 70 per
cent, of them in wholesale warehouses in
various capacities. Now what sort of
“sweat” conditions are they that can animate
over 100 persons to rush the chance of a
whole weekly 40 bob in a stew-hole like
Fiji? A few more Wages Boards are
wanted badly.

And to the music of the concertina
He danced an Irish jig;
The proprietors sent for a policeman
Who roughly turned him out;
But he whirled and twirled like fury
And kicked his legs about;
The officer had to arrest him,
But the mick did not care a fig,
On the way to the city lock up
He danced an Irish jig.

With sorrow to my knee?”
And still they came and made a noise
’Twas pitiful to hear,

More sworn testimony in the matter of
bringing rural workers under Industrial
law: —
Teaching the children of the Cow-cockies for the
past seven years has provided me with plenty of ex-
amples of the sweating of children in order to swell
the cream cheque. The worst cases are those of the
unfortunate, mostly orphaned, State children. Gen-
erally speaking, these are treated shamefully. 1
have had State children in my school who were so
sick with over-work that they could not eat their
bread and treacle at lunch time. These little unfor-
tunates left school at 3.30 p.m. sharp, and ran
home —a distance in one case of two miles —in order
to be in time to get the cows up for milking. 1 had
another State child who was up at 4 o’clock every
morning, and often I have seen him running along
to school at 10 a.m. with his breakfast in his hand,
munching it as he ran.
Lord Brassey, when Governor of Victoria,
was always falling off or into something.
He is still at it. He has just tumbled
from the top to the feminine side of the
fence. In other words, he has been con-
verted to female suffrage. He announced
the fact at a Saturday-night suffragette
meeting at Hastings, the sea-coast town he
represented for many years in the Commons,
and near by Normanhurst, the latter-day
castle of the Brasseys. With heavy, lumber-
ing humor, “Old Tom” said he had found
sitting on the fence very uncomfortable, and
had come to the conclusion that he would
no longer differ from his dear wife. (N.B.
—The dear wife was in the chair.)
Renmark (S.A.), which used to be a
“prohibition” town, now regards beer with
reverence. The township’s incorporated
hotel is showing an approximate profit of
£lOOO per annum. When the mortgages
have been paid off, the surplus cash will all
go towards improving the neighborhood. In
fact, small disbursements are already being
made. The District Council has got £l7o
to put down a new footpath, and the hotel
committee reckons it will be able to hand
over £5OO for that purpose next year. The
local reading institute gets an annual xA),
and other grants include £5O to the Young
Men’s Guild. So much public good is done
and so little private harm that there is talk
of declaring a perpetual close season for
Wowsers in that part of S. Aus.
Said the Age on a recent morning:—
The business of sugar refining is virtually an Aus-
tralian monopoly. .. . The whole problem lies in
dealing with the monopoly which stands between the
producer and the consumer, taking toll from both.
That is a matter for Parliament.
And the Age which says that is the Age
which, a few months ago, furiously fought the
proposal to give Parliament the power to
deal with the matter. The _ Bulletin is
getting rather tired of hearing all these
people confess what fools they -were.

WILLIAM CRAIG, F.C.P.A.,
The Chairman said:—
Ladies and Gentlemen, —In moving the adoption of the Report and Balance Sheet for t e a year
ended 30th ultimo, with a recommendation of a dividend at the rate of 2J per cent, per anmini ( jv
with 3* per cent, paid at the end of last half-year, a total of 3 per cent, for the whole year), 1 ciesire x
say the Board’s determination was arrived at after very careful consideration of the w h°l® P°®, R ’ k >„
with a feeling of confidence that the shareholders will appreciate a conservative policy whereby tn
business is. conducted on careful lines, and with ample provision for all contingenices.
paring the present figures with those of 12'months ago, the'satisfactory’ growth of the p whil „ the
shown by the following There has been an increase in the advances to customers of £ 30 0,U5d, wmit xi e
Fixed Deposits and Current Credit Accounts show in all an increase of £454,758, and the hold g ’
Government Stocks, and other liquid securities has increased by £230,000. It may be of inteit - ,
sav that the number of accounts opened in excess of 1 those closed is close on to -900. 1e P P
adverse influence that your Institution has had to contend aga.nst (and which 1S Parlia-
nsuperable difficulty) has been the imposition of the Graduated Land Tax by our of the
uient, which has been found to be considerably more than we anticipated. It will be tne aim oi uie
Board to reduce in every way possible our landed property holdings, so that the present inroad into oui
profits which the payment of this tax means may be curtailed. The federal Notes Act has also had an
adverse effect, but the loss to this Bank by the change in this direction is not very the
realisation of the properties transferred to us by the Old Bank has proceeded very satisfactorily during
past half-year, and no opportunity to sell, where fair prices have been obtainable, has been lost. It will
satisfactory to shareholders to know that so far the valuations of the securities taken at the time cff the
reconstruction have been more than borne out by the sales that have been made. The response that. ou
shareholders have made to the invitation to influence business to the Bank is shown s °™awhat, by the
figures of increase in the number of accounts mentioned by_ me in the first part of this report, but muc
more can be done in this direction. The security we offer is shown to be more than ample by the figures
of the Balance Sheet now before you, and we have the staff and all other necessaries for carrying on a
very much larger business than we have at present at a minimum of cost.
* Having read the above, the Chairman added: I may supplement what I have read by saying
These observations, ladies and gentlemen, may be taken to be the observations of the whole of e
directors, and I might particularly refer in that regard to the gentlemen elected six ™°^ h i- r a JSfelt ft
sent you on the Board. The Board may be said to be very largely a new Board. The “ew felt]it
to be their duty to make a very close examination of the assets of the Institution and. oft thea
they must be commended for their industry during that time. Their inquiries I k " 0W o been very
close, very searching, and thev are very capable men in respect of their ability to make such an examina
tion. When I say the observations are the observations of the whole of the Board you will understand what
significance that remark carries. • . . , ' ’
Now, the next point I will refer to is with regard to the realisation of th f f a - policy has
been, without in anv way sacrificing or depreciating your properties, to realise such assets as should no
ordinarily be considered part of a Bank’s stock-in-trade, but you know the if*?*™®* .riLL m iaw ken
assets as they were. It must be very gratifying to you to know that such large, realisations b een
made at more than they were taken over by the Institution. .But, more than that, to-day wc are in re °®W
of an offer of a considerable sum of money for a large pastoral property, , a " d that offer w with:™ piking
distance too of the amount that the property stands m your books, that being for a pastoral
one of those’properties which are most undesirable assets for a. Bank—it must be
It is practically at book value. The offer has only been received this morning, and will be dealt with in
dUe Now, 6 with regard to the comparison of this half-year’s figures with last half year inthe mattor of
profits. You will readily realise that last half-year the amount of the land^tax .thatany
have to pay was not known, and therefore could not be exactly estimated and included in the accounts lor
the half-year. We did provide for the land tax to some extent, hut when the matter was dealt with by
the band Tax Commissioner we found we had under-estimated .the land tax for the previous nan year.
The Commonweal?h "and tax" is, as you know, a graduated tax and every Bank iri the. whole o! the Stote
ef Australia has to Dav a tax in respect of their several holdings wherever they may be. inasmuen as

is to ellc? two Dh-ectoroin place of Dr. Sly and Mr. Mark Sheldon. There being no other candidates, 1
declare Dr Sly and Mr. Mark Sheldon duly elected.
Dr Slv • I think I ought to thank you for your renewed confidence. Of course I did not anticipate

renreseto you I would like to say that, in dealing with the business of the Bank, the greatest care has
hten exermsed bv every Director oh the Board, and having been a Director for the past four years I look
with the greatest confidence to the future success o*f the Bank. Of course, some remarks might be made
the smallness of the dividend, but this indicates a conservative policy. 1 can assure every share-

have mfd dividend, the Directors would not put one penny to profit unless justified m every way.

and nush f referred to the realisation of the assets taken over by the Bank at its ;in-
when it bought out the A.J.S. Bank, Ltd. I can assure you, gentlemen, no opportunity is being
mfssed ’to same, as the Board know the vital importance of this course of action for the following
missel ,° T t n i ace we f ee i that these are prosperous times m these States, .and as such are good
rea TfnniHes to realise Secondly, the money we will obtain in realisation will be more profitably : and
STmately^employed in the banking business proper. Thirdly our Profit and Loss Account will be
also by the realisation of these assets, by the amount of graduated land tax saved.
Wnw heforp I sit down, I would ask that shareholders, both in this State and Queensland, as also m Great
Britain should remember the old saying, “The gods help those who help themselves,’’ and remember to try
and influence some of their business to this Bank. Some of the shareholders have been doing it, more so
every day. Gentlemen, I again thank you.
The Chairman: The next business is the election of two Auditors.
Mr Yarwood - I have much pleasure in moving that Mr. AVilliam Craig and Mr. George Mason Allard,
both Fellows of the Corporation of Public Accountants, be and they are hereby elected Auditors of The
Australian Bank of Commerce, Ltd., for the ensuing 12 months, at a payment of £lOO each.
Mr Perry: I have much pleasure in seconding the nomination of those gentlemen. • Carried.
The Chairman: That is the business, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr R McAnderson: I have much pleasure in proposing a vote of thanks to the Directors, General
Manager and Officers of this Bank. lam extremely pleased that by our acquiescence and abstention from
priticism during the remarks of the Chairman and his colleagues, we showed that we agree entirely with
what has been done. I think the Chairman has no need to be nervous about the reduced dividend; the
shareholders are behind him in whatever is done, and we came here quite satisfied with things as they
Some of us came here because we thought there might be hostile criticism. There are always a
fpw neoDle who know how to manage better than those who are doing it, but in this case the number is a
negligible aua ntitv. We find that there is absolute confidence in the Board, and I think we ought to
prnr>ha si se that. At last half-yearly meeting we added a strong trio to the Board, and we are glad to
hear them speak in the temperate but confident wav they did. They know best, so we are quite satisfied
with whatever dividend is recommended. I would like to emphasise what the Chairman and Mr. Sheldon
have said about we ourselves, as shareholders, assisting bv bringing in new business. It is an old-
fashioned way but the best, and it is up to us to do it. I ask you to carry the resolution by acclamation.
The Chairman: It is gratifying to receive the vote of thanks moved by one who is so capable. You
mav be assured of this that we will strive to make vour Institution one of the foremost Institutions in
New South Wales, and also in Queensland. There is a lot of room for expansion, and with your aid and
influence there will be that expansion. I would like to say one thing as showing the nature of the
valuations Consols stand in our books at the lowest point; they stand at the price they are quoted ’>
London to-day That should give confidence as to the way in which we have dealt with the assets.


Eight Bare Patches on Child’s Head
Skin Raised, Crusted and Irritated
Afraid of Losing All Her Hair.
Cured After Using Box of Cuticura
Ointment with Cuticura Soap.
"I am pleased to say my little girl’s head
is completely cured aftei using one box of
Cuticura Ointment and also washing her
head with Cuticura Soap. You would like
to know about the case, I am sure.
“It started first by her hair coming out in
combfuls, leaving a spot about the size of a
shilling. The skin looked raised and crusted
and irritated her very much. Naturally I
became very anxious when I saw eight' dif-
ferent bare patches on her head. I was afraid
6he was going to lose all her hair. I tried two
well advertised remedies and they did no
good, so I took her to a skin hospital. The
doctor told me it was ringworm and to keep
her from school, which 1 did. I attended the
hospital with her for seven weeks. I used
two large boxes of the ointment which they
prescribed, on her head every week and she
had to wear a black calico cap. Her poor
little face became swollen and red wherever
the ointment touched it.
“One day I sent for a box of Cuticura
Ointment. After thoroughly cleansing her
head of all the old ointment, I started in
with the Cuticura. The second dressing
with it seemed to take the irritation away,
and soon we saw an improvement. Before
I had quite finished the box of Cuticura
Ointment, her head was quite clear and the
hair growing over the bald spots. Now her
hair has grown beautiful and long, with noth-
ing but the Cuticura Ointment and the
Cuticura Soap, with which I wash it.”
(Signed) Mrs. Noon, 3, Grey Rock St., West
Derby Rd., Liverpool, Eng.. May 23, 1910.
The Cuticura Remedies afford the most
economical treatment for the skin, scalp
and hair from infancy to age A tablet of
Cuticura Soap and a box of Cuticura Oint-
ment are often sufficient. Sold throughout

only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair V the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

Just decided by an Adelaide, court that for a boy

“T. Tufthunter”: Evidently among Fat’s would-be
smart women-folk un-patriotism is an . hereditary
taint. In the World’s Work for April, Miss M. M.
Maxwell writes: “The English, woman will have
foreign-made goods. She thinks nothing is smart
unless it is French, or at least foreign. She con-
tinually asks, ‘ls it imported’ ? And if you tell her,
‘No, madam, it was made in Lancashire,’ she will
not buy it l ”
The chiefs of the Weary State’s Education Depart-
ment lately held a conference to consider the mo-
mentous question of the supply of stores to up-
oountrv schools. The Department’s habit is to call
for tenders, and the successful tenderer —-who, of
course, generally dwells in Melbourne, —supplies the
whole State. But when the Ballarat Agricultural
High School lately ordered a two-shilling bottle of
ink, and found that the freight and cartage cost
more than the ink, the Department perceived that
something was wrong. A private’ firm doing a similar
widespread business would make each branch buy
such trifles out of the petty cash; but the idea of
the State buying anything except from a Melbourne
shop is, of course, so revolutionary that it takes a
lot of thinking over.
“Factory Manager”: I agree that the position of
the Australian butter business in England is bad
(B. 13/'j/’ll) ; and the Australian Government is
going the. wrong way to .improve it. Here’s an in-
stance. Our factory has just put through a churning
of cream, which produced nearly a half-ton of butter
—to supply an order for the London market, un-
salted (or “fresh,” as they term it in the Cold
Country). Although it complied in every respect
with the English law, it couldn’t pass as butter up
to the Australian official notions, because when we
took it from the worker it analysed 15.5 p.e. of
moisture. Minister Tudor says this is excessive, and
prejudicial to the consumer’s interests. Well, we re-
■ worked an already perfect production—-as we con-
tend—and a reduction of 0.1 p.c. in moisture fol-
lowed, the test showing 15.4 p.c. This being still
0.4 p.c. over the standard, what were we to do?
London required “fresh,” and we could not comply
with the Lockyer-cam-Tudor trade description (15
p.c.) and send this re-worked greasy-looking sub-
stance to the most critical and particular market in
the world. So we had to -.touch it up with 3 p.c. of
salt and market it locally. Now, two points: (1)
Why should Australian consumers have to (this ad-
visedly) eat second-quality butter? And (2) why
should Frank G. Tudor prevent London, getting our
surplus A 1 product, in its best (and natural) con-
lition ?
* * * *
“Quidam”: The most outstanding feature in Aus-
tralian commerce is the tremendous striking-out,
since the removal of inter-State tariffs, of the great
distributing houses, and the enormous expansion of
mail-order business. The mammoth city concerns
buy shiploads of merchandise direct from the
makers, and don’t have to add wholesale merchants’
profits to the price; further, they have no bad debts
and don’t have to stand out of their capital for
months. The result is that the small trader—country
trader especially—is barely holding his own. ‘The
customers are undoubtedly benefiting by the con-
centration of business; the only question is whether,
when the unequal battle has crushed the smaller
adversaries out, or reduced them to merely acting
as agents for the few kings of commerce, those
kings, instead of foolishly competing against each
other,' and thereby reducing their profits, won’t come
to a gentlemanly understanding, and thereafter pro-
ceed to take as much as they can get out of the
public. The clear-sighted business man of to-day
has ceased to esteem the old adage, “There is no-
thing like competition,” and has substituted, “There
is nothing like amalgamation.” Consequently the
whole-souled Socialist, when he saves twopence-
ha’penny by sending a mail-order to some universal
providery, can at least console himself with the re-
flection that, in assisting to further swell the profits
of Private Enterprise, he is in reality dealing a
smashing blow at the competitive system on which
Private Enterprise has hitherto based its claim to
support.
“Itan”: Not half enough is made of the curative
value of Australian bore water for certain ailments,
especially rheumatism. We hear eloquent remarks
about the virtues of the hot springs of other coun-
tries, but because our own equally valuable method
of treatment carries the Australian brand, the en-
thusiasm is about equal to a pint of dead soda. It
is declared that the very hot mineral water from
the Muckadilla bore, 26 miles beyond Roma (Q.),
seldom, if ever,, fails to effect a cure, and that people
so infirm that they had to be carried to the water
were able to walk freely after treatment. Some time
ago the Government went so far as to mark a
site for a sanatorium there, and the matter should
not be lost sight of. It wouldn’t be if the authori-
ties were confronted with a procession of Australians
who are absolute cripples through diseases of the
rheumatic order. A crippled citizen is a bad asset,
"nd when the cure is lying idle on the premises, he
is a fool’s asset.
THE GENTLEMAN HELP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Wanted, Situation as Gentleman-Help to middle-
aged lady of means ; cook, washing Hud music.
“Harpsichord,” Star Office.- —Christchurch Star
(M.L.).
If a kindly, wealthy lady,
With her years upon the shady
Side of not too blissful, kissful
Thirty-two,
Wants a “help” to cook the dinner,
Or to biff the cadging sinner,
And preside with touch artistic
O’er the stew,
Here’s a gent, would wear a pinny
For a paltry weekly guinea,
Don a smile to coax a cherub
From his perch;
And, on Sunday, I’ve a notion
lie would join the sweet devotion
Of his mistress, if permitted,
In the church.
He would like to know the measure
Of her income, for of treasure
He has laid up precious little
On this earth ;
And, in case her means are ample,
And her life a bright example
He may put up for a brief time
With the berth.
When he’s finished with the kitchen,
He can thump in most bewitchin’
Style a waltz or sweet Schubertian
tnelodie ;
And, on days when he’s untethered,
And the weekly wash .is weathered,
lie can flash it in the best So-
Cietee.
Be the lady built on slender
Lines artistic, be she tender
In her leanings, or utili-
Tarian,
She will find he cooks with vigor
And his laundry work’s de rigueur,
And his manners show the perfect
Gentleman i

“C-Mahers of Hi&hGrade Pianos j
THE greatest improvement in piano construction during the past 40 years was brought about by our invention of
a simple, but thoroughly efficient steel tuning system, in place of the wooden system still used in foreign pianos.
This invention is patented throughout the world, and is obtainable only in Beale High-Grrade Pianos. Its
success is beyond question, as any one of 15,000 buyers of Beale Pianos can tell you.. We have used it for the past
nine years in all our pianos, and from the first day that a Beale Piano was issued with the Beale-Yader .Patent kteel
Tuning System, right up to the present day, we have never had one single complaint in connection with the tuning system.
This record is unique in the history of piano manufacture, for the tuning system has hitherto always been the weakest
part of pianos. The necessity for a steel tuning system is pointed out by Mr. Edgar Brinsmead, of Messrs. Jo in
Brinsmead and Sons, London, makers of the Brinsmead Pianos, who says in his book ( <e lhe History of the liano orte )
that the driving of iron pegs into a wooden plank is “a primitive plan” which “neither secures nor retains accuracy ,
and he says the wood “ occasionally ” splits, “ frequently ” loses its holding power, and is “ invariably affected by climatic
changes. Yet that “primitive” system is still used by foreign piano makers. Herr Julius Bluthner, of Leipsic, maker
of Bluthner Pianos, publishes methods whereby “the risk of splitting and warping” with the wooden tuning system
may be “ reduced but not abolished. The British and Colqnial Piano Journal says (March, 1911, page 75) that the
“fault” of pianos with the wooden tuning system “ not staying in tune” is “recognised by piano manufacturers all
over the world.” , . J . TT , ' • ~ ,
Hundreds of inventions of metal tuning systems have been patented, but the Beale-Vader system is the only
thoroughly simple and efficient one, overcoming all the difficulties referred to, and other difficulties which we have not
here mentioned. And in addition, the Beale-Yader Patent Steel Tuning system secures a greatly improved quality of tone,
so .free from .all harsh and metallic qualities, and so mellow and so musical that among singers especially our pianos
are particularly admired for their unequalled suitability for accompanying the human voice. ■
If you are thinking of buying a piano, you should let us explain the wonderful simplicity and efficiency of the
Beale-Yader Patent Steel Tuning System; and let us show you, or send you, the written opinions of our competitors as to
the necessity for a steel tuning system.
Bo this, for it may save you a large sum of money.

MR. DONALD McDONALD (the well-known writer)
describes the trip as follows: —
the greater part of the journey on the Queensland coast the steamer runs between the
Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, making it one of the smoothest of the sea trips of Aus-
tralasia. The route is dotted with picturesque islands, covered with foliage strange to
southern eyes, and the boat is ever rounding headlands, streaming into fine bays and estuaries. The
famous Whitsunday Passage, between Mackay and B.owen, is’extremely picturesque.”

J Catarrh of
the Stomach.
25 O’Grady Street, Albert Park, Vic.
Dear Sirs, —I was suffering from catarrh of the stomach for a period of
o\ ef four months and lost 16 lb. in weight. I used to have severe pains in
the stomach after meals and mouthfuls cf water would come up and
I could only get relief when the food itself came up. I decided to try Angier’s
Emulsion, add the first week after I began taking it I gained 4 lb., and soon
went up to my usual weight. I .am now able to eat my food without fear of
the awful pains, and shall always feel most .grateful for the relief I have :
gained from the Emulsion. (Signed) T. LOVELL.

IN
BANANALAND
Contract shearing is likely to be wiped out
iu Bananaland after this season. The'
A.W.U. is taking a ballot upon the ques-
tion, and the, result is said to be sure;
“Fighting parson” Saps has broken down
at Winton, from overtraining, aud has just
left the local hospital. So he is out of the
boxing championships at Charters Towers
and Brisbane.
.Bung, in Bananaland, doesn’t like the new
Licensing Bill, of course, but he has hopes;
for though no compensation whatever is pro-
vided for in case of a reduction of licenses,
the sudden-death-can’t happen until 1917 at
the very earliest; and there’s many a slip be-
betwixt the cup and 1917.
Brisbane’s Mayoress remarked, concerning
her. recent Hospital Saturday collecting ex-
periences : “Even the Chinamen did not pass
without leaving a coin.” Probably true.
Public mendicancy is common in China, and
is one of the Australian customs reminding
John of home.
Again the fierce land hunger in Banana-
land. The other day 337 applicants ballotted
for 118 sections thrown open on Taabinga.
And the worst of it is that Queensland has
but little guarantee that the 118 successful
ballotters mean bona-fide selection and farm-
ing. Ten years ago Queensland was far
ahead of Westralia in the area under culti-
vation. To-day the situation is reversed. The
real curse of the North is land speculation.
One ancient and experienced Queens-
lander, at any rate, has no hopes that the
champagne days will last for ever. At a.
meeting of the council of the Pastoralists’
Association the other day, president Hood
said he smelt drought in the air—several
districts were getting a taste of it already—
and the wise squatter was the one who
wouldn’t be caught overstocked when the
trouble became general. After all, drought
mostly is merely a matter of over-stocking.
It is much the same as a coach licensed to
carry 20 passengers breaking down utterly
when the rapacious ’bus Idrd tries to pile on
41.
“Altair”: Within 40 miles of a Queens-
land seaport I recently struck a cattle-run of
400; sq. miles, mostly lease and occupation
license, with a sprinkling of freehold. It is
all good pastoral land, and some of it is good
arable land. One of Queensland’s biggest
rivers runs through it. The whole lot p--
managed and \vorked by one family of six
members, no '6'utside labor 'being employed.
The population is thus one and a-half to the
hundred square miles. The Government
charges f 1 per square mile, rent, and that’s
all it gets out of a block of country capable
of settling hundreds of families. Even the
despised Bingliis made better use of it.
Tfie Denham Government missed a fine
chafice. Secretary Hinchcliffe, on behalf" of
the; sugar strikers, offered reasonable and
even submissive terms of peace—practically
a temporary surrender of all claims, except
the increase of the white-Kanaka wage of
3s. 9d. per day to a modest ss. The C.S.R.
and its underlings refused this offer with
hurried contempt. Had the Government
then accepted Hinchcliffe’s proposal with re-
gard to its own mills, and pressed it on the
C.S.R. with the loaded threat of a State re-
finery, the strike would have ended in a day
or two. But the auspicious moment passed,
and instead of being covered with glory, the
Government came out smeared , with C.S.R.
molasses.
Died at Rockhampton, on August 9, Wil-
liam Davis, who went to Rockhampton in
1862, to take up the billet of overseer on
the Rockhampton Bulletin, which had
been 'established a few months before. The
following year he gave up the job to become
town clerk, and he stuck to that job for
3S years. Then old age tapped him on the
shoulder, and suggested an easy chair.
The new Bananaland Licensing Bill was
tabled in the Assembly the other night. It
provides, among other things, for the aboli-
tion of the honorary licensing magistrate,
the restriction of barmaids’ hours from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m., with one hour off for a meal,
an increase of license fees, and the estab-
lishment of local option. No local option
vote, however, is to be taken till 1917, and
there must be a request . fqr .a vote to be
taken. Resolutions which may be submitted
are (a) one-fourth reduction; (b) further
reduction of one-fourth when “a” has been
carried; (c) further reduction of one-fourth
where “b” has been carried; (d) total pro-
hibition; (c) the issue of new licenses.
DEAD SURE.
C OUNSEL. (to [?] wit-
ness): "Now, Sir,
I’ll warn you to be
careful, sir, and to
remember your oath. Now , then, sir ! Will you swear that only one shot was fired?”
AUSTRALIAN: “ [?] I swear? Why, I'll give you six to four about it."
Passed out at Longreach, aged 74, A. C.
■ Sutton, one of Queensland’s pioneers. Born
in London in 1837, he went to Tasmania
with his parents in 1841, and afterwards
passed on to Sydney, thence to Blackall
(Q.) in 1862.
“Blackall”: Left-hander Les Seaty must
have been a sick man when he was shearing
at Galway Downs, if his highest tally there
was only 219 (B. 27/7/T1). Had a look
at the tally-board at Blackall Woolscour
last week, and Seary was credited there with
one 236 and another 238. The tipping is
that Livingstone won’t compete in the Janu-
ary shearing match, as I understand he is
bound to one make of machine. It’s a
machinery-makers’ competition, and it will
take a lot of manoeuvring to get Les Seary,
Livingstone, Ted Dean, and such leaders to
start on equal terms for a square go, Not
that the world will cease to revolve if they
never meet, but it’s a pity commercialism
and sport are such deadly enemies.
“Arcalp”: “Wanted for station, married
couple, no encumbrance,” etc., is no good to
the squatter up Blackall way. That’s the
back-o’-beyond, where you have to be careful
not to step off Australia. Station-owners
out there have a competition on as to how
many kiddies to the acre their respective sta-
tions will carry ; so far the Woolscour leads
by a good head. It’s the only sheep place in
Australia I’ve struck where “encumbrances”
are encouraged, and it cries a loud shame to
closer-in squatterdom.
As hard a blow as was ever landed on the
solar plexus of Queensland Bumbledom was
delivered the other day by Governor Mac-
gregor, who innocently said :
The weakest point in Queensland Local Government
is the neglect of public parks, water supply and
drainage.
As parks, water supply, drainage and roads
are almost the only big concerns managed by
Queensland local authorities, and as (accord-
ing to his Ex.) they badly neglect three
functions out of tue four, the impeachment is
pretty sweeping.
Slowly but surely the poorly-paid Free-
trade Britisher is losing his place among the
really; progressive people of the earth. At
the recent (Master) Bakers’ Conference in
Brisbane this statement was made:—
The average German handicraftsman, carefully
trained in technical matters of the baking trade, is
usually far in advance of his English competitors.
... German, French or Austrian bakers are all
ahead of their English-speaking fellow-workmen in
technical knowledge.
And no one called out Pro-Boer, Little Eng-
lander or Disloyalist. We are getting on.
Bananaland is the country of Wasted
Food. When, the other day, E. J. Brady
wrote that he had bought a dozen pineapples,
for eighteenpence in Queensland, a man sent
along regretting that Brady had been cruelly
got at, apd offering him a ton of oranges
for the same money. Now comes the report
of the Government Statistician on the sugar
crop for 1910, showing that, besides some
millions of gallons of molasses which went
to waste without any record being kept,
1,749,655 gallons were admittedly put to no
use whatever. And, of the total of
5,580,215 gallons put to some use, a large
part was consumed merely as fuel or
manure. f
Concerning the Blind Ox that goes Re-
joicing to the Slaughterhouse :
Many Queensland cattle-owners are getting the
weird notion into their lump of grey matter that
the coming of the Beef Trust to Australia will be a
good thing for them. This tragic delusion is reared
on the belief that, the railways being State-owned,
the Trust can do no harm. Coming from Anti-Sosh,
this faithful reliance on Socialistic railways is a
blithering sort of argument; but that does not
matter. The fact is, if the octopus can get its grip
on the export trade, and thus absolutely control the
London market, it won’t care a bullock’s liver who
owns the railways here. The Queensland beefers
have been driving cattle to the slaughterhouse for so
long, that they seem to have become inoculated with
the mental intelligence of the bovine, and are
making their way to their own abattoirs in placid
ignorance.
A Coward Race.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some fell in bloody light, and died
Without posterity,
While others ran for home and life
And fathered you and me.
And that is why, as years go by,
In never-failing crew,
We see the craven bands increase,,
While gallant hearts are few.
The brave are planted in the van,
Where boldly th’ey defy
Shot, steel and shell, while cowards, make'
For home, and multiply.
The gallant live in Hist’ry’s page
And move us as we read ; v >
The cowards mould the living age
And carry on the breed.
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER FLAM.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 12, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
We are all—at least, those of us who are
truly Select —acquiring the bicycle face;
and hobble skirts are "off,” and skirts that
leave our er-limbs free to pedal are on.
Amongst the perspiring humans who have
been raising the dust with their hind wheels
during the week were the Macgregor and
his leddy.- Evidently she over-exerted her-
self, for she has been resting as much as her
engagements have permitted during the past
couple of days.
We take our pleasures in large doses these
days, and carnival with avidity. Even his
Ex. has become rejuvenated, aud the Govt.
House motor dashes here and there in joyous
abandon. The city has been invaded by the
squattocracy and cockydom in large num-
bers, and the air is filled with whiskers and
the scent of gums. Father, mother and the
girls have been milking the last ounce of
pleasure out of their holiday, rushing from
place to place sight-seeing, and exhibiting
all that energy which is making Bananaland
blossom and bloom.
Delegates to the annual conference of
local authorities, accompanied by Mesdames
Delegates, drank tea in the fastnesses of the
Macgregor homestead since last I wrote you.
Local authorities no doubt have their good
points, my dear, but strawberries and cream
are not one of them. Premier Lewis and
dame, en route to Tassy after seeing Bull,
liex and Go.’s Great Circus, and Menagerie,
were among the guests.
Sir Day and Lady Bosanquet, from S. Aus-
tralia’s Government House, with a youthful
aide, have been side-stepping the struggle for
a crust by getting it free under the hospit-
able Macgregor roof. Judging by his speech
thundered forth at the Show official luncheon,
I should estimate the Admiral to have been a
holy terror on the quarterdeck. It was defiant,
challenging, reverberating,, and delivered
sternly from under frowning brows; yet it
was merely a thank-you for a cordial wel-
come.
On Wednesday evening a ball, mostly for
the youthful, was given by sub-regality at the
Technical College Hall, but the pace of the
week had been too much for her Ex. and her
"beg off” procured her a quiet rest at home.
Wee Mac and the Vision saw that the honors
and other delicacies did not fall short of re-
quirements. The decoration of the hall was
the result of a deep-laid scheme of the Scar-
lett aide; and here I record my testimony
that if ever that young man wants a job as
window-dresser in an up-to-date drapery
house, I will be happy to certify that he has
ideas which he knows how to carry out.
Royal blue and crimson, the royal arms, gold
shields and palms made one of the most
boldly effective decorative schemes that Bris-
bane has known. The Vision arrayed herself
in blue, with some beautiful lace; and Lhdy
Bosanquet—who, by the way, is being greatly
admired—showed us something in white
satin, gold tissue and rose point lace, with a
diamond tiara and necklet which reminded
us of the Dudley gems.
Jb'rom early morn till late at night on
Saturday last the unhappy citizen was pur-
sued with hospital boxes, held by pretty
nurses, panting matrons and persuasive in-
fants. The Diddams Mayoress lent her
small daughter, who, disguised as a minia-
ture nurse, proved to be a veritable brigand,
and rifled the foot-traveller of a fair share of
the £5OO collected. The theatrical “Whips”
pursued small change up and down Queen-
street in a motor-car, and pretty Mrs. Ted
Holland and a cluster of vaudeville stars
fished the trembling threepence from its
most secret lair. Miss Macgregor helped
the Mayoress for a couple of hours, and
handed in more evidence of her taking ways.
Brisbane has been disporting itself in new
garments at Ascot. Hilma Ohman wore an
embroidered net and a large hat massed with
the palest pink roses that Nature never
grew. Mrs. George Goodman, wife of the
J.C.W. manager, who is visiting Mrs. W. S.
Byrne, wore vieux rose foulard, and the Bell
bride —who was Rica Darvall —appeared in
an amethyst frock, which was the final word
in smartness.
On Tuesday last Mrs. Pinnock gathered
around her a number of the friends of
Dolores, and provided free tea and cake. The
decorations of the party, which gathered in
the Botanical Gardens, were the singer’s fav-
orite flowers, sweet peas.
On Monday the Mater Misericordise ball
committee sunned itself in the light of two
Excellencies, and, what was more important,
two dandmg ‘aides. Notwithstanding that
the ball was held on the sloping floor of the
Exhibition Hall, much youth and beauty
rolled up, and the anticipations of a well-
loaded cheque are not likely to be disap
pointed.
Two of our gilded youths who recently
visited Melbourne did not enjoy themselves
as much as they expected. One evening,
after supping with great determination, they
steered for home just about the hour old-man
Tima was unpacking a fresh day to hang on
the calendar. Then it was that youth No.
1 expressed a desire to master a new sara-
band, or two-step or war-dance, which youth
No. 2 willingly offered to expound. Half-
way through the lesson, however, one of Cal-
laghan's policemen, in the course of his duty
of evading burglars or something, fell upon
them and introduced them to the lockup.
Frantic appeals over the telephone broughr
help at last, and the indignant Law was
soothed into a proper frame of mind. It is
the last time, however, tne song-and-dance
artists will give their turn in public.
Yours affectionately, Australia Jane.

CAPILLARINE, bought a jar, and then, with alacrity, his moustache

NOTHING will keep a man at home and in good temper more than an Edison
Phonograph. It is the best attraction, because'it provides rational entertainment,
and is therefore the strongest competitor of the theatre, the club, or the
concert hall.
There is nothing that will furnish so much amusement for so many people so many
times and in so many ways as the Edison Phonograph.
As to variety and versatility—if you had a first-class band at your command, severed
leading platform singers on salary, two or three cbmedians to crack jokes and a
leading soprano; to sing ballads, you could not give the same amount of varied entertain-
ment that the Edison Phonograph gives by the simple expedient of changing records.
You can hear the latest successes by calling on the Edison dealer nearest you.
Write us for his address and lists of machines and records.

London illuminations on Coronation night
were utterly lacking in originality and
variety. In whole streets there was nothing
but a monotonous succession of “G.iv.'s”
and gas-jet stars. Frederick Harrison, who saw
Queen Victoria going to the Coronation 73
years ago, calls the scheme “tawdry” and
“stupid,” and declares that the smallest vil-
lave in Italy is capable of giving London
lesions in tins matter. What struck Harri-
son most on Coronation Day was the popu-
larity of the oversea representatives with
the crowd. At Queen Victoria’s Coronation
there was no visible indication of the exist-
ence of British colonies; and even at Ed-
ward's they were shown into a back seat. ,

TO THE FARMER,
the FERRO ENGINE has
proven itself an inestimable
boon by relieving him of the hard work about the
farm, such as pumping water, chaff and ensilage
cutting, bagging and hoisting, corn grinding, husk-
ing and shelling, sawing wood, separating cream,
driving winnowers or any machine for which
moderate power is required. Also on account of the
increased profit made by their use, which in many
cases has more than paid for the entire outfit before
the f rst season is over.
Drop a postcard to the nearest agent, giving par-
ticulars of machine or plant for which you require
power, and he will advise you of the most suitable
engine for the purpose. YOU WILL REMEMBER

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT A
‘SMOKE 1 IS TILL YOU’VE
TRIED MY CIGARS
Ouw\,
I’M going to have my Cigars smoked over every
part of Australasia—and the most confirmed
pipe-smokers are going to be the biggest
smokers of my Cigars, too.
Talk about joy! Why, to sit round a camp
fire, over a billy of tea, pitching to your mates,
each of you smoking one of my Cigars, joy isn't
in it! It’s just simply bliss!
As the yarns go round, the blue smoke
curling upwards in a fragrant cloud, the
smooth cool Havana flavor lingering on your
lips—l tell you, you'll spend some of the
happiest hours of your life.
rtyrty
Letters are coming in to
me in shoals from all over
Australasia, praising up my
Cigars. Take one I've just
got 'as I write this, for in-
stance —it’s from a chap on a
cattle station up in Northern
Queensland. He writes: — 1>
“Those PI \PEMAS Cigars
of yours are just alright. I’ve
always smoked' a pipe—blit
no more. Not that I’vegiven
up pipe-smoking altogether;
but when I want a real smoke
—something rich—l light up
one of your DIADEMAS,
and give myself up to its
pure enjoyment.”
To make you acquainted
with my Cigars, and prove
their value, I make you this
FREE OFFER of
5 or 6 CIGARS
you may select.
Send for 100 of any of
Remit the amount, and
I will deliver promptly,
postage or carriage paid,
to any address in Aus-
tralia.
Smoko 5 op 6 of them, and if they’re
not superior to most Cigars at double the
price, send the remainder back to me, and
I’ll return every penny of your money —no
charge made for the Cigars you’ve smoked.
My Cigars are made from the very finest
mild, rich mellow Tobacco, the filling or inside
heart of the cigar being all straight long
leaf. The Cigars are hand-made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before
it goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed
.to burn freely and draw easily.
There sno “catch" ab ut this offer—it’s just
plain and honest. To prove it, \ou can refer
as to rhy financial position and way of doing
business to the Manager of the Commercial bank
of Australia, Collins Street, Melbourne, He’ll
vouch for me.
Send down for a box to-day—once you smoke
them you 11 make it a ha’ it, and buy regularly
from me. When ordering, say whether you
like light, medium, or dark colors.

Australian verse-maker Wilfred Mailler,
who closed the book at Wilcannia (N.S.W.)
the other day, after an operation, had only
climbed to his 29th year. Those who knew
him six or eight years ago didn’t expect he
would either live or die in holy orders; but,
drifting out to Riverina, Canon Richards
got hold of him, and soon he was vicar of
Wilcannia. A memorial volume of his verse
is already in preparation.
Ernest Edward Lucy goes up perman-
ently to W. Thow’s place as chief of the
Motive Power Branch of the N.S.W. Rail-
ways. To him as organiser and supervisor
is mainly due the success which has marked
the building of new locomotives at the
Eveleigh railway workshops. Thow wasn’t
a State-construction man; his successor is.
Moreover, he is progressive and technically
well-equipped, and has oceans of initiative.
Speaking at Ballarat last week, Alfred
Deakin showed how fai; he has descended
since he fought the campaign that carried
Victoria into the Federation. “The old
spirit,” said he, “that gave Ballarat its pub-
lic monuments, gardens and pictures could
not be quite dead. He invited them to
direct it to three aims in order of sequence—
the welfare of Ballarat, of Victoria, and of
the Commonwealth.” Town pump first, a
district defined partly by arbitrarily-surveyed
lines second, and, last of all, Australia!
Yardmen and general rouseabouts em-
ployed at Westralian pubs have seen another
overtime scheme develop under the new
Groperland Licensing Act. Under that
measure, a penalty is provided for failure to
keep the bar closed after hours and on Sun-
days. The only person who may lawfully
muddle around among the pump and the
bottles during prohibited hours is the cleaner-
up. The consequence is, Yardman Bill is
cooped up from sharp on the tick of closing
time (11 p.m.), armed with his bucket and
mop, and, while sliding ouf nips and nob-
blers to night-owlers, makes-believe to be
cleaning-up. The “lurk” is proving a fine
get-out; but _as _ Yard-Barman Bill mostly
sustains no rise in screw, he is beginning to
think.
The country bleeds badly when parties
are so evenly divided that a vote or so
means the loss of office or the gaining of it.
Most politicians are honest, of course, but
there are a few who have their own ideas
about dishonesty. When James Martin was
in power, one of these was reported to be
hesitating on a close division. “Send him to
me,” said Martin. The uncertain one was
ushered into Martin’s office. “They tell me
you’re going to vote against the Government,
Blank?” said Martin. “Why, you were al-
ways one of our staunchest supporters ! We’ve
fed your .electorate up with bridges and
roads. What more do you want ? Don’t you I
like pur policy?” “No,” replied the con- 1
scientious one. “I don’t think it’s states-
manlike ; and I’m going to vote against you.”
‘‘Why/’ said Martin, “you d d, blank,
dash fool! If we go out, you’ll suffer. Do
you know that I was just about to sign the
papers to have that section of railway begun
which runs past your selection?” The doubt-
ful one rose, T and cordially shook hands with
Martin.. “Now,” he said with undisguised
admiration —“Now you’re talking like a states-
man. You can rely on my vote. The coun-
try is safe in your hands.”
“With the demand of the home markets
keeping in advance of the supply, and with a
prohibitive duty of Gd. per dozen on im-
ported eggs, Australia has not yet had to
seriously consider the export trade,” etc.
Ihis is written by Prain, the poultry expert
°f the Scottish Agricultural Commission, and
the S. M. Herald prints it with a chuckle of
satisfaction over the success of the poultry
industry in Australia. Still, on the next
page is the usual dreadful shriek at the idea
of a prohibitive duty on imported shoddy to
give the Australian manufacturer a like pros-
perity.
The S. M. Herald has been full of woe
over the sugar trouble and the threatened
general transport strike. It mourned like
this:—
. . . The fact that a dispute as to a living wage
for a few workmen cannot be settled without recourse
to alarums and excursions and threats and open vio-
lence and the menace of paralysis of a country’s
business is melancholy evidence enough of the in-
adequacy of our industrial relations to meet the
problems of to-day.
Well, what does the foolish old prattler ex-
pect i It lied to the public that the giving
of the powers asked for at the Referenda was
going to spread ruin and devastation, and the
public believed it. The Herald knew that
what was wanted was power to guard against
a trivial disagreement disorganising, “not
only the industry with which it is directly
concerned, but many and various industries
which are quite unrelated to it”; and now
that the beautiful results come home in an
expensive manner, what does the Herald
want to whine for? The “Noes” were look-
ing for trouble, and if they don’t get it this
time, they will next time. And whenever
they get it, they will only get what they
really asked for.
The Radicals of London are taking
N.S.W.’s ex-Governor Carrington to their
bosom. They entertained him recently at
lunchjeon, and offered him a bucket of bless-
ings. lie has been getting into their good
graces by cutting up not only his own
estates but such others as he could legally
reach, and encouraging the artisan and small
farmer to settle on them. “Charlie,” no
doubt, relishes the fuss, for he loves lime-
light as passionately as a beauty actor. At
heart, however, he always was generous;
but when he left off being human and
trusted to his official judgment, he was
nearly always wrong—and sometimes atro-
ciously wrong.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drurhs are invisible and comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them —the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from, deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who, have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee foi a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

Mothers Praise REXONA
THE wonderful healing properties of Rexona have made it a household
need and mothers universally declare it to be a necessity
in their homes, and many would not be without a pot of Rexona on
any accoumt.
In Rexona Ointment are combined juices and essences in an entirely
new and unique manner, forming a remedy justly celebrated for its won-
derful rapid cures.
ONE MOTHER SAYS:—
“My twin baby boy, now about six weeks
old, became covered with an obstinate rash
when about a fortnight old. The rash was
most pronounced on the head, arms and face.
About a week ago I obtained a tin of Rexona
Ointment and rubbed it on the child night
and morning. The pimples which made up the
rash were so close together that you could
not put a pin’s head between them, but they
began to go away almost at once, and now
they have all gone, and a new, smooth skin has
come. I find Rexona suits the tender skins of
babies splendidly, and is far away the best
thing I have yet come across.”
ANOTHER MOTHER SAYS:—
“My little boy had two sores
for over a month, one on his leg
and one on his nose, which were
very bad, although I took great
care of them and did everytning
to make them heal,” writes Mrs.
Martha Moore, 2 Adolphus Lane,
Balmain. “They did not im-
prove, and the sore on his nose
festered and looked very had.
Finally I was recommended to
try a pot of Rexona, which I did.
This Ointment cured these sores
in a very short time.”

My Morning Rose.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
the morning, when I waken,
VVhen the night is graveward taken,
And the dawn hangs on the hill-tops
with its pomp of bannered gold;
In the dew-time
vv , Hornes a true time
> nen my garden sings Hosannah as its per-
t tnmed choirs unfold !
In the morning—ah, the splendor
lit the sun-rise, flashing slender
oars ot light that swing triumphant as the
new-born planet glows ;
Tis no sad time—
T . Ah, tile glad time
\\ hen the dawn comes with the glory of my
fragrant morning rose!
v*ri° m my window, vine-leaf clustered,
a i n ie wol dd is newly lustred,
And the birds among the tree-tops sing their
glad epiphany ;
From my place there
I can trace tliere
Singing flowers that lift their antliem to a
Cod no man may see!
And the flower that singeth sweetest
Is the rose—ah, bud that greetest
Lod and Life with hymns seraphic whilst the
dawn-lift’s rapture shows,
Thou art splendid !
Doubt is ended
Y\ hen I hear the song exultant of my peer-
less morning rose!
Woven sunlight, flower of glory—
Red thou art as when the lory
I lashes tree-ward to the Bushland where
the wild things cageless are;
Passion’s flower —-
Ah, the hour
YS hen the buds are lightward breaking, and
their fragrant hearts unbar!
Bringest thou one thought regretful
To the soul that, once forgetful,
Lost the key that opens Heaven —key of joy
that ebbs and flows?
Nay. no grieving—
Faith is cleaving
In the hour that brings the splendor of my
radiant morning rose!
Yet and yet, when comes November
There’s a flower I still remember—
Flower of love that opened gladly in the
fragrant years that were;
Time brings sadness —-
Yet with gladness
Still I keep the thoughts unspoken—ah, the
heart’s own thoughts of her!
Who has loved has lived full measure—
Some there are who waste life’s treasure,
Some who leave life’s best behind them —ah,
the saddened heart that knows !
Just a woman,
Warm and human—
And I would dawn brought her kisses with
my mouth-red morning rose!
Wasted years of careless rapture
Come no more for man to capture—
“ Come no more!” My Morning Flower
lifteth now no lip to me;
Life is over
When the lover
Hears the heart that beats within him ring
the knell of Days To Be!
Yet and yet . . . the rose’s splendor
Comes again with fragrance tender,
And the earth new-weaves the glories that
lay dead at summer’s close;
Sin earns sorrow—
Shall To-morrow
Bring me back my one true woman, bring
me back my Morning Rose?
In the morning, shall I waken —
For the years have vengeance taken —
•Shalt the dawn upon Life’s hilltops hang with
pomp of bannered gold?
God, I care not —
For I dare not
F hen my garden breathes Hosannah, and its
fragrant choirs unfold!
Truest Heart —she knew the splendor
Of the dawn-lift: and 1 send her
Just a song to go before her as a faithful
lictor goes;
Let it take her
From the Maker
Just a breath of morning’s glory caught from
thee, my Morning Rose!

Burton’s Lung Cure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE’S our happy hunting ground,”
Burton called from the bow of
the ketch as he strained his eyes
until he could discern the line of foam on
the long, low reef, above which the tops of
the cocoa palms showed dimly against the
morning sky.
Leonard, his position at the wheel,
merely grunted in reply.
“I guess they’ll be on the look-out for us,”
Burton chuckled, with a twinkle in his eyes,
as he came aft.
“I reckon the Customs ’ll be on the look-
out for you,” the other growled. “I’m derned
glad you’re taking the whole risk in this
kick-np. It’s the rummiest cargo the old
Devon ever took aboard, and how anyone but
a maniac can hope to land it on the island
of Roonga beats me.”
Burton laughed heartily. He was not dis-
turbed in the slightest by his mate’s remarks,
for he knew Leonard to be a confirmed pessi-
mist, who had lost faith even in himself.
“The whole thing’s simplicity solidified,”
Burton assured him. “Haven’t I got proper
invoices, on wholesale chemists’ forms, and
isn’t the poison put up in neatly-labelled
medicine bottles? What I’d like to know is,
Who’s going to suspect it’s not Lung Cure?’’
ho but a born idiot would take Lung
Cure to Roonga ?” was Leonard’s retort. “It’s
the healthiest island in the South Pacific.
The air is capable of curing a consumptive
With both feet in the grave. The permanent
residents couldn’t raise a decent cough
amongst them. Even the dogs can hardly
P r mu U< I e a that accursed island.”
That was tl>3 longest speech Leonard had
ever been known to make, and it proved to
be his last protest concerning the sanity of
Burton’s enterprise.
j s ! aw L of P°°hga had been recently
annexed by Maonland, with the result that
the manufacture and importation of intoxi-
cating liquors had been prohibited. Roonga
was famous throughout the length and
breadth of the Pacific for the number of its
remittance men —exiles from England, who,
because of their excessive dissipation, had
been cast out by their families into the outer
darkness of the Southern Seas. They lived
mainly by means of the San Francisco mail,
and were, without exception, possessed of
thirsts unquenchable.
When Prohibition became law they were in
despair, for everything on the island, except
the lack of liquor, was delightful, and they
had no desire to leave a beautiful spot, where
living was of the cheapest, and work impos-
sible to find. \Ahile these remittance men
were wondering wliat they would do, Burton
suddenly butted in, and, with visions of a
huge profit floating before his eyes, went
across to Sydney. There he invested in a
consignment of cheap whisky, which he had
put up in medicine bottles, adorned with a
gorgeous label humorously describing the
contents as “Lung Cure.” The shipment
went by steamer to Raratonga, where, in
Leonard’s ketch, the Devon, it was tran-
shipped, under bond, for Roonga.
Burton’s hopes concerning the landing of
the cargo went down to zero when the Devon
swung into the tiny wharf. Jenkins, the
Collector of Customs, and the most confirmed
and suspicious Prohibitionist on the island,
was awaiting the tiny craft’s arrival. Bur-
ton had expected that Finnerty, the good-
natured assistant, would examine the cargo;
and, from past experience, he knew how Lo
deal with Finnerty. Jenkins was a different
proposition.
Burton, however, coolly handed up his
beautiful, faked invoices,- and observed casu-
ally that he supposed he could get busy land-
ing the goods.
Without uttering one word in reply, Jen-
kins began to examine the papers, and was
soon smiling suspiciously.
“Lung Cure?” he muttered. “What are
you bringing Lung Cure here for?”
“For the consumptives,” was the reply.
“Consumptives!” the official snapped.
“What consumptives are there here? The
Island of Roonga is the most blessed and
healthful spot on this planet. Lung disease
is absolutely unknown.”
“That’s just why they’re coming,” Burtor
retorted, lying manfully. “The Maoriland
Government,” he went on, his imagination
getting well under way, “has decided to estab-
lish an open-air sanitarium here for the cure
of consumptives. This Lung Cure is for the
patients, a shipment of whom will arrive in
about a week from new.”
“A shipment of consumptives to be dumped
here!” Jenkins shrieked. “Why haven’t I
been informed? It's monstrous! It’s in-
human! I .shall call a public meeting to
frame a protest!”
“In the meantime, I presume,” Burton sug-
gested, delicately, “I can put in my import
entry and start to land the cargo?”
The little Customs officer glared over the
rims of his. glasses, suspicion showing plainly
in his crafty eyes.
“I’m not satisfied,” was his verdict. “I
must see Finnerty.”
A native boy, who was fishing from the end
of the wharf, was despatched for the assist-
ant, and the long Irishman was soon on the
scene. The Collector then demanded eight
bottles of the Lung Cure, which were
promptly handed over.
“Take these to Dr. Dent,” Jenkins in-
structed, as he presented Finnerty with the
medicine,., “and get him to examine the con-
tents. If he cannot do so at once, or if the
task will occupy him longer than an hour,
return and let me know. I wish him to
make particular tests for any traces of alco-
hol. Patent medicines, I believe, frequently
contain that ingredient.”
Finnerty departed on his mission, and Jen-
kins sat down on some empty fruit cases to
continue his minute examination of the in-
voices. Burton sat on the stern rail of the
ketch and hoped that the doctor would be a
confirmed drunkard, who would give the
Lung Cure a good character.
An hour passed, and then Burton lighted
his pipe and ventured a question.
“Who’s this Dr. Dent, anyhow?” he in-
quired.
“A most worthy man,” Jenkins gushed.
“He is the magistrate and medical-officer
of the group, and lie lias worked unceasingly
to free these islands from the curse of liquor.
A most worthy man,”
Another hour dragged slowly by, and Bur-
ton sprang on the wharf.
“I guess while I’m waiting I might as
well go for a stroll,” he said.
His stroll took him straight to the Custom
House, which at first glance appeared to be
deserted. Curiosity prompted him to glance
into a small room off the main office, and
then the cause of the weary two-hours' wait
became apparent. Four empty medicine
bottles, conspicuously labelled, strewed the
floor; while, in one corner, snoring horribly,
lay Finnerty. It was evident that he had
tested the Lung Cure.
One glance at the prostrate form sufficed
for Burton. Closing the door softly, he
turned the key, and took the further pre-
caution of dropping it into liis pocket. The
necessity of prompt action was forced upon
him. He knew that as soon as Jenkins
learned the truth concerning the Lung Cure
the whole cargo would be confiscated.
He hurriedly hunted up two remittance
men, who in turn rounded up 10 others.
Money chanced to be plentiful, the mail hav-
ing arrived only three days before, so Burton
had no difficulty in collecting 10 dollars per
man. For this consideration he agreed to
run them across to a small island, 14 miles
from Roonga, which was not under the juris-
diction of the group.
When he returned to the boat he found
Jenkins in a state of great irritation because
of the prolonged absence of Finnerty. Within
10 minutes, however, Burton's friends began
to stroll casually down to the wharf in ones
and twos. All or them greeted him effusively;
and, having inquired after his health, stepped
aboard to have a chat. When the dofcefi had
arrived the moorings were smhh-nly cast off
and the vessel swung out from the landing
stage. As it drifted away Jenkins rushed
excitedly to the end of the wharf and shook
the invoices at the departing ketch.
“Where are you going?” he yelled.
“Bound for No Man's Land,” Burton made
answer, as he stood up in the stern. Then
he pulled out the key of the Custom House
and tossed it across to the Collector.
“I guess you'd better go and hunt up Fin-
nerty,” he advised.
A stiff breeze had sprung up off the land,

-2 YEARS A CRIPPLE !■
OBSTINATE WOUND ON FOOT
WHICH DEFIED ORDINARY TREATMENT.
MR. KEARNEY, who tells of the
wonderful benefits he derived from
Yam-Bak.
Another ZAM-BUK TRIUMPH.
MR. W. KEARNEY, of Carring-
ton Street, Rosalie, Brisbane,
says: “When living at
Toowoomba two years ago I jumped
a fence and landed on a sharp, pro-
truding stick, which ran right through
the fleshy part of my foot, causing a
nasty jagged wound. I suffered intense
pain, and the wound became so bad that
I underwent two operations, and for
about 18 months was walking about on
crutches. The left side of my body was
stiff and sore, and my entire system
seemed to be affected by the accident.
The doctor thought he had abstracted the
piece of twig from my foot, but the wound
kept exuding matter and caused me
much pain, anxiety and annoyance.
“ For two years 1 suffered, and during
that time 1 tried several ways to heal the
wound, but my foot was as bad as ever.
My brother-in=law had successfully used
Zam-Buk for piles, and he strongly re-
commended me to try this balm. I did
so, with gratifying results. Zam-Buk
quickly took out the pain and inflamma-
tion, and after using Zam-Buk for a little
time the piece of wood was drawn from
my foot. I continued using Zam-Buk,

and very soon the wound was completely healed,
and my leg, which was wasting away, regained its
natural proportions. My complete cure was en-
tirely due to Zam-Buk and to Zam-Buk alone.”

and the ketch was soon heading for the open
sea. The case of Lung Cure on deck at-
tracted attention, and the passengers were
not long in sampling its contents. The seal
of their approval came in loud demands for
a further supply, and, despite all protests, a
start was made on the cargo. When a case
was hoisted up from below Burton decided
that it was time he asserted his authority.
He saw plainly that trouble was brewing.
“Not another drop until we touch land,”
he decreed, as he prepared to swing the case
back into place. Leonard, who had lashed
the wheel, came for’ard to hack him up.
“There’s a blow coming,” the skipper de-
clared, pointing to a bank of black cloud
that _ was sweeping up from the east, “so
nothing more till it’s over. Then you can
drink yourselves blind if you want to.”
“That’s all right,” one of the party, known
as Big Ben, answered good-humoredly. “Any-
one can manage an old tub like, this.”
“Not another drop, I say!” Burton cried,
standing in front of the case.
“Come oh, boys!” Big Ben invited.
At the word, as if by a prearranged signal,
llie remittance men fell upon Burton and
Leonard, and carried them kicking and
struggling to the little cabin, where they
were securely shut in.
The vessel ran on before the wind that
every moment increased in force. Every-
one was too much absorbed in testing the
Lung Cure to bother about navigation. The
ketch ran on until, when Ben at last pro-
ceeded to take charge of her, she was many
miles out of her course and well away to
the west of her original destination.
Pie had just reached the wheel when the
full force of the storm struck the tiny craft.
Her sails were torn to shreds, and she was
driven helplessly before the rising gale. Big
Ben, who fortunately possessed sufficient
knowledge of the sea to keep the vessel be-
fore the wind, sobered up somewhat at this
crisis. He set his course straight for an
island that lay dead ahead, and within half
an hour there came into view a small bay.
Ben shifted the boat’s head just a trifle so
that she would make the entrance. Storm-
driven she rushed through the seething
water of the narrow pass. Ben’s muddled
brain, however, had failed to make him
aware of the treacherous half-circle of inner
reef that lay beyond the outer opening, and
the result was that, just as Burton and
Leonard succeeded in cutting their way out
of the cabin with an axe, the Devon crashed
on to the jagged coral, which cut her bot-
tom out below the water-line as cleanly as
if it had been done with a knife. The next
instant a great wave caught her broadside
on, and. slewing her round, left her upon
the beach.
Burton and his comrade in distress
succeeded in getting clear of the wreck
without much trouble, and in a rather damp
and dejecthd condition they crawled up the
beach until they reached the shade of two
cocoa palms. There they sat silently watch-
ing the determined efforts at salvage that
were being made by their late passengers.
.Of their location Burton had only the
faintest idea, but lie had hopes that they
might be in the track of some of the numer-
ous hookers that traded amongst the out-
lying islands. Leonard, as usual, was in-the
very depths of despair.
“I told you this outfit’d come to a violent
end,” he whined.
“That’s right!” Burton retorted, strug-
gling manfully to console him. “Do* the
hero act at this stage of the disaster by
lying down and dying. Show a hea.it, man!
Ponder on the fact that but for the fact
that you weren’t born to be drowned you
might now be shaking paws with David
Jones, Esq. Side-track your gloomy thoughts
and observe the magnificent example of in-
difference, in the very face of utter calamity,
that is being shown by our passengers.”
The remittance men were certainly bear-
ing up well. They succeeded in extracting
from the wreck 24 cases of the precious
Lung Cure, which they carefully stacked
up beneath a cluster of palms a few yards
above high-water mark. When evening
came on they built a huge log fire, around
which they sat and made merry. By mid-
night, when the moon rose above the
palm-fringed reef, there was a pile of empty
bottles at one side of the dying fire.
Stretched about on the sand, in every con-
ceivable attitude, the remittance men lay
sleeping heavily.
Burton and his mate decided to act. The
tide was out, so, one by one, they carried
the remaining cases of Lung Cure down to
the inner reef, and dumped them into nine
fathoms of water. They next turned their
attention to the wreck, which had been left
high and dry when the gale abated. The
only boat that the ketch carried had escaped
without injury, and after a lot of trouble
they lowered it over the side. They put a
quantity of provisions and a keg of water
aboard. Then they went back to their
palms and slept soundly until daybreak.
They awakened to find that the tide was
full and that the passengers were still
asleep.
“Guess we’d better leave for foreign parts
at once,” Burton suggested.
They had just reached the boat when one
of the sleepers stirred, and, sitting up, began
to rub his eyes. He rose to his feet, and
staggered with uncertain steps down to the
edge of the surf. For a few moments he
stood staring vacantly at Burton and Leon-
ard, who were making frantic efforts to push
the boat off. Then he seemed to realise
what was happening, and, with a wild cry,
he rushed into the water and tumbled over
into the bow of the boat just as it began to
move.
“Better take him to save trouble,” Bur-
ton advised.
The boat’s head swung round, and they
began to pull toward the break in the reef.
Once clear of the bay they hoisted the sail
and stood out on a long board toward a
cluster of tiny islands to westward. They
ran out on that tack for two hours, and
then, going about, they headed for a large
island supposed to be Nukululu, on which
there was an important mission station.
Another uneventful two hours went by. At
the end of that time Burton began to pick
out-different points on the island that were
familiar to him, and their course was
altered a little so as to enable them to make
a tiny bay to the north.
During the whole of the trip the stranger
had sat silent in the bow of the boat. Most
of the time his chin had been resting in the
palm of one hand while he gazed out across
the water with a far-away look in his eyes.
As Burton contemplated his profile from the
stern it occurred to him that the stranger
had a strikingly intellectual face. He had
a high forehead and finely chiselled features
that spoke eloquently of culture and refine-
ment.
When the boat had cleared the point and
the red-roofed mission station, nestling
amongst the palms, came into view, the
passenger turned slowly and surveyed his
two companions.
“Beginning to see things?” Burton in-
quired, sympathetically.
“I was just wondering why you lost your
nerve and bolted when the coast was clear, ’
said the stranger.
“Perhaps it’s only the after-affects,”
Leonard muttered.
“I’m the doctor’s assistant at Roonga,”
the stranger began to explain; “and when
Finnerty arrived with your Lung Cure the
stuff was turned over to me for a prompt
report. Dent himself isn’t capable of ana-
lysing a toothpick. I didn’t get past the
taste test with that stuff, and, after Fin-
nerty and I had absorbed a couple of bottles
each, I told Dent that the stuff was merely
a harmless lung mixture, and so Finnerty
was sent back with the remaining bottles
and a letter to the Collector giving the
•poison an excellent character. So far,
everything was going your way, and I was
just promising myself a night out, when a
friend dashed in and hastened me down to
your boat by telling me that a trip to an
outlying island was my only chance of a
spree. Why did you bolt?”
“Finnerty failed to return,” Leonard told
him. “He was found drunk in the Custom
House.”
“So the free pass I got you was wasted?”
the stranger said, sadly.
“And so was my Lung Cure,” said Bur-
ton, and then he spoke a long piece in the
curse language.
JOHN PATRICK.
The Wave.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I DREAMT a strange green dream of
many seas.
Within a dusk-enchanted ocean dell,
Deep at a palmy island’s purple knees,
’Mid coral branch, and weed, and rosy
shell,
I heard the calling of the master-breeze.
My soul awoke. From the white-sanded cave
The silver bubbles ran to kiss the light;
I. saw the morning on the waters brave,
League beyond league of billows crested
white.
And I, in pride of life, a wandering wave.
Dancing in boundless meadows of the deep,
I saw ten thousand brothers at their play ;
One lonely mountain islet seemed to sleep,
Shadowed against the shining morning
way,
With barrier reefs my spirit longed to leap.
Away! There shrilled a trumpet of the
wind
Out of the columned clouds that swept
the sky;
The serried ocean with a single mind
Turned all about me: white crests bent to
fly
Some elemental fear that rose behind.
Again the trumpet. Billows far and wide
Reared at the challenge, utmost curving
bows
Of pliant water. Down the screaming tide,
In long stampede, the thunder-footed rows
Tossed the blown spindrift from their necks
of pride.
Mad with the joy of that tumultuous race,
Stung with the salt whips of the smoking
sea,
I leaped, spume-dappied, to' the foremost
place
Amid the watery thunders. Over me
The angered cloud-rack showed a darkened
face.
On, on, on, on! I led the shouting gale
With speed that mocked the heavy foot of
day,
And made the dawning linger, rathe and
pale.
Always behind us. Rifts of white mist
lay
Upcurled before me like a shimmering veil.
I saw the windy morning lift the lace,
As with the reverence of a bridal hand,
To show the wonder of a shining space
Of sweet, wet forest fringed with yellow
sand,
And the clear beauty of a woman’s face.
I saw the rippling marvel of her hair,
Her dark, sweet eyes full of the summer
south,
Her shell-white foot and snowy ankle bare,
And the one happy rose that was her
mouth —
Dear God, the seas were cold, her face was
fair!
Trembling, I hung aloft my shadowy green,
Wild longing filled my veins with opal
fire,'
Flashing all lights; I felt my spirit lean,
Out, out, far out to touch my soul’s
desire.
Death! ... . But my lips shall kiss my
spirit’s queen.
O Death! The strife is done, the race com-
plete.
The yellow shore has hands to pluck me
down.
In thunders of white foam I run to greet
My clear dream of the morning. Oh, I
drown,
Broken and spent but I have held her
feet!
Back in the undersweep of endless seas,
I faint in dusks with swaying weed
a-stream :
Lost are the magic lights, the singing breeze ;
Cold scale and silver fin above me gleam,
The slow tides tremble. ... I am but of
these.
O soul, a-slumber in the white sand cave,
What of the morning full of happy light,
The spirit-woven dreams of strong and
brave,
The clamant voice of star-forsalcen night?
Ah, frail green wonder of the wandering
wave!
N.S.W.

10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness* itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair,
since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world— l am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cneapest.
