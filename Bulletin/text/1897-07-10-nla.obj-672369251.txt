BUT ALL HER TICS
.... THE STRONG INVAP6R BROKE,
and strong must be the invader who can root up fixed opinions, destroy old associations, and
.P^ himself firmly in the hearts of the invaded. When this is accomplished, not by strength
of numbers, but by force of merit, then the merit must be palpable indeed. The power is
potent, but it is pleasurable. The superiority of
CAMEO CIGARETTES
is evidenced by their popularity.
THE RED PAGE.
Somebody (a lady, of course) pays the Rec
Page a severe compliment. She says quite a lot
of good original verse has been printed the
lately .. . written by T. B. Aldrich. Well,
must be content to go slowly. After all, Ameri
has only one Aldrioh, and America has sixty-fi
millions of people. Who will wager that wh
Australia has so many she will not count h
Aldriches by the score ? Man for man, oui
poetical output is even now greater than that o
the United States. Dead-alive rhymers the;
have over there by the million; but of bare
touched with the divine fire, writhing in t
divine frenzy, you can name very few. If geni
■till exists in America it is orushed under t
weight of culture; and the Muse doesn’t care fo;
pancakes. With Whitman died the second o
America’s two great poets: the first wa
Poe. The remainder are mostly clever me
like Lowell, who write forcible verses
or cultured men like Longfellow, who wrx
tolerable verses with a popular and rathe
crude sentimental appeal; or pleasant rhyme
like Aldrich, who weave phrases tenderly ant
gracefully, and now and then strike a stron
ohord of humor or pathos. Two or three lik
Lanier and Miller display something of the tru
poetio energy, without making a sufficiently abic
mg impression to be called great. And for th
rest, there are dexterous versers like Scollard o
Gilder, or homely singers like Wilcox or Rile;
and thousands of others who among them con
trive to turn out millions of lines holding muo
that is interesting and felicitous and nothing at a
that is new or memorable.
* * * *
Yet Aldrich can only be depreciated by com
parison with the greatest. In virtue of pas
work, his is probably the name highest on the list
of living American poets ; though for the last te
years he haß written very little verse. To b
sore, he is sixty-one years old now ; and th
fount of fanoy cannot play for ever. There i
probably a good deal of truth in his history o
“The Flight of the Goddess,” recently printec
here. When he was young and struggling, h
Sublisbed book after book of poems—exquisitely
nished and tingling with emotion. Then a mi
lionaire became Aldrich’s patron, provided hi
income, and .finally died leaving the bulk of th
million to his children, and
... the Goddess had somehow flown.
Flown, and I fear she will never return ;
I am much too sleek and happy for her,
Whose lovers must hunger, and waste, and burn,
Ere the beautiful heathen heart will stir!
Some one has suggested that this poem gives the
lie to the Great Beefsteak Theory, which declares
that if you want an engine to work you must feec
the furnace, and if you want a poet to work you
must feed his brain with good rich blood. Bu
there is no opposition of ideas. The sweet uses
of Aldrioh’s ‘garret aloof ’ were not to starve him
but i;o isolate him, to concentrate him, and to
stimulate him with the knowledge that if hedidn’
work he wouldn’t get any beefsteak. It is pointed
out that Zola laid the foundation of his fame when
be was trapping sparrows for supper on the win-
dow-ledge of his garret. Precisely—thanks to
the vitality he got out of the sparrows.
* » * •
Aldrioh’s ‘ In an Atelier ’ has been often quoted
but not too much, perhaps, to hinder Außtraliai
reproduction—
IN AN ATELIER.
I pray you, do not turn your head ;
And let your hands lie folded, aa
It was a dress like this, wine-red,
That Dante liked so, long ago.
You don’t know Dante T Never mind.
He loved a lady wondrous fair—
HiS model ? Something of the kind.
I wonder if she had your hair!
I wonder if she looked so meek.
And wae no-t meek at all (my dear,
I want that side-light on your cheek).
He loved her, it is very clear,
And painted her, as I paint you.
But rather better, on the whole
(Depress your chin ; yes, that will do):
He was a painter of the soul!
(And painted portraits, too, I think,
In the Inferno - devilish good !
I’d make some certain critics blink
If I’d his method and his mood.)
Her name was (Fanny, let your glmce
Rest there, by that majolica tray)—
Wae Beatrice; they met by ohance—
They met by ohanoe, the usual way.
(As you and I met, months ago,
Do you remember? How your feet
Went crinkle-crinkle on the snow
Along the bleak gas-lighted street 1
An instant in the drug-store’s glare
You stood as in a golden frame,
And then I swore it, then and there,
To hand your sweetness down to fame.)
They met, and loved, and never wed
(All this was long before our time),
. And though they died, they are not dead—
Such endless youth gives mortal rhyme 1
Still walks the earth, with haughty mien,
Great Dante, in his soul’s distress ;
And still the lovely Florentine
Goes lovely in her wine-red dress.
You do not understand at all ?
He was a poet; on his page
He drew her ; and, though kingdoms fall;
This lady lives from age to age :
A poet—that means painter too,
For words are colors, rightly laid ;
And they outlast our brightest hue,
For varnish oraoks and orimsons fade.
The poets—they are lucky ones 1
When we are thrust upon the shelves^
Our works turn into skeletons
Almost as quickly as ourselves ;
For our poor canvas peels at length.
At length is prized—when all is bare!
** What grace ! ” the critics cry, “ what strength I
When neither strength nor grace is there.
Ah, Fanny, I am sick at heart,
It is so little one can do;
We talk our jargon—live for Art l
I’d much prefer to live for you.
How dull and lifeless odors are I
You smile, and all my picture lies I
I wish that I could crush a star
To make a pigment for your eyes,
Yes, child, I know I’m out of tune;
The light is bad ; the sky is gray:
I paint no more this afternoon,
So lay your royal gear away.
Besides, you’re moody—chin on hand—
I know not what —not in the vein—
Not like Anne Bulien, sweet and bland 1
You sit there smiling in disdain.
Not like Bluff Harry’s radiant Queen,
Unconscious of the coming woe.
But rather as she might have been,
Preparing for the headsman’s blow.
I see 1 I’ve put you in a miff—
Sitting bolt-upright, wrist on wrist.
How should you look ? Why, dear, as if—
Somehow—as if you’d just been kissed 1

H. 0. Bunner, whose death was noticed nol
long ago, perhaps comes as close to Aldrich as
anyone, and falls below hiir. less in art than in
energy. Bunner was a good type of the clever,
nervous man without quite enough vitality to dc
anything really great. Yet ‘ The Appeal to
Harold ’ is worthy to stand beside Aldrich’s besl
work. The poem is based on the tradition oi
a popular right of appeal to Harold of Normandy,
made by crying ‘Haro! Haro! Haro!’ In a
modified form, the practice is said to still survive
in some of the Channel Islands.
THE APPEAL TO HAROLD.
Haro I Haro !
Judge now betwixt this woman and me,
Haro !
She leaves me bound, who found me free.
.Of love and hope she hath drained me dry—
Yea, barren as a drought-struck sky ;
She hath not left me tears for weeping,
Nor will my eyelids close in sleeping.
I have gathered all my life’s-blood up—
Haro!
She hath drunk and thrown aside the cup
Shall she not give me back my days ?
Haro!
I made them perfect for her praise.
There was no flower in all the brake
I found not fairer for her sake ;
There was no sweet thought I did not fashion
For aid and servant to my passion.
L ibor and learning worthless were,
Haro!
Save that I made them gifts to her.
Shall she not give me back my nights?
Haro! , -
Give me sweet sleep for brief delights?
Lo, in the night’s wan mid I lie,
And ghosts of hours that are dead go by:
Hours of a love that died unshriven;
Of a love in change for my manhood given :
She caressed and slew my soul’s white truth,
Haro !
Shall she not give me baok my youth?
Haro ! Haro !
Tell thou me not of a greater judge,
Haro !
It is He who hath my soul in grudge.
Yea, from God I appeal to thee ;
God hath not part or place for me.
Thou who hast sinned, judge thou my sinning:
I have staked my life for a woman’s winning ;
She hath stripped me of all save remembering—
Haro I
Right thou me, right thou me, Harold the King !
* * • ' •
By the side of this Kipling’s recent ‘Vampire ’
verse is very feeble. (Judging by the reproduc-
tion in ‘ Blaok and White,’ by the way, Burne-
Jones’s picture is feeble too—a forceless oopy of
idealess models.)
* * * *
Bunner is at his best in serious mood, yet his
lighter vein is delightful. E.g. —
FORFEITS.
They sent him round the circle fair,
To bow before the prettiest there.
I’m bound to say the choice he made
A creditable taste displayed ;
Although—l can’t say what it meant—
The little maid looked ill-content
His task was then anew begun—
To kneel before the wittiest one.
Once more that little maid sought he,
And went him down upon his knee.
She bent her eyes upon the floor—
I think she thought the game a bore.
He circled then—his sweet behest
To kiss the one he loved the best.
For all she frowned, for all she chid,
He kissed that little maid, he did.
And then—though why I can’t decide—
The little maid looked satisfied.
* * * *
R. K. Munkittrick, one of the best-known con-
tributors to ‘ Puck ’ during Bunner’s editorship,
recently published a book of verse from which two
quaint items were the other day thankfully bor-
rowed. ‘ R.K.M. ’is never serious : he is always
gambolling in the manner of a diluted Calverley,
and playing all sorts of pranks with phrase and
fancy. The method of ‘ Unsatisfied Yearning ’is
Very like that of the quoted ‘Put to Sleep.’
UNSATISFIED YEARNING.
Down in the silent hallway
Scampers the dog about.
And whines, and barks, and scratches
In order to get out.
Once in the glittering starlight,
He straightway doth begin
To set up a doleful howling
In order to get in.
* * * •
And here is another ‘ R.K.M. ’ ballade, with a
full N’York flavour—
BALLADE OF TRIUMPHANT TIME.
Oh, time is ever upon the wing,
It flies like a gull o’er the shining sea;
It gathers the white bloom of the spring,
And the immature apple upon the tree ;
It gathers all matter from A to Z.—
From the trouser’s seat to the lamb of May ;
Oh, time is fleeting in ruthless glee—
To-morrow, to-day will be yesterday.
Where is last Summer’s engagement ring?
Where is last Summer itself, and she?
Mosquito, mosquito, where is thy sting?
New Jersey, oh where is thy victoree ?
The plumber must crumble, ah me, ah me t
Like snow he must fade from the earth away I
No purse can imprison the green-winged V:
To-morrow, to-day will be yesterday.
Not long to the skull can the front hair cling—
The reaper is swinging his scythe care-free,
One day doth the bird in the garden sing,
Then akimbo on Annabel's hat is he ;
To time all subjects must bend the knee ;
All beauty must dwindle in slow decay ;
All flesh is grass and some grass is tea :
To-morrow, to-day will be yesterday.
ENVOI.
Prinoe, even the Presidential Bee,
A frost benumbs in the sunny ray;
Our idols fall and our shekels flee—
To-morrow, to-day will be yesterday.
* * * •
Col. John Hay, the new American Minister at
London, is best known by ‘ Jim Bludao,’ ‘ Little
Breeches,’and similar ballads. To anon-American,
these seem rather crude and stagey, and the
cheap-sentimental appeal is repeated over and
over again, as in ‘ Golyer ’ —
Ef the way a man lights out of this world
Helps fix his heft for the other sp’ere,
I reckon my old friend Golyer’s Ben
Will lay over lots of likelier men
For one thing he done down here.
You didn't know Ben ? Hedrivastage
On the line they called the Old Sou’-west:
He wa’n’t the best man that ever you seen,
And he wa’n’t so ungodly pizen mean, —
No better nor worse than the rest.
He was hard on women and rough on his friends,
And he didn't have many, I’ll let you know ;
He hated a dog and disgusted a cat,
But he’d run off his legs for a motherless brat,
And I guess there’s many jess so.
I've seed my sheer of the run of things,
I’ve hoofed it a many and many a miled,
But I never seed nothing that could or oan
Jest get all the good from the heart of a man
Like the hands of a little child . . .
* * * •
Of course, familiarity with scene and people and
dialect counts for a great deal in appreciation of
suoh work. A Canadian to whom a copy of
Lawson’s verse was sent declared that he could
see nothing at all in the swag-ballads. And he
was quite sure ‘ the form is disgustingly rough.’
Yet to an Australian these seem often full of life
and color—just because he is Australian ; while
the blemishes may become beauties by dint of
ardent contemplation. There is a pregnant story
of a man who was annoyed into green and yellow
melancholy by a mole on his wife’s lip. But, willy-
nilly, he saw it every day; he became used to
it; he became enamoured of it ; and at last he
would kiss nowhere else.
* * » •
But Hay has another vein—the Bunner-and-
Aldrich vein—with rarely enough skill to mine it
properly. ‘ The White Flag ’is his best result in
this kind—
THE WHITE FLAG.
I sent my love two roses—one
As white as driven snow,
And one a blushing royal red,
A flaming Jacqueminot.
I meant to touch and test my fata;
That night I should divine, i
The moment I should see my love, l
If her true heart were mine.
For if she holds me dear, I said,
She’ll wear my blushing rose ;
If not, she’ll wear my cold Lamarquo
As white as winter’s snows.
My heart sank when I met her : sura
I had been over bold,
For on her brea&t my pale rose lay
In virgin whiteness cold.
Yet with low words she greeted me.
With smiles divinely tender ;
Upon her cheek the red rose dawned,—
The white rose meant surrender.
* • * •
Someone recently quoted for The Bulletin one
of Hay’s often-quoted distiches, slightly altered—
As the meek beasts in the Qarden came orawliug for Adam
to name them,
So men and women to-day orawl to the feet of a Queen.
Here are others—
DISTICHEjS.
Wisely a woman prefers to a lover a man who neglects
her.
This one may love her some day, some day the lover will
not.
There are three species of oreatures who when they seem
coming are going :
When they seem going they come; diplomates, women
and crabs.
What is a first love worth, except to prepare for a second?
What dots the second love bring? Only regret for the
first.
Wine is like rain: when it falls on the mire it makes it
the fouler,
But when it strikes the good soil wakes it to beauty and
bloom.
Maidens! why should you worry in choosing whom you
shall marry ?
Choose whom you may, you will.find you have got some-
body else.
Unto each man comes a day when his favorite sins all
forsake him,
And he complacently thinks he has forsaken his sins.
True luck consists not in holding the best of the cards at
the table ;
Luckiest he who knows just when to rise and go home.
Pleasant enough it is to hear the world speak of your
virtues ;
But in your secret heart ’tis of your faults you are proud.
Try not to beat back the current, yet be not drowned in
its waters;
Speak with the speech of the world, think with the
thoughts of the few.
Make all good men your well-wishers, and then, in the
years’ steady sifting,
Some of them turn into friends. Friends are the sunshine
of life.

To the making of a poet go brain, energy, and
education—corresponding with seed, soil, and
tillage. (Education would refer chiefly to sense of
form, taste, premeditated art, &c.) And an ex-

quoted—Shakespeare and Poe being included for
the sake of a relative standard—

SURGEON LANGSTON, M.R.C.S., Eng.,
THE GREATEST AND MOST SUCCESSFUL PRACTI-
TIONER IN THE WORLD.
But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-emin-
ence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston, a
resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Melbourne.
His name has become almost literally a household word ;
almost every other man you meet has a wonderful story to
relate of some almost miraculous cure he has performed
in an acute or chronic case of long standing, where other
physicians have failed. He addresses himself in particular
to cases that have baffled the skill and science of other
doctors. His name is a sufficient guarantee of a perfect
cure of every case he undertakes. Consult him this day.
It may save you much mental and physical suffering, and
add golden years to your life.
YOUNG MEN. You will find this distinguished doctor
your best friend and benefactor. If you are troubled
with want of sleep, a tired, gloomy feeling, and loss
of energy, which impair both your body and brain,
and absolutely unfit you for study, business, or the
proper enjoyment of life ; if you are suffering from these
or similar symptoms you know the cause. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE-AGED MEN. There are many of you afflicted
vyith weak, aching back and kidneys, loss of mental and
ph'ysical power and vigor, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated
that in all such cases of middle-aged men, as well of
young men, his success has been almost invariable.
Troubles of every kind, name and nature, treated far in
advance of any institution in Australia—female com-
plaints, liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, bladder,
kidney and heart disease ; rupture, piles, fistula, hydrocele
and kidney troubles.
VARICOCELE. Surgeon Langston’s Electric Quadrant
with double compress, price £2. Constitutional or
acquired weaknesses treated successfully.
CONSULTATION is free to all, but where £1 is
enclosed a careful diagnosis of the case will be made, and
appropriate medicines sent. Before confiding your case
elsewhere, consult the old and successful Specialist,
SURGEON LANGSTON. A friendly letter or call may
save future suffering. New edition of my latest work,

whose New and Scientific Treatment, by purifying and
enriching the blood, gives new life and tone to the
whole nervous and muscular systems, and builds up a
new constitution in the most enfeebled. The first week of
treatment brings glad relief, and PERSEVERANCE
ensures a thorough and LASTING CURE.
MEN
Should try Dr. SPEER’S celebrated Remedies, which strike
at the root of the disease. The symptoms gradually dis-
appear, vigor and lost health return, sunken eyes retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.
ALL CONSULTATIONS FREE.
Persons residing at a distance can, by describing their
troubles in detail, be treated at home. The course of
treatment will not in any way interfere with their
business.
Every person applying to the Doctor will receive a
straightforward and candid opinion of the case, and the
possibility of a cure. If the patient is curable, he will tell
him so ;if not, he will also tell him. He undertakes no
case which he cannot cure.

Z)r. GIBBOXS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
Private, Nervous and Skin Diseases.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fa c.,
&e., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.

All cases are treated strictly confidentially.
In publishing the following remarkable state-

letters and particulars of cases being destroyed

Mr. J. H. WE-HR, PARMER,
WASLEYS, S.A. writes:—" I can-
not refrain from adding my testi-
monial to your numerous list. In
justice to science, humanity, and
yourselves I must say that your
treatment of sorrowful afflictions is
past all belief. For seventeen years
I have been a sufferer, and four
months ago 1 went from bad to
worse ; in fact lost all hope of ever
being well again. When I visited
you I was at once placed under a
course of treatment entirely new to
myself, and from the first I was able to attend to my
occupation as farmer. lam happy to state that lam now
well and better than I have been for years, but shall
follow your advice and take the remedies for some time to
do away with all risk. 1 shall always remain indebted to
you for my wonderful cure.”
ANTHONY BARRY, Castle Inn,
Hindley-street, Adelaide, writes :
“ I will be glad if you will publish
the following for the benefit of suf-
ferers. For the last five years I
have been in the West, having
worked from Lake Darley to the
Horse Shoe Bend in Murchison.
Nearly the whole of the time I have
been a sufferer from Debility,
and loss of energy, always moping
q|
1
alone, afraid to join in any
conversation, noises in the ears, and other symp-
toms too numerous to mention ; in fact, was a nuisance
to myself and mates. Tried many advertised remedies
without obtaining any relief. On my way to New Guinea,
and hearing of so many from the West on their way to
other colonies breaking their journey at Adelaide to
obtain your treatment, I decided to do the same. I am
glad to say I now feel fit to continue my journey without
fear, and am sure I have only to take your remedies a
little longer to obtain a thorough cure. lam well known
in all parts of the West, and write this that my mates and
others may know where they can obtain a certain cure.”
Mr. M. J. DENAHY, Beryl
Street, Broken Hill, writes: —
“ Your remedies have acted
like magic in my case, having
been a sufferer for months
from weakness, and through
weakness I was so ill that I
had to give up work, and I
say truthfully I never thought
I should ever regain my
strength, as I took so much
medicine before seeing you
and without feeling the
slightest bit better, when
fortunately I met a patient of
yours, Mr. J. Kent, who
advised me to lose no time,
and, using his own words, he
said: ‘The only chance you
have is to go to Brunswick, Hamilton & Co., who will
very soon put you right,’ and I am thankful I took his
advice, for since I took your remedies 1 am as well and as
strong as ever 1 was in my life. 1 cannot thank you suffi-
cient for what you have done for me.”
REMARKABLE CURE OF DEBILITY.
Mr. J. W. AITCHISON, 22 North-st., Adelaide, writes:
—“ Gentlemen,—l cannot refrain from adding my testi-
mony to your extraordinary and most marvellous treat-
ment of one of the worst cases of Debility such as mine
was. Since being under your care I can safely say that I
am a strong man once more, and the distressing symptoms
from what 1 was suffering from have all disappeared in a
most miraculous manner. I had previously been under
the care of five different practitioners for the past four
years ; purchased three different galvanic or electric belts,
without deriving any benefit whatsoever. I had given up
all hope of ever being myself again, when I was recom-
mended to see you. In two weeks’ time I began to feel
improvement, and your remedies did more for me than
the whole four years’ treatment with others. I feel as if
I can never thank you enough, and, as I should like other
sufferers to know what yon have done for me, make what>
ever use you like of this.”
JOSEPH MARTIN, Cen-
tral Mine, Broken Hill,
writes :—“ Accept this tes-
timonial in recognition for
the valuable services you
have rendered me by per-
forming a wonderful cure of
my case, which has been on
me for over five years, and
now that I am well and tell
you that I spent over A‘2oo
before consulting you, and
deriving not a farthing’s
worth of benefit from emin-
ent men makes my case one
that other sufferers should
hear about, so that they can
be treated and cured as I am,
and also made strong,
I
healthy, and happy, which I never thought could be done
until I was a short time under your care. I could con-
tinue for months writing of the misery and anxiety which
I have suffered, and it makes this testimonial one of great
value not only to you, but also to those who may be
sufferers like I was, and those that read this and will take
my advice and place their case in your hands will not only
thank you, but also me for making it known to them.

EUCHRE.
What death could Antonine’s surpass,
Who, to the soldier at his side,
Gave the word “ Aequanimitas,”
And turned unto the wall, and died ?
Perhaps he said it, though I fear
Too oft some writer’s facile pen
And sense of fitness make appear
The apt remarks of dying men.
I hate to think that in a screed
A man should fable, for witli me
The truth is precious—as indeed
So rare a thing deserves to be.
But men there are who undergo
The last reprieveless sentence grim
With even spirit; this I know
By best of proof—for there was Jim.
For Jim when dying did not raise
Regrets, or build up hopes ornate :
He summed it all up in a phrase :
“ Ah, life’s a game of euchre, mate.”
The last grains sank within his glass,
And, while his breath came hard and slow,
He murmured faintly, “ Mate, I pass,”
And I responded, “ It’s a go.”
Of course, to nicely round the tale,
Jim ought to “ gag ” with every groan,
And murmur ere his soul set sail
(Soft music, please), “ I’ll go alone.”
But I’ve for Truth a love absurd,
And so I tell the yarn, you see,
Exactly as the thing occurred —
Yes, just as it occurred to me.

CONSOLATION.
Came a man to Mary Casey,
In her hut at Malden Camp,
Saying, “ Mary—now, be aisy—
But poor Casey’s gone on tramp. ”
“ Och? go plumb,” said Mary, scolding,
With a glitter in her eye,
“ To the place where they’ll be holding
Yez on griddles when yez die;
Yah ! go aisy wid yer lyin’—Micky gone on tramp,
you say ?
Shure, it’s me that knows he hasn’t, for he cud n’t
get away.”
Then the man who brought the tidings
Simply stood and gasped for breath ;
Stricken dumb by Mary’s chidings,
Feared to tell of Michael’s death.
“ But, say, Mary,” said he, crying,
When at length he found his voice—
“ Michael’s dead. There’s no denying :
’Twas a case of Hobson’s choice ;
He was loading in the cutting, and was just agoin’
to ‘ tamp ’
When he dropped dead of a suddent. Yes, poor
Michael’s gone on tramp.”
“ Wirra ! Wirra ! ” moaned the mourner,
(“ Ah ! Poor Michael! ” sighed the man)
‘ ‘ That’s his best suit in the corner ”
And her tears to flow began—
“ And he’s left me, och ! the villin,’
And he niver said ‘ Good-bye ’ —
. To forget him I’d be willin’ —
Sure I’ve half a mind to thry.
You’re his size ? Go aisy, sonny—sure ye’re foolin,
nothin’ more ?
Ye’re in earnest? Come in, darlint—hang yer
hat behind the door. ”

WHEN MOTHER CALLS TO DINNER.
We’re on a farm not far from town—
There’s just a dozen acres ;
Our neighbors range from atheists
And infidels to Quakers ;
We’ve got the good old pious sort
’Long-side the hardened sinner—
But that won’t spoil our appetite
When Mother calls to dinner.
When, years ago, we started first
And did the pioneering—
The fencing and the breaking-up,
The stumping and the clearing—
If stuck at some old ironbark
Which looked a likely winner,
We always got our courage up
When Mother called to dinner.
We’ve had some floods, when weeks of rain
Have given us a notion
We’d wake some day and find the place
Adrift towards the ocean ;
And then such droughts and failing crops
As daunt the green beginner !
But still we fought and struggled on,
And Mother called to dinner.
So though the droughts may scourge the land,
Or floods roar like a river,
We’ll hope that better times ’ll come—
The bad can’t last for ever !
And though the worry and the care
Are making Dad grow thinner,
There’s always hope of winning yet
While Mother calls to dinner.

THE BICYCLE’S GONE TO THE BUSH.
It’s all up a tree with the swagmen,
It’s all over now with the tramp,
And the horsemen can dally with bagmen,
For they’re wanted no more on the camp.
They’re trooping in droves from the west-track,
With tidings of woe to their push,
For the inside, they say, is the best track,
Since the bicycle’s gone to the bush.
In old times we went to the city,
With a tidy old cheque to knock down ;
We’d muse on the beauties of Kitty
As we lit from the lights of the town ;
We had only to steer for the back-blocks
Again in a while to be flush—
Now it’s ai! for our youth and our black-locks,
Since the bicycle’s gone to the bush.
On the stations out back they are riding
’Long bound’ry and rabbit-proof fence ;
And rouseabouts swiftly are gliding
With shearers and tank-sinkers hence ;
They’re rounding-up sheep and scrub-cattle,
They stem the most desperate rush —
E’en the myalls will pedal to battle
On the bikes that have gone to the bush.

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Price HitliertO Ull“
known Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Yuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas:
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d.ll— will at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.*

Five Tears of Socialism.
Maoriland, unlike the other provinces of
Australasia, takes its census every five years,
and the one just completed practically covers
the 1 era of its semi-socialistic State policy.
It extends over most of the period since the
Ballance-Seddon combination began to run
riot, and to do things in the name of Liberal-
ism which caused the aggregate hair of the
aggregate Fat Man of all the seven Aus-
tralias to stand up in horror. During that
period Maoriland has been, in the eyes of
the orthodox capitalist, the shocking example
of Australasia. The heavy feet of Seddon
and M‘Kenzie have stepped, not lightly
either, on almost all the idols of Respecta-
bility. “ Freedom of contract ” has been so
badly wrecked that even the fragments of it
are hardly to be found, and that other fetish,
the "‘liberty of the subject,” has not been
dealt with at all kindly. Also “private
enterprise” has been knocked out in one
round through the Government taking a
hand in all manner of things with which,
according to the opinion of solid financial
magnates, it had no possible right to inter-
fere. Maoriland, in short, has followed a
policy which has been one long outrage on
that kind of orthodoxy which consists
mostly in reconstructing and issuing inter-
minable “ B” debentures. It is strongly and
rigidly Protectionist, which it shouldn’t be
for the obvious reason that Britain isn’t
Protectionist, and all pure commercial mora-
lity is made in the land of J. Bull. The
province has been run for six years by what
is practically a Labor Ministry, and it has
been proved over and over again that such a
thing is a mere rushing down a steep place
into the sea. And its tendency to “ dabble ”
in Socialism is the crowning iniquity and the
last stage on the road to ruin.
* * *
It was understood any time within the
last six years that these accumulated evils
were' fast “driving capital out of the
country.” Also, by reason of the inevitable
driving of capital out of the country it was
held that industry must necessarily become
paralysed, and through the paralysis of in-
dustry that the population must begin to
shift bodily to more promising fields. So
far, however, as the information goes, none
of these events has happened up to date.
In five years the population increased by
76,709, which means, roughly speaking, an
increase of 60,000 by the preponderance of
births over deaths, and 16,000 by the
influx of strangers escaping from coun-
tries where freedom of contract is still
in a good state of preservation. In
proportion to population, this increase is
a shade better than the Australian average,
even with the great Westralian boom
reckoned in. And apparently this popula-
tion has still some visible means of support.
The value of manufactured goods turned out
in 1896 was millions as compared with 8f
millions in 1891 ; the number of factory em-
ployes increased in five years from 25,663 to
27,389, and this during a period when both
New South Wales and Victoria showed a
serious decrease ; and out of 69 leading in-
dustries only 16 are not distinctly progres-
sive. Manufacturing industries, as a rule,
are evil-smelling and unpoetic affairs, and
their tall brick chimneys are a blot on the
landscape ; still their increase is a sure sign
of material prosperity. No community ever
came to much by merely tearing raw pro-
ducts out of the ground and sending them
abroad, and by humping foreign - manu-
factured goods ashore from foreign vessels in
exchange.
• « * *
The last five years have been years of ex-
cessive cheapness. The cause of this is
variously set down as mono-metallism, over-
competition, the introduction of new me-
chanical processes, the opening up of new
countries, the want of orthodox piety and a
neglect to put the usual threepence in the
plate, a godless system of education, and
many other things. But, while causes are doubt-
ful, the result is absolutely certain. Prices
in 1896 were so much lower than they were
even in 1891 that it was quite possible to
turn out a great deal more produce, and yet
the aggregate value to be a great deal less.
An increase of £750,000 in the value of local
manufactures meant a notable expansion of
Maoriland industries, and, considering that
this result was arrived at in the disastrous
period when two out of the country’s three
banks came to awful disaster, and its other
biggest financial institution did likewise, and
when the Australasian boom-bubble definitely
burst, it shows that there is much vitality in
the land of Labor-Ministries and State-
Socialism, and other “ reckless experiments.”
And, notwithstanding the general cheapness,
wages in Maoriland shared very little
in the downward tendency, which has
been so marked in Australia. Out of 26
industries, of which full details are given, 12
show a distinct reduction in the average rate
of wages, one is about stationary, and 13 ex-
hibit a marked increase. One good old fiction
which is badly exploded by the census-returns
is that the male worker is being ousted from
a large number of industries by the inrush
of female competitors. In one solitary Maori-
land industry out of 26—the printing trade—
this has been the case to some extent; that
is to say, there has been a small increase in
the number of female employes, accom-
panied by a considerable decrease in the male
compositor. In two other trades women
have dropped out altogether during the last
five years, and in three more the male workers
have increased, while the female ones have
grown fewer, while in the rest the workers
of both sexes have increased or decreased
simultaneously.
* • » *
On the whole, however, though they have
not begun to drive men out, the female
workers of the factories and workshops are
increasing faster than the males in Maori-
land as well as in all the other provinces.
This result is inevitable, and no fiscal policy
that it is possible to devise seems likely to
alter it. The female population, which was
at one time a very small affair, is getting to
be practically an even half of the community.
While women are increasing the proportion
of marriages is diminishing, not only in these
provinces but almost all over the world,
therefore the proportion of women who have
no male support, and who have to hustle for
a livelihood in whatever occupations will
yield the necessary crust, is constantly
becoming greater, and seems as if it might
increase almost indefinitely. In the Maori-
land factories during the last five years the
male workers have increased by 322 and the
females by 1434, which is a striking dispro-
portion. Yet, in defiance of all accepted
theories, the male factory operative is a good
deal better paid on the whole than he was
five years ago, while the female one on the
Avhole is paid a good deal worse. Taking
the two classes together, however, the rate
of wages has remained almost exactly the
same. Apparently, therefore, the province
of socialistic experiments has made greater
advances, so far as its industries are con-
cerned, during the last five years than any of
the other Australias ; it is the only one
where wages have not diminished; capital
has apparently been accumulating instead of
being driven out; and the inrush of the
enfranchised woman into all manner of
industries has not produced any disastrous
results so far, except, perhaps, to the
enfranchised woman herself.
♦ * • *
Maoriland and Westralia are the only pro-
vinces out of the seven which are not bur-
dened with a huge accumulated deficiency.
Maoriland is the only one which, for eight
consecutive years, has shown a sufficient
surplus of exports over imports to cover
interest on its foreign debt, and it is the only
province which, for a number of years, has
contrived to pay a material part of its public
works expenditure out of revenue, instead of
shunting it all on posterity. Also, its pas-
toral, agricultural, and mining industries all
show a material improvement as compared
with their condition at the beginning of the
present decade. Certainly, there has been
nothing great or gorgeous about the im-
provement, and Maoriland, like many other
places, has been a bad country to live in dur-
ing the past series of lean years. But, so far
as all the available evidence goes, it has been
the best of seven lean provinces, whereas,
according to that financial orthodoxy which
consists so largely in going broke and issuing
“ B” debentures, it ought to have been the
very worst. It is now over six years since
the Democratic party became dominant, and
the large land-owner, and the proprietor of
innumerable homed cattle, and the whole-
sale draper, and the company-monger and
bank-wrecker ceased to run the political
machine, and all that time the air has been
full of jeremiads from these persons about the
irreparabledisasterwhichmustensue. If there
was anything in that dismal tale, Maoriland
should be the most insolvent province of the
seven. Yet, though its finance has not been
wholly honest, or its Government wholly in-
telligent, it is in the main a shade more pros-
perous than the best of its neighbors.
Every one of the Australias has been a
reasonably good place to be away from during
the last seven years, but no one of them has
stood the strain so well as Maoriland.
State Insurance in Victoria.
Probably the most unsatisfactory act in the
career of Isaac Isaacs, Victorian Attorney-
General and Acting-Premier, so far as that
astute lawyer has yet gone, is his decision to
appoint a commission “ to inquire into the prac-
ticability of State or municipal fire insurance.”
Commissions in general are an expedient for
passing on the responsibility, or devising com-
promises and half-measures, or smothering the
subject under an avalanche of verbiage. They
consist generallyof politicians who are instructed
to inquire into something they know nothing,
or less than nothing about; therefore the com-
mission has to educate itself as it goes along.
It educates itself by getting evidence from
people who know nothing about the subject,
from people who know a little about it, from
people who know all about it, but whose inte-
rest it is to obscure the issue and lead the com-
mission astray, and from other people. The
commission, as a rule, doesn’t know enough to
tell one of these varieties of people from another,
and the results, in most cases, are delay and
expense, and a vast amount of print, and very
little else.
* • f *
The commission which is to consider the State
fire insurance idea can’t begin with any practical
knowledge of the subject, for there is no com-
prehensive system of State fire insurance at
present in existence anywhere from which
knowledge can be gathered. Therefore it starts
with no special fitness for its work. It will pro-
bably take great masses of evidence, but as there
is no comprehensive State insurance system
for its witnesses to supply information
about, they can’t tell it anything in particular
of a practical character. The majority of them
will probably be experts who will talk about
fire insurance in general, and, as an insurance
expert, in 99 cases out of 100, is a business
gentleman in a bell-topper who earns his crust
by bossing a private insurance office, and whose
business and salary will be destroyed when the
State takes to the work in real earnest, they
will naturally be almost unanimous in condemn-
ing the idea. The only expert who doesn’t con-
demn the idea will probably be the one who
expects to get a billet as superintendent of the
new department. If the experts are friendly,
all they can tell the Commission is that the way
to run a fire-insurance office is to charge enough
premiums to cover losses, and to keep a sharp
look-out on customers whose noses are hooked,
and whose eyes are too close together, and
whose burnt premises smell too strongly of
kerosene. None of them could tell what per-
centage of the premiums it would cost to run a
universal system of compulsory insurance, or
anything else about it, for none of them ever
did run anything of the kind. If they could
tell it is tolerablv certain that they wouldn’t.
• ' * * *
What the Commission already knows is that
insurance at present Victorian rates would pay
if expenses were largely reduced; if expenses are
not reduced then insurance at present rates
won’t pay. They can’t be reduced while about
40 companies are trying to live on the game,
and have to keep up all their offices and staffs
and managers, and give heavy commissions,
and pay 40 different rents and advertising bills,
out of the business to be done in a community
of a million people. If State insurance was
made compulsory there would be one office and
one set of branch offices and agencies instead
of 40, and the saving to be effected thereby is
too apparent to require demonstration in 240
pages of printed evidence. If State insurance
was made compulsory there would be no need
to pay heavy commissions to agents as an in-
ducement to tout for business, and the fact that
not paving commission would be cheaper than
paying" it is also sufficiently obvious. The
State wouldn’t want 10 per cent, dividends on
capital, and that saving is visible to the naked
eye. Further, it could start with no capital
save the amount required to set the scheme
going; if it struck some heavy losses at the
outset before a sufficient amount of premiums
had accumulated to meet them, the Treasurer’s
guarantee that the needful sum would
be advanced would be quite as good
as a paid-up capital of five millions. The
State is the one insurer that could start
the business without a large amount of ready
money, and it is hardly necessary to demon-
strate the economy to be thus effected. And
as the capital of a Victorian Insurance Depart-
ment would be about .£350,000,000 —in other
words, it would be the entire assets and credit
of the province—it could obviously undertake
single-handed the biggest risk in the province,
as it would be about ten times as strong as all
the 40 private offices in Victoria put together.
No evidence is likely to throw additional light on
any one of these essential points.
• * » *
The questions about which information is
really wanted are: Whether the proposed fire
insurance system should be run by the State or
the municipalities ; whether it should be com-
pulsory or not, which simply means whether
the private offices should be entirely shut up
and abolished or allowed to compete with the
State department; whether, in the event of
abolition, they have any claim to be compen-
sated ; to what extent insurance should be done
—whether the maximum should be three-fourths
of nine-tenths the value of the property, or
someother percentage; how the premiums should
be collected, and what rates of premium should
be charged. Also, whether it is advisable to
have any State insurance system at all. With re-
gard to the question of sweeping out the private
institutions : if State insurance is not compul-
sory it obviously means that the State will
have to hustle for business in the same fashion
as private companies and in opposition to them.
It will be simply one more institution added
to a list that is already too long, and the com-
petition, which is already bad, will be made
worse, and the expenses, which are ruinously
heavy by reason of too much competition,
will be made heavier by more competition.
If the State does not propose to run the indus-
try as a monopoly, then the proposed saving
mostly vanishes into air, and there is no reason,
or very little, for it going into the business at
all. If the Turner Government decides to go
into the business as a monopoly, then it and
the Victorian Parliament must decide the ques-
tion of compensation or no compensation. No
commission can relieve them of that responsi-
bility, and no evidence that any commission
can gather from experts —seeing that the ex-
perts are interested parties and are bound to
assert their claim to compensation in every
case—will make the problem any clearer.
Most of the Victorian companies, at present rates,
have lately been losing money on their insur-
ance business, and the idea of compensating
anybody for preventing him losing any more
money, seems grotesque. By combining to put
up rates, as they propose doing, they could
doubtlessmake money, buttheideaof compensat-
ing anybody for loss of the power to needlessly
fleece the public also seems grotesque. Most
of the companies are foreign institutions which
paid nothing for the right of access to Victoria,
and, under these circumstances, there is some-
thing weird about the idea of paying them to
go away. Anyhow, the responsibility of this
problem rests on the Government and the
Legislature, and they must puzzle it out for
themselves quite apart from any commission.
* *
As regards the other questions, the State can
command the services of the best insurance
experts in the country to manage its depart-
ment, and they are likely to throw more light
on details than any gathering of political ama-
teurs can do. The State can certainly afford to
insure all the property in Victoria at the rates
now charged by the private offices, and to
insure to the same extent, which, in general, is
probably about nine-tenths of the value of the
property. As regards the question of State or
municipal management, it hardly requires con-
sideration. State management means one cen-
tral office controlled by the best expert
obtainable, with branches in the principal cen-
tres ; w’ith one strong reserve fund ; with the
Treasury as a guarantee of security; with all
the State and municipal tax-gathering ma-
chinery at command for the collection of pre-
miums, and all the police and detective
and Crown Law r Offices to investigate
the case of the claimant whose ruins
smell toe strongly of kerosene. Municipal
control means 207 small insurance departments,
too poor to pay for expert management, bossed
in an amateur fashion by the butcher-aldermen,
some of them prosperous, some bankrupt, and
most of them in a chronic state of muddle and
incapacity. As regards the most important
issue—whether it is advisable to have any State
insurance system at all—that is another point
on which Isaacs and his colleagues must ulti-
mately struggle to a decision on their own
responsibility. The fact that it is advisable to
have a cheaper and better system of insurance
is admitted. The fact that it is undesirable for
Isaacs to lose his billet, either by rashly trying
to establish a new system or by rashly leaving
it alone, is also, no doubt, plain—to Isaacs. A
small, apologetic inquiry made at the door of
the Upper House would throw more light on
this point than a dozen royal commissions.

material used in biscuit-making has been removed. We
have been honest with the general public and reduced the
prioe of our biscuits considerably, and, as a natural con-
sequence, our factory has ever since been working full
time, the staff increased, besides a considerable improve-
ment in the individual wages of our hands. We not only
believe in Freetrade for the other fellow, but for every
other fellow, ourselves included.
The Bulletin replies, with all due respect for
a manufacturer of excellent biscuits, that Mr.
Aulsebrook throws no light, on anything. (1)
He says he is “prepared to prove” that Pro-
tection, under certain conditions, raises prices,
but as he doesn’t attempt to prove it that
matter may be passed. (2) In the speech
alluded to in the issue of 19th June he said
that Protection in Maoriland compelled him to
reduce prices ; he also said that the reduction
of the N.S.W. protective duty from 2d.
to Id. per lb. led to him reducing prices,
and this paper asked him whether he
meant that Freetrade and Protection both
reduced prices. He doesn’t say with any
certainty, but he now alleges that Pro-
tection leads to the manufacture of cheap,
common, local goods, and the public gladly pays
more for the superior imported article. If the
public is willing to pay more for a superior
article, what prevents the local man making
that superior article ? (3) The Bulletin did
not say that Mr. Aulsebrook came to
Sydney at the time when the duty was 2d.
per lb., for it didn’t know the exact date of his
arrival. It now appears that lie came to Sydney
when the duty was Id. per lb., equal to 20 or
25 per cent. Protection. He stayed, and seem-
ingly prospered, when the duties were raised to
40 or 50 per cent.—the heaviest rate in Aus-
tralasia. He is still here and prospering when
things have gone back to the old level and
he is again protected to the extent of 20 or
25 per cent., which looks a pretty liberal
rate. (4) Mr. Aulsebrook alleges that he
is “ experiencing the effect of Freetrade on
his industry with much satisfaction,” because,
though the manufactured article he makes is
heavily protected, the raw material he uses
comes in free. The Bulletin flatly contradicts
him. It is not he but the man who turns out the
raw material who is “experiencing the effect of
Freetrade.”, Mr. Aulsebrook himself is ex-
periencing the effect of Protection ; he always
has been doing so since he came to N.S.W. ;
and as he doesn’t clamor, either in his original
speech or his letter, for the immediate removal
of the Protection he still enjoys, it would seen),
after all, that it is Freetrade for the other
fellow that he wants—as The Bulletin sug-
gested. Three years hence—in 1900 —he will
get Freetrade for himself, which is quite a dif-
ferent thing. If he is in the same mood then
The Bulletin will be pleased to hear from him.

Vanished in Smoke.
From the commercial column of Sydney Daily
Telegraph of June 29 :—
This is the final day for collecting the present N.S.W.
import duties on the following articles :
This unpretending batch of figures gives the lie
absolutely to the biggest part of the Tele-
graph’s case against Protection. The case in
question is that protective duties are a waste-
ful and ruinous mode of raising revenue, because
the importer passes the duty on with a large
profit added, and the middleman and the re-
tailer do likewise, so that finally where the
State gets >£1000 in duties the consumer pays
.£2000 or so. About six months ago, in fact,
the Telegraph engaged someone (alleged to be
Max Hirsch) to prove that where the Vic.
Government realised £900,000 in duties the
people paid £4,900,000 in extra cost of goods.
Then it issued a list of alleged prices in Sydney
under Freetrado and in Melbourne under Pro-
tection, and, by its own showing, a duty of 3d.
instead of increasing the price of the taxed
article from 6d. to 2s., generally increased it
about the result being that the Treasury,
by the paper’s own showing, received 3d. while
the local consumer paid only Therefore,
protective duties, instead of being the dearest,
were apparently the very cheapest form of
taxation. In the above table the Telegraph
drops into the same hole. It has alleged for
years that duties levied by Government are
passed on to the consumer with 50 or more per
cent, added for middleman’s profits. There-
fore, a duty of 3d. adds at least 4|d. to the
price, and the removal of a 3d. duty would
naturally take 4Jd. or more off the price. Yet,
in the list quoted, it announces that the price
will be reduced by exactly the amount of the
duty, and no more. Therefore, it seems that
the State loses £63,000 a year revenue, and the
consumer saves just £63,000 a year, and he must
pay £63,000 a year in some other form of taxa-
tion to fill the gap, and there is no removal of
any “ burden,” after all. Even if Protection
didn’t help along any local industry it is still,
by the Freetrade paper’s own showing, as cheap
a means of raising revenue as any other, and
the story about £1000 of duties costing the
consumer £2000 or so in additional prices ap-
pears to have vanished in smoke.
No Australian Need Apply.
dear Bulletin,— The N.S.W. Bar is indeed
a happy hunting - ground for English bar-
risters who take up their residence here.
How is it that even Australians in big posi-
tions, who, on proper occasions, thank God
they are not as other men are—foreigners—
always appoint the adventurers — I do not
necessarily use this word in its disrespectful
sense—to snug billets ? Almost every billet
open to members of the N.S. W. Bar is promptly
filled by a barrister whose main qualification is
that lie is “ English, you know.” Jack Want,
for instance, who is very keen in a popular
cause, and denounces the C.S. Board for ap-
pointing a solicitor to the Tax-Commissioners,
and so poaching on his preserves, puts in “ on his
own” a pushing young Irishman, M r. Pollock, as
his secretary. No applications were invited for
the position, though the Public Service Act pro-
vides that that shall be done when a billet has
to be filled from outside the ranks of the Civil
Service. Jack’s patronage is now, more or less,
worked by his secretary—who has lately put
in a pal (Mr. Salisbury) as Master in Equity
during the absence of Master Barton. The
pal is, of course, English, and though he has
most satisfactorily acted as Registrar in Bank-
ruptcy there is no evidence before the public
that he has any particular knowledge of Equity.
The pal expected to get Mr. Pollock’s billet ;
but, having failed, Mr. Pollock, it would
appear, now consoles him. This is only a speci-
men of how the imported article is used to fill
up every vacancy in the legal part of the Govt,
service. Take the Quarter Sessions Crown-
Prosecutors : how many of them are N.S. W.
men ? Who get the nice fat briefs to prosecute
on Circuit? Who are the barristers who
receive all the Crown patronage on the civil
side of the Courts ? English to a man. Per-
haps this is only the effect of the Freetrade
proclivities of the Government. In this con-
nection it is interesting to observe that Mr.
Heydon, Q.C., Consolidator of Statutes, has
given to Australians a very fair show on the
Statutes Consolidation Commission, over which
he presides. When Mr. Heydon offered to
undertake the work he stipulated that he
should himself choose the men who were to
assist him. He picked a fair number of N.S.
Wales men—can this have any connection with
Mr. Hkydon’s fiscal belief? The only excuse
for giving such preference to the imported bar-
rister would be that the home-grown article is
inferior to him ; but is he ? Most emphatically
not. The usual English appointee of the
Government is one of whose existence the
public only becomes aware when his appoint-
ment is published, and one who could hardly
earn his salt in open competition with his
Australian-grown confreres ; recognising this, he
uses his “influence,” or that of his friends or
relations, with the Government—unfortunately
with only too large a measure of success.—R.R.

The Sunday Beer Problem.
Parson Boyce, of Sydney, has broken out in a
new direction. A week or two ago he was re-
ported as alleging that the Sunday closing of
hotels, in 1882, reduced the N.S. W. convictions
for drunkenness by 50 per cent.—which it cer-
tainly did not. He now explains as follows in
the columns of S.M. Herald :
As I observe that my statement is impugned that when
the present Sunday-closing law for public-houses was
enacted the convictions for drunkenness decreased by
about 50 per cent., I desire to say that my authority is the
return placed before Parliament by the Minister for
Justice, and ordered by the House, on Bth September,
18S5, to be printed. The exact figures are : Convictions
for Sunday drunkenness in 1881, the last year of the old
Act, were 2462 ; and in the next year, under the new,
1268. The great improvement has been more than main-
tained, as seen by the figures given by Mr. Gould as to
1895. He said the convictions for the Sundays of that
year were 1196, while those for Saturday were 5860. From
these striking figures it is clear that if the bars were re-
opened on Sundays by law, a large increase in the con-
victions might be reasonablj- expected.
Parson Boyce here speaks of “my statement ”
that “ the convictions for drunkenness de-
creased by about 50 per cent.” being impugned
—it was The Bulletin which impugned it—
and seeing that the said convictions increased
for several years after 1882 instead of diminish-
ing, it shows a considerable amount of gall on
the rev. gentleman’s part to mention that the
thing in question is his statement. Then,
instead of proving his assertion that “convic-
tions for drunkenness ” decreased, he quotes
figures to prove that convictions for Sunday
drunkenness decreased, which is quite a dif-
ferent matter. Possibly they did decrease, but
the point at issue is that the convictions for
drunkenness in general started to increase
immediately after 1882—the first Sunday-clos-
ing year. What does it signify if people were
50 per cent, less drunk on Sunday when
they were 75 per cent, drunker on some other
day to make up for it ? The point which
Parson Boyce mildly shuffles away from
every time is that in 1883—the first complete
year under the Sunday-closing system—the
number of drunks convicted was 200 more than
in 1881—the last complete Sunday-drunk year.
Also, in 1884, there were 1200 more ; in 1885,
3000 more ; and the same in 1886. Seeing that
Parson Boyce said “the convictions for drunken-
ness decreased about 50 per cent.” when Sun-
day-closing came into force, and seeing that he
again quotes this as “my statement,” and
further, seeing that the said statement is a
weak and boshy tarradiddle, the dear old
reverend ought to explain his dreadful inac-
curacy.

Cow-Merchant Brunker.
“ Machaon ”to The Bulletin Dear Bul-
letin, —Your estimate of N.S.W. Acting-Pre-
mier Brunker will be acceded to by all who
have intelligently watched the gentleman’s
career. A cattle-salesman by profession,
Brunker is a splendid example of a man of less
than mediocre ability pushed to the front rank
of politics by newspaper assistance. Had Mr.
Brunker’s brother-in-law, the Sydney Morn-
ing Herald, not boomed Brunker, it is hard
to believe that he would ever by his own
ability have risen above the position of “ cow-
merchant” at Maitland. The S.M. Herald
consistently boomed Brunker until it placed
him on a pedestal as a straightforward, God-
fearing, able politician. And Brunker,
on his side, played his part well by
seldom opening his mouth, except to
give forth safe utterances on God and
Brunker’s integrity. “ There are two ways,”
once said Washington Irving, “ in which a
man can gain a reputation for wisdom. One is
by talking a great deal and thinking very little ;
the other by shutting his mouth and not think-
ing at all.” Immediately Brunker had to act,
he gave the S.M. Herald’s estimate of him
right away. But the Herald sticks to its
fetish. The other day in Parliament Lyne hit
Brunker hard on his alleged nepotism. The
Daily Telegraph reported the incident, but
the Herald suppressed all mention. At the
time of the Federal election the D.T. put
Brunker aside as an incompetent; the Herald
boomed him, and Brunker was elected a
delegate. At Adelaide Brunker was the
miserable failure of the Convention.
The official report of the Adelaide Con-
vention gives Brunker away badly. There
was evidently no friendly reporter on hand
to write or correct speeches—Brunker made
three—two personal wails and one gaunt,
four-column peroration. Here is a slab of
Brunker’s best “ cow-merchant ” style. Con-
vention Report, p. 365 :
It matters not where we are located, what position we
occupy, or what is our nationality, it as true colonists we
do our duty well, the future is fuil of promise, not only to
the present generation but to those who are to come after
us ; and, unless as time advances and the circumstances
and conditions of the colonies change most materially, our
future is assured beyond all peradventure ; and this fair
land, dedicated by our ancestors to liberty and freedom,
will become so firmly affixed to the soil that, it shall live
for all time, and continue to shine as a beacon-light to
the whole world, showing that an intelligent people are
capable of self-government.
“Assured beyond all peradventure . . .
unless,” is not too bad, but “a fair land”
becoming “affixed to the soil” and “shiningas
a beacon-light ” is just the kind of blatherskite
one might expect from a “ cow-merchant ” of
Brunker’s pretensions. Reid, P.C., showed
marvellous perspicacity when lie selected the
bullocky-minded Brunker to be Acting-
Premier. The cute Reid has made Brunker
prick his own bubble reputation. The empty
Brunker may now be thrown overboard as soon
as it suits Reid to do so.

Colonial Clergy.
A medical man, advising his dyspeptic patient
to find food for laughter, couldn’t do better
than refer the sufferer to the daily press for a
course of “ religious discussion ” reading. The
whole conduct of church business is so keen a
satire upon Christianity that no one—priest,
pew-renter, politician, or journalist—can speak
of it in a serious spirit without becoming an
unconscious humorist, and the newspaper com-
mentator professing to treat the subject from a
sober, eommonsense point of view is the drollest
creature in the crowd. A case in point. Last
week the Anglican church party of Victoria
celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of their
first bishop’s arrival in Melbourne. The
professional pietiets, having thanked the
Lord for His goodness in permitting them
to enjoy a Jubilee luncheon, proceeded to
congratulate Him upon the healthy state
of His favorite ( i.e . Anglican) church, after
which lawyer Best, M.L.A., chipped in the
suggestion that parsons of local manufacture
should now begin to fill the fat billets hitherto
reserved for imported articles. Mr. Best com-
plained, in effect, if not in words, that the
Australian-born clergyman was not getting a
fair cut at the loaves and fishes. Then a
bishop (from Hingland) pointed out to the
worldly lawyer-man a very good church reason
why billets requiring deportment {and culchaw
in the occupant are at present monopolised (or
nearly so) by new-chuins. In England the
“ established ” Church is a fashionable profes-
sion. Wealthy’ fathers, with lots of—haw !
style and breeding, have a son or two
prepared for—haw ! —Holy Ordahs, and the
result is a scholarly, dignified class of parsons
such as Australia has not yet attempted to
raise. Our “Nicest people” do not supply
recruits for the Lord’s crack regiment (the
Anglican Blues, we will call it), and not until
bloated squatters and capitalists in general
follow the example of Hinglish sassiety, can
the A.N.A. hope to supply this country with—
haw !—high-class bishops. The explanation is
thoroughly sound from an episcopal point of
view. Also, it is screamingly funny, yet not
more funny than the sordid protest of the law-
yer who called it forth, or the comments of
Melb. Age thereon. The Age says :
It seems never to have occurred to the good prelate
that he was here giving utterance to two facts that stand
in the relation of cause and effect. The clergy in the
colonies have none of the highest prizes in their pro-
tession to look forward to, and the best men are unwilling
fo enter the Church. To law, medicine, literature, and
politics Australians give of their best, because all of them
offer careers to the men who engage in them.
In short, it is useless to expect a* highly intel-
ligent preaching of Christ’s doctrines from men
who “ have none of the highest prizes in their
profession to look forward to.” If you want
first-class apostles nowadays you must promise
them a thumping salary and a pair of gaiters in
the not-distant future. No brainy Christian
cares to serve Cod on the ordinary colonial
terms. Religion for the native-born clergy-
man is too much like the religion of Christ, in
which, as everybody knows, there is r.o money,
but merely board and lodging and second-hand
clothes.

Where people marry without any intention of
living together—merely, as Justice Simpson
euphemistically phrases it, “to save the girl’s
character”—N.S.W. Divorce Law does not
accept an application for divorce on the ground
of desertion. This is not good humanity,
neither is it good morality, and it is regrettable
if it be found to be good law. Was it the in-
tention of N.S.W. legislators when framing the
law to legislate on the intention with which
persons contract matrimony ? The intention to
not live together would, in certain ecclesiasti-
cal senses, render a marriage null. How does
it come that this same intention in the civil
sense is refused the relief of a dissolution 1 On
the face of it, the subject needs more than a
Judge’s dictum to produce a unanimous opinion.
N.S.W. Just-ice Minister Gag-Ghould lets it
be known that the Botany Bay back-door is
open for Thomas Suffield’s release if he likes
to crawl through on petition— i.e., waive his
right to an open enquiry, and practically admit
his guilt by suing for mercy. If Suffield’s
health is good enough after six years of living
death, his manhood should do nothing of the
sort. Guilty or innocent, it is a public scandal
that a man condemned on such contradictory
and uncorroborated evidence should be denied
a re-hearing of his case—just as it is a public
scandal that four affidavits containing much
fresh evidence should have been suppressed (as
The Bulletin is credibly informed by the
signatories) at the hands of the Crown Law
Dept. And Suffield’s case will be re heard.
Eighteen months ago a Melbourne man was
sent to gaol for a long term for abducting a
year-old girl. The keeper of a house where he
sought admission for himself and the “innocent
child ” gave information to the police, and the
child’s modest demeanor in court appeared to
justify a stiff sentence for her would be “be-
trayer.” Last week the young heroine, just
arrived at the age of consent, was discovered,
in the nude, in a Chow’s den, and Constable
Appleby testified that her father has been
addicted to sending her out to get money for his
horse-racing “punts.” The case of the man
who was gaoled 18 months back for abducting
this artless infant seems to need reconsideration
in the light of recent disclosures. Probably
she was at that time already engaged in busi-
ness for her delectable parent —seeking whom
she might be devoured by. If the police-story
is correct, the felon has probably paid in full
by now for all the damage he, in this case,
did to social purity.
E. Denman, Mackay delegate to the Agricultu-
ral Conference held at Gatton (Q.), put the pro-
kanaka argument thus—
At Homebush —which, in former years, was worked as
a cattle-station by two whites and a few aboriginals—
there are now 170 white farmers settled on the land, who
constantly employ 100 white laborers. In addition to
these, there are 120 extra laborers during the six months’
crushing, 120 more in the mill, besides white eane-cutters
earning, amongst them, from ±'2ooo to £3OOO per season ;
besides 7000 tons of freight for steamers, for the team-
sters and railway, and for the wharf-laborers to handle.
Homebush also employs nearly 1000 horses, consuming
Southern maize, and finds work for not le-s than 700 white
men and 400 kanakas, all of whom consume Southern
produce. Surely this is a desirable change from the posi-
tion of the same land when held as a cattle-station ; yet,
were the 400 kanakas taken away, the whole gigantic co-
operative plantation would collapse.
Would it? 1 here is the begsed question. Also,
Allora (Q„) black-soil plains in former years
were not worked at all; now they support a
thriving white agricultural population—without
kanakas. Also, as whites can and do cut cane
(it used to be alleged that they couldn’t), why
employ kanakas ? Because they are cheap,
and mean more money for the greedy
white boss. The white man cuts cane, because
he is allowed to take that work by contract;
he won’t trash cane, because the planters only
offer him kanaka wages for it.
The present helpless state of Vic. Opposition
party is advertised by the election of G. D.
Carter as temporary leader. But the Opposi-
tion may be stronger after next election.
Premier Turner comes back to Melbourne a
new and nobbled man, too full of Jubilee
memories to be his old self ever again. Tur-
ner’s recollections of Hingland will, in the
ordinary course of human nature, prove much
too strong for his democratic principles. Will
the lawyer ivho (in a cocked hat and silk
stockings) waved his hand to the London
mob preserve much respect for the opinions of
Sam Lyons’s partner ? Not much. An Aus-
tralian, pitchforked into the forefront of one
of the “ biggest” pageants the world has wit-
nessed up to date, becomes a Tory in 24 hours.
The Right Honorable Turner, Knight, had
about a fortnight of it sights, splendors,
luxuries such as he had never dreamed of. He
returns to little Melbourne feeling like an ex-
Atheist who has been enjoying % trip to the
Kingdom of Heaven.
Melb. Australasian even pasted its little
moan about the advisability of selling the rail-
ways to a shindykit on Commissioner Eddy’s
tomb :
Mr. Eddy had much more to do than manage in the
sense in which that term is understood in England. There
the railway manager has to be principally on his guard
against the rivalry of intelligence, enterprise, and cash
resources as great as any which he can himself command.
But the rivalry is carried on in a big way, and each
manager has at his back a powerful, staunch, and con-
fiding directory. He gets cheering support. Very differ-
ent is the lot of the railway manager under Government
m Australia. In each province the railway system is a
State monopoly. There is no rivalry to fear except along
the borders, and what little there is of that causes small
anxiety. But the very fact that the system is a monopoly
makes management onerous, exacting, heartbreaking. The
railways are constructed and worked to serve political,
party, and class ends. Political influence may be excluded
from the appointment of employes, but it is present
almost everywhere else, and the manager who aims at
serving the public by making the lines useful and re-
munerative finds that all the attack he has to contend
against comes from or through the authorities at his back.
The support he gets from the Ministry of the day is
seldom genuine, never thorough, and at best short-lived.
So we can realise how- Mr. Eddy, striving to manage the
railways in the light of English and American experience,
found the task heart-straining as well as brain-straining.
The masters he was laboring to serve—the people in the
mass—were unappreciative, while there were constantly
arrayed against him forces as potent, as ceaseless,
as malignant as any which human imagination has
credited to the evil magician. Railway managing in
Australia, where it aims at being efficient, is work only
for men of unconquerable will, exalted principle, and in-
vincible physique. Their reward, if any ever comes to
them besides their salary, comes after they are dead.
Well, it is something for your reward to come
at all, even after death. Two managers of big
private concerns, who recently died worn-out
and covered with vituperation— Drury, of the
Queensland National, and Colin Longmuir,
the Man that’s Dead of the defunct City of
Melbourne Bank—didn’t get their reward even
then.
♦
Magistrate Panton, of Melbourne, “ dis-
courages the proposal to grant monetary pen-
sions to the aged poor on the ground that the
large majority of them would promptly go out
and get drunk.” Panton, by the nature of his
business, comes in contact almost exclusively
with the sort of aged poor who do get drunk,
and, being a narrow-minded man of routine, he
assumes that all the rest must be like the aged
poor he associates with. But why all this
anxiety about the aged poor keeping sober ?
If the very old pensioner does drink his weekly
dole of 10s., then the State immediately gets
Bs. of it back in liquor-duty, and nothing else
that the aged poor could do would pay it neatly
so well. Next it would run in the aged poor
for being intoxicated, and either make another
ss. out of the fine or else save a week’s money
while the aged one was doing his seven days’ .
hard. Finally, the apocryphal patriarch, who
weighs so heavily on Panton’s mind, would
some day fall down dead through drinking his
10s. all at once, and then his pension would
be saved for ever afterwards. Does Panton
want the aged popr to get iEto such a dread-
fully hygienic state that they will go on draw-
ing their pensions for ever ? The State has to
consider economy in these hard times, and
vigorous drinking among the aged poor is a
thing not wholly unpraise worthy


Thomas A. Edison, the great inventor, has

The footprints of many other plays and
playwrights are conspicuous all over “A Night
Out” —the comedy-shriek which opened the Paul-
ton season at Her Majesty’s, Sydney. There is no
mistaking these footprints; they are as conspicuous
as the marks where the megatherium has been
standing after rain. The people who go out late
at night and gaily dine with other people’s hus-
bands and wives are reminiscent of old “ Pink
Dominoes,” and many other things besides. The
police who raid the hotel and bowl out these
people because of the discrepancy in their names
are the same police who rush the other hotel
in the “Magistrate.” “A Night Out” is the
good old tale of how a hen-pecked husband broke
loose in his wife’s absence and went on a fearsome
razzle-dazzle with the wife of s unebody else, and
how they painted the city red, and turned it up-
side-down and put a brick on top of it. The first
act is long and rather slow ; it is the gradual
building up of the chain of circumstances which
leads to the razzle. The third act is also long,
and in it all the people lie about their black eyes
and torn frocks, and bruises and swelled heads,
and, when the curtain goes down, they are stdl
lying beautifully. All the complication is crowded
into Act 11,, which is confused beyond descrip-
tion. No one could give a coherent account of the
nightmare of Act 11., in which four girls are going
to bed on one side of the stage, and an intoxicated
architect is already in bed unknown to them, and
the architect’s wife is trying unsuccessfully to be
a dissipated character in the next room, and her
fellow conspirator is losing her hat over the
balcony where he retired to be very ill after smok-
ing a strong cigar ; while an Italian who is behind
with his rent is assaulting a waiter in the corridor,
and the police are bursting in, and the place is
more or less pervaded with ghosts in addition to
its other troubles.
* * * *
“ A Night Out ” would be a really excel-
lent farce if it were played differently. There is
too little youth in it, and too much dreary middle
age. The giddy, frivolous, bad man is got up as a
short, hard person of bricklaying aspect and about
50 years of age. His wife is a stout personage orga-
nised in a style of premeditated ugliness, and in-
stead of regarding her with mere indifference he
views her with a loathing that is almost tragic.
The heroine he frivols with is made to represent
plain, undisguised SO or more, and is the wife of a
common-place individual whose years are uncer-
tain. The only other person who takes a very
direct part in the story is a white-haired in-
dividual of 60 or so. tut for a certain cheerful
waiter, and a perky maid who only appears
for a few minutes, and the four girls who want to
go to bed, arid who also don t stay long, A
Night Out ” is played almost entirely as a comedy
of grumpy middle age, and the spectacle of the
middle-aged people trying to frisk around in youth-
ful dissipation is a melancholy discord all through.
If half-a-century were taken off the combined
years of the five prominent characters it would be
a ton weight removed from the back of the show.
* * * *
The brightest and best individual in the
cast is Albert Whelan as the frisky casual waiter,
Oecil Ward also does his part well, but it is a part
with few opportunities, except a large black eye
in Act 111. Fred Cainbourne, as another waiter,
Oily Deering, a casual Italian who is behind
with his rent and who explodes violently in the
passage, and O. M. Berkeley, deserve great credit.
Of the new people Ernest Shand is far the best, so
far as the present show goes, and his white hair,
and his smile, and his dazzling white teeth light
up some dark places very effectively. So far as
Miss Alma Stanley is concerned, this paper would
prefer to drop that lady, and her acting, and her
dress, and her atrocious hat right out of the sub-
ject ; the things it feels inclined to say about her
are all things that are better left unsaid. Paul-
ton’s acting on the first night, at all events,
was unenchanting, and his loud, hard monotone
was painful to listen to; also, Mrs. Bryer was
only a moderate success. Miss Stafford and the
four girls who want to go to bed are pleasant frag-
ments of youth and brightness, but “ A Night
Out,” as a whole, is a good comedy whioh gets
less than justice.
# * * *
A spell of “ GiroflAG-irofla ” is in progress
this week at Sydney Opera House, which has now
been open so long that it is almost beginning to
regard itself as a live establishment again.
Lecocq’s tale of the prince who lived in the land
of nowhere in particular, and was sioklied o’er by
the pale cast of twins, is a breezy thing at all
times, and the upheaval of Knight Aston as
Marasquin makes it still more so. That tuneful
tenor never gets any older personally, and his
voice doesn’t get much older either. Also, he
never takes himself seriously ; he has a tendency
for the cork to fly out of him constantly, and
he dances through his part with the cheerful-
recklessness of a person who might, under
brighter auspices, have taken to the church
and been a bishop doing a skirt - dance
in a cathedral. Miss Glendinning is a pretty,
nicely-dressed and rather successful pair of twins ;
Miss Lambert's Pedro is one of the best The
Bulletin can remember, and Maud Lita’s Paquita
calls for some kindly observations. Farley’s Moor
is an old-established bass Moslem, who is too well-
known to require commendation. The scenery is
a trifle gone to seed, and the chorus gets
out of step now and then, and Don Bolero
ia a rather inefficient and straggly parent who
only seems to keep up at all because the
breezy Marasquin blows him along, ana the
pirates capture Girofla in a rather weak and
unconvincing fashion, and other loose ends of
detail hang out here and there, but, on the whole,
the jury returns a three-quarter verdict m favor o
the defendant. “ Girofle-Girofla is a very good
production in the main, and if a friend wou
take the management aside in a forbearing
and point out with an axe the few details which
want amendment, it might be made even better.
The orchestra goes well, and at least halt the co.
is good enough to satisfy any possible demands at
the price. Probably the saddest thing in the
show is the constant effort of seven Moors to
divide themselves into two lines with an equal
number of Moors in each. The Bulletin pre-
sumes that an eighth Moor is absent through
scarletina.
* * * *
Last Monday a tearful remark in the daily
papers announced that Sydney Criterion had
closed up owing to the serious illness of Miss
Elsie Adair, who, it is reported, will probably
never do her butterfly dance again, by reason or a
severe heart-affection. The illness of the principal
lady often covers a multitude of things in the
way of bad business and indignant revolt on the
part of the orchestra, but in the present case the
trouble was real enough. Miss Adair fainted on
the stage during Saturday night s performance,
and on Monday she was still in such a bad state
that the show had either to go on without her or
not at all. As the bright little woman was more
than half of it in her own attractive person, the
uselessness of any attempt to go on was apparent,
and the Cri. shut up abruptly. It was a very
pleasant entertainment on the whole, and the
sudden closure is a thing to be regretted.
* * # *
The Flying J ordans commence a farewell
season of ten nights at Sydney Lyceum on Satur-
day. Virginia Aragon, the lady who dances on a
hair in space, and the other members of the
original co., are on the programme as before, and
Miss Lily Post, described as the American Queen
of Song, is another attraction.. Melville Stoltz’s
co. left a reputation behind it on the occasion
when it tried to break its neck in tights at the
Royal, which should ensure a good reception.
* * * *
“Mrs. Quinn’s Twins,” a new Irish
musical comedy, is to be staged at Sydney Royal
on Saturday. “Johanna” has done a tolerably
successful three weeks’ season in its own confused
way, and if Mrs. Quinn’s reckless addition to the
population lasts as long Miss Moore will have no
special cause for complaint. In view of the
rapidly - decreasing Australian birth-rate this
paper considers Mrs. Quinn’s conduct in having
twins as highly commendable and a noble example
to the female population.
* * * *
The Avolos turned up in due course at
Sydney Tivoli, where they do harrowing feats
on the bars nightly. It is a. difficult thing to
put up any records in this line in view of the
doings of some recent performers, but even under
these conditions the new people are remarkable.
A palatial “first part” with a vast amount of
expensive wardrobe in it has been inserted in the
programme, and most of the people that The
Bulletin hasn’t time to mention just now are
giving general satisfaction as usual.
* * * *
“ The Sign of the Cross” was duly hung
out, at Melb. Princess’s, last Saturday, before an
audience that had mostly booked seats in advance.
Towards the end of the melodrama there were
evidences that the congregation felt bored. The
dress-circle started to cough, in the interested tone
of people who find the sermon palling upon them,
and would like to get away without putting three-
pence in the plate. The app al to their religious
convictions touched them e.th r on the wrong
spot or nowhere at all. But a first-night effect is
not a fair indication of popular thought concern-
ing Early Christianity ; moreover sassiety in this
case had dropped some money at the races, and
was unusually weak in the Faith essential to
solemn enjoyment of church dogmas. Wilson
Barrett’s play was intended to tickle ignorance
and capture the pulpit vote, and doubtless it will
achieve its purpose in Melbourne as elsewhere.
The stage setting, anyway, is quite impressive,
and the dialogue sometimes rises about half-way to
the level of the spectacle.
* * * •
“ The Sign of the Cross ” has been already
much discussed by The Bulletin. Everybody
knows it is a gorgeous representation of Christian
virtue contrasted with Pagan vice in Nero’s time,
when the dominant Faith of nowadays amounted
to high treason and was punished accordingly.
Nero, in Anno Domini 64, put Christians to flame
with rather less brutality than their sister Mary, the
other Christian, displayed 1500 years later. He
soaked them in oil and pitch, that they might burn
merrily; whereas Queen Mary, having heard of a
Saviour’s love, used to frizzle ’em in their own
grease. Christianity in A.D. 64 was a danger to
the profligate Roman monarch, hence the outbreak
of martyrdom. Republicanism was a dangerous
religion in 1820, so two men were hanged and be-
headed at Stirling castle for speaking disrespect-
fully of George the Fourth. Perhaps they said Our
Gracious Queen’s royal uncle wasn’t much better
than Nero. These rude comments are chipped in
by way of suggesting that “ The Sign of the
Cross ” would be a grimly humorous play but for
its lack of realism in the religious scenes. If
Miss Ferrar, for instance, were to hug her charac-
ter with enthusiasm, one might picture her as an
Early Protestant marching to the stake at Smith-
field. But she and the other full-sized martyrs
are obviously acting their colorless parts, and the
small boy who shrieks from the torture-chamber
is an unmistakeable fraud. The leading male
Pagans appear genuine in many cases, especially
Nero, although the physical condition of
that notorious fiddler as depicted by Caleb
Porter is doubtless a fascinating libel on
the original. The real Nero was only 27 at the
period of his set against the Christians, and his
dissipations left him sufficient nerve for a suicide
some time afterwards. Julius Knight makes a
manly Marcus, whilst Gaston Mervale is merely
the same Black Elphberg as before, disguised in a
toga, and chopping his lines into uncertain musical
lengths, like a barrel-organ. Miss Elliott Page
is a conspicuous success among the Pagan
ladies, most of whom are unnaturally giddy j
also J. B. Atholwood shines in the capacity
of a Roman spy, and comes to exactly the same
sort of grief as Harvey Duff and other modern
identities. “The Sign of the Cross,” constructed
by a veteran actor, abounds in reminders of con-
temporary work. Marcus, coming on to save his
girl and form a tableau, is as inevitable as the
timely arrival of Walter Baker in a Bland Holt
melodrama. The tortured-ohristian incident sug-
gests “La Tosca ; ” saintly Mercia, praying
amidst the Pagan deini-mondaines, is a similar
person to Miss Ross in the Panther’s Den; the
terror-stricken informer, as aforesaid, is an old
theatrical acquaintance. Familiar stage devices
in the situations and business crop up at every
turn of the play, and give it away to hardened
theatregoers. Yet it is almost certain to boom in
Melbourne, and the present writer expects to have
Nero under observation for weeks to come. The
first matinee will be given on Saturday.
Bland Holt, at the Royal, recognising
powerful rivalry in a spectacular drama which
smells of mangled Christian, has decided to change
his bill on Saturday, for the last time this season.
“The Cotton King” is the piece chosen from
B.H’s collection, and it will be introduced to
Australia on a vast scale.
** * *
“Rip Yan Winkle” is now working
smoothly and melodiously at the Alexandra, to
the general satisfaction of such as can induce
themselves to give old friend Howard Vernon a
turn. The management hasn’t yet restored the
proper name of the theatre, but, despite its unwise
alias (“ The Queen’s ”), and notwithstanding two
or three weak spots in the “Rip ” cast, the front
of the house grows somewhat less desolate every
week. A revival of “Madame Angot”will fol-
low “Rip,” but meanwhile the indomitable
Clifford Ferley appears to be bringing special
theatre parties to the rescue, so Planquette’s opera
may possibly hold the floor until the 17th.
** * *
The Selbinis arrived at Melb. Opera House
on Saturday, and the success of those whirling
marvels came right up to the advertisement’s pre-
diction. The Rickards show is a mighty power
at present. Phil. Newbury’s warble excites the
multitude, and the list of popular “turns” is so
long that the multitude has, to a great extent,
departed, full of joy, ere Will Whitburn brings
up the rear. An entertainment which can keep
wag Whitburn in the background is a thing to be
spoken of with awe.
** * *
“ The Hermit’s Bell,” a rather comic opera
of romantic tendencies, will appear at Melb. Bijou
on Thursday (Bth) and two following nights. The
show is in aid of the fever hospital, and a nice
new chorus of 60 voices will sing under the patron-
age of the Governor.
** * *
The Ovide Musin Co. has arranged for
farewell concerts at Melb. Exhibition Buildings,
on Saturdays 10th and 17tli. Also, a series of
Chamber Music Concerts, with Messrs. Allan and
Co. in command, will be given at the Athenaeum
Hall on four Wednesday afternoons. The first
concert was to feel the public purse on Wednesday
of this week at 3.30 p.m.
** * *
Next Saturday (10th) Carl Hertz opens a
short season at the Athenaeum Hall. The wizard
in question has come back triumphant from
Maoriland with a bloated banking-account and an
up-to-date Cinematography, which promises to
make an impression in a city where the Cine, is
almost a forgotten novelty.
** * *
The Caledonian Society of Melbourne
issued invitations, the other day, for “those who
take an interest in musical matters ” to come along
and hear “ Mr. Campbell’s Remarkable Tenor
Voice.” Mr. Campbell was described as a 25-
year-old native of Sale (Vic.), who had been a
blacksmith until the Caledonians “ discovered ”
his marvellous natural gift—and turned his head.
The young man’s appearance was not less dis-
appointing than his vocal revelation. He is a
cherubic-looking aspirant, with plenty of platform
assurance, and he struck people at once as the
typical up-country concert-singer, confirmed in
his own vocal conceit by the adulation of
bucolic audiences. As far as could be judged
from his assault on the “ The Holy City ” and
other numbers, his voice is not more promising
than 50 other organs that might be discovered by
any casual explorer. In its raw, untrained state
it is baritone, rather than tenor, and not particu-
larly powerful, or sweet, in either case. The fact
that the young Gippslander already seems quite
self-satisfied with his singing, having cultivated a
gentle smirk, an upward turn of the eye, and con-
siderable calm repose, suggests that he is not over-
endowed with the temperament and brains indis-
pensable to the production of an artist.
At Poverty Point.
Dear Bulletin, —The influence of a certain “ red-
covered rag,” given to attacking J. Bull, must be held
accountable for the blind fury with which many young
Australians butt at Harry Paulton, an old-established
Hinglish actor, as though he were a red rag, and they—
bulls. By these plunging critics Paulton’s reputation and
acting method have been likened to Johnny Toole’s, not-
withstanding that the newcomer is palpably the original,
or half original, of Elton, and he, unlike Toole, was an
over-rated Australian idol in days of yore. Now, as re-
gards J.L.T.’s “ reputation,” I can speak as a Londonet
who was weary—we were all weary —of that old-fashioned
joker fully twenty years ago. He hadn’t moved with the
times in farcical comedy acting, neither was he much of a
natural humorist at any time, and although he subse-
quently built his own theatre and lived on self-advt.
(assisted by Irving’s friendly puffs), the theatre was only
a very little one, and his followers were mostly country
folk, ready to laugh at anything that professes to be
funny. Touching the alleged resemblance between Toole
and Paulton, as comedians, I can see no cause for the
allegation except anti-Hinglish prejudice. Toole was a
mummer who jerked his head, elevated his eyebrows, and
“pulled mugs” at the audience. His voice inclined to
huskiness, he often spoke rapidly and chopped his words.
Paulton doesn’t jerk his head, or grimace, or attempt any
sort of extravagance. His voice is dry and metallic in its
ring, and his humor the deliberate expression of a
humor that is born in the actor s soul. He doesn’t try to
force it upon the audience because it doesn’t lend itself to
the forcing process, and therein he differs from Elton.
The nervous, assertive portion of Elton’s method was
copied from Johnny Toole. Elton, to my way of thinking,
lacked natural humor, but he was an experienced, agde
mummer, who played fine, fat parts— n n ged to get
dyspeptic Young Australia by the wool. n ther point,
dear Bulletin. You will find Paulton's oiow, solemn
method objected to particularly by the very men who
admired Nat Goodwin in “In Mizzoura,” a performance
which consisted largely of leaning against a door or a
verandah-post, and drawling out sentences at long inter-
vals. Goodwin came from ’Murka. I have observed that
the young Australians, who (never having been outside
their own country) feel unkindly disposed towards Hing-
lish institutions, endeavor to square their prejudices with
an intense admiration for aught that comes from America.
—Melbourne.
Frank Thornton had to pay £5OO into N.Q. Supreme
Court in connection with suits for damages for alleged
“ defamation,” in order to avoid the issue of a ca. re. The
miracle is that “ The Private Secretary ” paid it How
unprofessional !
George Rignold has been fined for conducting c lottery
in M.L., because he gave everyone who visited his theatre
a chance of winning a bicycle. What about the news-
papers which offer “ competitions” to all who buy a copy
and cut out a “ coupon ? ”
Miss Florence Schmidt travelled to Melbourne the other
week with the id a of introducing her voice to local notice
at a private reception. An unlucky cold, caught during
the train-journey, put the young artist hoarse de combat.
The Australian Amateur Opera Co. (Melb.) wants to give
its performance of “The Gondoliers” at the Princesss,
by way of challenging comparison with the Firm’s pro-
duction of the same opera.
The long monologue, “ How it Happened,” which. Alma
Stanley recites in “My Friend from India,” and in the
course of which she executes a couple of kick-upy i an :es,
used to be performed beautifully by Kate Vaughan at
drawing-room entertainments in London years ago. The
writer saw her do it years before “My Friend from
India” was thought of; and as a dancer, the elongated
and bulky Stanley is not to be mentioned in the same
breath with Kate Vaughan. But why does Miss Stanley
do the monologue as though it were part of the play ?
Why is there no mention on the programme of the fact
that it is an interpolation? Why is not the author given
credit for it ?
Cockaigne : “ Byron, Burnand, or the Broughs, in the
palm3 T days, would have knocked up an amazing bur-
lesque out of the ‘ Sign of the Cross,’ or ‘ A Nero and His
Mercy,’ ah ! But the bourgeois public would have been
like a good lady who wanted a friend of mine turned out
of the Melb. National Gallery for blaspheming the bales of
wool put for mountains in Herbert’s ‘Moses.’ ”
Not often in these times do managers receive spon-
taneous public deputations beseeching them to extend
their seasons. Bui the Pollards just had this experience
at Broken Hill, whose un-get-at-ableness leads to its being
passed by many co.’s, despite the abundance of its ready
money. The Pollards are having a 16-nights’ run there.
Melb. : “ Too late for statics as to Mrs. Lingard’s form.
Anyhow, it charmed the public of our city, when she
appeared as Orpheus, in burlesque, to Horace’s Pluto.
Young Miss Nellie Stewart came out with a colorable
imitation, on a revival of the piece, or one similar. Horace
Lingard, who had remarkable teeth, did something like
Henry Lee’s quick changes.”
Bishop Moorhouse; so deliciously fooled by Jennie Lee
with “ Jo,” would have been on hand for the “ Sign of the
Cross,” but Goe won’t go. Not to be had.
Daggerwood : “ George Herbert Rogers was a genius.
Originally a soldier of William IV. in Tasmania,, he got his
discharge through the unparalleled talent of his amateur
performances, in Hobart and Launceston. Old men were
always his specialty, and he was very much better than
Lambert. Coppin and Neild will tell you that Rogers,
called the Farren of the Australias, was even better than
the greatest Farren.’
Ada Colley, who created so much excitement at Sydney
Tivoli, some time ago, was engaged for the Palace
Theatre, London, almost immediately on her arrival
there. The fair-haired songstress has been well taken
care of by the dr matic critics.

Treasurer Holder reckons, so far as is known
.pet, that South Australia for the year ended 30th June,
1897, will have a surplus of £5353 ; revenue, £2,628,352 ;
expenditure, £2,622,999. On the very last day of the
year over £60,000 was paid as probate duty on Thomas
Elder’s huge estate, otherwise there would have been a
deficit of £55,000, and a new accumulated shortage would
have been started in lieu of the one which has just been
unobtrusively dropped into the general debt. This shows
the unspeakable foolishness of the income-tax reduction
made 12 months ago. Thomas Elder won’t die again next
year to keep the finances square, and if the Kingston-
Holder Government cuts things so fine, the new deficit
will be bound to come shortly.

shortage by converting it into permaneut debt, and at
the same time puts away £2500 a year in reduction of the
new debt, is remarkable. Unless someone ties a ton
weight to it to keep it from going too fast the blessed
deficit will be actually paid off by the year 2200, if nothing
else happens in the interim.

Queensland revenue for the year was .£3,613,150,
and the expenditure £3,604,264, surplus £BBB6. But the
province also got through £1,148,341 of loan money—
about equal to the expenditure of the previous three
years put together, and presumably this has something
to do with the surplus. In Australia, so long as there is
loan money going about, the temptation to pay just
enough items out of it to make the revenue account
appear level is practically irresistible, especially as there
is practically no limit on the kip'* of items which a
Government may charge to loans.
* * * *
According to the figures in the Government
Gazette, N.S.W. revenue for the year ended 30th June,
1897, amounted to £9,309,269, and the expenditure is set
down as £9,480,214, so Premier Reid winds up with another
deficit of £170,945. Last year his deficit, according to the
Statistical Reoister’s figures, was £464,736, and for the
preceding half-year it was £365,784, so the aggregate Reid
deficit for 2J4 years reaches the handsome total of
£1,001,465. The best that can be said for it is that the
new shortage seems to be £58,000 less than was expected
a month or two ago. That Premier Reid will describe it
as a surplus may be assumed in advance ; that amazing
person called his last shortage of £464,000 a surplus of
£333,000, and when he intimated before going to England
that the year’s expenditure would probably be £229,000
more than the revenue be cheerfully described that as a
probable surplus of £104,000.
Premier Reid reckoned that the land-tax would
pan out for £330,000, but it only yielded £141,022. By
collecting two years’ income-tax in one year, however,
this source of revenue was made to yield £305,317. Next
year’s accounts, however, will only include one year’s in-
come-tax, and there seems to be no definite hope that the
land-tax will improve greatly, and some more customs
duties come off this month, so the Reid Govt, will re-
quire to hustle for more economies, or more revenue, or
both, if it doesn’t want things to be even worse in ’9B
than they are in ’97. Meanwhile the prospects of the
accumulated overdraft are not bright. It is eight years
since N.S.W. Govt, first began to pay off the old deficit
with one hand and to accumulate a new one with the
other, and still the new shortage keeps growing a great
deal faster than the old one is liquidated.
The expenditure out of revenue for ’97 was
apparently about £44,000 less than for ’96 (though
it is £300,000 more than in 1894), but as the expendi-
ture out of loans (£1,548,606) was £260,000 more,
and is the biggest since ’93, that probably accounts for it.
In nine cases out of ten the economical Treasurer who
cuts down ordinary expenditure simply does it by charg-
ing a lot of the items against loans, and when ordinary
expenditure goes down and loan expenditure goes up at
the same time, one usually explains the other. There-
fore, until these provinces either stopborrowingaltogether,
or else enact that only permanent works which yield direct
revenue shall be paid out of loan moneys, and that roads,
bridges, museums, statues to dead politicians, wood-
blocking streets, repairs to old bridges, wharves, dredges,
and the like, patches on the roofs of dilapidated public
buildings, and all other non-revenue-producing works
shall come out of revenue, there will never be honest or
solvent finance in Australia. The present system whereby
the Premier can charge to loans practically anything that
it isn’t convenient to pay out of revenue, and is limited
by no law whatever, is the chief reason why the finance
of the Seven Provinces comprises seven permanent stinks
of the worst description. Now and then a pro\ ince swears
off borrowing for a time, as in the recent case of Maori-
land and Victoria, and then its finance is moderately
honest for a year or two through want of loan moneys to
fake the accounts with, but otherwise the stink is chronic.

The Vic. Govt, has floated locally within the

The amalgamation of the National Mutual Life
Assurance Society with the Mutual of Victoria took effect
on Ist June, and the fact that there was thus one office less
competing for business in an overcrowded market was
viewed with satisfaction. The same month, however, a
British institution, the Scottish Metropolitan Co., came
in to fill the gap, so the numbers are about as they were.
This makes five foreign life-assurance concerns (two
British and three American) doing business in Australia,
and it seems quite probable that a time will come when
they will rush Australia as the foreign fire-companies
have done, with very similar results. The Scottish
Metropolitan is one of the baby insurance concerns which
swarm in Britain—a country whose insurance institutions
range from first-class down to awful. It is a proprietary
concern founded in 1876, and at the end of 1895, after 19
years’ work, it had accumulated a life assurance fund of
barely £272,000, so it may fairly claim to be one of the
slowest concerns now doing business in Australasia. What
it chiefly, prides itself upon is that it charges very nearly
the lowest premium rates on record ; in fact, they are so
low that it has alv ays been somewhat of a mystery how
the co. contrives to make them pay. One method by
which it seems to make ends meet is by reckoning future
interest on its accumulated funds at 4 per cent., whioh is
tolerably steep in a country where interest rates are so
low as they are in Britain. The best British offices esti-
mate future interest as low as 2*4 |per cent., and very few
indeed go above Even in Australia, where interest is
much higher than in England, the best offices are now
reducing their future estimates to 3J4.
* * * *
So far as The Bulletin oan ascertain, the
Scottish Metropolitan has paid no bonus on its life policies
for at least a dozen years, and its surplus seems to have
faded from £4030 in 1885 to £2342 in ’93. A surplus like
that leaves no margin worth speaking of for bonuses.
The Scottish Metropolitan spent in 1895 over 18 per
cent, cf its total income or about 21£ per cent, of its
premiums in working expenses and dividends to share-
holders, .yet at its last valuation it appears to have only
estimated the future expenses at 121 per cent., and even
then it pulled througli with a very small margin of
solvency. Altogether the new co. looks very small and
unprogressive, very expensively worked, very reckless in
the matter of charging sensationally low premiums, and
even though it reckons future interest at a dangerously
high rate and future expenses very low, it appears not
only unable to pay bonuses but to have a very narrow and
decreasing margin between its assurance fund and actual
insolvency.
• J here are many weird life assurance institutions
in Britain. The Yorkshire Provident, which in 24 years
has accumulated a fund of £3552, and apparently lost
most of the shareholders’ capital in doing it, is a fine
sample. The Victoria, 35 years old, and with £76,000
accumulated, is another. The Pioneer, five years old,
which spends 60 per cent, of its receipts in ex-
penses and has £936 saved up, is also an in-
teresting concern ; ditto the Law Property Co. whose
total assets are £69,000, the biggest being “ Accumulated
Deficiency, £61,000.” The absence of any State supervi-
sion makes the British insurance co. a thing’ which is by
no means to be taken for granted, and the worst British
co. is T a good many times worse than even the worst Aus-
traiian one. The very worst J. Bull assurance office could
drink all its assets and prospects in one respectable orgy.
The 1896 balance-sheet of the Mutual Life In-
surance Co. of New York is to hand. The premium
income for the year is £8,288,340, and the total income
£10,421,359. Out of this £3,051,450 is added to the accu-
mulated funds, making them £47,890,454—the biggest life
?. si ™ee fund in the world. The surplus of assets over
liabilities is now £6,105,444, being about half-a million
more than it was a year ago. This is arrived at by assum-
ing future interest at 4 per cent. ; if the rate was reduced
to the same level as that assumed by the A.M.P. Society
and Maoriland Government Department the surplus
would probably be between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000, but
even this is a very solid margin of security.
The worst feature about the Mutual of New York
is the very heavy expense rate, equal to nearly 25t0 per
cent, on premiums, or a little over 20 per cent, on total
assets. This is an exorbitant rate accordingto Australian
ideas. An item among the assets is “ Interest accrued
and due, £468,140” ; the Mutual, like several Australian
offices, follows the bad practice of lumping these together,
and the amount of arrears is not stated. As it is guaran-
teed by a State auditor, however, as absolutely sound
and above suspicion as regards its assets and its surplus
and its other figures, the omission in its case is of less
importance.

Apropos a soap trade-mark action in Mel-

sible rule that a mere adjective of common usage cannot
be employed as a trade-mark, even though it may get on

facturer can’t have protection against the trade for his
“Brilliant” candles, or “Matchless” matches, whereas
“ Samaritan ” ointment would be a safe thing to register.

B. H. Goodman, the London dentist who pro-

bankruptcy—debts, £61,548. Before this he had the

Balfour,” and his bod}' and blood asked for. He managed
to escape from the rear of the building. One of the co’s
“ trading ” operations consisted of sending cables to its
representative in W.A. to cable back as follows, etc., etc.
It was an awful business, but it would be an easy matter
to give a long list of newspapers who boomed the G.D.T.
Co., also the“ process,” which the Mining Standard sa.vs
“ created quite a sensation in Australia” But it never
did. It only created a lot of ridicule, and caused some

The curse of the limited liability mining law of England
is that it enables directors, who are usually paid-up
holders, to call up every shilling to sink in mines after
they have been proved duffers. The blessing of the Aus-
tralian no-liability law is that it enables contributing
shareholders to retire when they think they have had
enough.

charging 30,000 gallons a day. Then why in Heaven’s
name can’t they arrange to use some of it ? What has
become of the G.G. Extended ? Is the money still being
sunk in the mine, or are the directors, as stated some time

Kaufman, boss Westralian mining schemer, has'
got a bond on the Ivanhoe mine. It is now wired from
the camp that the rumor is, the Corporation represented
there by Kaufman intends also to buy the Great Boulder
and the Boulder Perseverance mines, which, with the
Lake View and the Ivanhoe would be formed into one big
co. of £20,000,000, and thus control the greatest gold-mine
in the world. This sounds thundery, but the chances
are against it. If Kaufman’s crowd make as much
money out of the Ivanhoe deal as by that of the Lake
View, not only must Kaufman be a genius in finance, but
the public must even be a bigger ass than The Bulletin
has hitherto imagined. In the Lake View, half the mine
was given away for £30,000 working capital, which by
the way, was never wanted. Big deals were also made in
b ,. ef< l re th . e _, bargain was fixed. In the Ivanhoe
is to be paid for three-fourths of the mine and
£40,000 to be provided as working capital. Of the two,
so far, the Lake View has proved the richer property As
the Ivanhoe shares have averaged about £9 for a year
they could not have been got very cheap in anticipation.’
Ihe yarn that London management is better, is all moon-
shine—much better, perhaps, for the management.
“The Boulder Perseverance is bagging telluride
ore rapidly, but has not yet commenced shipping. It is
intended to send the ore away on a large scale.” Perhaps

less than 100. Newspaper hummers might just as well
“ Hannan’s hundred acres is realising .£6OO a
Hionth by the sale of water to the public crushing company
and the Great Boulder.” By which it would seem that
the water trouble is rot entirely removed, and therefore
cheap mining- in most parts of Westralia is still along way

Dear Buli.etin, —The Jubilee illuminations in
Melbourne, conducted mainly by the Government and
city corporation., strike one as having been the jobbiest of
jobs. Other people’s money was poured into the coffers
of the gas and electric-lighting companies by these des-
potic wasters, some of whom themselves hold shares in
the aforesaid companies, and all of whom are favorably
inclined towards shareholders in general. Another pro-
tected concern that coined money from the illuminations
was the Tramways Co. The trams had the run of the
thronged streets whilst poor old cabby was driven out of
the city by special regulations.—Paul.

“ The Council of the Churches” put that
absurd person, N.S.W. Colonial Secretary
Brunker, on the Protestant ticket at Federal
election time and so secured his return as a
Federal delegate. Now, at the instigation of the
Council aforesaid, Brunker sools the police on the
little shopkeeper who commits the crime of selling
cakes, fruit and hop-beer to the workman who
takes his wife and children to Manly on his only
day of rest, Sunday. “You may sell meals to
people who eat them in your place,” says the
policeman to the shopkeeper, “but you must not
sell a cake or an orange to be taken away from
your shop. A purchaser may take away a bottle
of milk but not a roll of bread —that is the law.”

Sydney Morning Herald raises (in a

Gov. Buxton (S.A.), who is the most

the 20,000 children assembled in Adelaide on
Jubilee Day that if they were really good between
eight and 12 years of age they might all confi-
dently hope to be kings and queens at 18. At
least, if he didn’t mean that, his address meant
nothing, which, after all, would be quite charac-
teristic. One K.C.M.G., forgetting his Imperial
servitude for the moment, even went s(f far as to
describe His Ex. as a “ damned old ass ” when
commenting on his public Jubilee utterances.

Mayor Rogers, of Croydon (N.Q.), gave

and the gins banjed the banje of the full-and-

From a cablegram anent the free distribu-

Many touching scenes were witnessed, and many women

A Brisbane (Q.) bootblack, at 6, one after-

Last week the Anglican Diocese of Mel-

On the Saturday preceding the orthodox
week of rejoicing the Hobart Civil Service (in
response to a circular from heads of departments)
assembled in Franklin Square, and, after Treas.
Fysh had orated, shamefacedly howled “God

howl. Nobody sings “ Gorsave ” with any appear-
ance of dignity unless drunk. It was interesting
(says a Bulletin correspondent) to watch the
faces of the servants in the crowd prior to the
unmusical proceedings. Thpse of many depicted
a struggle between a desire to flee from the whole
ridiculous show, and a mortal fear of offending
their bosses. It was indeed a pitiful exhibition.

the scruff of the collar and dropped
him on the footpath. Just after-

In view of the recent hysterical shivoo it
would be a consistent and graceful act for the
united sects to celebrate the “Phosphorous
Jubilee ” of the Devil. According to orthodox
beliefs, Beelzebub is a personage most necessary

AUSTRALIAN DRY GIN.
Some years ago a young barrister, since
highly distinguished in law, politics, and litera-
ture, arrived in Sydney. He didn't then know as
much as he knows now, and so it happened that
in an interval of loud silence at a fashionable
dinner-party everyone heard him say that “ The
Bulletin is a most enjoyable paper—by far the
most interesting published here, 1 think.” At once
he perceived his mistake ; host and guests looked
—well, they looked as an execution crowd looks
when it is waiting for the body to fall through the
trap. “ You will pardon me, sir,” at length said
a venerable M.L.C., who was of the company,
“ but as a new-comer you probably do not know
the paper mentioned quite so well as those who
have lived longer here. You will find, on further
acquaintance with it, that it is a most disreputable
print. Why, do you know ’’—continued the
ancient, his voice sinking to an awed and reveren-
tial whisper —“ that it.actually makes disparaging
remarks about the Prince of Wales ! ” Yet
around that table there wasn’t even the ghos 4 - of a
smile.

stated that he struck water
which “had a distinctly spirit-

site of the future Australian
capital. It might have been

In a certain Australian province, where a
hanging job seems to be now pending, the authori-
ties recently had a week’s search to find the hang-
man. He was eventually run to earth in a back
alley, where his wife and three other “ladies”
were engaged pounding him with a spade and
other articles. As the job probably comes off in
two or three weeks time, he has been sentenced to
one month for “ riotous behaviour and indecent
language ” so as to guarantee that the execution
wm be performed satisfactorilv and with credit to
the department. Further, both the gentlemen’s
eyes ar e at present closed, and unless Nature is

A lady bearing the front names of Maud
JBiVa, who was divorced in Sydney last week by

teries of this country. Maud Eva was married
unknown to her friends, and, after the ceremony

he had to go and make a home for her, but would
send for her in a few days. In about six weeks he
casually dropped her a postcard. Five months
wuv he called and took her for a walk down
William-street, and left her at the corner again.
About three years later she saw him coming out of
a house, but they didn’t speak. That was the
whole extent of their married life, and Judge

casualness of it all, decided that the defendant
married Maud Eva simply to prevent the church

to arise through one of the parties seeing a church
that isn’t in use at the moment, and feeling a

would want to prod a sleeping dog to see how long

. Samarai (New Guinea) is such a small
island that a capable “lepper” can traverse its
diameter in a hop-step-and-a-jump. And what
troubles the unconventional boys there now is that
—there are 14 white women on it! There is one
hotel, built originally for a small family. But
it has at its rear a “native house.” where all-
comers must camp-along with the fowls, which
roost aloft. The nominal accommodation capa-
dty of the “native house ” is up to 10; the real
limit is as many as come ! At the morning
toilet, each male who has stripped gets a blush-
big consciousness that his hairy legs are visi-
hie to everybody in “ the kitchen.” Scoot-
ing round the corner in search of
privacy, he cannons against several ladies
puddling at washtubs. Fleeing round the
hotel, he debouches into the main street
an s* meets the reproachful gaze of more
aghast females. So he rushes inside the “ hotel,”
and finishes trousering himself under a table, and
also under the gaze of native women, who stare at
ns movements as if he were a prize lunatic. It
takes the hardening mill of time to make a modest
male (and Northern diggers are nothing if not
modest before beyvchus woman) used to the public
performance of his toilet in Samarai.

At Cairns (where the whites take off their
hats to the Chows) recently, an application was
read from the sanitary contractor requesting that
his contract be transferred to one Archie Lock.
Now it happened that Archie Lock was a pure-
blooded Caucasian, but Cairns is so accustomed to
find the Chow an all-pervading element that
aldermen interpreted the name as Ah Chee Lok.
Hence ensued a furious discussion on the ad-
visableness of letting contracts to Chows, and
trouble seemed likely to arise until the aldermen
were fully seized of the astounding fact that the
party in question was not a Chow, and that all
European contractors had not died out, &c., &c.

Messrs. E. Cusenier and Co., of Cognac,
France, have now put on the Australian market
their famous Grand Supreme brandy, a liquor
which has a splendid reputation in Europe and
America, but which has hitherto been in short
supply in this country. The Grand Supreme is
reputed, where it is best known, to be the finest
brandy in the world, and the Australian demand
for it will assuredly be large and constant.*
A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, July 6, 1897.
Mr Deak Myee—•
A glance round St. John’s Church, Darling-
hurst, on Wednesday of last week, when the
handsome and popular Miss Nellie Hill became
the wife of Mr. E. P. Rundle, instantly assured
one that the floral decoration of the edifice had
been undertaken by the “girl friends of the
bride.” The professional and artistic touch in
arrangement was entirely missing. White moir6
antique, an exquisite fabric, but one which always
suggests the early Victorian era of drooping curls
and spreading crinolines, comprised the bridal
costume. The advantage this material has over
almost any other is that it imperatively does away
with trimmings and fixings of any sort. On this
occasion, the fascinating “waterings” in the
material clearly asserted themselves, for the well-
out skirt fell in unbroken lines ; some full puffings
of chiffon on the sleeves, and some sprays of
orange-flowers on the bodice, constituted the whole
garniture. Among the guests, not more than
half-a-dozen were arrayed in wedding garments,
and winter gowns that had seen half a season’s
hard wear, and were beginning to show it, were
mostly sported. A recently-travelled blonde,
however, in an unmistakably French gown and
toque, furnished a refreshing contrast, and seemed
to bring to the sombre-looking assemblage a whiff
of gay Paree.
Persons who possess that quaint fad, a desire to
search out the influence of bodily coloring on
character and temperament, should not overlook
the fact that three of the best singers Australia
has produced up-to-date—Crossley, Florence
Schmidt, and Eva Mylott—have auburn tresses, and
are, by the way, all three pretty well of the same
build. Miss Mylott certainly takes her place now
in the front rank of warblers. On Saturday night,
at the Jules Simonsen benefit concert, she sang
“ Out on the Rocks,” the only song apparently
ever written for a contralto, and managed artisti-
cally to insert a soul under the bare ribs of that
worn-out dirge. Jules Simonsen, who seemed far
more at ease in faultless dress clothes and
smoothly-plastered hair than he did in the
mysterious grey small clothes and the wild and
woolly wig oif II Trovatore, was in fine voice. Jules
holds a world’s record for being the only male
Warbler to whose cheek applause brings the shy
and modest blush. It would be interesting to
observe how long he will be able to retain this
fascinating failing on the wicked continent.
The wedding of Miss May Wedderburn and Mr.
Lawrence Campbell took place on Wednesday,
30th inst. The church was thronged with specta-
tors whose, chattering spoiled much of the effect
of the beautifully-rendered choral service. The
back seats were principally filled with nurse-girls
with their arms full of large, fat baby, who
punctuated the prayer and praise with emphatic
howls. The bride, attended by two prettily-
dressed little girls, wore her travelling gown of
steel-grey bengaline and carried a large and
spreading posy of bridal flowers. After the cere-
mony, afternoon tea and speeches were served at
“ Heathfield,” the residence of the bride’s sister,
where a glittering array of highly-polished wed-
ding gifts were displayed.
The omission of the word ‘‘obey” from the
bride’s oath at a recent smart Sydney wedding
was the most conspicuous and most widely-dis-
cussed feature of the ceremony. The fair bride
raised her eyes and nervously watched the face of
the “ joiner ’’ when he began the “ say after me,”
and when he at last came to the important word,
balked at it, and finally “cleared it without
touching,” something which on a face less fair
would have been called a broad grin pervaded the
bride’s features. The bridegroom, who seemed
rather painfully conscious all the time of his bright
tight boots, generously returned the grin as if he
had no further use for it, and became preternatur-
ally grave.
As Madame Pailliard, in “ A Night Out,” Miss
Alma Stanley presents an object-lesson to all
beholders in the matter of what colors and styles
to avoid when choosing raiment for the merry
spring-time. On her towering six foot of figure
she manages to combine such a vast aggregation
of smart, fashionable hideousness that one’s eye-
balls are seared, and it is a positive relief to gaze
at the red-and-green check gown and scarlet bon-
net of Madame Pinglet, which in comparison
seems quite sombre and, colorless. On a mar-
vellous headpiece, worn in ; the third act, vivid!
greens and pinks and purples and heliotropes are
wildly flung together like an upset paint-box.
This nightmare of millinery is worn with a
gown which suggests an undried tea-cloth, and
looks as if it had been hastily pinned round the
wearer by someone in the wings. The “ pro-
perty ” black-and-steel gown of the second; act—
the bodice of which, with net sleeves attached,
seems a mere afterthought—is the smartest-looking
garment in the play, if the really artistic frocks of
Mathieu’s four daughters are excepted ; and Miss
Stanley goes to some trouble to emphasise the fact
that with it she wears black silken petticoats and
stockings. It grieves Cecil Ward’s numerous ad-
mirers to notice that his favorite action of rubbing
the top of his head when he is in doubt has
scratched away a little bald spot, which is be-
coming rapidly more visible.
On Thursday evening, at the Govt. Hons®
shivoo given in honor of visiting sheep-breeders,
it was noted with disgust by many members of
our “first families ” that the visiting-book wasn’t
as freely expurgated as of yore. The hard-and-
fast rules ignoring “ trade ” as a social factor were'
set aside, and haughty squatteresses and; bank-
manageresses rubbed shoulders with plebeians whc
retail tea and do other disgusting things. By the
way, there has been much talk, concerning the
dinner-table exploit of a sheep-breeders’ official
who, publicly taking up a collection for-next year’s'
show-prizes, asked Gov, Hampden, in presence of
the assembled company, whether he (the official)
understood that H.E. wished to rise with a sub-
scription. The Governor gave ten guineas, and!
was amiable enough not to resent the unprece-
dentedly familiar style in which.he was “hustled.”'
The trouble at St. Mark’s is over by the appoint-
ment of the Rev. Willoughby Flower, Archdeacon.
of Grafton, a clergyman of the popular variety.
He has a reputation for brains, and is “just right ”
in his views—knows exactly the proper width of a
chasuble’s hem and the proper time for placing
red and purple on the altar vases. After all their
tempestuous discussions, the congregation will
now rise and gratefully sing the hymn ending with
the lines
The bud may have a bitter taste
But sweet will be the Flower.
Gas struck work erratically on .Jubilee night
and with patchy effect. On one building, flaring
with the usual device and star, the words of fire
blazed forth as “ Australian Widows Fun ”
(Fund). Visitors from the back-blocks thought
the idea rather a good one that. while_ one English
widow was jubilating, Australian widows should
be taking the taste of bereavement out of their
mouths by having a little fun of their own.
This week (Thursday, Bth) the first Pleyel
Chamber Music Concert will be given at Pleyel
House. Violinist Staell leads the. “ strings,”
Sydney Moss plays the piano; Miss Blanche
Thomas, an effective contralto —yet another ruddy-
haired vocalist —will also assist. There has been
good booking for the opening' of this series, which
is attracting much interest among musical people.
A “ Record Reign ” March, by Eliza Longfield,
beginning with joy-bell effects, and meandering
into “Home, Sweet Home,” somehow reminds me
of the cruise of the “ Fiery Dragon ” on Jubilee
night.
The bestowal of a P.C.-ship on her untitled
husband is said to be extremely vexing to one
Premier’s wife, because the wives of P.O.’s don't
come into the table of precedence at all unless
hubby has already a handle to his name. She
would rather he had been dubbed “ Sir,” and then
she would be “ Lady,” and entitled to sail into
swell dinner-parties ahead of other women who
had previously assumed a far-distant expression
whenever she was around. The cablegram last
week deprived all the knightly-husbanded pre-
mieresses now at ’Ome of their handle, and they
all figured without distinction as plain “ Missis.”
At a R.C. Church, the other day, a bridal
party arrived at 7.30 a.m., and had the knot tied
at that early hour. What the bride and bride-
groom will have to do during the honeymoon is to
keep away from' remarking that “the earlybird
catches the worm.” For who is bird and who is
worm ?
A thanksgiving Jubilee demonstration was given
by the “ working girls of Sydney,” at Sydney
Town Hall, the other evening. Guvment ’Ouse
sent its contingent to preside, and no alleged
males, except the harmless and reliable clergy,
were admitted. Miss Lilian Frost took charge of
the organ, and sounded deep pedal notes to keep
feminine tongues in order occasionally : and when
a scrimmage at one end of the hall took place, the
Town Hall officials (men) were sent for ; then the
row subsided.
Customers of a certain solid bank, at an im-
portant mining centre, are accustomed to transact
biz. through clouds of smoke. It is a common
thing to see a lady waiting at the counter for
•change of a cheque and the teller counting it
cigar-in-mouth, while the accountant, sitting above
him, is also puffing vigorously.
Attending cooking-class is a prevalent winter
■craze in Melb. just now. The “professor ” is
■eloquent and competent, adopts the Socratic
method, and teaches by question and answer the
group of three or four score pupils whom he
attracts in different suburbs. “ Ladies,” he
queries appealingly, “ do you boil your ’am ? ” A
novice asks, blushingly, “What else should we do
with it?” The oracle smiles pityingly, “Oh,
never boil your ’am; bake your ’am.” Then he
explains the process while note-books are busy.
Again a question comes : “ Ladies, ’ow do you try
potatoes ? ” “A knife ? ” suggests a murmur from
the back row. “ No, not a knife ” —the teacher’s
manner is bland, but intense, with expressive
throwing up of hands—“ Never a knife, ladies;
take a ’at-pin.”
The children’s fancy-dress ball, to be held on
15th July in the Town Hall, is expected to raise
substantially the fund for the Consumptive Home,
which, despite the efforts of many energetic
workers, still languishes on the wrong side of
,£5OOO. Melb. has raised more than several times
that sum for its little jubilee charity flutter in the
same space of time, and Melb. considers itself
still in low water financially. But when a fund
has to be raised locally it is invariably, though un-
intentionally, bungled from the start bycliqueism.
The Nicest run the affair, and run it exclusively,
■or else the committee falls to pieces* before it is
fairly in working order through the intense
horror which one of the Nicest feels at seeing.her
name on the same list as that of some unmention-
able and unknowable woman who runs a sausage-
shop or a bakery. Too much Darling Point
swamps every charitable appeal. It is rough on
the exclusive appealers, because on them falls the
brunt of subscribing to every new fund which they
initiate. On them does it hail collecting-cards and
ball-tickets, and often are the boxes rattled at
street corners.
Meanwhile the public, out of earshot of the con-
fidential murmurs of high-toned committee meet-
ings, goes its own way, and the shillings and half-
crowns which the fund urgently requires re-
main still in the pockets of many who would
give the money but for a vague notion that a
fund engineered by the “toffs’’will be attended
to entirely by the “ toffs.” The churches know a
much better way of raising money. Were they to
depend on high pew-rents and large donations
from the wealthy and would-be wealthy they
would soon cease building altogether. It is the
steady influx of sixpences and shillings from
Bridget Maloney, the cook, and her class, that
pays the piper. What all local fashionable
■ charities need is to get at Bridget Maloney.
I hear that at a recent race-meeting Tocumwaj
'(N.S.W.) way, some aristocratic young bloods
amused themselves by hacking each other’s clothes
to pieces; and, while waiting for slop-made gar-
ments to come from the nearest store, arrayed
themselves *in potato sacks and danced a wild,
hilarious, and high-kicking can-can, winding up
this interesting performance by pouring cham-
pagne over eaqh other.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent: —
“ ‘ My friend from India,’Miss Alma Stanley,
in her drawing-room dance, upheld the theory
■current in every ball-room, that the larger the
person the lighter the foot. In these days of stage
magnificence, of silk linings, lace petticoats, and
superlative slippers, it was -surprising to detect
that the dancer’s shoe-soles \ had lost their first
freshness, and that a non-dpeorative selvage or
rough edge on its inner side marred the whirl of
her black skirt. \
“ Quite a number of Australian husbands went
’Ome ‘on business’ last year, and managed to
shilly-shally in London until over the Jubilee.
The wives, of course, saw through the move at the
time, and fought tooth-and-nail for a joint trip.
Some gained their point, others were less lucky.
In consequence, there are ip |Melb. at the present
i moment a host of disappointed matrons, hitherto
dutiful wives, who now breathe naught but
vengeance against their absent lords, protesting
how cheaply it could have been managed if only
Z had had the spirit of a mouse. Some
women, not such very big guns either, took court-
trains from Melb. in case of emergency. You. can
get one at a certain big cheap firm on this side of
the world for £2O. In London, especially in the
thick of a “ tail ” boom, you would give <£loo for
practically the same garment.
“ The awful system of royalising his Excel-
lency and party when supper-time arrives—a sys-
tem, by the way, which their exalted Excellencies,
emulating Greater People, inflict upon their own
guests at their own Government ’Oases —was
bound to be dragged into ridicule by inferior poten-
tates. The mayoress of a remote Melbourne
suburb gave a reception in the local ’all, the other
week. Her bounding ambition didn’t bound quite
as high as an invite to Lord. 8., but the worthy
matron produced two dazzling trump-cards in the
Mayor of Melbourne and a Cabinet minister.
These were not less great in her circle than the
Governor is great in his circle, and accordingly she
invited a ‘ select few ’ to join them in a special re-
fresh-room, shut out from the common herd, who
were left to refresh themselves at a buffet. The
common herd, professing to feel much hurt by this
social distinction, promptly withdrew from the
building in single file. They marched out snorting.
“ But, why ? The same sort of thing is done at
Government House, where the visitors are Lady
Brassey’s guests to more than the same degree
that ordinary visitors at a reception are guests of
the Mayoress who holds it. If it be right for the
vice-regals to grovel to their own greatness, in
addition to accepting grovel from other hosts, why
can’t a suburban councillor’s wife be allowed to
bow down before her municipal Sovereign—the
Mayor of Melbourne? A society that tolerates
court etiquette at second-hand has no right to
kick against any display of snobbery. If his Ex-
cellency at one end of the town is entitled to erect
himself and family on a platform, the boss Mayor
starring at the other end of the town seems by no
means incompatible with refreshments for a Select
Few.
“The first of the subscription concerts by the
Howard Conservatoire of Music (Melb.) was a
good show of students’ ability rather than a popu-
lar entertainment. During the interval, Gov.
Brassey unburdened himself of some laudatory
comments, after which the ancient mariner and
party toddled off without waiting for part 11.
The second half of the programme, as it happened,
was better suited to a rather sassiety audience
than the first half, wherein a Beethoven sonata
for the pianoforte had outstayed its welcome by
several minutes, for Beethoven, in his severe
moods, presses heavily upon the common or gar-
den kind of Philistine. One or two other numbers
were long enough, yet not too long to be likeable.
A string quartette performance of Schubert’s
‘ Death and the Maiden ’ was pleasant, in spite of
many imperfections, and the violin soli by clever
Miss May Nash (who was painfully nervous) and
Miss Guenett gave promise of laurels in store for
both young artists.
“ Apropos of feminine excitement as manifested
in the Jubilee crushes, sufferers, who felt them-
selves deliberately and viciously kicked on the
shins by flustered females, are still wearing the
bruises. One spitfire broke her umbrella over the
shoulders of a stout patriarch, remarking explana-
torily that fat people were best at home. In the
human whirlpool which surged nightly at the junc-
tion of Collins and Swauston streets two well-
dressed women looked for a moment like tearing
one another’s eyes out. One had accused the other
of ‘ digging ’ her with her ‘ razor elbows.’
“ The wife of the Premier of another province
was lionised in a mild way during her recent stay
in Melbourne. One of her hostesses, by way of
accentuating her guest’s importance, rustled about
lamenting in gushful whispers to the rest of the
company that ‘ Mrs. Z. was a trifle difficile, but
one must excuse it in the idol of “X.”’ (“X.”
standing for the Australian capital usually in-
habited by the alleged “ idol.”)
“ The recent ball at Govt. House was like its
forerunners —a suffocating crush. Two thousand
guests would have been a tight fit at any time,
but on this occasion ever so much of the available
space was railed off for the vice-regal party, which
made matters even worse than usual.
“ Proud parents no longer keep back the young
and tender debutante until a vice-regal dance
affords a suitable opportunity for her to blossom
forth. She and her frock get more battered under
gubernatorial auspices than anywhere else, and,
as a matter of fact, experienced ball-goers now
reserve the ugly ducklings of their wardrobe for
Govt. House festivities.
“ Women are notoriously bad shots. In W.A.,
the other day, a mine - manager’s wife was
christening an engine and had to throw a cham-
pagne-bottle at it. It was somewhat larger than
the proverbial haystack, and she was only a couple
of yards from it, yet she cleverly managed to miss
it and hit her hubby—-a portly person—below the
belt, knocking him into a cistern ten feet deep and
badly hurting him.
“ A few weeks ago a relay of relic/ieuses inau-
gurated as a new convent what was lately the
palatial residence of a boomster. The Mother
Superior, when going over the mansion, dis-
covered certain pagan and unholy designs in the
fresco of the front room, which she required the
agent to have painted over that very day. Later
on the good nun was horrified, when raising her
heavenwards in her mid-day devotions, to
find little naked oupids in flesh tints disporting on
the Arcadian ceiling. Sending at once for the
agent, she locked the door, and guarded the cham-
ber of horrors till the painter and factotum had
arrived on the scene. Holy water was then used
to rid the air of all impurities.
“A stranger in Kalgoorlie (W.A.) was puzzled
to hear strains of ‘ On the Benches in the Park ’
and ‘ Her Golden Hair ’ proceeding from the
Church of England building. On investigating
the matter he learnt that a social club hires the
sacred edifice for its fortnightly dances and sup-
pers. Things ecclesiastical do not boom in the
Golden West—tho Australian left to his own
devices is not a church-going animal. One of the
most money-making concerns in Kalgoorlie at
present is undertaking. The local ‘ planter ’
makes a clear profit of £lOO per month. He had
quite 50 funerals during the month of May.
“ One of the queerest figures seen on the Block
for some time is a golden-haired charmer who
sports a marvellously-long, woolly black cape in
which she looks for all the world like a prize collie.
Her gold nob just shows at the back, between a
drooping feathered hat and the great collar, and
the front view acquaints you with a sharp-featured,
powdered face through a black, trellis-work veil.
The effect of this figure in locomotion, with its
skirt-tail wagging and its head pointing from side
to side, is too funny. Old-stagers remember no-
thing so startling since Kate Foote, the tall
Gaiety girl, some four years ago, used to patrol
Collins-street in a plain, grey, cowboy felt hat
and a huge overcoat, in the pockets of which she
was wont to thrust her ungloved hands.
“ In a recent local housebreaking case a second-
hand dealer gave evidence that he ran what
practically amounted to a circulating ‘ library ’
in clothes. In his suburb, he said, ‘no leddies in
serciety liked ter wear the same things alius.
And consequently they paid him ss. a month for
the privilege of varying the pink blouse in which
they appeared at the local football club’s hop, with
a glorious confection of ostrich feathers and ribbons
for Saturday night wear, and a pea-green dolman
with big pearl buttons in which to scintillate when
they take their seats on the lorry booked for the
racecourse. The principle is excellent and capable
of almost illimitable extension.
Yours affectionately, Cleo.
In reference to a story by Henry Lawson,
in last issue of The Bulletin, it seems desirable
to make it clear that no reference was made, or
could possibly have been made, to Mr. Felix
Sehmellitscheck, the proprietor of the Foreign
Agency Co., at 82 Pitt-street, Sydney, and a gen-
tleman whose kindness in giving his services as a
musician in the cause of charity has made him
widely known and respected.
In the special Anglican Jubilee church
service the British are boldly spoken of as the
chosen race. Moses’ nose is right out of joint.
When murderer Butler was caught, there
was much nervousness among the sects, notone of
which desired him to claim it as his own. In a
word, none of the sects, which are supposed to
rejoice in the repentance of sinners, wanted the
Glenbrook butcher to pray in its yard. Mr.
Butler seems to have at last selected a ghostly
comforter. He says he is a Wesleyan.
Melb. : “ Coining home from the theatre,
last night, I was astounded to find in a gravestone-
yard, corner of Lonsdale and Exhibition streets, a
replica of the Ormond statue, which adorns the
front of Ormond College. I was as ‘ took-a-back ’
as Don Giovanni encountering the Commandant.
This replica is on a nice granite plinth, or pedestal,
which has borne an inscription, now rubbed out,
so that, returning by daylight, I could faintly
distinguish ‘ Ormond,’ with some undecipherable
catalogue of virtues. Then I made haste to assure
myself that the real Maginnis, at the college, had
not walked down off his perch.”
Church religion was revealed in a new and
nteresting light at a Melbourne inquest the other
day. Hear the seven-year-old son of deceased :
“Mrs. Blank told her husband there was poison
in the box and she intended to take it. He said,
‘ Well, take it.’ She emptied the contents of the
box into her mouth, and then threw the box itself
into the fire. Next, she drank some milk from a
jug, and became sick. During this time Blank
was sitting in the kitchen. He saw Mrs. Blank
take the poison, but did not see her vomiting. He
put on his hat and coat, and, having kissed wit-
ness and the second child, went to church.”
Quite a scene occurred in Melb. City Court,
the other day, when two “ respectable ” women
were charged with shoplifting—on five separate
charges, each from different shopkeepers—the
value of goods stolen being nearly <£lB. Lawyer
M‘Kean pleaded most ardently for his clients,
and finally his voice became broken and he
burst into tears. Then magistrate Panton
arose to remark that the bench was sworn to
“ administer justice without fear or favor,” and
that it was necessary to “make an example,” and
“ to pass over a succession of crimes was impos-
sible,” and so forth ; and then he sentenced them
to one week’s imprisonment—which, as they had
been under remand for more than that time,
meant immediate release. Great onions !
The jubilee served various Governments as
an excuse to get rid of some awkward problems.
The M.L. Ministry has been troubled for seven
years with the body of Louis Chemis, sentenced
in 1889 for a murder which almost everybody is
convinced he didn’t commit. It lately established
a court of appeal, and the act was intended to
allow Chemis a new trial and dispose of him that
way, but, by a stupid mistake, it was so drafted
that he didn’t come within its provisions. After
that the Government, lacking the moral courage
to give Chemis a free discharge, let things slide,
till the Jubilee came around. It then ejected him
from prison suddenly as an expression of loyalty,
and got rid of the difficulty that way. Still, it
might have done worse. The N.S.W. Govern-
ment, for instance, refused to reconsider Suffield’s
case even at Jubilee time, and Suffield was con-
victed upon evidence which almost proved his
innocence.
The painfully platitudinous E. J. H. Knapp
is at it again in the Sydney dailies, with a weirdly
incoherent assertion by an “ eminent barrister ”
that the cursed drink is at the bottom of nearly
all the divorces. But marital incompatibility is,
as often as not, in turn, at the bottom of the in-
temperance, and Knapp picks up the chain of
causation just where it comes handy for the silly
press screed beloved of Knapp and all his vvooden-
witted kind. Knapp isn’t calculated to illuminate
any subject, even if he knew what he was talking
about, but this is a case in which outsiders don’t
see most of the game, and Knapp, as a celibate
and teetotaller, is as gratuitous a circumstance as
the prurient old tabby who vexes her vinegar soul
about an “ age of consent ” which could never
have concerned her personally.
Dear Bulletin,— ln giving judgment in
favor of Mr. Norton, claimant in the interpleader
case of Allen v. Willis, N.S.W. Justice Simpson,
while correctly deciding the main point at issue,
said :
Parliament never intended that if a verdict was ob-
tained against one person or company, execution could
be made upon somebody else.
I would submit that in certain cases this is just
what Parliament did intend to do, and what Par-
liament has done. If A prints a libel with B’s
plant, then plaintiff can levy on B’s plant— as long
as B owns it. The words of the Act are that the
damages may be levied out of the plant “belong-
ing to the person whose types have been used . . .
as well as out of the property of the defendant on
the record.” The last phrase clearly points to
some person other than the one against whom
judgment has been obtained. —Rus. Roberts.

Joshua Bearn, the Streaky Bay (S.A.)
Butler, shortly to be hanged, was arrested when
in company with a half-caste mate, one “Buck-
akin,” who now tremblingly recalls that one night
he awoke to find someone walking about the
camp. He looked around and found Beard com-
ing towards him with uplifted axe. “ What you
doing, Mr. Beard ? ” Beard dropped the axe.
“ It’s all right, Buckskin—I’ve been cutting
sheoak,” said Joshua. Buckskin now says he is
afraid Beard was going to mistake him for a
sheoak-tree and thus add him to his little list of
accidents.
Said that C. G. Tegetmeier
will succeed Henry M'Kenzie as
general manager of the B.N.Z.
Tegetmeier is a native of Lon-
don, and graduated in the Lon-
don office. It is chronicled that
he is related to Walter Bagehot.
Prophet S. L. Rimmer,
speaking at Auckland on June
9, fixed the date of Christ’s
second coming for March of ’9B
—he was not particular to a
•day. If Christ should come
then, the first business to be
done would be to effectually
wipe out the prophet Rimmer
for disclosing State secrets. If
the Advent does not come off,
then the prophet should be torn
to pieces by the faithful. But
when next March comes Rimmer
will be all right he’ll have
“skipped,” either to America,
where apostle Worthington came
from, or to the nether regions.
Nankivell, the Vic. artist
who has had such a brilliant
career in Yankeeland, is a Prah-
ran native, and about five years
ago was a prominent figure in
local cricket circles, being cap-
tain of the Menindie Club.
Starved out of Australia, Nan-
kivell went to America, and in
a few weeks had the public at
his feet with his clever imita-
tions of prominent black-and-
white artists. With all his ex-
cellent draughtsmanship, Nan-
kivell is destitute of any style of
his own, but he can hit off an
imitation of Phil May, Beards-
ley, or Gibson, three men of
utterly distinct methods, with
such skill as to baffle the closest
observers.
The Ean of Hardwicke, who would have
been made Governor of Queensland had not the
Ministry heard that he was a broken-down turf
plunger, is dead. He was chiefly remarkable for
the splendor of his hats ; no other mortal man
ever succeeded in getting his tile to shine like the
Earl of Hardwicke’s. To whom he has imparted
the secret, or whether it has been buried with him,
the cable sayeth not. When Fauntleroy, the
London banker,, was about to be hanged for
forgery, two fashionables of his set visited him in
the condemned cell. “To morrow,” said one of
them, “you will appear before your God. Now
that the secret can no longer avail you aught, tell
us, we implore you, where you used to buy that
matchless curaejoa ? ”
Two eminent Tasmanians celebrate their
birthdays this month. Mrs. Humphrey Ward
will be 46 on July 12, and Federal Conventionist
W. A. Trenwith will be 50 on July 16.
Thomas Elder’s will paid £60,000 probate

Which justifies Solomon’s remark that Treas.

Lyons, who was crippled for life when bravely
trying to arrest the (since hanged) burglar Mont-
gomery three years ago, is starving with his wife

editors :

Et cetera.
Judge Moles worth appeared as witness in
a police-court case in Melbourne the other day, and
was so discursive in the box that he was several
times sternly commanded to “ keep to the point ”
by the perky counsel for the defence. Which goes
to show that it is easier to be a Judge than a
witness.
Died recently, a Mr. Edward Baly, one of
the pioneer teachers of Sydney. His own early
tutor was Robert Lowe. His early pupils included
John Kinloch, Consett Stephen, W. C. Windeyer,
and John Lackey. Through Lowe’s recommenda-
tion he obtained the head-mastership of Sydney
Grammar School.
Poor Ninian Melville, who died the other
day, was usually badly treated by reporters. Com-
ing out of Parliament one night, he ran against a
particularly obnoxious member of that craft.
“ Could you tell me,” said Melville, vindictively,
“ how to get an ounce of lead into a reporter
without breaking the law ? ”
The officers of the department, says N.S.W.
Just-ice Minister Ghould, are quite free from culp-
able negligence in re the severance, per rope, of
hanged murderer Moore’s neck. “ There seems,”
says the Minister, “to have been an unavoidable
error of judgment.” Probably the frozen one
means an error of execution.
London Spectator hails Henry Lawson as
“ the greatest Australian writer.” There is some
Spectator reviewer who keeps an eye on Aus-
tralian books. When Dr. Pearson was alive, he
used to do Australian subjects for the paper, being
a close personal friend of Meredith Townsend,
editor Hutton’s right-hand man.
Mrs. Jacob (wife of Mr. A. H. Jacob,
Chairman of Committees in N.S.W. Leg. Council)
died last week after a very long illness. Her
father, Col. Snodgrass, ruled as Acting-Governor
of both N.S.W. and Tasmania. He was reputed
in each Government to be a soldier of the old
type—a fighter first and reasoner after.
Premier Reid furnishes another proof of
the fact that the late Mr. J. Caesar knew what he
was talking about when he said, “ I would have
men about me that are Fat! ” Fat is Force —
fuel—reserve-energy. All Georgy-Porgy ever did
by way of exercise was—like Oscar Wilde —“a
little talking, now and then,” and he has more go
in him, at the right time, than any dozen of your
“lean and hungry-looking” Cassiuses. Wilde,
by-the-way, nearly died when most of his adipose
was treadmilled away, and got back fat and health
pari-passd.
THEIR VERSION.
LADY BUTTERKEG (horrified at her son playing with common
boys): “ Algernon! Algernon !” (Algernon, enjoying
himself, doesn’t answer.)
COMMON BOY : “ Hey, Stinker, yer mother wants yer !”
During the fearful hurricane encountered
by the s.s. Aberdeen en voyage to London, a re-
markable incident occurred. A big sea caught the
captain and washed him overboard and out of
sight. Then another sea swept him back again on
to the deck almost as good as new.
A LESSON IN PLAIN ENGLISH.
SIDNEY LAWYER (in Tasmania, to native): “Who is it, pray, resides in the

Lee Steere, Speaker of W.A. Assembly,
was 67 years old on July 4. He is a stately old
gentleman and belongs to a family which has
shown its love for its native land by continuously
retaining in its possession the estate in Surrey
granted to the original Lee Steere by William the
Norman more than 800 years ago.
It is possible that Gov. Brassey will not go
’Ome in the Sunbeam in November, as he had at
first intended. He wants to take a trip to the
South Seas —possibly to look at Louis Becke’s
brown girls. He has not made up his mind yet,
but anyhow says that he has no sort of intention
of giving up the Yic. Governorship before his time
expires.
The Colonial Office intimated in a despatch
to one of the Australian viceroys recently, that
they could not consider the claims of Austra-
lian newspaper proprietors, as such, to Imperial
distinctions, but that there must be some outside
service to entitle them to special recognition.
Well, isn’t Mister James president of the
Y.M.C.A ?
On Jubilee day, at Maitland, Colonial
Secretary Brunker, acting-chief of the N.S.W.
Ministry, “stated that he had provided medals
for the children as souvenirs of the occasion, and
also commemoration cards to which was attached
his autograph signature of ‘James N. Brunker,
Actiflg Premier,’ an announcement which was re-
ceived with applause.” Glory!
A recent -telegram from Broken Hill
announced that Moses M‘Nabb was in some diffi-
culty or other, and later news from Melbourne
Btates that Captain M‘lsaac has been mixed up in
a collision. If Donald O’Aaron is run over by a
cab shortly it will be about a fair thing. From
what possible region in the Highlands do the
M‘lsaacses come ?
An alleged centenarian lady who died at
Brunswick (Melb.), the other day, left two
daughters and 30 great-grandchildren, but no
g.g.-grandchildren. Interesting to know at what
age she was married and became a mother. Queen
Victoria, should she live, will probably be photo-
graphed with a g.g.g.-child on her lap long before
she reaches the nineties.
“ Alfred F. Culvert,” says M.L. Graphic,
“ was reputed to be worth 4500,000 in cash a year
ago. At that time a British and French syndicate
offered him 41,000,000 for his gold-mine holdings.
The offer was refused, and a course of reckless ex-
travagance was entered upon. Lately Mr. Calvert
has sold for 470,000 the properties that he refused
41,000,000 for a year ago.”
It would appear that, in any case, Railway-
Commissioner Eddy had not long to live. “He
had unmistakable symptoms of Bright’s disease, he
had had a sharp attack of pneumonia, and he was
beginning to be troubled with rheumatism and
gout. He was in the prime of life, being only 44
years old, and ought to have been in the prime of
strength, but he had worn himself out too fast.”
For solid, unadorned self-conceit it would
be hard to beat the British war-scribe who expects
people to take his own word for it that he and his
companion deliberately placed themselves under
fire to do their writing, in order to encourage the
Greek troops with whom they were. The story
would have come a lot more convincingly from
somebody else; and, even if it’s true, there’s no
heroism in mere gratuitous foolishness.

Romance of Life.
The story of Enoch Arden is a very common out
Husbands are continually turning up at incon veniea*
times, when they ought, as they are supposed u®
be, in another sphere. The whole history of loa»
heirs and defunct claimants shows that people who
are supposed to be dead and buried unexpectedly
appear upon the scene. But when a man has oetn
attended by doctors and subjected to every treat-
ment, and has been told that his case is hopeless
coming from such sources, it is generally accepted
as the inevitable.
However, experience proves conclusively tru.-,
many have been saved from the grave, d<snh»
such gloomy prognosis. Robert Wilson, Master
Schooner Saucy Jane, writing from New Heb -ine b
says: “About eighteen months ago I had oct isios
to visit Sydney, and while there was taken ill. I
went to the best doctors, but they could do nooning
for me, and I rapidly got worse and worse. I
then came on to New Caledonia and went into tint
hospital there. My spleen and liver were swelled
to an enormous size, and the pains in and unde*
my shoulders were unbearable : it being an* im-
possibility to lay down, I was obliged to sit up all
the time. After three months’ treatment I decided
to return to the islands and give Warner’s ‘ Safe '
Cure a trial, as I would sooner die than keep o»
suffering the way I was. After using seven
bottles of ‘ Safe ’ Cure and two phials of pills ttk«
pains left me, and I continued using the medicine
with the result that to-day I have not a pain or
ache in me. I thank the day that I used Warners
‘ Safe ’ Cure ; without it, I should certainly have
been in my grave long ago. It. is well worth it*

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Q. Government consists of five lawyers
and three nominees.
Opinion of a visitor : “ Victoria is governed
chiefly by Presbyterians and policemen.”
Australian loyalty is as profound as Prin-
cess May’s attachment to the Duke of Cla ’ence.
Knighthood is like marriage and rat-traps.
Those who are out want to get in, and those who
are in want to get out.
The speech of one of the Q. Labor-mem-
bers on the female Japanese was so “ blue ” that
a moral Hansard baulked.
Northerners begin to wonder which side of
the fence John Plumper Foolin’ is on. So many
true words are said in joke.
The policy of Q. Lands Dept, hitherto has
been, apparently, to cut up all the inferior lands
into small areas and to lease or sell all the good
lands in large areas.
Said that Benjamin Hoare, of the Age, will
be run by boss Syme against little Dr. Maloney,
for West Melbourne, at the coming general elec-
tions. Both are R.C.
The very transparent attempts of the Q.
Govt, whip to indicate that labor-leader Glassey is
especially obnoxious to Tozerites are arousing, not
lulling, Labor-party suspicion.
Had the order of precedence in the Jubilee
procession of colonial Pretniers, in London, been
according to the numerical population of piebalds
and skewbalds, Queensland would have been easily
first.
“In N.S.W. Assembly,” says a member,
“ the underlying feeling is right against Federa-
tion, as nine-tenths of the members feel that,
under Federation, they would sink into insig-
nificance.” “ Let us reign in Hell ! ”
The amount of lobbying done over the
Sydney city railway business was so suggestive as
to be disgraceful. Nor did the whispering all
come from the property-owners concerned : a lot
of it came from members of the Public Works
Committee itself ! JStink 1
“SOMETIMES A LIGHT SURPRISES.”
Dr. Watts-his-Name.
THE DRUNK : “ Shay, old sport, thought you, said
you — hi c— weren’t going to have any Jubilee
’lluminations? ”
During May 1251 people left Victoria for
Westralia and 1253 arrived in Victoria from the
Western province. This looks like the first sign
of the turning of the tide. Hitherto the surplus
has been always going westward, but apparently
the West is full for the time being.
Q. Govt, has despatched hired liars to Eng-
land, Ireland, Europe and America to try and
induce people to swarm to the Northern Mottle-
land to “ settle upon (or under) the soil ” while it
actually has £250,000 in hand as the paid fees of
applicants for land who can’t get land.
Rad. : “ Not a word about Princess Louise
of Wales and the Duke of Fife. Here is a prime
mischief of regal government, the gunpowder
material of conspiracies, lying about. A year or
two ago Labouchere pointed out how close this
Princess Louise might be to the throne. Surely,
in the mere course of human nature, the Duke of
York’s children must be irritants to her.”
The vagaries of Queensland politics have
brought Labor-inember Macdonald into line with
J. V. Chataway, one of the Tozeraith supporters
in the Assembly, on the question of sugar-bounties
to enable sugar-growers successfully to oppose the
“ unfair competition of beet-sugar-bounty coun-
tries. ”
There are certain islands (Lady ELiott,
Bunker Group) off the Q. coast covered with rich
deposits of guano. The Q. Govt., with its cus-
tomary recklessness, has sold the right of removing
aforesaid manure to a British syndicate for .£BO
per annum. And just within hail of Lady Elliot
Island are impoverished sugar-plantations starved
for want of this very material.
In March, 1897, the total population of
Thursday Island was 1344. Europeans numbered
571; Malays and Manilla men, 150 ; Chinese, 73 ;
aborigines, S. Sea Islanders, and mixed races,
213 ; and Japanese, 331! Aliens, 773 to 571 Euro-
peans. By the way, Thursday Island is called the
Gibraltar of Australia. Is it because, like that
famous rock fortress, it bids fair to be the posses-
sion of a power alien to its rightful owners ?
GOT WORK AT LAST.
1ST : “ My ole man never worked in his life.”
2ND: “ Well, you needn't skite. Your ole man
wouldn't be workin’ if ’e ad’n’t er jobbed my
ole woman !”
“ Owdodo ” to The Bulletin
You state that Parliament has no authority at this
stage either to accept or reject the Convention Bill, and
that members’ opinions on Federation are as useless and
irrelevant just now as their opinions about the lost grave
of Moses. It is, however, just because P. has no authority
either to accept or reject the Bill that it becomes neces-
sary for those who see in it a dangerous invasion of the
rights of the people to pound unceasingly at it. The
objective is entirely different from that of a debate on
an ordinary Bill which, in theory at least, is conducted
with a view to influencing votes. In the present discus-
sion the objective is the information of the people who,
seized with a vague sentiment in favor of Federation,
may unthinkingly disregard details. The conspiracy of
silence on the part of the dailies renders still more neces-
sary the individual utterance of members’ opinions. Nor
cari it be fairly stated that the scholarly though, perhaps,
too didactic speech of Piddington, the spirited and bril-
liant utterance of Hughes, and the passionless logical
eloquence of Ashton, are so much wasted jaw and per-
functory howl.
“Nevermind” Nelson : “The mission of
Queensland is to form part, of one of the pillars
which support the Empire.” More whisky, please,
while the bibber rises to state that the mission of
Queensland, at present helped along by Nelson,
is to carry Bull, “the Old Man of the Sea,’ on its
shoulders, and its own piccaninny, the Slave
Trade, under one arm, with the Chow and the
Jap. fastened, cat-like, on to its hip. The other
arm is mercifully left free to enable Mongrelia
to wipe the £7O-per-head debt-drops of per-
spiration off its brow, and to indicate
when its throat is getting too near to
being strangled.
illuminative of the ways of the
upright importer. In Yankeeland a
reaper and binder can be bought for
£lB. There is no Customs duty on
agricultural machinery in Queens-
land ; yet, in that province, the
£lB article cannot be bought by
farmers for less than from £55
to £C>5. Authority for these
statements ; Thynne, Q. Min-
ister for Agriculture. Where
does the odd £43 profit
(roughly) go? In Protec-
tionist Victoria the prices
are the same as in Q. It
is alleged by Freetraders
that the consumer pays
the duty, but apparently
he even pays the duty
when there isn’t any
duty.
Young Rupert
Clarke’s speech on be-
ing pitched into Vic.
Leg. Council Chamber
by a doting constituency
is a precious effort, and
should be printed large, glazed,
and framed, and hanged in that
high hall. A small, but elegant, specimen:—
This is the proudest moment of my life. It is a great
compliment to me as one of the youngest men elected to
the 1 pp r House, not on account of my own qualifications
for ti e position, but merely because of my father’s good
actions.
Why was S’rupert allowed to give the show
away in this bold and banal manner? Doesn’t
everybody know that he has inherited the title
and most of the cash, and were not these his
father’s “ qualifications ” ?
Apparently fearful lest the “God-fearing
Ministry ” should, by its anti-gambling and
Scotch - Sunday posturings, monopolise clerical
support, N.S.W. Opposition leader Lyne gives
notice of a resolution that God shall be recognised
in the preamble to the Constitution Bill.
Argus wails about the weakness of the
Opposition in the Vic. Assembly. Practically the
Argus is the Vic. Opposition and is snivelling
over its own ineptitude. The Leg. Council is the
real Vic. Opposition, though, behind which Fat-
man hugs his privileges in peace. Whilst the
Council remains, a feeble Conservative Opposition
in the Assembly counts for little either way.
Premier Braddon is reported as proudly
stating in England that “ Tasmania will soon be
able to reduce its land and income taxes and to
remit the duties on certain products.” Tasmania
has had eight deficits in the last twelve years, and,
in proportion to its revenue, has the biggest accu-
mulated shortage in the seven provinces to wipe
out, so if the Braddon Government is found
reducing anything at any time within the next
ten years it should get three months’ hard labor
for dishonesty.
In Kingston’s absence the S.A. Parlia-
ment has begun its sittings amid violent storms.
The direct Opposition led by Downer has been
reasonably quiet, but Grainger, who is practically
a free lance, has been hurling wild charges of
fraud at Acting-Premier Holder, and only retract-
ing under extreme pressure. Some Ministerialists,
on the other hand, charge Grainger and Solomon
with “conspiracy,” and Kingston’s presence with
the famous gun that he was going to fire at
Chaffey Baker is much needed to keep order
The Braddon Ministry will have put in
years of office this month, and things are so calm
in Tasmania now that it should have a fair to
break Fysh’s record of 5 years and 41 months. The
other Tas. Premiers with a longer record than Brad-
don’s are Francis Smith years), James Whyte
(3 years, 10 months), James Wilson years), and
Giblin (four years, 10 months). Barring Queens-
land and Westralia, Tasmania’s Ministries, on an
average, are the longe t-lived in Australia, Wes-
ton, who lasted only 17 days, being almost the
only Tas. Premier who was cut off suddenly in his
political youth.
Not long ago, Q. “Lands” Foxton told
the Rockhamptonians that the sale of the Corowa
and Katandra lands in the Central division was
made for the purpose of effecting settlement in
small holdings. How ? The Govt, resumed
114,000 acres, and. immediately let the owner of an
adjoining block buy —(1) 10,000 acres ; (2) 22,000
acres; and (3) 19,000 acres. Small holdings!
And now Foxton has confessed to Q. Assembly
that the land was sold to rake in revenue, much to
his personal regret. “ I had to give up my most
cherished convictions,” says he. What’s the lump
in his cheek? His tongue ? Yea, verily !
Queensland Minister Dickson, neatly
balanced on a rail :
Whilst not on the one hand a Protectionist, nor on the
other a Freetrader, yet I believe in such a readjustment
of the tariff which, while not unduly increasing the
burdens upon the people, will produce such an increment
to the exchequer as will result in an equilibrium between
the public revenue and expenditure.
And the audience, deeply impressed by the im-
posing words “readjustment,” and “ increment,”
and “ exchequer,” and “equilibrium,’ let-it pass.
If Dickson had added that he firmly believed in
the interna ionalisation of pelargoniums in Meso-
potamia without creating any unexpected ther-
mometer in Ramoth-Gilead, lie would have been
even more impressive and just as definite.
THE HEW INFANT.
AUNTIE: “Did he hurt his little self, then? Let
auntie kiss the place and make it well.”
INFANT: “ Auntie, having regard for my dignity,
and the precise locality of the injury sus-
tained, the remedy you arc good enough to
suggest becomes an absolute impossibility."
EX.
AT THE PICTURE SHOW.
“And these are works of art!”
“Some of them others are works of imagination !”
The Imperial ennobblement of Cuthbert,
M.L.C., Vic., is as great a political mystery aa
was the “elevation” of MTntyre. Both are so
palpably gone in their democratic knees as to
render the hobbles a wasteful and ridiculous
excess, and, as Conservative powers, they are
mere ear wigs.
Brisbane (Q.) Observer was surprised that
Acting-Premier Tozer accepted a title, because he
“ has become associated in our minds with men
like Mr. Gladstone—or Mr. Glassey.” Satirical?
Not a bit. The Observer merely hedged with
Glassey, according to office tradition, and then
proceeded to butter the Tozer bread seriously.
Vic. Commissioner Mathieson flatly denies
the charge of employing an undue proportion of
bov-labor on the railways. The percentage of
apprentices to mechanics, he says, was 21 per
cent, in '94 and is now only 1 per cent., and even
with the proposed increases he claims that the
Vic. lines will have the smallest percentage of
boy-labor in Australia.
Vic. M’s.P. are hurt because the Turner
Govt, has put its boot down upon the free-pass
abuse in the matter of deadhead dockets handed
out to politicians’ relatives at the opening of
Parliament. Previously, these passes have enabled
the sisters, and the cousins, and the aunts of
members, also their brothers-in-law, and their boss
supporter, and his brothers-in-law, and the corner
publican, and Totty, the barmaid, to use the rail-
ways as their own for an indefinite period, and
rush around, first class, without limit or reason.
Now the member gets a ticket for two, his wife
and his mother probably, and they can only use
this for one return journey, so many M’s.L.A.
are choke-full of disgust, and want to know if
they are still living in a free country.
A recent Sydney death notice regarding a
late lamented Chinaman ended with the words:
“ Deeply regretted by his two daughters, aged 54.”
The grief which makes any lady advertise her age
in this reckless fashion must be indeed profound.

Dr. Gore Gillon, respondent in the recent
well-advertised and abortive Sydney matrimonial
case’ has now the pleasure of footing an enormous
bill for costs on joint account. Note this, ye
woman-shriekers at the injustice of that Monster,
Man ! Here, you see, a woman can drag her hus-
band into court, overhaul his character and her
own with much public scandal, and escape
pecuniarily scot-free from the whole proceeding by
charging the bill to him, with the approval of a
man-made law !
The name of Walter Bradley has its histori-
cal associations in Sydney ; and the man who now
answers to that name is a prominent Sydney
figure to-day as he stands upon his rostrum with
his hammer uplifted and his top-hat tilted some-
what on the back of his head. Walter Bradley,
senior (he died in ’93), was a progressive citizen ;
he was one of the chief founders of the N.S.W.
Royal Agri. Soc., and he founded the Zoological
Soo. all on his own. He whacked his hammer on
the works of art and general effeots of Henry Mort
when that first of Australian fathers was “leaving
for England by the Duncan Dunbar.” He auc-
tioneered Robert Lowe’s effects; Sir John Robert-
son’s effects ; Sir Edward Strickland’s and the
Hon. Thos. Cadell’s. He also watched a certain
beloved politician drink two bottles of whisky in
one afternoon. Bradley, father and son, auction-
eered the biggest art collections ever sold in Syd-
ney—viz., the Wallace and the Douglas collec-
tions. The firm also conducted the big sale for
the late Hon. Jas. White; while yesterday
it disposed of the late George Hill’s effects
WALTER BRADLEY, a well-known Sydney
man,
Photo., Kerry.
#—the biggest sale for a long time in Sydney.
The firm used to do its business in the building
where S.M. Herald machinery now groans under
the weight of the leaders ; and, at present, Walter
Bradley and Co. hang out in a thorough old
Sydney landmark—premises occupied by the
N.S.W. bank in the days when a garden grew in
front of the bank counter, and the barracks stood
over the way, and the bullock teams lugged and
swore for miles along old Parramatta Road, and
the local aristocracy also swore, and called each
other Jack and Jim, and filled each other up with
rum, and shot ducks down Hay-street, and went to
the races in carriages drawn by dogs, and fought out
there and got run in. These things ended when the
name of Bradley was painted on the doorway,
and the hat of Bradley was tilted on the head.
The present Walter Bradley is a straight-out Aus-
tralian, an old King’s School boy—good shot, good
cricketer, good all-round sportsman. Also, he is
a top man in his line of business, and intends
shortly to get top some more by stepping into
Parliament in the right way. He did a twelve-
months’ trip to Europe in ’94, and came back a
stauncher Protectionist than ever ; and since then
it has been his ambition to help stop this country
from being eaten up by the Foreign-trade party.
Even if there is but an oft’ chance of any
scientific gain from an examination of Butler’s
brain, there is absolutely no reason why that
chance shouldn’t be grasped at. At all events, the
affectation of any sentimental consideration for
a small portion of Butler defunct is sheer impudent
hypocrisy on the part of a community that doesn’t
value Butler, alive and complete, any more than
to strangle him in cold blood !
A Melbourne man was tried for bigamy
the other day. He had married a barmaid, or
the barmaid had married him, at a local matri-
monial agency, when he was too drunk to remem-
ber that he had one wife at home already. Case
dismissed. The officiating person was a duly-
qualified parson, too. “Do you take this woman
to be your wedded wife ? ” “ Yesh (hie!), I’ll
take either of ’em.”
Part of a Melbourne unemployed deputa-
tion the other day went so far as to shake his fist
at Acting-Premier Isaacs, and threatened to stoush
that eminent man in his own office. The visible
embodiment of the law was called in, but the
deputationist lay down in Isaacs’ office, and had
to be trailed along the carpet to get him out.
Apparently an Acting-Premier doesn’t inspire so
much respect as the real live-meat article.
Thus an exchange:—
Had his age permitted it, one of the most appropriate
spectators at the unveiling of Gov. Phillip’s statue in
Sydney would have been Mr. Thomas John, senr., of Com-
leroy Road. Mr. John is the son of one of Gov. Phillip’s
soldiers, who came out in the first fleet.
But there is some error here. No soldiers came
out in the first fleet.
Fitzgibbon, the sewer-bard of Melbourne,
did address a jubilee ode to Queen Victoria, after
all. The ode came out at the last moment, and
although it was but a small ode ’it was sufficiently
blatant, every verse beginning with a frenzied
“ hail 1 ” as per sample :
Hail to the Queen 1 Holy and homely,
Perfect in life,
Daughter and wife,
Mother and widow, loving and comely.
“Flat-iron” sends to The Bulletin this
incredible-looking story:—
Recently a youth was charged, at Wangaratta (Vic.)
court, with stealing 2s. 6d. from his employer. The
latter, a wealthy landowner, had engaged him to clear
and burn the timber off 200 acres of forest land at the
munificent rate of threepence per acre, and keep himself
in food, &c. £2 10s for a winter’s job—ye gods ! Do
you protect the sweater? Let Chief-Sec. Peacock make
the landowner a factory and fix a living-wage, and he will
have done something towards providing old-age pensions.
For midwinter rains the showers which
have lately fallen out back have been among the
best on record. Cold rains would inevitably have
killed more of the famishing sheep than the actual
drought has done ; but in the midst of a very cold
winter these rains, though not heavy enough in
most far-back parts to fill the tanks, came in
gently and with a delightfully mild change, under
which scrub revived and grass sprang “ like
magic.”
The evangelic howl of “ Where was Nan-
sen’s God?”--like the local shriek about the
Deity’s “omission” from the Federal Constitu-
tion—is based upon stubborn blindness to the fact
that it is never the praetically-religious man who
is continually turning God over in his mouth. If
Nansen believes in God, he probably believes also
that God doesn’t need reassurance on the point at
every second page ; if he doesn’t believe in God,
he wouldn’t be any the less an atheist for being
more of a hypocrite.
The London Dental Institute, of 98 King-
street, Sydney (now in charge of Dr. S. Lever, a
doubly-qualified dentist, and Mr. S. D. Asher,
both favorably known in the dental world), draws
attention to the fact that another operating room
has been added to the establishment. The new
department is reserved for conservative work in
general—-such as treatment of teeth, gold fillings,
pivot teeth, gold caps and gold and porcelain
crown and bridge work. All this is done at
reform fees, so as to bring such work within the
reach of all who may be desirous of saving their
teeth, instead of losing them. There is no amateur
work turned out of this establishment, whether
artificial teeth on plates, bridgework, or fillings.
Dental science has now reached such a stage that
all dentists should be able to guarantee a perfect
fit as far as artificial teeth a,re concerned, and no
toothache after filling has been inserted. Such,
at any rate, is the practice of the London Dental
Institute.
“But for this being Jubilee week we
should fine you -610,” was the remark made by
O’Connor, J.P., of Richmond (Vic.), to a man
who had used undressed language in the streets
and savagely battered a constable. It being
Jubilee week the prisoner got off with £3. It is
difficult to follow the ideas of tfie typical J.P.,
but he seems to hold that people should not object
so much to awful language at a Jubilee as at
other times —in other words, that it is more appro-
priate then’ than Usual. Also, that a policeman
should be kicked in the eye more freely and at
less cost when his Queen has reigned 60 years than
on ordinary occasions. Another individual who
let off fireworks in the crowd, and nearly blew up
sundry loyal citizens, was released upon the strong
protests of one J.P., who thought he should be
let off by reason of the Jubilee ; and in the case
of an individual who banged a cabman’s horse on
the head with a big stick, the Bench took the
trouble to explain at great length that even the
Jubilee couldn’t fully justify his conduct. If the
news gets about that man may batter and blow up
his fellowman, and maul his neighbor’s horse with
a club almost gratis at Jubilee times, there will
arise a general demand that future monarchs
should die young.

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three tunes a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY

Baron Berzilius’——
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
These Bitters I recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chromo
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of (lie Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
Elant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
iseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable ami wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen: —
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows:
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hopo others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to al
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when sufiering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The great anti-betting crusade in N.S.W. ia
apparently flickering out. At the beginning the fine on
a first conviction was £lO, but when a recent batch of
cases came on the highest fim- for a third conviction was
£lO, and some first offenders were let off as low as 40s.
Also, though many bookies who were heavily fined haven’t
paid, nothing dreadful has happened. The tote and
“ double ” shops, meanwhile, are doing business as openly
as ever and quite unmolested.
* • * #
Aurum’s record weight—for a three-year-old—of
Bst. 61b. in the Melb. and Caulfield Cups, shows the handi-
cappers to be agreed as to the moderate quality of the
older horses engaged. A thumping weight for Aurum
was inevitable. In describing ihe probabilities of the’9s
Melb. Cup, The Bulletin argued that a good three-year-
old would whack the veterans, and that Auraria justified
the argument by beating Hova. Last year, with Hova
and the crack youngsters of ’95 all laid on the shelf,
The Bulletin again predicted that Melb. Cup would
fall to a three-year-old, and Newhaven, after winning
his Derby in a canter, “ walked home ” for
the big handicap. Now Newhaven has left the
country, and the only notable representative of classio
form included in the Cup entries is Wallace, whose racing
career was probably ended when he broke down last
Spring. The all-round quality of the older horses appears
so very moderate that Aurum, as the boss youngster of
his season, is weighted 71b. higher than the burden which
Newhaven made light of last year, not because thehandi-
capper reckons Aurum a half-stone better three-year-old
than the phenomenal chestnut, but because the p.c. won
his Melb. Cup with more than that amount in hand.
Merry Boy, on the bare fact that he won the
V.R.C. Handicap (carrying 7st. 121 b.) last Nov., looks
lightly handicapped for the Melb. Cup at Bst. 41b. At
any rate, the nuggety, common-looking horse should hold
O’Trigger safe, presuming that he didn’t suffer a serious
injury through his mishap in Sydney. In the case of
Bravo, years ago, a victory in the V.R.C. Handicap fore-
shadowed a Melb. Cup win, and The Merry Boy, with a
few pounds less than Bravo’s weight, will not have such
sterling animals as Carbine and Melos against him. Time
enough, however, to think about the “ Boy” after he has
been seen again in public.
* * * *
The Bulletin’s attempt to guess the winner of
the G.N. Hurdle Race, at Fleinington, proved a ghastly,
failure. Ten horses were mentioned as likely ones ; only
four of them started in a field of 18, one of those four fell
and broke his neck, and neither of the other three got
placed. Tipsters in general, and punters at large, re-
peated their last year's miscalculations. Buzzi won for
the second time, at an outside price, followed by Castillo
(25 to 1), Deposed (40 to 1), and Conventioner(2s to 1). A
cruel satire upon the intelligence of the betting-market.
The popular mistake this year was in backing
young and unseasoned jumpers to give a lot of weight to
a horse that had already proved himself a stayer. Half-a-
mile from home, Soult and So-and-So had command of
the situation, but, at the end of the 3-mile journey, they
dropped away, outpaced by three light-weights. Had
the going been at all heavy, the defeat of the favorites
would have been more decisive. Buzzi last year won a
muddy race with several pounds to spare.
Handicapper Dakin appears to have reck-
oned that Buzzi’s first win was more or less of a
fluke — i.e., a result aided by exceptional circumstances—
and the public followed the handicapner’s opinion. In
the light of last Saturday’s surprise Buzzi must be set
down as a good horse, specially dedicated to Grand
National hurdle-races. His victory in 1896 came after a
sequence of eight defeats over shorter courses. Then he
was laid aside for many months with a view to annexing
the same event a second time, and the handicapper gave
him a great chance to do the trick by letting him in once
again among the under-ten-stoners. Buzzi’s owner is a
lucky man.
For the G.N. Steeplechase next Saturday, it
goes without saying that Zouroff has an apparently great
chance. He proved his speed and staying power last year
by running second to Buzzi over the hurdles, and if he
can get over the bigger jumps without an accident,
Zouroff, with list. 31b. to carry, must be better worth
backing than most of them. The Bulletin will venture
another tip—Zouroff in preference to Romsdal, Walter,
Nipper and Hayseed.
When Buzzi was making his effort last Satur-
day, an excited sportsman roared persistently from the
upper grand stand : “Stick to him, Alf. 1” The nearer
the horse got to the winning-post the louder and faster
roared the voice from afar off “ Stick to him, Alf. ! ” It
was Mark Whitty talking to his boy, Alfred, on Buzzi’s
back, and forgetting in his excitement that he was wast-
ing words. But, anyway, he had the satisfaction of seeing
Alf. stick like a postage-stamp.
• • * *
Though unlucky with So-and-So, last Saturday,
the Ballarat stables are sure to have an innings shortly,
as not only have they a good chance of winning G.N.
Steeple with Walter, but Dreamland and Wait-a-Bit are
promising Caulfield and Melb. Cup candidates.

Owing to internal dissensions amongst the S.A.

Duddingston was a great public favorite
throughout last week for Canterbury Park Handicap,
N.S.W., but he was scratched, and the stable tried to win
with Wingello, who only ran second. Such tactics are so
common in Sydney that the disappointed backer does not
even raise a groan when the horse returns to weigh. In
England, the other day, Calvert's Clwyd, a winner under
similar circumstances, had to be escorted back by a guard
of prize-fighters, amidst the groans and execrations of a
furious mob.

N.S.W. cast-off Response (Richmond —Bis Bis)
easily won V.R.C. Maiden Hurdles last Sat., and, as
jumping practice will likely instil confidence into this
brilliant though shifty mare, her chance for Caulfield

. Re horse nomenclature, merely mixing up the
names of sire and dam, and taking half of each, doesn’t
necessarily make a suitable name. Originality is required.

Carbina (Carbine—Azalea), winner of the Y.R.C.
Two Year Old Handicap last Saturday, is in the same
stable as the Flying Key whose meeting with 'Aurum in
any race is anticipated with great interest. Rumour hath
it that there is a “ darkey ” in the same stable better than
either of the pair. If this is so the Derby won’t, after all,
be an exercise canter for Aurum.

One Griffiths has put up a club-swinging record
at Newcastle (N.S.W.) with 36 hours and 220 combina-
tions. How can such a dreary exhibition be classed as
sport ? Yet we are told that a committee of idiots
attended all the time to feed him by means of an invalid
cup with beef-tea, port, &c. It’s as sickening as that other
record —Queen Victoria’s salary-drawing.
* * * *
Some 25,000 people rushed early to Sydney
Cricket Ground to howl and yell while 2£ tons of live
human meat mortified itself by assault and battery.
The 30 players all wore numbers upon their
bodies. As the Maorilanders came out they looked, in
their black jerseys, a harder and more square-shouldered
set than the N.S.W. light blues. And they are. All but
three or four of them are horny-handed—laborers, farmers,
bricklayers, carpenters, &c. Such are the footballers cul-
tivated in M.L.; when they get seriously to business, they
simply knock chips off their opponents. They played the
roughest game seen on Sydney Cricket Ground for many
a day ; they crippled a big man like Abbott so badly that
he had to be carried off the field ; they opened veteran
Warbrick’s scalp, and played the very devil with N.S.W.
shins in the scrum. And they cowed and smothered one
or two elegant N.S.W. civil servants, who had been put
into the home team by mistake.
Though they had never played as a combination
before, and had only been off the steamer a couple of
days, the Maorilanders pressed the play back into the
N.S.W. twenty-five the whole time, and when they were
not close to the N.S.W. line they were closer, and the
only time they ceased the offensive was when they
stopped altogether for the ambulance brigade to rush
upon the scene with splints and bandages, and to patch
up somebody who was more or less dead. They played
with more knowledge, more coolness, more pluck, and
more unselfishness than did the N.S.W. team, and the
only reason why they shouldn’t deal it out still hotter to
N.S.W. in the return match is that they are inclined to
eat too much, and to generally live too well. The only
possible things to beat M.L. next Saturday are the hotel
table and the little perfumed handkerchief.
This season’s football in M.L. has been re-
markable for evenness of form. No man of the present
visitors is distinct for individual brilliancy. Some of the
visitors, however, claim that Orchard, their back, is not
only the best back in M.L., but the best ever seen there.
He didn’t play up to his reputation last Saturday, other-
wise his team would have won by 13—5 instead of 13—8.
The most experienced man of the Maorilanders is Bailey
(the captain), a farmer, and one of the two or three
married men of his side. He has been playing first-class
football over 10 years, and was vice-captain with the ’93
M. team in N.S.W. Also, he is the oldest man of his
side —over 30 ; the youngest is Brooker (19 years), who
played so well as a junior last season that he finds him-
self picked for the representative tour. The rest of the
side average about five years at first-class football.
The M.L. side that played last Saturday could
■only have been improved by substituting Mills for Hard-
castle. Yet Hardcastle’s play was Al, he shone more
than any N.S.W. man did. Note his splendid run through
N. and his unselfish passing of the ball at the last
moment to Allen, who couldn’t help getting the try. Take
them as a side, the Maorilanders fed one another hand-
somely. Several of the Sydney players are stupidly selfish.
The only Maori in M.L. v. N.S.W. was veteran
“ Billy ” Warbrick, who played with N.S.W. No Maori
in M.L. just now is considered good enough by the M.L.
selectors. They say, indeed, that the Maoris of the
Hawke’s Bay Union team are the only ones that reach
■even first-class club form this season. And the Hawke’s
Bay district is notably rich in Maoris.
The M.L. team comprises 14 North Islanders
■and onlj' 6 South. The South is very sore about it. The
match North v. South, just before leaving for N.S.W.,
was consequently very willing. Millsand Armit had their
shoulders seriously hurt. Taranaki, top province for two
years, has 5 representatives and Wellington 4.
To sum up, the chief points of the Maoriland-
N.S Wales football-match were : brutally rough play in
the first half by Maoriland, and ditto by both teams in
the second ; unselfish play on the part of the Maoris; and
selfish play by N.S.W. M.L. started a rough game, played
a deal of offside, and kicked freely in the scrums. Their
unselfish play and combination no doubt won the match
for them, as they scored a couple of very soft tries owing
to want of combination by N.S.W. Abbott’s uniform
selfishness had one bright exception—when he fed Wick-
ham, the result being a score.
* * • *
The football craze : Abbott leaves his solicitor’s
business, in Wyalong, to come to Sydney to get laid out
by the M.L. sons of toil. Football and the lawyer’s pro-
fession can never work together.

Mick Dooley should have a very soft thing with

Think of the number of men who would have
■done comfortably in life but for their sporting bias.
■C. T. B. Turner, “ the Terror,” says “ cricket loses a man
his chance in life.” Here and there a successful athlete
acts sensibly. A. G. Steel, who one season was best bat,
best bowler, best fieldsman in England, slung the whole
baby-show when he started his law-business. How often
his case used to be cited by Percy M‘Donnell! No man
ever spoke more bitterly about the cricketer s bubble re-
putation than did M’Donnell. H. Moses, by the way, is
one Australian who stuck hard down to business and
would have none of the trip to England.
* * * *
Cycle road-racing seems a trifle worse than
steeplechasing. The Vic. season just starting and already
two fatal falls. Young Robinson’s death last Saturday
was through exceptional hard luck—he was on level road
with nobody near him when the crown of his machine
cracked and threw him head-first on the metal. Against
a faulty machine the best rider is powerless to contend.
In cycling, so much depends on the way a race
is ridden that 20 men of equal merit might he started in
20 different races and a different competitor win every
time. The man who gets home under all conditions is
the real champion, and that is the sort Bilmartin was at
the end of last year, and the sort Bananalander Walne is
to-day. In the big race of the Melb. Jubilee meeting, the
spectators quite forgot it was a handicap to see cracks
like Walne, Body and Relph battling home for places, and
in that final run of his the form proved once more that he
is unquestionably the best Australian who ever crossed a
wheel.
Where has the much-advertised Parsons in any
way approached the record of Walne, about whom there
is little fuss ? Parsons now and again rode brilliant races,
hut not his most ardent worshipper can accuse him of
being constantly good. Yet day after day, week in and
week out, Walne beats the cracks of Australia repeatedly,
and those outside swoops of his at the finish are really as
brilliant as the best of Parsons’ work.
Walne rode a bicycle for the first time in May,
1896, and started to race four months later — i.e., he has
not yet completed his first year’s racing, and yet he has
over £7OO to his credit in prize-money alone. Where is
there a first year’s rider with a better record ?

A Canadian visitor who witnessed a lacrosse
match in Adelaide, recently, between the two leading
teams, N. Adelaide and University, described the game as
being equal to anything he had seen in Canada or Eng-
land. The S.A. team which played Victoria last Saturday
(3rd) was, with the exception of two players, the strongest
S.A. could place in the field. The game has become im-
mensely popular in Adelaide, and has completely under-
mined football.
• » * *
Lacrosse needs even more endurance than foot-
ball, as there is none of the delay which accompanies that
game, the ball never being out of bounds. The S.A. team
which played in Melbourne consisted almost entirely of
noted runners, particularly Fotheringham, R >sman,
Drew, and Downer. Much skill is also required, but the
great drawback in the game is that the spectators cannot
see the little rubber bail which is used, and the excite-
ment is not wrought up to the extent that it is with two
evenly-matched football teams. This is the chief reason
why lacrosse will probably never supplant football as a
gate-money game.

started his Sydney cycle business in ’B3, and has done an
ever-increasing trade ever since. Being progressive, he
went to England a very short time back, and secured all
the best of latest appliances for building bicycles. At the
Electric and Engineering Exhibition, now running in
Sydney, Phizackerley has a fine show in the bicycle-
building business. He sends his trustworthy wheels
straight from the Sydney depot, Druitt-st., to any part of
N.S.W.*

Legal question whisperingly discussed just
now in a certain province : Is it bribery or em-

to transfer his printing work to the office of a
juryman in a successfully-defended libel-action,
immediately after the case is finished ?
Miss Flora Shaw's meddling and muddling
in Transvaal affairs is not encouraging to those who
claim for women a larger share of political power.
By the way, in his novel skit on the South African
trouble, published some months ago, St. Stead
makes Rhodes, thinly veiled under another name,
and a woman journalist play principal parts. His
Holy Nastiness once again had obtained a peep
behind the scenes.
The saddest spectacle on Jubilee night, in
Melbourne, was a “push ” of young men, 400 or
500 strong perhaps, charging through the dense
crowd, bearing a soldier on their shoulders. The
man aloft was a glittering hero who brandished
his helmet and whooped, whilst the trotting fools
below howled like fiends, and gesticulated in a
frenzy of what may have been “ loyalty,” or mere,
unreasoning excitement, but was certainly not
beer. The writer saw nothing in the whole
Jubilee idiocy so disgusting as this apotheosis of
Tommy Atkins by youths who couldn't plead
liquor as an excuse.
The Eye-sight measure per post by the in
ventors, Messrs. Greenfield and Barraclough. the
well-known opticians of George-st., Sydney, enables
eye-sufferers in the country to ascertain the data
necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection—
long sight, short sight, old sight. Full particulars

It is urged that because the N.S.W. rail-
ways, thanks to the late Mr. Eddy, are now in a
comparatively efficient condition, there is no need
to engage a railway-man of wide managerial and
up-to-date experience in succession to the dead
commissioner. In a word, it is proposed that one
of the two remaining commissioners shall take
Mr. Eddy’s place. Only one of the present com-
missioners is a railway-man at all. The late chief
did, as it were, all the actual shaving; his col-
leagues merely lathered, but, being only human,
they now reach out for the razor.

Cheerful lie from a Northern Ananias.
“I was feeding up a cow for the local show. She
was the fattest beast I ever saw, but the ticks
killed her. She died near the head of a gully, and
the fat melted and ran down the gully nearly a
quarter of a mile.”
In New York lately people thought that an
elegant Jack the Ripper had settled down to work.
The victims—in every instance women of the town
who wore jewellery—were followed to their rooms,
choked to death with short pieces of rope, in
which a peculiar slipnot was tied, and were then
robbed. But a couple of ordinary murderous
burglar ruffians were caught red-handed.
Dear Bulletin, —I think I can hail, con-
ceal, and never reveal the abracadabra of Masonry,
and still let you know that I agree with you in
your remarks on “the Masonic sham.” The
brethren are never glad to see their older brothers
with Matilda up, and I once experienced the
greatest difficulty in obtaining admission to the
installation of a Provincial Grand Master, not
because I was not known to be a Master-Mason,
which I proved myself, but because I was only
decently, not funereally, dressed. The want of an
apron was then used as a bar, but I got one out of
a pawnshop in five minutes, and saw the stamped
gilt name on the case—the name of one of the'
very men (a tyler) who proved me. But I got in,
and sat among the Grand Imperial Holy Panjan-
drums, and I am only,—S. le W.
Love really is blind. He hadn’t any
friends, was sightless, and used to sun-toast him-
self all day on a bench in the park. She sat down
beside him one day and began to talk. Then she
came every day and took to leading him home to
his lodgings when the sun waned. The touch of
her hand was pleasant, her voice was gentle and
fresh, and she diffused an air of youth and sym-
pathy around her. . . . She said “ Yes ” when he
asked her. Then one day, as she was sitting
beside him as usual, it occurred to him that people
who passed giggled, even laughed outright. It
struck him that they had been doing this for days.
Irritated, he at last asked somebody the reason
while she went to buy him an orange. And when
he heard that they grinned at seeing a negress
, sitting beside a blind white man, he got up quickly
and hobbled away. She never saw him again.

Dear Sir, — I have much pleasure to inform you that a
eourse of your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, I consider you are deserving of
success, which I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-

Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus: To Heir Rassmusskn.—Dear
Sir, —I think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Dear ffir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform you that
I have derived great benefit from yon> celebrated Alfaline

in the buslv—Yours very truly, B. UTTON

Witness: A. F. kkhr, Manager, Grand Hotel, Spring-

Mr. Biht n writes later: “The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangarat ta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It attords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your 4 lfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
ease was a most serious one ; it had been oaused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.

A Wonderful Cure.

Dear Sir, —In the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised

complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l

111. For the past six years he has conducted the
cleanest and most attractive meat market in the
city. His business is done on a large scale, and is
both retail and wholesale. He is recognised as
one of the city’s most progressive business men,
being always prominent as a leader.
Mr. Stevens says that some months ago his wife,
whose health has never been of the best, began to
show signs of an early decline, which he feared
would result seriously unless something could be
done for her. She appeared to lose the greater
part of her usual interest in the affairs of the
family and household. Mr. Stevens says he had
repeatedly cautioned her about going too long
without proper medical attendance, but she would
keep putting it off until he took the matter into
his own hands and summoned the family physician
who diagnosed her complaint as chlorosis or green
sickness. She was also troubled with coldness of
the hands and feet resulting from a very im-
poverished condition of the blood. The general
debility of the system was particularly well-
marked, and the above, coupled with tardy and
irregular periods, made Mrs. Stevens a very sick
and miserable woman,
For a space of two weeks she followed strictly
the rules laid down by her physician. At times
she felt somewhat more at ease, but there was
evidence that no improvement had commenced.
The patient, who had faithfully expected im-
mediate results from the treatment, began to fall
into fits of despondency which would sometimes
last a week or more.
Mr. Stevens says that one day he picked up a
piece of paper in his store, which, on reading,
proved to be a circular about, Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People. “ I noticed the pills were
said to be used as a specific for all the ills woman
is heir to, and this set me to thinking. I figured
that they couldn’t do her much more harm than
the various decoctions and compounds the doctors
had prescribed for her, and if they did her no good
why there was no harm done, and no great amount
of money squandered. I sent my clerk out at once
to get a box of the Pink Pills, and that day at
supper time my wife commenced taking them.
“ At this time she was in a very enfeebled con-
dition and her stomach very weak. She would
sometimes be unable to retain even a glass of
water. The first few doses seemed to have a good
effect in soothing her at night. She slept better,
and felt and looked fresher in the morning than
she had for months. Her mental condition ap-
peared to receive fully as much beneft as her
physical, for she was more inclined to look at the
: brighter side of matters, instead of constantly
hunting out the dark features.
“ She kept right on taking the pills, and the
favorable symptoms became more marked. We
all felt as if she were on a very fair road to re-
covery. Time proved that she was, indeed, for I
do not believe you will find in the city a healthier
woman than my wife. She has no bad symptoms
whatever, she has gained in weight, and we all
know that she owes it to Dr. Williams Pink Pills
for Pale People.
“ Wait a moment, I’m not through yet, I want
to do as much for Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills as I
feel they have done for us,” said Mr. Stevens, as
the reporter, after thanking him for the courteous
attention shown, was about to take his leave.
Mr. Stevens said : “My wife had no more than
recovered when my son Verne began to look thin
and puny. He had plenty of good food, exercise
and in general, as healthy surroundings as most
of us, but that didn’t seem to help much. He had
fever and ague, and everything pointed to a
malarious condition of the system. The doctor
said that there was a poor assimilation, and did
all he could to help him.
“ We noticed no favorable results, and finally I
made up my mind that if Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People had increased his mother’s weight
and enriched her blood, it might do the same for
him. He began taking them, and almost from
the first day, began to feel better. He always
awoke in the morning with a foul-tasting mouth.
He remarked the second or third morning after he
began taking the pills, that this had left him, and
he felt like eating his breakfast. You never saw
anyone’s recovery so rapid as that boy’s, and he
hasn’t had any return either.
“ There is nothing visionary or that looks like
guesswork about what I have told you, we know
what the remedy is, for we have, I believe, given
it as thorough a test as it ever had.
“Yes, sir, I can truthfully say that I believe
these pills, if given a fair chance, will prove a per-
manent cure for lots of diseases that people are
suffering from.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured numerous
cases of paralysis, locomotor ataxia, spinal disease,
rheumatism, and sciatica ; also of diseases arising
from impoverished and vitiated humors of the
blood, which cause scrofula, rickets, chronic ery-
sipelas, consumption of the bowels and lungs,
ansemia, pale and sallow complexion, general
muscular weakness, loss of appetite, palpitations,
pains in the back, nervous headache, early decay,
all forms of female weakness, and hysteria. These
Pills are not a purgative. They are genuine only
with the full name, Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Palo. People, and are sold by chemists and by Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Company, Sydney, who will

! If anything can kill tight-lacing it will be
the radiograph. The Queen of Portugal, who is an
enthusiast about the new photography, has been
horrifying her court-ladies with a sight of the
effects of corseting upon their internal arrange-
ments. They begin to wonder, with Abernethy,
‘ where they’ve been stowing their livers.”
Commerce depends on two governing fac-
tors : the sale of commodities, and the receipt of
the cash (or other commodities) which they repre-
sent. In times of depression like the present, both
processes are difficult of accomplishment—esp'-
cially the latter ! But merchants who can sell
their goods need not be apprehensive o* getting
paid for them if they will hand their accounts to
the Victorian Debt - Collecting Agency (Holds-
worth & Co.), 101 Swanston-st., Melbourne.*
John M'Kenzie, the huge, blundering
Highlander whom Sedd _,n left in charge of Maori-
land affairs when he went away to jubilate,
promises to be the Nemesis of the Ministry.
M'Kenzie is a cumbersome, ill-tempered person,
who has a yearning to make speeches on all occa-
sions. Then the judicious National Ass man
prods him with irritating questions, and John
plunges about like an angry whale, and says things
that it will take Seddon all the time between now
and next general election to explain away. No
politician ever had a greater capacity than
M'Kenzie for putting both his boots in his mouth
at once, and his statements about the jobs he has
done, and his wild threats about the jobs he will
do if somebody doesn’t behave himself better,
bring joy to the bosom of the National Mule.

A rumor has arisen that there will be a
“ surplus ” from the N.S.W. railways and tram-
ways for the present financial year. It probably
only means that there will be a surplus over last
year’s earnings, not over interest and expenses,
but that is a side issue. The interesting point
is that, as soon as the word “surplus ” was men-
tioned, the Assembly rose almost as one man to
suggest ways of spending it, and the scramble
was like that of a dozen dogs on top of one bone.
The N.S.W. railways had £374,000 deficit last
year ; they have an accumulated deficit of
.£7,700,000} the Treasurer has a shortage of over
millions to pay off and is praying for any little
windfall that may come in his way to help him;
and yet as soon as one department promises to
have a small surplus, or not quite so big a deficit
as usual, there goes up a wild demand that it
should shout seed-wheat for everybody’s consti-
tuents, and generally take the whole country out
to have a drink.
Two “ Jacks ashore,” from H.M.S. Kara-
katta, were before the Cairns (N.Q.) court the
other day. One had been “dished” for
“language,” assaulting the police, and “ tear in’
me uniform,” the other was presented for “ob-
structing ” the constable “ in the execution of his
duty.” And this was his jovial patter :
Well, sir, we comes ashore an’ gets too much whisky,
an’ my mate here gets took, an’ when he gets took, bein’,
as it were, a chum o’ mine, I goes to help him. You’d
help a chum o’ yours, sir.
The court roared, and—let the pleader off. But,
when told that he might go, while his mate was
apparently to be kept until fines were met, the
briny one blurted out—“ Go ? No, not me ! I
goes along o’ my chum. If you takes him to
quod, you takes me ! ” Both tars were returned
on board a little later on. “But, sir,” said the
chumophile, “no matter what you gives us
here, we’ll get punished enough when we gets
aboard.”
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The.firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
From the “other side,” this: “Oh, the
Govt. (Q.) is all right. Ministerialists may growl,
but we know just how they’ll vote, my boy. We
know how to bring each man round. Politics is
only a matter of voting, after all. If your men
are a good lot, so much the better. If they are a
bad lot, it doesn’t matter a damn; their votes tell,
and other things happen fast enough to make
everyone forget it. There will be no change of
Ministry just yet.”

No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“MR W G. Hearne. —Dear Sir,-Your medicine has cured me of Bronchitis and
AotVnm from which I suffered for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
Xcc vever free from coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so dis-
scarcely e • sucoess i o n I had to sit up. I. write you this acknowledg-
merit 'from a sense of duty, as in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
evious I had been getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your medi-
P- T was confined to bed, suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
2nrl matter Tnd apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of the medicine
ve me welcome relief, and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment, until I
became, as lam now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.
“ Will Mr Hearne please send a bottle of his Bronchitis Cure ? I had one two or
three months ago, which effected a speedy cure.— J. WYATT, Geelong.
“Mr Hearne.-Dear Sir,-Your Bronchitis Cure has thoroughly cured my
nnmrh I never coughed since the second dose. lam truly grateful to you for it, as I
had tried so many things, but nothing ever did me any good,-Yours very truly, C.
MOORE, Little Malop Street, Geelong.” ,
« Mr w G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—Some months ago my little boy got very ill with
h-fmehitis Mv wife heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him and less than half the bottle completely cured him. We always keep
ftfn thehouse now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try it; he did so, and it was
1* Sas successful with his children. You are at liberty to make what use you like of
this as I consider your Bronchitis Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely known
in fact I cannot speak too highly of it.-Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.”
“Mv son, six years old, had Bronchitis for 12 months. The noise in throat and
alone back of lungs, and the cough, caused me great anxiety I tried several treat-
ments. Gough mixtures and poultices were used, and plasters were applied to the
back and chest without success. I bought a, large-size bottle of Hearne s Bronchitis
Cure and after my boy had taken this medicine for about 10 days he was perfectly
cured.— J. PATTERSON, Solicitor, Tamworth.”
« De ar Sir —I have much pleasure in informing you that my father has been mi-
nrrwino- ever since he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now all signs of Bron-
chitis'have'disaiipeared.—Yours respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Jun., Bloomfield, Ever-
ton, Victoria.”
“Mr W G Hearne.—Sir,—Will you kindly forward another bottle of your
Bronchitis Cure ? The bottle you sent me about three weeks ago thoroughly cured me
of the cough.—Yours truly, H. M‘BEAN, Carlton.”
“Dear Sir—l had occasion to use your Bronchitis Cure, and have been com-
pletely cured by it.-Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merleswood, Elsternwick,
Victoria.”
“ Dear Sir —Many thanks for forwarding Bronchitis Cure so quickly. It is doing
a lot of good.—Yours faithfully, M. ROSEVEAR, Malvern.”
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l had a bad attack of Bronchitis for six months,
with dreadful hacking cough day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak that I could not lea\ e my bed.
At this stage I was pronounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicine of dif-
ferent kinds, but nothing did me any good until reading in the Age of your Bronch tis
Cure I got a bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved. After taking
two bottles the cough and night sweats left me, my appetite returned, and I was able
to get up, and am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and shall reco 1
mend your Medicine to my friends.—Yours truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill,
Victoria.”

The Gold Slug .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With sundown it became chilly, and the
door was closed. A fire in the wide fireplace and
a milk-pan of dough set to rise before it; the
father, seated under the chimney, mending har-
ness by the light of the blazing logs. Two children
doing their home lessons —Frank chanting his
four-times like a refrain ; Maggie writing her
exercise at one side of the candle; on the other
sat the mother reading the newspaper, knitting
socks, and talking at intervals. After reading
the column of “Births, Deaths and Marriages '
with the unction of an epicure she gave a sigh, for
all the names were strange to her, and turned to
the less important portion of the paper. Pre-
sently she put it down with an air of decision.
“ Really, George ! You ought to go—everyone
is going. There seems to be gold all over the
country.”
“ Why are you always harping on that, Mary ?
That’s only a yarn. We have heard it all before
any time these last 20 years.”
“ But here it is in print! Don’t you believe the
paper ? Oh, if I were only a man I’d go. Why,
if we only had half, or quarter, of what others are
getting the mortgage could be paid. Now, how
do you expect to ever pay it stopping here ? ”
The wife paused, the man was silent and looked
sceptical as he continued to bore holes for his
thread.
“ And, supposing it is only part true, there
must be a fortune for everyone who has the heart
to go. Hundreds of miles of country full of
nuggets and reefs. Think of that! And. is it
likely the papers would invent all that if it was
not true ? ”
“ Always the same song, my dear. Remember,
it is not all gold that glitters. We can make a
living here—a hard one, it’s true; still:, we can live.
And, as my old dad used to say, ‘A crust at
home is better than a cake abroad.’ We hear of
the few who succeed, not of the many who fail;
and, besides, it would want all the little money
we’ve got to take me there.” :
“ Well, I declare, George, you’ve got no pluck !”
and the mother resumed her reading with an air
of disgust, but she was interrupted by Maggie.
“Do you know what, Mum ! All the children
were telling at school to-day about Alf. Austin.
He’s come back from Coolgardie with I don’t
know how much money, and he’s going to buy the
best farm in the bottoms —Johnson’s place, you
know ; and Fknery says his father and two uncles
are going, and he is going to have a horse of his
own when they get their fortune, and he’ll let me
have a ride on it.”
“Do you hear that, George?” exclaimed the
wife; triumphantly. “ What did I tell you ? If a
ne’er-do-well like that Austin can make a fortune,
why not you ? Really I’ve no patience.”
The man’s resistance was broken, his objections
fruitless and exhausted. He felt it better to face
the evils he dreaded rather than maintain this
nightly contest.
“ As you’re so set on it, Mary, and you think
you can manage here by yourselves for a spell, I’ll
go with the Emerys when the corn’s shelled.”
* » • •
Ten months passed. The children were
playing touch round the house, when Maggie
called out: “ Here comes a swagman ! ” They all
stopped in their game to stare. A man, bent in
the shoulders and dragging his feet wearily, was
coming towards the house.
“ I believe it’s Dad,” said Frank.
“ You silly! Why, it’s an old man.”
Ernie (the baby), catching the word, toddled off
along the track, singing out “ Dada ! Dada ! ” so
that the others came racing along the path and
passed him ; then, not to be outdone, he screamed
out in his piping voice : “Dada ! Beauty’s dot a
white talf with a red tail! ”
The man smiled, almost cheerfully, as the
children surrounded him, and, taking his swag,
disputed as to who should carry it to the house.
The shouting brought the wife to the door wiping
her hands from soapsuds. She gave one long,
astonished look at the man.
“ Well, Mary ! ”
“Oh, George, is that you?” There was a
choking in her voice as she kissed him on the
cheek. It was little Ernie who broke the silence :
“ Oh, Mums ! Dada’s dot flour on his head.”
“Yes, Sonny,” said the father with a grim
smile, “ I’ve got flour on my head right enough,
and what’s more, it will never brush off.”
The wife bustled about, and soon had him in a
chair. Kneeling down she took off the boots from
his tired feet.
“ Well, I hardly knew you, you look 20 years
older.”
“So I am, my dear; not 20 but a hundred.”
“We have not heard from you for four months.”
“ Been in the hospital; only left it to come
back.”
“ And the Emeries ? ”
“ Beth buried there,” and the man pointed with
his hand towards the west. “ I’m the only one of
us the fever did not kill. But I’ve got gold,” and
he took a slug the size of a bean from his pocket
and placed it on the table. “ There is what I
have got for my health and a hundred pounds. I
thought I’d bring it home. It might make you
another wedding-ring,” he added, trying to joke,
“if it was beaten out very thin.”
The woman did not regard the gold ; her eyes
dwelt on the man’s face with a wondering agony,
noting the lines and wrinkles strange to her. The
baby’s eyes were more active. Unnoticed, Ernie
took the slug off the table, and running with it to
the garden began to play with it.
The wife’s eyes were full of tears, her voice full
of chiding.
“ Oh, why did you go? If you had only listened
to me. I told you how it would be. To think of
a married man at your time of life leaving his
home to go to that horrid place. I knew those
papers were no better than a pack of lies. Better
a orust at home than a cake abroad.” She moved
about the room briskly getting a : meal ready, the
back of her hand going to her eyes every now and
then; “It’s not all gold that glitters—if you’d
only, listened to me and not been led away by all
those foolish yarns. ” .
He stood up to draw his chair to the table, and
she noticed now, more than at first, how the once
strong man was bent and emaciated. Sobs choked
her voice. “My God I How you must have suf-
fered. Why ever did you go ? ”
The baby gave a cry from the verandah, “ I
tan’t find it.”
“What have you lost, Ernie?” asked Maggie.
“ Dada’s ikkee dold marble’s dome, dome away.
I tan’t find it.”
N.S.W.
HENRY FLETCHER.
A witness, who was once a manufacturer
in England, told Vic. Commission on Old-Age
Pensions that his experience is that workmen who
drink too much are by no means worthless crea-
tures. On the contrary, he says, the drinking
man is usually the best workman, and earns the
best wages when he works at all.
Westralian Govt. * longs to tackle the
scheme of making Fremantle the first Australian
port of call for English mail steamers. The large
shipping companies are hard to convince of the
safety of the new harbor, and their objections
must be overcome before the agitation can be com-
menced in real earnest. Albany and the southern
districts will offer lively objection.
“ I wasgoingup St. James-st. about4a.m.,
the other day,” writes a Bulletin correspondent
from London, “and passing a church saw a
placard suspended from one of the pillars—“ This
church is now open for rest, meditation, and
prayer.” Leaning against the door, with his head
sunk upon his heart, was a well-dressed Johnnie,
dead-drunk. He had been deposited there to
“rest ” by some convivial companions.
Thus Alfred Walker on colony :
“ The social life is pleasant and natural, and
numbers are increasing every month. The work
is hard —hard labor to grind corn, pit-saw to cut
timber, wooden rollers and horse to crush sugar-
cane. Neither wheat-flour nor beef more than two
or three times a year; pork once a month,
fruit and vegetables abundant.” Goes on to
testify that New Australia is a dead failure. By
the way, Alfred owns a little coffee - plantation
there, run on purely individualistic principles.
The public school authorities of Australia
should agree to a uniform age for the admission of
children to State schools. The statutory school
age for admission in four provinces is six years,
and in three (taking Maoriland in the group) seven.
Circumstances, domestic and industrial, warrant
uniformity in this matter. The statutory age
for quitting school is 14 in some provinces where
the entrance is fixed at six, and 13 in others
where the entrance is at seven. Thus the statu-
tory age in N.S.W. is from 6 to 14, and in S. Aus-
tralia from 7 to 13.
“ Derx,” from Kalgoorlie, to The Bulle-
tin :
Be that stupid acrostio in Perth Table Talk. It is
ancient, so very ancient that I wonder its very odor
didn’t betray its initial offence. Its first acquaintance I
made in a Vic. mining township in ’74, when, as a boy, I
was shown the lines by a sort of professional eccentric
(bellman, bill-poster, and what not), who knew (or in-
vented) a history of it something like this (time and
place lost in the mists of oblivion) : —Rival editors —un-
dying hatred —Ha ! ha 1 R-r-revenge !! —This piece of dirt
concocted—sent to rival editor—printed—law proceedings
—ruin ! Villainy triumphant ! ! The second (and last)
time I saw it—or, rather, the first few lines of it —was in
a Coolgardie paper, with some comments, quite in Dead
Bird vein, which were simply an aggravation of the
original offence. Strange, a thing like that living for
nearly a quarter of a century, don’t you think?
Jim and Bill: A Moral .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jim and Bill were mates —at least, they travelled
together, and, when possible, worked together in
the season ; but they were opposite in character,
as most friends are.
Jim, the sober, steady man, invariably
“camped” out the slack, handy to some small
western town, and so made his season’s earnings
keep him in bare necessaries—bread, meat, and
tea—vegetables were unattainable luxuries to the
man who had to make about three months’ earn-
ings pay for nine months’ compulsory idleness.
Bill, the reckless, improvident one, as regularly
“ blued ” his cheque in the handiest coast-town,
and as regularly tramped back to the hospitality
of the provident and thrifty Jim, who kept him
till they resumed work in the season.
Well, Bill still “ carries on,” and when sober, is
just an ordinary live man. . . Jim? Oh!
Jim’s in the lunatic asylum—lost his reason
through incessant and unrelieved contemplation
of the exhilarating monotony of invariable same-
ness.
Westerners are mainly Jims and Bills —mostly
Bills.
C.A.J.T.
A church - bazaar is selling pill - boxes
labelled “ Bachelors’ pills—one to be taken in a
life-time.” When opened the “pill” is found
to be a miniature doll dressed as a bride. These
boxes sell like iced lager in the dog-days to simple
maidens anxious to convey a delicate hint to a
bashful lover.
Writes “ W.W.”
In lieu of the old rationing-out system, so objection-
able to station-hands, the ever-oblitring squatters in this
(Gilgunnia) district have substituted the following: —
The is charged (at station rates, of course) for all
stores supplied, and at the end of each quarter is credited
with £2 15s. —called “ ration allowance.” If the store-
account exceeds that amount, it is deducted from the
magnificent screw of 15s. per week. No wonder pas-
toralists need assistance in time of drought.
A Melb. wine merchant recklessly adver-
tised that he would give a glass of wine to every
caller during Jubilee week, and a sportive police-
man carefully cut out the notice and pasted it in
the prisoners’ “waiting-room” at Melb. City
Court. The result was—ye gods ! “I never had
any idea before that such disreputable men as
that read the papers,” said the broken-spirited
wine-seller to his clerk at the close of the first
day.
From the cablegram describing the presence
of “ all that was left ” of the famous Light Brigade,
at the Jubilee procession in London, it would ap-
pear that they who fought so well for Queen and
country have, at last, “ got their reward.”
Together stood that grey-haired band,
To watch the Queen pass by,
And. soon the Lady of the Land
Had “ caught them in her eye ; ”
She bowed with gracious queenly style,
With feelings truly deep,
And smiled a “Gracious Sovereign” smile
Because—to smile is cheap !

The Two Keys.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There was a Boy, long years ago,
Who hour by hour awake would lie,
And watch the white moon gliding slow
Along her pathway in the sky.
And ev’ry night as thus he lay
Entranced in lonely phantasy,
Borne swiftly on a bright moon-ray
There came to him a Golden Key.
And with that Golden Key the Boy
Oped ev’ry night a magic door,
That to a melody of Joy
Turned on its hinges evermore.
Then, trembling with delight and awe,
When he the charmed threshold crossed,
A radiant corridor he saw—
Its end in dazzling distance lost.
Great windows shining in a row
Lit up the wondrous corridor,
And each its own rich light did throw
In stream resplendent on the floor.
One window showed the Boy a scene
Within a forest old and dim,
Where Fairies danced upon the greeM
And kissed their little hands to him.
Sweet strains of elfin harp and horn
He heard so clearly sounding there,
And he to Wonderland was borne
And breathed its soft enchanted air.
Then, passing onward with the years,
He turned his back on Elf and Fay,
And, sadly sweet, as if in tears,
The Fairy Music died away.
The second window held him long:
It looked upon a field of fight
Whereon the countless hordes of Wrong
Fought fiercely with the Friends of Right.
And, 10, upon that fateful field
Where cannon thundered, banners streauud
And rushing squadrons rocked and reeled,
His sword a star of battle gleamed.
And when the hordes of Wrong lay still,
And that great fight was fought and won,
He stood, bright-eyed, upon a hill,
His white plume shining in the sun.
A glorious vision ! Yet behind
He left it with its scarlet glow,
And faint and far upon the wind
He heard the martial trumpets blow.
For to his list’ning ear was borne
A music more entrancing far
Than strains of elfin harp or horn,
More thrilling than the tramp of war.
No longer as a dreamy boy
He trod the radiant corridor:
His young man’s heart presaged a joy
More dear than all the joys of yore.
To that third window, half in awe,
He moved, and slowly raised his eyes—
And was it Earth grown young he saw ?
Or was it man’s lost Paradise ?
For all the flowers that ever bloomed
Upon the earth, and all the rare
Sweet Loveliness by Time entombed
Seemed blushing, blooming, glowing there.
And every mellow-thmated bird
That ever sang the trees among
Seemed singing there, with one sweet word
“ Love ! Love ! ” on every little tongue.
Then he by turns grew rosy-red,
And he by turns grew passion-pale.
“Sweet Love ! ” the lark sang overhead,
“ Sweet Love ! ” sang Love’s own nightingale.
In mid-heart of the hawthorn-tree
The thrush sang all its buds to bloom ;
“ Love ! Love ! Love ! Love ! Sweet Love,” sang
he
Amidst the soft green sun-flecked gloom.
She stood upon a lilied lawn,
With dreamful eyes that gazed afar :
A maiden tender as the Dawn,
And lovely as the Morning Star.
She stooped and kissed him on the brow,
And in a low sweet voice said she :
“ I am this country's queen—and thou ? ”
“I am thy vassal,” murmured he.
She hid him with her hair gold-red,
That flowed like sunshine to her knee ;
She kissed him on the lips, and said :
“Dear heart ! I’ve waited long for thee.”
And, oh, she was so fair, so fair,
So gracious was her beauty bright,
Around her the enamoured air
Pulsed tremulously with delight.
All sounds did then in music melt,
Bird-voices, scent of flower and tree,
And he within his bosom felt
The piercing thorn of ecstasy.
The years passed by in dark and light,
In storm and shine ; the man grew old,
Yet never more by day or night
There came to him the Key of Gold.
But ever ere the great sun-flowers
In gold above the sky’s blue rim,
All in the dark and lonely hours,
There comes an Iron Key to him.
And with that key he opes a wide
And gloomy door—the Door of Fate—
That makes whene’er it swings aside
A music sad and desolate.
A music sad from saddest source :
He sees beside the doorway set
The chill grey figure of Remorse,
The cold dead image of Regret.
For all the glory and the glow
Of Life are passed, and dead, and gone :
The Light and Life of Long Ago
Are only memories, moonlight-wan.
There is no man of woman born
So good, so great, so brave but he
Must in the middle night forlorn
Take up and use the Iron Key.
VICTOR DALEY.
“ Pomare’s Death.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of Hongi ika, the fiery ravager; of Hongi katan-
gata, the eater of men, many songs have been sung,
for he was the greatest chief in Maoriland when
the pakehas first came here to hunt whales : but
ot Pomare, Hongi’s fighting captain, little is
Known, and only the manner of his death is told
in song. Yet Pomare was a great warrior; so
huge of bulk that the ground shook under his
trea-d ; so skilful in war that no man could stand
against him, and he it was who fought by Hongi’s
side and trod the path of victory from Whan-
gs™l to the region of the Hot Lakes; from the
Kaiapara to the last stronghold of the Waikatos
at the head of the Waipa. Men feared Pomare •
women hated him ; and Panui cursed him night
and day, for Pomare had destroyed his pah and
slam Apia, of the terrible kiss, and it is of Panui
as much as of Pomare that the song is sung
When Hongi died Pomare was made chief, and
in his cruelty he resolved to march over the
country that Hongi had ravaged, for some of the
tribes had gathered together once more, and had
rebuilt the pahs. Now, among the tribes none
had recovered so quickly as Panui’s, and none
were so flourishing; and when Pomare heard of
this he remembered how once he had crushed
them to the earth, and he led his warriors South-
ward, sending messengers ahead to warn Panui of
his coming, and commanding him to offer himself
and his people as slaves. When Panui received
this command he held council with his tribe and
urged them to meet Pomare and fight the Nga-
puhis saying that it was better to die fighting
than live as slaves, and the men of the tribe cried
one and all, “ We will fight to the end.”
Then Panui left the chiefs in the council-house
and went to the whare of his son, a mere youth.
Ireta, ho said, “thou hast heard the song of
tny mother Apia s kiss, and how the Ngapuhi
who held her captive was slain. Thou knowest
how the Ngapuhis, under Hongi, destroyed our
pah, and how Pomare burned alive Apia, my wife
because she fought with the spear of that Ngapuhi
to whom she gave the kiss of death. Listen, then,
the Ngapuhis come once more against us, and
Pomare is at their head, and no man can stand
against Pomare; our only hope of victory lies in
Pomare s death. Heed now—l am an old man, I
am the chief of the tribe, I will engage Pomare in
battle, I will take his spear into my heart, but be
thou near, and while Pomare is slaying me do
thou thrust over my shoulder and slay him.”
So Ireta sharpened his spear and practised
thrusting over a man’s shoulder daily until the
Ngapuhis drew near and the battle began.
The Ngapuhis, in their pride, treated their foes
with disdain, and Pomare stood before his warriors
and shouted “Who will fight with me?” and
Panui rushed forward and cried: “I will fight
thee, Pomare, burner of Apia.” Pomare laughed
and replied : “ Thou art already dead 1 ”
* ‘ Nay ; but thou ! big and cruel, ” and he struck
at Pomare with his taiaha, and at this signal all
Panui’s warriors rushed on to battle.
Pomare played with his foe, and Panui defended
himself until he heard Ireta cry behind him: “I
am ready, father ! ” Then the old man lifted his
guard and received Pomare’s spear in his chest.
He seized it with his hands and stooped for-
ward, and as he stooped Ireta thrust over his
father’s shoulder and struck Pomare a fatal blow;
and when Pomare fell the Ngapuhis gave way and
fled. Thus a father’s sacrifice won a victory, and
revenged the death of Apia.
Maoriland.

A Westralian Newspaper Report.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A brilliant coterie last evening assembled at the
recently-erected handsome edifice known as the
Hungry-quartz Hotel, at the invitation of Mr. Mc-
Umty, the genial landlord. No expense has been
spared in the erection, which compares favorably
with any of our first-class city hotels —in fact, to
ensure satisfaction, Mr. McGinty was his own
contractor, and built it himself during his spare
hours.
The picturesque corrugated-iron walls of the
bar are decorated with artistic and costly frames,
C °Tor^ )aSS ' ll^- o^ eo^ra P^ 8 excee ding rich coloring
Mr. McGinty has ever been a patron of the fine-
arts. The room is brilliantly lighted throughout
with kerosene lamps. The two large 6xB rooms
at the rear are to be devoted solely to the use of
the popular landlord and family. It shows a
great confidence in our resources when capitalists
are willing to invest in such a truly regal manner.
Several gentlemen mostly engaged in under-
ground pursuits comprised the house-warming
Party Mr. McGinty, after a happy welcoming
speech, asked the company to drink success to the
house, which. request was acceded to with perfect
bon hommie in beakers of “ shypoo.”
“Two bob in and the winner shouts” was the
next item on the programme. The winner—Mr.
Stumpy Grumps, manager of the Slime Pits De-
partment of the Call Due G.M. Co., Ltd. —grace-
fully asked Mr. McGinty to now join his guests.
That gentleman smilingly bowed his acknowledg-
ment to the compliment paid him.
Mr. Scratchpen, the talented representative of
the Hoolgarlie Bustler, proposed the toast of
Mr. McGinty, coupled with the “ Queen ” and
the mining industry.
Mr. McGinty, in responding, said he was
pleased to have his name coupled with the Queen
on such an occasion as the Jubilee celebration
year. It was a time when all differences should
be sunk. From that moment he would sink all
resentment against Her Majesty, with whom he
had been on bitter terms for many years past. He
was content to let bygones be bygones. lie would
ask the guests to again fill their glasses.
Mr. Scratchpen was courteously conducted to
his cab by several of the company, and carefully
packed away in the bottom of the vehicle. The
act of vandalism of stealing the front-door, smash-
ing the window, and wrecking the rear of the
building, which ocourred later on in the evening,
is attributed to a low gang of ruffians from the
Other Side who have been frequenting the neigh-
borhood lately.

FOR
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
The above are indeed weighty words, of great import and value to
thousands of pale-faced, languid men and women, now tired and worn out
with worry, overwork, and disease, and who would be made well and strong
by the use of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. Bead also the following interesting
testimony of a prominent athlete :
627 Bourke St., Surry Hills, Sydney,
New South Wales, June 21, 1896.
“After being a victim to Typhoid, Brain, and Rheumatic fevers, in 1892, my
system was left in a terrible condition. Besides being very weak, I had numerous
abscesses on the lower part of my back and spine, from which a great number of
pieces of bone were taken. As fast as an abscess would appear and was lanced
another would form. I was treated at two different hospitals without success. The
surgeons in attendance informed me that I was suffering from blood poison. The
abscesses continued to appear, and I was never without pain, till six months ago I
was induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. When I had taken the first bottle I found
an improvement, and after finishing twelve bottles to-day I feel as well as ever I did
in my life; the abscesses have ceased to come,the old ones are all healed, and my
health is splendid. Before I used the Sarsaparilla I weighed 154 lbs., and now, after
using a dozen bottles, my weight is 200 lbs., which is a sure sign that I have been
taking the Champion Blood-Purifier of the world.”— George W. Walker, “Jumbo,”
