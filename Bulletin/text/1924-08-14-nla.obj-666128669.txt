They caiit fool me
said a passenger on the Express
A Palmolive enthusiast, delighted with the results secured from a
free test, was advising a fellow-passenger to send for a trial tube.
I would,” said the sceptic, " but I have a shaving soap I like and
they can’t fool me.”
That is what we have always claimed. Every man may be using
a shaving soap he likes and he can’t be fooled. But he can be in-
duced to try something better at our expense, and Palmolive Shaving
Crearn is better. After three years it now holds the first place for
these five reasons. ’
(1) It multiplies itself 250 times in rich lather.
(2) The lather lasts for 10 full minutes on the face.
(3) It softens the toughest beard in 60 seconds.
(4) The lather bubbles are tenacious, holding the hair*
erect for easier, cleaner cutting.
iP) The after-effects are delightful, due to palm and olive oils. ‘
Secure a free ten-shave test tube. You will find it will do all we claim it
will. Cut out the form below.

Homer and the Higher Criticism
Whatever humorist it was—l have his
words but not his name—who said that the
upsnot ot the controversy as to the author-
snip ot the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey” ap-
peared to be that they were not written by
llomer, but by another gentleman of the
same name, he not merely made many of
us laugh but also provided reactionaries with
an excellent jape agailist those dreadful
higher critics, ’ and the ordinary man (who
hadly needs it) with comforting re-assur-
ance. Nevertheless, in spite of all the jest-
ing and sophistry, inquiry refuses to be
?nd the comfortable wiiole-hoggers
,or Homeric unity are destined to hear things
that will hurt their ears. And it will soon
avail them nothing to cry in public : “If this
be so, then let us all turn Baconians” and
tiie like. They have too often troubled the
water to further their fishing, and the catch-
word ‘ higher critic” is losing its power.
~, i *\i W i al A is this tlling tlle y object to so
much that they would exorcise with a ques-
tionable name? “Higher” sounds so suspi-
cious, and lias such ill-omened relationships,
iveafly,, there is no “higher” criticism and no
lower ; there is one mental process applied
in diverse fields of inquiry. And the Homeric
question is not, primarily, a question of
authorship In pursuit of the plain task of
understanding the literature which one
studies, there comes the necessity to analyse
every work of any dimensions to the end
that one may reconstruct it. in one’s mind
as an organic whole. Hence the primary
question, Is such and such work a unity?—---
a question which arises not merely with re-
el)*’ 1 * to the “Iliad” but with regard to
i ' ai ?d “Faust.” The answer will
be different in each case, and in each case
inquiry will conduct ns to certain external
conditions which will satisfactorily explain
tlio elements that are unsatisfactory to us
m the object of analysis. Sliakspeare did
not quite overcome the refractory matter,
because lie was not working freely on the
(.ata of legend, but began by adapting an-
other man s play; Goethe failed entirely be-
cause from the beginning his sketches were
S r . a Jfaust of whom his conception shifted
with his turbulent moods; and when he
came, much later in life, to reduce them to
unity, the work of his own youth proved
more refractory to him than the earlier
-Ti an b, et . to Shakspeare. The case of the
Iliad is another, yet analogous: it is a
unity, as such the work of one man, the, first
in history to conceive of a work on the grand
scale, the creator of the epic poem. But
the unity is not organic, for the parts were
not conceived as parts of that whole or writ-
ten tor the place they now occupy.
There are some who raise another previ-
ous objection. After all, we read Homer for
the poetry: why not enjoy it without all this
fuss.' 1 As if once more we could avoid the
question of unity; for, leaving the formal
aspect of unity, we may shift to their own
ground and meet them there. This thing
poetry, with which you say you are alone
concerned, is a high spiritual energy. Now,
ah spiritual energy is of the individual:
tiie higher it is the more individual. Does
the continued study of “Homer” reveal
different poetic individualities? The different
authorship of different parts of “Homer” is,
then not the pre-supposed question from
vvliicli this much-maligned “higher criticism”
starts: it is a result forced upon us by
the inevitable duty of attempting to account
tor the artistic unity of the “Homeric”
poems. As for the historical personalities
and names of the authors, it would indeed
be pleasant to know something: all we can
at present hope to determine, to a certain
degree, is what share the very real poet called
Homer had in the making of this poetry, and
wfiy, ot all poets’ names, his alone was at-
tached to the whole mass of Greek epic. He
was not the maker of our “Iliad.” That
poet presents what at first sight is a curious
discrepancy between architectonic genius
and detailed _ executive power. The plan
of the Iliad ’ is grandiose, the membering
ot its parts by means of the three great
pauses, the balance of opening and close the
work of original genius. But the minor in-
sertions which are necessary to connect the
discrepant parts, the ties whose removal
would cause the whole composition to dis-
integrate, are often poor, even wretched
from every point of view. The reason is
simple. The “Iliad” was constructed out
of old and splendid poetry at a period when
that class of poetry had not merely entered
on its decline, but was almost extinct. The
author of the "Iliad;” when he comes to
forC r to write in a language and

Greek literature is extended, the original
creative genius of Athens is dated back by a
hundred years: but we are still searching
for the real Homer and for that creative
act of his which had as its reward that every
of her name than Ins wfis forgotten y
The opening of the “Iliad” tells us. The
poem is the poem of Ilion, and as such an
independent poet would have described it in
his invocation, “Sing, Muse, of iE, and
all the toil of the Achaeans m the ten years’
war. ’ " But our “Iliad” announces as its
theme, “the wrath of Achilles.” Its com-
poser could not and would not dare to sup-
liress the splendid proem to that other epic,
‘Hof indeed in relation to his (a quarter or
little more of its bulk), but its necessary
pre-condition, both as a smaller-scale model
of composition . and as an already classic
creation, of heroic character and presentation
of heroic action. The figures of Achilles
and Patroklus, of Aias and Hektor, as the
imagination of the world still knows them,
go back to that poem now nearly 27 cen-
tunes old. It represents the high-water mark
of the. older epic poetry, its fullest develop-
ment in characterisation, in tragic intensity
ot narrative, in splendor of style and verse.
j* e . have seen that the composer of the
Iliad ’ belongs to the last period before the
art becomes, utterly extinct. This poem is
older than liis by at least two centuries; and
just as old is the tradition of a poet named
Homer, born at Smyrna, and afterwards
resident at Chios. There is no ground for
rejecting that tradition; and we should be
strange ascetics if we were to refuse the j'oy
or associating his name with the poem on
the wrath of Achilles.”
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
Burns—and Another
If anything were wanted to prove the small
real appreciation that Scotland has for the
work of her chief poet it might be found
in the acceptance at sight in so many Scot-
• v!r Uar -i ers certa i n veises recently found
in Maoriland. Burns is supposed to have
written the lines to Jessie Lewars during his
last days, and it is asserted that tfrev have
been secretly treasured since 1796 by rela-
tives and friends of relatives who never
thought it worth while to bring them to light.
Un the face of it the story is hard to be-
lieve. Any relic of Burns which any Scotch-
rrlan possessed would in the ordinary nature
ot things have long ago been brought forth
and acclaimed. The , poorest snatches -of
obscene doggerel which were thought to have
any connection with him have been published
n L-\ 's c< ? l]ecte d works; and much of the
attributed verse is without a semblance of
merit or distinction. But here is a poem
with a good deal of feeling, and written
vulh some skill, alleged to have been brought
to light after a century and a quarter, and
described by a Scottish paper as “worthy
of Burns at Ins best” !
has produced but one poet who
takes first rank ; of her other bards few, if any
could claim more than a slightly distinguished
mediocrity. ,1 It ought be thought that tens
of thousands of people in Scotland would
wort of n de - ep a feeling for the distinctive
work of their one great man that they would
recognise his mark anywhere. But such
does not appear to be the case. The inner
knowledge of a poet’s work is only possible
to those who know the work of many poets’
It is by comparison that distinctiveness is
shown; and the inference is that Scotland
does not read poetry and is only devoted to
the Burns tradition, not to the Burns song?
Here are the verses found in Maoriland:
Th ® s .™ .tjes clasped in amber cloud
Half-hidden in the sea;
And o er the sand the flowing tide
Comes racing merrily.
The hawthorne hedge is white with bloom,
The wind is soft and lown,

But puirtith’s blast sifts summer love.
And makes leal friendships few.

And wonder in my weary brain

Who whistled at the plough
And wrote a simple song or two
For happier hearts to sing

Burns could not have written that Not
one verse of it is in his; manner, nor in the
manner of anybody else who wrote before
the middle of the nineteenth century. Many
of the phrases are of the well-known stock-in-
trade of journalist poets who filled the maga-
mnes in the time of Mrs. Browning and
Tennyson. The verses are full of a Scottish
religiosity—sincere enough, but following a
well-beaten track. It is more than probable
that a diligent search through the old files
of such magazines as “Good Words” would
reveal the original in fair large print over
a name that is not Burns. The thing is a
piece of good workmanship, feminine in
shape and expression, but without any hint

Francis Prout Mahony
A Maltese cross of marble in tlie cemetery
of Hanwell, in English Middlesex, marks
the resting-place of Australian painter hra
Mahony, who died in a London lnhrnn
during the third year of the Great Y\ ai.
was possibly the first in Australia to hear
his death, and that came about m this way.
While my two sons were on leave from tne
Front, they spent a furlough in London, t
an evening one of them went into a tona -
conist’s shop in Portobello-road. the tona -
conist was in a wine-and-walnuts mooa or
reminiscence. “I see,” said he, "by your na
you are an Australian. Well, I knew an
Australian who lived about here an artist
—a tall, dark man, with grey hair. He used
to get remittances from Australia; and then
they left off coming; and he got ill, ana
went into an infirmary, and died there. My
son managed to establish the identity of the
dead artist, and wrote me a detailed account
of his discoveries. . .
Born on December 4. 1862, in 1 attic
Flinders-street, Melbourne, Australia s lore-
most artist of animal life, and particularly ot
horses and dogs, was 54 when he succumbed.
His monument bears this inscription: in
memory of our first Australian-born artist,
Francis Prout Mahony—lB62-1916. Erected
to his memory by Australian admirers.
Mahony was not, however, “our first Austra-
lian-born artist.” That distinction, it the
accident of birthplace can be called a dis-
tinction,” belongs to Adelaide Eliza Ironside,
born in Sydney 30-odd years before Mahony.
The late Thomas Dibbs cherished a portrait-
sketch of himself, as a lad of 17, from the
pencil of that gifted young artist, who was
cut off in her 36th year. Moreover, Mahony s
second name of “Prout” was self-assumed,
lie adopted it because the Rev. 1 rancis
Mahony (the. “Oliver Yorke” of 1 RASEii s
Magazine) had chosen the sobriquet of
“Father Prout” for the versified jciix d esprit
afterwards collected as his “Reliques.
Frank’s mother was of Cornish stock, a tail,
stately, dark and distinguished old lady ; and
the artist himself was tall and dark, and un-
commonly “Donnish” in carriage and aspect.
His brother, William Henry Mahony, a
solicitor, was M.L.A. for Annandale
(N.S.W.) for 16 years.
In the days of the. “Picturesque Atlas
Publishing Co. the .artist shared with land-
scape-painter A. 11. Fullwood a studio in
Paling’s Buildings—-a significant period m
the history of art in Australia, when George
and Arthur Collingridge. and others, founded
the Art Society of N. S. Wales, which held
its first exhibition of paintings, etc., m the
upper rooms of the Royal Arcade. Mahony
exhibited in the opening collection in 1888,
and few annual shows passed without some-
thing representative from his brush. I think
he sent a couple of oils and a water-color
to this inaugural display; at any rate, a
large canvas in the former medium I have
the kindliest reason to remember: it was en-
titled. rather unhappily, "Cliaff-cutting on
the Banks of the Hawkesbury —a typical
“gallery” picture of mammoth dimensions
which he sent me as a wedding gift 33 years
ago.
No man was better known to the trainers,
stable-boys and jockeys of the racing stables;
the Zoo * was a drawing-room resort of his,
where he was never tired of. observing and
sketching; and he was held in high, esteem
by the slaughtermen out at the abattoirs. On
one occasion he bought a crock which, like an
early Christian, was "condemned to the lions.
He shored it up against the decrepit fence
of the artist who lived next door, fed it on
bran-mashes, and sketched away for dear life
But the poor moke died on his hands, and
Mahony was at the expense of having Neddy
carted away in a corporation dray. Once he
brought to his mother’s house the. head of a
very line bullock which he had secured from
the abattoirs: and he kept working at it until
his household and the neighborhood were
moved to expostulation. On a third occa-
sion he nailed or spiked up on the walls of
his make-shift studio, which adjoined the
offices of the lawyer firm of Slattery and
Heydon, the head of a horse, the study of
which occupied him for a month, and raised
more malodorousness than any suit of . legal
enterprise. “Rounding up a Straggler” was
painted on the Botany sandhills; the horse
in the picture was sketched from a mount
belonging to Mr. Powell, the Curator of the
Moore Park Zoo; and Mr. Powell, an accom-
plished bushman of the old school, played the
part of stockman, in shirt-sleeves and leggings,
on mornings before the world was awake.
Besides “Rounding up a Straggler,” the
National Art Gallery possesses of Mahony’s
work three pictures in oils—“A Spring Morn-
ing,” “The Cry of the Mothers,” and “As in
the Days of Old,” and three studies in black-
and-white. “A Spring Morning” was begun
at Broomfield Hill, and finished on South
Head, Sydney; “The Cry of the Mothers”
was the result of a suggestion Mahony got
from seeing some mares with their foals cut
off by a freshet, on the Wyong Creek; whilst
“As in the Days of Old” was actually com-
posed from a bush race between a teamster on
an excellent mount and the mail-carrier
through a cutting on the road from Wyong
to Corranbong. At Broomfield Hill Mahony
painted “The Bullock Team,” or, rather,
the first and the second pictures so called,
for there were two completed and separate
works, though the same team “sat” for both.
The first picture painted in the district was
named (by myself, at Mahony’s request for
a title) “The Bushrangers,” and represented
some half-dozen working horses escaped from
their daily drudgery, and roaming, at their
own sweet will, through the timbered ranges,
in truant joyousness. Mahony, by the way,
painted “The Bullock Team” under tremen-
dous difficulties, half-mad with a combined
attack of influenza and neuralgia, and ren-
dered madder by the intermittent rain-
showers which held him up during the day-
light, with the wastage of 20 shillings per
diem to the bullocky for the use of his
team. “As in the Days of Old” was of my
naming, for Mahony did not care for the
title which he gave the picture, to wit, “A
Race for Life in the Days of Bushranging,
which, truth to tell, was sufficiently accurate,
but long enough for a panorama,
Frank Mahony' was the tenth ot a family
of 11, and his family came to Sydney when
the future artist was only 10. One, day he
and I went into a hotel on the Blue s 1 oint-
road because he wished me to see a framed
drawing, very highly colored, which hung on
the wall. It consisted of a series ot scenes ot
barnyard life —cocks and hens, game roosters
fio-hting, etc.—-and was drawn with much
spirit and vivacity. “I did that when I was
a kid at school,” said Mahony, ‘and swapped
it for a penknife or something, to the son
of the landlord here!” Whilst in an archi-
tect’s office he studied at the old Academy
of Art under Signor Anivitti. He expressed
always great appreciation of the encourage-
ment he received from Frederic Villiers, the
war artist, to whom he was introduced on the
occasion of the celebrity’s first visit to Syd-
ney. Mahony never lacked friends, though
he had a terribly temperamental habit ot.
trying them to breaking point. Among his
consistent helpers were' such diverse per-
sonalities as Dean Slattery, William Macleod
and Charles Olliver. But he was a difficult
man to get along with. He was generous to the
very verge of improvidence, and as tetchy
as Malvolio. He was, when in the mood,
kindlv-liearted and hospitable. But he was
also sensitive to an absurdity, a long nurser
of supposititious slights, quick to quarrel and
slow to forgive. He was earnest and eager
to counsel and instruct younger men strug-
gling on the margin of the art in which he
himself was always a learner. His favorite
maxim was : “Study every school till it breaks
your heart; then put every school aside and
do your damnedest.”

Immortality
I stretch lame hands of faith, and grope
And gather dust and chaff, and call
To what I feel is Lord of all,
And faintly trust the larger hope..
So wrote Tennyson, ‘'an optimist by tem-
perament and an eclectic in philosophy.
Browning, equally optimistic, closed Ins
“Easter Day” with the lines: —
Christ rises! Mercy every way
Is infinite —and who can sayV
“A faith,” says Maurice Hewlett, “which
can only bo expressed in a sighed question,
is not one to sustain the many; but such
as it is the poets of our day cannot better
l, '“ -if men die shall they cease to live?’
There is no other question that lias stirred
human hearts so deeply, for so long a
period, over such vast spaces of the habit-
able globe,” says Lord Ernhe 111 an intro-
duction to the volume of contributions from
theologians, philosophers and scientists
grouped under the title Immortality (1 nt-
lmin's Sons, and Angus and Robertson).
This book seeks to coyer succinctly, not
exhaustively, the field of thought upon its
subject. The contributors are drawn
mainly from the English and Scotch univer-
sities—Oxford, Cambridge, London, Edin-
burgh—the notable exception being a contri-
bution from Sydney University by Professor
R. (f. Macintyre, who holds the brief for “The
Christian Idea of Immortality.” Egyptian
conceptions, Greek views, Hebrew 7 and
Indian thought are covered by specialists m
each of these sections. The Poet, too, is
given liis place, and the Philosopher and the
Scientist.
Interesting as the historical reviews are
the reader’s attention will probably centre
on the modern religious, philosophical and
scientific outlooks. “The Christian view,
says Professor Macintyre, “with its belief in
:i supreme personal being who has revealed
Himself in the beauty and order of the world,
in saints and prophets, and finally in Ilis Son
Jesus Christ, bases all its hopes and
thoughts upon that supernatural fact.” He
claims that man belongs “essentially to the
spiritual, and the spirit of man and the
Spirit of God have relations of dependency
and obligation. It is in this relationship
to God who is Life that the Christian doc-
trine of immortality has its source and in-
spiration.” The filial relation of man to God
is everything to Christianity. Sin is a
violation of this bond of love between them,
with a consequent loss of fellowship: to
have this fellowship restored is immortality.
The Christian may accept the teaching of
science that man has evolved from lower
forms of animal life, “but the main point
is not where he has come from, or how
he has come, but what he has become." Man
has passed out of the mere category of ani-
mal, and become “a member of that moral
order which is the expression of the divine
nature.” The Christian view of immortality
is therefore “based upon a conception of God
as holy love seeking to raise man to a higher
stage of moral and spiritual life, and into
closer fellowship with Himself.”
Dr. George Galloway, of the Scottish Uni-
versity of St. Andrew, sets out the philo-
sophical aspect. He repudiates any
responsibility on the part of philosophy for
the creation of the idea of immortality. That
was presented to it by religion. “If,” he
says, “we restrict ourselves to what science
and metaphysics can tell us, the problem of
a life after death is likely to end in a note
of uncertainty.
It may be that the gulf will wash us down,
It may be we shall touch, the Happy Isles,
lie seeks a more assured and steadfast
hope in “our perception of the significance
of spiritual personality” and “faith in the
goodness of God, who will conserve what
deserves to be conserved. For God, as Plato
felt, cannot will to destroy His own' highest
handiwork.”
Science has its spokesman in Canon
Barnes, then of Westminster, a Doctor of
Science, who declares that “the belief
that human personality survives the dis-
solution of the body is neither con-
firmed nor discredited by ‘natural science.’
There is no direct conclusive evidence of
consciousness apart from life, or for the
existence of life apart from matter.” Like
the philosopher, he betakes himself to hope.
After all, natural science is a construction
of the human mind, and that mind has its
limitations. “As to what life is in itself we
are ignorant. A greater knowledge may open
up a wider field, and carry the principle of
life far beyond the limits of our present
vision. Confidence that our faculties enable
us to perceive and value reality external to
ourselves cannot be established by cogent
argument. It must remain an assumption
of reasonable faith.” .
To sum up: The Christian bases his faith
on a supernatural revelation of God through
His Son and a spiritual nexus between the
Father and Ilis children. The Philosopher
has not made up his mind, but on broad
economic grounds he sees no meaning in life
that ends in the destruction of what it has
created. To some intelligible object to be
attained, some divine event to which creation
moves, he pins his faith. The Scientist can
find nothing at the bottom of his crucible in
the nature of immortality, but beyond the
walls of his laboratory there is a world of
knowledge yet to be explored. Mayhap, some
day, immortality may be found there —who
knows? Not he.
So it ends that we come out by the
door we went in, our doubts not dissi-
pated, the veil not lifted, but still perhaps
clinging to “the larger hope.”

Gordon’s Australian Note
Again the criticism is levelled against
Gordon that he never became Australian;
and, though lovers of Gordon cannot and
would not shut their eyes to certain facts,
at the same time his authentic Australian
note should be insisted upon. Certainly
many of his more popular pieces are wholly
English, such as “How We Beat the Favo-
rite,” “Britomarte” and the “Song of
Autumn” ; but the bulk of his verse is neither
English nor Australian. Gordon knew his
limitations: he was no keen observer. He
did not, therefore, seek to use much “local
color.” I know of only two Gordon refer-
ences to Australian birds, and both are
faulty. In “Finis Exoptatus” he refers to
our jovial friend the kookaburra as a jay, and
considers his uproarious mirth harsh —
Harshly breaks those peals. of laughter
From the jays aloft.
This has been followed with an interesting
variation by his fellow-Englishman, Marcus
Clarke, in the famous preface:—
The sun suddenly sinks, and the mopokes burst out
into horrible peals' of semi-human laughter.
The other reference is in the same poem
• Yon small bird his hymn outpouring
On the branch close by
Reeks not for the kestrel soaring
In the nether sky,
Though the hawk with wings suspended
Poises overhead.
Motionless as though suspended
By a viewless thread.
It would have been a good picture of our one
native kestrel and our only hoverer if the
kestrel were a hawk; but it isn’t, and small
birds do not fear it, for it never preys upon
them. „ ,
So Gordon was a poet of human action
and of introspection, but not of observation.
He neither loved nature like Wordsworth nor
observed it like Tennyson; but within his
limits his is the real Australia, painted from
the personal knowledge of a bushman. He
wrote, too, it ought to be remembered, m
the days when Australians were merely
“colonials” and when our national spirit
was only in the making. Yet he did set the
fashion of the horse, which has been followed
so well by Ogilvie, Paterson and others; and
in spite of liis Iseults, Cotswolds and Black
5® IfSSe'ffl
considered his friend’s the be o imnn»
Wold” U S “cL rede fteterit iEtw” ! And
in “Finis Exoptatus” (Gordon was always
fascinated by Latin tags), that most musical
n l versos— “ Hark, the bells on distant
battle '”—is alive with the elusive magic of
the real out-of-doors Australia, m sPjte ?
tlie old-world memory of sweet St. Mary .
Tf-mv still doubt, let him recall the fine pi-.;
Kre of explorer Burke’s death m “Gone
ond the sick stockrider’s dying memories of
?h« old ertonial days ; or let tam turn ag„n
the galloping dedication of Bash tsat

tf, see he will recognise the real Australia
sung as none but an Australian could sing it.

Mabuse might have been its author.
Percy Bysshe Shelley, by Henry S. Salt (Allen and
Unwin). ‘ This biography chiefly deals with the
poet as a revolutionary and anti-clerical. He hated
the Church of England as “a system of exclusion and
bitterness,” and the Government as the force respon-
sible for the cruelties that he saw perpetrated in
the name of the law. But did Shelley reason on
such questions? Was he a conscious philosopher in
his burning poems of revolt, or “the eternal child
that Gilfillan saw? Dir. Salt takes the former view
and supports it with spirit and eloquence. Much is
made of Byron’s influence, little is said of Godwin
and hardly anything of Keats.

Royal Cord Tyres Are
Now Made by Three
New Processes Which
Have Revolutionized
Tyre Making
THE development by the United States Rubber Company of
three remarkable new processes of rubber manufacture now
gives to Royal Cord Tyres a quality never before reached by
any tyre.
I. The New Sprayed Rubber. A method so effective that
a virgin rubber ol a quality never known until now is made
available to the world.
2. The New Web Cord. Of Specific application to the art
of cord tyre making. A process of treating fabrics and cords
with latex, making it possible to manufacture tyres and other
articles with a degree of strength hitherto unattained.
3. The New Flat-Band Building Process. A method of
building cord tyres which is revolutionary. Finally and at
last assuring uniform cushioning and resistance in cord tyres.
Taken alone, either of these new discoveries would be regarded as
of the utmost significance, but together they are hailed as the most
important advance in the field of rubber manufacture since the
discovery of vulcanization nearly a century ago.
These three basic discoveries, fully protected by patents in the
U. S. A. and other countries, are the exclusive property of the
United States Rubber Company, makers of Royal Cord Tyres.

Frictional resistance to
the rebound of the car is
secured by the action of
these two friction discs,
placed on both sides of
the steel drum, which
contains the coiled spring.
This eliminates frictional
wear on the strap,
and provides perfectly-
balanced resistance to the
rebound.
The Stewart Strap is sub-
jected to no more friction
than is a string when
being wound on to a
pencil.
By means of the LITTLE
RED WRENCH provided,
the car owner can readily
adjust the Stewart Shock
Absorber to suit his own
judgment. Only a par-
tial turn of the adjusts
ing nut is needed.
In the Stewart principle
the strap acts un-
hindered. As soon as one
shock has been absorbed
the strap is immediately
drawn back into the
drum, ready for the next
jolt.

The Unloved.
I have loved the yellow day.
And shall I not love the night,
Though the stars faint away
And the moon give no light?
I have loved the song that drew
The sweetness of each day's life;
Shall I not love silence, too,
That is song’s true wife?
I have loved the swift air
Fighting me over the hill;
Shall I not find as fair
The wind that has no will?
I have greatly loved to live
Each moment of eager breath ;
But. I know not how I shall give
Praise of desire to death.

Blown from the sea ;
Just a leaf that danced awhile
And fell from a tree:
Just a thin;; that isn't there —
Something they call me!
Sometimes a brown bird
Sings a song that's mine;
A strange familiar voice calls
When the winds whine;
And I have picked bits of me
Out of sunshine.
Perhaps I might be someone
If they would combine!
Just a bit of star-dust
Escaped from the sky,
Held down by a bit of earth,
Lest it should fly.
I wonder what it’s all about —

Carries a fragrant cargo to the town.

THE FEDERAL MAZE AND THE
WAY OUT.
The lialf-Priministers are gloomily realis-
ing that trouble is the portion of those who
won’t leave well alone. Their Government
was working amicably, and to some extent
usefully, when the Nationalist leader per-
suaded himself that it couldn’t get along
unless each party represented in it bound
itself not to contest seats held by the other.
The Country party leader agreed with him,
or was overborne. The arrangement thus
arrived at was communicated to their aston-
ished colleagues and followers through the
newspapers. Presently it was referred to
the Federal party organisations, whose dele-
gates were hastily summoned to Melbourne
for the purpose. Meanwhile it dawned upon
the Nationalists that the agreement ignored
the legitimate claims of men who had served
them faithfully and who had been narrowly
beaten by Cockies at an election distin-
guished by unusually small polls —Massy
Greene, sometime M.H.It. for Richmond
(N.S.W.) and Minister for Customs;
Wise, formerly M.H.It. for Gippsland and
Postmaster-General; and Chanter, M.H.It.
from 1901 till 1922, with two short breaks.
The Agrarians, for their part, learned that
they were expected to sacrifice McWil-
liams, their first leader (M.11.R. for Frank-
lin from 1903 till 1922), and Fleming
(Page’s deputy for a time as well as M.H.R.
for Robertson) ; worse still, they were to accept
the principle that their youthful party had no
right to grow ini 1925 at the expense of the
Nationalists, or even at that of the Lab.or-
ites if it were so decided by men controlling
the machinery of pre-selection. They Avere
likewise reminded by Stewart, Minister for
Works and Railways, and Proavse, M.H.R.
for Swan, that they had taken a stand
against the pre-selection business, whereas
pre-selection of sitting members of the House
of Reps, was implied in the leaders’ agree-
ment and expressed as regards Senators due
to face the ljiusic next year, avlio were on no
account to be opposed.
* * * *
After discussing these points, or some of
them, the Federal executives of the associ-
ated parties arrived at a compromise. The
Brtjce-Page treaty was approved of, subject
to the exclusion of Richmond, Riverina,
Gippsland, Corio and Bendigo (Robertson
was evidently forgotten) ; but the pleni-
potentiaries pointed out that they had no
poAver to speak for Tasmania, the Speck
Farmers being independent of the Federal
body, or, in fact, to bind the State organisa-
tions on the mainland. The Nationalist
chief took a fortnight to consider the joint
report in which these conclusions were em-
bodied. Then he announced in his most
pontifical manner that he was “prepared to
accept the report as a substantial approval
of the arrangement entered into by Mr. Page
and myself, and as a satisfactory endorse-
ment of the conditions laid down as essential
to the continuance of the composite Govern-
ment,” conditionally upon the State organisa-
tions ratifying it. “Subject to this being
done” (and “I am asking for meetings to be
held immediately”) he would agree to remain
at the head of the Government and fight the
next election as the Nationalist-Cocky Focii
—or LudenDorff. Considering the circum-
cumstances in which lie, a young politician,
became leader of the Nationalists and in the
same week Prime Minister Avithout a party
majority, this condescension is rather over-
whelming. Especially when it is recalled that
the Nationalists have lost numerous seats at
five recent general elections; that the Agrar-
ians, who haA'e held their own in the constitu-
encies, are to abandon principles and pros-
pects for the privilege of being led to battle
by King Bruce ; and that the election agree-
ment, even in its modified form, aims at
restricting the choice of anti-Labor electors
to sitting members. Rather than be parties
to a shabby pre-selection manoeuvre, and to
artificial restrictions being imposed on the
growth of the Cocky movement, Steavart
has resigned as Works Minister and Proavse
as Agrarian Whip. With this honorable ex-
ample before them, some of the State Cocky
organisations are unlikely to acquiesce in an
agreement which, among other things, forbids
the Westralians to oppose Pearce, Lynch
and Drake-Brockman, and the Victorians to
nominate against Elliott, Guthrie and
Russell, if those Senators decide to stand
again. In any case it looks as if the days
of the composite Government Avere numbered.
* * * *
With a sidelong glance at Commonwealth
developments in Melbourne, Brunner, leader
of the State Cookies, avlio call themselves
Progressives. addressed the N. S. Wales
Farmers and Settlers’ Conference last week
in the following strain :
I do not hold with any agreement with any other
party for carrying out an election. AVe stand, above
all, for no pre-selection. It is most difficult to get
away from the power and control over politicians that,
pre-selection gives the selectors. Pre-selection has
killed polities as far as this State is concerned.
It has handed over the politician to the political
machine.
The last statement is true of other parts
of the Commomvealth as Avell as N. S. Wales.
But the Bruce-Page pact introduces a new
variety of an old political swindle, inasmuch
as a host of sitting members (some of mean
abilities, and others with poor records) have
been pre-selected by two of their number 18
months before the appeal to the people. Its
authors coolly suggest that the preservation
of their Government is so important to Aus-
tralia that it warrants an extension of the
process of converting those who should be
representatives of the people into mere mari-
onettes, and a further encroachment upon the
rights of . constituencies; but the price is
far too high. The obvious remedy for the
situation in the National Parliament is an
elective Ministry. It is the obvious remedy
likewise for the situation in the Victorian
Parliament, where a minority Labor Govern-
ment has succeeded a minority Liberal Govern-
ment ; and for that in the Queensland Parlia-
ment, where the 44-hour working week is
about to be imposed on a State that can’t
afford it, at the instance of a feAv extremists,
and where recent events have disclosed that
there are really two Labor parties, as, indeed,
there are in N. S. Wales. Third narties, as
Brunner claims, have a right to exist, and
where their aims and methods are honest
they may be of great political utility. But
the public is entitled to guarantees that they
will not abuse their power by making govern-
ment unstable or securing corrupt advantages
for the section they represent. These guar-
antees would be forthcoming if Brunner’s
party, and Page’s, and all the other Agrarian
groups declared for Ministries formed on the
elective principle. With preferential voting
and elective Ministries there would be no
occasion for pre-selection or undemocratic
“pacts.” Elective Ministries would raise the
low level of administrative performance,
secure honest discussion of legislature and
financial proposals, and bring about an abate-
ment of that excessive party spirit which is
hindering the country’s progress and endan-
gering its future.
THE MENACE OF FREETRADE.
The settlement with Germany on lines which
will assist the Empire’s late enemies to re-
construct themselves economically has ad-
vanced so many stages that it may now be
taken as read, whatever hitches arise before
finality is reached. Cobdenites here, as in
Britain, arc hailing the development as a
triumph for their cause, and so, of course, it
is. It amounts so far as Britain is concerned
not merely to fiscal disarmament but to
making the enemy a present of ammunition.
There are. no doubt, arguments for such a
step. The abstract morality of pacifism is
indisputable. There should even be profit for
some in the gesture—anyhow, for a time.
The recent comment of John Maynard
Keynes, representative of the British Trea-
sury at the Paris Peace Conference, that. “Bri-
tain was investing too much capital abroad,
especially in the Dominions and colonies.”
Avas significant. Germany Avill be set on her
feet partly with the money of British manu-
facturers, and the first step in the coming
campaign to prove that all good Britons
should invest in Germany is naturally a de-
monstration that it is uneconomic to invest
in Australia and Maoriland. An English
motor- or film- or liat-making firm that sets
up behind the tariff Avails of the Fatherland
should do very well, seeing that, even since
the fixation of Avages in rentenmarks, skilled
workers in nearly all trades are earning only
half what they did in 1914, while some are
working 10 and others 12 hours a day. But
Avlmt of England—England the nation?
* * * *
Hardly anyone disputes that England's
great manufacturing industries Avere estab-
lished and held for centuries chiefly by Pro-
tection. The skill of the English Aveavers
and the quality of the Cotswold wool doubt-
less had much to do with the rise of the
weaving industry in England, but Avhat estab-
lished it was the law of Edward lll.’s day
enacting that no one, other than royalties,
should Avear cloth made outside the realm.
That decree nearly ruined Bruges and Ypres,
but it enriched thousands of English work-
ers. From then until the middle of last
century the British protected any industry
that appeared Avortli it, and the kingdom
flourished as much as costly wars, bungled
peaces, pestilences and illiteracy would per-
mit. At the worst it never went back in
power and prestige; and, though English-
men might be driven abroad by bigotry or
tempted by the desire for adventure, they
never had to expatriate themselves to escape
starvation. It has taken 50 years of Free-
trade to bring the nation that originated
modern industrialism into the emigration
category occupied before the war by such
countries as Poland and Ireland, miserable
places whose best young men and women fled
from them in thousands every year. Three
conditions are essential if a modern nation
is to become, or remain, great. Its people
must be willing and able to inhabit it, wages
must be high relatively to the cost of living,
and the tally of unemployed must not be
excessive. Unless a country has these things
nowadays its foundations are as unstable
as those of old Venice, which in one genera-
tion Avas the greatest trading-mart in
Europe, and in the next—oAving to Vasco
da Gama’s discovery of a sea road to India
—was ruined. Some figures published in the
International Labor Review of May last
show that Britain is already in a bad
way. In March, 1923, the proportion of
British trade unionists unemployed was 12.3
per cent. (The month is taken at random:
in the same month the previous year the
figures were 16.3, and the year before 10.0.)
In Germany in March, 1923, the unemployed
proportion was 5.6 ; in Canada, 6.8; in Bel-
gium, 0.8; in Massachusetts (the only U.S.
State analysed), 6.2; and in Australia, 7.2.
The average weekly earnings for the same
month of the same year in the British wool-
len industry (one of the best paid in the
kingdom) was 41s. lOd.; in Australia, 81s.
3d.; in the U.S.A., 98s. Bd., taking the dollar
at par. In 1923 the U.K. lost 256,284 people
by immigration (practically all of them work-
ers who did not propose to return), and the
U.S. 65,568, most of them rich trippers avlio
had every intention of returning. In the
same year the U.S. acquired 487,057 humans
from abroad, most of them workers; and
Britain received 57,606, at least 75 per cent,
of whom, it is safe to say, were wealthy birds
of passage eager to have a look at the ruins
and other sights of interest in the old country
and then hurry home again. Freetrade Bri-
tain is the only country in the world to-day
that is deliberately pushing its able-bodied
AAmrkcrs out, and protected America is the
only one that is, with equal vigor, prevent-
ing new workers from coming in. The Gov-
ernment of the one is in the plight of a be-
leaguered general who has to get rid of the
“useless mouths” to save his garrison from
starvation, that of the other in the pleasant
position of the commander of a crack corps
to which only the best type of soldier can
aspire. England was an immigrant country
once, the Mecca of every tradesman so skilled
that he could put a high price on his ser-
vices ; but that Avas before the doctrines of
the Manchester School as to the beneficence
of cheap imports had come to give foreign
nations an opportunity tp build up indus-
tries of their oavii behind tariffs. Nowadays
it is the skilled British artisans that have
to go abroad and the foreign ones that are
able to stay at home.
* * * »
In face of such facts it is absurd to claim
that Freetrade is doing England good as a
nation, except in the. sense that a drug bene-
fits an addict who is so far gone that he
Avould die if suddenly and entirely deprived
of his poison. There are classes, of course,
whose members will profit from the German
settlement. In the last year for which com-
plete figures are available the U.K. sold to
nine foreign countries coal to the value of
millions sterling—enough to pay for all
the bacon, beef, mutton, cocoa and coffee im-
ported during the preceding 12 months.
Workers connected with the coal industry
will score when the cheap products of the
German factories begin to pour into Eng-
land ; and they will earn more, since Germany
will again become a buyer of British coal.
Lancashire should profit, too. At present the
textile industry is suffering from the loss of
its old Central European customers. With
the re-appearance of Germany as a manu-
facturing power, Manchester will find a new
market for its wares. Not such a market
as it enjoyed 10, much less 20, years ago
but still a market of sorts, and one that
should last until the Germans are in a posi-
tion to make up their own softgoods. Per-
sons on small fixed incomes—the middle and
lower-middle classes—will be in clover until
such time as the increasing stream of cheap
goods from abroad begins to affect their in-
vestments or their jobs. It is absolutely cer-
tain that tins stage will be reached in time
as inevitable as the crisis which has to be
faced eventually by a drug-taker. Imperial
preference is an alternative, and there are
hopes that the U.K. may swalloiv that admit-
tedly unpleasant dose before it is too late
There are hundreds of lucrative industries
in which the Dominions, unlike the central
Luropean countries, are not in a position at
present to compete with British skill and
capital. It would pay us to help keep those
industries alive in Britain even at some sac-
rifice to ourselves. A point that no citizen of
Australia or its sister Dominion can afford
to overlook is that now, and maybe for gen-
erations to come, in proportion as Bri-
tain deteriorates in power and prestige the
Dominions will tend to do the same. The
Commonwealth is far less secure than it was
ten years ago, because in the interval Bri-
tain lias exchanged the two-power for a one-
power standard. Our security must decrease
with every defence cut that British Gov-
ernments are impelled to make because
of the growth of their unemployed pro-
blem, until a stage is reached when
—despite the brave words of our Chari-
ton,s and Ansteys about holding ou.r own bv
means of unarmed native valor—we shall
be an easy prey for the first land-hungry
I ower that decides to pick a quarrel with

of tins country is not x\sia but Freetrade.
SIX SUGAR-MILLS IN THE DISTANCE.
Britain does Australia the dubious compli-
ment of copying its worst failures in the way
of inventing and supplying work. The
method consists in putting men on to un-
skilled and mostly unproductive jobs, which
last a definite time and then come to a
definite end, and leave the problem where it
was, and the public debt much further ad-
vanced than it was. Jobs may last a long time
under a policy of judicious loafing, but they
must come to an end, and the only permanency
about them is the debt and the inculcation
ot loafing and unskilled habits. A factory,
even if it is a mere whisky mill, may make
its own way for a century when once set
going, and create capital for expansion as it
plods along; but that is a different matter,
At present £40,000,000 a year is being spent
on the making of roads. This is in an island
winch is only greater by the edge of a
shadow than Victoria, and which is largely
road already, save in some odd corners like
tne County of Sutherland, which are pure
and unadulterated scenery with a fringe of
fash. A further expenditure of £13,000,000
is mentioned. Philip Snowden, the Chan-
cellor, further stated that the Government
would “welcome a development of the canal
system, ' of which muddy waterwavs Britain
owns nearly 4000 miles already/ But the
making of canals is also a job with a definite
finish, and when made they don’t exactly pro-
duce wealth, though they help to shift it
about. Another statement was to the effect
that the railway companies might furnish
some temporary employment if they scrapped
their equipment arid provided themselves
with a new outfit; and it might be said with
truth that members of Parliament would do
an equally good service if they burned their
clothes and went naked to the tailor for a
new supply—naked and goosefieshed, but un-
ashamed. It might be by way of a hint of
pending nationalisation that the Labor Chan-
cellor lately referred to the fact that at
present railways have to “consider their
shareholders.” Apparently the Government,
when its time comes, will be free of any con-
sideration for its shareholders.
But even Philip Snowden, sanguine as
he is, has a dim suspicion that, man cannot
be saved by relief works alone. Wherefore
he made mention of one pathetic little scheme
for creating a new industry. Under certain
conditions, he said, he thought he saw the
way to the establishment of six beet-sugar
factories, to employ 3000 people all told.
The conditions were a subsidy of 19s. 9d. per
cwt., but “in order to safeguard Frcetrade
principles/ an excise duty of 9s. 9d. was
to. be levied. Unless *lll6 story has been
grievously mixed up in transmission, it is a
case of giving money with one hand and tak-
ing part of it back with the other. How that
moth-eaten Ark of the Covenant, Freetrade,
is to be safeguarded if local industry receives
a preference of £lO per ton is not easy to
understand; but under the proposed arrange-
ment this aid is to gradually disappear, and
at the end of 10 years is to vanish altogether
—probably along with the factories. The
employment of 3000 people when 1,500,000
are on the pauper list is no great thing; yet,
according to the cabled summary, this was
the only proposition on the list which wasn’t
relief work and of an obviously temporary
kind. At latest advices France had 90 per-
manent and self-supporting beet-sugar fac-
tories, employing over 20,000 people, and
the industry was then only getting on its feet
after the war. This makes the Snowden
scheme reminiscent of the lion which ate mice
in its old age, with a preference for old and
slow mice. The “safeguarding” of Freetrade
is, however, so important that the mere feed-
ing of the people must stand over.
Meantime the wonderful MaoShufflk
housing project, which was the big roof and
dome of the castle of dreams, is having the
poorest sort of luck. The original idea was
to build 2,500,000 houses at the rate of about
167,000 per year. They were to cost £SOO
each, and were to be let at 9s. per week,
including rates. That would mean, in very
many places, about ss. for rent, repairs, ulti-
mate replacement and bad debts, and 4s. for
rates. _ Unfortunately, the cost bolted far
past £SOO. It is alleged that the laying of
1000 bricks per man per day is not difficult,
but that the average rate in England now is
273. The allegation goes on to the effect that
the pace is much the same in other branches
of the building industry. The Government
doesn’t see its way to say or do anything to
its bricklaying supporters; but the Labor
Attorney-General has outlined a plan for
doing something strenuous to someone else.
The idea is to seize on all the places in which
building materials are made, and run them
under Government management. It is a Bol-
shevik method; and, though it is hardly
possible that a British Ministry would make
quite the mess that Moscow did, it is
probable that the amount saved in owners'
profits would be lost several times orw in
other ways. An earlier idea, which failed
to pass the Commons, was to confiscate the
house in which an unemployed lived; in other
words, to confiscate the rent and give him
the house gratis. The proposed seizure of
house-building materials reads like a milder
variation of the scheme. It is a time of
trouble, and Britain is a land of many ghosts;
and in the midst of it all the United States
has again tightened up its immigration laws,
so that that familiar and cheaply-attained


retreat for the distressed Briton, George
Washington’s republic of High Protection,
is to a great extent cut off. For ail these
and other woes the six beet-sugar mills in
the distance look like quite insufficient con-
solation.
THE BUILDERS.
Enormous buildings, whether of a public or
private nature, have always been the mark
of despotisms; and the measure of real free-
dom possessed by any nation of ancient times
may almost be gauged by the nature of the
ruins it has left behind. The mighty stones
of the Egyptian Pyramids seem to have been
set in place by the double force of religious
fear and the taskmaster’s whip. Athens, with
a milder system of slavery, built more lightly
and gracefully, but less enduringly. Ancient
Rome seems to have been content for the
most part with indifferent structures of brick
and lighter stone until the imperial age,
when slavery grew cheap and nasty, though
the Cloaca Maxima remains to attest the
nature of the very early Etruscan power in
the city. In far freer Gaul the towns were
large, open and built of materials that re-
quired renewal every second generation, while
Carthage, raised and founded on the lash,
had so much solidity of grandeur that its
ruins have furnished the material of a dozen
more recent cities. In England the Norman
despot shut himself in a huge stone castle of
unimagined filthiness, while the freedom-
loving Englishman erected his one-storeyed,
white-washed home of oak and clay. Free-
dom, in the last resort, went to the woods and
the leathern tent; tyranny in its fear of open
things cut its deep, dark dungeons in the
solid rock. The progress of liberty can be
traced in the great houses of every northern
land through the gradual change from heavy
battlemented walls and narrow windows to
lighter structures open to the sun and breeze.
Always the great builders and the great
lovers of free ways have been at opposite
poles in thought; and it would seem that
there is a real principle here pressing a
lance-point of natural human prejudice into
the very heart of modern economics.
To-day in New York and London—and to
a milder degree in Melbourne and Sydney—
there is a tyrannous force of accumulated
wealth expressing itself in great buildings;
but there is at the same time in most of
the countries of the world a serious shortage
of ordinary dwellings for the people. Modern
life is no longer content with a hovel;
modern health authorities can no longer
tolerate the disease-gathering dens into which
the lower workers of the world were once
forced. Yet the supply of houses possessing
some of the decencies of modern life is never
equal to the demand.
The shortage is due to many causes, but
on the facts recently made plain in England
the chief reason would appear to be the
growing unwillingness of men to enter the
building trades. In spite of Government
assistance, the builders have not found the
erection of small houses a profitable busi-
ness; but the turning factor in their con-
sideration is the want of certainty with re-
gard to the suply of skilled workmen. In
other words, there are not enough houses to
go round, because there are not enough skilled
tradesmen to go round. The distate for build-
ing as an occupation increases; the large
buildings, because they mean long jobs,
secure the first choice of workers; and it is
too risky to try to compete in any cheap
home-making scheme with only the services
of inferior tradesmen and odd-jobbers. So
there is a sense in which the dwellings of
the people are being sacrificed to the inter-
ests of huge construction and long contracts.
It is this aspect of the matter which justifies
the S. Australian Labor Government in
letting a contract for building homes a thou-
sand at a time.
But there is no proof whatever that
the supply of skilled labor will keep
up for another generation even for the
larger work. This aspect introduces a very
serious consideration which does not appear
to have been taken account of by any states-
man. The big buildings of to-day will re-
quire a good deal of attention to keep in
thorough repair—-which in the case of those
that overshadow city streets means in a con-
dition of safety. How long, at the present
rate of falling off, will the skilled workers
be found who can ride a high beam or do
their jobs from the loop of a steel cable? It
is true that the Pharos, which was 460 feet
high, stood from the third century b.c. to the
thirteenth century A.n. and must have been
unattended by men who understood the origi-
nal work for at least twelve hundred years.
But the Pharos was not perpendicular. The
outer walls of that great structure were
drawn in at. a considerable angle, the base
being very large indeed; so that its natural
security was infinitely greater than that of
modern steel-frame skyscrapers. It was, in
fact, probably regarded as indestructible by
its architect. Our new buildings have neither
its shape nor its quality; they require pro-
tection for their steel as well as for their
“skin” and their ornamental work; and it
is obvious that some matter as small as a
leaking roof might make them dangerous
within a generation. It follows clearly that
if the supply of skilled labor should fail, our
descendants would have to avoid them and
leave them to their own ruin.
But the shortage of ordinary dwellings is
an even more serious matter. In England
the Ramsay Macjjo nald Government pro-
poses to meet it by direct and large annual
expenditure over a long period of years, by
a dilution of skilled labor and by a. great;
easing up of apprenticeship regulations. It
is not plain that this will go far towards a
real solution of the problem. It looks more
like creating a number of jerry-built houses,
which on their original cost may prove a bad
investment for the nation. One scheme which
the future may be forced to adopt is the so-
called machine-made concrete house. By
using this much unskilled labor may be em-
ployed, when it is available, to replace the
work usually done by tradesmen. But in
such a connection the word “unskilled” is
misleading. The construction of such houses
could not be left to the usual odd-job men
nor to a gang of navvies. The work has all
the features which have made the building
Irades unpopular; and it is very question-
able indeed whether any large supply of half-
skilled labor could be permanently found to
carry it on.
Tf the objection to occupations of this
nature is fundamental among free nations
as history appears to show —civilisation will
be forced into new shapes. It is even pos-
sible that at some not very far distant date
the watchword of democracy may be “Every
man his own builder,” and that some new
pride of race may drive us back to the hut.
Meanwhile it appears as if some regulation
of the whole building trade might be neces-
sary which would guarantee that the first;
call upon the labor available should be that
of the home builder. When Mary Smith
requires a roof over her head the new bank
building and the picturc-“palace” might; rea-
sonably be asked to wait.
C. O. M.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Chance for the Churches.
It is understood that a majority of the Par-
liamentary Commission which recently in-
vestigated pony-racing in N. S. Wales favors
its abolition. If the recommendation is made
it should put an acid test on the bona fides
of the Christian churches as social reformers.
Let the R.C. Church apply to the prohibi-
tion of pony-racing a fraction of the energy
it periodically gives to forlorn-hope’ efforts
to get a State subsidy for its schools, and let
the Protestant churches attack the question
with half the zest they display when liquor
prohibition is under discussion, and the battle
for righteousness will be won before it has
properly started. The vested interests of
pony-racing have a perfect right to look for
support for their quasi-criminal business to
certain quarters. 11. L. Mencken, of
America, wrote recently about “the power
that mere words have over the minds of
men,” and he instanced slavery: we all hate
the idea of slavery, yet “an ordinary English-
man of our time is, on the whole, less free
than a Roman slave of the time of Hadrian.”
Racing is thought about along similar
muddled lines. Kings and princes are fond
of racing, and so it is patronised by Gover-
nors, and its assailants are liable to a charge
of subversiveness, if not disloyalty. Borne
thoroughbreds make valuable sires or dams,
and so all racing is desirable as a means of
improving the quality of tlie nation’s horse-
flesh. Borne owners—perhaps one in a hun-
dred in Australia —race for sport and no-
thing else, wherefore all racing is sport. And
so on. .Kings do not frequent pony meetings,
and in consequence the latter are shunned
by Governors; and not even its most infatu-
ated admirer contends seriously either that
pony-racing does anything for the breed of the
Australian horse or that its leading lights are
in it for anything but hard cash. Neverthe-
less it shares with horse-racing a moral and
social prestige reflected straight from the
Royal Enclosure at Ascot. Illogical to the
point of imbecility, of course, but tragically
true. This glamor has never deluded clear-
eyed observers of experience. They know
that pony-racing is one of the most fertile
sources of poverty and crime in the com-
munity. It is not the damage done to those
who are lured away from production work
on a couple of days a week all tlie year round
to add to the incomes of bookmakers on the
courses, but the drain the swindle represents
on the time, nerves and pockets of thousands
of wage-earners, male and female, who may
never have seen a racehorse in action. There
is hardly a big city firm without its pony-
bookmaker’s agent betting on commission
with employees of all grades and ages and
both sexes, and not a suburban business street
without a shop at which clients (usually
the wives of workers) are encouraged to take
short odds about non-triers. Here essentially
is a social cancer that the churches should
help to cut out. And it; lias the advantage
over alleged evils, such as Btate schools and
the drinking habit, of being operable. There
could be no sly pony-racing. Its total aboli-
tion might be completely and finally effected
once the necessary legislative authorisation
Avas given; and if only the churches threw
their combined weight into the struggle no
N. B. Wales Parliament would dare to resist
further the already strong public feeling
against the ruinous institution.

A Dead Lady in Mexico.
News of the slaying of a British subject
of U.S. birth comes from Mexico. Crimes and
outrages constitute almost the entire output
of that: country as filtered through tlie U.S.,
and it is possible that this arrangement will
continue until Uncle Bam is driven to a very
large interference in the cause of humanity,
and to lease all the stupendous oil deposits to
U.S. syndicates. After that a moral uplift
is expected. In fact, since the great oil
discoveries, Mexico has had about as much
chance of doing (in print) some action that
isn’t blank villainy as the Orange Free Btate
had after the great diamond discovery, or
the Transvaal after the gold finds. The
tale related about the deceased lady makes
her the widow of an English banker and
the owmer of a large estate. Many countries
don’t allow foreigners to oa\ t h estates, hut
Mexico can hardly do otherwise, owing to
pressure from the North. The first province
which it lost to the United States departed
some 80 years ago, the trouble being engi-
neered by U.S. settlers, and some GO years
ago a sort of tentative proposal was made to
a Mexican President that it would he a grace-
ful act if landowners from George Washing-
ton’s land were exempted from taxation. Tlie
country lias had for some years a law of the
kind very common in Australia providing for
the resumption of big estates for closer
settlement. Very probably too much of the
payment takes the form of Government
securities; and possibly this helped the latest
trouble. Anyhow, the lady appears to have
held herself superior to Mexican law, and
proceeded to defend her property. It is
variously alleged that her house was besieged
by Federal troops, that Federal troops set out
from the city of Mexico vowed to suspend
the lady by tlie neck, and that President
Obregon despatched troops with his personal
orders about the hanging. This makes the
matter look like a case for stern interven-
tion. Yet, strangely enough, Mrs. Evans is
said to have been shot while driving through
the streets of a little town with a bag of
money, the assassin or assassins promptly
fleeing with the bag; and the Federal troops,
so far from applauding the robbers and mur-
derers, appear to have promptly arrested and
executed them. Whether this will satisfy
the U.S.A. remains to be seen. It probably
won’t. A serious and recurrent difficulty in
M exico is to secure the “recognition” of the
great republic across the border. ’Phis is no
automatic business. Each new President (or
usurper) has to negotiate separately, and
generally buys his way with oil concessions.
As a rule, he has to exceed liis powers and
hurst the law into shivers before he can
grant enough to form a basis of negotiation.
Mexico has two possible kinds of ruler —the
good one who grants concessions to extrane-
ous capitalists and the bad one who doesn't.
The recent Carranza was a thick-headed
tyrant and a creation of the army, with no
legal standing whatever. But he promised
grants to foreign applicants galore, and was
“recognised” at Washington in great haste.
Ilis successor, Orkegon, belongs to a species
which has been rare in Mexico during recent
years, inasmuch as he stood for election, and
apparently the election was quite fair. But
his electoral campaign was a fierce denuncia-
tion of the whole foreign syndicate industry
interspersed with remarks about the validity
of many titles granted by rulers who had no
title themselves. He was enthusiastically
declared bogus at Washington; and if lie
didn’t personally slay Mrs. Evans there are
large financial and other interests in the
U.S.A. which are quite ready to ask the
world to believe that it was only because
one of his minions was a better shot.
A Short List of Objections.
British Prime .ui.-siet Ramsay Mac-
Shuffle promises to develop into one of the
big wild-cats of history, and lie lias invited
Australian Prime Minister Bruce to take a
sociable stroll on the housetops with him. If
Bruce refuses flatly lie will be an unpopular
man, yet flat refusal is the best thing that
could happen. Mac Shuffle is very anxious
to get rid of some of the population for
which lie can’t find employment unless lie
violates the sacred principles of Freetrade,
and apparently rather than do that lie would
see the whole nation in the workhouse, bar-
ring the aged person who would have to stay-
outside to bring imported victuals to the
inmates. Australia being a large place which
was never known to refuse a loan, Mac-
Shuffle’s eye naturally turned this way.
Hence this intimation
The draft agreements for the operation of the
new Empire migration proposals have been received.
The proposal is that to assist migration Great Britain
will lend tlie Commonwealth up to £34,000,000 for
land settlement and developmental work. The Com-
monwealth will in turn lend the money to the
States, which will administer its expenditure. Great
Britain and the Commonwealth will share the larger
part of the interest, charges, so that the States will
receive the money a nominal charge.
In this copious way does the British Prime
Minister hold out the right hand of fellow-
ship with a rainbow in it; and as he doubt-
less means well the refusal should he polite,
as well as firm. The objections are many and
large. To begin with, it is very uncertain
whether the States would receive any money.
Money doesn’t come here from the land of
that composite person Llewellyn Mcßull
—only goods which this country ought, to
make for itself. The fact that the Com-
monwealth would pay part of the interest
on behalf of the States would make things
up better than if the States paid on be-
half of the Commonwealth. The same people
pay—or owe. Still, the idea of the Com-
monwealth borrowing on behalf of the States
and endorsing their lOTJ is a redeem-
ing feature, and the only one. There is a
chance of the two sets of finances becoming
so tangled that one day the State debts and
borrowing powers will lapse into the hands of
the central authority by a process of gravi-
tation. after the simple fashion of a drunkard
subsiding on a doorstep. Next, though the
interest rate may be low now it may he
darned high on renewal day. And the tax-
payer will doubtless have to find much or all
of it, because “developmental works” have a
habit of earning no interest on their cost, and
of presenting a fearsome annual hill for ex-
penses. N. S. Wales, for instance, lvas rail-
ways whose net earnings are £lOOO per mile
per annum less than nothing. This country
owed, at June, 1923. more than £53,000,000
under the single heading of “Land purchased
for settlement,” and the results have been so
disappointing that it is best for it to owe no
more, until it finds out what is wrong with
the whole business. Finally, it is neither
dignified nor decent to do anything that
might seem like joining the already too great
bread line at the Old Man's door; and it
would look a rather graceless business to be
too particular about the quality of the per-
sons offering after being not in the least
particular about the money offering. Other
objections to the fascinating project might
be quoted, but these few constitute some-
thing to begin with, and amount to a pre-
liminary skirmish, so to speak.
The Crimes-of-Violence Wave.
The community would be staggered if it
were possible to present it with an approxi-
mately correct estimate of what it is losing
in wealth and happiness, and in national effi-
ciency, by crime. Not the minor forms of
misbehavior against which the police direct
most of their activities, but offences result-
ing often in the death or disablement of the
victims. The English-speaking world is
soberer and less quarrelsome than it was
half a century ago, but as regards the
Satanic offences that periodically send a
chill down humanity’s spine, the change has
been for the worse. A study of the Mel-
bourne papers of the past few years, for
example, is calculated to make the elderly
sigh for the days when a Deeming, a Peace
or a Palmer was regarded as a phenomenon
in cold-blooded ferocity. The two American
boys who have just owned up to the murder
of one of their small friends in revolting
circumstances are types that this country
possesses in alarming numbers —animals who
do not even possess that faculty for being
worried over their kills which brought so
many of the old-time assassins (Neill
Cream, for example) to the gallows. These
ghoulish creatures are really being encour-
aged in Australia. No steps are taken offi-
cially to identify them before they break
loose, though in the case of some, such as
the Gun-alley murderer, their predilections
may have been known for years ; and while
our machinery for the prevention of crime
is bad, that for the detection of it is, if any-
thing. worse. The sole defence of the two
American lads is that they are congenital
criminals, and that many of those associated
with them have known it for years. It is
quite likely. The mental defective who when
annoyed thinks only of murder, and when
attracted by a woman or child determines
to ravish her, is easily diagnosed. Under our
system, however, he has, in a manner of
speaking, the dog’s privilege of a first bite;
and if the effects are not fatal, or if he can
square or deceive a jury, he will in the one
event be released after a short term in gaol,
and in the other go scot-free. Most of the
murders, discovered and undiscovered, that
have horrified Melbourne and Sydney of late
could have been prevented by more police,
and all might have been cleared up by
brainier police. But in these cities the brawn
of the force is occupied largely in raiding fan-
tan and two-up schools and attending to cleri-
cal and ceremonial duties ; and, while strong
in character, physique and deportment, the
members are nowhere remarkable for intel-
lect or originality. Police are needed most to
deal with crime—real crime. For this pur-
pose a detective, staff possessing solid mental
and educational qualifications is required.
The pay should be good, and neither age nor
physical disability a bar. As between an
elderly psychiatrist with a natural taste for
crime-investigation on one side and a young
ex-policeman with no qualities in particular
but courage and strength on the other, the
choice should nearly always fall upon the
former. And it would help him and his col-
leagues and make for safety if, once they
had convinced themselves that a given crimi-
nal was morally hopeless, they could—with
whatever safeguards against injustice Par-
liament thought fit —get him committed to
an asylum. The other sort of policeman
is required exclusively for work on the
streets, in and out of uniform.

The N. S. Wales Lower Courts.
“Frrz w illiam” after long experience :—-
A point that seems to have been overlooked or
evaded during the debate on the amending N. S. Wales
Crimes Bill is the question of the appointment and
qualifications of the magistrates to whom the en-
larged powers are to be entrusted. In practice a
police or stipendiary magistrate is a promoted
C.P.S. who has passed “the P.M.’s examination”;
and if there is one thing worse than making a civil
servant a magistrate, it is the testing of his qualifi-
cations by examination.
It is, of course, an old jest in N. S. Wales that
“police magistrates” should be called “magisterial
police.” The trouble seems to be practically un-
avoidable under our system. The C.P.S. is in con-
stant touch with the police, is part of the same
administrative system, and inevitably absorbs what
“Taylor on Evidence” calls the natural creed of the
policeman, that all men are guilty until they are
proved innocent. He doesn’t change his spots when
he goes on the bench. When he gets there practi-
cally every prosecution before him is conducted by
policemen, and policemen are the chief witnesses for
the prosecution. The present Judge Edwards some
years ago, in tiis “Justices’ Duties,” said: “The
police are undoubtedly an honest body of men, but
their evidence should always be scrutinised with the
greatest care. A constable gives evidence so fre-
quently in the course of his duties that he becomes
an expert in the giving of evidence: he uses the
same phrases so often that he comes after a time
to use them without fully weighing their import-
ance or meaning. He nearly always has a direct
personal interest in the case. If he has arrested a
person on a certain charge, he feels bound to support
that charge; if he does not, he is apt to get into
trouble with his superiors for arresting a person
upon insufficient grounds.” Nevertheless, anybody
who is familiar with the course of business in our
police-courts will bear me out in saying that in most
cases the constable’s evidence is accepted as in-
fallible. Some day I will endeavor to work out
a formula showing how many lay witnesses it takes
to outswear a. constable. I suspect it is about five
to one, but it may be more. It varies, of course,
with the magistrate.
As regards the examination test, it may be the
path of least resistance, but 1 asseverate, and will
maintain under torture, that an examination is not
the proper way of discovering a man’s qualifications
for the Bench. I suppose that f lic ideal Judge is a man
who to a sound practical knowledge of the law adds
De Profundis:
THE CRY OF BLACK BROTHER OF THE NORTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Equal in Christ ! And yet I walk afraid
In secret places, lest a hand be laid
Upon my neck, and ye compel my ways.
I, who have owned this earth, this sky, this
sea,
Have so much earth and air allotted me,
Made to walk humble all my shadowed days,
Wear tawdry clothes, eat of the meanest fare,
With Freedom gone and heart filled with
despair!
Torn from my side, my weeping children die.
My old men in the jungle hidden lie;
Hunted and manacled my young men go
And come no more. In misery and woe
My women for thy sins are doomed to death.
Thou art not punished, thou the guilty one!
Let the law take the thing thou gavest
breath!
What matters a black mother —half-caste
son?
Stone, stone tlie pair—they have no part
in tliee—
And God, thy God, is deaf eternally!
You promised bread, hut gave me stones
to eat.
You hang the leg-irons o’er the bleeding feet;
Revolver fire makes aged limbs obey
And thin shanks hurry on the hated way.
You crack tlie whip! The pearl ship on the
sea—-
Where black men work and others draw
their pay—
Is witness of our helpless misery.
Dive deep, dive long, or else no food to-day!
Water, free water, does not run in ships
That gather shell. Laugh at his parched
lips!
Like a lone cedar oil the hills I stand:
My leaves torn off have littered all the sand :
My shoots transplanted in their anguish die;
My boughs are naked to the pitiless sky.
Hew at the roots! Cut at the heart of me!
Dumb, hound and helpless, who will say
ye nay?
Pass by, pass by—scribe, priest and
pharisee—
Kneel at the corners of the street and pray,
Or watch me curiously as here I die—
Only a black man, a poor nigger I!

SYDNEY IN THE SPRING.
Sydney in September is unique—but “The Australia” is unique in its appeal
in every season of the year.
The individuality of this great hotel in its atmosphere, appointments, service and

of tariff.
Reservations should be made now for the Spring Meeting, commencing 4th October.

an equally practical knowledge of men and affairs.
Our system aims at neither. No amount of examina-
tion lore will make up the lack of practice, and no
one whose daily work keeps him in constant associa-
tion with specialists on the seamy side is likely to
have the other qualification. The English system
of appointing S.M.’s. from practising barristers of
seven years’ standing has more to commend it. The
barrister has a practical knowledge of the law that
the mere examinee lacks, and, though he may be a
specialist, he has from the nature of his work a wider
outlook than that of the man who looks at life
from behind a Government counter.
However, our civil service has a political pull, and
it is not likely that we shall get any alteration in a
system that provides comfortable billets for men with
the faculty of passing moderately easy examinations.
All the same, I have doubts about the expediency
of enlarging their powers. One fairly certain result
of the change will be that the Judges at Quarter
Sessions are going to be kept busy with appeals.
And as it is usually easier to appeal from a Court
that decides a mixed question of law and fact than
from one in which the law and the facts are dis-
tinguished, I foresee that the Court of Criminal
Appeal will get its share. Appeal upon appeal until
the client and his friends are drained dry—it is a
vista that makes a middle-aged lawyer rub his lower
chest! We didn’t have these chances in my young
days, when the festive sheep-stealer rolled up before
a jury of his peers, and was naturally and promptly
acquitted—-it was almost too easy. Now the fight
—and the corresponding outlay—will be both grim
and great.

An Income-tax Comedy.
From a man in the business:—
I remember when I first met that second schedule
relating to • the Federal taxation of income from
property: “For such part of the taxable income as
exceeds £2OOO but does not exceed £6500, the
additional tax for each additional pound of taxable
income above £2OOO shall increase continuously
with the increase of the taxable income in a curve
of the third degree in such a manner that the
increase of tax for one pound increase of taxable
income shall be 33.6 pence at a taxable income of
£2000,” etc.
I read it through at least a dozen times in a
vain endeavor to understand it. I confess that I
even read it backwards.
Determined to find out what it all meant, T
consulted an official, who asked if I had any know-
ledge of mathematics. Assuming as mathematical a
look as I possibly could on such short notice, I told
him that I was perhaps not in the first flight as a
mathematician, but that in my schooldays I had
chased the elusive x a fair distance. I hastened to
assure him that my income from property was not
£2OOO, but that I would like to see an example
worked out on that basis.
“First of all,” said the specialist, “we must have
an argument.”
“No, no,” I interposed quickly, “no argument,
1 bog.”
“You misunderstand me,” he smiled. “I meant
an argument in its mathematical sense. I would
suggest that it be the taxpayer’s income expressed
in units of £lOOO. If we wish to calculate the
rate of income-tax on £2OOO we use the number
2, on £3OOO the number 3, and so on.”
“In what way?” I queried.
“Here” —tossing me pencil and paper—“follow me
carefully. Put down the number you choose, double
it, subtract the result from 64, multiply by the
number, subtract the result from 755, multiply
again by the number, then divide 332 by the num-
ber and add the quotient to what you have already
got. divide by 60, and subtract 5. The answer will
be the rate of the tax in pence per pound. How
much have you got?”
“Seven million six hundred thousand,” I began:
but he invited me to go over my figures again.
“Ah, yes,” I said, after another painful period of
arithmetical gymnastics, “the answer is 18.9333
pence.”
“Right,” said the expert; “that is the rate for
£2OOO according to the schedule. The rate at.
present in force is 531 p.c. higher.”
“But how can it be right,” I protested, “when
it says that the increase of the tax shall be 33.6
pence at £2000?”
“Ah,” he explained, “that is merely the tangent
at that particular point of the curve. To obtain
that result you multiply the formula by the original
number, and differentiate. You are acquainted with
the Differential Calculus, of course?”
I went down for the full count; and when I
woke I wondered how many members of the Federal
Parliament—or of the Ministry, for that matter —
had the faintest idea of the size of the tax they
were imposing on Australia.

The decision of Justice James in the Hotel
Australia and Usher’s Hotel cases last week
rectified an idiotic, not to say pernicious,
situation. In the Australia case one Blyth
took a room, and, after entertaining his
friends, slept in it. Campbell Jones took
a room at Usher’s and gave a dinner, but
did not use the room. Clearly if the Aus-
tralia licensee had refused liquor to Mr.
Blyth after 6 p.m. on the day of his arri-
val, he would have had to do' the same by
every new guest until the latter had by
some unspecified means established his
genuineness; nor was the plight of the Carl-
con manager any different in fact. He was
not to know when drink was supplied to
the Campbell Jones party that the giver
of the feast did not mean to sleep in the
room he had booked. The position, then, is
that two classes can safely be supplied with
alcohol after hours in hotels: those who are
dining with one who has booked-in for the
night (in other words, one who is rich enough
not to worry about throwing away the cost
of a room) and those who are in company
with a Cabinet Minister. (It lias already
been established that summonses will be With-
drawn against hotels that have supplied
liquor to friends of Ministers, as they were
withdrawn in the matter of the raided book-
makers.) But it is inequitable that anyone
should not be allowed to have liquor with
his meals on licensed premises in view of the
fact that anyone can have all the alcohol he
likes after 6 in unlicensed restaurants. The
remedy, as The Bulletin has already
pointed out, is a dinner license, which would
provide a handsome addition to the revenue
and remove an anomaly which still exists,
despite last week’s judgment—the placing of
a premium on unlicensed restaurants for
dinner-giving purposes.

Dear Bulletin, — In confirmation of the
view that Australia need not look to the
United States for help in time of trouble, an
enclosed list of passes in a Los Angeles school
gives a fair idea of the type of hybrid which
is rapidly supplanting, or at any rate dilut-
ing, the Anglo-Saxon strain. The list shows
that of 75 names 10 are probably of British
WAITING; OR THE DOGS WHO KNEW THE FABLE.
origin. This hybridisation of the States is
proceeding all over the country, and we
should recognise that a new people is evolv-
ing out of the babel of nationalities. Those
who stay at home do not understand how
little the people of America know or care
about Australia. When the first news
flashed round the world about the wonderful
Australian soldier, we were “put on the
map” for a year or two; but that happened
nearly 10 years ago, and the new generation
of hybrids that have matured in America
have hardly heard of Australia. We have
heard a great deal lately of the outcry in
California about the Japanese; but those of
us who have been in that vociferous State
do not believe that a people who continue to
employ the Japanese in all their private
houses and hotels and restaurants can be
in earnest. Further, Jap labor having been
stopped, they are now importing black Fili-
pino labor. If you go to Honolulu you will
find a worse state of affairs; the planter,
having lost his supply of Japanese coolies,
is importing Porto Rican negroes. How
can we expect a people to come to the defence
of this country and its White Australia
policy who have no “white” instinct. There
are, of course, a proportion of people of the
type of that very fine man, the late Walter
Page ; but, alas, a very few years will see
that strain submerged. The intellectual
section of America is friendly to the British,
but a subtle propaganda throughout the coun-
try is at work. Wg should realise this, so
that we shall no longer fool ourselves with the
belief that the American people are one with
us, of the same blood and tradition. Yours,

From Ireland, where everything either goes
wrong or stands on its head by way of amuse-
ment, two events were recently reported. One
was the release of De Valera, who has been
“interned” so long that he was almost for-
gotten. There was no special reason for his
release save that he could hardly be kepi:
under lock and key for ever. The other event
was that the judicial end of the Privy Coun-
cil really proceeded to consider whether a
Commission can begin to make a new boun-
dary between the Irish Free State and the
six counties which form the North-Eastern
Colony, despite the fact that the Belfast
Government has sent no representative under
the Act of Lloyd George. As that unspeak-
able blunderer or double-dealer didn’t make
it compulsory for Belfast to appoint its Com-
missioner for 10,000 years or more, any pro-
ceedings are bound to create excitement, and
as De Valera has cheerfully nailed his Re-
publican banner to the mast again the excite-
ment should be intensified. Wherefore it
looks as if that stormy gentleman ought to
have been kept in a trifle longer, or the legal
proceedings ought to have been got over
earlier. But, then, Irish events mostly happen
at the wrong time, or to the wrong person.

“O. McKay M.”: Social workers in Mel-
bourne are asking support for a projected
slum settlement on the lines of institutions in
the big cities of England and the U.S.A. The
Anglican reverend Nicholls, who holds the
Fitzroy outpost for the church militant, is
behind the scheme, and Prof. Alexander
Gunn, the Uni.’s energetic Director of
Tutorial Classes and extension work, is be-
hind him. The idea is to establish a resi-
dential hostel in the midst of the slum area,
where University men and women may tackle
social problems and evils —prostitution, un-
employment, and so on—at the same time
working for the mental, moral, physical and
spiritual welfare of the submerged tenth. It
is a big order, but the advocates of the settle-
ment point to places like Toynbee Hall, in
London, where the design has been put into
execution, to the inestimable benefit of the
community. Incidentally, the student of
sociology is going to have an opportunity of
investigating his subject at first hand, and
of applying his knowledge in a practical way,
while the settlement will do for the slum-
denizens what the Workers’ Educational Asso-
ciation is doing for the artisan in healthier
surroundings. Rev. Nicholls has already
begun his mission of light—he is the very
active vicar of St. Mark’s—but he thinks
there is work enough for a crowd, and is
anxious to enlist the aid of the University in
particular and of the public in general. We
need a little social idealism, too.

“Nimsiii” : Dunwich (Q.), originally in-
tended as a Retreat for the Aged, has lat-
terly taken on a more comprehensive char-
acter; it has now become a dumping-ground
for all cases which the Government finds
a difficulty in bestowing or accommodating
elsewhere. Many of these cases are badly
served by this concession to expediency. The
island, owing to excessive dampness, cannot
be termed an ideal location for consumptives.
Yet it houses 25 of these unfortunates. The
cancer cases, numerically about as strong,
would surely fare better in the Diamantina
Hospital for Incurables. One cannot cavil
so much at the inclusion of about the same
number of inebriates, though it is significant
that the laissez-faire attitude adopted to-
wards these is yielding poor results. But
there are in addition at Dunwich lunatics
and imbeciles; and, lastly, a gang of non-
descripts, ex-gaolbirds and loafers, who, hav-
ing exhausted the patience of the civic autho-
rities, found the latter willing enough to
provide them with free quarters. All these,
and, most illogieally of all, the last-mentioned
batch, clutter up the place to the exclusion
of the genuine out-backer crippled by years
and toil, who frequently has to wait months
before an ear is inclined to his valid claim
to admission.

Dear Bulletin, —Just as our political re-
presentatives have failed in their duties to
the people, especially in the matter of evev-
mounting loans and public debts, so has the
resentment toward them strengthened the
hands of that section of the public which is
in permanent opposition to them, viz., the
industrial Communists and others of that
kidney. The anti-defence movement through-
out Australia to-day is one more certain
indication of the rising tide of Communism
and what it stands for, one further sure
sign of the general fed-upness of the nation
toward certain institutions which are now
suspected of having betrayed it. In the dis-
trict where I live, for instance, which is
supposed to be one of the wealthiest in Aus-
tralia, if not in the world —the immensely
rich wool-growing belt of Central Queens-
land —the squatters, but more particularly
the wealthy pastoral companies, with greater
leasehold areas than they know what to do
with, have shown up rather badly in the
matter of repatriating ex-soldiei’s to these
lands. These rich pastoral areas yielded a
high percentage of men to the battle-fronts
in the Great War —not perhaps the squat-
ters themselves, but wage-earners in the in-
dustry. Some of the finest fighting material
Australia sent overseas in the Great War
came from the pastoral regions of Western
Queensland; yet if one travels through those
districts to-day the small percentage of ex-
soldiers to be met with in occupation of
sheep land is a striking feature of those
areas. This is another of those things that
carry their own penalties.—Yours, etc., 7PN.

“Bildad” : The Irish Free State, which
about matches Tasmania for size, drafted its
Constitution on generous lines, and does itself
well. Its Parliament consists of 213 paid
members, whereas our Commonwealth gets
on with 111. There are 11 Ministers, and
the smallest salary is £l7OO. There is a High
Commissioner, but how high he may he
is not certain yet. The Governor-General
gets £lO,OOO per annum. The Senators are
to retire at the rate of 25 per cent, every
three years, so that after three elections
they will settle down to enjoy 12-year terms.
When a Senate election is on it will be
no open event. Parliament will nominate a
list of candidates, who must be at least 35
years old, and the common herd may choose
from these and no others. Presumably the re-
tiring gentlemen will be on the list. Per-
haps they will be the only gentlemen on
the list. The first and existing Senate was
created without even a pretence of popular
election, yet it is in for the full term. In
its first year the Minister of Finance
reckoned on spending £28,000,000 of revenue
and about £3,400,000 “to be found by borrow-
ing or otherwise.” In his second year he
proposed to spend £26,100,000 of revenue
(taxation was reduced), and some
£20,600,000 raised by “borrowing or other-
wise.” Presumably it will be all borrowing,
for “otherwise” is a broken reed. The pace
of expenditure is now at the rate of some-
thing like £l5 per head per year, which is
fairly brisk, seeing that the Free State
doesn’t appear to have adjusted its old debt
obligations and begun to pay interest on
them yet. It suggests the days of a century
ago, when the Green Isle was dancing its
way towards the Encumbered Estates Court.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Pleading that his Government’s sole desire
was to get on with its job, Earle Page in-
duced the N.S.W. Farmers and Settlers'
Conference to endorse his election agreement
with Bruce. The doctor is still popular
with the Ma State Agrarians, so much so
that the delegates refrained from reminding
him of his comparatively recent enthusiasm
for Country-party representation in the Sen-
ate. That Chamber contains no straight-out
Agrarian, unless Wilson, the Hon. Minister
from South Aus., may be so described, and
Wilson seems to have a foot in each allied
camp. If the pact goes through the Cockies
will bind themselves next year to support
the retiring Nationalist Senators in West-
ralia (Pearce, Lynch and Drake-Brockman),
Victoria (Elliott, Guthrie and Russell),
Queensland (Givens, Glasgow and Thomp-
son) and Tasmania (Payne, Foster, Hayes
and Millen) ; but this is a point that the
doctor has omitted to mention.
Defending his Government’s 44-liour week
policy, Collier, the Westralian Labor Pre-
mier, maintained that “men will produce as
much in 44 hours as in 48 hours, and in
many cases more.” With just as much
show of reason it might be contended that
men will produce more in 40 hours than
in 44, more again in 36 than in 40, still
more in 32 than in 36. Collier is too intelli-
gent not to know that this is rubbish. Un-
fortunately he is one of those Labor politi-
cians who would rather talk rubbish and
be popular for the moment than tell the plain
truth and be unpopular.
The N.S.W. Labor 'Council, which is
steered by Garden, passed this brisk resolu-
tion on a recent day
That the secretary circularise all Federal and State
members of Parliament, asking their opinion regard-
ing the repudiation of debt for the building of
cruisers if built oversea, in the event of their being
returned to power at next election.
And how does the N.S.W. Labor Council
think it could pick out the particular bond-
holders who furnished the particular coin or
notes which paid for any particular item
such as a cruiser? It may yet be found
necessary to make incitement to repudiation
a crime, like incitement to any other form
of robbery, and also a disqualification for
political activity in any form. The matter
is much more important than compulsory
voting.
A treaty has at last been made, or partly
made, between Britain and the Soviet; but
so far it looks rather rocky. Three commis-
sioners from each side are to meet and con-
sider how much British subjects lost in the
great confiscation. If they agree they will
proceed to consider payment, it being admit-
ted in advance that Russia can’t pay much,
though why it should be admitted is hard
to say. Then the question of handing over
a coin or two will remain, and it should be
a pretty long job, especially as the Soviet
reserves the right to make counter-claims.
But as soon as the bargain is signed the Brit-
ish Government is to ask Parliament to guar-
antee a loan for the big, insolvent, unrepen-
tant debtor, and that is prompt enough. Pre-
sumably all this is part of a struggle to cap-
ture the Russian market, but it would be
simpler if .T. Bull put on a robust tariff and
captured his own market.
“Old Parliamentary Hand’s” idea:—
The Prendergast Ministry (Vic.), knowing that it
can’t last without an election, is busy buying support
or promising to buy it when the money is available.
Every deputation is made a hoarding, every interview
a signboard for advertising the things Labor will do
“if it is permitted to go on.” To carry out what has
already been promised or foreshadowed would require
about twice as many millions of loan money as can
be got. It is all done so adroitly, too. Ministers
play up to the pet prejudice of every section that
interviews them, and they are being rushed with
deputations. What Prendergast will come a cropper
over is not yet certain, but it may be the reinstate-
ment of the police strikers. It was the composite
Ministry that sacked the strikers, and its Public
Safety Preservation Bill was supported by all the
non-Labor groups. Much as the Liberal cave dislikes
Lawson and Peacock, it will hardly dare to vote for
restoring the strikers to their old jobs, and so may
come the crash.
Thus early in its bright career, the new
Westralian Labor Government has had to
dig into the revenue from taxation to meet
the losses on the P’ertli tramways which the
party “nationalised” in 1913. Apropos, the
Queensland Labor Government, which re-
cently “nationalised” the Brisbane tram-
ways for £1,400,000, has been informed that
the system is tragically short of cars, etc.,
and that there will have to be a lavish ex-
penditure on extensions, none having been
built for five years—in fact, there have been
only four miles of new line in ten years.
A strike has already occurred on the con-
struction works, and a “regulation” stoppage
is threatened by the carmen, who have
claimed increased wages amounting to
£87,000 p.a. and have been granted addi-
tional Sunday pay. “Nationalisation” of
tramways is a splendid thing for the seller
when the buyer is a Labor Government.
The Queensland A.L.P. executive has
sprung to the Theodore Government’s de-
fence with a statement that the financial
situation won’t admit of the civil servants
being paid the 5 p.c. p.a. of which they were
docked in 1922, or of the basic wage being
restored to £4 os. p.w. The civil servants
have been making as much noise as the men
on the railways and tramways; their de-
mands for increased salaries and reduced
THE PARTY SEES AW.
LITTLE AUSTRALIA (to Stewart): “Yes, you don't think much of some of those on Bruce's
end; hut the question just now is, ‘Do you think more of those on Charlton's?”
hours have baited McCormack, the Minister
of Lands, into declaring that he would rather
quit Parliament than “improve the condi-
tion of a privileged class to the detriment of
the rest of the community.” In the midst
of all this excitement, one Hanson, who was
selected to hold new Agent-General Huxham’s
seat, has been looking careworn. Huxham’s
majority in Buranda was generally 600 or
700 in a poll of 6000 or thereabouts, but if
the Government-employee vote goes against
Labor Hanson will have to return to
plumbing.
“The defendant beat the horse over the
head and on the ribs with a heavy pole
chain ; the animal was very wet with sweat,
and was trembling.” Such evidence and
worse is given frequently in the Melbourne
police courts, and the penalty is nearly
always nominal. There is a distinct con-
nection between this phenomenon and the
sadistic attacks on human beings for which
the Vic. capital is becoming notorious. It
is easy to laugh at concern for animals as
mawkish sentimentality. The Southern
European races have been diverted for years
at the lengths to which the English go, and
the derisive sentiments of the Portuguese,
Spaniards and Italians were voiced by the
cowboys who appeared before a London court
last month in connection with the Wembley
Rodeo trouble. Yet that the English conven-
tion is good is more or less proved by the
fact that in the Southern European coun-
tries and in the Western States of America
the murder rate is from four to seven times
higher than it is in England. It is signi-
cant, too, that Melbourne is the only Com-
monwealth city that hankers for a rodeo.
Hobart Mercury demands that the Speck's
new Governor shall be an English or Scotch
gentleman who has the confidence of the
King, and is of the same religious persuasion,
or words to that effect. Which seems merely
an oblique way of intimating that in the
Murk’s opinion a Labor member named
O’Grady would not be a fit and proper per-
son to represent the Crown and Dignity.
There have been R.C. Governors in Ups.
aforetime —Gormanston was one—and no
protest was made by the Tory or Liberal or
Labor organs of the day, nor did the fires
of Smitlifield break out on the banks of the
Derwent. But “Gormy” owned a title and
estates (in Ireland) and O’Grady doesn’t.
These things make a difference.
The annual prize for incapacity and lack of
resource has again been allotted to Australia
for its management of the Northern Territory.
The total direct oversea trade for the year
to June, 1924, was £20,810, of which imports,
mostly for civil servants, _ accounted for
nearly two-tliirds, exports being a little over
£7OOO. When the A.W.U. became an in-
dustrial law unto itself in the N.T., it
was understood that the Possession was to be
a shining example of unionism. It was so
shining that there are only 72 unionists left.
The N.S.W. coke-workers are progressing
briskly with the third dispute of the year,
and as the first one lasted four months it
has been pretty well all dispute. The new
row is over a solitary coker who wasn’t re-
engaged after the old row. The Bulletin
foresees a general strike one of these days
because Smith isn’t re-engfjged as Premier
or member after the election. Meanwhile
the usual number of coal-mines are closed as
a matter of course. Last year 76,321 people
in the Commonwealth were out of work at
some time or other through industrial dis-
putes—6o.l99 in N.S.W. and 16,122 in the
other States. Somebody will begin to ask
presently how many strikes are due to our
elaborate machinery to prevent them.
The A-W.U. stood solidly behind Queens-
land Premier Theodore in his struggle with
the militants of the industrial and political
wings over the 44-liour week, and it pro-
mises to be a big factor in the Herbert pre-
selection, where the fight will be renewed.
There is a powerful foreign vote in the Her-
bert, and if Theodore can get even 50 p.e.
of it he will win. This vote is not militant,
and Theodore probably reckoned on it when
he considered plebiscite possibilities. Union-
istically, it is fairly well organised. The
A.W.U. sa-w to that when it engaged an
additional organiser who could make him-
self understood in Italian. Eihelly is a cer-
tainty for the Brisbane pre-selection. He
is popular with union officials and Labor
“stalwarts” generally, and the fact that he
has fallen out with the Premier over the
Agency-General and the London loan settle-
ment isn’t hurting him a bit.
The Sydney “stunt” press was much per-
turbed last week about certain proposals in
the N.S.W. Divorce Bill. Their smug
argument was that the publication of evi-
dence often “materially assisted in the
administration of justice”; and one or two
cases were cited in which publicity had de-
feated those guilty of collusion. But almost
every day citizens are being tried on serious
criminal' charges and not being given any
notice whatever by the press. The sole test
applied to either divorce suit or crime is:
“Has it any news-value?” Cases of con-
spiracy and blackmail often have none, and
so they arc relegated to oblivion; but brutal
murders make good reading, so they are
starred, even where, as in a recent Sydney
case, the murderer has confessed. The tests
applied in divorce are (1) salacity and (2)
the social or financial status _of the parties.
In either case publication of intimate; details
does nothing to assist justice; on the other
hand, it tends to keep self-respecting people
out of Court and away from their legal
remedies.
When the Vic. Labor Government had a
chance to appoint a member of the Railway-
men’s Union as third Commissioner, it
preferred Molomby, general superintendent of
transportation. Before the order-in-council
elevating Molomby was through, the Y.It.U.
bounced in on Hogan, Minister of Railways,
and asked for a fourth Commissioner to re-
present the rank and file. Thankful that
the deputation hadn’t come a few days
sooner, Hogan applauded the suggestion,
knowing full well that Parliament would
have to sanction it first and that there isn’t
Buckley’s chance of its doing so at present.
And so the game goes on.
Taking advantage of the crime wave in
Melbourne, A.L.P. branches are clamoring
for the re-employment of the policemen
sacked by Lawson and co. after the strike.
Labor Ministers would like to oblige, but
their hands are tied by promises made to
Lawson and Peacock when they were bar-
gaining for supply and five weeks’ adjourn-
ment, and there is the Glenelg by-election to
think of. Of the 630 strikers about 420
want to get back to their old jobs, with
seniority and pensions tacked on. Their re-
instatement would cost £136,000 a year for
pay alone, but that wouldn’t deter Prender-
gast if there weren’t Glenelg and other things
to consider.
In its ostentatious avoidance of sham
and tinsel the British Labor Government
makes itself ridiculous. Until the other day
treaties were made in the name of George
for whoever he might be), Emperor of India
and King of all the rest of the show. The
extent to which he was, or was not, in a
position to speak for the whole show the
other party might discover for himself. The
newest treaty leaves out the handy form of
speech, and is between “Great Britain and
Northern Ireland on one hand and the union
of Soviet and Socialist Republics on the
other.” Great Britain and Northern Ireland
fail by a long way to equal the area of
Maoriland, so the Empire wears a shrunken
aspect.
Queensland Premier Theodore resigned the
other day over the proposed 44-hours maxi-
mum week (resigned informally to the caucus
—not formally to the Governor, which would
have been serious), and Collins held the
leadership for an hour or so while his pre-
decessor walked round the block. Then Theo.
came back and resumed office. Probably the
incident left Collins a bitter man, for he
fell on his chief in the House at the next
opportunity for having made good terms
with the London financiers over the great re-
newal loan, and denounced his “surrender.”
It would have been better, said the passionate
pilgrim from Bowen, “for the State to pay
a higher rate of interest in New York and be
independent.” There is a touch of the
grotesque about the idea of any State which
owes a fearsome amount and has bills not
provided for falling due from day to day
being independent. No reason exists why it
shouldn’t be incoherent, or intoxicated, or
even insolvent, but independence is out of
the question.
These chatty people in N.S.W. whose new
“slogan” is “Good Roads r. Bad Railways”
have been cheered with the news that the
Penritli-Mount Victoria highway has gone to
the dogs again and requires £BO,OOO to pre-
vent it ceasing to be a road. Now that motor
drays emulate the size of trains, the effect
is much the same as if the rails were taken
off the railway and the train scooted gaily
on the ballast. No matter how good the
roadbed was. a new permanent way would
be wanted after each train passed, and that
seems likely to be the case with any network
of roads which Australia’s skimpy population
can buy and maintain, unless the hulking
variety of traffic is ordered to quit. There
are said to be four layers of debt on some
highways, including three repairing debts.
The railway at least makes an effort to pay
its own repair bill.

“Dido” : At East St. Ivilda the other night
a man foolishly stopped a woman after dusk
to ask to be directed to the house of a friend.
Before he could finish his opening sentence
he was violently assaulted on the crown of
the head with the butt-end of a formidable
brolly. The third blow brought him down,
whereupon he was kicked in the face and
otherwise maltreated. Before he had recov-
ered sufficiently to offer any kind of defence
the woman was explaining to a small gather-
ing that the prostrate one was a thief
tempted by her handbag. "But 1 beat him,”
asserted the proud female, “I know how to
handle his sort. I’ve been married to three
husbands —all robbers.”
THE PUZZLED MIND OF YOUTH.
“Grandpa , can God really do everything ?”
“Yes, Marie.”
“Can he make a piece of paper with only one side?”
“H.H.” : Essendon, which is used to thrills
of a minor kind, was awakened by the frantic
shrieks of a woman ; it leaped from bed
and rushed to its windows just in time to sec
a motor-car dash past bearing a scantily-
clothed female struggling with the driver.
The drama was given a proper finish by a
wild rush of police patrols, stirred to activity
and pursuit by a dozen alarmed telephone-
calls. When the tumult and the shouting
had died away, the suburb returned to its
disturbed rest anticipating something extra-
special in next day’s Melbourne newspapers.
But the whole incident proved to be only
an original plan of marital correction.
Learning that his wife had disregarded his
wishes by attending a dance to which he
objected, the husband had carried her from
bed to his motor-car to take her and report
her conduct to her parents. It was the wil-
ful lady’s shrieks as she struggled to get
control of the steering-wheel that had dis-
turbed the sleep of people along the line of
route.
* * * *
“Trevdee”: The crime wave in Vic. is
extending with a vengeance. At Ballarat
the other day a piano-tuner was busy at
work, when a bull pussyfooted into the music-
room and passed on into a bedroom. When
they got him out a purse containing money
was hanging from his horns.
* * * *
“Percy Pawnticket”: The nerves of Mel-
bourne citizens are frayed under the strain
of the hold-up epidemic, and panting citizens
nightly arrive at outlying police-stations with
stories of great peril. One man had been
chased almost to the door of the station by
a gang of ruffians: when the constable in
charge went into the night he discovered a
stray horse of friendly habits which, in its
loneliness, had decided to attach itself to a
passing human, and, by following, had scared
him out of his wits. At Glenferrie two men,
walking in opposite directions, stopped dead
when each saw the other approaching through
the night mist and slunk into the shadow
to avoid observation. To each that action
in the other appeared suspicious, naturally,
and they both retraced their steps quickly
and stealthily, resolved to proceed by another
back street. At the corner they started to
run, and they were both going at a good bat
when they collided with a yell in the back
street. One man reached a police-station
in a liatless condition to report the assault
and attempted robbery, just as the panting
voice of the other was telling hits exciting
adventure over the wire.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie” : How’s this for the “almost-
impossible” happening? The postmaster at
Merriwa township (N.S.W.) is named South.
When he was attending to a customer
named West the other day a man named
North came in. and asked for his mail,
“We only want East now, and we’d have all
points of the compass,” remarked the p.m.. as
he introduced the pair. “Yes,” came a voire
from the door, "I'm here,” and in walked a
well-known local resident of that name.
“Xex”: Some strategy was shown by the
police in raiding a two-up school at Wan-
ganui (M.L.) lately. A flourishing college
was known to exist on the sand-dunes out-
side the town, but so perfect was the organ-
isation that the Johns found it hard to get
within striking distance. Vigilant sentries
were posted, and
when the Law
arrived it merely
found innocent-
looking persons
strolling over the
sands or absorbing
the scenery. At
last the police tun-
nelled and timbered
a small sandhill,
planted the en-
trance with trees,
constructed a dug-
out, and, armed
with blankets,
food, field-glasses
and cameras, took
up residence there-
in. Early on Sun-
day morning the
ground was widely
patrolled by the
sentries, but the
dugout escaped at-
tention. The school
actually assembled
a few feet from
the place of am-
bush. and as the
pennies began to
fly the cameras
clicked. Many pro-
minent residents of
Wanganui were
p h o tog r a plied,
singly and in
batches. After half
an hour’s play the
Law swooped on
tts prey, and the
sandhills w ere
speckled with
figures sprinting wildly in all directions. A
well-known garage proprietor collided witli a
constable, whereupon “Don’t run so hard,
Ginger,” urged the latter —“we have a bosker
photo of you.” The convictions, largely on
photographic evidence, numbered about 70.
“The Deacon” with another female effigy:
Re the ship’s figurehead in possession of a tribe of
blacks being mistaken for a white girl (B. 31/7/’24),
there is an Auckland (M.L.) master brewer who
knows to his cost how easiiy such an error can
arise, lie is an enthusiastic yachtsman, so when
an old limejuicer was going into the knacker’s yard
he had no difficulty in securing the huge figurehead.
This he erected on his lawn, where the beauteous
apparition commanded a clear view of passengers on
trains going into Auckland Railway Station. .fust
after dusk that evening the art-patron’s troubles
began. An agitated citizen burst in upon the family
at the dinner-table to assure them that a woman
perfectly nude was standing in an attitude of suppli-
cation on the front lawn, and it was only after a
personal inspection and two drinks that the outraged
moralist felt equal to pursuing his homeward path.
On top of this the telephone clanged shrilly, and a
quavering voice begged to inform the householder that
one of his womenfolk was in parts naturalibus in the
garden. Heing put wise .to the facts, a local wow-
SHE'D FOUND OUT THAT MUCH.
“Buy a chance in a surf-girl?”
“No! What'd I do with a doll, girl?
“Suit you down to the ground. A Live girl would just worry you
to death.”
ser disclosed his identity, and thankfully rang off.
Hardly had a large and inquisitive policeman been
shooed off the doorstep when a local newspaper office
rang up to inquire if it was true that an escaped
lunatic had been located on the premises, adding
that one of its brightest young men was on his
way to get the story. The tragedy culminated when
a strong squad of police arrived and took cover at
various points in the pansy beds, while the sergeant,
with a large horserug, stealthily advanced through
the pale moonlight and enveloped the unclothed
figure. And even after that the exasperated brewer
was twice dragged out of bed by friends who wanted
to get the exact strength of the night’s proceedings.
It has been dangerous to talk about ships’ figure-
heads to him ever since.
“Two Seas”: The old four-wheeler was
standing forlornly at the end of a line of
cars. It had a dissolute, out-all-night air
that suggested long waits outside of Dago
oyster-joints; even the old horse seemed to
prick up his ears and wink when I said
something about wanting to get to Coogee.
The owner told me he had won the whole
turnout in a raffle. “If I can get the
blinking outfit smashed up by some rich toff
in a motor-car,” lie remarked hopefully, “I’ll
be all set for a deposit on a taxi.” Then lie
spat gloomily at a mongrel who was sniffing
at the hind leg of liis moke, and added: "But
it’s wonderful ’ow the blighters manage to
dodge a collision with me. He seemed quite
hurt when I refused to engage him.

“Nikko”: No doubt Kitchener was a frosty
and austere personage, but I have seen an-
other side of his character. When lie visited
Auckland, and was installed at the Northern
Club, he noticed a pile of books on the table
in front of him and inquired what they were.
Captain Hugh Boscaweu, lion, aide to a long
succession of Maoriland Governors, explained
that their owners were hopeful of obtaining
the Kitchener autograph. I shall never for-
get the superb sweep with which lv. ot Iv.
pushed the ele-
gant assortment on
to the floor. Later
Captain Boscaweu
was seen to rescue
one of the books
from the pile and
pocket it. The
ke e 11-e ye d Ivit-
chener noticed
him, asked whose
it was, and, hear-
ing that it be-
longed to a youth-
ful Boscawe n,
stretched out his
hand, took the
book, and scrawled
his name across
the page, smiling
grimly the while?.
My first meeting
with the inscrut-
able one was more
impressive. It
took place in
South Africa near
the close of the Boer
war. As a humble
corporal T had been
entrusted wit h
the embarkation of
some tans of army
stores per goods
train. I arrived
at the wayside sta-
tion to find that
there was no room
for my stuff, all
the available space
having been appro-
priated by some
young English offi-
cers, off on a hunt,
with apparently a
trainful of sport-
ing lumber. They
declined to get out
of the trucks, or
move up and I;et
my goods in; and
just as I was won-
d c ring what I
could say to my
Major, Kitchener
arrived unex-
pectedly. The train was about to draw
out when I rushed and craved a word with
the Colonel, who immediately took me along
to the Chief. In five minutes those haughty
young men were out of the trucks, baggage
and all, and my stuff was being frenziedly
loaded in. When the meeting dissolved the
train sped north, K. went east, I hastened
west, and the ejected company sat at the
station waiting for the next event. As there
was no train until next day, and they were
SO FRIENDLY.

The train goes on. I see its black tail twinkle
Close to the tunnel as I pass the gate.
My hard-held adjectives my whiskers sprinkle,
The while it howls aloud its hymn of hate.
The station-roof is like a cloud of fate ;
And one great engine sits in idle sighing —
I wonder if the aerocoach will wait
When we desert the rails and take to flying.
It is the clock that somehow seems to scamper
When trains are early and their victim late ,
Time loves to fool with life and blindly hamper

Through hours and seconds lost beyond denying!
I wonder if the aerocoach will wait

SPARK PLUGS.
OF the many Italia motor accessories, all finely
made, of scientific construction and honest work-
manship, the Italia Spark Plug is a typical
example. The spark emitted is hot, rich and pure,
for the laminated mica insulator absolutely prevents
leakage; the central electrode is thick and strong and
the body is finely made of tough brass. Each part of
this plug may be purchased separately at a fraction
the cost of a new plug, a feature which affords addi-
tional saving should any part become damaged.
Ask to-day at the garage to see the Plug; if unobtain-
able write direct to the Sole Agents:

“Thrust Block”: The Namoi being laid up
in Johnston’s Bay, Sydney, the Newcastle is
the only ocean-going paddle-steamer running
on the Australian coast. She was built
in the early ’eighties for one of the
two companies then concerned as rivals in
the Newcastle and Hunter River trade, and
was considered the last word in speedy and
comfortable coastal voyaging. Originally
she had three raking funnels, with masts
sloping aft at the same acute angle as her
chimneys, but early in her career one of the
boilers was taken out in the interests of
fuel economy, and she remains with the two
for’ard funnels curiously close together. Then-

going a good deal faster than she does, but

she is still quite capable of doing the 70
miles between Darling Harbor and the King’s
Wharf in Newcastle in a little over five hours,
and her wide sponsons impart a steadiness
to her in a beam sea which makes her a
favorite amongst indifferent sailors. Her
saloon is decorated with hand-painted panels
one an excellent portrait of Captain Cook’
and another a picture of the old ship under
steam and sail square-rigged for’ard, as she
used to look m her flapperdom.
"Clerk'’: There’s a diminutive operating
porter at a ’wayback railway station in Vic-
toria who should go far in the service if
resource and initiative count. One recent
wet night, when he was the solitary official
on duty, the last down train pulled out of
tlie station, leaving
on the platform a
broad - shouldered,
six-foot-two drunk,
who lurched into
t h e waiting-room,
flopped on to one
of the seats and
lapsed into snoreful
slumber. The por-
ter, anxious to lock
up and get home,
endeavored vainly
to rouse the re-
cumbent visitor.
The roughest shak-
ing evoked only a
bored grunt; and,
although the regu-
lations empowered
the porter to “re-
move” an intoxi-
cated traveller from
the station pre-
mises, it was hardly
practicable, consid-
ering the respective
sixes of the pair.
Strategy being
clearly demanded,
the porter procured
a rope, with which
he sec ur e d the
drunk’s shoulders
to the back of the
seat. He then
armed himself with
a bucketful of
water, took careful
aim, hurled it over
the captive, and
h a s t i 1 y secreted
himself behind a
couple of milkeans.
Drenched to the
skin, the drunk
staggered up with
a roar of disappro-
val, lugging the
seat with him. He
lost his balance
and came down
flat, the seat
Pi 1 °f him.
Houdini liimself could not have struggled out
of the ropes quicker. Quite awake now, he
regained his feet, stared fearfully around the
dark waiting-room, and fled. The porter
tidied up and went home.

“H.E.R.” : I was
the privileged per-
son to see the
photograph before
it was mailed to
the old folk in Eng-
land. The picture
depicted four immi-
grants “roughing it
450 miles from
Pert li, Western
Australia.” The
evening meal was
in progress, and
one pommy was in
the act of cutting
a slice of bread
from a perfectly-
shaped baker's
loaf; another had
stabbed a sausage
with his fork and
was holding it in
mid-air, while the
third was pouring
tea out of a pot
into a china cup.
The last of the

Ragar”: I’d left a broken-axled Lizzie
miles back along a seldom-used Queensland
bush-track, and had still 20 miles to go to
reach the so-called town I was heading for,
when, towards dusk, I saw smoke rising
from under a line of creek-side trees. Here
was a swaggie making damper, and, greet-
ings exchanged, I helped myself to a panni-
kin of tea and sat down. My explanation
concerning my foodless and swagless condi-
tion failed to arouse much sympathy, and
after we’d fed together on cold corned-mutton
and johnny-cakes I was informed that I’d
better be making a move if I wanted to

and go on to-morrow” was met with “No,
you don’t, mister. You clear out now. I’m
not going to give anyone a chance to talk
about me. Off you go, now.” It wasn’t till
then that I realised I was with a woman,
though she did make the best johnny-cakes
I’ve ever tasted. She was nearer six feet than
I am, and wore the boots, trousers and
other habiliments favored by the general
run of swaggies. I apologised, thanked her,
and headed for “that pub” without further
argument. I’ll swear there wasn’t a soul
within miles of us; but you never know. The
bunyip might have seen me there and started
some silly gossip, though Lord knows the lady
was no Venus.

“Stellsby”: The Vic. policeman in plain-
clothes advertises his calling as effectively as
his colleague in uniform. The most unsophis-
ticated suburbanite knows him by his blue suit,
soft black hat, tie to match, bulk, No. 10’s, slow
gait and numerous inches. To preclude any
possibility of mistake they generally hunt in
pairs. Two of these standardised gentry re-
cently spent a full afternoon, Siamese-twin
fashion, on a door-to-door visit of inquiry in
a street at East St. Kilda. A notorious crook
was suspected of residing in the thoroughfare,
and that was their method of locating him.
They didn’t.

“Hamer” digs up some prison history:—
Tlie passing of the Melbourne Gaol removes what
was originally a Melbourne grievance. The settle-
ment’s first lock-up was established on a Govern-
ment block bounded by Bourke, King, Collins and
Sptneer streets. As offenders were sent for trial
to Sydney, only a temporary “cooler” was required;
but more than once prisoners showed their contempt
for the place by digging themselves out through
the earth floor. A stone watch-house went up in
the Market Reserve in 1839; but the first actual
gaol in Melbourne was near the corner of William
and Flinders streets. It was really a sort of stable,
and the only division of prisoners was in the im-
prisonment of women in the loft and men on the
ground floor. The Crown leased the property from
John Batman for 20s. per week. The Melbourne
gaol that is now disappearing was commenced in
1841, but it wasn't finished till Jan., 1845, when
59 males and nine females were present at the
housewarming. The buildings cost £25,000 ; an
cuter wall which the architect had forgotten was
subsequently added at a cost of £BOO. Situated
in “the woods of Carlton,” on rising land, the big
building frowned down on the settlement, and the
citizens took no pride in it. With the arrival of
the irascible Judge Willis, and the trial of prisoners
and civil cases in Melbourne, and, later, the aboli-
tion of transportation to Port Arthur, the gaol
became cramped and an area was proclaimed in
Melbourne itself, where debtors and civil defaulters
were accommodated. Meanwhile one David Itooney
had been given a contract to erect a treadmill,
which was completed in March 1846. It appears
to have been an inferior bit of work, which took
15 prisoners to get into motion, and Itooney was
ruined through his failure to collect the contract
price (£700) for a scamped job. The cumbersome
affair was tinkered with from time to time, but
was always unpopular with the prisoners: in 1850
there was a strike against its employment, and a
fight with the warders, for which the ringleaders
were punished by solitary confinement and the lash.
Fights and escapes have been frequent incidents in
the gaol’s history. The most curious incident occur-
red when two prisoners named Smith and Stauntoii
worked their way out along a drainpipe to a cesspit
outside. Smith was chased, and found hiding in the
bush near the Yarra Bend Asylum. Nobody would
touch him, but he surrendered under a threat of
being burned out; and he was marched back to
gaol well in advance of his captors. Staunton was
eventually recaptured in Sydney. Melbourne’s first
gaoler was George Wintle, who was Inspector of
Hulks in 1838. The first hangman was Jack Harris,
a strong, persevering man who revelled in the job
and the frequent flagellations. In its earliest days
the old gaol had to serve the purposes of a hospital
and lunatic asylum as well. Pentridge—-originally
the Pentridge Stockade, a sort of gaol village—
came in 1850.
* * * *
“Verri”: How is this for a series of acci-
dents, lucky and otherwise? Three years
ago an Auckland (M.L.) jeweller cemented
his betrothal with a single-diamond engage-
ment-ring worth nearly £2OO. The honey-
moon was spent in Sydney, where the bride
took off the ring when trying on gloves in a
Pitt-street shop. It vanished from the
counter, and all efforts to find it failed. A
month or so ago the Auckland man visited
Sydney on business, and a leading jeweller
showed him a flawless diamond, un-
mounted. The M.L. jeweller saw it was very
like the one that had been lost, and asked
about it. The Sydney jeweller told him that
an elderly, man had brought it into the shop
and sold it. Further inquiry revealed that
this elderly man had bought it from a pawn-
broker for £lO, and, recognising that he had
obtained something good, had offered it for
sale at £3O. Still further inquiries revealed
that the ring had been pawned 18 months
after it was lost, £5 being advanced on it.
The Aucklander paid up £3O, and his wife
now wears the re-set diamond.

“H.K.”: A police-court conviction for a
more curious Sabbath breach than selling
newspapers (B. 31/7/’24) was recorded by
the magistrates at Morpeth (N.S.W.) in
January, 1859. One David Buchanan was
sent to gaol for seven days for going to
church without his coat.

“Stellsby”: “Flicker” doubts that Spain
sheltered I-lun submarines (B. 31/7/’24). I
was one of a R.N. party drafted to England
in a P. and O. steamer from Bombay at a
time when the P. and O. was the only pas-
senger line running consistently through the
Mediterranean ; other boats took the longer
route round the Cape to avoid not only the

Mediterranean, but also the dangerous ap-
proach to the Straits. On the morning of the
day we passed through into the open Atlantic
two steamers were torpedoed a few miles
west of the Straits, and it was proved con-
clusively that the sub. responsible operated
from Cadiz, and not from distant Cuxhaven
or the Adriatic. The ordinary trade route
from Cape St. Vincent up the Portuguese
coast to Finisterre and across the bay to
Ushant was studiously avoided because the
port of Vigo, on the north coast of Spain,
was also suspect; hence shipping bound north
from the Mediterranean invariably made a
wide detour west into the Atlantic, in most
instances bringing up eventually off the south
coast of Ireland, thence gingerly making the
passage up Channel, preferably in night
stages.

Profits in the table do not count in £lO,OOO
which is written off premises each year.
Probably earnings have also been drawn
upon to provide for accidents to advances
whose repayment has become doubtful owing
to the weakening of supporting securities.
But even so the £133,253 regarded as dis-
tributable from the past 12 months’ opera-
tions was quite the best profit disclosed
since the bank was reconstructed on its
present basis: for every £6O shown in the
first year after the A.B.C. acquired the
City Bank of Sydney £lOO is now available.
And still the A.B.C. is not on anything like
the dividend footing of most of its competi-
tors. Its trouble, from a div.-earning point
of view, is that its own funds and long-
distance stock are over-large in relation to
its banking business. But there has been
a big improvement in that respect in recent
years ; having been equipped in the reconstruc-
tion with funds to permit a bigger business,
the management has been widening the field,
and the acquisition of the City Bank and
subsequent steady development have made
the A.B.C. very different from what it was
in 1915, or even only four years back. Here
are comparisons:—

posits, which are terminable at the bank’s
option (though it is obliged to set aside
£30,000 p.a. to redeem them), funds at June
30 amounted to £2,906,634, and for every
£1 of them slightly less than £4 of the pub-
lic’s money was held. A sound bank can
confidently enlarge its business to almost
double that proportion.
The expansion of divisible profits to 11.1
p.c. on paid capital did not influence chair-
man Mark Sheldon and his Board when they
were determining the div. rate for the past
12 months. It remains at 7 p.c., and for
every pound paid out 11s. 9d. has gone into
reserves, apart from any inner appropria-
tions for premises, advances, etc. There
can lie no kick from shareholders: the A.B.C.
Board is doing the proper thing in making
the foundations good; only in that way can
they be reasonably sure that when the div.
rate does go up it will stay there. In the
14£ years since the A.B.C. took over the
old A.J.S. Bank, £419,518 of visible reserves
have accumulated, and that gives extra
backing of almost 7s. for each of the
1,200,000 £1 shares.
During the past 12 months there have
been no movements of consequence in the
balance-sheet; but there have been changes
that reflect the difficulties which the banks,
and especially the smaller ones, have been
up against. Here are comparisons of lia-
bilities :

The expansion of deposits during the past
12 months was really better than the table
shows: the amount of Government money
held declined £110,685, but customers’ de-
posits were £195,857 larger. Inscribed
stock was reduced £42,509 by buying the de-
preciated paper in the market with funds
provided out of the above-mentioned £30,000
annual appropriation required by the Articles.
The increase in liabilities on the year was
shared almost 50-50 by liquid groups and
advances: — „

Liquid assets covered 40.5 P-c. of all cur-
rent liabilities, and £6,898,175 not so repre-
sented had the backing of advances and
premises with a total book value
£9 804 809. All inner reserves and almost
6s.’ in the £ of the balance-sheet values of
advances and premises could be lost before
a penny of customers’ money would be
risked.
The big changes of the period have been
in the liquid group, and they record very
clearly the effect of the impounding of funds
in London: 1923 . 1924.

The amount tied up in bills and London cash
holdings was £440,988 greater than 12 months
back and represented 534 p.c. of all liquid
assets. As in the past 12 months the Lommon-
wealth bought through London approximately
21 millions more than it sold, this hold-up ot
funds in London at first seems anomalous,
particularly in view of the heavy interest
bill and Australian divs. payable, there.
The official trade figures, however, have not
taken into account the Bawra wool shipped
in other years and sold only m the period
under review: £6,000,000 was released be-
tween December and March as the result ot
final Bawra sales. The Commonwealth and
State Governments have been persistent bor-
rowers on the English market, and the pro-
ceeds of their loans have been transferred to
the Commonwealth with the usual Govern-
ment disregard of the cost or eltect
on trading operations. More than £30,000,066
is estimated to have been shifted to the. Lom-
monwealth by Government borrowers m the
past 12 months. The exchange position nas
also been aggravated to a slight extent by
the interest which many English manufac-
turers are taking in the Commonwealth s
industrial expansion: much English money
—the amount cannot be ascertained, ot
course —has come to the Commonwealth in
recent years to finance the growth of numer-
ous industries, in which big English corpora-
tions have become partners. But that in-
vestment of outside capital, bringing with it
the technical knowledge necessary for newer
industries, is all to the good. For some
years to come, however, the world s dis-
ordered currencies must be expected to con-
tinue to affect the Commonwealth’s only
clearing-house abroad, and to disturb the
local money market, and the Commonwealth
and State Treasuries, the Notes Board and
bankers generally are likely to be faced with
some stiff problems.

Disclosed profits are keeping nicely in step
with the growing capital. At June 30 the
latter amounted to £3,476,287, and at the
end of July it should have reached 3| mil-
lions, the final call on the issue made last
year having then fallen due. Paid capital
has doubled in 12 years, and as all the new
holdings have been issued at par, proprietors
have done well with regular 10 p.c. divs.
These divs. are very easily earned, because
while millions have flowed into capital
account, surplus profits have taken visible
reserves to almost £2,790,000. Shareholders
funds have to earn only 5.6 p.c. to pay 10
p.c. on present subscribed capital; and actu-
ally average funds for the past 12 months
earned 7.6 p.c. At least, that is what the
published accounts say was earned; most
likely the directors didn’t parade the whole
of the harvest. On this occasion, besides
‘■full provision having been made as usual
for all probable losses and contingencies,” the
book value of premises has had more than
usual attention. One-half of the new head-
quarters in Sydney has been completed, and
work on the other half, on the site
of the old premises, is now proceeding. The
book value of properties advanced from
£794,926 in 1922 to £929,846 in 1923. and
during the past 12 months to £955.000 —“a
very considerable amount of capital expen-
diture having, as usual, been written off.”
The large visible and internal reserves make
the C.B.S. very robust.
The outstanding features of the year were:
(1) a slight decline in deposits held, which
the management says was almost entirely
accounted for by the repayment ot ±800,006
of Bawra money held temporarily at the
previous balance; (2) the reduction of liquid
assets by £2,125,082; (31 the disposal of
more than 41 p.c. of the War Loan and other
Government securities on the books at the
1923 balance; and (4) the growth of
advances by £1.943,157. The movements m
the last two groups show that the directors
were more actively employing the bank’s re-
sources. Twelve months back the liquid
position was abnormally strong: £54 of every
£lOO in the bank’s care was held in that way.
Even now £49 16s. is within easy reach or
in securities backed by the Commonwealth
and British Governments, and that is much
more than a bank like this need hold liquid
under normal conditions. Portion of the
money received from the sale of securities
gave greater fluidity to the liquid group, the
holdings of coin, bullion, Australian notes,
etc., having expanded from £7,737,877 to
£8,680,273. The securities sold had no doubt
been heavily written down, and big surpluses
over and above book values were probably
won in the market; on that point the direc-
tors are dumb, but a statement of the trans-
fers of surpluses from the securities depart-
ment to the premises and advances accounts
during the year would probably tell an in-
teresting story.
The next table shows how balance-sheet
groups have moved in 10 years:—

Premises, etc... 568,253 929,846 955,000
Even with liquid assets curtailed and
advances enlarged the position of the C.B.S.
is very strong. The £17,494,420 of cus-
tomers’ money not held liquid at June 30
had the backing of advances and premises
publicly shown at £23,933,036; so that
general-manager Massie, when presently he
hands over the keys to his successor, will be
able to do it without any qualms of con-
science.

On this occasion it is “Goodlet and Smith,
Ltd. and Reduced” ; the co. is in the throes
of another reconstruction in which share-
holders are to have half their capital re-
turned. The co. has had a remarkable
career: for many years prior to 1918 capital
was £165,000, and S p.c. was the biggest
dividend. But the div. rates had not reflected
the earning’s: visible reserves grew steadily,
large amounts were won by selling city
and suburban properties at prices greatly
in excess of cost, dutside investments
turned up trumps, and the directors had also
stowed a bit of profit out of sight. Only
four years ago assets were written up £55,000,
and now a reserve fund of £25,000 suddenly
appears in the accounts as the result of a
consolidation of “sundry provisions which
had been made for various risks and contin-
gencies.” In 1918 £55,000 of capital was
returned, and the balance of scrip (£110,000)
was doubled by a bonus issue. Now £llO,OOO
more cash is to be handed back, thus making
a total return of the whole of the
capital put into the business, and still leaving
shareholders with £2OO of scrip for every
£3OO issued prior to 1920. The div. prospects
after the duplication of scrip in 1920 did
not seem rosy, and the £1 shares could be
picked up in the market at under 16s. Buyers
at that price seem to have made a good
punch : they are to receive 10s. per share in
cash, and the latest accounts say that there
are 13s. of assets left for every ,10s. share.
Since 1922 the scrip has been above par
value, the co. having shown its capacity to
earn more than 6 p.c. on the enlarged capital.
The following table shows balance-sheet
movements subsequent to the last reconstruc-
tion :
1921. 1923. 1924.
Machinery, plant, etc... £54,000 £50,000 £30,000
Stocks 20,371 19,151 16,772

Liabilities .. 63,136 36,156 ■ —
Net assets .. .. £233,405 £237,803 £262,824
The expansion for the past 12 months must
be considered in relation to the disclosure
of £25,000 of inner reserves. The feature of
the latest accounts was that at the balancing
date all creditors had been paid off! to a penny
to facilitate the reduction of capital. The
figures suggest that the extent of the co.’s
timber and builders’ supply business is nowa-
days not large; evidently, also, competition
has been severe: the directors say the trade
in timbers lias been “well maintained,” but
that “inadequate prices have ruled and left
a comparatively small return.” The main
consideration now is what 13s. of assets can
earn for the 10s. of scrip left after paying off
half the present capital. The published
accounts never have been much guide for the
investor, and the outsider cannot learn
whether the cash to be distributed has been
derived from selling some of the more re-
munerative investments, or what sort of goods
are left in the co.’s bag.

This very successful old colliery co. is also
“reduced” : early in the half-year covered by
the latest accounts £30,000 of capital was
returned. But the co. had such bulging
pockets that £38,926 of the £60,000 of capital
left is represented by liquid assets in excess
of liabilities: —

Surplus .. £22,316 £72,724 £72,515 £38,926
In the introductory table profits for previous
years have included additions to a reserve
for taxation. During the last six months this
reserve has been drawn upon for £3OOO, and
that amount is shown in the table as written
off. Output and marketing of fuel was quite
equal to recent performances, but exes, were
heavier (unspecified provision for deprecia-
tion is included with the charges, by the
way), and the return from investments natu-
rally fell owing to loss of interest from the
£30,000 of funds disbursed:. interest, rents,
etc., dropped from £2837 to £l7OO.
The net profit disclosed for the period was
smaller than the div. paid: the directors are
so satisfied with the co.’s present position
and prospects that they took the whole of
current earnings and all except £4O of the
£466 carry-forward from the previous term to
pay a shilling div. and a bonus of 6>d. per
share, and that on shares paid to 13s. 4d.
means a div. rate of 321 p.c. p.a. When that
div. had been paid the Vale of Clwydd still

Though “increased business” is the official
explanation of the sudden leap of profits in
the past two years, there may be another
reason. The Pussyfoot movement in Queens-
land has almost faded out since the two
polls, the second in October last, told the
breweries that their business was not to be
molested yet awhile. While the issue was in
doubt it would have been imprudent to set
up big profits as a cock-shy for 'the no-
liquor party. Having little to fear now, the
directors may have decided that they can
pump some of the laid-by profits from the
cellar. The Queensland Brewery never
seemed to be in the least doubt about the
future of beer: for years it has been expand-
ing its connections (a Toowoomba brewery
was purchased in the 1923 financial year,
and that followed the gradual enlargement of
plant and addition of properties), and a lot

of new capital has been called in. The earn-
ings of these new funds have, no doubt, had
a big say in profits, which have nearly trebled
in six years. Only two years back paid
capital was £123,009; by the 1923 balance
it had been increased to £150,000 ; and during
the past 12 months £50,000 more was called
in. Gross trading profits have meanwhile
swelled in this way: 1922, £101,405; 1923,
£145,272; 1924, £196,499.
For the past two years the div. rate has
been 10 p.c., and it has been easily paid:
£16,795 was left last year after distributing
£23,375. Of the surplus a round £6OOO went
into the general reserve and £5OOO into a
div. equalisation fund, the whole of the
balance (£5795) being dropped into a con-
tingencies reserve. In the introductory table
the contingency appropriations are shown as
written off, but as there have been no dis-
appearances from this reserve, except with-
drawals which provided £26,000-odd of bonus
scrip, the £25,510 now lying there can prob-
ably be regarded as accumulated profit like
the £45,000 in other reserves.
The next comparisons show how the
balance-sheet figures have expanded over
several periods:—
1910. 1915. 19.20. 1923. 1924.
Liabilities £28,424 £26,888 £31,476 £59,573 £55,122
Fixed assets 44,587 55,992 73,643 112,512 154,455
Stock . . 12,176 17,617 44,795 53,724 64,176
Book debts 11,182 38,870 45,804 101,451 114,115
Cash, etc. 775 10,926 9,846 3,191 3,510
Since 1915 the book value of assets lias gone
from £123,405 to £336,257. The extensions
have been financed almost wholly out of new
capital and by surplus profits; outside lia-
bilities have moved only from £26,888 to
£55,122 in the nine years. The recent larger
earnings, taken into consideration with the
£70.510 of reserves, assisting £200,000 of
paid capital, suggest that the co.’s 10 p.c.
is pretty safe, with, perhaps, other possi-
bilities if the prospects are as good as the
directors believe they are, and if public
opinion does not suddenly swing towards
Cold Tea.

The forecast that the big B. 11. Prop, steel-
works had made a good recovery from the
ugly position into which the industry had
slipped when the world’s steel prices slumped
after the war is confirmed by a preliminary
statement of financial results for the 12
months ended May. The management re-
ports that the accounts, which will be pub-
lished shortly, show a net profit of £279,339
after paying £121.546 debenture interest and
setting aside £156153 for ordinary depre-
ciation and £142,965 for “special deprecia-
tion.” Of course, the figures include returns
from the old mine at Broken Hill, which
lias had good lead and zinc markets to help it.
* * * *
Ilampden-Cloncurry (N.Q.) activities have
been almost wholly confined to protecting
the group of mines against the rising floods
and to pushing the merger with Mt. Elliott.
The two Boards have agreed upon the “gen-
eral outline” of an amalgamation scheme,
and a draft agreement is on the way to
London for ratification by Elliott directors.
The proposals provide for the establishment
of a new Australian co. which will acquire
the mining and smelting assets, of the two
groups and proceed to re-organise the busi-
nesses. Of course, much new capital will be
required: amalgamation intentions are to
issue prefs.. which will be underwritten by
both the old cos., and to make the scrip
available for present shareholders.
For the six months ended February Hamp-
den-Cloncurry treated no ore, but tributors
were allowed to continue to gouge in the
Wallaroo and Magnet mines. In the Hamp-
den water has risen to the 220 ft. level; pump-
ing has kept the Trekelano dry; and, owing
to the rush of waters after the February
rains, baling was necessary to keep the
Answer workings safe —water-level there has
been lowered to 120 ft. Mine and office costs
for the half-year ran into £8222; divs., in-
terest and royalty contributed £lB4O. Added
to that loss of £6382 the directors took
£7301 for depreciation, both amounts having
been covered by withdrawals from the equal-
isation reserve, which now totals £233,824.
But a big slice of that accumulation isn’t
available for divs., being invested in mines
and works. Despite its unhappy mining posi-
tion, Ilampden-Cloncurry is far from being
down and out: stores, fluxes and fuels and
odds-and-ends of cash assets exceeded all
outside liabilities by £l2 540, and in addi-
tion there were these holdings in other cos.:
Metal Manufactures Pty.. £78,715; Elec-
trolytic Refining. £6315; Copper Producers’
Association, £lOOO. Since the half-year
closed these investments have contributed
£14,456 more divs.

Several Adelaide cos., including the Hansel
Murtdy, have hurriedly migrated to Wiluna
(W.A. ) on the strength of a report that
high values have been cut in one of the Ivan-
hoc’s bores. Mararoa, which took up some
ground at this centre some months ago, in-
tends to bore, and Hansel Mundy will pro-
bably try to rake in funds from calls for
similar work. The latter co.’s holding, known
as the Moonlight, has been mined intermit-
tently for over 20 years, and lias produced
about £50,000 worth of gold. At depth the
Wiluna ores are refractory.
* * * *
Whim Well Copper (W.A.) lias decided
to experiment with a new type of sulmnae
plant. Several processes have already been
tried with unsatisfactory results as to both
recoveries and costs. The local Copper Sepa-
ration Co., with its “simple, cheap and high
recovery” process, is the new crowd to tackle
Whim Well.
* * * *
Freney and Okes Durak oil cos. (W.A.)
are “conferring” with a view to amalgama-
tion. The former has £lO,OOO, a trouble-
some plant and, in its opinion, a "good
chance” of striking oil. Okes has over
£13,000, a good drill and no prospects. A
fusion on a 50-50 basis is suggested by Adel-
aide supporters of both cos.
* * * *
Lass o’ Cowrie (W.A.), which was hailed
as a “great mine” at the beginning but whicn
soon proved to be a dud, has again obtruded
itself. A new shoot is said to have been
found. More development is necessary to
prove that it isn’t like the old one, which
was short and narrow and practically worth-
less.
* * * *
Mararoa’s old cast-off at Norseman
(W.A.) still produces a little gold. The
local State mill recently put through three
parcels for 2400 z.. the material averaging
about an ounce. The old show has given
more than £BOOO gold since the co. quitted.
From F. G. Clapp, at Broome (W.A.) :
Since the “Wild Cat” has written sarcastically (B.
10/7/’24) concerning my sciontitic expedition, which
is financed by Sydney and Melbourne individuals, I
wish to inquire how it is competent to criticise the
work of an engineer who has been in the geological
exploration and oil business for many years? My
report that has been quoted so widely covercl
merely the western part of oil-prospecting block one
H, and I have never reported on the entire North-
West, as you assume. As to the preparations of the
expedition resembling those of an Indian rajah,
all I can say is that nowadays a scientific expedi-
ditien in search of oil requires more careful out-
fitting than that of animal-hunters. I was
obliged to provision for geologist, mechanics and
bushmen for months, in order to investigate
regions never visited by white men, and I was also
obliged to carry regular scientific and technical
equipment. The employment of tractors was be-
cause they constituted the most feasible method of
entering the desert, certain portions of which, much
less accessible than you infer, have been covered by
my geological work. No geologist has ever reported
on the particular area covered by me. I have not
visited Jugurra Creek, but am studying the region
farther south on the plateau east, stretches of which
have never been seen by white men, where we have
sometimes crossed as many as 50 high sand-ridges
per day, and have not found water for as much as
six days. Regarding local advice offering by num-
bers of people, I wish to saj r that it was very amusing.
Of course a man who has spent half his life in the
bush, and has traversed American and Asiatic
deserts, would, not take advice from Tom, Dick and
Harry, unless constructively offered. The occasional
hostility of the blacks in certain regions constitutes
the necessity for having firearms. A serviceable
wireless plant would have been profitable. The
hauling of petrol by truck into localities within 100
miles of Broome proved a good business expedient.
Now, as to a bushman having taken command, that
statement is untrue. I am in charge, and no bush-
man would be selected to command a scientific party
unless he were also a geologist. American geolo-
gists have the reputation of being the best white
bushmen in the world, and only need other bushmen
in the capacity of assistants. Whose business is
this, anyway, except that of my clients?
* * * *
North Mt. Farrell (Tas.) issued accounts
for the half-year ended .Tune showing £3252
net profit, and then discovered that someone
had forgotten to take into account £(>soo of
ore in course of settlement. So a second lot
of accounts, showing £0752 profit, is being
distributed among shareholders. Little shows
like North Farrell necessarily depend. on high
prices for metals, and as lead and zinc have
both been booihing, and as there arc only
80,000 shares to feed, the co. found Is. during
the half-year, and has distributed ano.ther Is.
this week. That the North Farrell is on the
small side is shown by its last two years’
work: —
Marketable
Crudes. Ore.
Dec., 1922.. 11,927 tons. 1614 tons.
June, 1923.. 9,330 „ 1184 „
Dec., 1923.. 10,220 „ 1485 „
June, 1924.. 11,347 „ 1461 „
Ore in reserve at 15,161 tons represents a
month’s crushing at a big Broken Hill mine,
but this Tas. show scores with the richness
of its ore. Nearly all the sulphides now
come from the Nos. 6 and 7 levels. The
shoot south at No. 6 looks blue, so the north-
ern stopes have to be relied upon. North
in the main drive a new make of ore 14ft.
wide was cut after 35ft. of barren stuff had
replaced milling sulphides, and that develop-
ment seems to have saved the situation.
Crosscuts have also opened up narrow shoots,
so that manager Owen Williams can write
that on the whole the level has not only
held its own very well, but the new lens
north “gives encouragement for the next
level.” This justifies the sinking of a new
level, and the work is already in hand. De-
velopment in the shallower levels has drawn
blanks. The smallness of proved ore reserves
is the principal weakness of the show.
* * * *
Old Vegetable Creek Co., with ,T. Atkinson
still in command, is pushing ahead at the
Wild Cherry, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), with
satisfactory results. Work is proceeding on
two pipes of ore. The eastern one gave
practically all last year’s £BOOO-odd of
revenue, but lately it has been of lower
grade, though still going strong with a 20ft.
diameter. Work was commenced on the
western pipe in January last, and so far it
shows no signs of cutting out: it has improved
in both size and grade. Manager Atkinson’s
trouble is that he does not know what is
ahead; in Emmaville days boreholes told
him what to expect. Nowadays the ore
comes out as sinking proceeds, and there is
not much evidence to tell of the behavior of
the pipes deeper. On present appearances the
formations seem to offer more than the four
months’ work recently forecasted by the
‘‘Wild Cat,” but in this class of mining it
is impossible to make any accurate forecast
of quantities or of grade.
* * * *
It is a long while since Ardlethan
(N.S.W.) had a dividend; but Carpathia
looks to be in a position to soon pay one.

Lake Bunga Oil Wells Co. is being under-
written and floated by Joe Maughan, Alex.
Peacock’s lieutenant in Melbourne, to buy
Shirrefs and Duncan’s lease at Lake Bunga.
The Mines Department told G. W. Shirrefs,
a prospector, nearly a year ago that because
of the depth of the tertiary rocks along the
Ninety-mile Beach from the Lakes Entrance,
Gippsland, east to Mallacoota Inlet, a spot
east of Cunninghame seemed a favorable
location for a test bore. It lent Shirrefs a
big steam-driven Calyx rotary drill capable
o: 1 ’ going to 4000 ft. Also Baragwanath, the
State Geologist, gave the prospecting syndi-
cate good advice. The bore has reached
1076 ft., and when water came in along with
a heavy flow of gas, drilling was suspended.
A funnel was fixed at the casing-head, and
the gas passed through it throws a sheet of
flame. The oily globules are collected in a
settling-tank, and ,1. C. Watson, chief chem-
ist of the Mines Department, has definitely
identified the scum as “a heavy crude petro-
leum.” The issue underwritten totals
50,000 £1 shares payable 3s. on allotment.
Vendors, promoters and brokers take 25,000
fully-paids and £2500 cash, and a further
£lOOO and 5000 shares if a w T ell is successful.
The co. has applied for 960 acres, and nearly
the whole of the parish of Tambo has been
pegged out.
* * * *
Stanthorpe (Q.), having said good-bye to
tin, has become an important arsenic pro-
ducer ; the latter mines are all out to the
west of the granite area in the slate coun-
try of Jibbenbar, Sundown, etc. For the
quarter ended June 223 tons arsenious
oxide worth £12,448 were produced. The
State mine gave £SOOO worth, and the
balance came from the Beecroft. In addi-
tion. the Beecroft sent SO tons of 30 p.c. ore
to Wallangarra for treatment, adding an-
other £l4OO to the value of its output.
* * * *
At the Hercules, Bendigo, only the size of
the formation at the 1380 ft. and 1520 ft.
levels enables 7dwt. stone to earn profits. At
the higher level the grade is just on the pay
margin, but the old mine generally responds
to work, so driving goes on. Better stone
shows at 1475 ft., but the face of the 1520 ft.
level is poor. Overhead the rise w r ent
through 15dw r t. quartz, and this ore should
sweeten returns soon. The 1620 ft. north
level is being shoved ahead, and in the faulted
ground there are enrichments which will help
battery averages. If this level continues to
develop favorably Hercules will probably
have another market spin.

Eric Byron Moore, having raked over
Malayan and Siamese tin-fields, has turned
his attention to gold-dredging areas on Maori-
land’s Shotover River. A float of 50,000
shares is under way; vendor Patterson takes
30 p.c. in fully-paids for the rights, the pro-
moting syndicate is to receive 7000 paids,
and Byron Moore 2000. The public is to
be offered 26,000 at ss. Patterson has been
sluicing on the Shotover, and Byron Moore
considers that an efficient plant should make
profits on leaner returns than Patterson has
obtained. A Thompson suction-cutter dredge
is to be placed on the show'.
* * * *
Rawang, the Pratten-New r man Malayan tin-
show which has had the Sydney market
guessing several times, is out with reports
and accounts for the 12 months ended March.
Results were very disappointing: 1,069,000
e. yd. (including overburden) gave 318 tons
of 74.4 p.c. tin ore, an average of only sib.
per yard. After providing for depreciation
the net profit was only £7817. all of which
has been laid aside for asset-wastage. The
disappointment, was due entirely to the
plants having unexpectedly gone through a
low-grade area. Bores ahead give better
promise for the current year, and F. G.
Pratten talks of “extremely good ground”
which should be ploughed up by .Tune.
Rawang has also had flood troubles: the
rush of water has been more severe than
expected. Plant and mine were flooded in
September and again in May, and dams have
had to be strengthened. The bright spot
in the year's operations was the behavior of
the 14in. plant, which fulfilled yardage ex-
pectations and performed its work at less
than 6d. per yd. The new bucket dredge
should be in running order by the close of
this year.

Valentine J. Saddler, who died the other
day, began his career in the Bank of N.S.W.,
which he left to become accountant to C.
and E. Millar, the old-time railway con-
tractors. When they gave up business,
he linked up with Baxter, and their firm
built many Australian railways. Saddler
once owned a station near Brewarrina
(N.S.W.), but he was best known as a
director of Dunlop Rubber Co., Silverton
Tram Co., Colonial Mutual Fire and Young-
husband and Co.—all prosperous concerns.
He was always ready to take a risk in
mining, one of his last ventures being the
Mount Isa Prop., of which he was chair-
man.
Prendcrgast proposes to give a commis-
sion to Web Gilbert to fashion a bust of
George Higinbotham to keep Alfred Deakin’s
company at Vic. State Parliament House.
It is 32 years since Higinbotham died, but
Conservatism has never forgiven him because,
when . Chief Justice in 18!)0, he sent £5O to
the Trades Hall during the maritime strike
and promised to continue contributing till
the employers consented to a conference.
Senator J. D. MILLEN ( Tas .).
lh e memory of C. 0. Kingston, statesman
and lawyer, has been absolved by the high-
est legal tribunal. About 30 years ago he
aud his childless wife made a bargain with
the trustees of his father’s will, giving up
a town house in Adelaide and getting one by
the seashore at Brighton. Latterly some
relatives of a younger generation have
claimed that this bargain was a breach of
trust. S.A. Supreme Court said that it was
not; the High Court on appeal thought it
was; and now the judicial side of the Privy
Council has finally decided that it was not.
“Lei” : The largest figures in Australian
industrialism when this century was opening
are well scattered —and well to the fore.
Tom Mann, whose eight days’ trial at Albury
(N.S.W.) was the central feature of the
prosecutions arising out of one of the big
Broken Hill strikes, is now in England, and
has written a book of Memoirs. Harry
Holland, who was sentenced to two years,
is now leader of the Labor party in the M.L.
Parliament, and has an eye on the Prime
Ministership. Harry Gray, in whose house
Holland was arrested at Broken Hill, and
who was himself a strike prisoner, was
recently elected to the Westralian Leg. Coun-
cil. Norman Makin, whom Justice Pring
refused to allow to act as clerk for Holland
when the latter was defending himself, is
M.ILR. for Hindmarsh (S.A.). Arthur Wal-
lace, at whose wedding at Broken Hill Tom
Mann was “best man,” is now M.L.A. for
Albert Park (Vic.). Jack Gunn, who was
one of Tom Mann’s disciples and used to
speak at Yarra Bank with Holland, is Pre-
mier of S. Australia. Little Billy Rosser,
another Barrier strike prisoner, volunteered
early when the World War broke out, and
was killed by a German shell in France.
Maoriland will shortly lose its Jellicos.
Not only is he the most popular Governor on
local record, but the family has been taken
to the bosom of
the Windy Isles.
Lady .Tellicoe and
the elder girls have
visited in private
homes to an extent
undreamed of by
any other Gover-
nor’s family. The
chief delight of
.Jellicoe himself is
to go fishing at
Taupo, where, clad
in disreputable kit,
he plays the rain-
bow trout whole-
heartedly, and
camps with the
family on the lake
shores. If a con-
descending indivi-
dual follows him
the unfortunate
man will fi n d
what unpopularity
really is.
D. L. McNamara,
Vic. Minister for
Mines and Forests.
“T. 0.1.”: Jolm Bridge, whose .son Clar-
ence, Sydney alderman and wool salesman,
died suddenly the other day, commenced his
produce business in 1872 in a stone build-
ing now covered by Goldsbrougk-Mort’s big
warehouse. Bridge was his own traveller,
and in the old days I met him in many
country towns. He was a man of sterling
worth with a hatred of injustice. On one
occasion at Grenfell a half-witted girl stole
a small ornament, and was given six months
by local .T’s.P. The nearest railway station
to Grenfell was then Murrumburrah, but
Bridge, who happened to be in the town at
the time, went across, took the first train
to Sydney and returned in a couple of days
with the order of release.
Of the N.S.W. Leg. Assembly of 73 mem-
bers which was elected in 1872 but one, Dr.
Creed, is alive. He sat in the Lower House for
only one Parliament (the seventh), but was
appointed to the Leg. Council in August,
1885, and is now the Father of the House.
Of the 31 members of the Council of 1872
every one has gone over the range.
J. C. Kirby, who died in Adelaide the other
day at 88, was a sciou of a well-to-do flour-
milling family in England, came first to
Sydney on business, joined the Pitt-street
Congregational Church, and ultimately be-
came a minister. Later he went to Queens-
land and had churches at Ipswich, Roma and
Dalby. He always claimed to have had a big
hand in the first Kanaka-restriction Act of
1878. In the ’seventies he was back in
N.S.W., and became chairman of the Con-
gregational Union. In 1880 he went to S.
Australia, lived mainly at Port Adelaide, be-
came chairman of the Union and worked hard
for temperance, social purity and (till it
was given) woman’s franchise.
James E. Goodfellow, who has died in
Adelaide, was one of S.A.’s best cricketers
half a century ago, played for the State
against Lilywhite’s English team in 1878,
and founded the first Metropolitan Cricket
Association. He was a partner in one of
the first sports depots in S.A., and later took
to sharebroking.
The projected “Legal-aid Bureau” of the
S. Aus. Labor Government will probably
mean more work for A. J. Hannan, who re-
cently acted as Crown Solicitor during the
absence in England of Dr. Richards. Hannan
had a brilliant scholastic career, and after
admission to the Bar went direct to the Crown
Law Office. At present he is Parliamentary
Draughtsman and Assistant Crown Solicitor.
A good oarsman—he was in the ’Varsity eight
of his time —he still takes an active interest
in the sport. Besides lecturing at the Law
School, he has found time to write a few
books, the latest a very complete work on
police-court procedure.
Dead at Port Adelaide, two prominent
yachtsmen of the past. One, William Bussell,
astronomer and mathematician, was the
senior member of the B.S.A. Yacht Squad-
ron, and a leading sailmakcr in his day. The
other, John Playfair, engineer and iron
founder, was a foundation member of the
Squadron, champion sculler of the Port in his
younger days, and later a starter, judge, and
sailer and owner of yachts.
“Flicker”: Well, Sullivan, the S. Austra-
lian, was the last Digger to win the V.C.
He was on the way to France when the
Armistice was signed, and so didn’t get into
the Big Scrap. But lie joined the expedition
to Bussia, and in his first engagement won
the most coveted of all decorations, and re-
turned home without a scratch to his job
in the National Bank.
From Theo. Dewar, of Brisbane: —
In correction of “Onibus’s” statement that “until
August, 185 S, there was no Stock Exchange (Mel-
bourne) and no mining company’’ (B. 24/7/’24),
let me recall that my father, Alexander Dewar, was
presented with a gold watch, now in my posses-
sion, by the Old Gravel Pits G. M. Co., Ballarat, “for
his zeal in promoting the interests of the company
during the 18 months he was manager. May 21st,
1859.” My father told me he was the first manager
of a joint-stock mining co. in Victoria. He was
afterwards manager of the Buningyong, Scotchman’s
Lead; the Albion, Sebastopol; the Tookey, at Thames
(M.L.) ; years later, of the Brisbane Blocks,
Broken Hill, and finally of the Mount Morgan mine
from ’94 to ’97. He died at Auckland in 1911, at
the age of 83. His widow is still well and hearty
at 91, and retains vivid memories of Ballarat in the
’fifties.
_ “8.5. A.”: Although he wouldn’t say it
himself, it is claimed for Sammy Lynch that
he lias the world’s record for carrying mails
packed on horses. He runs a five-weekly
service of 1000 miles between Alice Springs
and Powell Greek, and recently completed
51,000 miles.
A man who sang himself into Parliament
is Syd Jackson, M.H.B. His hobby is assist-
ing the Bush Nursing Association, and with
10 show’s at which he was the sole performer
he raised £ GOO. At a lone-handed entertain-
ment for the Tas. nurses at the National
Theatre, Launceston, in July, this human
gramophone gave 26 songs and recitations,
not counting encores.
“Knib”: It is one thing for a member of
Parliament to barrack for concessions for
constituents who are behindhand with their
selection rents, and quite another to cash
up the deficiency. But Little Dr. Maloney did
the latter not so long ago. And she wasn’t
even a constituent' either, but a poor old
dame from Gippsland whom he had known
when he was a kiddie. She couldn’t pay
up £l7, and yearned for her Crown grant
in her lifetime. There was no power to
wipe off the debt to the Grown, so the doc.
borrowed a pen and wrote a cheque. And
he did it as if he were discharging an obliga-
tion, telling the Lands officer that the old lady
had fed him with hot cakes on her back
verandah when he played truant from home.
Passed on, at Waikato (M.L.), Beni Man-
gamUtu. a Maori woman who had reached
100 or thereabout, and whose memory car-
ried her back to the days before the coming
of the pakeha. She Jiad much to tell of the
old-time tribal wars and of the cannibal cus-
toms of her people. In far-off days the
women used to follow a fight and bring in the
dead bodies of the enemies to the pahs, but
after that no female hand was allowed to
touch them.
“Kelpie”: The breeder of the champion
ewe at the recent Wentworth (N.S.W.)
show, James Maynard, of Allandale station,
is a Western identity whose memories of
Darling Biver shows go back to 1885. In
that year Tapio blood swept the board, as it
had already done just previously at Denili-
quin. Tapio station, in the Murray-Darling
crutch, which shore 40,000 sheep in the ’eight-
ies, was then laying the foundations of the
strain that provided the parent stock of most
of the present Darling flocks, though more
recently Wanganella blood has been intro-
duced, the latest importation being a ram
bought by the Armstrongs, of Lake Victoria,
at the last Sydney sheep show, for £675.
“Max M.”: If Moses Gabb, M.H.8., per-
sists in advocating his defence theories and
the Labor party tries to stop him, as has
been hinted, Moses may not take kindly to
the discipline. As a matter of fact, he is
one of the most courageous members of the
party. He resigned from the Methodist
ministry and went market-gardening because
he refused to swallow some of the dogmas
of the church. Until the last election, when
he accepted his return as justification, he
religiously refrained from participating in
the salary grab, his extra £2OO a year
going to the funds of the S.A. Labor party
Like P. G. Stewart, late Federal Minister
for Works, Tom Molomby, the new Vic. Rail-
way commissioner, learned the rudiments of
commerce as a newsboy. If certain un-
pleasant obstacles had not been raised, he
would have had the commissionership before
Miscamble, whom he now succeeds.
The N.T. has an old identity in Tommy
Pearse, who crossed the continent with bul-
lock-waggons from
Adelaide half a
century ago, work-
ing for Giles the
explorer. On that
trip the stores
were used on two
occasions for a
barricade against
hostile abos. The
longest stretch
without water was
110 miles. Forty-
five years ago
Pearse decided to
make a home for
himself near Pine
Creek; and at 75
he still scorns the
old-age pension.
MAURICE,
BARRY, Mayor
of Brisbane, a
genial figure in
the city’s centen-
ary celebrations.
J. A. Hartley, formerly Inspector-General
of Education in S. Aus., has a rare monu-
ment —his primer and first reading-book are
still doing duty in the schools of that
State and Victoria, though they were first
issued, in the late ’eighties. Latter-day infant
and kindergarten educationists have tried to
supplant them, but they still remain the
favorites with teachers and scholars. Hartley
met his death by accident 27 years ago.
. “Knib” : How Hill must have puffed out
his chest when he got Bruce’s wireless offer-
ing him the Works and Railways portfolio!
To be chased across the ocean like this in-
stead of having to hang around is something
out. of the way. Those of us who have been
behind the scenes know how elated George
Swinburne was when Bent combed England
by cable to find and offer him the Water
Supply portfolio in February, 1904. But
we also recall how Swinburne left Bent
very suddenly when the Ministry was drift-
ing on the rocks in 1908. Will history re-
peat itself?
. “Gol Gol” : Chester Sandilands, of Koor-
lnga (S.A.), who judged the sheep at the
Wentworth (N.S.W.) show this year, is the
son of a man who judged jumbucks and wool
there a .generation ago, and his uncle man-
aged Mildura sheep-run, a few miles away
across the Murray, 20 years before the Chaf-
feys struck Australia. The nominal value
of Mildura lands was then less than 2s. 6d.
a square mile, and the run-holders went
broke in trying to earn it. In the modern
Mildura, where improved land is worth hun-
dreds of pounds an acre, there is an avenue
named after the pioneer Sandilands of the
pastoral era.. The shade of the old man
must blink with astonishment if he glimpses
the Murray these days.
Mention of William Balcombe
yk- J/°/ 24) recalls that an interesting
thread of Napoleonic history is woven into
his appointment as the first N.S.W. Colonial
Iroasurer in 1824. Formerly attached to
the Navy, Balcombe was filling a post at St.
Helena when Napoleon arrived there in 1815.
He extended the fallen Emperor marked hos-
pitality and the pair became firm friends —
a fact largely attributable to the vivacity of
little Betsy Balcombe, which greatly pleased
the exiled monarch. Sir Hudson Lowe, Gov-
ernor of the island, did not conceal
his disapproval of this entente cordiale, and
besides making matters uncomfortable for his
prisoner got Balcombe recalled to England.
Recognising the latter’s capacity the authori-
ties got out of the difficulty by sending him
to Sydney. In after years Betsy Balcombe,
then Mrs. Abel, published in England her
memoirs of Napoleon. W. A. Balcombe, who
was Deputy-Registrar in Equity at Sydney
for some years, is a grandson of the former
Treasurer.
One of the picturesque figures of legal
and literary Sydney is P. P. Packliam, of the
Attorney-General’s library. Quarter of a
century ago. he was the Commonwealth’s
first expert in patents and trade-marks law
and practice, and he represented N. S. Wales
at the Patents Convention that ushered in
Federation. But books have always meant
more than anything else to him —and par-
ticularly law books—and the A.-G.’s library
contains a collection of Reports dating back
to the sixteenth century. So he found happi-
ness there. He retires from his job as
librarian in three years, and the High Court,
whose stand-by. he is when it visits the
library (which is. every time it visits Syd-
ney), will miss him as much as any.
TOWN AND COUNTRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
’Twas when I built my life again
And came here to the city,
You said, “You’ll find it gayer far
And very near as pretty.
Although the soil is not so red, yet there are
gardens here,” you said;
“You will forget how strong and fair
And tall your country roses were.’’
I know I’m very fortunate
To have a city garden.
My struggling roses do their best;
And yet—l ask your pardon—
My memory is far too good: I still see how
the others stood,
How sweet and full they used to tower
As if they could not choose but flower.
These buds, poor dears, are pale and thin,
And so’s the food men sell us.
Our Jersey cow gave milk that could
Have made their best cream jealous.
I’ll not deny it —where’s the sepsef Town’s
good, but with a difference.
I shall not bow the knee, not I,
And found my pleasure on a lie.
For there are lovely things enough
I hardly had expected,
Like shiny pavements after rain,
With yellow lights reflected.
The silks in town are brighter far than many
kinds of tulips are;
And oh, the distant city light
A-bloom upon the purple night!
Yes, when I built my life again
I left some pieces lying
That wouldn’t fit into the plan,
For all my earnest trying.
1 won’t pretend I have forgot or that they’re
here, for they are not.
I’ll keep my memories sharp, like knives,
And thus enjoy two separate lives.

“Feather”: Notwithstanding “C. Coral”
(B. JO/4/’24), whose Torres Strait divers descend to
4 0 and 50 fathoms, here at Broome (W.A.), where
75 per cent, of the world’s pearlshell is fished, divers
seldom go down deeper than 25 fathoms, and practi-
cally never over 30, which is considered extremely
dangerous. In my experience of dress divers (a
long one) I never knew one who worked over
20 fathoms and did not suffer severe agonies at
times w'ith a form of rheumatic or partial paralysis,
known as “half-caste,” and that after all pre-
cautions had been taken, such as staging and smother-
ing their bodies with vaseline, embrocation, etc.,
before entering the dress. For the past 10 years
an average of five or six divers have been lost each
year through deep-water working (i.e., over 20
fathoms), but previous to that —before they learnt
the art of staging—the death-roll was nearer 40
per year. Taking a mean, hand-pump divers work
up to 14 fathoms and engine-pump divers from 12
to 25 fathoms. Perhaps the density of the water
lias enabled the Torres Strait divers to go down
deeper than ours —it may be heavier here than
there—but, anyhow, there is a deuce of a difference
in the figures, and the man who goes down to the
depths indicated by “C. Coral” either is a fool
or is trying a new fashion in hara-kiri. Inciden-
tally, a diver of mine one morning, a couple of years
ago, was suffering with severe pains in his ears,
so after breakfast at 7.30 he took the oilcan and
projected pump-oil into them. (“Number one medi-
cine,” he said.) He immediately went below and
remained under water until lunch-time (11 a.m.).
As his ears were still bad then, he inserted some
more pump-oil, and at 11.30 went down again. He
remained there until just after 6 p.m., being six and
a half hours under water without once appearing
or. the surface. Of course, we were working in four
to six fathoms only, and the shell was sent up at
intervals by an attachment to the lifeline. Still,
X think it constitutes a record as far as remaining
under water is concerned.
* * * *
“T.L.A.” : The talk had been mostly about
camp horses, and Old Dan at last chipped in. “Once
we were takin’ a mob of Territory bullocks to New
South, and the boss ’ad a ’orse ’e called Brandy.
That prad beat the bloomin’ band. Talk about horse
sense—’e had ’ogs’eads of it! We never ’ad to
watch the cattle at night—Brandy did that. I
believe the cattle ’ad a whole ’eap of respect for
that neddy. Well, one morning—it was near Armi-
dale —we finds a dead bullock on the camp. Its
’ead was all smashed in. Brandy ’ad kicked it to
death.” “I suppose it had been straying from the
mob?” remarked a drover. “No,” drawled Dan, “it
was a strange bullock.”
* * * *
“Colub”: There is a good chance of the
bite of any sort of spider being poisonous, not so
much because of the venom injected as from a septic
infection by the poison apparatus. I have seen bites
from the small green variety, mentioned by
“Hamer” (B. 3/7/’24), which were followed by un-
mistakable poisoning, and in one case the patient’s
arm was only just saved. But the symptoms were
those of septicaemia and toxaemia rather than those
produced by the action of venom. For this reason
the bites of all spiders should be treated instantly,
and the ordinary precautions taken to guard against
septic infection.
* * * *
“F.T.C.”: Talking of holocausts among
fish (B. 12/6/’24). On the last trip of the Karoola
from Westralia to Sydney before the strike lay-up,
she passed a dead leather-jacket every few dozen
yards after rounding Gabo. The slaughter resulting
from the submarine disturbance, or whatever it was,
must have run into millions, as the graveyard extended
for a three-hours’ journey of a 15-knot boat.
* * * *
“Gill Guy” : Re “F. Clinton” (B. 24/7/’24)
on drought-stricken sheep using the Monaro country
and the various troubles that attack them. I have used
all the roads-used by sheep on these journeys between
the Murray and the Murrumbidgee, and I know what
knocks all the diseases and pests into a cocked hat
as a sheep-killer—the roads between railhead and
the snow-lease country as at present used by drovers.
These commit the murder of countless
thousands of weak sheep—sufficient
in value to have built half a dozen
light railways into this lovely summer
tableland country. The handling of
this vastly important job of using the
Monaro plains to relieve drought-
stricken stock is a hideous example
of crass stupidity, ignorance and care-
lessness. Here’s an example. Sheep
untrucked at Tumbarumba (2200 ft.
above sea level), making for pastures
somewhere about the 4000 ft. level,
start by wandering a steady down-
ward track to the Murray, 1200 ft.
below Tumbarumba. Get a good hold
of that fact —it’s been going on for
many years. Here they cross the
Greg Greg River and start the 3000 ft.
climb over 30 or 40 miles of rough,
barren forest land. One famous climb
—-the Yellow Boy—means 1100 ft. in
about 11- mile. The Kiddles, of Cara-
bost, established a world’s record by
once crossing this in a buggy. There
are Hell Holes, Devil’s Slips and
places where the dogs can’t stand;
then when a block occurs you scramble
over to the lead and find the Toolong
River in a raging flood. The blowflies
and crows, just out of pure decency,
keep away from here —they can't stand
the suggestion of rubbing it in. From
Tumut side it is nearly as bad; stock
are driven over barren tops 500 and
600 feet high, apparently merely for the misery of
dropping down the other side.

“Wessel”: Does the wedge-tailed eagle
often make a meal off crow? On a recent trip to
Mungeranie, in the Cooper’s Creek country (S.A.),
Brooke Nicholls, a Melbourne ornithologist, saw' an
eagle pluck the feathers off a crow which it had
just caught, and eat it. All that W'as left after
dinner were the beak, the backbone and one of the
feet. Incidentally, Nicholls found ’possums living
in rabbit-burrows along the Cooper, and investiga-
tion disclosed a very curious reason. The galahs
which nest in thousands in the hollow trees drive out
the ’possums, and they are forced to take refuge in
the burrows. p*

high, wears a silver-grey overcoat and a beautiful
soft white vest with peculiar flaps down the sides
somewhat similar to the
lapels on a dinner-
jacket. His tail, the
biggest portion of him,
is clothed with thick,
fine fur, and, as be-
comes such an aristo-
crat, he carries the
handle at a very sporty
angle. The tmy animal
is, I believe, the most
affectionate pet in all
the Australian bush
His diet is very dainty,
for as your guest he
will accept only a
thinly-sliced “lady’s
finger” spread thickly
with butter and honey.
He always conveys his
thanks with a gentle
“Wee-wee, wee-wee,”
and if you are handling
him he will tenderly
rub his nose under your
chin. One little fellow
became so attached to
a big mate of mine that
he finally insisted on
accompanying him to
work. He cried piti-
fully with his tiny
“Wee-wee” the first
day when the big fel-
low' gently but firmly
locked him in a card-
board box padded with
wool. After an indiff
erent hour’s work my
mate slung down the
pick and strode back to
camp a mile away
through the timber. He
returned in half an
hour wearing a sheepish
grin, and through the
open neck of his flan-
nel there showed a
comical little nose, two
very bright eyes and
inquisitive ears, while
a tiny voice broad-
casted a cheery “Wee-
wee, wee-wee” to the sunny bush in general.
“The Jumper”: “Ragar” asked a while
ago where termites get the necessary moisture to
work their building material during drought. Well,
I’ve spent all my life in the bush and I’ve never
seen white ants do any building beyond repairing
minor breaches when drought held sway. In the
great parch of 1902 I burst dozens of white ants’
nests to permit starving birds to feed on the ter-
mites ; but in not one instance were repairs effected
till the drought had well broken. If “Ragar” had
really studied the white ant he would have noticed
the “necessary moisture” is emitted from the insect’s
mouth, the fluid being a milky, sticky substance
which can be exuded at will, and of which the ants
appear to have a liberal supply only when the
ground is water-soaked, particularly during the wet
summer months when most building work is carried
out.
* * * »
“D.S.”: My husband and I have had a
great argument to-day, and this is the point of
contention. When I was on the north-western plains
of N.S.W., I was out hunting with a party from
Curragundi station, when one man rode down a huge
red kangaroo. The animal bailed up, when his
pursuer was within 10 yards of him, made a bound
at the horseman and tore him from the saddle. A
boy and I rushed up, and, armed with sticks, we
managed to stay the attack until the other riders
came upon the scene and killed the ’roo. My point
is that no matter how good the rider is, or how
fleet his mount, he is always subject to attack .by
the ’roo once he bails up. My husband declares that
it is a very rare occurrence, and a man must be
a very poor horseman to allow such a thing. What
has the Abo. Council got to say about it?
“Te W.” : Several of our cuckoos —includ-
ing the channel-bill (stormbird) or giant cuckoo,
and the pallid cuckoo (brain-fever-bird) —are migra-
tory in habit, and so also is the European cuckoo,
which disappears during winter from England and
other more northerly parts of Europe. No such
fiction has wound itself aroimd our cuckoos, but in
the seventeenth century it was firmly believed even
by such accepted authorities as Francis Willughby
that the cuckoo sometimes crept into holes in
trees and there hibernated. The old naturalist afore-
said has a story of a large willow log being placed
upon a winter fire, from which as the heat began to
take effect came a muffled call —“Cuckoo, cuckoo!”
The log was taken off the fire and in a hollow was
found a cuckoo almost destitute of feathers. Some
time ago, by the way, a controversy arose as to the
European cuckoo having been heard calling in Aus-
tralia ; but as far as I know, the only sound of the
kind anyone has ever heard here has come from
quaint and queerly built clocks. Our birds, of
course, include a large assortment of cuckoos, the
rearing of whose parasitical offspring annually costs
the lives of hundreds of the young of many useful
birds; but none of them have the traditional call
of the northern hemisphere.
“Rcka”: Re strange friendships in the
bush (“Moe,” B. 10/7/’24). A well-known ease is
that of the mutton-bird and the tuatara-lizard in
Maoriland. On the Hen and Chicken Islands, off
the Auckland coast, I discovered that the bird and
the reptile fraternised and apparently lived together

COHEN: “My poy, take it from me, it’s more than reasonable.”
most amiably. The mutton-bird makes the burrow
in the cliff and takes the tuatara as a boarder.
This lizard, by the way, is the slowest thing imagin-
able. I once dug into a burrow and found one
with his head slightly turned aside and a general
air of surprise about him. A week later he was
still there in exactly the same position, even to
the surprised air, and in a fortnight the only per-
ceptible movement he had made was to turn his
head a little straighter. I had to leave then, but
a naturalist tpld me later it would probably take
him a month to get entirely straight.

“The Old Chook” : Re “Axliolme” on grape-
picking records (B. 26/6/’24). Here at Watervale
(S.A.) we pick into petrol-tin buckets, carry them
out to the waggon and tip them. At the most a
case holds only 2J buckets, and last season H.
Baker and J. Smith picked respectively 263 and 259
buckets and carried them out in a day. Smith

RED CLIFF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Grim and grisly a shanty stands
Where the red cliff fronts the sea,
Like a weird old witch with haggard hands
Beckoning wickedly.
From the lonesome bush and the ocean drear
Hunters and fishers venture near,
For Bertha is glad to make good cheer
Where the red cliff fronts the sea.
With her dour old man lives Bertha there
Where the red cliff fronts the sea,
A Viking’s daughter, tall and fair,
Bold as the waves, and free.
From her window shines a red lamp light,
And Bertha waits for a ship in sight,
Or a horseman riding through the night
Where the red cliff fronts the sea.
It’s good when a jolly boat conies in
Where the red cliff fronts the sea,
For Bertha loves men’s rousing din,
Their laugh and jollity.
And subtler far is her loosened hair
Than a fisher’s net or a hunter’s snare
To take her prey all unaware
Where the red cliff fronts the sea.
At the mustering there comes a change,
Where the red cliff fronts the sea;
Young cattlemen, who ride the range,
Are full of devilry.
Dick had his fling, but he could not stay,
And time flew on to their parting day,
When Bertha watched him ride away
Where the red cliff fronts the sea.
Lone was the bush and the ocean then
Where the red cliff fronts the sea;
But Bertha watched for sailor men,
A sailor’s girl was she.
Big Hans would dance and shake the floor,
But his boat one night was washed ashore,
And blue-eyed Hans came back no more
Where the red cliff fronts the sea.
A shanty stands on a headland high
Where the red cliff fronts the sea,
And bushmen and sailormen come by
For love and revelry.
And when a gleaming moon uncovers
Tiie tracks of bush or ocean rovers,
Bertha rides forth to find her lovers
AVhere the red cliff fronts the sea.

“W.G.A.” : A local identity who talks with
an accent that is not Italian was riding home from
the town when his horse propped and threw him
over its head on to the road. I came along, caught
the prad for him and helped him back into the

“Ringtail”: How is this for horse sense?
A friend of mine bought a milk-round in a Mel-
bourne suburb recently, and there went with it an
open stable which had an electric light attached to
the wall to light up both stable and yard. Every
morning early the light was found switched on, and
the boss blamed the men for forgetting to turn it
off. The men pleaded not guilty, and decided to
"AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND'S STUDY!”
watch. Armed with a pitchfork and pick-handle
they lay in wait for the culprit. About 1 a.m. they
saw one of the horses come out of the stable, run
his nose up the wall and switch the light on. He
then crossed the yard, had a drink and a roll,
surveyed the scenery for a while, and finally mooched
back to the stable.

would pilot you over. He knew exactly Where
there was a bit of high ground on which he could
stand for a breather; having had his spell, on he
would go. On Saturday the shearers and rouse-
ibouts would board the boat and go over to town,
and I have seen a boatload of drunks in charge of
Roany returning late on a pitch-dark night, and
landed safely home. I crossed in the biggest flood
known on this river, and knew I was all right
with the old prad as a pilot. He had followed
this game for 15 years, but when the big drought
was on the poor chap who had done such yeoma n
service died —of a broken heart, it seemed to me.
SETTING PA A PROBLEM
HELEN (who has keen pestering father with questions): “What do you do at the office
all day?”
FATHER : “Oh, nothing, nothing, child!”
HELEN: “How do you know when you arc finished , daddy?
“Fana” : Not long ago in Western N.S.W.
there was found a litter of wild pups which seem
to bear traces of a mixed fox and dingo ancestry.
The predominant strain is clearly that of the dingo,
but they have many unmistakable characteristics of
the fox, and a local zoologist who examined some
hair from their coats with a microscope reports that
its structure differs from that of either animal,
though it suggests dingo more than fox. The heals
of the pups, however, are typically vulpine, and their
tails have a leaning in the same direction. I have
never heard of interbreeding between dingo and fox,
and from the biological viewpoint such an event
does not seem feasible; still, stranger things have
bccurred.
* * * *
I reluctantly shot one of our
best draught-horses last week —a noble-looking ani-
mal and a splendid puller. His only fault —unforgiv-
able on a sheep station —was his taste for mutton.
Once he was left out in a paddock
for about three weeks with 2000
ewes and lambs, and in that time
he killed over 30 ewes. He would
race after a sheep with his ears
back and head nearly on the
ground, and when he caught up
he would grab his victim in the
middle of the back and toss her
high in the air and then smash
her on the ground, after which he
would calmly proceed to eat the
ghastly mess. We tried keeping
him in a small paddock, but the
goats used to wander through, and
frequently one of the herd would
be either missing or horribly muti-
lated. The carnivorous freak ran
a kangaroo once, but failed to
catch it. I often wondered what
chance a man would have if he
suddenly decided to try human
flesh. Does the Council know of
any other equine dingo?
* * *
“Gouger” : Is it any won-
der we’re asking for a new State
up north in N. S. Wales? An
inspector was required to furnish
a report, through a country Lands
Office, on the number of stock on
a returned soldier’s holding. The
inspector enumerated in his report
so many forward springing heifers,
so many backward springing heifers. The document
duly came back with this indignant commentary
accross it: “The inspector should refrain from making
facetious remarks.” Evidently the idea of a heifer
springing backwards had been too much for the
Sydney office to swallow.
* * * *
“Gotigor” : “Moo” (R. 10/7/'24) need not
go to America to find snakes living in harmony with
Brer Rabbit. Almost every Australian burrow shel-
ters its creeping boarders; also boarders that are far
more dangerous to bunny than the snake, viz., domes-
ticated cats. Some burrows also keep the damp off
porcupines, lizards, giant spiders, centipedes and
several species of birds with dark habits. The cats
and reptiles apparently live on friendly terms with
their landlords and pay their rent on the entente
system, the understanding being that they must
dine only on the baby rabbits of other burrows.
It is the principle on which more than one nation
has been compelled to buy dear peace and uneasy
security.
* * * *
“Sir Spcn” : When a chap named Andrews
was crossing Weaver’s Creek (Q.) at a point where
it meets Daintree-road one night recently, he had
an experience he won’t forget in a hurry. His
horse had to swim part of the creek, and just as
it landed on the opposite side a crocodile made a
snap and tore a stirrup-iron off. Tlfe horse gave
a plunge, and Andrews fell square on the neck of
the croc. The croc., however, concentrated his atten-
tion on the horse. Both man and horse got safely
away, but the horse was badly ripped. It seems
as though a croc.’s choice in Hunting is sometimes
guided by the size of the game,
* * * *
“J.H.S.” : Five babies at one time is cer-
tainly one over the odds even for Mrs. ’Possum,
whose usual allotment is two, although she often
nurses three and occasionally four. I’ve never come
across a lady of the ringtail tribe with more than
a quartette in the cradle at an}' time, nor heard or
such a happening. The good mother cited by “Capta’
(B. 12/6/*24) must have been fitted with an extra
drinking fount to make the feat possible.
* * * *
“Machete” : “Gouger’s” cat which fell 80ft.
(B. 3/7/ ’24) does not hold the record. About Id
months ago the caretaker's cat at Somerset House,
Martin-place, Sydney, fell down the lift well from
the roof, going through a wire-netted skylight on
the way. The only unpleasant consequence was
some advertisement in the afternoon press, which was
short of murders and divorces that day. As to other
animals, near Eland’s Nek, on the Swazi border,
during the South African War I watched some
Munster Fusiliers who had been told off to destroy
about 1000 sheep, following the amiable practice of
the later days of the war of destroying all possible
means of sustenance for the enemy. Throat-cutting
soon palled, so the disgusted sub. in charge got his
party to urge the jumbueks over some cliffs to
the "rocks, at least 150 ft. below. After the dive
ihost of the sheep were apparently unharmed, and,
scrambling over their injured brethren, cleared out.
There seemed to be as many casualties among the
latecomers who fell on their cobbers as among the
first lot to hit. the rocks.
* * * *
“Alpha”: How is this for the Queer Acci-
dent Stakes? A boundary-rider employed on Bibben-
luke station (N.S.W.), while mustering cattle a few
days ago. was riding a young horse which threw its
head up sharply and struck its rider with the
“spur” of the bit across his throat. A long, deep
gash w T as inflicted, from which the blood poured
freely, necessitating a hurried trip to the nearest
medical man, who had to put in several stitches.
* * * *
“Tomb” : At church the other night I heard
the parson, in reading an extract from the Bible,
refer to the “rams and the he-goats,” and this set
me wondering if poor old Stinker ever had a dis-
tinctive name all to himself like the males of most
other animals. “Billygoat” seems to be too patently
Australian, and I have never heard him called any-
thing else —at TFast politely. Is there a universal
cognomen for him the same as we have for his less
aromatic cobbers ?
* * * *
“FY7”: Re “Kurrajong’s” statement (B.
3/7/’24) that few abos. from the interior can swim.
I can’t be positive about the nigs of the Nullarbor
Plain or of Centralia, but the many I have met
from Thursday Island to Muhgindi and from the
Barrier Reef to the Diamentina could swim like
ducks. I learned to swim from the blacks on the
Upper Barcoo, which, in those days at least, was
well in the interior. For years, too, fierce con-
troversy raged as to whether the Australian origina-
tors of the crawl stroke hadn’t cribbed their idea*
from the abos. 1 put down Binghi's abstention
from public* swimming as contrasted with pedestrian-
ism to the fact that swimming baths are found only
in the bigger cities and towns, whereas a track for
a sprint is available in any bush township or at
any bush pub. Further, there is little money in
processional swimming anywhere, whereas there is
whips of it in pro. running—for the white gentle-
men who invariably watch over Binghi’s destinies in
this branc h of “sport.”
* * * *
“Basso”: At Sorrento (Vie.) the other
day I came ac l oss a group of kiddies down on
their knees. : nd 1 stopped to see what was toward.
They had found a spider’s hole in the ground, and
were engaged in catching a bull-ant with which
they said they were going to “ferret” out the spider.
Having captured the ant, they forced it into the
hole. Several seconds passed; then out came the
spider in a hurry, with the “ferret” hanging on
tenaciously in the rear. Once in the open the spider
commenced his defence, and a combat, thrilling to
the young heathens, ensued. The ant never once
looked like a loser. If he ever let go with his
long mandibles it was only to gain a better hold;
while the spider struggled furiously, many times
lifting the bulldog right off the ground. The fight
lasted about a minute and a half, with all the honors
to the ant.
* * * »
“Pick”: Gregarious wild birds when tra-
velling far habitually adopt peculiar flight forma-
tions. with a recognised leader. Swans, pelicans
and ibises fall into a V, with the head gander at
the- apex, and each member a few wing-flaps out-
ward and to the rear of his fellow. By voice the
leader signals any change of speed or direction.
When weary of making the pace he gives place to
his second in command. Gillbirds and tallawongs
travel in long, straggling lines. A tallawong exodus,
with the incessant musical calling of the winged
tourists, is a bush pleasure never to be forgotten.
Cockatoos and galahs fly an irregular course, with
apparently no pre-arranged direction. But they
zig-zag, wheel, ascend and descend with machine-
like precision, and no bird in the clustered mass ever
gets in the way of another. Their constant screech-
ing is doubtless hasty advice to “Keep over there,
blow you!” Parrot tribes fly as though skimming
the waves of the sea. With their constant undula-
tory, darting movement they have often proved the
trickiest of all bush birds to shoot on the wing.
Pigeons clap their wing-feathers with a whir when
rising for flight, and then go off silently, but with
tremendous velocity. Wild ducks journey in loose
order, but every bird has his mate alongside, to
whom he chortles in affectionate quacks.
a * * *
“TakuTua”: Snaring the weka, Maori
fashion, is sport of a kind. From the thin end of
a light stick about sft. long hang a bunch of
feathers, a dead bird or a piece of red rag, and
from the end of another stick a flax noose. Hold
the first in the left hand, and the second in the
right, with the noose open about a foot in advance
of the bait. Crouch down, keep quiet, and shake
the bait to attract the weka’s attention. As soon
as he sees it he makes a direct rush, and as soon
as his head goes through the noose you simply hoist
him into the air. If you fail to get his neck in the
ORPHANS.
FATHER FLYNN: “Why don't you try a hit
of hard work instead of begging about
the place like this?"
WEARY WIGGINS: “Well, your ririrince , me
and me mate here useter keep trained
mice. But last year they died on us”
noose, he will give you a tug of war for the bait.
It’s all rot about the weka being “impossible for
the larder,” as stated by Marriot Watson in “The
Web of the Spider.” Boil him first, skim off the
oil —which has many uses—and then roast. It’s
not up to pigeon, but is much better than rabbit.
THE SUNSET’S HANDY MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
He trudges into sunset glow,
His swag upon his back;
Where’er the beaten highways go,
Or path or bridle track,
He walks his way with measured tread,
Confronting wind and sun;
Me makes his bed
Where plains are spread
And magic dawns are spun.
Where never foot has left its mark
The spirit urges him ;
He takes joy in his kelpie’s bark,
And loud his morning hymn
The magpie carols from a tree.
He owns not pot nor pan;
His chop broils he,
Content to be
The Sunset’s handy man.
The roads he builded years ago
Across the desert wide
He treads with practised step and slow,
And knows a certain pride
In effort and accomplishment.
’Twas but the other day
His hammer rent
The rock, his tent
Was pitched beside the way.
He digs the dams, he shears the sheep ;
When harvest comes again
He takes the track and helps to reap
The Cocky’s scanty grain.
He blazes tracks to Furthest Out,
And never may he stay,
The leader stout,
The foremost scout,
The breaker of the way.
He is the finder of the fords,
He s< ales the ranges high,
Where presently earth’s overlords
Will blithely pass him by.
A good stout pair of boots has he,
A nosebag and a can.
Give three times three
In cheers for the
Australian handy nun!
VICTORIA.

The flapper brigade is singing a Hymn
of Hate to our fashion dictators across-seas.
The poor dears have sacrificed their Buster
Brown crops to the even more costly shingle,
only to 'be faced with the horrid fact that
feminine crops of any variety are no longer
being cultivated in London and Paris. All
the scissorings have to make way for piled-up
locks, reinforced by early-Victorian ringlets
bobbing flirtatiously about the ears—the
ringlets that were known to irreverent youth
of the ’seventies as Maiden Auntie curls.
Our smartest “tonsorial artists” are fever-
ishly buying up all the switches and curly
jocks they can lay hands on. And with the
crop we will farewell the little pull-on hat,
which we now tuck our heads into so cosily.
Alas and alack! wide Picture brims and
Steeple crowns, with the deadly anchoring
hatpin, now cast their shadows before us.
Mrs. H. J. Robertson, who at the whole-
hearted request of her committee sisters has
just agreed to remain in the chair of the
Women’s Automobile Club, staged an at-
ome in the rooms the other afternoon, at
which musical and other items flowed from
the instruments and voices of Cecil Parkes,
Norma Currey, T. (A. I\. Voight, Sibyl
Fraser and Harold Rodgers. Mrs. Robert-
son defied the cold breeze with an encom-
passing musquash coat over inky marocain,
and topped off with a black velvet hat. The
programme was sliced in halves by a tea-
drinking ceremony. Included in the large
and cheerful gathering were the J. W. Reid,
Felix Lloyd, Springthorpe, C. Moore and
Gaze matrons, singer Dorothy Murdoch and
Bertha Collin.
The Western District Currie clan has been
plunged into mourning by the death of Sib-
bald, the youngest of the four wool-growing
brothers, who passed out at his homestead,
Ettrick, after a brief illness. He was the
fifth son of the late J. L. Currie, one of Vic-
toria’s pioneer pastoralists, and originally
set out on a legal career; but after he had
qualified as a barrister the call of the land
was too strong for him. Always retiring, he
bad at 58 become rather a recluse, and for
some years had given much time to the collec-
tion of gems and curios. Many messages of
sympathy have gone to the widow, who has
been in England during the past few months
for the marriage of the elder daughter, and
had been preparing for the return voyage
with the younger girl, Norah, early in Sep-
tember.
The two-year-old Repertory Dramatic
School, which, under Norman Simpson, is
doing excellent work without making much
noise about it, had the St. Mary’s Hall, Dan-
denong-road, the other night for its term-
end production, Jennings’s “Young Person
in Pink,” with Brighouse’s “The Price of
Goal” as a curtain-raiser. In the main
piece the performance was well up to Reper-
tory standard, but the curtain-raising item
called for too big a dramatic effort for bud
ding genius. Elizabeth Woodyatt was the
.voung person in pink, Mamie Bennett a
society matron, Frank Lnnie juvenile lead
and Myrna Badgott a crafty old balloon-
seller. Dozens of the Very Best damsels
have linked with the school and get some
culture and a lot of fun from the venture.
Mrs. E. V. Richardson’s denunciation of
slang and snobbishness in Melbourne’s lead
ing girls’ schools stirred up no storm of pro-
test from irate parents and pedagogues—
maybe because so many fathers and .mothers
have been saying exactly the same thing
themselves. In certain fashionable semi-
naries girls who can boast of au expensive
wardrobe, not to mention a parental limou-
sine, are always regarded as superior to their
less well-dowered schoolfellows. Even our
leading boys’ schools are not free from taint.
One youth lately went so far as to request
his father, a leading city merchant, on no
account to call at the school in his Ford,
hut to come in a taxi, which might at least
unply that the family Rolls Royce was tem-
porarily out of action.* And many school-
boys insist on having taxis from the station
on returning to college each term, as a cab
or a tram puts one on such an inferior foot-
ing don’t-cher-know! As to slang, a nice
I'ttle inter-State flapper returned home after
lour months in a Melbourne seminary such
■l superior young person, and so loaded up
vith latter-day slang and idiom, that her
ustounded parents hardly recognised their
own offspring. Another young miss in her
early teens had a postscript to her first home
letter: “Don’t mind bad riting—this pen kicks
like hell.”
The Nyulasys’ Toorak parlors provided a
pleasant setting for the musical afternoon
promoted by Mrs. Gilbert Lodge and Laura
Nyulasy to help the finances of St. Martin’s
Boys’ Home. Mrs. Lodge secreted navy
tailorings under a fur coat de luxe, and flew
a small black satin hat, while Miss Nyulasy
headed misty black hangings with a little
toque spiked round the rim with o
ostrich feathers. Golden-headed Patricia
Lodge and her tiny, olive-skinned sister
Judith, hawking beribboned baskets spilling
over with flowery stock, provided a charming
study in contrasts. A pound-note hidden in
a box of chocs, was raffled for the cause. The
musical menu was professionally weighted
by Dorothy Murdoch and Maggie Jervis.
Dorothy’s lovely warble, which got its piano
backing from Yvonne Deschamps, rang out
in several soul-disturbing numbers; but her
special-request item, “Three Fishers,” while
drawing tears from the eyes of the crowd,
was disturbed by chatterers. Dulcie Bland,
Marjorie Ansell, Judge Williams’s daughter
Ainslie, Phyllis Best and Mrs. Hale Morris
filled out the programme. In the middle of
it someone remembered that it was the 10th
anniversary of the opening of the Great War,
and in a burst of patriotic fervor got Yvonne
Deschamps to play Godsave. The bewildered
crowd promptly prepared to depart, and
only a breathless explanation saved an
exodus.
A leading Melbourne citizen tells of the
days when his young life was darkened by
the constant striving to make a healthy appe-
tite balance with a meagre income. One
lucky day he lighted on a cafg where a juicy
steak, chipped potatoes, rolls and butter
were offered at one shilling, and he promptly
became a regular and enthusiastic customer.
Soon he introduced a brace of hard-up pals to
his find. As the trio chatted cheerily to-
gether, warmed by the anticipatory pleasure
of a satisfying meal, the voice of the yell-
ing waiter to the cook smote their ears:
“Three steaks and chips; and hurry up—
it’s the er—gentleman who finishes all the
rolls and butter!”
The Sailors’ Wives and Mothers’ Friendly
Union had an afternoon out at the Indepen-
dent Hall on August 7, with tea and talk and
a musical programme provided by Mrs. Gayer
Phipps, a John Grice daughter, Judge Wil-
liams’s daughter and Mrs. E. Collins. Ad-
miral Hall Thompson’s wife presided over
the affair, and the Bracegirdle and Cresswell
matrons were among the Union committee
workers to hand round the cakes.
The previous day saw the Soldiers’ Union
spree, at which the news was broadcasted
by Mrs. Sellheim that one member and her
daughter-in-law, both widowed by the war,
had saved up £3OO to pay for a pilgrimage
to their husbands’ graves in France. They
are expected to be the first of quite a num-
ber of the Union’s mothers and widows to
make the sad journey. The Chauvel lady was
in the chair, and the proceedings were bright-
ened by a musical menu which had been
arranged by Theophilus Roberts.
Few women have allied themselves more
closely with charitable movements than the
wife of ex-Attorney-General Arthur Robin-
son. She contracted the alliance in her
early girlhood
long before
she changed
her name from
Buckle to Rob-
inson, and
although ill-
health com
polled her to
close down on
all committee
activities a
few years
back, she is
always ready
to lend a hand
in a good
cause. The
first love of
her committee
days was tin
Time and Tal-
ents Society,
which has put
up a long re-
cord of charitable endeavor, and of which
she was vice-president. She was formerly
a pillar of the Women’s League, and for two
and a half years edited the official organ,
reluctantly vacating the editorial chair on
her husband’s accession to State Ministerial
office. The political knight and his wife
have now crossed to Sydney for a short
golfing holiday at Rose Bay before taking
a tonic of Blue Mountain air. They will
collect their one ewe lamb, Nancy, in Sydney
on her return from a Queensland trip, and
bring her back with them to Melbourne.
Mrs. Fritz Hart called a group of femin-
ine inky-wayfarers into the Lyceum Club the
other afternoon to drink tea and welcome
Lilian Stott back to Melbourne. The Con.-
singing bird has been revelling in a year
of Europe under the wing of Mary Campbell,
who kept up the girl’s vocal training as
they went. And there were lessons, too,
from that master of interpretation, Plunkett
Greene. Before loading her grip for the
return voyage the young Australian let Lon-
don hear her beautifully poised soprano at a
recital in the Wigmore Hall, and the critics
said nice things about it. The Stott voice
had its baptism at a Yerbrugghen concert
in 1921 and we are to have an early chance
of judging it on its new form.

C. W. Wren, Australian chief of the E., S.
and A Bank, and Branch-Inspector Hobart
blew into the Ormond Hall with their wives
on Thursday night to smile on the jazz and
jollity which wound up the social season of
the Bank’s social club. Mrs. Wren sported
black charmeuse and Mrs. Hobart suggested
a golden sunset in corn-colored satin en-
meshed with gold lace.
A line or two from London :
The Maynard Hedstrom couple, of Suva, were re-
sponsible for one of the brightest gatherings so far
held at Wembley. It was staged, of course, in the
Fiji Court, which is hung about with paintings
showing the life and scenery of the islands. Sir
Cecil Rodwell, Governor of Fiji, and Sir Charles
Dawson and his lady (he was formerly Chief Jus-
tice in Fiji) were the big fish in the net, and among
other notables were Mr. Ehrhardt (one-time Attorney-
General of the group), the Ross couple (he was a
former Collector of Customs), Dr. Arnold (he used
to be medical officer at Lautoka) and Mrs. Swaine (her
husband was a magistrate). Mrs. Maguire amd daugh-
ter Eileen were also present, because father had been
M.O. of Suva’s hospital. Maorilanders present in-
cluded former High Commissioner Tammas McKenzie
and his daughter Mrs. A. V. McDonald. They were
specially interested, as some of the paintings of
the youngest McKenzie lass, Mrs. H. S. Ellis, of
Suva, hang in the Fiji Pavilion. The artistic Hellaby
couple, whose Fijian studies also adorn the walls,
were others at the party.
Mrs. Barry Thompson, who presides so
generously over the Alfred Hospital enter-
tainments committee, gathered her sister
committee-women and some others in the
Windsor Hotel’s cosy writing-room the other
afternoon for cheery chat and tea. The host-
ess smiled hospitably above a silken wash
of brown, and below an enviable velvet hat.
The committee's vice-president, Mrs. .Tames
Angus, attractively frocked in inky maro-
cain, hurried in betwen the cakes and ice-
cream from the Blind Asylum’s annual meet-
ing. Mrs. Bob Greig was there, glad to be
back for a hurried visit after several months
on tour with husband Robert. The latter
faced the thinning flutter of skirts at 5
o'clock to collect his other half, and had a
rousing reception. American Vice-Consul
Anderson’s wife —a charming Dane with an
intriguing Amurrican-Englisli accent —was
another non-committee guest, and the gather-
ing also included the Tom White, Hillyard,
Maeallum Neil, Teddy Dyson, Russell Jack-
son, E. Bolger, De Berigny and Russell Gabb
matrons.
The C. of E. Grammar Old Girls housed
their annual jazz in the St. Kilda Town
Hall, which they festooned with the school
colors, blue and gold. The supper tables,
too, gleamed with golden wattle and daffo-
dils, punctuated with blue cornflowers and
swaying balloons. The headmistress, Miss
Gilman Jones, was there to give the old
girls her blessing; and Mrs. Geoff Rawson
and Mrs. T. White (president and vice-pre-
sident) sat with her in the improvised parlor
at the end of the hall. Sighted in the crowd
were Mrs. Eric Gutteridge with her medical
husband, two Kent Hughes girls, a couple of
Symes, Jessie Bage, Dr. Marion Wanliss,
Mollie Leeper (daughter of the ex-Trinity
warden) and Mary Patterson. The two last-
named were the lion, secretaries.
The musical sensation of October will be
the first performance of Mona Mcßurney’s
opera, “The Dalmatians.” The story was
taken from Marion Crawford’s “Marietta,”
and the music is said to be both rich and
lyrical. The composer, who is the youngest
daughter of a well-known littevatcw , " <ls
born in the Isle of Man, and wrote an opera,
“Puck,” all by her little self at the age o!
seven. Since then she has been making music
of every kind, and some of it has brought
her into notice, both across-seas and in Aus-
tralia, where she has lived for years.
Mrs. Austin Wilson —she and her husband
dropped in from England some time back
on a business visit, and are hiring the Rupert
Greenes’ Toorak bungalow, Pemborley—-
beckoned in a contingent of the Rest Known
on Sunday afternoon to welcome her mascu-
line half. It was a bright little party, its
natural cheerfulness being further livened
by songs from George Chant, Millie Tree
Chapman and the hostess. The Robert Gar-
rans were among the invited, also the Barrett
lady, the Richard Lintons, Dr. Nyulasy and
sister Laura, ex-Senator Keating s wite, the
Rennie sisters, and so on.
A bridge-party at the Alex. Creswicks’
Toorak home will give a much-needed fillip
to the funds of the Chelsea Cottage-by-the-
Sea, which was lately launched by the Braille
Writers’ Association for blinded people in
need of a fresh-air tonic. The cards were
fluttered in the usual bazaar-like setting of
flower- and sweet-stalls. One section of
sweet brigands raffled a gorgeous theatre-bag,
various silk stockings and a juicy ham. The
tea was turned on in the dining-room, where
there was a dazzle of golden poppies.
Among those who helped to build up the
profits as bridge-players or brigands were
the Goulburn Brooke, Austin Wilson, T.
Luxton, Raynes Dickson, Askin Forster,
Fred Payne and Ernest Poolman matrons.
A travelling Australian lass went crazy
over a New York metropolitan prima-donna,
and every day for a week turned the song-
bird’s sitting-room into a bower. At length
the Diva condescended to her worshipper.
“Would you like to see me in ‘The Barber’?
she cooed. “Yes? Then do let me send
you two tickets.” The youngster was thrilled,
and for two days talked about the great
one’s sweetness. Then came the tiekets—-
two, not for the stalls, or the horseshoe,
but for a gallery. The cold douche did its
work, and a normal Australian girl emerged.
Taking up her gold fountain-pen she wrote:
“Dear Madame, —Thank you so much for
the tickets. The lift boys will be delighted
to use them.”
Another sort of a win for us! Sir Edward
Wild, Recorder of London, has been telling
Queensland Solicitor-General Webb that,
from his experience of mixed juries, women
are less sentimental than men, and more in-
clined to judge a case in cold and dispas-
sionate reason.
A little gossip from Adelaide:—
It has been a week of music—the fourth of the
S. Aus. Orchestra’s concerts, our own brand-new
Grand Opera Co. at the Town Hall and a violin re-
cital by Schilsky at the Con. All had bumper
houses, even though the orchestra collided with the
opening night of the opera. The Bridges went to
the latter show; so did the Mayoral Glovers and their
predecessors in office, the Cohens and Frank Moul-
dens ; likewise the Barwells and the Winsloe Halls. The
heroines of the opera, next to the conducting Coni
tessa, were Vera Thrush and Elsie Woolley, both of
them in admirable voice and displaying a fine
dramatic sense. Hilda Gill was the songstress at the
Schilsky concert, with Reimann, George Pearce and
Harold Wylde in succession at the piano.
The doctors and medical students of the Adelaide
Hospital gave a dance to the nurses in the gailv-
decorated dining-room of the Nurses’ Wing. The
Moulden dame was among the guests, likewise Mrs.
B. H. Morris and her doctor, matron Harrold, and
a sprinkling of older medicine-men.
Adelaide has been welcoming Hilda Felstead —it
still comes easier to call her that, though she’s now
Mrs. Flanders and has her captain-husband with her.
She went away singing through “the East’’ seven
years ago, and in India met an impetuous wooer who
won and wedded her in 17 days. His job is con-
trolling Bombay’s food supply.
The Symon dame said the opening piece at the
fair in Prospect’s new parish hall, which was built
by local Anglicans as their war memorial. The
speech preluded an afternoon’s brisk buying and sell-
ing, which added another £350 to the building fund.
The committee responsible for the Bowing Club
Ball decorations (the J. H. Gosse, Kenneth Milne,
Collier Cudmore and F. W. Porter matrons —all with
husbands who once pulled- mighty oars) achieved a
triumph in the way they ( ,ut the Osborne Hall into
a dazzling suit of the club’s colors —red, yellow and
black. A committee of a dozen or so rowing men
ran the show, and their feminine belongings paid
them the compliment of wearing ti>eir best fripperies
for it.
There was a Military Ball at the Palais on the
same evening (crossed swords and lances, machine-
guns and their larger brothers were tl.e decorations
there), to which went the Bridges, the Reginald
Bucklands, the O. V. Hoads and dozens VI dozens of
other prominent persons. There was also a deb. or
two, among them the C. F. Woodcocks’ daughter
Frances, in white georgette slightly draped and
caught with a brilliant clasp.
Dr. Cecil E. Tilley came home to see his parents
at Unley the other day. After proving himself a
brilliant scholar in Adelaide, he went to England five
years ago and concentrated on geological research,
incidentally becoming a Ph.D. of Cambridge. He will
go back there, probably to the geological department.

AWOMAN'S
LETTER

SILK GLOVES
Melba was the guest of the Feminists last
Friday. Their own, lair in the basement ol
Culwulla being too limited, they spread the
mid-day feast in the Cavalier. Hither came
literally hundreds of Feminists, some like
the wise virgins with their pass-in bright
and shining in their hands, others causing a
traffic jamb while they hunted through the
jungle of their bags for the elusive entry
card. Premier Fuller’s lady was one of the
early arrivals, and sat waiting for daughter
Gwen in the lounge, her tall two-decker black
satin millinery hobnobbing with the coquc
plumes in Grammar School Mrs. Dettman s
droopy headpiece. Club heads kept the
doors—Miss Preston-Stanley in navy-blue
apparel brave with terra-cotta back and. front
panels, topped by colorful snug millinery;
Mrs. Liddell her shoulders draped with a
scarf the shade of a golden plum; and Ruby
Rich, the cream of her skin made more
creamy by a close-fitting Frenchified hat in
dull gold. 1 Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who said the
opening piece, came in her Chinese effects of
embroidered coat and red hat. The Ameri-
can consular Mrs. Lawton was another early
comer; so was the knighted Waley’s lady,
whose erect figure gave distinction to a per-
fectly-cut black cloth top-coat. Another
notable was Dr. Mary Rocke, whose broad
shoulders carry most of the weight of the
amphitheatre at Balmoral. The guest her-
self, clear-skinned and smiling, arrived to
the minute, drawing in her wake Lady Helena
Rous and Mrs. George Armstrong. In addi-
tion to the eold and purple of the club that
shone in the wattle and violets on the other
tables, Melba’s place was adorned with a
lyre woven of the two blooms. But, alas, the
Feminists are strict prohibeetion, and the rule
wasn’t broken even to the extent of Chablis
for the guest of honor, who was nearly inar-
ticulate with bronchitis. With the ices came
the speeches: a litany in praise of the song-
bird from Mrs. Pitt Rivers, Miss. Preston-
Stanley and Mrs. Liddell. Ruby Rich drank
to a National Opera, and Minister for Edu-
cation Bruntnell, one of the few males
present, responded by turning the cold
shower of an impoverished Treasury on her
enthusiasm.
Before the fruit-cup of the Feminists had
digested, the lift at Stanway House shot
Melba up seven floors to where a Women’s
Club party awaited her in the assembly-
room. It awaited her with the buzz of
Patience seated on rows of tightly-wedged
chairs, knowing that, if it moved, eager and
standing Impatience would swoop upon the
resting-place. In the doorway, under a;
crimson sign demanding admission tickets or
money, stood the reception committee, in-
cluding club-secretary Miss Sutherland,
black-frocked, white-gloved and marcel-
waved, and Mrs. Vernon Cole, in summer-
sky blue marocain that flew a sort of trou-
badour cape effect, surmounted by a toque
with a white plume cascade. Elsie Dumolo,
just back from Europe, recited; and violin
solos were sandwiched between drinks —tea,
of course—in the sitting-room. Mrs. George
Armstrong and Lady Helena Rous supported
the diva.
On Friday the Women’s branch of the
Country party boiled the billy in its new
rooms in Bligh-street for the womankind of
those Farmers and Settlers who have been
deep in conference for the past week. The
rooms are two or three doors down from the
Royal Colonial Institute, and lack that estab-
lishment’s plutocratic atmosphere; but the
beax-ings of the lift ran red before the final
guest had stepped on to the hall linos. Mrs.
Earle Page, brown to the tips of her furs,
presided; and slim Mrs. Gunn went about
making everyone at home with a smile that
dimpled betwen a pork-pie neck-frill, and a
jaunty red hat. Mrs. Foster Mattei, from
Perth, spoke on Woman’s place in the scheme
of things, and a country visitor brought a
whiff of the Outback into the city, with tales
of the lure of the bush. The night before
the visitors drank a heady brew of song and
jazz provided for them by the same hostesses
in the Australian Hall.
The Royal Art Society had Acting-Chief
Justice Street to wish it many happy returns
on Saturday afternoon. The society’s un-
changing brown-and-gold cards had gone
forth liberally, and the result was a tremend-
ous muster at the Education Gallery. By
3 o’clock it was possible to glimpse the pic-
tures only by pushing relentlessly, and none
but the determined art-quaffer did it. As
usual at the Royal shows, there was such
a meeting and greeting of old friends, such
a gazing at the coming painter lads and
lasses, that one saw only enough to make
one want to see more another day. _ The
snapping eyes of Dattilo Rubbo dominated
the platform, run a close second by president
Lister Lister’s fine head. Charlie Bryant,
of the sea-brush, obscured himself, and B. E.
Minns caught an early North Shore train;
but James R. Jackson held court most of
the afternoon. He had brought his small
fiancde, her face nearly hidden under the
sweeping brim of a black hat. She shared
attention with Miss Goldsmith, the beautiful
model for Alfred Coffey’s three pastels, who,
fur-coated and small-hatted, took a hurried
glimpse at her own profile and full face, and
then fled. Tall water-colorist Grace avoided
the corner where his two reproductions of
“the finest view in the world” (it’s out be-
yond Prospect) hung, and spread his wing
over the young Birtles couple. ( He’s the
poet that a silly old Senate sent down from
the Uni. because of a set of verse that the
Uni. magazine had printed.) The dreamy-
eyed, gentle-mannered youth is busy bringing
out his first book of verse under the title of
“Black Poppies.” John Banks, whose “The
Way to. the Beach” has been bought by the
Gallery, showed a shining morning face, and
carried off a group of the prettiest girls to
tea —among them May Moore’s graceful first
lieutenant, a study in ivory and gold.
The Palais had a cheery night last week
when it housed a ball for the Sydney Hospi-
tal. As usual, the rafters of the Agricul-
tural Society’s ancestral hall were hidden
in a forest of gay streamers, among which
port and starboard lights shone with the
benevolent twinkle of those who, having
savored life, have neither prohibitions nor
inhibitions left, but whose gesture is a genial
“On with the dance!” That atmosphere
will tell cannot be denied: the' subtle influ-
ence of the Spanish-looking boxes about the
Palais landscape, with their effulgent can-
opies that might be enclosing toreadors and
senoritas, has worked like leaven through
layer after layer of Sydney womankind, and
at this dance culminated in a heavy crop of
Spanish combs and Spanish shawls. Mrs.
A. B. Shand, president of the revels, wrapped
her shoulders in a Carmenesque affair, rich
with embroideries and fringe. Sheila Simp-
son was another wearer of the bright wrap.
Surgeon McKelvey brought his lady in black
panne, Matron Kellett was a picture in
black softness, and medical-superintendent
Dr. Porter and assistant-superintendent Dr.
Winston were of the hundreds that kept the
band busy. Mrs. W. G. Conley had the plea-
sant job of treasurer.
The Artists’ Ball couldn’t happen without
a preliminary thrill. The committee has
discovered a plot! Some wicked persons have
issued false tickets and have been selling
them below par in the city. Such a thing
isn’t to be tolerated—it would mean over-
crowding, and the beer would never go round.
So the genuine tickets are being recalled, and
will be replaced by others of a fresh mintage
—or is it vintage? The combined Arts are
determined to keep the gathering 100 per cent,
pure. At a rally at the Australia last week
these things were discussed; furthermore
Gladys Owen disclosed the method of sharing
the spoils—lo per cent, to the J. G. William-
son Employees’ Benefit Fund, 10 per cent, to
incapacitated artists, and the rest towards
massaging the path of poor Art Studonls.
The attractive young woman here por-
trayed would pass for a twin-sister of Mamie
Watson. She
is Maureen
Foster, who
has been in-
structing the
more or less
gilded youth of
Sydney in the
mysteries of
the Blues and
other dances
of the 1923-24
vintage, an d
giving exhibi-
tions at Far-
mer’s. Her
instructor in
these fascinat-
ing means of
killing time
was Santos
Casani, a bird-
man who sus-
tained terrible
injuries in
France, but recovered sufficiently to become
the conductor of about the most prosperous
dancing-academy in London. In the process
of treatment the plastic surgeons had to re-
mould a countenance that had been wrecked
in the crash. The tall, graceful girl was
born in Perth. Her mother, who is with
her in Sydney, did a lot of newspaper work
in the West, and helped the Country party
on the platform.
Little Stella Power lured a group of
women into the foyer of the Lyceum pieture-
theatre the other afternoon, and there, in the
soothing glow of rosy lights, nourished them
with the amiable cream-puff while recount-
ing her saga since her last visit to Sydney.
While she retailed news of her triumphs and
her frocks, masses of Iceland poppies glowed
an accompaniment to the symphony of Stella s
plumage. The singing girl is as noted as
Evelyn Scotney for eye-arresting costumery,
and her guests beheld her in a melting con-
fection of cloth of silver into which a pleated
panel of shell-pink georgette had ingratiated
itself, while streaming pale-pink and blue
ribands finished off the toothsome effect.
Stella has found Sydney picture-goers as
appreciative and discerning as any of her
audiences. She will probably appear as
Micaela, the milkmaid whose high, sweet top-
notes are part of the charm of “Carmen,
before grand opera puts up its shutters in
Sydney.
You’ve heard lately of Charles Chauvel,
one of the Bananaland military-squatter clan,
now O.C. of Australian Film Productions, a
Brisbane co.,
which has
been well
backed and
hopes to divert
some of the
dollars from
the Yankee
movie - kings.
He gave up a
station rS 1 e
five years ago,
and put. in
some time
with local pro-
ducers. Then
followed two
years in
America,
where he went
through the
mill in sev-
eral of the
big studios,
and was for
a time under the wing of Fred Niblo
The unrivalled scenery of his native
State is to provide the setting for stories
of Australian outdoor life, and the good
quality of the scenarios that are offering
makes him very optimistic.
The Women Painters picked the eve of
the Royal Art Society’s show for their yearly
frivol, and because of the widening circle ot
art girls and their admirers, the Wentworth
was the rallying-point, instead of their own
rooms in Queen Victoria Buildings. The
strength of the Australian picture-market was
shown in the complete absence of arty
frocks • from her daubed overall every woman
emerged the effulgent butterfly she knows
herself to be. President Ethel Stephens wore
jetted georgettes, and draped herself in a scarf
like a Cairo sunset; treasurer Mrs. Mcßviliy
lifted her brand-new shingle above blue geor-
gettes that shone through thickly sown
opaque beads like blue sky through a thin
cloud; one side of secretary Mrs. Percy
Paget’s black panne had developed a carnival
spirit and inlaid itself with flame georgettes;
and Mrs. J. J. Talbot, who was chairwoman
of the committee, convened lilac ■ velvets and
floral georgettes.
Little Nellie Kelly tripped on to the stage
of the Opera House on Saturday afternoon
trailing clouds of glory. Mamie Watson, of
the blonde head and the gracefully-assembled
torso, was the popular Nellie, who burst on
Sydney in a whirl of silver lace, subdued in
her walking moments by an over-dress ot
forget-me-not blue marocain, the bodice made
on long straight lines carved closely to the
figure, and the skirt opening over a front
panel of metal lace, through which gleam
further deeps of palest pink-and-blue geor-
gettes. When in activity the whole confec-
tion becomes an iEtna of silver lace and rain-
bow-hued georgettes. The finishing touch
is a cape of silver lace with an old-rose foun-
dation. May Beatty appears first in ivory
georgette embroidered in black and flash-
ing with diamente, four narrow panels
lined with black forming the train.
With this remarkable dress is worn a
double-tiered tiara of black and silver and
a wonderful ostrich _ fan. June Roberts
wears her most striking dress in the third
act. The skirt of this is a lush growth of
silver and cerise fringe and the tight-fitting
top is of silver lame. Mannequins in gor-
geous apparel glide sinuously through the
production.
All Saints’, Woollahra, saw still another
attractive bride last week, when the Frank
Johnsons’ Beatrice took Dr. MacCreadie
Luker, of Roseville, for a penny or a pound.
The knot was tied by Canon Langley with
full choral honors, and the girl of the moment
was a picture in ivory georgettes weighted
with silver embroideries and side flounces
of ivory lace. Rich lace frothed on the geor-
gette train, which carried chenille embroid-
eries, and a beautiful lace veil cascaded over
the whole. Sister Edith, in blue and gold,
’maided. The wedding foods were spread
at Lumeah. the bride’s Point Piper home,
where mother hostessed in turquoise blue
frocking and plumed black millinery.
Jean Mowat Esplin, second daughter of
the George Esplins, of Merool, Hay, has
promised John Malcolm to buy a trousseau.
He is the eldest son of the Allan Mclnneses,
of Bottle Creek.
Two well-known squatting families were
linked up the other day when pretty Nedda
(Neradah) Macphillamy, of the Waroo
branch of the clan, married Charles Hedley
Edols, of Burrawang station, also in the
Forbes district. The local Presbyterian
Church was the matrimonial smithy, and
padre George Keith, of Sydney, did the rivet-
ing. The bride wore ivory velvets and
mother’s wedding veil of Brussels point.
Beatrice Swales and Phyllis Edols ’maided,
Neil Macphillamy best-manned, and Bret
AH port was cast as ’groomsman.
Mrs. Harold Clapp, the dark-haired, dark-
eyed wife of Melbourne’s Railways head, is
in Sydney with the book of an opera to which
conductor Frank St. Leger is fitting the
musical parts.
Days are lengthening, and two prospectors
are soon leaving Sydney for their mining
lease and shack on the heights of Kiandra.
They are the Australian-born adventurous
John Sutherland and his wife. Mr. Suther-
land had been in the Royal Air Force. His
wife saw four years’ service as a V.A.D. on
various fronts —France, Italy, Egypt and
Macedonia. In the last-named country of
mixed races and every imaginable degree of
dirt and fever, five decorations —one from
the King of Serbia —came her way. The
Sutherlands have leased a fiat like the top
deck of a ship on the heights above the north
side of the harbor. It’s an eyrie to return
to when the winter snow piles up on
Kiandra.
What grudge has August against the
Smiths? Pianist Laurence Godfrey’s .wife
has just smashed her arm, and Dr. Nigel s
better half has broken her ankle.
A Brisbane postscript: —
Brisbane had its centenary kick-off in Albert Square
at mid-day on the 6th, when Sir Matthew was on
the grandstand at 1 o’clock with Col. Durrant and
A.-D.-C. Turner, the Mayoral Barrys, the Theodores,
Archgaiters Sharp, oldest-native-born Brisbaneite Mrs.
Trundle, Marion Oxley (who travelled from the south
for the occasion) and aldermen and colonels galore.
In the evening barricades in brilliantly-illuminated
Queen-street kept back a pack of humanity, and
most would-be sightseers who left it till “after tea”
had to walk into the city to see the finest proces-
sion Brisbane has ever staged. At Bowen Park the
grandstands were illuminated and there was open-air
dancing. But the south side remained obstinately
dark, having made no special effort for the jamboree.
On the same afternoon there was a shivoo at the
Bellevue in aid of the Women’s College Fund. Roses
and sweet-peas scented the air, and cards and mah
jong absorbed the attention of the non-jazzers.
The Old Grammarians had their ball that night in
the South-side City Hall. Among the notable dressers
were Mrs. Bonsfield in black georgette, Clover
Thompson in peach pink, and Jean Oxley in pale
blue.
Sir Matthew went to the State Orchestral Concert
in the Exhibition Hall on the 7th with Mrs. Turner
and Dr. .Eneas McDonnell. George Sampson con- -
ducted, and Canon de Witt Batty and his fiancee,
the judicial Shands, the clerical Lefanus, and the
Macnaughtons were in the crowd.
Marion Oxley, descendant of the famous Lieut.
John, was tea-ed by Mrs. Morry Barry at Lennon’s.
The Mayoral Gilpins, of Sydney, were there; also Mrs.
Theodore and Mrs. T. J. Ryan. Another tea was
given by the E. Lanes to singer Carrie Lanceley.
At this also the Sydney Mayoral Gilpins were present.
The new ballroom at Lennon’s was officially opened
in the evening and had itself hung with chains of
sweet-peas for the event. Gwen Foote gave a
symbolic dance, and those who applauded included
the Theodores, Bulcocks, A. P. Greenfields and
Oxleys. The Children’s Hospital benefits by the
takings.
The Trades Hall, prettily done up for the night,
saw the presentation of a set of furs to Mrs. Huxham;
the Harbor Lights Guild had a shivoo the same
evening; his Ex. gave a tennis party at Government
House in the afternoon, and Cumbrae Stewart said
what he thought about women of the nineteenth
century at the Women’s Club.
The Countrywomen’s Assoc, held up the principal
streets on the Bth as badge, flower and sweet
brigands. Teddy Ahern helped things along with a
tea at the Gresham, at which Robert Chisholm sang
five times and Nell Douglas Graham recited Essex
Evans’s “Women of the West.” Mrs. Steele has
offered to put down a pound for every thousand
collected in Bananaland and guarantees three friends
to do likewise.
Died last week, at 69, in the Ipswich Hospital,
Temple Clerk, whose tall figure waving a Union
Jack was always a feature of patriotic displays.
He was also an ardent worker for child welfare and
a good friend to the Children’s Hospital. Associated
with the priekly-pear branch of the Lands Depart-
ment, he imported the cochineal insect and wrote a
good deal about the spiny pest. He was English
born, but his family used to be well known in the
Tenterfield (N.S.W.) district. His daughter was
the first Mrs. Noel Drury, she having been married
on her deathbed to the man to whom she had
been engaged for some time.
Lennon’s ballroom staged the Art Society’s Ball.
Sir Matthew was there with the Tullys, Nancy
McGowan, Elizabeth Dods and A.-D.-O. Turner and
private-sec. Saunders. His Ex. gave a dinner at
Government House earlier in the evening.

DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
Roisol fulfilled the prophecy that he would
repeat Les Paddington’s achievement last year, and
that of Colonel Shjlinski in 1902, of landing- the Aus-
tralian Hurdle and Steeple. Fleetstpne’s connec-
tions mistakenly thought that the National
winner had returned to his Flemington form, and
backed him down to 9 to 2, but Roisel was a firm
favorite at 5 to 2, and, jumping brilliantly for the
most part, he had the field settled a long way from
home. At the ehd he was five lengths in front of
the ancient Wooloo (s’s), with Palbi (7’s) six lengths
behind the old ’un and the rest stringing out at
painful intervals. It was a day of accidents. In
the Ackaringa Hurdle, which was won easily by the
10-to-i chance Kileevy, the favorites Mnemar and Sir
Blankney fell and were killed. St. Roseland also
fame down, Lachlan broke down, and Redoubtable
lost his rider. In the Australian Steeple, Quarry-
man broke his leg and Pittsworth fell over him, whilst
Aberbar, Somewortli and Front Rank also toppled over.
The list of casualties was completed in Uncas’s Know-
sley Steeple (another 10-to-l shot, he beat a hot
pot in Chrysostom) by mishaps to King Neptune,
R.itang, Liverpool, Away Away, Earl Benz and Sir
Laddon. It is a startling total for one day, especially
as Caulfield is a comparatively easy course, and the
question arises whether present-day hurdlers and
jumpers are sufficiently schooled.
Considering the bad run he got, the Comedy King
colt, Royal Charter, who was backed like a certainty,
lost no friends as a result of his failure in the
Chatsworth Plate. Once he emerged from the ruck he
galloped like a racehorse, and was just cut out of
a place. Vinstra, a half-brother (by Lucknow) to
El Dorado, surprised by breaking even with the second
favorite, Three Kings. There wasn’t a shilling for
Vinstra, who was beaten in the run-off; his condition
was such that one race was quite enough for him on
the day. It was an unlucky afternoon for the
family, inasmuch as El Dorado, finishing fast as usual,
was just pipped in the Balaclava Stakes by the
much-traveiled Imputation, who is beginning to shape
like a stayer, as a daughter of Lady Wallace should.
The Godby—Corteen—Tye amalgamation played up its
Three Kings winnings on Coolah in the Stakes and on
Irish Rhythm in the St. Aubin Welter. The Irish
gent, ran very well, but the weight (lOst.) told on
him in the last 100 yards and Sidonia (Linacre —
Nyora) beat him home.
* * * *
Vsilamita began the season auspiciously
for the progeny of Valais by running away with a
mile Welter at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.). Although
the colt’s two-year-old form had been good, and the
handicapper hadn’t been hard on him, backers mostly
preferred the very moderate Flippinere, who had run
unplaced earlier in the day, but Valamita had the
race wen at any stage of the journey. Stoutly bred
on both sides of the house, he may have an outside
chance in the A.J.C. Derby. Jim Murillo and
Ulandra, hardy old battlers both, were the only
favorites to bob up, the other seven races being
profitable to the pencillers. The Maoriland crowd
put in on Murihaupo in the Flying Handicap, bur.
McCarten rode a rather slovenly finish and was beaten
by little Donnelly on the Aerofox —Close Call mare
Foxy, who has done well for her stable since she
came from the ponies. Perhaps McCarten was dis-
tressed by the knowledge that his handling of Royal
Despatch in the Maiden Handicap had been questioned
by the stewards, and that he wouldn’t know his
fate till Mondav. On that dav the officials, com-
pleting their investigations, disqualified the crack
M.L. horseman and F. D. Jones, the trainer, for
12 months, and invited the owner, H. A. Knight, to
show cause whv bis animal shouldn’t be included in
the sentence —he himself is in Maoriland. Jones is
the man who brought Ballymena to Sydney last year,
and other members of his team, besides Royal Despatch
and the A.J.C. Derby winner, are Murihaupo, Alfonso,
Currency. the Derby eolts Killochra and Cawnpore,
and the flying Glentruin. In short, he is a man ot
considerable tonnage in the racing world, but. tun
stewards showed in the Bryans ease that they aie
not to be deterred by any such consideration from
doing their duty, according to their lights.
“Obs”: On the subject of foster-mothers
(B. 31/7/’24), Valvoid, by imported Valido —Void,
was reared on cows’ milk sweetened with sugar,
Ids mother having died when he was five weeks old.
Though not exactly a high-class performer, Valvoid
has won a dozen or more races in fiitoria, and has
certainly been more successful than his older half-
brother, Tony John, by John O’Lorne (imp.). Thar;
son of Void, nourished by his mother (and a very
good mother she was), grew into a big well-developed
sort, but wasn’t of much account on the turf. The
cow s’ milk evidently did not effect Valvoid’s speed;
moreover, at four months old he looked better than
most of the foals in the neighborhood. He was bred
bv P. J. Coffev, at Lake Albert, near Wagga (N.S.W.).

“Flicker" : The passengers on an incoming
mailboat had got up a sweep on the Grand National,
and all were anxious to hear the result. “Sparks”
had promised to let them know as soon as possible,
and on Sunday morning was trying to get into
touch with someone who had the dinkum oil. Mean-
while the sporting Anglican parson, who had drawn
Haoma, was conducting a morning service. “Breth-
ren,” he remarked at the close, a little absent-
mindedly, “we shall now rise and sing the Grand
National Anthem.” And the petition to Providence
on behalf of George V. didn’t sound any the worse
for it.

“I)nx”: The MX. jockeys’ premiership
for 1923-24 ended in a dead-heat, M. McCarten (at
present in Sydney) and C. Emerson registering
47 firsts. But the best record was really that of
Hector Gray, who only returned from England
towards the end of January, yet ran into fourth
place with 40 wins. His last success was on a
hurdler at Gisborne.

As in the match against the Chinese,
Patterson and O’Hara Wood defeated the Mexicans
Llano, Borbolla and Gerdes without losing a set.
Their next contest will be against the Japanese at
Providence, Rhode Island, Shimidzu and Okamoto
having Ousted the Canadians Crocker and Wright.
Shimidzu is reported to be below his best form;
and in the doubles against the Canadians, who are
not ranked as first-class, he and his partner were
defeated in straight sets. This doesn’t suggest that
they are capable of lowering the colors of the
Australian pair, who are playing as well as they
ever did in their lives.

Tom Gibbons got nothing but a pummel-
ling out of his fight with Dempsey, but on the strength
of his good showing he has made a lot of easy
money since, in London hot week he got the thick-
end of a £16,000 purse for landing a few punches on
Jack Bloomfield. Bloomfield had been industriously
boomed as “the man of whom Carpentier is afraid,”
and “the best English heavyweight since Charlie
Mitchell,” but he never had a hope against the
American, who knocked him silly in the second round
and sent over the finishing punch in the third. When
several years younger (he is 35 now) Gibbons was
unable to beat men whom the late Les Darcy skittled
in a few rounds. Had Darcy survived that ill-starred
American tour he would probably* have grown into a
12st. 71b. man, in which case he would have been a
match for either Gibbons (12st. 41b.) or Dempsey
(13st. 81b.), who is reported to be willing to cross
the Pond and smite Thomas again if the English pro-
moters will cough up £lOO,OOO, or something like
that.

In the matter of streaming gore and flying
skin and liair, the Locke-Evans fight, at Sydney
Stadium, would have satisfied a Roman tart of Nero’s
time. Evans was tough, but Locke was tougher, and
the Queensland welter was a decisive winner at the final
bell. He lias a future in pugilism if he can master
the feeling which ihipels him to throw defence to the
winds and annihilate his man with one punch.
JACK GREEN, “Tasman;’ of the Age,
who has been appointed V.R.C. stipen-
diary steward in place of the late Cap-
tain Hobson.
There was nothing Shakspearean about
the tragedy which took place at the Melbourne
Stadium last Saturday, but it is the sort of tragedy
that history is constantly writing. Clarence Weber
(13st. 61b.) looked as if he should be able to eat
Walter Miller (list. 61b.), but he is several years
older, and years cancelled his advantage in weight,
while the advantage in cleverness was on the Ameri-
can’s side. After three indecisive bouts of ten minutes
each, in which the wrestlers several times fell
amongst the ropes and once went right over them,
Miller secured a hammerlock which obliged the
big man to tap the mat. Weber's offensive powers
had now petered out, and the middleweight soon had
him on his back again, with a half-nelson this time.
As the loser drooped in his corner, Miller moved a
step towards him and paused uncertainly, for there
had been bad blood between the pair. Then he
advanced again and offered the extended palms of
friendship.
MILLS, of the B.A. XVIII. Six-feet-seven
of muscle and hustle.
“Feng-Shui”: Those who find rodeos re-
volting, and modern glove-fighting brutal, should stay
away from a Javanese gctekan, if one comes their
way. The Javanese is the mildest-mannered man that
ever cut and ran, but at these shows the spectators
go mad with frenzy, and the Regent’s police are kept
busy racing round and round the sweating circle of
lookers-on, cooling their ardor with leather sjamboks.
The challengers come out in the middle of the ring
and, facing -the members of the opposing faction,
shout obscene insults and provoke them with gestures
whose lewd import is known throughout the East.
Each combatant strips himself to his sarong, binds
a scarf below his breast, leaving his chest and
shoulders bare, and arms himself with a rotan, a
stout switch of cane about seven feet in length and
split to give a good cutting edge. The preliminary
action is an important part of the game. The two
combatants crouch in the grass and creep towards
each other like snakes. Then they circle round and
retire to return again, what time the crowd frantically
applauds. At last they rise and face each other,
holding their weapons in both hands; one arm
carried well back, the other pushed far forward, so
that the canes bend behind their heads like stretched
bows. One strikes, the other dips like lightning, and
the stroke whistles harmlessly above his head, while
Ins swift counterstroke meets nose, mouth and shoulder
ot his antagonist with a smack like a stockwhip.
The man struck puts his hands on his hips, throws
back his head and bursts into a roar of laughter,
while the blood leaps from his cheeks and great red
weals come out on his body; the other meanwhile
is dancing and crowing along the ranks of his enemv’s
supporters. Bout follows bout, each man aiming one
tremendous blow and then waiting for the answering
stroke of his opponent, until the laughter of the
losing man grows slack, he flinches from the return
blow, and runs. As one champion vanquishes opponent
after opponent the men of his village become frantic
with delight, flinging themselves in unison in the
air and at every leap bringing forth the “sorak,” the
Malay warcry, while the Regent’s police run up and
down, flaying the line of dancing legs. The com-
- ladylike games of Rugby and Soccer are
being introduced nowadays by the authorities because

“Herodot” : 'Thirty years ago the favorite
haunt of the Sydney cockfighting fraternity was on
the wooded heights of the North Shore. There it
was no uncommon thing for anything from a dozen
to a score of separate fights to be carried out on a
Sunday morning, the interested parties coming from
as tar afield as Parramatta and the nearer mining;
townships of the South Coast. Bookmakers also
attended, and sometimes large sums would change
hands as the result of a bout between two champions.
Naturally .the ‘sport” attracted some rough cus-
tomers, fist fights were frequent, and “scalers” were
not uncommon. As the population of the locality-
increased followers of the game were driven back
into the further scrub towards Middle Harbor and
Balmoral, on the Mosman side, and when the public
conscience revolted against the barbarity of the busi-
ness (or its tediousness as a gamble compared with
two-up) they were dispersed altogether.

“Centurion”; My abject apologies to
“Nitric” (B. 31/7/’24) for having slain the old
Warwick (Q.) Zingari C. C., the more so because
my dad was one of the original members. I have
before me a photo of a Zingari team of 1870, which
visited Brisbane that year. One of the XI is
missing from the photograph, but the others, beside
my progenitor, were W. B. Slade, of Glengallan,
mentioned by “Nitric”; E. H. King, later g.-m. of
the N.B.A. Co. ; S. P. Fraser, master at Toowoomba
Grammar School and an old Etonian; H. Veitch,
who went to England again to become an M.F.H.;
R. Watts, of Eton Yale; Campbell Turner; Sydnev
Roberts, of Toowoomba ; S. B. Kennard, of Tandilla';
and J. D. Steele, till recently in the Queensland
Lands Department. Slade and Kennard were old
Sherborne boys, and Veitch had been to Winchester, f
am not sure about the cricket nursery of the others,
save the dad’s, which was the Navy. The tribal
archives also contain the Zingari badge affected by
the team —a large oval of white flannel, with the
monogram in colors, to be sewn presumably on the
shirt. It does not appear in my photograph, though
the weird flat bats mentioned by “Nitric” are
well in evidence.
* * * *
“0.R.” : An unprecedented feature of the
English team picked for Australia is that three-
quarters of them are from the “home” counties, those
handiest to London. Sussex and Kent get three
representatives apiece; Gibson must be included in
the former, although he has played little in England
the last two or three seasons. Middlesex and S'uriev
have two apiece, and Essex contributes Douglas ti>’
evergreen. Chapman plays for Berkshire, which is
only of second-class rank. The remainder of England
albeit it includes 12 out of the 17 first-class counties
supplies only four players. The .North has but three
tepi esentatives, two from Yorkshire and one from
Lancashii e, though the latter ma.y get a second in
Duckworth. The W est has one, a Somerset man. The
Midlands have none at all; there can have been few
if any, visiting teams in the past without a Notts
man.
* * * *
The N. S. Wales baseballers proved greatly
superioi to the \ ictori&n B.nd h.A. tennis in the inter
State series at Sydney. They won all their matches
scoring 45 runs to 6 ; S. Aus. took one match and
lost two, and Vic. were downed in three. Ma State
was best served by the pitchers, Hogg and Ford: the
lattei s outing* of 15 S.A. batsmen, with no “wa Iks *
was remarkable. In C. Ewers S. Aus. has a south-
paw of promise.
* * * *
Although Perth critics gave them little
chance of retaining their pre-eminence (one writer
gloomily observed that several members of the team
were fitter for a hospital ward than a football field)
the Westralians commenced at Hobart by handsomelv
defeating South Australia. The Croweaters put in
some very attractive play, but the Gropers carried
more weight and operated a more closely-knit system.
N. S. Wales beat Queensland, but neither team gave
the 14,0C0 spectators anything to write home about
Tasmania met Victoria with much determination but
little hope. They were out-generalled bv the Patsv
O’Brien combination in high-marking and boot-power
but their nippy ground play prevented a two-to-one
defeat -13 to 7 in goals, each side having nearlv a
score of behinds. Bv this time public enthusiasm
had reached such a pitch that plans were laid to camp
on the North Hobart Oval on Friday night, so as to
secure seats for Saturday’s meeting of the Westralian
and Victorian eighteens. The Victorians were both
heavier and taller than the Westerners, but not
Quite so fast. It was probably the greatest match in
the history of the Australian game. At quarter-time
Victoria had 4 goals 8 behinds to Westralia’s 4 goals
6 behinds; at half-time it was 9—lo to 9 —B *at
three-quarter time each side had 13 goals 10 behinds.
With a behind and a goal (his seventh) Campbell
put the Jarrahl anders seven points ahead, but Vic-
toria rallied grandly, broke through the stubborn
W.A. back line twice, and held their lead till the
bell brought relief to muddy and (in many cases)
blood-bedabbled leather-chasers—Victoria 15—13 (10'{
points; W.A. 14—11 (95 points). It was a mag-
nificent exhibition of the national code.
The Hobart tournament is the fifth of its kind.
Each State except Queensland has had the fixture,
and the advantage of playing at home has been
strongly marked. In 1908—the only occasion on
whieli M.L. sent a team —Victoria won very easilv
in Melbourne. In 1911 S.A. had a fairly comfortable
task at Adelaide. Sydney held the show in 1914,
war breaking out just in time to spoil it; Victoria
the winners. There was no further gathering till
1921, when Westralia, playing at Perth, just scraped
home from Victoria and S.A, in turn, and took
the premiership. One man—“ Nipper” Truscott, the
Westralian —has played in all the “carnivals.”
Victoria’s second XVIII took a fall out of S.
Aussie’s second team before about 25,000 Melbourne
spectators. After a clean, pleasant game, Victoria
boasted 123 points to S. Australia’s 93. O’Grady,
the smart S.A. rover, tickled the crowd hugely owing
to his wearing glasses throughout the disturbance.
* * * *
“Wink” : Members of the Johnson clan may
predominate in Melbourne football as far as numbers
are concerned (B. 7/8/’24), but none of those now
playing show the talent for the game that other
representatives of the tribe had in the past. About
10 years ago Wally Johnson, who bogged in foi
Fitzroy, was the best half-back in the business:
and a decade before that dusky Joe Johnson, with the
same team, was a wonder. When too old to chase
the bag of wind, Joe took on the less arduous game
of two-un, and has remained faithful to it ever
since. The noblest Johnson of them all, however,
played for Carlton in their invincible days—from
1905 onwards. During that period there was no
brighter star in the football firmanent than “Mallee”
Johnson.
* * * #
“Samuel”: The team of abos. from
Brungle, mentioned by “Ibis” (B. 31/7/’24), is not
the only all-black combination that N. S. Wales can
boast. I was one of a side that journeyed from
Stroud in 1919 to play against the at Itaruah
Point (North Coast). Not one of the bucks wore
boots, and all had a cheerful contempt for the rule
that an opponent may only be tackled when in
possession of the ball. But their back division
could run and dodge like hares, and showed clever
team-work in passing rushes. They beat us 6to
nil, much to the delight of their gins, who had
continually exhorted their lords to “Kill ’em, kill
’em till deir bones crack.”
* * * *
After having lost two matches against
Maoriland, the English Rugby Leaguers won the
third at Wellington by 31 to 18. Their big forwards
had things all their own way in the opening half,
in which they scored 20 to 3, but the Maorilanders
had the better of the game after the spell. Immensely
pleased at succeeding where Australia failed, the
M.L. League now talks of sending a side across the
ocean to beat the Britons on their own soil.
* * * *
The Sydney match between Fnlkiner and
Walter Lindrum is producing some beautiful billiards.
On Monday Falkiner contributed a great 985, dis-
tinguished by perfect top-of-the-table play. It is
the Englishman’s best break to date, and the
highest ever made by a visitor to Australia.
* * * *
“Ngatik” : “Raditauna” ( R. *>l/7'241
slips a bit when he declares that the Port Moresby
canoes are the fastest afloat. When he has pros-
pected the Pacific and seen the Gilbert Islanders
at work in their canoes he will alter bis opinion.
There is one sail only, and the expert Gilberter
uses neither rudder nor paddle, the steering being
accomplished entirely by manipulating the sail. This
is made possible by the cunning design of the craft,
which is made of smooth pieces of light, planking,
laced together with prepared cocoanut fibre. Fifteen
knots is not uncommon with the racing canoes, which
are not dugouts. The Mokil Island craft —small
one-man affairs—are equally fast, but are rarely
taken outside the lagoon.
THE PENALTIES OF GREATNESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Mr. Bruntnell said that before he became Minister
for Education he went to football and cricket matches,
but now the opening of new schools had become his
permanent Saturday-afternoon recreation.”
They have their guerdons, and their burdens, too,
These jobs that shining eminence proclaim;
He may not do as lie was wont to do
Before he rose to fame.
No more o’ Saturdays his way he’ll wend
To where the “muddied oafs” or “flannelled fools”
In brisk and generous rivalry contend—
He has to open schools.
No more for him the wild exultant thrill
When strenuous batsmen panting bowlers clout,
And scornful critics bellow from the Hill
“You’ll never get ’em out!”
He may not hear the fierce, discordant hoots
That show the referee’s decisions jar,
Or join the cheering when some champion boots
The ball above the bar.
Where many a tight-packed stand with clamor rings
He may not add his quota to the row;
Tlie rigid obligations office brings,
These are his portion now.
He may not be where sporting impulse stirs
The Mood, and frenzied barrack splits the sky
As gladiators grapple. Ministers
Have other fish to fry.
His lines are cast where from dull tongues are rolled
Set platitudes in phrase precise and prim.
Those glad, tumultuous Saturdays of old
Approach no more for him.

NewESSE
A SIX Built 6y Hudson
Has Qualities of Both Hudson
and the Former Essex
Essex alone shares the noted Hudson pat-
ents. That means —in this moderate-priced
“Six”—you get the very features that made
Hudson famous for long life, reliability and
fine performance.
And with those added advantages, the price
is lower than Essex quality ever sold for.
The qualities of economy, inexpensive main-
tenance and endurance which won such
wide preference for the former Essex in this
territory as in other parts of the world, are
continued and improved in the New Essex.
Economy in fuel, oil and tires is greater.
More accessible for replacements or repairs
which means less maintenance expense.
Lower center of gravity and unique spring
arrangement gives safety and comfort
on all roads at all speeds. Steering is as easy
as guiding a bicycle. Little attention is re-
quired to lubricate and keep the car in tip
top condition.
To all you know of the former Essex is added
the confidence that it is built by the Hudson
Motor Car Company, the sixth largest pro-
ducer of automobiles in the world. You are
invited to inspect the new Essex and take
a ride.
In either the Coach, with closed car conforts
or the open touring model, we believe you
will agree the new Essex provides ideal trans-
portation. The price takes it out of all com-
petition with cars of comparable quality.

THE INKY WAY.
In Sydney they now call it Writs
Weekly.
“Mel”: A cousin and namesake of Charles Lever,
the novelist, is manager of a popular pub. in Boueke-
street, Melbourne. He can tell tales, too, worthy of
the author of “Harry Lorrequer,” of his adventures
as a “brassbounder” on China clippers, and as a sun
downer in the Backblocks.
“Bandicoot”: Charley Baumgartner and Neville
Sni th, formerly of Melbourne Herald, are two of the
younger generation who are trying their luck in
the Street of Adventure which starts at Temple B,u
and runs into Ludgate Circus. Young Smith is a
son of A. N. Smith, the well-known news-distributor.
“Inquay”: Dick Reading, formerly editor of London
Sporting Chronicle, has given up oyster-breeding
at Brunswick Heads (N.S.W.) to join the staff
of Melbourne Herald. He served with the Belgian
Army during part of the Great War, and swings a
badly-battered leg as a memento of the torpedoing
of the Mongolia.
“Union Poet”: Several Melbourne weeklies pay the
same flat rate (2d. a line) for verse as for prose.
When a poet complained of this as unfair, the manager
of a big paper blandly pointed out that although,
gome of the lines were quite short—merely half a!
line, in fact—the accountant' made no deduction on
that account. The poet left hastily to escape being
asked for a refund.
“M.D.”; J. B. Priestley, in London Mercury, refers
to “Asterisk’s” letters from the South Seas published
last year under the title “Isles of Illusion.” He is a
bit cold on “Asterisk’s” novel, “Gone Native,” pro-
nouncing it a not very skilful narrative, which betrays
the prentice hand in more than one place. “Asterisk”
is in real life Mr. Fletcher, of Makatea, a French
phosphate island 100 miles south of Papeete.
“Cartot”: Australian journalism lost one of its
oldest and most picturesque figures by the death at
Cremorne (Sydney) of George Johnson. Bora in Eng-
land 81 years ago, he came to Australia in his
early twenties and made straight for the goldfields;
at Lambing Flat and elsewhere he participated in
some colorful chapters of Australian history. As a
journalist he had a vigorous style, and was one of the
first in Australia to specialise in mining and financial
articles.
“S.T.S.”: Professor Darnley Naylor, of Adelaide
Uni., is chuckling over an American review of his
much-praised work on the precise arrangement of
words in Latin. He used, incidentally, the famous
expression of Mrs. Malaprop, “a nice derangement of
epitaphs.” But the Malaprop humor does not seem
to have reached academic circles in the U.S.A. ; at
any rate, the Chicago University Journal of Philology,
while praising the work, gravely called attention to
this “obvious misprint.”
Hansard reporting agrees with some men, but few
do a 40 years’ continuous stretch. Two members of
the Maoriland service-—J. W. Geddis and Silas Spragg
' have just completed that term, and have retired on
superannuation. Both men at the • time they joined
M.L. Hansard were chief reporters, Geddis on Auck-
land Star and Spragg on Otago Daily Times. D.
11. Cameron moves up to the position of chief of
Hansard. He has been about a quarter of a century
using up good notebooks in the Gallery.
“Max M.” : Arthur Lovekin, M.L.C., owner of Perth
Daily News, has just handed out a bonus of £3O to
every member of his staff who has put in three
years’ service, and lesser amounts in other eases, in
celebration of a successful year. “Lovey” made a
pot of money during the newsprint famine in war-
time through his faculty of foreseeing what was going
to happen. He resists most Arbitration Court proceed-
ings for raising salaries and wages obstinately and
desperately ; but he has a kindly streak in him, and
has given away substantial sums to charity—without
making a song about it, either.
“Millbrook”: “Cosmo” suggests a journalistic
offensive against the “redundant preposition” in
phrases like “wait on” and “listen in.” But it
isn t necessarily meaningless. “Wait on,” I submit,
may. be used with perfect correctness for “Go on
waiting”—compare Keats’s “Ye soft pipes, play on.”
Also the preposition isn’t redundant when it narrows
°n s P e ? ialis jes what the verb usually conveys. After
all, “listening in” is not the same as listening, any
more than “looking out” is the same as looking
or ‘washing up” the same as washing.
“Crosshead”: Fred Whitehead, of the Herald, is
the new president of the Vic. district of the A.J.A.
Dave Clarke (the Herald’s Federal roundsman) and
Syd Deamer (city editor of the Evening Sun) arc
vice-presidents ; the new secretary is Glaude Thomp-
son, of Truth. The incoming committee has lots
of work before it. New offices have to be found;
the club question has to be tackled ; and a way of
getting the lukewarm majority to take an interest
in the Association has to be discovered. At the
general meeting affiliation with the Trades Hall was
suggested, but the meeting laughed it out.
“Grammaticus” : While I share “Cosmo’s” aversion
to the redundant preposition (B. 31/7/’24), the use of
this suffix is, nevertheless, a characteristic of the
language. In colloquial speech it can tremendously
widen the scope of the verb, so that the latter repre-
sents several quite distinct ideas. Compare “pick” with
“pick up,” “pick over” and “pick on” (some-
body), or “knock” with “knock in,” “knock under,"
“knock oyer,” “knock up,” “knock down.” It ' s
worth noting that most of the verbs that require this
suffix are pure Anglo-Saxon ; usually the single word
of Latin origin tells the whole story, whereas the
strung (?) Saxon word must have another to lean on.
“T.P.”: The Sydney correspondent of the Argus
concluded a paragraph recording that the N.S.W.
State-school children had raised over a thousand
pounds for the Henry Lawson Memorial with the un-
gracious comment that “there are those who still
contend that they ought not to have had their school
time intruded upon for the purpose, and that any
appeal to them ought to have been made in their
homes.” And the preceding item is a whoop over
the presentation to Charles Hackett, a visiting Ameri-
can concert-singer, of “a gold cigar box set with
gems. A large opal flamed in the centre, and at
each corner rubies and emeralds mingled their rays”!
“Lei”: A Maorilander of some note on the Aus-
tralian Inky Way of 30 years ago was Arthur Des-
mond, the red-headed poet who wrote “Our Kin?
That Is to Come” and other verses above mediocrity-
He also was the author of a somewhat downright
book called “Might Is Right,” a new edition w
which recently appeared in the U.S.A. But he is
best remembered as the publisher and editor of an
impossible “financial” sheet named Hard Gash, which
used to appear spasmodically' during the days oi
1892-93 when banks were crashing, and Desmond
was doing his best to help them. The police badly
wanted to know where Hard Cash was printed; but
as fast as things got too warm in one cellar or
garret the barrowload of type and hand-press were
shifted to another. It was for selling Hard Cash
that certain newsagents w T ere prosecuted and some
of them gaoled—ameng them the late W. H.
McNamara and the still living Samuel Albert Rosa*
“Bloggs”: To the regret of many of us, Sydney
Telegraph has joined the ranks of those that stand
off and view themselves with wonder and admiration
A notorious limelighter—usually a politician or doctm
-—is buttonholed by a reporter and asked what W
thinks of the paper’s Purer Morals Campaign, or it®
great £lOOO competition designed to discover the
best method of eliminating “guns” from pony-racing-
The politician applauds the journal as a great in-
formative organ, and the paper prints the tribute
and adds a few commendatory remarks on its own
account, and writes a leader about itself pointing out
its value to the community, and inserts a letter c
two of praise signed “Fervent Admirer,” by whicn
time the hour is about ripe for the editor to arrang
an interview' with another limelighter, and pour -
fresh consignment of butter over the office, lh.i
sort of thing may “go down” in the polyglot county
of its origin. But in Australia one can prett-
well measure the popularity and influence of a news-
paper by its abstinence from self-praise and cheap
braggadocio. The skiting sheets are all failures mm
or less; and this I take to be a tribute to tni
critical faculty of Australians and to our inucn-
mabgned education system.

With the shadow of the guillotine resting
on him from the rise of the curtain, Andre
Chenier captured the sympathy and the
imagination of a crowded Sydney Majesty’s
on Saturday night. Giordano’s opera, never
produced before in Australia, though nearly
JO years old, lias the French Revolution
woven into its music and its drama like a
crimson thread. The central figure is the
ill-starred poet Chenier, who espoused the
people’s cause, only to become a victim of
the Reign of Terror. Chenier loves and is
beloved by Madeleine, daughter of the noble
house of Coigny, but she is also loved by
Gerard. He in pre-revolutionary days has
lost his job as footman in her mother’s castle
because he dares to dream, even like Chenier,
of liberty and equality. How through
jealousy he later betrays the poet, and then,
repenting, tries in vain to undo the harm,
was told melodically and enthrallingly to
Saturday-night listeners.
* * # •
In this work there is quickness of action,
a dramatic culmination of effects, and an
analytical sense of psychology. The char-
acter study of Gerard, first footman, then
revolutionary leader—-an extraordinary mix-
ture of ambition, romance, cruelty and
nobility—was expressed in all its varying
moods by the fluent and colorful music.
Granforte in the part conveyed every nuance
of the high lights and half-tones of Gerard’s
“LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR,” AT
SYDNEY MAJESTY’S.
Lord Ashton (Grandini), Bidebent (Umberto
di Lelio) and Ravenswood (Cappelli)
discuss Lucia in the grand-opera manner.
complicated character. Neither he nor Pic-
caluga ever sang more thrillingly. Every
act provides large chances for the tenor, and
Piccaluga conveyed the sensibility of the
Poet’s nature with real artistry and con-
sistent tunefulness. Lina Scavizzi, as the
bowed but courageous Madeleine, whose in-
trusion into the gory episodes is preceded,
I’inero fashion, by a letter, rose to heights
of sheer magnificence in her big act with
Granforte before the Tribunal scene. Again,
when choosing the guillotine with her lover
rather than life without him, her final out-
pourings of emotion were heart-breaking.
Doris Mclnnes was dead after the first act;
but while she lived she added dignity and
sweet song to an opening ballroom scene.
Two other star features of this act (in
addition, of course, to the poet’s famous im-
provisation) were the Pastoral chorus and
the Gavotte danced by a group of Watteau
shepherds and shepherdesses. Azzolini pro-
vides the only gleam of fun in four episodes
of gloom. Versatile Luigi Cilia was first an
Abbe and afterwards a swaggering “In-
credible.” A double part was also played
by Carmen Tornari. She was first Made-
leine’s companion and later (quite splen-
didly, too) a bent old lady. Paolantouio
conducted as Paolantonio does.
“Little Nellie Kelly,” now at Sydney
Opera House, is a very diverting show of
its kind —the kind in which the feminine
passion for finery and the masculine interest
in mannequins are cunningly exploited by
playwrights and lyrists of the department-
store school. In the fashioning of the plea-
sant trifle the old has been artfully blended
with the new. Ancient wheezes like “When
Greek meets Greek they open an oyster-
shop” mingle with the latest about bootleg-
gers and wood-alcoliol; a mid-Victorian
motliali-song is followed by an up-to-the-
minute tango; even the comic Irish police-
man is revived and brought up to date. And,
by way of flattering the democratic suscep-
tibilities of the Race, which might other-
wise resent the resuscitation, the good shop-
girl of Hibernian extraction rejects the idle
Fifth Avenue millionaire for Jerry Conroy
and his job in the machine-shop, or what-
ever it is. Mamie Watson, as Little Nellie
(Mamie is surely sft. Sin.), sings and dances
as charmingly as in “The O’Brien Girl,”
and keeps the women wondering how she
manages to look so encliantingly slim with-
out ever once suggesting the odious word
“skinny.” Mark Daly makes the comic
policeman genuinely funny, and May Beatty
plays up to him admirably as a;
heavyweight widow. Perhaps there is
a thought too much garter in May’s
conception of the part and an excessive
display of bloomer in Maudie Vera’s lively
presentment of an intriguing housekeeper,
but the audience doesn’t seem to mind. June
Roberts rolls her eyes fascinatingly and is
equally eloquent with her dancing feet; Ley-
land Hodgson uplifts his agreeable baritone;
Ireland Cutter scores often and misses some-
times in a silly-beggah part; and versatile
Lou Vernon contrives to avoid caricaturing
a French draper. Other clever people who
reappear are Eric Masters, Mel. Ward, Ena
Dale, George Brown and Dorothy Roberts.
And there is nothing better in the show
than the Romany Tango danced by the exqui-
sitely moulded Hazel Harris and Wesley
Pierce, as tine a figure of a gipsy as ever
was.
At Sydney Palace one may make the
trip from Darjeeling to the top of Everest
w r ith the assistance of pictures, still and
moving, and the explanatory patter of Colonel
Pottinger, who was a member of the initial
expedition which went to select the best
angle from which the mountain could be
attacked. One may also gaze—mercifully,
at a safe distance —on the gentle and vermin-
ridden Thibetan, who shares with the Eskimo
the melancholy distinction of being the least
washed person on earth, and view mon-
asteries clinging to dizzy crags and mon-
strous idols and temples that look like drunken
bakehouses, and lamas who entertain shud-
dering explorers with a drink compounded
of stewed tea and rancid butter. The pic-
tures were well selected, except that there is
rather too much dancing by priests and other
grotesque persons; the Thibetan idea of
dancing looks about as imbecile to an Aus-
tralian as grand opera might appear to a
Thibetan. The views of Everest itself are
vivid and skilfully presented, with the posi
tion of the different camps by which it was
sought to scale the roof of the world clearly
indicated. The fullest credit is done to the
daring and determination of the climbers
who have taken part in the two assaults on
Everest, especially Messrs. Mallory and
Irving, who lost their lives a few months
ago; whether they ever reached the summit
can never be known until somebody gets
there and returns —and perhaps it won’t be
known then. Colonel Pottinger is quietly
confident that Everest will yet be conquered;
the first essentials of victory be regards as a
higher base-camp and a dash made a trifle
earlier in the year.
At Sydney Cri. “Kempy” is in its fourth
week of homely hilarity and O’Hara-ty.
“Good Morning, Dearie!” with its stacks
of scrumptious girls and stores of blithe-
some melodies continues to hit the spot at
Sydney Royal.

The Hanlon brothers are again showing
their disregard for N. S. Wales liquor la\vs
at Sydney Tivoli, and their pub, which is
conducted on free and easy lines, should prove
a popular place in the dry hours that follow
6 o’clock. The turn is well done, particu-
larly the illusions and simultaneous dancing,
and gives the bill a big lift. Marie Kendall’s
songs are still very popular, and an eager
crowd waits for the sparsely-concealed
“kicks” in the last lines. A Hawaiian duo
score well with quaint musicalities; and
Jules and Landry please with their graceful
steps.
For three days last -week camera men filled
the King’s Hall, Sydney, and imbibed enter-
tainment and instruction at a course of the
new Eastman school of professional pho-
tography as submitted in moving pictures,
lectures and demonstrations. The pictures
were in a tremendous film of 12 reels, brought
to Australia at the instance of J. Rouse,
managing-director of Kodak Ltd., and exhibit-
ing in actual operation every branch of a
completely equipped studio. The show in-
cluded samples of the work of the best men
in the business on each side of the Atlantic,
and there were incidental talks and demon-
strations by Monte Luke, Van der Velden,
E. A. Brown and E. Monteith (Melbourne),
each dealing with a particular aspect of the
business connected with the machine which
some rash person once said “cannot lie.”
One of Sydney's annuals: —
There are no outstanding canvases in the 45tn
exhibition of the Royal Art Society, but there are
fewer paintings of the student standard than in recent
years. The most refreshing note is struck in the
black-and-white section—-with a group of pictures
sent from America by the young Australian John R.
Flanagan, who had the unprecedented experience of
making his debut in The Bulletin with a front-page
MELBOURNE THEATRE ROYAL—
J. C. WILLIAMSON VAUDEVILLE
Marie Burke and Arthur Klein, who sing the
latter’s compositions; Irene Franklin,
the bright particular star of the bill.
cartoon half a dozen years ago. He combines sound
draughtsmanship with a fine sense of composition,
and has the priceless gift of imagination. The Gal-
lery trustees made no mistake in promptly buying
a couple of his pictures.
The show is weak in portraiture. Joseph Wolinsky,
J. S. Watkins and Dattilo Rubbo are at the head of
this section, but none has lifted his work beyond the
commonplace. The cnly uncompromising nude on the
walls is G. Lyall Trindall’s finely-attempted “Pink
Slippers,” in which he is fairly successful with his
flesh effects in a well-considered color-scheme; but
although there is some good modelling he goes astray
in the drawing of the legs. Lawson Balfour has a
commendable “La Vie,” a nude infant and a half-
clad woman in a sun-bathed glade—a lively bit of
painting as to both method and color. He and John
Banks, who has a couple of pieces near by, are travel-
ling on distinctive lines, and, though they have yet
a good way to go, they have with a refreshing rude-
ness definitely turned their backs upon Stodge.
J. W. Burgess, R. 1., R. 0.1., has a craftsmanlike can-
vas in “Trawlers,” a group of vessels looming against
an effulgent, stormy sky—a picture with much subtle
color underlying its slightly theatrical suggestion.
Veteran president Lister Lister is represented by
several paintings in his newer manner, and is more
successful in his smaller “Sunlight and Shadow” and
a glimpse of National Park than in his usual big
picture, whose interest hardly marches with its area.
James R. Jackson’s restless energy expresses itself
rather monotonously in his harbor-side landscapes
these days, but he has put some fine fresh work into
his figure subject “Dawn.” Gerald Fitzgerald’s big
“Silvery Mist” is a successful essay in a short-
range color scheme, with its trees faintly silhouetted
against a hazy sky, and makes his mountain pieces
suffer by comparison.
Charles Bryant, R. 0.1., contributes a couple
of New Guinea subjects stark in their tropical
coloring and formal in treatment. In handling
H.M.A.S. Australia with her attendant vessels
on the tragic twelfth of April, Bryant
was evidently suffering from having to paint to order,
but he has put some sound work into the old battle-
cruiser, and has set down an interesting if rather too
literal historical record. Alfred Coffey and Lloyd
Rees show pictures already seen in one-man exhibi-
tions. Rees is most successful in the play of light
on the solid stonework in “The Old Barn,” and in a
couple of other canvases he promises good things in
the treatment of old gum-trees ; but he has so far an
irritating indefiniteness in his handling of foliage.
J. W. R. Linton sends from Westralia a rocky rise
shadow-flecked in early morning light which has
patches of good painting in it, but a hesitant fumbling
elsewhere spoils its general effect. Jas. A. Crisp has
an excellent study in “Cockatoos,” and there is a fairly
strong still-life section in which Jackson, Marion Per-
rier and the late G. F. Harris are prominent.
The water-colors, beaded by Lister Lister and Frank
Coffey (who has also a couple of conscientious por-
traits in pastel), are an even lot, though the average
is not high. Laura Booth has some well-done tran-
scripts of old Sydney, Olive Birkenhead a couple of
attractive pieces, Frank Payne a clever little glimpse
of a Chinese garden from shadows of a shed, and
Winifred Caddy a promising study of an old building
keeping a decrepit tree company on a well-lit slope.
Among the etchings there is nothing better than Sid
Long’s “Kookaburras” ; an interesting item is a brace
of color-prints with an individual touch by A. B.
Webb, of Westralia; and Margot Holden has a vital
study of a pulling horse in the sculpture section.
The house which greeted Allan Wilkie’s
return to Melbourne at the New Palace last
Saturday looked like the reward of virtue
in a painstaking and courageous actor-man-
ager. It was packed even to the back corner-
seats of the d.c., and. encouraged by its ap-
preciation, the Wilkie co. gave a better
“Merchant of A'enice” than this Showman
has seen in several previous inspections of
the same goods by the same co. Although
the “Merchant” is the “East Lynne” of
Sliakspearean plays, the commencement
augured well for a season of nightly changes,
in which “Cyinbeline,” “Hamlet” and “The
Winter’s Tale” were billed to follow, with
“As You lake It,” “A Midsummer’s Nighi:
Dream,” “Twelfth Night,” “Much Ado About
Nothing,” “Macbeth,” “The Tempest” and
“Julius Caesar” on their heels. Incidentally,
Saturday night’s event was Wilkie’s 1041st
consecutive Sliakspearean performance.
* # ■» *
Wilkie has not varied his interpretation
of Shy lock by so much as a voice inflexion :
it still adequately shows how the Jew’s sense
of insult and injustice finds concentrated
expression in hatred of Antonio (Augustus
Neville). This Antonio, though strangely un-
moved by the prospect of losing a pound of
flesh, has dignity and power. The difficulty
of attuning the serious-minded lady who can
successfully pose as a learned doctor of the
law before the High Court of Venice with
the Portia of the ring incident was not as
satisfactorily solved by Miss Hunter-Watts
as it has been by some others. Leslie Man-
ners did well as Bassanio; Ellis Irving
(Lorenzo), possessing a voice of excellent
quality, gave due value to his poetical pass-
ages (“How sweet the music sleeps upon
this bank”), and received good support from
Miss Kiore King as Jessica; and minor
changes in the cast appeared to be for good.
After the performance, in a speech which the
audience vociferously demanded, Wilkie an-
nounced that 240,000 Australasian child-
ren, for whom special concessions are made,
have been given an introduction to Slmks-
peare through the co.’s performances.
Mr. Battling Butler puts away his gloves
on Saturday, and, with “The Rise of Rosie
O’Reilly” on the horizon, Melbourne New
Princess’s goes into a five-days’ recess.
Melbourne is taking the opportunity of
seeing the last of Madge Elliott, and
“Whirled into Happiness” continues to whirl
houses into Her Majesty’s. No change is,
therefore, projected until the new lady
arrives.
Beyond the change mentioned last week,
when Belle Onora and Hooker and Nugent
were brought in to supersede a couple of
less satisfactory turns, there lias been found
no occasion to alter the vaudeville programme
“GOOD MORNING, DEARIE,” AT
SYDNEY ROYAL.
GIMPY (Run Agar) : “A cyclone? What’s

girl with the 20-million-(or so)-dollar legs;
and the repeated statement of some laughter-
squirming d.c. neighbors that she is “a trick
seems to supply a good description. Du
Calion continues to be loquacious from the
top of his ladder, Rosie Lloyd is still amus-
ing, and “the girl with the violin, ’ Maggie
Foster, adds a turn which is always accept-
able.
That the hotchpotch of cheerful idiocy,
slick dancing and sundries of a “vaudeville
review” makes a wide appeal was shown by
the swelling of Fuller’s Melbourne house-
returns which welcomed a co. headed by
Doddv Hurl. Doddy has been with I uller s
for a couple of years, but has spent a good
deal of it in M.L., and meantime other
vaudevillains, after the cheerful habit some
df them have got, have “pinched” his goods.
'Hie discovery led to changes in the revue at
the last minute. Doddy still had some good
gags left, and deserves a cheer for refraining
from foisting on the public goods of which
audiences have already tired.
Three Melbourne Art Shows :
The influence of Hilder is strongly marked in
\V. M. Whitney’s water-colors at the Athenjeum.
There is inequality in the 43 pictures, but the best
of them show an excellent suggestion of time and
season in atmospheric treatment. “Winter Sunshine,
Austinmer,” for instance, gives a feeling of the
dampness of the grass in the shadow of the trees.
There is a suggestion of lushnass in “Green Pastures,
Berry” ; and “Trevallyn, Launceston,” is a good study
of a sunlit distance seen from a foreground of shadow.
The boldest in conception is “Dobroyd Headland,
Sydney Harbor,” in which there is living movement
in the fall of the wave. The artist shows a partiality
for looking upon his ’scapes through trees whose
branches obtrude in the foreground, an effect which
i 3 frequently but not invariably decorative; and
there is carelessness of perspective in some of his
work —for instance, “A Summer’s Day, Sydney
Harbor.”
Alice E. Norton (Mrs. F. A. Stephens) is a
Sydney artist who is making a descent upon Mel-
bourne for the first time. Her show is at the Fine
Art Society’s Gallery. A tendency to the over-use
of blue tints makes some of the pictures harsh;
but taken altogether the 50 catalogued pictures are
a nice selection of wall decorations, and there are
a few studies unnumbered in the catalogue that
deserve mention. “Sydney’s Gateway” shows a force
which is missing from most of the others, and in
No. 3 the coming of the day on Sydney Harbor is
excellently suggested. An ability to make the
atmosphere tell a story is exhibited in some of the
smaller pictures ; and there is a touch of inspiration
in “The Path That Leads You On,” and “Autumn.”
Leslie Wilkie, a young Victorian, has a small
exhibition at Margaret McLean’s studio in Collins-
street which shows considerable versatility but im-
maturity of technique. The best that can be said
is that it gives promise of much better. The por-
traits are lifeless, the nearest approach to any emotion
being the mingled suggestion of boredom and im-
patience in the eye of “Verona,” who appears to be
giving a hint to the artist to get on with the job.
Despite the technical immaturity and a general im-
pression that many of the canvases were painted in
a hurry, some of the other pictures indicate an
artistic conception which may carry the artist
further than others who do not show his faults.
“Evening” has a good effect of failing light caught
On the walls of an old building; and the strong
contrast of shadows within with the warm sunshine
without in “The Open Doorway” is fine.
The biggest feature of Melbourne filmdom
during last week was Baby Pat Wilson, the
Melbourne infant who won a first in the
Empire baby competition. She has been
presented in her self-possessed little person
at sundry shows, and screen versions show-
ing her eating breakfast and performing
other wonderful feats have flickered here
and there. “The Law Forbids” is at Hoyt’s;
and anything the law forbids is always a
powerful attraction.
Dickens is having an innings in the Adel-
aide theatres. Jackie Coogan is very popu-
lar on the screen, at the York, as Oliver
Twist, while Bransby Williams, at the Royal,
is both Sikes and Fagin, besides Micawber
and many others. Also on the Royal bill is
one Louis, a musician who turns to comical
account loose limbs and an apparently dis-
connected jawbone. Music is going strong.
Cellini, Cimara and Zacharewitscli, dropping
in at the Town Ilall, gradually worked up
small audiences to large and enthusiastic
ones. The Prince of Wales’s has a regular
opera season, of the popular order, with a
local co. drilled and headed by the sonorous
Filippini, his wife conducting the orches-
tra. It is a plucky venture, and is meeting
with good support. The Majestic has a good
variety bill, in which the shooting of the
lady who calls herself Rosie Rifle is the most
unusual item. At the Pav. is Tom Mix
(with horse), at Wondergrapli Betty Comp-
son in a Galsworthy adaptation, at West’s
the new all-English heroine Betty Balfour
in a’Parliamentary absurdity.

MUMMERS’ MENUS.
[For The Bulletin.]
“Charles Kean used to eat pork when about to
play a tyrant part, beef before a murderer’s r6le, and
mutton when he had to be the hero in a love scene.”
The Juvenile Lead:
Now, by my halidome, I am no glutton
Whene’er the meat I have to eat is mutton. •
But needs must! Mawkish lovers, how I loathe them!
Yet my admirers say with Art I clothe them.
How is it done —that I in roles so quiet
And sugary score ? The answer’s simple—diet!
The melting mood comes o’er me, 1 must nurse it;
Mutton’s the dish, and I must eat it, curse itl
The Tragedian:
.Ho, for the beef, floating in gravy ruddy!
Roast sirloin underdone! A murderer bloody
I must enact to-night. Gadzooks, I’ll do it
As ne’er before —the food will see me through it!
So rarest beef, I prithee, bring unto me ;
A rai-e performance it shall be, beshrew me!
Anon you’ll see my brows with laurels leafy;
Thrice d —d be he who says my acting’s beefy!
The “Heavy Gentleman”:
Bring forth the viands, varlet! I’d be tackling
Eftsoons stuffed roast of pork with heaps of crackling 1
Dost hear me, myrmidons ? Obey when I rant!
To-night, odsfish, I’m starring as a tyrant!
All those who live to please must eat to live;
The Drama’s laws the njummer’s cues must give.
Roast pork, I say! ’Twill cause a mood Satanic.
All hail, Dyspepsia! Make me tyrannic!
victoria. EARDLEY TURNER.
“A.P.”: “Cymbeline,” revived by Allan
Wilkie, had not been seen on the Melbourne
- stage for over 40 years. Louise Pomeroy
gave it at the Royal on her first visit
in 1880, playing Imogen herself. Flora
Austed was the Queen, Hoskins the Bel-
arius, and Carey lachimo. Others of the
old brigade were Mortyne, Appleton, C.
Brown, C. Holloway and Bland Holt. The
American put on “A Winter’s Tale” in
the following year, appearing as Perdita and
Ilermione, with W. 11. Leake as Leontes,
Docy Stewart and Mrs. Bland Holt as the
two shepherdesses, Bland as Autolycus, and
11. N. Douglas as Florizel. The occasion was
marked by the unfolding of John Hennings’s
noted act-drop, “Thespians Leaving Deso-
lated Greece.”
“Ex-Englishman”: Joseph Harker, the
great scene-painter, in his new book of remin-
iscences, “Studio and Stage,” tells a story
of Beerbolim Tree, who employed him freely,
but took leave to disagree with his occasional
lavish coloring. Tree carried his view to
such lengths that one evening, in the country,
being asked to admire a vivid sunset, he ob-
jected that it was “in Joe Harker’s most
violent manner.”
THIS CURSED LACK OF CAPITAL.
FIRST ARTIST: “Gripes! Arthur has sur-
passed himself! Pork-pie, a bottle of
pickled onions an’ a bottle of ale!
Rattling good subject!”
SECOND DITTO : “Yes, I thought of a good
one myself, but I couldn’t afford the
models.”
“Dido”: George Rignold used to delight-
in a piece of criticism his Orlando in “As
You Like It” provoked from a member of
his company. Charles the Wrestler was
played by a Melbourne wrestler and weiglit-
tosser. One night a party behind the scenes
praised Rignold’s work in the hearing of the
heavyweight. The latter snorted aloud.
“Act!” lie cried. “Why, I’d toss him 12
times out of every dozen if they’d let me.”
“Pipkin”: They cannot stay away for
long. Ballet-mistress Minnie Hooper has
come back to the Firm after nearly two
years with the opposition management. She
will be associated with Harry Burclier in
launching “The Cousin from Nowhere” on
its public career.
“Nero”: Everyone who has done any
theatrical touring in Australia will remember
the late Fred Pollock, lessee of the Theatre
Royal, Adelaide, and his love of diamonds. He
had a really wonderful collection, and on great
occasions would bedeck himself with studs,
rings, watches, pins and even a diamond
watch-chain. When Melba first returned to
her native land, after having musically con-
quered the rest of the world, she gave a
concert in Adelaide, and Pollock, looking
like a cut-glass chandelier, was in the mana-
gerial box. Melba came on wearing her
diamonds, sang divinely, and the house went
mad. In the interval, George Musgrove,
who was managing the show, encountered
Pollock. “Well, Pol,” he said, “what do
you think of her?” “Wonderful, wonder-
ful !” was the renly. “Where the devil did
she get ’em all?”
“Pantagruel”: Tom Pol-
lard gave a start to many
actors and actorines who
have since become promi-
nent. My two are Jack
Ralston and Yvonne Ban-
vard. Ralston, a native of
Brisbane, lived for years on
the pilot station at Sea Hill,
near Rockhampton. He
joined the Lilliputians when
they visited that town, and
went on tour with them. He
was the King of Spain in
“Maritana.” Then he was
with J. C. Williamson, Ltd.,
for 11 years, and later on
he joined the Gilbert and
Sullivan Opera Co.; recently
he has been Franz Schubert
in the Firm’s production of
“Lilac Time.” Yvonne Ban-
vard started with the Lilli-
putians at the age of six,
appearing as Fifi in “The
Belle of New York.” Since
then she has taken all sorts
of parts in comedy and
drama; and of late she has
been with the Reynolds-De
Tisne Co. in Queensland.
Yvonne’s most notable
achievement was when she
played lead in “Peg o’ My
Heart” for over 400 consecu-
tive performances in Canada.
“Thersites”: “Ellae’s” idea of the actor
speaking direct to the people in the audi-
torium (B. 31/7/’24) is older than Shaks-
peare. The action of an Elizabethan play
normally took place in the midst of the audi-
ence; the playgoers were behind the mummer
just as much as they were in front of him.
Thus probability was not ruthlessly violated
by “asides” shoutdd over the head of the
victim, as the bulk of the audience beheld
the incident from the sides of the house. It
is this intimacy with the audience, character-
istic of Shakspeare’s plays, which makes
them suitable for an arena, but severely han-
dicaps them on the remote stage of the
modern theatre, as Oscar Asche and other
producers have discovered. The central posi-
tion of Shakspeare’s stage made it possible
for a couple of characters like Demetrius
and Philo in “Antony and Cleopatra”
to identify themselves with the other on-
lookers for whose benefit they could comment
on the whole scene.
“Yarra Ben”: A notable figure of the cir-
cus-ring was John Welby Cooke, who died in
Melbourne a day or two ago. Cooke came of
a long line of circus people, and in his time
was one of the most dashing of bareback
riders and acrobats. His jockey act was
never excelled in Australia. He was Wirth
Bros.’ ringmaster, as well as taking his turn
as equestrian, thoroughbred trainer and what-
not, for 35 years.
“Ancient Prompter”: A mysterious cable
from New York informs us that Margaret
Linden, an Australian actress, is bringing; a
suit against Robert Cutts, “a millionaire
theatre-owner and club-man,” claiming
250,000 dollars. It reads like a pitcher-story.
The lady was dining, so she asserts, with
the gentleman in a “gorgeous apartment” of
a 20-storey building in Park-avenue. Resist-
ing his obnoxious overtures, in the course of
which he became violent and struck her with
his fists, she took up a leather strap (these
“gorgeous apartments” are full of such
“props”) and beat him off. The Law Courts
will hear the rest of the moving tale. Mar-
garet is the good-looking brunette who ap-
peared in “Everywoman” some years back
(she was Vanity), and afterwards was the
beauteous heroine of many a Willoughby and
Marlow drama. Three other attractive dam-
sels of that “Everywoman” cast have since
made names for themselves—Maggie Dicken-
son. Enid Bennett and Dorothy Gumming.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Visiting three Melbourne
vaudeville shows, I heard one indifferent gag
(apropos of brief skirts enhancing the
view) delivered four times. At one
hall it was wheezed by successive
artists. I suggested to the manager
that one of the humorists might be re-
quested to avoid the repetition. “What’s the
use?” he said, disgustedly. “If you asked
one of these performers to cut something out
of his business you’d spoil his whole act.”
And probably he is right: the artist who is
intelligent enough to reconstruct his act as
occasion may require does not need such ex-
cisions : he keeps off the hackneyed stuff’.
“Hamfat”: A performer who is having his
first “rest” for 15 years, and in the Mel-
bourne Zoo, at that, is Rex, the King of
Beasts. The Zoo is his birthplace, but he
was sold to Perry Brothers’ Circus when only
a cub, and has been on the roads since 1901).
Now, grown too big for his caravan, Rex
lias been sent back to the Zoo until a new
den is built for him.
“Verri”: A recent par. on the death of
Richard Ganthony, who made a fortune out
of “A Message from Mars,” reminds me of
the story, persistently circulated many years
ago, that the “Message” was a crib. The
play, it was alleged, was the work of a
A MELBOURNE SUBURBAN FAMILY SALLIES
FORTH TO THE PICTURES.
“There have been over 20 hold-ups by gunmen in Melbourne
in the past month, and the epidemic still continues.”
Maoriland woman, then resident in London ;
she had handed her MS. to a friend who had
volunteered to get a competent opinion on
it: the friend falling ill. the play was lost.
The author after some time tried to recon-
struct it, so the story went, but before she
could do so the “Message” flashed into fame,
and in it she recognised her lost production.
I have heard this tale in M.L. and in Sydney.
Can anyone say if there was any truth in it?
“R.K.D.N.” : About the time that Gladys
Moncrieff, now in England, was assuring the
Australian public, per cable, that Josie Col-
lins, the English comic-opera star, would be
“too cold to appeal to Australian audiences,”
paragraphs were flying around the theatrical
columns of the newspapers that Josie was
going to make a trip here under a William-
son contract. Verily the Firm must be wish-
ing that its mummers would speak only
what is set down for them.
“Ibsensliaw” : Though the Kipling phrase,
“East of Suez,” is attached to Somerset
Maugham's play at Melbourne King’s, the
piece itself owes nothing to the famous
writer. Rudyard, indeed, unlike many of
his craft, does not feel that playwriting is
his metier. He is the author of only one
dramatic work that I can recall, and that was
a one-acter. Of course his stories have not
escaped the stage-adapter. “The Light
that Failed,” played here in the long ago,
made a passable play, and “Kim” has been
seen in America. But the fine flavor of the
Kipling dialogue is lost in the atmosphere of
the footlights.
“Orb” : In Sydney the other day I met Sam
Marks, once business manager for George
Rignold and other theatrical potentates, but
now living in retirement. I was bound for
a picture-show and lured Sam in with me.
He endured an hour or more of Hollywood’s
latest sob-stuff, “Don’t Throw a Lighted
Lamp at Mother,” or words to that effect.
Then he leaned towards me and spoke
sotto voce. “I say, old man,” he said, “I
didn’t really offend you when we met to-day,
did I?”
“Norbell”: Ernest Toller’s prohibited poli-
tical drama, which, according to “Lond.” (B.
7/8/’24), has arrived in London under the
label “Man and the Masses,” is to be pro-
produced at St. James’s Hall, Sydney, on
August 30 and September 1 and 2, under
the title of “Masses and Man.” Duncan
Macdougall, of the Playbox Theatre, is re-
sponsible.

Learn to Draw
If you wish to acquire a lucrative, pleasant
and refined occupation—learn to draw.
If you wish to amuse your friends and afford
yourself endless pleasure—learn to draw.
The Harry J. Weston
Postal School of
Drawing
is based upon the actual methods and experi-
ence of one of Australia’s foremost commer-
cial artists. It cuts out the drudgery and is
full of interest from the first lesson. It
teaches how to draw —not merely to COPT.
Many pupils have more than paid for their
course before it was completed by the sale of
their work.
Send three penny stamps to cover postage, and
we will forward you our illustrated Booklet,
“There’s Money in the Pen.”
It tells you all about the course, fees, etc.,
and gives examples of the lessons.

Another new MOON and the very pinnacle of automobile perfection. It is fitted
with 4-wheel HYDRAULIC Brakes, which, it is admitted, settle for all time the
niuch-discussed question of 4-wheel brakes. It also has Balloon Tyres, which give
that final degree of comfort to a well-sprung car.
There is not in the automobile world to-day a sweeter, truer job than the New

years... .Norman O’K.: Much obliged. We shall.

writer is not as honest as he ought to be...

new thought in it.... Edith B.: “Bookcase” con-

It jolts all over the place D.A.R.: Doesn’t make
our mouth water.... May M.; Not much of a yarn
as you’ve told it; but there are possibilities there.
.... Bellerive: How vivid the scene:—
A sensation prevailed in
The heart of the town
At the pranks of a heifer
Which rushed up and down.
People for safety
Pell-mell did retreat,
As she wildly careered
Towards Flinders-street.
Like a dare-devil beast
From a Wild West show,
She missed a tram by an inch
As she charged to and fro.
When a driver lassoed her,
Arid the sensation did cease,
Which had drew a large crowd
And a body of police.
....Boxer: Of the “seventeen years and one month’’
taken to produce it, we fear that upwards of 17 years
and 30 days have been wasted... . R.0.W.: So poor that
we can almost hear it shaking a begging b0x....

things in the old way. .. .A.F.J.: Thin descriptions

R.H. (Northam) : Can’t find any mirth in “The
Funny Undertaker”.... E.A.S.: Too feeble to walk.
... .K.W.C.: Not good enough... .H.K.: Horrible.
.... Len L.: Obvious stuff told by a poor method....
A.T. (Cremorne) : Tell the yarn if you have one :o
tell. That rambling is mere weariness.... Mombak :
It certainly has lyric quality:—
My husband is a brute,
You’ll agree ;
He well deserves the boot,
You will see;
As he doubled up his rnit
The brute he made a hit,
I hope you will net doubt
But he hit me on the snout '
And madly did I shout
In agony.

make the other poets jealous.... J.C.M.: The
“Engine Wheels” only do very ordinary things....

for us... . George D.: The verne hasn't enough
interest.... Twitch Stick: Too rough... .X.N.: Not
up to the mark... .B.H. (Yalpunga) : Commonplace
in poor rhymes T.11.T.: One is middling blank
verse; the other is not verse at all. .. .C.V.H.:
None strike u5....A.M. (Hatuma): Verse poor and
the yarn doesn’t get to anything.... Spero: The
“Gold” story has no mirth. .. .Binnie: The tale is
a dud and the verse is far too long for its interest.
. ...L.A.C.: Too slight.... Geoffrey P.: Not enough
in it....Magela B.: “Love” turns on a poor idea.

cliff) : The yarn is incredible and the verse weak. .. .

rejected... .F.M.J.: Poor imitation... .Zeton tes
kallias; Trite verse with the usual moral tag....
R.F.S.: Doesn’t strike us. ... L.O’N.: “Sacrifice”
keeps to dull commonplace. ...Jackardy: Verse does
not carry the ideas. .. .P.C.C.: Not enough work
put into it W.J.8.: Far too crude and lumpy.
G.R.H.: They miss F.J.F.: Melodramatic.
. ...J.S.M.: The first rule of writing is, “Get som.-
thing to write about”.... Reppils: A weather-beaten
subject; and you’ve gone so far away for a peg to
hang your verses on. . . .M.F.R.; Nothing much wrong
with it, and if The Bulletin were elastic it would
be gladly printed A.J. J.T.: Crushed 0ut....
Scran: Your ear is out of tune Kenneth I.: A
lightweight.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
1.R.W.: Some promise; but you’ve a long way
to go yet. Still, you’ll probably find the journey
interesting R.M. : Indian ink, pen, paper and
ability to draw are required. You’ve got only
three of them. .. .A. 8.; Crude treatment. .. .L,D.:
Clumsy theft from London Punch. .. .K.O’M:

drowned in a flood of ink K.L.: Beauty may
draw with a single hair; you seem to have tried
to do it with a mop M.S.P.: No animal like
that ever came out of the Ark.
“T. 0.1.”: “The Cottage of Content” (B.
31/7/’24), in the ’Loo (Sydney), was an
ancient pub. There were three other N.S.W.
inns with a similar shingle—one on Cook's
River-road ; the second in Pitt-street, Water-
loo ; the third in Liver pool-street, city.
“Shed Hand” : Ike works in my gang in
the goods-slied, and he has been on the
lookout for any spilled fertiliser ever since
he planted his front lawn. Just when he
had got the grass nicely rooted and spread-
ing, he came upon a heap of atrociously-
smelling powdery stuff in an otherwise empty
truck. Gathering his find into a bag he
carried it home and spent Saturday after-
noon spreading it on his green, afterwards
putting on the sprinklers to make smv it
got to the roots. That night he couldn’t
sleep properly because of indefinite noises.
In the morning he found out what had caused
them. His lawn had been torn and scratched
up by all the cats in the neighborhod in their
desperate efforts to - eve sm-an nf the
meat-meal that had been perfuming the
neighborhood.

This Plumber Knows
He has had the handling of too many
jobs to overlook the importance of
getting the very best of materials for his
Plumbing work.
Miles of Piping of varied sorts passes
through his hands for the different classes
of work, and he goes to considerable
trouble to find the most reliable kind.
But when it comes to ordering the Mall-
eable Fittings, on which is staked the
success of his whole work—he never
hesitates, but demands —J—GF |—, the
Fittings which are unfailingly up to stand-
ard and reliable to the utmost.
Not only are they of less weight than
Wrought Fittings, but are more accurate
both in fit* and angles; further, their
larger variety of patterns enables install-
ations of all kinds to be executed more
quickly, technically more correct, and
their flawless make and perfectly parallel
threading invariably saves from 25 to 50
per cent, in the fitting-up labor alone.

A Horse Can Tell
IMMEDIATELY the difference be-
tween the old-style hub and the modern
SKF 1 Ball-bearing Axle. He starts off
without strain, and he keeps going with
little effort.
This means more haulage per day, and
more working days by the same horse
the year through, because he keeps in
condition. SKF Ball-bearing Axles
mean that every horse you own becomes
equivalent to at least a horse and a
half, thus allowing of more work at,
same keep or selling of your horses with-
out reducing the capacity of your trans-
port.
SKF Ball-bearing Axles affect the horse-
owner's pocket in the right way—in dis-
tinct £ s. d! savings.

for propaganda work and to attract patron-
age. The din when the howlers meet in
the city is awful to listen to.
“Uramao”: The kauri-gum industry is a
little goldmine for Maoriland. To date
over £20,065,287 worth has been exported
from the Dominion, most of it won by indi-
viduals and small parties. As there is more
kauri-gum in the ground than ever came out
of it, the plan now under consideration to
exploit the fields with machinery designed
for the purpose should give valuable returns.
* * * *
“Askarri”: Recently I noticed a couple
of celluloid kookaburras attached by spring
clips to a clock. The novelty so tickled my
fancy that I detached one to admire him
more closely. The same damning old label —
“Made in Japan”! It’s enough to make a
self-respecting old jacky give a final hollow
laugh and throw himself off a high gumtree.
And even then some fat-headed fool would
probably call it hara-kiri.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: Ratoon cotton in Queens-
land got a free ad. the other day in the dis-
covery that on the old pilot station near
Cape Iveppel there are four cotton shrubs in
full bloom. They were planted nearly half
a century ago by one of the pilot hands;
they never at any time received much atten-
tion, and none at all since the station
was left uninhabited six years ago. The
shrubs are healthy, and are totally free from
insect pests.
* * * •
“Harold Hardupp”: There was an inter-
lude at the letter-delivery counter of the Mel-
bourne G.P.O. when a wild-eyed person made
a desperate attempt to scale the wire en-
tanglement dividing the delivery clerks from
the public, intimating the while that by the
help of the Deity he meant to get his letters.
Pulled down and asked to explain himself,
he declared that the vermilion thieves had
199 letters of his which they refused to de-
liver. A letter which he produced explained
his delusion. It was marked “200 posted.”
* * * #
“Alwyn”: Divers went down in Sydney
for the first time on February 19, 1841. ten
months after the arrival of a diving-bell. A
w'eek later they began on the remains of the
Ann Jameson, which had been an obstruction
to shipping in Sydney Cove for over seven
years. On March 31 the bell commenced
a long career of usefulness in building
the substantial stone wall which exists
around the south and south-eastern portions of
Circular Quaj r . That values were different
in those days is evidenced by the fact that
the men on the hazardous job received one
shilling per hour for a three-hour day.
“The Rumpus”: “Gouger” may be told
that his mountain of garnets on Cape York
Peninsula (B. 19/6/’24) is of less commer-
cial value than a load of blue metal to a
Chow with bad boys in the offing. Practically
all over the nor’-west of Westralia these self-
same red stones are to be found, and many
dreams of untold riches have been born of
them, only to be shattered. I saw millions of
them w r hile after alleged amethysts with Jock
Campbell in 1905. The amethysts were found
all right—a whole hill of them, semi-trans-
parent, black, white, pink, violet —but when
the world’s verdict came to hand it was found
that they had no commercial value.
* * * *
“Lou” : The prices ruling for fat sheep in
the Brisbane saleyards make the far-out
sheepman’s mouth water in seasons like the
present, when abundant grass has put flesh
on toothless ewes. Hitherto the distance has
been regarded as prohibitive, but now the
railways are offering special concessions, and
a few men are taking risks with big consign-
ments : 2500 fat wethers went from Hugli-
enden in one lot a few days ago, the biggest
consignment yet despatched on a train jour-
ney of four days and nights. If they reach
their destination in good condition there will
be new possibilities for out-back graziers.
Could the mutton be untrucked halfway and
fed and watered, men even further out than
this would take a risk.
* * # *
“Nirnshi”: Something new in the way of
confidence tricks was worked the other day
on the trustful population of Goondiwindi
(Q.). A new and stony-broke arrival in the
township, after he had cleaned up his dole
of police rations and whatever else in the way
of free beer and scran was obtainable, coi-
lected into a quiet place all the rags he could
find, set fire to them, and then failed most
conspicuously to quench the conflagration.
The crowd that gathered listened sympatheti-
cally to his tale of a burnt-out camp, and his
piteously reiterated “Lost me tent, me swag
an’ a lotta other property” led to a prompt
subscription-list. It wasn’t till he had
got clear away with the benefactions of the
charitable that it leaked out that he hadn't
possessed either tent or swag, and that one
of his boasts was that he had never “done
a stroke” for 30 years.
* * * #
“Mouldy Ribs”: At certain reinforcement
camps in Blighty one could buy the privilege
of being the best-turned-out man on parade.
Our C.O. hit on the bright idea of offering
48 hours’ special leave and a free pass to
7,ondon for the two best-dressed men falling
in. It worked well for about a week; after
that all but two fell in dressed as usual, and
those two were like Victoria-street M’s.P.
An enterprising officer’s dingbat, assisted by
a q.m. sergeant, worked the oracle. As
soon as the guard was detailed Dingbat
would interview its members. “Anyone
want 4S hours’ special?” was his open-
ing. There would be a chorus of affir-
matives, strongly worded in most cases
and then, “Well, is it worth a quid?”
If no quids were about ten bob would
do the trick, or even a dollar The
enterprising pair kept half a dozen full rig-
outs in spotless condition, warranted to fff
almost any Digger at a moment’s notice and
let only two out at a time on the under•
standing that they wrnuld be returned imme-
diately the selections had been made. For
another pound, however, it was possible to
hire the rigofit for the leave.

It came as a shock to some of Prendergast’s
colleagues to note that they had been ap-
pointed because his Ex. relied on their
“loyalty, integrity, learning and ability.” It
was the “learning” that knocked them: they
were prepared to hear the rest.
Chas. Wemyss, the 70-year-old shire coun-
cillor and auctioneer of Yarrawonga (Vic.),
is known as “Old Charlie.” Yet his father
still lives, and lately celebrated his
100th birthday in a Melbourne suburb. The
veteran takes a trip annually to Yarrawonga
to see that his son is getting into no scrapes.
“Magrom”: The main street rapidly ap-
proaching completion at Barmera, a soldier
settlement on the Murray, is a fine concrete
highway. Originally it was intended to call
the thoroughfare Barwell-avenue, but now,
since the S.A. change of Government, “Gunn-
alley” has been suggested.
Died in England, at 85, Robert Sayers,
an old-time identity of Broken Hill —like a
good many others he made his rise there in
a pub. Trained as a youngster at sea during
the Crimean War, he came to Australia and
worked on the S.A. railways until the Barrier
called. For many years past he had been
living in his native Suffolk.
Vic. Labor has now 12 of its 27 Assem-
bly members nicely provided for. Prender-
gast, Tunnecliffe, Slater, Lemmon, Bailey,
Hogan, Webber and Cain are Ministers;
J. W. Billson and Solly are on the Railway
Committee; Clough and Murphy are on the
Committee of Public Accounts. In the Coun-
cil the proportion is even better. Out of its
six in that chamber four —Jones, McNamara,
Beckett and Disney—are Ministers.
The latest parson to be registered for the
celebration of marriages in Vic. is Robert
Ernest Oswald Finger, an Anglican. Know-
ledge of human nature and of the Shiels
Divorce Act may deter him from pasting on
his marriage-service book Omar’s verse:—
The Moving Finger writes, and having writ
Moves on ; nor all thy piety nor wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a line,
Nor all thy tears wash out a word of it.
A day or two before Melbourne Gaol was
vacated on July 30 the staff found, enclosed
in an envelope, the quill-pen used by Ned
Kelly during the period before his execution.
J. B. Castieau (whose son is on the central
staff of the Penal Department to-day) was
governor of the prison at the time Ned was
hanged, and his certificate on the envelope
authenticated the relic. The pen was keep-
ing company with plaster casts of several
malefactors.
A picture with pride of place in the library
of the Commonwealth Parliament is Low’s
drawing for The Bulletin’s cartoon of the
Imperial Conference (1907), illustrating a
rampageous Billy Hughes punching the Coun-
cil table, while Asquith and Lloyd George
cower at the other end ready to follow the
others through the door or under the table.
The skit struck the fancy of Gov.-Gen.
Munro-Ferguson, who bought it; and the in-
scription on the frame shows that he pre-
sented it to the Commonwealth Parliament.
Adelaide’s best-known scholarship, the
Angas Engineering—one of the earliest win-
ners was the now-famous Prof. Hudson
Beare —goes this year to C. D. Gibb, of the
Port. After winning the gold medal at the
School of Mines, he enlisted in the Austra-
lian Flying Corps, on his return was
made instructor at the School of Mines, and
subsequently collected a B.E. degree. At
present he is with the Parsons Turbine Co.
at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and contemplates a
course of study in America before returning
to Australia.
“Alwyn” : Apropos quaint house-names, the
late Phil Sullivan, who represented Darling-
ton in one N.S.W. Parliament and Phillip
in another, was the owner of a modest week-
ender at Port Hacking, which he dubbed
“Navillus.” On one occasion several of his
Labor colleagues, including the late Jim
McGowen and W. A. Holman, accompanied
him down to this retreat. Arriving, the visi-
tors immediately began to comment on the
imposing title. Holman in particular was
greatly puzzled, and after wrestling with the
classics for some minutes confessed he was
beaten. Then a member of the party whose
knowledge of Latin was nil had a brain-
wave. “Blow me, boys, if it ain’t ‘Sullivan’
spelt backwards!”
W. P. Reeves, appointed chairman of the
National Bank of New Zealand, has had a
varied career. Starting as a journalist,
though entered at the time as a barrister, he
became editor of the Canterbury Times
and Lyttelton Times, and then chairman
of the Wellington Times. Next he turned,
with socialistic leanings, to politics, entered
the Reps, in 1887, and was the first Minister
for Labor to sit in a M.T Cabinet. That
was in the Ballance-Seddon days, when the
portfolio was created. He resigned to take
over the job of Agent-General, and from
that went to the Chair of Economics at the
London University. In between times he
was a member of the Pacific Cable Board, of
the Commercial Intelligence Committee of
the English Board of Trade, and of the Eng-
lish Commission on Shipping Rings. He
has written acres—including some verse. As
a cricketer and footballer he represented the
Canterbury (M.L.) province; but that was
long ago. To-day he is 67.
“T. 0.1.” puts back the clock:—
The recent meeting of representative Australian
booksellers in Sydney recalls a couple of old-timers
in the trade who built up big businesses from very
modest beginnings. Jeremiah J. Moore, a cord-
wainer by calling, arrived in Sydney about 85 years
ago. A small man, with a musical Irish brogue,
he saw possibilities in the second-hand book trade,
and started by visiting each immigrant ship arriving
in port and purchasing, usually for a trifle, books for
which the passengers had no further use. He fixed
shelves against the old cemetery wall in George-street,
where he also ran a shoemaker’s business, so that a
customer who wanted his boots repaired could read a
book while he waited. Jerry prospered so much that
in 1862 his shop had become one of the finest in the
block and himself a large importer of books. He
was the projector of “Moore’s Almanac,’’ first issued
in 1852, and died wealthy. Henry Tolman Dwight
had for a bookstore in the early days of Melbourne an
ancient iron building which served as a buttress to
the Old White Hart Inn, at the top of Bourke-street.
He was a bachelor, asthmatic and reclusive. His
sole assistant was a spectacled man who paced up .and
down the pavement with the parrot-like cry “Books!
Books! Books.” Large baskets stood on the footway,
with contents marked 3d., 6d., 9d., Is. On his death
his stock amounted to 30,000 volumes; it was sold
under the hammer,

N
Girls!
Imagine your
Complexion Clear,
Rosy and Velvety!
Are you sometimes discouraged and feel
that your skin is unattractive instead of
being clear, fresh and smooth? If so, look
to the soap you are using.
Many soaps are more injurious to the
skin than actual neglect, for they contain
harmful alkali, which tends to dry up
the skin and destroy its delicate texture.
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is a speci-
ally prepared skin soap, entirely free from
harmful alkali. It will do more to im-
prove your skin than you ever thought a
soap could do, for it is medicated on the
same principle as the famous Rexona
Ointment. Thus it is able to exert the
hygienic effects of Rexona upon the skin
with every cleansing operation.
Simply use Rexona Soap onee or
twice a day, and see if it does not
relieve the clogged pores, reduce the
tendency to blotches, redness and
oiliness and leave the complexion
clear, rosy and velvety.
“I have used Rexona Soap to my
entire satisfaction, and find _it
delightfully refreshing and soothing
to the skin.”

T ▼ I saw the morning smoke rise
pale and blue, ...
Column on column, out of groves tlia S l *''
About low gables, where the orchard spun
A patterned lace of boughs aboye the du
Of furrows, and the moist turned earth was
To fondling airs and the chill kiss of dew
And all the gladness ot the day begun.
Smoke beyond smoke; and every smoke a

On tile soft steps of memory I went down
To many doors and many kindling hres,

So morning came to ancient druid woods
Before the earliest huntsman wound lus horn.
The little smokes went up where, steeped
in corn,
Old mellow valleys under the green hoods
Of oak-plumed hills lay snug Irom all the
moods
Of the great winds, ere cities rose to scorn
'Plie bread-fields out of which their stones
were born—
Earth’s meaningless and clamorous inter-

Man’s labor in the fields is one deep song
Sung to the rhythm of Spring and harvest-

Above a thousand cities overthrown
The winds have written doom; the golden

To dust is dust. The desert claims her own ;
And each new street speaks in the desert’s

For all the weight of longing on its breast.

Of all that grows beyond its trodden ways!
Old rural mirth dies at the market’s cry,
The morning has a price upon its sheen,
Where the brave sun walks high through

The brown earth is embittered with a lie.

T think the city madness cannot stand
When trumpets of a clearer thought shall
blow
Around the walls of this doomed Jericho
Of noise and fret that to the morning bland
Lifts impious cliffs wrought of the hardened
sand,
Setting the desert endwise for a show 7
To the old sun and stars that smile and know
What the years gathered from the mason’s
hand.
Surely a tall man walking by his plough
Shall find again the grace of ampler years
When the heart melodies of life awoke!
Surely, beneath some happy greenwood
bough,
The happier song shall be in happier ears
When clean home altars lift their morning
smoke.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
DENNY DENEEN, J.P., was going
south as a delegate to the Sydney
Conference of Justices of the Peace;
and Puttifoot had been made temporary
master of Denny Deneen’s butcher’s shop.
Micky ruled the chores and the orchard; the
long grocer governed the store, and the bar-
man became Lord of the Hotel, King of
the Beerpump and lessor of Deneen’s Social
Hall.
“Be a good man, Bill Puttifoot,” Denny
had urged in a valedictory to his retainers,
“an’ whin the boss is jokin’ wit’ you, laugh
you at the joke. An’ you, Jack Galvin,
don’t sell more than wan glass of beer to
Uncle the bellman on wan day; ’tis' his
confused brain will make him ring the bell
In a foreign language if he have two pints.
An’, Micky, look you afther the orchard an’
the cows an’ the pigs an’ chooks, an’ run
your arrints for Misthress Deneen, an’ see
the Social Hall be clean for the night th%y
play the pictures, God help you! An’ Mis-
thress Deneen will keep an eye on the shtore.
An’ so ivery wan to his occasion an’ his
lawful toil.”
So Denny Deneen went south, and the
township began to play like children at
school when the teacher’s back is turned.
Puttifoot was seen driving the butcher’s cart
in the Upper Settlement with Mrs. Choquin-
die beside him on the front of the meat-
chariot ; the long grocer gave chocolate to
ladies in business hours; and Micky like-
wise had his distraction. He bought a
hoi-se.
The horse was a tall stallion of tremendous
bone and bottom. He was the sort of horse
that with all the feeding in the world would
never fatten; a vast, rangy bay, and as
good as he didn’t look. All that bone had
,come off limestone country, and there was
blood with it and the mildness of a curate.
The bay could walk with the best, but on
a journey he had but one speed, a long,
swinging canter which was maintained up-
hill, downhill and on the level. Micky had
got him for seven pounds ten, saddle and
bridle thrown in, and a piece of dirty
paper with strange marks and writings show-
ing the alleged pedigree of Barbed Wire.
Micky worshipped this work of iiction —
carried it with him; showed it to all men ;
and woe be to him who laughed as he read.
He stabled the horse with Denny's own,
and rode where he had walked —rode his
own horse proudly to the orchard, and there,
full of the joy of a horse that could not
be still, chased Tim the Pensioner until that
misanthropic animal showed the whites of
his eyes and stopped to kick with both hind
feet at once. Micky also rode Barbed Wire
after the milch-cows —not very long after,
either; the lunatic animals going before
Barbed Wire at a clumsy gallop and arriving
at the milking-shed red-eyed with fear and
their milk in a fever. But these were in
the day’s work, and Barbed Wire knew the
full enjoyment of life only when between
the morning and the evening duties Micky
rode out to Troy, a gatehouse on the railroad
seven miles south, the Helen being the gate-
housekeeper’s small and freckled daughter,
aged 15, and all knees and elbows. Before
the purchase of Barbed Wire, Micky’s visits
had been for Saturday afternoons and Sun-
days only; he had made them daily occa-
sions for the last three days of Denny’s
absence, and on the morning of the fourth,
having rushed his morning job. he cantered
up to Troy gatehouse at half-past nine.
Helen of the Freckles had a moment be-
fore closed the gates to crossing traffic for
the train from New South Wales. Dis-
playing much length of ungraceful legs she
now rode the western gate to its closing;
and, still sitting on the top of the gate, said:
“H’lo, Micky. Bring any lollies V”
“My word !”
Helen ate at his hand, and conversation
was meaningless as they chewed.
“Rain cornin’?”
“Not on y’ life —the glass is high in the
store.”
“The down goods train killed a pig lars’
night.”
"Cut him much
“On'y bits left, and pigs are, goats. This
one went to sleep on the line.”
"Come out all day Sat’deeV”
"Yairs. I got me brother’s ’orse.”
“Little creamy geldin’ with white feet 7”
“Yairs. My word, he’ll look tike a foal
next that big horse o’ yours.”
Loath to show ill-temper to the beloved,
but deeply resenting any criticism of . the
stature of Barbed Wire, Micky replied, with
all the loftiness his position justified, that
he liked a big horse —thirteen hands was too
small for any decent man to ride.
“There’s the train,” said Helen, escaping
controversy with all a woman’s suppleness.
“What’s it stoppin' forV”
“Inspector gettin" off to see about buildiif
a fruit shed.”
A long smoking-car found its position
immediately at the gate.
"It's a big train, Micky.”
“Ain’t it! We’ll go on that one of these
days, Mag.”
“Aw, go on.”
“My oath we will!”
“Oh, you will, will you? You’ll get the
morals of Quart Pot talked about as far as
Deepwater an’ Killarney, will you? On a
high horse as high as the Town Hall an’
hips on him like a telegraph pole, will you?
Where is your work this day? Where did
you sliteal that horse?”
“O me Gord!” gasped Micky.
“Who’s the bloke?” asked Helen the Irreve-
rent.
“Bloke, is it?” shouted Denny Deneen.
“ ’Tis I, Denny Deneen, Jay Pee, an’ I’ll be
sorrow an’ anguish to you, me bold bucko
Micky, whin I get to Quart Pot. Y've
shtole that horse, an’ 15 years is what you’ll
get and I’m on th_e binch.”
The train moved onward, and Micky could
have kissed the locomotive for its considera-
tion.
“And I'll put your Dublin Cashtle of a
horrse in the pound. Ho, me lad. wait till
I get you home!”
The train took him out of earshot, and
Micky with a nonchalance he did not feel
said “So long” to Helen on the gate, and
left Troy Crossing at a canter that soon
became a gallop. He did not fear Denny,
but he feared Denny’s tongue; and lie
wanted to meet him on the ground and not
on the ridiculous height of the horse. But,
on the four miles of direct railroad and the
mile and a half of drive from the station to
Quart Pot, Denny beat the horse of pedigree
by twenty minutes.
It was the best thing that could have hap-
pened. Denny had had time to find that
Micky’s ownership was honest, and that
Micky’s morning chores were well and truly
done, and in that altered mind was the
more prepared to admire Micky on his horse
of Gargantua riding at a gallop, free-swinging
and easy, up from Quart Pot Creek to the
township.
“No good gettin’ on to me,” said Micky,
striking for first blood. “I did me job and
the horse is mine.”
“Whin I shpoke to you at Troy Crossin’,”
said Denny, his hand on the enormous ani-
mal’s wither, “I was incinsed at you being
away from your job, and therefore I shpoke
wit’ a certain confushion of moind. ’Twas
a passin’ resintment; an’ Misthress Deneen
say you have been a good lad an’ attintive
to jooty; an’ we’ll let begones be begones.
Ye’ve all been good fellys; the long grocer-
man and Puttifoot an’ the barman —each
good in his own departmint. An’ that’s a
fine horrse ye have; not to luk at in repose,
because he have a head as tall as a light-
house an’ hips as high up as a semiphore on
the railway. But whin y’ have him canterin’
’twould be like bein ’on an arrm chair,, an’
his great gallopin’ knees heatin’ the winds,
man, Micky, he would carry you all day
that a-way, and every day, too, then.”
l, He’s a fine horse,” replied Micky, grate-
ful that his judgment was endorsed by the
authorities. “A good pedigree, too, he is. I
got it writ out. I’ll show it to yer. An’,
Mister Deneen, if y’d like to ride him ter-
morrow y’ can have him in the mornin’.”
“I will that, then,” said Deneen ; “I’m rul-
in' down to me tin-dredge t'morry. an’ tin
miles there he would gallop an’ tin miles
back he would canter, and then a man would
be swingin’ like a shlapin’ child in a ham-
mick betune the threes. T’morry I will ride

You cannot get away from accidents—and you
cannot get away from the need of Zam-Buk. Daily
examples of Zam-Buk’s swift, clean healing and its
great utility in a thousand emergencies justify the high
claims made for this herbal “first-aid” and skin balm.

Zam-Buk Soap, apply and bandage up.
Zam-Buk is superior to common ointments in this
respect—it has extraordinary soothing, healing and
antiseptic powers. There is nothing that is capable of
more efficient healing and curative action. These

ARM BURNT AND INFLAMED. — “I severely burned my arm on the
red-hot oven whilst cooking,” says Mrs. E. Mills, of 12 Mulvery Street, Richmond,
Victoria. “Large watery blisters formed which, when they broke open, caused
almost unbearable pain. To make matters -worse, blood-poison developed, and
inflammation gradually spread right up the arm to the shoulder. For two weeks,
despite all medical treatment, I suffered fearful agony.
“Then I was persuaded to use Zam-Buk, and even the first application proved
most soothing. Besides giving this instant relief, Zam-Buk brought large quantities
of poisoned matter out of the wound, causing all inflammation to speedily disappear.
I continued to treat the injuries with Zam-Buk, with the result that in little more
than a week they were all thoroughly healed, with new, healthy skin.”

your big Dublin Cashtle av a horrse, an’ go
to shlape whin he canters.”
Denny mounted the tall horse from the
shaft of the butcher’s cart, as advised by
Micky, and felt that the world was very
good. He would have eased up down the
hill to the creek, but Barbed Wire reefed
and took his own head in charge. In the
creek the great horse, surefooted as a cat,
reefed again and picked his way through
the stones as he cantered.
“Have your way, then,” said Denny* “Y’
have on’y wan pace, maybe, and it’s a good
wan; canter, then, canter—Free ha’pence for
tuppence, t’ree ha’pence for tuppence. Free
bridle and long white road, an’ sun shinin’;
an’ gallop, an’ gallop away.”
So rode Denny Deneen to the river flat
where his dredge lifted the alluvial, and
washed it, and vomited it after robbing it of
its tin.
He looked complacently at the bags of tin
oxide stacked for transport; then he looked
at the stallion, and, having completed his
business, led Barbed Wire to an old boiler
and by that route arrived at the saddle’
Then “Good-bye to you” and “So long” from
the dredge manager, and the armchair
method of transport was repeated.
At five miles out Denny, pulling the un-
willing horse to a walk, took out his tobacco
and filled his pipe. As he attempted to
light up Barbed Wire reefed hard and the
matches fell to the ground. Irritably cen-
sorious, Denny slipped from the saddle, re-
covered the matches and looked for a van-
tage to. remount. There being no other
thing high enough he chose the fence, placed
the horse along it fore and aft, climbed the
top rail, and found Barbed Wire at right
angles. to it. Denny cursed and pulled at
the reins; whereupon Barbed Wire backed
and pulled Denny with him. In the fall
Denny lost the rein ; the tall stallion looked
at him in surprise for a moment and then
turned and cantered away with his neck
extended and the reins hanging free.
And so Barbed. Wire galloped easily, joy-
ously over the hill and out of sight, and
Denny gave himself up to the inevitable and
walked towards Quart Pot enraged at the
humiliation the accursed animal had put on
him.
He reached Quart Pot late in the after-
noon, and hoping that none would know of
his adventure, went to the stables, and found
not Barbed Wire, but Micky, who greeted
him like a friend.
“Did he carry you well. Mister Deneen?”
He carried me Well. Oh, yes, he carried
me well.”
“He’d do well at the stud, Mister Deneen.
I bin wondering what ought I to cross him
with ?”
“If you cross his Front wit’ a sharp knife
you’d do t’ right t’ing.”
‘"Why, what’s -the matter?”
“He’s no horrse, that’s wliat’s the matter
Wl £ him. He’s a damn shot-tower.”
“Why, he’s on’y eighteen hands!”
He’s eighteen fut: eighteen yards. On’y
eighteen hands ! I know the pedigree uv’m!
He s by Lightnin’ Conductlior out of Shprring
Matthress. Dirrty tall mongrel uv a horrse
he is!”
“He’s no mongrel—he’s a blood horse.”
111 make a blood horrse uv him wit’ an
axe—whin I find him.”
“Find him ! Is he lost?”
“He ran away from me whin I had him
up agin a fince; an’ down he pull me off the
fince an’ took his bridle-rein in his mout’,
an up wit’ his insultin’ tail, an’ away he
go.”
“Then he’ll go down the river into Noo
kjouth! He was bred there. You’re respon-
sible,. Mister Deneen. He’s a pedigree horse,
an’ if he don’t come back or somebody
pinches him I’ll have the lor on you!”
“Ye 11 have, the law on me, ye little thin
slitreak of misery av a boy? Ye’ll ’ave the
law on me, you poor natural! How can ye
get the law on me an’ me a Jay Pee? You
an’ your pedigree av a shot-tower horse—
dam’ lot o’ lies on a dirrty bit uv paper
nobody would use to wipe a pig’s shnout

Sathurday nights goin’ home to your mother
under your arrm. I’ll make a blood horrse
av him if I ever find him. Have the law on
me!” '
“Too true!” replied Micky, full of resolu-
tion. “You see!”
* * * *
Morning again, and Denny sorry for the
day before;, for lie saw Micky, regardless
of his dismissal, going cheerfully about the
morning chores. He followed his employee
to the cowyard.
“Micky, ’tis a foine day, Micky.”
“Bonzer!”
“Micky, ’twas a very regrett’ble incidint,
then, yestherday. I would not insult your
horrse, though the divil abandoned me in
the cold, harrd, uninhabited bush.”
“It’s all right, Mister Deneen. He come
home in the night. When I got here this
mornin’ he was standin’ at the gate, saddle
an’ bridle on him, and not a strap broke.”
“That’s fine, Micky. Now, Micky, I meant
nothin’ by that little conversation we had.
You’re a good lad, Micky. An’ your horrse
is a good pedigree horrse and might have
Carbine blood in him for annything anny
man knows. He’s a fine tall horrse, too,
Micky; an’ annybody thryin’ to buy a tall
horrse. would have harrd wurrk beatin’ him
for height. An’ a thraveller could see more
av the worrld than off these little horrses,
wit’ the small horizons. Now, Micky, I’ll
tell you. Give me that paper wit’ his pedi-
gree on—an’ a dirrty bit av paper it is for a
clean horrse—an’ I will get that printed at
Warrick, an’ we’ll have that pedigree framed
an’ hang it up over Barbed Wire’s shtall,
so that he can see the lady and gintlemin
horses he came from, an’ hould his head up
wit’ the best. An’ there’ll be no horrse can
hould his head higher.”
“Thank yer, Mister Deneen—that’ll be
fine.”
“An’ a blood horrse he is, Micky, even if
he don’t cut himself.”
“Thank. yer, Mister Deneen.”
“An’ Micky, I shacked you lasht’ night—
an’ you’re shtill shacked at wages. But
I engage you agin at twenty-two shillin’s a
week an’ a pum’kin.”
“Thank yer, Mister Deneen.”
“An’ luk you here, Micky. The first time
you talk to me ag’in about havin’ the law
on me your pedigree horrse will be a blood
horrse all over him, an’ then you’ll find what
a serious t’ing it is to go to law wit’ a Jay
Pee.”
“Thank yer, Mister Deneen. I was only
jokin’.”
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Horsehair Period.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
IN the days when we were children there
existed for us a kind of physical and
spiritual regime so cold-bloodedly
administered as to allow of scarcely any
modification, no matter how much one sub-
ject might differ in nature from another.
The body and the soul were taught to keep
time in a sort of goose-step very exhausting
to little people just beginning to look out
of the nursery. For instance, I can remem-
ber Mrs. Grimm mixing me an aperient
while I repeated prayers to God at her dic-
tation. Sometimes, even now, in the midst
of a doze, I wake with a start, seeming to
hear the rattle of her spoon in a glass of
the vireseent mixture. And it is as well;
because I am reminded to attend to the pre-
sent needs of my stomach, though, perhaps,
not always so readily to the health of my
soul.
* * * *
Sundays: Eau-de-Cologne, pew varnish,
psalms, thrippences, dismal memorial tablets,
cocoanut-matting, blue organ-pipes bursting
into tomato-colored stars, choir-girls whose
soaped foreheads glitter in competition with
their spectacles, clergymen looking like
bruised pears under the stained windows,
squeaky boots and the smell of the vicarage-
cooking. Then home in processions; one
procession on each path of the village, and
the local flourmiller driving in a brougham
down the centre. The pub, the dressmaker,
the grocer, the chemist, the family butcher
—all shut. A turn in the road, followed by
another turn, and home. Dinner in the
middle of the day. Roast beef, roast pota-
toes, hasty-pasty pudding and glasses of
cold water. Behind the pittosporum hedge
seen from the verandah lovers keep passing
on the road that leads to the river. The
people over the way have visitors, and walk
about under Persian lilacs, smoking General
Gordon cigars. Children inside are singing
hymns to a flurried harmonium. Someone
hoists a brilliant Union Jack to the top of
a white flagstaff—the only cheerful thing
visible on the horizon.
At 4.30, after Sunday-school has finished,
the curate arrives on a bicycle which he
sticks up against a water-tap while he goes
into the drawing-room. He has been read-
ing “A Yankee at the Court of King
Arthur,” and we all now begin to wish that
Mark Twain had never been born. After
he has gone we have an early tea of swollen
scones and little bits of butter. Then the
bell starts ringing for evening service, and
off we go again. This time I am happier,
because Alice Dryden-Bell occupies a seat
to the sou’-west of me. Kneeling during a
prayer I can study her through my fingers,
and she rewards me with a curved, melan-
choly smile that makes my Waterbury watch
leap in its waistcoat-pocket. She has pale
hair reaching far down her back, and when
she tosses it like a lock of hay dozens of
bells ring on her bracelets. She is scented
to kill; but I want her very much, even in
despite of her brother, who is as black as
she is fair. Brother glares at me; his fist
on top of the pew seems a weapon laid there
only for the duration of the service. I
make up my mind to speak to Alice after
Nunc Dimittis, but my aunt needs me to
help her down the aisle, and so I have no
opportunity. Alice looks towards me as she
passes on her way to the gate, and I nearly
howl with rage. However, there is no help
for it. I continue beside my aunt, a thin
figure dressed in an Eton suit, an imitation
naval cap upon my head decorated with a
glazed peak.
Those were Victorian times and Victorian
ways. Children were perpetually manacled
to their parents or to their parents’ ser-
vants. There was never any freedom. Our
clothes were as ugly as the furniture.
Humph —the furniture ! Can anybody sigh
for the resuscitation of horsehair chair-
covers and horsehair sofas?

Via Dolorosa.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
WHEN I was yosng I strove to seek
The sweet Lord Jesus, high, yet
meek.
I cried my longing night and day
In “Jesus ! Jesus !” all of the way.
Upon the cold, grey kneeling stones
I groped by altar-stair and screen,
But found no mystic Man of Moans,
Nor where the marks of His feet had been.
I found, I found no marred young face
Hung in some lonely, windless place ;
For the only thing that I could see
Was a shy little bird that sang to me.
I sought an olden cross of wood,
All stained with blood for the world’s good ;
But the only thing that I could see
Was this —the white of a blossom tree.
I trod the Seven Ways of Pain ;
But, save sun gold in the gloom of rain,
The only things that I could find
Were the spreading trees and the singing
wind.
The wind went under open sky
With Beauty standing breathless by;
And the children’s laughter loud and gay
Filled all the air of the dolorous way.
If I have found no pierced feet,
No God-like forehead pricked and torn,
I have found the grasses running sweet
And the flower instead of the stark, black
thorn!

With Better Tractors.
MANY implements and machines have been made to aid the farmer in doing
his work efficiently and well, but none has ever realised such a measure
of usefulness as the tractor. It is essentially a machine of greater
production and greater profit'making for the farmer.
The CASE Tractor forms the ideal power for all farming operations. Not only
will it do more work in less time, but it will enable you to do two or more
operations at once, thereby reducing to a minimum the time required.
The CASE Tractor is not affected either by cold or heat. In rush seasons
it can be worked night and day, and needs no rest after hecivy pulls or because
of hot weather. It is easy to handle, and does not tire the operator. It
will enable you to plough deeper and prepare a better seed-bed; the ploughs
may be set at any desired depth, and there is no skimping when heavy places
are encountered.
Increased farming operations are made possible with the CASE Tractor.
Through its use you can put under cultivation land that you have not been
able to work because of lack of power; indeed many acres of unused brush
lands have been put under the plough and turned into valuable farm lands by
this powerful Tractor.
In hauling off logs and trees, pulling stumps, operating portable saw mills,
removing boulders and other field obstructions, CASE Iractors have demon-
strated unusual economy and adaptability.
There is no farm job, drawbar or belt, for which this Tractor is not well adapted.
Ample power for deep ploughing and more intensive working of the land,
reduction in labour costs, less worry, better farming and bigger profits—
these are guaranteed results which accrue from the intelligent use of a CASE
Tractor.
Investigate the merits of the CASE.
Get in touch with our nearest branch, or write for Catalogue.

Case Service
CASE Service is a tremen-
advanCage to owners. Spare
parts are always available
at any Branch, and being
interchangeable can be put

ease.
Rigid One-piece Frame
Assures Permanent Alignment of all
Bearings and Perfect Mesh of Gears
The main frame of the 15/27 CASE
Tractor is a one-piece casting, which also
forms the main part of the transmission
case, crank case and rear axle housing.
This construction allows all the bearing
seats for engine crankshaft, transmission
shafts and rear axle to be machined in
one operation, an ideal method of secur-
ing permanent alignment of shafts and
gearing.
Front axle is made of forged steel and is
of the automobile type. The axle is
braced in every position; either of the
front wheels will pass over a high obstruc-
tion without interference. The turning
radius of the Tractor is 1 The
steering gear is of the worm and worm
wheel type and is non-reversible.
Rear axle is of the one-piece live type.
It is made of the best carbon steel 2|
inches in diameter. The axle runs on
Hyatt Roller bearings, located close to
each main drive wheel and supported in
the main frame casting. The casting at
this point houses the axle and bearings
and forms a reservoir for oil so that both
bearings and axle operate in a bath of
oil.
