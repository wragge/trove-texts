Harvard University, U.S., registered by the Governments

to the special study of the CHRONIC and SKIN
DISEASES of MEN and WOMEN. All applying
to him will receive his honest opinion of their com-
plaints. No experimenting ; no mercury used. A posi-
tive cure guaranteed or forfeit £2OO. His vast experience
tells him that where there is no organic disease, and
nothing but an inorganic trouble, or, in other words, a
conglomeration of symptoms producing a certain result,
there is no reason why it cannot be removed with the
proper remedies : therefore he guarantees. He claims to
be the most skilful ana successful physician in N.S.W. in
his particular speciality, viz., the CHRONIC DISEASES
of MEN and WOMEN.
Examination and Advice Free to all.
Oflicc flours : 10 to 12 n.m. ; 2to 4 and
J to 8 p.m.
In consequence of the prevailing
HARD TIMES,
Dr. STEER has determined to REDUCE his FEES to
exactly ONE-HALF of those usually charged, and he
trusts tiiat this will prove itself
GOOD NEWS INDEED
to those thousands of poor but honest sufferers, who,
though willing to pay a small fee proportionate to their
means are quite unable to pay the enormous charges so
often made.
Dr. SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
curable case in band he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
completely cured It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.
NERVOUSNESS.
CONSULT Dr. SPEER in all cases of NERVOUSNESS
and WEAKNESS, for his many years of practice with
these diseases enables him to remove all traces of them,
and to return the victims to full VIGOR and HEALTH.
N.B.—TWENTY SHILLINGS is sufficient to
send for remedies necessary for the cure of
NERVOUSNESS and WEAKNESS.
In all cases of
WEAKNESS consult Dr. SPEER.
LIVER AND KIDNEY COMPLAINTS consult Dr.
SPEER.
ASTHMA consult Dr. SPEER.
BLOOD DISORDERS consult Dr. SPEER.
SKIN DISEASES consult Dr. SPEER.

at the Royal College of Physicians, where he
graduated with eclat. He then entered the Royal
College of Surgeons, where he also graduated with

extended tour of the world, visiting all famous
hospitals, devoting special attention to the study
of diseases which afflict the young and inex-
perienced. On returning, he directed his attention
to electricity as a healer ; and so proficient has he
become during the past 20 years that he is pre-
pared to guarantee to cure every accepted case,

MAKE HO CHARGE.
If you are subject to symptoms which you do
not understand, send for Dr. Burgoyne’s Com-
plete Treatise, entitled, “Nervous and Skin
Complaints,”
PRICE, ONE SHILLING.
This book is replete with useful hints to
sufferers, and even though you do not require
medical advice, you should send for a copy, if
solely for its
Prescriptions and Illustrations-
To avoid superfluous correspondence, intending
patients should be careful to describe all symp-
toms in the first letter. To enable them to do
this I append a few questions : —Do you experience
Giddiness, Weak Back, Palpitation of the Heart,
Flushes of Heat, Dryness of the Skin, Pale,
Sallow Complexion, Restlessness at Night, a
Despair of Recovery, Anxiety without Cause, Fear
of Death, Tendency to Suicide, Lack of Mental
Capacity, Sluggish Liver, Indigestion, Heavy Feel-
ing after Meals, Piles, Pains in the Chest, Cold
Shudders, Loss of Memory, Bad Taste in the
Mouth, Foul Breath, Coated Tongue, Hacking
Cough, Expectoration, Sleepiness during the Day,
Pains in the Back, Specks before the Eyes, Weak
or Bloodshot Eyes, Oozing of Yellow Saliva from
the Mouth during Sleep, Violent Temper, Loss of
Ambition, Lack of Development, Fits, or Short-
ness of Breath, Ringing Noises in the Head ?
Patients Should Send
ONE FOUND
with first letter, and describe all symptoms. This
Fee includes Medical Book, enclosed in linen
wrapper free from observation, also free from
Customs Duty to any Colony.
WHV SUFFER
Hidden anguish while the
FOLLOWING GUARANTEE
Is offered ? Dr. Burgoyne will, on receipt of
ONE POUND,
send his world-famed “Electric Girdle,” which is
guaranteed to cure even the most obstinate cases.
Many persons have wasted large amounts in vain
endeavours to rid themselves of irritability and
weakness, and, as a last resort, tried Dr. Bur-
goyne’s
“ ELECTRIC GIRDLE ”
with eminently satisfactory results. As a proof
of my confidence in the power of my Electric
Appliances, I am prepared to allow any honest
person to
TEST THEM FREE,
or wear them one month before payment, and
should they not do exactly what I claim, they
may be returned. The “Electric Girdle” has
been so widely lauded by the Medical Profession,
Press, and
Cured Patients,
that I feel no hesitancy in advertising it as a
Certain Cure for Debility from any cause arising.

ence and advice.

Legally Qualified and Registered by the Governing
Medical Board of New South Wales.
This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe.
He has devoted a Ufa- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may bo eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hii
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
DO YOU SUFFER
from headaches, drowsiness during the day, circles
round the eyes, giddiness, irregularity of the
bowels, specks before the eyes, bashfulness, dis-
contentedness, weakness or pain in the back, liver
or kidney complaints, buzzing in the ears and
head, pimples, a fear that something dreadful is
about to happen, weak stomach, yellow or blood-
shot eyes, constipation, impure blood, hasty,
uncontrollable temper, hacking cough, nervous-
ness in society, wakefulness, palpitation of the
heart, general weakness, a fear of insanity and

FREE, A LARGE
CLOTH BOUND BOOK,
showing plainly how all diseases, which result in
the above-named symptoms, may be cured with-
out unnecessary expense. This book will prove a
valuable companion, and even though you be per-
fectly well, its general information and prescrip-
tions may assist you in restoring some poor friend
to health, even though his case has been previously
pronounced incurable.
One Pound is Sufficient to Send
for remedies necessary to cure any ordinary com-
plaint. Should you require medical treatment, as
procrastination is sometimes dangerous, it would
be advisable for you to sit down quietly in your
chamber and write to the Doctor detailing all
experienced symptoms. He will, on receipt of
such a letter, write you promptly and courteously
a candid and straightforward opinion of your
case. If you do not think you understand your
case, send for his famous medical work, the price
of which is but 6d. ; enclosed in the volume
will be found a list of carefully-prepared questions
which will assist you materially in describing
your ailments. Dr. Richards uses nothing but
the purest remedies, and never prescribes injurious
drugs under any circumstances. Dr. Richards
has successfully treated nearly 30,000 cases since
coming to Australia, and has permission from, at
least, 15,000 persons to show their written evidence
of his success. All communications should bo

♦THE
NAMBROK ESTATE,
situated on the Latrobe River, Gippsland,
comprises 15,000 acres of very rich land,
which can scarcely be surpassed for agri-
cultural, fattening and dairy purposes. The
land is specially adapted for the growth of
maize, hops, root crops and cereals, and is
practically ready for the plough. The
Nambrok sheep and cattle have been for
many years noted for the excellence and
high prices obtained. The rainfall is abun-
dant, averaging about 30 inches per annum,
and the climate salubrious, being free from
extreme heat and cold. An unlimited
supply of water can be obtained at a mode-
rate depth, under 30 feet, in any portion of
the Estate.
The Thompson River, which is close to
the northern boundary of the pronerty, can
be easily and cheaply utilised for irrigation
purposes. The Rosedale Railway Station,
111 miles from Melbourne, is within 2J
miles of the property, and the railway line
runs directly through the property, and
the Heyfield station on the Maffra line is
about 5 miles distant.
THE
MELTON PARK ESTATE
comprises 7146 acres, close to Bacchus
Marsh, in the Parish of Yancardook,
County of Bourke, and is well known in
Victoria for its groat fertility and resi-
dential attractions. It is about a couple of
miles from the Melton Railway Station,
20 miles distant from Melbourne, where an
ever ready market exists for everything
the Estate produces.

Malted milk is made from the
richest and purest of milk, combined
with the nutritious and digestible
parts of wheat and malted barley.
Malted milk is not to be cooked,
no milk is to be added ; it is quickly
and readily prepared for instant use
by dissolving in water.
MALTED MILK is the best food for In-
fants. “ The composition of Malted
Milk resembles that of human milk.”
— Lancet. April 4, 1891.
MALTED MILK, as a food for In-
valids, surpasses all other light diets.
Being most nutritious and easily
assimilated, it is constantly pres-
cribed by the Medical Profession
in England and America. “ Very
palatable, and free from adulterants.'’
—British Medical Journal , April 18, 1891.

economically cured by the Cuticura
Remedies when the best physicians,
hospitals, and all other remedies fail.
No language can exaggerate the suf-
fering of those afflicted with these dis-
eases, especially of little babies, whose
tender skins are literally on fire.
CUTICURA
Remedies are the greatest skin
cures, blood purifiers, and humor reme-
dies of modern times, are absolutely
pure, and agreeable to the most sensi-
tive, and may be used on the youngest
infant and most delicate invalid with
gratifying and unfailing success.
Cuticura, the great skin cure, instantly allays
the most intense itching, burning, and inflamma-
tion, permits rest and sleep, heals raw and irri-
tated surfaces, cleanses the scalp of crusts and scales, and restores the hair. Cuticura
Soap, the only medicated toilet soap, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces.
Cuticura Resolvent, the new blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor reme-
dies, cleanses the blood of all impurities, and thus removes the cause. Hence, the
Cuticura Remedies cure every humor of the skin, scalp, and blood, with loss of hair.

Three to Go.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
He was rich. She was poor. The Third
Person was poor also, but handsome, while He
was decidedly otherwise. Consequently, Her
parents looked favourably upon Him, insomuch
that he married, and made substantial settlements
upon Her. The Third Person was left lamenting.
* * *
He proved a good husband, and their life
was happy, as lives_ go. The Third Person, how-
ever, was practical in his ideas, gave up lamenting,
and became a “ friend of the family.”
* « »
He went on drunks with the Third Per-
son, and in the course thereof met strange women.
She sued for divorce —infidelity—and got it;
evidence overwhelming.
* # #
Then her fall began. She married the
Third Person, and a year of sound thrashings on
his part, and collapse of bank-account on Hers,
showed her that marriage was a failure, if over-
done.
Moral : When you’ve got a good thing, stick
to it.

Sailing Song.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Yo ho ! for the breeze and the blueness,
Yo ho ! for the snow-plumed waves ;
For the waves and the fresh salt newness
Of the foam from the sea-maids’ caves.
Our hearts, to the happy laughter
Of the lilting ripples’ flow,
As lightly the wind’s wings waft her,
Keep chime, yo ho ! yo ho 1
Sing ho! for the headlands hoary !
Sing ho ! for the pillared spray !
They have fronted the morning’s glory
Since the dawn of Creation’s day.
O’er the unript rollers sweeping.
Where the free winds blare and blow,
Where the albatross sails sleeping,
We sailing sing, sing ho !
Sing low, for the daylight ended ;
Sing low, for the sun asleep;
For the shades, with the dead light blended,
In the bays where the night-tides creep.
On over the sweet sea-meadows,
Where the fair foam-roses glow,
Ghost-white, in the deepening shadows,
We lingering sing, sing low.
Sing soft, for the stars are dawning
And the fleeting shores grow dim,
And the song of the breeze-blown morning
Fades now to an evening hymn ;
For the wings of the night-winds eerie
Die down on the darkening foam,
And our boat, with her white wings weary,
Creeps back to her harbour home.

“ Thrift ” runs to fat. So does laziness !
“ Every ten years there is a fresh genera-
tion of needy knaves and greedy fools.”
The Wesleyan Church of N.S.W. have an
aggregate debt hanging over them of .£177,000.
The power of Israel hath not yet departed.
Sydney Sunday Times in a funny mood
slangs the three editors of the Law Chronicle for
their bad grammar. “Neither of the trio . . .”
runs one sentence in this outcry for purity of
English. Quis custodiet, &c.
When Primate Smith was at Windsor,
N.S.W., the other day, confirming the children in
St. Matthew’s, old identities wearied him with
stories of the early days of the historic building.
But all forgot to narrate how the convicts raised
the first foundation-stone and stole the coins de-
posited, and repeated the performance when the
stone was laid a second time.
Melb. Standard, whose greasy little
tongue is ever fondling the boots of the Victorian
Premier, writes: “Bluster and bounce do not
cause Mr. Patterson to cower. The Northumbrian
blood ill brooks defiance, and menace and threat
but arouse its fighting spirit.” J.B.P. had dis-
played his indomitable spirit by sitting on a
slightly truculent member of the wretched un-
employed. Pattetsonian valour is cheap.
It has been estimated that, for the 95,997
N.S.W. selections,- embracing 21,097,323 acres,
transferred from selectors to fresh owners during
’92, Government did hot get an average of ss. per
acre; while the “ selector ” got from the big pur-
chaser an average of 15s. per acre. Roundly,
Government had got out of dummies some
£5,000,000 for lands which the dummies trails
ferred to land-grabbers last year ; the dummies
were paid by the squatters <£ls,ooo,ooo—in any
case, a profit of whether it be called
“wages,” or “ increment on a bargain and, in
some cases, a clean bon.us in addition to the
moneys paid to the Government and which came
out of the pockets of the dummy-employing
squatters in the first instance. The game of
dummying and land-swallowing proceeds merrily.
During the ’BO drought a blackfellow
employed on a New England (N.S.W.) station
committed suicide, and another nigger was told
off to bury him in a hole to be made 6 feet deep.
Two hours later the latter returned to the boss,
fatigued with unusual toil. “ Well, Jackey, you
bury that feller yet ?” “ Baal me bury him, mas’r ;
diggum hole baal budgery ; woan three foot do um,
spose me ram um well?”
Jack and Dan were two mates at the Cape
River rush (N.Q.). After the camp had settled
down to close relations with the disturbed myalls,
the usual hideous physical results followed. Stal-
wart men were stricken witli insidious diseases;
lives that would have been marked “good” by
any insurance doctor took sudden death-blight.
Among these was Dan’s. Dan knew that he was
doomed A “bumhoat” visited the
camp, and Dan parted with all his “dust” Rr a
keg of rum and a phial of laudanum. Then he
invited a dozen or so of his mates to his “ wake.”
After shaking hands all round, he drank off the
laudanum, and—slept lie was buried
on the bank of a creek ; and not until he was well
and truly planted did the mourners recreate them-
selves with his liqui legacy.

What folly it would be to cut grass with a pair of scissors! Yet peo-
ple do equally silly things every day. Modern progress has grown up
from the hooked sickle to the swinging scythe and thence to the lawn
mower. So don’t use scissors!
But do you use SAPOLIO ? If you don’t you are as much behind the
age as if you cut grass with a dinner knife. Once there were no soaps.
Then one soap served all purposes. Now the sensible folks use one soap
in the toilet, another in the tub, one soap in the stables, and SAPOLIO
for all scouring and house-cleaning.

The Private-Banking Collapse.
A few weeks ago the Victorian banks
entered into a species of solemn league and
covenant whereby they pledged themselves
to make common cause against that common
enemy, the depositor, to support each other
liberally in times of stress, and generally to
make a stupendous effort to keep up the
price of shares ami to restore “confidence.”
The Victorian Treasurer also promised his
“cordial co-operation” in the good work.
Later on the banks of New South Wales
entered into a similar agreement. The sum
and substance of all this was simply that,
when the depositors of any particular institu-
tion wanted their money and the institution
hadn't got it handy, the other banks would
lend almost any amount on reasonable
security, and the State would assist in a
general fashion with no particular security
at all. When this resolute effort on the
part of the banks to hold each other up was
announced, it was unanimously agreed that
“confidence” had at last been restored.
And then, strangely enough, the finan-
cial institutions straightway proceeded to
crumble away—both the small ones which
were understood to be Hold up, and the big
ones which wore supposed to be holding
them up—faster than they had ever crumbled
before. The pyramid was hollow some-
where probably at the base. The weak
banks rested on the strong ones,
and the strong ones rested on public
confidence, and the public confidence
apparently rested on nothing in particular.
The league for mutual defence was only the
beginning of worse disaster. Before its
inception the Mercantile smash was the only
one, among what could reasonably be called
the legitimate banks of Australia, since the
beginning of the present depression. And
since the combin ition was built up the
Federal, the Commercial of Australia, the
E.S. ami A.C., and the Australian Joint
Stock Banks have gone under in quick
succession, with, apparently, at least two
more to follow at an early date.
* » »
The cause of it all is that shadowy and in-
definite thing described as “ want of confi-
dence.’’ In each case, the defunct establish-
ment had a largo amount of public money
on deposit, and whenever the depositors
wanted a little of it back the institution
shut up. Each of the deceased banks had,
to all intents and purposes, never paid back
one cent of the depositors’ money before in
tlitl whole Course of its existence, and it
doubled up like a wet rag at the first demand
for the return of even a fraction of the cash
intrusted to its cares In other words, the
amount of the deposits had always previously
maintained a steady increase, so that as one
old depositor withdrew he could always be
satisfied with the money of a new depositor
just arrived, and though the individual
creditor had always been paid, the bank
had never been really required to part
with anything. Then the public money
ceased to conla in with its former
rapidity, and whenever it became im-
possible to pay the old depositors with
the money of the ilow ones, tile collapse
eventuated; Of all the millions which (he
fallen institutions were alleged to possess,
hardly anything could be found just when it
was wanted. None of the four were bogus
institutions ; they were all legitimate banks,
conducted on what are alleged to be legiti-
mate principles ; yet when the strongest of
thorn was requested to meet about one-
tenth of the liabilities which it professed
itself by its balance-sheet—as able and
willing to liquidate at any moment, it in-
continently closed its doors.
* * #
From all of which there is only one possible
deduction : A solvent bank is an institution
which is able to meet its liabilities so long as
nobody desires that it should do so, and
which can’t meet them at any other time.
It is built on the principle that everybody
can have his money if he doesn’t want it,
and not otherwise. It lives upon “con-
fidence,” which is another name for bluff.
Also, its impudence is beyond measure and
unfathomable. In the case of every in-
solvent bank, the directors and the capita-
listic press have unanimously cursed the
depositor because his want of confidence has
brought about the disaster, and the fact that
.anybody is entitled to lack confidence in an
institution which cannot meet its liabilities is
altogether left out of the question. The man
who wants his own money back when it
becomes due is anathematised for so doing,
and at the same time is assured that the bank
would have been in a position to offer it to
him if he hadn’t wanted it and there was no
earthly chance of his taking it. The fact
that the Commercial and its companions in
misfortune would have been prospering to
this day, and might have kept on prospering
for generations, but for the want of public
faith, is, of course, beyond dispute ; the same
may bo said of the famous Australian Bank-
ing 00., and the Anglo-Australian, and the
Imperial, and Fink, and Nathan, and
Matthew Davies, and the Mercantile Bank,
and the Republic of Honduras, and Francis
Abigail, and Jimmy Munko, and banker
Richardson, of Sydney, and every other
bankrupt man or nation or institution.
So long as the public has faith
which means, so long as it keeps lending
more money in the shape of deposits or
otherwise, and never wants repayment —
anything would prosper. Even an institution
which owes a million, and doesn’t possess £5O
all told, will last, so long as the public has
“ confidence,” quite as well as the largest
and most solvent bank in this continent,
» # •
The recent disasters—particularly that of
the huge Commercial—raise a question which
w ill be difficult to answer. That institution
was large and tolerably solid, yet, w hen it
was called upon, nob very suddenly, to repay
only about 10 per cent, of its deposits it was
unequal to the strain. If it had been a
weaker bank it would have collapsed sooner
than it did. If it had been stronger it would
probably have stood the run until 15 or even
20 per cent, of its deposits were gone,"before
it reached bursting point. But evidently
every bank has a bursting point ; it is all a
matter of degree. And the problem which
no one is able to solve is this : What is the
point at which even the strongest of tile
Australian banks must collapse '( Under the
Australian system it is absolutely hopeless to
suppose that any bank could meet all the
claims of its depositors and noteholders, even
at reasonably long notice, but if it could be
proved that the strongest,of them could even
pay 25 per cent, of these liabilities in a day
of panic, it would make the public feel con-
siderably better. The Australian banking
system consists principally in taking huge
sums on deposit, at call or for any period
from three months up to, perhaps, three
yea s, and lending them out on securities
which, in many cases, cannot be realised for
ten years or more. This is the roost honest
aspect of our banking business, and it is built
entirely on the assumption that the public
won’t want its money back till the Greek
Kalends or thereabouts. If it does want it
it can’t have it. Therefore, the advantage
of a large bank over a small one is simply
that, in the case of the large hank, the public
is all the loss likely to want it. It is often
equally unable to get it in either case.
• * #
All men must die, and all things must
have an end, and every bank conducted on
these principles must smash sooner or later.
They all live on misplaced “confidence,”
and there always comes a time when the
nation at large is too frenzied to have confi-
dence in any private institution whatever.
A State Bank is the only one which can have
even a reasonable semblance of solidity, and
amid the crumbling of joint-stock financiers,
great and small, the necessity for such an in-
stitution grows every day more apparent;
The one enduring advantage of a States
Bank is that it cailnot, by any possibility, go
insolvent until the State itself goes insolvent;
it will not necessarily break even then, but
it cannot break till then. It is just within
the bounds of possibility that it may enter
on a riotous carder of mismanagement as
most private enterprises of its kind do at
some time or other, that it may make
advances on bad securities, and lose its
reserve fund ; but tvhile the State keeps
afloat it will remain as secure after
these disasters as before. It will bo
a part of the State, and behind it will
bo all the public resources, from the
unsold lands down to the dog-tax. It will
be practically proof against sudden rims.
It will have no “uncalled capital” which
call never bo obtained when it is wanted,
and which is a delusive security in good
times and a cause of ruin in bad, inasmuch
as the prospective liability drags down the
share quotations, and the fall in shares
scares the depositors, and the frenzy of the
depositors sends the shares down still lower,
and this increased fall puts the gilded
dome on the mania and makes the destruc-
tion final. Also, among its other advan-
tages, the creation of a National Bank will
make the note - issue a State monopoly,
whereby the country will obtain the use of
several millionpoundsas apsrpetualloan with-
out interest, and the currency, which has
hitherto consisted so largely of the unsecured
I O L T ’s of such men of straw as Matthew
Davies and Thomas Smith Richardson,
will be put on a safe footing. It will secure
for the Treasury a large annual income in
the shape of ordinary banking profits. And
it will make the country practically inde-
pendent of foreign loans and loan-mongers
for all time, which, in itself, is a sufficient
reason for its establishment,
• # *
And, on the other side of the question,
there are the two massive objections which
Treasurer See, of . New South Wales, lately
deposited with a great thud upon the pages
of Hansard : (1) That the State could not
obtain men competent to manage a National
Bank ; and (2) that there could be no finality
in the matter of paper money, and the Govern-
ment which issued notes to the value of one
million might as reasonably go on to issue to
the value of £50,000,000, till the country was
filled with depreciated currency, and State
notes were sold by the lb. To the first objec-
tion it may be answered that the State would
have a choice among all the private bankers
of Australia, and if there is no competent
man among them all, then private banking
is in such a bad way that it is high time it
was suppressed altogether. And, in the
second place, a bank, whoso notes are pay-
able in gold on demand, can only issue as
many as the nation will take, and if the
nation doesn’t want £50,000,000 worth, then
neither Treasurer See nor anybody else can
issue them, any more than he can issue the
moon.
Allaying the Panic.
Last week, in the unreasoning frenzy of its
commendable desire to save the lug hanks from
destruction, the New South Wales Government
drafted a bill to make bank-notes legal tender,
and as we go to press it is announced that this
weird sample of panic legislation is to be rushed
through all its legislative stages at one sitting,
and made law on the instant. New South
Wales is much given to this frantic kind of
law-making in times of terror, ns witness the
Treason Felony Act, and the Act to enable
cronk building societies to stave off their
depositors ; and in every instance it lias had
abundant cause to regret its unreasoning haste.
The purpose of the present measure is simply
to establish that unspeakable evil, the mere
possibility of which is declared to he an insur-
mountable obstacle to the establishment of a
State Bank—an inconvertible paper currency.
And not, let it be observed, an inconvertible
paper currency guaranteed by the State, such
as a National Bank, in the worst possible stage
of demoralisation, might possibly issue, but a
currency made by private speculators who
are admittedly unable to meet their engage-
ments, and whose guarantee, for the time at
least, is therefore of no earthly value. A bank
is a private speculation, run tor the sole benefit
of the owners, and if it cannot meet its credi-
tors it has no more right to compel them
to take its unsecured I O U’a without
interest, and payable at no lime in particular,
or not payable at all, than has the bankrupt
storekeeper, or the poor wretch who has a six-
penny feed in a restaurant and hasn’t the need-
ful coin among his rags to liquidate the bill, or
the suspended building society, or the insurance
company that is in difficulties, or the politician
who has filed his schedule. The hanks, un-
happily, arc under no State supervision in New
South Wales, and if they care to falsify their
returns the amount of paper they may issue is
practically unlimited. Also, there are ten or
twelve of them in the business, so that the
proposal virtually means that ten or twelve
different institutions will have power to adul-
terate the currency to almost any extent tlmv
feel inclined.
# • #
At present the amount of notes circulating
in New South Wales is about £1,500,000, or
less than one-third of the quantity which the
banks are authorised to issue ; there being no
demand for more, it is impossible, under
ordinary circumstances, to keep any more
in circulation. But, under Premier Dinns’s
newest inspiration, the banks can force some-
where bctwecen £4,000,000 and £10,000,000
more of their paper on the community
and have a great financial drunk on the
proceeds. When it becomes compulsory to
take notes as lawful payment for any and every
commodity it is Within the bounds of possibility
that New South Wales may yet Witness the
spectacle of an embarrassed bank sending a
barrow-load of its almost worthless paper to
the Treasury; and truculently demanding (; 0 -
vernment bonds in exchange, and then selling
the bonds for money to keep the tottering instn
tutioli afloat a little longer. Or the financial
institution which has gone aground may begin
to attend auction sales and buy up immense
quantities of valuable city lands, and pay for
them with its own “rag” money, and then
pawii them for gold in Melbourne or Adelaide
or London, and add the gold to its “ reserve
fund ” and make a great boom thereby. The
prospects opened up by Dibbs’s great idea— if
carried out to its legitimate conclusion—are
almost illimitable. So long as the inconvertible-
note scheme remains in force it is a (lead cer-
tainty that no bank will break in New South
Wales, but when gold payments are resumed—
as they must be some day—and the avalanche
of paper-money has to he redeemed once more,
half the surviving institutions will almost cer-
tainly go under in one act.
# # *
The semi-insolvent Queensland, Victorian,
British, or other outside bank doing business in
N.S.W. will now have a glorious chance to flood
that distressful country with its inconvertible
rag money, while it scoops the gold out of the
province, and sends it away to keep the totter-
ing concern afloat at headquarters. The whole
miserable scheme, as outlined in the daily
press, is mere counterfeit coinage on a huge
scale and under another name. If there is not
enough gold in the banks—and there apparently
is not—to meet the sudden demand, then an
issue of inconvertible paper may he indispens-
able for the time being. But the only states-
manlike device at such a crisis as the
present is to make the issue of paper
money a Government monopoly, and to
make liberal advances in Government notes to
such of the distressed banks as can offer reason-
able security for the same. The solvent bank
which is in trouble because its money is locked
up in good but mirealisable securities—securi-
ties which, perhaps, may not be conveniently
realisable for years to come, and on which no
other bank can afford to make advances—could
then pawn them with the Treasury, and
obtain a liberal loan in guaranteed State cur-
rency for a long term at a nominal rate of
interest or no interest at all. And as the notes
which would thus be put into circulation would
be secured by the State, the injury to the
public would be nil. The scheme now pro-
posed is not “ allaying the panic,” but merely
making it more violent. It is wholesale sus-
pension under another and a worse name. The
theory that a panic-stricken depositor can be
re-assured by legally authorising the hank to
refuse to pay him, or that a man will feel better
by being compelled to exchange his insecure
deposit-receipt, bearing interest and payable on
a fixed date, for another paper, equally insecure,
and bearing no interest, is not even honourable
insanity. It is more like plain bushranging
and highway robbery with violence.
PLAIN ENGLISH,
“Evening News” Economics.
Sydney E. News (in a leader wh'ch sounds li';c
the cry of a land-boomer in his overdraft agoi y)
attributes the prevailing depression to under-
valuations of property. This may be sound
reasoning enough for I lie dullard who sees no
difference between use and paper values, but
others will be inclined to think that the state-
ment requires to be reversed ere it can be
accepted. As a matter of unvarnished fact,
boom inflations of land and house-values have
assisted to bring about depression by crippling
industry. The rent-lord, the greediest of first
robbers, and a total abstainer from weahh-
crcating effort, has simply paralysed productive
effort by his over taxation of both Labour and
Capital. Now that prosperity has been thus
driven away and the bursting of the boom-
bubble has somewhat approximated values to a
common-sense basis, we are asked to believe
that prosperity has vanished because property-
values have gone down. The argument i»
sound enough for those who arc willing
to accept effect for cause. Here The Bulletin
will describe the true basis of national pro-
sperity for the better information of the News
and its silly correspondent, “Accountant,” who
writes to state the depression is to he banished
by a more general publication of such “coura-
geous and powerful” articles. It is beyond
contradiction that the prosperity of a com Ir/
does not lie in the bogus paper values given to
land or stocks. It is to he ganged only by the
sum of wealth it annually produces and the
nearness i-t attains to distributive equality. If
you placed a paper \a'uc ( f £100,0C0,0 )() to the
inch on every foot of land in Australia and did
not increase its j reduction, the country’s capa-
city for meeting its obligations would not be
advanced one penny-piece, and the benefit to
landlords even would be fleeting and illusory.
Editor Bulletin, —The circumstances attend-

admitted by the entire medical faculty that
leprosy is absolutely incurable. Whether it is
contagious or infectious, or both, is hardly yet
detcimincd owing to the lack of opportiuptiqp
for observation, and the fearful risks insepar-
able from practical investigation. At any bate,
however, it is pretty well agreed that infection
is probable where the excreta of the leper arc
subject to absorption by inhalation or imbibi-
tion by persons predisposed to disease of
the skin and mucous membranes. It is
therefore not enough that .Europeans should

Dear Bulletin, —What protection have thou-
sands of bush settlers and small farmers against
the cupidity, indifference, and arrogance of the
busli butcher who may live adjacent to a cattle-
station that always has some cancerous cattle ?
The bush butcher buys those at a nominal price,
avowedly “ to kill for the pigs ” ; but who, out-
side of his own circle, can trace their ultimate
destination ? And, indeed, in justice to the pig,
if not to the man who eats bacon, why should
this breach of health laws be lawful ? It is
done openly every day. I submit: Every can-
cerous beast should, in the first place, be
reported to the police and registered by the
owner, and, under penalties, be at once burnt.
The sale or purchase of a diseased beast should
be made a felony. How does this strike you?
Police sergeants are, I believe, supposed to
inspect all slaughter-houses and to take cognis-
ance of the operations of all licensed butchers
in their respective districts; but in sparsely-
populated areas the police cannot exercise
adequate supervision, nor do they attempt to
do so. The bush butcher furnishes his own
returns and brands to the police ; and is he an
utter fool that he should give himself away ?
Will some N.S.W. M.P. call for a return show-
ing the holders of butchers’- licenses and the
number of visits paid to each by slaughter-
house inspectors during ’9l and ’92? Meat is
the staple daily diet of bushmen, and cancerous
cattle are numerous almost everywhere. Causes
will produce,effects, and results may be guessed.
Diseased bullocks are sold ; that is certain.
What becomes of their beef ?—Yours, Bushman.
Ei iroa Bulletin, —Premier Dibbs’s refusal to
reduce the salaries of New South Wales
Supreme Court Judges on the ground, among
others, that those officers have accepted the
positions, believing at the time that they would
no'- be disturbed, gives the keynote of the
argument in favour of compensating publicans
for the local option or prohibition loss of their
licenses. A Judge accepts his position with the
understanding that he will be allowed to retain
it while of good character ; there is a formal
process for removing him if his character
becomes bad. Similarly, keeping to this point
of the subject alone, the publican considers,
when he builds a house to meet legal require-
ments and obtains a license, that he, too, will be
freefrom disturbance while his character remains
legally good. The parity disappears when it
is remembered that it was only a reduc-
tion in salaries, not a rejection from
office, that the Premier contemplated when
making his statement, but this makes the case
for compensation stronger as an argumentum ad
hominem. If it be inequitable to reduce a
Judge’s salary, it must be much more inequit-
able to deprive a publican of his livelihood. I
don’t say it is inequitable to reduce a Judge’s
salary, on the contrary, I say it is not; but I
impale those who reason thus with regard to
Judges on the horn of a dilemma of their own
fashioning. Dibbs’s opinion was accepted with-
out exciting any marked opposition by a House,
a majority of which had, a few nights before,
expunged the compensation clauses from the
Liquor Bill; and if these will argue the matter
out with themselves they will see they were
wrong in one case or in the other, and may
probably discover that they were wrong in
both, — Giraldus Cambrensis, jun.
The Australian publican does not take kindly
to the Sunday-closing law. He begins by
despising it, and wherever a moderately-safe
opportunity offers he breaks it. The average
constable also despises it, and only enforces it
when he has an ulterior motive to serve. A
metropolitan Sunday, with its back-entrance,
front-entrance, and sidc-cntrance infractions,
and the premeditated malice and barefaced
perjury which accompany most convictions,
are a miserable tribute to Sabbatarianism,
and an insulting reproach to common sense.
When arc N.S.W. Inspector-General Fosbury's
views, as officially reported to Mr. Parkes when
last Colonial Secretary, to bear fruit? Mr.
Fosbery spoke then in the interests of the
police as much as in those of the public, and in
condemning total closure on Sundays, pro-
phesied that the police would, in endeavouring
to enforce an impracticable law, be led into
crooked ways. In a Sydney court, last week,
it was made known to the Bench that the police
are in the habit of counting and keeping tally
of the number of strangers who pass in and
out of hotels on Sundays. Use is made of this
tally when next the publican applies for his
license, and thus, without any chance of justi-
fying himself or explaining his position, that
tradesman may be deprived of his means of
living. The visitors to bis hotel may not have
necessarily been in search of drink. But,
whether or not, their confessed practice places
the police in the worst class of spies. They
treasure up incidents which may be harmless,
and, after an interval, longer or shorter as the
case may be, present them as an accusation of
guilt when it is impossible for the victim to
satisfactorily explain them.

Premier MMlwraith simply blinds people
with cayenne pepper in reiteratively crying
that, up to date, not a single proposition to
construct a land-grab railway has been placed
before Queensland Government. Who expected
that one would have been —yet? The land-
pouncing syndicator isn’t a fool—quite. Since
the Q. Parliament approved of 11 possible (yea,
absolutely certain, if legislatively approved)
laud-grant - railways, the Gxu pell wraith that
then reigned has been dissolving and has dis-
solved ; and the substituted MTlwraith has
not yet seated himself for good in the saddle of
dictatorship. The Parliament itself has died
of a very bad old age. The 11 land-grab
approvals have to be ratified by the next
Parliament, and then— then comes the proper
time of the waiting syndicator. It is, however,
a certainty that the land-grab-railway syndi-
cates have got their schemes already formu-
lated, and it is highly probable that the man
MTlwraith knows it, though the Premier
MTlwraith is utterly ignorant thereof. No
syndicate is idiotic enough to show its greedy,
grasping hand before the Queensland elections !
Au act of stupidity like that would spoil every-
thing. The footpad who lies in ambush for the
belated home-goer does not usually give his
intended prey notice of the exact locality where
he means to garrote him ; else, the garrotting
would never come off. So with the land grab
syndicates. It is their policy to lie low now,
and to appear to be non-existent, hut, once
place MTlwraith on a dictator’s throne, and
you will see their gun-barrels glittering through
the hedge.

Henry Gyles Turner, as a witness for the
Crown against the Melb. Mercantile Bankers,
was nob taken seriously. He very soon resolved
himself into a supporter of balance-sheet jug-
glery, and his “ re-examination ” by Finlayson
became practically a severe cross-examination.
One clause in the Crown indictment of Matthew
Davies and Co. charges them with borrowing
£IOO,OOO from the Commercial Bank, just prior
to the issue of their last balance-sheet, for the
purpose of unduly inflating the “ coin reserve,”
and with including this important sum amongst
ordinary “deposits,” instead of amongst money
due to other banks. The £IOO,OOO was supplied
by the Commercial in the names of George
Coppin and Gyles Turner — i.e., it was a bogus
advance “deposit,” or whatever they might
choose to call it, by Coppin and Turner, and
the Commercial Bank took a £IOO,OOO cheque
from the Mercantile as security for it. Some
of Turner’s evidence on this unwholesome
transaction is highly calculated to restore public
confidence in Australian banking. The Crown
cross-examines Turner :
Q.-It was a debt due to Coppin and yourself ?
A.—Yes. It was not a debt due by the Mercantile
Bank to other banks.
Q. —Why, then, was the cheque given for £IOO,OOO.
A.—There w’as no other means of debiting the account.
Q.—Why should the cheque be given to the bank, and
not to Coppin and Turner ?
A.-—Because Coppin and Turner were responsible to the
Commercial Bank.
Q. Was there a farthing of Coppin and Turner’s in it?
A.—No; it was borrowed from the Commercial by
them.
Q— And I need not ask you whether you think it a fair
and honest statement to make that the debt was not due
to the Commercial, but to Coppin and Turner?
A.— Technically that is quite correct.
Q. —Why, on the 19th February, should the Mercantile
give a cheque to the Commercial for a debt due to Coppin
and Turner, if it was due to them ?
A. —I cannot tell you that,
Q.—But you are an experienced banker, Mr. Turner ;
what is the meaning of it if the transaction was honest
and abovehoard ?
Mr. Gyles Turner couldn’t say what the exact
meaning of it might be, but he considered that
everything was technically correct. The most
staggering example of Mr. Gyles Turner’s
“broad” views on balance-sheets had been given
a little earlier in the cross-examination :
Q. —At the meeting, Sir Matthew said that “ the
deposits showed an increase daring the half-year, and
now stood at £1,831,000, as against £1,784,000, so that
there had been a satisfactory increase." Was it correct
for Sir Matthew to include your £IOO,OOO in the deposits
and to say that ?
Several of the defending counsel tried to stop
this question, but the Bench allowed it. And
then Mr. Gyles Turner, pressed again to say
whether the £IOO,OOO was “a satisfactory
increase in the deposits,” replied “Fes.” The
Crown remarked that “Yes” was not the
answer that had been “expected from Mr.
Turner.” And The Bulletin ventures to
believe that the Crown’s surprise will be shared
by everybody outside banking circles—and by
a good many inside them.

One day last week New South Wales Ministe r
Lyne informed a deputation that he was per*
sonally in favour of the construction of the
Goulburn-Crookwell railway by “private enter-
prise,” and promised to lay the matter before
Ids colleagues. Minister Lyne is the same
massive, dreary man who has so long pervaded
the length and breadth of the land, softly
urging the sale of the State railways and tram-
ways to foreign syndicates, and the fact that he
approves of “private enterprise” may there-
fore be taken as read. At the same time, he
would do well to explain why he chooses this
time above all others for his agitation. At the
present moment he and his colleagues have before
the House a bill providing that all lands re-
quired for railway construction shall be obtained
on the “ betterment ” principle. This will very
materially reduce the cost of railway construc-
tion and make it possible to build many other-
wise impossible new lines at a handsome profit.
And a good many people would like to know
why Mr. Lyne is so anxious to deprive the
State of the benefits accruing from this new
system. Also, why he never worried about the
necessity of selling the railways, and began
calling them a “ burden,” until they began to
be profitable. Minister Lyne is a dreadfully
inopportune personage.

There are about a thousand willing men
unemployed in Adelaide, the capital of an
Australian province that exports a surplus from
its last harvest of 180,000 tons of wheat (points
out Cornelius Proud, ex-pressman, and now
that rara avis, “a Christian stockbroker,” of
Adelaide). Landowners have paid the S.A-
Governments about £10,000,000 ; the Govern-
ments have spent £20,000,000 in public works,
the bulk of which expenditure has gone to
improve private properties ; that and the influx
of population have made those private pro-
perties worth £32,000,000; the land-tax on
these —Jd. in the £ —is under £67,000, while
Customs taxes, paid mostly by landless men,
are made to yield £700,000 a year. Proud
argues that an increased land-tax and remission
of Customs would—(1) save 44,000 larfdless
men about 255. or 30s. a year apiece—“a free
breakfast-table (2) make 26,000 poorer land-
holders pay only 3s. 9d. each more per year in
land-tax, while they would also save 255. or
30s. a year in Customs dues; (3) compel eight
absentees to pay more land-tax than all these
/0,000 men pul together, or, reckoning their
families, say, more than 250,000 of the popu-
lation of S.A. Premier Downer has urged
that an increased land-tax would press unduly
on the already overburdened farmer, and the
National Defence League {alias Ass) lustily
echoes Downer’s sentiments. Proud has looked
up the figures for the Hundred of Barossa
(Downer’s electorate) and ffiuhj its total land-
values to be £323,000 —“ which is less- than is
owned individually by some of the wealthiest
of the many National Defence Leaguers !” Ten
men—city men, or heads of “ country families”
in S.A.—own each from £200,000 to £500,000
worth of land-values.
Pastor W. G. Taylor is being sent by New
South Wales Conference on a despoiling tour to
Britain, Canada and the U.S.A., with candidly
stated instructions to cadge in each country
until each is cleaned out of its “ foolish money
up to a minimum expectation of £IO,OOO. Then
Mr. Taylor is to take Maoriland on his return
journey, and lighten it also of all its spare coin.
And all this is in reduction of the debt in-
curred by Sydney Methodism in connection
with the Centenary Hall 1 It is easy to be
pious with other people’s money. Here is Rev.
G. Lane’s view of this expedition to compel
foreigners to pay for Sydney’s stuccoed zeal: —
It would be a disgrace to the N.S.W. Methodist Church
if it allowed this magnificent building to pass out of its
hands. Why, that site seemed to he sacred ground !
So sacred that the native liberality of its
idolaters is not squeezable enough to pay (he
cost of its boom value, which is to be made up
by levies upon foreigners. Pastor Taylor is
expected to “ glorify God ” by, snicking £IO,OOO
from Christians abroad to feed the pride of
Sydney Methodism ! The average formalist
always wants strangers to pay his debts to the
Deity.
S.A. Elections
All the S. A. nominations took place on Saturday,
April 8 ; but as some districts are too extensive to
enable the ballot papers to be circulated within a
week, only 23 elections' out of 27 for the Assembly
were decided on Saturday, April 15, each consti-
tuency returning two members. Nearly all the
members who ratted against the Coekburn Govern-
ment on the progressive land-tax in 1890 were left
in the lurch, while some of the others had very
narrow escapes. Ten politicians who sat in the
last Assembly were defeated, among them being
William Benjamin Rounsevell, wine merchant
and bank director, who had sat continuously since
February, 1875, and who, at the time of his
catastrophe, was Treasurer of the province. His
characteristics are belly, beard, and a surprising
aptitude to adapt himself to the exigencies of the
political situation, so that he has had a v ery good
share of office. Two ordeals had to be under-
gone within a very brief time, for he was—
and still is—a director of the Commercial Bank.
Laurence Grayson, engineer and temperance hotel-
keeper, who has sat in the House since April, 1887,
was another victim. Hebeganlife as aLabourrepre-
sentative, but the temptation of office and ,£lOOO
a year was too great, and he made the fatal
blunder of joining the Downer Government as
Commissioner of Public Works after the Holder
Cabinet were intrigued out of office late last
session. The Bulletin long ago prophesied that
the constituencies only wanted a fair chance in
order to squelch these two Ministers, in whose
place Downer will do his utmost to entrap Cock-
burn and Holder. They will, however, decline.
Lewis Cohen is a Jew, a money-lender, and a
Radical, who has been Mayor of Adelaide, and
who has twice declined Ministerial office as less
profitable than the loan and discount business.
He came to the Assembly at the head of the poll
in 1887 for North Adelaide, wiping out a Uni-
versity professor who was an aggressive Free-
trader. He got a similar position in 1890, and
would have crept in again this time had not
Hawker poured out money like water, or if the
friends of Labour-candidate Wood had not
plumped. Cohen is chiefly famous for his lungs,
his affability, bis white waistcoat, and the rate of
his interest. He goes strongly for a progressive
land-tax, but opposes any impost which threatens
to take any of the gilt off the three golden
balls. George Feltham Hopkins, in 1887, was sent
in to Parliament by the lumpers of Port Adelaide,
but of late sessions an uneasy suspicion has been
felt that the National Ass had claimed him for its
own, and a while ago, in a fit of political delirium
tremens, he publicly renounced and reviled Trades-
unionism. Two Labour members now fill the
seats occupied last Parliament by him and Trea-
surer Rounsevell. Theodore Hack is a Wesleyan
local preacher with ambition to shine in public
affairs. His anxiety for office, however, caused
him to over-reach himself and disaster has re-
sulted, for while he offended one side he did not
manage to placate the other. He has sat in Par-
liament for three years, but has small chance of
ever getting there again. It was in his consti-
tuency that Medway Day, of the Voice, came to
grief after leading comfortably in the first boxes.
Henry Lamshed, who, after three years’ service,
has fallen into the depths, is the author of the his-
toric saying, “Now Henry Lamshed has come
into the House there will be no more tidd ley-
winking.” He has been christened “The Voice
of the Country ” because he once sent a telegram
to the Premier beginning—“ The voice of the
country demands.” He, too, is a Wesleyan local
preacher who has not tiad a peculiarly straight
career in Parliament. J ohn Miller,once Pi esidentof
the Farmers’ Association, “ratted ” over the Pro-
gressive Land Pax as did Benjamin Gould, grand
high panjandrum of Rechabites and Druids. Both
have met their reward. Robert Kelly helped to
create the National Ass, and his last wail at the
returning of thanks (for defeat) was full of curses
on the obnoxious animal. J. J. Osman, whip to
the Holder Government, fell under especially
tragic circumstances. In the first ballot lie was
two behind the second man. Then votes were
found in a Legislative Council box, which made'
both equal. Finally, a second scrutiny put his
opponent five ahead, and there are threats of a
petition. Osman is a saddler, with Radical lean-
ings, but a refusal, when Commissioner of Lands,
to resume a big squatter’s holding lost him a lot of
votes.

average Irish Protestant in Ireland permits his parsonhood
to lead him also by the nose. The downfall of the late
Parnell, the man who might have delivered Ire-

My Dear Moorabinda—•
The farewell ball given by the captain and
officers of H.M.S. Orlando and Mildura was a
largely-attended success. It took place in the
sail-loft on Garden Island, which had been cleverly
transformed into a flag-and-palm-haunted ball-
room with a very fast floor. The quaintest deco-
rative novelty was the diving-suit with a light in
its head, holding programmes at the top of the steep
stairs. The sybaritish supper tables were sou’fully
gotten up with autumn-leaves, pink and white
cosmea and sunflowers, and myriads of coloured
lights overhead helped to perfect a most festive
ensemble. Altogether, the framing of the Squad-
ron Ball was very well done, and if the extremely
low divans round the walls made the sitters
thereon reminiscent of “ honeypots all in a row,”
they were the only drawback.
The naval officer moults many of his fine
feathers when Fate casts him into a land without
a real Governor. The absence of epaulettes at the
Squadron ball subtracted much glitter from the
mise-en-scene and gave the dresses a better chance
than is usual in uniformed circles. There was
no distinctly-best dressed woman, unless it was
somebody in white satin brocaded in silver and
softened with white tulle round the corsage, where
nestled a big bunch of violets. The Admiral’s
wife, Mrs. Bowden Smith, wore yellow brocade
and snappy diamonds and a piece of lace around
her throat; Miss Bowden Smith sported ivory
Bengaline trimmed with yellow ; Mrs. (Mayoress)
Manning wore shades of grey brocade and dia-
monds; Miss Manning was in pale yellow and
mauve ; and her sister, a debutante, in an Empire
gown of white Bengaline and shower-posy of
white roses, looked very ingenuous.
Mrs. Mailler-Kendall came in ivory silk with
the fashionable shoulder-puffs of yellow velvet
and an - -immense posy of golden ’santhemums.
Miss Cox wore black trimmed with yellow ribbons
and jet; and her sister, in pale yellow, was
scarcely festive enough for the occasion. Miss
Williamson and her sister were very chipper in
white silk, trimmed in an effective way with
strawberry velvet. Miss M'Donagh sported pale
sea-green Bengaline, trimmed with dark crimson
velvet and real lace—diamond ornaments. Mrs.
W. Mitchell, in an electric-blue silk made with
cream lappels, wore a glittering necklace of
diamonds—indeed most of the women turned out
effectively. Awful exceptions were an auburn-
haired belle, who had enhanced her exceeding
rufousness to conflagration point by bright-green
velvet sleeves. The warning chromatic lesson
taught by the commingling of colour on a parra-
keet had been wasted on her. Also, a damsel in
pea-green made in panels over a white skirt might
have posed as Home Rule; and I didn’t like a lady
in sage-green and butter-yellow, who grasped a
ragged handful of sunflowers as if she had once
been photographed like that. But the most start-
ling frock on deck was a rainbow dress in every
colour of the prism. However, it was apt enough
for a showery evening.
The Squadron Ball was pre-eminent in flirta-
tion. Whoever evolved the sitting-out corners
must have been a past master in the art; the little
nooks and crannies looked like the work of a man
who knew the utter hollowness of staircase phil-
anderings where the too impetuous swain is liable
to go bumping down a whole flight if he isn’t very
wary. But even dusky nooks did not altogether
suffice (it was a good-bye dance), for people who
left per early boat were interested in seeing be-
neath the side-flap of an awning far from electric-
lights, about two feet of fleecy white skirt and in
very close proximity a dark-blue pantaloon with a
broad gold stripe down it. That was all—but
you can’t think how eloquent a testimony it was
to the real necessity of the Australian Squadron.
It is whispered that a certain acting vice-royalty
is more touchy than any real Governor ever dares
to be. A boat which was to convey him and his
following to a recent festivity was found to con-
tain a handful of society people who had also been
invited, whereupon the A.G. turned restive and
refused to go at all except in solitary grandeur.
Another boat was requisitioned, and their acting
excellencies took a huffy run across an<j back, and
wouldn’t “break bread” because of the ruffled
state of their feelings. Ni b their own feelings, you
know ; only their acting-vice-regal feelings.
Mr. Lane’s “New Australians” (they have a
inarching song, en parenthbsc, in breathless quaver
and semi-quaver time—very national, as only a
wallaby could walk to it) ought to be given pause
in their hegira by Mr. Larmour’s observations re
Paraguay— i.e., if the original notion of every Jack
having his own Jill is still to be adhered to.
“New Australia” is a land of rich women with few
male relativ es (the males have nearly all been killed
in battle), and as the New Australian man won’t
change his nature with his sky, he will probably
pursue the jich girl in the good, old Australian
way. And he may even fall a victim, in the
fickle, old Australian style, to the “ different little
manners ” of centless Paraguayan belledom, and
so leave lamenting ladies specially imported on
his behalf.
However, another aspect of the matter is that
the young Australian women—the hay-coloured
Hobartians, the pallid, long-backed Cornstalks,
and so on—will seem as angels ever bright and
fair to the rich “estancieros,” so that honours
should be easy. It will be hard for the genuine
Nevy Australian man to be sure of the New Aus-
tralian woman while the dark and rolling eye of the
courtly Paraguayan squatter glitters longingly
beneath his sombrero. You cannot reckon with-
out human nature even in Paraguay, and the net
result may be that Mr. Lane and a few of his
toughest, most married and most prosaic and
sincere disciples will survive, while a sirocco of
matrimony frorn an unexpected quarter scatters
the flower of their following to the four winds of
Heaven.
“ Carmen,” at Sydney Lyceum, last Saturday,
was the gayest-looking opera of them all. No-
body wore the same clothing any longer than the
one act—even the chorus participating in the fre-
quency of spick-and-span raiment. Miss Monta-
gue’s Carmen was takingly frocked, although her
face and arms were scarcely olive enough. Her
most becoming frills were the first dress of black-
bugled silk, wide, deep hem and bodice-trimming
of glittering patch-work, black mantilla with a
coquettish red rose; and her last dress of yellow
silk spangled in gold and daringly but triumph-
antly trimmed with blue velvet; Spanish jacket
and hanging sleeves, cream lace mantilla, and any
amount of silver and gold fringes. Mr. Parley,
as the Toreador, was next in glory in black velvet,
silver lace_ and touches of scarlet; and anon in
scarlet satin trimmed with gold lace.
Apropos , the “Carmen” chorus were very
skittish on the first night, and one young lady, in
very short skirts of pale-pink net and Hessian
boots, smoked a cigarette and kicked up her heels
as if she thought the show was a burlesque on
itself.
“Hamlet” was staged at Sydney Royal one
evening last week. Miss Lily Dampier, as
Ophelia, in pink nun’s veiling and a bucolic blush,
played the forsaken damsel as if walking in her
sleep. _ Also, if Miss Lily would occasionally
speak in a voice that one might reasonably suppose
she ate her dinner with, there are people who
would rush to applaud the fact, Hamlet is a very
loquacious prince, and after sitting out Shake-
speare's champion monologuist I came to the con-
clusion that it wasn’t Hamlet that was mad—it
must have been his relatives. There was a good
circle headed by Mayor and Mayoress Manning-
in pink silk and chiffon.
The most actively-discussed individual up North
just now is a bristly-whiskered foreigner, who
lays claim to owning hundreds of serfs in his own
country, but who certainly looks exceedingly like
an adventurer in this, and Society is literally
dying to know whether he is a baron or a barber.
One fussy old lady, who encourages him tremen-
dously, wrote to somebody in his native wilderness
to find out whether his linen bore his real initials
and all that sort of thing, ere she began to vouch
for him—and a highly satisfactory reply was
received, according to one version.
The other account of this mysterious stranger is
much less pleasing. At the same time, well-
authenticated stories float about of the richness of
his way of living : gold-mounted dressing-cases,
golden-headed umbrellas, golden keys to all his
trunks, gold frames round gems of pictures. And
there are true tales of festive feasts at his hotel,
where the wines are a revelation. Whatever
he turns out to be—genuine noble, plain Govern-
ment spy, or gaudy adventurer—he is a pictur-
esque, Monte Christo sort of mystery, and Society
—more especially the male portion thereof—revels
in his hospitality, and wouldn’t be at all surprised
to learn either that he was Somebody, or Some-
body’s valet masquerading for theatrical villainy.
Any kind of mysterious stranger is a welcome
excitement in a limited society, where everybody
knows the family history of everybody else.
At the Fresh Air League ball on May 31st all
the committee-ladies’ rosettes will be made of the
Duff tartan, and all the committee-men’s badges
of the same howling and shrieking combination.
The Duff tartan, which has at last been run to
earth, is more like an explosion in a dye-works
than any reasonable chromatic mixture. It is a
blaring mingling of red, blue, green, and yellow,
with a preponderance of red, and only the most
self-sacrificing loyalist will do anything more than
line herself with it. By the way, is it in anticipa-
tion of the arrival of Mr. Duff that masculine
society is doing the Block in tartan neckties?
In “ A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” at Her
Majesty’s, perhaps the airiest figure was the
Titania of Hilda Spong, attired in a robe of white
gossamer—more opaque than the robing of Madge
Seymour in the part, but still very ethereal. Miss
Watts Phillips, as Oberon, carried the martial
mail, plumes, and silken cloak dashingly, and
Lilia Wilde (Helen) wore a vieux-rose robe most
poetically draped. Miss Wilde, I see, has culti-
vated a fatal habit of hitching her garments in
moments of excitement that will gain her a
nautical nick-name if she isn’t careful. Fetch-
ing Miss Halkett (Hermia), in white faintlv
mingled with blue, helped the scenery con-
siderably, if only by occasionally casting her
profile against it. Albert Norman (Lysan-
der) was the dandy man of the sparkling
classic, in a white and silver tunic and blue and
silver cloak. Mr. Norman shapes well in Shake-
speare every way you look at him, but why will
he pull such a cry-baby tace when stage grief
marks him for her own ? Things I couldn’t make
out were the sailor-like hats that two he-lovers—
in skirtlets a ballet lady would jib at, and long
trunks had slang at their backs. Only imagine
such a get-up topped by a Torn Tug hat! The
Dream was full of colour, and if the heavy
blush on the Harvest ballet made it look as if it
might turn into a nightmare, it was the only fear
in a brilliant and scintillating show.
Madame Emily Soldene, I hear, is doing musical
criticisms for Sydney Evening News.
The Australian Home Readers—or a branch of
them—held a re-union at Sydney University, last
Saturday, and a variety of things kept "a fair
number of guests on the qui vive from three to
five. The most taking dress of a not very dressy
occasion was a coarse black serge with sleeves, and
so on, of fawn cloth and edgings of beaver fur—
flat deep collar embroidered in silver—but, then,
the wearer was a pretty girl.
Viewing the approaching N.S.W. vice-regalities
with a prophetic eye, I feel inclined to lay genteel
odds that the Duffs won’t be wildly popular. I
say wildly, for, mark you, I think they will be
greatly liked. I see that Mrs. D. calls her
husband “Robert”; that artful showman, Gov.
Oanngton, who so adroitly played to the gallery,
was “Bob.” It seems to me that between
. -Robert ’ and “Bob” a great gulf of popularity
is fixed. Besides which, the lady is a branch of
the tree which grew Lord Precedence Scott, who
wanted the naval station removed from Sydney
because he ate his'dinner once on the wrong side
of the Governor. Also, Lady D. does not enjov
robust health and is more addicted to “ thought-
ful, womanly work than social gaiety.” On paper,
Lady D. seems just about the last woman to fill a
long-felt want in a land where the barn-dance
rears its hydra-head, and the gilded youth salute
one another, even at Government House, with,
“Hulloa, old Catfish !”
I see that the incoming N.S.W. Governor has
appointed a Mr. John Baird (related to Lily
Langtry’s, friend) as his honorary aide-de-camp.
His Excellency is beginning caunily. A profes-
sional aide-de-camp’s screw adds up to .£6OO a
year, all told—but the honorary article gives his
services in return for board and residence and
change of air and the chance of picking up a
nugget in George-street. Lord Bertie—who is
connected with us by marriage—was an honorary
aide-de-camp. So was Chumley. For the young
man who has a penchant for heiresses and wishes
to dispose of himself to the best advantage, there
are many colder posts than honorary satellite to
the Guvnah.
1° bis speech at the farewell banquet in London
Governor Duff remarked that he was aware he
was going out to Sydney under social disadvan-
tages as compared with Lord Jersey and Lord
Carington (who, it is announced, has been coach-
ing him up). The first mistaken impulse, this, of
an undisciplined Governor ! On the strength of
so / self-cheapening an admission, it’s ten to one his
wife will be mobbed by gushing dames anxious to
assure her that they think her positively charm-
ing, and if she escapes after that without having
made half-a-dozen “ sisters ” in one interview, it
will be simply a piece of Chinaman’s luck. Imagine
a Governor who allows that he’s a social disadvant-
age ! Why, I can positively see the patronising
hand-grabs of the reception committee who really
mean to let it be seen, for the encouragement of
Governor Duff and the public, that they’re as
jovial and cordial as possible.
In a letter to a Sydney daily, the writer men-
tions that the happy Australian working woman
gets only twopence-halfpenny for making a blouse,
and that only the smartest workers make Is. 3d.
per diem! But, after all, the blame doesn’t
entirely rest where the people want to put it—on
tlmemployer who pays such microscopic wages—
it rests with the woman who spends her life in
fossicking out the cheapest jack in town and
encouraging him by her patronage to sell his
wares at the lowest possible rates, and then
leaving him to plan new cutting-down operations,
because there is a more deeply dyed “ sweater ” in
the next street. And the haggard seamstress
bears the brunt of the whole thing, because it is
certain that the shopkeeper will see that he doesn’t
suffer from the haggling spirit of the age. And
there you have it.
Woman (who is always prevented from bril-
liantly distinguishing herself by an “ if ’’—voting
is the “ if ” just now) has it in her own hands to a
great extent to keep the sewing-rate up. She can
improve matters by not hanging around “start-
ling reductions ” like a fly near a honey-pot, and
by never flattening her nose on windows full of
underclothing “going at a sacrifice’’—for the
girls who made it are the sacrifice, poor things ! I
really think that if women were ready to give a
fair price for made articles—and also if the handi-
work of the ladies in durance-vile were sold at,
and not below, market-rates, things might im
prove for the sempstress. But perhaps it’s a false
notion. “The Song of the Shirt ” was written for
all time.
A Southern cheap drapery firm has aroused
some _ consternation among its employes by
insisting that its saleswomen shall wear white
collars and cuffs as a distinguishing badge of the
establishment. This is probably the least expen-
sive way of keeping the shop permanently in the
public eye that the world has ever seen, and the
saleswomen should square matters by charging
their inventive employers advertising rates out of
work hours—two shillings per inch, or according
to the depth of linen the individual sports in her
private capacity. The shop has already achieved
a nickname on account of tne collars and cuffs.
I have recently received two musical composi-
tions valse brilliante, by Mons.
Rene Desjardins, and “Lilian’s Dance,” by Q.
de Cairos Rego. “ S&nillante ”is Mons. Desjar-
dins’ maiden effort, so one may expect his next
attempt will bo more rhythmic and tuneful; for
the waltz is not altogether bad and has a rather
effective introduction. “ Lilian’s Dance ”is the
fourth essay of the composer with the romantic
name, and, although it is not ro musicianly as his
“ Impromptu,” it is still far above the ru-tum-
tiddy-tum style of music.
Yours faithfully.

Another gipsy—“ Carmen ”--went up a t
Sydney Lyceum last Saturday. Miss Annis
Montague’s Carmen was a brazen hussy who sang
her mocking music with ease and brilliancy, and
fell like a feather in the death scene. Loti Jose
isn’t a pet part with Charles Turner, who got
through it with a wise appreciation of how much
to leave undone in what is practically a one-
woman opera. Mr. Farley’s Escamilla was a
gorgeous vision in reasonable voice, but his attack
in the famous Toreador song was spiritless, as if
he had seen the great paste-board bull in the
wings. Miss Florrie Young’s “Michaela” \ vas
well received, and her best solo, “ Here in this
Wild Place Alone,” was thoughtfully and sweetly
sung. Miss Young's warbling, however, points
the moral that comic opera is a good servant but a
bad master. Miss Cicely Staunton, Miss Lita
Fred. Wentworth, Rosevear and Edward Ure, in’
the other parts, made as much splash as they
could in the chorus-y opera. “Lucrezia Borgia”
ends the opera season.
* ¥ *
“ Midsummer Night's Dream,” at Sydney
Majesty’s, deserves to bring in many shekels to
the treasury, if only for the brilliant acting 0 f
George Rignold as the gentleman with the long
ears and the mule’s cranium. The part of
N. Bottom suits Mr. Rignold to perfection, and
it is a ghastly and solemn thing to think that a
man who can do such comedy should have so long
wasted himself on the chronic hero of Sims and
Pettitt’s drama—the individual who quarrels with
his rich father through marrying a maid of low
degree, and goes away to London where he comes
to grief and a bale falls on him in the clocks, so
that he has to be taken to tiie hospital, while his
wife is abducted by the back hair to a lunatic
asylum by the wicked cousin who murdered the
old man after George had gone, and laid the
blame on George, and stole the will which
is hidden up a tree where it is found
hy the ancient, heavy individual whose daughter
was seduced by the cousin, and who now
sings in the snow with her hair down and a frozen
infant in her arms, in consequence of which all the
characters seize each other furiously by the throat
and George comes into the property. Nicholas
Bottom is a very different character from that
chivalrous bore of old. Mr. Rignold revels in the
peculiar, dunderheaded humour of the Athenian
weaver, and he is one of the few actors who can
put profound expression into the ass’s countenance
and show the varying emotions of a mule in
moments of excitement. Doubt, suspicion, joy,
and vanity are written large on the muzzle of the
animal, and his ears are a compressed narrative
in three volumes. Also, Mr. R.’s tendency
to embonpoint suits the part ; the aggressive
bull-voiced clown is always a man of girtli and
circumference somehow ; nobody ever saw a small
thin man in such a character. Mr. Augustus
Glover, with a marked tendency to needless
bellowing, performs as the Athenian duke. That
dainty maiden, Miss Hilda Spong, is a winsome
Titania, and Misses Lilia Wilde and Rhoda
Halkett do Helena and Hermia- the latter in
particular leaving behind her an impression that
the audience would like to rise up, individually
and collectively, and marry her on the spot.
Demetrius and Lysander, even after the closest
examination, don’t show any visible cause or
reason for the interest which these two ladies take
in them, and when Helena sprints madly after
Demetrius it is faintly reminiscent of a time when
the present writer saw a good-looking quadroon
girl racing after a cart of condemned nsh. Miss
Ethel Buckley, who figures as Puck, is a little
lady of marked promise, and The Bulletin also
wishes to speak a kindly word for the lady in pink
tights who fell head first down the stair, and the
black warrior who somehow got his leg fixed in a
crack of the staircase. The piece is mounted in a
fashion which would gladden the very liver of the
departed author, and the obtrusively public-house
aspect of one or two of the “elves” is hardly
worth complaining about among so much magni-
ficence.
** * *
“ His Natural Life,” which was staged on
Saturday at Sydney Royal, is a little more horri-
ble even than it used to be. In the old days it
was a cheap melodrama, whkh was wont to turn
up in all its grisly pomp at small outside theatres,
where it hadn’t room to spread to advantage, but
on the capacious stage of the Royal it has a chance
to exhibit its bony gruesornemss at full length.
It does this so successfully that Dampier will
assuredly disappear some dark night and be after-
wards found in the harbour, a swollen corpse, with
his pockets full of coppers to keep him down.
The first families of N.S.W. could afford to
ignore the thing when it hung out in obscure
halls in by-streets, but now the doings of their
ancestors are put before them so conspicuously
that they are bound to kick. The company
seems about as happy as the melancholy circum-
stances of the drama will allow, which statement
doesn’t commit this paper to any serious extent.
Mr. Dampier is good as Parson North, the drink-
sodden preacher of many pious intentions, and
Harry Leston makes Parson Meekin the burlesque
man of the play, which is about the best use that
could be made of Meekin. Mr. Plummer is
a gratifying ruffian as Captain Frere, and
,1. P. West does Gabbett —the individual who
used to take a fellow-creature along with him for
refreshments. There isn’t much enthusiasm about
the above notice, but The Bulletin lias long
given up any attempt to be enthusiastic over tins
drama. It lias seen somewhere about six separate
stage versions of “His Natural Life,” and the
best of them was calculated to make Marcus
Clarke’s unquiet ghost howl dismally in its
cemetery, like the dog next door yelping at the
stars. ,

SYDNEY BRANCH:

nent building)
Junction of Hunter, Pitt Sc O’Connell Street?.
Oa Saturday, May 6, Bland Holt invades
Sydney Lyceum with “A Million of Money” by
pettitt and Augustus Harris, another of those
vast spectacles in which a one-pint company gets
lost among a mass of three-quart scenery and an
avalanche of “props.’ Also, about the same
date, the Lynch Family of Bellringers will re-
appear in the N.S.W. capital after a very long
absence. Both these combinations will arrive
just about the time the new banking system gets
into full swing, and will probably be much sur-
prised to find that they have to take the notes of
all sorts of curious institutions at the door and
give 17s. 6d. change.

Harry Rickards’ show, at Sydney Tivoli,
continues to look exceedingly healthy, and if Mr.
p. sticks to business, and invests the proceeds in
the shares of some “ reconstructed ” bank, there
is no saying where he may not get to in his old
age. “ The Village Priest,” at the Cri. is appar-
ently good for another month at a low estimate,
and one or two other shows continue to keep their
heads above chaos.

“Hamlet” was done for one successive night
at Sydney Royal last Friday, and will be repeated
on Friday this week. Mr. Dampier’s habit of
devoting one night per week to Shakespeare is
commendable, but his tendency to pick out the
most lugubrious features of Shakespeare is emin-
ently depressing. Also, it is particularly rough
on Miss Lily, who is already relapsing into the
same depressed spirit which used to distinguish
her in past years. That young lady has been sys-
tematically cast for moist parts with big weepers
on them ever since The Bulletin first made her
acquaintance, and a course of Shakespearian
comedy would do her a world of good. Also, it
would do good to Dampier himself, who is an able
comedian when he likes to reVeal the fact, and it
would save this paper the painful necessity of
saying something severe about “Hamlet” at an
early date.

Lady Hopetoun, unofficially attended by
the suite “ on furlough,” patronised the last per-
formance of the horsey drama at Melbourne
Royal. During the Cup race, especially when the
pasteboard steeds were galloping past the Salt-
water River in the distance, her ladyship was ob-
served to smile with an air of genteel enjoyment.
This was a distinct triumph for the show, the
smile in question being a rare and costly article
never bestowed until after mature consideration.
ì
After supping off a crayfish, followed by a pound
of pork,
(Not to mention cheese and walnuts) Darrell
dreamed his greatest work—
Dreamed a drama built of corpses, poison, flames,
and crazy Strife-
Dipped his pen in blood next morning and com-
mitted “ Life for Life.”
Play begins with ghastly miser groaning on a
little bed ;
Villain wants his money-poison ! —nurse comes
in, “ My God ! he’s dead.”
Doctor Inman taking care of fatal lucre at the
time—
No receipt was sought or given ; miser’s confi-
dence sublime !
Artful villain points to Inman, p’lice arrest him
for the crime.
Vice triumphant; manly virtue shrieking in a
dungeon cell,
“ Save me from this silent system, take me from
this living Hell ! ”
Juries always disagreeing—nothing proved against
him ; yet
Inman’s kept in “solitary.” Oddest case you
ever met.
How does Heaven work his rescue in this hour of
dark distress ?
Who’s the boy for deeds of valour ? George,
“ reporter for the press !”
Never, since a daily journal learned the sacred
truth to twist,
Did so many prison warders fall before a press-
man’s fist.
Inman scales the spiky ramparts, dodging death
in many shapes;
Darrell intercepts the bullets whilst the other cove
escapes.
Months elapse, and, at the diggings, everybody
samples dirt.
George is there, in boots historic, crimson sash
and flannel shirt.
Edith Blande is tied in marriage to the villain —
crafty skunk !
Though upon the wedding-morning from his side
that virgin slunk
To her conscience-stricken father (villain’s pal,
and always drunk).
“ Fly with me !” says reckless doctor. “ You are
merely wife in name.”
“True, indeed,” replies the virgin, “but I
couldn’t live in shame.”
Villain enters further ructions—Darrell only
blithe and gay.
Dumb twin-brother of the miser dodders in upon
the play.
Drunken father meets “Dumb Witness” —thinks
him Hamlet’s father’s ghost—
Makes confessions—Edith listens—villain starts to
clear the coast;
Rushes with a knife at Edith—drives it softly in
her head.
GUI Dumb Witness (pantomimic) shows how lady’s
blood was shed —
All rush on and cry, “She’s wounded !” Darrejl
says, “My God ! she’s dead.”
Harrell (boots as heretofore, but flannel shirt of
brighter hue)
Making love and eating toffee, come to pull more
matters through.
Doctor once again in chokec ; villain also lumbered
now.
Edith Blande not dead, but anxious—smacking
hard her snowy brow.
“ Can’t we have another rescue ?” Darrell rather
thinks they can. ,
(Edith wrings his hand and murmurs, “Let us
seize the prison van !”
Change of scene, and other villains looking for a
chance to kill—
Enter coaches ! Battle ! murder ! Darrell reigns
triumphant still.
Other villains stop the escort, capture members of
the Force —
Edith Blande and gallant doctor ride away upon
a horse,
Which escape is not, however, more offence against
the law.
Both the fugitives are bogus—one’s a dummy
stuffed with straw,
Language fails to give a notion of the horrors
tightly pack’t,
Pack’t and jammed and stuck together in the
gruesome final act.
First they fetch the twin dumb brother, sight from
which the bravest shrink,
To the bedside of the father now about to die of
drink.
“G, those eyes! I cannot bear ’em,”moans papa,
as well he may ;
Then he makes some more confession, and his
spirit flits away.
Darrell (light blue shirt) is cheerful, deeming old
’un better gone;
Thinks of daughters, wants to tell them —bolts,
and leaves the job undone—
Unsuspecting daughter enters (Darrell must enjoy
the fun)
Glances round and sees a kerchief on the face of
poor old chap—
Naturally, she imagines, father wants to get a
nap.
Soon her simple mind is stricken by a superstitious
dread,
And she wanders to the stiff ’un with a dim, fore-
boding tread—
Lifts the cloth and cries, in anguish, “Not asleep,
my God ! he’s dead !”
Edith Blande is next discovered cursing two
remorseless men
In a dark and dismal gully ; but the mob comes
rushing then,
Rushing like a mighty torrent down the brightly-
timbered slope—
Roaring, “Let us hang the villain!” Round
his neck they slip a rope.
Darrell stops the execution —recommends a trial at
court „
(He the only pressman present, might have done a
grand report).
So they hunt the other villain, find him hiding in
a hut —
Bring a torch and fire the dwelling ! See that all
the doors are shut.
Out he comes, half-roasted demon ! Second villain
lays him low,
Life for life is law Mosaic, learned Darrell tells
them so.
Into last assassin’s stomach someone shoots an
ounce of lead—
To the stars the gentle zephyr whispers, “ 0, my
God ! he’s dead. ”
At Poverty Point.
Brough and Boucioault leave for Maoriland in June,
and rumour says that Anson then takes Sydney Criterion.
The Kendals in Melbourne after Xmas.
A niece of Premier Patterson’s is on the Melbourne
stage.
Mrs. Kendal has been enlightening an interviowerabnut
Walter Montgomery, who was desperately in love with
her at one time. Walter, as her manager, gave Juliet to
another actress, because Mrs. K., as Madge Robertson,
snubbed him. Yet she finds that Walter was kindness
itself, though so overwhelmingly conceited.
Why was the loveliest and most bewitching member of
the Gaiety Co. left behind in Sydney ?
Variety in Sydney, like variety in London, is seriously
interfering with the receipts of big-show managers.
Nellie Stewart can’t be returning to Australia as
reported, for Musgrove sends a new prima donna, Ellie
Clements, said, per invoice, to be charming, young and
tuneful. Joseph Tapley, a tenor well-known in London,
also comes. These artistes open, after the Terry Lyceum
season, in Grundy and Solomon’s "Vicar of Bray.”
Talking of the Achurch, a Melbourne man paints a
vivid word-picture of a scene aboard an intercolonial
steamer. Herbert Flemming lying asleep in his bunk 01 e
afternoon, whilst Charrington, with arms folded d la
Buonaparte, stands at the open door gazing moodily upon
the alumberer. f
George Anson produced “Grimaldi” under its other
title of “The Life of an Actress,” at the Crystal Palace
Theatre last month. G.W. A. has a beautiful faith in the
pathos of this old, high-falutin drama. In it he made
his first Australian appearance at Sydney some eight
years ago, and was astonished to find that it didn’t
paralyse them. Like all good, humorous actors, Anson
has a craving to shine in heavy parts, where he doesn t
earn a large percentage of his salary by his low-comedy
face alone.
Wybert Reeve has returned to the stage at Adelaide
Royal in “ Truth.”
The Argus, smearing treacle over “ The Mountebanks"
performance in general, says: “Mr. Howard Vernon finds
a congenial part in Pietro—indeed, in creating a long
line of characters, which, more than any others, displays
his peculiar vein of whimsical oddity : one would think
that Mr. Gilbert had Mr. Vernon, instead of Mr. Grossmith,
in his mind’s eye.” What saccharine nonsense ! Gilbert
drew hU characters according to the height of the people
to be cast for them, as a rule, and Vernon is several
inches taller than Grossmith to begin with. Moreover,
Vernon has not always played the little man’s parts, even
in Gilbert-Sullivan operas. Likewise, Grossmith retired
from comic opera years ago, and was never thought of in
re “ The Mountebanks.”
“Personally, I have a great regard for myself.” So
commenced May Pollard at a Tuesday performance of the
“Mountebanks,” and after repeating it two or three times
with appropriate pauses, she left Alfredo, while she walked
off the stage to the prompter. Appearing again, appa-
rently' re-assured, she once more—“ Personally, I have a
very poor regard for myself.” Another pause, with the
finger-tips in her mouth, while the audience felt they
would like to go behind to get the “gag” themselves,
and after one appealing glance at Alfredo, she muttered,
“It’s no use, I can’t remember it,” and the orchestra
drowned the smiles and beating hearts together. It is
said the same audience rushed the Princess’ the following
night, to hear what the “missing words” really were.
Amory Sullivan, sen of Barry of that ilk, shows his
belief in the ultimate federation of the English-speaking
peoples in a practical way. His first child was born in
England, the second in the States, the third in Victoria.
When Louise Jordan was playing Desdemona to G. C.
Miln’s Othello, at Melbourne Opera House, the burly
tragedian used to haul her out of the bed, and drag her
round the stage by her back hair. One night, accident
revealed a perfectly satiefrctory reason for Miln’s pro-
ceeding. Desdemona had gone to bed with her bools on.
Marie Fraser, not suited in Australia, as a rule, is on
her way to England, where a part in a new piece awaits
her. Probably her greatest success was made as Helen
Latimer, in “Sunlight and Shadow,” her opening part.
The abstemious Justice Foster confesses that the genius
of Signor Hazon warms and excites him. It may be
remembered that the Judge was partial to the adage “A
bird in the hand,” &c., and it is a peculiar coincidence
that that adage is Signor Hazon's choicest piece of Eng-
lish.
Haddon Chambers has had two complete frosts, but,
with his own persistency 7 , is still pushing on, consumed
with an unabashable belief in himself.
Foozleberg went to the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon
Association, for men only, expecting to hear about Sturt’s
Terrible Rite, but only heard a young lady on the piano.
They say a scion of nobility, who failed on the Mel-
bourne stage, was provided for on the military establish-
ment.
Toole’s denial of his engagement to Effie Liston will be
remembered in Australia. She is engaged to Frith, son
of the artist.
One of the candidates for a N.Q. electorate once tra-
velled in a sixpenny raree show as a wild man.
Fitzgerald Bros, took £6OO in two nights at Inverell.
Better than a race-meeting. The circus is mightier than
the sward.
“The Holy Day of the Proletariat” is an announce-
ment in connection with a dramatic and democratic
celebration to be held in the Temperance Hall, Sydney,
on the evening of May 7 1, under the auspices of the
Australian Workman.
Organist Wiegand’s recitals, at the Centennial Hall,
returned £2OOO to Sydney municipal revenue last year.
Chevalier, at latest, was building two new songs in
which he will come out as something other than a
coster. This is glad tidings. We have had the coster in
joy, in grief, in philosophic conviviality—the coster single,
married, and as a happy father. And now we want to
have the coster buried with all his honours thick upon
him.
Somebody says of Janet Achurch that “ she has nearly-
conquered her old, pernicious habit of saying nothing in
particular in portentous tones.”
Maggie Moore opens her Maoriland tour at Auckland
Opera House, May 5.
Lilian Tree plays in the “ Daughter of the Regiment,”
at Sydney Royal, under the baton of Hazon, in June.
Melbourne Alexandra is to let at £lO a week. The
Salvation Harray people are negotiating for the theatre
and will surely get hold of it presently. Several
years ago The Bulletin had arrived at the conclusion
that Providence intended the H’Aleck for the Harmy.
“Carados,” in the Referee, complains that Mrs.
Kendal has lost a lot of her “ reserved force ” through
playing to ’Murkan audiences, and now hurls forth the
speeches which she used to speak with suppressed passion,
&c. This is very sad for the London critic, but, after all,
the undemonstrative style is a matter of opinion. Sara
Bernhardt goes in for hurling forth pretty freely.
Mary Anderson is writing reminiscences—before she has
any.
The Little Nipper goes to London as a formidable rival
to Lonnen. His Nipship has been tor years unnoticed in
the Australian music-halls.
Boolhman and Co. try to force a theatre on Colling-
wood. This is an idea which has germinaUd in Melb.
theatrical circles since the Year One.
Ibsen’s “ Master Builder” is a London success ; Ellen
Terry almost kept the stage waiting, through rushing to
see a bit in one of her wails.
Three heroines in knickerbockers—Misses Hanbnry,
Terriss, and Pattie Browne-startled the audience when
the curtain rose on Pinero’s new comedy.
Now that Gilbert and Sullivan are Mends again, it
would be most interesting if Sullivan were to provide a
new bonk for “The Mountebanks.” Though nothing
further is needed to prove that Cellier utterly failed to
catch the Gilhertian idea, the experiment would demon-
strate how essential Sullivan’s fantastic music is to
Gilbert’s quaint libretto.
John R. Rogers, late Mr. Minnie Palmer, has “chucked ”
the show business, and now devotes his jaw and cheek to
booming New York land syndicates in London. When
last heard from, “ Yours Merrily ” was talking of himself
in print as a man ‘‘full of vigorous, active manhood, a
man quick to foreshadow a probable outcome, quick to
decide, and quick to carry out ideas.” That’s wonder-
fully like Rogers.
Mr. and Mrs. Essie Jenyns hope to strike Australia next
January.
Luscombe Searelle has been converted into a public co.,

LABOUR’S FUNERAL.
(Suggested by the Eight Hours' Procession of ’93)
(FOR THE BULLETIN. )
“ Triumphant Labour’s annual parade ! ”
The idle catch-phrase of the fool, —
Shall we
Find food for triumph in a cause betrayed ?
Or birthright bartered ? Rather should this be
The funeral of Labour. We have played
Th’ farce unto the end. Lo, all may see
This skeleton.
Yet, not so long ago
This pompous pageant was no vain pretence;
No meaningless and tawdry-tinselled show ;
There ivas a time when it conveyed a sense
Of strength unto th’ worker, —of defence.
And now!
What little is there left? It’s flame
Without th’ heat. Th’ vital spark is dead.
All that remains to Labour is her name.
The good has vanished ! Lo, we have instead
The shadow of a past —and present shame.
Yet we have wooed our fate : and we must bear
The weight of our transgressing; we have brought
Dismay upon ourselves. The load is where
We fools have placed it. For our creed had taught
Us, “ Unity is toil.” ’Twas ours to share
A common lot but each apostate sought
To crush his fellow.
And for the result,
Let idle hands and empty bellies show 1
Our thousands starve ! And yet, we might exult
Could we but profit by our present woe,
And learn the lesson that the past can show. •

In his official report for 1892 on the sick
paupers of N.S. Wales, Professor Anderson Stuart
observes that ‘‘a very large proportion of these
patients should, by exercise of the most ordinary’
prudence, have saved funds which Would have
precluded the necessity of seeking hospital relief
at public expense.” The poor are the butts of the
well-to-do world. They are the sinners of the
preacher, the criminals of the law, and the per-
sonation of extravagant w’aste in the eyes of the
social economist. Considering the year that 1802
was, not only for manual workers, but for all with
narrow incomes, the increase in the numbers of
public patients should surprise no one. But what
will astonishthe reader of thereport is that thecom-
plainant, whose name is signed to the document,
is the same Dr. Stuart who has been pocketing the
funds of the N.S. W. public at a rate which has
caused Parliament to rebel'and cut his income
down by <£soo. This same Stuart who writes that
the sick poor of Sydney should not in such a year
as the last have poached so on the public, was
drawing from the same public while he wrote the
lines <£loo for one thing, <£ooo for another, <£o3o
for another, .£l4O for another, besides enjoying
various other substantial perquisites and privileges.

An old western identity, A. B. Rae, has
just died at Forbes, N.S.W., aged 73. He
originally settled at Bathurst as a photographer,
and afterwards founded the Western Indepen-

mond Thatcher, while acting as Rae’s locum tenens,
once let him in for libel damages by a ferocious
article, in which reference was made to the “tears
that ran down the classic nose ” of a local resident
—who, it turned out, had no nose at all.
The sexagenarian ex-Agenfc-General James
Munro, of many defunct Melbourne banks, has
been brutally assaulted by a ruined depositor—a

nothing to boast about. The depositor jumped
on Munro in the street, and ere he could be
dragged off the ex-Premier was a mass of ruins.
The assailant has since been fined £5. In common
justice, Munro ought to have been ordered to put
up the £5 and deduct it from the poor man’s fixed
deposit, but nothing was said about that.
London papers talk about a mystery at
Windsor Castle. This particular mystery, like
most others, is of the feminine gender. The lady
is young, beautiful, and accomplished, and never
ventures beyond the Castle domains. The world,
it appears, is shut to the fetching mystery because
she has no name and no legal standing as a social
ego. She, however, is addressed as “Your High-
ness,” and is served by attendants of rank. The
mystery cannot elucidate herself, and Our Gracious
Queen is believed to be the only person holding
the key. It almost looks as if someone had
started a little baby-farming business at the Castle
20 years ago.
Legislator Trickett, of N.S. W. Council, is
still receiving compliments re his little recent joke
about the artist in Government employ who drew
his salary. Trickett firmly believes it original,
and that it burst from him without study or pre-
meditation. But it is an age now since the
jokelet was born. In London edition of Detroit
Free Press, published Feb. 18 last, however, it
was trotted out afresh, the Government artist
there being made to draw 18,000 dols. a year ; and
a comparison of dates will show that a N.S.W.
Legislative Councillor would just have time to
read, mark and inwardly digest the witticism
between the arrival of the Free Press and the
debate on the local artist’s salary.
Another incident in “the making of
Australian history ”: One night Parkes came
down to N.S.W. Assembly “on swift drome-
daries ” to move a motion of censure on Dibbs.
Certain supporters of Dibbs were wavering (they
always are). Everything was ready; the Op-
position tocsin had sounded, the House was full,
and the reporters were waiting to “ take ” Parkes
verbatim. There sat the man from Brummagem,
but never a word said he. Hour followed hour,
and still the great statesman was mysteriously
silent Why? No doubt a profound
piece of diplomatic subtlety Long
afterwards the reason was discovered. Parkes had
forgotten his teeth !
The late Chief Justice Higinbotham, as
was well known, could seldom refuse a petition
from the needy. When at the bar, his legal
brethren, among whom were the present Judges
Williams, Holroyd, a’Beckett, and Hood, estab-
lished a joking custom of “passing on” any
applicant for relief. The first set of chambers
nearest the street, now occupied by Purves, Q.C.,
were then in the possession of the late John
M‘Farland, distinguished as a common law
pleader and authority on mining law. Whenever,
in response to his bluff “ Come in !” the door was
opened by some seedy wanderer in search of alms,
John would cut short further argument on the
threshold by exclaiming: “Mr. Higinbotham’s
chambers are upstairs !” The old man’s chambers
are probably still Upstairs.
Leo Byrue, the clever 12-year-old boy-
actor —son of J. Edgar Byrne, of Brisbane, a
pressman known all over Queensland as “ Bobbie”
Byrne—has played before Her Gracious at
Windsor, under Henry Irving, who spent £5OO to
reproduce on the small stage in the Waterloo
Chamber a miniature of the London Lyceum
scenery. Leo, who was taken to England in the
train of David Christie Murray, has been among
some of the great folks in England. Gladstone
took a fancy to him, writes a Bulletin corres-
pondent. “How do you like England!” asked
theG.O.M. “I don’t like it at all,” piped the
Bananaland boy, frankly, “I think the Govern-
ment is ruining the country.” He had heard
somebody say so. Most actors (like most London
cabmen) are Tories. Leo, one night, seriously
asked Irving if he would care to sell the rights of
“Becket.” “Well,’’replied the tragedian, “you’d
better write Lord Tennyson about it.” “ But I’d
prefer to do business with you,” rejoined the
infant audacity. “In that case, I shall have to
consult Loveday and let you know. But what
part do you propose to play yourself ?” “ Well, t
should play Becket, of course; but I think I
should play the King in the second act of the
camp-scene as well.” “Now, do you know,”
added Irving, “that’s just what I should like to
do —play in all the good scenes in my own part,
and in all the good ones in Mr. Terriss’s, too.”
If Leo Byrne grows up to be the same stamp of
man as his father, and aspires to tragedy, his
Hamlet should be a striking contrast to that of
Irving, the long, gaunt skeleton. “Bobbie” is
short of stature, bull-necked, rubicund, and Heshy,
and wears spectacles and a No. 8 hat. Leo
follows his father in cranial formation. “Bobbie’s”
nickname in “the Gulf,” years ago, was “The
Cob.”
“ Mr. Abington’s ” spook inspires corres-
pondents to agitate The Bulletin on his behalf.
“ R.S.T.” writes: “Reminiscences of ‘Jock’
Baird (‘Mr. Abington’s’ relative) are rather
‘mixed.’ I hail from his part of the world, and,
many years ago, had a considerable knowledge of
the family. His name was not ‘Jock’ but
‘ James,’ and ho was generally known as ‘ James
Baird, of Cambusdoon ’ (his place in Ayrshire).
He was not an uneducated boor. No Scotsman in
the good old days of the parish schools (now
swamped by the Boards) had to go without an
education, and Baird was a shrewd, sensible man.
Neither did he say ‘mon’ for ‘man.’ This is a
form of Scotticism peculiar to London Punch and
other Sassenach ‘ comic ’ papers. The person
whose name was connected with Baird’s in ‘The
Lord’s Prayer ’ yarn was not ‘Jimmy Murray’
but James Merry, a great iron-prince (and one of
the founders of the still-extant firm of Merry and
Cuninghame, Limited), and for many years M.P.
for Falkirk Burghs. At an election meet-
ing, a political weaver asked Merry if he
would vote for the abolition of the Decalogue.
Merry whispered to a supporter—‘ What the
devil’s the Decalogue?’ ‘Flogging in the army,’
said the wicked misinformant. ‘I am willing to
bring in a Bill for the Abolition of the Decalogue!’
shouted Merry to the crowd. The ‘ Murray ’to
whom you refer was, I think, dead before that
time. It was an open secret that he was the son
of a certain royal lady, who lived about the
beginning of the century, and a well-known
Scottish nobleman, whose union was not blessed
by the Church. The story about Baird’s legacy
to the Church is not true. Baird gave half-a-
million of money (not .£250,000) to the Church of
Scotland. The fund is still known as ‘ The Baird
Trust.” A paper once characterised this as the
largest fire-insurance premium ever paid.” . . .
“Duncan Macallum ” writes to say that it was
“Sandy Baird, the brother of Jock,” who made
the “Lord’s Prayer ” bet with Merry, and adds
that, when the Bairds gave the half-million dona-
tion, they were one of three families in Britain
that paid income-tax on a million. Also, “ A
coal-miner asked Merry, at an election-meeting—
‘What’ll ye vote for, Jimmy, an’ ye get in?’
‘ I’ll vote for the duty aff sape, ye , so’s ye
can wash yer dirty face. ’ ”
AVOIRDUPOIS.
“They tell me that mit the incomes-tax I must
pay somethings for every pound I make, an’ I
have gain ten pounds since I kill ze last pig.
Mein Gott! dese tings makes me vild.”
A Great Author’s Unrest.
Dickens describes his feelings when about to
commence a new novel, in a letter which he wrote
to Leigh Hunt in 1855, when he was contem-
plating writing Little Dorrit: “lam now,” he
writes, “in a wandering, unsettled, restless, un-
controllable state of being about to begin a new
book. At such a time 1 am as infirm of purpose
as Macbeth, as arrant as Mad Tom, and as rugged
as Timon. I sit down to work, do nothing, get up
and walk a dozen miles, come back, and sit down
again next day, again do nothing, and get up, go
down a railroad, find a place where I resolve to
stay for a month ; come home next morning, go
strolling about for hours and hours, reject all
engagements to have all my time to myself, get
tired of myself, and yet can’t come out of myself
to be pleasant to anyone else.”
A feeling something akin to the great novelist’s
is experienced by every sick person. They first
consult their doctor, but derive no benefit, then
commence taking the cheap advertised quack
medicines, with no result, and begin to despair of
ever regaining strength. If they would only, in
the first instance, commence a course of Clements
Tonic, their physical troubles would soon be at
rest, for this remedy is a sure and positive cure
for every disease due to a debilitated and im-
poverished state of the system, whether it makes
itself known as Neuralgia, Indigestion, Liver
Complaint, or in any other form. For a case in
point, read what is said by Mr. John George,
miner, Hetherington, who writes on January 28th,
1893: “For some time I have been a great
sufferer from weakness, owing to an illness I had
some years ago. At times after forcing myself to
eat I could not retain it on my stomach. I be-
came so ill at last that I found it impossible to
work at my trade as a miner for three days run-
ing. A friend of mine who had derived benefit
from taking Clements Tonic, advised me to try it;
well, sir, I am happy to say my strength and
appetite increased daily, and I have never lost a
day’s work since through illness. I am only too
happy to recommend it on all occasions to those
who are suffering from a weak and debilitated
constitution. —Yours gratefully, John George,
miner, Hetherington, North Lambton, New South
Wales.

Up to date no move has been made by
Labour to embody the memory of Higinbotham.
The Bulletin still thinks a cheap volume of his
fine radical utterances the best form for a memorial
to take.
It is significant that wherever S.A.
National Ass worked hardest to “purge the
rolls,” there the Labour-party polled strongest.
The publicity of the Ass movements kept the
labour men awake.
S.A. Labour men were chided for run-
ning two candidates in certain constituencies. As
it happened, where they ran one it resulted, in
some cases, in a Tory politician being elected as
the second member.
After Dr. Culpin, an aitchless candidate
for Oxley (Q.), had concluded his electioneering
oration, an admirer stood up and proposed a vote
of thanks to the Doctor for “ ’is ’ighly heducated

The Queensland elections’ tribunal Judge
will have a rough time after the general elections.
Many old returning-officers, after vainly en-
deavouring to elucidate the contingency - vote

George Riddoch, elected by a very narrow
majority, is the only member of the new S.A.
Parliament who had the pluck to say to the elec-
tors—“ Gentlemen, my policy is that of the
National Defence League.”
As The Bulletin months ago stated,
Dibbs inclines to appoint several members, two or
three Labour men among them, to N.S.W. Upper
House during the approaching recess. John
Davies must be discounted somehow.
White Queensland must kick out M‘Master,
Annear, Hamilton, and Little (Ms.L.A.), at all
hazards. They claim to be working men, but
have all been traitors to white Queensland. Be-
tween rogues and fools there is no choosing.
Rutledge, M.L.A. (Q.), speaking at Cook-
town in 1888 “If ever land-grant railways are
introduced into Queensland the protest will be—
dynamite.” Still, this ex-Wesleyan parson opposed
every single amendment against M’llwraith’s
system.
Not one honest voter should give a vote
to any* of that host of “commission agents,”
“stock and station agents,” and “auctioneers”
who now swarm round the Queensland constituen-
cies as candidates like blowflies round a bogged
bullock.
S.A. Labour-party, which got much sup-
port from those outside the labour ranks, will bo
politically abolished shortly. A new party, to be
called “The People’s Party,” is to be formed to
iduoate the country, mainly for the approaching
Legislative Council contests.
Kingston, Q. 0., promises to introduce
legislation prohibiting newspaper - proprietors
charging for the publication of the speeches made
by candidates for Parliament. This is ungrateful,
for neither Adelaide daily charged him anything
for reporting his three columns.
What will be the action of professedly-
hard-up Australian Governments in re the Cana-
dian Pacific Steamship subsidy? Will they have
sufficient backbone to affront the Imperial authori-
ties by refusing to subscribe, or will they support
the scheme as a means of obtaining titles ?
Chinamen, in straggling but constant pro-
cession, are now overlanding from Port Darwin to
Westralia. John pleads “no savee, no havee, no
payee” when asked for horse-tax, goes to gaol
with bland resignation, and turns up “flee man”
after a due course of Government fattening.
About the liveliest election fought in S.A.
was for Light district, the contestants being
Speaker Coles and White, the old members, and
the clever Paddy Glynn, an Adelaide Democratic
lawyer. Paddy was defeated by 4) votes, and his
defeat was a great blow to the Democratic party.
Recall O'Shauassy again: “ Whenever
Australian Federation is mooted, Imperial
Federation will be drawn as a red-herring across
the trail.” That is changed. Now the behind-
scenes saying is, “ Whenever Imperial Federation
is mooted, Republicanism is drawn across the
trail.”
The S.A. Advertiser, the alleged Liberal
organ of South Australia, was so incensed at
the gruelling given to Rounsevell, Cohen, Grayson,
and other rich men who had purchased its space
(at four guineas a column) for the insertion of
their election addresses, that in a leader it sug-
gests the creation of a few “ nomination beroughs
which could be given to able men belonging to no
particular section and standing in the interest of
the country as a whole.” Is this a feeler thrown
out by the beaten National Ass?
James Mirams
in one breath re-
ferred his fellow-
Victorians to
Munro, Shiels
and Company for
the “ proofs ” of
his (Mirams’) un-
lawful conviction,
and in the next
complained that
the Crown had
“cruelly and with-
out justification”
ruined his reputa-
tion. Yet Munro
and Shiels were the
“ Crown ” at the
time of little
Jimmy’s impri-
sonment. He is
very mixed in his
distress is Mirams.
What strikes one
most is his confu-
sion of mind as to
how he got into
prison, and why
he wasn’t imme-
diately taken out
again. He seems
to charge all his
troubles to the
Crown, which
knew of his per-
fect innocence, but
kept the matter
dark. Therefore,
we are left to
imagine another
Crown being fully
alive to the injus-
tice of proceeding
against Matthew
Davies, but pre-
serving a sullen
silence on that
part of the ques-
tion. And the
loud, shrill voice
of Mirams calls
upon Victoria to
see that the Crown
does no more mis-
chief, by allowing
a jury and judge to interfere in matters
which they do not understand. If the loud, shrill
voice means anything different, it fails to make
itself clear.
In Australia the Departments of Educa
tion uniformly decline to insure their buildings
against fire. The retrospect shows that so small
is the fire-risk that at the lowest assurance rates
tlie Governments would pay more to insure then-
schools in one year than they have lost by confla-
grations in any ten.
The members of the N.S.W. Ministry are
said to bo in mortal dread of messengers. Their
proceedings are discussed among certain mem-
bers of the Opposition half-an-hour after the
Cabinet rises. A recent important Cabinet was
held on board a boat, and the Ministers were
actually suspicious of the waves.
M‘llwraith in May, 1888 ;
I pledge myself not to bring forward the Transcon-
tinental or any other railway during the next Parliament
(18SS-93). (Cheers.) I cannot change ray principles, but
I toil you what I will do, and I shall bo scouted as a liar
all over the colony if I depart from my word in the
slightest respect.
Well, he is scouted.
When an M.P., who is solicitor to a
Municipal Council, drafts a bill at the Council’s
direction, receives pay for the work, and after-
wards supports that bill by speech and vote in
Parliament, may not his Parliamentary action bo
regarded as vitiated by private interest? One
or” two attorneys in N.S.W. Parliament are
thus circumstanced.
William Redmond struck a true note of
human sympathy in calling out, “Parnell shall
not be forgotten this day!” when the second
reading of the Irish Home Rule Bill was carried
in the House of Commons (by a majority of 43).
By the way, we wonder how “ Willy ” gets on with
“ Tom ” Curran now ? When the elder Redmond
became engaged to Miss Dalton, the animosity of
Curran was somehow aroused, and he gave “Willy”
“ a father of a bating.”
THE BUSY RUSH IN BUSINESS LIFE
Wears out the mental as well as the physical
organs. Wolfe’s .Schnapps will strengthen bo‘h,
so that they may perform their duties with
efficiency.
In place of Parson Rowe, banished by the
Wesleyana from Adelaide to Perth because of his
aggressive democracy. Parson Berry has come
from Auckland (M.L.). In an interview, he
rejoioes over the Adelaide Labour victories, be-
cause he believes in the representation “Rather of
brains, blood, and muscle than of broad acres,
banking-books, or bricks and mortar.”
Nelson (Q.), M‘llwraith’s Treasurer, re-
gards a surplus of three millions exports over
imports as a sign of returning prosperity. So they
would be but for Queensland’s debts ; as it is these
millions represent absentee loot-money. The
more money the absentees loot the better off are
the looted ? This is Land Grant Railway econo-
mies. Also “ heaven-born financing.”
The N.S.W. Labour-party has forced to
the front things that would have remained in the
background for another half-century. Dibbs is
committed to income-tax before an increase of
Customs duties; both the Freetrade leaders,
Parkes and Reid, are pledged to land-value taxa-
tion ; all three have declared for village settlement
after denouncing it as an invention of the Devil.
Premier Downer (S.A.) is now casting
around baits to reconstruct his Ministry on a
coalition basis. Let the Labour party cultivate
the wisdom of the serpent—let it remember, first
and last, that its unity is its strength. No office,
no billet, no axe to grind—this should be the per-
sonal ideal of the Labour member. “To do any-
thing for the people you must do nothing for
yourself.”
The new S.A. Assembly consists of five
agents, six squatters, six lawyers, seven farmers,
two auctioneers, five “gentlemen,” a merchant,
an architect, a printer, an engine-fitter, a black-
smith, a gardener, a collar-maker, ja wood-mer-
chant, a tanner, a labourer, a stevedore, a stone-
cutter, a doctor, an architect, and a miner. Broadly
speaking, only 19 are “workers” out of the 54
members.
The “ loyal” Tories, when things don’t go
exactly as they wish, are as rowdy as the common-
place Fenian. At latest, a crowd of Unionists
had been hooting Gladstone at the House of Com-
mons ; and a lot of Tory Ms.P. started a riotous
demonstration in the lobby, and had to be shifted
SILTED UP—A REASONABLE EXPLANATION.
PROUD SYDNEY CITIZEN : “There now, there is a harbour that will float the
navies of the world! ”
NEW-CHUM : “I see! but what is the dredge doing there?”
PROUD CITIZEN : “Well, you see, it’s near the baths sometimes used by
members of our Parliament.”
by the police. That’s what will happen to the
Ulster army : they will all be arrested and fined
forty shillings or a week.
B. D. Morehead’s recent electioneering
tour through his constituency wasadismal failure.
At Cunnamulla ho was driven from the plat-
form by the infuriated unemployed of the
district and had to escape with his supporters by
the back door. At St, George, the chief town of
the Balonne, his paid agent had to hire a circus
band to go out of town to meet Morehead (on a
Sunday, too—shades of John Knox !). Next day
the great man’s agent tried to promote a banquet,
but people wouldn’t buy enough tickets to pay
expenses. A broken-down potentate, engaged to
tout with tickets on commission, sold £l2 worth
and managed to lose the money at the circus.
This dreadful frost was a striking contrast to the
genuine reception given Morehead five years ago,
when he professed opposition to land-grab rail-
ways and slave-labour. On the contrary, the
supporters of F. Davis, the Labour candidate,
raised the money for his expenses at their first
meeting, and no helper is receiving a penny.
Bruce Smith says he does not want office
inanyN.S.W. Government, and will not accept
it if offered for years to come. M‘Millan says lie
has pledged himself to his business partners to
refrain from taking office for a number of years.
Want scouts the idea of office, and even Jacob
Garrard disavows all inclination in that way.
What does all this mean? Nothing. They’ll
all be there when wanted—barring, perhaps,
Bruce Smith and when they think they’ll
be able to stick to the Treasury benches for four
weeks in succession. Take up Tom Slattery’s
assurances, in public and private, that for eight
years to come he would devote himself to his legal
business solely, only holding his seat in the House
to keep himself in touch with events, and note him
three years afterwards panting to the front to
grip a portfolio, and, having gripped it, clinging
to it like grim death to a nigger. Tom is one,
Dibbs is two, Copeland’s three, Lyno is four—
and they’re all in the same old game of bluff.
Hundreds of persons who have used Ayer's
Hair Vigor attest its value, as a stimulant and
tonic, for preventing and curing baldness, cleans,
ing the scalp, and restoring the youthful colour to
faded and gray hair.
An appalling number of “agents” con-
tested the 8. A, elections.
The other day a deputation of 2000 MeL
bourne unemployed, on their way to the Treasury
to interview Premier Patterson, stopped to cheer
in front of the Argus office. This in recognition
of the Argus opposition to the sale of the State
railways.
The result of S. A. elections is the complete
ignominy of the Downer Government and the
National Ass. Works Minister Grayson and
Treasurer Rounsevell were beaten, Minister Howe
got in by the skin of his teeth, and Downer would
have been left out had the opposing Labour men
settled their differences. As for the Ass, its
nominees were defeated almost everywhere where
the people could sort them out. In most districts
they fell over themselves in the effort to prove
that they didn’t belong to the secret society.
The Age damns Gladstone’s Horae Rule
Bill because, for one thing—
There would he nothing topreventan Ulster Orangeman
who spoke sneeringly of the Vatican being arrested and
taken to a Roman Catholic district, where the influence
of the priests would make a conviction certain in spite of
all guarantees.
Surely Syme forgets the encouragement he gave
the N.S.W. Government when it shifted the trial
of the Barrier “ conspirators ” to a pastoralists’
district, where the influence of employers made a
conviction certain. Is that kind of thing only
deplorable in Ireland ?
Pierre Kvapotkin, prince and anarchist,
denounces Jason Lane’s Argonautic expedition to
Paraguay. He laments the cowardice of such a
confession of industrial defeat. He says : “ Make
the land ; be the dung which renders it productive,
build the centres of population which render it
valuable— and r/o away ! . . . Even at its best
a communist colony will only be a refuge for those
who have abandoned the battle which has to be
fought face to face with thejenemy.” True, and
if the new Argonauts were to emigrate to the
moon or the planet Mars instead of Paraguay, the
battle would still have to be fought by those who
remain.
Just before the S.A. elections, a few mem-
bers of the Labour-party arranged with the owner
of a local donkey to rent it for polling-day. Large
placards were to be placed on either side of the
beast with the legend—“ This is the National
Ass,” and Jack was to be led round the town by a
hired man. The night before the elections the
placards were printed and the hired man engaged.
Next morning the hired man and the placards
proceeded to the residence of the donkey, but
found him rigid in the grip of death. Adelaide
was spared a sensation, but the hired man, taking
it as an ill omen for the Ass, laid odds against
Martin Burgess’s crowd, and won a very small
fortune.
Gladstone, in his time, lias made 58
Liberals into peers, without assisting “ the party”
to any appreciable extent. His 53 peers have
mostly voted against him on all important ques-
tions, which is not remarkable, seeing that any
man who accepts a peerage is as strictly Tory as
the man—Gladstone, or anybody else— who recom-
mends him for the “honour.” When this fact
dawns upon British ignorance, and voters stipulate
that no so-ealled Liberal Government shall send
supporters to the House of Lords, the death-knell
of tliat ancient institution will lie sounded indeed.
But how can a Gladstone seriously discuss the
abolition of a House be delights to keep in repair ?
THE N.S.W. FAT MAN.
Part I.— His Misery.
The fat man shivered, the fat man shrank,
His thick lips slobbered the wine ho drank ;
His face grew pale though the sweat came forth,
His rheuraed eyes trembled’twixt fear and wrath ;
His stomach fell and his cheeks grew lax
As he muttered the words, “ Oh, that Income-tax !”
Part 11. —His Joy.
The fat man chuckled, the fat man cheered,
He laughed and chortled, he winked and leered ;
His fat sides shook and his red ears flapped,
And with glad emotion his hands he clapped.
“Ho ! ho !” he cried, “ here are pleasant fax—
The ’Ouse.has slaughtered that Income-tax !”
Aut-keus.

It is not an unusual, though a very in-
decorous, thing to see members of N.S.W. Parlia-
ment signalling to females in the ladies’ gallery,
or to see females signalling back to members on
the floor of the House. It is also a common thing
for members to go up and sit with female friends.
Why not allow the ladies to come down and sit
beside their pals on the floor of the House? It
would save time. The ladies’ gallery of the Com-
mons is screened off from observation by an iron
lattice. In Sydney, it is quite open, and as it
faces the Opposition benches, a good deal of posing
to the gallery takes place. The sooner the ladies’
gallery is screened off, or boarded up (or, better
still, boarded out), the better for all concerned.
* * «
The fascinating “ pivotess ” of a recent
Australian cause celebre has been the cause of
much spectacular shuddering. Her wrathful hus-
band used to profess a consuming desire to get
hold of her cavalier servente and to.drink his blood;
while the cavalier chafed morosely under the mis-
fortune of never being able to meet the husband
for similar purposes of mortal combat. The rivals
were in the habit of calling pretty frequently at
the same Melb. office of business, but they never
seemed to time their visits together. Each knew
of the other’s calls, and both deplored the cruel
fate that kept them apart. Hubby would
“tragede ” and say : “ Have I missed the villain
once more!” and, half-an-hour later, Cavalier
would roar: “Will he never-r cross my path?”
The firm that tenanted the office looked forward
with horror to the inevitable encounter between
these desperate men. After a long period of
strain upon everybody’s nerves, it chanced that
Hubby caught a glimpse of Cavalier in an adjoin-
ing office, whereupon, gathering himself up to
rather less than his full height, he peacefully
stepped out of the other door—the door round the
corner, as it were. The firm breathed more freely
after this. Another week or two, and Cavalier’s
gleaming eyes “spotted ” Hubby through a glass
door. “ Get that man out of the way or there’ll
be mischief done,” he muttered. A couple of
clerks hastened to coax away Hubby, and were
relieved to find that he fled in an obliging manner.
Then the breathing of the firm became almost
normal. Finally, these enemies to the death met
on the stairs, face to face. For one brief instant,
the colour vanished from their lips. The crisis
had arrived. Then each raised his strong right
hand to shake the other’s, and from that time for-
ward the fend was seemingly forgotten by mutual
consent. This is a true story, showing how a
tragedy was narrowly averted by two striking .
instances of presence of mind.
Touching the ad-
missibility of the
evidence of Mrs.
Archer (wife of the
man accused of a
recent Sydney murder
and ravishment) dur-
ing the coronial in-
quiry, it may be men-
tioned that there is
at present before the
Imperial Parliament
a Criminal Law
Amendment Bill,
drafted under the
supervision of the
Lord Chancellor,
which, if it becomes
law, will remove
doubt in all such
cases. The Bill pro-
vides that in criminal
cases a wife’s evidence
shall not be taken
unless the accused
husband gives express
assent. It will, of
course, be similar
when it is the wife
who is the accused.
The Bill does not
apply to coronial in-
quiries ; but if the
law be plainly laid
down as above, cor-
oners will be obliged
to take heed lest they
do at an early stage
what is against law
at a later.

At a recent Australian licensing-appeal
court an application for a license was strongly
opposed by an inspector of police on the ground
that applicant, an unmarried woman, was habi-
tually drunk. She denied this, of course, and
mentioned that she had excellent references from
well-known people. “ Whoever,” said the in-
spector, “ would give a woman like you a character
must bo worse than yourself.” The applicant
handed in the references, and the first one opened,
stating that the bearer was sober, industrious,
&c., was from—the Judge’s wife. And thereon
hangs a tragedy.

A Sydney matrimonial agency has had on

What is the matter with the professors of
music? That distinctly precious genius, Marshall
Hall, of Melbourne (the gusher who was moved to
maudlin tears, almost, in describing the nobility
of the self-sacrifice which impelled every truly
soulful man always to offer his wife the
first and most juicy cut from the family
leg of mutton instead of snapping it up
himself) the other day sent to England, for
production at the Crystal Palace, a concert over-
ture of his own, accompanied by a description
thereof from the pen of the gifted author. One
theme, which he modestly declared to be “ rugged,
heroic, yearning, struggling, might,” he said, “ be

OEN.TAMIN JOWETT PHILLIPS, of Annandale,
begs most sincerely to thank the good people
who so kindly contributed the numerous beautiful
flowers, wreaths and crosses on the occasion of the
funeral of his late dear wife, to say nothing of the
equally beautiful letters of sympathy, especially one,
and that of a Christian minister. Mr. B. J. P. felt
particularly honoured by noticing in the procession
three of the clergy, other two being unable to atte.id
by reason of indisposition. He(Mr. Phillips)also begs
to thank the Organist and Choir of Palmer-street
Church, with whom the deceased was associated from
infancy, for their kindly forethought, in rendering so
sweetly two of her favourite hymns, viz., “ One
Sweetly Solemn Thought,” etc., and “Thou Knowest,
Lord,” eto., thereby enlivening and brightening up
the dulness and monotony which not unfrequently
characterise a funeral service.—BENJAMIN JOWETT

The son of an ex-
Governor of Queensland
was once humoured in
his then wild fancy to
become a real bushman,
by being attached to an
overlanding party travel-
ling with cattle from
Kilcoy to the Barcoo.
His turn-out was gor-
geous— riding-breeches of
Bedford cord, top-boots,
inch-spurs, revolver ami
pouch, the biggest stock-
whip procurable in Bris-
bane, brand-new cabbage-
tree sombrero witli pug-
garee and fly-net, green
goggles, and dandy short
coat. But his usefulness
was nil, and he was
within three days turned
over to the billet of camp-
cook. He stood this a
week and left. He after-
wards explained his dis-
gust thus : —“ It wasn’t
the menial work of the

know, but —ah when-
ever we got to a station
—ah the man they
called the boss—ah
would go and stay at the

And, as those fellahs

Dear Bulletin, Another love-story.
South Australia; Cobb & Oo.’s coach from the
far North, en route for Adelaide. Passengers: a
servant girl, a shearer, a parson, all strangers.
The first-named pair strike up an acquaintance,
which culminates in an arrangement for marriage
and a request for the parson to do the job at next
stopping-place. Arrived thereat, the bride retires
to “ fit ” herself, and the bridegroom and parson
proceed to arrange preliminaries in the dining-
room, “ What is your name?” Information
given. “ What is the lady’s name ? ” Bridegroom
(scratching his head): “Blessed if I know.”
Then, stepping to the door of the next room and
opening it slightly, he remarks to his future joy :
“ Here, you ! Come out here if you want to be
done.”—A Tent Dwelleu.

Dear Bulletin, —The cadets who lately

There is much weeping and wailing
amongst Australians (principally Bananalanders)
in England owing to the bad times in Australia
(says The Bulletin’s London correspondent).
Many establishments have been reduced, and
carriages “put down ’’ in consequence. But this
is not all; the worst is that some of the lady mem-
bers of the families affected look with dread upon
the prospect of going back to “that dreadful
island in the South Pacific,"as the quondam bank-
clerk now living “at home” designates the country
to which he owes what little he has in life.

Matters in England arc really very little
better than they are in Australia, and there is a
poor look out for a good summer season on the
Thames, owing to bad times on the Exchange,
whence most of the boating contingent is re-
cruited. Very few, even of those who have good,
old-established connections, are paying even office-
rent, and the catalogue of houses and flats to let
is the surest indication that money is tight.

Lady Hopetoun had no sooner returned to
Melbourne last week, than she withdrew herself
to Mount Macedon. In point of fact, it is offici-
ally impossible for the dark-eyed Countess to
remain at Government House whilst the Maddens
hold command. She couldn’t well play the rdle of
distinguished visitor at her own ungainly diggings
until such time as the Earl came back to be
Governor again, therefore, she got over the
solemn social difficulty by retiring to the
Mount, a place which suits her constitu-
tion. Meanwhile, Mrs. Madden and the Chief
Justice are reckoning on another “ go ” of vice-
royalty shortly, when the Hopetouns depart for
good, and they begin to feel themselves intimately
connected with the welfare of the country, as it
were. When you have the country’s welfare really
at heart, it must be nice to feel that you can do so
much good by going around and showing yourself
on all deserving occasions.

The once frigid Austral Salon now makes
an unmistakable bid for mass popularity. At the
last meeting discussions on abstruse psychological
problems were sandwiched with coster ditties in
costume, the evening being brought to a close with
the chorus of “ Knocked ’em in de old Kent-road.”
This is evidently a logical sequence to the Argus

It is an odd fact that this sort of evidence is only

A mem. for the reconciled Gilbert and
Sullivan : The Dowager Duchess of Sutherland
has been gaoled for six weeks for contempt of
court. Says the cablegram :
Two vans of furniture have been taken to the cell occu-
pied by the Dowager Duchess of Sutherland. Her cell is
decorated with blue plush, and has been hung with hand-
some tapestries and furnished with toilet requisites. A
waggonette full of trunks containing various “comforts”
was taken to the apartment. A confectioner caters for
the Dowager Duchess, who will be peimitted to receive
her friends. She is well provided with books and the
various newspapers, and has an attendant to wait on
her.
The Duchess’s “punishment” evidently consists
principally in the worry of packing up her best
bonnet and her other properties.

TO ANY LADY WHO WOULD LIKE ONE.
Dear Madam, if you be in need
Of something fresh to pet,
Why, here is such a chance indeed
As ladies seldom get—
A chance to claim an infant new
That’s coming by and bye,
A little fairy stranger due
In Melbourne next July.
By human eyes as yet unseen,
Unheard by mortal ear,
’Twill soon appear upon the scene—•
Uncertain little dear !
Bespeak it, Madam, while you may,
The time is drawing nigh ;
One cannot guess the natal day —
But certainly July.
An ever-changing dream of joy
For you at once begins ;
Your fancy flits from girl to boy,
Or pauses oft at twins.
O, will its hair be dark or fair,
This offspring of N. Y. ?
Or will its head look bleak and bare
In keeping with July ?
Tis unexciting to adopt
An infant that you choose,
Whilst bundles by policemen cop’t
Are nobody knows whose ;
But here you’d share the sentiment
(For which all women sigh)
Attaching to the great event
That happens in July.
Dear Madam “ Wanted,” prithee close
The bargain—tarry not.
Knit booties for the darling’s toes,
And trim a pretty cot;
Then rob the neighbours of their wits
By looking very sly,
And spreading round the rumour, “ It’s
Expected in July!”

John Manton (the eight-stone man who
had the misfortune to lose his twelve-stone wife in
a Melb. lake three-feet deep, and didn’t find the
poor woman until she was dead) is indebted to a
recent amendment in the law for his satisfactory
release from suspicion. Even in other days, when
a man accused of murder sat practically gagged
in the dock, they could scarcely have hanged
John Manton, but the case would have “looked
rather black ” against him for the rest of his life.
In England, up to the present time, the case is
always bound to look rather black against the
dumb person who basks in the shadow of the
gallows. Manton, thanks to the new law,
was able to open his mouth and blow away
any idea that he had deliberately drowned his
wife, or willingly allowed her to drown, the latter
being the more reasonable theory of the two.
He even gave a healthy complexion to his insur-
ance operations, going out of his way to mention
that he fixed the policy at £7OO because there was
“luck in odd numbers.” In short, Manton
cleared himself with his own evidence, and the
death of his wife ranks as one of those circum-
stances over which he had no control.
» m *
The real story of the Manton drowning-
mystery joint-policy is certainly funny. Mrs.
Manton had a keen eye to business, according to
the evidence of independent witnesses. She
thought that John looked delicate and that she
herself was suffering from heart-disease, and in
her truly feminine way she was anxious to get at
the insurance company. Indeed, it is possible
that she died very happy in the thought that she
teas getting at the company.
# * *
The joint policy money doesn’t seem
likely to do Manton much good, all the same. He
is one of those sanguine punters who believe they
can make a comfortable living by backing horses.
The most pathetic portion of his evidence was his
declaration that he “ usually had something to the
good after a race-meeting.”

Lord Teynham writes to the Times, giving
a copy of a letter he recently received from a
Colonel B -, proposing a matrimonial alliance
with a young Australian lady who is anxious to
marry a title. The ambitious young woman is
described as being an orphan, the happy possessor
of £19,009 a year and £280,000 cash. This offer
did not tempt the nobleman, who, instead of
jumping at the good thing, sat down and “ wrote
to the Times.” Who can the lady be?
The acme is for the detective to be co-
respondent.

There lived lately in Sydney an elderly
widow who kept a small store and had amassed a
small pile. Her name was Feeney, and she had
no relatives to consider in disposing of her accumu-
lations. She was a Roman Catholic, and some of
the Fathers and Sisters of that church frequently
advised her to make a will that would redound to
piety. But the old lady had a notion of her own.
She had considerable respect for two neighbouring
storekeepers in a somewhat larger way of business
than herself. With one of these this par. has
nothing to do. The other was a gentleman re-
joicing in the specially Irish name of Solomon,
But the Widow Feeney was illiterate, and, by
some unknown process, the idea penetrated her
brain and remained there that this storekeeper’s
name was “ Soolivan,” and that, therefore, he was
a countryman of hers. She executed a will, there-
fore, making Solomon and the other man trustees
of her little pile, which (after deducting a small
present of money and a diamond ring to each) she
directed to be distributed among charities, accord-
ing to the trustees’ judgment. Andvthis was how
the Echo Farm for inebriates came into an unex-
pected donation of £lO, the other day. The main
joke of this story is that it is absolutely true,
names and all.

When the Duke of Edinburgh was in

the “gay” sort. A certain Adelaide foot con-

night and went to sleep intoxicated. His in-

you were off duty at midnight; what are you doing

thought struck him. “Sh! Sorr! his Hoiness

Says Rosegger, a Styrian poet: —
If you think of marrying a woman remember you marry
three creatures—a young one, a middle-aged, and an old
one. Unless one or two die before their time, you marry
a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. In her you marry
a lot of people you do not know.
Rosegger has struck the weak point in the mar-
riage-contract. You marry a whole lot of women
you don’t know, and they quarrel with the bald-
headed wreck which isn’t you, but which has to
do duty for you, on the ground that he isn’t the
man they married but only a base imitation. It
all reminds us more or less of Donnelly’s tale con-
cerning the old woman who called up the disem-
bodied spirit of the young woman who once was
her, and the fepirit got fixed so that she had to
take it home, and live with it, and pass it off as
her newly-found sister. Only, instead of finding a
young girl, the average man finds an old woman,
and that is just what the trouble is all about.
A reverend gentleman of Castlemaine
(Vic.) has been whooping up the banks from his

men should refuse to listen to, and still more to
repeat, rumours about any bank,” cries the
excited reverend, and he winds up with a burst of
inspiration to the effect that the notes of all banks
trading in “the colonies” were as good as gold.
All this at holy worship on the “Sawbuth” morn!
A particularly hard case recently filed his

From a recent issue of Harper's Bazaar :
Such a droll little party that was the other day, given
by Mrs. Eugene Clarke in honour of her royal Japanese
poodle, Ootah. Ootah is a beauty, and is said to have
come to America directly from the Mikado's kennels.
Mrs. Clarke and her friends entertained the dainty little
dogs whom Ootah invited, serving them with chicken at
little tables six inches high. The dogs behaved perfectly,
and looked charming, dressed as they were in ruffles and
ribbons, and groomed as became their princely rank.
There were 20 of the little pets, and they proved their
claim to be caressed and adored by loving mistresses.

The steamer Industry sighted the sea-ser-
pent between Newcastle and Melbourne. “As it
rose it caused great commotion, and when 15 feet
above the surface commenced swinging its head
about after the manner of the giants in panto-

the portion of the body out of the water was
covered by large scales of a dirty brown and white
colour. Three times it rose in 10 minutes, and
then swam away toward the shore, leaving a
ripple behind it.” And yet, as Huxley has re-
marked, no one has ever yet found a scale or a
bone of the great sea-serpent.
THE LODGER.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Pals firm and fast
Were Fred and Dick,
Ideas they had in common ;
Long years they passed
In friendship thick,
L T ntil there came a woman-
A woman bright,
And kind and chaste,
With ne’er a thought of evil
She suited quite
Their “kindred taste.”
Bravo ! exclaimed the devil.
Dick glared at Fred,
His comrade true,
His former more-than-brother;
He wished him dead,
As lovers do
So often wish the “ other.” ,
Fred’s heart for Dick
Was full of hate
And envy, also malice;
It made him sick
To find his mate
Was likewise fond of Alice.
In days before
The lady fair
Filled both with sudden fancies,
They often swore
A solemn swear
To share each other’s chances
As long as life
Ran in their veins—
Delusive vision golden !
Who seeks one wife
The half disdains,
Or be she young, or olden.
Now, real grit
Was Richard, and
Than Al. no maid was sweeter
While Fred was fit
To take the hand
Of any human creetur.
The devil said,
“Be comrades still ”
(The artful, black old codger!)
“ If Fred must wed
The girl, he will
Have honest Dick as lodger.”

Will clip their wings, poor spotless things
When they begin to fly.

Upon the golden streams

Alas ! had turned to dust,
And fools will call a spade a spade,
But scandals aren’t “ good for trade ”
Forget the Southern Bust.
Suspicions are unjust,
They were the uppah crust;
The festive games of leading names
Must never be discuss’t.
Sabbath bells have ceased their ringing,
Sweetly on the morning air
Come the sounds of sacred singing
And the murmurs low of prayer,
Now the goodly pastor, rising,
Smiles upon his tender flock,
And in holy voice, advising,
Gives them points on banking stock.
Through the panes, whereon the Saviour,
Limned with all the glazier’s art,
Casts out those men whose behaviour
Turned His temple to a mart,
Steals the dim, religious light in,
And the worshippers in pairs
Meekly wonder were they right in
Parting with their tramway shares.
Blessed Sabbath, calm and holy.
Sweet surcease in thee we find ;
Soothed by grace the high bow lowly.
And the low are meek of mind.
Safe within the church’s portals,
Swell our hearts with boundless thanks
To the saint who’s bidding mortals
Put their faith—in rocky banks.

THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS.
Mr. J. B. Warbrick, or “Joe Warbrick,” as he
is familiarly known, was captain of the New
Zealand Native Football Team (better known as
“The Maoris”), which visited the Old Country
and gave such a good account of itself during the
season there of 1888-89. This team firmly believed
that St. Jacobs Oil is one of the secrets of success
in football, and kept itself in prime condition by a
free use of it. The team was so unanimous in its
verdict that the matter is worthy of special men
tion. Mr. Warbrick, in conversation with one of
the representatives of the Chas. A. Yogeler Co.,
in Sydney, after their return, stated: “I have
much pleasure iu testifying to the efficacy of St.
Jacobs Oil. I have used it constantly since my
first visit to New South Wales in 1884, having
then injured my knee in our first match ; and dur-
ing our tour in Great Britain we have used noth-
ing else, and the New Zealand Native Football
Team all speak in the highest terms of its
qualities. In fact, so much did we think of it
that we hardly ever travelled without a ease
of it.”
AN ENDORSEMENT.
Mr. J. R. Scott, the successful proprietor of the
leading hotel in Gisborne, N.Z.—the Masonic
Hdtel —and the able manager of the above-men-
tioned New Zealand football team on their tour
through Great Britain, endorses the above by
letter, in which he states : “ I have much pleasure
in testifying to the wonderful properties of St.
Jacobs Oil. While there (Great Britain) I got for
the team’s use nearly a dozen different embroca-
tions, but none seemed to do the men the same
amount of good as St. Jacobs Oil. In fact, we
never considered our baggage complete without a
case of it. ”
THE WATERBURY WATCHES
have established for themselves an unrivalled
reputation as ACCURATE, RELIABLE, and
INEXPENSIVE TIMEKEEPERS, and for all
practical purposes are UNEQUALLED by any
other low-cost watch in the world.
The export of wool from Australia during
1892, was 855,765,9711 b., 348,292,4601 b. of which

The speaking portrait of Miss Frances
Coghlan, M. 8., M.Ch. (Sydney University), pub-

“ Bobbie Burns,” a S.A. Register re-
porter, “ took” Premier Downer’s farewell speech

report in the morning’s Register.
The 48th annual issue of the “ Newspaper
Press Directory,” published by C. Mitchell and
Co., of Red Lion Court, Fleet-street, London, is a
complete and most useful work of, in most respects,
up to-date reference. A special article on “The
Rights and Liabilities of Newspapers,” and a digest
of thestatutes relating to the newspaper press passed
daring the Victorian reign, is a special and prac-
tical feature of the work. In the British Isles
there are 2268 newspapers ; 459 in London alone.
The “Supplement for 1893” contains, amongst
other information, well-written and fairly accurate
articles on “ The progress of Australasian trade,”
and “A short history of the Australasian press.”
We generously say “fairly accurate,” although
the S.M. Herald is represented as being in Aus-
tralasia what the London Times is in Europe. An
apology is due to either or both. The Bulletin
is not mentioned among “ the principal metro-
politan weekly papers” of Australia, which is
cheering, as tending to prove that The Bulletin,
the most widely-circulated and best-known of all
Australian publications, is recognised as cosmo-
politan. The “Directory ” includes lists of papers
published in all countries in the world.
Perhaps no harbour-site in Sydney sur-
passes, for picturesqueoutlook and business con-
venience, that upon which stand the extensive
and well-planned premises of the Sydney Coffee
Palace, at the junction-point of the Domain, Sir
John Young Crescent and Crown-street, Woolloo-
mooloo Bay; From the upper balconies and win-
dows the views obtainable are delightful, the
wooded Domain and an opposite promontory
enclosing a horseshoe inlet from the land-dotted
waters of the further Bay; while the Coffee
Palace is within five minutes’ exhilarating walk
to any of the business or pleasure centres of the
city’s very heart. Shorter promenades will take
one to the National Art Gallery, the salt-water
baths, the Public Library, the Museum, or the
Botanical Gardens. The building, charmingly
designed and of semi-oval ground-plan, is four
storeys in height, and contains, besides several
suites of rooms, double bedrooms, and other
accommodation for about 60 people, a ground-
floor reading-room, a first floor music - room,
balcony smoking lounges and recesses, two large
second floor dining-rooms, and all the numerous
lavatory, pantry, and laundry conveniences in-
separable from a well-conducted, thoroughly-
appointed establishment. In accordance with the
latest hygienic theories, all culinary and laundry
operations are carried on in the uppermost storey,
while the roof of the building is flat, after the
Eastern vogue, and asphalted, so that it makes a
fine promenade, or can be utilised as a skating-
rink. Comfortably furnished throughout, with a
cuisine varied to meet the tastes and requirements
of the most fastidious, and with charges fixed
according to a reasonable scale, the Sydney Coffee
Palace may be confidently recommended to all
comers.
Don't fish for sharks in a rain-barrel,
but print your advertisement where it will be seen. “In
my travels in Australia I found The Bulletin every-
where, and everywhere found it powerful,” wrote David
Christie Murray in the London Contemporary Review.
That is true. The universality of The Bulletin's circula-
tion in Australasia is the envy of all other papers. In and
beyond Australia, The Bulletin, now in its fourteenth
year of issue, is the most popular, best-known, best-
quoted, and most widely and numerously circulated of all
Australasian publications.

M‘llwraith’s anti-gridiron larid-grab effort
is to persuade Queenslanders that the syndicators
are willing to mop up land on a scale of values
averaging 6s. Bd. an acre. That lie comes in lirap-
ingly late. During the Griffilwraith Parliamen-
tary debates, hon. members —more or less disin-
terested —arose one after the other to prove that
the lands proposed to be exploited were valueless,
ot only worth at the most from 6d. to 2s. 6d. per
acre ! Nelson’s amendment to fix the value at ss.
an acre was defeated by 35 votes to 15; and
2s. 6d. remained the maximum expression of pro-

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The V.R.C. has decided to reduce the amount
of the club’s “added ’’ money by annexing in all oases the
stakes received from owners. This is just as effective a
means of retrenchment as the alternative scheme of
cutting down the old bonuses given to eacli race and still
leaving owners’s .veepstakes to swell the pool. Likewise,
it is a neater and more simple arrangement whereby the
winners will be spared the trouble of calculating the exact
amount of their prize money. Here and there an owner,
who seems to have a “dead bird” in one horse for a
weight-for-age race, may refrain from starting a “second
string,” but such occasional economies will be at the
expanse of the V.R.C. The Melbourne Cup can still call
itself a £lO,OOO race, and Considering how bad weather
and bad times combined against this year’s Spring and
Autumn meetings at Flemington, it comes as a cheerful
surprise to find that the com. have guaranteed to add
about £7OOO to their pet handicap. For Glenloth’s Cup
there Was £2817 of sweep money to be reckoned on, so
the Club is not likely to save more than three thou; next
time.

Instead of the usual annual picnic, N.S.W.
Licensed Victuallers’ Association will hold a race-meeting

In Melbourne much rowing takes place On Sun-
day morning on the Yarra. A certain rowing-man was
to be confirmed, and the clergyman required his attend-
ance upon one particular Sunday. The R.M. said
that was impossible: he had to pull in a crew training f.,r
a big race. “ Row on Sunday I Oh, how very dreadful I”
“ Well, you go for a walk on Sunday, and I row ; what’s
the difference ? ” “Oh! I can admire the beauties of
Nature.” “ Well, and can’t I, too? ” “ No, you’ve got
to keep your eyes in the boat.” Whereupon the rowing-
man caved in.

Roberts is indebted to a splendid physique for
his long reign as billiard champion. Kone of bis old
rivals could live Roberts’ life and preseiwe their “ foiin.”
Peall, the best stayer of thetti all, neither drinks nor
smokes, and probably Dawson, the latest star, belongs to
the new school of abstemious professionals. The wotid
grows more sober, as a matter of business, every day.

A general expulsion of “ stiff-’uns ” is threatened
among the Melbourne football clubs, and many of the
players who were last season suspecUd of “ cronk ” prac-
tices will be politely retrenched. One seaside club con-
templates “sacking ” no less than six of its members, and
the other clubs follow' close. The unemployed footballers
are understood to be forming a league for the redistribu-
tion of property ; such distributions to be effected by the
medium of a hnlf-brick in a stocking on dark nights.

Mr. Geurge Cheeke, junr., of the racing N.S.W.
Judge’s family, nephew of “Bill” Long, of Sydney, is
now a student of St. John’s College, Oxford, and was one
of the pair who represented the Dark Blues in the inter-
’Varsity four-handed billiard-match, which he and bis
partner won very easily. He had previously played for
the coveted “Silver Cue,” and though he had bad luck
through the game was only beaten by two points. He is
also a fair oarsman and rows in his college eight.

John Roberts once more comes out on top at
spot-barred billiards; he decisively beat Peall, to whom
he gave 9000 points in 24,000. Probably another 1000
points would have been needed lobring them together.
In the game he scored eighty-six three-figure breaks,
including one of 737. His other breaks—49l, 482, 471,
434, 385, 347, 322, 301, and twenty-eight of between 200
and 300. Peall scored thirty-nine breaks of over 100,
including runs of 334, 270, 221, and 200,

It may tend to renew English faith in “colonial”
securities when the news reached ’Ome, that Sydney’s
boss bookmaker, Humphrey Oxenham, was banqueted on
Tuesday night at Sydney Town Hall, undvr the auspices
of Cabinet Ministers and numerous members of the Legis-
lature. Good old Sydney ! However, all agree in saying
that there lives no straighter or pluckier sportsman than
he who bears the peculiarly old-English name of Humphrey
Oxenham.

“V.” writes: “Burrows, the jumper, is not a
Yankee, but of Lancashire (Eng.). He did not make a
world’s record for hop-step-and-jump. John Purcell
made over 49ft. Shanahan, in Ireland, cleared over 50ft.
in two hops and a jump. I saw M‘Manus perform, the
other day, and was surprised that such an old stager as
Tom Malone did not have the tape checked and the
ground tested with a level. The landii g-ground
was not dug up, so that M‘Manus could not let
himself out properly. I should not be surprised
to see the young Cornstalk beat 50ft., as, in shape
and size, he is the bean, ideal of a jumper ; but he
must be quick about establishing a record, for he will pro-
bably fall into flesh, and the necessity for weight-reductien
is fatal to spring and elasticity. By the way, in the
standing-jump contest at the Australian championship
matches, one try was allowed in which the jumper
stepped back after landing. This is irregular, as Malone,
of all men, should know. A similar mistake robbed him
of the English championship of ’Bl and the world’s record
for long-jump, a disallowed 23ft. sin.”
As baby-murderer Makin appeals against
being “ suspended prior to reconstruction,” there
is intense excitement in a warm corner.
The 350 or so Italians, indented a few
years ago as labourers for the Queensland sugar-
plantations, are mostly oystermen now.
Balfour, in his first big Home Rule speech,
gave the Tory cause away, saying what the Tories
would do in the event of the bill being passed.
Politicians never do this while there is a ray of
hope.
N.S.W. Treasurer See, on March 29 (objec-
ting to the establishment of a National Bank):
“ Any piece of paper is as good as a note. . . .
If a bank cannot give a sovereign for each note
issued it is insolvent.” Now.
The Queensland so-called “ Independent ’’
general election candidates are mostly traitors,
disguised nominees of MTlwraith and his gang.
Especially is this so in cases where “Indepen-
dents” stand in opposition to straight-out Labour
men.
Miss C. H. Spence, Adelaide’s sexa-
genarian lady apostle of democracy, draws this
broad distinction between the plutocrat and the
democrat: The first loves to monopolise what is
pleasant, beautiful, and luxurious; the second
wishes for nothing that his fellows cannot share
with him. She has congratulated N.S.W. on
possessing State owned railways and telegraph-
lines, an eight-hour day and strong labour unions.
Apropos the reprieve of Makin, the Sydney
baby-murderer, for three months, pending his
appeal to the Privy Council, the N.S.W. Attor-
ney-General says that it by no means follows that,
should the appeal fail, he will not be hanged.
Australian precedent (in the cases of Bertrand and
of Supple, whose appeals against capital sentences
failed before the Privy Council) is in favour of
non execution in such cases.
Melbourne Eight Hours’ Demonstration
this year suffered from depression. All its fizz
was in front with the two drags-full of pioneers,
who annually get fatter and more bell-toppered.
The ancient farce of stopping in front of the old
Treasury to play “God save the Queen,” for the
benefit of the caretaker’s sisters and cousins and
hunts, among whom a member of the Ministry may
perchance have strayed, was more farcical than ever;
Bryan O’LoghleU represented Patterson & Co;
dn this occasion; Nobody but the pioneers and
Bryan and his friends uncovered to the National
Anathema, and nobody but the Same fat persons
exchanged wheezy cheers; There was no other
cheering along the line; except by the Standard
section, who cheered the bricks and mortar of the
Argus, which echoed faintly. The most remark-
able point about the pioneers aforesaid was their
eagerness to doff and duck to everyone and every-
thing. They doffed and ducked to the pedestal of
the much-pending Eight-hours movement; to
Bryan O'Loghlen and Co.; to the Argus office, the
Town Hall, and most likely the Morgue, which
was also on the route. Perhaps it’s about tim’e
the pioneer fetish were squelched. It’s also time
the provinces fixed some day—the Ist of Mavj for
choice —for an Australasian Labour festival Union
Day;
The Queensland elections that take place
this Saturday should give some idea of tvhat the
general verdibt of Bananaland is to be. So fat,
MTlwraith has got his elbows well in the crack.
The members returned unopposed ate E. J.
Stevens (Logan), H. M. Nelson (Murilla), M.
Battersby (Moretoh), John Murray (Normanby);
A. Morgan (Warwick), and J. Leahy (Bullo).
All these, with the exception of Stevens and
Leahy, who are called “Independents,” are ac-
counted MTlwraithians. Stevens is a road-and-
bridges member, with squatting sympathies and
a fixed belief that members should not be paid for
their services ; in other words, he is aI at Man’s
darling, and he pays like a miniature Burdekin
for his voted popularity. He is the standing king
of Southport. Leahy is a newspaper man of
Thargomindah, and is more MTlwraithian than
anything else ; one of those men who are insig-
nificant abroad, but almighty on their own dung-
hill—his connections generally managing to mop
up all the local government billets. Nelson
is one of M'Hwraith’s colleagues ; has been his
opponent, and may be at any time anything
wax in the modeller’s hands. Battersby owes
his first political appearance in ’BB to MTI-
- patronage. Murray is, it may be
reasonably thought, more independent of MTI-
- favour than the others. Morgan is
a pressman and was distinctly anti-MTlwraithian
when Griffith and Mac. were at daggers drawn;
his mouth was appeased with the Chairmanship of
Committees, while his politics could always be
influenced by the promise of his cardinal desire—
the “ via recta,” or a direct railway from Brisbane
to Warwick, in addition to the present circum-
bendibus via Toowoomba. This Saturday, addi-
tional elections take place in 15 districts and to
fill 20 seats ; the results will see 20 members of
the new Parliament elected. The contests involve
the present fates of Ministers—MTlwraith (Bris-
bane North), Barlow (Ipswich), Byrnes (Cairns),
and Tozer (Wide Bay). Generally speaking, the
districts chosen for this first batch are MTI-
- strongholds, strongly contested only in
Brisbane; diverted with side issues in most other
districts, Labour candidates sometimes splitting
their own votes, and in others enjoying a splic
among their opponents. The Brisbane contest is
the crux—MTlwraith and Kingsbury against
Glassey and Lilley, with Raven as a farcical
extra. This however, is stated to appear
under the aegis of G. T. Bell, who is a MTI-
- barnacle, a Tasmanian exportee to Bun-
daberg in the first instance, and afterwards
MTlwraith’s appointee as Government auctionee r
in Brisbane. This means—(the missing word ?).


Such of the (Q.) Labour candidates as

Clairvoyancy and Illuess.
Dear Bulletin, —“Must one be ill to be a clair-
voyant,” asks “Dipso.” in a recent issue. Why,
certainly. 11l mentally, or malformed mentally,
which is pretty much the same thing—or to see
ghosts either. One has only to look at the por-
traits of the male and female ghost-seers in Stead’s
book of “ Ghost Stories ” to be quite sure of this.
No living man or woman, healthy in mind and
body, without any congenital malformation, eating
and drinking well, and taking sufficient exercise,
ever saw a ghost yet, or became a clairvoyant (so
called, apparently, because the condition is the
reverse of what the name would imply). They
may claim to have done both. In that case, take
them to a medical man who understands the art
of cross-examination (very few do, mind), and I
will wager Collins-street to a threepenny tram-
ride that one of the foregoing conditions is non-
existent.
The wonder is, not that so many people see
ghosts or that the coincidences of this pretended
clairvoyancy are so frequent, but that the reverse
is the case. For every one person who sees a
ghost there are five thousand who go through the
world without having had the experience, when,
according to all the laws of nature, they should
have done so. If there, is one thing quite certain,
it is that every single condition of the body and
mind (the thinking faculty) is absolutely con-
trolled by certain portions of the brain—and by
nothing else. And yet what shocks the organ has
to withstand! —dipsomania (no insult intended), in-
herited epilepsy, inherited something worse, over-
work, worry, broken banks, religion and despair.
All these conditions and many others are liable to
produce the states known as ghost-seeing and
clairvoyancy (or, shall we call it theosophy ?), and
that they do not more often do so is very greatly
to the credit of the brain.
No, it takes a good deal to upset the equanimity
of the normal brain. Personally, I never saw
ghosts, or did even a little bit of clairvoyancy, till
a few months ago. And this is how it came
about :
I have had Gulf-fever, smallpox, typhoid, and
various other ailments in my lifetime, but they
came without any special circumstances and went
away without visions. It happened, however,
last year, that I was located in a certain
township, a typical little southern farming town-
ship. There is little need to describe it, they are
all the same—one long street with a few miserable
four-feet high sugar-gums struggling to thrive
amidst the utter weariness of their surroundings,
four churches, two melancholy pubs., and a deso-
late institute without a front (the effort to erect
half the building having exhausted the inhabitants
for all time), a pious Baptist storekeeper, who
rooks you with a placid air of admitting
you to the Kingdom of Heaven, and a
fat-facecj, miller, who is King (with a large
K, please) of the place. It is always a
fat-faced miller who is king in these smug southern
townships, as the pot-bellied publican is in
the more jovial northern ones. There was
nothing but dvdl, grim, sordid “ respecta-
bility.” And I was there twelve months,
and that was how I came to see ghosts. The work
was hard, but the people were harder, and between
them they broke me down. The grey molecules
began to flutter about and bump against one
another, and when it comes to that a man had
better look out.
One night I lay down, determined not to get up
aiy more. A big balloon was swelling and
swelling, trying to burst me open and get outside,
a bar of iron was crushing on my head, trying to
break its way inside, and someone must have
accidentally dropped a sack of the fat-faced
miller’s flour on my feet, and put a patent
stove under the bed. I was cautious, and lay
quite still on my back, for I said to myself :
“If I move, something must go, the balloon will
either come out or the bar of iron go in, and then
lam done.” So I did not move all night. As
the hours passed on, I got cold, so cold, the sack
had apparently rolled off my feet, leaving them
numbed where the weight had been, the tension
gave way gradually, only the bar of iron was still
working away to get at the brain. Gradually a
feeling of almost ease came over me, although I
could hardly breathe, and I said to myself then :
“ This is death.”
As George Meredith says, “ If this is death it is
not hard to bear.” 1 can understand now how it
is that in illness so few fear death. I have often
seen and wondered at it. Now I have felt and
can understand it. The lull in the storm, which
has been at work in the human organism, which
precedes the state of final unconsciousness, is
accompanied by an almost delicious languor
of the senses. Christian and Atheist alike
experience this, and then it is that both,
as a rule, die peacefully.
It is at very early dawn that the vital force is
at its lowest ebb. It is then, more often than at
any other time, that the creeping, subtle decay of
the organism, which we call death, finds least
resistance to its powers. As the hours went on,
with finger on the gradually weakening pulse, I
waited ; but presently the grey light of day came
through the window and the beats of the head
came gradually a little stronger. Life had so far
conquered.
Night came again. The violence of the attack
had spent itself and left a state of dull lethargy
with the brain enchanted, yet too active for sleep,
the little grey molecules had been too profoundly
excited for that. Now mind, I was absolutely
in my right senses without the least tendency to
the state known as delirium. Two or three
hours of the night had passed when, opening
my eyes, which I had closed to shut out the light
of the burning log-fire, I saw, sitting on either
side of it, two intimate friends, who were at that
time some thousand miles distant. There they
sat, in familiar attitudes, evidently conversing,
although I could not hear what they said, and
quite oblivious of the fact that they had not seen
me for twelve months. After watching for some
time, to make sure I was not dreaming, I sat up,
addressing one of them by name, but they had
vanished. The next night they were again there,
and then night after night, for two or three hours
before dawn, my room was peopled with some few
familiar and unfamiliar forms—attendant demons,
I suppose, a latter-day Theosophist would call
them. One night, on opening my eyes, I distinctly
saw, sitting by my bedside, a lady dressed
entirely in black, who was a complete stranger
to me' She looked at me gravely for some
time, and then rose to go, and I noticed then
what I had not observed before, that she had a
little child with her. As she went towards the
door, I watched her curiously and noticed that she
did not open it but moved through it quite in the
approved fashion. I remember that I had suffi-
cient presence of mind to reflect that it would be
of no use for me to try to get up and lock it after
that.
But one night, or, rather, early morning, I
found myself not in my own room but in a certain
little club that I ouce had wotted of. My spirit
had been projected on an astral plane. It was
very real and very familiar. Sanders was sitting
on the billiard-table waiting in vain for a hundred
up, M'Carthy had got a stranger into a corner to
make a little bit with, and the postmaster was
helping himself to a three-finger nip. I cou'd hear
their conversation distinctly, and even converse
with them, and yet, all the while, I had a curious
sensation that, bodily, I was still at home, and
that, when the time came to shut up, they would
have to go and nob I. I had even made a bet
witli McCarthy on the matter, and then I looked
round and saw my own room again, and I was
lying in bed with the toy fire still burning, and,
with a feeling of satisfaction that I had won the
bet, I fell asleep. I woke up with a desire for
beef-tea and champagne and, I think, whisky,
and then I went to sleep again. When I next
awoke I wanted poached eggs on toast and more
whisky, and the spirits fled howling into the
desert. With sleep came the desire for food and
drink, the little grey molecules settled themselves
down to rest and I have never been troubled with
visions or clairvoyancy since.
The curious fact is, for I made enquiries, that
they actually were at the club that night as
I had seen them. It is true they were there most
nights—but that is not to the point. They had
no recollection of my presence amongst them, and
M'Carthy had the meanness to repudiate the
wager, which, after all, was only to be expected
of him.
Yes, friend “Dipso.,” one must be ill, and
very ill, to see ghosts or to be a clairvoyant. I
would say to you, should you ever feel that way
inclined, “Go look at those portraits of Mr.
Stead’s that I mentioned before and —take a liver-
pill.”—George Dant.

CANCER OF THE LIP-
Agonizing: torture relieved, Disease Cured.
“ I am 55 years of age, and until 1384 had al-
ways enjoyed good health. About that t mo, a
little hard bunch, like a wart, appeared on my
lower lip. Finally, the bunch gathered, broke,
and formed a sore ; then it began to eat into the
flesh. The Cancer —for that is what the doctors
finally called it—kept getting worse and worse,
year after year. It caused me great pain and
uneasiness. During the last year, I would wake
twenty times in a night, suffering intensely
from twitching pains. It was as if my flesh
was being lorn from me by pinchers, bit by bit.
m
At last, I began to take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
In the course of a week or two I noticed a
decided improvement. The twitching and the
pains were very much less, and the sore began
to look healthier. In three months my lip
began to heal, and, after using the Sarsaparilla
for six months, the last trace of the Cancer dis-
appeared, and left very little scar.”—J. E. Nich-

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I was as one who treads the seaside sands
In all the restlessness of discontent,
Who feels within his breast a soul impent,
That longs to spread its wings in unknown lands ;
Whose heart goes out with each white sprite that
flies
To dip its wings within the radiant morn,
But paces to and fro fore’er forlorn,
Or stands and turns to sea his wistful eyes ;
As one who trims his sail to catch the breeze
That rolls the clamr’ous main in fitful sleep
And ventures forth, expectant, on the deep
Beyond the travail of the furthest seas ;
Who comes to be at last a soul that drifts
In lone, wild ways where winds and waters war,
And growls the thunder, and the torn seas roar—
As one, ongulphed, who swims, but, sinking, lifts
A drowning cry, unheard of ship or shore.

Last Friday the Australian Joint Stock Bank
peacefully dosed Its doors. This, with the Commercial
of Australia and E.S. and A.C., makes three big collapses
Inside of seventeen days. The three deceased institutions
nod an immense amount of unpaid capital, but—like the
federal not one of them made any effort to raise money
by levying a call on the shareholders, so, for all practical
purposes, they might as well have had no unpaid capital at
a “- Probably, if they had ma !e the attempt, two of them
couldn’t have got the coin in time in any case, but the
memorable fact is that the attempt wasn’t made. Also—
which is a-ulost astonishing circumstance—they didn’t
even wait until their available coin was exhausted before
closing the big front doors in despair. They all had cash
enough on hard to stand a run for some time longer, and,
for all th°y knew to the contrary, the run might have
died away entirely before their funds were used up, and
left them to go on and flourish for another century. Also,
they were all apparently solvent, so that no one could have
been any the worse, and both the shareholders and
depositors might have been a great deal the better, if they
had hung on to the last and taken the chance of a revival.
But apparently there was no grit in any of them, and they
doubled up like a moist dish-cloth almost at the first sign
of trouble. The E.S. and A.U, which was the most
remarkable of them all, closed its doors with half-a-million
golden sovereigns still in hand, and the A.J.S. seems to
have given up hope after a two days’ scrimmage with its
depositors. The Bulletin’s fixed' opinion is that the
board of directors which collapses so promptly and so
miserably isn’t fit to be called a hoard, and is hardly any-
thing more than a cigarette-paper. Also, it is noteworthy
that the Commercial of Australia had something like one
year and nine months’ notice of the wrath to come ; the
run on it was not sudden enough to be called a run—it
was only a crawl. It began away back in ’9l, and the
institution which can’t get a few of its assets realised for
an emergency which arrives so gradually as that hasn’t
enough foresight to understand that to-morrow will be
the second day after yesterda3 r . To sum the thing up, it
wodld seeni that the A.J.S. burst because the run upon
it was sudden, and the Commercial caved in because the
run on it was not sudden, and the E.S. and A.C. failed
because it was too tired to bring its money up from the
cellar and pay it out.
• # #
The only one in the crowd that made anything
like a decent resistance was the Federal, which kept going
until its shares were almost being given away on the
market. And even it, with reasonable energy, might
possibly have lasted three months longer, and in three
months a great many possibilities, and even a few im-
possibilities, ma3' come to pass. When anybody starts a
new bank, or re-organises an old one, the first item of the
articles of association should be a solemn assertion that
the institution will keep going so long as it has coin
enough in the safe to meet the last cheque that has been
dumped down on the counter. A bank lives on bluff, and
the bank which won t bluff to the bitter end is doomed
find born dead.
• • #
. The awful ignominy of the Australian Joint
Stock Bank’s collapse grows worse with each succeeding
revelation. The latest addition to the story is that there
were large funds available at the London branch, but the
Sidney directors did not even cable for assistance. The
whole situation is wonderful. The A.J.S. was in existence
and prosperous for 40 years; its shares were at a large
premium; there was hardly a suspicion as to its solvency
(though people would like to see its big station-
accounts overhauled by the Auditor-General and staff;
it had still much gold in its strong-room, and a lot of
money at its London office to be had for the asking;
it could, presumably, have got assistance from the
other banks, or from the Government if it had wanted—
and yet it burst after a two da3’s’ run, seemingly for mere
cussedness. If the directors were not men of most
excellent character and all absolutely above sus-
picion, the natural inference would be that the bank
was being ridden for a collapse in the share-market.
As things stand, the assumption is that the A.J.S. was
run by a crowd of old ladies. It was the first purely
Australian bank in N.S. Wales, and its fall leaves a
horrible impression that the Australian hasn’t enough
pluck to run a bank.
• * •
The course of N S.W. legislation is always
upside-down; Dibbs “recognises,” in a general sort of
way, that there oujht to be some State supervision over
the banks-some better guarantee, for instance, that they
haven’t twice as many notes in circulation as they assert
they have, that their alleged “cash reserve” is really in
existence, that there is some semblance of security to
note holders, that the alleged “deposits” do not consist
largely of money borrowed from another bank to make a
show on balancing-day, and so on. But, meanwhile. Par-
liament wants to adjourn, and there is not time to deal
with the matter; there is onty time enough to rush
through a frantic Act, making things worse than they are,
and the other thing must stand over.
• # •
The A.J.S. bank-directors say right out that
they applied for help to the other banks and were refused.
But they don’t say how much they asked for. The
amount demanded was, it is said, regarded as ridiculous
and as an evidence that the A.J.S. didn’t seriously think
of going on.
* * •
It is a somewhat amusing spectacle—Dibbs,
the politician who is himself being re - constructed,
rising up to save the “ rocky ” banks. If only Dibbs
had given himself the power to issue inconvertible
paper-money when he began to get into a tight place,
what a difference it would have made in his position 1
His assets, according to his own sworn statement, exceed
his liabilities.
• » •
There is such a thing as having too much
advertisement, and the much-printed story about how
the managers of the Bank of N.S. Wales and the Com-
mercial of Sydney consulted with Premier Dibbs as to the
best means of allaying the financial panic is a case in
point. The natural inference is that the Union, and the
’Asia, and the New Zealand, which don’t appear to have
been represented at the Conference, didn’t care a straw
for the trouble. As a matter of fact, their representatives
plainly showed that they didn’t care, and behaved with
aggravating flippancy right through the whole business.
# # ' *
Premier Dibbs’s promise, made to allay panic,
that no more N.S.W. banks will be allowed to suspend, is
much the same as a promise that no corpse will be allowed
to be buried, in order to stop a pestilence.
• * •
It is interesting to read in the daily papers
telegram after telegram setting forth, as an evidence of
“confidence,” that “there have been no withdrawals ”
from the various smashed banks at all sorts of remote
places. Considering that nobody gets a chance to with-
draw, this sort of thing seems superfluous. There have
been no withdrawals, so far as The Bulletin is aware,
from the Westof England Bank of late, but, all the same,
that institution remains just as dead as it was twelve long
years ago. This statement may look irrelevant, out it
isn’t.
# * #
The announcement of the A.J.S. Bank on the
morning after suspension that the doors would be open to
receive deposits on trust account, gave two old Sydney
gentlemen apoplexy.
# # •
What is “reconstruction?” A coat of white-
wash?
• * •
The Sydney Safe Deposit Co. has now let most
of its space. It is stated that one man has made it the
receptacle for 32,000 golden sovereigns, which he took out
of the bank. It is averred that W. H. Paling has the sole
rights of a new German process, enabling him to grow
gold on safe-deposited sovereigns at the rate of about 12J
per cent, per annum ; but this is probably a lie.
• * •
The Union Bank, with plenty cash in hand,
looked calmly and grimly on during the bank panic. The
Union can’t be rushed by English depositors during a
scare. It does not in England accept callable deposits,
but merely takes the public cash in exchange for its
debentures, which are redeemable by the bank on notice,
but irredeemable so far as the depositor is concerned.
The debenture-holder gets his interest regularly; if he
wants his principal he has to sell his debentures on the
market. The Bank of Australasia, regarded by bankers
as being in an unchallengeable position, also sssumed a
most independent tone during the trouble.
The Bank of New Zealand, which weht through
its financial ordeal a few years ago and has much benefited
by the experience ( apropos , the Assets Co. which took
over a lot of its then umneltable securities has proved an
excellent venture) was untroubled by the panic. It didn’t
lose £lOO in gold on the Friday, being regarded as quite
outside the storm. On the contrary, it has picked up
quite a lot of solid business.
* * #
As we write, the London Chartered has just
closed its doors, “pending reconstruction.” Yet, despite
all these things, there is at least as much money in the
shares of some of the busted banks as in those that
still keep afloat. If the bank doesn’t reconstruct, the
buyer’s coin is lost; if it does reconstruct—and the
Commercial, at all events, seems to have managed it suc-
cessfully—there is probably an ultimate profit, on the
existing panic prices, of 1000 per cent. And the man who
puts his money in a N.S.W. gold mine has seventy times
as much chance of losing it, with no 1000 per cent, in
prospect.
* * «
The Bulletin has always advised its readers
to be depositors instead of bank shareholders. The return
is not much greater in the latter case, and, in time of
panic, shareholders must go to the wall until depositors
are satisfied.
* » «
Melb. Age publishes the drivellings of a Mr.
Crispo on the advisability of forming a “Bank Insurance
Co.” One of Crispo’s valuable ideas is that “a few
scoundrels” caused the Commercial Bank shares to fall,
“so that they might purchase the shares at a cheap rate.”
In that case, why didn't the scoundrels purchase them at
a cheap rate ?

for young people, aged from 15 to 19 years. The
lowest age hitherto quoted has been 20, and persons
under that age have been called upon to pay the
rate chargeable at 20. Now, however, they will enjoy
the full benefit of their youth, and we have little doubt
the concession will result in a great number of young
people effecting policies under these tables, which,
after all, are the really true life-assurance tables. A lad
of 15 can now effect a policy for £6OO for £2 os. sd. a
quarter or £7 17s. lid. a year, and there can, therefore, be
little excuse now why any such should remain uninsured.

The 48th annual report and balance-sheet of the
New York Life_ Insurance Co. appears in this issue.
According to this document the total assets of the Co. are
now over £28,000,000, and its surplus of assets over all
liabilities is £3,457,808 ss. Id. This is the largest surplus
held by any mutual life insurance office on earth. The
annual income of the New York Co. is now £6,365,553;
it has 224,000 policies in force, and the amount insured is
over £141,000,000. During the' last year its assets have
increased by more than £2,300,000, and its surplus by
£342,371. The balance-sheet is certified to by the State
Government of New York, and this Co. claims to hold
the latest certificate issued by the Department, showing
all was well with it up to a very recent date.

Four years ago, Mt. Lyell, Tasmania, was un-
successfully hawked about Sydney. It is now going to
boom, not necessarily so much on account of its richness
as by reason of the crowd connected with it. Mr. Knox,
ex-secretary of the big Barrier mine, goes to England to
float it. Dr. Peters, probably the leading copper-expert
of America, has praised it, and already the Financial
News says that there are many enquiries in London.
But even the Hill crowd are not infallible. They
blundered at Te Aroha, where their expert manager spent
upwards of £lOO,OOO, with the result of failure and
liquidation. Nothing they touch fails from the want of
cash, however. Hitherto want of money has been Mt.
Lyell’s drawback. It will now be thoroughly tested by
the best of modern machinery under capable management.

For long the world’s deepest gold-mine was the
Magdala, now known as the Magdala-cum-Moonlight
(Stawell, Vic.) In their anxiety to win approbation by
deep-sinking, the old co. left the only known payable ore-
body at the 1400 ft. level, the aim being to strike the dip of
bodits of quartz worked by other local mines. The ore is
now running 10 to 12 dwts.

Sylvester Brown, ex-member and mining warden
for Broken Hill, made a good deal in the purchase of
Bayley’s reward claim (W.A.) Purchase money, £6OOO
and one-sixth share; result of first 300 tons, £lO,OOO
worth of gold. It is said that several of the prominent
Broken Hill men are in it.
• • •
Nothing very definite has been published re the
operations of the Delegate (N.S. W.) Sluicing Co., but the
writer hears that the first clean-up has been so good that
the nozzles were shifted on to another part of the pro-
perty. J. S. Reid, at one time the largest shareholder on
the Broken Hill register, is the leading spirit in the con-
cern, on which upwards of £50,000 has been spent.
* • #
Two things only are working against the success
of the huge lottery land-distributions offered in Mel-
bourne—the want of money and the want of confidence in
the drawing of prizes. The noble public, remembering the
status occupied a year or two ago by lots of people now in
or on the way to gaol, is inclined to trust nobody.

Manager Howell, of Broken Hill Proprietary,
Is likely to make a huge fortune out of his slag steam-

One of the most prosperous little companies of
Queensland is the Biggendert gold and bismuth mine,
Maryborough district. During the last half-year it paid
£2250 dividends, while the stock of Unsold "bismuth in
London is valued at £9OOO.
* * #
Bismuth is absolutely controlled by a ring, and
its quoted market price is no guarantee whatever
of the price obtainable in Australia. A rich patch
of bismuth combined with silver was sent to Eng-
land last year. Its value was estimated on market rates,
but the returns were bitterly disappointing to the
workers. If the price of bismuth were regulated by the
supply, it would fall over 50 per cent., when probably new
uses would be found for the metal. As it is, to find
bismuth in N.S.W. is not difficult, but to get a market
outside the ring is practically impossible.

The first Nova Scotian quartz battery stands as a
memorial in Halifax public gardens. Where is the first
N.S.W. or Victorian battery ? In which province was the
first Australian battery erected ? As Australia is the
world’s greatest gold country, its first battery should be
an object of interest. The writer invites correspondence
on this subject.
• • *
The writer is not given to jumping to the con-
clusion that every new crushing process is going to
supersede the old stamp battery. Yet he is now prepared
to say that what appears to be the best roller or ball
crushing mill yet introduced is that known in Australia
as the this ore-crusher. Briefly, it is a six-segr..ent drum
lined with plates. Inside this drum are placed some 30
loose steel balls, varying from .3 to 5 inches dia. These,
by the.'revolution of the drum, roll over and against each
others The outer fine screen is protected by an inner
Bte«> «*ot screen, and the action of the crusher is such
thakVp'e tbs finely-powdered ore passes through, that
too (•’-•■* ’■* returned to the balls for further grinding.
Amaqp** jii takes place outside. Its capacity is greater
per horsepower than any other roller mill; wear and tear
is slight; there is less comparative weight; and the cost
of erection is small. It is a patent of Germany, where
over 1000 are in use. One is working on the Homeward
Bound mine, Yalwall (N.S.W.), the managing director of
which gives it a big lift by saying: “ Hope shortly to have
such arrangements made as will enable me to have 10 or
more of these mills at work here, in addition to over 50
head of stamps.”

The Johnson’s Reef, North Johnson’s and Rose
of Denmark are adjoining Bendigo claims out of which
tons of gold have been won. The very deep ground of the
Rose is about to be worked through the North Johnson’s
shaft. Further North is the Princess Dagmar, another
big dividend mine ; next comes the Golden Age, where
the ground is much trodden and the gold, so far, not so
rich. Several claims South of the Johnson’s reef were
fabulously rich in the shallow workings a quarter century
back, although, so far, the deeper ground has been
unprofitable. Patient prospecting, however, often gets
its reward on Bendigo.

An advertisement the other day in the Age for a

One of the biggest law-actions of the age now
proceeds in America. The officers of the West Consoli-
dated Virginia and California Mining Co. are sued by
O. C. Steele, for concealing a silver bonanza until they
had squeezed out the smaller shareholders, of whom Steele
was one.
# # *
Something of the sort is generally known to
have occurred at Broken Hill, where men “ in the swim ”
got in at shillings and out at pounds. The writer knows
of a Bendigo mine, where the striking of a rich reef was
kept dark, and an alleged machinery accident gave the
manager and co. time to buy a van-load of scrip. The
trick played on the Barrier was not altogether dissimilar.
# . . # #
The U.S. mining papers publish lists of dividend
and non-dividend paying mines, and, as a rule, there is
no striking difference in their respective lengths. The
writer imagines the ghastly difference if similar lists were
published of N.S.W. mines. The old alluvial fields of
Lambing Flat, Ironbarks, Wattle Flat, Tambaroora, Gul-
gong, &c., were as famous as those of Victoria, and much
richer than the Queensland alluvial, but where now are
the hopes they engendered of permanently rich reefs?
# # #
Australia produces a little more gold than the
U.S., which is second on the list. South Africa is already
third. Then ’comes Russia. South Africa threatens
shortly to take the lead.

The silver output of the United States last year
was 58 million doilai s : Australia, 13£ millions.

The Randt (S. Africa) March output was
93,3520 z., a big falling-off on the previous month’s, but
still enormous compared with any other of the world’s
fields. The drop is attributed chiefly to the floods.
* * *
The biggest of the Randt mines, however, kept
■up their average last month, ahd the next in the order
of cakes show a material improvement. Here are some
of the March gold cakes: Robinson, 7364 tons, 11,2360 z. ;
Langlaagt Estate, 16,269 tons, 82130 Z;; Crown Reef, 9067
tons, 65610 z.

The A. A. Co. was the first to work coal in a big
way in Australia. Their first lease covered 2000 acres,
and contained the monstrously greedy condition that
no other Co. should be allowed to work coal in the New-
castle diitrict during their tenure of 31 ytars. The Co.
enjoyed the monopoly for some years, but under the
force of public opinion they gave up the condition.
Nevertheless, they have had already a long life of unin-
terrupted dividends.

The New Hargreaves Mine, N.S.W., pops up
again ; this time, not with a display of rich gold in Sydney
windows, but a one-ton crushing from a dyke put
through the Austral Otis crusher for 21dwts. gold. This
is an excellent return so far as it goes, but it is no
indication of the bulk value of a big dyke.
# * #
The Red Rock Mine, N.S.W., has been taken
up again by two men who propose to erect a ten-head
battery thereon. It was floated in the boom on a scale of
grandeur and extravagance, which the mine could not
possibly stand. Tens of thousands were spent on special
trains, champagne, making splendid roads, shafts and
tunnels, and on machinery. It is about three miles from
the main road from Tenterlield to Drake, and at one time
you could find your way by the empty bottles along the
track. Now, it is intended to work the mine in sober
earnest.
* * *
Manly Council is considering in real earnest
Aid. Scarr’s proposal for a municipal ferry-service. It is
reckoned that three up-to-date steamers could be built
and s t joing for £30,000. The Council, monopolising
its own wharf, would get at a single stroke all the regular
trade, and as the new concern would not he burdened (as
in the case of the rival P.J.SiS. Co.) with interest on a lot
of useless and non-central wharf-sites, etc., bought to eiu-
bastion a monopoly, the scheme should be a successful
one. The local tradespeople, however, appear to he some-
what in favour of a public wharf and free competition.
This would lie all very well for holiday-times, no doubt;
but it is obvious that any plan for securing regular and
comfortable communication must he based on a monopoly
of the central wharf. There appear to he two local fac-
tions on the Manly steam-service question—one set of
people who want to make the place a quiet, genteel
residential suburb, and another set whose idea is to bring
’Arry and Hemma down in droves at 3d. r o,, rrn to
patronise the tea-and-cake shops.

Who are the inapirers of the continuous
attempt to boom Westralia? The settled parts of that
wretched country consists of mere freckles of fairly
good land-a few acrtstoeach freckle—amid millions of
acres of sandy waste. Industrial genius and the future
may work miracUs with it, hut the present prophecy is
that, given another 18 months, by the end of which time
the last of the borrowed money will have been expended,
W.A. will he a howling desolation, out of the tailings of
which only the unspeakable Chinaman will he able to
make tucker. And that state of things will, failing an
intermediate political revolution, he used as an excuse to
import cheaper and still cheaper slaves under the pre-
tence of “saving the country.” The W.A. goldfields
might pay in any other Australian province, Where pro-
visions can be obtained at something under famine prices,
hut the average ounce of gold won there costs £6 before
it can be sold for (say) £4.

money. He replied: “No: the Government guarantee

hut then look at the sort of Government they are.” But,
seriously, the two big public savings-banks should be
amalgamated, so that both may he under a permanent
Government guarantee, and the masses may know
that when they deposit their money they have as security
all the assets of the State and all the honest forces of

That which is sensationally rich in mining fij

Gawler, situated on one of the hills close to Adelaide.

and passed out of remembrance until its history was

THE BEST
BEVERAGE
FOR
CHILDREN
Absolutely fure.
CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and vigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.
Mrs. Stapleton No. 2.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The deceased Mrs. Staph ton had been always
noted as slightly the better horse of the team, and
I am afraid matters were not improved by some of
Stapleton’s wild and unthinking friends, who,
because he became pot-valiant in his cups, would
seduce him into that condition and then send him
home to defy the late Mrs. Stapleton.
Unfortunately, these outbreaks of bravado
always resulted in Stapleton’s protracted seclusion
from the public gaze. Cuts and bruises don’t
easily heal on the man who “ nips.”
To everyone’s astonishment, however, Stapleton
took the loss greatly to heart. He shunned com-
pany, went about in deep mourning, and vowed
that his heart was buried in his wife’s grave.
It was at this period that he met that
interesting little widow, Mrs. Beausant, who
had buried her husband and her heart just about
the time when Mrs. Stapleton died. There was a
good deal of sympathy between them, and they
entertained one another with long eulogiums on
the respective dears-departed. They even went
in company to the respective cemeteries, and each
complimented the other on the taste displayed in
the matter of tombstones. Death is a weird thing.
Love is weirder still.
“ Had my darling but survived me,” said
Stapleton, “ this is exactly the stone I should
have dreamt of her selecting ” —indicating the
ponderous block of marble which held down the
remains of the defunct Beausant.
“And,” said the little widow, as they gazed at
the tomb of the gone-before Mrs. Stapleton, “if
my angel had lived to bury me, this is just the
tribute he would have paid to his.”
Such a mingling of tears could lead but to one
result. They agreed to 'Comfort each other, and
proceeded to do so.
The marriage promised to turn out happily, and
Stapleton soon resumed his former habits and
became a jolly dog once more. One midnight he
reached nome in a state of obfuscation ; so con-
fused was he that next morninar he remembered
nothing about his arrival. However, there he
was in his own bed “ with a head on him.”
He crept out, went over to the glass, and
examined his face. Not a mark on ic! Mrs.
Stapleton, No. 2, had not served him as had been
the wont of Mrs. Stapleton, No. 1. He slipped
into bed again, just as his wife appeared.
“Well, ducky,” she said. “How’s its little
head this morning?”
“Good gracious !” thought Stapleton, “ What
a lucky dog lam ! I must take advantage of this.
No weakness, now,” he groaned, dismally.
“ Could you get me some brandy and soda, cold,
old girl? Selina (No. 1) always had some ready for
me.”
Now, the fact was, that Selina used not only to
give him no cold soda and brandy—but she used
to bang him soundly and take away his clothes, so
that he could not go out to get any.
“Yes, lovey,” said the model No. 2 ; “he shall
have it iced and she left the room.
Stapleton almost capered about in anticipation
of the glorious times he would have with such an
obedient spouse.
Little No. 2 came oack with some brandy and
iced soda ; then she brought him in an appetising
breakfast of devilled kidney, hot toast and strong
tea, and after he had consumed it and taken a
tub, he felt a new man. How much better this
was than being locked up with yesterday’s paper
and a black-eye 1
“No weakness,” he murmured to himself. “ I
must keep this up; ” and I regret to say that he
did. Instead of showing his gratitude for such a
jewel of a wife by trying to reform, he seemed to
consider that he had taken out a license for bad
behaviour.
Mrs. Stapleton No. 2 was a plump, pleasing
little woman of about six-or-seven and twenty,
who never showed that she possessed any temper
at all, despite the airs Stapleton now began to
assume—for there is no worse tyrant than your
emancipated slave. One evening he got home
early, and, on entering the drawing-room, found
his wife just bidding farewell to,a good-looking
middle-aged man, who, without taking the
slightest notice of him, put his arm round Mrs.
Stapleton’s waist and gave her several hearty
kisses, to which she made no objection. The
utter coolness of the proceeding so paralysed the
husband that he did not find voice for anything
but a half-choked yell of rage ere the stranger had
left the house. Then his wife turned to him and
smilingly remarked ; “ What a nice man Captain
Johnson is, I do love him so !”
The yell now broke forth in dead earnest.
“You wretched woman !” he shouted, dancing
about the room, “How dare you! Leave my
house !”
* ‘ Why, Charley, what’s the matter ?” she cried,
in mock surprise.
“ What’s the matter ? A man kisses her before
my face and she asks me what’s the matter ? ”
“Why, Charley, surely you don’t mind that.
Beausant didn’t mind it.”
“Beausant didn’t mind men kissing you before
his face !”
“No, not if they liked itshe returned, blush-
ing coyly.
“ Not if they liked it! ” he sneered. “ And I
suppose they often liked it ? ”
“Yes, I am afraid they did.”
“ And how often has Captain Johnson been to
see you, madam ? ”
“O! only sometimes when you’ve left me
alone.”
“ And ” (sarcastically) “ anybody else ?*’
“Just a few nice fellows.”
Stapleton shook his fist wildly and plunged for
his hat.
“Charley,” she cried “ what is the matter?
Poor Beausant never found fault with me. O you
are cruel! ” and she shed a few bitter tears.
“ Madam, I am going to consult my lawyer.”
“But, Charley dear, dinner will be ready
directly, and —he’s left his office by this time.”
The door banged behind Stapleton, and the
next moment he was nerving himself for the ordeal
by draining a bumper of Dutch courage. It did
him good, and he tried another. Then a friend
came in and they took a drink together; other
potations followed, and Stapleton began to bemoan
his fate and vow he would never go home again.
But he did ; he got home somehow and awoke
with at least three heads on him. Nobody came
near him now ; there was no brandy and cold
soda. He called the servant and asked after his
wife. She had gone out. Where ? To the races.
This was a staggerer. It was nearly 11 o’clock ;
he would get up and see about it. He dressed
and descended. The girl brought him some
breakfast —cold mutton and weak tea ! Ugh ! he
put on his hat and went out. This time he did go
to the lawyer’s—but the lawyer, he found, had
likewise gone to the races.
Stapleton passed a sad day, and when Mrs. S.
came home at nearly seven o’clock, radiant and
smiling, he was fairly boiling with wrath.
“Well. Charley.” she said. “ I had a splendid
day. I hope Mary looked after you properly !”
“ Mary did not look after me properly. I have
had a most miserable headache all day. Your
heartless conduct .”
“Not at all, Charley—yesterday’s whisky, and
no little wifey to doctor him up as Selina used
to do.”
“ Selina, madam, knew how to behave herself.
She did not allow men to kiss her.”
The trouble was that no man would have cared
to kiss Selina.
Mrs. Stapleton laughed. “ Charley, a fair thing
is a fair thing. I’ve tried to act up to the memory
of the departed Selina. Why can’t you imitate
the lamented Beausant?”
“ Because ! because ! Because I won’t—there !”
“Then I won’t nurse you up any more when
you take too much overnight.”
The worm had turned.
“You’d better make a bargain, and if you pro-
mise to be a good boy in future, I won’t let any
fresh men kiss me,” she continued.
“ I’ll take care of that, madam, or at least my
lawyer will.”
Mrs. Stapleton laughed gaily. “ Now, Charlie,
behave yourself for the future, and I’ll do the
same. Not that I’ve done anything very dreadful
yet, for Captain Johnson —as I called him —is my
brother Dick from up-country, who’s been here to
meet you several times, but you were always out
with your friends, getting—well, drunk. He was
in the house once when you came home, but you
had taken too much whisky to see him.”
Stapleton is now as reformed a character as

“ A little Buxomity,” is how a novelist in-

A horrible rumour is afloat that a trousered
woman has bloomered in Melbourne.
The novel, “ Chidiock Tichbourne,” by
Marcus Clarke, now being published by an
eminent London firm, is not a first edition;
it was printed a couple of decades ago in the
old Australian Journal. It is distinctly in-
ferior to “ His Natural Life,” in treatment and
interest—in fact it would not be taken to be by the
same hand.
Cabled that a German Lloyds’ boat has
reached Bremen from Australia with 60 emigrants
aboard who couldn’t get work here. When the
Germans, the “ Chinese of Europe,” can’t get
work, who can ? Apropos, the current passenger-
lists of the White Star Line hence to the Cape of
Good Hope do not encourage the “ Advance Aus-
tralia ” idea. Last month the Australasian cleared
with a full list for the Cape, and the other day
the Damascus did likewise. Not saloon people on
a pleasure-trip, but third-class passengers anxious
to get away from the stagnancy, hopelessness, and
generally cloudy outlook that now pervades every
avenue of enterprise in this continent. Nor are
these people all “stone-broke” paupers; many
are careful folks who have made a little money,
but see no safe opening for it here. In a word,
the class Australia can least afford to lose.

Life on an Ocean Liner
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There was no luck on that ship. The captain
was at loggerheads with the chief officer. The
second mate was the captain’s spy. The third
mate was obtrusively “ pious.*’ The fourth mate
backed up the first mate. The sailors shared
these emotions. So bitter was the feeling that I
am sure one would have liked to see the steamer go
to pieces during the other’s watch.
The first saloon snubbed the second saloon. To
show their contempt, the latter chummed in with
the steerage passengers. As we outnumbered the
others three to one, renegades of sympathy were
well paid. In fact, emissaries carried cold fowl to
those of the third class who smiled on the A 1
batch. The ship continued on her way.
To beguile the weary hours, the steerage gave a
grand concert, all hands being invited. The deck
was decorated with flags, the electric-light was
turned on, forms were brought at the captain’s
order, and a goodly muster gathered. In the
middle of the performance, one of the saloon
people came forward to sing. He was immediately
hissed. Turning round he emphasised the facts
that only snakes and geese could make such
sounds, and declared himself off. The programme
was nearly finished, when some one said, “Let
Bill sing.” Others vehemently protested.
At last Bill was allowed to sing. Now, Bill
was a Lancashire collier, and he sang a song
that the honest fellow had learned among his
hewing mates. It contained only one word, and
that really meaningless, to which any exception
might be taken, yet one after another of the
stately visitors, male and female, promptly arose
and fled. If they showed their good taste they
also betrayed their wonderful knowledge of voca-
bulary.
There was a socialist lecturer on board. He
advertised a sermon on “Death.” The audience
was large and appreciative. A sailor was jawing
away during the whole oration, yet, at its con-
clusion, an individual named Jones lay down in a
corner and solemnly died. It is believed whisky
and contempt accelerated his end.
A newspaper was started. The artist was
a criminal flying from justice. The editor
had paralysed legs, and at dinner one day the
artist, perhaps in ignorance, said to him : “ Take
your confounded legs out of that! ” He failed to
obey. The command was reiterated. Then the
editor asked to be tied to a stanchion until he had
bruised his enemy. This settled the paper.
There were whist-parties, with arranged signals
destined to be betrayed. There was a Salvationist
officer looking like a mangled yellow blind, a Bul-
letin ex-pressman, a motley crowd of women
selected by chance indeed, a clown, three or four
consumptives, and a phalanx of liars. One case
of delirium tremens occurred, and one fireman
rebelled. The doctor got mashed on a Spanish
girl returning from a trip to Sydney, The ladies
generally slept from 5 to 12 a.m.
We arrived at Suez at 2 a.m. The electric-light
had been fixed for use in the canal. Suddenly, at
that hour, the sun was turned on. It revealed

Jimmy: A City Sketch.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As the subject of a jingle that is nothing—only
true,
You perceive I introduce him by his Christian
name to you.
And they always called mim “Jimmy”: for a
person of his size,
In his own expressive language, he was “ pretty
free from flies.”
He was small, and lean, and bitter, with bright
eyes like heads of pins,
And the pock-marks on his features were as many
as his sins ;
He was working when I met him—though he
wasn’t oner-fond
Of that labour which is holy—for his living in a
bond.
He was working in the cellar, and, I’m sorry to
admit,
That the devil which is liquor reigned pre-eminent
in it.
But a bond that isn't noted for the drinking that
is done
“ On the sly ” and “ under cover ” doesn’t happen
to be run.
Why, they take it raw with breakfast when the
dew is on the roof,
And they take it from the barrel and the “octave”
overproof;
It is beer about eleven if the locker’s not about,
And at twelve, if you require it, well, the cellar-
man will “shout.”
When the store is closed for dinner, if you feel a
trifle “ on,”
Take a drop of good, bulk whisky with your bread
and cheese at one.
Should you want a maraschino, or a claret, or a
hock,
Go and whisper to the storeman and he'll see about
the “shock.”
After three, you’d like a brandy—ah ! a muffled
sort of sound
From the tapping of a “ quarter ” shortly comes
from underground,
For the cellerman is careful; and a “ boss,” who
knows the ropes,
If that muffled peal were louder, might destroy
your budding hopes.
Still he finds he can’t prevent it, and, in time, he
doesn’t try,
Though you drink—from ancient custom—mostly
always, on the sly.
If they catch a storeman boozy, that is, lying on
his back,
“ Gone to glory” by a hogshead, well, perhaps he
gets the sack.
But the storeman who has graded can imbibe
from morn till night,
And defy the whole creation to pronounce him
truly “tight! ”
You will take your glass of liquor and enjoy
it, I’m afraid,
With a secret satisfaction that it is not “duty
paid,”
For he calculates the duty, docs the docker, on
“regauge,”
And, of course, he makes allowance for the loss in
bulk —through age.!
Yes, the boozer’s fairest haven on this side the
golden shore
Is a decent boss and wages in a Customs’ Bonded
Store.
Now, the Bond, that isn’t noted for at least one
man of fame
In the art of sober drinking, is an everlasting
shame;
And the hero of this ditty, though they matched
~ him with the best, .
Never left his man, nor lost him, till he left him
~ ~w ‘ t b tbe blest.
No, there never was a gauger, or a locker, or a
■, ■

You had but to find him willing, in his own
T , peculiar way, . ~
If y° u "’anted mformation-to be written up
. I s ? me l da i s f , . . ~. ~
And he d tell you breathless stories of the times
w . tha . t used to be, . ~ a
When he sailed aboard a whaler in the South
? ea >, , .. . , .
Gf a life that had attractions—of its many ups
w . and downs, ...... ,
When his heroes went a-roving in the ships of
„ Bobby ’ Towns.
He would babble of the “blackbirds,” and the
schooners, and the crews,
Which were fitted out as slavers, and he’d follow
with his views
On the brown Kanaka women and the landing on
the beach,
Now for love and now for profit, now, perhaps, a
spice of each.
He would speak of wild carouses on the long-
expected pay,
When the whalers lay at anchor at the head of
Mossman’s Bay.
Then he d pour another mugful, and, with some-
TT thing like a sigh
He would dram a soft rememb’rance to the good
oM days gone by. .
With the cobwebbed casks around him in the
cellar’s musty light,
He was less a living being than a small embodied
B P rite -
He had drifted to his corner—like the most of all
his breed —
He had dried ! instead of dying there —had
withered like a weed.
In that gloom where Jimmy tallied casks and
quarter-casks in rows,
There were rats of unknown sizes, there were
colonies of those
Most voracious little rodents, such as once in
Hlamelin town
Caused the people so much worry till a piper piped
them down—
If that piper was a Scotch one, I could easily, I
think,
Give a reason why they followed him to rolling
Weser’s brink.
Now, the rats of which I’m writing were as daring
and as bold
As those rats o’er which the W eser, in the good old
legend, rolled,
And my hero used to catch them in his traps—set
overnight,
Pour some “overproof ” upon them and then—set
the lot alight !
Then around the squealing rodents—living, leap-
ing balls of flame —
Jimmy would perform a war-dance, very quaint
and queer the same.
I had chanced on such an orgie—that was how I
got to know
All about my subject’s weakness, and its sure
effect, if slow.
It was early in the morning, I remember rather
well,
And he prayed me till I promised 1 , on conditions,
not to tell, •
For his “missus’’! sake (he beat her) and his
poverty and age.
But I’d slightly studied science, and I put away
the caye!
And I kept an eye on Jimmy, though I must
confess I found
That you cannot trust a whaler when he’s working
underground.
Well, they had a fire that summer and the owners
never knew
How the conflagration started, but I fancy that I
do.
For they found him in the cellar, or, perhaps, i
ought to say,
What was left of him to find there, when the fire
had had its way.
And they gathered up the cinders, and the parson
spoke of “crowns,”
But I do not think they’d fit him, that relict of
“ Bobby ” Towns. . ,
Yet, it isn’t in the fashion, and in any case it s
mean
To be hard upon a person that you understand
So, his sallow, ferret features, and his eyes as
sharp as pins,
May the Lord deliver Jimmy and forgive him all
his sins.
Sydney, March 1893,
EDWIN J. BRADY.
Warned in Vain.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Royston, manager of one of the branch banks in
Blankford, sat in his room alone. Apparently
doing nothing, in reality racking his brains with
thoughts which seemed to revolve in an endless
circle out of which there was no escape. He was
in a desperate fix out of which there was but one
way—the last road taken by a cornered man.
Blankford was a mining-town just in the fever
stage, Royston had been speculating, and the
inspector was duo almost immediately. In fact, a
wire from a chum had warned him that he was on
the road.
The question that most persistently hammered
itself into his head as harshly, monotonously, and
regularly as the din of the stampers, was how to
gain time.
Surely some of his ships must shortly come
home and save him from disgrace and—he pulled
open the drawer in front of him and looked at the
bank revolver. No, not yet, that resource was for
the very last Meantime something might turn
up.
Something did turn up.
There was a hasty knock at his door, and a man
entered in answer to his summons. The visitor
was flushed and nervous. He might have been in
bed the night before, but if sc he had not slept
much. He looked hunted.
He took a chair without ceremony and sat down
on the opposite side of the table. The bank-
manager and he had been schoolfellows.
“Ben!” he commenced imploringly. “I’ve
had to come to you. I’m stumped, clean-stumped,
and I must raise the wind somehow to-day.”
Royston, who had quite recovered his self-
command, glanced at his distressed face com-
passionately. He could feel for him.
“You know, old man, I would help you if I
could ; but I can’t do it personally, and I daren’t
do it on behalf of the bank. You’ve run through
a cool three thousand during the last eighteen
months, and it’s simply gone into the hands of
thieves and women.”
“ I know, I know. But a correct, cold-blooded
fellow like you, a man with every impulse under
restraint, cannot possibly allow for a man built as
I am.”
“Then, from a cold-blooded point of view, I
should be only making you a means of gorging a
few more blood-suckers, if 1 possibly give you the
money you want.’'
“No. I don’t think so. I feel somehow con-
fident I shall win to-night ” —Royston smiled —
“ Yes, laugh, but I am confident that by this time
to-morrow my troubles will all be over.”
Royston was silent.
“Can you let me have some?” went on the
other nervously.
“Now, what security can you possibly offer
that I could strain my conscience to accept?”
“ The last and only thing I have left.” And he
placed some papers on the table.
Royston opened them and laughed.
“You have them left, Allen, because nobody
would lend you a sixpence on shares in a sink.
1 The Fiery Rose !’ why you wouldn’t have the
cheek to ask anybody but an old friend like me.”
“That’s God’s truth,” returned the other, “ but
they are not quite worthless.”
“Worse than worthless. And you know it as
well as I do.”
Allen got up, walked to the window and looked
out. Royston sat thinking. Supposing by some
trick of fate this spendthrift, gambling fool won !
Won enough to lend him something to tide him
over in his turn. Such wonderful turns of luck
had occurred before. Besides, he was in so deep
now that it did not much matter what he had to
account for. It would all come to one reckoning.
“ Allen,” he said, “ I will try and help you per-
sonally, but it will pretty well cripple me, and you
must promise me, swear to me, one thing.”
Allen nodded, he could not speak.
“ If you win you must help me to-morrow if I
want it, even to the full amount of your winnings,
and you will never bet nor gamble again.”
“ I swear to both,” said Allen holding out his
hand. “I had better leave this with you,” he
said indicating the scrip.
“ Yes, if you promise to take it back if you win.
You can make it over to me personally, not to the
bank. Richards will witness the transfer.” The
ledger-keeper was called in and the business soon
concluded.
“ What can he want money for to-morrow?”
mused Allen as he departed. “I suppose the
good old beggar wants to keep it for me out of
harm’s way.”
Royston went through his business with out-
ward calm. In fact, to him, a good deal of the
bitterness of discovery had passed. He was
determined not to face it and he felt convinced
that he must take the only way to escape facing
it. There was no light ahead, for the off-chance
of such an unlikely thing happening as Allen
winning anything, his sober reason rejected.
Blankford, as I said before, was just then at fever
heat, and men had all phases of the gambling
mania on them. Royston spent a quiet evening,
and towards ten o’clock he sauntered home.
Before going, however, he went in to where he
expected to find Allen. He was there, sure enough,
and had been winning steadily, and was doing so

then. Royston nodded to him and went out—he
felt that his presence might banish the luck.
He walked home and sat down in his room to do
some work. That finished, he still sat th re
musing, and his thoughts now took another turn.
Why wait for to-morrow, why not have done with
it all to-night? What a mad chance to hang a
rag of hope upon, the winning of some money by
a simpleton who had been the pigeon of every
rook on the place ! He threw himself down on
his bed and tried to sleep, and sleep came. The
wearied brain gave way and for hours the self-
doomed man dreamt, pleasant, delusive dreams of
peace and fortune.
Some one was knocking at the door. He started
up, wide-awake, iu an instant. It was broad day-
light. He went to the door and opened it.
Richards, the ledger-keeper, stood there. He
stared at Royston’s haggard face in surprise. “I
thought you must be sick,” he said, “as you
didn’t turn up at the hotel to breakfast. Are you
ill? Yogrlook like it.”
“I amS bit seedy. Couldn’t sleep and dropped
off just at daylight. I’ll he out directly.”
Royston washed himself and arranged his dress;
then he went out to go over to the hotel where
he took his meals.
“ You II hear the news about Allen over there,”
said Richards, as he went through the bank.
“What about him?” asked Royston with a
sudden quick beating of the heart.
“ Shot himself about daylight this morning. I
don’t know the rigtits of it, but I believe he left a
letter for you. The police have got it.
Royston made no reply, then he asked the
apparently meaningless question: “What time
does the coach come in ? ”
“ The same time as usual —about three o’clock.”
“He won’t have got far ahead,” said tho
manager, not knowing that he spoke aloud. He
went on to the hotel, leaving Richards in a state of
amazement.
At the hotel he drank a cup of tea and listened
as one entranced to the details of Allen’s suicide ;
then he went to the police-station—he could not
keep away—to read the hasty scrawl of the dead
man :
A last word for you, old friend. I lost all my winnings,
and God knows what besides. From the time that you
came into the room I lost on every card. Your money is
gone, and I cannot face it. Good bye. The thieves will
get no more out of me.
Royston went back to the batik, and a ghost
went with him, in broad daylight. Doomed,
doomed ; why, it was as plain as possible. As
soon as he went into the room Allen’s luck
vanished. Fate had marked him down, and there
was no reprieve coming in furious haste to save
him.
He went to his room, and got through the
morning somehow. Towards one o’clock there
seemed to be a curious stir in the town, noticeable
to his acutely-sharpened ears. The coach had
probably arrived before its time. Two or three
men came in to the outer bank. He could hear
voices in eager conversation, but could not dis-
tinguish the words. He opened the drawer.
There came a quick step towards his door. It
was Richards coining to tell him that the inspector
had arrived. Ho put the pistol to his head and
pulled the trigger. An impotent snap: there was
one unloaded chamber and he had hit upon it.
Ho dropped the pistol into the drawer and
slammed it in as the door opened.
“Just fancy, Mr. Royston, they’ve struck it
wonderfully heavy in the Fiery Rose—a regular
Homeward Bound.”
And so they had : the first 60 tons of a three-
foot reef gave 540 ounces.
The Inspector did not arrive for two days, and
when he did, everything was in apple-pie order—
so much so that he did not hesitate in recommend-
ing Royston’s application for a month’s leave.
Three years afterwards, the following telegram
from a Far Northern town appeared in a Sydney
paper:—
Mr. B. Royston, manager of the Australian Bank, com-
mitted suicide yesterday by shooting himself through the
head. It is rumoured that a considerable sum of money
is unaccounted for.
Warned in vain.

The Orphan.
Many of the children of aristocratic families in England
rarely, if ever, see their parents—so engrossing are the
demands of a fashionable life. -Londox Truth.
“ The sweet little lass is an orphan (I fancy you
said),
The father is ne’er to be seen, and therefore the
father is dead ?”
“No! no ! her papa’s at the Club. He moves in
a brilliant sphere,
And therefore he seldom is seen by the side of the
little one here.”
“ The sweet little lass is an orphan (I fancy you
said),
The mother is not to be seen, and therefore the
mother is dead ?”
“No !no! In a dainty boudoir—at a mirror she’s
spending the day :
She’s patting the dearest pet poodle and passing
the morning away.”
“An orphan ? Absurd ! her papa is the lord of
this stately domain ;
She has seen him herself once or twice, and
perhaps she may see him again ;
And the heart of mamma may yet melt in an out-
burst of motherly passion—
And the daughter may catch a caress—when the
poodles are no more in fashion.”
Q-
P. LUFTIG.
“ The charity of the poor to the poor is
boundless as the ocean.”
William Tivendale shot Michael Kelly at j
Malvern, Vic., on Easter Monday, for singing a '
song. The papers say Tivendale was arrested, i
but we believe Kelly got away.

duce crime—poverty, wealth, or ignorance?” “Or
Woman ?" —who is at the bottom of all things.
Among Judge E. Rockwood Hoar’s dis-
likes was one for Wehdell Philips. On the day
the great orator’s remains were borne to the tomb,
some one met the Judge, and inquired: “Aren’t

"THE BULLETIN.'
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
It the only pa/per which has a consistent and dia
tinctive Australian National Policy.
Ehe Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.—The cheap

cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or

A new Parliamentary System—one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum. i
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility,”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratio
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains>
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some 1
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for nigh-olass printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of nationa
progress : it is the forceful summons to * the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, ana privilege —the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clauns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin’ is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in -the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
