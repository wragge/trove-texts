Her role as “The Maid of the Mountains’’
is particularly arduous, but Miss Moncrieff
maintains her physical perfection with the
assistance of a good tonic, as the following
letter shows:-
“Messrs. Clements Tonic, Ltd., (
“Heavy temperamental endurance, with
climatic changes on innumerable tours,

good tonic. I must confess at times I have
been dubious in believing that proprietary
medicines would bring about a complete
improvement to an overstrained nerve

“However, 1 am pleased to inform
you that, through the recent good
use of Clements Tonic, all my
doubts have been dispelled, and I
have found that your Tonic has
proved a benefaction to my health.
“Yours faithfully,
Irrespective of your occupation in

course of CLEMENTS TONIC;
it is not a panacea for alt ills,

The Red Page
Rhapsody on a Broomstick
If there is one encomium more than
another that I have always thought in the
highest degree enviable it is that saying of
Stella’s in reference to Swift’s literary style:
We all know that the Dean could write
beautifully about a broomstick.” I should
be supremely content to have incised on my
tombstone: “ Here lies Adrian Lawlor, a
Scribe who could Write Beautifully about a
Broomsticti. — li.I.B.” And to qualify my-
self for the arresting epitaph, let my sen-
tences now be long, straight and smoothly
turned, as befits the subject.
But, on second thoughts, no. One does
not write such sentences in this Twentieth
Century. Or, if one does, no editor will
print them ; readers, he will say, are in too
great a hurry to pay heed to Fine Writing.
Alas! I was long used to the withering
glare that accompanied these dispiriting
words. And as I tucked my rejected copy
into the tail of tny coat I used to wonder
why he wasted printer’s ink upon such
mercurial skimmers, who should be content,
one would have thought, with quintessential
headlines above yawning, empty columns.
Yet wasn’t he always at pains to blacken
every available inch with linotype?
The fact is, we so frequently hear it
asserted, that time is too valuable to be
wasted on any kind of "form” nowadays
that we have come to regard opr more exact-
ing forefathers—sticklers for style and given
to fashioning orotund phrases in the ob-
servance of ceremony—as mere irresponsible
squanderers of their apportioned heritage of
minutes. Worse even than that: we de-
nounce them (on this score) as hollow
poseurs and windbags; and in their writings
we discover on every page a shameless dis-
play of verbiage for its own empty sake:
here a welter of satiating redundance, there
a careering riot of polysyllabic inexactitudes
in terminology, everywhere orgies of tepid
slush, padding and pretentious claptrap.
And since _ we have as little time for their
Fine Writing as for the idea that inspirec
it —the idea that one must in all circum
stances comport himself as a Fine Gentle
man—we assume with a self-satisfied dogma
tism that it is a matter for general congratu
lation that the idea and its expression liav
both long since been put “in the discard.
A good riddance, too!” is the headlong uni -
versal chorus.
Let me say af once that my own voice, a';
any rate, will never join in these ensemble
of denunciation. Nothing that has pleased
my green years shall provoke the frown of
my ag.e, however hopelessly sere and yellow
and I hereby swear that Fine Writing is
still fine for me. The rankest eloquence
does not scare me (except, of course, when
it is spouted impromptu in my face), nor do
I shrink from reading purple passages of
even fhe deepest dye. I admire the sound-
ing phrase, the massive architectonics of the
Corinthian manner. I find Sir William
Temple not too urbane, nor Dr. Jbhnson—
great unread Prince of Prose! —too stately
for my taste. I delight more in the cloud-
capt towers and campaniles of language that
rear themselves from “The Stones of Venice”
than in such a monument of reinforced and
concrete dulness as that “Autobiography,”
for example, of Herbert Spencer. I wander,
a reverent Haj-pilgrim, from oasis to oasis
m the doughty prose of “Arabia Deserta.”
Where style is, in short, there am I, a rapt
and often a solitary devotee.
But at this juncture J sense the growing
fret -of your impatience. Waiving the sub-
ject of broomsticks (for what, after all, is
a subject?) you thrust forward eager to
inform me that literary style, as the crafty,
unobtrusive means to an end, was never
properly mastered until our own day. You
tell me. that the swift flight of a character-
istic ,shaft of Shaw’s carries with- it the
supremest effort of style, and hits its mark
With the directest possible force and pre-
cision. And you point to the immortal Pre-
faces and “The Sanity of Art” and ask me,
“Wfcat is Fine Writing beside such a prose
as that? And why,” I hear you indignantly
proceed, “become a dust-breathing ghoul
among the unthinkable remains of Johnson,
or dig up the thoroughly dead Temple, or
distufk the spirit of Iiuskin, who was little
better than a hollow sham even in the flesh,
when' there are twenty such grave and bril-
liant living souls as D. H. Lawrence, James
Joyce, Maxim Gorki, H. L. Mencken and
Henry Lawson, all superbly equipped to in
terpret life for us in the light of contem
porary experience? And, anyway, who th
blazes,” you sum up—awkwardly splittin
an infinitive in your excitement—“wants t
nowadays read an author for the sake of hi
style? (live us a book with guts in it:,
and leave Fine Writing to school ma’ams
Fine Writing doesn’t butter any parsnips !’
Granted.: < And while you are about it with
your truisms you may as well repeat (fo
the salutary discouragement of flamboyant
Literary Youth) that it doesn’t buy the
baby a new frock, neither. But I see my
hour is already fast running out and no :
a dozen words written yet about that broom
stick! The resentful shades of Swift and
Stella hover steeply above me and pour
ghostly disdain upon the dwindled ardor
thatfgjowed so crescently whenas I typed that
flaunting title a while ago. It is plain that
I shall accomplish nothing here, after all,
but ,a mere preface or fumbling prolego-
mena to the ambitious task that I have set
myself. Some other time, perhaps!
Let my remaining few minutes bear the
burden, of a word or two of unflinching re-
capitulation. Fine Writing, by which I
mean a prose imaginatively, richly, flam-
boyantly, and, therefore, unfashionably con-
ceived, is so abhorrent to the prevailing
taste that the splendid anachronistic lan-
guage of no less a genius than Doughty actu-
ally strikes a pert, though representative
contemporary critic as an “uncouth and out-
landish lingo.*’ Tut, tut! Surely nobody at
this 4‘time of day needs to be told that
Doughty—who published his superb “Arabia
Deserta" in the 'seventies, I think—is the
last stylist in the sunreme English manner:
a of Browne. Donne. Taylor and the
six or seven others who have tuned the
tongue of our race to the sublimest purposes
lof prose. When it is of this quality, I will
maintain till the latter end of my life and
with my latest breath and my last dying
kick that there is more sincerity (not to
speak of dignity) in Fine Writing than in
all the curt and affected nonchalance of the
fashionable jargon that the public buys for
prose at 9s. per vol. Let me inform you
that Barrie, belike rather unseasonably, saVs
that “the beginning and the end
ture is to open the mind to beautiful
thoughts.” “How very . trite!” you mur-
mur. But isn’t this naive dictum really a
bit of a paradox these days? Paradox or
platitude, be assured that the Barries always
know what they are talking about. W’hereas
the Menckens do not.
ADRIAN LAWLOR.
A Theory of Race Ideals
In the mythology of almost every civilised
race there is a tradition of a time when
men lived longer, felt more intensely and
Remove sweetly than was possible in
the historical age that preserved the tradi-
tion. I his does not prove that in earlier
years there really were greater poets, patri-
archs ot longer life and finer friends, lovers
and patriots; but it does prove that those
were the former ideals. What people once
desired, their children dreamt of as pos-
sessed. Few myths are in themselves records
or tact; the value of each lies in the setting.
It preserves the mode of life and the manner
ot thought of those who first told it. Thus
the stories of the Greek demigods may have
only the faintest hipt of truth ; but' we know
ti 0111 them the shape of. a house ,in the ‘
Homeric age, the kind of occupations in
which a king then engaged, and the'oblique
moral view of those kings and their follow-
ers who regarded lying as a fine art and
numan sacrifice as a possible means of pro-
pitiating the gods.
But the tradition of longevity, poetry and
passionate living is far older than Homer—
tar older, in fact, than the alleged dates
0 j aD xi a ju . ous events, save, the wars of the
gods themselves; and by means of this tradi-
tion it is possible to make a good guess at
the nature of European life. Archaeologists
have reconstructed the scene; tradition sup-
plies the spirit.
Europe, in the period just beyond the rim
ot history, lived in mud houses or wooden
dwellings erected on piles at the margins of
shallow lakes; and over it the word “Bar-
barian is written in large letters both bv
the ages that immediately followed and bv
the scientific investigation of our own time,
xet it had nearly all the ordinary conveni-
ences of life as they are known to those
civilised people to-day whose homes are a
tew miles froni the larger centres of Popula-
tion. Among the bronze articles dug up from
that remote period are hairpins, clasps
combs, knives, needles, tweezers, bodkins
cups, plates, bowls, tiepins, rings, hair-orna-
ments, collar-studs and brooches, as well as
axes, daggers and swords. Most of these
articles were much more finely worked than
those in use to-day. We are also quite cer-
tain that people then wore woven garments,
cultivated three or four sorts of grain had
most of the domestic animals, knew some-
j i .drawing and decorative art and
delighted in sports and games of which horse-
racing was one and chess another. Yet thev
lived m mud houses. y
. r -^ e a ges that immediately followed built
m stone and organised themselves into em-
pires; and it has been inferred that the
stone buildings and larger organisations re-
presented an advance. Yet is it not con-
ceivable that the person in the mud house
really went back in the more essential things
when he began to build in stone? Many
houses in Australia are built of adobe, and
many in the southern part of Maoriland of
sun-dried bricks—good, substantial buildings
cool in summer and warm in winter and often
large ana handsome. Would anyone be fool-
ish enough to say that the people who live
in them are in any human sense inferior
to their friends who live in brick or stone?
let it is exactly what the modern investi-
gator is continually saying. Nor is the
accomplishment of a people in handicrafts
any sure guide to their mental height. In
the very primitive society, where life was
largely a fear and its bright spots were re-
presented by food, human thought may have
turned almost entirely on improving physi-
cal conditions. That this is not so when
society advances to moderate comfort we
have ample evidence. Men are content to
leave their homes as they are and increase
their cultivations, to sell or exchange their
products without considering much the
further improvement of those products The
ambitious person in a trading age does not
desire to improve his mode of living so much
as he desires to increase his possessions.
Now consider _ that the mud houses of
Europe with their moderate bronze-age com-
tart—-good clothing, good food, warmth, rea-
sonable security and permanence—lasted
without any very noticeable change for pro-
bably not less than five thousand years. We
are forced to ask what was the natural
r th ™ e ? er S ies of the people who
lived then. Irade was hardly in existence-
the markets were few and small; light labor
and easy hunting supplied all their simple
needs. We are brought back to the ideas-
supplied by the earliest myth—that they
lived longer, felt more intensely and sang
better. Ihe longer life and more intense
feeling are passive things; the singing is
i ie oldest European thought
which has been preserved song and science
are one, so that under singing we must
group philosophy, knowledge and art. This
in its turn forces us to the very curious
conclusion that the early development of
Europe was spiritual—using the term in a
decent sense—rather than physical, that at
some definite point, now unknown, the Euro-
pean race turned back to the physical—to
yar and conquest, to stone houses and stone
despotisms. This may or may not have been
ai ? ...advance; but the knowledge leaves us
with the comparative certainty that the key
of our race is to be found in its primitive

Citroen Record
ROYAL AUTOMOBILE
CLUB’S RELIABILITY TOUR-
ING CONTEST—APRIL 1,1922.
Citroen secures highest score.
Ist place. 100 points gained.
138 miles on 2 gallons 7 pints of
petrol, or over 48 miles to the
gallon.
The above contest is but one more proof of
the Citroen’s right to the title “The World’s
Economy Car.” The more scientific design
of the Citroen has resulted in a car of simpler
construction, longer life and greater efficiency.
The use of Citroen double helical gears in
the transmission is an exclusive feature that
does away with all clashing and knocking of
gears, ensures silent running and practically
eliminates wear in this important part.
But to appreciate the many distinctive features
of the Citroen, of which the above is but one,
requires a personal examination.

PINKETTES
FOR SICK HEADACHE
Most people suffer at regular
intervals from sick-headache. The
trouble is caused by accumulation
of poison in the digestive organs
and this poison produces nausea
and the headache follows.
These distressing attacks may
be avoided. Pinkettes are dainty
little sugar-coated ovals that act
so gently that they are the ideal
laxative to use in correcting a
tendency to sick headache. They
have no unpleasant effect to make
them objectionable to the extra-
sensitive sick-headache patient.
Old-fashioned harsh purgatives
will not do at all in such cases.

My love is the wind on a great hill
Bending the bushes and blowing the grass;
My love is the ’air grown softly still
When all winds pass.
My love is the last star of the night,
Floating in shallows of saffron sky;
My love is the wild, sweet light
Of the sun, morning high.
My love is a tall, grave queen
Moving in royal and splendid state;
My love is all that the roses mean
Nodding over the gate.
My love is the wisdom of all the seven
Silences set in the heart of a man;
My love is a song blown out of Heaven
On the day God began.

Reincarnation.
I love the opalescent summer eves,
When sunsets linger goldenly and long,
Like the last splendid chords of some old
song,
Tender and passionate, that music weaves.
The perfumed darkness glows, and one by
one
In pageantry the planets slowly roll;
And truth seems near, drawing the wistful
soul
Far from the loom on which life’s threads
are spun.
And what is Space, and what are we with
Time ?
Our hearts have throbbed and thrilled a
myriad years,
One with the stars, and with the pale
moon’s tears,
Potential atoms, one with the Sublime.
We may have wandered in old Memphis,
when
The eagle Queen Nitocris’ sandal stole,
Dropping it in the king’s own jewelled
bowl,
Or viewed the rites of Horus and Amen.
Perchance you were, as now, my dearest
friend,
The dawn-star o’er your beautiful young
face,
My hair entwined within your soft embrace,
Learning to love unto a perfect end.
The violet hills slope upward fold on fold;
Below, the verdurous velvet of the vale.
A little while, and we shall end our tale,
And crystallise into a nobler mould.
Sunlight and raindrops rule the world of
flowers;
We love, we laugh, then flutter to our
rest, ,
As lisping leaves borne on the i,epny, s
breast, _
Where Death is not, only new Life is ours.

I Have Heard Singing.
I have heard singing in the night
Like music poured beneath the stars,
While flashed the mystic silver light
Of swords and scimitars.
Across the city’s grey repose
Slow-marched an endless, ghostly throng,
And to the listening stars uprose
Their mighty battle-song,
Ascending unto Heaven’s bar
With wondrous sound and full accord ;
Where keep the angels tried iri war
The vigil of the Lord.
I have heard singing in the night
Of hosts returning, battle-worn —
The song of conquerors in the fight
Upon the night-wind borne.
An anthem glorious and vast
As sing the seas in tempests dread,
And like an echo came at last
The chorus of the dead ;
Proclaiming they who died while life
Held them in sweet and gracious thrall
Content lay in the dust of strife,
And craved no fairer pall.
I have heard singing in the night
Of martyred myriads who died,
And, dying, gave undying might
To dreamings sanctified ;
Of those who steered a fragile bark,
Dauntless, upon a restless stream,
And followed through the friendless dark
A star’s elusive beam.
I have heard singing in the night
That rose and filled the starry space,
And flowed, as flows the sun’s clear light,
In loveliness and grace.
O happy ones whose song superb
Attains unbroken harmony!
Theiv is no bitterness to curb
That splendid ecstasy:
The few who trod a sunlit road,
Where flowers were sweet and songbirds
chimed,
And they who at ambition’s goad
To high achievement climbed !
I have heard singing in the night.
Nor loud nor joyous was the strain,
Still holding at its noble height
The poignancy of pain.
Then to a murmur faintly found
Sank battle-hymn and triumph-song,
And like a river rolled the sound
Resistlessly along—
The voice of those who lived and strove
Unfaltering in murk or gleam,
Whose song of sacrifice and love
Is of all songs supreme.

THE HOME OF YOUR DREAMS
You have often dreamed of every modern conveni-
ence for your home. You have thought how wonderful
it would be to do away with the nuisance of smelly oil
lamps and have a soft, dependable electric light at the
snap of a switch.
How cheerful and attractive that home would be!
You have pictured all the modern labor-saving
appliances—how the electric-iron would save many
steps and assure a cool kitchen on ironing day—running
water in the house; an electric washing machine to do
away with the back-aching labor of the old wash-tub and
rubbing-board. You have seen other houses kept clean
and healthful with little effort by the electric cleaner.
Now you can realise this dream.
THE G.E. HOME LIGHT AND POWER UNIT
is the medium which brings to you the many conveniences
of electric service.
“Electric service for every home —no matter
where you live.”

MODERN TIMES AND ANCIENT
DAWS.
Last week, during a row between rival
churchmen, the question of sedition was
dragged in. The disputant of the first part
defied his opponent to risk a journey to
Maoriland, since there they know better than
in Australia how to handle persons who cast
aspersions on the past of the Lloyd George
Government. The challenge implied an
admiration for the archaic Maoriland atti-
tude on such matters which is oddly out of
place in a modern community. The statute
books of the Empire are full of laws —mostly
of religious origin—which, though unre-
pealed, are treated as dead by a generation
that has lost in superstition and gained in
freedom. Under an Act of William 111.
anyone who, having been brought up as a
Christian, questions the existence of the
Deity or the truth of the Christian religion,
“by writing, printing, teaching or advised
speaking,” is liable to imprisonment. Since
this enactment, if enforced, would have re-
sulted at any time during the past century
in the gaoling of some of the nation’s most
luminous intellects, it has been allowed for
the most part to remain in abeyance. As a
matter of fact, anyone who teaches doctrines
in reference to the Scriptures or the Book
of Common Prayer which are calculated to
in any way wound the feelings of believers
is similarly liable. —in strict law. If it were
operative such sincere preachers as Canon
Barnes, who recently in England denied the
infallibility of the Bible, and that Sydney
Presbyterian minister who told his theolo-
gical class that Genesis was inaccurate,
would become felons. So a compromise has
been arrived at, and is pretty generally fol-
lowed. An ex-Anglican may turn Mahom-
etan without fear of legal consequences: he
may repudiate the Bible and cast verbal
scorn on the faith of his fathers. Not unless
he advocates some move such as the propa-
gation of his new faith by violence—not,
that is, till he threatens to invade the Com-
mon Law rights of others —is he likely to
encounter trouble.
* * * *
The laws directed at sedition derive from
the Blasphemy Laws. When they were
passed it was as flagitious to criticise the
King as to deny the Creator. By an obvi-
ous process of logic, the King soon came to
mean everyone and every institution by
whose help he maintained his power. In
strict law it is, therefore, sedition, and a
serious crime, to comment adversely on the
action of any Government (it will be remem-
bered that W. M. Hughes, while still flushed
with the exercise of his powers under the
War Precautions Act, threatened to prosecute
a critic who had done no more than criticise
Hughesism) ; it is sedition to do what Mr.
Hughes himself has often done, viz., gibe
at the Constitution and urge that it should
be scrapped ; it is sedition to bring into con-
tempt any House of Parliament (the Aus-
tralian ..Senate.,,for §xaro.n]e«-which has been
the butt of the Sydney and Melbourne press
for years) ; and it is sedition to do what is
done with equal freedom in the Melbourne
Club and in Macdonell House, Sydney—viz.,
preach class warfare. In short, sedition is
any libel on authority. But party govern-
ment is for good or evil nothing else but
government by libel and slander. Every
political party relies on a certain amount of
lying misrepresentation and abuse to gain
office, and when it gets there the Opposition,
employs the same methods, in the House and
elsewhere, to reach the Treasury benches.
It would have been very convenient for the
Lloyd George administration, during most
of last year, if English Liberals and their
newspapers had been confined to the letter of
the law in respect of seditious utterances
on (say) the Irish issue. They were
not. It is in such matters that freedom-
loving Britain differs from places like Maori-
land. Thirteen months ago Major Arciier-
Shee, a Tory, urged in the House of Com-
mons that the sedition laws should be en-
forced against speakers in Hyde Park who
made a practice of bringing the Government
into contempt. The reply of Mr. Siiortt,
K.C., the Home stated in a few
words the British practice in such cases.
“Many seditious, abusive and revolutionary
speeches are reported by the police,” he said,
“and provided that no breach of the peace is
caused, and the speeches do not advocate
direct violence, there is no need to deal with
them. The custom is to regard Hyde Tark
to some extent as a safety valve.” That was
the sensible attitude of a British Executive
at a time when it was facing such a storm
of abuse, aimed by men of all classes and
all parties, as has never been known in the
history of Australian Governments. And it
is a traditional capacity to think coolly
and with such tolerance that has earned
for the British their reputation for self-
government, and has kept them free of
revolution at periods when larger sections
of Europe were in chaos.
* « * *
If any considerable proportion of Austra-
lians desire to follow the lead of Maoriland
and revive the laws against sedition insofar
as criticisms of existing Governments are
concerned, they have in W. M. Hughes the
very man to oblige them. Stray truculencies
emitted here and there of late denote that
he has by no means lost the taste for blood
which he acquired during the war years. As
an instance of how the courts stand to the
Executives in such matters it will be remem-
bered that they held here, in Pankiiurst v.
Kiernan, that smashing a window “dimin-
ished the resources of the Empire” and was
punishable accordingly under the Unlawful
Associations Act. It is as certain as any-
thing can be that, if asked to do so, they
would find that 99 per cent, of the Hughes
Government’s critics were guilty, in strict
law, of offences entailing heavy penalties.
The country would thus get back to the con-
ditions of those strangled six years in which
Hughesism carried on immune from all criti-
cism except such as was agreeable to it.
The flow of public opinion would be diverted,
for a time, in whatever direction the Gov-
ernment desired. Many of the old bureaus
would come to life again : for the superfluous
official is own child to stifled criticism. The
informer and the agent provocateur would
flourish at the expense of those who had
been rash enough to speak disparagingly ( i,c
seditiously) of Mr. Hughes and his col-
leagues, Our system of government would
be altered from that which England now
enjoys to something resembling that of Eng-
land before the abolition of the Star Cham-
ber. And since the methods of political
anti-Labor would be adopted by political
Labor —assuming Labor regained office be-
fore a revolution occurred —the only sufferers
in the long run would be the people, irrespec-
tive of class or party. Herbert Spencer
remarked that the Assyrian conqueror who is
shown in bas-reliefs leading his capt’ves
by a cord is bound with that cord himself.
He forfeits liberty who enslaves others. And
it is the same with people who try to en-
slave the free expression of opinion on the
behavior of Governments.. They become un-
free themselves, and b°gin to suffer all the
disabilities which in the world of to-day
descend on those who are content to be en-
chained.
THE CANT OF RECIPROCITY.
Australia may hold a record for back-
wardness among the young nations, being
apparently unable to create a new State, or
open a new port, or start a new city, or
compose a transcontinental railway, or pay off
an old debt, or be honest about a sinking
fund. It may be all this. But no country
has a greater genius for sending out “com-
missioners” of one sort and another to see
how things are done in foreign parts. If
the Dooley Government had lasted, that
mere local authority proposed to send an
expensive agent to investigate “bootlegging”
in the United States. When the folk of
foreign parts see our untutored emissary com-
ing they hasten to entertain him on the
grease and oratory of the land, and try to
rush him into a commercial treaty which is
greatly to their advantage. No commercial
agent has yet returned with any concession
of the least value, but some have returned
possessed by a bemused idea that it would
be very nice if we arranged to “reciprocate”
with some country with which we do a con-
sistently losing trade, and which never recip-
rocates worth a copper. As an instance,
Senator Pearce has returned from Canada,
and reported:—
I had the opportunity of discussing the question
of reciprocal trade arrangements with the Canadian
Government as well as with Chambers of Com-
merce and business men at Ottawa, Toronto and
Montreal. I am convinced that not only is there
a genuine desire on the part of Canada for reciprocal
trade with Australia, but that there are many
things in which a mutual trade could be established
without detriment to the industries of either coun-
try, particularly in those products that are seasonal
in their character.
The chances of machine politics took Peakce
away from his carpentering in 1901, and he
has been a politician ever since. He has
sat in six Cabinets, but never as Treasurer,
Minister for Trade and Customs or Post-
master (there are many accounts to keep
at the Post Office). His department has
until now always been Defence—a purely
spending branch of the Government. “Busi-
ness men at Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal”
naturally pulled the leg of this unsophisti-
cated warrior.
Canada learned its trade habits from the
dollar-bitten United States. The policy of
each country is to be self-supporting, or as
nearly so as circumstances will permit, and
to anm at pre-eminence in agriculture and
manufactures, even if it works long hours in
the effort. The two who are one flesh
believe in selling everything, in order to boom
their own industries; in buying as nearly
as possible nothing, so as not to boom the
other fellow’s rival industries; and in taking
the balance in gold, or in Government securi-
ties if there isn’t enough gold to pay with.
This kind of reciprocity doesn’t work with all
countries, but it impresses the unsophisti-
cated representatives that easy-going, easy-
borrowing Australia sends abroad. Both from
the U.S. and from Canada the itinerant pub-
lic bagman comes back with no gains, but
with a tale of how he was made much of,
and dined, and wined, and cigared, and
caressed, and persuaded that we should give
the plausible host a larger opening here for
his manufactured goods, to the detriment
of our own struggling factories—this in re-
turn for some vague encouriigement for our
“seasonal” products: a few bananas and a
passion-fruit or two. The U.S. and Canada
don’t want our wheat or meat or butter, for
they are sellers of these things themselves.
They don’t want our manufactures either,
if we had any to sell, for they are in the
rare position of being exporters of them
also. Canada sends abroad cheese, eggs,
butter, sheep and cattle (alive and dead),
wheat, flour, oats, hay and fish. Also it
exports coal, copper, silver, agricultural
machinery, manufactures of leather, iron and
steel, wood and paper. It exported ships
and munitions during the war. The U.S.
does the same thing on a vastly larger scale.
And the results, even with the reciprocity
we have, which seems a great deal more
than we can afford, have been as follows so
late as figures s’’e available:—
Australia’s Australia’s Average
iiveiagv; Average Annual
Annual imports Annual Exports Balance
for 20 years for 20 years Against
(1899-1919). (1899-1919). Australia.
United States. . £8,707,543 £4,407,314 £4,300,229
Canada .. ... 799,112 557,850 241,262
The results were worse than they looked, for
the sales weren’t all goods of the kind we
want to dispose of. Some coin and bullion
were included. The averages grew steadily
worse as time went on. For the isolated
year to June, 1.920, where the record stops,
this was the position:—
Year’s Year’s Balance
* Imports. Exports. Against Us.
United States £23,768,030 £11.129,937 £12,638.093
Canada ... . . 2,640,383 312,452 2,327,931
So it becomes an urgent question whether
this country can afford to reciprocate any
more.
* * * *
Australia, being a land with an appalling
foreign interest bill to pay every year, re-
quires to sell much more abroad than it
buys, so that there may be money to its
credit to meet the liability. But it buys far
more from the U.S. and Canada than it sells
them. From the Australian point of view
pur business relations with them are worse
than our relations with any other countries
on our trading list. With increasing energy
—-an energy which is wholly to their credit
—they push their wares on our market. But
they do hardly any counterbalancing benefit
to our agriculture by taking raw materials
in return. Rather—and this is to their
credit too —they want to sell us raw mat-
erials as well. _ Their apparent ambition is
to take Britain’s place in supplying us with
finished articles, and if they succeed Britain
will find it difficult to pay for our raw stuffs,
which will be left on our'hands. At the same
time Canada and the U.S. are the only ones
which persistently bamboozle our unfledged
ambassadors of commerce with proposals for
more business of the one-sided variety. There
is one kind of reciprocity that would meet
all cases, and especially the case of Aus-
tralia, which must sell or burst. It would
consist in enacting that when our purchases
from any outside State in (say) 1923 got
beyond the amount which that State bought
from us in 3922. the receipt of goods from
that State should cease for the rest of the
year. That would save us a lot of money
and would seriously affect only two coun-
tries. They talk reciprocity more than all
others put together, and surely there could
be nothing more reciprocal than this idea—
nothing under the sun.
THE STATUS OF WOMAN AND
THE BIRTHRATE.
Looking back one might almost say that
the status of woman represented the birth-
rate of that time and place in inverse ratio:
that as one was high the other was low.
And again, making a tangent, one might sup-
pose it was the good old economic law of
supply and demand in operation—that over-
production of any commodity causes that
product and its manufacturers to fall in
public esteem. Maybe it has some bearing
on the position, but there are underlying
causes more vital yet. Even in social states
where motherhood was outwardly respected
and lauded there ran an undercurrent of
hypocrisy. The full cradle was good policy;
but the mother was part and parcel of the
nursery, and subordinated accordingly. She
was a child who never attained her majority.
Probably Herbert Spencer put the matter
as tersely as possible when he remarked that
intellectual activity in woman was inhibited
during reproduction periods. Yet when
bright, alert-thinking girls marry and slump
so badly after marriage, all sorts of external
circumstances are blamed rather than fun-
damental law.
All life and life-activities are manifesta-
tions of energy. Unfortunately our indi-
vidual quota of energy is limited. If we
spend so. much energy on this, our expendi-
ture on that must be curtailed. Child-bear-
ing and rearing are a passive physical func-
tion perhaps; but their toll of mental and
physical energy is inexorable. The positive
truth that sex energy may be transformed
into other activities is usually recognised.
That energy potential for other effort and
achievement may become creative energy of
sex is as true. Judged by the sum of showy
achievement, woman has oftener been the
heavy-weighted horse defeated than the light-
weight cantering home. Queen Victoria
goes down in history rather as the mother
of a numerous family than as a ruler with
powers empire-wide. Probably she was
born mediocre of mediocre stock. But the
“numerous family” would have handicapped
even Napoleon if he’d had them. Is it
coincidence that of England’s female majes-
ties the only one to show intelligence that
you’d notice is the childless Elizabeth?
The low ratio of reproductivity among blue-
stockings seems proverbial. In America to-
day among women of higher education and
apparently higher or more energetic intelli-
gence, the birthrate is exceptionally low.
But is it the education or the intelligence
that discourages baby? Rather, the absence
or comparative absence of baby has given
mentality its chance of more diffuse expan-
sion.
But if babies are a handicap to mental
development, the other extreme of celibacy
is not wholly a success either. With most
natures sex starvation represents a weak-
ened driving force and understanding. Pro-
bably the modern small family gives woman
the best opportunity to date to prove the
metal she is made of. The present is an
era unparalleled in history, in that so large
a proportion of civilised women are volun-
tary mothers only. Rebellion does not mark
the apex of suffering, but rather the growth
of forces of resistance. Looked at from
some aspects, one of the most hopeful signs
of the times is the wide, slow strike against
the relentless, life-strangling surge of popu-
lation, hungry, unwanted, unprovided-for,
irresistible; now dragging humanity to the
nether depths in the struggle for existence;
now by stark necessity driving up to heights
hitherto deemed unscaleable.
What women are going to do with this
unique opportunity God perhaps knows. No
one on earth does. That some, mostly of
the moneyed class, have used their freedom
from maternal caves unworthily, prostitut-
ing their talents in orgies of vanity and self-
ishness, proves nothing. The biggest fami-
lies would not hold some to the path of duty.
Some men, relieved of the need to earn their
bread in the sweat of their brows, go
straightway to the dogs. Some go simply
to better and higher work. It still holds
that who has been faithful in small things
may safely be entrusted with greater. The
woman who in other days would have been
the capable and loved mother of 12 need
not always have the dozen tied to her to
keep her soul straight.
“As fast as the slowest horse in the
team ’: that inevitably is the pace at which
the waggon must travel. How the van of
civilisation has been held back by the uneven
yoking of the team! The man pleased
to decry some inferiority of faculty in woman
does not see the irony of the fact he is his
mother’s son, her inheritance his. The
tragedy of the slave wife-chattel many see,
yet have not vision to sense the greater tra-
gedy of man, who, because he held her
dwarfed and bond, lived mateless down the
. ages, the race cursed with the aftermath.
Woman accepts the position man says
he yearns for her to accept. She tunes her
mind to his mind, she half-crazies herself
with decorations to gratify the male eye,
for years half-buries herself in the cradle,
half-stupefies herself in the kitchen; then,
putting her head up into the outer world,
she is met by man with a sneer or a last-
straw sigh of irritation that she hasn’t
kept up with his world —and whatever’s up
with it? Still, even now man in the mass is
not a reasoning creature. Thank God he
is not! Feeling and intuition have been at
least as big a factor in the ascent, of man.
Hence woman is able to pass him on some
routes; and when she is out of sight he
always assumes he has passed her. Man
exhibiting and sharpening his mentality out-
doors, while woman was busy at home with
the life-giving miracle, got swelled head and
put on airs when he came back to the cave
—and hasn’t taken them off since.
Clambering slowly and painfully to her
rightful place beside man in all things, it
seems well —essential even —that she should
discard the galling handicap of excessive
child-bearing, at least of that quota destined
to casual or deliberate infanticide still so
large even in civilised countries; that she
should repudiate the big birth-rates, held so
cheap by man, and shadowed by even more
wasteful and appalling death-rates. The
world suffers much from over-population,
or population spread too thick in places,
which has caused so many wars, and must
cause more. Sparsity of population is only
a relative evil. The fecundity of certain
countries, of lower races particularly, threat-
ens to invade and overwhelm their neighbors.
Politicians there are who call for children
and still more children from white mothers
to offset this. A mad race for population
like competitive building of armaments, and
ending as disastrously !To attain their level
of fecundity would be to attain their level
of retrogression, of morals, of less-worth-
living life. When we had attained it we
would be well nigh equal, with little to fight
for. It is their standard that must be raised
to make them safe neighbors. It cannot be
done with their birth-rate and their woman-
status what it is.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Never a Farm without a Mortgage.
The common or garden or loan politician
has two conceptions of Australia. He uses
them as the need arises. In one of his
moods this is a wonderful and jewelled land,
full to the brim of unlimited natural re-
sources, and so rich that it is possible to
borrow on the security of the worst acre of
it and a sin not to. In the other mood this
home of ours is so barren and wretched that
people can’t be expected to come and buy or
accept farms here unless they are bribed to
do so—with loan money, of course. Trying
his best to be in both places at once, the
versatile Prime Minister has made an an-
nouncement
An agreement has been reached between the
Imperial, Commonwealth and Westralian Govern-
ments for the raising of a large loan to settle the
immigrants on Crown lands. Each party will |>ay
one-third of the interest. The extent of the borrow-
ing has not yet been definitely decided on. At
present the arrangement is confined to Westralia,
but other States may participate if they accept the
conditions laid down.
Quite likely other States will participate,
partly through force of habit —the most hab-
itual habit this country possesses—and partly
because, as they must help to pay the inte?-est
as members of the Commonwealth, they
would grudge to see all the benefit, if any,
go to one big partner. The amount of the loan
is not yet settled, but if it is all that the
lender will lend, it won’t be more, so things
might be worse. Hughes mentioned
£50,000,000. A question may arise whether
it wouldn’t be more decent to wait till the
dust and stench of the loan soldier-settle-
ment was cleared up, and the causes of that
scandalous loss and failure ascertained, be-
fore embarking on another adventure of the
sort; but the haste to borrow over-rides all
other considerations. Another question is
whether it might not be better to drop the
loan racket with all possible thud, and re-
sume the long-discarded free-grant system so
far as desirable British subjects are con-
cerned, with, of course, cast-iron restrictions
against sale within, say, five years and
against the accumulation of big estates. A
few years ago, when desirables still came
here more or less, and paid for soil, such
an idea would have been preposterous. But
now all the land convenient to the five main-
land capitals lias been taken up. Five big-
oted and prejudiced mainland Governments
refuse to make new capitals to be new centres
of attraction so that the old days may re-
turn. And experience shows that nobody
wants to come and settle and pay two income-
taxes on land hundreds of miles from any
port to which .access is permitted ; hundreds
of miles also from any city, for the places
which the settlers of 50 years ago thought
were going to be cities are decayed hamlets.
Therefore Governments of one sort and
another (principally another) took to bor-
rowing £lOOO or more (principally more)
per settler, and by strict attention to muddle,
interference and red tape they spent it all
in putting a man on £4OO worth of land
where he was left bankrupt and not really
settled after all. Th.e money will never be
recovered except in small part, and it would
have been vastly better to have made the
patient a present of the bit of soil. and left
him to work out his own destiny, if he had
one. The bad men would have failed, but
under the policy of loans, mortgages and
chronic interference by every fussy and in-
competent Tttomas. Richard and Henky in
office the good men fail also. Still, the crav-
ing to find work and salary and importance
for Thomas, Richard and Henry, and the
yearning to paw over big sums of money,
moves the Federal Cabinet to renew the
busted experiment on a larger scale. The
method doesn’t even produce a modest crop
of taxpayers as the land-grant system would
do.
The Next Referendum.
During the annual conference of the A.N.A.
at Mildura the Hughes Government was
urged by resolution to aim at a Constitu-
tional amendment defining the rights of the
States and reserving the residue for the Com-
monwealth. This pious aspiration is not
likely to be listened to next session when
Mr. Hughes, who is much less a Nation-
alist now than he was when lie called
himself a Laborite, tables his promised pro-
posals for the improvement of our Consti-
tution. Despite his claim last August, after
the High Court’s judgment in the A.S.E.
case, that the Federation now controlled “all
the things that mattered,” it appears that
it does nothing of the sort. It is true
that the employees in any State industry
may, if they think it worth while, come be-
fore the Federal Arbitration Court for a
determination of their wages and working
conditions. But one Arbitration Court is much
the same as another, and neither is likely to
differ greatly in its estimates of industrial
conditions from a competent State tribunal.
So that, though the States may have suffered
a blow to their pride as sovereign bodies,
they are far from being reduced to that con-
dition of “danger and ruin” which the late
Chief Justice Griffith forecasted in the
event of the Commonwealth getting- power to
interfere with their instrumentalities. The
Federal Parliament, on the other hand, is
limited in a very real fashion in directions
in which it would be well for the nation if
it had fuller powers. It cannot pass valid
legislation to standardise insurance, patents
or company laws throughout the States,
though nothing is more fluid than inter-State
trade. Mr. Hughes has just announced the
grant of a Federal subsidy to the meat in-
dustry, rendered necessary in part because,
“as was well known, the most powerful com-
bination in the world dominated the sale
and distribution of beef in Britain and in
the greater the European markets.”
The Meat Trust does not propose to con-
fine its control to meat; its stated intention
is to do -with every article of food wdiat it
has already done as regards beef. Yet the
Commonwealth cannot pass valid anti-Trust
legislation on this matter, which is as much
a national affair as a threatened invasion.
The position is, then, that the Federation
holds powers which it has no desire to see
exercised, while the States hold others which
it is in the interests of all of them to have
exercised by the Federation. What this
means is that, for the first time in the his-
tory of Constitutional referendum campaigns,
the Federal Parliament has something with
which to bargain. The outcome ought to
be a non-party agreement between Federa-
tion and States which, on being put before
the people, as a common ,policy, might well
get an affirmative vote.

Provincialism in Manufactures.
“0.K.”: Every time I nibble a biscuit from
a Melbourne factory, washed down with
a glass of ale from a Victorian (mostly Mel-
bourne) brewery, I am reminded of provin-
cial conspiracies which amount tf> a blight
on the manufacturing possibilities of this
fair land. Also, I wonder whether the early
days of the U.S.A. were marked by similar
checks on competition and restriction of en-
terprise, and whether other young countries
are ruled by the same petty policy that
denies me free choice in biscuits and beer.
Most people are familiar with the name of
at least one great firm of English biscuit-
bakers, for its goods get around wherever
the language—outside America —is spoken.
Every adult in the Empire is aware of the
fame of Bass and Guinness. Not many
people, however, seem to know that the
policy which built up the export trade of
the great British biscuit-manufacturers and
brewers is ruled out in Australia under pre-
sent provincial conditions. Victoria knows
as little of biscuit-bakers of N. S. Wales
as the Mother State knows of the Victorian
bakers. A solemn compact restricts one big
firm from cutting into the trade of the big
firm across the Murray: therefore, neither
of can be expected to turn out such
goods as would be possible to a factory which
had the whole purchasing power of the Com-
monwealth to draw upon. Similar under-
standings prevent one State from ordering
the best beer of an adjoining State from the
local grocer, and, as regards Victoria, at
any rate (I know nothing of beer combines
in N.S.W.),also prevent the excellent beer-
product of a little country brewery from be-
ing marketed in Melbourne or even stocked in
Ballarat. To what extent the localising of
other manufacturing industry is enforced by
conspiratorial agi-eement I cannot say. 1
quote biscuits and beer because they have
long been familiar in my mouth, and the
vast majority of citizens would fain have
them as good and as cheap as possible for
the money. This cannot be as long as the
manufacturers thereof are denied the possi-
bilities of triumphant competition.

Joseph Cdok at a Banquet.
The mellifluous High Commissioner, Joseph
Cook, at an Imperial Industries Club dinner
in London, “pointed out the exceptional oppor-
tunities for establishing factories in Aus-
tralia, which was destined to become one of
the greatest manufacturing countries in the
world. It needed population and railways,
without which its progress was hampered.”
Then arose an embittered manufacturing
chemist, who said his firm had founded a
factory at Sydney in 1902, but the exor-
bitant price charged for unskilled or little-
skilled labor had, with other things, made
it a nightmare. They had, he said, to pay
the driver of a stationary engine the wage
of a first-class locomotive man. Here Joseph
Cook, who had no authorities by him, and
who quitted trades-union circles 28 years ago
and N. S. Wales State politics 22 years ago,
proceeded to earn his salary by declaring
such things impossible. The chemist person,
who doubtless remembered because the iron
had entered into his soul, replied that they
happened whether possible or not; and
thereupon the undignified ball of recrimina-
tion bounced to and fro. Finally, the High
Commissioner banged down the statement
that, anyhow, State and Federal taxation is
only £l2 per head per year in Australia,
whereas British taxation is £24. Neither
figure is correct, for Australian taxa-
tion was £lB Os. 7d. per head when
last heard of, while that of Britain
is £2l this year. The devastating
element of the case, however, is that,
while British taxation has begun to go down
now that the war is over, Australia is being
ruined by peace, combined with baby_ bonuses
and other worse instances of political cor-
ruption. In the last year of the war its
State and Federal taxes averaged £7 per
inhabitant. In the beautiful year of tran-
quillity and Hughes and Theodore and
Dooley just ended they passed the £l3 mark.
In 1918 the States added £20,000,000 to then-
debts. In 1921 they added £41,000.000.
Thanks to such taxes and loans it has been
possible to keep up quite a fuss in wages.
The average pay for a male (man or boy)
in N. S. Wales when the war left off was
655. lid. per week of 48 hours. It rose con-
tinuously during .the peace till it reached
the apex last September (no later figures
are available) with 955. 4d. and a demand
for 44 hours. The rise during the last 12
months, when prices were on the decline,
was Bs. 4d. per week for males and ss. Id.
for females. In the first 24 years after the
war N. S. Wales, where Joseph Cook be-
longs, kept the industrial pot heated by open-
ing seven new railways, of which six pay
no interest and only a modest part of their
working expenses, and are all growing worse,
while the seventh pays expenses and a scrap
of interest. They are all burdens on the tax-
payer. In fact, these seven new losers, none
very lengthy, swallow up the earnings of
433 male workers. There are 45 other and
older losers on the same game, and among
them they lose the earnings of 3060 male
toilers and the sustenance of their families.
It is said that the only hope for Australia
is to get a lot more like them. So the out-
sider to whom Joseph Cook “points out the
exceptional opportunities” in Australia, just
as they were pointed out some years ago to
Vestey, of the Port Darwin meatworks,
regards Australia as in a transition state,
and hangs, fire pending developments.
Turning the Other Cheek.
“Elburg” does his Christian duty:—
“Yours ever, Solomon Malaprop,” in his “Soft
Answer That Turneth Away Wrath” (B. 16/3/’22),
has handled his facts so carelessly that he must have
looked them up in the dark or employed Mary
Ann to do it for him in the intervals of grilling
hig morning chops. Most of his assertions are
inaccurate; the remainder have about as much
to do with the case as, to turn his phrase, his ances-
tors in Glasgow had to do with the building of
Solomon’s Temple.
One thing that sticks out like the Tower of Babel
on a billiard table is “Sol’s” Little Australianism,
the Commonwealth in his eyes consisting of the
Eastern coastal strip and an alleged streak of green
and gold leading through the centre of the Conti-
nent to Paradise in the North; the remainder being
a dustheap littered with empty bottles and sardine
tins. I repeat that the building of the Western rail-
way was a distinct pledge, although, like many other
things, it was not in the Constitution. As “Sol”
says, with a flash of almost superhuman intelligence,
it was not a condition Westralia made “with the
Federal Government or Prime Minister when it
joined up, for there was neither Federal Govern-
ment nor Prime Minister nor Parliament to bar-
gain with.” But there were Eastern Federal advo-
cates who assured the Westralian elector that the
East-West link would be forged without avoidable
delay. Practically everyone who voted “Yes” did so
on that understanding. The Federal Government
when it did arrive acknowledged the pledge in the
first Governor-General’s speech in the first Federal
Parliament. That was in 1901. The first sod was
turned in 1913, and the first train ran in October
1917. “Sol” persists in his assertion that the
Commonwealth “rushed to build the line.” How
irritated and flurried he must be by the snails tearing
up and down his garden paths !
It is true that Westralia has been too hard up to
convert its 370 miles of narrow-gauge line between
Perth and Kalgoorlie to the Commonwealth standard,
but while there remain over 1000 miles of 3ft.
6in. and sft. 3in. mixture between Port Augusta and
Albury, the Westralian fragment is relatively a
small matter.
“Sol” quotes me as saying that the line was not
expected to pay its way in its early days, and adds
“when the Golden Mile was in all its glory.” If
the reliability of “Malaprop’s” figures is to be
gauged by this statement, they may be dismissed
as a gross abuse of the linotypers’ time.
reached its pinnacle of glory as a gold producer in
1903, when the yield was worth about £8,800,000.
Fourteen years later, when the line was built, the
yield had shrunk to less than half of the 1903 out-
put. The waning of mining turned the State’s
attention to agricultural and pastoral production,
and as a business community instead of a floating
mining camp, quicker and more dependable means
of communication with the Eastern populations
became an urgent necessity to the Western people.
The gross revenue has improved between 1916 and
1920, and in the same period the passenger journeys
grew from 7667 to 22,968. What grounds “Sol”
has for his assertion that “the south to north line
should do better when it is finished” he does not
attempt—and wisely—to explain. Westralia did
offer a population of over 300,000 to give business
to the East-West railway, while “Sol's” pet, gaunt,
grey elephant in the Central North lost a serious
proportion of its white residents when three officials
were violently exported some time ago. At present
the Territory could provide little freight beyond
the piles of empty bottles which signify the princi-
pal activity of Darwin. I don’t disagree with “Sol’s”
contention that the Oodnadatta-I’ine Creek gap
should be bridged, but protest mildly against him
running amok like a demented Dervish filled with
corrosive fluid when the Great Western line is men-
tioned. As for patriotism, I would sooner possess
the “big check pattern with the fringe and strik-
ing design round the tummy” than wear a neck-
lace of over-ripe barracouta and a loincloth made
of a bone-dust bag, which appears to be the garb
of the prophet “Sol.”
Finally, in thus pacifically turning the other cheek,
I may mention that, long as it takes now for “Sol”
and me to exchange compliments, in the bad old pre-
railway days I would have had to wait much longer
before the post dropped his honeyed words into
my lap. Isn’t that something?

Gun Alley.
“Your Worship,” said the Last Ditch soli-
eitor kindly but firmly, “my client’s defence
is that the goods were never delivered, but
if they were delivered they were paid for.
If they were delivered and not paid for he
can prove that they were returned. Also,
they reached him in such a damaged condi-
tion as to be valueless. In any case, your
Worship, my client is not the right man, and
was brought here owing to a mistake in iden-
tity, but even if he is the right man he has
an alibi.” The case for the appeal in the
Gun-alley murder case was just as compre-
hensive. It began with an alibi for the
accused, based on his account of his move-
ments on the day of unpleasantness, and a
vague witness’s shadow-sketch of the real
criminal as glimpsed in the street. And it
extended to the proposition that a killing
done subsequent to rape might be only man-
slaughter. By four to one (Issacs, J., the
deftest hair-splitter on the Bench, dissent-
ing) the High Court decided that the. con-
viction was all right in law. There is no
reason to believe that it is less right in
equity, The crime was one of brilliant in-
capacity. The stripping of the body was
unaccountable unless the criminal hoped to
prevent identification, and that, as girls of
striking appearance don’t vanish every day,
was utter foolishness. But it helped the
case, for it suggested that the crime was com-
mitted near at hand. While a clothed body
may be passed off as a live person in the
course of conveyance, more especially if the
light is dim, a naked one is hard to account
for to even the most credulous Constable.
The nudity and the interval that had obvi-
ously elapsed between the death and the find-
ing of the body pointed to several things.
One of them was that the killing had been
done indoors as well as close at hand, for
the outdoor or casual back-lane criminal has
neither time nor space for arrangements like
that. He doesn’t worry about removing his
victim. He simply removes himself. It also
hinted at a person who had secluded pre-
mises close at hand (and a wine-shop which
wasn’t going to open again because the
license bad run out was secluded enough),
in which the remains could be kept while
tbe haggard owner made up his haggard
mind what to do next. It certainly didn’t
point to the vagrant assassin who carried
his premises under his arm. The field of
inquiry was thus very narrow, even if it
hadn’t been limited by the stripping of the
body, and the fact that Gun-alley isn’t a
vehicular haunt. When inquiry eliminated
establishments that had no secluded corners
by day. and those which were occupied by
large chatty families by night, the eye of
suspicion hadn’t much left to rest on, whereas
if the girl had been left fully dressed in
the middle of St. Kilda-road, to show that
. the criminal was either fleeing into Mel-
bourne or fleeing out of Melbourne in any
sort of vehicle, the police would have had
half Victoria to choose from.

“A Tribal Troubled Ireland.”
“M. P. Jageurs” replies to James Edmond’s
survey (B. 30/o/’22) :
Mr. Edjiqnd’s comments on Irish history are but
a plagiarised re-hash of an infamous article which
appeared in Whittaker’s Almanack of 1909, and
to which strong exception was taken by Irish
scholars and others in Britain. The sinister pur-
pose of the article was to assist the Anti-Irish propa-
ganda policy then pursued by the Unionist opponents
of Home Rule. Mr. Edmond’s belated co-operation
is as futile as was the Die-Hards’ opposition in the
House of Commons. The world is moving onwards,
not backwards. «
It is a common practice on the part of some
partisan writers and speakers, when condemning a
particular person, policy or event of bygone times,
to avoid using comparisons with other peoples or
countries of the same period. Mr. Edmond avoids
comparisons when falsely stigmatising the Irish
people as regicides. He refers to a remote age
and uses Whittaker’s tainted evidence to sustain
his unwarranted accusation. He evidently recognises
that the Irish, dynasty dates back to a time over
2000 years prior to the birth of the Anglo-Saxon
dynasty. The latter lasted from a.d. 827 to 1066
the Norman Conquest. It is a testimony to the
ancient Irish sense of loyalty to their kings, coupled
with a love of law and order, that the Irish dynasty
lasted unbroken for 2172 years. This is an answer
in itself to Mr. Edmond’s aspersions.
The only period that permits of comparison with
the Saxon dynasty is the 827-1066 one, that being
the full term of Saxon sovereignty. During those
239 years Ireland was governed by 14 kings in
regular succession, giving an average reign for each
king of over 16 years. For the same period in
England the 20 Saxon kings averaged only 12 years
apiece. Despite what Whittaker and Mr. Edmond
have stated regarding Irish regicides, it
is obvious that there was more security for a
crowned head in Ireland than in England. The
respective lives of Irish and Scottish kings during
the same period prove that there was considerably
more stability in Irish Royal stocks than there
was in Scottish, though both dynasties sprang from
a common ancestor. The Welsh record of local
independent princes for a slightly shorter period—
viz., a.d. 840 to 1063—was 12, with an average reign
of 18J years. Ancient Ireland has no cause to
fear comparison with any primitive country in
Europe where the liberty, culture, happiness and
progress of the people are concerned. Those who
in the face of historic facts maintain that Irishmen
are incapable of self-government are usually repre-
sentative of the class which for the past seven
centuries has resolutely denied them the opportunity
of trying.
It was not to be expected that James Edmond,
in his ignorance of the Gaelic tongue, could refrain
from burlesquing it. Stripped of its native dress and
bedecked with superfluous foreign letters, unintelli-
gible to a native Gaelic speaker, he holds up this
joint concoction of Whittaker and himself to
ridicule. The phonetic equivalents of the ancient
surnames are in our directories. In their ordinary
form no one considers as strange the names of
Farry, Feary, Fedim, Keogh, Toole, Sweeny,
Finerty, Flaherty, Lynch, Shanasy and David. The
surnames of other personages such as those of Germany,
Russia, Greece, Hungary and various mid-European
nations look no more formidable in English dress
than those he lampoons. The users of conglom-
erate English may smile at others, but they have
yet to explain to foreign students the rule, if any,
by which they inconsistently pronounce such of
their own surnames as Beauchamp, Brougham,
Oiiolmondeley, Colquiioun, Marjoribanks, Ruth-
ven, St. Clair, St. John, St. Leger, Wemysb and
many others which might be mentioned.
On the question of unity Mr. Edmond scoffs at
the three political parties in Ireland ; but he ignores
the fact that there are over 20 political divisions in
Britain irrespective of 700 religions, and, accord-
ing to Max O’Rell, but one sauce. The Irish were,
and still are, more united in their political aspira-
tions and their desire for national unity than their
neighbors across the channel, despite all that has
been said and written to the contrary.
If Mr. Edmond honestly desired to procure evi-
dence of Irish capacity to govern, he had but to
refer to the official Annals of Ireland, as systemati-
cally and regularly recorded in every century, or
to the works of any reputable historian familiar
with the ancient language, manners and customs of
the Irish people. He, however, prefers to lampoon
its kings, the majority of whom were patrons of
literature as well as of the arts and sciences. A study
of the achievements of the Irish race during the
sovereignty of their much-maligned kings would con-
vince honest inquirers that assaults, murders,
assassinations, destruction of properties and sucli
crimes, though general in all' countries where the
.clan and even the feudal systems prevailed, were
condemned by the laws •of Ireland and the male-
factors vigorously punished. It was the infliction of
such punishment by the Federal Government that
led to the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Ireland.
Long before the Christian era the Irish people
enjoyed full political freedom and protection in the
form of five State and one Federal Parliament con-
trolled b3 r universal suffrage. Courts of Justice
and of Appeal were regularly resorted to. Univer-
sities and other schools of learning were very
general and largely availed of by the people and
even by foreigners. A distinguished woman surgeon
figures amongst the medical faculty of the pre-
Christian period. Some of the oldest manuscripts
still in existence treat of medical and astronomical
questions. The sick, the aged and the infirm were
provided for as a national duty. The relations of
landlord and tenant, employer and employee, the
rights of women, especially regarding the pro-
perty of married women, and other social require-
ments, were all legislated for. In some cases, par-
ticularly of artisans and their tools of trade, the
legislation was ahead of any Australian labor enact-
ments.
So just, equitable and beneficial were the Brehon
laws of Ireland that when the people were won over,
en masse and without bloodshed, to Christianity few
adjustments were required to bring the Irish social
laws into complete harmony with Christian ethics.
Under Christian auspices, particularly from, the 6th
to the 10th centuries, and despite the ravages of
Norse pirates, overseas colonies were established in
far-away Iceland and Greenland, and even in America
centuries before Columbus discovered it. Swarms
of missionaries and scholars settled all over Europe,
where hundreds of the former are venerated to this
day by the grateful nations that benefited by their
unselfish labors. Ireland became the centre of West-
ern learning and welcomed to her great schools men
of every, and especially of the Egnlish, nation.
This is the proper standard of Irish self-achievement
for the world to judge the capacity of Irishmen by
as regards self-government, and not the wretched
travesty supplied by James Edmond.

Pocketing Fees Under False Pretences.
in the County Court yesterday no professional
appearance was entered on behalf of a plaintiff.
Plaintiff informed the Court that he had paid counsel
to act for him. Judge Woixarski said he thought it
disgraceful that a solicitor should take fees like that;
it was absolutely dishonest. He could not do any-
thing himself, but he thought the attention of tho
Law Institute ought to be directed to the matter.”
This is a scandal to which Tits Bulletin
lias often drawn attention and the Bench
lias been growing encouragingly restive about
it ot late. It is notable, however, that the
judicial rebukes are always addressed to the
Lower Branch of the profession, and never
by any chance to a leading ‘'silk.” And yet
the K.(\ in big practice is the worst offender
iV a J ;e States. What lie does is to collect
the fee marked on his brief in advance, on
the ground that he has no legal right to sue
tor it. If, on the day of the hearing, he finds
himseli faced with a more important matter
(tor which he has also pocketed his fee),
he lets the minor affair go by the board.
►Sometimes the abandonment is complete, but
oftener, in the jargon of the profession, he
farms out ’ the brief. In the latter event
he takes halt the fee. There are two reasons
why the stop-gap advocate is likely to be his
interior: (1) It would not be.in the K.C.’s
pr tessional interests to give an opportunity
co one likely by his work to catch the
instructing solicitor’s eye; (2) only a small
man is likely at short notice to undertake
a 1 esponsible job at cut rates. This conven-
tion of accepting money to perform a service,
oi itting to do the work and yet refusing
to return a penny of the cash, does not exist
“ * n y oth er walk of life. If a Iv.C. paid
±<>UU for a motor-car, and if the seller
«JioitJy after cashing the cheque announced
that he had disposed of the car to someone
else, but intended, nevertheless, to keep the
iI.C. s money, there would be a civil (if not
a criminal) action, and the trader would be
forced to disgorge. Nor would the advo-
cates indignation be much less if in place
of the new car he had paid for he was offered
an old one. By what process of logic or
equity, then, is a leading lawyer exonerated
upon committing what, in any other class,
would be considered a dishonest act if not
a crime/ The thing represents neither logic
n ? r . but 18 the outcome of a custom
which has persisted so long that many other-
wise clear-headed people have come to regard
it as just. Appeals to Bar Councils or Law
Institutes are bound to be futile. In the

olted for other people’s sins. Nearly all the early
ail way lines were built over wrong routes. They
id not follow the easiest grades, or, if they did
they hugged the coast and have had steamer com-
petition ever since. A shocking example is the
ago Central line, which penetrates the highlands
of the south for 155 miles by rail, making Dunedin
he poit ot outlet. The natural rort for that vast
nut-growing territory is Oamaru, distant about 80
miles by road. In expectation of the line being
built Oamaru constructed a breakwater port A
receiver is now in charge. Political influence dragged
he line through two rocky gorges to Dunedin and
bankrupted the Oamaru Harbor Board. To-dav
motor-lorries are running over the natural route
carrying most of the freight, and thev ply to
Oamaru. That is only one instance. There are
many more.
The South Island lines are losing the monev.
those m the North show a small profit. The wrong-
route trouble is worse below Cook Strait, since the
southern lines were mostly built in the bad old
days; conversely, the roads are better both in
grade and surface, and motor-lorries offer formid-
able competition. The North has hilly roads
and there is no direct trunk from north to south •’
moreover the main railway line rims through the
leart of the island. Another point is that there
are too many branch lines in the South. When
railway-building was cheap and there was no road
competition, lines that have,: never paid were built
into dozens of townships. Most of these branches
s.iould be closed, the rails torn up and the material
used in railway construction on uncompleted main
routes. The southern trunk line to Picton, the
finest port in Maoriland, and possibly in Australasia
is still unfinished.
While the Government is losing barrels of
money on the railways there are no complaints
from the private company that controls the
sea-gap between the northern and southern railway
systems. The volume of the passenger traffic on this
route may be judged from the fact that two fast
turbine steamers, of about 4000 tons, ply daily. It
is one of the finest ferry services in the world. It
pays. Perhaps if the Government acquired the
thing it wouldn’t pay. But that doesn’t alter the
fact that it should never have been let out of the
State’s hands. To expensively gather the traffic
by a score of tracks leading to Wellington on the
one side and Lyttelton on the other, and then to
pass the concentrated and cheaply-handled traffic
over to Private Enterprise—this is one of the choicest
samples of insanity any country can show. In mat-
ters of business the State is as foolish for what it
doesn't as for what it does.

Imprisonment for Debt.
One of the anachronisms which N.S.W’s de-
ceased Labor Government threatened to deal
with in its law-reform proposals was im-
prisonment for debt. Abolished in England
in 1869, in Ireland three years later and in
Scotland in 1880, it lingers on in Australia
in several forms. The “Ac exeat" weapon
lias often been used by reckless creditors in
N. S. Wales to good financial purpose in the
case of actors and similar birds of passage.
It provides that anyone who has become in-
debted over and above a certain moderate
sum may, on the creditor making an affidavit
in respect of his (the debtor’s) imminent
departure from the State, be arrested and
cast into gaol. In Sydney last week a
Supreme Court Judge and a jury of four
considered a claim for false imprisonment
by a lady against a firm of solicitors which
revealed another facet of the same idea. The
solicitors had appeared for her in divorce.
Her husband had not paid her costs; and
defendants were misled by the production by the
husband to the sheriff’s officer of receipts which the
defendants believed were receipts by the wife for
DOOLEY'S EASTER EGO.
the money due as costs in the divorce and common
law proceedings, whereas in fact the wife had not
received any of the money or given a receipt for it.
So the wife was arrested on a provisional
warrant at Adelaide and lodged in prison.
And there she remained till she found the
money to satisfy a debt she did not owe.
U hen Mr. Pickwick was languishing in the
h leet. owing to his recalcitrancy over the
Pardeix trouble, an idea still existed in
British communities that it was natural
and right for gaolers to be used as debt-
collectors. It was a survival of the Roman
theory 0t the relative importance of human
rights and property rights. Dickens had a
good deal to do with the change of heart

a year before his death: in the press and

erated that the onus was on the seller to
estimate the character of a would-be debtor,
and that if the seller made an error the
State had nothing to do with the matter.

directions, to the rotten old principles (1)
that inability to pay a debt on a given date
should be regarded as a crime, and (21 that

A Gold Standard without Any Gold.
“Callan Park” has another idea:—
Seeing that the U.S.A. now holds 70 per cent, of
the world’s gold; that it is demanding-,, in the form
of reparations and payments on account of maintain-
ing its Rhine army, most of the remaining 30 per
cent. ; and that, owing to Government restrictions
on gold-trading- and the vastly increased cost of
gold-mining, very little gold is being- produced, the
time seems ripe to give gold the go-by and turn to
some other standard.
Gold came into use for token purposes, originally,
because, in addition to being easy to carry, hard
to destroy, divisible without difficulty, and so
forth, it had a unique value for ornamental pur-
poses. For about 50 centuries men and women
have been adorning themselves with it. “What
female heart can gold despise?” inquired Gray a
century and a quarter ago. If he put the question
to-day the correct answer would be: “Every female
heart, whether it beats beneath a lady’s ‘Diana’
corset or a gentleman’s dress waistcoat.” Gold as
a setting for precious stones is out of fashion,
probably for good. The modern wedding-ring is of
platinum. Men of the Ross type still have their
front teeth filled with gold, but it has become a
symptom of indigence. Successful nigger pugs
use diamonds or nothing. Gold bangles and gold
chains have gone the way of gold rings; and gold
services of plate which, even as late as Thackeray's
day, were brought out on special occasions by rich
families, are now regarded as vulgar. Three beauti-
ful sets were auctioned in London last year, and
only one found a buyer. It was not for lack of money.
At about the same time someone offered £4500 for
one little painting by Degas and failed to get
it. Platinum to-day is what gold was in the
time of the Caesars. The Parisian or London
Litcullus wears it on his wrist, as a Watch; the
modern Cleopatra who dines at S-hepheard's with
her Anthony hangs it round her neck. So that
from the standpoint of world-desirability the mountain
of gold which the U.S. Government has accumulated
and is adding to, begins to approximate to the
shark’s teeth hoards of the Fijians, the wampum
beads of the American Indians, the porcelains of
the East Indies.
Nine-tenths of the world’s platinum supply comes
from Russia; and a century ago, when the exist-
ence of the metal had been known only about 50
years, the Russians began using it for coinage
puiposes. However, as no one knew much about
the working of it then, the experiment failed. At
the present time platinum can be worked as easily
as gold. It ha 3 been found in Borneo, many of
the American States, Ireland, Norway, Lapland, Aus-
tralia, M.L. and S. America—which was the first
country to present it to the world. And, no doubt,
with an added demand there would be further dis-
coveries and an increased supply.
Why should not stricken Europe, and those
countries overseas which trade largely with Europe,
set about the accumulation of platinum reserves in
place of the gold reserves they have lost ? As Bol-
shevist Russia, where the metal abounds, has sunk
to much the same position, industrially, as Australia
occupied when the first gold discoveries were made,
it would readily pay in platinum for the manufac-
tured goods which it must have and which Britain,
France, Germany, Austria and Italy are eager to
sell. It should not be difficult, in point of fact,
to get the Russians to barter all their platinum as
in pre-war days they were prepared to barter most
of their oil. Russia, like China, has always had
a predilection for a single silver standard—a
tendency which might be fostered in the interests
both of those countries with plenty of silver, like
England, and of those which have been drained o
all their gold, like France. Let it now be assumed
that the former gold-owning countries—Britain and
its white dominions, Germany, the Scandinavian
kingdoms, France, Spain, Belgium, etc.—have as
their unit of value a beautiful coin, much harder
to counterfeit than a gold one, and with a weight-
ratio to silver not of 15 or 16 to one, as in the
case of gold, but of 40 or 50 to one. The U.S.A.
would only be able to acquire this money by pay-
ments of gold devaluated to about the figure at
which silver now stands; or of goods which would
first have to climb the lofty tariff walls which all
the nations are busy erecting against their neigh-
bors. As for Europe, once the demonetization of gold
compelled Rheims to ask the U.S. VO or 80 gold
louis for a case ‘of champagne which was saleable
(in platinum) for 200 francs; and once Bond-street
(London) began to ask Fifth-avenue (N. York) CO
or 60 sovereigns for a suit of clothes which was
priced in English money at 168 shillings, then the
mass of gold which has crossed the Atlantic would
not be long in gravitating back to its old haunts.
The U.S. debt would be discharged.
What is the objection to this simple scheme for
putting Europe on a solvent basis? Nothing more
nor less than that inexplicable trait in human nature
which is manifested with peculiar clearness every-
where outside lunatic asylums. It is the charac-
teristic which has made a laughing-stock of the
Freetrade doctrine of 70 years ago; ruined every
attempt at a Communist State; rendered inter-
nationalism impossible and war inevitable.
Nations which speak different languages and have
different standards of culture will not come
together and, after discussion, act in a
strictly rational manner. And so, the nations
will no doubt stick to the gold standard,
though its raison d’etre is almost as dead as the
iron standard of the Lacedaemonians; and such
bullion as we win back from the Yanks will have
to be acquired by the dreary old methods of hard
saving and hard work.
The strenuous time through which farmers
are passing is illustrated by the bankruptcy
of a valuable Wanganui (M.L.) estate. The
assets are valued at £210,000, and the lia-
bilities total £200,000, all except £3OOO
secured. The secured creditors comprise
various persons holding first mortgages; and
stock-and-station agents who carried the
estate for some time are creditors for
£77,000 on second mortgage. Throughout
Maonland landowners are being forced to
file, and in some districts bankruptcies con-
stitute the main work for the lawyers. Many
fending cos. are trying to assist genuine case's
of hardship by reducing the rate of interest •
but all the signs point to a cold winter. We
are reaching the point to which the
IJ.fe.A. came over a year ago. The price of
everything the farmer has to sell has fallen
out of all proportion to the price of what
he has to buy from the citv; and there can
be only one end to that. But it is the city
and the city worker who will suffer most in
the long run. The farmer can at least exist
on pumpkins. The city worker when he
falls unemployed can’t even grow pumpkins.
It looks as though even a Gun-alley horror
has its attractions for hysterical females. The
Victorian courts have lately 'met a couple
of cases of alleged sexual assault in which
the testimony of the assaultee has been
broken down by overwhelming evidence in
rebuttal, leading, of course, to the dismissal
of the charge and an unwelcome advertise-
ment for the alleged offender. One Mel-
bourne female charged a young married man
with coming into her back yard late at night
with the purpose, she said, of making an
attack on her virtue. There was abundant
evidence to show that he was home in bed
at the time of the alleged outrage, and, in
fact, hadn t left his house the whole even-
ing; yet the upshot was the usual dismissal,
the man getting no redress and the woman
no punishment. Any woman, as our laws
are administered, can make any man a victim
Pornographic imagination without

“F. 8.” on a patch of history:—
Andrew Fisher's elevation to the Prime Minister-
ship of Australia was always a joke to us Queens-
landers who knew him intimately, for beyond a
“nice bedside manner” his only qualification was the
purely negative one that he had not made so many
enemies as certain other eligibles. When the great
Queensland Labor split of 15 or 16 years ago
occurred over the nationalisation of everything cn
God's earth, Fisher, M. Reid and O. McDonald
championed the insane proposal to make all the means
or production, distribution and exchange public pro-
perty, and assisted thereby to drive out of the party
Kidston, Kerr, Airey and about a dozen others who
refused to bend the knee to the Trades Hall Baal.
It is interesting in the face of this to note that
Fisher posed at Kilmarnock as an opponent of the
nationalisation of mines, and that Senator M. Reid
is now fairly happy in the bosom of the, anti-
nationalising party. But the men they assisted to
drive out had to endure half a generation of obloquy
for daring to put up a fight in favor of sanity. One
wonders if Fisher ever reads the reports of Queens-
land’s State enterprises, and ponders, as he reads,
over the glorious days when he wanted to nationalise
everything and expel into the outer darkness every-
body who didn’t. Kilmarnock was not so unjust,
after all, in refusing to have him as its Labor
candidate for the Commons.

POLITICAL POINTS
The trade returns of the Commonwealth
for the year to last June are an essay on
the art of being poor. Imports were over
£3O per head, which was £l2 more than in
nie previous year. This wasn’t because prices
were. higher; they were lower, but the quan-
tity increased.' As people couldn’t wear or
eat and pay fdr twice as much as in 1920
they bought lesa of our own goods, and em-
ployment ran short. As exports were only
£24 per head the country ran in debt over
£30.000.000 merely for goods, and about
£15.000.000 more \for interest on old liabili-
ties. In short, it borrowed £45.000.000 and
bought poverty and laziness with the money.
Also it bought ignorance, for the boys were
learning to wharf-lump and counter-jump
instead of to be engineers and the like.
“Scrutineer” expounds a theory:—
The Bulletin is, only partly right in its conten-
tion that the recent election was a “sectarian”
fight, using the word as referring to a contest
bttween religious sects. I travelled a good deal
of the State during the campaign, and what I found
was a revolt against the domination of the party
by the Irish Brigade. The Australian, generally
speaking, doesn’t care a d—n what a man’s religion
may be.; He regards Mick Burrrk as a good fellow,
and if he can talk a bit and use bis hands,
as he generally can, he admires him. It was only
when, along with Pat O’Sullivan and Dinny O’Regan,
Mick tried to get control of the political machine,
with the object of constituting himself and his clan
as a governing class and shoving out of all the
good jobs those who haven’t a rich brogue, that
the Australian elector woke up, and Mick doesn’t yet
know what hit him. If the Scotchbyterians tried
to grab control of our industrial and political
machinery they would get it in the neck just the
same.
From Winchcombe-Carson’s “Annual Wool
Review”:—
Competition from the Australian section has been
no small factor in maintaining values at local sales.
In the dull days of the market, prior to last mid-
year,: their biddings proved especially useful. Apart,
therefore, from other considerations, the buoyant
business in the mills has proved of material assist-
ance to the woolgrowing industry.
Thus does Protection heap coals of fire on
the squatters who fought for Freetrade to
the day of its death.
A flaw as large as a good-sized chasm dis-
closed itself in the system of caucus-selected
Ministries when Dooley was unable to oust
McGirr from the team which the latter’s
public tactics were calculated to destroy.
When Pat Jennings had to deal with Dibbs,
an insurgent and extremely violent and recal-
citrant colleague, he was at least able to
resign as Premier and then reconstruct with
the recalcitrant one shut out. Dooley could
not resign to get rid of his recalcitrant
colleague, who had the same right at the
Cabinet table as Dooley had, viz., the right
of caucus election. So the Ministry stuck
on like the Kilkenny cats till the dtbdcle
—a debacle very largely “mothered” by Mr.
Gregory McGirr.
The cruiser Adelaide was given its speed-
trials last week, and the resuirs moved the
Sydney papers to build columns to the glory
of the performance. In particular, the people
who will have to pay the million and a half
she cost were given to understand that it
was an advantage not to rush the build-
ing—that, though she had been--nearly-five
years on tire stocks, she is really innoiforh-
ship, her plans having been altered from
time to time. Obviously a mistake has been
made in launching her now: if she had been
just pottered with till 1937 she would at
launching be 15 years more modern than
she is.
From an old hand on the Goldfields: —
In Bendigo we understand Hughes’s dubious state
of mind with regard to the advisability of seeking
a softer seat much better than you do abroad.
Bendigo is essentially a radical seat. It has oft.n
gone Labor, and never completely recanted, though
dazzled to some extent by the idea of having a
Prime Minister all to its own cheek. It has, how-
ever, now got over its first burst of blatant self-
satisfaction, and has learned how little there is
of glory and oats, after all, in owning a Prime
Minister. The more radical element in his backing
is using a rude tone towards its representative,
and demanding more butcher’s meat and fewer flowers
of oratory. Hughes is not forthconiing with the
chops and gives no promise of an early delivery of

But the Labor party is really taking itself by the neck and the pants and throwing
itself out.
corned beef; so disgusted radicals avow their
intention of kicking him hard. Meanwhile the
little object of all this contemplated attention
declines to say a word, but he is thinking like
the very Devil.
Eight Ministers are enough for N.S.W.
and its two million people; but no sooner
were the loaves and fishes assured than Full-
erites began sketching out a 13-man Economy
Cabinet. And /even then there were four
portfolios not /allotted —those of the Min-
isters for Crooked Railways and Superfluous
Distances, for Closed Ports, for Rural De-
population, and for Debts and Deficits.
Besides “fixing up” Bill Lennon, ex-presi-
dent of the Leg. Council, with a salary for
life, the Queensland Government has pro-
vided Tom Nevitt, ex-Chairman of Com-
mittees, with a job at £250 per annum. Of
course, all the ex-Leg. Councillors retain
their gold railway passes, and the public
..might.like, to know if their wives—for whom
a kind Labor Government some five years ago
also provided gold passes—still retain their
little ornaments as well. “The loser pays,”
and the taxpayer is always a loser when a
Cabinet of the Theodore brand effects a
“reform.”
“Canty”: I live 130 miles from Newcastle
(N.S.W.), and, having to go there fre-
quently, I bought a six-months’ railway pass.
It cost £34. I could have got a first-class
one to Sydney, which is 90 miles further on,
for £3B! I lodged the only protest I could —
i.e., gave my first and last preferences to the
Progressives at the State election.
The familiar tale has just been told about
the Vic. Government cool store, into whose
management Kelley, P.M., has been holding
an official inquiry. Superintendent-eng.neer
French is found to be a weak administrator,
with the result that things went on any-
how. Motor-cars were repaired in Govern-
ment time, odd jobs were done for outsiders,
and goods were carried away. It is true
that millions of pounds’ worth of goods were
handled with very little loss, but in regard
to small things members of the staff had
half-persuaded themselves that they were the
owners of the show. As always on Such
occasions the boss has to take the whole
blame; but how much really belongs to the
men who, white mostly yelling for State
Enterprise, conspire to cover State Enter-
prise \yith contempt?
The 150th “expert” lately reported on the
cotton prospect of Aust.alia, which is thus
one expert ahead of the South-to-North
railway route. Tb« gist of bi« tale was that
cotton is a well-known substance and in
great demand. It is fairly easy to grow, and
a not unusual net return for one man’s work
on 20 acres is said to be £327 per annum.
There is a big local market, for the annual
imports run to millions. The 150th expert
said there is a belt of country 200 miles
broad, extending from south to north of
Queensland on which cotton could be grown
without costly irrigation. Also there are
districts along the Murray where it can be
grown with expensive irrigation. The Prime
Minister promptly manifested great interest
in the Murray scheme, where the plants
could be under his personal supervision.
Boundless faith in his personal supervision
is one of the Pryminister’s characteristics.
Some discussion about the rise of ss. per
1000 in the price of bricks, due to the 44-
hours-per-week fad, drew attention to the
N.S.W. State brickworks. This concern,
it is claimed, shows “highly satisfactory re-
sults,” and even “sells bricks to the public
at prices greatly below those ruling outside.”
Now the complaint is reiterated that the
concern pays no State or Federal taxes
or local rates, that it gets its electric cur-
rent from the municipality at half-price, and
that the bricks it sells to the Government—
its principal customer —are deadheads on
the railways. Tn simple words, it is charged
with being an impudent pauper with a bogus
balance-sheet—one that exists to make a
lying reputation for politicians, on the
strength of which they steal votes. When
the great cleaning-up arrives it should be
enacted that every public enterprise, includ-
ing the railways, shall be debited with
exactly the same tax burdens as a private
one, and the fool’s paradise of bogus balance-
sheets should be abolished. Winning our
own money from ourselves with loaded dice
isn’t much of an occupation.
From ex-German Samoa :
Fritz is at his old games again. Recently bundles
of trade journals arrived in Samoa for the leading
business firms. Enclosed were alleged newspapers
printed in English containing bitter attacks on
Britain and France. This sort of propaganda was
used extensively by the Huns in the prison camps—
any ex-prisoner of war will remember the Gazette
deb Ardennes and the Continental Times. What
with the Boches in Samoa fostering discontent
amongst the natives,, and the Huns outside sending
their filthy propaganda into the country, the M.L.
Government has a rough track to travel. And it
will get rougher if this kind of thing is taken lying
down.
Now that Queensland is the only Austra-
lian State with a Labor Government, the
North may look out for some desperate gam-
bling from Theodore in an effort to retain
office. The chief card, of course, will be
the expenditure of American dollars in
localities where the election issue is at all
dubious. Already the Premier has been ex-
horting the farmers to combine and co-
operate, and slily assuring them that money
will be available to assist them in their
virtuous endeavors. The old “nationalisa-
tion” gag is in abeyance just now, as it isn’t
wise to draw attention to the condition of
State enterprises. “Dollars ahoy !” will be
the next slogan.
“F. Born”: “Pollio” remarks (B.
16/3/’22) that technically-trained young
Australians don’t step out of our Universi-
ties into waiting billets as they do in Canada.
Whose fault is it? The young fellows are
there, able and plentiful enough, but the big
machine-shops and factories are not waiting
for them. Just so long as people like the
owpers of the Newcastle and Lithgow works
are regarded by Labor organisations as
enemies and robbers, there will be no hope
for big industries, big faqtories or big
bra : ns. Canada has one great advantage—
it hasn’t divided its people into Labor and
anti-Labor, and its politics are not run on
class lines; it is the country, not the class,
that is considered. No wonder it makes
such progress.
A man who probablv didn’t feel very sorry
when the Dooley Government began to crack
up was Treasurer Lang. He got no lime-
light. He had no hope of promotion. He
had the thankless job of scavenging round
for the money to finance the projects that
kept Dooley and McGirr well advertised.
And the probable wreckage of an old land-
and-house-dealing business by three more
years of Dooleyism was more perhaps than
the salary was worth. Very likely Dooley,
whose life has of late been one bitter struggle
to save his portfolio from the jawg of
McGirr, wasn’t sorry either. That restless
landlord may now drift to Federal politics
and leave a shred of peace behind him.
From a recent outpouring by Sydney archi-
tect Sulman:— t
Town-plannirg is everything. It affects city life,
art] shoi'ld be developed along the same lines as
house-planning.
But where is the nicely-Dlanned new town
that these ardent town-planners planned? Or
where will it be? And when will it be?
If N. S. Wales was cut into three States
there would he new capitals and seaports to
build.; but the planners take no visible in-
terest in New State movements, and just
hang round th Q old spot. If it were looking
for something really active The Bulletin
would as soon join a Jacobite League.
WE LOST THE WAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
No doubt my friends mean well enough
Who stand up on their gouty toes
And yell this “love of country” stuff,
This “sacrifice to beat her foes.”
No doubt they get a lot of fun
Who fight again the battles won.
I’ve seen a fat man on a box
Turn purple as, with mounting pride.
He told in language orthodox
What took us to the “other side” ;
“They went because their country called,”
Was mainly what the fat man bawled.
The fat man may be right, of course—
He ought to know ; he watched it through.
But still I feel he’s missed the force
That prompted blokes like me and you
To toss our civvies in a box,
And clothe our feet in army socks.
The fact about the matter is
We’d stood these chaps so very long;
We. knew their loyalty was biz.,
And whether for the right or wrong
We- merely fled this land of yell
And went to have a quiet spell.
But as this class of vapid tripe
Has since increased one-hundred fold,
We Diggers think the time is ripe
To let it out that we were sold;
For who has heard this class of bore
And still believes we won the war?

There was not the same spring in the figures
last year as in the abnormal period just
before. A continuance of such favorable
conditions as those of 1920 could not have
been hoped for. Nevertheless, the big A.M.P.
grew so much bigger during the year that,
though claims were heavier and operations
generally more costly, the year’s excess of
income over outgo was easily a record. The
ratio of surplus per £lOO of income
Was, however, 16s. less last year than
for 1920, and that meant that £47,000
more flowed out. The A.M.P. shows two
kinds of surplus each year: (1) the portion
of the period’s income which is added to
funds; and (2) the excess of funds (includ-
ing the year’s additions) over and above esti-
mated liabilities under policies. Last year’s
actuarial surplus was also a record : actuary
Elliott was able to scrape together a divi-
sible surplus of £1.489,753. and £160.170
more bonuses are being distributed than in
the previous year. This is the largest sum
ever distributed, and the ratio of the bonuses
to participating premiums is better than in
the long-ago boom years:—

The record surpluses have been the bright
spots in the year's operations. But there
have been other happenings less cheerful
from the management’s viewpoint. The ex-
pense rate continues to move in the wrong
direction :
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1905.. £8 15 6 p.c. 1916.. £8 16 3 p.c.

1915.. 8 9 7 „ 1921.. 10 2 5 „
The ss. 2d. p.c. increase on the 1920 figures
is of greater significance because in the
former year a much larger volume ’of new
business was written, and new business is
always costly. For every £lOO of renewal
premiums collected in 1920 new policies
brought in £lO 125.; last year £9 Bs. A
smaller crop of proposals would, under nor-
mal conditions, tend to reduce the general
expense rate. However, many of the policies
written in 1920 were financed by Digger
gratuities, and that business was, on the
whole, got cheaply. During the past year
there has been no such artificial aid. The cost
of new business is a matter of consequence
in a life office. How much it costs the A.M.P.
is not definitely ascertainable. By adopting
The Bulletin's usual method of allowing
the cost of old business as 7 p.c. of renewal
premiums (and 3 p.c. for single-premium
business) and charging the balance of exes,
against first premiums, this rather startling
increase in new business costs shows up :-^-

1921 .. 3,281,006 310,120 595,440 117.6 „
But the basis is- quite arbitrary, and jthe.
method provides a basis for comparison rather
than an accurate statement of costs. Pro-
bably old business costs more than 7 p.c.
nowadays; but even allowing another \ p.c.
something more than first premiums is
absorbed by policy-writing.
Costs have steadily grown until they are now
275. more per £lOO of income than in 1914;
thus about £79,000 more is now' spent
than would have been the experience, if the
1914 cost-rate had continued. But the
society has been more than compensated in
another way: the conditions w'hich made
operations more expensive also made money
dearer, and the interest return on average
funds has improved in this way:—
Interest Realised on Average Funds.
1905.. £4 9 8 p.c. | 1918. . £5 1 9 p.c.
1910.. 4 9 8 „ I 1919., 51 5 „
1914.. 4 12 10 „ 1920., 5 4 10 „
1916.. 4 17 5 „ I 1921.. 5 5 5 „
Funds are earning 12s. 7d. p.c. more than
in 1914, and on latest average funds a quar-
ter-million or so more flows in each year.
For every £1 more which goes in exes, about
£3 7s. extra is won from investments.
In view of these happenings it is not sur-
prising that, though lire assurance costs the
public no more than formerly, larger amounts
are available for bonuses now that losses by
death have again become normal. Meantime,
though, further internal strengthening has
been in progress. When estimating policy
liabilities actuary Elliott now assumes
future interest earnings throughout in the
Ordinary department as only 3 p.c., though
funds are at present earning at least 2i p.c.
more than that. The reserve for policy lia-
bilities of £42,115,587 as, at December 31
last was consequently 2£ millions greater
than would have been the case had 3| p.c.
interest been assumed as formerly, and
five millions more than if a 4 p.c. valuation
had been made. The A.M.P. is thus buttressed
by huge internal reserves-—established, by
anticipating interest-earnings conservatively
and by the contingency margins which stand-
ard actuaries’ tables invariably allow for.
Besides these reserves there is £200.000 in
an investment fluctuation reserve which will
not be tapped unless the society is called
upon to realise on its investments before they
mature, or unless over-large advances have
been made on mortgages.
The Industrial branch continues to grow
rapidly:—

Expenses at 30.5 p.c. are no heavier than
two years ago and slightly less than for
1920. But costs of Industrial business are
three times those of Ordinary: convincing
evidence that the Industrial policy-holder
cannot hope for anything like the same re-
sults as are offering for the insurer who can
contract to pay premiums quarterly. For
the first time the Industrial branch shows
a vear’s addition to funds exceeding half-a
million. Funds at December 31 were not far
short of three millions, and the actuary
estimated a surplus of £64,429, of which
£48,616 is being distributed in bonuses. The
society has to date distributed more than 27
millions in bonuses tp- Ordinary policy-
holders and £201,000 in - the Industrial
branch.

Though Howard Smith’s makes its living
chiefly out of ships and coal-mines,' its
balance-sheets and directors’ annual talks tell
you next to nothing about those enterprises.
It is a holding co. only, and owns shares
in thle concerns which run the Ships and
mines. Its profits represent so much of the
earnings of; the;
care to take, plus the bit it makes by acting
as managing-agent for the piip cos. and
whatever is got from its own funds not in-
vested with the subsidiaries. Paid capital
at December 3l was two millions, and, in-
cluding the year’s profits, there were visible
reserves of £795.877. Assets: £2,486,283 of
shares in other cos.; £62.463 of property;
£30,70S in plant and gear; £78,696 of coal
stocks and general stores; and £137,454 sur-
plus of Government securities,_ .book debts
and cash over and above &11 liabilities.
The Howard Smith sea-going interests are
moored to Australian Steamships, Ltd., con-
.Cerning the affairs of which the public can
learn next to nothing. But, like others, dur-
ing the war years it no doubt made htlge
profits from trading, and also piled up large
surpluses from sales of steamers at boom
prices. Some of the cash banked up has
lately been re-invested in ships, the Era
(5350 tons) and Cycle (6720 toils) having
been acquired when shipping prices slumped
last year. How the Australian Steamships
accounts now stand cannot be guessed at:
but that concern had done so well that after
it had, reconstructed more than half-a-million
,suddehly dropped into Howard Smith coffers.
The parent then raised divs. on ordin-
aries from 10 to 15 p.c., and, despite ship-
ping slackness, that rate has been maintained.
The subsidiaries are now apparently so com-
fortably financed, no doubt chiefly, as
a result of the exceptional profits
earned during the war years, that if
has been decided to return portion
of the parent’s capital. The half-nrllion
of 6 p.c. cum.,prefs. are to be released* Hold-
ers naturally, readily agreed: they can nowa-
days get up to two points more for their
money. What effect the withdrawal of one-
fourth .of the paid capital will have on the
balance-sheet cannot be determined from _ the
published announcements. Several 'things
may happen in a concern which has a silent-
working subsidiary of the Australian Steam-
ships type to feed it. How Howard Smith’s
eo’fld undertake the repayment of the half-
million on its own account is not evident
from the December accounts. They showed
£396,137, of nuhlic securities, deposits and
cash, rind; £272 34J) of • book debts. But on
the other side £457*478 Was owing to sundry
creditors, and the co. had £73.55,4 left with
it on deposit, the surplus of these ass°ts over
liabilities beine only £137.454. How £500.000
is . to be found, even if every Government
bond is marketed, is, therefore, a mystery.
There is apparently a good deal more in the
return of pref. capital than meets the eye.

The public is still to some extent directly
interested in the collieries in which Howard
Smith, Ltd.,' holds large parcels of scrip
and from which it makes a bit by way of
commission for acting as managing-agent.
So both the Caledonian and Invincible cos.
publish accounts. A formal auditors’ certi-
ficate attests that each lot of accounts pre-
sented “exhibits a true and correct view
of the state of the co.’s affairs, according to
the best of our information and the explana-
tions given to us,” but the public would
be almost as wise if no accounts at all
were presented. The Caledonian Collieries
management does not attempt to show how
each year’s declared profit is arrived at;
no P. and L. account is published, and one
line in the balance-sheet sets forth the
net earnings claimed. No information can
therefore be got concerping such important
matters as the amounts laid aside for depre-
ciation of mines and plant. The intro-
ductory table gives the profits as claimed
by the management, and they at least show
that the Caledonian has shared in the pros-
perity generally experienced by colliery
owners since Prime Minister Hughes and
his Coal Tribunal have been at hand to re-
adjust selling prices promptly as production
costs increased. The co.’s principal pro-
ducers are the Aberdare mines, on the
Maitland field, but there are also two col-
lieries at West Wallsend (Borehole seam),
and the Waratah (Bur Wood seam). The
]920 output was 1,621,087 tons and last
year’s 1,829,482 tons. Net profits in the
former year were Is. 7.7 d. per ton produced
and last year Is. 7.4 d.
The Caledonian group was taken over
from a Scotch crowd, and a lot of fresh capi-
tal has been raised from time to time to
develop and equip the properties. _ Seven
years ago paid capital was £852,507; but
a substantial portion of that was water,
the venture having been capitalised at a
figure in excess of what had been paid the
former owners. However, by 1920 new
share subscriptions had increased paid capi-
tal to £1,191,755 and last year £296,139 more
was raised, making £1,487,894 of scrip,
£464,295 of it prefs. eligible for a maxi-
mum 8 p.c. Balance-sheet movements over
three years have been as follows:

So great has been the demand on funds for
development and equipment and to finance
the co.’s increased trade that liabilities are
larger than they were two years ago.

This little N. S. Wales back-country enter-
prise can show the State a point of two in
running railways without loss. The difference
between the Deniliquin-Moama concern and
the State undertaking is that if the co. does
not make a do of things there is nobody to
whom it can turn to perform the confidence-
trick. If there is no profit shareholders can
get no interest; the London capitalists who
are the real owners of the State railways get
their divs. no matter how great the losses
made bv State control. The Deniliquin-
Moama is one of the few private railways
in the Commonwealth, and it would long ago
have been under the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment’s wing if it had fed the State system.
Instead, it connects an isolated portion of
the south-western country with the Vic. rail-
ways, and under these circumstances Mac-
quarie-street has never questioned the pro-
priety of private ownership. Nor. have
profits been sufficiently tempting to induce
Parliament to take it over. Still, considering
the fact that the railway does not traverse a
closely-settled district and that the seasons
are erratic, the co. has not done at all badly.
From 1905, when the State began to recover
from one of its worst droughts, down to
1916 5 p.c. divs. were paid without a break;
and since £25,000 of reserves were tacked on
to the old capital of £lOO,OOO in 1911. that
div. for a time gave a return of 61 p.c.
Nowadays 7 p.c. p.a. is paid, giving 8J p.c.
on the monev put in by the old-timers.
While small divs. were paid surplus profits
were banked up, and these were used'to dis-
charge a debenture debt. Consequently in
L 6 years this improvement has been effected:

Launceston’s gas co. began operations 64
years ago. but since 1890 it has had compe-
tition from the municipality, which harnessed
the South Esk to electric venerators. So
there is not much profit: 4 p.c. is the best
the co. ha§ been able to do for shareholders
for very many years. Still the demand
for gas has steadily grown, and during the
past half 29§ million feet were manufactured,
seven millions more than in 1915 and 10
millions more than in 1910. The co. pas
evidently been able to get its selling prices
sufficiently in advance of increased costs to
show improved profits. The past half was the
co.’s best run, but a larger amount than on
any previous occasion has been written off

By an old London broker:—
Robert Nivison’s monopoly as stockbroker for the
Commonwealth, Maoriland, India and Canada is
being challenged by a new combine of brokers called
the British Stock Brokers’ Trust, representing 250
firms of London and provincial stockbrokers who
desire to have a “cut” at the highly-profiteering busi-
ness of underwriting what are despitefully called
“colonial” loans. When Nivison left the London and
Westminster Bank to join the Stock Exchange he
started to specialise in Government loans, and was
backed by the great Scottish insurance societies.
His first big underwriting was in 1898, when the
late E. G. Fitzgibbon visited London to float the
first Melbourne Board of Works loan. Nivison’s
colleagues were Mullens, Marshall and Daniell, brok-
ers to the Bank of England, J.. H. Coates and Co.,
Faithfull, Begg and Co., and Scrimgeour and Co.
His best friend and supporter was a millionaire, the
late E. T. Doxat, chairman of Dalgety’s, and then
also chairman of the National Discount Co., one
of the shrewdest and most powerful of London finan-
ciers. For many years the wee ginger-haired, quiet-
mannered Scotchman, called by his familiars “The
Canary,” has had a virtual monopoly of under-
writing all the big issues, and has been uniformly
successful. Evidently he has “done his dash.” having
been buried in the House of Lords as Baron Glendyne,
so his rivals have grown bolder. One effect of the
contest has been that the Victorian Government
lately borrowed £4,000,000 of 5 i p.c. money at
99, and Macpherson, Vic. State Treasurer, got a
lot of credit for his foresight that he did not earn,
The only time Nivison went near making a big loss
was when he lent the old North Mt. Lyell Co.
£lOO,OOO on its railway from Kelly’s Basin to
Queenstown (Tas.). So he saved both the Lyell cos.
by wangling their amalgamation.
Edna May Deeps (W.A.) failed with its
application for forfeiture of the adjoining
Central leases. A small block of stone on
the boundary of Deeps and the Edna May
is practically all that remains of Westonia
as a goldfield. Central ground contains some
thousands of tons of lodwt. ore at 400 ft., and
it might be extracted by means of a crosscut
from Deeps. But the cost of handling the
deluge pouring into Central (60.000 gM.
hourly) makes any such effort unprofitable.
Deeps is a concern that promised much. In
1918 the manager reported that the mine had
“an ore reserve valued at £151,000 above the
No. 5 level. This ore should yield, and will
yield under reasonable management, £BO,OOO
to £lOO,OOO in dividends, and I believe the
reef will continue valuable to great depth.”
Performances: £lO,OOO in divs. paid, mostly
from sale of reserve shares. Ore reserves
are booked to cut out in three months.
* * # *
At last the State battery at St. Ives
(W.A.) has spoken on behalf of Ives Re-
ward : the show drew last position in the
waiting list.. From 231 tons got from the
crosscut at 69ft. in the No. 3 shaft the plates
gave 1160 z,, six tons concentrates averaged
soz. 6dwt., and nearly is in the tails.
The average value of the parcel was 16dwt.
As the bulk of the stuff was taken over the
full width of the crosscut (35ft.), the direc-
tors now proclaim that results “reveal a fine
body of payable ore.” Six months ago N. E.
Giblin told of 17dwt. stuff on the Main lode,
and since his report most work has been
done there. Recently there was another
sampling by A. J. Hill. He sums up the
Blue lode as “an aux-iliary to the ore reserves
by producing a fair tonnage of low-grade
ore,” and definitely places the Main lode as
the mainstay of the property. Three shafts
are down on it, Nos. 3, 4 and 6, and “on
the supposition that the ore so far developed
in the triangular block between these shafts
represents a long make,” 30.000 to*** “m«y
reasonably be expected” down to 118 ft., the
average value in the crosscuts be : ng 12dwt.
He considers indications favorable for the
development of a considerable tonnage, and
thinks that with “care, tact and persever-
ance” the Main lode has possibilities as a
div. payer. But they are only possibilities:
development has still a lone way to go.
The Reward will need to show something
big to justify its name. The original- venuois’
terms, Lke mme prospects claimed at the
beginning, have undergone considerable
cnanges. The amended purchase price was
£6<,060, to be satished by cash payments
of £15,500, £lO,OOO of debentures, 40,750
£1 fuliy-paids and 7500 shares paid to 3s.
(£ll2o). So far £B5OO of the cash has been
passed over, and the co. is to pay £2OOO in
September, £4500 more in March next year
and the balance of £5OO in September, 1023.
The debentures carry no interest, but are
redeemable at the close of 1924: but that
debt has been reduced to £BOOO by holders
quitting £2OOO worth of the paper for £544.
So by December, 1924, Ives Reward has to
find £15,000 for vendors. The share register
at the balance. (February 28) was made up of
104,100 £1 shares paid to 4s. and the 40,750
fuliy-paids, but another call has since
been responded to by all contribs. At the
balance 1(3026 had gone in development, and
working account showed a debit of £2OOO.
Rivei’ina South (W.A.) did not close down
without some excitement. The final clean-
up was watched lynx-eyed by the manager
of behalf of wages due to employees, includ-
ing himself, and by a representative of
debenture-holders specially despatched from
Melbourne. The mine is no bonanza, but
it is not so bad as its plant. With an effi-
cient plant something might be done with
the show.
“Talpa”: Theodore and Hughes have done
something sensible in appointing an outside
geologist at a cost not to exceed £5OOO to
examine the Roma district for prospects of
oil and natural gas. The country north-
wards up to the Divide, and a little beyond,
is jurassic, and has been laid down appa-
rently under fresh-water conditions. Strati-
graphically, the jurassic is nbt much of a
producer in other countries, with the excep-
tion, perhaps, of the Ural and Transcaspian
fields; but in this Maranoa district it con-
tains very large quantities of carbonaceous
material, which seems to affect favorably
the deposition of petroleum in some hitherto
unexplained manner. The deeper waters in
the district, as far as is known/ are alka-
line, and very few oil-wells, with the excep-
tion of some in the Rocky Mountain fields
(U.S.A.), are associated with this type of
water, which may open up new problems for
the geologist. Further north, on the Dawson
River, the carboniferous, which presumably
underlies the jurassic on the Maranoa, out-
crops, with marine beds, and this locality
may provide a more promising field to pros-
pect. The gas horizon at Roma offers some
possibilities. The transportation of this gas
great distances involves the testing of the
field for permanence, but the local treatment
for the extraction of the contained petrol
and the burning of the residual gas to the
finely-divided soot, known as “carbon black,”
involves only a comparatively small outlay.
Incidentally, it is interesting to note that
45,000,000.000 cubic feet gas was consumed
in the U.S.A. in 1920, producing 140,6081 b.
per day of an average value of 15 cents
per lb. Beeby Thompson, in a recent address
delivered before the members of the Institute
of Petroleum Technologists, held out hopes
of converting natural cns into industrial
alcohol, the estimated volume being one gal-
lon per 1000 cubic feet.

North Oswalds is on the market in
a small co. of £2500 in shares of £25 each,
W. F. Croft and B. J. Jackson, the
vendors, taking £2OO and 40 paid shares.
The ground is north of the Osum Ids mine,
Maldon (Vie.), out of which £1,750,000 worth
of gold has been won from the spur reefa and
droppers into the main Parkins reef. The
float has been prompted because in Oswalds,
between the SOOft. and 900 ft., the western
spur run of stone has been picked up. On rhe
new claim are the Junction shaft (1000 ft.),
the Cambrian (SOOft.) and Rewell’s
(200 ft.), so that half the job necessary to
test whether the western spur, reef makes into
the da ; m is done. The block has been idle
for 30 years, but altogether there is only
600 ft. of driving; so, if position be any-
thing, there is a good gamble in the show 7.

“Bendigonian” writes more history:—
Until a few years ago the field had the distinction
of haring the deepest gold-mining shafts in the
world. To-day it probably has the largest number
of shafts deeper than 3000 ft.; but there the dis-
tinction ends. Of them all there is only one in
which work is being done below 2000 ft., Koch’s
Pioneer, on the Garden Gully line.
The lowest depth at which pay-ore was won was
at 3000 ft. in the Victoria Quartz mine, on the New
Chum line.' The “saddle” located at this level re-
turned £96,000 in dividends. The workings were
continued to 4614 ft., ard several lodes were passed
through, but none of them was payable under the
costly working conditions pertaining to such a depth;
a small crushing from the lowest of all returned
about 7dwt. per ton. I shall never forgpt an inspec-
tion of the bottom level. The attire selected by the
manager was a scanty loincloth and sandals; in
one sense the cloth was superfluous—in another it
was quite inadequate, as one reallv wanted some
covering to save the skin from almost blistering.
What little water there was was nearly boiling;
the rock oa the sides and the iron pipes were un-
touchable, and the exhaust air from the machine
drills was stifling. Four-hour shifts were worked
towards the finish, and that was too much. It was
proposed to sink this shaft to 4800 ft. to intersect
on its pitch a lode cut by the New Chum Railway
(over a mile to the south) at 4154 ft. The work was
actually commenced, the Government undertaking to
supplement local contributions up to an aggregate
of £lO,OOO, if required, but the principal share-
holders withdrew their support, and the co. was
wound up.
A winze was sunk in the lode from 4100 ft. in the
Railway mine. It was a big formation, and crush-
ings of about 1000 tons yielded an average of 7.2dwt.
per ton. Of course, this was not payable, and was
not encouraging enough to justify further explora-
tion. Had the return been three times as much
there might have been an inducement for Bendigo
enterprise to assert itself. It would have meant
an outlay of at least £50,000 in cutting down the
old shaft or sinking a new one. At best it would
have been a risky undertaking. One payable saddle
formation would not have warranted it; and for some
reason which geologists and mineralogists cannot in-
dicate, Bendigo saddles have not shown any continu-
ous succession of payableness. One cannot under,
stand why the Government and the co. did not
arrange to put down a diamond-drill bore through
at least two of the deeper saddles. Surveyors could
have fixed the position and dip of a bore almost to
exactitude. Even a negative result would have been
valuable as settling definitely that there was an end
to hope.
In the Extended Hustlers between 2000 ft. and
3300 ft. 12 saddles were intersected, some in vertical
and some in parallel sections, and only one was
payable. In the famous Lazarus mine a saddle at
850 ft was payable; thence to 1630 ft. there
were seven saddles, all unpayable; at 1750 ft.
there was one which was described aa “good”;
others at 1790 ft. and 1837 ft. were “poor,” and at
1890 ft. and 2000 ft. there were formations which
were “very good.” A remarkable feature of the
2000 ft. formation was that the gold was very coarse.
There are still extar.t beautiful specimens showing
specks in solid quartz which would weigh several
pennj'weights. After that 1000 ft. of sinking re-
vealed nothing payable; there was no change in
the characteristic rock formations or in the almost
regular occurrence of the quartz saddles, but there
was almost a total disappearance of gold.
Revertirg to the richness of 600-700 ft. forma-
tions, the most extensive ore-body and the greatest
yield of gold from any one formation is claimed
by the Garden Gully line from a saddle which tra-
versed a group of mines (of which G. G. United,
Pandora and Victory were the chief producers at
600 ft. to 700 ft. In the G; G. United alone it was
worked for 646 yards, and produced 13 tons of gold.
Another example of the abnormality of 600 f- is
the Constellation, the bonanza from which has kept
the B.A.G. afloat. To date the co. has treated
45,000 tons from it for 65,0000 z., but the bonanza
is almost exhausted, the weekly return now being
only about lOOoz. For 40 years up to 1914 the old
Constellation Co. had been working continuously
without being able to declare a dividend; some'
oasual prospecting in that year in “centre country”
(which previously had not been touched) disclosed
the rich reef which has been worked evpr since.
An additional example of the 600 ft. bonanza rule
is the Central Blue, which 10 to 12 years ago was
the sensational show of the field.
The obvious moral is that attention should be
paid to further exploration of the shallower zones
which were neglected when the craze for deep-sink-
ing set in.

King Island Seheelite lias breathed its
last after a long illness. Mining operations
ceased in July, 1020, with seheelite at 30s.
a unit. A staff of four was retained, pre-
sumably to keep the plant ready in case of
a rise in price, but with funds getting low
and metal at 11s. the auctioneer was called
in the other day. Houses which cost about
£4OO brought £5O, and tools were acquired
by the local cocky and prospector at very
low prices. Under Venn Brown's manage-
ment the mine had a good run for three
years during the war period. There is still
a large body of ore in sight, and abundant
wood and water; and should tungsten prices
move up in the future the property will no
doubt receive attention.
A syndicate has been formed to test
Jack's Hope, 50 miles north of Inverell. This
show was discovered by a selector named Jack
Irwin, who sank a 50ft. shaft on a lode
chiefly tourmaline. Some good assays were
claimed, but the show failed to attract any
interest during the war years.

Speck geologist Hills has run the rule over
the Preolenna coal deposit, and formed a
high opinion of it as a gas- and oil-producer.
Five seams running to 2ft. wide are avail-
able, and the apnroximate coal in sight 1a
estimated at 5 000 000 tons. The calorific
value is 14,000 8.T.U., and gas production
12.000 cubic feet per ton. It is a good cok-
ing coal, although a sulphur content of up
to 5 me. is a drawback. Preolenna is the
only gaseous coal discovered in the Speck so
far, and if the tonnage is right the island’s
gas-works may become independent of the
N. S. Wales coal barons.

North Mt. Farrell (Tas.) continues to
respond to development at depth. In No.
6 level north Oft. of high-grade milling ore
is exposed, and in the south end 15ft., with
hands of prill ore. The stopes above No.
5 are averaging a width of lift. The March
output from 1*93 tons crudes was 205 tons
concentrates and 37 tons firsts.

Tor many months Mt. Jasper (Tas.i has

Recent reports give the lode as 2ft. wiue,

The old £2O shares were recently increased
to £3O, with a calling power of 2s. (id. per
month. Persistency such as this co. has
shown deserves better returns, but unfor-
tunately it is operating in a district notori-
ous as a stringer. Shipments of ore have
been made from development, and stoping
may possibly keep the wolf away; but the
location of the mine requires a large, strong
body of ore to give profits.

About 18 men are employed pitting and
boring on Badak’s option, the Brookstead
(Tas.), and mine-manager Miller has been
called in to sort out the grade of the wash.
It is rumored that values are not bearing out
“prospects.” The option expires shortly,
and, as The Bulletin anticipated when the
proposition was offered, it is unlikely that
Badak will purchase at the price.

The long-looked-for source of the gold won
from the alluvials in the Lisle basin (Tas.)
appears to have been found. Two prospec-
tors have unearthed three formations consist-
ing of a sandstone and quartz gangue of a
combined width of 40ft., and said to show
gold freely in the capping and detritus. A
small syndicate of 100 £lO shares, known as
the Little Molly, is being formed to open up
these formations, which are favorably situ-
ated for cheap work.

The late Jim McGowen used to tell how
the boys of his day journeyed out to
the now-crowded Redfern to gather geebungs,
how, tired on the way back, a score of
the youngsters would rush the back step of
a ’bus where two could with difficulty hang
on, and how once the two 'fortunates had got
seated the rest would yell in chorus to the
driver. “Whip behind.” That was largely
Jim’s experience through life, for, Labor’s
struggling days over, there was always some-
one close at his heels seeking his position.
And someone mostly got it. too, for McGowen
was a poor hand at intrigue.
J. 11. Cann. N.S.W. Railway Commis-
sioner, will be lonelier for the death of .Tames
McGowen. Jack was a miner and .Tim a
boiler-maker when they found themselves in
Parliament together 31 years ago as mem-
bers of the new Labor party. There was.
they soon discovered, a lot in common be-
tween them apart from their politics—both
were “teetotal,” and both keen on their
church-work: Jim was superintendent of
Canon (Archdeacon) Boyce’s church at Red-
fern for over 25 years. They saw so many
changes in their party that only they and
GEOROE WILLOUGHBY, who used to
be Hugh Ward’s theatrical partner.
The drawing shows him, in his latest
part in a J.C. W. “Babes in the Wood”
pantomime.
Alf Edden were at last left; and Edden
wasn’t continuously a member. Naturally,
when the Premiership came McGowen’s way
there was anything for Cann that he cared
to have. For a time he preferred to be
Speaker; but presently he took office as Trea-
surer. They both saw .changes coming which
promised them no good. Jim, however,
wouldn’t believe that" Redfern would throw
him out. Cann, always longer-headed than
his friend, would take no chances with
Broken Hill, and accepted a vacant Railway
Commissioner’s chair. Many years ago the
two had settled down alongside one another
in Palace-street, Petersham; and it was
there the ex-leader of the N.S.W. Labor
party died on Friday—suddenly, of heart
disease ; he had been under sentence of death
for seven years or more.
Gone at last from the pastoral and com-
mercial life of South Aus., Peter Waite, at
close on 88. He came from Scotland in 1859
and went up-country at once. He was there
while the great firm of Elder-Smith was
being founded, but later he had a big interest’
in the co. into which it grew, and till ill-
health lately intervened he was chairman of
directors, in pastoral ventures the old firm
was Elder and Waite, with Waite as man-
aging director. In the Far North he made
good use of camels and donkeys, both of
Elder’s importing, and the first camel to go
to Westralia came from their herd. All three
men built themselves mansions at the foot
of the hills behind Adelaide, Elder at Glen
Osmond, Barr Smith at Mitcham, and Waite
in the open country between. The last-
named gave all his estate there to the Uni.
in 1913, subject to the tenancy of himself
and Mrs. Waite. It will be used mainly for
agricultural study. As it happened, on the
very day of his death the Government an-
nounced that this year’s estimates will pro-
vide for an agricultural high school, so that
city youths with a fancy for the land hiay
know something of it before going on to
serious studies at Roseworthy. Further, like
the practical Scotchman that he was, Waite
realised that the land alone might be a kind
of white elephant to the University, and he
put in trust about £60,000 worth of shares
in Elder, Smith and Co. to provide an income
for running it. Of his two sons, one died
just before the war, the other lives in Eng-
land.
Just dead in London, W. N. Willis, who
made a distinct if somewhat smudgy mark
on the political and pastoral history of N. S.
Wales. He sat in six Parliaments for
Bourke and The Barwon (1888-1904), and
was the last of the quartette who in its early
days ran Truth, the other three being A. G.
Taylor, John Norton and W. P. Crick. The
“Jand scandals” drove Crick and Willis
from politics. In early life Willis was on
the stage, and for a while was a minor mem-
ber of the Creswick Co. Health reasons sent
him back to the country—he was a Mudgee
(N.S.W.) native—where he became first a
hawker and then a storekeeper in backblocks
townships. Twelve years ago lie went to
London, where, with his son, he ran a pub-
lishing business which featured “white
slave” books and similar stuff. A widow,
son and six daughters survive him. B g,
bluff Tom Willis —“Milrdy” of Sydney Mail
—is a brother.
Vic. Upper House is in mourning for
Drysdale- Brown,, who was:, its Chairman of
Committees. From the close of last session
he suffered acutely fromV heaxt' trouble,* and
his passing caused little surprise. He was
a politician of no great capacity, but he hap-
pened to be a lawyer—one who didn’t prac-
tise, because he had no need to—and that
helped him into office. He was Attorney-
General in the Murray and first Watt Gov-
ernments, was Minister of Mines, Forests and
Health in Watt’s second Cabinet, and stayed ,
on in the Peacock Ministry that followed.
Though a good Australian and thoroughly
well meaning, he was a thorn in the side of
every head of department and senior officer
with whom he had to deal, because he was
so fussy. Afraid of being regarded as a
rubber-stamp, he fumbled with everything,
and hadn’t enough time for essentials. But
he exhibited courage and determination at
times, and did good work for Australian
timbers and the preservation of fine natural
scenery. A bachelor, he lived in an old-
fashioned house at Punt-road, South Yarra.
A brother, a Maoriland M.P., makes Napier
his home town.
When Hughes told H. Maloney, secretary
of the Ship Painters and Dockers’ Union,
to “go to blithering blazes,” the deputation
that was with Maloney felt that it was
almost like old times. Certainly the “blither-
ing” part .was wrong: it usedn’t to be
“blithering.” Billy probably recognised this
himself, for,, after a few seconds pause, he
added a few words and phrases which the
reporters have never learned to write: in
shorthand. Then he cleared out of the
room and left the deputation, to follow when
it was ready—“just like he used to when he
was our emperor,” one of them chuckled.
For it is rubbish to say that the deputation
was hurt. Nobody else enjoyed it half so
much. .
Passed out in Melbourne, at 85, Francis
Jolly, one of the old-time Cousin Jack min-
ing cap’ns. - In his 65 years in Australia he
became a familiar figure on most fields, lie
was managing the old Victoria at Clunes
(Vic.) at 21, and after that Ballarat, Chew-
ton, Castlemaine and Glen Wills all saw him
directing operations for various cos. Nyma-
gee (N.S.W.) and Broken Hill also knew
him—he managed the Junction —as well as
Mt. Lyell and Zeehan (Tas.). In later
years he did much reporting for Melbourne
mining men. The old cap’n was badly hit
in the boom-smash, but he died comfortably
off. His wife predeceased him by 13 years,
and members of his large family include the
Rev. F. Jolly, of Essendon (Vic.), and
Charles Jolly, accountant of Macßobertson’s,
Sydney.
“Hamer” on some N. S. Wales casualties:
E. S. Carr, who mislaid his gold pass in Cumber-
land, left the chair of the Orange Leader in 1907
to down old Syd Smith, the Reidite member for
Macquarie. He was the first to be expelled from
the Labor party as a conscriptionist. Jack Doyle,
rejected of Balmain, was secretary of the Sydney
Assistant-secretary J. CAMPBELL, of the
Broken Hill Prop.
Eight Hours Committee after Jack Travers became
an M.L.C., and has been for 15 years one of the
most prominent Trades Hall identities. Simon
Hickey inherited the Alexandria seat from his
father-in-law, Dacey. “P.R.” and an adverse tram-
way vote had most to do with his downfall. He is
a thriving leather-goods manufacturer. Frank Dwyer
(late of Eastern Suburbs) was .nominated, tci .fill a death
vacancy. In Tory Woollahra, the popular Latimer,
once beat him by only 49 votes on the second -ballot.
A. E. E. V. Reid, of Manly, whom Arthur’s pocket
borough has flung out, was noted in the last State
Parliament for the strength of his voice, hair and
Jingoism. He had few other assets, but was included
in the Nationalist nomination because it was said
that, though not well-off, he spurned Labor offers
of the Speakership when there was trouble with
Levy. Gardiner, of Newcastle, who consistently
voted Labor after the party had biffed him, is also
amongst the slain. Most of the old hands who.
went out at previous elections and tried to-get baek
were directed to remain in private life. An excep-
tion was Mark Morton (Wollqndilly), whom Fuller
bore to victory, on his back.
No more fitting place could be found for
Web Gilbert’s bust of Alfred Deakin than
the library of Federal Parliament House,
where it is to be given a niche. When he
was a young Victorian politician this wing
of Parliament House had a strong fascina-
tion for him, and it never lost its charm.
W. M. llannay, who died at Wellington
(M.L.) the other day at 73, was one of
the Dominion’s first three Railway Commis-
sioners—he had previously been assistant-
genera 1-manager at Wellington. When the
Commission was dissolved he became man-
ager for the Wellington and Manawatu
Railway Co., but on the Government buying-
out the co. he left railway work for good,
.and was thereafter a busy director of nearly
a dozen trading concerns.
“Law”: Jimmy Blair, the latest tempera-
mental appointment to the Bananaland
Bench, was the democratic Minister who
retrenched Steele Rudd after 20 years’ clerk-
ing in the department. Rudd used to say:
“He wanted £2OO a year to save the country
from disaster, so he fired me on a Christmas
Eve at three weeks’ notice —with no pension ;
no thanks; no extra fiver to buy the kids
a Christmas box; not even a parting tear.”
R. Moodie-Heddle, skipper of the new
Commonwealth liner Hobson’s Bay, who pro-
mises to stand no nonsense from the Sea-
men’s Union, used to be the head of the
Vie. training-ship John Murray, but with
his usual luck was somewhere else when
the old vessel was wrecked off Malden Island.
During the war the Carnage, Barunga and
Ivapunda were torpedoed soon after the burly
Hedclle had left for other ships, and also
in his windjammer days he dodged an immi-
nent meeting with Davy Jones. In the early
’nineties, when he was about half his pre-
sent self, he served on the crack clippers Mer-
merus, Loch Carron, Romanoff and Loch
Nevis, and in 1906 commanded the flier Loch
Ness, which travelled from Melbourne to
Hull in 79 days, and later beat that achieve-
ment by covering the journey from Glasgow
to Melbourne in 76 days. The ancient Ness
is now a coal hulk in Fremantle Harbor,
and its former commander probably saw it
when he called in the other day. The equally
burly W. H. Traill, who shared with Archi-
bald some of the early trials of The Bulle-
tin, belonged to the same clan.
Ip many respects Scott Fell’s good win
for North Shore in the N.S.W. election was
the most notable of the whole feampaign.
Other “independents” won, but most of
them did it either on the sectarian issue or
with the help of a sympathy vote—as in
the case of Ashford in Wammerawa and
Ratcliffe in Botany. Fell set out as an
opponent of pre-selection, and won his place,
partly bv an extraordinarily vigorous can-
vass and partly by his reputation as a
successful business man, and without the
heln of any large amount of personal popu-
larity.
Harry Gullett went straight back to jour-
nalism from his immigration job. He is
writing political articles for the no longer
“neutral” Melbourne Hebald, which is
adding rapidly to its strength in view of
the coming struggle with the Sun.
Barwell has received 150 applications in
Britain from folk wishing to run the Sous-
tralian railways. He naturally would.
Arthur Robinson, Vic. Attorney-General, met
much the same lot when he got to London
a couple of years back. One of them was
a signalman, who growled that he had never
been given a chance to prove himself.
Gone to his last claim, at 80, George
Clarkson, discoverer of the famous Shotover
reef at Thames (M.L.) in 1867. He was
right down and had decided to move else-
where when he casually uncovered the reef
with his pick. Clarkson and his mate Hunt
each got a comfortable fortune out of the
find, which temporarily emptied Auckland
and took 6000 gold-seekers to the Thames.
By the defeat of Richard Atkinson Price
for Oxley the N.S.W. Assembly loses a
figure familiar there for 27 years. The little
tailor with the tangled tongue was a force
to count with in the old Gloucester single-
seat electorate, but the Oxley area, extend-
ing from Raymond Terrace to Grafton, was
too big for him—many of the electors knew
not Dicky. He leaves the House a poor
man.
Customs-expert R. B. Curd is on his way
back to the Commonwealth after spending
several years at Australia House advising
British merchants exactly how much they
were expected to drop into the pockets of
Fisher, Watt, Cook and Bruce. Where Curd
is to fit into the scheme here is probably
puzzling him. A year ago he was supposed
to be booked for the sub-controller’s chair in
Westralia.
F. M. B. Fisher, ex-Minister for Customs
in Maoriland, once the idol of the Welling-
ton public, gave promise of becoming a
statesman under the aegis of Bill Massey.
But smarting
under a defeat, he
fled to England,
where, he met an-
other political set-
back. That seems
to have settled it:
he let go of poli-
tics and became a
fashionable tennis-
player at seaside
tournaments. He
is on the best
Riviera courts
every year, and
this season had for
a partner Lady
Sykes wife of
Major - General
Sykes, of the Air
Ministry, the only
daughter of Bonar
Law. They have
had some good
wins, too.

“Saaedi”; In our troop Bill was noted for
his total lack of nerves, yet on one occasion
he was deeply moved, and to a psycho-analyst
the circumstances may be of interest. It
was during an unpleasant stay in the Jordan
Valley, and our cook-house this day seemed
to be attracting most of Jacko’s shells. Bill
was mess orderly, and had just started back
from the cuddy witTi two dixies of stew
when a shell burst near by and enveloped
him in dust. He walked on a few yards
and another shell burst, closer this time. Bill
came on unhurt, but when he reached our
THE SCIENCE GRADUATE.
“When Jack passed me I gave him a geo-
logical survey.”
“A geological survey!”
“ Yes —the stony stare.”
lines his face was a study. In a voice that
trembled with emotion, he said: “It’s time
the heads shifted that cook-house.” “My
oath it is.” I said feelingly (I was next on
the list for mess orderly) ; “it’s a crook
possie all-right.” “Crook! I should sav it
was,” and a wail of anguish crept into Bill’s
voice—“look at the sand those shells shot
into the flamin’ stew!”
* .* .* • -
“Dr. Exul’s” unromantic bathroom epi-
sode :
Dr. Blank and I were discussing ways of dealing
with hysterical patients. “Worst case of mine,” he
said, “was a nurse of St. Sawyer’s Hospital who had
hysterics in the bath when I was superintendent
there. The matron told me they couldn’t stop her
struggles, and asked if I would come and treat her
at once. I replied that I couldn’t think of such a
thing. ‘Get her into bed first and then I’ll have a
look at her,’ I said. ‘But we can’t get her out of
the hath,' matron wailed ; ‘the , other nurses have
been trying for 20 minutes, and they are getting
exhausted, and she’ll knock herself about if she isn’t
restrained.’ There was nothing else for it, so 1
followed matron to the bathroom, lifted the patient
on to my knee, and spanked her in the old-fashioned
way. The treatment was effective, but she never
spoke to me again.” I didn’t believe him, but some
time afterwards I found that a friend of my wife
had been a nurse there during his regime, and I
asked her if he had ever had to treat a hysterical
nurse. She wag blushingly dumb, but later con-
fessed to my wife that she had been one of the party
in the bathroom at the time, and that the incident
was as blank nad described it.

“Gilpin”: I have a maiden aunt who re-
cently returned to this up-Cuuntry Ma State
Eden from Victoria. Asked the things
that chiefly impressed her, sfle replied tuat
Melbourne's religious feeling was wonderful,
She had even heard a merry-go-round’s
hurdy-gurdy playing “Nearer My God to
Thee.” As to Sydney, she best remembers
wanting to dispatch a wire in Oxford-street.
On entering the office she was confronted by
a queue of about 30 waiting to be attended
to. Tiring, she asked of the woman ahead
if she thought a wire could be got away
that day. “Madame,” was the reply, “you
are lined up with the old-age pensioners.”

“Coot” : Recent pars, about narrow escapes
recall “Happy I‘ascoe,” a very religious old
Methody miner of Ballarat in the ’eighties.
One day “Happy” was down a shaft with
two mates, when, after preparing for a blast,
he not.ced that one of the fuses had
“jumped,” which meant precipitating an ex-
plosion. There was room in the cage for
only two men, so shouting “You two chaps
haven’t repented; I’m prepared to die,” he
forced his mates into the cage and gave the
haul-up signal. The cage had just got out
of danger when the explosion came. The
two mates descended again fully expecting to
find “Happy” in small pieces; but the blast
had loosened a block of stone which, falling
edgeways, had effectually screened him
from the flying and falling debris. When
they found him “Happy” was on his knees
returning thanks for his “d’livrunce.”
* * * #
“Snell”: Bills is a sticker. Thirty years
ago he was a hopeful young actor appearing
with Rignold and Dampier at two Melbourne
theatres. Twenty years ago he was a door-
keeper at one of the houses. Then he was
stall-usher for a while, and after that we
came into occasional contact when he was
Cerberus at a stage entrance. More years
passed, and I one day saw a man pasting
theatrical bills on the hoarding at the
Albert Park railway station. It was
Bills. Bills continued as billsticker for
five years or more, and then disappeared,
to reappear as the man who stuffed dodgers
advertising suburban shows into my letter-
box. Avain I lost trace of him. but soon
found him attached to the largest drink
obtainable over a bar at a St. Kilda pub.
“Hello. Bills.” said I, “given up your conneo-
tion with the profess’on at last, have you?”
“I have not.” replied B : Hs decisively. “Mv
wife has the contract to scrub the So-and-So
Picture Theatre.”
*-# # •
“Tarwoona”: Please rush to my comfort
with the assurance that the cables can lie.
Recently one said that, owing to
the experience of the late war,
horses were being discarded by the
R.F.A. and motor transport sub-,
stituted. Where did they get that
experience? I can talk of France,
and there motor transport for artil-
lery would only have been a success
from the enemy’s point of view.
For months on the Somme and in
the Salient the darn things wouldn’t
have been able to get the guns intx>
range. When we advanced late in
’lB motor-drawn artillery could
never have kept up with us over
the rough country. Not that it
would have mattered, as the Boche would
have souvenired the lot in his advance.
* * * *
“0.D.”: House thieves grow utterly auda-
cious in Melbourne suburbs. They are rich
in resource, and when one trick stales switch
on another. The other day a motor-car drew
up at the garden gate of a well-to-do St.
Kildaite, and a brisk, well-dressed gentle-
man, carrying a small, -black bag, stepped
out and entered the villa. A few minutes
later the woman of the house confronted the
gentleman in the passage. “Excuse me.” he
said, “is this the midwifery case?” “No, it
is not,” was the ready reply. “Bless my
soul! I have been wronglv directed. lam
Dr. Banks. I was called by ’phone to an
urgent case at this number. You’ll excuse
me.” He hastened out, entered his car and
was driven off. He got away with over
200 pounds in jewellery and hard cash.
* * * * *
“Sixenate”: Sydney .has had a oueer but
unreported case in divorce, in which the
husband was moving on the rare ground of
non-consummation. The icicle of the second
part had a strong affection for him, and
apparently is a normal, healthy woman with
sport ng inclinations, and at one hme risked
her fife to rescue him from the surf. From
the time he determined to sunder the barren
bond she made almost passionate attempts
to secure a reunion, but alwnvs with a re-
When it came to facing the ex-
posure of. the divorce court, she agreed to
a separation, but even after the document'
was signed there was a final oassionnte scene
in the lawyer’s office, during which, the
strange woman made a plea for a platonic
union. Incidentally, a friend in the trade
says he knows of a case in which it was the
husband who had the aversion. In spite of
the fact that he lavished luxury on his wife
she went home to mother after two years
spent with a man who, in the words of the
vaudeville ditty, was “more like a friend
than a ’usband.”
HUSH!
HIM: “I hardly know wliat to attribute my good fortune to."
HER: “ Don't wake it up—neither do I.”
“Herodot”: Recently there have been
references in Papua to an exploration per
airship of the central areas of New Guinea
—that is, the tableland country in and
around the Kaiserin Augustin Ranged which
is practically inaccessible by any other
means. Just before the war the; German
Administration in Rabaul had completed
plans for an aerial survey of the central
rnounta'nous parts of its territory. The
chief obstacle to such a survey is that only
airships can be used, aeroplanes being out
of the question owing to the absence of
landing-places. The German idea was to
establish a temporary aerodrome at either
iMadang or Morobe, and from one of these
places to make two trips, giving special at-
tention to the tablelands, about which very
littP ’S known beyond that they are of great
fertilitv.

“Adelaide”: Come to us for texts. In
a recent prosecution of three men for con-
spiring to carry away goods from the whole-
sale grocery of D. and J. Fowler, which
charge they strenuously denied, Cleland.
K.C., quoted from Proverbs: “They shall
deliver thee from the net of the fowler.”
And almost at once the conversation got on
to Dyed Garments and a man who backed
him through hearing about him in church
the previous Sunday. This was a new one
to Judge Gordon, and the incident did not
close till the court Bible had been con-
sulted, and the text located in Isaiah
Ixiii, 1: “Who is this that cometh from
Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?”
“Norbell” The retort conjugal from the
Auckland Herald’s personal column. First
day:—
I will not be responsible for debts contracted in
mv. name. P. —, Parnell.
Next day:—
I wish to thank all kind friends and neighbors in
time of hunger. Mrs. P. —, Parnell.
“Chloe” : The question of Orpen’s “Sowing
New Seed” has cropped up again, the artist
blaming Adelaide’s prudery for having re-
jected his picture as “immoral.” But Adel-
aide did not reject it because of its immo-
rality. Apart from the distorted and aggres-
sive nudity of the central figure it might
well as a mural decoration for a Baptist
chapel. As a picture it is a striking example
of “what not to hang.” It should be burned.
But don’t let Orpen try to convince anyone
that Australians thought it an offence to
morality. If a nude woman were as ugly
as he portrays her we should have a wonder-
fullv moral world. She would cure a sex
maniac.
* ■ . * .* *
“The Moralist”: Here’s a narrow shave, a
coincidence and fine bravery all in one. Samp-
son Bray ard his mate were shaft-sinking
below the 22<Wt. level in the Virginia,
Eaglehawk (Vic.). Having bored and
charged, they lit up, and, jumning on the
bucket, signalled her awnv. Half-way up
to the level Bray’s mate fell off. There were
no brass'bands playing and none knew the
odds better than Bray, as it was his custom
to cut the fuses short. But reaching for the
line, he knocked “Stop,” then “Lower.” On
his way down he decided to pull the fuses,
then see to his mate. Groping about in the
water he found the fuses—all but two. There
was no time left to go up if he wanted to,
so he lifted his unconscious cobber over into
a corner and then flung himself prostrate
Upon him. The frantic winch-driver 60ft.
above stopped hollering to the mates when
the first shot blew his hat off. He counted
two shots—then jumped to answ-er the signal
“Haul up.” When they reached the level
Bray was the only one cut about. A few
years later his 18st. of SUperb manhood sur-
rendered to caibon-monoxide in the Mount
Lyell (Tas.) disaster.

“Light the Binnacle”: At Cooktown (Q.)
one morning in February, 1888, on the
barque Com padre, I was cleaning paint-work
at the break of the poop, when the red head
of my fellow-apprentice looked so tempting
that I let fly a Avet swab at it. But Captain
Mackay, the harbor-master, popped out of
the cabin scuttle at the moment and got the
swab in the neck. I didn’t wait to hear his
views on the subject. Many years after-
wards in Brisbane I had a vivid dream of a
naval funeral passing down Queen-street,
LEAVING IT TO HIM.
THE PARSON: “But or- which of the ladies
are you going to marry?”
JACK : “I can't make up me mind. Which
would you?”
and in the dream was trold .by a bystander
that it was the funeral of. Captain Mackay,
then harbor-master of Brisbane.... The first
thing I saw on opening my- Courier next
morning was an account of Captain Mac-
kay’s death. I had not spoken to him nor
about him for 10 years at least. Did he in
his last moments recall the Cooktown inci-
dent? I cannot-think of it as a mere coin-
cidence.

GREY STOCKING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The sky is grey, and grey’s my mood,
And all the world seems grey to me.
The fickle goddess I have wooed
Flaunts her so cheap inconstancy.
About my heart the grey despairs,
All grim and leathern-winged, are flocking.
Grey ice about my heart. Who cares? —
Ten feet away is one grey stocking!
Though grey my mood, the stocking shows
Deliciously the limb within it;
Through the smooth grey it coos and glows—
I’m half consoled in half a minute.
So grey my mind, so grey the day,
You’ll think it somehow very shocking
To find such comfort come my way—•
But you have not seen that grey stocking.
It’s coolly grey as ashes are
Sometimes near where the hottest fire is;
Grey as regret (though sweeter far),
Grey as a virgin angel’s iris.
A singing grey it is that prods
Me through with its insistent mocking.
It thrills me so, I thank the gods
Who filled so well that dear grey stocking!
Oh, la! la! la! my mood is gold.
Pan’s pipes set all the earth a-rockimg.
No more Pm weary, sad or old —
I am the slave o\j One Grey Stocking t
N.S.W.

“Digbine”: I did not see the Hun woman
mentioned b.v “Tarago” (B. lt>/2/’22), but I
did see a Fritz female in uniform, and quite
dead, in August, ’l5, between Mailly Mailly
and Forceville (Somme area). I was,
through no fault of mine, a Tommy in a
Woodbine regular regiment. The Boche lady
was in the observer’s seat of an aeroplane
shot down by one of our birdmen. The Hun
pilot was also dead—he did the last 1000 ft.
or so on one wing. I was in the rush to
view the wreckage, and as Mrs. Boehe’s
hair had tumbled down, and as the Tommies
souvenired most of her uniform, there was
no doubt as to her sex. I was the only
Aussie in that regiment, but I think Stan-
ley Wootton would remember the incident,
as he was near by.
* * * *
“Gregor”: London papers have lately re-
vived the old stories of girls being “doped”
by “white slavers” in crowded streets, the
method of the doper being to sidle up along-
side his victim and insert in the flesh of her
bare arm the needle of a hypodermic syringe
tilled with cocaine solution. Some Austra-
lian papers have reprinted these yarns, and
the natural reflex was seen in Melbourne a
few days ago when an 18-year-old girl
reported that, while walking along a busy
street, she had felt a .sharp pricking in one
arm, and on turning round had observed a
“dark, foreign-looking man” (they are always
dark and foreign-looking) hurrying away.
Shortly afterwards, she said, a drowsiness
crept over her, and it was with difficulty
that she got home. And some people be-
lieved the story. As a matter of fact,
cocaine does not produce drowsiness —rather
the contrary. Then it would be about as
easy to give a girl a hypodermic injection
without her knowledge as it would be to
draw one of her teeth. The first sponsor
of this yarn was Australia’s old friend Nick
Willis, who set it out in his book. “White
Slaves in London,” about 12 years ago. Since
then it has been cropping up at intervals,
and there’s always someone to swallow the
foolishness.
* * * *
“Tauwarra”: “Crow-eater” (B. 2/3/’22)
may not have heard of white men getting the
cat for interfering with native women in
New Guinea, but he has probably come
TAKING EVERY PRECAUTION.
HER FINANCIER : “You haven’t forgotten,
dear, that for business reasons our en-
gagement must be kept a secret?”
HIS FIANCEE : “Oh, no, I’m telling every-
body that.”
across unfortunates who have “done time”
for abducting village Flossies. The law
applies both to Brown Brother and his white
boss, and it is to the credit of the Papuan
Government that it administers it without
regard to coloi\ The Government should
go a step further and regulate so-called
“New Guinea marriages.” The degenerate
Combo who takes a native “wife” and loafs
on the village community for the rest of his
days is far too common in recent years, and
his evil influence has more to do with the
demoralisation of the native than all the
movies and illustrated papers. Drastic regu-
lations to deal with these wasters would go
far towards re-establishing the waning pres-
tige of the white man, the task of govern-
ing Brown Brother would be simplified, and
our women-folk could be left alone without
fear of insult at the hands of night-prowl-
ing niggers.
COULDN'T OBLIGE HIM..
THE ARTISTIC ONE (slightly excited) : “Ah,
there's b-e-a-u-tiful Miss Watsis! In-
troduce me to that combination of
woman and angel. Unlock for me the
door of hope."
THE COMMERCIAL ONE: “ Can't do it, old
man; haven't got the key."
“Malua”: The Governor of American
Samoa is original, to say the least of him.
Recently on his travels a deputation of
native chiefs waited on him with a request
that the U.S.A. pass over the place to some
other country, as they were very dissatis-
fied with the present Government. The Gov-
ernor told them that America was a bit fed-
up, too, and gave them an hour to decide
which country they would be handed over to.
In less than half the time they realised that
their bluff had been called, and the whole
thing ended there.
* * * *
“Cartot”: In correcting “Coot” for his
mistake as to the whereabouts of Gun-alley,
“1t.8.C.” (B. 10/3/’22) wonders why the
murderer passed
the small, dark
lane on the right
of the Arcade and
risked being seen
by the proprietor
of a near-by doss-
house, in order to
r each the alley,
further along the
street. In the
alley is the trap of
a large sewer. An
inspection just
after the bodv had
been found showed
that unsuccessful
attempts had been
made to open this,
and there is little
doubt that the
murderer’s inten-
tion had been to throw the corpse down this
manhole.
*** . *
“Veronal”: An Australian peerage was
first mooted in the sixties of last century. It
received little encouragement from the press,
and Dan Deniehy, in the Southern Cross,
pilloried those who were believed to aspire to
honors. The would-be hereditary legislators,
according to him. included John Macarthur,
whom “nothin? less than the strawberry
leaves -would satisfy,” and William Charles
Wentworth, who was cast for a dukedom. For
Parkes no title was suggested. When the Bri-
tish Government gave the childless John For-
rest a peerage it limited the barony to “him
and the heirs of his body.” Robert Tooth’s
baronetcy, on the other hand, does not be-
come extinct through lack of male heirs, but
descends through the male children of his
eldest daughter, who married an army officer.
* * * ♦
*‘X2X”: If there is anything in the re-
searches of a Parisian medical man named
Apert we are within measurable distance of
being able to control the sex of an unborn
child. He came to the conclusion, after
exhaustive inquiries, that the birth of male
children can be
secured by the admin-
istration of small and
gradually increasing
doses of adrenalin, a
body of definite chemi-
cal constitution exist-
ing naturally in the
suprarenal capsules.
He experimented ac-
cordingly, with what
is described as “start-
ling successes.” Then
he worked it out that
choline, the pharma-
cological opposite of
adrenalin, should re-
sult in the birth of
female children ; and
again his experiments
bore out this conclu-
sion. He admits his
researches are not yet
conclusive, but sums
up the present posi-
tion with the state-
ment that if a pros-
pective mother wishes
her child to be a boy,
she should spend
plenty of time in phy-
sic a 1 exercise, eat
little and never to the
extent of her appetite,
and take every day a
hypodermic injection
of one milligram
(0.015 grains) of
adrenalin. Conversely,
should she wish a
daughter, she should
get fat, eat plenty of
nourishing food,
abstain from exertion,
avo ; d fatigue and take
a. daily injection of choline. In this way
she will increase enormously her chances of
getting what she wants.
“Jobber”: The next time Gladys Owen
goes painting at Parramatta warn her away
from old Experiment Cottage, near the Eliza-
beth Farm which she has put on canvas.
It would make her shudder, as it made me, to
see it now. A speculator has bought the old
place and re-christened it Canberra, and, I’m
told, intends subdividing the estate in build-
ing blocks. No one looks for sentiment in
land-speculators, but the Government should
see that these historic places are preserved..
They’ll be demolishing old Government House
in Parramatta Park next. Hasn’t the ancient
residence at Windsor (N.S.W.) gone west
already ?
* * * *
“Exul”: The home of one of Hobart’s
oldest institutions, Walch’s book store, has
just been purchased by a Melbourne firm,
and in six months’ time “Walch’s Corner”
will hav.e ceased to exist, and the business
will be carried on elsewhere. The first build-
ing on the site (the corner of Elizabeth
and Liverpool streets) was the White Plorse
Hotel, started in the late ’thirties for Mr.
Lewis. In 1842 his daughter married Mr.
Tegg, a bookseller, and the pub was turned
into a bookseller’s shop. Three years later
the business was acquired by Major J. W. H.
Walch, and when, shortly afterwards, his
son was admitted to partnership, the firm
took the name of J. Walch and Son, which
it has retained to this day.
* * * *
“Pink Tape”: Some time ago the residents
of Ironpot Creek, near Ivyogle (N.S.W.),
deciding that the name wasn’t classy enough,
applied to have it changed. Hearing nothing
from the authorities, they concluded the
matter had been mislaid or something. Then
the other day a school-teacher drifted into
Ivyogle looking for a place called Oakburn.
Nobody, not even the police, knew of such a
town, but a wire to Sydney proved that this
was the new designation of Ironpot Creek.
It has not yet been explained why the Syd-
ney Departments concerned kept the matter
such a dead secret. Maybe they were
ashamed of the name they had fastened on
the unoffending Australian kid.
“Jim Carew”: There is a real life story of
the early days on the N.S.W. South Coast
which outdoes Tennyson’s “Enoch Arden.”
A young girl had married an elderly pros-
pector and had borne him two children when
he started off to a new rush. Three months
later his wife received news that he was
dead. Within a year she married a young
farmer. Seven years went by; then one day
her original husband, now a broken old man,
turned up. He had been mining in America
and had sent her word (which she never
received) of his intention of going there.
Instead of raising a rumpus, the old chap
took a sensible view of things and lived
in the house as an odd-job man until his
death about a year later. The surviving
couple were then secretly re-married. I
don't think a soul in the district was aware
of the identity of the old man who died on
the farm.
* * * *
“Cartot”: “Paudh’s” reference to the
Auckland painter (B. 9/3/’22) who was
arrested a few minutes before the scaffold
upon which he had been working collapsed
and killed his four mates, recalls an inci-
dent in a North Queensland coastal town.
An embezzling bank clerk tried to get away
by steamer, but was arrested just as he was
going aboard. The vessel was the Yongala,
and after she steamed out of port nothing
was ever heard of her. What puzzles me
about that business is why Providence went
to the trouble of saving a levanting criminal
and let a large number of perfectly honest
people on the ship go to a mysterious death.
“James Jampot” on killing machines:—
All sensible Light Horse regiments would have
gladly carried a double complement of machine-
guns and could easily have done so, the ammunition
difficulty being surmountable by presenting each
trooper with an extra 200 rounds. A similar method of
transporting ammunition was frequently, and with suc-
cess, adopted by the infantry in France during the
last big chase back to the Hindenburg line. As to
the comparative usefulness of m.-g. and rifle in any
Phase of war, I say, as a man who has handled both,
that the machine-gun wins hands down. For sniping
the Vickers gun stands alone; the “personal ele-
ment’’ is largely eliminated, owing to the gun being
mounted on a tripod, which ensures steadiness of
aim—and in sniping that is nine-tenths of the job.
In defence the Vickers gun, thanks to its volume of
fire, is worth at least 50 rifles, while the Lewis
machine-gun (or automatic rifle) is worth at least
30 ordinary rifles. In attack, I admit, the Vickers
is unwieldy; but the Lewis is an ideal instrument. To
most of us, speaking frankly, the rifle was a piece
of wood and metal that made the bayonet feel com-
fortably longer.
* * * #
“Te Pana”: Nothing has been done to
indicate by way of memorial what the Bay
of Islands stands for in relation to the
early history of the Shaky Isles. At Paihia
there is what little is left of the earliest
C. of E. mission station, and still visible are
the walls of the building in which the first
printing press in M.L. was set up. Not far
distant is Wajtangi, where in 1840 was
signed the famous Treaty between Hori and
the Pakeha. At Russeil there is the flag-
staff which is successor to the three that
were cut down by Hone Heke in 1844-45 at
the outbreak of the first serious trouble be-
tween Maoris and Europeans. The Angli-
can church in the village still bears marks
of shells fired from H.M.S. Hazard, and in
the adjacent cemetery are the remains of
the ship’s men who lost their lives in the
fighting. Not a line is inscribed anywhere
to indicate the historical nature of the spot.
DOING HIS BEST.
THE EDITOR : “ Where in thunder is Brown
with that matter we were to have by
noon?”
THE DEVIL : “Please, sir, he is in the pub
trying to type it on the cash-register."
“Lexite”: The Third Degree is not sup-
posed to be allowed in Australia : but it is
practised all right. Through failure to be
careful of his company a man I know became
suspect, and had seven separate charges
brought against him by the police. He was
acquitted on each charge, but his defence
cost him £lOO, besides time. One day be
was taken' to the detective office and kept
there for seven hours while the demons ques-
tioned and badgered him in an endeavor to
get him to incriminate himself. The police
always, of course, deny charges of using the
third degree, and prisoners making them have
no witnesses; but their frequency lends
color to the allegation that accused men on
many occasions are tortured into making con-
fessions.
AN APRIL MORNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hear the yapping of a fox,
The little stream goes down the rock*
In sudden gushes;
And a hidden lyre-bird merrily mocks
The good grey thrushes.
The morning mist is fleecy blue,
My path is dark across the dew
On grass-spears bending ;
And I think the world has been made anew
To its silvery ending.
i
The peach trees drop their yellowing leaves ;
And the sun beyond the brown ridge heaves
A golden shoulder.
In the windless morning the spider weave.
And the wrens grow bolder.
Verandahs thud to unshod feet;
The grey home smoke smells keen and sweet;
The kettle’s boiling—
Though fools build cities where rogues may cheat
This world takes spoiling!

Florence Easton
on this month's
Brunswick Super- Feature
Records .
Each month, Brunswick releases from three to six
Super-Feature Records—the month’s best phono-
graphic music. The current release introduces two
great Metropolitan Opera artists, now exclusively
Brunswick —Florence Easton, soprano, and Giuseppe
Danise, premier baritone. Comment regarding the
importance of this announcement is unnecessary, both
of these artists being too well known in American
and European musical centres to require it.

Soprano High “C
Without “Metallic” Suggestion
A Brunswick Achievement Vouched for by Highest Musical Authorities.
99
Prices of Brunswick Phono-
graphs range from 25 gns.
Fourteen models in various
finishes, including authentic
period designs.
Musicians, critics, teachers, all will tell you the
severe test of a phonograph is in rendering “high
notes,” especially soprano.
Remember this when buying a phonograph, and
insist that soprano records be played.
Note then, how most instruments vibrate, sound
“metallic” when the higher notes are reached.
Then hear the same records on the Brunswick.
Hear the full range of “high notes.”’ Soprano
High “C” in ringing intensity, without slightest
“metallic” intrusion —clear-toned, vibrationless!
And you will marvel at difference so great in
phonographs.
Thousands have made it
Thousands of music lovers have made this com-
parison. And chosen the Brunswick.
Highest musical authorities have made it, with
the same result. So when one inquires, in the
world of musical art, which instrument is pre-
ferred, the number who say The Brunswick is
surprising.
And they say, too, that while any make of record
is sweeter and more beautiful on a Brunswick, the
ideality is attained with a Brunswick Record on a
Brunswick phonograph.
This is why
By means of exclusive methods of Reproduction
and of Interpretation, Brunswick achieves perfect
rendition of the so-called “difficult” tones —the
piano, the harp, the human voice. Methods which
apply to no other phonographs or records.
The Brunswick Method of Reproduction is
exclusively Brunswick. The Brunswick Method
of Interpretation, in producing records, has not
been successfully imitated.
Hence, buying any phonograph without at least
hearing The Brunswick, is a mistake. And to be
without Brunswick Records is to be without much
of what is best in music.
Ask your nearest Phonograph dealer for a demon-
stration. The Brunswick plays all records, and
Brunswick Records can be played on any phono-
graph. Hear, compare—then judge for yourself.

“Tuan Kechil”: “C. Coral’’ (B. 2/3/’22)
is evidently trying to describe what is known to
the natives and planters of the Malay Peninsula as
the chichak, pronounced “cheechar,” which well
describes the noise made by this house lizard. But
1 have never seen them four or five inches long;
they generally run to about 2in., and are shorter
after the periodical shedding of their stern. Perhaps,
however, “C. Coral’’ is referring to the gecko, which
makes a much louder and deeper noise and is about
9in. long. If a gecko condescends to live in your
house the Malays look on it as a sign of good luck.
MONSIEUR, MADAME AND TWO
MISSES.
MRS. RABBIT: "Oh, I’m so glad you’re home
again. I’ve missed you dreadfully."
MR. RABBIT: “ Thank you, my dear. And
those city sportsmen I met missed me
too."
“Malua” (Samoa): “Malaita” alleges (B.
12/1/ 22) that most of the trouble with rhi-
noceros-beetle is caused while the cocoanut-trees are
young, especially on the bush line, and that as they
come into bearing the damage becomes less and less.
All the damage I hav# seen in Samoa (and it is
considerable) has been in old trees that have been
bearing for years. I have just completed the destruc-
tion of 200 acres of cocoanut-palms, every one dead
and rotting, and not one of them attacked until it
was 20 years old and in full bearing. I will admit
that they were neglected during the war years, but
so were the young trees, and they remain undamaged.
Is it the same insect, or is “Malaita’s” beetle the
eleohant-beetle ? There is a difference.
“Jim Carew”: I recently shot the male
bird of a pair of sparrowhawks that had set up house-
keeping outside our fowl run. I expected the hen
bird to clear but; but a couple of hours later the
lady had secured another husband for herself, and
was carrying on her domestic affairs as usual. I
have often seen a male bird get another wife a couple
of hours after being made a widower, but this is the
only time I have known a female to secure a new
Johnnie. Any Abo. know how she managed it?
■» » * *
“H.V.E.”: Tell “Ophis” the diamond-
snake (Python spilotes) always collects its eggs into
a pyramid-shaped pile and coils affectionately around
them. The diamond, when incubating on the ground,
and not in a tree or log hollow, constructs a more
or less elaborate nest of dead leaves, bracken, bark,
etc. Stranger still, the heat of the female python’s
body rises during the incubatory period, and she is
thus enabled to assist the sun in hatching out her
soft-shelled eggs. The female brown- and whip-
snakes—also soft-shelled egg-layers—merely deposit
their cargo among dead leaves, rubbish, etc., lying
on the ground, and let the sun do the hatching.
* * * *
“Ishmael”: While up in the N.-E. corner
of S. Au 3. I looked out one morning to find the
fencing wires and trees festooned with spiders’
webs. Close investigation, however, showed no signs
of the spiders. The material had drifted over from
Queensland, and was as flimsy as a politician’s
piomise; but as it stood the bright light of day
without entirely vanishing I had to discard the
theory that that was what the stuff was made of.
* * * •
“Billy T.”: They had been talking about
the size of their cucumbers, and Beal got tired. He
was a visitor and did not grow cucumbers. “You’ll
excuse me fer changin’ the subjec’,” he said, “but
how are yeh on spuds here? 1 bin harvestin’ a few
acres, and I’m jest wonderin’ if there’s bigger per-
taters anywheres. I’ve lifted clusters of a dozen each
ez big ez a bucket, ’n’ some the size of tanks. But
on Wednesday mornin’ I struck one I couldn’t shift.
I dug all round it, ’n’ tried to mine under, usin’
timber, but it wasn’t no use. So y’ll see me adver-
tisement in this mornin’s Age.’’ “Why,” asked
Miller, “what are yeh advertisin’ fer?” Beal tapped
his pipe on the log. “Quarrymen,” he said.
* * * *
“Bent”: Two years ago I read in the
Abo. column about a lemon-tree not bearing any
fruit, and advising readers to cut the tap-root and
run a nail through the tree above the ground. I
tried the plan, and since then there has been fruit
on the tree nearly all the year round; while the
vegetables on some branches are half-grown other
branches are only flowering. But can any Abo.
now tell me why the fruit will not ripen?
* * * *
“Dossett”: “Burnett” casts a doubt (B.
9/3/’22) on the wisdom of using kerosene as a remedy
for sci üb-itc h. I used it after I had scratched my-
self raw, and felt no ill-effects. Of 16 men in our
camp who kerosened themselves not one complained.
Is it a case of one man’s meat being another man’s
poison ? I don’t doubt there are other remedies quite
as effective, but they are not so easily obtained—
and when a man gets scrub-itch the remedy can’t be
obtained too soon.
* * * •
‘lvilang” (N.T.) : Binghi’s relationships
would puzzle a second Solomon. Doubleup
comes from South Alligator. He has one
brother, Miranda, who is a Wangite.
Miranda also has a brother, Dick, who
is a Roper River native. But Doubleup
does not savvy Dick. “No more country-
man longa me,” he states. Old Piper is
Doubleup’s uncle, but Young Piper, who
is Old Piper’s son, i a Doubleup’s grand-
father. Doubleup tried to explain it all
to me once: “Milly him litt* bit mother
longa-me ; Kitty him full-up mother. Young
Piper him grandfather longa me; Alice
him wife longa Young Piper, him cousin
longa me, him full-up sister lorfji Old
Piper. Alice bin catchem little fellow
piccaninny; piccaninny him little-feller
sister lorga me, him harp [half] picca-
ninny longa Milly. Kitty no more savvy
him.” But Doubleup has a logic of his
own. He got a headache the other day,
and cut his forehead with some broken
glass “to let the pain get out.”
“Girofla”: Tell “Rojo” (B. 23/2/’22) that
the red-gum of the eastern States ( E. rstrata) is so
called because of the color of the timber. In
VVestralia, however, the red-gum (E. calophylla) gets
its name from the red, gummy kino exudate which
comes from fissures in the bark. The blue-gum (E.
saligna) at any rate, that near Sydney—is so named
on account of its smooth, blue-grey bark. E. saligna
is very widely distributed, and is found in four
States. Incidentally, the yellow box (E. mellio-
dona) has a bark that is grey outside but beauti-
fully yellow inside.
* * * *
“Animbra” (N.T.) : Where is Outback?
(B. 8/12/ 21). The result of the Melbourne Cup
came to me in The Bulletin which arrived on
December 29. The Christmas number (10/12/’2l)
landed here on February 8.
“L.F.8.” (New Britain) : Re “Nalla’s”
hermaphrodite hen (B. 29/12/’2l). They are very
common here on the island—too much in-breedi:g.
But I have something much funnier. One of my
young leghorn roosters is making gallant advances,
as “Nalla” calls it, to my black and white house-
cat.
“Pom Dig”: Frank Howson may have
put up a good record on a prad in 1885 (B.
9/3/’22), but he must have wandered off the track
a bit if he covered 221 miles from Booligal to Kil-
fera station (N.S.W.) and back. From Booligal to
Ivanhoe is 80-odd miles, and Ivanhoe to the Kilfera
GETTING ON.
“And how's your noo man now?"
Aw, a hit letter. If he had a few more brains I’d begin to think he was half-untied."
homestead is another 15, making a total of 95 miles
at the outside. But that’s a long way round. The
chances are he rode straight through Mossgiel to
Kilfera, via Gardenia—a total distance of 85 miles
at the outside, and making the double journey only
170 miles. But my knowledge of that part of the
world only dates back to 1913, and perhaps the
miles have lengthened since ’B5.
* * * »
“Longo”: “Steve Hart” is astray when
he says (B. 23/2/’22) that blowflies will not go up
more than 15ft. It is quite correct that they will
go down, as they have often been my only com-
pany at the bottom of a well, especially when fumes
of gelignite hung about. And I know at least two
cases of tall trees being felled for what appeared to
be lively bees’ nests, but which turned out to be
very dead ’possums and their attendant blowflies.
* * * *
“I. A. Dine” (Solomons) : I’m fed up with
the rabbit-cat controversy, so perhaps this will keep
the cabbit wranglers quiet for a spell. I bought a
Japanese eight-day clock. Till a short circuit
developed in the gear-box it moted well. Now, at
this moment, the little hand points to 6, the large
hand to 11, the chimes ring 2, and the correct
time is 25 minutes past 4. How can I leg-rope
the formula, and must I make allowance for refrac-
tion f
* * • •
“FY7”: “Bill R.’s” recipe for taming an
uncatchable neddy (B. 9/3/’22) will not improve the
prad's market value. Two feet of trace-chain and
a small log fastened to the gee's fetlock will probably
hamper his movements, but the gadget will ruin his
forelegs. There is no surer method of “stopping” a
racehorse than a smart rap on the shin with a ruler
the night before he races; and this chain-and-log
atrocity ought to quickly make a mess of any horse
for good and all.
« » * *
“I. R. Meek”: I have a good she?p-dog,
but he works too close to handle small mobs in
hilly country. A mate advises me to tie him to a
wether and let them go in an open paddock. I am
afraid this would end with a dead dog on my hands.
Has any Abo. seen the method tried?
“Macßee”: While out ’possum-shooting
with a mate at Bloomfield, in the Speck’s midlands,
we saw a black smudge 3ft. up a sloping gum-
stump. A shot brought the “ ’possum” down and
he turned out to be a platypus. The spot where
he was perched was about Bft. from the creek edge.
What was he doing up the stump? I have never
before heard of a platypus climbing.
* • • •
“Hibiscus”: Two wallabies, a buck and
a doe, were kept in a paling enclosure in a town-
ship on the North Coast (N.S.W.). The doe gave
birth to a young one, which died. Some time after-
wards the buck died, and presently the doe again
produced a young one, which did not long survive.
A few months later, without having seen another
wallaby in the meantime, she again gave birth to a
young one, normal in form and size, which lived
some time and then died. I know its owner, and
I have verified the details by reference to several
neighbors, all of whom swear the doe was alone
after her mate died. She is the only wallaby in cap-
tivity in the township, and the bush is miles away.
“Snell”: It was at Goldsborough, just
beyond Dunolly (Vic.), then a thriving mining town-
ship. I was the hawker’s boy; the hawker himself
was a very popular figure, the best quoit-thrower
among any ordinary hundred Cousin Jacks. One
Sunday afternoon Mulish went to Tommy where he
was playing; quoits in the hotel yard and begged
the loan of a pound till pay-day. Tommy complied,
and Mulish went away, whereat Tyneside Jack
reproached the hawker for a fool. “You’ll never see
that quid again,” said he. Late that afternoon we
noticed a crowd collected about the mouth of the Old
Pioneer shaft. We went across. Tyneside Jack pro-
vided the information. “Mulish has fell down,”
said he. Then, turning to the hawker: “I told you
he wasn’t to be trusted.”
* * * «
“Klaney”: Even a curly-tail doesn’t know
v/hat he can do till he has a try. Some years ago
at Wingham Show (N.S.W.) two drakes bagged
first prize as “best duck and drake.”
* * * #
“Hecagus”: Crossing the range from
Innisfail to Millaa Millaa (Q.) recently via the
late Christy Palmerston’s little-known track, I met
a tribe of nigs and asked one the time. Baring a
dusky forearm he displayed an old handless gun-
metal watch, then glancing up at the grey, sodden
sky he said': “I tinkit plurry near dark, boss.”
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
“Well, did you see them milk the cows,
dear?”
“ No—but I seen 'em UN-milk 'em!”
“Skyrider”: I have found a cure for sick
cats, and che chemist who sold me the stuff is still
scratching his head over it. Our old tabby was
smitten with a malady which threatened to leave her
bald, and when I decided to destroy her, the chemist
suggested cyanide. He gave me a lump big enough
to kill a horse, and I dissolved it in a little milk.
Tabby lapped it to the last drop. Unable to face
her in her death agony, I went indoors for half-an-hour,
and then came out to conduct the funeral. Tabby
waa seated in the sunshine, purring vigorously; and
inside a week she was her old self, her fur thick
and shiny.

FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The day was hot and thirsty when I came to Cooma
town,
And sought a friendly pub where I might keep a
cooler down.
Now, quite by chance I came upon a deaf surveyor—
one
Whom I had met in Kimberley on Durack’s cattle-
run.
This Jimmy Doyle, you’ll understand, had specialised
in drinlt.
“Aha!” said I, “the very man!” and gave myself
a witlk.
“Wiry, Jim, it’s you!” I roared at him. “The
weather’s pretty right!”
“My word!” he softly answered me. “We kept it up
all night!”
“/ said fh* day was good!” I yelled; and straightway
murmured he:
“It was a dinkum case, all right, my sino-vitis
knee!” * -»••
“Oh, blarst your sino-vitis knee!” I muttered to
the wall—•
I couldn’t make the blighter hear a single word at
all.
At last I struck a brilliant thought (I fairly ached
for beer) ;
I walked across the room to him and whispered in
his ear.
And what about a drink ?” I sighed. A sly surveyor
who
W r as absolutely deaf replied: “I don’t mind if l
do!”

“Tauwarra”: The Papuan authorities do
not encourage Brown Brother to array himself in
European clobber; so I was rather surprised when
a small native accosted me and said, “Taubada,
more better you givvum me one old fella pair ter-
rousers.” “Whaffor?” I barked, mindful of the law. •
“For nuttin, please,” he whispered pleadingly. He
got ’em.
“IT2S”: Tell “Gecko” fB. 2/2/’22) that
platypi thrive in the lower reaches of the Inglis
River (Tas.), which is tidal.
* * * *
“Count.i-y Ped”: “Golub’s” par. re a man
being poisoned (B. 16/3/’22) by standing bare-footed
on a dead snake’s head, reminds me of an old
Queenslander who always smashed the head of a
snake to a pulp. In his early digging days a mate’s
dog carried home the head of a recently-killed

crawler and placed it on the verandah. A baby girl
found it and began to play with it. When her
parents noticed her the head was thrown away ; but
the little one was dead within a couple of hours —
pricked and so poisoned by a fang, as the doctor
pointed out.
“Crooked Sam”: If “J.E.G/s” mare (B.
2/2/’22) has the kind of itch known to N.S.W.
North Coasters as mange, kerosene may cheik it for
a time, as suggested by “R.J.Y.” (B. 16/3/’22), but
I have never heard of a permanent cure. I once
owned a pony that was affected badly in both marie
and tail, and took him from the Richmond River to
POWDER AND PAINT.
“Gertie’s terribly puffed up!”
“Wouldn't mind that, but she’s so rouged up, too.”
Armidale. The itch disappeared almost at once
and did not show again during the three years I
remained in Armidale. Returning to the coast I
took the pohv along, and the itch reappeared the
next summer and remained with him till he died.
This , seems to suggest that climate has a lot to do
with it.
“Bendy”: Re narrow escapes (B.
30/3/’22). A picnic party in the Grampians (Vic.)
had dinner under a rocky ledge, and, on finishing,
decided to go for a stroll before packing up. A
couple of minutes later the ledge collapsed burying
their hampers under hundreds of tons of rock.
“Colub”: Most people think the bite of
the carpet-snake is per-
fectly harmless; but let
them get one good nip
and they’ll reconstruct
their views. The carpet's
front teeth—the ones which
do the most damage when
he takes hold of anything
soft —are long, thin and
curved back towards the
end; moreover, they have
a definite groove which,
duct-like, extends the
whole length. In biting,
these front teeth penetrate
the flesh as far as their
bases, so that when they
are withdrawn they leave
behind the contents of
their grooves—generally
decomposing animal and
vegetable matter, heavily
laden with both chemical
and bacterial poisons.
These set up suppuration,
and in a short time the
wound becomes a large
ulcerated sore, which may
take a couple of years to
heal completely. Even when
the wound is promptly
cleaned out and treated
with antiseptic substances
one can’t be sure that it
is perfectly sterile and
aseptic. I have seen a
bite in which the start of
the suppuration was de-
layed until nearly a week
afterwards, the patient
having had hospital treat-
ment in the interval.
“Animbra”: Re “Merlin’s” inquiry about
Binghi’s mongrel, (B. 13/10/’2l). The Territory
coon’s hounds are bred from dingoes caught when
pups and crossed with station dogs. But give a
nigger a well-bred dog, and after a month of camp
life it can hardly be distinguished from the mongrels.

“R.F.G.”: A friend of mine has two small
snakes, one about Ift. 6in. and the other 2ft. They
are greyish-brown and right on top of the head is a
jet black patch with a small greyish ring separat-
ing it from another black patch. Will some Abo.
name them and say if they are poisonous?
“Bordei-”: “Jobber’s” inside-waybacks (B.
23/3/’22) remind me of two unmarried sisters of 76
and 78 who live at Bordertown (S.A.). They have
been in the district about 40 years, and although
only two miles from the railway station the younger
has never been ima train. The elder once travelled
to Serviceton and back —13 miles.
“Mac”: I was cultivating some rich sandy
soil alongside' a fresh-water creek, and noticed a
platypus on the bank about 3ft. above water. A
hole had been burrowed in the sand, and I didn’t
disturb the little creature, which became so used to
my presence that it would return repeatedly from the
water to the bank. The wife and I took special
care that it should not be frightened, and one
evening we noticed it in a very excited state at the
entrance of the burrow, from which presently there
crawled out two young platypi. 1 could hardly
restrain the wife from taking the fluffy little fellows
up in her hands.
* * * *
“Iota”: I saw a mob of little black ants
mustering. A heap of refuse was seething with blow-
fly-maggots up to gin. in length; and, having dis-
covered that the heap was dry and not likely to
nfuddy their boots, the ants started in. Two of
them attended to each grub, and, one at each end,
they put the nips in. The grub promptly bucked
and continued to buck with two riders stimulating
and steering him across the landscape to the nest.
Arrived at the door, the grub was finished off,
passed by the health inspector and dumped into the
cool chamber. Then the stockmen returned for
another deanskin. I saw fully 100 larvae handled
in this manner, and, considering that this is timber
and not stock country, I surmise that the ants
taught themselves the trade.
* * * *
“E.A.C.” : “Dai R.’s” call (B. 2/3/’22) fox-
starters for the Never-failing Creek Stakes lets me
introduce a little Central Bananaland
brook that has been babbling unceas-
ingly for a hearing for 50 years, and
all the droughts in the interim have
failed to quieten it. It is not much
more than a mile long and a mere
trickle at that, but because of its
permanency Springsure Creek was so
named (the township of Springsure
followed years later) by the teamsters
of the pioneering days, who made it
a general camping-ground en route
between the coast and the interior.
It is a freakish streamlet, for, to
outward appearances, it has neither
beginning nor end. The surrounding
hill 3 abound with springs, but they
don’t feed it; there is no sign of a
spring at its head, and after trickling
along for a mile or so,, it, like so
many watercourses of the Queensland
interior, takes a subterranean passage
for the rest of its journey. As for
quality, it’s much too good to mix with bad whisky.

“Morob”: A fruitful source of argument
in New Guinea and the Solomons is the question
whether every animal killed with a poisoned arrow
may be eaten with safety. Some hold that only
vegetable arrow-poisons are dangerous in these cir-
cumstances, and that game brought down with
weapons doctored with animal poisons may be safely-
eaten, provided it is well cooked. The probabilities
are that these are right. Animal-venom arrows are
infected with organisms which are, as a rule, killed
during the cooking process and which in most cases
would be harmless if taken into the alimentary tract,
it being necessary for them to gain entrance to the
blood by means of a wound or a break of some kind
in the skin before they are able to do any harm.
On the other hand, venoms of vegetable origin may
be either unaltered by the heat of cooking or else
broken up into still more dangerous substances. Inci-
dentally, natives in some parts avoid eating game
that has been killed with poisoned spears or arrow's,
but those in other places seem to have no prejudice
against it.

“H.V.E.”: Re a brown snake hatching out
hybrid tiger and brown snakelets from her eggs (B.
16/3/’22). The tiger is not an egg-layer, but pro-
duces its young alive, like the black devil. How-
ever, on one occasion I marked a brown snake and
a lady black canoodling, so hybrids may sometimes
result. And a dweller in snake-haunted country avers
that he has found under the same sheet of bark
snakelets partaking of the coloration of blacks,
browns and tigers.
“Hayband”: "Bootes” (B. 9/3/’22) asks
how to cure a sheep-dog of kangaroo-chasing. A
mate of mine whose dog took after rabbits gave it
about 70yds. start, then sent a charge of shot after
it. The pellets merely stung, digging up the hair.
Two applications did the trick.

“Uramao” : A Maori method of resuscitat-
ing an apparently-drowned person is to suspend the
patient from a tree by the feet, light a fire under him
and then massage the body vigorously. Hori be-
lieves that the smoke draws the water from the
body, but, anyhow, the thing acts. One Maori autho-
rity who cannot be doubted instances the case of a
girl who had been two hours in the water and
whose body was stiff and swollen. She is now a
healthy woman and the mother of three children.

“Allyn”: In the Mount Hutton district,
near Roma (Q.), there are huge mud springs which
are death-traps to travelling stock. The mounds,
which are covered with a thin crust of earth and
rank vegetation, look inviting to hungry cattle, but
animals disappear • as soon as they land on them.
The dust on the edges of these mounds is used by
swagmen as a substitute for baking-powder in making
damper.
“Kahbionba”: I have been young and now
am old, but I have seen this occurrence only once. In
the middle of a bright hot summer day I noticed,
a party of about six bats hawking among and above
the timber, and sometimes settling for a spell as
swallows do. I have often seen bats hawking before
sunset; but that has always been upon a dull
cloudy evening. Generally speaking they have an
extreme objection to bright daylight. These bats
seemed lighter in color than the little bats that
blunder into lit rooms at night, and about twice as
big; but they were flying so high and fast that I
could not observe them Closely.
“Fraoch” : Calling at a Riverina (N.S.W.)
sheep-station in quest of a job, I asked for the boss.
He came out of the house towards me, winding a
gold watch. Muttering something he threw the time-
piece on the ground in front of me and turned back
into the house, whence he reappeared with a gun.
After discharging both barrels at the watch, he turned
and said, “Now, what do you want ?” He never
found out. I learned subsequently that his beverage
was white rum.
“Jackeroo” : These buslimen are the dizzy
limit. Hang on a second and listen to this. While
Alex. Weir’s car was bogged near Duranbandi (Q.)
it caught alight and was practically destroyed. The
insurance folk sparred up, and Alex, bought the
wreck for a mere song. Then with a mate he went
out in a sulky to see what could be done with it.
After the neddy had pulled the remains out of the
bog Weir took the front wheels off and somehow

fitted them on to the back axle, rigged a benzine
tin as a petrol tank and used some lamp tubing as
a pipe. He took the wheels off the sulky and fitted
them on ~to the front axle, put the body of the sulky
on the burnt frame, and, driving with a pair of pliers
fastened on to the steering rod, hit out in style for
the township. He was followed by his cobber on a
nag that was absolutely dumfounded.
ROGAN’S PLANTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tim Rogan bought a new machine
To plant his spuds in rows,
With plenty room left in between
For him to work his hoes.
‘She was the best, she bate the rest,”
Said Rogan, “at the shows.”
He drove old Bluey straight along,
But soon he had to stop;
His planting work was going wrong—
No taters seemed to drop.
Said Tim: “Bedad, she’s shapin’ bad ;
I’m thinkin’ she’s no chop.”
Then off his perch Tim Rogan got
And oiled the driving chain;
He screwed the nuts, and cursed' the lot,
And started on again ;
But still it failed, and Rogan wailed:
“ ’Twould droive a mahn insane.”
The expert came, and Rogan swore:
“The flamin’ thing’s a dud !
She’s stuck me up this hour an’ more—
She will not plant a shpud.
She’s gone on stroike an’ sarved me loike
A rooral worker w’u’d.”
The expert looked inside the box —
He’d turned the lid around—
And said he knew: he’d bet his socks
The spuds were in the ground.
“The planter’s true; but it’s for you
To see that.seed is found.
“For perfect work it’s guaranteed ;
But we don’t covenant,”
The expert said, “to plant your seed
When there is none to plant.”
Said Rogan: “Sure, they’re on the flure
Av me ould shed beyant.”

The Low Cost of Electricity
FEW people realize how little it costs to own and
operate Delco-Light, One penny will buy enough
kerosene and lubricating oil to generate 200 watts of
electricity. This is enough to pump 235 .gallons of
water on a 22-foot lift; run a washing machine con-
tinually for one hour; light one 20-watt lamp for 10
hours; light five 20-watt lamps for 2 hours; run a sewing
machine for 2 hours.
This low cost of electricity, is due to the operating
efficiency of Delco-Light. All models have the famous
valve-in-head, four-cycle engine, with air cooled cylinder.
They are self-cranking and have only one place to oil.
The Storage Battery is of special Delco-Light type,
having thick plates, with both wood and rubber separ-
ators, insuring long years of satisfactory service.
The sterling dependability of Delco-Light, its low
cost of operation and high generating efficiency are being
proven over and over every day in the homes and on the
farms of more than 140,000 enthusiastic users in every
part of the world. There’s a Satisfied User near you.
We urge you to ask him what he thinks of Delco-Light.

thought, not in its early outward achieve-
ment. For lack of a written tongue during
those five thousand years of mental develop-
ment that thought is practically lost to us;
what remains is the instinct of the race —
the essence of the thought as it is preserved
m our blood and nerve tissue.
In our alleged progress we have borrowed
enormously from east and west. We have
built as the Pharaohs built, organised as
the Assyrians organised; we have gone to
Asia for our religions, to Asia-infected Greece
for our philosophies. All this is surely a
mistake. The essence of the matter is
within us, not without. If our thinkers
would get down to a solid basis, they must
understand that the things suitable for other
races are of little permanent use to us. You
cannot let mental advance by contract, nor
allow other peoples to build up a race in-
stinct for you. Let us find out what people
of European blood dream of, hope for, find
satisfaction in, and then shape our progress
accordingly ; it will go permanently and trium-
phantly in no other direction. If that direc-
tion is the re-establishment of political aris-
tocracies, let it be so; but shape the aristo-
cracy to meet modern needs. If the direc-
tion is anarchy, let it be anarchy; but shape
that also to our needs. The whole mischief
is in the clash of good-looking theory with
deeply-rooted instinct. It is quite conceiv-
able that with the restoration of song, long
life and passionate living, all the modern
theories of political control might become
merely as the tremendous clash of Tweedle-
dum and Tweedledee. “I can’t see why we
want it,” has been the heart-cry of Europe
for a hundred generations. And as a plain
matter of fact we don’t want most things.
DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
J. F. Archibald
I have been waiting with growing impa-
tience tor the quanued biographer wno,
striking the right note, would give some-
thing like a just valuation of a great per-
sonality gone to his rest.
As a good Democrat, tlie butter of the
elegist was noxious to j. F. Archibald, and
the personal paragraph, chased editorially,
avoided m his own case. But his place as a
factor in the evolution of Australian character
is another matter —his journalistic and social
aims, and their inhuence on his contempo-
raries and our future. The rule for measure-
ment here suggested is that of ideals and
ideas and the degree in which the indi-
vidual succeeded in realising them. And
the national value oi tne ideas and
ideals in themselves. From the stand-
point of social service, true greatness
may differ widely from contemporary
estimates; not only his own but many follow-
ing generations may pass before an originating
mind is fairly placed. For instance, how
tew know that, fbr the mental virility lead-
ing the now United States to their liberty
and < l° ris t l thtion, that country is chiefly in-
debted to the Pennsylvanian editor Thomas
aine that the clearness of vision in this
one man gave backbone and constancy to
otherwise lukewarm revolutionists? The
social loss to those freed States when, owing
to prejudice, Paine was dethroned as a
national hero and a mere soldier put in
his place, cannot be estimated; but this is
5 e U untruth has always to be paid for.
iif h i ltam ? m ’ blacklisting Faine for his lack
theology, has evolved in the passing years
a sickly sentimentality in public speech, and
a J ast and horrible corruption in much pri-
vate conduct. It may seem a far journev
ci”j“ th f Arbuckle case to the ostra-
cising of Tom Paine for proclaiming what
t° the truth; yet the biolo-
gist tiaces it as a clearly-blazed track.
min? 0 > g ™ our . brief history for the new
nVu-nM cha Ptering its advance, there is one
aatable cl 'eation peculiar to Australia—a
c,3^ P ?- r without clippings, welcoming the
contributions ot any writer from any point
n ™ w ’ and paying for them, with the one
P oviso that they must be interesting. It
“ * worlds record, yet differing from so
_ „?-X °ther records in having an immense
social value. I here have been many clever
writers who have edited notable journals;
ba £ « tbe editor who has subordi-
nated himself to an ideal, followed it for a
lifetime, slaving at it, never satisfied • only
sometimes not quite so dissatisfied? An edi-
tor with the bower-bird eye for bright things,
nding them where no one else would look
tor them, and then arranging and rearrang-
jected? m Some P attern only his mind pro-
Regarding ideas as the real things that
™ at y^ p ’ ? onsid er wlmt such a journal meant
to budding original minds. They had the
chance to express themselves: not, as is
usuafly the _ case, ideas shackled with the
editorial point of view or limitations, or
the proprietor s obligations to his adver-
tisers or political friends. For the first time
the unknown scribe was given something like
the real freedom of the press ; for what was the
wW° f „ P?a f m ed P m , t 0 write and publish
what you would if there were no means of
doing it? And this outlet for self-expression
never so opened to any peonle before led
to a mngmficent response, and that more in
total than individual result. What reached
publishing standard represented only a frac-
tion of the MS. not ouite so good, so great
was the stimulus to orioinal thought And
the mmd to conceive and carry out this pro-
ject was J. F. Archibald’s. p
The Quest for the distinctive in Austra-
lian prose and verse led to some strange con-
nections. Such an erratic crew of contri-
butors never before cursed or blessed an
editorial ; for it is a peculiarity of ima°--
mat’.ve n -bilitv to show a freouent uncon-
ventional slackness in other directions a
biography of such ability would be for the
most part a history of moral crinnl OCJ. In
result, rf the aroused local writers did not
reach the standards of Poe, Swinburne and
Maupassant with the pen, they did with
the pot. There were habitual bilks 'and bum-
mers, and cases hard enough to turn the
edge of an axe. Only an Archibald would
have attempted to harvest figs off such seem-
ing thistles, to pay the price in patience
and toleration; for he had the vision to
see that for editorial purposes the only
morals to be considered in a contributor were
the honesty of workmanship and originality
of his script.. In its social and national
results the stimulus of such editing is be-
yond calculation; for the wave of impulse
continues. In comparison with such an edi-
tor the preacher, politician and conventional
journalist are of no account; for, phono-
graphs of formulas, they represent not them-
selves but the party thought they express.
A striven-for ideal may have unexpected
result: the local effort to express on the
printed page the infant soul of a peonle
repaired the accompaniment of the picture
—for a child first perceives with the eyes.
Thus a market was created for the local
artist in black and white. And, without
doubt, the art in form of most service to a
nation is its self-expression in design,
acclaimed and paid for; the statues of
Greece, pictures of Italy, architecture of
England and dress of France being at best
only misfits when transported.
These comments have reference to the
paper so far only as its first editor was re-
sponsible ; it would be hopeless to ask it
to print anything beyond that—anything
apart from the purely personal, of its later
history, which must be judged by that inex-
orable critic, the Future. But we. who are
the future of a past, have the duty laid on
us to personally appraise the national work
of J. F. Archibald, if for no higher reason
than the revealing of the faith within our-
selves.
H. FLETCHER.
Heroines
How the ideal girl changes! She who
pleased our fathers is no longer acceptable
to us, and the novelists seem to have this
in mind when composing “best-sellers”;
they realise that they must at least pro-
vide their readers with attractive heroines.
One of the reasons given for the failure of
the classic novels to appeal to the general
public is that the heroines are insipid;
they would be quite unsuitable as “studies”
for present-day magazine covers. This
rejection by the crowd of many of the Old
Masters is not confined to literature. Itubens,
who has been called the greatest of the pic-
torial artists, is now merely an excuse for
scoffing, and this is mainly due to the fact
that the women he depicted are unlike the
recognised types of to-day. Reynolds stated
that Rubens was the greatest master of the
mechanical part of his art that ever existed;
Norman Lindsay, the greatest Australian
artist to date, has declared: “This giant in
his sense of inexhaustible vitality has the
effect of a torrent that drowns all feebler
efforts”; and, again: “Rubens is the master
of all that is strong and gay, of the courage
that has done with timidity and convention.”
But the present age will have nothing to
do with those artists who express them-
selves ; rather must they speak for the mob,
and for this reason it has decided that, be-
cause Rubens has exhibited a want of grace
in his female figures, he must not be praised.
It would seem that an artist’s hold on pos-
terity is largely determined by his ability
or inability to do justice to the eternal
mental and physical' attributes of woman.
Truly a difficult task; but, says the crowd,
by this shall ye know him.
How many of the heroines of the past do
satisfy the tastes of the reading public to-
day? Some time ago Professor Saintsbury
had the courage to name five 19th-century
women whom he would have been glad to
marry: Elizabeth Bennet, of “Pride and
Prejudice”; Diana Vernon, of “Rob Roy”:
Beatrix Esmond; Argemone Lavington, of
“Yeast”; and Barbara Grant, of "Day d
Balfour.” Saintsbury exhibited a truly
catholic taste, and certainly showed consid-
erable appreciation of diverse temperaments
and a magnificent bravery. What a noisy
harem he would keep! I wonder how many
men would really care to have Beatrix as
a life-partner? She is very fascinating in
the novel; but what would she be like in
our own house?
The English novel in order to satisfy
public taste is generally a tale of courtship
in which the strongest and cleverest man
wins the most beautiful and most gifted
woman. The craving for novelty in charac-
terisation has produced great changes in
heroines, but to this must be added
the desire of the male for the up-to-date,
pleasure-loving type of woman. No man
now courts the gild of “soft melancholy”
who indulges in “lonely walks at morning
before anyone is up.” Yet Julia Mannering
was quite as popular a heroine as the more
robust Diana Vernon of the same age. Read-
ers still admire the latter, but Julia is now
an “impossible” woman. Nor would the
young man of to-day be anxious to possess,
like the Vicar of Wakefield, the wife who
“was a good-natured, notable woman; and
as for breeding there were few country
ladies who could show more. She could
read any English book without much spell-
ing; but for pickling, preserving and cook-
ing none could excel her.” Perhaps deep
down in his heart man admits that this
simple type would, in the end, satisfy him
more than that in vogue at present as de-
picted in Ethel Dell’s masterpiece, “The
Way, of an Eagle.” Mur'el Roscoe “came
haltingly back to the surface of things”
(whatever they were!). “She flashed him
a desperate glance in which anger, fear,
abhorrence were strongly mingled. He ad-
vanced the biscuit a little nearer. There
was a queer look on his yellow face, almost
a bullying 100k....and against her will,
almost without conscious movement, she
obeyed him. The untempting morsel passed
from his hand to hers, and und 3 r the com-
pulsion of h ; s insistence she b@gan to ent.”
etc., etc. “Oh, splendid heroine!” to quote
Hugh McCrae.
George Meredith in 1905 wrote to a
friend: “Sinc° I began to reflect I have
been impressed by the injustice done to
women, the constraint nut upon their natu-
ral aptitudes and faculties, generally much
to the degradation of the race. I have not
studied them more closely than I have men,
but with more affection, a deeper interest
in their enfranchisement and development,
being assured that women of the indepen-
dent mind are needed for any sensible degree
of progress. They will so educate their
daughters that these will not be instructed
at the start to feel themselves naturally in-
ferior to men, because less muscular, and
need not have recourse to practise arts,
feline chiefly, to make their way in the
world.” Would that Meredith had lived a
little longer! Inferior to men! The pre-
sent-day heroines: as far excel men as the
light of the sun does the moon. They are
no longer a combination of propriety and
incapacity. They attempt all that man at-
tempts. and their divine bodies have not
changed; that is the wonder of it all. They
have conquered Nature! No novelist in
these days, describing a magnificent heroine
playing a man’s part in life, would dare
even to hint, as did Charles Reade on one
occasion, that her leg acquired a “noble
swell.” She performs all manner of strenu-
ous feats and still retains her delicate charm,
her attractive force. And to the average
reading public it is all so sane, so real. They
do not nause for a moment to ask them-
selves: Can this be? How is it all going
to end? If these present heroines go on
evolving in such a startling manner, with-
out, during the nrocess. losing their divine
forms, it is hard to realise what wondrous
deeds will vet be accomplished by the frail
nrd adorable body of woman. Surely
before long the novelist will discover that,
though the spirit is wilb'ng enough, the body
is lamentably weak. Then as a matter of
necessity the present ideal girl will be for-
gotten and classed as graceless in form,
while the new heroine goes her way, glory-
ing in the adoration of the world.

The Inky Way
“Bill Bile”: Would “Pollio,” who prides himself

his idea of a “great” huiporist ? > And if “Sunshine
Sketches of a Little Town” is not “great” humor,

“J.F.H.” (Eond.) : Kennedy Jones, who was associ-
ated with Northcliffe in founding the Daily Mail,
left a tidy £206,537 to his widow. He had casu-
ally written his will in pencil on a sheet of scribbling
paper, without troubling to nominate any executors.
There were other legal omissions, but the Judge re-
garded them with a tolerant eye. Although close
friends at first, strained relations developed between
Jones and Northcliffe, and Jones wrote a book that
didn’t flatter his old partner. It was strongly sug-
gested that Northcliffe was little more than a lucky
developer of other people’s brainy ideas, and that
the man who played the principal part in launching
and popularising the Daily Mail was named Jones,
not Harmsworth. They both started as ' free-lance
journalists in Fleet-street.
“Wai”: Te llokioi, the Waikato Maori rebel news-
paper (B. 23/3/’22), was named after a Maori
mythical bird, whose scream was supposed to pre-
sage war. It was a true prophet. Although
Patara Te Tuhi (cousin of Matiitaera, the native
king), was said to be the editor, there is reason to
believe its articles, father clever, were inspired by
a FreHch priest who had a long reign of authority
in the Waikato district. Te Hokioi was such a live
paper that Sir John (then Commissioner) Gorst
prevailed upon Governor Grey to allow him to start
Te Pihoiiioi (“The Lonely Sparrow”) as a counter-
blast. The two waged a keen newspaper War rritil
Rewi Ngati Maniapoto summarily wiped out Thb
Lonely Sparrow, on March 24, 1863, by comman-
deering press and plant with a war-party.

THE POET'S MYTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m but an ancient bard of rhyme amid the Great
World’s spin
Who’s watched the four-wheel cab go out, the motor-
’bus come in ;
I’ve seen the “masher” change to “knut,” “stage-
toff” to “picture-fan,”
But still unchanged amid them stalks my hate, the
Business Man.
I see him as a nightmare and a spectre-at-the-fcast;
He may perchance be human, but to me he’s just a
Beast
With sharpened claw and hungry tooth that lurks
since Time began
’Mid ad.-besprinkled jungles for his prey:—the Busi-
ness Man.
His shiny top-hat’s mostly gone, his black suits
change to drabs,
He hasn’t neat side-whiskers, and he doesn’t ride in
cabs;
His waistcoat white and huge gold chain have van-
ished from the plan ;
But still he’s ev’ry poet’s hate —the fierce, bad Busi-
ness Man.
When day is done and shadows fall, the Wild Beast
seeks his lair;
I picture him replete with meat, low-brooding in his
chair;
His bloodshot eyes stare greedily, his slow, dull brain-
works plan
Some plot to bring the poet low —that envious Busi-
ness Man.
And much as friends may reason and assure me he’s
a myth,
A bard must have some Satan of his own to battle
with;
Why tell me he’s a decent chap, no tiger drugged
with beef?
The Wicked Business Man’s to me a matter of
Belief t
So when at noon each day beside my counter-lunch
I stand,
With burning zeal inside me and a sandwich in my
hand,
The well-dressed city-clerks around uplift their eyes
and stare
As I gaze skyward piously and chant my well-worn
prayer.
When Last Trumps sound in glory and there ain’t
no west nor east
I’d like a quiet corner, safe from him —the Business
Beast,
A-prowling through the goldways, a-buying up. the
harps,
A-changing of the Blessed to a drove of saintly sharps,
A-plastering the Mansion wall with ads. of useless

PATENT STEEL SPLIT
THE BARRY STEER SPLIT rULLEY
represents the most considerable for-
ward step yet taken in tile design and
manufacture of a steel split pulley.
The BARRY is El Ideally Spot Welded by
the latest and most improved methods. Weld-
ing is the strongest possible means of joining
metals, presenting many advantages over the
old-style riveting. There are no rivets in a
BARRY Pulley to work loose or shear under
strain. The BARRY is made of special steel
and formed in accurately constructed dies.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Te Pana”: Christchurch (M.L.) City
Council once tried running a tramway
hearse. But after the first trip the public
rose against freighting corpses to the cemetery
with trams fore and ait. The white ele-
phant was fed for a long period of unuseful-
ness, and then the Council turned it into a
toolshed. After that it saw service as a
campers’ hut, and it ended its career as a
chicken roost.
* * * *
“Wondah” : A wheelwright over 50 years
ago made four stripper wheels from well-
seasoned, locally-grown she-oak for W. His-
coclc, of Meningie, Lake Albert (S.A.). His
sons, Hiscoek Bros., of the same address,
are still using them, and they are as good
as the day they were made.
« « * *
“Nadelian”: Some specifications posted to
an Adelaide contractor failed to turn up. A
week or so later he got a notification from
the P. 0., delivered by the letter carrier, to
the effect that the packet was lying at the
office, as he could not be found at tlie address
on the envelope. The address on this noti-
fication had been copied from the-address on
the packet; at any rate, they were identical.
*** . *
“The Rumpus” : I was once a partner in
a small butchery business in the grape coun-
try, where one beast was sufficient meat for
two days. I used to ride around the various
vineyards booking the orders, but one after-
noon when I was suffering a recovery from
the wine-vats of the previous day my partner
took up the running. Evidently he too
did a fair bit of sampling, for.when I went
to make up the orders next morning I found
he had booked 29 ox-tails for Saturday!
• •
“T. 0.1.”: On March 31, 1831, a little
paddle-wheel steamer, the first of the kind
built in Australia, was launched for service
between Sydney and Parramatta. She was
built by Henry Gilbert, and took four hours
to do the trial trip. Her owners, or lessees,
were the Australian Steam Conveyance Co.,
which was not a successful venture —it
failed, and the treasurer, John Thomas Wil-
son, fled leaving £30,000 ?ff debts behind.
He wound up as a sly-grog seller somewhere
in the Straits Settlements.
* * * *
“The Moralist” : The industry of the kerb-
stone tinker has been invaded in Brisbane
by a couple of hefty young tinsmiths who
flit round the suburbs in a smart travelling
workshop mounted upon a Ford. Judging by
their slick style of renovating damaged
kitchen-ware, the familiar little, grimy-faced
old potterer with his bundle of dilapidated
brollies and his smoking firepot is due for a
pass-out check.
* * # *
“Wagtail”: One of a gang laying an elec-
tric cable along Mount Alexander-road,
Moonee Ponds (Vic.), the other day forgot
his lunch, but wasn’t in the least perturbed
about it. Towards midday he strolled to
the nearest house. “Missus,” he said to the
lady who answered his knock, “that dog of
yours stole my lunch from my coat-pocket,
and I reckon it’s up to you to replace it.”
And full of apologetic sympathy, she put him
up a crib that made our mouths water.
* * * *
“Tren”: When warned against buying a
house numbered 13, I laughed. But the run
of bad luck that followed the clinching of
the deal took all the humor out of it. So
consistently did things go against me that I
was contemplating a change of address, when
I saw the announcement that a French
policeman had the other day won a lotterv
worth a million francs with ticket No. 131313
Now I mean to stay where I am and concen-
trate on Tatt.’s.
* » # *
“Adelaide”: The Army and Navy Stores
Co., of S. Aus., has taken a long time; to get
going. Its capital of £94,000 was almost all
in gratuity bonds, and there was great diffi-
culty in turning them into cash on terms at
all reasonable. It made a start among sol-
dier settlements on the Murray, but has now
opened up in Adelaide, where Acting-Premier
Bice did the necessary oratory over it. The
building selected is one of four floors, the old
G. and R. Wills boot-factory, in Pirie-street.
• * * »
“F.C.”: Last year I was taking some
export fruit into the State Cool Stores at
West Melbourne when I noticed boxes of
butter being loaded on to a lorry that bore
(he name of a well-known firm of soap- and
candle-makers. The grease was running on
to the lorry and oiling the axles; and it
fairly screamed This butter was “pool”
stuff, kept too long. I don’t know how much
went that way, but the lorry I saw bore 80
boxes. And meanwhile the public had been
paying 2s. Bd. a lb.
* ■* « *
“T.H.R.” : How’s this for gratitude? The
other night I met a fairly well-dressed man
who told me he had nowhere to sleep. There
was an empty bed in my room, so I took
him there and gave him half my supper.
Early next morning I found he had cleared
with my only decent belongings—a Glad-
stone bag, a respectable suit of clothes and
one or two shirts. I was reserving those
things in case I happened to get a job where
a decent r'g ut was necessary. I could
easily identify the man. but if I put the mat-
ter in the hards of the police the punish-
ment would probably b° out of all proportion
to the crime. Tie should have a bad nuarter
of an hour with his conscience some day.
“’OT PIES! OT PIES!"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like curtains hang the dark cathedral walls.
He flutters in the glow beside the kerb.
His clothes are broken and his name is ’Erb.
Upon his bristling face the firelight falls ;
His cry is: “Baked pertaters ! Saverloys!”
The petrol stinks. His fingers are not clean.
Soot-marked and flavored well with kerosene,
His wares delight two smutty Herald boys.
“Pertaters! Saverloys! ’Ot pies! ’Ot pies!”
A thin crowd drifts, the faces set in frames
Of night. Shrill sound the vendor’s pleading cries:
“’Ot pies!” His curse is eloquent and odd.
He pours more petrol, and the sudden flames
Set red imps bounding on the house of God.

“Driab” : At a picnic recently at Cockatoo
Creek (Vic.), among those invited were Mes-
dames Parratt, Swallow and Partridge, ar.d
Misses Peacock, Fowler and Sparrow.
In the final rush before the N.S.W. elec-
tion 139,062 names, including ghosts, were
put on the roll. Of these 77,556 were in the
eight metropolitan constituencies, and that
unconsidered trifle, the Rest of the State, had
61,506. Poor old Rest of the State !
“Subscriber”: Nero merely treated Rome
to a solo while it was burning, but Port
Pirie (S.A.) has fared better. The Adel-
aide Express (21/3/’22) concludes a report
of a big fire there with the remark: “Quartets
were rendered by Messrs. Ross, Hall, Bartles
and Wright.”
Breezy Bill Adamson, who was Works
Minister under Peacock from 1915 till 1917
and Honorary Minister under Watt, wili
quit the Uppah Chambah in June. His
present term will be up then, and, although
it would be easy for him to hold on, he will
take the advice of his doctor and retire from
all public activities. He is just getting over
an illness in which he had a hard fight.
“Pog”: “Jobber’s” inside waybacks (B.
23/3/’22) reminds me of a man of 45 who
up till last year had not seen a train, although
he was living only 15 miles from a railway
town (CurJewis, N.S.W.). Also, he has
never seen a motor-car. His humpy is a few
miles off the main road. When last I was
talking to him 1 happened to mention tele-
phones, and had to explain how “the darned
things” worked.
Very few seem to have noticed that an old
friend who fought in the front ranks of
Labor at last Ma State election was absent
this time. People then were urged to put
the O’Whirrs within reach of the Treasury,
in order, among other things, that Ireland
might be free, and her green and glorious
feet set on the paths of peace. This time
the partly liberated and partly disem-
bowelled place was so little mentioned that
it might never have existed.
“Six and Eight”: Judges and magistrates
are largely responsible for the frequent
blackguardism in "testing for credit” (B.
23/2/22). Every Court has power to dis-
allow such questions when it thinks the
answers would not affect the veracity of
the witness as to the matter deposed to, and
why Courts don’t exercise this power is
beyond me. Incidentally, though Justices
daily permit blackguardly attacks on the
characters of witnesses by low-class advo-
cates, the law carefully provides that
prisoners shall not be subject to such
annoyance. By legislative enactment no
person charged with an indictable offence
may be questioned as to character or ante-
cedents without leave of the Judge. I can’t
see why the same rule should not be applied
to witnesses.
“Fax”: Victoria’s National War Memorial
is to be erected on what is still referred to
as “the Grange property,” though nearly 20
years have elapsed since Premier Watt paid
£30,000 ot Government money for the ground
and certain buildings on it in order to re-
store it to the Domain, from which it had
originally been filched. None of the land
has even yet been openly surrendered to
its real owners; and whether the proposed
memorial will absorb some unexplained pri-
vate domiciles, etc., which still occupy the
area, is not stated. Anyhow, the site, at
the corner of Domain and St. Ivilda
roads, is quite the right position for the
purpose, and commonsense may be expected
to protest against any intrigue to prevept
an end being put to the present mysterious
misuse of the area.
“Tren”: The London Lyceum, home of the
Girl that Took the Wrong Turning, the
Worst Woman in London, and so many more
that are great and glorious in our national
drama, was on the point of being closed
owing to a bitter quarrel that reached
the Courts between brothers Frederick and
Walter Melville, wno have managed the
house for 25 years. The catastrophe was
averted by a melodramatic reconciliation.
The brothers announced that they would
with the theatre at the end of the
“Cinderella” panto season; but on the last
night friends who were acting as peace-
makers redo'dved their efforts to bring about
a reunion, and the bold Baron, after telling
the. audience what had been happening be-
hind the scenes, prematurely announced that
Deace was signed. The cheering that
followed proved too much for the brothers,
and, with due regard for theatrical effect,
they walked on to the stage from opposite
wings, shook hands, and after wiping their
tears away, announced that they intended
to cnrrv on.
“Malua” (Samoa) : During the war
papain, the dried juice of the pawpaw, was
worth 20s. per lb., and even at the present
16s. its production pays handsomely. A
coolie can make lib. weight daily without
exerting himself, so that a white man work-
ing his own place would do perhaps 31b.
The juice is procured by making an incision
in the green paw-paw with a bone or wooden
knife, causing the fluid to flow into an
earthenware cup. The flow ceases after a
time, and some juice coagulates round the
cut. This is removed with a knife and
put in with the rest. The fruit is left on
the tree and may be tapped several times —
every two or three days. The juice coagu-
lates rapidly and should be dried as soon as
possible, otherwise it decomposes. Juice
collected in the early morning should be
wholly or partly dried before mid-day. Sun-
drying is a success, but a hot-air drier is
better. The process should continue until
the product is crisp enough to be reduced to
a powder, in which form it is sold. France
and Canada are the best and surest markets.

accompanied by a friend to whom she was
much attached. On reaching the summit
the friend collapsed and in a few minutes
expired. • The lady decided that he should
be buried on the spot. The headstone still
stands, erected “to the memory of my collie
Rex, who died of snakebite.”
“Oilskin”: “T.W.” (P». 23/3/’22) says
the War Office has sought out most of its
5,000,000 medal-winners in-whatever part of
the world they may be. Then I’m one of
the Ishmaels it hasn’t found. The last time
I wrote to London I was told that my medals
were being forwarded. That’s long ago, but
they are still on the way. Incidentally, my
pension came to a sudden halt two months
ago, and as I hold the King’s certificate to
the effect that I’m a dud for life I’m begin-
ning to look sideways upon the assertion
that Britain never forgets.
“Te Pana” : Census returns show that the
Maori population is still increasing. The
first numbering of the Maoris took place in
1874, when the scrapping was over and the
natives were settling down. The total then
was 45,470. From that time till 1896 the
number faded to 39,854; then the occasional
higher education of Henare began to bear
fruit in attention to hygiene, etc., and the
figures to-day stand at 52,571. About 96
per cent, of them are living in the North
Island, and in three counties the natives
outnumber the pakehas. Included are nine
lone representatives of the ancient and
almost-extinct Morioris, all of them living
in Chatham Islands.
“Peterkin”: Recent discussion as to the
usefulness or otherwise of trade commis-
sioners reminds me ox a cablegram published
in the Melbourne Herald a year or two
before the Great Killing. . This was from
the Agent-General for Victoria in London,
and recommended a trial shipment of 501)
cases of apples to Hamburg, where he was
convinced they would realise good prices, and
probably lead to the opening-up of a consider-
able trade. As a matter of fact the German
Australian S.S. Co. had landed in Hamburg
during the previous season from 25,000 to
30,000 cases of Australian apples; but the
amazing ignorance displayed did not, so far
as I am aware, call forth any comment from
the trade here.
“O. Blin”: Two suburban picture-shows
used to be noted for the violence of their
rivalry. It was a poor district, and on
Fridays both of them furnished an evening’s
slaughter for od., 3d. and Id. One Friday,
Blank, who paraded his tattered tragedies in
a retired woodyard, had a bright idea, and at
the finish of his d.splay presented each
patron with a small bottle of dirty fluid
labelled “Chloroform for Your Use When
Next You Visit Blink’s Pictures.” Blink
was the other fellow, and for two or throe
days he was too incensed to think out a fit-
ting retort. Then he suddenly remembered the
variety of life at Blank’s, and the following
Friday night distributed among his sup-
porters small tins bearing the inscription:
“Try This Insectibaue When Next You Go
to Blank’s.”
“S.M.”: These Laborites are so “class-
conscious” that they depend on the “capi-
talist” even to pay for their leader’s monu-
ment. When the John Storey memorial
fund had dragged its weary length along
a little past the £2600 mark it was men-
tioned that 37 Labor members appeared on
the list for £2B 19s, 6d., an average of 15s.
Bd. apiece! There are 45 of them in the
Assembly and a batch in the Council, and
the Assemblyites average a salary of over
£ll5O per annum —Ministers and members.
They earned it last year for less than 50
days’ work, and they will earn it this year,
up to the last days of March, for no Parlia-
mentary service at all. They also reserve
the right of private practice, and no one
can say that Minahan, the great bootman,
and McGirr, the great landlord, don’t
practise assiduously.
“Carbon Dioxide”: Re “Hanno’s” refer-
ence (B. 23/2/’22) to carbon dioxide being
used in Victoria to increase the yield of crops.
This was tried in Germany on a grandiose
scale in 1917. Glass-houses covering several
acres were constructed, and waste gases from
the Luxemburg iron blast-furnaces were used.
These gases averaged 5 per cent, carbon
dioxide, and were conducted through cement
pipes laid underground through the crops.
The increase in yield ranged from 15 to 200
per cent. The Germans actually applied the
idea at other places to increase the yield of
their crops towards the end of the war. But
Victorians are up against it if they want
to go in for carbon fertilisation by gassing
on a large scale. The cost will be great,
and where can large quantities of carbon
dioxide be readily and cheaply obtained? My
own opinion is that a great improvment in
most crops would be effected if pulverised
limestone were worked into the soil. Th : s
neutralises the organic acids present in the
soil, and so sets free carbon dioxide, part of
which is assimilated by the plant.

TRDTH IS MIGHTY
AND SHALL PREVAIL
HHE universal popularity of STUDEBAKER CARS is attested
by the fact that the corporation enjoyed the biggest
business in its history in the year 1921.
Notwithstanding the fact that the total number of all
automobiles sold (except Ford) was 40 per cent, less than
1 920, the total aggregate of sales for STUDEBAKER CARS was 29 per
cent, greater than in 1 920 — and in Canada 64 per cent, greater than in
1920.
The number of STUDEBAKER CARS sold in the year 1921
in both Greater New York and in the Metropolitan District exceeded the
sales of any other make except Ford.
Studebaker is the world’s largest producer of six-cylinder cars.
The only possible explanation of the popularity of STUDEBAKER
CARS lies in their quality, durability and dependable performance in
users’ hands. Proof that the cars stand up in service with minimum
repairs is evidenced by the fact that our sales of Repair Parts in 1921 were
12 per cent, less than they were in 1919, notwithstanding that 1 1 8,000
new cars were sold and put in operation in 1 920 and 1921. Based on the
total estimated number of STUDEBAKER CARS in operation in 1921, we
sold $16.00 worth of parts per car for repairs from all causes, including
accidents.
The materials and workmanship in STUDEBAKER CARS measure
up to the highest standards known to the automobile industry. Substan-
tially better intrinsic values cannot be obtained at any price. The theory
that high prices necessarily mean fine cars is fallacious, simply because
prices are not based upon intrinsic values, but upon production costs of
individual makers, which vary widely according to their ability and manu-
facturing facilities. Obviously, high costs of production, inevitably
arising from incompetence or inadequate manufacturing facilities, mean
not only high prices but actually inferior cars.
With $70,000,000 of actual net assets, including $36,000,000 of plant
facilities, Studebaker stands unsurpassed in ability and resources to manu-
facture economically and give the greatest intrinsic value possible for a
given price.

“A Little Dutch Girl,” having its first
Australian run at Adeia.ae Royal, xs a throw-
bacK to tue oitl comic-opera days. There is
not an Liiglrsh or an American character m
the smali-Kingdom story. Julia, reigning
princess, has apparently no relatives anu,
beyond her friend lidoise and her chamber-
lain Romba, no advisers. Drince i’aul,
personally unknown to her though betrothed
from childhood, is due to-day to marry Uer,
but rather brutally stays away and sends
his equerry, the gentle, genial l’osch, whom
Eloise at once captivates aud bullies into
acting as proxy for the Drince at the wed-
ding. Julia is not unnaturally dissatisfied
with the arrangement, and, learning that
her husband is yachting in Holland, decides
to hunt liim up. Holland proves to be
within walking distance —the author must
have bad an eye on the Princess of Luxem-
burg—and that afternoon a Dutch inn
receives two new maids and a rouseabout.
Fresh costumes, scenery and dances accord-
ingly. The Prince at once falls in love with
his unknown wife, and there the play might
end. But a third act, back at the palace,
gives room for more display; also Bomba
has had to clean Posch’s boots during the
afternoon and wants to get level; moreover,
there is a topical song to be worked off—■
about a wonderful island: Australia in the
present version. Her Serene Highness,
however, wakes up at last to the fact that
there are such things as last trams. Ada-
mant at 30.49 she melts into her Prince’s
arms at 10.50.
* * * «
This simple story has snappy lyrics by
Seymour Hicks and Harry Graham; the
music is by Kalman, with strong reliance
on waltz time. The acting is in five hands
and four feet—the latter owned by Mae
Baird and Thompson. Sheila Gale, new to
Australia, is welcome. Generously built,
with a fine voice and clear enunciation, she
suggests the Florence Young of earlier
days. Roland Hogue, who comes home again,
seems adequate rather than inspiring so far.
He will have better chances than this, for
one is so used to the modern hero being
quietly humorous, too, that this “straight”
part of nothing but love-making seems thin.
George Gee is himself in a pleasant silly-ass
character, and Hugh Ste.vne contrives to get
something new out of the conventional
Chamberlain part; audiences never willingly
let these two go. Grace Lavers is Eloise,
and does some of her best work yet. Her
acting, singing, dancing and sense of humor
have all improved ; and her eyes are still in
business at the old address.

When Nellie Stewart, as Romeo, scaled
the wall of Capulet’s garden at Melbourne
Majesty’s last Thursday there was no longer
any doubt as to why a weak benefit pro-
gramme had filled the house. Applause volleyed
and thundered. One doubted whether Nellie
had ever before had as loud a recention as
this, and questioned whether it would have
been so hearty if Romeo had looked less
young and shapely. Of all the many clever
things she has done, after failure had been
predicted of her, Nellie Stewart’s picture and
performance of Romeo, the famous voung
man, was about the most surprising. Though
a little excessive in gesture, perhaps, she was
true enough to the spirit of the scene. She
never avoided the light. Her make-up was
worthy of her wonderful past, it was
Marjorie Bennett as Juliet, not Nellie as
the slim, fuzzy-headed Montague, who looked
too old for the part. Marjorie’s farcical
comedy accents were really a handicap to the
Romeo, but the little blonde lady could not
stop the veteran artist from making a trium-
phant finish.

Pianists not more interesting than Spiva-
kovsky have been much more successfully
boosted by the ingenious Taits. For some
reason or other the crowd that sometimes
rushes instrumental concerts declined to
praise and magnify the name of Spiv. Yet
his, personality is pleasing, and his skill is
much the same as that of other young Rus-
sian pianists who have mastered the game.
If iot an inspired musician, Spivakovsky is
at least an impuovimr artist of whom much
may be expected. Two extra concerts will
be given in the Athenaeum Hall on Easter
Saturday and the 18th.
At Melbourne Palace, where Wilkie com-
pleted his honorable Shajsspearean course
last Saturday, the new tenant is Ada Reeve.
Inimitable Ada is touring the world for the
last time, she says, and ±n a mus.cai mtiange
called “Spangles” she will do her Melbourne
dash, beginning on Easter Saturday. Her
own company supports the lady.
* * * *
The 13th week of “A Night Out,” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, is not to be its last. Maud
Fane, whose figure has grown very youth-
ful again under stress of work, warbles
“Avalon” with her own particular kind of
skill, and all the other pretty women and
flappers concerned in the entertainment are
thriving on their exertions. If it runs over
Easter Maud Fane and Frith will be chiefly
tt> blame.

“Johnnie Get Your Gun” answers its
unlofty purpose at Melbourne Royal. Louis
Bennison’s simple conception of the oaf who
puts a transparently bogus duke to low-
comedy confusion is shaped on popular lines,
and if there were any pretence of subtlety in
the picture Melbourne would not approve of
it, anyhow. A terribly noisy prologue con-
tinues to precede the play, and the custard
pie never misses its cue.
* * * *
At Melbourne King’s, where Nicola per-
forms the best of the stereotyped tricks in
a commonplace manner, “The Firs,. Year”
will be produced on Saturday. Phillips Tead
and Elizabeth Dunn have come from America
to help this comic tragedy of married life
to a satisfactory conclusion, and Marjorie
THE REJECTED M.L.A.’s EASTER HYMN.
How can I live without you,
How can I let you go,
You that I love so well, dear,
You that I worship so!
Bennett will be withdrawn from “Johnny
Get-Your Gun” to play a principal part.

The Sistine Choir will be nearly half-
through its Melbourne season before any
testimony to the Choir’s historic excellence

Talbot O’Farrell, at Melbourne Tivoli, is
a vaudeville identity who finds the stalls and
circles ready to laugh before he breaks the
silence. Weight counts in the case of the
carefully-dressed fat man. Some of the
wheezes that he delivers, in' a way made
familiar by imitators maybe, are pretty pom-
stuff on the subject of Eve and the Apple,
and Beer, and Ford motor-cars. Neverthe-
less, those wheezes go, and the roars of the
multitude almost persuade one that Talbot
O’Farrell is a humorist of the first water.
But he cannot possibly be a humorist, seeing
that he presently bursts into mawkish senti-
mental song.

Mabel Normand has a five-reel smile in
action as “Molly O” at Melbourne Majestic
this week. “Molly O” is short for Molly
O’Dair, and the way she escapes from a slum
into the arms of a wealthy doctor is a tri-
bute to the fascinations of the screen colleen.
The follow-on is “The House of the Tolling
Beil,” with May McAvoy and Bruce Gordon
making suitable faces in the front positions.
At Hoyt’s “The YTrtuous Model,” starring
the Pathg heroine Dolores Cassinelli, is a
moderately spicy vision of alleged life in
Parisian studios. On the same bill Conway
Tearle toils for picturesque effects in
“Shadows of the Sea,” but he hasn’t as
much attraction for cheerful people as the
lively comedians Eddie Lyons and Lee Moran
in “Fixed by George.” Hoyt’s are picturing
some bits of India where the royal feet of
Edward P. have recently trod.

“The Babes in the Wood” will arrive at
their Sydney journey’s end this week. On
Saturday Her Majesty’s curtain goes up on
“A Little Dutch Girl.” which has had a
preliminary run in Adelaide and won the
approval of The Bulletin’s local taster.

Sydney is busy agree : ng that Emebe
Polini will never get such another skin-fit
as “My Lady’s Dress,” and watching the
Criterion box-office the Taits reckon they’ll
have enough in fhe bank for a sheet to ward
off the rainy day, even should the Macin-
tosh of the trade join the elements against
them.

Allen Doone treads Sydney Palace boards
once more as “The Parish Priest.” And of
all Doone’s parts that of the gentle but firm
custodian of his flock suits him the best.
As the pretty niece Edna Keele.y shakes her
locks at admirers, and in the enchantment
of the curling strands the onlooker forgets
that the little favorite has grown dreadfully
fragile.
The Frolics are back again in Sydney at
their old address in Castlereagh-street. They
return with a more compact, and harmonious
show, and a Tivoli audience saw th°m open
up on Saturday with a sprightly preliminary
canter through “All the Winners.” There
are eight kaleidoscopic scenes, including a
dazzling manneouin parade and supper-
dance and Chinatown settings: and
“Mon Homme” appeases an alleged demand
for the complexities of the Parisian under-
world. The fooling throughout is fresh and
brisk. Marie La Yarre is an acceptable
leading lady; Ley land Hodgson perseveres
with his sentimental warbling; and
Pressy Preston, Clarice Hardw.cK, Renee
Bailee, Harrington Reynolds, Tal Ordell and
Lance Fairfax help the show to run
smoothly. Gladys Hermes and Ray McLean
are the notable dancers, Moon and f .-orris
the comedians who win the loud laughs, and
Hector St. Clair is a droll dame. On the
vaudeville side Sam Barton, Yost and Clady
and Scott Argyll are worth their places in
the big holiday bill.

Allan Wilkie will bring Shakspeare to
Sydney next Saturday evening, and give him
shelter at the Grand Opera House. Twelve
of the plays will be produced during the
month. That opening performance will be
Allan Wilkie’s 411th consecutive perform-
ance of the Bard.

Wirths opened their Sydney season at the
Hippodrome on Friday and introduced some
unusual turns. George Wirth recently
toured the world in search of talent, and
found it; so, besides the Wirth family, there
are acrobats from England, Ireland, France,
Japan and America, and a wart-hog billed
as the only one in Australia —lie came from
Africa. Evans and Ferez, the acrobats from
France, do some balancing on a rickety
pole 20ft. long supported on the feet of bne
member of the troupe, who spins a gaily-
colored medicine-ball to keep his hands from
getting dizzy. A troupe of Japs do the
ladder and ■ other breath-catching acts; and
Daisy and Ethel, of the Reigning Family,
manage the capering quadruped in the old
Wirthy way. The-clowns are funny, and
the band is just what it should be—a real
noisy circus-band. Afdale’s Zoo, performing
elephants and Wonderful Arabs from Surry
Hills and other foreign parts all help to make
Dad glad he had a lad to make him take
him.
** * *
At Sydney Lyceum and New Lyric Gilbert
Parker’s “Lane that Had No Turning” in-
troduces a tragedy to the marriage feast of
heroine Agnes Ayres that makes Lucy Lam-
mermoor’s look like a mere circumstance.
The same sheets offer relief from the Sor-
rows of Agnes by turning the baby spot-
light on Marion Davies, who, as the flapper
Cleopatterer, has the young men of her vil-
lage completely hypnotised. It takes a hand- j
some actor-chap to effect the cure that ends
in wedding-bells and family blessings. In
“Love’s Redemption,” at the Haynjarket, the
tropic beauty of Jamaica provides the back-
ground against which Norma Talmadge sal-
vages a down-and-out young remittance man
and earns a marriage certificate and a cold
reception from the old folks at home. Same
flicker depicts handsome Conway Tearle as
“The Man of Stone,” who runs a close
second to the famous “Sheik” who has not
yet folded his tent and silently stolen away
from the Globe. Basil King’s spook story,
“Earth Bound,” is drawing ouija-board de-
votees by the hundred to the Crystal Palace.
It certainly is a spine-thriller when the
shade of Jack Desborousrh, whose body has
just done a headlong slide down the stair-
case owing to a vital artery being punctured
by a friend’s revolver, refuses to ouit the
premises, but hangs about the corridors.

About a new Sydney p'eture-show:—
The opening exhibition of the New Art Salon at
Vickery’s Chambers, Sydney, includes only three
pictures which do any violence to an otherwise high
standard. The work of H. B. Harrison, R. McCann,
A. E. Newbury and Howard Ashton has a large share
in lifting the level so high, but the best is con-
tained in a half-dozen small landscapes by Melirum
which are remarkable for their realism. An illu-
sion of reality—the suggestion that the flat si rface
of a canvas is no longer flat, but made up of objects
receding one behind another, with real space
between —is a quality that is only to be found in
true art, and this quality is . present in a conspicu-
ous degree in Meldrum’s work. Unfortunately we
seldom look for or expect that quality, or, for
that matter, admit it as a virtue, but mostly satisfy
ourselves with pretty color, sweet decoration, or a
display of technique ; yet these qualities don’t make
great art. Meanwhile, since the necessities of life
and tranquillity of mind are regulated bv appreciation
of one’s work, the art of Meldrum is in serious
danger of languishing, and Basil Burdett’s idea of
hardling only the best work is in danger of modifi-
cation, for so far none of the deserved financial
encouragement lias come Meldrum’s way.
“T.W.”: Eleanora de Cisneros comes to
Australia again in a month or two ; her first
visit was with the Melba Opera Co. a decade
ago. She has been singing Clytemnestra in
Richard Strauss’s “Electra,” and her Aoice
must have developed much on the dramatic
side to enable her to cope with all the rav-
ings of that shrieking sister.
“Rep”: Since the popular success of “The
Skin Game” John Galsworthy’s name is
never long absent from London playbills.
The most industrious dramatist’s “Justice”
has just been revived at the Count, where
it will he followed by “The Silver Bov” and
“The Pigeon.”' His new play, “Loyalties,”
is at the St. Martin’s this month. A new T er
may be expected before the year is out.

Consider the successful business and public men you
know ; 99 per cent, of them are convincing talkers.
Let any two men start off in business life together with
equal opportunities, except that only one is a convinc-
ing talker. Before long he will "get there.” Success
MUST come his way. The other man, handicapped by
lack of the mastery of speech, strives and strives, but
somehow, in most cases, fails.
The convincing talker, the man who has cultivated the
power of speech, can talk to any man at any time, and
he meets anyone in exactly the right way, which means that ultimately he most likely will
literally talk himself into riches, fame and power.
YOUR present position in life depends upon speech—upon what you say and how you say it. Just how
very much it means to you, you exactly know only if you are already a convincing talker. But if
you are not you surely realise what a tremendous help fluent and correct speech would mean to
you in your every walk of life. You want the secret. It is yours free, for a perusal and careful
examination of “Mastery of Speech,” by Frederick Law, Ph.D., will reveal to you how you

“E.F.”: Allan Wilkie’s Richard 111., con-
sistent with the Shakspearean text in many
respects, is weakest in the tent scene. There
he makes little attempt to present the horror-
struck King that Garrick created, p ; cturf>d
for posterity by Hogarth. Garrick evidently
was a more prepossessing monster of mon-
archy than the ugly Dick that Wilkie plays.
Barry Sullivan was much the same sort of
brutal, scowling butcher, whereas Henry
Irving, following on the lines of Charles
Kean, put a finer edge on the Usurper’s
hypocrisy and a show of polish on his man-

CRITERION.

ners. But none of the Richards withiL the
memory of living theatre-goers can have
been as effective as Garrick. The Hogarth
picture conveys a sense of the little man’s
magnetism in the part: the actor must have
impressed the artist with the idea of a horror-
stricken Richard who had seen ghosts in his
dreams.
“Stargazer”: A show like “All the Win-
ners” being ostensibly a musical entertain-
ment, why is it that, though everything else
is carefully provided at great expense, the
necessity of securing singing voices for the
songs is so flagrantly disregarded? This is
a country where excellent female voices can
be got by the dozen in the class-room of any
considerable teacher of singing, yet going
to a show of this sort one finds the solos
sung by young persons with about as
much music in them as is given off
by a buzz-saw operating on a knotty
red-gum block. Often the singer is one of a
family of acrobats or head-balancers who
has acquired the habit of making throaty
noises without instruction, or she is attached
to the two knock-about comedians, dr is a
velation-by-marriage of the Irish impersonal
tor. There should be a law against adul-
terated singing as there is against banded
sugar.

all the time, has to give that State a miss.
“Fax”: One may in no unkind spirit lodge
a protest against a proposal to tender “some
form of public testimonial” to Mrs. Wieder-
mann, of Melbourne, in consideration of her
alleged personal triumphs on the operatic
and concert stage, and her alleged success as
a Conservatorium singing-teacher. What
are the tacts about the lady who became
Mrs. Pinschof when she married the former
Austrian Consul-General in Australia? Her
operatic career was a purely German affair,
said by old Liedertafel identities to have been
not at all brilliant. Her concert singing was
tiresome as long as I can remember it, and
her acceptance as a competent teacher of
singing was due to the persistent adver-
tisement of herself and her husband, who
frankly admitted that he aspired to be the
patron of music in this country. What names
can be given in proof of her capacity to
teach the art of singing whilst developing
the qualitv of a voice? In short, where is
the excuse for a “public testimonial”?
“0.K.” interviews a wonderful woman:—
Matured as well as lively is the personal interest
Fanny Wiseman takes in these Shakspearean re-
vivals of Allan Wilkie. Compared with Ellen Terry,
whose memory for lines has departed from her,
Fanny Wiseman remains a spry young thing, yet
her stage experiences date back further. A produc-
tion of “Richard III.” sets her thinking of how she
played the pert little Duke of York to G. V. Brooke’s
Richard in 1855, at the old Queen’s Theatre, Mel-
bourne, when the grandfather of Lorna Forbes was
a member of the co. Even then Fanny Wiseman
and sister Emily were accustomed to the stage. In
the previous year their parents, not long from Eng-
land, had been induced by Mrs. Charles Young, who
lived near them, to let the children trip on as
fairies in a Christmas panto. The infant Wiseman
sisters shaped so well that all thought of keeping
them off the stage had to be abandoned. As girls
in their teens they played many parts, and before
the historic time of William Saurin Lyster, the
operatic impresario, they had played in “Norma”
with Mrs. Carandini, the mother of Mrs. Palmer.
The first panto, the young Wiseman sisters fairied
in was, in fact, long enough ago fo* Carandini,
father of Mrs. Palmer, to skip in it as harlequin.
What a veteran is this bright actress, lately seen
as the Nurse in Wilkie’s “Romeo and Juliet” 1 Fifty-
five years ago she started a touring engagement with
the Edouins, and after travelling “the East” she
made good in London, where she renewed her child-
hood acquaintance with Julia Mathews. Back in
her birthland, Fanny Wiseman should have stayed
there. She played a round of Dickens characters
under the management of Charles Groves, and her
name at that time was associated with both girl
and boy parts—Dot, in “Cricket 'on the Hearth,”
Little Em’ly, Smike, Oliver Twist, Jo, Little Nell
and the Marchioness. Being of similar petite figure
to Mrs. Boucicault, she was chosen for the heroine
in productions of Boucicault' .Irish drama. She was
in the way to become a popular identity in Britain,
but Jimmy South, her long-late husband, was keen
on taking her back to Australia, and like a good
wife (and, later, the mother of 13 children) she
went to please him. As a young matron she
was a leading lady with William Hoskins at the old
Theatre Royal, Ballarat. She played Juliet, Lady
Macbeth, Pauline in “Lady of Lyons,” Ariel in
“The Tempest” and Francois the Page in “Riche-
lieu” (a favorite play with Hoskins) before fate put
the part of Topsy in her way. She was 30 when
the first Australian performance of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin” happened, and in many revivals of the drama
she was required to black her face and be conspicu-
ously funny. The last time was at Melbourne King’s
13 years ago, since when nobody offered a market
for her talent until Allan Wilkie restored the ever-
green little artist to the boards and the “legitimate”
where she met G. V. Brooke nearly 70 years ago.
The lines of many time-honored characters are
still familiar in Fanny Wiseman’s mouth. At the
shortest notice Bhe could give you a Mrs. Malaprop,
no doubt, or coach a Perdita in “A Winter’s Tale.”
It is no inconsiderable testimony to Wilkie’s talent
that an actress who learned much from Hoskins re-
gards the present star at Melbourne Palace as a
very gifted leader, stage-manager and tutor of a
Shakspearean company.
“Chevron”: Lionel Walsh recently played
his opera company in three States in three
nights: Kenmark (S.A.) on Wednesday;
Wentworth (N.S.W.), Thursday; Mildura
(Vic.), Friday. Besides the co.’s 30 people
there was baggage and scenery to shift; and
no rail to do it with either.
“Orb”: I went to church the other night
in a Sydney suburb, and thought I recog-
nised an old pal in the solemn verger. He
turned out to be James H. Martin, an actor
with half-a-century of Australian mumming
to his credit. Jimmy’s last engagement or
thereabouts was with Nellie Stewart’s co.. a
dozen years ago, and I well remember his
then venerable appearance as the Bishop of
Bath and Wells in “Sw°et Kitty Bellairs.”
He plays sacerdotal characters admirably,
and looks the part of the verger to the life.
H. 11. Davies, the brilliant dramatist who
died too soon—largely as a result of over-
work in hospitals during the war —is com-
memorated by a 25-shilling two-volume edi-
tion of his works. “The Mollusc,” “Cousin
Kate” and “Mrs. Gorringe’s Necklace” are
all that Australia has seen. Marie Temnest
has lately revived one or two of these; Rose
Musgrove played the girl’s part when “Cousin
Kate” was first seen here. “Mrs. Gorringe”
was chiefly remarkable for the brilliant
clashes between Mrs. Brough and Beatrice
Day.
“Orb”: When Tyrone Power and Edith
Crane played their last season at the Mel-
bourne Princess’s they had a big orchestra
which one evening downed fiddles just before
the start of Belasco’s “Charity Ball.” Power
was flabbergasted, and talked wildly of giv-

ing the audience its money back, but the
S.M., who had much bush-whacking experi-
ence, wouldn’t hear of such an outrage. “I’ve
often had to tell the audience at Bobbra
Woobra or Mutton Creek that we were going
to substitute ‘Muldoon’s Picnic’ for the
‘East Lynne’ they had paid to see, and if
the Backblocks will stand an apology so will
Melbourne.” Just then Musgrove’s musical
director, John Crook, blew in and offered to
play the piano, so we decided to carry on.
Crook tumbled over a flower-pot into the
orchestra-well, and began his overture, select-
ing “Home, Sweet Home.” It all came back
to me at the Sydney Town Hall the other
night when I heard Melba. warble the old
ditty to her own accompaniment, while the
State Orchestra looked on. For I was Tyrone
Power’s bush-whacking S.M.

BARON W. S. PEBCY: “Charming man, your
husband. He was a baker, was he not?”
DAME JACK WILLIAMS: “Well, yes. He did
all my dough in!”
“Fax”: When the London mail was leav-
ing a manager was said to be about to pro-
duce “The French Dancer,” in which the
name part would be played fcy “Miss Jane
Wjod, a charming Australian actress who
used to play Zaza and other strange charac-
ters.” Jane Wood? Where did Jane play
Zaza ?
“Norbell”: Hear what another Melbourne
girl, the late Florence Young, had to say
about Marchesi and Amy Castles (B.
6/4/’22) :
Then I decided to put myself under Marehesi’s
care. She is a wonderful teacher. I will tell you
something about her methods. In the first place,
she teaches all the Italian method... .All the
pupils sit in class; each one has a lesson lasting
half-an-hour, while the others look on and listen,
and profit thereby if they are so inclined, for criti-
cism is invited. This happens three times a week...
Yes, Amy Castles was studying at the same time.
Was there any disagreement about the treatment
of her voice? Oh, no; not at all. It happened
this way. Amy Castles wished to be a lyric soprano,
but Marchesi said she was a dramatic soprano—
the same type of voice as mine. Marchesi con-
sidered that Amy’s physique was against her for
appearing as a dramatic soprano on the stage. So
she wanted to train her for the concert platform.
Amy objected to this, as her desire was to go into
grand opera. So they parted, and she was subse-
quently a pupil of M. Buohy, who trained her voice
high.
“S.T.S.”: John Drinkwater’s new play
with Oliver Cromwell as hero makes him a
fine character, with a stern but lovable
mother. The biggest scene shows him beg-
ging Charles to give up the Stuart tricks
and save himself by running straight. A
bigger contrast could hardly be imagined to
Wills’s old “Charles the First,” in which
Henry Irving was a mournful and dignified
monarch, and was allowed to call Oliver “the
mouthing patriot with an itching palm.”
Wills is supposed to have had one eye on
Queen Victoria’s approval when, he dressed
up history in this way. Which recalls that
she once spoke of the Martyr King as “my
famous ancestor” : on which Professor Free-
man, who was a better historian than cour-
tier, set her right with “Your famous pre-
decessor, Madam.” Drinkwater’s play has.
as usual, stimulated research in the same
field ; Arthur Bourchier is having Lawrence
Cowen’s novel. “Bible and Sword,” drama-
tised, and will himself play Cromwell.

With rock and buttress barring me.

A thousand hands still bar me out.

Of calcium, with accent fine

Then hie me to the “smalls’’ again.

To cabbage hearts I make appeal,
To mutton heads and turnip tops!

OUR FURNITURE PAVILION ON THE SHOWGROUND.
From a very modest commencement 39 years ago we have grown to our
present magnitude; with Suburban and Provincial Branches and an army of travellers —
our weekly pay-sheet carries well over 1000 names —we have climbed to one of the leading
positions in the Commercial Life of the State. And the proud secret of our success has
been our motto:— “WE KEEP FAITH.”
At this Centenary Show we are making
A VERY SPECIAL DISPLAY OF FURNITURE, CARPETS and FURNISHINGS

The opposite sex has had a lot to say
about past Doncasters. Last year a three-year-old
colt won, just beating Wish Wynne, but on the four
preceding occasions the
big handicap was
taken by ladies. And
very seldom has one
of them been missing
from the first three.
There are at least two
in it this year—Etive
and Even Song. Etive
has lately been gallop-
ing in great form on
the track, and Even
Song showed conspicu-
ous form at Rosehill.
Taking one thing with
another they should
be making a race of
it on Saturday at the
finish, with that well-
liandicapped pair Dun-
wil and Braehead.
Major IT.
McCULLOCH, a
familiar figure on
the Victorian turf.
Sydney Cup is mostly fatal to favorites,
and this year it looks more open than ever. If
Salitros could be trusted (which he can’t) he would
be judged on his last outing to have a rare chance.
As it is, Nautical and Purse? are more attractive.
And there ate two lightweights with prospects—
Bitalli and Kashmir. Both will go the distance.
* * * *
“0.K.”: No force of assertion, based on
• private information, could compel me -to believe in
the chances of Salitros or Furious (a daughter of
The Welkin) for the coming Sydney Cup. Salitros
had opportunity enough last year to prove himself a
stayer, but in every case this winner of two Derbies
and one Leger proved that he was a much better
horse at 12 furlongs than at 2 miles. David’s
false reputation was based mainly on the fact that
: he twice beat Salitros over a distance, though the
dire failure of the dual Derby winner in both the
Melbourne and Sydney cups should have warned
backers that If mile was the very most he could
travel at his top. Furious thus far has only one
long-distance failure scored against her (in the
Melbourne Cup), but that one failure, sandwiched
between brilliant victories in a Derby and Oaks,
and considered in the light of the fact that no
previous Welkin has been a genuine stayer, although
one or two of them have managed 11 mile, should
give backers pause. Furious is a splendid-looking
mare, yet not the cut of a stayer like Sister Olive,
who receives 31b. from her in Sydney Cup. Olive
is not a brilliant mare, but at least she has
proved herself a stayer by winning a Melbourne Cup
outright and running second in the Australian Cup,
the longest handicap flat race of the Australian
year. Give me Sister Olive over two miles in pre-
ference to the sometimes brilliant daughter of the
Welkin. And for the Doncaster give me Stare in
preference to lighter-weighted three-year-olds. He
was a brilliant colt in the .Spring, and had he not
been running beyond his distance he might have
looked equally brilliant at the recent V.R.C. Autumn
meeting. —•

The connections of the Land of Song
filly, Bassi, are, no doubt, sorry now that she is not
for Rarnlwick next week. She won at Moor ee Val-
ley (Vic.) in a spectacular manner, and followed it
up on Saturday by taking the Aspendale Park (Vic.)
Handicap. She has been starting at 25. to 1 of
late, owing to her “staying” habits at the barrier,
and her trainer was fined £lO the other day for
standing behind her there with a stockwhip.
* * * *
Absurd’s progeny carry all before them
in Maorilard over any distance up to seven
furlongs, after which they fade away. Thus
in Manawatu Stakes on Saturday, Tamatete, out
of Tahua, and Thespian, out of Let a—'both bv
Absurd —ran right away from the dual M.L. Derby
winner, Winning Hit. Though the colt was making
up ground at the finish he failed to catch the second
horse, Thespian, hv a neck. The winner was only a
head away. Desert Gold’s three-year-old sister ran
into a place at the same meeting. In M.L. sporting
circles she is not considered to be her relative’s
“tail.”
* • » «
Punters got a couple of rude shocks at
Newcastle (N.S.W.) on Saturday when Gambler’s
Gold, a hot favorite for the Tramway, ran fourth,
and Sir Maitland, at odds-on, filled a similar posi-
tion in the Wallace Mile. Sir Maitland was thought
to have a fair chance in the Doncaster, but his
unimpressive Rosehill win, followed by his latest
effort against a field of second-raters —he .was con-
ceding King Piedmont, the winner, only 231 b —■
make his chances in the big mile on Saturday look
black.
*. » * *
In addition to the three stipendiary stew-
ards in South Aus., Hogan, Clem Hill and Tom
YVigley, two denuty stipes have been appointed,
Svd Ferry and W. R. Thompson. Ferry, like bis
brother Arnold, was a great horseman, one or
other of them always having the mount on the
many fine jumpers which their father, Seth Fprry,
used to run. “Do your waiting in front” was the
family maxim. Thompson has a great reputation
on courses in the north of the State.
Until Matt Baird, Vic. Chief Sec., dis-
sected it, an application from Bendigo, Ballarat,
Geelong, and Ivyneton Race Clubs for one Saturday
each year seemed reasonable. Then Baird found,
that what was really asked was that he should put
a condition in the annual licenses issued to Metro-
politan unregistered clubs interdicting racing on
the four Saturdays sought by the quartette of
clubs; and looking up from the document he uttered
a cry of “Whaffor?” Whereupon the deputation
owned up that there were not enough bookmakers
to go round ! But they added that if the totalisator
were legalised leading country race clubs wouldn’t
in the least mind metropolitan competition on the
same days.
* * * •
“Saaedi”: It was a bush race meeting, and
six horses struggled past the winning post in a
bunch with the seventh a couple of hundred yards
back. “'Hooray!” yelled the village iniebriate:
“Hooray! I knew ’e’d win! Look at ’im! Look
at ’im ! Cornin’ in on his own! Hooray ! Good
oie feller!” “Garn!” sneered a bystander. “’FA;
not winnin’; Vs runnin’ last.” Anxiously the
blithered one stared up the track. Sadly he turned
to the interjector, and said, “By cripes, 1 believe
you’re right, mister. I thought ’e was winnin'
the (hie) next race.”

The Barbours of Australia are like the
Fosters and Ashtons of England—sportsmen all.
The head of the family, G. P. Barbour, M.A., head-
master of Toowoomba Grammar School, was an inter-
state cricketer,, and he represented Toowoomba
in tennis, cricket and football. I)r. Eric, his son,
played for the Rest v. the Australian XI this
season. Roy, the Q. Rhodes Scholar for 1920, was
an inter-State cricketer and tennis-player before
leaving for Oxford. Fred, who as an undergrad
at Q. Uni. promised to be as good at games as
any member of the family, was killed at the greatest
sport of all.
* » * *
On Saturday, the first day of the last
round of Sydney grade cricket, Waverley, the pros-
pective premiers, met Uni., and looked like putting
the students through for a small score. However,
-Nothling came to his captain’s rescue, and the
side put up 273. Bardsley made a patient 43.
Freeman (50) was the chief contributor to St.
George’s 93, which miserable total was the work of
Asher. Sydney have lost 3 for 149. Randwiek made
221 against Wests, Achurch getting very little assist-
ance. demerger and Wiid divided the wickets.
Marrickville began well against Paddington, but
Goddard and O’Brien (3 for 64) had the batsmen
guessing. When Grant (47) : and Hopkins (44) went
the other wickets fell cheaply. But for Minnett,
Mosman (260) would haye fared badly aigainst
Norths. Hogue, backed by excellent fielding, had
matters all his own way. The Shoremen are 1 for
61. They wiH probably lose the match if Punch
goes cheaply. He’s 27 n.o. Dr. Campling had
Manly batsmen scratching from the jump. They
totalled' 113, Gee (32) being top-seorer. Balmain
have lost 2 for 140 (Wheatley 79 n. 0.). Macartney
(3 for 26), Laurie (3 for 47) and Dive (3 for 19)
divided the Glebe wickets. The whole side were out
for 144. Gordon stand at 4 for 72 (Macartney 32
n. 0.). Petersham look like being one of 0. Cumber-
land’s rare victims. All C.C.’s bowlers were tried
and R. Best got the average (3 for 5). But they
were tail-enders, Coogan (3 for 53) doing most of
the work. B. G. Long (83) top scored for Peter-
sham. Four batsmen failed to contribute. Cumber-
land have lost 3 for 57, but the best batsmen are
to come.

Collingwood again kept Carlton in the
field all Saturday afternoon in the Victorian Pen-
nant semi-final, and the score was lifted from 2 for
268 to 8 for 574. Jack Ryder raised his score
from 151 not out to 267. and L. Keating added 138
to his 59 not out. Prahran against Fitzroy im-
proved from-0 for 35 to 9 for 275, of which Carl
Willis (the A.I.F. batsman) made 85. Fitzroy
scored only 131 in the first innings.
The “glorious uncertainty” of cricket!
In the semi-final of the Vic. Junior Assoc., Rich-
mond City scored 212 in the first innings. Clifton
Hill replied with 196 for four. Then one Parkhill,
who had ■ previously bowled three overs for nine
(no wickets), went on. He took four for none in his
first over, including Robinson, who had scored 74.
Lusch, at the other end, followed with two for nil.
Tims six fell in TO balls for none, and Richmond
City won by 16 runs.
* * * *
In Adelaide premiership cricket individual
honors have been fairly divided, although East
Torrens (as in the three seasons since the war,
and in three of the last four before it) stands
out above the rest as a team. Loveridge (E.T.)
is easily best on the season, with a batting averagja
of 103, and 45 wickets at a shade under 12. Run-
dell (Glenelg) made by far the most runs, 680,
average 85; and Whitty, of the same comparatively
weak club, had the best bowling average, 10, but
he took only 15 wickets. Townsend (Sturt) took
most, 54 at 13, and had a batting average of 36.
Another good all-rounder was Arthur Richardson,
78 and 29 for 16. Willsmore hit the highest score
of the season, 187. Unfortunately all of these are
veterans; of the younger men Rymill did best
(batting average 80), but Geoff Harris, who shaped
so well against the English team last year, was
quite out of form, and there is no definite sign
of a new bowler who can take wickets in first-class
company.

Ex-Englishman”: The comfortable wins
of Cambridge in most sports of late suggest that an
old forecast is being fulfilled. The moneyed classes
oi England, it was argued, would begin to avoid
Oxford when the Rhodes Scholars began to dominate
things there. It is not so much an objection to
mixing with the “niggers” whom many outlying
parts of the Empire elect; Cambridge has a lot of
brown faces too. But most parents would like their
sons to win the highest honors in examinations; and
to get one’s “blue” for any sport whatever is an honor
that counts all one’s life. Why, then, Oxford and
Cambridge being about equal in educational ~nd
social value, go out of one’s way to face the com-
petition of the picked men of the whole English-
speaking race. rveraging two or three years’ advan-
tage in growth and experience over me ireshmeu just
from school, and with a string of past successes to
give them confidence?

Billy McDevitt has dropped out of the
proposed triangular sculling match, and Era West
and Major Goodsell (ex-amateur) will row for a
stake of £3OO on the Parramatta on May 13. The
winner is expected to challenge Ripley for the N.S.W.
championship.

Mosman (N.S.W. champions) licked Bal-
main in the Riverview challenge eights on the
Parramatta, on Saturday. But the margin was only
3ft,, Leichhardt finished a length away third. Bal-
main were;'slb. per man lighter than the winners,
who did the mile in 6min 19 2-ssec.

The phrase, “coming home alone,” is not
often so literally correct as it was in the trial at
Port Adelaide for an eight to represent South Aus,
at Sydney. The matter was left to Murray Bridge
and a combined team from the city. Wind and
waves put the issue beyond doubt. The Murray
men had splash-boards rigged. The seasiders, not
thinkjng much- of the small sea running, did with-
out, and took in enough of the Port River to
sink-them) half-way through. So Murray Bridge
finished alone.

The Tls. crew in the inter-State eights
on the Parramatta next month will contain three
members of one family. Claude Bucirde (stroke)
was in the eight that rowed second to Westralia on
the Tamar last year. Arthur (No. 7), though
younger than Claude, is the veteran of the crew.
This will be the fourth occasion he has represented
the Speck in this event. Reg is making his dfibut.
He is not yet old enough to vote.

Joe Kirkwood did fairly well in the U.S.
open golf championships last week. For the Country
title he finished ninth with* 314, the winner being
Jack Hutchinson (295) and in the North-South cham-
pionship he tied in third place. In the latter
event, finding it impossible to smite the ball right-
handed, he used his mashie in the reverse position
and brought off a 180jds. shot. It is a trick he
has often resorted to in Australia.
* * * *
Manly Autumn record was lifted on Satur-
day by F,. L. Apnerly. who went out 37 and home
in 34, total 71—a figure which equals the club
record. W. ,0. Sturroek returned a 73. Though he only
golfs at - 'week-ends he nr”forms mo T " consistently
perhaps than anyone in Sydney. Ivo Whitton pulled
out of bounds at the first hole, and a seven re-
sulted, and he followed this by a six at the second,
tie returned a 76.
* * * *
The contest at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night was as stirring as it was
foul. Stanley Mcßride began it, treating hi 3
fellow-countryman “Bud” Ridley to a remarkable
assortment of butts, neck-wrenches, palm-hits and
rabbit-killers. Artist that he is he was careful,
usually, to offend on the blind side of the referee,
or to produce the impression that illegality had been
forced on him. Meanwhile his herculean little
opponent was getting more and more annoyed, an
emotion which Mcßride did his best to exacerbate
by jeering remarks and scornful smiles. So Ridley
butted Mcßride and was at once cautioned. For the
first half-dozen rounds Ridley, on whom the betting
was 3 to 1, had looked like stopping the conqueror
of Packy McFarlane; but now Mcßride’s superior
skill and generalship asserted themst lv<«, arm n i
with an occasional devastating uppercut, a straight
left which repeatedly sent Ridley’s head back, and
further fouls, as opportunity offered, the outsider was
the only one in it when the end came. The butt
iir the 12th round which earned Mcßride the decision
did no damage, but it was too crude to be over-
looked. The winner did not wait for the plaudits
of the herd: in fact, he was out of the ring and
safe in his dressing-room before the house rightly
gnew what had happened. A great little ooxer
is Mcßride—which makes it all the stranger that
he does not play the game he knows so well!
* * # •*
Homer nodded, and even .Tamito is liable
to make mistakes. At Melbourne Stadium on Satur-
day night he nit Walter Ros-s when that force.ul
little lightweight was on one knee, and was dis-
qualified. The Filipino was ahead on points at
the time, but he was tired —dog-tired. He has
done enough work in the past six months to wear out
a machine, with the result that he has got stale
and is slowing up.
Paul Deinsky, the lengthy Russo-Austra-
lian lightweight, outed “Wave” Geikie at Brisbane
Stadium on Saturday night with a beautiful right
cross. The former featherweight -'h im non seemed
to have no effective stop against Demsky’s vigorous
methods.
The Springboks ran their last Australian
course at S. Aus. A.A.A. championships at Adelaide
on Saturday. Ayres-Oosterlaak won the 100yds.
(10 l-ssec.) from Bukes and L. V. Pellew; Bukos
the 220yds. (22 4-osec.) ; R. Johnston the quarter
(53sec) ; and a team of four ’Boks took the mile
relay race by 40.vds. in 3min 5.1 s oc. The tour will
leave the S’African guarantors nearly £lOOO on the
wrong side of the ledger.

W. P. Payne (Police) was the outstand-
ing athlete in the triangular club match at Sydney
on Saturday. He won the 161 b. shot putt (37ft. oin.)
and javelin throw (145 ft. 7in.), was second in discus
throw (84ft. 10in.), 76yds. hurdles, and 440yds.,
and was third in the broad jump. Walton Hunt won
100yds. (10 2-ssec.) and 220yds. (24 i-ssec.).
Payne’s effort gave the John Hops the match with
34 points against Y.M.C.A.’s 32.

The re-sail for the Gascoigne Cup; was
staged by Royal Sydney Y. S. on Saturday. At
Long Reef Oenone (J. M. Brunton) hauled a breeze
3Jmin. ahead of Brockhoff’s Scotia, and, picking up
an easterly slant after the first leg to windward,
made the Heads in one hitch. After passing Brad-
ley’s her headsail went wrong, and Aoma came up,
but the limit craft went on to win eventually by
lsee. from Palmer’s yacht. The winner has this
season lifted the Moma, Albert and Gascoigne Cups,
in addition to the big races at the Anniversary am l
Pittwater regattas. No member of the crew is
over 25 years of age.

Mina Wylie collected two more N.S.W.
titles oh Saturday—the 100yds. breast-stroke, which
she took in lmin. 38 l-ssec. (5 3-ssec. out-
side Bananalander Elsie Venning’s world’s record),
and the 150yds. free style, in which her figures
were lmin. 65 2-ssec., or 6 2-ssec. outside American
Charlotte Boyle’s best.

Eleven competed at Coogee on Sunday for
the Annette Kellerman Cup and Medal. Thelma
Lawler (16), of the Metropolitan Club, won in 17min.
29sec., good half-mile figures under the boisterous
conditions. Ida Cummins, her clubmate, was 74sec.
away second. Mina Wylie, who was fourth, did best
time—l4min. 40sec.

The Adelaide to Broken Hill motor record
h»s been badly fractured. The time taken for the
833 miles was from 6 a.m. to 2.58 p.m.; the ear
is an 18-h.p. Overland, and carried two. The
previous time, which had stood for eight years, and
was made by a 27-h.p. car, was reduced by 50min.,
notwithstanding that the record-breakers had the
disadvantage of a frightful dust-storm most of the
way.

Teddy Beard, manager of the touring
bowlirg team, used to be a keen Union football player,
and lately he was treasurer of the Q. Rugby Union.
Also, like his fellow bowler, Alf Faulkner, Mayor
of South Brisbane, he was an inter-State referee.
Despite it all he came under the insidious influence
of bowls, and finally succumbed openly to the vice
of orehid-grovyng, which he had been practising
in secret for years.
• • • •
The averaging-up of bowls in Adelaide
continues. For years it was Adelaide 1, Oval 2, or
vice versa. From 1908 others began to make a
fight for second, and at last, in 1915-16, South Park
won. In 1921 Marryatville butted in to top place;
but this year—South Park 1, Sturt 2—is the only
one on record in which neither of the old clubs
has figured at all.

“Y.Z.”: At a Victorian pigeon-butchery the
other day I discovered the Tender-hearted Man. He
was shattering pigeons like the rest of them when a
commotion broke out among a small clump of spec-
tators, who had discovered a snake, and were busy
killing it with sticks and stones. Tender Heart
joined the small mob. He was indignant. “What
did you want to slaughter the poor creature for?”
he demanded. “It was quite harmless.” His next
shot blew a pigeon’s wing off.

“Rex”: Up Mansfield (Vic.) way there
is an old cocky who has driven his grey mare, now
26 years old, into town for 22 years, never missing
a day, rain, hail or snow. It is 20 miles there and
back, so old Dolly is getting on for 170,000 milef
on that road.

“Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon 1 was astounded
and shocked to see a cricket match in progress. On
his way from Sunday-school an esteemed neighbor of
mine walked along the fence, and as a protest shook
his umbrella at one of the batsmen. The batsman’s
only response was to hit the ball out of the ground.
Can nothing be done?”— Age correspondent.
Within the sinful jazzing hall young men and
maiden; whirl,
And white shirt-fronts hide inky hearts, while each
and ev’ry girl
A budding Messalina is—all holy men know that,
ft is the same where horses race. Leger and stand
and Flat
Are redolent of vice, and even blacker than the turf,
So far as morals go is the illimitable surf.
Now what is that small, sable form which lurks in
furtive wise
By keyhole and by door-crack where the lilting dance-
tunes rise ?
And why does it remain outside and gibber in the
gloom,
And shake its gamp in anger at the dancers in the
room ?
It is the form that you may see from any crowded
beach:
By race-tracks and by cricket grounds it hovers out
of reach;
And as afar it calls on all to stop, in accents tense,
The laughing sportsmen, so to speak, hit sixers o’er
the fence.
Moral.
When Sin set out to teach the world the gospel of
Berlin /
The sportsmen of the Empire very promptly butted in.
But what a world it might have been of wickedness
and woe,
Had they, instead of fighting, waved umbrellas at
the foe!

Actors matinee, got a reception that would
uann old Kosciusko in midwinter. When
she flung one shapely leg over and sat on
the Capulet wall, the house took several
minutes to tell her how glad it was about
u all. Kell was clad in sapphire-blue tights,
a nne lawn shirt, a sapphire-studded sword-
beit and a doublet of blue and ivory brocade.
e 1! i ltt e cameo was framed in a cap
ot blue and white carrying a cheeky iri-
descent feather. She made a winsome
Borneo, and her speaking vo : ce is rich as
ever. (\\ alter Kirby provided the voice in
the song on the other side of the wall before
Komeo clambered into the ivy.) Nellie had
to come back and bow a dozen times at
curtain, and she was pelted with violets
from the boxes and stalls, while a conven-
tional floral heap was being laid at her feet,
i-ier hnal bow was in front of the definitely-
dropped curtain. “Nothing but a dodge,”
she chirruped, “to bring me close to the
footlights, so you may see my wrinkles.”
The matinfie—it was at Her Majesty’s—
brought in nearly £lOOO. The house was
crowded, and it got a comprehensive pro-
gramme for its money. Fanny Wiseman—
that sprightly little actress who still scorns
the shelf—spoke some verses written by Miss
Emmie South on the occasion. But the
most amazing item was the chorus work of
a couple of dozen girls of the Eastern Hill
Lon. They stood in a stolid, solid mass of
white—each with her blue label—and glued
their eyes on conductor Fritz Hart in the
orchestra. There were five chorus songs,
and between each item the damsels neither
smiled nor bowed—they stood shoulder to
shoulder and never fluttered an eyelash. The
curtain fell. after the final number, wiping
them out like a show of waxworks. Per-
haP.s they are still standing there with their
dutiful eves glued on the spot in the curtain-
back in line with Fritz’s baton. Who dared
say that the Con. girls ever played up?
Meenister Marshall, of Scots’ Kirk, was
the locksmith at the Gerald Patterson-
Riggall wedding on the evening of April ‘3.
Auntie Melba, with concert dates in Sydney,
had to substitute presents for presence. The
bride, a bonny little Gippsland brunette,
was gorgeously gowned. Her slim princess
frock was stiff with embossings of pearls
and chenille on a brocade that could stand
alone. A school-pal, Mrs. Campbell, of
Nareen station, lent her a wonderful honi-
ton veil, and this was fixed to a cap made
of real orange buds gathered in Coombe
garden. Three sunny bridesmaids in amber
carried huge basket-bags crammed with
autumn leaves and Fortunatus roses. Vere
de Bavay joined Nellie and Mary Patterson
in this parade, and the bridegroom was
groomed by Jack Wischer, Reg Thomas and
the bride’s brother. There was a gay dinner-
party amid tennis emblems at Scott’s Hotel
with the bride’s father as host and sister
Mrs. Norman Poulton as hostess. Mrs.
Poulton was dainty as a butterfly in azure
blue and gold with a gold band on her hair.
Gerald’s mother, Mrs. Tom Patterson, was
in rich ivory silk with opals banding her
hair. Aunt Mrs. Charlie Mitchell wore a
gorgeous flame-colored gown with ospreys in
her turban, and Mrs. George Patterson
topped a jetted gown with a head-dress of
plumage. Numerous Gippsland relations of
the bride came to town. Mrs. William Rig-
gall, of Dargo. put some lovely black and
gold draperies into the frocking scene, while
aunt Mrs. Keys, from Leongatha, was in
tulle and gold. Norman Ba.vles, Alf Dunlop,
O’Hara Wood and other tennis pals made
speeches, and after dinner there was a
dance on the roof garden at the hotel. At
the finish the bride, dressed in a wonderful
orchid velvet frock and a turban to match,
muffled herself in furs and departed with her
bi’and-new husband.
Gerald Patterson’s bride has for long been
a well-known figure in the Hunt, and her
favorite mount, Grey Steel, has helped her
to win several events.
The Archie Curries’ elder chick, Sylvia,
blushed becomingly on her wedding-day in
white satin and georgette, with an upstand-
ing head-dress of orange blossoms, silver and
lace and a silver-embroidered tulle veil over
all. She and young Kenneth, eldest son
of the late J. C. Svme and Mrs. Syme,
of the Woorangong (N.S.W.) squattage and
St. Kilda, took the plunge at the Collins-:
street Scots’ Kirk on the sth. Little cousin
Fraser Caddy, stepp.ng delicately in white
satin, bore tne bridal train, and sister Kath-
leen Currie and Eunice Umphelby sup-
ported the bride in pale p.nk early-
V ietorian .. skirtings, cascaded with lace
and roses. Hugh Syme attended his
brother, with the aid of Hr. Julian
Smith’s son and heir. Dad handed
over his daughter, and afterwards assisted
his wife to entertain the guests at Millicent,
their Toorak home. The wedding-cake stood
under a ship in full sail—-a model of the
vessel which bore the bride’s grandfather to
Australia.
Anabel, the Herbert Symes’ daughter, is
to be married on April 27 to Alan Gut-
ter idge. Holy Trinity Church, Kew, will
see the ceremony, and there will be a break-
fast at the Studle.v Park home that towers
over the river.
Chancellor MacFarland, of the ’Varsity,
opened a two-days’ Shakspearean pageant in
the Town Hall last Thursday. Prof. Sugden
introduced the Chancellor, and Bill Shak-
speare himself handed him a welcome. After
a costume march round the hall a bazaar
was opened. Julius Csesar sold lollies. The
witches of Macbeth w r ere better suited —they
had a “lucky dip’’ in their cauldron. While
the bazaar raged below Shakspearean scenes
were being presented upstairs by the Mer-
maids. Roman soldiers kept the door. Prof.
Sugden’s daughter was organiser-in-chief of
the affair, which was to help raise £lOOO for
the Queen’s College building-fund.
While the G.-G. was trying to make Syd-
ney via the Prince’s Highway in Gippsland
his car jibbed, and it took some time to
humor it to re-start. While it was being
fixed up his Ex. borrowed somebody else’s
Cizzy and whisked over to Ivalimna West
State School, where Alec Peacock, Minister
of Education, was being lionised at the un-
veiling of a soldiers’ honor-board. As soon
as Lord Forster was spied the Minister
shrank to the dimensions of a lamb, and his
Ex, became the lion. As the G.-G. was
being sped on his way he was to'd that
Gippslanders like Governors who drop in
and take pot-luck like that.
The Stradbrokes, who took to the Prince’s
Highway for their motor drive to Sydney,
struck a tornado at the start, and the most
violent nor’-west wind in years buffeted
them on their run. The north wind has a
boisterous affection for the Earl. When he
tried the new Ocean-road the other day he
was nearly carried out to sea—car and all
—in its violent embrace.
The Austral Salon gave a party to wel-
come Nellie Stewart, x-ecalling many shivoos
in her honor in bygone days. Nellie came
in a little dove-grey frock with some purple
Black Prince grapes weighing down the
brim of her droopy hat. Beside getting
the conventional presentation bouquet, she
was nearly smothered in a heap of flowers
piled upon her by adoring club members.
Mrs. Quinnell gave her a bunch of rosemary.
The club-rooms were crowded, and a musical
programme was turned on with the tea —
Kirby, Mrs. Roy Ashton, Alba Zacutti.
George Cowley and Miss Funston supplying
the melodious noises.
Take a look at Jessie McMichael, who,
during Anne Williams’s absence, is chief sing-
ing teacher at the
Albert-street Con-
servatorium. She
had her soprano
trimmed at the Uni-
versity Con., where
she won an exhibi-
tion, but she has
been teaching at the
Eastern Hill voice-
factory for some
time. Hers is a
striking warble
which she raises on
the Sabbath at
Scots’ Church in a
way that should
bring many a- hard-
ened McSinner to
repentance. The
beauty of it has long
been known to Melba, who gave her some
private lessons, which the songstress natu-
rally regards as a tremendous compliment.
The Monteaih studio made this picture of
the gifted Albert-street teacher.
Allan’s struck the coldest April day on
Melbourne record for their afternoon concert
experiment at the Assembly Hall ; therefore
one’s first impression of public demand for
Wednesday ballad concerts was probably de-
ceptive. The idea is to introduce Allan’s
latest goods to susceptible ears and create a
Wednesday-afternoon habit among folks who
don’t go to theatre matinees, as a rule. Four
singers did their best with a number of bal-
lads, and Nellie Billings and Cecil Parkes
were the instrumental soloists. But far arid
away the most interesting figure on the plat-
form was Benno Scherek, who played accom-
paniments as in days of long ago, when his
hair, so history says, was not less white than
it is now. “To see Benno Scherek.” says
somebody who knew the clever Pole 30 years
ago or more, “is to wonder how young the
old man was when he first came to Mel-
bourne.”
Australia has droves of talented dancing-
girls, but now it has a novice who suggests
a touch of genius—Dorothy Slane, a quiet
little Adelaide girl who, with no thought
of professional life, began her study of danc-
ing in an amateur way only three years ago
under Norah Stewart, of the Holy City.
The youngster is not quite 17, so was only
a baby when Gen£e was here, otherwise you
would imagine she
had stud ; ed that
great dancer herself.
The child often
danced at Red Cross
and Sassiety f@tes for
charity, and Governor
Weigall and his lady
were much inter-
ested in her, but it
is only because she
drifted in to a gen-
eral free-for-all trial
of local talent at the
Adelaide Tivoli that
her light has really
begun to emerge from
und e r its modest
bushel. Spencer
Barry, who “ran”
Gen6e at the Empire
for 11 years, is greatly impressed with the
possibilities in the youngster, and now he
is quietly “nursing her and working out
her individuality,” determined that her
artistic development shall not be rushed. He
put her into a tiny part in a set, “My Lady’s
Boudoir,” which he produced for Harry
Musgrove, just to try her in stage work.
Dorothy was merely “My Lady’s Veil” in the
scene, and had a short dance, but she made
that dance stand out vividly, and those who
know realised that here was “something
different.” The winsome little lass is here-
with pictured for you by Lafayette.
The Austral Salon buzzed the other after-
noon with the presentation party to Maisie
Maxwell. The presswomnn, cleansed of
every trace of ink, was in spick-and-span
brown, from feathered toque to shoetips.
She was handed some Fortune’s Pink roses
dangling from a brown boomerang, and en-
thusiastic women squeezed her lemon-suede
fingers till her hand ached. All the pre-
senters autographed a book placed by Mrs.
Quinnell in the doorway, and then speeches
were flung at the excited girl and a fat
wallet of notes was pressed upon her—“to
buy something when you get to London.”
The. popular young person, who sails in the
Euripides, was almost in tears before the
crowd finished with her.
Harrington Lees is full-fledged at last.
Statist Laughton has registered him as a
minister of religion entitled to bind in wed-
lock. Now Toorak’s daughters are wonder-
ing which of them will be the first bride to
get the episcopal blessing.
Getting in first shot Father John Barry,
right-hand man to Archbishop Mannix, has
obtained from Justice McArthur an order
calling upon the City Council to show cause
why the by-law under which the St. Pat.’s
procession was prohibited should not
be quashed for invalidity. The day
before the Court order was applied
for a majority of the corporation,
led by Cabena, decided to prosecute 25 of
the clerics, legislators and city councillors
who walked in the parade—provided counsel
approved. Having his gun all ready, Father
Barry pulled the trigger. As bitterness is
dying down and the City Council is not very
popular, the Barry-Cabena tussle is being
watched in rather a sporting spirit. There’s
salvation ahead of us when w r e can laugh
at these shadow-sparrings.
After Archbish. Mannix had opened a
bazaar at Kensington the other day, the usual
thanks were being expressed by the suburb’s
best orator. “We are very much indebted
to his Grace for coming amongst us.” he said.
“We are very fortunate to have him, for he
is out every night in the week.” Probably
nobody would have taken any notice had it
not been for the ripple of laughter that came
from a stately church dignitary.
Irvine, C.J., has thrown up his seat on
the Uni. Council, and Latham, K.G., who has
been nominated, seems likely to be his suc-
cessor. We are, therefore, not to have an-
other Lieut.-Gov. as Chancellor in the near
future, as some people had hoped.
The widow McEacharn intends to visit
Melbourne and her old home about Cup-
time this year. She has not altogether re-
covered from a motor accident in London ;
the smash-up has left her rather lame.
One Victorian Judge not long elevated to
the Bench has incurred the wrath of the
gents, one because of what they call his dis-
torted sense of humor. In the Practice Court
the other dav a complicated will ease involv-
ing only £250 was argued by s s x counsel re-
presenting six conflicting interests. ’Sonor,
after giving his decision, said with regard to
costs: “I order that the estate be divided in
the usual way between the solicitors.”
Sam Mackay, who has been on the sick-
list for three months in Westralia, is nt Inst
preparing to return to this city under the
wing of his little wife. Poor Sam is now
minus a leg, amputation having been one
of the incidents of his treatment.
How’s this for a case of love at first
sight? One pretty well known doctor lately
married a girl whom he ushered into the
world, as the polite reporter always puts
it, 20 years ago.
South Melbourne, skipping the middle-
man, is getting close up to the orchardist.
The rush of general market work is broken
by 8 a.m., and the council has made stalls
available from that hour till 12 one day
each week. Orchardists send their fruit
direct to these stalls and sell by the case,
half-case and quarter-case, and people rush
the mart from all quarters with baskets,
prams and barrows. Apples pan out at
about a penny a pound, and grapes, peaches,
pears and other fruit sell at a fraction of
what you have to pay in city fruit-shops.
The councillors are delighted with the suc-
cess of their efforts, and other subbubs are
likely to follow in the good work.
As so far seen in Melbourne Allan Wilkie’s
scenic condensations —his “potted” mount-
ings of the bard, so to speak—are most
acceptable in the tragedies. "Romeo and
Juliet,” played in a series of scenic sug-
gestions rather than settings, with one inter-
val half-way in the journey, is a more diges-
tible entertainment than an elaborate pro-
duction of the gloomy play in four or five
acts. Divested of trimmings “Romeo and
Juliet” doesn’t outstay its welcome. You
arrive at the mausoleum of the Capulets at
a reasonable hour, and surely there never
was a performance of the double suicide
scene less prolonged than you get it in the
Wilkie revival.
The frocks of the Mary bridesmaids were
classical things, by all accounts —the sort
specially made to become heirlooms. They
must have looked like shirts of mail, built
as they were on severe straight lines out of
“frosted cloth of silver” hanging over silver
metal lace. A silver girdle went round each
waist, fastened by a silver rose twined into
a true-lovers’ knot of Mary-blue. The kind
of garment that ought to be hung in the
family gallery along with armor of dead-
and-gone forebears, rather than tucked away
in lavender in an old cedar chest.
Adelaide drops a line.
The other day an avalanche of Victorian M s.R.
and their wives descended upon us. The programme
arranged ran mostly to bowls in the daytime and
billiards at Parliament House in the evenings, with
glimpses at a couple of factories, the abattoirs and
a vineyard by way of educational relief, cricket
against local legislators captained by his Ex., and
races at Victoria Park.
Wintry weather drove the Victoria League’s tea-
party for new settlers from the Government House
garden into the ballroom, where Lady Weigall came
to wish them luck and say her good-byes. These par-
ties are bi-monthly affairs, arranged by the Settlers’
Welcome Committee of the Victoria League to give
newcomers a chance of meeting one another and mem-
bers of the committee that takes them under its
wing. In the past the guests have mostly been
Billjims’ English wives, but now that immigrants
are dribbling in there is a sprinkling of women whose
menkind know as little of Australia as they do them-
selves, and you can imagine What these friendly wel-
comes mean to them.
Polo week brought itself to a hectic conclu-
sion with a g|vmkhana on the Birkalla field, and
Sassiety turned up in force in an array of cars that
made the grounds look like a motor show. Cecil
Bray and his daughter, the R. M. Cudmores and Eric
and Cyril Murray were among the prize-winners.
There are not many polo fixtures in this State with-
out one or other of those names figuring high.
Miss Johnston, whose war work took her to Paris
with the Army and Navy League Club, is the guest
of the Charles Duguids at Magill. In the intervals
of swapping reminiscences with old Digger friends
she is collecting material for the book she plans to
write after her year’s inspection of us.
Gilberton has hit upon a swimming bath as its
war memorial, and the other morning their Exes,
and small Priscilla gave it their benediction. Lady
Weigall has also been to the Royal British Nurses’
Association to say good-bye there. His Ex., by
the way, was on the sick list for a day or two,
and the presentation of the G.-G.’s golf champion-
ship cup to Legh Winser had to be postponed.
Dr. Gertrude Halley’s report of her year’s work
as medical inspector of State schools has one cheer-
ing spot. Last year she was so appalled by the
number of cases of eye diseases in the Far North
that parcels of simple remedies and preventives were
promptly sent up—dark glasses, fly veils, eye baths,
boracic acid, etc—-with “fool-proof” directions for
use. The result, even in 12 months, is marked,
and parents’ indifference and prejudice have given
way to a really keen desire for knowledge and help.
Our undergraduates have been admitted in a body
to a Commemoration for the first time for about 15
years. Their rowdiness in the old days made all
such seriously-intended proceedings farcical, and
Chief Justice Way, then Chancellor, decided on their
exclusion. The present Chancellor, Chief Justice
Murray, is far more popular; and the boys behaved
beautifully, even under the strain of a long farewell
address from Governor Weigall.
A. E. Ford, traffic superintendent of the Tram-
ways Trust, has moved on to Auckland to take over
the management of the system there. Being highly
popular in the service he is leaving, he carries away
much silverware and many good wishes, along with a
presentation set of bowls, bowls being his chief
dissipation.

The Bertram Stevens Memorial Exhibi-
tion drew nearly 400 visitors to Gayfield
Shaw’s Attic one afternoon last week. The
Attic is an irregular eyrie on top of Cal-
laghan House, and capable, of holding about
50 with comfort. But the surplus 300 seemed
satisfied to swelter in the interests of the
arts —at any rate, until after Dame Nellie
Melba, the most striking black-and-white in
the exhibition, finished a eulogy of Bertram
that must have made his shade blush with
confusion, and opened the show in the pro-
perest manner of all by buying three of the
exhibits —Gruner’s 50-guinea “Picnic,”
Hardy Wilson’s 25-guinea flock of “White
Muscovies,” the very pick of the fowlyard,
and Roy de Mestre’s eight guineas’ worth of
zinnias. All the giants of Australian art
were represented on the walls, and many
oozed their fleshly way through melting
wedges of fellow-guests. Norman Lindsay’s
striking-looking wife walked in handsome
silken toggery of tobacco brown, and her
close-fitting hat wore a tender blue plume
that drooped from its under-brim over the
tall lady’s right ear. She received a graci-
ous word or two from the Dame when pre-
sented by Sydney Ure Smith, and later on
studied the pictures in company with Mrs.
Ernest Watt, who wore blue eyes under a
hat-brim lined with a somewhat deeper
shade. Hetty Dymock’s “Waratahs” was
one of the most exclaimed-over bits of
work; and Norman Lindsay’s “Gay Lady
and the Faun” held court all the afternoon.
But the Belle of the Afternoon was Rose
Scott in her feathered bonnet. Everybody
came forward to pay respects to her who
has so successfully blended charm and intel-
lect that it has become impossible to say
where one begins and the other ends. The
naval Dumaresq couple were among the
throng, and Bert Stevens’s old friend Bill
Holman was one of those who came late and
found the cupboard bare of catalogues.
The announcement of the engagement of
the Italian Princess Yolanda, and the heir to
the Belgian throne marks the termination of
the dearest ambition of the Italian royal
family. Italy, unlike France, has been
friendly to Britain for many generations,
and after the war it was hoped that Yolanda
and the Prince of Wales might combine to
make the tie still closer. They were brought
together in Paris by the Italian queen, but
nothing came of it. It was understood that
the religious bar need not be regarded as
insuperable—on the ancient principle (re-
versed) that “a kingdom is worth a mass.”
It is expected in London that the Prince’s
choice will be made known as soon as he
returns from his travels. As in the case
of his sister, the range is severely limited.
The lady must have money, since he has
barely enough to keep himself; she must
have few relations, and these of a desirable
character; and she must have no Jewish
blood. In view of these conditions the field
is narrowed down to a bare half-dozen, all
of them British and commoners.
Admiralty House is to be given a real air-
ing during the winter months. The vice-regal
Forsters took possession towards the end of
last week, and have given out their intention
of living in Sydney until August or Sep-
tember. The dancing-girl is beginning to
go through her togs: she has an idea that
the long visit foreshadows at least one G.-G.’s
ball. At any rate, their Exes, will keep the
Governor Davidsons company on the dais at
St. Vincent’s flutter on Easter Tuesday.
The kindly Commodore Edwards couple
sent invitations broadcast to the Friendly
Union of Sailors’ Wives for what will pro-
bably be their last big gathering at Tresco.
All the commanders who had that afternoon
off and their wives turned up in the pretty
Elizabeth Bay garden, but there was no
doubt in anybody’s mind that the party was
for the lass who loved a sailor and the small
outcome thereof. Rear-Admiral Dumaresq,
who had lent the string band from his own
vessel, made a sincere and touching little
speech regretting that, owing to Mrs.
Dumaresq’s ill-health, he was himself unable
to act host for similar affairs.
Tennis-champion Gerald Patterson is>
honeymooning in Sydney—or, rather, trying
to. Just after he got here, the rumor took
wings that he was an unlikely starter in
Australia’s Davis Cup team this year. Then
began a search for the ’mooners, and when
found Gerald coyly put up the barrage that
his wife had now to considered. Then
Jim Anderson was billed as also unlikely to
make the trip owing to the ties of a wife
and two children. The latest suggestion is
that the Australasian L. T. Assoc, should pay
the exes, of the wives as well as the husbands.
Looking at the matter from the wife’s point
of view, most of the trouble arises from the
old-fashioned division between amateurs and
professionals. AVhy should young men keep
up the pretence of being able to afford to
spend two-thirds of their time on playing-
fields amusing the public? Stage-actors
don’t.
The Soldiers’ Club spread out the “Wel-
come” mat the other morning for the Sena-
torial Pearce couple, who are just back from
Washington. Dr. Mary Booth had parked
some big guns, Church and Military, and the
Club was brimful of sedately-gay visitors.
Mrs. Pearce wore smart navy and grey mil
linery, and the Carpenter had used the
scythe on his Walrus moustache. The party
was mostly kind words and morning tea, the
chatelaine of the club doing the honors.
Dr. Ernest Grigor (in the A.I.F. he was
Colonel Grigor, 0.8. E.) was married last
week to Elsie McCormick. She was the
handsome leading lady in the “While the
Billy Boils” film. They are honeymooning
in Melbourne.
Rosemary Beatrice Gordon and John
Forbes Gordon, the two fascinating mites
of the James Gordons, of Werrawee station
(their mother was a Bowker), are to be
Itossy Lumsdaine’s trainbearers. When the
smali boy was approached about his impend-
ing job he agreed cheerfully. “All right,”
he said, “I’ll hold up the train. But where’ll
the engine be?”
David Jones’ had something new in the
way of fashion-shows last week, and the
only thing lacking was a high-voltage electric
fan to blow a current along the avenue of
display-windows. A long strip of the show-
rooms has been enclosed by aji arrangement
of cream-colored screens to form a sort of
Hall of Fashion. This is carpeted down the
middle, and broken up with standing lamps
shaded in rose, pink and green, and expen-
sive models for street and home attire. Down
each side is a succession of show-windows,
each displaying one or perhaps two crea-
tions. Braid and buttons ornament all the
outdoor models; a little trifle like a cherry
chiffon velvet rest-gown can be had for 17
guineas; and you can buy a navy serge coat-
frock for anything from five to 30 guineas.
The starving children of Europe have won
their way into one big heart, and that beats
in the breast of rosy-cheeked Margaret Thorp.
Margaret hails from Tasmania and is a
Quaker, and it is part of the Friends’ religion
of peace to maintain a company of workers
in any country where war has been. That
is how Margaret was sent to Vienna from
London, where she and her mother were
settled at the moment. Since then the Tas-
manian girl has worked without resting for
the starving and the sick of Europe. She
declares that the relief really reaches the
people it is intended for. During the time
she was at the headquarters of the Society
of Friends at Samara, Russia, only one-half
of one per cent, of goods sent failed to be-
come available for distribution, and the
whole 35 waggons of Australian wheat, the
Commonwealth’s gift to the Friends, was
received. Miss Thorp has a way with her
on the platform, and what she has done to
cheer up the rather languishing Lady Forster
Appeal only the mothers and babies in far-
off lands will ever realise. And they won’t
know the name of the good angel. Gifts in
cash or kind can be sent to the Common-
wealth Bank.
This letter isn’t quite sure whether con-
gratulations or condolences are due to Miss
Preston Stanley.
She didn’t win an
Assembly seat for
the Eastern Sub-
urbs ; but she w*as
thrown out only on
the 19th count under
our headacliey sys-
tem, and not even
Dr. Mary Booth, who
made a gallant fight
in North Shore at
the previous elec-
tion, got quite so
near to Paradise —or
whatever it is. So
another Parliament
will have to struggle
through without half
of the electors being
spoken for by one
of their own sex. Perhaps it had better be
put this way—Miss Stanley has earned the
congratulations and the rest of her sex the
condolences.
Vickery’s Chambers boasts a second Art
Salon. Hitherto the R.A.S. has been the
artistic oasis in that wilderness of Com-
merce. An enterprising Queenslander named
Burdett, an occasional contributor to T?tk
Bulletin’s “Red Page,” has hung out his
sign, furnished a long, narrow room with
the usual rugs and some pretty peacock cur-
tains, and plunged into the art-dealing busi-
ness. The walls are hung with representa-
tive work by Leason, Ashton, McCann, Muir
Auld and others. Some gorgeous book-bind-
ings of Wal Taylor’s are strewn upon a pol-
ished table, the most arresting being a missal
bound in crimson leather, the edges of its
leaves heavily gilt, a mitre tooled upon its
inside cover. This handsome thing is the
property of Archbishop Mannix, who has
loaned it to the binder for exhibition. On
shelves are some bits of pottery in unusual
glazes by L. J. Harvey, a Brisbane crafts-
man.
Mrs. Paddon left for Maoriland last week
to cheer her husband in the race against
Darcy Iladfield for the world’s sculling
championship on the Wanganui on Easter
Tuesday. A big party of Northern Rivers
friefids will also line the bank that day.
Here’s the latest picture of Sydney girl
Ailsa Craig, know*n to London audiences as
Ailsa Grahame. The clever Australian’s
latest achievement was in Dunsany’s plays,
“The Tents of the Arabs” and “Cheeso,”
two of the four works of “the wild Irishman”
produced at Every-
man’s Theatre in
London five months
ago. If Australia
would like to know
what the author
thought of the
girleen’s work here’s
his very note :
A line to thank you
for the great help your
art has given to mine.
Your rendering of Ez-
naraa (“Tents of the
Arabs”) was beautiful,
and you displayed such
a versatility that the
audience would have to
turn to the programme
in order to find any con-
nection between her and
Ermyntrude Slad d or
( “Cheeso” ). — Dunsany.
Ailsa in the not-so-long-ago was a pupil of
Kay Souper’s and a member of the old Stage
Society, and it was in one of this Society’s
productions that she made her first pro-
fessional appearance. She was in those days
a Uni. student and a performing member of
the Sydney Uni. Dramatic Society.
There is a tremendous social hegira in
progress on the steamship lines. That
cheery Irishman Charlie King, of Roma
Downs, who gravitates between the Union
and Brisbane clubs and Brooks’s in London,
is off on the Mantua, and so are the Edward
Knoxes. Mrs. Beaufort Burdekin is leaving
on the Ulysses, partly to visit her family in
England, partly to look after her novel
“Anna,” which John Lane is publishing. And
the whole Burns family is departing via
America,
Mrs. Emily Pelloe is wandering about
Sydney publishing-houses, a hint of iron
behind the velvet of her eyes. The book of
MS. she carries under her arm is not her
own, but the poetic outbursts of a brother
of the pen in Westralia. Mercedes, Darling-
hurst, spreads a roof over the lady and her
husband. Incidentally, a pretty Westralian
over for the Show is Doris Padbury, who
is putting up at the Carlton with her cattle-
king dad. Doris, who is small and fair and
altogether up-to-the-minute, is wearing a
glittering engagement shackle slipped on by
a soldier-fianc-6, Major Olden.
W. R. Fitzsimons, the new Nationalist
member for Cumberland, married a Miss
Clifford Love and is a director of the firm.
He is a Macquarie-street dentist by profes-
sion but a politician by instinct. For years
he has been prominent in the municipal life
of the Kuring-gai Shire, and he has done
great work for the Diggers. A brother was
killed in Gallipoli.
An American Columbus who discovered
Australia a month or two ago got off at last
with an Australian literary young man to
write up his log; but he had some tiring
experiences first. He sent for, among others,
a well-known Brisbane penwoman. and set
the prapersition before her: would she put
in four eight-hour days on his boat and write
a book for his wife? They would tell her
just what to put down. “Oh,” she said,
“you want a stenographer*, not a literary
woman. You’ll get one at a business college.
Good day.”
George Reid’s widow has opened a bonnet
shop in Oxford-street, London. At the pre-
sent price of headgear she should be able
to replace the recently-stolen pearl neck-
lace quite soon. She has been staying with
daughter Thelma (Mrs. Cleaver) in her flat,
a stone’s throw away from Tussaud’s.
There’s one little woman, anyway, who
thinks Caruso’s voice was mere tinkling
brass compared with tenor Sid Macdonald’s.
She is an invalid from childhood, and
through Sid’s recent generosity she will
be able to furnish a small home. The popu-
lar singing-man not only arranged a concert
at the Conservatorium to help her along the
track, but paid the exes, out of his own
pocket, so that all the gate-money might go
into chairs and tables and kettles and pans.
Pianist Charles Philip and the pupils of
Golden Grove helped out the programme.
Violinist Muriel Buchanan, who got her
first lessons under Vost Janssen’s careful
eye, and later on became a pupil of Jenny
Cullen’s at the Conservatorium and has been
a member of the Orchestra since its birth,
has more than iustified her early promises.
The other day she was awarded the Teacher’s
Diploma at the Conservatorium, and is the
first student in the Violin Section to gain
the distinction.
Monsignor Rella, who will conduct the
Sistine Choir on its Australian tour, is
one of nine experts who decide all questions
of musical taste in the Eternal City. He
was formerly professor of music in the North
America College at Rome; but his greatest
success has been in the guidance of these
Sistine Choristers. The variety of the Aus-
tralian programmes will give him an
adequate opportunity for the display of his
genius.
Arrangements have been completed this
far: the monster ball in aid of St. Luke’s
is to be held on May 18 at the Palais in
Moore Park. A meeting of sub-committees
was called at Government House the other
morning, and, her Ex. being still in Goul-
burn, the Wade lady took the chair. Dame
Margaret is president of what is surely the
biggest working-bee on record; Mrs. Roy-
ston Davey and Frank Lamb are facing the
perfectly-appalling secretarial work, while
Mrs. Hugh Denison and Mrs. Spencer Brun-
ton are in charge of the box-office.
The patients at Waterfall write in jubila-
tion over the cinema show that the Red
Cross supplies them every fortnight, and of
the stencilling class that is the latest and
most welcome addition to the Women’s
Hospital. There is even talk of making a
bowling-green for the use of the patients. Yet,
spite of all the new entertainments, patients
still retain the loud hand for the Amateur
Concert Party, their first friend, which has
never failed them.
Last Sunday the very small son of a very
fashionable mother was taken to church and
placed in the pen beside the tiny daughter
of an equally stylish mother. Going
home the first mother asked her precious
how he had liked going to church. “It
was very nice,” he said politely. And then
with enthusiasm: “And I liked that little
girl. I told her” —this with great pride—
“how much of my clothes I could undo now,
and she told me how much she could undo
of hers.”
No bag-snatcher would have seriously con-
sidered the trifling black-and-white satin
affair dangling from Ruby Coxhead’s arm the
other afternoon, and yet that bag held £5OO.
Of course it was in a cheque, and it goes to
endow a cot in perpetuity at the Renwick
hospital for babies, in the name of the
Vagabonds. This cheery group of amateur
players has supported a cot for some years,
while it has been also piling up the endow-
ment fund. Ruby, who is the leading spirit
in the club, made her way by tram to the
Thomas-street office of the institution, unob-
trusively slipped the cheque into the cashier’s
hand, and then joined a few of the officials
in a tea-drinking.
You couldn’t want a more striking proof of
the hard times that have come on many of
those who before the war were affluent than
the little colony of oyster-fishers at Port
Stephens. Its members are not there for fun,
yet they number some who a while ago were
well-known clubmen, and at least one soldier
of high rank. Being still amateurs they
are making the usual little mistakes. One
of the syndicate was sent to Sydney to buy
some sort of a craft for negotiating the
shallow waters, and being more of a horsey
man than a seafarer he returned with a
stately craft capable of crossing the Tasman
Sea to compete for the Joseph Ward Cup.
The tall Miss Nixon, who is a pillar of
the Handicrafts Society, has patented a
cleaner for suede shoes. The article is about
the size of a matchbox, can be slipped into
the handbag, and is likely to become as
indispensable as a powder-puff.
A North Sydney woman just returned from
India advises wives to thoroughly investi-
gate the conditions of living and sterling
value of salary before allowing their obedient
husbands to sign any agreement of service
in those parts. Life in “the East” isn’t life
in Australia. Snobbery runs riot there, and
unless Australians happen to have cash to
play up on club life and polo they have
a slow time. Most English firms when em-
ploying their officers insist that they be club
members and make a handsome allowance
on the salary- Australian firms with repre-
sentatives in Asia rarely do that, and the
Australian is lucky who has saved enough at
the end of his agreement to pay his wife’s
fare back home.
The Royal Hospital for Women is going
to cover some of the seven acres of old gar-
den and lawn with more buildings. In this
wonderful obstetric hospital something like
6000 women are treated every year. But
growing population means growing responsi-
bilities, and the old institution is forced to
expand. The plans for the new block are
being prepared by Spain and Cosh ; and all
the public is asked to do for the present
is to contribute £50,000. And that’s not so
much as it sounds when you remember that
the hospital has been working for 100 years
in the cause of motherhood.

Old Timer: Inclined to agree with you
In part; but what that man wrote was based on 30
years’ professional dealing with that class, mostly in
a public capacity.... T. A. W.: Your ' writing lacks
arrangement. Don’t shake out your facts like pepper
from a pot. Marshal them S.E.A.: It’s sad dog-
gerel. .. .W.C.: True, this paper said “There cer-
tainly should always be room for one straightout
R.C. member in five.” But that was under a system
of sectarianism which it was cursing G.L.S.:
You have misread him Toto B.: It won’t do.
Even the dictionary is a poem if rhythm doesn't
count and if it doesn’t matter how far you go before
you come to a rhyme.... Marguerita: We’ve almost
worn out our eyes looking' for verse from that
quarter. And it doesn’t come—of printable quality.
.... Married Man: That carries it over the border;
the discussion was on the edge .... Ernest C.:
Very close up.... Quentin P.: Well done ; but too
close to Mrs. Forrest W.E.1.: Too much time
spent over preliminaries. Cut out the cackle and
lay the egg.... Titvvillow: “Consolation” will come
1 in here as well as anywhere:—
Dear comrades, don't get heated
f Or let your talk be rash;
Though we have been defeated,
I sit behind the cash.
We talked a jolly lotta
■ Abominable rot;
Still I’m a wealthy squatta.
And stick to what I’ve got.
So you can go to glory,
I’m Mister now, or Sir,
And not like poor Jack Storey—
Yours dooley, Greg McGirr.
Hematite: Think you’re wrong. It’s name is Mud.
... .Cecil M.: Both thought and workmanship fail....
Paul V.: Nothing there. Hardly ever is in verse
labelled “Wanderlust” Thelma F.: It couldn't
say much less. .. .R.H.R.: Poor verse without
thought... .Becky: The “Rose” is rather tired....
J.K.8.: Sawn out of a block in old Commonplace’s
timber-yard... .1.R.E.: Only says what has been
said better... .Roscoe E.: The dog is a tedious
brute....Jo: You have some verse sense, but the
lines you send lack freshness Manuka Bush: It
follows an old track that has many returnings. ...
F.R. (Bowen): Not enough story.... Bay W.: Mov-
ing-picture rubbish ...■. W.M.F.: Not well enough
done... .R.F.S.: All of them too thin... .H.W.8.:
Read the paper. We want what we print and always
want it a little better Wilfrido: Too rugged....
R.G.T.: The verse is not good enough; and the ideas
>re thin and overworked P.F.F.: “Grotter” is tod
mechanical.... G.M.L,: Wanted a lighter touch....
E.H.G.: Even in its altered form it doesn’t thrill...
J. T.S.: Not for us. . . .E.W.H.: Not enough meat on
its bones. .. .D.V.K.: Moves rather heavily.... Don
Three: “Ginger” doesn’t make a yarn. .*.Douglas
E.: Don’t like it.... X-ray: You make nothing of
vour chances.... Eax’lam T.: Far too long-drawn-out
for the small thing it is H.E.R.: “Sharkey”
must go home. . . .Mool B.: Wanted brighter hand-
ling....E.B. (North Quay): Doesn’t ring true....
Norman R.: More picture-show stuff.... A.L. (Point
Cook): Rather thin and poorly written Binnie:
“Rose” not for our bouquet. .. .Kathleen B.: The
garden doesn’t bloom Gus: Put some better work
fnto it... .Michael F.: “Phryne” has strength but
not much freshness) Hie verse hardly carries it...
R.F.S.: Too slight... .R.S.A.: Send it to a boys*
paper....L.C.R.: Don’t like “Conscience”... .E.C.
(Roma): Mixed and muddled.... Ole Blue: Nice
sentiment, but the handling is poor Tiny: A
playing with word's, and you don’t understand that
game... .Penpusher: Nothing there. .. .Barwon: No
reason Why with practice you should not write that
verse at the rate of a hundred lines an hour for 48
hours a week.... W.T.G.: Four lines, and you ask
what, we think of them: —
Lucidity of thought in rhyme,
With power to make or mar, sublime,
Shall even unto those be given
By urging voice of music driven.
We give it up. . , .C.E.'T.: Very lumpy and ending on
a stump-splitting discord G.T.E.: Poor
P.A.L.: Undertaking yarn has been told before....
J.M.S.: “Black Opal” is not bright enough....
L’Enfant: Not quite enough in “The Cure”-....
A.W.P.: Even in writing poetry it is a? well to
draw your plans before you build your castle....
R.C.M.A.: It has a hint of reality, and you ought to
do more work on it... .H.R.V.: Rather an old tale;
but there have been worse first attempts. .. .Tom A.:
Not nearly.... Shene B.: The grim yarn isn’t con-
vincing... .G. A.H.: Many replies have appeared.
“Salisbury Plain” is not for us... .F.P.S.: You have
our sympathy; but the screed won’t d 0... . John T.:
“Mr. Sirrah” doesn’t hit us. .. .E.N.H.: Both miss.
.... S. J.S.: Consider:—
O ghost of a pale love sighing,
Death sighs in a bleeding heart;
O ghost of a lost love crying
Against oblivion’s smart.
Can’t make those pictures fit... .Fanuela: The sonnet
is lumpy and its meaning obscure... .L.M.K.: Poor
verse that gets to nothing.. . .John A.: There is
something in the tale ; try to get it on to paper. . . .
N.G. (Armidale): You have the color, but have not
developed the skill... .Ethel: Parodies are like pan-
cakes—fifty bad for every one that's tolerable. Yours
is with the crowd.... Gwendoline H.: Can’t see much
resemblance to a “boudoir cap” in the collection of
old rags.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) !
CORRESPONDENTS.
Bulky B.: You try to crowd in too much. "Hey
Diddle Diddle” is the best, but we’ve used it in the
same connection... »E.D.: Ansemic wash on bad draw-
ing .... W.M.: A miss.... A.L.: Will use 0ne.:...
W.li.H.: A horrible mix-up... .E.M.F.: Does Flo
really entertain her friends in that costume?....
C.F.P.: No draughtsmanship... .G.E.N.: Some pro-
mise, but he needs tuition... .H.G.: Lifeless... .P.H.:
Not within coo-ee K.F.: May do as suggestion.
. ...M.L.: Art is long, but you needn’t have given
the artist so many feet as that.

Be a REXONA GIRL!
It means Health and Beauty.
“I have been using Rexona Skin and Facial Soap, and wish to add my testimony
about same,” writes Miss Edith Pickup, Orange Street, Eastwood, N.S.W. “It is a
wonderful soap for the skin and hair, and 1 cannot imagine how I ever got along
without it before. It keeps the skin so soft and clear, and is so delightful to use;
and for my hair I never had anything like it, for it makes it soft and glossy, and
keeps? it in perfect condition.
“Often I have had occasion to use Rexona, the Rapid Healer, also, and 1 can
truly say that it is a wonderful Skin Remedy. I will ever be a friend to Rexona,
and shall always recommend it to all my girl friends.”
WHY NOT ENJOY A GOOD COMPLEXION?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin of the face. When you wash
your face do you realise that it is not enough simply to remove the dirt, but that your
skin needs a soothing, healing influence to keep your complexion fresh and tree
from blemish?
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap
is not only an absolutely pure
soap, but is medicated on the
same principle as the famous
Rexona Ointment, which is
noted throughout Australasia as
the Rapid Healer.
That is why Rexona Soap
really does for the skin and face
what cosmetics are supposed to
do, by ensuring not only a clean
face but. a pure and healthy
skin, and thus gives you a clear
complexion.
Care for yourself by using
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and
Rexona Soap, and your skin will
reflect the improvement from the
first, and you will delight your-
self as well as your friends.
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, 1/6 and
3/-. Rexona Soap, 1/- per tablet.

Experience.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Experience her zither took
And with a lonely, lowered look
She played me many a storied air
Of dreams that maids were wont to share
In Tempe and in Arcady.
She played them here for me.
At times the strings seemed hearts on fire,
Then they were mixed with lorn desire.
And ever they were sweet as death
Dying upon a lyric breath.
“Give me,” I said. And oer the lute
I bent with lips and fingers mute.
I cried: “There is not any string
To which my woman-soul can sing.
I smote them with my eager hands.
Oh, what a wail of sound from lands
Enchanted, terrible and fair
With mystery and sin, was there!
I broke the strings. I heard them sob
With sickening, sorrowful, wild throb.
I gave her back her instrument •
She looked at it in mild content,
And on the shattered zither smiled
And played the rose-notes of a child.
N.S.W.
ZORA CROSS.
The Adorable Winky.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BUT the adorable Winky really fills
up so much of my time that I
won't be able to see you till Satur-
day. So please, dear, send me another
letter; it is such a joy to get one that I
really feel tempted to hug the postman that
brings it.”
Joiiu Newbery woke, lingering on the
words with a strange ecstasy. They were
part, he knew, of a tong senes of intimate
letters irom a girl he had met by cnance.
What was the name ? Belle —Belle —ah, he
had it; Belle Hinton! She had come into
his lonely liie with unheralded suddenness,
as all good things come, and the long pro-
cession of quaint missives that passed be-
tween them filled the gaps between personal
meetings, prolonging these points, as it were,
into a delightful line. For a moment he
poised half-awake, lingering on the tender
absurdities of that last letter, its huggable
postman, and Winky. Then suddenly he
awoke completely to a cheerless dawn—a
bitter, disappointed person of middle-age
struggling vainly with the remnants of a
dream. There was no girl—there were no
letters, Winky, postman, love or regrets.
His dull, grey life stretched from his school-
days to the present moment, equally empty
of fantasy and romance. And yet surely
this memory was not altogether a dream?
The quaint details* still lingered ; they grew,
if anything, brighter and clearer as sleep
departed. He lay awake pondering the inti-
mate phrases of that last letter —a letter to
which he could now never reply.
Morning actually sharpened the recollec-
tion of this strange “affair” that apparently
only existed in a fourth dimension of his
mind, and John Newbery, feeling a queer
happiness, attacked the dreary routine of
his work with a song at heart. As the world
runs, a “failure” in creative effort, he eked
out a precarious existence as a humble
hanger-011 of the arts or odd-jobman of
letters. He read manuscript, reviewed
books, copied music, typed stories. Self-
expression—after a series of dismal ex-
periences in writing, drawing and music—
he had shelved with his vanished youth. He
led a quiet, slightly-embittered existence in
a “residential” suburb, renting a tiny room
from a typical landlady, who resented his
untypical quietness and waited hopefully
for a “breaking-out.” “Still waters run
deep, Mrs. Finnerty,” she confided to her
neighbor over the fence. “Them quiet sort
is always the worst. Drink, wimmin, or
suicide—’e’s rloo for one of ’em. ’E’s got
that queer lately, singin’ to ’imself an’ wot
not. I’m sure it’s whisky; but ’e’s that
cunnin’ I never see a bottle anywhere.”
Meantime John Newbery lived in a dream-
world apart, peopled by Belle Hinton, a
series of love-letters, and “the adorable
Winky.” He had taken the theme and em-
broidered it with many variations, guesses
and theories of his own. He liked best that
which imaged her as a young and beautiful
widow, and Winky as a delightful toddler
of two. Into the gloom and chaos of this
beauty’s bereavement leapt John Newbery
like a knight in flashing armor to reawaken,
to console, to arouse, amuse, attract, and,
last, to love.
And then he met her.
Resting one soft spring morning in the
Botanic Gardens, building extra wings and
towers to his everlasting castle of dream,
John Newbery became vaguely aware that
someone had taken possession of the other
end of the seat he occupied. Then a girl’s
clear voice spoke, and he became very thor-
oughly awake.
“Now, Winky, you must sit still and be-
have yourself like a good dog.”
A girl, quite young, with a face queerly
attractive and mischievous, addressed a
Pomeranian that frisked about her feet
uttering tiny, impatient barks.
John Newbery started as if at an electric
shock, sprang to his feet, and gasped out
“The adorable Winky!”
“That’s what we call him,” answered the
girl, staring at him frankly. “He is rather
a dear, don’t you think?”
“B-b-but I’ve dreamt about him —and
about you!” stammered Newbery in a haze
of rioting emotion. “Why, I”
“How do you know I haven’t dreamt about
you, too?” smiled Winky’s owner, watching
him with an enigmatical gaze. A skilful
analyst might have found a strange blend
of surprise, pity, mischief, watchfulness,
mirth and dissectiveness (to coin a word)
in it, but Newbery was far too amazed to
notice. His dream was coming true.
“You are Belle Hinton,” he said at last,
struggling out of a happy stupor.
“Yes.” laughed the girl, still watching
him quietly. “I am.... Belle Hinton.”
That pause might have warned a follower
of Freud; Newbery, scorning psycho-analysis
as he scorned jazz, flying and motor-cars—
innovations since the “good old days” in
which his youthful memories lived—missed
it. Joyously he set out to confirm the iden-
tity of his maid of dream, and found it
easy. Their dreams corresponded. Some-
where in the universe the vast machinery
of Fate had been set in motion to bring
two human beings together. They discussed
the matter at length—a fervid and happy
discussion it was for Newbery, and when
at length they parted, the promise of imme-
diate correspondence by letter remained, and
sang within him like' a chime of bells as
he watched the adorable Winky and his mis-
tress fade amongst the traffic of a city
street. «
John Newbery went home walking upon
air. Never was the sky bluer, the sun softer,
the wind kinder. Lumbering motor-drays
took on a romantic aspect, telegraph-poles
became beautiful. • A small dog—a glorious
animal —barked joyously round his feet. A
soft-eyed cat put up its head for fondling
and purred. He reached home intoxicated
with happiness. And his landlady took a
mental note of it with prophetic satisfac-
tion. “Sozzled,” she whispered to her neigh-
bor over the usual gossiping-place. “I know
it —’e’s taken to it at last.”
The letters were an everlasting joy. What-
ever shortcomings Belle possessed as a
keeper of appointments (she, usually broke
them) were more than balanced by her vir-
tues as a faithful correspondent. Her letters
were bulky, voluminous. Their quaint
range of subject and emotion roused a spirit
of emulation in Newbery, and for a brief
dazzling period postmen delivered daily let-
ters at both ends of this connecting-line of
Fate. Then came Doom. A quite curt
missive from Belle announced her sudden
departure for America within the week : “It’s
just a terrific rush to fix things up, so I
can’t possibly see you; and it’s no use writ-
ing till I find out my future address.”
John Newbery staggered under the blow.
Leave him? Belle Hinton—his fated mis-
tress of dreams? It could not be. But how?
Ah, he had it. He would write a letter
such as no man had written before and no
woman could resist. Perhaps it was qll a
test of his faith; perhaps he had not ex-
pressed his love with clearness. It was
Sunday: he had the whole day in front of
him and a glorious writing-fever in his veins.
He sat down to his writing-pad and began.
Early in the afternoon, however, Fate
came stumping in, disguised as the landlady
with a huge bucket, a broom, a cloth, car-
bolic soap and a general atmosphere of
battle, contempt and rage. “We’re picnick-
ing at Bondi ter-morrer, Mister Noobery,”
she shouted stridently, “so I’m jest runnin’
round th’ rooms to-day instead. What say?
No, I won't go away—it’s potter be done.
If yer don’t like it, do t’other thing. Hout
of it now, an’ no nonsense—you can come
back again in ’bout an hour.”
With a muttered curse John seized his
hat and sought the door. For a long while
he wandered aimlessly about suburban
streets, his mind revolving majestic phrases
for his final missive. At last, finding him-
self at the foot of the hill in the little park
at Bellevue, he climbed to the top and sat
gazing abstractedly out over Bondi beach
and the ocean.
Then suddenly on a gust of wind voices
reached him. Two persons—girls evident'y
—were talking to each other in the little
boarded-in shelter where a band sometimes
played.
‘‘But how ever did you run across him?”
asked the first voice.
“Oh, he spoke to me in the Gardens once,
and I couldn’t help pulling his leg. Called
me Belle Hinton, whoever that was, and
knew Winky’s name. Said he’d dreamt it
and a lot of other rubbish, and got me to
promise to write. I don’t suppose it’d have
gone any further if I hadn’t said something
about it before the kids, and they were mad
to butt in and answer his letters, so I let
’em. Doris is a clever little beast for all
she’s only 18, and Jack was, of course, in
his element. They’re going back to school
to-morrow, so I wrote and choked him off.”
John Newberv’s soul had descended swiftly
into Hell as this speech of his beloved’s
reached him, yet a horrible fascination kept
him anchored to the spot.
“But how did he come to know of Winky?”
“Can’t say, dear. Father named Winky
after a dog in some volume of ‘A Woman’s
Love-Letters’ that were fashionable over 20
years ago.”
With a gasp Newbery saw in a flash the
origin of his dream; but the voices con-
tinued mercilessly.
“What was he like, Gwen? Was he good-
looking?”
“Lord, no—the most awful specimen you
ever saw. Why, he was half-bald. And his
clothes! I don’t believe he’d a cent to bless
himself with. One of his eyelids was hiarher
than the other. The kids used to load their
letters with flattery, but among ourselves
we used to call him ‘the Adorable Blinky.’ ”
It was enough. The Adorable Blinky
was stumbling down the hill like a drunken
man, with the tattered remnants of his
dream streaming about him. At the foot
he collapsed, hid his face in his hands and
groaned. A number of cheery bandsmen,
struggling uphill with their instruments,
gathered about him in a sort of envy. At
last a cadaverous horn-player shook him by
the shoulder.
“Where’d yer get the beer, mister?” he
queried hoarsely.
The question acted as a goad. John New-
bery staggered away on through the streets
blindly towmrds his home. A small dog
approached him joyfully and met a savage
kick; he thrust a friendly cat off a fence
with a curse. The streets were sown with
the ugliest things on earth —telegraph-poles.
A stray boy, passing, sheered into the
gutter at the homicidal glare in Newbery’s
eyes. And Newbery would very willingly
have killed him. The landlady, scrubbing
the verandah as a final effort, watched the
blundering approach of her boarder with
malignant satisfaction. Drunk on Sundays
now, and all in a short half-hour. Ah, them
quiet, sneaky kind was always the worst!
John Newbery went straight up to her and
spoke in a voice that was strangely toneless
and low. “Mrs. Benson,” he said, “if I
offended you in any way by ray language
when you sent me from my room, I wish to
apologise. You happen to have unwittingly
rendered me a service which I shall remem-
ber all my life—damn yon!”
And he stumbled up the ricketty stairs,
leaving the landlady collapsed on her pail.

Slasher’s Second Chance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HARLEY SING LEE kept a shop
J over on Ross Island. At any rate
his name appeared above the door.
Sam Hing made a daily round with fruit
and vegetables, and helped in the shop at
nights. The two slept in one small room at
the back. The beas were two benches
against opposite walls; a thin fibre mat
and a blanket on each were all the bedding
a coolie required. Nails on the walls, a
small table and the floor were alike crowded
with a medley of useful articles and rub-
bish.
One morning Sam Hing awakened a long
time before Charley. Throwing off his
blanket he arose. Taking off his boots at
night prepared Sam for sleep. Butting
them on and lacing them prepared him for
the day. There were special occasions when
he washed; this morning was not one o£
them.
Having laced his boots, he straightened
up; then he leaned over to bump Charley
into another day’s work. The bump was
never delivered. Sam .stiffened like a setter;
a momentary nausea swept over him ; then
the stoical calm of his race enfolded him
again. Charley Sing- Lee was dead, dead
of the plague; the few r exposed parts of his
flesh gave ample evidence.
Horrors were so often the commonplaces
of life to his kind that Sam Hing felt no
emotion, except some trifling satisfaction
that this or some other devil had not yet
seized him.
Sam recalled that the white men said
this devil was carried about by rats. Surely
that was foolishness past belief. Had not
he and Charley burnt two sticks and a
special charm against- rats in case the white
men were right? And, lo ! Charley was dead.
So it was not the rats.
Besides, there were only a few rats about
their place; it was not as if they were
always getting under foot.
But now he must know what to do at once
or else he would be in trouble with this
white man’s law, which was forever saying
do this and don’t do that, in ways too
strange to understand. Putting on his hat
he passed out of the back door, locking it
behind him. Twenty minutes later he had
crossed Townsville’s Victoria Bridge, turned
west along Flinders-street and entered the
warehouse of Quong Yee. A bumble re-
quest, delivered to another of his sort,
brought the master from the rear of his
premises—a shrewd, bland, masterful mer-
chant, son of many of his kind before him.
Sam Hing told of his awakening.
Quong Y'ee appeared somewhat annoyed.
“You will go to the police station near the
shop, Sam Hing, and tell them you
awakened and found Sing Lee even as you
have said ; but you will not say you have
been here. They will take away that which
was Sing Lee and bury it in haste; you they
will take to their place for sick people, to
see if you suffer from the plague. Take what
they give you ; when you are free to depart
come again to me.”
In this manner another plague death was
duly reported.
Even as Quong Yee had said, the body was
hurried away, Sam was hustled into quaran-
tine, and the shop was closed, to be fumigated
on the morrow.
Quong Y'ee and Slasher Dean met near the
Ross Island end of the Victoria Bridge. It
was entirely Slasher’s fault. Had he not
been shuffling along morosely, w r ith lowered
head, had he only looked up thirty seconds
sooner, a nearby hotel would have been his
refuge, and there would have been no meeting.
A stickler for certain niceties of inter-
course was Slasher. Uuder given condi-
tions he held it to be highly indecent to meet
certain people. Quong Yee was one of those
persons ; the conditions had their origin six
months previously.
“Never mind. The cow can’t start any-
thing—l’ve got too much on him.”
Moved by this consolation Slasher stared
stonily ahead and prepared to pass without
a sign of recognition. But Quong Y'ee stepped
slightly in front of him. “Slasher,” he said,
“I would like to speak to you privately for a
few minutes.”
“Gwan, I’m listenin’,” Slasher mumbled.
(The neck of the Chow, talking just like a
school teacher!)
“Allow me to reassure you. Slasher, I have
no wish to say anything unpleasant. I wish
only to speak of possible future relations.
But we can scarcely do so on this footpath,
can we? Come over here.”
Slasher followed him off the bridge.
Six months previously Slasher had received
401 b. of opium from Quong Yee for distribu-
tion to various parties at Huglienden and
points further west. Instead of ihaking de-
livery he had sold out, at cut prices, and
bolted south, via Winton and Longreach;
patting fondly a wad of notes totalling about
£4OO.
“Slasher, needless to say,. I felt your
treachery bitterly.” *
Dean looked surly ; he was no coward, in
the ordinary sense, yet he did not care to
start-anything with this particular Chow on
slight provocation.
Quong Yee went on, quietly; “I am only
surprised at your lack of perspective. You
are short-sighted. True, you made a few
hundreds where I was paying you only
eighty; but consider the number of times I
employed you, the number of fifties, eighties
and hundreds you made in the course of a
year. Owing to your relations with me, for
four years you were the flashest spender in
Townsville. The ladies of Flinders-lane
adored you; the best bars in town wel-
comed you. Who so flash in dress as Slasher
Dean? Even the common rubbish, the beer-
hums, have missed you. Was it not foolish
to descend from such an eminence for a mere
flash in the pan? For it is evident that you
have descended. Your clothes are such that
any of my coolies would hesitate to wear
them, and I can say nothing worse than that
of them, can I? I doubt whether you have
the price of a drink in your pockets at this
moment.”
Dean’s mounting rage at last burst out in
fury; Quong’s picture of both past and pre-
sent was so true that it bit into him like
acid. “What you cornin’ at?” he asked.
"I am coming to this. We will wipe out
the past and .consider it finished.. For two
good reasons. Firstly, you have suffered,
you are suffering severely, for your mistake.
Secondly, 1 have not since been able to find
anyone as clever as you in your work. I
dare not take risks with* bunglers, and you
never bungled. I feel certain that, if you
had another chance, you would never again
risk poverty and dirt by letting me dowm,
would you?”
“My oath, I wouldn’t.”
Visions of the old prosperity crowded
Slasher’s brain —-indulgent ladies, cool bars,
off-hand bets, money to toss about, ear-
biters to patronise, glorious life again !
“Give me another cßance, Quong! Strike
me dead if I ever twist, on you again.”
“I do not think you will, Slasher. Any-
way, I need you for my own sake. There
is much work on hand. I will give you your
hands full very quickly, trust me.”
Slasher had become one wide grin of
humble goodwill.
“When do I begin, Quong? Make it soon.”
Quong Yee smiled with great amiability.
“I felt sure you would meet me in the
right spirit. Our first care must be not to
let the police see you any more in that
clothiug. Have you been in the town in
that filthy condition?”
“No; I just came off the Murgana at th’
jetty wharf. Came up as trimmer. Nobody
seen me yet”
“That is fortunate. I suggest that you
take this pound, slip into these shops and
get some food ; go into the hotel and get a
bottle of whisky, and I will put you on to
a snug place where you can keep quiet until
to-morrow. That will give me time to get
you a complete outfit of decent clothing.”
“That’s fine, Quong!”
The merchant handed him the pound note
and Slasher soon purchased a few shillings’
worth of food and tobacco; the whisky took
more time to buy. But Dean did credit to
himself in emptying four pots of beer while
the bottle was coming.
“All get, Quona-.”
The Chinaman led the way along the main
street, turned into a side street, then fnto
an alley and up to a back door, which he
unlocked. Inside the place he motioned
Slasher to enter a small room.
“Stop in that room, Slaslmr. This is one
of mv shops. The manager has gone to
Ayr, or further. If any of his assistants
come in, mention mv name; tell them to see
me. If I see any of them about town, I
will tell them. You are going for big tilings
again, so no petty theft; keep out off the shop
and storeroom ; stay here. It is only a coolie
pigsty, but you have no good clothing to be
spoiled. Don’t move about and have the
neighbors take you for a burglar so that I
will have to anpear in this—that will be
no good for our other business. Make your-
self as comfortable as you can and give me
until this time to-morrow.”
With a friendly good-bye Quong passed
out.
“You’re a sport, Quong,” was Dean’s part-
ing as the door was locked again.
Slasher wasted no time in putting the
pigsty in order. A billy of w r ater and a
pannikin were right in sight; the father of
all thirsts had not been satisfied by the four
paltry pots of beer. Desire and opportunity
were in tile bottle of whisky. Like a master
strategist Slasher, placed himself on one of
the coolie benches with whisky, water and
pannikin mustered in the best positions.
The first nip was a big one; There were
many others afterward. Slasher’s last dis-
tinct memory was a sweet, dreamy contem-
plation of money rolling in merrily, and
“Hello ! This door is unlocked"!”
The sharp tone, with no meaning, pene-
trated to Slasher’s brain, awakening nim
from the tail-end of a drunken sleep. Even
as he • yawned and commenced to slowly
stretch himself, the back door was thrown
open; then came a few quick steps and a
man, wearing a gauze mask, peered through
the doorway.
“What are you doing in here?” he de-
manded.;
. Slasher’s wits rose instantly to the occa-
sion ; they must not mistake him for a
burglar.
“Got shickered, I think : felt m’self goin’;
found th’ door unlocked an’ crawled in here
to sleep it off.”
The man’s eyes had already taken in
e-ough of the details to assure- him that
this was really the case. “Well,” lie said,
“your luck was particularly stiff. You must
have killed a Chinaman somewhere in your
travels. You’ll have to come out of it now,
and go into quarantine. We'te going to clean
up the place.”
Slasher had been stretched out, piteously,
to give full effect to his story; but he
seemed to rise to a standing position, in the
middle of the floor, in one all-embracing-
movement.
“Quarantine! Wliat for?”
“Chinaman died of bubonic plague in this
room yesterday morning. Found him dead
right on the bed you’ve been sleeping on.”
Frightened into a sudden, ghastly sobriety,
Dean began to fairly gibber with horror.
Then he leaped wildly for the open air in
full panic. But the fumigation gang downed
him neatly, and kept him flat until he was
flabby and docile in another reaction of
fright. He was then led away for treat-
ment and observation. His condition laid
him open for anything to take hold of him
and work its will. He was the most
demoralised thing ever seen north of Capri-
corn. Nevertheless he was totally free of
infection when his period of detention ended.
Among old associates his wild clamors
were so effective that he raised the price
of a third-class fare to Gladstone in time to
get aboard the first vessel going south.
As the boat steamed away from the jetty
wharf Slasher waved his fist. The sweep
of his _ arm embraced all Townsville in an
impartiality which scorned to pick and
choose. ,
“No more for mine! When you gotta
yellow devil like that Chow on ver track,
if you got the brains of a flea yoti'll let ’im
have the whole North on his own!”
