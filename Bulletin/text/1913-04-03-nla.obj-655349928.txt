The new “Prince of Poets,” elected by the
poets of Paris to succeed the late Leon Dierx,
is Paul Fort. The new prince is still a
young man, and the first of their own gen-
eration the symbolists have thus honored.
His election, however, is said to be less on
account of his own work than for his efforts
on behalf of poetry generally and for the
aid he has given to the new dramatic move-
ment. His verses are said to be “perhaps
the closest approach to popular poetry, in
the best sense, that is being written any-
where in the world to-day.” This sample of
his verse may be requoted from Contem-
porary French Poetry, reviewed last year
on this page :
The devil's ruby eyes peer all night long.
A-hunting mice to spit upon his little prong.
He kills three hundred thousand in his wrath,
And throws them in the village pond, and
lights his prong, and stirs the broth,
Which he will make those lovers swallow,
who
Think kissing and caressing is the only thing
they have to do.
And when they vomit on the pond their
hearts, he stirs
The gravy with his little fork, and turns the
hearts to porringers,
And hangs them on his long, green tail
To make a din, a din all night long in the
gale.
In The Victorian Age in Literature, in the
useful “Home University Library” (Wil-
liams and Norgate). there is a good deal of
Chesterton, and, incidentallv, some hints of
both literature and the Victorian Age. Even
the editors “wish to explain that this book
is not put forward as an authoritative his-
tory of Victorian literature. It is a free
and personal statement of views and im-
pressions about the significance of Victorian
literature made by Mr. Chesterton at
the editors’ express invitation.” Ches-
terton adds, “It is a task for which I feel
myself wholly incompetent,” but reassures
us with the statement that he felt the same
sense of incompetency in every one of his
other literary enterprises. The reader whose
appetite demands something solid is referred
elsewhere ; but the diner-out who can make
a meal of stewed epigrams, iced alliteration
and paradoxes on toast will find here fare
that, if light, is tasty.
John Ivelman writes interestingly in
Among Famous Books (Hodder and Stough-
ton, per Angus and Robertson, Svdney)
upon literature ranging from Marius the
Epicurean, through Pepyls Diary, to Ches-
terton and The Hound of Heaven Careful
arid somewhat crusted criticism.
The original of Dickens’ Fagin apparently
died in Tasmania, but whether he left any
good Australians as descendants is not
known. The New Bookman calls to
mind that Fagin was founded on a notorious
“fence,” or receiver of stolen goods, pos-
sessed of the good old English name of Ikey
Solomons. In his teens he was sent to the
hulks at Chatham, but on his release he
managed to save enough from two years’
honest toil to set up in London as a fence,
with provincial agencies for the disposal of
his trade. Sometimes he had as much as
£20,000 worth of stolen articles secreted at
his head office. Exposure came, and Ikey
decided to emigrate to N.S.W., but was
arrested. He escaped from gaol, and got to
America, _ where he built up a flourishing
business in the circulation of forged notes.
His wife, left in London, continued the old
business, and received a sentence of 14 years’
transportation to Van Diemen’s Land. Solo-
mons joined her there, and “they set up a
general shop, and began to prosper.” But
he was recognised, taken back to England,
tried, and received the same sentence as his
wife, and at his own request was brought
back to Tasmania.

Verses by Arthur H. Adams
THE PLEIADES.
Last night l saw the Pleiades again,
Faint as a drift of steam
From some tall chimney-stack ;
And I remembered you as you were then:
Awoke dead worlds of dream,
And Time turned slowly back.
/ saw the Pleiades through branches bare,
And close to mine your face
Soft glowing in the dark;
For youth and Hope and Love and You
were there
At our dear trysting-place
In that bleak London park.
And as we kissed the Pleiades looked down
I' rom their immeasurable
Aloofness in cold Space.
Do you remember how a lust leaf brown
Between us flickering fell
Soft on .your upturned face?
Last night I saw the Pleiades again,
Here in the alien South.
Where no leaves fade at all;
And I remembered you as you were then,
And felt upon my mouth
Your leaf-like kisses fall!
The Pleiades remember and look down
On me made old by grief,
Who then a young god stood ,
When you—now lost and trampled by the
Town.
A lone wind-driven leaf —
Were young and sweet and good!
MARS.
Two lovers strolled beneath the spacious
night;
And in the silver phalanx overhead
Glowed sombrely one sullen spear-point red —
Menacing Mars amid that host of white!
But only in each others’ eyes made bright
By many dreams the lovers looked, nor read
The meaning of that bronzen portent dread:
What need have lovers’ eyes for other light?
And yet in that enormous world of Mars
Two lovers once had dreamed as now they
dreamed, ' ,
And died, and left of all their tears no trace,
Save a dead globe by fissures strangely
seamed —-
A tomb whereon they wrote, for unborn stars.
Those few faint pencilled lines that chal-
lenge Space!
The Unborn.
I dwell a temple-dusk within;
I still the tremors of my heart;
The world with all its haste and din
Swims by, remote and slow and dim.
I am a vessel placed apart ,
1 Vith the rich wine of life a-brim.'
Greatly serene, with even breath
I live aloof , my yearnings dumb.
I have grown strange to life and death.
My husband has gone far from me;
And all my body has become
A mute and hushed expectancy.
And lie—the man-child I shall bear —
He must be strong; so I am strong.
(This arrogant soul that I prepare!)
My iveakness every hour I slay.
He shall be pure and hate the wrong;
So I —thisuntamed claw-thing—pray!
In twilit peace I brood and wait.
I have put from me griefs and fears;
I have forgotten what is hate;
And love too fierce a flame may be.
Only sometimes the uncalled tears
Flood all the courage out of me.
My anger in a leash T take;
For I have died, and now am part
Of this Sweet blossom soon to wake.
With drugging faith my thoughts I
drown;
And in my unrepentant heart
This night I crush the rebel down!
My passions are like breezes spent
That on the twilight’s bosom die;
And I am still and reverent.
And yet the task! Ah, God. how can
This broken, melting meekness, I.
Bring forth the splendor of a Man?
From “The Collected Verses of Arthur II.
Adams”
(Whiteomhe and Tombs).
Adams and Verse
Skilful is the word for Arthur H. Adams,
lor neatness and despatch he is a sort of
Australian Arnold Bennett; one of those
who do many things, while the other fellow
is still thinking. The other fellow’s thought
may be fruitful or barren. Whatever its
quality, when turned into print, it will not
compare in quantity with the output of a
Bennett or an Adams. Bennett has pub-
BShed more. Yes, but when an Australian
of 40 has managed to get eight books printed
and others written, besides much for the
newspapers and magazines, the quantity of
his work may be regarded as corresponding
to two or three times the amount by one
who is close to English facilities.
Here in The Collected Verses of Arthur
H. Adams (Whitcombe and Tombs, Melb.;
55.) we have a ‘‘definite and final” selection
from the author’s poems, with the exception
of The Nazarene and London Streets. Those
volumes, we are told, could not well be
represented in extract.
passing the forewords, we begin.with some
Maori Legends.” How much is legend and
how much Adams is a fine point. I should
guess that he gets nearest to a Maori atmo-
sphere in two rhymed poems “The Strang-
ling Cord” and “The Path of Souls.” How-
ever that may be. “The Path of Souls” shows
the technician, by the way in which it gets
the monotony of a march of the dead (per-
haps a little too rapid) ; and it gives more
than technique:—
Silent, without a breath or moan,
Yet knowing 1 am not alone,
/, in my place in that long line,
Shall find, perchance, some human sign,
Shall see the lightly trodden grass
Where all unseen thi shadows pass
Their way to lone Te Reinga.
And in the ranks of marching dead
The narrow, twilight path l tread,
And see where half-remembering lingers
Some spirit lone, with futile fingers,
Tying a knot of waving grass
To show the way that l must pass
To night and dark Te Reinga.
And I, in turn, shall pause and clutch
The living grass with lingering touch,
And leave the message of a knot
That I may not be all forgot
By those who, desolate and dumb.
Must come the road that I have come
To Life's Last Door, Te Reinga.
“Marama: The Moon-God” is a sort of
cousin to Apollo the Sun God, as that deity
is seen in Stephen Phillips’s “Marpessa.”
There is a stronger ending in Adams’s ‘‘South
Sea Legend,” but I think that brave old man,
Tangata, would have been more at home in
a form almost crude, instead of this melli-
fluous modern blank verse. Adams makes it
very well, though :
She listened for his coming at the pool
Filled with old dreams, brimming ivith mem-
ories
Of words most wondrous, and of silences
More wonderful. Lo, how the palms above
Retold the murmur of their long farewell!
For ‘‘Puhihuia” we have a simpler ?tyle,
chronicler taking precedence of poet:—
So on the beach
Mhile Pong a ivith his mat over his head
Sat blinded that he should not see her slain,
Raked and singly, Puhihuia fought
Three women of her tribe, and slew the three.
So, satisfied by this blood-payment made,
Tier mother and her people went in peace.
And Puhihuia with her lover lived
And-made his tribe her own, until one day —-
(To be continued in book.) The “Maori
Legends” are followed by shorter poems
arranged under various headings. Some of
these have been selected and revised from
Maoriland, that promising first book now
14 years old. Adams has learnt a lot since
the day of Maoriland; in ease and finish he
has passed many milestones; but there’s a
young sincerity in things like “The Dwel-
lings of Our Dead,” for which one would
give much of his later cynicism. Though
usually kept for prose, the cynical quality
appears occasionally in his. verse, as in A
Foreword: For the Critics” and “The Ballad
of Judgment Day.”
Really, you know, one oughtn’t to review
a verse-book when it’s new, or largely new.
It needs living with for complete judgment.
But I’ve carried the Adams book in a pocket
for some days (though it’s more than
“pocket” size), and have found it bear the
test of changing moods. I like the imagina-
tion in these lines from “Night in England” :
And over all dead England, from dark
towers,
T illage to village calling, chime to chime,
The empty churches tell the empty hours.
And the fancy in the termination of a “Per-
sonal” sonnet: —
This craven heart that ivith a Judas-hiss
Rightly betrays me to the swords of Doubt!
Fancy is the Adams quality rather than
imagination. Sometimes we have a linking
of both
High in air
The street-lamps of a greater city flare,
But of its tireless traffic not a sound!
Those three quotations are from the son-
nets. Australia has some good things to its
credit in this form, and Adams gives us some
more. If someone were to make an Aus-
tralian sonnet anthology (a pleasant task),
it should certainly include "Nemesis” and
Alars. This last is one of half a dozen
Star Sonnets,” of uneven quality as they
are of varying date. The young word-
seeker, for instance, dragged “spilth” and
largesse into “Life.” “Nemesis” reminds
one in its idea of Shelley’s “Ozymandias”
and the lines in Wilde’s “Sphinx” about
many a bearded Bedouin”; but the theme
that all things must fade is as free to poets
now as it has ever been, and desert ruin is
a natural illustration.
The “Lyrics” are not lyrical in the sense,
for example, of Jean Inglelow’s “One Morn-
ing, or Christina Rossetti’s “A Birthday”-
they seldom sing themselves to you. They
are meditative rather :
Last night I saw the Pleiades again,
Faint as a drift of steam
From some tall chimney stack;
And I remembered you as you were then:
Awoke dead worlds of dream,
And Time turned slowly back.
The drift of steam from some tall chimney
stack ’ seems to justify itself against Poe’s
pronouncement that artificial objects may be
compared to natural, but not natural to arti-
ficial: a chandelier to an ice-hung tree, but
not the tree to a chandelier. But whether
confetti may fairly flutter through these
lines is a more doubtful point:—
I stood beneath the Night’s unmoved ex-
panse.
And, lo! upon the fallow darkness sown
Like seeds, the starsj or bright confetti
thrown
Upon the dusty floor of circumstance.
Anyway, men will try these experiments,
whatever other men say. An objection, here
as in parts of tlmt good book, London Streets,
is that such imagery is too clever to be
poetry. A fault in a good deal of Adams’s
.prose and verse is to put cleverness before
all.
"Interrogations,” the section that ends
the book, contains a number of good things,
with others of less merit. “The Coliseum,”
“The Jew,” and “Funeral March” may be
specially named for quality. A few lines
from “The Coliseum” :
And I was but the grave of unquiet ghosts
That moaned and wondered, twitched and
stirred and fought,
And maimed and murdered endlessly . This
soul
Was but the desolated battleground
For issues undecided, ancient feuds
Begotten in the ape, revenges vowed
Before my earliest self strangely erect
Stood balancing uncouthly,..,
W 7 hat fierce vendettas cunningly bequeathed
Down the long generations snarling
went!....
Sometimes defeats, despairs unmitigable —
But never silence, nightfall. .. .never death!
A book worth having. Adams seems with
this to bid farewell to verse, but I don’t
know why he should. He has certainly
learned how to use the tools of the craft.
NORMAN LILLEY.
Art for Beer’s Sake
The question is, when “Bellerivn”
down to wnte “The Assassin's Dream" fn
“Answers to Correspondents,” 13/a/T-n .
A stern and silent warder ' °
His moody watch did keep
O’er a grim and death-doomed convict
Who muttered in his sleep.. ltct
did he do the fell deed for Art’s WkV ~ (
Morality’s sake, or for Life’s S afc 0r i 01 '
distinction is vital, as Arthur Ron/ 16
points out in his essay, “Art for Life\
in his new volume of Portraits and Kneel
irons (Macmillan, per Dymock’s l£z
Sydney) Does “The Assassin’s Dream”’
teach us to order our lives? lias it n m 1
Will we be the better on arii"/,?” 1 ’
perusal of that grim piece of pathos’ Win
* strengthen Ais on our path past the pub
of Life? Or has morality nothing to do with
beauty A work, of art that declares its
sympathy with one or other party is nn
whose creator has looked aside to ends other
than beauty.” Can the art of “Bellerive*
be limited to edifying subjects? Is it his
job, intent on the creation of a work of pure
art, to exalt either assassin or warder’ Both
are subjects of equal value to an artist's
eyes. Both are material for his pen Art is
independent of morality. But, wait isn’t
there a third alternative? Art for Morality’s
sake. Art for Art’s sake... .what about Art
for Life s sake?
“When a man tells you that his work has
nothing to do with morality, ask hjm: With
whose morality has it nothing to do? He
will be compelled to admit that the morality
of which he is thinking is the morality he
attributes to somebody e15e....N0 artist no
human being, escapes morality, and the code
of values that is hD will be one of the de-
termining influences on an artist’s vision of
life. If, perchance, he is so uncritical as to
believe that he has nothing to do with
morality, that belief will itself share in giv-
ing his work a moral value. . There is no
escape from morality in art A work of
art is always the expression of a morality,
the morality of its creator at the moment
when he began its creation, a morality that
has ceased to exist, since its creator has been
changed to a greater or less degree by the
very fact of creation.”
Therefore the reader of “The Assassin’s
Dream ” who unconsciously tries to share
the moment of conscious life that was “Belle-
rive’s,” does, in contemplation of this work
of art, share to some extent in the momen-
tary morality of another man.
Let us investigate the third alternative,
Art for Life’s sake. “That man is the great-
est artist who makes us most profoundly
conscious of life.” Is “The Assassin’s
Dream” “a piece of conscious life, separated
watchfully from the flux of living, a piece of
knowing carried out by the artist, which
we are allowed to share? Does it give us
a new possession by making us aware of
something w T e possess? We do not ask an
artist for opinions, for facts, for skill alone.
We have the right to ask for more. We ask
him for ourselves; we ask him for life.”
Unfortunately Arthur Ransome has
stopped just there, culpably missing the
implication of his theory. Art for Life’s
sake....what is that but Art for Beer’s
sake? Under this beneficent banner all the
poetry of Australia is produced. No Wow-
ser ever wrote a poem. Does “The Assas-
sin’s Dream” give us a new' possession by
making us aw T are of something we possess?
Immediately. The new possession is the
knowledge that we are dry and that a pater-
nal Providence had long foreseen the coming
of The Bulletin office to George-street,
and planted three perfect pubs almost within
arm’s reach. We do not ask “Bellerive” for
opinions, for facts, for skill alone —though he
has got all three; we ask him for life, we
ask him for beer. And, cheerfully, abun-
dantly, without scruple or niggardly pint
measure, he gives it. After “Bellerive,” as
after beer, we feel alive.
The Swedish feministe, Ellen Key, has
said all she has to say about women in her
Love and Marriage and The Century of the
Child. The Woman Movement , despite its
preface by Havelock Ellis (Putnam, per
Dymock’s Library. Sydney), is a dull survey
of the question, anparently wwitten to order;
and Love and Ethics (Putnam), a slight
shilling’s-worth, is vague and prosy.
Stacy Waddy, headmaster of the Kings
School, Parramatta, writes, in The Great
Moghul (Constable, per Angus and Robert-
son) a delightful book for boys. Incidents
in the adventurous story of the history or
Akbar are pleasantly detailed; and the style
is just the style that boys like.
Local publications include Life of a Coun-
try Teacher, by “Junius” (Page and Bird.
Melb.), an indictment of Australian depart-
mental treatment of State school teachers,
the importance of which lies, if it lies any-
where at all, in the alleged facts stated, and
not in the manner of stating them ; and >1 oie
to Become a Ventriloquist, by the Aus-
tralian ventriloquist Richard
(Frazer and Jenkinson, Melb.). H a “-
reader of this page desires to become a ven-
triloquist, there will be nothing on earth
in the police regulations to stop him an
reading this w r ork.

ELECTRIC LIGHT PLANT
(Lister-Brustoiv System—Patented).
This plant generates electricity automatically, and does away with large and
expensive storage battery. Can be started from drawing-room or bedroom.
With the exception of keeping the plant clean, lubricating and filling the
tanks, no attention is required.
Upon switching on the lights the plant works, and when the lights are turned
off the plant stops automatically.
The set is self-contained, and is delivered ready to work.. No erection or
foundations necessary; all one has to do is to connect to the wires to the house,
shop, hall, hotel, or town lights, and fill up the tanks with oil. It is exceptionally
cheap as regards lighting costs, the user being able to enjoy all the many advantages
of electric light, at a rate per candle power cheaper than most systems of petrol
gas, acetylene, and other artificial lights, and have current always ready for lights,
fans, cooking, pumps, saws, separators, milking and chaffcutting, sewing and other
machines.
Is absolutely safe and reliable; no smell or fumes, dirt or smoke.

The
Kodak
Girl.
A FEW people in Melbourne —including H.
H. Champion, who ought to know better —
are blowing on the embers of the Andersen
case, which was fully discussed in The
Bulletin some years ago. This is the story.
Peter Andersen, having developed delu-
sions concerning his wife, was undoubtedly
a dangerous lunatic as far as she was con-
cerned. For her sake and his own, he was
put away for a few weeks on the certificate
of two doctors, who knew the facts. Except
for his crazy notion that his plain, homely,
long-suffering, careworn wife was a flighty,
fresh, enchanting creature who had mis-
conducted herself with a large assortment
of male citizens, from Acting-Governor
Madden dowffwards, poor Peter Andersen
could pass for a quite sane person. Being,
moreover, an artfully unconscious liar, he
presently persuaded two other doctors to
swear to his sanity. The fact was that his tale
convinced everybody who talked with him,
but had not seen his wife, or obtained full
information about the unfortunate matron;
and these other doctors did not see his wife,
or know how different she was to the syren
of Andersen’s wild dreams. The man soon
got his release from the asylum, and then
brought a divorce suit against the missus.
Of course, he was nonsuited as soon as his
monomania was made apparent to the Court.
After that, he spent some years (during
which time The Bulletin met him and
analysed his grievance) in trying to get his
certificate of lunacy cancelled, although his
delusions re his wife remained as strong as
ever. Recently (the lady having meantime
left him) he was re-committed to an asy-
lum once again, and was again released (on
parole) ; whereupon he went around pro-
claiming his sanity, and imposing upon un-
informed people, with the result that a num-
ber of indignation-mongers held a meeting
at Melb. Town Hall. The meeting proposed
a deputation to the Chief Secretary to pro-
test against the “injustice.” But John
Murray, who is much too tired to be seri-
ously unkind, refused to receive it, saying
that he had gone exhaustively into the_ca.se,
and “could assure the public that no injus-
tice is being done.” The Bulletin rarely
suspects John Murray of going exhaus-
tively into anything, but it gives him credit
for having probed the shallow Andersen
case to its bedrock. No injustice is being
done to Andersen. On the other hand, any
number of libellous insinuations, direct or
otherwise, are being cast at the poor man’s
wife, and the numerous personages and per-
sons whopi the poor man accused of philan-
dering with her, and the doctors who have
at one time or other certified to the poor
man’s insanity. If the Andersen case were
really worth worrying over, the present
worriers would be in danger of the ven-
geance of that very Law and Justice they
talk so much about. But, as it isn’t worth
worrying over, the best and most judicial
thing they can do is to shut up.
♦
Sydney’s most uncompromising press bat-
tler for Fat, the Daily Telegraph, fell
over a heap of its own ignorance the other
day. Minister for Labor Carmichael, hav-
ing announced that he proposed to represent
the public interest before the Gas Em-
I ployees’ Wages Board, was roundly con-
demned by the outraged publication, which
demanded to be told —
Who gave Mr. Carmichael the right to send i
Government official, or appoint some barrister to re
present them (gas consumers), or, for that ’matter
to come along and represent them himself’ \y a «
that the purpose for which he was returned to Par
liament ?. . . . The point is that he has assumed an
authority he was never expressly or impliedly given
Next day Carmichael poured section 30
of the Arbitration Act into the editorial
vacuum. It reads as follows:
The Crown may, where, in the opinion of the Min-
ister, the public interests are or would be likely to
be affected, intervene in any proceedings under this
part before a Board or the Court, or appeal from an
award of a Board and make such representations as it
thinks necessary in order to safeguard the public in-
terests.
But, apart from the Arbitration Act alto-
gether, “every solicitor’s clerk,” as Car-
michael sneered, knows that the Crown,
by the fundamental principles of common
law, has the right to intervene where the
public’s interests are endangered. And con-
sidering that the public is threatened by the
gas cos. with a turn of the screw, it was
clearly up to somebody to put in an appear-
ance on behalf of the consumers. The
Telegraph didn’t think so —-which shows
that it is consistent, anyhow.
Adelaide is hearing another call to the
empty North. The noise takes the novel
shape of various bundles of native grasses.
Cut from rough land beyond Oodnadatta
three or four weeks after the big February
rain, they show in''almost every instance a
steady growth of an inch a day.
A touching narrative -was unwound by
Mrs. Hughes, of the Women’s Fashionable
League, in the Argus the other day. (If
you have tears, prepare to shed them now) :
A bed-ridden woman has found a way [of aiding
“Liberalism”] though stricken with paralysis for
years. She asked that anyone who was in ignorance
of the political situation or the meaning of the Refer-
endum, should come to see her, and at her bedside
they learn. She is often weary when evening comes,
and she has had many callers, but she is happy, for
she feels —physically helpless as she is—she has done
something for God and country.
It must be very comforting for “Liberalism”
to knew for certain that the Almighty is on
the right side.
Justice Cussen, who goes in danger of
being jabbed to death with hatpins since lie
decided in favor of unequal pay for
equal clerical work, threw out a sig-
nificant hint last week re the incar-
cerated Chia. He was asked to grant
bail to the shut-up Chinaman, on the ground
that he ought to be at liberty to “prepare
his defence.” Now, a mere European
charged with attempt to murder anybody is
supposed for a time to be a danger to every-
body, and is kept in prison accordingly. But
Judge Cussen, although he refused the first
application for bail, spoke of this prisoner
as being merely dangerous to another pei-
son,” and practically advised his counsel to
“suggest some way by which Chia could be
released, and (say) report himself at some
place far away from the other person at
stated times.” It sounds as though Justice
Cussen might be prepared to consider a
further request for Cilia’s release, provided
that someone will show his Honor that ( the
prisoner is ready to go to Hongkong to pre-
pare his defence.”

Dear Sirs, —It is now

your Air Gas Machine was
installed in my residence.
Its efficiency has exceeded
all expectations; for light,
economy, cleanliness, as well
as for cooking purposes, it is
the best that I know of. My
20-Light Machine provides
sufficient light for all pur-
poses, in addition to supply-
ing gas for the stove. To be
able to do all cooking by gas
in a country home at a
moderate cost is a con-
venience that must appeal to
anyone making a gas instal-
lation, especially when do-
mestic help is at such a
premium. Wishing you all
the success that your machine
merits.—l am, yours faith-
fully, (Sgd.) F. 0. WAKE.

Perfect sanitation being so necessary for health, disinfection
is imperative. Make a practice of using IZAL every day-
just a little, diluted with water —pouring it down drains,
sinks and w.c.’s, and sprinkling it in dustbins or other
harbours of filth. Get IZAL, because it positively kills disease
germs, stops infection and instantly removes bad smells.
IZAL— the guaranteed disinfectant of unrivalled
Strength—is the pioneer modern high power germicide.

FLAT-CHESTED WOMEN!
Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural de-
velopment was concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your
life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be
fully developed and your weight increased to normal.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightful fulness of the
feminine form that captivates, and the woman who is most
perfectly developed is the one who monopolises the endear-
ments of the opposite sex.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect, flesh-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week. Send 2d.

Questions.
In the elemental vastness of the prehistoric
world,
\\ ere our fragmentary beings most chaoti-
cally hurled?
Were the primal atoms scattered through the
dark detours of Space,
Till beneath the tailor’s cunningness they
found a hiding place?
And were the flying formulae abominably
mixed,
Ere in sexual proportions they were per-
manently fixed?
Were the parts that were intended to be
corporate of Me
Disproportionately blended in the cosmic
mixery?
Were the premature components of the
primal Him and Her
Transpositionally guilty for my current char-
acter?
Was the goodness misdirected—did the Truth
become the Taint,
So that I absorbed the vices—and the sin-
ner is the saint?
Did the Wowser atoms settle in the mould
that shapes the “sport”?
Did the Chadbands and Madonnas in the
mystic maze consort?
The philanthropist and usurer—is each a
part of each?—
Oh! the tangle, God of Tangles, pray un-
ravel, I beseech !
And when my great uprightness at the sin-
ner’s border halts,
Are what people term my virtues but an-
other fellow’s faults?
Am I such a general mix-up of the genuine
and sham,
That I’m mostly what I am not—and I am
not what I am?
Was the mix-up but the plaything of a weird,
disordered, chance?
Would another stack and shuffle change the
Final Circumstance?
Would a halo now be resting on my mer-
cenary head —-
Or a crown of thorns adorn it, or the hang-
man’s hemnen thread?
Would I naturally perpetrate another brand
of life?
Would I be a henpecked husband or a suf-
fragetic wife?
Would I wind the cat just after tea, heave
out the clock at ten,
Or bring the lobster gaily home at —God
alone knows when?
Would I be this, or you be that? But —
well, I’m what I am,
And what I might have been, or you, it
matters not a damn !
We were moved and mixed and muddled, we
were gathered from afar—
And I reckon we are lucky to be even what
we are!

Heaven and Hell.
This was Heaven on earth to me :
An emerald valley, a primrose sky.
And the breeze in the red gums lilting by,
Soughing reed-bed and sighing tree.
A river gleaming its way between
The far-flung gold of the seeding grass,
The hazy sunbeams that dance and pass,
And the crimson fading to tourmaline.
This was Heaven on earth to me :
Purple Twilight and evening star.
The last pink flush on the range afar,
And the fair white Angel of Used-to-be.
This to me is an earthly Hell:
A primrose sky and a valley green ;
And, under the red gum’s whispering
screen,
The sighing story the night winds tell.
The gleam of the river murmuring aye
Throusrh the fluttering maze of the grasses
fold; . .
The sunbeams fading in dusty gold,
And the crimson fading to dusky grey.
This is Hell upon earth to me:
Evening star and the sunset fires.
The last pink flush in the far hills’ spires,
And the lonely Demon of Memory.

COMMER LORRY—3-TON CAPACITY .
“COMMER” Motor Lorries
Capacity : 1 Ton to 7 Tons.
Time was when the “Commer” Motor Lorry 7 was an “innovation.” Time
was when a few enterprising commercial “experimentalists” each installed a
“Commer,” and the balance of the business-world watched the new depar-
ture with interest.
Time passed—and established the fact that what had looked like a daring
and costly experiment had proved the finest form of business economy. The
“Commer” —that was an “innovation” —has become
An Absolute Business Necessity.
By increasing the radius of your business the “Commer” adds to your list
of customers. Its speed and capacity mean that you can reach and handle
business that formerly might have needed the establishment of a local branch.
The “Commer” Lorry deserves the earliest and fullest investigation by
the merchant or the carrier. It means the expediting of business, the con-
venience of the owner, and the satisfaction of the customer.
Carrying capacity, 1 ton to 7 tons. Engine, 4 cylinders, cast in pairs;
Bosch high tension magneto ; gear driven, also coil and accumulator ; chain
drive with chain cases; automatic lubrication; efficient radiator; three, four
and five speeds forward and one reverse ; direct drive on top gears always
in mesh with dog clutch drive ; foot brake on driver between gear box and
differential, operated by pedal on foot board ; side hand brakes, operated on
drum of rear wheels ; internal expanding positively taken on and off (on
larger models a special spring buffer drive is fitted between differential and
gear box, the latter being of the “fool-proof” type) ; complete set of tools,
ball bearings throughout.
Any Type of Body Fitted.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin/' is
the proper superscription for “copy." Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there ; the official always is.

THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 1913.
IS AUSTRALIA FIT TO BE TRUSTED?
You can generally judge a case by the argu-
ments with which it is supported. If their
feebleness is so palpable that they dodder
unashamedly, it may be taken as read that
the case dodders likewise. The agitation
against the Constitutional amendments
aimed at in the approaching Referenda was
begun three years ago by a hysterical fore-
shadowing of the weird calamities that
might afflict the Commonwealth if the elec-
tors voted “Yes.” The people were assured
that if this thing happened, almost any old
tragedy might occur. Honest and toilsome
William Blighter, steering his bottle wag-
gon day by day. might have the vehicle
peremptorily “nationalised.” That is to
say, if the Australian Government was suffi-
ciently demented it might commandeer Wil-
liam’s conveyance, his horse, harness and
bottles, and hand the same to a State official,
leaving the rightful owner to starve, or
drink himself to death, or abandon the coun-
try for ever, or burst. It was pointed out,
with the crude emphasis which is observable
in bellowdrama actors, revivalists and cheap
politicians, that these sensational troubles
would be liable to fall upon all, “rich and
poor alike.” The affluent station-owner was
represented as standing in the same hideous
financial peril as the thrifty widow-woman
who had hoarded up a few sovereigns against
the cold blasts of old age. It was urged that
shopkeepers of stainless probity might sud-
denly find themselves dispossessed of their
businesses, and flung more or less insolvent
on a ravening world. Also, the same or
worse might happen to indent-agents, her-
balists, proprietors of fowl-runs, pub-keepers,
undertakers, importers and grocers of all
sorts and sizes. Peculiar stress was laid,
for some obscure reason or another, on the
potential embarrassments of fruit-barrow pro-
prietors. W. 11. Kelly. M.P., mentioned in
the Paddington Town Hall, amid such an
awed hush as one conceives preceding the
final assault upon Chatalja, that “if these
amendments were carried the Australian
Parliament would have power to nationalise
every fruit-barrow in the Commonwealth.”
(Profound sensation and murmurs of
“Shame.”) Certain speakers made a prac-
tice of collecting from a directory or similar
work a list of the whole of the nation’s
trades and professions, more or less, and
firing the portentous thing at their audi-
ences, with the menacing finale: “Vote ‘Yes’
and you give Parliament the power to seize
upon all these, and more.” It is depressing
for a paper, which, like Abou Ben Adhem,
loves its fellow man to a certain extent, to
have to admit that, so far as a large section
of the electors was concerned, these tactics
succeeded. On all sides were to be found
muddled citizens obsessed with a vague idea
that, unless a “No” answer was recorded,
everything would be “nationalised”— i.e.,
stolen from everybody—and none would be
safe from daylight robbery—none, that is,
except politicians. In fact, warfare by
means of idiotic prophecies and wild, mar-
row-freezing forecasts was such a brilliant
success in 1911 that it is being employed
energetically by the leaders of the anti-
Referenda cause in the present campaign.
Consider, for example, some of the tragic
humbug which Alfred Deakin thought
good enough for the members of the Sydney
Chamber of Commerce last week:—
Six grants of power you are asked to place in the
hands of your representatives, chosen to conduct the
business of this country for three years in the one
Chamber and for six years in the other —to take
that power from its reservoir where it now lies,
subject to your control, and. place it beyond your con-
trol, but irrevocably subject to their control. Five
of these proposals are unlimited in their scope, and
undefined. You are giving blank cheques. You
are asked to transfer five powers, unlimited and abso-
lutely undefined- —placing them in the hands of your
representatives in Parliament. They touch the
whole business of the community; thev affect the
whole production of the country; they influence
every man, woman and child in this community.
They touch their means of livelihood, they touch the
control of their businesses, they touch all transfer-
ence, whether by rail, sea or road, of goods from
any one part to any other. They touch the whole
range of these powers, placing them in the hands of
Parliament, which will handle the reins once they
have been released from your grasp, and placed under
their control. ( Applause.) The new powers to be
granted are tremendous.
There was about an acre more of this shrill
and frantic stuff. In fact, the address con-
sisted of practically nothing else. It seems
to have highly edified the commercial men.
Also, no doubt, it filled many of them with
that sort of pleasurable dismay which the
callow youth extracts from penny dreadfuls.
These clamorously reiterated warnings about
the vastness of the powers which Australia
is thinking of handing to its Parliament—
which is to say, to itself —carry weight only
with those who are so absorbed in the busi-
ness of amassing money or avoiding want
that they have no spare time to read or
think. Let it be supposed that the electors
were asked to hand not “five unlimited and
undefined powers” to their representatives
in Parliament, but 50. To what extent
would the national well-being be imperilled
if they did? Are our legislators malignant
lunatics insanely bent on reducing the coun-
try’s most cherished institutions to a state of
chaos, and avid to outrage the popular sense
of justice? Or are they plain, everyday
human beings vitally concerned to hold on
to their well-paid jobs—which is mainly a
matter of exasperating as few people as pos-
sible? The New Protection, Commonwealth
Control of Monopolies, a Federal rule—these
are reforms whose desirability is recognised,
if only in the abstract, by Conservatives and
democrats alike. Our soundest lawyers have
laid it down that, so far as these things are
concerned, in view of the High Court’s atti-
tude towards the Constitution, nothing less
than the powers asked for by the Govern-
ment is going to be effective. Assume that,
while certain powers are explicitly granted,
the Trade and Commerce clause is left un-
amended —and it is at the idea of any inter-
ference with this particular obstruction to
progress that the voice of Toryism grows
most deafening. The sole result must be
more legislation, more litigation; and after
the wasting of much time and an immensity
of Costs, the country will find itself where
it was five years or more ago. The alterna-
tive to so much profitless, not to say ruin-
ous, striving is for Australia to square its
jaw and trust, not a nation of unfriendly
niggers, not a nation of friendly whites, not
even a nation of oversea Britons —but it-
self. These tremendous powers in connec-
tion with which Alfred Deakin blithered
so strenuously last week, and which the whole
Liberal pack may be relied on to yap about
furiously during the next couple of months,
are not to be sent abroad. They are not to
be treated as a big section of Liberalism
wished to have our sea-power treated. They
are to stay in the country and be under the
country’s full control. Their abuse will
mean the political death of the guilty party.
The legislator who attempts to distort them
into an engine for nationalising fruit-bar-
rows or expropriating suburban grocers, will
inevitably conclude his career in a mad-
house. Alfred Deakin knows this. He
knows that the tendency of the modern party
politician is never to exceed his instructions,
so to speak. This class of individual does
too little rather than too much. Assure to
him a life of well-paid ease and he would be
charmed to do nothing at all. Every now
and then the weighty boot of public opinion
is Projected harshly against his person, and
under that stimulus he arises blaspheming
and does something—or tries to. Under
just such a goad Alfred Deakin passed the
Trade Marks Act. 1905, the Excise Tariff
Act. 1900 (known as “the New Protec-
tion”!. the Australian Industries Preserva-
tion Act, 1907, and other radical measures
which nothing but an affirmative answer in
the coming Referendum can validate.
It is significant that the best argument
which the intellectual chief of the local Tory
section can advance against a, set of pro-
posals framed with the object of effectuat-
ing his own legislation is that they confer
too much power on Parliament —a Parlia-
ment. by the way, which is elected
on about the most democratic basis on
earth. It is significant, because it
exposes—indeed, almost of itself proves
—the weakness of the anti-Referenda
case. It signifies, also, that Deakin’s esti-
mate of the collective intelligence of his audi-
ence is low. England has had all the powers
for many centuries which local Liberalism
fears to see in the hands of Australia to-
day. In England, and, later, in the United
Kingdom, those powers were wielded for a
very long time, not by the mass of the
people, but by a small and occasionally cor-
rupt section. It would be absurd to claim
that no harm resulted from that. But the
ultimate good immeasurably outweighed the
harm. The paramountcy of the central Par-
liament made possible a thousand swift re-
forms which less happily situated countries
went through untold agonies to achieve.
There comes a time in the life of every nation
when it outgrows its institutions. It needs
larger legislative clothes. If the means of
providing it with the necessary garments are
at hand, in the forms of an understanding
central Parliament and an unhampered Con-
stitution, there is peaceful change. In the
other event, there is bloody revolution or
such a state of affairs as exists in the Trust-
stricken States of America at the present
time. Every Australian who has read his-
tory intelligently appreciates that the Com-
monwealth is to-day in a situation which
may fairly be compared with that of, say,
Britain before the Reform Act of 1867.
There are changes, fiscal and industrial,
which the country must have; and it is the
feeblest variety of trash for prominent ooli-
ticians to contend that we should forego those
reforms for fear of what we may do to our-
selves if we are given the power to achieve
them.
INTERFERING WITH THE SWING
OF THE PENDULUM.
The ideas of men are always in a state of
flux, and the world never gets face to face
with an extreme proposition without imme-
diately retiring and trying to get a look at
the other end of the thing. Mankind, in the
mass, never willingly tries to take the middle
course, though in the nature of the mental
oscillation the pendulum spends as much of
its time in the middle as at the limits of its
swing. To push the analogy to its natural
conclusion is, of course, to say that the
world never really gets on air all, but is just
hanging like Mahomet’s coflin between the
top and bottom of nothing in particular.
Even that proposition might be fairly well
maintained by anybody who thought it
worth while ; for, on the evidence of the ages,
Thebes and Babylon were finer and larger
cities than London and New York, Greek art
was beyond our modern art, Roman admin-
istration in Britain jvas at least as good as
British administration is in India, and Phryne
by the seashore of At\ica was as dainty a
damsel as any Cissy?in the Bondi surf; and
probably, if we could dig him out of the
mists of time, som'elmdy told the intimate
bush workers’ tales of the drowned conti-
nent of Atlantis as well as Henry Lawson
has told those of Australia. All we can say
with certainty is that the pendulum swings,
and all that we can hope is that in its swing-
ing it sets some other works in motion w T hich
send the hands a trifle forward on the old
clock.
* * * *
But what is quite clear about this back-
ward and forward motion is that each end
of the swing represents a distinct idea or
group of ideas whose advocates, for lack of
a better term, we describe as a party.
Natural parties in politics and everything
else belong to the fixed order of things.
There must always be a crowd whose mind
swings to the end of the beat, and another
crowd which is filled with a desperate desire
to get back where it was before. There is
an illustration of this in the history of the
ancient Hebrew, before he got scattered
among the Gentiles and set up his con-
quering sign of the three balls. There was
always a prophetic party in Judah, which
went bald-headed and wild-whiskered for
change and reform, and a priestly party
which fought furiously against all change,
and, incidentally, conserved for the nation
all that the opposition crowd of the previous
generation had gained by hard and bitter
prophesying. The same sort of thing ap-
peared in a confused and confusing form
among the Greek statelets, was plain enough
in the history of Rome, broke out fiercely
in England in the 17th century, when Round-
head and Cavalier got after one another
with knives, was seen in the monarchical and
Republican struggle in France, and got its
most modern instance in the raging contro-
versy between North and South which shook
the United States to its last buckwheat cake
and brought doubtful joy to a large and
varied assortment of perspiring nigger. From
church councils to two-up schools, wherever
groups of men are associated together, there
will always be the natural cleavage of party
and the division between the backward and
forward thought, ever changing, ever re-
adjusting itself and keeping the old pendu-
lum to its moderately regular swing. The
bulk masses of human intelligence, and even
the mind of the individual, are nearly always
straining towards one extreme or the other.
An Erasmus or a Rosebery—the man who
sees both sides of every question too well to
have any real influence on his age—is almost
as rare a product in the world of affairs as
a Siiakspeare in literature; and the alleged
man of middle view is often merely the per-
son who won’t trouble to think about pro-
blems at all, but who goes as whim or oppor-
tunity dictates.

In primitive politics, or any matters where
mental forces and opinions meet on the bed-
rock of truth and plain dealing, natural
party cleavage is a good thing. It insures
that everything which is done shall have had
full consideration and argument, and that
the old pendulum in its outward swing shall
not fly off its balance altogether, and, aiming
at striking a star, merely smash a valuable
ornament and fall with a crash on the baby’s
head. Every question has two sides; and
natural party makes for slow% steady growth

which not only prevents men from bein?

prevents them from being honest with them
selves. The great charge to be laid at the
door of party politics as they exist among
us is that they destroy the reality of natural
party, and interfere with the useful and
regular swing of the pendulum.
* * *
The Australian parties of to-day stand for
compromise of thought and opinion, and no
section of the public has true or honest re-
presentation either in the State or Federal
sphere. As a result, great matters affecting
the whole of the future, to a degree which
the leaders of the various artificial groups
wholly fail to understand, are treated as if
they were trifles which could easily be set
aside until a more convenient season, while
matters of minor importance such as might
engage the attention of a parish council are
elevated to front rank and importance
Everything is gauged by its party signifi-
cance instead of its national claim. To keep
the party together, and by its influence hold
or gain office, is the be-all and end-all of the
game as it is played. Natural parties must
in the nature of things re-group themselves
upon the consideration of any new proposal;
but the fixed party system prevents this, and
in tying men down to the support of that
which is against their convictions, makes
Parliament an absurdity, and democratic
government a farce. Australia has big work
to do, and enormous problems to face. Its
first and chief requirement is a free mind
to take counsel of itself. This it cannot do
while the artificial ties of party bind its
intelligence and hold it from a fair expres-
sion of its own opinions and desires. In a
word, the Australian pendulum wants free
play that it may, if possible, get the hands
on the dial of progress a little forward, and
Party Government is the thing holding it
back.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The High Court.
i , Ar n ~ xt a n-

®"i M supphed t^% mo f t e ® e s lve commen
possible on Federal Attorney-General
Hughes’s action in appointing him to the
Hi S h Court Bench, by resigning the job and
returning to private practice. It is to be
a °P ed that Mr. Powers, whose appointment
was even more strikingly anomalous, will
s P eedd Y follow suit. The way will thus be
cleared for a couple of appointments that
wdl command the confidence of the commu-
nity - Ttie blizzard of scandalised protest
which succeeded W. M. Hughes’s bizarre
selections last month should satisfy the
Fisher Government that Australia will
stand nothing but the best in its chief
court - And there are other reasons why
the next appointments should be made with
extreme care. This week Chief Justice
Griffith leaves for England. He has
formally denied that there are any founda-
tions f° r the I’umor that he will not return
to Australia. Literally speaking, that is,
doubtless, correct. It may be assumed that
no one in authority has formally asked him
yet whether he would care for the billet of
Law Lord. But this is the position. Three
Lords of Appeal are to be chosen shortly
from .the “Oversea Dominions,” and it is
practically certain that Griffith will be
approached with an offer. The honor is a
great one, and, incidentally, the pay is good
and the j°b—unlike that of a High Court
Judge-carries a pension. The. London
climate, and the thought of breaking home
ties so lute in life, may, nevertheless, operate
to turn the Chief Justice’s steps to these
shores again. . Another powerful factor
would certainly be the consideration that he
was returning to occupy a Bench composed
°f men of a similar calibre to himself, more
or less, and holding, in consequence, a high
place in the public esteem. Few things are
more distasteful to a man of capacity than
daily association with incompetents or
weaklings. To expect Judges of the Gkif-
fith stamp to forego great opportunities
abroad, and hurry home to labor cheek-by-
jowl with the third-raters of this vast coun-
try- is equivalent to expecting that a grown
uian would willingly exchange most of his
ideas day by day with an indifferently in-
telligent scholboy. Australia has lost enough
big men already, as a result of the stupiditj
and shortsightedness of those in high places,
It can’t afford to sacrifice any more, in
particular, it can’t afford to run the itsk
of losing one of those rare and valuable
phenomena, a good Judge. Bearing that 1
mind, and other considerations apart, tn
Government should see to it that the nex
are intellectually worthy ot tn
men they will be called on to associate wit •
Adrian‘Knox and B. R. Wise, of N. »•
Wales; P. McM. Glynn; Mitchell, or
Victoria; Symon —all these have powertu
claims of different sorts. But _ whate
type the Government selects in its nuu
appointments—whether the man cho ,
happens to be a Torv and a non-pohtic •
such as Mitchell, K.C., or a democrat anu


one steeped in politics, like Wise—let him
at least be admittedly in the forefront of his
class. If that condition is fulfilled there
will be no serious kick coming from any
quarter.
The Logic of the First Wallop.
With the fall of Adrianople the last glini-
mer of Turkey’s hope goes out. I he mu-
garian, despite his frightful losses, has
trampled his hereditary enemy in the mud,

had a look in. Greece has fought splendid y,

the lesson thus learned to heart. The un-
ready people, has no hope of keeping its end
up or closing its broken ranks in the
breathing time between battles. If the
enemy succeeds in landing one effective blow
on the Australian jaw in the neighborhood
of Darwin, the idea of a final and successful
rally somewhere about the Macdonnell Range
is. as idle as the Turk’s hope of making a
triumphant and world-shaking sortie from
the lines at Chatalja. The thing must simply
be counted out of all reasonable possibility.
If Australia is not ready when the bell rings,
the towel may as well be thrown in at once,
and it is a very sanguine sort of person who
imagines that we are seriously getting ready.
This Commonwealth has, first of all, the
task of overcoming the enemy within its
gate by routing with the tremendous weapons
of logic and earnestness the effete and dan-
gerous “camel corps,” and insisting that a
straight railway shall be built with all speed
to the point of danger. Failing that, a pro-
vince larger, fairer and infinitely richer than
all the possessions the Turk ever held in
Europe goes to the alien, and the fault lies
with those of us who let ourselves be fooled
by the shallow words of people who wouldn’t,
and didn’t want to, understand the situation.
Doing the Things that Don’t Matter.
The excellent horse-doctor whom the Com-
monwealth, through its administrators,
selected on his veterinary qualifications to
run the finest province of Australia, is busy
hunting for a site for the capital of his
realm. Darwin won’t do, mainly because it
is at times uncomfortably warm there, and
the mosquito sings with something more than
his wonted venom to the sparse and mostly-
Chinese population of the village. The Ter-
ritory is making quite a collection of per-
sonages and things. It has an Excellency, a
geologist, an experimental farm, and a
Director of Secondary Education, and now
it is to have a new capital of its own. There
is something in the nature of comic opera
about the whole futile business. The reason
South Australia did not succeed in develop-
ing the Territory is well known to every
politician in Australia. The State was quite
sincere in most of its efforts, and had quite
sound notions about the nature of the job
it had in hand, but it failed to push things
to a successful conclusion because it lacked
the wherewithal to complete its transconti-
nental railway. The great advantage which
the Commonwealth, as a whole, possesses
over the State, which at least tried hard and
accomplished something, is that it can build
the railway it has undertaken to build. This
is the first and absolutely necessary. thing.
Without it all the rest is futile. A Director
of Secondary Education at the present
moment will do less to develop the North
than the man who lays a dozen sleepers or
screws up a fish-plate, and a gang of navvies
toiling in the region beyond Oodnadatta is a
matter of infinitely more importance than
the selection of a capital, site. Still, the
business of building a capital looks showy,
and, possibly, if a Governor-General can be
got to lay a foundation-stone, or something,
the people may be blinded to the. bitter truth
that the politicians now holding Federal
office are shirking their duty of pushing on
with the railway which can alone make the
development of the Territory a reality.. First
things ought to come first, but the idea of
Fisher and his crowd appears to be to do
the 17th thing first, and then tackle the 45th
with great earnestness.
Alfred Deakin and the Referendum.
Alfred Deakin, ex-leader of the Common-
wealth Opposition, addressed the Sydney
Chamber of Commerce after a lunch last
week: and when the turkey got in the truth
got out—part of the truth, anyway. .Of
course, Mr. Deakin’s remarks were mainly
about the coming Referenda: —
Six grants of power you are asked to place in
the hands of your representatives, chosen to conduct
the business of the. country for three years in one
Chamber and for six years in the other—to take
that power from its reservoir where it now lies
subiect to your control, and place it beyond your
control, but irrevocably subject to their control.
.Power was sought over every living being
in the community, absolute, unlimited, inexplicable
and indefinable. .. .You are asked to give despotic
authority over the whole of Australia to a limit
number of men.
Deakin knows how the Liberal party s
selected and elected, and he apparently,
the light of that knowledge, regards the Par-
liament as no longer representative of the
people or responsible to the people. Had
he remained in politics, at the first swing of
the pendulum he would have become Prime
Minister, and, knowing himself and his
bartv he seems to admit that neither he nor
hfs party are fit to be trusted with such
powers. A Parliament with this bound-
less” authority would be able to send the
country up the financial spout, and Mr.
Deakin seems to have no doubt that be an
his party would promptly send it there.
Like a noble son of his country, he accord-
ingly warns the public of , the dar l ger V fl lt
a thousand pities, though, that he did not
explain how the power that now lies in the
reservoir’’ is subject to the control of. the
people, while its removal to the Federal circle
would remove it from that control. For it
must not be overlooked for a moment that a 1
K powers now asked by the Commonwealth
are held by the States within their own
boundaries. So far, Mr. Deakin has not
objected to the State Parliaments having
these powers “unlimited, inexplicable and
indefinable,” so, presumably, he iigrees with
the arrangement. The only visible explana-
tion of why he does not want tb el ? t^ aI | s ‘
ferred to the Commonwealth is that he
knows the people who are in the Common-
K Parliament —in particular the Lib-
Traf party which, he says, is bound to be in
nower presently. Mr. Deakin
faced with this alternative. Either the
Commonwealth Parliament (and m particu-
lar X Liberal party in that Parliament)
inferior to the State Houses (some
which being nominee chambers, dont
make an, pretence ot represent, ng the
pponle) or he talks nonsense. If he will
peop 1, Commonwealth Parlia-
-1“ 1 (and especially the Liberal part,
in that Parliament) is inferior to the
State Houses, we will leave it
at^that—merely wondering why Deakin
took so much trouble to create an
inferior Parliament a few years ago. If, on
the other hand, he will not admit it, but still
unfioves the National Parliament is superior.
h bf« varn about the danger of removing
powers 8 from inferior Parliaments to a
superior one is obvious leg-pulling.
We Ask for Bread and Ye Hand Us
Bricks.
Now that the unemployed begin to haunt
the public offices in Melbourne in quest of
work, the recent remarks of one more manu-
facturer are of special interest. The manu-
facturer in question is J. A. McDougall,
of the Austral Nail Works, where nails,
netting, staples, barbed wire, etc., are, or
were, turned out in quantities. McDougall
stated, in a cold, mercenary tone of voice,
that though he was still making a few naus
he was about to quit the production of barbed
wire, and was turning importer. It paid
him better; though, unfortunately, it paid
the employees not at all. The duty on
barbed wire is 10 p.c. ad val. against Brit-
ish goods; 15 p.c. against others, which is
like a ghastly joke—the sort of joke that a
revenue tariffist like Jokook would be guilty
of. Four years ago, McDougall employed
45 men, at adult union wages, on barbed-
wire making machines; to-day 15 of those
men are idle, and there is every probability
of more becoming so. He hadn’t, he said,
the details of importations handy, but he
mentioned that the sales of Victorian barbed
wire had degenerated in this fashion: —
1910 91,112 cwt.
1911 89,905 cwt.
1912 61,037 cwt.
The foreigner, it will be observed, has put
on his usual stranglehold! McDougall
further mentioned that when Customs Mini-
ster Tudor lately sent out certain schedules
for manufacturers to fill in, he (McD.) com-
plied, and also offered to let Customs officers
look through his books. He asked for Pro-
tection —the genuine Protection that was
promised in March and April, 1910
—and some of his employees did
likewise • and they got nothing! Cus-
toms Minister Tudor, in whose electorate
several nail- and barbed-wire works are situ-
ated, will here note that McDougall
doesn’t suffer to any large extent by this
ruin of an Australian industry. Some of
his capital is lying idle at present, but he
will manage to make bread and cheese, with
an occasional pint to wash it down, by im-
porting ; and when the local industry is
finally killed, he will be able to recoup his
losses at his leisure, the farmer, the chief
consumer, paying the bill as usual. But the
discarded employees are in no such pleasant
position. They are out of work, and must
go elsewhere to seek it. They must turn to
the poorly-paid primary industries, and with
more and more unemployment prevalent they
will find it ever more difficult to get work.
Which is why hundreds of them haunt the
Public Works offices. But the employee who
produces barbed wire is, after all, only a
trifling sort of artisan, though useful. He
merely takes two coils of imported wire,
feeds them into an imported machine, and
passes out on to a lorry the rolls of finished
barbed wire. He is a mere detail in a com-
plex piece of mechanism. For every man
thus employed there should in Australia be
at least a dozen clever, ingenious mechanics
making the marvellous machines that enable
the other man to engage in secondary manu-
factures, and performing the various skil-
ful, intricate processes that turn raw iron
ore into articles of higher commercial value.
The Protection that Australia wants is not
the sort that will tentatively assist a few
poor secondary industries, but will make it
a great manufacturing, self-contained, self-
reliant Commonwealth. Our present disaster
is that Tudor. Fisher, Hughes and co.
have but the faintest glimmering idea of
such a large, statesmanlike policy.
Australia As It Could Be.
“P.H.” throws in his suggestion: —
Everyone who knows the “inside” of Australia
will agree with “Aquarius” (B. 16/1/T3) in advo-
cating the conservation of the rainfall of the Mur-
ray Basin; but I think he is pessimistic when he
says: “The interior of Australia cannot be attached
to civilisation until this territory (the Murray
Basin) is made water-famine proof, and thus turned
into a base for attacking the country further north
and north-west.” For there is another means
whereby that region could be made a permanent
source of wealth, instead of the precarious possession
it now is. That means is a railway system designed
primarily to remove millions of cattle and sheep
swiftly and cheaply over long distances —for ex-
ample, from the Flinders to the Murrumbidgee,
from the Barcoo to Cambridge Gulf, and from New-
castle Waters to Port Stephens
Would it pay? Yes—pay both the nation and the
individual grazier. The history of the pastoral in-
dustry is an appalling story of avoidable losses of
sheep and cattle. According to a graph in the
Commonwealth Year Book, No. 5 (page 357), Aus-
tralia held 12,300,000 cattle in 1894, and 106,000,000
sheep in 1891. By 1902 these numbers were re-
duced by starvation to seven million cattle and 54
million sheep. Since 1902 the numbers have gradu-
ally increased, till in 1910 we had 111 n ) 1 'J} 0I l cattle
and 92 million sheep. Now, I contend that there
was natural pasture enough in Australia to keep the
numbers up at least to the 1891-4 figures For as
Statist Knibbs remarks: The condition of drought
can hardly affect the whole of the continent at the
Same time. . .A more than ordinarily fortunate con-
dition in one part of the continent .ordinarily im-
nlies drought conditions in another. (Page 89.)
Thus, while stock were dying of -hunger grass with-
in 1000 or 1200 miles withered to dust, or was
destroyed bv fire. There have been seasons when
Queensland ‘could have kept all the stock in Aus-
tralia fat for six* months. The same is true of N. S.
Wales; and it is probable that every year a simi ar
condition obtains for several months in the North-
ern Territory and Westralia. Assuming that the
numbers could have been kept up to the maxima
above quoted, the loss to Australia during the 16
vears from 1895 to 1910 was upwards of 400 mil-
lions sterling, that sum being about the difference
between the value of the wool mutton, beef hides
etc., actually produced from the diminished flocks
and herds, and a vro rata return from 106 million
sheep and 12 million cattle. One-fourth of the
amount spent in railway construction and equipment
would have saved most of this enormous sum. The
cost to graziers would not average a shilling per
sheep and* 10s. per head of cattle, for it must be re-
membered that it seldom would be necessary to move
all the stock in a district, and often, for several
vears running, it would not be necessary to move
inv Further, fat stock have to be sent to the Coast
in any case, and the trip to grass and water would
often be in the direction of the market Another
important point is that, during a drought, the land
rests and when rain comes the grass is especially
abundant and nutritious. During 20 years’ resi-
dence in Western Queensland I saw millions of acres
of such crops utterly wasted for want of stock.
The subsidiary advantages of such a scheme are ob-
vious It would open up the Northern Territory, furnish
employment, and thus make immigration on a large
sca?e°easy, provide transit for Defence purposes and
fill up the empty interior with a giving and diver-
sified white population. The proposal should, therefore,
the attention of the Federal Railway Commis-
Son of Inquiry, now forming. Dike the Water Conser-
vation scheme of “Aquarius,” it is a big order, but
not too big for Australia, for both enterprise could
be carried out bv serviceable instalments. Needless
to add it is a job for the National Government, and
none other.
The Distrust of the Parson.
A thrill of horror ran through the ranks
of the Maoriland Methodist Conference when
a person of courage and conviction stated
an obvious and lamentable fact. “Somehow
or other,” he said, “I don’t know how it is,
there seems to be in the heart of the Maori-
land people a deep distrust of the parson.”
It is certainly very disturbing to get a thrust
of that kind in the assembly where more
than anywhere else Wowserism is confused
with godliness, but the average person has
none of that candid speaker’s difficulty in
tracing the alleged distrust to its source.
The thing that the parson sets out to do
may, or may not, be worth doing; his propa-
ganda may, or may not, be a thing of value
to the community. But the plain facts are
that what the parson sets out to do he does
not do, and that the thing he teaches is quite
other than the thing he professes to teach.
Of course there are exceptions, but in the
herd, mob or mass, parsons may be broadly
divided into two classes —the religious pro-
fessional men and the Wowsers. With the
person who enters the Church as men go in
for law or medicine, the public has only a
moderate amount of fault to find. He is
generally a good fellow, and might be held
in high esteem were it not for his trifling
failings of laziness, insincerity, dullness and
general incapacity for his job. Sometimes,
though the accomplishment grows rarer and
rarer, he can preach well, and is a fine
rhetorician; sometimes he is a scholar, and
widely read in all manner of subjects that
are quite outside the scope of everyday life;
sometimes he has a natural gift for shep-
herding, and can round up his flock with
great skill. Any one of these things he m«v
be or do. but seldom, if ever, does he com-
bine an ability to do all of them at once as
his job demands. The general public looks
upon him as a man paid to dp a job which
he carries through in a very indifferent
fashion, or as a man paid to do a job and
drawing his salary for playing golf or read-
ing to please himself in his study. On the
whole, however, the professional parson does
not exactly earn the distrust of the public.
His standing, in general estimation, is quite
as good as that of the auctioneer, and almost
as high as that of certain types of doctors
prominent in the B.M.A. It is the Wowser
parson—the sort that pervades a. Methodist
conference —which the public shies off as
dangerous, and not to be. trusted. These
people have, through habit and training,
come to be looked on as the spies and enemies
who make all innocent and light-hearted en-
joyment difficult. Through jaundiced eyes
they see evil in everything which can give a
wholesome brightness to life. They are the
moral police of an ethical code which plain
John Smith believes in his heart to be a
ridiculous and shameful one. Knowing
something of life, and knowing the average
Wowser parson’s ignorance of it, John is
unwilling to trust him or take him into his
confidence. His snuffle annoys, his hysterical
hunt for sin irritates, and his ignorance is a
source of danger to all that the average
human creature holds worth while. Ihe
trouble about the whole business is that
neither sort of parson identifies himself with
the people. He lives a life apart, hedged
round and allegedly sanctified from the gross
world, and, as a natural consequence, the
gross world has no use for the parson, .and
believes in its worldly heart that it is a
better and brighter and happier world with-
out him. Here and there one finds the plain
parish priest—priest still, whatever his creed
may be —who enters in the people s work
and sorrow and joy, and wins a love and
esteem which is given to no other. Him the
people trust; but he grows rarer and rarer
in Wowser-haunted areas like Maoriland,
and the chances are that if he strayed into
the Methodist conference they would mistake
him for .Tupas Iscariot, and gather all the
mud of the Potter’s Field in the rainy season
to throw at his kindly head. Meanwhile,
pubs are closed and churches opened. but
they are sadlv empty churches, and all evi-
dences point to the fact that they will be
sadder and emptier still before the parson
discovers that there is something seriously
wrong.
The struggles of Joe Cook to sink the fiscal
issue become more desperate every day; for
the ancient Freetrade rump of his party
shows a tendency to get more and more rope-
able. Joe rasps out at them that he will
refer the matter to a referendum, or to a
non-political, non-party scientific board. By
way of answer to that, he recently got a
letter from some 40 or 50 ignorant house-
wives around Chatswood way, demanding
that all duties be taken off so that the cost
of food, rent and clothing be reduced. I hey
think houses are imported. Joe whispered back
that any suggestion to take off duties would
wreck the party without reducing the cost of
rent Thereupon somebody else demanded
that’ the duties be taken off food (which the
farmer grows), clothing, farming machinery,
fencing wire and building material, so as to
leave a little money in the pockets ot the
farmers to enable them to develop the re-
sources of this great country. And Joe
dosn’t know what to do with it. He sees
the truth of the matter —that the country
has awakened to the fact that the most im-
portant thing in life under existing circum-
stances is continuity of employment; and
without Protection, and High Protection at
that there is no chance of continuous em-
ployment. It’s all very well to create a Para-
dise in which one can live like a fighting
cock on £1 per week so long as the £1 per
week is available. But unless the filthy £1
is forthcoming, there might as well be - no
Paradise. In fact, it would be better if there
were none; the tantalising prospect would
not be there to embitter the feelings. Cook.
naturally, wants a continuous job, too; and
the chance of getting that job rests on keep-
ing the mass of the people deaf, dumb and
blind concerning the fiscal issue. The people,
on the other hand, care not a hang about
Joe’s job. All they are interested in is con-
tinuity of their job at good wages; and they
are wise enough to know that that depends
upon Australia doing its own producing and
manufacturing. Wherefore, time. Joe
ties a stone round the neck of the fiscal issue
and heaves it into deep water, sundry cor-
respondents and others dive in and cut the
string, and the infernal thing won t sink, and
.Toe’s effort to show that his interests and
the public’s are identical remains a dead
failure.
Son of a Fool.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gyved and chained in his father's home,
He toiled 'neath a conqueror's rulej
Bowed to the earth in the land of his birth:
The Slave who was Son of a Fool.
Poor remnant he of a conquered race,
Long shorn of its power and pride,
No reverence shone in his sullen face
When they told how that race had died.
But the meed that he gave to his father’s
name
Was a down-drooped head and a flush of
shame.
Burned in his brain was the pitiful tale
Of a sabre too late unsheathed ;
Deep in his heart lay the poisoned dart
Of the shame that his sire bequeathed:
The searing shame of a laggard life,
Of an arm too weak in the hour of strife.
Oh, the Fool had reigned full many a year
In the Land of the Bounteous Gifts,
Dreaming and drifting, with never a fear,
As a doomed fr >ol oleasantly drifts;
And he ate his fill of the gifts she gave—
The Fool who was sire of a hopeless Slave.
Through years of plenty and years of peace
He lolled in the pleasing shade,
Marking his flocks and his herds increase,
Watching his waxing trade ;
And he smiled when he heard of the old
world’s wars,
With never a care for his own rich stores.
Year by year as his harvest grew,
He gleaned with a lightsome heart;
His barns he filled, and he sowed and tilled,
Trading in port and mart.
Proud of his prowess in sport and trade
Was the Fool, who scoffed at an alien raid.
Little he recked of the gathering cloud
That boded a swift disgrace.
Was he not seed of a manly breed,
Proud son of a warlike race?
And he told of the deeds that his sires had
done —•
While he wielded a bat in the place of a
gun.
Small were his fears in the rich fat years,
Loud was his laugh of scorn
When they whispered low of a watching foe,
Greedy for gold and corn ;
A foe grown jealous of trade and pow’r,
Marking the treasure, and waiting the hour.
’Twas a cheerful Fool, but a Fool foredoomed
Gazed out on a clear spring morn;
And his eye ranged wide o’er the countryside,
With its treasures, its kine and corn.
And, “Mine, all mine!” said the prosperous
Fool.
“And it never shall pass to an alien rule!”
And, e’en when the smoke of the raiders’
ships
Trailed out o’er the northern skies,
His laugh was loud: “ ’Tis a summer cloud,”
Said the Fool in his Paradise.
And, to guard his honor, he gave a gun
To the feeble hands of his younger son.
Oh. a startled Fool, and a Fool in haste
Awoke on a later day,
When they sped the word that a foe laid
waste
His ports by the smiling bay,
And his voice was shrTll as he bade his sons
Haste out to the sound of the booming guns.
He was brave, they tell, as a fool is brave,
With an oath ’tween his hard-clenched
teeth, „ ,
When he found the sword that he fain would
wave ;te
Held fast in its rusty sheath; .
When he learned that the hand, so skilled in
play,
Was the hand of a child that fatal day.
And scarce had he raised his rallying cry,
Scarce had he called one note,
When he died, as ever a. fool must die,
With his war-song still in his throat.
And an "open ditch was the hasty grave
Of the Fool who fathered a hopeless Slave.
They point the moral, they tell the tale,
And the old world wags its head :
“If a Fool hath treasure, and Might prevail,
Then the Fool must die,” ’tis said.
And the end of it all is a broken gun
And the heritage gleaned by a hapless son.
Gyved and chained in his fathers home,
He toiled 'neath a conquerors rule;
While they flung in his face the taunt of his
race:
A Slave and the Son of a Fool. _

A particularly cheering feature of Prime
Minister Fisher’s policy speech at Mary-
borough on Monday was his assurance that,
if the Referenda proposals were agreed to, the
New Protection would be immediately put
into operation, and that, in any event, the
tariff would be revised. The present state of
the tariff amounts to an intolerable scandal.
Australia has declared for Protection not
once merely, but so often that the Free-
trader has withdrawn himself and his ruined
creed from the political arena. But we still
lack the sort of Protection that really pro-
tects. The products of cheap European and
even cheaper Asiatic laborers are pouring
into the Commonwealth on an unprecedented
scale, to the detriment of Australian indus-
tries and immigration, and to the fostering
of unemployment. That calamity needs to be
stopped without a, moment’s unnecessary de-
lay. If the New Protection is not validated,
the way will, unfortunately, be open to manu-
facturers to do a certain amount of sweat-
ing ; but there is consolation in the knowledge
that, thanks to. our .so-called Socialistic legis-
idtion to Arbitration Courts, Factory Acts
and the like —such industrial injustice will be
. limited in extent, and, comparatively speak-
ing, mild in form. For the rest, Fisher’s
speech once more strikingly exhibits his party
as the party which is possessed of imagina-
tion, the party which has no doubts as to
Australia s destiny, the party which Does
I lungs. Labor has made bad mistakes. But
in lederal politics it has achieved an enor-
mous amount of good. While Liberalism
was yapping feebly to the effect that no “Loy-
alist would consider the proposition of “ban-
ishing the Imperial squadron” and starting
a ‘tinpot mosquito fleet,” Labor went starkly
ahead, and founded a navy which already
commands the world’s attention and approval.
Amidst an almost universal Liberal howl of
‘conscription,” Labor introduced a compul-
sory-service system which most reasonable
people only cavil at nowodavs on the grounds
that it doesn’t go far enough. In these, and
in a dozen other directions. Federal Labor has
shown itself to be a party which not only
promises but performs—to a certain extent,
anyhow. With such a record behind it, the
Fisher Administration may fairly ask the
country to believe, next May, that the vigor-
ous forward policy foreshadowed on Mondav
last will be accomplished in the fulness of
time.
- -+
The further it goes the more tangled the
Commonwealth Government gets over the
“wireless” business. Three or four years
ago it imported an expert who, probably to
justify himself, produced a system which lie
said was his own. This system was patented,
and the specifications were lodged in the or-
dinary way with the Patents Office. But the
appliances, which were alleged to have been
made according to the plans and specifica-
tions thus lodged, have been kept strictly
under lock and key. Even “wireless” ex-
perts of the British navy have been refused
permission to enter the sacred Common-
wealth stations. The Marconi, or some
other people, suspecting something from
this extraordinary furtiveness, built up a
machine from the plans and specifications
in the Patents Office. As they expected,
they could not get from it the results which
the Commonwealth stations were getting.
Only one conclusion, then, could be come to
—the Commonwealth officials were not
using the implements which they alleged
they were using, and which alone thev were
entitled to use. The conclusion may have
been wrong; but it was the natural ‘one to
come to. Whether it was wrong or not
could have been settled in half an hour.
These people, the owners of other patents,
suspected that their brains were being
nicked . and their property stolen. An
inspection would have either proved or
disproved that. If the stations were being
conducted honestly there could be no valid
objection to that inspection; for if they
ivere using nothing but their own imple-
ments, thev would be protected by their
patents. Still, every effort to get an in-
spection failed. Finally the High Court
was appealed to; and. of course, the High
Court made an order granting an inspection.
In effect, it said that either the authorities
were merely childish or they were cheats.
If they were fnerely childish, their objec-
tions were not ,worthy of attention ; if they
were cheats. th,en the fact ought to be ex-
posed. But the Government, through its
officers, were not done with their money-
wasting fatuousness yet. Though the Com-
monwealth’s own High Court had been em-
phatic, they announced their intention of
going on past the High Court to the Privy
Council. When the Constitution was
framed and a High Court was established,
the apneal to the Privy Council was re-
tained for the satisfaction of those who be-
lieved that otherwise the Crimson Ties
would snap; but it was never supposed
that an Australian National Government
would go past its own Court. However, its
officials are apparently desperate, and don’t
mind what mud they throw at anv Court
or what expense they thrust upon the Com-
monwealth so long as thnv get another
chance to maintain their childish perversity
“or worse.

‘‘The Belle of New York,” the reliable old
‘East Lynne” of musical comedy, came back
to Sydney last week, and started her pro-
fitable work of reform at Sydney Theatre
Royal. Miss Blanche Browne played Violet
Gray, but the role was out of her line. The

CRITERION.
The smile of the
optimist—old
Sam Graham,
the inventor
(Ray L. Royce).
New York character differs as much from
the trail, twittering, ethereal young person
whom Gertie Millar first introduced to
London as a beefsteak does from a souffle.
Miss Browne has made a specialty of the
soufllfe variety of part, and she seems unable
to lose the habit. Leslie Holland grappled
with the role of Ichabod Bronson —the Wow-
ser who didn’t know it till years afterwards
What a priceless character Hugh Morton
would have made of Ichabod had be but had
the word “Wowser” to inspire him ! Leslie
Holland lacks unction : he is too mercurial.
But he has a sense of humor, and his appear-
ance is satisfactory. The hit of the evenin'*
was delivered by Jack Cannot in the capa”
city of tfiht pearl a.ipongst imbeciles, Karl
von Pumpfrnmck. Cannot is one of the most
valuable articles in the* laughter-making line
that the iV\ illiamson management has un-
earthed foi; years. He is capable of supply-
ing a touch of hilarity,to a graveyard on a
wet evening; he might even bring a glimmer
to a meeting of the N.S.W. Freetrade
League in its Pitt-street cellar. The other
outstanding success was supplied by Miss
Jessie Lonnen, whose Mamie Clanev was a
triumph of realism and absurdity. Miss
Dorothy Brunton’s Fifi was received with
enthusiasm; Frank Greene portrayed the
joys and sorrows of the younger Bronson
W1 1 sure touch and a melodious voice •
and Doc Sniff kins, Kenneth Mugg, Blinky

the performance. “The Belle” will remain

A further consideration of “The Fortune
Hunter, now stalking a box-office fortune
at Sydney Lntenon, shows that the author,
W inch ell Smith, contributes nothing to this
comedy but a new idea and a rattle of dia-
logue. The construction of the plot is quite
the most amateur thing seen here in
a popular play. The first act is quite unneces-
sarily “bumped out” by the felicitations
over Harry Ivellog’s partnership, and this
is unfortunate, since it suggests that Harry
ivellog is going to be the hero. The second act,
set in a derelict and soda-logged chemist’s
snoj), is nothing but a series of interviews
Lach character drifts in from the one street
door, makes his few well-chosen remarks, and
drifts out the same door. The audience gets
the vague idea that the backblocks village
must be the size of Chicago; for the old
chemist is going out to see the banker, and
the old banker is coming in to see the chem-
ist, and the chemist’s daughter is going out
to find the lost chemist or the strayed banker
all through the act. And Wincliell Smith
tells us in the third act, where the soda-
logged chemist’s shop has become a sort of
Washington Soul’s, loaded to the Plimsoll
with complexion creams, catarrh cures, cash
registers and soda-geysers, that its proprie-
tor, Nathaniel Wowser Duncan, is delighted
with its success. Yet this writer gives
Nathaniel only a week before he is bankrupt.
For the whole business done in this gorgeous
soda-palace consists of one patch applied to
a bruise on the forehead of a drunk, and
even that is not paid for. The soda turbine
is not even started ; not one member of the
public appears to ask for so much as a pill;
and the cash-register is as silent as the re-
mains of Jezebel. But in the previous act,
where the whole stock consisted of one bottle
vanilla, one bottle whisky, and one artesian
sodawater bore, the till actually received 10
cents, and three drinks were sold, while, as
the curtain fell, 13 village maidens fell over
Nathaniel in a sale-time rush for the last of
the vanilla. The truth, which will be brought
out by the Registrar next week, is that the
village maidens boycotted the shoo as soon
as they discovered that the sombrely beauti-
ful young man had been scratched for the
marriage handicap. However, Fred Niblo
(Wowser-in-Chief) and Miss Josephine
Cohan (floor-scrubber), supported by a host
of cheerful rubes, carry the wobbly plot
safely over the rocky places, and find happi-
ness in the final thunderstorm. .
At The Little Theatre “The Man on the
Box” is keeping on friendly terms with the
man m the box-ottice, which proves as no-
thing else can that his relations with
theatre-goers are _ eminently satisfactory,
lhis good-fellowship has been enhanced by
a scheme of the! management, whereby at
the close of the matinees (each Thursday,
by the way) stall-holders are invited to
drink tea on the stage and discuss plays and
players, art, beauty and other trifles dear to
a matinee girl. A pub full of beer is
stationed at the corner of the street for
Hard Cases who want to discuss horse-
racing and ballet girls. But in their case
all drinks are sixpence each. That is the
difference between art and luxury.
* * * *
"Puss in Boots” is booming at Her
Majesty’s, if a domestic animal so muffled
can be said to do such a thing. The wonder-
ful Horse is still on view, .the forest-owning
Ogre continues his career as landed pro-
prietor and public nuisance, the Catland
Courtiers remain on deck —in brief, the en-
tire menagerie is holding its collective head
nearly as high as the N. S. Wales debt.
* * * *
“Dr. Wake’s Patient,” who was booked
for a painless death at the end of this week,
has revived under an Easter diet, and there
will be no job for the undertaker for 10
days more. Then “A Woman of Impulse”
will take the place of the dear departed at
the Palace.
“THE FORTUNE HUNTER ."
The gloom of the pessimist—H. H. Wallace
as “ Watty .”
On the unimpeachable authority of the
advt., it is gathered that anv extra wear
and tear of fodtpaths in the neighborhood of
the Adelphi is entirely due to “From Con-
vent to Throne”; and since George Marlow
doesn t have to repair worn-out footpaths,
he has decided that the present Marlow-
drama is good enough for another couple of
weeks.
The rush of England’s (or the world’s)
most popular artistes to the Tivoli still con-
tinues. The latest is Madge Temple, who
also suiters from being “the fashion plate of
the variety stage.” Her turn is largely a
repetition of those of her very numerous fore-
runners, and with I O U’s in great supply,
fashion plates are olentiful even in the
streets ; so Miss Temple’s return doesn’t seem
likely to burst the Mclntosh coffers. With

Much of the charm of “Milestones” at
Melbourne Royal, lies in its artistic natural-
ising of orthodox theatrical enects The
people who last the full 52 years of th?
g or .y have ,a surface appearance of truth
in the final act, though their picturesciue
presentment of old age is untrue to th
modern times they live in. For that matter

old-fashioned person than his previous self

than up-to-date ancients. Thev talk, move

represented as wheezy totterers to the tomb
Ihe shades of (say) the late £ £ Smith
Henry Parkes and Lady Dorothy Xevili
drop into the d.-c. at the Royal, aiid laugh
at John Rhead and his womenkind. But as
works of theatrical art they are just what
is wtinted. they are strictly in accordance
with stage traditions, and are amply justi-
fied by the Immortal Bard of long ago, who
put the shrunken- pantaloon into slippers
at <>o, and consigned him to second child-
hood and mere oblivion a dozen years later.
-t-his is the sixth week of “The Tart in
the Monkery” at the Princess’s, and still
the King of France remains incapable of
dealing effectually with Brother Paul. Which
is to say that Providence has not relaxed
its efforts on behalf of that nice young man.
Anderson’s great murderdrama of New York
life will, presumably, present the Corpse
in the Pulpit for another week or two at
Melbourne King’s. There is much food for
amazement in “The Evil Men Do,” apart
from the clever juvenile (Iza Crossley) who
cheeks the Divorce Court Judge. Cyril
Mackay, as the good but gullible young
merchant of Noo Yark, is an astounding
circumstance; also, the dunderheaded vil-
lainy of Roy Redgrave is a feast of sur-
prises. In the first place, the remorseless
Redgrave is named Harold, a label hitherto
reserved for suffering virtue or harmless in-
anity. Harold, having broken the rules of
nomenclature by revealing the black heart of
a Jasper or a Luke, staggers the audience
by palming himself off as the gentle shep-
herd of his murdered brother’s flock. In
Trinity Church he meets his doom under
new and original conditions. He starts to
pray and preach to a limited congregation,
whose pews are as oases in a desert of
aisle; but his hypocrisy so annoys Miss
Wilton that she climbs into the rostrum,
tears the surplice from his chest, and stabs
him to death. After which he remains
with his chalked face and ochred chest
hanging over the pulpit ledge whilst Cyril
Mackay and his divorced wife forgive one
another. And not even a verger comes
along to remove the carcase or mop up the
blud.
■Visitors to the Bijou, or as many of them
as think, continue to come away under the
gloomy suspicion that “The Grafters” is a
touring advt. for an unborn exhibition in
San Francisco. A Yankee vaudeville show

dollars. Therefore, when the second act
begins to hang heavy on the mind of a
thoughtful observer, he finds himself wonder-
ing whether the previous section of the en-
tertainment was grafted on to "The Graft-
ers,” or is the main purpose of its produc-
tion. After all, there is no reason why such
things should not be run on advt. lines. The
time may come when “The Chocolate Sol-
dier,” for example, will be bought up by a
firm of cocoa manufacturers, and the burden
of Bumerli’s song will be that Blank’s choco-
late is the Best.
“THE MONK AND THE WOMAN.

Meanwhile, “The Chocolate Soldier” re-
tains its original art form, save for two or
three lamentable attempts at improvement
by Percy Popoff. A final performance of
Strauss’s opera happens at Her Majesty’s to
morrow (Friday), and on Saturday comes
“The Count of Luxembourg” for the first
time in this country. It is an adaptation of
a German opera. The music is by the com-
poser of “The Merry Widow,” and the inevi-
table waltz is said to be located on a stair-
case. In one of Anderson’s dramas there
was a horse that walked up stairs, but the
attraction of a human couple waltzing up a
ladder will be quite new.

The latest turns at the Opera House are
Rosie Lloyd and Will Poluski. Ilosie sings
three songs, and scores heavily in the two
that don’t come first. She has an ear-
biting voice, a keen enunciation and a fresh
young saucy style of humor in her by-play.
The success of Rosie and her catchy ditties
at last Saturday’s matinee suggested that
the great heart of the amphitheatre will go
forth to join her in the glad refrains. Will
Poluski, whose songs are subservient to. his
frivols, fills the bill as a quaintly grotesque
comedian. For the rest there are the Krem-
kas, the Maxinis an< l others who were there
before, including the Patty-Franks and
others who have done their dash and are
about to go away.
The Wonder Show and Animal Circus at
Wirths’ Hippodrome continue to be amusing

monkeys cease from acrobating and the Fat

and supply that voracious customer with a
full meal. Curiosity, satisfied _ for the time
being by a menu of freakish things, breathes
heavily and remarks “My oath !”

At West’s this week a silent ghostly com-
pany of Parisian mummers is playing
“Zaza” in natural colors. The new film-
drama is interesting to them who, remem-
bering Nellie Stewart in the name-part, can
note the points of difference between the
original story and the. English version of it,
and pleasantly shocking to a lot of other
people who see Zaza for the first time. A
comedy billed as “Good Morning, Judge,
is humorous in sundry places, and the other
pictures deal with love, courtship, hue and
cry and landscape in an almost flickerless
manner.

The Lyric (P’ran) continues to rejoice in
two full programmes a week, supported by an
orchestra that hardly needs to blow its own
trumpet, and assisted by Upton-Brown s lec-
turettes for the young at Saturday matinees.
This week he will tell them as much about
the land of the Turks as. is good for their
understanding. The principal nhoto-plays m
the current programme are “The Marriage
Secret” and “Behind the Scenes n The
laugh-raisers are “A Widow’s \\ ues, A
Cabby’s Nightmare” and “Pimple s Rent Col-
lecting” ; and a mining drama, entitled Ihe
Eldorado Lode” pans out about -dwt. per

McMahon is going to give Shaw’s philosophy
a chance to soak into the top soil of conven-
tional fallacy before producing “David Bal-
lard and Dyson’s Australian playlet on the
15th and 16th.
Adelaide Royal has got fairly into its
winter stride with “Ben Hur.” The first
cousin to “The Sign of the Cross” is having
an enormous boom, though the Royal stage
is. rather cramped for some of the spectacu-
lar effects. For the public to get
inside at all, it is necessary to book
a week ahead, and Manager Mus-
r,T ars the Smile that Won’t Come
tltt. Ihe cold weather is making Brans-
combe’s Dandies thoughtful. The King’s,
always strong in song-and-dance, has Fred
Curran, lately from London, and Maisie
I osner, the former “phenomenon” of "The
Fatal Wedding”; but the big turn is the
dog-horse-monkey show put up by Schepp's
animals. West’s Wondergraph, Empire, and
Pav. (open all day) have been showing a
selection of films lately found good by Syd-
ney and Melbourne, with the addition of
home-grown jumps and falls and crowds
—all from the Oakbank race meeting.
South Aus. is very gradually feeling its
way towards the appointment of a fourth
Supreme Court Judge, a step which has been
talked about for years. In the absence of
Gordon on the Sugar Commission, Buchanan,
the Master of the Supreme Court, was given
temporary rank. Then Homburg died, and
Murray—who had declined the temporary job
• —accepted the permanent billet. On Gordon’s
return, Buchanan was made President of
the newly-formed Arbitration Court; and
now he has been given what so far as S.
Aus. is concerned is the unprecedented posi-
tion of “temporary Judge,” to clear on a
lot of criminal trials this month.
Garnet Wolseley, who died in Britain
last week, had an astonishing record from
first to last, and his only grievance against
Providence was that a big war never came
along in his; time. Covered with scars of
battle and service medals, and with one eye
gone, he forced himself by sheer merit out
of the ruck of younger officers, and in 1870,
when 37 years of age, got the job of put-
ting down an Indian ruction at the Red
River, Canada. Afterwards, in Ashantee,
Zululand and Egypt, he showed something
of the stuff that was in him. The war for
the suppression of Arabi Pasha was his first
performance. With absolute precision and
certainty he tackled a job not unlike that of
the Italians in Tripoli, and forced the Arab
and Egyption position at Tel-el-Kebir, which
the brown persons had been fortifying for
many months, in something under 20
minutes. The la<?li Of British gore spent in
the campaign made the business look too
tame, and Wolseley probably lost a lot of
credit by the very perfection of his arrange-
ments. Roberts, his only possible rival, got
the S’African job when things were at their
worst; but if Wolseley’s advice had been
taken a few months earlier, the war would
probably have lasted weeks instead of years.
The misfortune of the soldier just dead was
that he was born about a generation too late.
The command in a big scrap like that of the
Crimea might have made him a Marl-
borough ; as it is, he goes out with about
the best war record a man could acquire
whose ability ripened in a time of profound
European peace.
“ THE MONK AND THE WOMAN,"
MELBOURNE PRINCESS’S.
Ha! Ha ! The king is about to force his
attentions upon the unwilling Liane (the
Pearl of the Court).
The news arrives as this paper goes to
press that Justice Rich, of the N. S. Wales
Supreme Court, has accepted the vacancy on
the High Court Bench created by the resig-
nation of Mr. Piddington. The selection is
as good a one as could well have been made
from the ranks of the State Judges. The new
man is a sound Equity lawyer, is young and
fit and owns an, eminently judicial mind.
the way. the yarn that the position was pre-
viously offered to Justice Street is without
foundation. One man and one only—namely
Rich—got the offer after Piddington decided
to return to the Bar. Which is as it should
be. This is the sort of office that it is par-
eularly unseemly to hawk about.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“W.”: Concerning actor-legislators
(B. 6/3/’l3). Ebenezer Ward, of
Adelaide, may als<j be ipentiopcd. He
was a member of j(3. V. Brooke’s com-
pany, and was greatly in request at
amateur theatricals later. First elected
to Parliament in 1870, he sat in the
Assembly for 20 years, and then was
for nine years in the .Council. He held
Ministerial office for about two years
(between 1875 and 1877) under Pre-
miers Boucaut and Colton. He was a
journalist, too, and away back in the
’6o’s succeeded the Much-Travelled R.
S. Smythe as sub-editor of Adelaide
Advertiser. Afterwards he ran the
Farmers’ Mess (short for Messenger).
He began his press life on the Morn-
ing Post under Algernon Borthwick,
afterwards Lord Glenesk. “Ebby,” as
he is familiarly called, is now in Wes-
tralia visiting sons and grandsons. He
has all the Bohemianism of the old-
time actor and journalist, and never
accumulated any shekels. Some day he is going to
write his biography.
From Paris: “Kismet” has been such a failure
here that it has been taken olf after a few perform-
ances. The Oriental beggar had the advantage, too,
of being represented by the greatest French actor,
Lucien Guitry. But he buried the play under the
monstrous weight of the “production,” and that
and the fact that Parisians don’t like plays that
have been produced first in other cities settled its
bacon. A witty Parisian manager, with the fate
of “Kismet” fresh in his memory, announces that
the play he is about to produce is “in full possession
of its artistic virginity.” And there is no doubt
at all that, for this reason, it will have a far
better chance than “Kismet” had, though intrinsi-
cally it may not be nearly so good.
“J.F.H.” (from London): Tittell-Brune (with the
hyphen conspicuous on the programmes and posters)
has at last scored a hit here, playing at the Lyceum
in a new and bustling version of “Nell Gwynn.”
The critics are practically all pleased. The
Chronicle says, “Nell is acted magnificently—it is
a really fine, popular performance, full of heart and
humor.” The Telegraph, Daily Mail and Standard
refer to the little woman’s “charm.” Walkley, in
the Times says, Tilda “threw herself into the part
with the jolliest vigor. She is freshly and richly
humorous.” Altogether, in fact, this one perform-
ance lifted her farther to the front than all her pre-
vious efforts lumped together.
Emilie Melville, who twinkled in leading comic
opera parts in Australia 30 years ago, is still in
the starry way. A month ago she was twinkling
at the Court Theatre, New York, in “Peg o’ My
Heart.”
“0.K.”: Oscar Asche’s creation of a grunting,
middle-aged and utterly undignified Shylock can
hardly be said to improve on acquaintance, yet one
gets used to it. Familiarity breeds respect for the
ugly Jew on account of his crisp, up-to-date manner
of speaking the lines, although he doesn’t reveal any
previously-hidden truth in his impersonation of the
character. He shows no reason why such a Shylock
should have talked like a self-respecting Hebrew
of his racial resentment against the insulting Chris-
tians. All the same, he plays the revengeful, low-
down usurer so consistently as to justify the
beastly outrages he complains of. Given a Shylock
of reverend appearance and staid demeanor, it is
impossible to find any excuse for Antonio’s alleged
habit of spitting on his beard and calling him
names when they met on the Rialto. Asche’s
Shylock makes the abusive vulgarities of Antonio
quite conceivable and almost pardonable. He re-
pels sympathy for himself, although his pungent
utterance of his Jewish sentiments is always a
reminder that the other, sort of Shylock would
throw Antonio and his ’ friends into contempt.
Shakspeare’s idea of Shylock was probably a cross
between the surly, ill-conditioned Jew whom Asche
presents, and the moody, picturesque, Bible-reading
usurer whom Henry Irving somewhat idealised —a
man with an unpleasant personality, but with a
proud soul where Christians were concerned.
Florrie Matthews, one of the brightest and best-
known amateur actresses in Victoria, took boat for
Britain last week to try her luck on the stage. She
will get a fair chance. She is a niece of Julia
Matthews, the opera-bouffe star of yore ; and a male
cousin, who manages more than one theatre in the
Big Smoke, has promised to push her on for all she
is worth. Over-accentuation of ingenuousness in
ingenue characters was Florrie’s failing as an ama-
teur, but she has better qualifications as an actress
than many professionals of her slim and service-
able type.
“W J H.” : Jimmie Norrie, the silvery tenor, men-
tioned (B. 13/3/’l3) as having recently passed out
in England, was “discovered” in Melbourne by ex-
Speaker Mason, when he (Norrie) was working as a
lad on the Port Melbourne wharf, after arriving from
England as a stowaway. The old-time politician
heard a beautiful voice sounding out amongst the
chanteys of the saflor men, and took its owner in
charge, getting him to sing at several local concerts,
and so on. Norrie thought hard, went back to Eng-
land, and returned some years afterwards under en-
gagement to Williamson, Garner and Musgrove, when
he made a memorable hit at the Princess’s Theatre m
pantomime. Inside a week the sparrows were chirp-
ing his “Sweet Marie” around the city. Later on,
he was sublet to Rickards, with whom he soon had a
violent quarrel. The two were at supper at the old
White Hart one night, along with some friends, when
a dispute arose, and Norrie savagely attacked his
manager. Norrie expected the sack, as he was en-
tirely to blame; but Rickards, althflugh his face had
to be kept in bandages for some time, generously for-
gave his youthful assailant, and didn’t even deduct
his medical expenses from his smiter’s salarv.
“Rip”: The theatrical Combine doesn’t run the
risk of missing the financial mark by aiming at
artistic ensemble. There was an air of refinement
—-not a great air, but some air—about the Clarke-
Meynell production of “The Chocolate Soldier,” and
from first to last it was kept within the limits of
comedy-opera. The chorus of Bulgarian soldiers had
a little facial make-up, suggestive of racial character
and rough campaigning, and the girls were not ob-
trusivelv pink and white. This attention to detail
is wanting in the Combine’s revival. The soldiers
back from the war make no pretence of Bulgarian
color, neither do the girls who come to greet them.
And in the third act there is an interpolated dance
by Miss Vivien Talleur, the melody whereof, being
foreign to the operatic score, sounds strangely out
of place to critical ears. I’ll allow that it is a com-
plete success with the large majority of the audience.
It leaves their ears of artistic harmony untroubled,
because they haven’t any to speak of. And what
they have are in a crude state, and are not likely to
be cultivated by the Combine management.
“Pilsener”: Re “O’Blin’s” grievance against the
Repertory Theatre Club (B. 20/3/’l3)—what is it?
If “O’Blin” paid his hard-earned guinea to provide
a cash stimulus to the theatre fiusiness, he may rest
assured that his guinea has found its mark. Were
it not for his subscription and those of his co.-club
members, the theatre would not last year have been
able to produce Galsworthy’s “Pigeon,” Arnold Ben-
nett’s “What the Public Wants,” Shaw’s “Man and
Superman,” Louis Esson’s “The Time is Not Yet
Ripe,” and Tchekhov’s “The Seagull.” Other mem-
bers, in addition to the self-satisfaction they get in
helping this work, find further pleasure in hear-
ing the opinions of “scholars of huge mental dis-
placement” on subjects interesting to Repertorians
all the world over. If “O’Blin” doesn’t want to
hear these opinions, he needn't. Some members pay
their club subscriptions for the express purpose of
hearing them. Others pay for the convenience of a
free theatrical library. Others, again, because there
is a tea room; or because they want to act, and
can’t, and are not allowed to; or because they can
and are allowed to. The tastes of Repertorians are
many and varied. The harassed director would no
doubt be glad of a visit from “O’Blin” at the Club
rooms, when the grievance could be threshed out to
the accompaniment of another brand of “swank.
Pedantry is not the only “swank.”
“Yarriambiak”: The electoral roll for Melbourne
includes the name of one Cramwell, whose occupa-
tion is said to be theatre packer. Whether he was
born to the name and assumed the occupation for
the sake of consistency, or whether he was cut out
for the job and collared the name to suit it, or
whether he simply got both the name and the billet
promiscuously, is not stated in evidence.
(Continued on page 36.)
From The Bulletin’s tame detective: —
Sydney has had two queer killing cases on its
hands, and still has them, for that matter. The
first commenced on December 19, when what appears
to have been a drunken brawl in Market-street
(mid-city) ended in a professional boxer named
“Snowy” Fulton being stabbed to death. The 'street
was well lighted at the time, and there were 20 or
30 witnesses of the slaying; yet, at the inquest,
the ignorance of everybody was amazing. The
Coroner flatly refused to close the investigation until
at least a gleam of light was thrown in front of
him, and, after three months’ hard work by the
police, with the added inducement of a £2OO reward,
considerable progress has been made. Two men
have been arrested and committed for trial, and an
alleged eye-witness has minutely described the whole
proceedings. He named a man as having used a
butcher’s knife on Fulton, and put some of the
earlier witnesses who “didn’t know” or “couldn’t
remember ” in an awkward position. The police
consider this one of the most difficult murder jobs
they have had to deal with. In the other case, a
Chinaman was found shot dead near Parramatta, and
two youths, who were known to have been near-by at
the time, were arrested. They were brought before
the police court, were remanded, and for nearly a
week lay in gaol. Then a third youth\ gave him-
self up, stating that he had done the shooting in
self-defence. And, though two arrested youths had
practicallv seen him do it, they never breathed a
word to anybody, expecting, maybe, that the other
youngster would “do a bunk” while the police were
side-tracked. Chivalry upside down again.
WHAT IS AN ACTOR?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Walter Baker (giving evidence) : “As a rule, a
man is accepted as an actor if he has been given a
character in a cast.”
“3 he man who says ‘My Lord, the carriage waits,’
is he an actor?” “Yes, I know men who have made
fortunes by saying those few words.”
—lndustrial Court report.
Full qualified to share in weekly loots
Of treasury,
If he has strutted once abaft the “foots,”
An actor he;
If he hath made forgetment of his lines
And won the cabbages of shame, these signs
Are proof that actors need not know the ropes
Yet may have hopes.
He need not know his job if once he’s given
A part to play ;
Once in the cast he can’t be forced or driven
Empty away ;
His hands may go out of control, his feet
May disconcert him in a Way unmeet;
Stage fright may choke —he’ll wear the mummer’s
bays
For moral ways.
Weary am I, a humble speculator
In mines and things ;
Now do I see that the Finance called Greater
Is in the wings!
What asses Pierpont and Rockefeller are
When he who yokes his waggon to a “star”
Finds fortune leaning to him when he states
“The carriage waits.”
Nor Broken Hill nor Morgan’s Mount may show
The greater price
To actors who can deal that deadly blow
At lordly vice;
Who sneeringly inform the heavy man
“The baby’s gone, go find it if you can.”
But the world’s ransom is for him who states
“The carriage waits.”
How much more, then, should yet be paid to him,
The serving man— ~
The faithful hound, who, though his eyes are dim,
Does all he can? >. 1 ,
Who says, forgetting his own luckless plight,
“A sad home-coming for the squire to-night.”
How much for him who moans in accents dire
“The poor old squire” ?
How much for him who saves the beggared queen
From naughty kings— ,
The red-nosed slapstick bloke, heard when unseen
Within the wings?
How much for convicts wailing “Muriel” ?
How much for him who strikes the midnight bell?
For her who cries unto the titled cur,
“Unhand me, sir” ?
How much for her who screams, in paper snow,
“Gimme me cheild,”
For him who says, “God bless you all, I go
O’er oceans wild”?
What for the dreary blighter at the act
Who says, “I haven’t,” and with coarse impact
Butts the bad man (while Muriel with a tear)
Brings up the rear?
These by their fame are handsomely rewarded
For all they say,
Press agents see to it they are regarded
The proper way ;
But gold and honor, laurels Beauty flings,
And all the splendor of all earthly things
Offer themselves to genius when it states
“The carriage waits!”

A KINDRED FEELING ,
LANDSCAPEIST : “Ok, I love the trees, I love
them! Sometimes I feel that I could almost
embrace them. ”
FIGURIST (absently): “'How turn! You know
I often feel the same way with my models.”
“C.R.L.11.” : It’s a delightful little thrill
you get when, in a public place, the thoughts
of all the money you are going to try to make
to-morrow are switched off by the sight of
some fine human action. I was at Sydney
Railway Station a couple of nights ago, wait-
ing with a few others for a late Ulawarra
train on a cold, wind-swept platform. Sud-
denly a child’s muffled cries were heard, and
we looked at a cane carryall that had been
placed on the sheltered side of a seat. One
opened the basket. In it was a four-weeks-
old baby, crying and crying. The little mite
was alternately putting knock-out punches
on the sides of the basket, and getting half-
Nelson holts on himself. Then the Good
Woman stepped in. Handing over her own
sleeping baby to her husband, she lifted the
wee stray from the basket, opened her dress,
and soon the foundling was drinking con-
tentedly. In a moment the crying stopped,
and all one heard was a contented purr. And
while the baby purred the tears streamed
down a brown Australian mother-face. After-
wards the police took charge of the little Aus-
tralian who wasn’t wanted, our train came
in, and we all got on board. But that
mother! If a man could be sure of marry-
ing a woman like that, what else would
matter!
“J.F.”: You can get a pretty good idea of
the value of the ancient history that had to
rely upon the memory of the oldest inhabi-
tant by considering the yarns that our oldest
inhabitant pass on. For instance, there was a
Mr. W. F. Pullen, of Woolgoolga, whom the
S. M. Herald dug up after the N.S.W. State
Government’s knock-out in the Government
House case. The old gentleman was modest
enough to conceal his age, but he said: “I
was at the large meeting when Governor
Bourke’s statue was uncovered. As the
British ensign was taken off, Governor Gipps,
pointing to Government House, said, ‘Gov-
ernor Bourke built that residence under
authority from our Queen for her represen-
tative.’ That is over 70 years ago. I was
young at the time, but can mind the attitude
of Governor Gipps quite well, as he pointed
at Government House. I was attending
school in York-street, and the master went to
the demonstration with his scholars.” It
was on April 11, 1842, that Governor
Bourke’s statue was uncovered, Governor
Gipps was then living in the old house which
had housed all the Governors from Phillip
to himself, and the Government House over
which the dispute has arisen was not occu-
pied for some time after Bourke’s statue was
unveiled.

“Mr. Ocky” : When G.-G. Denman opened
Australia’s Naval College at Geelong re-
cently, a large bell, which is now in use at
the establishment, was enthused over. It
was originally on one of Nelson’s fighting
vessels, and was afterwards passed to the
old British ship Nelson, which was lent to
the Victorian Government from 1868 to 1878.
Geelong has another interesting bell in its
possession. In the earliest days of the settle-
ment this gong was suspended at a high spot
in the district —still known as Bell Post Hill
—and was vigorously sounded as a warning
every time hostile-looking aborigines put in
an appearance. There was only a handful
of whites at Geelong then, and they needed
■all the warning they could get. I have been
told.that the manipulator of the bell, after
singing out “Saw yer,” would do a Donaldson
sprint for his own safety. But I have never
been able to find out why the blacks did not
settle the whole thing by collaring the bell.
If poor, old, rabbit-haunted
Cantberra is never remark-
able for anything else, it will
be remembered to its credit
in the days to come that it
was once a centre of the fur
industry. It seems that the
accursed rabbit’s upholstery,
after skilful treatment by
expert fur-fakers, is sold
freely as sable, several
brands of seal and chin-
chilla. In view of the rab-
bit’s commercial importance,
G.-G. Denman, while loiter-
ing round after the founda-
tion-stoning of the alleged
capital, might reasonably,
therefore, have accepted a
chance photographer’s prof-
fered gift of the pair of live
young Federal rabbits he had
fallen over. Cantberra will
be the only capital city in
the world that stands to lose
substantially by an increase
of population, and noise and
bustle. So long as it is de-
serted and quiet, Prosperity
will rush round it and in-
crease and multiply in its
burrow. But when people
begin to flock there, Pros-
perity will scurry from it with its ears laid
back and a flick of its brief white tail; and
the three men and a boy to whom the fruit-
ful territory gave employment will have to
move on.
A matter of menus and millinery :■ —
From the officers who were in camp the other
week comes the complaint that they could not live
on their allowance. Let us consider this matter in
cold blood. The men who shoulder the rifles are ex-
pected to be in good fighting trim on an allowance
of Is. 3d. per diem. The officers from whom the
complaint comes are allowed on an average 6s. 3d.
per day. Here is the trouble. Many citizen-officers
are used to high living, and they believe in indulg-
ing themselves even in camp. Under the mess sys-
tem the expense is pooled, and the man who wants
to live rationally is rooked to help support the
others. Our army should be run on a business basis ;
and as the officers seem unable to manage on a fair
thing, other arrangements should be made. The
Government has issued, a menu for Schools of In-
struction, and also pays the bill. By this system
the officer has nothing to pay, the food is of the re-
quired standard, and all concerned receive a fair deal.
Why doesn’t the Department apply this system to
camps of annual training?
Another point sticks out of the officers’ clothes.
In England rankers promoted to commissions now re-
ceive £l5O outfit allowance; and the rank of 2nd
Lieutenant has been abolished. Many rankers have
been promoted to commission in Australia ; but they
received no outfit allowance, being expected to pro-
cure the costly uniform (most of it for show nur-
poses) as best they could. Recently, moreover,'the
Labor Government adopted the rank of 2nd Lieuten-
ant, and by so doing effected a saving of £5O per
new officer per year. We adopt from the British
army the cheap things; we reject those which are of
advantage to the personnel. For example, in Eng-
land a major retires at 55 on half pay; in Australia
he retires at 55 on no pay at all.
The Bulletin’s Religious Editor observes
with profound concern that in the State of
Ohio, U.S.A., an effort is being made to fix
a compulsory minimum size for buttons ; they
must not be smaller than a silver dollar. If
this measure becomes law, it will be neces-
sary to take up church collections in a wash-
tub in Ohio.
THE IGNORANCE
THAT IS BLISS.
“Of course I worry when he's out late and I
don't know where he is."
“My dear, he thankful you don't know. You'd
worry a lot more if you did."
What is calculated to be a steadier to the
assaulting classes was dealt out by Chief
Justice Cullen at the Criminal Court, sit-
ting at Sydney last week, when a 20-year-
old youth was sent on for five years’ hard
labor. Whether it is due to the increased
cost of living, or political despair, the
assaulting classes in Sydney have certainly
been restive for some time. Indeed, the
halcyon days of “the push” seem on the
verge of a revival. The fashions, however,
are changing. The “boot” is no longer the
popular method of dealing it out. To-day,
the loaded bottle is the means of the happy
despatch, although in a push scramble in
mid-city recently a man was “done in”
with a knife, and in the case of the youth
above-mentioned the argument was con-
ducted with an axe. The right-thinking
members of the assaulting classes, however,
deprecate such barbarous methods. With a
bottle of beer in each pocket, they keep the
caste of the darkened rialto, and the citizen
who gets a crack with the instrument is
unlikely to be ot further benefit to his family.
Certainly, it means the lo§s of the beer, but
a bloke can’t have everything.
“Celeh”: Darwin is a
straggling untidy, unfin-
ished place; and this is
most of the reason why. A
few decades ago a sort of
lottery was conducted , in
England for the disposal of
Northern Territory land. A
vas't number of 320-acfe
blocks were offered, and as
a special allurement a i-acre
town allotment in Darwin
was thrown in free with each
block. The price of . the
country land wf« 7s. 6d. per
acre. Lords and dukes and
more useful fish snapped at
the bait and stumped up
each his £l2O. Of course,
the old sharks did nothing
with their new estates ; and
it isn’t on record that so
much as one duke built a
humpy on his town allot-
ment. But most of them still
hang on to the hook, which
is one reason why in the
topmost places in dear old Hingland you can
still hear somebody maunder about the great
potentialities of Dahwin— nearest point to
the East —great military base—natural heri-
tage—but infamous Government, sir, in-
famous !

Ernest Godfree, a young Australian elec-
trical engineer gnawed by the worm of in-
vention, is making some progress in his
efforts to persuade the telephone people to
take up an automatic recorder. The inven-
tion is amazingly ingenious, and its claims
to adoption appeal both to the department
that charges for calls and to the subscribers
that complain of being charged for far too
many. The recorder registers only the calls
that are effective', and, as it is automatic,
Godfree claims that it saves times and worry
in the operating room, besides assuring a fair
deal to the subscribers. The device has been
tested by those who know, and, moreover, has
recorded thousands of calls without error.
Godfree has other electrical inventions on
hand, but he thinks this one so badly wanted
that he has formed himself into a proprietary
co. in Melbourne to push it.

From London :
An exhibition of statues and plaster models by
the late Thomas Woolner is attracting interest in
this Arcadian village. His Captain Cook, erected in
Hyde Park, Sydney, is here in plaster, and looks his
best work. Woolner really got that job because he
had spent a couple of years in Australia in the
’so’s, not as a sculptor, but as a gold-digger. He
didn’t make tucker, so he went back to his studio.
While in Australia he wrote some poems; they are
not of much literary account, but are nevertheless
included in a small volume of his collected verses.
Woolner sculped Gladstone, Cobden, Carlyle and
various other English celebrities, and Parkes once
gave him an order to get to work on a number
of Australian statesmen. But Woolner smelt trouble,
and the commission was never executed.

You are expected to rock with laughter
when you read this cable :
London, Saturday.—The ancient Easter benefae
tion and ceremony took place yesterday in the
churchyard of St. Bartholomew, West Smithfield
New sixpenny pieces and hot-cross buns were distri'
buted amongst 22 aged London widows. The con
dition of their receiving the money and buns was
that they must climb over the churchyard wall and
pick up the sixpences as they dropped on an old flat
tombstone. The oldest recipient of the benefaction
was 94 years old.
What! Not laugh at the idea of somebody’s
decrepit old grandmother trying to climb over
a wall into a graveyard to get a bun and
sixpence! Not laugh when the old lady slips
back and bruises her poor shrunk shanks'
Ah, but you will laugh at the brilliant jest
which makes your mother’s mother grope for
the coin on a tombstone!
* * * *
A combination of burglar scare and hot-
cross confectionery brought a Victorian
baker to a hospital on Good Friday. The
vicious public habit of devouring more or
less sodden buns on this particular morning
compelled the baker to deliver them at an
uncivilised hour, and as he didn’t want to
arouse the neighborhood he stepped into his
customers’ back yards and left the ammuni-
tion on the doorsten. Unfortunately, one
householder was a light sleeper, and, mis-
taking the baker for a burglar, swiftly
opened the door and hit him on the head
good and hard. His subsequent apologies
somewhat soothed the victim’s lacerated
feelings but had no effect on the wound it-
self. Nothing would do for that except hos-
pital treatment.
* * * *
W. G.- Todd, the chief panjandrum of the
Sydney Ferries, a few hours before his co.
threw in the towel, declared that the strik-
ers’ demands meant an increase of £30,000
in the annual working expenses. He said it
triumphantly, as though it was a decisive
argument. Yet it was nothing of the sort.
If the conditions under which the amount
had so far been saved to the co. were iniqui-
tous and against public conscience, then it
was merely an admission that the co. had,
by guile or force, deprived the ferry hands
of £30,000 per annum in wages to which
those men were morelly entitled. There are
a lot of cases that ought to be turned bottom-
side up before inspection, and this was one
of them.
THE LATEST EPIDEMIC.
A total eclipse of the moon took place on March
22 between' 8.15 and 11 p.m.
TOMMY: “Oh, Pa! Look, there's a gas strike
in Heaven!"
“B.” : Sydney’s big Show having . shut
down for a twelvemonth, Secretary Somer
should study out how to do some things
better next time. For instance, the charges
for tucker are altogether out of proportion
to the goods supplied. The Show committee
sets the stands up to auction, and, presum-
ably, passes them over to the highest bid-
ders, who are left free to work their own
sweet will on outback Jimmy. Luncheons
and dinners worth in the city 6d. or 9d. are
followed by a demand for Is. or 2s. A lone
man may do without, but bashful Jimmy
must give his girl something to eat, and
that’s the booth-keeper’s chance. The com-
mittee which takes the price of the booth
should obtain samples of the goods to be
offered, with prices attached, and have some-
one to see that goods are up to sample.
THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD.
MRS. DE STVLE : “ Yes; and do you know Willie has been made a lieutenant at £2OO
’a year? Isn't it splendid? ”
MRS. GREVSEER : “Is THAT all? Why, my boy Sam cleared £1800 last year
growing pigs!"
The procedure before the N.S.W. tortoise-
likej Wages Boards is bad enough under the
best of current conditions, but the intrusion
of ,‘police-court methods threatens to make it
wofse. The case 6f the actors is the last to
hit the eye in this way. The question before
the Court is whether the Actors’ Union
should be allowed to register, and questions
as to whether members have been in gaol,
pirated plays; or worked for lid. per week
with board and lodging have nothing to do
wifh the casq. Some of them may have got
into gaol. because greedy theatrical firms
paid them sUcL-,wretched wages. Anyhow,
the questidh! 'of registration is one which
affects every member of the union, and if 10
p.c. of the members have been where better
men have been before them, that is no
reison why the other 90 p.c. should not get
their registration. If the legal mercenaries
in these matters cannot be induced to leave
their professional/mud in their offices, then
the Act should be amended, and the legal
mercenaries should be, totally excluded from
the proceedings—from membership of the
Boards included. In fact, it looks very much
as though the legal mercenary should be ex-
cluded from membership of the Boards in
any case.

The inquest on the victim of \ ictoria’s
latest level-q Tossing smash revealed that, on
Down South railways, gatekeepers receive
no warning ’from the nearest signal station
of the approach of trains. The gatekeeper
has a time-table and a clock, and that is all
he has to go on. Naturally, under these
circumstances, fatalities on Victorian level-
crossings are frequent. In this latest
case the keeper, with three minutes to spare,
allowed traffic to go through. The train ap-
parently was a trifle ahead of time, or the
clock was a trifle behind time, and the re-
sult was smash. Moreover, this particular
gate was of a type which was old when the
first Babylonian railway ran out to Nimi-
tabel; the gatekeeper has to push it open
and push it“ shut, instead of having control
of it with a lever. Consequently, since he
happened to be on the north side, he had no
means of closing the gate on the south side,
where the loaded drag got in on to the rails.
If decent appliances had been in use the
southern gate could have been snapped-to,
and there wouldn’t have been a corpse and
a wasted citizen on the national premises.
“0.K.” on various rooks :
The arrest of two men in a northern town on a charge
of conspiring to win another man's money at cards, re-
vives tire question whether the Law ought to let
itself be dragged into a private gambling transaction,
h our men play cards at a reputable hotel, and one
of them, after losing it 1800, practically applies to
the Law to cancel the 10 U’s he gave to two of
the winners by getting them convicted of fraudulent
play. Seeing that the Law cannot be used to enforce
the payment of losses at card-playing, it has no
visible right to invalidate any 1O U s which are
received as winnings. In short, it has no visible
right to interfere in matters of gambling “debts of
honor” contracted under social conditions at a private
card-table. It is entitled to suppress gambling
“hells” —high-toned or low-toned —where fools and
their money are parted under unlawful conditions;
and it may deal with a licensed victualler who per-
mits gambling to be practised in a regular way at
his house. But, seemingly, it has no such power
over a racecourse where bookmakers and jockeys
conspire to rob punters (including the owner and
trainer in some cases) of their fair chance to win
bets on certain horses. If the Law gives no redress
to the defrauded parties in such gambling transac-
tions, and if it can do nothing to the pedestrian,
boxer or oarsman who conspires with accomplices to
take down his backer, how comes it to be empowered
to punish alleged card-sharpers? Card-sharping is not
a more provable swindle than other forms of crook-
ness in gambling ; and even were it so, a trustful
gambler, with the “broads” has less claim to the
Law’s sympathy and protection than the gambler in
a legalised sport, which is more or less deserving of
national encouragement as a sport. Gambling at
cards is not sport. Even the racecourse has virtues
as well as vices, whereas the cardroom devoted to
gambling is wholly vicious. Hence the law for the
suppression of “hells” and the prohibition of syste-
matic gambling in the parlors of licensed houses.
The individual card gambler, engaged in wholly
vicious dissipation, seems, therefore, quite unworthy
of the Law’s aid in recovering losses incidental to
the game, no matter how they may have been in-
curred, seeing that no such aid is available to the
swindled racecourse punter, save in the rare instances
where a welsher bolts with a winning punter’s cash
deposit. The arrest of two or three poker players
for winning £lBOO from an English Juggins at a
fashionable Brisbane hostelry strikes me, therefore,
as being an illogical business.
A recent incident at the Melbourne head-
quarters of the W.P.A. afforded a “Mile-
stones” contrast between the worldly-wise
modern woman and the guileless matron of
an elderly generation. Vida Goldstein was
earnestly orating on the White Slave traffic
and its bearings on the Commonwealth.
Legislation in England, according to the em-
phatic Vida, begins to press hard upon the
victims of the traffic, with the result that
they are taking to emigration, and are
selecting Australia as their dumping-ground.
When the candidate for Parliament had fully
discussed the danger that threatens social
life from an inrush of foreign members of
Mrs. Warren’s profession, an elderly matron
of importance arose and said : “I fully agree
with everything Miss Goldstein has said
about the treatment of White Slaves. It is
dreadful to think they should be doing white-
work for 6s. and 7s. a week.” The good old
soul’s notion of the traffic in question was
inextricably mixed up with undergarment
factories.
“R.D.” : I have never been to Tonga, and
don’t want to go now. I did have a yearn-
ing for a trip round the islands of the
Pacific, and mild flirtations with dusky
maids, but that is all over. A statistical re-
turn furnished at the recent Methodist Con-
ference in Sydney disillusioned me ; it claimed
for little Tonga 21 Methodist ministers, 15
catechists, 413 local preachers and 528 class
leaders, making a total of 1177 spreaders of
the Gospel. As I suppose the Methodists
haven’t got the pilotage all to themselves,
Tonga is no place for me—not, anyway, till
Time decorates me with white whiskers and
other perpetual reminders of my latter end.
Upwards of a month ago the secretary of
the “Citizens’ Committee,” formed to resist
the taking over of Federal Government
House (Sydney) by the McGowen Admini-
stration, assured the papers that the cash to
fight that action had been subscribed “by all
sections of the community.” At the same
time he and his colleagues warily refrained
from publishing a balance-sheet or any list
of those who had weighed in with the money.
This paper promptly submitted (1) that
there was little coin in hand, and (2) that
such as there was had come from a very
small section. It spoke from long and pain-
ful experience of the indigenous “loyalist.”
This type, except when drunk, likes to get
his patriotic sensationalism on the cheap.
There must be thousands of men of means
who, months ago, denounced the resumption
of Government House as “an insult to his
Majesty the King,” and “a gross indignity
to the Mother Country,” and who reiterate
those well-worn gags still when the subject
comes up. If they had at any time trans-
lated their splendid sentiments into terms of
guineas—or, for that matter, mere shillings
—the fund would be in a bulging state to-‘
day. But, of course, they didn’t. The fund
is apparently “broke,” wherefore the follow-
ing wild cry for help came from William
McLinen last week :
Up to the present all the expenses have fallen
upon a few, and the committee now appeals to the
public at large for subscriptions to carry on the
fight to the last ditch. We now look to all who
have sympathised with our unceasing efforts during
the last six months to show their practical appre-
ciation by subscribing liberally to our funds.
In fact, things are as this paper
suspected, and the committeeman who
implied that there had been a frantic
rush on the part of wharf-laborers,
bank managers, scullery majds, million-
aires, pub-loafers and remittance-men,
may be said to have toyed with veracity.
Anyhow, if he didn’t toy with it then, Syd-
ney’s knightly linen-draoer did last week.
In affairs like this it 'is seemly for the
parties to ever bear in mind Lord Mel-
bourne’s classic counsel to his fellow-Mini-
sters: “It doesn’t matter a curse what we
say; but, for God’s sake, let us all say the
same thing.”

THE BANQUET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I took me to a banquet-place
The other night, where eager men
With hungry eyes sat through the grace,
Where havoc ruled it for a space
And knives plied furiously ; and then
A public man of aspect meek
In measured terms began to speak
Each guest sat limply in his chair.
As one might on a storm-tossed deck,
And gazed as one obsessed by care.
I felt the canker of despair
Among the feast’s confounded wreck.
The speaker no compassion balked—
He talked, and talked, and talked, and tamed !
The waiters, dumb against the wall,
, Were ranged like mutes who wait on death.
A dreadful'grief encompassed all.
I heard the sighing rise and; fall,
Woe clamorous in every breath,
And felt what meaning dfre is stored
In that grim phrase, “The groaning bored.”

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Snell” : It isn’t always the cow farmer.
Sometimes it is the agriculturist devoted to onions,
and on occasion it is the squatter whose speciality is
poultry. This time it is the landed gent: who goes
in for hen culture. His name was Broome, and he
was before the Court charged with grievously as-
saulting his wife with divers lethal instruments —
to wit, one boot, one picket, and one hoe. Broome
seemed to have no defence. He was very sullen,
but could bring nothing against his wife. On his
own admission she was a good enough wife, kind t 6
chickens, and an indefatigable toiler. He admitted
the kicks, also the knock with the hoe; he was not
certain about hitting her with the picket, but con-
fessed the possibility. Tbe chairman of the Bench
was very indignant with Broome. He read the man
one of the severest lectures that had ever been heard
in court at Tinbilly. Broome bore it well for four
minutes; then he turned on the magistrate, shaking
a fist like a smoked leg of mutton, and bellowed:
“It’s all damn fine for you to talk, Jupp; but I’d
like to see you with 180 hens, eggs two bob a dozen,
and on’y ten layin’!”
FALLEN AWAY.
“ It's terrible to see him so often helpless with
drink like this. And I believe he was a
good man once?”
“A good man! My word, he was. I've seen
the time he could stand up to the bar all
day; now it only takes a couple of beers to
out him.”
“Fitztight”: Apropos of the uses to which
lawyer-vine is put by Binghi. The Papuans find
many uses for the same vine, which is also called
minah. With it they construct suspension bridges
up to 180 ft. in length, across many of the rushing
streams of the Territory. These bridges are very
strong, and will bear the weight of 10 or 12 persons
crossing at one time.' Generally they last for six
months, when the strands are renewed. In con
structjng their houses, many of which are up to
120ft.‘in length, and are built to last a generation
or two, the Papuans use minah instead of nails
where anv fastening has to be done. Of course, such
fastenings will only last for about two years or
when they are renewed. Lawyer-vine is a 8
by the natives of the Territory for . hauling
the logs used in making dug-out canoes, an< ?
secure the decking to canoes, and for ngging e
sails. As to its strength, I have seen about ,300
natives haul a stranded steam launch, weighing
about 60 tons, up on the baach near Motu-motu with
a long vine about thick.
\\ al : On the north-east coast of
British Papua the natives go in largely for betel
chewing, and just as the Australian woman invites
her friends to afternoon tea when she wishes to
show friendship, so the dusky matron of Papua
invites her acquaintances to call and have a chew
n i Al . so ’ a man wis hes to inform his
beloved of his amorous longings towards her, he
asks her to chew betel with him—the equivalent of
an offer cf marriage. In war the custom is also
observed, the warriors chewing the nut before the
attack to gain courage and strength. In peace it
is used to cement friendship. To show honor to '
a visitor the host will go so far as to offer his
own , wad of much-bechewed horribleness for his
guest s consumption. I have been a sufferer my-
self of this “honor,” and I know. If the guest
survives he automatically exchanges names with
his host—my own name is now worn by a greasy
old man up in Collingwood Bay (Papua).
* * * *
“Leichhardt”: I can substantiate “Te
Babarantiko’s” remarks about clams having trapped
niggers. In Whitsunday Passage (Q.) a nigger step-
ped into an open shell. The clam banged the door,
and what was left, of Binghi was found a few days
later at low water. The foot and ankle were still
firmly held by the bivalve. By the way, many clams
are choked by coral. The fish take up residence on
a boulder. The coral builds all round the shell, and
finally prevents the valves opening at all. On the
Barrier Reef I have watched this process of suffo-
cation—have found shells which would open only a
fraction of an inch. When the fish is in good
form it is impossible to force the shell apart once
it has closed. I tried on one with an inch pinch-bar,
but the best I could do was to burst the shell in the
vicinity of the bar itself.
* * * *
“Gouger’s” snort of indignation:—
Shocking havoc is being played up North
amongst the blacks by the bestial Chow, and the
people who keep the most silent on the subject are
those Gospel-traders who are quickest to splurge
against a white njan if he even looks sideways at
a black. All through Northern Queensland it is
well known that black sister visits yellow brother
in multitudes, much to the joy of Binghi, who, as
his share of the transaction, gets a pittance of
opium charcoal. When the tribe has thus come
by sufficient charcoal (as also leprosy and other
diseases too numerous and disgusting to mention
in cold print), the goods are wrapped tightly in a
rag, and soaked in a kerosene tin of water until the
liquid is discolored. The tribe then sits around and
drinks this poison ; then, gins and all, they smoke
the dried opium dust until there is absolutely no-
thing left. In two years time there is also about
nothing left of the crowd. I will give you a case
I witnessed but a few months ago, and similar
cases are known plentifully to every bushman in
the North of Queensland. Twelve months back five
strapping boys left the Bloomfield River, and
worked on a clearing which some Chows were
making for a garden near Mount Molloy. When
their 12 months’ engagement was over they re-
turned to the tribe with most of their wages re-
presented by tins full of smoked-out opium. The
second day after their arrival there were 30 boys
on a nice shady beach of the river, and they were
smoking the charcoal in two long bamboo pipes
copied from the Chinese. Six weeks afterwards the
original five boys died, all within a fortnight.
This' case is known well on the Bloomfield, the
tragedy having been the more conspicuous because
the boys were the pick of their tribe as regards
physique.
* * * *
“Gil”: I am painfully puzzled. That is
to say I am a bit more painfully puzzled than
usual. And the cause of my bewilder-
ment is this: While taking a constitu-
tional along Glenelg (Adelaide) beach
the other morning, I suddenly beheld a
lady* emulating La Milo, or the Naked
Truth, or something like that. She had
just emerged from the surf, and was
nonchalantly wiping the wet sea off her
nakedness. Admittedly, she was in one
of the dressing-sheds; but as these
amazing edifices are open on all sides,
privacy therein is a delusion and a snare..
Many people were passing quite close to
La Milo—but she still continued to
separate herself from the damp embraces
of the sea. Now, what I want to know
is: (1) Did she think that the roof over
her head protected her from the eyes of
a Shocked but admiring community ?
(2) Was she the cause of Adelaide’s
wave of Wowserism, or merely the effect
of it? (3) Was she proud of her pro-
portions, and anxious for everybody else
to be likewise? P.S. —She certainly
possessed a fine figure. At least, I was
told so by a staid old gentleman with
side-whiskers and a prayer-book, who
assured me that he quite accidentally
beheld the Scandal while he was look-
ing the other way.
“Konini” : They were a dour lot, the old
Scotch settlers in the early days of Dunedin (M.L.).
AS I write, there lies in front of me a local news-
paper of ’59 containing news of the arrival of the
Ship Avondale. A bookseller advertises his consign-
ment of reading by the vessel consisting of: —
Reference Pocket Bibles and Psalm Books.
Pulpit Bibles.
Prayer Books and Church Services.
Psalms, Hvmns and Harmonies.
Watts’s Divine Songs and Olney Hymns.
Untearable Toy Books.
Proof Catechisms and School Books.
Together with a great variety of new and recently-
published works.
But times have greatly changed in Otago. Last time
I was there I visited an old home where, as a small
bov, I was once reprimanded for whistling on the
Sawbath. There wasf only one bdok on the Ifttle old
round table (same table) in the parlor. It was
“Life’s Shop Winflow,” by that blushful authoress,
“Victoria Cross.”
* * *
“Wal”: On the subject of disappearing
streams, I would butt in with the remark that some
Papuan rivers are champions at the art of vanish-
ing. When Staniforth Smith was lost in the country
around the Kiko River, Papua, the relief expedition
discovered many weird and uncanny phenomena.
Creeks were detected rushing out of the ground, and
on being followed they dived underground, only to
well forth again presently. Camped at night on ap-
parently solid rock, the party more than once heard
the rumble of waters right under them, and < great
was the fear the native earners had of this devil s
country,” as they termed it. On one occasion the
party halted for the midday rest on the bank of a
large water.hole, into which the sweating natives
soon dropped for a bath, only to find the water
rapidly disappear and leave them standing on the
coral, scared and shivering.
BEMINNS 1912
SETTING THE FASHION.
MARY: “Aline t'inkit white Mary been copyin' me alonga eye!"
“Yam”: Answering “Leo Lear’s” ques-
tion I can say without fracturing the truth that the
first seeds of strawberry clover were stowaways in
some packing material which came from France, and
no assisted immigrant has ever done better on the
Tarwin Meadows in Gippsland. I saw it there in
1896, and afterwards learned from the owner of the
Meadows (Murray Black) that his father, who pion-
eered that part, found some plants, about 1880,
which he traced to the packing material from France.
Later, he got more of the seed from that country.
It does not germinate readily unless it has run the
course of a beast’s digestion, and the usual method
of propagation is by planting roots or runners. One
of its virtues is that in swampy land of a saline
character it kills out rushes and tussocks in good
time. Another is that Melbourne butchers give extra
cash for bullocks off its residence. Also, I have
known cows to give as much milk in autumn,
through being fed on this clover, as similar cows on
the best hill country did in springtime. The vege-
table prefers the breath of the sea, but I have seen
it growing well, 60 miles inland, at the back of
Budgeree.

“Surveyor”: “Pick” (B. 27/2/’l3) asks
for reliable information concerning the genuine
performances of the latter-day black tracker. He
says in the days when Ned Kelly and his gang made
things hum in the N.E. of Victoria, the trackers
made good by tracking across “acres of bare rock’’;
since then he has “doots.” I have just returned
from the Kelly country, and can vouch for the fol-
lowing performance, which I closely followed from
the distance of a few yards. I was in the little
village of Eskdale, on the Mitta Mitta River, which
lies about 86 miles south from Tallangatta; and as
a result of numerous crimes committed in the local-
ity—shooting, cattle stealing and incendiarism—
two trackers were sent along. They were Cooktown
blacks, tall and spindle-shanked, and they started
work on an arson job. Many footprints were about,
and it appeared hopeless to pick up the required
tracks ; but the blacks were on a trail 15 minutes
from the start, and followed it through the scrub,
head about 2ft. from the ground, and one on each
side of trail. For about 200 vards it was scrub ; then
a maize patch, a grass paddock (100 yards), along
a creek and across a fence. Eventually they trailed
up to a hut where a man was walking up and down,
scowling at the approaching procession. A de-
tective entered the hut, and emerged in a few
minutes with a pair of odd boots, which (it is
alleged) completely fitted the aforesaid tracks. The
scowling man was lodged in the Mitta logs that
night. I may state that in charge of these trackers
was Inspector Fawkiner, the identical man who had
charge of the Kelly gang trackers. He wears well,
and is as genial a “cop” as you could wish not to
meet. Dan Kelly said that if the Gang caught the
trackers he would “roast them alive —sure.” No
doubt he would have done it, too. He was an angry
person. My impression of the tracking I write
about is that it was a thoroughly good bit of work.
The Government pays each nig £1 per week and
keep, on a five years’ engagement, on the termina-
tion of which he is to be returned to Cooktown.
“A.L.8.”: I can assure “Gouger” (B.
13/3/’l3) that snake-bites do affect pigs. I once
was intimately acquainted with a pig that died
three hours after it had stood on the corns of a
death-adder. The funeral happened in 1910. And
I have seen the wild N. Queensland pig develop de-
lirium tremens at sight of any old snake. The same
applies to his brother out beyond Thargomindali
(Queensland). Pigs are hard to kill generally, never-
theless. Years ago I helped to assassinate an old
barrow on a Hunter River (N.S.W.) farm. The
cocky had no lead to make bullets with for his shot-
gun, so he used my marbles. That’s why I remem-
ber. The first four marbles penetrated the skin of
the pig’s forehead, and stuck. Then the pig turned
the other side of his forehead round, curse him! and
I lost a lot more marbles before the cocky thought
that it would, • perhaps, pay him better to splinter
his axe than to ride to Cessnock for more marbles.
Curse the pig again!- I had to turn a grindstone
while all the coekies in the district sharpened the
axes that had helped in the slaughter. [And
yet one of the earliest recollections of this
particular sub-editor is of having shied an empty
penny earthenware ink-bottle at a large porker, and
of having thereby, without intent, killed the beast
almost instantaneously.]

DROUGHT-RESISTING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tobacco is largely drought-resisting.
—Maoriland expert.
I am intent upon a semi-Wowse.
No longer shall I seek the. wild, wet ways
Where some bind beer-leaves on their heated brows
And the ripe whisky on the low bough sways.
The juniper for me unpressed shall stay,
The grape’s led blood is from my dreams cast
out,
If only this be truthful that they say
Who hold tobacco will resist a drought.
Arise, blue clouds, between me and the sun—
The sun that flames upon my thirst's desire—
Shadow me over till the day is done,
And veil me thickly from the evening’s fire.
Lo, friendship comes with speech of thirsty joy,
The silver coins within my pocket flame,
But" with a loaded pipe I shall destroy
The stinging lure that leads me into blame.
Rise, soft curled clouds of incense, to the roof,
And hover round me in temptation’s hour;
Beset by cheap cigars I shall be proof
Against the most enticing bottle’s power.
Spread the new gospel where the Wowsers wowse,
And shed for lonely Bung a bitter tear;
The wreath of smoke about a people’s brows
May keep it holy and aloof from beer.
When hot winds come to waste my spirit grey
I shall not instantly arise and shout,
But test the truth of what the experts say
Who hold tobacco will resist a drought.

“Wal” : Much of this yabber about the
dying-out of the native peoples of the South Seas
and New Guinea makes me tired. Take the situa-
tion in Papua. Before the white man came the
country was given over to incessant warfare. The
innumerable tribes and families all had their blood
feuds and vendettas; and promiscuous killing was the
rule rather than the exception. When the white
man’s government came along, the first thing done
was to declare a close season for man ; and after
the rifles had talked some few times to erring tribes-
men, it became known' that the pursuit of your bro-
ther with a club was a most unhealthy occupa-
tion for both hunter and quarry. Thus came a period
of peace and a consequent rise in the birth rate. But
things were not for the better; for nothing was given
the tamed warriors to keep them occupied, and a
policy of drift arrived. In the old (and wicked)
days, when to keep alive a man had to be ever ready
with club and spear, the physical side of him was
always in form; but with the advent of peace, with
nothing to worry about, he became slack; and now,
after years of idleness, he shows signs of degeneracy.
The missionary has not improved matters. It is a
fact well known in colored countries that once a
native comes under the influence of alleged Christian
missionaries he degenerates into a mean, lying appar-
ition of his former self. Why this is so I cannot
say, but the fact remains that it is; and wherever
one goes it will be found that those villages where
missionary influence is strong are in nearly every
case the most degenerate and with the lowest birth
rate. It may be that one reason is the fact that the
missionary tries too quickly to change the man of
the Stone Age into the clothes-wearing and artificial
being of the present day. When the experiment
proves a failure, he raises the cry that the poor
native is being exterminated by the white man, and
even goes so far as to state that most of the mor-
tality is due to the Red Plague brought into the
country by the Caucasian, though the unmentionable
disease was known in the country long before the
first foreigner arrived, and even had a name in most
of the tribal languages. No! The real reason for
the decrease in population in many of the islands is
idleness. One has only to go into those villages
where the majority of the people are industrious to
see the other side of the picture. Every house has
children, swarms of them play about the paths and
roll in the warm water along the beaches, and all
appear contented and healthy. But of the men in
such places you will hardly see one, for they are
away copra-making in the cocoanut groves along the
beach and up the rivers, whilst their wives are at
the gardens, or crabbing and fishing the numerous
creeks close by. Perhaps some dozens of the youths
are indentured on the plantations, where they have
to work hard, but are well fed, returning to their
after their term of service is expired, benefited
both mentally and physically by the regular work and
discipline. That they like this work is proved by
the numbers who return again and again to the same
employers; and that they are well treated by the
employers the very fact of their re-engaging is proof
sufficient. There is only one solution of the problem
of the decrease in population of the Islands and parts
of Papua, and that is summed up in one word—
work. Make them industrious, give them something
to take the place of war, and the question will settle
itself. No people can live without work; Rome,
Carthage and Babylon all crumbled into dust when
the people ceased to exert themselves; and what was
their downfall is being the downfall of the colored
peoples in the Pacific to-day. Again I would say:
If you want to save a valuable people from extinc-
tion, don’t send them missionaries of the Gospel, but
send missionaries of Graft.
FASHIONS IN FUR. —THE LION-

“P.H.”: How is this for an Australian
record? George Ridley and Paul Kasch, well-
sinkers, now working together at Mordialloc (Vic.),
claim to have sunk 620 wells in the district embra-
cing Caulfield, Oakleigh, Aspendale, Dandenong,
Spring Vale, Berwick, etc. Before joining Paul,
George had sunk 320 wells with successive mates,
and Paul had put down 300. The wells are from
about 15 to about 75 feet deep. Most of them are
round, and lined with bricks, and water was got in
every one of them. Paul has never had any sort of
accident, and George has never had one of much con-
sequence.
READY TO MEET HIM.
WOWSER : “Ah, my friend, you are serving the Devil."
BARMAN (affably): “Yes, sir; what'll you have?"
“Tea Tree Bill”: This is what’s happen-
ing to me. A hive of bees recently shifted camp to
the side of my bedroom between the lining and the
wall, and presently broke through the hessian into
the room, where they caught me between bath-robe
and trousers-time. I’ve tried to smoke them out,
but although I reckon 35,462 are dead, there are
still 166,385 cannibals sitting round on every point
of vantage in my room curling their whiskers and
sharpening their back cutlasses for me. I’ve ob-
served them through the window, and a joyous
smile of anticipation has lit up every face. But I’m
not going in. I don’t reckon it’s my move—any-
how, until I’m dead sure of the move. Anybody
got a spare move about him ?

“Silas” : We have just heard why Selina
left home. It is four
years since she forsook the
parental roof, and now that
the explanation is forthcom-
ing nobody is satisfied with
it but me. I hate rabbits
too. Selina was pretty, and
still is. She went to work
at Gumm and Rustle’s one
morning, put in her eight
hours as usual, and departed
for home, where she never
arrived. There was talk of
an encounter with a dashing
cavalier by- the way. We
know now that she went to
Europe with him. After
four years Selina and her
anguished parents met again.
“Why, oh why, didn’t you
come home that night?”
asked the tear-stained,
mother. “I don’t know,”
Selina replied thoughtfully.
“I believe it was really be-
cause there was stewed rab-
bit for tea.” ■
“Wal”: So a bloque named “Sluice Box”
(B. 20/2/’l3) has questioned my veracity in giving
out the weight of a stone pestle found on the Lake-
kamu goldfield (Papua). “Sluice Box” evidently
knows of only one of the three stone pestles un-
earthed in his far-away region; and that’s how he
falls in. Since he has tried to correct me over the
former implement, I will return the compliment
with regard to his statement that “the natives of
the Lakekamu district never use clubs of any de-
scription.” The people, whom he incorrectly calls
Kukukuku, but whose rightful title is larima, do
use stone clubs. Anyway, I have seen several speci-
mens that were obtained by miners on the Tiveri
River, above Tail End, and the native Papuan hasn’t
developed the civilised habit of getting things he
has no use for.
“Gouger’s” plain tale from the hills:—
It was a cold, dark night that we lay in camp
in the Almaden (Q.) country, at the foot of a small
ridge. I was dreaming that my pillow of sweaty
saddle was a cushion of silk and down, when my
mate clenched my wrist. I awoke amid a volley of
screams, which seemed to come from the other side
of the ridge. “Gorstruth,” said Bill, “somebody’s
bein’ done in.” Hastily he jerked cartridges into
the rifle, while I grabbed the axe, and we started
up the gully. At the top we peered through the
dim light, and saw a ghostly tent on the flat, with
something like a bundle of rags clinging to the
top of the pole. A long-drawn-out howl reached us,
and the sound as of an animal falling from a fruitless
spring. We ran forward, and saw a pack of dingoes
round the foot of the tent pole. The canvas was
torn to shreds, and a hatter clung desperately in
mid-air. As we ran, Bill fired twice and two dogs
fell. The rest vanished. Then we lowered the old
cove and listened to his story. “They’re the only
thing in the bush I’m afeared of,” he gasped.
“First they only came about after dark then
they got gamer... .would be at the camp at sun-
down.... watch me boiling the bi11y.... always com-

They was jumping, trying to reach me when you

week, and what’s left of that pack would be hard to
find and worse to skin.

“Hee Ivee”: That much-untravelled body,
the Royal Geographical Society, is* leaving the deep
impression of its ridiculous hoof on W.A.’s place
names. Recently it issued an edict, and, as a re-
sult, Gnowangerup has been altered to Ngowanger-
up, Wyalcatchem to Wyalkatchem, Quelcan to
Ilwelcan, and (hold your breath) Yelbene to Yel-
b6ni. Fancy trying to explain to Binghi the subtle
difference between accent acute and circumflex 1
Even the mining hamlet has come in for attention,
and the mere bloque or collection of bloques who
christened their camp “You an’ Me” have been in-
formed that the correct nomenclature is “Youanmi ”
It is comforting to note, however, that there are
still a few clusters of bag-and-bark boroughs which
defy the Society, such as Slippery Gimlet, Wilson’s
Patch, Twelve b’ Ten, and Linger and Die. No
mere ornamental society can alter Linger and Die.
Its a classic.
“Wal” : The statement made by “p an . la „
Boy" (B. 27/2/T3), re the toughness of cassoS
flesh, is hardly correct, unless he tried to masti™7
a grandfather fowl. On the Lakekamu goldfield **
portion of Papua famous for the numbers of th
bird, the miners consider young cassowary a m
excellent meat, and great is their joy when th
“shooting boy” brings in a plump one. Unlike mn t
fowls, the cassowary is not the possessor of a flesh
breast, most of the meat being on the legs - and™ 5,
the birds are fleet sprinters an old one is always the
possessor of well-developed sinews and muscles which
would almost turn the teeth of a crosscut saw.’ Quite

“Vigilans”: I’m with those who hold
the opinion that the most venomous snake in Aus
tralia is the death-adder. I was riding behind a
number of blacks on a Kimberley (W.A.) pad with
high grass on each side, when the boy leading a
pack-horse was suddenly struck by one of the crawl-
ers. Jumping down at once I found black brother
lying on the ground clasping his leg. “Boss, me
die! Snake bittern me!” he exclaimed. The wound
consisted of four tiny punctures, mere pin-pricks
We got to work on it at once. While one darkv
vigorously sucked the wound I twisted my hand-
kerchief round the limb to arrest circulation. Then
they carried him to my camp, running all the way.
I used ammonia and whisky, the only remedies I
had, but he died within two hours. The blacks were
surprised that the bite did not prove fatal fnore
quickly. They told me that two or three minutes
was the usual notice given. Shortly after the bite
the victim suffered a racking pain, which travelled
up the leg, and then passed successively to the abdo-
men, both arms and the other leg. Severe vomiting
set in within 20 minutes, and continued to within
a few minutes of death. A spasm seized his throat
as if he were suffocating. The whole body became
icy cold, in spite of friction and other artificial
means of keeping it warm. A cold sweat covered
the head and chest. The power of speech was then
lost, but consciousness and hearing remained almost
to the last. The sense of drowsiness increased; he
seemed unable to resist an overpowering desire to
sleep. All our attempts to keep him awake proved
vain, and the instant he yielded to sleep he gave
up the ghost and the rest of his property.
“E.G.H.”: A Governor’s party saw more
of Bobby King than of any other nigger in Queens-
land. It was this way ? Many years ago I was help-
ing to run a station at the foot of the Bunya Range.
Sir George Bowen, Queensland’s early-day Governor,
and his lady were making a vice-regal progress
through those parts of the State which were then
get-at-able, and stayed a few days at our place to
have a look at the Bunya pines, which were then in
full fruit. Wishing to give the visitors some amuse-
ment, it was arranged that the blacks should show
their prowess, amongst other things, at tree-climb-
ing. Bobby King was selected for the task. Bobby
was a splendid specimen of the aboriginal, and when
arrayed in a Garibaldi shirt and moleskin trousers,
given him in honor of the Governor’s visit, he was
easily the most imposing-looking member of the
party. A suitable tree having been selected, Bobby
started to take off his clothes. At this juncture the
manager, the master of the ceremonies, interfered.
“Baal you take him off trouser! ! White ‘Mary no
like him.” So Bobby had to make the attempt trou-
sers and all. Alas, he could not manage it! His
nether garments hampered his movements. After
two tries he threw down his vine in disgust and
stalked off. “What’s the matter?” asked Bowen.
He was told that no climbing could be done with
trousers on. “Tell him to take them off,” com-
manded his Ex., and turning towards his lady he
said, “You don’t mind, my dear?” She didn’t mind;
so Bobby was called back, and, divested of his gar-
ments, displayed his agility to the admiring specta-
tors.

“Fisher”: A few issues back an Abo-
liar told of how he had discovered a centipede suck-
ling her young, and he called for a
seconder. I’ll take on the job. Within
the last two months I have unearthed
a couple of these creatures. One had
her eggs hunched up amongst her legs,
while the other had a “litter.” When
I straightened the mother out I closely
examined her, and left convinced that
the ’pedes bring up the infant in the
way human mothers used to once upon a
time.
THE DRY COW.

When Tummus came upon the land,
He said he’d nowt to do but plough,
And plant some cabbage out of hand,
And buy a piglet and a cow.
He bought the cow at Major’s sale,
Because he liked her yellow tail.
’Twas three days later when he went
To Major, up at Stop-and-See,
To breathe his patient discontent.
“Yon cow ain’t givin’ milk,” said he.
Said Major: “Dash, and blarst it 1 Why,
I said the blanky cow was dry!”
Tom turned away, and in a. week
To Major he came back again.
His air was sad, his voice was meek,
The subject seemed to give him pain.
“That cow,” he said, “I bought from you
Won’t milk no matter what I do.”
Dan Major’s hat spun off his head,
In Major’s eye red anger glowed.
“You blighted mug, she’s DRY! ” he said.
Retorted Tummy: “Dry, be blowedd
I’ve hosed her every day, you bilk,
And still she doesn’t give no milk!”

Died a few days back, Geofge Perrett, of
Singleton, one of the best-known and best-
liked men in northern N.S.W. Though he
lived to 84, he had never had occasion to
consult a doctor, and his first illness was
his last. Son of an old-time northern
police inspector, he served his apprentice-
ship with old John Brush, Sydney’s early-
day saddler, who kept shop next to the
original Anthony Hordern’s little softgoods
depot on Brickfield Hill. He rode in the
first train that left Sydney for Parramatta,
and saw some few of the convict servants
kicking the heated atmosphere from the old
gallows-tree near the White Swan Hotel
on the Great Northern-road at Singleton.
Adelaide University Council has had the
unusual excitement of a contested election.
Williams, the Government’s Director of Edu-
cation, just dead, was replaced by Maughan,
his successor in that post; and S. J. Jacobs,
retiring on account of business ties, was fol-
lowed by Goodman, head of the tramways—
this latter being a concession to the engineer-
ing school, which has just gained the right to
grant degrees. The Senate (practically the
whole body of graduates) does the electing,
and it preferred these two to Noel Webb,
barrister. It was the first contested election
since 1907, other vacancies (which, by death
or resignation, occur at the rate of about one
a year) having brought out only the candi-
dates required.
After about four years’ service in London
as High Commissioner for Maoriland, Wil-
liam Ilall-Jones (as distinct from mere Bill
Jones) is on his way back to the scene of
his early carpentry. Jones started as a
severe democrat in the House of Reps, in
1890, and retained his reputation in that
respect until after the death of Richard Sed-
don, when he was acting-Premier for a
while. About that time his health broke
down, and in 1908 he was handed the High
Commissionership, and, later on, a tuppenny
title. It is doubtful if he will return to
politics. He is over 60, and a fairly tired man.
Also, a title isn’t unduly popular in M.L.,
especially when it is daubed on an erstwhile
popular democrat.

Woodrow Wilson begins his term of office
at the White House with a point blank re-
fusal to shake hands with the whole popu-
lation of the United States. During previous
Presidencies anybody had the privilege of
strolling in to see the chief man of the Re-
public and waste his time. Roosevelt rather
liked the absurd custom, and Taft hadn’t
the energy to make a change, but Wilson
takes the national bore by the whiskers, and
mentions that he can’t do the work of the
country and waste all his own time in one
and the same act; so the handshake insti-
tution is off.
James Curley, for 26 years miners’ gen-
eral secretary at Newcastle, died a few days
back. He was one of the old school of trade
unionists, and when he sat in the N.S.W.
Assembly for a while it was as a Freetrader.
As a matter of fact, he didn’t know much
outside coal. But the coal business he
knew inside and out, and when it came to
the fixing of a selling price, by which the
hewing rate is governed, Curley could discuss
the trade with any of them. The owners
once. recognised this in a curious way by
offering him their secretaryship at about
three times the salary the miners were giving
him; but he wouldn’t be tempted. His in-
fluence with the other side naturally wasn’t
weakened thereby, and, as the miners trusted
to his special knowledge as well as his
honesty, he did fine work in keeping the
wheels going more or less smoothly at New-
castle. But the time came when the Peter
Bowlings arrived, and Curley began to be
reckoned out-of-date, and he moved out.

Engineer George Cowdery, who
crossed over at Blackheath (N.S.W.)
recently, aged 82, learned his busi-
ness in England, and was one of
George Stephenson’s young men at
the building of the Britannia Bridge
across the Menai Straits. He came
to Australia about 1854, and in 1863,
as district engineer on the Great
Southern line (N.S.W.), bored this
country’s first tunnels at I’icton and
Mittagong. Later, he had charge of
the Great Western from the Clarence
tunnel to Rydal—the Zig-Zag section.
In 1878 he became chief assistant to
Engineer-in-Chief William Mason,
whom he succeeded in 1880. Among
other jobs he built the Eveleigh (Syd-
ney) workshops and split the N.S.W.
railway system into districts. Then
he retired, and pottered around on a
comfortable pension for 22 years.
There are now two men on the High Court

Somebody on the ground suggested that a
prize should be offered to anybody who could
tell where the Archbishop’s see was. The

graduated at the Victoria University Col-
lege, then went to Oxford in 1908, special-
ised in anthropology, and a couple of years
back was sent to study the gentle Good-
enough Islander, who lives the simple life
off the south-west coast of Papua. Jenness
found the Goodenougher still bad enough,
although he had given up some of his plea-
sant practices, such as the burying of babies
with their dead mothers.
Westralia’s new Gov. Barron doesn’t mind
poking mild borak at his job. After inspect-
ing the guard of honor on his arrival at
Fremantle, he noticed Bowyangs regarding
him curiously. “Well,” he said, “do you
work in Fremantle?” “No,” replied Bow-
yangs ; “I don’t work anywhere. I’m one of
the unemployed.” “So am I, old chap,”
said his Ex. with a grin. “I must take a
run down here one day, and we’ll go fish-
ing.”
The Rev. F. Pilcher, a brother of C. E.
Pilcher, K.C., and other N. S. Wales Pil-
chers, died the other day in England. He
was an old King’s School (Parramatta) boy,
and was regarded in the old times as its most
brilliant scholar. With various exhibitions
and scholarships, young Pilcher proceeded to
Oxford ; thence he went into the Church, and
settled down to a comfortable living in the
old University, town. The father of the
Pilchers was a solicitor, Henry Incledon
Pilcher, who practised at Maitland in the
’thirties.
Old Peter Waite, of Adelaide, came along
lately with a cheque for £lO,OOO to start a
provident fund for Elder, Smith and Co.’s
employees : and Barr Smith, who is the big-
gest shareholder in the co., may be expected
to put a bit on to that. Waite, an old man
now, was one of Thomas Elder’s lieutenants
in opening up the northern salt-bush runs, and
was reckoned the best dry-country sheep-
man in Australia. He and Elder were re-
sponsible for introducing camels to squat-
ting work in Australia. Like Tyson and
McCaughey, Australia’s other big sheep men,
Elder never married ; and there is not now an
Elder among all the shareholders in the big
woolly business which he and his brother-
in-law, Barr Smith, founded.
“U.S.” says “So long!” to the gentleman
Kink O’Malley copied his hat from :
By last mail nevys came of the death of Joaquin
Miller, “the poet of the Sierras.” His real name
was Oincinnatus Himer Miller; but he thought that
too. absurdly ridiculous, so invented the Joaquin,
which pleasantly identified him with the San Joa-
quin country. When xiuite a young man he became
a county court Judge! and that gave him a lot of
insight into life. His first volume of poetry, “Songs
of'the Sierras,” took well, and put him in funds for
a trip to Europe. Back again, he wrote a good deal
more poetry, but his vein was soon exhausted. Still
he wrote on, for he had an overpowering fluency.
The trouble was that he had nothing to say. Pro-
bably discerning this, he took to journalism. Free-
lancing, he roamed everywhere in the States, and
became known from Alaska to San Fran., from
Boston to Seattle. He always stuck to the glorified
cowboy costume, and was invited to lecture as soon
as he pitched on a town. Thus he kept up his
supnlv of money, though he was too capricious for the
purposes of the lecture bureaus. Joaquin had a
rather troublesome spouse, but otherwise he lounged
through existence with the easy flair of a Gil Bias,
and was welcomed wherever a good yarn was in
favor.
“Melb” on a Messiah deposed and now
dead
James Fisher, the Nuna wading Messiah, who has
died in Westralia, was not an impostor, but a victim
of delusions. His theological genesis came from
Johanna Southcott, the old woman who foretold
that she would five birth to the Messiah, for whom
a £5OO silver cradle was prepared—now stored in a
Manchester museum. Her followers passed over to
John Wroe, founder of the Wroeites, Christian Israel-
ites, or Beardies, of whom Fisher was one. He gave
out that the Apostolate would descend to him, but
Fitzrov, Wroe’s stronghold, would not allow it. So
he founded the Church of the Firstborn, in Nuna-
wading, and had 120 adherents, men and women.
His religion was an amazing compound of Christian-
ity, Mormonism, Freemasonry and spiritualism. Be-
tween times he was a charcoal-burner. His wife had
three sisters—Mrs. Rintel, Mrs. Wakefield and Mina,
who was unmarried. Their mother had a profound
belief in Fisher. Both she and Mina used to receive
spiritualistic revelations, which testified to Fisher’s
claims. Rintel was a well-known fat Jew pedlar,
always in rusty black, with a little straw hat on the
back of his head. Fisher said he was the Devil, and
declared that Rintel bewitched his two horses, Two-
penny and Old Tom, so that they would not pull the
charcoal which he (Fisher) burnt. Rintel pulled
Fisher’s leg unmercifully. Once he pretended to make a
Freemason of him at a house in Prahran, with a lot
of theatrical regalia, swords, stars and what not, ob-
tained by Rintel and a friend from Mother Cleeland’s
old clo’ shop in Stephen-street. Coppin commissioned
a dramatist to write him a farce, called “Fisher and
the Freemasons,” meaning to act Fisher himself. It
was partly written. If Garnet Walch, Marcus
Clarke, or Bob Whitworth had only been on the spot,
there would have been a theatrical sensation. Fisher
meantime got off some remarkably successful “pro-
phecies,” especially one that Rev. D. J. Draper
would never return to Australia alive. He was
drowned in the s.s. London with G. V. Brooke. The
end began with a police-court case at Oakleigh,
wherein >'’isher was sued by one of his followers,
Andrew Wilson, known as Simon Peter, for £lO,
which Fisher had obtained in order that he might
restore Wilson’s dead child to life. Wi.ls'on might
not have said anything but for Fisher obtaining an
unlucky revelation that he must have Wilson’s wife.
Still, the mummery lasted a while longer. A favorite
game of the faithful was what they called Chasing
the Old Devil Round the Stump, with all the first-
born men and women running about in a paddock,
by moonlight.

“Sub Rosa”: The Federal Government
may be blamed for appointing anybody at
all as Director of Education for the North
ern Territory, but it can scarcely be found
fault with for its choice. James Leonard
Rossi ter, the new Director, possesses nearly
all the qualities necessary. Certainly he is no
more than 25, but that is a fault he will cor-
rect. Only three years out of the University
Training College, that time has been devoted
to the organising of the Unley District
High School, the second largest of its kind
in South Aus. His work there has been a
distinct success, and his pupils have put up
a record at the University exams, that will
be hard for future masters to equal. Rossi-
ter —tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested and
well-proportioned—is a keen sportsman, and
the favorite recreation of the Territory,
tennis, will gain a new champion in him.
The tribulations of Frank D. Brown, who
was general manager for the Singer Sewing
Machine Co. in half a hemisphere, and who
was described by a Judge before whom he
appeared on one of his recent trials as the
highest salaried man in N. S. Wales, seem
to be at last at an end. After emerging
safely from the afore-mentioned trials, he
filed his schedule, and was promptly sooled
back to the law corral by his creditors, who
accused him of flagrant breaches of the Bank-
ruptcy Act. Investigation into the charges
was concluded last week, when it was an-
nounced to the accusers that they were
mostly barking up the wrong vegetable.
Brown has now his certificate of discharge,
and can go after the highest-salary stakes
again as soon as he feels that way.

Fashion note from “Jeames” :
Lady Dorothy Nevill’s death, in London last
week, snapped a link with the Very Early Victorian
epoch. She was a daughter of the third Earl
Orford—the family which the famous Robert Wal-
pole of George ll.’s day founded —and must have
been close on 90 years of age. The most
tireless hunter of soeial lions in Europe, she not
only knew everybody who was anybody in Society,
but all the actors, artists, dynamitards, Americans,
tradespeople, oversea premiers and similar int , er ‘
esting” folk who from time to time burst into that
no longer charmed circle. It is said of her that
she had met every British statesman of any COI j;
sequence, from Lord Palmerston onwards. Disraei
was one of her particular friends. Illness alon
debarred her last year from placing the coping"*"®
on her career as a collector of intellectuals, by io
gathering with N.S.W.’s James McGowen.
THE WORRIES OF A GREAT LEADER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. Joseph Cook complains that the Federal Gov-
ernment could not even guarantee that the maternity
bonus was going to the persons entitled to it. One
claimant’s husband had bought a bangle with the
money, and there was nothing to prevent the money
being spent in that way.— Melbourne Age.

The note we get for our infant trilling?
Who has got patience and time to spare?
Let him speak up now! He will save, I swear,
Our brave Jocook from a breakdown killing!
Who will shadow the llonus shilling?
The big men charge at the larger things,
The small men nag at the foolish trifles ;
The crowd are out where the fresh wind sings,
But Joe an eye to the keyhole brings,
Or, under the bed, a dust-sneeze stifles.
With black suspicion his soul ’tis filling:

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Metters, Ltd., manufacturers of stoves,
windmills, oil engines, etc., took over a business
in 1908, and paid £29,656 for the goodwill. The
public came in a couple of years ago, when exten-
sions called for more Capital. In the small table
that follows, the goodwill paper item is not re-
garded as an asset: —

About 25 years ago an enterprising young man
named Fred Metters opened a very small shop in
Adelaide for the manufacture and sale of cooking
ovens and stoves. A few years later he was joined
in partnership by H. L. Spring, who brought in a
little money, which it was decided to employ in
extending the business to Westralia. That was a
lucky or a long-headed move; for population soon
poured westward to the goldfields, and fuel cookers
were in great demand. Business grew fast, but
the partners, by cutting down their own draws out
of the business to the irreducible, were able to
keep pace with it without going to the public for
capital. Things went on like that till H. L.
Spring, being, apparently, the man with the bigger
ideas, bought his partner out. Simultaneously, or
thereabouts, he decided to open out in Sydney.
These movements drove Metters and Co. for the
first time to the public for capital; and to assist in
that process a co. was formed privately. The
assets stood in the firm’s books at about £55,000.
But as plant, patterns, patents, etc., had been written
down hard, as freeholds had appreciated, and as the
business as a going concern was obviously worth
something considerable, 50 p.c. was added to that
£55,000, and shares to that total amount were
issued in the new co. to the vendors; and the
shares issued to the people who put up the new
capital were issued at a total discount of £2OOO.
These two things account for the item, “Goodwill,
£29,656,” shown in the balance-sheet.
F*or the first three years the co. pursued the old
policy of paying out very little in dividends, hang-
ing on to every available pound for business-
extension purposes. In 1911 this money was formally
transferred to capital, one bonus share being issued
for every five old ones. Then, as new lines were
manufactured and stocks necessarily were increased
thereby, another 20,000 shares were offered to the
public; the table shows that these realised a pre-
mium of £3177. Shareholders were invited when
the next interim div. was paid to put their money
back into the business at par, and most of them
accepted the invitation. Thus, the capital has-been
brought up to £145,019; and there is another
£54,981 authorised. Liabilities total £53,296;
about one-fifth of this is represented by mortgages
on land purchased for factory purposes in Sydney
and Adelaide. The capital and the borrowed money
is represented by—Stock £75,384 (taken in at
cost), freeholds (cost) £48,000, plant £31,784,
book debts (less reserve) £35,465, and a few unim-
portant sundries. Considering the rapid extension
of the business and the value of the freeholds, the
liabilities are not very excessive; but the sheet
will look all the better if more share capital is got
in to provide for the further extensions which the
progressive co. is bound to make. Plant, build-
ings and patents appear to be written down an
adequate 10 p.c. or more. The business has been
a profitable one for many years, and the 10 p.c. is
still comfortably earned; but with regard to the
£6374 put to reserves last year it should he noted
that £2641 came from profit on land resumed by
the Westralian Government. Also, it is highly pro-
bable that the profit won’t show anything like the
return on capital which it formerly did. Naturally,
first the firm and then the co. went in for the most
profitable lines to begin with, and though there is
still great scope, given decent Protection, the de-
partments that have come last and those that will
come in the future will probably be more of a
bread-and-butter character.

But the dividends paid during the past couple of
years are merely a trifle on account of accumula-
tions due on pref. shares. It was this wav. The co.
was formed 16 years ago in 260,000 shares of £1
each, of which the promoters collared £lOO,OOO.
The £160,000 of cash being quite inadequate,
£200,000 was raised on mortgage debentures; and
that, again, being inadequate, another £lOO,OOO was
raised on 8 p.c. pref. shares, half of the 8 p.c. being
cumulative. For many years it was hard work to
pay even the interest on the debenture capital, so
the prefs. got nothing, and the 4 p.c. p.a. to which
they were entitled began to bank up threateningly.
At the end of December, £33,706 was owing on this
account; and thar--amount, by the way, is not reck-
oned among the liabilities. If it was included, the
deficit shown in the table would soar up to corres-
pond. It takes £4OOO a year to meet'the current
demand for cumulative pref. dividend, so that even
now the co. is very little more than holding its own
—it has reduced the arrears by only £1125 in three
years. But besides the debentures and the pref.
capital, there is another cormorant standing in
ahead of the unfortunate ordinary shareholders. The
object of the co. was to continue the Emu Bay and
Mount Bischoff Co.’s Burnie-Waratah line, and that
involved the leasing of that line at a cost (at pre-
sent) of £10,370 a year. So the ordinary share-
holder must stay hungry until —(1) the Emu Bay
and Mount Bischoff Co. has had £10,370 a year;
(2) the debenture-holders have had their annual
£lO,OOO, or thereabouts; (3) the £30,000 or so
of arrears on cum. pref. shares has been wiped
out; (4) 8 p.c. has been paid to pref. shareholders.
And then there is a sinking fund to be provided for
the extinction of the debenture debt when there is
any money available for the purpose. Having
lately, mainly on account of the metal boom, got
ahead of things a little, the directors had an idea
that it would show a very nice disposition on the
debenture-holders’ part if they consented to money
being put into rolling-stock which would otherwise
have to go to sinking fund. “Owing to a feeling in
London adverse to the proposal,” the scheme fell
through. It was really most inconsiderate of the
debenture-holders. In such circumstances, the share-
holder is always inclined to ask, “Why should we
stand all the racket? Why shouldn’t they lose a
bit, too? The answer is dimply that when people
are prepared to risk their capital they won’t take
debentures or make deposits carrying a low rate of
interest. The shareholder, on the other hand, is
assumed to be prepared to risk his capital, and in
return he has the chance of getting a high rate bf
interest.

With one excepticn that is the best surplus ever
working exes, shewn in the cc.’s histery. As men-
tioned just now, the metal boom has been mainly re-
sponsible. But already the metal boom isn’t what
it was—copper, lead and zinc have all had a bad
tall. However, developments in the treatment of
zinc-bearing ores have been pretty rapid of late, and
this co. will no doubt get some benefit from that.
But there is no prospect that it will get enough
benefit to allow oi the ordinary shareholders enjoy-
ing a meal in this generation. Something entirely

etc That is to say, nothing is to be paid for good-
. J bi- S co which bought from the Brisbane
Electric Supply Co., paid £35,258 for the goodwill
of that concern; hence, being liable to have a
funeral in 1940, if it wants to have all its capital
intact when it expires it must put aside out of pro-
ty)., a sufficient sum to wipe out the amount of the
factitious asset within the next 27 years. To that
extent the profits mentioned above have to be dis-
counted. The present total of the fund is £6500.
Against the goodwill item, which is an asset that
can only be seen with the eye of faith, there are the
Sit??® reserves: Sinking Fund above-mentioned,
£6500; Renewal, Replacement and Contingency
Fund, £20,537; Reserve Fund, £5000; Dividend
Equalisation Fund, £3000; Accident Insurance
Fund, £1785; unappropriated balance, £1453.
That Renewal and Replacement Fund may be a very
poor reserve; it may be merely a set-off against
actual wear and tear. On the other hand, wear and
tear may be provided for quite independently—
there is no way of telling definitely. It looks, how-
ever, as though current renewals have been charged
up to working expenses, so the probabilities are that
the fund is a reserve which may or may not be
needed by-and-bye to meet extra special replace-
ments and other contingencies. Reckoning it, then,
amongst the reserves, it will be seen that the accu-
mulation of undivided profits now exceeds the amount
of the paper asset; in other words, there are now
substantial assets to represent all the capital. The
directors after recommending the dividend to be paid
for the past half-year add: “We have also decided
to issue on or before the 30th April next 40,000
contributing shares paid to 10s. These will be issued
to the shareholders in proportion to their present
holding, and will represent about 28 shares to each
1001 Chares now held.” Presumably these are to be
issued as bonus shares, although the terms are not
mentioned. Certainly, as mentioned above, the co.
has 27 years certain wherein to wipe out the bal-
ance of the intangible goodwill asset, and there are
more than enough reserves to do it at once; never-
theless, the issue of any bonus shares seems to be un-
necessarily rushing things. The truth is the company
has a very solid balance left after uaying 12* p.c.
div. on ordinary shares; and the creation of bonus
shares is the plan of getting rid of some of it
which involves the least danger of a public outcry.
The cash position is reasonably good. Liquid assets
slightly exceed the liabilities. Generally speaking,
the position is sound, and shareholders have no
reason to feel at all sorry for themselves.

But of the half-year’s dividend two-thirds is paid by
way of a silver-wedding gift to the shareholders
The co. works on the lines of the foolish fowl that
buries its head when the public is looking on. It
supplies the minimum of information about itself
apparently having the idea that the less a co. -tells
about itself the more highly respectable it will be
thought. It is one of the few which don’t say how
much the trust estates in hand amount to, though
it is highly desirable to have that information in
order that one may tell whether the funds are suffi-
cient protection for the beneficiaries under the trusts
committed to the co. s charge. The chances are that
they are adequate. The risks of a trustee co. arise
chiefly from the misinterpretation of wills and other
instruments ; and seeing that three-fifths the direc-
tors are barristers, including two K.C.’s, the Equity’s
risks of that kind ought to he under the average.
Anyway, in addition to the reserves of £33,290 and
the paid capital of £25,000, there is a very solid
£lOO,OOO for which shareholders are liable. Tes-
tators haven’t, therefore, much to worry about. The
next little table shows the nature of the co.’s in-
vestments :

Income from all sources is lumped together, but the
interest earnings alone should be ample nowadays to
pay the ordinary 10 p.c. dividend, leaving the whole
of the profit from the trustee business to strengthen
the reserves and add to the peace of mind of both
shareholders and clients. Like most other trustee
cos., the Equity is doing a service to the public as
well as to itself by pointing out the risks that all
parties take on when an unprofessional executor is
appointed. To the present accounts, for instance, it
adds a summary of the obligations of a trustee and
the risks of a testator. A not commonly known
matter of interest is that, supposing a testator ap-
points a friend to be his trustee, and that'friend dies,
the friend’s own executor automatically takes over
the trust, though he may be a person quite unknown
to the original testator, or he may be a person whom
the original testator knew too well to trust. A diffi-
culty like that could never arise if the man who
made the will passed it on to a trustee co., whose
life, of course, doesn’t depend upon the life of any
one man or any dozen men.

Not many Australian trading cos. can show better
results than that for the past decade. Eight or
nine years ago Wright-Heaton’s had a pretty thorough
clean-up, and £13,000 of the reserves was written
off at one stroke; at the same time the old tendency
to pay big dividends was repressed. That was just
after the bad seasons of 1903-4, and a management
which was to a great extent new set out to reap the
succeeding harvest of good seasons without having any
undisclosed dead-horse to work off. It reckoned, how-
ever, that there would probably be some dead-horse
presently; so it began to provide in advance for
contingencies. Most of the sums shown as written
off went to this contingency account. The run of
good seasons has been prolonged. There was a
touch of drought last year, certainly; but the rains
came in the nick of time to save the N.S.W. wheat
crops, at any rate, and a record harvest was reaped
—to the surprise of most people. Wright, Heaton
and Co. have naturally shared bountifully in this
continued prosperity; and the bad debts and other
contingencies they provided for in advance haven’t
turned up. Consequently, they have shaken £21,000
out of these hidden reserves, and piled it on top of
their formal reserves. What they are going to do
with it isn’t _ announced yet; hut what is at the
back of the directors’ heads may perhaps be guessed
from the fact that lately the capital was increased
from £lOO,OOO to £150,000 by the creation of
20,000 new shares of 50s. each. True, “the
directors have no intention at present of issuing
any of the new shares”; all the same, those new
shares weren’t created just for fun—the management
isn’t the sort to do that kind of thing. If the back-
country has another good year or two, and there is
still something left in the contingency stocking,
shareholders will probably be offered another insult.
The co. used to be little more than a carrier.
Then it went in for the fodder business. Subse-
quently it pushed out into general merchandise.
The two businesses —carrying and station-supplies—
work in together splendidly. This development has
produced very considerable changes in the balance-
sheet :

The eo. owns the whole of the stock in the McCul-
loch Carrying Co., which is really the Victorian end
of the business. The big change has been in the
growth of book debts. The outbacker, getting his
main crop and his cheque only once a year, has
developed the bad habit of running long accounts.
Even the well-to-do wheat farmer gives his p.n. pay-
able in February; and if he hasn’t given his p.n.
he pretty often doesn’t expect to pay till that
month. When he has a clearing-out sale he holds
out the same bait. Of course, he doesn’t charge in-
terest ; he merely relies upon getting bids about 20
p.c. higher than if he required cash. There is
danger in financing him, no doubt; for the crop of
wheat or wool may fail. But the man who sells him
his supplies knows that, anyhow, he has that cus-
tomer in his hag; and the customer who is in the
hag doesn’t generally get the most liberal treatment
in the world. These remarks, of course, don’t apply
in particular to this co.’s trading; they are thrown
out in a general way to account for the big amount
of the book debts, and to explain why so many
country storekeepers, who have the capital to see
them (and their customers) through, are able to re-
tire in affluence.

Combine. Originally its beer-mill was leased to the
Combine—officially the Carlton and United Brew-
eries, Ltd.—but afterwards the latter found that
the premises were not wanted, so it bought out of
the bargain, and 12 months ago the Foster paid a
bonus with the proceeds. As the premises are shut
up, the co.’s sole source of revenue is from its
holding in the Combine. On its 72,500 shares it
draws a steady 8 p.c., the Combine having paid

Thus with the rapidly increasing membership the
dividend is growing faster than the profits. Take
the past half-year: profits increased by £2006 while
the 7 p.c. dividend called for an additional £2157 -
and the lay-by isn’t very enormous. It’s a case
of starving the reserves? to feed the shareholders and
the shareholders will feel the after-effect if a sudden
slump 'looks in. There are £193,391 of advances
and as the reserves are less than 5 p.c. of that total
it wouldn’t need a very big slump to wipe them out
entirely. Things would be quite right, no doubt if
advances were not simply racing- ahead. At Dee
1907, they were only and, as mentioned
before, they have now reached £193,391; and it
isn’t the old advances that cause trouble—it is the
later ones, made on boom values, and on which verv
little has been repaid. The only way to strengthen
the position is by keeping the brake on divs., and if
necessary, reducing them to, say, 6 or 6* p.c. ’ It
will hurt, but it’s safest in the long run.

At the beginning of the half-year the price of gas
was reduced to 6s. 4d. per 1000 ft., with discounts
to large consumers; and the only visible effect has
been to push up the profits. The reserves now ex-
ceed the capital ( £67,500), but it has taken a
long while to add the lash £l5OO ; six years ago
they already exceeded £66,000. The cash position
has improved rather more rapidly. ’This shows the

That is £2559 to the good in five years. The ex-
planation, of course, is that there have been very few
extensions or plant-additions to consume the sur-
plus revenue. The congestion policy Mes heavy on
Ballarat’s chest, and the old town makes- little*
progress now that the local gold-mining industry
has faded. Still, when a gas co. has had its repairs'
and renewals provided for it, and £2559 added to
its till money in five years, after paying a 10 or 12
p.c. div., it can’t complain.

A matter decided before Justice Ferguson
in Sydney, the other day, is calculated to sharpen up
those people who have dealings with commission
agents. A Dr. Daish owned a small western (N.S.W.)
squattage and wanted to sell it. Following the usual
plan, he sent particulars of the property to the best-
known agents in the business. These agents in turn
no doubt followed their usual plan of sending on the
information to possible buyers on their lists. A
Dubbo firm appears to have thus mentioned the pro-
perty to a man at Mildura. But the Mildura man,
instead of communicating with the Dubbo people,
got from certain Sydney agents (who also had the
property on their list) the “firm offer” of the pro-
perty for 12 days for purposes of inspection. The
property took the eye of the Mildura man, who
visited it in company with a representative of the
Sydney firm, and he bought it. Then trouble began
over the commission. The vendor did not know the
Dubbo people in the matter; he had given the “firm
offer” to the Sydney agents, and through them the
cheque had come on the completion of the purchase.
“If,” said he, “two agents have had a hand in this
business, fight it out between yourselves. I have
sold the property only once. I pay only one com-
mission—to the people who brought me the buyer
and the cheque.” That was the common-sense view
of the matter. But the Law had another view. As
Dr. Brissenden put it for the plaintiffs, all he had to
do was to show that he had forged one link in the
chain that brought seller and buyer together; if he
could prove that, he must succeed. And succeed he
did. The Judge held it to be law in N. S. Wales
(and there appears to be no doubt on the point) that
an agent may recover commission if he does any
material thing to bring about the relation of vendor
and purchaser, though'he may have nothing whatever
to do with the transaction when the two come to-
gether. In England a man may avoid being hit
twice in this way, being protected by the inter-
pleader process; it is left then to the agents to show
who of them are entitled to the commission. Here,
not being thus protected, a man is liable to be
struck for half a dozen commissions on the one sale
unless he bargains beforehand with all the agents on
whose books he has put his property.
Towards the end of last year C. S. Her-
zig, who was on 8., M. and Co.’s staff in Aus-
tralia some time ago, obtained permission, on be-
half of certain large shareholders, to make an ex-
amination of Great Cobar. When the report was put
in the “certain large shareholders’ ” hands, the
directors thought they would like it, and paid £250
to get it. Having got it, they have issued it, along
with a circular of their own, to the shareholders.
It is for the most part merely entertaining reading
to those who know anything about the mine and its
past and present costs. Last year the management
did not hesitate to make large promises of divi-
dends ; but Herzig’s remarks are too “strong wen
for them, wherefore they cold-bloodedly say: The
conclusions arrived at are based upon assumptions
of working conditions which have hitherto never been
even approximately attained.” In the face of the re-

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-

building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,

From June to September the Bacchus Marsh Shire
Council (Vic.) crushed and spread 3000 cub. yds. of
road metal, at an average cost of 2s. 6d. per cub.
yd., and the cost of the spalls per cub. yd. averaged
2s. 4d., making a total cost of 4s. lOd. per cub. yd.,
broken and spread. Their last contract under the
hand-breaking system amounted to 6s. 3d. per cub.
yd., stacked on the roadside, and spreading Is. ;
total 7s. 3d., as against 4s. lOd. — a saving of 2s. sd.

suits of last year’s operations, the directors could
really say nothing else.
Herzig assumes throughout that the old Great
Cobar Syndicate consisted of a pack of fools, who
knew nothing, in spite of the undoubted fact that
they worked the mine for 12 years and made hand-
some profits out of it for at least 10 years of the
period. The syndicate’s smelting operations were
not half so crude as Herzig seems to think. Slags
as low as 35 p.c. in silica had disappeared many
years before the mine was sold in 1906, and slags
of 40 to 45 p.c. silica were the vogue years before
the new co. arrived. He tells a silly yarn, too, that the
syndicate bought quartz and mined barren slate to
enable it to smelt the ore. It can be authoritatively
stated that the cost of quartz bought in 1905 was
o.Bld. per ton of ore smelted, or something less than
Id. per ton. As a matter of fact, the quartz was
bought to use in the second smelting of the first
and low-grade matte for the purpose of raising the
copper to a shipping grade. They still use quartz
at Cobar for the same purpose, only it is contained
in the Cobar Gold Mine ore, and it isn’t called
quartz these days. Their converters would not be
much use to them if they could not get quartz,
whether in or out of an ore.
As regards the 3J to 4 p.c. copper which Herzig
states the ore contained at the date of purchase, he
can rest assured that if Great Cobar ore had contained
that much copper at that date, the Great Cobar,
Limited, would not have had enough money to buy
the mine. Kendall certainly said it contained about
3.79 p.c., but that is nothing to go by. He said a
lot of other things as well. He simply made a mis-
take in his estimate, but he was satisfied —and so,
naturally, was the Great Cobar Syndicate. As a
matter of fact, for four years prior to 1906, the
recoveries of copper had not reached 3 p.c., and in
six years it only reached 3 p.c. twice —once in 1900
and again in 1902. The new furnace plant was to
save a lot more copper than the old furnace plant
(built after Sticht’s Mount Lyell furnaces, which are
the best copper furnace design ever introduced into
Australasia). All the old slag dumps produced by
the operations of the syndicate were also to be re-
smelted. But it is well to note that those dumps
are still in situ , with the sampling marks of later
years on them ; and, what is more to the point, the
assay of those old dumps will compare favorably
as regards copper, silver and gold contents with the
slags from the new plant. Yet the new plant has
cost the best part of half a million sterling. It is
true that the present co. is carting thousands of tons
of old reverb, furnace slags made before 1889, and is
re-smelting them; but it hides the fact by in-
cluding them under the heading of “Converter re-
vert.” It is needless to say that the copper recov-
ered from them goes to the credit of recoveries from
ore.
It can be stated on unquestionable authority that
the copper, gold and silver contents recovered for
the four half-years prior to December, 1905,
were 2.5 p.c. copper per ton of ore in 1904, and 2.24
p.c. copper in 1905 ; and the contents of precious
metals per ton of metallic copper in 1904 were 1.95
oz. gold and 15.450 z. silver, and in 1905 they
were 2.470 z. gold and 17.250 z. silver. The recov-
eries per ton of ore in 1905 were 2.24 p.c. copper,
26gr. gold and 0.380 z. silver. From such recov-
eries a big profit was made. To-day the copper re-
covered is less, but the gold recoveries are far in
excess of the syndicate’s recoveries, thanks to the
gold ore of the Cobar Gold Mines and to the for-
tunate discovery last year of soz. to lOoz. gold ore in
the Peak mine. Now Herzig dismisses the Peak
mine in a few words, whereas the small boy in the
street in Cobar knows how much gold came out of
the Peak last year, even if all of it did not get into
the blast furnaces.
The situation at Cobar, to put it bluntly, is this.
In spite of increased gold values per ton, smelted in
a plant that has cost 500,000 lovely sovereigns,
with the assistance of an imported manager, an im-
ported metallurgist, an imported engineer and an
imported underground manager, and with fair prices
for copper, Great Cobar, Limited, cannot make a
“real money” profit!
The cost of producing electrolytic copper by the
Great Cobar Syndicate for 1904 and 1905 was
£4B 9s. sd. and £5O 18s. lOd. per ton respec-
tively. Nothing is deducted from these costs for
the gold and silver contents, and they include all
charges for mining, development, smelting and con-
struction, freight on matte to Lithgow, all Lithgow
costs for refining matte to fine copper and fine cop-
per to electrolytic copper, the freight on such to
Sydney, with insurance and mint charges on gold
and silver and delivery f.o.b. on ship, Sydney Har-
bor. The total of all these charges per ton of ore
in 1904 was 225. Hid., and in 1905 it was 21s. 6.9 d.
The cost of £5O 18s. lOd. in 1905 oer ton of elec-
trolytic copper was the highest in the whole 12
vears of the syndicate’s history, and in the whole
12 years the cost of producing a ton of copper
exceeded £5O in only four half-years out of 24 half-
years of work. According to Herzig the best figure
that Great Cobar, Limited, can hope to reach is
275. 3d. per ton of ore, and everyone knows it is
costing considerably more than that to-day. .
The codlin moth in the Great Cobar apple is of
various kinds: a steady decrease in copper contents
from level to level, an equally steady increase in
the contents of magnetic oxide of iron, a steady
increase in the silica contents, the disappearance
(entirely or nearly so) of the southern ore body,
and the decrease in size of the only basic ore bodv
there is, which is in the north end, and, what is
worst, perhaps, a plant too large for the capacity
of the mine. Economy has been lost sight of in the
mad endeavor to find ore for the maw of the re-
morseless Plant. The furnaces yell for basic ore
and thev haven’t got it to give them. Not satisfied
with the huge tonnage of silicious ore already in
the Great Cobar and the Chesney, the co. bought
the Cobar Gold Mines. True, it only cost them a
few shillings to get some scrip printed. The eyes
of it were soon picked out, and now Great Cobar,
Ltd., has the nightmare of silicious ore in enormous
masses, with a ranidlv dwindling basic ore supply
looming large in front of it. _ The frantic effort
get rid of some of the silicious ghost has started
them on the road of water-concentration and the
Minerals Senaration Plant. This will lose hal
gold and silver contents and recover not more than
85 p.c. of the copper, if it has luck; but it wo t
do even that much at Herzig’s estimate of costs
What alone will save Great Cobar is a high price
for cooper, or a moderate price plus a spirit ot
economy 1 in imitation of the much-despised methods
of the old Great Cobar Syndicate. ,
“Stan”; Re the reported remark of Min-
ister for Mines Edden after bis visit to Ardlethan
—“Mr. Pittman (U.S.) visited the field about live
months ago, and since then only about 10ft.
sinking has been done.” (B. 20/3/’l3). When Pitt-
man first visited the Carpathia he says 12ft. was
the deepest point. At the date of his last visit a
shaft was down 52ft. The White Crystal had on his
first visit a shaft 30ft. deep. Since then three
other shafts have been put down, and have reached
60ft., 45ft. and 38ft. respectively. The Champion
has a shaft 40ft. deep. The Homeward Bound
shaft was about 3Qft.; a new shaft was started, and
is down 57 ft. The Wild Cherry has two shafts
over 40ft. The whole trouble is that an officer
of the Mines Department made a bloomer in pro-
nouncing the Carpathia to be of no value; and the
Ardlethan people ..did not forget to rub it in on
every opportunity when the Minister was around.
The Mines Department officials have, however, been
trying to cover the original mistake by discrediting
the fieF ; and I suppose they wi’l go on dom" it.

Mount Ross, Copeton (A.S.W.), cleaned
up 176 loads of washdirt (a load =24 cubic feet)
for 9cwt. of tin oxide and 404 carats of diamonds.
The diamonds sold for 20s. 6d. per carat, so the
total from that source was £414, and the tin
raised the harvest to £470, or £2 13s. 6d. per load.
This isn’t the whole value either, for lumps of blue
clay, saved with the hopperings, contain some
diamonds. They have been blocking out east and
west of the main water level. The dirt improves
in thickness to 4ft. on the western side, but the
average extraction seems to be about 18in. of
wash. A drive has also been taken south with a
view to blocking out in that direction. The wash
there is thin, but fairly good. No diamonds of
high value have yet been found, but small stones
are very numerous.

Nuggetty Ajax, Daylesford (Vic.), re-
turns to the call list, the first of the Ajax trio to
come to heel after a flattering three years of activity.
The trouble has been long expected, but the manage-
ment kept funds even till it was beaten by a yield
of 140 oz. from 900 tons. Then a 6d. call had to be.
The mine has not been popular since the co. em-
bargoed certain visiting experts, and these had
their revenge on the market. Neither flat make nor
vertical reef shows much pay dirt, so this call will
not be the last.

The Moore-Hesketh process isn’t dead,
nor is Iron, Steel and Metals Manufacturing Co.
Hesketh, one of the inventors, after the closing up
of the South Melbourne works, departed for India.
Later, he struck London and the black country.
Thenceforward the press didn’t relate his path. But
he has been grafting hard, and word comes again
that there is still a “probability of the process
being worked on a commercial basis in Great Bri-
tain within a short time.” Dear old friend, how
often have we heard the same words used! Simul-
taneously, the challenging of the co.’s patents is
talked of. This really isn’t bad news, for if J. Bull
talks of jumping the patent, it is tantamount to
stating that the process is worth grabbing.

February was a lean month for gold divs.
in the West, only £6500 being paid away. March’s
total, however, was close up to £100,000; and as
Boulder Perseverance and Associated Northern are
letting loose £55,000 between them, and as one or
two others are thinking of giving something, this
month’s distribution also promises to be substantial.
Boulder Perseverance paid its last dividend in 1909
and Associated Northern in 1911. The former isn’t
likely to pay much in the future, but with monthly
profits of between £6OOO and £7OOO assured for
some time to come, the Northern looks like keeping
on. Of course much depends on the rich shoot at
Ora Banda, which finger-burnt bears reckon is a
patch of secondary enrichment. +
Ivanhoe (W.A.) is getting leaner, and to
make the outlook worse the unfavorable eastern
country (the same that upset Boulder’s apple-cart
and pushed the remnants of its main shoot into the
Horseshoe) is becoming a menace. Last year
237,266 tons were treated for £468,782, and of
this £193,450 was gross profit. Dividends amount-
ing to 21s. per share absorbed (with taxes) £231,000,
which means that the co. paid away £37,550 more
than its earnings. Needless to say, this sort of
thing cannot last, and a further shrinkage in divs.
may be looked for. The mine has done well with a
total production of 7i millions sterling, but because
John Jones had 11 children before he was 97, it does
not follow that he will live to be 194 and have an-
other 11. . ,

Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) gives a 6dwt.
value to the crosscut of the No. 3 lode at 2630 ft.
This ore body is the southerly continuation of the
Ivanhoe east lode, but, although looking very miser-
able in both mines at present, it has never been half
as good in the Horseshoe as in the Ivanhoe. Horse-
shoe also announces that the winze on the No. 4
(Boulder) lode has been sunk 106 ft. below the
2630 ft. level, and assays loz. per ton in the bottom.
But it is patchy.

South Kalgurli had a final leave-taking
with shareholders in London last month prior to
joining forces with Hainault. The chairman stated
that from June, 1905, to January, 1913 801,000
tons had been raised and treated for 263,7000 z.,
which realised over £1,118,000, representing an
average recovery of 275. lid. per ton. Retreatment
of tailings whiie the plant was being remodelled re-
sulted in the recovery of an additional £45,000, of
which £22,000 was profit. The grade of ore milled
ranged from 395. lOd. in 1905 to 255. in 1912.
Plant and machinery had absorbed £62,000, and
£162 000 had been spent in development. Share-
holders had received £l4O 000 in dividends, and at
the date of the meeting the co. held £92,000 in
cash and realisable assets. Thus the original work-
ing capital of £74,500 entrusted to the directors
in 1905 had returned £232,000 up to the present
Considering the low grade of ore treated and high
cost of labor the chairman thought the achievement
was something to blow about As the Lake View,
or main lode had proved very disappointing at 1200 ft
and 1500 ft., and the western or Morty s lode had
gone out of the property at 1200 ft. or thereabouts,
the co. had been obliged to look around for some
other means of support, and had arranged to take
to its bosom the adjoining Hainault, which could
not make ends meet for the want of money to erect
a suitable plant. One advantage that would be
gained by taking over the Hainault would be that
drives could be continued across the boundary and
ore extracted right away. A proposal to make the
directors a present of £2500 m addition to their
ordinary nerks was scouted, and resolutions approv-
ing of the amalgamation were agreed to. #
Collie (W.A.) produced 295.000 tons of
coal in 1912, which is a record. The output would
have been much greater but for a fallmg-ofl in the
bunkering trade at the nearest port of Bunbury. The
area at present held under lease is 27,255 acres,
which represents an increase of about 130 acres for
the vear About 600 men are employed in the in-
dustry, and the average quantity raised per man m
1912 was approximately 521 tons. The poor bunker
ing trade at Bunbury militates against the progress
of the field, and until something is done to make
the 1 port more attractive things are not likely to
improve. » * »
Pavnes’ Find (W.A.) still produces a bit
of gold in shallow ground. Two or__three_lots_o£
lOOoz. or thereabouts have been obtained from pro-
spectors’ parcels at the State mill, and one or two
other crushings which look well are being cleaned
up. Several “good looking” bodies of ore are being
worked in the district, but depth will probably settle
the lot of them. Leastways, the appearance of the
country indicates that disaster.
* * * *
A London firm of gem experts has raised
the expectations of Poona (W.A.) emerald-hunters
by reporting (1) that the color and quality of some
of the stones sent for examination is most encoura-
ging, and (2) that the find is well worth further
prospecting. Claimholders are advised not to try
to-i engineer a boom, but to work in a small way
and not to glut the market with stones. As geolo-
gist Woodward described the ground as soft, the
report suggests washing to unearth the gems; but
this is said to be useless, as the good stones are
likely to be ibund in hard ground, and water is
scarce, anyhow.

During 1912, Greenbushes (W.A.) sent
away 4834 tons of tin valued at £55,722. The
money value of the return was £10,466 more than
that for 1911, but increased market value had a good
deal to do with this. A lot more men are now
employed on the field than at any other time during
the past five years. The Cornwall, however, is the
only mine where any sinking to speak of has been
carried on to date. One shaft is down 150 ft., and
another —subsidised by the Government —has reached
200 ft. An option was taken over this show by the
Birthday Gift a few months ago, but it has since
been thrown up.
* * * *
Golden Butterfly (W.A.) is still hopeful
of making a living out of its Kookynie property.
Last half-year’s production amounted to £5872, and
there was a working surplus of £1076. A slimes
plant, erected on borrowed money at a cost of £2OOO,
is expected to be running next month, after which
monthly profits are figured to average £l5OO. The
ore reserves don’t amount to much, and the show needs
development. If the co. spends its earnings in this
way, instead of trying to make a show by distribut-
ing premature dividends, it may do well in time.

Kulamadau, Woodlark Island (Papua),
reports by wireless (through s.s. Matunga) that a
crushing of 3258 tons (2044 tons from the hill and
1214 tons from No. 2 shaft) returned a total value
of approximately £4llO. News of a payable return
from Papua by wireless—things are moving!

Mills’ United, Charters Towers, is short-
ening hands; its stopes in the upper levels are be-
coming worked out. The fortnightly return was
743 tons for £1029, and the total this year 3790
tons for £9139. Since the start of things 435. per
share has been paid on 300,000 shares. At the
moment prospects in the deep levels, down to
2500 ft. vertical, are not encouraging. The co.
holds on to over £30,000 in cash, and owns a
share in the Burdekin crushing mill. The adjoining
New Brilliant Freehold has also worked out most of
the best stone downwards from the East Mexican’s
boundary to No. 3 level. In deeper country, No. 5
and No. 6 give some promise, but the reef isn’t so
rich as in the upper levels. Another old-timer, the
Brilliant and St. George, has secured a block claim
on the Moonstone line of reef. Unfortunately, the
Brilliant and St. George isn’t too well off, for its
half-year closed with a credit of only £2538, and
it isn’t every time that a prospector gets on to a
make of 3oz. stone so quickly as the New Queen
Cross did.
* * * *
Lass o’ Gowrie, Stannary Hills (N.Q.),
the best thing thereabouts, realised £4060 for its
crushing from the recently opened shoot of tin stone.
Heavy rains delayed the packers, or 40 tons of rich
ore would also have been sent to the mill. The
shoot, so far as it has been proved from the tunnel,
is 90ft. long, and some of it assays 40 p.c. oxide,
which means approximately 30 p.c. metal.
Briseis (Tas.) had a tally of 394 tons of
tin oxide for 1912. This is only 17 tons short of
the 1911 record, so Lindesay Clark has either had
even ground to treat or a bit in the sluice-box to
average with. The shortage was more than made
up by the higher range of prices, the average got
in 1912 being £215 Bs. per ton (metallic) against
£lB9 17s. 7d. in 1911. On top of these figures
dredging work at the Wallace leases (Vic.) gave
£47,989 of gold last year, or £16,000 more than
in 1911. The two yield a nice profit for the year—
probably over £50,000; sufficient, certainly, to pay
decent divs. and fat directors’ and engineers’ fees,
and to plant 100,000 shares in France or elsewhere.
Another resurrection. The Tasmanian
Hydro-Electric, which hit up against hard times a
while back, has found the springs of finance open m
London. £150,000 is being collected there to com-
plete the Great Lake works, give effect to associated
schemes, and provide working capital. The next
thing heard, doubtless, will be the electrolytic treat-
ment of zinc—if the cash doesn’t go in side-shows
before that problem is #
The Prince Alfred Tin Co. (Q.) re-
cently paid a div. of 10s. per share, allee same Mount
Elliott. The manager’s subsequent report states.

but the main reef has not yet been met. ’ It s always
like that when the ore in only 1* p.c.

usually found bland Chinese waiting to do a deal.
As time has gone on, the syndicates have become
satisfied that those bland Chinese know a thing or
two about the metal they have been handling all
their lives. There was the North Tambun, for in-
stance. On the Tongkah experience, lib. of oxide to
the vard would pay well; and here was anything up
to 31b A good manv of the people who were in
Tongkah sailed into Tambun cheerfully. A plant
was got at a cost of over £lO,OOO (the co. had paid

people who put their money into companies which
have paid a big price for the goodwill of a business
carried on in leased premises. It refers to Mel-
bourne —I don’t know what is happening elsewhere.
In that city I know of two mere cribs where, after
trifling alterations, tenants who had made the busi-
nesses were asked £5OO “ingoing” in addition to a 25
p.c. increase in rents. In another case where two
sisters had succeeded in working up a comfortable
trade in a crib in which two cats would be crowded,
the rent went up precipitately from £6 to £lO,
and cash to the amount of £5OO was extorted for
renewal of the lease. The girls were told that if
they did not pay the £5OO for their own business
somebody else would. There are other worse ways
of “sticking up” than the fine dramatic act of
prodding a gun-barrel under the victim’s ear and
demanding beans or berlud.

“D.X.”: (1) No value unless very handy
to a market; and the demand is limited, while the
supply in Australia is almost unlimited. (2) No;
they have a factory in Melbourne. .. .E.T.D.: A
fresh report from that Northern field leads to the old
conclusion —it is a legitimate gamble, though the
probable prize isn’t big enough to seriously outweigh
the risks of failure. .. .Copper Oouger: It’s a case of
doctors differing; and, knowing our own doctor,
we’ll take his opinions, without casting any asper-
sions on yours.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, Makch 31, 1913.
My Dear Arini, —
Up to the date of this writing, the only
member of the Dominions Commission who
had been captured by the lady lion-hunters
of Sydney was chairman Sir Edgar Vincent.
This noble prey was successfully stalked by
Mrs. 11. Osborhe for a race-week bun at the
Queen’s Club. Vincent probably has a taste
for tea-cakes in his hours of leisure, having
long ago nibbled society biscuits as a Lieu-
tenant in the Coldstream Guards.
Deep-laid plots to catch the elusive Rider
Haggard for women’s parties are floating
round our best suburbs. Every Mrs. Leo
Hunter is on the trail of his literary scalp,
in the hope of serving it up with shrimp
sandwiches some day shortly. No fair
huntress cares twopence about his rural
milkcans or his trade commissionership. But
the dame who first secures the writer of
“She” for an At Home (fourth or oneth
Thursday) will be an object of acrimonious
remark amongst her dearest acquaintances.
“How did she do it, my dear?” You know
the kind of green-eyed monkey that claws
the lesser huntsmen of the tribe when an
enemy has roped in a celebrity.
Our brand-new Governor had a busy race-
week, though he laid only one foundation-
stone. He opened the Flower Show in the
Town Hall with a few informative remarks
about Diocletian and his pet cabbage, ’way
down the centuries in Dalmatia. Mayor
Cocks and Minister Trefle answered back,
and the elegantly tailored limbs of Aide
Forbes hovered in the vicinity.
Saturday’s race meeting brought all the
winter furs out of their moth-balled hiding
places; and the black bear, the bright-eyed
squirrel, and the sly fox met a pleasant nip
m the breeze. There was ermine, too; but,
though the fur is worth almost its weight in
gold, the weazel is a most over-rated little
beastie. Now that the fashionable brand of
this sleek white pelt has lost all its black
tails, it might be a strip of white bunny at
20 yards range. Bunny would cost 20s. or
so ; the same area of ermine can run away
with £5O, and then look a very ordinary
wrap.
In fur, the best advertising line at Rand-
wick on Saturday was a spotted rug, worn
by Mrs. T. H. Kelly. It appeared to be
the remains of two long, lean leopards.
Worn like the skins in which an early
Briton clothed his body when the weather
was too chilly for woad, it swathed the Glen
Yarrah lady from neck to ankle or there-
abouts. This turn was the best on the
lawn.
Mrs. Forbes, wife of the A.D.C., is going
to set a pace for style and cherry-red cheqks.
She was one of the most dashing persons! to
be seen in the members’ stand the other day.
Her neck was well uncovered, with a cas-
cade of lace flowing in cravat-style over her
corsage. A black coat and skirt in some
fine silky material was ahead of anything
of its own species, but it was tame com-
pared with her black silk hat, a saucy
purple feather on the brim.
A. new bride, Mrs. Pilcher (who was Miss
Minter), dared the fierce glare of vivid
lime-green, which is Fashion’s pet color just
now, and beamed at her friends under the
shade of a hat plumed to match her gown.
The solitary ostrich plume, standing
straight up in front of the autumn milli-
nery, waves its bare pole with fronds out-
stretched like the limbs of ringbarked tim-
ber. The wintry smile of one of the Sugar
Knox ladies loomed under a conspicuous
example of these pluckings. The Very Rich
Miss Eadith Walker had quite a small ermine
garment round her shoulders. Compared
with a huge white rug of ermine worn by
a large lady in grey, the Concord milionaire’s
stole was a mere baby.
Melbourne sent us Mrs. Sep Miller, who
achieved some sartorial triumphs; and an-
other notable figure was the tall and hand-
some Mrs. • Monash.
Never before has the female head been
submerged in. such outrageous helpings
from the ostrich. Twenty guineas’ worth
of plumes nodded on the head of every
Perfect Lady who wanted to be considered
the thing at Randwick. A bushman, gazing
over the fence at the members’ stand on
Saturday, was evidently smitten with an
idea. “Let’s go home,” said he, “and . start
a feather farm, old woman—-there’s money
in it!” The trouble is to get the
birds. Certainly we have birds, but
the breeding is alleged to be very poor ; and
S’Africa boils you in oil before sending you
to gaol for 21 years if it finds so much as
a cracked egg in your outgoing luggage. It
has the trade, and it is going to take all
sorts of care to keep it.
Maize is the most delightful color of the
’tween-season modes. Some of the huge
tasselled plumes that writhed in .the breeze
at Randwick were in such delicate tones of
this sun-kissed tint that they looked like pale
reflections of some far-off Indian summer.
Mrs. Leonard Dodds, who is generally up
to the last gasp of Style, appeared at one
of the Easter crushes under a feathery can-
opy of this sunbeam shade.
George-street was mildly perturbed the
other afternoon by the appearance of the
tall, black-silk hat of the male-female species.
It had a long, white ostrich plume twisted
round its manly brim, and was worn by a
dashing person in a cream cutaway coat and
skirt. Whether the lady was a mannequin,
or walked about in this garb to please her-
self, I know not.
Governor Strickland got out his founda-
tion-stone apron on Saturday afternoon, and
did some brisk mason work at the new
Nurses’ Home attached to St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital. The walls are climbing up round four
sides of a square to enclose a lawn. Nests
of rooms run round the building, which will
be a two-storey affair, large enough to give
cool-storage to 80 nurses. St. Vincent’s,
with a present staff of 64 Nightingales, ex-
pects to soon expand to the 80; hence the
extra accommodation.
. Under the old, rough-and-ready system in
big hospitals, the weary trainee was dumped
into any old place at the end of her 12 or
14 hours of day-labor in the wards. She
slept (or stayed awake) under the worst
conditions, and crawled out of her shake-
down in the morning with as much alacrity
as a veteran snail. The public generally
responds with a business-like clink of cash
to any appeal that aims at the betterment of
such surroundings. In faith, trusting to good
works to hurry along, St. Vincent’s authori-
ties have therefore ventured on a debt of
about £12,500 on their Nurses’ Home. The
hospital, by the way, is built upon a rock
buried under garden mould, and so the founda-
tions of the new dove-cot have been chopped
from a home-grown quarry. Aide Dumaresq,
who remains on at Government House, and
keeps. the feet of the new Stricklands from
straying into danger zones, was the mous-
tache in attendance when the stone was well
and truly laid.
The new bud, Valerie Davenport, was in
the first flight at the Bachelors’ Hop on Fri-
day night. The blue puckered tunic on her
frock, which worked out an alluring varia-
tion on a main theme of deep mauve, was
It. And Molly Levy’s blaze of glittering
buckles on a foam of white drapery is said to
have moved less moneyed maidens to spasms
of envy.
A city damsel who nearly danced the soles
off her satin slippers at the Matrons’ Ball
last week, came away with feelings of in-
tense respect for the Sheep as a reliable
source of diamond necklets and pearl ropes.
Mrs. R. H. Dangar’s frock was one of the
events of the evening; it was purple dashed
with gold tissue. Mrs. Leslie Willsallen, one
of the best-looking young matrons present,
was clad in garments of gold shimmer, spark-
ling with a hoar frost of white crystal. The
roses used for the trimming of the ball-
room and supper tables alone cost Papa Mut-
ton a fat cheque; and then there was the
champagne that popped amongst the chicken
wings. The debutantes were Thelma Read-
ing, Millie Mort and another Society chick
whose bouquet was like a fall of snow.
Gold tissue at a guinea or two a yard is
one of the favorite extravagances of the
Fortunate Few this season. Silver tissue, a
milder outbreak, is its understudy for debu-
tantes’ plumage, where it is laid on in firm
knots, or made into the likeness of every
flower that blows. Camellias of this wiry
stuff stand out stiff and pale on gowns of
dead white satin.
The Burns-Mills wedding was one of the
most dressy episodes of race week. Miss
Vida Mills, the bride, is a daughter of David
Mills, of the Union Steamship Co., and the
’groom, Mr. Jim Burns, is the eldest son of
the Caledonian head of the Burns-Philp line.
The knot-was tied in St. Mark’s Church,
Darling Point. Limerick lace, which has
been featured for the last year or so as the
grand climax of every frilly weddinv, floated
over the bridal satin like white mist. Two
sisters of the bride were her attendant
maidens. The ’groom had Best-Man Jaques
at his elbow, with Venour Nathan as assist-
ant Help.
The Reginald Vaughans have been staying
in this town. She used to be the Mrs. Pren-
dergast whose clothes were the thing in our
most expensive circles. Mrs. Vaughan, whose
home is now 1 amongst the Welsh hills, re-
turns via the Cape on April 5. Her im-
mensely-attractive appearance hasn’t gath-
ered any signs of the flight of time since she
left these shores, so I suppose she has swal-
lowed the Elixir of Youth in regular doses.
The Gallic Fete in the Federation Hall
was opened by Miss Strickland, who per-
formed the official rites as deputy for her
mother. The results go to St. Pat’s parish.
A huge holiday crowd filed into Her
Majesty’s on Saturday night to see “Puss
in Boots.” The boxes were full of sleek,
prosperous-looking persons, the ladies very
decolleU, and the men very shiny in their
shirt-fronts. An osprey in one female
coiffure took a great curve over the hair
and fell down exhausted on the creases of
a plump white neck. Signs of the osprey
becoming extinct, by the way, are rather
feeble. Every other head the other evening
had a rakish plucking of the luckless white
heron waggling at an angle of 75 degrees
or so above the wearer’s French fringe.
George Miller, the Dame of the Panto.,
manages his skirts better than, most he-
dames, and gives a hurried lesson in the art
of cutting a dash in a doormat (used as a
muff), a striped tablecloth and an artificial-
flower-basket. Fred Leslie leaps through
the stage moon in Act I. to clasp the mus-
cular Ivy Schilling in a wild, whirling bal-
let in the Dame’s dormitory. The dance
has nothing to do with the moon or the dor-
mitory, but it gives a thrilling disnlay of
the Schilling’s unrivalled calves nnd white
lace petticoats.
Flower-trimmed dinner tables at horti-
cultural shows always lack one essential —
the dinner. Even a few knives and forks
would relieve the bleak acreage of white
damask and the hungry expanse between
tulle furbelows and tendrils of fern. But
there isn’t always much acreage to relieve.
Many of the floral dinner decorations that
snatch first prizes are worth the fourth or
14th Certificate of Demerit, for the simple
reason that they don’t leave space enough
to set a mustard pot between the vegeta-
tion. Another fault, even in the best decor-
ated dinner-table at the Sydney Flower
Show, was the height of the central orna-
ment. If you asked all your enemies to
dinner, and gave them nothing to eat but
asparagus fern and pink tulle, you would
naturally pile the flowers high in the middle
of the table so as to hide their infuriated
comments. But that really isn’t the pur-
pose of a dinner-table. Nevertheless this is
the stock first-prize type of decoration,
which has become a moss-grown tradition
at every horticultural rally this side of
the Garden of Eden. The pot-plant selection
was, on the other hand, a triumph, and this
year’s show made a record for its cactus
dahlias.
Pianist de Beaupuis flickered out rather
suddenly the other day, in the early fifties.
Heart trouble was the cause. The vital
spark had been burning dim in Sydney’s
great Italian music master for some months.
He tried to keep it aglow by a summer
holiday in Maoriland ; but the results were
disappointing. Nevertheless, onb r a day before
his death, De Beaupuis, whose charming per-
sonality won him stacks of friends, was chat-
ting so cheerfully to John Lemmone and other
old chums that the end seemed a long way
off. Of late years he had been heard less and
less on the concert ’datform. Essentially
a great teacher, he had the same grip on the
imagination of youth as had the late A. B.
Weigall, and his pupils were his faithful
disciples, trying to follow the master along
the track to faultless technique. He made
an unusually large income by teaching, but
he steadily over-taxed his strength. A big
gap in the teaching profession is the result.
Sweet singer Mary Conly stepped ashore
in Melbourne last week, had a glimpse of
her relatives, and hurried on to Sydney for
the Phil, concert on Saturday night. It is
two years since her silvery song was heard
in her native land. Since then she
has been hugging the shore of Sick
Bay in between big oratorio engage-
ments in Britain. The industrial un-
rest in 1911-12 in Bull’s Island affected
artists of every status. Mary Conly shared
with John Coates the uncertain joy of
being stoned from Sheffield to Heysham
during the railway upheaval. “The
strikers pelted the train we travelled in,
but we were lucky enough to reach the port
without any visible signs of the conflict.
We then embarked for the Isle of Man,”
says Mrs. Mary, “to fulfil a Sunday concert
engagement there. They were very sorry
to see us, for they had to pay us a stiff fee,
and there was no one to sing to, the trans-
port troubles having kept the summer
tourist away from Man. Manx cats, I
suppose, were the only performers in those'
troubled parts who were not worried by
the railway strike.”
Reginald Goode, formerly of these parts,
has joined F. R. Benson’s Repertoire Co.
at London Coronet Theatre. In a six-
months’ season Benson will produce ten
plays by Will Shakspeare, with a snack
from Goldsmith (“She Stoops to Conquer”)
and a modern poetical play, “The Piper,”
written by Josephine Preston Peabody.
After a month at the Coronet, the company
takes to the road and invades Glasgow,
Edinburgh and Hull, and winds up some-
where on the banks of the Avon to play
Shakspeare at the famous Stratford festival.
When Goode returns to Australia he ought
to be able to tell us what he really thinks of
Bacon.
Miss Hypatia Monk had to enter for the
motor-car reliability contest from Mel-
bourne, though Sydney is her native shore.
The Automobile Club in the Momma State
declines to take knowledge of the feminine
sex. So Hypatia crept into the motor-test
sprint between Melbourne and this port as
an applicant from the southern city. The
N.S.W. Club had firmly rejected her efforts
to join ; the Cabbage Patch, however, recog-
nises the fact that Woman in this continent
has never driven her car over anything
more alarming than an occasional fowl, and
could see no reason why she shouldn’t
plunge into petrol.
Australians abroad who have a day at
Naples, while their boat is alongside the
wharf, need to be wary of the hurried trip
to Pompeii. Tearing themselves away from
the City of the Dead, some of the drama’s
passengers patiently waited for the little
train that ought to have whisked them off
to Naples—and went on waiting till delay
looked serious. Two Italian officials were
vigorously interviewed in French and Eng-
lish by every other member of the party, and
were finally induced by the guide to say or
do something that would produce the ex-
pected means of transit. The chief official,
“the captain of the railway,” knew nothing!
and his assistant was equally well-informed’
When the train was due, no doubt it would
come. It was long overdue’ Tn
Still, when 1, came it would be
no more could be done in the mat-tar ’ m? d
travellers, thus comforted, rushed for a ? b °
adjacent derelict vehicles, while the V-T
shouted instructions to the drivers guide
“I tell you what, the ancient chariot rao*
was a funeral to our pace,” says one of th
trippers. “Standing up, the jehus
their nags into a furious gallop, while“Sr
chariots rocked from side to side, and 1
fell all over every inch of space in the bunm
mg machines. There were no fatalitiiT
though the- yelling of the excitable I talk’
drivers made us imagine that our frieoris
were about to be dashed to death just aheaH
of our own impending doom. When we eni
to the junction, where we caught a train
just in time to connect with the Orama wp
were coolly told that there had been a
collision, and no trains were running bevond
the junction that afternoon. So I give this
tip to Australians who go to Pompeii—take
no notice of Italian timetables, or, if you do
take also enough cash to pay your passage
by another steamer.”
Some recently-returned Australians re-
mark that the “roar of London” is becoming
a figure of speech. The vehicular traffic is
mostly shod with rubber tyres and silence
and after a mole-like descent into the tube’
the city man is whirled off to his evening
meal by stealthy underground tracks.
Black-and-white artist Fred Leist is said
to be looking very fit, and is up to his collar
in work in London. The Leists are settled
in a snug flat in Chelsea, where Art rages
round an annual poster-ball after its work-
ing overalls have been put to bed.
Fred Niblo’s broom work in “The For-
tune Hunter” show's some fine up-and-
down strokes. He’s the new young man in
Graham’s Drug Store when he seizes the
hard-worked domestic weapon and sweeps
a few clouds of microbes up against his
beautiful boots, or curls them up in a heap
beside the front counter. Graham’s store
seemed to be rather short of those dark
corners wherein even the Missus has been
known to hurriedly push the breakfast
crumbs pending an interview with the
butcher. Niblo has watched some woman
who’s been dead-tired of the sight of a
broom, and any married man who can
sweep as w'ell as he ought to take to it as
an early-morning appetiser these servant-
less days.
Captain Cross, R.A.G.A., has just returned
to these shores with his wife and youngsters
three. He has been slogging at the long
course at Woolwich, where gunpowder and
the latest tricks in machine guns are served
up in exam, papers. Queenscliff (Vic.) will
be his next anchorage.
Abbot Egan, 0.5.8., Ramsgate Abbey
(Eng.), is staying with his sister, the John
Toohey dame, at Wahroonga. The same
palatial nest also shelters Canon Keatinge,
of St. Augustine’s, Tunbridge Wells.
The Softgoods Sargoods, of Wahroonga
and York-street, have gone to Europe.
The Jim McMasters gave a decorative,
rose-trimmed dinner at the Australia the
other evening.
Robert Radford, who owns one of Eng-
land’s deepest bass voices, is said to be
turning- eyes of yearning towards Aus-
tralia.
Brjdge is burying the big musical At
Homes in London under tons of cards. The
Duchess of Doolittle would much rather win a
little money from her frieads at bridge than
lose a good round cheque to a professional
singer.
The cookery-class instructor gets some
joy out of life, though you mightn’t think
it.. One gleam came lately to a lady who
toils at the job in Riverina. The class-
maiden, who was making something alleged
to.be salmon patties, fell soliloquising; and
this to her was the conclusion of the whole
matter: “What’s the good, anyway? Men
are unappreciative beasts. You make nice
things for them, and they just come home
and eat them, and go out for the evening.”
Concerning some of the new domestic
treasures who add to the list of more or less
desirable immigrants, a North Sydney house-
mother drops in: “I noticed that our immi-
gration office treasure, invoiced as ‘cook,’
seemed to be taking in a large and increas-
ing supply of bread. ‘You have a good many
loaves there,’ I said. ‘Surely we don’t want
all that bread !’ ‘Oh, well,’ replied the god-
send, ‘I only take what the man brings in
his basket.’ ”
Newcastle has an amateur Operatic Soci-
ety which not only keeps out of debt, but tots
up its profits. Its first year’s balance-sheet
showed a credit of £395. Mr. J. Arthur
Wood and Keith Wood gave the warblers
their first financial push; and E. Vost Jans-
sen, Leslie Buchanan and Horace Campbell
fathered the infant prodigy.
Yours affectionately,
VANDGRLAN.
Why don’t the housebreakers and incen-
diaries of Australia emulate the society
ladies of Britain, and try to shorten their
sentences by hunger strikes? There seems
to be a lack of intelligent initiative on this
side of the globe.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, March 31, 1913.
My Dear Yaruie, —
The Bay gave a positively delirious wel-
come on Wednesday to the cruiser Mel-
bourne. Every fragment of floating iron in
the neighborhood swathed itself in bunting
and made tracks for the Heads. H.M.A.S.
Melbourne was inconsiderate enough, how-
ever, to arrive half an hour before schedule
time, thus filling the breasts of its would-be
greeters with that blind fury which the
suburban hostess knows when a guest arrives
to dinner well before the stated hour and
finds her hysterically washing the baby, or
disinfecting the pug, or performing some
other menial service. On discovering the
position, the welcoming fleet quite lost its
head. Small steamers, packed with Gov-
ernors’ Helps, bands, Government officials,
and more bands, scurried wildly forward,
but were unable to do more than bark feebly
at the heels of the speedy warboat ere they
fell hopelessly behind. I understand that
several of these craft became quite unstrung
with disappointment, and gibbered horribly
on the placid face of the waters.
Meanwhile, the Governor-General and
his Ministers lurked expectantly upon the
P l . er - llus fi that precedes an event of
b irst-Rate Importance brooded over the
scene. The ceremony, or parlor game, known
as the Official Call, was imminent. With
the expression of men bent on saving the
empire at any price, his Ex. and satellites
boarded the Encounter. Then the officers of
the Melbourne came down their gangway,
crossed the deserted pier, and formally in-
vaded the other ship. Rigid lines of brass-
mounted • officers and serge-gowned tars
gave an additional impressiveness to
the rite. The Melbourne officers pre-
sently went back to their boat. The G.-G.
and his following immediately pursued them,
blags waved and cannon boomed, and the
General Public (held within rope chains
on the pier) threw up its conglomerate and
dusty hat and hurrahed. The Return Call
was a complete and uproarious success.
I rime Minister Fisher and Senators Pearce,
ludor and Findlay were there; also Doctor
Maloney, displaying a furious red tie, an
excited air and a young, blue-clad daughter.
Mrs. Commandant Collins climbed aboard
the new warship in mole-colored velvet. She
owns one of the junior officers. Mrs. Sena-
tor Pearce, a handsome episode in black
satin, sat in her car at the foot of the gang-
way, and waited for hubby, with field-
glasses trained attentively on the ceremony.
With her was Mrs. Tudor, nattily tailored,
and pretty Mrs. Senator Findlav, smiling
under a white wreath of feathers and
wranned in a motor coat.
Lord Denman was nearly pushed into
the waters of the bay by the eager crowd,
but was saved from a dreadful death by (I
think) Aide Burnham. This warrior ex-
tended about 7ft. into the air, by
reason of a vast feathered hat. Talk-
ing of millinery, our latest thing in tars
has a lovely wide blue ribbon round his
face and under the chin, anchoring a very
upturned disc of a straw hat to the wearer’s
neck.
Minister-for-Defence Pearce dashed from
the Melbourne festivities on Thursday for
week-end speechmaking in Adelaide; thence
he goes on to Westralia for further election-
eering. Mrs. Senator Pearce has hardly got
over the fatigues of helping her husband
to help somebody else to turn the first sod
of the _ Transcontinental railway in W.A.,
so she is not accomna riving him this trip.
Altogether, Federal Ministers’ wives have
to get a move on if they are to keep pace
with their husbands. Mrs. Fisher had to
forego the Melbourne welcoming episode
altogether. She was too busy packing her
distinguished spouse’s things, preparatory to
a fresh trek to Bananaland.
Lady Fuller’s parting cup of tea at Ston-
mgton was an informal affair. Governor
Fuller, wearing an anxious smile, wandered
round and made disjointed remarks, whilst
the children sounded a domestic note by
tearing about with their golden hair a-hang-
ing down their backs. Her Ex. wore a
shantung suit (one of those costumes which
are plainly labelled “for active service on
voyage’’) and a black hat wreathed with
tired white _ blossoms. Others there were
Dames Whitburgh and Wrixon; Auntie
Phipps’ old pal, Mrs. General Kirkpatrick,
with Mrs. Parnell; the Mayoress, Willie
Watt’s wife, and Mrs. Norman Brookes—•
all wearing "loomy expressions on receiving
the final hand-pressure.
From “Rosna” in Foggyton:—
Tasmania’s new Governor has a wife, Lady Elli-
son-Macartney, who is a tall, dark, vivacious dame,
with considerable charm and remarkably little non-
sense. Of course, you know already that she is a
sister of the late Captain Polar-Seott. The whole
family is keen on out-door life, golfs, plays tennis
and' prefers to sleep in the open air. The three
young olive-branches, Phoebe, Esther and Jack, are
handsome, bright-eyed infants, ranging from 14 to
nine years, and as it is proposed to send them all to
school in the Apple Island, they are evidently not
to be kept in cotton wool or haughty seclusion.
The officers of the Melbourne went on
Thursday night.to Her Majesty’s to see “The
Chocolate Soldier.” Flags were hung in
banner fashion from the roof; also, they
stretched like small, bright bathing gowns set
out to dry round the base of the dress-circle
among the magnolia-covered electric lights.
The silver-headed Captain Mortimer l’e
Silver (who looks like Don Silva, of the
old-fashioned Italian opera, and might
easily be a descendant of that autocrat), sat
in the centre of the circle with the vice-
regals. The G.-G. looked seedy, but he
might have been merely bored. His lady
was wrapped in ermine, while a flighty
Lohengrin swan of diamonds raised its bril-
liant wings out of her hair. The hand-
some Barttelot lady looked like Undine or
a damp, green mermaid in a shawl of pale
sea -gr een that clung tightly round her.
Admiral Creswell’s lady drooped pensively
in a petunia-tinted cloak. Mrs. Defence-
Minister Pearce sat on Captain Silver’s
right, with pink roses in her hands and a
blossomy pink maiden at her side.
By the way, a couple of officers and their
lady friends, who arrived late, had appar-
ently been putting an enemy into their
mouths to steal away their discretion. After
high-jinks in the foyer, during which one of
the ladies, while climbing over some furni-
ture, was struck in a not necessarily vital
place by a naval cap aimed by a
flushed sea-dog, the party clattered to
their seats and started a hilarious
conversation. After a few words from
an usher, the deep bass of the chief male
offender was hushed, and the giggles of his
lady friends were heard no more. They
were not too joyful to be impervious to
hints.
With the sale .of the paternal acres at
Deniliquin, the Blackwood brothers will go
off the land for good, thus deliberately de-
priving themselves of a fruitful source of
lamentation. The criminal unreasonable-
ness and greed and avarice of shearers and
such-like has been their favorite topic of con-
versation for years. The place remains in
the family, however. The new owner is cousin
John Hunter Patterson. Of the three Black-
wood brothers, Bob, the eldest, is a shining
light on Dalgety’s (once Dalgety and Black-
wood’s) Board. He is also by way of being
a politician, having stood for the Federal
House, and actually occupied a seat therein
for some time. Pie is a good sportsman and
a popular clubman, and considers that the
Labor party should be boiled to death.
George—-bachelor and man of fashion —-
gravitates between here, Sydney and London.
He is supporting life in the Foggy place at
present. The youngest is there as a per-
manency.
The beauteous Irene Brown idealises
petunia in her 1912 costume in “Milestones.”
The pinky-purple frock clings affectionately
to her carefully modelled figure, and is
clamped in place with dull gold bands. When
she poses before the crimson glow of the
fireplace, re-living an old romance, the dress
is a fine complement to the dream. Crinolines
and surprised conversation about a new bath-
heater in the first act, give way to bustles
and a Japanese umbrella in the fireplace in
the second. The furnishings of the drawing-
room for the third generation takes its mod-
ernity from nothing so much as the black
satin cushions.
I hear from London that Dorothy (to her
intimates “Do-Do”) Ghenery, who left South
Yarra to stay with Mrs. George Chirnside,
has gone back to the stage. She is touring
with a “Milestones” company.
Somebody should take Molly Carew gently
by the ear and assure her that her future
doesn’t lie in monologue entertainment d la
Margaret Cooper, although she is doing
pretty well in that way at present. Molly,
with careful training, might develop into a
fine dramatic soprano, but her voice is not
really suited to saucy little songs such as
“I Wonder.” The other night, at the Athen-
aeum Hall, the best thing on the programme
was an absolutely unique rendering of the
old Miserere, from “Trovatore,” Molly sing-
ing the suffering heroine to her own niano
accompaniment, with Barker at the harp,
whilst Nap Boffard (in capital voice) hid
his warble behind the screen. She could
have put even more ginger into her vocal
work if she had been standing—and Molly
does know how to take the stage. But per-
haps it was better as it was. Her garb was
too extraordinary for full-length display—a
white satin skirt and a green smock, which
made her look like a flower pot trimmed with
crinkled paper. By the way, the baritone
of the co., Ambrose McMahon, has a big,
promising voice, and a painfully crude dic-
tion. In his Prologue to “Pagliacci” he ad-
dressed the women of the audience as
“lydies.”
Even if the weather didn’t remind us that
autumn is in close touch with winter here-
abouts, the outbreak of concert and recital
announcements would be warning enough
On Thursday of this week and on Tuesday
of next, William Murdoch (of whose playing
London Mokning Post said that it has the
personal note of the born musician) will give
piano recitals at the Athenmum Hall. An-
other Australian boy, Thorold Waters,
warbles upon the same platform on the
second and seventh. Violet Somerset, Rita
Hope and flautist Amadio give their joint
and several items at the Ath. on Wednesday
night week. Pianists Maggie Mather (at the
Masonic) and Edward Goll (Town Hall)
happen later in the month. The music
season has started rather earlier than
usual this year, the idea being to get in ahead
of the opening of Taits’ Auditorium in May,
with Clara Butt as the house-warmer.
The eastern side of Federal Parliament
House was in a festive mood on Easter Tues-
day, for Mr. Robert Mitchell, the official
keeper of that august building, had given his
daughter Ida in marriage to Charles Brad-
ish, and a large party was assembled to see
the heroine driven from Home. The wedding
had been performed in a swanky manner at
St. Peter’s, on the Hill hard by. Canon
Hughes, clad in gaudy vestments, was the
parson in command, and the bride, with two
maids in attendance, was followed to the
altar by a trailing white robe and veil. The
groom, Charles Bradish, is a young freelance
journalist, who graduated in an insurance
office, and retains a head for figures. It
seemed to be full of his bride’s as he escorted
her from the place of worship.
Geelong is convalescing after a violent
attack of tennis fever. One of the last
symptoms of the disease was a hop in the
Corio Club ballroom, ivy-clad for the
occasion. The squattocracy from the West-
ern District flooded the village, their women-
folk mostly staggering beneath ornaments
which gave a lift to the illuminations. Mrs.
President Hawks led the revels in a garment
of parrot-green. Mrs. Sherrard Warnock
chaperoned her big son and a daughter,
Mrs. Jack Lang, enticed from a far-off
station for this festivity. Frank Austin’s
handsome dame had under her wing Clair
O’Loghlen and nieces Doris and Poppy
Foster. In the Melbourne contingent an
artfully veiled study in delphinium blue,
enclosed Mrs. Gerald Buckland.
On March 26, Dr. A. H. Hughes and
Miss Blanche Goldspink were married. The
bridesmaids were fair and fluffy. They
numbered four —two sisters, a future sister-
in-law Hughes and Phyllis Verne. The
bridal party and about 50 others lunched at
the Grand Hotel, where aldermen made
speeches and brother-sawboneses said “Heah,
heah.” A brother of the bride, the owner of
a fine tenor, sang to them afterwards.
On Tuesday, the 25th, 30 people dined at
the huge round table of the Grand Hotel, in
honor of the Scawtch-Australian marriage
of Miss Katie Menzies-Burton and Mr.
Shillinglaw-Lilburne. Parson Dr. Marshall
presided. The decorations were something
extra. Electric lights were cunningly
muffled in scarlet wedding bells ; and heaps
of pink roses and belladonna lilies swamped
the table and flavored the soup and oysters
with pink petals.
Hamilton Russell is desolate, his capable
housekeeping sister having left for England.
In his despair, the unhappy doctor has fled
to a Cliveden bachelor flat. Does not your
heart go out in pity for him, my dear? He
is one of five doctors who, many years ago,
banded together and swore vows of celibacy.
The others have long since proved recreant.
But Hamilton still valiantly keeps the wolf
of matrimony off his doorstep. The last to
reneg was Dr. Stawell, who fell with a
deafening crash before the charms of a de-
lightful nurse.
Hal Waugh went back to Albury last
week, to resume the weary task of tutoring
his art scholars; but before leaving Mel-
bourne he arranged for a little show of his
charming water-color sketches in a Collins-
street bookshop. Waugh’s breezy studies,
showing the browsing and yarding of live mut-
ton and the putting of horses to agricultural
uses, are equally interesting and decorative.
They are bound to be snapped up at a
guinea or so apiece, and will help to advertise
the bigger pictures he intends to hang pre-
sently at the Athenaeum Gallery.
One of the best-known men in Melbourne
• —Harry Maddox, of the Argus advertising
dept.—is off this week on a long health and
pleasure trip to the hemisphere whence he
came 30 years ago.
Professor Symington, an anatomy special-
ist at Belfast University, is due to arrive
here next month. He will have a word to
say at the forthcoming medical congress.
Mrs. “Bazaar” Brenan is a cousin of his,
and so is ex-Ambassador James Bryce.
Charlie McEvoy’s two girls have been
enthralling the Sydney young men at the
Cup revels. The small dark maiden, in
particular, has been responsible for shrieks
of admiration. Their parent stayed at home
in Melbourne to mind the new flat.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Miss Heather Hammond, one of our most appre-
ciated amateur mummers, and Philpott Castle have
decided to take the more or less irrevocable plunge.
He is from England—from Blaekheath, to be ex-
plicit.'
Arthur Hughes, one of the Athelney clan, is also
plunging. His accomplice is Miss Lizzie Stevenson,
of Port Lincoln.
Miss Peacock and her sister, who have been for
some time in England, returned to us on Saturday.
Miss Mabel Dean was farewelled—more or
less—at the Queen Adelaide Club on Thursday after-
noon by her sister, Mrs. C. H. Angas. There was
none of that wild anguish which is observable when
the guest is off to Senegambia or Kamschatka
After her marriage, Miss Dean is going no further
afield than the Mount Lofty Ranges.
The Ben Hur co. contains a S. Aus. actress of
promise. Miss Lawrence is her name, and when her
people heard she was going on the boards they
simply yammered with dismay. However, she per-
sisted, and that is the sort of girl that succeeds.
The University students made pathetic asses of
themselves on Thursday. It is a little way they
have. This occasion was the reception of Moyes
and Kennedy, two ’Varsity boys who had been ice-
hunting with Mawson. Officials and relatives who
had foregathered at the station in time for the
arrival of the Melbourne express were brushed aside
by an avalanche of student, and the “returned
heroes were run in handcarts to the University.
The youths were attired in fearful and wonderfui
fancy dress, and raised Abel’s brother on their
way to the station and back.
The. Mount Lofty folk had one of the most poison-
ous nights on record for their dance last Thursday.
tt e Stirling Institute has no sitting-out places
Usually the revellers perch on one of the adjacent
fences, in default of a conservatory or other feature
of the typical Mayfair ball-room. To recline on a
lenee last week would have meant reclining on a
bed of influenza, or worse, 24 hours later. So no
one sat down anywhere. Nevertheless, it was a
jolly dance, and Miss' Helen Waterhouse, the secre-
tary, won the thanks of a lot of grateful guests
Racegoers on Easter Monday had a similar' ex-
perience. It stayed fine just long enough to lure our
unhappy women to array themselves in large and
drooping hats and the remnants of their summer
finery. By lunch-time it was raining hard, and the
language, my dear, was something awful. However
Secretary Von Doussa was philosophical. For one

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE PRESENT STATE OF NEW
SOUTH WALES.
Alfred Deakin says that to pass the Ref-
erenda is to sign a blank cheque giving the
Australian Parliament power to do what it
pleases. Well, what is the use of the neople
of Australia electing a Parliament if it can’t
do things? The Parliament of Britain, the
Parliament of Canada, the Parliament of
S’Africa, the Parliament of Germany, the
Parliament of France —all these have power
to do whatever they decide is best. With-
out such power a Parliament is a make-
believe. Deakin’s everlasting song is that the
people are being asked to sign a blank
cheque. He ignores the fact that the same
people have already signed blank cheques,
and given them to six State Houses, over
some of which they have no control what-
ever, whereas there isn’t a member of either
Federal House . who isn’t elected by .the
people and responsible to the people.
The present Defence System isn’t, after
all, Australia’s first taste of “conscription.”
A hundred years ago, when France looked
like a menace, Governor King didn’t worry
about the boys; what he did was to order all
the adult males of Sydney to send in their
names “for training in cannon, field pieces
and manoeuvres,” and followed this by an
order that they, as well as the male adults
of Parramatta and Green Hills, should pre-
sent themselves for enlistment. The men
were a mere handful, but they were in
earnest; and had a French man-of-war ap-
peared they would certainly have put up a
fight. There was at that time a corps of
British troops in Sydney, but these men
were officially guards over the convicts, and
were excluded from the citizens’ movement.
It’s a strenuous job trying to please every-
body. A few weeks ago, when, in the course
of the gas employees’ strike, the N.S.W.
Government issued a manifesto requesting
the citizens to aid the authorities in main-
taining law and order, it was denounced as
a panderer to the Property class. Then,
when the ferry strike was the current racket,
the Government’s efforts towards a fair
settlement were condemned because Car-
michael proposed such good terms for the
employees that, it was said, the workers in
various other industries were likely to
promptly fracture the peace of the com-
munity in order to gain similar benefits.
Of course, neither opinion was the genuine
view of the utterers; but it was confidently
hoped that the yell would be of some party
service in State politics. And where party
interest is involved, truth, honesty and fair
play are merely encumbrances.
WHEN THE. TROUBLE CAME.
The timely arrival of the Peace Society, with a
large supply of ammunition, saved the situation,
or. at least, what was left of it. —Memoirs of the
Defender of Port Darwin (1920 or thereabouts).
The very latest scheme for making the
soldier’s job compulsory in Bull’s country,
without making it compulsory, is that uni-
versity graduates should be refused the
degrees they have earned unless they join
the Territorial force. In other words, it is
suggested that the clever man who passes
his examinations must go a-soldiering, while
the dunce or drinker or waster who doesn’t
pass will be exempt. England is full of
complicated dodges and devices and shuffles
of the sort, but they produce few recruits,
and the Territorial force keeps dwindling,
and the plain, obvious method of compul-
sory service becomes more and more in-
evitable.
Good Lqrd deliver
us! A maiT who is
seeking a seat in the
Australian Parliament
in the Labor interest
has issued his appeal to
the electors of Northern
Tasmania; and this is
how he puts his claims :
“V ot e for Dashed
Blank —the man who
has worked in the pub-
lic interests for 20
years ; a director of the
butter factory, a direc-
tor of the Round Hill
mining co., president of
Agricultural Society,
president of Regatta
Association. The man
who secured better mail
services.” Not a word
of a platform or any
other such frivolity.
Dashed Blank may know
his constituency and the sort of thing that
is likely to appeal to it; but even so. matters
are not much improved for Dashed Blank,
who ought to be trying to get it to think
of Australian things.
If Labor gets back to: power after the
Commonwealth elections, Kink O’Malley and
Frazer will probably be out of the Minis-
terial team. The O’Malley has announced
that he wouldn’t take on the job 'again for
£lO,OOO a year, while the P.M.G. is tired
of office. The Caucus will not weep over
either loss ; the Kink’s flapdoodle has grown
boresome, and Frazer has not given his
important branch the attention it deserved.
Hon. Minister Roberts and Findley are
marked out for the vacancies, with Fenton
(who ejected Mauger from Maribyrnong)
as a new unsalaried Minister.
Deakin positively froze the iced gold-top
at the recent Sydney Chamber of Commerce
feed when he put the situation this way :
You are simply being asked to hand over (at the
Referenda) the 'powers sought in order that the
majority in Parliament for the time being may
have an unlimited control over the possessions, the
propertv, the rights, liberties and activities of the
people ‘of Australia. If you desire that, well and
good. But it would be absolutely disastrous to the
effective controlling of the Commonwealth.
It makes one pity the unfortunate people of
Britain. Their Parliament has “unlimited
control” over everything within the United
Kingdom, and if, as Deakin alleges, the
more power a country’s Parliament pos-
sesses, the more “disastrous” it is for the
country, then Britain has so much “dis-
aster” that there shouldn’t be any Britain
left. Has anybody seen the fragments of
Britain lying around loose anywhere?
From Deakin’s recent anti-Iteferenda
harangue to Sydney Chamber of Commerce:
What they (Deakin’s opponents) want is undefined
authority. They would give no thanks for clearly-
defined authority. There was no attempt to define
the powers when they were dealing with your pro-
perty, your taxes, your land, your means of liveli-
hood. How do you fancy the prospect of giving
powers without defining them ? How can you
shelter yourselves against powers deliberately un-
defined ?
Deakin’s craving for “defined powers” is
humorous —or tragic —in the light of his-
tory. Deakin was one of the principal arti-
ficers among the builders of the present Con-
stitution, and, presumably, he was satisfied
that the Federal powers were properly “de-
fined.” But when, later, the High Court
bumped out the Union Label clauses in the
Trade Marks Act, to say nothing of other
legislation which Deakin passed under the
poweys which he himself had helped to “de-
fine,” Deakin’s stock as an authority on
“defined powers” went down with resound-
ing Costs that echo in the Treasury even to
this day.
“Quidam” : There is rather a subtle point
about the Initiative Referendum arrange-
ment in Victorian municipal affairs. If a
council decides on a loan, and some of the
ratepayers are against it, a referendum can
be demanded, but in this referendum only
adverse votes are taken. If these total one-
third of the number of ratepayers on the
roll, the proposal is quashed. The one-third
must: obviously be live, energetic ratepayers
who actually vote, whereas the roll may
contain the names of many who are dead or
gone away, or too lazy to have any opinions.
Consequently to obtain an apparent one-
third, the objectors must put up consider-
ably 1 more than one-third the actual avail-
able votes of the municipality. A fairer
method would be to make both sides vote
instead of counting everyone who doesn’t
vote as an affirmative. The assumption that
a dead ratepayer would always say “Yes”
appears to be arbitrary and unreasonable,
lie might say “H —1.”
THE TIME TO ACT ,
If the Liberal party was returned to office it would
legislate to deal with those trusts and combines in
such a way as to prevent them sucking the blood
from the people as they are doing in America at the
present time. — Liberal candidate Fuller, after deny-
ing the urgency of the Referenda demands.
VOICE FROM ASHORE : "Hi! If you engaged
me as boatman I reckon I’d make a better
fight than Unde Sam’s doing!”
OWNER OF THE BOAT: "Hmp! I was just think-
ing it might be better not to wait till it
came to such a point, but to settle the
matter now.” ( The picture in the top-storey
shows Uncle Sam—when the time is quite
RIFE —in the act of "dealing with those
trusts and combines in such a way,” etc.)
THE BUILDING-UP MANIA.
At the close of the last financial year the public
debts of the Commonwealth Governments amounted
to £279,676,931. of which £273,305,084 was the
liability of the States and £6,371,847 that of the
Commonwealth.
UNK: "Dere now! Don'd id make ye veel
ashamed to see how dose tiddle chaps hat
risen oter you?”
It looks as though Labor is going to again
make the blunder of not opposing Cook in
Parramatta. Yet a good candidate, with a
personality, could shake up the renegade
badly, and, if he could not defeat him, could
anyhow keep him verv busy in his own elec-
torate. The joke is not popular in Parra-
matta, where scores of otherwise staunch
Tories declare that, if they cannot bring
themselves to vote Labor, they will at any
rate not vote against it for fear of imperil-
ling the Defence Scheme —a valuable thing
which they admit Joe Cook is not to be
trusted with. Also, Cook’s continued infer,
ence that there are no Trusts or Combines
raising the cost of living are exasperating,
lie never outlines anv Liberal plan of action
against the Trusts, but contents himself by
sneeringly remarking that without Trusts
Hughes would have no occupation. Sneers
never won an election yet. The Labor
party had hoped to get Shannon, of the
Sugar Commission, to stand against Cook,
but he withdrew, and no other suitable man
has yet* been dug up.
The other day Westralia
gave birth to a weird in-
fant, which was subsequently
baptised the Country Party.
The convention of midwives
who superintended the in-
teresting event provided the
infant with a raft of 13
planks to float on —freehold
tenure of land (as much
land as ever one can grab) ;
immigration (cheap, for
choice) ; vigorous railway
construction (at the next
generation’s expense) ; bulk
handling of grain (at ditto) :
better facilities for disposal
of produce (Socialism for
ourselves, Anti-Sosh for
everybody else) ; utilisation
of natural ports (hooray!);
irrigation (so that the land-
shark close in need not be
disturbed) ; extension of
agricultural education
(hooray again, if they need
it) ; Freetrade ; opposition to
arbitration as regards rural
producers (in other words,
opposition to a fair thing in
the rural industries) ; pay-
ment of a fair day’s wage to
persons employed in primary
industries (the “primary
producer” to sav what is the
fair thing—no mere Judge or
outsider trusted) ; compulsory preferential
and postal voting; and economical admin-
istration of Government departments. Big-
john Forrest, on being asked to express his
oninion of the malformed kid, gave it his
blessing, and said he saw nothing in its
platform antagonistic to the Liberal League
—which is the nastiest thing said about the
Liberal League to date!
Charles Gregory Wade, leader of the
N. S. Wales remnant of the party which
the distracted Deakin is fleeing from, ao-
pears to be down and very nearly out by the
sound of the kicks he is getting. This is
the contribution of Briner, M.L.A. (“Lib-
eral”) :
Ministers of the Crown may be only “painters,’
or “boilermakers,” or “miners,” but all men in
public or private life should be above personalities
and mean tactics towards opponents or friends. And
from leaders in public life we should expect a hum
standard all round. I did expect this from Mr.
Wade, but I have been disappointed.
Briner has this much satisfaction he is
disappointed in the company of nearly the
entire congregation.
THE CITY SACK-SMITH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. Maloney, M.H.R., yesterday introduced a de-
putation which waited upon the Minister for Home
Affairs, Mr. King O’Malley, with regard to the ques-
tion of the unemployed. The president of the
Trades Hall stated that they represented 4000 un-
employed in and around Melbourne. If it were
necessary to prove this, names and addresses could
easily be given.— News item.
Beneath the ring-barked Fusion tree
The stout Protrader stands ;
A large, inflated windbag he
With Hansard in his hands ;
And the muscles of his bulging cheek
Are strong as iron bands.
His hide is thick, his speech is long,
His ears like door-mats fan;
His brow is wet with Judas-sweat;
He lies whene’er he can;
He is the Fusion candidate —
Likewise the Labor man.
Week in, week out, from morn to night,
I hear these creatures blow;
The land is filled with Fusion skite
And Labor’s jawbones go ;
The welkin welks whilst imports swell,
And exports dwindle low.
The workless spurn the Fusion fool, '
And then observe next door
The Labor windbag, stout and cool—
He lifts Freetection’s roar.
The People is a long-eared mule —
’Tis hitching-time once more!
Fat sits complacent on his perch,
No jarring note annoys ;
He cheers Freetection’s Fusion speech.
And Protrade Labor’s voice.
The working man is out of work,
And it makes his heart rejoice.
yiCTORIA.
He hears Joe Cook’s and Fisher’s tones
Upraised in Paradise,
And sinks Smith’s job to Davy Jones,
Submerged ’neath merchandise;
And with his fat, smooth hand he-boosts
His profits to the skies!
From distant lands his steamers bring
Boots, hats and clothing, hose;
He hears the wharfside winches swing,
And damns the workers’ woes.
The City sack-smith is the king
No candidates oppose.
Thanks, then, to him this rapid trend
Towards Cohen’s famed resort;
Whilst Labor man and Liberal spend
These months in platform sport,
Make speeches, caper, joke no end,
Smith’s wife and kids go short!

INDIGESTION AND BILIOUSNESS.
SURRY HILLS RESIDENT BENE-
FITED BY DR. MORSE’S INDIAN
ROOT PILLS.
-Two of the commonest, yet most distress-
ing, complaints from which people suffer
are Indigestion and Biliousness. The fol-
lowing case of Mr. P. Brien, of 31 Collins-
street. Surry Hills, Sydney, illustrates how
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills speedily re-
lieve these attacks, and restore the system
to health. .. . _
“For about IS months,” writes Mr. P.
Brien. “I have suffered with Indigestion
and Biliousness, and during that time I
have tried various remedies, but none are
on the same level as Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, which I tried, and a few weeks
after was restored to perfect health again.
I can recommend them as a sure cure for
Indigestion and Biliousness, and you have
my full permission to use this for adver-
tising purposes.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The statement that £30,402 was distributed
in four days at Randwick sounds fine and large, but
like the half-crown the old lady offered the press at
the police court to keep her son’s name out, there
was a terrible crowd to divide it among. In spite
of his bad break on Saturday, Cadonia got away
with the lion’s share for Mr. Birk, his share being
£4978 for Sydney Cup and second place in the
A.J.C. Plate. “Lucky” Connolly, of Westralia, w_j
second with £3495, which Jolly Beggar brought
him out of the Doncaster and the All Aged Stakes.
Radnor secured £2323 from the Sires’ Produce
Stakes for Mr. Earnshaw. There is a drop then to
the £l9Bl secured for Mr. W. Brown by Piastre in
the Autumn and Cumberland Stakes. After that it
tails away from the neighborhood of a thousand
pounds down to a modest £3O.
* * * *
Tbe arrival of Barios on tbe last day of
the A.J.C. Autumn meeting was an interesting
sight. The son of Grafton opened at threes, but
when Judas O’Noses saw the rush of the public the
price began to harden with record speed. Golden
Hop and Tartanus were begging at fives and sixes,
and anything from 10 to 100 to 1 was to be had
against the rest of the field, which numbered 10.
Tartanus went out and made the pace a cracker
from the jump, and at six furlongs was going great
guns well in advance, while Barios seemed to have
taken on the job of driving the rest home. At the
half-mile Barios was third. Then Tartanus went to
pieces, and Barios, unwinding himself, sailed home
with apparent ease, four lengths to the good, Tar-
tanus beating Leta for second place.
Of a field of 40 listed for the Place Handicap
only seven were left in, and the public loaded its
swag on Jacamar at 6 to 4 against. Hallowmas
started at 6 to 1 against, but at the first sign of
backers the price promptly hardened to threes.
Noses O’Judas is a business man and not a sport.
Jacamar started well, and when entering the
straight was close to Lochano, who was leading.
Then he suddenly faded out. Hallowmas came with
a great rush, and it rested between Lochano . and
Hallowmas. Not that the latter had any great
hope, for entering the last furlong he was nearly
three lengths to the bad, and Lochano was going
strongly. But the mare suddenly tired, and Hallow-
mas had no difficulty in heading her and winning
with three lengths to spare.
The great race of the final day was, of course, the
A.J.C. Plate, the three-mile tussle for 1500 added
sovereigns. There was a field of only six, and pro-
viding he felt that way, it was a gift_ for Cadonia.
The books flatly refused to give more ’than 6 to 4,
and some wouldn’t give that; others thought the
uncertainty of Cadonia’s temper was good enough
to bet on. Aurofodina led the way for two and a
half miles, and then the three-year-olds put in an
appearance. Whether this exasperated Cadonia or
not is hard to say, but he suddenly started to .move
in real earnest, and the way he wiped out the
difference was proof of what would happen if he
didn’t change his mind or stop to scratch his ear. -
He did change his mind ; but his jockey fell on him
with whip and spur and moral suasion, and he
changed his mind again. He came away beautifully;
but once more he suddenly thought better of it,
and, in spite of the frantic efforts of the jockey,
who used hands, heels and tongue on him, the brute
declined to pass Harpist, and was content to beat
Aurofodina for second place. The only thing to do
is to apply an electric shock in the right place at
the right moment, and then the cranky animal
would probably get level with his tormentors some-
how.

Oakbank, in the hills behind Adelaide, had
its usual once-a-vear race success on Easter Monday.
The crowding by road and rail from the city was
tremendous, but at lunch-time the day set in wet,
and sent ever.vbbdy home soaked. The £lOOO Great
Eastern Steeple went to the Mount Gambier district,
Sinclair’s Tramp winning easily ; and Keith Bowman’s
Greek Fire was a good thing for the Cup. In all,
£32,000 went through the totalisator, but big divi-
dends were lacking.

“F.C.” : Let me make a few insulting re-
marks in reply to “0.K.” (B. 20/3/’l3) in the mat-
ter of Flemington Flat. As far as I am aware, no-
body expected or wanted the V.R.C. to provide “free
race-going”; what is protested against is the im-
pudent job of handing over to a select body of well-
to-do persons, mostly Tories, for money-making pur-
poses, a valuable slice of the people’s property.
“0.K.” says the money of the Standites and Hill-
ites “provides the entertainment wh ; ch the Flatites
have been seeing for nix all these years.” Now will
“0.K.” tell us exactly what entertainment a Flatite
sees? Has “0.K.” ever been ort Fleminvton Flat?
Absolutely the only entertainment the Flatites get
is what they provide themselves. Most of them go
there to bet. A few go merely for an outing, a pic-
nic—to see the crowds. The man who wants to see
the races doesn’t waste his time on the Flat. As
well look for a glimpse of the distant ocean from a
deep gully. And of late years the bettors on the
Flat have paid their share to the cost of the enter-
tainment, per Ikey Moses’s license fees. Says “0.K.” :
“Flemington on race days is a gaming-place, and
the legislators of Victoria ought not to have licensed
a racing club that gave free admission to impecuni-
ous punters.” Ho! But it is quite right for the
said legislators to hand over gratis to the racing
club the property of the impecunious punters, as
well as that of citizens generally, including Wow-
sers. As a matter of cold fact, Flemington race-
course should never have been handed to the Y.R.C.,
but should have been under control of trustees, just
as the Metropolitan Cricket Ground is; and as to
the Flat, the V.R.C. has no moral right—even if it
is given the legal right—to charge one penny ad-
mission thereto, for it gives nothing in return, and,
in the nature of things, never can.
If there is to be a continuance of the
policy of rich prizes for w.f.a. races at Randwick
and Flemington, the authorities should at least take
measures to mitigate the preposterous inconsistency
(in most cases) of w.f.a. form with handicap ditto.
Let there be an end to the old gag that a good per-
formance in a w.f.a. race is not necessarily an indi-
cation of a horse’s ability to shine in a handicap
race, as though there were some subtle difference
between the sorts of galloning required for the twc
events. It is this old newspaper gag which provides
stewards with their only visible excuse for nevei
holding an inquiry into reversals of form as betweer
w.f.a. and handicap conditions. Such reversal!
happen rarely, if ever, in the case of the top-
notchers who are to win everything thev go for. A
Carbine, whilst capturing the rich w.f.a. stakes oi
his time, scores wins in a couple of Sydney Cups, i
Melbourne Cup, a second in an Australian Cun am
Melbourne Cup, and a third in a Newmarket Hand!
cap. Lord Cardigan, Wakeful, Trafalgar and others
can be quoted as evidence that first-class form holds
good under all racing conditions. To come down
to the present day, the running of Piastre in handi-
caps has been consistent with his w.f.a. form. But
with many notable racers there was never any con-
sistency. They never had full steam up in any
w.f.a. gallop that happened just previous to a big
handicap. Therefore, w.f.a. form is misleading, in
so far as it is dishonest; and clubs that offer
rich prizes for these nominal test races should make a
respectable endeavor to purge this evil and ensure
a fairly honest all-round run for their money.

There is a lovely stir-up in S. Aus. row-
ing circles over the recent development of oarsmen
on the Murray. The club at Murray Bridge, having
done itself handsomely at recent regattas, has chal-
lenged the eight—of City men, as usual —chosen to
represent the State, and has been given a date.
To that the eight replied by resigning in a body
and refusing to row anybody anywhere, and the
whole businesses in a state of flux.

The luck of Sydney fight-followers was
dead out on Saturday night, when Wenand proved
quite unable to hold up his end against George
Taylor. Wenand was suffering from stage fright,
blue funk or something, and the ability to time a
blow left him absolutely. Mostly he seemed to be
content to be a chopping block, but occasionally he
would rage round with a shower of blows, most of
which failed to arrive within the neighborhood of
the party they were presumably intended for.
Generally, however, the dazed youth stood still and
allowed Taylor to practise fancy wallops on his
various parts. Still, if Wenand’s self-possession had
evaporated, his physical courage and stamina had
not, and he took his punishment like a Trojan. As
soon as the real state of affairs became apparent,
referee Scott stopped the affair (it couldn’t be
called a contest) and awarded Taylor the victory in
the fourth round. The pair were recommended to
the Stadium by some Melbourne people who have
hitherto had the reputation of being good judges.
Wenand is said to have put up some good scraps in
the southern city, and the only explanation is that
he suddenly became stricken with a hurricane at-
tack of general inability. The man was obviously
not himself. Nobody who acted as he did on Satur-
day night could ever have got a second fight if that
were his general demeanor.

Jack Read, the ex-Tasmanian boxer, went
for a walk round Brisbane Stadium on Saturday
night with Joe Russell, a resident lightweight.
Russell’s chances did not look too rosy, as Read
• was 91b. heavier and a head taller. Read com-
menced with a display of beautiful boxing, which
was slightly interrupted in the second round by
Russell very coarsely knocking out two of his
teeth. However, Read went on piling up the points
by elegant boxing till the end of the fifth. There-
abouts Russell shook himself, and got a move on.
He became somewhat more elusive, and for five
rounds the thing was very even. Then Russell at-
tacked in great style with straight lefts and right
swings which found Read’s head repeatedly, and im-
proved neither" its clarity nor its appearance. At
the end of the bout Referee Craig said Russell had
won on points, and a number of the audience cast
aspersions on his judgment; but he, being in
authority, ignored such trifles, and Russell collected
the winner’s end of the gate.

As expected for some months, New York
has ukased that there shall be no more fights be-
tween white and colored men in Gotham and the
parts adjacent thereunto. So Johnson’s last hope
of getting a match in the place where he has longed
to fight fades out. Curiously enough the popularity
of the Commission’s decision largely rests on the
fact that it biffs Lil’ Artha right out. Johnson
always swore that if he were discriminated against
personally, he would make a constitutional case of
it, and the threat seemed to impress the Commis-
sion. But, after hesitating, it made a sweeping
rule and chanced the ducks.
Still, Johnson seems to get gilded fights
in spite of the N’York Commission’s attempts to
come to a reciprocity arrangement with the Parisian
promoters. The Cirque de Paris has offered him a
fight with Luther McCarty for the world’s cham-
pionship provided terms can be arranged. Before
his Sable Nibs had time to open his gold-lined
head, Luther bawled that he would take £6OOO as
his share, win, lose or draw; or he would take 30
p.c. of the gate, provided it yielded him not less
than £6OOO. Johnson is giving the Parisians time
to recover their wind before he speaks. It is reck-,
oned that the gate would be worth £20,000 —and’
Luther regards Johnson as being so hard up for a
fight that he will accept any reasonable terms.
Which, of course, was his chance to be unreasonable.

Silas Bevan strolled into Sydney Sports
Ground from Gunning (N.S.W.) on Saturday after-
noon, and startled the athletes. He was after the
High Jump Championship of N.S.W., but did not
seem disposed to go to much trouble to get it, and
jumped with his hat on. The bar was at sft., and
Silas, with his hat on, hit it. “Wait till he takes
off his hat!” said someone who knew him. The
lid being removed, Silas soared over the bar with
ease and grace. At sft. sin. Maher, the tall police-
man with legs like a kangaroo, retired and left
Bevan and Scott to fight it out. At sft. IOUn.
Bevan got over in his second attempt and Scott in
his third. Up went the bar another inch, and at the
very first attempt Silas flew over it like a bird,
with inches to spare. Scott failed absolutely, and
Silas Bevan, Of Gunning, unheard of till that after-
noon, was Amateur High Jump Champion of N.S.W.
and the dependencies thereof.
The Motor-Car Reliability Test from Syd-
ney to Melbourne came to an end on Saturday. Of the
19 who ran through, the first to pull up at Melb. Hay-
market was A. V. Turner (N.S.W.) who arrived at
2.47 p.m.; but when the various points were worked
out, the winner turned up in W. R. Glasson (Cum-
nock, N.S.W.), whose Talbot scored a clean sheet in
reliability, petrol consumption and hill-climbing.
That is to say, he ran over the 572 awful miles be-
tween Sydney and Melbourne without losing a point.
His nearest competitor, G. F. Hill, also drove a Tal-
bot, and lost only 22 points. Third and fourth
places were filled by Vauxhalls driven by Leslie Pye
(Parramatta) and Boyd Edkins (also N.S.W.). In
fact, N.S.W! scored the first ten places in the final.
The only lady competitor, Miss H. Monk, was
second last, and managed to keep only 664 of the
900 points she started with. It is said that com-
petitors thoroughly enjoyed the outing, but the
writer cannot understand it of anyone but a man
interested in sales or repairs. Only two cars dropped
out, one owing to a broken front-axle, and one through
the sudden illness of its owner. The test has cer-
tainly proved that the modern car is a wonderfully
reliable machine, but it seems the sort of proof that
one would rather collect from the experience of
people he is not over-friendly with.

Lacrosse threatens to be a formidable
rival of football in Sydney this winter. In the
first grade, nine teams will struggle with the onion
net and the small ball, while ten entrants will cause
turmoil in the second grade. An effort was made
to push the electorate system into the game; but
the club interests were too strong, and the old per-
nicious system will rave for another year.
* * *
Amateur boxing and wrestling badly re-
quire organising in N.S.W. In every other sport a
competitor in the annual championships at Sydney
has to be a member of a recognised or affiliated
club. In boxing and wrestling there is no such
provision. Anybody can nominate, and as the
N.S.W. Sports Club has.but little means of checking
the statements of applicants, it has virtually got to
accept as gospel whatever would-be competitors like
to declare to be true. Probably most of the men
are genuine amateurs, but occasionally there are
rumors ; and, anyhow, the position is unsatisfactory.
The only remedy would appear to be the establish-
ment of district boxing clubs, affiliated with the
Sports Club, who would be able not only to afford
better supervision, but also to encourage healthy
exercise in country towns and districts. Wanted,
an organiser! # #
Saturday saw the resumption of big
cricket in Sydney and the conclusion of the 12th
round, commenced away back on March 15, and cut
in two by the early arrival of Easter. When play
ceased a fortnight before, North Sydney was in a
hole, Balmain having knocked up 312 runs for
eight wickets. The rest lifted the score to 346, and
then started out to put North Sydney through in
the quickest possible time. North, of course,
struggled to keep its wickets up till time should
run out, and so make a drawn game. By dint of
solid stone-walling, this was done; when play
stopped only seven wickets were down, and though
there were but 162 runs on the board, defeat had
been avoided. Fortunately for North Sydney, Red-
fern, the nearest competitor, struck trouble with
Glebe, being defeated by 55 runs on the first in-
nings. So North’s position at the head of the com-
petition is unimpaired. Had Balmain won, as it
seemed almost certain to do, and had Redfern over-
thrown Glebe, things would have been different.
University, the third on the list, was too far away
to be dangerous, but it improved its position, and
drew level with Redfern by overthrowing Burwood
by 112 runs on the first innings. For the rest, Gor-
don downed Paddington by 128 runs on the first
attempt; Sydney crawled out on top of Central Cum-
berland at Parramatta by five runs (239 to 234)
at the first time of asking; and Petersham fell to
Middle Harbor by 147 on the first call, the figures
being 381 to 234. University played a great game,
and, thanks to Barbour’s carrying his bat for 135,
was able to close the innings with 256 for fiye
wickets. Another century-getter was Rix, of Red-
fern, who smacked 113 before he was caught by
Gorry off Cotter. The latter astonished the natives
by doing the hat trick. The position in the Com-
petition is— North Sydney 17 points, Redfern and
University 14 each, Burwood and Gordon five each,
Central Cumberland none, the rest below zero.
By reason of the damp pitches, Melbourne’s
senior cricket, on Saturday, was confined to the con-
clusion of the game between North and P’ran. The
latter had a chance of reaching the finals if it could
beat North outright; as it was, North compiled 172
and P’ran replied with 109, wherefore P’ran’s light
was snuffed out. The four leading teams —’Roy,
’Wood, South and ’Varsity—will now argue the
point.

While the seniors were thus standing
abashed before the floods of Heaven the Junior Final
was being' l fought out, on a matting wicket, by ’Roy .
Footballers C.C. and Middle Park. The ’Bailers
have scored 175 and 202, and Park has made 100 at
its first try, so its chance looks about as rosy as the
late Mr. Buckley’s. A feature of this game was the
keen barracking interest taken by the spectators.
So far, the “gate” has yielded £l5O, which is par-
ticularly healthy for a junior game.

Tasmania has had its annual cricket up-
heaval between North and South. Hobart went
north to Launceston, and showed small respect for
hospitality by jumping on its hosts with five wickets
to spare.

In an A grade senior cricket fixture, South
Brisbane (premiers) v. Toowong, the scoring sheet
last Saturday had a queer look. The brothers E. K.
and W. A. Armstrong (Toowong) took every wicket
between them—-E.K., seven for 66 ; W.A., three for
71.

Adelaide Register has been collecting the
impressions of Charlie Checkett, groundkeeper and
turf-doctor of Adelaide Oval ever since Jesse Hide
gave up the job away back in 1883., He makes his
pitch of a local (Athelstone) soil; he has one wicket
of Bulli, but finds it too fiery for the climate. The
cricket area is six acres; and there are tennis, cro-
quet and bowling greens at the back. Checkett had
11 courts going for the tennis tournaments lately;
the Melbourne visitors pronounced them the best
they had seen, and a purse of sovereigns went his
way at the finish. He gives his views on cricket
with freedom, and some of them are surprising. He
thinks Maclaren the greatest batsmen. that ever was.
Palmer the best bowler, Giffen the best all-round
man (Crawford is at present), Lyons the biggest
hitter, and Smith (Warwickshire) the best wicket-
keeper, “although Blackham and Lilly white were
exceptionally good.”

“Konini”; It seems likely that the con-
trollers of the Rugby League game in N. S. Wales
will come under the displeasure of the Anti-Monopo-
list Act—or it would if Australia was not, so ad-
dicted to the monopoly curse that it lies down to it.
With the oof bird as partner, they have pushed the
Rugby Union off the Sydney Cricket Ground for this
season, and the Australian game from its old home
on the Erskineville Oval. The Union players of the
top grade have still the Universitv Oval, but the
crowd that indulges in the national code will have
to conduct their arguments on the gateless Moore
Park. And, unless the voracity of the League for
playing grounds is appeased, the “Soccer” fraternity
will have to let its enthusiasm overflow on the main
streets of Pyrmont and Balmain. Boodle is mighty
and will prevail whether it be the boodle of a Sugar
Trust or a Distended Bladder Combine.

Maoriland Rugby Leaguers will have a
team in Sydney early in June; somewhere about 24
men will be sent over, representing practically the
whole of the Dominion. League Rugby is nothing
like as flourishing in Maoriland as it is in Sydney;
but, all the same, its plavers make a formidable
crowd. The visit of the Sydney team to the Shivery
Isles last season did a lot to bring about a revival,
and the early despatch of this team to Sydney will
do a lot more.

Practically every craft of any racing pre-
tens:ons in Sydney Harbor turned out on Saturday
afternoon and did its bit to make an attractive dis-
play for the Walter Moore benefit fund, the whole
of the proceeds to go to the widow and family of
the late mainsheet hand of the Thelma. Clark
Island was the centre of attraction, being the finish-
ing mark for most of the events. The P.A.Y.C.
ran off two events, one for the A class (10 metres and
over), the other for the B class (under 10 metres).
The A class consisted of Culwulla 111., Sayonara
and Rawhitu Thelma would have been in that sec-
tion had she been here, but Thelma is beneath the
waves. Rawhiti was scratch, and conceded Cul-
wulla four and Sayonara six minutes. Passing
Bradley’s Head the extras were crowded on, and the
yachts made a magnificent picture as thev flew for
Manly, where Sayonara was in charge, followed bv
Culwulla. On the thrash back to Shark Island Cul-
wulla began to close on Sayonara and Rawhin *
overtake the pair of them. At Fort Deniscm hT
distance between the three still further decreain
and it went on decreasing until, at the finish th
was only lmin. between the three. Culwulla S
from Sayonara, which managed to beat Rawhiti fn
second place. But it was close—very close indeed
Seven started in the B class race, and had a great
struggle, in which positions changed so often that u
would take a chapter to follow them. Sunbeam
was evidently in a business mood at the beginning
of the race, but seemed unable to keep it up How
ever, she came again, and eventually won an inter"
esting r-'v, with Aoma and Yuelba second and
third. Sunbeam’s margin was 2min. 25sec.
A. O’Hara Wood (Vic.) is nominally the
Ma State’s new singles tennis champion. He might
not have been had A. B. Jones, H. Rice and Co en
tered, but they held off, so Wood becomes It. Jimmy
Anderson, the Schoolboys champion, was runner-up-
Wood beat him in the final 'at Double Bay on Satur-
day by 6-3, 4-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 —not a bad licking
considering Anderson’s infancy. Wright and Alf
Jones retained the doubles title, and Miss D. Gor-
don and Jones, after playing one match and receiving
three forfeits, put the doubles bauble back on their
shelf. In the ladies’ division, Miss Stewart takes
the title to Victoria by virtue of her defeat of Mrs
Ford in two straight sets, and she shares the doubles
with Miss Williams.

There was some interesting minor sport
in Adelaide at Easter. Commercial Travellers,
S.A. v. Vic., got together at cricket on the Oval,
the veteran E. T. Smith presiding at the lunch.
There was the usual small scoring and the usual
interval for visiting Oakbank races. S.A. won
easily. On another ground Stock Exchange clerks
of S.A. took on those of Melbourne —two matches—
and won both. The international Gehrs was out for
13, 4 and 10, but kept wicket finely. A bowls
team from the M.C.C. played various keen games
with sundry clubs. Also, a handball tournament
Eut S.A. ahead of Vic. on balance; but Little (Mel-
ourne) won the championship from Gibbs. This
was a shock, because it used to be supposed that
you can’t play handball unless your name is Hehir
or Breheny, or words to that effect. However, the
Leahy brothers won the Double Champ., and restored
good feeling. Glynn, M.H.R., gave the game a
testimonial as being that on which Ireland’s con-
stabulary is trained.

Sanatogen Brings New
Health and Nerve Force.
“ I have used Sanatogen with extra-
ordinary benefit. It is to my mind a true
food tonic, feeding the nerves, increasing
the energy, and giving fresh vigour to the
overworked body and mind.”
These words by Sir Gilbert Parker, M.P.,
the well-known author, have a helpful
meaning for you —if you need real help in
one of those crises of life when your health
is giving you anxiety.
They echo a sentiment of gratitude which
is expressed in many different ways in
thousands upon thousands of letters from
men and women who owe to Sanatogen new
strength and vitality.
The Rt. Hon. Sir John Gorst, member of His
Majesty’s Privy Council, writes: “ Sir John
Gorst wishes to say he has long been acquainted
with the great merits of Sanatogen—has taken
it with excellent results, and when necessary
will certainly take it again. It was also used
by a daughter of his with great benefit.”
To you who are run down, nervous or
weak —to you who are less than yourself —
Sanatogen will bring new health. To you
whose nerves have gone wrong, and whose
appetite or sleep or capacity for work are
impaired, Sanatogen comes as a rescuing
sustainer, a revitalising force, a feeder of
nerves and tissues.
Write to-day for a Free Booklet, entitled
“ The Art of Living,” to Messrs. A. Wulfing
& Co., 17, Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W.
Kindly mention this paper when writing.

The oldest steamer on the register of N. S. Wales
is the Murray, an ark of 54 summers and about the
same number of winters. One day lately, while
coal was being hurled into the old trollop at the
classic water-front of Balmain, Port Jackson, she
suddenly collapsed and went to the bottom. The
Ancient Mariner and several other authorities have
advanced various theories to account for this way-
wardness, chief amongst them being that the ship’s
cat inadvertently scratched a hole in one of the
plates. But that is merely surmise. All that is
certain is (1) that the Murray filled and sank, (2)
that the cat swam ashore last. It was lucky that it
had a shore so handy.
* * * *
Maoriland is again asking itself why it hasn’t got
the tobacco-growing habit, seeing there is so much
money in it (with a square deal from manufac-
turers) and the local conditions are so favorable.
At odd times experiments have been carried out,
which, although they have not been so complete as
the importance of the business warrants, have yet
satisfied some of the experts that leaf equal to that of
Virginia, Carolina, Greece and Turkey can be grown.
The success of Dutch growers in Sumatra has further
impressed Maoriland. The Deli Co. started there
with a capital of £30,000 in 1869 ; in 1904 its
capital was £400,000. the reserve was £500,000
and the dividend was soaring between 75 p.c. and
100 p.c. During the first 24 years of the co.’s
existence, crops valued at £10,600,000 were shipped
to Holland, and the profit therefrom was roughly
£3,000.000. Which is not so dusty.
“H.J.F..”: Re the Sydney city railway (B.
13/2/’l3), or, rather, proposed railway. This would
have been an accomplished fact long since had it
not been for old ’Enery Parkes’s stubbornness, or
call it what you will. When Commissioner Eddy
came out, almost his first proposal was the dupli-
cation of the western suburban line. Mention may
here he made that this proposal caused the advent of
the brick combine. The proposed duplication, if
carried out, meant the consumption of millions of
bricks in viaducts, subways etc. Eb. Vickery and
others got their legs together under a table, and,
although the price of bricks before was 355. a
thousand, nearlv every brick that went into that job
cost £3 a thousand. Eddv was always hankering
after the extension of the railway into the city, and
all plans, etc., were prenared. This scheme purposed
the building of the central station at Hvde Park.
Old Parkes was in office at the time, and, although
all his Ministers were in favor Of it, he said that
he would agree to a city railway, but would resign
before allowing any of the people’s parks to be
touched. As tubes and underground railways were
not at the time universal. Parkes’s love for open
spaces had the effect of shelving the proposal. Is
it too late now to do away with the camel’s hump
at Redfern and utilise Hyde Park for the central
station? It need not necessarily spoil the park. It
would certainly mean the using of most of it, but
it could still be made beautiful. Look at Belmore
Park now. Although smaller, what a great improve-
ment it is to the old sadeer and its scraggy grass,
etc.! Hyde Park could be made the same with grass
mounds, etc. As suggested in The Bulletin’s
previous article, the camel hump and white elephant
should be removed as soon as possible, ere further
congestion makes it a tenfold more expensive job
to carry out. Even in the early days, when steam
trams were mooted, there were some who could see
a little distance ahead, and would have extended the
railway to the Quay. Even the steam trams met
with great opposition, and the original proposal to
have them running in George-street from the station
to the Quay had to give place, and they were
eventually run down Elizabeth-street; of course,
not as far as the Quay, but only to Bridge-street.
It is on record that the late John See, plain John
Spud in those days, introduced a deputation of
farmers. They wanted horse trams instead of steam,
the reason being that the steam trams did not eat
hay and chaff and horses did. The present
problem certainly calls for having a special Sunday
as a day of prayer in churches and elsewhere to
ask that those in authority so afflicted with impaired
vision will have their optics strengthened sufficiently
to see the barnacles on noses other than their own.
“F.C.”: The average “backbone” is a simple-
minded animal and hungry; but it is his hunger
rather than his simplicity that causes him to fall-in.
Thus, certain down-south farmers are now lament-
ing the disappearance of an alleged firm of wheat-
buyers, who began business recently and offered
such alluring terms that nobody but a fool, whose
greed had blinded his judgment, would have given
them a second thought. Of course, a few cheques
were duly honored ; then more were dishonored;
then an office became filled with vacancy. The pre-
sent system of marketing wheat is little good to the
grower, and co-operation would be a lot of good,
but so long as any number of farmers rush nicely
baited schemes of this sort, co-operation is next door
to impossible. The man who is both selfish and
short-sighted can’t co-operate; it isn’t in jiim.
With a few notable exceptions the N.S.W. Metho-
dist Conference is a solid Anti-Sosh concern ; never-
theless, when it comes to looking after its own
affairs, it thinks so little of Private Enterprise
that it runs its own Fire Insurance Fund. Last
year £209,459 of risks were covered, and only
£24 2s. was paid out ip losses; so there isn’t anv
talk of going back into the arms of beneficent Pri-
vate Enterprise. Like the rest of the Anti-Soshers
they say Anti-Sosh is a fine food —for the other fel-
low.
In Melbourne recently a Chinaman was charged
with attempting to bribe a Customs detective with
a £ 10-note while the officer was raiding his pre-
mises. The Chinaman’s story was charming. He
was horrified at the idea of anyone suspecting him
of offering a bribe. It was all a misunderstanding
owing to the fiery impetuosity of the Caucasian. He
was taking, something out of his safe (he didn’t say
what, probably limejuice), and the note fluttered to
the floor. He picked it up, but the excited officer
immediately seized it and refused to return it. The
jury fell out in a divided state, and the Celestial
was remanded to the next sittings of the court.
Public interest is apathetic as to the fate of the
Chow, but there seems to be a keen interest as to
the ultimate destination of the £lO-note.
Ah Sin still has a few aces up his sleeve. Charged
the other day at Whangarei (M.L.) with employing
two Maori women after hours in his laundry without
a permit, he pleaded that one was his fianefie and
the other her chaperone, and that work was the last
thing thought of when they were on the premises.
The defence didn’t wash either.
Traces of the first woollen factory in Australia,
from the Svdnev Gazette of May 20, 1819: —“S.
Lord bee-s leave to inform his friends and- the
public that he has for sale, at reduced prices, a
quantity of colonial cloth of superior »« n »* actu " t ’
also, ready-made jackets and trousers, blankets hats
•md vain stockings. And for the accommodation of
the settlers °and others he will receive grain and
animal food in payment for any of the above articles
at the market price of the day. S. Lord is willing
to take four or five boys from the age of 11 to 16
years as apprentices.”
“Flam”: “Platman’s” cure for cargo-pilfering (B.
27/2/’l3) is no good. He suggests weighing the
packages on despatch and again on receipt. this
weighing business is attended to now with such goods
as silks, and it makes no difference. I had an ex-
perience with a case of Jap silks a year or so back.
The case weighed to the ounce on arrival in our
store; but on opening up we found two nice smooth
stones, weighing 141 b., in the middle of the ca_e.
We were that amount of silk short. It is doubtful
if the pilfering is done on the steamers at all. We
warehousemen believe it happens between the home
warehouse and the docks; and from the fact that
it’s mostly goods like silk handkerchiefs, gloves and
silks that go, there is a strong suspicion that an
understanding exists between the packers and the
men who next handle the goods.
“Condamine”: Does any expert know if belar is
of any value as mill timber? In Southern Queens-
land immense areas are being ringbarked and burnt
by thousands of new settlers. In its native state the
scrub is magnificent: the trees, their straight trunks
from 6in. to 18in. thick, and with about 40ft. of
useful length, grow so thickly that a horseman has
to pick a way through. The timber is often knotty,
but is very hard and tough, takes a splendid polish
and is surelv good for something besides the firestick.
As belar do’es not sucker, either from the stump or
root, a scrub is done with when once it is destroyed.
That makes it all the more necessary for the right
department to get a move on and investigate, so
that, if the timber is of any value, steps may be
taken to preserve at least some of it.
* * * *
“Tamumu”: The scraping of kauri gum is a mon-
otonous task nowadays. Recently I watched an old
digger at the process. Gum is “up,” and the ‘ gum-
mie” was scraping down the stuff to “nuts” a quar-
ter of an inch square. Gone for ever are the days
when the digger set forth with a spade and a four-
bushel bag, returning in a few hours staggering under
his load ! No scraping for him, his gum being in
big lumps. With a tomahawk he squared the pieces
off, and the remnant went into the dust heap. To-
dav so worked-out are the rich swamns that the lucki-
est digger is the one who can strike the dust-heap
left behind at the camp of some early-day party. It
is the old business of treating the tailings, and of
nosing among the husks for the crumbs that fell from
the rich swine’s table —or something to that effect.
“Tamumu”: Mokai, the Taupo township which
Prime Minister Bill Massey visited the other day,
is said to possess the largest timber mill in Maori-
land. It is connected with the Government line by
a light railway 51 miles long, owned by the mill-
ing co. The co. has no passenger license, and,
therefore, cannot make the traveller pay a fare. It
overcomes this difficulty by making him pay freight
on his baggage. If he has no luggage it charges
him for conveying his pipe or toothpick or any other
old belonging. It is a weird business, and all the
weirder because the engine is—or, anyway, used to
be —fired with totara, of all woods the champion as
a spark-producing fuel; and the guard is kept on
the run if he wants to land his goods and passengers
intact. He doesn’t always succeed. The very day
Massev was in Mokai a spark set fire to one of the
mail bags on the train, and its contents were de-
stroyed. For all that, a trip on this daily rattler
from Putaruru to Mokai is recommended. It lets
vou experience in a mild degree the conditions pre-
vailing in Pig Island when the great volcanoes were
in active business.

“Traffic Branch”: “Montere” (B. 27/2/’l3) sug-
gests a means of overcoming the congestion' of Syd-
ney. “Let the charge for riding over a single
section be made 4d„ that for two sections 3d., for
three sections 2d., and for more than three sections
Id. In this way,” says he, “there would be suffl
cient inducement for men to go far out and live in
good air, amid wholesome surroundings, and s f; li
more inducement for those who continued to c ivi,
to the neighborhood of the city to take a lip]
healthy walking exercise.” Suppose that “MoV
tere’s” system were adopted, and he happened to
live in Redfern, what would he ask the conduc‘or
for on boarding a Dulwich Hill car at Circula-
Quay—a 4d. ticket to Redfern or a Id. ticket"
Dulwich Hill? If the former, then all I’ve cot-to
whisper is “Rats!”
A small council of a Vic. riding received the fol-
lowing tender a few days ago: “Re side tabels and
top draines, i will keep them in good repare to the
satfaction of the clarke of wurks for the some of
£l5 pur amiin the ole of the Riding.” The Presi-
dent critically observed: “’E mighta did the writin’
better, anyhow.”
During the past few months an ingenious Mel
bourne shipping clerk has been having a fine time
at the expense of his boss, a carrying company
The clerk, who was of the “confidential” variety!
was handed fat cheques to pay Customs duty on
imports. When the goods were landed—say, four
cases —he paid duty on three of them, and said the
fourth was for Maoriland. But he had the four re-
moved, emptied one and filled it with rubbish, then
returned it and had it shipped to M.L. Thus,
while the importing co. got all its goods and didn’t
suspect anything, the Customs were taken down
for duty on one case; and they didn’t smell any-
thing until a heap of unclaimed cases of rubbish
was returned from across the Tasman Sea. Then
the very venturesome clerk came to the hurried
conclusion that he and the £2OOO he had made
would be better for a rapid change of air; and at
latest he was still enjoying it.

THE BRIDGE TALKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A project to connect the North Shore and Sydney
with a bridge has at times been tallied of.
—Extract from “Australian Handbook,” 1882.
The Public Works Committee yesterday further
considered the expediency of connecting Sydney and
North Sydney by means of a bridge.
—S. M. Herald, 27/2/’l3.
It always was my great delight to wander down and
see
The drowsy spider ferry-boats come crawling from
the Quay ;
I’d sometimes take a water trip and have a little
blow ;
I knew a joint—
At Milson’s Point —
That’s —let me see ? Why, bless my soul, that’s
thirty years ago!
I recollect the men who talked of great improve-
ment plans,
Of piles and cantilever arch, of girders, bolts and
spans.
Across their bridge of dreams ’twould be a mere five
minutes’ walk,
Their schemes would bu’st
The ferry Trust!
Why, damme, sir! The Trust was safe in trusting
to their talk.
The times may change, but human tongues still
gabble on, my friend,
For then they talked, and now they talk, and there
the thing may end.
And so it is with some delight my solemn way I
wend
Along the Quay
To mark and see
Each drowsy money-spinner help to earn my divi-
dend.

ANT I N EU RASTH I N
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address
in Australia on receipt of 2d. in stamps to cover
postage by the wholesale representative, H. A. God-

H. 1.8.: You miss the point. “H. Horse-
collar” didn't eay Black Brother had no use for
place-names. What he said was that Black Brother
didn’t name a place before if became a place, and
hence the white-man’s struggle to find a Binghi
name for a place that wasn’t a place till day before
yesterday is merely fatuous.... Oftendry: Missed the
’bus; it left several weeks ag0.... Parrakeetyah: Tell
the young man that if he brings that style to the
Inky Way he’ll starve for certain.... P.O.F.': Tough
poultry too old a subject for a prentice hand....
Buckley: You don’t make the question clear; any-
how, your best plan would be to put it to the Agri-
cultural Department... .Yancy: Dan O’Connell ex-
hausted the possibilities of the McSweeney yarn years
ago... .G.M.J.: Little Girl, don’t write any more
silly verses to your stage hero. Ask mother, instead,
whether it isn’t your turn to mind the baby....
Jas. C.: You’d like to hear our opinion of “My
Easter Horse.” So far as the verse is concerned, we
don’t think you would. Drawings are a bit better.
. ...P.J.F.: Looks easy, doesn’t it? But even with
your reconstituted business-men wages boards, sup-
posing one side refuses to abide by a Board’s deci-
sion, what are you going to do about it?....Pen-
dant: Ideas all right, but the verse doesn’t clothe
them to any extent, and naked ideas shock the office
Wowser... .G.W.A.N.: Very young, thin story. It
couldn’t stand the strain of print... .1.L.1.: “An
Idea of Scraggs” isn’t much of an idea as it is
worked 0ut....L.L.: “Squared” has nothing of in-
terest about it except the new word “onslaughter.”
We honestly don’t think you can ever earn money
with your pen. Try a darning-needle or crowbar or
something. .. .A.C.E.: Have read worse yarns than
“The Legacy”; still it doesn’t arrive.... Endabreak:
A poor old yarn which hasn’t improved with age or
the method of telling... .W.T.8.: Your attempt to
pass off other men’s work as your own deserves six
months. ... G.H.: “Drifting” fails, but not by a
mile. ... J.K.0.: “After Sunset” is bright but thin.
... .Z.1.T.: Horrible piece of verse.... The Squaw:
Restrain such longings until you have something to
write about.... Bellerive: “The Shadow of Fate”
makes a strong appeal to us. One section, canto or
spasm:—
A fisherman while out
In a frail open boat,
Was unable to keep
The small craft afloat,
The waters poured in
With a bubbling sounc’,
After a gallant struggle
The fisherman was Drowned,
There was a swirl on the waters
The pathetic scene was ,p’er,
A few miles from his home
On the bleak sea shore.
....Dami: “Australia’s Sorrow” is an awful poem.
Please don’t send us two more verses. Even the
basket would mutiny... .Syd C.: “An Iconoclast” is
not bad verse, but it is not the mad whirling thing
the subject suggests .West Coaster: Theme
worked to death... .M.E.S.: You have some hazy
idea of telling a story, but the story you tell is no
earthly g00d.... Mallee: “The Ancient” is a long,
dreary business with some disgusting spots....
Marcus: The office Wowser is still gloating over
“Desire.” “Confession” has two good lines:—
And I that was a soul have now become
A habit and a hate unto myself.
Polish your verses.... Hannibal: Vile handwriting;
viler verse. .. .Gertrude Forest: No hope... .Jack-
ham: “Bullocky Bill” misses by several miles....
Mac: This paper doesn’t publish yarns of that sort
even if they are good. Yours isn’t g00d....Te Bab:
A reputable chemist endorses the opinion that the
snake-bite “cure” is valuable as a first-aid measure.
All the same, The Bulletin would sooner have its
snake non-venomous if no other remedy was handy.
... .Illinois: Write it again and see if you can’t put
it in one-third the space. .J. G. Crawford: Your
story reads all right; but as the financial results of
that co. have been all wrong, there is something
amiss somewhere... .Masarcus: There’s probably a
grain in it somewhere; but you’ve hidden it in a
ton of words.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.R.J.: Not a trace of varnish left on either. On
one of them we detect a smudge which we think
little Shem made.... Norm W.: The drawing is far
under the mark, and the gag was the first applicant
for the old-age pension.... Mulga C.: You’ve con-
cealed the point very carefully; what’s it all about?
“Korosko” writes: —
One recent day a boy was run over by a tram in
a Sydney street, and it was 20 minutes before the
body could be extricated from under the wheels. It
was in such a position that it was impossible to move
the car either way without mangling the victim more,
so nothing could be done till a screw-jack was ob-
tained and the car lifted bodily. It took 20 minutes
to discover the whereabouts of a screw-jack. In
this particular case the victim had been killed out-
right, but it might have been a case in which prompt
removal and treatment would have meant a life
saved ; 'and the fact that the car carried no lifting
gear with it would have allowed the man to bleed
to death. Screw-jacks are not expensive, nor are
they bulky, and every car should carry one in case
of accidents as long as the vehicles are so con-
structed that it is possible to rup over people.
There is in use in some American cities a net spread
over a frame, which projects in front in such a way
that if it catches a man it is at the ankles. Then
it tips him into the net, where he is safe from
mutilation, but very excited and angry and hot.
Isn’t it time the Sydney tram people experimented
with some such life-saving apoaratus ? The grating
that is supposed to be dropped to sweep the stricken
person along and prevent him getting under the
wheels works very rarely, and When’ it does work
there is little d'fferenee between being run over bv
wheels and pushed a few yards along the rough
street surface.
“Tassy Hoe” : I move for the appointment
of an Inspector of Empty Houses. I have
been unfortunate enough to he more than
once the successor either of tenants whose
exits have been made the back fence
at midnight, and who have, therefore, had no
time to use the family broom, or else of
“respectable” people who are full brothers
to the swine that wallow. In desperation, I
was lately forced to hire a jerry-built “villa”
in a close-by Sydney suburb, and it took two
days and nights and three gallons of disin-
fectant to make the place habitable. There
was enough filth on the premises to dam the
Cotter. After four weeks’ residence, I
learn that the previous tenant was in the
last stages of consumption, and now I am
congratulating myself on the use of those
3gals. of disinfectant. Then there is the case
of the damp house, which breeds all sorts
of trouble. My suggestion is that notifica-
tion of the emptiness of houses should be
compulsory, and that such notification
should be followed by a visit from a health
officer, who would have to certify to the
sewerage, cleanliness, etc., of the house
before another tenant was allowed in. We
have common-sense food inspection, and
it is just ns important to know what kind
of factory is producing our lung food.


Pphat Those Who Know Say of the
« HIGH-GRADE PIANOS.
, f i & maj,( ? rit y oul lanos are sold on the personal recommendation of users, and we are
constantly receiving letters from our customers praising the BEALE High-grade PIANOS Our
instruments are in use in every part of Australia ; in New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, New Caledonia,
Maun ms, oouth Africa, India, and on the continent of Europe ; and everywhere they give the
same unbounded satisfaction.
i B ?l° W 1 WG ew (§ reatl y condensed) extracts from unsolicited testimonials from buyers of
Beale High-grade Pianos.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
Mr. F. OWEN, jun., Hon. Sec. School of Arts,
Tuena: —
“Piano has given every satisfaction. People corn;
petent to judge say It Is the best instrument in the
district.'’’
Mrs. J. A. SWAIN, Kilphysic, Caroll: —
“Has tood the changeable seasons remarkably well.
We are all very pleased with it.”
Mr. Q. JONES, Canterbury:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction. No hesitation
in recommending the Beale to anyone as the finest
piano procurable.”
Mr. E. E. VIDLER, Morisset:—
“Piano is in perfect order, notwithstanding the
fact that it has been in constant use.”
Mrs. ELLEN KILLEEN, Wolfram Street, Broken
Hill:—
“Has given every satisfaction. Tone is rich and
full; instrument has stood the Broken Hill climate
wonderfully; better than any other piano that I know
of. Would recommend the Beale Piano to anyone who
wants a real good piano.”
Mrs. JOAN MASSIE, 44 Hunter Street, Newcastle:—
“The tone exceeds my expectations, being wonder-
fully mellow, while the external finish is very hand-
some. Several professionals have expressed their ad-
miration.”
Mrs. C. JENNINGS, Blende Street, Broken Hill:—
“Better to day than when it was supplied to me
five years ago, and we have had some very severe
weather since then. The tone improves with use.
Can recommend the Beale Piano to anyone requir-
ing a first-class piano for tone, touch and dura-
bility.”
Mrs. F. RUDDOCK, Waimea, Walgett Street, Ka-

came near the Beale for tone.”
Mrs. W. O’HARA, Wyalong:—
“More than pleased with my piano. Everyone who
has heard it admires its beautiful tone.”
Miss A. M. RUDDER, Kempsey:—

in constant use, and tone is as good as when I got
it. Pianists often remark on its great purity of
tone.”
Mrs. H. WALKER, Wandilo, Mount Gambier:—

ful, sweet-toned instrument.”

Mr. T. WARD, Wagin, Western Australia:—
“Greatly satisfied in every respect.”
Mr. W. H. BROWN, Kalgoorlie:—
“Very pleased with the instrument. Much better
than I expected.”
TASMANIA.
Mr. W. K. DRAKE, Westburg:—
“Piano has given entire satisfaction. Have had
it two years, and it has not yet needed tuning.”
Mr. HENRY NEWTON, Launceston:—
“As good as the day I bought it. Can safely re-
commend to anyone. Good pianists have pronounced
it to be a first-class instrument. Touch and tone
are perfect.”
The above are just a few of the many testimonials that we are continually receiving
from users of Beale High-Grade Pianos.
Such success has only been obtained through our unwearying efforts to produce an
instrument of the best quality. That we have succeeded is proved by the opinions of
those who should know best —the users of our pianos.
To obtain this quality we have invented patent methods of construction which render
our pianos more durable, while retaining and enhancing all the musical qualities of the
great makes of the Old World. The use of an iron wrest-plank—which is part of our
patent steel tuning-system—is as great an improvement in the art of piano manufacture
as was the superseding of the old wooden-frame by the iron-frame which is used in all
modern pianos. In addition, we have introduced many other improvements, such as our
method of building up the casework from cross-plies of wood which is all thoroughly
seasoned here, and hencer fit to withstand Australian climatic conditions much better than
timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate of Europe. In order to get the pest of skilled
artisans, we pay higher wages than those awarded by the W ages Boards in the various
trades. We naturally get the best artisans, and thus the best of skill. We use only the
finest of materials.
c realise that an Australian-made piano is subjected to much closer scrutiny in
Australia than any imported piano, and therefore we make—we are compelled to make—
our pianos much letter than those of our competitors. But then, by making pianos in
Australia we are in a position to make them much better suited to Australian conditions.
Any competent cabinet-maker will tell you that timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate
of Europe cannot be expected to withstand Australian conditions of dry heat as well as
timber which is seasoned in this climate. This is a most important point in piano-
making, and is one good reason why so many foreign pianos develop cracked sounding-
boards, split tuning-systems and faulty casework soon after arrival in this country. But
no man can say that he ever saw a Beale piano with a cracked sounding-board. We
absolutely guarantee that the sounding-boards of the Beale Pianos will never crack in any
climate, because our special system of construction renders cracking an impossibility, at
the same time that it greatly enhances the tonal qualities of the instrument. Beale
pianos contain the only practical steel tuning-system in the world—so there can be no
question of splitting of the wrest-plank. And then our patented system of cross-plied
woodwork ensures permanence of the outside case of the pianos.
Be sure of this: the better musician you are, the more you will delight in a Beale High-grade Piano.
We have always on hand a number of good second-hand pianos, taken in part payment of
Beale Pianos.
Call and inspect the Beale Pianos now. Inspection does not put you under any obligation
whatever. You suit yourself entirely as to whether you purchase.
If you cannot call, write for Catalogue, which we will be glad to send post free. We sell for
cash or on easiest terms.

A cool
shave with a
stropped
blade.
You don’t throw Auto Strop
blades away —
you strop them —and they last.
Simpler, too, than changing a blade —takes only
12 seconds to strop ; and the perfectly sharp
stropped blade gives a perfect shave —you can-
not strop it wrongly.
The effect of buying a self-stropping razor is to obtain shaving
satisfaction for a lifetime.
The makers of the Auto Strop rely on your recommendations.
The effect of buying a no-stropping razor is to be kept as a
“ tied house ” for blade renewals.
The makers of such razors rely on the profits of their blade-
renewal business.
The Auto Strop is the only self-stropping razor. Enough said.

| Self - Loading Shotgun
12 GAUGE, MODEL 1911
>
5 The Winchester Self-Loading Shotgun has all the good
l points of other ~ecoil-operated shotguns and also many
l distinctive and exclusive features which sportsmen have
; been quick to appreciate and endorse. Among them are
= Nickel steel construction throughout; a receiver made
; with the Winchester patented “Bump of Strength’’
which gives the gun surpassing strength and safety; di-
-5 vided recoil, which minimizes the “kick” to the last de-
) gree; and a reloading system which requires no read-
) justment for different loads. The Winchester Self-Loader
) will shoot any standard load from a “Blank” to the
) heaviest with certainty and safety, without tinkering the
> action. Also it is a two-part take-down without any
I loose parts. These are only a few of the many good
s points about this gun. To fully appreciate its superiority,
| you should see it. Call at your dealers and look at one.

“Spasmode”: Violet Loraine is like Vincent
Crummies. Turn to “Nicholas Nickleby,” and you
find Crummies saying, “I can’t think how these
things get into the newspapers.” By the way, Cop-
pin was low comedian in the company of Daven-
port, the original of Crummies, and had a dim idea
that he sat for Folair, the comedian in “Nickleby.”
Coppin declared that the Infant Phenomenon, such a
gem in the novel, was grossly caricatured from
Davenport’s clever little daughter, who afterwards
did well in America. Squeers, of course, was Shaw,
a worthy Yorkshire schoolmaster, who is reported
to have died of a broken heart, through the ruin of
his school.
Passed out, George Barnes Bigwood, “grand old
man” of the London stage for more than half a
century. As a boy, 70 years ago, he remembered seeing a
dramatic co. and the whole audience arrested in the
East End for frequenting a “disorderly house.” The
disorder consisted of a performance of “Othello.”
At that time there were only half a dozen theatres
in London legally entitled to produce plays, and as
this wasn’t one of them, it followed that it was a
“disorderly house.”
Lady Constance Stewart-Richardson, who is the
daughter of the Earl of Cromartie and a niece of
the Duke of Sutherland, has made a successful
appearance at the Vienna Opera House in a new
Biblical play called “Judith.” She wanted to do it
in London, but the authorities wouldn’t let her.
There is much Lady Constance in it —especially in
a dance of the sort the patriarchs used to relish
after dining with the boys at Paris House.
From London: The record price for a cino-film
has been reached —£7600. The picture is a colossal
production of “Quo Vadis,” by a company of Italian
players in Rome. So many showmen were after
the English rights that the proprietors decided to
sell them by auction; and the keen competition
took the bids up to the aforesaid astounding figure.
“J.F.H.”: Fred Melville, author and producer of
“The Monk and the Woman,” has been interviewed
in London in reference to Archbishop Kelly’s de-
nunciation of the piece in Sydney. Melville, of
course, was “extremely surprised,” not to say hurt.
“It depicted the triumph of right over wrong.” As
to the marriage of the monk, the Archbish. was pro-
bably not aware that his Riv’rance was a novice
who had not taken any vow of celibacy; and so on
and on. Incidentally- he mentioned that many
Catholic priests and representative laymen had seen
the play, and Rad had their prejudices broken down.
Nobody showed any inclination to give the piece a
further advt. by discdssing that last point with
Melville, who yvas evidently unaware that in Eng-
land priests are barred by canonical legislation from
attending theatres, though, quaintly enough, they
are allowed /to go to minstrel shows and con juring
entertainments^
“J.F.H.”: Ekfcel Irving has scored a success at the
Strand Theatre 4 in a new emotional play by Gladys
Unger entitled “The Son and Heir.” Plot and char-
acters bear a .strange resemblance to those of “The
Eldest Son,” '/by John Galsworthy, though it is
alleged to have been written some time before Gals-
worthy’s little thing was produced. The Chronicle’s
man says that- “Miss, Ethel Irving has a tremendous
opportunity out of which she wrings success with a
lavishtnent of all her sincere and beautiful art. The
Bheer outburst of hysterics was by nn „
greatest part of it, but none the less p f", 8 the
house by storm.” I haven’t seen it myself k J he

From London: For this last vear England has
been in the clutches of American ragtime No
variety bill has been complete without a ragtime
turn of some sort—duo, trio, quartette, real rag
time six, or an American octette. Even performing
seals and elephants have been hammering out svn
copated melody. Signs that it is being overdone
are beginning to make the shoulder-shaking brigade
thoughtful. The last crowd to arrive “The New
York Ginger Boys and Girls,” were given half the
bill at one of the biggest halls for their first week’s
engagement. They were neither better nor worse
than the usual troupe from the States, but the fed-
up public gave them the bird so unmistakably on
their first appearance that they have not tried a
second show. Their motto for the future should be'
“Better never than late.”
From London: The “King George’s Pension Fund”
for actors and actresses is the latest development of
“Royal patronage.” It is the outcome of the last
Coronation gala performance at Beerbohm Tree’s
theatre, which yielded a profit of £4650. This at
Tree’s suggestion' and with the Royal George’s’ap-
proval, has been made “the nucleus of a fund from
which to grant pensions to certain actors and act-
resses whose work, service and needs entitle them to
be nominated.” George V. has now commanded a
special annual performance in aid of this: fund This
year it is to be held at the St. James’s Theatre, and
his Maj. has chosen the play to be presented—“ Lo-
ndon Assurance,” one of Daddy Dion Boucicault’s
earliest and most pronounced successes, but now
rather out of date. I don’t know what her Maj
will say when she knows that the principal character
of George’s chosen piece is Lady Gay Spanker.
“Chasuble”: Though vicar Knight may retire to
a quiet chicken farm, Australia may yet have a
chance to see something like him; for Roy Red-
grave has already a plan for coopering up for
Anderson some such drama as he turned out when
the Crippen case was all the go.
“Billy” Moore, the amiable Melbourne pressman who
introduced himself to London as the fairy godfather
of, literary drama in Australia, has been “walking
on” in Granville Barker’s productions of Shakspeare.
“Billy,” properly trained, might develop into some-
thing of an actor. He has plenty of stuff in his
voice, and a fine, unassuming self-confidence.
CASH FAIRIES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dad sinks and soars on a clanking chain
With barrows of bricks or loads of stone;
He blows his pipes for the rattling crane,
And flies through space on his splendid own ;
While, ev’ry night at the panto gay,
His little girl with the golden head
Flies, like a swallow, on wires away—
They’re fairies both, and they fly for bread.

PUBLIC APOLOGY.
Ilx uie issue or uur paper, me ■‘■"'"vr
Coast Daily News, of February -1
last, a most regrettable mistake was made in
the absence of more responsible parties, in
falsely stating that application had been
made on behalf of the Incorporated haw
Institute for a Rule Nisi calling upon the
City Solicitor, Mr. Percy Dawson, to answer
certain allegations contained in an affidavit
to show cause why his name should not be
struck off the roll of Solicitors, and that the
matter arose out of a Divorce Court Case in
which the Attorney demanded 20 guineas
costs from a husband who was in Auck-
land, as otherwise he would have turn
brought back to Sydney. The Application
referred to will be recognised as one which
was recently before the Court in which an
Attorney was dealt with, but unfortunately
the information sent to our paper referred
only to “City Attorney” and the persons a
the time in charge of the publication of the
paper, knowing that Mr. Dawson is the Lit
Solicitor, most foolishly and improper!

IN BANANA LAND
t : r ? e \ busted Myola” suggestion.
In the Herbert H district, Myola meant a
woman false to her marriage vows, and the
Myola ground” was a patch of land where
the bodies of such women were exposed after
they had been slain. The false crowd that
imposed the Canberra site on the Common-
wealth are not politically dead yet; other-
wise I think Myola would have done nicely;
The Law still has quaint notions about the
dipsomaniac. Thus the Rockhampton P.M.,
addressing an habitual against whom there
stood “60 convictions, remarked the other
day: “The only thing to save you is to send
you to gaol”—the very method of salvation,
in short, that had been already tried some
scores of times, with obviously barren re-
sults.
Brisbane Courier', which barks under
Fat’s whip with the Argus for a team-mate,
is indignant that the people of Australia
should be “pestered” with the Referenda
again, after having once said “No.” The
Tory sheet puts it this way:—
The proposals embodied in the six Referenda ques-
tions to be answered on May 31 are substantially the
same as those which the electors negatived with
splendid decision on April 13, 1911. Apart from
party reasons, there is absolutely no justification for
again involving the Commonwealth in the turmoil
and expense of a Referenda campaign.
Well, if that is good argument it must also
be apparent that nothing has happened to
suggest that the electors have changed their
political minds since they negatived, “with
splendid decision,” on April 13, 1911, the
appeal of the Fat party to be returned to
the Treasury benches in the House of Reps.
Presumably, therefore, the Courier agrees
that there is no justification to waste money
in turning the same party down again.
“Dano’s" wail of the Northern pioneer:—
hen the mendicant Queensland Government is
cutting up the proceeds of the next lOU it might
do worse than redeem its promise to extend the
Cairns railway from its present scrub terminus. The
timber industry, the mainstay of the new settlers
further on, is practically hung up, there being no
possible tracks to Jumoulin, the terminus. The train
to that place, though it runs only three times a
week, is a ghastly financial failure, and every trip
merely increases the burden of debt. The selectors
have taken up scrub land farther on at the exor-
bitant price of from £3 to £6 per acre. They
were lured by the Government’s promise to build
the line, the bait being held out to them that bv the
sale bf timber they could partly recoup themselves
their original excessive outlay. And even when a
settler can get a load of timber in, note how the
business is handled. Sawn timber consigned to
Cairns is machine-weighed; carriage, 14s.- 2d. per
ton. Log timber is charged for ;by. measurement
weight, also at 14s. 2d. But a truck of sawn timber
by machine weight, containing 4800 super, feet, is
charged as 12 tons 16cwt. ; while a log, also con-
taining 4800 super feet, is charged as eight tons—
a clear gain of £3 6s. Bd. for the log-roller in the
city mills.
NO DOG FANCIER.
BRPWN: “ Call oft your infernal dog, Smith—he might bite me!"
SMITH: "H's all right. He cant bite; he's got no teeth."
BROWN: "No teeth! Never mind — he’d give a fellow a nasty suck."
That eminent patriot and colleague of Den-
ham’s, A. H. Barlow, on returning to Queens-
land, greeted his country thus :
It was a mighty relief to getAaway to Maoriland
and to be away from the baleful shade of the Com-
monwealth—to think that you had put four days*
sail between yourself and Mr. JusticF Riggins.
Dear, dear! And wouldn’t they let' the dod-
dering old man stay in Maoriland?
The palm for originality in suicide goes this
month to Charley Sherwin, of Winton, who
stuffed 2ft. of towelling down his throat Jnd
then wrapped his head in a blanket. But
perhaps it was a hotel towel, and the poor
chap, after inspection, took it for a gigantic
jim-jam.
Dr. Richards, of Mt. Morgan, is conduct-
ing a highly commendable crusade against
that abomination, the common school panni-
kin. Says Richards: “Parents think nothing
of their children using the same pannikin as
scores of others, while they would be highly
indignant if their darling Ethel ever dared to
put Mary Jones’s hat on.”
The Courier of 50 years ago told of
attacks on stations at Peak Downs and
Albinia Down by aboriginals.- ‘‘So disgusted,”
says the old paper, “has Mr. Chambers be-
come at the deprivation of the slightest police
protection that he has sold out, and purposes
leaving the colony.” Wonderful the way we
have got on considering how consistently
capital has been flying from the country ever
since it was a country!
This thing is demanding very serious atten-
tion. Not only are Bananaland’s immigrants
nearly all landed in the South, but many of
the paltry 5 or 6 p.c. who are dropped in the
North drift towards Brisbane as soon as pos-
sible. A recent press item thus tells how “12
immigrants who had previously been landed
in Townsville waited for the next boat, and
took passage by her to the Queensland capi-
tal.” Not Queensland alone, but the whole
Commonwealth is vitally interested in find-
ing out why.
Society in Bandicoot.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s gaddin’ and there’s gossipin’ in droughty
Bandicoot,
And women gassin’ over every fence. . . .
They say the Melbourne office ’as give Woollyboy
the boot,
’E alius showed an awful want o’ sense;
’Twas boozin’ up at Morris’s or talcin’ out the gal—-
I seen it with my eyes and couldn’t doubt it,
And ev’ry swaggie’s tellin’ of the story to ’is pal;
But as ter me, I seldom talk about it.
And Smith, the newchum banker, ’e ’as taken to the
dice,
I don’t the dickens ’e can do it,
For Jones, as Ajag' 1 . before him, was a gambler, and
the price '
’E’s payin’ at the present—-don’t ’e rue it?
They say the English parson ’e was summoned once
for breach—
Why will the spiteful beggars go and shout it ?
We want to keep a parson as knows ’ow to pray and
preach,
And that is why I never talk about it.
The Boss’s wife at Binnie Downs, as drives a pair
o’ greys,
She’s alius in the township, so I ’ear;
And if she shocks the people by ’er free and easy
ways,
She’ll find ’er name is frequent where there’s Beer ;
That strappin’ young O’Sullivan, ’e seems to catch
’er eye,
But, as to any scandal, I would' scout it;
Although I seen ’em yesterday colloguin’, and—Oh,
My 1
I ain’t the one to say a word about it.
Old Maclcaboy, of Brigalow, is mortgaged to the ’ilt,
And every week is landin’ of ’im deeper ;
’ls son went to the devil, and it took a lot o’ gilt
To save ’im from the sack —and somethin’ steeper.
I ’ear there is a rumor that ’is daughter in Moree
Was just a trifle giddy, hut I flout it;
My motter is: Believe hut just the ’arf of what you
see;
And what you ’ear, he slow to talk about it.
\nd Joskins (’e’s a justice), ’e was tight upon the
bench,
I ’eard he give a drunken bushie “life.”
And Whittington ’as got into a mess about a wench,
And ’ad a bitter quarrel with ’is wife.
They say as old O’Hara is so frequent with the
glass,
’E never seems to go an hour without it.
But then I never could believe he’d be that kind of
ass,
And so I’m rather slow to talk about it.
The people ’ere in Bandicoot is rather prone to talk,
And anything will serve ’em for a ’andle;
You come ’ere with a character as clean and white*
as chalk
And find yerself a target for their scandal ;"
They ’aven’t got a notion of the sl-'ghtest charity,
And everybody’s weakness they must spout it; *
But speak of humans kindly is the maxim Dleases
me — .
And if they're crook, be slow to talk about it.
QUEENSLAND.
P. FLAM.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, March 29, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The Oriental ball on Thursday was a
benefaction in more than one way. It pro-
vided (1) funds for a deserving institution,
(2) work for hundreds of dressmakers who
had never seen a Turkish lady’s garments in
their untravelled lives, and (3) unlimited
laughter to the poor galleryite, who isn’t
often considered. Weird garments, which
were reasonably suspected of having been
cut from a pattern of pa’s pyjamas, were eked
out with Swiss milkmaids’ bodices, and hats
no nation on earth would acknowledge. There
were, of course, dozens of pretty dresses, but
the great majority were frantic. It says
much for the politeness of the Asches that
they didn’t wear even the suspicion of a
smile when the niob paraded for the “best cos-
tume/’ prize.
Miss Love, who caught the judges’ eye,
was in a Chinese woman’s dress. Her sister
looked remarkably well as a Nautch girl, and
others appreciatively noticed were Mollie
Ferrier (a recent debutante)., Milo Bracker,
Isabel Macdonald, Lottie Bond, Dorothy
Ryder and the tall Jamieson girl.
One youth, who danced steadily all even-
ing in an overcoat, caused a lot of
brain fag. No one could guess what he re-
presented, although the explanation was
quite simple. There was a nail in one of
the chairs.
Decrees nisi may' come and separation
orders may accumulate, but marriage goes
on for ever. On Wednesday Miss Nora
Curtis was bound in gold to an Englishman
named Ernest Trafford. She committed
herself in a white satin gown with the added
attraction of a priceless Limerick veil
alleged to be some hundreds of years older
than the oldest inhabitant, which carries it
into a'vague and unreliable past. First aid
was afforded the bride by sister Eileen,
whoee dark hair was tucked up for the
first time. The preliminary celebration took
place on Tuesday, when Mr. and Mrs. Tem-
ple Cur-ti« fed some hundreds of friends at
the Cafe Eschenhagen.
The other bride was Marion Darvall, who
promised to do the fair thing by Matthew
Halfe Wilkinson (another Englishman). The
proceedings took place on Wednesday at St.
John’s Cathedral. Gladys Pollard and
Mabelle Nicholson, in cream cloth dresses
and pretty purple hats, were the bride’s
right-hand girls, and when it came to carv-
ing the roast cake, Mrs. David Hamilton
provided the necessary accommodation at
her home. The moon is glittering at Red-
land Bay.
The Eisteddfod ended its existence on
Easter Monday in a burst of Hallelujah
Chorus, by the united and discordant choirs.
Talking about choirs, the one from Lismore
(N.S.W.) scooped two prizes, but the prin-
cipal trophy was knocked down to the tune-
ful howls of the Cambrian choir under
Leonard Francis. of the more bear-
able of the soloists, and those to whom sad-
dened adjudicators handed the blue ribbon,
hailed from Maryborough, and were pupils
of the veteran operatic mummer, Charles
Kenningham, who has set up his tent in
that town.
. Y’he races on Saturday were uninterest-
ing and dull. Not a frock worth gossip
floated above the squelchy wet lawn. It
was a (lay of mere gamp and macintosh.
But on Monday our Very Best emerged in
Garments. Mrs. Cecil Palmer wore some-
thing special (imported), and Mrs. Stan-
ley Chapman, Mrs. Leishman and Mrs. Ted
Cullen stirred the green snalm
natural dwelling-pllce &ke of env y in i tg
Mrs. Peter Murphy fed all cromiet ni„

Breathless wire from the North:—
Apropos Wienholt’s electioneering cam™,-™ ,
Wide Bay with the boxing gloves p r £f ffn for
battle is to be fought right through' in this wav ‘u
so, what’s Jokook’s weight? I want to know-badl
From Alfred Deakin’s address on the Ref'
erenda last week :
It was not only unfair, but deliberated j
ing, that, in the handbook about to be issued
every elector, no reference was made in thJ ” t 0
for the Government side to the fact that the i -u C<ue ,
party had moved amendments To the Labor n ?'
posals, and had offered to undertake and JL pro l
certain of those proposals. support
It is an interesting case of the politician in
search of a grievance—any old grievance
however thin. If the Opposition thinks the
point is going to do Liberalism any good t
will, presumably, in its section of the pair,
phlet, mention the fact that the Deakin crowd
is in favor of several of the Labor proposal*
Why the Laborites should do this servfce foi
Liberalism is no more apparent than whv
Bulgaria should supply Turkey with car
tridges.

STOCK SADDLE
£6 6s-
This Stock Saddle is by far the most;'
“Popular” throughout the Commonwealth,'
because our Customers say so, and the Man
who has ridden hundreds of miles in one of
these saddles knows what he is talking about
when he says “That Uhl’s Stock Saddles
Can’t be Beaten for service and comfort.”
Built for real hard wear —hand sewn
throughout, sin. kneepad, on substantial tree,
extended facings and solid point to panel,
brass mountings (nickel if required), fitted
with girth, crupper, surcingle, 4-bar irons
and stirrup leathers.

For the Country Horseman
The saddle here illustrated is expressly designed
for country use, for stock riding, etc., and is built
of the best materials throughout. If any of our
friends are requiring such a saddle they will find
this a genuine bargain.
It has a hog-skin seat, a plated bar-tree, extra
long flaps, with points to buckle below. An economi-
cal feature is the skirt, which extends all round
and thus adds years of wear to the saddle by pro-
tecting its interior from the weather. It has a
deep, “sweepy” seat, 4in. kneepads, nickel-plated
iron stirrups, and double buckle leather girth. The
price complete is £3/ 15 / - Mention of The
Bulletin when ordering will ensure your having a
leather surcingle given in free, and the saddle. will

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf; you will be glad to
hear of a simple ahd scientific device whifch restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the WilsOri
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests oh a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, We give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest Sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, arid
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the hea r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend _ „
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You 'niay wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a Single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent’ you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

the size of a threepenny bit,
which was very inflamed.
It gradually spread all un-

over her face; the only place
not affected was her nose.
Whenever she was washed
her face got quite raw look-

burning her, other times it
was quite scaly just like a
lot of dandruff and under-
neath quite raw and fed,
“I bought a cake of Cuticura Soap and
washed my little girl in warm Water and
Cuticura Soap and then applied the Cuti-

only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (tJ.S.A.) Mexican Walnut

10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
1 reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
ff<st. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
aga'in. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. [
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing coni
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

i :■ James Middleton,,recently. retired on,,a
pension from Melbourne Herat, 1> after 40 years’
grand work, was two years old when his parents |
brought him to Tasmania from the Cold Country. |
He started his press career in the island, continued
it on a Geelong (Vic.) daily and on the Ovens and i
Murray Gazette, and when I joined Melbourne j
Herald staff in 1887 he had already been some j
years sub-editor there. James Halfey and S. V.

“Oboe”: “Ross Crae’s” par., lauding Nettlefold,
founder of Hobart Daily Post (B. 13/2/’l3), is
hereby endorsed as to those parts which are reason-
ably truthful or fairly probable. But there are
limits. Bor instance, it is necessary to mention
that N ettlefold displayed such poor judgment when
he started the Post as to imagine that a strong
third party could then (1908) be manufactured in
lasmaman politics. In April, 1909, several candi-
dates were endorsed by the Post, which whooped
for Deakimsm. Not one was successful. But the Labor
party, whose candidates the Post party opposed,
doubled its representation, though its only, journal-
istic champion was the Clipper, a small weekly
The Post, which had started with £600 , 0 capital,
when at least £ 20,000 was needed, had to get money
and a political following somewhere, or disappear.
Nettlefold saved the pieces by * swallowing the
Labor platform whole. Labor acquiring one-third of
the shares in a 4112,000 co., and electing one of the
three directors. This scheme involved the absorp-
tion of the old Clipper and the signing by Nettle-
fold of an agreement that he would use his voting
strength (some 2500 shares) to keep the Post
advocating the yndiluted Labor platform, no matter
what non-Labor shareholders did. The arrangement
lasted until a few months ago, when Nettlefold
and other large shareholders accepted a Labor offer
of par (£1) for their shares, and got out. This deal
cost the Tas. Laborites nearly £6OOO of their hard-
earned savings, and left them With an empty
money-box to fight the recent unexpected elections.
But the Laborites now enjoy complete control of
their own paper, instead of being in it on sufferance,
so to speak. Considering the blunders Nettlefold
made (mostly blunders of inexperience, of course),
he must be regarded as an exceptionally fortunate
person to have escaped from his exciting job with
his capital intact and his health good enough to
permit him to start other businesses, including a
printery.
* * * *
E. Dwyer Gray, who takes on the management of
Hobart Daily Post in place of A. J. Nettlefold,
bought out by the Labor organisations, was for a
year or two on the managerial staff of Dublin
Freeman, which has been practically owned by his
family for generations. He left there some 17 years
ago, and for a good while past has been sub-editing
his apple orchard in the Derwent Valley (Tas.).
But he avers that he has never been able to get the
whir of the printing machines out of his memory
in a decade and a half, and every time he sprayed
his apple trees he could smell printers’* ink a-calling.
Despite bickering's in the camp, the Maoriland
journalists are moving on to better things. About
nine months ago an association was formed much on
the same lines as the Australian Journalists’ Associa-
tion (practically a trades union) by a considerable
number of pressmen who had grown tired of the
mere superiority of the Journalists’ Institute. The
first proposal of the new body was to seek a Dominion
award, either by concession on the part of the em-
ployers or by the say-so of the Arbitration Court;
hut a break-away at Wellington upset the plan. It
was then decided to go for local awards, and these
seem in a fair way to come into general operation.
At Auckland an agreement was recently fixed which
seems likely to be the standard for the other main
centres; anyway, the Conciliation Council at Christ-
church, a few days ago, practically adopted it with-
in its jurisdiction. The scale is: Senior reporters,
£5 10s. a week; generals, £4 155.; juniors, from
£3 to £3 10s. The hours are not to exceed 96 in
a fortnight. The pay is not much to whoop about,
considering recent leaps in the expense of keeping
the family pot boiling; but it is a start. And no-
body ever got anywhere without a start.
From London: The Speaker of the British Parlia-
ment announces a concession to the “overseas” press.
There is no room for more reporters in the already over-
crowded Press Gallery ; but by giving five days’ notice
the rep. of an Australian or Maoriland newspaper
will be supplied with a ticket admitting him to one
of the Strangers’ Galleries, where he can take notes.
But the five days’ notice is absurd. The common-
sense plan would he to give to overseas men passes
like those issued to the London Gallery men, admit-
ting them to the Strangers’ Gallery whenever a sub-
ject of interest to their papers was on the carpet.

Dizziness, Retching, Shooting Pains and Shortness of Breath.
Many Treatments Useless. A Splendid Cure by BILE BEANS.
u DILE BEANS are a grand medicine for
— } liver trouble/' says Mrs. E. Moore,
of 76 Hindmarsh Square, Adelaide.
“ My liver was a source of great worry
to me for a long time. I suffered
frightfully from biliousness and sick
headaches. Indigestion also tortured
me cruelly. I was awfully dizzy, and
the bilious headaches used to make me
sick with the constant throbbing.
“ I was so stricken with the indiges-
tion that household duties were an
impossibility. The pains in the chest
were terrible, and rendered breathing a
great difficulty. The bilious attacks were
also very trying. I used to be simply fit for
nothing, and attacks of dry-retching would
strain me internally very severely. The head-
aches that would result from this state of things
were almost unbearable.
“All the remedies I tried failed to give me
relief. I could derive no benefit from any of
them. At last I decided to give Bile Beans a
trial, and the very first dose worked such

wonders in me that I determined to continue with this splendid medicine. The
result exceeded my most sanguine expectations, for all the terrible 4 sick liver '
symptoms left me completely. Now my liver does not trouble me at all, and I
enjoy good health. I eat and sleep well, and in many ways have derived great
benefit from Bile Beans. I strongly recommend this grand family medicine to all
suffering from liver trouble, indigestion or biliousness/'

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H \ / HAT time the merry thunders play,
\\ And fire-balls leap from out the
1 " sky,
And waters in a world of grey
Have left no spot of Mabel dry,
In happy dreams above the mud
I like to think of Noah's flood.
1 want to see the waters rise,
And Heaven’s high windows opened wide,
The while with triumph in my eyes
I watch my ark upon the tide/
And two and two the freight it bears
Beneath the hatches say their prayers.
My up-to-date menagerie
I should select with special care ;
It would not greatly trouble me
To miss the lion and the bear ;
The adder and the tiger-snake
As passengers I would not take.
But that the world might still survive
With all the joys that once it knew,
I should select to save alive
Two dimpled girls with eyes of blue,
And two whose hair was black as jet
I should collect from out the wet.
Two Wowser parsons long and lean
To mourn o’er follies past repair ;
Two poets with their laurels green
And any quantity of hair;
Two Dago waiters skilled to slay
The wilding oyster and the cray.
Two Tory statesmen out of place,
Two _ persons of exceeding fat,
Two wine-bound wights in evil case,
The Dry Dog and the Souter cat —-
These with some pleasant beer to breed
Might make a world to match my need.
Beneath a large umbrella curled.
Upon the ark’s roof I should lie,
And see the bath-tub of the world
Cleansed with the rain-spouts of the sky ;
But dry upon that raging sea
Should float my own menagerie.
And when the dove came back again
Bearing a gum-leaf in its bill.
And all the wet had time to drain
From off some pleasant woodland hill,
Our A ready would be re-born
With all that did its prime adorn.
The maids whose hair was black as jet,
The dimpled girls with eyes of blue
A nleasant picnic feast should set
In that old world “that seemed so new,
And Wowser whiskers might begin
To wag again at mortal sin.
But laughter bright would wing the day,
While both my poets broke in song,
And heavy Fat in dances gay
Would speed the hapny hours along,
And we should see a rainbow furled,
As Noah did, across the world.
And no one would have any cash.
And no lorn wight should lack for cheer.
Because the world had gone to smash
To bring again the golden year ;
But joy should break in bloom and bud
When coin and capital were mud !
What time the merry thunders play,
And lightnings leap along the sky,
I dream of all things washed away,
Except a few that I kept dry;
T want to see the waters rise,
And view the world with Noah’s eyes!

CURSE O' MOSES.
The Kit.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
171 OR eighteen months Charles Augustus
t Miller, better known as Dusty, had
been borrowing clothes. If lie wanted
to go ashore he borrowed a suit; when he
had to muster his kit he did it with other
people’s clothes; and now, when there was
a buzz that the crushers were going to make
a raid on those who were dodging Divisions,
nobody would lend him a suit. This was
Dusty’s grievance.
“Why don’t you buy less beer and more
clothes?” said Jimmy Green, his chum.
“That’s all right for you, Jimmy, but you
never worked in a pub before you joined.
What about a rub of that old suit of
yours?”
“Can’t be done, Dusty, old mate. I used
it for coaling in, and now it’s torn up for
cleaning-rags up at the gun.”
“ fine chum you are!” said Dusty,
trying to work on the memories of past
runs. “Here we’ve been boozing-chums all
the commission, and now you won’t help a
mate out of a hole. Snivelling to the cap-
tain of your gun—that’s all it is, taking a
real good suit like that for cleaning-rags !”
Jim wasn’t to be tempted from the good
cause of trying to make him buy a new
suit.
Dusty walked away thinking of revenge,
and more painfully of how to get out of the
difficulty. He had his revenge first, by eat-
ing his own breakfast and Jim’s as well.
Then he went down to the bag-flat to con-
sider matters. He pulled out his bag to see
that no one had put a new suit in it for a
joke, but his kit —a pair of sea-boots and a
painting rig—hadn’t been added to. The
case seemed hopeless.
As he was standing there thinking the
Navy wasn’t much of a job, the flat-sweeper
came along.
“Hullo, Dusty. Going to Divisions this
morning?”
Hope came to Dusty again. He went over
and whispered the same old words to the
sweeper.
“No chance,” said the sweeper. “I’ve
got to go myself to-day. But I always
thought you had a good kit.” He walked
over and gave the bag a shove with his
broom. “Why, there’s room for you in
there as well as your kit!”
Dusty didn’t wait to argue or think about
it. He just rushed up on deck looking for
Jimmy Green.
“I’ve got it, Jimmy! I’ve got it!” he
said excitedly. “Come here, quick.”
Jimmy, thinking Dusty had pinched a
suit, and wanted protecting while he put it
on—in case the owner appeared—followed
him.
When they got down to the bag-flat again,
Dusty pulled the sea-boots out of his bag,
shoved them in the rack, and then stood in
the bag and pulled it up round his shoul-
ders.
“Just tie this round my neck, Jimmy,
and stow me in the rack, and if you’ll come
down and pull me out after Divisions we’ll
go ashore together to-morrow night.”
“Not unless you’ll promise to get a new
suit next week,” said Jimmy.
“I will, as sure as my name’s Dusty
Miller.”
“All right. In you go.”
Then Divisions sounded. Dusty wriggled
the boots into a good position for a pillow,
and was pretty soon asleep.
The skipper’s liver must have been out of
order. lie was taking twice as long as
usual to go round, and was finding faults
everywhere. Just as lie got to where
Dusty’s bag was stowed, there came a snore.
He stopped, and pricked up his ears. “Mas-
ter-at-Arms !” he said.
The jaunty jumped forward.
“Sir!”
“Did you hear a snore?”
“No, sir,” said the jaunty, surprised.
“Well I did, and I want you to find out
who it was, and bring him here at once.”
The jaunty looked round in all the likely
places.
“Can’t see anyone here, sir,” he reported.
The skipper, who had been following him,
thought he must have mistaken, and was
just moving away when there came another
snore, louder and longer than the first.
“Did you hear that?” he roared.
“Yes, sir,” said the jaunty.
“Send for all the ship’s corporals, and
make a thorough search and find out who
it is.”
“Very good, sir.”
“It isn’t very good,” fumed the skipper.
“Ay ay, sir,” said the jaunty.
The skipper marched up and down to the
tune of Dusty’s snores, while the jaunty
sent a messenger for the crushers, who soon
arrived at the double. Then, with the
jaunty as their leader they started to
search. They crawled all around the bag-
rack, under it and over it; they pulled up
deck-cloths, and looked behind chests.
Dusty still snored on.
The skipper was just going to leave them
to it when he caught sight of a couple of
bags whose numbers were turned upside
down.
“Find out the owners of those bags, and
put them in the report,” lie said.
“Ay ay, sir,” said the jaunty, and lie
caught hold of one and straightened it. As
he tried to turn the other, he got hold of
Dusty’s feet, and nearly twisted them oil’.
One wild yell came from the bag. A smile
came slowly over the skipper’s face.
“Pull that bag out,” he said.
A crusher pulled it out and dropped it on
the deck, and there was Dusty, one side of
his face covered with grease off the boots,
and the other very pale.
“Ah, it’s you, Miller,” said the skipper.
“What have you got to say?”
Dusty said nothing.
“Master-at-Arms, I will see him directly
after Divisions.”
“Ay ay, sir,” said the jaunty, as he un-
tied the bag.
The skipper got quite happy. Not another
fault did he find.
He was always pleasant when he was
going to serve out a few days’ cells.
When Dusty was brought up the skipper
was smiling and humming a tune.
Dusty’s heart fell. Dong experience had
taught him the skipper’s moods. If he was
solemn and roared about what you deserved
and what he thought about giving you, it
was a sure acquittal. If he smiled and was
very gracious, it was about thirty days’
leave stopped. A chuckle meant about seven
days’ cells, and a laugh was the sign for
fourteen. When he began to get hysterical
a court-martial was in sight.
“Miller,” lie chirruped, “what have you
got to say?”
“Well, sir,” said Dusty, “as I was going
along the bag-flat this morning I thought I
smelt the insulation of the electric light cir-
cuit burning, and as the wires ran along the
back of the rack I crawled in to see if I
could find what was wrong. Then the heat
must have made me faint, because the next
thing I knew was being pulled out by the
ship’s corporal.”
“Very thoughtful of you, Miller —very,”
said the skipper: “but how do you account
for being in the bag?”
“Only thing I can think of, sir, is that
someone came along and saw me, and
slipped the bag over me for a joke.”
The skipper started to laugh. “A very
good joke too, don’t you think, Master-at-
Arms?” The jaunty laughed —according
to regulations.
“Well, Miller,” said the skipper, “if I
thought you were skulking from Divisions
I would punish you severely.”
“Thank you, sir,” said Dusty.
“I think, as it is, you had better have
fourteen days’ cells, the first and last three
on low diet.” Then he considered awhile.
As it seemed to be expected of him, Dusty
said, “Thank you, sir,” again.
“And you will muster your kit when you
have done that,” went on the skipper, “and
for every day it isn’t complete you will have
thirty days’ leave stopped; and on every
Sunday for the rest of the commission you
will report yourself to the Officer of the
Watch immediately after Divisions.”
“Thank you, sir,” said Dusty.
“It’s a pleasure, Miller —a pleasure,”
said the skipper. “And. Master-at-Arms,
when Miller has finished his cells, report
to me when you have mustered his kit, and
I will inspect it myself. I am sure it will
be a model of neatness and good clothes.”
It was. Everything from oilskin to tooth-
brush was straight from the slop-room.
Dusty wasn’t beaten, though.
After he had done his cells and mustered
his kit, he came into the mess with his bag
and held an auction, and sold everything
under cost.
“I’ll get me own back on the cow!” he
said.
The next Sunday he was rushing round
to borrow a suit to report himself in.
B. M. LEVER.


“WHY AM I ALWAYS ILL?”
There are many people who seem to be always taking medicine
and yet are always ailing.
The reason is this: They do not take the right kind of
medicine.
There is no medicine that cures all diseases. It is no use taking
a kidney and bladder remedy for constipation, liver complaint or lung
troubles, neither is it any good taking ordinary medicine for kidney
and bladder troubles.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are solely for the kidneys and bladder. They do not
interfere with the liver, stomach or bowels; all their healing properties go to the kidneys and
urinary system. They are therefore the best medicine known for uric acid troubles, dropsy,
urinary disorders, over-activity of the bladder, pain in seeking relief, gravel and stone, pains
in the back and loins, rheumatism, lumbago and sciatica, for these ailments arise from
urinary poisons left in the blood by weak kidneys. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cleanse
and regulate the kidneys and bladder like ordinary medicines regulate the bowels.

11 YEARS CURED.
Mrs. Chris. Kerrigan, 5 Gould Street, Sydney, says: “My husband has been
simply plagued with rheumatism for the past 10 years. This malady attacked
him in the joints, and it was almost impossible for him to work. -On one occa-
sion he was laid up for 12 weeks. He tried a number of liniments, but they
afforded him no relief. Then he used blood remedies, but the result was no
better. I got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and after taking less than half a
bottle of this remedy, he said he felt better than he had felt for 10 years. Grad-
ually the pains lessened until he was quite cured. He attributes his cure solely
to the use of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and he swears by them.”
Eleven years later, Mrs. Kerrigan confirms the above. “We were living in
Maitland when I made the above statement 11 years ago, and I am pleased to
be able to say now that my husband has been quite free of rheumatism ever
since. His lasting cure is proof positive that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
thoroughly genuine.”
ONE YEAR CURED.
Mrs. E. Wilkinson. 29 Campbell Street, St. Peters, Sydney, says : “For some
time I suffered agony from Lumbago-like pains across the small of my back.
These pains prevented me from bending or getting proper rest at night, and seri-
ously hampered me when attending to my household duties. Sometimes I was so
bad I could hardly move, and if I tried to get about the house, the pain was
almost unbearable. My kidneys, I know, were very much out of order, and were
really the cause of my constant suffering. I tried all sorts of medicines in the
hope of getting well again, but was not successful in finding a remedy that suited
me. At last a friend recommended Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and they did
me good almost at once. After taking two bottles of these pills, I was ever
so much better, and eight bottles completely cured me. That was 12 months ago,
and I have been well ever since. I always keep a bottle of Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills in the house, and take a dose occasionally, and they keep me in splen-
did health.”

A Gladness of Uncertain
Figures.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f|A|HE brightest beer that ever grew
Its rose of tufted froth,
When nights were soft and days were
blue
And Alabel’s eyes were both,
Was nothing to the thing I knew
That night, I take my oath.
The crescent of the hornfed moon
Was like a little boat,
Or like the section of a spoon
Upon the skies afloat,
The languid breezes seemed to crooii
Around my overcoat.
They seemed to croon a simple lay
Replete with sob and sigh,
As if all little cats at play
With curving whiskers dry
Scratched at the skirts of yesterday
With an unmeaning eye.
I know that Mabel’s hand was soft,
And that her dress was brown,
The while her clear brow held aloft
Some feathers like a crown,
And that whene’er the engine coughed
Some of her hair came down.
She did not know, she did not care,
Which means that mine was such
A sweet companionship to share,
And I so nice to touch,
That the condition of her hair
Could never matter much.
It came upon the midnight deep
That glorious thing I saw;
I could not smile, I could not weep,
But all my placid jaw
Was shaken as the pinks of sleep
AVhen dreams are curried raw.
My Alabel did not see the thing,
Though both her eyes were wide,
The faint white lustre of its wing
Was over all the tide,
And life and joy and hope and Spring
Had veiled it as a bride.
My wild heart hammered like a sledge
Against my startled breast;
I seemed to lie upon the edge
Of Wonder silver-drest,
And the thin point of some large wedge
Divided peace from rest.
All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
All hopes of joy to be.
Like angels dressed in golden tights,
Crept softly over me ; «
A sense as of a thousand nights
Of wine and revelry.
Like small wartn snails sweet kisses burned
Around my lips and chin ;
The ashes of dull Care were urned.
And with a golden pin
My fancy pricked the bubbles spurned
By waves of elder sin.
I held it gently in my hand,
The lamplight o’er it streamed,
A thing to conquer and command
A young, glad world redeemed
From AVowser wastes of weary sdnd
To all my hot soul dreamed.
The evening paper that I held
Was like a summer dawn,
For forthright from its page it yelled
That the BIG SWEEP was drawn ;
And there, in printer's figures spelled,
Aly shilling number shone !
t knew those figures Well by heart,
For I had conned them o’er,
Or thought I had, with careful art
Behind my bedroom door,
On darkened eves when hopes would start
And chase me round the floor.
And now the hopes that ran like mice,
To lion’s stature grown,
Had caught my joy as in a vice
And pinched me to the bone
Of gladness, and their teeth were nice
While biting me alone.
Alas ! The schemes of mice and men
Of which they squeak or shout
Are ruined with a crooked pen ;
Aly soul went free from doubt
Till on mil ticket one cold ten
From Heaven chucked me out.

GEORGE STREET.
His Mistake.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ % OUR name is James Emerson, I be-
lieve, and you are a woolbuyer by
profession, residing in Terralong-
road, Stratlifield. Now, I want you to tell
the Court, in your own words, what you saw
on the night of the lGtli .Tune last.”
The Crown Prosecutor bent forward
slightly, and the stout man in the witness-
box spoke nervously.
“I had been away on a fortnight’s trip to
the West —it was the morning of the 17th,
you mean, I suppose? Well, I came home
by the mail train —it gets to Stratlifield
about half-past five —and took a cab, and
when we turned into Terralong-road I saw
Mr. Hewlett—the prisoner, I mean —coming
down the steps of one of the houses some dis-
tance up the street. It was old Air. Martin’s
house, I believe.”
“How could vou see or recognise him at
that hour? It must have been quite dark
at that season of the year.”
“The street is well lighted. I could see a
man coming down the steps, but I cannot say
that I recognised him until I passed him,
when he happened to be under one of the
lamp standards. I knew him well by sight;
I had seen him go to Air. Alartin’s house be-
fore —the old gentleman was his uncle, of
course. But I may have been mistaken.”
“You are sure of the house?”
“Well, it was dark, you know. Still, I
know the exact position of the house. It is
next door to mine. I did not pay much at-
tention. There seemed to be nothing unusual
about it, except”
G° on tt
“I was about to say that Mr. Hewlett
seemed anxious to avoid attracting atten-
tion. It occurred to me that his demeanor
was somewhat—er—furtive, as it were.”
“Do you know anything about .the prison-
ers relations with his uncle?”
TT- \ have heard
I object, yr Honor,’ said counsel for the
accused, briskly. “The witness canftot say
what he heard. ’
You must confine yourself to facts within
your personal observation, witness,” said the
Ju of e - . . . tt ~ , T
I was about to say, your Honor, that I
have frequently heard sounds of quarrelling
proceeding from the house. I—er—assumed
the voices to be those of the prisoner and his
ur Vk'h ' , . „„
But you cannot say for certain?”
Well, no. I know the prisoner very
slightly. I would not like to swear to his
VO mf' e ~, . , , , . ... A
The foreman of the jury looked intelligent.
The witness obviously disliked his position,
and was probably trying to shield the pris-
on f<fni as ar as p °i j’kp' .
I lie jury would like to know, he said,
“whether the witness has any reason to be-
lieve that it was the prisoner he heard
quarrelling with his uncle. Perhaps lie had
seen him enter the, house before these alter-
ca tJons took place. ’ .
‘That is so, said the witness. The fore-
man nodded solemnly.
* * *■ , . * .
I hai e put the whole of the facts before
you, gentlemen of the jury, but I shall now
briefly recapitulate the principal features of
i r tt • ,
Ihe deceased. Mr. Martin, was a gentle-
man ot advanced age _ and considerable
wealth, residing alone in Terralong-road,
Strathfield. lhe prisoner was his nenhew,
and is known to have frequently visited him,
and to have been well acquainted with his
domestic arrangements.
On the morning ®f the 1 1 th .Tune last Mr.
Martin was found dead in his bedroom
which was in a different wing of the house
from that in which the servants rooms were
situated, and from which no sound could be
heaid by any of the other inmates of the
n °“i e * ~ , ,
ie medical evidence showed that the
eause of death .was a wound in the back of
the head obviously not self-inflicted—and
a heavy stick, which has been indentified as
one belonging to the deceased, and usually-
in his room, has been produced. The stick
is deeply stained with blood, and according
to the medical evidence, is such a weapon
as might have produced the wound which
caused, the death of the deceased.
Evidence has been called to show that
the deceased was about to contract a mar-
riage with a young lady very much bis
junior. It has been said—and not contra-
dieted that the prisoner, .who was liis
uncles only surviving relative, was, per-
licips naturally, much chagrined when he
heard of his uncle’s intention; and it lias
also been shown that the prisoner’s finan-
cial affairs were seriously involved. The
Crown Prosecutor suggests these facts as
supplying a possible motive for the assumed
crime -
“You then heard the evidence of Mr.
Emerson, to the effect that he saw the nri«
oner leaving his uncle’s residence at a verv
early hour on the morning of the 17th. This
is the only evidence definitely connecting
the prisoner with the crime. 8
“However, the defence has offered nn
evidence to rebut any of these statements
It has been urged that a crime of such an
apparently brutal nature was utterly alien
to the nature of a man of refinement and
education, such as the prisoner appears to
be. This is for your consideration, gentle-
men. It has also been suggested that Mr
Emerson may have been mistaken in his
identification of the prisoner as the man
whom he saw leaving the deceased’s hous»
on the morning in question. That is quite
possible, considering the darkness, and the
fact that the witness did not see the man
very clearly—you will remember that he
was driving past in a cab. But at the
same time, gentlemen, it is my duty to
point out to you that no alibi has been set
up—that is to say, there has been no evi-
dence called to show that the prisoner was
elsewhere at the time in question. Gentle-
men, consider ”our verdict.”
* * * *
Mrs. Emerson sat in the half-light, curled
up among the cushions on the big divan
under the window. She was a pretty, com-
fort-loving little person, though for the
moment she was looking miserable enough.
Her husband was smoking lazily in a chair
on the other side of the room.
“Why this fancy for sitting in the dark.
Kitty?” he said. “It isn’t like you.”
“I have a headache to-night, .Jim,” said
the girl nervously.
“You are probably upset about that
wretched case,” said the man. “It has been
a great strain on us both, of course, owing
to my close connection with it. I believe
you knew young Hewlett pretty well—the
late Hewlett, I should say. You know he
was —er hanged this morning.” He
giggled nervously as he spoke, and his wife
gripped the cushion beside her. “I don’t
know many of your friends, my dear, but I
have heard quite a great deal lately of your
friendship with Hewlett.” His wife stared
across at him. but it was too dark to see
his face. “Well, murderer though he was,
it is a ghastly responsibility to have been
instrumental in the death of a fellow crea-
ture.” He spoke ponderously, but his eyes
were alert enough, and he was watching his
wife intently.
“For God’s sake. stop. .Tim. I must tell
you. I was responsible. I could have saved
him.” , ,]
Emerson laughed again softly.
“You -were mistaken in your evidence.
.Tim. It was this house lie came out of.
not Martin’s. He was —I was —he was
more than my friend. There. I have told
you ! I am his murderess. And he never
spoke. He never told.” She had stood no
while she was speaking and faced him with
the desperate courage of a woman who is
past caring.
Her husband came across the room to
her.
“You need not have told me, Kitty. I
knew which house he came from.” He shook
with his ugly laughter. “I Very seldom
make mistakes, you know.”
