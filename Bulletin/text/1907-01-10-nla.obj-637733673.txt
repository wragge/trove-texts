SUNLIGHT AND FOG
“ %r ES,” mused Arthur Streeton, ab-
\ sently groping for the tobacco-jar,
‘ * it’s fine to be back again in the
sunlight, the grey-greens and
bronzes .and golds, after the vivid, staring
greens of England. They are beautiful, too,
but they tire an Australian’s eye. The best
color in England is the grey—the lovely
greys of the mist.”
Then Streeton drifted into casual talk of
London, the exacting centre of the art-
world, the mother greedily feeding upon
the genius of her in-gathered sons. Into
that remorseless vortex of London is being
irresistibly, indiscriminately sucked all the
artistic talent of the Empire ; and in its
confused and swirling depths the artists of
the world are indistinguishable as English-
men, Americans, Australians —they are but
painters painting for the greater glory of
London. Australians ? Yes perhaps
twenty of them, all doing good work, recog-
nised by critics from St. Petersburg to New
York, their pictures year after year accepted
by the Academy and the Salon—and
yet, lost in the crowd, recognised and
classified and claimed as Englishmen.
A little colony of Australians holds
precariously together at the Chelsea Art
Club, yet not as Australians but as members
or friends of a group of young, strenuous
workers that may produce some of the great
names of the future. The Australian artist
in London is merely an artist —not an
Australian.
“There is Lambert,” Streeton suddenly
enthused. (At the dinner given by the
Sydney artists to Streeton, after he had
restlessly listened to all the enthusiastic
things said of himself and his art, he got up
and launched out into a paean of belief
in the future of George W. Lambert,
whose black-and-white work in the English
magazines invariably bears the signature
“G.W.L. of N.S.W.”) And Streeton has
much to say of Lambert, who regrets his
“Across the Black Soil Plains,” in the
Sydney gallery, as sincerely as Australia
reveres it. “He is the coming man. He
has helped himself, of course, by watching
the pictures of the masters ; he has studied
and worked, and has found himself. And
now his style is his own. He paints with
lots of color—splashes it on almost extrava-
gantly ; but it is his style—his splendid
and fearless attack—that has brought
him so irresistibly to the front. Decora-
tive ? Yes ; but every picture is a decoration
if it is any good. Every picture is a space
that must be decorated with line gmd color—
so that if it were turned upside down it
would be good Lambert has just done a
nice commission' given by C. Thomson, the
senior partner in Agnew’s, the great picture
dealer in Bond-street—a group of all Thom-
son’s children, with a little donkey, painted
on Hampstead Heath. Another is a curious
group of Miss Thea Proctor, a model and
myself—strong work, and for that reason not
likely to get into the R.A. If it did, it
should be the picture of the year. But it
will be shown elsewhere. Lambert is the
legitimate successor to Furse, who died just
as he achieved complete recognition.”
As Streeton paused to relight his pipe, he
was gently led away from the subject of
Lambert. “There’s Conder, almost for-
gotten by Australia.” (He is represented in
Sydney Gallery by a little picture—all light
and color—of Circular Quay.) “ Conder is
already recognised in the greater art world as
a master. His fans—paintings on silk with
a most delightful Watteauesque touch—are
exquisite things, and his decorations on great
spaces of silk for private houses’ are worth
what he likes to ask for them. His position
is absolutely fixed. His artistic worth is
recognised in Berlin, Paris, St. Petersburg,
America.
/ “ Yes, he's made more money —and earned
it—thananyotherAustralianartist.” Streeton
smiled. “A strange man for an artist.
He’s got the best business head of any
painter I’ve ever met. His natural wisdom
is wonderful, and his personality—ah, his
charm of personality !. ..” Streeton groped
for the matches. ‘‘ He would talk any buyer
round .. . but he’s got the work to sell. He
has just as grand gifts for making himself
known as Whistler. And the others 1 Ah,
there’s Longstaff, Roberts, Fox, all doing good
portrait-work. That’s the stuff that pays in
England—better than landscape ; the return,
you see, is more immediate. Fullwood, too,
doing charming monotypes—paintings in oil
on a china tile from which one impression is
taken on paper. I’ve told him to send some
out here. Norman Hardy, Mahoney —
never saw anything of Mahoney—London is
a big cemetery where one can so easily bury
oneself. .. . Twenty of them, Australian
artists, buried somewhere in England ! If
they all came back—ah ! They couldn’t all
come back—couldn’t live out here. Not
a big enough leisured class in Australia.
Yet the State has done very much here ; it
has brought swarms of Australian paintings.
Why, the N.S.W. gallery has seven of
Roberts’s and five of mine! Melbourne, too,
has done much ; but the initiative came from
New South Wales.”
And so, by this roundabout route, big,
dreaming Arthur Streeton is led to himself.
‘ ‘ I’ve done a lot of work about the Thames
—Kew Gardens and down the River. That
picture of mine of Trafalgar Square ? Ah,
that’s in Melbourne now —bought by Pro-
fessor Baldwin Spencer. Now ” (obviously
relieved) —“ Now I must go. Got a lot of
fellows to see yet, and every hour is filled in.
But I’ll be back in Sydney soon. Yes, a
match please. Right, I’ll take the box.
Good-bye.”
CHESTERTON ON CHESTERTON
When G. K. Chesterton writes a book it
is really a book upon G. K. Chesterton.
He may pretend to take for his subject an
artist or a poet or a novelist, The Napoleon
of Notting Hill, or the members of 'his Chib
of Queer Trades; but these are merely the
strings of the instrument upon which eter-
nally he plays the diverting little melody of
G. K. Chesterton. He has none of the equip-
ment *of a critic ; therefore he exuberantly
criticises Watts and Browning and Dickens
—and would probably convince the reader
that a lack of critical attributes is the first
necessity of a critic. So is his Browning or
his Dickens the reader will find a good deal
about Browning and Dickens, and much
more about G. K. Chesterton. He depicts a
Browning that would have probably given that
gentleman a pain, and he draws a Dickens
that would have made that novelist write
an indignant letter of protest to the press.
And yet, by insisting upon the gentility of
Browning and the democracy of Dickens,
Chesterton pictures a plausible Brown-
ing, aud quite \ a possible Dickens.
Both his subjects live but in a
Chestertonian atmosphere. Both bio-
graphies are so intensely interesting that it
were supererogatory to inquire if they are
true. The reader must, for his enjoyment,
accept the Chesterton view-point, and look
out through his temperament upon a Ches-
terton universe. And if Chesterton considers
that it will contribute any freshness to his
views to look at Watts or the universe
upside down, he promptly stands on his
head and gives you his delighted comments
upon an inverted landscape. His subject is,
in effect, nothing to him except a peg upon
which to drape the rich garment of his robust
humorand gracefully to hang a string of spark-
ling paradoxes. Chesterton could as easily
write a volume upon a cab-horse, or the
sidereal system, or ferro-concrete as upon
Browning. It would be just as brilliant,
just as richly spattered with paradox, just as
verbally laboured—and yet just as genuinely
stimulating, and just as illuminated with
philosophy as his Napoleon of Notting Hill.
Set him off upon any subject and he becomes
the subject, and is apt to ride it to death.
It was in The Napoleon of Notting Hill
that Chesterton really achieved an effect,
though even here his fantasy lacks the unity
that art demands. Into that novel Chesterton
crowded a fine satire, a great moral, and a
gorgeous description of a mediaeval battle in
a modern London, yet by the glamor of his
poetry lie made even his grotesques possible.
No reader can easily forget the meaning of
that little preposterous empire of Notting
Hill. This was Chesterton’s one effort at
novel-writing, and from that effort he has re-
lapsed into literary criticism and riotous
articles in the daily press upon everything
else on earth.
There is'only one thing that Chesterton
reverences in this “ best of all impossible
worlds,” and that is humor. Hence, in his
latest book he approaches Charles Dickens
(Methuen, Loud.) almost on bended knees.
He grovels at the feet of Mr. Pickwick,
reverently declaring him “equal unto the
angels.” Chesterton finds that stout gentle-
man also “a fairy,” and “J/he abstract
wanderer and wonderer, the UlySses of
comedy ”... and many other weird and
reckless things. And it must be said for
Chesterton that, to one reader of this newer
generation, at least, he has made faintly
comprehensible the rough-and-tumble humor
of Mr. Pickwick ; he has succeeded in giving
a plausible explanation why the English
roared with laughter—and, it is credibly
stated, still chuckle—over The Pickwick
Papers. And 'that is an achievement that
almost makes us acclaim Chesterton as
a critic. And the one humorist does
give a convincing /picture of the ’other.
The reader may protest that it is too con-
vincing to be true ; but once enveloped in
the Chesterton atmosphere Dickens becomes
alive—a man who might actually have lived
and lectured and posed and wrote gigantic
and tumultuous novels. And of these novels
Chesterton has many an illuminating criti-
cism. Thus, he points out that it is not
Dickens’s exaggerations that explain our
more recent neglect of him, but ‘‘that for
our time and taste he exaggerates the wrong
thing.”
Dickens’s work is not to be reckoned in novels
at ali. Dickens’s work is to be reckoned always
by characters, sometimes by groups, oftener by
episodes, but never by novels. .. . Strictly there
is no such novel as “Nicholas Nickleby.”, ’1 here
is no such novel as “ Our Mutual Friend.” ’they
are simply lengths cut from the flowing and
mixed substance called Dickens —a substance of
which any given length will be certain to contain
a given proportion of brilliant and of bad stuff. . . •
The units of Dickens, the primary elements, are
not the stories, but the characters who affect the
stories —or, more often still, the characters who do
not affect the stories. . . It is also true that all the
moving machinery exists only to display entirely
static character. Things in the Dickens story
shift and change only in order to give us glimpses
of great characters that do not change at all.
Dickens did not write what the people wanted.
Dickens wanted what the people wanted. . . .
The belief that the rabble will only read rubbish
can be read between the lines of all our contem-
porary writers, even of those writers whose rub-
bish the rabble reads. Mr. Fergus Hume has no
more respect for the populace than Mr. George
Moore. . . . But Dickens never talked down to
the people. He talked up to the people.
When those who starve and suffer speak for a
moment, they do not profess merely an optimism,
they profess a cheap optimism ; they are too
poor to afford a dear one. . . These higher optim-
ists, of whom Dickens was one, do not approve
the universe; tljey do not even admire the uni-
verse; they fall in love with it. They embrace
life too close to criticise or even to see it. Exist-
ence to such men has the wild beauty of a woman,
and those love her with most intensity who love
her with least cause.
J*
But interesting as Dickens may be, it is
when Chesterton deliberately drops his
subject to tutn literary somersaults and
splutter paradoxes that the reader must
needs smile and acquiesce. For Chesterton,
despite his exuberance and delight in tilting
at windmills, has things to say that need
saying, and are delightfully said. When he
goes a-tilting he uses no spear; but the
breath of ridicule overturns many a creaking
old windmill that has been too long left
cumbering the landscape.
The thing which is foolishly called the Anglo-
Saxon civilisation isat present soaked through with
a weak pride. It uses great masses of men, nob
to procure discussion, but to procure the pleasure
of unanimity ; it uses masses like bolsters. It
uses its organs of public opinion, not to warn the
public, bat to soothe it. It really succeeds, not
only in ignoring trie rest of the world, but actually
in forgetting it. And when a civilisation really
forgets the rest of the world—lets it fall as some-
thing obviously dim and barbaric—then there is
only one adjective for the ultimate fate of that
civilisation, and that adjective is “Chinese.”
In England has arisen a parvenu patriotism
which represents the English as everything but
English ; as a blend of Chinese stoicism, Latin
militarism, Prussian rigidity, and American bad
taste. And so England, whose fault is'gentility
and whose virtue is gentility, England with her
tradition of the great gay gentleman on Elizabeth,
is represented to the four quarters of the world
(as in Mr. Kipling’s religions poems) in the enor-
mous image of a solemn cad.
If barricades went up in our streets, and the
poor became masters, I think the priests would
escape, I fear the gentlemen would’; but I believe
the gutters would be simply running with the
blood of philanthropists.
When you break the great laws, you ao not get
liberty; you do not even get anarchy. You get
the small laws.
The freshness of Chesterton’s outlook,
even though it be due to his incurable habit
of standing on his head and looking at the
universe through the inverted opera-glasses
of an epigram, after all reconciles the reader
to his extravagant style. Chesterton is
original always, and originality is a wayward
plant that must not be pruned. We must
take him with his extravagances thick upon
him, and pluck, here and there, these
blossoms of beauty and truth ;
This life of grey studies and half-tones, the
absence of which you regret in Dickens, is only
life as it is looked at. The life of heroes and
villains is life as it is lived. The life a man
knows best is exactly the life he finds most full of
fierce uncertainties and battles between good arid
ill—his own Other people’s lives may easily
be human documents. But a man’s own life is
always a melodrama. ■
Youth is almost everything else, but it is
hardly ever original. We read of young men
bursting on the old world with a new message.
But youth in actual experience is the period of
imitation and even of obedience. Subjectively
its emotions may be furious and headlong ; but
its only external outcome is a furious iunitatjon
and a headlong obedience. As we grow older we
learn the special thing we have to do. As a man
goes on towards the grave he gradually d covers
a philosophy he can really call fresh, a style he
can really call his own, and as he becomes an
older man he becomes a newer writer. Ibsen, in
his youth, wrote almost classic plays about Vi-
kings ; it was in his old ago that he began to break
windows and throw fireworks.
The public does notlikebad literature. The pub-
lic likes a certain kind of literature, and likes that
kind of literatue even when it is bad better than
another kind of literature even when it is g00d,..
Ordinary people dislike the delicate modern
work, not because it is good or because it is bad,
but because it is not the thing that they asked
for... They will be indifferent to “Les Aveugles,”
not because it is good drama, but because it
is bad mdodrama... When they walk behind the
brass of the Salvation Army band, instead of lis-
tening to harmonies in Queen’s Hall, it is always
assumed that they prefer bad music. But it may
be merely that they prefer military music—music
marching down the open street, and if Dap. God-
frey’s band could be smitten with salvation and
lead them, they would like that even better.
The only element of lowness that there really is
in our populace is exactly that they are full of
superiorities and very conscious of cUss. Shades,
imperceptible to the eyes of others, but as hard
and haughty as a Brahmin caste, separate one
kind of charwoman from another* kind of char-
woman. . . . The democracy has only one out-
standing sin—it is not democratic.
When Diogenes went about with a lantern
looking for an honest man, I am afraid he. had
very little time to be honest himself. And when
anybody goes about on his hands and knees, look-
ing for a great man to worship, he is making sure
that one man, at any rate, shall not be great. The
error of Diogenes lay in the fact that he omitted
to notice that every man is both an honest and a
dishonest man. Diogenes looked for his honest
man inside every crypt and cavern ; but he never
thought of looking inside the thief. And that is
where the Founder of Christianity found the
honest man. He found him on a gibbet and pro-
mised him Paradise. Just as Christianity looked
for the honest man inside the thief, democracy
looked for the wise man inside the fool. It en-
couraged the fool to be wise. ',.

gift for graceful rhyme—and nothing more. A

Far from the stern land of his love and pride,
Moulded his golden sonnets ere he died.

Bequeathing the gifts of gracious rhyme
His Land shall glory in, in future time.

All serious lung troubles
begin with a common
cold. A cold in the
throat easily passes to
the bronchial tubes,
and you have bron-
chitis, leading pos-
sibly to pneu-
imonia or con-
sumption. Stop
your cold before it goes down into
the chest. When you bring a bottle
of Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral into the
house you bring with it relief, good
cheer, hope, and sunshine. It is a
standard and unrivaled remedy for
colds and coughs. I
There are many substitutes and imi-
tations. Beware of them and of so-
called “Genuine Cherry Pectoral.”

TO BE REGISTERED IN QUEENSLAND UNDBR “ THE COMPANIES ACTS 1863 to 1896.”
CAPITAL: £75,000 in 150,000 Shares of 10/- each
60,000 Shares to be issued to the Vendor Syndicate rs part payment for the mines and ore at grass and for
the benefits derived under an agreement made with Messrs. J. S. Mae Arthur and Co., of London and Glasgow.
50,000 Shares to be issued as fully-paid-up on payment of ss. per share on application and ss. per share on
allotment.
As a large portion of this issue has been placed in London, it has been agreed to open an office with a Branch
Share Register there.
Of the £25,000, the proceeds of the sale of 50,000 shares, £5OOO is to be paid to the Vendors, who undertake to
pay brokerage andjxll organising expenses of the Company, leaving a net working capital of £20,000.
40,000 Shares to be held in reserve for future issue if found desirable.
Provisional Directors :
JOHN MUNRO, (Kuranda), W. J. MUNRO (Cairns),
E. B. TORPY (Chillagoe), JOHN S. MacARTHUR
(London).
Secretary (pro. teiji.) and Broker:
A. J. DRAPER (Cairns).
Bankers :
QUEENSLAND NATIONAL BANK, Limitbd.
OBJECTS:
This Company is to be formed for the purpose of acquiring from the Vendors, the Mitchell River Gold and
Antimony Syndicate, Mineral Leases Nos. and 2145, and Mineral Homestead Leases Nos. 1044 and 1045,
situated on the Mitchell River, in the District; and all the rights and benefits conferred by an
agreement made with Messrs. J. S. MacArthur and Co., of London and Glasgow, by virtue of which the Syndicate is
authorised to use free of charge in perpetuity all the processes presently controlled by Messrs. J. S. MacArthur and
Co., as-well as any process or processes acquired by them during the next seven years.
From a report submitted by Mr. P. Brander, General Mining Manager of the Chillagoe Co., Ltd., it will be
seen that there are 12,851 tons of njaterial already available, of an average value, of 25'93 per cent. Antimony and
loz. 3dwt. Gold. Taking the value of 50 per cent. Antimony ore at the mine, after allowing for transport and
realisation charges to be £45 per ton, the value of 25‘93 per cent, ore will be £ll 145., and with Gold at £4 per ounce
and containing loz. 3dwt. valuqjor £4 125., we have a total valqe of £l6 6s. per ton of ore.
From this there falls to be dedqpted mining and development costs and administrative charges which we
estimate should not exceed £1 per showing a profit of £l5 6s. x 12,861, say £196,620.
Appended is the certificate of Messrs. J. S. MacArthur and Co. as to the treatment of the ore.

CERTIFICATE by MESSRS. J. S. MacARTHUR & CO.
74 York-street, Glasgow, 25th October, 1006.
We have pleasure In certifying that average samples of ore submitted to us from the Mitchell River
Antimony Mine have been treated by us with the most satisfactory results.
The ore by our new process readily yielded from 93 to over 95 per cent, of its Antimony contents,
leaving the gold contents practically intact and capable of being as fully recovered by the ordinary
methods of cyanidation or chlorination as if dealing with virgin ore.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A "Winter Night.
’Tis good to sit beside a log
Of blazing forest tree,
And listen to iEolus roar
Outside the barricaded door
His thund’rous melody.
They laugh and pass the love-warm wine
The while the children list
Unto the thrush’s song divine
Embalm’d and buried in the pine
As far as they have wist.
Burst by a flame, the pine breaks wide—
The song escapes its heart
(Like to the blood of some sweet bride
Trickling in tears a-down her side
Thick from the feathered dart. . . .)
The children in the chimney nook
Scarce speak each other’s name. . . .
Their shadows like a reaping-hook
Curve round the hearth as if to stook
The shaking yellow flame.
And grim with a stave,
His cloak flung back and torn,
His inky stallions back hath drave
Into their spidered stable cave,
There to await the dawn.
N.S.W.

Nocturne.
White sea-guard patrols.
Beat the tide ;
O’er the dappled shoals
Sea-mews glide,
Nought distressing nigh,
Only hush and sigh
Of sea-lullaby,
Near and wide.
Chrome and fluorspar
Dye the deep.
Saffron, cinnabar,
Sky-ward creep,
Star-swarms prick with light
Heaven’s velvet height,
And sea-scented night
Bringeth sleep.
Sleep, that should be life,
May be death;
Sleep, that chideth strife
With a breath ;
Sleep, that dulls the eyes
Of tired sacrifice,
And, when passion dies,
Chasteneth.
Softly bruise the sands,
She is dead ;
Fold her sad, white hands,
Raise her head—
Such soft, tawny hair !
Better, better ’twere
Someone scarce so fair
Slept instead.
Trusting wanton waves’
Wooing touch,
Scarce a minute raves :
Death is such,
It must ever reap,
We must ever weep,
Weep and fall asleep,
Grieving much.
Lift the dainty shell.
E’en the shoal
Knows her dead ! ’Tis well,
Bowed in dole,
We should pray awhile,
•Lest coarse flesh defile
Such fair clay, and guile
Taint her soul.
As she loved the sea,
Let her grave
By the margin be :
When the wave
Lusts for swimmers lorn
She will cry them warn,
Guide them to the bourn —
Guide and save.

In Exile.
I oan hear the muffled roar
Of the breakers, on the shore,
In the tree-tops far above me,
As I watch the blinking stars;
And the rustling foliage seems
Like wave-ripples in my dreams,
While the crooning of the deep sea
Calls me from the dark belars.
And a whiff of salty foam,
Tossed from crested roller’s comb,
Comes to me in mem’ry only
As I wake at breaking day,
And the cattle come to drink
To the river’s muddy brink ;
Oh, the Bush is strange and lonely,
And the sea is far away.
I am exiled far from home,
Westward ever must I roam,
For the soft nor’-easter’s deadly
And the sea-breeze whispers “ doom.”
So the tree-tops’ muffled roar
Sounds like breakers on the shore,
And in dreams I hear the medley
Of the surge’s distant boom.

THE 11 BRUNSWICK” ICE MACHINE
dsds
COLD STORAGE ON A
SMALL SCALE.
(XF course it can be done on any scale, no matter how
v large, but the “ Brunswick ”is the first successful
6mall capacity machine, i.e. it will give you a cooling
capacity equal to the melting of 200 lbs. of ioe, and only
takes a £ h.p. to drive it.
This means that it is admirably adapted indeed in the
smallest size. It is intended for the large Boardinghouse
or Mansion, the Hotel, Butcher’s Shop, and anywhere
where it is desirable to preserve perishable articles of
food. In the hot regions of the country, where ice is,
if obtainable at all, very costly, it may be installed, and
will be a great boon. Very easily worked, with
practically no attention, and always effective.

How to Address Betters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the paper
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ ropy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
ahvays is.

“RACE SUICIDE.”
The vital statistics of Australia for 1906, so far
as they have been collected, contradict some of
the conclusions of the pessimists on the birth-rate
subject. The year has been an extraordinarily
prosperous one for Australia, and should, there-
fore, according to the views of some, have shown
a further dwindling in the birth-rate, “since the
poorest are the most prolific, and with prosperity
comes a falling-off in fertility.” But the contrary
was the case. An improvement in the population
figures was shown throughout the year in all
Australia; the little Australian arrived with a
good deal more frequency than during the pre-
vious lustrum. It is also argued that as the
civilisation of a country improves, the birth-
rate must decline. This also though the
basis of one year’s figures is rather narrow
to found an argument on such a wide
generalisation—has been contradicted; for Aus-
tralia, with its bettering birth record, has shown
no lapse into savagery, has kept indeed well
within the current of progress. In addition to
these negative indications on the subject, there is
an even more re-assuring positive one. It seems
to have been shown that an appeal to reason, good
morals, and patriotism can have an effect upon
people in this regard, for the betterment of the
Australian birth-rate followed closely on a public
agitation against the tendency to unduly limit the
size of families. Ihis helps, with some previous
experience, to the conclusion that, when urged
thereto by appeals to patriotism, a civilised people
can be induced to sacrifice, pretty generally, indi-
vidual ideas of convenience to the common good.
(As in France, when at one period of its history
it was clearly in want of men, maternity became
the fashion ” among women, and those who could
not, by their appearance, indicate patriotism
padded to give a false oomplexion of approaching
motherhood to their figures.) If that conclusion
is correct; if it can be shown that when the call is
for population a nation’s citizens will provide the
babies, whatever their individual notions as to
the discomfort of having families, the reason for
pessimism as to “race suicide” will vanish.
There will ultimately come a natural settlement,
in which emigrant countries will show a poor,
immigrant ones a high birth-rate; and the
Australian wife and husband will have resigned
themselves to maintaining the highest effective
birth-rate possible, since Australia is, of all
civilised countries, the most poorly stocked with
people.
* * * *
The highest effective birth-rate, it must always
be insisted, is a different matter to the
‘highest birth-rate.” Theoretically the people
with the largest number of births adds most
quickly to its population. Practically—in cities
especially—the waste of life in very large families
is enormous. The children are born only to die
in infancy—either because the mother has not had
sufficient time to recoup her vitality since the last
birth ; or because, when there is a large number of
almost contemporaneous infants, sufficient care
cannot be given to each in the average household ;
or from both causes combined. From a civic
standpoint, there is no good in bringing children
into the world simply that they may die. The
best family to the State is that of which
every member has a reasonable chance of reach-
ing adultage. The family in which there are
10 births and but three survivors is a common
enough circumstance. A family showing four or
five births and no deaths is of far more national
use. Of course, much yet remains to be done to
raise the limit of the “effective birth-rate” by
civic organisation. As, with the spread of muni-
cipal Socialism, drainage, milk and food supply,
hospital accommodation, ventilation, street cleanli-
ness and park accommodation improve, the possi-
bilities of population-increase will grow enor-
mously. The dangers which now beset infant life
and take a toll of more than 10 per cent, of the
lives under one year are practically all preventible,
and are now rapidly vanishing in those countries
where sound municipal government is the rule.
The “ effective birth-rate ” is thus helped in two
ways. Not only is the danger to the infant
lessened, but the wife is encouraged to maternity
by the knowledge that much of the trouble and
inconvenience of adding to the population has
been removed. In the ideal city of the future,
every mother will know that she is a welcomed
guest at a perfect maternity home, where science
has exorcised all the demons that wait on the
parturient woman. She will know that her babe,
guarded at every turn against food or air infec-
tion, can only by the rarest accidents be fretful or
ill; she will no longer see in motherhood the
beginning- of a long series of pains and vexations
and worries. Under such conditions the “effective
birth-rate ” would very quickly advance ; and
such conditions are being now ushered in by
municipal Socialism. That is the optimistic
(and, seemingly, the reasonable) view to take
of the “ race suicide ” fear—that, under
the influence of patriotism, the people of a
poorly-populated country can be induced to take
up the task of quickly populating it ; and that,
with wise government, the cares and risks of
maternity can be so much lessened as to
enormously increase the effective birth-rate.
re * * *
Another view is that by Mr. J. W. Barclay,
writingin the Nineteenth Century, on the “Race
Suicide Scare.” It is true, he maintains, that
births are dwindling ; but it is the result not so
much of any conscious attempt to limit the size of
families as of a natural tendency to dwindling
fertility in the highest types ; and deaths dwindle
too, so that the net result in high types is an
increased ratio of population growth. The
“natural increase” in England and Wales for six
decades from 1841 to 1900, he gives at 10’2, 11‘9,
12 7, 14, 13'3 and 11*7, whilst for the five years
1901-1905 it was 12T, thus showing that there has
been no marked decrease lately. Comparing Eng-
land with countries of high birth rates he adduces
these figures :
Average per 1000 Population.
This is, in a way, counsel of comfort, but to some
degree fallacious. In spite of all that statistics
say or do not say, there is not the least doubt that
the dwindling of the birth-rate in civilised coun-
tries is a matter of deliberate choice and effort,
not a natural, inevitable result of higher civilisa-
tion. And it is a misuse of words to assert that
the higher the type the less the natural fertility.
So soon as there is a marked decrease of the power
of reproduction, it is fair to argue there is a deca-
dence of racial type. The issue hinges on the defi-
nition of “a higher type.” Is the highest type of
humanity that which merges itself in religious
mysticism, and condemns itself to sterility ? Or
that which becomes addicted to spiritualism, or
logarithms, or Greek choruses, and grows too
learned and superior to breed ? Or that which
worships money so madly as to put the pursuit of
wealth above the interests of the individual, the
family, and the State ? Or that which is so selfish
that it seeks only the pleasure and not the respon-
sibilities of sex life? If these are the “highest
types,” it may be granted that, with an “improve-
ment ” which means their increase, the popula-
tion-rate will dwindle. But they are not. The
highest type of man will always be, in the first
place, a healthy animal. No man or woman who
is not a healthy animal can fairly be called a “ high
type.” Graft on to animalism (which is com-
parable to the rough briar stock on which the
finest of roses are grown) the softening qualities of
aestheticism and spirituality—the senses which
ask for the beauty of materials and the beauty of
dreams in life —and the perfect type evolves.
* * * * *
Modern civilisation begins to recognise this. The
passion for physical culture among even the most
highly educated shows a sane striving for the old
pagan ideal of a healthy mind in a healthy body.
The modern philosopher is “ the poet of the body
as well as of the soul.” There is not much reason
to fear with Mr. Barclay that the evolution of
civilisation will necessarily tend to sterility.
By-products of the evolutionary process will
prove infertile from misfortune as well as
from choice. The fine society lady will
imitate that peach tree which produces gorgeous
double blossoms but no fruit. The decadent
man, his natural, human paternal feeling
mutilated, will be content to leave no posterity.
But they do not represent the main body of
civilised humanity, which is to-day more rational
in its ideas, more keen for the vigor of body and
mind, better equipped for the evolution of a
higher type than, probably, at any previous
period of its history. This twentieth century is
marked conspicuously by its sense of duty—duty
not dependent on superstition or king-worship,
but on faith in humanity—and it is not going to
commit Race Suicide.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Just the Time for Arbitration.
Australia has had the fruits of three very good
years poured into its hold, and now it has to find
anew centre of gravity, so to speak ; and that is
a process which always means unrest. Practically
everybody admits that all the benefits of a pros-
perous time should not belong to the men into
whose pockets the extra profits fall in the first
place. When copper goes beyond £IOO, the mine
owner is expected to pay something more than he
does when the metal sells for £SO ; even such an
old-fashioned, Conservative company as Wallaroo
and Moonta has its sliding scale, and such a
modern, aggressive company as Mt. Lyell met
the rise in copper with a voluntary rise in
wages. But there are employers who themselves
only indirectly benefit —the employers who are not
what the daily papers call primary producers—
and the case is more complicated when their
employees want to share in the general pros-
perity. Take the manufacturer, for instance —
the man to whom the tariff doesn’t give reason-
able Protection. He has to compete with
foreigners who are not having a specially pros-
perous time, and whose employees are not, there-
fore, asking for any rise in wages. Possibly the
local manufacturer’s sales are a little larger ; with
High Protection he might even be able to command
rather higher prices. But in many cases he can’t
now, because the very prosperity ot the country
has attracted the attention of some new foreigner,
who thereupon comes, in to fight for a fresh market.
If the local manufacturer had sufficient Protec-
tion, any fair Arbitration Court would have to
take the general prosperity into account and
award higher wages. But even without higher
Protection, there are heaps of cases in which
higher wages would be awarded—mostly in cases
where there is some sort of natural Protection.
These are just the circumstances in which Arbi-
tration ought to have the field. Conditions have
changed—in some cases more, in some cases less—
and wages ought to change with them ; and only
Arbitration can say what the latter change ought
to be. Strikes or lockouts can’t, of course, arrive
at j 11st conclusions, because strikes arid lockouts
are settled, not by the reasoning of brains, but
by the limitations of bellies. It was the misfor-
tune of Abrbitration in Australia that it was
introduced just at what happened to be a
time of drought and disaster. In Maoriland
award after award was given in favor of the work-
men, and they thought the same thing was going
to happen in N.S. Wales. It didn’t. Things
had been uniformly prosperous in Maoriland, and
the awards kept pace with that prosperity ; and,
as the prosperity has not been checked by waste-
ful strikes, the awards have not had to be inter-
fered with. But the same Reason which did that
for Maoriland workmen usually sent the N.S.
Wales workmen away empty and dissatisfied ; so
Arbitration, which continued, and still continues,
triumphant in Maoriland, has fallen into such
disfavor this side that it is almost aban-
doned. Just at the time when workmen ought
to take it up enthusiastically, and reap the
advantages which it has won for the Maori-
lander, they turn their faces from it, and
adopt the wasteful strike. Or, if they don’t
strike, they talk strike. Sometimes they get a
concession; sometimes they don’t. Whether
they do or don’t depends little upon the justice
of their claims, and a concession got that way is
altogether unreliable. Won by the sword, any-
thing gained must be defended by the sword ; and
Australian workmen ought to know well enough
by this time who in the end wins in a struggle
of that sort. There never was a finer lot of
unionists in Australia than 13 or 14 years
ago, and never before nor since so well-
organised a lot. Yet in the series of struggles
that took place then they failed ; and so they will
fail again with the strike weapon. Their business
now is to follow the Maoriland lead, and on the
rising tide of prosperity to use the Arbitration
principle for all it is worth ; and there is no
reason whatever to suppose that the results that
followed in Maoriland will not follow in Aus-
tralia. Anyhow, now is above all times the time
to try it.

The Queensland Position.
Reluctantly—because there is, as a rule, no
good to be got out of an argument with another
newspaper—The Bulletin returns to the subject
of the Labor party debacle in Queensland and the
connection of the Queensland Worker therewith.
The position in the northern State is just now an
anxious one. Democracy threatens to cut its own
throat, and the paper which represents the
workers’ cause is busy hurrying on that
tragedy. Since that paper is not owned by
private capitalists, but is the property of the
trades unions, and its proprietary has therefore
no selfish ends to serve, perhaps an appeal
to reason and to facts may yet be of some use.
Certainly, if the Worker pursues its present
policy, the democratic army in Queensland at
the next State election will be cleft in
twain, and the ultimate result may be a Con-
servative reaction. But is there not time for
that probably well-meaning but sadly-mistaken
organ to take a look round and see things in
their proper light? The Worker, replying to
a Bulletin review of the Federal election re-
sults (which incidentally blamed the Queensland
extremists, headed by the Worker, for the
Queensland set-back) makes these statements:—
The Bulletin is jealous of the Worker.
That is a self-evident absurdity.
The Bulletin cares only for Protection, and nothing
for the other issue of an Australian policy.
That is also a palpable misstatement. The B.
puts Protection first, as the necessary basis for
all Labor legislation. In the Federal elections,
that it did not make that the only issue is shown
by the fact—among others—that it did not
support those Victorian Laborites who ran on
faith-breaking lines against the men who sup-
ported the Watson Government, and was gene-
rally not in full sympathy with the Victorian
Political Labor League, though that body was
absolutely pledged to Protection. The Bulletin
is for Protection all the time, but it is also for
fair play and common-sense.
Cook (N.S.W.) is in the same position as Kidston (Q.),
and Kidston deserves the same censure as Cook.
This is pathetic in its folly. Cook left the Labor
party when a portfolio was offered him. Since
then he has gradually drifted into the position of
being the deputy-leader of the Anti-Labor party,
and the spouter from a hundred platforms of the
venomous political lies which make up Anti-
Sosh. Kidston took office as a member of a Labor
coalition Government, with the full blessing of
his party ; he now holds office as a member
and with the full support of the majority—of that
Labor party.
Deakin, generalissimo of the army representing The
Bulletin’s policy, was almost annihilated. . The
results of the elections threaten us with a Reid
Government.
This allows of a clear diagnosi i of the Worker’s
case. The paper evidently suffers from absolute
blindness. Deakin personally polled the largest
vote for the House of Heps. His candidates were
almost invariably successful in every State. That
there were not more of them was on account of
his refusal to attack the seat of any Labor
member or Labor candidate with a reasonable
claim. In N.S.W. not a single DEAKiN-ite member
failed to return to the House of Reps. But Reid-
ites were ousted in all directions. Yet the
Worker sees a rout for Deakin and a possible
victory for Reid ! Is the wish father to the
thought ? Does the Worker likewise wish for a
Philp victory at the State elections in a cut-off-
my-nose-to-spite-my-face spirit, that since the
people won’t stand the Worker brand of Social-
ism they’d best be cursed with a Conservative
administration ? That seems to be the position ;
and it is a very silly and very impracticable
position for a Labor paper to take up.
Affairs in Fiji.
An influential resident of Fiji writes :
The blackbirding industry in the Pacific Islands vas
supposed to have been effectually suppressed, but it still
thrives as a Government institution in Fiji. The Govern-
ment there is administered solely in the interests of the
Colonial Sugar Refining Company by an irresponsible
autocrat from Downing-street. Even the fountain of
Justice is under his despotic sway—for it is simply a
farce that an administrator should sit in solemn judg-
ment on a matter in which, as a member of the Execu-
tive, he has already obediently endorsed the action of his
official director. Governor im Tiiurn opened his career
as Czar of Fiji by promising, with an oratorical blare of
trumpets, all sorts of reforms and improvements. But
his political promissory notes have been dishonored.
Upon the defects of the native policy Governor im
Tiiurn was particularly eloquent. With a flood of
rhetoric he harangued the native chiefs on the subject of
Patriotism. He pathetically lamented that the Fijian
race threatened to become extinct in 40 years, and he
accused the chiefs of being responsible for this calamity
by then- oppressive domination. “The Fijian people are
perishing,” he declared, “chiefly because they are not
allowed any liberty to think and act for themselves.”
The whole address was simply part of an opera
burlesque ; for the chiefs are absolute puppets in the
hands of the Governor, who can supersede, abolish, or
deport them at his own sweet will. If he deports them
illegally, it is through the agency of the Habeas Corpus
Act that remedy is obtained —not by any uprising of an
indignant outraged people, of which there is not the
remotest danger. But the insincerity of Governor Im
Thurn’s professions is more effectively demonstrated by
hi - subsequent policy. He has just compacted with the
chiefs to compel gangs of 300 men to construct a
Government road between Suva and Navua. The pay-
ment given wall (the men believe) amount to about
four shillings per man per annum. The forced labor
would not be justified if the pay were £1 per day. The
W'ork is very heavy—clearing big timber and digging
drains through a mangrove morass intersected by a net-
work of big roots. The bill of fare provided by the
Government, regardless of cost, is four biscuits per man
night and morning, and a slightly more substantial
midday feast. The Fijian, in his native lair, has to work
throughout the year by a Government card, which is
exhibited in the “Mayor’s” house in every native town.
The natives pointed out that they were so tied down that
no opportunity was given them to provide clothing for
themselves and families. The Governor, therefore, merci-
fully granted them absolute freedom with regard to
choice of work for the months of November and Decem-
ber, and, ever since, this concession has been inscribed
on their official syllabus of work. Fearful of the terrors
of prosecution by their chiefs—with the Government
acting in concert —the men obeyed the summons to
give their labor “ for that which satisfieth not” ; but in
November the natives of one district claimed the freedom
betowed in their Magna Charta, to seek work to which
some pay w'as attached that would enable them to obtain
necessary clothing. They were reported to the Govern-
ment, which at once ordered the chief to deal with them
in the veilewai (native court). The men, hearing of this,
sent a deputation to the Governor, who was communing
with nature in the distant mountain solitude of
Nadarivatu, and pathetically appealed to him to merci-
fully withhold the terrors of the veilewai. They had
done no wrong, they had simply followed the card of
instructions that he and his predecessors had issued. If
he took back the gift of two months freedom, and
ordained that they and their families must go naked,
they had not refused to obey ; and if he said that they
must give their labor “without money and without
price,” and submit to semi-starvation, they had not
refused acquiescence. So they petitioned him to with-
draw his order for their prosecution at the veilewai for
having simply acted in consonance with his own direc-
tions. The appeal was fruitless ; the men returned to
their homes, only to be forthwith dragged away to the
veilewai, where they were ruthlessly robbed of the
shilling or two that represented their total fortune —
with the alternative that those who could not pay the
fine would have to spend their Christmas month in gaol.
“ Slaves cannot breathe in England”—and they must
find some difficulty in breathing - in the British depen-
dency of Fiji. The Fijian people are perishing chiefy
because (under the tyranny of British administration)
they are allowed ho liberty to think or act for then-

Sosh. at Close Quarters.
The Sydney papers lately got red in the face
screaming that all was lost if the country didn’t vote
Anti-Sosh. The Bulletin’s view was that, instead
of throwing bricks at Socialism, these papers
and their followers would walk arm-in-arm with
the alleged monster, and call him a good fellow,
the very first time he showed himself. And that
is just what they have done. It is less than a
month since the whole pack were in full cry ; yet
already they are pouring out sympathetic para-
graphs over the recommendation of the Sydney
municipal electric-supply committee that its
biggest competitor should be bought out. In the
matter of electric light, Sydney is supplied
both by Socialism (in the shape of the
City Council) and Private Enterprise. Both
had . their own works and mains and ad-
ministrative staff's, and the arrangement was
costly for all parties, and absurd; instead of
competition making things good for the con-
sumer, the dual system meant a waste both in
capital outlay and running expenses, and rock-
bottom prices for light and power were impossible.
As Private Enterprise hadn’t a hope of buying
out the Socialistic Enterprise, it was proposed
that Private Enterprise should sell out; and, with
the approval of some of the very people who had
represented Socialism as a devouring monster, the

Stealing the Yarra.
Melbourne MeteQpQKtan Board of Works and
the State River and Water Supply Commission
(“S* int .° existence under the Yic. Water Act
ot 1905) are in conflict over a matter in which, for
once, the Board of Works is in the right The
quarrei is over Melbourne’s Yarra. The Board of
Works Act, passed many years ago, gave the
Board certain powers over the river, and it
assumed control. The control was marked by
the same wise policy that old Bard of Works
. Titzgibbon displayed regarding parks.
.Private enterprise ” was not to be allowed to
appropriate in any way any portion of the river.
How the State Rivers Commission seems to have
decided on a policy of slicing up the rivers for the
benefit of private speculators. The first cut was
made 11 years ago, before the days of the Commis-
sion. A milling co. at Dight’s Falls was given by
the (government power to build a weir,
cut a race, and divert the river to drive
machinery. This was done, and the river for
half-a-mile above the weir is one of the deadest,
weirdest-smelling patches of water in the con-
tinent. The Board of Works protested at the
time, but was silenced with a promise that in 11
years, when the authority came up for renewal, it
should have a voice. The 11 years expired last
October; but the Government, knowing that the
Board would not renew the authority, discovered
that the Commission was the correct body, ignored
the Board, and the concession was renewed.
Again the Board objected. Counsel’s opinion
was sought by the Government, and, of course,
obtained in favor of its action. Counsel said that
the Water Act vested the sole control of the river
in the Governor-in-Council, acting on the recom-
mendation of the State Rivers Commission. The
Board of Works rushed off to a rival counsel, and
got an opinion showing that in it was vested the
soil, banks, and bed of the stream, and in the
Commission was vested the water. Therefore, no
authority to divert water could be issued without
the concurrence of the Board—concurrence which
the Board was determined not to give. Still, the
Board was ignored and the authority issued. While
this controversy was raging, one of the Board
people spied a notice in the Government Gazette
stating that permission had been granted to a pri-
vate individual to build another weir still higher
up the riyer and divert water. The Board at the
present time is fighting Swinburne, Minister of
Water Supply, and the Commission, with teeth
and claws and counsel’s opinions. The Board
sees clearly that if the Government is going to
hand over the right to build a weir to any person
who is able to get at its ear in the approved
manner, the citizens of Melbourne, whose in-
terests the Board is supposed to guard, will be
defrauded out of the power to make those improve-
ments and alterations that would turn the Yarra
into a decent river and a picturesque lake pro-
ductive of the electric power that means money.
The Government stands in the way, though the
Board is really moderate in what its asks. It
desires the Crown to revoke all grants made and
issue no more, or else to insert in all grants a
clause enabling the Board to buy out the holder
on the basis of “capital spent on improvements
or works, and not on profits or share values at the
date of acquirement.” This isj a fair business
offer, and if it should be refused, then the
Board should show that it is really in earnest in
its desire to safeguard the interests of the citizens
by raising such a shindy as will compel the
Government to yield and give up the habit of
making its friends presents out of the people’s
property.

Woman and the Law.
A recent decision of aNew York (U.S.A.) Grand
Jury that the husband who kills his wife’s lover
is a justifiable homicide, represents, in the rough,
the spirit, if not the letter, of civilised law at the
present day. In some European countries such
slaying is expressly legalised. In the eyes of the
British law, the husband who, in the first heat of
the discovery, hills his wife’s paramour, is held
practically guiltless. The same spirit exists
in other juristic systems. But it must rapidly
pass away with the progress of civilisa-
tion, for it _is essentially illogical in com-
munities which recognise “women’s rights.”
How illogical it is easy to understand if the con-
verse proposition were maintained that in the case
of marital infidelity the wife should have the right
to kill her husband’s paramour. Early ideas of
marriage, of course, presumed male possession of
the female as the basis of the contract. When
courtship was with a waddy or a hatchet,
matrimony was merely a matter of possession,
more or less stable under differing conditions of
food supply. When the world had reached even
the standard of the Greek civilisation, the woman
was still mostly a chattel. The ease with which
the women of one nation transferred themselves
from the men of their own state to the
victorious warriors of another, shows the pre-
valence of this feeling. With the develop-
ment of the idea that woman was a human
creature as well as man, the proprietorial
idea of marriage was modified somewhat, but not
very materially. Wives could not exactly be
bought and sold like kine, but they were more
the possessions than the mates of their husbands.
Even monogamy did not alter this idea much,
and in the present day, when woman either has a
vote or is recklessly sacrificing her best bonnet in
resisting the police so as to get one, the possessory
idea still lingers. But with the full acceptance of
the conclusions which follow from a recognition of
what are called “woman’s rights,” logic will
force a change of view. If woman is the equal of
man, she has the same rights as he in regard to
the transference of her affections. Educated sen-
timent will, naturally, always revolt against the
idea of a woman having another lover whilst
living under her husband’s roof, and will condone
a good deal of the wildness of passion shown by
a husband discovering such circumstances ; but it
will refuse to consider infidelity in a married
woman a crime worthy of capital punishment.
The logic of the political and social emancipation
of woman has to be faced, unsettling as it is to
traditions which have come down from the trog-
lodyte period of human history.

Signs of “ The Times.”
Grant Hervey writes :
It is significant that, while the Calico Jimmy press of
Australia is making violent efforts to persuade itself that
Protection is not so bad as it used to say it was, the lead-
■ng papers of Britain are likewise beginning to observe
that Foreign Trade is not nearly so valuable as the Cobden
tradition represents it to be. Freetrade was established
in England when the Times somersaulted from Protection ;
and now it appears that Protection is likely to oust the
bogus Manchester gospel, for the old paper has somer-
aulted backwards in the direction of its original creed.
The following excerpts from a Times leading article,
entitled Our Trade with Germany,” go to show how
completely the Thunderer has revolved on its fiscal axis
The only finished article which, apparently, we ex-
port to Germany in any considerable quantity, is
machinery. Raw material and the instruments of indus.
tual competition thus form the great bulk of what
we send to Germany, while we receive from
her the industrial products made by German
skill from these same materials and with these
instruments, and in the process furnish employment
and sustenance to a large German industrial population.
In other words, we stand to-day, in our trade with Ger-
many, in the position of an industrially undeveloped
country trading with another country on a far higher
level of industrial efficiency. . . . Have we really sunk
to a level of industrial capacity so far lower than that
of the Germans that we are only fit nowadays to act
as their hewers of wood and drawers of water, and to
supply them with a market for the finished goods which
we are incapable of making ourselves? . . . But, if we
are not industrially on a different plane to the Germans,
what other cause can we assign for the state of our trade
with Germany besides the deliberate manipulation of
trade by the German tariff and the entire absence of any
countervailing regulations or basis for negotiations on
our part? The German tariff, by excluding our manu-
factures, forces us to discharge our indebtedness to Ger-
many by the export of the raw materials of our indus-
tries. The free import of German manufactures into this
country, by displacing our manufactures, diminishes our
own demand for raw materials, and thus accentuates the
process. So effective is the power thus exercised upon
the course of trade that the relative positions of the two
countries have become completely reversed in a genera-
tion. Is this result one that can" possibly be considered
beneficial to the people of this country ? ”
Substitute “Australia” for “Britain,” and those re-
marks might apply to the Commonwealth with nearly
the same force with which they should smite the muddy
intellect of J. Bull. Things have changed as regards the
relations between Britain and Germany. Cobden pro-
phesied better than he imagined when he wrote as
follows in 1838: “ Prussia must be looked upon as a
rising State, whose greatness will be based upon the
Commercial League” ( i.e ., the Zollverein). It is upon
that identical basis that the German Empire has been
constructed ; and, on present appearances, it looks as if
Britain might be a German appanage before the end cf
the present century. The Zollverein, or Customs Union,
although planned originally in 1818, only came into full
force in 1833. But id was Bismarck’s emphatic tariff
of 1879 that woke the Fatherland into full and unanimous
blast.
In connection with the latter-day development of Ger-
many, it is interesting- to consider the position of Austria.
Austria was the only German State omitted from the
Customs Union of 1833, and now Austria looks so much
like a defunct corpse that Kaiser Bill inclines to
measure it for a nice German-made cofin. The Holy
Roman Empire, which used to sprawl over the map of
Europe like an elephant reclining in a pie-dish, is abso-
lutely certain to become a mere fragment of the brand-
new Empire that Old Blood-and-Iron Bismarck rivetted
together. Whether the Empire will find a southern road
to the sea via Constantinople or not is a moot point, but
it seems pretty certain that it will get Trieste. Belgium
and Holland will probably be drawn into the Imperial
vortex ; and Britain will encounter the boss scrap of its
life-time, if ever it has the ill-luck to fall out with an
antagonist whose sea-coast must ultimately extend from
Antwerp to Memel.
Whether a naval Sedan awaits Britain it is hard to
say, but it will be a black outlook for Australia when
Britain has to mass all her floating tin-ware in the North
Sea. The moral sticks out like the bowsprit of Saturn.
Let Australia quit being- a market for the goods of other
nations ; and—by establishing a prohibitive tariff—let it
build up industries and navies of its own. Britain must
drift to destruction, if it won’t stop drifting ; but that is
no reason why the Commonwealth should follow suit.

The Fatal Bath.
At St. Kilda (Vic.), on New Year’s Day, a
girl swimming in the baths suddenly sank and
was drowned. At the inquest, it was elicited that
the girl had fainted in the water. If assistance
had been rendered promptly, she would have been
saved; but no assistance was given because,
although the girl sank in only 4ft. of water, the
attendant, who was told she had gone down,
“could not swim herself.” Presumably, also, she
couldn’t wade. She ran for one of the superin-
tendents, who, being a careful woman, sent for
the police. Three big constables were collected
and trooped into the baths, to the horror of the
undrowned bathers. So much time had elapsed
that there was no need to look for the body—it
was found floating on the top of the water. The
constables worked nobly at resuscitatory measures,
but their labor was useless. Coroner Candler
expressed a most emphatic opinion that the
arrangements at the bath were inadequate for the
protection of bathers; but that means nothing.
In most businesses where there is a risk of human
life the people carrying them on are required to
know the rudiments of the game. Engine-drivers
require certificates, so do ships’ officers ; cabmen
are licensed, so are" tram-men. Attendants at
baths should also be licensed, and have to pass an
examination in swimming.

Are We Going to Lock Our Doors?
“ Chiburo ” on the above subject:—
I do not think that Thb Bulletin needs any arguments
to convince it of the necessity for the proper preparation
of the manhood of this country for defence. In the issue
of 31/10/’O6 there are two or three pointed references to
this question—a question which we will be called on to
answer fully and clearly some of these days. When we
find the enemy knocking at our gates it will be too late to
talk wildly about our inaccessibility, or our great natural
resources ; we will want to fight, and our fighting will be
of a strenuous and bitter kind. If we do not fight sooner
or later, we vijill be the only nation in history that has
not had to fight.
Now, I am the wife of a man that has been a soldier in
Australia for about 14 years, and I have three brothers in
various branches of the defence forces, so perhaps I may
make a suggestion. Agreed that we want a national
army, not a few men who are patriotic enough to risk
the loss of their civil billets or the loss of their wages for
the six or eight days in camp each year. Let us take the
case of Bill Jones. He lives in a town which contains,
say, 2000 inhabitants within two miles of tne post office,
i 'is town has therefore, ipso facto, come under the opera-
tion of the “ Defence of Australia Act, 1907,” and Bill is
bound to be called upon to serve. (Of course, if he hates
Australia so much that he would just as soon it becomes
an Asiatic pro-consulate, let him clear out.)
Well, the local enrolling officer has the Income-tax
return of names, and the Census returns, and the Elec-
toral-rolls, and he sees “ W. Jones” in some or all of
them. He makes it his business to find out whether Bill
is in any corps. If not, then Bill has to come before him
and be enrolled. If the poor chap has only one leg, or
has got a “heart” through smoking cigarettes, let him
produce from a duly qualified medical officer, at his own
expense, a certificate to that effect, or prove the fact to
the satisfaction of the enrolling officer. (The existence
of only one leg should be evident to a blind enrolling
officer.) But assume, for the sake of Australia, that W.
Jones is healthy, and that he recognises that it is “ up
to him ” to serve as a soldier. He appears before the
enrolling officer, and something like this passes : “ What’s
your trade, Jones?” “Baker.” “Right, the Army
Service Corps want eight men. You will report to the
Officer Commanding at the drill-shed at 8 o’clock on
Tuesday. Good day.”
Or suppose Bill is a shoeing-smith and farrier: “All
right, the Light Horse want five recruits, and the Field
Artillery want three; which would you rather join ? ”
Having a trade that makes him useful as a farrier in
either, and some mates in the Artillery, he goes for the
latter. When he joins he finds that he has to make him-
self efficient in his duties and in shooting and drill for
three years consecutively, or five years not consecutively.
If at the end of his three years he is promoted to N.C.0.,
he may stay on in the Force for another three years with
a bonus to compensate him for the extra work and
knowledge that are required of him. If he has aspirations
to become an officer, he must still serve his three years
in the ranks, and at the expiration of that period he will,
if he has paid attention to his work, be fit to pass the
first examination for commissioned rank. This will
include a certain knowledge, so that when a man is an
officer he will be able to write a clear report, to read and
act upon an order, and both to read and (perhaps more
important) to draw a map.
When our friend goes up to poll his vote, he will be
asked to show that he is serving, and the onus of
proof will be on him.
Then the officers commanding companies will not
have the heart-breaking job of keeping their ranks
full, nor will they have the raw recruit drifting in at
all times and seasons through the year, unsettling the
training of the older soldiers in the higher branches.
Recruits will be drafted to corps at stated intervals,
and will be ready for inspection by the proper officer
in, say, six months, and, if the company doesn’t
“shape,” the company officer will be asked in a nasty
way for an explanation.
There’s a lot in it, especially for Bill, who would
miss quite a lot of his present evenings with a cigar-
ette and a lamp-post.
Really Free Education.
The advocates of free education in N.S.W. State
schools, though they have won the battle in
Parliament, are, it seems, to be deprived of the
fruits of victory. The beaten party, aided by
bureaucratic machinery, has, more or less clan-
destinely, been carrying on a crusade against the
Parliamentary resolution since the night it was
carried; and has, it must be confessed, materially
succeeded. In city, suburbs, and country the
Department, or its officers, have inaugurated school
funds for this and that, to which the children have
been invited to—voluntarily, of course —subscribe.
These funds have entailed 3d., at least, and, in some
cases, 6d. a week in payment, and the money has
been devoted to ornamenting school walls, provid-
ing new window blinds, or extending or improving
the school grounds. The latest is that certain
paraphernalia required by the new education
syllabus are declared by the Department to be so
expensive that the children will be obliged to con-
tribute 50 per cent, of the cost. When Parliament
passed the Free Education Act it meant Free
Education in reality, and the members whose
votes carried the Bill are justified in demanding
that the Government shall see that the Act is
duly administered. It is not duly administered
if the amount of the old fees is extracted by the
Department or its officers from the children under
some new name.
Australians should note the facts stated at a
public meeting held at Durban, in Natal, just
before the last S’African mail left. Some years
ago Natal wanted B. Smith’s cheap, reliable
nigger to make the land fat and happy, and, as
Natal is very proud of its “loyalty to the
Empire,” it decided that the Indian coolie was
the best short-cut to rotundity and happiness.
Natal got the Indian, accordingly, but it hasn’t
got either the rotundity or the happiness, and
the Durban meeting was held to see whether
anything could be done. In trade, it was
stated, the Hindus are now twice as numer-
ous as the Europeans, and in agriculture four
times as numerous. Instead of fattening the
whites, the Hindus have grown fat themselves,
and the whites find themselves getting poorer and
poorer; so that the idea of repatriation had
to be put aside as hopeless. It would be
as easy, perhaps easier, for the Hindus—several
of them well-nigh millionaires—to repatriate the
whites. There are, moreover, 38,000 Hindu
women in the colony ; so that, if immigration
could be stopped dead, the trouble would live on.
“ We shall have to fight for it in the end,” one
speaker groaned ; and, though Natal doesn’t even
yet like to admit it, it can suggest no other way
out of the awful mess.

’Fills letter comes with the good old name of
Peter Lalor at the foot:—
I desire to put before you the objects and platform of
the newly-formed “Australia for Australians S ciety.”
The objects are to encourage the feelings of patriotism
and love of our country. The platform is :—
1. An Australian Navy.
2. A Citizen Army, including Compulsory Service, and
a Federal Arsenal.
3. High Protection.
4. Use of Australian-made goods alone.
5. Taking over of the Northern Territory on any terms
whatever.
6. Federal Land Tax.
7. Immigration Bureau, on the style of Canada’s.
8. Two Transcontinental Railways.
9. Elective Ministries.
10. White Australia.
11. Gradual abolition of State Houses and Governors.
12. The encouragement of the idea of Australia as a
nation, and not as a dependency of Britain.
13. No further sending of contingents, as Australia
needs all her manhood for her own self-defence.
Your adhesion and support at general elections, both
State and Federal, to the foregoing platform is earnestly
requested, and all are desired to become members with-
out delay. No fee is necessary—only the name and ad-
dress must be sent, together with a stamped addressed
envelope to return a certificate of membership. Address
to acting Hon. Sec., 353 Church-street, Richmond, Mel-
bourne, Victoria.
The Bulletin heartily advises Australians to
join.

Every year sees an increasing number of foreign
students attending the German universities and
technical schools. The manufacturers have worked
hard to have the technical schools and universities
completely closed to foreigners, on the ground
that they only come to learn German methods in
order to cut the throat of German enterprise in
foreign lands. Now the German students have
taken up the agitation, and demand that the
foreigners should pay increased fees, and
that they themselves have a preference in
the assignment of places in laboratories. The
foreign student can only learn German
methods in the universities and technical
schools. No German manufacturer will give any
young foreigner employment in his factory, even
if he works for nothing. The fool British manu-
facturer, on the other hand, always prefers foreign
clerks and operatives if they show signs of better
training or an inclination to work for lower wages.
So it has come about that you will find the best of
English methods in full blast in Germany, but
rarely a sign of German up-to-dateness about an
English factory, excepting such as are run by
German capitalists and mostly manned by German
workmen—like some of the tobacco factories in
London, in which English is rarely spoken outside
the order department.

All his comic-opera legislation was dropped by
Vic. Premier Bent when the congestion of the
closing hours of the last session provided an ex-
cuse. The Boxing Suppression Bill, introduced
for the purpose of placating Judkins and co., fell
in the first round and was promptly counted out.
As a matter of fact, the Boxing Bill had never
been prepared. Several times Bent and Mackey
announced that it was all ready for presentation
to the House; but, all the same, nobody ever saw
a copy of the precious measure. The Public
Meetings Orderly Conduct Bill, by which any
person who rose to ask a candidate a question
might be treated as a criminal, was also dropped
suddenly; though it is generally believed that Bent
really desired to pass the terrorist scheme into law.
About the only useful measure lost through lack
of time was the amendment of the Vagrancy Law.
At present, criminals have a free run in Vic.
unless something definite can be fixed on them.
But Bent spoiled the Bill to change this by
making it ridiculously stringent. As introduced,
any new arrival with £100 in his possession might
be arrested and awarded two years’ gaol, if he
failed to prove that he had obtained the money
honestly.
Rev. G. T. Walden, president of the Australasian
Christian Endeavor Convention, returned to
Sydney, the other day, after a tour through the
United States, a confirmed White Australian :
Intense excitement existed in America over the ques.
tion of the admission of the Japanese into the schools.
Not only in San Francisco was this a burning question,
but right through the States the feeling against the
colored races was reaching a critical point. The
Southern States feared that the Federal legisla-
tion would attempt to compel them to admit
negroes into the schools for whites, instead of keeping
them in their separate schools, and the Japanese question
would probably bring matters to a head. America was
reaping the crop from the seed of black slavery she had
herself sown. The result of his observations had made
him more convinced than ever of the soundness of the
policy of White Australia. The negroes were now con-
gregating in the town, and would not work in the fields,
and the negresses had refused to do housework in many
places. In New York whole districts were almost ex-
clusively in the possession of black people, the whites
having moved out in consequence of their advent.
One Chamber of Commerce is very like
another. All worship a goddess called Trade.
She sits on a throne of shoddy, wearing a rolled-
gold crown and “all-wool" garments made of
cotton, and her devotees pour libations of drugged
tonics and adulterated sauces. So it is not sur-
prising to find that the London Chamber of Com-
merce raises against the Commonwealth Com-
merce Act very much the same wail as is raised
by the Chambers in Melbourne and Sydney.
The most frigid insolence lies in the moan raised
because Australia has demanded that goods im-
ported hither from abroad shall declare honestly
the country in which they are made. “To indi-
cate the country of origin,” say the commercial
giants of England, “ will indicate the source to
buyers, with consequent loss of trade to British
firms." It is apparent that an immense amount
of “ British ” commerce consists in buying things
from America, France, Germany, or Belgium, and
selling them to Australia falsely disguised as
British goods.

“Caber,” on the political situation in Queens-
land :
Glad to see that you have become fully seized of the
fact that the Brisbane Worker just now is the greatest
foe to Democracy in Queensland. Your shovel is grating
on the bedrock of the sacred truth when, in “Plain
English ” (3/l/’O7), you warn the voters of Bananaland
that the extremists on either side of the political rope are
pulling with, and not against, each other. The Trades
Hall triumvirate kept the Continuous Ministry in power
for 13 years, and would have them there at date, were it
not that they disgusted their own friends. The Worker,
dictated to by the Trades Hall, hounded down
Labor’s truest friends, because they would not subscribe
to a lot of tommy-rot, borrowed from Karl Marx or
Morrison Davidson, and as inapplicable to Queensland as
a mustard plaster to an oil painting. When the 15
Laborites were returned in 1903 the junta contracted a
bad spell of swelled head, and went against everything
not emanating from the Trades Hall. Lane’s motto—
“ He that is not with us is against us ” —was worked for all
it was worth. Brainy men chanced occasionally to
the Worker editorial chair —notably Blackwell and
Higgs —but they found their hands manacled with
the press-gang chain of the little tin idols who
ran the entire show in Turbot-street. One of the truest
friends of Labor, the late John Fogarty, always met with
the most violent opposition of Hinchcliffe and co., and
had the ban of the Worker. Bob King, J. M. Cross and
Jack Hoolan tried to reason the party into practical
politics, and were cast forth ; Wilkinson started to think
for himself, and when next he stood for Ipswich the
Worker wrote of hjm as “ impossible.” Ryott-Maughan,
another sterling Democrat, was hounded down, and when
old man Glassey refused to come to heel, Hinchcliffe
went to battle against him in Bundaberg and came back
to the Trades Hall on his shield. At the first Federal
elections the Worker commanded that only three candi-
dates — Dawson, Higgs and Stewart —should be voted for,
and it let Ferguson slip in. To the virulent ravings of
the Worker, its silly references to gods and dogs, and its
hide-bound Conservatism, Chataway, Sayers, St. Ledger,
Foxton, and Sinclair owe their seats. And so satisfied it
appears to be with its bungling incapacity as a leader of
thought that it threatens to oppose Kidston and Airey !
And it will keep on in its mischievous meddling until it
reduces the Labor party to one—in the Upper House.
Melbourne builders’ strike moves slowly along.
This Thursday begins the 11th week since
the bricklayers and plasterers and laborers
demanded shorter hours and stopped tvork. It is
five weeks since the builders, hoping to end the
strike, closed down all works—including brick-
works and timber-yards. Since then every poli-
tical person in Victoria has taken a hand as peace-
maker, with no result. The strikers have turned
a deaf ear to the suggestions and exhortations
alike of the Press, Bent, and the State Labor
party. Public sympathy in the beginning was
dead against the strikers, but their steady fight
has caused the public to veer round, and
people are now coming to the conclusion that
there must be something in the strike wdien the
men are willing to stick the way they have done.
When Bent, Mackey, Prendergast, Peacock,
Justice Cussen, and others intervened, the men
asked for a conference, and the contractors said
“Yes, if you give in on the 44 hours,” which, of
course, was the reason for the strike. Then the
men said, “We will agree to a Wages Board
without the ‘ reputable employer ’ clause and
without appeal," but the employers would not
listen. The men, at the instance of Bent and
Prendergast, agreed to a Wages Board, with a
Supreme Court Judge as chairman. Justice Cussen
was appointed to the chair. The employers agreed
to this on condition that the men resumed work at
the old rate —48 hours a week. The men said
“No. Let us have a decision first. We bind our-
selves to accept the decision whatever it is.” The
employers would not trust the men, and refused
the Board. Now the contractors have had to
make a move. Summer is wearing on and the
buildings, half finished as they are, are weather-
ing considerably. Work has been resumed ; but
with about a dozen men. The employers cannot
get anything like sufficient hands.

“ Bobstay ” writes :
The merging of Maoriland into the Common wealth being
outside of the range of politics at present, it is high time
that some arrangement between that State and the Com-
monwealth was entered into as regards the purely inter-
state trade. At the present time.no foreign vessel can
trade along the coast of Maoriland without conforming to
the laws of the State in their entirety, and in the
Commonwealth every ship trading inter-State only must
pay Australian wages and carry a crew on Australian
articles, with certificated officers, according to scale.
But each country regards the other as absolutely foreign,
with the result that foreign ships can run from Auckland
to Melbourne, Hobart, or Sydney on their own articles
and under their particular and peculiar conditions. In
consequence, the timber trade between Maoriland and
the Commonwealth is falling into the hands of foreigners!, i
mostly Norwegian. Twenty vessels could be named at
present engaged in this trade, and the number is likely
to increase. Half-a-dozen can be seen to-day in Port
Jackson. Apart from the sentiment suggesting that a
purely local trade like this should belong wholly to
our own sailors, the Australian owners are seri-
ously handicapped by the fact that they have
to pay wages on the Australian scale, while the
foreigners are manned by foreign crews on foreign
rates of pay. An ordinary seaman—notanA.B.—is paid
on an Australian ship £fi a month. On a Norweigan
barque he would not get £l. Another aspect is that this
trade, which should be the nursery for an Australian
mercantile marine (it’s the only trade, practically, in which
service in sad can be obtained) is being shut against any
Australian or Maoriland boy who wishes to go to sea.

Rumor has of late been busy with the
name of Bland Holt. He was going to leave
Australia. He was going to build a gorgeous new
theatre. He was going to embark on musical
comedy and Shakspeare readings. It is all
untrue. For years now Holt has set him-
self the task of offering to the Australian public
clean, wholesome fun, and cheerful, if some-
what obvious, romance. For years more
he intends to continue in that path if the Fates
permit. The present Sydney season closes
before Easter. Bland Holt then goes over to
Melbourne and finishes a season there some time
in November, 1907. Then he and his blithe wife
take a few months’ rest —probably going to Europe
via America, not playing the while, but looking
for good new plays. Early in 1908 Bland Holt
will be back in Australia —probably in Adelaide,
a city that he has not visited for many years, and
the Easter season of 1908 will be spent in Maori-
land. It will be, therefore, probably nearly two
years before Sydney sees a Holt organisation
again after the close of this season.

The policy of garnishing broad comedy
with song and dance is probably one of the
secrets of the Willoughby-Ward success in
Sydney. “ The New Clown ”is repeating “ The
Man from Mexico” boom. Whenever the laugh-
able human yarn, with its well-drawn set of
characters, shows signs of languishing in interest,
Miss Grace Palotta, or Hugh Ward, or Wil-
loughby, or a combination of them, drifts into
bright song or dance, and attention is quickened
again. So the theatre has always a sense of
fulness after dinner; and sometimes after lunch on
a matinee day.
** * *
Wonderland City is still drawing the
Sydney public. N ext week there will be a complete
change of attractions. Chefalo, the reckless, will
loop the death loop, and Signorina Chefalo will
also do something hair-raising. Baker’s Circus
will be on tap at the King’s Theatre. Last
Saturday night there was a magnificent display of
fireworks. In addition Katzenjammer, Topsy-
turvey, and all the rest of the side-shows are in
full blast. But for the man who has found some-
one ideal there is nothing better than the shaded
seats beside the cool fountains in the luminous
darkness.

J. C. Williamson’s mighty earthquake
that swallows up Miss Vaughan and Gaston Mer-
vale and his satanic laugh, can now almost go by
itself; and the banana tree in the foreground
knows by this time the precise moment when it is
expected to break off short and add itself to the
general crash-bang. The Bulletin has a hazy
idea that among the things it mentioned before in
connection with “Parsifal,” at Her Majesty’s
(Sydney), it didn’t give a word to the ballet
in Mervale’s chamber, which apparently occupies
the ground floor, with Hades in the basement ;
so that when the ballet ladies take off a
few plates the flames from below burst
through. The idea that Hell is “a burn-
ing fiery furnace” thus gets dramatic en-
dorsement ; but up to now this writer hasn’t
detected any sulphur fumes. The ladies stream
their garments in the flames that roar up from
the infernal regions when the lids are lifted, and
they are not even scorched —which is no doubt
the dramatic endorsement of the other part of the
material-hell creed, that the “burning fiery fur-
nace ” consumeth not. The trouble is in such
cases that the audience doesn’t always know when
to be serious and when to be frivolous. This is
obviously an occasion to be serious; but, alas !
with hell below and a ballet above, this wicked
generation of play-goers seems to have only eyes
and thoughts for the ballet. Perhaps the terrors
that are roaring in the basement come home to
them after supper.

Some light remarks which The Bulletin
proposed to make about the Walrus and the
Cheshire Cat were unfortunately blown away by
Sunday’s storm. The gale in Sydney blew some-
thing over 65 miles an hour, and the remarks on
Pantomime are only calculated to stand a pressure
of 55 miles. This paper is therefore forced back
into a mere repetition of the words of the advt.—
that “Alice in Wonderland” frivols at Her
Majesty’s at 2 p.m. daily.
The best artists at the Tivoli are now
mostly imitators, though Godfrey and Duncan
are back with their little bit of cockney
humor and pathos, “Me and ’Er.” G. L.
Fletcher adds Dickens and other well-known
novelists to his impersonations; and people are
turning up now for the first part (in a new first-
part setting, from the brush of Alfred Clint, by
the way, and a good one) to catch Claude
Leplastrier’s artistic turn.
** * *
At Sydney Palace Harry Cosgrove Macdona
continues to give sparkle to the comedy of “ The
New Boy.” “The Boy” is having quite a run,
and the people who a few weeks ago were merely
good amateurs are now getting a professional
touch in the quality of their performance.
** * *
At Brennan’s National Amphitheatre
Lieutenant M ‘Donald, who is said to have served
in a scouting corps in the S’African war, does
hair-raising practice with a small-bore rifle. He
shoots at small plaster discs from all manner of
impossible positions. A humorous burlesque is
“ The Pirates of Parramatta,” which winds up
the performance. Also Carden Wilson is giving
imitations of Blandolt, J. B. Atholwood, Cuyler
Hastings, and Tom Nawn.
** * *
At Sydney Royal “ The Path of Thorns,”
with its bright pictures of Sydney life, continues
to prickle with interest and excitement. The
city likes to see what it looks like on the stage.
The pity is that our slums look so picturesque in
the dramatic picture that they don’t plead for the
abolition they have earned.

“Eros ” : Talk about fostering Australian
talent! What sort of a reception did St.
Augustine’s Orphanage Band from Geelong get
when it opened its band-concert season at
the Sydney Town Hall last Saturday night ?
Pretty frosty in the beginning. The back portion
was comfortably filled, but the front and all the
galleries were dotted here and there with stray
• souls, looking like a midget archipelago in a great,
draughty ocean. But great was the surprise
awaiting them. There were 30 youngsters, ranging
from 10 to 16 years of age (the average is 14).
They have won the Boosey Cup and the Sutton
Shield and the band championship for 1906, total-
ling £5OO. They play Wagner, Chopin, Rossini,
Auber, Balfe, Bach, and Von Suppe. Yet I
question if the concert paid expenses.

From the Maoriland Exhibition :
Christch arch is over-run with tennisplayers and military
uniforms. Tournaments, with much cracking- and banging
of guns, fill one end of the Exhibition grounds; the Austra-
lasian Tennis Championship is being bounced for at the
other. Between them Christchurch girl is having the time
of her life. Especially the small girl. All the cadets of
these islands are mustered in one great camp beyant the
Exhibition —in the boundless Hagley Park. These small
youths know the deadly nature of their uniform, and
swagger along with tilted caps, but condescend once in a
while, and in a lordly way, to take the adoring small girl
to ice-cream or Wirths’ circus.
After the Fijian fire-walking ceremony, the Governor
presented each of the performers with a medal and
streamers of gaudy ribbon. But they had to do their
own pinning on. A magnificent savage would stalk
forward with dignity, to be met by a repelling hand at
the end of an arm stretched out its farthest. So far
shalt thou come, it said. The anointing oil certainly was
penetrating.
The “Firewalking” part of the performance was a
breath, a whisper—and was gone. But the frill-frail
before and after and round about was worth some of the
patience and the money of the tantalised spectators.
No one got within 20 or 30 yards of the pit
either during the performance or for half-an-hour
before—not even the much-regarded Governor, nor the
doctors who pleaded for a nearer examination. The
nearest of the near, the creamiest of the cream, were
kept to a circle of chairs 30 yards away. The pit had
been blazing for 11 hours ; and when the largest of the
logs had been taken off, roots were roasted on the stones.
The edge of the pit was strewn with fresh branches of
birch and willow; outside them, a fine stretch of
smooth green lawn. Here began a ballet —a gorgeous
ballet, independent of stage effects of scene and light.
Enter the orchestra, the bright sun making their mag-
nificent brown bodies glisten ; their dress a mat of many-
colored tapia strips. With a soft rustling they sank on
the ground and began a chant —bodies swaying
in unison ; the conch-conch of hollow bamboo
on stones; the clapping of cup-shaped hands. From
the far end of the grounds came the dancers,
softly rustling their dress as they ran. They wore mats
like ballet-skirts, in gorgeous tropical colors. Fuzzy
heads held high; clean-cut muscles rippling under
brown, oiled, satiny skins. Then they danced—all men
of well over 6ft. in height—lightly and gracefully. As
suddenly solemn as before they had been gay, they
flocked round the pit, picking up poles 20ft. in length
and long ropes of tough root. The procession jumped
into wheel-shape, the spokes made of tense root-
rope. Close to the pit, an inner circle of pole-
carriers, jabbing the hot stones in rhythm with
the conch-conch of the orchestra. In the centre
of all, a dancing, yelling creature, his brown face and
body blackened with soot, and dressed out of all human
semblance, busied himself dispersing the devil. All
this noise and movement stopped suddenly, and the 50
ballet men dropped like cats into the heaped green
branches, as from hidden corners came the Firewalkers,
running swiftly, noiselessly, clad in dark-brown cocoa-
nut-fibre mats. Reaching the lawn, they muttered incan-
tations, and ran straight across the pit. All over in a
few seconds. Then the dancers with the gay plumage
once more joined in a wild chant and dance, hiding the
Firewalkers, who threw the green branches into the pit,
and crouched in over them. A confused jumble as the
green branches smoked ; and the whole bevy formed for
graceful block dancing. After this, the spectators
rushed the pit, handled stones, and started explaining to
one another how the thing was done.

Melbourne shows are proceeding in the
same state of unbroken prosperity as before.
They are not too numerous, and they tread not on
one another’s corn. Their Festive Season appears
to be yielding a larger suin total of happiness in
hard cash than any period of Xmas production
for years past. At Her Majesty’s, where
a matinee happens every Wednesday and
Saturday, and the hinges of the sturdy
door have to be repaired after each rush,
the only fault found with the panto, is its
excessive length. “Mother Goose” contains
rather more than the enough which is as good as
a feast. A little of the talk might be cut; the
demon trap business might be shortened, likewise
the variety “turns,” and the antics of the animal
impersonators. Even the clever performance of
the Little Dartos would seem more clever if it
were less prolonged. A saving of from two to
five minutes in about ten different places would
relieve the panto, of half-an hour’s ballast, and
enable it to soar higher in some people’s estimation.
To which the Williamson government may fairly
I reply that the full-and-plenty policy has been an
enormous success thus far. Probably an overfed
public-in-general accepts indigestion with grati-
tude. Talking of the prettiest things in ‘ ‘ Mother
Goose,” last week’s notice forgot to mention Miss
, Ghilhoni’s mellow warblings, and the toe-dancing
: of Miss Addie Hine, and the bright particular
gaiety of 16 ballerinas in red and white costumes.
Here and there among Miss Brenan’s host of
young pupils the damsels are conspicuously chic
and graceful.
“The Village Blacksmith” threatens to
remain at the Royal for another week or two,
whilst his cheeild is getting better, or getting
buried, the fate of that sick infant being one of
the many unravelled mysteries of the Anderson
melodrama. George Cross, in the heroic part, has
lately strengthened his popularity at the expense
of the villain. For the first fortnight of their
wrestling contest the villain was a good sport,
but now he applies the strangle-hold in the second
bout, and has to be stopped by the referee. Next
week he will probably try to choke the time-
keeper for the purpose of getting himself further
hooted by the gallery, but in any case he is bound
to have his neck broken by hero Cross in the
final “go.” If he didn’t die dead on the mat,
there would be no reasonable excuse for Miss
Duggan to rush forward and exclaim “Thank
God ! ”

At the Opera House nothing new was
announced for this week, except the departure
of two or three people, who will leave room for
fresh arrivals. The remaining co. includes Chanti,
King and Benson, Cassie Walmer, The Alaskas,
and Fred Russell; and a dozen other individual
“turns” help to make the programme strong.
*# * *
Seemingly an entertainer’s easiest way of
obtaining a burst of applause from a section of the
audience is to pace up and down the stage, blowing
the bagpipes meanwhile. Scawtish enthusiasm at
these awful moments almost persuades one that
the extraction of a time-honored noise (it is always
the same “ tune”) from the bagpipes is a work of
high musical art, rather than a simple accomplish-
ment of lung-power. It never fails to delight the
Tartan spirit. Chanti plays the “peeps” at
Rickards’ with great success. He makes only the
same old “hurdy-gurdy” sounds that all the
other fellows have made, and in his march across
the stage lacks the Caledonian roll which marked
Chirgwin's burlesque of the braw piper, but it
amounts to a grand performance in the eyes and
ears of the Mactavishes present. Given a mon
in a kilt armed with a bladder of wind, and the
Mactavishes are happy—simply and innocently
happy. For purposes of harmless patriotism
every nation should have a distinctive instrument
of barbarous music, such as no other nation could
dream of adopting.

Melbourne is going to suffer considerably
from the open-air amusement epidemic this sum-
mer. Last year the only regular open-air shows
were Prince’s Court and an entertainment given
by the “ English Pierrots ” on the St. Kilda
beach; both made money in large lots. This year
is a rather incomplete dream
as yet—reared its colossal self on the esplanade.
Every suburb that has a beach has one, and in
most cases two —St. Kilda has four—variety open-
air shows.

The Kelly Gang dramograph is now being
sheeted every afternoon as well as evening at
Melbourne Athenaeum Hall Kelly seems
to be firmly established as heroine of the murder-
ous narrative, because she declines to purchase
the safety of brother Dan by kissing a policeman,
but audiences in general have no euthusiasm to
spare for the schoolmaster who spoils the Kelly
arrangement for wrecking a railway train. By
the time the railway scene comes on the public
have had their taste for blood so freely whetted
that they rather object to the schoolmaster’s
interference. He prevents a horrible catastrophe,
and thus robs Ned Kelly of a chance to mention
that he merely wrecked the train in self defence.
** * *
A furious musician who vents his feelings
on 20 drums is the latest gratuitous attraction at
“Dreamland,” also a lady who displays her Cali-
fornian beauty in “ living art poses ” is shortly to
be added to the bill at Princes Court. The un-
accountable absence of Circus from Melbourne is
partly atoned for by “ Dick Turpin,” at the
Hippodrome, opposite Her Majesty’s, but in the
matter of indoor concerts, the city has been left
totally unprovided for since Xmas Day. The
nearest approach to a Town Hall concert is the
organ recital, given by Mr. Price, every Saturday
night until further notice —a recital which affords
great satisfaction to a small and scattered audi-
ence.
Your complexion, as well as your temper,
is rendered miserable by a disordered liver. By
taking Chamberlain’s Tablets you can improve

Czerny continues to present old “illu-
sions” in a new way at Adelaide Royal, Mr. and
Mrs. W. L. Paine putting in relief work with
comedietta. Wilton Swift and partner also give
a bright “ sketch” at the Tivoli; but this house
has gone back to the bad old custom of a final
farce, which works up, through a man getting his
face floured, to a final explosion—the house
steadily emptying all the time. Dolores has come
and gone, with the published intention of being
back sometime in 1908. The “Kelly Gang”
biograph politely made way for her for one evening
at the Town Hall. Adelaide likes the Kellys,
but reserves its wildest applause for a henpecked
husband, who drinks himself into a condition of
revolt (apparently the same thing as a revolting
condition), and then empties over her the washtub
at which he had been slaving. The cold holiday
season has been unexpectedly in favor of all in-
door shows.
England’s Chow curse is growing. Just
after the Liverpool protest against the yellow
aliens another batch of 32 arrived at Blackwall
docks from Hong Kong. They were all under
contract to Liverpool laundry-keepers and
grocers. They mostly commenced at ss. per week
and found. The Immigration Board was at latest
considering the matter and feebly muttering
“Dunno.”
Dr. Samuel T. Knaggs, so well-known to
the Sydney and Newcastle public as a doctor,
has written, and Anthony Hordern and Sons have
published, a household medical work—“ Common
Complaints and Simple Remedies”—which should
be of great use in the lonely parts of Australia.
The book does not profess in any way to show
how diseases may be cured without the aid of
a doctor. But it does give simple information
which will help a sufferer over a crisis until medi-
cal aid can be procured; and affords valuable
guidance as to diet and habit of life in various
ailments. There are many useful warnings
sprinkled through the book in regard to the
treatment of the organs of the body ; diet tables
are given for such diseases as diabetes, anaemia,
phthisis and dyspepsia; and full instructions
for cases of poisoning are included. It is alto-
gether a most useful work.
“ N.” : Modern
critics agree that Christ
could not have been
born at Christmas, in
the depth of the Pales-
tine winter, which is
severe. The month of
His birth being un-
known, it was placed
at the convenient season
of the New Year, replac-
ing a universal heathen
festival of the same
period. Wouldamother
have been thrust into a
stable in the depth of
winter? Never. The
time would be more like
midsummer. Nor would
a Roman Emperor have
summoned his subjects
to come from all quar-
ters for taxation in the
depth of winter. Nor
would shepherds have
been keepingtheirflocks
in the fields by night.
Crosby, Labor can-
didate for S.A., is the
winner in the bad-luck
competition over the
Senate election. Early
returns made him a good
third to Symon and
Russell in the S.A.
three. Country figures
brought Yardon well
above him, and Cros-
by’s c h an c e seemed
done ; yet another spurt
from an out-of-the-way
district landed him 14
to the goo d—l 4 in
31,500! After this fort-
night’s suspense, the
new member fell seri-
ously ill, and went into
hospital. Vardon de-
manded a recount, and
for several days gained a vote here only to
lose two there. But in Hindmarsh—a strong
Democratic district—a solid batch of 85 votes,
belonging to Play ford (who was nowhere), had
somehow got credited to Crosby ; and at the mid
of all things he was declared out of it by 34. He
is still dangerously ill.
“Alba ” : Was in a fancy-goods warehouse,
recently, when a consignment of Japanese Xmas
toys was being unpacked. The top rows con-
sisted of toy bettles and pug-nosed kiss-gods that
thrust out impudent red tongues when squeezed.
The second layer ranged from the startlingly in-
decent to the vile. The third and fourth lots
gave writer an insight into the morals of the
Bushido humorist. The most frenzied school of
French decadents are saints in comparison with
the lecherous-minded Japanese toy exporters.
By the time the warehouse packers had arrived at
the bottom layer of unmentionables, my not-too-
virtuous hair stood up in violent protest. there
were tiny brass-lacquered geisha women, the size
of your thumb, and there were metal toy satyrs
whose end and aim was Japanese beastliness, l
asked the boss importer, with assumed inditter-
ence, where he intended to sell such a hell-f)ot ot
Shogun vice and art. He glanced at me with a
scared eye. “We daren’t sell them,” he gasped
“We give them as Christmas presents to to our
friends and customers.” I picked out oneofthe
nicest, and asked him, as a favor, to send « to
Mr. Bruce Smith. I also offered to pa} po.-tage.

Me. William Tyree,
314 George-street,
Sydney.
Sir,
I have read my brother William’s and Ma’s letters in
that dreadful paper, The Bulletin. I don’t think either
of the letters give a full account of what Pa is doing with
the Spray.
You have no doubt heard that measles broke out in our
school last week. Pa immediately went down to the
school and thoroughly disinfected it and whitewashed it
inside and out.
Teacher Johnson told Pa that the fleas were a great
trouble to the children and that it was impossible for him
to get their attention whilst they were scratching them-
selves, so Pa made up some chemical mixture and sprayed
the floor and desks. Now Teacher has written to Sydney
for a Spray so that he can have the school cleaned out
every dav.
Pa used to drive the milking cows to the dip every week
to have them dipped for ticks ; it took nearly all day and
Pa used to come home the worse for drink. Now he
sprays them in the yard once or twice a week and there
is no more trouble on that account.
Part of our ground is covered with prickly pear. Pa
has had a lot of it sprayed with arsenic, and he finds
that it will cost very little to get rid of Prickly Pear in
the future.
Pa has discovered that the insect parasites on vege-
tation can only be killed at certain seasons of the year,
and that if the spraying is not done at the right time it is
of no use, and that that is the reason some of our orchard
was never free of pests ; now that he has a few sprays he
can go through the whole orchard in one day.
Since he bought the first spray he has become quite a
scientist, and he keeps Ma up at night telling her all
about Microbes, Bacteria, Electrons, Atoms, and Oellula
or life, until Ma goes to sleep, and has to be carried off
to bed.
Pa says the day is not far distant when every School,
Dairy, Butter Factory, Creamery, Piggery, Slaughter
Yard, Gaol, Asylum, Ship, Factory, Warehouse,
Vineyard, Orchard, Poultry Yard, Hospital, Aboriginal
Station, Agricultural College, Barrack, Law Court, Rail-
way Station, Farmer, Fruitgrower, Gardener, Post Office,
Doctor, Municipality, Pastoralist, Police Station, Man of
War, Hotel, Vigneron, will be compelled to have a Tyree
Spray, as the more he reads about the subject the more
he sees the importance of fighting the deadly microbe
and insect pests.
Yours truly,
Gwendoline Williams.*
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ The Captain ” : One frets rather sick of seeing on the
variety show-bills, “Direct from the London Halls,”
“ Has created a furore in England and the Continent,”
and so forth. Won’t the public look at Australian
artists? Was in Perth (W.A.) when Alec Laing Cruick-
shank and Pansy Montague La Milo were playing at the
Palace Gardens. They were billed as having come direct
from London and Paris, and had “ created a perfect
furore ” there. Neither of them at that time had, ever
been out of Australia. They had only just come from
Melbourne, after commencing with Kickards.
“Micawber”: “L.E.” asks (B. 27/12/’O6) “Why does
not somebody go upon the stage and give a few doses of
‘ Aboriginalities ’ ? It would be a fresh line of business, and
bound to catch on.” In answer, let me state that for the
past two years my semi-professional calling (raconteur,
singer, and dancer) has been eminently successful during
my country trips, thanks to a liberal fund of Abo. yarns
at my disposal. Again, I may mention that two of
George Fuller Golden’s famous “ hits ” were bodily lifted
from The Bulletin. Given a man who knows how to
tell an Australian story, The Bulletin will from week to
week supply him with enough humorous matter to keep
him up-to-date in his business. Of course, it is scarcely
fair to use this without acknowledgment, but who can
refuse a good thing when he sees it ?
The success in the Cold Country of Pansy Montague
(Milo) has lifted the name of Australia in the variety
business. Result: Australia is finding many new chil-
dren. One of the latest to affix the tag “ Australian ” to
his turn is J. W. Winton, ventriloquist. Twelve years
ago Harry Rickards imported Winton from England, and
considering that his experience was gained in Australia,
there is a certain amount of justification in his claim.
Winton is going well in London and the provinces,
and an advertisement describes him as “ the greatest
exponent of modern ventriloquial art, and the most suc-
cessful Australian turn extant.” Meanwhile in Australia
home-grown talent still masquerades as “straight from
London.”
The proudest, coldest man on the Australian stage
just now is Chanti, the variety person with a bundle of
stage devices made in Germany, who is figuring at
Melb. Opera House. Chanti is a young man with 19
pairs of trousers and a Kaiser dialect, who dashes behind
a curtain, .yanks off his trousers, pulls a string that
changes his scenery, and suddenly reappears as some-
thing quite different to what he was before. He can
dance a bit, but otherwise he is merely an agitated
German, changing his trousers in a violent hurry'.
What the “ artist ” does when he has torn off one set of
clothes, and revealed another set, is a matter of indiffer-
ence apparently. Certainly what Chanti does is very
dull stuff, even when he sticks a card-board bull in his
Spanish impersonation. But Chanti’s pride in his little
mechanical devices is wonderful to see, and every' time he
changes a picture-frame into a chair, it suggests that
Providence made a mistake in bestowing the gift of crow-
ng Upon a mere fowl.
Touching the insolvency of Herold Bassett, and his
allegation that it was due to the mismanagement of his
manager, W. J. Lincoln —the manager referred to—
objects to being made the scapegoat. Lincoln, who is
just now conducting a Tasmanian tour for Leslie Harris,
writes :—“ I did not join Mr. Bassett’s management with
any active interest until the close of the first Melbourne
season, although he asked me as a favor to assist him
during the week following his optening performance.
Prior to my joining him, Bassett had ordered, in hisextra-
vagant moods, the bulk of the printing, &c., and had
formed the scheme of running his show. . . As soon as I
discovered the extent of his orders, I immediately, where
it was possible, reduced much of the printing, &c., within
limits suitable to local requirements throughout Aus-
tralia. However, Mr. Bassett, in the most wilful spirit,
ignored most of the arrangements I had made in his in-
terests, and went his own sweet, reckless way'. I begged
of him to constitute the show as merely a concert party
without orchestra, and I planned for him a quick moving
tour of Australia. This scheme was not ambitious enough,
and disaster followed, as I had predicted. Twelve re-
citals in ten weeks was the ‘ Blanche Arral ’ record
during my connection with the show. It was sheer mad-
ness ! Good money was taken, and just frittered away to
suit the vagaries of Madame and Herold Bassett.”
“E.”: Miss Dolly Castles, having completed a two- .
years’ engagement with the Williamson firm, is returning
to London this week “ to place herself under the manage-
ment of one of the most distinguished of London
entrepreneurs,” it is said. Of the two lucky Castles
sisters, Dolly has been the luckier. Amy was the heroine
of an unreasonable “boom ” on the strength of her alleged
possibilities as a “dramatic soprano” of the grandest
operatic calibre. The boom started eight years ago, but
the brilliant operatic career of the original Miss Castles is
still as visionary as of yore. Nevertheless, the much-
advertised Voice, after a long course of expensive tuition
w'hich would have sufficed to give a high market
value to many another Australian soprano, is a very pretty
voice, and commands good engagements on the concert
platform in Britain. In the case of Amy Castles there
was an exaggeration of the truth, but the solidity of the
truth has been proved. Mrs. Doubleday did discover a
voice out of the common. On the other hand, the ex-
portation and subsequent importation of Miss Dolly, by
J. C. W., was due, not to her voice, but to the notoriety
of her name, created by her sister. She sings w'ith no
particular sw'eetness nor feeling, and her intonation even
is faulty sometimes. She hasn’t any special ability for
comic opera work. Her acting, as compared with that of
the equally inexperienced Miss Aggie Thorne, was rather
poor. But she had the luck to get tw'o years of first class
experience as a prima-donna in Gilbert-Sullivan operas,
which ought to be w'orth a lot more to the young
beginner than the substantial salary paid her for receiving
instruction.
“Edyson”: I witnessed the manifestations of an elo-
quent trait in woman nature, on the sands at St. Kilda,
on New Year’s Day. There was a set of swing-boats in
full blast, and in each boat was a brace of enthusiasts
making holiday by toiling like niggers to jerk their boat
a little higher than the others. Both sexes and all ages
were represented among the swingers, and the end boat
nearest my pitch was occupied by two matrons of the
second grade. They were fat, fair, and approaching
50, and w'ere hauling desperately on the ropes to “ make
her bump ’’—that is, to reach the limit where the iron rods
on which the boat is suspended strike the corners of the
cross beam. Their weight helped in the race, and it v'as
looking as though fat and fifty would win the cracknels,
when an infuriated man, diluted with beer, charged
through the crowd, and howled at one of the stout
matrons. “Come outer that, yeh ole fool!” he said,
shaking a toiler’s fist like a hoof. “Go ter bed ! ” replied
the lady, tugging at her rope, and surging magnificently.
“If yeh don’come out, I’ll damsoon tip yeh out! ” snorted
the outraged husband. “ Yorter be ’shamed makin’ sich a
bloomin’ exhibition iv yerself afore all these people.”
“I’ll come out when I’m ready, not afore,” answered the
lady. “ Yeh will, will yeh ? ” snorted hubby desperately.
“ We’ll see all about that, me lady.” He made a dash at
the boat, and tried to grip it. His revolting wife threw
all her weight on the rope, and whooped it up. Again,
hubby made his dash, but this time the boat caught him
fair in the brisket, and drove him head over tip along the
dust for a distance of about thirty feet. The man was
all out. The boat was stopped, and his now tearful wife
dashed to his assistance, wailing miserably. For a
moment she blubbered and appealed over the stricken
wretch, and then, turning, she made a furious dash at the
other fat female who had been her companion in the
swing-boat, and who hitherto had maintained a masterly'
silence, downed her, kicked her, cuffed her, scratched
her, tore her hair and her hat, and then, with a final
kick, squealed : “ There, you beast, that’ll teach you to
go assaultin’ other peoples’ ’usbands ! ”
A lesson on stage illusion. Irving wan ted cloth of gold
for his production of Henry' VIII. He, Stoker, and Love-
day' sat in the stalls of the Lyceum one mornin _ to judge
on five samples laid over chairs on the stage. No. 1 they'
rejected with contumely, and were unanimous for No. 5.
Yet No. 1 was real cloth of gold at an enormous price,
while No. 5 was lacquered canvas sheeting prepared in
the property room.

Two of the most dazzling members of the Royal Comic
Opera Co., when on its way to Maorilan'd, made very
elaborate preparations for the first night at dinner on
shipboard. The effect was charming, but, alas, the result
of the prolonged toilet was that the charmers didn’t
arrive at table until the first sitting was over, thus wast-
ing the generous display of white shoulders and diamonds,
and placing themselves in the second dinner contingent
for the rest of the voyage.
“ Ned Kelly,” dished up as a “ great Australian drama,”
has at last reached England. Sam Ellish, an actor of
repute, is presenting a condensed version of the gent in
the kerosene-tin armor at the various music halls. Sup-

going well.
A striking addition to Melbourne pantomime chorus is
Edie Stach, sister of Leo Stach, already known as a pro-

several championships of recent years. She is also one of
the few female swimmers who dare high-diving feats.
Little Judkins appears to be advocating

Things happened in Mildura (Vic,) oil
New Year’s Day, and kept on happening the day
after. Late in 1906, the fruit town got its first
colonial wine license. Mildura has ho pubs, only
clubs and private cupboards, and when the place
with the wine-license started business on New
Year’s Day, the district galloped joyously to get
drunk in this new environment. On New Year’s
night the Mildura sidewalks were too narrow for
the average Mildura citizen. He found it hard
to march up the street arm-in-arm with himself,
and get between the buildings without touching.
And by 5 p.m. on January 2 the police had nine
men gazing with dull eyes at the inside of the
lock-up walls—more drunks than faced the court
during the whole of 1906. Mildura is still drinking
sodawater to take the taste of its record drunk
away. (It was only the novelty of the wine ;
please don’t imagine that Mildura never before
learned how to drink.)
When you wake up in the morning with a
bad taste in your mouth you may know that you
need a dose of Chamberlain’s Tablets ; for they

“Bivalve” writes from N.W. Australia:
The statements about the pearling industry in B.
29/3/’O6 are, in many particulars, wide of the mark. The
Inspector of Fisheries estimates the quantity of shell ex-
ported at something over 1300 tons for the year, and
pearls discovered at £50,000. The latter is a very liberal
estimate. There are certainly twice as many whites
directly connected with the industry as the number (245)
given, and it was further stated that all the State got out
of the industry was £490 —‘ ‘ licenses and permits.” But
no mention was made of water and light dues amounting
to about £9BO, paid to the State annuallj r by the pearlers.
Add this to the £490 and you get £1470 in direct
taxation. Mr. Gale never mentions in his annual
report that the pearler has to pay water and light
dues, and no credit is given to us pearlers for
the amount we contribute through the Customs
House. At Broome alone we pay £20,000 per annum ;
also a large quantity of dutiable goods come through
Fremantle for us. A Broome man, who is in a position
to know, estimates the amount paid per annum at the
latter port at £25,000, so it is evident that the much-
abused pearler contributes at least £50,000 per year
through the Customs. With regard to the lights pro-
vided on this part of the coast, they would have been
required in any case for the steam coastal traffic. There-
fore the pearler is really paying for lights he never asked
for or required.
As to the planting of M.O.P. shell from the North-West
at Sharks Bay, the experiment has been an absolute
failure. If, as Mr. Gale states, it has been successful,
why does he not compel the exporter to supply returns
giving quantity of Sharks Bay shell and North-West ditto
shipped from Sharks Bay per annum ?
In my opinion, the only way to prolong the life of the
industry is to close certain portions of the existing
grounds for three or four years, and to enforce the rule
obtaining at Thursday Island whereby a diver is liable to
a heavy fine for*bringing up shell under five inches wide.
Last year a London man largely interested in the
pearling industry assured me that the London people
were making huge profits out of shell. Well, speaking
as an old pearler, I can say that the pearlers are not
making 2 per cent, on their outlay, and have to remain
at the game because no one wants to buy a bad business.
I feel certain, however, that the industry could be made
a very valuable one for Australia if the Federal Govern-
ment would assist by establishing a Manufacturing
Department wherever convenient, and buying all the
shell obtained in Australian waters at, say, £2OO or £225
per ton—protecting themselves against the foreigner by
a prohibitive tariff. Then the Government could enforce
the White Australia policy in the pearling industry, as
the price of shell would enable the pearler to pay white
man’s wages. We would then see on this coast about
2000 white men in regular employment, flourish-
ing townships, and busy ports. As to the notion
that we pearlers love our colored brethren, no Aus-
tralian hates half as intensely as we do the
“ colored races,” especially the Jap. Taken on
the whole, they are dishonest, lying, and ungrateful.
As for the proposed bonus system, the amount of money
required to make good the difference in the oost of pro-
duction through the employment of white labor would
make a total that would scare the most extravagant
Treasurer. Take last year’s output of 1300 tons at an
average net return of £ll5 per ton. To make it possible
to pay expenses with white labor a bonus of at least £9O
per ton would be required—a total of £117,000.
By the way, I forgot to mention that, as Australia pro-
duces 90p.c. of the world’s best shell and about 75 p.c.
of the world’s total shell, it is evident that if the State
manufactured its own shell it would practically have a
monopoly of the No. 1 article, and could have a good say
in regulating the price of the balance.

Flight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE winds are loosed from the ocean lair,
The shadows shake to the grim bat's
wings,
A strange, sad whisper is everywhere ;
The night-hawk sweeps and swings.
The wan clouds reel down the sky, and break
To a glimpse of blue round the pallid moon.
The long road twines like a silver snake,
The midnight vapors swoon.
Your red cloak flames by the lily ranks,
Your eyes flash warm to your leaping heart;
Out in the wattle a bridle clanks,
And now it is time to start.
The horses wait in the shadows yon—
And, bravest of girls, ere we mount and go,
Will your heart upbraid when the night is gone ?
Ah, dearest, you love me so !
Your bridegroom snores in a drunken dream,
The red hounds dream at his feet and drowse.
Will some goblin horde, through his slumber,
Stream
A-clatter across his crimson brows,
To cry our flight to his muffled ears,
To his beating brain : “Come out of sleep !
She has turned her face to the tramping years
With one who is strong to keep ! ”
He hath brutish lips and a brutal tongue,
Eyes of desire, and overbold ;
Yet God be kind, for his years are young,
Though his gilded sins are old.
And so, good-bye, good-bye to all—
Heart’s < heart, the midnight has chimed and
fled ;
May his dreams be fair in the long, cold hall,
And the imps guard well his bed !
The lilies waken to hear you go,
And bend in prayer for their light o’ days ;
The rose-red bower is full of woe,
The wan moon guides your ways.
Long brows I love, brave eyes a-shine,
Fine head upreared, with those lips a-shake —
Fate keep my spirit as sure as thine
Whenever the storm clouds break !
The long road shines in the fitful glooms
Beneath the clatter of heaving hoofs ;
The grey lights flicker about the tombs,
And glimmer on cabin roofs.
Click, clash and clatter, dear heart we ride
In the waking wind to a bursting sun.
God keeps us forever so, side by side.
Till the battle of Life is done !
O’er the long white miles with pounding feet,
And an arching neck, and a slapping mane.
The bay steeds swing, and the echoes beat
To the throbbing of love’s glad pain.
Down the still wide world to the sun we race.
And the hoofs flash flame, and the proud heads
reef;
We are hot on the threshold of happier days,
Far out from the gates of Grief.
Far out from the gates of Grief and Care,
From the blinking hounds and their lord we
ride ;
The clouds have gone to the dim nowhere,
And the gale has failed and died.
Its wraith slips up to your brows of snow,
Lifting and laving your curls apart,
So your eyes shine through, and their glory-glow
Deep drowns my watching heart!
Flame-eyed and fretting, the coursers leap,
The lean limbs stretch to the sweeping stride;
So under the stars and a moon asleep,
Loving, and side by side,
Leaning to feel the proud mouths’ chafe
On the foaming bits when the road looms white,
Shoulder to shoulder, and strong, and safe,
We gallop across the night.
You who have riven the world at a blow,
With those eyes awake ’neath a storm of curls
That blesses your shoulders and throat, spun low
When the soft air lifts and swirls—
Full-bosomed and fine in the rush of youth,
With the crescent brows and their splendid
might—
Oh, you are Queen of the Gods, in sooth,
And I am your galloping Knight!
We ride for love, and we ride for the dawn ;
And the watchers of day ’neath the morning
star,
When they hear the throbbing of hoofs long-
drawn
In the deeps where the wet mists are,
Shall open the Gates of Light, and flood
The world with a glory of gold and red,
That up the stairway with singing blood
We may ride to our bridal bed 1
But dreams are dreams, and a phantasy
Is frail as faith in a purging fire,
Or a snowflake melting along the sea,
Or the joy of a fierce desire.
We are maiden and man on a shining track.
Hearsed by the shadows, and riding hard ;
Beneath us the roadway sliding back,
Above us the dome, full-starred.
The music of hoof-thuds clangs and rings,
The white moon sinks in the west, a wreck $
And jealous I am of the curl that flings
Frail kisses against your neck.
My heart’s tide surges to see thy grace,
And beats, thud, thud, to the hoof-beat’s chime.
So may I ride through all my days
With thee to the Aftertime !
Upborne we fly, and the reaching limbs
Leap on and on, and the nostrils flush,
And the darkling distance looms up and swims
Behind in a windy rush.
(She has not spoken this many a mile.
Yet her cheeks are bright, and her love is plain,
As she steadies a lurch with a fearless smile
For the man at her bridle-rein.)
Your bridegroom turns in his drunken sleep,
The red hounds turn on the rugs and moan.
I vow, sweet soul, that his heart will creep
When he finds the love-bird flown.
Has a goblin crept to his beating brain,
Crying the tale of a twain that fled ;
One a wooer who wooed not his bride in vain,
And one in a cloak of red ?
The new wind, murmurs an undersong
In the thicket glooms, and the night-hawlc cries :
Nate smite our brows if our wait be wrong,
And seal in the dust our eyes !
With you, what matter Life, Death, or Fate ?
The stars swirl faint to our lurching stride.
The world is wide, and the way is straight.
So, dear, let us ride, let us ride l
MAORILAND.

There has been an outbreak of fire at the
Lyceum Hall, Sydney, through the fusing of an
electric wire. When the matter was last heard of
this place wasn’t licensed as a theatre, and
couldn’t get a license on account of its dangerous
construction. A mere “hall,” it seems, doesn’t
need to enter into the same guarantees as a theatre
does that its audience won’t be grilled some day.
So, when a building can’t get a license as a theatre,
it can go on as a “ hall.” In this case the bosses
of the “hall” hung out the comforting sign,
“Jesus Saves.” But, all the same, an English
Judge has just been telling a prisoner, who
pleaded that “he trusted in the Lord” to cure
his infant, that the law insists upon a doctor being
called in, in case of illness. Sydney’s new Mayor
ought to do something emphatic.

Victoria, too, has its new Licensing Act;
and Bung, wholesale Bung, is said to be arrang-

But the difficulty about a demijohn is that it has
no respect whatever for the law of supply and
demand. When there is a large demand for
swankey it doesn’t shorten the supply in the least,
so that just when the demand is greatest it is most
likely to run dry suddenly. What the Melbourne
thirst wants is a demijohn that will automatically
yield, say, one pint per hour and no more. No
beer-sinker can be trusted to regulate his own
supply.

that no followers were allowed. Miss Brown was
the circumstance over which Angela Burdett-
Coutts had no control. The companion controlled
the mistress, encouraging her habit of philan-
thrbpical endeavor in order that she might be
further diverted from the marriage question by
having charitable schemes to play with. Years
went on. The young heiress passed into middle-
age, and under the management of Miss Brown,
who always kept her busy, she became apparently
reconciled to “single blessedness.” A wan,
wasted spinster she was—the picture of a weary
widdy rather than a wise virgin—waiting for
death. The death of Miss Brown was what her
secret spirit waited for. Accepting her as a con-
firmed celibate, Queen Victoria persuaded Miss
Burdett-Coutts to take the title of “Baroness” in
her own right.
Some years later Death called for Miss Brown
and set the Baroness free-free to follow her
heart’s desire and get a husband. She was then
a woman of 67, seemingly old for her age. She
promptly set her cap at the young man (he was
under 30) whom she employed as private secre-
tary. The news of their intention to marry as-
tonished everybody except the few who knew of
how the old lady had been held in thrall. The
Queeri begged her loyal subject to maintain “ the
dignity of her sek,” afid “be ttue to herself*” aS
though it were an offence Against nature for a
woman, who had become famous as a Virgifi
millionairess, to abandon her life-long hypocrisy
and admit her eagerness for matrimony. The
Baroness was true to herself in spite of the
Queen’s august admonitions and in the face of the
world’s ridicule. She married young Ashmead
Bartlett. The fondness she had formerly lavished
upon charitable objects was transferred in a great
measure to her husband. She found him a more
interesting object than any that had previously
worried her, and in her new possession she was
happy. The 67-year-old bride put on an air of
juvenility. She reverted to horseback exercise,
mounting her tame charger in a long skirt—not
in a riding habit. And she outlived the scandal
of her “foolishness,” until rumor, of recent years,
credited her with having linked herself to Ash-
mead Bartlett in a purely maternal spirit, where-
as her intentions were strictly connubial. She
enjoyed 26 years of married life, to compensate
her for the long martyrdom imposed upon her by
tyrannical Miss Brown ; and she must have been
the only woman in the world who has died at the
age of 93, leaving her first love to mourn her loss.

Some N.S.W. Judges, who periodically
denounce the practice of perjury in the courts,
have ideas of their own as to how to put the evil
down. Judge Docker thinks
plenty of gaol for the guilty
would be an effective cure.
Judge Murray thinks that
improvement would follow a
more intelligent way of ad-
ministering the oath. The
way the words of the oath
are babbled by the official to
the witness destroys, accord-
ing to Judge Murray, the
solemnity of the performance.
Ex-Justice Stephen, when on
the Bench, thought more
Scripture teaching and an
improved brand of religion
would meet the case. Justice
G. B. Simpson is of opinion
that the person delivering
the oath should be dressed
in wig and gown, and be
taught to utter the words
with solemnity and dignity.
“Impress the witness,” the
Judge says, and he thinks
that the way to impress him
is Hair and Clothes.
A Baptist minister in America, it is
announced, is endeavoring to popularise his
church by engaging bellringers, and various other
“ variety” artists, to perform in his pulpit prior
to the delivery of the sermon. In Australia con-
gregations have still to content themselves with
performing fleas to relieve the monotony of the
sermon.
The wisdom of the Victorian Legis-
lature in seeking to exercise some super-
vision over private schools was stressed,
the other day, by the result of the first
examination under the Registration of
Teachers And Schools Act of 1906. The
Act provides that nb pfersbn not engaged
in teaching previous tb the p'assing of
the law shall be allowed to teach in any
School without securing registration after
examination. XU fill 43 Candidates sat
for the exam.—the test being edfifcationfil
qualifications and teaching skill. Only
four qualified for registration as primary
teachers ; one as secondary teacher ; and
eleven others were allowed to go on
teaching, providing they came up again
for examination after a little while.

“BiK.t.’* : Many “BV pars imply
fraud ill the pill testimonial. With two
years at the gable, .1 claim to know more
of the “inwatds” Of a multitude of
Australians thaii arty man
liviiig. Part of tile pill-

tribution of booklets in

heard of, listed, atid d
reporter turned on to’
sort them out. Picking
out the best, he puts,
statement in shape ;
patient signs. No con-
sideration given, nor is
there wilful fraud. I
have written 500 genuine
testimonials for one pro-
prietary medicine, and
incidentally could have '
written scores for others
if I had been in their
employ. The frequent
fraud in the testimonial lies in
the patient’s honest ignorance of
his complaint. A disordered
liver may give heart, kidney, and
nerve symptoms, causing the
patient to think those organs diseased.
Careless or ignorant doctors frequently
endorse the opinion, so that when, later,
a liver tonic or pill puts all straight, it
is credited with the cure of heart, nervous,
or Bright’s disease. It cannot be too well
known that any stimulating tonic or pill is
poison for true kidney disease, and little
better for heart trouble, unless under skilled
direction. The sluggish Australian liver is the
parent of the quack’s fortune; sedentary persons
the chief victims. New at the testimonial biz, I
was astounded at the freedom with which maids
and matrons detailed to a casual stranger the
secrets of their interiors. I got to wearing a per-
petual blush—honor bright, it was not drink.
The Australian public has a right to an
official explanation regarding the disease which
prostrated Rabbit-Exterminator Danysz at
Broughton Island. At first it was put down to
mushrooms. Then Dr. Danysz said it was the
water. Nowthe water hasbeen analysed, and found
not guilty. What was the cause of the illness ? A
section of the public suspects that it was a case
of escaped germs—the germs that were to kill the
rabbits without injuring a hair or feather of any-
thing else in Australia. A definite official
announcement is called for.

Is the row that a gramaphone makes
music ? A way-out N.S. Wales police magistrate
found the problem on his court menu the other
day, and promptly passed to the next item, like a
wise waybaek P.M. The tinned stuff was being
opened up on the local licensed premises, and as
Bung hadn’t got a music permit, the constable
told him to stop it. As he wouldn’t stop it, there
was a summons for allowing unlawful music at
the Diggers’ Delight. The question whether the
machine is a musical instrument (any more than
the clock that says “Cuckoo”) was just being
raised, when Bung mentioned that the people in
the room were there by invitation, and that no-
body else had a right to be there ; and the P.M.
jumped at that chance to avoid settling the
status of the machine by deciding that the noise,
music or no music, was, anyhow, being made in
what was a private part of the premises.

From the directions enclosed with a
Japanese menthol cone sold in Sydney:—
Fourthly. It will cure every temporary disease of eyes,
when merely smeared around them.
Lastly. An instant cure of loathing, convulsion, dizzi-
ness or vertigo, sea sickness, and the like, is due to noth-
ing but a simple swallowing of one-fifteenth of a single
ball.
There should be a law to stop that sort of ignorant
and lying prescription. Menthol is ngt a cure for
eye troubles, and to swallow one-fifteenth of a
cone might prove in many cases a lethal dose.
One chemist takes the precaution of removing
the Japanese card of directions: he objects to
being mixed up in manslaughter cases. But are
all chemists as careful ?

Confronted with the terrific Dust Fiend,
the City Fathers of Melbourne commissioned
their expensive engineer, Mr. Mountain, to
inquire abroad. Mr. Mountain returns after
eight months with a mouse. He has made the
unique and startling discovery that the climatic
conditions of London and Melbourne are dis-
similar. Four or five years ago the same wise
City Fathers sent their Town Clerk around the
world to gather up-to-date information on civic
matters in general. Mr. Clayton’s report has not
yet materialised, but great efforts, it is said, will
be made to launch it simultaneously with Mr.
Mountain’s report on the dust nuisance in the
City of Mud, and the museum authorities have
reserved a place for these documents contiguous
to the writings of Tothmes of Egypt.

U.S.A. :
I dare say you have heard before now of the trouble
about Jap children in Oalifornian schools. I have two
children attending the Public school, both girls, ages IS
and 11 respectively (the sexes are all mixed in the Public
schools here). Some of these Chinese cr Jap “ children ”
attending the same school are in age anywhere from 17
to 23 years old. And all these “children” are of the
male sex. In the same class with one of my daughters
is a Jap “ child ” of 23 years, also a Chinese boy “ child ”
of 18 years.

Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, was enor-
mously delighted on New Year’s Eve by a large,
florid Scot who had been laying in supplies for the
national festival, the midnight Hogmanay. Ap-
parently he had taken the whisky for a large
circle of friends internally for convenience of
transit, and, while making for his train, suddenly
recollected that a lobster was part of the make-up.
He went into a fish-shop and purchased a lobster,
stayed for 20 minutes to gravely expound the
political situation to the shopman, and then
made a fresh start, with the lobster under
his arm. Ten paces away the lobster worked
through its paper wrapper and fell, but the
string of the parcel remained attached to the
crustacean, and the spirited Scot towed
the shell-fish after him along the path.
Some youths got on to the show, and made a pro-
cession of it. Their howls of derision and delight
brought more spectators, and the splendid Cale-
donian headed an enraptured regiment, as he
grandly dragged a boiled lobster on a string.
Presently the Scot wha hae conceived a dim idea
that something unusual was happening. He
glanced back and discovered the lobster. He turned
and looked down on it, puzzled, but with dark
suspicion. He resumed his journey. The lobster
followed. Again the Scotchman became aware
of the attentions of the extraordinary fish, and
swung round once more. He shook his forefinger
ominously. “ Gang awa’,” he said ; “ gang awa’ !
I dinna ken wha ye are, and I dinna care ; but I’ll
po be followed by th’likes. ” He went on. The lob-
ster jumped and capered after him. Fear came
into the face of the big Caledonian. He looked
back with grim anxiety. He hastened his steps,
but could not shake off the awful lobster. Terror
then possessed the man; he uttered a weird Scottish
cry, and started to run ; but the lobster still pur-
sued him, and two minutes later a policeman
captured a half-mad native o’ Glaskee careering
wildly up Flinders-street, followed by a vociferous
rabble. The man’s eyes were full of horror, and
he was towing behind him the claw of a giant
lobster.

“ F.H.R.” raises a faint blush :
While passing through Miller’s Point (Sydney) lately I
saw a big wharf-laborer being furiously slated by his
small, thin, acid-drop of a wife. A crowd of onlookers
enjoyed the fun. Presently he took her firmly, but not
roughly, by the shoulders, placed her inside the house,
and pulled the door to. Before he could proceed ten
yards she was out at him again. She was a born orator.
Between breaths he asked her, for the sake of Heaven, to
go inside and stop making a circus of herself. Then she
waltzed up to him and smote him on the face with vigor.
There was a whirl of limbs and strange garments before
my eyes, and then. Mrs. Bouser was balanced over her
husband’s knee in a position which allowed her a full view
of the pavement, while with resounding slaps, which
mingled with the roars of the onlookers, he chastised her
in the old effective way of childhood. Then once more
he placed her inside their happy home and closed the
door. This time she stayed there. , If a man can’t hit a
woman he can at least smack her.
HER MARK.
“ Oh, I should just love a sailor husband , You
&ee, he would be away from home so much.”
Memory of Bananaland’s greatest Christ-
mas horror, known as the Gatton murders, was
stirred to recollection last Christmas by the
discovery of an old revolver, wrapped in rags, in
a hollow log near Tent Hill. Inquiries showed
that the tree was cut down a few months
after the crime, and part of the trunk
used for posts, but the remainder lay
in the paddock till lately, when it was cut up for
firewood. Two bullets were traced in connection
with the tragedy, and from this revolver two
cartridges had been discharged out of a full
chamber. The police, however, doubt that the
bullets found in one of the victims, and in the
horse, were fired from this revolver ; yet there is
some significance in the fact that no one has come
forward to claim the weapon.

There were some surprising casualties in
Victoria during the holidays. A girl of 17 stood
on a heap of road metal at Brighton to watch a
passing electric tram. She slipped on the loose
stones and lost a foot. A small boy of four
strolled into an empty house at Echuca and lit a
paper bonfire on the front room floor. A man who
was badly scorched getting him out found the
infant calmly sitting in a. corner surveying the
destruction and helping it by striking matches
and tossing them around. A Carlton house-father
gave his wife a dose of iodine in mistake for
cascara, and, when questioned, took a dose
himself to find out if he really had
blundered. They occupy beds in the same
hospital. An obstreperous horse lashed out
at Richmond and caught two men, one with each
hoof, breaking the “other” leg of each. A Carlton
man essayed to pull straight the arm of another
who had, so he said, put his shoulder out, but fell
and broke his own leg. A man, sinking a bore
near Footscray cemetery, drank copiously of the
water. He is in the cemetery himself now. A
youngster of nine, who saw his little mate, of
seven, run down a slope leading to the Yarra and
stumble in, calmly strolled away —though men
were working close at hand—and disremembered
the whole circumstance till it was pumped out of
him two days later. Truly, there are some
amazing people living—and dead.

On Dec. 14th a Richmond (Vic.) citizen
wrote to the Age, forecasting the weather for the
ensuing 14 days—with absolute correctness, as it
proved. He based his prophecy on the opposition
of Jupiter to Uranus and the subsequent con-
junction of Mars and Saturn. This is the system
that Zadkiel, £. £. Smith and other “prophets”
have employed. In this instance it was more
prescient and reliable than Barracchi’s.

Quietly and unostentatiously most of the
Melbourne suburban councils have of late pro-
vided open-air concerts or simple band
performances in the various gardens
under their control. And since the
City Council first removed the railings
from a city reserve, most of the other
public lands have been similarly
treated. To those who remember the
parks and gardens 10 years ago, with
fences and barricades everywhere, and
but one lawn on which a tired man
might rest or a happy child play, the
improvement is wonderful. As for the
masses of flowers along St. Kilda Road
and the Yarra Drive, they are within
easy reach, yet nobody seems to loot
them. The day may yet come when,
as in a few of the Western American
townships, no private house-owner
will need put a fence round liis front
garden.

Captain Neitenstein, N.S.W.
Comptroller of Prisons, has enlarged
the libraries, diversified the hooks, and
increased the hours for reading in the
gaols, since he took charge. Now, it
is said, he encourages literary compo-
sition, and proposes to establish de-
bating societies for long-sentence men.
When he bossed the Sohraon training
ship the captain started some such
school for his charges, and on one
occasion exhibited before a vice-regal
visiting crowd what he called “A
Travesty of Parliamentary Proceed-
ings.” It greatly amused the visitors,
and as Parliament hadn’t time to give
a travesty of his proceedings, the
matter remained at that. Parliament
didn’t even retaliate by giving a tra-
vesty of the captain’s salary.

Thwaites, Engineer-in-chief of the Melb.
Metropolitan Board of Works, grows enthusi-
astic over the River Yarra. It isn’t to him a
smellful drain, to be derided by the Sydney
scoffers, who happen to have yarded a chunk of
the Pacific Ocean into a chain of gullies and
called it a harbor. It never, he points out,
in summer runs so near dry as the Goul-
burn, which fills the huge Waranga basin,
and will soon irrigate an area as big as the
Roman Republic was when Spurius Somebody
gave Judkins-talk to the Tarentine mud-slingers.
The Yarra could supply water, without storage
(mark that), for 2,000,000 people, and you wouldn’t
know it had done it. With storage, it could
supply a city like London. Above Dight’s falls
(a little three-foot slide in the stream at Colling-
wood) there are fewer bacteria to the cubic inch
than in the Thames at the point from which
London’s water supply comes. If somebody will
give him £300,000, Thwaites will build a
40ft. dam at Dight’s falls, instal an electric
plant, and generate and distribute nearly
as much power as the Melbourne City Council
and the Sydney tramways plant put together.
Also, he’ll make you a glorious lake, going six or
eight miles back. What’s more, he’ll build locks
leading from the lower river to the lake, and the
locks will lift 130-ton barges 80ft. long, and 4ft.

Chamberlain’s Tablets strengthen and in-
vigorate the stomach; and many people have
found that after using them they could eat food
that previously disagreed with them.*
A little girl of ten was last week admitted
to a Vic. hospital severely burned while
cooking for the family which engaged her as a
servant. There should be some provision in the
Factories Act to prevent children from doing
such work. To those unaccustomed to it, ordi-
nary household cooking is as hazardous an occupa-
tion as firing shots in a mine, and far more
laborious. Small kiddies should not be permitted
to fool round with heavy vessels full of liquids, any
more than they should be permitted to monkey
with live wires in an electrical station.

For what object do agricultural societies
really exist ? They are supposed to be designed
to improve farming and the breeding of stock.
But how does that awful country-show abomina-
tion, the “worst turn-out ” competition, tend in
that direction? It is generally an event which might
well come within the purview of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The
staggering remnant of what was once a horse is
“ harnessed ” by means of twine, rope, pieces of
rag, and scraps of hoop-iron to a couple of sap-
lings to which is attached an axle with an odd
pair of wheels, supporting a packing-case holding
the driver. The Bulletin only remembers one
satisfactory event of this description—when the
owner of the “ worst turn-out,” driving it home,
found the animal part of it dead on his hands in
the main street of the township. It cost him
more than the amount of the prize to have the
corpse removed and burnt. If he had fallen down
nearly dead himself, there would have been no
great reason for grief.

TT7 r H EN Jock M‘Nulty came to town
A/X/ His Other _ Self said with a smile:
f f “ For long, Jock, have ye kept me
down.
Let’s have a gay time once a while.
Don’t he afraid,” said Other Self;
“ You are a stranger in this place,
And so you can enjoy yourself,
No one will recognise your face.”
For twenty-three years Jock so grim
Kept good before the eyes of men,
Though dreams would often come to him
Of pleasures he could fancy then.
Just think, you men who really live,
Of twenty-three years’ yearning for
The pleasures that great cities give,
And pity Jock ! Can I say more ?
So, arm in arm, in search of life
Jock and his Other Self went forth,
Adrift amid the city’s strife,
And snapped their fingers at “ the Wrath.”
But ere he tasted Circe’s cup
A thought shot through him , like a flash,
That he must put the money up,
For pleasures always run to cash.
“ Ah-h Vice is an expensive thing;
It costs so—much ” —he reasoned thus,
And so he didn’t have his fling—
’Twas cheaper to he virtuous!
And in his church he thumps his breast—
Jock’s piety is sweet to see —

But the figures for N.S. Wales call for explanation. The
State Parliament lately passed a Local Government Bill,
which came into force on January Ist, though the new
rating provisions are hung up awaiting a proclamation.
In order that the State and municipal taxation should
not conflict or overlap, the State land tax was, for last
year, got in a month earlier than usual; and that made a
difference Of £295,000. That amount must, therefore, be
struck Off the 1906 revenue to get a fair comparison.
JivCn then the half-year’s total is £6,268,869. In 1904 it
was only £5,313,366 ; so in two years the July-December
revenue has sprung only a few pounds short of a million.
At least, it is called revenue. Though most of
the States are for the moment in a position in which they
ought to find it comparatively easy to be honest, some of
them still include land-sales money as revenue—which is
just about the same thing as if they sold a section of rail-
way line every year and included the proceeds among
the railway receipts. “ Land revenue ”of N.S. Wales in
the six months was £844,649, or £96,384 more than in the
latter half of 1905—which seems to mean an increase in
the size Of the offence during the past six months. Of
the £844,649, probably about £600,000 represents these
land-sales—the rest is rent. Both Victoria and South
Aus. reckon as revenue a considerable amount of the
same sort of money. Queensland alone, under Labor
Premier Kidston, is now deliberately honest in the mat-
ter, and includes no land-sales money whatever.
Only N.S, Wales, Queensland, and Westralia
furnish monthly expenditure returns. N.S. Wales this
past half-year has spent on revenue account £5,907,468,
or £142,700 more than in the first half of the previous
financial year, and £715,746 on loan account, or £96,031
less. So the total revenue (including land-sales money)
has been £6,563,869 and the total expenditure £6,623,214;
which means that, in spite of the early collection of the
land-tax, the State didn’t pay its way in this six months
by £59,345. And this happens at a time when the State
is amazingly prosperous —when all three great industries,
the pastoral, agricultural and mining, are booming. Even
at such a time N.S. Wales, instead of paying the bill,
passes it on to the children. For all practical purposes
the State has borrowed over £1,200,000 this past half-year ;
for it has sold £500,000 worth of assets (in other words,
it has used up that much of its capital), and it has spent
straight out over £700,000 of loan moneys. Then Trea-
surer Carruthers twitters about his record surplus. The
position now is certainly better than it was ; but it is
only better now because it was infinitely bad before.
In the past 25 years alone approximately £33,365,000
has been got from land sales. The whole of that
money, which ought to have been used either to
pay off debt or to add to permanent works, has been
used to fake the national balance-sheets with. And the
system hasn’t been abandoned yet. In good years like
the present the result of these faked balance-sheets is
reduced railway freights, reduced railway fares, and
onslaughts on to the Treasury generally. But seeing
that the same land can’t be sold twice, the fake must end
some day. Meantime as every sale means less rent to be
received for the future, and less true revenue, the
struggle will grow harder and harder: the time must
come when N.S. Wales will have neither land to sell nor
land to draw rent from.
When the N.S.W. Parliament had an odd
quarter-hour at the end of the session it passed works,
to be paid for out of loans, at the rate of millions a
minute; and scarcely a member thought it even worth
while to gasp. Most of them just went on yawning. So
far as anything was said at all it was that, the State being
now extremely prosperous, it ought to “launch out”—
on I O U’s, mostly. Loan estimates for £1,680,000 were
therefore passed with scarcely a word of debate. And
while N.S.W. is “ launching out”—on I O U’s —because
it is prosperous, Westralia has just decided to “launch
out ” —also on I O U’s —because it isn’t as prosperous as it
thinks it ought to be. The borrowing disease has so
eaten into the marrow of the cowardly Australian State
Parliaments that they make leanness or fatness equally
an excuse for going to the pawnshop, so that they needn’t
have the unpleasantness of cutting down expenses, in-
creasing taxation, or saying “No” to constituents
hungry after local improvements at somebody else’s
expense.
Amidst it all, Bent, of Victoria —blustering,
foolish, vain, old Thomas Bent —stands out conspicuously.
He said that he was going to have a surplus of £4OOO this
year ; and therein he was the same old Bent. He knew
that he would have more, unless something shocking
happened ; it is pretty certain, anyway, that by
March, when nine months of the year will be
through, he will have £500,000 available. With
that, he will wipe out past revenue deficits, now
represented by a loan from the Savings Bank ; and the
Savings Bank will then lend him the same money where-
with to pay off part of the £4,000,000 loan falling due in
London. Probably about £3,000,000 will be raised in
Australia to pay off Bull-Cohen. The big fact, however,
is that, with land sales amounting to about £250,000 a
year, or one-fourth of N.S. Wales’ offence, Bent will re-
duce the debt this financial year by at least half-a-million,
while N.S. Wales will sell its land to the extent of a mil-
lion and add probably a million and a third net to its
debt.

From the investor’s point of view the fly in the
ointment, so far as trustee cos. are concerned, is the
liability on shares. It isn’t an explosive liability like the
uncalled capital in a fire insurance co. ; but it is there,
for all that, and it might be called for in the event, say’
of what the courts might decide had been the improper
investment of trust moneys. Two or three Melbourne
cos., some years ago, tripped over this danger, and hurt
themselves. The big Perpetual, of Sydney, has its shares
paid to only 55., leaving a liability of £9 15s. ; the Per-
petual of Melbourne £5 shares have had only £1 paid up ;
the Sydney Permanent £5 shares are only 2s. 6d. paid.’
This liability means assurance for the man who drops his
will in at that office ; but just as it means assurance to
one lot it means liability to the other. Good-sized profits
are not therefore to be grumbled at.
* * * *
The form of the published accounts of trustee
cos. is not, as a rule, satisfactory. A few of the accounts
are obviously cooked. They hardly even profess to show
the real results of the period with which they are sup-
posed to deal. These cos. have probably made bad in-
vestments, and they show just enough profit to allow of
their dividend ; the balance, if there is one, goes to write
down assets. You cannot tell what the assets are reallv
worth, because all income, whether from commissions or
investments, is lumped together, and no confidence can
be placed in even the lumped figures. The treatment of
the corpus commission is another weak point. Some cos.
take credit for the whole Of it before it is earned,
throwing upon the subsequent annual commission the
duty of providing for future expenses and profits. Occa-
sionally, the annual commission will not cover expenses
on a fair scale. And in any case the system makes for
wildly erratic figures, which are liable to mislead the
incautious investor. Some of these features will be
noticed in the following list (the figures are up to the
dates of the last published balance-sheets)

The Executors (Adelaide) wrote off £l5l out of profits to
cover depreciation of leaseholds.

The last two in the list struck trouble when trouble was
hard to dodge in Melbourne, and appear since then
to have been doing a good deal of cleaning-up
behind the counter. Probably that accounts for
their comparatively low returns still. Apart from those
two, no eo. shows less than 7 per cent, on shareholders'
funds, and the average is well over 12 per cent. It was
admitted a few minutes ago that, in view of the liability,
trustee cos. were entitled to pretty good profits ; but it
is a question whether 12 per cent, isn’t a point or two
beyond “ pretty good.” The trustee cos. (in the absence
of a public trust office) ought to get most of the country’s
trustee and executor work to do ; but they don’t get it
at present rates. The rates have been maintained on
the plea that many trustee cos. had made bad invest-
ments in the boom times. When banks and building
societies made bad investments the shareholders’ capital
was written down ; they didn’t keep fixed deposit rates
at 1£ percent., and overdraft rates at 7J per cent., in
order to work off the dead horse and square things. And
the trustee cos. that haven’t any dead horse to get rid
of are making profits which begin to suggest a revision of
the rates and other charges, which are too high and too
frequent to allow of the public giving the professional
executor as much of its work to do as the skilled pro-
fessional executor ought to have.
Shares in some of the trustee cos. don’t often
reach the market. But where they are quoted they
usually show a substantial advance during the year—
Sydney Perpetual from 11s. to 13s. 3d., Sydney Perman-
ent from 4s. 9d. to ss. 3d., T.E. & A. (Melbourne)—which
will put up its dividend for the half-year just ended—
from 325. to 415., Equity from 21s. to 225. 6d., Union
from 18s. to 19s. Bd., Queensland Trustees from ss. 2d. to
6s. 3d. In the following, list, which covers the stocks
that as a rule come on to the market, the investment re-
turn is calculated upon the dividend paid in the year
covered by the preceding figures :

ment

The Perpetual (Melbourne), which shows the largest
return in the list, was one of those that got into diffi-
culties over investments, and there appears to be still
some doubt whether it has got the book value of its assets
down to bed-rock ; and the big liability on its shares has
the more to be taken into account because it has such
small reserves.

The stocks that Maoriland puts its little bit of
savings in showed very much the same move-up last
year as those of Australia. That is, except the indus-
trials. The woollen cos. in nearly every case struck
market trouble —the same old trouble that they have
been bumping against for many years. Take seven years’
history of the principal woollen co. stocks (list compiled
by Hill Fisher and Son, of Christchurch) :
Kaiapoi. Mosgiel. Wellington.
1900 .. £6 12 6 £4 2 6 £5 10 0
1901 .. 660 400 5 50
1902 .. 650 3 17 6 550
1903 .. 676 410 550
1904 .. 600 3 13 0 4 19 0
1905 .. 5 0 0 2 19 0 3 15 0
1906 .. 500 2 17 0 326
That ought to be sufficient proof of what is happening to
the Maoriland woollen industry, in the absence of ade-
quate Protection and of the regulation of shoddy
imports. Maoriland gas cos., which have natural Pro-
tection against the foreigner, have, on the other hand,
seen their stocks steadily move up in price as population
and profits have increased. Auckland Gas, £l4 at the
end of 1904, stood at £l5 at the close of 1906 ; Christ-
church Gas moved up from £9 10s. to £10; Wellington
from £lB to £l9. Bank, insurance, coal, and financial
stocks show up in much the same way. The only ones
that are going to the wall are the industrial concerns,
run under Maoriland Arbitration Court awards, which
must compete against foreigners who don’t work under
any such conditions. And the country could very much
better afford to see the financial co., which employs a
manager, a 155.-a-week clerk, and a door-mat, go to the
wall, than an industrial co. which employs two or three
hundred men. From that point of view a list showing
the movement of Maoriland stocks makes very melan-
choly reading.

The Freehold Assets .Realisation Co. (Mel-

1906 .. 484,967 211,237 26,068 8,896
According to the foregoing reckoning the situation is
therefore as follows :
Deposits paid off £872,470
Total paid for deposits .. .. 219,252
Depositors’ loss £653,218
The figures for some of the early periods were never
clearly presented, however ; and, according to a recent
official statement, the total amount paid oft is £876,704,
or some £4234 more than is shown above. In any case,
the funeral has been gloomy enough. About two-thirds
of the deposits consisted of foreign money ; and when
year by year some of these depositors get finally rid of
the unfortunate business by accepting about ss. in the
£, there is apt to be an unfriendly feeling towards these
parts. Still there are always the Six Hatters, instead of
the sixty-and-six boomsters, on whom to put the blame
for the unfriendly feeling.
So far as can be made out from what at one
time were fragmentary accounts, the progress of the
realisation of assets has been as follows :
Loss on
Assets Sold During Cash, &c., Property
(Book value). Year. in Hand. Sold.
1896 .. £1,289,163 £27,816
1897 .. 1,116,815 23,225 £64,500
1898 55,592
1899 .. 963,368 23,586 55,756
1900 .. 902,514 £60,854 25,257 43,964
1901 .. 826,678 75,836 24,304 57,351
1902 .. 774,454 52,224 25,566 30,551
1903 .. 662,842 111,612 44,092 82,360
1904 .. 607,534 55,308 44,640 36,702
1905 .. 487,967 119,567 49,191 88,494
1906 .. 451,354 36,613 52,579 23,086
Besides the loss showm on last year’s property sales —
that is, the difference between book values and the
amount realised—£3s63 was written off old advances
discharged during the year. As to income, rents,
interest, etc., amounted in 12 months to £4755. Funds
invested at interest appear to have averaged about
£50,000 ; at 3£ per cent, that would bring in £1750. On
the book value of the property the balance of interest
received (£3005) would show 13s. 3d. per cent. That is
gross. Of course, a very large proportion of the assets
consists of suburban building blocks ; and though some
Melbourne suburbs are getting a few new buildings, there
is no speculative demand for building blocks ; and so the
funeral is very slow.
What is the use of dragging a concern of this
sort on like this? How long must we keep our corpses on
the premises—especially the corpses that we are ashamed
of ? Twelve or fifteen years ago, instead of things of this
sort being buried quick and lively, it was decided to pro-
long the funerals, in the expectation that boom land
values would return. But they show no signs of
return—-absolutely none whatever. Even in this time
of great prosperity, all the printers’ ink spilt over
auctioneers’ adjectives produces hardly a ripple. A man
buys if he wants to build, and that is about all. Mean-
time, the expenses of unnecessary and futile concerns
have to be paid—by the depositors, of course. Such things
ought to be put upon a proper basis. Instead of paying
off a few people with ss. in the £ this year, and another
few with ss. in the £ next year, and so giving an annual
reminder that Australia has been what it oughtn’t to
have been, the businesses should be cleaned up at a time
when Australia can stand the shock. Depositors ought
to be induced to face their loss, and, if they like, take
stock in a new co. with a capital sufficiently small to
allow’ of a return being shown. If they won’t take stock,
then no doubt Australia can raise the money to pay them
off at a fair rate in the £. In that respect they are not
for many years likely to get such good terms as they
could command now.

The reserves now consist of formal reserve £22,114, acci-
dent reserve £1213, and undivided profit £6747. The
principal assets are land, works and plant, £267,783 ;
and whether anything has been written off this
item during the year the accounts don’t disclose.
The profit and loss account, at any rate, shows no depre-
ciation item among the charges. Possibly something is
charged in the unpublished working account. Anyhow’,
shareholders ought to know whether any of the profits
have been appropriated to write down plant; if they
haven’t been, then the cold eye of suspicion may rest
upon a few thousands of the stated profits, because if
depreciation isn’t charged now, it certainly will have to
be charged later on, and on a higher scale'. The co., in
spite of its recent increase of capital (which now
stands at £183,727), still has debts amounting to
£97,270; twelve months ago they were £94,274.
The more prosperous it is, the deeper in debt
this co. seems to get. The increase in spite of
the large profits on hand is due to an increase of
£3516 in plant, etc. ; £5505 in book debts; and £5351
in stocks, etc. Considering the risks of the business the
reserves are small, and, until one know’s what provision
has been made for depreciation, one can’t tell the worth
of even such reserves as there are. Also, one can’t tell
what the real profits are.

Wellington (M.L.) civil servants now have their
co-operative stores—holdings limited to 100 shares;
every shareholder the same voting power ; cash business
only. The first half-year showed a loss of £2BO, but
expenses included many incidentals that will not be
repeated, and trade in the last month was twice as great
as in the first month, so the thing looks like going. In
fact, only bad management could make a failure of it.

goorlie, will go very much higher; but should they ?
The average grade of ore in reserve was given as 31s. per
ton for 241,000 tons, and the November return pans out at
295. Bd., which means an extraction of over 95 per cent.,
w'hile the costs, including home charges, come to 235. Bd.
This leaves a profit of 6s. a ton ; and, even if the new
plant brings up the output to 7000 tons a month, it will
only mean £2lOO, or, say, £25,000 a year on a capital of
£150,000. This means about 11 per cent, on even the
current price of shares ; and when sinking fund is allowed
for, the return is not too good. Of course, costs may be
reduced somewhat, but there is not very much margin
for that.

Burbanks Birthday Gift (W.A.) is following
the example of a lot of other cos. in the B.M. and Co.
stable, and has taken a 12 months’ option on the Middle
Pinnacles, near Broken Hill. Since the Burbanks Birth-
day was let on tribute, in April last, it has produced, on
an average, IOOOoz. to l’2oooz. a month, and has shown a
far higher grade of ore than was won under the co.’s
management. The peculiar thing about it is that the
tributors, nevertheless, did no development, but started
rooting out ore from .the moment they entered on the
tribute.
Mt. Cattlin, Ravensthorpe (W.A.), went off
with enthusiasm, in spite of the Bull press advising Lon-
don investors to have nothing to do with “labor-run
Westraha.” Immediately after flotation the £1 shares
with 10s. paid up, were quoted at 255. This mine has
been strenuously developed since the beginning of the
year, and, according- to manager Klug, who is a reliable
man, has 21,000 tons of ore in sight, worth £7 a ton.
Values, however, depend upon the metal market; and
the future of that, no man knows. Smelting has already
commenced, and the first return should be known before
long.

The co. which trades as Fremantle Smelter
(W.A.) is shortly to start unwatering three or four shows
at Northampton, about 30 miles from Geraldton. Some
20 to 25 years ago a large number of copper and lead
mines were worked in this district, and shafts put down
to 300 ft., but the collapse in the price of metals in 1885
shut them up. The district is likely to be heard from ;
the copper lodes are big and rich—at surface, anyway—
and railway communication is close handy. The Fre-
mantle Smelting Co. owns about 1100 acres freehold, and
has any amount of cash behind it. The co. consists of
the Kaufmann crowd, whose adviser is J. W. Sutherland,
manager of the Golden Horseshoe, as fine a metallurgist
as he is a mine manager, and a product of Australian
schools, too.

Great Fingall Consols, Day Dawn (W.A.),
appears to have suspended operations at the bottom
(13th) level. During the last working fortnight in
December only 4ft. of driving, instead of the usual 30ft.
to 40ft., was done. Still the average width of the reef
was 35in., and the value 40s. per ton. This was rather
better than it had been, and, if it continues, may help
the mine a bit. The diamond drill bore eastwards from
the seventh level has gone out nearly 400 ft., without
finding anything of value.
* * * *
Oroya-Black Range (W.A.), after hesitating a
long time, has finally decided to install a 20 head mill.
Above 175 ft. the lode has been driven on for 1000 ft., and
it is estimated that there are 44,000 tons of ore in sight
worth 725. per ton. The lode is very flat, lying about two
to one down to 175 ft., and then seven to four. Owing to
this it is expected that it will pass out of the property at
from 350 ft. to 450 ft., and will then be in the ground of the
Sandstone Development Co., recently floated in Sydney,
Even should such prove to be the case, the Oroya-Black
Range Co. will have at least 100,000 tons of high-grade
ore to work upon, and possibly a great deal more. But at
present the position is too uncertain for anything but a
gamble.
• * * •
Victory United, Cuddingwara (W.A.), is to
close down its mill, and, on the recommendation of
Manager Merry, some £7OOO is to be spent in sinking and
opening up the 840 ft. level and erecting a new treatment
plant. This will entail probably four sixpenny calls;
and the patience of shareholders has been pretty well
tried already. According to the manager’s figures, each
100 ft. sunk only opens up some 3000 tons of ore, and
there is at present only one virgin level in the mine.
This is putting the best complexion on things, as several
of the levels were worthless, and the mine has been un-
payable for eight years past. As a gambling counter, the
scrip has served a purpose, but as a div. payer its hope is
almost too slight to hang a bunyip on.

Broken Hill output for 1906 :
Quantity. Value.
Silver in concentrates 5,660,6300 z. £506,531
Lead „ „ 118,770 tons 1,396,032
Zinc concentrates 85,848 „ 182,793
Total £2,085,356
That is the local value. The gross value of the metals
would be in excess of this
Silver £BlO,OOO
Lead 2,046,000
Zinc 972,000
Total .. .. £3,828,000
The zinc concentrates are, for export purposes, valued at
about 425. per ton, though they contain from £l2 to £l5
of zinc alone, besides silver and lead. The other £lO to
£l3 represents costs and smelters’ profits ; and nearly all
this is distributed outside Australia. If 425. is a fair
value to put upon zinc concentrates running from 45 to
52 per cent, zinc, the zinc-extraction business hasn’t
made much progress yet; for it takes from four to five
tons of so-called tailings to make one ton of zinc concen-
trates. (During the past four weeks at the Broken Hill
Prop. 15,580 tons tailings gave 3725 tons concentrates, a
concentration of 4J to 1.) Deduct from 425. the cost of
making the concentrate, divide what is left by 4J, and if
the value declared on these concentrates is correct, you
then get the real value of the tailings. If the value of the
zinc concentrates is correctly declared for export pur-
poses, then those cos. that got ss. for their tailings got all
they are worth at present.
* * * *
According to the published figures, there has
been no increase in either the quantity or the value of
Broken Hill zinc concentrates during the year. Here is
the record for five years :
Tons. Value.
1902 .. 1,260 .. £10,625
1903 .. 20,754 .. 86,587
1904 .. 57,602 .. 117,978

1906 .. 88,848 .. 182,793
Eighteen months ago, and especially when the Zinc Cor-
poration blossomed, the public was told that the zinc
problem had been solved. The figures don’t suggest
that anything revolutionary had been found out. As a
matter of fact, the Zinc Corporation is still struggling
along with the old processes, and trying to make up its
mind which shows the best profit—or, with some tailings,
the least loss. The millions talked of are still all moon-
shine. Certainly, with the De Bavay process going at
the north end, this current year ought to show bigger
figures ; but any excited language about zinc is still un-
warranted. In the metallurgy of that metal Broken Hill
is still only groping.
• • • *
As near as it can be got, the value of the
metals turned out from the Broken Hill mines to date is
£55,000,000. It may be more : it is not less. The un-
certainty arises from the system of declaring only the
value of the product at the mines ; that is, the net value
—the gross value, less freight, smelting charges, deduc-
tions for losses, and smelters’ profits. For purposes of
comparison, the total output of N.S.W. coal to date has
been declared of the value of £50,050,000. But of the
£55,000,000 worth of silver, lead, and zinc, some millions
have been unrecoverable ; and many more millions have
gone into the pockets of foreign smelters and their work-
men. The statistics relating to these metals are very
unsatisfactory ; it is probable that the “ declared value ”
is in many cases unreliable. Australia will not know what
it really does produce until it does all its own smelting
and refining.
* * * *
Broken Hill mines and mills employed 8545
men at the end of 1906. In 1900, when lead was booming
before, the number was 7010; from that it fell away to
4850 during the next year, when lead slumped over £5
per ton. Besides the 8545 men in the mines and mills the
Broken Hill Prop, has 1273 at the Pt. Pirie works and a
hundred or two elsewhere, making a total of 4353 work-
men. The South is now, next to the B.H. Prop.,
easily the largest employer of mine labor, having
supplanted the Sulphide Corporation for second place.
Generally speaking, for four men employed underground,
three are employed at surface, irrespective of those at
smelters, coke works, &c., Who number another four. In
other words, every underground worker keeps seven
others employed. And then there’s the zinc smelting not
reckoned in ; but Australia does practically none of that.
And so far as the South,-Block 10, Block 14, and some
others are concerned, Australia doesn’t even get the lead-
smelting to do.
Share value of Broken Hill mines at the
opening of the market the last three yearsl9os,
£4,127,000 ; 1906, £7,402,000 ; 1907, £11,210,000. All very
nice, except for the last man in. * *
The much-battered and abused Broken Hill
Junction is making an effort to pull itself together. The
ore is to be got out of the No. 9 level, which communi-
cates with the main workings at the 775 ft. level by means
of a hauling winze, and the ground Below that will be
tested by a drive from the Junction North. The latter
mine, at its 937 ft., has a body of good ore about 40ft.
wide within 50ft. of the Junction boundary, and ltis almost
certain that this shoot continues into the Junction at the
No. 10 level. If so, the Junction will have ore to stope
out from the 775 ft. down. In extending the 937 ft. drive
into the Junction the idea is for the Junction North to pro-
vide the men and the Junction the air for the drills ; and
whatever ore is broken on the Junction side, the Junction
North will buy. All of which goes to show the Junction,
is handicapped by not being opened up at depth.

The Broken .Hill British, having lost its main
western ore body about 60ft. below the 600 ft. level, is
now staking a good deal on the eastern lode. They have
this lode in the Central (Sulphide Corporation) and also
in Block 13 (of the B.H. Proprietary), and many argue
that it is the true fissure lode of the Barrier. The
British has located something which may be this body
at the 800 ft. level. It was out while pushing out east
ftoih Blackwood shaft, on the south end of the main
workings, and was traced with diamond drills for some
distance north of Howell shaft, and apparently was then
swinging in northward. It would be a fine lode if it
wasn’t so absurdly narrow. That, also, is the fault with
the eastern vein in the Proprietary and the Central.
Block 14, Broken Hill, has been a long time
in cutting a lode at the 600 ft. level, but the face
of the south drive put out in search of it is supposed to
be getting very “warm” now. A good deal is being
made of the new development in the carbonate zone, in-
dicated by the winze put down from the Bend stope
at the 200 ft. level: The lode is said to be 4ft.
wide in the winze. But those carbonate bodies are most
irregular. The average width may turn out to be only a
few inches. The carbonate mined in what is known as
the Bend stope is in some places very rich in silver, but
these patches occur only in the south face.

The way of the Gillies zinc extraction plant on
Block 10 lease, Broken Hill, is hard. Weeks ago a few
hundredweight of picked tailings, warranted not to kick,
were put through, and what the experts term a “ lovely
concentrate ” was obtained. Then something went wrong,
and other things have been going wrong ever since.
A peculiar feature of the trouble was that the slop-
ing radial chutes of the concentrating pans were
so constructed (in theory) that once the floated particle
of zinc was released by its attendant gas bubble, it could
not, by any possibility, fallback anywhere but on a radial
chute, and so it necessarily would have to be carried off
to form the concentrate. But, it seems, the smaller par-
ticles developed an unsuspected contempt for theory and
avoided the imprisoning’ chutes. There have also been
strained relations between various people connected with
the experiments. At latest, H. Lavers, for some time in
charge of Block 14 mill, had assumed the responsibility
of teaching the Gillies child to walk.
Metallurgist Drake, one of the first silver-lead
smelters in Australia, is, after 10 years spent on the Rand,
back in these parts. He goes presently to Broken Hill
to Watch some trials with the new Elmore metal-sepa-
rating process.

The extent of the rush after copper shares in
England can be sized up from the experiences of Great
Cobar. Less than 12 months ago the promoters of that
co. were just about desperate : they couldn’t get Lon-
don to take up all the shares at £5, and they had to
hawk a few remnants in Paris. After flotation, both
shares and debentures slumped, and were on offer at a
discount. Now, shares haye gone to. about £9 10s. If
the co. were in a position to rush out ore to supply the
boom copper market, this would be intelligible ; but it
can’t make a rush. If it could treat more ore, it couldn’t
get it out at present; and sinking a new shaft is a slow
business at best.

The proposal to put up a copper-smelting plant
somewhere near Blayney (N.S.W.) now looks like coming
to something: Bewick-Moreings have got interested in
the matter. N.S. Wales is at present disastrously short
of custom-smelting accommodation for copper ores.
* * * *
N.S. Wales has achieved another dividend-pay-
ing copper mine—the Grafton. The co. was formed in
1904 to take over a couple of leases at Oangai, and subse-
quently, as a second string to its bow, it bought the
Walter Scott gold show. First year the co. sent away
350 tons of ore, which brought in over £4500, and in 1906
about 300 tons realised over £l6 per ton. In that year
the first furnace was built, and another was put up last
year. A good many difficulties were, however, met, and
lately it was decided to install a larger furnace. Hitherto
development and machinery have swamped the profits ;
but as the co. has got ahead of things, and can see an
output of 15 tons a week for some time ahead, the first
dividend will be-paid this month.

Though White Cliffs (N.S.W.) holds its end up
as the world’s biggest opal-producer, “the company’s”
blocks, once thought to hold all the gem that was worth
working, employ only enough men to satisfy the labor
covenants of the leases. A few years back the Govern-
ment was willing to buy out the holders of the leases—
supposed to be a mostly-English co., though very little is
known about it. If half the amount which the co.
wouldn’t take then were offered now, it would be jumped
at. Possibly there is gem-stone at greater depths ; but
no tributor will accept rights over a few square yards of
ground as sufficient recompense for deep-sinking on the
off-chance of striking the tricky stone.

Not often in a contested election for directors

Work has begun at last on Mt. Budgery, which
was about the last of the Budgery litter to get to work.
It is in its favor that it is right away from Budgery. The
work at and around the latter hasn’t so far shown any-
thing which points to permanency ; it is left for 1907 to
prove that there is a payable body of sulphides under-
neath a shallow rich zone.

Keats, of Tolhurst, Cumming and Keats, the
Melbourne brokers, has got J. Bull firmly by the wool
this time. Having smoothed matters over with, the
Chillagoe debenture-holders, and thus paved the way for
the new issue of shares and a further issue of debentures
(and he got better terms, too, than the directors were
prepared to offer in the first place), .he now engineers a
second deal in Mt. Elliotts (Q.). Until a few months ago
there were 60,000 shares in Mt., Elliott, Ltd. Then 20,000
more were issued at 305., of Which the old shareholders
had the right to 6000; the “underwriters” got the
balance. Shares were about 40s. at the time,, so the
underwriting liability didn’t worry them. Now another
40,000 Shares are taken by Keats, at £4 ; present price is
over £5, though at the time the directors at Irvinebank
(N.Q.) accepted the offer it is said the market was
only £4 6s. The £160,000 will be spent on railway and
other works. This time original shareholders didn’t get
a chance to apply for extra shares. Still, the market has
been made by Keats, who seems to have got the co-opera-
tion of Bewick-Moreing ; for that firm’s boosting agencies
have been employed. Mt. Elliott could reach the Govern-
ment rai way line (not yet built) in about 45 * miles; but
there is some extraordinary yarn to the effect that the
Government proposes to make mining cos. that want con-
nection with the railway go into Oloneurry, and that
would mean nearly double the distance for Mt. Elliott.
But that surely can’t be true—a commonsense Govern-
ment like Kidston’s wouldn’t insist upon such.a waste of
capital. The most it may do is to charge through rates,
no matter i! the line is tapped at Oloncurry or 50 miles
nearer seaboard.

“Thus far nations have drawn their weapons
from the earthly armories of Force, unmindful of those
others of Celestial temper from the House of Love. this
quotation from an Ancient is apposite because of Che
flotation in Melbourne of the Celestial Copper ana
Options, No Liability. Can there be any tempered
weapons, any Damascus blades, in the armory of a no-
liability concern ? Blades, of course, we have all heard
of—those of the Corinthian, Tom-and-Jerry type ; those of
Stock Exchange make; and those of the true-cutting, edged
class. The capital of the new concern, whatever it may be,
is £5OOO, in 500 shares of £lO each, of which the vendors
take half of the present issue of 280 shares, the balance
being held in reserve. It might be thought that half
an issue was enough for vendors. But no; besides
getting half the shares, of the £l4OO subscribed £5OO
is to go to the vendors in part payment of purchase
money, representing actual cash out of pocket to secure
options. The money, it thus seems, is to pay for the
options ; presumably the shares are to pay for the wear
and tear on the promoters’ modesty. Happy name, the
Celestial 1 Especially with shares at a premium. The
properties are on Oloncurry—at Duck Creek mostly. The
Mt. Elliott boom has a lot to answer for.

Understood that the Mt. Morgan (Q.) half-
yearly report, to be issued shortly, will contain a revised
statement of ore reserves, showing a remarkable increase
in the figures compared with those presented at the
time the copper works were decided upon. It was on
the new figures that the recent big deal was pushed
through. #
The Ruby P.C., Charters Towers, puts in an
appearance with a threepenny dividend, and declares the
threatened funeral “ off.’’ For most of the past year the
mine has been in a bad way. Six months ago the
treasury contained only £3 9s. 3d. Since then
prospecting work east of the underlay shaft has
disclosed from 4in. to 15in. of rich stone; but it
remains for the 300-ton parcel, to be treated this month,
to prove whether the high average can be maintained.
The make of stone has so far been proved to live for 90ft.
in one level, and 70ft. in another. The manager reports
that stoping has been continued in the various levels.
The co. has £lO9B in hand, and another dividend is
promised.

There is something wrong with the supposed
assay figures from the School Reserve, Charters Towers.
The public understood that the reef was worth 2oz.
6dwt. gold. The first crushing was, however, a duffer.
The second parcel of 74 tons yielded only soz. 3dwt.,
worth £l5 4s. 6d. ; and concentrates brought £lll2s. 9d.
Total, £26 17s. 2d., equal to 7s. 3d. per ton. Apparently
the sands were valueless. Now the public, loaded up
with shares, watches the co. go into recess.

“ M.C.” : Queensland is trying hard to persuade
itself that it has made a good deal with the Chillagoe Co.
over the building of the Etheridge railway. The men
with the money have taken precious good care to safe-
guard their interests by a Government guarantee and_ a
purchase clause operative at the end of 15 years. The
price to be paid by Queensland will be based on net
railway earnings.” It looks fair, doesn’t it ? But those
who know anything about railway depreciation know
that 15 years is a fair life for a lot of material; if 15 years
doesn’t wear everythin# out, it wears the off; and,
as the price is based on net profits, it is dead
against the Chillagoe Co.’s interest to make more
repairs and renewals than it can possibly help. The line
is popular in Queensland, as every other line has been,
and there is this much to be said—it may form a link in
a trunk line from Cairns to Normanton. Queensland is
taking as much responsibility as if it built the line itself;
and in a time bargain of this kind, the London Jew is
certain to score. The line will cost more, not less, than
if it were directly paid for with borrowed money.

Has the end of the boom come? Anyway, the
Dead Finish has arrived on the Sydney Stock Exchange.
The mine which, for a while, has made something, better
than a decent living for private owners, who have worked
it in a very economical way, is now expected to do the
same thing for a co. It may; for it comes along
carrying the blessings of some good North Queens-
landers; but, as plenty of these N.Q. tin cos. will find,
it is one thing to make a living- for an economical North
Queenslander and another thing to keep a co., with all
its frills, going and pay dividends. Certainly, this. co.
has its home at Irvinebank; and the Irvinebank cos.,
with the Vulcan as a pattern, don’t yet wear many frills.
But Mt. Elliott may teach them. ,

One of the mysteries of the “Australian”
market in London lately has been the advance in Queens-
land Exploration shares. There are 200,000 of them, and
the market has been putting an average of £50,000 a
week, on to the value of the,properties.. The co. holds a
few square miles of freehold country at Oloncurry, right
around where the terminus of the railway will most likely
be and so far as the ;co.’s alleged mines are concerned,
not £lO,OOO has been added to their value in the last year.
Yet over a quarter-of-a-million has lately been added to
the co.’s market value, which now stands at nearly
£700,000. Apparently the rise is due to the boom in Mt.
Elliott Oloncurry—to which the attention of the boss
boomsters in London has lately been given. But Elliott
is a mine, capable of an immediate output; while there
isn’t a proved mine in the whole Queens’-nd Exploration
kit. The pick of the properties which are being pros-
pected are supposed to be the Lady leases, at Coreila. -

Stannary Hills (N.Q.) is to push on with much-
needed prospecting. Profit last term showed up better,
mainly because of reduced costs: 22,198 tons were
handled for £1 os. sd. per ton. The ore averaged 2 per
cent, tin oxide ; and the extraction works out at about
1-6 per cent, oxide, or l’l units of metallic tin. , But as
costs were reduced, so was the quality of the ore , both
were influenced by the larger proportion of cheap low-
grade open-cut ore. Thus 15,690 tons of Arbouin open-
cut ore averaged I*lB per cent, oxide, and cost 4s. 3d. per
ton on trucks, as compared wuth 3519 tons from the Ivan-
hoe costing 335. 5d., and 2809 tons from the Kitchener
ore’ costing 13s. Bd. About this Arbouin ore,, the
manager says, “ It is patches, not lodes , and it is not
a case of cut qnd come again with a depleted open cut.
There are 650,000 shares in the co., of which. 191,850 are
held in reserve ; the trouble is to make the earnings and
the reserves of ore a little more proportionate. The
gross profit of 13s. per ton looks all right, but there are a
heap of things to devour it. Increased railway earnings
are a bright spot, but the line is short, and there is the
usual load of debentures. The obvious expedient of
cutting off some of its tail seldom commends itself to a
mining co., although the Day Dawn P.C. (Charters
Towers) recently reduced its shares from 500,000 to
250,000— simple, but effective.

Dalziel’s tin mine (N.Q.) up to Dec. 19 crushed
1024 tons ore for 44 tons first grade black tin concen-
trates and eight tons of seconds. Value of concentrates
is approximately £5OOO, and the return is equal to about
44 units of tin oxide per ton of ore. The first div. is
expected early in the year. The return falls along way
short of the 10 per cent, that was talked of. And, with
cartage difficulties to fight, the co. is certain not to have
rushed out its ore promiscuously. Mine and mill are
only miles apart, and yet the battery has been idle
now and then for want of teams to get stone in. John
Moffat and the Irvinebank people own mines round
Dalziel’s so an additional 10 head of stampers, and
possibly tram lines to feed the battery, may come soon
The position of a big Co. (N.Q. is ond of big cos.) without
a mill of its own is none too satisfactory 7; lor a piemium
is often paid to get ore packed and treated.
There has been talk of sending consulting
manager Allan Gibb to London to “ introduce ” Cannin-
dah (Q.) to the copper-hungry John Bull, but appar-
ently Gibb himself, though satisfied that Canmndah is a
mine, thinks that in a couple or month's, when the mill
and smelter get to regular work, it will be time to talk to
jb. or rather to invite him to listen to the talk of the
smelter. Lately a Wyalong (N. S. W.) mining man, after
going over Cloncurry, had a look in at the southern
mine, and his enthusiastic remarks had as much as any-

Reported that the Queensland Smelting Co.,
said to be on its financial feet again, has an idea of add-
ing a copper refinery to its Aldershot (Q.) works. Good
luck to it 1 But there are difficulties in the way, and the
prospects don’t look too good. Australia needs a copper-
refinery very badly ; it is monstrous that, just for want
of a little "co-operation among copper-producers, this
most profitable part of the business should be all carried
on at foreign works—some in America, the rest in
Europe. The comparatively small producer suffers most;
the big concerns, like Lyell and Morgan, can command
something like fair terms for their metal. Even half the
output from the smaller mines would keep a refinery
going profitably ; hut no co. would be justified in starting
without a supply assured. And it is doubtful if Aider-
shot can command a supply, being out of the way. It
did seem at one time as though the energetic Sulphide
Corporation might tackle the business at Cockle Creek,
which is much better situated ; but it has got its hands
full of silver, lead, and zinc, and appears now to be “off”
copper altogether. If the Mines Departments of N.S.
Wales and Queensland could co-operate to organise a
refinery, it would be the most practical thing they have
ever done for Australian copper-mining.

Five years’ results at Gympie (Q.): —
Stone. Gold.
Tons. Oz. Dividends. Calls.
1902 .. 140,776 140,510 £263,874 £76,500
1903 .. 186,642 176,369 318,858 86,747
1904 .. 209,644 153.516 239,904 70,957

1906 .. 213,967 130,050 177,439 , 60,945
And, to make the figures worse, not much short of half
the gold came out of the foreign-owned Scottish Gympie
(45,9090 z.), whose dividends accounted for £82,500,0f the
total. Take the dividend record of the two big cos.
1904. 1905. , 1906.
Scottish-Gympie .. £53,625 £78,375 £82,600
No. 2S. Gt. Eastern .. 113,400 68,400 37,800
No doubt No. 2 S. Great Eastern’s disappointment is
largely responsible for the neglect of the field and the
difficulty of getting money in for prospecting. Outside
investors, who didn’t know how Gympie worked the
specimen-box, got such a gruelling that theyl et Gympie
provide its own call money ; and Gympie hasn’t too much
to provide. So its outlook continues blue.

The McArthurs, of Glasgow, say that their new
process is going to do for gold-antimony ores what their
McArthur-Forrest cyanide process has done for the
tailings dumps < f Australia. Their certificate to the
Mitchell River (N.Q.) people is that “ the ore yielded
from 93 to over 95 per cent, of its antimony contents,
leaving the gold contents practically intact, and capable
of being as fuLy recovered by the ordinary methods of
cyanidation and chlorination as if dealing with virgin
ore ” Costs, however, are not mentioned ; and it may be
one thing to deal with the ore with the skilled labor of
the Glasgow works and another thing to battle through
with the unskilled casual labor of N.Q. Still, the
McArthurs back their judgment by underwriting 20,000
Mitchell River shares.

John Porter, who found what led to the
Poseidon Rush at Tarnagulla (Vic.), is now tasting law.
Two enterprising 1 persons discovered that the claim was
90 links short of the quarter-mile from any other workings,
required by the Maryborough by-laws, before a pros-
pector is entitled to a 200 ft. x 200 ft. reward claim, so
thev sought before the Warden to have the excess over
an ordinary claim cancelled. The “ workings ” within a
quarter-mile had been abandoned as unprofitable years
before, and lawyers Luke Murphy and Ni Gan, who re-
presented Porter, argued that “ workings meant actual
workings and not defunct holes. But Greene, P.M., the
eccentric decided against the prospector. Greene, P.M.,
has however not to say the last word on the subject.
Ji* *• * *
As a sporting prospector puts it: Before
Warden Greene, at Tarnagulla (Vic.), the Mining
Registrar deposed to registering two claims in the
names of “Blue Speck” and “Poseidon” respectively.
A protest has been entered against Poseidon for taking
too much ground in his stride. #
Woodall and party, who got the large nugget at
the Poseidon rush, were implored by an old miner to take
on his claim, as he could exist there no longer. Three
yards from where he had stopped work, and about 18in.
from the surface, Woodall unearthed his speck. They
gave the old fellow a fiver. #
When the 9600 z. Poseidon nugget was taken to
the Union Bank, the officials, for a while, were stuck for
something to weigh it with—the usual, office scales being
too small. This may result in the coinage of a new
phrase amongst Victorian miners, to break the scales,
i.e., something extra hefty in the way of nuggets.
New Normanby, Ballarat East, is the deepest
show of the field, and has produced gold worth £326,627.
This is non a bad total, when it is considered that the
capital contributed was only £18,200. Divs paid aggre-
irate £24,000, so that shareholders have had more than
their money back. The way the cash from gold has gone
is highly instructive. Wages, £157,482. That presum-
ably "is the legitimate mine wage. Then, “ tributors
account ” £50,991; with which can be joined the item,
“royalty account, £16,915.” Who has got this royalty ?
It comes to within £7OOO of the divs Is it the Pearces-
who have such a grip on the North Woah Hawp ? The
last half-year saw payments for royalty of £598. Yet the
co. during the same time, went back over £5OO. The
; stone broken is poor, even for Ballarat East: 11,000 tons
for 28900 z. means close watching in order to keep out of
debt Yet the co. got.its shaft down another 100 ft., so
as to be able tQ open up at 1500 ft. , So far no gold has
been seen at that level, but there is always a chance of
alighting upon indicator nuggets. It is this hope, and
the agony and sweat of the mining system of Ballarat,
that keeps such a show alive. 1

South German has set Maldon (Vic.) in a
simmer of excitement, the like of which has not been
seen since Mt. Tarrangower and North of England were
blown out. It did not require any writing on the
wall to tell that very little fiddling was needed to
set the market on the jig. Two classes of inves-
tors had been at work—one that believed a mine
with a past like the South German was not a
blighted apple ; another that knew how a trace of gold
would set speculators ablaze. The development. has not
come from the old South German shoot. This has
never been hit upon since it was cut off
by the floor at 1700 ft. The co. has gone out
west and picked up the Nelson-Beehive lode, worked by
the Sou* h German Extended to 1600 ft. The South
German crosscut at 1900 ft. shows a big body of stone in
contra-distinction to a narrow reef exposed by the
Extended. Unfortunately, the Extended never proved
the stone of payable value at depth, so it shut down.
And the South German, where it tested the same reef at
higher levels, never got any thing, of great promise. The
“ buck,” therefore, arose from a receptive market that
had no’trustworthy pilot to shape a steady course. The
battery now has to tell whether the local estimate qf
15dwt. dirt is reliable.

Adelaide’s dredging ventures are sick. The
Echunga Proprietary—the most boomed of all —has gone
into liquidation; a new co. is now being promoted to
take the old concern over, but as it only proposes to raise
about enough capital to pay off the ,old co.’s debts, its
chances of success are scarcely worth mentioning.

“Paul Cupid”: “Jco Billycan” (who,
through my advice, got a ruined saddle, and a
hiding from his brother, and killed the brumby
with a spreader) has only himself to thank, for
any person who would tie a bridle-breaker or
young horse up to a wire fence wants his bumps
felt. And a person who, having done so, and
having cut the quadruped out of the fence, then
let the beast get away, wants his brain brushed.
And a person who—having done both these
tilings, and then killed the steed —sets out on the
war-path to destroy me, a person the world
couldn’t possibly spare, calls loudly for annihila-
tion.
A MODEL DAUGHTER.
MRS. GRIGG : “ Yes, I have a daughter, and I’m
proud of her. There’s never bin a bad mark
agin her since she’s been in gaol.”
“ Riverina ” : Bush horses meet with un-
common accidents. A young horse, galloping
about a paddock on a Riverina run, struck the
handle of an old plough, end on. The iron deeply
penetrated his breast and killed him. Again, a
colt, which was fossicking around a shearer’s hut
for water, had his head through the small opening
in the top of an iron tank when someone dis-
turbed him. Attempting to pull back he caught
his head and began to struggle. The edge cut
deeply into his flesh, but no help could be given
him, and there he struggled till he died. In
another case, a farmer missed several draught
horses, and about three weeks later found their
corpses in an abandoned hut. They had ap-
parently wandered into the hut out of the sun,
and the door had slammed. And that’s how
the bush nags die.
“Helen” : I hap-
pen to possess a large
black cat who hasn’t
any fear of snakes.
Two nights ago one
of my boys called out
“ Pluto has a snake
bailed up.” In the
moonlight on a bare
patch of ground was
the snake at bay.
Told the boy to get
the gun, and mean-
while watched the
manoeuvres of both
parties. When the
snake attempted to
move, the cat
pounced on it like
lightning, tossing it
over first with one
paw then the other,
much the same as
he would a mouse.
I could see the white
belly of the snake
gleam distinctly.
The snake thrust ;
the cat retreated.
Between feints and
passes the two were
mixed up pretty
frequently. I quite
expected the demise
of Pluto, but he is
still running about,
and so is the snake.
When I got the gun
I shouted at the cat,
who ran a few steps
towards me, where-
upon the snake
vanished. I was
always slow with
artillery.
“Jum” : Down
one of many shallow
shafts around here
(Grreenbushes, W.A.)
I found a snake about
2ft. long, rather thin at
that, and evidently in-
tended to resemble a dry
stick. At about every two
inches there was a mark as of a place whence
a twig had been removed. The under part was
from salmon-pink to a burnished copper color.
At each side, about six inches from the head, was
a small, flipper-like appendage, which fitted into
a depression in the body, so as to be no hindrance
amongst the brush. The flippers are
possibly only used in swimming.

“Elmore”: Some Victorians are giving
favorable consideration to a proposal to protect
foxes on account of an alleged
large slaughter of young rabbits.
Granted the fox kills a few
young rabbits when he has “ that
tired feeling ” and they are handy
to his den. But look at his
previous convictions ! Fowls,
chickens, ducks, turkeys, young
pigs, and lambs, all these killed
on the farm. Out in the N.E.
Vic. forests the brown curse has
accounted for nearly all of our
native birds. A lyre bird or
even a curlew is now a curiosity.
The plaintive cry of the little
bush quail is no more. Wonga
and bronzewing pigeons are no
longer to be found, and the
srnellful animal has entirely
obliterated both the large moun-
tain and the silver grey ’possum.
Last year in this (N.E. Vic.)
district he took a fancy to grapes,
and proved a most destructive
curse to many vineyards.

“ Nameless ” : I can assure
“Onk” (B. 6/12/’O6) that the

be a lonely lizard all his life than
go to the trouble of saying or
singing “Ho, hoo.” Being a
philosophical reptile, he knows
that Mrs. B.T.L. will come along
in the usual way when the spirit
moves her. I have seen these
lizards at their love-making (in
the daytime), and they go about
that with the deliberation that characterises all
their other movements (or lack of movements).
I heir blue tongues are their one vanity, and they
display them to everybody and everything on
every possible occasion.

“ The Bushman ” speaks :
Ive starved out in the bush. Never hungry, though.
That’s rum, but it’s a fact. Constitution or something.
Left Zeehan one time, half in the horrors. Cut across by
Strong’s Rush • through to Middlesex. Foggy weather.
Got slewed. Six days and nights; no tucker. Weak
that’s all. Very weak. No pain. Said to myself:
Hear them talk about starvation! She’s nothing.”
Since then I’ve been up to three days and nights, several
times. Terrible weak, that’s all. But —lgot her. Went
stiff in Hobart one time. Bloke said : “ I’d try them
stations if I was you. Bound to get boundary riding or
something. Quid a week.” I tried them. Up the Shan-
non to the Great Lake. Along her. Down to the Cressy.
Through the Macquarie. Up to Bothwell. Not a hope
? f ? bO L . Here £° es ! through the Linda. Got to
Lyell. Things dead crook. Through the short cut by
Tyndal to Mount Reid. Going up the White Spur I got
her. You see, I’d been starving, very near, for weeks.
Then nothing for a couple of days. Getting a bit old I
suppose. Anyhow, she “ gripped ” me. I knew what it
was. Took me ’bout four hours to go ’bout three miles.
Whew . all of a shake. Every nerve trembling. Gripped
from head to foot. Going off. Bah! What’s the good ?
Can t describe it. Deadly. But when you see any poor
beggar real hungry, you give him a show. Take it
from me, I know what it is.
Now, the rum thing about that lot on the White Spur
was, I seemed to be looking on at myself. Rather I
seemed to be looking on at the sufferings of my body.
Seemed apart like. Tell you what, I was nearly “out”
that time. No, I’m not whining about it, but now I
know what it is. Tell you what’s the crime of this cen-
tury—that lads (poor, little kids) should be hungry.

THE DRUNKS’ FRIEND.
Melbourne householders have been grumbling
lately that their meat is phosporescent. But
it comes in handy at times.
“ F.H.R.” throws a chance away :
Some years ago 1 was prospecting around Stuart Town
(N.S.W.). I was having a turn of luck at the pub., play-
ing nap. A rather uncouth individual stood behind me,
and greeted each win vociferously. I won all there was
there to win that night, about £3O, put it in my gold
pouch, and then shouted for all hands. After shouting
loud and long, the man who had applauded me beckoned
me away. • ,
“ I’ve been prospecting round here,” he whispered,
“ some time, and me and me two mates have struck a bit
er real good wash. I took a fancy to you, and if yer likes
to come out, yer,can get ther next claim.”
I was young and susceptible—well, a man will go any-
where at any time for gold.
“You come out with me to-night,” he said. “Bring
an axe with yer ; that’s all you’ll want to put in pegs
with, an’ yer can dig- trenches to-morrow. But mind no
one follows us.”
I got an axe, and off we started. Two miles he told
me it was to the claim, and when we had gone a good
mile I stopped. “It can’t be far now,” 1 said. “ About
er mile,” he answered. I set off in the dark again,
re-assured.
Presently he offered to give me a spell with the axe. I
declined, remarking that it was very light.
We walked a little farther, when he again proffered to
carry the axe. “ Yer might as well let me carry it a bit,”
he said. *
“Tut, tut, man,” I said; “it’s no heavier than a
feather.”
He walked on silently for a few minutes, then stopped.
In an aggrieved tone he growled, “If yer don’t let me
carry the axe a bit I’ll not show yer where it is.”
I stopped, and swung the axe as though to hand it to
him. Eagerly he reached for it, and in that movement
he knocked the scales from my eyes. Why was be so
anxious to get the axe ? In the bush with a stranger, my
pocket full of money, and—well, I thought of Gabbet. I
swung it over my head and charged at him, with a,yell,
as if I meant to behead him. With a wild howl, he fled.
I listened to the limbs and twigs crackling as my bogus
prospector left northward.
Next day my mate and I went in search of that pro
specting claim, but the man must have taken it with him

The Lunacy Department of Victoria struck
a very energetic person recently. He had been
an inmate of one of the Yarra homes for some
time, but was allowed out on six months’ proba-
tion. The day before his leave expired, he sud-
denly conceived the idea that it would be a good
thing to apply in person at the asylum for his
discharge. Saddling his mare, he set out and
rode from Euroa to Melbourne in 14 hours (over
100 miles). The asylum people refused his dis-
charge, and invited him inside; but he declined,
and gave the record-breaker of the establishment
a good spin over the paddocks. He was brought
back, and his sturdy little mare was turned out
in the grounds. A few evenings afterwards,
man and mare found themselves so close that
only a 10ft. paling fence separated them. The
temptation was t.:o great, and in a few moments
a bare-back horseman was careering on the road
bound for anywhere. This time he landed at
Yea, doing the journey (90 miles) that night,
with only one short interval of rest. It seems
a pity to have to state that the asylum holds
him once more.

“ Moon ” : Had a situation as cocky’s
companion near Cobargo (N.S.W.) what time
the bot-fly was botting there with much vigor.
The estate carried, amongst other fearsome things,
one large, hairy horse, with whiskers as long as
Dan O’Connor’s used to be. A mariner from the
Sobraon and I used, alternately, to navigate him
to the butter factory, and were everlastingly re-
minded by Mr. and Mrs. Paspalum to look out
for bots’ eggs ; neglect of that meant the sack for
us both. One evening I discovered that Bally’s
flowing whiskers were in a considerable state of
bot, and I promptly anointed him with kerosene.
Later on, Shellback spotted the bot eggs, and,
blissfully ignorant of my previous treatment, just
as promptly decided to burn the blessed things off.
Mr. Paspalum was just entering the yard when
the fiery steed passed him, outward bound. Pas-
palum fled into the pig-sty. I lingered at the
slip-rails and watched Bally till he set crimson in
the west. Then I stole sadly into my apartments
in the hay loft and put Matilda’s corsets on ; and
as I led her out into the night I knew that that
sailor boy was having the time of his life.

down a dry prospect-hole about 10ft. deep, near
the track from our claim to the camp, I saw at
the bottom a five-foot tiger snake, cruising round
at the rate of about seven laps to the minute. He
kept up his pace all the while I watched him, and
when I left he was going stronger than ever.
Every day after that we made polite inquiries as
to his health, and timed his laps, which gradually
decreased as the cold weather came on. When
the frosts arrived, he crowded as much of himself
as possible behind a chunk of wood, while the
rest of him stayed out in the open, shivering.
There he remained until late in August, when he
picked up his pace where he had dropped it,
and rapidly worked himself up to eight laps a
minute. The night of 29th October was dark
and stormy, and after tea Jim and I went
down to see how the dam was standing. Jim took
the lantern, and went on to see the girl, while I
started to feel my way back to camp. When I
had gone some distance, I got suspicious that I
was off the track, and, waiting for the next light-
ning flash, was horrified to find that my next step
would have landed me in the company of the
snake. I waited for flashes to show me all the
rest of the way home. In the morning, just after
daylight, I went down and dropped a yard of
timber across the prisoner’s back. I had resolved
that I would find out how long these reptiles can
exist without food, and now I’m no wiser than
ever. This brute put-up 278 days, anyhow.

“The Prooshan”: Be the carpet snake
and his swallow. A settler was clearing his land
in the river brush at Carr’s Creek, four miles from
Grafton (N.S.W.), and, about noon, his wife,
leaving her month-old infant in the cradle, in
care of her seven-year-old daughter, went out
with her husband’s lunch. While he was eating
and chatting to his wife, the little girl ran up to
say a big snake was at the baby. When father
and mother rushed back, they found a carpet-
snake, 18ft. long, with two coils actually round
the babe ; and it took the horrified father a con-
siderable time, with the persuasion of a clothes-
prop, to coax it from its-intended prey. After
killing the snake, a close inspection showed t’ i
child to have been slimed completely over—tnc
necessary preparation for swallowing.

“ Quip ” : Let me have a look-in with a
snake-yarn. A boundary rider, one day, got off
his horse, left his mates on the bank of a creek,
and went down to get a drink. He was just in
the act of squatting to reach the water, when he
felt a sharp prick in a place unnecessary to par-
ticularise, and at the same moment saw a snake
glide into some rushes close by. He rushed
frantically up the bank, rubbing the afflicted part,
and shouting “Boys, I’m bitten!” Well, they
cut the piece out, stuffed whisky into him, and
walked him about all night, and, after having a
pretty bad time, he recovered. Some time after
they were passing the same place, and the snake-
bitten fellow thought he would show the others
how the thing happened. “ Look, chaps ! I was
just bending down like this to get a drink ” (suiting
the action to the word) “when ‘Lord! I’m bitten
again (’” The poor wretch fell back and fainted,
but the other fellows only laughed. They saw
that he had sat on his spur.

“Eddun”: At Yarrandi (N.S.W.) is to
be seen a carpet snake, 9ft. long, hanging from a
shprt spout of an ironbark tree, about 40ft. high,
with a full-grown’possum in its mouth. It is
surmised that the snake went into the hollow
spout after the ’possum, and, in the struggle which
followed, the snake, with its prey firmly secured,
slipped off the limb, remained hanging by a
single coil, and by reason
of the weight in its
mouth, was unable to
pull itself back, and
died in that position
rather than
risk the drop
of nearly 40ft.

“ Prooshan ” : An “ Abo.” scribe recently
asked me to account for the immunity from snake
bite enjoyed by August Eiehhorn, of Middle Ade-
long, and other snakists of the bush. There is no
immunity; Eiehhorn has been bitten dozens of
times to my knowledge, but uses an unknown and
effectual antidote. Of course, a snake knows
when it’s mastered, and its master’s dexterity and
confidence render him comparatively safe. I once
saw Eiehhorn handling a tiger-snake, at Adelong,
before an open-mouthed crowd. Presently be
popped the “tiger’s” head into his mouth, but
quickly withdrew it, spitting blood freely from a
bitten tongue. He instantly retired to his room
and “ antidoted,” to suffer no worse results thana
hugely swollen tongue. [Since strychnine is not
an effective antidote for snake bite, if above is
true one would think the public (through the
Government) would find it worth while to buy the
secret. —Ed. B.] #

WINDSOR (N.S.W.).
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The village of the broad and long,
Of men of six-feet-two or so—
As if the mountains, tall and strong,
Had challenged them to grow and grow ;
That village in the days of yore,
With green upon its crown and brow,
Threw off the early name it wore,
And masquerades as “ Windsor ” now.
While looking at its homestead rows,
Its sky, and farms, and trees and fruits,
I think of men who doff their clothes
To strut in courtly Windsor suits.
The early people called the land
The “ Green Hills,” and it came to be
As “ Green Hills ” known on every hand,
Prom inland mount to coastal sea.
But ’twas supposed that Windsor would
Confer a higher social fame,
And though its hills stand where they stood,
No longer they inspire its name.
The new name brings up thoughts of kings,
Of thrones, and crowns, and pearls and gems,
For some, 'twas said, beheld such things
In Windsor, on the English Thames.
And so the town of burly brawn,
Of early homely rustic scenes,
Suggests, instead of Austral’s dawn,
The palace home of kings and queens—
Of Henry and Elizabeth,
Of pageant, pomp and royal show—
The gorgeous shams of life and death
Australia wants the least to know.

“Wang”: For general bush utility
fencing-wire (No. 8 for preference) runs bags
pretty close. First, of course, come fences. Then
the teamster, with some part of his vehicle or
harness broken, cuts a nice, long piece out of a
fence to mend with. Also, a few extra yards for
bucket handles, gridirons and meat-hooks. A
length of wire, neatly twisted up, and the jagged
ends pointed, makes a decent fork. The mean
type of cocky is the greatest user of fencing-wire.
He ties the tyres on his wheels with it, thus
saving the expense of getting them cut. His
harness is often a mass of small wire rings ; his
trace chains, every few links, are coupled together
with pieces of fencing-wire. The roofs of his
house and outbuildings, and the tops of his
stacks, are very often fastened on with wire.
His gate-latch is wire, and the hinges very often,
too. One cocky I worked for provided us with
beds, consisting of'two long poles thrust through
two chaff bags, sewn end to end, and suspended
from the rafters of the barn with wire. The
rabbit-trapper finds that the thickest kind of wire
makes good pins to fasten his traps to, and No. 8
is always used to stretch bunny’s skin on.

“Agricola”: Be that Canadian axeman’s
scorn of the Maoriland timber-getters (“Kati.
Kati,” B. 17/12/’O6). When the Gundagai-Tumut
railway was within eight miles of the latter place,
two Canadian axemen arrived late one evening
and asked the sleeper contractor what he was
giving. He replied, “Same’s t’others; arf-a-
crown apiece.” They simultaneously yelled
“O-ah, ’ell,” and started for their axes and the
camp. That night they “ calc’lated ” they would
each make about 15 dollars a day, and their chief
regret was that only 7000 more sleepers were
wanted. They displayed their axes—lovely little
toys, weighing about 12oz. each, with a razor
edge. In the morning when they saw their
“subject”—a good, tough, old white gum, about
4ft. through —they said “O-ah, hell!” again, but
with a very different inflection. By dinner they
had the tree nicely ring-barked, but their tools
were badly gapped. By tea they were well on
their way to Tumut, looking for “stooking” or
something easy, while the helpless Australian
went on cutting out his five to eight half-crowns as
usual. An American axeman isn’t worth more
than B|d. a day on our good old hardwoods.
THE UPS AND DOWNS OF LIFE.
THE WANDERER : “ Wot’s ther good er choppin’
them, trees down. Yer'll on’y’are ter turn to
an’ chop ’em up!”
“4E.R.”tells how one soul was shriven:—
Bill Mahoney, fast shearer, hard drinker, was dying in
the Bark Hut; and Long Maloney was acting as nurse.
Bill seemed troubled about what sort of a landing he’d
touch on the other side of the river, so I suggested to
Maloney that he ought to say something appropriate and
comforting, and calm Bill down. After some hard think-
ing, Maloney commenced: “Bill, you’re flaming bad.”
“ I am,” Bill said. “ Bill,” says Maloney, “ I don’t think
you’ll get any better.” “No, I’m after the seven,”
answered Bill. “ Well, old mate, I think —I think you’ll
soon be dead,” was Maloney’s next desperate lead-off.
“ Yes,” said Bill, “ I’m riding a fast finish.” “ You can’t
hope to get to heaven, Bill,” Maloney remarked, after a
pause. Then Maloney thought his hardest. “Well,
Bill,” he says, “ I suppose it’s all right as long as you gets
somewhere and don’t get left in the bush ; keep your eye
on the track, and you’ll see Jim and me shinning up some
day.” Then Bill died, and by Maloney’s directions I
carved on the tree these words : “Bill, died 1898. Gone
where his mates’ll follow.”
A hairy and unwashed member of the
Matilda Transport Company burst in upon the
sanctity of Mr. Public-house, and in a dry voice
asked for a bottle of whisky—“quick, as bis mate
was dying.” Mr. Public-house took the 6s. 6d. and
handed over the whisky, whereupon Matilda s
cobber vanished. In ten minutes he came back
with the whisky, telling Mr. Pub. that he had
made a mistake ; it was brandy his mate had sent
for. Public-house, Esq., examined the whisky to
see that none had evaporated during its temporary
absence, and exchanged it for a bottle of brandy.
Matilda’s young man again made an exit. In
half-an-hour he was back again sobbing like a
child, and explained to Mr. Spirituous Refresh-
ment how his poor mate was dead, when he
arrived with the brandy. He implored Mr.
Malt Liquor to take it back, as he was a
teetotaller himself, and besides he was 4s. short of
the necessary cash to bury his poor mate decently.
The heart of Mr. Blue Ruin softened, and he
offered 4s. for the brandy, and, after some
hesitation, the man who habitually struggled with
Matilda accepted the. 4s. and left. The writer
was there a week later when Mr. Adulterated
Ruin had occasion to open the returned bottle of
whisky. It was cold tea. He opened the brandy
with a shaking hand. It was cold tea. A heavy
licensed victualler was carried out of the bar in a
comatose state. The customer who was waiting
to be served stole a bottle of gin and vanished,
and the servant girl robbed the till while her em-
ployer was coming round.

“The Prooshan”: The fiercest-looking
animal the Australian bush produces is un-
doubtedly the tiger cat. I refer to the gent
measuring often sft. from tip to tip, muscular of
frame, sandy of color, hoarse of cry, and coarse
of brush. Get him, as I have done, at bay in a
fowlhouse, with three dogs at him, and you’ll
witness the very essence of fight. He is truly an
awful beast to tackle, as the dogs soon find, and
his teeth and claws produce agonised yowls
of pain. There’s only one way in which a dog
ever wins—by securing the loin grip, and hanging
there till death doth them part. I found an
immense brute in a snap-trap recently, and,
handicapped and all as he was, he easily beat off
my two dogs when they tackled him.
“China”: A
day or so ago, an
Australian was
inland a bit from
Hongkong in-
specting the
work on the
line to Canton.
“Plenty of work,
John?” he haz-
arded, as he
passed a group
of cadaverous-
looking coolies.
“My Lord, yes,”
he was startled
to hear, from a
begrimed and
aged specimen,
“plenty of
work!” Inquiries
elicited that
John had been
once master of a
sugar plantation
in N orth Queens-
land, and had
been squeezed
out by the
drought. Came
to China to get
funds to irrigate
—but his friends
wouldn’t fund
worth a cent,
and he drifted
to coolie work.
He confessed to
an insatiable
craving to get
back into the
C’wealth. Why?
“ Wages better;
living better;
everything i n
China’s miser-
able,” he replied,
in grammar-
school English,
“ Australia’s a
good country.”
I ncidentally,
John remarked
that the gentle
Kanaka is a bounder; that the Labor party is
no good, for it hunts the Celestial; and that
China is worse for allowing him to be hunted.
“Well, so long,” he smiled, in parting—and the
expression brought back visions of golden sun-
light in a better and cleaner land.

“ F.H.R.” : “ Falder ” (B. 20/12/’O6),
writing about sleeper-cutting tallies, doesn’t
classify according to size. Railway sleepers for
Australian lines generally run in two sizes, viz.,
9x10x51 (termed “nines”)andBx9x4 (or “eights ).
Around Gilgandra (N.S.W.), where the timber has
been “cut out” for years, two men recently
averaged Btolo “ nines ” per day. Given good -
splitting ironbarks either of these men would cut
18 “eights” in a day. Sleepers for export are
usually only 7ft. long. So a first-class man could,
as “ Cocky ” says, cut his 18; but such a man would
not work for the “ pound-a-week-and-sleep-in-
the-loft” terms “ Cocky’s ” class offers. The test
cutter I ever knew was one E. Braithwaite. His
sleepers were like dressed timber, rarely showed
the mark of an axe, and generally “passed
themselves. 1_
SHE WASN’T TAKING ANY.
PARSON (to miner’s wife): "Ahem! lam building a new church , and want you to buy a
few weatherboards.”
WIFE (to husband): “ Well. Bill, we might as well buy them from him as from anyone else.”
“S. Gippsland”: “Alba’s” drill-fore-
man (B. 20/12/’O6), who couldn’t pick up a drill-
head out of a hole 200 ft. deep, should stick to the
humbler brace-and-bit. Writer has been employed
for some time on a Government drill in South
Gippsland, and such little incidents (they don’t
reach the height of accidents) as “Alba” de-
scribes are frequent. A length of rods, with core
barrel, bit, &c., attached, is often dropped,
through careless handling or other cause, and the
foreman who could not have the lot out within an
hour ought to give the game best. Each connect-
ing rod (about 16ft. in length and 3in. diameter)
has a female thread at the upper end, into which
the next rod is screwed, and this screwing-in can
be performed with very little difficulty at any
depth. The strain of boring will, however, some-
times break a rod clean in two, and the recovery
of the lower portion with its attachments pre-
sents a more difficult problem. In this case, a
threaded and tapered “ fishing-tap ” is used,
which, after more or less manoeuvring, is screwed
into the broken rod, cutting a thread sufficient to
ensure the grip necessary to raise the missing
portion to the surface.
* * * * .
“Agricola”: “Prooshan” (B. 27/12/’O6)
errs in supposingthat throughout N.S.W. bullock-
names are much the same. Each district—which
usually means each family of bullocks—sticks
religiously to its own names,though some may be
casually common to all parts of N.S.W. In this
district an “old man” bullocky owns a team
named as follows: Baker, Butcher, Eiddler,
Roper, Bally, Jerry, Poley, Pilot, Beauty,
Cherry, Plum, Straw (short for Strawberry),
Kruger, Cronje, Bruiser, and Dump. There are
other bullockies round about, all related in some
way to the “old man,” and they all include at least
eight of these names in their teams. A bullocky
will drive a team for fifty years, and stick to the
same names the whole time. When Fiddler
breaks his leg, or his neck, his successor takes up
his name as well as his position in the team. That
is why you may hear “ Cherry” called to a white
beast.
* * * *
“A.Z.”: A peculiar way of catching fish
is practised by the blacks on Cooper’s Creek(S.A.).
Near the Queensland border the “creek” is really
a chain of water-holes, some of them from fifty to
a couple of hundred yards wide. The connecting
stream is narrow and shallow. In certain seasons
long snaky weeds grow in a dense mass in the
water of these narrow portions. The precedure
is for two parties of niggers to start, say fifty
yards apart (one up and the other down stream),
and gradually work the weeds into a roll. Once
started the rest is easy as the rolled weeds gather
up all in front and eventually form amoving dam.
As the distance diminishes between the rolling
masses you can see the fish (generally a kind of
perch) jumping and scurrying in all directions.
It is a primitive form of fishing but it is very
successful and generally results in a protuberant
and sleepy nigger.

“ Homo ” : Be question raised by “Silas
(B. 27/12/’O6) anent a bullock being unable to work
alongside a bull for any lengthy period. My
theory is that the bull’s mind is generally so
engrossed with themes of romance that he displays
a great lack of interest in the work in hand, and
consequently allows a very unequal share of it to
fall on the shoulders of the honest, unromantic
worker by his side.
THE DEVIL AT MONARO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis by Micky, the stumper, the story is told,
Who confesses the fright made him silly,
Yet there isn’t a man that’s more truthful or bold
From Bombala to Yarrangobilly.
It was Micky himself saw the Devil pass by—
It was on the big culvert, or near it,
And for fear you should doubt me, and think that I he,
’Tis in Micky’s own words your shall hear it.
“ I was shtrollin’,” says he, “ on a dark, moonless night,
To me camp, near the edge of the clearin’,
I was not to say sober, and not to say tight.
But no mortal or baste was I fearin’.
Not a sound could I hear but the voice of a frog ;
And he soothed me that way wid his croakin’
That I lit up me pipe and sat down on a log,
And enj’yed mesilf pacefully shmokin’.
“ Faith, I didn’t have long to me rist to attind,
For I hadn’t had time to shtart shnorin’
Whin me heart shtarted jumpin’, for just round the
bind
The ould Devil came puffin’ an’ roarin’.
He’d the shpeed of a comet, the voice of a bull,
While his one eye so brightly was stharin’
That it lit up the road like the moon at the full,
And bedazzled me sight wid its glarin’.
“ Not a cry could I cry. Not a word could I shpeak.
Not a prayer could me frozen tongue utther.
But I ran for the culvert that crosses the creek
Like a hare, wid me heart in a flutther.
I was not very hopeful) run which way I would ;
I made sure the nixt minute he’d find me ;
But I made for the culvert as fast as I could,
While the Devil came troctin’ behind me.
“ All the sins of me youth crowded thick on me mind.
All the crimes I’d been afther committin’;
So I thried, as I ran, a few prayer-words to find,
But I couldn’t find one that was fittin’.
All me wind was clane gone, I was ready to faint,
Wid the shweat in me eyes, fit to blind me ;
And I didn’t know whether to call on a saint
Or compound with the Devil, behind me.
«I arrived at the culvert, and that purty quick,
But the Devil, I found, could outrun me ;
For he came up behind and he gave me a kick,
And clane into the wather it shpun me.
I’d been kicked by a horse, I’d been tossed by a cow,
In a scrum or a fight I could revel,
I’d been flattened at football, but never, till now,
Had I been a football for the Devil.
“ When I crept up the bank, sore and wet, but alone,
You may bet I did not thry to find him ;
The Devil, his eye, and his “ Toot Toot” were gone,
But the shmell of his breath shtayed behind him.
Phwat was that ? Who said mothor-car 1 You, Billy
Dunn?
If you did, faith, your eyes I’d be sbwellin’.
Bring the best man you have and I’ll fight him for fun.
Just to prove it’s the truth I’ve been tellin’.’’

in the A.M.P. Society, having taken out a policy
on Aug. 15, 1849. For 56 years he had kept it up.
Colonel Gerald Campbell gives up command
of the N.S.W. Scottish Rifles this year ; he has
been appointed to the command of the Sydney
Garrison Force. Colonel Campbell has been a
member of the regiment since 1885.
On B. R. Wise’s prompting, a question in
the House of Commons by Gilbert Parker got
from the British Government an assurance that
under the New Hebrides Anglo-French agree-
ment Australian barristers will have the right to
legal appointments in those islands.
Nine surviving pioneers of ’36, hale and
hearty, signed the roll-call at Glenelg (S.A.), on
Commemoration Day, Dec. 28. They were—
W. L. Beare, H. T. Morris, Mrs. Eli Lovelock,
T. G. Adams, J. Chittleborough, W. Othams,
W. Chittleborough, W. Grey, and Daniel Wick-
ham.
Journalist John Gale, of “The Elms,”
Queanbeyan, celebrated his golden wedding on
January 3. Mr. Gale was wedded on January 3,
1857, at Wasrgallalate, Gunning, to Miss Loana
Wheatley. He occupied a seat in Parliament for
some years as representative of the Murrumbidgee.
Chief Justice Murray, of Papua, is now in
Sydney, with some of the Papuan officials
interested in the recent inquiry by Commission
there. Some, at least, of them will want to see
the Commission’s report, and know what is going
to be done with it, before they return.
HER LITTLE WEIGH.
"That man's wife must feel small."
“ Oh, I don't know. She says they average
12 stone."
There have been “converted” pugilists
before the days of “Kid” Wedge, the American
lightweight, who recently tried to knock out his
opponent by handing him a tract. (The other man
was so agressive that, finally, Kid had to finish
him off in the orthodox way, but that is a mere
detail.) A prominent convert was “Bendigo,”
the old-time boxer after whom the Vic. goldfield
is alleged (and denied) to have been named. The
Judders of the period coached Bendy till he was
an almost perfect Stiggins, and his pulpit yarns
about his “fight with Satan” brought numerous
shekels to the church. Sometimes Satan got the
best of the battle for a week or two when Bendigo
became very thirsty. But the Judders took all
sorts of precautions against their profitable con-
vert getting right out of their clutches, and Bendy
died in the odor of sanctity and the sound of the
collection-plate.
Aid. “ Bertie ” Kelly flattened out a pro-
posal that an organist, whom a firm of Yankee
agents has on hand, should be paid £6OO to come
along and give 16 recitals on the Sydney Town
Hall organ. “If we’ve got £6OO to spend on
music,” said Little Willie’s big and better brother,
“let us spend it on open-air concerts in the
parks.”
Taverner, who will represent Victoria in
London for another three years, at £lOOO a year,
will wear the official title of “General Agent”
instead of “Agent-General.” The salary of
Agent-General is fixed by statute at £2500 a year,
and Bent isn’t paying any Taverner any £2500
a year.
Groom, now Attorney-General, and leader
of the Bar of the Commonwealth, had a hard
struggle in his early law days. The ruling Philp-
ites, resenting his father’s democracy, boycotted
young Groom so far as they could. That only
gave him the mettle for a fight which has landed
him in his present position.
One Picton (M.L.) man has persisted in
living for 104 years. His name is Smith —Bill
Smith. His first appearance at a kinematograph
show in M.L. on his 104th birthday was made the
occasion of inquiry. It is alleged that William
has kept on living merely because he had got in
the habit of using sulphur as snuff.
A few days before a N.S. W. border resi-
dent died he carefully dictated the advertisements
that were to appear relative to his decease. He
included thanks for the floral wreaths that had
not yet arrived, and “ also to Dr. So-and-So for
his kind attention.” He further insisted on add-
ing to the death notice some verses calling him-
self “dearest loved one,” and asserting that “thy
memory will be cherished till we see thy Heavenly
face.” Either a humorist or a maniac for method.
David Billington, English ex-amateur
champion, has been giving displays in Adelaide,
and got himself examined by the ’Varsity Pro-
fessor of Anatomy, who locates his power in the
muscular thighs and an abnormal chest develop-
ment. Billington is a lightweight—lOst.—and
stands only sft. 7,£in. Unlike most swimmers, he
does not care for diving, but at all other fancy
feats he is very strong ; he makes a special feature
of imitating the style of the late Barney Kieran—
“ the finest swimmer I have ever seen,” says
Billington, handsomely.
When Premier Ward retires to the more
decorative and less exacting billet of High Com-
missioner for M.L., he will leave only two pos-
si ble successors. Minister for
Marine and Labor J. G.
Millar, ex-strike leader and
seaman, is closely in touch
with M.L. Labor sentiment,
and, like Seddon, grown Con-
servative with his years, has
won the canny confidence of
the commercial men of Dune-
din. It was the business
vote that put the bluff sea-
man in at the last election.
Undoubtedly he would prove
for the majority a more
popular Premier than Ward,
hampered by his title and
presumed “society” lean-
ings. Millar’s sole rival is
McNab, the dour Scot land-
owner, Minister for Lands,
whose statesmanlike Land
Bill (incidentally preventing
himself from buying another
acre of land in M.L.) has
brought him into sudden
prominence as a verra strong
mon. McNab twice declined
office under Seddon, and has
a reputation for sturdi-
ness, straightforwardness and
silence. McNab’s hobby is
expensive diggings into the
valuable records of American
whaling adventure on the
M.L. coasts, preserved in
the logs of old whaling cap-
tains in American ports. He
dug up much interesting
matter during a recent trip
to Salem. Millar, the older
man, will probably win the
Premiership by a nose.
Meantime, Ward smiles and
genially placates bis uneasy team.
Died, at Dunedin (M.L.), aged 81, Hugh
Gourlay, ex-M.L.A., ex-mayor of the city, ex-
Chairman of the Harbor Board, ex-undertaker,
and now, last of all, ex-Gourlay. Although he
had been most of the big things in Dunedin, he
was only a moderately small whale. For nearly
50 years no self-respecting Dunedin corpse suffered
itself to be planted without passing through
Gourlay’s hands. He was an inscrutable old
chap ; no one could ever find out what his religion
really was. He had seats in St. Josephs (R.C.),
St. Paul’s ( Anglican), and Knox Church (Scotch-
byterian), which variety of religious beliefs pro-
bably accounted for the large success of his big
planting business.
Died in Sydney, last week, one Henry
Joyner, aged 90. Until quite lately every Sunday
this silvery-headed old gentleman, bent and slow
of step, walked from Rushcutters’ Bay to the
Hyde Park Unitarian Church, which he had
attended ever since it had been opened. He had
“sat under” all its preachers, from the ill-fated
Pillars to George Waiters.
In the book-publication of his sensational
sermons on the sins of London Smart Set, Father
Vaughan is
.... proud to think that, if my father was one
of twenty children, I myself am one of fourteen.
A good subject for pride ! But the professionally
celibate Father Vaughan refuses to think about
the grand-children.
A weary hotel pianist in Melbourne found
a simple way to die. He went to sleep on the
sofa and fell off, with his mouth and nose in the
hearthrug. And that evening he had said
“ Thank-you-I-don’t-mind” so often that he
couldn’t turn his head, and so he was suffocated.
Which shows that a man’s own elbow can some-
times hit him disastrously.
Senator Ted Russell is a curiosity. Apart
from Tom Mann’s Socialist Club, not one person
in a thousand knows him even by sight. He is
only 28 years old, and a Warrnambool native.
Worked as iron-moulder, then became estate-
agent. Since Tom Mann established the Social
Questions Committee, Aug., 1905, Russell has
been so much there that he could hardly find
time for other business. He was honorary sec-
retary. Before this, he had been beaten in con-
testing South Yarra, for the State Assembly. The
first Senate candidates agreed to by the Laborites
for the Federal election, just over, were Barker,
Solly and Tunnecliffe. Solly chose to go for the
Reps, and Russell was taken on as a forlorn hope.
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION.
PARSON : “ Now, my little fellow, who
was Jonah 1 ”
BOY (contemptuously): “Yah/
Jonah and his blanky whale/
D'yer think I've
never read The
BULLETIN?”
A Sydney newspaper notes a circumstance
of 50 years ago, giving the bald reprint without
an explanation :
G. D. Lang and F. L. Drake, convicted some two years
ago of embezzling monies, the property of the Ballarat
branch of the Bank of New South Wales, of which they
were respectively manager and accountant, have lately
received their tickets of leave.
Lang was the son of Dr. Lang, of Scots’ Church,
Sydney, and the Doctor went to Victoria at the
beginning of the trouble, convinced, as were
hundreds of other people, that his son and
Drake were innocent of embezzlement. In his
efforts to obtain an enquiry, the Doctor was
heartily assisted by Charles Gavan Duffy, and
after a two years’ struggle the Government of the
day, if not convinced of the innocence of the pair,
was doubtful of their guilt. The bank premises
at Ballarat, in 1854, were of weatherboard, and
unsafe, and the manager and clerks had to “doss”
as best they could. It was conceded that the
money (some hundreds) might have been abstracted
by others, or over-paid in the “ rush ” which was
then a characteristic of old Ballarat. Mrs.
Drake, mother of the accountant, went absolutely
grey in one night over the trouble. As the years
went on the public believed that the conviction of
Lang and Drake was a miscarriage of justice.
The Bank of N.S. Wales of that day was not very
friendly with Dr. Lang.
About the most unconcerned person to
get a licking at the Commonwealth elections was
farmer Kennedy, of
Cobram (Vic.). A
friend saw him driv-
ing a harvester a day
or two after polling
day, and said he
was sorry Tom had
lost his seat. “I’ve
got a seat here,”
Tom answered,
“ that suits me just
as well.” At the
first Federal elec-
tions, when opposed
by orchardist West,
of Kyabram, Ken-
nedy stayed at home
on election day cut-
ting chaff. During
1903 elections, when
Palmer first opposed
him, the harvest
was in full swing.
Kennedy addressed
several meetings,
and found that the
general farmer-feeling was “You’ve got a soft
thing on without us bothering.” Wherefore
Tom said at one meeting: “ Now, look here;
if you farmers are going to put me in by staying
at home and stripping your crops, then I’m going
to stay home and take my crop off, too.” He
went home as be promised, but he got in all
the same.
It was charged against Senator Higgs
during the Queensland campaign that “he let
some work on his Valley cottages by contract
instead of sticking to day labor.” What a
familiar old fowl is this charge ! It has been
thrown up against M‘Gowen, the N.S.W. Labor
leader, and half-a-dozen others—and generally
without truth. But why does the Labor man put
his little savings against old age in cottages ? To
be a successful landlord of small cottages a man
usually wants the qualities of a usurer. One
can’t imagine a Labor leader making much of a
return out of that sort of investment.
According to an Argus man, who left
Sydney by the same boat as “Snowy’’Baker—
off to Bullville after the amateur boxing
championship of the Empire —that young gentle-
man was more kissed by despairing Sydney girls
than any whole contingent that sailed to beard
the Boer in his den. Girls kissed him in the
street, they kissed him on the Quay, they kissed
him aboard, they chased him down the harbor in
motor launches in the hope of kissing him some
more, and for miles the headlands were occupied
by clumps of foolish virgins, who hurled handfuls
of kisses after the Oroya. If all this happened
to a mere amateur, what will happen to William
Squires when he sails from his native land to
crunch the world’s best with his two capable
hands ?
Some January birthdays, from Johns’
“Notable Australians”: Editor D. Watterston,
62 on the 2nd; Chief Sec. Kirkpatrick (S.A.), 59
on the 4th; Treasurer Peake (S.A.), 48 on the
15th; Customs-collector Wollaston, 61 on the
17th; Justice Barton 58, and ex-Senator Higgs
45, on the 18th; Speaker Coles (S.A.) 65, and
Premier Price 55, on the 19th; ex-editor Henry
Gullett, 70 on the 20th ; Lands Minister O’Lough-
lin (S.A.), 53 on the 21st; Ethel Turner, 35 on
the 24th ; Justice Holroyd 79, and J. Stanbury 39,
on the 25th; Bishop Stretch, 52 on the 28th;
ex-Judge Bundey, 69 on the 30th. By a strange
concurrence of events, all four S.A. Ministers
were born in January.
Consider the bashfulness of Judkins (Re-
fuse of Refuse, l/l/’O7)
The sudden retirement of Sir Samuel Gillottcame as a
shock to most. Following 24 hours after my impeach-
ment of his position, it was dramatic in the extreme. On
the incident Ido not wish to dwell. It is painful to a
degree. I may frankly say that it was the most difficult
task to which / ever set myself. But, in the public
interest, it had to be done. For two years I had chal-
lenged the right of a man to own hotel property and at
the same time administer the law regarding hotels. But
no notice was taken. As recently as October I wrote to
the Review of Reviews concerning it. Even this would
not move him. The last shot was, therefore, necessary.
A man who was registered as the mortgagee of a house
which is a notorious house of ill-fame could not be ex-
pected to administer faithfully a law which, if so ad-
ministered, would suppress such houses. So I sounded
the charge. It could not do other than take effect.
FAVORED FREDDIE.
“Bertie tells me he taught you to swim in two
lessons.”
“ Yes; but I think I’ll let it take ten for Freddie
to teach me.”
A Bulletin artist, whilst digging over his
melon patch at Mosman, the other day, noted a
not-unmusical “ping” disturbing the gentle
north-easter now and again. In time he found
that four small boys, with three small rifles, were
practising on the next-door allotment. Now,
The Bulletin believes in national defence and
all that sort of thing, and the teaching pf the young
idea to shoot, and so on ; but if its comic artists are
to be made targets of in this fashion a halt must
be called. No Bulletin artist aspires to draw
fire.
The yellow Hibernian organ in Sydney
accuses the green Hibernian organ—there is a
coolness between the two that materially mode-
rates the Sydney summer heat in that quarter of
having an English-born editor, and being there-
fore unable to run “an Irish paper.” To give it
its due, the green Hibernian paper (the r bee-
man’s Journal) tries to be as Australian as a
religious paper can afford to be ; but this dreadful
accusation that its editor is English-born will
probably cause bloodshed.

“ Edyson ” : Carrol made his little pile on
the Bull Ant, a Gippsland field, gathered a few
acres about him, married and settled down. He
grew a family and some remarkable maize crops.
And Phil Baxter lived with Carrol —lived on him,
in fact. Carrol was a sober, industrious, cleanly
man ; Baxter was a boozer and a loafer. In
between drinks he boasted that he was the founder
of Carrol’s fortunes. “He owes everythin’ t’
me,” said Baxter one day in my hearing. “If
’twasn't fer me he wouldn’t have a bean t’ bless
himself with.” This made me curious. One day,
in answer to a straight question, Carrol explained :
“ Yes, he helped me to my rise. You’ve heard
how I struck the reef at the Bull Ant ? I was
coming across the flat when a half-drunken swag-
man stuck me up, and wanted the price of two
drinks. I refused, and he laid for me. We had
a devil of a fight, and he threw me heels over crop
down an abandoned shaft. I wasn’t found till
next day, and 1 had a broken leg and a fractured
collar-bone; but, meanwhile, I’d found the reef
where the ground had slipped away in a small
drive I crawled into. The stone was clotted with
gold.” “That’s all very well,” I said, “but
where’s the need of this deathless gratitude to
Baxter?” “Why,” answered Carrol, “he was
the man that flung me down the shaft! ”
Beauty was at one time to the great majority of
women, as a thing beyond—a possession for which Nature
was alone responsible. That’s all changed now. With
the advances made in Beauty Culture it is possible for
every woman to have what at least is Beauty’s greatest
attribute—a fresh, radiant complexion. Mile. Helena
Rubinstein, the Russian Skin and Complexion Specialist,
has in every sense altered the face of Australia. Her
Valaze Massage Institutes, at 158 Pitt-street, Sydney, and
274 Collins-street, Melbourne, are equipped with every
device for the attainment of feminine beauty. The jaded
society woman, tired out with the incessant round of
entertainment, may, by the treatment of face massage at
these Institutes, be made as fresh as a rose again. All
the weary nerves and muscles of the face are soothed and
strengthened, the circulation of the blood increased and
all the pores spurred into their natural activity. Sittings
from 4s. 6d. Then the removal of serious beauty
blemishes is also undertaken at the Valaze Institute.
Birth marks, moles, disfiguring growths, red noses, and
all the other list of hideous beauty ailments are removed
on the lines followed by the great continental specialists.
Of Valaze, that dainty Russian Skin Pood, no word of
praise is needed. It is the boudoir belief of thousands of
Australian women. Other toilet specialties handled by
Mile. Rubinstein are Rusmo Hair Killer, for the self
removal of superfluous hairs; Valaze Herbal Soap for the
complexion ; Valaze Blackhead and Open Pore Cure ;
Valaze Skin Lotion. These articles are sold by chemists
everywhere, or direct from Mile. H. Rubinstein & Co.,

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, January 8, 1907.
My Dear Arini.
Australia will presently harbor a Royal Prin-
cess. Sections of Sydney, especially those in-
festing Double Bay, are hereby requested to keep
their mental balance. Also not to bend the spine to
the risk of becoming permanently horizontal.
Princess Francisca Josepha Louise Auguste Marie
Christine Helbne (let me get my second wind) of
Schleswig-Holstein is coming here on a visit, and
Sydney and Melb. Govt. Houses are being made
fit for the numerously-named lady. She is a
daughter of Prince Christian and the late
Queen Victoria’s daughter Helena, and is better
known as Princess Aribert of Anhalt. But quite
recently her marriage to the German potentling
was dissolved by mutual consent. You may have
seen pictures of Princess Aribert in English
grovelettes. She’s rather good-looking, but, like
all the English and German princesses, doesn’t
know how to do her hair. The lady will be here
about Easter with the Northcotes.
A Melbourne man, who often heard Lord Hope-
toun tell the accurate story of his coming-of-
age splash, writes to me:—“ There was a great
gathering of the clan Hope and a week’s fes-
tivities, including a Sunday service at the kirk.
The family pew was orowded with Hopes. The old
presbyter preached a vigorous sermon an hour
and a quarter in duration with straw-splitting
arguments on doctrine. In fact, as Lord Hope-
toun said, 4 Like the peace of God it passed all
understanding, and, like His mercy, he thought it
was going to endure for ever.’ Before its close,
the preacher spoke of the futility of human aspir-
ations, and, waving his arm at large from his
three-decker pulpit, but more particularly in-
cluding the family pew, loudly proclaimed
‘ The world is full of blasted hopes.’ Lord Hope-
toun was sure he meant 4 Hopes ’ to have a capital
letter from the emphasis with which it was
spoken.”
In the days when I used to pore over Holy
Writ and religious literature I would ponder with
a great ponderation on that mysterious, unnamed
sin known as “the sin against the Holy Ghost”
—the one unforgiveable sin. But, long ago, I
personally put a name to it. It is cruelty to little
children. If the present Government, or the one
in the near future, doesn’t do something to aid
the work begun by that most charitable and
earnest group of workers, the Child Study Associ-
ation, it (the Government) will be guilty of the sin
for which there is no pardon.
On Saturday Mr. and Mrs. Henry Willis, of
Middle Harbor, entertained 16 children —“cases”
of the Child Study Association —and their mothers
at “ Innisfalien,” their place in Middle Harbor.
Dr. Carrol, who founded the Association seven or
eight years ago, and Mrs. Izett and Miss Nellie
Sadler, honorary workers for the charity, accom-
panied the picnic and interpreted the “cases” to
the outsider. “That child”—a lovely girl of
seven, speechless, and with paralysed legs—“we
found dying in her mother’s arms. She is men-
tally deficient, but will recover in brain and body.
Just now she is equal to a year or so old child in
intelligence, and we’ve only had her for five
months. All these cases are recovering under
proper feeding.” Another poor little girl who
used to shove along an organ for a blind father
did so in chronic agony from a broken back. She
had fallen off a swing and the spine had 4 4 buckled ”
out to a point. (Just here you may recall Mrs.
Browning’s “The child’s sob in the silence
curses deeper than the strong man in his wrath.”)
The C. S. Association took the child from her
hard labor, and, after many useless appeals to
many persons, it got for her a surgical belt from
Rev. Father Bridges. The child’s back is now no
longer quite a deformity, and will improve with
time. But food, very good food and plenty of it,
was necessity, and this, as in other cases, the
struggling society had to supply in the patient’s
own home.
Other cases—that infant in arms, that jolly
little boy, that big girl of twelve with the
intelligence of a good-natured baby of two years—
they were all seemingly doomed to the tomb or
the idiot asylum when the Association brought
them to Dr. Carrol, and their mental and
physical regeneration begun.
But the small body of honorary workers is
dependent on small, private donations. The
Government hasn’t yet done anything, and the
daily press won’t publish appeals for help. Often
their funds are so low that they can supply only
oil—the best cod-liver oil is a necessity ; food
they cannot give. If it were not for a few enthu-
siasts such as Mr. and Mrs. Hogue, Mr. T. H.
Kelly, Mr. Bueknall, of the Registrar-General’s
office, Mrs. Wingfield Stuart, of Hunter’s Hill,
Mr. Ward, of Fort-street, the “ Innisf alien ”
Willises, and a few others, the Society would
wither away.
Death-rate of infants in Australia : Under one
year, 4800 ; under or about five years, 16,000 ; 80
per cent, of which deaths are preventable. With
better knowledge medical men and parents could
save for the State this heavy loss of population.
Now, won’t anyone reading this forego her new
hat or sell his tobacco-pouch and whisky-flask and
give the proceeds to the Child Study Association ?
Its hon. sec.’s address is “ Hollywood,” Botany-
street, Waverley.
Arthur Streeton is a shy bird to interview.
Wrenching an opinion, a descriptive phrase, or a
bit of news about Australians abroad, out of him
reminds me of a forest devil at work on big tim-
ber stumps. His inability to drop wooden beads,
let alone pearls, does not proceed from a
lack of ideas. Few men can better appreciate the
light that is on land and sea; but his brush, not his
tongue, is his medium of expression. He can’t
even talk about the light—although he will caper
like a kid at sight of a pot-boiler sunset over
Middle Harbor. Ask him if he saw much of
Gwendoline Snooker in London or elsewhere, and
he’ll tell you, 44 Yes, I—mind, this is not for pub-
lication ? ” You promise, while your eyes pop
and your ears prick with anticipation. “ Well, I
saw Miss Snooker in the New Gallery, one day.
She was looking all right, but she said the London
winter didn’t suit her.” “Is this the neivest
humor?” you ask him, sarcastic like. “Eh?”
says Arthur, with a puzzled, soused look.
Awhile ago someone wrote me asking if there
were any Australian composers, and, if so, who
are they. Here are all the well known : John
Delaney, Alfred Hill, Ernest Truman, Arnold
Mote, Chris. Hellemann, August Siede, John M.
Stephens, N. J. Gehde, Arthur Mason, William
Biggs, Miss Woolley, Maud Fitzstubbs, Esther
Kahn, May Summerbelle and Sylvia Blackston.
Composers who are Australian by adoption are :
Arundel Orchard, Hector Maclean, Ed. Beaupuis,
F. Wynn Jones, Lieut. Bentley, Alexander Rea,
Laurance Phillip and G. Lardelli. Quite a
respectable list.
A great sufferer from chronic indigestion con-
sulted a London specialist, and, after exhaustive
examination and inquiries, the doctor assumed &
restful pose in his chair, and asked, “ Are you, to
a certain extent, a leisured man ? ” The com-
plainant replied that he never did to-day what
he could defer till to-morrow. “Would your
means,” pursued the doctor, “allow your taking
an extended holiday ? Far out of England, for
instance ? ” The non-digester replied that he was
a fairly rich man, and ready to take any
journey that would tend to keep him overground.
“Then,” the doctor was impressive, “take the next
steamer to Queensland, in Australia, and almost
live on a fruit called the paw-paw. There is no
better remedy for your complaint known to
science than the paw-paw. By all means go to
Queensland.” The sick man fanned himself vio-
lently with his walking-cane. “ Great Heavens,”
he said “I’ve just come from there.”
On the last Saturday of last year two Hawkes-
bury families of ancient date joined hands in
matrimony, when Mr. C. J. Cornwell, eldest son
of Amos Cornwell, of Richmond, was wedded to
Miss Elsie Mabel Dunstan, of Spring Grove,
Kurrajong. The Cornwells and the Dunstans
date back to the twenties, the Dunstans being
chiefly at Wilberforce, the Cornwells at Rich-
mond.
The Mayoral Allen Taylors went out ofoffice with
yester-year. Mr. Taylor put himself out by voting
against himself, and for Mr. Thomas Hughes. It
was a noble act, but—well, he should have waited
until he had asked his wife if she were willing to be
shot out of office by her husband’s hand. The
Taylors were a generous, capable and suitable
pair of civic rulers for an Australian city ; and, as
for the lady especially, her skill in organising
charitable schemes hasn’t hitherto been equalled
by any Mayoress. The Thirlmere home for
women remains a fair remembrancer of her 24
months of office.
The Thomas Hughes pair, who have taken up
the running, know the tracks already. They have
been there before. The lady is tactful and well
liked, and when the season gets cooler and more
Easterwards, she will stand in the Town Hall,
after the time-honored mayoress pose, with a
huge posy, until her feet swell with standing and
her hand with shaking, and listen to a long, long
stream of callers tell her how glad they are that
she is there.
That decorative cleric, Monsignor O’Brien —his
white hair and violet stock make an artful color
scheme—is going to Colombo for a spell, after
getting the usual purse of sovereigns. No R.C.
shepherd can get out of Australia or shift to
another parish without a shower of gold from
his sheep. The man who really takes the champion-
ship in this class is Bishop Lenihan, of Auckland
(M.L.). He gets purses, motor cars and jewelled
crosses before and after absences, and on anni-
versaries of his consecration, and whenever the
wind changes and the daffodils come in. On
the slightest provocation all the faithful get
guineaitis, and work it off on Bishop Lenihan.
Sixpenny and penny grovelettes are never tired
of telling us that Queen Alexandra would not
wear an osprey in her toque, nor the plumage of
other birds. She’d die first. Also, that opponents
of the wearing of bird millinery have had female
detectives posted outside fashionable churches,
and in Hyde Park and Rotten Row, “ spotting ”
ladies of quality who wear birds. Yet Queen
Maude, of Norway, when she landed in London
recently, was “ wearing a splendid osprey plume.”
Every half-penny daily, and all the fashionable
weeklies, mentioned that osprey with joy and
reverence.
Mr, Ernest Milford, a Sydney gentleman, one
who loves music, had a look in at the M.L. Ex-
hibition; last month. He says that Alfred Hill’s
orchestral concerts are unforgettable and delight-
ful memories. The combination is costing £4OO a
week, and admission to the concerts is but six-
pence.
Talking of M.L., an extract from the published
report of the judges in the recent competition for
colonial women writers says, “for excellence
Maoriland unquestionably stands first.” Now, isn’t
that enough to make Mount Rangitoto begin
business again at the old address as an active
volcano ! Of the eleven MSS. selected from
330 entries there were four from M.L., four from
Australia, one from South Africa and one from
the Malay Peninsula. Mrs. Forrest (of Brisbane),
Mrs. Kearney (of Orange), Miss M‘Ghie (of
Gympie), and Miss Ethel Sutherland are the suc-
cessful Australians. M.L. names are not yet
available. The Lyceum Club will publish the
winnowed grain for the benefit of the successful
competitors.
Miss Constance Smedley (who is really the
Lyceum Club) founded the institution to help
women writers, painters and composers to sell their
wares at a fair price. Her scheme in regard to
the Overseas women-writers is explained by Mrs.
Helen Jerome, who is a personal friend of the
altruistic Constance. “The stories submitted
must not have been published in England before.
She even wants to give Lyceum Scholarships in
Australia, M.L., and Canada. The idea is to
provide clever young women with their fare over
and then take them to Europe for three months,
where they will meet Gifted Persons—then, after
the wanderers have seen and heard and com-
pared, and drunk as deep at the Pierian
Spring as time and other conditions allow,
they must return to Australia and produce
a work for Australia or else refund the Scholar-
ship money.” Miss Smedley may be a dreamer,
but what generous Dreams she dreams ! Anyhow,
one facet of her Dream has materialised in the
competition that has just closed. It will be
an interesting item—the financial return to
each writer of the Lyceum’s experiment. Real
interest of things boils down to a question of
“ How much?” Art for Life’s sake; not Life for
Art’s sake.
Another of Sydney’s very best-lookers (and six-
footers), Mrs. George Turnbull, has given up
housekeeping, and with her children gone to live
at the Carrington at Katoomba. It’s much hotter
in the mountains than in Sydney, but,' after all,
it’s better to get freckled than pickled Sea air
does pickle.
Majority of young, male youth of Sydney has a
glorious cubhood frolicking around our seaboard.
No wonder he (in his blindness) does not want to
spend Saturdays and holidays practising military
tactics and learning to shoot straight at the
invader. See Him in scores about the boatsheds
and outside his holiday camp in out-of-the-way
little crescents at the sea’s verge. An armless
sweater, a short-legged pair of pants and a cap.
But his color is the thing ! By now he is fully
tinted to a rich cinnamon. The white tent camp,
backed by the deep green of the bush, the boat
drawn up on the shingle, and the russet youth,
like a deeply-washed-in sepia study, looking out
over the blue sea whose salt helps to make his
acquired tint a fast color, dyed in the skin.
From the cables one would think that all other
cities but New York and Vienna spent New
Year’s Eve in prayer and meditation. “ Pande-
monium in Vienna,” says the cable. “A cakewalk
was danced outside the Cathedral.” Well, what
of that ? No doubt it was danced well. If it had
been danced inside the Cathedral, with the Arch-
bishop taking the cake, it would be worth cabling.
“Women drove about, lowering little live pigs
from their carriages.” Said pigs were chased
squealing through the streets. The Viennese
are a light-hearted people, but they are not
given to wilful waste of goods with a market
value. If the identity of the pork-wasters were
known it would, ten to one, be English or
American, or Australian. When the last is rich
and extravagant and abroad you don’t know what
he may do. “Broadway was blocked by a yelling
mob.” Pitt-street and Lower George-streets,
Sydney, of course were filled by a reverent con-
gregation exchanging Marcus Aurelius-isms and
selecting the star to which it should hitch its
respective waggon for the coming year !
As a matter of fact, our people yelled and blew toy
trumpets and whistles and played on concertinas.
Groups of youths went about hand in hand saying
“ Bah ” to other groups and laughing fit to hurt
themselves at their originality and naughty doggi-
ness. An eventful day like the last one of 1906
has to be signalised with Noise—cheap noise of
penny whistles. The coming of a king to a throne
is marked by expensive Noise —cannons and bells
and fireworks. But noise we must have, else
we’d forget our ancestors, who blew into conch
shells and screamed when they discovered new
drinking grounds, or wild carrot patches.
But our New Year crowd was not drunk. Not
a unit of it. Fifteen hundred tram trips were
made to Wonderland City, and 40,000 persons
were carried there; yet I’m told that not a
drunken person was seen in that crowd. Mr.
William Anderson’s staff is having a laugh at
his ear for music. On a Sunday the band struck
up “ Onward, Christian Soldiers,” and he rushed
out, saying, “I warned them not to play comic
airs on Sundays.”
The beautiful half-Japanese girl (her mother is
a connexion of the Imperial family of Japan) and
her English father are staying at the Carrington,
at Katoomba.
Miss Nellie Stewart attributes the growth on
her shoulder (lately removed by a surgeon) to the
wearing of that huge cart-wheel hat in “Sweet
Nell.” The edge of the brim used to rest on one
shapely shoulder. She begins her American
work in America under American management
next month.
Mr. Wentworth Dilke has returned to his
home. The call of property in W.A. brought
him hitherward. He is a brilliant man—with the
word rah’ly. He could say rah’ly in 444 different
keys. In fact, he couldn’t say anything else.
Rah’ly, he couldn’t.
Paderews ri is the champion rememberer. From
Paris he cabled New Year greetings (that arrived
at the psychological time) to a group of Paling’s
people—Marich, the managing director, Cutler,
Passmore, Southwell—and also messages to Hazon
and Lemmone.
If this should meet your eye (as the agony ad.
says) in time, don’t miss the St. Augustine
Orphanage Band concert on Thursday night.
Their playing is a revelation.
Nora Long, the M.L. soprano, seems to have
justified her name in London. She has furnished
a pretty flat in St. John’s Wood, and has sent for
her mother, who leaves here in March.
Highland Society’s New Year’s Night Concert—
I wonder if it is still going on ! I left at the
thirtieth number, and next morning I met a
fellow-martyr, who slid out after the fortieth.
Twenty-five items were programmed—and encores
made the sinful remainder. As Colonel Burns
has been lately entertaining the Jap warriors, he no
doubt is not waiting for the finale. Mr. Currie Elies
could leave his stock-broking for an extended
period, so probably he is among the audience that
stayed on. Dr. Taylor-Young hurried out in the
interval after the hundredth number, secured a
locum tenens, and came back to enjoy the rest of
the long drawn-out sweetness.
The Highland Society gave a good lesson to its
more aristocratic comrades, the local musical
societies, when it engaged Andrew Black atsogs.,
Maggie Stirling and John Lemmone at big fees,
and minor artistes, all well paid. How long
will the Philharmonic Society take to learn that
4gs. and sgs. fees lower the status of singers and
compel competent vocalists to live anywhere but
in Sydney?
The Oswestry Grange has just come in with a
thousand passengers. Another few such human
cargoes, and the population question will be
settled, and we can afford to tell Dr. Arthur to
take an indefinite rest.
Last week a motor funeral went through North
Sydney towards Gore Hill. There was a car
carrying the coffin, and a mourning coach.
A recent bride and groom went straight from
wedding breakfast table to a camp at Manly, and
“ mooned ” after the manner of Molly Wood and
her Virginian.
Mr. Harry Musgrove is in Sydney hustling con-
siderably over the Australasian Grand Opera
Company, which will open in Melbourne on
March 30, and in Sydney on May 25. Mr. George
Musgrove arrives here next month, and both he
and Harry and the promoters and directors see
medals on their chests and good profits in
connection with the venture. The grand opera
combination that sang throughout Australasia in
1900 under Mr. G.M. was a great financial success.
Among the singers engaged are—Studdeaaund,
the tenor at the Court Theatre at Berlin, who was
allowed by Royal permission to enter into an
engagement for Australia; Herr Mohewinkel,
baritone to the theatre of the Grand Duke
Hesse Darmstadt; Madame Heinze, dramatic
soprano, who is famous as Brunnhilda; and alsa
Emil Greder, the greatest buffo bass in Germany.
There will be the usual equipment of two sets of
leading principals.
A few “bits” of the celebrated Newby collet*,
tion of art treasures have found their way to
Australia. The Robinson-Grantham-Ripon col-
lection has been accumulating since 1660. Newby
(in Yorkshire) has, or had, the finest lot of ancient
sculpture in the United Kingdom. A tobacco-
box (to hold a year’s supply of ’bacca) from the
collection has been given to Mr. Owen Cox. It is
one of the modern items, and made of bullets
picked up on the battlefields of the Sebastopol siege
by one of the Ripons. The carving on the box,
showing men in action and vignettes of the fatal
fields, is curiously and minutely wrought.
A new form of influenza, a friend tells me, has
appeared in London. It affects the liver, and is
laying low its victims with great impartiality.
Remedy or preventive is to feed up often and
well. This is a good prescription to offer the
semi-starving—like the woman who offered her
baby for sale so that she might feed her other two
children.
Deceased millionaire Russell Sage’s widow has
been fairly worried by money-seekers and begging-
letter-writers into getting rid, en bloc , of nearly
the whole of her uncomfortable millions. The
worry will now fall upon her authorised distribu-
tors, but they’ll be well paid to stand the racket.
Sage was absolutely a mere money-making
machine. The richer he grew the more penurious
he became; and, with the acquisition of another
couple of millions, he would certainly have
starved himself to death.
Yours Affectionately,
Akknkhi.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 8, 1906.
My Dear Yarrie,—
High indignation in the Stonington quarters
chat Common Rumor and the Argus should have
attributed plans for quitting this quarter at any
early date to the Talbots. A perspiring priv.
see. coot-tooted from Macedon, where bushfires
and Bridge distract the tepid hours, to contradict
the statement. There is no likelihood of their
giving a chance yet awhile to Journeyman John
Madden. Perhaps the gaunt Vice Regal may
take a swift trip to the Cold Country on business
later on. Meanwhile, Mr. Victor Hood tells the
press with almost emotion that all other baseless
reports are unwarranted and grossly inaccurate.
It’s quite stirring to think of a priv. sec., who is
much of a superior automaton, getting into a hot,
eager argument on behalf of his leisurely chief,
who is still more of a mechanical object in the
eyes of the community he mythically governs.
The she-punter had her first spasm of humilia-
tion and annoyance at the New Year race meet-
ing, when the Chosen Person, with the assertive
nose and the demonstrative cash-bag, was barred
against doing any pizness with a petticoat. The
Flemington woman-gambler was an institution.
She watched the stable, followed the career of a
jockey, and knew the pedigree and pace of a nag
better than the peculiarities of her own
spouse. She struck up an acquaintence with
any informative male encountered in the
Bird-cage, and swapped tips with genial cor-
diality. One tip at Flemington made her whole
world akin. I’m speaking of the smart gam bier—
the woman who turned out in good style and
moved among the best clans. It was she
who suffered all the slings and arrows of outrageous
Judkinism on the Ist January. She has an idea
of secrecy in her betting transactions. Now she
has to entrust a commission to another. Her
gambling soul is no longer her own. She is morti-
fied, piqued, exasperated. She’d like to scratch
Judkins for all events.
The supper party has been struck a severe blow.
The new Liquor Act that ordains that no
drinks shall be served, consumed, or displayed on
the table after 11.30, came into force last week,
to the consternation of the spatchcock and
asparagus and champagne clans who make such a
feature of a two-hour’s cafe spread at midnight.
Parties unfamiliar with Parliamentary intem-
Serance found themselves constrained to gulp
own the bubbly water first and nibble the chick
after. Then the bottles were seized, the glasses
abruptly removed, and at 11.30 a dry meal started.
The indignation of some men boiled oyer. The
proprietor had to appear with the printed Act
and the list of penalties and a heavy charge of
apologies, regrets, and almost sobs. One of the
gayest habits of Melbourne is thus wiped out.
Madame Arral passed through this capital, en
route to Maoriland, the other day. Some friends
had gathered round, but the star looked solemn.
The financial straits in which Manager Bassett had
found himself had the effect of taking all the
bright bird glitter out of the vivacious counten-
ance. It was a sad-eyed warbler who sailed south.
Another gay Melbournienne makes for Colombo.
The trip is intended to give the Miss a chance of
forgetting a whole series of local romances and
one Court incident. In the spiced port, they say,
a woman may even forget her age. It is a
Petticoat Paradise.
The Landale couple face the Eden Chant in
January. Meanwhile, friends rally to their
house to view the Himalaya of laces and
chiffons that make up the bridal outfit. And
every visiting charmer endeavors to glory in the
review and to hide in a brave show of gush the
green glance of cankerous envy.
Mummer Roberts slowly creeps out of con-
valescence into rude golfing health, which is the
degree of physical fitness he himself reckons the
thing. On Saturday he witnessed “ Mother
Goose ” from a box, in company with Mrs. Tallis
and a party, and clapped favorite numbers with a
gusto that argued blitheness.
Squatter Peter Mitchell is in town, searching for
more curios for his Bringerbrong (which should
be Bringalong) station, and accumulating more
lucre by lucky speculation.
A marriage of interest is that promised for the
16tli, at All Saints’ Church, St. Kilda, when
Miss Aileen Rowan, daughter of Andrew
of that ilk, and Mr. Farquhar Macrae
will face the Voice that Breath’d. The
bride-elect is a thoughtful but healthy edition
of the large Rowan-Madden clan. The “but” is
justified. High thought and rosy health are not
close allies. Generally, the feminine who thinks
a lot waxes wan and lean. It seems usually
impossible to be fat and studious.
Miss Muriel Cumming comes back shortly.
The charmer has been having a high time in the
Mayflower residence, where Baronet Clarke’s
wife makes merry in an established, blue-veined
fashion. Report has it that the Clarke domicile
is frequented by much nohility—that earls jostle
on the stairway, and the coal-cellar is full of
honorables.
The Anglo-Australians in London have been
celebrating the engagement of Miss Shirley Hogg,
whose father holds property in the Macedon
district and has dwelt there largely, to Mr.
Norman Hamilton Smith, who is putting in a
globe-trotting term.
The John Cooks, of frozen-calf fame, are due
here ere the summer flies disperse. Mr. and
Mrs., plus a marriageable daughter, have been
circling the globe for something like the fifth
time. The Cooks are never anchored for more
than a year anywhere. The exigencies of the
chilled-meat business require John and Co. to be
in constant circulation over the globe.
The Northcotes have been taking much violin
music of late. Recently a quintette of the second
sex appeared at a wave of the commanding baton,
and gave some delightful Beethoven gems. It s a
treat to regard the lady’s countenance at suuh
times. Her expression is a melody in itself. He,
on the other hand, looks merely as a dutiful audi-
tor waiting for the signal to have his ear given
back to his own keeping.
The New Year race rally was a large one. The
Cliveden dowager swept a faint rainbow-hued
garb along the Terrace. The arsenic green, lilac,
and milky tones melted into one another in a
color ecstasy. A considerable person of interest
in her company was Mrs. Cruickshank, over here
awhile to suffer the congratulations of old chums
on her new engagement. The widow who has
determined to enter on a second martyrdom,_ as
the Swift Dean puts it, is a far more fetching
fiancee than she was in weed's as we remember her
a short stretch of time back.
A vision of grey splendor at Flemington was
Miss Millie Carter, who is a decade or two older
than her front name sounds. One of the cheer-
fullest spinsters in all the land is Miss Carter,
and her snowy top stands for rare honesty and
truth. This day she blossomed forth in faint
rose-pink, with real lace and a profusion of naive
bebe ribbon. The only pink rival of any account
was Mrs. Andrew Chirnside. A striking gown
was sported by Signora Dane-Valenti, whose
Celtic exuberance was sort of given a denial by a
faint aesthetic grey, further subdued by a fre-
quent black spot. A toque of magpie tones had
a snowy fuss of tulle and a pair of broody wings.
The Signora’s vital air of health prevailed even
over the rather mournful rig.
A languishing frivoller scattered pasteboards
for a strawberry feast, the other day, and garnered
in the acceptances. Then she settled down to kill
the intervening days with any diverting book
within reach. There was so much diversion pro-
vided that the party went clean out of remem-
brance, and it was only when plaintively reminded
per ’phone of a few dozen waiting strawberry
nibblers that the laggard hostess recalled her en-
gagement. She fell into the one dress that
could be adjusted in quick time, and rushed to
town, reciting a litany of apologies. She found
the spree pretty well over. Still, she was in
time to say “ Good-bye ” and settle the bill. The
guests had enjoyed themselves. After all, is it
necessary, once the feast is provided, for a hostess
to be present ?
There are no saucy trippers left on the Block.
Now the ogling rake and the club baldhead have
to pay for a view of the charmers in pantomime.
For all the city has been rifled of beauty, voice,
and brain to back up “Mother Goose.” The
smart girl has been all used up in the show. So
the Block looks barren these warm noons. The
question is, what will become of these fetching
young people when “ Mother Goose ” stops laying
golden eggs for J. C. Williamson and Co. ? They
can’t keep on the grease; they can’t all make
money matches. What’s to happen? It’s like
leaving loaded guns about.
The Bent Premier has taken the panto.-craze in
a virulent form. He sat in the circle three times
last week at “Mother Goose.” He’s evidently
getting up his jokes for a general election. On
the third occasion (when I was perched in his
vicinity) he was as concerned and interested as
the most intent child in the gathering.
Society still revels in the water-lily sort of calm
which sums up the demeanor of Miss Olive
Morrell most of her time in the panto. It’s so
Vere de Vereish. Of course, when smiles ripple to
the surface, the gallery boys start to like the
English Olive. There’s something sly, piquant,
knowing about her quiet little grin. Percy and
Clarence think it’s just sweet and aristocratically
constrained, but Bill and Ted, in the classic
heights, know better, and they get to liking
the gentle humbug more and more. We’re
all liable to love humbugs, and Miss Morrell,
who floats in and out of pantomimic sight
hap-hazardly and oh, so gently, makes a subtle
appeal. Her quietness falls on the senses re-
freshingly, and her two or three foolish little boy-
girl croons please immensely for that reason. It’s
as a lullaby after a brawl—a patter of welcome
raindrops after a storm of brilliant flash and
growl.
“ Rosna ” writes from Adelaide: —
Jessie Davidson, a S. Australian artist, has returned
from her Fame-hunt with an attack of malaria, con-
tracted while meandering in the land of Alphonso. It is
wretched luck ; for what is the good of being “ hung” in
Paris Salons if you can’t be the Conquering Hero after-
wards ?
No less than five “old girls” of one Adelaide school
have groped their way into the British Fog within recent
years, and committed matrimony with youthful doctors,
and the school begins to think that this record ought to
be included in the prospectus, among its list of prizes
and scholarships. Most schools make great capital out
of the successes of their old girls in winning University
degrees, so why not out of those who have captured a man
—a far more difficult matter at times, and certainly more
likely to appeal to the minds of an anxious mama.
At a ball on the China’s last trip, a cute fancy dress was
sported by a damsel who represented “ Baggage.” Round
her forehead she wore “ Not wanted on voyage,” and her
frock was entirely covered with labels. The rig cost next
to nothing, and was the most effective in a crowd of
costly garments.
At a farewell Town Hall warble on Jan. 2nd, Dolores
and her diamonds attracted all the Cream that hadn’t
gone digging the rustic potato in its summer garden-plot,
or wasn’t jaunting in the Isles of Maoriland. Dimples
wore a dainty, cloudy-blue gown, much be-jewelled, and
warbled more delightfully even than usual. Last time
this State heard her it was in the Exhibition Building,
a structure about whose acoustic properties it isn’t pos-
sible to speak and be polite. Therefore present show was
a considerable revelation. She left by the Oroya on
January 3, and a great deal of Adelaide went to see her off.
Mr. and Mrs. W. R. Swan, two S. Australians, are pay-
ing a visit to their native land. Mr. Swan is one of an
old squatting family who squatted at Bullaparinga and
various other places equally pronounceable. He has been
living for years in Penang, where he manages the Prye
River Dock, an immense concern which is just now being
sold to the British Government for some millions. A
year ago Mr. Swan committed matrimony with a South
Australian girl visiting Penang, and the wedding is
said to have been the most entirely ultra ever seen
thereabouts—a rajah of somewhere lent a marvellous
wedding-coach, with white chargers and jewelled ac-
coutrements.
From the Maoriland Exhibition: —
A Dunedin girl-lawyer is running a most successful set
of tea-rooms at the Exhibition, and is carrying on her
practice in Christchurch at the same time. It is the
swagger thing to arrange your suppers or afternoon-teas
with the “ Cherries.” One hangs out in the main corridor,
another is tucked away in a cosy corner, a third upstairs.
You pay your money and take your choice. The Cherry
girls strike a note of their own in the color scheme of the
Exhibition—cherry-colored zephyr dress, cherry-colored
rosette in the hair (sometimes real cherries), cherries in
their cheeks. There are flocks of them. They work in
relays ; when they don’t work they cool off along the
river bank. Beautifully kept lawns, cut into by scarlet
geranium beds, run from the walls of the building to the
very bank of the Avon—well planted with shady trees.
It is an ideal background.
From Brisbane: —
At Toowoomba (where all the good, rich people go) there
is no end of gaiety. Several Brisbane folk journeyed up
for the races and ball, last week. Lady Chelmsford,
wearing a graceful robe of eau de nil satin, point lace,
pearl and diamond ornaments, was there, and, before
forming the official set, presented to Mrs. Tyson Dovely
and Mrs. R. McDougall the handsome bracelets won by
their nags earlier in the day. Cousin Du Cane was look-
ing her sweetest in black velvet and point lace ; and Mrs.
Lyttelton Groom’s white chiffon satin was quite Toora-
ketty, don’t-you-know. Mrs. Brooke, on the eve of leav-
ing for Sydney and home, was her limp self in champagne
net over satin. Pretty Joyce Graham and Miss
McDougall were the debutantes.
The date of the Government House fete is fixed at
April 24th, when everyone who is anybody will spend the
humble shilling in the good cause of the Hospital for Sick
Children.
Two weddings of importance are fixed for this month.
Miss Foxton weds C. E.. Bright on the 10th, and Alex.
Stewart and Miss Best unite their fortunes seven days
later.
A number of Brlsbaneites are at your N.S.W. Blue
Mountains. Justice Real’s wife and chick are at Medlow.
Pretty Lucy Goggs and Mrs. Ernest Baynes share a
cottage at Katoomba, while Minister Denham only awaits
the recovery of his wife from a somewhat serious attack
of nerves to flit southward also. Premier Kidston and
his comfortable spouse are in Maoriland.
Yours Affectionately,
TRYPHENA.
“ Bulletinist” writes :
In your issue of 20/12/’O6 it is stated, “ There is a great
falling off in the demand for titles, and there is not
one prominent man who is ‘openly angling for a
bauble.’ ” What, then, please explain to me, is the mean-
ing of all the howl from the Premiers to be invited to the
Imperial Oonferenee? Why are Governors kept for the
States if not to supply baubles? Why were Alexander
Peacock and John See knighted if not as an open solace
to them for depriving the States of direct communication
with Downing-street?—such direct communication being
the main avenue to the bauble shop. Establish a rule
that while in office no public man shall accept a bauble,
and then you will have Australia for the Australians. Not
till then.
“J. A.C.” : The other evening I gathered,
from one of the fraternity, some particulars con-
cerning the “Gentlemen of the Street.” I mean
itinerant newsmen, pea-nut vendors, shoe-blacks,
etc., of Sydney. Among them are several who
have seen the somewhat vague “better days.”
One newsvendor has been a lieutenant in the
army, was decorated for bravery in battle, and is a
good linguist and musician ; another is an English
university graduate. One well-known character,
“Gentleman George,” in the pea-nut industry,
not long ago came into his patrimony, left “the
profession,” and took a trip to Europe. There is
still working a shoeblack who was once accountant
to a large London firm.
A strange mystery is reported from a
London suburb. A shopkeeper of extreme
respectability received a postcard representing a
woman lying in a coffin with the words, “ I
wouldn’t leave my little wooden hut for you.”
Upon this, he promptly blew out his brains. For
weeks a legion of detectives and reporters have
been attempting to get at the bottom of the
affair; but without success, and, according to all
indications, the suicide will go down to posterity
with the Gatton murders, the Man with the Iron
Mask, and other famous unsolved problems.
On a small island in the New Hebrides,
the other day, a white woman had died, and her
husband, being himself unable to read, had asked
an English friend to recite the burial service, and
he consented to do so. Unfortunately, he had
had that morning what he termed a “wet”
breakfast, which fact possibly accounted for the
perversity of the book in opening at the wrong
place. So wrapped up, however, was he in
solemnity that this trifle remained unnoticed, until
late in the proceedings he became aware that
he had been “marrying” instead of “burying.”
The service had been read in English, and the
grieving husband was a German who didn t
understand English, so everybody was satisfied.
“Agricola”: The murder-cycle! About
a month ago old Dutch Bill registered a vow “ Py
Pesemarlc” that no longer would he “pudt up
mit dot ol’ man worn bad t, alretty, by tam.” The
animal in question, during his prospecting opera-
tions, had let the water out of Dutchy’s race
times without number. One morning Dutchy
listened at the entrance to the evil one’s palace,
and having located him by his snores, turned the
water into the burrow, by way of making the
punishment fit the crime. Being either too sleepy
or too obstinate to flounder out, the old fellow
was drowned. In the course of a fortnight an
unspeakable odor began to trickle forth, and the
blow-flies unanimously decided that something
must be dead within. One morning, as I was
sneaking on to a rabbit basking just beyond the
burrow, I was astonished to see a flicker pass
across the entrance and disappear in the long
grass. This happened several times, and then I
discovered that a number of lizards were engaged
in snapping the buzzing flies. Then came a
rustling, and five feet of black snake glode into
view, and ambushed in a hole near the burrow.
After a minute or two the lizards forgot all about
him, and resumed their work, and two which
landed rather close to his retreat were promptly
counted out. Next, I slew the snake, but I re-
gret to say that up to date no one has killed me,
so that the murder-cycle might be more complete.
“The Prawn”: Lately, in my mean der-
ings, I came on a bush teacher, whose bottom
lip rested pensively upon his chest, or there-
abouts. As in former days I had seen him
skipping like the agile William goat, I inquired
the reason of his loss of vitality. It came out
that he had committed matrimony with a girl on
the creek, and, as no houses were available, he
was compelled to live with his parents-in-law.
TTis scholars number 16—and include one brother-
in-law and two sisters-in-law, also one niece and
four nephews by marriage, and all but two of the
remainder are his first cousins-in-law. At tea
time, ma-in-law requests to know what he means
by teaching Mary all about people’s insides—
perfectly disgusting, she calls it. Dad-in-law
wishes to be informed why it is that young
Bill, aged 12, has been going to school “goin’
on four year,” and can’t tell him yet how
many yards there are in the tank. He sup-
poses (sarcastically) it’s part of the new syllabus.
About three days a week an uncle-in-law, or a
grown-up cousin-in-law, sticks him up on the
road, and inquires the reason of young Jim’s late
arrival home “er Toosday.” When, for a compo-
sition lesson, young Bessie was asked to write on
“ What Dad is doing to-day,” a note arrived next
morning from Aunt Tilda-in-law, requesting him
not to be so inquisitive about other people’s busi-
ness, as she would like to know what he was doing
all day, seeing that Jane is going on nine, and
couldn’t read the paper for her father yet. The
teacher can only cane two out of the 16 pupils
with anything like safety ; to whack the other 14
would be a family outrage. He says that life
isn’t worth living.

A “ladies’ committee” that succeeded
lately in putting its Anti-Sosh back-blocker into
Parliament presented the proud politician with a
manicure set —a gentle hint of claws.
David Gaunson, who is trying to capture
the East Melbourne seat in Vie. Assembly, held
one of his meetings in a local stables. And still
there wasn’t a satisfactory percentage of horse-
sense in his remarks.
Labor men in Victoria generally blame
Anstey and his grudge against Hume Cook for
the refusal of the Vic. Political Labor League to
observe J. C. Watson’s promise of sympathetic
treatment to the Protectionists who supported
his Government.
The railway suburbs of Sydney are jubilant
because the Socialistic railways have undertaken
to dump these suburbans down to the office and
back again at a greatly reduced rate from J an. 1,
1907. The poetic injustice of the thing is that
these same railway suburbs are the hot-beds of
Anti-Sosh.
At Koroit, in the Wannon (Vic.) elector-
ate, four small blocks of farming land were sold,
the day before the elections, at the record price of
£100 per acre. Next day Koroit took the hint
and rolled up and gave Macdougall, the Labor
and land-tax man, 1100 votes; Robinson got some
600.
“G.H.”: Why do we tolerate those law-
builders who “ have regard to the late hour in the
session?” What would we say of the house-
builder who, when he saw the missus chasing the
fat turkey, chucked away his trowel, and jammed
the plans and specifications under the copper to
boil the Xmas duff ?
Mr. Bent’s—h’m—diplomacy is flagrant.
He has contrived to have for distribution, on the
eve of a general election, the following valuable
billets : Three Railway Oommissionerships,
offices of Chairman of the Water Board, Agent-
General, and members of the Licensing Reduction
and Land Resumption Boards.
Senator Longhead, in the Canadian Senate,
on the efforts of the British navy to interfere with
Newfoundland self-government on the fisheries
question :—
If a similar course were pursued with reference to any
question in which Canada was involved, the result might
lead to the disintegration of the British Empire.
G. Reid was a very ungrateful as well as
a very misleading person when he whined—in the
hope of catching Protestant votes —that the
Roman Catholics were solid against him. Not
only were some of his candidates R.C.’s, but at
least one of the R.C. religious organs in Australia
barracked hard for his cause.
There was a fair-sized negative vote on the
referendum to allow the alteration of the date
of future Federal elections. The question should
have been carried unanimously, but many electors
voted a suspicious “no” simply because the daily
papers urged them to vote “yes.” To vote
exactly against the daily papers is becoming quite
a habit with some electors.
G. H. Wise, elected in place of Allan
McLean, is a sturdy Federalist, with a good grasp
on big things—the N. Territory, the Transconti-
nental Railway, Fed. Capital, Aus. Defence, &c.
—and is a Democrat, with opinions that have lost
him business and votes in a “cocky” electorate.
He should partly fill the gap left by Isaacs and
Higgins.
Tory newspapers of Maoriland are advo-
cating increased Socialism as a remedy for the
domestic help difficulty. They suggest that some
of the municipalities should make the experiment
of establishing cooking, washing and sewing
establishments. In quite a number of sleepy old
English towns there are cook-houses run by the
ratepayers, which deliver meals piping hot to
those prepared to pay for them.
Wise’s victory over McLean in Victoria
shows what persistency and consistency will do
with the most obstinate electorate. His campaign-
ing dates from 1892. In that year he opposed
Albert Harris, a Walhalla storekeeper who had
the miners’ vote. The vote be got encouraged
him to try again in 1894, without getting any
closer. For a time Wise dropped politics. Later
on came the Federal campaign, and Allan
McLean toured Gippsland as an anti-Federalist.
Wise followed him as a supporter of the Bill, and
beat McLean, for Gippsland voted—Yes. In 1901
McLean jumped the Gippsland seat, as a Bar-
tonite, and Wise tried the Senate. Wise got a
good vote then, but a poorer one in 1903. His
fifth failure was against Keogh in 1904.
Anglican Archbishop Clarke, who started
in Melbourne Argus after the elections a fierce
sectarian scrap, by writing a letter which fell like
a meteor out of a blue sky, trembles at the
condemnation which his action gained him. He
now writes pleadingly for a “peaceful confer-
ence.” This is the attitude of a small boy who
helps to set a haystack on fire, and then invites
the flames to cease roaring while he discusses the
matter quietly.
Solomon, who is the most vigorous mem-
ber on the Opposition side of the S.A. Assembly,
makes no secret of his opinion that the National
Ass is an ass indeed for attempting to prevent
the people from securing an extension of the
Council franchise. It is now a moot point in
Adelaide whether the Council majority runs the
Ass or the Ass runs the Council majority. How-
ever, whichever way it is, when the blind lead the
blind they both fall into the ditch.
While the Australian Tory press was
cursing the Commerce Act, this was the view of a
prominent English paper :
We welcome Australia’s Commerce Act, and look
forward to the time when the British Government will
rise to the occasion, take a lesson from its sons and
daughters in the far-off land of Australia, and give us an
Act framed on similar lines. Such an enactment would
he an education to the people, who seldom know what
they buy... It cannot hamper trade, since it must make
for confidence and honesty in commercial dealings.
Judging by present indications, the carry-
ing trade of Asia is becoming rapidly Japanned.
U.S. shipping companies were preparing to with-
draw from the Orient, when the United States
Senate rushed through the Ship Subsidy Act,
with a view to keeping the Stars and Stripes
afloat in the Asiatic seas, and preventing the
Northern Pacific becoming a Japanese lake.
British lines that have been for generations
engaged in the Chinese coastal trade are selling
out to the Japs, and withdrawing what steamers
the Japs will not buy. Jap shipping has in-
creased from 150,000 tons in 1890 to 830,000 tons
in 1904, and the Mikado’s Government is striving
to make the increase larger by bounties, ranging
from 325. to 48s. per ton, for ships built in Japan,
and a subsidy for every 100 miles traversed. At
the present time Japan has a larger mercantile
marine engaged in foreign carrying trade than
the U.S.A.
A Maorilander’s view of Maoriland :
For some years Maoriland has been drifting along a
riotous road, squandering millions of borrowed money,
junketing footballers and politicians, and having a
raucous time generally. It has become a loud-mouthed
braggart, much swollen in the head, and it has created a
special department for telling itself and any misguided
stranger who ventures within earshot that it is the first
great wonder of the world and the crowning glory of the
universe. But there will be a brown taste in its mouth
some morning when it sobers up.
Now that the cold, calm Iceberg has got
into the Reps., he further trims his sails to catch a
favoring breeze that may lead to office. During
the election he had got as far as advocating
“ reasonable” Protection; now he tells his Warra-
gul constituents that he is in favor of “ effective ”
ditto. The erstwhile Freetrader and Single-taxer
is being convinced rapidly, perhaps against his
will, but strictly in accordance with his interests.
Bent’s Government is now inserting a
clause in its leases of Crown lands, stipulating
for forest replanting, and thinks of making
similar stipulations in closer settlement blocks.
When Bona Vista was bought the other day, it
was found there wasn’t enough timber on the
ground for firewood, let alone fencing or for
shade and breakwind purposes. Yet all that
land was once dense forest. Those early land-
grabbers were as good at destruction as they were
bad at construction.
Thomas Bent’s luck is sticking to him.
The revenue returns for the last six months show
an increase of £240,355 over the same period of
the previous year. Bent in his Estimates last
year anticipated a falling off of £249,390. If the
increase is continued during the next six months,
he will be left with a nice little surplus of
£500,000. The money will go to help to pay the
State’s debts—the best use to which it could
possibly be put. Bent has ensured this by an Act
passed last session.
Tommy Bent’s sudden outburst of benevo-
lence towards the Vic. old-age pensioners provokes
suspicions. For years Tommy turned a wooden
face to the appeal for better things for the pen-
sioned veterans, and he lets up suddenly in the
eleventh hour when not being stirred at all, and
offers 10s. a woek as a maximum instead of Bs.
Possibly it occurred to doubting Thomas that his
policy badly needed a little democratic gilding,
and as he was going to the electors it was wise to
assure himself a hospitable reception. Tom Bent
sometimes does the right thing, but he does it
very awkwardly, like a man unaccustomed to the
task. He should give himself more practice.
The “On the Land ” column of Sydney
Herald”:—
Australian makers have given the farmers the stump-
jump, the four-wheeled multi-furrow, with its handy
steering and other gear, and have, after all, perfected
more improvements in ploughs than the makers of any
other country. The patterns have been freely copied,
and many an imported plough made from an Australian
model is purchased by farmers who still stick to the idea
that the imported article must be best.
When will all the paper show as much sense?
The Australian stump-jump plough, by the way,
is the implement that has reduced the cost of
clearing some parts of the wheat country from £2
to as low as 6s. acre.
W. T. Stead sees politics in the music-
hall :
As I sat and listened to the kind of balderdash that
was accepted as wit and the drivel that seemed to appeal
to the intelligence of the audience, I began to under-
stand the part which the music-hall plays in politics. It
explained, for instance, how it was that Milner was able
to force us into the Boer War, and it cast a flood of illu-
minating light upon the secret of that colossal ineptitude
displayed in South Africa. That was a music-hall war
throughout. Our armies went forth to battle singing
music-hall ditties, and it was directed and controlled
from first to last in the genuine music-hall spirit. Jin-
goism is the ultimate product of the drivelling brain of
the dregs of our people.
Both the incapable candidates for East
Melbourne (Vic.), Gaunson and Weedon, are
Bentites. Bent has been asked to decide between
the two: but he says, “ Both are friends of mine;
both are supporters; I don’t care which.” Yet
Weedon says he has no political opinions worth
speaking about; and Gaunson, who supports Bent,
launches oceans of rhetoric against the only two
big measures Bent has passed—the Licensing
Act and the Gambling Suppression Act. Sammy
Gillott, who graduated from the Lord Mayoralty,
is likely to nave a worthy successor who will
exactly fill his shoes. No sane electorate could put
in David Gaunson ; so Weedon is bound to be re-
turned, and he will be another Gillott.
NOT SUCCESSFUL.
PATTENT: “ Your sleeping, draught wasn't a bit
of good. The beastly things wouldn't touch it."

PATIENT : “ The cats, sure. It’s them, as keeps
me awake."
After all the raving and quarrelling over
the union label sections of the Trades Marks Act,
none of the prophecies made at the time have
been fulfilled. There have been no boycotts, no
tyrannies, no anything. This gigantic power that
was being placed in the hands of the unions, this
fiery sword that was going to extirpate pros-
perity root and branch, lies dormant and quiet
and unavailed of. Only three workers’ labels have
been registered in the six months, and nobody
has heard a word about any one of them doing any
kind of harm.
Whispered in Wellington (M.L.) that Ger-
many has been trying to get a foothold in the
Kermadec Islands, one of the groups annexed by
Premier Seddon. Mr. Bell, the owner of Sunday
Island, the best of the group, is now in Welling-
ton laying before the Government the account of
how an agent of the German Imperial Govern-
ment tried to buy him out of possession of the
speck. Germany is understood to have desired
to establish a coaling station there. The Ker-
madecs lie out of the track of commerce, and have
no value other than of a strategic nature.
Women who went to the Flemington races
on New Year’s day, and, from fear of the new
Gambling Act, had their bets refused by the
bookies, are now gnashing their shop-teeth in
wrath. Melbourne Argus has discovered, and
Minister Mackey, on hurried consideration, agreed
with the discovery, that the only bookmakers for-
bidden to bet with women are those who are
“ approved by the committee of a licensed race-
course.” And the licensed-racecourse division of
the Act won’t come into operation until March 31.
Consequently, for three months lovely women still
has the gambling franchise.
“R.8.A.” from Vancouver (Canada) :
The Hindu invasion here just now, promoted by
capitalistic influence, is very serious. Many hundreds
have been dumped in the city recently in a starving con-
dition, and though mass meetings have been held at the
instance of the Mayor, and unanimous resolutions sent to
the Ottawa Government to stop a further influx, and also
deport those here, the city has had to build temporary
sheds to shelter them. The lumber mills are very
generally manned by Chinamen and Japanese, who are to
be found also in the logging camps, and the proprietors
are now placing there the Hind... An observant man
cannot but picture a serious future here for the
white man.
The United States’ industrial census was
completed lately, and Sydney Telegraph says—
“ Though wages per hand increased during the
past five years, the proportion of wages to the
total output was precisely the same.” In other
words, the United States industries are paying
their men higher wages as they become more ex-
perienced ; the manufacturers are not pocketing
the results of increased efficiency, but are passing
them on to the workmen. Which is something
solid for workman to look forward to under a
Protection that really protects.
When Irvine commenced his election cam-
paign in Flinders (Vic.) he made no secret of his
anticipation that G. Reid would carry nearly
every N.S.W. constituency, and obtain a share
of support from each of the other States sufficient
to give him a majority against Deakin and
Watson combined. So Irvine in his first speech
declared himself a supporter of G. Reid, the
leader of the Opposition. Within a few days he
had gauged Victorian sentiment about Reid
better, and said he would sit with and support his
old friend Allan McLean. Later on he arrived at
his final stand. “I will not support Mr. Reid,
Mr. Deakin, nor Mr. McLean; in fact I will
support no party at present in Parliament.”
After the election he defined his position thus, as
one of “absolute independence.” Now there is
talk of him displacing G. Reid as leader of the
Opposition.

of £5OO aside. Right up to the announcement that the
agreement was signed, Che people along the Parramatta
River professed to regard the threat to use the Nepean
course as mere bluff-. But it isn’t. And, from many
points of view, the Nepean course is far and away the
best, especially from a perch on top of the “gate.”
George E. Upward is to be referee, M. A. H. Fitzhar-
dinge judge, and the editor of the Sydney Sun stake-
holder.
The alteration that Durnan and Towns required
made in the rules governing rowing contests for the
world’s championship was one which specified that on
the death of the champion, the title should pass automa-
tically to the next best sculler of the country to which
the champion belongs, and not to the next best sculler in
the world. The alteration is a good one, as it will pro-
mote Contests. The next best sculler is sure to come at
the possibly unknown-abroad sculler on to whom the
mantle drops from the hand of Azrael.
# * * *
Webb, who beat Stanbury so decisively, ha,s
been invited tocome over to Sydney and take_ a hand in
the preparation of Durnan for his contest with Towns.
He will probably challenge the winner. March will likely
see another championship race on the Parramatta,
one between Charles Towns and Tresidder for the
championship of Australia, of which Tresidder is now the
holder. He, it will be remembered, trained Thoroughgood
when that lengthy sculler was defeated by Charles Towns.
A man who watched the race writes from
Maoriland : The local people were very disappointed that
Stanbury ceased rowing within sight of home, and
hundreds of them yelled “ Swindle ! ” But it was unfair.
Stanbury was played right out. The day was very
sultry, and down between the river banks there was
absolutely no wind to temper its fervency. Stanbury
tried to break Webb up in the first mile, which he
covered in smin. 30sec. (which was ssec. faster than
the Searle-Stanbury race in 1888). The pace, the heat,
and the fact that Stanbury was hog-fat inside, left
Stanbury very done up at the end of that mile, and he
had gained Only a length on the youngster, who seemed
quite content to let Stanbury make the pace. Stanbury
inade another effort and managed to increase his lead
from one to three lengths, but completely burst his
boiler doing.it. Scullers who saw him enter the last half
mile shouted that he was done, for his stroke had lost
its power and he was rolling Webb began to
draw' closer, till about 500 yards from home he was
level, and Stanbury, unable to spurt, streaming with
perspiration, his lips drawn tight, gasped out that he was
beaten. And he was—rowed to a standstill. Although
Webb'has beaten a great oarsman he has a lot to learn
yet, his steering, in particular, being very faulty. During
part of the race he lost lots of water through zig-zagging
about the stream, and it was this erratic course that
allowed Stanbury to get three lengths ahead. Until he
can drive his boat straighter it would be absurd for Webb
to challenge Towns.

The N.13.W.-S.A. Sheffield Shield match had
the usual result. S. A. went to the wickets and smote
157 on the scoring-board, the top figures being Jennings’
42 and Dolling’s 37. When N.S. Wales got going, only
E. F. Waddy and Cotter failed to reach double numbers.
Diamond and Hopkins made 246 between them, and the
innings ended for 573, a colossal score. . With N.S.W.
leading by 416 on the first innings, the position was hope-
less, and when S. A., in its second try, was out for 248,
N.S.W. remained victorious by an innings and 168 runs.
* * * *
Just at present A. J. Hopkins is the bright
particular star of N.S.W. cricket. He has made three hun-
dreds in four matches. His 108 against S.A. on Friday and
Saturday was a beautiful display ; 30 were made on
Friday, and 78 on Saturday. He hit 15 fours, and finally
came to grief jumping to meet one of Wright’s. He
missed, and next moment Gehrs had his bails. The other
century-getter and top scorer of the day, Austin
Diamond, made 138. Many people characterised his
innings as a better effort than that of Hopkins, but it
looked more labored. Diamond hit 13 fours, and then drove
M‘Beath for six. He tried to serve the next ball the same
way, but it flew high, and Mcßae, following it like a
bla'ckfellow follows the branded bee to its nest, with his
nose high in the air, took a catch that broke up the
audience.
• * * *
Noble had good and bad luck in the match
against South Australia, on Saturday. To begin with,
hie ought to have been out at the very first ball, and
would have been had the wicket-keeper not tr ed to do
two things with the ball at the same time, and thereby lost
it altogether. That was Noble’s good luck. Retribution
came when, having smacked up 99, he was deceived by a
fast straight one from Hill, which, keeping' low, took his
leg stump and deprived him of his fifteenth century in
the Sheffield Shield matches.

The N.S.W.-South Australia cricket match was
the first occasion on which the subscribers to Sydney
Cricket Ground have received anything for their money
for some months now. Apparently cycling is dead, and
there is more than a doubt as to whether the Summer
Nights Syndicate will hold a summer meeting there this
year. So, take it all round, the subscriber does not get
much for his cash nowadays, except the usual week-end
cricket matches.

The average Cornstalk is showing a disposition
to get swelled head because his State has got a bulge on
the rest of the Commonwealth at cricket. But, con-
sidering how small the Adelaide population is in com-
parison to that of Sydney metropolitan district, the Crow-
Eaters keep their end up very well indeed. Also, Ade-
laide is a city that attends strictly to business, and in
Sydney most of our crack cricketers are perilously near
being professionals. Anyhow, they play cricket first and
potter about at business in between whiles. But it
is th* splendid opportunities that the Sydney boys have for
practice that makes the city so prolific of batsmen. There
is no part of Sydney where the boy coming home from
school cannot turn into some park or other and have a
few strokes. That privilege is apparently denied to
Melbourne, where, although there is plenty of space for
practice, it is not accessible as it is in Sydney. Here,
even in the heart of the city, the boy can play m the
Domain. Every suburb has its park, sometimes two or
three within easy reach ; and on every one of them in
the long summer evenings the young idea can be seen
learning to cut and off-drive. And that is what makes
cricketers—opportunity. Someday Melbourne may see
to it that her children have more of it, and then probably
N.S.W. will not shine so brightly in comparison.
* * * *.
O’Connor’s failure, and also M‘Beath’s in the
recent inter-State match against N.S.W., emphasises the
fact that the present overwhelming strength of the Ma
State’s batsmen, as compared with those of the southern
States, is apt to exaggerate the work of the N.S.W.
bowlers, whose figures of late have always swamped those
of S.A. and Victoria. Last season O’Connor would have
been first bowler picked on inter-State form against an
English team. Garnsey, another Ma State trundler, is
one of Australia’s hopes for next season. And that hope
would be more rosy if he could have a chance to prove
what he could do playing against the all-conquering
Cornstalks, rather than for them.

Hitherto the only part of Maoriland that has
considered cricket seriously is the Christchurch end of
‘Canterbury. There they are more English than the
people of Bow Bells, and play the game as a sort of
religious rite connected in some way with ancestor wor-
ship. Christchurch has always affected to regard the game
with a sacred sort of reverence. The rest of the country
regarded it as a sort of feminine pastime, only fit for hot
weather. But the spirit has changed. The Marylebone
Club has extended an invitation to Maoriland to send a
representative team to tour the counties and meet All
England; and the Maoriland chest is swelling and the
Maoriland chin is exalted. The result is going to be a
boom in cricket.

Yet another argument, supported by facts, can
be advanced against encouraging cricket amongst women.
In a Victorian town, the other daj', a ladies’ cricket con-
test, “ in sweet charity’s cause,” provoked an appeal to
one of the masculine umpires, the result of which went
against the fair batswoman. She immediately declared
her engagement to marry the conscientious referee off.
A highly amused throng watched the subsequent specta-
cle of a desperate woman, with her relenting lover in hot
pursuit, quitting the scene of the cruel rupture.

J. J. Calvert, clerk of N.S.W. Leg. Council, is
one of Sydney Cricket Ground’s institutions. At every
important match he spends an afternoon flitting from
one group of girls to another, under the beaming eyes of
his better-half. Mr. Calvert apparently knows the whole
of the ladies’ reserve, and is of the opinion that it is his
duty to instruct youth and beauty as to the intricacies of
the game of cricket. The old gentleman is particularly
busy when a record has been broken, or when an umpire
has given a doubtful decision. What many a damsel
thinks she knows of the noble game is owing to the genial
Calvert. He is so in his element in the ladies’ pavilion
that what life would be to him if it were all Leg. Council
and no “ leg-before ” is an awful thing to contemplate.

Victorian cricketer Armstrong’s 168 (not out)
against N.S.W. recently is the highest ever piled by a
Victorian batsman against N.S.W. during the 77 matches
between the States. “ Billy ” Murdoch’s 321 (in 1882) is
the best tally for a N.S.W. player against Victoria State,
and Noble, Moses, Trumper and P. S. McDonnell (for
N.S.W.) have each exceeded 200 runs in this series of
matches.

South Australian bowler A. Wright’s six
wickets for 209 runs against N.S.W. is reminiscent of
George Giffen’s efforts for the Wheat State, only finer.
The N.S.W. batting strength is better than in the years
when Giffen plugged drearily at each end in the search
for fame. Wright is the most promising bowler S.A. has
turned out for many seasons; but, if no other bowler
comes forward to aid him, the tremendous strain will
soon wear him out.

The French motor car and boat manufacturing
firm of Levavasseur has just completed a motor hydro-
plane for experimental purposes. The plane is a long
tail-like structure which projects from the back of the
boat for a distance of 30ft. When at rest the extremity
of the “ tail ’’ is quite submerged. The advantage of this
construction is that, in rough water, the boat has all the
advantages of an ordinary craft, and when in still water
can travel at a terrific speed as a hydroplane. Up to the
present every type of hydroplane has come to grief in
rough water. So far, no particulars are to hand about
how the new type of craft shaped.

The feature of the Prince Alfred Yacht race on
Port Jackson on Saturday was the struggle between
Scotia (Bmin.) and Ku-Kuburra (12min.) for first place.
The breeze, mostly from the E.N.E., was very light, and
Herreshoff, Cooya, and White Wings could do but little
with it and never had a chance. After chasing Ku-Ku-
burra all round the harbor, Scotia managed to head her
shortly after the Pile-light was rounded on the run for
home. Sunbeam, which was always regarded as a fine
boat in a light wind, performed disappointingly, and was
badly beaten by Culwulla; latter had the same time
allowance, three minutes, but beat her for third place
by seven minutes. The first and second boats were
separated by only seven seconds, after a most exciting
chase.

A big crowd rolled up at the combined show of
the Sydney Flying Squadron and Sailing Club, organised
to raise funds towards the expenses of sending the
18 footer Australian to Westralia. The boa.ts went for
trophies instead of cash prizes, and a good race resulted.
The breeze which came from the E.N.E. had no weight in
it, and the champion boat which started from scratch
had never a show of overhauling the leaders. Zena with
Bmin. start sailed beautifully, and finally beat Aus-
tralian by 31sec. over her handicap. There was practically
nothing else in it but Zena, which went to the front at the
start and stayed there till the finish.

The races for the Sayonara and La Carabine
Cups will prove interesting this year. The La Carabine
Cup contests will be spread over three days, and will start
from a line opposite the St. Kilda (Vic.) pier. The start
for the Sayonara Cup will be from Point Gellibrand.
Rawhiti and Sayonara will both compete for the La Cara-
bine trophy, which is worth 50 guineas, and was pre-
sented by Rupert Clarke. The Sayonara, it will be
remembered, sailed round to Sydney summer before last,
and just managed to beat the Sydney yacht Bona.
Rawhiti has beaten the Bona by six minutes on a wind-
ward course, and the chances are that the much-coveted
Sayonara Cup will be in Sydney by the beginning of next
month. In the struggle for the La Carabine Cup the
Rawhiti will have the assistance of Heather, of the Prince
Alfred Yacht Club, in the attempt to bring the trophy to
Sydney. ,
Quite a large share of Sydney “high society”
denies having been present at Randwick on New Year’s
Day, when ladies consigned to perdition those who
blocked them reaching the scraps of the stand where the
rain did not beat in. Hand-painted dresses were trampled
on and wrenched by those behind, struggling to save
their own costly draperies from the effects of the down-
pour. Men were jabbed with sunshades by furies in rare
and rich costumes, in order to make them get out of the
way, and fashionable ladies wept with rage aDd grief. It
was a fearful scene.

Mr. James Dargin, who died at Windsor on
New Year’s Day, aged 81 years, was a native of that town.
From his boyhood he was connected with the turf, first
as a jockey and then as a trainer. He also raced horses
of his own, and was the winner of two Tattersall’s Cups.
He was one of the founders of the Hawkesbury Race Club.

The first person convicted under Victoria’s new
Gaming Act wasn’t long in arriving—in the person of a
tipster who guaranteed four winners for New Year’s
Day Flemington races. Asked by the P.M. why he
didn’t back his own tips, and so secure affluence, he
naively gave the game away : “Unfortunately, I have
hacked horses, your Worship." He was handed the
minimum penalty of £5 or seven
“Tattersall” disbursed £540,000 in prizes during
1906. Maoriland took 8 firsts, 8 seconds and 8 thirds, and
S. Australia 3 firsts, 3 seconds and 3 thirds.

Figures collected by S.A. Register show that
totalisator investments for 1906 made a slight increase on
the two lean years before, but are still well below 1903
and the dates before that. The State takes 2£ per cent,
(which is apart from the promoting club’s 7J) on the total
of £222,816 ; this makes the Government cheque about
£5570. The unconsidered “ fractions " (below a shilling)
are also put aside, and make a fund for disabled jockeys
and other charities.
“A.G.P.” : In Europe, the bookmaker is fast
becoming extinct, and soon staffed specimens in the
museums will alone be left to remind posterity oi
the folly of their ancestors. The totalisator takes his
place. At the principal race meeting at Hanover (.Ger-
many), the other day, I noticed but one sorry specimen
of the tribe, while the totalisators —there were nearly a
dozen of them—were doing a roaring trade.

The suddenness with which Bent’s Gaming
Act came into force caught most Victorians unprepared.
The Act was signed on December 28th, and on the zJtn
punters who wanted to back dead birds with the local
Ikeys for Saturday afternoon’s Melbourne races (at
Epsom) were met with a bland smile and a placid jno
savee.” Bendigo was almost as Juddyesque. Wrens
Collingwood tote ran as usual; but the presence of half-
a-dozen seasoned constables, each from a different
suburb, stolidly standing outside and recording the names
of such punters as they recognised, got on the nerves, and
business speedily became dull. On Monday all was
changed. The notorious “tote” was thrown open to
all who cared to enter ; the wire entanglements and heavy
wooden barricades were there still, but the masked men
and the tote sheets were replaced by “ Aunt Sallies,
ninepins, and other innocent amusements. This was
partly because a raid had been feared, and partly to bluff
press and police. The press was duly bluffed, the in-
genuous reporters having apparently failed to grasp the
fact that numbers of men would not Visit a yard and stay
half-an-hour or so just for the fun of watching a game of
ninepins. Betting was going on all the while—on trust.
Half-a-dozen of these innocent-looking young men strolled
around casually, and spoke a word or two here and
there with those they knew. A. memo, was made
on a scrap of paper or a shirt cuff, and that
was all. No money or ticket passed, and you
either took Wren’s tote-odds on trust or the S.P. as
reported. As to how settling takes place Heaven knows,
but that difficulty is not insuperable. Other clauses that
came into effect with a sudden jerk were those aimed at
Tatt. sweeps, the most drastic of which is No. 8, which
enacts that “ no person shall for payment or otherwise
forward or receive any packet, parcel, money, cheque,
draft or order for payment of money for the purpose of
the same being forwarded either directly or indirectly to
the promoters or managers of any illegal lottery.” That
clause alone seems comprehensive enough to put an
extinguisher on “ Tatt.” as far as Victoria is concerned ;
but the managers of that institution are said to view the
situation with equanimity, and to be making other
arrangements. # *
The fascinating pastime of two-up was not
illegal in Victoria till Bent’s Anti-Gambling Act made it
so; and yet, according to the Argus, which certainly
ought to know, there were only two big two-up schools
in Melbourne. For years, says the same authority, there
was only one, and then the “uppers” quarrelled,
and a swarm went off and founded another school
of its own. With the coming into force of
the Act both schools put up the shutters. In
Sydney, in spite of Wade’s Act, there are said to
be three or four large schools in full blast. The Argus
interviewed a “ notorious two-upper," who explained
that he was feeling much better now school was
closed. While it was open, he could not keep away, but
found his way there even as the turtle finds the road to
the tureen.

If anything was required to prove the absurdity
of the RugDyites’ claim that their game is the “ national
pastime ” of England, the tour of the S’African team sup-
plied it. No Jess than 13 counties failed to score, and
were beaten by double figures. An All-England team
made a draw of it with three points each, All-Scotland
beat the invaders by s>x to nil, and All-Ireland was beaten
by 15 to 12, the winning score being a very dubious try.
The last match played on British soil was against
Cardiff, and the Taffies simply ran over the
Springboks, beating them by 17 to nil, and this
in face of the fact that Wales had been previously
beaten by 11 to nil. Of the counties Lancashire was the
only one to make anything like an eveh game of it, and
there the Africans won by the narrow margin of three
points, the score being 11 to 8. It is a thousand pities
that none of the outlying portions of the Empire plays
British Association. If a good Association team could
visit the British Isles there would be some famous
struggles, for that is the game the bone and sinew of the
Gold country play. Rugby seems to be the pastime of
gilded johnnies and the other sort of johnny who is not
gilded. # „ ,
Another match has been arranged between
Australian champion ped. A.' B. Postle and Irishman

events are set down for February.

Kalgoorlie Xmas “Hundred” Sports were re-
sponsible for a slashing performance by Irish athlete
B. R. Day, who scooped in the 350 yd. Handicap, from
scratch, in the Australian record of 37 l-ssec. Champion
Postle is also credited with skimming over 100 yd. in
9£sec.—a world’s record. Both records, however, are not
recognisable, since the track is down-hill. It is a pity
that promoter Rufe Naylor doesn’t remedy the fault.

That cycling is still booming in Christchurch
(M L ) is evidenced by the fact that the local Cycle and
Motor Club is about to build an indoor track for night-
racing in the winter months. These tracks are common
enough in Europe and America. In fact, all the cycle
racing in Russia is carried out on indoor tracks, excepting
those which take place between the terrorists and the
myrmidons of the Czar. They take place outside, so as
to <>-ive scope for the throwing of the bombs.

“T.” : Mile-champon swimmer, Dave Billington,
gave an exhibition of fancy work before .the invited big-gun
brigade, at Adelaide last week. The Englishman subse-
quently put up an excellent showing over 500 yards, con-
cedin'* local crack, Moon, 15sec., and defeating him
easily s in 3min. 21sec. This was a better go by 2sec. than
George Read’s previous best, made in the same
water some three years ago. In South Aus. Billington is
bound to have better results than in t’other States, as an
amateur body does not exist, and the local swimmer is
after the coin, and can compete against the imported
man without being blotted out by an over-con-
servative association, consisting mostly of nonen-
tities who yelp in committee, delight in viewing
their names in print, and do their best to block the
progress of the sport. The Melbourne representative
of Billington recently approached some members of the
Victorian Swimming Association, but was received
freezingly, and was informed that, as Dave was a
“professional,” the V.S.A. could not lend any support-
even if he was the first Englishman to make the trip.
From a biz point of view, the V.S.A. should consider the
advisability of engaging Billington to give some exhi-
bition long-distance swims for the benefit of the aspiring
contestant, and at the same time assist in attracting
public attention to the sport that deserves even a Govern-
ment subsidy. The V. A. A. A. has engaged professionals
as a draw at its amateur boxing competitions, and the
New Zealand Boxing A. has a scheme for assisting the game
bv engaging pros, like Keys and Co. Why does not the
V S A. treat swimmin in the same manner and endeavor
to create a boom? Billingtons don’t arrive everyday.
The one-eyed amateur body will not see this opportunity
till it has vanished with Dave’s departure. In Melbourne,
if he decides to come, Billington, on the present outlook,
will strike a considerable ice mound in the local governing
body. Billington was married prior to his departure to
Australia, but his wife did not accompany him. Outside
of a few swims at ports of call on the way out Billington s
training amounted to nil.
When ex-champion Mike Williams awoke from
the insomnia cure induced by Dr. W. Squires, he turned
a broad grin to those about him and demanded confi.
dently “ What about yer champions now? Oi tould yez
Oi’d bate him.” Mike had been dreaming a lovely vision
of himself triumphant, with poor little Willie on the floor
taking his 10 seconds. Which recalls Mike’s experience
after his first defeat at the hands of Bill Smith. Mike was
living at a Melbourne hostelry, where he was the white-
haired bhoy. Only the best was good enough for Mike, and
the landlord treated him asif he wereaplenipotentiary from
the court of Heaven. But when Mike went under before
Smith, he spent the rest of the night with some friends,
and did not turn up at his hotel until after closing time!
Knocking at the door, he saw a window open above him,
and the shaggy head of the landlord emerge. “ Who’s
there ? ” asked the head. “Me ! Moike Williams,” replied
the defeated hero. “ Moike Williams,” repeated the
landlord ; “ Oi doan’t knaw the na-ame,” and the window
closed with a bang. Despite his defeats, Mike is happy
in Australia. He has won something better than cham-
pionships in an attractive Ringwood girl, whom he
married a couple of months back. Like all good immi-
grants, Mike has settled on the land, and will in future
apply himself to putting a head on cabbages instead of
men.

No Vic. representative goes to have a shot for
the English amateur athletic championships. Melbourne

The Abgus effected a big scoop from the Age
in getting in ahead with the announcement of the
Squires world’s championship fight with Jim Jeffries,
and this in spite of the fact that the whole business had
been through the hands of Beckett, of the Age, who sent
the cables for Squires. The Age was holding back, pend-
ing a decisive message, and the preliminary cables fell
into the hands of citizen Wren, who trotted them off to
the Argus, as a peace-offering and an intimation that he
cherished nt> unkind or revengeful sentiments towards
that paper for the unmeasured abuse it has dealt out to
him for months past. Next morning, the Argus
published the information, and the Age came in tamely
a day later with the news of the battle, looking as if it
had lifted the fat item from its bloated contemporary.
The Argus staff is still chuckling, for all’s fair in love and
war correspondence.
* * * *
Another true story of the modesty of William
Squires. One evening, recently, William was racing about
Melbourne in company with the Age man who has con-
ducted the negotiations in connection with the forth-
coming world’s championship battle. The pair were
chasing a cable message from one office to another, when
they bumped three riotous citizens tumbling from a city
pub. One of these was a particularly virulent drunk, and
was howling for battle. He wanted to fight his two com-
panions, then clamored for a contest with any kind man
in the adjective street. At this point the collision occurred,
and the drunk fastened on Squires, apostrophised him in
fearful language insulting to his forebears, and threatened
his demolition on the spot. Squires did not respond in
kind, he simply tore himself from the clutch of the
raging inebriate and fled into the road. He was not con-
tent to walk, he ran, and when the pressman overtook
him the champion said agitatedly : “ Ain’t it shocking 1
A man can’t walk the streets without being in danger of
getting a punch.” #
At present the idea is that Squires will fight
Jeffries at the goldfield town of Rhyolite, in the terri-
tory of Nevada. As a matter of fact, it is mighty doubt-
ful if he will ever meet the boiler-maker in a ring. So
far, there is no word that Jeffries has signed any agree-
ment to fight, but the people who are taking Squires to
America will no doubt arrange that he will meet some of
the best Yankee boxers of his class. Jeffries’ spell on the
farm has done him incalculable harm from a boxers
standpoint, and the hero of so many great victories will
not make a hash of his reputation by getting into the ring
with a man of Squires’ development unless he can enter
it fit and well, and somewhere in the neighborhood of
15st. Anyhow, if they do meet, it will be a cheerful scrap,
worth going a long way to see. Both are rushers, and
both hurl their weight behind their blows, but so far
there is no proof that Jeffries has any particular
skill in in-fighting. He never had a chance to do it, for
hitherto, when his awful wallop, with 2101 b. of hard
meat, bone and muscle behind it, struck the other
fellow, the other fellow just curled up. The man who
misses the first blow will probably be outed in short
order, for when two unscientific rushers meet, things are
generally short and sharp.
The Gaiety Athletic Club has just now a
monopoly of Sydney boxing, but does not seem to be
able to turn it to much advantage. On Saturday night
there was a wild scramble between E. Whiting, of Vic-
toria, and Robert Whitelaw, of Newcastle. _ In the second
round the N.S.W. swung his right like a virago swings a
frying-pan, and it caught the Victorian on the back of
the head, of all places, and sent him on his nose. Later
on the mill grew 7 merrier, and the Victorian went down.
He got up again, and the whirly-whirly ended with both
men on the boards. When they got up, the referee sent
them to their corners, and declared that the N.S.W. man
had won on a foul. That referee has keen eye-sight !

supply me with a room for my sake. She informed me
with pride that they were getting twenty-five new rooms
built, but I said one would be sufficient, as I had only
one wife and two infants. In my room the texts still
spoke of sinners, and were more or less insulting. A
cheap Bible was in every room. The odor of sanctity
was getting on my nerve's, but I read the Bible until i
went to sleep. At breakfast my wife ordered some mint
for the baby, but was informed that baby-milk was an
extra—a luxury—and could not be included in a sixpenn'
feed. My little two-year-old devoured some bread and
soup, and was accordingly fined threepence. At night
the guests complained of cold, but the sausage-haired
lassies declared that a fire was out of the question,
because all the chimneys smoked. An old couple from
S. Australia went to bed at half-past seven because of the
cold. “ I don’t like your Victoria,” said the old fellow,
“ it’s so d—d mean ! ” I hastened to inform him that we
didn’t all work “for His sake.” I requested the chief
lassie to see that some luggage of mine was sent up to my
room. “We have no men to do those things, shesaia,
“but the lef-tenant might oblige you if you ask him.
didn’t ask him, but in the morning I became a left-tenant
myself.

An influential Jap. paper on California’s
anti-Monkey outbreak :
We number about 60,000 in San Francisco. Remember,
there were not nearly 50,000 of us in Oorea, and we did
not hesitate to attack China when she molested our sub-
jects there. If, however, the United States are incapable
of settling the matter, we shall be obliged to solve the
problem by force of arms—to protect our people with our
cannons. We cannot admit that we would tolerate them
being anywhere subjected to a policy of persecution, and
treated like Jews and negroes.
This to Uncle Sam’s 70,000,000 ! And Australia
hasn’t 5,000,000.
Not a great deal of prominence was given
by the Sydney dailies to the recent threatened
strike of South Coast (N.S.W.) dairymen. Between
the landlord on one side, and the agent on the
other, the Ulawarra cow-man has a hard teat to
pull. When, some years ago, the Bega district
was blessed with a good season, the landlords
gaily raised their rents. That was in 1902; but,
although the seasons have varied since then, the
rents have been models of stability.
John Mills, who died at Ashfield (N.S.W.),
the other day, aged 80, was one of the first cotton
growers in N.S.W. When the American Civil
War “skied” the price of the commodity, Mills
was one of the few who accepted the Govern-
ment’s offer of cotton-seed for cultivation. He
raised a crop at Ashfield, and won several prizes
for quality. He was a compositor by trade, and
“snatched type” for 20 years in S.M. Herald
office.
“ Shickerer ” writes indignantly re Bul-
letin par as to drunks on trams :
So you’d put the shickerers who get on the tram “in a
hutch with some straw in it ” ? Wu’dver ? And who'd do
the putting, eh ? You and yer hatch ot glorified quill-
directors, eh ? Nice charnce you’d have of putting ME in
“ a hutch with some straw in it.” I reckon as how I’d
have a bit to say in the putting, and I reckon that I
wouldn’t be the juggins to be flopped on ther straw.
I serpose yer reckon that to put drunks in a dog-box is
dead funny, eh ?
Ef you ever had a cargo of colonial ale on board after a
twenty-first birthday? No ! I serpose you’d s y, “It’s so
degrading,” like old Jugful, eh? I can see you’re one of
the “ I’ll-have-a-lemonade-and-raspberry-vinegar” crowd.
Nice charnce you’d have of putting me “in a hutch
with some straw in it.”
I’ll tell yer what, there’s only two shrewdies in Thb
Bulletin factory—that’s the bloke what calls hisself
“ Austra ” anti the drawer of “ Hops.” They’re the only
two shrewdies ; they know the strength of a pint or more.
Decent chaps, I call ’em, but as fer the cove who wrote
“ Put the drunks in a hutch with some straw in it,” well,
by—by—by—words fail me, but if I could meet him, he’d
have to make lively preparations for 45 3-5 seconds of
plain, unadulterated beery bill from yours in liquor.

CONQUERS INDIGESTION
and overcomes all Stomach Ailments.
ALMOST A MIRACLE—STOfIACH WASHED OUT WITH A TUBE DAILY.
Mr. Samuel James Miles, of Bedfern, for over ten years in the Bail way
Service, sends the following, and confirms the same on oath :—
“ Messrs. FISHER and CO.
“Sirs, —I suffered for months with Acute Dyspepsia; terrible burning
pains and swellings in the stomach, accompanied with constant vomiting, made
life hideous.
“ The pain in the stomach was so acute that it doubled me in two. There
was no relief in any position, and I would walk the floor at night praying for
death to end my sufferings ; people living in the house can testify to the truth
of my statement, and the reality of my agony.
‘ ‘ I was treated by Dr. and Dr. , and took all kinds of medicine,
and had my stomach washed out daily with a tube.
“ At last I became a patient in Prince Alfred Hospital for four months, and
after leaving was sent to Rookwood instead of Camden Convalescent Home.
This was so that I might have constant medical attendance, my condition being
so serious and critical. I stayed at Rookwood for two months, and left terribly
emaciated, a complete wreck. The doctor told me my heart was affected, and
altogether out of order through Dyspepsia. Any exertion, even walking a short
distance, would cause me to pant for breath, and sink down from sheer
exhaustion. I was seldom without pains in the back and head.
“ About this time a friend, Fred. , advised me to take Fisher’s Phos-
pherine, but I had taken so much medicine prescribed, and also patent medicines,
I said to myself, ‘ What good can Fisher’s Phospherine dome?’ But each time
Fred. saw me, he kept on saying, ‘ Why don’t you try Fisher’s
Phospherine ? ’
“At last I bought a bottle, and after two days I felt greatly relieved, and
much better. I gradually regained strength, and in about a month all pain had
gone from the stomach, back, and head. I felt a new man.
“ Dr. met me after I had commenced to take Fisher’s Phospherine,
and he said, ‘ Why, Miles, you are getting better; you are a marvel; my
medicine is doing you good.’
“ I replied, ‘ Yes, doctor, the part of it I had not taken.’
“I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to
be true. “SAMUEL JAMES MILES.”

IMPORTING
A HORRIBLE DISEASE.
AUSTRALIA’S INTERNAL PERIL.
The Free-Trade Mania
The Proposal to introduce a new and most
virulent disease into Australia to exterminate
Rabbits does not now appear nearly so likely to
prove successful as was at first anticipated. Only
very recently, in fact, within the past three weeks,
reports have come to hand of numbers of draught
cattle dying from a disease called Hemorrhagic
Septicaemia, a form of Blood Poisoning which is
said to be the same as the disease with which, at
the instance of a few large landholders, experi-
ments are now being conducted on Broughton
Island, just off the coast of New South Wales,
with a view of exterminating Rabbits, which, like
other imported pests, may cost Australia hundreds
of thousands of pounds, to say nothing of Human
Life. The Australian Climate, ranging as it does
from Tropical to Temperate, would, without a
doubt, aid the dissemination of this horrible
disease, which is said to be closely allied to the
most loathsome malady known to mankind. This
is the disease which interested squatters wish
to introduce to Australia, and plead in de-
fence that it is harmless to all but Rabbits,
Australia has surely imported enough pests already
(for instance, the Scotch Thistle, Lantana, Prickly
Pear, Sparrows, Starlings, Foxes, Rabbits, &c.),
to make it proof against a fresh outbreak of the
“ Importing Mania. ’’ Our magnificent land, when
white men first took possession, was singularly
free from all noxious plants and pests. We have
to thank the Freetrade importers for the majority
of our present day disadvantages. When Aus-
tralia gives up importing and manufactures locally
the £63,000,000 worth of goods imported annually,
we will have very few men walking about looking
for work ; instead, the land will be cut up into
small holdings, which they will profitably work.
The ambition of every true Australian should be
to make our splendid country self supporting and
filled with prosperous, healthy people.
Rabbits during the past few years have become
of immense commercial value, and instead of being
a curse have become a blessing to many thousands
of men throughout Australia who directly or
indirectly derive their living from the rabbit
trapping industry. Some millions of rabbits were
last year exported to England, and the fur from
a few millions more was converted into hats, &c.,
in Australian mills ; this is without taking into
consideration the number consumed locally. If
the proposal to induce a loathsome disease is
carried out, who can say that the result will not
be mbst disastrous? The only efficient rabbit
exterminator is closer settlement. By this agency
alone will the problem be solved, We Australians
must give up the importing mania and learn to
hustle for ourselves. The; foreign traitor has
already too tight a grip upon our country. Are
we the inferiors of European and Asiatic Nations
that we cannot produce our own requirements?
God helps those who help themselves. We need
a large manufacturing population to consume the
products of our land. Instead of the farmer
having to hump his products thousands of miles
(with consequent heavy freight charges) be wants
a market at his own door. To accomplish this
we must have protection, nay almost prohibition ;
and protection not only for the manufacturer, but
for the worker also. Australia needs men, and
protection and closer settlement are the only
means to this end—men will come where there is
work for them, good wages and land to work on.
In Australia’s coming struggle for national exist-
ence all available men will be needed to help
defend the country.
STRONG, HEALTHY MEN, FREE FROM
DISEASE AND EVERY PHYSICAL DE-
FECT. IT IS, UNFORTUNATELY, A FACT
THAT IT IS NOW NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND ANYONE QUITE HEALTHY—
QUITE SOUND—AND QUITE FREE FROM
DISEASE. IN AUSTRALIA’S COMING
STRUGGLE FOR NATIONAL EXISTENCE,
THE ENORMOUS ARMY OF CHRONIC
SUFFERERS FROM ASTHMA, CATARRH,
HYDATIDS, CONSUMPTION, TUMORS,
EPILEPTIC FITS, &c., &c., WILL BE A
SERIOUS DRAWBACK TO THE ABILITY
OF AUSTRALIA TO DEFEND ITSELF.
AS RECENT STATISTICS PUBLISHED IN
AUSTRALIA SHOW, WE HAVE AT PRE-
SENT A GREATER ARMY OF “SUPPOSED-
TO-BE INCURABLE CHRONICS” THAN
OF REAL DEFENDERS IN A MILITARY
OR NAVAL SENSE. THIS OUGHT NOT
TO BE, AND, WHAT IS MORE TO THE
POINT, IT CAN BE VITALLY REMEDIED
BY RETURNING TO NATURE’S OWN
METHOD OF CURE ; IN OTHER WORDS,
“ BACK TO NATURE.”
On this account most especial attention is
directed to the fact that there are innumerable
cases of deeply-seated, obscure, intractable, and
supposed-to-be incurable diseases, which baffle
the whole medical world, and yet such cases are
now being readily cured in a permanent manner
by the new and riglit-ahead-of-date methods of
Mr. H. E. Kugelmann, the famous consulting
herbal practitioner and gifted diagnostician, of
14-16 Queen-street, Melbourne; Sydney, Ade-
laide, and Brisbane. A confidential consultation
with him will convince any sufferer that he com-
pletely understands the deeply-seated causes of
disease, and, what is still of more importance, he
knows how to cure it. AS MR. KUGELMANN
MAY BE CONSULTED IN SYDNEY, etc., AS PER
SCHEDULE HEREUNDER, chronic sufferers
ought to avail themselves of the opportunity
to obtain his exceptionally skilful advice and
treatment. He possesses the gift of intuitive
diagnosis, and can tell patients what is the cause
of their disease without being informed in any
way by them, and will give a straight-out opinion
as to whether the case is curable or not. If pre-
ferred, a legal agreement is entered into for a
complete cure for a lump sum in each instance.
All Consultations are charged a Fee of
10s., and after obtaining his diagnosis, patients
oan have treatment or not, as they please. It
Mr. Kugelmann considers the case incurable, the
fee charged will be returned. If unable to
Consult him personally, write full de-
scription of your case, and enclose Postal-
note or Stamps for 10s. Fee, and address
it to him to his Head Offices, 14-16 Queen-street,
Melbourne, on receipt of which diagnosis will be
sent at earliest possible moment. Unless tee is
enclosed, no diagnosis will be sent in reply.
It is safe to say that there is not a single city,
town, or hamlet in all Australasia in which is not
to be found some erstwhile hopeless sufferer whom
he has cured. It is high time that the entire
community clearly understood that the present
craze for operations for almost any internal and
external ailment is unnecessary, for by Mr.
Kugelmann’s system all internal displacements,
whether of the Kidney or of any other organs,
can be completely cured without operations, ana
that all Tumors, Cysts, Polypi, and other growths,
internal and external, can by this method be
dissolved painlessly, and cured without cutting or
operating. ,
It is of little use acting the part of the stupid
ostrich and refusing to look at facts as they are.
The evidence which Mr. Kugelmann lias pro-
duced, and the vast army of chronics which he has
cured during the past 38 years, is simply un-
paralleled, and the cures accomplished by him
unsurpassed in modern history.
All ohronic sufferers who have so far neglected
to consult Mr. Kugelmann should not fail to avail
themselves of this opportunity to obtain his
exceptionally skilful advice and treatment.
Mr. Kugelmann may be consulted as per
following Schedule, viz.
SYDNEY, N.S.W.— At his Sydney offices, 199
Olarence-street, between King and Market Streets, first
floor, upstairs, on the following dates, viz.
MONDAY, 14th JANUARY, 1907, Daily, until SATUR-
DAY MORNING, 19th JANUARY, 1907.
GRAFTON, N.S.W. (Clarence River).— At
“ Commercial ” Hotel, on—
FRIDAY. 22nd FEBRUARY, 1907, until MONDAY,
25th FEBRUARY, 1907. And about every 16th
week thereafter.
LISMORE (Richmond River), N.S.W.— At Mr.
Kugelmann’s branch offices, in the new firm’s chambers,
over Nesbitt, McMaster’s Store, Molesworth-street, on—
WEDNESDAY, 27th FEBRUARY, 1907, until SATUR-
DAY, 2nd MARCH, 1907. And about every 16th
week thereafter.
BRISBANE, Q.— At his permanent branch offices
(top floor, King, Oribb and King’s-buildings), 77-79-81
Queen-street, opposite Town Hall, Brisbane, from—
SATURDAY, 9th FEBRUARY, 1907, Daily, until
THURSDAY, 14th FEBRUARY, 1907. And
about every sixteen weeks thereafter.
It has been found that in giving evidence it is
necessary for the deponent to swear to the truth
of his assertions, such oath rendering him liable to
imprisonment if false. Now, this is exactly what
has been done by those many thousands of persons
cured by Mr. Kugelmann of every supposed-to-be-
incurable disease on earth ; they have sworn to
the truth of the statements they have made, so
that all may know that they are true. The fol-
lowing are only a few out of many thousands of
testimonials received by Mr. Kugelmann from
grateful patients whom he has cured
Five Years’ Tumor Cured. Doctors failed.
EVIDENCE of MISS FLORENCE M. GLENN.—Sworn
at Sydney, December 1899.—I reside at Summer Hill,
Sydney, i consulted Mr. Kugelmann, at the end of Febru-
ary, 1888. Before that I had been ill for some time, and
had a growth on my face. I was ill five years before any-
thing was done with it. I went to see a doctor in
Liverpool-street, but he did me no good. The doctor
performed an operation by cutting it out. Six months
afterwards it commenced to grow again. He proposed
to operate again, but I would not accede to it. I was not
well while it was growing again. I was in a bad state of
health generally. I went every other day to the doctor ;
but, finding that I was not getting any better, I con-
sulted Mr. Kugelmann by letter. I received a reply from
him, telling me what to do. I went to his office in
Sydney, and got the Herbal Medicines, which he pre-
scribed. The result was I got better in no time, and the
Tumour was gradually dissolved, and has not since
returned. Since then I have felt splendid. I commenced
taking his medicine in February, and was completely
cured by August.
Eighteen Years’ Bleeding Tumor cured.
Seven Operations Failed.
Riverton, South Australia, 19th February, 1904.
Mr. H. E. Kugelmann, Consulting Herbal Practitioner.
Dear Sir,—I began to suffer about 18 years ago with
internal hemorrhage in a very severe form. I consulted
a doctor at Riverton, who said I was suffering from severe
internal troubles. After treating me for some time, he
sent me to the North Adelaide Private Hospital,
where I was attended to by one of the leading-
doctors in Adelaide. The Adelaide doctor said that I had
no internal tumor at this time. I went home to Riverton,
and kept getting weaker, and the bleeding again came on. I
then went to Adelaide again to a celebrated doctor of
that city, who said that I had an internal growth,
and it must be operated on. That was 12 months
after I first became ill, and I went under no less than
three operations at this period. I lost enormous quantities
of blood ; in fact, the wonder was that I did not bleed to
death. I went under no less than four operations during
the ensuing 12 months, but the bleeding kept on inter-
mittently, draining my life away. Altogether 1 under-
went seven operations at the hands of the doctors.
It was at this stage that I heard of your treat-
ment ; my eldest daughter drew my attention to
one of your books. I was much impressed with
the number of remarkable cures you had effected
of cases that seemed even worse than my own ;
therefore, as soon as I could, I consulted you in
Adelaide. And on receiving an assurance that
you could effect a complete cure without operating,
I commenced your treatment, the result of which was
that I soon began to improve, and, although the bleeding
did not leave me at once, it gradually lessened, and after
some time completely ceased. So many years have
elapsed, and I still remain in the best of health, I feel
sure that I am justified in stating that a lasting cure has
been effected, and I consider it only right, for the benefit
of humanity, that a treatment like this, which can effect
a cure of internal growths, tumors, etc., without opera-
tions, should be widely known. I am, therefore, desirous
of having these facts published amongst your numerous
testimonials.

Hereditary, Fifteen Years’ Chronic
Catarrh Cured.
Doctors Failed.
As long as I can remember I have been a sufferer. Even
as a little child I was an invalid, and my mother was very
doubtful if she would be able to rear me. I generally
suffered from a cough and headache. The doctors could
not find out what was the matter with me. Each year as
I grew older I became worse. I was fearfully wasted and
thin owing to constant coughing. My head was never
free’from pain. I was taken to the Sydney Hospital,
where I remained for some time. I suffered continually
from inveterate nasal catarrh. My father suffered in the
same way as I was afflicted, and my giandfathei before
him. I began to believe that my case was incurable,
because he editary, and that only death would relieve
me of my troubles. Altogether, I consulted a number of
medical men of known repute, with the result that their
treatment only left me in a worse and more weakened
condition. At this stage I had the rare good luck to hear
of Mr. Kugelmann, and to obtain his treatment for
my case. After I had been treated by him for
a short time I was enabled to sleep at night—a
blessing which had been denied me for years. His treat-
ment; caused a catarrhal abscess to break in the head,
with the result that the relief was wonderful. The run-
ning from the nose vanished, and the constant headache,
which I had all my lifetime, disappeared. I became
bright and cheerful, and put on flesh rapidly, gaining
over a stone in weight, and have been completely cured
for three years. I should be very glad to see this pub-
lished for general information. ,

Chronic Catarrh, Dyspepsia and Internal
Troubles Cured.
Corindhap, via Ballarat, 8/6/1902.
Mr. H. E. Kugelmann.
Dear Sir, —I suffered from Nasal Catarrh, Dyspepsia,
and Internal Troubles for some years. I consulted three
or four doctors, but failed to derive any benefit from
their treatment. At last I was persuaded to consult you.
You told me exactly what was the matter with me, and
that you could cure me. Thanks to your treatment, I
can now say that I am perfectly cured.

“ Incurable ” Consumption Cured.
Broughton Village, New South Wales,
15th August, 1906.
Mr. H. E. Kugelmann, Consulting Herbal Practitioner,
Melbourne, Victoria.
Dear Sir,—For many years I suffered with that dreadful
complaint; Consumption. When about seven years old,
I contracted a very severe cold on my lungs, which
left a terrible cough on me. I tried many remedies,
which did me little or no good. As years went by,
I all the time kept getting worse. I used to perspire
frequently in my sleep. When I first went to visit you
in Kiama I was so weak I could hardly walk upstairs
to your consulting room. As soon as you saw me you
told me that I was suffering with Chronic Consumption
of the lungs, and that you could cure me if I carried
out your directions. After taking your medicine for some
time, I began to feel a little better, and I now can testify
that I am completely cured. I may safely assume it to
be a permanent cure, as I have not taken any of your
medicine for over four years, and I keep perfectly well.
Many thanks to you for your skilful treatment.—I am,
dear sir, yours very gratefully,

Chronic Locomotor Ataxia Cured.
Doctors Failed.
I had a numbed feeling at base of brain, and pain and
numbed feeling down the spine and in the legs, The
pains were at one time constant for three months. I
tried one doctor after another, and gradually got worse
the whole time. I also tried the Prince Alfred Hospital;
no good. Finally, I lost all use of my legs, and fell in
the street, and had to be carried home. A medical man
whom we sent for at this time pronounced it useless to
treat me, as I was quite incurable. Hearing, however,
of a case of Paralysis which Mr. Kugelmann had cured
at Goulburn, I decided to try his treatment. It took
three men to carry me to his consulting room from the
cab. I stuck to'his treatment, and after some months’
steady treatment began to improve, and finally got quite
cured, and have been perfectly well ever since, having
regained complete use of my once-useless legs and body.

Six Years’ Paralysis, Spinal Complaint,
Epileptic Fits, Catarrh, Internal
Maladies Cured — Thirteen Doctors
Failed.
I suffered terribly for over six years from a complica-
tion of organic diseases. My troubles began with
Typhoid Fever, complicated with internal troubles,
resulting in a three months’ illness, during which I
became completely paralysed in all my limbs, arid was
quite lifeless, the spine being mostly affected, also the
base of the brain, resulting in Epileptic Fits. I also
suffered from Stone in the Bladder, Catarrh, and
Eczema, and altogether I endured a martyrdom of pain
and agony day and night, in spite of medical treatment
of every kind. I tried the treatment of 13 doctors, but
not one of them ever benefited me in the least.
Several doctors wished to operate, but were afraid of
my heart. Being advised to consult you, I did so on one
of your visits to Goulburn, and, although I was utterly
disheartened by the fact that 13 doctors had given me up
to die, yet I believed you when you said that I could be
cured bv you ; and so I was, for I began slowly to improve.
The pains left me by degrees, and gradually the feeling
and life came back to my paralysed limbs. I got com-
pletely cured of all my numerous ailments, including the
Displacement, Stone in the Bladder, Epileptic Fits,
Catarrh, &e., and all who know of my case consider the
result only as a miracle. (Signed) Mrs. J. WARE.

Five Years’ Kidney, Heart, Liver
Disease Cured.
Doctors Failed.
Evidence of Mr. Robert Broomfield, Bensley, Grazier,
Crookwell, New South Wales.
Sworn at Sydney, December, 1899.
I fell ill about five years ago with a severe attack of
influenza, which left me in a very weak and delicate
condition, suffering from loss of appetite and pains round
the heart. These symptoms continued for about four or
five months. I then consulted a doctor at Crookwell, and
was under his treatment for about four months. I took
his medicines three times a day, but got no relief from
them. I tried a change of air to Cootamundra, without
result. I also tried patent medicines of various kinds,
which failed to benefit me. I then consulted a Doctor at
Goulburn, and then one in Sydney, who gave me medi-
cine for 11 months which did me no good, and I got
worse. The pains about the kidneys becoming more
severe, and my general health breaking up, and leaving
me in a weak and low condition, losing weight daily.
At this stage I decided to consult Mr. Kugelmann at
Goulburn, where he was practising. He examined me,
and told me exactly what I was suffering from, which
quite agreed with how I felt ; and owing to the way he
explained matters to me, I had perfect confidence in his
ability, and began his treatment, consisting of herbal
preparations. I soon got better, improved in a week or
two, the improvement continuing gradually, and I lost
the pains and all symptoms which had previously
troubled me. I now feel quite well and sound in health,
and consider myself perfectly' cured.
Sunstroke, Enlargement of Liver Cured.
Doctors Failed.
Evidence of Mr. John Faulks, Grazier, Berry, New
South Wales. Sworn at Sydney, December, 1899.
I remember consulting' Mr. Kugelmann about three
years ago, before which I had been very ill. I had pains
from the soles of my feet to the crown of my head, which
were very bad. For twelve months before I had been
under a doctor in Kiama, but his treatment did me no
good. In fact, I think he was killing me. His medicine
was continually making me worse, so I thought the less I
took of it the better. I suffered from constant and
severe headaches ; which were supposed to have been
brought on by sunstroke. I could hardly express the
feelings which I experienced. 1 was so bad, and my liver
became very much enlarged. 1, therefore, consulted Mr.
Kugelmann, and he told me all my symptoms without
me telling him an\ thing, and told me he could cure me
thoroughly if I would take his herbal medicines, and
follow' out his instructions. I agreed to do this, and paid
him a lump sum down for the whole treatment. I am
very glad I did so, as time has proved that he has done
wonders for me. Before taking his treatment I could not
breathe freely without great pain and distress. His medi-
cines soon took these feelings away. Finally, he com-
pletely cured me, and I have remained well ever since.
Twenty Years’ Asthma and Heart
Disease Cured. Aged 74.
Doctors Failed.
I had chronic asthma for 20 years, severe coughing,
the phlegm almost choking me at times; also, I was
dangerously ill, apart from the asthma, suffering from
a complication of disorders. I could scarcely breathe
at times, and was as one dead. My heart was badly'
affected, and also my liver and stomach, eventually
ending in dropsy of the feet and legs. During the many
years of my illness I tried a number of the best doctors,
both in Melbourne and Sydney. They did me no good
whatever. I also tried all kinds of patent medicines,
without result. I had at last become so bad that I felt my
end had come ; my' friends were telegraphed for, and
another doctor summoned. I, however, had had enough
of doctors, and tried Mr. Kugelmann instead, and his
treatment had a most marvellous effect on me. I at
once began to feel better. The Asthma disappeared,
appetite returned, and I could once more sleep like a
child. Formerly I could not walk a step without
panting. New I can run up and down stairs like I
could when a young girl. My age is 74.

“ Incurable ” Asthma Cured.
Thirteen Doctors Failed.
Thirty years I suffered frtfta Asthma of the very worst
form. I resided in Sydney when it first cahie on. Doctors
failed to do me any good whatever. I then went to an
inland climate—viz., to Orange, N.S.W., a most healthy
climate. I continued to get worse and worse. Six
doctors treated me at Orange ; two of them at one time
gave me only ten minutes to live. The Rev. John Clifton
ministered to me in what everymne supposed were my
last moments. In all, 18 doctors treated me without
success. After suffering more than mortal man can tell
for over 30 years, I tried your treatment last year,
and I feel now thirty years a. younger man. I can give
the names of all the doctors if required.

IT’S Hairy body carries botb disease

about, now crawling over refuse, now
over the food of the table, flying from the lips of the sicK to
the lips of the healthy, it is said to be more dangerous to
modern society than were the wild beasts to primitive man.
The high mortality among children in the congested
districts of a city, where families are closely crowded together,
where refuse accumulates fast, where food is often Kept in
living rooms, is due to a large degree, so scientists now say, to
the fly. Infant diseases chiefly prevail in summer, when the

WHAT IS CATARRH?
©
Catarrh is inflammation of
the lining membrane of the
nose and adjoining passages.
If this inflammation is not
arrested it invades the pas-
sages which lead from the
nose to the head, ears, throat
and lungs. It injures the
sight and hearing, destroys
i he sense of taste and smell,
renders the breath offensive,
breaks down the affected tis-
sues,'consumes the nasal car-
tileges, and rots away the
small frontal bones of the
skull. The discharge,passing
through the lungs and sto-
mach, causes dyspepsia, also
consumption. Do you want
relief and cure? If so, try
our great remedy.

“Limpy”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ T IMPY ” came to us in the night after
I i a fierce summer day. That day, I
remember, Dad took me for a “ stroll ”
round the boundary fences. Dad carried a bunchy
gum-bough and hardly spoke to me once ; which
was unusual for Dad, because he liked talking to
us boys. I noticed he “clicked”old “Spot,” the
“ generally-useful ” horse away towards home, and
surprised “Pinky,” the cow, by throwing a clod
at her and her calf, and sending them in. Also,
he stopped often and sniffed, as if he were tasting
the air with his nostrils.
It was dark when we got home ; and as we
came up the path to the house the door opened,
and Mother stood there, silhouetted against the
candle-light, the baby in her arms, and Sim
clinging to her skirts. Dad and Mother looked
at each other for a moment; then Mother said :
“Well?”
“ Were all right,” Dad said. “The change in
wind saved us. But Hemstead’s” And he
shook his head.
lc was just after that that we heard a horse
galloping, and Dad and Mother ran to the door,
while Sim and I seized the chance to heap some
more jam on our bread. Then a horse pulled up,
and Dad sang out: “ What is it, Tom ? ”
The man wiped his face with his slouch hat,
and leaned down to tell Dad something. I
couldn’t hear what he said, but I recognised him.
It was Flash Tom Flinders. We boys didn’t like
Flash Tom, because he used to chase us on
horseback with his whip, pretending he was
yarding cattle. As Tom galloped away, Dad
called me to help him pflt Spot in the spring cart.
I never knew before how quickly a horse could be
harnessed.
When I went inside, Mother was bustling
about making up a “shake-down” in the front-
room. After that she tore up some calico into
bandages, set the fountain boiling, and the tea-
pot ready; got the salad-oil bottle out of the
cupboard, and put it handy on the dresser.
Between whiles she went to the door and listened.
Then she sent Sim and me to bed, “to be out of
the way,” and sat down to nurse baby.
I don’t know how long after that it was, but
Sim was asleep, and I was dozing, when a cart
drove up to the door. I slipped on my trousers,
and went out. Dad was helping some people out
of the cart, and mother kept on saying, “You
poor dears; come straight in.” I saw Mrs.
Hemstead and her little baby, and young Florrie
and Ted Hemjstead. Mother took them inside, and
then 1 saw Mr, Hemstead and a strange man,
who looked like a swaggie. Then I saw Flash
Tom sitting On his horse, with his hat on the side
of his head, and holding something in his arms.
Mr. Hemstead and the swaggie had their hands
and arms bandaged. Dad had to help them
inside. Then Flash Tom got down, and we went
m too.
Mrs. Hemstead and the children were in
mother’s room, and I heard crockery rattling.
Then Mother came into the kitchen, and fixed up
the men’s burnt arms with bandages and oil;
and while she was doing that Flash Tom said to
me, “Fetch us some o’ that oil, young ’un.”
L saw then what Tom was carrying. It was a
black retriever puppy, whose paws and muzzle
were all burnt. Tom soaked strips of calico in
0.1, and bound up the whimpering puppy’s hurts.
Somehow, I liked Flash Tom better, after that.
Then Tom rode off home, and Hemstead went
in to his family. Mother made the swaggie a
“ shake r down ” in the back room, and he slept
there with the puppy coiled up beside him. Dad
and Mother and baby slept on the “ shake-down ”
in the front room.
Next day I heard all about it: how the Hem-
steads had been “burnt-out”; how the swaggie
c one up to help them fight the fire, with his dog
at his heels ; how the men were burnt badly, and
how the dog wouldn’t keep away from the
swaggie, and got burnt too. I don’t remember
how long the Hemsteads stooped at our place, or
how long it was before the swaggie’s hands were
well. But I do remember that one morning the
swaggie went away, with a new swag and billy
that Dad gave him.
We all stood out in the yard. The swaggie
thanked Mother and Dad, and shook hands with
tnem; and the Hemsteads thanked him, and
shook hands with him ; then he swung his swag
upon his back and walked off a few paces, with
the puppy limping at his heels. Then th 9 man
put down his swag, picked up the dog, came back
and placed him at Mother’s feet.
“Look, missus,” he said, “I’ll give you the
dorg. He likes you. An’, anyhow, he’ll be
better off with you than trampin’ with me. So-
lon g, old chap.”
He picked up his swag, as if he were in a great
hurry, and walked quickly off. When he got to
the turn of the road he stopped and looked back,
and Mother held up the dog in her arms, and th«
dog cried and struggled; and the swaggie waved
his hand and vanished round the turn.
That’s how “Limpy” came to us.
* * * «
Limpy grew up strong, and helped to bring in
the cows, chased swallows across the paddocks,
and went ’possuming with Sim and me and
the neighbors’ boys. Then one day mother said
some of her fowls were missing ; and dad said we
must have a watch-dog. So Limpy was tethered
with_ a heavy trace-chain—because there was
nothing lighter handy—near the fowl-house,
and mother and Sim fed him. The “baby”
grew up, and other babies took the cradle
in turn and grew up too. And then (how it came
about I never understood) we had to leave the
selection; so we moved into town, where Dad
had got a job. Mother and Dad cried a lot as we
followed the hired team down the track, and even
I felt a pain in the throat when I looked back from
the turn.
* * « * i
In town, Dad worked wherever he could get
work ; Sim and I were bound to trades, and the
children went to school. After a while, Mother
got some more fowls, and Limpy guarded them
as of old ; and, as of old, Mother and Sim fed
him, and daily he grew more savage.
And then, on a fell day, Sim must go away to
the war. He went to Sydney to be “ passed in,”
and in a few' days came back in his uniform. He
stayed at home for a few days, and then said
good-bye to us. While Mother and Dad and
the others were crying inside, Sim went out to
say good-bye to Limpy. He seemed to take a
long time to do it.
When Sim turned to go, Limpy crouched,
whining and fawning, and Sim went back. Then
Limpy laid his head on Sim’s knee for a moment,
and licked his boots. After that, Sim walked
away quickly, just like the swaggie did many
years ago. Sim marched with hundreds of others
down to the Quay; and the bands played, and
the people cheered ; and women stuck flowers in
the soldiers’ rifle muzzles ; and prominent citizens
made great speeches, and the harbor steamers’
whistles yelled. But, looking back now, I think
that the best tribute Sim carried away to his alien
grave was the lick of the dog.
Often, after I had gone to bed, I heard Dad
and Mother talking beside the kitchen fire about
the old days and the selection. They seemed
kinder to each other, too, though I had never
known an angry word between them. And I
often noticed Limpy sitting erect on his haunches,
looking down the road by which Sim used to come
home.
One day I met Mother coming from Limpy’s
kennel. For the first time it came to me that her
hair was grey, that she wasn’t tall now like she
was when I knew her first, and that she always
walked slowly. She laid her hand on my arm,
and said, gently:
“ See, boy; you ought to shoot Limpy.”
“ Shoot Limpy! Shoot Limpy, Mother!
Why ? ”
“ Ah, boy; the poor brute is so old and tooth-
less and helpless. He’s dying of age and
starvation.”
“ Well, why doesn’t Dad shoot him ? ” I said.
“ Father won’t.” Mother’s voice was trembling.
But young Jack Harris volunteered to do it.
Jack was a militiaman, and a marksman. The
afternoon of the shooting, Dad had to go away by
train, and swallowed his dinner, and hurried off,
though he had two good hours to spare. I had
business in town myself, too.
The day was greying when I got back, and met
Harris.
“Got him off, all right. Up there on the hill.
Pinked him fair between the eyes.”
“Oh!” I said, and hurried on. In the yard,
young Sim was sitting with his chin in his hands,
on a log, at the woodheap. A pick and shovel
lay at his feet.
“ What ’re you doing there, Sim ? ” I asked.
“ Waiting for you—to bury old Limp.” Sim
gulped.
“All right, Sim,” I said. “ Come on.”
We found Limpy lying on the hill-top. What
a thin, grey, toothless carcase it was ! 'The chain
was stdl on his neck. It had been a heavy trace
chain, but it did not look like one now. It was
polished bright as silver, and the links, where
they joined, were worn to the thinness of a six-
penny piece.
We put fresh gum boughs in the bottom of the
grave; we placed Limpy upon them with his
grey, fangless old muzzle lying on his extended
paws, that were still scarred, as if he were sleep-
ing ; we covered him with more gum boughs, and
then silently we piled up the fresh earth-patting
it tenderly. You see, we were burying—or, at all
events, I was—other things besides a dog’s body
in that grave. Then we went home in silence.
The house was unlighted when we entered. I
stepped through the gloom into the front room.
Mother was sitting alone over a dull fire. Her
moist eyes met mine as I sat beside her, but
neither spoke. Then, somehow, my arm was
about her neck, and her toil-scarred hand was
patting mine as it lay in her lap. Still, neither
spoke. I knew that she was crying softly there
in the ruby firelight; and I knew that she knew
I was crying there above her —crying over the
inevitable tragedy of the Ageing and Passing of
Things.
After a time her voice came—the mother-voice,
comforting :
“ Never mind, boy; he was only a dog.”
But she didn’t look up. And still her hand
went on patting mine—patting—patting.

P. T. FREEMAN.
Some years ago an American scientist
narrowly escaped being sent to a lunatic asylum
for declaring that several tribes of Indians who
had originally inhabited the Atlantic sea-board
spoke a species of corrupted Welsh. Now an
English antiquarian who has been delving into
the history of Wales finds that in 1169 Madoc of
North Wales, rather than fight his brother for the
possession of the crown, offered to abandon his
claim if he was allowed to fit out a fleet for the
conquest of foreign parts. Madoc sailed westward
with a small squadron. He returned two years
later and reported that he had discovered a new'
and wonderful country, to which he again set out
with 10 more ships and a small army. That was
the last that was heard of Madoc. So it is quite
possible that he had struck the territory visited by
Erie the Red over two hundred years before.
A letter from Singapore :
Singapore, up to now, has had a silver currency,
always rising and falling with the market supplies.
Food, clothes, etc., are all imported. Nothing is pro-
duced here, and, except for spirits, there is no tariff. One
would naturally expect living to be cheap, but as all the
business is in the hands of a few firms, mostly foreign,
the}' rule the supplies and regulate prices. Our
Oocos staff started getting supplies from here, as
being the nearest port, but soon found that it
was a long way too stiff. Now they deal with
Swallow and Ariell, in Melbourne, thus buying goods in
Australia, a protected country, shipping them here, and
from here our own steamer takes them to Cocos. The
saving thus effected is about, 10 per cent., and that is
compared with an absolutely free port. I’d like to tell
George Eeid that, and see if he would have the face to
talk Freetrade after it.
Labor is very cheap, coolies earning 20 or 30 cents
(about 9d.) a day, but it takes about ten coolies to do as
much work as an ordinary white man, and then they slur
the work. A big hotel is being built here at present with
Chinese labor. Thi-y’ve been at it over 12 months now,
Sundays in, and will be another 12 before they finish.
Unless my eye has gone wrong, the front wall is at least
a foot out of plumb, but they built it back at the top to
make up for the bend in the middle. All coolie work is
of the same sort.
Bruce Smith talks about the Japs at great length. They
are the sharpest swindlers going, in this part of the
world, any way. Give me a Chinaman any day before
“ our allies.” A Chinaman is honest, if you watch him
close enough, but all the watching in the world won’t
keep the Jap from stealing. As for Hindus, Bengalese,
and other Indian races, they are here, at any rate, the
dirtiest people alive. The Malays are the best of the lot.
They are clean, and only steal when you’re not watching
them, but they have a nasty habit of running amok, or
mad, and then they are not pleasant to meet, as they all
carry knives and krisses.

During the election campaign the Sydney
Herald published a statement to the effect that
the shipwrecked Chinese on the wrecked Austra-
lian were hustled on to an old coal hulk, and
barbarously treated. After the elections Sydney
Daily Telegraph published a report showing the
Herald’s statement to be a false and malicious
libel on Australia. This is the Telegraph’s
tale:—
The Chinese could not have had better quarters at any
of the hotels here, while if they had been put into board-
ing-houses they would have been infinitely worse off.
They were provided with an ample and well-assorted
supply of food, with a cook specially appointed to attend
tq them. They had only one day on the hulk, and certainly
were better off for quarters than most of the population
in this community.
Up to date the Herald has not apologised for
the cruel wrong it has done its country. Had it
so libelled the shipping company, and not the
Commonwealth, heavy damages would probably
have been incurred.
“Gilrooney”: When the Philosopher
Infallible arrives, he’ll probably discover that the
working of the universe is really governed by an
accumulation—or rather by a continuation—of
rotary or recurrent waves, each dependent on or
resultant from the other. Just consider this
catalogue:—Waves of heat, of wet seasons, of
seismic disturbances, of light, of ether, of sick-
ness, of gambling, of ping-pong, of Bridge, of
immorality, of cake-walk, and of anti-quities,
like Jawge Reid and Joke Hooke. Just now we
are practically inundated by a gigantic wave of
Worrality and Judkinism. I am wondering
■ 'hat the next will be ; but have a vague premoni-
\ m that it will be an enormous billow, bearing
tx ■ trade-mark of Jack Wren in 35 different
pla es. So lam shifting to higher ground.
Fx im The Bulletin’s oldest inhabi-

There is great brushing-up of authorities over the inno-
cent question, “ Where was the first Sydney graveyard ? ”
and many opinions are given. John Macintosh, M.L.C.,
a colonist since the late thirties, favors the site of the
Bank of New South Wales, judging so from an old map
(1802) by Peron. But the ancient colonist is out in his
measurements. Others favor Church Hill. Scarcely
likely, as John Macarthur had a lease, and intended to
build a mansion there ; and he would hardly do that upon
an old graveyard. There is abundant evidence that
Dawes’Point held the first “ bonevard.” When the old
A.S.N. Co. purchased Campbell’s Wharf, Circular Quay,
about 30 years ago, workmen discovered fragments of
what must have been a headstone over a grave. This
relic was brought to light during the demolition of the
wall at the back of the wharf —the wall which I remember
as dividing Campbell’s wharf from Campbell’s orchard
and garden. Before the garden was formed the ground
was an open paddock, and, previous to that time, must
have been used to some extent as a burial place. In Syd-
ney Gazette, February 5, 1804, a proposition was made to
fence in what was then known as “ the cemetery ”—pre-
sumably the one in George-street, on what is now the
Town Hall site—as the pigs were rooting up earth and
graves ; and in 1866, Bonwick says, the pigs were still
rooting.
General Evelyn Wood, in his recently
published autobiography, tells a story of Gen.
Horsford. Horsford believed in military celibacy.
One day a soldier came to him and said he wanted
to get married. Horsford told him to come again
in a year. .At the year’s end the soldier returned
and said lie still desired to be married. The
general consented, remarking that he never
thought there was so much constancy in any man.
As the man left the room he turned his head, and
said, “ Thank you, sir; but it isn’t the same
woman.”


TORTURED BY
ITCHING SCULP
Eczema Broke Out Also on Hands
and Limbs —Suffering Intense-
Doctors Said Too Old to Be
Cured —An Old Soldier of 80
Years Declares:
“CUTICURA TREATMENT
IS A BLESSING”
“At all times and to all people I am
■willing to testify to the merits of Cu-
ticura. It saved me from worse than
the tortures of hades, about the year
1900, with itching on my scalp and
temples, and afterwards it commenced
to break out on my hands. Then it
broke out on my limbs. I was advised
to use salt and water, which I did, to
no effect. I then went to a Surgeon, who
commenced treating me with a wash of
borax. This treatment did me no good,
but rather aggravated the disease. I
then told him I would go and see a phy-
sician in Erie. The reply was that I
could go anywhere, but a case of
eczema like mine could not be cured;
that I was too old (80). I went to an
eminent doctor in the city of Erie and
treated with him for six months, with
like results. I had read of the Cu-
ticura Remedies often. I was strongly
tempted to give them a trial, so I sent
for the Cuticura Soap, Ointment, and
Resolvent and continued taking the
Resolvent until I had taken six bottles,
stopping it to take the Pills. I was now
getting better. I took two baths a day,
and at night I let the lather of the Soap
dry on. I used the Ointment with
great effect after washing in warm
water, to stop the itching at once. I
am now cured.
“The Cuticura treatment is a blessing
and should be used by every one who
has itching of the skin. I can’t say any
more, and thank God that He has given
the world such a curative. Wm. H.
Gray, 3303 Mt. Vernon St., Philadel-
phia, Pa., August 2, 1905.”

“I was almost a total wreck, and
all out of order. If I was not
suffering from terrible pains in my
kidneys I was in agony with my
head. Biliousness and indiges-

scarcely ate sufficient to keep
body and soul together. But
though everything else had
failed, Mother Seigel’s
Syrup restored me to
the splendid health I
now enjoy.”

it is but Nature’s warning that the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER
are not efficiently doing their duty. ;
The Kidneys of the average person filter and extract from the blood about three pints of urine
every day. In this quantity of urine should be dissolved about an ounce of urea, ten to twelve grains
in weight of uric acid, and other animal and mineral matter varying from a third of an ounce to nearly
an ounce. If the kidneys are working freely and healthily, all this solid matter leaves the body dis-
solved in the urine, but, if through weakness or disease, the kidneys are unable to do their work
properly, a quantity of these urinary substances remains in the blood and flows through thp veins con-
taminating the whole system. Then we suffer from some form of uric poisoning such as Rheu-
matism, Gout, Lumbago, Backache, Sciatica, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia,
Gravel, Stone and Bladder Troubles. A simple test to make as to whether the kidneys are
healthy is to place some urine passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass, and let it stand
until next morning. If it is then cloudy, shows a sediment like brickduat, is of an unnatural color, or
has particles floating about in it, the kidneys are weak or diseased, and steps must immediately be
taken to restore their vigor, or Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, or some of the many manifestations of uric
poisoning will result.
The Liver is an automatic chemical laboratory. In the liver various substances are actually
made from the blood. Two or three pounds of bile are thus made by the liver every day. The liver
takes sugar from the blood, converts it into another form, and stores it up so as to be able to again
supply it to the blood as the latter may require enrichment. The liver changes uric acid, which is
insoluble, into urea, which is completely soluble, arid the liver also deals with the blood corpuscles
which have lived their life and are useful no longer. When the liver is inactive or diseased we
suffer from some form of biliary poisoning such as Indigestion, Biliousness, Anaemia,
Jaundice, Sick Headache, General Debility, and Blood Disorders.
So intimate is the relation between the work done by the kidneys and that done by the liver, that
where there is any failure on the part of the kidneys, the liver becomes affected in sympathy and vice
versa. It was the realisation of the importance of this close union of the labor of those vital organs
which resulted in the discovery of the medicine now known throughout the world as
Warner’s Safe Cure.
Certain medical men, knowing what a boon it would be to humanity if some medicine could be found
which would act specifically on both the kidneys and liver, devoted themselves to an exhaustive search
for such a medium, and their devotion was eventually rewarded by their success in compounding a
medieine which possesses the required quality in the fullest degree. Warner’s Safe Cure exhibits a
marvellous healing action in all cases of functional or chronic disease of the kidneys and liver, and
restoring them, as it is able to do, to health ajnd activity, it, of necessity, cures all complaints due to
the retention in the system of urinary and biliary poisons. A vigorous*action of the kidneys and liver
naturally eliminates the poisons, and troubles due to the presence of the poisons cease. Cures effected
by Warner’s Safe Cure are permanent simply because they are natural. [l2]
The Inky Way.
“ Alba ” : Have been speculating in editors lately, and
they made me feel cold and unhappy. I proposed to go
round the world and see things with a bright, fresh eye,
and record the melody of continents as they rushed past
my ear. To editor 1.1 suggested a trip to Valparaiso via
the Newcastle-Shanghai route, where the opium squash
and the blood drinks are drained to the lees. Then on to
Buenos Ayres, after a gorgeous climb over the Chilian
Andes, where the condor floats round the ice peaks. Editor
I. glowed when I pointed out the magnificent chilled meat
copy awaiting in Argentine, the pastoral and mining copy,
the trail of the white emigrant on the rush for land copy,
and the lightning blade articles dealing with Pig and
capital. The editor sat back and re-glowed, and then
offered me £lO for the sole rights of mv articles. He is
still glowing. To editor 11. I proposed a trip through
Manchuria into St. Petersburg. Ho. 2 was a warlike
editor, and I word-painted Lio Yang and Mukden to him
in a way that made him yearn to scissor my breath
and paste it in the next issue. He admitted that the
Japanese officials at Seoul and Port Arthur would give
me a nasty time ; he warned me that the climate be-
tween Harbin and Moscow would freeze the knobs of
Hades. I said it wouldn’t matter if his paper helped me
through. He sat back and offered five pounds ! He also
warned me not to contribute a line of trans-Siberian
matter to any other paper. Am now waiting to see
editor 111. re the Klondyke-Behring Sea trip, via Greenland
and the North Pole. But before starting- I’m convinced
there’s more money in selling pea-nuts than in Australian
journalism.

Well-known Victorian journalist, William Carrington,
died at Melbourne the other day, aged 50. He came to
Victoria 20 years ago, put in a long spell on Melb. Herald
staff, and then became Weekly Times editor. He was
incapacitated by ill-health a couple of years back.
• • • *
“ U.”: Me “Falder’s” remarks about inaccessible
editors (27/12/’00). It seems to me that, barring excep-
tional occasions, there is little to complain of in their
inaccessibility if they will consider copy that is sent to
them. A really narking kind of editor (and a fairly
common type) is th e one to whom the best copy in the world
would be of no use unless backed up by the presence of
the writer. That species of alleged editor reads no out-
side copy unless it is delivered by the writer in person,
along with a lecture in which he points out the
beauties of his own phrases. As the most persuasive
talker has the greatest success in getting matter
into print, irrespective of its quality, the resulting papers
are often fearful and wonderful productions. Another
species of nominal editor (I have encountered three of
the type) is very accessible and extremely polite, but
tells would-be contributors that Mr. Blank (a director)
must approve any copy for which payment is required.
Similar grotesque realities could be told about various
other rags, having editors who are always on view. Leav-
ing the editor who is no gjiitor out of the question, I find
that the comparatively secluded man is invariably
and more business-like than the one who is so much on
view that he has little time to go through copy. (Hear !
Hear ! I—Ed. B.)

“ U.” : Murmurs pervaded inky circles, many months
ago, concerning a newly-appointed Argus steerer with
original views, who was going to shake our penny Grand-
mother out of her prolonged literary lethargy. The
change seems to be a long time arriving. Any Saturday’s
Argus is the same old collection of English and American
clippings, and the ordinary issues show no remarkable
change. Certainly, including Foster Fraser’s Russian
articles, the Argus now runs two imported serials where
there used to be only one. Is that the prophesied re-
form ?

Died lately, Miss Laura Hansard, gran i-daughter of the
original printer of House of Commons debates. Luke
Hansard turned out his first volume in 1803.
• • * *
“F.H.R.”: A correspondent asks, “ What is a fail-
time to give pars., when not acknowledged, before decid-
ing they are not accepted?” I claim to have written the
champion long-distance par. for The Bulletin. It was
printed just two years after being submitted for con-
sideration, and was written for the fourth act of a contro-
versy rc the ’goanner. It kept until another controversy
arose on the same objectionable bed-mate. The subject
was a list of the contents of the ’go’s stomach after
dinner, and no doubt the Aboriginal man gave it time
to digest.
“A.G.T.”: Your “Australian scribe in London" (B.
25/10/’O6) is rather shaky in his facts, and I expect he has
been listening to Fleet-street gossip, which beats a
woman’s club for gossipiness. The lies I heard myself
were as follows : —Of Pearson’s three papers the Express
is not doing badly, and the Evening Standard is almost
not doing badly ; but the Standard— well, it pays for
the paper, at any rate. Most of this year it has fed the
maiden ladies and country curates who are its “ constant
readers,” with the aid of only two, or, if you count the
news editor, three reporters, and just after the New Year,
a well-inked pen did some damage to the salary list.
When Pearson took it over he tried to combine the
dignity of the old paper with the display of the
Express, and didn’t succeed. The Tribune started
on the same tack, and did it much better,
and ought to have succeeded. But the funeral no-
tices have already been prepared, so it is said. The first
editor was given an absolutely free hand in the matter
of exes. He spent like a nabob. He left after six months,
and a reign of economy and a new editor succeeded him.
It would pull round now if millionaire Thomasson,
who owns it, hadn’t been so upset at losing £lOOO
a week, and seeing the advs. sticking at a steady
eight columns a day. The staff, anyhow, had a good
time, and the dozen or so subs, will be grieved at having
to take their legs from under their big oak tables with
the inch-thick Turkey carpet and easy leather chairs and
ash trays and all.
This is truth. Now for some of your correspon
dent’s yarns. The Daily Mail’s circulation isn’t a million
yet. It touched it once, during the war, but most of
this year—it’s been a bad year all round—it has been
down somewhere round the three-quarters- The Mirror
(whose chief sub., by the way, is an Australian; has about
balf-a-million buyers, mostly working men, who won’t be
bothered to do more than look at the pictures and read
the headlines. The Chronicle, the livest and best-
written of any, is flourishing, and is extremely sorry it
ever came down to a ha’penny. The Telegraph, child of
the London fog, flourishes on its small ads. and the
people who read them, and is the best-paying concern in
Fleet-street.
As for London editors with £3OOO a year, the last of
them (and perhaps the first of them, too) was Byron
Curtis, of the old Standard, and he hasn't had a suc-
cessor. The highest-paid men now are those like Mar-
lowe, of the Mail, who is more manager than editor, with
the business side strongly developed.
One thing your man hasn’t said, which isn’t gossip, is
that there is probably no job on the Inky Way easier than
than that of sub. or reporter in London. The up-to-date
papers have huge staffs of subs, (the Daily Mail has 14,
when they are not being sacked), and care and accuracy
come before speed. Reporting is being killed by the
news-agencies, Which cover every sort or kind of conceiv-
able engagement, so that the staff has nothing to do but
special work or inquiries. The result is that, except for
a few “star” men, Fleet-street reporting is slack and
bad, and to get real good work of an ordinary kind, you
have to go to the provinces or the agencies. Subs, often
get copy from their own' men which has to be rewritten
from beginning to end, because the reporter can neither
spell nor write grammar nor tell a story. One London
reporter I know wrote, in perfect seriousness, about “the
glowing beams of old Sol," in describing a Labor demon-
stration in Hyde Park.

Although most Maorilanders can get some sort of a
privilege pass on the M.L. railways, by swearing to be a
newsboy, M.H.8., member of a conference, school child,
school teacher, or any of the various kinds of persons
entitled to a reduction, M.L. has lately decided that the
editor of a two-leaf newspaper has no right to state that
the local publican is a reporter permanently employed on
his paper, for the purpose of allowing Bung to travel at
quarter-fare. The chief reason for fining the editor
£2 10s., and heavy costs, was that the Bung was “ im-
possible ” as a reporter. For the future, he will have,
therefore, to be “rung in ” as some other section of the
staff—liquidator, for instance, if a liquidator comes
within the benefit of the regulations.

Anti-Sosh Bent is making another attempt
to assist the Gippsland farmers to establish the
sugar beet-industry. Five hundred Anti-Sosh
farmers have guaranteed to grow three acres of
beet for five years, and the State will make it into
sugar for them. Difficulty was experienced at
first because the Anti-Sosh 500 argued that the
State should also cart the beet from the farms and
otherwise assist in the growing, but they finally
agreed to lean up against the Government only so
far as the sugar mills were concerned.
A function which seems to have got
crowded out is the formal declaration of the poll
at Federal elections. Lately the air has been fnil
of wails from successful and defeated alike, who
have woke up some morning, a couple of weeks
after the election, to find that the returning
officer had announced, on the day before, the result
of the contest (which everyone had known for
over a fortnight), and, in consequence, they had
lost smother chance of expatiating on their griev-
ance or their gratitude. Fact is that the official
declaration in Federal elections is an ohsolete
institution. When the count is finished in a few
hours, the announcement of the returning officer
is an event of excitement. But when the result
is not definitely known for weeks, the official pub-
lic declaration is superfluous. A Government
Gazette notice should take its place.

BRONCHITIS
CURE
The Famous Remedy For
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, Sc CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
Those who have takep this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Sreathing, Hoarseness, E*airi or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most bdmforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
Chronic, hor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where “Coughs” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
Beiarare of Imitations ! The great success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get i*

The Blessed Peace-maker.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O’ER the Southern Sea to an islet fair,
Where the palm-trees grow and the air
is balmy,
Went a pious man—an expounder rare
.Of the telling text and the soothing psalm he.
In his hands he carried ’a medicine chest,
And a book of hymns of some sort or other,
For his mission there wETs a holy quest—
To convert to tfewth his discolored brother.
On his back, secured with a length of line,
Was a pulpit tall of the plainest pine.
This most reverend stranger was hale and strong,
And a Baptist saint of the purest water.
Zephaniah Gill was his name in long—
We may call him Zeph. when we need it shorter.
On its four stout legs was his pulpit set,
On the green hill-side ’neath a palm-tree
stately,
And a congregation of natives met,
And behaved them Selves on the whole sedately,
For the Reverend Zeph. had a winning style,
And a fond and fat ministerial smile,
To the savage heart of each heathen belle
Zephaniah Gill won his way instanter.
They adored his manner, which blended well
Patriarchal grace with a pleasing banter.
But the chiefs grew jealous and grim, and they
Were impelled to foster an evil schism.
They refused to go on their knees and pray,
And they scoffed at hymns, and despised bap-
tism.
But they showed a curious interest still
In the proper person of Pastor Gill.
When he marched the vale with his dusky choir,
Or his converts led to their first immersion,
The backsliders sought to provoke his ire
With direct assault or a burlesque version;
But the pastor prayed for their sinful souls,
And they knew derision would not defeat him,
So they greased the spit, and prepared the bowls;
For the common weal ’twas resolved to eat him.
Said the Nogo chief : “Never waste your wit
On this problem, men —make a hash of it! ”
To the holy man, with a note polite,
Went a feathered chief* a satiric sinner,
In ambiguous phrases he did invite
Zephaniah Gill to a native dinner.
Zephaniah went in his best black coat,
And a speech to suit the occasion he knew,
But his heart bumped up, and it clogged hiS
throat
When they handed him the official menu.
Yea, the bill of fare was a painful blow,
It was “ Missionary and a yam or so ! ”
Zeph. was seized and plucked by the hirelings
stout.
Then began a rattle of disputation.
O'er the angry yells of the wicked rout
Rose the wailing cries of the congregation.
’Twas the Nogo chief who declared in brief
They would take their prey, and uniquely oil
him.
And then roast him whole; but another chief
With an oath declared it was best to boil him.
The discussion spread to a oommon broil—
For one-half screamed “Bake!” and the other
“ Boil! ”
In his wrath at having his lunch delayed
Nogo struck the chief of the boiling faction
With a twelve pound nullah, of shark bone made,
And he put him definitely out of action.
But another chopped with a neat stone spear
At old Nogo’s lobe, known as occipital,
And that warrior spun on his royal ear,
And abruptly abandoned the whole recital.
Then the carnage spread, while the chosen feasfl
Impartially prayed for the poor deceased.
Till the dark they fought. With emotions mixed
Zephaniah watched the unholy slaughter,
In lys mind m.uch troubled ajid torn betwixt
The consuming fire and the scalding water.
He had always heard of the burning flame
As a fate post mortem condemnatory;
He was Baptist truly, but, all the same,
When the water’s hot it’s another story.
He had. never taught to his island flocks
That baptism by boiling was orthodox.
When a month had sped still the feud was kept.
And one crowd was led by a stalwart broiler
Who upheld a spit, and the other sept
By a brawny savage who bore a boiler.
But the saint was back in his vineyard new,
Which the maids and matrons were gaily tilling,
Though the elder sons stabbed their fathers
through,
Or were cut off by them without a shilling—
An example truly to me and you
Of the mischief too many cooks may do !
While the men pursued their guerilla raids,
And they cut their friends when they met with
axes,
Parson Zeph. grew fat ’mid his buxom maids
On the yams and pigs that were paid in taxes.
But he sorrowed much o’er the boys. To stem
The pernicious waste and the agitation
He despatched his choir to appeal to them
To submit their quarrel to arbitration,
Which, as there were left but a score and two.
The opposing forces agreed to do.
Pastor Gill was happy to arbitrate.
When they came to him, and he made digres-
sions
On the crime of war and the sin of hate,
And on sweet forbearance and fair concessions.
They were much impressed, and they rose to say
They believed their conduct was most improper.
They would split their difference right away.
And they did—alas! with their bluntest
chopper.
So at length the natives were reconciled ;
They had one half baked and the other boiled l
via.
EDWARD DYSON.
Parker.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CHILD sweating, remarked the Clerk
of Courts oracularly, as the door slammed
behind the Bench, is not confined to
the lower orders. Even I have suffered. It ■was
Parker in my case ; the princely Parker.
Everyone who swore, did so by Parker, and
those who didn’t approve of swearing, said he was
a terue Keristian. He Was everybody s friend,
and his delightful manner would have warmed
the heart of a tombstone.
I was sick of school at fifteen, and the mater, as
usual, went off to consult Parker, who asked to
see me. He shook hands confidentially, and I
grew two inches on the spot.
He proposed engaging me as a kind of junior
clerk at ten shillings a week, to begin with, with
the prospect of being eventually taken into part-
nership if I worked well.
I grew a foot.
It was an estate agency, auctioneering business,
and all that. Especially all that, for any amount
of people liked to have an archangel look after
their investments and adjust little financial
details; Parker, too, was so very discreet and
gentlemanly an archangel.
That prospective partnership made me work
like fury. I used to get to the office at 8, take ten
minutes for lunch, another ten for tea, and shut
up shop at half past nine. Parker also gave me
copying work to do at home after hours, hoping
as he handed it over that I was not overworking
myself.
In six months I was collecting rents in the
slums, and I often wondered why the poor devils
didn’t pull me in when I held out my hand for
their money.
It gradually grew upon me that I was being
sweated, skilfully but systematically. I was
doing the work of a couple of full-blown clerks,
and a rise had not been even hinted at. When
approached on the subject, Parker was ‘ pleased,
more than pleased.” I could not help feeling how
kind it was of him to be pleased. But he was
taking another gentleman into the office, a nephew
of his, who would halve my labors. Notwith-
standing this, however, he would raise my salary,
as I had asked for it. I expected a pound. He
gave me 12s. fid. But I slaved. Lord ! How I
slaved, spurred on by that halcyon thought;
Parker and Me.
The nephew turned out to be a superior variety
of relative, vj'Jio couldn’t be bothered with any-
thing mote fatiguing than bossing me, and in the
course of another year the prospective partnership
passed peacefully away after a lingering illness.
When it was quite dead and had received deep
and decent burial, I saw an ad. : “ Clerk wanted
for three months, salary £2 10s. a week.” I
applied in person and got tfie job.
In the course of a funereal farewell the man
who had so shamefully sweated me for two years,
gave me a hand that felt like frogs, and said he
would pray that things would turn out better than
he feared. By some subtle means he made me
feel ungrateful to him, and passing through the
streets I imagined persons looked and whispered :
“ There goes that fellow that treated Parker so
shabbily.” Parker told my people that he had
been disappointed in me.
Soon afterwards I got through the public
service exams, and went to the Crown Law De _
partment. It was five years before I met Parker
again. He had been arrested for embezzlement
on a particularly gorgeous scale.
I was clerk of courts and took the depositions.

FRANK HUDSON.
The Original Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE girl threw her magazine away from
her disgustedly.
“ Tommy-rot! ” she said.
The man smiled, and, stretching himself, turned
over in the long grass to look at her.
The sunlight, falling through the tall gums,
made a shifting pattern upon her dress, and once,
when a sudden breeze blew up all sun-laden across
the golden afternoon, it rippled her muslin
flounces so that they trailed seductively across his
hand.
Away upon the range a cow-bell rang its in-
sistent note into the silence, and the man lay and
listened to the drowsy call of it, contentedly
watching the girl through half-closed eyes.
“ -It is all tommy-rot —except this,” he said.
She did not hear his saving clause, nor properly
understand him, and she.leant forward eagerly,
her pretty hands clasped round her knees.
“Isn’t it?” she said. “You never see an
original story nowadays. Always the same old
thing ... a hero and heroine and a deadly rival.
Sometimes the rival is a man, sometimes a woman,
but it is always one or the other.”
“Always,” murmured the man. “Strange,
isn’t it? It couldn’t well”—this was quite in-
audible —“ be a horse or a wheelbarrow.”
“ Generally it’s a woman,” continued the girl,
unsuspectingly. “And then, when the heroine
refuses the hero—she always does refuse him at
first, and there’s never any reason—but when she
refuses him, he rushes away and makes violent
love to the rival.”
“I know,” said the man. ‘And then the
heroine’s hair grows grey in a single night, and
all that kind of caper ; and just as she is about to
die of heart-break in the last chapter, the rival is
killed in a motor accident, and they marry and
live happy ever after.”
The girl clapped her hands.
“ That’s it exactly,” she said. ‘ Sometimes it
i is a motor accident, sometimes another man; but
\ they get rid of the rival somehow, and isn t it
stupid ? Why can’t someone invent a new story:
“ Let us try,” suggested the man.
She laughed. ,
“What? You and I!” she said. How ab-
surd you are ! I couldn’t write a story if I tried,
and neither could you.” ~
\ “ But we needn’t write it, you know. We could
] —er—act it,” explained the man. “For instance,
' I might propose to you -
“ Ridiculous ! ” turning a haughtv back.
! “And you could refuse me. Of oourse, you
would refuse me ”
“Of course ,” more haughtily still.
“ And then I could rush off and marry Muriel
Graham. That would be quite original, because
Muriel wouldn’t be killed in a motor accident and
you wouldn’t grow grey in a single night, or any-
thing. Oh ! it would be beautifully original,
wouldn’t it ?”
“And extremely silly.’’
“Yes, it might be silly, certainly. Well, we
could put it this way. I jiropose to Muriel
Graham and she refuses me. Then J. rush off and
marry you, and you aren’t killed in a motor
ac”
But the girl interrupted.
“Do you actually imagine she’d refuse you?”
she inquired, with content. “Why—why-
why—she’d jump #vyou.” “
The man whistled.
“By Jove,” he said, “would she? That’d be
awkward, wouldn't it? But wait a bit. I have
it. Suppose we do away with the rival altogether,
and I propose to you, and you accept me, and we
get married ! How would chat do, Kitty ?”
The girl laughed.
“ Why—it—it—er—would be original, wouldn’t
it?” she said.

SORE FEET
A COMMON SUMMER TROUBLE.
EW escape the discomfort of undue perspiration of the feet in
Summer, and fewer still are they who do not know the torture of
blistered, sore and tender feet. Judicious
use of Zam-Buk Balm will make the worst
case yield. Zam-Buk should be applied to
the feet night and morning, rubbing it in
gently for a few minutes in order to pro-
mote greater circulation. This treatment
will be found delightfully cooling, soothing,
and pleasant, and Zam-Buk will regulate
perspiration, cleanse the pores, soften hard
gd
corns and absolutely abolish
all soreness. The following
testimony will in-
terest sufferers from
sore feet: —
“ Being an insurance traveller,” says Mr. W. Sims, of
139 Tynte-street, North Adelaide, “ I am a lot on my feet,
and very often suffer from sore heels. Upon the applica-
tion of your Zam-Buk Healing Balm the soothing: effect is
wonderful, and in a short time niy heels are quite sound
again. I have also found Zam-Buk efficient in cases of
chapped hands, from which I sometimes suffer. I always
keep Zam-Bnk in the house for the use of my wife and
children in the case of burns and scalds, &c. I have
pleasure in recommending Zam-Buk to fellow sufferers.
ZAM-BUK is used and recommended by doctors and
nurses, and is a SPEEDY CURE for PILES, ECZEMA,

The Case of Clarkson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE had ®een to see “Faust,” and
were arguing matters out.
“ Then you don’t believe a fellow
can sell himself ter the devil ?” said the man with
the loudest voice. “Well, I was your way o’
thinkin’ once, but since what happened ter young
Clarkson, o’ Tukehu, I've altered my mind. It’s
a queer tale, but Bill Woodley, that told us,
wasn’t no liar, as a rule, an’ it made a Wesleyan
Metherdist out o’ him. He turned teetotaller as
well, an’ took ter goin’ ter chapel hard, an’ he got
married, an’ tdbk up a bit o’ land, an’ got quite
uppish an’ respectable, an’ all becos o’ wot hap-
pened ter Frank Clarkson.
“It all come on some years ago, wen I was at
Wherowhero, helpin’ my aunt ter manage a, pub.
It was jist before she got married again] ""an’ give
me the sack fer biffin’ her new husband.
“Tukehu was the nex’ township ter Whero-
whero, an’ jjoung -Frank Clarkson was the son o’
the storekeeper there. They was very well ter
do, them Clarksons whips o’ money, an’ no end
o’ land as well. I knew Frank a bit by sight—not
thro’ seein’ him at our pub, becos he was a stric’
temp’rance bloke. His line was more tea-fights
an’ bun-scrambles, an’ Sunday-schoolin’, an’
mothers’ meetin’s, an’ that kind o’ racket. He
belonged ter a debatin’ society, an’ reckoned ter
get inter Parlyment, so he sed. I had no quarrel
with him, ’cept that he used ter put on no end o’
side, an’ call our hotel a ’bode o’ iniquity.
“It was Over a girl that he went ratty, same as
many another before him. Her name was Laura
Spindle—old Alf. Spindle's eldest girl. She was
a good-lookin’ piece o’ goods, an’ she an’ young
Clarkson was reckoned ter be engaged. She por-
tended to be as keen on mothers’ meetin’s as he
was, but she wasn’t that kind really, tho’ he did
useter call her his sister in the Lawd’s work.
Anyway, as soon as Harry Fleming come an’
started as a doctor at Tukehu, she cottoned on ter
him and took ter lawn tennis an’ socials fer a
change ; an’ presently she ups an’ gives Frank
Clarkson the bullet, an’ tells him that the best she
could do fer him was ter keep on bein’ a sister ter
him, becos Harry Fleming was her real bloke
now. Harry had asked her ter hitch herself up
to him, an’ she’d said ‘ yes,’ an’ they was goin’ ter
be married in September.
‘ ‘ That was most likely on the Sunday evenin’
after church, becos who should come inter our
bar at Wherowhero on the Monday mornin’ but
Frank Clarkson.
“I was took aback. O’ course I could see the
minit he pushed the door to that he hadn’t come
ter rouse about temp’rance, but ter have some
drinks. I say drinks, becos when you’ve bin in
the hotel line a bit, let me tell yer, yer can almost
tell by a bloke’s face when he comes in, not on’y
how much he’s goin’ ter have, but whether it’s
goin’ ter be a case o’ sliikker or not. An’ I don’t
think in all my natural I’d ever seen ,such a
drinkin’ kind o’ look as that feller had on him
that Monday mornin’.
“‘Good day,’ sez he, quite civil. ‘Will yer
be so kind as ter get a bloke ter take my port-
manter ter the station ? I want ter catch the
express. ’
“ ‘ Right,’ sez I, “ I’ll take care it gets there.’
“‘Thanks,’ sez he. “Here’s half-a-crown for
yer.’
“I pouches it. ‘She ain’t due fer more’n an
hour,’ sez I.
“‘I know that,’ sez he. ‘I want ter have a
drink. How do yer sell champagne ? ’ sez he.
“ ‘ Seven an’ six a small bottle,’ sez I, ‘ an’
fifteen bob a large one.’
‘“Give us a large one,’ sez he, ‘an’ two
glasses. ‘I believe,’ sez he, very polite, ‘that
it’s the usual thing ter ask the barman ter drink
with yer.’
“ ‘ Well,' sez I, rather modest, ‘ some gents
reckon it is.’ An’ I goes an’ gets the wine an’
uncorks it.
‘“Wait a minit,’ sez he. ‘Have yer any old
brandy ? ’
“ ‘ Plenty,’ sez I.
“‘Then put some in my glass, and fill it up
with champagne,’ sez he. ‘ I read in a book once,’
sez he. ‘ that that was the finest drink there is.’
“ Well, I did what he asks me, but I drinks my
champagne neat.
“ He lowers his lei ’stonishin’ quick.
“ ‘ That’s damn good,’ sez he.
“ I looks at him, an’ wonders wot the mothers’-
meetin’ mob ’ud have thought of him if they’d
seen him drinkin l an’ sayin’ damn.
“ ‘ Ter think,’ sez he, ‘ I’ve kep’ back from it all
these years, an’ all fer a faithless woman, ’ sez he.
“ ‘ Hard luck,’ sez I, quite symperthetic.
“ ‘ Mix me another,’ sez he ; an’ I did.
“‘Wot’s your name?’ sez he ter me after
gettin’ outside the second dose o’ his fancy tonic.
“ ‘ Jim,’ sez I.
“ ‘ Well, Jim,’ sez he. ‘ I don’t s’pose I’ll ever
see yer again. Let’s have another bottle.’
“So we has another, an’ while we was puttin’
it away he gets conjerdential like, and tells me all
about how Laura Spindle had thrown him over
fer Harry Fleming. It fair astonished me ter
hear-the cusses he called ’em both—l wondered
where he’cMearnt ’em. An’ he said how he was
goin’ ter have a big spree, an’ how he was never
comin’iback to Tukehu no more, but was goin’
clean ter the devil.
“ Well, I tries ter console him, an’ he calls me
a brick, an’ wishes he’d known me w’en he was a
nipper. Then I tells him there was plenty more
girls about quit.e as good as Laura Spindle ; an’
he would order another bottle. He was too full
ter finish more’n a quarter of it, an’H reckoned it
was up ter me ter go slow, so I corks it up again
fer myself later on, an’ plants it underneath the
bar-counter.
“ He must havq spent three notes with me in
an hour that mornin’, becos he buys a flask o’
brandy fer the train, an’ a box o’ cigars. He sed
he was goin’ ter learn ter smoke so’s to get to the
devil faster. I never met a feller so set on goin’
ter the devil.
“ Bvembye I heard the train whistle, an’ I was
rather glad, as he was gettin’ a bit out o’ hand.
It was a contrack gettin’ him an’ his portsammy
safe in the express ; but I did it, nice an’ quiet,
an’ the last I ever see o’ Frank Clarkson was lyin’
huddled up, shikkered, in a firs’-class carriage on
the Auckland special at Wherowhero.
“ Next we hears of him was from a bloke in the
bar that had jest come back from town, an’ who’d
seen him there spendin’ his money right an’ left.
’Cordin’ ter this feller,' Clarkson was at the
theaytre ev’ry night,’ an’ he’d been ter the races
bettin’ fer all he was worth, an’ he’d dropped no
end o’ boodle; an’ hg’d been turned out o’ the
Grand Hotel, where he was stayin’, fer biffin’ the
hall porter; an’ he was carryin’ on with some
girl from a draper’s shop, an’ drivin’ her about all
day, an’ givin’ her di’mond rings; an’ he was
shikkered twice a day reg’lar, an’ was sure ter get
jailed fer disorderly conduck onless he pulled
himself tergether, or cleared out fer somewherea
.else, quick an’ lively.
“ Then we didn’t hear no more of him fer a
month, till Bill Woodley come home from Aus-
tralia. Bill was the bloke I told yer about who
turned Wesleyan Metherdist on account o 1 rank
Clarkson. He was a bit of a hard case then, an
he’d been over in Australia some, time ridm
horses, or trainin’ ’em, or somethin’. Well, his
yarn was that he was walkin’ home one night in
Sydney, w’en he picks up a bloke out o’ the
gutter jes’ near where he lived. He props him up
against a wall, an’ has a good look at him, an ,my
oath, if he didn’t recognise Frank Clarkson ! Bill
was bred an’ born in Tukehu, an’, of course, he
knew the Clarksons well. He was took aback, I
tell yer, knowin’ wot a holy bloke Frank was at
home, an’ how he’d often an’ often told ,Bill he
was lost/ becos he took ter gamblin’ an’ horse-
racin’. But Bill was a good sort them days, an
he~sed he wasn’t goin’ ter leave a townie in the
bloomin’ mud ; so he carries Clarkson up ter his
lodgin’s, an’ puts him in his own bed, an' turns in
on the floor himself. .
“ Nex’ mornin’ Clarkson come-to a bit, an tells
him the whole yarn—how Laura Spindle had
jacked him up; how he’d gone on the tank at
Auckland, an’ how he’d come over ter Sydney
becos Auckland was too slow fer him, an’ how
he’d spent a hundred quid there in a week.
“‘How much have yer got left?’ sez Bill ter
him. Frank reckons it up an’ sez about thirty bob.
“ ‘ Look here, mate,’ sez Bill, ‘ I’m goin’ home
ter Tukehu in a day or two. Will yer come with
me if I pays yer fare ? ’
“First of all Clarkson sez he wouldn’t at no
price; but Bill got op ter him, tellin’ him that
he was now a feller wot had seen the world a bit;
an’, havin’ done in his coin, it was up ter him ter
go back an’ show Laura Spindle that she wasn’t
the on’y bit o’ stuff on the earth ; an’ Frank said
he’d think it over.
“ Then Bill tries ter get him ter eat something,
but he wouldn’t.
“ ‘Look here,’ sez Bill, ‘ I’ve got ter be out all
day on bizness or I’d stay with yer. Promise me
if I leaves yer that yer won’t go playin’ the goat.’
“ ‘.You get me a bottle of Three Star an’, a
book, ’ sez Clarkson, ‘ an’ I give yer my word I
won’t leave the, bloomin’ house.’
“ So Bill goes out an’ buys him the liquor an’
a book—it was the ‘ Horrers o’ Satan ’he got—
an’ he brought Frank a pork pie, in case he felt
hungry durin’ the day; an’ after makin’ him
comfy, he clears off to do his bizness.
“ W’en he got back very late that night, the
brandy was all gone, an’ the pork pie was all gone
too ; an’ Clarkson was sittin’ up in his bed, lookin’
fearful bad, tryin’ ter read the ‘ Horrers o’ Satan,’
which he couldn’t do properly, becos he was more
than half silly.
“ ‘ How d’yer feel ? ’ sez Bill.
“‘Oh, Bill,’ sez Clarkson, ‘D’yer smell sul-
phur ? ’
“ ‘ No,’ sez Bill, sniffin’, ‘ can’t say as I do.’
“‘The devil has been ter see me,’sez Clark-
son.
“‘Ho,’ sez Bill. ‘Has he? Wot sort of a
bloke is he? ’
“ * Oh, he’s fair enough some ways,’ sez Clark-
son. ‘ I’m goin’ ter have a bit of bizness with him
ter-morrer mornin’, at five o’clock. He wants
my soul bad, an’ I don’t want it no more now, so
he’s goin’ ter buy it fer three wishes, like the
bloke in the fairy tales you’ve heard on. I can
have any three things I want on earth in exchange,
an’ I’m goin’ ter deal.’
“ ‘ Rats ! ’ sez Bill. ‘ It’s that book you’ve been
readin’.’
“‘ It ain’t,’ sez Clarkson. ‘ It’s as true as yer
settin’ there. Why, I’ve had one wish already,’
sez he. ‘ I’ve had me revenge on Laura Spindle,
anyway; ’ an’ Bill sez he began ter laugh horrible
w’en he sed this.
“ ‘ Wot have yer done to her?’ sed Bill.
“‘Never you mind,’ sez Frank. 'You’ll hear
w’en yer gets ter Tukehu. I asked fer time about
the other couple o’ wishes. I wasn’t such a mug
as ter decide off-hand ; so the devil he’s given me
till daybreak ter make up my mind. Then he’s
goin’ ter appear an’ settle the bizness.’
“ ‘ That was pretty smart of yer,’ sez Bill,
humorin’ him like. ‘ Don’t ferget ter call me
w’en he comes. I’d like ter see him.’
“‘Oh, you’ll hear him all right,’ sez Frank.
‘He makes a terrible noise. He stinks o’ sulphur,
too. I can’t make out how it is y.er can’t sniff it
now. I can, an’ he’s been gone over an hour.
Don’t yer go puttin’ in yer spoke till I’ve finished
my bizness, will yer? ’ sez he.
“ Bill promised he wouldn’t on no account.
“ ‘Then I’ll intrerduce yer,’ sez Clarkson, ‘as
a friend o’ mine. I’m thinkin’ out them two other
wishes, an’ I’m readin’ this book again fer a
notion.’
“ ‘lf .1 was you,’ sez Bill, ‘ I’d wish fer a lot o’
money. Yer pockets are nigh on empty now, an’
yer’ll want it soon.’
‘“How many million would yer ask?’ sez
Frank.
“ ‘ Oh, one a month, paid punctual,’ sez Bill.
‘No good bein’ too bloomin’ graspin’. And, as
fer the other wish, I’d ask fer old age, an’ keep
the old bloke waitin’ fer yer soul as long as
possible.’
“ ‘ How long ? ’ sez Frank.
“ ‘Well, I’d make it a thousand years from ter-
day p'raps the end o’ the world’ll come before
then, an’ then he’ll be beat becos he ain’t kep’ his
part o’ the contrack".’
“‘Good idea that,’ sez Frank. ‘ I’ll make it
two thousand. I’ll ask them two wishes, an’
thanks fer helpin’. I’ll remember yer w’en it
comes off,’ sez he.
“ ‘'Now, try an’ get a bit o’ sleep before he
comes,’ sez Bill. “There’s nothin’ like a clear
head fer important bizness, such as you’ve got
cornin’ on.’ An’ with this, Bill makes up his
bunk, an’ undresses, an' blows out the candle.
“ Clarkson woke him twice durin’ the night,
sayin’ he felt very cronk ; an’ Bill got up, an’ give
him some sodawater, an’ made up his mind ter
have a doctor in the mornin’.
“ The third time Bill woke up on his own. He
heard Clarkson tossin’ an’ turnin’ on his bed, an’
groanin’ somethin’ awful.
“ ‘ Can I do anythin’ for yer ? ’ sez Bill.
“‘No,’ sez Clarkson. ‘Oh, my pore head!’
sez he, ‘ Oh, my pore head ! ’
“Bill was very sorry for him, but he knew he
couldn’t do nothin’, so he drops off ter sleep
again ; but, jest as he was goin’ off, he swears he
distinckly hears Clarkson say, ‘ Oh, I wish I was
dead ! I wish I was dead! ’
“An’ nex’ mornin’ he was dead. Make no
error. He was as dead as Pilate. An’ Bill had
him buried in Sydney, an’ come over here an’ told
his father. The doctor sed he died o’ somethin’
or other, but I reckon he died from his second
wish; so did Bill Woodley. ‘ I wish I was dead,’
sez he, an’ dead he was before daybreak, dead as a
doornail!
“*I went back and inquired about Laura
Spindle.
“ She was chucked by her doctor-bloke for
bein’ too flighty.; and she took it ter heart so
much that she moped fer a long time. An’ after
that she went blind, an’ after that she died. So
I think the devil kept his word in a general way.”
