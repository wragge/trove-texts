The “Loyalty” Dodge.
Db. Eenwick has certainly a voracious appeli
for humble pie. He was at no period of his oaree
as a Minister regarded as a considerable membe
of the Government; but until he explained at h
meeting on Friday night how impotent his voic
or his opinions had been to influence the policy o
the Administration of which he was a member, th
microscopic character of his insignificance hac
never been fully appreciated. His whole anxiet
in delivering his speech appeared to be how h
could moat comprehensively effect his own stultil
cation. If his ‘ 1 indepen dent ’ ’ utterances are to b
credited, there was scarcely an important part o
the policy or legislation of the late Governmen
of which he was a member, which had not bee
repugnant to his convictions. He had joined i
the Ministerial opposition to the proposed rai
way to Circular Quay, but —ho had always bee
favourable to the construction of the line. H
bad participated in passing the Licensing Aci
but—he considered that its operation had, t
quote his own words, “ brought dishonour o
those who had moved in the matter, and disgrao
on the Bill itself.” He had helped to bring in th
Land Bill which the country has just repudiated
but—he was utterly opposed to the system it wa
designed to perpetuate,
# • •
The unlucky ex-Minister was equally self-con
demnatory when he opened the budget of reform
which he wished to see realised. Ho desired t
see liquors tested, not only in the public-house
but in the warehouses of the wholesale dealers
Ho had “ attempted to get introduced ” into th
Licensing Bill a provision to that effect. This
which appeared to be the only action specifically
his own during his occupation of office that h
could call to mind, had been a failure. Bather s
lame argument, surely, why he should be electee
again to Parliament. But it is easy to oompre
hend how so complaisant a colleague as Dr. Een
wick stated that he had been —violating his mos
sacred convictions at any moment when they
clashed with the convenience of his leaders—mus
have fared when he ventured humbly to sugges
that wholesale dealers should be subjected to
analysis of the contents of their cellars and inqui
aitions into the quantity of white spirit they belt
in stock. It is notorious that one member of the
late Cabinet is about the largest importer o:
white spirit in Australia. If the tractable smal
Minister really ventured to hint at such
provision, there was one of his more masterfu
colleagues who would have had no hesitation in
ordering him to hold his tongue and mind his own
business. Next, his ill fate, or indiscretion, im
pelled him to refer to the grievances of the Civi
Servants with regard to favouritism and improper
promotions. “ Now, this was a matter,” he chir-
rupped, “ upon which, when he was a member ol
the late Government, he took some action, and his
desire was to introduce a Bill in reference to it.”
Really, the worthy Doctor is exceedingly unfortu-
nate, or else exceedingly stupid. Why would he
persist in hammering into people’s heads the cir-
cumstance that when he took action about any
matter, it invariably happened that nothing what-
ever came of it P And by what infirmity of mind
was he impelled to remind the public that, during
the four years that the Administration of which
he was a worthy member held office, the Civil
Service was so shamefully handled and nepotism
was so rampant that at the present time dis-
organization has reached a climax which can no
longer be disregarded.
* * •
But Dr. Eenwick’s most flagrant mistake
appears to have its root in a fundamental
disqualification for a legislative position.
Hd has been at extraordinary pains to
emphasize to the electors the fact that either
his intelligence or his honesty is defective.
His explanation relative to the Land Bill of
the Government of which he was a member is
absolutely sensational. It lands one in a per-
fect thicket of inferences, every one of which is
logically destructive to the Doctor’s claims to be
held in esteem. The Ministry of which he was a
.member framed this Bill, presented it to Parlia-
ment, took credit for it as embodying all that was
requisite for the good government of the colony
in agrarian matters. They staked their collective
credit and reputation upon it, spoke and voted
for its second reading, and thereby pledged them-
selves to insist in Committee upon the preserva-
tion of all its essential features. Def«ated on the
second reading, the Government inflicted a penal
dissolution upon the Assembly for its non-accept-
ance of the measure as it stood, and appealed to
the country to give them power to carry it through,
to that appeal Dr. Eenwick took active part.
He stood by the Bill; and had it embodied
the cherished emanation of his most sacred con-
yiotions, he could not have more loyally adhered to
it. Yet now that he has realized that the prin-
ciples of the measure are detestable to the coun
try, he suddenly confesses or professes that he
had always thought the Bill a bad one, and ex-
plains that only loyalty to his colleagues restrained
him from separating himself from the Govern-
ment-resigning all the sweets of place and pay.
It was loyalty to his colleagues which induced
Dr. Renwick to take part in foisting upon the
country an Act which he believed calculated to
work deep, grievous, and permanent injury, fie
preferred then that his colleagues should continue
to enjoy power which they were in his opinion
using to the detriment of the community, rather
than that, by his resistance, the country should
be saved from this flightful misfortune. He pre-
ferred the oonaonienoe of bad rulers to the inte-
rests of his country. Therefore, he can confidently
appeal to the electors to restore him to a position
where he can again subordinate vital public inte-
rests to his personal predilections. Admirable argu-
ment! The ex-Minister is a logician, evidently.
Agaih, his loyalty is so predominant (loyalty
carrying with it a position of distinetion and a
handsome salary), that ho is prepared to subordi-
nate his convictions to it. That is to say, he
would rather violate his most sacred principles
than prevent the country from being misgoverned.
Good again, most logical Doctor ! Another
most clinching reson why he should represent
every elector—who would do the same himself.
• • •
But this felicitious course of reasoning is based
upon grounds entirely in harmony with it. The
premises are as rotten as the argument. In the
course of the electioneering discussion, the em-
harassed ex-Miniater was charged with having at
last broken down in the virtue which he seemed
to regard as compensating for the violation of every
other, and with having abandoned his loyalty to his
colleagues as a desperate expedient for securing his
own election. It was charged against him, that in
vaunting his own affection for the principles which
hie Government’s Land |Bill was framed to op-
pose, he had glorified himself at their expense.
He was asked, what sort of loyalty was that P
This inquiry in no way abashed the ingenious
candidate. He disposed of it readily by explain-
ing that it cast no reflection upon his colleagues,
inasmuch as several of them, including Sir
Henry Parkes, disliked their Land Bill quite as
much as he did ! Then Dr. Renwick’s idea of
loyalty to colleagues is, abandoning his principles
and betraying his country, in order that they may
have every encouragement to abandon their prin-
ciples and betray their country likewise ! Per-
fectly clear and thoroughly satisfactory. If any-
thing had been lacking to prove Dr. Renwick’s
fitness to represent those electors of East Sydney
who entertain similar views—there wo have it.
• • •
But, once more, where was the necessity for all
the sacrifices—honour, principle, country, self-
respect—which Dr. Renwick made at the shrine
of loyalty, if, as he intimates, the majority of his
colleagues liked their Land Bill no better than he
did—that is to say, regarded it as utterly bad?
If the majority of the Cabinet were of one mind,
why on earth did they not, instead of prostituting
their convictions and betraying their country
bring in a Land Bill they did believe in ?
Enough of this farce, and of the unprincipled
farceur who has played it in the face of a dis-
gusted and horrified community. The naked
truth shines supreme through all this cloud of lies
and infamy. In the late Ministry, Sir John
Robertson, and one, or perchance two, Ministers,
believed in the recent Land Bill, and nonestly, if
stupidly, resolved to stake their positions on it.
The rest, Parkes and his tools, the Renwicks
and such, did not .believe in it—if the slightest
reliance ia to be placed upon even the moat pro-
bable of Dr. Bknwxck’s contradictory and self-
condemnatory explanations. But they cultivated
the virtue of loyalty—one and all; of that loyalty
of which the candidate for East Sydney has told
us so much. But loyalty to whom or what? To
Sir John Robertson? Assuredly net. They
effer him as a scape-goat, To principle? No; Dr.
Renwick takes credit for having abandoned it.
To their country ? Certainly not; they believe d
the Land Bill would be injurious to the country.
To what, then, were these faithful heroes loyal ?
What remains? POWER! PLACE! PAY!
Dr. Rsnwick has at least merited the thanks of
the community for the demonstration he has
afforded them. As an involuntary Common
iNFOBMBte AGAINST HIS OWN REPUTATION
AND HIS LATE ASSOCIATES IN THE MINISTRY,
HE IS AN UNPARALLELED SUCCESS.
Sir Henry Parke. K.C.M.G.
Now that the above functionary has received a
most humiliating defeat, it may be of some ser-
vice to him, and more still to the country, to point
out a few lessons that can be drawn from the
transactions of the past few months. Wo shall
make no apology for discussing his public career
in a plain and unmistakable manner, for it is as
true that his actions are public property as it is
unfortunate that the public will have to endure
the results of those actions. He came to the
colony in 1839, an uneducated youth, without any
influence or connections, and worked his way by
the sedulous exercise of an ambition —that has at
length proved his ruin—to his present position in
the affairs of the colony. But energy and ambi-
tion are qualities to be admired only so far as
they are rightly directed. The early political
prospects and opportunities of the late Premier
were, in every sense of the word, the most envi-
able. His has been the privilege of standing
shoulder to shoulder with men whose best energies,
abilities, and aspirations have been devoted with
wise discretion to the uprearing of our colony on
lines of permanent national success; he has
enjoyed, at one time or another, the good wishes
and assistance of most of our foremost legislators.
These advantages, coupled with the encourage-
ment and support ho received from the public and
the press, opened out a magnificent prospect of
possibility. No young politician in a young coun-
try could possibly have had a future more preg-
nant with manifest and splendid opportunities of
earning time-worthy laurels in the comparatively
virgin soil of colonial politics; and no young
politician—bo his prospects never so dismal, his
talents never so contracted—could, after forty
years of active political life, find himself in cir-
cumstances of greater disrepute and contempt.
• • •
Yet Sir Hknbt only wanted one thing to make
him the greatest statesman Australian has seen—
that one thing was a desire to advance his adopted
country independent of himself. What was said
of Goldsmith, that “even his vices leant to
virtue’s side,” can be truly inverted and applied
to Sir Hknbt Politically speaking, “ even his
virtues lean to vice.’’ The ambition which in
others would have been a healthy, patriotic in-
centive, was in him so saturated with selfishness,
that the term “ ambition ” only half describes it.
And yet he had, or ought to have had, sufficient
knowledge of statesmen and statesmanship to
know by observation what he was unable to
detect by intuition —that political extinction and
ignominy invariably overtake the man whose
energy owes its vitality to selfishness, and whose
ambition is devoted to personal instead of national
prosperity. Unlike the true statesman, who, in
the consideration of matters of national moment,
“resolves not rashly, but once resolved is strong
unlike such a one, he has had no resolutions or
opinions of his own. The pliant creature of
majorities, he is found one day supporting a
measure, the next denouncing it; one day the
sworn antagonist of a man, the next his flattering
friend and colleague — in tact, his inconsistencies
are as flagrant and indefensible as any on the
records of political depravity. He has turned
completely round on almost every important ques-
tion that has agitated the public mind for the last
twenty years, and has invariably exposed his hand
by following with obsequious submission the
seductive clamours of the mob. Like a political
shuttle-cook, he has been tossed from party to
party and question to question, and at one time or
another has been the friend or colleague of almost
every political man of the present day. But it
fortunately happens that by the wise ordination
of Pbovidbngjc, those men who have been poli-
tically dishenest and untrustworthy, find them-
selves sooner or later deserted, despised, and
opposed by even the companions of their infamy.
In his long career of parliamentary oscillation, Sir
Hknbt Pabkks must have noticed and felt this
keenly. The recent trip he took to the Old and New
World, instead of opening his eyes to his compara-
tive insignificance in the world of politics and
letters, only aggravated and inflamed his arro-
gance ; and, rendered helpless by the Weakness of
age and ignorance, and blind by the vanity which
is so often their concomitant, he abandoned him-
self to utterances, humiliating to the colony and
discreditable to himself. Worse, if possible, has
been the course of action he has pursued since
his return : the people through their representa-
tive, have been treated with imperious disdain
and gratuitous insult. One would have thought
him too much of a tactition to endeavour to treat
the people, the pgess, the Parliament and oven

JB5000 Writ for Libel I
The Morning Rum states, in its issue of Wed-
nesday. that “ The editor of The Bulletin has
entered into partnership with a Sexton." This
is a most damaging libel. There is no connection
of any kind whatever between The Bulletin
and the proprietary of the alien journals known
throughout this country as the Rum and the
Shsoud.
A rather sad event occurred last week at Prince
Alfred Hospital in the death of Mr. Robert Gariooh,
first mate of the N • rthumborland, immigrant ship. He
died from heart disease, aggravated b? tho exposure
and ex trtion resulting from the misbam to the ship in
Botany Biya few months ago. Mr. Gariooh was the
son of Captain Gariooh, an old colonial trader. He
leaves a wife and family, resident in London.

character of a prominent politician can
very often be correctly guaged by the immediate
and intimate supporters of his policy. That Admin-
istration is always to be distrusted which has col-
lected around it, like so many birds of prey, poli-
tical sycophants and wire pullers—whose motives
are distrusted by all who do not despise them.
They are generally men of no political principle
or ability at all. They compose the vile political
scum of hypocrisy,wedded to incapacity, ignorance,
and greed, which is being constantly pitchforked
by lodges and orders, from the obscure dunghills
of bigotry to seats in the House. Their mere
presence contaminates and degrades our chamber,
aud places it far beneath the ambition of men of
character and capacity. By many of these pitiable
creatures has the ex-Premier been supported., and
we have no hesitation in saying that he has been
closely associated with men who have done more
to corrupt and emasculate the public life and
Civil Service of the colony than any others siaoe
its foundation.
• • •
The public will often overlook vanity or indis-
cretion in young and untried men. It is only
when they remain blindly proud and ignorant in
the faoe of age, experience, and failure, that they
become the deserving objects of universal con-
tempt. Sir Henry Parkes has seen both failure
and a long lapse of time and experience : but his
weaknesses have become more pronounced and
hia indiscretions more frequent and flagrant than
ever. Ten years ago he would not have thought
of acting as he has since his degrading alliance
with his old rival and enemy, Sir John Robert-
son. If this pseudo p»ttiot and quondam
Premier has any desire to save from utter digrace
a career which he has failed to make honourable,
he will do well either to overcome that impudent
arrogance which has mainly brought about hia
-'resent misfortunes, and was last evinced in his
correspondence re supply with Mr. Stuart ; or
else, retiring for ever from public affairs of the
colony, find in the solitude of obscurity what
recompense he can for forty years of energetic
scrambling for place and power. Sir Hwnry has
done a good work in warning younger politicians,
and will ever be remembered by a grateful nation
as the man who proved conclusively that no one —
be his opportunities ever so great, his friends ever
so powerful—is so indispensable but that the
colony and the world can do without him.
Journalistic Larrikinism.
The recent antics of the Evening News have
occasioned a good deal of remark, in which amuse-
ment has been blended with disgust. The News,
it will bo remembered, took an active share, lately,
in exposing the maladministration of the Parkes-
Robertson Ministry, and joined in the general
chorus of denunciation of its land policy. The
conductors of the News expressed a desire to see
a Ministry in office which wonld undertake in an
energetic way to repair the faults and omissions of
the late Cabinet, and to substitute a wholesome
land-law for the system which has so long been
corroding the vitals of the colony. These were all
proper and decent exercises of journalistic func-
tions, and had the News, on abstract grounds,
when the new Cabinet was formed come
to the conclusion that, despite the professions
of the Ministers, they were collectively un-
fitted to do the work, or, by their past characters
disentitled to confidence, it would have been right
and proper to offer them an intelligent opposition
on those grounds. The public has already dis-
covered that the Evening News has rushed into
bitter antagonism to the Stuart Cabinet. There
has been no room for mistake about that. The
News turned round against the Cabinet in a single
day. But no reader, not having a knowledge of
what was passing behind the scenes, could gather
to what cause the sudden and ferocious animosity
displayed by the News was due.
• • •
This animosity was not an “ intelligent’Voppo-
position. There was scarcely any explanation
offered. The public was presented with the crude
fact that an extraordinary change of front had
been made, and people were left to fish out -a
reason for themselves. It may help to elucidate
the mystery, when we recount a chapter of the
inner history of Mr. Stuart’s cabinet-making.
While that gentleman was engaged in selecting as
colleagues those gentlemen whom he regarded as
best qualified to assist him in discharging his
duty to the expectant community, he was sur-
prized to receive a visit from Mr. Alfred
Bennett, a young man, who by the untimely
decease of a shrewd and thrifty father, had in-
herited the control of the Evening News. This
youth, who had at no time been distinguished by
literary aptitudes or a comprehensive grasp of
any larger principle than that a penny saved
is a penny gained, had apparently had it
shoved into his skull that the accident
of his decent had vested him with an here-
ditary title to nominate a Minister whenever
a Cabinet was being formed. He took upon him-
self to intrude upon Mr. Stuart, and to press—
nay, to insist —upon the inclusion ot Mr. John
Sutherland in the Cabinet. Mr. Stuakt
demurred to this dictation, and ventured to in-
timate that he might reasonably place more
reliance upon his own judgment, matured by
nearly as many years of parliamentary experience
as his volunteer counsellor had enjoyed months of
existence—a judgment, moreover, endorsed by
the choice of a powerful majority of the represen-
tative men of the country—than in the unexplained
preferences of a raw boy, whose abilities, but for
circumstances which had not been of his own
controlling, might have enabled him to attain the
position of a second-rate type-pioker. Mr.
Stuart did not, of course, express himself so
concretely, bat he demurred to the impertinence
of the young and ignorant visitor’s intrusive
advice, and adhered to hia refusal to bo coerced,
even when given to understand that the penalty
of following his own judgment wonld be the an-
tagonism of that organ of “ public opinion ’’ the
Evening News —that is to say, Mr. Alfred
Bennett’s opinion—otherwise the ideas which
cleverer schemers had made that lad a vehicle for
conveying.
• • •
Mr. John Sutherland not being included, in
to Mr. Bennett s wishes, in the
Ministry, the attacks of the Evening News com-
menced forthwith—attacks marked by a puerile
pettishne- s Of scope, and a childish incoherence of
passion which astonished even more than they
amused all who remembered the shrewd dexterity
with which tho journal was conducted by the late
proprietor. Nothing was too small a theme for a
big assault. The absurd incompetence of the
general who undertook this ridiculous campaign
was freely exposed by the pomposity with which
he marched his whole forces to attack the most
inconsiderable outposts of his enemy. The
Ministry oonld not send ont a picket, but the
whole camp of the Evening News was put in
commotion, its entire forces pat in line of battle,
and its heaviest artillery ordered to blaze away.
But the quality of the rancour which animated
these futile demonstrations was made most
apparent by the persistency and intemperateness
with which Mr. Copeland— who was evidently
regarded as tho interloper who had been preferred
to Mr. Sutherland— was assailed. No false-
hood was too gross, or too clearly disproved for
reiteration; no candidate too objectionable for
preference. Within but a few weeks of the time
when the Evening News had spewed Dr. Hen
wick out of its mouth as an adherent of a corrupt
and dishonoured Cabinet, it, with scarcely an
attempt at concealment, expressed a preference
for that candidate rather than Copeland, and
returned to lick him over as a dog returns to its
vomit.
• • *
This astonishing exhibition has borne its fruits.
In other days the Evening News has wielded a
very considerable influence. Its decadence under
the present regime of childishness and irrational
or interested petulance is measurable by the result
of the last East Sydney election. Evening
News, John Davies, John Sutherland,
Bigotry, Falsehood, and Bum, all working in
unison, swayed but 1400 electors at the poll out of
nearly 4500 who recorded their votes.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Royal Cowardice
lx will be gratifying to low people, who have no rever-
ence for blue blood aud ancient lineage, to know that a
member of the British House of Commons some short
time since accused no less a person than his Eoyal
Highness tho Duke of Edinburgh with cowardice or
cruelty in leaving a shipwrecked crew to perish. The
particulars are these ; A German barque named the
Woden, with a crew of fourteen hands, ran ashore on
tho Qunfleet Sands, near the Essex coast. The crew
took to the tigging. The ship began to beat herself to
pieces and sink rapidly in the sand. At this dreadful
time the drowning sailors caught sight of a vessel
steaming up apparently to their rescue. But she
passed by without even a sign of sympathy from those
on board, aud left the poor devils to die. Admiral the
Duke of Edinburgh was in command. Admiral the
Duke of Damnation I When the members ot our Boyal
family cease to be men then we cease to respect them.
Give the Duke his due, however. When ho had got
safely into Sheerness, and, doubtless, after he had made
his toilet and cleaned hia illustrious teeth, also strung
his noble nerves with a glass of sherry and soothed
them with a cigar, ho deigned to take a languid interest
in tho fate of these common persons, and gave orders
that a telegram should be sent to Harwich conveying
the information that a vulgar vessel was in absurd dis-
tress on the Gunfleet Sands. Immediately the telegram
was received, a life-boat was sent out to t he wreck; hut,
by the time it got there, ten of the crew had perished.
The other four had been rescued by two poor little
fishing smacks, the owners of which were not afraid to
put out to sea to help fellow-creatures in peril. But,
of course, the life of a Guelph is too precious to be
risked in this way. You won’t get a Duke of Edinburgh
like ours everyday— God be thanked.
The Speaker will work a beneficial reform if he Will
actively deal with members of the Aa’embly who are
disorderly in a sneaking way. There are some honour,
able members who never, when addressing tho House,
go beyond the mildest namby-pamby, and who, conse-
quently, do not come before the public as offenders
against good order and propriety, yet who are the
originators of half the “scenes” which occur. They
are too sly to say anything, bat when another member is
speaking in deadly earnest, they make a practice of
tacitly insulting him with visible sneers] and demon,
strative inattention. Sir John Bobertson was guilty
of this conduct the other day, when in the course of
Mr. M'Elhone’s reference to the Land Act, he inter-
"jeoted a laugh, meant to be annoying. Of course, Mr.
Speaker can't anticipate a demonstration of that kind.
A laugh does not, like a sneeze, take time to get ready.
But he oonld save, by promptly reprimanding the
offender, the insulted member from having to “ taka
the matter into his own hands” even in the way of
appealing to him for proteotion. When a man is in-
sulted, he resents it, whether the insult be put in an
officially recognised form or not; and unless insults be
put a stop to, no matter in what shirking way they are
conveyed, the Speaker will be chiefly to blame, if one
of these days one honourable member throws a volume
of Votes and Proceedings in the faoe of another, and
follows that np by sitting on the hon. member’s head.

ONE OP THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
TTN a recent conversation in Kingston, finna/ia, with -
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Triokett, the celebrated'
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the'
world, gave the following as his opinion.
“ I have found St, JACOB'S t)ia sure and certain
Cure, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in back, brought on by ovor-ex.
ertion in rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sure
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble.'*
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to hear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he .vayg
that St. JACOB'S OIL aod good athletic training, at
what all our young men want.

Harry Power, the Victorian bnahranger, is now
nearly seventy years of age, and is looking forward to
a speedy release from Pentridge Gaol. He was arrested
in the year 1870, and sentenced to 15 years’ imprison-
ment, to which an additional six months was afterwards
added for escaping. Next August, Power will have
-ompleted 13 years, and, as his conduct has been good,

friends are memorialising the Victorian Government
on his behalf, and promise to provide for his sustenance

“ Professor” Gilbert, the social philosophy
lecturer, w’. o lost his libel action against the Mary-
borough (Q ) Chronicle, turned out to bo a man of
straw. Woodyatt, the persecuted newspaper proprie-
tor, obtained costs against Gilbert, and these mounted
a p to £200. But Gilbert hadn't a stiver. This is the
freedom of which Australians boast. A conscientious
newspaper proprietor is at the mercy ef any villain who
likes to entangle it in law expenses, even though ho
hasn’t the shadow of a ease against it. No guarantee
of costs is required from him at all. In Woodyatt’s
5598, the Maryborough public took the matter up, and
soon subscribed the necessary amount.
William H. Vanderbilt, the American million-

trotters, is determined to stable his horses in a palace.

polished wood, inlaid with blaok walnut, and the
backets and mangers are adorned with big brass mono-
grams of W. H V. The coach-house is radiant with
mirrors and polished woods; and the horses, when they
have returned from a trotting match or exercise, walk
from the coach-house to the stables on a broad strip of
red cloth, as if they were Princes of the blood royal.
It is rumoured that Vanderbilt's next extravagance
will be a diamond-mounted set of trotting harness.
Professor Edward Henry Palmer, the English
scholar who was lately killed by the Arabs in Egypt,

reoords that when they were walking out together one
dav near the Foreign Sailors* Home, at Limehousa,
Palmer espied a friend in charge of a cart, with baskets,
with whom he exchanged five minutes of question and
greeting in Romany. On the steps of the Home were
twe men balking in the sun; one of these was a Lascar
from Calcutta, the other a burly negro who hailed from
the Soudan and talked some kind of In the
conversation which followed, both men having a budget
o( grievances to unfold, it was evident! P Cftls or no
effort for Palmer to pass from Arable to Hiridu?|».ni and
back again, turning from one to the other while both
talked at once.
There is a little German woman in Melbourne,
who may be daily seen standing at the corner of Swan-
ston and Little Collins streets. She speaks to no one
saTe-puhcemen. She labours under the delusion that
someone has left her £100 as a legacy, and that she is
some day to receive it at that corner. She has been
examined magisterially several times, but, as she is a
harmless monomaniac, her liberty is not in'erfered with.
Shn owns property in North Richmond worth over
£10CO, and has made an agreement whereby no money
is paid on her account without tho signature of her
eldest son, who is 22 years of ago. This poor woman
ia posaessed of but one mad idea. Would it or re her,
we wonder, if somebody actually did pay her £400 at
that very corner ? We commend the experiment to
Onnmi, or some philanthropist who is tond of outri
liberality.

“ Two Stories, a Fragmentary Poem,” by J.
Farrell, published at Melbourne by A. H. Massina
and Co., is no feeble versification laboriously put
together by an everyday poetaster ; it is the work of a
man of genius. The “ two stories’* are the stories of two
loves; but so incoherent, so curiously presented,
that they can hardly be told. A youth who is betrothed
to a maiden sets out to win the wealth which shall give
him a right to claim her. In a foreign land he succours
an old man, dying, who, in gratitude, gives him a price-
less gem, whoso value enables the youth to go and
claim his bride. These two men, the youth and the
sage—the one made happy by his true love, the other’s
life blighted by a false woman—toll each other their
stories. The plot, if there be any, is simply an incom-
plete skeleton whieh the poet surrounds with his own
wild, strange ideas, and clothes in a shining splendour
of words. As he tells of the tropical" island where
monster diamonds sparkle In a cavern mid heaps of
human bones—of the horror of the would-be suicide,
alone in a boat on the midnight sea with the corpse of
his old false love—of his blind wanderings through the
blistering heat, the nightly horrors and unutterable
desolation of the desert —of the passionate love of the
youth who succours him—one feels the spell of his
great descriptive power. The whole poem is a piece of
weird and wondeiful imagining, such as Poe might have
conceived. We see poetry of such merit seldem, and
the success Mr. Farrell has achieved in this beautiful
fragment is, perhaps, the more remarkable because we
know that in poetry of a totally different character he
is equally clever.
Neither the Queen, nor any one of her children,
is ravishingly beautiful (we hope this isn’t high trea-
son), but of them all the Princess Louise has most
claim to be considered good-looking. She bos regular
features, a fair skin, flue shoulders, and an elegant
figure, with none of the Qnelph tendency to 11 spread
out " Though serious, there is no German stolidity in
her disposition, and she “takes” wit readily. She is
highly accomplished, and her landscape paintings,
designs, and literary efforts are above the standard of
the mere amateur. In fact, the Princess, like Patience,
has '* a good deal of good in her.” When she reached
20, it became necessary to marry her. But to whom ?
It was not easy. Louise, in her trips to the Continong,
had noticed how German princes smoked and spat, ate
raw salt meat to give them a keener relish for beer, and
were as slovenly as pointer pupa out of uniform, and as
stiff as toy soldiers when in; and Louise made up her
roval mind to have none of them She had never
mixed so much in society as her elder brothers and
sisters, and those few aristocrats whose lineage and
possessions wore considered suitable did not manifest
any eagerness to have het. It would not do for a royal
daughter to “ choose " and be refused! After two or
three disappointing oas’s of the hymeneal fly. Her
Majesty and the Duke of Argyla between them made a
final throw, and landed the Marquis of Lome. He was
clever, a traveller, affluent, of the first lineage, and
really admired the young lady; so Louise was brought
home in triumph to Inverary. She is a moderate
success as the hostess of the vice-regal house in
Canada ; but is rather too earnest, and not quite frivo-
lous enough, for somo fashionables. As regards the
people, when she was new to Canada, she did not quite
understand them. She treated them too much as those
in her station are always accustomed to treat English
poor folks, who are drilled to hold themselves lowly and
reverently before their pastors and masters and num-
bers of the upper crust generally. But her good sense
amended that little error, and she is respected by all,
A good deal has been said in Parliament about
the appointment of Messrs. Ranken and Morris to
inquire into the working of the Land laws, and the
public will naturally be anxious to learn all they can
about the two gentlemen in whom the Government
have so much confidence, and whom some members of
the Opposition have taken exception to as not fit for
the work. Who is Mr. George RankenP He is a sob
of the late Mr Ranken, of Gonlburn, one of the
earliest free settlers in Australia, and is a native of the
colony. His youth was passed to a great extent in the
bush, and, inter, he was a squatter in Queensland, In
the year 1868, Mr. Ranken having like so many other
people lost his station in the crash of I860, was ap-
pointed by the Queensland Government as Land Cora-
missioner, to work, in the Port Curtis district, the
Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868—the first genuine
free-selectiou Act in that colony. A leading feature of
that Act was identical in principle with one of the
main propositions of Mr. Stuart’s suggestions upon
which the country has just decided. That is to say,
the squatters’ runs were divided into two portions, an
indefeasible lease of one half being given to the
squatter, and the other portion being thrown open to
“selection before survey.” It was part of the Land
Commissioner's duty to superintend the division of
(he runs, and to recommend for resumption the half
best suited for settlement. This was an immense
power to entrust to any set of men, especially as the
squatters wielded vast influence in political affairs.
Some Commissioners abused that power shamefully.
They assented to the most unequitable partition of the
runs —the bulk of the good land on one side of the
dividing line, and the bulk of the worthless country on
the other—and deliberately recommended the resump-
tion of the latter for selection purposes. But one or
two Commissioners evinced a diff runt disposition and
sense of their obligations. These one or two refused
to countenance any but fair divisions, and, while eHord-
ing every reasonable latitude so as to permit of the
pastoral lessee preserving, when possible, his head-
station improvements and a good werking ran, they
adhered with resolution to the spirit and intention of
the law, and never tailed to recommend the most suit-
able half of the run for resumption. Amongst these
one or two. Commissioner George Ranken was con-
spicuous. The divisions in his district were models of
fairness, and throughout his tenure of the Commis-
sionership his management of the intricate business,
consequent upon the introduction of a now system of
tree-selection, was distinguished by uprightness and
ability. There was the minimum of friction between
squatter and selector, and the maximum of content-
ment on both sides. Commissioner Ranken’s success
as an administrator was unequalled at the time, and we
can only remember one Land Commissioner—Mr.
M'Donald—who could lay claim to equal fairness
and capacity. We can spenk on these points
with decision, for a sufficient reason. We
have a personal and intimate knowledge of the
whole business. Almost simultaneously with Mr.
Banken’s appointment as Commissioner, the present
Editor of Ihk Bulletin was appointed by Mr. E. W.
Lamb, then Minister for Lands in Queensland, and now
of Sydney, to a position in the head office of the Lands
Department, and all the papers and official transactions
connected with the division of runs or other duties per-
formed by the various Commissioners passed through
his hands. He had no acquaintance with any of tie
Commissioners at the time, but from what he observed
of their transactions he was impressed with a lasting
contempt for some of these offl lers, as partial or in-
competent, if not corrupt, and with an abiding respect
and esteem for one or two, as capable, courageous, and
honest. Prominent amon£ the latter was Mr. Commis-
sioner Ranken, whose official acts and decisions for over
three years were constantly under our Editor’s obser-
vation. At the end of about that time Mr. Ranken
resigned and removed to Sydney. Hera he has for
years been recognised as one of the ablest authorities
on land legislation. Under the nom de plume of “ Capri-
oornus” he has from time to time contributed able and
thoughtful essays on this his favourite study to the
columns of two Sydney newspapers, and to all
who have paid attention to this branch of legislative
study, Mr. Ranken has long been well-known as the
leading expert in this part of the world, and as a power-
ful and consistent opponent and critic of Sir John
Robertson’s system of land legislation—the system
which the constituencies have jnst pronounced effete
and bad. This is, no doubt, the reason why Sir John
himself in the debate on the address in reply, sneered
at Mr. Ranken, by an oblique reference to him as one
of “ two or three iuoapables," V the decision of the
constituencies be taken as a criterion, it is surely Sir
John, and not the foremost antagonist of his repudiated
system, who is stamped with the brand of incapacity.
Considering that the constituencies have decided that
Sir John's land system is radically bad and objection-
able, there appears a peculiar appositeness in the
appointment of Mr. Bauken, who so long and so ably
has devoted hia talents to exposing the fallacy and bad-
ness of that system, as a Commissioner to show in
detail where the effects of the flaws are to be seen in
actual existence, and to suggest in what manner a
remedial measure had best be adjusted. Mr. Banken
is complete ly en rapport with the people of the colony
in this matter. He is thoroughly experienced in the
sort of work now entrusted to him, he is competent,
of proved ability, and of inflexible integrity. He pos-
sesses private means adequate for his wants, and al-
though he was the other day beaten by a small majority
in his cauoidature for Parliament, hia defeat was rather
ascribable to his lack of the slippery and insincere arts of
the professional politician than to any objection to
himself personally. Had the electors better Known Mr.
Banken’s merits, we do them the honour to believe that
they would gladly have availed themselves of his
services.

Sir J. Hannen, President of the Probate and
Divorce Court, has ordered letters of administration
to issue to the estate of the missing Sir William. Augus-

Uou, 1860 Thomas Emery Leak, who died the other
day at Cendobolin, was honoured with the largest
funeral—about 850 persons following the oortdge—ever
seen in that wonderful little town. He has acted there
in the four-fold capacity of jonrnalist, doctor, chemist,
and land agent, during the last seven years, and was
known as the most generous and self-sacrificing of men.
He was a native of Cromer, County of Norfolk, Eng-
land. Previous to bis Condobolin career, he was for a
short time aoting-C P.8. at Forbes. He was an old
Mason, and had the regulation masonic honours paid
to hia manes Three youug and particularly gallant
officers lost their lives in the Egyptian war. Captain
Wardell, who fell at Tel-el-Kebir, came of good military
stock, and was an officer of great energy and premise;
his brother, Captain G. V. Wardell, was killed at
Isandnla while fighting gallantly with the 24th. Cap-
tain Warden’s widow gave birth to a son on the very
day he met his death at Tel-el-Kebir. Major Henry
Harford Strong, the senior officer, kiUed in the same
battle, was snot through the heart while most
gallantly leading his fighting line up the glacis. He
was a man of great promise, and was born of a rare
fighting stock. His grandfather and five of his uncles
were in the navy, one of the latter having been a
“middy'* on the Conqueror at Trafalgar. Major
Strong leaves a widow and five children. Commander
B vson, B.N., who was mortally wounded at Tel-el-
K oir, was a young effloer who had won promotion by
hi. gallant services. Two days before his death, while
ly i ig in the hospital ship, stricken down with his
wi unde, he was raised to the position of Com-
mander “for valuable and gallant services ren-
de ed at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir” .There's
a young fellow named Jean Condoist in Paris
wbo is drawing visitors to him. His anatomy suddenly

ye-rs of age, and 6 ft. 3 in. high. Next morning he was
6 ft. 4in. 1 Tnen he took weekly self-measurements,
and on Sept. 14 found he had grown five inches. He
mated heaven by another five inches by Jan. 20, 1882;
sprouted seven more inches by March 15th, and now
stands 7 ft. 10 in. in hia stockings, and his feet are
already 24 inches long ! iro Bligh's champion can now

relation to the Queensland man), in his day the strongest
man in the world, died recently at hia home near Cleve-
land, Ohio, U.S. He was 6 ft. 6i in. in height, and. his
average weight was 264 ib. Amongst other feats, he
once lifted from the ground an iron shaft weighing
17001b.; he frequently lifted his horses up to the floor
of his earn, which was three or four feet above the
ground; and be beat in wrestling Charlie Freeman, the
American giant, who afterwards went to England and
conquered the “ Tipton d asher,” the then champion.
He never doubled his fist on a man for fear of hiding
him—his blew being equivalent to a kick from a horse

A companion said “ you’re a ooward.” “ Possibly,”
replied the retreating philosopher, “ but I’d rather be a
coward for the next five minutes than a corpse for
ever.” Ihe Bev. James Beecher (half brother to
Henry Ward Beecher) has drawn notice to himself by
his eccentricities. Some years ago, he resigned a fairly
fat pastorate at Poughkeepsie to wander, knapsack cn
shoulder, among the fastnesses of the Bocky Moun-
tains. Finally he build a house in a wild spot among
the Catskill Peaks, on the borders of a wooded lake,
with scarcely a human being in the distriot, except
hia wife and daughter. Binoe 1875 they lived there ;
but recently his friends, thinking “ there’s a sheet of
bark loose" have placed him under restraint in an asylum

Eiguold is doing very well over here. He has staged
Tom Taylor’s " Lady Clancarty," and it is a success—
a success in spile cf cheap mounting and indifferent
soling. It is a pity that sensational trash should
always besuperbly staged, when sterling plays are smug
on, so to speak, with a pitchfork. Colonial managers
always do this Consequently, such dramas as “ Oian-
carty " are only successful on the strength of their own
intrinsic merit. Mr. Biguold’s Lord Clan cany is gal-
lant and gorgeous in outside appearance, but inside a
shellf d peasood. Mr. Eignold is, in advance of all his
other artistic qualities, a magnificent postuier. He has
fjw other artistic qualities. Miss Nayaro's Lady Clan-
catty is the feature of the play. Miss Henderson is
nothing as Lady Betty Noel—a most charming character
in itself. Toe others aie as much less than nothing as
it is possible for stock actors who come to Adelaide to
be ; atd then possibilities in this oiteo'lon seem to be
endless. 8o for the Eignold company, What was it the

The third subscription concert of the Western
Suburbs Musical Society was given at the Burwo„d
School of Arts last Wednesday night, lc was pretty
good, but not very. There seemed to be a sort of feud
among the instrumentalists Each played for his own
hand, so to speak. The solos of Mr. Peroy Jones and
the playing of Miss Hyam were the beet things of the
evening And they might have been the best m much
(musically) better places than Barwood Mr. Qeo did
not ting as well as usual. In (act, if we hau to choose
between the singing of Mr. Gee and that of a cherub,
we should take two chances on the cherub, though,
perhaps, we might not get such good chest notes

with unspeakable joy that we noticed both of them

The Theatre Royal Pantomime. Eh, hien nuoi
done? Something, of course. Something •• of the one
part," as “Wholesome Fun” would say, is the pheno-
menal business that has been done. In its fifth week
and the theatre crowded nightly. People perspire in the
dress-circle, and stand np in the stalls. The pit is a
human barricade, and the fam’ly circle a living beta-
comb This is very good—for the management. So
good that not a single one of the trio comes to Sydney
for fear of spoiling the Inch, and Goodie reigns supreme
Thus, he is now in receipt of an average of twelve
lillct doux nightly from the ballet. Here is an authenti-
caked copy of one of them—tho original ©f which lies
in Abraham’s—we mean in Goodman’s—bosom

All the pantomime is now famished with new
locals and song-verses. This would have occurred
before, but for the elections. However, the world
stood still, and so many heads went round during the
East Sydney sensation, that a little delay— especially
on the part of the author—will te excused hv a for-
giving and long-suffering community. The Mathews
Brothers, both in the " opening ” and in the harlequin-
acie, are inimitable. They have introduced (seasonably
enough) an electric hat-trick, which is certainly a most
wonderful performance. Thu success of the panto-
mime, it is everywhere admitted, is largely due to the
extraordinary entertainment given by thewo extra-
ordinary acrobats To tee their perforu ance from the
dress-circlo is soptising enough ; luttoview it from a
stage-fccx, from whence you can gauge the difficulties
of every leap and bound, it is truly wonderful. These
boys, including little Carl, arc wonders. And wo like
to give wonders a pasting notice.

At the Opera House. “ Boccaccio ” is an opera
full of pretty music and piquant situations. ' The dia-
logue is good. In fact “Boccaccio” is a production
with merit in itself—a work that does net require the
.1 na-crack gew gaw attractions of the “scenic artist ”
It if, however, well enough mounted to do It justice
and to please a critical audience. And tho artists
engaged in it sing better thin we have heard them do
for a long time. Etnelie is an enclumching “Boc-
caccio,” but it would take the pen of a bladen to do
justice to this personation of a brother-poet.

Mr. Armes Beaumont also set ua wondering.
We never t new h« had so much humour as he showed
in his impersonation of Pietro. Mr John Forde, as
Lambertuccio—which Mr. Appleby, of the Dunning
Corapaty, mates a screaming part—is damp and
mouldy. This style of comedy doesn’t suit him. In
other things we have seen him in, he has been very
good Mr Far ey (Pealzo) and Mr. Harding (L onetto)
are both excellent—Mr. Farley more so.

But Johnny O’Neill was the man. This cele-

well. Let Nicolini tremble for his laurels.

Taken altogether, “Boccaccio” ia a moat en-

Mr. Ninian Melville, M.P. for Northum.
berland.
In this issue we give a portrait of Mr. Ninian
Melville, M.P for Nort'umberland, the demo-
cratic constituency, par excellence, of New South
Wales. Minus his crotchets —on the score of
which he has often been the butt of Bulletin
satire—Ninian Melville has been a useful man in
politics. He is honest. He is attached to-day to
the men whose cause he espoused sixteen years
ago. He works for hia living—labouring at his
trade like a man. And he employs his gift of
speech to better purpose than mere blathering.
Many a good cause has been benefitted by a neat
sum, the takings handed over to Ninian Melville
after a lecture, and promptly banded over by
Ninian Melville to some deserving institution, or
for some charitable purposes. [Photo- by

Dean Leonard is having a spell. 'Tis said that
he and Archbishop Vaughan are not cousins. The Dean
is letting his beard grow—so &f, observes a wag, to look
as unlike a priest as possible. He'll always look like

A New South Wales Christian Defence Associa-
tion has just been started in Sydney. Its object is the
defence of Christianity, by means of lectures, dis-
cussions, essays, and the dissemination of anti-secu-
larist literature." Hew the heathen-minded who never
go to church must chuckle over this 1 A society of
this sort In conjunction with the Salvation Army, and
assisted by a new religions paper, is all that is required
to make people turn Thogs.
Somebody writing to something in the journal-
istic way of business, lately remarked that there were a
number of unscrupulous men going about who were
playing it very low down on credulous Christians by
pretending to “ have had special interviews with their
(rod. We have seen some of these inspired persona
before now, and if there be any truth in the saying that
cleanliness is next to godliness, we judge they must
have talked to the Almighty through a telephone.
. -Hooray! Moody and Sankey have been showing
in Paris to empty houses. The total of the collections

They are regarded by the Parisians as unamusing

over there. Some cf its members were run into gaol
immediately they started their menntobanking on the
boulevards. The difference between them and their
fellows in Australia is that the latter have mostly oome
out of gaol.
Sixty-seven out of 123 charges of crime made
against preachers in the United Stales during one
quarter of the last year concerned women. It is just a
trifle remark able that crimes of this kind are so common
with holy men. But perhaps this is a wise provision of
Providence to enable us to have the company of reverend
persons in the next world. In other words, criminals
of this sanctified stamp are the salt of hell. Brethren

When the R.C. Lisbon of Maitlond went home
this time three years, his college was £3000 in debt. A
collection being made afterwards through the diocese,
£12b0 was raised towards its liquidation—together with
£800, the result of a bazaar j still, notwithstanding
this large sum collected, when the books were duly
audited a short time ago, the debt was three thousand
pounds, no shillings, but ton pence (£3000 Or. 10d.>—ton

tha Tasmanian Catholic Standard says, “Catholics
have a law and a conscience in. these matters. Non
Catholics have not. Catholics are engaged in building
up, non-Catholics in pulling down, God’s work.” Very
pretty, and so conservative.
The Holy Howl states that a man of means at
Maitland, named iK'Oormick, who wasn’t a Catholic,
was Jortified in the Homish faith before he died—that is

A Glasgow “ meenisther,” writing to a digni-

they are, considering the quantity of good Australian
gold they see the ministers bring with them when they
leave us to go back to their hungry home. We can
just fancy each hatcbet.faeed Donald and shock-headed
bandy sharpening bis teeth as he gazes with envious
eye upon tne ample paunches ot these travelled pas-

THE PRAYING PARSON OF GHOST-TOWN.
You’ve heard of Ghost-town, have yon not ?
Yon have, we do not doubt it j
Or you have road, or else heard said.
An awful lot about it P
Well, anyhow, we don’t much care—
We’ll just say there’s a parson there.
He prays for ev’ry thing all day:
Was fora "slavey" angling
Woo'd house keep, wash, and take for pay
" Eight bob." and do the mangling—
Scrub all the floors—the pork.chops grill—
And—well, it seems he’s praying still.
He plays at cricket: it does seem
That all the time he’s playing
For victory for his own team
He all the time is praying.
He prayed he might get “ four to log,"
But -iitan gave nim a “ duck-egg,"
Ho prays all day for preferment;
Prays for a presentation j
And, tor a gocKi “ roll-up’ - in Lent,
He spouts a supplication.
But, somehow —we don’t wish to scoff—
Whate’er he prays for, don't come off.
The Salvation Army is spiritually drunk. Let
us be explicit. We do not moan by this that the mys-
terious and subtle essence which men call the soul is
disturbed, but merely that the mental balance is lost.
All ideas of proportion and perspective are mixed up.
The Most High God, whose name the reverent Hindoo
will not speak except iu his heart—the God over whose
temple was graven, when Ho was worshipped as Isis,
the mystic sentence "lam that which is, that which
has been, and that which shall be; and the veil that is
over my face no man shall ever raise"—is now an eld
friend and orony of any crazed creature who may think
fit to wander round howling His name through the
streets God is now a "jolly good fellow"—at least
His praises are sung to the air of a well-known pot-
house psalm which contains these words. Just here let
us point out so.-aething. Whenever people of a

that if ha thought this he would give up his

are, for instance, Kitty Moogin, a sylph of some

we get into the half-caste column the Family Hekalu
nomenclature preponderates over the soft suggestive-

In consequence of the crim-

pay up their accounts, a certain
country journal is now issued
upon paper which looks as if it
had been struck by leprosy. It
is rumoured that times got so
hard in the office of this journal,
that the proprietor had as a last
resort to kill and skin his editor.
This may or may not he true,
but it at least explains very
neatly why the material which
the journal is now printed upon

who writes this paragraph be-
lieves it to be true anyhow, be-
cause the clipping which was

When a new bar is put up
in a certain Northern town the
local paper calls it a "signifi-

should say it was a sign that
whisky was handy. Bat, what
is a “ significant sign,” anyhow ?
Wo suppose the editor of the
paper in question would describe
a "(screwed” party as a person
in a state of "drunken intoxi-
cation.” From his extraordin-
ary notions of English grammar we are inclined
to think this noble litterateur must bo a Chinaman.
We should be sorry if we find our suspicions are cor-

We live and learn —at least some of us do, and

recent issue of an apostolic abortion that Sir Garnet

solely through the “unceasing care of Providence,
whieh constantly watches over those who rest apon its

out the stigma onr recent rulers threw upon it when
they blasphemously declared the Woniera wreck, the

" visitation from God.” Therefore, we beg to propose a

Somebody tried to set dro to the Shoalhaven

were the case. If the proprietors of country papers
will get so rich, and will persist in the injudicious plan
of keeping large sums of money in their offices, what
can they expect ? People say that it was a matter of
notoriety and general discussion all over the town on
the day before this attempt had been made, that three*

When cutting through the wavelets came
A steamer—never mind the name.

With tresses soft of ohesnut hue.
With eyes of grey and eyes of blue.
Afar all looked so nice on board—
But when they steamed up near—Oh, Lord!
Late in the even of the day
Before they’d sailtd for Chowder Bay,
A merry crew of fays and tars,
Full-bearded, smoking big cigars :
And each tar as he left the shore
Had on his arm one fay or more.

As she danced to the band of brass;
And as camo peeping out the stars,
A gay time had these jolly tars !—

them. They clubbed together, and went round to tbeir
relations with the hat of solicitation. The result was
that they got quite a nice little sum of money together,
which they expended in giving this mighty harmonist a
piano and a farewell food. But he hasn’t gone yet, and
hasn’t shown tho slightest intention of going. There ia
therefore, mnoh sullen discontent among the boys, wbo
say that, if he can’t give back the dinner, he ought, at
least, to return the piano. We think, if they want it,
it would be better if they were to redeem it themselves
before the interest becomes too heavy, or the legal
peried expires.

Asa rule, we are dubious
about tho general veracity of
snake yarns; but this one has an J
air of sincerity about it that
at once recommends it to onr
favourable notice. A few Sunday
mornings ago a snake five feet
long was seen cantering along on
its tail, with head ercot, flash 5 rg
eyes, and ejecting long hissing
streaks of blue flame from its
alligator jaws. Everyone about
the place at once left on import-
ant private business. Then the
snake took possession of the
pub., locked the doors, armed
Itself with a corkscrew, and be-
gan to sample and finish all the
bottles on the shelves until it
oamo to one containing pepper,
mint. In all probability bla
snakeship was a widower, and,
therefore, not compelled to re-
sort to strategy and sick excuses,
as it was noticed he drew the
line at peppermint. Ihen be

It ia generally admitted

It is this: let the State pay a
premium to every young man
who reaches a certain age, pro-
vided he gets married, and give
the young woman ho weds a
dowry. Let the funds to do this
be made up out of a tax to be
imposed on tbe friends of every
person who dies under a certain
age—that is while there ie any
work left in him; and another
tax to be levied upon those who
live after their usefulness has
gone, and when they are good
(or nothing. The revenue from
this latter source ought to be
sufficient to start every young
couple in the colony in house-
keeping. We should like to
know what some of our Judges
and members of the Upper
Home think of this plan.

Jerome J. Collins, the Irish-American journalist,
who died in the Arcti. night when the Jeannette went
down, was perhaps one of the greatest benefactors of
this age. He was the discoverer of the law cf Atlantic
storms When ©n the staff cf the New York Herald,
he mads a number of experiments which convinced
him that it was possible to foretell storms in Europe
from the Atlantic seaboard of America. His predic-
tions, cabled across the ocean at tfce expense of the
most enterprising paper in iho wcrld, were at first
ridiculed, or at best accepted as curiosities, by the
English papers. But facts are facts, and tell in due
time. In 1878, he attended the Meteorological Congress
in Paris to find that his theory of storm warnings was
accepted by the beet meteorologists of the age. It has
since been elaborated into a science. The Celtic
Magazine says:—“Mr. Collins was born in Ireland on
October 17, 1881, and that he died on June 13 of the
same year," it takes an Irishman to die before he was
born, and do such a lot of things in the meantime.

There is a point in connection with the New

which ought to be raised are : — 14 Was the Grafton
agent of the Clarence River S S. Company aware of the
captain’s condition ? If so, to whom is he responsible for
having permitted tha New England to leave in charge
of an incapacitated captain P” Of course, the Marine
Board have no jurisdiction in a question of this kind
over the agent of a vessel; but It blame be deserved,
it is desirable it should he publicly saddled on the

English and Foreign papers have been ringing
with tue heroism of a ship’s steward, who saved the lives
of all hands on board the ship Santa Anna when it was
wrecked on the Point Luis rocks. The English ship
Jupiter was in the harbour when the doomed vessel
was seen to go on the rocks. The English boats tiisd
again and again to face the surf, but were always beateu
baok. An effort to shoot a line attached to a shot over
the vessel failtd, when the steward of the Jupiter, by
name Charles Salter, volunteered to carry the line to
the wrecked ship. T-Tis captain and mates tried to die-
suade him, but he persisted in his offer. With nothing
on but bis trousers, belt and knife attached, and tbe
looped line over bis shoulder, he entered the surf;
twice he was beaten back by the tremendous waves, but
watching his chance he dived under a wave, and swim-
miug under water got clear of the surf, and with power-
ful strokes cleft his way on his errand of mercy. Bv
means of this communication, the whrale of the crew*
32 in all, were landed, tho last to leave the ship bring
Salter, their deliverer. What a contrast this is to the
conduct of Pilot Smith at Clarence Heads. This Salter
was, until lately, a steward on board the Zealandia, and
is, we believe, now in Australia.
Like our Burke and Wills’ expedition, the
Jeannette voyage towards the North Pole was badly
managed, because the men, howevor plucky, were
ignorant. An experienced agent of the Alaska Fur
Company, from whose northernmost station De Long
started, explains that the loss of tho party was without
doubt caused by their killing their doge, which no
Arctic traveller ever.dreams or doing who knows their
tremendous value. The Indians rely 'entirely on the
wonderful scent and sagacity of the dogs to supply
them with food. The agent says:— 44 The Indian I gave
De Long was as brave a man as ever fated the terrors
of an Arctic sea, and capable of great heroism. Wnen
De Long was dying, the Indian nook off his coat and
laid it Over his commander. I have no doubt that he
kept his courage up until the dog died, and then ro.
signed himself to his fate." De Long’s diary tells how
this Indian, after drawing the sledge all day, would go
out at night and get buds; and he kept the whole
party alive for two weeks by his own efforts. Again,
De Long had heavy gun«, to carry ball only. He saw
sea-fowl flying over his head all the time, and ootild
not kill them. There were fish in plenty under the ice,
but the party had no fishing tackle •• Put men on such
an expedition," added he, 41 who have been raued in
tho northern part of Alaska, who know all about tho
region, and there is a good chance of success."

Then he says in self-deleaoe ” If the editor of tne
M ineb w ro tried by a j ary of matrons, of plain women,
tho wives of honest, decent miners, they would say the
article in the M ineb on Thursday on the ball was true
and riohly deserved." He then deals characteristically
with the other leader-writers he has “spotted," attribut-
ing the second article to a Mr. Russell, and calling the
third “ a coin pound—a cross out of Lissner's office ana
his friend Robert. ’’ A sort of mule article, in
fact. Circumstances next require that Thady must
"have at" the Townsville papists. He finds a 44 new
hand at the bellows" on the Northern Standard in
Mr. Mackay, and scratches his back a litoio by con.
trastiug the Standard with its local contemporaries,
whom he sets iso»u thus :—“ The Townsville Herald
is an old Ministerialist fosril, nowdn the last stage of
drivelling idiocy and maudlin hiccups. The Townsville
Bulletin, having sat on tho fence until it made up its
mind on which side the largest piles was to be made,
has at last made its choice, a;-.o is now a declared Coolie
organ and a land-grant enthusiast." But he slates them
all impartially for ignorance and misrepresentation,
and Mr. Waagepetersm, ci.de van t editor cf the Stand-
ard, is particularly muuled, as "working in the
interest of a party in Charters Towers, who has an action
against the editor of the Norihbrn Miner, which is
coming off in Townsville." buys Thady:—“Some
of the bust men in Townsville Snow and say that
Charters Towers would be a regular boll only lor the
Hokthirn Miner "
A meeting was held in Parramatta, one evening
last week, to discuss the -heerful sutject of imra-
mnral burial. The proceedings passed off quite
pleasantly. The chairman opened the disontsion in a
speech which indicated clearly that his affection for
cemeteries would not be thoroughly dove'oped until he
was dead awhile. Ti.cn another speaker followed, who
made no secret of the fact that sweeter to him than
nerd and cassia was the delight of studying a tomb-
stone all day. and chatting with a ghost ua the top of
it all night. Just here several nervpus people went ont.
But the speaker—who had evidently made sepulchres a
speciality—wenton trippingly with his wormy statistics.
He knew something about gi avey ards, he did. Here is
one of the airy items he had picked up in his prowls
through the places of the dead. Wa quota :—•* In 8t.
John’s burying ground, the corpses wen p led om on
top of the other, until the topmost coffin was within
three tho surface, and when tho piled up etrch
tell in chrougn the da my of the coffias, hollows weio
formed, into which blow-flies swarmed and deposited
their eggs." This is nice, this is. And we suppose
eg» s were hatched in i ime, and things came out
of them which in due time ware metamorphised into
Shroud writers. This would account for the wonderful
knowledge which tne latter havs of the precise style of
literature which is most suitable to the taste of the
dead. To return. Several speakers got up in their
turn, and each had somathing earthy to say. But tbe
man who knew most aoout the question—the man who
was acknowledged as a final authority on the subject—
tho local undertaker, in fact—made the must sensible
suggestion of all. It was to the effect that a hearse
(should run regularly from Parramatta to the Rookwood
Cemetery. We suppose the hearse would be his, but
this little stroke of busine* s is pardonable for its
novelty. J ust picture to yourself, dear reader, a oorpae-
ooaoh drawing up before the local ccfiiu-factory, and the
driver calling his fares with a whittle made out of a
marrowless thigh-bone. T hen imagine the people
swarming out into the streets humping coffins on their
backs And then think of the man who would coma to
tho coach-station an hour before tho time, and laugh
oont inually as at an endless joke. He would be sitting
on a otffia. His mother-in-law would be inside. Car-
tainly, we think the Parramatta ccffia-cooper’s pro.
posal is, if not the most p racticable, at least tbe funniest
we have ever heard.
A CAROL OF COONAMBLE.
Let’s sing a song in Terse that does
With simple smoothness amble :
The burden *s love—revenge; the place
That sylvan spot—Coonamble.
Mary is the heroine’s name,
A fair “domestic" creature,
And she knew one Josiah Johns,
A Sabbath-day school teacher.
Now, Mary was a buxom lass,
Aad went to buy a bonnet;
And Johns her figure misconstrued,
And made remarks upon it.
But Mary had a sweetheart, who
In this sad strait stood by her.
And round he came with doubled fist
And “landed" that Josiah.
And, when the case came on in Court,
Up srot her beau, and said he—
*•' I am, I'd have it understood.
Engaged to this ‘young lady.'
■* I’ve loved her long, and loved her true
I’ll take my Alfred Davy,
And hear me swear to be the slave.
For ever, of this slavey.
Another “ lady ” ups and says.
With face as red as fire—
** I have been offered button-loots
To walk with that Josiah.
“ He came and axed me as I was
A sctubbin’ our verandah.
But ne’er to giddiness like this
Would I consent to pander.
“I scorn all button-boots that come ”
She stopped—no word came after;
The beaks all smiled—the Clerk of Pot-
ty Sessions led the laughter.
Five bob, the fine I" their worships said.
Anti each seemed to oonstddy *
Coonamble fast was bordering
On the exceeding giddy.
We can’t write more, or perhaps you would
With modesty expire:—
J . It’s just as well to mention, though,
’ They all were in the choir.

A Queensland correspondent writes thanking
The Bulletin for its outspokenness relative to the
overloading of vessels, and gives un a graphic descrip -
tion of how a steamer bound from Brisbane for Towns-
ville and Thnisday Island was laden on a recent trip.
“ The bolds and ’tween decks were full; on deck, about
30 tons of coal were piled on a whole lot of timber about
3 feet above the railings of the ship from the bridge to
the after-gangway on either side; torwaid of the bridge
on the top of the t beep-pens were several cases of
kerosene piled np as high as possible ; little lurther ou
were some bales of hay, some tons of iron, a lot more
timber, two baggies, a cart, a four-wheeled wagon, and
two horses; cargo was piled np above the fore-cabin
skylight, and aot one inch of the duck was to be seen."
Thu steau er encountered a night gale, and thi,-ped sea
after soa Coals and other cargo were soon all about
the decks ; the forward port gangway was cm rad away
and several tons of cargo with it; the cries of the horses
were most pit’fnl—one horse was washed forward of the
port • angway with bis f en fixed in a hen-coop, while the
other was jambed in against the gailov-door on top of
cooking utensils Bud 1 age cf coal—one had to be shot a
few days after; ml a lot of sheep and poultry perished.
Our correspondent adds that, on the lust trip, tome one
came down and stopped the loading, and a very«omfort-
ab e voyage was made. JNo such stoppage has ever
beture been attempted for over four years, and our cor-
respondent thinka i he bulletin la largely responsible
for it.
POLITICAL POINTS.
Wo want to know at the earliest the names of
the two members of the late Ministry of Corruption in
whose interest a Petersham political dodger bought up
land on the Illawarra railway line.
This is a long Parliament—although it is with-
out a Long. It has the longest member’s roll of any
Australian Parliament; it has the longest members,
there being a dozen over six feet high.
“If I had the power to deal with bad law-
makers and tyrants who persecute people under bad
laws we wonldeoon be without law-makers and tyrants,”
said M E.hone. “Hoar hear," exulticgly ejaculated
air Jack.
The members of the Ute Government are said
to bo decidedly uneasy about tne inquiries as to the
uuauthorbed expenditure of money lor p ctures and
works of an, with which oir 'Enry adorned ins sleep-
ing and jugglery departments,
Sir George Wigram Allen is asking the Govern-
ment what das become of the £2000 for the Glebe Post
Office which waa voted in 1881 Good 1 Voted in 1881!
Why didn’t Sir George ask ms patron. Sir ’Enry Partes?
But, no matter; tho late election has tons id it l.P, Van
Winkle.
T. D. Sullivan, M.P. for Meath, isn’t a bit soared
at the political prosecutions iisoitmed by Mr, Gladstone.
After the proceedings had been started against Michael
Davitt, he endorsed all that that Are -Hand had said at
Navan and strongly advised the Irish to pay their
creditors before paying their rent.
David Buchanan (log.).- “ Desertion number four
(by Mr. Hluart) was tne uust cruel and dishonourable
of all. It consisted of the desertion of Mr. Garrett ”
Why, what more than anything else strengthened Stuart
in the esteem of the country was hi* ma"ly action in
refusing to accept tho alliance of Mr. G .rrott—and
David Buchanan,
The Grey River (N.Z.) Argus speaks of Mr.
Ballanoe as “the Judas Iscariot of tho (d.Z ) House,
who shamelerply sold one party and was kicked d tergo
oat of the other." If wo were in another colony we
could pick out a N.8.W. politician whom the first part
of this description fits, and of whom the second will
probably be true at the earliest opportunity.
“ The baldheaded Ministry” is a fitting title
for the present Administration, as the only members of
it who have not a smooth and shining pate are Mr.
Wright and Mr. Copeland. Everyone cun understand
why G B. Dibbs and J, P, Abbott are baldheadsd.
Because they are constantly brushing cobwebs from
tho ceilings of the houses into which they chance to go.
The Secretary to the Victorian Police Com
mission is “ Little Williams 1 ’—‘ happy-go-lucky"—an
old pressman, who has recently been managing the
Melbourne Age’s telegraphic agency. He has just
earned the uudying hatted of the aigus people for
giving the Age an advance look at the report, and so
enabling it to come out with a leader, giving the cream
some days ahead.
There were only three notable features at tho
opening nf Parliament. The most notable were of
course Parkas’. Then there were the features of the
men who were absent—Woseby, lien wick, Henson,
Watson, &3. The other notable feature was the boa
ounstriotor-like style in which Sir. 'iSnry Parkes put
his saliva over Joe Mitchell—behind a door. Jce
Mitchell was of course as limp as a snail.
Who will say that the Stuart Ministry is not
well constituted? They have an Abbott to provide
their spiritual wants; they can Kaid and Wright; thay
have tho Dibbs, otherwise the Cohen; and it they do
not Dailey it will be a Far.(otf)-nell which will usher
them out of existence. We cannot make anything out
of Jennings—fer the very good reason that he is tot
anything in the Ministry.
At a Cabinet Council, on the 18th, the Govern-
ment withdrew 60 POO aores tbat their predeces-tots had
placed for sale at £l per aore. They likewise withdrew
permanently from sale 870,010 acres of land, which
having been passed at auction, lay ready for the wealthy
land grabber at £1 per acre. Thus, by this one act the
Ministry of notion have saved 930,(00 acres f»r the
people of this country. This is a Uead block to 21 years'
agrarian con option.
The Secularists in Victoria are triumphing in
the cause of education, owing to the differences of the
sectarians. The B.O's will not have the Bible alone in
the Public Schools; they want dogmatic teaching with
it. The Anglican and Presbyterian sections will bo
satisfied with the Bible only. The Secularists are all
the time quietly moulding the young mind of the
country. By and bye", the sectarians will cease to
quarrel—they’ll have nothing to quarrel about.
Among a list of telegrams advertisad in the
Herald, of Saturday, in connection with tho East
Sydney election, there appeared the fallowing “ John
M’Eihone, Esq , M.P.—1 will support Copeland for tho
Upper Hunter.—John Ashford, Senior Constable.'’ This
must be a mistake, or the senior constable is not sham,
as there is a provision in the Electoral Law which
renders a policeman who takes part in an election
liable to a penalty of £100. Policemen act after an
election I
The only member of the Assembly who outraged
the proprieties by appearing in a “ clawhammer " and
white tie, on the morning when tho Governor opened
Parliament, was Mr. Mitchell. The Newtown holy.
J cey looked like a cealheaver dressed in his holiday
suit, but entirely out of his element. He appeared to
ha aa uneasy as a regular down-the-harb mr.pionloker
would have been at the great *’ I Was " banquet, or any
otht r place where there was not plenty of wnolesome
fun—a meeting of the Evangelical Association, for
example.
Up at Tenterfield the other day a meeting waa
held for the purpose of deciding upon the style in which
they should banquet the member for Whereat. Even,
tnally it was decided to feed him in the voluntary sub-
scription mode, the Municipal Council to be requested
“to assist financially,” Mo that the money oi those
who are not Weir-rats is to be partly expended to dq
honour and glory to a burated.up political bladder I
Oh, and Mr C. A. Lee—whoever I;e is—remarked that
it w$s exceedingly condescending of Sir’Enry to accept
Tenterfield as his constituency, “ why, he (Lee) did not
know, but he (Parkes) had no doubt good reasons for
doing so." (I!) “Good reasons?" The very best of
reasons—it was Tanietfleld or oblivion.
David Buchanan must have been dreaming the
other night when he said that the only i ■ finance in the
House was "the power of a-coech—ih j power to pourtray
in vivid language glorious truths, or to denounce
egregious falsehoods " Wall, David has been the prin-
cipal talkar in Parliament for the last twenty years,
and will he venture to say that ho has gained any power
other than that of lung force? The only influence
whieh his efforts has is to excite the risible faculties of
other members, because of the grossly absurd nature of
his utterances, David’s politicq.1 death ought to be a
happy one—be will quit that sphere of disappointments
with the consciousness that ha stands pre-eminent as a
man of consistency—in that he has always been incon-
sistent.
THE SUBSIDING OF SMITH.
Said Sydney Smith to Ninian,
“ I quick will pull your nose 1"
** I’m not of that opinion,
I can tell you,” remarked Ninian,
Who stripped, prepared for blows.
Then speedily did Sydney,
Who Ninian had defied.
Look round and cough uneasily
And sheepishly subside.
The S.M. Herald says a certain Fydney al-
derman exhibited strong partizan feeling in favour of
Mitchell at the Newtown election. This gentleman i*
Mr. Evan Jones, who has been quick to show, in Lis
public career, a thorough turn-coat spirit. Evan
Jones would not have been raised to the •* dignity" of
even a Sydney alderman had it not been that the
progress party—the Australian party—were detarmin .d
to wipe out Alderman Meeks, who, bold anU inde-
pendent in other things, exhibited, at the last moment,
the canker of John Daviesism. Now Evan J >nes has
come out in his true colours, and, at the first chauoe,
gone against the party who delivered him from the
womb of obscurity. It doesn’t take a big hand to span
Evan Jones’s political career.
Mr. Cameron has been again relieved from the
necessity of taking his oari-enter’a kit off the shelf on
which it has rested for three or four years past. The
princely income of £500 is assured to him while ihr
present session lasts, and it is almost a certainty that
he will continue to hold the office of Chairman of
Committees throughout the course of this Parliament.
He had a very “ narrow shave” this time. After the
downfall of the late Speaker, everyone anticipated that
the former Chairman of Committees would be invested
with the ancient order ot the sack. Mr. Tricket.t
would have been elected for a dead certainty, but it is
acknowledged that personal pressure was brought to
boir to induce that gentleman to withdraw from the
contest.
Ihe passage in the Queen's Speech at the proro-
gation of ihe Imperial Parliament, which referred to
Ireland, was eminently characteristic“In some parts
of Iceland l am comp .died to anticipate distress daring
the approaching winter. I have also to record with
d’ep pain that ihe horrible crime of assassination has
been rife in the Metropolitan City of Dublin; and there
is a special call of duty upon the Executive authority
to exercise with fidelity and firmness the powers with
which it-has been entrusted.” The Executive is called
upon to deal with assassinations, but there is no inti-
mation that it should deal with the distress. This
gives, in a nutshell, the gist of the way in which Ireland
is treated by the House of Commons.
Minister for Works, has caused
an additional train to be iun early oa Sunday morning
to the suburban stations, for the convenience of people
who arrive i y the morning steamers. The Minister has
also resolved to lessen the Sunday goods traffic—which
the late Government very strangely allowed greatly to
increase Another boon whiotk Mr. Copeland has con-
ferred on the public is the construction *f waiting,
rooms on the tram lines No other country in the
world would have suffered what the sawdust autocrats
of the late Government forced the Sydney public to

Slid—in the company often of low men and low women

“POOR ARTHUR’S VERY SICK1”

The present Assembly contains about thirty
lawyers, not more than four of whom can impromptu
construct a plain sentence in English without violating
some of the ordinary rules cf grammar, or can speak on
a subject for more than tea minutes without indulging
in tedious repetitions. Unquestionably the lawyers are
the worst speakers in the House, and, as three-fourths
of the orating is done by them, the general character of
the debates is wretched. There was almost an equal
number of lawyers in the last Assembly, yet Uiey
allowed to pass a Licensing Act which i-a so defective
that a coach and fonr can be driven through almost
every section of It For committee work on bills, three
laymen like Mr. Jacob would be better than all the
lawyers pat together. The lawyers are on trial in this
Parliament.
Mr. Garrett did not winoo in the least the other
night—neither did Mr. Parnell—when M Elhone said
that member* who were land agents had betrayed the
trust rtp ised in them to the interests of thieves and
tyrants, but Tom’s “dander” was roused when Mao
said »hat Us was sore because he was not included in
the Mil islry, and that a Government of which hehap-
pened to be a member would not last a week because of
his past conduct With bis accustomed smartness,
the hero of the Milburn Creek business passed off the
little pleasantry by saying that if Mao would make a
substantial chargo against him he would bo prepared to
meet it. As tuuugh in this glorious country, which
prides itself on the purity of its public men, one man
would think of making a substantial charge against
another.
We see that Sir Henry Parkea has decided, so
he informs “E- R. Whereat, Eta., J.p.," by letter, that
he has determined “ to postpose his visit to Tenter-
field,” notwithstanding the fact that “Mr. R. R. C
Robertson, ot Wellington Vale," hid forwarded £5
towards defraying the cost of Sir Henry’s reception.
Now, what can have ooouirsd which induced Sir Henry
to forego the gorgeous treat forescaiowed by the
princely donation of Mr. R. R. Robertson ? Barely no
rumours as to the consignment to Tenter field of a iar g e
quantity of road metal, ojuld have reached the hou.
gentleman I Or could it be possible that Mr. Whereat
wants all the protection the beadle can afford for him.
self, and being uneasy at the prospect of sharing with
Parkes, has persuaded that gentleman not to come up,
and give both ot them an off chance ot falling a victim
to the fury of the populace. By the way, is this muni-
ficent Mr. Robertson a son of taat gorgeous patriot,
Bir John, and brother to that ” noble boy," wh se dis-
interested support of Mr, Watson at Wollongong was
the subject of so mnoh comment? It so, we have hopes
for our country yet!
Lot us handle this canard about Mr. Stuart
and the Banks. Without, drawing upon the reserves of
any secret information we may, or we may not, possess,
we will make two aim)-In quotations fiom Parliamentary
speeches, and leave thin' lug readers to deduce their
own conclusions. David Bu banan—who, like a dingo,
cannot bile, but always snap:.—said; ” Bn me time ago,
the bon, gentleman ooepted thb position of Agent-
G moral. What pi evented his going to England and
fulfilling its duties ? Was it because ho was In the claws
of some monetary institution ? What would people
think if they were represented by a man connected with
snob institutions, and if their chief ruler was in a posi-
tion in which tbese monetary institutions, or some of
them, oonld crush and extinguish him at once.” Then,
Sir John Robertson spoke thus: "No sooner did it be-
come known ia England that the Land Bill had been
rejected than a panic occurred. (Laughter) Hou.
gentlemen might laugh, but they knew that several of
the banka curtailed their advances.” Judging this
canard by these two i pooches, which* bv the way, were
(tin lit'le Kenwiok copied David Buchanan] the only
public utterances bearing upon it. of whom would one
be likely to consider true the charge of being bound
band and foot by theba-ks? Whom should we pick
out as being disabled by this thraldom ? Mr. Btuarb,
who dared to oppose a Land Bill, the r> jectiou of which
canted the banks to put on the screw? Or Bir Joun
Robertson, who brought in a measure, the conditions
ot which he regards as constituting an anti-panio ? Bir
John has given the most complete refutation to the
vapourings of “ blubbering Dave.”
By hia conduct m the Speaker’s chair, Mr.
Barton has already given suffloieut evidence that ha is
the right man in the right pla*e, The robes of honour
have fallen on shoulders which bear them with becom-
ing dignity. In sinking contrast to his predecessor,
Mr Barton does not wait to have his attention directed
tu any transgressions of Ihe rules, but immediately he
finds that a member is going beyond hia rights, ho calls
him to order, and in snoh a respectful yet commanding
way as not to admit of any parley on the point. It
used to be painful to observe the nervous twitching,
and to hear the irapidatory enunciation of the late
Speaker, when, after a member rose to order, and the
point had been amply discussed, he had 1 o give his
ruling. A ruler, to command respect, must make it
oltar that he is conscious he is doing wnatis right, and
mint perform his duty without any flinching. Keen-
nets of perception, a high smsn of honour, and firmness
or purpose, are essential qnallfi-ations with which Mr.
Bariou is endowed in a high degiea.
If any evidence were wanting to show how
small-minded a man Sir George Wigram Aden is, it
would have been furnished in hie nfusal to act as a
member of tbo Elections and Qualifications Committee.
The power to nominate this committee is vested in the
Speaker, and Mr. Barton included Sir George’s name in
the list, but immediately the announcement was made,
the much-disappointed knight informed his successor
that it was not bis pleasure to act on th« committal.
Sir Georg* was quite ready to accept the office to which
a salary of £1200 a year is attached, and he has de-
liberately said that ho is not willing t o act in any other
capacity without pay. “ Yon have refused to have t he
benefit of my knowledge and experience at the usual
price, and I shall take care that you shall not have it
directly or indirectly,” woull be the words which
would have conveyed his thoughts. For the future,
the fallen knight will content himself with questioning
Ministers respecting the requirementscf tin Glebe, and
stating the wishes of the piinoipai prcparty-hoidor
there.
R B. Smith is, wa see, tho same old (or young)
Cupid still. Adveitiring in dear old Gease’e journalistic
model, ho say s“ Again assuring you, (doctors of the
Maokay, that I will visit you when my health is re-
established, and explain any matters whion may be
obscure or unsatisfactory to some of you Finally, I
congratulate you on the orderly manner in which the
election has been conducted.” This is all very well;
but his absence is alleating tho well-being of the
district. Since Mr. Smith duserted the bays, they have
been going about docking all the horses’ tails. The
outrage coming on tep of the dastardly crime of putting
■alpetre in Mr. Oease’s sulphur bath is calculated to
arouse in many minds a feeling of grave uneasiness.
We trust K. B will take this hint and get well as soon
as he can. Tho effrot of his arrival wo understand is
magical. A travelling circus follows him all the way
up on purpose to pirform “ und-'r his patronage,” and
while he is at Ksmpsey there is quite a run on clean
socks and shilling books of etiquette. They will listen
to him for hours ; so it will be seen that though they
ill-treat the horses, they never evince any anxiety to
dock the tale of E. B. Smith.
We met Renwiok on hia way home after the
declaration of the poll. His mouth worn a smile, but
the glare in his eyes showed that ha was running a 41-
horse-power engine to keep that smile in working order
—till ho got home. Little Arthur’s smile atfeoted us
so much that we at once sat down on a seat beside an
old warder, who was preparing to camp for the night,
and with all the enthusiasm of <s spring poet, jotted
down our multitudinous feelings.—
The poll was over i homo they went,
A little hand,
Wearing an air of discontent:
Yet one was bland.
The doctor was put in the hole
By quite a pile.
Bat yet, with iron in his soul,
He tried to smile t
The shameful, slanderous, " atheist” cry
Did not avail j
The baseless “Chinese labour” lie
Was raised—to fail j
No secret stab to wound a MAN
Was thought too vile ;
Yet still this little creature can
Fnt on a smile 1
Tbs workings of the Orange clique.
The bigot crew,
Tho petty spite they tried to wreak—
Ail would not do :
Sectarian hatred filled the air,
And pious guile—
This whipper-snapper yet can wear
A togut smile I
Yes, home they travelled through the park.
All ciushed again—
Chair engineering in the dark
Had been in vain.
To salts and senna, ipecac..
And camomile, *
Poor little Pill-box njust go back
With sorry smile 1
The Premiers of South Australia and Victoria
are disputing over an insignificant strip of land. When
ihe Border lino between tbo two colonies was first
agreed r.ivon, the boundary was suppoted to be settled
at the 14Ut meridian. Subsequent surveys showed
that a mistake had primarily been ma.de in Victoria’s
favour. In consequence of some technicality, this laud
cannot be taken over forcibly by Mouth Australia.
Victoria, for its part, won’t willingly part with it.
booth Australia, having any quantity—rather too
much —of territory, is not at all uovitous of toe strip
in question; but the obstacles continually thrown in
the way of a settlement by Victoria have even pre-
vented its cession to that colony by South Australia.
Victoria won’t take as a favour what it regards as a
right. Legally considered, this strip of country is,
theref ore, a No-Man’s Lmd. A lawyer will tell you
that, if a man committed murder within its limitr,
neither Victoria nor South Australia would legally
have jurisdiction over him, and that, if the proper
machinery of the law were put into motion, the mur-
derer mast escape the consequences of his crime.
When Charles Mann, Q.C.—and one of the ablest and
moat astute lawyers iu South Australia, of which, by
the way, he is a native —waa Treasurer of that colony,
and W. H. Sunday, Q C., was Attorney-General, it waa
actually serion>-ly suggested that an agent should be
employed to start an illicit whisky still in No-Man’s-
Laud, so as to provoke prosecution on the part of the
Victorian Government. Toe South Australian Gov-
ernment waa then to supply the funds necessary to
carry the case to the Privy Council, so as to get the
matter decided once for all. The suggestion waa not
adopted beoau.-e it was considered too undignified tor
a Government to play the part of (ly-giog manufac-
turers. Sir Bryan O’Loghieu is just as stubborn for
Victoria as all his predecestors have bean, and tells
Mr. Bray, the South Australian Premier, that there is
no case to submit to the Privy Council. Both he and
Bray are lawyers, and of about the same calibre—third
or fourth raters, though shrewd politicians. The
outcome of the preaeat negotiations is that the South
Australian vtewo are to be formally submitted to the
Viotoriau Cabinet, and a reply given, when the whole
of the correspondence will be forwarded to England.

So Prince Jerome has issued tv manifesto, and
has dropped into it. We knew this Prince Jerome when
he woe living at the Palais Koyalo during the days of
the Second Empire. We don’t know whether he knew
us; but, let’s say h? did. Jerome is a remarkable man,
and, what naturally follows, an eccentric. His equipages
were one of the “sights" of Paris—all his carriages
being drawn by Normandy horses of a peculiar breed,
and his postilions dressed in the huge jack-hoots and
picturesque costume of the old mail-drivers, A poou-
liarity about the horses was that they always hud theiv
tails tied up, and their enormous sise waa proverbial.
The Prince and the Emperor wore seldom on friendly
terms, the former being but seldom taken into the
Imperial councils, while such butterflies as Lobceuf and
Boutbaki wore always consulted. Tne Prince is enor-
mously wealthy, and, like the Emperor of Kusala, has
deposited the bulk of his wealtu in the Bank of Eag.
land.
This is a pleasing anecdote about the unas-
suming early days of a noble knight who is now living
at home, and giving dinners to the shady sec ion of the
anstoooaoy for the benefit of London satirists. Hj
was, was this Luoullus, tar back in the lustrous long
ago, a plain, moleskin-trousered, orimean-shirted,
bluohar-booted bush labourer, who was glad enough
work for his brother for •* tucker." It was at this time
that a friend of his, who waa in the Civil service, re-
vealed to him the particulars of a capital laud specula-
tion which both could go into with advantage if the
future millionaire could find half the money necessary.
The future millionaire) said ho would think of it. When
the friend came round again, he was informed that the
speculation was not considered good enough. But
when, after hunting about for a week, he at last dis-
covered a man who was willing to go into the thing
with him, you will have no diflioulty in believing
was mad when he found that the future millionaire and
his brother had bought up the land several before.
(Such was the start in life of one of our Bftoat ?epre.
sentative " self-made " men. Which reminds us that
we have ntticod that most men who themselves
are usually very bad workmen.
H. B. Lee, the business philanthropist of Sydney,
is dead. His gif o to posterity in this city is the Soap
Kitchen, the home of loafers and scheming vagabonds.
This Soup Kitchen is daily creating a pauper class —*
sneaking, greasy, praise- God sort of pauper-not uaeof
whom nee.il beg a day without work if he eonght it.-
H. B Lee was the genuine type of business philau,
thropist. His earlier reports, which weye swallowed
by the “ goody-goody" with annual regularity,
abounded in all the stereotyped scriptural expressions,
letters from reformed people, and BQ on. Lee boldly
stated in one report that among the inmates was one
who had been an attendant on Boyalty. Several mem-
bers of Parliament bad sought refuge, he said, but n ■»
a: tempt had been made to keep count of the editors
and reporters who had "received comfort and susten-
ance." The whale thing was exposed, jet the swindle
has been continued. It was hinted that all the contri-
butions didn’t go to tho inmates. Apparently, there
wasn't a i-ingle dr-'p of warm olood in Tito's body—all
pure business. He had a huxe hump between his
shoulders (U. B. Lee), and bis face at any t ime was as
cheerless as a winter's blast. The old felljw is dead
now. We wonder who’ll run bis show. It is significant
that tho Shroud has a paragraph on him. Ah 1 you,
indeed, have lost a friend! Leo was just the sort of
man who would like the Shroud ; he’s quite wrapped up
in it now.
Nowhere perhaps has the dentist’s art obtained such
high excellence as in Sydney. Certainly wa are in no
sense behind any other city. Visitors to Sydney might,
to test this, visit the establishment of Messrs. Adolphe
Gabriel and Company, 18, Wyuward Square, two doors
from Pfahlert’s Hotel. Hera the manufacture of every
essential In the profession is carried on. At tho rear of
tho surgery is a compact little factory where all tho
requisites for supplying every dental defeet in tho
human mouth are made. Messrs. Gabriel and Co.
(whose only address U os above) are always pleased fM
show their specimens of artificial teeth to thOPU
interested. There being two firms of the same VAme in

Tom Cannon’s stable has a great name in South
Africi. Owing to the repeated victories of Buxton, a
horse bred by Cannon, the Gold Cup of 1G0 boys., with

Africa, has been altered to a handicap. Buxton has
won eight consecutive races.

The Liverpudlians are determined to get up a
big thing in race meetings this year, and tneir pro-

not mean to take a back seat to Parramatta. There are
millions to be given away in prizes, and Mr. G. N. Bull,
the Mayor and secretary, vows he will have half Sydney

The Liverpool, (Eng.), Grand National Steeple-

Sport in Amerikay. The Cricket and Athletic
Club held a series of games on Barrack-square, St.
John, N.B , Nov 9. The gates were guarded by police-
men, but a number of roughs got into the grounds
over the fences. While the games were in progress
these renghs cut the ropes and poured into the field.
The officers could not drive them back, and, there being
no ropes with which to keep the crowd out of the way
of the contestants, the committee decided to stop the
sports.
It is settled that Iroquois is to remain in Eng-
land for the present. Mr. Lorillard says ho lefr. it to
Tom Cannon's judgment whether or not he could be
trained, and we believe o R nnon desires to train him for
his engagement in the rich Hardwick Stakes, at At cot,
in June next Cannon has expressed the highest a<1-
miration for the Derby winner, saying that, in his
judgment, the colt has never vet shown the extent of
his abilities, which is no slight praise, coming, as it
does, from the jockey of Isonomy and Robert the Dsvil.
The Athletic "Reunion at the Melbourne Town
Hall, in aid of the Creewiek Relief Fund, was by far
the best thimr of tb“ sort ever done in Australia. The
lads of the Tarn Verein opened the ball with some
clever gvmnastio feats, but soon made wav for Miller
and Victor, who di 1 some statuesque wrestling.
Christie and Hioken then had a bout with the
“mittens.” and retired amidst a burst of applause
Miller, Victor, and Graham did some heavy weight
lifting, the Professor finishing up by lilting 1921b
weight high above his head.
The scratching of Thebaia led to a severance of
the partnership between the Dowager Duchess of
Montrose and Sir George Chetwynd, the latter of whom
has seceded from the Bedford Lodge stables, taking the
trainer with him to the Nunnery Stables, formerly
the property of Mr. Henry Saville. 'Jhe Dowager
Duchess retains, however, the confidence of her hus-
band and of Sir John Astley, and under her masterful
manageme it their horses will still be trained at Bedford
Lodge, a venturesome man named Arnull having stepped
into the place left vacant by Sherrard.
At a six days go-as-you-please, Mew York, U S.,
Rowell, who is considered invincible at this sport,
broke down utterly, through an affection of the heart,
and Hazael, like Rowell, an Englishman, who had pre-
viously accomplished 600 miles in six days, was in but
little better condition. The distances and times made
by the contestants were as follows:—P. J Fitzgerald,
577 miles 440 yards, 141h 43m : G D. Noroman, 566
miles 880 yards, Itlh 42 n ; D J Hertv, 541 miles 220
yards, 14lb. 45m ; J Hughes 525 miles 170 yards, 14 )h.
56m.; F. H Hart, 482 mile* 600 yards, 122h. 35m 45s.;

Says the N.Y, Spirit op the Times: “ We
have now in our possession a hammer frequently used
at sports, and certified to as 141b, which actually
weighs 111b. ISJoz.; and another, thrown for years as
161b , which weighs only 131b. Itoz The 561b. weight
used by G. Dwison, at Montreal, P.Q , two years ago,
when ho made the alleged nerformacoj of 27 feet, only
weighed 48lb. In fact, a Caledonian hammer, shot, or
561b. weight, of exact weight is a great rarity. Add to
this the fact that, with one or two exceptions, all
grounds used for these sport* in America are more or
less down hill, and it is not bard to understand why the
performances made under such circumstances should
be rejected by men who assori and winnow athletic
records.
Gilbert Watson Patrick, the famous American
jockey, who was universally known as Gilpatriok.
caught cold at a ieoent J< rorae Park m* eting and died
after a short but severe attack of pneum inia. During
his nearly fifty years on the turf. Qilpatrick made over
3000 mounts, and was winner in three fourths of these—
a record equalled by no jockey that ever lived. He won
over two millions of dollars in stokes for race-horse
owners; yet he died in want of the absolute: necessaries
of life, after having vainlv appealed to those for whom
he had won thousands. Ho was torn of English parents
at Fishkill Plains, Duchess County, near Pougbkoepie,
U.8., in 1817. He rode his first race when he was only
fourteen years old, and his last at Brighton Beaoh in
1879, when ho was over 62 years of age.
The Victorian Club’s second race meeting took
place on Saturday, and was a success only so far as the

many thought it a dead heat, but the judge gave it in
favour of The Plunger. Selling Race : Robert the Devil

At Christchurch, N.Z , the proprietor of Hobbs
and Goodwin s totalisator wire sued for £111s. by the
holder of a ticket on which payment had been refused
at the last C J.C. races. The ticket was unstamped,
and defendant said it was impossible to issue an un-
stamped ticket. On th« day in question the wind had
blown a number of unstamped tickets on the grass.
The money and tickets registered exactly corresponded,
leaving plaintiff ont of the calculation, and the info*,
enoe, of course, was that plaintiff had never paid for
his ticket in the usual way. The magistrate sided with
defendants, and gave judgment for them. It appeared
that Plaintiff had not got the ticket himself, but gave
his £1 to another man to get it for him, and the latter
obtained one for himself also, giving plaintiif the un-
stamped one.

In the second International cricket match, com-
menced in Melbourne last Friday, the “ Blarsted
Britishers” had their revenge and something to spare,
as they won by one innings and 27 rune The English-
men commenced to bat on a grand wicket, stayed in all
day. and made 248 for the lose of s»ven wiokets Their
innings finished for a total of 201 The Australians
made a poor stand, and were all disposed of for 114 A
couple of light showers fell during the day, but not
sufficient to make any diiferenoe in the result. Bates’
bowling was next to unplayable; he took three wickets
in three consecutive balls, and seven wiokets for 28
runs. This is teaching the C-loniala something. The
Australians lollowed on their innings, and made a total
of 153 runs. Bates secured seven wiokets for 74 runs.

At a meeting held last Friday night, the officers
in connection with the Woolloomooloo Rowing Club
were elected, and. under tho able Captaincy ot Mr.
Jack Myers, the affair ought soon to be in full swing.
It is time we had another good club t o liven ap amateur
rowing, which is at a very low ebb in Sydney, judging
from the miserable entries for the National Regatta.
Aquatics must be in much the same state in Tasmania,
as " Cerberus," in the Tasmanian Mail, says:—"I’ll
stake my existence that if the Committee, instead of
giving money prizes, wore to place tronhies in thtir
stead, they wouldn’t have a single entry for an amateur
racs ’’ As our regattas will not All up for trophy races,
the Rowing Association might wed take into conaidoi a-
tion the advi B ability of altering their rules, to allow of
amateurs rowing for money prizes. Had the National
Regatta races been for "hard cash," we feel satiefi.d
there would have been a surfeit of entries.
“ The improvements that have of recent years
shown themselves in Rugby football, as played by the
drat rank of players, are something very remarkable.
Now the ponderous heavy weight, whose sole mission
was to push, and who was chosen into a team for the
amount of supeifluous flesh ha carried, is no more
tolerated: in a word, brute force has given Way before
the introduction of skill. Forward players hava now to
be nimble dodgers and expert dribblers, instead of mere
pushing machines. The effect of these changes will be
shown—in all probability as early as next season—by
the adoption of a round ball, in place of the long oval
article now in use. with which it is quite impoaainle to
dribble with anything approaching certainty. When
the round ball is introduced into the Rugby game we
may expect that to alter still more in character, and
the cry will be even more than it now is : Dribble when
the ball is going wlih you ; pick it up when it Is coming
against you." Thus the .London World.
The quarrels between her Grace of Montrose
and Mr. Stirling Crawfurd of the one part, and
Sherrard the trainer, and various more or less im-
portant employes ot Bedford Lodge, of the other, arose
through private information having been afforded to
Walton, the plunger, daring his flrnt and moat success-
ful visit to England, During the time that Walton was
winning large sums of money it was wondered how ho
could obtain the " tips " which he undoubtedly did
obtain about certain norses, and all sorts of rumours
were abroad, not only as to what Walton did and said,
but as to what was said and done by those who oon.
sidered themselves injured by his successes. The now
historical quarrel between Walton and Sir John Astley
arose out of Walton’s having received information
which should not have been accorded an outsider—in-
formation which prevented the burly baronet get ing
nearly so good a price about his horse as he should
have had, because of the foresiailing which resulted
from it.
The recent rubber between W. G. George and
L. E. Myers resulted in a victory for the Englishman,
who won the last two events. In the first race—half,
mile —Myers, when four yaida from the finish, threw
his arms erect abovo his head, and breasted the tape
nine feet in front of his rival. George took the lead in
the second event —one mile - and led the Ameriaanfrom
start to finish, winning by twenty yards, with enough
‘‘go’’ left in him to out down the figures had the neces-
sity arisen. The times returned for every twelfth of a
mile were as follow i One, 20 sec.; two, 40 sac.; three,
1 min. H sec. j four (one lap), 1 min. 23see.; five, 1 min.
45 sec.; six (one half mile), 2 miu. St see. j seven, 2 mm

in which George ran a mile in 4 min. 19 3 5sec , in Jane
last he covered ore third of a mile in I min. 17* eei.;
half-mile, 2 min. 4* sec. ; and three-quartern. 3 min
8 3 5 sec The winner’s tunes from two-thirds of a mile
are now tho fasto-t on rerord in America,. Tee
third event was a grand race. The man jumped away
to a good start, G ior*e setting the pace at his best.
Myers running level with him for a short distance and
then falling in behind. At the end of a quarter-mile,
the leader s time was 1 miu 125 sec, Myers 1 mm.
1* reo At the half-mile, exiotly the same distance
separated them—George’s time being 2 min. 2i sec.
Myers here made a great rush, and draw up
to tho Englishman’s shoulder; but George responded,
gradually ino eased his lead, and eventually won a grand
race by 5 yards, in 3 min. 10* sec. A splendid per-
formauoe, taking into consideration a heavy wind and
bad track. It was s ated M. ers was not in good oondit ion,

SOCIAL
There’s a custom that for tho world we wouldn’t
see abolished. That is, making every bride an Annt
Sally. When a young lady is unfortunate enough to
get married, it’s really a most delicate and pleasing
mark of sympathy for friends and relatives to pelt her
with rice, wheat, slippers, and suoh missiles as they can
readily catch on to. Otherwise, she might doubt they
loved her. The other day, at Brndigo (V.), au effeo-
tionate boy tendered a departing bride a mark of his
esteem. He tendered it with a blneher boot; and he
dexterously put the mark in the middle of her face.
The lady, instead of being gratified by such a hearty
expression of good wishes, fainted; and a crimson creek
cascaded from her nose, and formed an arabesque design
on her bridal satin. As soon as the bridegroom had
carried her into the house, he strolled out, and casually
looked round. But the affectionate boy bad left.

Splendid weather on Saturday drew numbers to
harbour, and boats were fl'led going in all direction'.
An agreeable anting wai enjoyed by some members of
the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron and their friends,
who went in the Agenoria to see the 9-ton yacht eon-
test for Commodore Knox’s prize. About 50 were in
the party, including a coterie of ladies. A brisk race
was won by the lone, the Plfalos second. Another
exounion was that of the Rovers O.C , postponed from
the previous wet Saturday. All lively young people
they were, to the number of 200, who took a band with
them down to the Avenue, and danoed until nearly sun-
down. The girls wore those nice sateens that won't
soil, or that mother can easily “ run through the tub”
if they do; and each girl hod a big hat aud a beau. No
sooner had this giddy boatload left than our gallant
Torpedo Corps appeared in full uniform They want
over to Borrv’s Bay and had a rei ular gun-cotton picnic
A few Wolverene men and other visitors went with
them, and notwithstanding that the Majah commanded,
every one sot home safely. The Atlas O.C , also had a
picnio, to Tennyson, but their tickets were only eighteen-
penoe; and we’d no more dream of going to an eighteen
penny picnio than of riuing in a Waterloo tram.

*’Langtry,” says Clara Belle, “has grown
thin since the familiar portraits, exposing taper arms
and a bonsless bosom, were made, and she made no ex-
hibition of those things, nor is she likely to, during her
American tour. She is a large-j ointed woman, with big
hands, and her elbows are larger than the parts of her
arms between them and the shoulders, as was plainly
disclosed by the tight sleeves of her costumes. No ;
she will bare no suoh arms as she now possesses, believe
me. Only one of her dresse-* was low, and that ex-
Sosed only a wedge ot skin down the centre ot her
reast. This garment was ©f rich, warm-toned yellow
satin, simple in style, and fitting perfectly. The
waist was heart-shaped, coming low down on the
shoulders, and beneath the frill of point-lace, which
circumscribed the fleshly area to the narrow limits
a’rcady described, was only a piece of lightly twisted
sat ; n 'o’lowing its outlines. The corsage simply car-
ried the line below the waist, and ended in small points.
Bh»doe» notout, sain, and spoil good stuff with shirrs,
puffs, and bias bends, as ie the fashion with Ameri-
can dressmakers However, this plainness is artful
instead of saving in her, for it suits her individuality.
Simplicity is her strong point. la all of her dressing
she wsg oareful to show the outlines of her waist,
which is slender, and, to my mind, rather out of pro-
portion with her broad shoulders and ample hips. The
idea sugge-tel by her figure was not of fleshy round-
ness at the two wide parts mentioned, but of a big-
boned frame not smoothly filled out. This impression
was strengthened by the visible action of her shoulder-
blades under the thin covering and above the top of her
corset, as well as by the tneagreness of her bosom I
fancied that she was about seven-eighths bone, with a
wiry extensive month. Having expressed that horrid
idea, I must not fail to do the woman justice by saying
that, as an entirety, she is about ns wholesome, healthy,
olean-looking a creature as one oould wish to see. She
walked with a stride that indicated a sturdy pedestrian,
and, altogether, she had more ont-door breeziness than
one would expect in a dainty drawing-room pet,”

Captain Stewart and officers of the Loch Etive
gave o. dance on board last Thursday. Vessel decked
with fl vgs aud lanterns, and the colored lights and skil-
fully draped banting, made a picturesque ballroom.
Musicians were cloistered in a corner, and kept excellent
time till half-past one, by whioh hour fully twenty
dances had been performed ; and a good supper was an
additional attraction, topped up of course with speeches.
A Maitland lady in white and pale blue, and a graceful
glider in black and cardinal, dwell especially in our
memory.

At the opening of Parliament, the Council Cham-
ber was crowded by ladies as usual; one or two gentle-
men endeavoured to edge in, ostensibly to protect their
fair frien Is, but they were politely invited to retire.
Among the favoured ones who remained were Lady
Innos, in quiet blaok costume trimmed with jet; Lady
Jennings, somewhat similarly attired; Miss Mary
Stephen in floelle, and Langtry bonnet; Mrs. C. M O.
Roberts, in brown pompadour: Miss Roberts; Miss
Smith (from over the way) in a pink dress, white lace
and pink head dress; M~s. Cecil Griffiths, dainty in
white muslin; Miss M’Elhone, in palest blue figured
nun’s veiling; Mias Carroll, cream moirii antique sitin,
and white lace hat; and Mrs. Stewart, who like others
dressed with quiet simplicity. The ceremonies did not
differ from the general routine, and at their conclusion,
the assemblage soon dispersed.

AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
CANTO I. (Continued.)
CLVII.
“ I’m horribly ent up—I never meant to
Come here at all—I don’t know how I came ;
I had some drinks ; I think they must ’a went to
My head; «o you can see I’m not to blame.
And, as for Jenny, why she’s cant, per cent, too
Stuck up for me ; stuck up is not a name
Fer what she is 1 do believe she fannies
No girl bat she one solitary chance hai.
CLVilX.
“If she’d a thonsmd pound for every acre
I wouldn’t have her, though I string her on ;
(She almost asked mo but last night 4o take her—
I may he soft, but I’m not that far g-me)
If you'll but marry me, oh 1 won’t it make her
Grate her buck teeth with rage, to think upon
The way she’s euchred—and give me this credit,
I’ve always lovei you, ihough I haven’t said it.”
CLIX.
Th« usual way, dear girls. It often vexes
Mr steadfast soul to see the shameless way
In which the worst aud coarsest of the sexes
Deludes the gentlest with words sweat to say.
And sweet to heir; bnt Love a fickle Rex is.
Whose kingdom changes neirly every day.
And no town constable need ever think to
Tell lies with him Dan Cu; id tips the wink to.
c. x.
But Harry’s words wore meant as wholly truthful.
Just then he loved her more than words oould tell;
Hia heart was ardent and his blood was youthful.
And she was fair, and well-to-do as well.
And, though at times he felt quite soft and ruthful.
He didn’t soem to care what woe befel
The girl whom, but the previous night, he treasured.
And loved with love unbonndad and unmeasured.
CLXI.
And Susan PflWell, she’d won the stake she played
(or.
When first she saw through Harry’s big mistake;
Tb>a was the oonsu nnmUoa she had prayed for
Fall many a night, when, tearful and awake.
She thought that Jenny Mason wasn’t made for
The bashful shearer, for whote dating sake
She pined in secret, and whose ntmi, when chalked
on
The slate, she kissed, and loved the gronud he
walked on.
CLXII.
But she bad no Intention to surrender
Without some show of anger. ’I hough her eyes
Laughed out with joy, her voice far from tender.
As she replied: “Yes I wouldn’t it be nice
To find a man who hasn’t g->t a bender.
Besides being full of drunkenness and vi®©.
Coiled up in one’s beat bed—a real Three-S ar man.
And marry him right eff and make him barman.
CLXIII.
11 It might be batter—people couldn’t tattln
It we were married, as they will do now;
Besides, you oould attend tho sheep and cattle.
And keep the farm right—tell roe, can you plough P
Last thrashing-time I went through suoh a battle
To get the work done that I made a vow
To marry someone for no -ther reis n
Than to have quiet in the harvest season.
CLX1V.
“ But why do I delav ? You two-faced bound, you—
Yon think to talk mo over, but you’ll not
(Why oau’t you keep the counterpane aiomd you P
You shameless reprobate) You care a lot
For me. (I think they told roe. for a pound y ou
Can get spliced quietly by V irson 'cott;
To-day he’s here. If 'Lcna’d mind the bar, I’d
Take this chance and get securely married).
CLXV,
“ O, Harry, 'twos a monstrous thing to fetter a
Disgrace on me"—You know, dear boys, as well
As I do —and, no doubt, you know it better, a
Great deal—what followed ; so I needn't dwell
On all she said ; but give tho poor type-setter a
Short chance t- draw his breath. Enough to tell
That, after tears hysterical and kisses.
He made her reconciled to be his missis.
CLXVI.
And then advised her just to take the key with
Her, so securing him till dewy ove
Should bring the Beverend Baott, the Baptist, tea
with,
Who came to preach Salvation, and receive
The net proceeds. Which she did quite agree with ;
The more as she oould hardly yet believe
In his sincerity—it seemed so risky
To trust a conquest won on country whisky.
CLXVII.
So, leaving him, she went and told Selina
The whole occurrence, who was much amazed;
But quite agreed with her that there could bo no
Course wiser to adopt, and shyly praised
Her Finger, hinting, too, that she oould see no
Sufficient reason, when leva’s fliaie was raised
Between two people, why they shouldn’t marry—
Now praising Teddy—now excusing Harry.
CLXVI1I.
And 8us»n, plainly seeing what she sighed for.
Thought— ’• Well I why shouldn’t she be happy too P
I know that plenty other girls have tried for
This chap of hers, and couldn’t put him through.
He’s strong and young, and able to provide for
Mv sister. Yes. I think we’ll make it do.
We’ll both get wed at one® —that notion nice is,
And I will make old Scott reduce his prices."
CLXIX.
Thus it was settled, and the Singer sent for
Who came betimes, and all was soon put right,
Aud Jiao, the barman, with sealed orders, went lot
Some goods essential to the festive night.
Th ; s is the note he bore —it wasn’t meant for
The vnlgar gaze, but I take much delight
In making public things to greatly shook you meant.
So here’s the genuine authentic document
CLXX.
“ Dear Sir; i take my pen to rite yon hoping
That you are wel as i am now thank God
i hope this envelope can’t bee got open
i can’t trust jim he’s such a peifect fraud
i want yen when you send the box of sope in

“ both me and lena will be spliced at sunset
Come i( you can, we’ll have a spree at night

ot dabble sheets, and send some crockery white
new it you've got it not a cracked half-done set
like what you sent before. Selina n ight
rundown this evening about six in o»so i
want any other thing—yours Susan laoey,"
clxxn.
And the long day drew on, and night came a’owly.
And, ere the night, a gentleman in blaok,
Whose mien was healthful, reverent, and holy.
As one who never knew the sordid lack
Of fcnokrr; who tried hard to look most lowly,
With well-filled belly and with well-clothed back—
This was the Minotaur who meant to grapple
That night with Satan in the Baptist Chapel.
CLXI1II,
Him soon they settled with, and, being ready.
They all repaired at once to Snsan’s room.
Where Harry sat despondent on the bed he
Had last night captured, waiting for his doom,
Selina went np first, along with Teddy,
Whose hair was sleek with unguent and perfume;
Then Susan led her captive to the daughter
(She’d given him all that day no drink but water).
CLXX1V.
** So these were wed, aud merrily rang the bells," as
He sings who sang ttae “Idylls of the King,"
But I cannot endorse the tale he tells, as
In this wild place there wore no bells to ring;
• Bnt through the night came sounds as much like
Hell’s as
A drunken shearer’s who essays to sing,
Commixed with sounds of “insult, rage, and wrong,”
and
Deoiled blows delivered by some strong hand.
CLXXV.
And, when the reverend wrestler gave the devil
Some biotfalls, at the tea-fight down the road.
The latter, seeing they oould whip him level,
Threw np the sponge, and took up his abode
Within the “ Farmers’ Arms,” and led the revel
Thr >ugn one wi.d night while blood and whisky
flowed,
And never since has b:en a friendly shedding
U( ilo-dto ma.ih whit graced the double wedding.
CIXXVI.
And, all this while poor hopeful Jenny waited
For her false lover In her lonely home,
Unknowing what had been and what was fated
To follow after, throngn the years to come;

The Lost of the Litt e Medicine Man.
Tuesday afternoon. We are in Hyde Park
under the hustings. The crowd is broken np into little
knots. Hmali man with thin faces pud huge hats stand
in the middle of each of these aui ■ xp aia the whole
thing. Small men usually m <k i the best politicians,
because if they oau’t come out at the large they can
alwa„ s wriggle through the lulle end of the horn. For-
tunate y, Dr, Benwiok is a small man.
* * •
Scattered thh u 3 h the crowd are numerous
sp< cimeusof the Ausualtau type of physique Scattered,
mind you. The crowd has a face of its own —a face of
heavier mould and firmer lives than the fine-cut face of
the native. Ev.deutiy there is here a predominance of
the exotic over the Indigenous element. But all have
one purpose—all 1 •
* • •
Not quite, but nearly. Look at those phantoms
diving iu ana out among the trees. They listen to
everything but say nothing. There is an unfamiliarity
about their appearance, a suspiciousness about their
slouch wmoh marks them out as aliens from the start
And very ugly aliens they are. One of them comes out
into the sunitgh', and simultaneously a shiver seems to
run through the crowd. Each man there is conscious
of the approach of sema hing unholy—something that
whoever meets ihculd button up his pockets and spit
upon the ground. Let us look at the fearsome oreatnre.
He is dressed in black clothes — typical of the
colour of ) is heart. A broaen-brimmed blaok hat
covers bis Neverduthat skull. Large tufts of red hair
fall over his satyr ears. The hue of his hair, combined
with the blood-shot tinge in the corner of his corpse-
like eyes, give one the impression that at one time
somebody dropped him heud-flrst into a tub of gore,
and that the colour has not faded out yet. Yon would
not say that hu had a human (ace it you looked at him
—you would say that someone had drawn the skin of a
duck’s foot over the skull of a cave-age murderer, and
set it np for scorn on the body of a gorilla. You think
we are exaggerating ? We are not. This man is a
representation of the most hideous bead of the hydra
of Bigotry—urangeism.
• • #
He slinks stealthily about in tho crowd, like a
jackal through' the vaults of dry boms. In and out he
worms his way, until he can find a man as mean-looking
as himself. He finds him out, and whispers huskily
into the funnel he calls bis car, “ Where is John
Davies ? ” Alas I John Davies is dead. He mast be
dead, for this is the first election he has missed f.r
fifteen years—dead, or hiding in a hat-factory.
• • «
Suddenly a wild hurrah rises from a thousand
throats. Tna while headed Returning-Officer has com*
out on the hustings. Copeland is conqueror by 1515
votes. Who are tne 1387 men who voted for Benwiok ?
They are the bitter-blooded bigot, the foreign fanatic,
and the dead. They are the total strength of the Bolt
Howl, the Bum, and the Evening A hike. Benwiok
stands up to speak. His voice is shrill and melancholy
as the voice of a soreeeh-owl in the mouldy tombs
His face is like the face of one who sees his appointed
place in hell in a dreadful dream. “ One day you w J1
call me t© the House," is hie final shriek. “Yea, to
tho dead-house,** eays a man behind. Aad then the
poor little medicine-man crashes bis hat over his beat-
ing brow, and plunges down from the platform. Cope-
land is carried away on the shoulders of the white men
who voted (or him. Renwick has to walk—there ie no
shutter handy. The enthusiastic electors propose to
pat M’Elhone on tho pedestal meant for the Queen’s
statue. He declines. Let them put np John Davies, if
they can find him—the sight of him will, as that of the
Brazen Serpent did of old, cure madness—the madness
of suoh electors as voted tor the Benegade.
• • •
■While Levien is speaking from the balcony of
the Oxford Hotel, which is graced by the suueet visage
and shining shirt-front of Zulu Thompson, a rod-headed
maniac starts to harangue the crowd from a cart. His
gestures are Demosthenic. He is either a born orator,
or he is drunk. The popular impression seems to be in
favour of the latter supposition, and bis little hash is
soon settled. A qmn with Ajax shoulders crashes his
way through the crowd, and, patting one foot on the
axle, coolly takes this Lioero of the mud-cart by the
hair and draws him out, as one would draw a periwinkle
out of its shell with a pm, over the back-board, kicks
him once or twice for luck, and then slings him eut into
the crowd. A hundred horny hands are instantly
doubled up—we hear one or two stifled cries, and all is
over. When the crowd went away we looked for traces
of him between the ohinks of the paviqg.Btones, but
there were none. There was not stamina enough in
him to make even a grease-spot.
Tha crowd slowly clear off. Two or three men
with hang-dog faces still slink around. They are Rp

WOMAN ITEMS.
A contemporary mentions with some surprise
that “in 1881 only 5532 out of 119,000 females in Vu>
toria ready to be married, entered the bonds of matri-
mony.” No necessity for wonder. The married trac-
tion were orphans, the remainder had mothers.
It is alleged that the cause of Mrs. Dr. Seguin
recently killing her children and then herself, in New
York, was the atheism of her husband; that it had been
the dream of tier life to convert him, and failing, she
thought her course was the only one left to save the
children from his influence.
A niece ot the late M. Gambetta is a very pro-
mising danseuse, and has secured an engagement at a
London music hall. She belonged to an unsuccessful
branch of the family, aud her uncle entirely ignored
her, eo she adopted the stage as a profession. This
neglect of poor relations Is very French. While
Thiers was President of France, his sister kept a
wretohed little oookshop. He was too many tiers above
her to recognise an eating-house keeper, so she“8hed
tears brotherlessly.
When Mademoiselle Duverger was playing in
Paris once, a gentleman asked another how old she
was. Ot course, she wasn’t old at all; he meant how
young—but never mind. " She is now twenty-one, for
the third time,’’ was tho neat reply. Mademoiselle
was smart herself once. When she was about 21 for
the first time, a sucking suitor brought her two poems
he had made to her eyebrows, and implored her to
aooept which she liked best. She read one, and then
planting the other, unread, in her pocket, she said
sweetly, “ Je piofere 1 autre." (“ 1 prefer the other,")
A young lady in Balolntha (N Z.), charged a
young man with having shot at her with intent to kill her,
the other day. When the ease was called, there was no
prosecution. Acting under their counsel s advice, it
appears the respective patties settled the matter by
going out and getting married on the t pot. Probably
the young lady considered that by adopting this latter
course h®r revenge would ba surer. Or was it that tho
lawyers had advised them to do this with a view to get-
ting a retainer in a profitable divoroe suit P Anyhow,
the m ra’.—for young men only—is, whenever you make
up your mind to shoot, shoot straight.
An amusing case was tried at Brighton (Eng.)
Plaintiff claimed 13s. for making a dress. Defendant
refused to pay because the dress didn’t fit. Plaintiff
said, *• I made the dress properly ; only the lady has no
figure whatever. She would not be squeezed, and how
could I make her a Venus when she is all wadding?"
This created much laughter, in which his Honor joined.
Defendant, angrily, “I’m a better figure than jon are.
My husband is in Court; ask him I" The judicial
gravity couldn't stand this, and the Court, which was
probably mauled, nearly rolled off his chair. His
Honor : “ You must put the dress on, for me to see."
The lady accordingly retired, but on being rehabili.
tated, she seemed to be so loth to show off hot “ wad.
ding" figure, that she absolutely declined to come back
into Court. The judge, therefore, went in to the retir-
ing room, and after he had carefully—well, we presume,
looked at the lady, he decided that the dress was a
misfit, and nonsuited the plaintiff.
A novel and cruel combat was recently fought in
N. Carolina. Two young farmers, being rivals for a
young woman, agreed to fight it out with horsewhiym.
Tho whips were specially selected, strong and heavy,
and each second had a spare one in case of breakage.
The men stood on marked lines, one yard apart, in
sbirt sleeves, and at the word “ strike I" they struck
like fiends, and neither flinched. Hands, arms, and
faces were welted and waled, and blood oozed through
their shirts. At half an hour, “ titae ’’ was called, and
they took a spell, then faced one another again. For
over two hours, with short intervals, they breathlessly
la-hcd, sometimes with one hand, sometimes two; and
then the seconds stopped the flghr. 'i he courage dis-
played by both men was heroic, for they were gashed
and scored from head to foot 1 hey suffered terribly
for wetks, being scarcely able to lie down.
That contemptible being, the late Lord Lona-
r ale, hao one of the most beautiful women in England
for a wife. (Jlady., Countess of Lonsdale, as she is
now called, is tall, dark, and stalely, and ever since her
ddbnt in lb77, she has been fc nown as “the gipsy." A
pannile s beauty she was when the first came out, and
at 18, in the pr de of he» maidenhood, she was so.d
(excuse the Saxon bluntnes.) to the young Earl of Lons-
dale, who, though scarce four years uluer than herself,
was ooked upon as one of the most infamous reprobates
the English peersge h*d produced. A gieat, lubberly,
heavy-featured fellow he was—an animal, infaor, whoso
sensual tastes first exhibited themselves in a secret, but
unblndlnv, marriage with his tutor's housemaid before
he was seventeen; bis pronenesn to the inordinate nee
of alcohol also showing itself in numerous fits of
delirium tremens ere he had got out of his teens. Bat
he was the possessor of a hundred and sixty thousand
a year, and estates fo vast that even his reckless extra-
vagance oould scarcely diminish them. Besides, once
she was married-as, possibly, she had foreseen and
planned—the gipsy beauty did pretty we'l as she liked,
her flirtations wide still a bride with several titled
young guardsmen causing great scandals in her gilded
set. Now, the pretty widow has a house near Windsor,
and plenty of money, and entertains tho Prince of
Wales and other patricians. It cannot be said she has
“kept her character unspotted from the world," but
with rank, riches, and g-iod looks, she manages to tide
over most difficulties pretty smoothly.
An extraordinary case occurred at a French
Police Court. A Baroness was charged with being
drunk in ttae street. She oould not deny it, but she
proved that, a friend having advised her that no better
plan could be adopted to protect lure from moths thafi
to keep them in au empty spirit cask, she had stored
her winter cloak in that way. When she put it on,
the fumes of the alcohol acting with the cold made her
quite drunk, and a policeman stopped her as she stag-
gered along the street, • The magistrate discharged tho
ashamed Baroness.
A LOVE SONG.
Ah ! swan of slenderness,idove of tenderness,
Jewel of joys, arise t
The little red lark, like a rosy spark
Of song, to his sunburst flies;
But till you ate risen, earth is a prison,
Pall of my captive sighs
Then wake and discover to your fond lover
The morn of your matchless eyes.
The dawn Is dark to me: hark, oh 1 hark to me,
Pulse of my heart, I pray.
And gently gliding out ot thy hiding.
Dazzle me with thy day 1
And oh I I’ll fly to thee, singing, and sigh to thee,
Passion so sweet and gay.
The lark shall listen, and dewdrops glisten.
Laughing on everv spray.
