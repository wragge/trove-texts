THE RED PAGE.
A Recovered Hour—with W.B.D.
IT was on the threshold of September. The
seashone beneath an atmosphere all luminous
and still. The long waves gathered, rolled
and broke, purposeless. Light answered to
light along the brow of the woodlands, and the
undergrowth was dreaming into life of innumer-
able flowers. There was a strange air of unreality
about everything ; such a sensation as Mary
Johnston’s wanderers knew in the Autumn wood-
lands of primeval Virginia. Evidences of
humanity immediately about seemed to have no
concern with the day. Fallen eyelids were hardly
necessary to exclude them. When the fantasti-
cally crowned hill above the Manly beaches
appeared, memory grasped, realised, recovered a
bygone hour, without an effort.
Yes, it was even so 15 years ago. The day had
returned, and with all that had lived in it. Every
aspect of the present was lost, only the past was
real.
I passed the chalet front, and heard his voice
once more—
Eow me out from Desenzano, to your Sirmione, row.
So they rowed, and thus we landed, O Venusta Sirmio;
There to' us through all the groves of olives in the Summer
glow ;
There beneath the Roman ruins where the purple
flowers grow,
Game the “ Ave atque Vale ” of the poet’s hopeless woe—
Tenderest of Roman poets nineteen hundred years ago.
‘ ‘ Doesn’t he catch the very spirit of it, gather
it up, and set his sweet Catullus in the centre of
it. The sea, the sky, the day, like a God in a
shrine. And it is all here, all ours.”
“ Save Catullus.”
“Catullus is universal, or ought to be. He
should be here. He is part of it all. He would
be just as well placed as in that dear old Pagan
limbo of Dante’s, the only patch which appeals to
a human soul in the whole tremendous concern.
Do you see the olive-silvery foliage there on the
beach, and the grey on the hill sides older than
any ruins of Rome ? They are the world’s bones,
and some of them were old before Father
Abraham built his altar. The whole world’s face
is an altar to-day.
“ Let me give you a glass of wine. It is not a
day for claret. Golden Chasselas will suit it
better. A bit of the soul of such a day as this
must get into the berries whence such wine is
drawn. There is a light of opal in it, there is an
aroma of divinity. Chianti is dull by comparison.
There is as much soul in wine as in woman. Do
you remember Browning in those queer stanzas
where he sums up the drinks of the peoples?
What splendid, whole-souled old fellows they are
—those two poets of the time! Tennyson will
build up a game-pie with any cook, and Browning
on wine or drink runs over the whole gamut of
humanity’s tastes. You ought to know that. I’ll
get the book.”
The pulse of the sea beat on, restful as the drone
of bees in a garden. White pigeons wheeled in
the blue and came down to the grass with a
flutter.
He returned with the book, reading :
My heart sank with our claret-flask
Just now beneath the heavy sedges.
Our laughing little flask, compelled
Through depth to depth, more bleak and shady,
As when, both arms beside her held,
Feet straightened-out, some gay French lady
Is caught up from life’s light and motion t
And dropped into death’s silent ocean.
“ Ah, God ! that dear French lady ! Can’t you
feel her delicate daintiness ? And how he brings
the Tokay in :
Up jumped Tokay on the table,
Like a pigmy castle-warder ;
.And fierce he looked north, and fierce he looked south—
Blew with his bugle a challenge to drouth.
“He is the Devil of a fellow, real Hungarian
Tokay. M. and I once got out a few cases of him.
We wanted enlarged experience. He sets you
dreaming of wildfire and witches. No wonder the
old fellow, Janos, went to look for his spring after
a bout with him. And then we come to classic
British. And the instance :
Here’s to Nelson’s memory
’Tis the second time that I at sea
Have drunk it deep in British beer
Right off Cape Trafalgar here.
“Nelson, with the tar-patch on his shoulder,
got when he used to stand :
—zig-zag zigging
Up against the mizen-rigging.
“ Good old Blake or Rodney just the same ; the
twang of the beer-barrel in them strong as the
salt of the sea. Big men of action take all the
good of life. Australia is mean, so far, through
lack of a healthy optimism. She will not drank
of the cup of her own bounty. She has the golden
fleece, but where is her own cloth-of-gold ? It
ought to be two inches deep over acres of drawing
and dining-rooms yonder. It should hang out in
the streets like the draperies of old Venice on a
festal day. We see no more of it than the money-
spinner sees of the Shekinah which is all about to-
day. Let us try a little walk. ‘We may entertain
angels unawares, only moving through the atmos-
phere. 5
The Divine presence of that day ! It was such
as old Lucretius knew
When light is large and lambs are glad, nosing the
mother’s udder,
And the bird makes his heart voice amid the blaze of
flowers
Which things appear the work of mighty Gods.
The glory of it was on his broad face looking
well up, and the sea talked for us as we strolled
&\ye met a workman moving painfully on a
crutch. He of the liberal and comprehensive
beatitudes stopped.
“ Old boy, what’s up, eh ? ”
“Broke me leg, sir, in the quarry.”
“That’sbad, old boy. That’s bad. And how
do you get along ? Hard times, eh ?”
“ Might be worse. There’s the lodge, you see,
sir, and my mates stick to me a bit.”
“Suppose I come in with the mates then?
With love, old boy, with love.”
* * * *
A roar from the ; throat of a huge, incoming
steamship shattered the mirror of that memory.
The whole canopy of things trembled, and those
soul-chambers, wherein realisations are made,
were suddenly, strangely, sadly vacant. They,
alas ! are not to be re-peopled at will. The day
was no more germinal. I only saw
—a dream within a dream,
The hilltop hearsed with pines.
The sea was as the eye of a dead God, and there
was stir in the windy halls of Heaven, as though
some mean servitors of the Infinities were hustling
away the glory of afternoon to make room for the
chills and shadows of the lower and lesser night.
FRANK MYESS.
Some Tendencies of the 20th
Century Novel.
AND now the merry laughter of children is heard
in the great hall of Haddon Abbey, which for
long had been strange to that home-like sound ;
and as Lord Artarmon, with his wife—grown
more lovely, if posssible, with the years—bent
over the cradle of their youngest, a tender light came into
lis brown eyes as he murmured -
That is an extract, in as near an approximation
;o the exact words as memory permits, from the
Last chapters of a thousand or so novels of the
early 19th century. Almost any novel from the
masterpieces downwards, between, say, 1790 and
1870, which ends with “they married and lived
happily ever afterwards,” peers into the future
with a curious eye, and suggests, with more or
less directness, that children came to bless the
union of the lovers. When the village wedding-
bells are set a-ringing in the novel of that period,
for Howard, with the beauteous brown moustache,
and Dorothy, with the golden hair and deep blue
eyes, the author (unless a lady, and few ladies
wrote then) can seldom forbear, in the exuberance
of his desire to see his puppets really and truly
happy, making a reference to the future midwife.
In the novel of the 20th century the cradle is
usually banished. That is one notable tendency
in the modern novel—its calm disregard of
the fact that there are children in the
world. But stay—children are allowed to peep
into life now and again in the modern novel, pro-
vided that they are either (1) illegitimate or (2)
the progeny of divorced parents. One notable
novel (“ What Maisie Knew ”) is entirely devoted
to a child—and her experience of the marital un-
happiness of her parents. Sarah Grand, too,
will occasionally bring a baby into her fiction, if
it is a horribly diseased example of the sins of a
father. Speaking generally, however, the cradle
has vanished from present-day fiction. Young
people still love ardently in modern novels; they
still marry or dispense with marriage. But they
no longer have any children. It is clearly bad
form to have children.
The 20th century novel, for a time at least, will
probably deal very largely with politics. Most of
the more successful of recent works of fiction have
a political basis. A flavoring of politics in a novel
is no new thing ; the strengthening of a love story
with some scenes on the hustings, or a Parlia-
mentary debate, is as old-fashioned as Ly tton. But
the modern political novel is often all politics, with
but a flavoring of other matters, and enters into
the minutiae of machine-intrigues, party moves,
and lobby manoeuvres. It is a new and a wide
field and can be worked profitably for many
years to come without exhausting the wealth of
strong ideas. Historical novels, unless of very
exceptional power, don’t gain much vogue now :
the “conscience” novel which maundered drearily
through 500 pages to describe the change of John
Jones from Calvinism to esoteric Buddhism
seems to be absolutely dead. The crude ‘ ‘ simul-
taneous-mission ” sermon in tomes of Hall Caine
and Corelli also appears to have had its day.
The industrial problems of the moment will pro-
vide another grand field for the 20th century novel-
ist. Zola touched the fringe of the subject in such
books as “Money” and “The Women’s Para-
dise ” (a splendid yam about selling drapery which
those peopleshould read who imagine Z. is all porno-
graphy). Kipling was now and again on the verge of
making an experiment in this line (witness his
railway-engine yams), but he never had the sus-
tained capacity for a good novel. The Americans are
however entering boldly into the field, and already
novels of wonderfully strong interest have been
published on such apparently unpromising sub-
jects as railway management and grain transporta-
tion. It is safe to predict that some really great
novels will be written on industrial topics this
century.
Woman as woman—as the desirable female—is
losing her place as the supreme motive of a novel.
Since the “ new women” books began their series
of indecent exposures, the “love novel” is
generally nauseating, and there is more and more
of a tendency among the better class novelists to
treat sex as a matter of second or third-rate interest.
The vitally important object of the hero’s life
now is not the acquisition of the heroine as a wife,
but the conquest of a business or of a cause. There
is much less sentiment and much more of the prac-
tical spirit in the 20th century novel. On the
other hand, woman as a citizen, as a fellow-human,
as a personality with the possibilities of an inde-
pendent career, is claiming each year a larger
share of the novelist’s attention. A few years ago
no woman was introduced into a novel except for
the purpose of being married, or of being punished
for some wrong-doing by a sentence of spinster-
hood. The women in novels existed only in rela-
tion to matrimony. Now they often act a part
quite independent of any shell considerations.
If a people’s novels reflect the tendency of a
people’s thoughts, as it is generally supposed is
the case, then the 20th century, it would seem, is
moving towards —
(1) A weakening of the family tie, a greater
tolerance of what is conventionally known as im-
morality, an increasing dislike of the responsi-
bilities of parentage.
(2) A cessation from morbid introspection on
“matters of conscience” ; a desire to relegate the
discussion of sex-matters to the old women of both
sexes, lay and clerical.
(3) A more general and a more practical interest
in economics and politics.
Some of these symptoms are encouraging, others
very much otherwise. None may prove to be
permanent, but all (judging from current novels)
seem to affect this generation at least.
F.R.
Reminiscences of General Gallifet, just pub-
lished, contain a characteristically Gallic story of
a young officer who fished for and landed, from
his bedroom window, a carp that was the pride of
the country-house where he was staying. The
fish was centuries old (by repute), and an enormous
size. When he got it through the window it made
trouble, finally bringing up the host, who slept
below, to see what the noise was about. The
lieutenant dared not confess his poaching, so he
hid the carp in his bed, where it continued to
struggle. Enter the host to inquire whether his
guest is ill. The guest meets him at the door,
and protests that all is well. The stately old
gentleman looks beyond him, observes an un-
wonted agitation in the bed, instantly sums up
the (imagined) situation, apologises, and with-
draws.
“ Anon ” writes :
It seems that Alexander Sutherland has had to wait
like too many other men for recognition after death. A
“ Red Page ” correspondent, a few weeks back dismissed
his Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct as “ a con-
tribution to Scottish philosophy,” without inquiring into
its precise value. The use of the word “ Scottish ” was
incorrect. Sutherland’s work is a contribution to philo-
sophy in general, and can be termed Scottish only because
he was born in Scotland. Sutherland’s attempt at an
ethical philosophy is no unimportant one. The two
volumes, which represent 11 years of hard work, are full of
go d solid thought and uncommon intellectual insight.
Sutherland’s conception is of ethics based on evolution,
by appealing to natural selection, or, as he calls it, to the
working of “elimination” in one region after another.
It is with this conception that he would unlock the mys-
teries of progress. Sutherland over-modestly claims to
have merely expanded Darwin's chapter in the “ Descent
of Man.” But Darwin did not trace out in detail, as
Sutherland has done, the derivation of human morality
from animal sociality ; which is the briefest description of
his aim. Sutherland has, with a magnificent fixity of
purpose, kept to the appeal to natural selection, and to
natural selection alone. It is interesting to note that
Melbourne can claim another scholar in the same field of
thought. Samuel Alexander has also considered ethics
in the light of Darwinism, but from the standpoint of
what is called “ internationalism.” Alexander, who is
now a professor of ethics in London, was a schoolboy at
Wesley College and a Melbourne 'Varsity student; his
scholastic and academic career being unparalleled for
brilliancy to this day.
Jt
Mrs. Lance Rawson writes on “ Literary
Women ”:
Literary men and women do attract each other, but
only temporarily. And, with all deference to the con-
ventionalities and proprieties of our social system, there
is no more ideal or more satisfying union than that of
two literary clmms, provided it begins and ends with the
one moon. As'to the woman-writer making copy out of
her disreputable husband, the idea is unique, and cer-
tainly not true. lam convinced that no woman-writer
has ever, or could ever do such a thing, not from
any feelings of sentiment, but simply because her own
immediate circumstances never appeal to her. She
sees copy in her neighbours' affairs, but never
—or very rarely—in her own ;as a rule they are too
wretchedly and violently real to give her the stimulus of
interest actually necessary to make writing possible.
She wants to write of things and interests outside herself,
just as she wants to read the books she has never read
before in preference to those she knows by heart. Con-
stance Clyde is right when she says that a literary
woman’s invented love-affair is more real and more
brilliant than fact. The reason is, in many cases,
that reserved and shy with men (whom she instinctively
knows do not understand her), she finds relief and satis-
faction in portraying love and passion as she would have
it. That every woman is the heroine of her own love
stories is another fact, and there are woman writers who
find more satisfaction and real sensation in a scene with a
lover of their own creating than with any man of flesh
and blood passions.
THE TWO ISEULTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If wand’ring some gray eve
In the oak-grove, whose sere leaves strow the ground',.
My dream of years should leave,
And, waking me from reverie profound,
Bid me rejoice, or grieve,—
I wonder which were keener, joy or grief ?
Belief or disbelief ? s
For many years I’ve loved the woman-graces
Of old times and old places ;
I’ve walked where they have walked ; have heard
Their sorrow and their joy ; have seen their
Have known without disguise
The deepest feelings that within them stirred ;
I’ve laughed with them, and with them I have wept;
Loved them, in dream awake, in truth when I have slept
Iseult of Cornwall : she
Whom Tristram loved, and woman none beside ;
Iseult of Brittany:
Loving, unloved, beautiful, mournful-eyed—
Which was more sad ? Ay, me !
One loved, was loved again ; but Love’s best bliss—
She could but dream of this.
One loved, was loved not, yet beside her trod
Her vain love’s only god.
0 women, both denied that dearest love,
Where was the virtue of your constancy?
Ah ! ’twas not constancy
To man, to flesh, but to a spirit above.
But, when two souls as one might never be,
Would either wish extinction ?—or eternity ?

MEN! WOMEN!
We can make you
Strong and Vigorous.
We have the means at hand to cure you; we know what you require before you can regain your vigour; you need New Life, New Nerve
Force, New Ambition. Follow our advice—Use ELECTRICITY, and it will cure you.
We know that the life of each organ, each nerve, depends upon a hidden vital force, and we know that ELECTRICITY is that force. If
each nerve cell in your body is full of NERVE FORCE—ELECTRICITY—you can have no weakness.
To the man or woman with LAME BACK, RHEUMATISM, SCIATICA, LUMBAGO, NERVE EXHAUSTION, or any CHRONIC
AILMENT, we can offer you a Sure and Certain Cure. Long ago you passed the stage where DRUGS were of any value, and now your only chance of
regaining strength lies in using
Or. fl)c[aughlin’s Electric Belt.
The grandest invention of the age for weak men ; the surest and easiest cure for all nervous and.chronic
diseases. Its wonderful power is directed to the seat of the nervous system, through which its vitalising
strength penetrates to all parts of the body, carrying new life to every organ which has been weakened
by dissipation, restoring energy to the brain, and power to the vital organs. No weak man, no sickly
or delicate woman, will ever regret a fair trial of the Dr. McLaughlin Electric Belt, which is
Nratue’s restorer of vitality. It developes the organs, expands the tissues, corrects the circulation, and renews the entire nervous system.
80 Underwood-st., PADDINGTON.
Sirs,—After thirty years' suffering from in-
jury to my back and kidneys, the result of a
fall from my horse, your Electric Belt has
dope for me what the best medical skill had
failed to do.
I can now recommend the Belt to every
sufferer. lam 60 years of age.—Yours very
truly, ELIZABETH ROSE.
DGOEN, Vic.
For years I have suffered from Sciatica and
Weak Back, but a few weeks of your Electric
Belt cured me, and put me right again. It
give 3 me great pleasure to recommend your
Belt to both friends and strangers.
Yours truly, D. MURRAY.
KALGOORLIE, W.A.
Dr. McLaughlin Co. ,
Replying to your inquiry after my health,
I am just debating leaving the Belt off.
Tliere has been a wonderful improvement in
my condition ; in fact, I hardly know I was
ever queer. If I can help your cause, you
have my support.
JAMES HUGHES.
Call and let us show you exactly how our Belt accomplishes these remarbable cures, learn how susceptible it is to human control. A Belt
or Invigorator that can’t be controlled is worse than useless. Ours is the only one having a Regular Attachment. ADVICE and Written
Diagnosis by post ABSOLUTELY FREE. Come and convince yourself. CONSULTATION FREE.
Book
For the benefit of all persons interested in this Grand Remedy, we publish a Beautifully Illustrated Book, giving cuts,
and showing how we apply Electricity in all CHRONIC AILMENTS. It gives also many names of people cured. Write
for it. You may find the names of some of your friends in it. In printing our book we have been able to steer clear of all
technical terms, leaving the subject plain and comprehensible to any person—even'a child. HOURS—9 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.

The Lightning Train.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a train that travels at lightning speed
through the valleys of Day and Night,
And strong men shudder and pale in the rays of
its head-lamp’s livid light ;
For no man knows but the rails are laid for the
train to stop at his door
And add to its burden of countless souls a spirit
or two the more.
We hear no jarring of piston-rods, nor hissing of
prisoned steam,
There’s never a sound from the flying wheels nor
the faintest furnace-gleam.
The driver speaks, as he halts a space, in a tone of
hoarse command,
And a “ single’s ” booked for a journey then, Ex-
press to the Unknown Land.
All travel “ First,” on a level at last, and Lazarus
elbows Dives;
The women who “ haunt the streets ” may rest by
the side of “honored wives.”
No question of race, or class, or caste is raised on
this oompany’s road.
Agnostic and atheist —Buddlia and Christ —
Mohammed to ballast the load.
The terminus? Where? That question’s vexed
the souls of the countless years,
And some have lied with an answer vague to stifle
their own weak fears ;
And they battered away at the face of the World,
and wore out heart and brain,
And, dazed with the mystery, stepped one day on
board of the Lightning Train.

My Fores Love.
My Love I found in the bushland,
Of the bush she minds me still,
The beauty of flowers of the lowland,
And the freshness of the hill.
Her hair holds beams of the wattle,
With fire-pea touches enrolled ;
In the shade it is soft and dusky,
In the sunshine tawny gold.
Her hands are tanned by the sun-ray,
The tint of a young fern’s stem ;
She is dainty as sun-dew blossoms
From her curls to her white frock’s hem.
Sun-kissed is the face of my Love,
’Cross which quaint fancies roam ;
Her cheeks are smooth as the hacks of bees
As they cluster round the comb.
Her eyes—there’s a dear little floweret,
Whatever may be its name,
It is blue as the eyes of Hope must be,
And her eyes are j ust the same.
LELA.
Grey Eyes.
God’s finest night is on the world,
His smile from Heav’n swims, golden, down,
I see the young mists, caught and curled,
Rise, swooning, o’er th® sleeping town,
Like wraiths astray from olden Death,
They sweep and sway, and softly rise;
Thro’ these and all
The shadow thrall,
x see you peer, dear reckless eyes !
I may not live without you, yet
I see you now in dreams alone.
Would that these arms, my fine coquette,
Could round that neck of thine be thrown !
Come other lips and other wiles;
Come life, or doom from out the skies,
Still bent and blind,
Oh, I would find,
Where’er thou wert, dear, sweet grey eyes !
The black trees stand asleep, asleep,
All hung with velvet silences,
And purple shadows cool and deep.
The wind is with the summer seas.
Oh ye who haunt iny dreams alway,
And drown my heart with tender sighs ;
I heard your breath
As soft as death ;
I felt you near, dear laughing eyes !
I love thee more and evermore,
That Fate hath flung our lives apart,
Pray, dear, that in the great Before,
We stand in joy of heart and heart,
In those Elysian halls and heights,
Beside the good old g®ds and wise ;
That, hand and hand,
We walk the land
Of sweet desire, dear reckless eyes !
VIC.
C. L. Rivers.
Lips and Stars.
Stars on the beach a-gleaming—
Tears in her dark, sweet eyes ;
Clouds in the sky-fields dreaming ;
Lips that are soft with sighs.
Hearts that are nigh to breaking ;
Breasts all a-cry for love.
Souls all a-parch for slaking—
Winds and the rain above.
Two in the tide-way going,
Waves that pursue their feet;
Surf an$ a star-breath blowing,
Swords of the sea’s sharp sleet.
“Kiss,” say thp winds, “and kissing,
Pass through the dark-way’d night ”
“ Kiss,” say the waves far-hissing ;
“ Kiss ! ” cries the spindrift white.
Two in the tideway going
Under the dreaming moon.
Love in her dark eyes glowing,
Love on the beach star-strewn !

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1902.
The Cornstalk Balance-Sheet.
The budget, fake, financial statement, or
political swindle of New South Wales was
presented in due course last week. It wasn’t
a wildlv-outrageous swindle, as such things
go in Australia, but it was bad enough. On
an absolute cash basis the State received
last financial year £11,359,992, and paid
away £11,444,586, so that there was a deficit
of £84,594. But the receipts include some
amounts recovered last year from pay-
ments made the year before last; and
the expenditure includes some amounts
paid last year which may be recovered,
in part, this year; and by carefully
eliminating these-items Treasurer Waddell
produces an alleged surplus of £2982.
(He also, by another whirl of the figures,
seems to show a deficit of £8820.) There
is no surplus if the accounts are dealt with
on a cash basis, but the famous cash basis
only applies where it will do the Treasury
service by making the figures look better —
it is so called because it is a base scheme for
pretending to have cash that doesn’t exist.
It applies in this sense, that the interest on
the public debt for the half-year ended 30th
June, 1902, is not charged to the financial
year ended 30th June, 1902, because it isn’t
actually paid to the public creditor till Ist
July, which is the first day of the new
financial year. In that instance the cash
basis principle is as solid as a rock on the
matter of not charging anything, even though
it may be due, unless it is actually paid.
But the principle doesn’t make the Treasurer
charge himself with money actually paid if
there is the worst possible excuse for not
doing so.
As already mentioned, the N.S.W. deficit
for the year ended 30th June, 1902, amounted,
on a strictly cash system, to £84,594. The
fact that it was really about £360,000 was
artistically disguised by using as revenue
over £270,000 obtained, in one way or other,
from unpaid-for properties in the resumed
area of Sydney. When these properties
came into the hands of the State, it imme-
diately began to receive the rents, and it
also immediately became liable to pay to the
previous owners interest on the purchase-
money due to them, but, by using the rents
as income and paying the interest, or the
bulk of the interest, up to the date of settle-
ment, out of loans, the revenue got, on paper
at all events, about £270,000 ahead of
the expenditure. In a country where public
solvency is nothing, and “ saving the face ”
of the tenth-rate gang in office is everything,
such proceedings are common enough. The
resumption of the worst plague-stricken area
in Sydney, with a view to its conversion into
a clean and reputable locality, was a great
Socialistic experiment ; and if it wasn’t that
in Australia, and especially in N.S.W., every
such idea is looked upon, first and foremost,
as a means to a possible swindle, the experi-
ment would have more than justified itself.
But the See Government’s dodges and
political wiles have loaded the resumed area
with a great moral stench and something
like £12,000 or £16,000 a year of needless
interest—the interest on the swindle above
mentioned. Thus what should have been a
paying investment has been, in all proba-
bility, turned into a dead loss ; and when
the accounts come to light, State Socialism
will probably receive a set-back that will be
felt for many years. The fact that the
Labor party, which is distinctly the party of
State Socialism, supported the Government
which thus dragged its principles in the
gutter, and that it was its support and its
vote which enabled the See Government to
drag its principles in the gutter, is a most
lamentable side - issue of the dismal pro-
ceeding.
• * ♦ *
Furthermore, the deficit of about £360,000
above mentioned was only prevented from
being about £1,300,000 by the most lavish
and unscrupulous use of loan money for
repairs, replacements, and for necessary but
wholly unproductive works, and for altera-
tions and temporary jobs, to describe which
in the loan schedules as “permanent and
reproductive ” is an impudent and outrage-
ous falsehood. And the See Government
further “saved its face” by suspending
payment of a sum of £lOO,OOO due in
reduction of the old deficit—that most
ancient spectre which has dwelt in the
land now for 16 years, and which
seems still as robust as at any previous
period of its history. Concerning the worst
of these public frauds there is a general con-
spiracy of silence. No party in N.S.W.,
nor in any other State, is prepared to
denounce the wholesale use of loan money
for unproductive works, patches, and odd
jobs ; for the party which committed itself
to a sane and solvent policy would also
commit itself, when it got into power, to the
heavy labor and dead weight of finding the
money for that policy of solvency.
* * * *
New South Wales now Faces the Dawn
of a new financial year with a debt of close
on £79,000,000, including all loans up to
date —an increase of over £7,000,000 during
the past twelve months. Three years
more at this rate of progress will bring
the debt to £100,000,000, and then, pre-
sumably, N.S.W. will celebrate another
Centenary, and issue a new Centennial
stamp bearing the device, “We owe
£100,000,000. ’ ’ Treasurer W addell assures
the State that it need not carry any burden
on its mind by reason of this stupendous
accumulation of debt because it has
£86,000.000 worth of assets created by the
borrowed money aforesaid, and that ima-
ginary syndicate, which we always hear of
but never meet, would gladly buy them for a
sum which would more than pay off - the
whole Cornstalk liability. Seeing that the
assets in question yield only £1,993,000 a
year net —nearly £BOO,OOO less than the in-
terest on the public debt —no syndicate which
wanted 5 per cent, on its money would, be
likely to give quite £40,000,000 for the lot
—equal to about 10s. in the £ on the debt
with which they are encumbered; but it is one
of the crazy legends of the See Government
that N.S.W.’s roads, bridges, fortifications,
rivers, dredged channels, gaols, court-houses,
schools, lunatic asylums, benevolent asy-
lums, museums, immigration policy, and
deficit are all saleable assets, and that
Pieupont Moegan, or some such person,
won’t be happy till he gets them at any
price.
♦ * * *
For the present financial year the See
Government anticipates a surplus of rather
over £BB,OOO. The anticipation of a surplus
is a matter of course—a fixed and ineradic-
able habit from which few Governments
escape. But this surplus is based, as usual,
on the assumption that about £1,000,000 of
what should be ordinary expenditure will be
charged to loans, bringing the inevitable
smash and day of reckoning so much the
nearer. And the “ prosperity ”on which
Treasurer Waddell relies to produce his
glorious anticipated revenue of £11,236,132
depends entirely on the expenditure of
£5,000,000 or so of loan money during the
year to keep the boom alive. When the
inevitable breakage takes place, and loans
can’t be raised, there will be such a downfall
that the revenue is much more likely to be
£8,000,000 than £11,000,000. A country
which borrows in one year a sum equal to all
the cash in its banks is balancing itself in a
crazy fashion on the thin edge of a hair, and
may go over at any moment. At present
the stupendous borrowing keeps up the
boom, the boom keeps up the revenue, and
the revenue doesn’t keep up with the ex-
penditure by fully a million, that being the
amount of ordinary outgoings that are now
regularly charged to loans. Of course if
N.S.W. paid, as it should do, for repairs and
unproductive works out of revenue, it would
have to reduce its borrowings; even the
maddest man with an O’ before his name could
hardly find £5,000,000 worth of permanent
and reproductive works to do every year for
a community of less than li million people.
And, if borrowing was reduced, the drunken
boom would fade, and then the revenue
would fall away, and a better statesman than
John See would be required to face the
situation.
* * * »
There are many troubles ahead. The
Civil Service Superannuation Fund will be
exhausted in about another year—made
bankrupt through the stealing of its funds
by bygone Ministries. Then the civil ser-
vice pensions will become a charge on the
revenue, and add nearly another £lOO,OOO a
year to the outgoings. The railway revenue
is declining. The land revenue is falling
away, through liberal remissions of rent and
other causes. All the loans are exhausted ;
over £4,000,000 of trust funds and Savings
Bank deposits have been borrowed to keep
the public works policy going ; and the next
big loan is very badly wanted indeed. The
interest bill has climbed up to over
£2,800,000 a year. The interest which is
not provided for by the revenue from public
works, but which comes wholly out of taxa-
tion, is now much more per inhabitant than
the entire interest bill of the United King-
dom. | The whole dizzy house of cards depends
on the goodwill and continued confidence of
English financiers—and they can’t always
keep on having confidence in a State which
wants to borrow £5,000,000 a year to keep
itself out of the poorhouse. When once
loans stop in London, the collapse of the
whole scheme of brag, boom, begging, bor-
rowing and arrogant mendicancy will come
with a rush.
Philp, the Secessionist.
Up in Queensland, that little tenth-rate man,
Premier Philp, threatens that the next elec-
tion will be fought on the question of Seces-
sion. According to Philp, Queensland is burning
with wrath at the ill-results of Federation, and
desires to be rid of the Federal bond at any cost.
The way to set about getting rid of it, according
to Philp, is by a Referendum, which shows how
little indeed he knows concerning the agreement
into which his State entered, for the Federal union
is indissoluble, and the Constitution provides no
way out whatever. Of course, there is always a
way out, not mentioned in the Constitution —by
successful insurrection, but Philp isn’t a successful
man by nature, and he isn’t the sort of material
of which even a Jefferson Davis is constructed.
Moreover, before an insurrection can be success-
ful, there must be somebody to insurrect. If
Queensland was behind Philp in his desire to
secede from the Commonwealth, something might
happen, always provided Philp was the right
man to go in front. With the wrong man in
front, and nothing in particular behind, the
prospect is hopeless as well as ridiculous.
* * * *
The situation in Queensland is peculiar. The
freat grievance of the Philp party is that the
'ederal Parliament has set its face steadily
against cheap-nigger labor—against the importa-
tion of black men, and yellow men, and cannibals
recently retired from the human-flesh industry,
and heathens, and opium-eaters, against the mon-
grel races which fill the back slums of Cairns and
the unclean bye-ways of Cooktown, against
Joss and Confucius, against the destruction of
the Anglo-Saxon type and the adulteration of the
Anglo-Saxon race. It did this at the emphatic
bidding of the Queensland representatives, elected
by the Queensland people on the widest and most
liberal suffrage on earth. It is still doing it at
the bidding of these representatives, and the said
representatives have heard nothing from their
constituents to lead them to believe that the latter
have changed their views on the subject. Queens-
land’s delegates in the Federal Parliament are
elected on a suffrage which gives to every citizen an
equal share of political power. Its representatives
in the State Parliament are elected in various ways
which give Property a hugelypreponderating influ-
ence. The brick-and-mortar element in Queens-
land’s State Legislature is for the retention of cheap
nigger labor at all costs. The human element,
represented by Queensland’s delegation to the
Federal Parliament, is on the other side. Philp
appears on behalf of the bricks and the mortar,
and voices the fixed opinions of the jerry-built
tenement, and the mortgage, and the unsavoury
back-yard ; and, being a dull, tenth-rate man, he
fails to realise that Queensland consists of men,
not bricks, and that his State Parliament doesn’t
represent Queensland in any sense that can serve
for purposes of secession. In any real attempt at
secession one brawny miner or one hardy stock-
rider counts for more than six corner allotments
and 40,000 shares in a reconstructed bank ; and 10
bushmen who have no vote in the State Parlia-
ment are worth a lot more than one fat bell-
toppered man in an office, who has 10 votes.
* * * *
Philp and his following demand separation
mainly because the Federal system promises to
destroy the trade in cheap, servile, colored labor,
and give the white Queenslander a better chance
of employment. Also, because the abolition of
border customs duties has reduced the revenue, as
everybody knew it must do, and has made it
necessary for the arrogant Queensland Fat Man
to pay a land-tax, or an income-tax, or both, to
fill the financial gap, just as the similar individual
does in almost every other civilised country on
this earth. Behind Philp are the Tory papers of
Brisbane, a section of the nominee Legislative
Council, the nigger bosses of a few coastal dis-
tricts, the much-reconstructed Q.N. Bank, certain
dilapidated building societies and land companies,
the Chinese in their dens at Cairns and Cooktown,
a few shipowners in the Polynesian trade, the Jap
and Malay population of Thursday Island and its
vicinity, the pearl-fishing interest, the deficit, the
public debt, the leper station, and all the mongrel
elements of the community—also the large
stomach, the belltopper, the frock coat, the mort-
gage, and the overdraft. And behind the Federal
Parliament in its anti-nigger policy is white
Queensland in general—the Force that will Carry
the Gun if any real attempt at secession is ever
made. Which end of that gun will be pointed at
Philp is a matter that requires no explanation.

Secession means War—nothing more nor less.
In war the man who has no suffrage can shoot just
as straight as the man who has six, and all the fak-
ing of the State electoral rolls that was ever
invented goes for nothing. It is no use to dis-
franchise the enemy—he is there just the same.
In the Queensland State Parliament it may be
easy to get a vote, or a dozen votes, in favor of
separation, but the Philp majority in the State
Parliament only exists by a systematic faking of
the electoral rolls and similar devices. When
Queensland is polled on a one-inan-one-vote basis it
would sooner hang Philp on a gallows 40ft. high
than follow him in his secessionist policy. Queens-
land in the mass has no desire to break up the
Commonwealth in order to prevent a handful of
rich men paying a land-tax. White Queensland in
general isn’t prepared to fight in order that the
ex-cannibal from Polynesia may get what employ-
ment is going, while the white Queenslander
is penniless and a vagrant. It doesn’t care
to commit itself to a life and death struggle
for the retention of the opium-sodden Chow
of Cairns, knowing well that when it lost its
leg in battle the Philp Government would
simply put it in gaol for having insufficient visible
means of support. If Queensland in general is
disappointed with the results of Federation, it
will doubtless explain the fact at next Federa
election, and then it will be time enough to con-
sider the situation. Nothing it can signify at
any State election where the Property vote and
the “ Bulcocking ” policy control the issues,
has any bearing on the case, for the matter is not
one to be decided by the brick and mortar vote.
No hole-and-corner meeting at Brisbane, which
was always anti-Federal, counts for anything.
And Philp’s own statements count for nothing,
as showing the opinion of Queensland on the sub-
ject, Philp himself being an accident, and not
very much of that. He represents an elderly
minority which governs Queensland by disfran-
chising or overruling the vote of the majority.
And when he talks of Secession he is endeavoring
to provoke a trouble in which the impressive top
hat of his little oligarchy will be trodden under-
foot by the force of numbers, and where the person
with half-a-dozen unsecured overdrafts will be of
no more account than anybody else.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Philp’s Opportunity.
If Premier Philp, of Queensland, really desires to
get square with the Commonwealth, about which
there appears to be no doubt, there is a much
simpler and more efficient way than by the feeble
little Separation movement, which is foredoomed
to failure in any case. Let the Queensland Par-
liament simply intimate that it can’t pay its way
under the Federal tariff; that it respectfully
declines to take its monthly share of the customs
and excise surplus; and that it hereby deposits
its public debt (all except the small fraction held
in Queensland, on which it would be necessary to
still pay interest in order to prevent the collapse
of the Queensland banks) on the Federal doorstep;
and that the Federal Government may do what it
darned well pleases with debt and surplus. That
would be a picturesque vengeance. Queensland
would save £600,000 a year (it would lose about
£900,000 of revenue and save £1,500,000 of
interest), and with that amount to the good
it wouldn’t need to care if its credit was gone. It
could do without loans. It would wreak a fiendish
retaliation on the other States which voted for the
abolition of the Kanaka, for nobody would look at
an Australian loan again for years—not even a
renewal loan, and Alfred Deakin’s State has a
£5,000,000 loan to renew shortly. It would knock
the proposed Federal loan into a cocked hat. And
if the Federal Government took over the debt that
Queensland had dropped, it couldn’t levy extra
taxes on Queensland to make up the shortage in
the interest without levying exactly similar taxes
on the other States, which would be more ven-
geance. Besides the shock to the credit of the
other States would still remain. Of course the
European creditor would say things, but if Philp
explained that it was all owing to the stoppage of
Kanaka labor the chances are that the European
creditor would agree with him and sympathise.
Philp has a unique opportunity to be nasty—if his
capacity for being nasty is anything like his desire
that way.
The Transport Death-traps.
There is a very evident and very natural wish on
the part of the British War Office to secure a
white-washing verdict in regard to the transport
horrors which marked the close of the war. That
the War Office authorities acted with care-
less brutality is patent on the facts disclosed,
but at an official inquiry it is possible to slur over
awkward facts with all sorts of plausible excuses
culled from Army regulations. In regard to the
Maoriland transports, the Royal Commission of
inquiry has striven to throw the whole blame of
the fearful mortality on the officers and men,
though it is reluctantly admitted that they
were not responsible for the Britannic being
sent to sea with an outbreak of measles on board.
There is no statement as to who was respon-
sible. The report, in short, is what might have
been expected from that Jingo-ridden land.
The Drayton Grange report has not yet been given
to the public ; but there is a very big effort on the
part of the military authorities to secure a white-
washing verdict in that case also. This cable
from London was published in the Sydney dailies
of Sept. 24:
The transport Oswestry Grange has arrived in England
from South Africa.
A Court of Inquiry was held immediately upon the
arrival of the vessel, and measurements taken before the
troops were landed.
Newspaper reporters interviewed many of the returned
soldiers, who professed themselves perfectly satisfied with
their accommodation and treatment during the voyage.
They stated that they were well fed, and that there was
no sickness on board.
The troopship Oswestry Grange sailed from South
Africa on August 25. She is a sister ship of the Drayton
Grange, and carried 2000 British troops to Southampton.
She had increased hospital accommodation, but otherwise
the arrangements were similar to those on the Drayton
Grange, on which a number of deaths occurred on the
voyage to Australia.
Which seems to be a pretty good argument
that the Drayton Grange horrors were due to the
Australian men and not to the British authorities.
But its value is considerably discounted by the


fact that the Oswestry Grange experiment was a
carefully-prepared one. The S’African papers
give that fact away. A Scotch soldier writes to
S’African Owl, date Aug. 29:
The Oswestry Grange, a sister ship in every particular
to the Drayton Grange, sails this week from the South
Arm with 2000 Tommies. The Drayton Grange occupied
17 days, and the Oswestry Grange will be 21 days at sea,
and will cross the Tropics; while the Australian transport
travelled over calm seas in the mildest weather [i.e.,
in bitterly bleak, wet Antarctic weather.—Ed. B.]. It will
be interesting to see what happens to the company of the
Oswestry Grange. You will learn of no complaints, no
mutiny, no drunkenness, no petty, puling conduct. And
you will find few of the sturdy, hardy, trouble-facing
Tommies malingering or making babies of themselves.
But the fact that, with careful preliminary per-
cautions, picking of men and officers, &c., 2000
regular troops can be safely sent by the Oswestry
Grange, takes away nothing of the brutality of
sending the Drayton Grange away with 2000
troops, stowaways variously calculated up to 242,
and an infectious epidemic disease on board.
There is one “excuse,” and one only, that the
British War Office can advance in palliation of
these Australian transport horrors—that the same
criminal disregard of proper precautions, the same
callous carelessness as to the lives of the done-
with soldiers, was shown to S’African as to Aus-
tralian troops. Johannesburg Leader, of Aug.
20, reports:
A train, laden with 600 soldiers (S’African troopers) in
open trucks, arrived at East London on Thursday night,
between 11 and 12 o’clock. These men had hoarded the
train at Krugersdorp and places en route, and at heavy
parts of the line two engines were used for the train.
The men are said to have suffered terribly on the journey,
owing to severe weather at Molteno and Toise River,
where there was a heavy fall of sleet and rain. Eight
men died on the journey, from exposure or from some
other cause.
It will be, perhaps, in a measure, comforting to
know that all “colonials” are treated alike; if
opportunity does not permit to sacrifice them on
transports, open railway trucks in snowy weather
are utilised. Surely Australia won’t be so un-
gracious as to complain of what Maoriland has
tolerated, and Cape Colony suffered apparently
without protest ?
Selina San gal.
This paper holds no brief for the hangman, and
thinks that there is better use for even its worst
artist than to hang him by the neck till he is
dead. But, while hanging remains a national
institution, it would like to see the right people
hanged. The squalid and tragic amour of August
Tisler and Selina Sangal, resulting in the
cold-blooded murder of the woman’s husband,
is a satire upon civilisation ; and the verdict
of the jury which tried both murderers, and
found them guilty, and recommended the woman
to mercy, is a satire upon trial by jury. The
evidence all went to show that Selina Sangal—
sister to Thekla Dubberke, the Boot-Trunkist —
harassed and incited the somewhat sluggish Tisler
into committing the crime. He was too stagnant
to take naturally to anything so active as crime.
Tisler, apparently, resisted, by a mere dull pro-
cess of dead weight, all inducements to active
and personal murder (though, at the woman’s
instigation, lie feebly endeavored to hire an
inefficient wharf laborer to do murder for him)
till one night when he was drunk and on his way
home from Dandenong. Then the woman met
him, and gave him a stick with which to carry
out the business. Like a woman, to imagine that
a, strong man can be killed with a stick, when he
is awake, and sees the stick, and is not hit from
behind ! Then there was a struggle last-
ing nearly a quarter of an hour; children
crying in the next room; father calling out
to his boy; mother hushing him and the
others by saying that father was only having
a fight with a friend. Then, while things were
still uncertain, Tisler discovered that he had a
knife, and finished Sangal. He went away
covered with blood and full of bad rum and be-
sotted remorse. Meantime, like a tidy housewife,
Mrs. Sangal wiped the traces of her late husband
from the floor. And, by way of adding lack of
bacteriological science to their other crimes,
Sangal’s body was dropped into the well, his
slippers being left on the edge, so that the children
should fancy that their father had jumped in
casually. The Judge said that the crime was so
cold-blooded, inhuman, and fiendish as to be
without a parallel in his experience. Yet the
jury recommended the woman to mercy on the
ground that Tisler —the unfortunate criminal
German dupe of an erotic German maniac who
had, beyond question, lust and murder in her
blood —had used influence upon Mrs. Sangal.
So August Tisler will hang by the neck till
he is dead, and the woman for whose sake
he committed the crime—and who treacherously
tried to put all the blame upon him at
the trial—will be, in all probability (nomi-
nally) imprisoned for life, and at the end of 15
years or so will come into the world again
a buxom, presentable person with an interesting
Past, and possibly marry a publican, who will be
proud of her—and sleep with a revolver under his
pillow. What made the jurymen recommend the
woman to mercy ? Because they were men. Sex
influence. If the jury had been composed—or
only half composed—of women, Selina Sangal
would be hanged twice over. And this is a fruit-
ful subject for discussion by the members of
Women’s Franchise Societies. For, be it noted,
the jury did not profess to recommend Mrs.
Sangal to mercy because she was pregnant—that
is a ground for mercy which the law attends to in
any case. It simply did it because Selina was a
woman —some kind of a woman.
A Loan or a Tea-Tax.
In answer to an interjection on the Budget debate
in the Federal Parliament, Treasurer Turner
admitted that if the duty on tea, as proposed in
the Federal tariff, had been passed, there would
be no necessity for the Commonwealth to begin to
put its possessions and potentialities into pop for
the purpose of roofing an occasional post-office or
painting an old custom-house. If he gets a tea-
tax, or some equivalent impost, he can dispense
with loans; if he doesn’t, he must either borrow,
or allow necessary public works to be neglected,
or cut down the amount returned to the already
embarrassed States. A tea-tax has been proved
by experience to be an impost that does
not fall, to any appreciable extent, on the
consumer. It hits the middleman very hard, and
stands much in the way of the gentleman who
makes a fortune out of selling a mixture of fine
straw and Yang-tse-Kiang mud, and other things
that need not be mentioned, as an extra-special
Pekoe blend. But it does not haunt the break-
fast table and snatch from the wife of the poor
working man a quarter of the cup that cheers tier
through the day’s washing. The Bulletin ac-
cordingly invites the Labor Party to withdraw its
opposition to the tea-tax on condition—a condition
to which Treasurer Turner will certainly consent
—that a sum equal to the proceeds of the
duty is ear-marked for public-works pur-
poses. Such a course is possible, for the
Commonwealth does not at present use any-
thing like the quarter of the total customs revenue
to which it is entitled. The Federal Labor Party
does not believe in starting the. new national
Government with a mean little visit to the pawn-
shop. It likewise does not believe in a tea-duty.
But where one belief is weighed against the other
it will surely abandon the objection to a tea-tax.
A creditable financial position is to be bought at
the cheap price of taxing the foreign tea-pro-
ducers and the local middlemen who deal in that
disreputable grocery. It is the biggest benefit at
the smallest price that The Bulletin has ever
met with in practical politics.
The Naval Subsidy.
Premier Barton did not get his head out of the
lion’s mouth quite unscathed. He saved his
political neck, but had his ear bitten. As a
result of the Colonial Conference he comes back
pledged to recommend to the Australian Parlia-
ment a doubling (almost) of the naval subsidy.
Under the present system Australia pays to
Britain about £105,000 a year, and gets in return
nothing that is of any value. Under the new
system £200,000 a year is to be paid, and the
return will be, if possible, less. The existing
agreement gives to the Australian Government
some sort of a shadowy control oyer the fleet
in its waters, by a clause providing that the
ships are not to leave ‘ ‘ the Australian Station ”
(which station embraces nearly all the South
Pacific) without permission. But it was never
pretended that this limitation would be respected
m a time of crisis. If Britain called, the ships of
the Australian squadron would go to the Mediter-
ranean, to China, or to the English Channel. The
proposed new agreement dispenses with the
hypocrisy of the control condition, and frankly
ailows that the subsidy is to Britain’s defence, not
Australia’s. This continent can have the benefit
of the warships’ presence in peace, time; when
war breaks out they may continue in her waters
or they may not, just as it suits Britain. Obviously
this is a bad bargain for Australia. If Britain
were poverty-stricken and unable to undertake
the defence of her territory, there would be some
legitimate ground for asking for a dole from Aus-
tralia towards her navy. But that is not the
position. Australia, whilst she does not need the
services of a big navy to secure her against in-
vasion, certainly requires a few swift cruisers to
protect her coast commerce in war time against a
sudden swoop from a privateer or a vagrant war-
ship. She will have to build and man them her-
self one day, or run the risk of having her sea-
board held and her ports threatened by, perhaps,
a single vessel, while the “ Australian squadron”
is busy fighting Britain’s battles in some
other remote quarter of the globe. A noted
English publicist has stated that Britain cannot
tolerate the existence of an Australian navy, as
that would be a step towards Separation. But
that argument will hardly be pushed home when
Australia makes up her mind to lay the keel of
her first vessel, as she must do one day. The
point for Parliament to keep in mind now is that
the doubling of the subsidy to the British navy
will in no way assist Australian defence, will in
no way help to dispense with an Australian fleet,
and is purely and simply an addition to the
charity grant now paid to the rich uncle to whom
we owe so many millions.
Canadian Private Enterprise.
Chief Justice Darley, of N.S.W., recently sent
out a letter giving his impressions of Canada, and
setting forth that private enterprise, as he sees it
there, is a good thing, and he wishes Australia
had more of it. To which The Bulletin says a
cordial “Amen.” Australia wants private enter-
prise—there is nothing in all this wide world that
it wants more. Not, be it observed, pauperised
or semi-public enterprise—the kind where the
State stands the losses and the man with the
proud bell-topper takes the profits. It doesn’t
want the kind of enterprise which lives on State
concessions, such as the sole right to run tramways
through the streets of a city ; or the sole right to
supply a city with gas; or which cadges for
land-grants and pauper doles like the Canadian
Pacific Railway, and most of the private rail-
ways of this country; or negotiates free post-
age and free train swindles ; or lives on any
other kind of pauperism, beggary, or hand-
ing out of alms. It just wants private enter-
prise. The Australian of the class to which
Chief-Justice Darley belongs is, in the main, a
woefully unenterprising person. He cloaks his
want of enterprise by saying that he is hampered
by “labor legislation,” but labor legislation only
affects manufactures to any serious extent, and
this country manufactures more now than it
ever did before. It doesn’t manufacture very
much now, but it manufactures much more than
it did before there was any labor legislation.
Canada, whose prosperity so struck Mr. Darley,
took to Protection and Federation much earlier
and much more seriously than this country did.
It has had for many years by far the biggest Pro-
tectionist tariff in the British empire. It imports
less than Australia and manufactures four times
as much. In spite of all the flowery language
about Canada’s prairies and cornfields and steers,
the solemn fact remains that the value of its manu-
factures every year nearly equals that of its
agricultural products, pastoral products, wool,
beef, timber, fish, and all the other works of
Nature put together. Its manufactures have in-
creased threefold since it took to Protection in
dead earnest —took to it as even Victoria never
did ; and, consequently, private enterprise has a
chance to spread itself exceedingly at making
£40,000,000 worth of things which Australia is
content to import. It isn’t Canada’s privately-
owned railways that are pushing it along ; its
factories earn nearly twenty times as much as the
net earnings of its entire railway system ; and in
any case its privately-owned railways don’t
represent private enterprise, but are rather
examples of the great policy of cadging for
Government aid. Canada’s boom dates from the
time when it federated and established an
almost prohibitive tariff, and ejected the wretched
and unpatriotic importing tribe of M‘Millan into
oblivion. Then private enterprise got a fair
show as, it is to be hoped, it will do in Australia.
This country wants it so long as it keeps private,
and doesn’t spend its time on the Ministerial
door-mat moaning for water concessions, gas con-
cessions, tramway concessions, free postage con-
cessions, land concessions, and all kinds of loans,
monoplies, aids, subsidies, broken victuals, doles
and alms. For the kind of enterprise which
simply puts up its building and machinery and
does something, and thereby diminishes imports
and increases local employment, the opening is
unlimited, Private enterprise is one of the best
things a country can have —when it is private.
A Municipal Franchise Matter.
The franchise proposed in N.S.W. Municipal
Bill carries too many frills to be satisfactory. The
clause which deals with it consists of two sub-
clauses, 10-sub-sub-clauses, and a long procession
of sub-sub-sub-clauses; and there are in them all
enough intricacies to tie the average country
municipal clerk into a hopeless knot, and drive
the country mayor and alderman to drink. After
“ every owner m severalty of a freehold or lease-
hold interest,” and the chosen representatives
of joint owners, and the manager, secretary, or
director of a company or body corporate, and a
trustee, and the holder of a miner’s right
or business license, and a great many
other sorts of people are admitted to the
privilege of voting for Gubbins or Bloggins,
the net is cast into the sea once more and the
lodger is landed. But not every lodger.. He must
have been six months in the same lodging-house,
and the house must be worth £lO a year; also,
only one lodger may vote for every annual £lO-
- of lodgings. Which lodger ma.y vote is to
be decided by the lodgers by majority vote; so
there are possibilities of election meetings, and
faction fights, and spilled soup, and perhaps
bribery and corruption in the suburban boarding-
house. And the boarding-house, having decided
that its honor at the booth shall be main-
tained by Brown and Jones and Snooks,
such decision must be “evidenced by agreement
signed by such majority and delivered to the
clerk.” But if the boarding-house can’t agree,
then it must be “accordipg to the alphabetical
order of the surnames of the lodgers.” How the
roll can be made up without a sworn list of the
lodgers who have kept to those diggings for six
months continuously is not clear; for the clerk
must be able to rule out Robinson when he comes
to have his name put down for a £3O house, and
point to the fact that Brown and Bloggs and
Blimber are on the roll of that boarding-
house already. As to the alphabetical
business, why a person . named Walker
should not be as good a citizen and as much
entitled to vote as another lodger named
Abrahams isn’t clear either. Walker may pay
20 times more for his keep than Abrahams does
for his ; but that does not count. And perhaps
it shouldn’t ; but if it doesn’t neither should the
fact that one lodger calls himself Abrahams and
the other calls himself Walker. The Bill pro-
poses to give the man who owns £IOO,OOO worth
of freehold one vote, and it also proposes to give
one vote to the man who hires a £lO-a-year office
wherein to hide from his creditors ; and the Bill
that can take down those two at one gulp need
not be so mighty particular about straining out
the sixth lodger in the £SO house—or even the
sixteenth. The tangle which the N.S.W. Govern-
ment has put forward as a franchise gives occasion
for much irritation, and secures nothing of service
in return. For all practical purposes it is adult
suffrage under difficulties, and it would be a lot
simpler, and a lot more satisfactory, to wipe out
the whole tangle and say so.
Trades-Union Law.
The Taff Vale decision of the Judicial Committee
of the English House of Lords, if its stands good,
destroys the legal position of trades-unions in
Britain. By it, funds of a union are made liable
for any loss or damage caused by the members of
that union striking and obstructing work; and
since the object of a strike is essentially and
necessarily to damage the business of an employer,
and to cause him such loss as will force him to
agree to a union’s demands, unions must “shut
up shop.” That is an excellent reason why the
Taff Vale decision, though it is from the
highest judicial authority in England, should
not be allowed to stand as good law, even
if an Act of Parliament is necessary for its
reversal. England has tried the legal suppression
of trades-unions by Conspiracy Acts, &c., before
this, and has always found the game too dan-
gerous to be profitable to anybody. If workmen
cannot combine legitimately and remedy a griev-
ance by a strike, they take to sterner measures to
ventilate their discontent. The French Revolu-
tion taught Property for all time the danger of
suppression. When English politicians, reluctant
to learn the lesson, sought to suppress trades-
unions and to fetter the growing tendency towards
democracy, machinery-smashing, riots and Chartist
insurrections quickened their pace to reform. If,
by a legal quibble, the trades-unions of England
are now put in a position which practically pre-
vents strikes, and they are not allowed the only
workable alternative, compulsory arbitration, the
legislative remedy will need to be prompt, or
the consequences will be “ugly.” In N.S.W.,
thanks to the Arbitration Act of Attorney-General
Wise, the trades-unions are not threatened, as are
kindred organisations in Britain. By taking full
advantage of the Arbitration Act, they can secure
at once a legal status, a limitation of legal respon-
sibility, and a practical bulwark against lock-outs
or against “victimising.” It is true that, as the
price of all this, they are called upon to surrender
their strike-weapons, and must, if discontented
with wages or hours of labor, refer the dispute to
a court of justice instead of to the chances of
industrial war. But this price is hardly a penalty,
rather an additional benefit, for the strike-
weapon, necessary as it was under old conditions,
injured the workman as much as the employer,
and also, by temporarily suspending production,
injured the country at large. The Arbitration
Act of N.S.W. must, in fairness, be attributed as
much to the presence of a Labor party in Parlia-
ment as to the personal zeal and enthusiasm of its
author ; and it is a magnificent justification of that
legislative experiment. The pity is that its scope
is limited to N.S.W. and does not extend over the
whole Commonwealth.
Both* the Age and the Argus carefully suppressed
that moral drunk of Victorian Minister Bent
wherein he stated that
Mr. Alexander Peacock . . . HAD BROUGHT IN-A
SHOPS AND FACTORIES ACT WHICH HAD BEEN
THE RUIN OF THE COMMUNITY, and he had done
everything possible in it to make it impossible for certain
men to live at all.
This statement was made at Nhill after Premier
Irvine had delivered his speech, in which he
declared that the preservation of the Factories
Act was the dearest wish of the Irvine-Bent
Ministry. It was made in the presence of Premier
Irvine and Ministers Reid and Taverner. One
of the papers mentioned above had Tommy Bent’s
ghastly statement in print ready to go into the
paper, and only discovered and extinguished the
awful thing at the last moment. If it hadn’t
done so, Heaven only knows what might have
happened. Truly, the Suppress is the fourth
estate of the realm, and the pen, by reason of the
things it leaves unwritten, is mightier than the
sword.
One of the loudest roars of Victorian Railways
Minister Bent during the recent electoral cam-
paign was about what he called “a gross job.”
Now, Bent on jobs is entitled to attention —as an
admitted expert. Thomas charged the Peacock
Government with having raised the salary of the
Chief Inspector of Factories from £2OO to £520
just before it was ousted. Next day even Bent’s
friend, the Argus, without troubling to ask
Peacock for his version of the matter, explained
that the Inspector had merely been promoted from
the 2nd class, at £440, to the.lst class, at £->2O, by
the Public Service Commissioner, on the recom-
mendation of the Under-Secretary, and that said
promotion was duly endorsed by the Peacock
Government. The fact that Peacock was de-
feated that day was merely a coincidence. The
Argus gently hinted that Bent ought to be
muzzled till after polling-day. Another suggestion
is that Bent ought to be declared a noxious-trade
site.
♦
Melbourne Argus logic :
At last meeting of the Labor Political Council the
chairman declared that the way to square the finances
was to impose a land-tax. Mr. Sanostbr, Mr. Prender-
gast, and other Labor members make the same assertion.
The party seems unanimous on the point. The finances
must be squared in some way, and this is their plan.
Land is valued by the money it brings in. Lower the
income by Is. per annum, and you lower the capital
value accordingly. A tax of £500,000 represents a capital
value of £12,500,000 ; consequently, to impose such a tax
would depreciate the value of land in Victoria by
£12,500,000. To depreciate land values in this manner
during a period of great suffering through drought would
be a national calamity. Will the electors vote for a heavy
land-tax to support existing extravagance, or will they
vote for the strictest and most far-reaching economy first,,
any new taxation to be minimised to the utmost and to
apply to people all round ? These are the only two
policies before the electors.
Which slab of sophistry might be paraphrased
thus:
Labor is valued by the money it brings in. Lower the
income by Is. per annuum and you lower the capital
value accordingly. A tax of £75,000 on labor represents
a capital value ‘of £1,875,000; consequently to impose
such a tax would depreciate the value of labor in Victoria
by £1,875,000. To depreciate labor values in this manner
during a period of great suffering through drought would
be a national calamity.
It reads quite as well that way as the other.
How long Tasmania intends to endure its Upper
House would be a question of merely speculative
interest if the imminent dangers to Apple Land
from its existence were not so great. There is a
sort of vague superstition in the country that the
Upper House has often saved the island from the
rashness of the Lower House, and that it is a very
useful, hard-working institution. Exactly what
rashness it has checked (if you can imagine the
“other place” indulging in rashness, except as
regards expenditure) no one has as yet found out.
The trouble is that there should be a retiring age
for legislators as well as for any other public ser-
vants. The members of the Tasmanian Upper
House have, most of them, one claim to respect
only, and that is the appendage they possess in
common with the billy-goat. During the present
session, the Upper House has rejected an Assess-
ment Bill, which might have improved the assess-
ment of land-values for taxation purposes; a Con-
stitution Bill, which might have improved the
Legislature, partly by getting rid of a separate
Upper House; and an Employers’ Liability Bill;
and it will, no doubt, reject an Income-tax Bill,
which is brough t forward with what most men would
regard as the laudable object of making up the
deficiency out of revenue instead of out of loan
moneys. Certainly, the Tasmanian Upper House
has checked hasty legislation this year, if there
was any, for it has thrown out practically every-
thing.
Preacher Bevan, who lately went up to Queens-
land and-guzzled from the fleshpotsof the rich land-
owners, and listened attentively to their side of
the case, assures the public that the friction be-
tween the Federal Parliament and the Philp
Government at Brisbane arises through Queens-
land being represented in the Commonwealth
Parliament by “class legislators.” The Federal
members, elected by the whole manhood of
Queensland, are thus “classlegislators,” while the
Assembly at Brisbane, elected on a franchise by
which one property-owner may have a dozen
votes, represents the genuine, solid, undeniable
will of the people ! Yet Preacher Bevan would
probably be shocked if the Labor party denounced
the church as a sordid and purchaseable institu-
tion whose support can be bought for rich food
and social recognition. It takes a good deal of
solid front to describe the members who are
chosen by the whole community, voting on an
absolutely equal basis, as “ class legislators ”; but
the church has any amount of that. It is difficult
to say whether the before or behind view of the
church is the more objectionable from the demo-
cratic pffint of view. The front is mostly put up with
the subscriptions of wealthy brewers and sweaters,
and the tail at the back has been lent out for many
years at a reasonable figure to wipe unclean
hands and to wipe up unclean jobs till the whole
church influence is at so low an ebb now that its
support is hardly worth securing.
The failure of cabman Hannah to get his claim
for damages against the Federal Government
heard, owing to the want of a Federal Court,
formed the subject of a debate in N.S.W.
Assembly. It was chiefly notable for the acrid
attacks on all things Federal by several of the
ultra-provincial spirits, who seem to regard the
Barton Ministry, as someone appositely inter-
jected, in the light of a foreign Government. It
was clearly shown that the Postmaster-General
honestly tried to dodge round the legal difficulties
in the way, but the N.S.W. Judge decided that
the law was too strong for him, and declined to
hear his case. The Federal Government, which
has three N.S.W. members in it, would probably
have passed the legislation constituting the Federal
Court by this time but for the obstruction to the
passage of the tariff by the N.S.W. section of
Parliament. Anyhow, Australia is beginning to
be tired of the continual grizzle that the Federal
House has not passed all necessary legislation in
one session. The N.S.W. Assembly itself has
talked about a Local Government Bill for 40 years.
It shows signs of being tired of even talking about
it, let alone passing it.
London Star item :
The Central News conveys from Johannesburg the
interesting fact that the Standard and Diggers’ News
has been acquired by Messrs. Harmswortii and Freeman
Cohen. This is indeed good news for the mining em-
ployees of the Rand, black and white. Of old the
Standard and Diggers’News used to champion the cause
of the white miners against the mine-owners, who were
always hankering after a reduction of miners’ wages. It
will not commit any blunder of that sort under the
control of Mr. Freeman Cohen. The Freeman Cohen
group consists of Rand mining companies, with a capital
before the war of two and a half millions sterling. Mr.
H. Freeman Coiien was the Anglo-Saxon who originally
floated, in conjunction with Messrs. Wernher, Beit and
Co., the Crown Deep Mine. Then there is Mr. Samuel
Cohen, his brother, and a Mr. L. Gilau. If the interests
of the British Empire are not safe in these hands, where
are we to look for safety? The purchase will be very
grateful to Lord Milner, since it removes from the
Transvaal the last daily newspaper independent of the
mining bosses. All the others are under the thumb of
Beit and De Beers ; and now the last loophole of
publicity by which the truth about the Transvaal might
escape is plugged.
The oppressed Britons for whom we fought—how
their fine old Anglo-Saxon names keep cropping
up : Beit, Wernher, Freeman Cohen, Samuel
Cohen, L. Gilau, and the rest 1

„ to advertised arrangements the
Chinese Honeymoon ” will have taken its indefi-
nite presence from Sydney Royal before these
facts get into print. The next happening at the
Oastlereagh-street house is supposed to be “ Sher-
lock Holmes.” That tall, pale, impassive man
with the cameo-like features on his head and the
6 In- ou t °f his carpet bag is due on October
11. Till he arrives to show how the thing ought
to be done the local detective will get along as
best lie can on the old lines, and look for informa-
tion in threepenny bars and over back fences as of
old. The Bulletin is not complaining about the
meal ’tec. The man who invented Sherlock
Holmes supplied him, first, with an imposing
name (he might have been born Buggins), and,
secondly, with a nice series of clean-cut cases, with
a large crime at one end and a large motive
at tne other, and Sherlock followed the thread that
led from one to another. And the ordinary ’tec
spends half his time in struggling with cases in
W m,t 1 was home tight at a late hour,
and 1 hompson and Brown hit him on the head
with a bottle and left. They had never seen
Smith before, and Smith didn’t see them then,
for the bottle struck him from behind. There
was no motive to trace; Thompson and Brown
had no previous thought of assaulting Smith, but
they had just picked up a bottle and didn’t know
what else to do with it. The bottle had only been
m their possession a minute or two, and conveyed
no information whatever as to their habits or
whereabouts. Sherlock Holmes toiling up Oxford-
street, Sydney, in a dust-storm in pursuit of the
commonest variety of local crime, which generally
has a bottle in it, would probably be an ineffective
and dispirited spectacle.

“ Belle of New York'’ will be silenced
this week at Sydney Palace and give place to the
‘‘Messenger Boy,” a musical comedy unknown to
the Australian public so far, but spoken of with
enthusiasm in London and other back-blocks
centres.

The besmirched character of Baker is still
residing at the old address (Sydney Lyceum), and
gets purified every night by someone riding
violently on a stationary bicycle to a moving goal.
There are no changes in the bill, except that the
orchestra, during an interval, is sometimes
accompanied with a dog obligato, and that the
dog aforesaid shows an increasing desire to rescue
the villain, being held back by moral principles
and Bland Holt. The real water and the unreal
bicycle, race are as good as ever. “Riding to
Win ” is in its last nights, but its successor is not
yet announced.

“ Mrs. Goldstein,” at Sydney Criterion,
continues to impress Charles Kenningham as
being the very mother-in-law his soul had hun-
gered for, and the male portion of the audience
continues to like that bright and breezy lady very
well—on the stage. There is absolutely nothing
new about the mother -in - law in Sheridan’s
comedy, neither in the dialogue nor in the lyrics.
Writer doesn’t remember more than one bright
remark about this aspersed female in all English
literature, and that was made by Edgar Allan
Poe, when he stated that as he loved his wife
more than himself, therefore he ought to love his
wife’s mother more than his own—which sounds
like a sum. in Rule of Three, done into poetry.
The Criterion matinee happens next week on
Monday instead of the usual Wednesday.

At the Sydney Tivoli the programme is
very much the same as before, and there is an air
of hushed expectation because of the coming of
Sandow next Saturday. Just now, perhaps, the
main point of interest is the bioscope presentment
of King Ned’s coronation. Of course, the pictures
may not represent that ceremony at all, but only
the full-dress rehearsal, or even, perhaps, a care-
fully fixed-up imitation in a cinematograph gal-
lery. Most bioscope pictures of historic ceremonies
are “fakes,” and one of the most lurid strikes on
record in America was caused by the Boers, who
had to fight (before the bioscope) the battle of Glen-
coe, demanding a dollar a day extra for wounded
feelings, etc., because they had to flee from the
goldarned Britisher. But the Tivoli presentment
of the Coronation looks genuine enough, and
shows an exceedingly bald and tired King taking
his oil with, meekness and submitting to his
swaddling clothes like a good baby.

A pressman writes from Maoriland :
Torrey, of the jarring twang, is booming round here
like a stray cannon from the arsenal of Armageddon.
His success is abnormal, and nobody protests except one
Christchurch paper, which has been shooting brickbats
and slugs and nails at the twangful one for days, without
result. Torrey’s advance agents urged the Government
to provide cheap trains, as it did for race-meetings.
Government could not see the force of the argu-
ment, but Torrey worked his point later on, and
unkempt shufflers chewing straws wandered in from
the cowsheds and turnips to get grace. Torrey is an
amusing joke to most of us, however. I went with a
fellow pressman to one meeting, and found thousands
blocked out of the hall. Our press tickets passed us in
and two inky sinners were ushered up to Torrey’s feet
He broke off in the middle of an exhortation to “get
right aout of the path t’en’less cor-ruption. Repent
t’night! repent naow I ” to welcome the sinful
ones. “ Are you reporters ? Glaad t’see yer.
Gahd bless yer.” Chairs, owing to the throng, were
slow a-coming, the sinful two meanwhile standing
unabashed in sight of 4000 people, with Torrey
bellowing his loudest. My ear was one inch off his
Broadway-toed boot, and I could see his feet quiver with
his own yells. Still no chairs came. Torrey exhorted
roarfully. Alexander broke in with a loud and cheerful
yell : “ Say, there’s two reporters want chairs. Get wan,
somebody ; get two, in fahct.” Torrey, still thundering,
broke off : “All right, Charley, th’ chairs will be here right
naow,”—and sailed on in his sermon like an unchecked
Niagara. Alexander is pleasant and vulgar. Torrey
is vulgar and unpleasant, and has a voice that sounds
like an aggravated elephant. The penitent stool (we were
about a foot off it) was an awful sight. It was occupied
by the most degenerate and atavistic, the most animally
dull set of converts you ever saw. Torrey said “ Gahd
bless you !”as we left, but he said it as if lie had to. His
mid-day talks to business men are attended by the frowsy
tramps who want a change from the Police Court, and
by women. General verdict is “ Same old religion.”
Torrey, by the way, says that an old friend, A. B.
Worthington, was the same Unitarian minister whom he
exhorted hahnestly and cahndidly for four days, like
(sic) a lawyer would,” and who did not repent. “He is
naow in trouble. Guess y’ know him raound these pahts,”
says Torrey. I really think that if things were the other
way about, and Worthington was preaching about Torrey
being in trouble, Worthington wouldn’t do it so horribly
through his nose as Torrey does.

The initial Melba concert, at Melbourne
Town Hall, did not fall due until 8.15 p.m. last
Saturday, but the audience was packed luce a box
of fish on the ground floor by 8 o’clock. The
chairs were many, and the space between the rows
so limited that, when a tardy vice-regal person
arrived, and the Anthem bluffed the multitude
into standing up, the task of sitting down again
became difficult in some cases. This seems to
explain why the same people didn’t “spring to
their feet” some half-hour later, when Melba
took the platform. The management hadn’t
given them sufficient room for a graceful spon-
taneous movement. Moreover, the introductory
items on the programme had somewhat chilled
their enthusiasm. Australian enthusiasm easily
takes cold, especially when it has paid a guinea in
advance.
* * * *
The introductory items were not exciting.
Madame Albani, of yore, travelled with a more
effective co. than this. The Melba support con-
sists of three instrumental accompanists and two
men singers, one of whom, Louis Arens, is remem-
bered as a good Wagnerian tenor, with a short,
thick voice. He is heard at his best in heavy
German music of the kind that loses color when
torn from its operatic setting and sung by a
swallow-tailed tenor in cold blood. The dramatic
baritone, Signor or Monsieur Bensaude, has a
pood appearance and a satisfactory voice, but he
is not up to the concert “form” of a William
Pauli. The flautist, Mr. Griffith, plays an obli-
gato indifferently well when required. It seemed
a pity to require him on Saturday. A casual
matter-of-fact lady who supplies a piano solo, as
well as accompaniments, would be quite uninterest-
ing but for her gait and general demeanor. She
bustles up to the piano, rubbing her hands, like a
rural schoolmistress about to punish the instru-
ment for its impudence. Signorina Sassoli,
harpist, touches the strings very tenderly, and is,
doubtless, an exceptional performer for her age.
All the same, a solo by a 15-year-old harpist is not
quite worth bringing from Europe.
* * • *
So the concert had gone slow up to the
time for Melba’s first effort. The Star was No. 5
on the programme. It remained for her to put a
smile of contentment on that sea of countenances.
She was asked to sing up to the public expectation
of Melba and she Got There—or thereabouts.
Those who had expected her to warble better than
the angels may complain that she was not a
miracle, but they can hardly deny her excellence as
a professional soprano. Melba and her voice have
been misrepresented by Australians who heard her
in Europe, and wrote of her as a somewhat
inanimate artist, with a brilliant voice of hard
quality. The Melba who sang on Saturday was
remarkable for the refined richness and roundness
of her notes, and her opening number, the “Mad
Scene” (abbreviated) from “Lucia,” was given
with bewitching effect. The voice is lovely in her
mezzo singing, and still lovely when she lets it
go. But Melba is not versatile. She was
born and educated for florid Italian music.
“ Home, Sweet Home ” has been more pleasingly
sung by second-rate artists. Perhaps the
returned wanderer was striving too bard for
emotion in her treatment of the tiresome
old ballad, or perhaps the “Lucia” number
sung under exacting conditions, had “taken it
out ”of her. Afterwards Melba was herself again
in two sweet little songs, and then she scored a
triumph.with the “Traviata” test number, “Ah
fors e Ini ” —a triumph positive, comparative, and
superlative. But again the encore song was not a
success. No matter. Her audience had beard
the great singer do great work. To-night (Thurs-
day) is the third Melba night. On Saturday the
fourth concert, and on Tuesday (7th) the last of
the series.
** * *
“A Little Ray of Sunshine,” which
beamed at Melbourne Princess last Saturday
evening, has its points of superiority to other
farcical comedies. The “Ray” is a long-lost or
mislaid uncle, and a lord at that, who, having
returned home from Australia on the eve of bis
niece’s wedding, is mistaken for all sorts and con-
tions of people. He spends nearly all the first act
in being thrown out of a door on the prompt
side, followed by his impedimenta, and
swiftly coming back again through the same
door. Then he settles down to the habit of being
mistaken for somebody else. He is introduced to
the ladies, who have already mistaken him for the
broker’s man, as three different and distinct in-
dividuals. Dobbs, the money-lender who bas Sir
Philip in his toils, mistakes 'him for Sir Philip
Sir Philip and his nephew take him to be Dobbs.
From these orthodox complications the humor
flows. Of course, the Ray from Austra-
lia discovers all about the money-lending
transaction which threatens the happiness
of everyone, and relieves the situation of the
pressure of the hook-nosed lender. Some senti-
ment which blushes at intervals through the
revels, possibly at its own temerity at being found
there or being found out, is not convincing in it-
self, but as it is an essential part of the story and
adds piquancy and flavor to the humor it is
acquitted without a stain upon its character.
** * *
The genial old shuttlecock who chuckles
delightedly over eacli new development and
adapts himself cheerfully to every circumstance,
whether it be playing honey-pots in the
kitchen as the supposed uncle of the housemaid,
perambulating with the wedding-cake, or “putting
down ” the wine at the instance of Lady Dorothy,
gives fine opportunities to a mercurial and mag-
netic comedian like Frank Thornton. He makes
much of the part. If the expression of pathos is
somewhat wanting in body the responsibility for
lack of tonnage must equally be shared between
actorand character. The other parts make but little
demand upon intelligent actors. They ask for
nothing more than brisk and breezy treatment,
and they get all that is needed, or nearly all. A
good deal of the fun is supplied by John Denton,
as a budding youth with premature claims to
manhood, in his oafish love passages with a
maiden of tender years who has no other visible
occupation. The first-night house was not much
more than half-full, a poor reception for such a
bright and attractive visitor as Thornton.
** * *
The three red-headed men who rage
individually and collectively in blue-and-white
socks of the same pattern will retain their present
disguises at Melbourne Bijou until Friday night.
“Tom, Dick, and Harry” is the bright, passable
farce that it was some months ago, also a “ High-
land Legacy ” seems none the worse for having
Hammond in the part of the young lodger on
the third floor. In fact, Hammond is an improve-
ment on the previous young man in the garret,
but the Scotch accent of the Laird o’ Auchty
Lochty (or however he spells it) continues to be a
satire on his kilts. Next Saturday (4th) the Haw-
trey co. will revive “A Message from Mars,”
the pretty little moral story of how Parker fell
asleep and enjoyed a horrible nightmare.
** # *
At Her Majesty’s the nights of “ Sherlock
Holmes” are numbered. Moriarty will have
ceased to breathe bloodshed down the tube ere
the next issue of The Bulletin bursts into bloom.
Cuyler Hastings and all people concerned with
him in the Conan Doyle drama have won the
respect of the less unintelligent classes. Never-
theless, the anticipated “ Sherlock ” boom has not
assumed dimensions worthy of the occasion.
** * *
At Melbourne Royal the dreary woes of a
misjudged female who suffers from “The World
Against Her ” will woe for the last time to-night
(Thursday), after which Anderson’s hard-working
co. is to take up its tons of scenery and seek other
pastures for a while. But inasmuch as Anderson
has renewed his lease of the theatre from Bland
Holt until Easter next, the same co. will be back
presently. To-morrow (Friday) Mrs. G-. B. Lewis
has the theatre for her great jubilee corroboree of
classic drama, old comedy, &c., and on Saturday
a Maggie Moore season will begin. The original
intention of the Only Maggie was to produce her
broad comedy, “ The Widow from Japan.” Mel-
bourne being rather loaded up with comedy just
now, the intentions of Miss M.M. have changed
their course, and she will re-appear at the old
place as a certain renowned Dutch girl in “ Struck
Oil.”

The final expansion of Sandow’s chest and
the valedictory upraising of Sandow’s dumb-
bells will happen at Melbourne Opera House to-
night (Thursday) if the shapely strong man has
not already said farewell. When gone he will
not be forgotten. The body of Sandow passes to
another State, but he leaves his System behind
him. Also, he leaves a gap in the programme at
Rickards’s which will need careful filling for the
next week or two. Then Melbourne’s old friend,
Cinquevalli, comes along, and the cannon-ball
booms again.

Williamson’s Comic Opera co., under
Henry Bracy’s guidance, has been doing well at
Adelaide Royal. “The Circus Girl” is one of
the plays written in London round a very small
man—much smaller than Lauri; but the latter
looks trivial enough when he gets alongside the
Terrible Kelly, imported from Melbourne regard-
less of expense. The scenes in the circus are well
contrived, but there’s too much talk, and some of
the proprietor’s lines suggest that it was in a
moment of unexpected candor that the authors hit
on the name Drivelli. Florence Young sings and
acts well, but she resembles many other things
more than a convent-schoolgirl. Lauri and
Carrie Moore do some rather fine opera-singing,
giving a doubtless lifelike imitation of certain
persons unknown. Since then, the always useful
“Dorothy” has been revived, with a tenor,
Reginald Roberts, only just arrived in Australia.
“ lolanthe ” to follow, after which the first pro-
duction upon this continent of “The Toreador.”
Meanwhile, Dolores has taken a last vocal farewell
of Adelaide, under the wing of the Liedertafel
Society. And, Rickards pursuing his new policy
of subletting the Tivoli, Sweet Nell and King
Charles and the Dog have descended for a short
season upon that small but convenient house, and
conferred a new glory upon it.

Charles (“Daddy”) Woodroffe, the original
Australian Glass-blower, died at Melbourne Hos-
pital, last week, aged 71. One of the best known
and best respected old showmen in Victoria was
Woodroffe, a genuine artist at his craft, and a
kindly charitable fellow. The art of fancy glass-
blowing must have been in the family since the
beginning of last century. Woodroffe was the
pupil of his father, an Englishman, who estab-
lished his business in America, and died there.
Son Charles left his native ’Murka when a young
man, and roamed the world before coming to this
country. He made a lot of money in his time,
and gave a lot away. He used to speak with
pride of his success in the English glass-
making towns, where his little show—so he had
been warned—would inevitably fall as dead as a
sack of coals in Newcastle. Woodroffe braved the
glassworkers in their strongholds, and fairly
“knocked” them. Outside of his business
Woodroffe claimed the distinction of having been
the first subject to take ether for a tooth opera-
tion. The honor of discovering anaesthesia by the
inhalation of sulphuric ether is credited to Dr.
Morton, of Boston, who brought the novelty into
practice in 1840. Woodroffe, senior, submitted
his 15-year-old boy C liar ley to the test, and
Charley came out of it minus a back tooth.

“L.8.E.” on gagging :
The management of “ A Chinese Honeymoon ” in Eng-
land recently sacked Lionel Rignold, who played Pine-
apple, for introducing “gags” into the piece. Rignold
took the case to court and secured £4OO damages, though
manager Curzon, author George Dance, and stage-
director Hunt all testified that Rignold’s gags were
“ unworthy of the piece.” (Great Heavens ! unworthy
of the dreadful “ Chinese Honeymoon” !) The gag is an
ancient and honorable institution. Musical comedies are
written, or left unwritten, for the benefit of the smart
gagger. The French, the most scrupulous and punc-
tilious of all mummers, would never dream of gagging in
a serious work, but they have absolutely full licence
in works of a light and frivolous order. Arthur Roberts
and Dan Leno gag their whole parts. George Lauri
is a great but not particularly witty gagger, most
of his wheezes being verbal eccentricities. Claude
Bantock gags freely and genially, and Hugh Ward’s many
gags have a distinctly brainy flavor. Carrie Moore is
the only Australian actress who is not afraid to gag.
“ Teddy ” Lauri is an incorrigible gagger, and has managed
to pull through two hopeless parts, the Secretary in
“ Thirty Thieves” and Pineapple in the “Honeymoon.”
There were some strange gags in “ Robin Hood ” (period,
the 12th century). Lauri wanted to know if Robin
played bridge ; Bantock called for a tripe sandwich, and
referred to Ward as “ Little Lord Fauntleroy ” ; and Hugh
Ward wanted a milk shandy. In the Elizabethan drama
most of the comic stuff was pure (or impure) gagging ;
even the First Gravedigger in “ Hamlet ” gagged his part.
In “The Rivals,” Acres’ misquotation of Sir Lucius’ letter
—“ To prevent the trouble that might arise from our
both undressing the same lady is a gag that has
become classic. It is impossible to dissever the gag from
the theatre. It belongs to the comedian as rant to the
tragedian. It is probably as old as the drama itself, and
when it is kept to its own province it sometimes serves
to relieve the monotony of a dull play,

June, 1902, were £11,359,992, and the total outgoing's

A few small surpluses and a gorgeous collection of
huge deficits ! This year’s deficit, by the way, should
appear as about £360,000, but it is partly disguised by
using certain trust funds in connection with the resumed
area of Sydney as revenue.
The surpluses have always been manufactured
in two ways—by treating as revenue money received for
the sale of the State’s assets in the shape of public lands,
and by charging all manner of temporary and wholly
unproductive works (including even such things as
salaries and interest on loans) to loan expenditure. How
the latter swindle has been growing is shown roughly in
periods in Ooohlan’s “ Statistics of the Six States of
Australia and Maoriland ” :
Unproductive Loan Expenditure in N.S.W.
Total Average
Unproductive per
Expenditure. year.
1870-74 (5 years) £677,207 £i35,441
1875-79 ( „ ) 635,799 127,160
1880-84 ( „ ) 894,742 178,948

1900-1901 (2 „ ) 1,886,377 943,189
!902 (1 year) about 960,000
These sums are really additional deficits paid out of
loans. Loans are supposed to be for “ permanent and
reproductive works these represent works or jobs or
frauds that are wholly non-productive, and which are
charged to loans to make the disgraceful public accounts
look better. The interest on these sums has to be met
out of taxation, there being no corresponding public
works to produce the interest. If the process continues
a memorable breakdown is inevitable. The common reply
to such prophecies is : “ We have heard all that before, but
the country still keeps going along pretty well.” But
the present riot only really began about 1885, and it only
assumed a very bad form about 1890, and the collapse is
hardly due yet. Australia’s insane land boom lasted
about 20 years and then burst, just when people were
saying that it had gone on so long that only professional
pessimists could suppose it would have an end. Austra-
lia’s banking boom lasted about 20 years, and then burst.
The present borrowing boom for revenue-faking pur-
poses has lasted about 17 years, and it will burst.
And the above figures don’t represent anything
like the full size of the disaster. They only deal with the
money that actually reached N.S.W. and was spent here.
But, in addition, there is a huge unproductive expenditure
through floating loans at 3 per cent, when the State’s
credit is only equal to borrowing at per cent. The
State gives its 1.0. U. for £4,000,000 and only receives,
perhaps, £3,680,000; and the £320,000 lost (which is
really interest paid out of loans) has to be added to the
unproductive loan expenditure to get the true figures.
Last year something like £1,300,000 of debt was incurred
in N.S.W. with no reproductive works to show for it.
During the last 12 months N.S.W. spent,
£5,028,805 of borrowed money. Its debts, at this datel
are about £79,000,000, and, in addition, the amounts stil
owing for the purchase of properties in the resumed area
of Sydney—something like £6O a head. And the fact
that this isn’t anything like the worst Australasian record
doesn’t make the outlook any brighter.

Wilfley Concentrators are now to be found on
almost every mine of importance in the Commonwealth,
their intrinsic merits placing them far ahead of all com-
petition. The Austral Otis Engineering company of
South Melbourne and sole Australasian manufacturers,
report that over 500 of the tables are now in daily use in
Australia, and the sales increasing. In America the
Wilfley is eclipsing all competing concentrating devices,
more than 4500 having already been sold. The Great
Anaconda mine, Montana, alone has upwards of 400 tables
in use, having discarded all other machines. The output
and sales of the Denver factory alone is now averaging 5
tables per day, or close on 2000 concentrators per annum.
The great popularity of these tables is due to their great
capacity, 20 tons per day, simplicity of operation, and
wide range of adjustment, as well as perfection of work
done, which makes them suitable for treating any class of
ore that can be concentrated. Full particulars, catalogues
etc., can be obtained on application to the Australian

A Melbourne mining man has received word
from a friend in Johannesburg that he is returning from
South Africa in disgust. He finds it is useless to prospect
or to peg out mineral lands as he cannot get a title of
any kind whatever. It is unlikely the Government will
have framed its mining regulations much before the New
Year. The Victorian adds that the mining laws will be
drafted by Cohen, and passed into law by Cohen, for
Cohen is greater far than Milner, yea, than even Chamber-
lain. Johannesburg he describes as a city of bottle noses,
bugs and booze.

The Federal Government is making another
attempt to get authority for its £500,000 loan, almost
every penny of .which ought to be charged to revenue,
being for repairs to old, worn-out public works (con-
structed out of loans and never paid for). If this iniquity
succeeds, the Commonwealth will have seven Govern-
ments, all borrowing money on the personal security of
less than 4,000,000 people, and dozens of local bodies
doing the same. The reason assigned for the proposed
loan is that, if these repairs are charged to revenue,
the amount returned to the States will be so seriously
diminished that they will be reduced to great straits.
In that case either the Federal Government or the States
should raise sufficient extra revenue to prevent the
embarrassment ; and the Federal Government, having
more sources of revenue at command than the States,
had better set the example. Every country is embar-
rassed which doesn’t raise enough taxation to cover its
outgoings.

he points to the fact that about half of the mines that

The circular recently issued by the London
directorate of the Duke United mine (Vic.) is a
shocking example of wild exaggeration, for which
there can be only one explanation. That is, the
assumption that there is a desire to unduly inflate
the value of shares. The mine is undoubtedly
a good one; it is capitalised in the moderate
amount of £lOO,OOO, and the strong probability is that
when it ends its career it will show a return of all the
capital and substantial interest added. On its merits the
property represents a fair mining investment at about
par. Regarded in this light, it needs no mendacity to
bolster it up. On the circular showing, the property
ought to be worth ten times its capital, and, doubtless,
the intention is to try to induce unsophisticated out-
siderB to take this view. According to the document, the
whole of the capital is to be returned within three
years, and an elaborate estimate is made to
show that the mine will live for 20 years and
be a consistent profit - earner throughout the term.
All this looks well in print, but it is based on totally
erroneous premises. It is assumed that the lead is 900 ft
wide for the whole length of the property, and that it is
good for an ounce per fathom right through. It would
probably be nearer the mark to make the average width
less than 200 ft. An average yield of loz. per fathom
would be contrary to all local experience. Further pro-
gressive work in the mine will entail very heavy’ con-
tinuous expenditure, and this must be provided for out
of profits. Bull probably has a2O per cent, mine to run
and if he expects anything beyond that he is going to be
disappointed.

Star of the East, Ballarat (Vic.) last half-year
crushed 20,628 tons for 86110 z., value £34,308. On book-
keeping accounts it showed a profit of £11,139. Directors’
report indicates excellent prospects at various points in
the mine, and it really looks as though Ballarat is at last
to have a permanent profit-earning mine as distinguished
from the will-o’-the-wisp which pays divs. one month and
makes calls the next. Star l directors and managers are to
be complimented on the systematic manner in which
they have prospected and developed the mine to ensure
if possible, a regular output for a considerable time to
come. Most important feature is that the 2200 ft level is
showing up well.
J. Gavan Reilly,” who writes from South Mel-
bourne to a London paper, is a gentleman gifted with a
mighty imagination. The burden of his song is that
Creswick (Vic.) is the greatest goldfield on earth. It has,
he says, “ produced more gold than any other field in the
world,” which is a fair sample of two columns of state-
ments which, read seriously, would make the Sphinx wake
up. “ All the mining on the wash dirt deposits of this
great watershed has been confined to its headlands and
tributaries, and the main and buried stream (which con-
tains fabulous gold deposits) remains untouched.” Ores-
wick men wil| be horrified when'they learn that the great
Berry gutter in which they have been working for years
is only a minor tributary of a buried main stream. Reilly
is anxious that English capitalists should send out
sundry millions to exploit the reefs and alluvial leads
of this wondrous field, and he guarantees—in print—
that they will get a handsome return on the money. Lest
they should have any difficulty in selecting a man to
supervise the mammoth enterprise contemplated, Reilly
modestly proclaims that he is prepared to give every
assistance, and as he has “a full knowledge of every
gully, abandoned rush, lead, outcrop, lode, and possible
spot for prospecting in the whole of the district,” his ser-
vices would, unquestionably, be of incalculable value.
But those millions are still in England, and Reilly will
continue to sleep on his marvellous knowledge unless he
is prepared, as any sensible man would be, to set to work
on some of the “ rich leaders that hold more gold than
stone.”

Few Victorians are aware how much they
owe to Mr. A. H. Howitt, the veteran explorer (now
quietly living at Caulfield) in connection with the State’s
coal-mining laws. In England, many years ago, it was
decided in Parliament that coal belonged exclusively to
the owner of the land on which it was discovered. The
result is that, for a great number of years, the
English have been paying enormous sums in royalties
to the proprietors of English coal-mines, one landlord
exacting no less than ±40,000 per annum blackmail
from mines worked on his land. When coal
seams were discovered in Korrumburra and other
parts of Victoria, a number of persons at once began
to buy up land in these districts, in the hope of securing
a good royalty, as in England. But Howitt, who was
then Secretary for Mines, scented the danger, and while
helping to draft the Bill relating to mines, inserted a
clause to the effect that if A found coal on B’s land he
could work the mine by recompensing B for the surface
damage only. The clause was passed by Parliament
without any discussion ; apparently it escaped notice.
Its true inwardness was discovered later on, and the
things that were said about Howitt by the landlord class
were not fit to be mentioned. His Act has done Victoria
much good, but some large landed proprietors curse even
now when they pass Howitt’s front gate and remember
that the Base Incendiary lives within.

In 1900 the Queensland Parliament gave sub-
stantial concessions to the Callide Coal Syndicate (Glad-
stone). The syndicate is already on the job again with
an Amending Bill that asks for : (1) Two years’ exten-
sion ; (2) Power to alter its railway guage from 3ft. 6in.
to 2ft. 6in. ; and (3) for ten acres of the foreshores of
Barney's Point, Port Curtis— said to be the finest wharf-
age site in the famous harbor of Gladstone. The Bill
will probably pass, as Philp and co. have counted the
large, upstanding ears of their followers. And if someone
laid an information against the syndicate for begging in
a public place, nothing would happen. The Callide co.
said, in 1900, that it was going to put the line down
straight away. “Janny” Leahy says the sturdy coal
mendicant isn’t asking for too much, so probably the
Ohillagoe and Cloncurry crowds will come along shortly
with their little lots.

Owing to the grumblings of the Accident In-
surance companies at the alleged unprofitableness of the
business done at Charters Towers, the mining companies
have decided to run their own accident insurance fund :
rates, 6d per week, with 275. 6d. a week in cases of dis-
ablement, and £75 in case of fatality. Moreover, the in-
surance covers the 24 hours, barring accidents arising
from sport, drunkenness, or fighting. Hitherto the acci-
dent insurance companies have only insured against
injuries received at work. The miners have an associa-
tion of their own with a membership of 1100 or so, and
pay 255. weekly for accidents and £5O for death.

Golden Link Consols (W. A. ) has bought a 10-
head battery from the Wealth of Nations for its Eclipse
lease. This battery was originally erected on the Golden
Crown, Kanowna, and when that wild cat fizzled out was
transferred to the Wealth of Nations. One month’s run
on the latter was sufficient to demonstrate that the mine
was most inappropriately named, and the plant has been
idle ever since. Golden Link people cannot be super-
stitious, or they would certainly give such an unlucky
battery a very wide berth. They are evidently riding for
a fall, and are nearly certain to have it. All the gold
which will come from the Eclipse is hardly likely to lift
the 550,000 shares of the Golden Link out of the rut which
leadeth to destruction.

Sub-manager Gleisberg, of the Associated (W. A.),
attributes the poor extraction of 18dwt. from 26dwt.
ore to bad roasting, and recommends new roasters. The
two Ropp furnaces now in use have had quite an eventful
history. Their crowns were raised after having caved in
owing to excessive heat. Subsequently they were lowered
to increase their capacity. Now they are condemned
because they cannot give a “ sweet” roast. Ivanhoe and
Horseshoe have proved conclusively that batteries can
treat Kalgoorlie sulphide ores successfully for 12s. 9d. a
ton against 21s. to 255. and upwards by Diehl and furnace
processes. In addition, the initial cost of a battery is
much less, and its life much longer, than a furnace plant.
This quaint advt. is now appearing: “ Draught horses,
drays and harness for sale on account of starting new
machinery for handling firewood.” It has taken the
Associated eight years to discover the inefficiency and
expensiveness of horses, although the Kalgurli, alongside,
has been using steam trams for years.

Lake View Consols (W.A.) driving north on
supposed Perseverance lode at 700 ft. Lode 3£ft. wide
and worth 30dwt., but north boundary is so near that
development is of very little account. If the lode were
to trend south the position would be different. During
August, plant treated 6388 tons for 66060 z. Working
costs are given as 38s. 6d., but this includes nothing for
development, repairs, royalty, etc., and is therefore
wholly misleading. Co. is doing about 750 ft. of develop-
ment monthly, or nearly double that of any other co.
The minimum cost would be £4OOO, or 12s. 6d. per tori
treated. Royalty is Is. 9d. This brings total exs. up to
525. 9d., exclusive of depreciation and English charges
and taxes. Latest advices state that in the north drive
at the 1000 ft. level ore has been struck which assays over
3ozs. per ton. This accounts for the improved demand
for the shares. The discovery is regarded locally as of
considerable importance.

On the top of Manager Isles’ recent assurance
to shareholders in London, that reserves of South
Kalgurli (W.A.) totalled 81,000 tons of loz. ore, and that
there would be a monthly profit of £2,500, August figures
will come as a disagreeable surprise. The sudden slump
(just after Isles’ return) to 14dwt3., worth 555. a ton,
means a direct loss of ss. a ton, as working expenses total
60s. Mine is so patchy that no two successive days’
assays are alike, even from the same face, so that it is
simply marvellous that monthly results have been so
uniform hitherto. The decline of 700ozs. per month or
nearly 30 per cent, will be a nasty knock to holders. The
recent heavy slump in the scrip looks as if someone
anticipated the falling off. Electricity is to be substituted
for steam power, the Kalgoorlie Power Co. having con-
tracted to supply 288 h.p. This will reduce costs, but
mine is hopelessly over-weighted with capital and ex-
pensive treatment plant, and, with diminished returns
must break down under excessive strain.

The Oroya-Brown Hill (W.A.) combine is now
an accomplished fact, and their returns are being pub-
lished conjointly. During August the co. treated 4197
tons for 75050 z., bringing up the total output to 387,8170 z.
from 245,440 tons. These are big figures, but they look
like being equalled, if not eclipsed, in the future from the
Oroya rich chute. Even the Brown Hill appears to have
had a slice of luck since the amalgamation, as, in its
True Blue block, a body of ore has been struck 4ft. wide
and worth about loz. Locating of the rich chute at the
No. 8 level of the Oroya has not yet been effected.
» * * *
Ex-Mayor Tom Doyle, of Kanowna (W.A.),
still continues in luck. From the rich leader on his lease
he has broken out another lot of 10 tons for 2420 z.,
making the total 15700 z. from 42 tons. The value of the
gold approaches £6OOO, which is not a bad return for less
than one year’s toil.
» • • *
Queen Margaret, Bulong (W.A.), continues to
turn out the usual rich patches, which more than meet
all exs. The new acquisition, the South Gippsland, at
Vosperton, is being keenly prospected, the shaft being
now well on the way to 400 ft., where the reef will be
tested. Above the 200 ft. level, 2400 tons were treated by
the prospectors for 30000 z., and, should a similar grade
of ore be proved to continue to the 400 ft. level, a good
rise in scrip may be safely anticipated.
* * * *
The Great Oversight, Bulong (W.A.), which
has been looking rather sick for some time, has made a
sudden recovery. The Welcome syndicate announces
1470 z. as the result of treating 14 tons, and Grigo 8520 z.
from 48 tons. The total gold won now amounts to
12,7840 z. from 1470 tons. This is a truly marvellous
result, seeing that all the gold has been obtained within
50ft. of the surface on a quarter-mile stretch. That the
line is well named will be feelingly admitted by share-
holders in the old co., as Grigo is working from their
shaft sunk some eight or nine years ago, and which
actually passed through the rich stone without anyone
detecting it. Such is luck !
* * * *
Great Fingall (W.A.) August return reads
7470 tons for 12,0050 z., worth £29,434. This appears quite
right till analysed, when it is seen that, though ounces
are only 66 less than July, value is £1460 less. This is
accounted for by the bad extraction at mill and conse-
quent enormous increase in cyanide gold. The average
figures are: Mill, -July, 26’9dwt.; Aug., 24'7dwt. Cyanide,
July, s'Bdwt. ; Aug., 9‘sdwt. Gross value per ton is only
2s. Bd. less than in July. Value of a ton of ore for last
three months has been £5 65., £5 Bs. 6d., and £5 ss. lOd.
The lode has split up in the Bth level and become poorer,
but this has happened in every level. There seems to be
a screw loose somewhere, judging from the sagging of the
scrip.
• • » •
What is supposed to be the Fingall lode has
been located by a diamond drill bore in the Great Fingall
Southern Blocks at a depth of 1500 ft. The drill pierced a
large body of ore, and samples from the core are reported
to have given excellent results. “Billy” Palmer, the
manager, has a reputation in Queensland and Maoriland
for extreme caution and conscientiousness, and,
guarded as his official report is, it appears likely
that his company is on a good thing. If it be the
Fingall lode which he has discovered (and as
to that there seems to be little doubt), he has
upset the calculations of the Fingall crowd, Zeb. Lane
and others, who pegged out a couple of areas, large
enough for sheep stations, south and west of the Fingall
mine in the hope of securing the continuation of the reef.
But the Fingall lode is subject to the “ jumps.” General
strike in Fingall mine is north and south. Going south
it keeps faulting to the east. By overlooking this pecu-
liarity, Bewick, Moreing & Co. and others appear to have
acquired valueless areas. Palmer noted reef’s character-
istic in this respect, and in pegging his blocks took it into
consideration. The parent company may get some of the
underlie but will have to go to an enormous depth for it,
as the reef underlies only lin 60. Assuming that Palmer
has struck the right thing (and he thinks he has) the
abandoned Kinsella is almost certainly the southern
continuation of the big Fingall reef. Great Fingall
Southern Blocks is a resurrection of the Weld-
Hercules Co. It has a 20-head mill and complete
pumping and winding plant at Weldrange
waiting for something good to put it on. Co. is now
applying for three months’ exemption, on the ground
that time is required to make arrangements to sink a
shaft to cut the reef, and secure and erect the necessary
machinery. It is stated in the application that £lOO,OOO
will be spent in developing the leases and erecting plant.
But one drill core does not make a mine, and surely,
before starting a big shaft, co. will put down bores on
other sections of the leases 1
* * * *
Manager Lonsdale has deserted Westralia
Waihi, Davyhurst, for Lady Robinson, Burbanks. Latter
mine has been run by a private syndicate for a consider-
able time past, but has recently been floated into a co.
to facilitate dealings in scrip. Operations will in future
be conducted on a more ambitious scale. Lonsdale’s re-
tirement from Waihi looks rather ominous for that much-
boomed concern.
• * • *
The reports to the Commonwealth Parliament
on pearl-shelling give a pack of rare information about
that Australian industry of which Australians probably
know least. The annual take at Thursday Island is
worth anything from £lOO,OOO to £130,000 ; at Port Dar-
win, from £15,000 to £30,000; and about Broome (north-
west Australia), from £25,258 (1895) to £104,973 (1901).
At “Thirsty,” of the 255 divers 190 are Japs, 26 are
Filipinos, only 1 is European ; at Darwin there are 37
Japs in the total of 47 ; at Broome 6 are white, 230
colored. The crews are a more mixed lot, but the Japs
are still on top and the whites still at the bottom. Of
1773 at “Thirsty,” 42 are Europeans; of about 1000 at
Broome not one is white. The shell is worth up to £l3O
a ton ; but it runs up and down. Lately, glitter being
the fashion because of the Coronation, it has been up.
In the business, there are luggers and schooners,
the former up to 15 tons, though those from 10 to 12
are the most profitable in ' the Westralian trade ;
the latter anything up to a couple of hundred. The
lugger (the livelier the better) does the actual pearling ;
the schooner (around “Thirsty,” called “the station”)
carries the boss and the slop-chest, wherein much of the
boss’s profit lies. Every night in the West, and twice or
three times a week at the other pearling places, the
shell is collected and taken to the schooner and prepared
for market. The lugger carries six men—the diver, his
tender, and four of a crew. The diver is in charge. The
crew take it in turn, a pair at a time, to keep the air-
pump going. The diver draws £2 a month and from £2O
to £25 of the “ lay ”on the shell; an average “ lay ”is
now about 4i tons a year of about nine months. (These
are Westralian rates; those at “ Thirsty ” are over a
wider range.) All the rest of the “staff” are on wages—
and what they can steal.
To get a pearl out of the shell without the boss
knowing, you simply turn the shell on edge, coax in a
wedge, and probe round for the foreigner; and 9999
times in 10,000 you don’t find it, because it isn’t there.
The shell shuts up when the wedge comes out, and so do
you. On the Westralian coast, off “ Thirsty,” or any-
where else, there is little fishing in more than 20
fathoms ; deeper than that it gets risky, and the diver can
stay under only a few minutes. Still there are Manila-
men and Japs, who have worked down to 37 fathoms.
Most of them are dead now. Paralysis and rheumatism
helped them out, though the latter comes to shallow-
water men quite as much as to the others. Among the
Japs, it is reckoned “ flash ”to go deep. The yield of
pearl per ton of shell varies extraordinarily ; a lugger
whose haul one year was £4O got £3OO the next. A fair
average might be £l2O a boat. The value of the shell is,
of course, independent of this.
* * * •
A “little industry” along the far-north Aus-
tralian coast is tortoise-shell getting, though it is the
hawksbill turtle that gives the shell, and not the tortoise
at all. But the stuff does not come this way ; the trade
is almost all done by Malay proas, that come along about
December or January and stay till June, collecting
beche-de-mer and trepang. Some of the proas bring
blacks with them; some of them trade with the local
nigger. Bowen’s Straits are the headquarters.

“ Scotty the W.”: lie finding and losing reefs
'(B. 20/9/’O2). A man in a survey-party at Bywong, 25
years ago, brought in a black, mineralised stone, and the
cook dollied it for ldwt. (3s. 6d.) of gold. From that day
no one ever struck it. All that was known was that the
reef wag near a fallen “ stringy ” off which two sheets of
bark had been stripped. I spent a month looking for it.
The man himself spent a lot longer than that bus
couldn’t get the bearings again.

Latest advices from America respecting the
copper market show that the situation continues to be
somewhat difficult of explanation. The consumption in
America continues enormous; good authorities estimate
that it is on a scale never before known. Stocks are not
large, and producers are not generally pressing metal for
sale. Nevertheless prices do not respond. Production
will be curtailed somewhat by the closing down of the
United Verde mine, on account of an extension of the fire
which has been burning in the mine for some time. It is
uncertain how long the shut-down will last.
* • » *
The decline in the value of copper has seriously
affected the profit-earning power of the big American
mines. A comparative statement of the nett earnings of
the several copper cos. in the Butte district, controlled
by the Amalgamated Co., for the years ended June, 1901
and 1902, shows that, in the five mines, there was a
decrease in the latter year of $9,687,000, or 71 per cent.,
the figures being—l9ol, $13,512,000 ; 1902, $3,825,000.
Somebody recently declared that the
world’s record for sailing ships was 325 miles in a
day. This moves many old shellbacks to indigna-
tion, and a hasty groping among the leaves of
ancient history. A few of the alleged records:
Red Jacket, .in 1856) averaged 334 miles a day for
an eight-day run. The ship Melbourne, now the
Macquarie, covered, 5129 miles in 17 days, best
day’s run being 374 miles. The James Baines, of
the Black Ball line, in 1854, ran 420 miles in 24
hours, with main sky-sail set, though other
ships passed en voyage were under reefed
topsails. This is claimed as the record, but
a very violent Australian skipper declares that
the American ship Flying Cloud, in 1851, made
379 knots, equal to 433 miles, or 18 miles an hour,
for 24 consecutive hours. A comparatively recent
record (1892) is that credited to the old tea-clipper
Pak Wan of 619 miles in 41 hours. This was
between Honolulu and ’Frisco. Ship sailing
records, it is noted, mount higher the further they
go back into antiquity. Alas ! for a glory that
has faded.

Recent obscure par from Sydney D.T., as
illustrating the base uses to which the State
gubernatorial office is brought:—
The new band stand in Petersham Park will be officially
opened to-morrow afternoon at 3.15 by the State
Governor.
A suburban band stand ! At this rate we’ll soon
be sane enough to combine the offices of State
Governor and City Sanitary Inspector.
A GREETING.
RETURNED COHENTINGENTER : “ Please, sir, I've
lost me leg, an’ ”
JINGO GEEBUNG: “ Well, you ain’t Ukely to find
it here. ” (Rushes in and slams door.)
All through the famous Boot-trunk trial,
when one of the Dubberke girls was involved,
and the Sangal trial, when another of them was
sentenced to death, old man Dubberke and his
wife weekly attended Dandenong market and
hustled around selling their butter, eggs, poultry,
&c. The agricultural instinct —dull, silent, plod-
ding, muddy, and methodical—kept them going
in their usual round through all calamities.
* * * »
The luck of the Dubberke family, that
enabled Thekla Regina to escape when the other
boot-trunkers fell in, still stands by the family,
though it is getting somewhat strained through
too much use. Sister Selina was strongly recom-
mended to mercy by a jury of young men on the
ground of Tisler’s influence over her. Yet the
evidence placed the influence all the other way.
Tisler practically pleaded guilty, and only asked for
mercy on the ground that Selina had persistently
incited—even driven —him to murder. She, in
her statement, denied all previous knowledge, and
assured the jury her remarkable conduct was due
to a sort of mental paralysis that seized her from
the moment she saw Tisler; that thereafter she
was incapable of acting or even moving. Yet her
little daughter, Minnie, had sworn her mother
took a drink in to her father immediately on the
completion of the attack. (Tisler said the drink
was brought to him, but anyhow the woman had
sufficient command of her nerves to take in a glass
of water when it was called for.) Also, she made
no attempt to account for the incriminating letter
to Tisler, beseeching that sluggish person to
“Come, come; only come,” and saying that she
could put up with her life no longer. Take it all
round it seems a good thing for a woman to be
tried by a jury of young men —but it’s not at all a
good thing for a man.
* * * *
Tickets for admission to the Sangal-Tisler
murder trial fetched 2s. 6d. in the open market.
These were admission-orders secured gratis by
people with a certain amount of “pull” and
turned by them into cash. This sort of thing is
so common that the State might as well decide at
once to charge admission to murder trials and
other sensational doings. The State wants the
2s. 6d. just as badly as anybody else, and it has
the best right to it, inasmuch as it provides the
show—or a good part of it. It furnishes the
building ; the prisoner is caught by its large-
footed policeman, and tried in its commodious
and centrally-situated dock, before its commodious
,Tudge, and away in the far distance its rope is
being greased with its grease ready for the hang-
ing. If it isn’t entitled to the 2s. 6d., who is ?
* * * *
Mrs. Selina Sangal’s type-written tale,
which she read to the Court at the Dandenong
murder trial, reminded one of the yarn that a
certain ingenuous lawyer was credited with having
prepared for poor dear Willie Phillips, when that
youth was under arrest for the murder
of a North Melbourne book-keeper named
Brady. Mrs. Sangal’s last grand final con-
fession got no credence from anybody, although
she burst into tears several times whilst
reading it. Crown Prosecutor Finlayson has
more than the average lawyer’s share of
common humanity in pushing the case
against a prisoner, yet Finlayson didn’t scruple
to suggest that the woman’s incidental tears were
type-written, like the rest of her fiction. One of
these days, an innocent prisoner will get hanged
as the result of making a genuine explanation so
clear and satisfactory that it will inevitably be
credited to the defending counsel. The lawyer’s
practice will increase rapidly on the strength
of the “ingenious statement,” which he was
supposed to have invented for his client, while the
client himself is buried within Melbourne gaol—a
victim to the growing impression that touching
confessions, for use when there is nothing left save
to confess to the best advantage, are kept in stock.
The typed document, however, spoils the look of
the business. The standing up of the contrite and
bowled-out one with tears and a large printed
confession is too artificial to be impressive.
* * * *
As usual, Victoria’s waxed Chief Justice
reprimanded Selina Sangal and August Tisler at
some length before sentencing them to death.
When a judge proposes to tell the person in the
dock that he is going to be hanged anything else
he can say looks small, futile, and incongruous,
but judges, as a rule, fail to see the absurdity of the
position. They may see it some day when a
brilliant lawyer gets the sentence annulled on the
ground that the law only provides for hanging,
and that when the judge changed the penalty to
hanging and reprimand the whole proceeding
became illegal. So far, The Bulletin doesn’t
remember a single case in which the prisoner has
broken in on the long washy wash of his Honor’s
eloquence—as a rule the prisoner is too weary by
that time. But some day it is to be hoped the
about-to-be-hanged (a woman for preference) will
interrupt, the voluble bench that it is a
garrulous old female, and a platitude-machine, and
a stream of commonplace moral babble, and is a
great deal too fond of hearing its own voice. The
crestfallen judge couldn’t order the prisoner to be
hanged more than once, and if the occupant of the
dock was a woman he could hardly order her to
be fallen upon by the police and her mouth filled
with depositions to prevent her outraging his
sacred dignity.

A notable document found among the
papers of Apostle Worthington, now awaiting
trial, was the will which left him so much
wealth, and on which he is said to have raised the
wind considerably. The will left the bulk of the
alleged millions to the tall, pale, shifty mystic, but
incidentally the lady-testator also bequeathed 500
dollars apiece to “ my faithful coachman, William
Hartshorn ; my faithful, honest and good butler,
Henderson D. Crockham; and my dearly-beloved
cook, Mary Ann Coulter.” Is the dearly-beloved
cook a regular American institution ?

A few notes on
N.S.W. profes-
sional criminals, by
one who knows
them :
I found only three
educated men among
a thousand, the bal-
ance ign oran t. Crim-
inals are always hero-
worshippers. The re-
cord-breaker recently
discharged from Dar-
linghurst has “done”
40 out of his 84 years
in gaol. In his time
he has been a Metho-
dist lay preacher.
His speciality when a
tottering old grey-
beard was “pinch-
ing” carpenters’ tools
and “fencing” them
in the suburbs. He
has had many a pound
from Guy Boothby for
Lagl and reminis-
cences. The best-in-
formed N.S.W. crim-
inal was formerly a
Melbourne pressman
and chum of Smiler
Hales. Has a frank,
open face, and is a
picturesque liar. He
attempted suicide five
times during his last
term of eight years.
Another noted crook,
who has been charged
with almost every
crime in the calender,
pursues literature as
a hobby. Has done
17 years out of 35, and
his verses wouldn’t
disgrace Tub B. The
most heinous law-
breakers are heard
loudest at church-
services. Jack, one
of the Dora blacks, when in Maitland, was the best
worker in the prison. A “snob,” he was the first to
go to work and the last to knock off. When religious-
maniac Wyndham and horse-thief Ben Bridge were in
Darlinghurst, they were the best-conducted prisoners and
never heard to swear. Personally, Bridge was the greatest
take-down possible to meet—a meek, attenuated man
who didn’t seem capable of breaking through a fowlhouse.
A long-sentence nigger in Goulburn was ill and asked
the Governor to get him a ’possum. One was secured from
the scrub. The nigger ate it, and died the next day.
When Jimmy Governor came to Darlinghurst, he cheer-
fully remarked he expected 10 years. The King of N.S.W.
criminals has the face of,a pig. He has made money equal
to the income of a royal prince, his record being £15,000
for five minutes’ talking. A noted criminal went out
from Maitland, after seven years, was arrested the same
day for a fresh crime ; was committed, and, within three
weeks, came back for another seven years. This, by the
way, is quite common among “ the boys.”

following rewards in one issue :—£lso for informa-
tion about a fired woolshed at Wantabadgery, £75

“Proputty,” as usual, leads handsomely.

Mrs. W. Carah, at Allandale, Yic. (in Pea-
cock’s district), has just presented the census with
three children, all well and hearty. On three
previous occasions, Mr. Carah was blessed with
twins ; so he gets nine children in four separate
shocks.
* • * *
A most sporting people, the Austrians.
A big trial in Vienna has just revealed that a well-
known member of Society, finding his
’wife with a friend, stunned the latter
ith the butt of a revolver, tied him up,
cut off half his moustache, and in-
flicted “degrading tortures” on him.
Afterwhich he cut off all the lady’s
hair and turned them out of doors.
They brought an action against him for
assault, “imprisonment,” etc., but a
virtuous court let him off and gave
them two months each! A man who
would cut off his wife’s hair without
giving her a run for her money, so
to speak, would hit a sleeping pheasant
with the butt-end.

Melbourne realises more and
more that it is commercially Lost un-
less it digs a new Yarra. It dug a new
one years ago, according to expensive
advice tendered by that expensive
English engineer, John Coode, because
the old channel was too crooked for
large vessels to negotiate. Now vessels
have become so much longer that they
can’t negotiate the crooks of the new
channel, even though it is less crooked
than the old one, so the final alternative
appears to be digging an absolutely
Straight channel, and using the present
one (which isn’t paid for yet) as an eel-
farm.

DYSPEPTIC SPRING LYRIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HI, Spring 1 the time that puling poets purl about,
Gift from above !
In Spring the heart should turn, if there’s a girl about,
To thoughts of love.
But comes Spring cleaning, then begin to whirl about,
Your household gods,
Home is a chaos, chairs are things to hurl about,
Evens are odds.
Oh, what a burst of turbulent activity,
Whitewash and paint !
Splash, dash and crash, with smell that’s aught but civety
’Twould vex a saint.
Where is the cause for poetic festivity,
Rapture sublime ?
Let poets rave ! The plain man wouldn’t give a “ D ”
For such a time.
No doubt the Spring adds beauty to the scenery;
Now, as of old,
Branches are freshened with bright shoots of greenery,
And flecks of gold ;
But there’s too much of twixt and of betweenesy,
And rains and snows.
How many beans make five beans in your beanery ?
Lord only knows 1
Winter brought coughs that were all but incurable;
Summer’s too hot;
Sometimes in Autumn fine days are assurable,
Mostly they’re not.
When one compares, one could find Spring endurable,
But for the lies
Which poets tell. If I’d my way I’d lure a bull
To toss them to the skies.

“TO BE IN THE FASHION WE MUST

CHEERFUL IDIOT: “Going to hear Melba?”
THE GOTH: “I suppose I must.”
The recent S.A. earthquake is pretty con (
clusively proved to have started under the sea
somewhere about Kangaroo Island. The island
caught a sharp shock ; so did the southern end of
Yorke’s Peninsula ; so did Glenelg, on the Ade-
laide shore of the Gulf. In the city itself the
houses are almost all built of stone. They trem-
bled or shook, but seldom cracked. The second
shock, 24 hours later, was just a gentle waving
movement of the ground, but it completed the
panic of many people, and the doctors had a great
harvest of nerve cases. Two deaths were clearly
attributable to the shock. The telephone-girls,
on the occasion of the first shake-up, were just off
duty (8.5 p.m.), but pluckily went back and took
what risk there was in the big G.P.O. to attend
the calls that followed. Three hundred people
rang up almost immediately to find out if they
were dead, or if it was the Day of Judgment, or
something equally relevant.

The recent earthquake that rattled the
churches together in Adelaide was responsible for
at least one mirthful scene. The first jolt brought
a fat public personage, in a glittering high hat
and a new suit of expensive clothes, diving head-
long out of a big building. He clutched wildly at
thin air, then fled into the middle of the road,
and, kneeling among the dust, distractedly con-
fessed his sins, and urged the Lord not to drop
any more buildings on him than was absolutely
necessary. The shocks passed, but the stunned
and distracted sinner continued to cry for divine
aid until the unfeeling laughter of a crowd, and
the threat of a man with a vehicle to drive oyer
him, recalled him to a sense of comparative
security. Then he rose in his ruined clothes and
left.

Apropos of the gift of a bull eland to the
Adelaide Zoo by the Duke of Bedford, it is re-
membered that ex-Governor Fowell Buxton pro-
mised £250 towards paying for a stallion zebra,
but although that is years ago the vice-regai
cheque has never made its appearance. It would
be very welcome now, for the Govt, has cut down
the subsidy, and the struggle to buy cat’s meat for
the lion is very severe.

“ The roasting of several work-girls ”
(writesTHEßuLLETiN’sLondon correspondent) “in
broad daylight—4 o’clock on a summer afternoon-
before thousands of spectators in the finest street
(Queen Victoria) in London city, while the fire-
ladders were 10ft. too short for rescue purposes, is
a several weeks old story now. As a result a
splendid pneumatic combined-water-tower-and-
rescue ladder was exhibited this week. Carbonic
acid gas was pumped into the rescuer, and the
ladder, in 40 seconds from unbuckling the horses,
chocking wheels, etc., sprang telescopically to 80ft.
A fireman, carrying a hose, went up with it and
showed water at once. Later, holding a barrel—
to resemble a helpless, rescued person — the ladder
was ‘collapsed,” and both landed safely. Seems
a splendid invention, and is — of course —German.

Many cases of hardship are alleged through
the “proof of age” clauses in the N.S.W.
Old Age Pensions Act. _ Lots of pensions were
granted last year provisionally on the applicant
proving him or herself to be 65 within a certain
time. Many of the aged recipients profess to
have been quite unaware of this necessity, and
when now called upon for documentary evidence
as to age are not in a position to produce it. In
fact, they are no further forward than they were a
year ago. A vague feeling that the local member
would see that everything was right seems to have
been the prevailing sentiment.
There is one lock-oub on the Westralian
goldfields which, down to now, the Arbitration
Court has not wrestled with. It springs out of the
old, old row between the doctors and the sweating
lodges that wear colored frills and call themselves
brothers. The doctors stood the squeezing till the
Mayor of Coolgardie wanted the
medical benefits of a lodge; then
they sat down tight and decided
that in future no employer
should be treated as a lodge-
patient. The brothers with
the frills on, working-men
mostly, decided to reply to
this in the good old tyrant
boss’s way of importing “free
laborers”; and they got what
they wanted in Maoriland.
Whereupon the Goldfields
Sawbones Union issued this
manifesto: —
This being the state of affairs,
the Medical Union, learning its
lesson from other unions, has de-
termined to treat the imported
doctor as the other unions would
treat anyone imported to take
their places in case of a labor
dispute. Its members will have
nothing whatever to do with the
imported doctor. They will
neither meet him in consultation
nor give an anaesthetic for him,
and will have no professional com-
munication with him whatsoever,
nor in any way, nor at any time
render him any professional assist-
ance. They now make this state-
ment public, so that they shall
not be accused of callousness
should emergency arise requiring
their assistance.
But, down to latest, the
G.S.U. had not found it neces-
sary to go into camp and live on
damper and stag, with pumpkin for
dessert; so things for the strikers are
not as bad as they might be.
Dear Bulletin. — Be the barmaid question.
Ask any mother who has had the experience of a
barmaid if she would like to see her daughter
behind the bar.—An ex-Barmaid Mother. [Also,
ask any intelligent and well-educated woman who
has had experience as a servant, waitress, shop-
girl, factory-girl, chambermaid in a coffee-palace,
etc., if she would like to see her daughter follow-
ing any of these occupations. Even supposing
that the alleged ex-barmaid above mentioned is
an ex-barmaid, which isn’t proved ; and that she
has a daughter, which she doesn’t say ; and that
she wouldn’t like to see that daughter behind a
bar, which she doesn’t say, either; and that her
experience, if she had any, lay in a respectable
bar, so that she got a fair all-round view of the
trade—the above doesn’t prove much.— Ed. B.]

Writes a correspondent:—
Dined yesterday at a sixpenny restaurant. A crowd of,
wharf-lumpers and country yahoos staying at the place, 1 ,
two blaokfellows and a blind man at table. An unfortunate •
wretch of a girl waited at table, heavy-eyed and heavy-
footed from want of sleep and overwork. Leaning over a
yahoo to hand me a cup of tea, he pinched her, which she
resented. Another caught her skirts when passing, while
nearly every paltry “sixpenny grubber” indulged in
idiotic familiarities, and yelled her Christian name with
“dear” affixed from the end of the room whenever he
wanted his “ hot water” replenished. One 16-stone hog,
while paying his sixpence in front of me, was informing
the boss, a greasy onion-smelling capitalist-in-a-small-
wa.v, that “ there’s too much side about her. She’s a
collar-and-cuffs tart, she is. Threatened to throw the tea
over me for speaking a word to her.” I informed the
greasy one that, considering the kind of word he spoke
to her, it was a pity she had not thrown boiling oil over
him, but he assured me that it was not “ business ” for a
girl to take offence at small familiarities. It is a pity the
barmaid abolitionists do not dine at sixpenny houses, but
being a tea-and-scone crowd their eyes are shut to the life
of the unfortunate restaurant slave who, draggled, worn
and insulted, has fifty times more temptation to go to the
devil than the ordinary barmaid.

After being rent for many months by a
struggle of Old and Medium Cafes, Melbourne
Women’s Hospital has at last come to a sensible
compromise on the Bed Card question. Formerly
the card hung above the bed set forth that the
occupant was “Mrs. Jones” or else “Emma Jane
Smith”—the former being “respectable” while
the latter was a daughter of sin. The old Com-
mittee felt that it couldn’t tell a lie and imperil
its immortal soul by calling Emma Jane Smith
“Mrs.” when she wasn’t “Mrs.” On the other
hand, the other lady objected to being described
simply as “Maria Jones,” so that way of levelling
things was impossible. And meanwhile the old
arrangement led to all sorts of for moral
cats insisted on speaking severely to Emma J ane
Smith about her fall before she was strong enough
to rise, and that helped to damage the hos-
pital’s record as a curative institution. Now the
simple device has been arrived at of having no
bed-card with the patient’s name on it. Pro-
vided the unmarried lady has a four-and-sixpenny
wedding-ring, and a coherent yarn to tell to the
married lady in the next bed, her secret will
henceforth be her own. If she is content to say
that her husband is prospecting in Westralia, all
will be well ; if she wrecks the show by saying he
is an aide-de-camp, or a large squatter, or a ship-
owner, or a duke, it is her own fault.

T. * Kennedy Macdonald, of Wellington
(M.L.) who used to be described by admiring lady-
writers as “that great and good man,” is raising
his rich baritone in denunciation of the model of
the proposed statue to her late Majesty, which it
is proposed to erect in Wellington. The thing is
generally described as a burlesque, and without
symmetry or likeness. “The profile is incorrect,
the nose being turned skyward, instead of—as it
should have been—possessing a downward tend-
ency. . . . The hands are masculine, instead of
being the soft, chubby hands of our late Queen.”
This is mistaken friendliness of T.K.M.’s part.
Dignity, not chubbiness, is understood to be the
strong point of sovereigns. A chubby dynasty is
an outrage on the monarchial
The contempt of the Chinaman for the
white man’s unreasoning prejudices i 3 superb.
All through Maoriland, official Chows are busy
resurrecting the bodies of their dead brothers for
export to Chow-Asia. This news trickled to a
city journal, which stirred the Health Dept, to
seize its axe and interfere. But the Health Dept,
merely said in a tired voice that a Chow, after
being buried for six months or so, was not a
Chow to be lightly interfered with, and forgot all
about it. Meanwhile the resurrectionists from
the Flowery Land have been digging up the late
lamented Ah and Kum with stolid indifference.
They hired grain sheds and empty meat depots in
the seaports, and stored the deceased comrades in
neatly-arranged piles. There are 100 of them
stored at Greymouth alone, and Greymouth
has been objecting in vain. The Chinese
doctor who directs operations states that for
each body exhumed the officials receive £9,
and for each skeleton only £5, which means
that the body-snatchers have £4 worth of
good reason for picking their Chow while he is
still comparatively young. And they have been
picking him young. One or two Chinamen who
died while the operations were going on were just
put on the heap without being buried at all.

In a few weeks’ time designs and models
for a statue of the late Queen, to be erected in
Melbourne at a cost of between £BOOO and £lO,OOO,
will arrive in that city, and the committee in
charge of the business has only £GO2O in hand.
As the committee has not met for months —there
being nothing to meet about —there seems to be
no prospect of the balance being raised.

A quaint story of ropingin a harmless-
husband was told to a Melbourne Bench lately.
The applicant swore that, on 10th March, ’95, he
was to be best man to his then mate, and that
before the proceedings the pair got distinctly
drunk. After his mate had been turned off, at a
private house in Fitzro.y, that gentleman turned
to him and said, “ It’s your turn now. Go ahead ;
I’ll pay the fee.” He was thereupon married to
the bridesmaid, whom he had never seen before,
and about whom he knew nothing whatever.
Next morning he awoke with a wife and a splitting
headache. He was a loving husband to the lady,
he said ; also, a father to her children, in spite of
the fact that other men kept calling round and
inquiring after the children—until the lady
transferred her mature affections to the gentleman
with whom she was now living. He put it to the
Bench that that gentleman —if any —ought to
maintain her, and the Bench cordially agreed.
No evidence was brought to show why the appli-
cant’s drinky friend, away back in 1895, thus rushed
a drinky mate into marriage. Possibly it was only
a peculiar variety of humor.
WHY THEY PARTED.
SHE (elderly but rick): " Will you love me,
George, when I’m old ?”
GEORGE (impetuously): “Darling! I love you
off” (but she had fainted before he could
add, “and shall for ever.”)
Rev. J. Burgess finds much sympathy in
Vic. Presbyterian Assembly for his motion calling
upon the Federal Parliament, in its dealings with
the divorce laws, to give only the innocent party
to a divorce the right to re-marry. The guilty
party, not being allowed to re-marry, will, of
course, just “ live in a state of sin.” The fact that
he is the guilty party shows that he is quite
capable of living in a state of sin, and knows all
about it. And the Presbyscotch Church proposes
to make dead sure that he will continue to live in
that state by leaving him no other state to live in.
It proposes to cut off his ehance of reformation —
or ner chance, as the case may be. The Presby-
scoteh Church grows a fine crop of unforgiving
bigots at times, and, as an incentive to immorality
and a direct cause of sin, it has a lot of points
about it.

On Peace Day in an Australian capital
a pathetically jingoistic tradesman stuck up the
portraits of King Edward, Barton, and Seddon
under the legend, “Saviours of the Empire.”
He was advised by some “ persons in authority ”
that the combination would not be considered in
good taste in England, as Royalty had no rival ,
and always saved the Empire single-handed. Iha
objectionable photos, of Barton and Seddon were
promptly removed, and the Kmg s P,, • »

Empire is so rotten that it requires to be saved,

Empire. m •
Talk about the child-wives of India! A
girl under 14 years of age was recently married
with great ceremony at a village in the far north
of Maoriland, the function being perpetrated by
a bona-fide parson in the local church. I here
were six bridesmaids in attendance, and from all
the surrounding districts people flocked to see the
circus. „
Dr. Cherry, of Melb. University, who has
been investigating the Adelaide and Broken Hill
water supplies, rather astonishes the Broken Mill
people by reporting favorably on the local drink
and wash. True, he got over 1000 bacteria m 100
drops of it, or 10 beasts to each drop, and
the unscientific person wonders how many more
could be crowded in before it became necessary to
eat it with a fork ; but he adds the assurance that
they are a good fattening brand of bacteria, some-
thing like small cows, and not so disastrous as they
look. The only place where he found the par-
ticular brand of water-serpent (the colon bacillus)
which makes the bacteriologist feel really
alarmed was the local service tanks, which
are perched on a hill above the town, and
get their share of the back-yard. rubbish-
heaps when they blow around. The purity of the
water in the storage reservoir he explains by sup-
posing that the most dangerous bacilli perish of
heat and dust on the banks, while waiting two or
three years for a shower to wash them in. Of
three water-supplies—Melbourne, Adelaide and
Broken Hill—Dr. Cherry seems to think Adelaide
the best to give to an elderly relative from whom
you have expectations.

Sometimes his Honor conceals a certain
measure of human sympathy under his horse-hair
exterior. At Melbourne, recently, a juror re-
fused duty because he had just got a job, after
three months’ idleness, and would lose it again if
he failed to put in a,n appearance. His Honor
looked darkly upon him, as if half inclined to give
him three months, and then fined him a penny.-
Also, his Honor paid the copper himself.
At Edward Yll’s coronation, it is alleged,
the great majority of the coronets were too large
and rested on the ears of the peerage, making the
peerage’s ears stick out like wings. The nobility
of long descent is apt to be small in the head,
with a dome of thought that rises to a peak in the
middle, and the adventurous fly which struggles
up it, alpenstock in hand, finds little foothold.
“J.F.D.”: Met two Cohentingenters on
the Northern-roai. They told me they were
walking to Brisbane. They had spent their few
shillings in Sydney and repeated requests for a
passage availed nothing, so they put up “Matilda”
and started in full uniform. I attempted to cheer
them by remarking that some Jingo boss would
engage them before they got far, but a string of
swear words from one drowned the other’s reply.
When the first man had stopped swearing and the
other, and quieter, man could be heard I asked
b : "i what he had said. He replied he had said
“Damn.”
VOICES OF THE SEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A smiling sky, and an open boat,
And love, suffice for me ;
Only to lie, and to idly float
On the sensuous sea ;
Kissed by a wind that is sweet and clear,
Splashed by the pearls of spray ;
Heedless of all that hath ever been,
Heedless—for one brief day.
Sporting with fancies the sunbeams fling
Out of the wavelet’s crest;
Learning the song that the mermaids sing,
Gay as a wanton’s jest;
Clouds may arise, but they melt and go ;
The playful porpoise leap ;
Love speaks aloud in the azure glow
Of sky, and ocean deep.
Out on the cliffs when the winter blast
Lashes to rage the sea ;
Far out a ship with a broken mast—
All seemeth vanity ;
Waves of memory uprise, and break
Over a sullen shore ;
Cries that are born of a worn heart’s ache,
Mock in the angry roar.
Death that is dark as the darkest night
Draws nigh ; my days wax few ;
Life lies behind in the waning light—
How much I fain would do 1
We idly laugh who had better weep ;
Blindly our way we tread
Till, spent, we stand by the unknown deep*
When Love and Hope have fled.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, September 30, 1902.
My Dear Arini,—
A very fine body of men, with Lister Lister in
command, stood at ease (against the supper-table)
at the Art Society’s rooms, last week, when the
committee of the amalgamated societies received
its guests at the first conversazione of this year’s
hanging. There were so many receivers that the
majority of guests took them to be a section of the
received, who had come early to secure a good
vantage spot for staring. What is known as
Societee-e (Australian pronunciation) does not
affect to take its pleasure on artists’ premises.
Lut about 500 very respectable-looking, and,
in some instances, most remarkable-looking
persons honored the festival. Someone resusci-
tated a middle-aged joke. Pointing to a drought-
horror in the water-color section, he said, “ Why
did they hang that picture ? ” Then she answered
the : “Because they couldn’t catch
the artist. There was some music, some conjur-
mg, and some lightning sketching.
Sid. Long tapped an original idea, and realised
it charmingly, in his “ Flamingoes, or Birds of a
h eather. The rose-pink flock—there must be 22
of the serpent-necked birds—have paced down
out of the green dusk of the bush into the dusk of
green-shaded water, and turned the stream to
rippled ruby. They stand as in self-communion,
or plume themselves abstractedly. Two in the
background seem to threaten one another. Others
in the foreground appear to contemplate the two
slender, naked, red-headed girls. One of the girls
leans on the green bank, and a shaft of sunlight
strikes fire from her hair and streaks with
dazzling white one angular shoulder. Other
damsel sits in the water and shows a long back.
But the way those grave, old, softly-scarlet birds
look at the damsels—something out of a recent
story of Harland’s comes to me. Someone is
speaking to a tired, cynical young man: “ The
only thing that will wake you up and put a little
life and human nature into you is a love affair
with a red-haired woman. Red in the hair means
fire in the heart. It means all sorts of things.”
Norman Lindsay’s “Before the Malady of the
Soul might have been “ Drink,” or “ Before the
Straight-fronted Corset.” Tawny hussies with
uncurbed figures, let alone uncovered ones, disport
themselves on foot, or on leopards and donkeys,
whilst men, not strictly sober, carry wine-jars and
romp with the hussies. A red-nosed Pan plays on
the pipes, and there are poppies in the fore-
ground. Norman might bring the picture up to
date: make it a “push” disporting at Parsley
Joay ;no need to alter the name. The person with
the hind-quarters of a goat could have the fore-
quarters added, and so be fitly in the picture—a
william goat.
Mrs. Olga Morgan shows exquisite miniatures
on ivory. The child faces are especially note-
W i : . some l°°k as if they might have silver or
gilded wings behind their cherub heads. There is
a tiny thing by Arthur Williams among the water
colors—a study in nebulosity it might be called ;
although there is a misty outline of a shed and of
a woman and child a dream-scape in the
tenderest, coldest color-harmonies, violets, greys
and greens. It has the charm of mystery and
tar-ottness, and enough “temperament” to make
you realise “ the terror born of twilight-tide.” I
brought one of the young artists in front of this
panel and hazarded a remark upon “the beauty
of its coldness. ” How snortful he was, to be sure '
As if there could be any beauty in coldness. How
these young artists do yearn over rose-red days
and poppied hours and nocturmenne-haunted
nights. I his one quoted something about “ridi-
culous journalism monopolising the seat of judg-
ment when it should be apologising from the
dock.”
The robust secretary of the Art Societies is com-
plaining of indigestion because of the tea and
cakes which surround him every afternoon. Tea
seems indispensable to the success of a picture
show. Last week the President’s wife, Mrs.
Lister Lister, entertained friends. Mrs, A. J.
Fischer also made an excellent hostess on a later
day and provided some good music.
Mr. Norman Gough’s curtain-raiser, “The
I hreshold, ” which started Sydney Uni’s Jubilee
whirl on Monday, is a pretty little French picture
out of 1745, painted to show what a serious thing
it was in those days to be 40 years of age. A
forty-year-old vicomte (Mr. Gough) is married to
a lovely young wife (Miss Frances Rutledge).
JLhere are portraits of his ancestors hung about
her boudoir, and she apostrophises them angrily
as “also forty,” and shrieks aloud for life
and love and something under thirty and
the caviare-pots of Paris. Her lover (Mr.
W. J. Creagh), a marquis with a red head and
scarlet legs, and aged 25 years, comes to provide
“ er with all she craves—but the husband is
there. Forty and Twenty-five fight with pistols
out of sight of the audience, and the wife, tense
with horror, awaits the result of the duel. Simul-
taneous pistol shots are heard. Climax is good
Everyone expected the lover torush in and clasp his
lady to his art-needle-work vest. Instead, the
husband bows at the door. The author looked
and acted his part capitally. Miss Rutledge, in
a pale-green and apricot gown, looked well worth
fighting for. Marquis Creagh’s bullet-wound did
not, unfortunately, prove fatal, for he wa3 with
the group before the curtain. Their State Exes,
and Miss Rawson, and several nice, clean-looking
young men of their staff, sat in the seats of the
mighty.
Amongst die presents to. Captain Watt’s bride I
noticed that of a white silk petticoat. Now I
wonder if this, is the beginning of a new departure
m present-making among the upper classes. Youi
know, in Push society, the bridegroom, Ginger,
frequently makes a present of a corset to his
donah bride. Item: The bride wore no gloves—
so she must have very pretty hands. Item:
1 here were silver cigarette-cases amongst her
presents. Lord Beauchamp’s bride also received
silver cigarette cases amongst her presents.
Charity Fair in aid of the Kincumber and
Gladstone Home Orphanages really panned out
lOoz. to the ton. About £l6OO was realised. Yet
for the fortnight the secretaries were entrenched
rm le r -T° wn Hall they were paying £25 a night.
I hose hon. secs, deserve to swing on a well-oiled
golden gate, and the people who could grind the
faces of the orphans for £25 per night deserve to
swing elsewhere.
Friends of Mr. Max Rown, of Messrs. Swift
and Co., Spring-st., Sydney, will be glad to hear
that that gentleman is now on a fair way to re-
covery at Nurse Duffy’s private hospital, Macleay-
st., where he had a serious operation performed
about 10 days ago.
“From information received,” Cuyler Hastings,
the American jurist turned actor, who is playing
the name-part in “Sherlock Holmes,” in Mel-
bourne, will have to surround himself with a
barbed wire fence, or a couple of field pieces, to
keep the girls off, After his first appearance came
sporadic signs of the Hastings cult—posies, and
the naming of Persian cats after him, and such.
I get a letter now from a Victorian spring pullet
saying that she is about to ask the Acting-Federal
Premier to interview the American Consul-
General with the object of getting him to negotiate
a kiss for her from the big-eyed, olive-faced
Sherlock. Her intentions are strictly artistic (she
writes), and as a guarantee of good faith and
purely artistic admiration, she would make “the
greeting ” (greeting is certainly a very good word)
a matter of international arrangement as to where,
when, and duration. The vision of Messrs. Deakin
and Bray negotiating “a greeting” whilst the
principals wait in an anteroom is one fitted to make
the American Eagle laugh. I hear, by the way,
that Mr. Hastings (who, his fellow-travellers say,
is a modest man, and will talk of anything but
himself and acting) is a Canadian barrister, not an
American man of law, so there may be no necessity
for Mr. Bray to imperil the American Consti-
tution.
<< -r^ 8 a P olo B7 appears in a German newspaper:
I hereby retract the libel uttered by me against
Frau Meyer, to the effect that she was wearing
the same bonnet this year as she was last year. I
offer her my apologies.—(Signed) Frau Henning.”
Nurse Houston, of Clermont, the only Aus-
tralian nurse at the front in the S’African war, and
decorated personally by tho King, arrived at
Brisbane unwelcomed, unhonored and unsung.
In the Melba furore she was practically lost,
buried and trodden under foot.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Here is one refreshing incident from the dust
and heat of Melbourne’s reception of its returned
singer. The crowd was packed very tightly at
the top of Collins-street, opposite the Spencer-
street station, and waiting with the calmness of a
crowd that had eternity before it. A couple of
ladies, highly superior in frills and feathers,
claimed public attention with their loud conversa-
tion and the fuss of women who have good teeth
and plentiful jewellery. ‘Dear, dear me, how
quite too foolish of us to come here ! ’ said one in
a tone of mild self-reproach. ‘ Oh, it is, is it not ? ’
replied the other. ‘ When we have tickets for the
concert, too, and may see her in comfort.’ 1 Yes,
indeed, and we shall see her on the lawn
at Flemington. Really it is most ridicul-
ous. ‘ I can’t understand why I came. She
cannot be altered much either. You know
I saw her in Vienna, and afterwards at Berlin,
not so very long ago.’ ‘And I saw her several
times in dear old London at Coronation time.
And here we are standing in the dust and heat
just to see her pass. One does such ridiculous
things.| ‘Yes, indeed, one does.’ And just at
this point a hoarse voice from behind them arose,
in strident accents, and said: ‘Gerrout—whatyer
givin’ us ? Berlin be blowed! Londing be
blowed ! Why, to me own bloomin’ knowledge
you ain’t been away from that pub. o’ yours in
Richmond this seven years ! 9 It may have been
true, or it may not, but it had its effect, and two
shrunken females stole away.
“The unfairness with which Age does his cruel
work was something to muse over at that great
kow-tow to Melba of her contemporaries at the
Presbyterian College. Waiting for their guest,
the ‘old girls 9 fraternised. There wasn’t more
than a year or two’s difference between any two
■of them, but Time had been most capricious in his
markings. There were fat and jolly matrons, lean
and furrowed spinsters, and a few advanced
fashion plates, straight-corseted, bright-hued, un-
wrinkled and ungreyed. It was an interesting
assortment of the feminine Forties—that age
which drew from a wit of the period the lines:
Just in the noon of life—those golden days
When the mind ripens ere the form decays.
The individual whom this sentiment, best fitted
was Mrs. Oliver (of the wealthy Squatter Robertson
clan) who was—although in black—the prettiest
dame in the gathering.
Melba was late—naturally. Brown in garb,
brown in eye, brown in thatch, she at length ap-
peared, and her glowing, exuberant smiles kindled
the gathering. Secretary Fraser proffered a posy
(the gift of Mrs. Dives McEacharn). An address,
long and gushful, was read. Melba hung her
head, plucked nervously at her flowers, and,
looking up, showed her brown eyes aflood. She
could only murmur a sentence about ‘ the happiest
day in my life.’ She seemingly was on the point
■of an emotional break, when the thin, sharp, busi-
ness voice of Dr. McLaren descended on the
gathering, and Melba’s eyes cleared, and the
great psychological moment was lost.
Melba was full of fun. Each member of the
committee was presented to her by the secretary,
Miss I raser, who announced their married names
(nearly all are married). The owners followed
with their maiden names; they were at once
recognised and heartily greeted. ‘ Good Heavens I
Are you all married ? ’ exclaimed the diva, with a
pretty gesture of horror. ‘ Hullo ! Ada. You’re
not. Good enough ! . . . . Great Scot! Am I
to go up on the platform ? And with all those
?T? r^? ien ' -^ ever did such a thing in my life.
Well, here goes. Lead on ! ’
“ ‘ I’m so nervous of parsons,’ Melba whispers
to an old chum. ‘ Never sure that they’re not
going to spring a prayer on me. Think they will ?
For Heaven’s sake, give me a pinch if you see one
coming. ... A nice soft pinch, mind! . . .
Hullo ! Bess ; how jolly to see you all again ! . . .

no money on earth would ever make you part with

ber how I used to splash ink on his trousers when
he scolded me!

“And, brimming over with life and fun, she
passes out between the double file of white-frocked
school-girls, scattering amongst them smiles and
jokes.
Melba’s cue was to live up to her old Tomboy
reputation. She declared to her excited form-
fellows that she would crack the camera with her
smile, and if that availed not, she would wink at
its engineer. With quips and cranks Melba en-
livened the afternoon, and had even the kirk
pilots won over in the end.
“Some thought Melba’s gowning disappoint-
ingly quiet, but the tiny tucks and quillings of her
brown silk voile were all sewn by hand —a circum-
stance which, ‘on its own,’ stamps a garment as
, superior.’ Tiny brown cords and tassels figured
in the trimming, while good lace, stretched plainly
over pale-green, brightened lower sleeves and
bodice. In cut, the gown conformed to tight-
waisted Parisian ideals, not to blousy Russian
style. Observers wondered audibly how the
owner of so small a waist could shine as a
singer, forgetting that the Parisian modiste
doesn t really pinch in her subject’s middle,
but adds to her apparent measurements above
and below, so that the belt area looks small by
comparison. Melba’s hat, a flattish confection of
brown tulle and artificial leaves in shades from
green to brown, was voted ‘crushed’and ‘dowdy’
by all but experts. Even the most unsophisti-
cated she present must, however, have been im-
pressed by Melba’s chain of splendid pearls, not
matching in size or shape, but just as they came
out of the shell, except for the polishing process.
“Melba wears her dark, curly, roughish hair
dressed in simple fashion, rather low down. Her
healthy brownish hands, so plump that the top-
button of her white gloves is apt to be left un-
fastened, are not manicured to waxlike pallor.
Altogether, in looks and manner, the ‘ star ’ seems
downright and direct, though her complexion,
under a fine brown veil, shows the faint heliotrope
tinge of face-powder.
“ Melba’s first sing-song, in her native city, was
a triumph. The audience was worked up to fever
point before the Star’s turn came, but when she
glided into view their anticipation passed into rap-
ture. The Idol (whether her voice would eventu-
ally prove up to expectation or not), seemed very
beautiful, in that first moment of greeting Mel-
bourne, from her throne of song. The lines and
curves of the figure appeared perfect, revealed, as
they were, by a clinging robe (simple but exquisite)
of creamy cobweb, glistening with dewdrops of
palest gold and wreathed with faint-hued roses,
fashioned of blended silk, lisse and velvet. No dia-
monds, no tiara, not even a flower in the dark
hair, theonly ornament a rope of magnificent pearls.
Think of the song of some wild bird, perfectly
sweet, flawlessly true, thrilling and piercing with
vibrating power, utterly effortless, plaintive
sometimes, never throbbing and sobbing with
pain or passion—that’s how she sounded !
“A bunch of violets, thrown to Melba by her
pretty little niece, was fervently kissed and waved
above her brown head by the diva. Again and
again she put her hand to her side—the heart
side—as a suggestion of emotional flood-gates,
and once the hand was flung up to the eyes as if
to meet the tears there.
_ “As for the Melba company, the little Italian
girl-harpist looks as soft, clumsy, and innocent as
a fleecy black puppy, and plays like what she is, a
brilliant child. Bensaude, with his black, up-
turned moustache, will be a favorite. Arens, as
of old, sings with great musicianly culture and
deep feeling, but lacks fine quality of voice.
“’Tis said that the Prince of Wales cabled to
Gov. Tennyson to make things nice for Melba.
People deny this, but it is perfectly true that
Aide Nevill was sent to ask the diva’s sister before
the Great One’s arrival what his Excellency could
do to please Madame? Sister said she didn’t
know, so the ambassador, just to begin with,
arranged a ‘ little dinner at Government House,’
and then went forth to book seats for the Vice-
Regal clan at the first concert. Women wonder if
Melba has brought her famous pink pearls to
Australia. Her collection of pearls of all varieties
is counted unique.
“The only person presented to Melba at the
matinee of ‘ Sweet Nell ’ (played particularly for
the sake of the other Nell) was Rupert Clarke,
who stood through the first act among the crowd
■at the back of the circle, but was trotted into the
box by the immaculately-garbed G. Musgrove and
introduced to the songster at the interval.
Rupert wore his most rakish air, his straw-hat
tipped to one side—his manner all bashfulness.
He slid out of the box after the briefest tete-a-tete
with the embowered glory of the hour. Melba
was allowed plenty of breathing room in a
capacious costume of fawn silk, lined canvas, and
big, flat toque inclining a little to one side. The
large white tulle bow that she invariably wears
formed a trying chin-niche.
“Louis Arens—somewhat fatter than when
we saw him last, viewed the matinee from a
perch at the rear of the circle. Here he
talked, in improved English, to the young Stewart,
who looked elfish and sharp-eyed in black. When
Louis played with her curls, she looked discon-
certed. *Ah ! ’ sighed the melodious tenor, ‘ she
has grown up since I have gone away. She was
my sweetheart; I lofed her. Now she is at the
shy age.’
“ Melba is now suffering from the reminiscent
brigade. One man is going about relating how,
at a concert at Lilydale, Nellie Mitchell had
strummed the local hall’s piano for some per-
formers, and when she lost the place and turned
two pages instead of one, and the dancers were
all toeing to wrong time, she flung her hands flat on
the piano, and muttered one big final blank word.
An elderly spinster shows a birthday book—
given her by her “ fond friend, Nellie.” And this
is an alarming register of ages—the school girls
having proudly penned there the year they were
born in. Another relic saver has a holy and pious
text, yellow with age, but wearing the good little
presentation words of good little Nellie. It must
nave been years ago.
“Melba was born on May 19th, 1861. Rich
mond witnessed the diva’s coming to light.
“ The ‘ Melba’ medallion brooch ‘published ’ in
two sizes by J. J. Miller, the theatrical printer, is
quite the best thing of its kind that has been
turned out by any Australian firm. The opaline
centre shows a delicately-tinted vignette portrait
of the prima-donna against a dark-green back-
ground, and the neat gilded setting is, for all the
necessary intents and purposes of fleeting fashion,
18-carat metal.
“ No chiffon parade in the memory of the oldest
female inhabitant ever approached the sumptuous-
ness of the Watt-Williams marriage at St. John’s,
Toorak, last Saturday. Twenty Solomons in all
their glory were never arrayed as the bride
and her retinue of rainbow-colored maids.
The saucy and lovely Miss Muriel Williams
shone resplendent in the sheeniest of duchess
satins (inches thick in texture). The train ? A
league long, trimmed with the loveliest of
Limerick laces. The head-dress, less exaggerated
than usual, and with a white rose or two fore and
aft the crown coils, from which a Limerick veil
ever so lightly fell. The chirpy Mr. Oswald Watt
conducted his part of the proceedings with perfect
sang-froid. He was assisted by a best and second
best man.
“The bridesmaids were a theatrical-looking
bunch of beauties, Miss Millicent Fairbairn pro-
minent among them. She wore cowslip yellow silk,
outflowing skirts, pellerined shoulders, and a gar-
landed head. Miss Lesly Madden and two others
sported heliotrope with the same theatrical
etceteras. Three plump girleens with wild sea-
blown tresses repeated the heliotrope and prim-
rose tones. Two train-carriers wore white.
Strikingly garbed, even amongst that swagger
troop, was Lady Williams (step-mamma of the
bride), in a most youthful gown of ivory voile,
with ridges of real lace of twine shade.
‘‘Melba was represented at the ceremony by
Miss Donaldson, who was got up Frenchily in a
light neutral voile and a fetching toque, from the
back brim of which wonderful white berries fell
in clusters. It was something new in millinery.
“Oom Bill Lyne tells with what heart-
felt relief he will welcome Bigjohn Forrest’s return
to these parts. The Defence Department has
proved a nest of hornets, Bill being much out of
sympathy with the aggressive Imperialism of
Maj.-Gen. Hutton. Mr. Forrest boasts, they
say, a bigger bow-window front than ever since
the Great Smoke orgies, but he comes back with
much of his strong-man reputation gone.
“The name of ‘Stonington’ is dropping into
disuse since the Clarkes had ‘ State Government
House ’ inscribed on their private pasteboards.
The gentle dove of the Y.R. establishment, who
boasts the name of Violet, for her own special
little tea and talk parties adorns the table with
her name-flower, and is stormed by her admiring
friends, all these months, with baskets, bouquets,
and showers of the fragrant blossom. She is as
romantic as any Amelia Sedley, has no smart
mannerisms, and no haughtiness.
“ The mutual devotion of the Sandows continues
to be a matter of talk. At the Woodlands Race
Meeting, t’other day, the Sandows ‘ deared ’ and
* darlinged ’ one another till the coo ing seemed
quite natural. ‘Canyousee, darling?’ Eugene would
call out. ‘Yes, darling.’ And the smart women on
the scene gaped as if they were hearing something
strange. Mrs. Sandow carried her fine figure with
easy grace and was not ashamed to draw up her
flaming red skirts above her substantial feet.

Nowra Storekeeper cured ; “My blood was thin and watery. My liver would not work properly, and I lost my
appetite. The nasty, mawkish taste In my mouth made all food distasteful. After meals I would have an attack of
dizziness, wind, internal pains, oppression on the chest, and pains right through my back and head and over my eyes. I
was weak and nervous, and unfit for anything. Doctors' treatment did not cure me, so I began taking Dr. Williams’ Pink

J. H. Angas, son of the founder of South

His father lived to be over 90.
Ezekiel Alexander Baker is a petitioner
for a patent for a covering of the air tubes of
pneumatic tyres. Baker is 79 years of age now,
but he still steps out lightly in pursuit of the main

Sydney University jubilations make it
worth observing that the Governor of N.S.W. is
not a University graduate, the Premier is not, and
the Acting Chief-Justice is not. Indeed, leading
positions in N.S.W. politics and law are rather
quotable against some current University pre-
tensions.
Dr. Clarke, the new C.E. Bishop of
Melbourne, brings English credentials as to his

little, for every bishop sent out from London carries

crow—Moorhouse.

Lady Tennyson comes from a seafaring
crowd, like the Rawsons. She is a Boyle, of
County Cork, of the old Courtenay-Boyle group,
that suggested some of Charles Lever’s most
Uproarious merriments. Her brothers (she had
six) have stamped about the world generally,
leaving a big Cork footmark in most places.
Mr. Lucas Tooth, of N.S.W. beer fame,
has, within the past two years, given £20,000 in
two lump sums to fashionable London subscription
lists. He continues to contribute nothing in the
shape of a special absentee tax to the beastly
country which is not good enough for him to live
in, but is good enough to drink him into affluence.
The Hon. Thomas Reibey, formerly an
Archdeacon of the Church of England, a member
of the Tasmanian Legislature, Minister of the
Crown, for a time Speaker of the Assembly, and
grandson of the Mrs. Reibey of old Sydney,
entered his 82nd year on Sept. 25. Reibey had
one real burst of grandeur—he was Tasmanian
Premier for a year, 1876-77. Most of the 25 years
since then he has been unsuccessfully applying fop
his brief old billet.
Captain Bobbie Towns, the first to intro-
duce the Kanaka in all his glory to Australian
coasts, was also the first to present a pulpit to the
local Church of England. Bobbie’s pulpit was a
central show at the opening of St. Andrew’s
Cathedral, Sydney. Perhaps this is why the
church has been howling for Kanaka labor ever
since.
Ex-Premier Peacock, of Victoria, was a
footballer in his early youth, and is described in a
football guide of 1878 as “A. Peacock, a rising
young player. Kicks well and should improve.”
Peacock, this week, had an opportunity of show-
ing how well he could kick, and he didn’t kick
Irvine nearly so efficiently as that Superior Per-
son deserved.
At the recent Coronation the Agents-
General were stuffed into a prison-like hole near
the roof of the Abbey, and saw absolutely nothing
of the ceremony. Worse still, Tozer contracted
neuralgia, his wife took a bad chill, Reeves was
frozen to the marrow and had cold feet, and the
whole boiling got angry and disgusted.
Stated at a meeting recently held in Mel-
bourne to revive the anti-opium crusade, that
action would have been taken before, if Brassey
had not been appointed Governor of Victoria, he
being interested in the opium traffic, and having,
officially and privately, done his utmost against
the movement in England. Apparently there
was more about Brassey than his mere passive
quality of falling off.
“ M.A.P.” prints an extraordinary story
about Fergus Hume lying on a sick bed in Mel-
bourne before the publication of his “Mystery of
a Hansom Cab,” and selling himself to the Devil
in the person of an actor who, in return for tem-
porary monetary assistance, exacted an agreement
that he should have half of the profits on all books
or plays subsequently produced by the invalid.
Hume, says the writer, rebelled after some years,
and in London instituted legal proceedings to free
himself ; but the action was cut short by the
actor —who then left Australia to maintain his
rights—shooting himself on the voyage to Eng-
land. Phil. Beck shot himself at Ceylon on his
way to the old country, and the cranky yarn
apparently points his way.
Doyle, the driver of the engine attached to
the ill-fated train which came to grief at Syden-
ham (N.S.W.) two years ago is (about to Jbe
again employed on the railway. After the
accident the Commissioners granted him
£5OO in satisfaction of all claims.
Although an apparently hopeless wreck
after the accident, he has now pulled
himself together wonderfully—absolutely
surprising the doctors. By the way, the
general opinion in well-informed rail-
way circles, notwithstanding the verdict
of the Coroner’s jury, is that the accident
was primarily due to some defect in the
permanent way.
A Picola (Vic.) aboriginal weather
prophet issues forecasts in the Nathalia
papers two months ahead , and they seem to
be worth more than the average. At least,
he foretold, in a general way, a patch of hot
weather in August, and good rains in his
district in September, and they both came
along.
Charles Bright has returned to the
Sydney Unitarian platform after an absence
of 20 years. Pew men have fought harder
for Unitarianism than he. Mrs. Bright, by
the way, is the widow of the Rev. Mr.
Pillars, formerly Minister in the same
church, who met a tragic death, many years ago,
by falling over a cliff at Sydney Heads. The
Sydney Unitarian Church is promised a new lease
of life now that it has replaced its mystic humbug
by a man of Mr. Bright’s ability and sincerity.
Archdeacon Gunther, who steps into the
historical Dean Cowper’s place in N.S.W. Church
of England business, is an Englishman of half a
century ago, though, by force of habit, most
people regard him as a Sydneyite. Forty years
back, he was a parson in Derbyshire, England, but
in 1866 took over St. Phillip’s, Sydney, with its
jangling bell-tower and other provocations to dis-
order.
There never was such a complete crawl on
the front of an expensive blouse as the Presby-
terian Ladies’ College reception of Melba. For
years the college authorities made resolute
attempts to stamp out the memory of her as one
who had fallen from grace. Now she is adopted
into Presbyterianism again, and if she wanted
the good old material Gehenna to boil her break-
fast egg with she could have it. She would even
be allowed to light the fire with the Shorter
Catechism without much protest.
When John Douglas left Thursday Island
on a visit to the old country his varied subjects

Chow Bow and Co., Sun Loy Goon, Tung Sing
Woh, Yawash, Lay Hing, Yen Kaw, See Kee
and Co., Kashiwagi Merandjami, Mee Lee, Hop
Sing and Yee Kee ! Donations ranged from £2O
to half-a-crown. Douglas may proudly boast that
on this occasion he received the most piebald
testimonial ever raised in Australasia.
Parson Worthington’s name has been

“W.8.M.” from S’Africa on the Boer
leaders :
De Web would shine as a journalist. He coins an epi-
gram with facility. He has a lively, laughing eye, and
is brimming over with geniality and good nature. The
barbarisms attributed to him are the inventions of ill-
informed press correspondents. There is nothing solid,
solemn, stiff or severe about De Wet. He is a wit, and
the war must, in many respects, have been a splendidly
sustained joke for him. De la Rey is a very unassuming
man, with a touch of sarcasm. Botha is a brave, resolute
fellow and a born diplomat. He will return a mighty
man to S.A., and then will maintain a leading position.
“ Crushing out individualism ” was Sydney
D.T.’s heading for its recent leader over Col. Tom
Parrott’s departure for S’Afriea. Well, the
words were Parrott’s own ;
and if his individualism has
been crushed out, it has
taken him a precious long
time to discover it. Just
28 years ago he joined the
N.S.W. Engineers, and he
has ever since regularly
drawn his pay from that
corps—ten years as lieuten-
ant, ten as captain, five as
major, and three as lieut-
colonel. He drew full pay
and allowances also for his
part in the Soudan lunacy,
and was afterwards sent on
the somewhat nebulous mis-
sion of a “special-service
officer ” to S’Africa. What
“special service” he per-
formed it would be interest-
ing to know, but, at all
events, he drew full pay and
allowances, and, returning
to Sydney, was employed
by the Works Department
as a railway-surveyor. Par-
rott seems to have a vague
idea that his individualism
has been crushed by the
Labor Party’s policy, but
when there was no Labor
Party he was just the same
comfortable hanger -on of
the State as he has been in
later years.
N. S. W. Government
will appoint three Railway
Commissioners for another
seven years ; it is quite likely
that Mr. Eehon (he is now
over 75 years of age) will
retire, and his place be filled
by Mr. Hugh M‘Lachlan,
at present secretary to the
Commissioners. Rumored
that as soon as the renewal
appointment is confirmed
the Commissioners will
stiffen their attitude to-
wards the tramway em-
ployees. Had the issue not
arisen in the last year of
their term, it is whispered,
they would never have acted
on the Parliamentary resolution in regard to an
eight-hours day for the tram conductors.
Squatter Splatt has just been figuring in
the Victorian law courts. It was Splatt, M.L.C.,

A Sydney sub-editor has been presented
by his reporting staff with a spirit-stand empty.
Amateur Colonel Reay quits Victorian
politics, in which he has shown himself not par-
ticularly brilliant for
two years. He leaves
for the reason that
politics and press-work
don’t combine, as many
another has found out.
Reay had many irons
in the fire and com-
bined his Melb. ’Ekald
editorship with swash-
bucklering, Parliament and frequent lecturing
on Gore, Cold Tea, etc. It is said that the
’Ekald proprietary was willing to stand all the
rest, but the paper began to be threatened
with political ideas, and a paper whose mission
in life is to relate how the skull of the deceased
was found on the doorstep couldn’t stand that.
Ex-Premier and ex-Agent-General Cock-
burn (S.A.), who has now become a permanent
guinea-pig and fixed absentee in London, was
much hurt because he received no ticket of
invitation to Westminster Abbey on the occasion
of the Coronation. The Colonial Office official
who revised the lists sent in by each State Agent-
General objected that Dr. Cockburn was not
connected in any representative capacity with
S.A.
Though Bent got back, Victoria had a chilly
welcome for that much pleasanter boom-time
politician, James Munro. Munro selected Rich-
mond as his field of operations, and the ghosts of
his dead land banka haunted him all through that
sordid, boot-factory suburb. It isn’t always
possible to tell by the meetings how the
election will turn out, but Munro’s recep-
tion in public was cold and miserable.
Nobody of any importance backed him on
his lonely platform. The crowd heaved football
jokes at him. Yet old white-headed James faced
the ghosts and the desolation and the contumely
with a courage that was worthy of a better banker,
and spoke his ancient platitudes manfully. But he
had lost the run of politics for so long that he was
obviously a back number. That is where Bent
has the advantage. The only interesting things
Bent has to say will never be quite out of da,te
while there is a bullock or a free fight or a public-
house in the land.

fated officers. Mr. Thomas is a solicitor of

“ S.A.” to The Bulletin :
Re the awful sacrifice of animal life out-back in Aus-
tralia through the present terrible drought. It seems
strange that, where large salt lakes or never-failing salt
wells are to be found, human ingenuity cannot separate
the salt from the water, and so prevent, at least, deaths
from actual thirst. Distillation per usual methods would,
of course, be too slow and too expensive. Now, it has
long been known that on the sea shore nearly fresh water
may be got by digging in the sand some small distance
from the salt-water margin. And if this nearly fresh
water is obtained because the sea-water, in filtering
through the sand, leaves the salt behind, I do not see
why same results could not be artificially obtained in the
drought-stricken districts. All that would be needed is a
supply of sufficiently fine sand. Also, we might improve
nature’s method and obtain a speedier result by whirling
the water through the sand, and so causing the separation
of the salt from the water, as sugar is separated from the
molasses in a sugar-mill. For this purpose I don’t see
why a team of bullocks could not be used if sufficient
steam could not be obtained. By working thus, when
bullock-feed was plentiful, a large and deep dam might
be kept full up to the very beginning of the drought, or
until “ feed ” gave out. At present the deepest dams are
often half-empty before the drought begins. If the water
will dribble or filter through the sand without much
pressure, a large tank, deep enough to give sufficient
pressure and furnished with a bottom formed of sand and
wire-netting, would furnish a continuous though tiny
stream, and so supply an equivalent to the evaporation.
A full dam, to begin a drought with, means a great
saving of stock, as sheep will live on next to nothing if
supplied with plenty of fresh water. It should be remem-
bered that the only thing necessary—if sand will eliminate
the salt—is to force the water through. Any method
that is cheap enough will do.

“ Typhoon ” : Many people who have shot
ring-tailed ’possums and found their ears missing
have been much puzzled over the matter. So was
I till I caught two alive—a full-grown and a half-
grown—and caged them. In about 10 days the
big chap had chewed the other’s ears clean off.
Sheep in drought country in N.Q. some-
times come in mud-fat, said fatness being a puzzle
to everyone on the station. Explanation—
quantities of bush hay have been blown into the
huge cracks in the ground and the sheep have
discovered the fact to their manifest advantage.
Sometimes weak sheep get into these cracks and,
while there, are tackled by the crows who pick
out their eyes while the poor wretches are too
feeble to extricate themselves.

“ Scutum ” : Be the bell-bird controversy.
I have ascertained that there are two distinct
kinds of bell-bird in N.S.W. “C.H.G.’s” bell-
bird (Oreoica cristata, Lewin) is to be found out
Dubbo way; while the one I referred to (8.,
12/10/’01) (Manorhina melanophrys, Lath.) is
found up in the North Coast districts.
• * * *
From the M‘Cooey :
Dear Bulletin,- In re the bell-bird ( Myzantha sp.).
The sound is “ cling-cling,” not “ clonk-clonk.” Phone-
tically, the sound is “ klingnegklinge ” —if that means
anything 1 None of the bell-bird genera can “ clonk-
clonk” or “won, won, bur’-illo ! ” They are not built
that way.
In re the voice of the Australian bell-bird.
There is a S. American one, as well. “ S.” (8.,
20/9/’O2) is a self-conceited fool. People of his type
are responsible for the thousands of absurdities
already foisted upon a people not given to ( think too much
for themselves. Among birds, Myzantha melanophyrs is
a soprano, and couldn’t say “clonk, clonk, won, won,
bur’-illo,” if its life depended upon it. “Bur’-illo” is
exquisite. The “soldier-bird” and the bell-bird are
closely allied. “ Won, won, bur’-illo I’’

A tick remedy from S’Africa :
“The cattle were kept in a paddock without water until
they were thoroughly thirsty, then quicklime and sulphur
were mixed with the water. In less than a month the
ticks were all dead in the paddocks and the cattle all
healthy."
Be that Salvation Army penitent who re-
cently bragged, in a moment of froth and fury,
that he had murdered two aborigines at Adavale
(Q.) 28 years ago. The first building was erected
in Adavale only 22 years ago. There was no such
place before then. The Army should make its
penitents rehearse their confessions in future, and
verify them with the atlas and the dictionary
before publication.

There is no old age pension law in S.A.,
but the ancient Ah Chows of the N. Territory get
there just the same. The old fossickers’ only sure
way of getting three meals in the 24 hours is to
supply the loafing blacks with opium while a
policeman is about; and, tired of perishing on a
pennyweight a week, they choose their time and
wait patiently for the summons—which, in their
case, means the dinner-bell. When it doesn’t
come—well, the police inspector puts it this way
in his last report:
The old and indigent Chinese are left behind on the old
goldfields to subsist as best they can, and numerous
deaths have taken place last year, traceable to insufficient
necessaries of life to sustain nature.

“Dhar”: The other day a resident of

“ Monkey-dodging,” as slang for muster-
ing sheep, is seldom heard nowadays; it is said to
have had its origin in the fact that the aborigines
in the early days never called a sheep anything
but a monkey—though what the aborigine knew
about monkeys it is hard to say.
“ Chasselas ” :
Re the general mini-
mising of the drought
in Victoria by the
newspapers, while
they barrack for a
prospective loan in
the London market
and for cheap fodder
for the graziers. Very
little wool and no
wheat going Cohen-
wards will bring the
truth out later. Pre-
sent year is the worst
experienced in S.W.
Victoria. There is
not a straw or a hay-
stack in the whole
district, or likelihood
of any grass. The
dams that are to
water a heavy in-
crease of stock from
further north are
drier than I have seen
them in midsummer
in ordinary years.
This is considered
one of the wet parts
of Victoria. The
position north of the
dividing range is ap-
palling, and farmers
there will either have to shift their stock' to
the coastal districts or let them die. The
Day of Humiliation and Prayer panned out
a few points of rain (predicted by the weather
department a week before praying started), a hard
frost, and cold, boisterous, drying winds since.
The Day of Humiliation and Prayer farce is pro-
nounced bogus in the face of the last few years’
experience. Why not set aside a day and a col-
lection for some rational water conservation
scheme? Writer would then join the show, and
humiliate in his shirt-sleeves with the best of ’em.

Two letters on the pelican’s-egg question :
“J.J.P.”: In answer to “ D.H.R.” (B. 20/9/'O2) re
pelicans’ eggs. I have seen thousands of them on certain
flood-water lakes, on Albemarle and Tolarno stations,
east bank of Darling. These lakes are 40 or 50 miles
from river, with which they are connected by natural
channel, though artificial aid is largely used, in the shape
of dams, to turn water out to lakes. Saw pelicans’ eggs
first in 1879 on Boolabulka and Ratcatcher Lakes ; the
birds laid on islands. Next saw them about 1892 or 1893,
and sent some of the eggs to Professor M‘Ooy, of Mel-
bourne University. The lakes I refer to are now all dry.
“ Boolabulka,” by the way, means, in blacks’ language,
“ Pelican Lake.”
“ Nymsie ” : lie pelicans’ eggs (“ D.H.R.” in Bulletin,
20/8/’O2). The reason pelicans’ nests are never found is
because the searchers don’t know the nest when they see
it. The nest of the orthodox, well-behaved mamma
pelican hangs under her beak. When not in use as a
nest, it is found to answer the purpose of a fish (or food)
receptacle. When the hatching season is on Mrs. Pelican,
having laid her eggs on the ground—three is a hatching
—scoops them into her capacious pouch, and there they
remain till hatched—or addled. This accounts for the
fact that “D.H.R.” has seen many young pelicans, but
never an egg or nest. The nest has probably walked past
him many times without him being aware of the fact.

“Thurla” : The crow up this way
(Barraba district, N.S.W.) is losing his cunning
ways, probably through familiarity with so much
dead stock lying around. Know of two men who
are catching them regularly by means of steel gin
traps left carelessly set upon the carcases. The
bird swoops down, treads on the plate—and there
he is. He has really got into the habit of assum-
ing that everything is dead except himself.
♦ * * *
“Thurla” writes :
“Pankaroo” (B. 13/9/’O2) strikes a true note re the
average Australian ruthless waste of timber, etc., by
indiscriminate ringbarking. Here in these Lower New
England mountains, the settlers go in for ringing almost
every tree on their lands; high mountains, valleys and
flats share the same fate. Once the timber is dead on
these mountains they will soon be washed bare of the
subsoil, consequently they must become barren ranges in
a few years. Notice that numbers of the selectors have
had to depend on the green timber (along the roads that
traverse their properties) to feed their starving stock.

The sky-pilot may know the way to
Heaven, but the bush beats him badly.
Catholic priest of Wallabadah (N.S.W.), was
called to a sick bed at Nundle, and started
rather late in a sulky. Was benighted an'd
got off the road; so he hitched the horse to a
tree, and took a tour round. He hit the track at
last, and then he couldn’t find his horse, Searched
all night for the horse, and two hours after day-
light found the patient animal still hitched to the
tree, and then lost the track again. Couldn’t find
the horse and the track simultaneously. When at
last he did get both of them, he didn’t know which
way he’d been going the night before, and was
nearly back to Wallabadah before he found him-
self. Then he turned round and drove to Nundle.

“ Bynnya ” ; Can any Bulletin reader
devise an effective remedy for the effects of
Darling pea on stock? The horses hereabouts
(Walgett district) are in a pitiable state through
eating the weed. Some horse-owners bleed the
affected animal, this course succeeding in few
cases, provided the horse is not allowed access to
the weed after the operation. A confirmed pea-
eater will eat nothing else, and after a short time
on it he begins to see snakes. A ride on a pea-
struck horse is a weird experience. Drinking
with a dangerous lunatic is nothing to it.

“ Quart-pot ” writes :
It. R. Kmickey’s par. (B. 20/9/’O2). My information
is not mixed. I state, and he bears me out, that D’Arcy
Uhr did cross from Queensland to Port Darwin before
Latour. I said nothing about his bringing cattle, and
d°n t know if he did or not. One Cox, however, had
started Wlth horses about the same time, which horses
were abandoned 80meW here about the head of the Gulf.
yp was to recover them Latour and Batten made the
journey back to Queensland, when latter was killed. The
mistake inputting two “l’s” instead of “tV’into the
name is your comp’s, not mine. [The mistake arose
through ‘‘ Quart-pot’s” careless handwriting ; if he had
crossed his “ts it wouldn’t have happened.—Ed.
B.] There were also others beside Phil. Saunders and
Adam Johns in party, when they came through. I don't
know how many, but one of them, Sandy Grant, I met on
the Etheridge many years after.
He is quite right in saying I speak from hearsay about
the shooting of the black at the Depot, but my evidence
was from men who were there—among them, Joe Ewart,
who was with the party (of which I also was a member)
that went to the Roper to try and capture Johnston’s
murderers. Ewart, whose death was referred to in your
columns, some time back, was afterwards stationed with
me at I owell’s Creek.
Latour got his cattle through, and they were bought
and slaughtered at Yam Creek [lt might be Yam or Tam,
°. r Yal " or Tain.—Ed. B.] where I was stationed at the
time, by Mr. Janies Aldridge, now of the Gresham Hotel,
Adelaide. As I spent four years—from 73 to 77—in the
Territory, between Port Darwin and Powell’s Creek, and
“L ne ) v ad the men alluded to, with the exception of
Nation, ar ] d also most of the other old hands, lam in a
" S oo< ‘ position to speak correctly. The exact details
°f Latour’s trip and quarrel with Nation and Elvey 1 can-
n°t speak about, and have no doubt Mr. Knuekey is cor-
J®ct, but lie fully confirms what I stated about D’Arc.v
. r being before Latour. As for the shooting of the
nigger, I am quite satisfied with what Ewart and others
me. If there was not some reason for the murder of
Johnston, how was it the niggers behaved so well to
Latour on his arrival at Leichhardt’s Bar, a short time
previously?

“ Yarrum” : Was standing once on Gun-

thrown off at Wagga, and made a charge at the
next train, with the result that he got under the
wheels. When Billy heard, he shed bitter tears,
and told us the animal’s pedigree. Also, he men-
tioned that he always had a “’ell of a set on en-

as an ant, and always tried to bite engines. Then
Billy dried his tears and made for the camp to tell

“ Werrimee ” : Re edible native plants.
The most common bush substitutes for cabbage
are stinging-nettles and fat-hen. The latter
grows to a height of 7ft. or Bft., but is only eaten
when young and tender. Both are plentiful on
the Richmond and Clarence. Pigweed, before it
flowers, makes an excellent dish. It grows all
over N.S. W., even on the Stony Desert. Boil, chop
up, and season with pepper, salt, vinegar, and hard-
boiled eggs (hard-boiled eggs can always be found
in the Stony Desert). Warrigal-spinach, plentiful
round waterholes in Mt. Brown (N.S. W.)district,
is relished by both whites and blacks. Yams,
roasted in ashes, are a good substitute for potatoes.
Por puddings, try stewed cherries* wild black-
berries, and wild oranges (latter plentiful onWard
River, Q.), and for dessert, quondongs, moolie-
apples, geebungs, and wild strawberries*. The
latter grow on a prickly creeper, the leaves of
which are a potent remedy for dysentery. Sarsa-
parilla vines, found in abundance among the
ranges of the upper Richmond, make a splendid
drink when boiled.

labor: “Wanted lad, good home and wages,
farm.” The “lad” is 20 to 25, and must be
strong. He has to fetch in cows (often in the
dark), milk, snatch some damper and cooky’s joy,
drive to the creamery, feed the calves, scald the
cans, cut chaff or cart maize, fill up again with
bread and “long lick,” go falling and grubbing,
put up the calves, tea and treacle again, chop fire-
wood, then shell corn or chop turnips. Pay, Bs. a
week, three months’ engagement, and fare paid
one way if time completed.

Burra races were coming off on tiie

After tea on Friday night a heavy thunderstorm
raised hopes, but the pannikin showed only half-

on Monday. Ye know me. No play, no pay.”
The ensuing purse was worth a good £2, but no
Particulars could be got from Jimmy, who knew
ow to “go alone,” and would only repeat, “No
play, no pay.” Now, Jimmy knew that the boss
had a rough-and-ready method of determining wet
sheep (20 points, 1 day ; 50 points, 2 days ; over
an inch, 3 days), and late that night he Stole
quietly to the front garden and poured a copious
libation into the rain-gauge. Saturday morning
the boss: “Good morning, boys.” Shearers:
“Good morning, boss. A heavy storm last
night?” “Be gobs it was. A lot heavier than I
thought.” “ What was there, boss? (hopefully)—
an inch?” “165 points. Cut-out, boys ; there’ll
be no more shearing till next Tuesday.” An
eloquent wink fluttered along the “board,” while
Jimmy, behind the wool-press, patted a pocketful
of silver and “orders,” beatifically.

“S.F.” on snakebite •
To which an expert:
Melb. University
rof. O. J. Martin,
while lecturer on
physiology at
Sydney Medical
School, practic-
ally proved that
the use of an
anti venine would
be the method of
treating venom-
ous snake-bite.
Interesting in
this connection
is the case, re-
ported in a re-
cent British
Medical Jour-
nal by an Indian
military sur-
geon, of a cobra-
stricken youth
brought to him
in articulo mor-
tis. He at once
injected antive-
nine, and—wise
man supple-
mented it by
artificial respira-
tion, &c. The
patient recover-
ed.
Was toldithere
was a horse in
or about Sydney
that couhi sup-
ply “me and
my friends”
with antivenine,
should the oc-
casion unhap-
pily occur.
That was a
year ago and
this particu-
lar horse may
have gone to
S’Africa or
the Zoo ere
now. But with
plenty of time
and plenty of horses,
the Sydney Board of
Health should be able
to manufacture its own
anti-poisons.
It should scarcely be
necessary to cite analogies
In support of this method of
treatment, but I may mention the
antitoxin of diphtheria and its admitted
results. Serotherapy is an infant of days—but
itsplace in practical treatment is absolutely assured.
Why then has not the Board of Health set forth to the
public in simple language the possibilities of the antitoxin
treatment of snakebite? Also, why isn’t every local
doctor and chemist either supplied with or compelled to
stock a tube or two of antivenine ? And where there isn’t
any local butcher or chemist, why not compel every
employer of bush labor to have on hand an adequate
supply of this possible life-preserver ?
Serum therapy is admitted by scientists to be the
coming thing for snakebite, but as yet, too little is
definitely known to admit of its indiscriminate issue.
Fraser, of Edinburgh, Calmette, and Martin, of Melb.,
have done valuable work, and it is probable that their
work will go far towards clearing up the mystery of
antitoxin action in general. Calmette has proved that
this is not due to direct action in the blood by the
“antitoxin,” but to some stimulation of the resistant
tissues. Exact details are not yet worked out, but the
same process will probably be found to apply also to
diphtheria, tetanus, etc. The breaking-up of red,
corpuscles, ordinarily produced by black-snake venoms
does not occur in an animal
so immunised, and large
doses of venom introduced
into the stomach produce a
similar immunity against
hypodermically - administer-
ed venom. The immunised
horse spoken of by “ S.F.”
is still extant, and has a
relative in Melb. For pre-
liminary experiments rab-
bits are generally used, but
when large quantities of
serum are required horses
are more convenient. The
process, takes some 15
months for its completion,
gradually increasing doses
of venom being injected
mixed with decreasing doses
of hypochlorite of lime, the
latter controlling the toxic
action of the serum. Several
varieties of snake-venom are
used during the immunisa-
tion procedure, and at its
conclusion an occasional
large dose will keep the
serum supply going for a
long period. The animals
do well under it, and appear
to actually thrive vigorously
after the first few weeks.
Reverting to “ S.F.’s” pro-
posal, the use of antivenine
serum by laymen would pro-
bably do little good, and,
•apart from the mental
aspect of the snake-bitten,
the low mortality in this
country does not justify
Govt, distribution of ex*
pensive and half-tried reme-
dies while the existing ones
give good results.

■'(Misplaced remark from an Indian mis-
Sionary papei •
Opponents of missions to the Jews have sometimes
calculated the cost of such conversions. As far as we
remember, the estimates vary from £BOO to £l2OO.
According to a return made by the Red Cross Society at
Johannesburg, the number of Boers killed and wounded
during the war amounted to 3750. As the war has cost
£225,000,000, it follows that to shoot a Boer costs not less
than £60,000. This is even more expensive than con-
verting a Jew.
The cost of converting a Jew has really been
est i ra ated at £12,000, not £l2OO, and he almost
, hno-ns .Tew after all or plsh
always proved to be a bogus Jew alter an, or else
out; of his mind. Anyway, even if it is true that
one can convert five, or fifty, sham Jews into
Christians for the money it costs to convert one
Boer into a corpse, it doesn’t seem any sufficient
reason w hy money should be wasted on either

his beer in 1855: “ Anyone drinking more than
four glasses of this potent beverage at one sitting

“ Petramos ” : Re communicative men.
In Adelaide, one night, got into conversation with
a man I had never seen before and walked to my
hotel with him. Pub advertised its position as
one minute’s walk from where I met him, so very
likely it was two. Anyhow, during the walk he
informed me that there was nothing doing up
town, compared Adelaide streets at night with
Melbourne and Sydney, said he’d won a double
and just drawn the money, which he showed me.
Also told me how he had “ got on ” or “ comeoff”
during the last couple of racing seasons and put
me in the way of a good thing for a coming
-meeting. By that time we reached the pub and
parted.

Sickly Children
‘Her own dear little self again,
thanks entirely to Scott’s
Emulsion”
In these trying winter weeks one hears
everywhere the cry of the children, disease
so easily breaks down their tender strength.
Every mother should answer that cry in
this way:
“5, Stanley Vfllas, Westberry Avenue,
“ Green Lanes, London, England,
“ April 22nd, 1901.
“ Dear Sirs,— My little daughter, two
years of age, had a very bad attack of
whooping cough last autumn. I tried
everything I could for her, but could not
got her well, and she fell away to almost
nothing. Beading of many who had bene-
fited by Scott’s Emulsion, I decided to
try the preparation for my child, and
lam very thankful I did so. In a few
weeks, after taking Scott’s Emulsion, there
was a very material improvement in her
condition, and the cough was not nearly
so harsh or distressing. What rather sur-
prised me was the quickness with which she
PHYLIS AUDRY WILLS.
(From a photograph.)
acquired a taste for Scott’s Emulsion; she
really wanted more than was good for her.
I soon felt we were on the right track.
You may be interested to know my wife
prooured a bottle of emulsion from a
chemist, stated to be ‘theirj own make,’ but
it did not have the least effect upon baby,
and after that we would have nothing but
* Scott’s.’ Now when I look at my child
and remember what she was a few months
ago, I can scarcely believe she is the same
little one. She is thoroughly well, strong,
and healthy, and her own dear little self
again, thanks entirely to Scott’s Emulsion.
“ Yours very sincerely,
“ (Signed) Edward Wills.’’
Whooping cough is, of course, only one of
the many children's illnesses flying about
just now. Measles, mumps, bronchitis,
rickets, marasmus, poor digestion, anaemia,
scarlet fever, these are some of the un-
pleasant words one hears in all directions.
In every case of these diseases Scott’s Emul-
sion should at one stage or another be
given—Scott’s Emulsion will cure. There
is nothing to be obtained anywhere that is
half so good for sickly children. Your own
doctor will agree to this.
And your own sense will agree that you
cannot hope for the striking results pro-
duced by Scott’s Emulsion if you buy
something else. You may be offered what'
is said to be “ just as good,’’ but the seller
of such imitation or substitute has no
evidence of what he says, and can produce
none, for the simple reason that Scott’s
Emulsion is the standard children’s remedy
on which all others are modelled. Mr.
Wills’s experience with one of these “just
as good ” preparations shows you exactly
what to expect from them. No imitation
is ever as good as the original.
Mr. Wills emphasises another striking
point about Scott’s Emulsion —how nice it
is to take: “she really wanted more than
was good for her.’’ This is the great ad-
vantage Scott’s Emulsion has over common
cod-liver oil, which no one ever wants to
take! And then, medicinally, Scott’s Emul-
sion is, according to the comparative tests
of a distinguished physician, “ three times
as efficacious as the same amount of
common cod-liver oil.”
Eor these reasons see that the picture cf
a man carrying a big fish is on the wrapper
of every bottle ; if they are there you have
Scott’s Emulsion.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpeneeto Scott & Bowne, Ltd.
483 Kent street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

to make the State servants pay for it.

Sydney City Council is said to be consider-
ing the advisability of calling for tenders for the
purchase of the choice selection of germ-laden
rags on the Moore Park tip, so that they may re-
appear amongst us as the stuffing for the time-
payment mattress and the best parlor couch. This
was set down as the most interesting lie Sydney
had heard for some time, as it was thought that
the least disinfected of aldermen could hardly
contemplate such a thing, until the Council owned
up to the impeachment.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne, is the largest buyer of
Opals, Sapphires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their pax-cels direct to him. The firm lias
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honoi-ably treated. A trial par-
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance,
is solicited.
If the cabled assertion of the secretary of
the British Decimal Association, to the effect that
290 out of the 070 members of the House of Com-

adoption of the metric system of weights and

be improving. The last days of these horrible
British arithmetical tables in which 5J yards make
something and 301 square yards make something
else, have been long delayed, and thousands of
children have been driven mad or nearly so trying
to learn the needlessiy complicated horrors. In
humanity’s name they can’t be abolished too soon.

MAGNESIA
Alien Labor in the West.
The first Commission issued by the Federal
Government was directed to Mr. Roe, a Perth
P.M., to inquire into the influx of foreigners in
Westralia; and the report, widely reprinted,
declares, that there is nothing whatever in the
i fears and complaints of the Westralian Labor men
who had the inquiry made. The report is really
a most unfortunate one, though, and gives not
even a glimmer of the true inwardness of the
situation. About the only valuable observation
the Commissioner makes is this-: —
Mine managers agree that it.-is a good thing for a.mine
to haw mixed-na,fck>nalitfes working in the mine. Better
results are obtained by •working the one against the
other.
The Commissioner-evidently thinks this n.ew idea
in mine management a very find thing indeed,
and most desirable. In other places, in order to
support his view, he quotes witnesses^:—
When British and Italians work together there-is ill-
feeling amongst them. (D.&. Freeman-, Managar‘of the
King Solomon (r. M-. Co., Ltd.)
Oapt. Rodda, of the Associated Northern, said he finds
if you keep a certain percentage of each nationality you
can get a lot of work done, but-if you let one nationality
get into the majority you are -in their power. (G-.
Houghton, Manager of the W.A. Goldfields Fireioood
Supply, Ltd.)
* * * *
Mr. Roe is almost indignant at the suggestion
that the Italians and others accept lower wages,
and, as usual, he quotes two or three sentences,
torn from their context, to support his view.
Somebody else might take quite as many scraps
to support quite another view—
Newly-arrived Italians agreed to pay the boss Italian
£5 for the privilege of being employed at a mine. This
£5 was kept out of the wages of the men at the rate of
about 10s. per week, and immediately the whole of the
money had been paid these men, or some of them, were
discharged. (Fergie Reid, M.L.A.)
Frequently the newly-arrived Italian, not being
acquainted with the rates, accepts service at a lower rate
than our countrymen. (Tuos. Beasley, Sec. A. W.A.)
Some bosses take advantage of new chum Italians. (J.
Gknoni.)
But, after all, the point is not so much whether
Italians and English speakers get the same rate
of pay as it is whether the large influx of ad-
mittedly very ignorant Italians and Austrians
does not tend to reduce the standard of pay all
round. Finally, Mr. Roe says :
I think several of the witnesses have made out a strong
case against foreigners, unable to speak English, being
put to underground, dangerous work, with Englishmen,
who cannot understand them. Such a practice, if it
existed, would naturally be dangerous ; but there is no
evidence that such is the case.
• • * *
Most likely there was no evidence, because the
Commissioner did not go where it was available.
“There are undoubtedly more foreigners em-
ployed on the Murchison goldfields than on our
eastern goldfields,” he reports ; yet he did not go
there ! The Great Fingall employs 181 foreigners
in a total of 613 ; the Morning Star, 28 out of 31.
Yet, having taken no evidence regarding those
mines or that district, he says “there is no
evidence” of what, if it takes place anywhere, is
most likely to take place there. But, though the
Commissioner took no evidence, J. B. Holman,
M.L.A. for the district, sent him a statement in
which he declared :
On July 1, ’99, the manager of the Great Fingal
endeavoured to reduce the wages of all miners, truckers,
and laborers ; work ceased for nine weeks. During this
time an Italian came to Day Dawn, stating he had secured
all or nearly all underground work on contract, only
offering, however, the reduced rate of wage. The men
refused. Ceruti (the Italian) threatened to get Italians
to work the mine, stating that they would work for the
reduce d rate. . . . Shortly after Italians kept coming into
the mine in parties.
Since the attempted reduction of wages at Day Dawn
Italian labor has been largely introduced there. At Pad-
dington, about May, 1900, a reduction of wages was
brought about, Italian labor being employed to do it.
* * • *
Though printed after the evidence the Com-
missioner makes no reference to this statement.
Even without the statement the report is
lopsided, and looks like the work of a man
who, having opinions of his own, kept his
eye glued on those scraps of evidence which tallied
with his own groper ideas. But lopsided before,
Mr. Holman’s statement, if it can be maintained
(Mr. Holman is the M.P. for the Murchison
district), knocks the Commissioner’s report clean
over; and the report ought, therefore, to have
been sent back to him for a more complete in-
vestigation. Or, better still, it should have been
sent to somebody not so obviously partial.
Meantime, among the things which the evidence
does sustain, it is good to find that the Westralian
Labor people’s objection to the foreigner ends as
soon as ever he begins to identify himself with
Australian life and progress, and that they are
also alive to the wisdom of roping him into the
unions at the earliest possible moment.
The Bloated Maoriland Agriculturist,
Last month Maoriland Farmers’ Union held a
conference at Wellington, and among many other
resolutions passed one to the effect that “taxation
through the customs should be for the purpose of
raising revenue and not for protective purposes,
i.e., the undue bolstering up of industries.” The
discussion that preceded the carrying of the reso-
lution proved beyond a doubt that the Farmers’
Union is prepared to commit any crime so that
the Labor legislation of the past 12 years may be
swept away. The chief end of the Union is cheap
labor on its farms It recognises that it is im-
possible to repeal all the laws which have estab-
lished Courts of Arbitration and done so much to
make the life of the worker worth living. Speaker
after speaker pointed out that the present im-
pregnable position of labor in Maoriland was due
to the Protective duties. The duties made work
in the country ; they made the workmen pros-
perous, and found them the means to fight organ-
ised Capital in the Arbitration Court and at the
general elections. Therefore the key of the Labor
position was the maintenance of the Protective
duties. If those duties could be abolished town
employment would become scarce, the Arbitration
Court would be powerless to award good living
wages in the teeth of cut-throat competition of
foreign manufacturers who worked with cheaper
labor, longer hours, more highly organised
systems and better machinery—and therefore the
cheap labor for which the Farmers’ Union craves
would become plentiful. The farmers think they
can rely upon the parsons, the bush men, the
gum-diggers, all the country settlers, school-
teachers and civil servants to join in the
howl for lower duties and a “ free break- j
'ast-table.” This effort of the organised j
'urnip.growing classes to wreck the prosperity of j
che town workers is an example of the blackest I
ngratitude in political history. But for the land j
policy of the Ballance Government—a Labor
Government in the strictest sense of the term — |
there would have been no farmers in Maoriland ;
worth speaking of. The farmers, who are repre !
sented by the Union, are the product of the revo- ;
lution which brought the Arbitration Court into
existence. Till the socialistic Government came I
along the farmer was ground under the heel of the
squatter, the landlord, the bank, and the loan and ■
mortgage eo. The Labor and Protectionist Govern-
ment taxed the big estates with a graduated land-
tax, it compulsorily resumed land for closer settle-
ment, and founded an Advances to Settlers
department. Altogether it did more, at an infi-
mtely greater cost, for the farmer than it did for
any othei-class. And now that the sordid agri-
culturist feels safe on his feet he wants to destroy
the prosperity of the class that helped him
to affluence, and he hopes to accomplish the
atrocity by means of the “ free, breakfast-table ”
cry. As a blind and suicidal person he
ought to take a top seat in.history. He wants to
reduce the prosperity-what he regards as the
blastiferous arrogance ”-of the city worker, be-
cause,.if it is done, he will be able, in the general
reduction of wages, tp -get cheaper labor on his
farm at the tail of the muddy plough, and in
pursuit o.f the damp, unpleasant heifer. And if he ,
suqceeds he will reduce the prosperity of the class
which buys bis produce, and it will buy. less ; and
also many of his customers will be driven away
and will buy nothing at all. At present the
-Maoriland farmer is. by. many miles the most
prosperous agriculturist ; in Australasia but he
does® t know when to let well alone. He wants
Sy to ‘tW*4
of his customers, and that if a great portion of the
revenue obtained by the customs duties is lost-, the
loss of it will have to be made good by more direct
taxation on land and incomes, and then the Maori-
land farmer may expect to go where the British
one has gone.
The Flyspeck’s Engine-driver.
As a sample of the kind of industrial legislation
that gets on to the Statutes of a State that
possesses no Labor-members, Tasmania’s new In-
spection of Machinery Act ought to fill many a
long-felt coffin. It is provided that the Chief-
Inspector shall, fora fee of 305., grant a Certificate
of Service to “ any person who has been in charge
or had control of any machinery worked or pro-
pelled by steam, power for one year prior to the
passing of this Act.” Another clause provides
that any male of 21 years who holds such Certifi-
cate of Service may take charge of any steam
machinery whatever, including a winding engine
for mining purposes ! Which means that any
man or boy who, for one year, has had con-
trol of a donkey engine or a steam merry-
go-round, may, for 305., procure a license
to send a cageful of miners to Kingdom Come.
Tasmanian legislators are evidently not the sort
of people who descend or ascend mining shafts as a
regular thing. The precious Act also ukases
that :
No other engine or boiler (other than a winding engine
is meant) exceeding 8 h.p. shall be left in charge or con-
trol of any person unless he is a male of at least 18 years
of age and holds a Certificate of Service—as above men-
tioned.
Therefore, any engine under 8 h.p. may be driven
to smithereens by a boy of 14, or a girl of 12, for
anything the Act says to the contrary, and quite
regardless of whether either child knows a steam-
engine from a sewing-machine. And this is indus-
trial legislation in the land of Dodery.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Victorian Premier Irvine delivered his
programme at Nhill, and the thing he said and
the place he said it at were much the same.
One of the Philp Govt.’s cruellest strokes
in the direction of economy lies in the reduction of
that endowment to hospitals. Many of the Queens-
land country hospitals must inevitably close under
the new arrangement. And Brisbane is calmly
building a new (and superfluous) Lands Office at a
cost of nearly £250,000.
A Bill making primary education free has
now been carried three times in N.S.W. Assem-
bly. Twice the Leg. Council killed it, and that
body is expected to wreck it the third time. Free
education is law in Queensland, Victoria, Wes-
tralia, Maoriland, almost all over Canada, and in
numbers of other places.
Daley, of N.S.W. Assembly, hasn’t yet gone
down with that axe and demolished the Federal
Government’s pretensions to own the military
station at Dawes Point, Sydney. His best way
out of the difficulty now is to say that the
nefarious Federal tariff has put the prioe of axes
op so high that he can’t afford it.
Arnold White in the London Express :—.
, ®reation of an Australian navy should be accepted
ny the British taxpayer as equivalent to separation.
That is the root of the English hostility to an
Australian navy ; our politicians have crawled in
vain, and our farm-burners have burned in vain.
At heart England thinks that Australians can’t be
trusted with a navy.
One objectionable feature of N.S.W.
Arbitration Court procedure is that while Presi-
dent Cohen goes on circuit, Messrs. Cruickshank
and Smith, the lay members of the Court, lie by
ijjTd raw their salaries of £750 each all the time.
Mr. Cohen knocks off work to carry bricks. The
other two have to knock off work and look at
Cohen carrying bricks.
A small meeting in Brisbane has voted in
favor of secession from the Commonwealth. But
Brisbane was always anti-Federal, so as an
evidence of any wild or general revulsion of feel-
ing this amounts to nothing at all. If such a
meeting could be held at Charters Towers without
the promoters having slag thrown at them it
might mean something.
Plunkett, Queensland M.L.A., is advo-
cating secession on the ground that Federation is
going to land Queensland in “individual and
national insolvency.” Plunkett is backed up by
certain of the Q. Ministers who have been steadily
assuring Bananalanders that the country is
“financially sound,” and that they anticipate a
surplus of £lO,OOO next year.
The economics of Philpian administration.
The Lindon Bates dredges have put the Q. Trea-
sury nearly .£200,000 to the bad. Expenses for
repairs have been heavy and continual, and one
dredge is practically hors de combat. Now comes
an inquiry into the whole business of purchase
and working, which inquiry costs £982 Is. 10d.,
chairman of Inquiry Committee drawing £205.
It is cabled that “the confidence which
the people of Johannesburg have in Lord Milner
is significant.” But just at present who are the
people of Johannesburg—the 25,000 discharged
irregulars; the thousands of blacks who won’t
take the Is. a day wage offered for work in the
mines; the sandbaggers and murderers ; or the
few scores of returned mine bosses and specu-
lators ?
Melbourne reporters, who have been up and
down and roundabout on the track of candidates
throughout this campaign in Victoria, declare
that the one note which provoked unanimous
approval was an expression of the advisability of
abolishing the State Houses and trusting every-
thing outside municipal politics to Federal govern-
ment. ‘ ‘ One People one Parliament ” seems to be
the coming cry.
Westralian Labor Congress has decided in
favor of Labor M.’sP. being paid £3OO per year
instead of £2OO as at present. It was resolved,
subject to approval by a trades referendum, that
the additional £lOO be raised by the unions.
Such an action gives the unions a hold on their
members, and so prevents lapses in cases where a
member has got into the habit of being re-elected,
and forgets to whom it is due.
The Post and Telegraph Rates Act, to come
into force on Nov. 1, will spoil many ways of
looting the Treasury. Vic. Govt., for instance,
had a habit of subsidising all kinds of charitable
shows by giving the promoters, if of the right
political color, 1000 or so franked envelopes. A
habit of N.S.W. Govt, was to give country agri-
cultural associations half-rate telegrams for one
month prior to and during the annual shows.
Twenty-five out of 95 members of the
Victorian Assembly were returned . unopposed,
and of these 23 (including eight Ministers) were
supporters of the Irvine Government. Dr.
Maloney for the Labor party and Mitchell, a
Peacockite, made up the balance. The last straw
was when Peacock himself collapsed with a lung-
trouble, and that frail-looking leader —who,
despite his run-down physical condition, promised
at the eleventh hour and 59th minute, to make
things hot for the Kyabramapootra in his lair —
was put to bed and forced to abandon active
participation in the fight.
From the Worker (Queensland) :
Strange that the Brisbane dailies have completely
ignored or suppressed the sensational evidence given at
the Morant court-martial by prominent Queensland con-
tingenters, including Lieutenant Oolin Philp, son of
Premier Philp. According to young Philp, the Queens-
land Mounted Infantry were “in disgrace” on one
occasion for bringing in prisoners instead of summarily
dispatching them. In other words, they were “in
disgrace ” for not doing what Morant and Handcock were
executed for 1
Both Age and Argus meanly represented
Trenwith as being thrown over by Labor, whereas
the Labor Council merely put up one candidate
for the two Richmond seats, and left Trenwith to
run on his own, just as at Fitzroy it let
O’Connor go alone and ran Billson for one of the
two seats. Trenwith is as much trusted by the
Trades Hall as ever, but he declined to bind him-
self, in writing, to the party platform, as he had
done all along.
It is finally decided that any State member
who proposes to be a Federal candidate must
resign his State membership 14 days before he is
nominatedinhisFederal capacity. All that is really
needed is a law providing that the new member
must resign his State billet the day after he is
elected to the Federal Parliament, failing which
his Federal position becomes vacant automatically.
The method adopted seems more like an attempt
to be mean and cantankerous than anything else.
Labor leader M‘Gowen was enthusiastic-
ally commending the day-labor system last week
in N.S. W. Assembly when Broughton Barnabas
O’Conor asked if his new house at North Sydney
was being put up by day-work or contract. And,
instead of replying straight out that it was being
built by day labor, and calling his interrogator
Barabbas Bosh O’Conor, M‘Gowen said that it
was unmanly to make a personal reference, and
that the two “ B’s ” man had fallen in his estims
tion.
HOLDING THE FORT.
Federal Minister Bill Lyne is going to hold Dawes Point for the Commonwealth by military
force if necessary. Daley, M.L.A., of N.S.W., says that if necessary he and his constituents
will recover the lost territory with axes. The Bulletin’s artist shows the battle just about to begin.
The attack of Carruthers and Ashton on
the See Government’s budget was as weak
as a newly-born kitten, and not nearly so efficient.
They hadn’t the courage to attack the borrowing
policy, for they want to borrow also. They
weren’t game to denounce the nefarious swindle
of using about £1,000,000 a year of loan money as
revenue, for if they got into office on that count
they would have the heavy responsibility of
putting the swindle right. They couldn’t com-
plain much of the increase of expenditure, for
fear of being asked if they wanted to cut down
wages and abolish old-age pensions. They hadn’t
the pluck to demand more taxation to put
things right. A man standing up with a pot of
beer in his hand and froth on his moustache isn’t
able to denounce drink with a ay impressiveness,
and that was exactly their position.
Tommy Bent on Labor members : “ These
men spend no money, they give no employment ,
and yet they say they are Labor men ! ” Tommy
is one of the boomsters who spent money most
lavishly (other people’s), and gave no end of
employment. The debris of the burst institutions
is not all removed yet. Bent’s idea that the
Labor member spends no money is evidently
based on a wrong impression that he gets his
boots and clothes out of the deposits, and he
seems to be under the delusion that a Labor
member professes to be a Flinders-lane sweater
and employer of labor—which he doesn’t.
The feeble efforts of a few sore-headed
fossils in Tasmania, W.A., and Queensland to
separate from the Commonwealth are historical
repetitions of what went on in the U.S. and
Canada when their union was achieved. It is
impossible in a year or two to shake down a
number of States into one plan of housekeeping
without hitches arising. The worst trouble,
however, arises out of the damaged dignity of the
Men Who Were Left Behind. Their mana
is diminished, and their efforts to assert what
importance remains to them by picking quarrels
at every possible opportunity makes most of the
trouble.
“Gumleaf ” writes :
Bulky Bent, Irvine’s Minister for Railways, lost his
head at Nhill and made a speech calculated to give away
the great conservative conspiracy against the workers of
Victoria. In a most violent oration Bent denounced the
Factories Act and said the Ministry would never allow
such a measure on the Statute-book if it could help it.
He called the Labor members of the Leg. Assembly a set
of loafers, and generally let the Tory cat out of the bag.
The speech was the talk of the political world, but not a
word of it appeared in the two big Melbourne dailies that
are aspiring to run Victoria. But there are compensa-
tions. By way of making up for the absence of the thing
Bent did say, that time when he threw his 2cwt. of indig-
nant political meat up against the sky at Nhill, the
things the Labor members didn’t say are appearing regu-
larly.
Maoriland, despite the Jingo fever, has
not altogether lost sight of practical progressive
legislation. The Mortgages of Land Act of last
year enables everyone of average intelligence to
execute a mortgage deed; all the conditions
usually set out at length in a deed are implied by
the new statute. Another useful measure is the
Money-Lenders Act which compels all money-
lenders to be registered, and forbids them to carry
on business in any other but the registered name.
Provision is made empowering the courts to re-
open all unconscionable money-lending transac-
tions. Another very sensible reform is the
Testators’ Family Maintenance Act, which
enables a Judge of the Supreme Court to remodel
any will (on due cause being shown) so as to pro-
vide for those whom the testator (or testatrix)
would have to maintain if living.
Recent cablegrams from Ireland show that
things are not running too smoothly in England’s
Poland. Apropos Barry O’Brien in his recent
book, “A Hundred Years of Irish History,”
speaks of the Land League : “If it had not been
violent and lawless it would not have succeeded.
The only chance you have of making an impression
on an English Minister, where Ireland is con-
cerned, is by coming to him with the head of a
landlord in one hand, and the tail of a cow in the
other.”-
One thing in particular should be insisted
on by members on both sides of N.S.W. Assembly
before they give the Government to Carruthers :
He should be compelled to give a pledge that
whenever his Government is charged with extra-
vagance he will not throw his hands up and yell,
“ You are damaging the reputation of the State !”
See did that; Lyne, Reid, Dibbs, Parkes —all
traded on the gag. The community can stand a
lot in a Premier, but that gag is so emaciated
that its tombstone should be ordered.
That Tory N.S.W. organisation, “The
Taxpayers’ Union,’' gave the whole show away at
Parramatta recently. It was stated there that
the Union is “intended to serve as a sort of
political watchdog—something which would take
an uncompromising attitude towards the Labor
party.” Further, there was a call for men like
Irvine, of Victoria, and a yell fora “Kyabram
platform ” in N.S.W. One speaker objected
“to those monstrosities of legislation—Old-Age
Pensions, Early Closing, Arbitration, and the
like.”
State Premier Jenkins Iscariot of S.A.
has asserted his blessed dignity by refusing to
answer a question put by the British Government
because it was sent through Federal Acting-
Premier Deakin. Jenkins stood out solidly for
his right to come into direct contact with titled
persons in England, and for the time at least the
country has been saved. It is to be hoped, how-
ever, that Jenkins’ silly pretensions will be cast
aside. We don’t want seven Governments writing
to J. Chamberlain, any more than we want seven
Ambassadors in London.
When Treasurer Waddell explained that
the See Government had spent the biggest revenue
N.S.W. ever possessed, and also suspended part
of the payments in reduction of the old deficit,
and annexed a lot of trust funds, and still failed
to make ends meet, Labor-leader M ‘Gowen got
up and congratulated it warmly and whitewashed
it enthusiastically. The folly of the Labor Party
in thus gratuitously associating itself with a
bankrupt and dishonest policy, and lending its
iendly hand to smack a shapeless and discredited
oack, is beyond words.
Hobart Tramway Co., mostly owned and
directed by London absentees, not satisfied with
having secured the right to run its weird bone-
shaking cars through 11 miles of Hobart streets
for ever, is now approaching Tas. Parliament to
secure electric-lighting rights in the dreary city.
As the only electric-lighting thereabouts is at pre-
ent controlled by another monopoly, the Gas
Co. (wherein, it is stated, most of the aldermen
are shareholders), the ratepayers don’t mind much
how the new move pans out. The average person
would as soon have one brick fall on him as an-
other.
The proposal that Australia should contri-
bute £200,000 annually towards the maintenance
of the Imperial squadron in Australian waters
should hurry along the creation of our own fleet,
manned by our own sailors. Chile, with a j opu-
lation of two-and-three-quarter millions, maintains
an efficient fleet of 43 fighting ships and torpedo
craft. Holland, with about five million people,
has a fleet of 23 ships, which are spoken highly of
by British naval authorities ; Denmark, with less
than two-and-a-half millions of people, has nine
warships and about 41 gunboats and torpedo craft.
Even broken, bankrupt Greece, with about two-
and-a-half millions, runs five respectable armored
ships and seven torpedo crafts. And Australia
can surely do as well as a half-bred Spanish South
American republic or a Dutch monarchy.
When the Victorian Parliament met four
months ago, nearly every member had something
to say in defiance of Kyabram and the sort of
reform the man from the Rodney irrigation-
swindle area was seeking. Those who didn’t get
their opinions into Hansard said the same thing
without reservation in the lobbies. There were
only three men in the Assembly who identified
themselves with the Kyabram agitation—Nicholls,
Keogh, and Downward —and those far-seeing
nonentities were marked down as political pariahs.
When Nicholls spoke on the Peacock Reform Bill,
he was howled out of countenance, and he could
have had a fight with bare knuckles, or a score of
them, any time he liked. Various Peacockites
declared to that effect, anyway, when the outcast
Kyabram mer was out of hearing. Also, they
asserted, with great unanimity, that the reign of
the political press was at an end, and Parliament
was going “on its own” for the future. But the
press is still top dog, and will remain so for many
years, entirely through the cowardice of these
politicians, who became smitten with a great
funk, and were only too pleased to creep into the
same kennel with the reviled Nicholls. Yet
Kyabram is still only the same old spectre made
of a dirty sheet on a stick, with a turnip at the
top end.

Indigestion iNn
Cured by
VITADATIQ
Oxford-street, Lyttleton (N.Z.)
June 10, 1901.
MR. S. A. PALMER.
Dear Sir,—This is to testify to the great benefit I have
received from Webber’s Great Herbal Remedy VITA-
DATIO. I have been a great sufferer for about 13 years
with indigestion and biliousness, and have tried all sorts
of remedies, with only slight relief. After having heard
about the wonderful curative powers of VITADATIO, I
decided to try it, and after using three large bottles I
can honestly say it acted like magic ; I began to feel
relief after taking the first bottle. Before I took it I
sometimes had to have hot flannels and turpentine
applied for 12 hours’ at a time. It is now five months
since I took it, and I have not had any return of the
complaint since. I feel much brighter and in spirits than
I have felt for years. Hoping these few lines will inspire
some fellow-sufferer with hope. You are at liberty to use
this testimonial as you think fit.—l remain yours
truly,
MRS. F. GILLARD.
Witness, her son, Fred. Gillard.

Fresh outbreak by G. Reid :
As I stated in the House in Melbourne the other day,
it was almost disgraceful to compare the anxiety that
was shown to protect various little industries in Mel-
bourne at the expense of the whole community, with the,
in my opinion, unstatesmanlike and wanton disregard of
the sufferings of the settlers of this great State and its
northern neighbor. The Federal Government, under
pressure of the widespread calamities to which I allude,
missed a great opportunity for placing the Federation in
a proper and kindly light before the people of the world.
Of course, I can understand the very few farmers in Vic-
toria, who might derive benefit from high protective
duties on food for cattle and sheep, feeling it rather hard
that they should be deprived of the benefit of the policy
on the rare occasion that it could be of any benefit to
them ; but in the presence of truly national calamities
every consideration of self-interest should give way.
The interesting part is that wild horses won’t
drag from George Reid a single allusion to the
fact that the Governments of “this great State
and its northern neighbor ” receive the fodder
duty revenue, and if they would only agree to hand
it back to the pastoralist then he would be getting
his fodder free. The possible explanation of which
is that if George Reid pointed out that See and
Philp are wholly responsible for the maintenance
of the fodder duties in their States he might help
to get them out of office, but that wouldn’t help
him into office. On the other hand, the persistent
circulation of the lie that the Federal Government
is wholly responsible may get Barton out of office,
and George Reid has the reversion of his job—
unless M Mill an jumps his claim.

“L.M.D.”: I know a permanent-way
man when I see him. He has the sleeper-gait—
three long steps and a short one. The sleepers on
the railway are placed about 3ft. apart, excepting
at the joints of the rails, where two sleepers are
placed within Ift. or 18in. of each other. So
when I see a man coming down the street whose
every fourth step is condensed, I know that man.
Arthur Griffith managed to get his measure
for the abolition of fees in N.S.W. State schools
through the Assembly, despite the covert opposi-
tion of the See Government. The Government atti-
tude was one of wobble. Taught by experience,
Griffith was anxious for a Ministerial pronounce-
ment imfavor of the Bill, in order to get it through
the Council. But See and Perry only wobbled
something extra, and tried to postpone its opera-
tion until 1905, and generally threw cold water on
the idea. Their objection was that revenue could
not be spared at present, and that the time was
not “opportune” for the reform. Griffith’s
friends retorted that no year since 1883 had been
considered “opportune.”

The most astounding figure that has ap-
peared in the witness-box of any Australian court
for years is George Savay, the quarter-caste
Mauritian who did his little towards hanging
Tisler and Mrs. Sangal for the nauseating Dande-
nong (Vic.), murder. The deceased, Sangal, on
his one encounter with Savay, said that a big
dark fellow had come out of the bush and given
him a fright. Savay looked the character. He
appeared in the box as a tall, thin, shambling
fellow, dark, saturnine, beetle-browed and with a
heavy black growth about his jaws. According to
Tisler’s confession, he accosted Savay on the
wharf, with the intimation that he wanted a little
murder done, and there was considerable negotia-
tion on the subject. It isn’t a compliment to a
man’s appearance when other men range up along-
side him casually and ask what he’ll charge for
doing a murder.
Somequestions by King O’Malley, M.H.R.,
whose stupendous hat hasn’t been much in evi-
dence of late: —
Mr. O’Malley: To ask the Honorable the Minister of
Defence—
Whether, as reported in the Age, Major-General Sir
Edward Hutton has obtained the Minister’s approval of
the proposed scheme to establish the Commonwealth
Military Forces on a defensive-offensive basis.
Does the Minister believe that the Commonwealth
would be benefited by offensive operations.
Does the Minister think that in the event of war
between Germany and England, and in the event of
Ecuador, Bolivia, Cuba, and Nicaragua threatening to
assist Germany, Major-General Hutton would despatch
the Australian Army against the nations assisting Ger-
many.
If Germany discovered that the Australian Army was at
s :a, would she not immediately despatch a flying squadron
to shell Melbourne or Sydney.
In the event of Germany despatching a flying squadron
to Australia, would Major-General Hutton be able to
recall the Australian Army at sea by wireless telegraphy,
or would the General have accompanied the army and
also be “at sea.”
A case that promises to provide a crust for
the legal profession started its brief but disastrous
career in Melbourne t’other day. Jones and
Smith —which are good enough aliases —bought
adjacent allotments in a suburb some years back.
Then Jones purchased a ready-made portable
weatherboard house off an embarrassed building
society, and shifted it out to his newly-acquired
land. Unfortunately, the careless house-knacker
planted the building on Smith’s block, and
Jones went ahead and titivated up the house,
and planted a garden, with three trees and two
statuettes, and generally beautified the ‘ ‘ desirable
suburban villa ” —all on Smith’s land. Snath
seems to have been asleep all this time or
temporarily dead. Anyhow, he suddenly woke
up and, without inspecting his property or valuing
the unearned increment thereon, sold it out of
hand to one, Sawbones, M.B. When Jones
called round for the usual rent he was in-
formed that Sawbones had told the tenant
to clear out immediately, as he was coming
to live there himself; also the tenant rounded
on Jones for selling the house over his tenant’s
head, and so turning a respectable citizen out into
a homeless world, in a manner of speaking. Jones
swore freely, and said Sawbones must be mad ;
but a brief, excited inquiry convinced him that if
he wished to continue in possession of his house
he had better get it on his own land in a hurry.
So the house-knacker was requisitioned once
more, but, before he got properly going, Sawbones
arrived and dared him to shift property off his
(Sawbones’) land. Thereupon Jones and Sawbones
argued high and low, and east and west, and were
about to settle matters with the fence-palings
when the Law intervened and intimated that
there was a proper way of conducting such dis-
putes—which means that a desirable weather-
board villa will go in costs. Meanwhile, Smith
seems to be still asleep.
“A friend Told Me.”
A great deal has been written on the subject of
Advice —who are the people best qualified to give
it, and when and how it should be asked, offered,
accepted, rejected, etc. “ Pray, give a poor man a
few coppers,” whined a seedy-looking individual
into the ear of a fat dean, as both stood in St.
Paul’s Churchyard, London, watching the erection
of seats for viewing the ceremony of Queen
Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. “ There is a notice, ”
said the dean, rapping a placard with a scroll of
papers which he carried in his hand, “that
labourers are wanted. Work, my man, work;
don’t beg from people in the streets.” “I asked
you for money,” said the beggar contemptuously,
“not advice.” ’Twas ever thus. Proffered advice
is seldom well received, those best qualified to
give it being generally the last to offer it. And
yet there are occasions when it is the plain duty
of anybody to volunteer the most positive advice —
as, for instance, in the case of one who has a
suffering friend, and knows of some means to
effect his cure. The experience of Mr. C. A.
Bonnett, of 53, Currie-street, Adelaide, S.A., well
illustrates this. “For two years,” writes Mr.
Bonnett, “I suffered continuously from acute
indigestion and constipation. Before meal times
I would feel as hungry as a hunter, but no sooner
would I sit down to table and attempt to swallow
a few mouthfuls than my appetite vanished and I
loathed the very sight or smell of food. Nothing
could be more tantalising ; I was always hungry,
yet unable to eat. Thenther© was the ever-present,
uncomfortable sensation of distension of the stom-
ach. As I became weaker from want of nourish-
ment, my symptoms increased in severity. I tried
many remedies, but got no good from any of them.
Several, indeed, seemed to aggravate my
complaint. I had almost decided to have nothing
more to do with them when, a little over a year
ago, a friend brought me half a bottle of Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup. He told me that he
himself had been cured by it, and strongly advised
me to let it do as much for me. In the end he
persuaded me to take it, and I derived so much
benefit from the half-bottle that it induced me to
take a course of it. It rapidly broke up the
constipation, restored my appetite, and built up
my strength. Within six weeks of the date on
which I took the first dose, Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup had completed my recovery. I
always keep a bottle in the house, for I find an
occasional dose regulates the bowels without pain
or inconvenience, and keeps the organs of digestion
generally in good working order.”

RHEUMATISM.
A Most Wonderful
and Thorough Cure.
Weight increased nearly Two Stone in less than Two Months.
Mr. A. AUKLING, AN OLD RESIDENT OP RANDWICK, HAS WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING :
Messrs. FISHER and CO. Randwick, September 4, 1902.
Dear Sirs, —Two months ago I was cured of Rheumatism by KILLRHEU. I still take it, and wish to
let you know that from the time of commencing to take KILLRHEU my weight has increased one stone and
eleven pounds.
Previously, because of pain and want of sleep, my system was completely run down, and I was very
thin, hut KILLRHEU has thoroughly purified my blood, which is now rich and strong ; my.digestive organs
are thoroughly renovated. You have my sincere' gratitude, and may publish this for the good of others.
Old and young should take KILLRHEU, for I consider it the greatest of family medicines.
Subscribed and declared at Randwick, this
fourth day of September, one thousand nine
hundred and two, before me,
WILLIAM 0. COOMBES,
Justice of the Peace.
Nearly two months previous to the above letter, Mr. Ackling wrote stating that he suffered terribly,
but was thoroughly cured of Rheumatism after taking only one bottleful. He still takes it regularly for the
of his general good health, and says KILLRHEU keeps him in magnificent condition.
It Cares me and I recommend it to yon, and so on goes the Great KILLRHEU.

The State-legalised polygamy system in-
stituted in British S’Africa since “the triumph
of the New Testament ” is to be extended, as a
result of British diplomacy, to Portuguese
S’Africa. What does Exeter Hall say to this
deliberate licensing of “immorality” among the
natives as a means to beguile them to labor in the
mines ?
“Dentist”: Another ring—more work.
“Mr. Slayer,” announces the maid, and with a
sigh I go down. “ Good eve-r-ning,” says my
caller, and I mentally sum him up as a country
patient for extractions, and perhaps a plate. He
apologises for troubling me, and comes to business.
“ Look ’ere,” he says, “I’m a brother dentist, and
I does a bit of hawking—patent-medicines, boots
and shoes, tea, and sich like, but wot pays me
best is the teeth-drorin’, ss. a time, money down
before I start. And wot I come over ’ere for was
to ask your advice.” Then digging down into the
recesses of his claw-hammer coat he produces a
bundle wrapped in a dirty rag. “ Look ’ere,” he
says, “wot do you think of them?” “Them”
was a pair of ’ceps, old and somewhat rusty, pro-
bably a ship’s set bought at a second-hand dealer’s.
I remark that they are somewhat old-fashioned,
but would suffice for the upper teeth —and ask to
see his “lower” instruments. “Lowers!” he
exclaims. “Well, I’m blest,” and slapping his
leg he confides to me that he always had broken
the lower teeth—that was his trouble, and if I’d
explain to him how to extract the lower molars he
would be most grateful. I invite him to my
surgery and display my lower forceps, and, for
the sake of humanity, instruct him in the way of
using them. I trust that in consequence someone
will be less murderously treated.


A REAL PICK-ME-UP.—“ Talk about cham-
pagne,” said Byron, “there is nothing which

aperient.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The liberality of Ikey Mo over the two Cups is
truly painful. Anything with a live chance 200 to 1 the
double ! Stiff goods (also halt, lame and dead) 500 to 1.
The correct odds are more like an average of 16,000 to 1.
If only Wakeful, Abundance, and Patronage were in the
2-miie event the odds should be better than they are.

Famous stallion, Lochiel, among most noted
Australian nags, died at Mr. Jas. Thompson’s stud, Ryl-
stone (N.S.W.), t’other day. Lochiel was got 20 years
ago in England, and bred in M.L. through Mr. G. O.
Stead importing his dam. He was by Prince Charlie
(winner of the Two Thousand Guineas) from Nelly Moore
(imp.), by Voltigeur from Pickle, by Dundee from Change-
able, by Weatherbit. In 25 starts he was placed 16
times. M.L. and Auckland Cups, A.R.O. Newmarket,
Auckland Plate, Y.R.C. Newmarket, Australian Cup, and
Autumn Handicap were his principal wins. He was even
more successful at the stud. A very large number of
winners owe their origin to him, among them Amiable,
Loch Marie, Paul Pry, Old Clo, The Chevalier, Strathroj',
Le Var, Survivor, Cremona, Shaughraun, Dewey, Locha-
ber, Argyle and Cherry. Last season Lochiel’s get secured
£BOOO in stakes. In 1900-’Ol, Lochiel’s progeny lifted their
sire away above all others through winning 120 races, worth
over £12,668. Season before they did even better, for 37
of them won 110 races, prize-money of which totalled
£16,137. In ’9B-’99 Lochiel’s progeny scooped £12,277.
They closed on £15,222 in ’97-’93, and, in ’96-’97, £7122.
When Lochiel finished racing, late Tommy Hales bought
him, but he didn’t do well till secured by Mr. Thompson.
* * • *
Punters should be convinced now that once
much-boomed nag Horace isn’t the marvel generally
thought, and possibly he never was. In Moorefield Han-
dicap, Saturdaj r , he carried a pile of owner Wooton’s coin,
and lined up first choice (2 to 1), opposed to a poor field,
but ran a regular commoner. His backers have dropped
big sums. Though racing through four seasons, he has
only finished in front of everything else once. Horace
was heavily supported for a Melbourne Cup. They’re
trying him over jumps now, but he’ll have to come on a
deal in pace to be a success even at that game.
* * * *
Future probabilities in Medallion fillies, Saida
and Oarwee, appropriated races at Moorefield Saturday.
Former was at eights, and beat scorching favorite, Hello
(6 to 4), with something in hand, while Purser (5 to 1) filled
third place. Saida was bred at Tocal (N.S.W.) by Mr.
F. S. Reynolds from Algerine, dam of Massinissa, Barbar-
ossa and Numidia. Algerine’s sire was Hawthornden and,
dam, Algeria (imp.) by Blinkhoolie. Saida is handsome
and that she owns pace and bottom is undeniable. Carwee
annexed Stewards’ Mile (wherein soft-footed Crosslake was
favorite at threes) from Barnindi but only through sheer
grit and stamina. The dam (Red and Black, imp.) of Aus-
tralian Colors is also Oarwee’s.
* * * *
Set books on Caulfield and Melbourne Cups are
not so plentiful or extensive as in former years, and will
probably die out altogether, as Mo grows more and more
chary. One big penciller tells that he began last year by
laying 1000 to 5 against Revenue and then 100’s to 1,
when, if he had waited till the day of the race, a £lOOO
book would have seen him get over £5OO Revenue and
more than £2OO San Fran. As it was the first “ thou ”in
his set book brought only £55 through the same two.
When Lancaster started a 3 to 1 favorite in Clean Sweep’s
Cud, two years ago, three firms of Sydney books were
“ going up ” for £lO,OOO against him, laid at an average
of 20 to L s
* * » »
Indications are that, provided everything goes
right with Wakeful, she’ll line up as hot a pot for Mel-
bourne Cup as her stable-chum Revenue did last year.
The public are crazy on Wakeful after her recent Rand-
wick achievements, but Mo, wary always, knows this and
isn’t likely to risk much until the odds cramp a bit more
so that he may get his money in at the shortest possible
figure. Another the raucous-voiced are very loth to lay
is Patronage, who only has to continue well to get loads
of support. As far as can be gathered, and despite fre-
quent daily press pars to the contrary, it is almost good
enough to bet that The Persian is the only nag legiti-
mately invested upon so far.
* * » *
Another discovery of tinkering with scales was
made during recent demolition of Moorefield racecourse
buildings, when revelations were pretty well akin to
those of Eagle Farm, Brisbane, some weeks ago. A
couple of boards had been removed from the floor of the
secretary’s room, so that the basement could be reached.
A slit between flooring boards under the official scales
allowed the insertion of a hook, one end of which was
attached to one of the machine’s beams, while a bag of
shot weighing in excess of a stone was suspended from
the other end. Effect of this would be that a nag could
get through successfully humping close on 2st. less than
the weight allotted him. The thing had evidently been
long in use. The bag holding the shot had almost rotted,
but the iron hook, which probably replaced another one,
was absolutely free from rust. There were indications,
too, that the accidental shifting of the scales had been
followed. Here, surely, is the elucidation of why some
nags run better on one particular course than others,
even though they may, according to the book, be hump-
ing crushing loads. This suggests the possibility that
the same game is being tried at other places.
• * * *
First sensation of this year’s Caulfield and
Melbourne Cups betting was sprung in the scratching
last week of imported nag Simile for both events. Some
big punters invested largely on him through “ something
strong ” alleged to have been seen in the Metrop. running,
and, though the “stable” insisted that none of its
coin had been placed, bets of 1000 to 90 were still taken,
till at last 10 to 1 was not easily procurable, and at that
some hundreds were laid the day preceding Simile’s
elimination. All this, too, with the fact before those who
trouble about such matters that Simile (6yrs. old) had
never won a race, and was only placed once—third in the
A.J.O. Spring Maiden Stakes. Nice endorsement, truly,
for a Caulfield Cup favorite. He ran four times in
England as a 2yr.-old, and was so little valued there that
the N.S.W. owner, who races as “Mr. Baron,” got him
for 100 guineas ; but absence of form in England shouldn’t
necessarily tell against the same nag in Australia, for Sir
Foote (who ranked among the infirm when “ down
under ’’) and Positano came on great guns in Australia.
» » « »
Hamilton (Vic.) Spectator swears to a remark-
able jump by a 14.1 pony, 3yrs. old, at Penshurst. It was
run into a cow-yard, enclosed by a cemented wall 6ft. 4in.
high, for the purpose of being caught and handled. The
breaker-in gave the pony a flick on the hind-quarter, and
was flabbergasted to see it make one bound at the wall
and clear it like a bird, touching nothing. Distance from
take-off to place of landing was found to be 26ft. 6in.
Pony’s breeding is by Freetrader—Tam-o’-Shanter dam.

Three-year-old filly Fungus shaped fetchingly
at Moorefield, Saturday. Starting favorite in first and
last (Kogarah Stakes and Welter Handicap) she appro-
priated both easily, giving nothing else a hope. Mr.
“Sam” Hordern bred her by Haut Brion, from Blue
Mould (imp.), by Coeruleus, from Staff of Life, by Brown
Bread from Lady Highthorn. Fungus’ future is worth
watching with a view to profit.

Indications are that in the Wheat State horse-
racing is a dying sport. Saturday last, at Adelaide
Tatt.’s Club meet, attendance was o i’v fair, and “ tote ”
results showed a shortage of £1292 a,jmpared with last
year’s transactions.
* * * *
Confidently hoped that a measure before South
Aus. Parliament will completely annihilate shop Moses
in that State. The bill provides that proof of the re-
ceiving of “ any money or thing” by Mo. or his agents
“ which raises a reasonable suspicion that it was in con-
travention of the Act shall be deemed prima facie
evidence of the commission of the offence.” Police are
given power to, on a warrant, enter a place where it is
suspected unlawful gaming is going on. Maxim penalty
is £2OO. If the bejewelled one of Adelaide is half as wily
as his brother of Sydney he'll laugh at this latest effort to
wipe him out. That proof of the receiving of any money
or thing is the difficulty everywhere. Remaining in
possession for three days won’t help the case the least
little bit, for what isn’t found the first hour or two won’t
be discovered the next month. There’ll be nothing of an
incriminating nature lying round loose.

“A premature leaning to cussedness ” was dis-

N.S.W. Rugby Football Association cleared,
roughly, £lOOO last season, and, with all this money in
hand, it is up to the Association to start a “ Footballers’
Relief and Accident Department,” wherefrom players
who received injuries during the raking in of the Associa-
tion s profits might be provided for. Every' season a
considerable number of men are mangled, and become
drugs in the matrimonial market through having their
personal beauty removed. The Association might make
a start by providing for the wounded and burying the
dead ; it could leave the question of compensation for
loss of beauty to a future time when the profits will
have accumulated some more. The people who provide
the playing grounds are paid, the people who do the
printing, and practically everything to which no danger
is attached, have a share of the takings, but the players—
themen who take their lives on the toes of their'boots
and go down into the scrum, and look death in the eves a
score of times during every game—receive nothing when
the inevitable wreck happens.

In a learned cricket article the Saturday
Review compares the Australian and English teams, and,
like most English papers, gives the palm to England.
England s eleven are better men except on the one
trifling point that they don’t win. The S.R. allows that
Australia should supply four men (Trumper, Noble, Hill,

witnessed recently in England when “ old man ” W. G.

for London County and Hampshire respectively, and
Spofforth had the satisfaction of clean bowling Grace after
he had notched 21 runs. Spofforth was one of the best
bowlers in his day, but he is rapidly settling down to the
weary toothless state of mumbling about past glories.

How is this for the champion mixed metaphor ?
It is written quite seriously in the London Sporting and
Dramatic, of July 12 :—“The colonials won the third test,
so that, on the series of five games, they became, in the
language of the golfer, one up with two to play. Eng-
land, of course, may yet secure the rubber, by winning the
two remaining matches ; but this one defeat at a critical
time has driven far away the regained laurels which
appeared to be nestling in the offing.”

W. G. Grace was well into the fifties before he
started to reduce his protuberant stummick on the San-
dow system. He is now a more cricketable W.G. than
he has been for many years.

Snip ”: The claim for best all-round per-

fully towards the close, but his bowling fell off, while
Armstrong proved a “find” in the latter department.
He took 81 wickets, and put up one or two startling per-
formances. His batting was peculiar, being mostly com-
posed of small scores, only nine times out of 51 innings
did he make more than his final average.
“ 8.8.’’ : A feature of the English season just
concluded is the position which A. Shrewsbury has held
in the first-class batting average list. On August 4 his
figures were 26 innings, 1011 runs, average 50.55 ; and, old
man as he is, he put up the best performance of' his
cricket career a week previous to the compilation of the
averages when he scored 101 and 127 not out in a countv
match, Notts, v. Gloucester.

‘Ton”: Anent Prof. Miller’s challenge to
Sandow. Writer thinks the Australian mass of brawn
might easily drop the sword and foil conditions and stop
at dumbbell lifting, ’rastling and boxing, and then have
healthy prospects of success—old and all though he be.
When in America Sandow claimed that he could go
through the cleverest fist-fighters extant, but, though
Corbett, Fitzsimmons, Jeffries and co. were willing the
strongman didn’t rush them. Miller has heaps of'top-
rung, weight-hoisting feats to his credit. He raised two
14ijlbs. bolls 5000 consecutive times, lifted a 1961b5. weight
with two h inds to the shoulder, then, without jerlT or
jump, sent it straight to full arm’s length. Elevated with
one hand a lOOlbs. bell 20 times, 2001bs. once, 1651b5.
twice, and 1501bs. three times. Two bolls, aggregating
2501b5., were raised—one in each hand—and once he
lifted 15501b5. of solid iron. Best thing list of records
credits Sandow with is raising a 2501b5. bar bell with both
hands from floor to arm’s length above head February
last year. At this game Sandow might win, but Miller
(an accomplished ’rastler and capable boxer) would cer-
tainly get t’other two.
* * * *
German .strong man Pagel has posted from
Brisbane money for a weight-lifting struggle with Sandow.
. who is only about 26 years of age, would £ive the
visitor a close call, if the pair could be matched. Four
years since, when unable to speak a word of English
and working at a restaurant in Macquarie-place
(Sydney), he shaped extraordinarily well with crushing
weights, and then he was only a beginner. Months
before showing in public, Pagel, with one sweep of the
right hand, raised 1891 b. from floor to full stretch of arm
above the head, and subsequently lifted 2051 b. t o shoulder
with both hands, and thence with one hand to arm’s
length above. These weights were put on the scales im-
mediately before the feats and afterwards by o nlooker3
and found correct to the oz. Since then, Pagel has
matured and improved considerably.
“Sceptic”: Sandow says muscular develop-
ment is not so much a gift of nature as a matter of culti-
vation. Lengthy athletic experience has brought this
scribe in contact with men owning exceptional muscular
development who have rarely handled dumbbells, or done
anything out of the ordinary to improve their physiques.
The world’s acknowledged strongest man, Canadian Louis
Cyr, who knows none of the tricks of the trade, and, con-
sequently, doesn’t “take” in a show turn, got his mar-
vellous powers naturally, and has never troubled much
about improving them. At legitimate weight-lifting he
can give the Samsons and the Sandows of the music hall
and circus world big hunks of weight in and then win.
Three years ago he raised 2651 b. with one hand from
ground to shoulder, and then pushed it up from shoulder
to arm’s length above. He lifted 4401 b. (two bells attached
to a cord about 3ft. long) with one finger, and once
straightened his right arm (holding a horizon-
tally from the shoulder, and brought it back again. In
’96 he lifted 1897|1b. clear of the floor without artificial
aid of any kind, and in ’BB raised 35361 b. of pig-iron,
pushing with back, arms, and legs until a plank holding
the load was shifted clear of trestles. In ’95 he lifted
43001 b. of live weight in a similar fashion.
• * • *
“ Alex. M.”: A special feature in Strong-Man
Sandow’s physique is the splendid development of the
portentously-named muscle, obliquis externux abdominis.
It is these muscles (one on each side) that present the
ridge just above the groin so observable in classic statues
of men—statues also notable for the three muscle-
ridges across the abdomen higher up— due to develop-
ment of the rectus abdominis. In ordinary life these
abdominal muscles are very little used, and Sandow
claims that a proper cultivation of them is not only very
beneficial in other ways, but furnishes an absolute
safeguard against hernia.

“E.D.”: In support of your statement that
the big unskilled man has no “ earthly ” with the skilled
little man when they get together with or without the
gloves—l was always a doubter until a few Sundays ago
when I happened to witness a “ go,” down Ooogee way,
between a determined 12st. footballer, who knew nothing,
and a scarcely lOst. unconditioned, straw-hatted, clerky
weed who did. The campaign lasted nearly 20 minutes,
was fight all the way, and the heavy man never had a
ghost of a chance any part of the journey. Would never
have gone that length had not ten-stoner knocked his
hard-hitting right hand up during first few minutes.
Twelve-stoner’s face was a mass of door-knobs at the end.
Ten-stoner had a bruised ear and a slightly puffed lip.

“Via”: All very fine for “Werrimee” (8.,
20/9/’O2) to say “watch your opponent’s eye” when
scrapping, and see where he’s going to hit. What about
night time, when a lot of willing “ goes ” take place !
Also, what if your foe is cock-eyed or swivel-eyed, or has
a whirling or revolving optic ? ' In my salad days I tried a
cross-eyed chap—and resumed work about four days
after. No wonder Fitzsimmons won a lot of fights.

Wm. Thompson, old-time famous pugilist under
the name of “ Bendigo,” has a fine monument (a sculp-
tured lion, couchant) in the cemetery at Nottingham,
England, his birthplace. After his retirement from the
ring, he became a dissenting minister, and died Aug.,
’BO, aged 69. The inscription runs —
In life always brave, fighting like a lion ;
In death like a lamb, tranquil in Zion.

A brisk mill of 15 rounds happened the other
Wednesday in Fitzroy Athletic Club’s Hall (Vic.), when
Ed. Williams, a long, lithe youngster from Port Melb.,
met a comparative veteran, Fred. Smith, both within
light-weight limit. The match was a striking proof of
what can be done with a straight left if it is long enough,
and Williams’ left is phenomenally long. He simply poked
Smith off throughout 16 rounds, and Smith battled wildly
With the intervening atmosphere. Williams, who looks
like developing into a spanking middleweight, won with
a heap of points to spare, on the word of Micko Walsh,
referee.

Evidence of what money there is in promoting
boxing matches between first-class men comes through
N.S.W. welterweight “Snowy” Sturgeon’s published
challenge to the world. He’ll fight any man, 10.7 or
under, for £5OO a side, and a Sydney club offers £5OO to
the winner, which, atop of possibilities in bets (that may
reach a thousand) at the ringside or beforehand, should
lure some enterprising ’Murkan fighter Australiawards.
This continent is indeed a bruiser’s paradise. Third-
raters ridicule anything less than £lOO as inducement ;
while second-class men refuse to think of such a paltry
offer as £l5O. One (last week) said, in response to a ques-
tion from the management of Sydney’s toney boxing-club,
that nothing under £250 would fetch him. Meanwhile,
always-fighting Jack M’Gowan, the daddy of the heap, is
coming over shortly to contend for £l5O.
• * m *
Present - time Australian referees, with their
craze for going between contending pugs every time they
get close, are doing away with the best part of the game,
the infighting. Public, too, have caught the taint, and when
one is holding and t’other punches, with both arms free,
they howl and hoot at him for “ unfair ” work, which isn’t
in the remotest degree unfair at all. The intention of
allowing this is to prevent clinching, nowadays so
frequent as to pall upon one. It’s no fault of the man
with both “mauleys” at liberty that his opponent
chooses to cuddle instead of fight. Neither, however,
may hold with one arm and thump with the other, as
this practice gives a strong man a big pull over a weaker,
but perhaps very much cleverer, adversary, in that when
at close quarters the more powerful fighter might hold
his adversary and punch away for seconds at a stretch—
the “ head in chancery ” of the P.R.

Recently announced home-coming to Melbourne
of once champion middleweight of Australia, Dan
Creedon, has drawn a heap of challenges. “ Snowy ”
Sturgeon, “ Tut ” Ryan, “ Jim ” Scanlan, and the winner
(M’Coll or Doherty) of the heavyweight supremacy
struggle next month are offered as prospective op-
ponents. A match with Sturgeon will ensure a £2OO
purse, while hitching on to Scanlan means that Dan can
have the same amount, and as much on the side as he
likes, for Scanlan has a Newcastle friend who’ll stand
lumps of coin for him. “Tut” Ryan modestly suggests
a £25 bet, and reminds Creedon that twice ere he went
to the U.S. they fought draws —one of 30, and t’other of
8 rounds. This isn’t the sort of thing to parade before
the public if a good house is wanted, for Australia’s
history of bruiserdom bristles with “ arranged affairs ”
that were all draws. It’s certain, however, that the man
who gets the match will have a softer time now with
Creedon than when Australia saw him in the ring last.
Since then he has won the championship of England,
fought for the middle premiership of the world, been the
victor in many big battles, and, latterly, fallen off con-
siderably. The last year or so of his career in America
saw several reverses come his way.

Cabled that Australasian champion swimmer
boy, Dick Cavill, snatched the swimming world’s record
last week in England, by covering 100yds. in 58 3-ssec.
Sensation caused by Fred Lane’s 60sec. for the same
journey, a couple of months before, had barely passed
when Cavill’s hair-raising feat occurred. Some Sydney
swimming authorities doubt the genuineness of the
performance. Why ? The cable doesn’t even hint at the
time being open to question. It’s any odds on, that
special arrangements were made for this particular swim,
as Cavill was to have left homeward Saturday last.
Then, again, his showing in the 100 and 220 (both of
which saw Lane win from him by the touch only) sug-
gested the possibility of his being able to do even better
than Lane’s records, for each time Cavill left his effort
till the last few yards, and shaped in such a way as to
convince that had he come earlier he would certainly
have scored, and in quicker time than the figures then
created. Cavill’s half-mile in August was remarkable,
but his latest hundred tops it.
* * » *
Dick Cavill, in his farewell flutter at
Liverpool, beating ’Ome premier Billington, made
fresh world’s figures (3.34 3-5) for 300yds. His
previous best for the journey in Australia was
3.40 4-5, accomplished at Sydney Domain Baths
last year. Same day, Fred Lane covered 150.yds. in 1.36
3-5, which exactly equals his world’s record, set up at
Bolton (Eng.) on the 18th ult. Pity of it that English
distance champ. Jarvis, who beat Dick in the mile—three
days after the lad had landed —and in the long distance
event (5m.), a few weeks later, refrained from competing,
probably scenting danger. Cavili’s half and quarter mile
figures make it appear certain that Jarvis would have
gone under in either or both those events.

’Murkan bikist Floyd A. M'Farland, expected
in Australia Nov. next, ranks among the world’s fore-
front all-rounders, having won from a sprint to a six-day’s
grind. M‘F. has exceptional physique, and is just 25
years old. Two years back, a 16hr. event fell to him,
and, together with Cooper and Banker, he secured the
Nation’s Chamionship for America from reps of all coun-
tries. Frenchman Huret went down to M'Farland in a
15 miles pace struggle. Subsequently, he proved equal
to marvellous pace-follower Michael. Later, M’Farland
and Elkes won the big ’Murkan six-days team race, at
New York. Crossing the Atlantic once more, Frenchman
Jacquelin went under to M‘F. in a 15 miles paced race.
As Mac.’s form is still up to top mark, on reputation,
there’s no one in Australia can approach him. But repu-
tation’s have a knack of going bung in this country.

The prospects of a professional cycling boom in
Sydney are not at all rosy. Bike-racing committed
suicide just in its prime by an overdose of inside-cronk-
business. The back-markers were usually influential,
and when a back-marker was concerned in any scandal
the authorities seemed to get suddenly paralysed. A few
more cases of payment by the back-markers to those in
front not to try will nip the nascent boom in the bud.
N.S.W. O.A. proposes to import some Yankee talent,
including “ Major” Taylor, the dusky flier who recently
gave our own Bill Martin 100 yd. in the mile in U.S.A.
The ink-blot gentleman should be a big draw at the pro-
posed carnival in November. Zimmerman, when im-
ported, drew 30,000 to Sydney Cricket Ground, and
Taylor, it is said, can give Zim. a discount of somewhere
about 100 yards in the mile.

There is nothing that will test the effectiveness
and reliability of a motor cycle like an all-day run, and
with this object in view Mr. H. B. James, of the Dunlop
Tyre Co., Melbourne, intends shortly making a 24 hours’
ride on the Western District roads. The course most
likely to be selected will be from Melbourne to Hamilton
(via the Western District), then down to Warrnambool.
After leaving the seaside township, a detour will be made
up to Mortlake, thence back to Melbourne via Terang and
Geelong, about 450 miles.

Ten miles Victorian cross country supremacy
was contested by 125 lathy-liinbed athletes with here and
there a sturdily-constructed one who looked as if he had
strayed from somewhere. Last year’s winner, J. A. Still-
well, scored again with 100 yards to the good—a lot of
which he gained through crossing in front of a passing
train while others had to wait. Time (61m. 4sec.) is just
lmin. better that Stillwell’s last year and he is the first in
the race’s history to score twice successively. O. E.
Herbert has three wins to his credit, also the fastest time
—s9m. ss. Melbourne Harriers, absolutely untipped,
gathered in the club supremacy mainly through novices
Niquet, Blake an.d Davies, the first of whom made a
remarkable initial appearance by running second.

The health of Peacock of the Laugh seems
to have utterly collapsed at last. : For years he
has been the wonder of politicians and city men.
He never had a day’s real illness, and used to
work pretty well all round the clock. When in
Ministerial office he has always had a hard row to
hoe, and yet he kept up his big legal manager’s
business in the city and at Ballarat. In the last
two years he has aged a great deal. He became
very grey, and his face took on an unhealthy ashen
appearance. Never a clear speaker, his utterances
in and out of Parliament have become more in-
volved and clumsy, and less forcible. Peacock has
always been a good feeder, a small drinker and an
incessant smoker.
Few more shabby things have ever been
done in journalism than the Melb. Age’s treat-
ment of the suicide of Martindale, ex-Mayor of
Clunes. Martindale was a leading member of the
local “Reform ” movement, and at one time was
mentioned as an opponent of Opposition leader
Peacock for the Clunes and Allendale seat. He
was a genuinely religious man, and trying to
make politics and religion run on the same
set of rails caused a temporary derange-
ment of the brain. The result was that
early one morning he went out quietly to
his stable and blew his head off. During the
campaign Peacock, referring to a member of the
Ministry who had been saying nasty things
about him, remarked that there were some
people who went about preaching on Sundays
and telling lies all the rest of the week. Seizing
on this remark, the Age immediately connected
it with Martindale’s death. The object, of course,
was to create a bad impression against Peacock,
who at the time was lying dangerously ill him-
self. Peacock and Martindale had always been
strong friends, and Peacock has over and over
again been heard in public to say that the ex-
Mayor was a fine stamp of man.
Taking the Tide.
The tide in the affairs of all men, and women
likewise, if taken at the flood, not only leads to
fortune, but blessings without which fortune is of
little good. Take the case of Mrs. Kilner, a lady
who resides at 15 Sydney-road, Moreland,
Melbourne. She relates how she took the tide at
the flood, and her story is a remarkably vivid
illustration of two pictures which portray in each
the most wretched and the happiest states of
existence. She writes:—A few weeks ago I had
occasion to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for
influenza, whicli was beginning to take a firm hold
on me. They were recommended to me for that
terrible complaint. Previous to getting influenza
for a long time I had been listless, languid, and
quite unable to do my work, owing, I believe, to
physical changes. I can only describe my life as
a most wretched one owing to this condition.
Well, the pills not only cured me of influenza,
but I was delighted to find that I was cured of the
depressed, run-down feeling, and I became bright
and energetic ; in fact, I am far and away better
than I have felt for years, and I take pleasure in
recommending the pills to all who need a medicine
for such complaints.” Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are a perfect blood purifier, and a positive
cure for biliousness, indigestion, constipation,
headaches, sallow complexion, liver and kidney
troubles, piles, pimples, boils and blotches, and
for female ailments. Sold by chemists and store-
keepers, Is l|d per bottle, or six bottles 6s. 6d.

The coupon industry and Victoria’s com-
plete abolition thereof upset all the traditions of
the large, fleshy men whose gospel is Thrift.
Firstly, it was a case of the supply creating the
demand, which is the reverse of all economic
traditions ; and, secondly, Victoria, by legislation,
actually abolished the whole industry, which was
undoubtedly a “ gross interference with the liberty
of the subject” and an unwarrantable monkeying
with the “ natural law of supply and demand.”
And yet no one has arisen to explain that
Victoria’s alleged depression is due to this foolish
experimental tinkering with immutable laws.
A Victorian pressman on Premier Irvine :
Iceberg Irvine has achieved a record for political dis-
honesty among all the Victorian Premiers that have ever
been. His policy speech at Nhill during the election
campaign reeked with chicanery and miserable deceits.
He strove, with all the meanest artifices of the
lawyer mind, to set the general public against the public
servants. At no time in the progress of the present agi-
tation in Victoria has Iceberg Irvine put the straight
question of whether his proposals to cut down the salaries
of the bulk of the public service are equitable or honest.
He has simply asked the general public that cast the
bigger vote to help him rob the public servants who
cast the smaller vote. His appeal to the people on
this occasion is like asking a person condemned to
pay a fine of £lOOO whether he will find the
money himself, or whether he will give the magistrate
a power of attorney to steal it from someone else. The
dishonest general public, by pressure on its representa-
tives, got into debt, and instead of asking that general
public to foot the bill Irvine asked that same general
public to give him authority to take the necessary cash
from the pockets of the public servants. Naturally a
dishonest general public was glad to discover a man dis-
honest enough to put such an option before it. Although
Irvine admits the amount of money that it is possible for
him to steal from the public servants is not sufficient to
meet the public’s obligations he is careful not to say how
he purposes raising the remainder of the required funds.
The newspapers slobber over Irvine as a great leader.
Well, he is the sort of strong leader who, although be-
lieving that a land-tax is the best and most scientific
means of straightening out Victoria’s financial muddle,
cuts down the public servants because the people he is
said to lead order him to do so. He is thenort of strong
leader who cringes to the Collins-street newspapers, and
allows men like G. D. Meudell, G. W. S. Dean, a tinpot
political agent, and J. M. Gillespie, well remembered in
boom circles, to come up to his’.Cabinet room and dictate
to him, not only the policy of the country, but what
candidates the Ministry shali support in order to carry
out that policy.
Piles—Purgatory.
Piles—a short word—but embodies a big mean-
ing, and much misery. Many sufferers have
found it spelt Purgatory until they dropped across
the never-failing remedy in Bile Beans for
Biliousness. Mr. J. T. Wilson, a general carrier,
of Howell-street, Albury, N.S.W., had such an
experience. He says:—“l take this opportunity
of informing you of the benefit I have derived by
using your well-known medicine. For a number
of years, I suffered untold agony from Piles,
sometimes losing two or three weeks’ work at a
time. I spent pounds upon pounds for doctors’
treatment. They all advised me to have them
cut out, but I could not accept the idea of being
operated upon. One of my children picked up
one of your pamphlets, which I carefully read,
and then I got a box, tried them, and felt great
benefit. I continued with a couple of boxes, and
I am thankful to say I am now a different man.
I keep them in the house and occasionally take a
dose, which keeps me alright. I take pleasure
in recommending them to anyone I hear of
suffering from piles. I can safely say there is no
medicine like Bile Beans for that distressing
complaint.” By purifying the blood, and stim-
ulating the liver, stomach and digestive organs
to proper action, Bile Beans are an undoubted
specific for biliousness, indigestion, constipation,
piles, bad blood, pimples and skin eruptions,
debility, nervousness, spring and all change-of-
season ailments, &c. Bile Beans are obtainable
from chemists and storekeepers generally, prices

Read the Words
If You Please, Miss, Give Me Heaven.
“ Papa, I’m so sad and lonely,”
Sobbed a tearful little child ;
“ Since dear mamma’s gone to Heaven,
Papa, darling, you’ve not smiled.
I will speak to her and tell her
That we want her to come home;
Just you listen, and I’ll call her
Through the telephone :
Chorus—
“ If you please, Miss, give me Heaven—for my Mamma’s
there;
You can find her with the angels on the golden stair.
She’ll be glad it’s me who’s speaking—call her, won’t you,
please,
For I want to surely tell her we’re so lonely here.”
When the girl received this message,
Coming o’er the telephone,
How her heart thrilled in that moment,
And the wires seemed to moan ;
“ I will answer, just to please her :
‘ Yes, dear heart, I’ll soon come home.’ ”
“ Kiss me, Mamma, kiss your darling,
Through the telephone.”
Chorus —“ If you please, Miss,” etc.

VARICOCELE,
PREVENT PARALYSIS,
And Restore the
NERVOUS SYSTEM.
Every man who has Varicocele recognises,
by evidences which are unmistakable, that
he is physically and mentally below par. It
is impossible that the self-generated toxins,
formed in the sluggish blood currents of
neglected Varicocele, should be absorbed
into nerve matter without producing morbid
conditions that affect the entire organism.
Varicocele is unquestionably the cause
of thousands of business and social failures,
because it strikes at the very seat and centre
of physical and mental power—the nervous
system.
My treatment not only cures the Vari-
cocele, but gives back strength of body
and brain. It gives to a man the reserve
power that is the prerequisite of all success.
I seek cases where all else has failed.
Young, middle-aged, and old men can
recover the same degree of health,
strength, and energy experienced in
former years by consulting

The war correspondent of Wimmera Star
(Vic,) describes a football match :
The umpire bounced the ball. M‘Gee collared it
and causrht Murphv in the ribs, Murphy in falling punched
the ball and it shot some 20 yards out. Sanderson
picked it up and was promptly hurled over by his burly
opponent. Clinging to the ball, however he rolled over
righted himself, and took his kick. Loud cheers from the
spectators. The umpire whistled and bounced the ball.
Bad language from Sanderson, who rightly judged his
burster and effort had been wasted. Scrimmage in front
(ha goal. Centre man, 16st 3lbs, comes down to stop the
dirtv work. Umpire whistles and bounces the ball. They
fall on it. Whistle again. Umpire throws it in the air
Punched simultaneously by six leg-o’-mutton fists, it spins
away out to Murphy who passes it on—and runs after it.
Free kick to Murphy ! Offender wants to know if the
flamin’ umpire’s been squared. Offender’s five brothers
crowd round him. Settled amongst them that umpire
has been got at by the opposing team. Furious rushes
bv the six. Free kicks in plenty. Murphy carried off the
field—a rib broken. Blood showing on faces and hands
of players. Umpire turning whiter than his flannels.
Uproar like that heard in chaos by the spirits seven
times damned. Crowd surges on the ground. Umpire
bounces the ball. It is rushed away. He makes a sign
to friend holding horse. The next free kick will be his
last It is nearly quarter time and agricultural sarcasms,
light as the feet of a Clydesdale, coupled with dire threats
of dealing with the umpire are circlmg the ground.
Weston is thrown by one of the six. Whistle. wh t
for ?—Blasphemy. Umpire is close to the boundary. A
hairy monster is running at him He takes a light run
jumps on his horse. “ Free kick to Weston and with
his friend gallops away. I stood on the hill and saw the
rest They fought and had lunch, fought some more, and
when they couldn’t fight any longer, argued till sundown.
There is humor in the agriculturist. You should hear
his expressions of utter contempt for rules, and note
the highly flavored reflections that the son of the mould-
board makes on u that cow of an umpire.

A Champion Athlete
PAYS THE
Penalty for Continuous Training
And Finds a Welcome Antidote-
The Case of Mr. S. MAHALM.
(FOR THE LEICHHARDT “ STANDARD.”)
To judge from the numerous successes i
all kinds of sport which have been placed
to the credit of Australians it appears that,
as a people, we possess the necessary
stamina and skill required to excel in various
departments of athletics; but, as Mr.
Samuel Mahalm, of Augustus street, Leich-
hardt, told our reporter, it is quite possible
to overtax one’s constitution, and then
trouble ensues.
‘‘ In your palmy days as an athlete you
did not think that so much training and
racing was likely to do you harm, I
suppose 1 ” remarked a Standard reporter.
“ I did not give it a thought, to tell you
the truth,” replied Mr. Mahalm. “I was
too enthusiastic in matters of sport to
trouble about the future, but now that I am
all right again I do not regret having in-
dulged in exercise so heavily.”
“ It was in rowing that you principally
excel'ed, was it not ? ”
>'l, yes; I did meet with a fair
auiuunu of success in that line, as I won the
champion sculls for youths under 21 three
years in succession, and was pitted against
some of the old-time champions besides. In
running, rowing, and sailing I won twenty
races out of twenty-seven starts, so I have
not much to complain about in that respect,
although, when my health broke down, I
thought the game was not worth the candle,
as the saying goes. It is an awful strain on
one’s system to keep at such heavy work
continuously, and when I got very ill I
considered that my success was dearly
boug t.”
“Wnatwas the first sign you had that
vnur health was breaking down ?”
< M„-,.r, nsn ess. The frequent strains
upuu ...j system had a bad effect on my
nerves, for they became so unstrung that I
could not keep them steady, and the most
simple thing in the world could give, me a
start and make me excited. I went on like
this for a little while, thinking that I would
soon be all right again, when I was greatly
surprised to find that I was suffering from
indigestion. That was' an every-day sort of
complaint, I thought, from which some
people suffered severely through not treat-
ing it promptly, and, making up my mind
that I would not make the same mistake, I
started taking medicine for it.”
“A very sensible procedure,” ejaculated
the scribe.
“It would have been had I known the
proper medicine to take, but I had had no
previous experience, so I took whatever I
Baw advertised, and when one thing did me
no good I tried another, thinking that I
would sure to strike the right one in the
end. Sure enough I did, but it was not till
after enduring several years’ intense torture
that a friend advised me to give a trial to
Clements Tonic, but by that time my health
was completely wrecked. The food I per-
suaded myself to take was harder to digest
than ever, and the after effects were much
more trying. A heavy pain settled on my
chest, which gave me great trouble in
getting my breath, especially at night time,
when I often had to sit up in bed, because
I felt as if I would smother if I lay there
any longer, and paroxysms of pain were
caused in my stomach through wind arising
from the decayed food. By these and other
means I was prevented from obtaining any-
thing like a requisite amount of sleep, the
consequence being that when I ought to have
been leaving my bed I was too dead tired to
do so. > I got so miserably weak and low-
Bpirited that I felt as if I could not spe ik to
any ody, whilst the mere thought of doing
a little work seemed preposterous, because I
had no vitality in me to do it for another
reason I did not like exerting myself. That
was because my heart palpitated and pained
me when I put my body in motion, and I
grew so anxious on that score that I resolved
to take the greatest care of myself and not
throw any chances away. But at last I got
bo disheartened that I thought I would never
be well again, a sharp pain catching me
between the shoulders and across the lower
part of my back, while sometimes I could
scarcely see out of my eyes for the terrible
headaches I had. -My tongue was in a dis-
agreeable state, being almost white, am.
everything I tasted seemed bitter ; not that
I tasted much, as I had no appetite at all.
I could not have sat in a wager boat for the
life of me, as I had turns of giddiness,
which inconvenienced me even when stand-
ing on my feet. What had once been hard,
solid flesh became nearly all skin and bone,
so that there was no light ta«k in front of
Clements Tonic when I started taking it.
Another circumstance which I should not
overlook was that I used to have very un-
pleasant dreams on any of those rare
occasions when exhausted nature claimed a
couple of hours’ sleep, so you see what a
perpetual drain there was on my system
through want of proper rest ; and nothing
could ease my pains sufficiently to allow me
to sleep, save Clements Tonic, which gave
me a new feeling of content before the first
week was out. It seemed a marvellous
thing that Clements Tonic could have such
a desirable effect upon me so qui kly, con-
sidering that I had been suffering so long ;
and further use of that medicine showed
that all others were outclassed. The lazy
sense of drowsiness which had made my life
so dreary was given place to a feeling of
exhilaration and activity as a result of using
Clements Tonic, whilst that medicine’s
action on my nervous system was more
beneficial than I had ever deemed possible to
be obtained. My nerves became toned to the
state of perfection they were in when I
could go over a three-mile course at a ding-
dong pace ; and I have such a high opinion
of the strengthening qualities of Clements
Tonic that if I were young enough to start
racing again I would take that medicine for
the purpose of supplying the vitality which
is lost whilst training. For patting my in-
ternal organs into a healthy and machine-
like condition, and driving away headaches,
giddiness and chest pains my acknowledge-
ments go to Clements Tonic, which also
claimed my gratitude for remedying the
palpitations and heart pains. With each
bottle of Clements Tonic I came nearer the
end of my afflictions, for I was eating well
and could digest all manner of food. Windy
spasms and back pains were done away
with by the same medicine, and there was
not an ache left in me. I can frankly
admit that my liver and nerve troubles
were quite cured by Clements Tonic, and
you can publish all I have said in any way
you think advisable.”
“ Thank you,” replied our representative
“ but it is pro 1 able some of your old friends
already know this experience of yours.”
“ Some do, I know; but I can’t tell all of
them, as I know so many thiough living in
this suburb twenty years, while for the last
five years I have been proprietor of the
Leichhardt Swimming Baths.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.

account of my illness and cure by Clements
Tonic, and also contains my full permission to pub-

“A recent advt. in the Argus calls for a * Com-
panion who must be a teetotaller.’ The elderly-
invalid who offers the post had probably had a sad
experience of the giddy young thing or the
advanced spinster, who now and again wore the
vine-leaf in her false hair. Everyone knows the
boarding-house-cat’s life that most ‘ genteel com-
panions ’ are led by their swagger mistresses.
I heir vigilance must never relax, their patience
never exhaust itself ; their voice, their hands, and
their feet never know ache or fatigue. The
poorly-paid, under-fed, sorely tried companion
must be an Amazon and a Spartan to endure this
life without complaint or stimulant. Those who
try the former get their tickets-of-leave. Others
try the latter, and probably in their case the ticket
comes more. slowly though quite as surely. Poor,
bright, musical, cheerful companion !
“A male friend throws a little light on the way
one Melbourne man gets into the swing of
Sassiety in the Big Smoke. This is how he puts it:
‘ Heard a lusty voice addressing me at the Club
the other day. “ Hulloa ! You’re just the man I
want. Here, take a couple of tickets for the
Coronation Ball at the Crystal Palace. Great
affair, old chap, real swell! I took 50 tickets as
soon as they asked me, and then asked them why
they hadn’t got an Australian Committee ? They
said they would be glad to have one. So I formed
one and am chairman of it myself, and here I am

“ Nellie Stewart wore, during the latter nights
°f Mice and Men, ’ the diamond branch brooch
which Rupert Clarke’s nag won for her at the
recent Findon races. It was fastened to her chest
in. some extraordinary way. The strongest glasses
failed to detect the method, and one had to con-
clude that it was some air-cushion dodge. A
smart jewel trick of to-day is a little air-suction
pad, which will hold a brooch on to the flesh as a
fly hangs to a ceiling.
“ Miss Stewart had also a wonderful constellation
of diamond stars that made a luminous path of
glory about her shoulders. No one could tell how
many or how genuine they were, but they
certainly looked most impressive.
“The latest in bargain hits is an advertised
selling out, ‘with sweeping reductions,’ of a Melb.
monumental yard. The marble slabs that have
solemnly stood sunshine and shower in the open
since the last touch of the chisel are now offered
at a tempting price to those who want to
placard the departed. Sweeping reductions in
tombstones are rare. This sale suggests that
now is the time, the acceptable time, for many
people whom I might name, but won’t, to die.
“George Lauri had a very bad quarter of an
hour before going on to sing at Melb. Town Hall
(Walter Kirby’s benefit) the other Saturday after-
noon. Lauri was booked to sing a twaddlesome
ditty from ‘San Toy’ and as the time drew near
he realised the awfulness of his contract. To
appear upon a cold bare platform in cold matinee
blood and irreproachable frock coat, and sing a
‘comic’ song in pigeon-English. ‘lt’s the last
tune they’ll get me at this game ’ moaned the
comedian whilst waiting for his turn. But when
George arrived at the ordeal he scored an in-
explicable triumph.
“ The concert coiffure is a considerable factor of
evening conquest. It runs to ridiculous excesses
—from the Romney ringlet, straggling over a
Bonypart neck, to the high, structural eminence
of framed, puffed, crimped and teased tresses.
The hair-frame extends, and she isalucky woman
who has sufficient thatch to cover these cages
without having her soul plagued out with the
expensive switch,’ the safety of which a passing
hook or bangle-point ever endangers.
Yours affectionately,

As Vic. Chief Justice Madden is the man who (outside
courts of law) always says the right thing, so has Melb.
Mayor Gillott come to be known as the man who invari-
ably puts his foot in it. It was Sam. Gillott who nearly
drove a very loyal and fat assemblage to laughter by
referring to the “ approaching visit of the Duke of New
York” and, the other day, when welcoming strong man
Sandow to Melb., he kept alluding to him throughout the
shivoo as Mr. Sardou. If the meeting had lasted a little
longer Gillott would probably have called him Sardine
before he was done.
Sandow has proved particularly infectious in Mel-
bourne. Developers and grip dumb-bells sell like
lollies, but the result in many instances is really alarm-
ing. Already the big muscle-manufacturer has much to
answer for. Scores of important citizens, having viewed
with consternation the ropy corrugations that ring San-
dow’s loins, have suddenly discovered that they have
been grossly misusing the most noticeable section of
their persons, and devoting it to base purposes of mere
fat. So they have made over-great haste to develop abdomi-
nal muscles. Healthy ratepayers, and stout withal, who,
a few months ago, trod the earth with free and bounding
steps, now crawl painfully along, with bowed heads and
worried looks, and stop frequently to groan. When you
come across a fat friend using bad words and laboriously
endeavoring to straighten himself into a semblance of the
upright citizen he was of yore, it means the same thing
every time—Sandow.
“ H.” : Nobody has yet given a word of praise to
Sandow’s deserving assistants. Their pluck and presence
o' mind are something quite abnormal, for the strong man
tosses aside the huge masses of iron when he is finished
with them, with the nonchalance of the Imperial Govern-
ment tossing troops on a transport or Providence throw-
ing aside a star, and the assistants have to be there to
catch the whirling dumb-bells as they shoot along. A
momentary aberration, a hair’s-breadth error of judg-
ment, might mean death, for Sandow casts his iron
foundry aside most recklessly, while the chances of
broken legs, etc., look about even money. Yet the men
do their work as surely as their principal, and it is work
that calls for quite as much nerve. Mrs. Sandow never
sees her husband perform, so fearful is she that some-
thing may happen to him. What are the feelings of the
wives of those subordinate citizens who catch his used-up
cwt. of iron on the wing, so to speak ?
Fed eral Hansirdist Oscar Bailey, formerly of Adelaide,
with his fair curly hair and butterfly moustache, is being
daily mistaken for Sandow, and dare not stop at a street
corner without some hollow-chested youth approaching
and saying timorously, “ Excuse me, Mr. Sandow, but
can you tell me how to get strong?” In push quarters,
the very appearance of Bailey serves to restore order, and
he may obstruct the traffic all day without a policeman
daring to move him on. One of these davs, Sandow him-
self will be asked why he is not in Parliament gallery,
and warned that he is liable to be sacked for neglect of
duty.
“ N.” : Melba must have, through the mother, a strain
of the blood of the Lord’s People—probably a seventh
c rnsin 21 times removed—mystic numbers—of Bernhardt,
tiachel, Kemble, Siddons, Kean, and Brahm.
rs™ te ’ ls a dro Jl story of Sandow at Kalgoorlie.
af u er the show, and the strong man had sought a
supper-shop to feed the muscles over his diaphragm with
ordered 1 "? ? a -f y ’ A , bot f! e of champagne had been
ordered, but it was a long time overdue, they were eat-
mg the supper and waiting for the wine. At last the
Itahan proprietor of the place came forward to explain
the delay. He was very sorry. The wine had been
brought, but the staff of the establishment had not vet
succeeded in opening the bottle. “ Bring me the bottle,"
said Sandow, with a benign smile. He laid hold of the
corkscrew, and the trouble ended in a second. Then it
dawned upon the restaurateur that it was foolish to keep
the strongest man m the world waiting for his fizz
because the other fellows couldn't draw the cork.
A Melb. pressman, interviewing Sandow, questioned
him as to the story of his having sold his bodv to a
German University for £lOOO. “ Dere is no trut’ inder
roplle u E H§f ne > a ?. d Mrs. Sandow remarked that
the idea was horrible, adding, “ How would you like to

r r^ e Philharmonic Society supplied a fairly artistic
chorus. Next night Amy Castles sang the air with the
unsatisfactory Lyric Chorus behind her. A really fine
result was, of course, out of the question in this case, but
the two renderings of the same air invited a critical
comparison between the solo voices. The younger singer
d * d " rival the operatic lady in vocal power or effect.
Madame Slapoffski is not “ great ” as good sopranos go,
yet she proved to be a lot greater than Miss Amy Castles.
The lucky little woman from Bendigo had better have
accepted the verdict of Marchesi as final. She is a mezzo
lather than a true soprano, and her voice, trained against
its natural bent, has lost volume and ring. The quality
of the boomed organ is good, but the something that
moves an audience is certainly not there. Last week
Amy Castles was said to be singing her Farewell to Aus-
tralia, and the “ Inflammatus” was the last item on the
programme. Had there been any legitimate musical
for the boomln £ of Amy Castles, and the rush of
20,000 people to hear her sing at Melb. Exhibition Build-
ing earlier in the year, the last item on this last Farewell
concert would have moved the audience to some show of
enthusiasm.. It fell as flat as the proverbial pancake.
The crowd didn’t raise enough applause to bring the Star
back to the platform.
“ ®.” • Isn’t “F.” a little sudden in rushing into
print over Nance O’Neil’s “fair success” in Cockney-
ville f And is “ F.” prepared to argue that failure
of Nance in London, supposing it is a failure
destroys all her pretentions as a fine actress?
Would he argue that a Cockney success confirmed the
praises of her warmest Melbourne admirers ? What is a
London success worth as a proof of the artistic quality of
an actor, an actress, or a play? If it stamps the actor
with the undeniable brand of genius, what a drove of
confirmed geniuses The Bulletin has scorned—from
Toole to Barrett—for even Wilson had his London suc-
cesses.
“S.”: George Musgrove, in announcing that the
arrangements of a big theatrical trust to do London, the
provinces, Africa, and Australasia, with probably a look
in at America, are almost completed, only confirms a long-
established Australian suspicion. A couple of years back
one of the brightest spirits in Australian management
declared his intention of getting out of the game as
quickly as possible, as he saw the coming of a big corner
that would knock the small men endways. He got out
and into the comfortable seclusion of a pub. Courtneidge’
the comedian, who was second fiddle to Lonnen in the
latter s Gaiety collection, and has since been managing
for an English provincial syndicate, comes to Australia to
fix things up at this end. The idea promises badly for
the Australian mummer. Shows are to be originated at
~e J? haf *' esl,ury, London > then sent holus-bolus through
all the house? held by the trust, and played by com-
panies with long engagements, which mostly mean short
short wages. Let this kind of thing take hold, and what
hope is there for the Australian drama that otherwise
might have arrived ?
A good story illustrative of dead Melb. critic Guenett’s
predilection for bike accidents was told by Argus man
Maling at a little supper when Guenett resigned the pen
The musician made a special feature of falling off his
wheel just after mounting it on the Oollins-st. hill in
front of the Argus building*. Maling* told how he was
sitting with some companions in the hotel next door
when they were suddenly disturbed by a clatter of
smashed glass and a fall of a long, thin man, a wrecked
bike and a window in their midst. They rushed to dis-
entangle things, and finally extracted Guenett. “I
thought,” said the ruin, “that I’d drop in while I was pass-
ln£- Guenett’s open contempt for the Melbourne traffic
regulations brought him into frequent collision with the
police, and at the time of his death he was under summons
to appear at the police court for some trifling disregard
of the rule of the road. It is to be hoped the golden
streets are wide, for Guenett’s soul will assuredly take
the wrong side and drive furiously over the cherubim.
The balance-sheet of the Melbourne “Amateur Run-
away Girl ” business has been issued. Total receipts for
three performances at Prahran Town Hall, £48614s lid •
total expenses, £319 ss. lOd. Balance available for dis-
tribution between two local hospitals, £167 9s. Id If
each of the nice girls engaged in that laborious vanity
had given as much time to going around with the hat
among her relatives, friends and Johnnies, the result
would probably have been better for the hospitals. And
the men who helped them in their theatrical outbreak
would not now be suffering from the effects. It was
pathetic to hear those male amateurs swapping congra-
tulations in the first flush of their supposititious triumph
“ What we must beware of now is Swelled Head ' ’’—this
in a joyful stage-whisper one to another. Their mutual
warning re their respective heads was freely expressed
but without avail. The swelling had come to stay. ’
Charles, the most celebrated of all the Lauris, is under
engagement to Williamson to tour Australia, beginning
at Christmas next year. His speciality is animal panto-
mime, the Faithful Hound, the Intelligent Monkey* &c. •
but he occasionally comes down (or up) to an Indian
brave or a Man Friday.
Mrs. G. B. Lewis, who celebrates her stage Jubilee
at Melbourne Royal, was leading lady in the
“ Brooke Memorial Fund” performance organised by the
Melb. Press Amateurs in July, 1866. Mrs. Lewis spoke
an epilogue written by Dr. Neild. Of the pressmen who
took part in the comedy and farce, Howard Willoughby
(now editor of the Argus) and James Smith are left to
bear witness to their sin.
An English choir-boy named Wareham has been singing
to crowded audiences in Hobart and Launceston. The
youngster is under 12 years of age, and a very little
fellow at that, but his soprano voice and musical art are
quite remarkable. He sings difficult stuff like a Melba.
If his people can keep him going for as long as the girly
Cyril Tyler lasted, there’s a big fortune in this young
Wareham. He ought to be rushed along to Melbourne
and boomed immediately as the Little Prince of Song or
something in that way.
Obit : John Renno, stage mechanist of many Austra-
lia, 111 theatres, aged 87 years. Mr. Renno kept the
Wheatsheaf Inn at the corner of Foxlow-place and
Castlereagh-st. Sydney, for 20 years. He retired from the
house in 1885, and died in peace at Balmain, Sept. 25.
There has been as much dealing in Melba concert-
tickets as if they were mining shares. One Melbourne
tobacconist, who bought up tickets for the Amy Castles
show hoping to sell at high prices at the last moment, was
lately said to hold 300 tickets for Melba. The speculators
expected to realise three or four times the face value of the
pasteboards. But there are limits to all things, even to
the money paid to hear Melba.
A member of Melbourne Hospital committee is re-
sponsible for the published statement that Melba has
decided (o distribute the whole of her Australian concert
profits among charities, in addition to giving a great
< 7cAn lt ' V c ° ncerfc > for which she has booked three seats at
£5OO each. George Musgrove is one of the five hundred
pound guns of benefaction, her father, David Mitchell, is
another, and the third “ a gentleman whose name was
not given.” This allegation may be awarded the cake for
Melba stories thusfar. Of all the Victorian singers and
musicmns who have gone to Europe for fame and fortune
and have mostly failed to get any, Melba is about the
only one who owes nothing to her native land. Ada
Crossley, Lalla Miranda, Regina Nagel, Maggie Stirling a
couple of small boy pianists, and numerous possessors ’of
voices ranging from mediocre to screechy were sent ’Ome
with a flourish of Town Hall benefit trumpets and a big
bag of benefit dollars. But Mrs. Armstrong (now Melba)
—her send-off concert happened at Melb. Athemeum
Hall, and the fruits of the unpretentious event were £6O
She had no newspaper prophets in her own country, save
the late Kiely, of the Argus, who ventured to say her
voice was equal to that of lima di Murska, and celebrity
in Europe would surely come to her.
Two very ancient N.S.W. miners died last
Sunday—George Slater (at Orange), and William
VVilliams(at Adelong Crossing). Slater, the “King
of Orange,” was aged 82, and was a veteran of the
early Ophir days. Williams dated from the
mythical and legendary period of the world’s
history, and was reputed to be aged 102. He was
said to have acquired £250,000 worth of gold
during 80 years of more or less persistent search.
Concerning a recent Bulletin par. to the
effect that Ann-street Presbyterian Church,
Brisbane, had applied to Carnegie for a donation
towards its organ fund, The Bulletin receives a
vigorous assurance from the pastor of that church
that no person who has any right to speak on
behalf of the church has applied to Carnegie for
a copper for any purpose whatever. Nor, so far
as Pastor Frackelton isaware, has any unauthorised
person done so. In any case the church is not
responsible for what any unauthorised person may
do the world is full of unauthorised persons.
Under these circumstances the imputation is
unreservedly withdrawn with regretful apologies
to an unintentionally-maligned church, which, it
seems, has sufficient energy and self-respect to pay
for its own organ. The person who supplied the
misleading information is now being pursued, and
will be executed as soon as overtaken.
One oft-recurring Victorian candidate
eagerly jumped at the chance of standing once again
for a metropolitan constituency, and rushed round
to make things right with the “Reform” crowd
and its minions, the Irvine Govt. After getting
the Kyabram irrigation-swindle nomination, he
set to work among his prospective constituents,
only to find that he required nearly 3000 votes to
win, and that the total muster of the six branch
“Reform” leagues in his district was 39 and a
boy. The six leagues had made so much row that
he thought they were at least 2000 strong. One
dodge of country candidates to get Government
support was to rally up their personal friends in
every little centre, constitute “branches” of the
Meudell - Gillespie ring, and flood the trustful
Irvine with telegrams to the effect that they had
been given the unanimous support of .16 branches
of the League, including those at Cow Vale and
Billjim’s Ruins.
Sydney D.T. hasn’t had a hand in making
a Ministry for so long that it is desperately eager
now to promote a successful vote of censure and
have Carruthers waiting on its door-mat whilst it
decides who are to have portfolios. To that
eagerness, rather than to any special anxiety for
the purity of justice, is probably ascribable its
anxiety as to the “Friedman case.” The case
boiled down : A firm of fancy-goods importers
charged one of its employees (he was paid
£2 13s. 4d. a month, and was left in charge of a
valuable stock for long periods) with stealing
goods wholesale and selling them to persons
who knew them to be stolen. The employee
gave ‘ ‘ King’s evidence. ” The first case was against
Friedman. Judge Rogers, a man of irreproach-
able integrity (who, by the way, has been in very
poor health lately, which may have clouded his
judgment), was convinced of Friedman’s innocence.
The jury, on the evidence and on its own conclu-
sions as to the value of the goods which,
admittedly, Friedman bought from the dishonest
employee—conclusions which it is alleged Judge
Rogers did not give himself the opportunity of
making—decided that he was guilty. Judge Rogers
then sentenced him, stating again his certain con-
viction that the prisoner was innocent. Friedman’s
friends petitioned the Minister for Justice (Mr.
B. R. Wise), who called for a report from Judge
Rogers. The Judge stated straightly that there had
been a miscarriage of justice, and that Friedman
was innocent. Acting on this, Mr. Wise promptly
released the man. Note the series of blunders
and indiscretions: Judge Rogers might have
“withdrawn the case from the jury” if he had
been so certain of Friedman’s innocence ; or he
might have sentenced him to one minute’s im-
prisonment; and he should not (if he did) have
let the jury get evidence of which he was un-
aware and the accused was unaware. But he
would take no responsibility. Mr. Wise, however,
took the whole responsibility of releasing the man
he was assured was innocent. It was a blazing
indiscretion, from a party-politics point of view,
especially in view of the cold-blooded persistence
with which successive Ministers for Justice in
N.S.W. refused to give a re-hearing to the case of
the almost-certainly innocent Suffield.
The rush to hear the Queen of Song at a
guinea shows that the discriminating public will
pay any price for the superlative. But in D.C.L.,
which is the Queen of Whiskies, likewise the King
and Prime Minister, a superlative article can be
obtained without paying a superlative price. And
the superlative in wit, wisdom and common sense
all rush D.O.L. at a moderate price.*
New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co
Ltd. reports, for week ended Sept. 27, that local trans-
actions in wool are off. London rise in prices is being
maintained. Sheepskins are also improving in demand,
especially full-woolled merinoes. Scrub wallabies are
distinctly easier, and kangaroos and wallaroos just main-
tain their position. Bear, rabbit and swamp wallabies
showed an occasional advance. ’Possums were in con-
siderable demand. Hides were also wanted, and showed
an occasional advance of £d. per lb. Tallow climbed up
from 10s. to 12s. 6d. per ton, and the market closed
firmly. Hide pieces and.horns were in active demand.
With the exception of horsehair, which showed signs of
weakness, sundries remained unchanged. Wheat market
was firm as supplies were scarce. Shipments are ex-
pected from India. Local crops are progressing very*
slowly, and quotations, which are only nominal, are ss.
and ss. Id. per bushel for prime grain. Maize advanced
in price till supplies of inferior quality knocked the
bottom out of the demand, and prime closed at 65., and
inferior from 4s. 6d. per bushel.
An unimpeachable testimony recently received
from the lyric tenor, Mr. Philip Newbury, so popularly
appreciated by the Australian public as one of their finest
singers, proves beyond criticism the efficacy in curing
-blood and nerve disorders by electro-medical treat-
ment, or the judicious use of electricity and medicine.
Mr. Newbury suffered for years from uric acid in the
blood, with goutish tendencies, but, to quote his own
words, after consulting the specialists of the Freeman and
Wallace Electro-Medical and Surgical Institute, corner
Elizabeth and Bathurst sts., Sydney, and wearing one of
their electric “Invigorators,” “he was completely cured.”
Blood disorders are the specialities of the Institute. In
these diseases, the specialists have done more practical
good than any similar association of Australian medical
men.*

In this lies the lesson we would teach.

WHAT THE WORLD’S SCIENTISTS SAY.
THAT half of the nervous affections from which people Buffer arise through imperfect and insufficient nerve force. Rob the body of animal magnetism, and paralysis and dis-
order of the chief functions follow. Pluck a flower—it withers. The principle is the same. It is one which involves Death.
Physicians of the widest experience and highest attainment declare that where nervous disorders arise from structural changes m the great nerve centres, the treatment
which lends itself with direct adaptability and possessing most curative results is that of Electricity combined with medical treatment. Many eminent professional medical experts
assert this fact—that where nervous exhaustion and functional disorders are present, symptoms show themselves in sleeplessness, great niuscular debility, headaohe, backache, mental
incapacity, loss of appetite with dyspepsia, and constipation, weariness or a condition of weariness and unrest. The intensity and variety of these symptoms indicate how greatly
the system is affected.
Electricity adopted judiciously with restorative medicines have powerful reconstructive influences. An electric “ Invigorator ” worn around the loins for a few hours
nightly will effect a great and lasting change by pouring into the nerves that necessary vitality which being absent forms the nucleus of disease. _
Read the two following testimonials from persons who have suffered and tried the treatment. Then if you are ill, consult the Specialists and speak likewise.

WE do not ask you to believe that an
“ Invigorator ” will entirely cure
you of disease, but our “ Invigor-
ators,” used with our medicines, accom-
plishes that which neither electricity or
medicine alone can do. The two together
have wonderful renovative effects, and con-
tain reconstructive elements in cases of
degenerated and enfeebled constitutions
which amaze the medical Faculty. Our
“ Invigorators ” are the only ones tested
by two of Sydney’s leading electricians.
We hold certificates of genuineness unpos-
sessed by others. We have several classes,
which vary in value according to cost of
construction. Our £lO instrument oontains
the same Current as those at £1 (which we
specially recommend), but it also contains
2oz. of 18et. gold, which raises the value.
If you require a test privately it will be
given you.
We ask you to read these prices and then
give one of these instruments a trial. What-
ever you suffer from where your natural
strength and nerve power is lacking, you
will be strengthened. The desire of a man
is to be with the victors, not the vanquished.
To be sfronj?, hearty, healthy—that is your

of the Coronation one day after the ceremony took
place. Seems Australia’s determined to break all
records.
I3y the arrival of Miss Isis Pogson, a gifted
little lady, late Government Meteorologist, Madras
Presidency, it looks as if Wragge will find his nose
out of joint. Miss Pogson’s primary mission to
Brisbane is to marry a well-known captain, to
whom she is engaged ; but she is bound to take an
interest in the weather when she settles down.
And a woman-prophet will be so much more
attractive than a man.

The story of a N.S. W. municipal council as
told in N.S.W. Assembly. Silverton started
business as a municipality with 6 aldermen, 8U
ratepayers, 286 residents, and 26,240 acres,
borrowed freely and after a while found itsell
unable to pay interest on its borrowings or even to
pay the wages of its council clerk. This employee
finally got a judgment against the council, and, in
satisfaction thereof, seized the “Town Hall, had
it put on a van, carted it to Broken Hill and sold
it. The municipal history of Silverton then
ended. But the municipal debt still hangs round.

N.S.W. Asylums Department, which has
represented the hideous old barracks of a building
known as George-sfc. Asylum, Parramatta, as
being unsafe for housing several hundred old men,
succeeded in having the place condemned. Now
several hundred pounds have been spent in erect-
ing workshops and other accessories to the con-
demned institution. Mr. Kelly, M.L.A., has
moved for the appointment of a select committee
to inquire into the treatment of the inmates of
the Newington and Kookwood Asylums. He
should extend this to the Parramatta institutions.
Under the heading of “ A Victim to Gam-
bling and Betting,” Sydney Daily Telegraph
lately told the story of how a clerk, charged with
the embezzlement of £1037 10s., had been in
receipt of the princely salary of £2 per week.
Every morning that young man received a cheque
for some £2OOO or £3OOO, which he had to cash and
with the "proceeds pay for scrip. He had been
with the firm eight years. Tired of the hopeless-
ness of his outlook, he had tried to make a fortune
on the racecourse and other gambling specula-
tions, and, as usual, had fallen in. If the Tele-
graph had been just, it would have headed its
yarn “ A Victim of Outrageous Sweating.” The
employer probably got a whole stack more honesty
than he paid for, and it is pleasing to learn that
the missing money has apparently gone beyond
any chance of recovery. Ifyall Judges were as
sensible and humane as Williams, of Victoria,
who refused to gaol a young man who had em-
bezzled the bank’s cash, on the ground that the
bank was to blame for not paying a man holding
such a responsible position a living,wage, it would
do a lot to stamp out this sort of thing. Why
should the State be burdened with the cost of the
keep of men who have been made criminals by
their employers ?
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, Under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and he'en told your case is hopeless, or
® ubmit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
\URLYOu. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured,

CEIVED IN THE FORM OF TESTI-
MONIALS AND GRATEFUL LETTERS
BY
Herr RASSMUSSEW
v f
THE WORLD-FAMED DANISH
HERBALIST & BOTANIST,
PROPRIETOR OF THE
ALFALINE
HERBAL
REGISTERED
REME
ES
A FEW WORDS TO THE UNINITIATED.
PERSONAL AND PERTINENT.—Those who have not met Herr Rassmussen, and
who have not given his Alfaline Herbal Remedies a trial, may find it Beneficial to become
acquainted with the good work which he has done in the interest of suffering humanity for
the last twenty years.
ALONG BACK IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES
Herr Rassmussen introduced his now world-famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies to the Australian public at 547 George
Street, Sydney. Australia was then flooded with American importations and proprietary remedies, manufactured
by doubtful persons with assumed names and fictitious addresses, who took the people’s money without
responsibility, and very often without giving them fafr value for same.
HERR RASSMUSSEN BROUGHT ABOUT A REVOLUTION
by straightforward and fair dealings with the public, offering to stake his reputation and future if his remedies
were not as efficacious as he claimed them to be, accepting all responsibility, and willing to abide by the people’s
verdict.
THE HAPPY RESULT IS KNOWN TO EVERYONE.
Over twenty years have passed away, hundreds of remedies have come and gone—many of them were forced on
the public in numerous designing ways—thousands of pounds spent on advertising same with the assistance of the
world’s greatest experts in laying traps for the unwary; but the public would have none of them, and they have
disappeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning.
“THE ALFALINE REMEDIES EXCELL ALL OTHERS,”
and are well known to be more popular to-day than they have ever been. They have not only obtained, but
have retained the goodwill and confidence of the Australian public, and have become famous throughout the
civilized world. The first Sydney Office not only yet exists, but offices have been opened up for their sale at
Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Wellington, N.Z., and in West Australia at Perth, Fremantle, Kalgoorlie and
Boulder City, with Agencies throughout the world.
LET THE PUBLIC JUDGE FROM THE FOLLOWING:—
The Alfaline Remedies have held their own for oyer twenty years in Australia, and Herr Rassmussen has
been awarded the Parisian Aeadamies’ Gold Medal and Diploma of Honour ; Gold Medal, Sydney, and several Silver
Medals; honourably mentioned in almost every newspaper in Australia; received many thousands of unsolicited
testimonials—every one of the originals open for inspection at his Offices. The Alfaline Remedies have neyer been
known to fail to cure in a single instance.
ARE THEY NOT WORTH A TRIAL?
if they are, why not try them to-day ? why leave it till to-morrow and, perhaps, lose your chance and time ? No
order so small that it is not welcome ;no order so large that it cannot be executed at once. If you first wish
evidence of the efficacy of the Alfaline Remedies, *
SEND FOR HIS FREE BOOK,
and read what the experienced have to say, and what the Australian newspapers have to say—the double distilled
extracts from the Press speak for themselves.

An estimate of the value of the lands
in Sydney and other parts of N.S.W. given by
Gov. Macquarie as gratuities to early colonists,
often for mere friendship’s sake, reaches, at
present prices, many millions of pounds.
Macquarie, among other benefactions, granted
Sam Terry 1200 acres on the Hawkesbury, and
2000 elsewhere; Surgeon Harris, 2600 acres (a lot
of it at Ultimo); and D’Arcy Wentworth, 2200
acres (much of it at Yaucluse).
“ ff.F.” offers some counsel:—
Re Sandow and his much-boomed physical culture
system: it seems to be generally accepted, without
question, that an all-round development of the muscular
system is desirable. The writer ventures to doubt it. Of
what use to the average man to be able to lift two tons,
or develop abnormal strength not required by his occu-
pation ? Muscular strength does not prolong life ; it de-
mands constant exercise to maintain it or there is danger
of fatty degeneration ; also, it rarely accompanies mental
energy. To a brain worker the less physical exercise
compatible with health the better. Nature is economical
of energy ; a heavy meal, violent exercise, or a cold
shower, take the blood from the brain to stomach, limb
or skin, and leave the thinker bankrupt. Chamberlain,
who never walks when he can ride, or rides if he can sic at
home, knows his book. Doubtless thousands ruin their
mental powers by physical exercise. The navvy, smith
and wharf-lumper are generally dullards; while the tailor
and cobbler are mostly intelligent. Next to the brain
the vital organ is the heart, which is frequently ruined by
athletics, or the stoppage of them when once begun.
Moral:—Young man, if you don’t want to wield a pick
and shovel, sit still.

PEARS
The Blindness of One-Eyed
Bogan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They judge not, and they are not judged—’tie their
philosophy.
There’s something wrong with every ship that sails upon
the sea.
—Ballad of the Rouseabout.
“One-Eyed Bogan was a hard case, Mitchell,”
I said. “Wasn’t he?”
“ Yes,” said Mitchell, patting down his long-
beer glass, “he was.”
“ Rather a bad egg ? ”
“Yes—a regular bad egg,” said Mitchell
decidedly.
“I heard he got caught cheating at cards,” I
said.
“Did you?” said Mitchell. “Well, I believe
he did. Ah, well! ” he added reflectively, after
another long pull, “ One-Eyed Bogan won’t cheat
at cards any more. ”
“ Why ? ” I said. “ Is he dead then ? ”
“No,” said Mitchell—“he’s blind.”
“Good God!” I said. “How did that
happen ?”
“He lost the other eye,” said Mitchell, and he
took another drink—“Ah, well! he won’t cheat
at cards any more—unless there’s cards invented
for the blind.”
“ How did it happen ? ” I asked.
“Well,” said Mitchell, “ you see, Harry, it was
this way. Bogan went pretty free in Bourke after
the shearing before last, and in the end he got
mixed up in a very ugly-looking business ; he was
accused of doing two new-chum jackeroos out of
their stuff by some sort of confidence-trick.”
“ Confidence-trick ! ” I said. “ I’d never have
thought that One-Eyed Bogan had the brains to
go.in for that sort of thing.
“Well, it seems he had —or else he used some-
body else’s brains. There’s plenty of broken-down
English gentlemen-sharpers knocking about Out-
Back, you know, and Bogan might have been taking
lessons from one. I don’t know the rights of the
case. It was hushed up —as you'll see presently.
Anyway, the jackeroos swore that Bogan had done
’em out of ten quid. They were both cockneys,
and I suppose they reckoned themselves smart;
but bushmen have more time to think. Besides,
Bogan’s one eye was in his favor ; you see, he
always kept his one eye fixed strictly on whatever
business he had in hand. If he’d had another eye
to rove round and distract his attention and look
at things on the outside, the chances are he would
never have got into trouble. ”
“Never mind that, Jack,” said Tom Hall.
“ Harry wants to hear the yarn.”
“Well, to make it short, one of the jackeroos
went to the police, and Bogan cleared out. His
character was pretty bad just then, so there was
a piece of blue paper out for him. Bogan didn’t
seem to think the thing was so serious as it was,
for he only went a few miles down the river, and
camped with his horses on a sort of island inside
an anabranch, till the thing should blow over or
the new-chums leave Bourke.
“Bogan’s old enemy, Constable Campbell, got
wind of Bogan’s camp, and started out after him.
He rode round the outside track, and came in on
to the river just below where the anabranch joins
it, at the lower end of The island and right op-
posite Bogan’s camp. /You know what those
billabongs are: dry gullies till the river rises from
the Queensland rains, and backs them up till the
water runs round into the river again and makes
anabranches of them. iThere’s no water so
treacherous and deceitful as you’ll find in some of
those billabongs. A man starts to ride across a
place where he thinks the water is just over the
grass and blunders into a deep channel —that
wasn’t there before —with a steady undercurrent
with the whole weight of the Darling River fun-
nelled into it; and if he can’t swim, and his horse
isn’t used to it —or, sometimes, if he can—it’s a
case with him ; and the Darling River cod hold an
inquest on him. And somebody advertises in the
missing column for Jack Somebody, who was last
heard of in Australia ——.”
““Never mind'that, Mitchell —go on,” I said.
“ Well, Campbell knew the river and saw that
there was a stiff current there, so he hailed Bogan.
“ ‘ Good day, Campbell! ’ shouted Bogan.
j “ ‘I want you, Bogan,’ said Campbell. ‘ Come
across and bring your horses.’
“ ‘ I’m damned if I will,’ says Bogan. ‘ I’m not
going to catch me death o’ cold to save your
skin. If you want me, you’ll have to come and
git me.’ Bogan was a good, strong swimmer, and
he'had good horses, but he didn’t try to get away.
I suppose he reckoned he’d have to face the music
one time or another —and one time is as good as
another outback.
“ Campbell was no swimmer; he had no tempta-
tion to risk his .life. You see, it wasn’o like in
war, with a lot of comrades watching, ready to
advertise a man as a coward for staying alive, so
he argued with Bogan and tried to get him to
listen to reason, and swore at him. ‘ I’ll make it
damned hot for you, Bogan,’ he said, ‘ if I have to
come over for you. ’
“ ‘ Two can play at that game,’ says Bogan.
“ ‘Look here, Bogan,’ said Campbell, ‘l’ll tell
you what I’ll do. If you give me your word that
you’ll comp np to the police-station to-morrow,
I’ll go back and say nothing about it. You can
say you didn’t know a warrant was out after you.
It will be all the better for you in the end. Better
give me your word, man.’
“Perhaps Campbell knew Bogan better than
any of us.
“ ‘Now then, Bogan,’ he said, ‘don’t be a fool.
Give your word like a sensible man and I’ll go
back. I’ll give you five minutes to make up your
mind,’’and he took out his watch.
“But Bogan was nasty, and wouldn’t give his
word, so there was nothing for it but for Campbell
to make a,try for him.
“Campbell had plenty of pluck—or obstinacy,
which amounts to the same thing. He put his
carbine and Revolver under a log, out of the rain
that was'coming on, saw to his hand-cuffs, and
then spurred his horse into the water. Bogan lit
his pipe with a stick from his camp fire, so Camp-
bell said afterwards, and sat down on his heels and
puffed away and waited for him.
“ Just as Campbell’s horse floundered into the
current, Bogan shouted to go back, but Campbell
thought it was a threat, and kept on. But Bogan
had caught sight of a log coming down the
stream, end on, with, a sharp, splintered end, and
before Campbell knew where he was, the sharp
end of that log caught the horse in the flank. The
horse started to plunge and struggle sideways,
with all his legs, and Campbell got free of him as
quick as he could. Now, you know, in some of
those Darling River reaches the current will seem
to run steadily for a while, and then eome with a
rush (I was caught in one of those rushes once
when I was in swimming, and would have been
drowned if I hadn’t been born to be hanged).
Well, a rush came along, just as Campbell got
free from his horse, and he went down one side of
a snag and his horse the other. Campbell’s pretty-
stout, you know, and his uniform was tight, and
it handicapped him.
“Just as he was being washed past the lower
end of the snag he caught hold of a branch that
stuck out of the water and held on. He swung
round, and saw Bogan running doVn to the point
opposite him. Now, you know there was always
a lot of low cunning about Bogan; and I suppose
he reckoned that if he pulled Campbell out, he’d
stand a good show of getting clear of his trouble
anyway ; if he didn’t save Campbell it might be
said that he killed him. Besides, Bogan was a
good swimmer ; so there wasn’t any heroism about
it anyhow. Campbell was only a few feet from
the bank, but Bogan started to strip—to make the
job look as big as possible, I suppose. He shouted
to Campbell to say he was coming, and to hold
on. Campbell said afterwards that Bogan seemed
an hour undressing. The weight of the current
was forcing down the bough that Campbell was
hanging on to, and suddenly, he said, he felt a
great feeling of helplessness take him by the
shoulders. He yelled to Bogan, and let go.
“Now, it happened that Jake Boreham and I
were passing away the time between shearings,
and we were having a sort of fishing and shooting
loaf down the river in a boat arrangement that
Jake had made out of boards and tarred canvas.
We called her the ‘Jolly Coffin.’ We were just
poking up the bank in the slack water, a few hun-
dred yards below the billabong, when Jake said,
‘Why, there’s a horse or something in the river,’
then he shouted, ‘No, by Cod, it’s a man,’ and
we poked the Coffin out into the stream for all she
was worth, ‘ Looks like two men fighting in the
water,’ Jake shouts presently. ‘Hurry up, or
they’ll drown each other.’
“We hailed’em, and Bogan shouted for help.
He was treading water and holding Campbell up
in front of him now, in real professional style. As
he heard us he threw up his arm and splashed
a bit —I reckoned he was trying to put as much
style as he could into that rescue. But I caught a
crab, and, before we could get to them, they were
washed past into the top of a tree that stood well
below flood-mark. I pulled the boat’s head round,
and let her stern down between the branches.
Bogan had one arm over a limb and was holding
Campbell with the other, and trying to lift him
higher out of the water. I noticed Bogan’s face
was bleeding—there was a dead limb stuck in the
tree with nasty sharp points on it, and I reckoned
he’d run his face against one of them. Campbell
was gasping like a codfish out of water, and he
was the whitest man I ever saw—(except one—
and he’d been drowned for a week). Campbell had
the sense to keep still. We asked Bogan if he
could hold on, and he said he could, but he
couldn’t hold Campbell any longer. So Jake took
the oars, and I leaned over the stern and caught
hold of Campbell, and Jake ran the boat into the
bank, and we got him ashore; then we went back
for Bogan, and landed him.
“We had some whisky, and soon brought
Campbell round ; but Bogan was bleeding like a
pig from a nasty cut over his good eye; so we
bound wet handkerchiefs round his eyes, and led
him to a log, and he sat down for a while, holding
his hand to his eye and groaning. He kept say-
ing, ‘ I’m blind, mates, I’m blind ! I’ve lost me
other eye ! ’ but we didn’t dream it was so bad as
that; we kept giving him whisky. We got some
dry boughs and made a big fire. Then Bogan
stood up, and held his arms stiff down to his
sides, opening and shutting his hands, as if he was
in great pain.
“Presently Jake listened, and said, ‘ By God,
that’s lucky ! ’ and we heard a steamer coming up
river, and presently we saw her coming round the
point, with a coupie of wool-barges in tow. We
got Bogan aboard and got some clothes on him,
and took him ashore at Bourke to the new
hospital. The doctors did all they knew, but
Bogan was blind for life. He never saw anything
again—except ‘a sort of dull white blur,’as he
called it—or his past life sometimes, I suppose.
Perhaps he saw that.for the first time.
“ Bogan’s old enemy, ‘ Barcoo-Rot,’went to see
him in the hospital, and Bogan said, ‘Well,
Barcoo, I reckon we’ve had our last fight. I owe
you a hiding, but I don’t see how I’m going to pay
you.’ ‘ Never mind that, Bogan, old man,’ says
Barcoo. ‘ I’ll take it from anyone yer likes to
. appoint, if that worries yer; and, look here,
Bogan, if I can’t fight you, I can fight for you—
and don’t you forget it ! ’ And Barcoo used to
lead Bogan round the town in his spare time, and
tell him all that was going on ; and I believe he
always had an ear cocked in case someone said a
word against Bogan—as if any of the chaps would
say a word against a blind man.
“ Bogan’s case was hushed up. The police told
us to fix it up the best way we could. One of the
jackeroos, who reckoned that Bogan had swindled
him, was a gentleman, and he was the first to
throw a quid in the Giraffe’s hat when it went
round for Bogan. But the other jackeroo was a
cur ; he said that he wanted the money that Bogan
had robbed him of. There were two witnesses,
but we sent ’em away, and Tom Hall, there, scared
the jackeroo —you know Tom was always the best
hand we had at' persuading witnesses in union
cases to go home to see their mothers.”
“How did you scare that jackeroo, Tom? I
asked. .
“Tell you about it some other time, said
Tom.
“Well,” said Mitchell, “Bogan was always a
good wool-sorter, so, next shearing, old Baldy
Thompson—(you know Baldy Thompson, Harry,
of West-o’-Sunday station)—Baldy had a talk with
some of the chaps, and took Bogan out in his
buggy with him to West-o’-Sunday. Bogan would
sit at the end of the rolling tables, in the shearing
shed, with a boy to hand him the fleeces, and he’d
feel a fleece and tell the boy what bin to throw it
into ; and, by-and-bye, he began to learn to throw
the fleeces into the bins himself. And sometimes
Baldy would have a sheep brought to him and get
him to feel the fleece and tell him the quality of
it. And then again Baldy would talk, just loud
enough for Bogan to overhear, and swear that
he’d sooner have Bogan, blind as he was, than
half-a-dozen scientific jackeroo experts, with all
their eyes about them.
“ Of course, Bogan wasn’t worth anything much
to Baldy, but Baldy gave him two pounds a week
out of his own pocket, and another quid that we
made up among us; so he made enough to pull
him through the rest of the year.
“It was curious to see how soon he learned to
find his way about the hut, and manage his tea
and tucker." It was a rough shed, but everybody
was eager to steer Bogan about—and, in fact, two
of them had a fight about it one day. Baldy and
all of us—and especially visitors when they came—
were mighty interested in Bogan ; and I reckon
we were rather proud of having a blind wool-
sorter. I reckon Bogan had thirty or forty pairs
of eyes watching out for him, in case he’d run
against something or fall. It irritated him to be
messed round too mueh 5 he said a baby would
never learn to walk if it was held all the time.
He reckoned he’d learn more in a year than a
man who’d served a lifetime to blindness; but we
didn’t let him wander much for fear he’d fall into
a big rocky water-hole there by accident.
“And after the shearing season Bogan’s wife
turned up in Bourke
“ Bogan’s wife !” I exclaimed. Why, I never
knew Bogan was married.” . , ..
“ Neither did anyone else, said Mitchell.
“ But he was. Perhaps that was what accounted
for Bogan. Sometimes, in his sober moods, 1
used to have an idea that there must have been
something behind Bogan to account for him.
Perhaps he got trapped, or got married and found
out that he’d made a mistake, which is about the
worst thing a man can find out.
“Or that both did,” reflected Mitchell— Ah
well! —never mind. Bogan had been married two
or three years. Maybe he got married when he
was on the spree—l knew that he used to send
money-to someone in Sydney, and I suppose it
was her. Anyway, she turned up after he was
blind. She was a hard-looking woman just the
sort that might have kept a third-rate pub or a
sly-grog shop. But you can’t judge between
husband and wife ; unless you’ve lived in the same
house with them, and under the same roofs with
parents right back to Adam for that matter.
Anyway, she stuck to Bogan all right. she took
a little two-roomed cottage and made him com-
fortable ; she’s got a sewing machine and a mangle
and takes in washing and sewing. She brought a
carrotty-headed youngster with her, and, the first
time I saw Bogan sitting on the verandah with
that youngster on his knee, I thought it was a
good thing that he was blind.”
“Why?” I asked. _ , . ~ , ~
“ Because the youngster isn t his, said Mitchell.
“ How do you know that ? ” ... ,
“By the look of it; and by the look on her
face, once, when she caught me squinting from the
kid’s face to Bogan’s.” _ #
“ A curious thing about Bogan is that he s
begun to be fidgetty about his personal appear-
ance ; and you know he wasn’t a dood. He wears
a collar now, and polishes his boots; he wears
elastic sides and polishes ’em himself the only
thing is that he blackens over the elastic. He can
do many things for himself and he’s proud of it.
He says he can see many things that he couldn t
see when he had eyes. You seldom hear him
swear, save in a friendly way; he seems much
gentler, but he reckons he would stand a show
with Barcoo Rot even now, if Barcoo would stand
up in front of him and keep yelling ”
“By the way,” X asked, “ how did Bogan lose
the sight of his other eye ? ”
“ Sleeping out in the rain when he was drunk,
said Mitchell. “He got a cold in his eye.”
“Come on, Mitchell,” said Tom Hall, “you’ve
had enough beer.”
“I think I have,” said Mitchell. “Besides, 1
promised to send a wire to Jake Boreham, to tell
him that his mother’s dead. Jake’s shearing at
West-o’-Sunday ; shearing won’t be over for three
or four weeks, and Jake wants an excuse to get
away, without offending old Baldy, and come
down and have a fly round with us before the holi-
days are over.” .
Down at the telegraph-office Mitchell took a
form, and filled it in very carefully
“Jacob Boreham. West-o’-Sunday station,
Bourke. Come home at once. Mother is dead.
In terrible trouble. Father dying.— Tom Bobe-
ham.” , „ „ T .
“I think that will do,” said Mitchell. It
ought to satisfy Baldy, and it won’t give Jake too
much of a shock, because he hasn’t got a brother,
and his father and mother’s been dead over ten

HENRY LAWSON.
Rev. A. F. M. Robb, a Melbourne Presby-
terian shepherd, gave his congregation a graphia
account of the awful drought effects on this uisuf-
ficiently-prayed-for country. The good, man told
them that farmers and graziers going their
“rounds” in the parched districts “heard the
groans and cries of the dead dumb creatures on
every side.” .
Indigestion results from taking too much
food or some article of food of difficult
digestion. There is a feeling of distress and
sometimes severe cramps of the stomach,
nausea, vomiting, and sometimes purging,
but most often constipation.
The vomiting is beneficial as it relieves the
stomach of the indigestible food, and when
the bowels remain normal and there is no
cramping pains of the stomach, no medicine
whatever is required. All that is needed is
to let the stomach rest, take no food until
hungry, and then only a small amount of
milk toast, until the stomach is strong enough
to digest other food which should be taken
sparingly at first. When there is constipa-
tion, two of Chamberlain’s Stomach
and Liver Tablets should be taken to
move the bowels, and one tablet each follow-
ing day for three or four days until. the
bowels become regular. If Chamberlain’s
Stomach and Liver Tablets act two freely
on the bowels, take only one tablet every
other day.


FACE TO FACE WITH FACTS
Most all the Aches of Kidney Ills start with
FACTS.
A lame back is a bad back.
A weak back is a bad back.
An aching back is a bad back.
Bad Backs come from sick
kidneys.
Sick kidneys cause backache.
Backache is the first step.
The first ache of kidney ills.
Urinary troubles come next.
Disturb your night’s rest.
Annoy you all day.
Dangerous Diabetes sets in.
Then Bright’s Disease.
The end is war then.
H Bad Back.
Every Case of Back-
ache, Diabetes, or
any Kidney Ills can
be Cured by
MORE FACTS .
Don’t pay to experiment.
Kidney trouble is too serious.
Delays are dangerous.
Experiment means delay.
Take a remedy that’s endorsed.
But get good endorsement.
A stranger’s word isn’t sufficient.
Hard to prove testimonials from a
distance.
Take the word of people you know.
Of friends and neighbors.
Easy to prove such evidence.
Ask them about it.
Local testimony is the best.

["from LEICHHARDT. 1
Mr. J. Cameron, 297 Balmain-road, Leichhardt, this city,
says:—“ For a few years I had been trying to get the upper hand
of kidney trouble, but all my efforts were futile until I used Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. I used to have pains in the back, and
these were so bad I had to lie about pretty well which
will give you a better idea of the serious condition I was in than
any other illustration. I had begun to imagine that it was not in
the power of medicine to bring me relief, when I got a box of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills at Newman’s Pharmacy, King-
street. This remedy began to do that which so many had failed
4o do. A few doses gave me an immense amount of relief, and in
a little while cured me completely otpains in the back, and put
my kidneys in perfect order. I can give these pills a first-rate
’recommendation j I know others who have been cured by ; ’ £r
{FROM GLEBE |
Mr. William Greenland, who is a printer, lives at 22 Forsyth-
street, Glebe. He says : —“ For some considerable time I suf-
fered from backache and kidney complaint, having a heayy aohing
pain in the small of my back just over the kidneys, which troubled
me a good deal. The secretions were very much disordered, con-
fining a large amount of sediment. I procured some of Doan’s
Baokache Kidney Pills at Newman’s Pharmacy in King-street,
and now I have pleasure in stating that they did me a great deal
of good, completely removing my trouble and putting the kidneys
in a healthy state. Although I had previously tried a number of
pther remedies I failed to get any benefit from them. I have
recommended Doan’s Pills to a number of people, some of whom
I know have tried them, and, like myself, nave derived greet
benefit from them,”
Get what you ask for. Get DOAN’S.

On the Brink,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I love thee, love thee ! wild old sea !
Dear refuge from the cold grey earth,
The world rejects, despises me,
A nameless girl, condemned from birth—
A creature void of worth.
The sea-gulls float beneath my feet,
Soft cradled on the darkling deep,
To lie beside them must be sweet,
To rest for aye in dreamless sleep,
No more to moan and weep.
I cannot, do not, wish for rest,
Thou know’st, my sea, I do but rave ;
I long for life within thy breast,
This chilling earth I find a grave,
And full, strong life I crave.
My dearest playmate, when a child
Thy wild, sweet song enchanted me—
I listened wrapt when wavelets smiled
And whispered to me ceaselessly
The wonders of the sea.
I heard of fanes of gems and gold,
Whose cover is thy purple might,
Of life where none grow sad or old,
Where days are filled with pure delight,
And hid from human sight.
They tell me “God is over all,”
How well I know that hollow lie !
When I, a helpless woman, fall,
What mortal hearkens to my sigh ?
Who heeds though I should die ?
The churchmen’s tales of Heaven and God,
By craven mortals neatly conned,
May touch and cheer the soulless clod,
With whom I have no link or bond ;
The sea is my Beyond.
My lover is the glorious Sea,
Held close within his mighty arms,
When he shall kiss me tenderly,
I can no longer feel alarms,
Safe from all earthly harms.
It is not death to which I go—
My lover will give life to me,
The life the tameless breakers know,
And freely, proudly, joyously,
I come to thee, O Sea !

E.C.
Three miners in the recently flooded
Union coal-mine, Gloucester, England, were
rescued after five days’ incarceration in a dead
end drive, from which the compressed air had
kept back the flood-water. A miner was recovered
under similar circumstances, 30 years ago, from
the dead end of a drive in one of the mines on the
Hustler’s line of reef, Bendigo.
A Myall Tragedy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The horses stumbled wearily, with drooping
heads, through the trembling heat of the January
sun. On either side and behind was the big,
scalded plain. Ahead a stony rise swelled slowly
from it. They were approaching one of the brief,
blind creeks of Centralia, which, after a course of
a mile or two, exhaust themselves in sand, or
merge into a tiny swamp.
“Our last chance ever to see the ‘Springs’
again—the horses are done, ” said the bigger man.
“ Your fault, anyhow,” snapped the other.
“I know—l know. But who could have guessed
that the damned hole would have been dry—ah
hold him, Jim ! ”
Picking their steps through a break-away close
to the creek, they had ridden on either side of a
blackfellow crouched beneath a steeper piece of
the bank. Bringing his whip-handle down, before
hi 3 startled and snorting horse had shied, the
speaker had sent the aborigine reeling against his
companion. He, in turn, had seized him by the
hair, and, pulled from the saddle, was rolling with
his antagonist in the gully. The bigger man soon
settled matters.
“ What’s the good of him now we have got him
Harry ? ” asked the other.
“Good of him! Why, we’ll make the beggar
take us to water, of course. Where the devil d’ye
suppose he gets a drink? You look after the
horses ; I’ll attend to him.”
The captive was forced up the steep bank, and
a little further, to where a few scattered and
stunted trees gave a scanty shade. To these, the
riding-horses were hung up. Then Harry turned
his attention to the captive, whom he had tied to
a tree.
Now, old man,” he said, “ you take me alonga
water ? ”
“Noulman utik longa wall?” repeated the
myall.
No use, said Harry, “ the beggar knows no
English. I’ll try him with some of the ‘line’
lingo ”
But the result was the same. Futile attempt at
repetition.
Then the big man went down on his stomach
and imitated the motion of drinking, pointing
then in different directions and with raised eye-
brows. A look of understanding stole into the
myall’s staring and frightened eyes.
“ Mukka ! ” he gasped. “ Mukka ! ” with other
words, which they did not understand.
“He does understand you, Harry,” cried the
smaller man. “The blacks on the ‘line’ sav
‘ Mukka ’ for ‘ No, ’ and ”
“Oh, shut-up,” growled Harry; “All the
niggers on this side say that. But he does under-
stand and won’t tell. I’m going to make him ! ”
He took a stirrup-leather, and walking up to
his victim, commenced flogging him, but with no
trace of anger or haste—and scientifically picking
out the tenderest places. But the shivering and
wailing nigger still refused to make any sign of
acquiescence. To take these awful white men—
of whom, before, he had only heard—and their
strange beasts to water would mean the loss of the
only supply on which the rump of his tribe de-
pended. The long drought had driven them far
to the eastward, and the water-hole was their last
chance. And so, stubbornly, he endured the
torment. “Wish there was an ants’-nest about,”
said Harry. “Saw off a small piece of that junk,
Jim.”
On getting the brine-soaked beef from the pack
he forced open the myall’s mouth and pushed it
in, afterwards gagging him with a handkerehief.
Then, still bound, he was laid on his back in the
sun—and kept there.
One —two hours passed.
“We’ll try our dusky friend again,” said the
stronger spirit. “ He’ll probably be more amen-
able to reason now.”
And the blackfellow, being hauled up, answered
the former sign-question by pointing to the north-
west with a trembling hand.
“We’re right now,” said Harry. “Get the
horses and I’ll lead him with the thong of the
stockwhip.”
In an hour they had topped the rise, to be con-
fronted by an equally slow descent. Away to
the north-west towered a high rock or small, steep
hill with a bare and stony side. And within a
mile of this ran a low, black line of scrub.
“Soak over there,” nodded the giant.
Another two hours passed, and then the quick
eyes of the half-fainting black saw something.
He yabbered, and they pulled up. Nodding and
talking, he faced round to the scrub now on their
left.
“Oh, no, you don’t—you black devil!” cried
the old hand. “Jim, keep your eyes skinned.
He’s got some relatives over in the timber. Touch
him up with your whip.”
In another half-hour Harry had spotted several
blacks’ tracks, and they stopped to secure the
loose packhorses. The wisdom of this was evident
in a few minutes more, when they had much to
do to prevent the lot from racing, as they smelt
the water. It was a native well, sunk under the
great face of rock, and with a pitiably small sup-
ply for the owners of the dark eyes that watched
them from the adjacent cover.
After the horses had had a drink and the kegs
and bags were filled, Jim said: “And now we’d
better give this poor devil a drink, and let him
go ; he deserves it.”
The big man laughed. “ And let him bring his
tribe down on us—if they haven’t spotted us
already. There’s an easier way out of tne trouble
than that;” and he stepped up to the gasping
myall and blew his brains out.
“ What a damnable thing to do,’’said the other.
“You’re soft yet, my boy—you’re soft yet.
Now, d’ye see, we’ll stop till sundown, give the
horses another drink, and go back a few miles and
camp in the open. In the morning come back and
give them a day’s spell. That’ll about finish the
water. Start to-morijow night and get to the
Yellow Waterholes—if we nave any luck; they
lie about nor’-east by east from here.”
“But don’t these wells make water?” asked
Jim.
“ Not an inch a month in a time like this.”
After dark, leaving a firo, the two stole silently
back into the open.
It wa,s half-an-hour before dawn. The sharp
chink of distant hobbles was occasionally to be
heard. Otherwise only the snoring of the big
man, who lay upon his back. The other slept as
lightly as a baby. Suddenly he moaned and
moved a little. At the instant a dozen figures
rose out of the ground, and as many spears sang.
He hardly moved. But big Harry—pinned by
two in his body and one through the side of th*
neck—tore them out of the ground as he sat up
with a horrible, moaning roar.
“You black devils!” he i quavered. “Jim,
Jim ! ” and groped for his revolver.
An instant the myalls hesitated before this
bellowing voice—so unlike anything they had
heard before. Then a young buck, lately made a
man—a full-blown aboriginal citizen—and anxious
to display his valor, bounded up and smashed his
waddy into the giant’s face. He dropped back,
and, for a moment, the bass notes became a keen
and squalling whimper. Then he was the centre
of a ring of yelling savages. And the waddies
did the rest.

CECIL POOLE.
The River and its Children.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The man—sick to death of “pleasure’’—had gone
down to the wharf.
He leant against one of the posts and looked
into the black, oozing flow of water, lit by ghostly
wharf lights that seemed as long slender candles
set around a catafalque. The ships lay very quiet
at their moorings, and the river might have been
a river of the dead save when the ferry-boat
silently crossed in answer to a hail over the water.
As the gloomy craft painfully dragged itself
over, the lights on the water were broken by the
wavelets, and spread themselves, like ghastly
smiles over the face of the dead. The man stood
for a long time looking, until the pain had left his
head and the thoughts passed through his brain as
easily as the black river slipped past its banks.
“God!” he muttered —“this can’t go on!
I’m deathly tired of it —it must come to the river
at last. There’s Carter and Deverall —they went
my road—and they came to it! ”
* * * m
The man saw a woman leaning against
a heap of boxes. The cold electric light showed
her face white and tired, with a ghastly truth.
He knew her for the woman she was, for the
street is not kind to its wives, and brands them
unpleasantly. She had dropped the smile of
street welcome, and her face had fallen into the
lines of a tired woman, old in folly and wisdom.
The man as he watched felt pity stir in his
heart; he knew their kinship, and the blame that
belonged to both, but which was all hers to bear.
He felt that, like tired children, they had crept
to the banks of memory and there together had
seen the way to forgetfulness.
He approached her gently and pushed into her
hand all the money he had ; it was the only form
of sympathy he had learnt. Then he walked
quickly down the lonely wharf with a strange
flush of pleasure.
9 9 0 9
The woman at his approach had forced into her
face the smile-professional—but as he walked
away it became again grey and old.
She looked at the money in her hand. “Oh,
my God ! ” she sobbed. “Has it come to that!
Have I become such a miserable hag that a man
pities me ! ”
And to her, too, the river seemed then to be
very near.

We All Use It
Keep Medicine on Hand. Don’t Wait till Sickness Comes.
Treat the Disease Early and Cure Promptly. Keep Well.
Mr. Wm. Allen, Police Constable of North Carlton, Victoria, sends a photo-
graph of his family and says: # .
“ For many years we have never been without Ayer’s Sarsaparilla m tho
house. When any of us are feeling poorly, just a few doses will make us all
right; My wife says it is a grand medicine for children, especially when they
are growing fast. She finds it of great benefit, herself, when she gets tired
and worn out from overwork. The same
medicine cured me once of a severe
liver complaint, pain through the kid-
neys, and impure blood.”

Mr. Allen should certainly he proud of his family. And he shows good
judgment in keeping Ayer’s Sarsaparilla always in the house. He knows it
gives bright eyes to the children, makes them have a clear and smooth skin,
brings good color to the cheeks and lips, and gives them the hearty appetite so
necessary to a substantial growth and development. ,
Don’t make the mistake of experimenting with some other Sarsaparilla.
All other Sarsaparillas are sold because they are said to be like Ayer’s.
