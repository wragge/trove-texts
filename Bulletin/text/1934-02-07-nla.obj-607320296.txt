OVERLOADING INCORRECT DISTRIBUTION WRONG GEAR RATIOS
Truck troubles such as those depicted above
are as inexcusable as they are expensive.
The Reo Slide Plan of truck selection
eliminates the guesswork responsible for
such misfits, and assures you of the right
truck for every job.
Working hand in hand with the copyrighted
slide rule is the Reo Ability Rating System,
an exclusive Reo development that tells
buyers what any truck will haul economically
under varying conditions; what its loaded
speed will be on the level highways; what
grade it will pull in top gear fully loaded.
Behind this scientific, up-to-the-minute plan
of selling by selection rather than by guess,
is a line of trucks and speedwagons that has
never been surpassed in excellence, even by
Reo. At the most economical prices in Reo
history, Reo offers Gold Crown Engines and
many superiorities not available in other
trucks at any price.
Phone your nearest distributor and arrange
for a demonstration, or write for full par-
ticulars and free literature.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement, columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

“Dreadful People”
That admirably judicial Englishman
P. G. Hamerton wrote of his fellow-
countrymen: “They are eminently con-
temptuous, even within the limits of their
own island.” In Hamerton’s time Eng-
land had “the ships and the money, too” ;
now foreigners have them. But the Eng-
lish can still enjoy pleasures of scorn
which are based on other grounds. The
whole nation is in a position to despise
America, which, oh the authority of its
own talkies, is inhabited by half-wits,
many of whom speak a travesty of the
English language and are dominated by
illiterate racketeers.
Many wealthy Britons attribute the de-
plorable morals of the Americans to the
fact that they are not governed by gentle-
men. These social students believe, with
Australia’s recent visitor Sir John Allen,
M.P., that “the word ‘graft’ is almost un-
known in England because English poli-
tical traditions were formed centuries ago
by landowners”—men of family to whom
the mere thought of nepotism, place-hunt-
ing, borough-mongering or any other
form of political corruption was abhor-
rent. Britons like Sir John hold to the
theory that the golden age of their coun-
try ended, politically, with the first
Reform Act, which took the reins of
government from incorruptible squires
like Walpole and handed them to Social-
ists. “However, even English Socialists,”
Sir John admitted in Sydney, “in nine
cases out of ten show the same hatred of
shady practices as Conservatives.” Their
trouble is that, though often honest, they
are rarely gentlemen. They, drop their
“h’s,” wear the wrong clothes, and in
other ways provide material for the satir-
ists of “Punch.”
In “Time Remembered” a letter sent
from Westgate 35 years ago by the auto-
biographist Lady Horne to Sir Edward
Burne-Jones is quoted. She refers to “the
little hot red villas swarming with dread-
ful people,” and he replies sympatheti-
cally: “I know the rancid red houses and
1 know my countrymen.” G. B. Stern’s
latest novel The Augs (Heinemann ; 7s.
6d.) deals with English people of that
class. It is interesting to compare it with
Don Chicago (Heritage; Dymock’s;
7s. 6d.), by C. E. Bechofer Roberts.
Trippers
Clifford’s Bay, which is invaded every
summer by holiday-makers, is another
Westgatef The residents—other than
boarding-house keepers and the like-
dread the approach of August and its
hordes of vulgar Cockneys. In the case
of the Leighs hatred of Augs has become
an obsession. When Colonel Leigh was
a boy his brother Hugh insisted on play-
ing with three Augs and was drowned.
The Leigh children have been segregated
from Augs all their lives, and conse-
quently have Augs on the brain. Sheila
Leigh imagines with a delicious shudder
what it must be like to be the pier photo-
grapher’s daughter “who saw Atigs every
day, crowds of Augs, who mingled with
Augs, touched them!”
Cousin Nellie, an old maid, arrives to
stay, and (horror!) becomes friendly with
a female Aug of her own age.
The most amusing and mercilessly
drawn character in the book is poor Cap-
tain Leigh, whose “principal illusion was
that he was inarticulate like soldiers and
Englishmen and explorers.” Whimsical
modesty is his line.
“I know I’m not much of a chap to look
at,” and then followed some rather dreadful
jesting about his 100k5.... When he stopped
playing [the piano] he was wont to say, laugh-
ing at himself, how awful his thumping was,
and how decent the family was in putting up
with it. “Though I expect they cry ‘Thank
God for small mercies’ the moment I’m out of
the room. In a way though, when you’re
a bit of a crock like me, it’s a great solace”..
He gets engaged to an entertainer at
the principal hotel, and is cut out by a
lively young Aug, a relation of Cousin
Nellie’s deplorable friend.
At this stage Mrs. Stern spoils it all by
introducing a grisly tragedy which, in
addition to being
out of harmony
with the gay tone
of the story, is un-
convincing, psy-
chologically and
otherwise. Still
it’s an unusually witty and perceptive
novel, and a reliable treatise on the atti-
tude of many members of the British
middle-classes towards their social in-
feriors.
Anti-A mericanism
The author of Don Chicago hasn’t been
such a poor propagandist as to put his
gangster forward as a credible American.
This despicable creature, who has been
exiled to effete England by better and
braver racketeers on the ground that he
would pollute any city in his native land,
has a Sancho Panza in the form of a
movie-mad small boy, and he tilts at
barrels of tar belonging to the Surrey
County Council in the belief that they
contain hooch. But he is near enough to
nature, as Cervantes’ hero was, to serve
his creator’s purpose. His galootish be-
havior laughs America’s intelligence
away. When the heroine tells him that
her father is chief constable of the county
he demands an introduction. “If he’s the
police chief, I gotta hook up with him.
I gotta see him to put in the fix, see. He’ll
have to work with me.” Murder, black-
mail, anything of that kind he is ready
for at a moment’s notice. But he draws
the line at outspoken conversation. “It
gets me sore,” he tells the lady novelist
at Lady Vanessa’s house-party, “the
things those guys talked about, just as if
dames wasn’t around” ; and his senti-
mentalism is sickening.
In short, he is a slightly exaggerated
version of the kind of American-
ignorant, provincial, violent, vainglorious,
tender to children, women and, above all,
mothers —who has figured as hero in
hundreds of Hollywood films about
gangsters, captains of industry, Wild West
pioneers and so on. His boorish and
criminal ways are contrasted with Eng-
lish reticence, English culture, English
respect for law and order, English com-
monsense. Many of the English people
he comes across are absurd, but they are
lovably absurd like the Leighs of Clif-
ford’s Bay.- With all their faults they are
the products of an old and aristocratic
civilisation. This is the light Englishmen
such as Lord Birkenhead’s biographer
love to see themselves in relatively to
Americans, who, since the Armistice, have
been the Augs of Europe.
If there is one kind of foreign criticism
that Imperialists resent more than an-
other it is American sneers at British
methods in India. Don Chicago meets an
Indian in London:
This nigger’s a victim of tyranny and oppres-
sion. And how! Them Britains .don’t know
how to handle colored f01k5.... If niggers tries
to pull things that ain’t right in America, like
trying to bunk in a white man’s hotel, we
sling ’em out. If they do it again, well, maybe
we lynch ’em, and if their families raise a
squawk we lynch them too. Niggers appreciate
that; they know they’re being used right. But
these Great Britains, what do they do? They
treats these niggers of theirs like they was
white.
There are many effective digs of the sort,
and the whole thing is uproariously
funny. With a good English cast, and
someone like Chester Morris as Don
Chicago, it should make a film-comedy
in a thousand.

Odyssey of an Art Critic
Art in My Time, by Frank Rutter
(Rich and Cowan ; Rawson’s, Melb. ; 75.),
is interesting as the unconscious auto-
biography of an art critic who is a Great
Authority in England, who has for over
30 years been in a position to make or
break the reputations of painters, and
who frequently passes judgment on Aus-
tralian aft purchases. After careful peru-
sal of his opus I have come to the con-
clusion that he is one of those fortunate
individuals to whom God has given the
capacity of getting gloriously drunk on
gingerpop.
It is this faculty that has given him
his eminence in the art world. For, un-
fortunately, more gingerpop is produced
by artists in any era than firewater, and

gingerpop must therefore be the mainstay
of the professional critic whose vogue
depends upon the degree to which he can
reflect the enthusiasms of the moment.
Mr. Rutter’s critical progress has been
a series of emotional explosions in front
of every conceivable variety of paintings.
Nowhere does he reveal the faintest
indication of having an objective cri-
terion. At one period he is intensely ex-
cited by Whistler’s “patterns.” Then he
becomes equally agitated by the French
impressionists. Everybody began to talk
about “atmosphere” in those days.
“Atmosphere” became the one desidera-
tum in a picture. Then Van Gogh came
along with his flat designs and heavy
lines to prove that atmosphere in a work
of art could be superfluous.
Came the close of the ’nineties. “It was
whispered that there was a ‘simply mar-
vellous’ student at the Slade whose draw-
ings were those of a master.” This
phenomenon was Augustus John, whose
“heads and studies in pencil and chalks
were indeed amazing and, before he
showed that he could paint, enthusiasts
spoke of him as a coming Rubens.” Just
as John threatened to become boring,
along came M. Picasso, who had “more
inventive resourcefulness” than the great
Augustus.
Mr. Rutter was next knocked off his
balance by Monet, Manet and others of
the Barbizon school, whom he calls the
“luminists.” His restless, almost febrile
ability to appreciate anything was shortly
afterwards satisfied by Renoir and Degas.
No sooner had he settled down to them
than Percy Wyndham Lewis blew him
sky-high with “a whirling design of
slightly cubist forms expressed in terms
of cool but striking color contrasts.”
And so on, and so on, through pages
peppered with the names of Epstein, Eric
Gill, John and Paul Nash, McKnight
Kauffer, William Rothenstein and a hun-
dred others; and bedizened with such
phrases as “sheer beauty,” “significant
form,” “high originality,” “rhythm,”
“harmony of color,” “decorative arrange-
ment,” and all the conventional claptrap
which any competent reporter on a daily
could pick up in five minutes if an art
show were included in his assignment.
Now, what does all this mean? Simply
that Mr. Rutter has a real interest in and
love of art, but not a notion of what art
is or what is the subject-matter of the
painter, nor any direct knowledge of the
reality with which a painter deals—
color, tone and form —to govern his en-
thusiasms.
The critic who lacks this knowledge
is the prey of every new fashion. The
fact that he has a battery of words
and phrases to fit every picture means
nothing. Unless he has a logical aesthetic
his use of such words as “subtlety,”
“beauty,” “unity” or “significance”
means no more than the expressions
which a hodcarrier might emit in front
of the same paintings. Take the word
“unity.” If any part of nature is cut off
and contemplated apart from its sur-
roundings it will reveal a unity due to
the laws of the light with which it is
illuminated. If a painter interprets those
laws aright then his picture will reveal
a similar unity. To speak of unity in
other terms is to speak of a man-made
convention ; and, as man-made conven-
tions change almost as rapidly as the
seasons, what is regarded as unity in one
period will be regarded as disintegration
in another.
This is the secret of Mr. Rutter’s con-
stant enthusiasms and equally constant
disappointments. It never seems to have
occurred to him that, unless there is some
universal criterion, this year’s hat will
always seem fetching and last year’s
dowdy. In the galaxy of talent that he
mentions there is scarcely a painter who
has not become old-fashioned in his life-
time.

the degeneration of present-day painting given
by J. S. McDonald (R.P. 24/1/’34) is stagger-
ing, coming as it does from the director of
one of Australia’s leading art institutions. Mr.
McDonald would have us believe that modern
art is the product of a conspiracy between
incompetent women and what he calls
“pansies.” Actually, modern art began with
Cezanne, a clumsy but sincere practitioner
who acquired the usual disgust of the real
artist for the academic conventions of his day.
The artists that followed —by far the majority
of them were males—turned his blunders into
a new set of conventions, and so the slide
to vulgarity began. But the academic art
which they endeavored to replace was just
as vulgar. The only difference was that its
vulgarity was stodgy, traditional.
What actually is the process by which pic-
torial artists are produced? Young men and
women or their parents look around for a
reputable teacher, and having no means of
judging who are the good and who the bad
they usually go to the recognised academies,
such as are maintained by most of our national
galleries. These academies are invariably strong-
holds of conservatism whose methods haven’t
changed for centuries. Here the students, male
and female, are put through the same mechani-
cal grind. They are made to draw in charcoal
from casts or life —Mr. McDonald emphasises
the importance of drawing, like a good aca-
demician. Having duly qualified in this foolish
exercise, they are allowed to start painting still-
life or figures. But their eyes have already
become perverted through being compelled to
see Nature in terms of black lines on white
paper, which are not the terms in which Nature
reveals herself at all. So the unfortunate vic-
tims of academic orthodoxy are in a muddle
from the start.
To make matters worse, periodical competi-
tions are held, and prizes and scholarships are
awarded. As the judges are their own teachers,
the prizes invariably go to the students who most
faithfully reproduce the false conventions of the
school. For a simple reason these students
are almost invariably girls. Girls tend to
idolise their masters. They express it by imi-
tation. With monotonous regularity one girl
after another wins the travelling scholarship at
the National Gallery in Melbourne, and goes
off to' Europe, usually never to be heard of
again. Having learnt a worthless convention
which prevents further development once it has
been mastered, they throw art up in disgust,
follow some decorative craze or escape into
marriage and maternity. Some may indulge in
“modernism,” but why shouldn’t they?
Modernism is no more idiotic than the for-
mulas of the schools.
The young men also tend to idolise their
teachers, and they, too, come to the same dead-
end of academism. But it is more the nature
of males to want to rise above their masters;
so if they have sufficient courage and origin-
ality young men may do what all the significant
painters have done —tell their teachers to go
to blazes and cut their way through the jungle
themselves. But what usually happens is
that the male student becomes a respect-
able mediocrity, a revolte to modernism,
a commercial artist, a cartoonist or a cari-
caturist. Commercial art, cartooning and
caricaturing are the logical extensions of the
training of the schools.
So Mr. McDonald would be better advised
devising some method whereby the academies
could begin producing Manets, Millets, Corots,
Constables and Whistlers instead of driving
them from their doors. The assertion that
women “rule the world of art to-day, and
unless real painters speak up for themselves
and right art the women and their near-men
abettors will ruin both” is too funny for words.
As far as I know there are no women or near-
men teachers in our art academies.
Betty Martin in defence of her sex
and generation:
It is odd that Mr. McDonald should be so
upset over women’s lack of artistic integrity,
because even the big he-men painters of his
day often didn’t appear to have much con-
science when they painted the sort of pictures
one sees in the Sydney Art Gallery.
Modernist painters may be dreadful fellows,
but I don’t think all of them can really be
“pansies.” My boy-friend, who knows a lot of
artistic people, went to a party in London
where he saw Mr. John and Mr. Epstein. He
told me when I showed him Mr. McDonald’s
article that he wouldn’t have cared—or dared —
to walk up to either of them and say “Pansy”
for fear of what might have happened to him.
Mr. Epstein, he said, looked particularly dan-
gerous, and what could be more modernist than
Mr. Epstein?
I don’t really care what Mr. McDonald thinks
about his fellow-men, because that is their
business, but I am sorry he thinks so badly
of us girls. Of course, if he only objects to
the ones who paint pictures it isn’t so sad,
because we all have our likes and dislikes.
My boy-friend doesn’t much like girls who
sing early-Victorian ballads, and I don’t much
like dunderheaded art critics. Besides, they are
not often so good-looking as men who swim in
surf carnivals.
However, I feel sure they all have their uses
if one only knew.
Of course, if Mr. McDonald knew about
Modern Art he would know it is not meant to
look like the pictures we had given to us on
our Sunday-school texts, and if he knew about
women he would know that nice girls look
much the same in any kind of fashions, how-
ever unbecoming they may appear to those
in what I have heard called the sere and
yellow.
I can’t help thinking that Mr. McDonald
is suffering from a blighted life, and if some
good-natured girl would only take him in
hand he would remember that his mother and
sisters were women, too, and not get so cross
because some of the others have perhaps been
more successful than he has at painting pic-
tures. Perhaps some day some gifted woman
will paint a beautiful modern picture of him,
and then he will be more sympathetic, because
often they look much nicer than the old-
fashioned, stag-at-bay kind of portrait which
is painted of most elderly gentlemen.
Mrs. Bernard Muscio writes as a Femi-
nist :
The crippling disadvantage against which
women struggle was well illustrated in Mr. J.
S. McDonald’s hymn of hate.
(1) Women cannot draw.
(2) Women painters don’t even know the names
of the very few good women artists.
(3) Even if women support a movement it is
men who bear away the palm.
(4) A method favored by women is thereby
shown to be bad.
(5) Women have no artistic consciences.
If many men think as Mr. McDonald does,
then women need enormous courage to oppose
such bias and express themselves at all. The
world (i.e., men, who control the money and
the power) thunders so loudly at women to
become silly and parasitical that any who resist
deserve admiration. The first courage asked
of them is the tragic risk of cutting themselves
off from love and material security. Such is
not the psychological background for creative
art. Yet women have been creative artists in
various fields.
Bertrand Russell, a student of human nature,
as Mr. McDonald is not, writes in “Marriage
and Morals”:
The revolt of women against the domination of
men is a movement which in its purely political
sense is practically completed, but in its wider
aspects is still in its infancy.... The emotions
even that women are supposed to feel, for example,
are still as yet a reflection of the interests and
sentiments of men.... So long as women were in
subjection they did not dare to be honest even about
their own emotions, but professed those which were
pleasing to the male.
Most women are still man-moulded in a
man-made world. Their “inane modishness,”
censured by Mr. McDonald, is fastened on them
as was the bound foot on the Chinese woman,
and the economic dependant takes pride in
extremes of fashion as the Chinese woman did
in her crippling.
According to Mr. McDonald, women do not
want stability. It is impossible for this to
be known until most women have real free-
dom ; and not until then should anyone dog-
matise about what women can or cannot do.
The Edwardian Spree
George Robey in Looking Back on Life
(Constable ; 7s. 6d.) embodies the sump-
tuous Edwardian interlude. Sixty-five
this year, he witnessed its alcoholic and
spendthrift beginnings and is one of its
ripest admirers.
An actor who takes to writing is at a
loss ; his job is sound and fury, not the
silent printed word. But Robey manages
to transfer his rich, garrulous noise, his
glib loudness, to the paper. He rips on
and on, is funny at times, flops at times,
wallows in the cliches his audiences expect,
and creates an impression of flamboyant
speed. His book, though all to pieces in
technique and literary shape, is yet the
spoken word, the shouted word in print;
he writes as he works and thinks. The
strong overtone of egomania is as it
should be, too ; no modest violet could
succeed in his job. The celebrities that
he touches in passing are not much more
than “dear old W. Blank” or “that ster-
ling actress Jenny Dash.” One looked
for “that reliable trouper H. Irving,” but
he stopped there.
How his oddly “West End” voice, his
driving personality, the vinous guffaws
which he inspired come back!
A lugubrious, red-nosed figure in a
shabby frock coat and topper is narrating
his domestic worries to a jaunty accom-
paniment. “And I Live Underneath” is
his theme, and the name of his song. He
details the indignities to which he is sub-
jected. “A nd they look through a hole in
the roof at me” he snaps bitterly, and sud-
denly bends over and applies his eye to
the floor. Howls of delight from the
audience.
He was always the star of his pro-
gramme, a tower of vulgar health and
sanity. No narrow artistic fire ever
bothered him, no haggard Dan-Leno
touch of strange genius, no Little-Tich
deformity ; like the interlude he is large
(or seems so: actually he is short and
nuggety) and overpowering, teeming with
cloacal jokes, ripe with loud contempt of
the Victorian secrecies. Amid the welter
of the Edwardian spree he stands out as
vividly as a Sairey Gamp and Falstaff did
in other eras.
But his vision is all to pot. On every
page he cries for the moon. The old
music-hall with its lashings of drink and
patrolling demi-mondaines has gone—
never to return.
Say in its favor that, with the aid
of people like Robey and Marie Lloyd,
it laughed away the piano trouser-legs
and similar idiocies, and cleared the way
to the sharpest reality in history. That
job being done, the rest, so far as the
old intimate bleary music-hall is con-
cerned, can well be silence.
H. L.
A Satchel of Books
The tales in Australian Legends, by C.
W. Peck (Lothian ; 7s. 6d.), are good—
among Binghi’s best —but the writer isn’t
a good story-teller. His style is halting
and uncertain, and the continual use of
scientific names for flowers and birds
doesn’t make him any easier to read.
Ramsay’s Architectural and Engineer-
ing Specifications, Vol. I. (Ramsay Pub-
lishing Pty., Ltd., Melb.; 10s.), is the first
work on the subject based on Australian
building practice. Invaluable information
on the methods of assembling, writing
and presentation of specifications is con-
tained in the first part, and in the second
part there are 3000 or more paragraphs
and clauses giving accurate descriptions
of materials and workmanship in the
architectural and structural engineering
trades. The binding permits the addition
of separate filings. No architect or
builder should be without it.
Time Remembered, by Frances Horner
(Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.). Lady Horner has
had an interesting life, lived among
famous people, and in this book she
chats pleasantly about it and them. As
the Irish parson-wit George Birming-
ham points out in a preface, she has
adopted an unusual autobiographical
form. Instead of proceeding chronologi-
cally she dodges here and there, giving
40 pages to Burne-Jones (the Pre-
Raphaelites were her intimate friends),
shorter chapters to such men as Haldane,
Morley and Asquith, and stray items
about people whose only claim to notice
is that she happened to like them.
Godfrey Webb was a London man of fashion.
He endeared himself to all my children.
He would take them to the Zoo or for long
walks in London. Once he said: “Now I will
show you how loudly I can scream in Bond-
street and no one will take any notice.” He
suddenly emitted a piercing shriek, recomposed
his face instantly, and went gravely on.
She seems to have had a knack of re-
cruiting such likeable eccentrics from
all walks of life.

THE BEAST BREAKS LOOSE.
“In race riots at Kalgoorlie, mobs looted and fired hotels and shops and, after a pitched battle in which two lives were lost, drove foreign miners off the leases,
burning their homes. Most of the foreigners, men, women and children, fled to the bush without food, water or shelter from the fierce midsummer sun.”

THE MOB TAKES CHARGE.
A goldfields mob has added a black
chapter to the history of Westralia, so
much of which may be contemplated with
pride. Mobs are invariably stupid and
are apt to be fiendishly cruel, but, with
rare exceptions, Westralian experience
was previously confined to the merely
stupid sort. In 1898 a Kalgoorlie-Boul-
der mob hustled John Forrest —the
greatest man his State has produced, and
the best friend the goldfields have had—
because of his refusal to address them on
the alleged grievances of a parcel of fos-
sickers who had taken possession of a
lease which was being mined by a com-
pany for a reef, although the law had
decided that they had no right there.
Feeling died down as far as Forrest was
concerned, but it flamed up again at the
expense of C. J. Moran, his ablest fol-
lower, who was driven out of public life.
The war led to uglier scenes on the
Golden Mile and at Fremantle. The con-
scription argument split the Labor party
and many of the trade-unions, and the
pro-conscription miners on the Golden
Mile formed an organisation of their own.
After repeated threats of violence, anti-
conscription miners, led by a ruffian who
afterwards served a long sentence for
robbery under arms (in the dock he
called it “propaganda by deed”), tried to
drive the conscriptionists off the leases, but
were repulsed. A similar affray at Fre-
mantle, where a loyalist union of wharf-
lumpers had been set up after the 1917
strike, resulted in a triumph for the
attackers, who captured the wharves and
dictated terms to the panic-stricken Gov-
ernment of the day. In the melee one of
their number had been knocked on the
head, and the terms included the with-
drawal of the police from Fremantle and
the stoppage of Government trams and
trains while the funeral was in progress.
Bad as the Fremantle business was, the
outrages witnessed at the goldfields capi-
tal last week were immeasurably worse.
For two nights the district was given over
to the frenzy of an unwhipped mob, in-
spired by hatred of foreigners and, in
many cases, maddened with drink. Since
1898 or thereabouts, Italians have con-
gregated at the southern end of Kalgoor-
lie’s main thoroughfare, Hannan-street.
They had their headquarters in the Home
from Home Hotel, the All Nations board-
ing-house (itself formerly a tavern) and
a wine saloon. On Sunday night there
was a fight between an Australian fire-
man and art Italian barman from the
hotel. A blow felled the fireman, whose
head came in contact with the pavement;
his skull was fractured and he died. The
barman was arrested and charged with
manslaughter.
On Monday night a crowd gathered in
front of the hotel. After a bombardment
with stones, which broke most of the win-
dows, the place was stormed. There was
no resistance, the occupants having made
themselves scarce, and the stormers, who
were mostly young fellows, worked their
will on the liquor, furniture, fittings and
cash register, the contents of which, one
narrative says, were “eagerly pounced
upon as they rolled into the gutter.” The
hotel gutted, the mob looted and fired
the wine saloon, and, when that was well
alight, they proceeded to burn down the
hotel, the boarding-house and a garage
which housed the hotelkeeper’s car. Fire-
men were forcibly prevented from sav-
ing burning buildings ; bottles and stones
were hurled at constables posted about
the wrecked hotel. Restaurants, fish-,
fruit- and tobacco-shops were also ran-
sacked and wrecked.
Its work of destruction accomplished
in Kalgoorlie, the mob commandeered
the tramcars which run out to Boulder,
three miles away, and resumed its looting
and firing there. Within an hour it had
ransacked and destroyed two hotels, three
shops and the International Club, return-
ing to Kalgoorlie laden with bottles of
beer and whisky, poultry and portable
furniture. Greeks and Jugo-Slavs, as well
as Italians, were among the sufferers.
There was no rioting in the day-time,
but on Tuesday night, after the funeral of
the ill-fated fireman and a mass meeting
of miners, at which it was demanded that
every foreigner should be dismissed from
the mines, there was a concerted attack
on southern Slavs camped on leases
to the east of Boulder. Lethal weapons
were used on both sides: rifles and
pistols, knives and improvised bombs.
One of the assailants was fatally knifed,
and six other Australians were wounded ;
one of the defenders, a Dalmatian, was
shot dead. In the end the foreigners gave
up the fight and their homes were given
to the flames. Most of them, men, women
and children, fled to the bush. It is a
treeless and waterless wilderness, and
they had no food, but to the fugitives,
though a midsummer sun blazed down
on them, it was less terrible than the
drink-crazed mob.
Where were the police all this time?
Making an arrest here and there, but that
was the most they could do. They
were hopelessly outnumbered by the
mob and its sympathisers; in all
Westralia there are not 600 policemen,
and had they been all assembled in
Kalgoorlie when the fury broke out they
would have been as one to thirty of £
population which has doubled itself in
four years. But why was not the Riot
Act read on Monday night, when
the mob was plainly out of hand, and
why were not special constables sworn in
at Kalgoorlie then, or on Tuesday morn-
ing, instead of at Perth on Wednesday?
Why were not the hotels and wineshops
closed during the day preceding the
attack on the poor wretches in Hessian
Town, instead of the day after?
If words could have calmed the tumult,
there were words enough. Premier Col-
lier issued an idiotic statement attribut-
ing “the outbreak of incendiarism and law-
lessness to the machinations of Com-
munists” —who, to give them their due,
not only preach but practise the inter-
nationalism to which Labor politicians
give lip-service. Two of his Ministers,
Mr. McCallum and Mr. Kenneally, arrived
at Kalgoorlie on Tuesday to talk to the
miners. Labor Ministers are always
ready to talk till the cows come home, but
they are pitiably weak in action. Action
was imperatively called for in this in-
stance, and it was not forthcoming.
Twenty-four hours elapsed between the
outbreak in Hannan-street and the in-
vasion of the Slav miners’ quarter, ample
time to prevent a recurrence of the riot-
ing and the destruction of life and
property; but no precautions worth a
rush were taken.
Even if it may be supposed that words
might have availed instead of deeds, it is
strange that it should have been left to
two comparative strangers from the coast
to' do the spouting. Where was Mr.
Munsie, the Minister of Mines, who re-
presents Hannans? Where was the
Premier himself, who represents Boulder?
One lesson of this lamentable affair is
that there is something more in the busi-
ness of government than passing 80 or
90 bills in a session and rushing to the
Loan Council during recess for temporary
accommodation. Also, there is something
wanting in a system which leaves com-
munities, property and institutions at the
mercy of any mob that young hoodlums
may gather round them. The Americans,
whose Constitution we copied in so many
respects, protect themselves against civil
commotion —which, when it takes the
form of unprovoked attacks on aliens,
may involve a country in war with a
foreign Power—by means of State
militia. We have no State militia. We
have only 1500 permanent soldiers and
8700 policemen to protect a population
of 6,600,000, spread over nearly three
million square miles. We allow foreigners
to come here, give them the right to join
unions and to become naturalised citizens,
and promise them the protection of our
laws. In the Kalgoorlie case the Labor
Government conspicuously failed to pro-
tect not only the foreign-born fathers and
mothers (some of the fathers served in
the A.1.F.) but the Australian-born chil-
dren ; failed in the first duty of a Gov-
ernment.
Westralia has hitherto been reckoned
as law-abiding a country as there is in
the world. One way of redeeming its
tarnished reputation would be to get
rid of this prating and putty-backed
Administration and replace it with a real
Government. The trouble with Govern-
ments like Collier’s is that they don’t
govern.
DOUGLAS AND LANG.
Major Douglas and Comrade Lang may
not be negotiating for a merger of in-
terests, as the “S. M. Herald” alleges;
but they should be. Each is a Great
Theorist. Each has become so tangled
up in a scheme of salvation that he does
not seem to understand it himself. Both
are now back-to-the-wall in corners of
the political alley, while a large common
following worships at a safe distance.
And both seem to be ready to accept
suggestions even from capitalists, and to
tolerate the system of the oppressors if
a large section of their common sup-
porters prefers it that way. They like
to oblige everybody.
The Douglas Credit Association, in its
methods, follows the Lang party, even
to the point of publishing in its official
organ a list of shops which Douglasites
should patronise.
When the programmes come to be
compared side by side —the “Declaration
and Demands” of the Douglas body
which “elucidates” its Australian pro-
gramme, and the plans of the Lang
party as set out in its. official. pamphlet
“The Socialisation of Credit” —it is hard
to tell them apart.
The first point in the Douglas state-
ment reads: —
Cruel and unnecessary poverty is being im-
posed on the people.... For all* fundamental
purposes, Finance has subjugated the elected
Government of Australia and reduced the
sovereign rights of the people to a sham.
The A.L.P. manifesto says that the
private banks operating in the interests of
High Finance have filched the sovereign rights
of the people.
The Douglas scheme goes on:
The changes necessary [i.e., “to allow the
people to enjoy higher standards of living com-
mensurate with greatly increased ability to pro-
duce goods and services”] are merely those
of financial method and policy. Bank
deposits and savings, the private control of
industry and property of shareholders, the daily
habits of the people and personal initiative
need not....be interfered with. Full use of
the Commonwealth Bank will be made to
finance the nation.
The Lang party says:
Labor will eliminate capitalist robbery and
plunder, but this does not mean that the indi-
vidual is to be deprived of personal property.
Labor’s policy does not involve expropriation
....it will not result in loss of deposits, which
will be transferred to the credit of depositors
in the Commonwealth Bank.
All credit for national undertakings,
including loan credit for local authorities
and pastoralists and manufacturers, will
be “debt-free” under the Douglas scheme.
So it will be under Lang’s socialisation
policy—the Commonwealth Bank will
issue it via the Notes Branch. Douglas’s
loans will be interest-free, whereas Lang
will merely reduce interest on mort-
gages ; but this is a small matter.
Douglas finds an outlet for his some-
thing-for-nothing complex, which is the
main ingredient in the mental outlook of
every successful mob leader, in a scheme
for a national dividend, to be paid over
and above earnings to every man, woman
and child. Lang gets at it another way
—widespread doles, child endowment,
bonuses for producers, tin-hare fran-
chises for Swindells, fruit-machine
licenses for Trautweins, and 7s. 6d.
a bushel for wheat. They amount to the
same thing, with a slightly more class-
conscious distribution ; and, either way,
the community has to pay for them and
pledge its credit to do it. Both saviours
intend to “increase the purchasing power
of the people.” Lang offers
increased purchasing power, bringing greater
volume of business results and reduced over-
head expenses and reduced burden of capital
costs.
And he will “stabilise prices to the pro-
ducer.”
Douglas proposes to “subsidise prices
to reduce them to consumers,” and at
the same time to guarantee producers
the “full cost of production and an
agreed margin of profit, while preventing
inflation and increasing purchasing power
of money.” It suggests that Douglas
is merely Dante the Magician come
among us in disguise.
Finally Lang and Douglas agree in
another important matter. Neither goes
into exact detail as to how his scheme
is to be carried out. The outstanding
feature of Douglas’s speeches in Aus-
tralia was his avoidance of the construc-
tive side of the questions which he raised.
He will leave the translation of his
words into reality to “experts.” The Lang
party, which a year ago was roaring for
confiscation and virtual Communism
and political control of everything, has
now been seized with the same idea. It
“will manage the credit resources of the
country through the most competent
executives” —“technicians,” who will re-
place the “inefficient amateurs” who are
“controlling banking affairs” to-day.
How many banks its “technicians” will
break in the process is not explained.
It is proposed that Douglas and Lang
should have a meeting before the major
returns to Scotland, there to pursue his
plan for giving every inhabitant of that
country, out of the “national dividend”
£3OO a year. By all means let the inter-
esting pair meet, and let Garden take
part in the palavers. Then there will be
three of a kind.
IRON-HORSE IMPERIALISM.
Lavrentieff, the Soviet agent in Eastern
Russia, recently delivered an address to
a party conference at Khabarovsk in
which he described the measures the Rus-
sian dictators are taking to counter
Japanese military preparations. Besides
erecting colossal factories, oil-refining
plants and repair plants for tractors, they
are rushing a new railway through from
Lake Baikal to the River Amur, duplicat-
ing 410 miles of the Trans-Siberian, and
building a fresh iron road from Irkutsk
towards the sunrise. These activities are
a retort to the projected assimilation of
the Chinese Eastern Railway by Man-
chukuo.
If that fresh, young, newly painted
State claims the Chinese Eastern Railway,
the voice will be the voice of Manchukuo,
the hand that of the Japanese army.
With the Japanese army in possession the
Soviet will be finally cut off from its
vast Eastern Maritime provinces and its
only considerable port in those parts,
Vladivostok. When a country is
separated by land and sea from any of
its possessions and has an aggressive
and ambitious neighbor, there are
usually “incidents” which warrant inter-
vention by the ambitious neighbor in the
interests of law and order. Several such
incidents have occurred recently. They
have appeared so sinister that Japanese
nationals have evacuated Vladivostok,
presumably under instructions.
The acquirement of the Chinese
Eastern Railway has been a long and
slow process. During the regime of the
Little Father, the guards were Russian,
the towns were indistinguishable from
similar outposts of Russian Imperialism
in Siberia, and there were strips of terri-
tory on each side of the rails which were
being settled by Russian peasants on
exactly the same lines as the Victorian
Government settles the Mallee. This
state of affairs was only possible because
China, the ostensible owner, was too
weak to do anything about it. The
recent change of management, whereby
Japan became the protector of Manchu-
kuo, so weakened the Russian position
that it can only have been fear of
international complications which pre-
vented Manchukuo turning the Slav out,
lock, stock and barrel. Instead, neces-
sity has been given a semblance of
legality by a series of acts which have
rendered the Russian management un-
workable. One of these was to arrest the
Russian staff on charges of bribery, cor-
ruption or incompetence.
Manchukuo has offered to buy the
C.E.R. Her price was £3,000,000 ; the
Soviet’s was, until recently, £40,000,000.
Possession of the line involves control of
the destinies of 30,000,000 industrious
Chinamen. The South Manchuria Rail-
way, run by the Japanese Government,
connects with the C.E.R. and is an inter-
esting subject for study. If the N.S.W.
railways commissioner managed that
State’s educational system, owned all its
largest factories, its hotel system, river
and overseas steamers, mines and police,
and had a large army at its call, the
analogy would be exact enough for ordi-
nary purposes.
In short, the conquest of Manchuria,
an area of 1,500,000,000 square kilo-
metres, by the C.E.R. and the S.M.R. is
an arresting example of a new technique
which might be called “iron-horse” Im-
perialism. The nomads of Jenghiz Khan
conquered all Asia and half of Europe
mounted on the backs of extremely
shaggy ponies, and they did it so rapidly
that before Jenghiz died provinces thou-
sands of miles away were overthrowing
their native oppressors with the aid of his
troops. The hordes of Jenghiz so stag-
gered Europe by the rapidity of their
movements and their habit of popping up
in unexpected places that it was imagined
that there were scores of armies and mil-
lions of soldiers. Actually the Mongol
armies were probably smaller than the
European ones, but, as they were all
mounted, their minimum speed was that
of their cavalry. The European generals,
as conservative as modern cavalry leaders,
mixed horse and infantry, and the steel-
clad mounted knight had to reduce his
pace to the maximum acceleration of the
footsloggers.
Conquest by railway slows the pro-
cess up to the pace set by the con-
struction engineers and the industrialists
who manufacture the material. The
seizure of Manchuria, although its clos-
ing scenes were spectacularly fast, actu-
ally occupied several generations. Some
day a country strongly equipped with
tanks and aeroplanes may repeat the feat
of Jenghiz, to the astonishment of the
military experts.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The New Dollar.
“The U.S.A. is on a gold bullion stan-
dard, 1934 model,” said Henry Morgen-
thau, Secretary to the U.S. Treasury,
when pressed to define the Roosevelt
dollar’s position amongst the world’s cur-
rencies. This is all the evidence so far
that U.S.A. is on any kind of a gold
standard, even a “1934 model.” Until
there is a free market for gold, and
paper currency is redeemable in gold
dollars or bullion, no gold standard
exists. The position of the dollar, there-
fore, has international financiers puzzled.
In one golden sovereign there is
roughly the gold content of eight 60-cent
gold dollars, as against 4.86 of the dollars
that Hoover knew. But instead of giving
eight of the new dollars for one gold
pound, international money-changers will
only give $7.85. Hence anyone who has
a debt to pay in New York finds it
cheaper to send gold. On the other hand,
such a boom is anticipated in U.S. stocks
and shares that there is a rush to buy
U.S. securities. The dollar is being pulled
and shoved between these violent move-
ments.
If, when all the tumult and the shout-
ing is over, the “1934 model gold bul-
lion standard” emerges as what the rest
of the civilised world knows as a gold
standard, there should undoubtedly be a
strong stimulation of American industries.
Unless forced further off the gold
standard, the purchasing-power parity of
other nations’ currencies will mean cheap
buying of U.S. commodities, and, though
a gradual rise in U.S. prices should follow
and wipe out this temporary advantage,
the U.S. debtor will eventually gain
something approaching the benefit of the
40 p.c. reduction in the gold value of the
dollar. Heavily mortgaged American
farms should particularly get a new lease
of life. This brings the new dollar clearly
into Australian perspective, especially as
regards our wheat farmers and our
growers of cotton and tobacco. And
further devaluation is talked of.
♦
Meat Developments.
The Angliss-Weddel merger, in conjunc-
tion with the entry of the Blue Star Line
into the Australian trade, is an important
development. The Angliss business is
substantially a one-man concern, and it
was feared in well-informed quarters that
it might fall into American hands. Wed-
dels, members of the Vestey group, are
British if nothing else ; and Vesteys, even
if they are suspect with sections of Aus-
tralian democracy,* have shown in Argen-
tina their capacity for developing the
chilled-beef trade with results which Aus-
tralia has had good cause to envy.
Their Blue Star ships set the world’s
standard for chilled meat and produce
carriage. They are the P. and O. and
Orient liners of the trade, and their in-
troduction suggests that their owners feel
the point to have arrived when the Com-
monwealth need no longer pit unpopu-
lar frozen meat against the popular
chilled product. We are, at last, to be
on equal terms with our competitors in
the meat business, and fruit shippers and
dairy exporters should benefit as well.
In certain quarters, the new moves are
being interpreted as an earnest that
Vesteys will reopen their million-pound
Darwin meatworks, which have been
lying idle in oil for over a decade. The
British firm, which leases some of the
finest pastoral country in the N.T. and
owns a quarter of a million cattle on
it, would no doubt like to get a little
barren interest back on its huge invest-
ment, but its experience, in common with
that of the rest of the pastoral industry
in the North, has been bitter.
The graziers are the only people who
have done any practical, permanent de-
velopment work in the Territory. They
have nevertheless been scourged by labor
unions and bled by Lands and Taxation
departments. Much of the development
was undertaken on promises given in
1923-24 of reforms in government and
relief from burdens. Canberra broke
faith with them, and the Administration
has gone from weakness to weakness.
The Government now has its oppor-
tunity to redeem its dead-letter contracts.
The reopening of Vesteys would mean,
directly and indirectly, work for a thou-
sand families or so in Darwin; but it
will not be achieved until a long-distance
policy of help and consideration for the
grazing industry is guaranteed. The Ter-
ritory needs a strong Administrator ; it
needs a policy framed by Territorians for
the Territory.
The New Vic. Curriculum.
Dear Bulletin, —As a warm admirer of
The Bulletin for over 40 years, I feel
it my duty to put you right concerning
Victoria’s revised curriculum for State
schools (B. 31/1 / ’34).
May I first condole with “F.S.” for
having just missed achieving 100 p.c. of
misrepresentation? His one accurate
statement is that “Mr. Mcßae wants chil-
dren to be allowed to develop self-expres-
sion and individuality.”
Let us smite his inaccuracies seriatim:
(a) The plan is neither wholly new, nor mine,
nor amorphous, nor Daltonian. It is the result
of co-operative effort from teachers (State and
registered), inspectors and administrative officers,
and embodies the best that our progressive
teachers have been doing for some years.
( b ) Textbooks will still find a place, but a
strictly subordinate one. The aim throughout
will be to secure a return to reality. The pro-
ject method, as exemplified in the work of
Young Farmers’ Clubs, will be followed in all
subjects. The Melbourne press is making this
possible by the publication each week of speci-
ally written articles on the new work.
(c) Self-government—within reasonable limits
—is one of our objectives. So far from being
unattainable, it is already a fait accompli in
many schools.
(d) The Victorian teacher is not “a badgered
individual.” Contra, the new course allows
greater scope than ever before for the teacher’s
initiative and originality.
(e) Purchased “apparatus” is not a requisite
—its use is actually discouraged.
(/) The conjunction of “F.S.’s” reference to
“character-building” and his “readiness to bet”
is an illuminating instance of the coherence and
consistency of his argument.
(g) The old examination system is not being
retained. The qualifying examination has been
abolished, and the written examination for merit
certificate restricted to mathematics and Eng-
lish. Further, nearly 70 p.c. of these certi-
ficates are now awarded, without examination,
on the head teachers’ reports.
The best answer to the charge of im-
practicability is that even now, before the
ink is dry on the printed courses, many
schools have already advanced beyond
the new prescriptions.
With a team of teachers capable of this,
what director would ask for a staff of
“Montessoris'and Russells”? —Yours etc.,
— J. Mcßae, Director.

Back to Coonabarabran.
They are having a Back-to-Coonabara-
bran Week at the end of February, and
hundreds of drovers, graziers and other
old inhabitants will soon be on their way
to join the 7000 people who inhabit the
shire, which spreads itself out over the
Castlereagh country.
Not much happens in Coonabarabran
that the world ever hears of; but it has
a loyal spirit, and for more than a hun-
dred years has been breeding Australians
about a couple of yards long who have
no time for Reds (they know all about
Reds in Binnaway), and who in every
new generation raise sheep which cut a
bit more wool and help to pay a bit more
income tax.
All in all, the atmosphere has not
changed much since “old John Bax”
drove the mail,
With his reins all made of greenhide
And his whip of kangaroo,
And four grey Walers in his old black shandry-
dan.
Coonabarabran is always “home” to
the Castlereagh man, except when there
is a war on. There will be great doings
in the wide main street from the last day
in February till the third day in March.
The only pity is that the celebration
will not last three generations instead of
three days. Australia could do with a
thousand towns with the “Coona” spirit
and outlook, and six or seven times the
size; towns with industries sufficiently
varied to keep the young people of the
district on the spot making up the wool
which they produce and getting the
profits Of the manufacture of imported
raw materials, instead of sending their
cheques out of the district to fatten Syd-
ney and Melbourne suburbs and enable
city movie magnates to swank in Rolls-
Royces and floating palaces.
One day, some statesman will arise
who will realise that the real sturdiness
and security of Australia lie in such dis-
tricts. Then, perhaps, we shall have a
Back-to-Coonabarabran Era instead of a
Back-to-Coonabarabran Week.

The Juggernaut.
That overbearing monopoly the Post
Office, fresh from prohibiting the meter-
ing of telephones, has rolled over to
crush a little more life out of the coun-
try newspaper —usually a worthier ex-
emplar of sober and decent journalism
than some irresponsible city rags.
The expenses of country newspapers
are higher than those of city papers in
proportion to their circulations. Extra
freights, country telegram rates, passen-
ger fares and competition with metro-
politan journals which push into their
territories with aeroplanes and fast
motor-car deliveries weigh them down.
To cheapen their heavy telegraphic
costs many of them installed dictaphones,
which enabled rural editors to get their
telephoned city news more quickly and
cheaply and saved time in their offices.
In came the Scullin Government, and out
came a ukase that dictaphones must go.
The Scullin Government fell before
it could suppress the nefarious instru-
ment ; but the present Government has
proved nearly as unsympathetic. Its act-
ing P.M.G. points out that the use of
the dictaphone has “enabled the papers
to receive news for publication at rates
which represent a reduction of two-
thirds on the press tariff.” So, while
the gadgets are not to be outlawed, rates
on telephone business received by dicta-
phone are to go up 40 per cent. —which,
of course, progressive newspapers must
pay in addition to the price of the instru-
ment and of a private line which needs
to be installed to make it effective.
The Post Office is supposed to be a
public facility. It exists theoretically only
because it is a convenience to the pub-
lic. Actually, with its out-of-date atti-
tude towards the use of wireless and
modern telephone instruments, its inso-
lent and sometimes ultra-vires regula-
tions, its habit of squeezing every far-
thing it can out of its customers through
profiteering charges, it has become a vast
revenue-grabbing machine which doesn’t
give a twopenny dump for anything ex-
cept its own balance sheet; and that is
no credit to it. There are vast annual
losses on the telephone and telegraph
branches, due to reckless purchases, ex-
travagance in administration and ante-
diluvian business methods.
A progressive department would itself
put dictaphones into every office where
the bulk of business justified them.
«
Coppers’ Day.
February 1, 1934 —it is Coppers’ Day in
Sydney, and it says something for the
law-abiding spirit of the population that
it is not Burglars’ Day in the suburbs.
Every corner in the central street blocks
of the Great Metropolis is cordoned
with hefty men in blue, who look as if
they were just about to start playing
kiss-in-the-ring. Between the Town Hall
and The Bulletin office at 11 a.m.,
there were 38 of them in George-street
alone —which is equal to 100 to the mile.
At the “S. M. Herald” office are eight
specially lofty forms with set expressions
which make the passer-by look round
for bombs and barbed-wire and the rag-
ing hosts of Douglas.
Outside the entrance to Wynyard
station, nine under a sergeant guard the
entrance to the station which takes travel-
lers across Australia’s own ten-million-
pound bridge, while groups of flappers
gaze at them with earnest Zoo expres-
sions. Wherever there are coppers, there
are yellow lines drawn across the street
and guilty-looking pedestrians negotiat-
ing them with exactitude and determina-
tion, for all the world like hypnotised
hens and roosters. And in the crowds,
numerous plain-clothes men mingle, pre-
sumably to prevent the pockets of their
uniformed brethren from being picked.
Outside the guarded area, of course,
whole square miles of streets are a law-
breakers’ paradise. It is a goanna to a
gooseberry that in Mosman, for instance,
any citizen attacked by bandits could
holler through a megaphone for half an
hour without raising even one uniform.
But what’s a little quiet robbery, anyhow?
Three years ago a Borstal graduate
with 100 jobs in his record walked into
a Bulletin man’s house one afternoon,
packed £2OO worth of goods into suit-
cases, threw a couple of overcoats over
his arm for makeweight—the lot
weighed 701 b. or thereabouts —and caught
the tram in front of the police station.
Mr. Childs couldn’t spare an over-
worked detective sergeant to come and
talk about it till three days after-
wards. Although somebody recognised
the suitcases and telephoned the local
station when the villain of the piece had
only ten minutes’ start, all the Bulletin
man got back in the end was one empty
and battered bag delivered two months
afterwards.
The same could happen to-day. But let
anybody leave a car for ten minutes over
the allotted time in a side street or walk
crooked across the fairway and he is
pounced upon immediately by an athletic
constable and ordered to contribute to
consolidated revenue.

Democracy and Graft.
“D.”: It is odd that Sir John Sandeman
Allen should have claimed that graft is
only imaginable in the House of Com-
mons under a democratic regime. Of
course, as was pointed out (B. 31/1 /’34),
graft was rampant in England under
aristocratic regimes ; it ceased, for a time,
under Cromwell, reappeared with the
Restoration and persisted, with few pro-
tests, till 1833.
Democracy may be as moribund as
Mussolini says it is, but that is only be-
cause, like Christianity, it has never been
given a fair trial. Politicians disgusted
many British reformers with the Reform
Act before it had been in operation a
year, and their antics have been turning
people’s eyes in despair to all' kinds
of get-prosperity-quick nostrums —Soviet-
ism, Fascism, Douglas Creditism, Lang
Planism —ever since.
England has a good deal of graft still,
in spite of legislation against bribery
and strenuous efforts by private organisa-
tions. There seems to be less corruption
in the U.S.S.R. than in the capitalist
countries at the moment; but that is
only because Sovietism is still a perse-
cuted faith, so to speak. Graft will begin
in the great European republic as soon as
Russian statesmen return to top-hats and
trips to Paris. The Roman republic was
as sanctimoniously free from it as the
U.S.S.R. for generations ; by the time the
Christian era began Rome’s Senators,
Governors and generals were living on
graft.
With all its faults the democratic sys-
tem is the most effective prophylactic
against graft that has been devised.
The only reason intelligent people have
for believing in the virtual graft-free-
dom of Russia is the publication
from time to time of details of the
merciless punishments that have been in-
flicted on alleged grafters. This always
happens in tyrannies until the inevitable
day when the high officials begin grafting
themselves.
In England, Australia and other demo-
cratic countries the check relied on is not
a firing-squad, but “Hansard.” Grafters
are always liable to be exposed, in Parlia-
ment and the press; and once that has
been done the steam-roller of the law
starts on its way and can’t be stopped
or diverted. Witness the Kylsant case.
No doubt in democracies a good deal of
petty grafting goes on —in England the
activities of the anti-grafter are chiefly
aimed at preventing tips being given for
the purpose of getting business —but only
the desperadoes of finance tackle it on
a big scale.
All those who have studied history and
human nature, and (not being politicians)
are in a position to state the truth which
is in them, know that no form of gov-
ernment will entirely stop graft. But
elected Parliaments functioning under
the supervision of a free press can do a
lot. Put it to the credit of the democratic
system that it has got in the way of thou-
sands of ramps which would have been
liable to go through under almost any
other system.

America for the Americans.
A perusal of U.S.A. shipping journals
and of the evidence before the Senatorial
Committee which has been probing the
matter of subsidies shows where we stand
with the lines which are doing their best
to capture the whole of the Pacific trade.
The Dollar Line has contracted Federal
debts totalling 27,000,600 dollars. Gov-
ernment has fed it and its subsidiaries
to such an extent that it has received
from the public purse of Washington
4,300,000 dollars more than the original
cost of its vessels, in addition to loans
for new construction and reconditionings.
In the ten years during which it has been
subsidised by the Shipping Board, its
profits have been 22,188,000 dollars, in-
cluding a write-up of assets of about
7,000,000 dollars. R. Stanley Dollar
admitted before the committee that he
was handed an amount of 635,000 dollars
by the Shipping Board as commission
on the sale of vessels which his own co.
bought.
But as if this were not enough, the
shipping press is advocating measures
which amount to an attempt to drive
all non-U.S.A. shipping out of U.S.A.
ports. The influential “Marine News’
of N.Y., for instance, writes:
So long as. any individual, firm or organ-
isation receives compensation from the Gov-
ernment under the provisions of a Merchant
Marine Act of 1928 contract, they should be
estopped from acting as agent or agents for
foreign flag ships, and their mail pay compen-
sation should cease with the entry of their first
foreign consigned ship in an American port.
... .Chartered tonnage must be on the Ameri-
can registry.... If no suitable American ship
is available, it will always be possible to build
a new one with the aid of the Shipping Board.
They must be American-manned to the
extent of two-thirds of the crew.
The spirit is excellent —from a U.S.A.
viewpoint. We might well emulate the
American measures.
There has been altogether too much
shilly-shally about the business in Can-
berra.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Bundalinga”: One objection to
“party” telephone lines is the stickybeak
subscriber. On our line two men were
discussing a business deal when one re-
marked that he thought someone was
listening-in. “That’s right,” the other re-
plied ; “I can smell her. She’s been eat-
ing onions.” “I haven’t, you brute!”
broke in a very angry female voice.
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: Whenever a warrant is
issued for the apprehension of an offender
the constable in charge of the case has
to fill in a questionnaire about it. Re-
cently a Sydney suburban constable
pondered long and earnestly over the
question “Habits and antecedents.”
Finally, with the air of one who has
“I may be old-fashioned, but I do think a backless frock shouldn’t show more
than four joints of the tail.”
solved an intricate puzzle, he wrote
“Likes beer.”
* * *
“Styx”: Close on 50 persons have
already propelled themselves over the
.Sydney Harbor Bridge, which is now
undergoing a belated attempt to render
it suicide-proof. A certain grim humor
differentiated one recent case from all
the rest. Before taking the leap the self-
doomed man was seen to spin a coin
ahead of him —presumably his last shil-
ling, which would be of no further use
to him, or it is just possible he may
have been thinking of the ferry fare for
Charon. And on the pavement of the
bridge, just by his jumping-off place,
there was found a State lottery ticket,
which wouldn’t have been any use to
him, either, even had he lived, for it
drew a blank. The writing on it showed
that it had been taken for the “Over the
Bridge” syndicate. One wonders if the
young woman who collected his five and
threepence and inscribed the ticket for
him gave the customer’s choice of
nomenclature a second thought.
* * * *
“D.E.”: I read that the late Home
from Home Hotel, on which the fury of
the Kalgoorlie mob was first concentrated
last week, was kept by “R. Gianatti.”
When I knew it 34 years ago the pro-
prietor was a little Welshman named
Jonathan Morris. I thought Jonathan fat
and scant of breath when I called at his
joint to spend my first night in the gold-
fields metropolis—“meals,” he wheezed,
were “a shillin’, and beds eighteenpence” ;
but no one has since pursued me for a
bob with greater celerity than Jonathan
showed when, having partaken of a vile
dinner, I absent-mindedly retired without
paying to the dingy room one fourth
part of which I had hired for one and
six. Nearly opposite the Home from
Home was the All Nations, run by one
Armanasco and then (as I was soon to
discover) familiarly known as “The
Bloodhouse” ; it went up in smoke with
the Home from Home. In later years
Morris had his galvanised-iron caravan-
serai pulled down and rebuilt in brick.
He also put up a hall in which he showed
moving-pictures on Sunday nights ; “ad-
mission, silver coin.” In the hope of
circumventing his frugal-minded patrons,
90 per cent, of whom weighed in with
the smallest bit of silver coined, he tried
to effect a corner in threepences. It was
a scheme worthy of Jimmy Tyson : but
it failed.

“Bangemall”: Among the characters
introduced in a serial now running in
the “S. M. Herald,” the scene
of which is laid in a gold-
fields settlement north of
Kalgoorlie, is “a Chinese boy
who got an occasional job on
the mine” —where the hero
and his mates are engaged.
The search for a Chinaman
on the Westralian goldfields
would have been a hopeless
job at any time during the
last 40 years, and the idea of
one being employed (if he
were discoverable) on a mine
is too preposterous for words.
Westralian law forbids the
issue of miners’ rights to
Asiatics.
“F.S.”: That the Stavisky scandals
should have caused the downfall of the
French Government is not surprising.
A Melbourne artist once caught a carp
on a bent pin in the Luxembourg Gar-
dens. He hurried home in triumph with
his prize and gave it to his landlady to
cook. When the cook learnt where the
dish had come from she was horrified. It
appeared that these carp were as sacred
in Paris as the tomb of Napoleon ; they
were centuries old and had been fed from
the fair hands of kings’ mistresses. The
landlady shrieked and sobbed and threat-
ened to go into hysterics ; then she put
on her hat with the intention of laying
an information. Her husband, who had
some job under the Government, then
came into the picture. He implored his
spouse not to say anything about it.
“If this became known,” he said, “the
Government would not live a moment.”
"All my life I've been saving my kisses for a man like you.”
"Prepare to lose the savings of a lifetime.”
He was quite serious about it, and
his lady was equally impressed, so,
after they had both castigated the con-
trite offender, they all sat down and pol-
ished off the fish, and the artist shouted
a bottle of wine, by way of penance.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: A man’s kind heart has
got him into trouble in S.A. X hammered
his own mother. Y saw it all and told
the police so ; but then Mrs. X begged
him not to send her son to gaol, and so
at the trial he denied it, on oath. The
main result was that he went up for six
months himself, for perjury.
* * * *
“Selma”: A suburban musical society
which owes much of its prosperity to the
support of a wealthy local enthusiast
submitted its latest programme for the
patron’s approval. The local soprano was
billed to warble “Lo! Here the Gentle
Lark,” but the chief subscriber declined
to pass the item. “Take this back to the
printer and tell him not to be so careless,”
he said. “When you to anything
you spell that word h-e-a-r”!
* * * *
“Audit”: There is plenty of evidence
that bottled beer gains more in flavor
and potency with age than most wines
and spirits do (B. 31/1 / ’34). When Sir
John Franklin set out on his search for
the North-West P-assage in 1845, he took
with him a quantity of bottled stout of
special strength. Fifteen years later
some of this was discovered, with other
relics of the expedition, and brought
back to England. The stuff had matured
into a brew so potent that the hardiest of
topers could hardly negotiate a single
bottle.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: The latest spot to be
smitten with the indecency complex is
Seremban, British Malaya, where a rick-
shaw coolie was fined for doffing his
upper garment. He must have been a
bewildered Celestial, for the habit of bar-
ing their usually ample stomachs is de
rigueur even amongst Chinese plutocrats,
and the rickshaw coolie in my day seldom
bothered about more than the briefest
pair of knickers. But Mother Grundy is
as active in Asia as on the Melbourne
beaches. Until recently, Balinese women
in the Dutch East Indies strode along the
roads swinging their magnificent bosoms
and looking like Greek goddesses. Then
a new controleur arrived with a wife
afflicted by a Freudian complex. She
told her husband that the sight shocked
her ; and now the women of Bali tuck a
cloth into the baskets they carry on their
heads. When they see a white resident
approaching they ring down the curtain,
so to speak, throwing it back as soon
as they have passed him.
*i* H*
“Binduli”: Kalgoorlie has seen a few
riots and disturbances in the course of
its close on 40 years of existence, but
nothing previously on the scale of the
recent one. Yet the 1898 row, which.
was mild in comparison, got far more
publicity. That was the occasion when
Bigjohn Forrest, who had refused to
address the alluvial diggers, was hustled
on his way to the railway station and
poked in the ribs with an umbrella (some
said accidentally by his own secretary).
A bard of the period summed up the
devastation in this wise:
There’s a whole yard of glass come to grief
in the shops;
There’s twelve buttons the less among seventeen
cops;
There’s a lame dog that’s suffered a happy
rglease;
There’s a bellman in quod for a breach of the
peace.
And Sir John? Oh, his hat and one cuff of
his shirt
Got crushed in the riot where no one was hurt.
And the “Riot Where No One Was Hurt”
it remained, though the victim of the out-
rage received scores or hundreds of sym-
pathetic telegrams, including the famous
“My God! I am proud of you” effusion.

“The Dip”: Gangs of youthful crooks
have been largely responsible for Bris-
bane’s recent epidemic of suburban bur-
glaries. Some of the juveniles didn’t stop
at burglary, either. The loot from one sub-
urban raid included a pair of expensive
field glasses, which one of the lads
offered to a second-hand dealer. The
latter told the boy that he would have
to bring a note from one of his parents
before any business could be done;
the lad returned next morning with a
note asking the dealer to pay, as mother
was ill and there was no money in the
house. The dealer bought the glasses, but
when the members of this particular
gang were arrested it transpired that the
letter was a forgery.
* * * *
“Friar Tuck”: “Kutchee Wallah” is
himself in error when he seeks to cor-
rect “Wing Commander” about those
“screw guns” (B. 24/1 / ’34). The Indian
native army has always followed the
Imperial army in its equipment, the
discarded arms being passed over to the
native troops. The R.G.A. mountain
batteries were long equipped with„ the
ten-pounder B.L. (the “screw gun ot
Kipling’s poem); when the R.G.A. was
rearmed with the Q.F., the screw guns
were handed over to the native bat-
teries. It was these guns that the Indian
mountain batteries had at Anzac, and
they were subsequently used in the Sinai
Peninsula.
THE DIRGE OF THE JAY-WALKER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The police campaign against jay-walking was
begun in Sydney last week.”
She walked in beauty—nice and neat
From kerb to kerb her way she bore.
’Twas fine to see her fairy feet
Go tripping through the traffic’s roar.
But it’s decreed she cross the street
In that insouciant way no more.
From point to point, at fancy’s whim,
She used to flit with swift resource,
Ignoring imprecations grim,
Oblivious of warnings hoarse,
Serenely risking life and limb
To cut a corner off her course.
And truth to tell and sooth to speak
It’s little guidance that she’s had.
The stronger sex should coach the weak
In Safety First, but lass and lad
In preference for paths oblique
Seem just as uniformly bad.
Flo! scurrying Sis and brother mine,
Flo! billowy dame and portly knight,
Take this for token and for sign:
You’ll quickly come to rue your plight
If you neglect the dotted line
Or deviate from angles right.
Forget the idle, careless past,
The walking-as-you-please-to days.
The bolt has fall’n; the die is cast;
The ban descends on slanting ways.
The cops are on the job at last;
The Johns are out to jolt the Jays !

T. THE R.


“Gentle Joe”: A photograph published
in Sydney “Sun” depicts the apart-
ment in Government House in which
Prince George will take his dose of
shut-eye when he visits Sydney. The
apartment isn’t very large, but into it
there have been crammed (a) one ancient
brass double bedstead, with canopy ; ( b )
one wooden three-quarter bedstead (of
the pattern marked 375. 6d. in the cata-
logues of furnishers for the frugal); (c)
one old-fashioned sofa, with loose-cover ;
(d) one old-fashioned washstand, with
mirror, ewer and basin; (e) one chair,
with a loose cover over the seat; (/) one
very massive round table loaded with
photographs. There is a bathroom ad-
joining (so small that the tub appears to
be poking through the door), and the
legend says that the sun comes peeping
in at morn through the one narrow win-
dow disclosed ; but it’s an awful room —
insanitary, inartistic and reminiscent of
what the village pub bridal chamber looks
like during race-week. If Prince George
is permitted to set foot in it he’ll come
"This reference from your last employer is very badly written —almost illegible,
in fact.”
"Oh, but you see when he wrote it I was sitting on his lap”
to the conclusion that N. S. Wales
stopped paying salaries to its Governors
in 1860 and that they have since been
taking in boarders.
* * * *
“H. 8.”: While a Queensland medico
was on the links a sudden rise in
temperature in the neighborhood of
his hip pocket, accompanied by a strong
smell of burning cloth, testified to the
dangerous repository he had found for
a lighted pipe. Fellow-golfers decor-
ously ringed him round while he removed
the smouldering garment, one of them
remarking, “By Jove, Doc., how would
you have managed if it had been a
mixed foursome?” “Well,” drawled the
victim of his own carelessness, “I can
assure you I wouldn’t have burnt to
death! ”
* * * *
“Pat Bushie”: N.S.W. Liquor Act does
not debar a publican from having music
on his licensed premises (B. 24/1/’34);
the prohibition only applies to the public
portion of the establishment. The Act
also provides for the granting by the
Licensing Court of permits entitling
Bung to include music in the day’s pro-
gramme ; these were frequently sought
in the days of 11 p.m. closing, but there is
no demand for them now. In any case
every publican, city and country, gets
music on his premises through the wire-
less. He is entitled to broadcast news,
and this is frequently interspersed with
musical items. Should the licensing in-
spector happen along the excuse is “I
did not have time to switch off when the
music came on” ; and it ends at that.
* * *
“Nakh”: Touching the Vic. education
authorities’ plan to bring in the Dalton
system (B. 31/1/’34), two of my children
had a year in a Daltonised private school.
One complained to a teacher that another
girl had hit her. Teacher kissed the
aggressor and said, “Oh, darling, don’t
do that—it’s so anti-social! ”
“Masrab”: The acquisition by the
British Museum of the ancient Bible
manuscript which was once the property
of the Mt. Sinai monastery recalls that
in Egypt and parts adjacent there are
other isolated communities likely to be
possessed of manuscripts of incalculable
value. This is particularly the case with
the many Coptic monasteries of the West-
ern Egyptian desert, known as Deirs and
enclosed within high and unscalable
walls to ensure safety against the
Bedouin. Those who served with the
mounted troops in the campaign against
the Senussi in 1915 will recall Deir Abu
Makar at Wadi Natrun. The few who
visited this walled community stepped
back into the Middle Ages. One heavily
plated door at ground level was rarely
opened. Supplies and casual visitors were
hoisted in baskets up the 30ft. wall. The
pride of this Deir is the wonderful col-
lection of ancient Biblical and other re-
ligious manuscripts in Syriac and uncial
Greek. In pre-war days collectors from
all over the world tried for these, but
rarely clinched a bargain. The monks
valued them as beyond money, which
explains why the monastery of Sinai is
now demanding the return of a treasure
which, it is asserted, the Soviet never had
a right to sell.
* * * *
“Runa”: Residents of the volcanic
areas round Auckland (M.L.) have their
troubles about lawn-making, too (B.
31/1 / ’34). In the loose red soil there are
hundreds of volcanic rocks, all shapes
and sizes, and these have to be removed
before a reliable surface can be expected.
We had just induced a croquet court to
lie flat and green when it was observed
that just about the middle a patch of
dying grass had appeared. The patch in-
creased in size and deadness, and what
had been a level green developed a slight
hump under the faded grass. We diag-
nosed the trouble as a rock working up-
wards in the usual manner of these stones,
and an effort was made to assist the
basalt to emerge. All encouragement
was unavailing ; the intruder proved to
be a huge boulder which would take
possibly years to wholly appear. When
we left the place the lawn was a thin
fringe of grass surrounding a 40-ton rock.
* * * *
“H.R.P.”: The purchase and consign-
ment to Melbourne of Captain Cook’s
dad’s cottage has not gone unnoticed
among English land-agents. Witness this
advt.:
Adam Lindsay Gordon’s Boyhood Home for
sale; £lOOO. Apply Spier, Priory st., Chelten-
ham, England.
“I like this one, but I don’t think it would go with hair my color”
“Ah, but madame knows how easy it is to change the color of one’s hair.”
“Idle Imp”: Truth will out! Trans-
ferred recently to another State, I left
instructions with a firm of Sydney car-
riers to ship the whole of my goods after
me. When they arrived I found that for
packing hundreds of “Daily Telegraphs”
had been used. Every one bore the same
date in August last, and each was
stamped “Free copy delivered by your
milkman.”
* * * *
“Jerry”: Is this an old trick? Was
having a drink in a Brisbane pub when
a well-dressed fellow blew in, and, after
doing the same, bought a bottle of
whisky. Stowing it away, still wrapped, in
his open office bag, he
began to talk horse to the
barman. Entered another
man, evidently a friend,
and the first chap re-
marked to him, “I’ve
got the whisky, a bottle
of Black Horse.” “Pity
you didn’t get King
Edward,” grumbled the
other. “Oh, well,” said
No. 1, “we can easily
mend that,” and, handing
over the wrapped bottle,
he asked the barman to
change it for the brand his
mate preferred. The pair
drifted out, and, a cus-
tomer entering with a re-
quest for Black Horse, the
barman opened the bottle
still standing on the coun-
ter and passed it over. A moment later
the purchaser was profanely spitting out
what proved to be cold tea. “And I’ve
known those two cows for over a month,”
said the barman disgustedly.
* * * *
“McTrotsky”: Touching kilts, I have
just received from my Moscow corres-
pondent photographs of the reception of
the new American Ambassador to the
U.S.S.R. and his daughter. The young
woman is shown garbed in a kilt
of what appears to be the Royal Stewart
tartan. What company good Queen Vic-
toria’s invention gets into sometimes!
* * * *
“Harmon Hies”: Melba once took a
house at Rose Bay (Sydney), and a city
firm was instructed to send out two
pianos. The grands were set up in sepa-
rate rooms, and the tuner who attended
was informed that they must be in abso-
lute unison. The Dame entered as he
was preparing to deal with the first in-
strument. She said, “Never mind that
tuning-fork. Listen —Ah-h. That’s ‘A.’
Do you want it again?” She waited till
that string was tuned and then asked
how it was proposed to ensure the same
tone in the second piano. When a pitch-
pipe was produced, she remarked “I have
no faith in them. When you are finished
in this room, let me know.” In due
course, she put in an appearance in the
other room, and the second piano was
also tuned to Melba’s “A.” Those instru-
ments were in unison all right. I know,
because the tuner told me, with a twinkle,
that he tried ’em privately with his pitch-
pipe whilst the diva was out.
* * * *
“Lao-dah”: It is a significant commen-
tary on health weeks and similar activi-
ties at which the dietitians thunder warn-
ings that a woman became seriously ill
and two people died the other day as a
result of eating roast pork in Melbourne.
One of the deceased was a 33-year-old
father, the other was a 2i-year-old baby.
The mother of the family, who was also
the cook, recovered.
* * * *
“Wen”: It had to come. Couples in
search of novelty have been married in
aeroplanes, in yachts, by wireless and
telephone, in lions’ cages, on tops of
mountains and in submarines. Now a
couple have been wed in the nudist
colony at Elsinore, California. ’Groom,
preacher, best man and bridesmaid were
all clothesless, and the bride had nothing
more than a bouquet for her wedding-
dress. The spectators, however, included
one man wearing a beard and several
women wearing slippers. A camera faith-
fully recorded the ceremony.
* * * *
“S.W.K.”: According to Dr. Freeth, of
Imperial Chemical Industries, the lethal
qualities of some of the gases employable
for military purposes have been greatly
exaggerated. Mustard gas is still the
most to be feared ; although it travels
slowly and but a short distance, it
clings to the ground, as Diggers who in-
judiciously hopped into shell-holes for
cover for a day or so after a bombard-
ment found to their cost. Carbon
monoxide, though a more subtle killer,
is useless owing to its easy neutralisation
by atmospheric ventilation; chlorine
must have conditions for its release which
are rarely to be found. The deadliest of
all, hydrocyanic acid, a frightful killer at
close quarters, is impracticable for mili-
tary use. Another reassuring statement
by the same authority is that the latest
gas masks are proof against all gases
likely to be used in future wars, despite
wild tales of vapors that will eat through
rubber and leather.
A HANDSOME OFFER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Speaking at Sydney Mr. Lyons suggested that Mr.
Lang would be better in Federal politics. lie
would then do no more mischief in N. S. Wales, and
the Federal Parliament would see that he did no
mischief there.”
Send him up here if ’fis his wish. Translate
him,
Like boisterous Nick Bottom, for a space.
Take it from me we’ll mighty soon deflate him
And relegate him to his proper place.
At Sydney he’s a terror evidently,
A snorting, bellowing bull; but up above
We’ll discipline him till he roars as gently
As any sucking dove.
Send him up here. Convert your bogey horrid
Into a puppet, impotent and droll.
We’ll strip the brass, believe me, from his fore-
head
And gouge the iron, if any, from his soul.
We’ll take his measure and, when that’s
adjusted,
With ridicule we’ll rout his rave and ramp,
And leave your bugbear like a drum that’s
busted,
Aye, like a ribless gamp.
Send him up here. He’ll find his wild and
woolly
Notions at Canberra a flop complete ;
Scant chance he’ll get to blare and bounce and
bully
After his fashion in Macquarie-street.
He’ll have no pack of sycophants behind him
To hail with wild applause his emptiest yap;
And even in our midst we shall not mind him
A microscopic scrap.
Send him up here. He’s surely played the devil
Sufficiently in an inferior sphere.
He’ll quickly find his legislative level
Among Australia’s elect—up here.
We’ll take him off you, there you have it
clearly,
And put him, for your good, upon the shelf.
I cannot vouch for Scullin, though—l’m merely
Announcing for myself.

POLITICAL POINTS
In sincere flattery of the late President
Wilson, Attorney-General Latham, who
does all his Government’s thinking for
it, has prepared 14 points for discussion
by the Premiers, who are to meet in Mel-
bourne this month. It recalls one of
Clemenceau’s quips. “Fourteen points! ”
said the mordant old man. “Ten were
enough for le bon Dieu.”
Lyons is already electioneering against
the Country party. In Sydney last week
he said its bulletins were “becoming
notorious” (the latest is devoted to an
approval of Government measures), and
asked whether it claimed to have reduced
taxation by £10,000,000. Actually Earle
Page wanted a reduction of £20,000,000,
and Parkhill sneered at him on that
score. Lyons should be trying to heal
the breach between the parties, instead of
widening it. Australia is hungry for
leadership, and N. S. Wales is witnessing
a brisk revival of the demand for Bruce.
Lang suffered two nasty shocks last
week. In Melbourne his agent, Crofts,
was beaten in the Vic. A.L.P. ballot to
elect delegates to the usual quarterly
“unity” conference. In Sydney Willis was
admitted to the Fed. Labor group, and so
was C. A. Morgan, who would be
M.H.R. for Reid if he had not been
deposed from first place in the ballot in
the interest of Lang’s seat-warmer
Gander. By way of avenging himself on
Gander, who guyed him last session, and,
girding at Gander’s boss, Makin, M.H.R.
for Hindmarsh, has suggested Beasley
as a Federal leader who might suit both
factions. This also is a facer for Lang,
who brooks no rivals near the throne.
Forgan Smith’s name is being can-
vassed as a possible captain of Federal
Labor. Brisbane papers say that if an
invitation were forthcoming he would
“seriously consider it” and that his col-
leagues would release him from their
mutual pledge to face the electors as
one entity. Forgan’s entry into Com-
monwealth politics would be a good
thing. His record as State Premier shows
that he has what Fisher had and what
Labor most needs—honesty of purpose
and sanity. Lang will never lead Federal
Labor to victory. Neither will Scullin
any more. The man from Pairthshire
might.
A standing committee of the Reps, is
to consider a recommendation that hence-
forward miscreants who commit breaches
of privilege, such as making rude remarks
about salary grabs, may be hauled before
a High Court Judge and fined £5OO or
stuck in a Federal dungeon for a year.
It is not proposed to give private citizens
any protection against political ruffians
who make slanderous attacks on them
under cover of privilege.
Three main tenders have been received
by the Commonwealth for the Australia-
Singapore air service—from Imperial Air-
ways-Qantas, New England Airways, and
Larkins in association with Westralian
Airways and C. T. P. Ulm. Results will
be known next month, and before the
year is out people will be sticking eighteen-
penny stamps on letters which, under the
breathless schedule approved by Pearce,
will beat the present land-water-air mail
to England by fully four days.
“Compulsory training for the Defence
Force is to be resumed immediately”—
but in South Africa, not in Australia.
A Labor Government suspended our sys-
tem as soon as it arrived in office in
1929, and the U.A.P. Government, which
is headed by a gentleman who was a
member of the' Labor Government, has
not had the courage to restore it. Some
of the beneficiaries were conspicuous in
the mob that ran riot in Kalgoorlie last
week. It was possibly their way of
demonstrating devotion to the great
Labor principles of pacifism and inter-
nationalism ; but had they been sub-
jected to the restraints of military train-
ing they might not have been there.
During the week in which the Midland
Railway Co. announced that it had paid
all its 1933 interest and taxes, transferred
£37,000 to reserve funds and carried for-
ward £16,357, the W.A.G.R., which
doesn’t have to pay taxes, reported
its loss for the half-year—£2o2,loo. It
recently acquired another commissioner.
He is a good man by all accounts, but it
might be better to borrow the manager
of the co. for a twelvemonth and see
what he can do with the Government
system.
The Stevens Government is intrigued at
the news that the people of Wellington
(M.L.) are getting bottled milk from their

is to find out at first-hand how it is done,
He will discover, for one thing, that Wei-
lington has no Milk Board which fixes
boom-time prices for all concerned, and
that overlapping in distribution has been
reduced to a minimum. It rages un-
checked in all our capital cities ; it is
,f rh . a P s « ors *
in Perth. There it has been found that
in one small street 23 vendors served 55
customers with a total of 111 pints.
Tasmania during the last two recorded
year has spent only 3s. a head of loan
money, while Westralia has spent £4
2s. 6d. a head. These figures were quoted
by .Chief Secretary James to the States
Grants Commission in support of the
Speck’s claim for a higher Common-
wealth subvention. It is asking for
£1,099,500 per year instead of the
£380,000 voted this year. Westralia is de-
manding a rise of £900,000 to £1,500,000 ;
South Aus. one of £850,000 to £2,000,000.
Except, perhaps, in the cities, all the
States are under-policed. Westralia,
as might be expected from the Kal-
goorlie riots, is the worst example. Its
force has the greatest area in the
Commonwealth to look after, and the
average W.A. peeler has about 80 more
people to protect than the N.S.W. cop.
Total strength of the constabulary in the
last five years for which the Common-
wealth Statistician gives comparative
figures was 537, 541, 549, 581 and 562-
five women police are included. This form
of ‘'economy” comes natural to Govern-
ments which are,grossly extravagant in
other directions, especially as the police
vote is too scattered to matter.
Daladier is back as Prime Minister of
France, the Chautemps Ministry having
collapsed. The French sadly miss Poin-
care. Lacking his strong hand at the
helm, their country has drifted into a
quarrel with U.S.A. over debts, a trade
dispute with Britain and the Stavisky
scandal, one result of which has been
a run on savings banks And French in-
Auenee in foreign affairs has declined so
seriously that even Poland, its special
creation, has signed a non-aggression pact
with Germany.
Nearly all the ratepayers of Sydney
are with Spooner in his campaign against
the lodger franchise ; but U.A.P. vote-
catchers are objecting, and they may be
too many for him. Some very poor
specimens of politicians got in on the
U.A.P. ticket at the- State election, and
at the Commonwealth election, too. One
of the things Sydney may expect if the
lodger vote is retained was indicated
when Garden, who is an alderman,
moved that the council should pay its
swarming employees 15 per cent, more
than the pay fixed by Judge Cantor after
a long inquiry. The Lud Mayor voted
against this cool proposal, but also voted
against the council being represented on
an appeal against the Cantor award. He
owes his election to Garden.
Farmers who expected prompt pay-
ment of the Commonwealth wheat
bounty will be lucky if they get it before
Easter. In the shiftless Canberra fashion
the money is to be handed over to the
State Governments, and all they have so
far received are copies of the Wheat-
growers’ Relief Act. They, for their part,
will have to set up authorities to receive
applications and distribute cheques ; and
farmers will be obliged to make statutory
declarations as to acreage, produce
income-tax clearances, and what not. No
person is eligible for the bounty who
paid tax for the year to June 30, 1933,
unless he applies as a pauper. Thousands
of farmers who had no taxable income
last year did not send in returns. How
they will get on without the stipulated
certificate from some Deputy Commis-
sioner of Taxation has not been ex-
plained.
The law against usury has cut Queens-
land moneylenders to the heart. In
voices broken with sobs a deputation
protested that a maximum of 20 per shent
per annum was too small a pound of
flesh and that lenders should be allowed
besides raising the rate, to charge on a
flat overall basis instead of on unpaid
balances only. The Attorney-General’s
refusal was polite—far politer probably
than his thoughts.
In terms reminiscent of the manifesto
of the Tooley-street tailors, a set of
Labor delegates in Melbourne has de-
fined its attitude to war, other than what
one Considine called “the working-class
war.” It “forbids any Australian Gov-
ernment to participate in any war” against
the Soviet Union (first on the list, of
course!), the independence of India, Ire-
land or South Africa, and the emanci-
pation of China; and in any war
arising out of any union of Ger-
many and Austria, any challenge
to the French possession of Alsace-Lor-
raine, and any violation of the neutrality
of Denmark or Belgium. Apparently
as an afterthought, the U.S.A. was added
to the list of countries which Australian
Governments are forbidden to fight, but
Japan was not. Australian Governments
are even forbidden to fight for the main-
tenance of British control of the Suez
Canal, though if control of the Suez Canal
passed to an enemy—possibly the loved
U.S.S.R., which has done its damned-
est to stir up civil war in this country —
it might mean the finish of Australia.
A pilgrimage and the sequel:
Girard, the Sydney tram-driver who went to
Moscow and found wretchedly paid women
doing the sort of work for which he and his
mates get union wages, returned to find his job
gone. It seems that he “notified the depart-
ment that he required leave” (the words are
those of “the Girard Reinstatement Com-
mittee”), and took it when it was refused, being
of opinion that “his first duty was,” not to the
Government which paid his wages (partly out
of the taxes), gave him the 44-hour week and
kept an insolvent superannuation fund going
(wholly out of the taxes) for the employees,
but “to the men who had elected him to go
to Moscow and provided the necessary finance.”
It is a startling example of the job-control
spirit. Still, Girard was doubtless advised, if
not ordered, to do what he did, and Bolshies
who infest the service could be better spared.
It should be remembered in his favor that his
report is a smack in the eye for that mob.

Justice Ferguson writes:

Few men experience more difficulty in
writing home than does E. J. Lewis, the
A.B.C.’s new Brisbane manager; the
reason for this is that he was born in
a Welsh town with a name which spells
like a Chinese code word —Yftradygynlais.
E. J. LEWIS, new manager of 4QG,
Brisbane.
His small stature and soft Welsh
voice notwithstanding, Lewis left Aus-
tralia as a sergeant with the First Division
in 1914. He saw service on Gallipoli and
was invalided back to this country, where
he served for a time in the militia and
later in the Victorian public service. In
1925 he turned to broadcasting, which
has occupied him ever since as account-
ant, programme-director and station
manager. The last few years have been
spent in control of station 7ZL, Hobart.
During the time he was programme-
director and manager of 3LO, Melbourne,
licenses showed a greater increase than
has ever been recorded in the Common-
wealth over a similar period.
To Hughie Connell, M.L.A. for Hamil-
ton (N.S.W.), as to so many more of the
Men Who Came Back, length of days has
been denied. Hughie was a sensitive, good-
looking chap who gave the impression of
always being in pain. Everybody re-
spected him, and even in tense moments
there was a sure smile waiting for
Hughie Connell even when he was
in the thick of a row and sometimes,
as Chairman of Committees, had to
quiet the tempest of abuse. Before 1915,
he was a schoolmaster, and his war record
of four years was a splendid one. He was
in the worst of the fighting in 1917-18, won
a D.S.O. and M.C. and Bar, was men-
tioned three times in dispatches and came
back a major. He won the old Kahibah
State seat at the first post-war election,
and was a staunch Labor supporter
throughout his political career.

of Sin, Sweat and Sorrow” the other day.
He founded his business, which now em-
ploys hundreds of men, in a tiny shop 59
years ago ; since then he has built the
plant for whole sugar mills, founded the
outfit of the Alligator Creek meatworks
and forged the metal for the Fitzroy
Bridge. The first flat-head battery on
Charters Towers came from his foundry,
and he once made a plant which bored
an artesian well a mile and a quarter
deep. When he was 90, Burns took
his first aeroplane trip—to Cracow. He
proposes “to live to 130,” and his only
fads are chillies, of which he eats one
every day, and cheese. He is famous, too,
in the Central District, where drinks are
drinks, for his rum toddy, which is
flavored with chillies, honey and fruit
juice and is guaranteed to make even an
auditor rejoice.
Edward Lloyd Jones, who died during
the week, had been chairman of the cen-
tury-old Sydney firm of David Jones, but
his tastes ran to the land, and so soon as
his opportunity came he took to station
life, first on the southern edge of the New
England and then at Tarcutta. His pas-
sion was for Shorthorns, and he imported
some of the best sires of recent years and
bred them very successfully on Hordern
and old-time Bates strains. He was a
gentle person, but dowered with all a
Welshman’s enthusiasm, and he was a
familiar figure at Royal Show ringsides,
leaning tensely forward, his hands clasped
on the knob of his stick, not missing a
point in the judging drama of a sunny
Shorthorn morning. For a time he was
president of the N.S.W. branch of the
Beef Shorthorn Society, but his health
was not strong enough to carry his enthu-
siasm. Most Shorthorn breeders in N. S.
Wales owe something to his kindness.
From an old friend:
Archibald Watson’s “mannerisms” (B.
24/1/’34), so well known to students at Adel-
aide Uni. up to a few years ago, were largely
the outcome of a hectic voyage in the South
Pacific, in sail, round about 1870-1871.
Finding the paternal station home some-
what tiresome, he went to sea, but un-
luckily selected the brig Carl as the vessel
of his fortunes. Quitting the ill-omened
craft just before she was grabbed by
H.M.S. Cossack, young Watson was about to
be put under Consular arrest in Fiji when,
with the help of an emissary sent by his father
from Australia, he got away on a Yankee
whaler. Eventually he reached Paris and
studied medicine, graduating later in a German
university, and yet later acting as demonstrator
in anatomy at Cook’s School in London,
whence he was appointed as prof, at Adel-

Adelaide.
aide. Watson was for years recognised as the
ablest anatomist in Australia, and amongst the
best of the consulting surgeons, although he
never operated. Under a shell of gruffness and
cynicism he hides a heart of gold.
J. D. Ross, appointed Royal Commis-
sioner to inquire into the Queensland
wheat and flour industries, is an official
of the State Audit Department who acted
as secretary of the commission that re-
ported on secret commissions in the
dairying industry. He was on the special
committee which examined the Mackay
Harbor scheme. Forgan Smith keeps him
busy: he is a member of the Queensland
Meat Industry Board, of the Agricultural
Bank Loan Board, and of the Rural
Assistance ditto, and knows his way
about in most financial mazes.
Scorfield’s sketch of Arnold Brown is
lifelike in its dash and debonairness.
Brown is a long Australian who looks as
if he had been born under a saltbush, and

A.I.F .) goes back to Coonabarabran.
he has energy which even the Prussians
failed to damp with enough wounds to
keep the average man in Randwick Hospi-
tal for life. In the words of the Official
History, “Brown was no backline war-
rior. He held the windmill crest at
Pozieres, and rallied the troops at Flers
and had been wounded when personally
leading an audacious attempt to retrieve
a desperate situation.” His part in the
first battle of Bullecourt was notable, but
his share in the second, in which he led
detachments of the 28th and a reinforce-
ment from the sth Brigade which volun-
teered “ready to do anything” in a hope-
less situation, was one of the epics of the
war. A bombing aeroplane knocked a
few chips off him later at Reninghelst,
but he lived to raise sheep on the Castle-
reagh and to conduct the affairs of the
Coonabarabran Show Society, of which
he is the president, with all the vigor
of his war days. And if anybody suggests
that he wouldn’t ride a buckjumping
bull —well, bring out your bull!
Ernest Heitmann, who died at Bendigo
last week, had sat in the Westralian
Assembly and the House of Reps.
He was an engine-driver on the Fingal
mine when he got the Labor nomina-
tion for Cue in 1904. He held
what had become a safe Labor seat until
it seemed in danger of being abol-
ished for lack of voters, and then moved
on to Geraldton. A wild and whirling
Laborite at the outset he parted company
with his old comrades over the conscrip-
tion business, and was selected to give
Hugh Mahon a run for Kalgoorlie. Heit-
mann succeeded in dispossessing Mahon
after a particularly bitter contest, but the
ex-Federal Minister turned the tables on
his vanquisher at the next election. After
that politics knew Heitmann no more.
Just deceased Harry Courtney Luck
had been secretary of the Queensland
Commercial Travellers’ Association since
1887 and had been in the Northern
State just over 50 years. He made the
C. T. Club in Brisbane one of the best of
its kind in the Empire and he was a per-
sistent advertiser of Queensland resources.
He represented the State at the Mel-
bourne Exhibition of 1888, when Aus-
tralia’s centenary was celebrated, and at
the Greater Britain Exhibition in London
in 1899. Just after the war he again
visited England as Queensland Grand
Lodge delegate to the British Masonic
Peace celebrations. He was 75 when he
passed out
Both of the new members of the Com-
monwealth Bank Board are sound men,
but they are widely different types. Peter
Tait, strong-faced, dynamic, quick in de-
cision, has a flair for grazing organisation,
and, as partner of the late James
Clark, was known from one end of pas-
toral Australia to the other. The holdings
of the pair were among the biggest and
best in the Commonwealth. Tait has taken
little part in public affairs, but in 1927 he
was a member of the Federal Commis-
sion of Inquiry into the pastoral industry.
He has a fine home at. Bowral, N.S.W.
A. F. Bell, appointed to the Common-
wealth Bank Board along with Peter Tait,
was a Brisbane Grammar boy, like A. C.
Davidson. He managed Robert Harper
and Co. in the North for many years
before becoming managing director for
Australia. In 1915-16 he was Quarter-
master-General in Queensland, leaving for
Victoria the following year. One of Aus-
tralia’s representatives at the first Econo-
mic Conference at Geneva, Bell helped
the Commonwealth to set up the Dried
Fruits Board, is a Victorian director of
the A.M.P. and is on the board of the
National Bank. He knows Australian in-
dustry and the commercial side of its
finance as well as any man living. But
he is a friendly person, with a great heart,
a pleasant face and a capacity for being
interested in everything and everybody.
Labor, which cries out for “humanity”
in bankers, has got a large helping of it
in A.F.B. He is 57 years old.
Dr. C. J. Kelleway, of the Eliza Hall
Institute in Melbourne, is a world autho-
rity on snakebite antidotes. On a recent
tour of investigation abroad he indulged
in his favorite pastime of looking for
dangerous reptiles, but only succeeded
in catching one specimen—a six-inch
viper. Kelleway was a guest of the

When the present board, headed by E. S.
Paul, took control about seven years ago
the co. was heading for the rocks. Now
policy-holders can look forward to
regular bonuses, which means that
shareholders’ prospects have been greatly
enhanced, too. Over the last half-
dozen years £248,172 has been distributed
in bonuses amongst policy-holders, share-
holders have had only £38,941 in divs.
averaging 1.8 p.c. (1| p.c. last year, and
nothing at all in ’3l and ’32), and no
less than £368,942 of establishment
charges has been rubbed out of the
accounts, purging them entirely of this
will-o’-the-wisp. In addition, substantial
sums have been written off for bad debts,
depreciation, etc., and the actuarial and
other reserves strengthened.
The year’s incomings (£365,478) ex-
ceeded outgoings including a
special charge of £24,735 to cover mort-
gage losses, etc.) by £78,568, which was
£l4OB lighter than the 1932 surplus. Of
the £78,568, £38,115 was sent to the
Assurance funds, £2334 net was added to
accident reserves (£12,942), £31,181 was
distributed amongst policy-holders in
bonuses ranging from 30s. p.c. to 50s. p.c.
on whole-of-life policies (the same as in
the previous year), £lOOO was struck off
the Canberra leasehold, and £4463 was
paid in dividends to shareholders.
In order to lower the rate of interest
which it is assumed the Assurance fund
will earn from 4 p.c. to 3f p.c., £13,000
has been transferred from general re-
serve (now £37,000), to the Assurance
fund, raising it to £2,501,538 at Sept. 30.
The aim is to ensure regular and better
bonuses in the future. After deducting
taxes (£31,419), last year’s net return on
the mean fund was 3.5 p.c.; with the re-
duction in taxation better can be ex-
pected.
In the Ordinary department slightly
less new business was put on the books,
but costs were further reduced:

p.c. in 1926. The year’s first premiums
were gathered at a cost of 153 p.c. as
against 157 p.c. and 169 p.c. for the two
preceding terms ; that is assuming that
new business is 10 times more expensive
than old. Surrenders (£42,497) were
lower by one-third.
The year’s growth in the Assurance
fund was £84,630, and in net tangibles
£57,221. The difference is due to the
reduction in the assumed rate of interest
and to the writing off already referred
to:

Loans on policies were £20,535 lower,
and no fresh advances were made on
mortgage. All the money which became
available was . invested in Government
stocks (up £99,179). The board proposes
to continue this policy, because legisla-
tion in N. S. Wales, and the Court's in-
terpretation thereof, “in no wise places
mortgages in the category of safe trustee
securities.”
After deducting the Assurance fund,
shareholders could see the whole of their
capital intact and £72,573 besides. The
market, which realises that few invest-
ments turn out better than a well-handled
life office in the long run, expresses its
confidence in the management by paying
11s. sd. for the 10s. paid shares.

Though this snug little offshoot of the
Mercantile Mutual wrote a bit less busi-
ness again last year, the quality was
better, and so was the net result, which
reached 13.3 p.c. on capital as against
11.6, a loss, 9.3, 25.3 and 26.9 p.c.
back to 1928. So another couple of
points were added to the div., lifting it to
8 p.c., which was more than covered by
returns from investments alone (£5871,
up £296), thus leaving the underwriting
surplus available to nourish investments
and the returns therefrom.
Since the co. pulled out of the trouble-
some London marine business, which
was mainly responsible for the loss in
’3l, and now that trading generally is a
bit more settled, underwriting results are
beginning to improve, notwithstanding a
shrinkage in net premium income:

Last year activities were extended to
Hobart and Perth, and the loss rate
was easily the best since the co. began
to write policies direct with the
public eight years ago—it was solely a
reinsurance concern for 17 years before
that. There was little change in the ex-
pense rate, and the underwriting surplus
(£4769) was twice as good as the pre-
vious year’s. Shareholders’ prospects
largely depend upon the future of under-
writing performances.
Policy-holders are well protected. At
the end of December they could see net
tangibles equal to 185 p.c. of the year’s
net premiums, whereas 150 p.c. is usually
considered adequate. Funds are held in
this way:

The market prices the pound shares
paid to 7s. at 13s. 6d. as against Bs. 9d.
a year ago. The return at 13s. 6d. is
4.1 p.c. on an 8 p.c. div. basis. Visibly

Capital was doubled by the bonus issue
of 1919, raising it to its present figure
(£600,000). Divs. averaged 8.7 p.c. for
the seven years to the close of accounts
in 1925 ; for the next seven the average
was 2.5 p.c., aggregate losses exceeded
aggregate profits by £70,376, and
£lOO,OOO of inner reserves was disclosed.
Then shareholders appointed an investi-
gation committee, which found that large
bonuses had been paid to executives, and
that no specific allowance had been made
for depreciation for the 10 years 1922-31.
A new set of directors was appointed,
and the co. now shows its best profit
(£79,995 = 12.5 p.c. on capital) for
the last 13 years. Shareholders were
handed 5 p.c., of which 1 p.c. was
labelled bonus, leaving £48,180 to put in
the cupboard.
The accounts are still presented in the
old form, which obscures a clear view of
the co.’s position. What amount, if any,
was allowed for depreciation is not men-
tioned, nor is the extent to which im-
provement may have been due to savings
visible. Both lamb and mutton prices
strengthened, and so did the market for
pelts and wool. But the lamb-and-
mutton freezing and export trade is a
tricky business. In the overcrowded Can-
terbury (M.L.) markets competition is
fierce, while at Smithfield (Eng.), where
the co. sells its products, it has to com-
pete with Argentine exporters. Thus small
fluctuations in lamb and mutton prices
are liable to play havoc with earnings,
as the figures over the last half-dozen
years clearly show.
Hopes are that the Ottawa agreements
and improvement in trade generally will
narrow price fluctuations and, with the
stopping up of some of the outlets, lead
to steadier earnings in the future. The
market, therefore, prices the fully-paid
pound shares at par as against 10s. 3d. a
year ago. The backing is 225.. 1 Id. in
net tangibles, all plant, etc., worth what
it can earn.
Here is the position as balance-sheet

£109,078 over the twelvemonth.

This co.’s figures reflect conditions in the
real-estate market. Here the peak period
was 1926-28, when many properties
changed hands two and even three times,
owing to the activity of American and
other speculators. Presently the well from
which most of the loan funds were
drawn began to dry up ; then slump and,
above all, the penal legislation of the
Lang Government destroyed confidence,
including the confidence of mortgagees,
in the future of property as an invest-
ment. Thus, in 1931, the value of city
property sales in Sydney had fallen as
low as 5.2 p.c. of the 1926 figure ; in the
suburbs the ’3l sales were about 10 p.c.
of the peak figure of 1928:

The improvement shown over the last
two years has been due to (1) efforts
of the State Government to mitigate the
effects of Lang’s legislation, (2) slight
reduction in taxation and (3) improve-
ment in the outlook generally. While
shop rents in the central city area have ad-
vanced, the price of factory and office
space leaves little profit with values as
they are. Owing to the influence of the
Harbor Bridge and delay in completing
the City Railway, properties between
Bridge-street and Circular Quay and be-
tween York-street and Darling Harbor
are a problem to their owners these days.
Though Richardson and Wrench got
its fair share of the larger business,
gross earnings (£17,455) were £374
lighter. But a saving of £l2OO in exes.
(£16,368) left the net result £826 better
at £lOB7, equal to a shade over 2 p.c. on
capital, and for the third time in suc-
cession shareholders were passed by. For
the decade to the close of accounts in
1930 divs. averaged 20.6 p.c. ; but that
is no guide to the future of this class
of business.
The market, which notes the co.’s ex-
tensive goodwill, of which no account is
taken in the books, and the better out-
look, prices the 15s. paid shares at 20s.
9d. The return at that price would be
4.3 p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis. The back-
ing is 17s. sd. in net tangibles.
If advances are of the readily realisable
nature, practically all the co.’s assets are

After a two-year wait shareholders have
come into the picture again (2} p.c. was
distributed), thanks to a profit of £6301
on the sale of land. The trading
profit (£185), though £3803 better than
the previous year’s result, was not good
enough to pay a div. Still, there has been
a steady increase in business since the
close of accounts, the chairman says, and
the co.’s art pottery, manufacture of
which began a couple of years ago, has
won a market throughout the Common-
wealth and Maoriland.
Earnings, however, depend mainly
upon conditions in the building trade,
the brick-making section being the one
most affected. What has happened in
this respect is clearly illustrated in the
next table, which shows the value of
building permits issued for Greater Mel-
bourne over the last five years:
Year to Value of Index
Dec.,’3l, permits. 1929 = 100.
1929 £7,212,777 100.00
1930 2,739,576 37.98
1931 1,125,901 15.62
1932 2,438,616 33.81
1933 3,308,882 45.88
In 1931 the value of permits issued was
no more than 15.6 p.c. of the 1929 figure ;
Hoffman’s practically ceased manufactur-
ing bricks and tiles, and losses instead of
profits began to show up. Though the
value of last year’s permits had recov-
ered to 45.8 p.c. of the 1929 figure, com-
petition was exceedingly keen, and seems
likely to remain so. That is pretty cer-
tain to mean moderate earnings in the
future, so boom-time performances, when
divs. climbed as high as 16| p.c., had
best be forgotten. A heartening feature
is that, of the growth of £870,266 in the
value of last year’s permits, £740,633 was
in respect of the December half, and
there has been no slackening in activity
since, thanks largely to the rise in wool
prices, a little relief from taxation and
better feeling about things generally.
The market, therefore, prices the
pound shares at 19s. as against 14s. a
year ago. At 19s. the investor who looks
for a shade over 4 p.c. on his money (a
low return on this class of stock) counts
on a 4 p.c. div. (= £7701 p.a.). The
backing is 255. 6d. in net tangibles, mostly
plant, worth what it can earn.

Excluding shares in other cos., but in-
cluding stocks, the year’s improvement
in the more or less liquid surplus
(£59,403) was £11,609. On fixed assets
£5193 more was written off than was
spent, which suggests that the small vis-
ible allowance for depreciation (£467 last
year) is not the only provision therefor.

The A.M.P. is as
strong as the nation
SEEKING, recently, to impress a young couple
with the strength and the solidity of the Society,
an A.M.P. representative said: “It is as strong as
the nation itself.” He did not exaggerate. With its
£92,000,000 worth of assets the Society is an integral
part of the nation’s life and strength. Its roots go down
so deeply in Australian soil that it might be said to be
part of the Commonwealth itself.
The A.M.P. was founded before the first railway was
built in Australia, before the first telegraph line was
erected, before Tasmania was so named. It has played
its part all through the nation’s struggles. Since 1849
it has paid out £120,000,000 to policyholders or their
representatives. Its members hold to-day policies
(including bonuses) to a total of £260,000,000.
The man who assures in the A.M.P. becomes a member
of what an English paper recently called “one of the
greatest financial institutions in the world.” There is
no better way in which to invest his money than in
the A.M.P.
A copy of a book called “Investing in Happiness,”
which tells how the Society helps its members, will be
posted oh request, or an experienced officer will be
sent to discuss details of policies.

the end of the war, things looked so rosy
that not only was the written off capital
restored, but £25,000 was added. Thus, in
one leap, capital bounded from £45,000
to £lOO,OOO, at which figure it has
remained.
For the decade to the close of accounts
in 1929, divs. averaged 5.5 p.c., equal to
12.2 p.c. on capital as it stood before the
writing up. But slump, acute competition
and exchange and primage made the busi-
ness unprofitable, and shareholders have
gone without for the last four years. One
problem has been to get overhead back;
the specialty house and small-job printer
can nearly always quote a bit less than
the general stationer.
Gross earnings, which were £44,841 in
1928, were £26,245 last year, when the
improvement was £2013. The net loss
(£356), which was £4607 lighter than the
previous year’s, was all incurred during
the first half. Trading for the second
half resulted in a profit, the board says,
and conditions have continued to improve
since. Also, the fact that the shop is in
George-street, opposite Wynyard station,
has helped to minimise any shrinkage
in the value of the freehold (it was
bought nearly nine years ago), and to
provide the management with fresh
opportunities to strengthen the co.’s
goodwill.
The following table shows the extent
to which unprofitable trading, etc., has
eaten into the more or less liquid surplus,
which improved £2734 last year:

The floating debt consists of an over-
draft of £8959 (up £3766) and £4732
(down £1401) coming to sundry creditors.
The mortgage (£16,600) and debenture
money (£22,500, carrying 7 p.c.) was got
in to finance purchase of the George-
street property, in at £49,554. Plant, etc.,
figures at £35,133 net, down £2690 dur-
ing the year.
The market, which expects share-
holders to get a dividend during the cur-
rent term, prices the pound shares at 10s.
as against 4s. 6d. a year ago. At 10s. the
return would be p.c. on a 2\ p.c. div.,
which would call for £2500. The book
value of the cover is 19s. 9d. in net tan-
gibles.
Gold
Since the end of 1933 the sterling price
of gold has risen from £6 6s. 3d. an ounce
to £6 19s. 6d., and it may go a trifle
higher yet. The rise is due to President
Roosevelt’s decision to bid up for the
metal by devaluing the gold content of
the dollar by approximately 40 p.c. That
is to say, whereas an ounce of fine gold
used to be worth 20.67 dollars, it is now
worth 35 dollars. If an ounce of fine gold
is to be permanently worth 35 dollars,
and if Britain keeps in step, then the
equivalent sterling price would be
approximately £7 3s. 10d., equal to £8
19s. Bd. in Australian currency (subject
to freight and insurance charges etc.), so
long as £lOO sterling continues to be ex-
changed for £125 Australian pounds. As
for exchange rates, if Britain and the
U.S.A. each devalued the gold content of
their currency units by exactly the same
amount, then sterling and the dollar
would continue to bear the same relation
to one another as they used to in terms of
gold.
At the moment, the fact is that the
dollar has been artificially forced down in
terms of gold. While this state of affairs
continues, and while the U.S.A. is con-
tent to buy all the gold offered to her, so
long will the metal enjoy an artificially
high price and continue to flow to the
U.S.A., unless, of course, barriers are
placed in the way of the flow. Until the
effect of the Roosevelt plan upon Ameri-
can prices becomes known, the relation-
ship between sterling and the dollar
remains uncertain. Meanwhile there is a
possibility that France and the rest of
the gold bloc may be forced off the gold
standard ; much depends upon this.
Speaking broadly, the value of a cur-
rency is what it will buy in its own coun-
try. In the long run, therefore, the
general level of internal prices and the
flow of external trade are very important
factors in determining the exchange value
of currencies, but they are not the only
ones. One thing that does seem certain
is that, when the price of gold ultimately
settles down, it will be far above the old
statutory figure of £4 4s. per fine
ounce. The inevitable result of it all has,
of course, been a boom in gold-mining
shares.
New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd., an-
nounces a working profit of £130,279 for
the 12 months to Sept. 30 last, which,
with £84,906 brought forward, makes
available £215,185. The directors recom-
mend a dividend of 4 p.c. (9.6 d. per
share), payable out of the accumulated
profits. Mining Trust, which dominates
the list of shareholders, is paying up 19s.
each on 375,000 of the shares it holds in
New Guinea Goldfields, and approxi-
mately £250,000 of the money is ex-
pected to be received in March. When
the cash is available shareholders will be
called together and asked to pass the
dividend. Mining Trust last week offered
its London shareholders 1,000,000 New
Guinea Goldfields shares at ss. 3d. each,
presumably to meet the call made by
New Guinea Goldfields.

Mt. Peter goldfield, Cairns (N.Q.),
crushed 181 tons for 3060 z. gold during
December. The Talisman, which weighed
in with 1680 z., has been a consistent pro-
ducer of 3oz. ore. It has broken through
into old workings, and all available ore
has been stoped until a new adit is com-
pleted. The Mt. Peter Extended is
working again on a well-defined reef, but
values only bulk about 6dwt. This ore
is crushed locally, but the high-grade stuff
goes to Chillagoe.
* * * *
The Just-in-Time, Hodgkinson field
(N.Q.), of which Dr. R. L. Jack had a
favorable opinion in the pioneering days,
has been taken up by Amos Jones, a
well-known N.Q. prospector. Prior to
1883 it produced nearly 4000 oz. of gold
from stone averaging 30dwt. per ton. The
ore was found in separate shoots over a
length of 400 ft. to a depth of about 120 ft.
The lode has not yet been thor-
oughly tested. Provided capital is avail-
able for prospecting, the co. appears to
have a good chance. Production gener-
ally on the Hodgkinson was confined to
high-grade shoots in separated lenses, and
the total production to 1885 was not
negligible.
* * * *
An unusually good prospector’s report
comes from Kolongo, in the Bundaberg
(Q.) district, where two fossickers dis-
closed slugs of gold in lode formation
to a depth of 15ft. A syndicate is being
formed to give the ground a thorough
test.
* * * *
Bewick, Moreing and Co. has taken an
option from Victoria Alluvials over 2000
acres of dredging ground on the Lisle
field (Tas.), and investigation thereof has
commenced. This field was the scene of
much activity in the early ’eighties, and
some 250,0000 z. of alluvial gold was re-
covered from a patch not exceeding a
mile and a half square. No reefs have
been found either in the valley itself or
in the surrounding hills.
* * * *
Siamese Tin Syndicate, which is work-
ing large areas at St. Helens (Tas.), will
have its first clean-up this month. The
ground takes in the St. George’s River
and Argonaut tinmines and a farm em-
bracing river flats. Water is brought in
by a race, through very difficult country,
from St. Columbia Falls, about 30 miles
away. Within four days of completion
of the last piece of fluming, 30 sluice-
heads were ready. It is the largest and
most complete alluvial tin-mining propo-
sition in the Speck, and has taken nearly
three years to get to the producing stage.
* * * *
Plant additions, in progress and con-
templated, on Westralia’s Golden Mile
mean that a larger quantity of water will
be wanted, and the matter is causing the
Government and mineowners some con-
cern. The extra water required cannot be
provided without renovating and streng-
thening the existing pipe-line from the
distant Mundaring reservoir ; and without
further supply the enlarged plants
couldn’t work to capacity, and develop-
ment would have to be curtailed. The
Government is hard pressed for cash, so
the aid of the Loan Council may be
sought.

Princess Royal Co. has paid £lOOO for
an option over the Salvation lease at Mc-
Kenzie’s Find, Grant’s Patch, near Ora
Banda, and has agreed to dub up a
further £15,000 on July 29, if it completes
the deal. To date £16,000, extracted from
1237 tons, has come out of the show, and
400 tons of high-grade ore on hand will
be crushed shortly. Also, Western Mining
Corp. has taken 80 acres at Meekatharra
on approval, and intends to do some bor-
ing. A lot of gold was taken from old
mines within this area in by-gone days.
* * * *
Paringa (W.A.) has struck something at
a depth of about 700 ft. on its hitherto
little-developed block at the north end of
the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile. The co.
spent most of its capital years ago sinking
a main shaft to 1300 ft. and installing a
winding plant. During the past 30 years
tributors have taken several thousands of
ounces of gold from mostly shallow
workings.
* * * *
Ora Banda South, backed by Sydney
speculators, has acquired and hopes to
make its fortune out of the old Orinda
mine at Ora Banda (W.A.). Reference
is made to the 2000-odd oz. of gold which
has been extracted from the property, but
it is what has been left, not what has been
taken out, that counts.

SHADOW SHOWS.
With its settings and types “Two
Minutes Silence,” at the Civic, might
have been made in England, and its un-
relieved slowness is Elstreeish too.
However, many of the characters do
manage to mirror human behavior. Leo
Franklyn’s private, Frank Bradley’s gen-
eral and Ethel Gabriel’s char. are par-
ticularly good. Frank Leighton is often
theatrical before he shakes down and
gives a pathetically realistic repre-
sentation of a shell-shocked officer.
Campbell Copelin is the chief disappoint-
ment. He looks like a movie star in
his role of French officer.
The characters whose war memories are
revived by the chimes of Armistice Day

at Sydney Regent.
are seen before the general’s fireplace—
the char, who gave her son ; the gen-
eral who sent tired men out to fight
and fight again ; the governess (Marie
Lorraine) who gave All to an unworthy
lover; the butler who was down and
out before the general saved him.
Given a well-equipped studio the Mc-
Donagh sisters might turn out a film that
the world would enjoy. Here they
haven’t made a movie out of a play ; they
have simply photographed a play. The
camera is focussed on one setting in
shot after shot, and the players seek the
camera’s eye instead of being sought by
it. Occurrences that could have been
vividly impressed on the mind by flashes
and close-ups are treated as happenings
“off” and are lengthily discussed. As
a result the ear isn’t captured and the
wandering eye observes discrepancies.
“The Love Nest” provides Gene Ger-
rard with sumptuous surroundings in
which to make an ass of himself. He is,
if anything, more boring and incredible
than before as a bridegroom-to-be who
is let in for spending the night with
a married woman. His prospective in-
laws (one of whom is formidable Amy
Veness) ramp in the offing as usual,
together with a jealous, revolver-flourish-
ing husband. In brief, it is an English
farcical comedy.
* # #
“Before Dawn,” at the Plaza, is an
Edgar Wallace thriller with some genuine
thrills. You know the villain from the
beginning. Warner Oland, a Viennese
doctor whose benevolent spectacles and
suave voice mask desperate criminality,
finishes off a dying gangster and journeys
to America in search of deceased’s
hidden gold. Who will get the million
dollars’ worth of bullion? A couple
of old women, friends of the departed,
lose their lives. (They live in the grim
old house where the gold is concealed ;
one of those mechanistic dwellings that
turn the thoughts of Sydney unionists to
Trades Hall ballot-boxes.) The fawther
of lovely little Dorothy Wilson is also
sent to face a disapproving Maker. (He
tried to steal the money, and she, though
clairvoyant, nobly refused to help.)
Stuart Erwin, lumpish as ever, comes into
her life as a detective. He arrives in
the nick of time as Oland is trying to
throw her down a well.
The merits of the production, which is
likely to serve as a model for future
ooh-ooh films, British and American, are
largely negative. No eerie howls to
speak of, no terrific thunderstorm, no low-
comedy maidservant, no idiot police-
man. The acting is restrained, and the
dialogue has been sub-edited down to the
irreducible minimum.
“The Road to Romance” shows Ann
Harding as a famous surgeon. She is
sick of work, and longs for Life —mean-
ing night-club life. Her charm for the
men she meets in her new environment
is understandable, apart from her beau-
tiful head and profile. A matter of
novelty. She has the broad-beamed
figure, swinging gait and direct gaze of
a golf associate on a lowish mark ; in
short, she is the antithesis of an Ameri-
can B.Y.T. Small wonder that Robert
Young, a grinning moron with an aero-
plane in which he delights to joy-fly,
should become temporarily infatuated.
His ideal, till she appeared, had been
Sari Maritza, a roystering half-wit like
himself. Ann becomes infatuated, too.
They are married, disillusionment fol-
lows, and she turns for comfort to faith-
ful Nils Asther.
A good old story, but the producer
has spoiled it by his melodramatic tricks.
There are a tiresome invalid child; a
gorgeous wedding, with Asther and Miss
Maritza agonising in prominent posi-
tions ; and other cheap devices for win-

ning the facile sniff. Robert Young is
the blot on the proceedings. He isn’t
engagingly boyish. An eminent woman
doctor would have identified him as a
seasoned philanderer at a glance.
“The Invisible Man” has arrived at
Sydney Capitol. Carl Laemmle and his
merry men have taken wide liberties with
the text and, in doing so, have robbed the
story of much of its qualities of plausi-
bility.
Wells made the mixture comedy 4,
tragedy 1, and related the facts in the
impartial, matter-of-fact style of a first-
class reporter. Hollywood introduces a
heroine who is as much a stage prop, as
the assistant to a conjurer, and handicaps
the salient angles of the plot with an
Americanised view of English life. Police

Sydney Plaza.
discipline, organisation and officers’ uni-
forms follow the rules of Centre-street,
and in the taproom of a village inn there
are barrels inscribed respectively “Rye”
and “Whiskey.” Nevertheless, Claude
Rains, billed as the invisible man —his face
is seen for only two seconds at the fade-
out —is represented throughout by an
authentic Oxford accent.
The effects of invisibility are efficiently
done, yet the production leaves an im-
pression of great opportunities frittered
away.
Slim Summerville and Zasu Pitts pre-
sent an Americanised version of Bardell
v. Pickwick, with the “chops and tomato
sauce” translated into a vegetarian deli-
cacy referred to as “cream carrots.”
Summerville is Sergeant Buzfuz; Miss
Pitts is Mrs. Bardell. The fantasia is
called “Love, Honor and Oh Baby,” and
it shows that it is just as well American
bankers, have their noses kept to the
grindstone by the ruses of Roosevelt.
In their spare time, it seems, they are apt
to fall victims to unusually clumsy black-
mailers.

“White Woman,” at the Regent, dis-
closes Carole Lombard as an expensively
attired crooner in a Malayan cafe. She
is about to be deported when Charles
Laughton, a brutal Cockney, marries and
takes her to the jungle, where he lords it
over thousands of- oppressed Malayans
arid a handful of degenerate whites. She
bolts with a lover a couple of jumps
ahead of a native uprising, and the picture
is saved. Laughton’s drunken bravado as
he meets his fate at the hands of the
savages is a fine climax. With skilled
economy of voice and gestures Laughton
makes the flash Cockney a live and con-
vincing figure. Charles Bickford, as a
reckless outcast, fills second place.
Barbara Stanwyck is heroine of “Ever
in My Heart.” She marries a German
(Otto Kruger) against the wishes of her
New England family. Comes the war,
and the couple experience every kind of
misery—social ostracism, poverty, the
death of their little son. They even see
their dead child’s pet dachshund stoned
to death by patriotic neighbors. The
sentimentalism is ghastly, but as a ser-
mon on the susceptibility of mobs to
propaganda it is great stuff.
So they separate, and she goes to
France and he becomes a German spy,
and they come together again—but go to
the Regent yourself and see the most
lachrymose finish that has been shown
on the screen for many a day. Kruger
is over-emotional, and Miss Stanwyck’s
early restraint is thrown to the wind as
the tears begin to fall.
Sundry Shows
The A.B.C.’s military band, brought
into being by that model of English
bandmasters Capt. H. E. Adkins, occu-
pied Sydney Town Hall on Saturday
afternoon and evening. The programme
was the same for both audiences, and
it catered for all sorts of musical taste.
There was vigorous drama in the “Wil-
liam Tell” overture, a Sousa march and
Percy Fletcher’s “Spirit of Pageantry” ;
mysticism in the first movement of
Schumann’s A Minor Concerto (Henri
Penn at the piano); amorous romance in
Drigo’s “Serenade”; comedy in “The
Three Bears” of Eric Coates and selec-
tions from “The Mikado,” and patriotic
stimulant in “Episodes from a Soldier’s
Life,” a fantasia introducing many well-
known airs. At night the hall was
crowded ; at the end applause was deafen-
ing and Capt. Adkins had to make a
speech. The National Anthem didn’t
send the audience home and “Auld Lang
Syne,” with some of the bandsmen play-
ing and others singing, wound up one of
the most successful concerts Sydney,
always generous in its appreciation, has
seen in the last decade.

Christa Winsloe’s “Children in Uni-
form,” performed at Sydney Savoy on
Saturday by the Independent Theatre
Group, is the story of a vivacious girl’s
reaction to the stern discipline of a Prus-
sian academy for the daughters of in-
digent army officers. The girl, Manuela,
resents the shabby uniform she has to
wear, the taboo on sweets and light read-
ing, the censoring of correspondence, the
dreary prisonlike routine ; but one of the
teachers is kind. Manuela gets drunk and
publicly declares her affection for Frau-
lein von Bernburg. She is placed in
isolation, is reproved by the object of
her adoration, and commits suicide. The
play has about 30 speaking parts. Jean
Elwing, as Manuela, Doris Fitton, as
Fraulein von Bernburg, and Gertrude
Maurice Chevalier, in “The Way to
Love,” at Sydney Prince Edward.
Johns, as one of the martinets, bore the
brunt of the acting. The Independents’

ABORIGINALITIES
“Val”: I first met “Counter Joe” on a
tin-dredging show in Siam. He was the
rigger and I the new assayer. Seated on
his bungalow verandah after makan, I
approached him to learn some Malay.
“Sh! or I’ll lose count,” he hissed, and
continued to gaze at the clearing. “That
grassy makes seventeen and there’s a
black cobra, eighteen. The python over
by the creek makes nineteen. Snakes are
scarce since they started riveting the new
pontoon. In the early days I could count
’em with both hands like sheep through
a gap.” We came to Melbourne and en-
listed together when the Great War broke
out. On the troopship he would stand
at the rail and tick off porpoises with his
fingers. We next met in France, when
he told me he’d been getting into trouble
for breaking the rule about not looking
up when enemy aircraft appeared. He
had to count ’em. The last time I saw
him he was stripped to the waist, shirt on
knees and tobacco-tin beside him. At
the sound of my voice, he lifted his gaze
from his collection of chats. “Well, I’m
blowed, so you’re still alive! —997-
“Dad, what makes the world go round and round?”
“You brat, have you found my whisky?”
998” Then we all ducked. He
wriggled his way out of the debris. “Blast
Fritz,” he said. “I don’t mind losing the
tin, but where’s me shirt? I only wanted
two for a tally.”
* * * ♦
“A.E.L.”: The Afghan camel-dealer
could show the cleverest horse-coper a
trick or two. Once in the Leonora
(W.A.) district, my father advertised for
a young camel. Twenty were brought for
inspection: all fine-looking animals, but
fat. After a proper amount of de-
liberation and bargaining my dad
selected the leanest —and it was a shade
too plump. Next morning, when he
went to look at his fat camel, he found
a living skeleton, on whose almost flesh-
less bones the skin hung in large folds.
The beast had been inflated. An incision
about an inch in length had been made
in each ear, between the skin and the
flesh. Into this a small tube was fitted
and secured by a silk cord. There it re-
mained, hidden from the observation of
all but the initiated, and ready for use
at any moment. When a buyer hove in
sight the dealer took
two tubes, each a
yard long, inserted
one end of each in the
small tubes concealed
in the camel’s ears,
and two Afghans
blew through the
other ends with all
their might until the
animal attained a cor-
pul e n t appearance.
The tubes were then
withdrawn and the air
retained for a while
by corks smeared
with pitch.
* *
“Olla”: In the long
ago I was buggy-driv-
ing on a tour of in-
spection of Momba
station with one of
the directors, Peter
Waite. A bull camel,
in attempting to clear
a high fence, came a
cropper and broke his
leg. Waite immediately jumped down,
killed the camel and hacked off its
hump. “What do you intend to do
with that?” asked I. “Do with it?” says
he. “First of all, we will have a feed of
it. Then I shall send the rest to my
Adelaide Club friends —they will enjoy
it. Why, man alive, don’t you know this
meat is worth 255. a pound in France?”
That evening I raised sufficient courage
to tackle “a small serve” ; it was so good
that I have been wishing for more ever
since.
* * * *
“Verri”: With the heavy rains that fell
over eastern N. S. Wales a few weeks ago
came a large crop of mushrooms. The
inhabitants of the villages, old and other-
wise, used to go out on early-morn
rambles and collect the fungi until the
heat-wave ended the harvest. A resident
of Goulburn left his excursion pretty
late, went far afield, and returned with-
out a single mushroom. He was sitting
on his balcony that afternoon when an
urchin from the back street arrived.
“Please, mister,” quoth he, “kin me an’
me brother git them things growin’ up
your back section.” As the back section
is waste land and usually grows nothing
more profitable than thistles, permission
was readily given. Ten minutes later the
householder blinked furiously as “me an’
me brother” passed out with two baskets
of beautiful mushrooms.

“Esorcus”: Tell “Barang” (B. 17/1/’34)
Australia needs no instruction on the
subject of the tachinid fly. The beetle
(Lepidiota albohirtum ) which, in the lar-
val stage, is the scourge of Queensland
canefields apparently does not occur in
Hawaii, and it is not parasitised by the
tachinid. In Hawaii, the major pest was the
“ ’Ere, missus, yer dawg bit me.”
“How terrible! I was always told Precious would be run over, and now he’s
POISONED.”
cane-beetle borer, Rhabdocnemis obscura,
and Dr. Muir found both host and
its tachinid parasite. The parasite was
found to have a comparatively short
life cycle and to be sensitive to the condi-
tions of shipboard travel, and it was
necessary to establish intermediate breed-
ing stations at Mossman (Q.) and Suva.
Dr. Illingworth, then entomologist to the
Queensland Bureau of Sugar Experiment
Stations, noted that the tachinids liberated
by Muir about 1910 had become well
established in the Mossman district by
1917. Since then the bureau has made
systematic distributions of the parasite in
other districts to which it had not natur-
ally spread. The position in Queensland
is that, although the borer is a potential
menace, it is so well controlled by the
tachinid that the annual damage done is
inconsiderable.

“G.L.T.”: I’m going to have it framed.
It’s a letter that came in yesterday’s post
—covered with blots and garnished with
strange oaths, but it shines as a good
deed in a naughty world. I had agreed
to buy the horse ; the dealer said it was
rising seven, sound in wind and limb,
a good worker and broken to saddle
and harness. It looked all right, too.
Then came the letter from the vendor:
You have had a rough spin the same as me
or I would not have told you. The horse is
19, co.ming 20. His offside hind leg swells
like hell when he gets a bit of work, and if
you work him he will crack up in less than
a fortnight. If you are crimson fool enough
to take him, don’t blame me.

“Captain Tyarki”: Despite “Lugger’s
Mate” (B. 10/1/’34), the giant clam does
trap human beings. Working along the
reefs of New Caledonia I came across the
yawl Ideale, owned by the Maison Audet
and manned by Japanese. The reef was
almost bare, and, noticing the Japanese
crowding about one spot on the coral, I
went over to see what was amiss. One
of the divers was trapped by a clam, and
his countrymen were working to free him.
This they did with the aid of a pinchbar
and a long knife. I was told that some
time before a boy called Wahme, who
had worked for Audet, had been trapped
by a clam and drowned. A few years
afterwards, whilst diving for black-lip and
trochus among the islands and atolls
around the coast of Neu Pommern I saw
a German planter trapped. My tenders
pulled me to the surface to tell me of it,
and he was then struggling in about
four feet of water. A flooding tide
drowned him as we were trying to prise
the shell apart sufficiently to enable the
boy to use his knife. Next victim I saw
was a native named Lalik, employed by
the German New Guinea Co. in Kavi-
eng, N. 1., as light-boy on the wharf.
He was sent down to find the chain of
a small channel light that had broken
adrift. The task was difficult, and Lalik
was sent down again and again until, at
last, he failed to come to the surface. At
daybreak next morning I recovered what
the barracouta, ribbonfish and loche had
left, and sent it to the surface with one
leg fast in the huge, serrated jaws of a
half-ton clam. I have often stuck a spear
into the flesh of a clam, holding the shell
apart with the sah-gi while my boy slid
the blade of his knife through the muscle,
but I have never been able to get close
enough to touch the flesh of one with my
hand before it closed.
“H.D.”: “Kopina Kava’s” par. (B.
27/12/’33) tells us nothing that has not
been known for generations. The use of
bull-roarers, tom-toms, drums, etc., is
practised in many countries other than
Papua. For local transmission the sound-
ing-board will do what “K.K.” states, but
sending a message over hostile country
is another pair of sleeves. If such an
obvious means could have been used
Staniforth Smith and party need not
have been . lost for weeks in the
Western Division. If it is true that mes-
sages are sent by sound only, how can
one account for the death of Arkawaia
being known here in Milne Bay immedi-
ately after his being killed by a falling
tree on Woodlark Island, hundreds of
miles away? And how can one explain
the death of Armit, 400 miles from
Samarai, being known there six hours
after it occurred? A Government official,
still in' the country, was camped on a
small island in the Trobriands. At 8 p.m.
he heard a number of voices speaking of
the death of an inmate of the hospital
14 miles away. On his return to head-
quarters he was told the patient had
died at that very hour. A man I know
who has lived with the natives and speaks
their dialect as well as they do themselves,
and has had training as an anthropologist,
is convinced that the native retains a
sense or power that has been lost to the
white man.
* * * *
“Oran”: The wife of a farmer near
Goulburn (N.S.W.) had been worried by
foxes taking her fowls. The brutes were
wary and avoided traps, so the henhouse
was rebuilt and the door carefully
fastened at dusk. One night she remem-
bered the door had been left open, and
somewhere around midnight went out to
secure it. On opening it in the morning
she was almost knocked down by a leap-
ing red-brown form that hurled itself past
her and streaked away over the hill. Not
a chook was injured: the fox had evi-
dently sneaked into the pen a second be-
fore the door was closed the night before,
and his terror on finding himself trapped
had ensured the other inmates immunity
from attack.
* * * *
“Bumpk”: The horse-slashing maniac
is always with us, but a new variety of
the horror has made his appearance in
Melbourne. Recently the Zoo’s veteran
hippo, sickened and died. Post-mortem re-
vealed that it had swallowed a tennis ball
which had caused a complete stoppage in
its intestines. Director Wilkie fortified the
cage with chain wire at a cost of several
hundred pounds, but the other day a
half ball was found inside which had
been doubled up and squeezed through
the interstices. This suggests that some
perverted person has designs on the re-
maining innocents. Half a tennis ball
could easily spell mortality even for a
hippo, if it stuck in the throat and formed
an air pocket.
SONG OF AN EXILE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It s a clear night with an old moon, and, tracing
a star-decked sky,
With rhythmic drone and a soft purr a hurry-
ing ’plane goes by.
And there comes to me a futile wish to be
with that lone sky-rover
Jn a long flight on a straight course, and my
days, of exile over.
I long to look at the old town as it gazes out
to the sea;
The crooked ways and the little streets that
straggle down to the Quay;
The stuccoed walls of the grand homes and
the painted roofs on the heights;
And the broad lawns and the green sward and
the twinkle of Harbor lights.
Give me the blare of the brass bands and the
gaudy halls and the show;
The lights’ flare and the bright signs with their
dazzling rainbow glow;
And a long draught of old red wine and dawn
in the east soon after,
And a glad eye or a wry smirk and a drunken
sailor’s laughter.
I want to watch the big ships come by the
roads of the open sea,
And see them ride to the harborside and camp
in security.
And the mixed crowd on the gangway, all
eager, shoulder to shoulder;
But the ships come and the ships go, and I
grow older and older.

“FIY”: How is this for a droving re-
cord? The hero started on the road in
N.Q. lately with nine horses, three
blackboys, a dog and 500 steers and bul-
locks, for a 70-mile trip. He lost all the
cattle, also the blackboys and the horses,
including his own horse and saddle ; he
lost all the packs, tucker and gear; he
also lost his dog; and if the owner’s
fierce thoughts could kill he would have
lost his life. He did lose his job. How
did he manage it? Simple. The route
went through a township that sported a
pub.
“How’s the blight this year?”
“The ? Aw, she’s expectin’ another!”
“L.E.8.”: “Go and hitch up the
ostrich! ” is not at all an absurd com-
mand on an ostrich farm. When I lived
in South Africa we often harnessed the
big birds to a carriage. They make fairly
good substitutes for horses ; though they
cannot draw a heavy load their speed is
remarkable. We had one bird called
Oliver that could run a mile in 2min.
22sec. and keep it up for an hour or so.
Once a cyclist with a good road-racing
record tried to pass Oliver on a long,
smooth stretch of road. He came up
behind the carriage, thinking to get ahead
and escape the dust. Oliver thought dif-
ferently. He threw his head high in
the air, gave a flap with his, wings, and
went forward with a speed that astonished
the cyclist. Putting forth more effort, the
latter made another attempt to pass the
ostrich, but the faster the pedals of the
bicycle moved, the faster sped the long
legs of the bird; and the cyclist had to
accept defeat.

“Larrapinta”: What has become of ail
the calfskin waistcoats, once the pride
of bushmen? The man
who wished to make one
took the skin of a new-
born bull calf. The more
vividly it was marked the
better, and one spotted
like a leopard was a prize
indeed. It was tanned
with wattle-bark; and
after tanning the flesh side
was scraped with a blunt
knife, and the still damp
skin was stretched and
rubbed between the hands
for hours, so that when
dry it was as soft as kid.
Roomy pockets were a
feature of the waistcoat,
quondong seeds or shil-
lings were used as buttons,
and it was donned when-
ever the wearer went to
the township or to have
a Sunday afternoon yarn
to some bloke who had two or three
attractive daughters. The garment was
mighty hot in summer, even when worn
unbuttoned, but on cold nights it was
splendid for a long ride. I’ve an idea
that the fashion was introduced to Aus-
tralia by Yankees who came here from
California seeking gold.

“John Dory”: The big basker shark
(B. 10/1 /’34) is no more to be feared
than a sunfish, for all his size, for he
feeds on small surface fish which swim
in shoals, is almost toothless, and is slow-
moving. The sharks fishermen fear are
the white pointer, which, though he may
be only 12ft. long, has a girth like a
prize ox and a mouth like a carpet-bag ;
the tiger and the grey nurse. But the
most dangerous of all is the little ground
shark, a lazy-looking brute which cruises
about in the shallow water of estuaries
and bays. For all his appearance of lan-
guor he can move swiftly when he wants
to ; no amount of splashing will frighten
him away, and his cheek has to be seen
to be believed. A mate of mine was
cleaning fish on the end of a little stone
jetty when one of these brutes came into
three feet of water, attracted by the fish
entrails, and refused to budge even when
pelted with stones. I once pulled my
dinghy in close to the shore, and was
loading it with meat from a dead cow,
intended for crayfish bait, when a ground
shark came into two feet of water and
began to rip lumps off the hindquarter,
which I had let fall in order to get out
of his road. A whack from a paddle
didn’t make him shift, so I turned him
into cray bait with a charge of shot at
close range. He was only a six-footer,
but I’d hate to meet his like if I were in
for a swim.

“Irediparra”: Sydney naturalists have
been agreeably fluttered by the discovery
of lotus birds breeding within 30 miles
of the Bridge. The slender-legged fowl

Jacana family, found throughout the
tropical and sub-tropical regions of the
world. They are essentially swamp

dwellers and get their colloquial name of
“lily-trotters” from their ability to
scamper over the wide leaves of the lotus
and other water plants. This is made
possible by the enormous development of
their long and slender toes and claws,
the spre&d of which helps them to move
about on surface-growing plants without
trouble. The last lot heard of in N.S.W.
was at Mudgee nearly 50 years ago. Usu-
ally they do not come further south than
the N.S.W. Northern Rivers.

“Beady”: The Melbourne-Sydney ex-
press was rolling along at over 60 m.p.h.
after leaving Moss Vale the other morn-
ing, when a bee sailed in through my
window. He had a swig at the water-bottle,
scratched his ear with a hind leg and
hopped off again into the blue with a con-
fidence and deliberation that spoke of
long experience in tapping the water
supply carried by moving trains.

“H.A.L.”: Here’s a parallel case to the
woman who tried to kill a cherry-tree by
pouring boiling water on the roots (B.
10/l/’34). Jones bought a house with a
neglected garden, and tried to make
something of it. He couldn’t, and blamed
the roots of the trees along his neighbor’s
side of the dividing fence for his failure
to grow anything. The neighbor refused
to remove the trees, so Jones sneaked
oyer the fence one night with a brace and
bit, bored holes into the trunk of each
tree, plugged them with salt, and waited
for them to die. Instead they began
to flourish amazingly. He took his
trouble to a botanist friend at last, and
the friend laughed loud and -long, for
the trees were tamarisks and salt was
food to them.
* * * *
“Noondoo”: Mention of a demonstra-
tion of ear-cutting as a poison cure on
the Balonne River (B. 24/1/’34) recalls
a general election when two of the station
hard cases rode in to vote at Dirranbandi,
the nearest booth. Both got full to the
teeth and decided it was a fair thing for a
sleep when they came to the half-way
gate. When their horses returned without
them nobody was surprised. When the
pair arrived next morning, one with
a magnificent black eye and the other
with an ear encrusted with dried blood,
there was some curiosity. “Old George”
explained. “Y’ see, w’en I wakes up an’
sees Pat lyin’ there all gashly I shakes
’im. No answer. Then I kicks ’im. Not
er move outer ’im. I thinks ‘Be cripes,
’e’s poisoned with that there rum.’
So I lugs out me knife an’ starts t’ nick
’is ear. I ’adn’t slit it more’n ’arf an
inch w’en up ’e ’ops with er ’orrible yell
and gives me this ringabeller in the eye.
Don’t tell me ear-slittin’s no good for
poisonin’! ”
* * * *
“X-X”: “Bullionist” (B. 22/11/’33)
and others can cease their speculations
about putting a Maori head on the new
M.L. coinage. If one rule of etiquette is
held more firmly than another by the
Mint authorities, it is that when the head
of the sovereign appears on a coin there
can be no other human head thereon ;
and a silver coin for M.L. without the
royal effigy would be unthinkable. In any
case, a typical Maori head would be hard
to select. Maori physiognomy varies all the
way from pure Caucasian of the Greek
type, through Roman and Semitic, to
negroid. Two generations ago and over,
the moko gave a superficial uniformity ;
but to represent a Maori in the twentieth
century as a tattooed person would be
as much an anachronism as to depict an
Englishman in a periwig. The tattooing
fashion lasted longer with the wahine,
but at the present time it is doubtful
whether, even in the remotest parts of the
Uriwera or the King Country, a lady of
less than 45 years could be found with the
lower lip tattooed in the old style.
* * * *
“A.J.L.”: On the N. S. Wales North
Coast a dairyman who milked a good
many cows noticed that a cow heavy in
milk at the bailing-up time was prac-
tically dry when he came to milk it. He
was puzzled, but dismissed the matter
from his mind. As days went past
this cow gave her quota of milk with the
others, and then mysteriously went dry
again. The mystery was solved when
a huge brown snake was discovered in
the milking shed, so bloated that he had
great difficulty in moving.
* * * *
“Paumotu”: The Fijian cocoanut crab
is different from any of the breed I have
met if he has “a very susceptible hinder
part” (B. 24/1 / ’34), though his habit of
storing up fat under his tail-flap may have
given “T.D.T.” a wrong impression. In
other islands, the natives don’t bother
about guarding their trees with elaborate
leather belts spiked with sharp nails. They
just twist a band of grass or shredded leaf
round the palm trunk and, if there are
none there already, place a circle of
stones round the bottom. Coming back-
wards down the trunk, the crab, feeling
gingerly every step of the way with his
hind legs, heaves a sigh of relief when
he comes to the grass band and, thinking
he is on terra firma, lets fly tacks and
sheets, only to drop disastrously on the
stones below.
* * * *
“Plankton”: Champion zoological
howler of the holiday season was pro-
vided by a Southport scribe who reported
that a small whale, stranded at Queens-
land’s fashionable coast resort, suffered
from a remarkable peculiarity, its tail-fins
being horizontally instead of vertically
placed. Evidently that correspondent had
never met a whale before and didn’t know
it wasn’t a fish.
* * * *
“Ben N.”: The wasp “Kali” (B.
3/1/’34). saw is the sand wasp or
cicada-killer (Exeirus lateritus). It makes
tunnels in the ground, sometimes as
large as mouse-holes, which branch
off into galleries. In each of the
chambered galleries the female wasp
stores a cicada, and deposits one large
white egg on the under-surface of the
thorax. The larva feeds on the cicada
until it is nothing but a shell, then it
pupates in the chamber. When a wasp
catches a cicada it paralyses it by its
sting, then drags it off to its burrow.
Another sand wasp found in Eastern Aus-
tralia is Chlorion vestita, which preys on
crickets.
THE OLD BLADE SHED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas a calm, clear eve in the late November;
The hills were flushed with the sunset red,
When I reined my horse in a clump of timber
To gaze again on the old blade shed.
The bush about it had changed to meadows,
And the wheat waved high round the walls
of wood,
But the gums still whispered and threw their
shadows
Where, strong and sturdy, the old shed stood.
There’s ever something of sadness after
You’ve viewed some scene of your early
years,
The spot that rang to your childish laughter
Or saw the fall of your foolish tears.
It came to me with the well-known places,
As memory gathered each broken thread,
And I heard the voices and saw the faces
Of the men who shore in the old blade shed.
And my mind went back to the years departed,
To the warm spring days when the pens
were full,
W'hen the bell was rung and the shearers
started,
And their blades bit deep in the soft, white
wool.
Again in fancy I saw them bending
With beaded brows while their breaths came
deep,
And I heard the click of the shear-blades
blending
With the yell for “tar” and the bleat of
sheep.
I was only a lad, but I loved to linger
And watch and listen, all eyes and ears;
From the rouseabout to the bearded, ringer
1 knew them all in those far-off yeafs.
And they told me tales of the runs far distant,
Of the sprees they had and the lives they led;
And my heart beat fast as I sat and listened
So long ago in the old blade shed.
Now gone for ever the old-time glories,
The bleat of sheep and the click of shears;
Hushed and ended the wondrous stories
That rang so sweet in my boyish ears,
The tales that lured me to be a rover,
The sky my roof and the earth my bed.
But long ere the days of my youth were over
I bade good-bye to the old blade shed.
The evening shadows were falling round me
When I sighed and woke from my dream
at last,
For broken now were the bonds that bound me
To this quiet scene in the years long past.
The friends of my boyhood were gone for ever;
The dreams that gladdened my youth were
dead;
And I turned my horse with a sudden shiver,
And rode away from the old blade shed.
VICTORIA.
EDWARD HARRINGTON.

PROPOSED
MENTALITY TEST.
Questions that will do to
go on with:
1. A firm is offering £5 for
every sixer and £1 for every
boundary shot. As a true-
blue amateur, how would you
frame your communication
refusing the money?
2. You have been asked to
write your life-story and make
talkies and records. With
royalties, you should net
£4500, but if you take it the
board will refuse to pay you
your £l5O deferred pay.
Would you defy the board?
Reasons, if any, must be
stated.
3. An ultra-sensitive soul,
you are batting against a
northern county. A raucous
barracker yells: “Thou’rt a
moog baat, laad. ’Ast bin in
foorr minutes an’ ’it nowt.
Wake oop! ” Acting on pre-
cedent, would you view this
as an “international incident”
and send a hot cable to
“Yellowpress News”?
4. At an important social
function your captain is re-
sponding. He has almost
finished his speech, and you
notice with horror that he has
not once used the phrase
“Ambassadors of Empire.”
Detail steps you would take to
apprise him of this grave omission.

To evade the flour tax we might eat

A concerted refusal to die would be

The hall was stifling as the professor
began his lecture. His serge suit, high
collar and tightly-drawn tie added to his
discomfort. In the audience were a few
lightly-clad women who watched him

seen to stagger and fall. Willing hands
offered first aid. Presently the chairman
spoke: “It is with great regret that Prof.

COLONEL BEDLOVER’S PLAN.
The secretary of the Late-Risers’
League writes:
Many, as a result* of overproduction, falling
prices and the dastardly action of storekeepers
in refusing unlimited tick, are faced with em-
barrassment and worse. This disastrous state
of affairs may easily and without expense be
eliminated. Instead of starting work at day-
light, as they are always telling people they
do now, the Australians should rise, say, at
about nine, enjoy a leisurely breakfast, read
the paper for an hour or two, put in a few
minutes at work of an unproductive nature, and
go to lunch. Then, if, keeping their produc-
tive proclivities in complete subjection, they
were to continue, after a long midday siesta,
with non-essential work until it was time (say,
about 5 p.m.) to have an early tea, they would,
without the annoyance of being fatigued, which
so often compels them to go to bed early, be
able to enjoy the feast of advertisements, jazz
and crooning provided so thoughtfully for
them until about midnight by the various
broadcasting stations. Overproduction would
then automatically subside and the equi-
librium of the State be speedily regained.

IMPROVEMENTS.
“The R.A.S. of Victoria considered a motion
that steer-riding should be eliminated from
future steer-riding competitions.”
Certain cricketers anticipated the
vogue, and the expression “It’s not
cricket” has frequently been heard at
cricket of late. We find a like phenome-
non at bargain sales where all the bar-
gains have been eliminated. Similarly,
there is no news in many newspapers.
It all goes to show that the psychologist
who first suggested dispelling the depres-
sion from the depression was right.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Rose Mignon, a candidate for the Oak-
leigh Plate and Newmarket Handicap,
directed attention to her prospects in
those events by scoring a 10-length win
in the first division of the Encourage
Handicap at Ascot (Vic.) on Saturday.
This four-year-old mare is trained by W.
Burke, who prepared Quintus for a New-
market Handicap victory in 1924. People
who are guided by coincidences in their
turf speculations may be impressed by
the further fact that T. M. Burke, in
whose colors Quintus raced, bred Rose
Mignon; he imported the dam, Oboe,
from England in 1927 and mated her
with Heroic. The first progeny was
Harding, and in the following season
came Rose Mignon (also by Heroic).
Though it was only her third appear-
ance in public Rose Mignon had executed
a swallow-catching trial at Flemington,
and this caused her to be backed down
to 6 to 4 on. She is jointly owned by
D. D. D. Mackinnon, the bloodstock
salesman, and W. J. Bayles, brother of
Norman Bayles.
Members of the V.R.C. committee are
more than ever shedding the light of
their countenances on Ascot meetings
since G. J. C. Dyett, secretary of the
V.T. and R.A., was knighted. H. Alan
Currie and Guy Raymond have been
fairly frequent attendants for months

past. On Saturday Philip Russell and
J. A. MacLeod patronised the official en-
closure. At this rate Ascot may aspire to
entertain royalty when the centenary
celebrations arrive. The secretary again
had occasion to lament bad weather at
the week-end—the fourth consecutive
Ascot fixture that had been marred by
rain. However, the attendance was good
and fields kept up well. It must be gall-
ing to the battling owners, on whom the
club originally depended for nominations,
to find that pony-racing is almost passing
out of existence in Melbourne. Only
one of the eight events on Saturday was
confined to the undersized gallopers,
whereas half the programme used to be
reserved for ponies.
Dyett and his committee are not stingy
with stake-money, and in that respect set
an example to Epsom and Mentone,
where minimum requirements of the
V.R.C. are seldom exceeded. The Ascot
Five Hundred brought out 17 runners
and induced spirited betting. Originally
quoted at 8 to 1, Kaoota was the medium
of a heavy stable plunge and firmed to
2 to 1 at barrier-rise. He belongs to a
son-in-law of T. J. Confoy, proprietor of
the Napier Park dog-racing grounds,
who does not lack courage as a punter.
Kaoota jumped out in advance of all
his rivals, but dropped back after travel-
ling a couple of furlongs and did not
threaten danger for the remainder of the
journey. He was ridden by Jim Pike’s
nephew, Lightfoot, who had to be substi-
tuted for W. Cook. Latter jockey had had
a thrilling experience in the first division
of the Trial Handicap. His mount, Miss
Johnnie, stumbled and fell, Cook being
bounced along the turf like a football
in the midst of a packed field. He mira-
culously escaped with a cut on the nose
and a few bruises, but V.R.C. regula-
tions provide that any jockey who sus-
tains a fall shall not be allowed to ride
again during the afternoon.
The Five Hundred was brilliantly cap-
tured by La Scala, the three-year-old filly
by Manfred from Frances Tressady. La
Scala had a bad spin in the first half of
the journey and was carried out rather
wide at the home turn; yet she managed
to gain control near the judge’s box and
stalled off a challenge from the diminu-
tive Watchful by a head. Plum King,
who obtained a lucky run on the rails,
was a head farther away third. A.
Brown, the rider of Watchful, protested
on the ground of interference shortly
after the start; but this rather unusual
objection was dismissed. La Scala is in
both the Oakleigh Plate and Newmarket
Handicap. She has advanced in calibre
by leaps and bounds in the past few
weeks, as might be expected of a filly
whose sire and dam each annexed the
Victoria Derby.
Harry Telford visited Ascot for the
first time on Saturday, and saddled-up
Coon Band for the Five Hundred and
Roseboy for the Juvenile Handicap.
Former went out at 100 to 1 and shaped
accordingly, but Roseboy was well sup-
ported and finished third to Plankton
and Sun Charm. He might have won
with better luck in running. Rosebqy is
by Constant Son and may be written
down as sure to succeed in the near
future. Plankton was bred by Mrs. S. O.
Wood, daughter of A. T. Creswick, and
is by Chivalrous from Nekton, by Sea
Prince from a half-sister to Solution,
winner of the A.J.C. Metropolitan of
1906.
H= * H* *
Though Saturday was a perfect day,
Sydney racegoers had nowhere to go, the
Rosehill people having postponed their
meeting from Saturday until to-morrow
when it was raining heavens hard on Fri-
day. This club has been unfortunate as
regards the weather. Last year two fix-
tures were postponed, and it lost heavily
on both.
Holder of the Australasian record for
seven furlongs, Turbine, with Bst. 71b.,
may be the best of the local brigade in
the Doncaster. He has developed into a
nice horse, and is the real type to win
the big mile. With the same weight,
Blixten’s connections may be tempted to
run him, but it is difficult to see him
conceding weight and age to Dame Moab,
who is nicely handicapped at 7st. 131 b.
So is Air Queen at 7st. 81b.
Peter Pan is a great horse, but with
9st. 101 b. he has plenty to carry in the
Sydney Cup. He has 9st. 51b. in the
King’s Cup, and may be reserved for that
race. Hall Mark, Bst. 121 b., and Topical,
Bst. 111 b., are genuine stayers, and they
will be among the early picks for the
Sydney Cup, as will Oro. Latter’s stable-
mate, Clever Fox, was the hero of the
recent A.J.C. summer meetings, but with
Bst. 51b. he will be meeting stronger oppo-
sition.
Nord (7st. 71b.), Mince Pie (7st. 41b.)
and Balgay (7st. 21b.) are lightweights
with credentials. Eric Connolly’s Night
Raid colt Wheriko has been awarded
Bst. lib. He created a favorable impres-
sion when he won the Warriston Welter
at Caulfield in September; the runners
included Brutus, who had a victory over
Hall Mark. Dame Moab and Wheriko
is a double that appeals.
Chatham failed to win the Newmarket
last year with lOst. 21b. This year he
is asked to carry two pounds more (he
has the same weight in the Doncaster),
and his connections may take him south.
Jacko, with Bst. 121 b., will be one of the
early picks. Little Carefree is not out of
it with 7st. 111 b., and L’Elite with Bst.
lib. is brilliant; so is La Scala (7st. 71b.).
Last year’s winner, Waltzing Lily, has
gone from Bst. 91b. to 9st. 71b.
Peter Jackson (Bst. 91b.) is one of the
genuine stayers in the Australian Cup,
and he should go close to scoring.
Limarch will also be suited by the
journey, but he has Bst. 51b. Heroic
Prince (Bst. 51b.), Eastern Chief (Bst 21b.)
and Sea Rover (7st. 51b.) have been show-
ing good staying form. La Scala and
Peter Jackson looks a fair double.
* * * *
The St. Legers are going to be inter-
esting. Spring form pointed to Hall
Mark having a mortgage on both ; but
the successes of Clever Fox up to a mile
and a half, the track work of Limarch
and the reported good progress of the
Victorians Break Up and Palphar and
of the Queensland Derby winner Waikare
and his stable-mate Blixten suggest strong
opposition for the chestnut. Of course,
one or two may be reserved for the Don-
caster, but there should be enough re-
maining to keep Kellow’s colt moving.
* * * *
It’s becoming fashionable for broken-
winded horses to win. The latest to join
the ranks of the victorious roarers or
whistlers is Balesy, who spreadeagled a
field at Ascot (Sydney). His owner, S.
Creamer, a hotelkeeper at Manly, was
present to 1 see him' score. Palphar, who
won the Caulfield Guineas, and was
second to Hall Mark in the Vic. Derby,
makes a slight noise when at his top.
It may not trouble him ; it has not inter-
fered with Chatham. Moreover Denis
Boy was very “musical.”
* * * *
There will be no more farcical long-
distance weight-for-age races at Rand-
wick ; the A.J.C. committee is fixing time
limits as in the old days of the Rand-
wick Plate. If the revived experiment
doesn’t answer, the committee might try
buying a club horse for these events.
Owners of cracks would appreciate this
particular innovation, which would also

“Morobe”: The first Morobe Cup, re-
cently decided at Wau, on the New
Guinea goldfields, was won by a horse
owned by Rossiter, one of the old hands.
A few days before the meeting, feed ran
out, so the horse was fed on “boy bis-
cuits.” When Rossiter’s jockey arrived
from the south and went over to have a
look at the horse, he asked “What sort of
stuff is he eating?” When told, he asked
why they did not have sufficient sense to
wet the provender first, adding “Do you
think I came all this way to ride a tin of
biscuits?”

Night Guard, a brother to Phar Lap,
has been sold at Wellington (M.L.) for
15 guineas. At the same sale Zetes, who
cost 2400 guineas as a yearling, changed
hands at 50 guineas. Night Guard is a
five-year-old, and was raced by Louisson,
who won the 1929 Melbourne Cup with
Nightmarch.
M. (and Rafferty) Rules
The crowds are following Lurich to
Newtown, where the Russian and Joe
Dawson, an Aussie, furnished fireworks
on Saturday. Dawson was faster than
his opponent, and gained a fall with a
reverse slam in the fourth. Lurich made
it level pegging with standing overarm
headlocks and a body-press in the last
round, and the match was declared a
draw. At Leichhardt, Meeske beat
“Whiskers” Blake by two falls to one.
In the fifth and last round he floored his
man, stood on Blake’s beard and twisted
his wrist until he submitted.
Ins and Outs
Victoria ended its first innings against
N. in Sydney, 265 runs behind, and
followed on. Steady plugging against
unadventurous bowling saw the visitors
with only five gone for 274 when stumps
were drawn on the final day. Darling
made an attractive 93, while little Scaife
again batted in taking style for 80. Ma
won on the first innings by 265 runs.
This did not give her points enough to
retain the Sheffield Shield, which goes
back to the Cabbage Garden after three
years’ absence.

The Board of Control meeting in Syd-
ney accepted the South African invita-
tion to tour the Union in 1935-36. The
programme has to be approved by the
Imperial Conference in England. It
begins with a match against Natal at
Durban. There are 15 matches in all,
including five Tests. The tour ends with
the last of these, which begins at Cape-
town on February 12, 1936.

Racquet and Bawl
At the end of the second day of the
fourth tennis X est at Adelaide Australia
had the comfortable lead of five rubbers,
13 sets to three rubbers, 10 sets.
In Friday’s singles, Wilde beat Turnbull,
but Hopman and Quist won from Hughes
and Lee. Hughes and Perry took the
doubles from Crawford and Hopman in
a hard-fought five-set go, the first set run-
ning to 30 games. On Saturday Hopman
and Turnbull downed Wilde and Hughes,
but Perry had another easy win over
Crawford. Quist and Turnbull took the
doubles from Lee and Wilde by three sets
to two after another tough battle.

In the bottom half of the European
draw for the Davis Cup, Australia has
nicked a bye for the first round, but will
then have to tackle a stiffish proposition
in Japan. The latter may be minus Satoh
and Nunoi, but Nippon has a knack of
producing good unknowns.

In japan, the Australian Universities
team struck unexnected disaster. Win-
ning from Kansai at Osaka they were
later trounced by Keio University (16-8)

team is not up to inter-State class, but
to win like this the Japanese must have
improved out of sight since we saw them
in Sydney some years ago.

The N.S.W. championship eights and
sculls rowed on the Nepean on Saturday
saw Sydney retain the title by five lengths
from Mosman in 15min. 14sec. for the
three miles. The win was the more meri-
torious since Sydney’s stroke, Lambert,
dropped out through illness and was re-
placed by J. A. Goulding, the sculler.
He set his crew a high rate throughout
and they responded splendidly. Uni. was
third, while Police and Haberfield also
ran. Police had a crumb of comfort
when H. J. Turner, the Australian cham-
pion, who now wears the blue, won the
sculls by 20 lengths in 17min. 39 4-ssec.

Ins and Outs
The selection of the Australian Eleven
for England has produced the usual
atmosphere of stupefaction and congratu-
lation, according to the direction pub-
lic prejudice and sympathy have taken.
Woodfull is skipper, with Bradman
second in command. The other 14 are:
Barnett, Bromley, Brown, Darling, Kip-
pax, McCabe, Ponsford, Ebeling, Grim-
mett, Oldfield, O’Reilly, Wall, Fleetwood
Smith and Chipperfield. The batting
and wicket-keeping are fairly strong;
the bowling outside O’Reilly and Wall
is weak. Fleetwood Smith has shown
himself unable to deal with an
attacking batsman, before whom he
seems hypnotised. The fearful pastings
he got from Hammond last season and
from Bradman in the Victoria-N.S.W.
match are eloquent of the fact. He is
a googly bowler also, like Grimmett, and
two of that brand are out of place in one
team. Chipperfield, a slow leg-break
bowler, and on his day a useful bat, is
open to the same objection. He is a slip-
field worthy of the best Australian tradi-
tions, but, unless his bowling or batting
lifts him into the Tests, this accomplish-
ment will be wasted. The Englishmen
must be pleased at the omission of Oxen-
ham ; “he gave our batsmen more trouble
than Grimmett did last year,” says Tate.
* * * *
For the “consolation” team for Maori-
land thirteen have been picked. Richard-
son, chosen as skipper, is a doubtful
starter, and so is Fingleton. The others
are Rigg, Andrews, Badcock, Chilvers,
Davey, Hill, Lonergan, McCormick,
Nagel, Nitschke and Walker. The tour-
ists play eleven matches, starting at Mas-
terton on Feb. 20 and ending at Palmer-
ston North on March 27. Only one Test
will be played, beginning March 2 at
Dunedin.
* * * *
“Tenth Slip”: Of course, the Board of
Control couldn’t miss the chance afforded
by the Sydney meeting of again making a
cuckoo of itself. It has instructed
manager Bushby and treasurer Bull, its
delegates to the Imperial Cricket Confer-
ence in London, to press the general
adoption of the idiotic rule regarding
bodyline bowling which the junta had
the nerve to insert in the laws of cricket
as 48b. The impossible thing will, of
course, be thrown out on its neck, but
the happening will revive the bodyline
grouch, which everyone but a few mal-
contents on the board desires to see spif-
licated for ever.
* * * *
“Dingbat”: Rumors were flying about
that the new agreement the Board of
Control is asking its cricketers to sign
was a bobbv-dazzler, having the laws of
the Medes *,id the Persians beaten down
the course, Really, it is much the same
as last time —no wives and no writing for
the press. The addition of broadcasting
to the other things banned is about the
only innovation. As it has been reported
that one of the selected players is an in-
veterate “crooner” the board must for
once receive the warmest congratulation
of the Australian public.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: When the early Aus-
tralian Elevens which made this country’s
reputation on cricket fields overseas set
out on their Odysseys they never bothered
about taking along masseurs, field ambu-
lances and a set of V.A.Ds., though the
teams rarely numbered more than a
baker’s dozen and a programme of 40
matches or so was a commonplace. If
any shin wanted a plaster or a bruise
rubbing, they did it themselves with a
mate to help. Your is in another
category. He must have skilled masseurs
in his dressing-rooms and other help of
the kind at beck and call. Some of the
luckless lads conscripted to go to Eng-
land this year at £6OO the trip and all ex-
penses paid are already demanding a
masseur to travel with them. The board
does not fall in with the idea, but the
problem is easily solved. Let the players
so much in need of him each subscribe
a modicum of that £6OO themselves for
the services of a strapper-down and the
thing is done.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: The testimonial to Ernest
(“Jonah”) Jones, Australia’s fast bowler
for some ten years at the end of the cen-
tury, results in a sum of £IOOO for the
veteran. S.A. Cricket Association gave
part of the N.S.W. match gate.
* * * s|s
“Philm”: When the Westralian XI un-
packs its gear on the other side of the
continent, some bright batting should be
seen from Ryan and F. Bryant, who were
contemporaries at school with Bromley
and Lonergan in the year when the
C.B.C. XI piled up scores that looked
like an Australian State’s depression defi-
cit. Bryant has one century to his name
in first-class cricket, but Ryan will face
up to class bowling for the first time.
* * * *
“Callan Park”: Though, naturally,
one deprecates that “didn’-I-tell-ya?”
spirit, I cannot refrain from pointing out
that, of all the experts attempting to select
the Australian XI before Dolling, Dwyer
and Woodfull took a hand, only one
picked Chipperfield (B. 24/1/’34).
Myself, to wit.
Racquet and Baw!
“Rev. Knucklebone”: The Davis Cup
selection committee has chosen the team
that did so well last year—Crawford,
McGrath, Quist and Turnbull. Many
would have liked to see Hopman
in Turnbull’s place, since he is the
stronger singles player and has an inter-
national reputation as a doubles man.
Still, Hopman has shown in recent
matches that he is not the player of a
couple of years ago. The selectors have
picked him as emergency, and it may
yet happen that a fifth man will go—
especially as it has been openly an-
nounced that Crawford will in future
play in singles only.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Westralia has some
cause to squeal over the selection of
a team of second-stringers to represent
Australia at Perth in the last tennis Test
against England (B. 31 /1 / ’34), but there
are other matters than a Westralian profit
to consider. Our Davis Cup men have all
been playing continually since they re-
turned to Australia, and they have to
leave again for England in the middle of
March. Crawford has definitely cracked
up under the strain, and McGrath has
also been put on the peg for a spell.
If the full team had gone to Perth it
could not have been back from the West
before the end of this month, which
would have given it barely a fort-
night’s spell before sailing.
* * & *
“Wowser”: The N.S.W. tennis authori-
ties’ objection to shorts being worn by
players is certain to have been swept
away by next season like the rain on
the river. In minor tennis shorts are almost
universal, and both America and Eng-
land, countries where the Puritan
flourishes like the green bay tree, have
succumbed to what was not long ago
considered a device of the Old Gentleman.
Stan Doust, to the writer’s knowledge a
most circumspect person, has just been
penning eulogies of them as worn by a
team of American flapper squc sh-racket
players. “Neat and not shocking” is the
Australian tennis writer’s verdict, and he
seems to have given close attention to
the subject.
“Cut Shot”: It is good news to hear that
Joan Hartigan is likely to go to Europe
for the coming season there. Last year
the N.S.W. tennis heads asked their Aus-
tralian opposite numbers to send her over,
and the request is to be repeated. Failing
consent by the A.L.T.A., Ma might this
time dig down into her own stocking and
fork out the expenses of the lass. Mrs.
Molesworth, several times Australian
champion and one of the holders of the
doubles, a player little, if anything, in-
ferior to Joan, is going at her own cost.
Here is a grand chance for the two to
join up, and a mighty formidable doubles
combination they would make, apart
from their prowess in singles.
* * * *
“Barnum”: Tilden and Vines continue
to battle, like the Lion and the Unicorn
in the “Looking Glass,” all round the
principal towns of the United States, and,
as befits good showmanship, victory does
not lean too much to one side or the
other. At late advices, Vines had won 6
of the 11 matches on the tour. The last
match was a record, running to 79 games
for the five sets, Tilden taking the second
at 23-21. It lasted four hours and both
men were gasping at the finish.
* * , * ' *
“Spiggotty”: Two notable additions to
professional tennis are Rico and Filo
Facondie, Chilean brothers, who recently
disorganised professional tennis betting
by defeating Nusslein and Kozeluh. The
Chileans have opened a fund to send
them to Europe to clean up the profes-
sionals there, and, that done, they will
invade Tilden’s fastnesses. The two are
illiterate, and first made acquaintance
with tennis as ball-boys. They have a
good deal of Araucanian Indian blood
in their veins, and this is supposed to
give them the tremendous strength and
stamina coupled with speed which has
been too much for the opposition en-
countered to date.
* * * *
“Iconoclast”: Though the matter has
received little attention in Australia, the
question of whether one service shall be
substituted for two in tennis is being
fiercely debated abroad. As matters
stand now, the possessor of a devastating
service has a long start in the game over
a player less accomplished in this parti-
cular branch of play. The theory is
that if only one service be allowed the
player would not risk everything for
speed on his only shot. Half the experts
are in favor of change and half against
it, of course. Here is my solution, bor-
rowed from Australian Rules football.
Have the umpire stand in the middle of
the court at the net with the players of
each side beside him and bounce the ball.
After that it would be devil take the
hindmost.
* * * *
“Kooyong”: The Australian L.T.A.
is acting on the suggestion to invite a
number of overseas players to visit Aus-
tralia for the Melbourne centenary, when
a special tourney will be' arranged for
them. Invitations are going out to Eng-
land, France, South Africa, Japan and
America (two each), with Maier, of Spain,
and Cramm, of Germany, specially invited
on their own. Last year the South Afri-
cans entertained a mixed bag: Maier,
Rogers, Gentien and Tinkler.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: With the Davis Cup
looming, a reminder as to dates may be
fitting. The first round must be over by
May 30, the second by June 12, the third
by June 21, and the European zone final
by July 16. July 19-20-21 are the dates
allotted the inter-zone final, in which we
hope to see Australia meet America. The
challenge round with England starts at
Wimbledon on July 26. Roper Barrett,
the ex-international and non-playing
skipper of the Britons, is chairman of a
committee of three members of the Eng-
lish L.T.A. which controls this year’s con-
tests.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Admiral Blowmetight”: Fortunately
my dear old friend Colonel Damurize is
not permitted to read golfing news in the
hospital where he is spending the
twilight of his days. Otherwise I would
fear for the consequences had he read
some recent commentary on the growth
of associate golf which has appeared in
the Sydney press. In June, 1914, when
the women’s State championship weighed
anchor at Kensington, there were 14
entrants. On the same afternoon and
on the same course, the country cham-
pionship was contested ; for this there
were 10 entrants. Last year the State
championship attracted close on 100 de-
termined females to the fray, and there
would have been 10 times as many had
qualification for entry not been limited
to a 12 handicap or less. It took a long

“Brassey”: A Manly (N.S.W.) golf
club official made rather a quaint break
the other day when he ordered a player
off the tee with instructions to go and
dress himself properly. The offender —
who was Jim Ferrier, by the way—was
costumed in the customary golfing gar-
ments from neck to knee, but was wear-
ing socks instead of stockings, thus ex-
posing a small expanse of bare shin.
Considering that golfers of both sexes
on nearly every course in the Empire
and in Europe and America habitually
affect shorts and bare legs, this outbreak
of Puritanism at Manly comes as a
shock —especially as Manly’s streets are
thronged from daylight to dark with
exuberantly figured young females in
scanty swimming costumes.
jK H* He H*
“Divot Digger”: Now that the N.S.W.
Golf Council is preparing to send a
team to Maoriland to play the Windeyer
Cup fixture postponed last year, it is cer-
tain that Jim Ferrier will be one of the
team. One curious aspect of the pre-
liminaries to the trip is the decision of the
council to keep conditions as to expenses,
etc., private, details only being supplied
to those who have entered their names
as willing to make the trip at Easter.
This can only be due to the recent inti-
mation by St. Andrews to the M.L. golf
authorities that the sending of Misses
Oliver Kay and Gaisford to England by
means of a fund subscribed by M.L.
golfers would constitute a breach of
amateurism. There are ndt many Aus-
tralian golfers of class who can make
these long and expensive trips without a
helping hand from somewhere.
“Hamilton”: The Queensland golfing
world is being rent asunder over the
adoption of the par-handicapping system,
which has been recommended by the han-
dicappers to the State Golf Council. Par
handicapping is now universal in America
and has been adopted in N.S.W. It is
determined by the length of the holes,
and the only objection comes from those
sensitive players who realise that its adop-
tion will mean the lengthening of their
handicaps. Standard scratch score, used
as a basis for handicapping in Britain
and in Queensland, as well as some of
the other States, is notoriously inade-
quate as a guide to genuine form, players
handicapped on one course often hav-
ing an advantage when playing on an-
other. Alteration of the courses must
follow the adoption of the par system,
and this has caused heartburning. How-
ever, the G.C. has announced that it will
not rush the new system, and the diehards
have had to be content with that.
* * * *
» “Woogaroo”: The annual tourney for
the Queensland A.N.A. Cup was played
this year on Royal Queensland’s course
at the Hamilton and was won by H. C. H.
Robertson from one of the largest fields
in the history of the event. The winner,
playing off 10, returned a net card of 70 ;
his home run of 37 was particularly
meritorious, beating bogey by one on the
nine holes. The best gross score was G.
Thomson’s 74, made up of two 37’s. He
missed a short putt on the last green for
a tie with the winner. His handicap was
three, so his net card read 71.
* * * *
“Sandy Gallop”: Goodna golf club in
Queensland has acquired a new profes-
sional to succeed C. Brown, gone to
fresh “woods” and fairways new. He is
A. S. McArthur, who has been profes-
sional to the Bundaberg club. A Scot,
of course, he came to Australia some
years ago, and after professional work
with various N.S.W. clubs went on to
Queensland, where he has achieved a re-
putation as a sound golfer with a first-
class knowledge of the game. He was
prominent in the recent State professional
championship, when he led the metropoli-
tan experts in the qualifying rounds at
Royal Queensland with scores of 73
and 74.
* * * *
“Mid Mashie”: Sydney professional
golf promises to be strengthened by the
coming of Lou Kelly, the Goulburn lad
who won the national open championship
from all the crackajacks. Kelly, who will
link up with the Alan Kippax sports-
gear business, has wisely realised that
he will never develop into a great player
if he remains in the golfing backblocks,
for the. reason that his chances of meet-
ing men as good as or better than himself
are few and far between. Nothing lowers
the standard of a player so much as
constantly meeting men inferior to him-
self —be it cricket, football, tennis, or
even running, the result is a downhill
slide.
* * * *
“Lakeside”: Australia’s Joe Kirkwood,
having put the frivolities of trick golf
behind him and settled to the serious stuff,
is at last showing in the States the form
we expected from him when he went over
years ago. So much so that he finished
second in the national averages, only a
fraction of a point behind Gary Cooper.
No player could average four for the
season, though 10 had fewer than 73.
Kirkwood had 72.23 for 46 rounds,
Cooper playing 62 rounds. Among the
amateurs, open champion Goodman was
3 under fours for 17 rounds.
“What was the umpire’s decision, Jacky?”
“Th’ cow say ‘Hop it; you’re a black out.’”
“Saltimbanque”: Borotra, the bound-
ing Basque, will bound no more on the
tennis court. Indeed he will probably
have to give up the habit altogether, for
one cannot imagine him bounding at golf,
in which he is now deeply interested. In
taking up the game he has followed the
example of his brother-in-arms Lacoste,
who is now a scratch player in France.
Another tennis champion who later made
a name on the links was H. L. Doherty.
* * * *
“Westward Ho”: The death by light-
ning in South Africa the other day of a
golfer while playing a round has caused
the golf authorities in England to draw
attention to the fact that club committees
have always power to order the abandon-
ment of play in such circumstances.
There is a movement in favor of making
it an automatic rule, for there have been
many casualties of the sort on English
courses. An upright figure in an other-
wise open and unoccupied space seems to
have a special attraction for lightning, and
in these days of steel-shafted clubs the
caddies have also to be considered.
Car and Cycle
“Bumpkin”: Phillip Island (Vic) as
a motor-racing centre has its limitations.
The Light Car Club’s 100 miles at the New
Year was not as important an occasion
as the Grand Prix, but there were long
queues of cars at both ends of the island.
At San Remo there is one ferry which
takes six vehicles at a time, 20 minutes
or so in transit, so the job of carrying
cars over and returning them is an all-
day and -night occupation. At the last
Grand Prix some car owners waited till
daylight. To throw a cantilever across
is out of the question, and so would a
bridge of boats be, for the tide runs at 15
m.p.h. and twists and curls like a ser-
pent. Farmers on the island are divided
on the advantages of the periodical inva-
sion. The conservatives don’t like it.
* * * *
“Formula”: Cabled accounts of the
finish of the Monte Carlo Rally are
characteristically scanty. It is briefly an-
nounced that British light cars achieved
“an overwhelming success.” One Healy,
driving a 10-h.p. Triumph, won the
Riviera Cup for cars in this class and
also took the International Challenge
Cup, the first time in its 13 years of
existence that it has been won outright.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The Australian motor-
cycle Grand Prix meeting on Phillip
Island (Vic.) was run in typical Vic-
torian hot weather. Victorian and N.S.W.
riders divided the honors. For Ma, D.
Bain won the junior on a 348 c.c. Velo-
cette, averaging 73.2 m.p.h. The light-
weight went to L. F. Pratt, of Victoria,
on a 248 c.c. Sunbeam, his average being
59.7 m.p.h. Pratt also won the side-car
G.P. over 50 miles, his third successive
victory, with an average mileage of 64.
The big event of the day, the senior G.P.,
went to A. Senior, of N.S.W. Riding an
A.J.S. he hopped over the 100 miles in
lhr. 20min. 55sec., a record for the race.
* * * *
“Roller”: N.S.W. cycling enthusiasts
got a shock when Olympic champion
Duncan Gray was beaten in the N.S.W.
1000 metres championship at Goulburn
by the local rider Jack Clark. The race
was practically a trial for the selection
of a candidate for the Empire Games,
and Gray was fancied. On a wet track,
Clark was timed at lmin. 14 l-ssec., only
a second and a fifth outside Gray’s Olym-
pic record for the same distance. Gray,
who filled third place behind R. Porter,
of Enfield, had won the threequarter-mile
championship in lmin. 39sec. a little
while before the 1000 metres, and that
may have taken the edge off him.
* * * *
“Sprocket”: The management of the
Empire Games in England recently re-
arranged the programme, transferring the
cycling events to Manchester for August
11. This will clash with the world’s
amateur sprint cycling championships, to
be held at Leipzig on the same day. The
leading British sprinters will thus have
to give the chance of a world’s cham-
pionship a miss or dodge the Empire
events. The Dominion riders will be
worse off than their British cobbers, for
they are definitely committed to the Em-
pire Games, though most of them would
have been glad to try their luck in the
big event in Germany.
Miscellaneous
“Glenelg”: The Australian athletic
championships in Adelaide ended with
Victoria retaining the Coombes Shield by
two points, with Ma in second place.
N.S.W. was confident of the sprint races,
but Hampson was downed in each —by
Queenslander Dempsey, who ran the 100
in 10 dead after winning his heat in
9 4-ssec., and in the 220 by Yates, of Vic-
toria, who was timed at 22 dead. At the
end of the first day N.S.W. led with five
points to Victoria’s three, haying taken
the quarter, broad and high jumps, the
shot putt and the javelin throw. On Mon-
day Victoria broke away and made up the
lost ground and a bit over. Ma made a
fight for it, and each finished with nine
firsts. Victoria had seven seconds to
five by N.S.W., so that was that. Queens-
land was third, and South Australia,
Tassie and Westralia followed in that
order.,

Australian athletics will be the poorer
for the retirement from the presidency
of the A.A.A. Union of “Dick” Coombes
after 37 years of devoted service. Ill-
health, coupled with advancing years, was
the reason for the resignation. A fine
athlete in his early days —walking was his
specialty, though rowing, rifle-shooting
and coursing all occupied a warm corner
of his affections —Coombes has been pro-
minently connected with amateur sport
in this country for over 50 years. He has
been succeeded by A. G. Fenner, of
South Australia, who defeated E. S.
Marks, of N.S.W., president of the
Empire Games Association, and for some
time hon. sec. of the A.A.A. Union.

“Old Q.”: The Rugby Union game in
Australia lost a keen backer when W. J.
(“Billy”) Howe heard the final whistle
blow at 60 in Sydney last week. A fine
Rugby forward in his time, he wore the
N.S.W. jersey against the All Blacks and
Queensland in 1897, and later followed
up the game as a referee. He also spent
a period in California as a Rugby coach
at Leland Stanford University, and his
stories of that experience never lost any-

thing in the telling. Of late years, bowls,
the management of a picture co. and
civic politics engaged his attention. He
was Mayor of Waverley at the time of his
death.

“A.C.”: Spencer Gollan, whose death
in London at 73 is reported, had a
wonderful all-round record as an athlete.
Born in M.L., he went to Cambridge in
due course and there excelled in run-
ning, rowing, swimming, boxing, shoot-
ing, billiards and golf, though, curiously
enough, his national game of Rugby foot-
ball never seems to have interested him.
After his university days he was a keen
racing man (Moifaa won the 1904 Liver-
pool Grand National in his colors) and
a supporter of professional sculling for
a time, Tom Sullivan, of M.L., being a
protege. Golf was Gollan’s strongest
suit, and he twice won the M.L. amateur
championship—in 1902 and 1906.

“18 Metre”: This season’s race for the
Forster Cup on Sydney Harbor by the
21ft. restricted yachts was won by the
Tasmanian flyer Tassie Too, with 24
points, the Queenslander Amity being
second with 12. Tasmania has won seven
of the 13 races sailed for the Cup, and
been supreme in every State. The Tas-
manians have to thank the Batt family,
especially “W.P.,” who won first for Tas-
mania in Tassie in 1925, and has done
likewise in her successors, Tassie Too
and Tassie 111.

“Shadufi”: Australians who thought
they knew the meek Gyppo will have to
revise their impressions on reading the
report of a recent native football match
at Alex. When time went, the score was
one goal two hospital cases to one goal
three hospital cases. This was later added
to by a score of nine broken windows by
the team scoring only two h.cs. This lot
went round to the residence of the referee
and scored the windows there. In the first
half 39 free kicks for fouls were given,
the casualties being a broken ankle and
collarbone and a dislocated knee. The
story of the second spell was very simi-
lar. Strangely enough the game was not
played under Rugby League or Austra-
lian Rules, but was just plain Soccer.
* * * *
“Splash”: Several new records went up
in the Queensland section of the Aus-
tralian swimming championships, the
women putting up the best performances.
P. Oliver won the 100-yards junior men’s
swim for Westralia in 60 l-ssec., while
the 220 went to the Hawaiian Kalili in
2min. 20 3-ssec., 11 4-ssec. better than
the standing State record. M. Witt, of
Queensland, took the 440 championship
in smin. 25 l-ssec. Joyce Cooper waltzed
off with the women’s 220 yards in 2min.
42sec., and later the 100 backstroke in
lmin. 13 3-ssec., this beating the State
record by 6sec. The English girl was
beaten in the 100 sprint by Victorian
Frances Bult in 64 4-ssec.
* * * *
“Centre Half”: The Australian hockey
heads have decided to invite a team of
Indian players to visit Australia next year,
and ratification by the affiliated State
bodies is awaited. The team will be
drawn from the Bengal H. A., the larg-
est provincial body in India, and will in-
clude members of the organisation that
won the Olympic championship at
Amsterdam in 1928 and held the title at
Los Angeles in 1932. The visitors will
leave Calcutta at the end of April, and
after playing their way from Perth
through the States will go on to M.L.,
returning to the Coral Strand in Sep-
tember.

“Bumpkin”: American candidature for
Victoria’s centenary air race prize
will force up the standard to a point
where British pilots will be extended to
their utmost. One of the entrants, J. R.
Wedell, pushed a ’plane of his own design
through the ether at 305 m.p.h. He talks
confidently of doing the hop to Melbourne
in two days solo. Another, Captain Haiz-
lip, holds the U.S.A. transcontinental
speed record, and his wife holds the
women’s for land speed machines. Some
of the Yank racing machines have accom-
modation for a dozen passengers, and the
space could be used for extra fuel sup-
plies.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
CLIP INSPECTION.
“Albarmount”: As further evidence of
the need for clip criticism from the wool
stores, let me instance a neighbor’s case.
He possesses more than ordinary know-
ledge of sheep, and he has, by rigid cull-
ing each year, developed a uniform flock
carrying deep-stapled, bright-colored, fine,
highly attractive fleeces—a type suitable
to the district, as “Murrawong” (B.
10 /1 / ’34) advises. Yet his top lines
brought 3d. less than other local clips,
obviously inferior, some of which were
shorn in his own shed. I suggest his
wool may be low-yielding; but that
doesn’t supply the reason, as his return
per head is too low.
He is now in a quandary, for his wool
has failed in price for three successive
years. He has discarded his rams, and the
agent may follow. He may do some rash
act, such as the infusion of unsuitable
rams, that will take years of careful
breeding to rectify.
A little sound advice from someone
conversant with the trade might ease his
mind, save his pocket and enhance his
future. For example, the advice that his
wool is admirably suited to the French
mills, and with prospects of improved
conditions in that country next year
he could look forward to a return
of former prices ; or perhaps that, while
his clip was too well classed for re-
packers, he left in a few snow-white,
greasy fleeces which had a deterring
effect when the buyers were determining
the yield.
It only requires the whole of one
generation of sheep-cockies to know how
to prepare their wool and it will be
handed down in the father-and-son
manner, so that we may expect 90 per
cent, of future clips to be reasonably
well classed. The all-in method only
makes a harvest for repackers; whilst
the inter-lotting and pooling system is a
backward step, leaving the growers de-
pendent on another organisation.
The highest price clip in the Mudgee
(N.S.W.) district this season (H. Price’s
was prepared by one of the
owner’s sons who has attended local
wool-classing lectures arranged by the
Technological College.
Despite “Murrawong’s” denial, I con-
tend it would be added inducement to the
small growers to join such organisations
if the Graziers’ Association or kindred
bodies took up the matter of clip inspec-
tion and criticism.
WOOL AND FATS.
“Golightly”: Good merino wool aver-
ages up to about Is. Bd. per pound, and
32-341 b. fat lambs about 3d. per pound,
plus skin value, so, taking into considera-
tion that more wool-sheep may be carried
per acre than fat-lambs, farmers will not
need advice to follow the wool price.
However, the inevitable rush to pro-
duce wool-growers will work out in favor
of those fat-lamb raisers who do stick
to their guns. There is bound to be a
shortage of good sucker lambs, and who
can forecast wool prices?
It is possible to have a good
merino clip while producing fat sucker
lambs. For instance, a well-bred line of
Riverina five-year-olds cut me, last shear-
ing, 11-J-lb. per sheep while rearing 92
p.c. of fat suckers (by Dorset rams)
dropped in March-April. The whole drop
of these lambs was quitted at ruling
rates at five months old, thus leaving my
next clip pure merino. In the past
I have bred from first-cross ewes, but the
results were not so profitable as the
better clip, plus March-ALpril drop
lambs by Dorset Horns. During the last
eight successive seasons in this district
(Central Tablelands, N.S.W.), I have
lambed merino ewes to D.H. rams, and
not once have the lambs failed to mature
to marketable requirements under six
months old.
“W. D. Me.” (B. 24/1/’34) slates the
Dorset. In my experience, of the five
principal breeds of English sheep produced
in N.S.W., the Dorsets are the only breed
that will give a 92 p.c. drop and March-
April lambs. If “Anti-Dorset” and “W.
D. Me.” know of a better ram of Eng-
lish breed for the purpose, let them
name it.
DORSETS AGAIN.
“Pro-Dorset”: “Anti-Dorset’s” remarks
about Dorset Horns (B. 24/1/’34) create
considerable doubt in my mind as to his
knowledge.
In his opinion the wool is coarse, and
for that reason he calls the Dorset a
“coarse animal.” This term when applied
to a mutton sheep must be taken to mean
that the meat is coarse, and the export
trade conclusively shows that this is not
true of the Dorsets. As to wool, I refer
“A.-D.” to E. H. Pearce’s “Sheep Farm
and Station Management,” in which it is
stated:
The wool, classed as medium grade, is closely
set and level on the surface; the wool of the
lamb is specially valued for its whiteness and
other superior qualities.
“Anti-Dorset” doubts whether an
owner can sell the lambs. Lamb-market-
ing is simple to a capable manager who
knows when to mate to suit the average
season. He has the fact that the lambs
mature earlier than those of other breeds
R. L. GRANT, noted Scottish Aberdeen
breeder.
in his favor. Alfred Hawksworth, F.T.C.,
says that “the Dorset Horn will put on
flesh when on rough, tussocky pastures to
a greater extent than any other breed of
sheep.”
A further objection raised is that the
D.H. always prefers his neighbor’s pad-
dock to his own. I have had considerable
experience with the breed, and I find that
the sheep will not jump efficient fences
except under great provocation. They
may go under six-wire fences, but that
is the extent of their so-called roguery.
Here are a few of the many reasons in
favor of the Dorset: They give an in-
crease of over 100 per cent. Wool from
pure Dorsets sold in December, 1933,
realised 13d. per pound, unclassed, with
skirtings, bellies and locks thrown in.
Lambs weighed (live weight) 511 b. at 48
days, grown on natural grasses. Lambs
at four months old weighed 1071 b., and
3i-month lambs sold by auction in a
20,000 yarding brought 4s. per head more
than any other lambs in the yarding.
THE DODDY’S FRIENDS.
Abbotsford Quarantine Station (Syd-
ney) just now has one of the finest show-
ings of imported Aberdeen Angus stud
stock ever seen in Australia, and the men
pictured on this page are mainly respon-
sible for it.
A. J. Tanner is one of the best-known
all-round stock judges .in Australia, and
A. J. TANNER, an eminent judge of
cattle.
though his interests are primarily with
the Shorthorns and the Herefords —his
family have bred the latter for genera-
tion in England, where his brother Craig
is in the first line of contemporary stud-
masters and judges—he took the secre-
taryship of the Aberdeen Angus Society
some years ago because he recognised
the sterling qualities of the doddies as an
adjunct to the other breeds if Australia is
to produce an ideal range of baby beef
for British markets. It was old Robert
McDougall, of Arundel, the greatest
breeder of Booth-type Shorthorns Aus-
tralia has seen, who first advised the
black poll for certain types of Australian
country, and he would probably chuckle
with glee to see a first-class, English-
trained stud-master making a great suc-
cess of his advocacy of a typical Scottish
animal.
A.J.T.’s secret vice, apart from
cattle, is pigs. He held a Berkshire
championship of the Sydney Royal Show,
of which he is a councillor, for many
years, and if ever Governments develop
the common sense to put the Australian
pig industry on an export basis on which
it can compete with Denmark, whose
trade in some years has been worth as
much as our dairying industry, Tanner
would be the man to do it, if he could
be dragged away from the cattle industry
—a move which would certainly be re-
sisted by the host of leading cattle stud-
masters who have implicit faith in him.
R. L. Grant, for long a highly success-
ful Scottish Aberdeen breeder, is “Angus
right through.” When he landed the
consignment of stock just now in quaran-
tine, somebody asked him what hotel he
intended to stay at. The reply was: “A
thenk Aa’ll bide in th’ Quarantine Hotel
wi’ ma beesties.” Several years ago he
retired from breeding, and since has de-
voted his “leisure” to the improvement
of the breed, which he has judged at
all the great shows of the world, iriclud-
ing the Sydney R.A.S. His idea of
Heaven is about a million acres of good
neap and grass land in a reasonable
climate, populated by endless droves of
sleek and glossy blacks. One of these,
days somebody will catch him unawares
and make an Australian of him.
SHEEP SPECULATION.
‘‘Junee”: The high prices ruling for;
store sheep are purely speculative. Young
wethers which last season brought from.
7s. to 10s. are realising from 20s. to 255.
I saw a line of 5000 two-tooths sold in.
Riverina last week at 255. 6d. cash, and)
there was nothing exceptional about
them. “Gummy” ewes, whose normal
value is a couple of bob, are up to 10s.
Paying these extreme prices is gambling
on the weather and the wool market—
a notoriously risky business. I have no
objection to dealers so long as they keep
within reasonable bounds, but taking wild
risks is bad for the industry.
SEPTIC TANKS AND SAFETY.
“Shovel”: “Pick” (B. 3 /1/’34) describes
a farmer’s septic tank which would give
moderately good results, but which would
be unduly large and expensive to con-
struct. He is somewhat astray in his
theory.
As he states, a septic tank is merely an
underground cistern in which the sewage
is retained long enough to allow sus-
pended solids to settle. If it is to deal
with latrine wastes only, a convenient
formula to determine its minimum size
allows 300 gallons plus 10 gallons for
each person served (i.e., for a family of
six persons a capacity of 360 gallons
would suffice). The tank should be twice
as deep and three times as long as it is
wide, and inlet and outlet pipes should be
protected by baffles 6in. from the end
walls and extending across the full width
of the tank. The baffles should extend
from 9in. below to 6in. above water
level.
At intervals of about two years the tank
should be emptied and the accumulations
of sludge and scum disposed of by
burial. About a kerosene-tin full of the
ripest (i.e., the blackest) sludge should be
replaced in the tank to “seed” the incom-
ing sewage with the appropriate bacteria.
Popular fallacies to which “Pick” sub-
scribes are (a) that the effluent from
a septic tank is harmless ; and ( b ) that the
“septic” action depends on the exclusion
of air from the tank. Septic-tank effluent
is less unsightly, more easily disposed of
in soakage pits and less putrescible than
raw sewage ; but if dangerous bacteria
exist in the raw sewage there is no
guarantee that they will be removed in
the septic tank. To exclude air from
the tank is unnecessary, and good ven-
tilation is desirable. The film of scum
with which the liquid soon becomes
covered prevents any absorption of atmo-
spheric oxygen in the sewage.
For aesthetic reasons the tank should
be covered with substantial planks or
concrete slabs, but the whole of the cover
should be removable to allow desludging.
Don’t worry about the watertightness of
the tank unless it is situated where ground
water might be polluted by the seepage.
In such situations, even an ostensibly
watertight tank is a danger.
SOIL EROSION.
“Eos”: Erosion (B. 27/12/’33) went on
before man was evolved on earth. It takes
and gives. It created the best present-day
agricultural lands and all rich delta lands.
One who has viewed the yellow flood of
the Yang-tze-kiang, the Irrawaddy, the
Ganges, the Amazon and Rio de la Plata
as well as rivers in Australia such as the
Mulgrave and also New Guinea rivers,
might wonder that any soil remains for
erosion.
Agricultural lands, Australian and
U.S.A. excepted, carry on unperturbed
because soil formation proceeds at greater
rate than erosion. Decaying vegetation
quickly becomes soil. In agricultural

AUSTRALIA’S Highest Quality Motor Spirit
P 45
Europe, organic manures of high humus
content are carefully accumulated, and
are ploughed into the fields in addition to
crop stubble, cover-crops and weeds. In
tropical agriculture in N. Queensland,
sugar cultivation inclusive, special humus-
forming cover-crops such as Mauritius
bean and other legumes, rich also in plant
food, amply counterbalance erosion
by rain and floods. On Green Hills, N.
Queensland’s largest plantation, the soil
remains unaffected after countless cen-
turies of tropic soil erosion and with fer-
tility unimpaired. Cane trash, weeds and
cover-crops ploughed in it maintain and
increase the fecundity of the soil. Para-
doxically, white agriculturists in tropical
Australia are more energetic in soil pre-
servation than their confreres in the tem-
perate south.
When agricultural land in Australia
becomes scarcer and is more generally
occupied, agrarians of necessity will
“make” soil to counterbalance natural
erosion.
A WEEKLY PRIZE FOR A HINT.
Hints for farmers have always been a popular
feature of the Man on the Land Page, and the
little volume of them published by The
Bulletin has had a wide sale.
Lately, the supply appears to have dried up
somewhat, and in order to encourage a re-
newal of the flow The Bulletin has decided
to offer a regular weekly prize.
In addition to space rates, which will be
paid for all hints published, £1 Is. will be paid
for the best hint of the week.
Hints should not exceed 100 words in length.
Every land man has some method or con-
trivance about his place calculated to make
work easier or farming more profitable. Give
the other chap a chance to benefit by your
experience through the Man on the Land Page.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Gumblegubbin”: Drilling lime in with
the seed is more economical than spread-
ing it over the field and harrowing it in.
This is especially true of crops grown in
rows.
“Karaway”: When putting up a light
shed on blocks or log sleepers, instead
of mortising the uprights into the ground-
plate and wall-plate, nail a batten to the
top and bottom ends; the whole line
of studs can be placed in position at
once, and secured by nailing the battens
to the plates. This saves time and labor,
and suits the technique of any amateur
carpenter.
“8.J.C.”: A common mistake in tanks
is to have the down-pipe running from
the top down the outside. Thus clean,
fresh water is drained away as soon as
captured. The pipe should, starting from
almost on the bottom of the tank, run up
inside, over the top and down the out-
side. In this way the dirty water and
sediment on the bottom are carried off.
“Hatter”: Give hens sour skim milk ;
it means both more and larger eggs. The
size of eggs does not depend on the num-
ber laid, but on such factors as food
quantity, proportion of animal protein
meal (which is superior to vegetable pro-
tein meal), plentiful supply of lime and
sufficient green food. Skim milk, of
course, supplies the necessary protein, and
appears to do so in the most digestible
form.
“Terence” : To make a solid indoor
separator floor, thoroughly mix equal
parts of sandy soil and super.—the lot
which got wet and caked so that it would
not go through the combine will do if
broken up pretty small. Moisten with
enough water to make a firm paste and
lay down. Before it is quite dry, freely
apply (with a brush) a good thick coating
of liquid super.
“The Lad”: For an excellent renovator
for sod-bound pastures, especially pas-
palum, take an ordinary log-roller and
trace lines on it lengthwise, about six to
eight inches apart. With a half-inch bit
and brace drill holes 6in. apart and 3in.
deep, so that every four are in diamond
formation and no holes in successive lines
are directly opposite each other. Make
enough eight-inch spikes from half-inch
iron to fill all holes. One end of each
spike should be sharpened and the other
jagged to hold it in position. Drive the
spikes into the holes for the full three
inches with a heavy hammer.
“Ab”: A simple method of preventing
an engine block from becoming covered
with oil and grease is to cut a piece of
galvanised-iron lin. wider and 3in. longer
than the block. Turn up jin. all
round so as to form a tray 2in. longer
than the block. Then at one end bore a
hole to allow a piece of jin. pipe, about
2in. long, to be soldered on. This will
drain all oil away into a tin or bottle
below. The tray is soldered at each
corner and fitted between the engine and
block. It saves oil and makes for clean-
liness.
“Eureka”: If you cut a horse’s mane
and tail and wish it to grow again quickly
mix sulphur and sweet oil to a consis-
tency of cream and apply three times a
week, rubbing it well in. Before each
application wash the parts well with soap
and water.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED,
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Each year as my nectarines begin to ripen
they split, shrivel and mostly fall. Most of
the fruit is spoiled. What is wrong ? —9932.
It is impossible to say definitely. It would
appear that the cracking of the fruit is due
to excess moisture and humidity. Specimens
might be posted to the Under-Secretary, Agri-
cultural Dept., Box 36A, G.P.0., Sydney, when
further information may be obtained.
(1) How do beekeepers arrange ventilation
of hives during hot weather ? (2) Do Hawkes-
bury and Wauchope supply Italian queen
bees, and, if so, prices ? (3) How is a queen
bee introduced into a colony ? (4) Can bees
from one colony be mixed with the bees of
another colony ? If so, how ? —9BOB.
(1) Beekeepers provide additional ventilation
for bees when the colonies show the first signs
of clustering outside the hive during heat. The
front of the hive is lifted up and small wedges
to raise the hive a further |in. are placed under
the corners between the hive body and the
bottom board. (2) Both, at the following prices:
Untested, 7s. 6d. each, post free: tested, 12s.
each, post free. Ten queens supplied for the
price of nine. Nuclei colonies, with queens,
above prices, plus 255.; freight paid to any
railway station in N.S.W. (3) Queen bees are
forwarded from a queen-rearing apiary in a
combined mailing and introducing cage. To
introduce the queen to a queenless colony, with-
draw the cork from the food-compartment end
of the cage, remove the label, and fit the cage
in the hive so that the bees have communication
with the queen through the wire-cloth screen.
By the time they eat out the candy the
queen should be sufficiently introduced to be
accepted. (4) It is usually safe to place a
comb of bees and brood from a populous
colony into the brood nest of a weaker hive
direct. To unite two colonies it is advisable
to place a sheet of newspaper between them.
When free communication has been established
by chewing through the paper they become
reconciled.
(1) Is the. land around Dubbo (N.S.W.) suit-
able for wheat-growing and fat-lamb raising?
(2) Approximate price of the land ? (2) Could
you advise a district in N.S.W. where a man of
small capital could start ? —9721.
(1) Yes. (2) It varies considerably in price,
according to whether the land is close to a
railway or whether it consists of river flats, but
an average price may be taken as about £5 per
acre. (2) The land in the Dubbo district should
be satisfactory for a man with moderate capi-
tal to make a start in.
THIS WEEK’S PRIZE HINT.
A prize of £1 Is. has been awarded
to “H.N.W.,” Elizabeth-street, Tam-
worth, N.S.W., for the following;
To repair holes in tanks, water
troughs or leaky roof gutterings, get
a bar of fresh—not hard or dry—
soap. Shave the soap and sprinkle
fine cement free from lumps over the
shavings. Knead well with fingers,
and the soap should absorb three
times its volume of cement, and
should resemble putty. Press the
mixture well into the holes. If a
tank is full, place a bandage (to be
removed in a week) to hold the
filling in position. The success of
the repair depends upon the soap
holding the cement in position until
it hardens, after which it defies re-
moval.

Where Will It End?
Gold is the international legal tender.
In Britain, the U.S.A. and most other
civilised countries the bank- and Treasury-
notes in circulation before the war could
always be exchanged for gold by any-
one who wanted to pay a debt in an-
other land which would recognise no
paper currency but its own as legal tender.
The necessity for actually sending gold
from one country to another did not
often arise; but the public knew that
gold was always available if wanted, and
consequently had faith in paper pounds
and dollars.
The war upset everything. Nearly
every Government in Europe was com-
pelled to dishonor its obligations to pay
gold on demand for paper currency, and
to finance the sinews of war there was
a general inflation of note issues. Gov-
ernments paid for munitions in paper
promises which, in France, .Belgium,
Germany, Italy, Russia and Austria, were
all devalued when those countries even-
tually stabilised their currencies. Thus
after the French stabilisation one sov-
ereign contained as much gold as 124.2
francs, whereas before the war the gold
content of the £1 was equal to only 25.2
francs. In many countries this legalised
repudiation was on a.much greater scale.
Britain was the only European bel-
ligerent to honor her paper on a pre-
war gold basis. The valiant, ill-judged
return to the gold standard was made in
1925, when British costs were still 50 p.c.
higher than in 1913. The result was to
make the exchange cost of the £1 so
high that British goods were too dear for
foreigners to buy. On the other hand,
the position of London as financial centre
of the world was strengthened.
Until forced off the gold standard in
1931 by the flight from sterling, the policy
of the British Government was to im-
prove the purchasing-power of the cur-
rency until it reached pre-war level. That
was deflation. In this policy of reducing
commodity prices Britain stood alone.
Europe’s misfortune was largely
America’s good fortune, and the U.S.A.
came out of the war a creditor nation
controlling one-half of the world’s gold.
The influx of gold, however, caused a
cheapening of the metal in U.S.A., and
an unprecedented boom in commodity
and share prices resulted. The subse-
quent crash was terrific, and, when
foreign countries which were having
troubles of their own went off the gold
standard, the inevitable high exchange
rates blocked out American goods.
U.S.A.’s abandonment of the gold stan-
dard in 1933 was premeditated and deliber-
ate, as were the recent devalution mea-
sures. Tied to gold, President Roosevelt
found that his internal price-raising plan
further crippled exports. “Off” gold, and
with £500,000,000 to bear the devalued
dollar with, he hopes to make dollars so
cheap that American goods will be cheap
for foreigners to buy. Britain, of course,
will try to protect her exporters through
the exchange equalisation fund.
Where is it all going to end? Will
Roosevelt’s scheme result in competitive
devaluation and inflation between export-
ing countries? Or will Britain line up
with America and agree to stabilisation
with less gold in the sovereign and a new
fixed ratio to the 60-cent dollar?
I. A. Agnew, chairman of one of the
largest gold-producing organisations in
the world, expressed his opinion in Lon-
don in December as follows:
We are convinced that gold will continue to
find eager purchasers, that for all purposes of
this generation and the next its price in terms
of sterling will not be appreciably inferior to
the present level, and may be considerably
higher, and that world recovery is ultimately
only possible on the basis of a general return
to a gold standard at revised parities.
The concluding remarks suggest a sov-
ereign containing less than the present
123 grains of gold. Many conservative
British interests would sooner see de-
valuation and stabilisation than the pre-
sent nightmare of erratic exchanges.
The Bracey Plan
“King D.”: I’m not a Douglas Credi-
ter or a Lang Planner, and I believe in
paying the piper for whatever troubles
we bring on ourselves through extrava-
gance or foolishness. But, monetarily
speaking, we are just a mob, very badly
led; in the hurry and scurry of making
money not many of us realise when we
are creating a boom that must eventually
bust, with shocking hardship to those
who are thrown out of employment. The
banks might—sometimes they do —try
to enlighten us when we are pursuing an
unhealthy path ; but my experience of
banks is that in good times they go
around begging you to increase your
overdraft; as soon as bad times come
along they are down on you like a ton
of bricks.
There should be more central control
of monetary affairs, though I don’t sug-
gest socialisation. H. E. P. Bracey, of
Lithgow (N.S.W.), has a scheme for check-
ing booms and slumps that seems to have
merits —more merits than Roosevelt’s
New Deal, for instance. He proposes
to relieve unemployment by issuing just
sufficient currency to pay all those on the
dole a bare living wage, and to give
them work. This extra currency would
give business a fillip, and should tend
to raise prices and increase the circula-
tion of money. As soon as industry
showed signs of revival, those on the
bare national wage would be on the look-
out for jobs in private industry paying
wages that would provide extra comforts,
and gradually those on the national pay-
roll would be absorbed, and the issue of
currency would cease. Bracey has
worked the scheme out many steps fur-
ther than this; in the right hands it
should be controllable, and in turn it
should control over-expansion of credit,
without any change in the capitalistic
system. It’s not a matter of giving
something for nothing ; it’s just some-
thing instead of nothing for those who
are willing to work.
United States external trade in 1933
showed a slight increase over 1932, ex-
ports ($1,675,000,000) being $64,000,000
better than in the previous year. Imports
in 1933 were $126,000,000 heavier at
$1,448,000,000. The favorable trade
balance ($227,000,000) was $62,000,000
lighter. The New Deal didn’t, work to
plan right from the jump ; instead of
the adverse exchange blocking out im-
ports, there was a wild scramble on the
part of U.S. manufacturers to buy all
the tin, wool and other raw materials
they could before the dollar fell further
and increased their costs. Hence the
greater rise in imports than exports, and
the smaller trade balance.
* * * *
During the first nine months of 1933
205 principal American industrial com-
panies earned profits of $200,000,000, as
against $30,000,000 in the same period of
1932, the average return on funds being
3.6 p.c., as against 0.5 p.c. General
Motors realised 12.6 p.c., as against
1.5 p.c. But the iron-and-steel in-
dustry was still operating at a
heavy loss —15 cos. in this line dropped
$26,662,000, as against $48,850,000. Four-
teen petroleum concerns with net assets
of $840,000,000 showed losses of
$4,443,000, as against profits of
$6,121,000 in 1932. The building, elec-
trical, coal and machinery trades were
still having a bad time. The steadiest
earners in U.S.A. appear to be baking,
food-manufacturing and chemical busi-
nesses.
* * *
The dried-fruits industry gets another
lift; Maoriland is to admit its raisins and
lexias duty-free while placing a duty of
Id. a pound on foreign produce. It will
be a very useful market for growers.
* * * *
Petrol prices have been increased a
penny a gallon by the major oil com-
panies in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide
and Brisbane —to Is. 6d. a gallon for first-
grade and Is. sd. for second. The Purr-
Pull Co., whose entrance into the trade
coincided with the beginning of a series
of cuts, culminating in the lowest price
ever charged, has not yet decided to move
from Is. 6d. Two years ago first-grade
was 2s. 3d. The reason given in Brisbane
for last week’s increase was that Is. sd.
was below world parity. At the petrol
inquiry it was stated that the fall in the
local price was in keeping with world
conditions. Independent opinion in the
motor trade is that Australian petrol
prices have been unremunerative for
some time.
* * * *
According to the president of the N.
S. Wales Chamber of Automotive Indus-
tries, the average number of cars bought
each week in N.S.W. for the five years
ended 1929 was 740. The weekly aver-
age in the next three years was 288, 83
and 84, rising to 106 in the first half of
1933, and 181 in the second half; a
greater recovery is now anticipated.
Looked at statistically, the position is this.
At the end of 1933 there were 153,000
passenger cars registered in N.S.W. Put-
ting the average life of a car at eight
years, about 20,000 new cars would be
required annually to maintain the num-
ber now registered. The rate of purchase
in 1933 fell short of this by two-thirds.
If the eight-year car-life estimate is cor-
rect, sales will have to increase or the
cars on the road will decrease. The jump
in wool-prices and increased employment
should help the trade; very few of those
who haven’t had the cash to pay in full
have bought cars during the depression.
Formerly 70 p.c. bought on terms; at
present only 30 p.c. do.
* * * *
Though petrol prices are up, tyres are
down, for the third time in six months.
Goodyear, Dunlop and Barnet Glass
standard products were cut p.c. on
February 1, and cheaper lines now cost
5 p.c. less.
* * * *
After August 1 Maoriland tellers will
be handing out the new Reserve Bank
notes, dnd paper of the two local and
four Australian trading banks will be
gradually withdrawn from circulation.
The right to issue notes has always been
a source of profit to the private banks,
but special taxation has been levied on
such profits of recent years. . The first
issue of the new notes will be a tem-
porary one.

“Tops”: London “Daily Express,” a
journal whose opinions on what is going
to win the 2.30 may be valuable, has
been laying it doWn that, though Nippon
is importing “vast stocks” of raw wool
from Australia, we shall not always have
this market. Reason: “Mongolia is
the best wool-growing land in Asia, and
is to be the home-farm for the Tokio
mills.” The winter temperature of Mon-
golia runs far below the zero mark. No
such country has ever yet produced a
wool to vie with the fine merino types
which Japan so consistently mops up at
our sales ; actually, no wool from Mon-
golia is fit for anything but the coarsest
of felting. No amount of breeding, even
if the necessary stud sheep and the
peculiar pastures and climatic conditions
were available, can ever help Mongolia
to supersede Australia in fine-wool mar-
kets. What should worry us is the
breeder who, for the sake of the heavier
fleece, is producing-a type of coarse wool
not much better than the average Mon-
golian.
* * * *
“Selangor”: In spite of the disastrous
experience of the Stevenson restriction
scheme, rubber-growing interests are
considering another dip at something
similar. A modified scheme has been in
force for some time, but, since the market
has been heavily oversupplied, the small
private grower, who wrecked the Steven-
son plan, has not found it worth while to
rush the market as he did before. Much
will depend on whether the Netherlands
Indies interests back the new scheme.
American interests, including the Ford
concern, which at the time of the rubber
boom planted large areas in Mexico and
South America as a counterblast to re-
striction, will also have to be considered,
since these plantations must now be
yielding.
* * * *
“Fleet Street” (London): Consumption
of Australian wine is going up, but
there is still room for advertising our
better qualities. London’s cheaper pubs
are plastered with advts. for Australian
wine at 2s. 6d. a bottle. The Continent
didn’t establish the reputation for wines
against which the Empire is now trying
so hard to compete by stressing its
cheaper lines. Bruce’s recent tasting party
at Australia House did much towards let-
ting Britain know about our better vin-
tages. Laffer, the Wine Board’s rep., is
also doing good work in this way. Appa-
rently they realise that reputation is to
be won in West End cellars, not East
End bars.
* * * *
“Thirsty”: “Wild Kitty,” who com-
plains (B. 17/1/’34) that nothing has been
done in Sydney to market real fruit-juice
drinks, would be happier in Brisbane,
where there are dozens of drink bars,
and cafes that supply pure orange-,
lemon- and pineapple-juice drinks at four-
pence a large glass. At one you can pick
your own fruit.
* * * *
“Jakay”: Although the number of bales
of wool submitted at the Hobart sales
was less than last year—2l,l6o against
20,590 —the quality was high, the record
price of 40fd. being obtained by Keith
Downie, of Bothwell. The wool cheque for
the State should reach the million-pound
mark. The Speck is having a wonderful
tourist season, thanks mainly to the tem-
porary lifting of the Navigation Act
clauses, so a good apple year now would
do much to restore prosperity.
* * * *
“G.D.M.”: A small three-storey frock-
shop building in Swanston-street, Mel-
bourne, two doors from Bourke-street,
has been sold at £2OOO a foot. The
highest price ever paid in Melbourne was
£3300 a foot for the Equitable Build-
ing site at the corner of Collins and
Elizabeth streets. That was in 1892, the
last high spot in land-boom. The total
cost of the land and building was
£363,000.
* * * *
“Zip”: There is a big market for Aus-
tralian oysters in the Old Country ; the
British industry was ruined through cross-
ing the English bivalve with an unsuitable
American relation. As much as seven
and eight shillings a dozen is being paid
for oysters in London. Exchange and
the comparative low cost should make
exporting from Australia a profitable pro-
position. England has excluded Con-
tinental oysters.
* * * *
“Rex”: Speculation is ever rife about
the intentions of the Derwent Valley
Paper Pulp Co., Ltd., which has extensive
concessions in the Florentine Valley dis-
trict (Tas.). The co. has bought 150 acres
near New Norfolk, upon which it has
had an option for some time. Effort
in the upper reaches of the Derwent Val-
ley is mostly confined to timber work,
and this has been interrupted by the
damage done to horse trams by fires.

HERE’S the 1934 sensation in tyre value!
The famous double-tough Perdriau, the
tyre that is shattering all records for mileage
throughout Australia, now reduced a further
7£%, bringing prices to a level 23% lower
than that of six months ago.
Yet—though prices were never so low—
Perdriau quality has never been higher.
Perdriau is built inside and out to stand
gruelling work and deliver mileage long
after an ordinary tyre is worn out.
Perdriau double-tough tread rubber stands
the modern car’s acceleration, higher speed
and severe braking better than any tyres on
the road because it is made by an exclusive
process.
Now, while these super tyres cost less than
ever in history, make your motoring safe,
comfortable and truly economical. Oppor-
tunity is waiting—but not indefinitely! See
your local dealer and get his quote for a
complete new set. DO IT NOW i

that with his very modern appliances, in-
cluding engine-driven air-supply com-
pressors which enable divers to work
better and longer and take a much
greater quantity of shell than his Japan-

“Pat Bushie”: Tell “Frigid” (B.
17/1 / ’34) every district registrar is
authorised to celebrate weddings, and
many women hold such appointments in
Queensland as well as the other States
of the Commonwealth—mostly in the big
cities, which are divided into several
registration districts. Furthermore, there
are now in Australia certain women
clergy who are also licensed to marry.
A search of the N.S.W. register shows
two lady ministers. One is a Salvation
Army lassie residing in Sydney ; the other
is the Rev. Joan Mary Flore, 8.A., a
Congregationalist, of 165 Everton-street,
Broadmeadow, Newcastle (N.S.W.). I
know she has celebrated a marriage—I
saw her do it.

“El V.”: I apologise to “Brian J.” (B.
17/1/’34) and all the pioneers for saying
that General Spencer Browne was a
“seventh-generation Australian.” My only
excuse is that when I wrote the paragrapn
I had just received a bunch of income-tax
assessments from several States, colonies,
Commonwealths and dependencies, and
The Man for N.G.?
“Fi. fa.”: “Gain” (B. 24/1/’34) stulti-
fies his own argument against a medi-
cally qualified Administrator for the
Mandated Territory by asserting that “if
he does his job properly he is in constant
danger of contracting mortal fever and
horrible tropical diseases.” A tropically
trained doctor is thus, by “Gain’s” own
showing, the only possible man for the
job, since he possesses the requisite
knowledge for keeping himself fit and
healthy. Even the “barrister with the
status of a Supreme Court Judge,” to
whom “Gain” refers with such respect-
ful awe, would be of no administrative
use when full of malaria and “horrible
tropical diseases” as a result of ignor-
ance of the elementary rules of health -
protection in the tropics. “Gain” evi-
dently realises this, for he rather grimly
limits his candidate’s period of endur-
ance to “only a year or two.”
In discarding British precedents for
such an appointment, “Gain” does not
appear to have heard of William Mac-
Gregor, who, in a few years, with very
little help from outside, changed British
New Guinea from a dark country of
dangerous cannibals to a land of peace
and order. Plenty of other successful
British Administrators have found a
medical training helpful in their job. The
most able and progressive of the Ameri-
can Governors of the Philippines was
Leonard Wood, originally a doctor. And,
in the Mandated Territory itself, the
former German owners used medical
men as Administrators, to which fact is
due the excellent planning and construc-
tion of Rabaul and the principal out-
stations.
“Gain” proudly describes his Queens-
land selection as “a master of routine.”
To anyone who knows the Territory
from outside the red-tape viewpoint, this
is a most damning indictment, for, even
more than political meddling, routine has
been the curse which has clogged de-
velopment. What is urgently needed is
someone who has the clarity of vision
and the strength of purpose to lift the
whole official Rabaul crowd clear out of
their rut of routine, even if they perish
from exposure, as did quite a number
of masters of routine in the old days in
Papua when MacGregor took over.
Local knowledge and experience should
count heavily in such an appointment,
provided they have been gained under
conditions which enable their possessor
to remain free from local red-tape en-
tanglements.
To Gain” all this doubtless sounds
like a lot of useless rot. But, from
the League of Nations’ standpoint—and
the League is the ultimate judge of
whether the Territory will continue under
Australian government—the native and
his interests form the crux of the whole
matter.
There is one Australian who fills the
Three years’ administrative work,
medical and otherwise, in New Guinea as
a military officer, 1915-18 ; two years as
administrative M.O. in Malaya ; a world-
wide tour to study medical and other
aspects of tropical administration for the
Australian Government; three more years
m N.G. reorganising the medical service ;
six months on a League of Nations sur-
vey of the South Pacific on health con-
ditions and native policy; a wide know-
ledge of native languages and customs ;
the knack of handling the white man’s
burden so that he doesn’t want to give
trouble ; experienced, moreover, in con-
trolling white and colored staffs in office
and field; a pleasant-mannered chap
withal, and just on a robust athletic
40. His name is R. W. Cilento, and he
is a second-generation Australian. But
he’s no good at “routine” as interpreted
in Rabaul.
“Lapi-Lapi”: V. J. Clarke, owner of
Australia’s most up-to-date pearling fleet,
is shifting to the Dutch Aru Islands.
There he proposes to fish the Aru
waters, keeping outside the three-
mile limit and replenishing his luggers
with water and supplies from Thursday
Island, which will also be his export point.
The idea seems to be that the invasion
or the Aru beds will hit the earnings of
alien poachers, all of whom hail from the
Aru fleets, so hard that they will find it
useless to carry on with their enterprises
on the Australian side. Clarke claims
“No; certainly not! You can't have your goldfish in your bedroom.”
felt that I must have lived at least seven
generations myself to incur them all.
What I should have said was that the
general belonged to a family which was
now in its seventh Australian generation.
Incidentally, it would be interesting to dis-
cover what family in Australia can span
to the roots of Australian history with
the fewest generations. I set as a stan-
dard the late Nicholas Lockyer, who died
last year, and whose father, Major Lock-
yer, gave his name to the district below
the range in Queensland and founded the
first Westralian settlement in 1827. I
also nominate my old friend Harry
Bracker, just dead, whose father and
mother were married in Brisbane the
year after pastoral settlement was
founded in the northern State.

“Rankine”: We all have our private
jokes in the N.T. Mine is the half-
column (about 800 words) which appears
in every issue of the “Government
Gazette” headed “Compulsory Enrol-
ment.” There are not 3000 whites in the
Territory, but they can’t say, even if
their representative hasn’t got a vote in
Parliament, that they have any excuse
for not taking an interest in elections. As
the weekly notice tells us, we all have to
enrol or transfer our enrolments within
21 days from the date on which we be-
come entitled. If we are camped on one
waterhole and shift to another, 30 miles
away, we must saddle up, get an enrolment
card from a police station —which some
of us wouldn’t go near, seeing the state
of our taxation laws —or a post office or
a registrar at Darwin or Alice Springs.
Some of our gallant electors here are,
therefore, compelled to do a trip of six
or seven hundred miles if they want to
keep within the law, or else trust to the
post, which calls (per favor of the passing
swaggie) once in three months. In that
case, of course, they break the 21-day pro-
vision. The fine for a first offence is 10s.
I suppose this sort of thing helps to fill
up “Government Gazettes.” It certainly
does nothing else.

“N.X.T.”: Nelson, M.P., is getting a
lot of support in his agitation for an in-
quiry into missionary activities in the
Northern Territory. Arnhem Land is a
native reserve, and any ordinary civilian
who wanders into it, no matter how laud-
able his objective, is liable to strike
trouble if he is caught. (Many, of course,
go without getting caught.) Neverthe-
less, within the area is the Oenpelli Mis-
sion station, which, besides being subsi-
dised, is allowed to run a cattle station
and shoot buffaloes. There can, of course,
be no supervision of operations by the
Government, and I have yet to hear of a
mission which pays its black workers any
wage beyond a bit of tucker and an
occasional stick of tobacco. Meanwhile,
the Warren expedition, with the best of
intentions, is wandering round Caledon
Bay, pausing every now and then in its
labors to wireless that the Caledonians
are as mild as milk. If Arnhem Land
is a native reserve, it should be a native
reserve and not merely a piece of coun-
try preserved as a missionary monopoly.
The old men of the tribes can manage
their own affairs very well, thank you,
without any advice from anybody, and
to leave matters completely in their hands
is the only sane way of preserving the
aboriginal race.

“Adolphus Fitz Lenin”: As one of the
local out-of-works I rise to protest
against The Bulletin’s frequent re-
marks about the Darwin unemployed and
their ways. We are not as otner unem-
ployed. Since the days, a few years ago,
when it was recorded often in the papers
that some of us were the only people who
arrived at the Darwin races in taxi-cabs,
we have established an aristocratic tradi-
tion which is even officially recognised.
It you don’t believe me, you should look
at the “Government Gazette,” from
which you will perceive that when they
serve us tea it isn’t ordinary post-and-
rail but the best. We are supplied with
Bushell’s Blue Label —their best packeted
brand at 2s. 9d. per pound in Darwin
or 2s. lOd. at Pine Creek. The “Gazette”
calls the extra penny paid at the Creek
“a small margin for freight”—in other
words, the Government charges itself Id
per pound, or £9 6s. Bd. per ton, for carry-
ing the precious commodity 150 miles on
its own railway, or about Is. 3d. per ton
per mile and three times the sea freight
from Ceylon to Sydney. Some of us, of
course, can’t drink Indian tea, so they
provide us with Hang Mee at 2s. 6d. and
2s. 7d. per pound. Then we get A 1 sugar
and Australian No. 1 rice, flour, tobacco
and matches and salt; so, as beef is to
be had for the asking, it isn’t such a bad
thing to be “destitute”—l use the official
word for us—in this part of the world.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
Numerous cups of tea have been poured for
Marjorie Morcom, who leaves for England
shortly. Marjorie is a pillar of the Bush Book
Club, and also belongs to the subcommittee
which looks after the Diggers at Rosemount.
On February 8, in Sydney, wedding bells will
ring for Kathleen Searle, daughter of our H. E.
T. Searles. The lucky man is Harold Bower-
ing, elder son of Mrs. M. Bowering, of Cre-
morne. As Kathleen and her father and mother
leave for Sydney only two days before the
day fixed for the ceremony, there will not be
much time for last-mihute shopping.
Eleanor King, just retired from her job as
principal clerk in the Government Savings Bank,
London,, has been making the mouths of
Queensland girls who have bank billets water
with envy. In the London G.S.B. each woman
employee gets six weeks’ holiday every year,
six months’ full pay in case of illness, and
when her service is finished a pension. Eleanor
is holidaying m Australia. This is her third
visit, as she has relatives here. Maurice Besley
the composer, is a brother-in-law.
Mrs. Lance Jones (she was Gwen Dulhunty,
the “squatter’s daughter,” and one of Bris-
bane’s prettiest debutantes in the early war
days) is back from Landon. Mrs. Jones tra-
velled by the Maloja, in which were the Hon.
Alexander Shaw, with his wife, Lady Margaret
Shaw, and daughter. Mrs. Mcßobert, whose
daughter Margaret went overseas with her nearly
a year ago, also returned to Queensland. Mar-
garet, who was a capable and charming press-
woman, has a job in the P. and O. office in
London, and has not made any plans as yet
for returning home. Editors have cast a kindly
eye on several of her sketches, which have seen
print in some of the best-known English maga-
zines.
Mrs. Malcolm Cameron, who has been spend-
ing some months in Brisbane, is returning
to Sydney to prepare for her trip to
Canada, where she will stay with her recently
married daughter and visit relatives in Ottawa.
After that it will be the old countries for her.
She expects to be away at least a year. Mrs.
Harry Sheppard, Mrs. Cameron’s daughter, who
was here with her for a few weeks, has returned
to Sydney.
Ella O’Shea, that kindly and delightful
hostess, to whom so many young musicians owe
their first step on the ladder of fame, is packing
up her frillies to accompany brother Pat to
America.
A rally of beauty, brains and bravery, accord-
ing to the slogan inscribed on the dinner invi-
tation, met at the Cosy Dell Cafe on Wednes-
day night, when the Queensland League of
Youth was formed. A hasty glance round the
room proved conclusively that hope is not the
only emotion to spring eternal in the human
breast. Vanity seems to linger quite a while
also. Many of the males present had come
to 40 years, and they were the first to explain
how glad and bad and mad they were—and
how youthful! Gilbert Taylour, who was busily
engaged for the latter part of 1933 in sending
abroad hampers of happiness, and whose motto
always is “Buy Queensland Goods First,” spon-
sored the gathering, which is to be followed up
by a public chivoo in the City Hall.
The league possesses a saxophone octette, and
unless a body’s ears are properly attuned the
melodies they discourse seem to have an ageing
effect. The league says it is out to remove
stodginess and timidity. May it succeed!
The members of the Windsor Croquet Club
spread themselves during the week, when Mrs.
Charles Taylor (wife of the former Speaker)
and Mrs. Frank Hall (whose husband is the
well-known architect), both of whom had cele-
brated a golden-wedding anniversary within a
couple of days, were tea-ed and toasted. Mrs.
Hall is the president and Mrs. Taylor the vice-
president of the club, and Chas. Taylor, M.L.A.,
is the club patron. A large wedding cake, pre-
sentation bouquets and flattering speeches all
combined to bring back the atmosphere of the
day which was celebrated 50 years ago. Mrs.
M. A. Jones, who was Mrs. Hall’s bridesmaid,
was a guest.
The ranks of the Victoria League in Queens-
land will be sadly depleted this year, as most
of its members seem to be packing for trips
abroad.
Mrs. A. E. Moore, chairwoman, passed the
festive bun in their honor during the week, the
intending tourists including Tessa Reading and
Miss J. A. McLeod, Mrs. Scott Mullin and
daughter Del (the latter, by the way, is a clever
sugar chemist) and Mrs. W. Smyth. Mrs. John
Stitt, Miss McLeod’s sister, also was present.
Bulimba House, the home of the A. E. Moores,
provided a delightful setting for the party.
Betty Gross is back from Melbourne, where
she has been studying the methods employed at
the Collmgwood Nursery School, which she
now will apply to good purpose. She is about
to open a nursery school early this month in
the Guide Hall at Ascot. As this will accom-
modate children between the creche and kinder-
garten ages, she should find it easy to gather
in pupils. The decorations, the gay little desks
and chairs and the accessories should delight
any child and make teaching easy.
Misses Margaret Brown and Brabazon (of
the Glennie Memorial School, Toowoomba) and
Miss M. E. Sutton, who guides the destinies
of the Glennie Prep. School in the Downs city,
have just returned from China, where they spent
their vacation. Miss Sutton has one claim to
fame which no other school ma’am yet pos-
sesses. When the Glennie Prep. School was
moved from Herries-street to its present site
Miss Sutton bought a ’bus and obtained a
driver’s license. Every morning she drove a
’busful of children to school from the board-
ing-house, and each night she returned them
to their dormitories. The ’bus only plied until
the whole building was completed, but the pupils
were very regretful when it was no longer
reauired.
Report has it that talkies are to be made
in Queensland, and that 90 per cent, of the
cast and staff will be recruited here. The most
unlikely people have their little hopes and fears,
and respectable mothers of families, ladies of
avoirdupois and social standing, are revealing
their innocent desire to caper on the silver
screen. At present the whole affair is wrapped
in “hush-hush,” but when—or if—it comes to
anything, the unfortunate soul who has to in-
terview aspirants to fame is likely to be blinded
for life by the first rush of stars.

Information Sought.
(1) When did Jimmy Clabby, recently re-
ported to have died of starvation and exposure
in America, first come to Australia ? (2) Who
was his first opponent at Sydney Stadium, and
did Clabby win ? (3) How many contests
did Clabby have on his three visits to Aus-
tralia ? (4) Who defeated him here, and when
did he last appear in a ring ? —7O.
(1) In 1910. (2) Bob Bryant, whom he de-
feated in seven rounds. (3) Forty-four con-
tests in Australia and M.L. (4) Dave Smith
(twice), Jeff Smith, Les Darcy (twice), Fred
Kay, Tommy Uren (twice), Albert Lloyd, Billy
Shade and Frank Burns. Clabby’s last appear-
ance was at East Chicago on July 31, 1923,
when Morris Schlaifer knocked him out in two
rounds.
(1) In the estimation of cultured musicians,
can a brass band make real music ? (2) /
understand that some of the best brass bands
in the world were and are recruited from
Lancashire mill employees. How does that
affect the question ? (3) Has any really great
composer taken the trouble to write music
solely for wind-instruments ? —4O.
(1) Emphatically yes. Musicians of the
highest culture have trained, conducted and
judged brass bands, and reckoned their time
well spent. (2) Natural intelligence is not a
monopoly product of universities and high
schools. Anyway, those Lancashire lads had,
and have, good teachers, who educe talent. (3)
Yes: Beethoven, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Cheru-
bini, Berlioj and Meyerbeer. Also, J. P. Sousa,
whose mastery of his craft and outstanding vigor
and originality have been praised by many emi-
ment composers in other media. His achieve-
ments and those of Richard Wagner and a
long line of other operatic and orchestral com-
posers who have recognised the dramatic value
of the brasses as an orchestral ingredient have
vitally affected latter-day musical development.
7 am the owner of a car-trailer registered in
N.S.W. Would Ibe allowed to use this trailer
for touring in Vic., carrying passengers’ lug-
gage and camping outfit ? —9838.
Yes, if you get a visitor’s permit, and
don’t go in for the carriage of goods
for hire or in the course of trade. If the car
or trailer is to be used for the carriage of
goods for hire beyond a distance 20 miles from
the point of entry, either the car or trailer,
whichever is so used, must be registered in Vic.
Should passengers be carried for hire, the
vehicle carrying the passengers must be regis-
tered, irrespective of the distance it is brought
into Vic.
(1) Is a passport necessary to a visitor to
Singapore ? If so, where could I get one ?
I live at Townsville. (2) Any restrictions against
Australians entering the Straits Settlements? (3)
Where could I obtain information regarding
employment there ? (4) Fares from Townsville
to Singapore ? —2.
(1) Yes. Application should be made to the
Passport Office, Customs House, Townsville.
(2) No restriction is placed on Australian-
born British subjects taking up residence
in Singapore, provided they have definite em-
ployment or means to maintain themselves, and
do not become a charge on the Settlements. (3)
Write to some of the leading commercial houses
in Singapore. Most of the civil appointments
in Singapore and the Malay States are made
in London. (4) First class, single, £45; return,
£81; second class, single, £3O; return, £s4—in
Australian currency free of exchange.
(1) What are the most usual marks on genuine
Wedgwood ware? (2) Who was the designer
of the reliefs on the Portland vase ? Anything
known, about him ? (3) How many of them
were made, and are any still extant ? —77.
(1) All ware coming from the Wedgwood
factories is genuine Wedgwood, but the ware
made by the first Josiah Wedgwood after
1760 was marked until 1768 with the
single name Wedgwood in fairly large capi-
tals ; about 1768-69 the name was used in foul-
different sizes of type. From 1769 to 1780
the name of the firm, which was Wedgwood
and Bentley, was used. The names were placed
one above the other, and were also used
in four sizes; they also appeared in
raised lettering in a circular impress mark,
usually a little over lin. in diameter. On the
basalt, Etruscan, and variegated vases the word
Etruria, the name of the factory, was added.
On small intaglios the initials W. and B. were
often used, but after the death of Bentley in
November of 1780 the single name of Wedg-
wood appeared alone. (2) John Flaxman, a
sculptor and draughtsman, who designed and
carried out a number of public memorials.
Wedgwood sent him to Rome to study ancient
examples. (3) Fifty copies were made of the
Barberini vase, a glass amphora acquired by
the Duchess of Portland. It was copied in
blue-black jasper with white figures in relief.
About 20 are known to be in museums and
private collections.
(1) How to grow lavender and rosemary ?
(2) How to use for perfumes ? (3) Is there a
market for lavender and rosemary in Sydney .'
—9999.
(1) Both can be propagated from cuttings
placed in light soil up to the end of March.
Pieces of wood which have flowered are prefer-
able. (2) Pick the lavender flower-heads when
they are in full bloom and dry them in the
sun, then place them in silk bags. Rosemary
tips can be dried in airtight bottles to be used
in baths or placed loose in wardrobes. (3)
Many small shops which have no nurseries
would no doubt consider purchasing them,
either green or dried. Rosemary is especially
saleable at remembrance times, such as Anzac
Day and Mothers’ Day.
What textbooks will be required for the 1934
N.S.W. leaving certificate examination in (1)
English, (2) French ? —9878.
(1) Prescribed books, Shakspeare, “Macbeth,
ed. Verity (Cambridge Uni. Press); “Three Cen-
turies of English Essays,” ed. V. H. Collins
(Oxford Uni. Press). Approved books for
general reading, Hepple’s “Lyrical Forms:
Sonnet and Idyll” (Cambridge Uni. Press);
“Silas Marner,” any complete edition; and
“Narrative and Descriptive Prose Passages, ed.
Bald and Kirwood (Oxford Uni. Press) (2)
“Cinq Maitres du Conte Francais,” ed. J. G.
Cornell (Shakspeare Head Press, Sydney).
(1) What is the definition of a del credore
agent ? (2) Is he responsible for bad debts in
the absence of a written agreement to indem-
nify his principal ? —9887.
(1) An agent for sale who undertakes to pay
if the buyer becomes insolvent; but such an
agent does not guarantee the due performance
of the contract in the sense that the seller may
sue him in respect of disputes arising under
it. Such disputes must be fought out between
the principals, the agent only guaranteeing that
the buyer will prove solvent. (2) Yes.
Where was the Mermaid Tavern in London,
and how did it become famous? —9973.
The tavern, which stood in Cheapside, with
side entrances in Friday-street and Bread-street,
and was destroyed by the Great Fire of Lon-
don, was the meeting-place of the Mermaid
Club, founded by Sir Walter Raleigh. Ben
Jonson, Beaumont and his collaborator Fletcher,
Donne and Shakspeare were members. In
their day the tavern was noted for its Canary
wines.
What are monsoons, where do they start and
finish, and are there monsoons without rain ?
—9944.
A monsoon is any wind which blows regu-
larly at fixed seasons, mainly applied to those
winds which blow over the Indian Ocean from
Australia to India. From April to October
they blow from the south-west; from October
to April they blow from the north-east. Their
regularity is caused by the regular change of
the seasons; during the winter the cold air
from the interior of Asia flows outward in a
general south-westerly direction towards the
warmer sea. When the land becomes more
heated than the sea the direction of the current
of air changes and flows inwards. In parts
of India the s.-w. monsoon is accompanied by
violent thunderstorms and torrential rains. The
rainy season in Bengal is ushered in by the
n.-e. monsoon. It sometimes happens that the
monsoon fails to bring the expected rains, and
the result is such famines as occurred in 1895
and in 1899.
What constitutes a double bezique ? Have
the two queens of spades and the two knaves
of diamonds to be placed on the table at the
same time, or could a single bezique be played
first and at another time the remaining two
cards ? —9959.
According to latest modern authorities simul-
taneous presentation is not required. The
single bezique having been scored, double
bezique is the same combination again declared
by the same player with fresh cards.
What was Lombroso’s theory as regards the
existence of a criminal class, and is his theory
accepted by leading criminplogists ? —9856.
The net theoretical result of Lombroso’s re-
searches in criminology is that the criminal
population exhibits a higher percentage of phy-
sical, nervous and mental anomalies than non-
criminals, and that these anomalies are due
partly to degeneration, partly to atavism. The
criminal is a special type of the human race,
standing midway between the lunatic and the
savage. This doctrine of a “criminal type”
has been gravely criticised, but is admitted by
all to contain a substratum of truth.
I desire to use gum arabic for gumming tips
of receipts. What method and mixture should
be used to prevent the gummed paper from
curling when dry ? —9775.
Assemble 1 part gum arabic, 1 part starch,
4 parts sugar and sufficient water to give the
desired consistency. Dissolve the gum arabic
in some water, add the sugar, then the starch,
and mix thoroughly; then boil for a few
minutes to break the starch, and thin down
with boiling water to the desired consistency.
If to be kept liquid, add a little boric acid as
a preservative. Curling can only be prevented
by thoroughly pressing the paper when it is
stacked after drying.
(1) Is the length of day at the Equator
always 12 hours ? (2) Are the sun’s rays at
the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn ever as
direct as at the Equator ?— 9445.
(1) Precisely on the Equator the time from
sunrise to sunset is always 12 hours, assuming
sunrise and sunset to be when the sun’s centre
touches the horizon. (2) At the shuimer solstice
in the Northern Hemisphere (June 22) the sun’s
rays are vertical over the tropic of Cancer, and
at the summer solstice in the Southern Hemi-
sphere (Dec. 23) they are vertical over Capri-
C °(!) 1 have planted a number of Westralian
flowering gums which have all struck ana are
growing well . Some of them are %ft. f others sft.
high. They seem to me to be growing too tall and
spindly. Should I cut the tops back or leave
them alone ? (2) I have three Christmas bushes.
The calyx on one is beautiful and very thick.
On the others a black kind of blight has taken
all the color from each bush. The first-men-
tioned one is sheltered and gets plenty of
water; the other two, though only a few yards
away, do not get so much moisture. How can
I remedy the blight and improve the trees!
—9846. , , _
(1) It is not advisable to cut back flowering
gums, as nothing would be gained. They are
not the best of trees for shape, and do not
respond kindly to the knife. (2) An agricul-
tural drainpipe should be fixed perpendicularly
18in. from their base and the plants watered
down these pipes; the moisture so placed will
pull the roots down from the surface, where
they are evidently not happy. The pest is
probably an annual one, and should disappear
under better root conditions.
A portion of my garden is exposed to all
weathers. What plants or shrubs are suitable
to brighten it against drab surroundings ?
9984.
Cannas are good for the position. They
stand hard conditions, are quick growers, and
have blooms of vivid and varied colors. Soak
the seed for 15min. in warm water before sow-
ing ; root-clumps are also obtainable from
nurserymen. Among shrubs, hibiscus, Spanish
broom, veronicas (purple and red) and camel-
lias will stand hard conditions. They must
be staked firmly to cause upright growth, especi-
ally where strong winds are met with.
(1) How to treat maidenhair ferns which have
died off ? (2) The best fertiliser for ferns in
baskets? —9993. . .
(1) Burn off the foliage, top-dress with light
loam, and soak the baskets in a tub or tin of
water every few days. (2) It is not advisable
to use chemical fertilisers on ferns; weak
liquid cow manure is all that is necessary.
Many gardeners find it helps if a little bush
charcoal is added.
How to remove iodine stain from a watch
ccisc ? —9915.
Avery small quantity of potassium iodide
in a few drops of glycerine may be painted on
the stain, rubbed off, then rubbed again with
a drop or two of olive oil. This should shift
the iodine, but if it has eaten into the metal it
will have to be repolished. Better take it to
a watchmaker if it is valuable. Milk is a
solvent for iodine if the stain is not too old.
(1) Approximate cost of reboring and fitting
new pistons and rings on a 1928 Essex car in
Sydney ? (2) Cause of the cut-out points stick-
ing when the engine is stopped ? —9926.
(1) If the cylinder block is sent to Sydney
stripped, about £9. (2) May be due to insuffi-
cient air space between contact points, or to
pitted or dirty points caused by Tong usage,
excessive generator current or insufficient spring
tension. Anew cut-out may be purchased for
ss. or 6s.
What are the properties of narcotine ? —9964.
It is an alkaloid occurring in opium. It is
nearly insoluble in water, sparingly insoluble
in alcohol and readily soluble in chloroform
and ether. It has slightly alkaline properties,
is a derivative of benzyl-isoquinaline, and
among its products is “vanillin,” well known
as the flavoring principle of vanilla. Its salts
are not readily crystallisable, are more bitter
than morphia, and its sulphate is used instead
of quinine in India; its chief use is as a source
of the medicinal substance cotarnine.
Meaning of the term “brachycephalic” ?
9657. , , , ~ ,
A term applied to skulls the breadth of which
is more than eight-tenths of the length. The
heads of most individuals of civilised races are
brachycephalic, and the development of width
in comparison with length in the skull has been
generally taken to indicate increasing brain
development.
(1) Who designed the present pictorial stamp
issue of Papua ? (2) What values are included ?
(3) Date of issue ? (4) Have these stamps been
overprinted “OS” or “Airmail” ? Will they
improve in value ? —-9940.
(1) F. E. Williams (Govt. Anthropologist)
and E. Whitehouse; some of the designs were
copied from photographs taken by F. E. Wil-
liams and Gibson. (2) Usual values up to 2s„
also 2s. 6d., 55., 10s. and £l. (3) November
14, 1932. (4) No. (5) The higher values should
be worth holding.
Value of unused M.L. penny-postage stamp
(lilac) issued between 1860 and 1885 ? The
design consists of the head of Queen Victoria
in profile and contains the words “New Zealand
postage.”- —9762.
These stamps were first issued in 1874.
Printed on white paper, they are catalogued at
from 4s. 6d. to 325. 6d.; on blued paper, from
3s. to 30s. Yours is probably the common
variety.
I have two very stained old engravings. They
are not of sufficient value to send to a print
restorer for cleaning, but they are subjects of
which we are fond, and if you could give me
a formula I would try cleaning them myself. —
9925. ' , .
Obtain from a chemist a solution of liquor
calsischlorate (1 in 40). Take the engraving
from its frame and any mount which may be
on it, and lay it quite flat in a shallow dish.
A photographic dish is suitable. Pour cold
water over the print and leave until it is com-
pletely saturated. Pour off the water slowly,
and flood the print with the solution. Tip the
dish to keep the solution moving a little until
the stains have disappeared, then pour off the
solution, which will do for several prints.
Flood the print gently with fresh water, which
should be changed frequently until all the
chemical is washed from the print. The paper
will be by now rather pulpy, and will need
careful handling. To restore its hardness make
a very weak solution of isinglass, and if the
print has become too white in the cleaning,
tint the isinglass with a little coffee. Soak
the print in this for a while and then remove
very carefully by pouring off the isinglass and
placing a sheet of clean blotting-paper over the
print, turning the dish upside down so that the
print is turned out on to the paper. Place
more, clean blotting-paper on the top of print;
cover with a smooth board and a weight.
When dry, cover the surface of the print with
a sheet of clean glazed paper and press on
top of the glazed paper w\lh a warm iron.
This will restore the “gloss” which has been
lost in cleaning.

AUSTRALIANS AS HORSEMEN.
WHEN the Deputy-Premier of N. S.
Wales said Australians were “the
best horsemen in the world” I
submitted that unless the boast could be
proved our public men should stop mak-
ing it. “Circle Dot,” who describes him-
self as a 60-year-old Queensland drover,
has had a couple of tries at proving it.
He gave the names (B. 31/1/ ’34) of a
number of Queenslanders who perform
the following feat “day after day”:
Racing the bullock off the mob, the rider
jambed his stockhorse on to him just as the
bullock jumped a fallen tree about four feet
high. As they landed he threw the bullock
and, lighting on his feet, simultaneously pulled
the bull strap from his shoulders, jumped on
the bullock’s rump and strapped him down by
the two hind legs.
“Circle Dot” issued a warning that
anyone who doubted that this feat was
performed day after day by many
Queenslanders would prove himself a
miserable creature obsessed by “the ran-
cor of a city-dweller for the best class
of Australian in our continent, the back-
country stockman.”
This ruled me out, so I sought an
opinion from a well-known sexagenarian
drover whose identity I will veil behind
the letters “8.L.” “8.L.” spent his
mative years with the celebrated “Bar
O” outfit, Arizona (U.S.A.), but he claims
to know Queensland as well as “Circle
Dot.” I give his decision verbatim:
“Lissenere, big boy! These Aussie cowboys
is phoney, see! The woild’s best riders is in
Arizona. Ever hear of Pizon O’Grady of ‘Bar
Y’? Or Broncho Simpson of ‘Bar U’? Or
the Brannigan brothers of ‘Bar X’? Or Tex
the Wop of ‘Bar B’? Or the McDougall kids?
Or the Bernoni sistern? I’ll say you hain’t.
Well, son, all of ’em acts as follers reg’lar
before breakfast every morning. Dashes at a
mob of mustangs. Grabs two outlaws apiece—
yellin’ fit ter bust theirselves, ’cos it’s all a
joke ter guys like them —and, with a foot on
each wittier and holding on by the bronks’ left
and right ears respective, they rides the blank-
ards to a standstill. Proofs? sez you. 80, I
know a guy as knoo a guy as seen it done.
Day after day! And anyone as don’t believe
me, why he merely proves hisself a low-down
city louse which has a rancor for the best class
of American in Gahd’s Own Country, the Wild
West stockman.”
Inevitably “B.L.’s” story resembles
“Circle Dot’s.” Similar arguments have
been used in countless millions of bars
down the ages in the twelve hundred and
odd cattle countries of the U.S.A., S.
America, Europe, Asia, etc., to prove that
the horsemen of the area to which the
speaker owes allegiance are the world’s
best. Almost always when the speaker is
confronted by a level-headed expert he
hears some such debunking truth as was
uttered by that experienced backblocker
William Hatfield (B. 31/1/’34):
The only man I could find in all the cattle
country of s.-w. Queensland last year v/ho
could throw and tie a beast for a shot in one
of my films was Tommy Norman (now nearing
50), of whom everybody interested in horse-
manship has heard.
And if he had found a good rough-
rider, or a dozen —men as good as Sku-
thorpe and Norman, Waite and the
Dempseys were thirty years ago—what
would it have proved? To quote him
again:
Every country herding stock in the open
produces good horsemen. The Arabs, Tartars,
Berbers, Mexicans, Cossacks, Argentinians and
Texans all have to do the same class of work
on horses bred in similar conditions, so why
should Australians imagine they are the world’s
best?
Many who would like to imagine it are
obviously beginning to have doubts them-
selves. Australia always has some good
flat-race riders, and every now and then
it sends a champion or near-champion
abroad. Naturally; flat-racing is the
national sport. Yet the best “Circle Dot”
could say (B. 31/1/ ’34) for Pike was
“He is the equal of any jockey in my
memory, which goes back to Tom Hales.”
The point is not “Is Pike as good as
Hales was?” but “Is he better than
£*»&"
his opinion on the subject.
similarly, “R.C.W.,” in the same issue,
claimed, not that our horsemen were the
best, but that they could hold their own
with any in the world”—a much more
modest proposition .
J. Rundle’s contribution was that his son
won a war-time hunting competition at
Grantham (England) It is equivalent to
saying that, because his son won a tennis
competition in Woop-Woop, he is in line
for purposes of world comparison with
p erry . Does he imagine that contem-
porary English horsemen of the stamp
0 f Arthur Nightingall competed in Gran-
tham hunting competitions?
Nearly all the writers make the mistake
assuming that horsemanship—the
beautiful and difficult art which has been
p rac ti S ed assiduously by most of the
superior j races, whii and colored, for
thousands of years—isn t horsemanship
at all; and that rough-riding is. Rough-
riding is what its name implies—eques-
trianism’s humble, ill-paid offsider.
Thousands are able to pick it up quickly ;
Mr. Rundle, for example, has only once
been thrown from a buckjumper, and
he has ridden hundreds of bad ones,
Horsemanship, properly so-called, is an
incomparably more difficult art. We may
have some rough-riders who are as good
as the best in other parts of the world ;
there is no evidence whatsoever that we
have any who are better. We have no
exponents of military horsemanship
whose names are known outside their
ow n districts, and no exponents of the
horsemanship of the polo-ground hunt-

FRIENDLY SERVICE
ALL THE TIME
Some of the time, if not all the time, you must save money, but
if you are Mr. Average Citizen you know that all the time is nearer
the mark.
Whatever your margin on any one week’s salary, it won’t provide
for a sudden necessity to pay, say, £5O or £lOO. No one week’s
salary will provide education for your children, heavy medical
expenses, or comfort in your declining years.
Therefore, to make provision for the big calls, you have to save,
more or less, all the time.
The Commonwealth Savings Bank provides a friendly, efficient
savings service—all the time.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
His wife’s were the only womanly eyes
that witnessed barrister F. R. Jordan being
sworn in as Chief Justice of the State.
Acting C.J. Harvey administered the oath
of office in his private chambers in the
Supreme Court amid a distinct absence of
pomp and ceremony. Premier Stevens,
Attorney-General Manning and a handful
of black-robed and bewigged figures made
up the company. The day after the
installation the State Governor and his
lady went off to Maoriland by the Mono-
wai, so Chief Justice Jordan holds the
additional office of Acting-Governor for
the next three weeks.
Sydney is being taught to traverse the
roadways at right angles. We all cross in
a bunch now, same as in Melbourne, and,
in so doing, must keep to the left. It
has been great fun, and the girls haven’t
minded it a bit, except that it meant
wearing their best silk stockings, because
really those traffic policemen were quite
good-looking enough to deserve it. Cer-
tainly, well away from the eye of the
Law, this Letter saw one young thing skip
off the pavement in Pitt-street, on a line
with Dalley-street, and step up on to it
again at Bulletin-lane. After a month’s
marshalling, however, the sole will be
above such momentary lapses.
Isabel Crowdy, who arrived in Aus-
tralia with Sir Phillip and Lady Game
and became probably the most popular
private secretary in Government House
annals, has got a new job. She has been
appointed information officer to the
Orient Company at its headquarters in
London. Miss Crowdy knows this State,
at least, very thoroughly, as it fell in
with her duties to accompany the vice-
regals when they went abroad in the land.
She made Australian friends in all walks
of life.
The flowers were like a horticulturist’s
dream come true at the Wright-Laycock
nuptials last week, and the guests still
talk of them with a little indrawn hiss of
wonderment. Then, of course, there were
the presents —crystal, linen, china, clocks,
paintings,* furniture and cheques—in such
numbers and varieties that you’d hate the
job of writing the insurance inventory for
them. Wanawong, the George Wright
home, was lush with rugs and carnival-
like with awnings for the reception on
the verandahs, and out beyond the green
lawns stretched equally-green paddocks,
the perfect sylvan setting for a wedding.
Heaven help the poor dancer, male or
female, this coming winter! For trains
sweep majestically or flirt out with a fish-
tail movement on all the really devastat-
ing evening frocks. In the “five to seven”
raiment —the hours that so short a time
ago were dedicated to the cocktail
pyjama—the now-fashionable serene dig-
nity is very evident. Perhaps the pushing
of the upstart cocktail to the wall in
favor of the more conservative sherry as
an appetiser is one of the causes. One
“five to seven” seen at this Letter’s favor-
ite dressmaker’s the other day was of a
rich black material, like a silk velour.
It had a high neckline and long sleeves,
slightly bell-shape to the elbow and from
there narrowing into a long cuff much
buttoned. It was trailing in length, and
had a separate wide panel falling from the
waist and flowing into an ebon train.
Frocks to be even honorably mentioned
must cling in the most revealing way to
the figure ; so, Mae West or no Mae West,
there must be no layers of blubber about
your silhouette. Everything is cut on
the cross, and the line is the modern ver-
sion of the old Princess. If you want to
know how ravishing this can be, you
should see it in a Parma violet silk panne
velvet, slinky-trained and backless, or
in the palest water-green and gold-thread
damask that fits like a skin, has a two-
tiered peplum at the waist and finally
ripples out in a gold-crested wave of
train. This has its backlessness defined
by a square ; and that is much newer
than the V.
A camel’s-hair suit in brown flecked
with yellow, its seven-eighth (the newest
in length) coat fastened with great silver
hooks, a black-flecked white suit in the
same material with its Persian-lamb cape,
high about the throat to keep out the
draught—these were the two garments
of this writer’s desire in the early autumn
show. Snug neck-fittings are the thing
for day wear; cowl or draped toga
effects distinguish every second dinner
or dance frock. Black velvet with the
high neck and waist-length V at the back
is among the smartest when worn with
a long black velvet coat finished with a
white velvet scarf by a mannequin who
is all tapering waist and long slimness.
And, talking of slimness, to a party the
other night a fair girl with a wind-blown
haircut came in a black taffeta sheath
made with a boat-shaped neck, very puffed
short sleeves and a springy flounce. A
very wide silver belt gave the dress its
special character. But such a belt can
be worn only above a concave stomach.
If you only knew a crease as something
that runs down the legs of the best trou-
sers, you wouldn’t have dared to open
your mouth at the Australia the other
morning. There were cricketers’ wives
to the right of you, to the left of you and
in front of you, and in addition there
were the representatives of metropolitan
clubs. They were gathered together to
plan a Farewell Ball to the Australian
Test team. Jack Gregory’s wife is the
president of the committee weaving the
gaily colored streamer, and both the
Commonwealth and State Governors
with their ladies will put a vice-regal
polish on the affair. Alan Kippax, Stan
McCabe, Bert Oldfield, the cherubic
Brown, Don Bradman and other Ashes
collectors will be the highlights, and bud-
ding beauty will be present in the group
of debs, shepherded by Mrs. J. Taylor.
When Doris Louise Waraker left her
native Queensland she packed five plays
in her bonnet-box. Sydney liked the
plays so much (as well as the girl beneath
the bonnets) that all five were seized
upon for early production ; the big work
is a three-acter, “Restitution,” which
Enid Lorimer will present. The four
one-acters will be broadcast, and two
of them are now in rehearsal by the Im-
pressionists and by the Kooroora girls.
Doris is not without honor in her own
Brisbane, where she is known not only
as a playwright but as the author of a
book of sensitive verse, “Songs of Sun
and Shadow.”
Tattersall’s Club, the oyster which
hitherto only male magic could pry open,
last week allowed a womanly tea-party
within its walls. Nell Hill, daughter of
the club’s chairman, was the reason for
creating the precedent. She left by the
Ormonde on Saturday to further equip
herself for nursing, her chosen job in
life, and guests gathered at the bidding
of Mrs. J. A. Roles to wish her and her
friend Ruth Hatfield (another Nightin-
gale) “happy journey.” Eileen Shettle
poured her ’cello-like notes through the
afternoon. Miss Hill left the party plus
a travelling clock, a great basket of
greeny hydrangeas and a flagon of per-
fume.
This year will go down in history as
having been marked by an Australian in-
vasion of London. Last year, they will
tell you in some of the shipping offices,
they could scarcely get a full boat; this
year every bunk could be filled twice
over.
Janet Mitchell, the tall, dark subject of
this Falk picture, is still another Austra-
lian heading for Europe. Janet, a daugh-
ter of the Victorian K.C., has a well
furnished brain of her own. She was in
charge of the Thrift department of the
N.S.W. Government Savings Bank before
its doors were closed in the days of Lang
and co. More recently she has been
acting-principal of the Women’s College
while Miss Williams was away browsing
among the culture of other lands. Janet’s
sister Mary, who wrote “A Warning to
Wantons,” lately published by Heine-
mann, will join her in London later in
the year.
One of the best bits of news that E. J.
Tait has brought home with him is that
Strella Wilson is coming back to Australia
to sing lead in the J. C. Williamson pro-
duction of “White Horse Inn.” Strella
is a handsome girl with a star-quality
Australian voice, and she was one of the
reasons that the 1927-1929 Gilbert and
Sullivan operas had such a run. Since
leaving Sydney she has sung at Covent
Garden, but, of course, her big chance
came in C. B. Cochran’s production of
“Cavalcade,” in which she sang lead for
almost a year.
Australian members of the Forum Club
visiting London will find a real bit of
home when they meet the secretary of
the Overseas Section. She is Margaret
Baxter, a former Sydneyite, connected
on her mother’s side with the Toohey
clan. Ever since the Overseas Section was
started six years ago the genial and spark-
ling Margaret has been the organising
hostess of the club’s overseas Christmas
party. At the last giant turkey-carving
the guests of honor were the Dominions’
High Commissioners and their wives, and
asked to meet them were London’s social
and political world and Empire import-
ants. One of the singers was Mrs. J.
McLaren (soprano Millie Wynne, of Syd-
ney), wife of the official secretary at Aus-
tralia House. This Overseas Section
should seem a home from home to Aus-
tralians, for not only High Commis-
sioners’ wives but wives of retired Gov-
ernors are thick on its committee.
Here’s a tip from an expert if you are
about to put down a cellar. Sherry is
the best “keeping” of the grape-juices;
at 100 years of age sherry is still in its
prime, whereas at 50 port is already on
the down-grade. There’s a sherry to
suit every course, from the one “to open
the stomach,” as a kindly old French
friend used to say, to the dessert wine.
Besides, and this is a far more potent
reason with beginning hostesses, sherry
is the smart wine of the moment.
There was much excited tail-wagging
among the best dogs on the north side of
the harbor last week when the news of
H. R. Cordery’s wedding was noised
abroad. H.R. for years has vetted hun-
dreds of foxies, cockers, silkies, Sealy-
hams, Bitzers and Borderers, and even the
dogs who are patients of other vets, know
the popular practitioner by sight or
repute. His bedside manner with a tur-
bulent foxie who refuses his medicine is
something to be barked at during the
moment of direct action, but later on
boasted about. He and his bride (Mavis
Cawsey, of Mosman) will cruise around
Australia in the Cathay in March.
Brainy Arline Waddy—she often dips
her pen into poesy—is still another leav-
ing for England. Secretary for and ardent
believer in the Overseas League, she has
worked with enthusiasm to revive the
former glory of its Sydney branch, and
will now have a “close-up” of its big
headquarters in London. Arline belongs
to an old N.S.W. family famed in cricket
(i former headmaster at The King’s
School renowned for his prowess with
bat and ball is a relative), classics, and
the military cult of “Arms.” The Sydney
Overseas League farewells its hon. sec.
with speeches and an evening soiree on
February 16.
Mrs. White, author of “No Roads Go
By” and “For Those That Love It,” came
to Sydney for the cricket with daughter
Doris and other members of the family.
Cricket is the absorbing topic of conver-
sation in the station home, 142 miles from
Broken Hill. The Hill and White Cliffs
(a mere 60 miles away) are the Whites’
nearest approach to urban life. When
the family returns home Lionel Fenner,
son of Dr. Fenner, whose book on inland
Australia has lately been published, will
be waiting to blaze the trail of know-
ledge for the boys. Doris, who “can
ride a paddock as well as any of the
men,” has her eye set on a nursing
career, and plans to make a start in the
Children’s Hospital at Adelaide.
The wife of veteran journalist Gerald
Marr Thompson, who before her mar-
riage was Miss Pognon, a lecturer at the
Teachers’ College, Sydney Uni., was
among those who recently were handed
honors by the French Government on
the recommendation of France’s Consul-
General Dussap. Mrs. Thompson, who
is already holder of the Palmes
Academiques, has been nominated
Officier de l’lnstruction Publique.
The good-looking Frank Nixon couple
passed through Sydney the other day on
a holiday trek from Brisbane to Orange.
Their Sherwood home is flower-wreathed
in poinsettias and gorgeous with tropic
blossoms, himself being head gardener.
The tall lady with dove-grey eyes is
better known in the musical world as
Julia Nixon, member of Brisbane’s
Lyceum Club and composer of many
charming harmonies for songs and serious
compositions for the piano. Her best
seller, perhaps, is “The Barron Falls’ j
her latest productions, “High Day” and
“Evening Hymn,” have both been
recently used in most of the inter-State
and Queensland eisteddfods.
There has been a succession of excite-
ments in the Mann clan. First Wildflower
Hall, the old Mann home at Mount Wil-
son, was sold to a Macquarie-street
specialist; then the Walter Burfitts’ Esmey
went off to Europe on the Ormonde last
Saturday; now young Pat, only son of
the medical Paddy Morans, is being got
ready for entry to John’s in March.
Italian has replaced football in the
doctor’s list of hobbies, but maths, are
young Pat’s shining subject. •

Toilers tied by time were back on their
office perches on Tuesday after the
A.N.A. week-end, but* independent citi-
zens are drifting home reluctantly. Some
holidayers listened to the call of the
mountains, others went off to the Western
District for a taste of hospitality and
Camperdown, and thousands
chose the beaches. Cars purred or rattled
along the bayside roads. The really pro-
fessional campers had trailers for their
gear (thus stretching their legs in com-
fort), blow-up cushions and mattresses, as
well as such necessities as meat-safes and
folding chairs.
A blue bight on the map lured some
rovers to Apollo Bay. Here excellent surf
beaches curl their pale-yellow half-moons
round the feet of precipitous mountains.
Thence a road (for good drivers only)
twists over the Otway Ranges through
dense bush and cleared peaks and valleys
where cattle stolidly pull grass from a
giddy foothold. Surely the inhabitants
must take to yodelling, so isolated and
windblown are their homes. If you feel
the pangs of hunger and thirst there’s a
hostelry at Forest where you may wash
the dust out of your eyes in a bathroom
which brings you to level ground with a
thump. Above the tin tub is a warning
“Please don’t spit in the bath or waste
the water.” There’s a toll gate on the
Ocean-road, but most motorists, though
grumbling, agree that the scenery is worth
it. A shower of rain and the road is
closed, for there’s no room for a skid on
that narrow ribbon drilled out of the
cliff.
Wintry weather, exhilarating for
players and ponies but not so bright for
onlookers, blew up for. the polo at
Colonel and Mrs. Knox’s Kent Park.
It’s an annual picnic fixture, and teams
and barrackers from Melbourne and
Corranwarrabul were there in full force.
Mrs. Knox hadn’t enough crockery to
give everyone tea, but she entertained a
large party and made a tour from car to
car with a word of greeting for each
group. Bumpers and mudguards were
the best vantage points, and the contents
of hampers kept vitality high.
The Harry Creswicks—he’s president
of Melbourne Polo Club —the C. Le Plas-
triers, a carload of Pennefathers from
Berwick, Mrs. J. L. Byrne, Mrs. S.
Greayes and Mrs. C. A. S. Mansbridge
; their husbands all A-graders—were
among those who tooted horns long and
loud at each goal.
Jack Cato made this study-in-pensive-
mood of vivacious Mrs. Edward Dyson.
As a young girl the subject of the portrait
started to improvise; her first book of
songs was published when she was 15.
She won a scholarship to go to England,
and had barely embarked upon her study
of singing and dancing when she made an
early marriage. Afterwards she published
groups of bush songs and wrote music for
some of her husband’s verse. Edward
Dyson, who wrote so many good things
for The Bulletin, died two years ago
after a prolonged illness. Young daughter
June thinks she will study art.
Mrs. Stephen Margrett launched a
party at Cotswold in honor of the
Jhorold Harpers and Mrs. Harper’s sister,
Sheila Anton, which trio stepped off last
week’s mailboat. Green candles in silver
candelabra sprouted from a kaleidoscope
of floral effects. Mrs. Margrett was clad
in black matt crepe and a small velvet
headpiece. Her daughter, Mrs. Murray
Smith, was also in black, and another
daughter, Mrs. Spencer Harper, allied a
black shoulderpiece to printed faille. Mrs.
Thorold Harper honored the occasion
with gentian-blue and Miss Anton with
green and a few pelts of summer ermine.
Moving among the guests were the Alec
Catos, the W. G. Mcßeaths, Keith and
Anne Willis, Roy Anderson, Dr. and
Mrs. John Shaw and Dr. and Mrs. Ivan
Blaubaum.
Golf champions and partners Susie
Tolhurst and Sloan Morpeth entered
upon the great game of matrimony in
St. Peter’s, Mornington. There were
neither attendants nor wedding invita-
tions, and the time of the ceremony was
officially a secret. But golfing friends
couldn’t let two such brilliant stars go
off without confetti and good wishes.
Accordingly they did some detective
work and made an arch of clubs for the
newly-weds to step under. The bride,
who was given away by brother Keith,
chose Patou-pink for her gown and wide-
brimmed straw hat, and eschewed a
bouquet in favor of a horseshoe of pink
and white flowers. Mrs. Alfred Tol-
hurst entertained a handful of relatives
and an impromptu sprinkling of friends
at Woodcliffe, her summer home. The
’groom hails from Maoriland, and the
’moon will rise over his native Alps.
Under the wide expanse of summer
hat is Julie Russell, whose lyric and
dramatic soprano will soon be heard over
the air. Miss Russell, who studied at the
Albert-street Con. in Dame Nellie’s day,
has lately returned from 10 months in
Maoriland. Her intention in crossing the
Tasman was a holiday trip, but she
slipped into engagements for tours of the
Dominion and also gave lectures and song
recitals in the schools —she loved these,
and so did the pupils. Miss Russell is
keen on opera. She was with Joseph His-
lop and the Williamson-Imperial Opera
Co. Another of her accomplishments is
playing the harp.
Gwenyth Nancy McNaughton entered
St. John’s, Toorak, one recent evening to
emerge upon the arm of Herbert Vivian
Lang. For the bridal garment the
fashionable “dirty” pink swayed in dull-
surfaced lace from the kneeline, whence
it arrived in a tubular sheath. A ripple
of draperies took severity from the cor-
sage. Faintest pink shot through the
tulle veil which blew from a Juliet cap,
and water-lilies made a beauteous
bouquet. The sole ’maid, Mary Holds-
worth, wore a flyaway green medley, a
wide green sash and a tulle hat. Celebra-
tions were at the home of the bride’s
parents.
The Centenary Committee has changed
its mind over prizes offered for lyrics.
Poets who wish to compete must have
their inspirations on paper by February
28. Of the mass expected five lyrics will
be chosen (their writers each get £10)
and handed over to the musicians. They
compete for a £5O prize and may fit their
compositions to any of the five successes.
Toorak College Old Girls took the ad-
vantage of the long vacation to stage
their annual dance at the Frankston
seminary. The main schoolroom wore a
camouflage of pennants, masses of hyd-
rangeas and phlox, and the drawing-
room harbored tiger-lilies, red-hot pokers
and dahlias. The Misses Hamilton were
a dignified trio in black. Old Girls’
president Margaret Cumming, in white
flamisol blown with jnnk blossoms,
assisted the three principals to make
guests welcome. Margaret Knight, a dash
of cherry mingling and disappearing on
the cowl neckline of her white gown ;
Gwen Thomas, in sand-dune lace ; and
Barbara Carson, in floral transparencies,
audited and attended to the correspon-
dence. Among guests who drove to the
party through wind and scudding showers
were the Frank Faulkner, Harry Mel-
ville and Ken Clarke couples, Dr. and
Mrs. Ewen Downie, Joan a’Beckett, Mar-
jorie Sewell, Harvey Ansell and lan
Goodson.
The far-sighted woman is already off
on her autumn shopping. The new
tweeds are devastating and will do lament-
able damage to bank accounts. One
weave has a furrowed surface like the
bark of a tree; another sprouts long
white hairs (their suspected origin is
goat) which are knotted by the weavers
against moulting and inquisitive fingers.
Other beautifully soft materials are very
loosely woven in imitation of hand-loom
products. Designers have dipped into
geological books and stolen patterns for
their raised surfaces from pictures of
fossils, and they mix the fur of plebeian
rabbits with that of pure-bred, prize-win-
ning sheep. Checks, zigzags and cubist
ramblings are shown in modulated colors
for skirts and dresses, and next door are
their plain counterparts for coats. The
most ravishing materials which will sway
over glassy dance-floors are of matt-
velvet. Mingled with their slinky, dull
surfaces are stripes of silk thread.
Florence Armstrong, the only woman
geologist of the Westralian Geological
Survey, is having a look at Melbourne.
She was a delegate to the Australian
Federation of Uni. Women, which had
quite a bright time in Adelaide, in be-
tween doing bits of work. Miss Arm-
strong prolonged her vacation to a week
in the Apple Isle.
Joan McLennan, who pushes a secre-
tarial pen for Archbishop Head, has
crossed Bass Strait for a holiday visit to
his Ex. and Lady Clark. Ruth Flock-
hart, who has been using her year’s
leave of absence to musical advantage,
will walk down the gangway of a soon-
to-arrive mailboat. She is on the staff of
the Con. and M.L.C. A migrating musi-
cian is Beatrice Huckell: She and her
violin sail abroad in a few days.
From the City of the Black Swan:
Punters at the W.A.T.C.’s summer meeting
were grateful for the shade cast by the plane-
trees over the ring and in front of the tote.
Mrs. Ben Prevost’s lime-patterned oyster chif-
fons had an additional sun-shield of dove-grey
ballibuntal; Mrs. Aylwin’s pimpernel-figured
navy blue wafted a cowl coral swathe at the
neckline; Mrs. Lucius Manning topped claret
marocain with oatmeal pedaline; Edith Tre-
thowan’s voluminous tartan sleeves emerged
from mimosa green pebble crepe; circular bands
of white were faggoted into Mrs. Athol Nome’s
figured marine-blue mariette; Mrs. Geoffrey
Hearman’s white silk crepes were latticed with
scarlet; Mrs. Frank Lefroy’s cream georgettes
showed network traceries of electric-blue scrolls,
and Mrs. Bob Dickson’s bepintucked aqua-
marine flamisol was yoke-studded with chro-
mium adornments.
Bunbury tennis week-end started with a
dance in Mrs. Flynn’s home, organised by the
Sandridge Park Golf Club committee, whose
members assisted Mrs. Flynn in receiving.
Although most of the visitors from the city
and outlying districts arrived in time for the
shivoo the male complement appeared in a
medley , of attire ranging from flannels to black-
tie outfits. The womenfolk, of course, found
time to slip into conventional dance frocks.
Phyl and Gwen Brazier, Phyl Hawter, Katie
Venn, Nan Clarke and Molly Reading were
some of the local magnets, and moths flickered
around the charms of visitors Nancy Parker,
Grace Stapledon, Yvonne Renou, Pat Saw,
Molly Noble and a host of others.
The locally-constructed motor-yacht Silver
Gull has thrown off her party dress, donned
for Captain and Mrs. Gray’s frequent enter-
tainments on her decks, and manned herself
for work with a crew of Sea Scouts and a
marine biological research outfit. Mrs. Ernes-
tine Hill is accompanying the Grays on their
tour of the north-west coast, and readers of
her stories, which hitherto have dealt mainly
with Centralia, may expect a dash of marine
color.
Mrs. Hatch, of Lyons station, in rich fallow
lace and georgette, mustered a flock of nor’-
westers and turned them out to tea in the
Karrakatta Club’s winter garden. Booloo-
gooro’s Mrs. Campbell was there, and Yinna-
tharra’s Mrs. George Burt; Mrs. Ernie Hall,
who had just arrived from Wooramel, and Mrs.
Gordon Gouch, of Wandagee, were plied with
dainties by Beth Hatch, whose tiny crow hat
perched over sifted salt crep.e de Chine.
Nan Page Smith, girt with floral jade silks,
made a pre-nuptial appearance in the music-
room of the Palace Hotel as guest of Mrs. Ken-
neth Holmes, whose honey georgettes were
flecked with green. Teacups rattled during in-
tervals between musical items given by Zoe
Lenegan, Mrs. Leigh Thomason and Mrs.
Stewart Taylor.
Mrs. T. C. Wilson, vice-president of the
C.W.A., welcomed members from all parts of
W.A. at a basket tea arranged by Mrs. F.
Robinson, the metropolitan branch’s president!
About 60 representatives gathered in the Gov-
ernment gardens and made a social affair ol
the official picnic.
Cottesloe’s sands gleamed their silveriest and
its breakers rolled their curliest when the life-
saving teams gathered for their surf carnival.
Beach belles emulating the rainbow, gay um-
brellas mushrooming the beach and the colorful
outfits of the contesting teams made a fitting
background for the visiting North Bondi surfers’
victory in the closely contested premiership.
Adelaide’s Peggy Stoddart found her lime-
green linens enhanced by the liberal supply of
roses in Mrs. John Forrest’s lounge when that
lady afforded her an opportunity to say good-
bye to Perth friends.
Adelaide chronicles:
The civic reception given to the English
tennis-players in the room of the Lady Mayoress
was crowded. Pink belladonna lilies mixed
with dark prunus foliage looked effective as a
decoration. The Mayor’s daughter, Mrs. H.
Dunstan, took the place of her mother, Mrs.
Cain being in ill-health. Mrs. Dunstan’s beige
crepe toilette was relieved with peacock blue,
and her small fawn straw hat had a touch of
plumage in the same blue tone. She received
a posy.
Farewell cocktail parties are happening every
day as so many in the social world are off to
England. Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Wood, of
Gilberton, with their small son, leave this month
and expect to be abroad for a couple of years.
Mr. and Mrs. Philip Claridge, of Toorak,
gave a cheery dance at the Mt. Osmond Coun-
try Club to celebrate the coming-of-age of their
only daughter Dorothy. Autumn-toned flowers
decorated the club throughout. The hostess
looked well in almond-green satin, and her
daughter chose pale-blue organdie.
Prior to the departure of Mrs. Nutter
Thomas, with her Bishop, on a trip to England
the Mothers’ Union gave her a farewell tea
and some gifts in the Willow-room at Birk’s
Piccadilly.
Dorothy Finlayson, Walkerville, was hostess
at a tea for Evelyn Dunn on the eve of Miss
Dunn’s marriage to Don Downey. There were
about 30 guests, and everyone brought a kitchen
gift. Mrs. Alan Lendon gave Miss Dunn a
linen tea the following afternoon.
The first of many farewells to Lady Hore-
Ruthven was staged by the Royal British Nurses’
Association, who entertained her at the
R.B.N.A. Home. The guest was received by
Dr. H. H. E. Russell, Mesdames Martin and
Lindsay and Miss E. F. Davidson. Mrs. Martin
made a presentation of a sheaf of pink gladioli
and delphiniums. Lady Hore-Ruthven’s beige
crepe de Chine frock was spotted in brown,
and she wore, a brown straw hat.
Jim Holden, of Adelaide, and Prudence
Staughton, of Melbourne, are two of the many
contemplating matrimony in May. Inter-State
marriages seem to be the fashion. Arnold
Moulden and Irvine Wald have both recently
brought brides from Sydney, and in April and
May Mrs. Clive Milne’s two daughters will
marry, the one a Melbourne man and the other
N. Kater, of Sydney. From London comes
word of the marriage of Minnie, daughter of
Mrs. Richmond Baker, of Unley Park, in St.
Peter’s Church, Kensington, to Lieut.-Com-
mander A. Buchanan, only son of Alfred
Buchanan, of Neutral Bay, Sydney.
A few lines from the Speck:
Elwick looked picturesque in spite of smoky
surroundings on the day of the T.A.J.C. meet-
ing. The vice-regals were met by Col. D. P.
Young, Mrs. Young and the committee, and
were given tea in the pavilion. Lady Clark
was in black lace and georgette, with wine-
colored flowers in her headgear. The throng
included the Lieut.-Governor and his lady, she
in navy coat and skirt; Mrs. T. W. H. Clarke,
of Campbell Town; the James Murrays; the
Colin Bisdees; Mrs. V. Duckett (Melb.); the
Jones lady; Mrs. Alan Miller; Senator and
Mrs. Grant and Miss D. Grant; Mrs. Scantle-
bury (Melb.); Mrs. F. X. de Bavay, in sap-
phire-blue wool tweed; Commandant Whit-
ham’s wife, in a brown ensemble; the Rex.
O’Kellys; the Ashbolt lady, and Mr. and Mrs.
Thos. Lyons and daughter Sybil.
Partly to relieve the distress caused by the
bushfires, and partly for the society’s own
funds, the Red Cross Soc. held a big shivoo
at the Continental. His Ex. and Lady Clark
were there. The committee was headed by the
Ashbolt lady. Supper was all home-made, the
tables being done in a scheme of pink and
mauve. The vice-regal dame wore purple lace,
very becoming to her silver hair. Among
mainland visitors in the crowd were Mrs.
Bryan Foster (Vic.), Miss Abbott (N.S.W.),
Miss H. Leary (Melb.), Dr. and Mrs. O.
Latham (Sydney), Mrs. F. Warner (Q.), H.
Murray (Vic.), Miss Hill (N.S.W.), and Mr.
and Mrs. Sam Cox (Sydney). The Lewis lady
and the Mayoress wore black, and Mrs. Mary
Parker was in black lace.
St. George’s severe interior burst into bloom
with pink and white decorations for the wed-
ding of Jean, youngest daughter of the Deputy-
Mayor and Mrs. L. A. Saunders, and J. R.
Rex. The bride’s frock of heavy ivory satin
was severely cut as far as the knees, where it
fell in full flares. Her veil of old Limerick
was lent by Miss Eva Rex. Madge Saunders
and Margaret Rex ’maided in pale-pink crepe,
and a wee trainbearer, Jean Wilson, was in
pink-spotted net with wide sash.
Gwendoline, only daughter of the A. Smiths,
Hobart, and Harry, only son of Senator and
Mrs. C. W. Grant, High Peak, announce their
engagement.

BY VANCE PALMER.
AS the train edged into the country
station, going towards town, a mud-
spattered sulky came flying down
the quaggy road parallel to the line, the
driver leaning forward and frantically
flogging the lean half-draught into a
canter. Sprays of water flirted up be-
hind the crazy outfit as it splashed
through the lying pools. .It dashed over
the wooden bridge into the main street,
where the tin-roofed stores and houses
seemed to be steadily dissolving in a sod-
den rain that had gone on for years. Not
another live thing moved anywhere;
there was only - the solitary soldier stand-
ing erect on his granite block among the
four municipal trees, gazing from under
his marble hat at the peeling signboard of
the Royal Hotel.
In the r train sleepy figures uncoiled,
rain-misted windows went down with a
bang, rumpled heads emerged in
curiosity. A hundred eyes moved from
the guard tramping over the wet cinders
with his little green flag to the sulky
bearing down on the muddy station-yard.
Voices ran with a ripple along the line of
windows.
“Cutting it a bit fine, aren’t they?....
They’ll do it: we’ve got milk-cans to
take on. ... It’s all right: the guard’s
seen ’em.”
With a squelch the sulky drew up near
the cindered embankment, and from the
mound of wet umbrellas and drenched
sacking a girl in a plum-colored raincoat
emerged, springing lightly over the wheel
into the mud. For a moment she stood
like a marooned cat, the oily fluid seeping
over her snakeskin shoes, while her grip
was handed down to her ; then she
scrambled up the shaling cinders. The
door of a second-class carriage was open
to receive her and half -a dozen arms
thrust themselves out to help her in.
“That’s the style,” chuckled a little fat
man, shifting up to make room. “Home
and dry on the turtle’s back. You judged
things to a minute and made y’r run at
the. right time.”
“Wasn’t any hurry,” the lean, collar-
less man opposite said drily. “They’ll
stop here for hours, like they’ve stopped
at every tinpot station on the way down.”
The girl didn’t'speak. She sank back
against the padded seat, her eyes half-
closed, her mouth faintly open, breathing
uncertainly, as if she had just emerged
from some horrible strain. An odor of
ParmS - r violets and wet mackintosh
‘hovered about her crumpled figure. She
had a small-featured, fastidious face, pale
and transparent as the lining of a shell;
her eyebrows-were plucked, her mouth
rouged to a' subtle bow. Over her ears
the hair was drawn in two glossy, black
wings, and their shadows seemed to give
a tinge of purple to her drooping lids.
“Dulcie!” came a voice from outside
the carriage.' . - _ " . - -
A faint frown wrinkled the girl’s ala-
baster, forehead as she roused herself to
speak ~to- the woman who had come
clambering after ' her up the embank-
ment. They were still loading milk-cans
at the front of ttie train. From their
dugout the station-master and a porter
had emerged, and were handling the wet,
shining cylinders with obvious distaste.
In the mud-spattered sulky the driver, a
husky, heavy-limbed young fellow, was
looking up at the carriage with moist,
sentimental eyes. j
“It’s not going yet,” panted the
weather-beaten woman on the embank-
ment, gathering her man’s coat about her.
“We hadn’t ought to have been so flur-
ried. I was scared the creek’d. be worse
than it was with all this rain—that we
wouldn’t get across. And we didn’t seem
to have time for a word at the end. You
think a fortnight’s going to give you a
chance to do all the talking you want;
then it’s flashed by . afore you know it
But don’t worry about Uncle Dave. He’s
taken ,the right turn now.”
“I won’t worry,” said .the girl frigidly.
The woman shifted from one foot to
another, her tanned, homely face tilted
up toward the carriage, her bent arm
holding her shapeless figure together.
Occasionally her thin lips twitched as if
she were feeling for words, pathetically
anxious to pick up some thread of con-
tact.
“It was hard luck, him going down
like that. Just when you’d been looking
forward to a good holiday. He’s never
had a touch of anything before —out in
all weathers, yet strong as a horse. Then
the rain. It didn’t ought to rain so much
this time of year. Not in August. I
don’t know what we’d have done if it
hadn’t been for Alf. Helping with the
milking and coming over to drive you in.”
The girl’s slim figure stiffened beneath
the plum-colored raincoat.
“You’ve told him all that over and
over. Anyway it’s a break for him, liv-
ing by himself on that God-forgotten
selection.... Better not keep him wait-
ing now, Mother.” - ;
“No ; I’ll be getting along. Y’r things
weren’t. spoilt, Dulcie?”
“If they are, it can ? t be helped now.
Serve me right for wearing anything but
flourbags here.”
“Well, better luck next holiday, dear.
Good-bye.”
“Good-bye. . I’ll write soon as I get
back.” , ■ .'•■/•
The shrill whistle drowned her clipped
farewell and she dropped back into her
seat like a crab into dark depths while
the train droned off over the watery land-
scape. A curve of the line showed the
sulky rolling away. like a ball of mud
behind the drooping horse, its two
huddled figures merged into one, its out-
lines melting in mist.- Vaguely the girl’s
mind followed it. Eight miles out to the
farm, with , a flooded creek and a reedy
swamp to be crossed on the way. Then
the stop at the muddy cowyards, with
Alf driving off to his selection, while her
mother made her way up the oozy track
to where Uncle Dave was waiting in his
verandah room that still smelt of hot lin-
seed. •
Not till they had been rattling along
for half an hour could she get the picture
out of her mind. She sat in a coma,
sheathed in her plum-colored coat, star-
ing with purple-shadowed eyes at the
dripping trees, at the -line of luggage-
filled racks, at the. two bald heads that
described semicircles on the back of the
opposite seat, rolling about like melons
but never falling. ' Then gradually the
warmed air of the carriage brought some-
thing to life within, her. She pulled out
her compact and, locking carefully into
the fragment of glass, began to dab at
her. pearl-hued' face ; she replaced a
strand of black hair that had strayed from
the . wing over ..her left ear ; she lifted
the hem of her blue crepe de Chine and
began to scrub at some yellow spots with
her handkerchief.
“Been home for a holiday?” asked the
stout woman in the corner beside her,
opening niuddy,. sympathetic eyes.
The floodgates of Dulcie’s feeling be-
came suddenly unbarred.
“Home! I suppose that’s what you’d
call it—what I used to call it myself once.
I don’t care if I never see the place
again now, though. It’s always the same
whenever I go back. Mud up to your
ankles as soon as you step outside the
door, and someone or other sick so
they’re short-handed with the milking.
Wading up to your neck in wet grass get-
ting the cows in, or ploughing with
buckets through yards only fit for a pig.
Anyone who can stick that sort of life
can have it all on their own. It don’t
suit me.”
“You struck bad weather,” said the
stout woman. “It’s raining all down the
line.”
“When does it ever stop here?” re-
torted Dulcie. “If the sun comes out
two days running they’re scared there’s
going to be a drought. Yes, I suppose
it does stop sometimes. And the mud
turns to dust while you’re watching it,
like a fade-out on the screen. But they
always pretend you just happened to
strike the wrong sort of weather. Every-
thing in the garden would have been
lovely if you’d only come the week be-
fore. That doesn’t fool me, though. I
know what it is like to live in places
like these. If you can call it living.”
“You got out?”
“Well out. Three years ago, now.”
She was still dabbing at spots on the
blue crepe de Chine, stretching out her
silken legs to look at her muddied snake-
skin. shoes. But the vibration of feeling
in her mind was not wholly due to her
spoilt clothes. The echoes of her mother s
voice still reverberated in a secret part
of her, twitching at exposed nerves.
“I don’t know what we’d have done
if it hadn’t been for Alf.”
There was something in the suggestion
she. deeply resented. It was as if a faint,
steady pressure were being put upon her.
Not only her mother but- life itself was
in the conspiracy. Whenever she went
home there was some reason for calling
Alf in to help: last time it was fencing
damaged by floods, this time Uncle
Dave’s pneumonia. And Alf was always
ready to leave his work and come, fend-
ing off any thanks in his heavy, good-
humored way, finding little jobs that

“It’s like old times, having you back,
Dulcie.”
His slow eyes followed her with dog-
like affection, weaving a net of sentiment
around her, sapping at her resistance. The
worst of it was that she responded to
them while she was there, feeling soft
and mushy inside, a prey to scents and
reminders of her barefoot girlhood, the
hay-smell in the barn, the herby breath
of the draught horses at feeding-time.
There was her mother’s talk of having
a little farm of your own. There was Alf
with his slow movements, his soft, drawl-
ing voice going on and on, curling round
her, drawing her down to him.
And sometimes, as now, she had a
dream of being caught in a morass of
warm, suffocating mud, churned by the
feet of cows. It held her transfixed. She
couldn’t move ; even her will to move was
gone. The mud crept over her snakeskin
shoes, seeped round her silken ankles,
gradually sucked her down into elemental
depths. It was useless to cry out. There
was no one to hear in that mist-en-
shrouded wilderness. She was lost, buried
alive.
With a start she sat up, looking at the
swaying heads around her, the puffy faces
into which life and personality were be-
ginning to flow as the train reached
the outer suburbs, shrieking its shrill
triumph every minute or so.
“Well, that’s over,” she told herself,
reaching for her compact agaim “If I
go back next time I’ll deserve all I get.”
But she didn’t feel really safe till a
couple of hours later, when she had re-
turned to her own world of vicarious liv-
ing. In a silken frock, fragile as spun
glass, she stood at the head of the marble
stairway, waiting for the hum and chatter
that would tell of people arriving below.
There was a satisfying luxury in the
Doric columns that reached to the
moulded roof, in the tapestried hangings
of the corridors, in the heavy carpets that
let feet sink into them without sound.
Lights glowed dimly in curtained alcoves
behind their shades of patterned copper ;
the air was heavy and rich with aromatic
spices burning in unseen censers. Mov-
ing from the head of the stairway Dulcie
paused for a moment to survey herself
in the long, silver-rimmed glass that was
placed above one of the Moorish divans.
Perfect she knew herself to be now, puri-
fied from all the grossness of the other
world, a triumph of refined art from her
wavy coiffure to her crimson-tinted nails.
Over her shoulder, in the depths of the
glass, she could see a tall figure advanc-
ing toward her from the far corridor.
He was dressed in a uniform of azure
blue, with frogs and epaulettes of gilded
braid, and high boots that had the
crinkly softness of silk. There was mili-
tary dignity in his walk, but his cleft
chin and aristocratic features radiated a
soft and enervating charm under the
diffused light. His tonsure of dark hair
was glued to his skull; his moustache
was like a delicate crayon-mark on his
upper lip.
“Hullo, Dulcie,” he said lightly. “Just
come back to-night?”
The look she flashed at him from
beneath her curved lids was half-coquet-
tish, half-resentful.
“Wonder you noticed I’d ever been
away. Getting observant, aren’t you,
Jimmy?”
“Well, I was off myself a couple of
days,” he defended. “Neuralgia. Dead
to the w0r1d.... Have a good holiday?”

My Body Is My Only House.
My body is my only house, and anything that
spoils or maims
My house an insult is to me. It gives me
pain enough
Through folly of my ancestors > perversity of
mine;
Yet I rejoiced exceedingly that it was half so
fine.
Much pleasure has it given me: much joy in
lovely earth,
Through eyes, through ears, through skin,
through touch, through sense of every kind.
My body is my only house: it is no skin to
slough.
My body is my only house, and when my
tenancy
Is over I would send it back into infinity,
Asking its pardon for misuse, or all that spoils
or maims,
And loose it freely into light on eager, dancing
flames!

LLYWELYN LUCAS.
The Sport of Kings.
BY PHILIP MASEL.
US WF, Perth. We are now crossing
Q to the Goodwood racecourse
for a running commentary on the
last race. Stand by, please!”
tj.. * , . f y A ,
Elias Thistlewaite sat up expectantly
and fingered the knobs on the dial in an
attempt to secure louder reception. He
glanced at the little slip of paper in his
and. Swallow-Dive was his selection,
an outsider. Ten pounds on at, say, 10
to 1 a hundred pounds. It was worth
risking two weeks wages at Hoot s
Haberdashery Store with such a prize at
stake. A hundred pounds meant a five
weeks cruise in a luxurious 20,000-ton
liner,, with sufficient left over to pay a
deposit on the really good second-hand
car which Hobson across the road was
trying to sell him.
“Good afternoon, folks. We are now
at the Goodwood racecourse, and the
horses are just going to the barrier for
the last race”....
The familiar voice brought a smile of
excitement to Thistlewaite’s thin lips. His
narrow shoulders bunched forward, his
eyes concentrated on the polished wood
of the instrument as though he could see
reflected there the prancing thorough-
breds, the colors of the jockeys, the faces
of bookmakers and punters.
“They’re coming into line. They’re
off!”
If Elias Thistlewaite, five foot three,
nine stone and fifty years of age, bald and
bony, high-collared and bespectacled,
spending forty-four hours every week for
the last thirty-odd years in an atmosphere
of garter-elastic and ribbons, looked
neither a big punter nor a romantic
dreamer, it was because appearances are
deceptive. True he had never visited a
racecourse nor sneaked into an s.-p. shop,
Yet he was undoubtedly a gambler.
Every Saturday afternoon for three
years he had listened-in to descriptions of
the races, speculating on every event his
fiver or his tenner. Thistlewaite was his
own bookmaker. A little black notebook
contained the history of his transactions
—big losses sometimes, bigger wins on
fewer occasions. An outstanding entry
was the double he had picked for last
year’s Railway Stakes and Perth Cup ;
two outsiders had netted him £5OO. Every
shilling of that small fortune he had
s P ent (in his imagination) in a variety of
ways which had provided him with two
months of delightful dreaming.
Thistlewaite was a lonely man, a
bachelor, with a few acquaintances but
no friends. He had told nobody of his
queer hobby. He was afraid of being
laughed at. It scarcely became a fifty-
year-old shop-assistant to indulge in such
a pastime. But he was happy. He had
learnt to play the game so thoroughly
now that on Saturday afternoons he for-
got fi was a game, and experienced real
emotional reactions as alternating wins
an d losses were recorded over the ether,
Sometimes, on a Monday, his fellow-
assistants blamed Thistlewaite’s liver for
a certain unevenness of temper actually
due to a couple of horses running like
hairy goats on the previous Saturday,
And his wins were reflected in the smug
complacency with which he wound and
unwound ribbons, snapping the silk
between his fingers in the manner of a
teller with his banknotes,
“What a finish! Dandy Dick leads
into the straight but Swallow-Dive comes
on the outside with a great run.” One
could detect in the recordings of the
sensitive microphone the vibrant excite-
ment in the man’s voice. “But he can’t
quite get up. Dandy Dick wins by
a head, with Swallow-Dive second,
and”....
Thistlewaite relaxed in the armchair
and mopped his forehead. That was bad
luck, coming as it did on top of an un-
usually bad day. His notebook showed
that he was down £45 on the afternoon,
There were rules of the game to
which he rigidly adhered. All thoughts
of Noumea and motor-cars he dismissed
from his mind. In their stead was sub-
stituted resentment against the jockey
who had allowed his mount to trail too
far behind, against the trainer for not
having the horse in better trim, against
himself for having been such a fool as to
forget the obvious claims of Dandy Dick.
He crossed to the telephone, whose in-
sistent ringing now drowned the an-
nouncer’s comments,

Roboleine lias proved a real blessing to thous-
ands of anxious mothers who have seen their
ailing little ones brought back to vigorous
health by this magical tonic food. Roboleine
is not a “medicine.” It contains no drugs—
nothing but a concentration of Nature’s own most
valuable body-building foods, rich in vitamins.
Not only is Roboleine a complete food in itself
—in addition it causes the body to extract the
utmost nourishment from the ordinary diet. Read
what Roboleine contains. RED AND "WHITE
BONE MARROW to make good red blood.
CREAM OF MALT, a source of energy. EGG
YOLK, containing lecithin, the greatest
food known. LEMON JUICE for building bone.
"VITAD, a wonderful tasteless concentrate of cod
liver oil, the most powerful source of vitamins
A and D. If you do not know from experi-
ence what Roboleine can do for ailing children,
send the coupon for a sample. Three teaspoons-
ful a day (the proper ration for children) costs
less than 3d., surely little enough to pay for that
priceless blessing, perfect health.
Roboleine now costs only 4/6 per 12 oz.
jar or 12/- for 3 times the quantity,
at all Chemists.

“Yes, Mr. Hobson? Quite well,
thank y0u.... Go with you to the Perth
Cup next Saturday?.... I —l think I will
.... No, I’m not very interested in racing,
but I’ll come for the outing.... Awfully
good of you to think of me. Good-bye,
Mr. Hobson.”
'
! And so Thistlewaite went to the Cup
with Mr. and Mrs. Hobson. Hobson, of
course, was making a good fellow of
himself on account of the potential sale
of his car, little knowing that Thistle-
waite’s interest in the vehicle was one
further link in the strange chain of self-
deception that now imprisoned all his
j leisure thoughts. Thistlewaite, for his
j part, admitted to himself on the way out
I that he had been caught off his balance.
What right had he to start going to the
races? Besides, he couldn’t afford to bet,
what with the insurance premiums and
the payments on his wireless. The
afternoon might easily result in an expen-
diture out of all proportion to his finan-
cial status.
So he found himself going halves with
Mrs. Hobson in one ss. place-tote ticket
on each race. At first the novelty of
betting with real money enthralled him,
and the collection of a 7s. dividend when
a hot favorite ran second engendered a
i thrill. But gradually the reaction set
in. He was conscious of a feeling of
I contempt for himself, of treachery to
those engrossing hours with his wireless.
; The spectacle of big money changing
; hands in the ring where he had wan-
dered prior to the last race made him
more than ever aware of the pettiness of
his afternoon’s indulgence. And so his
blood stirred within him.
He looked at his racebook. Mrs. Hob-
son and he had taken a ticket on
j Wyworri, principally because the
feminine instinct had been attracted to
its owner’s colors.
Thistlewaite read the entry against
Beau Geste’s name. For some time the
gelding had been running badly, but
Thistlewaite had noted that the track
reports had been curiously non-commit-
tal. Instinct warned him that the stable
a stable-mate had won.
Leaving the Hobsons, he made his way
to the tote and bought a ss. straightout
ticket on Beau Geste. He strolled back
to the ring in time to see a stout man
address a bookmaker.
“What price Beau Geste?” in a low
voice.
“Twelves! ”
Thistlewaite’s eyes gleamed as the cor-
pulent one handed over two ten-pound
I notes. He gazed in silent admiration at
the punter, mentally noting his opulent-
looking cigar.
And now Thistlewaite was back in the
grandstand with the Hobsons. The race
was on. All day he had experienced diffi-
culty in distinguishing the horses, and it
was not until the leaders were flashing
past the winning post that he realised
that Beau Geste had won.
“Wyworri second-last!” said Mrs.
Hobson disgustedly.
“Beau Geste will pay a good price,”
said her husband. “Wish I’d been given
the oil about him.”
“I had a straightout ticket on him,”
confessed Thistlewaite.
“Gracious, you might have told your
friends about him!” retorted Mrs. Hob-
son, obviously annoyed.
“Oh, I didn’t know anything,” ex-
plained Thistlewaite, ashamed of his
duplicity. “I selected him at random.
Really, I know nothing at all about race-
horses.”
“O.K. Mugs for luck!” said Hobson.
“Run along and collect your money and
meet us under that plane-tree.”
Beau Geste paid £3 55., and a very
pleased Thistlewaite hurried back to his
friends.
“You’ve had a good day,” commented
Hobson. “Care to come out again next
Saturday?”
Thistlewaite was on the point of accept-
ing the invitation. By the time he had
paid his expenses and deducted his losses
he was winning a couple of pounds. Not
much, certainly, to a big-game hunter, but
a handy addition to his salary. And
then he spotted the corpulent punter,
cigar at a rakish angle, betting ticket
extended towards the bookmaker. Out
of the latter’s bag came twenty crisp
tenners and twelve fivers.
“Thanks all the same,” said Thistle-
waite, “but I’m not very keen on the
races. You don’t mind, do you?”
Next Saturday Thistlewaite heard the
Hobsons driving off. %
He smiled indulgently, selected an enor-
mous cigar from the box he had pur-
chased with his winnings, and sat down
in his armchair.
“6WF Perth. We are now crossing to
headquarters for a running commentary
on the first race. Stand by, please!”
“Thirty on Dreamer,” whispered Thistle-
waite to himself. “Should start at eights. ’
Noumea and Hobson’s car dangled
between his eyes and the radio. He sat
up expectantly, puffing nervously at his
cigar....
Hobson’s way, racing was the sport of
shop-assistants ; his way, it was the Sport
of Kings.
Momentum.
BY HERBERT BERNICE.
AMELIA took a circuitous route to
the station. She had left her bed-
sitting-room early, glad to be out
in the sunshine. The weather was usually
either too hot or too cold, too windy or
breathlessly calm ; as variable as human
nature, with the exception that the latter
never approached perfection.
She chose a direction little known to
her, and, with face fixed straight ahead,
allowed her eyes to rove critically. She
sniffed at the presence of a dowdy
female in an expensive home ; and the
tip of her nose rose a little higher at the
sight of a well-dressed person in a shabby
house.
Her glance seemed to penetrate any
mere man as though the space he occu-
pied were unadulterated atmosphere.
Nevertheless the tranquil day slightly
softened her usual austerity, and the
corners of her mouth seemed to be
twitching into an unaccustomed smile at
a baby eyeing her in wonderment from
an adjacent verandah, when a harsh
voice exclaimed:
“Oh, Lord, what a face!”
Experience had taught the futility of
arguing with the possessor of such a
voice ; so she hastened towards the
station, forcing the lower portion of her
long skirt into a kind of emotional dis-
order that matched the tumult within her.
Although few people were awaiting the
train, when it arrived she jostled into a
carriage, pushing aside a burly man in
the act of entering. He took his pipe
from his mouth and stared at her wide-
eyed.
To her disgust it was a smoking com-
partment mainly occupied by workmen.
Choosing a seat by a window she pulled
her skirts about her to avoid contact
should anybody sit near, and opened the
window.
The. burly man entered leisurely and,
glancing around, reluctantly sat beside
her. With a sidelong glance he removed
his pipe ; but, recalling her unceremo-
nious entry and the comparatively few
passengers in the non-smoking carriages,
he replaced and lighted it. The volumes
of smoke drifted towards the open win-
dow and Amelia coughed irritably. He
puffed harder still.
“Brought up in a pigsty!” she mut-
tered.
“Beg pardon, missus; were you talkin’
to me?” he asked.
“Don’t call me missus!”
“Gawd, no! I oughter known better.”
As the train drew into the next station
Amelia, who was by now in a furious
rage, rose to go.
“Disgusting brute!” she hissed as she
passed through the door. “I insulted the
pigs by suggesting that you were brought
up with them.”
The object of her attack became aware
that he was the centre of many amused
glances. His eyes wandered and came to
rest on a young man opposite.
“What the ’ell’s wrong with yer!” he
demanded.
The young man turned pale.
“I was —n’t laughing—at you,” he
stammered.
“I’ll make yer laugh the other side yer
face if yer give me any backslack.”
Public attention was now focussed
upon the young man. His mirth had
been mainly caused by the attitude of the
sour old maid, but this big galoot hadn’t
the sense to understand. He felt miser-
ably small and, being unlike a snail with
a shell in which to retire, became defiant.
“Have a try!” he challenged, “and
see what’ll happen.”
His enemy looked at him and half-rose
from his seat with one hand clenched.
“Get outer me sight or I’ll ’it yer,” he
said savagely.
The other, realising that he meant it,
discreetly retired to the outside platform
of the carriage, deeply conscious of the
eyes that followed his ignominious re-
treat.

UUNE !
"How can I fight film
and save my teeth?"
'T'HE story of a lost tooth is brief.
Film attacks. The tooth resists.
New film forms constantly. In it are
living germs which cause decay—yes,
millions of them. Day by day this
invisible war goes on until at last film
wins. And one more tooth is lost.
What is film ? Film is ever present
—on every tooth—constantly accumu-
lating. Sometimes it is invisible—more
often it forms a yellow, ugly mask.
Film is soft and sticky. Food parti-
cles cling to it. The mineral salts in
saliva combine with it to form hard,
irritating tartar. This causes gums
to bleed and lays them open to infection.
But film’s greatest damage is done
through tooth decay. In film are tiny,
rod-shaped germs . . . Lactobacilli.
These germs throw off enzymes which,
in turn, produce strong acid. This acid
eats away tooth enamel just as other
acids burn holes in cloth or wood.
Deeper and deeper goes the acid. Bigger
and bigger grows the cavity. Finally
the nerve is reached . . . the root canal
infected . . . and unless repaired in
time, results may well prove tragic.
“ What can I do to fight decay ?”
Remember: a clean tooth never decays.
To keep teeth free from film use Pepso-
dent instead of ordinary tooth pastes.
Why ? Because Pepsodent contains a
special film-removing substance.
This film-removing material in
Pepsodent is one of the great discov-
eries of the day. Its power to remov®
every trace of film-stain is revolution-
ary ! Its notable distinction of being
twice as soft as other materials in com-
mon use has gained wide recognition.
And so, when tempted to try cheap
and ineffective tooth pastes, remember
the one safe way to fight film is to use
the special film-removing tooth paste
—Pepsodent. Use it twice a day and
see your dentist at least twice a year.

The rush of air gradually dispelled his
clammy feeling. He wished that those
in the carriage could know of the re-
straint he had exercised. Nothing would
have pleased him better than to have
“hopped in” and taught that chap a les-
son, but when one was going to an im-
portant dance that evening the risk of
disfigurement simply had to be avoided.
He craved for a smoke, but had no
tobacco; so the moment the train
slowed down at his destination he rushed
out to get some. Then he remembered
bitterly that his action might have been
misjudged.
When well away from the station he
stopped and thought of returning. But
probably his aggressor would have slunk
away by now. Then he saw the burly
man just behind. There was no time to
dally now ; he would be late at the office.
He hurried on to his tobacconist.
The assistant finished dabbing powder
on her face before coming forward to
attend to him, and then misunderstood
his muttered order.
“I said cigarette tobacco,” he snapped,
still resentful over his railway-carriage
experience. “Why not attend to business
instead of dolling yourself up?”
"'How nice of you!” she replied. “Just
the way a gentleman would talk to a
young lady.”
"Young lady! Ha! ha! You’ve a
queer idea of age,” he sneered.
There had been a pretty flapper in
this shop; and she had always greeted
hjm with smiles. He had usually got
his supplies during lunch hour ; it allowed
him time for a mild flirtation. This girl
must be well past thirty. And she had the
audacity to call herself young!
“If the place doesn’t suit go elsewhere,”
she snapped, returning the tobacco to the
shelf.
“I certainly will,” and he stamped out
angrily.
“What’s the great idea, Miss Fax?” de-
manded her employer, coming into the
shop. “I heard you tell that young man
to go elsewhere.”
“I did, and will do so to anybody so
insulting,” she returned sharply.
“He’s been dealing here for months.
I employ you to sell, not to argue ; if
you can’t be pleasant to customers some-
thing is going to happen.”
His unfairness rankled. Customers
were the only people to whom he was
civil; his fixed smile vanished as they left.
tier temper was not improved by his
critical gaze from the office each time
anybody entered ; and he, struggling with
figures and income-tax returns, grumbled
his hatred of all women and Miss Fax in
particular.
A rush of customers brought him out.
When they had left he said:
“If you’re going to sulk you can take
a week’s notice.”
“I would prefer to go now,” she
snapped.
“Better still,” he said.
Continual callers kept him from his
books, and it was after two o’clock be-
fore he found an opportunity to begin
eating his lunch in the back office. He
pondered on the vagaries of women. The
business wouldn’t stand a male assistant;
besides, most men preferred buying from
an attractive girl. He had had enough
of the flapper type ; they would stand
ogling boys and neglect others. Now the
older ones wanted to run the business —
or ruin it.
Another customer. He swallowed hur-
riedly ; composed his features, and went
into the shop.
“Want any studs or tiepins, writin’
pads, envelopes”-; and the caller pro-
ceeded to open his case upon the counter.
“No! ”
“All right, mate, yer needn’t bite me
’ead orf,” said the hawker.
“I haven’t time to waste on your sort.”
“Oh, ’aven’t yer? I’m tryin’ to earn
a crust the same way as you: sellin’
things to people.”
“Get out!” was the reply. “You make
the place look untidy.”
“Come round ’ere and I’ll make you
look untidy,” said the other angrily.
The tobacconist was perturbed at the
threatening glint in the hawker’s eyes.
He went to the telephone.
“Yer might find a policeman in the
street; why don’t yer come round?”
jeered the hawker. Then, remembering
the police would certainly blame him he
grabbed his case and left.
y as enough to make a man turn
Bolshie, the hawker pondered. No jobs
about, and when you tried to earn an
honest penny people shut the door in
your face or snarled at you like that par-
ticular kind of cow did. There was some-
thing wrong with the world. Nearly
everybody had two faces: one they put
on when selling; the other, when asked
to buy.
With lagging steps he glanced into a
mg shop. Sellers too, only different in
degree. Anyhow he wasn’t cut out for
the game; put him behind a pick or
shovel and he’d hold his own with the
best.
Working for a Dago, too! Of course
a Dago couldn’t help being a Dago, but
it was hard lines when a dinkum Aussie
had to do that or nothing. He would re-
turn his stock and chance his luck again.
He had found it hard to raise the cash
for the outfit, but when he sold it back
he would have a few bob to go on with.
Entering a shop in a poor locality he
threw his case on the counter.
“Finished!” he said. “Full up of it!
Let’s ’ave me money for the stock!”
“No, no! I sella t’ you,” said the shop-
keeper with an expressive shrug.
“Cut that out!” demanded the erst-
while hawker. “Give me the money!”
The shopkeeper protested that it was
an outright sale ; the other insisted that
the goods were returnable. Both grew
heated.
“You leava da shop! Get out!”
ordered the proprietor.
“That’s done it! I’m not takin’ that
from a Dago. Give me the money or
I’ll crack yer!” ahd he advanced
threateningly.
“You calla me da Dago!” demanded
the proprietor.
“Yes, an’ cop that!” said the other.
In a moment they had clinched. The
proprietor went down. Frightened faces
appeared in the doorway. The shop-
keeper rose and rushed at his opponent;
a knife flashed; the hawker clutched at
his breast. He staggered a moment un-
certainly ; attempted to rush in again;
fell to the floor.
The shopkeeper sat on the bench in his
cell, his large brown eyes staring vacantly.
The policeman had just told him, with
rough compassion :
“Hard luck, Tony! He’s gone west.”
And now he would have to stand his
trial for murder; far away from his
homeland; amongst people that could
not understand and would riot tolerate
the hot, uncontrollable impulses that
dominated his race.
During the morning the ideal weather
had recalled his Mediterranean home ; he
would never see it again now. What evil
influence had led to such a culmination?
He shook his head in bewilderment.
How was he to know that the wave of
anger which had passed on and on and
in its course thrust aside all finer feel-
ings until its force was spent, leaving him
high and dry in the land of despair, had
been so innocently set in motion!
The cockatoo was being put away for
the night in the street along which
Amelia had walked.
“Scratch cocky! Scratch cocky!”
Then with a humorous twinkle in its eyes
it looked at its owner and shrieked: “Oh
Lord, what a face!”
The Brolgas’ Dance.
Down by the water weeds,
Hidden away,
I watched the brolgas
Dance to-day,
With a stately pacing
Of dun-grey shoon,
Down by the sunlit
Pool at noon,
Where the gum-trees shelter
The blue lagoon.
I watched them dance
As the brolgas can,
Away from the homes
And haunts of man ;
While the wild bees hummed them
A dancing tune
To the muted notes
Of a watery croon.
And the horse-flies skimmed
On the still lagoon.
With wings outstretched
To their satiny tips,
They bowed to each other
With courtly dips;
Then broke away
To come face to face
In a perfect foursome
Of feathered grace,
While the wild duck drummed them
A measured pace.
And I wondered then
In my hiding there
Why Nature decreed
That a sight so fair
Should be hidden from mortal
Eye to see,
For I knew the dancers
Would turn and flee
If they caught but the sight
Or the sound of me.
And I wondered, too,
If the gins were right
In a tale they told
On a far-off night,
By the lights of a campfire
Flickering low,
Where the grey shapes come
And the grey shapes go;
A tale they told
In a whispered breath:
That the brolgas’ dance
Was the Dance of Death.

All Due Respect.
BY P. A. DARBY SHIRE.
££ A N’ she calls that a fun’ral,”
I\ sneered Mrs. Spiffer.
“lt’s one o’ Frolic’s,” volun-
teered her neighbor, Mrs. Balmer, also
staring at No. 24. “Twelve pound ten
with one mournin’ coach, an’ fifteen with
two. Ain’t it terrible?”
As if uneasy under the lash of this criti-
cism one of the two rusty-black horses
in Mr. Frolic’s dilapidated hearse shifted
its weight on to its near side and sagged
even more noticeably than before.
“If that’s all she thinks of Joe Gud-
geon, as good a man as ever stepped in
shoe leather,” said Mrs. Spiffer, “then I’m
not goin’, that’s all. She’s got no respec
for the dead.”
“None at all,” agreed Mrs. Balmer, not
shifting her gaze from No. 24 in case she
missed something.
She had not far to look. It was a
short, narrow street in an unsavory part
of the city. The houses were crowded
close to the footpath and to each other
as if they were afraid to be alone in
such a quarter.
“Now when I lorst Spiffer,” said his
widow, “I give ’im a proper send orf.
Thirty-five quid it corst me —on the t.-p.,
but it was worth ev’ry penny. M’ogany
corffin, an’ ’andles an’ wotnots reel oxo’d
silver. None o’ that electric-plated silver
fer itic
“Nobody sees it,” said Mrs. Balmer,
bridling. Her lord’s “ ’andles an’ wotnots”
had been of the despised metal, and Mrs.
Spiffer knew it.
“It’s the thought uv it” Mrs. Spiffer
assumed a pained expression. “I couldn’t
bear it.” .
“Well, she’s got no need t’ scrimp,
said her neighbor. “They tell me wot
with the lodge an’ so on she’s bin allowed
somethink like forty quid. And wots
it corstin’ ’er? Not the arf uv it!’
“She’s got no respec’ for the departed.
And if she’s got none ’ow can she expec’
us to ’ave any?” Mrs. Spiffer folded her
arms resolutely. “I’m not goin’.”
The sound of vigorous knocking issued
from the home of the late Gudgeon.
Presently resourceful henchmen of the
farcically named Mr. Frolic put the coffin
through the window and bore it solemnly
to the hearse.
The widow and sundry relatives, all
garbed in black, entered the shabby
mourning coaches, and the driver of the
hearse clucked to his two quadrupeds,
which moved slowly off, achieving even-
tually a shambling trot.
The widow kept her head bent at the
correct angle, but it was obvious that her
sharp eyes were taking in the effect of
the funeral train on her neighbors.
“Oughta be ashamed uv ’erself,” Mrs.
Spiffer hissed.
“Got no respec’ fer the dead,” snapped
the other lady. “An’ poor Joe Gudgeon!
There was a model ’usband, if y’ like.
Took all ’ees wages, except a dollar a
week fer beer and t’bacca", and never a
squeak from ’im. An’ this is ’ees reward!”
“If she don’t think no more of ’im
than to ’ave ’im put away in sich a
fashion then I’m not goin’ to the fun’ral,”
declared Mrs. Spiffer. “I did ’ave it in
mind t’ catch the two-forty, but now I
wouldn’t think o’ sich a thing.”
Apparently most of East-street was of
the same opinion, for almost all its in-
habitants were leaning on their fences.
“If there’s ’arf a dozen at the grave-
side, I’ll be s’prised,” declared Mrs. Spif-
fer with a sniff. “An’ serve ’er right!”
“Might teach ’er what people’s
thinkin’,” snapped her friend.
At this moment Mrs. Cubitt came out
of No. 38, attired, obviously hastily, in
her Sunday best. She had a word or
two with Mrs. Sharp of No. 36 which
caused that lady to hurry indoors. A few
more words with Mrs. Trickett of No. 34
made her do the same. Other people on
the opposite side of the street followed
their example. , , , J
Mrs. Spiffer and Mrs. Balmer looked at
each other in amazement.
“’Ave you ’eard the noos?’ asked
Mrs. Cubitt, panting with excitement.
“The lodge ’nd the insurance people
allowed Mrs. Gudgeon twenty quid
apiece fer the fun’ral, and she decided
that instid o’ doin’ it all in on a farncy
fun’ral she’d keep the arf of it fer a
fun’ral tea.”
“A wot 1”
“Don’t quite git it meself,” confessed
Mrs. Cubitt, impatient to be off, but
unable to resist imparting her astounding
news. “But she wants all those at the
graveside t’ go to ’er ’ouse afterwards fer
ft Sort uv a wake after the burial, /
take it There’s a nine-gallon keg o’
beer turkey, savs., trotters, ’am an’ plates
an’ plates o’ sangwidges.” She smacked
her lies and then became somewhat im-
portant. “O’ course, it’s only fer them
wot’s at th’ graveside, like I said. She s
goin’ to ask ’em personal.”
Mrs. Cubitt rushed away, fearful of
missing the two-forty, leaving two thun-
derstruck women staring after her.
“It’s show, that’s wot it is,” snapped
Mrs. Spiffer. “list a bit o’ flashness.
Mrs. Balmer stirred uncomfortably.
“O’ course, when y’ come t’ think uv
it, it don’t show much respec’ ter Joe not
ter go, does it?” she asked.
“Not if yer put it that way,” said Mrs.
Spiffer. “After all, it ain’t ’er we’re got
t’ think of —it’s 7m.” .
Mrs. Balmer looked thoughtfully in
the direction in which the funeral had
gone. She saw, not a row of ugly cot-
tages, but slices of cold turkey, strings of
steaming saveloys, mound upon mound
of sandwiches. And her ears plainly
heard the musical gurgling of beer run-
ning out of a spigot.
“Perhaps it might be better t’ go, after
all,” she said virtuously. “It wouldn’t
look right not ter.”
She received no reply. Turning her
head, she saw her neighbor disappearing
indoors.
She wrenched herself off the pickets
and did the same.
Mountain Magic.
I have seen them in my childhood, with the
breaking day around them,
In its mystery and shadow, till the sun broke
through the grey;
I have known them at the noonday when the
blue came up and crowned them;
And the mystery abided when my childhood
stole away.
Love and hate may pass and perish with the
passion hues they wore;
But the magic of the mountains shall endure
for evermore.
I have seen the tempest sweeping in its anger
on the ranges,
When the mountain streams were torrents,
where the white foam swirled and spun;
I have known the lights and shadows, and the
rapid storms and changes;
Seen the glad streams laugh and brighten in
the pathway of the sun;
I have known their peaks and loved them from
the first fierce summer glow
Till the drifting of the grey clouds and the
falling of the snow.
When the day of life is closing, take me back,
O Gracious Giver,
To the misty gold of dawning, to the Dwell-
ing of the Free!
Let me know the joy of living, ere I fall asleep
for ever,
Where the grey hills drowse at twilight to
the music of the sea;
Then, ah! then, the tranquil slumber that no
longing ever mars,
And the voice of distant waters and the quiet
of the stars!

NELLIE A. EVANS.
Above the Jamieson.
In cloudless skies, behind the range,
The summer sun sinks low,
While o’er the sunken valley-floor
Cliff-faces, radiant, glow.
Sunlit they glow, as though they see
Some glory, strange and new,
Unseen before, undreamt before,
That they alone may view.
Amaze they show, all joy they show;
Like seers rapt they seem —
Vouchsafed some vision magical,
Some miracle supreme.
A moment’s space thus, thus they glow,
And then, that moment done,
The high, inspiring light they knew
Fades with the sunken sun.
Grey, grey they grow as twilight falls
Upon the valley wide.
Upon its inland headlands all —
Its coast that knows no tide.
While cliff and cape along that coast
Remote and rugged rise,
The stirless air becomes the haunt
Of lonesome homing cries.
A thrush gives out his farewell song,
And secret waters sing,
Like pilgrims far from home and hearth,
Of too much wandering.
In twos and threes from ridge to ridge
Black mountain magpies fly;
In twos and threes from bush and tree —
“Come home! Come home!” they cry.
Where winds the hidden Jamieson,
Cliff-walled, tall trees beneath,
Upon its ancient pilgrimage,
Mists gather —wreath on wreath.
From grove and glade, where gladsome folk,
Companioned by great gums,
Kept holiday, the long day through,
No sound of laughter comes.
Home, home this hour and more they’ve gone,
Way weary and footsore;
Their frolics done, their feasting done,
Their day of joyance o’er.
Home, home they’ve gone like other folk —
Folk w_orn by time and woe,
Who now no more throw care aside,
To holidaying go.
From dying fires smoke-wreaths uprise,
And lingering among
Green leafage, hint of roving days
When all the world was young.
As though they voice grey twilight’s mood,
What time they straggling fly
O’er deep and height—“ Come home! Come
home,”
The mountain magpies cry.

A Practical Course for
Practical Men and Women
PELMANISM is concerned with personal attributes and quali-
ties which are fundamental. They may be sleeping or only
partly developed, but they are in every normal individual.
Pelmanism develops them, separately and together, so that amongst
other things concentration is made easier by quickened perceptions ;
natural energy enormously increased by interest, and prompt
decision justified by soundness of judgment.
Amongst these attributes and qualities are:
Concentration
Judgment
Decision
Will-Power
Initiative
Self-Confidence
Presence of Mind
Organising Power
Cheerfulness
And a Reliable Memory.
The development of these strong, positive, vital qualities contributes
to one’s earning capacity, and makes it possible to live intelligently
in the present and build strongly for the future.
The People Who Take the
Pelman Course
There is only one kind of man who takes the Pelman Course,
but he is found in every calling and in every walk of life. He is
the man who wants to excel, who will not be deterred by circum-
stances, who will live intelligently and strongly, the man who will
reach out and take the good things that every age and every
occupation offer to him who has the wit and courage to take them.
AN ACCOUNTANT states that Pel-
manism has shown him “how to
overcome that paralysing feeling
of inferiority.”
A SHOP ASSISTANT reports that
he has secured a better position,
and attributes this to Pelmanism.
A FARM-WORKER writes: “Thanks
to Pelmanism, I am feeling more
confident and more alive.”
A MANAGER reports an increase
in Self-confidence, “which has
brought me the respect of my
colleagues.”
AN ENGINEER writes: “I feel
especially an increase in Self-confi-
dence, which gives professional
status.”
A CLERK writes that he has im-
proved in memory, concentration
and will-power, and that his mind
is quicker and more alert.
A WOMAN CLERK writes: “I can.
concentrate for quite a long period
without my mind wandering. I
observe things far more quickly,
and have ever so much more confi-
dence in myself and my abilities.”
A TEACHER writes: “This Course
has had a remarkable effect on my
physical and mental health. What
pleases me most is the certainty
that I have lost my fear. My
Self-confidence has returned, and
my whole outlook on life seems
to be reconstructed.”
A BANK CLERK writes: “This
Course has enabled me to see
clearly what I want in life and
how to get it. It has taken me out
of the rut.”
Thousands of similar letters from all
over Australia and New Zealand
could be printed did space permit.
“pELMANISM,”
says Dame
Sybil Thorndike,
“gives mind-exercise
scientifically. It not
only improves, but
actually discovers,
Qualities that would
otherwise have re-
ma i ned dormant.
Pelinanism gives a
mental clarity and
alertness that sees
opportunities and
uses them rightly.”
**r
Dame byoil 'A'noriuuke.
Lortl Kiildell
“Pelmanism,” says
Lord Riddell, “Is
rapidly becoming
part and parcel of
our daily lives.”
Lord Riddell did
splendid work for
England at the
Peace Conference.
His War Diary ex-
cited great interest.
“Pelmanism,” Dr.
Norwood, of tlie
City Temple, Lon-
don, says, ‘‘is sound
Psychology and an
admirable system of
Mind-training. Pel-
manism teaches that
man has the key to
his own career and
enables ruany to
find the key itself
which, for want of
self-knowledge, had
lain undiscovered.”
