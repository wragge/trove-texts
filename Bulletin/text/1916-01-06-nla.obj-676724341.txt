Cynical Verse
The Father.
That was his sort.
It didn’t matter
What ice'were at
But he must chatter
Of this and that
His little son
Had said or done;
Till, as he told
The fiftieth time
Without a change
How three-year-old
Prattled a rime,
They got the range
And, cut him short.
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.
The Devil’s Bag.
I saw the Devil walking down the lane
Behind our house. There was a heavy hag
Strapped tightly on his shoulders, and tilt
rain
Sizzled when it hit him. He picked a rag
Up from the ground and put it in his sack
And grinned and rubbed his hands.
There was a thing
Moving inside the bag upon his back —
It must have been a soul! I saw it fling
And twist about inside, and not a hole
Or cranny for escape! Oh, it was sud!
I cried and shouted out: “Let out that soul",
But he turned round, and, sure, his face
went mad,
And twisted up and down, and lie said
“Hell!’’
And ran away... .Oh, mammy! I’m not
well.
.Tames Stephens.
His Mate.
“ Hi-diddle-diddle,
The cat and the fiddle"....
I raised my head,
And saw him seated, on a heap of dead,
Yelling tlie nursery-tune,
Grimacing at the m00n....
The little dog laughed to sec such sport,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.”
And, as he stopped to snigger,
, struggled to my knees and pulled th
trigger.
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.
Limitations.
Your, eye was briaht,
Your finger shook
As you to-night
My fingers took.
The street is cold,
Ah, grief that I
Can’t catch a gold
Star from the sky.
So great a whirl
My little girl,
It may not be.
If God above
Had understood,
And made, you, love,
Not quite so good.
Henry Baerlein.
The Quiet.
I could not understand the sudden quiet —-
The sudden darkness —in the crash of
fight,
The din and glare of day quenched in a
twinkling.
In utter starless night.
I lay an age and idly gazed at nothing,
Half-puzzled that I could not lift my head;
And then I knew somehow that I was lying
Among the other dead.
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.
The Inquest.
I took my oath I loould enquire,
Without affection, hate or wrath,
Into the death of Ada Wright —
So help me God! I took that oath.
When I went out to see the corpse,
The four-months babe that died so young,
I judged it ivas seven pounds in weight,
And little more than one foot long.
One eye, that had a yellow lid,
Was shut —so was the mouth, that smiled;
The left eye open, shining bright —
It seemed a knowing little child.
v For as I looked at that one eye,
It seemed to laugh, and say with glee:
“What caused my death you’ll never know —
Perhaps my mother murdered me.”
When I went into court again,
To hear the mother's evidence —
It was a love-child, she explained,
And smiled, for our intelligence.
"Now, gentlemen of the jury,” said
The coroner. “This woman's child
By misadventure met its death."
"Aye, aye," said we. The mother smiled.
And I could see that child’s one eye,
Which seemed to laugh, and say with glee:
11 What caused my death you’ll never know—
Perhaps my mother murdered me."
W. H. Davies, in The English Rfatew.
The Joke.
He’d even have his joke
While we were sitting tight,
And so he needs must poke
His silly head in sight
To whisper some new jest,
Chortling, but as he snoke
A rifle cracked ....
And now God knows when I shall hear the
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.
Behind the hill.
Behind the hill I met a man in green
Who asked me if my mother had gone out?
I said she had. He asked me had I seen
His castle, where the people sing and shout
From dawn to dark, and told me that he had
-4 crock of gold inside a holloio tree,
And I could have it.—l wanted money had
To buy a sivord with, and I thought that
he
Would keep his solemn word; so, off we
went.
He said he had a pound hid in the crock,
And owned the castle too, and paid no rent
To any one, and that you had to knock
Five hundred /imcs. I asked, “Who reck-
oned up?”
And he said, “You insulting'little pup!”
James Stephens.
In the Ambulance.
“Two rows of cabbages,
Two of curly-grccns,
Two roios of early peas,
Ttoo of kidney-beans.”
That's what he is muttering,
.1/ aking such a song,
Keeping other chaps awake,
s The whole night long.
Both his legs are shot away,
And his head is light;
.So he keeps on muttering
All the blessed night.
“Two rows of cabbages,
Two of curly-greens,
Two rows of early peas,
Two of kidney-beans.”
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.
Very French.
Tell me, can you remember still
That afternoon along the Seine,
Or is it better that our dreams
Of youth should not come back again?
We pondered on the universe,
So far as it affected us.
And oh! that future wedding-day
Seemed to be too miraculous.
Yon said a certain destiny
That watches over certain lives
Had brought one. husband out of space —
To meet, said I, the best of wives.
I told you that no star is born
Without another kindred star —
I cannot tell you this to-day
Because 1 know not where you are. ...
And so, my child, toe reached the shop
Where ornamental birds are sold,
Green parrots, blue birds from Japan,
Canaries with a shirt of gold.
Your eyes shone for the Japanese
And they were more dismayed than you
When he, the master of the shop,
Thrust in his arm to capture two.
The cage was low and he so fall
He could not see to save his life,.
And thus he blindly groped about
To catch a husband and a wife.
' Henry Baerlein.
His Father.
I quite, forgot to put the spigot in.
It's just come over me.. . .and it is queer
To think he'll not care if we lose or tvir.,
And yet be jumping mad about the beer.
I left it running full. He must have said
A thing or two. I'd give my stripes to hear
What he will say if I’m reported dead
Before he gets me, told about that beer!
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson.
No doubt, the war is responsible for this
cynical outbreak among the poets. They
can’t go on turning out heroics any longef:
the thing is getting too serious. So they find
relief in cynicism and almost hysterical cheek.
It is the tame poet’s only way of relieving
his feelings, though Rupert Brooke found a
better way. But, then, he wasn’t tame.
Henry Baerlein, author of Windrush and
Evenlode (Methuen), has done more import-
ant work as the translator of The Diwan of
Abu’l Ala, a remarkable rival of Omar. His
verses are delightfully brief and equally
casual.
James Stephens, author of The Adventures
of Seumas Beg (McMillan, per Dymock’s
Library), has another excuse for his ribald
humor: he is Irish. And in such delightful
prose works as The Crock of Gold and The
Charwoman's Daughter, he has given us
generously of his Irishry. These child poems
are full of whimsical charm, though some of
them are too slight to have been worth the
trouble. But how cunningly he achieves the
child’s delightful literalness and its daring
naiveness of belief in fairies.
Of W. H. Davies all that need be said
is that this sort of thing is expected of him.
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson is rapidty piling up
a poetic achievement. Of h-is earlier work,
Daily Bread and Fires (both published by
Elkin Mathews at 2s. 6d.), this page has
already given samples and its high apprecia-
tion. But in Battle (same publisher and
price) the poet has found the one subject
for which his genius has unconsciously been
seeking. These poems of the trenches
are dreadfully true; and the psychology of
the Tommy has never before been expressed
with such poignancy nor with such a mas-
terly economy of language. The few ex-
cerpts given above represent the quality that
runs evenly through the whole book. Battle
is the real thing in war verse.
The War
“Suppose a soul,” asks tlie U.S. novelist
Owen Wistfr, in The Pentecost of Calamity
(Macmillan, 25.)., “arrived on earth from
another world, wholly ignorant of earth....
were given its choice after a survey of the
nations, which it should be born in and be-
long to? In May, June and July, 1914, my
choice would have been, not France, not
England, not America, but Germany.” For
Owen Wister knew and loved the
Germans —at peace. Everywhere he went
in Germany he noted the contentment
of the German face. That, to him,
was the surest sign that a Govern-
ment was agreeing with its people. His
memory recalls a pleasant picture: “The
fair aspect and order of the country and
the cities, the well-being of the people, their
contented faces, their grave adequacy, their
kindliness... .their feeling for beauty as
shown in their gardens.... the reverent
value for their great native poets and
musicians.” And yet this was the, country
whose school-children celebrated by a festival
the sinking of the Lusitania.
Owen Wister knows the Vermin now.
“Had it not culminated before our _eyes, the
case of Germany would be perfectly incred-
ible. As it stands to-day the truly incred-
ible thing is that she should have made her
spring at the throat of an unexpecting,
unprepared world.” In those days we were
all Owen Wisters, seeing in Verminy just
what the Vermin meant us to see. But
Owen Wister’s most damning indictment is
contained in the words of the Vermin them-
selves. From their reported speeches and f
their writings he has compiled a Vermin
creed that sounds to the rest of the -world
like a creed of devils.'
lie asks whether Verminy can be restored
to sanity,, but sees no sign. “Still they sit
inside their wall. Like a trained chorus
they still repeat that England made the
war, that Louvain was not destroyed, that
Itheims was not bombarded, that their
Fatherland is the unoffending victim of
world-jealousy.”
And he is concerned, and rightly con-
cerned, about the attitude of the U.S. He
can find little in his country to be proud
of. His chief plea is, curiously enough, the
one that, tested by statistics, proves value-
less. Here it is: “Our sympathy has poured
out for Belgium a spring-tide of help and
relief.... Our charity is the only way we
have of telling we are with you (the Allies)
.... We send bread and bandages to the
wounded....” True, the U.S. have con-
tributed to the funds for the relief of Bel-
gium, contributed, as was perhaps inevitable,
in the glax-ing light of publicity, almost as
if tiie name of the president was Ford. But
the U.S. is a big and rich country. A poor
man who gives half-a-crown to the Belgian
Relief Fund contributes more than a mil-
lionaire who gives £lOOO. Figures have
been published showing the cash receipts
in London of the Belgium Relief Fund up
to June 30. The United Kingdom contri-
buted £308,000. N.S.W. contributed
£264.000. The third and fourth places of
receipts other than Belgian in the list were
filled respectively by Victoria and Maori-
land. The U.S. came fifth, with merely
£64.000. N.S.W., with but a million and a
half of people, gave Belgium four times as
much as did the much-advertised American!
And the whole of Australia gave eleven
times as much as the country inhabited by
Owen Wister and Noah Ford. And
though these figures are only for June 30
they, offer a fair basis of comparison; for,
considering the amount of publicity given to
their first contributions, it is not at all
likely that the U.S. would have omitted to
advertise the fact if it had very largely in-
creased its contributions since. And even if
it had, the figures for N.S.W. for November
19 show that instead of the £264,000 con-
tributed by June 30 the Belgian Relief
Fund for this State then stood at £650.000
—more than double the June figures. Is it
likely that the U.S. has doubled her figures
without her mentioning the matter? It is
alleged that the U.S. contributions were
largely foodstuffs, and it is stated that in
foodstuffs the U.S. gave £814,000. Even so,
Australia’s contribution, in which must be
also included gifts in kind, practically equals
that of the infinitely richer and infinitely
more populous U.S.A.! .
And though Owen Wister clings patheti-
cally to this doubtful plea, he can find little
other comfort in the attitude of the U.S.
“Since August, 1914, we have stood listening
to the cry of our European brothers-in-
liberty. They did not ask for our feeble arm
to strike in their cause, but they yearned for
our voice, and did not get it. Will History
acquit us of this silence?”
That will depend upon whether the Kaiser
or the Allies write that history.

plosive shell sent him to hospital, blind and

sight. Some of these songs he composed in

Norman Lindsay on glue and cabbages
There is a certain type of mind which seems
stirred at intervals by some obscure process of
egotism, to record its disapproval on matters of
Art. It is a type of mind whose industry does not
deserve the compliment of a refutation, but rather a
reproof administered in the tone of voice in which
one shoos an obtrusive fowl off the premises.
I make this premise in regard to one “Masetto’s”
objections to certain alleged errors in Louis Stone’s
novel, Betty Wayside. The fact that these errors
were not errors, but merely evidences of Stone’s
technical knowledge of his subject is not the point.
The point concerns a somewhat larger issue than the
integrity of an author’s knowledge of the internal
arrangements of a violin. The point, in fact, is of
such an obvious nature that one is ashamed of parad-
ing it as a point at all. But in the presence of a
mind like “Masetto’s” one must either stand con-
founded, or assume perforce the attributes of a
schoolmaster. Let it be said, then, that a novel,
even if it deals with music, need not necessarily be
a text-book on the manufacture of violins, or the
correct deportment for musicians. The business of
a novelist does not concern either trade secpets s or
etiquette, but the emotions of the human heart. It
is his business to create his characters, to group them
together as their temperament and environment de-
mand, to show them under the stress of this emotion
or_ of that, and by his art convey a sensation that
this stage-play of his creatures reflects an actual
vision of life.
He must stand or fall by the ingenuity with
which he. conducts the difficult business, 1 and if he
can convince us of the humanity of his work, and
stir our admiration by the way he does it, he may
say the moon is made of green cheese without abating
a jot the value of his achievement.
All great art teems with trifling errors. The
quality of a great artist is that he can aiford to
make mistakes. It is only the compilers of works
on the manufacture of violins, or the production of
cabbages, who must step carefully, for the experi-
menter is close upon their heeis. and vengeance .
will follow a wrongful hint that leads to wasted glue,
or the wilful destruction of the cabbage.
“Masettd’s” difficulty appears to be not one of
malice, of which I readily acquit him, but of a
mistaken application. The nourishment his. mind
requires will not be found in the simple text-book
of Art, but in that more subtle, ritual. that attends
the cultivation of the cabbage.
“Mid-Channel” on a feud that is becoming futile:
Whoever Louis Stone is, I submit on behalf of
“Masetto,” or “Bellerive” or myself, that it hardly
becomes a writer—specially one of the tragic pre-
tentiousness of Louis Stone —to practically class a
contributor as a coward because he writes under a
nom de plume , “Masetto” has, it must be inferred,
sufficient reason, which is sufficient justification,_ for
writing under that name. It is his business‘ and
not Louis Stone’s. -Suppose Louis Stone is right
in his contention that orchestral members show their
appreciation “in the traditional manner,” his point
is to prove himself corrept, thereby proving “Masetto”
to be incorrect. But to wish to, as it were, take it
out of “Masetto’s” hide for presuming to differ with
him, reveals him as a man who suffers from the
least admirable form of innocence. Now I don’t
know much about the practices of fiddlers, but since
this storm in the teacup between L. Stone and
“Masetto” commenced I’ve taken the trouble to
make inquiries among violinists of top-hole quality,
and most of them agree that “Masetto’s” version is
correct. Anyway, who owes the man the 3d,?
We were sittin’ in the firin’ line
A~x>layin’ auction bridge,
As ice took a spell from figlitin’,
Just in front of Walker’s Ridge...
A captain crawled up swearing.
Ilis oaths were worse than "Damn.
When a shell-ease clipped ’is-’cad off.
An’ the sentry says, “Grand Slam '.
I don’t mind bombs and rifles,
An’ I like a bay'net charge.

When the shrapnel is at large.
An’ when I gets to ’Stralia,
An’ ’ears the whistlin’ train,
It’s the nearest pub for shelter
From shrapnel once again....
And, after having been sniped at: —
When you get back to Australia
(That’s if you’ve got the luck),
An’ your tabby runs to ’ug yer,
You'll feel inclined to duck. . ..

That the Turks are on the run;

And the billiard-cue’s ’is rifle.
Me Brother Wot Stayed at ’Ome. . .
If ’e can shirk ’is duty,
And won’t come out and drill,
Well, two can play the same game;
Then in conies Kaiser 8i11....
But if I do get shrapnelled,
Though I die without a groan,
Well, the one who’s really killed me
Is Me Brother Wot Stayed at 'Ome.

Kidney Trouble
A Scientific Cure.
There is only one real scientific method of
curing kidney disease, and that is to wash
away the uric acid (the poison) right out of
the system.
The proper way for this to be done is to
drink from three to four pints of pure water
per day, and with each glass of water should
be taken some mild yet penetrating antisep-
tic. The proper one to take is contained
in De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills.
It has the wonderful property of penetra-
ting every crevice of the kidneys and blad-
der, and wherever it touches it washes away
all sediment and bad secretions, and makes
the kidneys and bladder perfectly healthy.
Any sufferer can try this experiment for him-
self by getting a box of De Witt’s Kidney
and Bladder Pills at his chemists—all chem-
ists sell them —and you will, within a very
a
Poisonous pain-causing Uric Acid in the

few hours, know positively that the seat of
the trouble has been touched. When you see
the muddy, blue-colored urine you know this
is true. The effect of this experiment is most
remarkable.
The quick relief which these wonderful
little pills bring is, so our readers say, noth-
ing short of marvellous. This applies equally
to rheumatism, gout, gravel, backache, tired
feeling, dropsy, Bright’s disease, constipa-
tion, cloudy urine, inflammation of the blad-
der, or other symptoms of urinary trouble.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid of
the cause —the poisonous uric acid. Re-
member to do this a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder, and not
through the bowels, as most kidney pills do.
When you see the urine change to a muddy,
bluish color—a feature which distinguishes
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from all
others—you know beyond all doubt that
they have put their healing touch on the
right spot—the kidneys and the bladder. A
wonderful pill—straight to the kidneys—
that is why De Witt’s Pills give such amaz-
ingly quick relief —every time. A perma-
nent cure follows in almost every case. Look
for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2/9 box of
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills, which
are made expressly for kidney and bladder
trouble.

The Brave Wind.
All day the sea-wind shook the house
Until we longed for peace;
The roaring waves held high carouse
Along 'the lonely beach.
Indoors, at ease with books and chat,
We mourned for bright days past.
While on the hearth the spft, coiled cat
Heard in her doze the blast.
There in that high, secluded room,
When talk no more ran free,
The brave wind had a sullen boom
Like England’s guns at sea.
Thus silence deepened as the night
Crept in to touch with pain
Our circling thoughts and guide their flight
To stricken fields again.
But loud and long the free wind sang
Its shouting song of joy,
Bidding grey Care and Death go hang
And find some new employ.
And presently one said, “Ah, well,
Who’ll take a walk with me?”
And so we tumbled out pell-mell
And wandered by the sea.
The brave wind sang,, the white surf crashed
And eager laughter flew,
And from our trembling lips was uashed
Thought’s cup of Lethe-brew.
Care never stalks with wind-whipped shroud
Along the sea’s clear marge,
Nor waits with poison, bent and bowed.
Where Ocean’s squadrons charge.
Throw wide the casement to the wind,
Or with it tramp along,
For it is cheerful, wise and kind
And sings a marching song.

While a jocund gipsy-breeze rolls upon the

JOHN BULL COUNTS VOLUNTARY-
ISM OUT.
It had to come. That much was settled
long ago, not at any caucus or by the great
heart of the nation, but by the pressure of
circumstance. Conscription in Britain
became a moral certainty the day Russia
loosened her grip on Poland and Galicia.
Realisation of the failure in Gallipoli
brought it at once to the front of political
issues Had John Bull played the game
with himself he would have broken with
voluntaryism when the retreat from Mons,
the tall of Mauberge and the capture of
Antwerp revealed the terrible nature of the
struggle for supremacy that must follow.
Bvit John stuck his head in the sand and
refused to look ; pulled his collar up over his
?nnntn nd i ( e r llH i d - t 0 listen - For months and
months he lived in an atmosphere of make-
believe, comforting himself with censored
newspaper yarns and the reflection that
everything would turn up trumps in a day
or two. He was fighting for life against a
powerful, well-equipped, brainy enemy, who
hail organised for war with patience and
thoroughness. That such a foe could be
withstood, let alone beaten, by anything
aU S the a nllied force at the ' disposal of
all the allied nations was never believed bv
any sane observer. Voluntaryism doesn't
break down when every citizen’s services are
calamity to T P r ? ve «t a stupendous national
calamity. It simply becomes a jest, a time-
wasting nuisance. That recognition of this
was so long coming in Britain has been due
caus ® s ~P ar ty politics, the dead
a , tv P recedent > , stupendous fraud
called Diplomacy and a hundred others, but
mainly the prolonged hiding of the brutal
truth, in the light of which only can national
Policy,and civic # duty be safely determined.
The voluntary system may be all right in
a country whose military requirements can
be met by sending an army over the road to
put up a post-and-rail fence somewhere or
chase a sheep-stealer into the bush. But it
is no use, and never has been, to a nation
living next door to someone who is liable to
arrive before daylight in a vast horde and
start tearing things up and knocking thin°s
down and chasing the population with "a
knife. Nor to a country which, while pre-
tending that all it wants is an army of small
proportions, yet gets itself, by tern tori a
ownership, financial obligations, alliance.,
and political responsibilities, tied up at tne
tail end of a tornado. And it is somewhere
about there that Britain has been living
since the Magnificent Isolation doctrine ot
Gladstone ceased to govern public policy,
and Germany commenced to see red and
accumulate a navy. If Britain had been
content to stand by and see Europe punched
to pieces—to view Germany leaping over her
frontiers and settling down from the North
Sea to the Persian Gulf— voluntaryism might
have stood the test. But as Britain was not
prepared to do this thing, and as it stood
committed to resist it happening, an army
that seemed big enough, for relatively trump-
ery enterprises became useless. And just
as" naturally, when the task of lifting it
from thousands to millions became impera-
tive, the machinery for the job was not
there.
* * * •
No one conceives that military service is
in itself a good thing. The world may some
day evolve a plan for ridding itself of naval
and military burdens. No casuistry _ can
make of war anything but a horrible night-
mare- —a hideous, bloodstained monster. But
it is just because of its horror, and because
it is still something that must be reckoned
with whether people like it or not, that pre-
paration for resisting it is as solemn a com-
munal duty as resistance of plague or any
other curse. Necessity in these matters is
the test of social duty. Were there no
racial rivalries and visions of plunder and
desires for aggrandisement—were acts of
brigandage such as lately brought woe and
misery unspeakable to Belgium and Servia
beyond the pale of possibility—then military
service would be as unnecessary as police in
Paradise. But the world is a long way from
that. Most of it is running with blood and
the rest of it hard at work supplying things
to keep the stream going. That it is the
citizen’s duty to assist in repelling an
enemy’s assault upon the life and liberty of
his nation there can, then, be no difference
of opinion. The only, contest is as to
whether he should be left to perform that
duty as an act of personal choice or do it
in obedience to a national organisation. And
the difference between the two plans has in
practice turned on whether it were better
for a nation to depend on a system from
which disorder and confusion .and uncer-
tainty and delay are inseparable, or on one
from which all those perils are eliminated.
It seems such an obvious proposition that it
speaks little for our national common-sense
that, it has taken 18 months of disaster to
extract from us the right answer, and then
only grudgingly.
DEMOCRACY AND THE SECOND-
HAND WALLOP.
The English language has never been the
language of England. When Asquith
delivers an oration he speaks in a tongue
which is a mixture of the fag-ends of many
languages co-related and organised on the
basis of a foreign grammar, but which is
very far from being the speech of Bill
Smith. Even Bill does not talk in a uni-
form way, for in the North of England he
wants to aspirate every vowel, and in the
South he has no real use for an aspirate at
all, except in stray cases where it can only be
introduced by a miracle of fierce enuncia-
tion. Asquith, on the other hand, follows
a careful line of selection in vowels which
must be aspirated, and Is equally careful not
to aspirate others. Therein he observes the
rule of neither North nor South, but takes
a path of compromise long ago made as the
result-of argument between printer and
author. Again, Bill Smith, following the
natural genius of the language and the
honest usage of Chaucer, Gower and our
best early writers, piles his negatives one
on another to give point and force to denial.
it shall not be,” says Asquith, with the
We i g <,T Of *? is whole body and soul on the
u° T T T “amt never going to be,” says
bill, getting his emphasis by the double
negative, which is true to the English form
and was recognised as correct before
Asquiths pure English was born. But if
Bill reads a book he must read it in a
language which was made for him, and
is not historically or instinctively liis
own. Between true English and pure Eng-
lish he struggles for .expression and feels
himself more or less a foreigner on his own
ancestral clay-patch.
'What is true of language is true in
nearly every department of life. The vast
perspiring bulk of Englishmen have had
things cut and dried for them by the few
sneciaTfipm m p nd t Q° k P° ssessi <m of each
i-' „ Bill Smith had no say in
the making of the national Constitution, of
the national Church, of the national system
Pohtics, or of the form and shape of the
national army and navy of which lie is
expected to be patriotically proud More
supposing fW 6 18 no really guod reason for
supposing that any one of these things with
the possible exception of the navy, follows

Government which seems to have very little

to smash a way to hnal victory by sheer
weight of numbers and munitions or wa .
On all hands the cry is raised that demo-
cracy has failed, and it is possible that on a
referendum vote millions of Englishmen
would hurl away their boasted liberties
which are the growth of seven centuries, loi
the chance of striking a more powerful and
united blow at the Kaiser. Bill BMITH
has come to fancy that he distrusts himself,
when his real distrust is of the system that
gives him the show of power and withholds
the substance. The reform of English
military affairs by popular vote is certainly
in the present crisis about as hopeless as the
reform of the Devil by. soaking him in beer;
nevertheless there is . perfectly decen
ground for believing that if the British arm}
had been first and last built up by the tree
votes of a people whose eyes were open
all their surrounding circumstances, the
crisis would never have arisen. . But the
voting power of the people was in the past
narrowed down to a pinpoint width of choice.
Tweedledum asserted that conscription was
unnecessary and wanted an army of 2UU,UUU;
Tweedledee declared that conscription was
wrong and said an army of 100,000 was suf-
ficient. The voting public replied that if
Tweedledum’s assertion was right Iweedle-
dee’s estimate of needs was big enough ; and
the thing went at that.
The fact that the war is making clear
is not that democracy fails when concerted
and immediate action is necessary, or that
democracy lacks foresight or insight or any
of the other things that count, but that it
is necessary to go the whole pork in systems
of government, and that hybrid systems with
false names are a serious menace. France,
the most democratic nation in the present
controversy, has so far put the best face
'towards the foe; Germany, which is prac-
tically the will of one man, is no more
united in purpose than the republic which
rose on a smashing revolution and carried
forward less baggage from the past than
most nations. Even France is scarcely a
democracy in the best sense, but she has at
least the spirit that makes for democracy.
England, on the other hand, which is mostly
a brag of freedom mixed with a devotion to
old forms, attempts to lift the whole weight
of the Middle Ages off .the lid of the ballot-
box every time she desires to record a vote.
Bill Smith, though he is blissfully igno-
rant of the fact, could scarcely live under a
less democratic system—even if he were to
emigrate to the land of Woodrow Wilson.
What the war is likely to do before it closes,
or what is • likely to happen in the grim
time of reckoning which immediately fol-
lows, is not a reversal of democratic aims,
but a determination to make those aims hit
the target. If Bill Smith must fight and
toil and suffer and pay for his right to be a
citizen, it is up to him to know the exact
meaning of things, and to see that his pain
and effort and hard cash are not wasted.
That view alone, once it penetrates his
brain, must make him keen to be d democrat
in the fuller sense.

Australia, which up to the present has
been mostly a loose piece of England in a
bigger hat, has to face exactly the same
problem. The British conduct of the war
has been duplicated on a smaller scale by
the Australian handling of expeditionary
forces; and the fault does not lie with our
democracy' but with our lack of it. It is
true that Australians have voting power
to a point; but it is also true that such
voting power cannot directly affect political
action, but must operate on a machine orig-
inally imported from England, and since
then altered by the removal of some orna-
mental lumber and the addition of a number
of cranks and pinions which add to the
complicated nature of the mechanism. More,
than this, the Australian machine has
become the roosting place of various heavy
and cumbersome birds, such as Liberal and
Reform Leagues, Political Labor Leagues,
Trades Halls, Farmers and Settlers’ Asso-
ciations and the like; and by mere votin'*
power the wheels cannot be made to turn
at all until one or all of these creatures mav
consent to lift a tail or hop out of the road
Democracy can never be true to label until
the mdmdual citizen gets into direct grips
with Ins own legislation. As in England
the question of compulsory war service
has been bothering us a lot latelv, and
statesmen, vaguely threaten to bring con-
scription into force if such and such things

of freeing the country from external danger.
Then The Bulletin wearily turned over a
handful of clippings and found that, a daj
01 Two before, this same organ was giving
three cheers for Hughes’s disastrous obser-
vation that “Australia has nothing to do
with the conduct of the war. Our business
is to do what we are told. And lust pre-
vious to that it had laid down the law with
great profundity in these terms:—
Mr Hughes is on unimpeachable ground when he
declares" that we should limit our external trade as
much as possible to Britain and her Allies. . . .The
idea behind it, that a complete re-arrangement of com-
mercial relations favorable to our Allies and unfa\oi-
able to our enemies will have to follow the war, is
one that will find general acceptance.
So the sermonising at various dates from the
one pulpit may be summarised into a new set
of Commandments for Australians, delivered
-by the prophet of Calico Jimmy :
The business of bringing the war to an end is not
one that you must think about. But it is very
important that your mind shall be so wholly occupied
with the matter that you must not allow any other
subject to divert your thoughts. It is important that
there shall be a complete re-arrangement of commer-
cial relations; but you must not think of these yet
awhile, it being your main business to refrain from
thinking, so that Von Sauerkraut and Sohn and
other w'ell-informed persons who know where to get
cheap socks and pianos and disinfectants may not be
placed at a disadvantage when the war is over.
All of which is a good answer to Governor
Strickland, of the Ma State, who a month
or so ago, when referring to Australian in-
dustry, asked: “Well, what are you going to
do about it except talk?’ Do? Nothing!
And why even talk? * #
This making of appeals to the community
to sit down and do nothing because the time
is not ripe is the oldest device of the enemy
of Australian progress. The last thing the
foreign trader wants to see is Australia get-
ting seriously to work to supply her own
requirements. To him any movement in
that direction is either Socialism or dis-
loyalty to the Empire, or an interference
with the law of supply and demand, or any
old thing that suits the exigencies of the
moment. Hence this maundering exhorta-
tion to leave the mess at the old address, and
let someone else tidy it all up later on, so
that we may all start off the mark together
and get a fair deal and proceed calmly and
soberly to find out whether Australia really
can manufacture frying-pans, because if the
frying-pan is not up to the mark it will of
course be clear that the idea of potted
asparagus is ludicrous. The great thing is
to get delay. Months ago The Bulletin
urged the appointment of a Minister for
Peace, whose business would be to put before
Parliament and the nation definite proposals
for bringing Australia’s wood-and-water
joeyism to an end—to lead Australia along
the pathway of reform, so that by the time
the war was over the country would be self-
reliant and could fend for itself instead of
being still dependent on foreigners. The
suggestion holds good to : day, even if the
Minister did nothing more than act as a
counterblast to the multitudinous “interests”
conspiring to . side-track an issue of vital
concern by blither about the war, and the
next generation, and terms of peace, and all
the rest of it. The uproar there will be if
the war ends and Australia stands where
she was before is horrible to even think of—
the wild clamor over 4763 schemes for put-
ting things right, or making them worse, or
starting a State ’roos’-tail-soup factory, or
appointing a Royal Commission to report:
the ravings about cutting the painter, and
helping the Motherland, and not provoking
reprisals; the months and years of fevered
squabblings over the quality of imported
chutney and crabs’ tails and bathing-suits.
And, meanwhile, the public debt is going up
like the spirit of the just, and Australia’s
import trade that was collared by Germany
is being collared by someone else whose name
is very often Fritz von Kaus ; present
address. Kobe or Chicago. And so it is going
w~Ciu h m \ ghty . f ew people doing anything
but talk, and quite a lot of them moving the
adjournment of the debate until the Last
Trump sounds.

ce on his own soil—posi-


tions selected and fortified when all Europe,
was asleep—and the power required to drive
him from these is very much the same as
the power required to blow him oft the map.
So the defeat of Germany is practically
assured; but there is no sort of guarantee
that the war will ever end. .
Well. I say that if it doesn’t it may do
US With' a double ring of tremendous fort-
resses mounting the hugest cannon . and
overhung with a permanent cloud of poison-
ous vapor, Germany might elect to go. on
with her work in her commodiotis prison
while the allied nations went on with theirs
in the larger sphere without.. Once m a
century or so a great battle might be fought
and the German dominions as a result ex-
tended by five acres or reduced by SU, and
every day there might be a bombardment
somewhere to keep things at their proper ten-
sion ; but in the main the huge siege-war
would be waged without loss of life 01 like-
lihood of change. Always the drums would
beat and the call to arms he heard; but,
force against force and science against
science, the war would become a settled in-
stitution, until ages hence the German curi-
osity might overcome the German pride and
the prisoner nation be willing to crawl in
the dust that it might see with its humbled
eyes the wonder of the woild beyond the
P °Of n course, even this might never happen.
The war might simply become a settled
habit and continue with the regularity of a
gas bill or the circling of the sun. But
all the time not one string could be relaxed
or one effort diminished on the part of the
Allied Nations; for the criminal within the
cage would become more and more dangerous
as the years went on, and be painted by the
imagination of the free world outside as
even more dangerous than he really was. .
Despite its pain and horror and. the price
that must be paid for it, there is nothing
like war to brace a nation up and show
what it is made of. A permanent war
though not necessarily destructive, would
carry with it the potentialities of sudden
calamity in a manner that would keep
nations on the tiptoe of expectation and
compel them to develop their resources to
the limit. It would keep the world awake.
Shams would be broken up small by it and
hurled on the rubbish-tip; and the military
drain upon the nations would put real value
on work and keep the people at it. It
would, in point of fact, be the amplification
of the old Greek notion that war was the
natural condition of the world and that
peace was only to be regarded as a sort ot
sobering up between battles. Every manly
virtue would be held in honor; patriotism
would mean more than shelter behind a
paper flag; invention and discovery would
keep active minds at high pressure; poetry
and the finer arts would have a perpetual
inspiration; order would everywhere prevail
over chaos, and evolution would be provided
with better material for its attempt to turn
out the super-man. _ , ~
Plainly, then, there is a lot to be said
every way for the establishment of the
present struggle on a permanent basis. But
perhaps the most important thing of all is
that such an arrangement would secure the
peace of the outer world. . e ,
The cause of big wars is mostly forgetful-
ness. If a victorious nation could really
remember what it suffered in achieving vic-
tory it would take a lot of provocation to
make it draw the sword again; certainly it
would never lend itself to a secret prepara-
tion for military aggression. When the
Dutch set themselves up in Java they knew
better than to supersede all the 20 or so
native kings. They superseded all but two.
These two, the hostile Sultans of boerakarta
and Djokjakarta, they suffered to remain
in the very heart of the island, where they
remain to' this day serving as shocking
examples to the rest of the inhabitants, who
are expected every evening to thank then-
gods that they have the benevolent Dutch-
man for a ruler instead of the old native
kings. In similar fashion, to make one
war permanent in Europe would keep the
world’s memory always keen and fresh.
And the holding of Germany to her last
refuge of shame would, knit the Allied
nations closer and closer in bonds of brotner-
bood. The world has never had a united
interest. The old trade bonds of which the
Cobdenite used to rave were really more like
tin tacks on the carpet of progress than
silken threads of amorous dalliance. Com-
merce waged its wars with plenty of fero-
city ; but face to face with a real war which
might at any time burst its bounds and
pour forth in floods of fire and destruction,
trade and industry would become the docile
things they ought to be. The war, Properly
set and in for a long innings, would.be a
central meeting place of international ideas.
Teach the Russian and the Englishman to
think alike and they draw nearer to one
another every day. With the present war
going on for a century an English, boy wou d
have to ask whether the Marseillaise was
British or French and whether the Czar was-
a Frenchman or an Italian. We should be
mixed in thought and united in purpose to
such an extent that some day. we should
forget that there were any nations m tne
great Entente and hold a general election on
a world-wide plan-
RIME.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Art of Falling Off a Log.
The ease with which bills before Parlia-
ment can be dropped, mislaid or for |
by the Government in power shows the tolly
of the Political Labor Party' in wasting iL
time adding to or improving its present
platform while the machinery to enforce its
will is still lacking. Theoretically, the
PLL or P.L.C. or whatever it may be
called’has the right to dictate to members
of a Labor Cabinet; but Holman and others
have proved that, in practice it is the Labor
Cabinet which dictates to the P.L.L. Lven
when forced to bring in a measure an adept
like Holman can still have his v\ay } vlt
regard to its getting on the statute book oi
lt!yin g oft. It is the easiest tiling m the
world to stand on a plank of the Labor
platform with a do-or-die expression and
then stumble ancl fall off the thing if ■some-
body merely tips up the edge with a whiff
of criticism. Of course, in Holman’s case
the greater trouble is that he so often for-
gets that there is a Labor platform at all;
but even when he remembers it the fact does
not matter to any extent. This humbug of
drafting bills, wasting endless time oyer
their discussion, and then simply allowing
them to fall into the waste-paper basket
needs to be dealt with. The Referendum
with Initiative, on which the Labor party
was once so keen, but which has been
stuffed away in the dustiest pigeon-hole,
would fix matters up once and for all. In
countries where it is law it gives the poli-
tical boss no room for slipping off the log
or otherwise losing his balance. The result
of the referendum must be embodied in a
bill and put before Parliament within a
given number of days, and there is no side-
stepping the issue by any trick that the most
eel-like politician can invent. In particular,
it is time Laborites presented an automatic
at Holman’s head, demanded the Refer-
endum with Initiative, and said plainly and
effectively that they will shoot if they don’t
get it. Once the people get this measure the
State will have a direct means of doing
things, and nobody will care very much
whether the Premier keeps his promises or
not, or whether he falls off every separate
log and cracks his reputation in a different
way at every fall.
Feeding the Guns with Bahies.
The Cologne Gazette weeps a gallon of
crocodiles’ tears and says that the wicked
British blockade is going to have the. effect
of hitting Germany’s children, while it lets
the fighting man go on killing with enough
eatables to keep him fit. If this means
anything at all it means that the German
will continue to fight at the expense of lus
children —will, in point of fact, use the
babies to feed the cannon. The I logman
has shown such kindly regard for the chil-
dren of Belgium, France and Servia—not
to speak of those killed in the Fnghsh Last
Coast raids—that we are quite ready to
believe him. Of course we are sorry. But
if the German starves his child that he may
feast himself he can scarcely blame us. lo
murder the children of Germany or any
other country is, thank Goo, no part of the
plan of the Allies; and if the Hogman holds
up his own offspring to shield lnmself from
the bullets he has provoked, their slaughter
is his own responsibility. lhe Allied
nations are forced in . the light of
German action - amj motives to considei
their own children; and if it is a case ot
French and British infants being sacrificed
or the German infant being murdeTed by
the obstinacy of his father, the German
must be the one to suffer. The philosophy
of the situation is not a pleasant one; but
as the Allies are fighting wau itself, and as
the peace of the future may depend upon the
view which the children of to-day take ot
bloodshed and carnage, it may he that the
fates which seem to rule these things are
forcing certain lessons home where they are
most needed. Somebody said with regard
to religious teaching that if lie had the
children for their first seven years anybody
could take them then and try to drill any
knowledge or nonsense he could into them.
The first lessons were those that would
really stick. So Fate may' be ruling that
the German child of to-day, who remembers
in his manhood his mother’s desperate at-
tempts to keep up the supply of sausage,
shall not shout eager “Hochs !” for war when
some mad king or fool chancellor begins
waving a rusty sword and GoTT-strafing the
universe.

A Sudden Yell for Something Dark.
Melbourne Age is quite frank about one
thing, anyhow. It wants Brown Brother
back. After raging the other day at the coma-
tose attitude of the politicians towards the
problem of Cinderella, it suddenly knocked
off pointing the censorious finger and became
constructive: —
It is not a white man’s job pioneering in the
Tropics. What was done in Queensland may be
done more effectively in the Northern Territory. The
supreme need of the Territory is a policy that will
permit colored labor to be imported on a contract
system.
Well, and what was done in Queensland.
The country was certainly not pioneered by
Tommy Tanna, or Ah Quee ; and so far as
the Northern Territory is concerned, all the
pioneering done in the long years the gentle-
man who is now a “supreme need” had a
free run thereabouts was in picking the eyes
out of the mining fields, starting the. sly-grog
industry, and spreading syphilis. Still, there
is a practical side to this business, and Ihe
Bulletin invites the Age to name the par-
ticular industry in the Territory for which
black labor is necessary on the ground that
the work cannot be performed by whites.
Incidentally the Age might explain whether
railway construction is pioneering work. If
it is, then that form of pioneering will have
to be excluded from the rest, for _ according
to the latest report of the Administration
the 500 men employed on the Pine Greek
line have enjoyed such exceptional health
that Gilruth doubts whether in any other
part of the world such a good record of free-
dom from sickness has been established. And
Gilruth, who ought to know what he is
talking about at least as well as the Age,
makes no demand for colored reinforce-
ments. What he says the Territory needs
is a systematic effort to settle it —by whites.
Until that is done and reasonable proof
exists that the white cannot do the work of
the pioneer, what is the use of yelling in
defiance of evidence that the place one
where only' the coolie can thrive ! “The
climate,” says Gilruth, “offers no bar to
development by white labor. . . .The evidence
available is that the Territory is quite as
healthy for white people as any other part
of the world.” Of course if the Territory
is let go hang any old thing can happen,
but a howl for black brudder to do pioneer
work that “cannot be done by anyone else,’
when in point of fact someone else is doing
it, looks like making an interjection at the
wrong moment.

The opening of the Panama Canal is caus-
ing the Federal Director of Quarantine a
good deal of anxiety. The mosquito which
carries yellow fever, or its twin brother,
exists in Australia, and if the disease should
happen to land the brute would take a
shameless delight in spreading the cuise.
The distance to the fever centres is mucli
shortened by the canal route, and although
it is still. comparatively great,, there are
intermediate ports at which the disease might
establish itself in preparation for an attack
on this continent. Dr. Cumpston believes
that a trained sanitary officer should be
planted at Panama, and that others should
keep watch at Samoa and Tahiti to report
on anything suspicious coming our way. Ihe
idea is good ; but why not get to work nearer
home? The fever-carrying . mosquito has
been fought to a finish in some South Ameri-
can districts and in others has been lut so
hard and often that its infanly is much re-
duced. Presumably something of the same
sort can be done here. To get our blow in
first is the great thing. When the yellow
scourge is actually here it will be too late
to take precautions. In dealing with the
germ-carriers there is any amount off room
for battle practice in Sydney and Brisbane
suburbs. Kerosene, put in the right place,
can work wonders; but the municipalities
allow the nightly torment to continue with-
out getting after the pest with the deadly
juice If the hunting of the yellow fever-
bearer is no more enthusiastic than the chase
after the ordinary sleep-destroyer, sanitary
officials mav be planted at every coral bump
in the Pacific and the disease will sooner or
later be nicely distributed in spite of them.
The military census in Maoriland ie\ealed
that, apart from men who had already volun-
teered or been rejected or were foreigners,
there were 110,000 persons of military age
in the Dominion ready to serve under arms
“if required”; 44,000 willing to peiform
some civil duty; and 34,000 who were un-
willing to give any sort of help. Where-
upon various politicians of the carpet-bag
order were filled with great joy and pointed
out that an “enormous number” of men were
prepared to spring to arms, reckoning, of
course, that the 110,000 -willing workers
would carry things through without the un-
pleasant necessity of saying anything to the
34 000 quitters, who possess votes. Mean-
while, when the last mail left, men for rein-
forcements were coming forward with such
alacrity that there was room for hundreds
more; which also meant that there were
openings for making speeches,' and having
processions, and inciting bands to play and
taking a large brush and bucket of paste and
adorning the local hoarding with the postei
that niaketh the martial spirit rise like
dough in the baker’s trough. All of which
forms an unanswerable argument against
any departure from our inherited system of
muddle and disorganisation, or interfering
with chaos, or doing anything to interrupt
the inherent right of a citizen to look
out of the window and put his fingers to his
nose when he hears a neighbor wrestling at
the front gate with a tiger and yelling for
help.
The infinite resource of the Australian
Defence Department, is beyond ordinary
admiration. If it can't win victories in one
way it will in another. A new plan has just
been developed. Something goes wrong, and
there is an outcry about it. The Adminis-
tration inquires into it and announces that
the necessary measures have been taken and
the public 'won’t hear any more of that
trouble. And the public doesn’t—simply
because the Censor is then put to work and
the press is instructed that nothing more is
to be published about that matter without
the Censor’s approval. It is such an obvious
way of winning victories that one marvels
it wasn’t thought of long ago. Heaven only
knows; for example, why Kitchener and
the Kaiser go on pounding one another when
each could inform the morning papers that
his own side had won the decisive battle
yesterday afternoon. When decisive vic-
tories can be won by a general and one lady
tvpist at 30s. a week it seems ,a fearful waste
for a country to hire 50 generals and an
army of a dozen millions. Still, we suppose
every country can’t have a Pearce at the
head of its Defence Administration.
-♦ —
Prime Minister Hughes, having had his
own leg pulled most unmercifully over the
metal business, of which he naturally hasn t
even the most elementary knowledge, seems
determined now to pull the public’s. Hence
a column-long shriek at the end of the yeai
about the wonders accomplished in the 12
months. As a matter of f fact no wonders at
all have been accomplished. Aot a single
serious difficulty has been overcome. A few
additions are being made to the lead and cop-
per smelters and refineries, but they would
have been made anyway, simply because the
Belgian and German works are closed to Aus-
tralian concentrates. And, anyhow, Aus-
tralia lias for many years been able to com-
pete successfully with foreign lead smelters
and copper refiners; and what copper it
didn’t itself refine the U.S. mostly took. •
The one ore which Australia sold almost ex-
clusively to Germans Hughes hasn’t made
any progress with. That is zinc. There are
no works under construction here and actu-
ally portions of what small works there are
in England are still idle. Zinc was the only
metal for whose purchase Australia was. cle-
pendent on the German. German-American
smelters have bought a few thousand tons
from us to smelt and then sell to England
at four times the price ; apart from that we
still have no market at all, and our mills are
either shut down or are merely piling up
their products. That, unfortunately, is the
net result of the Government’s efforts to
overcome the real difficulties in connection
with the treatment and sale of Australian
metals. And it will continue to.be the net
result until Britain and Australia agree to
either a thumping tariff or a bonus or both.

A Bill was a while ago introduced to the
U.S.A. Congress to prohibit the employment
of children under 14 years in the textile in-
dustries of the Southern States, and to limit
the labor of children under 16 years to eight
hours a day. It was stated that whole
families settled in the South lived upon the
wages of their infants. There was a class
of men known as ‘‘dinner toters,” whose daily
toil consisted of carrying the child-slaves
dinner every noon. Professor Sleyster s
investigations showed that out of 260 murj
derers whose history had been investigated 5o
per cent, were wage-earnrs before they were
12, and 90 per cent, started work before they
were 15. A startling sidelight on the. ennob-
ling influence of hard graft on the juvenile
character! In Japan capitalists are running
big factories with women and children’s
labor, getting 14 hours a day for about 4sd.
Yet a lot of people seem to think our diffi-
culties will end with the defeat of Germany.
By that time the crop of new problems to be
solved will be enough to keep Labor Govern-
ments thinking seriously for some time.
Meanwhile, striking to further unnecessarily
increase the cost of a high-wage country's
output might be profitably suspended. If it
isn’t, we shall not presently have anything
to strike for.
The helpless position of Sydney’s Muni-
cipal Council with regard to the election of
a Mayor, and the necessity which compels
the State Governor to make choice of some-
body to fill the position, raises the .question
whether the whole farce of an elective head
could not with profit be abolished. The
business of a city like Sydney calls for the
presidency'of a person of real knowledge and
special training. The Mayor elected to the
post for a year or hoisted to his seat by
force of the Governor’s edict may have the
best intentions in the world, but in the
nature of things he cannot fill the bill. In
smaller places or in places where the muni-
cipal problems are less acute any leading
citizen with good intentions and a capacity
for listening to the advice of the Town
Clerk and City Surveyor may get along
fairly well; but Sydney’s job is one to test
the ability and ingenuity of a thoroughly
competent expert. There seems no decent
reason in view of this fact why the Mayor-
alty should not be made a permanent office
anil filled by a trained man. The aldermen
could endorse -or reject his main lines of
policy as at present. But it is not so much
the city’s policy that is at fault as the city’s
administration. There the expert would
have a fairly free hand and undertake with
knowledge the tasks which to an ordinary
citizen would be full of difficulty.
The broaching of soldiers’ parcels continues,
particularly, it seems, in; Victoria.- The
latest instances —and surely the most despic-
able —happened around Chrfetmas-time, when
men on guard at various camps were sent
bundles of “cheer” by relatives and pals to
help them over what promised to be a dull
time. In many cases the packages had been
rifled, tins and boxes being emptied and the
parcels then wrapped up again. This is, of
course, entirely a civil matter. It looks the sort
of thing which Victoria’s new Chief- Secretary
might with advantage talk over with Chief
Commissioner Sainsbury. Hardly a day
passes but some complaint is made of simi-
Unto This End.

Hf.re where the sea-road splits the land
The longships swing to the lifting flow,
Hand to the lintel the old men stand
Grey at the gates to watch you go;
Never the shock of a home-sped blow
In flame-scored darkness or naked sun,
In the older world that your toil shall know,
But shall count as a stroke for the younger
one!
By the mound where the Flemish cross-road
runs,
And Wellington’s shouting bugles pealed,
Is the grumbling challenge of English guns.
South and by East is your own red held.
What if with blood and with mire sealed
Your life in the blind trench filters out?
Better be borne on your broken shield
Than carry it back with the brawling
rout!
Men, if our own war-morrow came,
Were we not ripe for the reaping if
Here, on our borders, to steel and flame
Flesh of our flesh we should fear to give?
This is the glad prerogative
Edging the steel in your hard brown
hands —■
Haply to die, that the white flame live
Here on the hearths of the lower lands.
Some of you march where the old Kings led :
What fitter ground than the grey frontiers
Rich with the freight of your fathers’ dead.
Sown with their blood for a thousand
years?
Never an archer below but hears,
Never a doughty of Waterloo
But wakens and knows, ’neatli the harvest-
ears,
The tramp of your vanguard ringing
through.
Some of you hold, by the lapping green,
The peace of the low mounds sparsely-
grassed,
Yet do we reck not the Could-Have-Been,
The hazard that failed, or the die miscast.
Listen, Land-reiver, Iconoclast—
There is balm for the searing our souls
have seen,
And the sword of a dim hour darkly-glassed
Swings low on the city of Constantine!
Stubborn, unknowing of sleep or slack,
Bloodied and sodden and void of breath,
Battering, battered, but flinging back
Buffet and laugh in the teeth of Death,
How shall we heed what the scorner saith—
That the flame of their valor, the deathless
ones
Who fought for the Isle and Elizabeth,
Burns lesser, while you are our kinsmen,
sons ?
Brother whose hand lay late on mine ;
Son whom the thin, locked fingers strain;
Lover with level eyes ashine,
Wards of the scutcheon no mote snail
stain —•
Strike for the North, on the red terrain,
As for the South that your true feet trod
Ere, in the pride that lias purged out pain,
Singing you went from us! Go with God!

A Chance for More Note, Anyhow.
Thebe is nothing much in all the additional
words that have been coming along about
Billjim’s shift of camp from Gallipoli.
Having arrived at a most unhealthy place
in April, he left on tip-toe in December—
and that is all there is about it, except that
Australia feels relieved at hearing of the
camp being broken so successfully. But
long rigmaroles about the move being some-
thing in the nature of a triumphant finale
to a campaign which had great moral in-
fluence on the disturbance are poor stuff.
The enterprise our lads embarked upon
failed. They fought well. They died like
men. So did the other fellow,- Now the
job is to hit him in another place and beat
him and not call unpleasant things by their
wrong name, for along that line, followed
much too far already, lie waste of time,
regret and muddle. The real tragedy of
Gallipoli is not in the death-roll, but in the
fact of the fumbling thereabouts having
assisted the political intrigues of the German
and extended the area of battle without
compensating advantage of any kind to the
Allies. Meanwhile all that can be heard
from the gloom of what Europe calls “the
near East” is a succession of vague noises.
What sort of fireworks the world is going to
see next, and where they are to be looked
for, and what Salonika means are riddles
no one can answer. One thing only there
is no doubt about, and that is that the Hun
submarine is still dodging among the crayfish
and adding to the glorious victories of Von
Tibpitz over crowded passenger steamers
that cannot hit back. In the last big vessel
that was torpedoed from below a member of
the United States consular service was
amongst the murdered, an incident which
will cause much amusement in Berlin, and
no doubt give Brother Wilson an oppor-
tunity to write another Note. Whereupon,
after long delay, the Hun will explain that
he is very sorry, but Americans shouldn’t
keep bad company ; and then there will be
some more Note, and after that somebody
else from Milwaukee will be blown up. All
of which suggests that being a neutral can
be an excitine business ; also that if a neu-
tral only risks showing his nose on the
ocean often enough his country can accumu-
late a highly respectable number of casual-
ties without the unpleasantness of going to
war.
♦
“Quidam” : Though probably very satis-
factory from a scientific point of view, the
meteorological information supplied at great
cost to the public of Australia would be
more appreciated if it were made more
understandable by the average man on the
land, who of all men is most dependent on
weather. It is all very well to remark that
a high-pressure system has made consider-
able easting away out by Boulia, and that
the Northern isobars are somewhat more
pronounced, while closed curves are insistent
n . ear . the State pub at Leonora, but when the
significance of all this behavior is not ex-
plained the average person finds it so little
interesting that he doesn’t read it. If. on
the other hand, it was pointed out that a
certain sequence of conditions generally pro-
duced heavy rain, blizzards, flying ants,
national debts, droughts, etc., intense interest
would be at once aroused. Also, if every
day the scientist explained what these activi-
ties, isobars, closed curves, etc., meant to the
trained intellect, the public would get a fight-
ing chance of training its own intellect as
far as the weather is concerned. The present
learned daily disquisitions as to what is hap-
pening might as well be printed in Greek
or Sanscrit, for the simple reason that they
do not tell in understandable language what
is likely to happen from the weird complica-
tions. Thus an excellent opportunity of
educating the cocky in a subject in which he
really desires education, and which would
not cause him to foam at the mouth and use
dreadful language about Socialistic tigers and
so on, is entirely thrown away. A practical
method of turning the weather report into a
valuable educational influence, and making it
ass well read as the war news, would supplv a
much-needed reform.
William Greenwood, a well-known Mel-
bourne boot-factor who recently came out of
Ins shell to go and do his share of Red Cross
work in Egypt, has been through the Aus-
tralian post-office at Alexandria and learned
something. “The parcels post,” he declares
is the great worry. Hundreds of packages
come with the wrappers in shreds, and they
have to be repacked and readdressed.” The
best method for sending parcels is to “sew
them up in a piece of canvas, put nothing
breakable in, and pack tight as a brick, print
lng the address on the canvas or sewinsr a
label on.” 6

the lack of relationship between the two lead-
ing ladies who dwell side by side in the villas
facing the footlights. And it is quite excus-
able. The sort the senior matron represents
would not be likely to make a confidante of a
married flapper like Dorothy B run ton. Ihe

ence believing that Dorothy is a newly-
married daughter living next door to her
widowed mamma and a whisky-drinking

There were record holiday attendances at

the fatted fowl was getting it in the neck ;
and in consequence the new George Marlow
cash-box is wearing a smile of satisfaction
over the prospect of “Dick Whittington”
settling down to steady business for some
weeks. If the Adelphi maintains the Whit-
tington standard in future productions the
theatre should soon regain the ground it lost
when it played poor bellowdrama in an un-

The principal attraction in Sydney pic-

Old Dutch” at the Crystal Palace. , Albert
Chevalier is alleged to have composed the old
bit of Holland while embracing a street lamp-
post duritig a heavy London fog a quarter of
a century ago, and he has been peddling the
inspiration of those dull, damp moments
with great financial success ever since. In
the filmed production he takes the part of
the Australian Sentimental Bloke’s Cockney
cousin. Florence Turner is the. “old
Dutch,” and Sydney actor-elocutionist
Harry Thomas assists the otherwise-silent
show by rendering the song.

Considered as a war drama, with two
score of names in the cast, and an abnor-
mally loud explosion in the third act,
“Under Fire” has points of superiority over
other melodramas with noises in them. The
plot, as disclosed at Melbourne Royal, has
no suggestion of probability, but the dialogue
is good enough and the excitement at the
Belgian inn when the German invasion
arrives has some thrilling incidents. If the
passing remarks of Leslie Victor, who is a
fleeing Belgian farmer, to poor old inn-
keeper Atholwood don’t convey a full sense
of the horrors of a Hun invasion they are
at least forcible. One gets an impression
ot the truth from Victor’s outbreak. And

Characters played by Kay Souper, Emma

act only. Atholwood, Beatrice Nicholls,
Harry Sweeney, McLarnie, Harcourt and
others are either Belgian victims or German
swankers in the second act, and they all do
their bits successfully. Cyril Mackay is just
one of several voices that sound from the
darkness of the last act. The three prin-
cipals who have more or less to do in every
act. are Frank Harvey, the hero; lan
Maclaren, the stnileless German bigamist;
and Charlotte Ives, the heroine who alien-
ates sympathy at the start by confessing
that she married a forbidding sort of man
in an absurdly secret manner because she
was deeply attached to the other fellow and
he was travelling abroad. All three char-
acters move in a purely melodramatic way,
and the lady, with her cool composure in
perilous moments and her un-English ac-
cent, so unlike a governess, is the least
possible of the three. Harvey is brisk and
buoyant in his wondrous resourcefulness and
his want of precautiousness ; also he shows
passion in moderation. But his early
attempts at a brogue are another insult to
Ireland.
“SO LONG, LETTY," AT SYDNEY

The epicures, Connie Ediss and Chas.
Workman, discover that they have many
“tastes” in common.
The belated announcement of next Satur-

sentimentality. “The Lady of Lyons”
is to be revived for six nights only, and
Julius Knight will enchant Pauline with the
picture of his supposititious palace by the
Lake of Como. Lytton’s play is a curio in
romantic drama—there never was another
like it- —and the girls who have grown up
since Julius last Melcnotted in Melbourne
will find new cause for adoring him.

At the King’s (Melbourne) the comedy

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Heinrich Strassmann, known as Streetman to his
unsuspecting friends, _ .
Was a German spy in London serving Kaiser
liam’s ends
When the war was just beginning; and the purpose
of his plan .
Was to learn the Navy's orders from a simple Wag-
staff man. .
So he haunted Wagstaff’s household certain papers
to obtain, . . ...
And he plotted with the butler, but he plotted all in
vain: , .
For though he’d gulled the governess to wed him on
the sly,
She helped to euchre Henry when she learned he was
a spy.
Larry Redmond told the lady that her “husband” had
And & a "pair of kids in Berlin when she took the
marriage vow.
Yet they did not bring the blighter as a bigamist
to court; . . ..
They let him go on plotting that his plottings they
might thwart,
And they hurried off to Belgium, ere the German
army came
To slaughter frightened citizens and set the land
aflame,
And kept on thwarting Streetman (being game to
do or die), , .
Though the chances were in favor of the enterprising
spy.
They put him in a cellar when they got the man
alone,
Which kept him out of mischief till the ladybird
was flown ;
And then it seemed that Larry had exhausted all his
tricks,
For Streetman (from the cellar) got him fairly in
a fix;
No hope had he of rescue, nor could Larry cut and
run
Whilst his foe had got him covered with a wicked
little gun;
But an orphaned Belgian maiden, who was somehow
lurking nigh,
Plunged a dagger ’twixt the shoulders of the careless
German spy.
And even that was useless, e’en the dagger of the
wench
Couldn’t stop the spy from reaching Number 27
trench
In the British lines near Paris, where brave Larry,
all a-groan,
Came and caught his cunning rival at the fatal tele-
phone
And saved the British army in its blackest hour of
need—
Shure! Larry was a bulldog of the foinest Irish
breed.
Just then there came a bombshell like a planet from
the sky;
It blew the trench to pieces, and it slew the
German spy.
0 Larry, gallant Larry! When we heard from him
once more
He was lying sadly damaged on a dusky chapel floor,
With comrades raving round him, each in sanguinary
plight;
We couldn’t see them suffer —there was not sufficient
light.
Then a message came from Joffre, and a banner
slowly waved,
To notify the wounded that the Allies had been
saved.
And the band played “Tipperary” and the show was
over. Why ?
Well, the plot went all to blazes when it lost the
German spy.

Trust” and then gives convincing reasons
why he should abdicate. In point of clever-
ness and accomplishment pianist Pintel is
the most conspicuous artist present, but he
is obviously uncomfortable on a vaudeville
stage. Of the others Barton and Ashley are
funny, and there are bright spots in the
turns of juggler Kincaid and xylophonist
Cleve, even though they feature the gaudy
clothes of Scawtland.
The pantomime at Melbourne Majesty’s is
doing “capacity” business. “Mother Goose”
is laying eight golden eggs per week, or nine
when a bank holiday supplies an extra nest.
All Adelaide management is unexpectedly
candid : “Chevalier’s impersonation of the
coster is one that you never see twice, on
either stage or screen.”
“Y.Z.”: I notice a curious effect of the
operation of the Earlier Closing Act .in
Melbourne. The city’s favorite get-aways—-
Swanston, Elizabeth and Bourke streets —
are now dangerous to pedestrians- on towards
II p.m. by reason of the excess of broken
bottles. This is particularly noticeable on
Saturday nights and on the eves of great
events. On such a night, for instance, a
decent drunk could not have fallen down
anywhere in Swanston-street after 11 with-
out opening a main artery. Citizens leaving
pubs at half after nine, imagining they are
not drunk enough, arm themselves with
three bottles of noxious drink, and then on
reaching the open air find themselves in-
capable of giving three bottles the affec-
tionate care three bottles call for, and a
smash almost invariably follows. In this
respect the Melbourne man’s inability to
hold his drink is quite astonishing.
“Warre”: Anyone care to bet that this
N.S.W. experiment in State share-farming
will not mean another bit added to the tax-
payers’ load? (1) The locality chosen
(Wyalong-Lake Cudgellico) is in the “risky”
area, where growing wheat provides a gamble
compared with which pak-a-pu and pony-
racing are the mild amusements of wowsers;
(2) the super-tax on agricultural lands will
bring under wheat large areas of “safe” coun-
try, and naturally the best share-farmers
will take up these even if the terms of the
private owners are not as liberal as those
of the State; (3) the average share cocky
unless under strict supervision is a shiftless
cuss, with Holmaniac ideas of finance, getting
into debt anywhere, everywhere and always.
Summed up, the Government is going to em-
bark on a costly scheme of farming on coun-
try which no experienced farmer will touch,
and with a type of farmer who will require
“nursing” from the very jump.
After about six months’ investigation and
a fearful lot of talk the Tas. Munitions Com-
mittee has found that its chance of‘making
any munitions is mud. A couple of months
ago it had the offer of a plant from Britain,
which was to turn out 40 shell-bodies an
hour, and it asked the State Government for
£20,000 to buy it with. The State Govern-
ment turned the idea over to the Defence
Department. Of course, the Defence Depart-
ment did nothing, so after waiting a month
the State Government decided that it had
better go on with the job itself. By this time
the Federal Munitions Committee had discov-
ered that the safety of the Empire would be
imperilled if the machinery were allowed to
leave England. Then Railway Commissioner
Smith, who is an energetic member of the
State Munitions Committee, secured the
offer of a plant from the U.S.A., and asked
if he might get that. Again he was told no ;
and now the disgusted committee wants to
be disbanded.
The existence of Scaddan’s Westralian
Labor Government has been further en-
dangered by the revolt of Bertie Johnston,
who represents the cow-and-cocky constitu-
ency of Williams-Narrogin. Backed by
Labor promises of railways, roads, cheap
reapers and binders and other things John-
ston defeated the Liberal at the 191 l elec-
tions, and having kissed every baby
since born in his electorate and attended
almost every christening, wedding and burial,
he has a big following. His chief grievance
is that Scaddan, after admitting that he and
Minister for Lands Johnson were the guilty
pair of Ministers in the Nevanas business,
declared that he would resign and take a
back seat as a private member. On this
understanding, and moved by the harrowing
appeals of hard-up comrades who were
doubtful about retaining their seats in the
event of a dissolution, Johnston voted at
that time to keep the Government in office.
When, however, caucus met, “a _ servile
majority” refused to accept Scaddan’s resig-
nation and passed a vote of confidence in his
Ministry. This was more than Johnston
could stand, so he broke away from the
party and fired in his resignation as an
Assembly member a week or two ago. He
intends to stand again as an Independent,
and will get in. That Nevanas.-scandal is
likely to make a lot more smell in Westralia
yet.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Mujik” : So “Twin Beds,” which is really
quite harmless unless there is harm in a

ising effect they may have on young minds. There
may be seen placards that would never be permitted
in Paris, and that would not, I believe, long remain
in New York. And all because of a lack of censor-
ship. They suggest that the stage is getting worse
and worse, and it ought to be remembered that a
debased stage means a debased nation.
Well, the picture that yells from the hoard-
ing may be a crude sort of thing, but—has
his Reverence noticed the 12ft. illustrations
revealing the fit and beauty of about 167
different brands of corsets? If he has, what
has he said to the haughty rag merchant
about the tragic effect of these intimate
displays? The Starchbishop’s wail about the
stage getting worse and worse suggests that
he is a long way more familiar with theology
than dramatic literature. It may be that it
is getting worse in the artistic sense, and
that its most distinguished feature is ban-
ality ; but to suggest that it is any less clean
these days than it was even a generation ago,
when nearly everything had an illegitimate
child in it somewhere, is wildly absurd.
What, I wonder, would be the views of the
Church on “Othello” if the box-office got the
assistance of a realistic printer to decorate
the hoardings with what he might decorate
them with !

“Norbell”: Lieutenant Dartnell, an Aus-
tralian serving in South Africa, was the
first actor on record to receive the Victoria
Cross, though in his case it was a posthu-
mous honor, as he died in winning it. Dart-
nell commenced his stage life in Victoria
with Howard Eadie, and with him went to
Westralia with a dramatic co. which ex-
ploded in Perth. After that I played with
him there in several cos., and once sentenced
him to death when he was Robert Emmett
in a show organised by Charles Kenningham
at the Theatre Royal. Dartnell was a fine,
athletic fellow, who before putting on grease-
paint had been a boot salesman.
“Gin Fiz” : Brother Jonathan has pushed
himself into Australian vaudeville to such
an extent that it is a welcome relief to
happen on one of our own kin delivering
home-grown goods that get more applause
than the products offered by importations.
To George Edwardes all Australian versi-
fiers and the public generally should be
grateful. During the past four weeks
Edwardes has been stopping the show at the
Sydney “Nash” to recite some Bulletin
verses by C. J. Dennis. On the several
occasions I saw the show, in which
Edwardes was about the only Australian on
the bill, "The Sentimental Bloke” had his
flights of fancy introduced to a cosmopolitan
crowd that was fairly swept off its feet. The
fact that it was announced that the artist’s
offering was written by Dennis counted for
nothing. It was probable that not many
people in the audience ever heard of “the
honzer tart,” but they had enough gumption
to recognise the real when it was
handed out to them and frantically asked for
more. Edwardes reckons that “The Sing-
ing' .Soldiers” which recently appeared in
The Bulletin will make any town in Aus-
tralia sit up.
On Christmas Night at Melbourne Royal
an impressive songstress took part in Wal-
ter Kirby’s concert. Miss Lena Kingston,
the debutante, has all the style and the voice
of an Italian operatic prima-donna, though
she was billed as a “lyric soprano,” which
suggests a ballad singer. Nervousness
seemed to prevent the tall, robust Australian
girl from letting herself go for all she is
worth ; but undoubtedly she is the beginnings
of a grand-opera star.

sented at the Front and in the training

fession: Hugh Buckler, Harcourt Beatty,

Norway made another stride along the road
to Socialism the other day when it decided
to take over all the flicker theatres in the
country. All the licenses of the present
theatres expire early in 1916, and the Gov-
ernment will then become the sole purveyor
of flicker and the sole custodian of reel
profits.
“Rab Cilbup”: No doubt it is because
Australian audiences are long-suffering; but
isn’t it time that the Firm gave a little
more entertainment for the price of a
theatre ticket? Nowadays, no matter how
short a play may be, it is made to fill out
a full evening ; the management evens mat-
ters up by starting late and increasing the
length of the intervals. In “Twin Beds” one
interval stretched to 20 minutes on the open-
ing night; and instead of putting on a one-
act play to fill up, the Firm has got into
the habit of asking the gallery to provide
the amusement before 8.15, or thereabouts,
when the curtain goes up. On first nights
the gallery fills in the time it has paid for
by cheering and applauding every theatrical
celebrity’s entrance into the stalls. On
other nights there is nothing for it but to
wait patiently for the end of an over-long
overture.
“Monkbarns”: The Melbourne Royal, in
60 years of life, has had over 40 Christmas
pantomimes. The most artistic was Barry
Sullivan’s “Lalla Rookh,” in 1863, the cast
including Young and Stewart alternately,
Lambert, Harwood, Rose Edouin and Tilly
Earl, with a double harlequinade by the
Edouins and Leopolds. The most patriotic,
in a Victorian sense, was by Akhurst, “The
House that Jack- Built, or Jack Melbourne
and Little Victoria.” in 1869. Jack was
Johnny Fawkner, and Melbourne the House
he Built. Harwood played Jack, and Mag-
gie Stewart, Nellie’s sister, was Victoria.
To this Hennings contributed an elaborate
panorama of the growth of Melbourne.
“Ninety Years Old” : If your constant con-
troversialist is the man I take him to be, this
is an abridged version of his record: —
Harrison Owen, at the age of six months, played
the stolen child in “A Humble Mother’s Crime,” at
Sadler’s Wells Theatre. When not acting or rehearsing
for child-parts he utilised his spare time learning
Shakspeare and step-dancing. He moved to London
while still a boy, and played Hamlet in 1874 with
tremendous success. The London critics, who had
been upset by Henry Irving’s unconventional version
of the part at the Lyceum, hailed Owen as the
deliverer of Art ; but English prejudice proved
too strong, and Owen travelled London with a barrel-
organ and a monkey until he was able to buy an
interest in a small circus. It was not long before
he owned the circus. After travelling the United
Kingdom, and accumulating much valuable know-
ledge, he drifted into the music-halls as a lion
comique, and subsequently sent London wild by his
performances in pantomime. Followed a period of
stock-company work, which, though unprofitable
financially, won him the esteem and respect of the
profession. His deep study of the theatre had by
this time become recognised, and Ibsen frequently
sought his advice, sometimes telegraphing for it.
Ruskin used to visit him late at night, and history
will probably reveal the fact that Whistler was
merely Owen's mouthpiece. What little leisure he
had was devoted to Continental criticism. Wagner
derived much inspiration from him, and he recon-
structed much Teutonic folk-lore. Owen’s articles
in the reviews on the English stage helped to form
English taste, and have since provided numberless
writers of text-books with material. The foundations
of his fortune were laid about this time, for his
exuberant vitality craved some outlet, and he found
it in management. It is said of him that he knew
his public and his players so well that he never
, made a mistake. His interminable list of successes
(all of them gained behind the backs of other men
whom he directed) are practically a record of the
modern English stage. He touched everything, and
everybody touched him. In his time he produced,
stage-managed and acted everything from Hamlet to
Little Willy and the Worst Woman in Wycheproof.
Now, having made all the money he is likely to
need, he is giving Australia the benefit of his enor-
mous experience. It pains me to see such a man
contradicted by other contributors who have merely
been on the stage or made a study of it.
“Van Eck”: About that par. (B.
30/12/T5) concerning Ida Barr. I
heard a better one. Two small boys were
standing outside the Tiv. looking over the
pliptos. The eyes of one alighted on the
massive lady. “ Tde a Barr,” he com-
mented rudely. “She’d ’ide a pub.”
“Jwosp” : No one can complain about the
slowness of Australian George H. Clutsam.
His Jatest is to compose and publish a book
of 25 short pieces for use by moving-picture
orchestras. The various sections are entitled
“Light and Ordinary Comedy Scenes” ; “Pro-
cessional Marches” ; “Religious and Oriental
Sentiment,” and so on. Thus the lone piano-
pounder in the picture-show can readily get
what he wants. This is the first music I
have heard of actually set to the flicker of
the reeling films. A.
Grace Bros, are presenting three valuable
scholarships to Ma’s *neW State Conserva-
torium of Music. The competitions will be
held at the Grace stores in Sydney on dates
to be fixed by the Director, and the closing
day for all entries will be February 20. The
candidates will be judged by musicians nomi-
nated by Verbrugghen, who will personally
supervise the final stages. Three scholar-
ships are offered —for singing, piano and
violin. Each scholarship-holder will receive
tuition in the subject competed for, with the
full benefits of the Conservatorium, for 12
months. These are the first scholarships
given to the Conservatorium by private indi-
viduals, and it is hoped many wealthy citi-
zens will follow the Graces’ generous lead
and thus help poor but musical youngsters on
to glory. *

One of life’s little ironies marked the

“It.B.”: If Australia wants to save its
average and not deport all good Australians
to the firing-line, conscription should come
quickly. It should be conscription with
modifications, drafts being made in this
order: —•
(1) All the English born and immigrants who are
tilling the jobs of Australians on active service.
(2) All flagwaggers, mad optimists, mayors and
■other self-advertisers who find limelight by advising
others to enlist while staying at home themselves,
and all Freetraders whose ridiculous policy gave Ger-
many the money to fight with.
(3) All wowsers and such people as preach con-
tinuous prayer when the real need is continuous
ammunition.
(4) Ordinary Australians.
With such an arrangement the war will not
prove all evil, whichever way it goes.

It looks as if things are not right even
yet. An Australian artist, now a corporal
in the Australian army, writes from the
Mediterranean: —
We’ve a rotten postal service; half our parcels
are stolen in transit. And as for Red Cross funds
or presents, they are like Casabianca after the acci-
dent. Somebody ought to be shot for misappropri-
ation of Red Cross stuff. I was in hospital a week
at Mena, and they couldn’t give anyone in my
ward pyjamas, though enough were sent to fill a
fleet. We have bought stuff with tickets from donors
in the pockets. Up to date my gifts from home
amount to one small plug of tobacco, although 100
cigarettes are sent weekly. Some of these interveners
are mean enough to pinch the pennies off a dead
man’s eyes. Have we still got a Postmaster-General
in Australia, or has the job been handed over to
Adela Pankhurst and the Peace Society?

“Enzedder” : Re “Bad
Australian’s” par. (B.
9/12/’l5) about the
insincere politeness of
the South American.
This characteristic
often causes trouble
with foreigners, who
do not understand it.
I should not call it
insincerity any more
than I should accuse
a correspondent of be-
ing insincere because,
while muttering “Why
the devil does this fel-
low worry me with
his letters?” he starts
with “Dear sir,” and
says he has “the
honor of replying to
your esteemed com-
munication” and
winds up “yours very
tr u 1 y.” They are
merely forms of polite-
ness. Thus, accord-
ing to the Spanish and
South American code
o f politeness, one
should never eat even
peanuts in company
without first offering
them to everyone pre-
sent, in a general way,
by saying “Would you
like some?” Natur-
ally you are expected
to say no and to wish
that he may enjoy
them. If you admire
anything belonging to
mm he will offer it to
you. You refuse it,
not because you don’t
like it, but because it
could suit no one so
well as the owner,
be in better hands. When C °n<? d 1°? *"

Long Bay Penitentiary, the woman’s part
of it, has unearthed a record-breaking duck-
breeder—a woman who has reared 70 with-
out a single casualty. Working on the idea
that over-indulgence in water is the cause of
most fatalities, she devised a contrivance by
which the birds could obtain a drink without
getting wet outside. This record-holder is a
result of the new system of putting N. S.
Wales prisoners to all sorts of labor, and
other results are giving the authorities a
certain measure of pride. This particular
woman, who is a well-behaved prisoner, is a
guest through a fixed propensity for disap-
pearing with somebody else’s horse. It was,
with her, a rural form of shop-lifting.
Even in Melbourne the Peace people are
c fbeir little wars. Charles Strong,
oi the Australian Church, chief priest of
the leace movement in Victoria, has made
public that the Peace Society is not the

Society doesn t endorse the views nor ap-
prove the actions of that Army. Dr. Strong

I’d often read of rapid love in books,
Of passion blazing with a lightning rush,
Of throbbing pulses, tears and burning looks,
But always put it down as silly mush.
But when I read of drear Gallipoli,
Its shrapnel balls, and torn and dying men,
And fierce Turks gaunt and grinning evilly—
By George, a tide of love flowed o’er me then t
I wasn't sure at first for whom it Sowed, •
But when I read again of kukris bright
Flashing in bloodstained fists, I crossed the road
And told my love to Mabel Brown that night.
I’m married now and manfully resist
My selfish longings for a soldier’s lot;
But as for single men who won’t enlist,
I’d have the cows all gathered in and shot.

“The Oldest Inhabitant” at the sale of
another pub:—
A couple of weeks ago a firm of Sydney salesmen
offered the S.E. corner of King and George streets ;
but the property was passed in without enticing a
bid. Since then, however, Belfield’s Hotel and the
shops attached have changed hands at £112,500.
The estate has been in the Hutchinson family for
nearly a century. The original Hutchinson lived on
the site. When attorney Moore cut up and sold
what is now Waters’s corner, opposite, Hutchinson
built himself a house at the junction of Pitt and
Campbell streets, and let the King and George
streets house to Woolley, an ironmonger. The hotel
came later. One time the Union Bank thought of
having its head office there. It did business on the
block for a while, but crossed the street and settled
its headquarters more comfortably in Pitt-street.
Taking the George-street frontage (69ft.) as a basis,
the recent sale means £1630 a foot, with the old
buildings given in. Another estate with a history

properties to pay off the debt he had incurred in
connection with the Australian College. In the
ancient house on the corner of Bathurst and Kent
streets one time lived a Lieut.-Gov. of N. S. Wales
and Tasmania—Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass, a distin-
guished Peninsular soldier, whose great-grandson
(Russell Clarke, M.L.C.), a step-brother of Baronet
Rupert, has just enlisted in Melbourne.
IN HIS LINE.
MISS GOLDSTEIN (the hanker's daughter): “Don'd my chatter veary you, Mr. Grabben-
heimer?”
GRABRENHEIMER (rapturously): “I could listen to your vords all day mit compound
inderest!”
Australian bankers say that a good deal
of loose gold has been stowed away in stock-
ings and old teapots
and holes in the ground
since the outbreak of
the war. Tory abuse
of the national bank
and our Federal note
system probably ac-
counts for two-thirds
of the common yearn-
ing to hang on to metal
money ; the other third
arises from the horror
timid people felt about
the prospect of having
to run out into the
world away from a
German invasion with-
out a sovereign in their
pockets. One of these
misguided dames, a St.
Kilda (Vic.) house-
keeper, is now lament-
ing her lack of faith.
She went downstairs
at the shrill call of
the servant the other
morning to discover
that a burgling sur-
prise party had been
on the job over night,
and had taken a large
helping of the big
plum pudding in the
cupboard. The plum
pudding was, in fact,
her bank, and had
been built and baked
round 50 sovereigns.
And the poor woman
had omitted to make it
burglar-proof.
“Pick”: I wonder why railway men, so
prone to kick when things are not going
their way, have never got busy on the plain-
axled tricycle? Three classes of permanent-
way men are required daily to traverse given
lengths of the road. The inspector skims
along on a motor-driven trike, capable of
carrying at least three men. The gangei
pulls a hand-machine fitted with roller-bear-
ings. But the numerous fettler has to snag
through his length with the time-dishonored,
heart-straining, plain-axled machine. He
knows the foolish waste of time and energy
occasioned by the arrangement, but as he
toils along the up-grades of his stretch in
the Commissioner’s time, I suppose he
reckons the loss is not his funeial. It isn t,
when you come to think of it.
“O.Iv.”: The conscriptive compromise of
the Asquith Government seems a well-merited
slur upon the “knut.” Not the absurdly
audacious and resourceful knut of musical-
comedy who has money and time to burn
and is always rushing after adventure, but
the feeble, imitative knut who lives only
for week-ending—-the knut of the city office,
warehouse or shop. His personality is
bounded by long hair at one en<J and con-
spicuous socks at the other. His mind ;s
in his shoes, his necktie expresses the yearn-
ings of his soul. Nothing short of compulsion
could ever make a soldier of Bertie. Wise
public opinion disapproves of one sort of
slacker being singled out for special legisla-
tion; but if a shocking example is to be
made of any sort, the knut should be It.
With very few exceptions he is not a muni-
tions-factory worker, nor a railway worker,
nor any kind of worker who wouldn’t be
more serviceable at the Front than in a com-
mercial centre. He is mostly better grown
"AND THE MOUNTAINS SKIPPED
LIKE RAMS, AND THE LITTLE HILLS
LIKE YOUNG SHEEP.”
(i.e., better fed from infancy) and much
more in need of toughening than the harder
toilers. To be dragged from an admiring con-
templation of his demoralising ideal, which
is the knut of musical comedy, and to be
trained and disciplined for the firing-line, is
just what Bertie needs ; and it is just what
Bertie is now going to get.

“Ivaree” meets some old friends: —
I cordialled the other day with the French Chas-
seurs d’Afrique, in which I served at the time Cap-
tain Joe Lalor was a sergeant in the 2nd Foreign
Legion. A good few of these sun-baked, broad-
shouldered Algerian cookies and graziers will be
trying Australia after the war, and good luck to
them 1 They’ve shown our boys that good riding
isn’t an Australian monopoly. The cavalry does not
believe in transports, deeming such thing 3 as tents,
for instance, superfluous, and the officers rough it
on the same tucker and accommodation as their
men. Our small-arms factory could take a hint
from them anent slings, which are fixed on the side
instead of in front of the body of the rifle, so that,
when slung, the rifle lies flat on their back, instead
of having a magazine and trigger-guard digging in
their spine, as with ours. The rifle, when its owner
is mounted, is, further, held motionless by the small
of the butt fitting in a circular spring on the belt,
which prevents it from getting round your chest,
as with us. Though hard cases, you never see any
of the men drunk, looting or maltreating harmless
nigs. Another trait in common with us is that, in
their opinion, one colonial is worth 10 of the
“home”-grown article at anything.

“Tambellup” encounters the cheerful
casual Australian in Flanders: —
He’s a private in my company, and this morning
I met him as I was wading knee deep through my
section of trenches. He was also knee deep standing
in front of his dug-out (raised on piles) shaving.
I greeted him; “Hullo, Stalker! Shaving?”
“Yessir,” he said, and added most politely, “but if
you don’t mind, sir, you’re standing in my shaving
water.”

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Eumaralla,
offered on certain terms as a settlement area
for soldiers by H. R. Denison, of Sydney,
was originally known as Guntawang, and had
been in the Rouse family for three-quarters
of a century, having been granted to Edwin
of that ilk in 1825. In the early
’2o’s, when Cox and Lawson settled
Mudgee, Guntawang was formed and
had on it a ferocious tribe of blacks,
so treacherous that the whites • had to
abandon it. War to the knife was declared,
and within one week seven white men fell
victims to the black man’s vengeance. . How
many natives were massacred in retaliation
it is impossible to say, but neither men,
women nor children were spared in the
slaughter that took place. The Mudgee
country was discovered by explorer Lawson,
whose grandson, J. B. Bettington, died last
week. The brothers George and Henry Cox,
sons of the pioneer William, were the
first to settle at Mudgee. As in honor bound
they gave Lawson choice of country. They
were followed by Robert Lowe at Wilbertree,
Edwin Rouse of Guntawang, William Bow-
man of Tannabatta, and William Hayes on
Lawson Creek. After the Coxes abandoned
Guntawang they formed another station at
Dabee, where they flourished. When George
Cox travelled his sheep from Bathurst, to
Mudgee he was accompanied by William
Lee, grandfather of Ida Lee (Mrs. Marriott),
the historian of early days. . The
original Rouse came out as an immigrant
in the first days of last century; he was. a
special constable at the Hawkesbury and in
charge of public buildings. A friend of
Bligh, he was named by that Governor as a
witness in the court-martial of Colonel
Johnston.

“Two Seas”: The record put up by the
Victorian Dept, of Health (B. 2/12/’l5) in
taking nearly five years to acknowledge the
receipt of an application is
nothing much in the way ot
official gradualness. On May 9,.
1872, a selector down south,
having “done his sentence,”
paid up the balance due on his
conditional purchase and ap-.
plied to the N.S.W. Lands
Dept, for the Crown grant. He
waited five years and then died.
After the old man’s death the
widow opened up correspondence
with “her obedient servant” in
charge of the red tape and kept
it going till she joined her hus-
band in the New. Selection. The
Department still went on
gravely informing her family in
a beautiful copybook hand, on
expensive paper, that “the grant
would issue in due course,” and
that it still “had the honor to
remain,” etc. The years rolled
wearily on until 1905, and then
a descendant of the man who
applied for the grant in 1872
was put wise. He sent in his
application through an agent, who obtained
the long-prayed-for grant in a fortnight.
This may not be a record, but it seems to
knock out the Victorian claim for champion-
ship honors.

The recent loss of the oil steamer Norcl
off Cape Pillar has stirred the Federal Gov-
ernment to put a wireless station on the
nearby Tasman Islet, which has so far been
one of the very few places in the world
depending on pigeon post for communica-
tion with the outside world. Tasman
Island is a mass of rock rising sheer out of
the sea to a height of 1000 ft., and its only,
object in life thus far seems to be to wrec*
ships. .S

WHAT MAKES THE WHEELS
PERsONAL
ITEMs
The retirement of E. F. Pittman, N.S.W.
Fnder-Secretary for Mines, has meant that
tardy justice has been done to J. E. Carne,
who has been appointed Government Geolo-
gist. Pittman, when he got his Under-Secre-
taryship some years ago, managed to tack
on to it the job of Government Geologist,
though it wasn’t possible for one man to fill
both billets decently. Carne has been assist-
ant geologist in name and Government
Geologist in reality for 14 years, and has
contributed some invaluable work on rocky
subjects, in the reflected light of M’hich Pitt-
man has been able to shine. The retired
Under-Secretary didn’t receive any emolu-
ments for the work that he didn’t do; but
that he should have the title and take the
kudos has always been a cause of irritation.
Minister Estell gave Carne the honor and
the glory the day Pittman left the depart-
ment, but he should have done it many days
earlier.

Chanter, Labor M.P. for the Ivivorina,
can’t go to the war himself, but he is well
represented there. lie has. two sons one
recently promoted to captain—ll nephews
and two grandsons with the forces; and two
nieces are nurses. Another grandson is on

himself girds at the weight of years that

“Trot” : So George Iteid is going to remain
in the Cold Country and “become an active
figure in Imperial politics.” As Imperial
politics mostly consist of eating and making
remarks across the ravished food, George
should still be able to keep the waiters on the
run. Yet it looks as if he was weakening in
his loyalty by this determination to stay hard
at work holding post-mortems over the
pheasant. Think of the mighty influence he
could be for welding the bonds here in Aus-
tralia by taking a turn in the recruiting cir-
cus. Good old George mounted on a lorry
at the head of a patriotic procession through
Melbourne ; George delivering short addresses
at street corners on “Feeds that Won the
Empire”; George at the head of “The Native
Bears” on an empire-saving tramp from
Bourke to. Sydney, via Darwin; George try-
ing on pyjamas at sewing meetings; George
in khaki; Qeorge under canvas; George dig-
ging a trench; George at the farewell to a
com' cocky—George all over the blessed
place pursued by 17 reporters, 45 photogra-
phers, 12 cooks and a bottle-holder. We
want the personal lead, the magnetic touch,
a firing of the national imagination. * Why

Russell Clarke, M.L.C. (Vic.), who has
enlisted, despite his 39 years and his wife
and three children, has some good fighting
blood in him. He is a son of the late
Baronet Clarke by his second wife, who was
a daughter of Peter Snodgrass, w'hose father
was Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass, one-time
Commandant of the troops in Australia and
an acting-Governor of two colonies—N. S.
Wales and Van Diemen’s Land. The
Colonel served in the Peninsular War under
Wellington, and led the forlorn hope at San
Sebastian, in which he was badly wounded.
He got a special pension by reason of the
and died at Raymond Terrace
(A.S.W.) m 1853. Peter showed-pluck as
a youngster in a scrap with bushrangers on

maintained the family fire-eating tradition bv
shooting first the lady and then himself.

he died and was almost an Australian,
having been brought hither from Britain
when a 13-year-old. But liis surroundings
at Marsh-where the lucerne
grows 3ft. above ground and 30ft uuclcr
lieath—were not conducive to the de/dop
ment of any but the most Tory ideas. Lat-
terlv the family paper had been kept going

inal head of the concern.
Just dead in Melbourne, Henry Wolfe,
a member of the Stock Exchange fiom its
birth. He arrived in Melbourne from Lon-
don GO years ago, and was 27 then which
made his total run about S 7 years. He was
the senior partner of the firm of Gavin G.
Brown & Co., but owing to failing health
had not taken any active interest in the
business nor his seat in the callroom of late
years.
Governor Galway’s tongue has got him in
trouble again in Adelaide. Last time it was
about the Northern Territory; this time
about the Islington (railway) workshop
men. The latter marched to Parliament
House in a body to ask for higher wages.
The Governor said that “well-paid and intel-
ligent men,” wdio took “such action when the
Empire was in danger,” would be the better
for being “under khaki and discipline. He
had,” lie went on. ' “never seen a
finer body. They would have made
a splendid battalion. They had every
aspect of manliness and virility to
look at, but their minds were crooked.”
Labor called on him to apologise. He de-
clined. Ministers pointed out that he had
“overstepped the line which marks the limit
of gubernatorial privilege.” He replied that,
having meant only to condemn any action
contrary to patriotic spirit, he (1) “in no
sense criticised either the policy of Ministers
or what may fairly be termed State affairs;
but (2) would never have expressed himself
in public on the matter had he been aware
that his words would be construed by Minis-
ters as a departure from long-established pre-
cedent.” Then Vaughan regretted that Min-
isters are “unable to assent” to argument
No. 1; but “accept the assurance” (which is
practically an apology) contained in No. 2.
THEN WHY FIGHT?

The echo of a sensation that shook up the
district around Palmerston North (M.L.) a
few years back reached the Supreme Court
recently when Hannah Pawelka applied for
a divorce from Joseph Pawelka. It was in
February, 1910, that Joe, who was a butcher
in his hours of ease, committed
a number of small thefts, bailed
up several people and then took
to leaping around the landscape
pursued by a palpitating police
force. . Eventually the whole
population of Palmerston was
rushing about with guns and
carving-knives, and several in-
offensive citizens who happened
to be mistaken for Pawelka were
shot dead before being identified
as someone else, and a John Hop
was slain in his tracks. Finally
Joe was captured in a cow-
shed and handed 21 years' hard
labor by a demented person in a
wig, whereupon he leaped out of
gaol through a keyhole or somc-
„T thing and dissolved into thin air.
\\ here he is only Joe knows, and Joe
naturally won't tell. So Hannah got the
decree she wanted and Joe the freedom to
get married again to anyone who wants to
live an unquiet life.

THE OLD LEAF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
On New Year’s Eve I tinned the old leaf over
The soiled and faded leaf I know so well
Which first I turned when first 1 was a lover,
Vowing on highest moral heights to dwell
And live a goodly life.
The old resolves there stated brought to mind
A dozen “reformations’’ in the past —
Poor weak resolves, all deeply underlined,
So quickly shaped, but never made to last!
And each was as a knife
That stabbed my conscience, for each point was
keen,
And drew the blood of vain regret once more.
I pictured me the saint 1 might have been
Had I not turned to what I was before,
ily conscience cried with pain ;
And so, remarking that as life proceeds
Time gives one cause enough for futile grief,
Without repentance for one’s sweet misdeeds,
l closed my eyes against the well-thumbed leaf
And turned it back again.
No ghosts of dead resolves shall haunt me now,
No resurrected aspirations mock my will,
No fancied echo of a far-off vow
Uttered upon the summit of a hill
Disturb my latter days.
I am content to pay for what I had
Of dainty dishes at the festive board ;
If memories of Vice make sinners glad,
Why then, like Virtue, ’tis its own reward.
To walk in pleasant ways
When I could find them, giving passing heed
To traps and pitfalls as 1 strolled along,
lias been my custom. And 1 felt no need
For nice distinctions between right and wrong,
Nor for a fixed belief
Concerning things whereof the wowsers speak
With little wisdom and with less of wit.
The Truths that no man knows I will not seek.
I will not add a line to what is writ
Upon the turned-back leaf.

ASQUITH THE UNREADY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It has been a case of too late and too little.
•—Pall Mall Gazette.
“Too late and too little” ! The motto will stick.
Insufficiently large, insufficiently quick,
Are the dealings of Asquith with national needs;
But he makes up in words for his weakness of deeds.
He watches and waits for the ills that arrive;
He regTets that the dead are no longer alive;
And because he has made a damn mess of the Past
He expects to lead Britain to triumph at last.
Slow Asquith, the lawyer, in eloquence strong
Is piling up costs as the case drags along.
His sins of omission he lays on the shelf,
And flings with his tongue a bouquet at himself.
“Too late and too little” ! The motto will hold
Till Britain turn Asquith adrift in the cold.
Then the voice of the sluggard will surely complain :
“You have waked up too soon; let me dope you
again.”
VICTORIA.

About the only thing wrong with this insti-

to be amalgamated with the Commonwealth

agencies for carrying on this class of busi-
ness. That would mean a saving of expense
—or ought to mean it. Apart from the fact
that it is superfluous, and that S. Aus.

of three State hanks where one should serve,
little but good can be said about it. And its
merits are appreciated. “Estimating the

441,690, the proportion of depositors to popu-
lation was 56 in every 100 persons.” Pro-
bably no other State in the world can pro-
duce such a certificate of thrift. N. S.
Wales is fairly keen on its savings-bank de-
posits, yet in proportion to population Ma
lias only 614 depositors for every 1000 there
are in S. Australia.
Last year saw a setback. After increasing
year by year the total of deposits actually
shrank —that is to say, withdrawals exceeded
the deposits. Here are the aggregate
deposit figures:—
1906 .. £4,750,192 1911 .. £7,411,710
1907 .. 6,304,704 1912 .. 8,223,260
1908 .. 6,803,301 1913 .. 8,608,478
1909 .. 6,328,870 1914 .. 9,018,837
1910 .. 6,771,150 1915 .. 9,017,061
This £9,017,061 constitutes the capital of the
bank. The only other funds are reserves,
amounting to £284,476, and a small fund
held in trust for the benefit of retiring
officers. Whether reserves are sufficiently
large does not depend so much on the size of
deposits and other borrowed money as on
the use made of that money. If, for in-
stance, you took the deposits and locked them
up in a safe, it wouldn’t be necessary to hold
a reserve to protect them. All you would
want in that case would be a gun. Here the
bank’s funds are employed as follows:
Mortgages .. .. £2,129,965 = 22.7 p.c.
Public securities .. 5,754,487 = 61.3 p.c.
Premises .. .. 81,576 = .9 p.c.
Cash, deposits, etc... 1,421,085 = 15.1 p.c.
The public has to modify its views about
Government securities. When Consols get
down well towards half of their face value,
plainly you can’t afford to look upon them
as unshrinkable. This bank has public stock
—nearly all, of course, S. Australian—-of a
face value of £5,723,875, but now written
down to £5,539,745. How much that is
above market value we don’t know. Pro-
bably a great deal. The hope of the bank is
that it won’t have to sell any of these securi-
ties until the world settles down and the
market recovers. Only about £1,500,000 of
the public’s £9,017,061 is invested or kept
apart from these shrinkable stocks and mort-
gages ; and those figures suggest that the pre-
sent reserves are inadequate. Certainly the
depositors don’t run the smallest risk, for
the whole State stands behind the bank, and
the millionaire guarantees the repayment of
the smallest kid’s copper, deposited in the
penny bank run in connection with 452
schools. But no bank ever wants to fall
back on such a guarantee. Every bank wants
to feel that it can face any crisis which a
prudent bank ought to provide for. This
paper doesn’t believe, in view of the fact
de P asits are practically at call, and
that the bank must (in theory, at any rate)
be prepared to sell its securities, that a
reserve of is sufficient to safeguard
nearly £8,000,000 of risks. This is another
way of saying that there has not been suffi-
cient margin between revenue and expendi-
ture —not sufficient between the interest
allowed and interest charged. Another pos-
sible explanation is that exes, are, or have
been, too heavy; but that can be ruled out

This has been a world of fleeting change aH
right for Edward Rich and E, Rich*ind Co
Ltd From very modest beginnings out m
the mK of N. S. Whies Edward Rich
built up a fine business, and then came to
town. It would have been all right if he had
left a steady 12in. or 15m. ramfall
him; but there came drought i nstead ; a “ d
rabbits, and new people wl ?o knew no
Edward Rich; so the time arrived when Hie
co. was practically taken over by L alg y -
London office. But the Australian capacity
for bobbing up stood by the reputable old
house, and six years or so back R icb a ? d
Co. shook itself free again and set up its
head office in Sydney. But when a co. has
been in the backwater for a good many years
it has a big job ahead of it when it resumes
the vovage. Most of its men seem too old,
and naturally the brightest youngsters
haven’t come to that sort of concern, and
there are weeds and barnacles everywhere.
So it was with this co. But at length Edward
Rich died, and the Brisbane manager -was
brought to Sydney and made managing
director in his place; and he seems to have
soon decided that the quicker they went into
new country the better. The business in
N. S. Wales has thus been steadily liqui-
dated, and now “the co.’s interests in Sydney
are confined to the collection of certain
p.n.’s as they fall due and the working of
the bonded and free stores at Circular Quay,
which are beginning to be fully utilised and
are giving a good return.” William McMil-
lan, of Sydney, who has been chairman, has
gone off the Board; and the management
has been shifted to Brisbane. For all prac-
tical purposes it is to be in future a Queens-
land co.
The realisation of the N. S. Wales stock
has put the co. in a good financial position.
Even as late as four years ago it owed about
£BO,OOO. To-day it owes under £20,000, and
has £28,000 in cash. The co. is proceeding
now to employ its resources, and makes a
start with a branch at Goondiwindi. Capital
is £198,037; but £59,767 of that is in free-
holds and plant. The balance, apart from
the cash before mentioned, is made up
chiefly of stock (£56,588) and book debts
(£88,680) —the latter a lot of money; but
the average cocky, big and little alike, looks
for 12 months’ credit just as he
looks for breakfast. And the fact that lie
commonly pays 8 or 10 p.c. or more for it
doesn't seem to matter to him in the least.

On the. surface the history of this co, is a
little disappointing. For instance, go back
to the half-year with which the table starts.
The profit then was a few pounds more than
for. the past half-year; yet meantime the
capital has been increased from £lO,OOO to
£14,000, and the gross value of estates in
hand has gone from £523,459 to £1,710,732.
Though there has been a great increase in
business, the net earnings from commissions
that is, earnings less all office and adminis-
tration exes.—are only one-half of what they
were in 1908. There seems to be room for
inquiry here. At present the evidence points
to the charges not being high enough in
view of the special circumstances of the
West. That is, compared with charges else-
where. Putting other trustee offices aside,
this co. is doing very well. Even last year,
when it did not do as well as usual, it made
just on to 20 p.c. on its capital and 9 p.c.
on capital and reserves combined; and a co.
which can do that, while risking nobody else’s
money, and having about 19-20ths of its
own funds in city premises, public securities
and selected mortgages, may very well con-
sider itself fortunate. And it may well con-
sider itself doubly fortunate in view of its
excellent prospects of a continually-growing
business.

The figures don’t tend towards larger profits

the much higher interest paid by the Gov-

really isn’t much private demand for money
at high rates; and the banks haven t the

get money. But if the figures don t favor
greater profits they at least indicate greater
strength. The bank owes altogether
£716,160, and it has £334,158 in hand,
almost all cash and balances. So it could
pav 47 p.c. of its liabilities out of its liquid
assets, and it has £665,910 of other assets
to pay the £382,002 of other debt. In
normal times, in view of the new capital,
the bank could safely take another £200,000
of deposits and employ most of them.

On the face of it it looks a rather aston-
ishing thing that a comparatively small co.
like this should increase its reserves from
£69,000 to £lOB,OOO without distributing
profits. The explanation lies in the co.’s
heavy liabilities. The sundry creditors
item, chiefly bank overdraft, has moved as
follows: —-
Sept., 1910 .. £45,112 Sept., 1913 .. £70,958

Sept., 1912 .. 72,276 Sept., 1915 .. 65,188
Mar., 1913 .. 65,836
Stocks were piled up at a time when labor
and other costs were exceptionally high, and
debt was incurred in consequence. The
policy seemed to this paper very doubtful,
if not wrong. Had the construction boom
stopped when the war started, as it should
have done, this co. would have been in seri-
ous difficulties. However, borrowing for
works continued in the face of the urgent
loan requirements of the Empire for war
purposes. It was an ill wind; but it blew
this co. a mile or two off a dangerous lee-
shore. Six months ago stocks on hand were
\alued at £155,423. They have now been
reduced to £106,737; hence the fine slice
which has been carved off the liabilities, as
shown above. But the stock is still too
heavy, and the directors seem to realise it.
They say _ they “have continued the policy
ol restricting purchases, and whatever stock
has been added was contracted for before
the war” ; wherefore, they add, it “will yield
more than the ordinary rate of profit when
disposed of.” Incorrigible optimists, these
people. It no doubt would if it were dis-
posed of promptly; but there is going to be
a horribly cold time for the building trades
before long, because those trades are sup-
ported more than almost any other on the
proceeds of loans, and when we have finished
our war drunk loans are going to be museum
exhibits for a while. Hence the urgency in
this case of reducing purchases and working
stocks down. Certainly they say they ar!
doing it; but note that, though stocks on
hand are nearly £50,000 less than they were
a half-year ago, “advances on account of
a O /e e5 £53240 S v,* a n d - log timber in transit ’’
are £03,249, which is actually more than
the total of March last.

That’s a pretty bad cut; but the directors’
explanation is ample—“ The output of both
Melbourne and Sydney factories has shown
a falling-off; and the greatly-increased cost
of raw material owing to the war and the
ever-increasing wages bill have had their
effect upon the profits.” The Bulletin
doesn’t know about the wages bill, but the
other two ills are transitory. The demand
for Australian-made goods is certainly going
to improve after the war, primarily because
what our fellows have done has squeezed
some more of the life out of the stupid
idea that Australians couldn’t do much;
and the cost of paper will fall as soon as
there is no more trouble in the North Sea
and the mill-hands are released from war
service and freights become reasonable
again. The year’s figures can therefore be
dismissed as abnormal. The co.’s financial
position is quite as good as it was 12 months
ago. Capital remains at the old £37.200,
and liabilities are £7311, as against £BBi3.
Assets are as follows: —
1910. 1914. 1915.
Premises .. £4,604 £11,184 £11,252
Plant .. 10,244 14,193 13,498
Stock .. 6,833 11,166 10,755
Book debts .. 6,029 8,056 7,694
That accounts for £35,888 of the capital
after providing for liabilities. There is the
usual trading risk about the investment, no
doubt; but, besides giving a nice profit, there
is a lot more of the capital showing than is
visible in a great many “industrials.”

“D.F.”: The remarks of “F.I. J.” about
the Commonwealth Government’s oil con-
tracts (B. 10/12/15) are a little off the rails,
although his principles are sound enough.
The Commonwealth has not got contracts
running for the supply of Yankee oil for the
Australian Navy at 90s. and 955. per ton,
though it may have bought some Yankee oil
at these rates for our ships on service
overseas. The Defence Department’s con-
tracts for oil supply are for fuel-oil from
the Dutch East Indies, and the rates are, or
were, slightly less than those quoted by
“F.1.J.” Perhaps the suppliers would reduce
those rates if they thought local competition
was coming along. Anyway, the original
price at which Navy Minister Jensen offered
a contract to the Tasmanian State Govern-
ment for shale-oil from Latrobe was a long
way below £4 per ton; it has gone up a
little since but is still rather low. Jensen
offered to throw in the free use of the Com-
monwealth oil-ship, when it had nothing else
to do, as a makeweight to help the State
Government along. The Tas. Government
is now negotiating with the holders of 1488
acres of the best of this shale country, and
has put a Parliamentary Committee on to
inquire into the proposed purchase. Dr.
Wade reported some months ago that this
area contains, on a conservative estimate,
5,500,000 tons of shale. If this yields
on an average 40 gallons of crude oil per
ton (and in actual practice the co. now
working the property has got 43 gallons),
this would mean 220,000,000 gallons, or just
under 1,000,000 tons, of oil. Government
Geologist Twelvetrees, who is usually very
careful, reckons the total quantity of shale
on the field at 12,000,000 tons, so there ought
to be something like 500,000,000 gallons of
oil there. Even if there is not profit enough
in the crude oil to give a big return, some of
the by-products ought to help the thing along.
Ihe preient co. turns out a fair amount of
the oil used for spraying fruit-trees and gets
a good long price for it, and also produces
motor-spmt on which the chairman of direc-
tors says he has run his car about 25.000
miles. As Australia spends a million or two
a jeai on imported oils, there is a big enough
market waiting.

ALUMIN0FERR1C is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-
ment, and many country Water Boards and graziers
for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

An extract from the Review, an Australasian jour-
nal of banking, insurance and finance: “It is beyond
question that the amount of new business —upwards
of £430,000 —secured by the Australian Provincial
Assurance Association for its third year of existence,
a year clouded by war and drought, is a record to
be proud of, and is certainly a good deal more than
we expected to see.... Any young insurance com-
pany “holding its own,” to use a well-understood
colloquial expression, during this time of stress and
strain, has much to be thankful for; but to be able
to show marked advance and undoubted progress at
such a time Is a matter for satisfaction and pride.
If there had been no war at all and no drought at
all this third report of the A.P.A., just as it is, would
have been deserving of high commendation, but that
such progress has been made in spite of these serious
drawbacks is nothing short of astonishing.... It is
but fair to add that this is not the opinion of critics
only, but also of some of the company’s rivals, both
older and younger. The A.P.A.’s report deals with
comparisons from first to last... .Expenditure is
faithfully given, and there is no more interesting
part than that showing expenditure actually less in
amount for the third year than for the second not-
withstanding the doubling of renewal premiums and
an increase of more than £100,000 in the new busi-
ness .... A very few years of such progress as has
been hitherto shown will place the Association in
a strong position.... From all we hear and know, the
business being done is of first-class quality.”— Advt.

“F.H.R.”: “Veritas” (B. 23/12/’l5) com-
ments on Pittman’s regime at the Mines De-
partment, which recalls the cast-iron rules
inspectors are bound by when asked to
recommend the granting of aid. We have a
shoot of stone (easily one of the best pros-
pecting shows in the New England district),
but it has dipped away north, leaving the
shaft at 30ft. to go down in blank ground
and troubled with water. Another shoot
of payable stone would come in from the
south in 50ft. of sinking; but when I asked
the inspector if he would recommend aid to
sink to 100 ft. he said that on account of the
line of reef having been worked to a greater
depth (200 ft.) some hundreds of yards away,
the Department would not grant it. It
seems there was no get-away from this rule
in Pittman’s time; but when the new man
is settled in his chair I’m going to put the
acid on him.
The re-shuffling of offices in the N. S.
Wales Mines Department consequent on the
retirement of Mr. Pittman as Under-Secre-
tary puts R. H. Cambidge at the top of the
tree and promotes Carne to the post of
Government Geologist. Mr. Cambidge has
long been Chief Surveyor ; he has high scien-
tific attainments; he knows every link in
the departmental chain, and will make a good
routine administrator and be popular
both in and out of the office. Carne has a
good record as a conscientious toiler in the
rock department, his name being familiar as
the author of several compendious compila-
tions on mines and mining in the State. A

Bendigo descensus! The 1915 figures of
yields, dividends and calls are the lowest in
the history of the field. The retrogression
lias been very rapid, and at no point on the
big field is there a prospect to inspire much
hope of a revival. The figures for the past
three years are: —
1913. 1914. 1915.
Gold, oz. .. 168,586 161,330 119,662
Dividends, £. . 135,116 125,849 62,587
Calls, £ . . 90,349 62,169 49,248
The falling-off in dividends of over 50 p.c.
between 1914 and 1915 is attributable to the
low position in the list of the Central Blue.
The most significant item is the decline in
calls. This means less prospecting work,
the fact being that there is _ little or no
encouragement for enterprise in this direc-
tion. Deep-mining—that is below 2500 ft. —
has been a conspicuous failure on every line
of reef. The side-lines, about which so much
is heard in times of adversity, have proved
patchy in gold contents. The Sheepshead
and Paddy’s gully lines have been the best
of them, but both are now very sick. It
needs no prophet’s eye to see Bendigo soon
following its old-time rival, Ballarat, in
being but a memory as a thriving field.
* * * *
The project for installing a series of
powerful electrical pumping plants on the
New Chum line at Bendigo, which was seri-
ously discussed a couple of years ago, seems
to have lapsed. The idea was to select (say)
three sites from which to drain the whole
line, and then prospect the deeper ground.
The Government approved and promised
substantial assistance, but in the present
impoverished state of the industry it is
doubtful whether the citizens could bear then-
share of the burden. From the Vic-
toria Consols to the Eureka, a distance of
about a mile and a half, there are 10 shafts
over 3000 ft. deep; viz., Victoria Consols,
3114 ft.; Ironbark, 3250 ft.; Victoria Quartz,
4614 ft.; Lansell’s 180, 3365 ft. ; N. C. 1 ic-
torih, 3579 ft.: Lazarus. 3682 ft.; N. C. Con-
sols, 3099 ft.; Shenandoah, 3182 ft.; N. C.
Railway, 4318 ft.; Eureka, 3060 ft. The
drivqge from these shafts must run into
hundreds of thousands of feet, and the best
evidence of failure is the fact that seven of
the 10 shafts are left without any equipment
whatever —not even tottering poppet-legs.
In these deep explorations it is a remark-
able fact that the best quality of ore was
found at the deepest points ; from 3000 down
to 4614 at Victoria Quartz to 4318 at N. C.
Railway the richest saddle formation was
the lowest. In both mines at about the
levels stated there are large bodies of stone
which at shallower levels could _be
worked at a good profit. Writer
some years ago saw the clean-up of. a
parcel of ore from the 4600 winze of the_ Vic-
toria Quartz which returned between Tdwt.
and Bdwt. per ton. The average yield from
the field’s six principal dividend-payers last
year was just 6dwt. per ton. But the deep
mines named could not be made to pay at
double or even treble that average. The
natural rock-heat is too great to permit of
men working more than six-hour shifts, and
the heat, combined with the foul atmosphere,
makes them incapable of doing as much work
in six hours as they could do in three hours
under more favorable conditions. The
shafts—l2ft. x 4ft. —are too small for any
practical purpose. If ever deeper explora-
tion is to be tackled in earnest it will mean
sinking new shafts and coupling up with
those now down, using the latter solely as
air-ways. But to sink 5000 ft. at the two
extreme points and provide the necessary
rapid-haulage equipment would mean a big
six-figure expense.
* * * *
The shockingly bad record for 1915,
combined with a new wages award increas-
ing the average rate by 25 p.c., has put the
Bendigo mine-owners in a blue funk. The
Bulletin is told that during the holidays
the principal owners have been assembled
in solemn conclave day after day to devise
means to meet the difficulty. It is reported
that absolute unanimity prevails. At the
outset it was decided that every mine should
, be put in the balance, and if found wanting
—that is, if with increased costs there was
no chance of its being made to pay and no
seeming hope of prospecting leading to any
good discovery—it should be abandoned for
the time being. A solidarity pledge was
exacted that each and all would abide by the
vote of the majority. By the time this par.
is in circulation the momentous decision in
this respect will be known on the field. There
will be much consternation. The confer-
ence has also considered the matter of im-
proved mining methods, having economy in
view. The one-man drill has not found favor
with the Bendigo miner, perhaps because
it is not a mate you can “argify” with —
and the average “Cousin” loves a verbal con-
test. This may be said without any impli-
cation that “argy-ing” means lessened work.
Quite the contrary is the recognised rule.
There is a story told about George Lansell
and Captain Arthur Pauli. The owner was
inspecting one of his mines, and nearing one
of the faces heard violent vociferation.
“What’s that horrible noise?” Lansell asked.
“The men are having a praying contest!”
replied the captain. “A praying contest!
How can they work and conduct themselves
like that? Sack them!” “No, boss;
mustn’t sack ’em. The harder they pray
the harder they work !” The determination
of the owners is said to be that wherever
practicable one-man drills are to be used.
As things have been, Bendigo working costs
have been brought down to a fine point, and
it is questionable whether any reform can be
instituted which will counterbalance the in-
creased wages. Taking the figures of the
six leading mines for last year they show:
91,900 tons; value, £110,350; dividends,
£40,688; costs, £69,662. Averages: Yield,
245. per ton; dividends, Bs. 2d.; costs, 15s.
2d. As a record this will take a lot of beat-
ing.
* * * *
Among the sickly lot of Ballarat East
shows New Normanby could have pretty
well squared up accounts for the last half
of 1915 had stone at 1500 ft. and 1600 ft.
milled even 4dwt. With an average of a
dwt. less the shortage was £l2OO, and with
wages higher this may wind up the mine.
Prom start to finish the co. has paid the
miner better than the shareholder. Out of
gold won, valued at £530,000, divs. have
totted up to only £37,000. There was no
extravagance in management, as board fees
after a quarter of a century’s work only
amounted to £1893. The hungriest blood-
sucker was the royalty man, as he nibbled
in £27,000 of the profit. Most of the other
receipts went this way: Wages, £281,500;
tributors, £50,991; fuel, £48,607 ; mine con-
tractors, £38,486; stores, £29,968; timber,
£15,555. So the worker and storekeeper
will miss the claim more than anyone else
it it gives up the ghost.
*• * * *
Twelve Westralian gold-mining cos. paid
dividends aggregating £771,438 in 1915, com-
pared with £799,392 distributed by 16 in
1914. Associated, Black Range, Ida H.,
Menzies Consolidated and Oroya Links were
on the 1914 list, but do not appear on last
year’s, while Golden Horseshoe appears on
the latter but not on the former. Edna May
with £77,131 and Kalgurli with £102,000
were up £8571 and £6OOO respectively; Great
Boulder (£262,500) and Mararoa (£15,000)
remained stationary ; and except the Kyarra,
which may never pay another dividend, all
the rest showed substantial drops. The only
cos. that are likely to maintain their 1915
totals during the current year are the Edna
May, Golden Horseshoe, Great Boulder,
Ivanhoe, Sons of Gwalia and South Kal-
gurli. Lake View and Star looks like miss-
ing a dividend, but should be all right later
on ‘ *
Sandstone (W.A.) seems to have done its
dash. Only empty beer barrels, a few odds
and ends, and an occasional passenger now
leave by the outgoing weekly train, and the
incoming one doesn’t bring as much. The
Railway Department is losing money hand
over fist, of course, and unless things look
up a bit, which is unlikely, traffic is in dan-
ger of being stopped altogether, though the
interest bill won’t notice that. As regards
mining, the outlook is rotten. Some months
ago the Oroya-Black Range Co., which three
years back acquired the Sydney-controlled
Sandstone Development blocks and after-
wards amalgamated with the Yuanmi, has
ceased operations and left a caretaker and
a few tributors to look after the £30,000
plant and the big hole it made in the ground.
The. Hans Irvine Black Range Co. is trans-
ferring to the Pinnacles, and the only other
co. with any money is the Black Range West.
Sydney and a few supporters have already
put up something like £20,000 in calls, but
even the worm will turn. The number of
privately-owned shows in the district is few,
and none seem worth a co.’s attention.
* * * *
Returns from Meekatharra (W.A.) con-
tinue good. Last month the Fenian earned
a profit of £5OOO, and its next-door neigh-
bor, the Ingliston Consols, distributed
£2OOO among its shareholders. Ingliston
(late Commodore South) is, after an uphill
battle, providing for plant equipment and
development out of gold won, and is now
stated to be in a position to pay dividends.
Ingliston Extended is also reported to be
coming on well. Profitable ore has just been
driven on for a length of 200 ft. at the 550 ft.
level, and the western lode, which winzing
proved to go down and maintain good
values, is being sought for at the same
depth.
* * * *
South Kalgurli kept pace with the mill
during the half-year ended September 30,
the ore visible on that date being estimated
at 166,200 tons, worth 6dwt., against
165,146 tons of the same value at the begin-
ning of the term. The “probable” ore on
September 30 is given as 83,110 tons, worth
sJdwt., against 85,310 tons, worth
The manager is optimistic concerning the
outlook, and reckons there are years of
profitable working ahead.
Riverina South (W.A.) has a chance.
Melbourne holds an option, and judging by
recent developments it is certain to be exer-
cised. Shares are tipped to see a good rise
before or about the middle of next year, but
money is wanted to prevent the co. acquiring
the hateful habit of working from hand to
mouth and to give the mine an opportunity
to show its real capacity.

Bonnie Dundee, Charters Towers, will dis-
tribute 8015 shares in proportion to present
holdings. There are 120,000 shares alto-
gether. Latest news encourages the hope
that the Bonnie, after its numerous recon-
structions, will get on to payable stone
again. At 80ft. down the underlay thei'e
is a formation 4ft. wide, carrying on the
hanging-wall 15in. of good stone. No. 3
level at 234 ft. west of the shaft has 12in. of
payable stuff in the face. But dividends are
far in the distance, and depend on the Bril-
liant reef, which is being followed below
1800 ft. The reef is between well-defined
walls, and that’s hopeful.
* * * *
New Ruby Flat (Tas.) washed out £2106
worth of tin last half-year at a cost of
£1641. There wasn’t much to the good in
that, but the co. had enough in hand to pay
a sixpenny (the 26th), so the shareholders
got it (£640, including income tax). The
co. can go ahead on its present face until
well into next season; after that “opera-
tions will be resumed in the eastern or main
creek side of the fiat, where there is several
years’ work.”
* * * *
Manager Millen, at Mount Bischoff
(Tas.), is putting up plant to work the
wash in the valley north of the old mine,
and it should be running this month. If
bores come up to prospects the old claim
will be able to flutter along for a time, even
under the higher w 7 age log. At the upper
mine-faces prospects can’t improve, for the
best of the deposits were cut oxit long before
Millen came along. The Bischoff Board
should long ago have rooted out a new pro-
perty to replace the old mine. But the direc-
tors let the Rosebery group slip into the
Mount Lyell maw, and apparently they are
not giving a thought now to Round Hill or
the Dreadnought tin prospects at Renison.

Oil-expert Wade is in Hobart, where he
varies Christmas diet by giving straight jabs
to the people at the back of the Bruni Island
and Latrobe oil-boring schemes. These snap
back, but they can’t get away from Wade’s
retort that a bore already just through the
Latrobe shale failed to get a streak of wax
or petrol. Wade therefore redoubles his
warning to the yokels that if they are to
get oil at Latrobe to feed the Australian
Navy it won’t be out of George Meudell’s
bore, but from distillation retorts. The
Bruni Island project got short shrift. The
result was hot paper talk, out of which re-
solved a denial by Wade that work done
by the South Australian Oil Wells show had
falsified his deductions. Specially does
Wade find fault with being charged with
having said that the covering rock in S.
Australia was thin. His distinction is in
the assertion that the cover generally is thin,
but that it thickens to the south-east. Thus
he has a loophole to flutter out of if Whaley
lobs on to a gusher, which is really very neat.
* * * *
G. D. Meudell has issued the prospectus
of the Tasmanian Oil Wells Co., with a
capital of £13,000, which proposes to bore
through the oil shales near Latrobe (Tas.)
in the hope of striking a “gusher” in the oil
sands said to exist underneath. Federal oil
expert Wade declares there isn’t a particle
of evidence of the existence of any “oil
sands” there at all —that, indeed, a bore put
right down through the shale failed to reveal
a trace of their existence. He says the
chances of getting free oil in this particular
country are Buckley’s. Meudell (who is
off to New Caledonia for a while) mentions
the S. Australian experience, and remarks
that Wade’s disapproval is something to go
on with. They are really both of them
much too cocksure.

Sydney, January 3, 1916.
My Dear Arini, —
The G.-G. Ferguson and his lady came
over for the New Year’s haggis. The large
and sturdy-looking Major Foxton still lin-
gers in the wake of his Ex. tame woik
when the drums are calling.
The programme of the New Year’s Scot-
tish concert threatened to continue into next
week. Double and treble encores being at
last declined by the company, the enter-
tainment ended at a reasonable hour. Harry
Campbell, a Chatswood tenor; Bessie
Fraser, a special favorite with a Tam o’
Shanter audience; Malcolm McEachern and
Daisy Sweet were soloists. W. A. Miller
was at the organ. Arundel Orchard steered
the Highland Society’s choir through an
unexciting series of efforts. _ Somewhere
about the middle of the entertainment Wal-
ter Bentley took possession of the stage,
and delivered a long discourse on the war
and the greatness of Scotland. This was
followed by a recitation. Just as -the audi-
ence saw the next musical items in sight
the Rev. Tom Tait busfled down the plat-
form. He, too, had something to say. It
was about the Burnside Orphanage at
Parramatta. He was mercifully short, and
the yawns of the Choral Society were
smothered.
This Burnside orphanage is Colonel
James Burns’s baby; and as the Colonel is
chief of the Caledonian Society and Munro
Ferguson’s crony in Sydney, the orphanage
benefits by several of the New Year out-
bursts of haggis and heather. The institu-
tion doesn’t often send the hat around. The
homes themselves—a series of roomy cot-
tages, with plenty of sleeping-out space—
have been provided by James Burns and his
rich friends. Only for the upkeep is the hat
occasionally circulated.
The liveliest item in the New Year’s sing-
song was the arrival of the kilted Fair-
guson, preceded by the giant pipe-major and
the skirl of the bagpipes. Lady Helen, Gen-
eral Finn (in lobster-red military fixings)
and Dugald Thomson were in the G.-G.’s
party. At the finish of the festive “Auld
Lang Syne” a packed audience clasped
hands with its neighbors and bawled in
about 100 different keys, “We’ll tak’ a rielit
guid. willie wacht,” or something to that
hilarious effect.
Admiral Sturdee, one of the baronets in
the New Year list, has a brother a Vic-
torian doctor. A son of the latter is a
captain in the Royal Australian Engineers,
now at the Front. lie has been about 12

A very young Miss Hope has just been
named Joan Isabella in Scotland. She is
a grand-daughter of Australia’s first G.-G.,
Ilopetoun, afterwards Linlithgow. Joan’s
papa is remembered here as a nice-looking
youngster in Eton coat, etc., looking at the
Commonwealth crackers over the edge of a
wide, turned-down collar.
This year Tasmania will swarm with
legal limbs. Justice Gordon and his musical
wife are amongst the highbrows who will
play on the same picnic ground as Common-
wealth C.J. Samuel Griffith and State C.J.
Cullen during the long vacation.
The Highland Society’s big outing
on January 1 was a quieter event
than usual. The attendance and the
entries showed the toll of the war
In particular, the pipe band has suf-
fered from the call to the Front. But
wliat is left of it made dreadful noises when
tuning up to meet the G.-G. In front the
inpe-major shook his great wand till the
leathers in his towering tea-cosy waved like
streamers. His Ex., who bears up cheerily
no matter what the pipers do to his ear-
drums, stepped out for the grandstand in
the wake of the players. Ladv Helen

W. Urquhart, governor of Goulburn Gaol,
and a mighty Hielander, held forth in Gaelic
to a select few who looked as if they u “ da f
stood it. This was near the Inverness meet
ing-place at Saturdays Scottish spoits.
Urquhart knows considerably more than the
Celts’ ancient patois. He is a bookish man
and a relative of the Urquhart who trans-
lated Rabelais.
Colonel Jack Antill sends a line from Gal-
lipoli—written, of course, before the giea
flit. He had been six months in the trenches
and remarks: “We occasionally sit down to
await developments, otherwise were a com-
munity of rabbits. The next generation
should have claws.... There is one thing
certain. Our men have done or tried to do
the impossible, and their resource, initiative,
cheeriness and discipline are incomparable.
In my battalion we have already one ( \ .C.
and six D.C.M.’s and others to follow.
This letter of Jack Antill’s recalls the
agitation started by some people tor
the preservation of old Government
House at Windsor. It is_ not much
of a place, certainly, being mainly
ruin and decay; but in addition to having
been Government House it is probably the
oldest home in Australia; and anybody with
the least imagination who sees it can visual-
ise the old-time Governor’s wife chasing the
family goat out of the dining-room, or feeding
chickens off the back verandah. The oldest
home in Australia seems a place that should
be preserved as a national relic, anyhow. It
is supposed to have been built in 1796.
Some of the big bowling chiefs from Lis-
more are in town. Engineer George Minns,
brother of artist B.E. and about the same
length, is with the party. A _ dinner on
January 7 is included in the festive round.
By the way, did you notice Minns’s Kaiser
drawing last week? A very old, furrowed
man —that’s the real Kaiser, as Minns saw
him not very long ago.
Major David Storey, a son of the M.L.A.
with the highly polished dome, was married
at St. Philip’s grey old church the other
day. As I told you, he met his fate, Miss
Bennett, a Pymble girl, on his way home in
the Maloja. Storey, junior, gets about three
months’ leave to recuperate after exchang-
ing compliments with the Turk. He still
limps as the result of his share of shrapnel.
As the groom felt it awkward to offer his
bride his right arm, since his hand was hold-
ing the necessary stick, he was about to give
his left wing, when a shocked verger, who
possibly feared it wasn’t lawful, protested.
“Oh, very well,” said the soldier cheerily.
So the lady, who was smartly gowned in a
cream travelling outfit, gently clasped her
new husband’s right sleeve. A brother of
the groom, Dr. Storey, is still at the Front.
The Allies’ Day art union, for which
Anthony Horderns gave the prizes, besides
managing the show, was drawn in the
firm’s Art Gallery. Mrs. George Black and
Neville Mayman officiated. A small but
appreciative audience (mostly press)
gathered round the ceremony. Basket-
shaped bottles held the ivory-shaped discs
with the numbers on. The lady gave each
receptacle a hearty shake, then took out a
number from each. Miss Bigg, of Liver-
pool, had the luck to win the first prize
(£lOO worth of furniture or its equivalent).
Rosetta Giuno’s (or maybe it’s Ginns’s)
name had to be dissected by the firm’s expert
magician in caligraphy, H. Tear. As win-
ner of the third prize, she starts 1916 with
a new sewing machine. Horderns’ general-
manager Gillett, who gave an eye to the
arrangements, remarked that the total
“catch” runs to £1723.
The Sydney Mayoral tangle was in a
dense knot when _ Town Clerk Nesbitt lost
his wife. The quiet lady, who used to go to
municipal parties in the piping days of
peace, had been an invalid for months. She
was much given to religious works of the
Methodist persuasion.
Captain Segrave, R.N., who was here a
while ago, is now in London. Before leav-
mg this side he had a look-round and takes
a fair knowledge of Australia to an important
billet on the other side. He’s the man who
was naval attache in Vienna when the war
broke out.
nr*?, bjon^ 0n a week ago Lieutenant Bruce
YaHier son of Mrs. Willie Walker, of
vi oollahra, gave his outside name to Kath-
leen Myles, of Burwood, who recently treked
homewards to see her convalescent fiancA
Bieut. Bruce was recovering after getting
some damages at the Dardanelles.
a m W6 tm after jHTival in London of the
Arthur Rhodes trio from Clich (M.L.) only
daughter Mane married Major George
Hutton, of the Fusiliers. A short, sweet
honeymoon at the English Lakes was the
interlude between the wedding and the word
of command somewhere “abroad.”
A soldier complains of the charges for
extras which our men had to pay the bri-
gands at the Dardanelles. He quotes 9s
a tin of coffee and milk. By Q the time it
reached Galhpob, however, that was “t so

And what about Austraban canned fruiL
Is it a fact that it won’t cany througn
the 1 tropics, or is the supply getting low?
Anyway, we pay Is. 9d. a tin for Ca 1
fruit because the man behind the counter
says the local peach isn't canned for tra e .
I don’t know what happens to it wl e
it gets away from home in its little tin
house, buy U.S. stuff to be on the
safe side. If ever there was a time when
the Australian fruit-potting business ought to
boom, this is it. But we seem to be driven
to the foreign article in the same old waj.
The engagement of the popular Rose
Hives, who lived with her late parents at
Ryefield, Masterton (M.L.;, is being told
about. The soldier she’s to marry is Cap-
tain Magrath, R.F.A., and his people have
dwelt a long time at Cosham, in Hants. Miss
Hives is a niece of “Haddon” IV batman,
who owns Abbotsfield station in M.L., and
once offered a real Dreadnought to the
Empire if the Admiralty would call it after
his ranch. England didn’t accept the offer.
The wealthy Whatman uncle does his duty
generously in every way except that he is a
bachelor. His name turns up in print very
often as giving wool bales and cash to the
war funds.
Since Dr. Jesse Aspinall became Mrs.
Ambrose Freeman she has been up with her
mine-engineering husband looking at the tin-
dredges that are biting into the jungle
around Taiping, in the Malay States. Hus-
band is kept busy longer than he expected on
scout bores and check bores and other beasts
unknown to me; so Dr. Jesse was looking
southward and- thinking of a lonely trip.
But she won’t have that now; Mrs. W. A.
and Miss Lucy Freeman left Sydney by the
Montoro on the last day of bad old 1915, and
after giving their moral support to the
Taiping family for a few weeks will return
with the lady part of it via Colombo —pro-
vided the Australian mailboats are still
steaming that way.
From the diary of a hefty man who
shouldered his garden tools for Dr. Arthur’s
digging and clearing bee in French’s Forest:
Left home soon after 6 a.m.; arrived at the
Spit in good time. Sat down and contemplated the
scenery, with about 50 others, till a launch hove in
sight. Held about half our lot. Went on as far as
E’lat Rock, Middle Harbor. Sat down while our
craft returned to pick up the others and bring a
guide. Off at last. Tramped through two miles of
scrub, and reached destination soon after noon.
Enthusiasm had several hours to cool, but it revived
at sight of the land. Each man hit the earth any-
where with anything he had in his hand. Thirty
coal-lumpers, who’d given up their holiday to do
their bit, made mighty blows at the business of
clearing five-acre blocks for returned soldiers. If
this proposition of putting men on soil that will
grow goats and passion- fruit continues, how about
organising the means of transport? This week-end
I think of starting the day before, and marching
on French’s Forest from Manly.
Apropos of Lady Dudley with her hands
in white kid gloves “doing” the lady-overseer
business amongst hard-worked nurses, there
is something of a precedent. The eccentric
Marquis of Abercorn, who died in 1818, in-
sisted on his housemaids wearing white kid
gloves when they made his bed. The same
nobleman, when he heard that his wife (who
was also his first cousin) was thinking of
eloping, sent her word to take the family
coach. “It must never be said,” he wrote,
“that Lady Abercorn left her husband’s roof
in a hack chaise.”
The response to the call for field-glasses
has been so disappointing that, the need
being urgent, sporting women in the country
will perhaps now come to the rescue.
A seaside hotel on the brink of the Pacific
has been having a very merry Christmas and
quite a bright New Year. A perennial
drawing-room entertainer, dressed as a house-
maid, waited on the distinguished company
the other night—and that was considered
just It by admiring friends. With such
sports do the truly great unbend before the
Christmas goose.
. Ruth Bucknall, the pretty Willoughby
girl who took a bell-like soprano into vaude-
ville work, is doing remarkably well in Eng-
land. She was helped over the first stiles
here by the Girls’ Realm and Mrs. Ouesnel
her teacher.
Rumors about appointments to the Con-
servatorium are still flying round. Pianist
l intel has retired for a time, anyhow, from
,® Possible aspirants, and is on a vaude-
ville circuit. A singing master—there will
probably be more than one—is now being
discussed. There’s a mention of Albert
Goossens, who was the baritone voice with
our winter visitors, the Belgian band. Goos-
sens fought m the early days of Belgium’s
stniggle, and saw the horrors of Louvain

Since her secession from St. Vincent’s
Convent the axis of Madame Christian’s
school of music sticks out elsewhere. Her
reappearance m secular garb interests resi
dents of Rose Bay and Bellevue Hill. But
as the distinguished singer never was a full-
blown mm, never took the final vows, her
breakaway is nothing sensational. She did
pretty much as she wished in her Garcia
school near the Convent, and even took one
or two extremely select boarders—the Mik.
Macleav lady, for instance. When Delegate
Peretti blew hereward he told the dominant,
clever old lady that she must obey orders,

Master of Music) she tucked her baby-grand
n ruler her arm, accepted the return of the
money .he had brought into St Vincent's,
bought a fashion journal, and as the lankees
say “pulled foot.”
Maudie Telfer, the Sydney girl who went
to the other side to join the Quinlan Co.,
writes that she is booked for a long pro-
vincial tour. But not with the opera co.,
for that melted away m the fiery times.
Maud’s soprano was heard in Manchester a
few weeks ago.
A Pymble girl, Clara Hart, has allowed
Lieut Albert Hatfield to throw a lasso
around the orthodox finger. He’s a son of
A. H. Hatfield, of Elderslie, Cottesloe Beach,
Westralia.
Eileen Boyd, the Sydney contralto who
went to London with the Steffanis about
three years ago, used to write regularly of
her good luck in getting engagements. This
was before the guns began to crash. Then
came the news that she d maiiied a Captain
Somebody—the name has gone astray. Now,
after a few months matrimony, Eileen is a
widow.
Wedding bells rang out in Chatswood
when Nina, a daughter of J. McManus-
Booth, of Burwood, stepped up St. raid’s
aisle. Ivory-tinted bridal plumage, with the
pinafore-shaped corsage of the moment, was
trimmed with the dainty illusion known as
shadow lace. An imposing Court train, with
a faint-blush pink lining, trailed after the
foamy drapery. Horseshoes of silky texture
and orange blossom completed the stunning-
effect of the bridal finery. The groom, if
that detail matters, was John J. Hill, of
Northwood. Bridesmaidens Lita Booth,
Mavis Dunlop and Lorna Neilley tripped
behind the heroine. The Allan Neilleys—■
relatives of the bride —gave the wedding
party at Nirvana in the rose-garden suburb.
Mrs. Paulis (mostly called “Powell”),
widow of a one-time Belgian tenor, joined the
last outgoing hospital-boat as masseuse,
almost at a moment’s notice. She’s now rid-
ing the waves aboard the green-striped vessel
somewhere between Here and There. As a
distinction from the army nurses, who are
uniformed in grey, the masseuse in the case
was fitted into a caped rig of navy, with
neckgear and cuffs of scarlet, and the usual
silver fittings in the way of buttons and
suchlike.
J.C.W.’s first “Girl in the Taxi” added a
little Suzanne to the already over-girled popu-
lation the other day. She of the Taxi,
Maggie Jarvis that was, is now Mrs. J. S.
Reynolds, and the duo inhabit one of the
Cliveden flats when they are at home. The
third member of the family, however, an-
swered her first roll-call out Point Piper way,
where the view is blue and worth the
money.
The Waitara Home for babes is going to
have _ a christening on January 12. An
addition made to the home by the kindness
of subscribers—-the John Toohey dame fore-
most among them- —-will be opened on that
date. A held-over Christmas tree for the
youngsters is part of the festivity.
Excitement exuded amongst the climbing
community of M.L. lately when it heard that
the slirn wife of chief-guide and eharmer-of-
shc-tourists Peter Graham had clambered to
the 12,000 ft. crest of Mt. Cook. No white
woman had done it before. Mrs. Graham’s
home is at the Hermitage, where travellers
are apt to open their eyes and ears at her
piano-juggling. Her parents own Welling-
ton s big music-making menage, which hasn’t
got a German name, and they brought her up
musically.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, January 3,191 b.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The New Year’s Day meeting at Flem-
ington was held in a vague social undertone,
owing to the appalling scarcity of sheep
duchesses and so forth. It was a pertec
golden day, with flecks of blue and diamond ,
that encouraged you to take an intelligent
interest in what summer frills were on view.
The lawn was carpeted terribly with bookies
wives and people with puce faces and yellow
hair and a general mass of drifting un-
knowns who were about as interesting
socially as bundles of straw. During the
day two women were seen sitting in tne
committee pen, and the vice-regal crimson
was carefully wrapped in holland with a
bored policeman on guard. It was no job
for a strong man. Any stray racing folk who
met began to violently apologise for being-
present, explaining that it was quite an
accident.
In these drab times any creature who
wears colors and trimmings is regarded as a
selfish hen-parrot, and is asked indignantly
where she keeps her knitting-bag. Ihe best
toilette of the day was a froth of black chifton
roofed with a spined sunshade of wispy lace.
An ex-mayoress of Malvern was equipped in
the best fawn suit seen on the terrace—and
there were crowds of the costumes walking
about. The rest of the picture was mostly
white boots. When the short skirts flapoed
in the breeze one saw some startling effects
above the boot-tops, especially when the legs
were in black stockings. The parti-colored
boots that melt down over the heel and
instep with contrasting uppers give a de-
formed, fowlish expression to the most
shapely feet. Altogether the most fashion-
able of the women resembled pre-histonc
birds with their slouchy shoulders and uncer-
tain waists.
Major Kerr-Pearse, who used to be gent-
help and private sec. to Governor Macartney,
of the Speck, has gone to help G.-G. Fergu-
son. leaving his Island job to a wounded hero,
Captain Donaldson, of the Irish Royal Rifles,
who was through the retreat from Mons and
saw the Huns rage furiously in other parts
of France. Donaldson says the Germans
went to certain destruction in their massed
attacks with a calmness and steadiness that
not even British troops could show. Ilis own
closest call came when he was in a field hos-
pital. The place was smashed to pieces, and
of the 50 men in it only he and one other
were not killed.
Russell Clarke —William Lionel Russell,
to be precise—son of the late Janet Lady and
half-brother to S’Rupert—has enlisted as a
private in the Expeditionary Forces. The
case of Corporal John Wren, who entered
the army with a fine flourish of advt. and
dropped out of it when his marching powers
were tested, makes one dubious about the
durability of these star enlistments. But
W. L. R. Clarke is three years younger than
Wren, and is understood to have passed the
medical exam, with honors.
The G.-G.’s new A.D.C., Haskett Smith
(with Captain in front of it), awakens sleep-
ing memories of the portly parson whom R,
S. Smythe brought to' Australia as a lec-
turer on Egypt and Palestine. The late
Rev. Haskett Smith had a parsonic delivery,
but he was full of matter concerning the
Pharaohs and the Holy Land. Moreover,
his rambles by the Lake of Galilee and there-
abouts had enabled him to take matter-of-
fact views of the places that dear old ladies
speak of with bated breath. Talking of his
12 visits to Jerusalem he used to mention the
case of an awe-stricken lady parishioner
who asked him whether he had ever been
to Nazareth. “I did my shopping at Naza-
reth,” said the Rev. Haskett. “Shopping at
Nazareth!'’ said the shocked old lady. “Row
projane!”
A brilliantly-clever Melbourne boy, J. A.
Gray, has joined a Canadian Battery of Siege
Artillery as a gunner. Young Gray, whose
parents live at Parkville, graduated at Mel-
bourne University. He took his B.Sc. degree
there, and won three or four scholarships in
mathematics and natural philosophy. Then
he went to the Royal College of Science in
London, and from there to Manchester, where
the D.Sc. degree came to him. Afterwards he
was appointed Assistant-Professor of Physics
at the McGill University in Montreal. That’s
how Dr. Gray came to enlist as a man
behind a Canadian gun. It seems a pity that
so much valuable scholarship should be tak-
ing so much risk, but perhaps his mathemati-
cal brain can be turned to good account in
gunnery. Anyhow, he’s a shining example to
the slackers.
The widow of the late parson Stanley
Lowe passed out last week in Ceylon, where
she had lived with daughter Irene and son-
in-law Captain Stainer, R.N. Her grandson,

nelles with a number of other invalided Aus-
tralians.

The Charles Fairbairn family are oft again
to London, son Osborne b eil l g wounded and
in need of petting. Daughter Esther of the
tawny hair has been missing from the social
whirlpools for some time, and hei best lags
hang neglected on the wardrobe hooks, She
now looks very fetching in the uniform of a
nurse at St. Vincent’s Hospital, and the
Sisters of Charity tell her she would make a
beautiful nun. Meanwhile there is a scramble
amongst the boys to be tucked away in her
ward.
Monty Douglass, of Geelong, who flopped
out of the parental nest at Western Beach
as a public-school recruit for Gallipoli, has
had a bright career since he struck the
shrapnel zone in a private’s uniform. He
spent a long time at trench work, was men-
tioned in despatches, fell ill and was pre-
sently shipped to England to recover. Dur-
ing his convalescence he studied for a com-
mission in the British army, and is now

A housefather in St. Ivilda, who tried to
do the Santa Claus business with the aid of
a bed quilt, a snow-drift of whiskers and a
few yards of ermine fur, is now going about
in linen wrappings with a detestably sore
head. His own story is that he had reached
the children’s room with his bundle of gifts,
and was groping in the gloom, when some-
thing hit him. He isn’t in a position to
identify the thing that hit him, but there is
circumstantial evidence pointing to an old
iron bed-leg that used to be out in the yard.
In fact, it has been divulged that this house-
father’s two nice little boys (seven and nine)
conspired with the nice little boy next door
—Bs —to lay for Santa Claus on the former’s
premises, and wooden him. To this end
the nice lad from next door was
smuggled in and hidden behind the curtains.
Explaining the matter, the elder son of the
damaged housefather said that as they sus-
pected Santa Claus of gross partiality
towards the Anderson family further up the
street, they had decided to “out” him, and
take the lot. Pa congratulates himself on
not having come down the chimney. His
own bright boy was on guard there with a
Boer-war bayonet.
Edward Rigby, of the massive Austral
Otis Co. in Melbourne, has brought up his
sons to follow in his engineering footsteps.
As a result, young Harry, whose Malvern-
grown complexion has for some time been

The medical Reggie Morrisons’ eldest boy,

Mrs. Merrilees, mother of the Merrilees
medicine men, is down from Roma in
Bananaiand, putting up at the Oriental.

A motor smash on the North-road on Friday re-

examining the car for damages. A good part of his
life was spent in the North, but for some years
past he had lived at the homestead at the Morphett-

The Government’s latest undertaking—the Depart-

Victoria Square, with W. A. Hargraves as its direc-

to foster industries by experimenting in the utilisa-
tion of the State’s raw materials, both mineral and
agricultural. Credit for the idea is due to Minister-
of-Industry R. P. Blundell.
Recruiting figures are showing the increase that
was prophesied for them after the Christmas holidays,
and not before it is time. Colonel Sandford tem-

SCHWEPPES LIMITED.
TO THE PUBLIC
We are instructed by our clients, Schweppes Limited, the well-known Manufacturers of Mineral
Waters, to make the following statement in consequence of false and malicious rumors having
been spread that they are a German Firm.
The original Jacob Schweppe was a. Swiss, who having been in partnership with two other Swiss
citizens (the original founders of Soda Water), at Geneva, as artificial mineral-water manufacturers
from the year 1760, came to London in 1794 to set up a similar business for himself by processes
which, with modifications and improvements, are still followed. Schweppes’ products attracted
great attention from the Medical profession in England, and the increase of his business led him
to take three Englishmen into partnership by deed dated 14th May, 1798, under the style of J.
Schweppe & Co. Jacob Schweppe himself retired from active management in 1799, but the
partnership was carried on for many years by Englishmen, under the old name, which had become
identified with excellence and purity of the Waters supplied. In 1834 the business was acquired
by the father of the present Chairman of the undertaking,'the name being altered to Schweppes
Limited on the formation of a Public Company in 1897, the whole o v f the Capital being then taken
up in England.
All the Directors of the Company are, and always have been, Englishmen, who have held or
are holding important public positions ; all the employees are British ; cind the whole of the products
are manufactured exclusively in Great Britain and A ustralia . Of the large number of persons (over
5000) holding shares in the Company, whose Share Capital exceeds one million sterling, there is
only one (holding 25 £ 1-Shares) who lives in Germany or Austria.
The present Directors are as follow

Picking-up.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Prisons Department is democratic
in the way it conveys its daily haul to
Long Bay. Out in that drab institu-
tion the black sheep of Sydney are divided
from the goats, and the goats from the kids.
There are, in all, nine divisions —from the
aristocratic debtors, who rank as “con-
finees,” to the long-distance and frequent
offenders; and they have separate “ranges”
and yaids as far as possible. But in the
Black Marias which garner the day’s catch
from police stations. Children’s Courts and
so on, and take it out for transference to the
prison train at the Darlinghurst Police
Stni ion, there is, as it were, no class dis-
tinction.
So it happened that I met the practi-
tioner of a unique profession.
“Oh, you’re all right, then; I suppose
you’ll get it paid, and he out,” said my
neighbor in response to my curt answer to
his question about myself. The people who
travel by II.M. Prisons vehicles or occupy
his boarding-houses evince a great curiosity
about the causes that have brought them
companions in misfortune. It is not a thing
to be resented; it is the same sympathy
that causes men to tell one another of their
physical troubles when they meet in a doc-
tor’s waiting-room.
“I’m different,” said my neighbor. “I’ve
got two months to do. Still, it’s not a busy
tune, and it’s all in the way of business.”
"Business?” I said.
“Yes ; I’m a picker-up.”
“What line’s that?” I asked, curiously.
“Oh, it’s no line; or, as you might say, it’s
any old line. It’s a business by itself, as the
sayin’ is. I got two months for it this
time. Got a cigarette?”
The question was superfluous, since I had
just drawn a packet from my pocket and
helped myself. I handed him the box.
“There’s only one or two of us in Sydney
in the business as a regular thing,” he said,
drawing at the smoke he was lighting with
a match lie had also borrowed by a dumb
action. “But there’s lots that try it on
now and again.”
"But Avhat is it?” I asked.
“Why, you just pick up things,” he re-
turned. “Say it’s Christmas-—that’s the
busy season. You’re mooching about with
an eye open, and you see some geese, or a
turkey, or ducks; well, you just pick ’em
up! Sometimes, if you dp well, you can get
enough to run a cart around selling them.
If not, you just get ’alf a suburb away,
quick, and sell out. If he’s good at it a man
can make a couple of quid a day when
things is brisk.”
“Stealing,” I commented.
"It depends on how you look at it,” he
said, coolly. “If it wasn’t for chaps like us,
a lot of people’d go without poultry
fer Christmas. The man who knows what
lie’s doing takes from places where there’s
plenty.
“Of course, there’s not a trade all the
year round in fowls, although it’s a good
stand-by, as the saying is. But there’s other
things. There’s blankets. Just on winter
people who ought to buy new ’uns start to
hunt out their old naps; and they ’ang
.’em on the line for an airing. AVell, you
just pick ’em up. There’s poor people who’re
worryin’ to know where to get the money
for blankets. They buy ’em cheap.”
“Don’t know they’re,stolen?” I suggested.
‘Call it stolen, if you like,” he returned,
unresentfully. “Of course, you spin a tale;
but they know. Still, being honest, they tell
themselves it’s all right. And then there’s
the rewards.”
“The rewards?”
‘ Yes ; if things are slack, you pick up a
pet dog or a cat, or a cockatoo, and wait
for the reward to be advertised. But there
ain t much in it: there’s too many people
think a ‘substantial reward’ is ’arf a dollar.
An old bloke what advertised that way
•nee gives me two bob. 4 ’Kre, wot’s this?’
r l says- ‘ls it to pay fer the dog’s-meat?’
then he slams the door on me. But I tells
lhe-neighbors Avhat I think of ’im.

Stop that laughing!” the command came
Irom the alley-way. The prison tram is a
series of locked compartments with a patrol
passage on one side. The voice of authority
sobered the picker-up a trifle.
a, m ? ntbs ter go!” he said gloomily,
ktill, it s in the way of business.”
“You must be caught pretty often?” I
suggested.
"Gli. no; this is only my_ eleventh.” lie
answered. A man has his set-backs in
every business. It’s all right as long as
B don t interfere with a busy season.”
I should say work was better.'’
“Oh. I’ve tried work,” he said. “It's not
that 1 mind it. but the profits ain t big
enough. Work ? Why, 1 went on the
wharves, lumping; but there’s too many pio-
fessionals there.”
“What —stealing?”
“I wish you wouldn't chuck that up so
often. No—picking up things. There’s a few
lias got the monopoly, as the saying ns.
So I w r as froze out. Of course, there’s pickers-
up in every trade. One place I was at there
was a traveller was a picker-up. He must
have made a couple hundred quid a year.
“What’s your religion?” he asked
abruptly.
“Well” I began slowly with a snnle.
“Be a Cartbolic,” he said. “You get_ more
attention from the priests; and there’s the
services, and it fills in time.”
The tram gave a screech as it turned on
a sharp curve and stopped.
“We’re here now,” said the picker-up.
“Don’t forget what I said about being a
Cartbolic. Got another cigarette?”
I felt in my pockets, but found my two
packets gone—and I knew where they were.
The picker-up didn’t return things, and he
had retained also a silver matchbox. But.
just at that moment, the prisoners were
being marshalled out, and I did not feel like
mentioning the matter.

Pandora’s Cat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rilllE origin of the outbreak was a sample
I of unique fatigue. Very few of those
concerned really heard anything about
it until the next morning, and by that time
Pandora and the cat were on the way to the
railway station to get their photographs
taken. The sun had nearly risen and a
great dun bank of wattles boomed incessantly
us with the splash of all the seas of the
world rolling fitfully against the pealing of
an Ottoman organ. The child was safely
wrapped up in a canopy of green leaves, and
uobody except Mary and John really expected
the Bishop to come home to dinner, ©till,
there was that money stacked on the table,
and if no one brought the venison it was
quite clear that one or the other would be
arrested before the service was over.
But for all their watchfulness the
photographer did not arrive, and the second
day of July had come to an end with a
concert given in honor of the aged verger
before anyone remembered the small man
with the curved whiskers who was to call
the next morning for the rent. Mary was
quite happy, and John read her one of his
favorite poems as the carriage rolled up the
gravel walk and disappeared into a gloomy
maze of cypress trees that grew on the
other side of the valley. These were the
words that brought tears to Mary’s eyes and
made her break off the engagement at exactly
the point where it had begun :
A cabbage is a simple thing
And makes a verdant show,
And it was in the happy spring

I did it with a hoe.

The wind had set the boughs a-swing,
The maiden's face was shy,
And it was in the happy spring
And nobody was by—
I felt inclined to try!
(Oh, Mary, wake to sing!
For the little bees can stmg
And the nodding peas are sitting in a row.)
\s he pronounced those fatal words poor
Pandora began to weep, and John, who had
for several stanzas past been secretly wiping
the corner of his eye on the sombre fringe
of the episcopal apron, slid along the slippery
decks to comfort her. Then, as the train
moved off, Mary, rising to the height of her
passion, stood upon the left arm- of the sofa
cover and poured the concluding verses loudly
into the Bishop s conscience-sti ickeu ear .
I told the dimpled maid to bring
Mv trusty knife and true —
Oh, this was in the happy spring
And all the skies were blue!
That tender fowl I slew!
(So, Mary, wake to sing!
For the little bees can >ting
And the river down the valley starts to flow.)
J needed no engagement ring,
Her lips were good to kiss,
For it is in the happy spring
That lovers And their bliss—
Anil sing such songs as this.
(Oh, Mary, try to sing !
For the little bees can sting
And there’s absolutely nothing in the show.)
As his voice died away Pandora wakened
as if from a dream, and Mary knew that the
supreme moment had arrived. The train
started with a bump which threw the Bishop
into Mary’s lap, and the cat leaped for the
porthole which fortunately had been closed
on account of the storm.
Many, many miles away the unhappy
author of all the trouble sat on the windlass
of a worked-out shaft and beheld the moon
rise out of the vast grey bosom of the South
Pacific Ocean. He knew that he was a
broken man —broken in health, in pocket, in
all that closely concerns the agricultural
member of a great political party. As
for his love affair, that had been nipped in
the bud the moment the Bishop arrived, for
no one except John had any chance with
Pandora when Mary was absent filling the
coal-scuttle with jewels and old boots. And
so the sorrowful night wore on to its gloomy
close.-
Meanwhile, the ship was far out beyond
the Heads, the tickets had been collected and,
on account of the lateness of the season, the
chief steward ordered all lights to be put
out by seven or the quarter-master.
The Bishop had no objection to tak-
ing this course, but John, as a family
man, thought his leave should have been
somewhat extended. He had large invest-
ments in Papua, and who knew what might
become of these if they were left open to
criticism in an ecclesiastical court before they
were converted into consols? Mary knew
these things, and Pandora had some inkling
of them, but both kept a discreet silence.
The Bishop was the only absolutely inno-
cent person, but as he was asleep a wreck
might have occurred at any moment without
his knowledge, and the company would have
been very much to blame.
And so it was with a great sense of relief
that they reached Mount Victoria at last. A
railway journey by a slow train is always
ant to upset the nerves a little, and the
Bishop, deeply religious as he was, was
heartily glad to be able to obtain a cup of
tea and a leg of mutton. The wonderful
thing had actually come to pass. Pandora
was to marry the heir of the Montmorency
estates, and Mary wept tears of gratitude
and repentance on John’s shoulder. The
Bishop gave them his blessing there and
then (he bad eaten all the mutton, so that's
all he had left), and the train rolled into
Newcastle annd such firing-off of crackers
and waving of flags as had not been known
since the first discovery of coal in that
district.
U .“AV’ said John bitterly to the Bishop,
bis loneliness showing in every line of his
handsome, evil countenance, “it is disappoint-
ment that leads us to stake our all on the
slender chance of securing a seat in Parlia-

Australia’s
Universal Car
11,200 on Australian Roads To-day
HThat the “Ford” is “Australia’s
Universal Car” is easily borne
out by the 11,200 in use in the
Commonwealth to-day, and the
variety oj f its uses abundantly
proves its ability.
® It is extensively used by the business man for actual business-getting’
and week-end and holiday family runs, as well as in light trolly form
for delivering urgent orders. The bord Vehicle has become an
indispensable asset to the draper, warehouseman, butcher, bakei,
dairyman and scores of other houses of trade, it also caiiies His
Majesty’s mails in various parts of the Commonwealth.
or The “Ford” is immensely popular among ladies for shopping and
' calls, which is undoubtedly due to the simplicity and safety of “Ford
control in crowded traffic.
«T The “Ford” is equally popular “outback” among farmers, stock and
11 station men, doctors, ministers and others. Its hill-climbing powers
are proverbial, and instances are quite common in which the Ford
has successfully negotiated swamps, dense scrub, heavy nnry roads
and tortuous hills where other and much more expensive cars have
failed.
#r The popularitv and success of the “Ford in Australia are undoubtedly
j * due to its lightness, strength, easy running, simplicity of control,
exceptional hill-climbing powers, and its remarkable low upkeep costs.

“Its not me that’s pushing — it’s this beast
of a man behind me!"
'( hug : In the recent hot weather all the
snakes didn’t keep to the Abo. page. In one of Syd-
ney s busy suburbs a small boy went to pick up a
stick the other day in the roadway between the Fire
Bugade station and the butcher’s shop. The stick
turned and bit him and had crawled away into safety
before the suburb awoke to the fact that a snake had
been sunning itself under the wheels of its progres-
p!\ 6 th USt fi Cai t ' theh ' OWn hose had re "ed up on
end the firemen couldn’t have been more astonished.
“The Oldest Inhabitant’s Grandad ’:
About the year 1882, or it may have been 1782, I
forget, I was in Inglewood (Vic.). One night a
wireless came through that Geordie Johnson, an old
English gentleman who had left his country for
pinching a rabbit or a policeman or something, was
making a rapid descent. Geordie was hermiting
on a vine-covered island on the liorong Creek, and
the late Dr. McVean asked me to go across with
him. We found the old fellow in a bad way; poison-
ing, it looked like. Inquiry as to his diet elicited
the fact that he had been living mostly on curry.
We had a look at the tin he indicated and found
there wasn’t sufficient insectibane left to settle a
decent family of fleas!
* * * *
“Stan E.”: When Captain Cook turned
those pigs loose in Maoriland, he didn’t reckon on the
curses they would wring from the settlers of
Northern Ivaipara. In the Maungaru district the
lean and hairy swine have for a long time been a
nuisance, on account of their gentle habit of rooting
up new' grass in the bush clearings, and now they
have added lamb to their previous diet of vegetables.
During the past two years the manager of the
Maungaru estate has been busy with men, guns and
dogs in thinning dowm the packs of porkers.
Butchers say that their flesh is no use, as it is
too lean. So the only profit from the slaughter is
in the saving of the local lamb for consumption with
mint sauce.
“Tropicus”: Though I am not prepared
to oblige “Doubter” (B. 9/12/T5) by getting bitten
by a poisonous snake to demonstrate my cure, yet
I rise to orate on the virtues of Potassium Perman-
ganate (Condy’s crystals). Pot. Permang. applied
within two minutes of being jabbed by black, brown
and tiger snakes is a cure; and I have also had
proof of its efficacy in the treatment of bites of the
black-and-red spider. In Papua, where I have spent
many years of hard toil W'ith Brown Brother, who
is an unpleasant person with nasty ways and worse
morals, the snake pest in the months of February
and August is responsible for many departures of
the colored nobility. So many deaths occurred in
the Port Moresby district in the ’9o’s that Mac-
gregor, then in charge of Papuan darkness, w'ent on
a burst of extravagance and invested nearly a fiver
in a supply' of Pot. Permang., which he distributed
gratis amongst the natives. They rejoiced greatly
and used it to dye their feathers and petticoats.
Brown Brother knew that the bite of the snake W'as
incurable by' human means, and absolutely refused
to waste good coloring stuff on wounds that were
past repair. -
“F.H.” : Apart from its value as an Aus-
tralian export for use in German explosives, picric
acid is worth a good deal to us as the best thing
yet for burns and scalds. The November Journal
or Agriculture (Vic.) gives the picric treatment
thus: “Get 3d. W'orth of picric acid, place in a
wide-necked pickle bottle and fill up with water.
So long as there are crystals undissolved keep filling
up with water. Swab the part burnt with this
picric-acid solution. Repeat at intervals until the
pain ceases.” It is recorded that children who have
been badly scalded have been kept in a bath of this
remedy for weeks and recovered. Of course, if the
solution were put up in a penny medicine-bottle,
with a bold, black name on a bright orange label,
priced at 2s. as a proprietary medicine, the thing
would be found on most bush mantelpieces- and
much suffering thereby avoided. As it is, how many
mothers-of-ten know, or care to know, what to do
when Willie joggles the boiled pudding off the
stove ?
* * * *
Outcast : Standards of beauty vary
somewhat in Papua. In some parts of the West, at
the mouth of the estuary of the Fly, the shape of
the head ought to be something
like that of a pear; and as Nature
doesn't do the job a mother has to
fix things herself for her baby.
Matters are arranged by manual
pressure. In the Torres Strait
Islands a head must be low in the
forehead, flat at the back and not
too well developed above. To attain
this ideal of beauty-culture in
Mabuiag there are two devices. One
is to call in a gentleman of the re-
quired standard of beauty before
the birth of the child, and engage
him to sit for some time behind the
mother. The other is by means of
skilful manipulation with the
mother’s hands. In the north of
Papua it is not aristocratic to have
a nose with a depressed tip, and to
avoid being out of the fashion a
mother squeezes her infant’s nose
with her fingers from tip to base.
Still I don’t suppose these methods
are much worse than erect-form
corsets or five-inch shoe heels.

“Warrego”: “Barcoo” (B. 11/11/A 5) sup-
plies details of big sheep counting with a stop-
watch thrown in for artistic effect. Arthur Shaw
of Lansdowne (now general manager of the Aus-
tralian 1 astoral Co.) was no slouch at counting
either, but I m sure he couldn’t go “Barcoo’s” pace.
Still, I’ll back him as a lamb marker. I worked
for him when he put through 8380 lambs, besides
counting the ewes, between sunrise and sunset in
June, with an hour off for lunch and two smoke-
ohs. I saw him put through 494 in 35 minutes.
This is the fastest work I’ve seen, but I admit
that I don’t carry' a stop-watch.
* *
Two Seas”: Bullock-persuaders vary in
their methods, like other artists. I saw Pat
Macguire once bogged in Pallal Creek (N.S.W )
He had half unloaded his freight of timber which
he was taking to our new selection when I overtook
him and stopped to investigate. First thing I
noticed was that his brake was on; so when he
had straightened up his team and urged them
vainly to shift half the load up the bank of the
creek I broke in with the innocent inquiry “Why
not try them with the brake off?” When he stared
first at me and then at the brake I prepared to
take a shorthand note of something reallv striking—
a burst of oratory that would worthily uphold the
traditions of his class. Instead, he scratched his
head, grinned sheepishly at me and muttered, “Dear

THE QUERY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve grafted here in heat and cold and mud and
slush and rain,
And now we’ve got to up and off and look for toil
again;
We’ve stood bad water, meat that’s worse, mosquitoes,
flies and fleas,
For here there’s many things to curse and very few
to please;
We’ve stood the clattering stamps on end, we've
punched a good shaft down,
And hoped in time to hail with joy the advent of a
town;
Now that we’ve put the crushing through, all that we
want to know
Is,. Will we get our money from the office down
below ?
It’s far away to Melbourne town, and we are stranded
here.
It’s bad enough to shift oneself, arifl worse to shift
one’s gear ;
There’s tucker bills and pub accounts and other
things to pay,
And coach and rail and steamer fares before we get
away.
They owe us all a fortnight’s screw, plus what they
hold in hand—•
It seems to me a rotten shame that working blokes
should stand
To risk so much in precious cash whose loss they’d
sorely feel;
But still it is the custom, and it doesn’t do to squeal.
So now the vital question upon this blown-out show
Is, Will we get our money from the office down
below ?
We started off with brightest hopes and stone that
should have paid,
If only, when it opened up, its pennyweights had
stayed;
But patchy, rotten stuff it proved, and every patch
grew worse,
Till now there’s not a face below that’s worth a
tinker’s curse.
It's just the usual miner’s lot—where’er he wants to
stop,
He’s out for serious trouble when the stamps begin
to drop.
And now the mine and plates are bare we’ve got to
pack and go—■
But \Vill we get our money from the office down
below ?
When first I came up here and heard the local liars
skite,
I thought the mining industry had prospects pretty
bright;
But now I’ve seen so many shows that go a grain
per mile,
I fancy they exaggerate with superhuman guile;
To get a job of any length upon a mine up here
You’d have to find a blanky show that cleaned up
once a year.
For once the fatal clean-up comes, to shock a hopeful
co.,
It’s, “Will we get our money from the office down
below ?”

Mr. James Durkin, the well-known free-lance journalist, who won the prize offered
recently by the management of “The Hypocrites’’ for the most caustic criticism of the famous
photo-play, in which “the naked truth” is represented by a nude woman.
Mr. Durkin’s denunciation was as follows: —-“The unhealthy and jaundiced medium through
which ‘The Hypocrites’ views every phase of life is apparent, not only from its indecency, but
also from its want of respect for all that numerous class of plain, upright men and unpretending
women of which the real worth and excellence of human society consists. .... How suen a
profligate picture as ‘Hypocrites,’ with its shallow and impotent pretensions can claim to
educate is beyond comprehension. It is without reverence for God or man. Neither home nor
religious life has any dignity in its eyes. In short, the whole business is pretence, vul H anty
and affectation.”
From the foregoing it can be judged that Mr. Durkin is a man who speaks his mind, and
when he has an opinion to express he does so in no uncertain terms. For that reason the follow-
ing letter of appreciation is of special interest and value.

An Australian comes home after many
years in S. America: —
I wonder why corrugated iron and weather-board-
ing have it all their own way in Australia for
houses in the country. What’s wrong with houses
made of adobe and tapia? (As a personal favor
please call these ah-doh-bay and tah-pee-ah respec-
tively.)
Adobes are simply air-dried bricks, generally
measuring about 2ft. x Ift. x 4in., made in a
wooden frame—-usually double, for making two adobes
at once. Any ordinary kind of earth is mixed with
water and straw or tussock, and made so liquid that
it will just stand after the frame is removed. The
frame is laid on flat ground, filled with the mud, and
then lifted off and laid ready for the next adobe.
'The adobes are left where made until partially
dried, and are then stood on edge to finish off. In
making them avoid frosty weather. They are laid
like ordinary bricks, liquid mud being used as
mortar. The walls are usually 2ft. —sometimes 3ft.
—thick for outer and Ift. thick for inner walls.
The foundations are generally of stone, laid with
mud mortar, reaching about a foot below the surface
or till fairly firm ground is reached, and about 6in.
above. When the house is built the walls are
plastered with more mud until smooth, and then
usually whitewashed. If more style is wanted use
distemper or wallpaper on the inside.
A tapia house is also built of mud, but not in
the form of bricks. A form is made, in the shape
of a box 6ft. long, 3ft. high and 2ft. wide, without
top or bottom. That is, it consists of two sides,
6ft. x 3ft., and two ends 3ft. x 2ft., not joined
together, but all separate. To build, first dig trenches
to firm ground for the foundations of all the walls,
fill in with stone (with mud mortar) to a height of
6in. above the ground, and then put the form on
this, tying the two sides together by five iron bolts,
and using the ends as distance pieces to keep the
sides 2ft. apart. Fill the form with damp earth—
not wet —and ram thoroughly. Take out the
bolts, and the form falls to pieces. Set it up again
with one end just overlapping the existing piece of
wall, and leave out the end piece at that end, so
that when the form is filled it will make a con-
tinuous length of wall with the preceding portion.
Fill up the form as before, and continue right round.
When the first course, 3ft. high and 2ft. thick, is
finished, continue the npxt layer on top, breaking
joint of course. Leave the necessarj' spaces for
doors and windows, although some builders build
the walls solid, and cut the doors and windows out
afterwards with a pick. Finish like an adobe house.
Wither style of house is very comfortable —cool in
summer, warm in winter. You can drive nails in
anywhere; but use Gin. nails. I have lived years
in such houses, in every variety of climate, and
can guarantee they are just “it” for comfort. Also,
they are sound-proof. 1 hate to hear the whiskers
growing on the man in the next room. The curse
of the wooden house is the way sounds carry from
one room to another.
Make easement windows opening outwards and
flush with the outside of the walls. So you have a
wide window-sill, to be used as a shelf or seat. By
making the windows flush on the outside the wind
does not whistle round the house.
For roof use anything you like. I have found
corrugated iron, with thatch on top with plenty of
mud in it, a good roof. Whatever kind of roof is
used, it ought to have eaves projecting at least 18in.
Jf this is attended to, and the outside whitewashed,
painted or distempered, the house looks well and
lasts well. It is fireproof and cheap. Whitewash
mixed with the glutinous juice of cactus does not
rub or wear off easily.
To make the place rat- and mouse-proof, bed wire-
netting in the bottom course, of the walls. Build
the floor, in moderately dry districts, close to the
ground, and fill in solid with gravel or sand.
Grateful builders of houses on these lines may, if
they wish, pay me for the ideas. I don’t insist, as
the Australian Government doesn’t believe in com-
pulsion. Still, I am anxious to see how much
L s. d. the voluntary system will bring me in. A
fair basis of payment would be £1 per room for
the comfort, and half the saving in cost compared
with a wooden house.
“Long Bill”: “Jaques” (B. 4/11/’l5)
speaks of the blood-sucking fly. Does he mean the
March fly? If so I can tell him a little. The beast,
seen under a good magnifying glass, has a tongue
which reminds me of a German New Guinea bayonet
-—one side smooth and'the other serrated. The ser-
rated side has teeth at the rate of 10,000 to the
inch, and the other side is sharpened to the keenest
edge known. You can trap the March fly easily
by using yourself as bait. Let him settle on your
arm and wait till he has started to guzzle. Then
stop breathing suddenly, and you have him prisoner.
He can’t pull his dagger out till you set your lungs
going again. I have seen boys catch hundreds that
way.

“Kukukuku”: Has any radio operator
ever hearkened to the locusts of Papua sending out
messages in the Morse code from tree to tree, in
the silence of the midnight jungle ? I have listened
to the Marconi locust (it has no doubt a scientific
name of some other kind, but that is the name it
ought to go by) night after night, from about 10
o'clock on, trilling out its dashes and dots, its dash-
dash-dot and its dot-dot-dash, for all the world like
a steamer lying at anchor in a quiet bay and talk-
ing to some sister ship a few hundred miles distant.
The insect-wireless likes calm nights, a little damp,
late hours and a clear send-out, just like the radio
operator. Somebody ought to read off its Morse
trillings some night and tell what they are all about.

At Ivelvedon, near Swansea (Tas.), there
is a fine collection of the skulls and bones, as well
as of the stone tools, of the long-since extinguished
Tasmanian aborigines, whose kitchen-middens and
camps are thick along this coast. These were got
together by the former owner of the place, E. O.
Cotton, a peppery and unconventional Quaker. Once
a distinguished scientist, who was visiting Hobart,
wrote asking if he could borrow some of the skulls
for examination, or, if Mr. Cotton did not care to
send them to Hobart, could he come to Ivelvedon and
examine them and take measurements. Cotton
replied as follows: “I shall be most happy if you
will visit me at Ivelvedon and see anything you
like; but I will not let the skulls go off the
place. They belong here, and, as far as lam con-
cerned, they shall stay here till the Day of Judg-
ment. If you scientific fellows got hold of them
the Angel Gabriel could blow till he was black in
the face before they got together again.”

Someone ran a tape around a dead
stringybark on Bruni Island (Tas.) the other day and
found it had a circumference of 100 feet at the
ground level. Measured 3ft. from the ground to
clear the spurs it ate up 80 feet of tape. And it had
once been bigger than that; but a fire had got at it
and this splinter was all that was left

“Little Black Ant”: “Barcoo” (B.
9/12/’l5) states that hairs from horse’s tail wound
round table legs will keep little black ants away.
I shall try it next time I can find a horse to pluck.

happiness of the children by going in pursuit of
them, hobbling hopelessly, snatching up stones and
sticks to hurl after them, and pausing every few
yards to execute a sort of doddering dance of frenzy.
All the township would flock to the fence 1 6 see
Old Geordie perform. One day C'ope left his burden
in the shadow of the Joker battery-house while he
put up a wild-goose chase, and in his absence tw'o
imps conceived the bright idea of dropping a worn-
out “bottom” into each of the cans. A “bottom” is
a round, flat slab of solid iron about 9in. in dia-
meter. A worn one would be perhaps an inch and a
half thick. Old Geordie Cope returned from his
hunt, breathless. He got under his yoke and gave a
lift. “Owww !” he grunted, “them dom young rascals
take all the strength out of un.” He tried again,
and went his way. That night when the 12 o’clock
shift was coming off Potter found Geordie sitting by
his cans in Cadden’s paddock all out. “Ah mun be
getten very owld fer aighty. Ah’ve bin sax hours
coinin’ the way fra’ the township,” he grumbled.
Potter investigated. The big iron discs were still
in the tins.

“Ashton M.”: Between St. George and
Bollon there are still scrubs of quandong trees, and
in September they splash rose-madder over the sombre
bush. There are two kinds of “red” quandong—the
“clingstone” and the “slipstone.” The latter is
most in request for jam, and is often stoned,
threaded and hung up in long strings to dry. The
whole fruit preserved in syrup and left to crystal-
lise has a delicious flavor resembling quir.ce. One
of the virtues of this good Australian fruit ■is that
it does best when other crops fail.

Dry Shave”: Wood that won’t burn, is
it? I don’t know if it was stringy-bark, G. Wash-
ington’s apple tree or prickly pear, but it had stayed
behind to argue with a bush-fire and had been badly
blackened for its trouble. The bank manager’s wife
spotted it as the wood, coal and coke merchant, rub-
bish removed, started to unload at the woodheap.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A good old dame is Janey Gee,
Who lives across tne way;
She simply thinks the world of me.
Her face is lined, but good to see;
Her hair is thin and grey. .
I found her shedding tears one day,
Her brow was stamped with woe;
“I’ve rowed with Jim,” she paused to say—
“ Perhaps I’ve been too hard. Oh, prat/.
Don’t let my husband go!
“Just say to him my heart is sore”
(She pulled me through the gate)—-
“I’ll never contradict him more.
Oh, hasten by the garden, or
You’ll surely be too late!”
I went and reasoned hard with him —
Next month he’ll be four score.
Now Jane is grateful to the brim,
Because ’twas I dissuaded Jim
From ’listing for the war !

“F N T ” : With apparent sincerity, “Cop-
pabella” (B. 25/11/T5) writes: “Strange,
but mustard fit for the table is one of the
simple things we can’t make in Austialia.
Well, I had what purported to be Austra-
lian mustard with my dinner to-day. I
believe I can reasonably claim that my
palate is still pretty well as good as it ever
was, and for the life of me I can t find any
difference in flavor, miscibility or bitefulness
between the Australian and British articles;
and they both look the same and smell the
same. The only point against the Austra-
lian article is that when my wife ordered it
the grocer told her it wasn’t as good as the
imported. I don’t think there is a dwelling
in the metropolis where the matter of
domestic costs and values is gone into more
particularly and with better results than
in this writer’s 0 x 8; and I can assure
“Ooppabella” that there will be no more
overseas mustard consumed here while the
local stocks hold out, no matter what the
retailer’s own opinion may be.

“Billy Blue”: Tanning was one of the
first industries established in N. S. Wales.
As early as October. 1800. one George Caley
wrote to Sir Joseph Banks:. “In course of
time, tanning of leather ought to be much
in practice here, for there are so many
different barks that are very strong astrin-
gents.” Caley was sent out by Banks to col-
lect botanical specimens. Ex-Governor
Hunter, in 1802, wrote to the Under-Sec-
retary of the Home Department: “Most of
the trees in N.S.W. afford a bark which is
strongly astringent, and answers well for
tanning leather; this I have tried in the
colony and found it succeed well.” Hunter
(1795 to 1S00) appears therefore to have
been our first tanner. In 1828 Governor
Darling wrote: “A tannery has been estab-
lished by an enterprising individual at
Sydney, 'where leather °* f "tpf moreopulent

“Ten Thousand Topsail-sheet Blocks” runs

A sailoring friend of mine, just now a gunner
pitching shells at the Turks, wrote to say that he
got the nautical surprise of his life when he looked
out from the gold bars of his Louis XVIII. —or was it
Charles IX. ? —stateroom in the troopship and counted
11 brigs in Alexandria Harbor. He had scarcely
imagined there were so many afloat. The brig in
Australasian waters is as numerous as proas at the
Pole, the last being an ancient contraption called the
Edward, which came to grief somewhere in Bass
Strait, I think, a year or so ago. But formerly
dozens of these craft sailed in and out of Sydney
Heads and Auckland. One good old hooker of this
type was the Vision, of Auckland, in which Louis
Becke told me he had the happiest days of his life
as supercargo ; she figures under another name in his
stories. The Cold Land sticks to the brig, and

When the Hobart Gas Co., which has now
handed the lighting of the streets of Hobart
ovei to the Government for value received,
was formed away back in 3 854 its charter
kdd down that the then new-fangled light
was to be “equal to that given by the whale-
oil lamps,” which had thus far made visible
the darkness of Hobart. This proviso still
holds good, though to look at Hobart s street-
lights sometimes you would say it was a pity
the law was not more strictly enforced.
“F II ” • Very sensibly, Victoria’s new
association for the establishment of the silk-
industry is making its pursuit of grub-know-
ledge something of a picnic. The othei
Saturday the members hired a launch and
took a trip to the School of Horticulture at
Burnley, in order to examine the subject on
its native mulberry. There is much to be
said in favor of this kindergarten idea of
picking up hints concerning the production
of green-feed and grubs; and altogether the
nresent experiment promises much better
than any previous one. Thousands of white
mulberry-trees were made available this
vear at Burnley for a shilling a dozen, and
thousands were bought. So the venture is past
the schoolboy-stage of 2doz. grubs in the
woodshed, with a few wilted lettuce-leaves
for sustenance. The Government is taking
a hand, and will presently assist the produ-
cers to market their goods. Of course, if it
were a really up-to-date Government it would
itself provide the market, put in a taftetas-
plant and arrange with the Federal Govern-
ment for a prohibitive duty on imports. Then
the affair would simply boom, because it
costs only about Is. 9d. to start as a silk-
farmer, live-stock and all. And how much
more dignified to sell ourselves our own
dress-lengths of silk than haggle over tup-
pence with a Chinaman .
“D.F.” : lii one respect N. 8. Wales is
luckier than Tasmania. In N. S. Wales, it
seems now, a 21b. loaf of bread must weigh
21b. But in Tasmania the law r says that
21b. loaves must weigh 21b. unless they are
“fancv” bread, in which case they may weigh
any old thing. In country places the bakers
often make nothing but fancy bread, so the
customer must take that or none. _ Encou-
raged by the recent law decision in
N. S. Wales, an agitation has been started
to knock out the “fancy” business altogether
and have all bread sold by weight; and
though Premier Jack Earle has written re-
gretting that the Government has no time
this session for such a trifle, the Municipal
Association proposes to go on kicking.

IMPORTANT.
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort* and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
El DENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
mouth (thus preventing decay).
EL DENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

baId— “CRYSTOLIS” is just the thing for such cases.
This man is fast growing
Here’s good news at last for nien
and women whose hair is falling, who
are growing bald and grey, whose
scalps are covered with dandruff that
nothing seems to keep away, and
whose heads itch like mad.
Good news even for those who im-
agine themselves hopelessly and in-
curably bald, or who suffer from hair
or scalp trouble of any kind.
We have had granted to us the sole
Australasian rights from the great
American discovery, Crystolis, the
new hair remedy that in America and
Europe has been called the most won-
derful discovery of the century, hav-
ing been awarded Gold Medals at the
big Paris and Brussels Expositions.
Hundreds of men and women have
written us to tell of the phenomenal
results obtained by its use. People
who have been bald for years tell how
they now glory in their beautiful hair.
Others who have had dandruff all
their lives say they have now a clean,
healthy scalp, and that hair stopped
falling after a few applications of this
wonderful new treatment.
We don’t care whether you are
bothered with falling hair, prema-
turely grey hair, matted hair, brittle
hair, or stringy hair; dandruff, itch-
ing scalp, or any or all forms of hair
trouble, we want you to try “CR\S-
TOLIS” at our risk.
We give you a binding guarantee,
without any “strings” or red tape,
that it won’t cost you a farthing if we
do not prove to you that “Crystolis”
will do all we claim for it, and, what’s
important, we have plenty of money
to back our guarantee. We have de-
posited £2OO in our local bank as a
special fund to be forfeited if we fail
to comply with this contract.

SHE AND HER DOCS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I liked her well when first we met.
A dress of something under net,
A hat or so, twin eyes of brown,
An air distinctly of the town.
She might have had this heart of mine,
But she’d a dog upon a twine!
We met again. She smiled on me.
'Twas afternoon, and at a “tea”
She looked in white extremely smart.
Once more the offer of a heart
I stooped to make; but, cursed hap,
She had a poodle in her lap !
When next I met her she was sweet,
And down I knuckled at her feet,
Prepared with phrase and fervor grand
To make the offer of my hand.
But when the fist was well in view
Her bullpup snapped and bit it through.
She married Green. AVith feelings grim
1 often sit and gaze on him ;
He’s pale and thin, and hopelessly
Gone to the dogs, as all may see.
I have a dog, a pampered pup—
The well-loved tyke that snapped me up !

More coincidences. Two brothers McKay,
twins, enlisted on the same day, one in Aus-
tralia and one in Maoriland. At Gallipoli
they met by chance; then both were wounded
and forwarded to London. But they lost
one another in the big smoke, and letters
received in Maoriland go to show that one
half of McKay doesn’t know w r hat the other
half is doing.
The Vaughan (S.A.) Government is
going to disregard English precedent and
appoint some new Iv. C’s. There have been no
fresh ones for years, and with Murray now a
Judge, J. 11. Anderson dead, Dashwood re-
tired and Paris Nesbit just resigned there
is a scarcity of silk. The reason for appoint-
ing no new ones in England is that it would
be unfair to men at the Front to give “silk”
to those left behind ; but it doesn’t apply in
S. Aus., where practically all the at-all-
prominent men are behind.
“Camp”: So “Enby” (B. 18/11/’l5)
wants someone to grow wheat in N. S.
Wales farther out than Gongolgon. Well, I
can’t. I’ve tried for three years to grow it
above Dandaloo, 200 miles closer to the rain.
The first year it was too dashed wet to sow
till July, and the crop died in September.
In 1914 I sowed 112 bags and reaped 63.
This year there are 600 acres in and I am
ready to swap the whole output for a good
sheep pup. P.S. —I notice that they propose
to reward returned soldiers by sending them
out here to grow wheat. The patriots!
“Verdad” tells of a transcontinental rail-
way that crawls up 12,000 ft.: —
The Trans-Andine Railway is a narrow-gauge,
English-owned line crossing the Andes from Chile
to Argentine. It supplies a good example of the
centralisation policy, for in Chile, as in Australia,
the big city is out for all the plums. This line
crosses the Andes by the Uspallata Pass, which is
Zt ■; r “ s the bost ’ but happens to be the
p? to the big- Cities Santiago (the capital of
1900 ooa’l, , lnhabitants ) and its port Valparaiso
(-.00,000 inhabitants), not to mention Mendoza on
_ Argentine side. Farther south there are various
very much lower and better passes. Nearly every
winter the Trans-Andine is blocked by snow, in spite
oi the fact that there are miles of snowsheds. The
ine passes through a tunnel near the summit; but
even the tunnel is 12,000 ft. above the sea. This
little fact was overlooked by some harbor engineers
in Chile. They were in a hurry for some barome-
ters, and ordered them from England to be sent
y this route, to save the delay of the sea voyage via
the Magellan Straits. The altitude of the pass was
much above what the barometers were designed for,
and every one arrived disabled. The railway com-
pany owns hotels on the line, and does not neglect
their interests. I remember once the train stopped
24 hours at Puente del Inca (the Inca’s Bridge—a
natural stone arch over a hot stream), and so all
the passengers had to stay at the hotel. Charge:
£1 per head, and the breakfast consisted of coffee
without milk, and dry bread. At Los Andes the
train is timed to connect with the Chilean State
railways, and it probably would if the co. did not
own an hotel there. I was on board when the train
stopped 20 minutes a few miles outside Los Andes,
and then steamed gently into the station as the
State train steamed out. More business for the
hotel!
Lost with all hands off: the Cuban coast,
the British steamer Linda Fell, a well-
known Australian trader. A few years ago,
when Scott Fell scandalised the inter-State
shipping combine by acquiring the contract
to carry ore and coal between Port Pirie and
the Eastern States for the Broken Hill
people, he started to collect a fleet, and
christened the vessels after the Fell family.
He got as far as Myra, Wonga and Linda
when the well-remembered crash came. The
Linda Fell went back to England, and on
September 29 she sailed from Philadelphia
for Cuba. That was the last that was heard
of her. She was the 25th British ship to go
without leaving a solitary trace since Jan.
1, 1915.
“Zadkiel’s Almanac and Ephemeris for
1916” predicts that the first 12 weeks of
the New Year will bring a reduction in the
“flow of human blood,” so if the irrepress-
ible “German offensive” breaks out anew
between now and March 23, the prophet will
look very like a liar. Zad. writes hopefully
of the eclipse of the sun on February 3.
The sun will then be very near the place it
occupied on the date of the Kaiser’s birth ;
hence the suggestion that the eclipse will be
a sign of William’s approaching “dethrone-
ment and death.” But if it merely presages
a heavy fall of bombs on Krupp’s and the
German navy we shall be satisfied, for the
Kaiser, alive or dead, doesn’t matter much
to the war nowadays.
How the habits of our tribe are changing!
Winnington-Ingram, the £lO,OOO-a-year flock-
master of London, affects a slangy, familiar
style—delivers lectures on how to save, and
then leaps into his electric brougham. The
old-style bishop who boomed solemnly
through life would have reduced “W.-I.
London” to a draughty curacy if he had
tried any religious press-agency in business
hours in his diocese. The late Bishop Cam-
idge, of Bathurst, was our finest representa-
tive of the old-style churchman. One day he
was assisted by an abject country station-
master into a railway carriage full of cheer-
ful commercials. There was some slight fuss
over the rearrangement of luggage, and one
of the commercials asked innocently: “And
who might you be, sir?” Then the prelate
drew himself up and blew his trumpet-blast:
“I am Bishop Camidge, the Father of My
Flock.” No vaudeville about that.
The only reason why Maoriland’s High
Commissioner MacKenzie should have been
handed a title is that even as a kid he was
always there first when the parritch was
served o’ mornings, and has since spent most
of his time getting a helping before the
dinner-bell rang. Tammas’s appointment to
the London billet was characteristic. He
was Premier for five minutes or so before
Massey, then Leader of the Opposition, sent
him a wireless—and then Tammas gracefully
faded away in his kilts, and his followers
fell heavily in the tureen. Tom is a stout
person of loud speech and pushing habit,
with small eyes, short, wiry whiskers and
bulging calves, much addicted to making
speeches about pumpkins and the Empire,
and to appearing in public places dressed in
a Tam o’ Shanter and knickerbockers. While
he was giving an imitation of being Premier
the official photographer in Maoriland spent
most of his time snapping him in 47G2 poses.
He is a draper by calling, but induced Cocky
to accept him as an authority on farming.
His brother James is the Dominion’s Sur-
veyor-General.
In connection with the Derby recruiting
scheme the British War Office is issuing
khaki badges of three sorts. The first are
worn by those who have enlisted but are
not yet called to the colors; the second are
to adorn those who wanted to enlist but were
found unfit; the third are fir the discharged
who, through no fault of their own, are of
no use in the fighting ranks. The man of
military age who doesn’t wear one or the
other is a target for white feathers, not to
speak of dead cats. And still Britain won’t
hear of “compulsion” !
Unlike his predecessors, Superintending-
Engineer Derbyshire, of the W.A. end of the
East-and-West line, is doing things. From
December, 1014, till last month he laid 267
miles of track, and is now only 44 miles from
the South Aus. border, occupying a sound
strategic position from which to leap on the
Croweaters. He hasn’t had a strike since
he took charge.
The meek clerk is picking up his courage.
The latest of the species to be upstanding is
he of the wharf, who, from despising the
’orny-’anded lumper and sweating for the
boss when the said ’orny-’anded is on strike
for improved conditions, has come to admire
his fellow-worker’s bond of unionism. Also,
the clerk has become wise to the boss’s bar-
ren return for blisters and strained backs,
and stink and coal-dust, and road-metal and
sundries, so he is after a wages board with
a ticket marked “Wharf Clerks’ Union.”
One of his requests is to be granted the
same meal hours and smokos as the wharf-
laborer —the wharf-laborer whom he has been
encouraged all along to despise as some
inferior sort of beetle.
A beautifully-muddled Anzac gramophone
has pushed itself into history. It occurs in
three principal versions. One is that the
cool Australians who were the last to leave
the advanced trenches put “The Turkish
Patrol” record on the instrument, and, hav-
ing run it off, smashed the machine before
leaving. Another tells how the machine
was left playing the composition, and had
a special bomb attachment fixed up
for the finale. The third is that the
machine wrns left as a compliment
to the Turks with the record ready
fixed so that “The Turkish Patrol” would
be played directly any of the enemy set the
contraption going. Probably when Billjim
gives his version it will come out that it
wasn’t a gramophone at all, but either a
pianola or a mouth-organ.
Evidence at a coroner’s inquest in Sydney:
Sharpe caught her by the throat and threw her
against the table. She lifted a pot of tea to defend
herself, and he covered her with a revolver and told
her he would shoot her if she did not stand back.
That is the lady’s evidence; and the last
clause seems to put the case in a category
with that of a woman who recently com-
plained of assault. She explained that the
man had used insulting language, and gone
to his room and locked the door, but that
subsequently he opened the door and seizing
the poker from her hand pushed her down-
stairs. Ladies who have to be ordered to
stand back or deprived of pokers are toler-
ably numerous. They are also a problem.
A woman’s shout for help gets a lot of sym-
pathy ; but the man who made a similar
noise when pursued by a raging female
would be laughed to scorn. If he takes
strong measures he is a brute: if he doesn’t
he is a worm. On the whole, it seems
almost as well to stay and be a brute as to
run away and be called one.
“O’Phimerty” on an old love-story :
In his verses in the Christmas Bulletin, Henry
Lawson revives an old * legend about the discoverer
of Tasmania: “His sweetheart’s name was in his
heart.” The yarn is that Tasman was in love with
the daughter of Van Diemen, the Dutch governor of
Batavia, and originator of the expedition. That was
supposed to be the explanation of the fact that he
called so much of the landscape Maria. Flinders
first suggested this romantic explanation, but it dies
in the light of research. Tasman was a widower
for the second time, and his family were old enough
to be in love with governors’ daughters themselves.
This entry appears in his journal: “We named Maria
Bay in compliment to the Governor’s wife.” Besides,
Van Diemen had no daughter. These statements are
substantiated by transcriptions of Dutch records pre-
served in Hobart.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
John Packer, whose political career has
been followed with some interest by Mel-
bourne politicians, recently stood for the
Caulfield Council. In 1911 he fell foul of
the Labor party to which he then belonged,
and afterwards stood for “Independence” at
Williamstown, in opposition to Laborite
Lemmon. The result was discouraging;
but, as he had meantime been made secretary
of the Independents at £6 per week, there
was no need for him to go back to work.
In the small Caulfield election he had no
better luck. The prize, for what it was
worth, was won by Robert Phillips, and
that ought to be about the end of Packer.
The Tasmanian Government has the sen-
sible idea of going into the cement-making
business. The Launceston Marine Board
expects to use thousands of tons for ils
Tamar improvement scheme if it can get the
article at a reasonable rate, and it suggests
that the Government might make the stuff
out of the millions of tons of limestone near
the Lower Tamar. The Government wants
a good deal of cement also for its own use,
and the Marine Board would be a customer
for a lot more. Ho far, all the attempts to
start the business in the Speck have failed,
but the fault has not been in the material.
The thing proposed is dreadful Socialism,
of course; but it is the sort of Socialism
that (he hard-headed Broken Hill Prop, goes
in for when, needing a lot of coke, it estab-
lishes its own coke-works.

The old story is told again. This time it
is Professor Allen, of Melbourne University,
who reports to the Council that while disap-
pointing results had followed the use of
imported serum for meningitis patients, the
locally manufactured article has proved
highly efficacious, the mortality at the Mel-
bourne and Children’s Hospitals having
fallen greatly after it was brought into use.
If only somebody would produce a serum to
ward off the importing mania and the nasty
habit of fouling our own nest!
The wonder is that the go-slow policy of
the aristocrats in the British Ministry,
deeply concerned about the feeding of titled
friends who are prisoners of war in Germany,
should have been so long tolerated by the
nation, seeing that influential London papers
could talk in this strain more than two
months ago:—
If India is to be saved arid the Germans defeated
English statesmanship will use English sea-power,
neutrals notwithstanding. We cannot blink the fact
that the Navy has been betrayed. Hundreds of
thousands of tons of the essentials of war have been
allowed to enter Germany. We had the power to
prevent it. We did not exercise the power. There-
fore our war has not prospered.
And all because the Germans threatened
“reprisals” on Lord Algernon Noodle and
Lord Bertie Boodle if the blockade was
pushed to a logical conclusion. “If Ger-
many is to starve the prisoners shall starve
first,” was the Potsdam threat; and Asquith
turned pale, instead of replying that there
were Germans in England. When Jellicoe
persuaded the Admiralty to order that the
murderous submarine pirates should be
treated when captured as criminals rather
than as prisoners of war, what happened?
Potsdam threatened “reprisals” on two or
three dozen captured lordships, and the
Asquith Government promptly cancelled the
Admiralty’s order. A counter threat might
have brought Potsdam to its bearings. But
Asquith isn’t equal lo a counter threat, lie
seems hardly equal to a counter lunch.

The Parliamentary Commission which
Tasmania sent across to the mainland some
months ago to find out, among other things,
whether the Speck really owns a sinking
iiind has made its report. As Tasmania
collects about a million a year and spends
about a million apart from sinking-fund con-
tributions and loan money, the Commission
didnt have much difficulty in deciding that
the alleged sinking fund was bogus. It isn’t
clear how any other fund it may establish
will be much better until the Government
either reduces expenditure or increases re-
venue; but as it is alleged to be a good thing
to assume a virtue even if you haven’t it—
apparently on the ground that it is the dog
with the good name that doesn’t get hanged
—the Commission recommends that a fund
he established and handed over to trustees
in London, who are to be instructed to buy
up the State’s owu securities when they are
cheap and there is any money in the bag.
• 9l ia 1 i . nt old Archdeacon Uindley fulminates
in Melbourne against “Home-grown traitors”
—shirkers, adulterators of soldiers’ food
crooked army contractors, promoters of in-
dustrial strife and so on. "Was there not,”
asked Hindley, “some chosen curse, some
hidden penalty, red with uncommon wrath
to blast the men who owed their success or
riches to their country’s ruin?” Curses are
no good, nor hidden penalties; the only sane
remedy is u rope or a strong gaol. But what
about Carson and Snowball and Hindlev
and all the auti-Home-Rulers who encou-
raged the Germans by talking civil war
because a Constitutional majority had
enaetci l a reform in a proper and constitu-
tional way? What of the 100,000 Ulster-

immediately before the war, but were not

an attack on Free Speech; and free speech
is a corollary of the voluntary military sys-
tem. This system presupposes that men
have the right to discuss the matter of de-
fending their country and coming to an indi-
vidual conclusion; and if free speech is dis-
allowed the alleged voluntary principle be-
comes a sham and maybe a danger, since
the disallowance always means that free
speech is permitted on one side.
In the Vic. Assembly, supporting a pro-
posal for the inclusion of Governor Stan-
ley’s salary among taxable incomes, Labor-
ite Blackburn (Essendon) politely urged
that the Governor “would hardly take it as
a compliment” to be exempt from taxation
at a time like the present. So the Liberals
rallied around the flag and paid Stanley
the compliment by a majority of six votes
-—and presently the Treasury will turn the
compliment into cash, as usual. It’s a good,
democratic beginning to end a tremendous
number of covert rake-offs. The sooner,
for instance, we leave off giving M’s.P. .free
railway tickets, and hand them an extra,
say, £25 a year instead, the sooner we shall
know precisely what our 14 Houses of
Parliament and our 800 or so legislators
cost us. We never shall know until we
knock off all these surreptitious extras.
Jones, Labor M.L.C. for Melbourne East,
the other day quoted General McCay to
Honorary Minister Bill Baillieu, who repre-
sents the Peacock Ministry in the Council,
and asked him a few questions as to the
intentions of the Government in regard to
McCay’s “noble drapers”—the men who,
McCay alleges, “want to make a war-profit
out of women who knit socks for soldiers.”
Bill Baillieu coldly replied (1) that he
wasn’t aware of the practice mentioned;
(2) that he didn’t know the names of the
persons concerned; (3) that no offence was
disclosed ; and (4) that the Ministry would
not be justified in taking legal proceedings.
Then the incident .closed ; and the Fat Land-
lords went on with their little labors in
peace, secure in the knowledge that they
are not returned by the women who knit
socks for soldiers, and that, when the soldier
comes back from the war, even he won’t as
a rule have a vote either. That’s the sort of
House the Leg. Council is!
Nearly 20 years ago a syndicate called the
Great Western undertook to build 100-odd
niiles of railway to link Hobart up with the
West Coast (Tas.), in return for seven
blocks of Crown land of not more than 70,000
acres each along the line, or nearly 500,000

of £lO,OOO, and spent about £50,000 in sur-
veys and earthworks and then snuffed out
leaving the Tasmanian Government richer
the £lO,OOO deposit which was duly for-
feited. The other day Henry Jones, the
jam man, and S. P. Fitzgerald, who is
chairman of the Cascade Brewery Co dug
up the scheme and told the State Govern-
ment that they would put the line through
on the syndicate’s terms. It was a tempt-
ing offer, for there isn’t Buckley’s chance of
for n bt f te h f- dlng the m °ney for the work
toi a long time to come, and till the line
is built the State isn’t likely to get much
revenue out of the 500.000 acres. PrSer

When Joseph Parker, the English parson
with the silver voice and the histrionic-
ha bits, shocked the Nonconformist conscience
by concluding an eloquent sermon with the
words “In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost. I
say God damn the Sultan,” he was.

W r heat grown in the dry Back-
blocks absorbs moisture when
brought down for its sea-trip—any-
thing from \ per cent, to 3 per
cent. This accretion in weight of
course benefits the dealer, who buys
dry at the up-country railway sta-
tion and sells the moisture as wheat
on the other side. Allowing only
1 per cent, increase in an export of
20.U<X),000 bushels, you have
200,000 bushels more to sell than
you bought; and 200,000 bushels at
(say) 6s. —it is a lot more than
that now—means £60,000. What
Sosh is doing for the Australian cocky this
years the cocky could do for himself every
year by co-operation. Why don’t the De-
partments of Agriculture help by organising
him ‘!
Australian wheat-cockies are meeting their
friend Pirate Enterprise again, and as
usual he smiles and smiles and robs them
while he smiles. A few months ago, when
there were signs of a shortage of wheat-bags,
the N. S. Wales Government began to nose
around and looked like taking a Socialistic
hand in the business. “Oh, no, you leave it
to us,” said the jute merchants—“we’ll see
that there are sacks enough.” So the Gov-
ernment left the farmers to their old friend —
with the result that last week the jute mer-
chants, talking of a short supply, ran the
price up to 9s. 3d. per dozen. If, after that,
Cocky leaves this business of bags to Pirate
Enterprise he will deserve all he gets.
There is hardly anything that could be more
easily handled by co-operation; and the
Agricultural Department which doesn’t pro-
mote that movement doesn’t know the first
thing about the promotion of successful land
settlement.
The other day there was a howl from one
end of Maoriland to the other because of a
shortage of clothes pegs. The price of those
on hand went shooting skyward, the news-
papers bemoaned the fact that the things
were in short supply, and Martha Washing-
ton had to resort to the gooseberry bush to

THE AWAKENING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At last the word is spoken. England strives
Henceforth with ordered purpose, and her blow
Kails heavy-weighted on the restless foe
Sinewed with ali the force of all the lives
That make a nation. At the bugle call,
With even march and unaffrighted tread,
Her host moves forward where her foremost dead
In dying made a beacon-light for all.
Long in the hollow place of doubt remained
The might that once was Britain’s, while the Hate
That winged the bolts of death with pride elate
Dreamed of that power with custom’s fetters
chained
Past hope of all uprising. Now the chill
Grey sky of morning echoes to the cheer
That heralds the broad march to victory clear
When freedom’s eldest champion finds her will.
Force facing force in equal ranks and arms,
Our strength of manhood puts their Hate to shame.
The undimmed glory of a mighty name
Flames through the thunder-cloud, and war’s
alarms
Beat on the proud front of our moving hosts
Like flying spray against a granite shore.
The dream comes true; the age-long sleep is o’er;
In pride of deeds the world forgets our boasts.

STOMACH WORMS.
A MENACE TO CHILDREN.
Stomach worms are undoubtedly the most
invidious kind of all. They inhabit the
stomach and inflict great havoc upon their
victim. They deprive the victim of half the
nutriment he consumes, and when the
stomach is empty gnaw the sides of the
stomach, causing such terrible sensations
as to often cause faintness. Aperient medi-
cines have no effect upon them, for when
any purgative is taken they fasten them-
selves to the walls of the stomach by a
groove running down their side. The Lest
method of dislodging stomach worms is to
starve the system and take Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets. The worms are
weakened by the want of food and are in-
duced to eat whatever is taken into the
stomach. Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm
Pellets contain the properties which sicken
and disable the worms, and a dose of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills will clear them out
of the system.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal prepara-
tion for the eradication of worms in children
and adults. For sale by all chemists and
storekeepers, price 3s. C>d. per packet, or
will be sent post paid at the same price by

Street, Church Hill, Sydney.— Advt.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
A bushman comes back unconvinced :
In spite of all their talk about horse-mastering, I
still say the military seat on a saddle is wrong. It’s
too stiff and rigid. The man becomes a burden. To get
the most out of a horse you must sit loose and give
with his movement. You must become part of him.
Men in the back country can get more out of an
uncleaned grass-fed than these “horse-masters” can
out of their cleaned and corn-fed prads. The rigid
seat has a tendency to make a man ride on a horse's
m@uth, and that is the limit. The animal should
have his head as free as possible. Just feel him
with the ribbons, and that’s all. His head is his
balance. Watch mobs of him galloping loose on
wet grass or slipper}' claypan and see how the head
manoeuvres when he’s swinging. There’s other things.
For instance, a lot of sore backs. Never put padding
where the scar is. Most people do. Put your pad-
ding anywhere but on the sore. For an old or new
mark on the backbone —caused by a badly-channelled
saddle —take the saddle-cloth or anything else handy
and roll it up from both sides, leaving flaps to lay
bare on his ribs. Your rolls will then be up under
the seat, lifting the channel up from off his back-
bone. The cloth touches, but there’s no pressure,
and the sore will heal while you’re riding. If you
get a chance, wash his back down with cold water.
For girth-galls put a crupper on and let the girth
out a couple of holes. You can make a crupper out
of anything. The other cove’s belt is an easy one.
You can ride a cruppered horse with the girths flap-
ping, if you’re any good.
Billjim, wounded, rolled up at the
Gazierah races on November 11, and when some
officers of the Bulldog breed saw some of him limp-
ing up to the tote with quids they burst into sur-
prise and said “Haw !” . They can’t get out of the
poisonous habit of thinking that if a man had money
he couldn’t be in the ranks. It was a queer sort of
meeting, and when an Australian troophorse came in
first with a Caulfield amateur on top and claimed
the Cup, and officialdom found out that “Miv Lang-
don” was Private Langdon, there was a long debate.
But the most important thing was that Billjim
collected 65 piastres for an investment of 4s.—•
otherwise a div. of 13s. After that The Bulletin’s
correspondent isn’t as lucid as he might be. As far
as this paper can make out, for the Stray Comforts
Handicap there was a field of 726, and after 14 false
starts the horses taxied for the post. Then there was
a protest against the winner, Israel’s Pride, on the
ground that the animal carried 3st. overweight, and
was paying a dividend of 6000 piastres, which wasn’t
quite a fair thing. The protest was upheld, and
after the backers of the winner in the first race had
received the D.C.M. for using Australese, the event
was run again. Also, the stewards said that the
winner might as well be let have another go, and
the tote was reopened where it left off, and everyone
rushed in to put piastres on the old winner. There
was a field of 826 in the run-off, but Israel’s Pride
won some more, and there was a dividend of 24d.,
and the proprietor of the machine refused to pay
out because all the tickets were forgeries. Where-
upon a stranger from Bananaland asked somebody to
have another drink; and a happy day ended with
1945 fights.
Racing at Flemington on New Year’s Day
would have been quite satisfactory to many punters
if Klinger had got home in the Bagot Handicap.
But Klinger (7st. 61b.), being in an unkind mood, or
an awkward horse to manage, or being injudiciously
ridden, finished a bare half-head behind Sylvanmore
(9st.). The big black horse had seemed out of form
for some time, but on Saturday, making his run
early and sticking close to his job, he reasserted
himself as one of the best. In the Standish Handicap
flutter the improved Eurobin scored handsomely in
accordance with his performance at Caulfield on
Boxing Day. Eurobin is a hard, brown gelding, with
only one or two little flecks of white on him, and
appearances suggest that he might win a good race
over a distance if he were lightly trained. When he
ran six furlongs at Caulfield in lmin. 13sec. he was
quite fresh from the paddock, so he can’t be a nag
that wants an old-fashioned preparation for any race.

Cheap-priced prads continue to bob up in
the big events, Foil (Summer Cup winner) was
exchanged last year for 125 guineas; Pillotos (W.A.
Derby) brought only 225 guineas as a yearling ; and
Jckle Lass (Carrington Stakes) changed hands for a
miserable 40 guineas. #
Sydney Tatt.’s Cup is passing the mile-
stones. It drifted into history in 1866, when the
hardware ( £250) and cash ( £200) were regarded as
notable; nowadays the race is worth £l2OO. ror
44 years the event was run-off over two miles; in
the last half-dozen years it has been cut down to a
mile and a half.
“Musketoon”: At Bicton (W.A.) trotting
meeting a few days ago a syndicate quietly dribbled
£l6 amongst the stay-in-town bookmakers on Erin
for a place at tote odds in the Trotting Purse. Erin
paid a dividend of £4 2s. 6d. for 55., so the book-
makers had to return £264 for the £l6. It might
have been worse, however. It was necessary that at
least one ticket should be taken out on Erin on the
course, and the bloque entrusted with this task was
told to leave the investment until the last moment.
He did leave it until pretty late, but not quite
late enough, for two women saw him purchasing the
ticket, and between them they bought two more. But
for this the dividend on Erin would have been
£l2 7s. 6d., and the bookmakers, instead of losing
£264, would have been £744 the poorer. Since their
escape the books have fixed a starting-price odds-
limit of 20 to 1. # #
At the Port Adelaide Christmas meeting
a useful dividend of £45 10s. was paid on the
Hurdle Race. This is not out-of-the-way high; the
pleasant feature was that there was enough left to pay
35s. —or nearly level money—to those who backed
the second. * * *
Tasmanian sports got away with a win-
ning double on New Year’s Day: (1) Pubs hence-
forward close at 10 p.m. instead of the unholy
11.30 ; (2) Ikey McPalestine was sent down and out
by the totalisator.

William Duggan, who died at Randwick
last week at 56, was in Tom Lamond’s stable when
Tom trained for Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of
New South Wales in the ’7o’s. In 1873 Duggan had
the mount on Vixen, and in the following year t
Speculation, both horses being Sydney Cup winners.
As a trainer he won the A.J.C. Derby in ’97 with
Amberite (a son of Carbine), and the Vic. Derby
and Caulfield Cup the same year, and the V.R.C.
Champion Stakes the following year. He trained
Correze, winner of the A.J.C. Leger, and ran third
in Carbine’s famous Cup.
Racehorses are sometimes horribly over-
worked at a certain class of “meeting” in the north
half of Maoriland. At Tauranga recently there were
only 16 nags to scramble for the thin helping of
cash attached to eight events. One appeared in five
races; the others averaged three each. Even worse
sweating occurred at an awful place called Waipapa-
kauri by people whose tongues can manage it. There
were six events, and 11 horses had the whole thing
to themselves. What kind of prads they were can
be gathered from this, that the affair, decorated
with the alias of Racing Club, offers £25 as an in-
ducement to hurry up in the “big” race. The local
inhabitants call it the Cup!
FRANK DEMPSEY, Victoria's 16-year-old
star-won last Caulfield Cup on Lavendo.
One of the unlooked-for results of the
extra ha’penny postage war-tax in Maoriland has
been to increase the already heavy expenses of the
remaining Ikeys who carry on a precarious, guerilla-
like business in well-fortified dugouts. Half a brown
apiece on cards added to the cost of shifting quarters
every time the post-office authorities get wise has
made Ikey study more economy, and some of him
have issued a circular to clients commencing: “At
one time you were a good and valued client of mine,
but for some time I have not had the pleasure of
doing any business with you whatever.” Then fol
lows the cold remark that if business is not forth-
coming promptly, Ikey won’t spend any more three-
ha'pences sending cards that way.
Jimmy Clabby (U.S.A.) and Mick King
(N.S.W.) commenced the year by struggling to land
a punch in the proper place at Sydney Stadium,
and as James couldn’t land it and Michael had, as
usual, neglected to bring one along with him, the
affray raged to the bitter end. Whereupon Arthur
Scott placed his hand on the head of Jjgmes and
everyone said it was a fair thing. There was nothing
to cable to the War Office about, though—just a good
set-to between a pair of exceptionally clever boxers.
So far as skill with the gloves is concerned these
two men are quite the best in Australia to-day, but
neither owns much devastation. Had they done so
Mick would not have weathered the storm,” for there
were times when he was feeling very sore and
troubled in spirit. But he cheerfully took what
came his way, and again showed that he has in his
kit all a pug requires to climb the pathway of
success except one thing—a wallop. Mick with a
thump would make cold meat of Clabby any day in
the week. As it is, James makes hash of him.
* * * *
Blew Edwards, the English featherweight,
who trimmed up Jimmy Hill in good style at Syd-
ney, went up to Brisbane last week, and on Satur-
day preached George Taylor a sermon, finishing the
eighthly with an unfriendly left-handed upper-cut
followed by the same thing with the right. Where-
upon George suddenly became so tired that he went
to sleep, and when he woke up Edwards had gone.
In the first three rounds Taylor showed out to
advantage and rattled the visitor with weighty left
swings to the head and rips to little Mary. But by
the fourth cotillion Edwards had summed up Tay-
lor’s style to a nicety, and set out to finish the
entertainment. Thereafter it was easier for a fat man
to push a camel through the eye of a needle than it
was for Taylor to punch the will-o’-the-wisp from
Wales. In the seventh, as Taylor sent out a left
swing that might have shaken the German Empne
had it landed, Edwards skipped out of range, and
dancing back like lightning landed five successive
blows in different places before Ta} r lor had recovered
from his own mighty effort. Then as they closed in
Edwards jolted Taylor’s jaw with a snappy short
right, and the Australian dropped to the mat. When
he rose Edwards cracked the right to the jaw again,
and this time Taylor took the full count. The
Stadium was jambed so full that a hundred or so
had to stand in the aisles to watch the slaughter of
the innocent. Unless Humphries or Spargo can up-
end him it looks as if the pallid Englishman is going-
right through.
“Ivnock-out” Brown, an imported tornado
from Chicago (U.S.A.), is solemnly working up his
muscles for a go with Les Darcy in Sydney next
week. Incidentally, he is giving his sparring part-
ners beans. Mr. Brown is a person with a smite
that falls due like a p.n., and those who accept
delivery thereof are understood to never yearn for
any more. Brown’s record reads like the biography
of an executioner. If he can whirl the J'oung Mait-
lander up to the stars great will be his renown in
the Land of Biff. But if he doesn’t manage it he
will get hurt in the trying.
* * * *
“Slug”: Les Darcy says that Eddy
McGoorty is the hardest hitter and Jimmy Clabby
the cleverest and best boxer he has met. Clabby
opines that McGoorty is the hardest hitter, Fritz
Holland the cleverest, Darcy the toughest, and
Darcy and Gibbons equal as the best he has met.
McGoorty thinks Jack Doherty the hardest hitter,
Clabby the cleverest, Young Mahoney the toughest,
and Les Darcy the best he has exchanged stoush
with. Fritz Holland votes Clabby the cleverest, Kid
George (California) the hardest hitter (he has not
met McGoorty), Ike Cohen the toughest, and Les
Darcy the best all-rounder in his lot. Dave Smith
says McGoorty is the hardest hitter, Clabby the
cleverest, and Darcy the greatest middle-
weight in the world, which, in the circumstances, is
the thing you’d naturally expect him to say.
From Brisbane: The committee of the
patriotic fund has pressed an illuminated address on
“Snowy” Baker, in recognition of the hard work
he put into the entertainment organised by him at
the Stadium in 1915. Mr. Baker is visiting Brisbane
in connection with the scheme now on foot for build-
ing a stadium at the military camp at Enoggera.
Jess Willard, the Yank who knocked out
Johnson, received the worst kind of an advertise-
ment in Los Angeles last month in a battle of words
with Harry Houdini, “the handcuff king.” When
Houdini invited a committee on the stage to assist
him in one of his tricks he suggested that Willard
should accompany them. The pug retorted that he
would if Houdini paid him at the same rate as the
others. Whereupon the audience, resenting the tone
of Willard’s remarks, gave him the bird good and
strong. Taken off his feet for the moment Willard
lost his head and called the magician a four-flusher
and a faker. Then with the house in an uproar
Houdini dashed to the footlights and challenged Wil-
lard to come on the stage and settle things, at which,
after throwing some more insulting remarks about,
the cowboy was hooted out of the theatre.

Oorri, the famous referee, has been telling
London how Jimmy Bffett provided a joyous laugh
against him (Corri). Brett narrated that Corri,
after rebuking him for sticking in the game when
he was “a pugilist on the down-grade, looking very
old” (Corri was pulling the bright-eyed, immaculate
Jimmy’s leg), invited him to lunch. At the next
table was a party of three. Presently one of the
girls, casting an eye on Corri, asked her male friend
who he was. “That,” explained the informative
friend, “is a pugilist.” “Is he married?” “Oh, yes;
that gentlemanly, clean-shaven little fellow with him
is his son.”

When making an appeal to the public to
attend the New Year’s cricket match at the M.C.C.
for the benefit of the wounded, ex-Attorney-General
Donald Mackinnon, president of the Vic. Cricket
Ass., threw some light on a matter which has been
considerably discussed by the public of late—the
attitude of the “flannelled fool” towards the various
recruiting schemes. It appears from Mackinnon’s
remarks that the flannelled one is no fool, after all,
in war matters, since 2235 players under the
V.C.A.’s metropolitan jurisdiction are already in uni-
form, military hospitals or soldiers’ graves.
“F.C.”: Re “Jackar’s” inquiry (B.
23/12/’l5) about the boys of the old Bendigo
cricketing brigade. Jack Blackham is still alive,
and pushed himself into prominence on the day
“Jackar’s” par. appeared by getting a yield of
68oz. of gold from a four-ton crushing. The claim he
is working, with a mate, is at Panton Hill—
scratchy, patchy country between Eltham and Queens-
town, out beyond Heidelberg.
Rex Kyffin Thomas, chief-of-staff of Adel-
aide Register, killed in a motor-accident a little
more than a year ago, was a keen bowler, and he is
to be commemorated at the Adelaide Bowling Club’s
green by an annual trophy for Pairs. His old friend
Abe Shannon has endowed it handsomely, and also
provided a Tasmanian blackwood tablet, with por-
trait, to hang in the club-house.
“T.F.”: N.S.W. Anniversary Regatta is
maturing. It started out in 1837, and will there-
fore celebrate its four-score birthday on January 26.
In its initial 17 years it was a many-sided show’; but
the section of it which is still reverently handed to
posterity first appeared on the bill in 1860, when
amateur events crept in and Champion Fours was
the titbit of the day. Some of the athletes of the
early races are still on deck and hearty. Of those
who took part in the 1862 regatta Q. L. Deloitte
(N.S.W.R.A. president) had a seat in one of the
fours, and Gerald Fitzhardinge (now a Ma State
Judge) had an oar.
A veteran sportsman, handing over his
glasses in answer to Colonel Ramaeiotti’s appeal for
binoculars at Randwick recently, said with a smile:
“If you see as many dead Germans as I’ve seen
dead ’uns through ’em we’ll win this war all right.”
At the New Norfolk (Tas.) Regatta on
Boxing Day H. Hope, a 9st. 101 b. lightweight from
the Sandy Bay Rowing Club, led off by stroking the
winning crew in the maiden long fours. Less than
an hour afterwards he stroked the winners of the
maiden short fours over a very gruelling 24 miles
course. After 45 minutes’ rest he stroked a
maiden eight-oared crew, and was making a strong
*?. r that race too when a collision put him out
of action and spoilt his record.

A N. S. Wales sportsman on New' Year’s
Eve provided a suggestion for one of Fred Brown’s
w,,lpF 111 Sheol. He was out shooting
rabbits with a pea-rifle at Perthville (near Bathurst),
and while stooping down to examine a hollow log
a bunny flew from the aperture, struck up the weapon
and exploded it. The bullet entered the man’s body
just below the heart and killed him.

Someone has been comparing the motor
rush of Armstrong, Foster and co. from west to east
across Australia with the slickest dash across U.S.A.
Let us see brethren. From Fremantle to Sydney is
said to be’ 3289 miles. The trip was done in eight
days 23hrs. 40min., an average daily run of 365
miles. And there are many heaps of difficulties in
the wav. The distance from ’Frisco to N’Yark is
3557 miles. The best time for that jaunt was made
when L. L. AVhitman dashed it in 10 days 15hrs.
13min. —330 miles per day, or 35 miles less than
Armstrong and eo. negotiated. Both performances,
of course, are wonderful, and show to what perfec-
tion car construction has been brought in the last
few years. Now if the Fremantle-Sydney run had
only been accomplished in a ’Stralian-built vehicle
there would be something to throw a chest about!

A good motor-cycling ride this. J. Cecil
Rice started awav from Peak Hill (N.S.AV.) during
the Christmas holidays. Travelling via Grenfell,
Wallendbeen, Junee and Wagga he landed at Cum-,
beroona, next door to Albury, the same afternoon.;
Distance, 304 miles ; riding time, 104 hours. He*'
dismounted three times —Grenfell for breakfast, .Tunee
for lunch, and just outside Junee on account of slight
engine troubles.

Erwin S. Baker, a Yankee motor-cyclist,
the other day knocked 154 minutes off W. King’s
record for the Hobart-Launceston run (122 miles),
reducing the time from 2 hours 53 minutes to 2
hours 374 minutes. Even then he spent 20 minutes
on the way hunting for the air valve of his carbu-
retter. * * *
Champions continue to receive unkind
treatment in Dollarland. This time cyclist Kramer
was the recipient and Australian R. J. McNamara
attended to the delivery of the goods. The occasion
was a five-mile tandem-paced match between the two
at Newark. McNamara, who was full of ginger,
began to howl at his pacemakers from the start, and
at the end of two miles when new pacers came on
they started to haul him along at a great clip.
Kramer’s men were able to produce the same speed,
but the Yank wasn’t equal to the task of clinging to
them. The Australian, going full steam ahead, lapped
Kramer, which is a feat no one on earth has ever
accomplished before, and had another quarter of a
lap up his sleeve when he flashed across the line in
Bmin. 56 2-ssec., a world’s record for the distance
with tandem-pacing. The last mile was kicked off
in lmin. 41see., which was a terrific pace to main-
tain at the end of such a five-mile burst of speed.
» * * *
Australian cyclists made a great splash in
the 314-mile teams race (point system) at Newark
(U.S.A.) last month, when F. C'orry and G. Walker
won from Goullet and Grenda and Spears and
McNamara. Kramer and J. Clark (Aus.) finished
fifth.
In the whiz for the As tor Cup recently
on the wooden track at Sheepshead Bay, Long Island
(U.S.A.), 20 fast ears steered by 20 reckless dare-
devils went out to pursue each other 175 times round
the two-mile track to earn the cup, collar the cash
dangling from it and acquire the honor. De Resta,
as usual, went out favorite, and rushed to the front,
tearing along at about 105 miles an hour. With
half the 350 miles covered he had the field lapped
and the race practically won; but while the others
were looking like two cents the connecting rod in one
of the cylinders of his engine broke. Therefore the
Frenchman joined the “also started,” and the cup-
went to Anderson, driving a Yankee-built car, who *
arrived in 3hrs. 24min. 42see. —102.6 miles per
hour, and the world’s best in competition for a race
of over 100 miles. Over 100,000 spectators parted
with dallers to see the dash —and wait for the smash.

Policeman W. J. O’Reilly had a day out
at the Highland Gathering at Sydney on Saturday.
He won the 161 b. stone throw, the 161 b. hammer cast
and the caber toss. On the same day Cockatoo Island
police won the tug-of-war. Recent jousts with the
restive soldiers have been rounding off John Hop’s
muscles.

“First Bag”: All hope of N.S.W. Base-
ball Association—the winter controller of the game—
making good its foolhardy decision to disqualify
players who take part in the “National” (or sum-
mer) programme, is vanishing. Excepting Alan
Kipnax and Tommy Andrews (who are playing
cricket), Sydney topnotch players are under the
“National” banner; and as the latter body has
secured affiliation with the ’Murkan authorities, the
B.A. is cut off from oversea fixtures. The next stage
of the fight will be the launching of an all-the-vear-
round premiership by the National League, and a
sorrowful Ass. will awaken to the fact that it has
wagged its ears and looked fierce in vain.
It has been a bad year for champions, and
they continue to be walked over with great regu-
larity. The latest to be trampled on is Miss
Bjurstedt, champion lady tennis “singles” of U.S.A.
In their match the score-sheet of Mrs. Wightman
read 6 —l, 6—4.
THE WOWSER TRAINING-CAMP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One day when I was far from home and my green-
shaded lamp
I stumbled suddenly upon a wowser training-camp.
Two wowsers leaped and rushed beneath two heavy
muffled bells,
And as they tugged the hemp-ropes they emitted
silent yells.
Two wowsers with tame devils fought and slammed
them for their sins ;
They smote their partners ’neath the belt and kicked
their sooty shins.
Some wowsers yelled in unison the dreariest of
hymns
’Neath hopeless hats of deepest black with very
narrow brims.
A wowser lying on his back gnashed for the Lord
his teeth.
There was a varnished heap of buns, and he was
underneath.
Some frantic wowsers poured out tea. A hose each
teapot fed ;
And from the cups (all bottomless) the streaming
tannin fled.
A sound of banging Bibles drowned at intervals the
sport,
And wowsers leaped for joy each time they heard
a loud report.
Grim blots with brass collection-plates about the
landscape stalked,
Begging donations from the birds and ev’ry cow that
walked.
Some got jaw-muscles up for prayer by gnawing at
tall trees,
And others stooped to make their pants look holy at
the knees.
I did not want to see the rest. Continuing my tramp,
I very quickly left behind that wowser training-camp.

Tooth Paste.
If our teeth could talk—they
would say something like this:
“Yes, we are thankful for our
friends —the millions of Tooth
Brushes. They do a splendid
work—so far as they go. We
are grateful for the hundreds of
dentifrices. They in turn do a
splendid work—so far as they go.
But both together fall far short of
protecting our enamel—our only
weapon of tooth protection. Is
there no escape from these
‘MOUTH AClDS’—these ever-
present mouth fluids which, un-
seen, unbidden, are working day
and night to break down our
armor plate—and then make the
soft inside tooth structure easy
prey to decay-germs?”
We answer:
“There IS escape from ‘Acid
Mouth.’ Pebeco Tooth Paste is
the one dentifrice to-day which
prevents ‘Acid Mouth’—the direct
cause of 95 % of all tooth-decay.”

“Deficit” in a case of this kind means capi-
tal not represented by tangible assets; and
the figures in the last line under that head-
ing are arrived at as follows: —
Goodwill of Herald and Weekly Times,.. £198,000
Less Formal Reserve •• ..£65,000
Contingency Account. . .. 60,000
Dividend Equalisation Fund 20,000
P. and L. balance .. .. 1,313
149,010
Deficit as above .. •• ..£48,687
But, notwithstanding that £48,687 of the
capital is still unrepresented by tangible
assets, the directors have decided on capital-
ising £125,000 of the reserves mentioned
above. “These funds,” the directors say, re-
ferring to the formal Reserve and the Con-
tingency accounts, “are the accumulations
made during many years’ operations for the
purpose of strengthening_the co.’s position.
They are largely invested in the business... ..
and form part of the co.’s working capital.
The directors desire that this should be per-
manent.” They therefore intend to form a
new co., giving the ordinary shareholders
two shares for one. That will make the
total of ordinaries 250,000 of £1 each. Prefs.
will of course receive only share for share.
But as the directors say:—
The position and security of the pref. shareholders
are strengthened by this conversion of the reserves
into capital, as under existing conditions such reserves
might be distributed among the ordinary share-
holders, with the resulting reduction in the assets of
the co.
Of course there was another plan. That
was to use up the reserves in writing down
intangible goodwill. As the first table
shows, the whole amount and a lot more
could be absorbed that way. This would
have suited the prefs. still better. It would
have made it just as impossible to divide
the reserves among the ordinaries. _And
there would still have been only 125.000
ordinaries to feed with dividends instead of
250,000, with the result that more assets
would be likely to remain undivided. How-
ever, the object of it all is quite well known
to every investor. The new scheme isn’t
designed to improve the position of the prefs.,
but is merely to permit a greater amount of
profit to be cut up among the ordinaries
without putting up the rate of dividend any
higher. In fact, the directors know that it
will be an advantage if they can divide 25
p.c. more among the ordinaries and show the
dividend as only 9 p.c. instead of the present
15 p.c.
The investor who wants to,see his princi-
pal represented by hard cash or something,
which can be surely converged into hard
cash without loss will pass.this very profit-
able co. This shows how it stands: —

Liquid assets ..50,902 84,147 74,289 69,019 72.203
The present capital is £250,000; and free-
holds, stock and liquid assets represent
£171,246. Deduct liabilities, and £168,324
is left. There is machinery in addition ; but
most of the value of the machinery lies in
goodwill. There is thus a big gap between
the realisable tangible assets and the co.’s
capital; and there is a lot bigger gap be-
tween those assets and the market value of
the shares. The gap represents goodwill—
what the public is paying for the business.
It is a good deal of money; for a newspaper
is very rarely built upon a rock.
The public, by the way, has an idea that
papers must be coining money now out of
their war-circulation. There is more in the
circulation of a small evening paper
like the Melbourne Herald than in
a big morning bundle like the Syd-
ney Herald, each being sold at the
same penny. But there isn’t a great deal
in circulation, anyway, and the extra revenue
from sales is more or less counterbalanced
by extra cost of paper. Australia’s chief,
almost sole, sources of supply are Scandin-
avia and North America. The Scandinavian
supply is seriously affected by the trouble
in the North Sea; the American supply is
almost equally affected by freights which
for ordinary “news” paper now amount to
about 75 per cent, of the cost of the stuff at
port of shipment.

“Glassy Glance”: Some of the men inter-
ested in the Stanthorpe (Q.) tin-dredging
industry will emerge poorer if not wiser.
The reason is simple. Mines with modest
possibilities were boomed and over-capital-
ised. Companies were floated to buy them
on the stories of very unreliable old inhabi-
tants, and on the reports of still more un-
reliable and inefficient “experts.” On top
of that came unintelligent management.
Some managers have been selected on their
pick-and-shovel abilities; some did not even
possess that virtue; others again on refer-
ences given to them by people who were
darned pleased to thus politely write them
off One tragic specimen holds references
that would get him the mismanagement of
. the best dredge in the Commonwealth, and
at the present time I am watching another

Which Piano Shall I Buy?
The question becomes increasingly perplexing on each
announcement of fresh agencies for imported pianos, never
previously represented in Australia, all advertised as “the
best” and specially selected to replace the cheap German
pianos, which, although still advertised, for an obvious
reason, are now unobtainable —thanks to the British Navy.
Apart from “patriotic reasons” Beale Pianos and
Beale Player-Pianos, made in Australia, have chief claim
to your confidence. They are manufactured specially to
suit Australian conditions, and for general excellence are
quite unequalled. Their popularity is not due to the
patriotic feeling engendered by the war, but on account of
their unsurpassed tonal quality, undoubted durability and
beautiful appearance. Over three times as many Beale
Pianos were sold before the war as any other make of
imported piano, and the steady, constant rise in the sale of
the more expensive models—horizontals, player-pianos and
uprights—proves the growing appreciation of the dis-
criminating musicaU class in Australia who demand
superlative quality.
Beale Pianos are sold for cash or on easiest possible
terms, and we make full allowances for old instruments in
part payment.
Beale Pianos do not have to support importers’
enormous charges nor Customs duty (40%, or 8/- in the £),
but are delivered direct from the factories to your home.

IT
A FACT.
Our bread is now made by most modern
methods, which rob it of the nourishing
constituents, and is the chief cause of
Fermentative Dyspepsia.
Continued eating of fresh white bread
causes acute indigestion, with all its
accompanying ailments, wind, acid ris-
ings, bad memory, sour stomach, consti-
pation, headache. Of. course, hard physi-
cal workers throw off these ailments, but
people living sedentary lives cannot over-
come them, and they fall into bad health
and feel very wretched. If you have
indigestion in any form take a course
of Fisher’s Phospherine half an hour
after meals and you will soon feel well
and look on the bright side of life.

“Alamon” (who lives on the spot)
When the fourth contingent (some 40-odd) reached
Enoggera Camp (Q.) from the Northern Territory
they were admitted without a second medical inspec-
tion (the first had been made at Darwin) because,
according to the commanding officer at the camp,
only 2J/-carat men come from the Territory. A num-
ber of these fellows were Territory-born, but had
dodged the awful climate by living with it from
infancy.
Although the Yankee has put little ginger
into his national protests against the kicks
he has received from Mexico, Germany and
Austria, he does many other things with
a vigor. In 1895 oil was found in the
Indian Territory, now the State of Okla-
homa. That year 37 barrels were sold. In
1914 the output was 100,000,000 barrels;
besides, 58 million bushels of wheat were
harvested, and coal was won to the extent
of million tons. Now it is getting
ready to found a great iron and steel
industry. Meantime a continent of almost
the same size as the whole U.S., probably
richer in natural resources, and blessed with
a less rigorous climate and at least as much
fertile land, has slumbered along with its
five million-odd inhabitants, apparently
Quite convinced that it will be allowed to do
so for all time. It may be that the war will
bring home to the Australian mind the fact
that it is time for every individual to get
busy, and honestly and systematically devote
his energy to making this empty land pro-
ductive, so that it may be filled with a suffi-
cient population to defend itself in time of
need. If it does, to us it will be worth the
cost.
During a discussion on the Wheat Market-
mg lull iu the Vic. Assembly Malcolm
McKenzie struck trouble when scoffing at a
Kabor proposal for considering the consumer
as well as the middleman. “The price of
winch wheat is sold,” said Malcolm didacti-
cally, must regulate the price of bread.”
Martin Hannah interjected that unfortu-
nately it didn’t. Well, it doesn’t; so Mal-
colm went hastily on to the next bump. “It
is impossible,” lie declared, with even greater
finahty in Ins tone, “to differentiate between
the price of flour for export and the price
for home consumption.” Hogan, of Warren-
co “ tr , adicted that. But John
Garlisle (Benalla), a country-party pal of
McKenzie s, explained the matter. While
■inrJi 1 ' f lo^ l ( i°2 1 8umptioi ! l brings the miller
a profit of about fl a ton, “a miller will take
a contract for export that might give onlv
os. or 4s. profit—owing to keen competition.’’
it is a confusing, unsatisfactory state of
thc iocai
THE SUFFERING POLE’S.
Brave Russia will rally
And revenge the lost souls
And the harrowing grief
Of the suffering poles,
Whom were driven like cattle
By the merciless huns
And their homesteads destroyed
By their thundering guns.
Brave russia will rally
And revenge the lost souls
And God will be with em
For the suffering pole's.


OSCILLATING PORTAL WALL BEDS

WRITING DESK AND WALE BED.
The slightest pull of the handle reveals the bed, with
bedding intact.
The WALL BED
has come to stay.
Stationary Beds are beginning to be
a thing of the past, because they
take up too much room, and the
public here, as in America, are
beginning to realise this fact.
THE OWNER of the Building sees the fallacy of
building at a great cost extra rooms merely
for beds.
THE HUSBAND sees the fallacy in toiling to buy
furniture, carpets, etc., for a room that is
only used in which to set a bed.
THE HOUSEWIFE sees the fallacy in the
drudgery connected with keeping these rooms
clean, and is able to get out into the fresh
air more and thus save doctor’s bills.

A FEW POINTERS TO PERSONS WHOSE HOUSES ARE OVERCROWDED, and CONTEMPLATE BUILDING, and THOSE REFURNISHING.
COLOSSAL ENTERPRISE.
The enterprise of the Temperance and General
Assurance Co. in launching out in constructing their
extensive series of Residential Flats in Elizabeth
and Park Streets, Sydney, was one requiring con-
siderable thought, and meant embarking upon a new
feature in building construction, so far as Australia
was concerned. It appeared to the heads of the con-
cern, who had seen our Oscillating Wall Beds in
full operation elsewhere, that by installing them
they could economise space and provide additional
accommodation. It is apparent, on the most careful
calculations, that if an ordinary property owner can
nett from 7 to 8 per cent, on his investment, the
T. and G. must nett from 10 to 12 per cent. The
Wall Beds, therefore, more than pay for themselves
within a few months. This great building undertak-
ing has evoked universal admiration amongst archi-
tects, builders and speculators.

A CONCRETE EXAMPLE IN SYDNEY.
The T. & G. Assurance Co.’s Residential Flats, corner of Park and Elizabeth Streets,
Hyde Park, Sydney. Over 100 Wall Beds installed and nearly 3000 sq. feet floor space
saved by using: our patented Beds.
STUDY the ADVANTAGES
One of our Wall Beds installed in a
drawing-room with a Chippendale Cabinet on the
front; in a dining-room, with a sideboard on the
front, or in a living- or sewing-room with a Writing
Desk on the front, will give you the comforts of an
extra bedroom without the extra work or expense.
The criticism of Wall Beds in the past
was that they were not comparable for sleeping com-
fort with stationary beds; that they look unsightly
when let down and unlike a real bed. This is not
true of our Wall Beds. The Oscillating Portal Bed
is a full-sized steel and malleable iron engineering
problem and utility with ball-bearing action that
work to perfection.
Our beds are all one price, but the price
of the woodwork depends upon the finish and design
of the front and the furniture to be attached. We
recommend having the front in keeping with the
walls and furniture of each particular room. Every
installation guaranteed for an unlimited period.
If you are planning a house, see our
bed, and insist on your architect including one or
more, or let your architect leave the recesses—they
only cost about 255.- —they can be used as a word-
robe, and sooner or later you will want them to
ensure your investment safe, and we can always
instal beds later.

IN BANANA LAND
“Rangan”: It took Brisbane 18 months
to make up its mind that ex-German Consul
Hirschfeld was not the very best man in
the city to be Senior Medical Officer of the
General Hospital. I wonder how many
British doctors are on the staffs of German
hospitals, or how many ex-British consuls
have private practices in (say) Berlin?
“Norbell” : Thus the Courier on the war
recitations of a blind soldier who is earning
a crust at a Brisbane show: —
The poems are slightly burdened with the vernacu-
lar of the Australian bush, but otherwise are of a
refreshing character.
Still, we are getting on. For instance, the
Courier has purged its columns of the
German vernacular it favored not long ago,
and now bewails the good old days in Eng-
lish more or less undefiled.
The Government’s Public Works Bill was
lost in the Council. But the Government
promptly made things right by appointing a
Royal Commission of politicians who will
pronounce judgment on all proposed lines,
give unskilled opinioiys on current construc-
tions, and draw fat fees for doing what can
only be done effectively by a committee of
experts.
Premier Ryan was in the middle of con-
gratulating himself that the last ton of
imported weevil and wheat had been chewed
up by the public, when something bit him.
The foreign mixture had been kept up to
£l9 10s. a ton, while N. S. Wales was pay-
ing only £l4 for genuine Australian. But
no sooner had the Government got rid of its
last foreign bushel than it reduced the price
of bread from sd. to 4d. on the ground
that wheat could be bought now at about
£l2 f.o.b. Sydney. Whereupon scandalised
Brisbane master bakers, who hadn’t said a
word while Ryan was working his little
game, talked of base ingratitude and gave
two days’ notice of a strike, or lockout, or
blockade. But Ryan brazened it out; and
after a brief, sharp tussle, the bakers caved
in.
The Board of Control’s luck is right out.
Lately it fixed the price of milk at sd. a
quart. Milkmen talked of going out of the
business, and the Board scuttled back to od.
A few days ago the Board put Rockhampton s
bread down to 4d. The bakers baked no
bread for two days, and the Board climbed
up promptly to 4Ad. Before it does any-
thing more the Board will, it is understood,
say: “Please, gentlemen, may I?” At pre-
sent its principal mission ‘is to excite public
ridicule.
Bananaland’s Northern and Coastal cattle-
men have for years been afflicted with the
cattle-tick, which takes its toll in blood and
hides. So tenacious is the insect that the
cow-owners have long given up all idea
of getting free, and are content to keep the
pest down. Give Strawberry a bath once
a month in a strong solution of arsenic
and you keep her alive, and that’s all you
can do. At least, this is what they will tell
you. But some time back one Munro Hill
came along with an exterminator. He was
despised and rejected, likewise his poison,
and at- each place he visited he was called
a different sort of lunatic. Hill was, how-
ever, sufe of the stuff, and took himself to
the Department’s doorstep. It was the
Department’s busy day. In fact, it was the
Department’s busy week. But the man on
the mat was persistent and very patient, and
after several months managed to get a
select committee appointed to investigate.
This body has now handed in a report to
say that the stuff had done everything that
NO SPORTSMAN.
COCKY (to new hand): “’Ere, git up, I want yer to help out some oats.”
New Hand : “Are they wild?”
COCKY: “No.”
NEW HAND: “'Then wot yer wanter sneak on ’em in the dark for?”
had been asked of it, that the committee
strongly condemns the inaction and lack of
sympathy of the Department, and that the
new exterminator ought to be given a chance
to permanently rid cow of her alien popula-
tion. And so the thing that wasn’t done
before may be done at last.
The tax collected on what is known as
“the guarantee principle” has been wiped
out of the Bananaland railway system. Its
aim was to put part of any loss made on a line
upon the landowners who were supposed to
have benefited by increased land values. It
was a muddled-headed effort to handle a good
theory. If a line pays, it is fairly obvious
that the users are doing well. But under
the guarantee principle the severer the
season the harder the guarantor was hit,
which looked like taking a mean advantage
of poverty and depression. Inconsistencies
like this are much better adjusted by a land
tax, for then the owner of the land knows
what he has to pay, and if he is wise he sets
about meeting the charge by whipping up
his business energy or splitting up His land
and letting other people have a try.
From the Press Gallery :
The man in Queensland who has most surprised
onlookers by his success as a Minister in this present
Labor crowd is Bill H* lilton. With only three or
four others to back him up against a bitterly hostile
majority, and with no previous experience as either
a leader or a Minister, he has emerged from the
fray in the Council with a record highly creditable.
There were times during the session when men for-
tified by experience might easily have lost their
block. Even bitter Tories learned to admire the
man’s courage, determination and patience in the
hot and unsatisfactory battle he had to fight.
There are bargains to be had everywhere
of course, but this will take some beating’
A poundkeeper at Westwood (Rockhamp-
ton district) sold a bay stallion for a shilling
plus commission at 8J per cent. = one penny.
Expenses run to £3 7s. 4d., so there wasn’t
much profit in the deal. And there seems
less sense m a system which makes such a
result possible.
In the Grain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh the heart of the tree has its own sweet
tale; .
If you carve the wood you will find it
there —
Hieroglyphics in sap-red grain
And the alphabet of the sun and rain
And the asterisks of hail.
The gold of pollen, the pearl of dew,
The sulphur dust of a butterfly ;
The rose of ochre, the white of clay—
From deep where the dark roots feel their
way
The type comes throbbing through.
Eternally it is written there.
The tree may die bijt the story stays.
You may shape it into a gambler’s board,
Or some tall chest for a miser’s hoard,
But the woodland runes show fair.
A song perhaps of the curl of ferns ;
A magpie’s lilt or a wonga’s call;
A paragraph of the roots’ moist brown;
A line that the rustling leaves set down,
Or a picture the noon-sun burns !
And, as in the wood the Spring is writ,
Though Time shall hew with a chisel keen,
And Life with its plane my heart lay bare
So that you may read my story there,
You will find your name in the grain of it!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 1, 1916.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Barrister Tom Macleod and six other mem-
bers of the Queensland Volunteer Flying
Corps left for England last week. The
aviating gent, one would have departed
earlier had not the British Government re-
quested him to stand by and train the party.
Altogether nine members of the corps are
on their way to hostile localities, which isn t
a bad record. Miss Macleod is accompany-
ing brother Tom. and will stay with a
medico sister in England until the clouds
roll by.
Dr. Joe Buchanan, who went away with
the A.M.C. as captain, is one of the latest
Queenslanders whose name appears on the
Roll of Honorable Dead. He was for many
weeks in trenches at Gallipoli, and was in-
valided to Egypt, suffering from the soldier’s
sneaking enemy, dysentery. The* saddest
part of the business is that Dr. Joe, who
was universally popular, brought about the
end while in a state of mental strain.
Another meeting of ladies, with Mayoress
Down in the chair, discussed Sandbags and
How to Make Them this week. There seems
to be a desire on the part of some of the
women folk to make the bag fund not a
national one but a sort of pup barking in
the back yard of a local newspaper. The
newspaper has done an immense amount of
good work, but this movement should be as
independent as the Patriotic Fund and under
Government direction.
A Brisbane girl, one of a batch of 70 who
recently went through some weeks’ training
at a Sydney hospital, tells this story. One
of the batch was somewhat unpopular and
at last a bitter old man, who had brought
a full set of whiskers on a visit to the place,
unbosomed himself thus: ,“Wot a helderly
piece like ’er wants in a military ’orspital
dashed if I know. She’ll likely give some
pore cove a turn for the worse.”
More trouble in the Red Cross corner.
I his time it has been caused by three
.totally untrained but enthusiastic girls bid-
ding their friends a fond farewell and an-
nouncing that they were off to work in a
military hospital. This, in face of the
statement of Defence Minister Pearce that
untrained nurses had no chance of military
work, has enraged trained women who,
anxious to get to the war zone, are told that
required at home. I don’t know
whether the girls are merely tarradiddlers or
it there has been more political wire-pulling.
Scotch Australians enthusiastically perpe-
trated Hogmanay yesterday. At Finney’s
a huge dinner, wi’ the haggis and whusky
printed in Scotch, y e ken. and Miss Lily
i aton singing the sangs ma mither sang, was
one of the big events of the day.
Over 1500 customers were serveu in tne
State meat shop on Christmas Eve, which is
something of a record.
Asst. Home Secretary Huxham is visit-
ing the South. While he is away he will
inquire into the care of infant life, and on
his return hopes to be able to lay some sug-
gestions before the Government re the estab-
lishment of a foundling home. A recent
horror, in which a 14-days-old baby and the
river plaved leading parts, has decided
Mr. Huxham that a home of this kind is a
necessary defence for the community against
charges of being accessory to manslaughter.
The races on Monday did not draw a very
big crowd. The Governor came with his aide
(Rowley Morgan, in the absence of Capt.
Cosens)', and Premier Ryan and his pretty
wife were also on the lawn. To-day a much
bigger crowd surged round the tote. Four
times in succession “No. 4” romped home,
but when the superstitious placed their cash
on the same figure for the fifth race. No. 2
landed the prize and cast a sardonic grin
over a well-groomed shoulder at the disap-
pointed ones.
A 15-year-old Queensland girl created a
mild sensation at Bundaberg the other day.
W. Draper could not find a jockey for his
horse Mown Hay, so his young daughter
rode the animal twice, and was first home
in one race.
Captain Desailly, about to leave Brisbane
for Egypt as a member of the A.A.M.C., is
identical with the Dr. Desailly who for long
ministered to the aching bones of Victorian
Camperdown, where the blessings of sheep-
ishness form the main topic at morning-gin
and afternoon-whisky. The voyageur would
have been in the neighborhood of the high
explosives long since but for having to tidy
up his affairs and arrange for the feeding
of the chooks in his absence.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The Queensland Home Department has
some peculiar difficulties with its nigger
dependents. An aboriginal superstition for-
bids people to go on living in a hut where
a person has died, and therefore the Home
authorities had for some time to keep on
pulling down old huts and erecting new ones.
The difficulty was finally overcome by build-
ing a so-called “dying house,” where the
moribund could pass away without compel-
ling the State to pull down and rebuild any-
thing.
“Cleveland”: Commonwealth Director of
Navigation Davies, ivho visited Banana land
recently, was nearly responsible for several
deaths from heart failure among his branch
of the Civil Service. The Navigation Bill
proposes that harbor masters, shipping in-
spectors, engineer surveyors and pilots shall
be graded and receive pay accordingly. This,
even in most of the Southern States, will
mean a rise, but in Bananaland, whose
marine officials have been paid any old thing,
the increase will be in the vicinity of 50 per
cent, in some cases. Consequently, when
Davies allowed some of the prospective recipi-
ents a glimpse of what is threatened them,
the weaker vessels broke down and asked
how they were to pay income tax on such
salaries !
“Barcoo”: The “heart leaf” gets its fine
work in on stock quicker and with more
deadly effect than any other Doison plant in
Australia. This particular bush grows in
the most desert-like portion of the forest
that lies between the Peak and the Western
Downs of Central Queensland, and is just
as sudden dead or alive. Quite recently
Baarmutha, near Longreach, had 4000 sheep
going to Green Tree, on the Clermont to
Aramac-road. The drovers lost their lati-
tude and the jumbucks wandered into some
of the bush before the man in charge could
retrieve them. Half the mob perished in
great agony within 12 hours. The strangest
part of the happening was that one of the
drovers’ dogs, sniffing round a just-
dead animal, licked some of the usual
frothing at the mouth, and five minutes
afterwards apparently went mad. It had
a sort of fit, rushed off into an adjacent
scrub and has not been seen since.
Anthony St. Ledger, once a Queensland
Senator, still bobs up serenely now and
again in Melbourne, with a finger pointing
towards the star of Empire. The other
evening one of his bobs occurred at the
Austral Salon, when he read a “paper” on
‘Some Imperial Aspects of the War.”
Nowadays not many opportunities come to
Sledger of showing his party that he is still
alive —waiting and willing to carry the
banner of Liberalism into Parliament. But
when the call comes, if it ever does come
again, Sledger will be there, a trifle weary
of manner, maybe, and with his stock of
Liberal sentiments somewhat frayed around
the edges and crumbly down the middle ; but
full of polite, eager desire to give the
Empiah a lift. The reading of “papers” at
places like the Austral Salon is an adver-
tisement (usually cut down to two lines by
the contemptible dailies) of his being still
willin’.

Does it not ensure Studebaker quality ?
Does it not mean that you are safe in the purchase of a Studebaker ?
Britain recognised -STUDEBAKER superiority back in the Boer War, and during the present great conflict
she has already purchased more than £4,000,000 s worth of Studebaker material.
To this we must add Studebaker’s enviable Australian reputation —built up during the past three seasons.
Last month a Studebaker “SIX’ 1 established the greatest motoring feat ever recorded; that of travelling
from Fremantle to Sydney (3289 miles) in 8 days 23 hours 35 minutes.

How to Discard an
Unsightly Complexion.
"Toilet 'Club Notes.”
How many women exclaim as they behold
their ugly complexion in the mirror, “It 1
could only tear off this old skin!” and, do
you know, it is now possible to do that very
thing? Not to actually remove the entire
skin all of a sudden; that would be too
heroic a method and painful, too, I imagine.
The worn-out cuticle comes off in such tiny
particles, and so gradually—requiring about
ten days to complete the transformation—it
doesn’t hurt a bit. Day by day the beautiful
complexion underneath comes forth. Mar-
vellous! No matter how muddy, rough,
blotchy or aged your complexion, you can
surelv discard it by this simple process.
Just get some ordinary mercolised wax at
your chemist’s, apply nightly like cold cream,
washing it off in the mornings.
Why Have Grey Hair?
When a simple, old-fashioned and harmless recipe
will correct it.
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
an ounce of concentrate of tammalite and mix
it with four ounces of bay rum. Apply this
simple lotion to the hair for a few nights with
a small sponge, and you will soon have the
pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy, and has- given perfect
satisfaction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
A Strange Shampoo.
"Cosy Corner Chats.”
* * * I was much interested to learn from
this young woman with the beautiful glossy
hair that she never washes it with soap or
artificial shampoo powders. Instead she
makes her own shampoo by dissolving a
teaspoonful of stallax granules in a cup of
hot water. “I make my chemist get the
stallax for me,” said she. “It comes only in
Jib. sealed packages, enough to make up
twenty-five or thirty individual shampoos,
and it smells so good I could almost eat it.”
Certainly this little lady’s hair did look won-
derful even if she has strange ideas of a
shampoo. I am tempted to try the plan
myself.
Blackheads Instantly Go.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment gives instant
relief.
A very simple, harmless and pleasant pro-
cess is how used to remove blackheads and
correct greasiuess and large pores in the skin.
You have only to drop a tablet of stymol,
obtained from the chemist’s, into a glass of
hot water and bathe the face wdth the liquid
after the effervescence has subsided. The
blackheads will then come right oft' on the
towel. The enlarged pores immediately con-
tract to normal and the greasiuess disap-
pears. leaving the skin smooth, soft and cool
and free from blemish. But to make sure
that this desirable result is permanent, it is
advisable to repeat the treatment several
times at intervals of say about four or five
days.
Is Powder Necessary ?
“Practical Suggestions.”
I say emphatically, No! There is a simple
lotion which can be easily and cheaply made
at home, and it is at the same time both
effective and beneficial to the complexion.
Clemiuite is a splendid substitute for face
powder, which is at the bottom of many
complexion troubles. Get about an ounce
from the chemist’s and dissolve in four table-
spoonsful of water. The result is a fine clear
liquid, which instantly gives the face, neck or
arms that peach-like bloom of perfect health.
There is nothing to equal it for greasy skins,
and the result lasts all day long under the
most trying conditions. [4

The Melbourne I’.L.C. has silenced Tory
innuendoes by ruling that all branches which
approve of Trades Hall opposition to the
Federal Labor Government’s recruiting
scheme shall be officially branded “disloyal.
Fat Man couldn’t ask more than that of a
Political Labor Council.
“Caesar”: It was in Gallipoli. A splinter
from a bomb nearly severed a finger. It
left the digit hanging by the skin. So the
Maorilander made his way to the nearest
dressing station. “Look here, Doc.,” he
said. The doctor looked, seized- a knife, and
the finger was gone for ever. “Strike me!”
said Bill, “if I’d ha’ known that that was
the best you could do for it, I wouldn’t have
carried the blessed thing so far.”
The oldest engine toiling for the Victorian
railways was 54 years old last birthday.
Tom Woodroffe. w T ho was till lately chief
mechanical engineer of the department,
worked in the Williamstown workshops when
this class of engine was being used to pull
the “expresses” of those days, and he gives it
a good name as a fast and easy traveller.
Then, of course, the “express” only had to
carry a few dozen passengers and their hand-
bags. Nowadays the 54-year old does a little
light shunting for its living and rests a good
deal between jobs. The newest Victorian A 2
is a giant. It is mostly a Woodroffe design,
and one of them is turned out at Newport
every week.
“W’lang” There were fire brigades in Mel-
bourne long before Sam Mauger’s day (B.
16/12/T5). Antecedent to the Fire Brigade
Boards every suburb had at'least one- corps
and very often two or three; and the Carlton
Brewery and various other private concerns
ran their own squads. Sandridge had a bri-
gade of boys all under 18. Among the old-
time captains of the metropolis were H. de C.
Keliett (now a baronet), Jack Kelly (since
dead), G. Munro, and “Cocky” Delves (at
present a councillor of Fitzroy). Time was
when the Kew Brigade consisted of Keliett
and seven others-—just sufficient to make up
a competition team, and they took some
beating. Jack Ballenger (now a colonel)
had charge of the Carlton Brewery Brigade,
which amassed a silversmith’s shop collection
of trophies. Some people thought Ballenger
should have got the job the imported Stein
achieved. But the insurance cos. were
mostly of the irqported brand too.
George Georgeson, appointed registrar and
executive officer of the Sydney Metal Ex-
change through which Prime Minister Hughes
hopes to wrest the ore-handling business from
the Germans, will at any rate give the experi-
ment a fair chance. Georgeson is a Scotch-
man who was saturated in oil before he cafne
to Australia to put the Commonwealth Oil
Corporation’s products on the market. It
was while lobbying to get protection for this
business that he came into contact with
Hughes and Pearce and other politicians, and
when Hughes wanted a man to push his
Metal Exchange idea along he remembered
Georgeson’s persuasiveness and laid hold of
the affable, hard-headed Scotstralian.
A. W. Stuckey, of Levin (M.L.), who
was a machine gunner in the round-up of the
German forces in German West Africa to-
wards the beginning of the year, talks about
the well-poisoning that was mentioned in
the cables :
If you were being chased to your death by a
vastly superior and better armed force, wouldn’t
you poison the water-supply to check the enemv and
ward off the punch ? Sure you would ! Anyhow,
the poisoning was not done by putting in some
subtle, invisible poison that would kill off its drink-
ers like flies. It was only done to deprive us of
water —a fair thing in war. As a matter of fact,
you could smell a well a quarter of a mile away, and
you only had to look at the stuff to see that it had
been doctored, for it was invariably milky-white in
color. I think the Germans simply emptied sheep-dip
into each well as they retreated, for it had a strong
carbolic smell. It certainly gave us a lot of trouble,
but that was all in the game.
Stuckey adds that the wells of “German
West” are usually about 14ft. in diameter
and about 40ft. in depth, cut through hard
shale, which was sufficient reason for not
trying to make new ones. Instead the in-
vaders emptied the old ones, allowed them to
fill again and baled them out some more. The
third water, though a little tainted, was
good enough to drink. The most powerful
factor in the big round-up were the 25 semi-
armored machine-gun motor-cars, which
travelled over 700 miles of little-known and
roadless bushveldt country, and finished up
by taking the fort —one built in the old
feudal style with walls Bft. thick—at Numu-
tone, on Lake Etosha. There they found
arms and ammunition for between 50.000
and 60,000 men, waiting to be distributed to
the hoped-for traitor forces of S’Africa.
“Bill o’ Costs,” from the table:—
My learned cobbers are nothing if not united,
though the set terms of politeness come oddly at
times. Recently in a southern State two K.C’s. let
themselves go in an undignified newspaper wrangle
about nothing in particular. The correspondence
degenerated rapidly, through much insult and offen-
Siveness, to personal innuendoes, and ended in
. epistolary fury, loathing and contempt. The next
time they met in court each blandly referred to the
other as “my learned friend.” Observe, too, that the
High Court Judges call one another “brother.” Good
old English custom, of course, but smacking to
Australian ears of the Methodist Conference. The
brotherly feeling between two, at least, of the most
distinguished of the brethren is at times grimly
humorous. One of them, with a remarkable capacity
for differing from the other, usually prefaces his
dissent with an expression of “the very greatest
deference, or “with the utmost respect for the
opposite opinion,” and then proceeds, with a pro-
nounced “don’t-care-a-damn-for-what-yo-u-think,” to
tear his highly-respected brother's opinion to rags.
•A sample: “Facility for the correction of injustice
is one of the reasons for our existence as a court;
but that view is obviously not accepted as sufficient
by my brethren.” The other every now and then
counters heavily by putting in a last spoke. For
instance: '“As my brother has thought fit to
refer to Smith’s case, I wish to say that in my
opinion it has nothing whatever to do with this
case.” And again: “In order that the opinion ex-
pressed by my brother may not be taken as
that of the Bench, I desire to add,” etc. This
method is slightly rough on brother , because
by the time he has thought of something polite to
fire back his elder brother has adjourned the court.

A Woman's Health,
Every woman’s health is peculiarly depen-
dent upon the condition of her blood. How
many women suffer with headache, pain in
the back, poor appetite, weak digestion, a
constant feeling _of weariness, palpitation
of the heart, shortness of breath, pallor and
nervousness? If you have any of these
symptoms do not despair of getting better,
but begin now, to-day, to build up your
blood with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. See
how the nervous energy of the body is
restored as the blood becomes pure and red
and the entire system is strengthened to
meet every demand upon it.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are useful for
all women, but they are particularly valu-
able to girls of school age who show symp-
toms of going into a decline, who become
pale, nervous and languid. Those pills aid
in securing perfect development and health
by strengthening the system and purifying
and building up the blood. Thin blood dur-
ing the growing years of a girl’s life usu-
ally means a flat-chested and hollow-cheeked
womanhood. There can be neither health
nor beauty without red blood, which gives
brightness to the eyes and color to cheeks
and lips.
You can get Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
from your nearest dealer; or they can be
had direct'from the Dr. .Williams’ Medicine
Go., Sydney.— Advt.
To Correct Constipation.
Constipation is usually accompanied by
indigestion, either as the cause or as a
result. In correcting constipation it is very
important to restore the stomach, intestines
and other digestive organs to a healthful
condition.
It is here that Pinkettes, the new laxa-
tive, have an exceptional value. One of
these, little pink granules taken after the
principal meal each day will promote diges-
tion and stimulate the appetite. Pinkettes
clear away waste material, prevent conges-
tion, and with a little persistence really
correct constipation.
.Write to-day to the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Co., Sydney, mentioning The
Dulletin, for a free sample of Pinkettes,
or get a full-sized Is. bottle from your
chemist.— Advt.

Howard Lloyd, who won a vacant seat
among the Bank of Adelaide directors after
the hardest tight over a job of this kind S.
Aus. has ever known, is a son of J. S. Lloyd*,
who died at North Adelaide last year. The
father belonged to the family which founded
Lloyd’s Bank, one of the biggest of English
concerns. The agile and brainy son married
a grand-daughter of Henry Ayers, who got
a tag to his name for being in command in
S. Aus. when the Overland Telegraph was
completed and it had been forgotten that
the old man had opposed the whole business.
Every day Australia is turning out the
stuff that makes Gallipoli heroes. In N. S.
Wales, within a couple of weeks, there were
the cases of the youngster (aged eight) who,
after killing a snake which had bitten his small
brother, administered first aid, and carried
the youngster nearly two miles in search of
assistance; of the boy of 11 who rescued his
mother from an angry bull by attacking the
raging beast in front and flank ; and of the
Wagga 14-year-old who fought with the
current and the drowning boy himself to
save a mate from the Murrumbidgge. Good
wholesome Australian life produce’s the phy-
sique that can endure. But it does, more:
it gives the grit without which thejihysique
doesn’t count.
“The Old Soldier” explains,:—
The supposed impossible has been accomplished in
the evacuation of the positions at Anzae and Suvla
Bay by an army in actual contact with a strong and
vigilant enemy, t All the text-books say that such a
thing is quite out of the question, and in all the
wars that have been fought it has never been done
before. AVhen Moore’s army finished its retreat
through Spain in 1809 at Corunna with Soult at
its heels, though it had a fleet of transports waiting
and a strongly-fortified town to cover the embarka-
tion, it had to fight a desperate battle, in which
Moore was killed, before it could get away. So
invariably has such been the experience of armies
in oversea expeditions that it has come to be re-
garded as an axiom that no army which has once
been landed in a foreign country would ever attempt
to re-embark till it had beaten to a standstill the
enemy opposed to it. The, change is easily accounted
for, though not entirely, by the fact that the range
of projectiles is so great now that a defending army
cannot keep its enemy under effective observation.
That seems to have. been the Turks’ difficulty at
Anzac, and henceforward it always will be a difficulty.
•T. .T. Miller’s handy little date-book for
1916, with tables of town populations, etc.,
is another reminder of the absurdly patchy
settlement of Australia at large and Victoria
in particular. Only eight towns in Victoria
have 5000 inhabitants or more, whereas
Queensland with less than half the popula-
tion has 14. Every State in the Common-
wealth shows a wider distribution of its !
masses than Vic., though none compare with
Maoriland, where the biggest city—Auckland
—holds only one-ninth of the total, exclusive 1
of Maoris.

Greatly. Awful Itching Prevented
Sleeping. Cuticura Ointment
Healed. Hair Now Thick.
Fernleigh, Turil, N. S. W.—“ For two
years I suffered with dandruff in my head
which caused my hair to fall out greatly
and was very annoying as it used to show
on my dress. The trouble looked like a rash
and I was continually troubled with an
awful itching which prevented me from
sleeping.
“I then tried Cuticura. I applied the
Cuticura Ointment daily and when soaked
in the scalp I removed it by washing with
hot water and Cuticura Soap. By the time
I had used the contents of the tin of Cuti-
cura Ointment I was completely cured and
my hair has now grown quite thick again.”

BOOTS have come back again and no mistake.
But such dreams of boots, up-to-date,
dainty, delightful, fit accompaniment to the
flounced taffeta frocks of the day, which
combine smart modernity with old-world charm.
Paris and London both are now tripping to work
and play in short-fronted, high-heeled, suede-
topped boots like the Bostock style here illus-
trated.
It is a smart little boot, there is no doubt
about that, and every bit as comfortable as it is
smart. The beautifully fitting- last on which it is
made sees to that, and lots of women, who have
never imagined they could wear a short-fronted
style, will be amazed to find how comfortable it
is, how jolly it makes their feet look.
Then for those who want something different,
who prefer shoes perhaps, there is a fine range of
styles to select from, all as up-to-date and charm-
ing as this model, and all safe to wear well and
feel as peculiarly one’s own as if they had been
made to measure.

“Cscsar’s Ghost”: Maoriland pressmen are
butting into the fray to some purpose. Up
till lately 109 men engaged on the literary
side of the Dominion newspapers had
enlisted. Seven of them had been killed in
action —F. A. Cimino (Wellington Fost),
S. B. Monteith (Dannevirke News), 11. J.
Daniel (Wellington Dominion), C. G.
Yorke (Lyttelton Times), Albert Harding
(Taranaki News), A. Wagstaff (Timaru
Herald), J. R. Dunn (Wairarapa Times) ;
F. L. Vickers (Hastings Tribune) is
missing and is believed to be dead; and
Leslie P. Sole (New Plymouth Herald) has
died of wounds. From the Auckland Herald
alone 14 pressman-soldiers dashed off to get
the latest particulars, and five of them came
into collision with bullets. Even the women
have made their contribution: Miss Brandon,
who described the local skirt and sensational
tea-party for the Wellington Times, is now
binding up wounds somewhere.

The dear old S. M. Herald again
(20/12/T5) :
Both the papers and notices of motion should be
in the hands of the secretary, Mr. H. A. College,
Egg-laying Competition, care Department of Agri-
culture, Sydney, by April Ist next.
With a desire to avoid showing vulgar
familiarity with this man College, the old
lady put in “Mister,” but the gentleman is
much better known as plain Hawkesbury
Agricultural.

“F.N.T.”: A consistent Victorian per-
former among the minor-poetesses is Marion
Miller (Mrs. Knowles), who has been turn-
ing out mother’s-knee and quivering gumleaf
verse for some 20 years, with every sign of
appreciation from the right quarter. She
now has several volumes to her credit; and
her lullabies and children’s rhymes are em-
ployed instead of soothing syrup in many nur-
series. The Miller family occupies Saint Fillan,
which used to be the late Premier Jimmy
Munro’s dwelling, at Narbethong—over in
the forest country at the back of the Black
Spur. Nowadays Mrs. Knowles lives at
Malvern. She has a hobby, of course. It is
keeping an honorary business eye on the
Broadmeadows Foundling Hospital and St.
Joseph’s home for orphans and neglected
children —more power to her!
* * * *
The reporter wrote “Ten coffins were then
placed in the mortuary van.” But the lino,
expert knew better. He made it “tea and
coffee.”
* * * *
The big Oxford Dictionary, now working
along towards the end of the alphabet,
claims to have settled the age and the origin
of “suffragette.” The over-used word will be
only 10 years old in January. It first ap-
peared in London Daily Mail, and was
invented by Charles Hands, a journalist
sending a despatch from Manchester.
* * * *
“EtJ Ego” : As one who has struggled for
years to make meat out of metre I can only
envy Alfred Pearce Butler, who swore in
the Flemington Court on 21/12/’l5 that he
could make 16s. a day by writing and sell-
ing anthems. This should turn “Bellerive”
"reen and arouse the admiration of Mel-
bourne’s penny balladist, James Purtell, who
recently told the Herald that he supported
himself entirely by his verse. Butler,
after having lived happily with his wife tor
17 years, was sued for maintenance, anci
the Court made an order for 255. a week
with costs. Little Sonenburg, the solicitor
for the plaintiff, said that Butler was a
sawdust merchant by occupation, and a
poet by inclination. Evidently his song is
that of the circular saw-- ‘I m sawdust
when I sing.” “If my wife comes back,
said he, “I will give her a home equal to
any in the land.” “You never know where
he will break out since he _ has taken to
poetry,” was counsel's cynical comment.
Then the Bench made the order, and the
maker of anthems and sawdust left to write
an ode about it.
• * *
“Nibbidard” : The manner in which these
Yank spell-binders disembowel the classical
dictionaries and grope for the metaphors of
antiquity is some surprising, considering
what an effective weapon is at their disposal
in the slang phrases of their own great
nation. Theodore Roosevelt, according to
the cable, has just called Withdraw Wilson,
apropos of his speech to Congress, a Bjzan-
tiue logothete.” Nothing so luscious as this
has appeared in print sj nce the fe. j •
Herald closed a fine old crusted leader with
the remark, “But let us not forget th , e f^ e
of the Bitliynian youth.” llirougli the
weary years of inky-wayfaring that have
followed his reading of that cryptic caution,
the present writer lias often paused to won-
der who the youth was, and wliat befeljnm.
Possibly lie was .fired by “Mister James tor
having failed to dot the “i” in “cuneiform.
A CRITICAL PHRASE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Miss Fidget’s muse we all must praise;
There’s merit in these modest lays”—
So scrawled the critic in his den.
His most appreciative pen
“Viewed her achievements with amaze.”
lie passed her figurative bays,
Adding: “In these degenerate days
It charms us all to hear again
Miss Fidget’s muse.”
But sometimes sportive Fate essays
To liven up in little ways
The lives of literary men.
She smudged the critic’s screed, and then
A careful comp, set up the phrase,
“Miss Fidget’s mews”!

ith a view to making it
grow and become more
beautiful —the soil in
which the plant grows
must be attended to.
Therefore the scalp,
in which the hair
grows must receive
the attention if you
are to expect it to
grow and become more
beautiful. Loss of
hair is caused by the
scalp drying up, or
losing its supply of
moisture or nutriment;
when baldness occurs
the scalp has simply
lost all its nourish-
ment, leaving nothing
for the hair to feed
upon. (A plant, or
even a tree, would die
under similar condi-
tions.) The natural
thing to do in either
case is to feed or
replenish the soil or
scalp as the case may
be, and your crop

beautiful hair with Mr. Burleigh’s TRUE
HAIR GROWER, and how surprisingly
one’s whole appearance, one’s brightness and
personal charms are improved by slight
attention to the hair.
Hair troubles, like many other diseases, have
been wrongly diagnosed and altogether mis-
understood. The hair itself is not the thing to
be treated, for the reason that it is simply a
tended it should. Mr. Burleigh’s TRUE
HAIR GROWER, we understand, has a
most wonderful effect upon the hair glands
and tissues of the scalp. It is the only remedy
for the hair ever discovered that is similar
to the natural foods or liquids of the
scalp. It penetrates the pores quickly,
and the hair soon shows the effects
of its wonderful, exhilarating and life-
producing qualities.

Workers All Use REXONA
Round the Tram Sheds, the Work Shops, on the Wharves, and at the
Factories, you will hear all the boys say: “Rexona is the best Remedy in
the whole country. W T e always use it.”
All these healthy lads know what they are talking about. They live a
strenuous life, and always wish to be in fit condition; but bruises,
abrasions, cuts and hurts are bound to come their way, in the natural
course of events, and it is when these occur that they prove the worth
of Rexona, the Rapid Healer.
REXONA Everyone’s Friend
There are so many uses for Rexona that everyone is using it now. One day it
may be found useful for the minor hurts which are forever occurring in everyday
life, and another day it will prove invaluable for the more serious troubles, such
as Piles, Eczema and various forms of Skin Disorders. People in every class of life
use Rexona, from the highest to the lowest, and Rexona brings relief to all; so
get a 1/6 pot of Rexona to-day, and you will soon find it so useful that it will not
be long before you are getting the larger pots holding nearly four times the
quantity, for 3/-.

All Grey.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL grey!
Outside grey rain over wind-swept
moors.
Lavender close to the grey old doors
Where the iron knockers are worn away
Into the woodwork and lichened grey ;
And up in the tower a winding stair
Is hung with spider-webs everywhere,
And it leads to a turret far away,
Showing but sky, and that sky all grey.
Someone w’ent up that stair to-day,
And her small round ankle was clad in grey—
Grey like a spider web, soft and silk,
With rosy tinting on skin of milk,
And grey to her kerchief went the gown
Where the muslin ruffles were gathered down
Over a bosom plump and white
Where a single jewel flashed —out of sight.
The hair was golden beneath the cap
And the high black heels of her shoes went
tap,
Tap in a hurry on the stair.
I wonder if someone waited there
Up on the turret close to the sky,
Where the pale grey rain went sweeping by?
All grey! _
Grey-leafed whin on the wet grey moor,
Big grey spider behind the door;
Lavender in the garden place,
A grey sun dial with hoary face;
Ashen spikes by the sill a-sway
Sweetly scented, but only grey ;
Leaden lichen on broken walls—
But Someone listens if Someone calls.
Grey silk stockings, and dove grey gown,
And a cheek like a robin cuddled down.
Two came from the turret’s arch to-day.
She walked before him a little w’ay,
Nor through brown lashes gave one blue
look,
While his eyes were glued to a learned book.
And the great boughs sighed in the cold grey
wind,
But she turned her heVer, iior looked behind,
Her cap set straight on her small bright
head —
Did the turret wind make her mouth so red,
Mouth set in lines of forgotten laughter?
She was deaf to the steps that followed after.
Her eyes and his thoughts seemed far away !
A long-shanked Puritan all in grey,
With sallow features and close black hair.
And lips that muttered a ranter’s prayer,
With woollen stockings and Quaker hat
Dull silver buckle... .But look at that!
Round the button looping his grey cloak’s
fold
Is a long, bright hair that is warm —and
gold !

Guardian Angeis.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Old Boy and the Young Chap
strolled from the dining-room into a
pleasant, star-roofed place of palms,
and marble tables, and reflected lights, and
the blue atmosphere of deep, laughing voices
remote from treble discord. Somewhere a
band played. They settled down in a well-
padded corner and lit their cigars.
"How little women understand men!” said
the Old Boy, after a long silence.
“The big ones are just as cunning !” the
Young Chap laughed morosely. Bella had
bowled him clean out last week, and, after
d frightful scene, had hurled the engagement
ring at his feet, He had grown to love
Bella —what wonder that he should now
seek to satisfy the cravings of an acquired
taste by going to the Devil!
“How little women —little and big—under-
stand men,” repeated the other with un-
ruffled serenity. For a moment his smooth
kindly face was the face of a singing cherub,
as he blew himself a halo.
“They’re all fools !”
“Yes —and no. \Ve men realise with
infinite pity what a fool a woman is to be
a woman; yet, if she were not a woman,
what a fool she would be !”
“I wonder if they grasp that fact —as
clearly as you put it.”
“No—no ; I think we may safely say ‘No.’
Not in any sense reflecting on their intelli-
gence, but because they have always some
pressing engagement”
“Which they regard as a ‘scrap of paper’ !”
“Yes—or even terminate by telephone.
Just ‘Ring off, Charlie.’ The ‘Central’ of their
heart—let us put it that way —is for ever
listening with both ears for rings from the —
the Manly Exchange.” He laughed so de-
lightedly that an accidental little ring leapt
heavenward from his lips.
“And now, my dear boy”—he lowered his
voice—“let me tell you a good story.”
The Young Chap stared in surprise.
“Yes —a red-hot story. One of the best
that is, the worst.”
“That’s not like you !”
“No, it’s not like the old friend who taught
you to swim, and introduced you to Bella ;
but, then, are you? However, this is
no time for moralising, so just sit back and
listen. It’s a paralyser.”
The Young Chap glanced at his watch.
“It seems but as yesterday,” began the
Old Boy, lying back comfortably, and
addressing the blurred stars, “that I, too,
had an urgent appointment” —-again the
watch clicked —“an urgent appointment at
7.30 sharp. Correct me if I am wrong, but
I gather from your exceedingly bad manners
that your appointment to-night is also
sharp!”
“I can spare 15 minutes.”
"Then we have ample time without en-
croaching upon the eternity you will be kept
waiting. So I shall tell you everything l
can recollect—everything —of my strange
nocturnal adventure, without the slightest
delicacy or regard for those honorable reti-
cences which”
The Young Chap sat forward, staring as
well he might. , _
“But you don’t mean to say that you le
going to give a woman away?”
The Old Boy bounced forward. Hot ash
showered on his knees. He blew a thunder-
cloud. His cigar blazed.
oU young ll e lay back again with
a queer laugh. “Waiter! two cherry bran-
mes you’ll have one? You’re not yourself,
laa, or you would never have said that. And
while the drinks are coming”—he looked
very straight at- the other —“I shall begin
a- ®tory, exactly as promised.”
..ti * olin B Chap still stared.
“How strangely life repeats itself! I
vividly recall, on such a night as this, a
long-demolished fish-shop. Upstairs, ladies’
room. Within that hall of dazzling light
four distinct impressions remain. I remem-
ber, one, the crimson-and-gold wall-paper;
two. hanging up a little velvet cloak (1
loathe touching velvet) ; three, the young
Greek waiter with his gleaming smile. 1
remember him chiefly because of, four, his
thumb in the soup, but perhaps also for the
glowing thoughts he stirred —thoughts that
harmonised with the voluptuous wallpaper
and my gorgeous anticipations; thoughts of
immortal Helen of Avoirdupois—Troy, I
mean ; really, Norman Lindsay has a lot to
answer for. By-the-way, what fish did we
have for dinner to-night?”
“Fish?” repeated the other, dazed by the
sudden digression. “Fillet of whiting,
wasn’t it?”
The Old Boy chuckled. “Fillet of whit-
ing was ‘off.’ I spoke severely to the waiter
about it. We had grilled bream. At least
I had; you left yours untouched.”
“When’s the story going to begin?”
“Which only shows with what fidelity life
repeats itself”
“That’s no reason why you should”
“repeats itself, because I also forget <
every detail of that romantic dinner, except
the thumb. You follow the plot so far? Red
wall-paper—velvet cloak—handsome young
Greek —thumb-soup”
“And Helen, of course, also handsome?”
“There was, as you shrewdly hint, also a
hansom. Would to Heaven that I could
forget it! A ricketty contraption that
rattled through the ill-lit purlieus of the
city, by an alarming series of bounds. At
first I thought the driver was lashing the
horse, but soon realised there was some
more dreadful reason for its kangaroo
action” ——
“Do yott call this a love-story?”
“Peering through a tear in the leather
apron at the brute”-
“The nightmare!”
“I saw, to my horror, that, owing to
short traces, constant friction had worn its
tail to a ghastly red stump. My God 1 it was
horrible! Ah ! here are the drinks —just in
time !”
“How did the girl take it?”
“As I have already told you, the poor
brute must have suffered agony. Had I
remembered its sex I should have mentioned
the fact. Fortunately, a moment later the
driver pulled up in a dismal street, opposite
a house —you know the sort of house?”
“Yes, yes. Get on —I mean get out.”
“In some outlandish locality called —Chip-
pendale I fancy was the name of the
wretched hamlet”
“Now for the blooming Ghost!”
“I next remember standing in a dim and
stuffy passage, whispering to a poisonous
green dressing-gown. Whatever was in it
has vanished utterly. The garment doubted
that I really was Aubrey Fortescue till I
proved it with a sovereign.”
“You really remember the sovereign? Cash
is such a petty detail at such times. Con-
fess, now, that the sovereign slipped in as
an artistic touch !”
“My salary at that time was three-ten a
week —I remember the sovereign. And
believe me, once again, that the artist who
strives truly to paint the tragic face of Life
has no time for ‘artistic touches,’ and if,
in these semi-obliterated memories, you fail
to recognise an Old Master, watch closely,
and you will assuredly see”
“An old mistress! Really some of your
puns are horribly obvious; their advancing
footfall sounds like a policeman coming to
arrest my attention.”
“Your ear is keener than mine—for a
policeman’s step. I was going to say you
will see something you will not forget.” He
paused impressively.
“A tragedy queen? I loathe tragedy.
The Old Boy sat silent for a moment, a
faint smile on his face. His impulsive
friend was such a boy —only twenty-five
years old !
“The next thing I remember is a
room” . ~
“Lights 10-w, and passionate violins!
“A room”
“What kind of room?”
“A fairly large one”
“Was the grand piano brass-mounted t
“I am wrong in saying I remember the
room. All I really remember is the exact
position of two pictures in relation to the
door.” .
“Took her to a damned picture gallery!
The flippancy was forced. He was conscious
of a relentless purpose beneath the light
manner and easy phrases of his friend, who
now sat forward to the table and took some
wooden matches from the stand.
“Here was the door” —he placed a match
—“and here” —another match —“was the
little boy toppling over the precipice, and
here” — a third match—“the guileless maiden
midway on the breaking plank that spanned
the bottomless chasm.” He pointed at the
three matches. “There you see the room
exactly as my memory now stands in it a
phantom room, consisting solely of a door
and mural decorations floating in space.’
“Rather draughty, wasn’t it?”
“The pictures were German oleographs.
It may be that motives of delicacy prompted
me to study them longer than I might other-
wise have done; of that I have no recollec-
tion. Anyhow, they remain for ever in my
memory, stored there amidst a jumble of
curious relics from the buried Pompeii of
passionate youth. Cunningly designed to
satisfy the artistic and spiritual aspirations
of the English public, they yet remained
essentially German, in conception and in
treatment. The fat masses of ruthless color
assaulted the eye just as though it were a
Belgian woman, while the Guardian Angel
—have you ever by any chance seen a Ger-
man Guardian Angel?”
“I shall to-night!”
“Then I hope you’ve got your revolver.
I have mentioned the two pictures, the boy

IF IT WERE BETTER KNOWN
that Backache, Dropsy, Rheumatism, Sediment, Dizziness and a Constant Sleepy Feeling
point to Kidney Disease, there would be fewer fatal cases than there are.
Thousands have kidney trouble and don’t
know it, because it comes on so quietly. To
all appearances the patient may be in good
health except for an occasional backache
and a heavy, drowsy feeling. But before
the disease is much further advanced there
are sharp, shooting pains in the loins and
back; the water is cloudy and gravelly; the
patient may have to keep getting up in the
night to relieve the bladder, or there may be
distress in seeking relief, and partial stop-
page; then the limbs begin to swell with
water (dropsy), the heart seems affected,
the hands and feet are chilly; there may be
rheumatism or lumbago.
The only hope of successful treatment is
to commence before the kidneys become
seriously involved. A thorough course of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills should be.
taken to relieve inflammation and conges-
tion of the kidneys, and to restore the natural
action of the kidneys and bladder. This
medicine acts quickly and directly upon the
kidneys, promoting a free flow, by which the
poisonous impurities are flushed out of the
system.

TWO LASTINC SYDNEY CURES.
I PARRAMATTA. |
Mr. R Spring, White Hart Hotel, Church Street,
airamatta, says:—“l make the following state-
ment so that other sufferers may know that there is
an unfailing cure for backache in Doan’s Backache
Kidney I ills. Off and on for many years I suffered
lom a bad back ; pains would catch me across the
loins, and I could not stand up straight. I was
frequently laid up for days at a time. 1 consulted
doctors, but their treatment was ineffectual. I
used dozens of remedies, but it was only waste of
time and money. At last I was advised by a
tnend to try Doan’s Backache Kidney Bills, so got
some at once, and 1 am pleased to say this wonder-
u remedy cured me and I feel a different man.
ft is grand to be free of backache, and I am grate-
-11 t..° . Goan s Backache Kidney Pills for my cure.”
Bight years later Mr. Spring says:—“The above
statement is true, every word, and I can now add
nL 1 > mi ri r i nt t. a r- that 1 am still well to-day.
Boan s Backache Kidney Pills deserve praise. They
cured me after other remedies had failed to even
give me relief.”

stumbling over the brink of the precipice
and the girl on the breaking plank Avith an
ostentatiously shattered handrail. The
same fiendish Guardian Angel was luring
each to destruction—an exuberant-bosomed
harpy in a low-necked nightdress. The
glazed smile with Avhich she awaited the
catastrophe Avas hellish. Her gross person
and flat wings hinted neither womanly pity
nor angelic grace. She Avas the Guardian
Angel of Prussian infancy, a cross between
a Taube Avarplane and a prolific sow. My
dear hoy, why is it that Avhenever my
speech touches Germany it smells of the
pigsty ?”
“Try a lighter touch.”
“I Avill. To put it more decently, that
Guardian Angel Avas Avhat we must imagine
the CroAvn Prince’s Guardian Angel to be.”
“To hax-e been. Men don’t have Guardian
Angels.”
“German men do. The utilitarian genius
of Germany has evolved an adaptable Guard-
ian Angel that passes quite naturally from
the nursery to the stud.”
“I didn’t catch that?”
“Nothing, nothing; the pigsty again!
And now, my dear boy, what do you think
of my story?”
“You Avant me to believe that you stood
staring at those oleographs all night?”
“I want you to believe nothing. My
story stops there because my recollections
stop there.”
“Never even turned round once by mis-
take?”
“My story ends there.”
“Damn it all. what about the Avoman?”
“So far as my memory serves, there Avas
no Avoman.”
“Rats!” He stood up impatiently. The
Old Boy got up too, and put both hands on
his shoulders.
“So-help-me-God,” he said sloAA'ly, “I have
forgotten the woman utterly; I admit it
Avith deep shame.”
“But you mean to say”
“I mean to say only Avhat I have said —
all I can say.”
“But, surely, in the cab?”
"I recall no Avoman in the cab.”
“But she must have been there, because
you hung up her velvet cloak !”
“Ah !” The Old Boy’s hands gripped the
other’s shoulders. “Not till you are my age
Avill you realise the infinite pathos of that
little A-elvet cloak hanging for ever unclaimed
in the dusty lumber-room of an old man’s
memory. Her fading.image must have lin-
gered near my vagrant thoughts for weeks,
months, years even, flitting glimmers now
and then of a smile, or a pert action, or a
tress of hair —you understand? But at
last, while I AAent rollicking on through other
loA'es and other lives, her fading Avraith kneAv
she Avas not Avanted oA-en as a memory, and
so she slipped quietly axvay, like the little
lady most of them are deep down at heart,
and because the poor little ghost was so
hurt and flurried, she fox-got to take aAvay
Avith her the memory of her velvet cloak.
Do you knoAv that often of late years I have
forced myself to stroke velvet,' hoping the
shock might stir dead memories of her di-ess
—her face —her name? If only I could
recall her for one moment ! Just to kneel
in thought to her, and ask her forgiveness
for haA’ing forgotten all her beauty and ten-
derness, and remembered only the pigsty
horror of a German Guardian Angel! Good-
bye ! Good luck! I’m afraid I have kept
you.”
He turned away and very deliberately
laid the dead stump of his cigar in the ash-
tray. The l T oung Chap Avith a silent nod
hurried off.
DOWELL O'REILLY.
A Question for Maria.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILL reclined at full-length upon a
calloused elboAV, pulling at his after-
crib pipe and reading an ancient
newspaper. Except for Max-ia he Avas alone.
On all sides there Avas the bush, crowding
close upon the compact and liome-like camp
by the creek —a framed tent, a bough-roofed
“kitchen” wherein a billy and frying-pan
dangled, another bough-shed “sitting-room.”
“Our blokes,” said Bill, earnestly, “fought
like tigers, the paper says, Maria. ‘The
en’my bay’nets Avas sharper ’n’ longer ’n’
ours an’ most of ’em Avas ’eavier, but a kin
—kindergarden class might as Avell’ve tried
t’ keep the Australians off Avith ’atpins’....
Hell!”
Bill sat up and looked at his companion.
“Ain’t it about time f’r me t’ take a hand,
Maria?” he demanded.
Maria made no reply.
In the heat of noonday nothing stirred —
nothing but the vivid greenness rustling
overhead. Maria’s breathing w-as audible in
the stillness. A pencil of smoke arose from
Bill’s pipe, spread out and floated away.
From the Avealth of tropical blooms upon
the boughs above him an occasional pink
petal drifted down. The crib-lire supplied
an incense of fragrant ashes.
“Aw, Avell,” growled William, “I can’t
stay tied up ’ere all me life. The papdr
says: ‘Every man guessed Avhat Avas in
front of ’im. Over tld parapet they
Avent in three lines. Before it grew
light tAVO blanched troopers crept back an’
told the story. Our men Availed f’r any
sign of assault to avenge their fallen com-
rids.’ I oughter gid a move on. They say a
feller any good Avitli ’orses —watcher think?”
Maria remained silent.
“I got t’ make up me mind soon,” argued
Bill. "Not as though 1 ’ad t’ keep a farn’ly.
I got ten quid put by. Willie’s got t’ go
Aw right! I’m goin’!”
He arose and stretched himself, shook the
ashes out of his pipe and stepped from the
cool shade into the blazing Gulf sunshine.
Maria made no attempt to folloAV. Bill
paused a moment to glance back over his
shoulder.
“Come on,” he urged.
Maria came.
Up the stony hill track from the creek
Avent Bill, Maria following reluctantly, and
presently stopped at the little iron shack
Avithin which, flanked by a mountain of
gelignite boxes, the surface-foreman of the
Bower Bird sat at his desk, which Avas not a
desk at all, but a packing-case. The fore-
man looked up from dealing himself a few
hands of cards as Bill darkened the door-
way.
“I'll be takin’ me time in th’ mornin’,
boss,” said William. “Goin’ back with ol’
Bullseye’s team to th’ Coast. Goin’ t’ do
me bit.”
The foreman nodded through a lazily-
SAvirling tobacco-mist.
“Aav right,” he said, after a thoughtful
interval. “Aav right, Bill. Goin’ to give ’em
a twist, eh? Wish y’ luck. Come around at
knock-off, an’ we’ll drink it.”
“Righto,” said Bill. “Aav right, Jim” —
and turned once more into the sunshine.
He gave Maria a gentle thump in the ribs.
“Gid -urp!” lie grumbled, not unkindly;
“ this'll never gid us t’ Gallipoli!”
FRANK HENTY.
Fagan’s Bank.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ f I ALK about the good old times,” said
the cook. “I’ll just tell yis what I
know about yer good old times, and
then yis can think some more about ’em.
When I was on The Gulf (that’s Nerri-
gundy), in the early ’so’s, me and me mate
knocked a tidy bit of gold together; an’, on
the very night before the day we were to take
it to the bank at Moruyee, who should come
along but Tommy Clarke and Pat Connel,
and take us down for every skerrick of it,
besides frightenin’ me mate into an early
grave. He was a man with a weak heart,
was me mate. There was I left to find a
new mate, and to go to work again to pay
the storekeeper. Good old times them was!
What do yis think? Well, after about six
months’ more solid graft, I paid the store,
and got into Moruyee with my bit of gold.
It realised £ll and a few odd shillin’s.
“I was makin’ tracks for Braidwood with
me swag, and one of them knowall blokes, as
I had a couple of beers with, advised me to
get a bar of soap and put the eleven sovs.
away in it. He assured me, on the word of
a man, that it would be as right as a bank.
Well, I gets the bar of soap, and deposits
me eleven beautiful quids in it. Then I
puts the bank into me swag with me best
razor and other articles, any one of which
looked to be of mere valley than it, and
makes tracks for Bateman’s Bay, which I
reached O.K.
“From there I took the punt across, and
the old puntman—another knowall, he was
—mentioned something about puttin’ me
money, if I had any to speak of, away in a
bar of soap. Of course, I didn’t let on that
that was me game.
“Well, I got as far as Nelligen, on the
Clyde River, in good time, and had a few
beers at the old Steam Packet. In the bar
there Avas another of these knowall blokes
gassin’ about the bushrangers, and hoAv on
several occasions he had tricked ’em. And
hang me if he didn’t go on to tell lioav
once he had carried a lot of gold in a bar
of soap, which he reckoned was a saf<>
deposit.
“All this talk of soap and bushrangers
was getting on me nerves; so I shouldered
me swag, and let out for Braid wood, thirty
miles away. Just after midday I was on the*
top of the Clyde Mountain, and there I came
upon a bloke strippiu’ wattle-bark. lie was
just takin’ a damper—a beauty it was, and
smelt lovely—out of the hot ashes; and he
asked me to pertake of some of it and a
pot of tea with him. The damper was just I
the thing, but I’d have liked it much better
if he’d had some butter to soak into it
which he hadn’t. After the meal we lit up our
pipes, and started to have a good pitch.
After a hit he got on to the bushrangers—
it was Gilbert’s gang was out, and it had
stuck up Mcllroy, of Manaar, the night
before—and blow me if lie didn’t start
tellin’ of a feller who hid his wealth in a
bar of soap, and got through with it all,
notwithstandin’ the fact that he had been
stuck up twice. Tie was a decent felly
enough, this wattle-bark stripper, and had
treated me tip-top ; but when he got on the
soap racket I thought it time to toddle, and
I got.
“Well, I trudged on a bit over a mile, and
was just approaehin’ the old Blue Bell—
perhaps some of yis knows where that is?—
when out of*the bush rode two men. One
of them was Gilbert—l knew Johnny when
he was a blacksmith—and the other was the
bloodthirsty young Dunn, him as shot old
Sergeant Nelson at Gundaroo. There was I
like a hanged fool standin’ in the middle of
the road, covered ; but, all the same, I was
not oneasy, as I felt that my money was
safe, and that the bank would stand the
strain. Gilbert it was as had me covered,
and Dunn got off his moke, and went care-
fully through the swag. He took the bank,
smelt it, and weighed the thing, first in one
hand and then in the other. Then he winked
at Gilbert and reckoned I could put my
things together, and that he would take the
soap. lie said he hadn’t had a decent lather
since his mother washed him years ago, and
that lie would have a dip in the crick that
evening. The soap, he reckoned, was just
the thing for him. He reckoned, too, that a
swaggie had no need for soap, and he won-
dered why I had burdened myself with it on
the roads. With that I lost my temper, like
a bally goat, and w r as for rushing him. But
Gilbert never shifted his weapon, and he
had a wicked look in his eye; so, what could
I do?
“That night I reached Braidwood hungry,
footsore and savage, and with only the price
of a beer betwixt me and starvation. And,
hang me if. when I was havin’ the beer, ;
another coot didn’t start to tell me of a flash
Sydney barmaid who had taken the boss
down for about fifty sovs. that she had con-
cealed in a bar of soap. lie had read'll; in
a newspaper a week or so ago, and no doubt
Gilbert had been reading it to young Dunn.
“And yet yis talk about the good
old times! Let me hear no more of it
or there will be a vacancy in the camp, sure
as me name’s Fagan! Yis sicken me.”

Take Care Of your* Digestion
and your digestion will take care of you. At any rate, it is certain that
when you exercise care with regard to this important function you are
safe-guarding your health at its base. This is perfectly easy to under-
stand when it is remembered that unless the work of digestion and
assimilation is efficiently performed the system will not obtain the
nourishment it requires. It commonly happens when the stomach
becomes upset, that unless speedy attention is given to the matter, other
organs of the body suffer derangement, resulting in general ill-health.

HOW I ENLARGED MY BUST SIX INCHES
IN THIRTY DAYS
After I Had tried Pills, Massage, Wooden Cups and Various
Advertised Preparations without the slightest results.
A Simple, Easy Method which any Lady can use at
home and quickly obtain a large and beautiful Bust.
By MARGARETTE MERLAIN.
Well do I know the horrors and intense
humiliation of being flat-chested ; of having
the face of a woman set on the form of a
man; and I cannot find words to tell you
how good I felt, and what a terrible load
was lifted off my mind when I first saw my
bust had really grown six inches in size. I
felt like a new being, for with no bust I
realised I was really neither, a man nor a
woman, but just a sort of creature half way
between.
With what pity must every man look at
and have a bust like my own. I had been
imposed upon by charlatans and frauds, who
sold me all sorts of pills and appliances for
enlarging my bust, but which did me no good
whatever. I therefore determined my unfor-
tunate sisters should no longer be robbed by
those “fakirs” and frauds, and I wish to
warn all women against them.
The discovery of the simple process with
which I enlarged my bust six inches in thirty
days was due solely to a lucky acicdent,
which I believe was brought about by Divine
Providence, and as Providence was so good

every woman who presents to him a flat
chest —-a chest like his own! Can such a
woman inspire in a man those feelings and
emotions which can only be inspired by a
real and true woman, a woman with a
beautiful, well-rounded bust? Most certainly
not.
The very men who shunned me, and even
the very women who passed me carelessly by
when I was so horribly flat-chested and had
no bust, became my most ardent admirers
shortly after I obtained such a wonderful
enlargement of my bust. I therefore deter-
mined that all women who were flat-chested
should profit by my accidental discovery.
to give me the means to obtain a beautiful
bust, I feel I should give my secret to all
my sisters who need it. Merely enclose two
penny stamps for postage, and I will send
you particulars by return mail. (There is
of course no interruption to the regular mail
service between this country and England.)
I will positively guarantee that every lady
can obtain a Wonderful enlargement in her
bust in thirty days’ time, and that she can
easily use this process in the privacy of her
own house, without the knowledge of anyone.
