MAKING IT CLEAR
EDUCATION authorities have in
recent weeks issued a classic series of
statements about the supply of teachers.
The Federal Minister for Education,
Mr. Fraser, said that although 250
teachers had left - for Canada in one
week “those gained in recruits each
year far outnumbered those lost.”
The New South Wales Minister, Mr.
Cutler, said he was worried about
teacher shortages in some State schools,
but that there was no general shortage.
Then he admitted that there were
“staffing difficulties” in New South
Wales schools. Last week he got right
down to it and declared that Canada
had “broken a gentleman’s agreement”
by recruiting teachers here, so that
New South Wales had turned round
and recruited 21 teachers from
Canada. Mr. Cutler mightn’t have
enlightened anybody much about the
teacher supply, but he has made clear
what being a gentleman means.
ENDURING QUALITIES
THE GUM TREE seems an entirely
appropriate memorial to Adelaide artist
Hans Heysen, who died last week at
90; they share qualities of endurance.
When Heysen had his restrospective at
the 1966 Adelaide Festival, Geoffrey
Dutton produced an interesting histori-
cal perspective on Heysen and his
favorite subject.
Dutton wrote of the enthusiasm with
which our gardening ancestors
slaughtered the native qrums to replace
them with the “darkness of pine, the
luxuriant coolness of oak and elm and
poplar (not to mention ,the suckers),
and the correctness of cypress.” But
from the beginning of the century these
same people bought the gum-tree paint-
ings of McCubbin, Streeton, and
Roberts, and, slightly later, Heysen, to
hang on their walls.
Then architects, landscape gardeners,
and town-planners discovered the gum
tree. In the garden the gum tree was
“in,” but on the wall the gum tree was
a disaster. At the present time, for the
first time in our history, the gum tree
flourishes both in gardens and in the
paintings of distinguished artists such as
Fred Williams, Nolan, and Tucker.
“Through all these fluctuations of
taste,” Dutton wrote, “Hans Heysen
never wavered in his love of the gum
tree or in his pleasure in painting it.
Like Norman Lindsay with his eel-pond
of naked nymphs, he is happy to con-
tinue painting and drawing gum trees to
the end of his life. For Heysen (as for
Tucker and, probably, Nolan) the gum
tree is the tree of innocence.
“He is, in fact,” Dutton wrote, “a
walking example of his belief that
nature will give you health and balance
of mind if you give it your trust and
do not disturb its balance. In the cor-
ruption and violence of the present
world it seems too simple a belief. Yet
it is still possible to hold it in Australia.
The gum tree, all 500 kinds of it, may
have made a few gallows in its day, but
no jackboots have thumped beneath it,
and no conquering armies, no brothers
fighting brothers ever hung their cap-
tives from its boughs. Whether nature
itself be hostile or friendly, the gum
tree is the tree of innocence.”
ECHO FROM THE PAST
THE REPLACEMENT of Captain
A. J. Robertson by Captain J. D.
Stevens as commander of the first RAN
frigate flotilla at Garden Island last
week seemed to furnish a sad echo of
the Voyager inquiry in which the names
of two of the principal people involved
were the same.
IN ORBIT
AFTER WHAT SOUNDS rather like
seven years’ hard labor in London,
Italy, and Spain, David and Hermia
Boyd are back in Sydney weighed
down with canvas, pottery, and glass,
and ready to exhibit their work on a
national scale. “We didn’t get here
in time for the Melbourne show,” Boyd
said. “The exhibition of London images
at the Bonython Gallery, Adelaide,
opened last week. Later I’ll be show-
ing Australian work in Sydney, Bris-
bane, and Newcastle. Perth, too — but
I may have to miss that to get back
to London.” Hermia, who paints on
glass, will also have exhibitions in Syd-
ney (with Barry Stern), Adelaide, Bris-
bane, and Newcastle. As much as pos-
sible the Boyds avoid combined exhi-
bitions.
David Boyd regards his term in
Europe as something of a period of
exile. “London is a marvellous city, of
course,” he said. “It’s awe-inspiring at
first, frightening. To me it’s like a
Big Mum figure — a mum with too
many children to look after. If they
fall on the pavement it’s not out of
unkindness that she doesn’t notice
them.”
No one has had to pick the Boyds up
from the London pavements. Originally
going to Italy to take up a government
scholarship and enjoying for a year
the delights of Rome, where they had
a villa complete with fruit trees and
ducks, the artists decided to have a
look at London. Arriving in London
at the height of the Australian art
boom, David Boyd was encouraged to
give a one-man show of his Italian
work. It was extremely well received.
“For someone who had been con-
sistently bashed in Australia, it gave me
a great surge of confidence to be a
rave success in one of the biggest cities
in the world. It was the heyday of
the Australian success period. It has
receded now. It isn’t any longer open
sesame for the Australian artist of
merit who arrives unheralded in
Europe. But then the luck was high
and I feel -that the Australian work
stimulated English art — it didn’t
change its direction, of course but
the effect was made on younger artists.”
Boyd’s next work was evolved in
Spain, where he produced an exhibition
on Church and State. After this ca’me
a series of one-man shows, some of
which were also shown in Australia.
“I don’t any longer care what Aus-
tralian critics think. I used to feel
deeply wounded. I felt they were unjust
and, indeed, they went to extremes to
be vindictive. Even my personal
integrity was attacked. I gained confi-
dence in London and had this con-
firmed in Paris. With some notable
exceptions Australian critics must be
the lowest in the English-speaking
world. I find some very cocky
immature young chaps employed as art
critics.
“It has to be understood that art and
culture in the nation go together and
art leads the way. If it is constantly
rejected and squashed the country will
suffer. A country is only worth its
culture. In Australia the standard of
painting is high. Critics in Europe are
at a level of production to understand
it. The art of criticism in Australia is
so far behind the visual arts generally
that instead of evincing sympathy and
concern the critic tries to destroy.” So-
now he feels Australian critics are so
far out of orbit that their reviews can
only be regarded as inferior comment
and he has ceased to worry.

Australia”

tious objector Simon Townsend, and
—perhaps it was trouble with deadlines
■ —had him still being woken every
half hour by the Army when he was
back at his job with the Sydney “Sun.”
In the June 21 issue, Mr. C. H.
Rolph talks about the “fearful row”
when the Duke of Edinburgh ques-
tioned Sir Garfield Barwick’s asser-
tion that “Australia has no sharp
divisions based on religion.” This
matter probably got more inches in
the British Press than here, but then
the Duke is a bigger wheel in Britain
than Sir Garfield is here. In fact,
the Australian Press’ rallying round on
this probably saved the Duke’s visit
from passing almost unnoticed.
However, Mr. Rolph, then discard-
ing politics, feeling, perhaps, ill equip-
ped to deal with the Australian brand,
says, “It might be interesting to look
at one or two recent Australian church
events and consider the way in which
the ecclesiastical authorities out there
order their affairs.” (Out there!)
He writes: “In Sydney an anony-
mous priest wrote to the newspapers
saying that he and a ‘good and beauti-
ful woman’ were deeply in love. They
had found that ‘the agonised effort
to forget each other’ was only binding
them closer; and he didn’t see why a
priest should not marry and remain a
priest. Controversy raged. Roman
Catholic authorities closed their ranks,
priestly celibacy was once more traced
back to the 4th century AD, and the
anonymous rebel was told through the
public prints that he must see his
bishop.”
This certainly shows how far things
have gone. If it had happened in Lon-
don, no doubt Cardinal Heenan would
have said, “Come round on Saturday
afternoon, dear boy, and I’ll marry
you.” But not only is the Catholic
Church allowed to flourish here and
make its own rules for its members,
but well-meaning people are allowed
to write letters to the papers advising-
perplexed priests on what to do. At
least, those seem to be the points Mr.
Rolph is making.
GONE TO POT
“YOU BLEED a little,” the potter
Milton Moon said, standing before the
shards of $800 worth of pottery broken
in transit from Brisbane to Sydney. “But
I suppose i ! f you create something you
like—well, you’ve created it and that’s
what matters.”
Prices at Moon’s exhibition at Mac-
quarie Galleries, Sydney, vary from
“expressions of the wheel” at two and
three dollars to pats in the realm of
sculpture for $100. “You have,to charge
for creativity. I don’t care if the pieces
don’t sell. I like to keep them, as a
matter of fact.”
Blue-eyed, bearded, affable, ex-radio
and television personality Milton Moon
in the early ’fifties turned from tradi-
tional painting to a lasting love affair
with the potter’s wheel. “At that time
people had a Woolworth’s taste for pot-
tery. In the fifteen years between I
know my style has grown with me—
and the public acceptance of serious
pottery has grown, too.”
He teaches at the Queensland Depart-
ment of Technical Education and
Queensland University so that he can
be free to work only in the creative
forms which interest him. His students
are young architects, for the most part
learning “material expression” con-
cerned with metal, glass, epoxy resins,
even film-making.
“I really have a very normal exist-
ence,” Moon said, puffing away at a
pipe in the back room of the galleries
against a background of shattered pots.
“A wife, son, a dog, a cat, and a
mother-in-law.”
The artist is not seduced by Bris-
bane’s golden sunshine. He works
prodigiously beside his kiln often wear-
ing nothing but a pair of old shorts. A
foundation Churchill Fellowship two
years ago gave him an opportunity to
visit 14 countries, including America,
Scandinavia, Finland, Italy, Spain,
France, and the United Kingdom. Mil-
ton Moon returned literally to his own
backyard.
“I like it. I don’t think one’s work
suffers from being away from the main-
stream. It’s comfortable to crawl , back
to your own surroundings. I may be
wrong in this. I don’t know. I realise
that ceramicists in the big American
universities have a fabulous life, but. I
have no plans to go back there to
work.”
To him ceramics is an art form on
its own half painting, half sculp-
tural. “I don’t envisage shifting my
allegiance again, but you don’t decide
these things—they happen.”

If countries thousands of miles away,
such as Japan, China, and Russia, find

Are you an
"empty-nester"?
This is an American term; it in-
dicates that your children have
grown up, have got married and
have left the “nest”.
And now you and your wife —and
maybe the youngest, who is pro-
bably grown-up—are left in that
great big house.
And it seems empty.
So what did you do? You and
your wife have spent a great deal
of fruitless time in inspecting
smaller places. Naturally enough,
if you’re going to sell your old
home and move after all these
years, you’re not prepared to
squeeze yourselves into one of
the many so-called “compact”
units that you’ve been looking at.
And, in any case, you know you
are not going to be very happy
living in a great big tall block of
flats, sharing a lift and facilities
with dozens —or hundreds —of
other people.
And you’re going to miss your
own garden even though you
swear that it has made a slave
of you over all these years.
There is an answer to your pro-
blem. It’s not a cheap answer,
admittedly, but, in the words of
the famous cigarette commercial,
is “for those for whom only the
best will do”.
So come and see the Penthouses,
at 58-61 New Beach Road, 23-29
Yarranabbe Road, Darling Point.
There are only a few homes left.
Each has a magnificent harbour
view, a huge terrace, a little Jap-
anese garden, car-parking by the
front gate, no lifts, and absolutely
luxurious 2/3 bedroom accommo-
dation (14 to 18 squares) all on
one level.

OPERATION
GOLD COAST
DOES THE TRICK
YOUR CORRESPONDENT is in
residence at the Pink Poodle Motel,
Surfers Paradise, w.w. carps., swg. pi.,
TV, patio, and pr. bar. This is the new
trend in motel naming. After the Santa
Ana, Bali Hai, Aloha era we have
moved definitely South Yarra. Ah, yes,
the old optimism has returned and it’s
just like old times. L. J. Hooker has
announced a $4 million development
for the centre of town, which, we are
told, will do for Surfers what the Aus-
tralia Square did for Sydney. Indeed,
it even has a ten-storey round tower.
Round towers are in. Ted Fong has
built a new Cafe Cathay and soon it
will sport a marvellous 15ft.-long
dragon, 9ft.-high brass head, and all
that breathes fire. Bernie Elsey, of the
Beachcomber and Tiki Village, is doing
so well one hears that he has a new
project almost finished at Daydream
Island, off Mackay. This, among other
things, will have a huge swimming-pool
with a licensed island in the centre. In
other words, it will be a wet swimming-
pool, where swimmers will swim to the
centre for a drink. Also, Daydream
Island will have a sun-lovers’ nudist
beach, where sun-lovers will bathe in
the altogether. It will be utterly
secluded, and bare sun-lovers will be
able to approach it only from the water.
What else? Well, suddenly land
prices in the Gold Coast hinterland
have begun to soar. By the planting of
legumes in this high-rainfall area cattle-
men are running up to four beasts to the
acre. So we are getting a new type of
cattleman who lives 30 miles from a
surf beach and even visits the Pink
Poodle at weekends. Why, some even
live at Surfers and drive to their
properties every day. And there is a
new type of estate agent, Tony Crisp.
Tony wears a broad hat, twill trousers
with cross-type saddle pockets, a kan-
garoo-hide belt, and elastic-sided boots.
In the foyers he has displays of cattle-
dip, stock-feed supplement, and his
furniture, where the cattlemen sign their
cheques, is even smoother than Harry
Seidler.
Bruce Small, the millionaire mayor,
is getting up as early as ever. He has a
new dream, an inland waterway where
speedboats could travel by bay, canal,
and river 100 miles a'll the way from
Brisbane to Murwillumbah. All he
needs is one 250 ft. tunnel at Tulle-
budgera and another at Currumbin. Not
only will it make for flood mitigation,
but it will open up endless Venetian-
type waterways for, as Mr. Humhpries
would say, “glorious housing schemes.”
Right this minute there are a great
many hideously empty beds on the
Coast; the Pacific Highway is an avenue
of glittering VACANCY signs, but the
bookings coming up are splendid. All
this is due to a brilliant public-relations
coup; the sand strip which was built by
PR has gone on to a new triumph—-
Operation Gold Coast.
As Bruce Small explained, the idea
was to take the mountain to Mahomet
and Mahomet back to the mountain.
The transportation of Mahomet, that
is, the assorted collection of official,
meter maids, courtesy maids, bikini
girls, and such, was all financed by
TAA. Then the transportation of the
mountain back to Mahomet at Surfers,
the assorted collection of radio, TV, and
Press people was all by courtesy of
Ansett-ANA.
And unquestionably someone up
there liked the Gold Coast, for when
Mahomet turned up in Melbourne the
weather was superbly miserable. Geri
Engleton, dressed in nothing but a
bikini, stood at the corner of Swanston
and Flinders Street in miserable rain
and satisfyingly near-freezing con-
ditions and handed out copies of the
Gold Coast “Sun.” This was sufficient
to give her almost the whole of the
front page of the Melbourne “Sun” and
later she was cited back home in Surfers
for her heroism.
Bruce Small said: “I never believed
it would have been possible to go into
The Gold Coast . . . “the bookings coming up are splendid”

a city and saturate it so simply.” The
newspapers were filled with the Gold
Coast all the week. In the first four
days they received hours’ free time
on radio and four hours’ free on tele.-
vision. In the midst of all this, Senator
Kennedy was assassinated. Bruce Small
said: “I thought we were ruined. Yet
an hour and a half after the announce-
ment at 6 p.m. we were on Mike
Preston’s ‘ln Melbourne Tonight’ and
we had a marvellous run; I even
adorned Mike Preston with the
mayoralty chain of the Gold Coast.”
There were little problems. Kathy
Wells represented the Golden Four
Beaches, that is, Tugin, North Kirra,
Balinga, and Currumbin, on the way
to Coolangatta. The theory was that
Coolangatta was for the young, Surfers
for the gilt, fancy-cufflink trade, but
the Golden Four was for the family,
so they wanted Kathy Wells to look
a suitably modest Miss and they sent
her down in a one-piece swimsuit. The
result was she received no publicity at
all. Poor Kathy sent an urgent wire
for a bikini, then immediately her pic-
ture made the newspapers.
There were also problems in giving
away literature. The girls knew the
rules. They stood in the entrance of
TAA, not on the footpath, and handed
it to passersby. However, on one
occasion, Kathy Wells put her foot on
the pavement to give a brochure to a
gentleman and she was nabbed by a
council inspector. Immediately she
called the “Herald” and this made for
more marvellous publicity.
There were three separate flights
bringing the mountain up north—this
was the Small plan. On each of three
days he rose at 4.30 a.m., had break-
fast, drove to Brisbane, and then flew
to Sydney to meet the special Mel-
bourne aircraft. Then he flew with the
Press team to Coolangatta. But that
wasn’t all. He had a special dispensation
from Civil Aviation to fly low along the
Coast. As soon as the aircraft reached
the Gold Coast he had a microphone
with a long lead and he described all
features, including his “improved”
beach. So one side of the aircraft saw
all, then the aircraft flew back the other
way so the other side could see all.
The result: even before the mission
left Melbourne the Queensland Tourist
Bureau was receiving orders which beat
even the Christmas rush; Ansett-ANA
has increased bookings by 50 percent
and TAA’s orders also are way up.
Ansett’s booked 153 packaged holidays
in one day. Alderman Small said he
didn’t dare to think he could repeat
such a publicity performance in a
sophisticated city like Sydney, but, with
the gimmicks lined up, he says Sydney
already plans to outperform Melbourne.
The Sydney Mahomet treatment oper-
ates from July 14. Then there will be
a Small attack on Tasmania, Adelaide,
and New Zealand.
It is all quite brilliant. If Mr. Whit-
lam really wants to become Prime
Minister, could one suggest a campaign
manager, 72-year-old Alderman Bruce
Small. He would win by 50 seats.


'
Ever'fry'an egg at minus 320°F.?
That's just one stunt to show how fast
liquid nitrogen can freeze just about
anything. First, break an egg into a frying
pan. Then pour in the liquid nitrogen.
Instantly, the egg looks cooked. But it
isn't. It's frozen solid.
Nitrogen has come a long way since
those early kitchen capers. Today, the
Australian food industry uses CIG liquid
nitrogen in many ways. Most notable among
these are for the refrigeration of frozen
food transport vehicles...and in the
freezing of most types of food. CIG
nitrogen gas, however, is used to
permeate products, from wines to
edible oils, and displace all oxygen.
This process, called 'sparging', helps
keep products at their best in taste and
appearance longer than was previously
possible. You'll always see CIG sticking
their nose into just about everything.
To see what cooks. To see what can
be done more efficiently, effectively
and with far greater economy.

THE SOCIAL SET
PLAYING THE
WIMBLEDON GAME
IT IS noon on Sunday and, thank
God, the first time this Wimbledon
fortnight the sun is shining, and tennis
champion Lew Hoad and his wife,
Jenny, are giving a party i n the garden
of actor Sean Connery’s Putney house.
The guests are milling around with
drinks and everyone’s exhausted.
The thing is, the first open Wimble-
don, the greatest and most glamorous
All-England Lawn Tennis Champion-
ships ever staged, has worn everyone
to shreds. The rain. The train strike.
All that £375 debenture stock, which
is another way of saying season ticket,
that zoomed to £650 value when it
was announced the pros were coming,
well, what’s the point now? The BBC
hangs around with its 12 color units,
in full force this year. It’s desperate.
Will the British public ever see Princess
Marina sucking her customary boiled
sweets in the royal box, or Princess
Margaret arriving fractionally late just
as the game’s starting? The excitement
of all that prizemoney, £2150 in toto,
is beginning to pall, too. Australian
former finalist Martin Mulligan, who
lives in Italy, hasn’t bothered with
Wimbledon this year. There’s not
enough cash, he says, to make the trip
worth while.
Lew is passing out drinks with blis-
tered hands and saying the worst bit
was waiting for the rain to stop. And
then going in to play without a knock-
up. Actually, says New Zealander
John MacDonald, the other side of the
garden, the reason why people lose
is because they are too confident. He
knew the precise moment when Lew
lost his singles. And he had it in his
hands. Lew, he says afterwards, what
happened? I got cocky and let up, says
Lew. Jenny is greeting guests and
everyone’s saying how ghastly it was
for her to be slammed by that British
No. 1 seed Ann Jones. Well, it was
that damned dress Teddy Tinling made
her wear, too tight at the neck. Jenny
wanted it shorter, but Tinling said no.
“Well, darling,” says a friend, “you
did get one game.” But it is pleasant
to see the sun. The girls with their
Spanish tans and Chanel chain hand-
bags and knicker-revealing dresses. And
the men in clinging seersucker shirts,
and one Australian, Alan, in cling-
cling seersucker trousers. Hell, he says,
it is summer today.
What makes this party different from
most is the absence of nonentities. The
situation turns into one of everybody
holding individual court all round the
garden. “I suppose,” says comedian
Frankie Howerd, in a new auburn wig,
to Abe Segal (poured into a black
skivvy and being very South African,
ignoring female conversational contri-
butions), “I suppose leading your sort
of life you are feted wherever you go?”
Mr. Segal inclines his head graciously.
Yes. That would be accurate. So how
does he look after his figure? Mr. Segal
has a rapt audience: Frankie Howerd,
who gets fat looking at carbohydrate,
a friend of his whose contribution is
one long, permanent smile, and a butch
girl who tries to utter but is cut off.
What Mr. Segal does is take to the
sauna.
Well, there is Roy Emerson, who’s
swathed in grey wool, Frank Sedgman
with a hurt arm, now he shaves back-
hand, Pancho Segura giving advice to
Ray Moore, who strokes his blond
mutton-chop whiskers and takes it all in.
There’s Bobby Riggs, Jack Kramer in
pale blue, Scobie Breasley, Keith
Miller, the cricketer, Heather Segal, a
long girl in white trouser-suit, she’s
mad about English clothes but nothing
kinky, thank you, Butch Bucholz in
yellow pants, holding up the roses: he’s
so tired he could drop. He got to bed
at 4 a.m., and Beverley Hilton, Jack
Hilton’s widow, in backless orange, and
Shirley Abicair, in buttoned-up orange,
saying she’s gonna take up the banjo,
and designer Jon Bannenburg, who’s
doing the Q. 4 and today wearing an
Injun outfit, and that English actor Leo
Genn with his wife and their golden
retriever who is called Silver. Mrs.
Genn has to explain she gave it to Leo
on their silver wedding. And everyone’s
keeping a tired eye open for Peter
Ustinov and Sammy Davis and Charl-
ton Heston, who are expected. “Actu-
ally,” says Alan, tweeking his seer-
suckers, “Sammy Davis does nothing
for me. There’s a couple here who’ve
written a best-selling book about him,
it bored me to sobs. Now they’re doing
one on tennis pros, they must be mad.”
And all around:
“. . . Tennis like the stage —let up
and you’re lost . .
“. . . My dear, the latest shop’s called
‘I Was Lord Kitchener’s Thing’ . . .”
“. . . Hairdresser Rene in the royal
box at Wembley with Princess Alex-
andra . . .”
“. . . Don’t tell me you never bathed
your feet in a bidet . . .”
“. . . And I said who’s that bird with
the thick, stumpy legs, and he said
that’s my wife ...”
“. . . Men’s paper underpants, £1 for
24 . . .”
And Alan does an abandoned dance
round the goldfish pond and says why
do English women shake hands all the
time, what’s the matter with English
parties, anyway? They never get off the
ground. Back home in Sydney they’d be
rolling by now. So it is 4 o’clock and
the clouds descend and if they’re to
make it to color television and see a
bit of Wimbledon in comfort they’d
better leave now. To avoid those
damn’d traffic jams and ghastly trippers
returning from the seaside in their
charabancs.
Alan says he’s sick of tennis. He’s
gonna drag off his seersuckers and go
to bed.


Dravo can design and build the nuclear power plants to light up tomorrow
Dravo Corporation, which con-
structed the world's first commer-
cial nuclear power reactor eleven
years ago, has the staff and ex-
perience necessary to design,
engineer and construct complete
power facilities —both nuclear
and fossil fueled. In fact, services
to the electric power industry
accountfor over two-thirds of the
engineering performed by Gibbs
& Hill, Inc., a Dravo subsidiary.
which places that firm among the
leaders in power engineering.
Gibbs & Hill's experience with
nuclear energy goes back to the
"Manhattan project" during
World War 11. Later came work
on atomic submarines and re-
search particle accelerators. In
1955, G & H designed Europe's
first operating pressurized-water
nuclear power plant. Since then,
services have been provided on
nuclear power projects valued at
more than a billion dollars, in-
cluding Europe's largest pressur-
ized-water plant near Zurich.
Dravo nuclear engineering
services include national surveys
of power potentials; technical
and economic feasibility studies;
plant design, specification and
construction ; personnel training ;
and plant start-up.
Designing nuclear and con-
ventional power facilities is but
one of Dravo's special talents.
Your problem may call for others,
such as waste and water treat-
ment, mass transit system design,

TRAINING AN ELITE FOR AUSTRALIA
Comment by'Observer'
IT IS as depressing to read Peter
Samuel’s estimate (page 36) of the
significances of the changes in the
Defence Department as it was refresh-
ing to learn that at least some changes
were on the way.
The issues go beyond the Defence
Department itself. They embrace the
whole question of how, in the future,
we can incorporate into Australia those
systems of decision-making that have
been described as “the use and system-
atic perfection of all the instruments of
reason” so that, operating in an open
society in which people are capable of
continuing regeneration by continuing
education, human communities might
finally be characterised by some of that
intelligence that, as individuals, dis-
tinguishes us from the other species.
And what’s more, it’s likely that it is
only by becoming more clever that
Australians will be able to maintain
their status as one of the world’s most
prosperous countries.
This will soon go beyond the ques-
tion of manufacturing. In the industrial
age of human history the ability to
make things was the prime economic
question. But as a society becomes
“affluent” (viz., solves its problems of
production) proportionately less of its
resources go into manufacturing and
more of them into the tertiary indus-
tries, which not only service manufac-
turers but serve us all in so many of
the things that seem really to matter
to us in our lives.
In this, Australia has a chance to
exploit its own luck. Either that, or
it runs a terrible risk. We have been
able to enjoy the fruits of the industrial
and technological ages mainly by being
derivative —we haven’t had to show
much innovation ourselves. But as the
relative importance of manufacturing
declines we still have a chance to dis-
play in other fields the chances we have
missed in the industrial age. But there
is a special challenge here; unlike manu-
facturing, in which we can get by on
the cleverness of foreigners, in some
of these other fields we shall have to do
It ourselves.
Of these other fields the most not-
able example is the whole range of
activities that are part of the apparatus
of government. Either decision-
making in the government agencies is
influenced by the new standard of
cleverness —or we miss out. The
Americans can’t put in a takeover bid
for the Departments of Education, or
the Japanese for the agencies of Town
Planning. Either we learn to be better
at these things ourselves or we fail to
exploit the potentials of the future.
For the moment the prospects are
not good. The successful decision-
making of the future looks as if it will
rest on two kinds of educated people.
At 'the top of an organisation, not only
technical experts but people with the
education and training to systematise
decision-making. And throughout the
rest of an organisation people whose
talents, although mediocre, have been
strengthened by some kind of tertiary
education. As things stand now we have
no plans for extending tertiary educa-
tion more widely so that the mediocre
can enjoy some of its benefits; and we
are frighteningly weak in institutions
that can train clever men in systematic
decision-making. What’s more —in
both politicians and government officials
there is still a very strong antipathy
to the very ideas of both system and
brilliance. The ordinary Australian
people, although not well enough
educated are nevertheless highly “mod-
ern” in their potential adaptability and
readiness for change if leadership
can show a new direction.
As well as planning a crash program
for training a modern, westernised elite
in New Guinea, we should perhaps now
be debating what kind of crash program
could best train a modern, westernised
elite for Australia. It is one of the prob-
lems of the British, for example, that
when they had their great debate on
this subject last century it was more for
the purpose of training an elite to run
an Empire than to take over the indus-
trial revolution from the amateurs who
had Begun it, whereas in the other
nations that were to become major in-
dustrial nations the U.S.A., Ger-
many, Japan, France there was to be
a deliberate policy of changing educa-
tional policy to meet new circumstances.
In all of these nations there is now new
debate—about what new changes should
now be made in education to meet the
new circumstances of the future. Yet
Australia has never had such a debate.
Demand for such decisions is now
expressing itself in a disorganised way
among the Australian business bureauc-
racies and it must surely soon also
come from the government bureauc-
racies. But there is little sign that our
educational institutions know what to
do about it. And just as depressing
there is little sign that in business
and government bureaucracies it is
sufficiently understood that this is a
matter that extends beyond specialist
skills. It is also a question of general
education at the top, and through
to the bottom, a fact that our institu-
tionalised egalitarianism would be pre-
pared to welcome if it were not for
our institutionalised dislike of brains.
THE TYRANNY OF THE MINORITY
Comment by Alan Reid
PRIME MINISTER John Gorton has
used the phrase “tyranny of the minor-
ities” to describe attempts to enforce
by unlawful actions views rejected by
the majority on the last occasion they
had the opportunity to express their
opinions. Gorton was applying his
words to demonstrators against the
Vietnam War, against the National
Service Act, which is the legal base
for the call-up for compulsory National
Service, and against the United States
for its part in the Vietnam War.
The word “tyranny” might at first
glance appear a politician’s colorful
overstatement. At this stage it could
be. But on recent development it
could be prophetic. Looked at quite
impartially, demonstrators who are pre-
pared to transgress the law, particularly
the university students, have already
had a measure of success. They have
moved some way toward establishing a
position in which they are privileged
outside and above the law. There
are also indications that their psycho-
logical intimidation is having its effect
upon highly sophisticated people, such
as the Vice-Chancellor of the Aus-
tralian National University, Professor
Sir John Crawford. These people are
showing signs that they are moving
toward acceptance of the proposition
that those who participate in mass
demonstrations are entitled to a special
legal status, superior to that of the
ordinary citizen

any professor has expressed hostility to
one section of the community being
given immunity from the law that
applies to other sections of the com-
munity, he has 'been unsuccessful in hav-
ing his views publicised.
I cannot bring myself to accept the
thesis that minority groups are entitled
to a privileged legal status, merely be-
cause they are minority groups, or
because of a claim, quite unprovable
until the next general elections, that
they are, in fact, not minorities but in
some mystic way the genuine expres-
sion of the viewpoint of the majority.
Mr. Gorton is sensitive about the
rights of minorities, but all politicians
have to preserve a balanced viewpoint
between majority and minority rights.
A section of the Liberal Party is urging
that the producers of the pamphlet des-
cribing how to avoid military service
and outlining sabotage methods for
those who fail to avoid it should be
prosecuted. There is some legal opinion
which supports the view that the
pamphlet is not an expression of views
but an incitement to sabotage.
If acts of sabotage occurred, those
responsible for the acts would be dealt
with. If, in the course of dealing with
those acts of sabotage, it emerged that
the offender or offenders had been in-
cited to perform them by the pamphlet,
then action could be taken against the
publishers and distributors. With the
issue clear cut as to whether the pamph-
let constituted a viewpoint or advocacy
of illegal acts.
I for one was quite shocked by an
official statement put out by the Aus-
tralian National University on behalf
of Sir John Crawford on June 12 after
a lunchtime meeting with students. Sir
John is a man who knows words and
is accustomed to using them precisely.
Speaking of the requirements of the
National Service Act, he said no
inquiries, such as the Act authorised
the Government to make, had been
made to the Australian National Uni-
versity and he hoped that this would
continue to be the position.
But, added Sir John, “should it
prove otherwise under new legisla-
tion when finally enacted I will
decide my own course of action in the
light of any approach made to me,
seeking legal advice and the views of
the University Council as may seem
appropriate.”
Try as I can, I can see no other
interpretation to that but that Sir John
will obey the law only if he decides
that he wants to obey the law. He will
decide his “own course of action.” Pos-
sibly the students to whom he was
speaking had a more esoteric under-
standing of words than I have. But if
I were one of the students he was
addressing I would, in my innocence,
feel entitled to assume that Sir John
would obey the law only if he agreed
with the way it was being applied.
And if that were good enough for Sir
John, a man who has occupied some
of the highest Public Service posts in
this country, it would be good enough
for me.

AUSTRALIA
What happened to the Gurindji
and their land?
DID THE stockmen of Wave Hill
win or lose their two-year struggle for
a bit of northern Australia? No one
seemed to know after the Sydney Cabi-
net meeting. There was no official
statement, but, of course, Ministers
spoke off the record. It appeared
different Ministers had different ver-
sions of what had, in fact, been re-
solved.
Mr. Wentworth, the Minister for
Aboriginal Affairs, went to Cabinet
suggesting that the Gurindji tribe be
granted a lease of ten square miles and
given assistance to build a settlement
there. The Gurindji had petitioned for
500 square miles, wanting to develop
their own cattle ranch, and they
claimed that since this was their tribal
land they had the rights to it. But
the land is part of a property owned
by the powerful British firm of Vesteys,
and properties all over the Territory
saw their leases threatened by the move.
All local political groups Country
Party, Labor Party, and, less directly,
the Liberals, consolidated to oppose
the proposal.
Mr. Wentworth, however, after hav-
ing visited the area, said that he
thought they deserved help and that
he sympathised with their claims. It
just was not “on” politically for the
Gurindji tribe to be given the full
500 square miles they demanded.
Mr. Wentworth wanted them given a
Wentworth ... taken for a ride?
compromise amount, evidently more
than the reported ten square miles.
But he got a complete drubbing in
the Cabinet room. Mr. Hasluck started
by pointing out that integration was
the accepted policy for Aboriginals and
that any land grant would be inconsis-
tent with this. It would create an
Aboriginal enclave: which, of course,
was what Mr. Wentworth believes
should be done where the Aboriginals
themselves want it.
But it was not this point on which
Mr. Wentworth lost. Another senior
Minister —thought to be Mr. McMahon
—introduced the claim that most of
the Gurindji tribe had in fact dis-
appeared from the area and that they
no longer wanted the cattle ranch. The
latest information of the 300 for whom
Mr. Wentworth wanted land was that
only 17 men were still in the area.
Of these, ten were on unemployment
benefits, another five on the age pen-
sion, and the other two were eking
out a living somehow or other.
Minister for the Interior Nixon, who
administers the Territory, confirmed
that there were only a handful left.
Most of the 300 on behalf of whom Mr.
Wentworth spoke had drifted off to
work elsewhere. He reported that none
of them anymore wanted to proceed
with the cattle ranch. All they wanted
was a post office to save them travel-
ling for their dole.
At one stage Prime Minister Gorton
is believed to have told Mr. Wentworth
he had been taken for a ride by Frank
Hardy, the Communist writer who has
been championing the Gurindji cause.
Mr. Wentworth furiously denied this,
but Mr. Nixon cut in, saying he had
had them checked out thoroughly.
What was needed at this stage was a
compromise to get Mr. Wentworth off
the hook. Mr. Nixon proposed an offer
to the remaining Gurindji: they would
be helped to move to an existing re-
serve nearby or else given 1000 acres
1.5 square miles for housing.
But there was a problem with the
lease. What happened if they accepted
it and then disappeared?
A decision “in principle” to offer
this choice to the remaining Gurindji
was made, with Mr. Nixon and Mr.
Wentworth delegated to work out the
details. Ministers were saying that next
time they expected Mr. Wentworth to
get his brief safe from challenge before
he brought his submissions to Cabinet.
Red-Guard-capped demonstrator in
Melbourne last week
The students
A week on the
wild side
UNDER FOUR PERCENT of Aus-
tralia’s 80,000 or so students demon-
strated, in one way or another, last
week (at least 50 percent of that
minority non-violently) and fewer than
80 of them were arrested but such
is the way of mass media dramatising
violence that Australians might easily
have been given the impression that
the streets were spattered with blood.
In fact, the Melbourne “Age” front-
paged a “color” story of home-city
student violence on July 4 which made
Melbourne sound like any riot-torn
city of Europe or the U.S.A. in recent
months. A sample: “(The troopers’)
horses, rearing and frothing from fright,
sent men and women reeling to the
bitumen. Other people were trampled
underfoot by protesters as they tried
to escape the horses . .
Strangely, the 120 police who were
present at the stoning of the U.S. Con-
sulate General, and the many at Rus-
sell St. police headquarters when the
demonstraters went there, managed to
single out and arrest only about 50


Brisbane...a quiet march
people. But the account, with pictures,
took up about three-quarters of the
front page.
The students in Melbourne may have
come from any or all of the city’s
three universities, in unknown num-
bers. After an hour’s quiet protest, they
began to burn petrol-soaked American
flags on the street. A student was
arrested and soon stones were breaking
the Consulate’s windows, mounted
police were trying to break up the
crowd, police and demonstrators were
punching one another, and a sit-down
to immobilise police wagons was broken
up by the mounted police.
By then an estimated 2000 people
outside the Consulate included trade
unionists, members of various anti-Viet-
nam War groups, and curious by-stand-
ers as well as students. About half of
this crowd walked a half mile or so
to the Australian-American Club, and
the really earnest activists went on to
demonstrate at police .headquarters,
where some more of them were
arrested.
In a contrast which may be very
relevant, Sydney’s universities threw up
only about 200 active student dissenters
on two occasions this week, on the
afternoon and evening of the Univer-
sity of N.S.W.’s Foundation Day last
Tuesday, and on the night of July 4,
American Independence Day.
On Foundation Day, this small
number tried to harass Federal Minis-
ters attending a Cabinet meeting in
Sydney. The N.S.W. police, told to re-
sist any .such harassment forcefully, did
just that, treating the students as they
would have any other group of people
acting similarly. When the tussling got
rough, word soon spread among other
students in the city for the day, and
hundreds more went to join what
looked to police like a gathering mob.
According to one commercial TV chan-
nel commentator, many of the police
removed their identification numbers
and began to manhandle the more pug-
nacious and abusive students with “a
shocking degree of violence.”
The Thursday night sit-ins in Syd-
ney were similar to one held at the
Commonwealth Offices in Martin
Place the week before, when a senior
policeman collapsed and died. Again,
“COURIER-MAIL”
Sydney ... tussling got rough
"DAILY TELEGRAPH"
fewer than 200 students of the tens of
thousands at Sydney’s universities took
part. These limited numbers cast a
fairly reasonable doubt on the sup-
posedly high proportion of students
among the estimated 2000 violent de-
monstrators in Melbourne last week.
Students seem as puzzled as anyone
about the true strength of the activists
among them. In the Foundation Day
“Tharunka,” a Melbourne student cor-
respondent, in attempting to compare
radicalism at Monash and the Uni-
versity of N.S.W., was unable to de-
cide whether Monash’s radicals were
“a hard core of perhaps a dozen Red-
Guard-cap-wearers and a circle of
compulsive youth who will do almost
anything which has a cause.”
Many of the small minority of
student activists are uncertain of their
directions, too, and seem to sway with
the moment’s winds. The Brisbane Civil
Liberties march last week, after losing
the support of the University Union,
became a quiet affair, without pamph-
lets or confrontation with the police.
It had an anti-Vietnam character (held
on July 4, of course), as did the Perth
students’ march on the same day.
In Vietnam the Prime Minister dis-
missed some student demonstrators as
“nuts.” It is possible that, in determin-
ing to come down hard on future
violent student demonstrations, the
Federal Government is proposing to
use the sledgehammer for its proverbial
non-use.
Victorian Labor
A difference on State Aid
IT WAS E. G. Whitlam and the
Federal Labor Executive writ small
when, three weeks after the Victorian
Labor Conference, State Secretary
Hartley reminded Parliamentary Leader
Holding that the Victorian policy on
State Aid was to be against it.
Writing in a regular newspaper
column, Hartley said any doubts about
the issue had been removed at the
June conference and that the policy
was binding on the State Parliamentary
Party.
Although his words were not belliger-
ent, they must have struck Mr. Holding
as rather pointed, considering his
declared position in favor of State Aid
and his repeated assertions that he felt
bound by the Federal Party’s platform
on the issue.
Mr. Hartley had said that Victoria
would oppose State Aid until a change
in Federal policy. When it was changed
to include some form of grant, then
Victoria would follow “as far as
Federal jurisdiction extends.” He be-
lieved that the present policy did not
require State Aid and indeed gave a
discretion to the various State parties
to oppose it. Mr. Holding believed the
opposite.
Obviously annoyed at having his
parliamentary responsibilities canvassed
in public, Mr. Holding replied with a
firmly worded statement. “It is a mat-
ter of grave concern to me . . . that
the State secretary should make public
declarations concerning the position of
the State Parliamentary Labor Party.”
Interference by a Party officer in the
day-to-day running of the Parliamentary
Party would create an unworkable
relationship, he said. “This is, we hope,
the last occasion in which public com-
munication will be used to the exclusion
of established channels of communica-
tion.”
The incident followed more ruffled
disagreements .between Mr. Hartley and
both Mr. Holding and Mr. Whitlam in
past months. The outspoken comments
on Australia’s Vietnam involvement and
on relations with the DLP which had
been written or authorised by Mr.
Hartley were resented by politicians
who don’t like being treated as mere
delegates of the Party machines. This
disagreement was further aggravated by
the executive’s plan to prepare, off its
own bat, an Abortion Bill for presen-
tation in Parliament.
On the day after the Press statement,
Holding, for
Hartley, against


Mr. Holding and Mr. Hartley met at
the monthly meeting of the Party and
parliamentary executives. The next
morning Mr. Hartley declined to com-
ment further, apart from agreeing that
the Federal policy was not too clear.
As chairman of Labor’s National Com-
mittee on Education, which would meet
next month, he said the whole matter
would be canvassed with the hope of
presenting an entirely new platform to
Federal Conference.
Mr. Holding also felt that the word-
ing of the platform required more pre-
cision, but had no doubt that in a case
of clear conflict between Federal and
State policy the Federal view prevailed.
Having committed himself last year to
an election promise by the previous
Leader, Mr. Stoneham, of a $3 million
grant to independent schools, Mr. Hold-
ing is well aware that in Victoria, at
least, State Aid is one of the political
facts of life.
Crime
The egotist
GLENFIELD is one of those raw
suburbs on the south-western edge of
Sydney still waiting to acquire the state
of settled completeness that the vision-
ary advertising of land developers
attaches to every building block beyond
the sewerage line. The city of Sydney
is 24 miles away by rail and 25 by
road, a journey that winds through the
harsh flatness of Liverpool and the
unattractive miles of second-hand car
yards along the Hume Highway.
Until last week, Glenfield was a
slumbering suburb with no sense of
destiny and nothing to distinguish it
on the map except a nearby veterinary
research station and a partly built
agricultural high school. Now it has
an unwanted notoriety that will dog it
for years; a reputation abroad that
immigration officials might find more
clearly understood among potential
settlers than Australia’s social-welfare
facilities.
Wally Mellish, a 23-year-old psycho-
path a young man with a growing
police record moved into a fibro
cottage in Glenfield Road, Glenfield,
on July 1, and within 12 hours had
begun a siege against the might of the
N.S.W. police force that strained public
credibility. Mellish moved into the
house with 19-year-old Beryl Muddle
later to become his wife in the most
bizarre and literal shotgun wedding of
the year and her 11-week-old baby
boy. Next morning, when detectives
from Liverpool knocked on the door
to arrest him on a charge of car
stealing, Mellish handled a 12-gauge
double-barrelled shotgun and began
dictating to the law. He held the detec-
tives at bay and said he’d shoot Miss
Muddle and the baby if police tried to
arrest him.
Police treated the situation seriously
and called in the riot squad from CIB
headquarters, but it seemed no more
than a routine case in a daily diary of
crime which has hardened many Syd-
ney people to expect the worst. But
no one counted on Mellish holding
out for so long or on the unique
consideration police began extending
to him after Police Commissioner Nor-
man Allan took control of the siege.
Mr. Allan determined to save lives.
He held off his men from storming the
cottage and began assuming an
avuncular role in which few have ever
seen him. He arranged for Mellish to
marry Muddle in the lounge-room of
the cottage, supplied the ring and the
wedding breakfast. At Mellish’s demand
and to the astonishment of the
public and rank-and-file police he
supplied him with a powerful Armalite
carbine and 200 rounds. He chatted
to Mellish by telephone and called in
psychiatrists to validate his handling of
the case.
As the siege neared the end of its
first week, thousands of people began
seeing it as a B-grade crime movie
on the late-late show with Mr. Allan
playing the Regis Toomey part of the
tough police chief with a heart of
gold. Press conferences with the army
of newspaper, radio, and TV reporters
camped at the scene contributed to
the unreality of the drama. After
police had at first blatantly denied
giving Mellish the carbine, truth and
facts almost became a matter of
opinion. “I am an egotist,” said Mr.
Allan at one weekend siege-site Press
conference, “and I believe I have from
top to bottom the wholehearted sup-
port of my men as I would expect.”
But the N.S.W. Police Association
executive was preparing to hold a
special meeting to discuss Mr. Allan’s
handling of the Glenfield affair.
University students, meanwhile, were
still protesting at police “brutality”
during anti-Vietnam demonstrations in
Martin Place last week.
Suburbia
Camaraderie in
Clubland
SYDNEY’S SUBURBAN wilderness
may engender its own kind of angst ,
but it’s also coming up with its own
kind of remedies, effected by that
miracle doctor, the poker machine. The
city planners’ problems have always
been caused by the fact that people
find cities just too attractive to stay
out of them and satellite cities have
always had an uninviting sound of
sterility about them. Yet humanity and
the licensed club, a glass-and-concrete
symbol of a good life available to
everybody, are giving the suburb a
completeness it has lacked before.
Last week, the Cronulla-Caringbah
Leagues’ Club announced plans to build
a sports and club centre to cost $3 mil-
lion (finance is being arranged) a
place in which 20,000 people, in a kind
of mass camaraderie, will be able to
eat together, drink together, gamble,
play squash or bowls, take sauna baths,
exercise in a gymnasium, swim in a
heated swimming-pool, or watch foot-
ball or cricket on three playing fields.
The club began 11 years ago, when
The Cronulla-Caringbah Leagues’ Club
bought the house above ten years ago,
now plans to build the deluxe sports
and club centre below


five men decided it might be a good
idea to form a club to support the
local football team, and started holding
meetings in a room above a chemist’s
shop. Their membership grew, so they
bought an old house on the site of their
present clubhouse, the first storey of
which was built ten years ago. The
top storey was completed six years
later and they hope that the new
centre, to be started early next year,
will be finished in two years.
The club now has 7000 members—
more since the announcement about the
new complex, for people began applying
for membership on the day the news
was released. Yet Cronulla-Caringbah
is already well served by clubs—a
Businessmen’s Club and an RSL Club
with 1600 members are within a few
yards of the Leagues’ Club.
The existing club has facilities for
darts, table-tennis, squash, and golf, but
it seems there is plenty of demand for
the lavishness of sauna-rooms and a
heated swimming-pool.
“We own three blocks of land on this
site and we were going to build there
at first,” the club’s secretary-manager,
Mr. Perc Cheers, said, “but there aren’t
enough parking facilities. Then the
council offered us the land we’re using,
so we bought ten acres and leased the
other 15. We made the decision about
12 months ago.”
The club supports two 'football clubs
—the Cronulla-butherland district team
and a junior club with 29 teams.
“There are a fair few football grounds
in the area,” Mr. Cheers said, “but
they’re not very good.”
Sutherland Shire, well to the south
of Sydney, is developing a regional
identity of its own many of its resi-
dents work in the area, and once this
complex is built they will have even
less reason for going into the city.
Similarly, distance is forcing the
amorphous sprawl of Sydney’s western
suburbs to create its own centres the
vast shopping-developments, Roselands
and Bankstown Square, where a house-
wife’s 20-minute trip to buy groceries
can turn into a large-scale shopping
expedition, culminating in lunch and
a film.
And Bankstown is also planning a
sports complex. Last month, the Banks-
town Sports Club announced a scheme
for an $BOO,OOO centre on a 15-acre site,
with a cricket pitch, athletic track,
seven tennis courts, bowling-greens,
Rugby fields, and a grandstand.
Clubland has its disadvantages, of
course. It may seem as if clubs have
something for everybody, but the odd
man out, it seems, is the teenager
left to search out his own amusements
in a district where recreation is geared
to the middle-aged. On paper, tennis
courts and athletic tracks look as if
they’re catering to the young, but tell
that to the teenager who wants a
discotheque.
Travel
By sea, at discount
THE BRAND NEW Soviet luxury
liner, Shota Rustaveli, due to arrive in
Sydney from Southampton in Novem-
ber, will be the first, but in all prob-
ability not the last, Soviet ship to ply
the Australian route. Current moves in
the fields of both passenger and freight
traffic should at least add further
weight to the increasing demands for
more competitiveness and complaints of
the monopolistic tendencies of the Con-
ference lines.
The Shota Rustaveli was chartered
through the Soviet trade councillor in
London by Mr. Bruce Salmon of the
Charter Travel Club. Captain Fedro-
vitch, a director of the Black Sea
Steamship Company, Odessa, from
which the ship was chartered, is cur-
rently taking a look at Australia. With
him is Mr. V. Zuev from the chartering
division of Marflot. Mr. Zuev’s interests
are in freight. The arrival of the two
Russians follows close on the heels of
Bulgarian shipping representatives with
an eye on the increasing trade between
One of the Soviet liners
Australia and the Eastern European
countries.
What the Eastern Europeans have to
offer is cheaper shipping rates, achieved,
to some extent, through smaller crews
working longer hours for less pay than
would be the case in other major ship-
ping nations. Unofficial sources of in-
formation put, for example, a Polish
seaman on a fifty-hour week for about
SU.S.IOO a month compared with
shorter hours and a wage of $U.5.300
a month in the U.S.
They have achieved some success in
moving into the green Atlantic pastures,
in passenger traffic as well as freight.
But there is plenty of scope for expand-
ing activities and with as many as 536
cargo ships on Soviet Bloc stocks in
1966 there must be plenty of shipping
which could be spared beyond the
boundaries of the Black and Baltic
Seas. Their present push to extend
activity must be expected to continue.
They may be lagging behind in the
more sophisticated fields, such as con-
tainerisation and the current trend to-
ward bigger ships, but the potential of
fairly serious price competition is real
enough.
The price competition is illustrated
by the cheapest fare of $3lO being
offered on the Shota Rustaveli, which
leaves Southampton on its maiden
voyage on October 15. This is some
$l4O less than the nearest price offered
by the Conference lines, and the type
of accommodation is more than com-
parable. There are, for example, no
cabins secreted in the bowels of the
ship and none below the water-line.
And, just as it goes without saying that
tipping is more or less forbidden, there
is no class segregation involved in the
extensive amenities available, either,
and these include six bars, two swim-
ming-pools, a cinema with TV exten-
sions, H & C and air-conditioning in
all cabins, and facilities for all-night
dancing and drinking “two decks
removed from any passenger accom-
modation.”
To tend the 750 passengers there will
be a crew of 400, including 200 “girls
. . . picked for their ability and
charm,” a female purser, two hostesses,
an orchestra, and a band. Anyone who
has travelled on a Soviet ship before
could vouch for the preference Russians
tend to show toward spacious living
quarters and the refreshingly courteous
and friendly service which is usually
available.
The only pleasure passengers will be
expected to forgo for their bargain fare
will be the questionable thrill of calling
in at a long succession of romantically
named ports. It involves considerable
cost saving for the ship, and passengers
from Sydney 40 Southampton will have
to content themselves iwith 'brief calls
at Auckland, Papeete, and Panama
only.
Mr. Salmon, secretary and founder
of the Charter Travel Club, claims
to have broken through the system by
which established shipping lines get
together to fix fares and then take
action to prevent travel agents making
bookings for an.y cut-price operators.
Others have certainly failed in the
effort, including the Holland-America
line on the Australian run.
To overcome the travel - agent
barrier, Mr. Salmon has to operate a
direct marketing system which is run
through offices of the club, both in
London and Sydney. At the most re-
cently available count, applications for
the first voyage include 273 from Eng-
land and 317 from Australia. Mr.
Salmon declines to reveal the sum the
club is paying to charter the ship, but
he will break even with 600 bookings.
What is more, Mr. Salmon claims
that his form of discount ocean travel
between Australia and Britain will
become a regular scheduled service.
After all, “we have chartered a luxury
liner belonging to a steamship company
which the Conference lines would find
somewhat difficult to intimidate should
they feel so tempted.”

OVERSEAS
The two-Chinas issue in the
Japanese ballot box
IN THE campaign for the elections to
Japan’s Upper House on Sunday, China
shared top billing with defence. The
accent on foreign policy was not sur-
prising, for there are few pressing
domestic issues. And the emotional im-
pact of the China question, which is
always great in Japan, is greater now
in the context of a growing sense of
national self-assertiveness and a new
unease about Vietnam.
On the face of it the election issues
were clear-cut enough. The Govern-
ment’s critics argued that China, as a
major power and close neighbor, could
not be ignored. Nor could it be “con-
tained” and isolated by pure force of
arms —certainly not by (a non-nuclear)
Japan. The only sensible policy for
Tokyo, therefore, was one of political
accommodation and trade to blunt the
edges of Maoist militancy. The Social-
ists, Democratic Socialists, the elusively
flexible members of the militant Kom-
eito Buddhist Party (not to mention the
Communists) all advocate diplomatic
recognition of China. They also called
for the repudiation of the Yoshida
letter: the promise given to Chiang Kai
Shek in 1964 that Japan would not
Sato...options open on two-Chinas
trade
allow the Government funds of the
Export-Import Bank to finance major
exports to the mainland.
Mr. Sato’s answers tended to be
more evasive than vigorous. This is
understandable, for a considerable
number of his own Party colleagues
were genuinely convinced that the
critics have a point. Still others were
willing enough to use any stick to lever
Mr. Sato out of the leadership.
No one close to the reins of power
has any illusions about how quickly
Japan can afford to put out feelers to
Peking. Japan’s close political and
economic ties with America and Tai-
wan, and major doubts about China’s
internal stability and its capacity to
adopt a more flexible foreign policy in
the near future, all argue against any
precipitate action.
The economic arithmetic is simple
and compelling. More than 30 percent
of Japan’s exports go to the United
States, against three percent to China.
Japan’s direct private investments in
Taiwan are still relatively small: $192
million at the end of 1966. But more
and more Japanese firms, faced with a
tightening labor market and fast-rising
wages at home, are beginning to look
to the island. And straight trade with
Taiwan last year exceeded trade with
China.
Mr. Sato could risk small deviations:
a decision not to co-sponsor the peren-
nial American resolution in the United
Nations to label the Chinese member-
ship issue as an “important” question
requiring a two-thirds majority; or a
decision to allow export credits to
China through his Export-Import Bank.
He has left his options open at this
level. The Government’s stand on the
United Nations resolution is completely
noncommittal. Its position on the ex-
port credit issue is to argue that the
troublesome Yoshida letter is a strictly
private document and that specific re-
quests for credits for China will be
considered on their merits.
Even the Government’s critics are
doubtful whether China would respond
to Japanese advances. Japan’s total trade
with the mainland dropped by ten per-
cent last year to $557.7 million; it is
expected to fall another ten percent this
year. How much of the drop can be
attributed to China’s economic troubles
and how much to political pique has
been a matter of heated debate,
especially since last winter’s gruelling
and disappointing negotiations to ex-
tend the old Liao-Takasaki trade pact.
But in any case Peking is not expected
to add many juicy orders for complete
plants and other heavy (credit-tied)
equipment to its foreign shopping list
for some time to come.
The political shocks of the cultural
revolution have also cut deeply. Japan-
ese business representatives in Peking
have now been reduced from 90 to less
than 30, and Japanese correspondents
from nine to three. The recent arrest
of the highly respected Peking corres-
pondent of Japan’s most influential
financial journal, the “Nihon Keizai
Shimbun,” shook people in Tokyo.
Fence-sitting may be undramatic
and occasionally undignified. But until
Tokyo can see the shape of a final
settlement in Vietnam, and in China
itself, it is likely to remain firmly
on its perch: trading with both Chinas,
and waiting for its moment to move.
The Presidency
Second to Nixon
WHO WILL be Mr. Richard Nixon’s
running mate? That seems to be the
only mystery left for Republicans now
that Mr. Nixon appears to have his
Party’s nomination for the Presidency
tucked snugly in his pocket. Republican
State organisations in Missouri, Illinois,
Alabama, North Dakota, and Texas
have now voted to support him at the
Party’s national convention in Miami
next month, thereby giving him • on
paper more than enough votes to
be sure of the nomination. The
opinion polls still show that Governor
Rockefeller would be a better choice
if the Republicans actually want to
Nixon...on paper he’s well and
truly home


win in November. But the determin-
ation of Party stalwarts is probably
unshakable and even Mr. Rockefeller
must be secretly calculating whether
or not he should accept the Vice-Presi-
dential nomination, were it offered to
him.
All Vice-Presidential candidates are
chosen primarily for the size of the
dowry that they can bring in the form
of electoral votes. They usually come
from an important State where the
Presidential candidate might otherwise
do poorly. Beyond that, the ideal part-
ner for Mr. Nixon should be able to
attract, as he does not, large numbers
of voters among the young, the liberal,
the Negro, and the urban. Senator
Charles Percy of Illinois fills this des-
cription pretty well. He, and the
equally handsome but older and more
conservative Governor Reagan of Cali-
fornia, are the favorite choices among
Republican Party workers. But a num-
ber of other prominent Republicans
are nursing ambitions to run along
with Mr. Nixon. In Massachusetts, the
Republican delegation is committed to
Mr. Rockefeller but the Republican
Governor, Mr. Volpe, has endorsed Mr.
Nixon. So has, to everyone’s surprise,
Senator Hatfield of Oregon; until now,
as the most prominent Republican
opponent of the war in Vietnam, he
has been a Nixon critic. Mr. Nixon
has his own list of preferences (and he
will do the choosing). On it are said
to be Governors Agnew of Maryland,
Evans of Washington, Love of
Colorado, and Rhodes of Ohio.
Speculation then comes to Mayor
Lindsay of New York. He has the
youth, the glamor, the trust of the
ghettoes, the votes of a big State. All
of these would look even more desir-
able if Senator Edward Kennedy were
to be tempted to run for Vice-President
on the Democratic ticket. Mr. Lindsay
has said that he wants to remain in
New York City, but such disclaimers
mean nothing as the campaign hots
up. But if he or Governor Rockefeller
were to join Mr. Nixon (also now a
New Yorker) on the ticket, a tough and
tedious constitutional question would
arise.
Long ago, when States were fiercely
jealous of each other and politicians,
like the rest of the populace, rarely
changed residence, an amendment to
the Constitution was passed forbidding
a State from giving its electoral vote to
more than one of a Party’s two can-
didates, if they both lived in that
State. Could New York’s electors (the
people who cast ballots in December
on the basis of the popular vote in
November) vote for both Mr. Nixon
and Mr. Lindsay? Could Minnesota’s
electors vote for Mr. Humphrey and
Senator McCarthy, both Minnesotans,
in the unlikely event that the Senator
accepted second place on a Humphrey
ticket? Perhaps the electors could
withhold their votes from the candi-
date for the lesser office, but there too
lies a snag. In a close race, America
might wind up with a President and
a Vice-President from different Parties.
A simple, but cynical, way out might
be to have one of the chosen candidates
move to another State.
Sabah
On the simmer
AS THE Malaysian-Philippines talks
over the Sa'bah claim dragged to the
end of their third largely unproductive
week in Bangkok, what stood out from
the as yet inconclusive exchanges was
the fact that, contrary to expectations,
the Malaysians were willing to do
battle on the legal aspect of the claim.
It had been assumed by many that
this would not be so since it was
equally falsely assumed that in pure
law the Filipinos had the edge. The
retreating colonialists have, after all,
littered the Afro-Asian landscape with
legitimate irredentist issues and
maybe this was one of them. Not so,
say the Malaysians at Bangkok, hav-
ing obviously done a great deal of
legal - historical homework even as
the Filipinos apparently have not done
theirs. Basically, as reported last week,
the Malaysians are querying (to the
extent that the Filipinos will accept any
questioning) whether the Filipino case
can legally rest on the Sultan of Sulu’s
alleged powers in the last century.
The hope, which the Filipinos are try-
ing to frustrate, is to run a coach and
four so completely through the Filipino
case that even the Filipinos are per-
suaded to think again.
The danger for the Malaysians in
this approach would seem to be two-
fold. By revealing the strength of their
case they give the Filipinos a chance
to strengthen theirs but since the
Malaysians have no intention of pro-
ceeding further to the International
Commission of Jurists this scarcely mat-
ters. More important one may wonder
if the Malaysians will gain all that
much from being willing to open the
legal Pandora’s Box, since to do so in-
volves Brunei. Brunei already has
something of a claim on part of Sara-
wak’s Fifth Division where many Brunei
Malays reside, and while the soon-to-
be-crowned Sultan and his still power-
ful father would seem in no need of
an irredentist issue, the possibilitiy of
reawakening Brunei’s dreams of former
greatness might be best avoided.
In any case the Malaysian strong-
point remains its political case in rela-
tion to sovereignty established and
accepted. The Filipino charge of
annexation has no legs to stand on. Not
surprisingly the Filipinos in Bangkok
as far as one can see have also
avoided being too much drawn on the
politics of their claim. In all this the
picture which the Bangkok talks
President Marcus may find the Sabah
claim rebounding against him electorally
clarifies is of the Filipinos finding out
that what passes for truth in the
Manila political hothouse scarcely has
any of that quality for outsiders. Faced
with the fact which they will prob-
ably avoid facing that convincing
themselves on the rightness of an inter-
nal issue is not in the same league as
convincing others, the Filipino response
so far would seem to be neither put up
nor shut up.
Meanwhile, the internal issue of the
Sabah claim simmers on. At root, the
problem for President Marcos is the
Muslim vote in the Sulu area in next
year’s presidential election. Calling a
meeting of the National Bipartisan
Foreign Policy Council on July 7 to
decide whether or not to continue the
talks (it agreed they should) Marcos,
no doubt, hoped thereby to neutralise
ex-President Macapagal and the
Liberal Opposition leaders. They
played it canny and stayed away,
leaving themselves free to attack Mar-
cos and make their own play for the
Muslim vote no matter what happens.
All of which leaves Marcos feeling he
must continue to play it out. While
the talks “continued patiently” the
Philippines Navy and Air Force have
reportedly been put on 24-hour alert
in the southern Philippines.
Malaysia
"Tidak-apathy"
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
in Kuala Lumpur
A FAVORITE Malaysian expression,
“tidak apa” means never mind. The
Malaysians tend to worry only about
problems when the need for more
than worrying has been clearly in-
dicated, unlike their Singapore neigh-
bors, who worry so much they some-


Tun Razak ...“We must not be complacent”
times generate problems that weren’t
there in the first place. True to form,
the inadequacy of border security
arrangements having been clearly
demonstrated by the murder of 15
Malaysian police and the wounding of
18 others in the worst incident since
the Emergency, Kuala Lumpur has set
about putting on a show of doing some-
thing about the Malaysian Communist
Party remnants on the Thai-Malaysian
border.
“We must not be complacent and
we must always be on the alert,” said
Acting Prime Minister Tun Abdul
Razak, announcing greater military
emphasis in what has been a pre-
dominantly police function of
patrolling the Betong Salient area. The
Army Chief of General Staff was
appointed Director of Operations for
West Malaysia there is already a
Director for East Malaysia then
the Malaysians called for a special
meeting of the Thai-Malaysian general
border committee to get some more
specific fast action on the border.
Such action has traditionally been
elusive. The Betong area is 200 miles
or so, as the crows flies, to Kuala Lum-
pur, but between 500 and 600 as it
flies to Bangkok. It is a good deal
longer by rail and road to the Thai
capital, but psychologically it is in the
outer reaches the concept of
“southern Thailand” starts a couple of
hundred miles from Bangkok, and
the predominantly Muslim nature of
the four southernmost provinces makes
them something akin to “foreign parts.”
Not that the Thais would ever pur-
posefully allow those provinces to
legally become foreign. The suspicion
remains that one reason the Thais feel
less worried about MCP leader Chin
Peng than the Malaysians do is be-
cause his MCP presence in southern
Thailand deters the Malaysians from
ever thinking of claiming those
provinces on ethnic grounds.
This is not to say that there has been
no co-operation at all. A joint border
agreement was signed two or three
years ago, but significantly it reduced
the permissible degree of hot pursuit
into each other’s territory from 25
to five miles. A joint intelligence head-
quarters was set up at Songkhla. There
have been numerous committees pro-
ducing verbal co-operation in plenty.
But the outlines of the problem have
remained the same. Chin Peng and his
associates have gone on “integrating”
themselves into southern Thailand life,
secure from the threat of constant
harassment from which they were never
free during the Emergency.
The Malaysians have cleared their
side of the border settlement, while
administering and controlling close to
border movements. On the Thai side,
whatever administration there is
scarcely amounts to control.
Now that the special general border
committee meeting has come and gone,
the outlines of the problem still re-
main the same. Assurances of firm
intent were not lacking, but signs of
meaningful action were. The Malay-
sians no doubt pressed hard, but the
Thais, diplomatically skilled in the art
of giving satisfaction but nothing else,
scarcely gave the impression they were
any more than verbally worried. True,
on returning home the leader of the
Thai delegation talked about there
being “no limit” to the pursuit of ter-
rorists, while adding that “security
forces will probably not go more than
five miles beyond the border.”
The trouble is that, except after the
odd isolated ambush, there are rarely
any “terrorists” to pursue. Likewise,
reports of greater control of supplies
and tenant registration in the Betong
area appear mere windowdressing
when compared with the lack of per-
sonnel to do the job in the first place,
the fact of uncontrolled smuggling of
supplies in the second, and the reality
of the Communists being neither ten-
ants nor in need of supplies since
they grow and sell their own in
the third.
In short, the sustained civilian-
military-developmental approach which
can alone master the situation is not in
the offing. Provided the Malayan
Communist Party remains the Malayan
Communist Party, the problem will re-
main fii southern Thailand and the
concern will be (spasmodically?) felt
in Kuala Lumpur. Conceivably there
is virtue in Chin Peng remaining virtu-
ally unharassed since the ease of life
he now enjoys may inhibit thought of
the rigors of renewed insurgency. How-
ever, one day the heel of Thailand
could turn septic.
Canada
Living with
Trudeau
CANADIANS were settling down last
week to the realisation that with
the dramatic victory of a political
novice, giving them a majority govern-
ment for the first time in six years,
they have entered a new political era,
but without being able to discern where
their young Prime Minister will lead
them. Hence, they are now re-examin-
ing the prospectus which swept 48-
year-old Pierre Elliott Trudeau to
power after only three years as a Mem-
ber of Parliament and only one as a
Cabinet Minister.
The prospect is not made easier
because Mr. Trudeau is still essenti-
ally an unknown quantity with a
capacity, according to Bruce Hutchi-
son, the dean of Canadian political
commentators, “to indicate that he
knows much more than he is will-
ing to say.” Because of this, during
the election campaign policies tended
to take second place in the popular
eye to the aura that surrounded him,
the attitudes that he implicitly repre-
sents, and the sheer charm of his
presence.
“We are for Trudeau,” declared the
largest English-language newspaper in
Montreal during the last week of the
campaign. “Whether we are for the
traditional Liberal Party he leads, we
are not so sure.” Indeed, frequently the
Party’s name took second place to
Trudeau’s own campaign billing and
local candidates ran unashamedly on
his coat-tails.
First, however, there is no doubt
about the new era. The election was,
in the unexaggerated words of the ex-
Conservative Leader, John Diefenbaker,
“a calamitous disaster” for the Con-
servatives.
The Conservatives, who controlled
208 seats out of 265 in 1958, have
dropped from holding 94 to 71 the
Liberal Party under Trudeau now com-
mands 154 out of 264 but what is
more significant, the Party lost its
long stranglehold on the Prairie
provinces, and many of its ablest can-
didates, in the debacle.
In political terms the new era is
marked by the passing of the two chief
representatives of an older Canadian
breed on both sides: the Conservative
Diefenbaker and the old Liberal
Leader himself, Lester Bowles Pearson
the first forcibly by his Party, the
second voluntarily, after a decade of
partisan trench warfare.
When Prime Minister Pearson
retired in April, Trudeau, to his own


initial surprise, was propelled to vic-
tory in the subsequent leadership con-
test by a wave of enthusiasm, variously
described as “Trudeaumania” and
“Trudolatry,” which has yet to abate.
Capitalising on his popularity, Tru-
deau called a snap election, conducted
a fast and glamorous campaign, and
achieved the victory which had eluded
Pearson, the Nobel Peace Prize winner
and eminent diplomat, in ten years
of effort.
The phenomenon is unique in
Canadian political history. Like the late
Senator Robert Kennedy, everywhere
Trudeau is mobbed by the young and
kissed by the girls. To the youthful
and the idealist he symbolises the
future and a new style of politics
without hypocrisy, slick solutions, or
utopian promises. He is a man of the
cities, who campaigned by jet and
spoke to Canadians in the streets and
shopping plazas, and who appealed
successfully to a modern urban people.
In political performance, the basis
for this popularity was what first
brought him into the public eye as
Justice Minister, when he courageously
introduced legislation liberalising laws
on abortion, divorce, and homosexuality
and showed himself the framer of a
Federal constitutional policy.
At the same time he overcame the
reservations of the conservative, the
westerner, and the middle class with
his policies fiscal responsibility, a
strong Federal Government, and a
united Canada. As a University of
Toronto political scientist remarked:
“There is nothing more attractive to
Canadians than to be titillated into
voting for a radical when deep down
they are comforted by the assurance
that he is a conservative.”
In a campaign that was more like a
U.S. Presidential election than any
parliamentary election Canada has yet
experienced, the equally new Conser-
vative Leader, Robert Stanfield a
former provincial Premier from Nova
Scotia was forced to follow suit. A
dour, responsible, and compassionate
man, he offered for the first time in
some years a viable alternative in the
Conservative Party. But, sticking to
conventional campaign methods and
trapped in a vague and misinterpreted
policy on the status of Quebec, he
proved no match for Trudeau. Just as
surely as Trudeau gave Canadians the
option of taking a chance on the future,
Stanfield, whose family business manu-
factures long underwear, implied a
continuation of the past.
In between antics like frugging
with youngsters in the streets or giving
displays in a motel swimming-pool,
in between talking of Mozart and
Saint-Exupery or expanding on the
possibilities of a bicultural nation amid
Montreal’s skyscrapers, Trudeau did
—despite his opponents’ objections—
discuss his policies.
His record and his speeches suggest
Pierre Trudeau...the young mob him,
the girls kiss him
a deep commitment to individual free-
doms. He made his campaign slogan
“the Just Society,” and talked much
of the threats posed not only by racial
and linguistic injustice but by
economic disparities. He favors diplo-
matic recognition of mainland China
and may well be prepared to take
other positions more independent of
U.S. policy. He promises a review of
Canada’s foreign policy, including its
contribution to NATO.
Most important of all in the current
Canadian political context, while fully
committed to the extension of bilin-
gualism and biculturalism, he rejects
any form of special status for Quebec
and, a fluently bilingual French-
Canadian himself, takes a more forth-
right position on a united Canada
than Mr. Pearson, the negotiator, ever
dared to do. A constitutional confron-
tation with the Union Nationale Gov-
ernment of Quebec may well be an
early consequence of his election.
At its best, this election may repre-
sent the new spirit of self-confidence
and adventure that many purported
to be able to recognise in the Canadian
people during the centennial year of
1967, symbolised above all by the
dazzling success of Expo 67. At the
very least, it represents a new gener-
ation in power, and a political experi-
ment which cannot fail to have far-
reaching, if unpredictable, consequences.
New Zealand
Blood of the lamb
GUERILLA WARFARE on New Zea-
land’s industrial front has begun. It is
part of a two-pronged, flexible attack
endorsed by a five-hour closed special
Federation of Labor conference in
Wellington. FOL President Skinner
came through with a free hand to
work for changes in the half-century-
old arbitration system, and with the
strength of the industrial punch at his
side to use in the months of negotiations
ahead. These are aimed to get the
workers a five percent award increase
and a remoulding of the general wage
order system.
Employers are under pressure to
mark their portals with the blood of the
lamb to prevent the affliction which is
plaguing New Zealand Breweries. NZB
have a strike on their hands by drivers
who may follow a tactic of returning to
work while another key trade cripples
production.
Unity is strong, with the unions
pledged to fight across the floor for
their increases or to use the collective
resources of the FOL to win them to-
gether. Structural changes from trade
to industrial unions could now occur.
Another healthy development may come
in the FOL central offices, where extra
advocates will be needed. Labor rela-
tions specialist F. J. L. Young said on
the NZBC’s alert current affairs pro-
gram “Checkpoint” that N.Z. union
bargaining was as good as any in the
world but more money and research
were required by unions. If the FOL
don’t employ additional research staff
they will at least keep some national
executive members full - time on ad-
vocacy.
The Employers’ Federation is co-
operating with Labor Minister T. P.
Shand’s efforts to bring them into dis-
cussions with the co-operative FOL.
But the employers are facing consensus
problems and have kept published
statements to a minimum. A Monday
joint employers - FOL meeting was
called for eleventh-hour compromises,
but this week is still likely to see the
collective bargaining continue while
the special meeting does little more
than set the stage for the future.
The vigorous Shand is using initiative
in trying to keep industrial peace but
has a farmer-dominated National Party
Caucus on his hands, unwilling to give
an inch in case it is read as weakness.
Shand returned from Sweden last
weekend to inherit the situation and
initially urged greater emphasis on
bargaining in productivity, followed
this with a commendation for social
ferment and an advocacy of Swedish
labor-market policies. Implementation
of such advances seems unlikely as FOL
leaders pass over their own in-
adequacies and assert the employers are
not capable of working with it.
In the midst of the ferment an em-
barrassing parliamentary report was
tabled by an independent commission
urging much-needed salary increases
for MPs. Caution may advise Par-
liament against granting themselves a
7.5 percent increase while the workers
protest about the Arbitration Court.
The winter of industrial discontent
could flush a sluggish industrial scene
out and provide a healthy legacy so
long as strategic unions, such as the
freezing workers, don’t let their power
run to their head, cripple meat ex-
ports, and hold the country to a
ransom it cannot afford.

Each year Qantas selects 50 young men of good education and
good health for the Qantas Cadet Pilot Training Scheme —a programme
of training and practical flying to lead them to a Boeing 707 command,
and later through to the $20,000,000 super-jets of the 70’s.
As a Cadet your son would be given a basic training course worth $13,000 at a
cost to you of $5OO, and a further $90,000 would be spent by Qantas on
his training until he achieves a Boeing command. Qantas pilots are career pilots in
one of the fastest growing industries in the world. Promotion through to
command is automatic (subject to vacancies and maintaining proficiency). Above-
average salary in a secure profession is open to young men who are
capable and prepared for a life of study, training and practical application to keep
them at the peak of proficiency. They can anticipate flying up to the age of
55 and retiring with a superannuation payment in the vicinity of $lOO,OOO.
Applicants for the Qantas Cadet Pilot Training Scheme must be
under 22 (under 24 with tertiary education) and attempting
or have passed a Matriculation, including
Mathematics, Science (Physics) and English.
ftQ77R. 107.78 NAT


Accounting for the ABC
THERE’S A STORY circulating around
the fringes of the lobbies in Canberra
that the Parliamentary Public Accounts
Committee’s inquiry into the financial
administration of the Australian Broad-
casting Commission is costing the ABC
enough in administrative effort to pay
for 52 episodes of “Let’s Find Out.”
The truth that motivates the cynicism
comes from the fact that the ABC is
having to order a substantial amount
of research, back through its cobwebs
and pigeonholes, simply to answer some
of the committee’s questions.
Just how much the committee, on
behalf of us all, doesn’t know about the
ABC can be judged by its far-reaching,
and sometimes randomly divergent,
curiosity. At the first sitting of the
inquiry in April, one of the early ques-
tions lobbed at the Commission’s wit-
nesses dealt with the establishment of
wireless broadcasting in Australia in
1922—ten years before the ABC came
into being. The ABC hierarchy at the
witness table was said to have been
momentarily appalled at the prospect
of having to firing the committee up
to date on history and was relieved
when the questioning became more
topical.
But witnesses still were frequently
stumped for ready answers to such
requests as “Would you be able to
supply details of your repairs and main-
tenance expenditure on studios each
year since 1957-58?” Responses began
to assume a pattern: “I do not have
the figures (or facts) in mind, but we
will supply them.” One imagines that
at the distant end of the ABC’s chain
of command teams of clerks will be
kept busy for months.
The significance behind the foggy
groping for facts and figures is that
the Australian Broadcasting Commission
—a broadcasting giant powered by a
budget now exceeding $4O million a
year; a publisher, concert entrepreneur,
international wattle-waver, and nation-
ally the most intrusive influence in the
mass-media business—is under formal
inquiry for the first time since it began
operating in June, 1932. In 36 years it
has burgeoned from a crystal-set
fascinator with simple and fairly clearly
defined goals into a complex sprawl of
sub-industries which don’t readily make
up into a comfortable whole and don’t
encourage sympathetic understanding
because of tbe very complexity of the
conflicting parts.
The ABC is part Public Service and
part Pepsi generation; part communi-
cator, entertainer, and the nation’s cul-
tural rib-cage; part national vehicle,
part independent operator; part mouth-
piece for any windy politician who
catches the Speaker’s eye at Question
Time, and part outlet for the respon-
sibly intelligent tongue. With such a
fragmentation of identity tags it’s no
wonder that its corporate image is a
mess and its purpose confused and
misunderstood.
Paradoxically, the ABC’s most suc-
cessful exercise in public relations in
recent years has been to try to destroy
the only familiar identity the organisa-
tion has ever had without offering a
single compatible substitute. By dis-
couraging us from thinking, talking,
and writing about it as “Aunty” (and
having us believe that it is really a
madly mod young thing in a mini-
skirt), the ABC has done nothing more
than reveal three uncertain legs under
a shortened hemline. The idea that we
couldn’t accept an “Aunty” sprinting
for the line in the radio and TV ratings
race 'has brought the ABC out in a
rash of bogus imagery, just to get us
to accept programs which its English
relative, “Aunty” BBC, has been
originating for years without worrying
about what the world thought about
the length of its skirt.
The ABC’s selfconsciousness was mis-
placed. There was nothing wrong or
harmful in the loose and popular use
of the sobriquet, only in the inhibitive
thinking, within the ABC, which
allowed it to harden arteries. “Aunty”
was more a token of steady reliability—
quality, if you like—than an epithet of
ridicule, and by trying to get rid of it
the ABC’s publicists have made the
common mistake of imagining that only
youth is modern and that only
modernity matters. Whatever its alias is
now, the ABC’s home is just an over-
crowded institution.
It is only comparatively recently that
the ABC has begun worrying about its
public image in such personal terms.
From its birth its preoccupying problem
has been its national development on
year-to-year financing.
As public works, the establishment
of first its radio and then its television
networks has been intermittently frus-
trated by World War 11, post-war
economics, and competitive priorities.
The responsibilities which it has
assumed and had thrust on it, year by
year, have so added to its complicated
administration that members of the
Parliamentary Public Accounts Com-
mittee must have wondered where to
start advising, where to start admonish-
ing—or even simply where to start
looking.
With its principal function as a com-
municator, the ABC is only just able to
participate in the communications revo-
lution. Its establishment work in radio
was still incomplete when it had to
begin proliferating television signals;
20 FACES OF THE ABC
THE Australian Broadcasting Commission has many faces
and many “homes” for every face. Throughout Australia, the
ABC is in tenanted and temporary buildings, old buildings
and new buildings, but not many buildings of its own. In
Sydney alone it sprawls through these 20 addresses in
scattered parts of the city:
Standard Building, William Street
(news and program production)
Left: Gilbert Building, Kings
Cross (news and programs)
Above: Masonic Hall, Taylor
Square (rehearsal studios)
Right: Television studios,
Gore Hill (being extended)
Pathfinders Building,
Gore Hill (engineers)


By DENIS O'BRIEN
its ground-level work in television was
still being thwarted by inadequate facili-
ties when it felt compelled to reach for
the costly benefits of satellite telecasting
without the ready money to pay for
them. With instantaneous global tele-
casting now possible, the temptations
to dial into “live” history are great.
After yielding twice recently within a
month, an ABC official confided, “We’ll
worry about paying after we’ve got the
■bill.”
Very roughly the current cost of
bringing a satellite signal to Australia
from, say, the United States is $lO,OOO
an hour. Assuming that satellite tele-
casts are to become a routine (even
if diminishingly expensive) part of
ABC-TV programming, the Federal
Government will have to make an addi-
tional appropriation to cover the cost
unless other ABC functions and require-
ments are to be short-changed.
On its own admission in evidence
before the inquiry, the ABC has always
been behind in its planning for reasons,
» says, which are partly historical in
relation to the industry and partly due
to circumstances forced on it.
In the pre-war years its studio plans
almost invariably were obsolete before
they could be implemented. The tech-
nology of a quickly expanding industry
was outpacing the Public Service vision
and financial thinking of the time. As
a result, the ABC was forced to make
do, accepting temporary accommoda-
tion under circumstances which quickly
became permanent and leasing studios
instead of building them. After the war
it submitted plans for major studio pro-
jects in Sydney, Adelaide, and Perth,
but they were rejected because of lack
of funds, materials, and labor. It went
into the 1950 s with its major plans for
accommodation and improvement of its
radio facilities still largely unrealised.
And then came television.
Since 1954- nearly all the ABC’s
available money for works has been
spent on television. Only now, with
enough of its television commitments
satisfied to ease the strain on its
resources, is it looking with positive
concern at the disturbing state and
sprawl of its housing of radio.
Perth is the only capital where the
ABC is satisfactorily accommodated.
There it has an integrated radio-TV
complex which it looks on as a model
ideally suited to service the smaller
capitals and which. it hopes to have
duplicated in Adelaide. The scattering
of ABC offices and studios in Adelaide
typifies the growth pioblem which has
almost overwhelmed the organisation
an d which contributes to its national
rent bill of almost $750,000 a year.
Some ABC staffers refer to their penods
of rellef duty m Adelaide as doing a
coronary because of the physical dis-
Melbourne isn't much
more comforta;bl accommodated . One
studio feedi , hc network was con .
verted from a church hall in 1942;
many , 0 f the other stu dios are being
taken out of commission one by one
to j-, e rewired. If they have to be used
much longer they will have to be
rewired again.
j n Sydney, the situation is night-
marish. ABC radio, TV, and adminis-
trative personnel are spread through
22 different buildings, one of
them built in 1847. The Commission’s
Sydney publicity staff has had three
addresses in as many years and is
even now on ly temporarily accom-
modated. The real-estate developer
who quipped that in almost every
other new high-rise office block in
Sydney you’ll find a Cahill’s restaurant
in the basement and an ABC depart-
ment on the fourth floor was only
exaggerating to prove a point,
The Commonwealth Department of
Works carries the ABC’s vote for
capital works, but doesn’t extend it
much of the flexible treatment which
the sophisticated nature of its industry
calls for. In general, the department
regards the ABC as just another Pub-
lie Service client and finds it difficult
to provide, within the system, for its
special requirements,
Something of the difficulty which
this imposes on the ABC was revealed
during a session of the inquiry by the
Commission’s assistant general mana-
ger) Mr> W . S . Hamilton. The chair-
man of the Parliamentary Public
Accounts Committee, Mr. Alan
Cleaver, a Liberal Member from
Perth, had asked Mr. Hamilton if the
Commission had suffered delays under
the system and if it had sometimes
looked longingly at a private contract
<° get what i, wanted. .
. Mr. Hamilton s reply was significantly
interesting enough to quote at length:
“The system under which we work
inevitably presents us with great prob-
lems. I wish to make it clear at the
outset that I would not wish to reflect
in any way on the Department of
Works; we have had much evidence of
the goodwill of that department to
help us in every possible way, to co-
operate with us and to meet our dead-
lines in so far as it can.
“But we are aware that we are one
of the many clients of the Department
of Works, which has an enormous job
to do all over Australia. In particular,
we are a specialised client which has
very specialised problems in which we
feel we are rather more expert,
“The system under which the

Department of Works operates is essen-
tially a rather inflexible system. Maybe
it has to be. But an inflexibility of this
kind, when it can take many years
from planning to completion, is not
completely suitable for the broadcasting
industry, which is changing techno-
logically from day to day. Our pro-
gramming is changing so much that
the kind of inflexibility which is
imposed by the Department of Works’
system makes it difficult for us to
operate easily and conveniently.”
Mr. Hamilton detailed one example
of a critical area—soundproofing and
acoustics—where the ABC’s tolerance
of the relationship obviously is strained.
“We have great expertise in sound-
proofing and acoustics,” he said. “No
doubt the Department of Works
acquires a similar expertise from an
exchange of ideas with our officers.
But while our officers remain, the
officers of the Department inevitably
get promoted elsewhere and we have
to start all over again.”
The thought of the ABC grabbing
satellite programs and punching out
‘ Now Time” with one hand and writ-
ing urgent interdepartmental memos
for studio soundproofing with the other
is promisingly funny, but also a fairly
accurate example of the incipient hell
behind its heavenly corporate symbol.
The Com'mission’s annual report to
Parliament brings its multiplicity of
endeavors cosily together in an attrac-
tively illustrated booklet. Summaries
of the programming pumped through its
73 medium-wave radio stations, 39 tele-
vision stations, nine TV translator ser-
vices, ten domestic short-wave services,
and its four Radio Australia trans-
mitters present an impressive picture of
calm administrative accomplishment
and easily tapped creativity. It is only
when one attempts to dissect the
balance sheet that the comparatively
chaotic structure of the ABC begins to
show.
There is no readily apparent division
of radio and television operational ex-
penses; no clue to the 'miracle of
accounting that provides one budget
for the “Argonauts’ Club” and another
for “Survey”; nothing to show who
grabs first and where to meet the top-
ical expenses for the radio current-
affairs show “AM,” and television’s
“This Day Tonight.” Television
obviously gets the bulk of the available
money, but no system seems to exist to
give a reasonably accurate breakdown
of general TV program expenses. The
ABC is only now working toward the
day when individual programs get in-
dividually costed budgets.
If the ABC is to stay running in the
accelerating communications business,
if it is to continue to satisfy its strange
urge to compete with co'mmercial
operators and satisfy its faithful
minorities, and if it is to continue to
cling to its dubious role as the mono-
polist promoter of orchestral concerts,
then its clamor for a radically different
system of financing must be imminent.
That is an alert to an inevitability,
not an encourage'ment for a game of
grabs. By the accidents of evolution
and the designs of ambition, the ABC
has developed into an expensive
empire within an empirical industry.
It can’t be allowed to play the open-
end game with the privileges of public
money, yet it can hardly continue to be
supported by a financial policy which
doesn t account for the sudden cost of
looking at history “live” by satellite.
I believe the ABC is about to seek a
variation of its system of financing—
one which will, at least, allow it to be
freer in its forward planning.
The fact that the ABC hasn’t made
much of a public noise about its 'mount-
ing developmental problems is one of
its curious characteristics. It is ever-
ready to carry news and information
about others, very reticent to talk about
itself. A lot of the eager Press vigilance
over the ABC is due, I think, as much
to suspicions about what’s going on
behind the bland facade as to its overt
blunders and frailties. One of the few
occasions the Commission has actively
courted the Press in recent years was
during the bitter wrangle for the
primary tenancy of the main hall in the
Sydney Opera House. Reducing the
dispute to essentials, the Elizabethan «
Trust and associated supporters wanted
the hall constructed for opera, the ABC
wanted it for orchestral concerts. Sud-
denly, ABC executives began taking
newspapermen into their confidence.
Not much was revealed that hadn’t been
guessed at, but ABC men were un-
commonly frank. They won the battle,
but it broke up the conspiracy that had
lorded over Australian cultural activi-
ties for years.
Since then the shutters have come
down again. Access to executives of the
Commission is possible, but not easy.
Unless they are meeting the Press to
promote programs they say little, even
though they might talk a lot.
Provisions of the Secrets Act, by
which all ABC employees are bound,
often seem to be used to keep the
public at bay rather than to prevent
the leakage of unauthorised informa-
tion. Ultimately, and not unnaturally,
the persistent seeker of ABC facts is
referred to the general manager’s office.
Mr. .Talbot Duckmanton, the present
incumbent, is now often too busy to
dispense them personally and they are
handled by his Press aide, Mr. Stuart
Revill, a very capable journalist with
a disarming manner. Like most public-
relations screens —whether they be
necessary or not —rather too much gets
lost in the filter.
Even when tempted into frankness
by sympathetic questioning at the
Public Accounts inquiry, ABC wit-
nesses have shown a marked reluctance
to complain or protest at the difficulties
of their uneasy membership of the
bureaucracy. Time and again, witnesses
have been quick to burst a rising
pimple of dissatisfaction by \ patting
another member of the bureaucratic
brotherhood on the back with an
acknowledgement of past help and
present sincerity.
“Grin and bear it” might almost be
the ABC’s unwritten motto, certainly
among its upper echelons. For a typical
example of its clenched-teeth smile,
consider this gem from Dr. J. R.
Darling in his 1966-67 annual report,
his last as chairman:
“The Commission expects and re-
ceives criticism of its operations poli-
tically from all sides, each of which
considers that its point of view is inade-
quately represented; from those who
ask for more light entertainment and,
on the other hand, from those who
consider that programs should never
fall below a level of taste that appeals
to them; from those who want still
more sport and those who think sport
a gross intrusion on program time, and
indeed from every group in the country
which has a special interest or taste
which it considers that the ABC is
there to satisfy.
“Such criticism is a good thing and
is welcomed by us as a sign, not only of
interest but of the fact that so much

is expected of us. We believe a proper
balance has been preserved and con-
siderable progress achieved, though we
know that we cannot please everybody
all the time.”
One is reminded of the Boy Scout
who risks his life to help a little old
lady across the road only to be abused
by her because she wanted to stay on
the other side. The constant effort to
regard criticism as a “good thing”
sometimes cracks the ABC’s public front
of Rotarian bonhomie but never
demolishes it. In a crisis, the boys stand
together and all’s well with the lower-
case establishment.
But the brave smile doesn’t always
last after the front door has been
closed. Mr. Duckmanton isn’t so remote
from his staff as not to be able to blast
them with a few fierce rockets. Inter-
viewer Robert Moore is said to have
felt the heat after he made a few care-
less comments coincidental with his
resignation as executive producer of
“Four Corners” several months ago.
At a time when the ABC was backing
him for an American Harkness Fellow-
ship his remarks about the limitations
of “Four Corners” weren’t appreciated
on the 12th floor of Broadcast House
in Elizabeth Street, Sydney.
Public-affairs programming is the
most sensitive of all the ABC’s limbs,
also the prime indicator of its propen-
sity for pace-setting in television. By
their easy assumption of the liberal
cause, programmers have forged out
into hazardous areas of fact and opinion
where other statutory authorities rarely
dare to tread. The forging has made
the ABC more politically vulnerable
than even Dr. Darling implied in his
“criticism is good” remarks. The ABC
isn’t the voice of government, but its
sometimes rather dubious use of its
semi-autonomy does not help its cause
with governments which have to foot
its bills.
The trouble with the sturdy defence
of the ABC’s free-ranging sweep
through public affairs is that anyone
who offers the mildest rebuke to its
occasional naivete and errors of judg-
ment is randomly categorised as a
reactionary, a conservative, a fascist, or
an old-fashioned fool—not by the ABC
itself but by the clusters around it who
often make rather careless equations
with democracy and freedom of speech.
Maintaining a balanced viewpoint in
its public-affairs programs is, as Mr.
Duckmanton himself recently admitted,
a very real problem. He told the Public
Accounts inquiry: “I have made it clear
that no one in the organisation who is
working in the sensitive area of current
affairs can be led publicly to espouse
causes. This, again, is a difficult area to
administer. But what it means is that
if he chooses to do so in exercising his
rights as a citizen, then he is placed in
our organisation where his talents can
be used, but not, perhaps, in the current-
affairs area. There it would be very
difficult for the public looking at the
program to accept him as being im-
partial and being able to divorce his
viewpoint from the cause with which
the public knows he has publicly asso-
ciated himself.”
For all its prickly sensitivities and its
awkward mixture of bureaucratic atti-
tudes and commercial competitiveness,
the ABC is not regarded as a difficult
employer. It sustains roughly 5500
employees, the bulk of whom, it claims,
are engaged in production. Yet some of
the talent it attracts thinks it is more
concerned with administrative
machinery than with the creative people
it employs.
Author Tony Morphett, who was a
full-time ABC employee before he left
to take up a Commonwealth Literary
Fund grant, tells a story about a friend
of his who rang a man in the adminis-
trative section of the ABC.
“They’d got into holts over some-
thing,” says Morphett, “and finally my
friend, who is a program-maker, said,
‘What you don’t seem to realise is that
we’re in business to put noises and pic-
tures into those little boxes in people’s
lounge-rooms.’ And the man in adminis-
tration drew in his breath and said, ‘I
think that’s a very narrow view to take
of things.’ ”
One of the ABC’s top TV program
executives recently was summoned to
Broadcast House for an informal sound-
ing out of his long-term plans. When
he left he was perplexed by the dis-
covery that the organisation put a
higher value on administration than the
programs which helped to sustain it.
He had been made to feel that he was
simply marking time as a programmer.
This administrative caste system
operates most evidently in ABC radio,
where progress comes painfully and the
newcomer can spend his first few
months trying to find his way through
the memos in his mail pigeonhole.
Despite all of Mr. Duckmanton’s
attempts to enliven national radio it
remains inhibited by its obligations.
The complicated network procedures
make long-term planning of any major
radio production awesomely difficult.
The First Network is loosely regarded
as the vehicle for light entertainment,
but its schedules are constantly being
upset now that it has to carry parlia-
mentary broadcasts. The Second Net-
work is supposed to succor most of
the minority groups with serious pro-
grams, and the slightest threat to its
output of recorded orchestral music to
accommodate overcrowding on the First
Network draws blistering letters from
just about every retired academic and
“Indignant Listener” in the land. The
Third Network services regional stations
with such rural essentials as market
reports, meticulously detailed weather
reports, and long (and strangely
hypnotic) recitals of river heights. But
the Third takes so many splits from
the First and Second that it often
sounds to be an odd-job of a network
and the car radio listener, speeding
home to the metropolis, can become
quite punch-drunk from the mixture.
The apparent effect of such tangled
responsibilities is to cause ABC radio
administrators to throw their smocks
over their heads and opt out of the
race. Any creative white heat in ABC
radio is subtly cooled by men who have
grown white hairs trying to run the
obstacle course. Most of the ABC’s
1930 s traditions, manners, and disci-
plines are to be found in its radio
warrens, where there is a comparative
calm, and men call each other “old
boy,” and where programs are more
important than personalities, and where
the voice of' John Chance remains the
touchstone of ABC pronunciation and
enunciation.
The languor is often beguiling,
though. The purposeful listener, plot-
ting his way through programs with the
help of a strangely old-fashioned publi-
cation called “Radio Guide,” frequently
can find more to enrich, inform, and
entertain him in a week than in a month
of highly touted ABC-TV programs,
which are really only meaningful mile-
stones through routinely commercial
acres of dross.

a common practice for ABC men to
call female staff by their first names
from the first meeting on (“It’s our
way of feminising a predominantly
masculine organisation,” says a Broad-
cast House man with flippant logic), but
in ABC-TV women are in a “darling”
world of showbiz—and John Chance is
another scene.
Personnel associated with TV news
and public affairs wear a manner of
confident superiority (often only mar-
ginally justified) and usually can be
counted on to win any scramble with
light entertainment for funds and facili-
ties. Mostly, the current image of ABC
television is being sustained by the suc-
cess of “This Day Tonight,” into which
unprecedented promotional resources
are still being poured and which, among
the lower echelons of the ABC, is re-
garded as being inviolate to criticism or
correction. Any outsider who dares to
question any aspect of “TDT” is
marked as a bigot or a “tool of com-
mercialism,” as I personally found after
recently reviewing the program in its
second year of life.
Although its content of Australian
programs is at a healthy level (46.4
percent at the last accounting), ABC-
TV s balance of trade with overseas
film and program exchanges puts it in
debt For instance, the ABC is the
BBC’s biggest customer in Australia
and bought the majority of the 1342
BBC films sold to Australia in the past
12 months. In return, the ABC had only
five of its TV programs exposed in
Britain during the year ended June 30—
the documentaries “Living Fossils,”
“Looking at Australia: Sugar,” and
something called “The Racing Com-
bination,” a folksong program with the
catch-penny title of “Waltzing Matilda,”
and the series called “Wandjina.” In
all, the ABC only sold about 30 of its
programs overseas during the year,
most of them documentary shorts. Eire
was the biggest purchaser, followed by
Malaysia and New Zealand. Ghana and
Hong Kong each bought one: the junior
space fiction serial “The Stranger.”
But flying Australian television’s flag
abroad is only another responsibility
which has been casually invested in the
ABC. It has still yet to answer many of
its moral obligations to viewers at home.
After more than ten years of effort and
expenditure it is still only comparatively
tentative in its consistent production of
drama and hasn’t put down anything
memorable in light entertainment.
After 36 years the Australian Broad-
casting Commission still has an air of
impermanency around its edges. As it
grows bigger it seems to grow slightly
more harassed. Sometimes it seems like
a giant and uneasy construction of
children’s building-blocks ready to
crumble on a sudden jolt.
A Broadcast House man said to me
recently: “The first thing you’ve got
to accept is that the ABC is necessary.”
Maybe. But put that way it sounds like
that despairing .cry “The show must
go on.”


What is an Arts
degree worth?
By APRIL HERSEY
THERE IS A SORT of international
chain letter which passes from Appoint-
ments Board to Appointments Board in
universities from Glasgow to Paris to
Hong Kong to Africa asking plain-
tively in every language: “What do you
do with your Arts graduates?”
Nobody has an answer. Every year
more and more Arts graduates, capped
and gowned for the occasion, move
across the rostrums of the world,
receive their scrolls, hold the centre
stage just for a moment of time before
they proceed on to w'hat in many cases
could be described as the limbo of
educated boredom.
The demand for degrees reached a
new peak in the immediate postwar
years. Australian universities were
strained to breaking point. Building
programs of feverish intensity pro-
vided a steady background sound to
the flutter of pages as new universities
took shape. Students merged into a
blurred mass of fact-absorbing
humanity, crowding the campuses,
jamming the lecture halls, waiting in
line to use equipment.
Where are they now the earnest
graduates of the busy ’fifties? Only a
minute percentage have found them-
selves employment in the areas where
they so confidently expected to find it.
And it will be the same for the
graduates of 1968.
“When people come in here and
tell me they want to be creative,” a
harassed student counsellor said, “I
always feel like screaming. But I calm
down and ask them what they want
to create and no one seems to know.”
Appointments Board counsellors at
the universities find themselves having
to prick egos. “We do try to let people
down gently,” one woman said. “But
really there isn’t any way to make it
easy for someone who has been drifting
along imagining that at the end of it
all will be the pot of gold, when they
have to realise that the openings avail-
able are very limited.”
The jobs that the graduates see
themselves gracing are usually in broad-
casting, television, the diplomatic corps,
advertising, and journalism. Of the 882
Arts graduates from Sydney University
in 1967, 12 entered these professions.
Mrs. P. Geidans, of the Appoint-
ments Board of Sydney University,
said: “Arts degrees are our major
problem. Particularly the women
graduates. The girl who is limping
or for that matter sailing through her
course will eventually come up against
the moment of truth when she has to
know what she intends to do. A real
decision eventually has to be made and
six out of ten women finally turn to
teaching.’'’
Whether the dissatisfied Arts graduate
who is forced to turn to teaching makes
a good teacher is open to question.
Often he is in the onerous position of
having a degree not needed in industry
and too good for the classroom. He
drifts in an unhappy fashion into a
field which requires dedication and some
sense of vocation. If he lacks this he
is not good enough to be a teacher, and
yet very often the Arts graduate may
have a degree of a higher calibre than,
say, a science teacher. A Science gradu-
ate who drifts into teachihg without
really wanting to be there must have
very ordinary qualifications indeed if he
hasn’t been able to find anything at all
to do in industry. Real teachers who
have planned their lives to reach the
heights when they take their first class
need not become furious at these state-
ments —they are naturally exempt from
criticism.
But there is a definite sense of the
ridiculous in a situation in which the
teachers who have failed to achieve
their original ambitions pour their hopes
over the next generation and send on
another crop of young hopefuls to take
Graph showing the rapid rise in the
number of graduates of Arts from Syd-
ney University compared with graduates
in Science, Medicine, Engineering, and
Economics
degrees in Arts, most of whom in turn
will become teachers and influence the
next group of dreamers.
The multiplication of Arts graduates
is reaching interesting proportions. In
the last decade at Sydney University
the Faculty of Arts has seen its students
quadruple. On a recent graph pro-
duced at the university plotting the
path of Medicine, Science, Engineering,
Economics, and Arts, Science has taken
a slight downward turn, but Arts, shown
as a dotted line, floats away from the
other three up and away.
A large percentage of the Arts
students are women. Something like 60
percent were women last year at Sydney
University and this year even more
have crowded the lecture halls. About
20 percent of the entire body bf gradu-
ating students are women graduating in
Arts.
“They are all so confident that they
are doing the right thing,” one coun-
sellor said. “It’s like a terrible hoax.
Some devoted teacher has spent years
advising them to study Arts and then
everything wonderful will open up to
them. It’s made to sound so glamorous.
The little voices of doubt are rarely
heard and hardly ever heeded. We do
try to get them to take one subject
which may be useful—psychology or
statistics—we advise them right at the
beginning. The sad thing is that the
Arts course is purely educational and
not vocational. It’s only an additional
discipline for the mind, a rather graceful
flourish.”
A breakdown of figures on the 1967
Sydney crop showed a remarkable
diversity of activities when the chips
went down.

Though almost 50 percent went into
teaching, some finished .up in retail
stores or processing computers or doing
market research. Girls who had econo-
mics infiltrated the stock-market area
and went to work for chartered
accountants, though possibly there is a
great deal of poetry being written in
the margins of the scrip and on the
back pages of ledgers.
Some graduates may be writing books
by computer, too, since this is one field
in which even the Arts graduate is
beginning to find a place, a situation
which will continue if an automatic
computing course is established as a
second-year subject at Sydney Uni-
versity.
Both the universities and the indus-
trialists are looking extremely hard at
each other these days. The usual student
visits to places such as government,
semi-government organisations, and
private firms are commonplace; at
universities thousands of interviews
take place at the Appointments Board
between final-year students and per-
sonnel managers from- business organ-
isations. Communication is extremely
difficult and often dissolves into silence
when Arts graduates face up to the
commercial world. In all, less than a
quarter of students are reached this
way.
At Monash University last month
there was a confrontation at a seminar
on “the relation between universities
and industry.”
Among the representatives of industry
was Mr. P. J. Derhan, general manager
of Nylex Corporation Limited, bravely
taking on some of his old professors.
Buoyed up by the fact that the plastics
industry between now and the year
2000 on a world basis will require If
billion tons of raw material, be seven
times larger than the aluminium in-
dustry, 39 times the size of the rubber
industry, and will double in size every
5£ years, he pleaded with the university
to start gearing some courses directly
toward the plastics industry. Many of
his graduates, he said, had apparently
suffered from lack of practical experi-
ence and all of them felt they should
have been instructed in the use of the
computer and its applications.
His main interest was to obtain
engineers, scientists, and economists,
but he did rather wistfully note that at
Stirling, in Scotland, a more flexible
type of degree structure was allowing
Arts students to read basic science and
industrial science.
Sir Alan Westerman, secretary of the
Department of Trade, also spoke at the
Monash seminar suggesting purely voca-
tional universities. “I believe that there
is clear evidence that in the minds of
the community and the students the role
of the university should be vocational.
Vocational in the individual sense —to
supply a student with training for a
profession. Vocational also in the
broader sense—to enable achievement
of as high levels of economic and social
development as its skilled, intelligent
people can contrive in a competitive
world.”
He suggested a market-research pro-
gram aimed at finding what kind of a
graduate should be produced to fill
what position in the world of industry
and commerce.
“Not only am I sure that industry
and the educational institutions must
survey the market for the human pro-
duct. I am positive that very little, as
yet, has been done and very little infor-
mation gathered.”
After listening to the voice of indus-
try with what must surely have been
some impatience, Dr. J. A. L. Matheson,
Vice-Chancellor of Monash, told the
seminar that “not only the speakers but
half the audience don’t know what
universities are all about and I propose
to tell them.”
“The universities do not exist for the
purpose of producing cannon-fodder for
industry,” he said. “We have responsi-
bility for education over a wide range
of human activity, but if universities
are not generators of ideas, generators
of a sense of values, in some respects
even the conscience of society, the
society will be so much the poorer, and
if we narrow our vision too much into
a particular area which needs trained
people, then to that extent we shall
have deprived society of something
which we might have given them. This
is not to say that in each area we are
trying to cover we shouldn’t do the
best we can, but there is more to it than
just a 1:1 correlation between a
graduate and his first job. All this is
not easy to accomplish.
“We’ve also got to recognise the fact
of life that people move from one job
to another. One is not producing a can
of beer or whatever it may be; one is
producing a human being who moves
out into life and begins to develop and
flower according to the opportunities
that come before him, and if we have
not given him some sort of solid basis
from which he can develop into what-
ever opportunities life should put in
front of him, then in the universities we
have failed in our purpose. I would say
from this point of view it is quite im-
possible to contemplate trying to match
people with jobs; specific training for
jobs is just not our business. We are
concerned to produce intelligent people
who can think so that when you get
them, if you know what you are doing,
you can make the best use of them.
There is really only a rough relationship
between the course that students pursue
at universities and the career they subse-
quently follow.”
Dr. Matheson said that he felt the
standards of first degrees had become
too high in Australia. “Our first degrees
have got out of hand, and I think w'e
should reduce both the content and
standard . . . because, in fact, we ask
too much of the average student and I
would like to see a recognition in the
universities that the B.A. and B.Sc.
don’t need to go, perhaps, quite so far
as we now seem to think.” He suggested
aiming the course at the average and
even slightly below-average student and
developing postgraduate courses.
“We do not have any problems with
Arts graduates who go on to further
study,” a student counsellor said. “If
they take a library course, or their
Dip. Ed., or whatever they feel will
help them they are already halfway
toward solving their problem. They
become specialists.”
In 1967, at Sydney University, 776
graduates (34 percent of the total)
proceeded on to fulltime further
academic study. Arts (447) and Science
(267) accounted for 92 percent of those
going on. Fifty percent of all graduates
proceeding with their studies planned
to study for a Diploma of Education.
Arts (66 percent) and Science (30 per-
cent) represented 96 percent of the
total. And 25 percent of the entire
graduate year of 2503 people were
already in or committed to a teaching
career.
The total number planning to stay
at university was 146 persons higher
than 1966, and 193 higher than 1965,
and educationists believe that this trend
will continue.
“There is another Arts graduate who
doesn’t seem to present us with any
problems,” a student counsellor com-
mented. “And that is the person who
is simply at university for the joy of
education. He or she doesn’t think
gaining a degree is particularly special.
These people have a very rational out-
look they enjoy their university days
just for the fun of coming and they
take what comes next in the same
spirit.”

Defence: Three into one will go
By PETER SAMUEL
IN THE 1950 s it was obvious that the
main trouble with Australia’s defences
was that they were simply being starved
of resources. Their allocation was frozen
at £2OO million, and with costs rising
year by year this meant that the Ser-
vices were being squeezed into a steady
decline. Greater efficiency might have
helped get more military punch from
the fixed budget, but any improvement
could have been only marginal.
In the ’sixties, on the other hand, with
money being pumped more generously
into defence, the problems have become
more complex, and management has
emerged as a major limiting factor.
Right through the period of the defence
build-up from 1964 to 1967 people in
different areas of defence complained
about organisational inadequacies.
Patently stupid decisions were thrown
up, wrong equipment was ordered, no
clear sense of direction or priorities
■emerged, there were delays and ineffi-
ciencies. From Ministers down to Ser-
vice officers and public servants every-
one privately muttered their dissatis-
faction with the administrative system.
Like many institutional arrangements
it is the product of a failure to adapt
to changing conditions. The multiplicity
of administrative defence departments
is a heritage of almost 30 years ago. It
grew out of the preparations for World
War 11. Before 1939, the three Services
had been run by a single Defence
Department, but separate departments
and Ministers for Army, Navy, Air
Force, Supply, and Production were
established then. Neither the postwar
Labor Government of Mr. Chifley nor
the Liberal Governments which followed
have ever tried to do anything serious
about remedying the inefficiences to
which this administrative structure now
gives rise. In the mid-’sos there was
a surge of criticism and concern, and
a Government committee was estab-
lished. Reporting in 1957, the so-called
Morshead Committee recommended the
integration of defence administration
by abolishing the Service departments
and bringing the Army, Navy, and Air
Force directly under one Defence
Department. The Defence Minister was
to be assisted by two junior Ministers
with functional responsibilities per-
sonnel and logistics. There would be no
Service Ministers.
The important recommendations of
that Report were entirely rejected by
Sir Robert Menzies. He claimed that
there were constitutional difficulties in
the concept of junior Ministers, but it
seems more relevant that the recommen-
dations challenged his administrative
style of divide and rule. He did recog-
nise the need for greater co-ordination
and centralisation of decision-making,
but all that was done to support this
idea was the preparation of memoranda
asserting the supremacy of the Defence
Department in joint Service matters.
This helped hardly at all.
To this day, the Department of
Defence is an organisational shell. It
is hardly a department in its own right.
It is more a secretariat. All important
decisions are made by joint Service
committees composed of representatives
of the three Services or of Service
departments. The permanent Defence
Department personnel do little more
than clerical and research work for the
committees which make all relevant
decisions and, indeed, do a great deal
of the researching as well.
For many reasons, this set-up works
badly. First, it bases decision-making on
a cumbersome committee system with no
clear means of resolving disagreements.
Since all members of the committee are
equal and consensus is necessary for any
decision to be made there is generated
a constant process of referral back for
review, of behind-the-scenes bargaining,
of strange compromises, and, most of
all, of delay. Paradoxically, it is the
very antithesis of the hierarchical com-
mand system on which the Defence
Services themselves are run. It is cer-
tainly more cumbersome than the pyra-
midal organisation structure which
applies in most parts of the civilian
Public Service.
Second, the members of the com-
mittees are representatives of the Ser-
vices and Service Departments from
which they are seconded. So they are
subject to the orders and directions of
their superiors outside the Defence
Department. Defence Department com-
mittees are sometimes mere electoral
offices where the predetermined posi-
tions of the outside departments are
registered, with disagreement causing
the issue to be passed on up the line
to a higher committee to see whether
it can resolve the matter. At other
times the committees succeed as con-
ciliation commissions. But even then the
“decisions” produced are often ambigu-
ous and no real harmonisation of policy
is achieved.
Third, the Service committee mem-
bers are appointed for a short time
nominally for two years, but under the
pressure of the defence build-up this
has become a normal year or 15
months. Thus, there is very little con-
tinuity. Background knowledge and
understanding of the job of the com-
mittee are minimal.
It is because of these organisational
deficiencies that the Government is
now beginning a piecemeal reform of
the system. Last week, with a flurry of
publicity, it announced changes in part
of the Defence Department. In the
Government’s natural desire to trumpet
its innovation and in newspaper writers’
desire to find a news story the extent
of the change does seem to have 'been
exaggerated. Despite the changes, a lot
of things stay unchanged. Old-style
committees continue to dominate the
Defence Department. At the top the
Defence Committee, composed of Chiefs
of the Services and Heads of Depart-
ments, remains the group that makes
recommendations to the Defence Min-
ister and the Defence and Foreign
Affairs Committee of Cabinet. The
Chiefs of Staff themselves retain their
committee to advise the Government on
military matters. It is only in those
parts of the Defence Department that
deal with “defence joint planning” that
re-organisation is at present being
attempted.
Even this planning work will con-
tinue to be supervised by an old joint
committee the Joint Planning Com-
mittee, which is at the Brigadier, Air
Commodore, Captain, and First Assis-
tant Secretary level. It is only under
that committee that there will be in-
novations in the organisational struc-
ture. A staff will be appointed with six
sections, dealing with long-range policy,
equipment requirements, joint warfare
(doctrine), joint operations, joint oper-
ational logistics, and joint service com-
munications. Within this area new
assistant-secretary or full-colonel-level
positions and several dozen upper-level
third-division or major and half-colonel
positions will be created.
At present it is hard to find out
exactly which old committees will be
abolished. “Security” is the reason given
for this silence, but this does not seem
very likely, since the Commonwealth
Printer freely sells a “Comonwealth of
Australia Directory” which lists in great
detail the current organisation, includ-
ing the membership and functions of
all the committees and their various
staffs and sub-committees. An informed
guess is that the Joint Administrative
Planning Committee, the Joint Plan-
ning Group, the Principal Administra-
tive Officers Committees (Mainten-
ance and Material, and Personnel), the
Defence Administration Committee, and
the Joint Communications Committee
are being abolished and their jobs taken
over by the new so-called Joint Staff
and its six departmentally administered
sections. The reason for the present
silence about exactly which committees


Defence Department Secretary Bland
will be abolished is probably that no
one is yet quite sure exactly what is
going to happen.
However, it looks as if intelligence,
canteens, and scientific research and
development policy will remain under
their old committee structure, at least
for the time being. This leaves some-
thing like half the Defence Department
not re-organised.
Within the part that is to be re-
organised, the effectiveness of the
changes is still to be realised. Tempor-
ary Service officers will continue to fill
many important positions, but they will
now cease to be subject to orders from
their Service superiors—while they are
in the Defence Department—and ap-
pointments will now be for three years
rather than the present nominal two.
And the policy of the Defence Depart-
ment will be to try to keep Service
staff for longer than the nominal time
rather than have them leave early, as
now.
Yet it is not at all clear that the
defects of the old system are going to
disappear. Even if Service officers
working in the Defence Department are
no longer formally responsible to their
Services they could still tend to want
to do the best by their particular Ser-
vice rather than view problems dis-
passionately from a “total-defence
viewpoint,” to use the theme-slogan
which the Defence Department is trying
to popularise. There are also other
reasons why many features of the old
committee structure look like per-
sisting. For example, the official state-
ment pointed out that “the conceptual
approach that underlies the present
organisation that there should be
involved in Defence Department plan-
ning those who will have to execute the
plans in their own Services will be
maintained.” It went on to say that
officers working in the Defence Depart-
ment would have “full access to the
Services from which they are drawn
Defence Minister Fairhall
and to Service papers,” and also that
Defence Department Joint Staff plans
“will be remitted to the Services for
comment.” If all this is done, it heavily
qualifies the potential change in actual
procedures; it could mean that the
committee structure will have many of
its features reproduced or maintained
in the new structure. Real joint staff
planning can be achieved only by taking
members of the planning staffs of each
of the Services out of their Services
and depositing them in the Defence
Department. There is no intention to do
anything radical like this at present.
The most that is going to happen for
the moment is that the Defence Depart-
ment Planning Staff will expand quite
rapidly, while the Service planning
staffs will be contained in size, so that
their proportionate importance might
decrease.
The Defence Department’s problems
are not entirely organisational. It is
so short of men that it is probably
worse off for staff than almost any
other Canberra agency. Again, the exact
current extent of the shortage is not
revealed, allegedly for security reasons.
But my estimate is that out of a total
staff establishment of about 1150 there
are 280 positions unfilled. This is based
on Budget papers, which describe
$1,324,000 of the salary allocation of
$5,293,000 as being an “amount esti-
mated to remain unexpended.”
At least 100 new positions are
immediately due to be created, which
suggests that the staff shortage in the
Defence Department will rise to around
400, or a third of the established posi-
tions. The effectiveness of the re-
organisation, limited as it is, will
depend on how quickly and well this
huge gap in staffing is filled. It is
something of a major scandal that the
Government v has so far made no real
attempt to help the Defence Depart-
ment get staff. The External Affairs
Department, the Treasury, the Bureau
of Census and Statistics, and several
other agencies have a variety of special
schemes for attracting staff: bursaries,
cadetships, special trainee statuses, and
the like. There is as yet no special
attempt at recruitment to the Defence
Department.
In the meantime, the Defence Depart-
ment is going to have to rely heavily
on secondments from better-staffed
departments like External Affairs and
to take scarce men from the Services.
In the long-term it badly needs to
develop its own departmental traditions
and status. It will need to increase the
role of civilians relative to the military
in the way this has been done in
Britain and America, if only because
civilians with permanent status can
achieve the continuity of experience
necessary to give some depth to plan-
ning and advice. Although the first
director of the new Joint Staff is a
Serviceman Rear-Admiral W.
Dovers there is no reason why a
position like this should not in future
be held by civilian defence people.
Like other government departments,
the Defence Department needs to do
a great deal of staff training. Since
Australian universities are culpably
negligent in not providing courses in
new management and economic tech-
niques like cost-effectiveness analysis,
.the Public Service Board will eventually
have to run its own. The Defence
Department is certainly 'badly in need
of more people with training in such
techniques. It will have to develop new
budgeting and programming systems
and within these apply some of the
operations-analysis techniques which are
commonplace overseas and in modern
business firms. Without the trained
staff, attempts to emulate some of the
McNamaran emphasis on efficiency in
the U.S. Defence Forces will get
nowhere.
Top people in the Defence Depart-
ment refuse to talk about where they
think they are heading. On any out-
sider’s analysis it would seem obvious
that the old distinction between the
three Services must be steadily broken
down. It no longer corresponds to the
real divisions in defence roles or in
defence media. To some extent each
Service is required in almost every type
of conflict which can be imagined, so
they will always have to work closely
together. They nowadays overlap in-
creasingly in media. Each has to fly
aircraft and run vehicles. Aircraft and
rocketry are often interchangeable with
ground vehicles. Guns can as easily be
carried in helicopters as on trucks, and
soldiers moved by air as over the
ground. Ships come to serve the same
role as field guns and bomber planes.
Intelligence, medical services, engineer-
ing workshops, academic training, trade
training, and spare parts are needed in
similar degree by each of the Services.
So changes in war technology make
integration the inevitable direction in
which the defence structure must
develop.
The much-publicised “far-reaching
reorganisation” announced by Mr.
Fairhall is really nothing of the kind.
It is a tiny, tentative, and very belated
step in the direction of reorganisation.
At least it is a move, and it comes soon
after Sir Henry Bland has taken charge
of the Defence Department: a fact
which suggests the prospect of more
significant changes in the next couple of
years.


The Balkans of South-
east Asia’s North-west
SELF-DETERMINATION of peoples
is one of those high-minded principles
that is a good deal easier to applaud
than to apply. Neither statesmen nor
anthropologists have been able to agree
about what constitutes a “people”
entitled to self-determination, much less
how right-thinking governments should
go about helping such “peoples” to
achieve it. The current catalogue of
separatist struggles from Quebec to
Biafra is replete with unsolved prob-
lems. And now the news from southern
Asia suggests that outside intervention
may be helping to raise another whole
range of local independence movements
to explosive international proportions.
Tribal separatism is an old story in
south Asia. It derives from the historic
waves of migration through the region
and from the arbitrary national frontiers
drawn up in the colonial era. These
left all the countries from India to
Thailand (and beyond to China and
Indo-China) with pocket-settlements of
people ethnically and culturally distinct
from the majority of the population.
The map shows the main tribal groups
in this stretch of southern Asia, which
feel a sense of separate identity from
the nations whose governments claim
responsibility for them.
The British dealt with the tribal
question by administering minority
areas as so many isolated units. But
they did little or nothing to bring the
tribesmen into a wider social frame-
work. After 1947 the independent
Indian and Burmese Governments in-
herited both the tribal problem and the
British attitude toward it. They granted
the tribesmen a measure of local
autonomy. But they failed either to keep
pace with their demands for self-
government or to lessen their sense of
grievance by giving them a chance to
integrate with the dominant group. The
result has been more or less continuous
guerilla warfare between tribal insur-
gents and the Indian and Burmese
authorities.
One factor that has helped both India
and Burma keep their insurgents under
control has been the very separateness
of the separatist movements. Although
all the tribal rebels in both countries
share the minimum aim of greater
autonomy, and militant elements within
all the rebel groups share the demand
for complete independence, they have
tended to operate as completely separate
forces; they are physically divided from
each other by some of the toughest
terrain in the world. Several years ago
opposition politicians in Burma man-
aged to persuade dissident tribesmen
to join a non-Communist anti-govern-
ment front. From time to time Kachin
and Karen tribesmen have co-operated
with the Burmese Communist Party.
But neither of these links ever
materialised into a full-fledged military
alliance.
Now the situation in both India and
Burma may be changing. There is
evidence that the most active insurgent
group in India, the Nagas, are working
with the neighboring Mizos and that
both tribes have done a deal with Bur-
mese Nagas and Kachins. Some
observers go so far as to suggest the
appearance of a new sense of regional
identity among the rebels. At the same
time the level of fighting in Nagaland
has risen sharply in the past few
months. One explanation is that the
rebels are provoking battles with the
Indian Army in order to overcome divi-
sions within their own leadership.
Another explanation is that a new
element has entered the scene: China.
China has been suspected of giving
weapons and training to rebel tribes-
men along its borders for years. But
according to the Indian Government this
aid has been greatly increased recently
and is responsible for the current
upsurge of armed violence in Nagaland.
Last week, not for the first time,
Indian troops intercepted a large band
of Nagas—2oo of them in this lot—
who, the Indians claimed, were on
their way to a guerilla training camp
in China. A 250-strong group of Mizos
who raided an Indian border village
soon after were said to be following
in their tracks. Since India’s China-
bound insurgents must pass through
Burma, the Chinese are thought to have
engineered a safe-conduct agreement
with the Kachin tribesmen who control
Burma’s northernmost border with
Yunnan. The Kachins have their own
insurgency going and are reported to
have been promised a share of Chinese
arms and supplies in return.

movements against neighboring non-
Communist governments is obvious.
Although the largely Christian Nagas
are not likely converts to Maoism, they
can be useful accessories to a Com-
munist insurrection by fomenting the
instability and disruption in which it
can flourish. And the more the various
rebel groups can be persuaded to
co-ordinate their activities, the greater
the unrest they can be expected to
cause. The question is whether it is in
the Western interest to take action now
to aid Asian governments in suppress-
ing these tribal revolts.
The Americans seem to have decided
that it is. They are reported to have
been delivering substantial consign-
ments of anti-guerilla weapons to Ran-
goon, as well as training Burmese
pilots to fly the dozen or so small
fighter planes they have received from
the United States.
It may be argued that these weapons
are intended to combat only the 5000
or so Communist guerillas and not the
other tribal insurgents in Burma, who
may number anywhere from 10,000 to
20,000. But if recent reports of
co-operation between tribal factions and
the Communists are to be believed, this
line will not be easy to draw. And as
the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war proved, in
times of emergency the first distinctions
that tend to blur are the earmarks on
foreign military equipment.
Plainly, China’s intervention has
A village of the Mizo tribe in north
Assam -wide open to courtship by
China
made the Indian and Burmese tribal
problems infinitely more difficult. A
Western response to China may com-
plicate matters by providing the Bur-
mese Communists with a nationalist
anti-foreign appeal. And any foreign
injection of arms pushes tribesmen and
governments in the direction of a
strictly military resolution of their con-
flict. It is not in the interests of the
Americans or anybody else, except
possibly China, that this region should
be the scene of several long, bloody
guerilla wars. But neither is it desirable
that the area should break up into a
series of tiny statelets. That would
make it the Balkans of Asia, and it is
precisely this balkanisation, with its
jostling and competition, that draws
the bigger powers into conflict.
The problem of this part of southern
Asia cannot be solved by the surrender
of New Delhi and Rangoon to all the
tribal claims. The tribesmen have good
grounds for demanding distinctive
rights to accord with their distinctive
identities, but their arguments for inde-
pendent statehood are less convincing.
None of the tribal territories—the
largest in terms of population is
Burma’s Karen State, with 2J million
people—-would make an economically
viable unit. And locked between the
feuding neighbor-giants, India and
China, none has the prospect of remain-
ing politically viable for long.
The better solution is some form of
autonomy within the Indian and Bur-
mese unions. Both governments are still
relying more on the stick than the'
carrot in dealing with their tribesmen,
though both have begun to channel
economic aid to the tribal areas. Neither
has come up with an acceptable formula
for an accommodation Vvith tribal
separatism, even though the Indians
have been negotiating with the Nagas
for more than four years. The Chinese
intervention may yet have its uses if it
can drive some degree of urgency into
these too long-drawn-out discussions.

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
The smile on the face of the...
“FORECASTS,” says the Treasurer,
Mr. McMahon, “have seldom turned
out to be right.” That was the blunt
instrument he used to attack various
“commentators” who have been making
worried sounds in recent times about
the prospects for Australia’s balance-of-
payments and who have been urging
that Australia develop some sort of
policy that will result either in a big
boost to export income or a big cut in
imports.
It is the sort of argument he uses
when faced, as he was last week, by a
gloomy permanent head of the Depart-
ment of Trade, Sir Alan Westerman,
whose forecasts are that Australia could
expect regular net deficits on current
account of $1250 million a year after
a trade imbalance of about $3OO millon
over the next five years. This com-
pares with the $lOOO million or so
deficit on current account in the
financial year just ended, following a
trade deficit of $222 million. The only
reason we emerged from 1967-68 with
our balance of payments unscathed was
the massive inflow of foreign capital
that totalled $llOO million or almost
double the previous year. Unless some-
thing turns up, Sir Alan thinks we will
have to do even better in coming years,
and this seems unlikely, if only be-
cause of restraints on capital exports by
Britain and the United States.
But while Mr. McMahon spread
good cheer all around to offset Sir
Alan’s gloom, it would be more con-
vincing if there were some evidence
that the Treasury is doing more than
put its faith in God (and the mining
industry) to get Australia out of what
looks like a difficult period. Given
Mr. McMahon’s objection that “pro-
jections turn out to be exercises in
the logic of the assumptions on which
they are based,” they are still useful.
Indeed Mr. McMahon, who avoided
countering Sir Alan’s crystal ball with
one of his own, has nevertheless been
prepared to forecast like mad about
Australia’s gross national product,
which he expects to rise by 9 percent
in the current year and to double in
the next 13 years.
It is tempting to assume that the
reason these projections of Mr.
McMahon’s were released is because
there are no policy battles emerging
out of them w r ith other departments
like Trade, and that the reason
Treasury is not releasing its own “exer-
cises in the logic of the assumptions”
on the balance of payments is be-
cause they will be needed to attack
Trade’s protectionist arguments in
Cabinet. It may well be worth re-
minding the Treasury that there are
other people than the Trade depart-
ment to consider; that there are some
sections of Australian industry (re-
grettably too few) who like to have
some idea where they, and the
economy, are likely to be going.
If the Treasurer has some solid
ammunition with which he can
demolish Sir Alan Westerman’s pro-
jections, let him fire it. Until then,
not even Mr. McMahon’s smile will
do.
TANKERS
TACTICAL OR PRACTICAL?
IS IT MORE tactical than practical?
The oil companies are far from certain
about the intentions of Mr. Roderick
W. Miller, the maverick chairman and
managing director of the coal, ship-
ping, and hotel company that bears his
name, in his latest move into the oil-
tanker business. Last week Mr. Miller
announced he was planning to build
“several” 60,000-ton tankers in Aus-
tralia to carry Australian-produced
crude oil to refineries around the coast.
This follows his own lead of five years
ago in introducing three small tankers
(two of 18,500 tons and one of 15,500
tons) on to the Australian coast to take
advantage of the preference given in
the Navigation Act to local ships.
Miller’s latest move means that the
Government will have to take some
serious decisions about its coastal-tanker
policy, On the other hand, it seems
natural that, if only for balance-of-pay-
ments considerations, local tankers
should get preference over foreign ones.
The only serious qualification is that
this policy should not bring any serious
increase in the cost of oil. And it is
here that the international oil com-
panies and Mr. Miller disagree.
Mr. Miller claims that a big tanker
could carry crude oil from Westernport,
in Victoria, to Sydney for 14 cents a
barrel, or less than half the 35 cents
(or one cent a gallon) that the oil
companies say it would cost in one of
his existing tankers. But Mr. Miller
insists that it would cost nothing
like this to ship in his current tankers;
he puts it at about 20 cents a barrel.
If the cost saving of his big tankers is
only 6 cents a barrel in Mr. Miller’s
arithmetic, it will still leave a very high
Bigger and better to come?
price indeed the way the oil companies
do their sums.
So, is Mr. Miller talking about run-
ning his own big tankers (which would
need assured cargoes to be economic)
to bring “reduced petrol prices for
motorists,” as is his present claim, or
is he simply waging another battle
against oil to protect his coal interests?
There seems little doubt that his first
venture into smaller tankers was to
attempt to force up the price of fuel
oils that had been competing with coal
at “unfair” prices; his claim is that
petrol-users have, in effect, been sub-
sidising the price of residual oils which
came in large quantities from the
“heavy” imported crudes used by Aus-
tralian refineries. But by now his tactics
may well have changed, as coal’s major
markets are overseas and as the Aus-
tralian crudes that will be supplying at
least 60 percent of the market in the
early 1970 do not leave nearly as much
residual oil on being refined, j
So the market position of coal has
improved at the same time as the need
for dumping residual oils may be
reduced. As a result, it is just possible
that Mr. Miller is getting into the big
tankers in the hope of making straight-
forward profits on their operation for
his company, a suggestion that seems
too simple to be true, especially as his
annual accounts have given little indica-
tion of whether or not his existing tan-
kering operations are profitable.
COMPLAINTS CORNER
COSTS AND TARIFFS
COST INCREASES were the main
complaint of industry representatives
when they met with Cabinet last week
in their annual consultations. And
most concentrated on the metal trades
decision of the Arbitration Commis-
sion as the main factor. Most supported
the view of the Primary Producers
Union that “the Commission should be
changed to include personnel who, by
training and experience, could assess
not only legal aspects of a dispute but
the far-reaching results likely to flow
from wage increases.”
The Chambers of Commerce devoted
much of its submission to a detailed
justification of the Board’s plans to
publish a classification.
“The Tariff Board, in seeking a


means of bringing greater precision
into tariff making, has outlined pro-
posals for a systematic review of the
structure and levels of protection re-
ceived by local industry. The classi-
fication of industries into high-,
medium-, and low-protection groupings
will enable the Board to assess the
broader effects of its recommendations
on related industries and the economy
as a whole.
“Rather than disrupting investment
in industry, as some of the Board’s
critics have suggested, ACCA believes
that the proposals will bring greater
certainty into tariff making and assist
those making investment decisions.
While some high-cost industries may
oppose the Board’s proposals, the more
efficient sections of Australian industry
have much to gain.”
MEN AND MATTERS
MR. GEORGE LECOUTEUR’S new
appointment to the chair of the Com-
mittee for the Economic Development
of Australia is as pertinent to that insti-
tution as wool is to Australia’s export
trade. Formed in 1960 by business
leaders and academics to carry out
objective research on problems of
economic development, CEDA has con-
cerned itself with subjects such as auto-
mation, wages, productivity, and
demography, but, above all, with export
potential. It is an environment in which
Mr. LeCouteur is now very much at
home, but his beginnings were purely
academic.
Born in Perth 53 years ago, where
his father was one of the first professors
at the university, Mr. LeCouteur’s early
life was spent following his father’s
academic career in Melbourne, back to
Perth, and then on to Sydney. At Syd-
ney University he took an Arts degree
and two years of Law before going to
England in 1938 to take up a teaching
appointment at Marlborough College,
returning to Australia on the outbreak
of war.
Marriage in November, 1939, to a
“country girl” from Orange was fol-
lowed only too quickly by the Army
early in 1940.
But after the war there followed what
Mr. LeCouteur recalls as one of the
Byrne Hart
George LeCouteur
most satisfying periods of his life, as
guidance officer in the Commonwealth
Returned Servicemen’s Training Scheme
at Sydney University.
In 1947 came the break with
academic life and the beginning of an
association with wool which was to
become the focal point of his career.
Starting with Commonwealth Wool
and Produce Ltd., Mr. LeCouteur
moved to the British-owned pastoral
house and property owner Australian
Mercantile Land and Finance Ltd.,
becoming manager for the Victoria
and Riverina areas in 1957, assistant
general manager in 1961, and general
manager in 1964.
Wool together with economic re-
search are also his hobbies. So it is not
surprising that his first contact with
CEDA in 1964 was quickly and firmly
cemented by the offer and acceptance
.of the vice-presidency in 1965. Wool
fitted CEDA like a hand fits a glove,
says Mr. LeCouteur, and his personal
stand against the diversions of wool-
marketing manipulators and his efforts
toward order and skilled research into
the wool-producing industry to identify
the real problems and promote rational
solutions to them well reflects CEDA’s
cool approach to Australia’s economic
problems and its recognition of the sig-
nificance of wool as a contributor to
general economic growth.
In CEDA, Mr. LeCouteur has his
academic links. As president of the
Commercial Law Association, he has
an outlet for his early legal interests.
And as chairman of the Advisory
Board of the Civilian Maimed and
Limbless Association, he finds a similar
source of satisfaction to that which he
discovered while working for the
CRSTS after the war.
Even with his family mostly grown
up, his eldest son a graduate in agri-
cultural science, now out in the bush
following his father into wool, a
daughter in the design field, and a
younger son in his last year at school,
Mr. LeCouteur considers too many
things important to have any time to
spare, though he does admit to
occasionally indulging a love of music.
A MAN WHO HAS made sterling
contributions to Queensland’s industrial,
commercial, and community life, for
which he won the C.B.E. last year, Mr.
Byrne Hart, is retiring from the prin-
cipal board of the AMP Society.
He is still working hard in his own
chartered accountancy business which
his father, F. M. Hart, founded 50 years
ago, so this resignation does not mean
general retirement, although he is 73.
Mr. Hart is a fellow of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants, and has seven
partners in his firm.
He maintains the chair with
Wormald Bros. (Qld.) Pty. Ltd.,
Hornibrook Highway Ltd., Amagraze
Ltd. and subsidiaries (of which his
son is also a director), and of Mc-
Taggart Primary Producers’ Co-
operative Association Co. Ltd and its
subsidiaries. He also retains a seat in
the boardrooms of Castlemaine Perkins
Ltd., Millaquin Sugar Co. Ltd. (where
there is another Hart, W. H., but he is
no relation), of Schweppes (Australia)
Ltd., and McTaggarts F. and G. Wool
Selling Co-operative Ltd. His chair-
manship of the Queensland Board of
Advice to the National Bank of Aus-
tralasia continues.
All his life Mr. Hart has been a
strong advocate of the expansion of
Queensland’s industrial and agricul-
tural base. His interest in livestock
extends to grazing in Central Queens-
land, where he has a well-known cattle
stud. His progressiveness in this sphere
has considerably advanced the State’s
cattle industry. His two sons both
have cattle properties. .
HOUSING
PRE-BUDGET LOBBY
WHILE PRIMARY PRODUCERS,
manufacturers, retailers, miners, and
all the other traditional pressure groups-
put the same pre-Budget cases to the
Federal Government’s economic meet-
ings last week, another less well-known
but highly organised organisation was
left on the outer.
The four-year-old Housing Industry
Association, unable to take part in the
official talks, was not, however, to be
outdone. Three of the Association’s
head men came to Canberra for “dis-
cussions” with Government officials on
the Budget. And though they failed to
put their case to the Cabinet sub-
committee they took advantage to air
it before the national Press.
A special Press conference was called
in a Canberra hotel and the Press
courted with savories, liquid refresh-
ments, and a five minute “p e P” talk on
the HlA’s history and future plans.
Though refusing to describe themselves
as lobbyists, the Association probably
did as much pre-Budget lobbying as
any of the other organisations w'hich
were allowed official representation.
The Association was set up four years
ago, combining all facets of the hous-
ing industry. Where the Master
Builders’ Association, which does have
official representation at the budgetary
talks, represents builders only, the HIA
claims a much broader base. Everyone
from the real-estate developer, the
financier, the builder, on down to the
sub-contractor who installs light fittings
is represented by the Association. As
well, the Association has realised the
value of presenting well - documented
cases and has established a strong
research section directed and chaired
by two Bachelors of Commerce, Messrs.
N. G. Crowley and M. K. Prowse.
The Association believes its views
are considered if not actively sought
by Government and even lays claim to
having prompted the Government’s
decision to lift Commonwealth Savings
Bank housing loans to a limit of $BOOO
last April.

its research, the Association’s case, put
to the Press for consideration, went into
general industry as well as housing
itself. Justifying its opposition to in-
creased taxation, the Association’s
president, Mr. R. L. Seares, said
expected wage increases would lift
Commonwealth Government revenue
by $350 million from taxation receipts
this year. The Treasurer, Mr. Seares
told the Press, should take “positive
action” to encourage production and
productivity in industry.
Warning of a possible four percent
increase in housing costs this financial
year, Mr. Seares added (somewhat
inconsistently) that the industry had
the capacity to increase its output
substantially. The Association believed
the Goverment should encourage a
higher rate of building and give “con-
sistent” financial support. Banks should
be allowed to lend more for housing,
particularly new housing, and housing
loan limits should be regularly reviewed
Higher building costs and loans
in the light of increased housing costs.
Yet when questioned on the possibility
of any improvements in loan limits
resulting in higher building costs, Mr.
Seares denied the two were related.
Previous housing cost increases which
had immediately followed provision of
increased finance were only coinciden-
tal, he said. It was just unfortunate that
the cost burden had risen at the same
time more finance was made available.
The Association plans to set up a
new division in Western Australia this
week, giving it representation through-
out mainland Australia. Although Mr.
Seares is non-commital on the Associa-
tion’s plans for becoming a major
spokesman for the industry, he adds
that it represents the industry more
fully than any other single organisa-
tion, and that HlA’s headquarters
might have to move to Canberra in
the near future, where the other pres-
sure groups ACMA, the Associated
Chambers of Commerce, and other
organisations are now based.
Next year, the Association will seek
THE BULLETIN, July 13, 1968
official representation at the pre-
Budget talks. Yet the Association
might have a long wait before this is
agreed to. The talks are already essen-
tially a public-relations exercise. It is
unlikely the Government will wish to
add another organisation, no matter
how good its research, to an already
unwieldy series of meetings.
INDONESIA
TORTUOUS ECONOMIC
SEARCH
THE ECONOMIC REGENERATION
of Indonesia isn’t going to be easy and
it is beyond dispute that we have as big
a stake as any outside country in assur-
ing its success. It is not simply a ques-
tion of seizing new trade opportunities
as the economic escalator moves up,
though possibly like other countries —
West Germany and Britain in particular
—Australian moves in the past year or
so to get in on the ground floor of the
country’s economic recovery after the
deflationary shambles bequeathed from
Sukarno are understandable even if
not so benevolent. We should be going
much further than we’ve done thus
far in our efforts to bolster the Indo-
nesian economy, not only by developing
trade but also and more cogently by
outright economic support. The
trouble is perhaps the absence of public
conscience in the matter in Australia or
maybe of understanding of the task
facing Indonesia in buttressing the new
political stability with economic
strengthening.
In an attempt to improve Australia’s
understanding of the problems involved,
the Committee for the Economic
Development of Australia recently
sponsored the publication of a study
outlining those which face the country
in drafting its five-year (1969-73)
economic rehabilitation plan by Jusef
Paglaykim (of the University of
Indonesia and a senior research fellow
of the ANU) and K. D. Thomas, a
lecturer in economics at Latrobe Uni-
versity. They have come up with some
surprising angles. For instance, they
question the wisdom of what appears
to be a present trend in Indonesian
economic planning the downgrading
of the role of the Government enter-
prises lin favor of private enterprises.
They point out that the private sector
in Indonesia lacks the capital to play a
crucial role in development at this stage
and that in the short run, at least, it
may be impractical to discard the
managerial experience that has been
' acquired in the Government enterprises.
They also find that the Government,
which has the commanding heights of
the economy under its control, has little
choice in playing the leading role in
Indonesian economic development. The
question is, they believe, “shall private
enterprise be encouraged or gradu-
ally eliminated?” They follow the
“tortuous” search for an economic

CATTLE
PROBLEMS OF EXPANSION
IF THE CANBERRA bureaucracy is
often depressingly secretive and unwill-
ing to reveal the data that it gathers, in
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics
there is a shining exception to the rule.
That agency must churn out for the
public about as much useful information
as all the rest of the Canberra Public
Service put together. Its “Quarterly
Review of Agricultural Economics,” for
instance, is undoubtedly the most infor-
mative publication coming out of Can-
berra, and this is only one of a set of
booklets it regularly publishes.
One article in the current “Review”
gives insights into the developing
trucking industry in North Australia
consequent on the expansion of cattle
production and expenditure on beef
roads. In four years the number of
cattle being moved by road has doubled.
Rail transport has carried hardly any
more animals, while droving has
declined in importance. The business is
extremely profitable with trucking firms
reaping a steady 19 to 20 percent profit
on the depreciated value of their equip-
ment. Not surprisingly, the profitability
of the large firms with large road trains
is bigger and they can offer cheaper
rates than smaller businesses. The costs
of firms carrying less than 30 cattle per
vehicle were generally around four cents
per animal mile, compared to around
three cents for large vehicles.
Ideas of greatly expanded cattle pro-
duction have also moved across to the
northern parts of Western Australia.
Hamburgers have been manna from
heaven for the Kimberleys for many
years. The tough, stringy beef grown
there is ideal for American ham-
burgers, and the shorthorns are whizzed
along the beef roads to the processing
plants to make a lucrative export
industry. There are about 600,000 cattle
on the ranges currently. But a sub-
stantial lift to these numbers is
promised in work with Townsville
lucerne, being studied at the research
station of Kalumburu.
One of the obstacles to such a
scheme, remarkably enough, is the
Land Act. Section 105 denies the pas-
toralist the right to intensive manage-
ment of the property he handles under
a pastoral lease. He is not allowed to
cultivate pasture. However, this is one
hurdle Premier Brand has undertaken
to examine, if not to clear, particularly
if Townsville lucerne continues to live
up to its promise.

BRIEFLY
The economy ’ Australia had a trading deficit of $222
million in the last financial year, ten times as large
as in 1966-67, as exports rose only $23.6 million to
$3047 million but imports jumped to $3270 million.
With “invisible” items, this could have brought a
deficit on current account of $lOOO million.
Offsetting this, and preserving Australia’s balance-of-
payments position, apparent inflow of overseas capital
may have doubled for 1967-68 to $llOO million
from the 1966-67 figure of $530 million, according
to Treasurer McMahon.
The markets' With the profit season only just
opening, there have been few company results to
influence the market’s mood . . . CSR picked up 36c
to $6.36, Consolidated Milk added 5c to 70c, and
Dunlop rose 18c to $2.38 in a quiet industrial market.
British Tobacco starred with a final price of $3.65,
the highest point in seven years, and 75c increment
since the May interim report.
Most of the recent front runners were quiet,
but held relatively steady. CRA edged up 45c to
$19.10, Hamersley slipped 40c to $14.50, Mt. Isa
shed 6c to $8.30, New BH picked up 80c
to $16.80, WMC were 5c higher at $15.05, and Peko
put on 35c to $14.35 . . . London-based North
Kalgurli added $1 on the week to $l2 and its
Scotia lease partner Great Boulder put on
50c to $14.80. Longreach was the subject of
rumors, and ran up to $1.40, closing on Friday
at $1.28 . . . Timor rose 15c to $l.BO, while
Mid-Eastern, going ex-priority to the minerals
float, shed 26c on the week, finishing at $1.19 . . .
Prior to BH South’s issue news, the shares slipped
18c on the week to $6.62. Silver Valley
continued to yo-yo, bouncing up 35c to $2.10,
Hill 50 crept up 17c to $1.39, and Barrier, one of the
last to run in this minerals boom, gathered
29c to $1.35, after touching $1.60, on U.K. recommendations.
Companies' The first week of the new fiscal
year is traditionally quiet. One of . the first out with
its 1967-68 results was Brooker Holdings, which
needs funds. It will make a two-for-five issue
at 70c and an issue to employees, lifting
capital to $638,500 compared with $336,250 a year
ago. Latest profit was a 38 percent advance on 1967.
A steady 10 percent was paid by the CBA for the
20th year in succession (except for the 1966
centenary bonus 2 percent) . . . but the CBS of Sydney
is paying 11 percent, 1 percent better than usual.
An American company, Aetna Life Insurance of
Connecticut, has bid $9.3 million cash for the Producers
and Citizens Co-operative Assurance group.
The offer goes to United Holdings Ltd., holding company
for the Australian group, and is
$4.50 cash for each United share.
Australian Motor Industries Ltd. had to pay
$1,169,592 to the U.K. Leyland group and
American Motors as compensation for their relinquishment
of share options last year. The options
were granted in 1963 in exchange for cash loans.
Esso’s net earnings recovered from $12,000 to
$976,000 in the 1967 calendar year, excluding a non-
trading item. lan Potter and Co. and AUC
have taken firm $2O million of the $3O million
debenture issue.
British Tobacco’s AP and D subsidiary bought the
Geelong Coca-Cola franchise-holder . . .
Fowlers Vacola earned slightly less in the year to
April, with result of $83,000.
Reckitt and Colman made its first foray into the
takeover field, with the acquisition of two private
pharmaceutical companies, R. V. Harvey Pty. Ltd.

Speculator’s Diary
THE BIG WINNINGS
THAT WERE SPENT
ON BIG NEW CARS
IT MUST HAVE been an unlucky
person who didn’t do well in the
market last year. It was a record for
turnovers, indicies, and profits. Take
Sydney, for example: in the financial
year to June 30, share buyers on the
Sydney Stock Exchange spent as much
on their purchases as did the whole
of Australia on new cars; they spent
as much as all the shoppers in the
country’s three main department stores,
Woolworths, Coles, and Myers. They
spent $863 million.
During the same period that the big
spenders were letting their heads go
(and probably because of it) the Syd-
ney Stock Exchange All Ordinaries
Index wasn’t being left behind one
little bit. In the 12 months it rose an
unheard of 239 points to a new all-
time high record of just over 600.
Everyone’s cup overflowed so much that
even the drought ended. The share-
holders, by rights, should have made a
fortune and the brokers, I imagine, did
likewise helping them and, undoubtedly,
joining them.
One industry that should have done
well from brokers and investors alike
last year is the car industry. Big win-
nings on the Exchange means big new
cars. This,- in turn, means big profits
for the people who sell the cars. I
bought 200 W. T. Coggins. This com-
pany is one of the largest General
Motors-Holden’s dealers in Sydney and
if it doesn’t do well this year, I don’t
know who will. The company’s interim
report, which was released in February,
however, was not all that revealing.
All it said was the sales were up 19
percent and that the net profit showed
a “favorable increase.” However, with
the sales of Holden cars up 21 percent
in the eleven months to May this year,
the company looks as though it must
be set for a grand finale.
My second buy this week is yet
another recovery stock. It’s R. and N.
Statham, a Newcastle company whose
main preoccupation is the supply and
erection of rural and industrial build-
ings. Last year the company was hit by
the drought and didn’t do too well. Its
shares didn’t do very well, either. They
dived from a high of $0.99 to a low of
$0.34. This year the rains have come
and the company’s prospects and its
share price, now $0.75, both look much
healthier. In the six months to Decem-
ber 31, the company earned $253,000.
This is over three times as much as it
earned in the whole twelve months of
1966/67, and is equivalent to an annual
earning rate of 38.3 percent. Although
the company’s business is a seasonal one,
profits in the second half will not
necessarily be as high as they were in
the first six months. My guess is that
with the improved pastoral conditions
they will at least be high enough to put
the company back on to a decent earn--
ing rate to fully restore the dividend
rate, which was chopped down last year
from 10 percent to 5 percent, and to
puts its shares on to a higher level
than they are standing at now. In this
hope I bought 200.
This week I’ve had a new-year clean
up and have sold off four stocks. All
made profits. William Adams made $5O,
Commercial Bank of Australia $67,
Wigmore $266, and H. C. Sleigh con-
vertible notes $2O.

Waiting will test confidence
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
ONE THING is certain about the
current mining boom; it takes a lot of
time before an initial discovery turns
into cash in the bank. It can even
take a long time to transform a dis-
covery into a commercial deposit. And
in at least two of the significant dis-
coveries in recent times, there is going
to be a lot more waiting before the
deposits, which look 90 percent likely
to be commercial, are finally proved so.
These are the Great Boulder-North
Kalgurli nickel find at Scotia in Wes-
tern Australia and the Broken Hill
South phosphate discovery in north-
western Queensland.
At Scotia, the chairman of North
Kalgurli says the partners would know
“within a year” whether the leases are
an economic proposition. In the mean-
time, however, there will be plenty of
information becoming available that
will point toward such a conclusion.
For instance, the three diamond drill-
ing rigs working at Scotia have been
seeking to intersect the sulphide miner-
alisation encountered in the first drill
hole at 450 feet. Good results from
these holes would give indications of
stability of the mineralisation and after
that, the partners will be drilling north
and south of the initial strike to deter-
mine the ore-body. This will take quite
some time.
The same goes for the latest
Anaconda-CRA-New Broken Hill nickel
strikes in two places near Widgie-
mooltha, where the company has been
drilling for about a year and has been
actively investigating the area for three
years. While it is true that these con-
tinuing discoveries by this group in-
crease the spread of likely areas where
others may discover nickel, and so adds
an interesting touch to many small
speculative stocks, all this also means
that it will take a long, long time before
many of the smaller speculative com-
panies can prove their discoveries (if
and when they make them).
Current prices for many of these
whose only attractions are propinquity
to a major lease may well not hold up
if a lot of waiting is involved.
The waiting time at Broken Hill
South could well be very long indeed,
judging by the company’s comments.
In announcing the latest new issue (for
an unstated amount), directors said that
the project had not progressed much
further from its state last November,
when it was described as Hamersley-
like in size and complexity. But with a
“large proportion” of the new issue
going to “bring forward” the phosphate
project, it is clear that the company
is pretty confident about the outcome,
although it keeps insisting that its
development is a “long-term project.”
THE J. B. WERE report on beach
sands beneficiation leaves no doubt
about the primary benefits; Western
Titanium NL, they say, will lift
profitability fivefold in the next three
years. Of the industries likely to feel
the secondary benefits, none is better
placed than the coal industry. Coal is
being supplied to Western Titanium by
the Griffin Coal Mining Co. Ltd. at the
rate of one-half to two-thirds of a ton
of coal to one ton of ilmenite.
So far this has had little impact on
Griffin’s production. The Western
Titanium semi-commercial plant,
although its capacity has been increased
from the planned 10,000 to 15,000 tons
per annum throughout, calls on com-
paratively little of Griffin’s 550,000
tons annual production of semi-
bituminous coal. But when Western
Titanium steps up to a 100,000-ton plant
in 1971 the impact will be greater; if,
as seems most likely, Westralian Oil
Ltd. follow soon after this, ilmenite
beneficiation will be playing a major
part in Griffin’s demand pattern.
With Western Titanium it is a matter
of when, not if. The annual meeting
was told in May that “assuming that
the upgraded material proves satisfac-
tory to consumers on a plant scale
basis, then, with the data provided by
the operation of the semi-commercial
plant, we propose to commence as soon
as possible the design of a 100,000-ton
plant so that we shall be in a position
to take full advantage of markets which
our inquiries indicate will be offering
from 1971 onward.” Despite some teeth-
ing troubles, the upgraded material has
proved most satisfactory.
Griffin coal is assured of getting the
extra tonnages, if only because the coal
is so close to Capel and it has been used,
successfully, throughout the testing
time.
In layman’s language, ilmenite is
titanium dioxide and iron oxides
roughly in 56-44 proportions. The bene-
ficiation seeks to improve the propor-
tion of titanium dioxide. It does this
by attacking the oxygen in the iron
oxides—cooking them out in a rotary
kiln with coal. This leaves titanium
dioxide, iron, and about 10 percent
impurities. The iron is “agitated and
aerated” —in other words, forced out on
bubbles. This leaves “synthetic rutile”
with a titanium dioxide content upward
of 90 percent. This sells at $75 a ton,
it is anticipated, compared with ilmenite
at $5-$7.
The Queensland group Murphyores
The Chartist says:
ANDERSON MEAT INDUSTRIES ;LTD. now appeals as a sound recovery
situation on technical grounds. It has formed a base reversal (consolidation pattern
after falling to a low of 17c in October, 1967. Prices have already risen to 29c
during the current weeks cn extremely high volume. The first target is about 34c,
the second about 54c, and there is every possibility that prices will utlimately move
up to the high of 85c of the “1965 top.” At this Ipoint, the situation would call for
reassessment. Last sale price on 4/7/68 —26c.

Holdings plans to move into beneficia-
tion on a similar process, but this
would not affect Griffin. The Westralian
Oil move would. Mr. Edgar Elvey,
chairman of directors of North Kal-
gurli, is on the boards of both com-
panies to strengthen already close rela-
tions between them. Although no com-
pany announcement has been made,
Westralian Oil plans to adopt a scheme
for improving its beach-sands titanium
dioxide content; this will probably
follow divorcing of the company’s oil
and beach-sands interests, with the oil
interests being merged with those of
Lennard Oil NL, which is in the pro-
cess of formation.
There is another allied prospect for
Griffin Coal in metallising. This pro-
cess is very similar to beneficiation. In
both, the oxygen in the iron oxides is
cooked out by fanned-in coal. Griffin
has been asked to submit samples to
Hamersley Iron, who intend moving
into metallising to increase the iron con-
tent of their ores before shipping it out
as sponge iron. Hanwright and the
Sentinel group also have plans to metal-
lise—a technical breakthrough rated as
more important than another steel-
making facility.
Like Western Titanium, Griffin are
pioneers in this field. But they certainly
do not have the field to themselves.
Already the Thiess Holdings group, who
are in coal in a big way both through
the Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui consortium
and on their own account, are drilling
extensively in the Collie area. They are

Mining
PEKO-WALLSEND POURS
NEW LIFE
INTO MOUNT MORGAN
THE FIRST MAJOR result of the
tussle last year between Power Mining
and Peko-Wallsend for control of
Mount Morgan has come to light with
the s4£-million re-equipment program
to be undertaken at the Mount Morgan
mine. At that time there was plenty
of talk about future developments, such
as the company’s iron-ore project at
Mount Bundey, in the Northern Terri-
tory, its investment in Consolidated
Metal Products Limited, and it was
even suggested that Peko might use
Mount Morgan’s facilities for smelting
ore carted from Tennant Creek.
All these possibilities appeared to
have overlooked the scope for' further
development at the Mount Morgan
mine itself. Each year some four million
tons of material is removed from the
open-cut mine near Rockhampton, in
Queensland this is an earth-moving
operation of some substance, ranking
with concerns like Thiess-Peabody-
Mitsui (coal) and Goldsworthy Mining
(iron ore). As such, a difference of
cents in the cost of extracting and re-
moving each ton of overburden and
ore can have a sizable effect on profits.
In the case of Mount Morgan, the
savings from the re-equipment program
could be up to ten cents per ton on
the four million tons it handles each
year. This saving would be on the cost
of delivering ore to the mill.
In the open-cut itself new and larger
excavators will replace the present ones,
which range in size from to 5 tons
capacity. Transporters capable of carry-
ing 35 tons will replace the existing
trucks, which have a capacity of only 15
tons each. The use of such equipment
should be sufficient to effect cost savings
of up to 10 cents per ton of material
extracted on present rates of mining,
and, at the lower costs which this will
bring, there will be scope for increases in
overall production using lower-grade
ore, the extraction of which would be
feasible at lower costs. Should the com-
pany decide to do this when the pro-
gram is completed, ore and overburden
costs per ton could well be reduced by
a further margin.
At the crushing mill, one large crusher
station is to be built with sufficient
capacity to replace the three units being
used at present. Here again, there
should be cost savings of some conse-
quence on the 1.3 million tons of ore
milled each year, but the new roaster
to be installed in the company’s smelter
will probably be the main source of
cost savings besides the open-cut opera-
tion. The smelter was built more than
20 years ago, and at present the copper
concentrates produced by the treatment
mill pass through (to extract com-
bustible impurities) two or three of
four older-type roasters. The new
roaster is to be of the fluidised bed-type
in which the concentrate moves on a
cushion of air. It will mean a better-
quality matte for furnace feed and will
allow an increase, if necessary, in the
amount of lower-grade concentrate, as
well as more efficient smelting opera-
tions, which have been on a relatively
high-cost basis in the past.
The cost savings from the use of
better equipment in both the extraction
of ore and its smelting will certainly
provide an adequate return on the
$4.5-.million cost. But there will be
other benefits, too; as costs fall, the
amount of ore which can be mined
economically increases, and the pro-
gram will, therefore, either bring scope
for higher production during the
remaining life of the mine or mean
that the life of the operation is
extended. Perhaps both of these are
possible, depending on the movements
of prices for both copper and gold, of
which the company produced 100,000
ounces last year. At the time that Power
Mining made its bid last year the com-
pany’s life was said to be 15 years,
using the current rate of extraction and
allowing for the fact that each year a
substantial part of the ore mined comes
from outside proved ore reserves. There
is no doubt (assuming no collapse of
metal prices) that the money to be
spent will mean a good increase in this
figure.
Contributing to this will be the added
life given to the mine by the sulphuric-
acid plant at Gladstone, which is to
use pyrites from Mount Morgan as its
raw material. A total of 200,000 tons
per annum has been contracted for,
beginning late in 1970, but production
will probably require a somewhat
higher figure. From its many years’
operations prior to 1939, when the
smelter was built, Mount Morgan has
accumulated about eight million tons
of pyrites. When, in the far-distant
future, all the copper-gold ore has been
exhausted, the pyritic ore which con-
tains the mine at present may itself
become an asset,
It should be pointed out that the
improvement in efficiency expected to
flow from the current program is due
not to better management but to new
and better plant which the company
has not in the past been able to afford.
Mount Morgan’s management has an
excellent reputation, but it has only
been in the past few years that earn-
ings have approached the $1 million
mark due to better copper prices.
The current program will, to a
large extent, insulate the company
against the expected fall in copper
prices over the next year or two, and
almost certainly means that the mine
will not slip back to becoming a semi-
marginal operation relying on good
metal prices for adequate profitability.
ESTIMATES FROM the Depart-
ment of National Development put
mineral export earnings at $920 million
by 1971-72, three financial years from
now. This is on the basis of firm con-
tracts signed.
From this year on, iron ore becomes
the biggest item: $lll million. It then
rises to $193 million in 1970 according
to firm contracts, and with the Cliffs
offer to West Australian Mining
added in it goes to $232 million in that
year. From then on the certain export
income is steadier.
Surprisingly, Australia is not likely
to be the largest iron-ore exporter in
the world. The Russians are estimated
to be between 44 and 61 million tons,
the Canadians will come next with
33-37 million tons, the Swedes third at
17-19 million tons, while Australia and
Liberia are likely to be trying for fourth
position in the world-league ladder.
We will, of course, be the largest sup-
plier of Japan, though far from abso-
lutely predominant, supplying 32 per-
cent of the requirements, with South
America providing 25 percent, India 18
percent, Africa 12 percent, and North
America 9 percent.
On the Department’s figures, Aus-
tralia should be able to diversify its
sales of iron ore. Japan’s demands are
expected to grow most voraciously, but
other countries’ imports are also ex-
pected to grow strongly. Overall world
imports are expected to range between
283 and 316 million tons in 1970, com-
pared with 212 million tons in 1965.
British imports are growing by 5
percent a year. Italy, Germany, and
France, which make up the European
Coal and Steel Community, will be
importing 82 to 90 million tons in 1970,
compared with 67 million tons in 1965.
As the Departmental publication
says: “On the basis of signed contracts,
exports of iron ore from Australia are
expected to increase from 2 million
tons recorded in 1966 to 25 million
tons in 1970. Japan is expected to be
the world’s principal importer of iron
ore before 1970, and will continue to
be the principal market for Australian
iron ore. However, the import needs of
European steel mills and possibly U.S.
mills should provide substantial, though
smaller, alternative markets for Aus-
tralian iron ore in the next few years.”

E. A. GREENWOOD
PROMISES TO BE
ANOTHER KOLOTEX
READERS OF this column may
recall my report (Bulletin, February
24, 1968) on Kolotex, with the advice
that this textile stock had something
really outstanding to offer. Investors
who had bought Kolotex on my
recommendation would now be show-
ing a capital gain of over 130 percent.
I think that I have now uncovered
another Kolotex. The company in
question, E. A. Greenwood Ltd., is still
only small; the directors control about
55 percent of the stock, and with only
515,993 50c ordinary shares on issue,
there is not much scrip around. Still,
this company has a decided future, good
management, and is very ambitious.
The company had its beginnings in
1920, when E. A. Greenwood founded
a small business as a sole trader im-
porting and wholesaling English and
Continental furnishings and curtain
materials. In 1951, the public company
was formed and the company is listed
only on the Sydney Stock Exchange.
The most dramatic change in Green-
wood’s fortunes came about in 1959,
with the reverse take-over of the Novel-
trim group of companies making the
well known range of “Lanza” handbags
and accessories. This brought to the
helm of Greenwood, Ernest Lunzer
(now aged 56), who today is chairman
and managing director. R. C. Green-
wood (50) is also an executive director
in charge of the furnishing-fabric side
of the business.
Lunzer, an Austrian by birth and a
manufacturer of ladies’ handbags back
in Vienna, came to Sydney in 1939 and
recommenced his business, which today
ranks in the first three in Australia.
One of Noveltrim’s competitors is
Camel, the majority interest of which
was acquired by Kolotex in 1967.
Originally, like most clothing acces-
sories, handbags were a utility item,
made in leather, and in very plain
colors, black, brown, and navy. Today,
handbags are a fashion item, alive with
color (there are at least ten to 15
colors being used), and consumption
continues to grow as there is an inbuilt
obsolescence factor, which makes the
industry very profitable. The handbag
industry takes its color cue from
fashions in footwear, and, with changing
color preferences, unfashionable hand-
bags are hurled to the bottom of the
wardrobe.
Australian women over the age of
15 now own about 8-12 handbags each.
Women in the 15-25 age group buy
about 60 percent of the total volume
of handbags, compared with about 25
percent for women 25-45, and about 15
percent for women over 45. Today,
less than 20 percent of handbags are
made in leather and the balance con-
sists of various types of synthetic
materials, including imitation leathers.
About 50 percent of handbags retail
in the $4-$6 bracket, and this market
is dominated by women in the 16-25
age group. Synthetic bags sell up to
$lO, and leather bags retail up to $4O
for imported, very chic Italian designs
which Noveltrim have exclusively made
for them in Italy.
The Noveltrim subsidiary of E. A.
Greenwood buys in from overseas
sources about 90 percent of the raw
materials, including linings and frames;
and, in manufacture, the handbags go
through the stages of being cut, sewn,
processed, and finished. Some of the
production time is now being speeded
up with electronic heat-sealing equip-
ment, and with the use of large-
capacity presses which cut multiple
layers of materials, and this compares
with the time-consuming process a
decade ago when each part of the bag
was hand cut. The “Lanza” range in-
cludes handbag accessories which are im-
ported from a wide variety of countries,
and these embrace purses, evening bags,
viscose bags, which have a straw-like
appearance, baskets, and shopping ware.
Overseas visits to the fashion centres
are made about three times yearly.
There is a leaning on European and
U.S. fashion trends, though these are
not slavishly followed, but interpreted
for Australian conditions. With about
120 retail accounts throughout Aus-
tralia, the company assists retailers in
promotion. About 70 percent of hand-
bags are sold by department stores and
about 30 percent by specialist bag stores.
Handbags represent about 50 percent
of sales and group income, and the
balance of the business is in the con-
verting and wholesaling of curtain
fabrics. Few investors understand the
wholesaling function and it is readily
assumed that this is a dying business
with little profit margin. This can be,
and in Greenwood’s case is, far from
the truth. Greenwood is one of Aus-
tralia’s four larerest converting houses
in furnishing fabrics and trade is
booming. A converter is a principal
who creates his own designs and styles
and has materials manufactured by
mills expressly for him. Ten years ago
the converter in furnishing fabrics did
not exist in Australia and the trade
followed the dull routine of looking at
samples of Continental and other over-
seas materials, and ordering supplies,
without being able to influence the
designs or color ranges for the Aus-
tralian market. The main change came
about when furnishings became
regarded as a fashion industry. Instead
of buying on price grounds alone, the
consumer now looks for design, color,
and quality as well as price.
There have been marked changes in
retail merchandising methods over
recent years. Where, up to ten years
ago, the universal-provider type of
department stores were virtually the
sole suppliers to the public, today an
ever-increasing percentage of consumers
purchase their curtains from furnishing
specialists and interior decorators; and,
in the field of contract furnishing for
hotels, clubs, and office buildings, con-
tract specialists have almost exclusively
taken over from retailers.
Retail selling has, therefore, settled
into a pattern where department stores
largely depend on sales volume from
custom-made drapes sold from minia-
ture curtain displays, and specialists
sell in the home, using “coathanger”
sample lengths to show their fabrics. In
both instances the retailers’ stock inven-
tory is largely limited to these samples
from which orders are placed after the
sale is made.
With about 500 accounts throughout
Australia, all supplied with samples to
cover both media in selling, Greenwood
is able to secure an ever-increasing sales
volume. Stocks are kept in all capital
cities and retailers receive immediate
service after placing orders.
Fashion trends in furnishing fabrics
are currently influenced by Scan-
dinavian stylings, and the current prefer-
ence is for the wool-like acrylic fibres in
yarn-dyed effects woven into checks,
stripes, jacquards, and dobbys. One of
the dominant market trends is toward
the sheer or see-through fabrics in bril-
liant shot colors—peacock, rust-brown,
brilliant reds, etc. These are more
acceptable than heavy drapes, with the
greater quantity of glass now being used
in Australian homes.
Australian mills supply about 40 per-
cent of Greenwood’s requirements and
the balance is obtained overseas.

The company made one backward
step in 1962 with the acquisition of A.
Hall and Co. Ltd., operating two retail
furniture shops in Pitt Street, Sydney,
and Liverpool, a Sydney suburb, at a
market cost of $366,000. Hall’s Sydney
shop was closed down in May, 1965,
and the other store was closed in 1967.
Two acquisitions made in 1965 were to
take over tax-loss companies, which
effectively reduced the company’s tax
to pre-tax profit ratio.
Over the 1963-1967 period, Green-
wood’s sales in handbags increased by
32 percent and there was a jump of
49 percent in the furnishing fabric side
of the business. My information sug-
gests that in 1968 group sales and net
income will increase by over 10 percent
and the immediate future expectations
are very bright.
SUMMARY: At $1.02 the shares
command a dividend yield of 7.4 per-
cent and the price earnings multiple is
only 5.0. My advice would be to buy
at this price.

INTERESTING SITUATION
FOR PONGRASS
MINING EQUIPMENT
THE DEMAND for mining equipment
has never been greater; that, at least,
is one consequence of the mining boom.
So companies supplying that equip-
ment should stand to do pretty well.
One of them is Pongrass Industries, a
small three-year-old fledgling on the
Sydney Stock Exchange’s lists whose
shares are selling at almost six times
their par value, having risen 60 percent
since January.
Most of the rise took place in early
April, some time after the company had
made a moderately cheerful interim
announcement in March that spoke of
“slightly increased” profits for the first
half of the year and said that on the
strength of increased turnover in the
first two months of 1968, the second
half of the financial year was also ex-
pected to bring higher profits.
This suggests that the year just ended
will have been considerably better than
1966-67, when the main reason for the
company’s $45,000 net profit rise was
its lower tax bill because of tax losses
which have now run out.
At last October’s annual meeting the
chairman said that the company’s
engineering equipment had been
selected by mining companies in Wes-
tern Australia and other States for
some large installations, and the com-
pany was confident it would benefit to
a much greater extent in the future as
a result of the investment which the
mining industry was making in
Australia.
It was in expectation of much
increased activity in its engineering
operations (the company’s main.' divi-
sion) that stocks rose last year by a
massive 65 percent to almost $-| million
(or 1J times paid capital!), although
sales had gone up only 16 percent to
an unstated figure and debtors by 13
percent to $452,691 (against which, by
the way, there was a small provision of
only $9400, or 2 percent).
However, the latest rise in its shares
may well turn out to be at least a little
attributable to Pongrass’ tax problems
as well as its successes in the mining
field. For Pongrass must distribute
much more of its earnings following
its classification as a private company
for tax purposes, unless it can avoid
heavy retained profits tax. Last year,
for instance, Pongrass paid only $30,802
in dividends out of net profit of
$280,000. And even at the new higher
dividend rate of 12 percent (up one
percent on last year) and following last
year’s 1-for-10 bonus share issue, the
dividend would rise to only about
$37,000 in a full year.
The situation becomes all the more
intriguing for shareholders in that,
although Pongrass will be classified as
“private” for tax purposes (and there-
fore pay much lower initial tax) in
1967-68 as it was in 1966-67, the com-
pany expects to be restored to public
company status in the taxman’s eyes
by 1968-69, which will save the need
for distributing profits. But the prospect
of some form of additional distribution
to beat the taxman in the meantime
cannot be completely disregarded.
But the company has good internal
reasons for hanging on to as much cash
as it can. Its borrowings are very high,.
and the 1967 expansion meant that
despite its retained profits of $250,000,
liabilities nevertheless increased by
about $3500.
As a result, the company still looks
very under-capitalised, with borrowings
of $685,329 overwhelming capital of
$285,000 and helping to explain the
remarkable earnings rates the company
has achieved —last year’s was 94 per-
cent on capital. In terms of total funds
employed, however, the company’s
results have been much more modest,
but still very good, at percent in
1967.
Pongrass’ engineering division is
involved in many more areas than the
mining industry. The company makes
industrial pneumatics and high-precision
tube and pipe-bending machines, and is
Australian agent to “Aro” air-tools,
“Haskell” pumps, and distributes “Air
Champ” clutches and brakes. Its air-
power equipment, including air-power
valves, cylinders, filters, lubricators,
regulators, presses, and hoists, are sup-
plied to the full range of industry,
including steel mills and major motor
companies. The company has about
3000 customers.
As a natural extension from its tube
and pipe-bending machinery (which
was patented ten years ago) the com-
pany moved into tubular steel furni-
ture for home and office. This is a
rapidly expanding market, and Pon-
grass has moderate volume, making
about 1000 chairs a day. These are a
mass-produced article, and the margin
of profit is not as good as it used to be.
Namco, Sebels and 25 to 30 other
competitors make the prices keen.
The company also makes teak
dining-room furniture and office desks,
and contracts to Government and semi-
Government organisations for the
supply of furniture products.
The fibreglass division, boats, and
industrial fibreglass mouldings (includ-
ing industrial safety equipment and
electric components for the electrical
industry on a jobbing basis) represent
a minor part of the group’s business
these days, perhaps 5 to 10 percent.
The marine products section is on
three-quarters of an acre at Botany and
the main engineering factory is across
the road. Small buildings have been
demolished and some reorganisation
has taken place ir the manufacturing

area. There are also plants in Chelten-
ham (Vic.) and Hendra (Qld.).
Import restrictions in New Zealand
forced the company to set up a joint
50 percent-owned manufacturing opera-
tion there for pneumatic equipment.
Exports so far are small but definitely
on the increase, with the managing-
director currently overseas drumming
up business in Canada. In the past, the
company has exported to the U.S.A.,
Philippines, Malaysia, New Zealand,
and Japan, which is a measure of its
technical excellence.
Pongrass entered the public lists in
Sydney through the back door only
three years ago by the purchase of
G. H. Sears. Its first declared profit
was $346,218 before providing $20,000
for plant replacement.
It calculated tax at public company
rates, but because of Sears’ tax losses
it only charged $19,750 against profits.
However, it created a taxation reserve
at that time by appropriating $157,100
of profits, although it did not expect
this would be assessed as payable. In
1967 it added a further $15,000 to that
reserve.
Had these tax appropriations been
chargeable against profits, the trend in
net results would be $189,000 in 1966,
$235,000 in 1967, and $265,000 in 1968.
As a result of recent amendments to tax
legislation, all 15 companies in the
group are capable of being classed for
tax purposes as private companies, so
tax provision in 1966 and 1967 has
been calculated at private company-
rates of 271 percent on the first $lO,OOO
profit, and percent on the excess,
which is quite a saving on public com-
pany rates of 421 percent.
To be restored to public company
status, the shares have to be spread
further. Another bonus issue may
achieve it. There were no tax losses
in 1966, but some in 1967 (probably
from the Bettachrome subsidiary and
which were exhausted by 1967 balance
date) enabled the group to pay tax at
the rate of only 21 percent to pre-tax
profit. The latest year should see tax
at normal private company rates, which
would have reduced 1967’s profit by
$50,000-odd.
The company is likely to acquire
other companies in future, with an eye
to tax losses, if not for expansion.
Dividends in the first two years of
its public life were ten percent, then 11
percent, and currently it is on a 12-
percent rate since the interim payment
of six percent, following slightly in-
creased earnings for the first half of
the year just ended. The extraordinarily
high earning rate in relation to capital
was a factor in the company declaring
a one-for-ten bonus in October, 1967,
from revaluation of the shares in sub-
sidiary companies, and it is obvious
the company intends to make further
bonus issues at appropriate times,
although there may be also some
interest in reducing the huge goodwill
content in the accounts of $416,507.
The company owed nearly $400,000
to the vendors (the Pongrass family
interest) at last balance date, and at
the rate of $lOO,OOO a year should be
free of this liability three years from
now.
In three years’ time, if mining and
other business keeps up, the company
could have developed beyond recogni-
tion. Although a good deal of its
growth is already discounted in the
present market valuation, the company
is in an interesting situation.

THE LAND
Sugar’s super-optimists
HOPE SEEMS to spring eternal on all
kinds of commodity agreements. And
those for primary products furnish no
exception. Australian farmers last week
heard great optimism spread over the
commencement of the new Inter-
national Grains Arrangement. They
also, perhaps rather to their surprise,
were provided with relative cheer on the
possibility of the attainment of an in-
ternational sugar agreement.
The chairman of the Wheat Board,
Dr. A. R. Callaghan, may very well
be right in thinking that world wheat
markets can achieve a reasonable
stability and that the arrangement has
begun to remove “the excessive bearish
pressures which had been generated by
its opponents to stop it coming into
operation.” Dr. Callaghan went even
further in enthusiasm by remarking:
“Its operation transcends all the fac-
tors of immediate concern to the inter-
national marketing of wheat crops.”
Some of the domestic price-support
techniques practised, for instance, by
the United States and Canada before
the arrangement began formally to rule
on July 1, might cause one to wonder
whether the situation can be so clear
so early price increases and all.
But at least there’s a signed document
laying down guidelines and able to be
policed.
Sugar doesn’t appear to be approach-
ing anywhere near such a situation,
despite the “substantial” hopes ex-
pressed by the Minister for Primary
Industry, Mr. J. D. Anthony, on his
return from the failed-and-deadlocked
Geneva talks. “The factors of immedi-
ate concern” at present look somewhat
too big to be easily transcended.
Indeed, Mr. Anthony gave every evi-
dence of whistling in the wind of his
own list of obstacles in hopefully
declaring: “We finally got closer to an
agreement than I had expected.” These
main points of disagreement were fully
apparent when the UN - sponsored
sugar conference actually broke down
early in June. Subsequent consultations
among the executive committee, which
finished on July 1, have done little by
way of resolution or compromise. Now
the main responsibility lies in the con-
ference sub-committees, which remain
active, and in “private” consultations.
It is planned to resume full talks again
on September 23, and the super-opti-
mists are reckoning on winning a new
International Sugar Agreement to be-
come operative on January 1, 1969.
Three principal obstacles were men-
tioned by Mr. Anthony, and weighty
ones they turn out to be. They com-
prise:
• The opposition of sugar exporters
from the Common Market countries.
• Opposition from the Communist
countries re-exporting Cuban sugar.
• Disagreement among the exporting
countries on the size and distribution
of the residual market for sugar sold
at the (unestablished) world price.
It is evident, on any predictable
world production-consumption pattern,
that the big producers must either re-
duce production or export less. Here
Australian output tendencies enter the
argument straightaway. The whole
trend of Australia’s sugar industry in
recent years has unashamedly been
toward increasing output. This has led
to considerable strains within the in-
dustry and greatly expanded Govern-
ment aid to cushion a probably un-
economic size. Not without reason are
some countries branding Australia’s
continually expanding output as a “sin.”
There is still every necessity that
any overall rural inquiry, in the light
of this overproduction, should deeply
concern itself with the economics, sub-
sidising, and rationalising of sugar
notwithstanding the relatively small
proportion of the local crop which is
sold at free-market prices.
Any such inquiry will, of course, be
in the teeth of most of the growers,
who still see their overseas sales (other
than those now subject to special agree-
ment) with too rosy an optimism. As
recently as May 30, at an Ingham field-
day, Mr. M. J. McAvoy, chairman of
the Queensland Cane Growers’ Council
and president of the National Farmers’
Anthony ...closer than expected
Union, enthused about the 25 percent
increase in productivity in recent years,
capping this with, “Instead of 25 per-
cent, we will be looking to doubling
productivity.”
Mr. McAvoy, at the same gathering
and without relating the two statements,
also said: “On the marketing side of the
industry we have an over-dependence
on the free world market, and this
poses many problems.”
AGRISEARCH
SAFFLOWER SUCCESSES
WITHIN THE PAST few years it has
been realised that some varieties of
safflower yield an oil that can be used as
an adulterant or substitute for the more
expensive olive oil. Spain and Portugal
are now becoming very interested in
this crop. The Indians, of course, have
always recognised the value of safflower
as a high-quality cooking-oil. Medical
research tends to support their native
shrewdness. Safflower oil consists
mainly of unsaturated fatty acids
which, when eaten, lower the level of
cholesterol in the blood stream. Choles-
terol is believed to be responsible for
hardening of the arteries, and hence
high blood pressure, heart attacks, and
other diseases of the circulatory
system.
Edible vegetable oils are in short
supply everywhere, but the Western
World first became seriously interested
in safflower during World War II when
supplies of drying oils needed for muni-
tions, paints, varnishes, and other vital
industrial purposes were running short.
Australia and the U.S.A. turned to
safflower as a possible replenishment
source, but the war stopped before the
crop became established in either
country on a large commercial scale.
However, energetic plant - breeding
programs continued under Dr. Carl
Clausen, at the University of California,
and the late Dr. B. Horowitz, at the
Waite Research Institute, Adelaide.
Both sought high-yielding, high-oil-
content varieties. Both were very suc-
cessful. In addition, Dr. Horowitz
developed a strain that was free of the
typical thistle spines, but had to sacrifice
oil content to some extent. Subse-
quently, neither farmers nor stock have
found prickles to be a serious obstacle,
and so the variety called after Dr.
Horowitz is now largely replaced by
the spiny, Californian variety, Gila,
which is a better oil producer.
This variety resembles saffron thistle
(Carthamus lanatus), which has become
a serious weed in Australia. However,
although safflower is an aggressive rooter
there is no danger that it will become

Commonwealth Inquiry
Into
SALARIES IN COLLEGES
OF ADVANCED EDUCATION
An Inquiry has been initiated by the Commonwealth Minister for Education and
Science to enquire into salaries in colleges of advanced education. Persons and
organisations who wish to place information or make representations before the
Inquiry regarding the aspects of salaries in colleges which are the subject of
the Inquiry are invited to do so.
The Inquiry will be assisted if persons and organisations who wish to place
information or make representations prepare written submissions setting out in
detail the information and related material they wish the Inquiry to consider.
These written submissions should be forwarded to the Secretary, Inquiry into Salaries
in Colleges of Advanced Education, P.O. Box 826, Canberra City, A.C.T. 2601,
before 15th July, 1968. Any material clearly marked "Confidential" will be treated
as confidential by the Inquiry.
In forwarding their written submissions, persons and organisations shoujd indicate
whether they wish to speak to their written submissions before the Inquiry. As far
as is practicable, opportunity will be provided for them to do so. It is expected
that the Inquiry will be visiting all States over the next few months and the
Secretary will advise persons who wish to speak to their submissions of the date
and place at which they may attend to do so.
The Inquiry has been appointed with the following terms of reference
"To advise on salaries of lecturer and senior lecturer in
colleges of advanced education, having regard to present
levels of academic and professional salaries in Australia,
with a view to such advice being used by the Commonwealth
Advisory Committee on Advanced Education as the basis for
recommending grants for colleges of advanced education.
K. E. CREECH,
SECRETARY.
a menace, because it spends a long time
in the rosette stage and is readily over-
grown by other plants. In fact, one of
the main hazards in safflower growing
is that weeds will get ahead of the crop
during its slow growth stage and suf-
focate it. Later, when the weather
warms up, the stems elongate rapidly
and the crop can put competitors in
the shade. Another critical period
occurs after flowering. Even vigorous
plants will not set seed if they suffer
any lack of water. For this reason the
Californians are turning to irrigation.
Most of the American crop is grown
on the west side of the warm San
Joaquin Valley where yields have
varied widely from season to season,
but with irrigation water now available
to these growers it is hoped that the
harvest will stabilise between 70 and
80 bushels an acre. But irrigation, too,
is risky unless the soil is suitable and
great care is taken, because safflower
is highly likely to develop root rot if
the soil stays too moist. The N.S.W.
crop failed last year for this reason.
Twelve years ago the safflower crop
in Queensland amounted to a mere 44
bushels. Last year it topped a million
bushels and comprised almost the entire
Australian production. The Central
Queensland Highlands seem destined to
become the main safflower area, but
good crops can also be raised on the
suitable soils of the Darling Downs and
in the Callide and Dawson Valleys.
Average long-term yield for the State
is 12 bushels, but the trend is upward.
The Ord River area also seems to be
suitable. Excellent crops have been
grown there in the dry season under
irrigation. Yields have compared
favorably with those of the San
Joaquin.
Pretty nearly the whole Australian
crop is used for edible oil. Marrick-
ville Margarine is by far the biggest
consumer, but the demand for safflower
oil for domestic cooking is growing
strongly. At present more than half
Australia’s edible oil is imported. The
safflower crop could expand consider-
ably, therefore, before filling the home
market, and good possibilities for export
exist. Growers are getting $9B a ton
for clean seed delivered in Sydney. At
this price, farmers in suitable areas can
make more from safflower than from
wheat. There is no reason either why
safflower should not find a more impor-
tant place in stock feeding. Trials by the
Queensland Department of Primary In-
dustries have shown that safflower is a
better grazing proposition than oats in
the Brigalow Development Areas and in
the Central Highlands. Pig and poultry
feeds could be based on safflower in
future. Dr. C. G. Payne, University of
Sydney, has produced a very satisfac-
tory diet for broilers by adding a little
fish meal to crushed safflower. Many
pigs and dairy cattle in the U.S. are
reared on safflower meal. Pacific
Safflower Pty. Ltd., Sydney, handles
the Australian crop and Mr. J. Harbi-
son, Queensland Department of Prim-
ary Industries, can supply further in-
formation.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
From a pasture for posterity
by GEORGE FARWELL
WHEN Campbelltown truckie Keith
Longhurst takes off this week down
the mountain behind Minto, N.S.W.,
in the semi-trailer he calls “Flying
Debris,” he will be in charge of the
weightiest art convoy ever to roll along
Australian highways. To meet a dead-
line in Canberra, sculptor Tom Bass
has been obliged to commission three
road transports to carry a massive
creation in copper from his hilltop
assembly point to the nearly completed
National Library. The sculpture weighs
three tons and is 70ft. long.
Not that it fazes Longhurst. He was
the laconic jehu who took the same
sculptor’s now-celebrated bronze Ethos
across to the Federal capital in 1961,
then directed the crane operators to
swing it into place in Civic Place while
a knot of highly paid public servants,
the official receivers, stood innocuously
by. Eighteen months ago he drove
another Bass colossus in copper up to
Brisbane, where it now stands outside
the Queen Street offices of the Manu-
factures Mutual Insurance Co. “No
trouble,” he says. “I just sit in the
truck and tune my backside in and keep
going.”
The operation is not quite so simple
at Tom Bass’ end. He has been two
years designing and fabricating this
great work in welded and beaten copper
for the National Library. “It’s bigger
than an F-lll,” he says. “And, I might
add, cheaper. Also, it needs no spares.”
The bigger problem—a common com-
plaint of artists —was to complete it in
so short a time.
Bass was approached two years ago
by architects Bunning and Madden,
who wanted him to decorate a 70ft.-
wide blank space above the National
Library’s entrance doors. What could
he do? Well, sculptors don’t just
decorate. He had to have a theme. To
Tom Bass this was an important build-
ing. It had to symbolise its purpose.
“When I was sitting in Walter Bun-
ning’s office,” he said, “one of those
strange intuitive things happened. I
thought suddenly of some of the ancient
Sumerian art I had seen. Their main
symbol was a winged sun. It was their
symbol for god; they had another repre-
senting a sacred tree, maybe the tree
of life. I decided to link the two in my
design. Then on the left-hand side I
added a representation of the Ark,
which, I felt, was a kind of storehouse
of knowledge and experience. I designed
this in a 70ft. panel which will extend
across the entrance doors.”
Simple enough to talk about; not so
simple to set in place. It will take at
least seven days, putting the final touch
to a building due to be opened on
August 14. There was also considerable
labor involved in fashioning the thing
on Cowpasture Hill, Minto, where Tom
Bass has his home and workshop over-
looking one of the most lyrical expanses
of countryside left in the outer Sydney
area.
Bass is a modern sculptor who puzzles
the more conventional viewer. For one
thing, he is not an operator who chips
away with hammer and chisel at blocks
of stone or marble. He has always been
fascinated by metals. For some years he
was working in the most extraordinary
Emmett-like fashion with acid baths and
electrolytic methods, incomprehensible
to lay observers. Now he uses sheet
copper, bought from industrial pro-
ducers in rolls, cuts out sections as re-
quired on factory lines, assembles them
on a steel framework, and beats them
into the shape and the final subtleties
of texture required.
Though he has built a large studio
on to his house, the place is too small
for these outsize works, so the Library
mural has been fabricated in the open
air. Even so, it has to be cut into three
segments for trucking to Canberra. He
worked from small-scale models: first,
he moulded his design in plaster, then
expanded it to a second one, one-eighth
the final size. From this his full-time
assistant, Kevin Goodridge, assembled
copper sheets, cut out three-dimensional
patterns as the couturier makes a
dress (or a shipbuilder a ship), then
translated the result into so many cubic
feet of sheet copper. The end result
depends as much on Kevin as the
Sculptor Tom Bass with his three-ton,
70ft.-long sculpture for the National
Library, Canberra . . . “cheaper than an
F-III, needs no spares”
creator. And Kevin, as Tom Bass says,
is a dedicated man, “passionately inter-
ested in the work we’re doing.”
Kevin Goodridge was a coppersmith
who went to a trades school, then
worked in a factory producing water-
heaters, stainless-steel tanks, and other
products. “In this corrugated-iron cul-
ture of ours,” says Bass, “it’s remark-
able how a couple of blokes like us
could come around to working to-
gether.” He has now so many com-
missions he has been able to put his
coppersmith on the payroll full-time.
The sculptor’s biggest problem right
now is sleep. He has been working from
sun-up to dark each day to keep his
National Library deadline, then going
over to his large and cluttered studio
for a second commission that must be
finished by mid-August. This is a huge,
free-standing coat of arms for the nearly
finished Australian Chancery building
in Washington.
The sculptured clay stands 9ft. high.
It is not by any means a conventional


affair, though he has had to observe
government protocol and heraldic
design. But what he has done to that
old roo and emu you’d hardly believe.
This is an artist’s conception of our
national pets we are now so busy
destroying, and the huge clay design has
a free-flowing and contemporary air.
This, too, has to be transported
interstate next month, for the bronze
casting is to be done in Melbourne, then
shipped to the U.S. “What I’m inter-
ested in are not old-fashioned types of
sculpture,” Bass says, “but its civic
application today.” Anyone who knows
his superb Socrates in Melbourne Uni-
versity’s Wilson Hall, the religious
sculptures in Yass, and many other
abstract works in copper and bronze
around the country will recognise that
he is no artist to potter around with
provincial statuary.
MELLOWED SATIRE
THEATRE/ROBERT WARD
BARRY HUMPHRIES has returned
with “Just Another Show,” but it’s
more than that, really. It opens with a
screened take-off of the Twentieth
Century-Fox logo and fanfare. From
the stalls Edna Everage appears, chat-
ting with the audience, searching for
her seat, and finally making her way
to the stage, where she sings “All things
bright and beautiful . . . Australia
makes them all.” It is the familiar
routine, and yet somehow Edna has
changed since she was last in Australia.
She would say mellowed. No longer the
great mauve goddess of Australian
suburbia, she has become a friendly old
soap-opera character, perhaps from
“Martin’s Corner.”
Sandy Stone also displays the passage
of time, sitting meekly in his wheel-
chair after having an “op in the Repat’s
Blarney Ward.” He reminisces, talks
about retirement and the need of good
friends. He is Humphries’ most brilliant
and pathetic creation, a simple-minded,
altogether decent suburban man who
finds the inanities of his life both
satisfying and utterly exhausting.
Humphries himself seems to have
mellowed along with Edna and Sandy.
His satire is more gently ironic, less
aggressive, and demanding. “Lionel
Stephen Denis Hunter” is a hippy with
John Lennon hair, beads, and spangles,
who would have left to join his guru
if it were not for his parents, who worry
him, hooked as they are to alcohol and
golf. The English migrant in “Pomme
Frite” is returning home because
“Coronation Street” and “Peyton Place”
are three years behind out here. “Big
Sonia” is a folksinger for whom pro-
testing is a way of life. Martin Agrippa
is a maker of underground films and an
expert in carefully articulated cultural
nonsense.
These characters are just slightly
larger than life, and their cliches are
just as absurd or banal as those
found in Edna’s and Sandy’s worlds.
Humphries likes them and patronises
them. The audience watches expectantly
as he rummages through many of their
most dearly held values to display them
as amusingly outmoded or unreal, and
then applauds frantically.
There are only two pieces where he
puts in the satirical boot. In “Rex Lear
Requests the Pleasure” he plays a
boorish, self-made Toorak father at his
daughter’s wedding reception, unable
to talk of anything other than how
much it’s all costing and of how his
daughter’s friends can’t stand his man-
ners. He asks for the bill from the
Barry as Edna
Italian caterer, and then launches an
attack on him with every stock anti-
Southern European insult his Australian
bar-room patois can muster. In “Brian
Graham,” a young, blond-haired execu-
tive of a family fertiliser business is
skilfully in control, surrounded by tele-
phones. He talks briskly to a client,
entirely the man of commerce and
decision-making techniques. Then to his
father, more relaxed, he displays com-
mand of complex technical detail.
The third conversation is glib and
insinuating as he talks to an “under-
standing” heterosexual friend. Then,
finally, effeminate and grossly camp, he
speaks to a dress-designer friend. When
his father rings back on another line,
the strain of keeping the two conversa-
tions going simultaneously is too great.
He slams down both receivers and
vomits. We see that Edna’s world is a
long way from this.
Edna finishes the show by gently
sending-up the audience, to whom she
throws bunches of gladioli and en-
courages to join in a spot of com-
munity singing. The song is a new
national anthem in which Edna has
made the “glad” a national floral em-
blem. The audience joins in, waving
gladioli, and is suddenly projected
into the actuality of Edna’s world. It’s
a pointed joke played on an unsuspect-
ing audience, and Humphries enjoys
every moment of it.
BRAVELY TO WAR
THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
Oh, What a Lovely War. St. Martin’s
Theatre, Melbourne.
CHARLES CHILTON, Joan Little-
wood, and the London Theatre Work-
shop share the credit for this theatrical
collage, but the real authors were the
original cast —the brass and other ranks
of the Great War. The memoirs and
personal recollections of Wilhelm 11,
Joffre, Haigh, Ledendorff, and the rest
provide a narrative as droll and loony
as anything of Joseph Haller’s or Jaro-
self Hasek’s. And the songs, full of the
humor and irony that held off madness,
wafted up with the stench from the
trenches.
A cast of ten men and four women
in pierrot costumes play all parts. In
tin helmets they’re the armies, and in
scarves and cloth caps they’re the
civilians of Britain, France, and Ger-
many. With fragments of tunics they
become nurses and generals, and in
bandages they represent the 30,000,000
casualties.
The cast is reinforced by a rear-
projection screen, which presents old
photographs, newspaper cuttings, and
posters, while the statistics of the
carnage appear above them. There are
sound-effects, a few puffs of smoke, and
in the pit a small orchestra plays the
songs with Kurt Weill dissonance that,
while largely accidental, is wholly
appropriate.
This production, which began its life
in London as an improvisation, is now
strictly formalised. The actors’ tricks
derive from the theories of Brecht’s epic,
theatre and the production devices are
borrowed from television documentary.
To succeed, it needs to be played at full
revue pitch so as to bombard the audi-
ence with sound and image, emotion
and information. On opening night the
pace often lagged and some of the cast
lacked conviction. But this is an enor-
mously complex production and will
probably gain confidence and tempo as
the season progresses.
A few years ago a production of this
type would have been unthinkable at
St. Martin’s, a theatre identified with
conservative productions of timid plays.
Now the theatre has unloosed its whale-
bones and is fighting hard for new
audiences. This has meant taking great
financial risks, none greater than this
production. For St. Martin’s gets no
subsidies, and a theatre without a sub-
sidy is like a trapeze act without a net.
Bluntly, St. Martin’s can’t afford a
bad season, and that knowledge places
an intolerable strain on its producers.
Yet while the Victorian Government
ignores this important theatre Mel-
bourne’s counterpart to Doris Fitton’s
Independent—sl37,ooo is given away
in indiscriminate- handouts to over 100
cultural organisations, ranging from
Carols by Candlelight to the Quam-
batook Music and Dramatic Club. As
strategies go, that seems as foolish as
anything of Field-Marshal Haigh’s.

MAMMON ON SUNDAY
THE ABC goes into a new field this
week with its first radio finance pro-
gram. Until now, through all the excite-
ments of mineral discoveries and stock-
market booms, the ABC has confined its
coverage to share prices, read with the
same drama as market reports and
river heights. The program, which
began July 7, is presented by Michael
Baume at the unearthly hour of 8.35 on
Sunday mornings on the second net-
work.
He wanted to call the session “The
Mammon Program,” but the ABC
wouldn’t have that. At any rate, listeners
will have High Mass at St. Mary’s, a
couple of sermons, and other sober
programming to dampen their
enthusiasm before the market reopens.
ASTIR IN BRISBANE
IF WE ARE to believe American art
critic Clement Greenberg, there is no
such thing as an instant, just-add-new-
blood-and-serve cultural revolution, but
there have been three significant
boosters to the Brisbane art scene in
the past weeks.
The Marcel Duchamp exhibition
from the Mary Sisler collection was
shown at the State Gallery, rather to
the surprise of director Wieneke’s de-
tractors and to the ribald delight of
the Brisbane Press. But the stultified
approach to display was disappointing
to anyone who had seen the exhibition
in Sydney. Ready-mades, like the snow
shovel, were tacked, bulge outwards, on
white grounds instead of hanging free.
Mr. Wieneke said they were unable to
follow Duchamp’s hanging instructions
to the letter “because some people
were likely to give them a push.”
But Duchamp made it here, which
is the main thing, and the gallery was
open until 8 p.m. (first time) on three
nights to let office workers study a
Remington on a pedestal.
And Greenberg made it, too, for the
Power memorial lecture on “Avant-
garde Attitudes” he delivered in all
capital cities. For the practical enthusi-
asts, the seminar at the university the
following morning was more worth
while. He accompanied 68 slides of
“now” New York art, starting with the
roots grown by Jackson Pollock, with
comments, sometimes incisive, more
often than not indefinite, personal (“I
find this one, er, agreeable”).
Critics and exhibitions come and go,
but some gallery owners, so it seems,
simply lie dormant awhile. Last week,
when people had ceased even to scan
classifieds under “Galleries — death
of,” suddenly there was Brian John-
stone again, beaming previewers into
the first exhibition at his galleries in
six months. The main reason for the
recess, he said, was to fit out a lush new
collectors’ gallery downstairs, specially
designed for those who come to open-
ings with more than boggle eyes and
a thirst.
Plans are also well under way for a
permanent home for Twelfth Night
Theatre on ex-Johnstone land next to
the galleries, and building is expected
to begin around October. Johnstone
and Twelfth Night director Joan
Whalley hope to combine the pleasure
of sauntering through a gallery with an
evening’s drama to realise, for Bris-
bane people, what they perceive as a
natural affinity between the two arts.
WRITING TO SELL
WRITING books for a specific market
is not every author’s idea of art, but
the recent Professional Writers’ Seminar
in Melbourne was advised by one
speaker to do just that. Clues to the
market? John Michie, head of Aus-
tralian Penguins, said his firm’s top-
sellers here were the physical fitness
books “5-BX” and “10-BX,” “The
Lucky Country,” “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover,” and “The Group” in that
order.
THE BOOMERANG TRAIL
AUSTRALIA’S feature film industry
might not quite be reviving in the style
some of its young acolytes hoped for
when they dreamed of an antipodean
“school” arising from the remnants of
a bygone Ealing. The revival, certain if
slow, is still being generated by foreign
money and planning, and the subservi-
ence to the box-office is a little too
obvious to satisfy cineastes who see
Australia as more than just another
cinematically pretty country. But films
are being made again after years of
promises, promises. The latest to be
scheduled for production this year is a
historical drama with the strangely apt
title “Return Of the Boomerang” in
which Ajax Films will combine with
American Louis F. Edelman. Shooting
is due to start in N.S.W. in November.
Edelman, a former president of the
American Guild of Screen Producers,
has been planning the film for years.
It has undergone a number of changes
of locale and scriptwriters since he con-
ceived the idea during a wartime
acquaintance with Devil’s Island, and
now has an American writer (Dick
Fielder), an English director (Phillip
Leacock), and an Australian setting
(circa 1830s). It will be about an
American convict who marries an Eng-
lish convict girl and their tribulations
after they take up land. The leads will
be cast overseas, but Edelman will bring
only a minimum number of technicians
and hopes to have all the processing of
the film done in Australia.

INTRIGUING SOBRIETY
ART/ELWYN LYNN
Design in Scandinavia. N.S.W. Art Gal-
lery, Sydney.
COOL AND SOBER elegance, the
catalogue notes tell us, is the feature
of Scandinavian design; certainly it does
not signal as emphatically as the
Bauhaus and Constructivist artifacts
that it is design. As with humans,
Scandinavian design is most efficient
when it’s sober; its sobriety seems so
natural when you recall Constructiv-
ism’s over-concern with form’s follow-
ing function, a catch-cry that obscures
two matters: it assumes that we might
be confused about what good design
is, but we know all about the functions
of objects; and, secondly, that good
design is perfect design. All design
remains experimental, and though a
heavy iron casserole, enamelled in
bright red or deep blue, may cook meat
to juicy tenderness, it’s awkward to
wash up.
Design long ago raised the issue
of whether art that is repeated, as in
graphics, is in some way impure, but
modern Scandinavian designers have
concerned themselves with a more
practical issue about replicas: good
design ought to be cheap enough to
be expendable. Oscar Wilde’s anxiety
was to live up to his Blue China, but
our anxiety is about breaking desirable
artifacts and we tend to turn their
function into that of works of art, to
be contemplated. Now, however, you
can buy cheap, pressed tumblers with
subtly slanted lips, smoky grey, trans-
parent plastic bowls (that snobbishly
incline to imitate glass), or semi-opaque,
red plastic trays that take advantage
of the easy, curvaceous moulding of
which plastic is -capable. Such pieces,
the jewellery, ceramics, stainless-steel
ware, furniture, cubes of glass (bubbles
inserted) for walls, buoys, lamps, and
tapestries are stimulatingly displayed;
but the objects are not overstimulating.
The Scandinavians intrigue rather
than animate; one admires how well
wooden and steel folding stools close
in homage to the Scandinavian need for
symmetry. A bowl, the firm, heavy,
silver necklaces, the module furniture
for children’s rooms (children can
assemble it), saucepans and lamps
exhibit a self-sufficient, happy sym-
metry. There is an equipoise, found
elsewhere in reading lamps and sauce-
pans, between the spurt of a coffee pot’s
spout and its down-thrusting handle.
These features are connected with
good design’s reliance on the predictable
silhouette; unlike sculpture and in-
dividual pottery, one view of design
implies that the other is much the same
and all is revealed in a few glances.
The decoration on a bulbous ceramic
jar repeats itself endlessly; the design
on a chair is dead centre, and to reject
finally the notion that art is the un-


expected, the copper handle on the
splendidly robust iron pots by Antti
Nurmesniem will repeat the curve of
the lid.
There is, however, a civilised revolt
against the gravity, sobriety, and sym-
metry of crisp jugs, coffee cups, and
large, flat, bleached ceramic platters.
Formerly, designers told manufacturers
how vulgar and inefficient their pro-
ducts were, then, learned in the prin-
ciples of good design, the manufacturers
lectured the designers; now designers,
reproving their fellows on the sterility
of austerity, are reinstating whimsy and
clutter. One asymmetrical glass dish
wanders where it wishes; under the
influence of Pop-Art, Erik Hoglund
bands the stems of his beverage glasses
with gay stripes, and Bertil Vallien, who
is leading the opposition to orthodox
good design, makes tall, wrinkled glass
vases in burnt wood moulds, gives
square glass bottles four decorated
breasts at the top corners, and smothers
a vase with shapes of fresh fruit. Though
these innovations remain cool, they
point up an outstanding feature of the
exhibition: sobriety does not necessarily
mean puritanism.
A VISUAL "LEAR"
THEATRE/REX CRAMFHORNE
King Lear. Shakespeare. Old Tote
Theatre Company, Sydney.
I SAW “King Lear” on Monday night
with a capacity audience of school-
children. Whether Shakespeare can be
made to appeal to schoolchildren and
what their response is to a play like
“King Lear” are matters of the most
complete indifference to me. Simply, I
should prefer to see one of the rare
large-scale productions of Shakespeare
in Australia without the distorting
influence of such an audience.
The plot-line linking Lear’s appear-
ances requires unusual strength and
intensity in performance if the whole
enormous concept of the play is to' be
animated: on Monday night Edmund
lost his lines in Act 1, Scene 2 (the
beginning of an unfortunate series of
accidents), and concentration, in both
audience and cast, was severely shaken.
The resultant shapelessness of this per-
formance (audiences quite often get the
performances they deserve) did not
obscure the fact that Robin Lovejoy’s
production makes its greatest impact
in all the most difficult and contro-
versial parts of the play. Ron Graham’s
Lear, Barry Lovett’s Fool, and the
whole central concept of the collapse
of natural order were all vividly
realised.
The most obviously novel aspect of
the production is its visual style. Yoshi
Tosa’s design provides the play with a
non-specific setting of rock-like struc-
tures which prove tactfully functional
as thrones and hovels and define a
three-dimensional spacial area in which
to achieve some interesting and mean-
ingful movement. However, the stage
is also provided with an apron-like ex-
tension in an effort to bring the action
out into the chilly void of the Science
Theatre auditorium. When in use this
seems to me to leave the monoliths
looking like a set of rather unattractive
ornaments, and when not in use the
extension only separates us further from
the action. The “primitive” leather and
wool costumes adequately represent the
curious blend of “years of the world
3105” (as Holinshead dates Lear’s
accession) and somewhat Roman sound
of the “centurys” and “cohorts” of the
text.
But, much more often, the text has
an Elizabethan-contemporary sphere of
reference from gloves and gauntlets,
pockets and plackets, nether-stocks and
worsted-stockings to concepts like
justice, duty, and the “order” of the
universe, all of which direct our atten-
tion to the very unprimitive nature of
the play’s themes. I was left with the
feeling that a strictly maintained visual
style had been forced on to the play
from outside instead of being allowed
to develop from within.
Similarly, I felt that several charac-
terisations were being forced on to the
lines provided by Shakespeare vixen-
Goneril, tiger-Regan, and Thring-
Cornwall were like a too-easy coloring-
in, while Gloucester and his family, on
the other hand, barely achieved an out-
line of character and left the sub-plot
looking rather mechanical
The sounds (designed by Richard
Meale) established a convention that
was always adhered to but not always
a success. The storm sound could
hardly have been better, and the per-
cussion resonances were often good
when allied to emotional or intellectual
responses but too frequently used at
the ends of scenes (and coupled with
invariable lighting fades down and then
up) they began to emphasise the frag-
mented, episodic nature of a plot whose
interest was being somewhat sketchily
maintained. The staging of the battle,
which followed the script exactly, in-
volved the use of the extras in a short
alarum and retreat. I found myself
wondering whether the battle sound
might not, like the storm sound, have
been enough alone, especially as the
script’s introduction of the blind
Gloucester as the only witness of the
battle seems to give ample warrant for
such a treatment of the scene. More-
over, the sword-fighting, in general, was
rather tentative, as a school audience is
eager to point out.
Ultimately, “King Lear” is Lear and
the production is triumphantly right in
that department. The end of Act 2,
culminating in a wonderful off-stage
“to horse” and the beginnings of the
“wild night” on the heath, is probably
the most exciting moment of the even-
ing, though Ron Graham never fails to
fulfil the promise of this early scene
and gives us a “madness” which con-
tains all the play’s sense. If, at the end,
I felt that his performance had been a
little less moving than I had expected,
I was bound to acknowledge that his
audience had hardly been in a mood to
be moved.
BRINGING BACK THE FUN
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
THE PHENOMENON known as the
concert party, which lasted as a going
concern until the 19305, is still seen
in rather depressed circumstances in
free Sunday afternoon concerts and
groups which habitually make the
Riverina-run for country music clubs.
In the Attic Chamber Ensemble’s line-
up are the traditional stalwarts: singer,
flautist, violinist, cellist, and somebody
at the keyboard; but a touch of the
exotic spoils the atmosphere of the palm
court, for the keyboard, at this concert
in the Sydney Town Hall, anyway, be-
longed to a harpsichord and there was
also a viola. The Attic Ensemble is
the Musica Viva’s indigenous offering
for 1968, and the homely and faded
antecedents of this group are com-
pletely belied by the staridards of music
they perform and the quality of their
performance.
Lauris Elms, who opened the concert
with an oddly designated Sacred Con-
certo by Giovanni Battista Riccio, has a
voice which demands an “in” word from
the 1930 s to describe it gorgeous.
This item and the arias from C. H.
Graun’s “Montezuma” which followed
were vocally sumptuous, and it was no
wonder that the strings involuntarily,
and probably unstylistically, widened
their vibrato to cope with the golden
sound of the soloist. The decorations in
the arias were handled with virtuoso
ease, and one spectacular essay ran
through the singer’s range without a sus-
picion of the change of gear so apparent
in most contraltos.
It was in the middle, purely instru-
mental, section of the program that the
rewards were not as great as they should
have been. Beethoven’s D Major Sere-
nade for Flute, Violin, and Viola was
played accurately and stylishly, but I
missed the sparkle that can lift this
work from the ranks of occasional music
into realms of pure delight. In the
Leclair Sonata, which followed, the im-
maculate soloist was Robert Pikler and
the term soloist, as used advisedly for
the harpsichord, despite its impressive
physical proportions, was largely in-
audible. The viola is not an aggressive
instrument normally, but when played by
Mr. Pikler it loses its Cinderella charac-
ter and becomes a source of opulent
sound. Probably, using a cello to double
the bass line would have improved
matters: as it was, the performance
lacked rhythmic bite,
Here was a concert which could have
well sounded like a thorough-going
hotchpotch, but was, in fact, both enter-
taining and integrated. The success of
this venture could lead to a return of
diversity in concert programs, for
although no one wishes for performing
dogs or songs by Arditi between move-
ments of major works, hazards with
which even Chopin had to contend,
our programming these days is inclined
to be stuffy, and a lot of fun has gone
out of music as a consequence.


The influence
of a Lindsay
“Three Girls " of Broken Hill ponder the problem of their futures
PAUL DELPRAT, great-grandson of
Julian Ashton, founder of the Sydney
Art School, is dedicated to figurative
painting. His opinion of the abstract
movement is unequivocal “decadent,
appealing to the intellect rather than
the emotions. All the great movements
in art have been concerned with the
representation of the human body
they’re the ones with the most warmth
of feeling.” This outlook and his friend-
ship with Norman Lindsay made him a
logical choice when Michael Powell, the
British producer, was searching for an
artist to paint the pictures used in the
film version of Lindsay’s novel, “Age
of Consent.” Delprat, who is 26, went
on location with the film unit to Dunk
Island, where he had to paint to the
requirements of the film’s shooting
schedule.
Some Dunk Island paintings he did
for himself were included in his recent
exhibition at the Bonython Galleries
in Sydney. But primarily it is made up
of a set of paintings woven round the

history of Broken Hill. Delprat’s grand-
father, .Guillaume Delprat, was once
manager of BHP, and prompted by
information gathered from family
records the artist decided to go to
Broken Hill last year and begin a
painterly history of the town. The series
is dtill unfinished, but he plans to con-
tinue work on it in addition to his
work for another exhibition next year
in Melbourne. He also teaches art at
Newington College.
Delprat’s friendship with the Lindsay
family began with his maternal grand-
father, Howard Ashton, who studied
with Lindsay. “Then, when I was 18 or
19, Norman’s daughter Jane Glad, who
had taken some of my schoolboy paint-
ings for her gallery, said I should meet
Norman. Yes, I suppose he’s influenced
my work. I think it’s crazy not to admit
you’re influenced by someone. But I was
doing nude drawings at school. The
masters used to call them Amazons.”
He has never wanted to painlt abstracts
and says he isn’t suffering financially
through his determined disregard of
fashionable trends. This is his second
show and “people are buying, so who
cares about the critics.”

She walks towards you. Lissome and lovely,
from the top of her shining hair to her tiny
ankles. Your eyes travel down in a similar
movement to adding a column of figures.
And you’ve just executed “the book-keeper’s

WHEN THE
GURINDJI
OPTED OUT
By C. D. ROWLEY
The Unlucky Australians. Frank Hardy.
Nelson. $4.95.
“THIS BOOK,” Hardy says, “has all
the defects of a story written as it
happened.” A work of this length on a
subject so complicated, written in haste,
must lack a good deal of what might
have been gained artistically. I think it
is more serious that a passionate
partisanship, not grounded in detailed
knowledge of the background of
administrative policy, has led the author
much too freely to allocate blame to
individuals, where a deeper analysis is
required. Officials, for instance, have
sometimes faced a genuine dilemma—to
make the best of working with bad
policy, and to work for change from
within or to leave Aboriginal affairs to
others less perceptive. I think this com-
Hardy with (on his right) Vincent Lingiari and other Gurindji elders at Wattic Creek
plexity has been missed. There is a
whole reverse side, as it were, of Aus-
tralian history which is only now being
written. Yet the present is a critical
time in Aboriginal affairs, and not only
for Aborigines: and it is to Hardy’s
credit that he chose to get the story
out as soon as possible, at the cost of
what could possibly have been a much
more impressive literary achievement.
The central theme is that of the
walking off from Wave Hill by the
Gurindji. Hardy’s story accords with
other evidence I have seen as to how
and why this happened. It also fills in
many gaps. That a writer should have
played a leading role has resulted in an
important historical document. To
appreciate its importance, it is necessary
to understand that Northern and Cen-
tral Australia have retained, outside the
towns, many of the early colonial
features. Wages for “natives” have been
different, and in some areas, until re-
cently, there have been none at all, so
that the incentive to work has often
involved violence. Systems of wage pay-
ment have involved “truck,” with the
management making its own calcula-
tions of what had been issued from the
station store. Government has dele-
gated its functions to Christian missions
and even to employers. It is true, for
instance, as Hardy says, that pastoral
employers have been trusted to pay out
Social Service benefits to their employees
in circumstances where this could not
be supervised. There is the problem of
paying Social Service benefits which are
higher than the working wage. Especi-
ally relevant to the situation described
in this book has been the political
power of the big company to bypass
the local administration and go straight
to the sovereign government, as was so
common under colonial administration
everywhere.
Hardy’s theme is a small section of a
much bigger canvas. The Gurindji’s
dependency on the whims of employers
and the policy of private companies has
extended throughout the North and
Centre; and even Northern Territory
conditions as a whole form only part
of this story. Some of its ramifications
may be suggested by a glance at the
current legislation applying to Queens-
land Aboriginal settlements: or by re-
flecting that until decisions were made
after the NAWU case no legal mini-
mum wage at all applied in the sparsely
settled areas of Western Australia.
Finally, this “colonial” situation is, in a
sense, an earlier stage of a process of
interaction which so destroyed the
autonomy of Aboriginal society, without
offering alternatives, that it produced
the social remnants to be seen on the
inside of river bends in New South
Wales or on the camping reserves in
the south-west of Western Australia.
Hardy’s attempt to project this from a
single set of incidents is, therefore, justi-
fiable. On the other hand, he does not
know enough of the history to avoid
the occasional serious exaggeration.
There have, for instance, always been
good managements as well as bad ones,
though “good” here applies within the
context of the economics and the
paternalism of the total situation.
Hardy’s basic argument is that the
situation poses basic moral issues which
Australians will avoid at their peril,
and that the way in which these are
settled will have a profound effect on
the future of all of us. I think he is
right here. We can only accord justice
to the Aboriginal now on the basis of
a genuine reconciliation. Reconciliation
requires adjustment of our basic
assumptions in day-to-day speech and
conduct. This will be almost as difficult
for white Australians as for white
Americans. I think Hardy is right again
in arguing that if we can’t do this we
cannot make the basic moral adjust-
ments required in foreign affairs and
immigration. Yet the development of
this kind of argument requires basic
study of the total situation which, to
be fair, Hardy has had no time to make.
The result is an occasional recklessness
about historical facts: the basing of a
whole argument on an assertion where
there is quite sound enough historical
evidence for the finding.
I think things were, and are often, as
bad as he says, but that there is a
whole range of situations, and that the
causes have been far more complicated
than he admits. In the Northern Terri-
tory, for instance, the Welfare Branch
has been caught in a most awkward
political situation. At the best it can
be no more than an instrument of
Commonwealth policy. Devoted and
conscientious attention to the execution
of bad policy may be more destructive
in some of its effects than absolute
neglect. In any case, we have to remem-
ber that policy in the past few decades
has brought about an increasing
Aboriginal population: that those of
full descent are increasing much more
rapidly than the whites, and those of
part-Aboriginal descent at a rate com-
parable with that of the population of
Singapore. Such facts do not affect the
rights and wrongs of the Gurindji case,
but they do indicate that there are other
sides to the story which are not con-
ceded here.
Perhaps the main achievement of this
book is that it has posed the situation
as a political one. In the past, govern-
ments have generally refused to accept
the transition from welfare administra-
tion and institutions to politics in the
wider sense: to accept the Aboriginal as
a political person with a right to
advance his own interests. Rather has
he been treated as a child, soldier, or

A lot of husbands
get talked into a heart attack.
A woman with a sharp tongue can cut her
husband dead. Stone dead. In the July issue
of Reader’s Digest, an eminent heart special-

Stop women. They make the Digest what it
is today the second biggest magazine

Digest women readers are in homes of higher
income, do more entertaining and have more
money to spend than the women readers of
any other magazine. Shop around and com-
pare. You’ll find that Digest female reader-

inmate of an asylum of some kind—at
the best.
The central event described by Hardy
is, I think, one of the two most signifi-
cant turning points in Aboriginal affairs
since World War 11. The first occurred
in 1946 when an Aboriginal group
marched shoulder to shoulder into Port
Hedland and took Don McLeod from
the local jail. The recent action of the
Gurindji, in staking a claim on grounds
of natural justice and prior occupation
to the sacred tribal lands on Wave Hill,
was, I think, the second. In each case
what had been conceptualised by white
protagonists, both for and against, as a
strike turned out to be something more
—an attempt to opt out of the whole
wretched business of working for whites,
to establish elsewhere on their own
economic base the autonomy of the
Aboriginal group and the dignity of the
person. It was surely no accident that
in both cases a move was made to set
up a company with assets of its own as
a kind of umbrella under which new
forms of leadership might be developed.
Here is something rare in the history
of Aboriginal affairs: the inside story,
told almost in the heat of battle, of
events which led to the petition to the
Governor-General for return of the
heartland of the tribal country. There
is the act of Aboriginal defiance in
staking claim to it: and the final deter-
mination to make a last stand there.
In the words of Vincent Lingiari:
“Don’t matter ’bout that Canberra mob.
Wattie Creek bin Gurindji country. We
go there.” Here was a claim based on
a right commonly recognised in cus-
tomary law, and raising the moral
question of how far law, imposed during
the past century or so of occupation
(which might go back 20,000 years),
could obliterate it. The Gurindji
assumption is that there exist both a
natural justice and minimal rights based
on prior occupation. There are glimpses
of Aboriginal respect for life in the
curious gentleness of Gurindji self-
assertion. After being harangued on the
necessity to withdraw men from the
Wave Hill pumps to make the strike
effective, old Vincent Lingiari replies:
“We not bin let them cattle die of
thirst. Them big . . . bosses not hear
them cattle die, but I bin hear them
cattle die.”
Hardy’s dialogue is sometimes uncon-
vincing, and, perhaps because of the
haste, the characters are not really
brought to life. But at his best there
are patches of very fine narrative. After
much debate a couple of dozen men
and women decide to make this last
stand. In the early “piccaninny dawn”
it seemed that they had changed their
minds, as there was no stirring in the
camp. But then “the women lit fires
and began cooking. Then the men
sorted the tools, wire, and rations into
heaps. Half an hour later more than
twenty men and six lubras set off (for
Wattie Creek) in single file. Bandy
walked in front carrying a heavy roll
of wire-netting on his head. Each car-
ried something—a tin of flour, a roll of
wire, a crowbar, an axe, a brace-and-
bit. They strode purposefully into the
rising sun.” This action by a few people
could yet prove to have brought the
whole matter right into the arena of
national, perhaps international, politics.
The remnants of a colonial executive in
the North may resist, as in the arrest
of Dexter Daniels for vagrancy while
he had money in his pocket. But we
have to remember that in the Territory
full civil rights have been held by
Aborigines for less than a decade.
The rejection of the Gurindji petition
does not solve the moral question. Not
all the sophistries can cover up what
we have inherited from history. If the
Gurindji do not get something of their
claim, the question goes unanswered.
But if they do, similar questions arise
all over Australia. Yet these do not have
to be answered only in the realm of
land rights, which are often quite
irrelevant to the current situation. It is
clear that the basic demand is for social,
economic, and political equality. Here,
as in many other areas of government,
the time has come for governments to
lead rather than react.
Hardy’s own position is interesting,
because his Communism becomes less
orthodox as the story progresses. The
Aboriginal Rights Council was not
reacting in accordance with Marxist
theory or along the line of Communist
orthodoxy: and neither was Hardy. One
feels that, confronted with the need for
moral decisions leading to action, he
has emerged as a rather wobbly Com-
munist. Obvious here is a complete
honesty in the man which sometimes
leads to errors of judgment by the
amateur historian.
I don’t think there is any need for
me to recommend this book to readers,
for there will inevitably be a fuss about
it. I think, too, that a lot of the fuss
could have been avoided; particularly
that it would have been a better book
with less attribution of responsibility to
individual persons. And Hardy knows
full well that we are all responsible. I
do not think that this is the major work
required on the Aboriginal question, but
Hardy may yet write it. What to me is
unconvincing dialogue is here offset by
quite fascinating tape-recorded state-
ments made by leaders of the Gurindji
and others. If the tapes have been kept
we have some interesting historical
evidence. There are also a number of
photographs which are of historic
importance.
To my mind there is too much Billy
Borker and too obvious an attempt to
appeal by use of irrelevant bar-room
jests. But this is a matter of taste. It
may have its point in that Hardy in
effect is letting us see the kind of person
who is making judgments. The judg-
ments may be questioned on occasions,
but the intention is fundamentally
honest: and perhaps such an exposure
was essential.
Possibly he falls into the trap of
paternalism himself when he asks,
“Should they go forward to assimilation
or backward to the Dreaming?” The
alternatives are not exclusive. And the
only answer is that this is not our busi-
ness or that of the government: equality
is the business of all. Perhaps the most
difficult beginning is to ask the right
questions. I think when we learn to do
this the answer will be “Aboriginal
decision-making and assistance on
request.”
THE "FILL" IS THE POEM
By ALEXANDER CRAIG
Concrete Poetry. An International
Anthology. Edited by Stephen Bann.
London Magazine Editions. $5.45.
I SUPPOSE it’s the duty of an Aus-
tralian critic dealing with this book
to try to give a clear idea, as soon as
he can, of Concrete poetry. This
McLuhan-age verse doesn’t resemble
any poetry that most readers are likely
to have seen. There are some (not
many) Concrete poets in this country,
but they don’t get published. This is
partly because editors of literary and
poetry magazines believe that what
they’re doing simply isn’t poetry
and partly because the design and
typography of many Concrete poems,
their choice of particular typefaces, and,
sometimes, their use of different-colored
inks could bump up printing costs con-
siderably. I know that a group of young
Concrete poets in one of our capital
cities recently resorted to broadsheet
publication, a few copies of which were
available in at least one sympathetic
small bookshop. Actually, the interna-
tional Concrete poetry movement’s now
about 16 years old. If it became more
widely known here, it could have the
same sort of public impact as the kine-
tic art in the peregrinating Powell Be-
quest exhibition which the “Concrete
Poetry” anthology in some respeots re-
sembles. The originators and the
pioneers are included, as, are such later
people as lan Hamilton Finlay, one of
the inventors of the “standing poem,”
the poems of which are also colored-
glass panels, wood, and sheet-metal.
The Concrete poets generally claim
to have abandoned anything resembling
the discursive speech which has been
the basis for all literature (I don’t
mean the distended “discursive mode”
which has so hurt and weakened Aus-
tralian poetry): the typical Concrete
poem is offered as, in itself, in toto
signalling or expressing a single thought.
Many Concrete poets want to compress
their content into the simplest, most
economical form possible, sometimes
with a positively truncated brevity. Fin-
lay uses a Concrete poem for the title of
a magazine that he edits: “Poor. Old.
Tired. Horse.” One word could suffice:
an American critic claimed the mis-
print “speilling” (suggesting both the
intended word “spelling” and “spiel-
ing”) as a Concrete poem. The desire
for ultimate compression apparently de-
rives from communication and in-
formation theory, from semantics and

The picture above represents the present sex
education system for the young in this coun-
try. Word of mouth where there should be
words of wisdom. And, more likely than not,
small boys (and girls) don’t always get their
facts straight. The pressing need to establish
an authoritative sex education system in
schools is discussed by an eminent social
worker in the July issue of Reader’s Digest.
It is articles like “Sex Education: Blunt
Answers to Tough Questions” that stop
people. Stop families. They make the Digest
what it is today—the leading family maga-
zine.* What’s more, families who read Digest
occupy higher positions, earn higher incomes,
drive more expensive cars and do more
entertaining than those families who read any
other magazine. Shop around and compare.
You’ll find that Digest readership is climbing
at a much higher rate than the others. If
you’re selling to families, it will pay you to
talk to a Digest man soon.
If you want your sales to grow, doesn’t it make
sense to use the growing advertising medium?

modern linguistics (there’s also a speci-
fically “Phonic” poetry). “Traditional”
poetry, said one Concrete poet, carries
too many images. Several Concrete
poets take that idea to- its logical ex-
treme, presenting separate printed
letters or words themselves as material.
But the development of the movement
has been quite diversified. Emmett
Williams’ attractive “do you remem-
ber?”, for example, is based on a simple
mathematical permutation and repeti-
tion of only the words iji its first
six lines: there are six words in each
line, 60 lines in all. Some Concrete
poets believe in “structure-content,” an
appeal to a purely visual “coincidence
and simultaneity of verbal and non-
verbal communications,” a poem as “an
object in and by itself”; others, it
seems to me, are as concerned as any
“traditional” poet with interpreting the
external world and with “more or less
subjective feelings.”
The difference is that the Concrete
poets, hoping to discard all discur-
siveness, rely heavily on the increas-
ing simplicity of language which, Colin
Cherry says, has balanced the increas-
ing complexity of technical applica-
tion. Their economy is at times
though by no means always—balanced
also by a thinness, a slightness, even
a banality of content, not helped by
an occasional pretentiousness of presen-
tation (occurring sometimes, too, in
Bann’s Introduction). Robert Lax
doesn’t give any extra dimension to
the “traditional,” stock poetic phrases
“the white bird,” “the dark hill,” and
“the dark sea” by repeating, reversing,
alternating, and arranging them be-
tween blank-space columns. At other
times, the Concrete poet can become
so preoccupied with the means of his
art as to confuse these with the ends.
It’s the typographical innovations of
the best Concrete poems which will
strike the reader most, and I think it’s
also these that offer the most to liter-
ature and to poetry as we now know
them. Bann isn’t being quite honest in
claiming that Concrete poets don’t, like
Appollinaire and Pierre Albert-Birot,
try directly to suggest a natural appear-
ance or a scene by print, though he
occasionally shows signs of wanting to
have his cake and eat it, too. Matthias
Goeritz’s “Die goldene Botschaft” on
successive pages simply changes the
density of the Spanish word oro (gold)
repeated in its square to “suggest
stages in the progressive accumulation
. . . from thin leaf to massive ingot”:
this is imitative realism and not art.
So is Finlay’s 69-word “net” poem
which imitates visually the net’s suc-
cessive casts, repeating “net” 63 times,
“near” five times,.and ending with one
“neat.” Bann nowhere mentions e. e.
cummings, .but anyone familiar with
that poet’s work will occasionally be
reminded quite forcibly of some of his
more meaningful typographical devices,
and one of the founders of the move-
ment, Augusto de Campos, in fact,
once translated cummings’ poems into
Portuguese.
De Campos is one of the three or
four most creative and original artists
in the whole movement: I would in-
stance the beautiful texture of his Car-
acol (“Snail”) poem on page 106,
which is achieved by a delicate and
functional patterning of heavy and light
versions of the same typeface, filling
up a rectangle. Eugen Gomringer’s
“snow” poem lyrically, almost hypnot-
ically, by a cumulative and progressive
elimination, makes the white snow a
thing in itself an absolute. Decio
• Pignatori’s “book-poem” or pamphlet
“LIFE” is starkly interesting typo-
graphically, telescoping two of its
block capitals on its fifth page into a
grim Roman equivalent of a Chinese
ideogram and with the complete word
almost sliding off its sixth and final
page: it’s marred 'by an unintentional
association with the magazine of that
name. Pierre Garnier’s “list” poems
hint at possible new forms and now
and then succeed on their own terms.
Finlay’s punning “au pair girl” (O pear
girl), cut pretty closely to the shape
of a pear, is a charming if ambiguous
compliment, but its content is trifling,
like that of almost all his Concrete-
period poems. Dom Silvester Houe-
dard’s “typestract” invention, “cloud,”
consisting solely of that word, is pleas-
ing to the eye, though it’s somewhere
midway between poetry and painting;
his “thalamus/sol” poem in two colors
(made up of just the title words)
comes as close to kinetic sculpture as
print probably ever can.
Ernst Jandl’s “a whole washbowl”
shows real humor. Edwin Morgan’s
“French Persian Cats having a Ball”
is visually and punningly very funny:
I’d like to nominate him, if I may,
as the Edward Lear or the Lewis Car-
roll of the international Concrete move-
ment. His “Computer’s first Christmas
card” thumbs its nose very effectively
at machine-made art generally.
The Concrete poetry movement be-
gan during the early 19505, its origina-
tors —quite independently of one an-
other—being Gomringer in Switzerland
and the Brazilian joint enterprise of
Pignatori and the two de Campos broth-
ers, Haraldo and Augusto. The
Brazilian experimenters were relatively
more lyrical than the German followers
of Gomringer or the Austrian Wiener
Gruppe: also, theirs were by far the
most exciting typographical and “semio-
tic” innovations still imitated at
times by Finlay and the editor of this
anthology. The book itself is beautifully
designed and printed by the Shenval
Press, pleasant to handle, but its paper
could have been thicker. On some inner
pages, a typographical design shows
through to spoil a piece where a poet’s
depending for a good deal of his effect
on the use of blank space. Also, the
jacket, which resembles thin, trans-
parent, greaseproof lunchpaper, isn’t
very durable, yet the print on it com-
pletes that of the front and back boards,
and contains useful information.

HOW DOES AN
ORIENTAL CARPET
INCREASE IN VALUE
WITH HARD USE?
Do you know that Oriental rugs
are the most durable carpets ever
produced? This is because there are
between 10,000 and one million
hand-tied knots in many rugs securing
every strand of wool in the pile to
the foundation threads. The amount
of wool per square inch of carpet
is enormous. Feel the weight of even
a small Oriental carpet.
This is only one aspect of
Oriental rugs. Because they are
natural carpets woven of handspun
local wool and still produced under
the original conditions by the peasants
and nomads of Western Asia, their
marks of use actually add character.
The vegetable dyes mellow and
colours grow more beautiful with
age.

WHEN IS A
GULYAS NOT
A GOULASH?
THE MYTH that all Hungarians live
on a diet of goulash makes about as
much sense as assuming that all Chinese
exist on a diet of chop suey. In fact,
Hungarian cuisine, as it is known today,
has been greatly influenced by all that
is best in European cuisine. After the
extinction of the first Hungarian
dynasty a polyglot line of ruling fami-
lies succeeded each other, each monarch
in turn marrying a wife from a different
country outside Hungary. And the
dishes served at the royal tables gradu-
ally filtered down to lesser mortals.
Paprika is recognised far and wide
as the Hungarian national spice. But in
actual fact it was unknown in Hungary
until a century ago. Paprika was prob-
ably first brought to Europe after the
beginning of the 16th century from the
East and West simultaneously. Colum-
bus introduced paprika into Spain from
America, and about the same time the
Turks overran Hungary. When the
Turks had settled down they began to
plant the oriental paprika for use in
their own kitchens.
Nowadays, of course, paprika is
decidedly the typical condiment of
Hungarian national cookery. Its sweet,
piquant flavor is by no means any
hotter than black or white pepper used
in other cooking, and its color adds a
great deal to the many traditional
dishes of Hungary. Paprika contains a
certain amount of sugar, and for this
reason care must foe taken not to over-
cook the paprika in hot lard or the
sugar content will caramelise and both
color and flavor will be spoilt.
By non-Plungarians almost all
dishes cooked with paprika are
labelled with the same name: goulash.
And in actual fact this is all wrong.
Gulyas, strictly speaking, is a soup.
Porkolt is the stew we foreigners tend
to call goulash. Gulyas is a dish with
plenty of gravy made with onions
and paprika. Potatoes cut into cubes
are cooked and served with it, and
often it is served with Csipetke.
Porkolt literally means “scorched”
or “singed,” and finely chopped onions
play a greater part in its preparation.
Tokany is somewhat similar, but the
meat is cut smaller and less paprika
and onions are needed. It also contains
mushrooms, sour cream, green peas,
carrots, or parsnips.
Paprikas, in restaurant terminology,
means dishes flavored with paprika and
the gravy is made with sour cream.
It is a way of cooking fish and fowl.
Here, then, are the recipes for the
best of traditional Hungarian dishes
ideal for eating when the cold winter
winds begin to blow.
Gulyas for four or six (depending on
your appetites) requires 21b. loin beef,
12oz. onions and potatoes, 2 cloves of
garlic, 1 teaspoon caraway seeds, l|oz.
paprika, a green capsicum, and a couple
of large tomatoes.
Cut the beef into cubes and
wash well. Chop onions finely and fry
a delicate brown in lard. Sprinkle salt
on the meat and add to the pan. Cover
and cook for 30 minutes (when the
water evaporates, add water or stock).
Cut potatoes into cubes the same size
as the meat. When meat is tender, add
caraway seeds, paprika, sliced capsicum,
and sliced tomatoes. Add potatoes last
of all. Cover with sufficient water and
allow to simmer until potatoes are done.
Serve with Csipetke if you want a
truly traditional dish.
Csipetke is prepared by making a stiff
paste of |lb. flour, 3 eggs, and some
water and salt. Allow to stand for a
little while and then roll out thinly.
Tear into pieces the size of a penny and
scatter over a board to prevent sticking.
Drop them individually into boiling
salt water. When they rise to the surface,
rinse in cold water, drain, and fry
quickly in a little hot lard. Scatter with
a little crumbled cottage cheese and
sour cream to serve, and a few cubes of
bacon crumbled when fried crisply in
its own fat.
Porkolt can be made with veal, pork,
mutton, or fowl. For six people you
will need 31b. of the meat of your choice.
Enough lard to fry the meat, 6 onions,
salt, paprika, tomato puree, and 2-3
green capsicums.
Fry the onions until golden, add a
tablespoon of paprika, and then the
meat cut into cubes. Salt to taste and
stew very slowly with very little liquid.
Add more to prevent sticking as you
go along. When the meat is half
cooked add a small tin of tomato puree
and the sliced capsicums, and cook
until tender. Serve with gnocchi, rice,
or potatoes, and pass around a salad
and some pickled cucumbers.
Seven Chieftain Tok any requires lib.
veal, lib. pork, 11b. beef, 4oz. smoked
bacon, 4oz. lard, |lb. onions, loz. flour,
salt, paprika, jdb. green capsicums, 4oz.
tomatoes, and a carton of sour cream.
Brown onions in lard, braise the steak,
pork, and veal adding them in that
order to make allowances for their dif-
ferent cooking times. Add water in
small amounts when all meat has been
fried. When the meat is almost tender,
season with paprika and add other in-
gredients. When the stew is ready
(approximately 2 hours), thicken with
flour and sour cream. Garnish with addi-
tional rings of green capsicums and
serve with gnocchi.
This dish is named after the seven
chieftains who first brought the Ancient
Magyars to their present country
and will feed just about as many, and
maybe a few more besides.

MPs' salaries compared
It was incorrect to state (8., June 22):
“At present they (MPs) have a salary
of $7OOO. In Canberra this puts them
on a par with Class 8 officers in the
Third Division of the Public Service,
about a dozen levels down from the
top. It is a salary level which an
average university graduate joining the
Government service can expect to get
by the age of 30.”
The facts are that the majority of
university graduates cannot expect to
receive, and do not receive, $7OOO p.a.
by the age of 30. A Class 8 officer’s
maximum salary is $6690 p.a. The
career expectancy of the majority of
professional officers does not extend to
beyond Class 3 of their professional
classification and many retire without
having attained a salary of $6OOO p.a.
The article also included the state-
ment: “Parliamentarians were once paid
at the same level as Arbitration Com-
missioners and Second Division officers
in the Commonwealth service. Now they
are $5OOO behind.” Table 47 of the

China's borders
The attitude of Mr. Samuel (8., June
29) on the question of China’s borders
seems somewhat unusual. The Com-
munist Chinese have simply to pub-
lish a map of former territories lost
largely as a result of the expansionist
tendencies of others and they are con-
demned outright—despite the fact that
they (a) have made no part or current
claim to these territories, (b) disavow
the map in question as a basis for a
claim to these territories, and (c)
would, in many cases, appear to have
ruled out the basis for any future claim
by negotiating or proposing border
agreements with those into whose terri-
tory they are supposed to wish to
expand.

CAF and CUF at Monash
The article “When CAF and CUF-ed
at Monash” (8., June 29) refers to
CAF (Campaign for Academic Free-
do'm) as a body formed by DLP repre-
sentatives on CUF (Campaign for Uni-
versity Freedom) who later broke away.
This is not exactly the way it hap-
pened. In fact, CAF membership is
largely made up of people who pre-
ferred to support a student organisation
bound to act on principles of non-
violent reform, and were worried about
frequent calls for demonstrations from
members of CUF. The article also
mentions a “CAF non-violence pro-
posal” which was blocked by sections
of CUF. This proposal, although sup-
ported in principle by CAF, was to my
knowledge moved by a member of the
DLP Club, who was also (and still is)
a member of CUF.
P. J. Perazzo
Murrumbeena, Vic.
As an apathetic, manipulated degree
hunter of Monash University, I wish to
challenge the accuracy of the opening
remarks in an article concerning Mon-
ash (B., June 29).
Your opening paragraph states: the
“radicals took control” of the SRC and
“got the votes to dissolve it.” The
radicals aimed at implementing a sys-
tem “based on frequent mass meetings
and ad hoc committees of activists.”
Let me state from the outset that
these were not radicals, and they did
not want a government based on mass
meetings and ad hoc committees of
activists. Their system aimed at separ-
ating the representative and adminis-
trative functions of student government.
The old SRC seldom had time to repre-
sent the students and lacked contact
with the student body. It seldom had
time to represent as it functioned as an
administrative bureaucracy, and was
continually bogged down in petty
administrative detail. The new system
separates the administration and repre-
sentation roles, and ai'ms at creating
two bodies, one for each function.
The role of the general meetings,
which can be called by students or by
the government, is threefold. They
scrutinise, question, and criticise the
actions of their representation. They
are convened to elect new representa-
tives when the old exhibit incompet-
ence. Thirdly, they are used to facilitate
judgment by the representatives of what
the attitude of the student body is to
contentious issues.
Ever since Monash started, the SRC
has shown itself to be ineffective and
inefficient. This is the third ti'me these
reform proposals have been put for-
ward. They have now been accepted by
every past-president of the SRC and
have been overwhelmingly accepted by
the student body. They will be in-
stituted as soon as possible.
