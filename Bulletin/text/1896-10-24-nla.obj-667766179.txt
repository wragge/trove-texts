THE RED PAGE.
“ Something about myself ? Oh, clear ! Won’t
it look very conceited ? Well, if it does don’
blameone. Are you sure The Bulletin wants it
Do you know, I’d much rather not.
“I’m 48. But you don’t want to tell the
people my age, do you ? I was married when ]
was 18—and what I’ve gone through since then
It would fill a book. You know my husband’
name was Peter Larsen, but Henry’s name i
really Lawson—he was registered Lawson—tha
was the way people always spoke of my husband
“He is dead years now. Of the children, !
think Bert takes after him more : Henry is like
me : Gertie is more like my mother. You have
heard hew clever Bert is at music? and every
body knows Henry. Gertie is with me now
working on The Dawn. Henry and Bert are ii
Westralia.
“My father is alive still—such a fine old man
—he must be about 75 now : mother died only
the other day. Father’s father and mother were
such good old people—that’s my grandfather anc
mother—Henry’s great-grand-ioarents. The ole
lady—she had worked hard all her life, poor soul
—she could reap her three-quarters of an acre ol
wheat in a day—and when she felt herself going tc
die she got out of bed and washed herself, dressed
in clean clothes, lay down again, and folded her
hands on her breast—‘so as not to give trouble,
she said.
. “Father is a born poet; they tell me I take
after him. You can see the likeness in this por-
trait : Henry is the same. He is a good old
Kentish yeoman, is father; a big, strong, hand-
some man. You think I’m handsome ? Do you
really ? I suppose I am tidier and stronger than
most women : I’d need to be, for what I’ve gone
through.
“ And why shouldn’t a woman be tall and
strong ? I feel sorry for some of the women that
come to see me sometimes : they look so weak and
helpless—as if they expected me to pick ’em up
and pull ’em to pieces and put ’em together again.
I try to speak softly to them, but sometimes I
can’t help letting out, and then they go away and
say, ‘ Mrs. Lawson was so unkind to us ! ’
“ And whose fault is it but men’s? Women are
what men make them. Why, a woman can’t bear
a child without it being received into the hands of
a male doctor; it is baptised by a fat old male
parson; a girl goes through life obeying laws
made by men ; and if she breaks them, a male
magistrate sends her to a gaol where a male
warder handles her and looks in her cell at night
to see she’s all right. If she gets so far as to be
hanged, a male hangman puts the rope round her
neck; she is buried by a male gravedigger; and
she goes to a Heaven ruled over by a male God
or a hell managed by a male devil. Isn’t it a
wonder men didn’t make the devil a woman ?
“ Run down the men ! Don’t you go away with
that idea. Men are gods—and women are angels.
And do you know what you make them suffer?
I declare, it’s the most pitiful thing in the world.
When I come sometimes to a meeting of these
poor working women - little, dowdy, shabby
t lings all worn down with care and babies
doing their best to bring up a family on the
pittance they get from their husbands—and ke
those husbands at home and away from t
public-honse—when I see their poor lined fac
i reel inclined to cry. They suffer so much.
And listen to their talk ! so quiet and sensibi
It you want real practical wisdom, go to an o
washerwoman patching clothes on the Rocks wi
a buckeye and you’!! hear more true philosopt
than a I arliament of men will talk in a twelv
month.
“No, I don’t run down men, but I run dow
their vanity—expeoially when they’re talking an
writing about women. A man editing a ladie
paper ! or talking about a woman’s question
Parliament ! 1 don t know whether to laugh i
cry : they know so little about us. We see i
Oh, why don’t the women laugh right out—no
quietly to themselves; laugh all together ; get r
on the housetops and laugh, and startle you out o
your self-satisfaction.
Men are so sell-satisfied. WLy, would yo
r was talking a while ago to a membe;
of Parliament and sympathising with him abou
his wife—-he s separated from her, poor thing 1 !
and saying how hard people were on a woma
that s alone, and he looked up at me so innocentk
and said, * I’m not in the market, Mrs. Lawson
The fool thought I wanted to marry him ! and t
this day I believe he thinks he had a narrow
escape. Boor men !
“ Dcd you ever think what it was to be
woman, and have to try to make a living by her
self, with so many men’s hands against her. It’
all right if she puts herself under the thumb of s
man-she’s respectable then ; but woe betide he
if she str.kes out for herself and tries to compet
with men on what they call 1 their own ground.
Who made it their own ground?
“ Why, when I started out ten years ago to
make a woman’s paper—The Dawn—this is the las
number of it the compositors boycotted me, anc
they even tried to boycott us at the Post Office—
wouldn’t let it go through the post as a news
paper. I knew nothing about printing, but I fel
1 could write—or, anyhow', I felt I could feel—
so I scraped a few pounds together and got
machine and some type, and I and the girls began
to print without knowing any more about it than
Adam.
“ How did we learn to set type and lock up
forme? Goodness knows ! Just worked at it til
we puzzled it out ! And how the men used to
come and patronise us, and try to get something
out of us ! I remember one day a man from the
Christian World came round to borrow a block
—a picture. I wouldn’t lend it to him; I saic
we had paid a pound for it, and I couldn’t afforc
to go and buy blocks for other papers. Then he
stood by the stone and sneered at the girls lock-
ing up the formes. We were just going to press,
and you know locking-up isn’t always an easy
matter —particularly for new-chums like we were.
“Well, he stood there and said nasty things,
and poor Miss Greig—she’s my forewoman—and
the girls, they got as white as chalk : the tears
were in their eyes. I asked him three times to go,
and he wouldn’t, so I took up a watering-pot full
of water that we had for sweeping the floor, and I
let him have it.
“ It went up with a s-swish, and you should
just have seen him ! He was so nicely dressed—
all white flannel and straw - hat, and spring
flowers in his button-hole; and it wet him through
—knocked his hat off and filled his coat-pocket
full of water. He was brave, I’ll say that; he
wouldn’t go; he just wiped himself and stood
there getting nastier and nastier, and I lost
patience. ‘Look here,’ I said, ‘do you know
what we do in the bush to tramps that come
bothering us ? We give ’em clean water first, and
then, if they won’t go, we give ’em something like
this.’ And I took up the lye-bucket, that we
used for cleaning type : it was thick, with an inch
of black scum on it like jelly, that wobbled when
you shook it. I held it under his nose, and said :
‘Do you see this ? ’ And he went in a hurry.
“ Did Henry help me ? He did that. His father
thought a lot of Henry ; he used to call him a tiger
for work. Poor boy ! when we were starting
Dawn he used to turn the machine for us; he
would just get some verse in his head and go on
turning mechanically, forgetting all about us. He
didn’t like to be interrupted when he was think-
ing, so often when the issue was all printed off
we would go upstairs to supper and leave him
there turning away at the empty machine, with
his eyes shining.
“ Are you married ? I am glad : a bachelor is
only half a man. But so many of you think that
a wife is bought by a wedding-dress and a ring.
No ! a womaa is bound to a man only by her love
for him, her respect for him, to the extent of her
trust and faith in him. O, if men would permit
us to trust and honor them ! We do so wish to.”
A Poet’s Mother—Louisa Lawson.
[Many gifted men have bad remarkable mothers,'anc
Henry Lawson’s mother, Mrs. Peter Larsen (better
known as Louisa Lawson), is in mmy ways a remarkable
woman. Born at Guntawang, near Mudgee, JN’.S.VV.
she has suffered all her life from that craving
for knowledge and culture which one sees in so
many bush girls -often suppressed in deference to their
not-understandiug men-folk, som limes fighting hope-
lessly against the round of trivialities in which Custom
circumscribes a woman, rarely succeeding to reach an en-
lightened plane of thought or performance.—Louisa Law-
son’s moth“r burnt her books; her husband, a clever, capable
man, frowned down her impulse to imaginative work ;
friends and relatives looked askance at her “queer ways.”
The energy of a magnificent physical constitution enabled
her to struggle on. She read, and wrote, and occasion-
ally talked. When she came to Sydney a dozen years
ago, a poor little wooden cross maiked the grave of poet
Kendall in YVaverley cemetery. Maybe the sentiment was
a foolish one, for Kendall’s monument is in his work,
but Mrs. Lawson initiated a movement whiijh replaced
the shabby Itttle cross with a handsome monument.
Then she started "The Dawn, a journal for the household,
edited, printed, and published by women.” The paper
is living yet, and in its heyday spoke many brave and
true words. Then she organised the first Woman’s
Suffrage League established in Sydney. Then bhe
was chosen a member of Sydney School of Arts com-
mittee, and for several years her strong sense was a
force in its deliberations. Recently she has become a
Government contractor—and inventor. For 21 years
N. W. mail-bags have been fastened with a strap, sealed
by a device invented by Superintendent Davies. Mrs.
Lawson took a contract for supplying these straps, and it
struck her at once that the contrivance for fastening was
slow and cumbrous. So it was, undoubtedly ; the astonish-
ing thing is that in 21 years the consensus of male wisdom
among postal officials should not have bettered it. In
odd moments Mrs. Lawson thought out an improved
buckle, had a model made from her description, and took
it to the Post Office authorities, who instantly recognised
its ingenuity and adopted it. It saves two - thirds
O. the time formerly needed to fasten the bags,
and many hundreds of pounds annually in value of
string and wax. Mrs. Lawson’s portrait in another
J*art of this issue barely does her justice. The expression
is too hard. Despite all, Louisa Law’son is essentially a
womanly woman, of a characteristically feminine type.
Her nature is the groundwork of her son Henry’s ; but
•here is in him the additional element of restless male
intensity.—And now Mrs. Lawson may speak a little
space for herself.]
Items.
Douglas W. B. Sladen, who writes insipic
comments on literature for Lond. Queen, remarks
in reference to Louise Mack’s “ World is Round ’
that in a city where The Bulletin is a power,
art and literature have a good deal to struggle
against.” Not so much, anyway, as when Sladen
sloped around Australia and edited a collection
of Australian verses for a London publisher in
which his own tame rhymes take up nearly as
much space as the poetry of Kendall or
Brunton Stephens. The Bulletin has a lot of
faults to answer for, but it never sank quite so
f° w J l,B to maltreat a thrilling theme in the cruel
fashion of Sladen when he wrote of Mrs. Watson,
the heroine of Lizard Island
This woman was born of a nation of freemen,—
Their birthright to dare and to die on the wave;
Yet even to Britain's adventurous seamen
"Twere hardly disgrace if they seemed not as brave.
What wonder if Gilbert who sank in the “Squirrel.”
Or Davis, or Baffin, or Frobisher shrank
From facing the strange supernatural peril
Of crossing the sea in a worn water-tank?
No drain left to drink—yet she would not be fearful
But in painful and feeble handwriting had writ *
That her baby “ was better and more cheerful
And condensed milk appeared to agree with it.”
Not even the steamer when passing so near her,
Unheeding the signals she hoisted in vain,
Could sicken the hope from her heart or dis-cheer her ;
She noted it down, but she did not complain.
And this occurs in a volume called “Australian
Lyrics”! Will the Nocent Waterspout kindly
rise and break something?
“ Steele Qrey ” is collecting his Bulletin
and other verses with a view to publication.
P. : “ Earthly Paradise Morris had the
ill-luck not to be read. His vols. even look
archaic, as if dating from the Spenser era. His
poetry might be akin to his wall-papering, a gor*
geous product of the loom, and when you turned
to the four walls of the apartment they were all
the same. It was faultless, in the genre, yet un-
fortunate to be contemporary with Swinburne.
Homer may nod, but never Morris, unless he be
all one sweet dozy luscious slumber.”
One Who is There : “No doubt we have
in Paterson’s verses Art, with its rightful capital
A, if only by reason of the fact that he makes his
bushinan an interesting oove, fond of bright sun-
sets and humorous in speech. Anyone who can do
that is an artist. I have always found Bushy a
shy, dull man, a good worker, but altogether
lacking humor and sense of natural beauty; a
man fond of swagger and addicted to the use of
senseless adjectives in conversation, topped up
with “bloody.” And when he sings—well, it’s
time to crawl through the slip-rails and away.
Certainly, Clancy may have been a different fel-
low; but where is Clancy, anyway? The bush
has its charms, but only to those who understand
it; and it seems to me that the majority are too
anxious to reach the next waterhole, and too
busy sweeping off flies and sweat, to regard with
fitting ecstasy the beauties that townsfolk never
know. Wherefore Paterson’s tales of the bush
are as it might be rather than as it is. As imagin-
ative work, his verses are indeed brilliant.”
J. Le Gay Brereton : “Is the Red Page
invading- the realm of humor? It declares that
only the meat-eater can write poetry, and—with
some circumlocution—stigmatises the ‘ upholders
of the Cabbage theory of existence ’ as noodles. It
parodies a line in which Tennyson alludes to
Edward Fitzgerald’s abstinence from the adored
' beef-steak.’ (‘Who live on grass and grain and
clothes-line ’ is meant, I suppose, for a murdered
echo of ‘ Who live on milk and meal and grass.’)
On the same page are reprinted with approval
eighteen stanzas of the vegetarian poet’s ‘ Omar
Khayyam,’ and Saintsbury’s dictum that the poem
is ‘actually, though not original or English, one
of the greatest of English poems.’ Funny ! ”
[Pooh! Didn t. Deelared “ literature rests upon
a beefsteak basis, and no poetry ever came out of
a pump.” Whole article-tenor showed meat-
stimulus and alcohol-stimulus were held largely
convertible. Fitz. smoked; drank all his life—wine,
beer, porter, what-not. And, though consistent
Cabbage-man, he was not bigoted ; amongst the
more delightful of his pleasures, says his ’B7
biographer (Houghton, Mifflin’s ed.), he counted
yachting excursions “ accompanied only by a crew
of two men and such a friend as Cowell, with a
large pasty and a few bottles of wine to supply
their material wants.” Also, B. is unsubtle as
well as inaccurate. Wide difference between
declaring F.’s translation “one of the greatest of
Eng. poems, ’ and F. one of the greatest of Eng.
poets. Stuff is Omar’s ; F. the embroiderer ; he
created little. Knew 'this himself ; would never
put his name on title-page ; “used to say it
would imply an assumption of importance
which he considered that his ' transmogrification ’
of the Persian poet did not possess.” Grant Fitz.
the art : the energy is Omar’s. You bet Omar ate
meat. And a good half of his Rubaiyat glorifies
Wine; his philosophy is the essence of Materialism;
Fitz. defended him from the charge of Mysticism;
and now to have his credit collared for the Cab-
bage-men ! Pooh !]

L'ANCIEN REGIME; OR, THE GOOD
OLD RULE.
Who has a thing to bring
Fmr a gift to our lord the king,
Our king all kings above ?
A young girl brought him love;
And he dowered her with shame,
With a sort of infamous fame,
And then with lonely years
Of penance and bitter’tears :
Love is scarcely the thing
To bring as a gift for our king.
Who has a thing to bring
For a gift to our lord the king?
A statesman brought him planned
Justice for all the land ;
And he in recompense got
Fierce struggle with brigue and plot*
Then a fall from lofty place
Into exile and disgrace :
Justiee is never the thing
To bring as a gift for our king.
Who has a thing to bring
Fur a gift to our lord the king?
A Writer brought him truth ;
And first he imprisoned the youth J
And then he bestowed a free pyre
That the works might have plenty of Im,
And also to cure the pain
Of the headache called thought in the brain';
Truth is a very bad thing
To bring as a gift for our king.
Who has a thing to bring
For a gift to our lord the king?
The people brought their sure
Loyalty fervid and pure ;
And he gave them bountiful spoil
Of taxes and hunger and toil,
Ignorance, brutish plight,
And wholesale slaughter in fight:
Loyalty’s quite the worst thing
To bring as a gift for our king.
Who hg,s a thing to bring
For a gift to our lord the king?
A courtier brought to his feet
Servility graceful and sweet,
With an ever ready smile
And an ever supple guile ;
And he got in reward the place
Of the statesman in disgrace :
Se rvility’s always a thing-
To bring as a gift for our king.
Who has a thing to bring
For a gift to our lord the king?
A soldier brought him war,
La gloire, la victoire.
Ravage and carnage and groans,
For the pious Te I)cum tones ;
And he got in return for himself
Rank and honours and pelf :
War is a very nice thing
To bring as a gift for our king.
Who has a tiling to bring
For a gift to our lord the king?
A harlot brought him her flesh,
Her lusts, and the manifold mesh
Of her wiles intervolved with caprice ;
And he gave her his realm to fleece,
To corrupt, and ruin, and gave
Himself for her toy and her slave ;
Harlotry’s just the thing
To bring as a gift for our king.
Who has a thing to bring
For a gift to our lord the king?
Our king who fears to die ?
A priest brought him a lie,
The blackness of hell uprolled
In heaven’s shining gold;
And he got as guerdon for that
A see and a cardinal’s hat :
A lie is an excellent thing
To bring as a gift for our king.
Has any one yet a thing
For a gift to our lord the king?
The country gave him a tomb,
A magnificent sleeping-room ;
And for this it obtained some rest,
Clear riddance of many a pest,
And a hope which it much enjoyed
That the throne would continue void :
A tomb is the very best thing
For a gift to our lord the king.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHES I', BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing’ cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily'
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy' had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly'and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 EJizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow' discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&e., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin-diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case,. send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.

A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS

When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and 0,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: 1 ‘ There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round —
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer —for you to plead : There would have

SETTLED.
[N.S.W. Lands Minister Carruthers ventured a year ago
to undertake to settle 2000 new settlers on the soil, within
twelve months, but the results show that in the period
mentioned he has succeeded in implanting no less than
2516 families in new holdings as residential selectors.” —
S.M. Herald.
He settled them all!
How he boasts thro’ the press !
From the storm and the stress
Of a life in the towns—why, he set them all free !
And he sent them out West
Just to “give them a rest’, —•
Unemployed and dead-brokers —“ landowners to
be.”
And the dailies applaud
Till their readers are bored
With reports that come down from Macquarie-st.
Hall
How he settled them all.
He settled them all!
Two thousand—no less—
Their wise settler now bless
That a home “on the soil ” they’ve been granted
at last.
So they rake up some tin,
For to stay, would be sin,
In the cities that threatened their prospects to
blast.
And they sing as they go
For they guessed—doncherknow—
That Carruthers would save them from going to
wall,
So he settled them all.
He settled them all!
And by Jingo he did
With his theories glib,
So they leased, or selected, or “ homesteads ” they
got.
(But with homesteads to build
Ere their coppers they gild !)
All two thousand five hundred —each man with
his plot.
Now the problem was solved.
From his brain he evolved
How to “ fetch ” all the people—at his feet make
them fall,
For he settled them all.
“He settled us all! ”
Ere ten years have gone by
The survivors will cry
From the scrubs way out back where their over-
drafts grew.
“ By our fate be ye taught
How the squatters we’ve fought,
All the banks, dingoes, droughts and curst
wallabies, too !
Aye, they all lent a hand
When we once got the land.
They were there at the finish—they came at his
call,
Thus he settled us all! ”

THE DAWSON SIDE.
Bound homeward, from the western side —a dusty,
droughty land ;
I’m battling down the Warrego, through mulga
scrub and sand ;
Old Stumpy, tugging at the rein, jogs on with
quickened stride,
His thoughts, like mine, are miles away, upon the
Dawson side.
I watched last evening, when the sun went flaring
out of sight,
Till, glancing through the ironbarks, the moon
came shining bright,
Reminding me of must’nng time, and many a
thrilling ride
By moonlight, through the coolibahs, way down
the Dawson side.
And, in my dreams, I rode along beneath a cloudy
sky ;
I saw the flow’ring sandalwoods, the blue grass
waving high ;
I listened to the thunder roll along the Great
Divide,
And heard the rain come swishing down upon the
Dawson side.
O Stumpy, shove along, old man, they only starve
who stay;
Our track leads on through barren plains, dark
scrubs, and forests grey,
To long lagoons where, midst the reeds, the swan
and wild-duck glide,
To grassy flats where cattle feed along the Daw-
son side.

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
Law and Order.
There ought to be no necessity for the con-
stant appeals, which are still regularly made,
for recognition of the excellences of law and
order. The arguments are so plain that the
most ordinary capacity cannot fail to per-
ceive their force. Besides, they appeal, or
seem to appeal, to selfishness—a motive
which unfortunately had more power to the
square inch than abstract morality. It does
not need a man of unspotted past to appre-
ciate the value of law and order. A vener-
able burglar, retired from business, and end-
ing his days in decent ease on the fruits of
his manly energy, has the keenest apprecia-
tion of the serviceableness of the night-
watchman in his street. And, indeed, law
and order are generally desired for the ob-
servance and the restraint of the other
fellow. But the fad which continues to call
for the reiterated exhortations that people
shall obey law and observe order is that
almost everybody gives some tokens of a
conviction that there is a necessity for an ex-
ception in his own case, in view of his parti-
cular circumstances. This claim to exemp-
tion from the strict application of moral
obligations which all are disposed to acknow-
ledge, in the abstract, extends to class in-
terest. The boot-seller recognises that it is
wrong for the grocer to adulterate sugar and
peppfer, but as a brother tradesman he does
not perceive the iniquity of the practice so
keenly as does the professional man. The
grocer does not regard himself as a swindler
and law-breaker at all. He has smothered
his conscience with the sophistry that it is a
trick of the trade. He must do” it or be un-
dersold by other grocers and reduced to beg-
gary. But he recognises the rascality of the
boot-seller labelling a structure of brown-
paper and blocked leather-scraps as “sound
leather.” The high-grade barrister scorn-
fully regards both, with an equal eye as petty
and sordid rogues, and they both agree in
considering the high-grade barrister, who
pockets fees for law-suits in which he omits
to appear, as an embezzler of singular
effrontery. Tradesman and professional
man are of one mind as to the reprehen-
sible rascality of the artisan and laborer
who shirk their iull hours of hard slogging or
scamp their piecework, and the man of the
profession and the man of trade combine
to execrate the “pernicious folly” of work-
men who attempt to extort more than the
employers want to pay, by refusing to deal
on those terms and continuing to refuse
until they are starved into submission. Of
late years in many countries classes have
been so balanced that the professionals have
not been strong enough to deal with the
traders for their iniquities. And the traders
have not been strong enough to- deal with
the professionals. Further, there has not
been a despot powerful enough to lay his
hand upon either, let alone both. And the
laborers, who form the majority and have to
provide by their exertions the spoils for
which all scramble, have nowhere learned so
to organise and concentrate their latent
power as to bring the parasitical classes
under discipline.
* * * *
Innumerable small instances and indica-
tions, in fact, signify that a spirit of violence
and chicanery permeates all conditions and
ranks of so-called civilised mankind. While
each calls upon every other to practise
gentleness and honesty, and professes, and
perhaps feels, astonishment that the power-
ful should be pitiless and the weak subtle
and sly, no one appears to have sought a
reason for the general corruption of prin-
ciples and of practices. At no period of the
world’s history have the teachings of a lofty
morality been more widely or more persis-
tently inculcated by precepts. Examples of
domestic virtue—after the modern Western
patter—are exhibited on every throne. The
heir to a crown is no longer the probable
centre of a plot to assassinate the monarch.
Bravos find no harborage in the purlieus of
palaces. Desperadoes cannot hope that, like
Colonel Blood, they may secure, even by the
failure to accomplish a half-completed mon-
strous crime, not merely a pardon but a
pension. Feminine depravity offers no pros-
pect of sovereign favor and patents of highest
nobility. The harlot can have but tempered
hopes of becoming, without the formality of
a patrician marriage, the ancestress of a long-
line of haughty peers. In all these respects
the influence of example has tended towards
the improvement of the servile and imita-
tive. It may be distinctly perceived that
these improvements in example have been
productive of corresponding improvements
in general manners. Domestic poisonings,
once common, have become rare, almost to
the point of disappearance. The common
bully or bravo is an extinct species.
Feminine adherence to the conventions of
regular connections has become much stricter
than in past generations. And the excep-
tions help to sustain the hypothesis that the
general conduct of the multitude, at any .
stated period, is closely related to the sort of
models prominently before people’s eyes.
Generations seem to write their history in a
style distinctly affected by the sort of head-
lines put before them by authority.
* * * *
If, therefore, there be still found among
individuals obtrusive indications of ten-
dencies to violent, dishonest, and tortuous
methods, sicklied over with a cant of extenu-
ating justification, the explanation will pro-
bably be found in the prevalence of such
vices, writ large and in high places. This
condition has only to be looked for to be
found. There is not a civilised State, or
what is termed in the snuffle language a
Christian nation, which does not constantly,
methodically, and deliberately practise, as a
State, most of those flagrant crimes the com-
mission of which by its citizens as individuals
it punishes. But such States do a worse
thing than committing those crimes. They
expect, require, and encourage their most
honored rulers and dignitaries to justify the
perpetration of every national transgression.
So much so that any citizen who exposes the
immorality of such acts is placed under a
ban. He is regarded as unpatriotic, disre-
putable, and evil-minded. No such individual
can hope to be honored or prosperous. Thus,
for example, no clergyman of the Church
of England could hope to rise to be Arch-
bishop of Canterbury unless he made it plain
that no ridiculous scruples would prevent
him from mocking God with prayers for
blessings on armies proceeding to fight against
right and justice. Yet, such is the eccen-
tricity of principles, no clergyman could ex-
pect to give early and modest exhibitions of
his accommodating conscience by public dis-
plays of peculiar fervency of devotion when
imploring Divine favor for one of the prin-
cipals in a forthcoming prize-fight, or for a
burglar on the eve of a dangerous professional
expedition. The press, which has more
influence than the clergy in countries where
it is not subjected to authorative censorship,
is even more to blame, because equal induce-
ments to depravity do not assail it. There
seems no absolute reason why it would not
have been as profitable for the great daily
newspapers of London to have plainly ex-
hibited the predatory character of the South
African Chartered Company’s proceedings as
it was for Labouohere’s weekly Truth.
The same thing applies to the national pro-
ceedings in respect to Egypt. In times gone
by the case was similar with regard to the
East India Company and Hindostan.
* * * *
It is vain to imagine that habitual perver-
siop and depravation of the national con-
science can be practised without affecting the
conscience of individuals. No more striking
example of this inevitable connection between
cause and effect could be adduced than the
recent instance of the British official bard —a
most respectable citizen in every current
sense of the term—breaking out with en-
thusiastic conviction into warmly eulogistic
justification of Jameson’s filibustering raid
into the Transvaal. “Wrong? Was it
wrong ? ” chanted the Government poet, with
high moral challenge, and proceeded to
declare that that was right and even noble
which subsequently, by a most exceptional
chance, being subjected to the ordeal of a
criminal prosecution, was adjudged so
iniquitous as to require punishment. Had
the attempt to forcibly seize the Transvaal
been made by national troops instead of
by a force which could, in the event of
failure, be disowned, there could have been
no criminal prosecution and no cool exposi-
tion and pronouncement of the essential
iniquity of the enterprise. The whole nation
would have been incited by the weight and
authority of everything which is great, digni-
fied, solemn, and pious, to adjust its con-
science to the official sentiment conveyed in
the “Wrong? Is it wrong?” outpouring.
Nothing short of a diseased moral conscious-
ness can explain the mental condition of a
nation which breaks into a paroxysm of rage
at a foreign potentate because he expressed
sympathy with a community which had just
foiled an attempt upon its independence
under circumstances which a legal tribunal
afterwards declared to be criminal. This is
as if London exploded because the Lord
Mayor of Edinburgh congratulated Glasgow
upon the failure of a band of Cockney
burglars. And when one observes the same
people who raged about the German Em-
peror’s impertinent interference, working
themselves up into a condition of spasmodic
indignation because violence is committed
upon perfect strangers in Armenia by their
Sovereign, the unbalanced state of their
minds is exhibited. When Britons are
taught, day by day, by a shameless divorce
of words from their true significance, that
natives who revive a resistance to British
conquest of their country are rebels, whereas
British who resisted invasion would be pat-
riots ; that when such “rebels” are laid
dead in conflict they are merely killed,
whereas when they succeed in killing Bi’itons
it is a slaughter or a massacre ; that when
their own magnates threaten they are firm
and imposing, and when the magnates of
others are firm they are arrogant or insolent;
that a cavalry charge upon a crowd on camels
who drop their babies to scuttle the faster
out of reach, is a brilliant operation, whereas
an unexpected dash by the enemy is a
cowardly advantage ; it is impossible for
them to preserve their minds from a con-
fusion of ideas relative to right and wrong.
Other “ civilised ” and Christian nations are
every whit as bad. The English term
patriots who resist their aggression “rebels.”
The French have dubbed those natives of
Madagascar, who prolong the struggle for
independence, “bandits.” And wherever
the ruling class holds the press under sub-
jection the people are deluged with perverted
information and high-flown slander of the
antagonist of the hour.
*■ * V *
Yet, while thus deliberately infecting the
minds of the people with notions that wrong
may be right provided there be sufficient ad-
vantage attaching to it, governing classes
expect the persons thus confused to retain a
distinct perception of moral distinctions and
obligations in smaller matters. While these
are expected and trained to believe that the
Nation may steal and murder and lie and
betray on a magnificent scale provided the
expansion of its prosperity or its preserva-
tion from decadence would be imperilled were
it to abstain from such courses, they are
at the same time required to appreciate
and observe the nicest distinctions in their
conduct as private citizens. This is as-
suredly to demand a double-acting brain and
moral consciousness—an endowment which
mankind has not been gifted with. Once con-
fuse impressions of right and wrong on the
larger scale, and the confusion will affect
every action of a man’s life. Each individual
will set up within his own private constitu-
tion his own brain-laureate to sing “Wrong?
Is' it wrong ? ” and prove that it is right
whenever self-interest will be served by the
perpetration of a crime. It is hopeless to
expect a nation to be constituted of persons
of clear sense of rectitude and consequent
practice of integrity, when as a whole it is
led to acts of violence and spoliation and
sedulously trained to enjoy the comforts of
hypocrisy.
The Revolting Doctors.
Jack Workman, as Sweater, seems anomalous.
His woes, his sufferings at the hands of cruel
taskmasters are the eternal theme of bards and
scribblers, and here he is himself charged with
being the hardest of taskmasters, most cruel of
tyrants ! Ludwig Bruck lays the charge, on
behalf of the medical men of Australia, and no
one in Australia has had a larger experience in
matters pertaining to the medical profession
“than Ludwig Bruck, editor of the Austra-
lasian Medical Directory.” The friendly
societies of this continent, with 71,218 mem-
bers, representing 284,872 souls, are mere
medical sweating-shops according to Mr.
Bruck. Dr. Blank, M.D., F.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.,
wears purple and fine linen, and fares sumptu-
ously every day ; has a nice house, stylish
conveyance, fashionable wife, and a cane with
a big gold knob on the end of it. He looks all
right; but looks are deceitful, says Mr. Bruck.
The lips smile as Dr. Blank’s cigar is with-
drawn to greet you, but the mind behind the
lips is flat h 1. The city barouche and the
country bu ggy are really galleys where Dr. Blank
tugs at his oar like any other slave, while the
MLU.1.0.0.F., and the A.0.P.Q., and the rest
of ’em stand behind, invisible, with invisible
whips, to keep .him tugging. Plain, ordinary,
eight-bob-a-day, bricklaying John Smith, with
a patch on his pants and a broken pipe in his
teeth, whom all the universe sweats, is actually
able to sweat a well-nurtured “professional
man”—by the might of co-operation.
* * • *
The analogies have amusing sides. The
doctors, who, as members of the tail-halted
class, may be supposed to be more or less in
sympathy with the capitalistic “ freedorn-of-
contract ” principle, complain bitterly that they
have no freedom of contract. It is work for the
friendly. societies, at the friendly societies’
rates, or starve —just as Jack Laborer has to
work for the syndicates, at the syndicates’
rates, or starve. But The Bulletin does not
remember having heard any medical voice raised
on behalf of shearers, or miners, or wharf-
laborers, out on strike against a cut in wages.
That shoe pinched the other fellow’s foot.
Those men had freedom of contract, nobody
forced them to take less than minimum wage ;
if they did, the option was theirs entirely— r
what were they grumbling about ?
* * * *
On Mr. Bruck’s estimate, the friendly socie-
ties of Australasia control the medical attend-
ance of 24 per cent, of the population, and pay
on an average lOd. per visit or consultation—
some as little as 4£d. The ordinary friendly
society is really little more than a sick and
funeral club. Occasionally there is an attempt
at sociality in occasional meetings ; but the
essence of the organisation is the combination
of its members to pay a small regular subscrip-
tion in order to get medical attendance at much
less than the usual medical charges, with pos-
sibly an added weekly subsidy during illness
and a small cash sum at death. The system, of
course, is an offshoot from the long-established
English system —which, by-the-by, is periodi-
cally subject to just such revolts of the doctors
as Mr. Bruck wishes to bring about here. The
revolt is merely a phase of the capital v.
labor contest familiar all the world over,
with the curious and interesting difference
that the dog who is below at all
other times is for once on top. And as
human nature is identical in all classes of
society, it follows that the top dog bites and
the (medical) bottom-dog howls just as if their
places were reversed. The collective workman
develops a capacity for tyranny identical with
that of the collective employer, and justifies
himself by precisely the same argument :
“ Well, here’s the billet. Take it or leave it.
We don’t force you. We’ll give you so much
wages.” Or, if the doctor tenders, “at union
rates.” “We can’t recognise union rates. We
must take the lowest tender. The lowest ten-
derer may be a blackleg. It’s no business of
ours. He, like you, has freedom of contract.”
Beautifully consistent thing, this human nature !
* * * *
And the results? Mr. Bruck prints some,
which are especially severe on the mean person
with the good income, who joins the lodges as
an “ honorary member ” in order that he may
sweat the doctor for a few shillings a year :
The best-known friendly societies* medical institute in
Sydney pays four doctors £250 per annum each (with
right of private practice) to attend about 11,736 persons.
This institute boasts among its members an ex-Minister
of the Crown, and on one occasion the wife of a Minister
of the Crown called with five children, for each of whom
she required treatment and medicine.
The largest institute in Australasia is at Balmain (Syd-
ney) with 3000 members, paying 7s. 6d per member for
treatment and medicine for about 12,000 souls. Three
doctors get £l5O a year each, and divide a £450 pool
among them in proportion to prescriptions written.
During the year ended Nov. 30, *95, the doctors got 4jd.
for each consultation or visit. “ This dispensary,” says
Mr. Bruck, “ can boast of a live Minister of the Crown,
with a salary of £1370 a year, as one of its members, who
is not slow to avail himself of the dispensary doctor’s ser-
vices—at 6s. a year—whenever his family requires medical
aid. Of course, if he prefers the dispensary doctor he is
perfectly right in sending for him ; but a man in his ele-
vated position, entitled to the prefix ‘ honorable,’ might
justly and fairly be expected to send a cheque for a hand-
some amount to the doctor when his services are no
longer required, and the doctor is still looking forward to
such an agreeable surprise. What the medical officers of
this institution have to put up with the following inci-
dent shows One of them, soon after being appointed to
the post, received an urgent message from the wife of a
member, an accountant to a public company, who draws
a salary of £5OO a year ; on calling at the house he was
told by the lady that she sent for him to let him know' that
her case required ‘special’ attention, then introducing
her son—a strapping young fellow' of 18 summers—she
intimated that he, being in delicate health, also required
‘ special ’ attention, and finally producing her daughter,
who, she said, w'as suffering from a painful corn—here the
doctor cut the lady short, and left the house in disgust;
but fancy, ‘ special ’ medical attendance to a whole family
at the rate of 6s. a year ! ”
* * * *
And so on. There is an obvious fallacy in
this, of course. The doctor does not really
contract to attend one family at 6s. a year. He
contracts to attend a large number of families
at (say) =£3oo a year. When he makes his con-
tract he practically considers all the lodge-
members as a single family, and lumps rough
and smooth together. Consequently he has no
right to pick out the very roughest spot of all
and beat his breast and cry “0 miserable me !”
There are doubtless compensations. Very pos-
sibly some rare families do not trouble the
doctor at all, in which case he receives his
yearly shillings for doing nothing. He sees
clearly that this is not injustice. Neither is
the instance at the other end of the scale. The
whole point is : Are the doctors sufficiently
paid taking things all-round ? On Mr.
Bruck’s figures, and taking his estimate that
a medical man can only properly make some
25 visits a day (surely an under-estimate?),
they are not. Consequently The Bulletin,
while it waits to hear the other side of the
story, sympathises with them as it sympathises
with all under-paid laborers. Mr. Bruck
has a scheme for establishing doctors’ private
lodges, which anybody can join on paying (say)
1 or 2 per cent, of annual income, receiving in
return medicine and attendance for his family
for the year. The project seems an excellent
one. Nobody with 10s. 6d. to spare grudges it
to a doctor—even if the doctor only feels a
pulse and looks wise—but the doctor can doubt-
less afford to feel pulses at a good deal lower
rate in consideration of a quantity-guarantee.
The lodges give him this, and cut him down to
4|d. per visit. If he is prepared to establish a
union-rate of, say, 9d. to 55., sliding according
to incomes, is there any self-respecting work-
man who will grudge it to him ?


The Specially Protected Bank Director.
The prosecution of the City of Melbourne Bank
directors was still proceeding, in an apologetic
sort of way, when The Bulletin went to press.
Proceedings up to that time had been full of
ridiculous interest. They opened with a long
and feeble address by the Crown counsel, after
which came a hollow-sounding examination of
witnesses, and the mornings and afternoons of
the trial had amounted to about a fortnight
when the first inevitable difficulty arose in the
form of a legal question as to whether one of
the jurymen wasn’t ineligible to record a vote.
A collapse of the case, though expected
by the Melbourne public, whose instinct re-
garding financial prosecutions has generally
been correct, did not occur, and the case for the
Crown advanced slowly to a spiritless conclu-
sion. Thereupon the defence came forward
with a merry little twinkle in its eye to de-
mand the instant relief of the indicted parties
on a point of law. It seems that section 160
of the Act “provides that no person shall be
liable to be convicted by any evidence whatever
in respect of any act done by him if he shall, at
any time previously to his being charged with
such offence, have first disclosed such act on
oath.”
* * * *
The bearing of this peculiar legal arrange-
ment seems to be —as Captain Cuttle would
have said —in the application of it. Some
months ago there was an Insolvency Court
examination of the C. of M. Bank directors,
whereat they did disclose, on oath, certain acts
for which they are now being prosecuted. Said
disclosure, on oath, made the subsequent crimi-
nal charge, as regards those certain and highly -
important acts, a legal scandal. The whole of
the Crown case relating to matters that had
been previously disclosed in the Insolvency
Court is wiped out by section 160 aforesaid.
Therefore, The Bulletin pauses to ask what
the people of Victoria think of a Crown prose-
cution that wastes many days in discussing
matters which are exempted from judicial con-
sideration by virtue of their having been
revealed beforehand.
* * * *
A fog of legal argument partially obscures
the true awfulness of this trial from laymen’s
eyes, but there shines through the murky air a
statement made by Judge Holroyd on Thurs-
day last. Thus the learned Judge :
With regard to the construction of section 160, if it
should be necessary, I shall be prepared to reserve certain
questions of law upon the point raised by learned counsel
for the directors. I think the same point was also
taken for the auditors, namely, whether I should direct
the jury at this stage, that none of the prisoners, can he
convicted by reason of this section. I think there is some
evidence to go to the jury, but I am a good deal puzzled
in coming to a conclusion by the fact of the evidence con-
tained in the depositions (viz., the directors’ original dis-
closures on oath) havinq been practically now withdrawn
(by the Crown). I find it excessively difficult to discrimi-
nate between what is evidence in these depositions and
what additional evidence has been adduced subsequently
(i.e., in the Criminal Court for the first time). I shall re-
quire to examine it more closely to see what there is in
the supplementary evidence, and whether it supplies
facts that can be submitted to the jury. _ For the present
I shall content myself with saying there is some evidence
to go to the jury.
J udge Holroyd, it is clear, does not perceive
much evidence over and above the evidence
contained in these depositions, which the Crown
has “ practically now withdrawn.” One care-
ful glance at his Honor’s remarks will suffice to
set any common or garden kind of intellect
wondering why the City of Melbourne Bank
directors allowed themselves to run any risk of
conviction. All they had to do when they were
examined on oath in the Insolvency Court was
to “disclose” every act they had ever committed
in bank management —to pour forth all the
secrets of their souls and leave nothing to be
disclosed by anybody else : they should have
told (on oath) everything that could be charged
to their discredit, and then the present prose-
cution would have been doomed to terminate in
a fiasco. At time of writing, it seems just pos-
sible that the gentlemen, forgot to disclose on
oath, previous to being indicted, some stray
odds and ends of damaging circumstances that
may perchance give them trouble.
* » * *
Section 160 of the blessed Act was seemingly
intended to give bank-directors a means of pre-
serving themselves from annoyance. It invites
all issuers of doubtful balance-sheets to hurry
up and declare on oath that the figures were
not correct, whereby they deprive the Crown
of all excuse for starting a false-balance-sheet
prosecution. Such is the Victorian law relating
to joint-stock companies, as far as The Bulle-
tin can understand it. Perhaps it is the law
elsewhere. Let us hope so for the sake of all
worthy people who control the public cash in
banks. Section 160 is peculiar to the law for
the maintenance of financial morality, it will be
observed. A successful house-breaker cannot
put himself beyond the law’s reach by the
simple device of swearing to his burglary before
the police have got a warrant for his arrest.
Nor does a murderer escape punishment by
confessing his crime ere it has been discovered.
In all other lines of criminal law procedure the
suspected party is warned that any statement
he cares to volunteer may be used in evidence
against himself, but in view of probable prose-
cution for uttering a false balance-sheet a
director is warned, by Section 160, to say all he
knows and leave no evidence whatsoever to be
used against him by the Crown.
Snavelling Tasmania.
Private enterprise is making a big bite at
Tasmania just now. So religiously is the fetish
worshipped in the Land of Sleep a Lot, that
the raspberries of the future will ripen solely
by permission of a chartered syndicate if some-
thing isn’t done about it. Concessions to rail-
way and tram co’s are granted with as much
prodigality as if Tasmania were a vast continent
of boundless acreage instead of a miserable little
allotment of 20,0005 q. miles, mostly refractory.
The V.D.L. Railway Co. already has a mono-
poly of thousands of acres of mineral land, the
exact locality and value of which is only guessed
at. The boundaries of many of the land con-
cessions bestowed on railway co’s have been left
conveniently undefined and need not be fixed
for four or five years, or until private prospectors
(by permission) discover the whereabouts of the
portions rich enough to be worth claiming by
the syndicates. Other valuable inducements to
foreign capital have been scattered around in
the same large and loose manner, the main ex-
cuse being that the Govt, is too poverty-stricken
to do aught but give the utmost encouragement
to the British investor. And he is encouraged.
A tram co. has the right to Hobart streets for
ever !
* » * •
Several rival s,udicale* «io now ousy en-
gineering through the local Parliament land-
grab railways to the W T est Coast. Our old
friend, the Australasian Rights Purchase Co.,
turns up with a modest request for leave to
secure water-power apparently sufficient to run
an electric tramway to Tophet and to electric-
ally illuminate the Valley of the Shadow of
Death. The one million acres of land also
required is a trifle hardly worth mentioning.
An English syndicate requests a State guaran-
tee of 2 per cent, on £1,000,000 —the estimated
cost of the railway—and a quarter million
acres of real estate to be picked from four times
the area specially reserved for the purpose.
The agents of foreign syndicates daily indicate
their willingness to run the province at similar
dirt-cheap rates, and graciously offer to assume
all the responsibilities of Government and build
a rickety railway to the alleged golden West
for the privilege of collecting tribute from the
rising generation. And, at the tail-end of the
session, a Parliamentary committee is working
night and day to hurry up a report on some of
these beneficial proposals. Every political
crow is quorking in strict accordance with the
size of his prospective morsel of meat, and the
majority of Tasmaniacs devoutly pray that
Foreign Capital will not be driven away by the
stupidity of M’sP. or the aggressive honesty of
Ministers.
* * * *
The local papers, mostly dragged like half-
choked dogs at the axle-tree of Private Enter-
prise, take sides for one or other of the syndi-
cates, or, at best, express mild astonishment at
the size of the concessions asked for. This
attitude predicates or allows of unqualified
support to the foreign investor when the grabs
are—as they will be, of course—modified and
reduced in circumference. Any proposal that
the State should itself build the line and
thus give its present limited railway system a
chance to reduce its annual loss, is scarcely
ever hinted at even in jest. Such a suggestion,
made seriously, would be an unwonted inter-
ference with Private Enterprise that insular
conservatism could not be expected to survive
without swallowing its teeth or getting its face
tied in a knot.
* * * *
Poor little Tasmania suffers from a startling
succession of blunders stupendous enough to
sink a province less richly endowed by climatic
conditions and mineral wealth. The Convict
System, including Governor Arthur’s famous
£40,000 nigger battue ; the Main Line Railway
mess ; the V.D.L. Bank horror ; the V.D.L.
Waratah - Zeehan Railway muddle ; Mount
Lyell ditto ; the Hobart Tramway snavel, are
just a few cheerful items in a century-long
list of crimes committed by somebody, and
suffered for by everybody, and the end of the
list is evidently not yet.
* * * *
All this is most important to Australia;
for, in view of Federation, the growth of
shameless monopoly-booming in the Land of
Sleep a Lot becomes part of the federal pro-
spect and has to be reckoned with. Premier
Braddon and Treas. Fysh both violently cham-
pion Federation when on the stump. Their
protestations will go for little should they
allow their province to be pirated by foreigners.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Disgrace of Victorian Justice.
The disgraceful case of Widow Kilpatrick and
infant versus Huddart, Parker and Co., hav-
ing exhausted the possibilities of injustice in
Victoria, is about to set sail for England, and
plumb the depth of justice in the Privy Council.
Huddart, Parker and Co. are a wealthy firm
of shipowners; Widow Kilpatrick is a poor
woman, who relies for the support of herself
and her child upon her own efforts and upon
God and God seems too busy watching
sparrows fall to look after poor women as He
ought to. When Widow Kilpatrick’s husband
was alive he supported her, but he is dead,
and Huddart, Parker and Co. are held respon-
sible for the killing of him. Not intentionally,
not willingly, not knowingly, but, as two Vic.
juries have decided, carelessly. They owned
an unseaworthy steamer called the Alert, in
which Widow Kilpatrick’s husband went to
sea. Many unseaworthy ships come back to
port, and justify the confidence of ship-
owners in Providence and the chapter
of accidents ; but the Alert must have
been rather too unseaworthy, or Providence
and the chapter of accidents were full, for she
went to the bottom. Widow Kilpatrick’s
husband naturally went with her. Now, Vic-
toria has, in “ The Marine Act, 1890,” a law
which makes shipowners responsible for the care-
less killing of their servants and others, and
Widow Kilpatrick sued Huddart, Parker
and Co. for damages. Not for the loss of her
husband—there is no sentiment in the law—but
for the loss of her husband’s services, for the
money-value of him, the want of which threw
herself and her child penniless on the world.
Huddart, Parker and Co. are a wealthy firm
of shipowners, and they naturally defended the
action. A jury of six gave a verdict against
them, and assessed the money-value of Widow
Kilpatrick’s husband at ,£6OO. But Victorian
law offers every opportunity for a wealthy liti-
gant to ruin a poor one, and defeat justice by
fighting a suit from plea to plea, and from
court to court—though the action of Huddart,
Parker and Co. has, of course, throughout
been undoubtedly based on their conscientious
conviction that the Alert was not unseaworthy,
and consequently there was no just claim
upon them—and Huddart, Parker and Co.
appealed for a second trial. It was granted ;
the case was heard all over again ; and a second
jury of six gave Widow Kilpatrick £791
damages for the loss of her husband. Then
Huddart, Parker & Co. appealed for a third
trial. With some indecision, and by three
votes to two, the Full Court refused a third
trial. This is where Judge Hodges comes in.
Judge Williams heard the first trial; Judge
Hodges the second. In the second trial coun-
sel for Huddart, Parker, k Co., believing in
the justice of their cause, naturally thought
themselves warranted in taking any point,
however trivial or technical, which might upset
the adverse verdict of a stupid jury. So they
objected that “the pleadings”—the statement
of Widow Fitzpatrick’s case —were in one
respect not quite so full as they ought to be.
They were precisely the same pleadings as at
the first trial, where they had not been called
in question, and the Judge granted leave to
amend them. Huddart, Parker, & Co.’s coun-
sel admitted that the amendment did not alter
the aspect of the case in any way. The Full Court
subsequently decided it was an amendment
which Judge Hodges was bound to allow. And
the jury, as before said, gave widow Kilpatrick
a verdict. Then Judge Hodges told her that in
consequence of this formal amendment, this
technical amendment, this amendment which
did not alter the situation, this amendment
which the court was bound to permit, she
would have to pay all the costs of the first
trial—the trial which she had won—her own
costs and Huddart, Parker’s costs as well.
And Judge Hodges refused leave to appeal
against this order. Widow Kilpatrick
appealed nevertheless, and different members
of the Full Court characterised it as oppressive
and unreasonable, and the whole court reversed
it. Widow Kilpatrick was ordered merely to
pay the costs of her amendment —which are
nil. Now Huddart, Parker and Co. are ap-
pealing to the Privy Council; but as the Full
Court might have refused to adopt the very
unusual course of revising, without his leave,
a Judge’s order as to costs, Widow Kilpat-
rick is still astonished at her good luck, and
begins to hope that possibly in fettered
monarchical England she may possibly get the
price of her dead husband which free and
democratic Victoria by its judicial institutions
practically refuses her.
“An Attempted Compromise.”
Under the aforesaid newspaper heading another
instance of the Law working to increase legal
expenses was reported from Melb. Practice
Court last week. A breach-of-promise case, in
which plaintiff, being an infant, sued through
her father for £lOOO damages from the fickle
lover, came before Judge Hodges in the form
of an application for leave to compromise.
Actions for breach-of-promise are optional with
the ladies, and to accept a compromise is not to
compound a felony or do anything illegal. Con-
sequently, in the first place, there was no com-
monsense reason why a question of settling this
ease out of court should be submitted to Judge
Hodges. Nineteen out of every twenty jilted
maidens don’t sue for damages at all in public,
though some of them may make private terms
with a lawyer’s assistance. However, this
particular girl having started to take action
through her father, the defendant made an offer
of £75 consolation, which amount seemed suf-
ficient to the man who is responsible for plain-
tiffs costs— viz. , the father. In short, there
was no cause why the father and the defendant
shouldn’t arrange the £75 agreement between
them, leaving the girl to endorse it, or not, just
as she might think fit, without being compelled
to “consult” his Honor in the meantime.
What right has the Law to interfere in any
settlement of this financial matter out of court,
and what was the result of its decision ? More
costs. Judge Hodges said he was not pre-
pared to sanction the compromise until he had
an affidavit as to the girl’s views. Further ex-
pense. Next day the affidavit came along and
settled the matter as proposed.
The “ Dispersers.” ,
The Queensland “native police” is to be abol-
ished “as an aggressive force.” If this is
“ honest Injin,” it is equivalent to abolishing
the native police altogether. Lurid traditions
condemned to death! The older “civilised”
savageries, when a “ magistrate ” (generally a
squatter, or squatter’s barnacle), bent on whole-
sale massacre of niggers, would, within ambush
of an unsuspecting camp, formally read the
Riot Act (!)—in English and to the scrub under-
growths—and then despatch his naked and oiled
assassins to “ do their duty,” ceased some years
ago. But the later brutalities of potting blacks
alleged to have been guilty of cattle-spearing,
or provision-pilfering, have been in full blast up
to date. Blacks have been officially reported
as “ dispersed ” in the far North, right up to
the times of shearers’ strikes. “Dispersed”
is native-police for cold - blooded butchery.
Officials of the system declare that it has made
strides in humanity. Just so. The native
policeman does not now shoot down young gins
promiscuously ; he otherwise uses them. That
the gins nowadays do not fear nor expect death
from the native police is well-known to anyone
who has of late years seen a blackfellows’ camp
surprised. The gins and pioaninnies all rush
to a central space and huddle down together
with their arms outstretched above their heads,
to show that they are gins and picaninnies and
are unarmed. But it is arguable whether it is
not as cruel to kill the gins’ male protectors,
and leave the gins to get along without them,
as it would be to kill them all off in short order.
Now, however, Father Tozer, as the “Home
Secretary” for Queensland, has become Pro-
tector of the Aborigines, and is going to try his
hand at taming them in reserved settlements.
The Queensland blacks will be taught to sing a
new National Anthem—
Gorsave our grashy Toze,
Long lib him gib it clo’s,
Gorsend it rum, &c.
Judge Williams the other day treated a Mel-
bourne audience to a long discourse on the
happiness and unhappiness of married life with-
out once mentioning the all-important word
money. What a foolish learned Judge it is !
The path to domestic bliss is paved with domes-
tic comfort. Cash huys comfort, also the
materials for good temper, good taste, and warm
animal affection, which are a good cook and
frequent change of scene. A millionaire isn’t
worried into whacking his daintily-dressed,
sweetly-perfumed, carefully-massaged wife,
whilst she, for her part, has many reasons,
denied to poor Betsy Jane, for wanting to lmg
her old man in moderation. Even in compara-
tively struggling circumstances of life a woman
gets the chief secret of “ happy unions ” re-
vealed to her when she returns home after a
month in the country to find her husband much
fonder of her than usual. Happy unions consist
mostly of happy reunions, impossible among
the poorest couples, with whom affection lapses
into a state of coma for want of being refreshed
by healthy absences one from another.
Characteristic epistle from “ Scotty the
Wrinkler ” :
Dear Bulletin,— Concerning “ Label Frauds.” Are not
all, or very nearly all, brands known to be frauds ? The
king is not cunning, not often. Monday is not the moon’s
day. A duke is no dux. A C.M.G. knows not Mick or
the dragon-slayer. Superior anything is superior indeed
to any worse or worser sort. Old cognac is old compared
to newer. Ketchup of the finest quality is made of de-
cayed horse-flesh. A finer brand is made of the livers,
and an inferior stuff is got from mushrooms. Pineapple
essence (and all the rarer flavorings) are extracted from
coal-tar. Malt and white-wine vinegar are dilute acetic
acid. Caviare is no longer Russian sturgeon roe, but the
guttage of Newfoundland fishing-smacks. Pdti-de-foie-
yras is ptite-de-quelque-chose. Ivory handles are bone.
The difference between pork and beef sausages is a half-
penny a pound and the fact that there is more mutton-fat
and bread in the former. Not long ago I heard a butcher
tell the slaughterman to make a sheep into a lamb. The
operation is easy : Throw the caul-fat over the legs, put a
stick through flanks and behind back, and cut four gashes
on the thigh. The oldest stag is thus prime fat lamb and
worth a penny a pound more than before. The gourmand
of Narandera has returned a leg of mutton to get its mate
(gashed and fatted) as lamb. Hare-soup is easiest made
of liver, celery, and nutmeg. Christians are fraud-
heathens. Heathens are often Christians. A doctor does
not teach ; a minister is no servant; a policeman has no
manners ; a justice of the peace is an unjust fomenter of
strife; gentlemen are uncouth cads; sportsmen are
poachers and pot-hunters; races are not to the swift. In
fact, as some defunct Frenchman puts it: “ Language
(labels) is aiven us for the purpose of concealing our
thoughts.” The colonial “lydy’s” mispronunciation is
for once appropriate. “ This isn’t English ile, although
it’s on the libel.” Note also that the only draught Eng-
lish ale in Narandera is M‘Ewan’s (Scotch), and drawn at
the Railway Hotel, so called because it’s a mile from the
terminus.
What is to be done about the fearful evil of
church bazaars, which are such pitfalls in the
paths of youths ? Yet another soul dragged
down to the abyss of peculation appeared before
the Melb. City Court last week, his native
innocence soiled by the wiles of the Church. A
slab of the proceedings :
The P.M. : There is no country in the world where so
much of this sort of thing [peculation] goes on as here.
(To witness.) What were his habits like? —He seemed to
be a respectable youth.
Did he say where the money had gone ?—I asked him if
he spent it playing billiards or in drink. He denied that
he went in for those things, and said that some of the
money had been spent at church bazaars.
Is there no honor, no patriotism in the land,
that will stamp out this festering plague-spot
so contagious to the contiguous youth ? Is
there no Jawbone Neild to cry “Eftsoons!”
to this nocent waterspout ? No Fitz Gibbon
who will build gutters for this smellful sewage?
No right-thinking person who will form a
league to put down church bazaars ?
The howling revolutionary fanatic is the tin-
kettle tied to the tail of Decent Reform by
Ancient Corruption. The public generally
hears the tin-kettle and nothing else.
Prayer for latter-day Reformers :—“Give us,
O Lord, not the millennium in our time, but
only such instalments thereof as our poor
terrestrial stomachs can digest.”
The thin edge of compromise is the begin-
ning of political wisdom.
The policy of the “ whole hog or none ” is an
admirable one . . . jor the hog. He re-
mains whole, whole and hearty, and never parts
with even one poor slice of concessionary bacon.
Some men are Radicals because the Shears of
Reform cannot possibly rob them of anything.
The only wool they have grows over their eyes.
P. Luftig.
Some Melb. University councillors threaten the
Minister of Education that if any more Govt,
grant is lopped off they will surrender the in-
stitution to "the control of his department.
Perhaps it were as well, in the interests of
democracy, to lop off some more, just to bring
the threat into operation. The University is
mainly at present a seedling-bed for prigs,
professional men, and Nice people, and not in
any sense, what is was intended to be, an insti-
tution for the sound education of all classes in
the community. What economic intelligence,
for instance, can be looked for in the well-to-do
classes of a country w'hen an adherent of the
exploded Cobdenite superstition supplies the
whole economic pabulum of its “ gilded youth ” ?
The cast-iron conservatism of the crowd run-
ning the show positively refuses to adapt the
institution to the fact that Australia is a
working community. For instance, it refuses
to disturb the social engagements of its pro-
fessors and bon-ton students by having its lec-
tures at times when the people who pay for it
can attend. And till the State takes the con-
cern over there is little chance of either a free
University or a night-lecture one.
Members of Tas. Assembly have just decided
that ,£5O per annum and “perks” is not
enough pay for legislative toilers, and express
an intention to revert to thepre-trenchmentmini-
mum wage of £lO0 —also the “ perks.” Even in
the Land of Sleep a Lot the Great Unpaid is
more than suspected of paying itself, and the
wage-sheets cannot be audited. The return to
the £loo—miserably insufficient in itself—is an
indication that something like a living wage
will be paid to members in the near future.
That adequate payment of members is a sine
qua non of any brand of democracy doesn’t
seem to have struck Tasmania hitherto. For
that matter, it hasn’t struck her particularly
hard yet, but when Treas. Fysh casually men-
tions that free postage and free telegrams sent
to and from and by the influence of legislators
costs some £5OOO or £6OOO per annum, the tax-
payer vaguely wonders whether cheap legisla-
tive labor is so very cheap, after all.
Originally the term “Freetraders" was
applied to the smugglers and small pirates of the
Isle of Man. Still, they were decent, men com-
pared to the traitors who yield their country’s
workers, body and soul, to the grisly mercies of
the greedy Jap., the leprous Chow, and the spider-
legged Hindoo.

The end of Nat Goodwin’s Australian
season, is very near, and one parts from his co.
with real regret. On the whole, they have not
received here the patronage they merited. Per-
naps to Some extent they are an acquired taste :
both in Sydney and Melbourne they opened badly,
and closed just when a growing appreciation would
have liked them to stay a little longer. Yet final
impressions chiefly accentuate first impressions.
.Nat Goodwin himself is undoubtedly a treasure
of comedy original, humorous, frequently en-
chanting. He has emotional strength, too, but
lacks the face and figure for tragedy : his inter-
polated tragic glimpses hover always on the edge
of anti-climax.. What he needs is a better actress
to play up to him, ri val him, and now and then
eclipse him. Maxine Elliott has justly impressed
Australian audiences as stiff, monotonous, wanting
life and force. Quite unexpectedly, in “An
American Citizen,” she became delightful,
fascinating. It was in the scene where the
married, unwedded pair (see “The Ironmaster”)
are thrown awkwardly together in the wife’s
apartments. Miss Elliott (Beatrice Carew) is
dressing ; her maid is out; and her dress fastens
down the back. Goodwin (Beresford Cruger)
proffers assistance. But “ Oh, no ! no ! ” cries
Miss Elliott, in half-earnest flight round the
room,, with Goodwin sportively following her.
The idea is crude enough, and might easily be
vulgarised. But in Miss Elliott’s checked
laughter, her feminine tremors, her mots entre-
coupes, her blushes and hesitations, an audience
which knew her forabeautiful woman was permitted
to guess how in certain situations she would be a
woman exceedingly charming. But she is no
actress, she cannot simulate another’s indi-
viduality ; and, if she were wise, instead of trying
to mould herself to her part she would be herself
all the time—show as much of herself as possible—
and let the part mould itself to her.

It is carious to see how the old English
fetish of the stock company, with its leading
gentleman and leading lady, its heavy father and
soubrette and the rest, is worshipped in the best
theatres of America, long after the best English
playwrights and acting-managers have' sent it
permanently to the provinces. Nat Goodwin’s
plays keep strictly to the American convention;
his company is selected individual by individual
with a strict eye to fitness in filling the conven-
tional rdles. On the whole it is a very decent
company, conscientious at rehearsal, hard-working
at performances, and playing well up to a good
second-rate standard. The occasional lapses to
third-rate are quite rare enough to be exceptional.
Of the ladies, Ethel Browning and Estelle Morti-
mer have left the best impression—the former
quaint, clever, and provoking ; the latter vigorous,
competent, and filling a very useful foil-part
throughout the play-series. The gentlemen
are merely good enough. Frazer Coulter is
reliable, but lacks variety; Clarence Handy-
side is unfortunate in filling the “ Bless-you-
my-children ” rdle which grates on Australian
minds with a- gross, melodramatic suggestion, in-
clined to be comical. And the whole company are
more at ease and more effective when their feet
are on their native heath, and their noses curl
round their native brogue. Perhaps they do not
act better “ In Mizzoura ” than in the comedy of
N York life, but “In Mizzoura ” is a very line,
moving drama, and in it Nat Goodwin and co.’
made their highest flight—probably flew to their
highest potentiality. How does “In Mizzoura ”
strike the Mizzourian himself? Perhaps there is
in it a shade of extravagance, a choice of incidents
unusual rather than typical; but it could not be
entirely false, and, as played to us, it seemed
almost, entirely true. It is with that play that
the departing visitors will be linked in pleasant
Australian memory.
* * * *
“An American Citizen,” the first-time-on-
play by Madelaine Riley, which was
given at Sydney Criterion on Saturday, is in itself
not too good, hardly more than good enough ; but,
capably handled, proves an agreeable evening’s
acquaintance. The central conception is of a
couple married for monetary reasons, separated
immediately after the ceremony because the bride
loves another (though the groom loves her), and
united in the last act after the usual number of
obstacles and interruptions—some of which are
diverting enough. Nat Goodwin, as usual, has
three-fourths of the jam—it is delightful to be an
actor-manager and spread your own bread ; but he
fairly earns two-thirds of it. There is a pretty
scene at Nice, and a pathetic scene in London,
artfully disposed to touch the same old stops in
the same old way; and, taken all round (and
especially considering the glimpses of Miss Elliott
the woman) the result is quite satisfactory. And
the Lyceum orchestra, directed by W. T. Rice, is
a delight to listen to.
** * *
“ Gentle Gertrude,” produced for the first
time in Australia at Sydney Criterion on Satur-
day night, is a melodious melodrama of the grim
and gory type, and depends altogether for success
on the way in which the performers enter into the
spirit of the thing. As played and sung by
Brough, Harry Hi 11, Emma Temple and Katherine
Hardy, it is hugely funny—and the first-night
audience evidently thought so. Gertrude
(Miss Hardy) is called gentle because of her
simple artless way of insinuating large draughts
, vociferously-labelled poison into moneyed young
lord lings, who seek shelter at her father’s inn.
-Brough was capital as the innkeeper, who is
getting tired of the business of midnight murder
and would give it up but for his Lady Macbeth of
a wife He ultimately tires of his wife, too, and
tries to slay her with assorted weapons, such as
daggers, firelocks and mortars, until the stage is
an armoury; but Emma Temple, as Mrs. Gowk-
rod go r, is hard to kill, and cheerfully takes an
encore after the final explosion. Everybody lies
weltering in gore at last, except Gentle Gertrude
herself, who artistically poses beside the slaugh-
tered noble and his money-bags, but the corpses
obligingly revive to help her through with a chorus
as she musically announces her intention of goino-
on with the business now that the old people have
retired. The incidental songs and quartettes
brighten the burlesque and go well, though Brough
does not now get his chest-notes off with the ease
of the Lord Chancellor ” days.
* * ’* *
In the “Pair of Spectacles” revival the
honors chiefly fell to Brough as Benjamin Gold-
finch, and Tithe radge as the pessimistic brother
Gregory-—which latter is really an artistic triumph.
qu 6 a; q ij a J,nt stinginesses of the “man from
ohetneld characterise him convincingly; his
very coat looks close-fisted. All the Hare-and-
Jvendalisms in the sentiments of the piece come
r'u fres * l and strong in this resuscitation.
Lily litheradgeis refreshingly natural, and makes
her little sparrow-moralising speech with sweet
sincerity. Harry Hill’s Percy shows that he is
coming on well as that very desirable stage-
character, a handsome young fellow who looks at
ease and talks like a gentleman, and Wakefield
was all right as the briefless barrister cousin.

Sydney Tivoli has lost its Cinematographe
and gained Jessica, Queen of the Slack-wire. ”
Jessica is a young lady to whom feet and legs and
other locomotive aids are apparently of no account.
Other people’s feet are reckoned among the things
that must be Put Down, but Jessica is not in the
least particular whether she puts hers up on
a shivery wire 15ft. above the stage or 50ft.,
and the wire seems to know her and
them, and clings to her like a magnet,
or a long-lost brother, or a church canvasser, or a
bloV of tar. This affection enables Jessica to
stand on her head on nothing, while her toes
dangle enticingly over the sixpenny pit, and her
draperies dally between heaven and earth without
visible connection with either. As there is no-
thing in the wide world more attractive than a
young lady standing on her head in empty space,
the iivoli is gloriously crowded by an audience to
wnose ecstacies Alice Leamar and the superb John
Coleman, and a crowd of miscellaneous artists,
also attractively contribute.

These are the last nights of “ Foiled ” and
the murderous saw and Cosgrove’s brown suit and
gaiters at Sydney Majesty’s, and the sensation
for Saturday is “The Serpent’s Coil”-which
makes The Bulletin shiver with memory and
anticipation. The cinematograph is also
m its last nights. In prospect are Madame
Irebelh, the Sydney Amateur Operatic Co., and
the Potter-Bellew Co.

At Melb. Princess’s the rough-edged humor
of “ A Milk White Flag ” is less successful than
the brisk puerility of “Chinatown,” so the corpse
on ice has been sneezing at some rather poor
houses. Perhaps public opinion of the “China-
town ” co. had “ slumped ” before the end of then-
long run in the farce they knew so well and treated
with such easy familiarity. This would account
for a general tendency to look for weakness in the
present show, whereas the previous performance
was cheerfully accepted at the outset for consider-
ably more than it was worth. Hon. Hoyt s come-
dians in the bulk don’t shine under close inspec-
tion. But to Ihe Bulletin, which was never
dazzled by them, they appear much the same now
as at first, whilst their new piece, in point of
plot, jokes, and satire, seems a decidedly
less painful affair than the old one. The
idea of enrolling the corpse of a joint stock com-
pany promoter as a member of the Ransom e
Guards, and then raising his cold clay to the rank
of captain at an impromptu Council of War, for
the purpose of giving the regiment a grand funeral
incnic, is funnier than anything that happened in
‘ Chinatown. ” Moreover, the chorus in “ A Milk
White Flag ’’ is an intermittent joy, and the legs
of Miss Nellie Butler in tights deserve handsome
acknowledgement. There is time for another
boom to develop before the American season closes
on Oct. 30. A revival of “ Djin-Djin,” with a
considerably altered cast, and the Lumiere Cine-
matographe thrown in as an extra attraction, will
follow the “Flag.”

“ Tommy Atkins ” flourished until Satur-
day, at the Royal, and on Monday night the in-

drama are reserved for next issue, but, in the
meantime, a vote of thanks to the Rignold family
Jacques may be taken as read. Bloodthirsty

sion by William Rignold, is always one of brother

Monte has been absent for several-years, and
as a popular wreaker of vengeance before he
went away, the effect of him this time promises to
be very gratifying all round.

For some reason which holds the under-
standing of this journal at bay and defies reason-
abfe explanation, Harry Rickards is adding ,T W
Jrarsons to his list of attractions at Melb. Opera
Mouse for one consecutive night. This (Thursday)
is the memorable evening. J. W. Parsons it
seems will appear upon the stage and be demon-
strated over on a monster scale by an admiring
world that cabs him “Jack,” and feels proud-of
the land which gave him birth, and of the glorious
Victonansunshinewhidi glints upon his whirling
wheels when old Bilmartin is going one better.
Inis worship of Parsons’ commonplace legs, in
the presence of the Prantz Family, and the
Vaidis Sisters and La Belle Maie (not to
mention Crackles and Florrie Forde) calls for
careful analysis by a board of University pro-
fessors, or specialists from Yarra Bend. Just
now there is a glut of cyclists, most of whom
would probably learn to race a Parsons into an
early grave if they hadn’t other business to em-
jS'ffl Even “champions” are as
plentiful as blackberries, and Parsons isn’t a cham-
pion. However, on second thoughts, The Bulle-
rtiN exonerates Rickards from a mere desire to burn
incense before a tin god. The Monster Demon-
stration over ‘Jack” aforesaid is intended to
advertise- a,n Opera House cyclery where machines
may be left every evening free of charge. The
bike cloak-room opens to-night.

Book-Arcade Cole talks petulantly of quitting Melbourne

Saturday afternoon off. The Act will no doubt allow him
all the exemption he asks. Seeing that the Arcade sup-
plies music in the evening, and very good music, too, it
may claim to be classed as a place of entertainment.

In N.S.W. Assembly, last week, the some-time-
ago-crushed Patents Amendment Bill made a second ap-
pearance, coming via the Leg. Council. The essential
thin" - in it is the power given patentees to amend a
patent, and it is shrewdly suspected that the present and
pressing need of one or more N.S.W. patentees for such
amendment makes the Bill of far more than theoretical
moment. The Assembly passed the Bill, but knocked out
its retrospective action by 19 majority, so unkindly killing
all its practical value for the people who want it. And a
contributor behind the scenes writes
“,The real interests involved in the struggle over
Gould’s Patents Bill in N.S.W. Assembly are understood
by few outside Parliament and only by a minority of the
members. Apparently the opposition to the retrospective
aspect of the measure sprang from the fear that the Bill
would validate the cyanide patent and enable the Cassels
Co. to levy royalties on all persons using the process.
Actually it was based in the desire to prevent Ashcroft
(of the Sulphides Co., Cockle Creek) from amending a
technical error in his specifications, and thus making his
patent secure. There is to the knowledge of the writer,
at the present time, a gigantic syndicate being formed by
some Australian speculators in London for the purpose of
pirating the Ashcroft patent under cover of a supposed
technical flaw in the specifications. The cyanide cry was
skilfully used to frighten members into eliminating the
retrospective aspect of the measure under which Ashcroft
could have withdrawn the weak portion of his claims and
thus have substantiated the remainder.
“Gould’s Bill was a very simple affair, consisting
of two parts, both chunks from the Victorian Act, which
in turn is copied from the British law —probably the best
Patent Law extant. In Britain and every British colony
(except N.S.W.), in the United States, Canada and all the
larger countries of Europe, the law allows a patentee who
has made a mistake in his specifications or claims to
amend them under certain restrictions and with consent
of the Patents Office, and the first part of Gould’s Bill
was to allow a N.S.W. patentee to do likewise, provided
he did not add to his patent—Clause 2 enacted that “No
amendment shall be allowed that would make the specifi-
cation, as amended, claim an invention substantially
larger than, or substantially different from, the invention
claimed by the specification as it stood before the amend-
ment.” The second part of the Bill was merely a simplifi-
cation of the method of cancelling a cronk patent, and
did not arouse any particular interest. It was round the
first part that the battle raged, and it will probably rage
a lot more before all is over.
“Asa chain is only as strong as its weakest link,
so a patent is only as valid as its weakest claim : that is
the law all over the earth. But in every country except
N.S.W. if a patentee finds a weak link he can remove it,
and Gould only wanted to put a patentee in N.S.W. on
the same footing as in any other country, and no-
body would have tried to stop him were it not that
it is generally believed that Ashcroft’s patent has a weak
link in it, and a lot of people with a lot of money want
that weak link to stop where it is. That’s the position
to-day, no matter how it may be obscured with florid
rhetoric about “ the poor working miner,” who neither
knows nor cares a curse about it!
“As most people in N.S.W. (especially thelawyers
and'the politicians) are densely ignorant of the patent
law, it may be as well to give them a bit of information
about it. An inventor takes out a patent for a machine
whose mechanism consists of, say, five different combina-
tions. To secure himself from infringement he would
claim for each of these combinations separately , and then
for the lot altogether. Then after he gets his patent, it
turns out that one of his combinations is not new—that
it was in use before the date of his patent, though, un-
known to him, the claim embodying that particular com-
bination would be invalid, and therefore the whole patent
would be void. That’s the law everywhere, but anywhere
except in N.S.W. the patentee could withdraw the one
invalid claim, and his patent for the other four combina-
tions would stand.
“That’sthegeneral principle of Patent Law; now
for the particulars of the cyanide people’s patent. In
1888. the Cassels Co. patented all over the world the pro-
cess of extracting gold from powdered ore by means of
cyanogen. In Britain and South Africa they made two
claims—first for the general use of cyanogen in extracting
gold, second for a particular solution containing cyanogen
in specific quantities to be used in a particular manner—
as fully described in the specification. But in the Aus-
tralasian colonies they made only one claim—the general
one-claim No. lof the British patent. Why they did
not make the second claim is best known to themselves.
Their patent was challenged in Britain, and finally came
before ttie Court of Appeal, which held that the first claim
was too vague and general and therefore invalid, but that
their second was definite and good. Consequently, on
withdrawal of claim No. 1, No. 2 stands good in England
and S. Africa, but as No. 1 is the only claim in their Aus-
tralian patents it is clear they can’t withdraw that, and
they can’t amend it by making- it more definite as that
would be to make it “substantially different.” As a matter
of history, when they made a forlorn attempt to do so in
Vic. and Maoriland their application was incontinently
rejected. So far, therefore, as Australasia is concerned
there is no cyanide patent, and nothing in Gould’s Bill
could possibly have helped to create one. That disposes
of, the cyanide bogey—it was only a dummy, anyhow,
used-by a few “ fly ” people to frighten a lot of ignorant
ones, but it served the purpose !
“On Thursday (29th Sept.) Gould’s Bill passed
through Committee in the Assembly, the clause making
the Bill retrospective (i.e., allowing any of the 5000
people who now hold patents in N.S.W. to have the
benefit of the measure) being carried by a two-thirds
majority consisting of about equal proportions of all three
parties in the House. At next sitting the Bill was recom-
mitted, principally for the purpose of inserting a clause
to conserve the interests of anyone who might, at the
passing of the Act, be bona fide working any invention
covered by a patent then invalid but which might become
valid through the operation of the measure.
“But between Thursday and Tuesday something
had worked a mighty change in the spirit of the Assem-
bly. The retrospective clause was again attacked, this
time by the very men who had at the previous sitting
supported it, not one of whom gave a coherent reason for
his change of attitude. The cyanide bogey was again
galvanised into life, the “struggling miner” was again
delivered from some imaginary foe, and member after
member again expounded his awful ignorance of the
patent laws. Hurley gravely assured the House that if
the Bill were passed the present 12 months’ provisional
protection to patentees would be done away with. Lyne
thought the object of the Bill was to extend indefinitely
the term of provisional protection ; Cotton could see a
dark conspiracy against the liberties of the people in the
fact that no fee was to be charged to the patentee for
allowing him to amend his specification—one would have
fancied from the fervour of his denunciation that some evil
deal like the Colo Valley grab was being engineered.
Haynes asserted that the object of the Bill was “to
wring from the people something that by the advance of
science had become their property”—which sounded well,
anyhow.
“ Then an attempt was made by the Broken Hill
members to discredit the sulphide people. The fact that
one or two of them were mixed up in the strike seemed
a good reason why they should be deprived of their
patent, and to deprive them of their patent furnished as
sufficient justification for destroying the Bill. Cann
stated that ‘ Ashcroft was engaged by the Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. to experiment on the process of this
patent, that he was paid by this co. to carry on these
experiments, that as soon as he discovered it, he went to
England and floated a co. to work the process.’ Ferguson
was even more explicit, and asserted, as a matter of his
own knowledge, that “ Ashcroft had been paid by the Pro-
prietary Co. to experiment in the treatment of their ores,
and when he completed his invention he sold to an English
co. the rights the B.H. Proprietary Co. had paid him for.’
It seems reasonable to believe that Cann and Ferguson
are just the very men to whom the B.H.P. crowd would
confide the inner working of their business. The whole
statement is a pure invention, but still it is effective in
debate—it may not be the invention of the Broken Hill
members, bub that is immaterial. As a matter of fact,
Ashcroft, the writer is assured, holds an agreement
under seal made with the Proprietary Co., covenanting
that any discovery he might make while in their employ
should be his own ; and, further, it is in the knowledge of
the writer that the expense of Ashcroft’s experiments was
borne, not by the Proprietary Co., but by the men who
are now his partners in his patent. Eventually the vote
of the previous Thursday was reversed and the retrospec-
tive effect of the measure destroyed. It is possible the
matter may be settled through a conference with the Leg.
Council, but if the Bill becomes law in its present form
not one of the 5000 people who up to the present have
taken out patents in N.S.W. can benefit by it. Jones,
who took out a patent last week and made a technical slip
in his specifications, will lose his patent and cannot even
apply for a new one ; but Brown, who takes a patent out
next week, may amend his. And this is what ‘the most
democratic Assembly ever elected in N.S.W.’ calls
‘ written reason ’! 1 ”
This seems to describe the situation with fair
accuracy. There appears no equitable reason why Ash-
croft should not be allowed to amend his specification ;
and there is surely every reason why outsiders should not
be licensed to “jump” the product of his brains. Over
£20,006 was spent in experiments in England by the
people who are now backing Ashcroft before they con-
sented to back him and put up the hundreds of thousands
now invested in the big Cockle Creek establishment and
its appanages. Yet Ashcroft, despite the fact that he has
managed to get rich backers, is as much entitled to justice
as if he were the poorest and most prospectless man on
the N.S.W. list of inventors.
All the same, The Bulletin would be sorry to
see the Bill pass in its present form. Apart from its fishy
associations, it is too vague, and it puts far too much
power in the hands of a temporary politician like the
Minister of Justice. The appeal to English and other
precedents has little value. Most of these precedents
seem to have been recently created ; it does not appear
that they are entirely identical with the rule which it is
sought to establish in N.S. Wales; and, anyhow, the
question is entitled to be argued here on its merits. It is
not enough that England has taken a certain course :
point is, what effect a similar course is going to have
upon us.
And, mind you, there are patent experts who
are not at all convinced that the right to amend is desir-
able, or that it has worked well so far as tried. For, they
say, it tends to make a patentee careless and dishonest.
In this way. In pretty nearly every other walk of life, or
department of work, when a man makes a mistake he has
to suffer for it ; and the knowledge that he will suffer
sharpens him to make no mistake. Patent law is a
wilderness as it is : if you allow practically unhindered
amendment you will stimulate patentees to make the
wilderness tenfold more tangled, and stimulate a host of
unjust claims.
If a patentee is honest, and desires to claim no
more than he has actually invented, there is little fear of
him making a mistake. Knowledge is so quickly com-
municated now —in books, and newspapers, and scientific
periodicals, and special patent publications—that patent
experts in any branch of scientific invention all over the
world are pretty familiar with the exact state of progress
on any important line, and can refer to plenty of standard
authorities. An inventor who takes their advice, and is
checked by the Examiner of Patents and his experts, will
rarely go wrong. And it is not a “ tech'nioal ” error, in
the ordinary sense of the words, that can invalidate his
patent. As long as he has made his claim intelligible,
and has claimed precisely what he has invented and no
more, the Courts will see justice done to him.
But the average patentee, particularly if he is
backed by a wealthy syndicate, wants to grab the whole
earth —not only his particular invention, but every pos-
sible alteration or development or improvement on his
invention. Give him the earth, and he grabs the universe.
So he draws up his specification on what he calls
“ broad ” lines—that is, he claims not only vvhat he knows
he is entitled to, but things which he does not know
he is entitled to, and even things which he knows he is
not entitled to—relying on the chapter of accidents, and
the “right to amend” by withdrawing whatever —he is
made to. This is the trouble with the cyanide patentees.
They not only claimed the particular cyanide solution
which they were entitled to, but they wanted to grab the
whole area of uses of cyanogen—to establish a monopoly in
one of Nature’s elements, and force the whole world to
pay tribute ! Something of the same kind seems to be at
the bottom of the Ashcroft trouble —he has grabbed too
much. Your true patentee would patent air and sun-
shine, water and fire, if he thought people would stand it.
So that here is the difficulty. Admit that it is
highly unjust, supposing a man has made an error, to
deprive him of the fruits of his invention ; on the other
hand, it is highly unwise to give him carte blanche to make
as many errors as he likes—deliberate errors, all on his
own side—with the certainty of being able to avoid the
consequences if he is pushed. Already this “ right to
amend ” is being turned to account by wealthy syndi-
cates, who intentionally claim rights which they know
they cannot defend, and bully poor individuals into pay-
ing them royalty—with the alternative of being ruined by
a law-suit in which the wealthy litigant has countless ad-
vantages on his side. Then, if a number of struggling
victims should combine against it—a rare chance —the
syndicate knows it can withdraw without loss.
A solution might be found in a very-well-drafted
Act of Parliament, or—perhaps even better —it might be
found in the judgment of every case on its merits. This
is an idea of Norman Selfe, the well-known Sydney en-
gineer and patent expert. It seems to be conceded that
the present Bill is intended to benefit the Ashcroft syndi-
cate. That syndicate has plenty of money : it should not
cost much to pass a special Bill through N.S.W. Parlia-
ment setting out exactly what Ashcroft wants. The prin-
ciple that patent rights belong to the inventors is recog-
nised by N.S.W. : Parliament should be only too pleased
bo enforce that law by removing Ashcroft’s disabilities,
if he can make out a good enough case. But, at pre-
sent, Parliament is asked to go it blind, and trust—the
Minister of Justice? The Bulletin believes the present
Minister to be perfectly upright, but it refuses to place
any public official in a position where he may be called on
any day to refuse a bribe of £25,000, offered by a wealthy
syndicate with patent rights worth millions. For this is
a damning blot on the Bill—the final decision in these
ticklish matters rests not with the Supreme Court of per-
manent judges sitting in public, but with an accidental
politician sitting in private, exposed to every wind of
influence. Says sec. 9 : “ Leave to amend (the Minister’s
leave to amend) shall be conclusive as to the right of the
party to make the amendment allowed except in case of
fraud (how are you going to prove fraud ?); and the
amendment shall in all Courts and for all purposes be
deemed to form part of the specification.”
And, in order to give a Minister of Justice every
ohance, “no amendment shall be allowed that would
. . . claim an invention . . . substantially larger than or
substantially different from the ” original specification.
Who decides what “substantially” means? The Minister
for Justice, whose leave to amend is “ conclusive in all
courts and for all purposes." It isn’t good enough—not
for The Bulletin, anyway.

In the matter of Widow Kilpatrick and Hud-
dart, Parker and Co. (elsewhere dealt with) there are now
two appeals pending to the Privy Council on behalf of
Huddart, Parker—one against decision of Vic. Full Court
of five Judges refusing them a third new trial; the other
against the recent decision of the Full Court allowing the
widow’s appeal against Justice Hodges’ severe terms as to
costs. H.P. and Co. wished to consolidate the appeals,
but this was opposed, and refused by Judge Hood. H. P.
and Co. have to give security for the amount of verdict
and also costs of action, and £5OO for cost's of each appeal
—which will mean about £3OOO in all. They are under-
stood to be backed up by the Melb. Steamship Owners
Ass., and it seems a pity that the Seamen’s Union will not
assist the widow, which it declines to do because Kil-
patrick was not a member of any Union. These Privy
Council appeals mean a delay of about 15 months.
The Federal Bank liquidators expect that the

every 20s. of their respective claims against the said bank
at the date of this resolution ’’—which means that a little
item of £15,000 is to be paid by the general taxpayer for
the relief of a private concern, which has already absorbed
the fat of the land, and is still the same gaunt and hungry
failure it could never help being. As the depositors’
paper is selling at 16s. in the £, a protest was raised on
their behalf ; but it was a broken-winded protest, for the

The N.S. W. Treas. is now about to receive locally
applications for funded 3 per cent, stock at par, and he
expects to get plenty money at that figure. A change,
indeed, from the glorious days of false security, only a
year or two ago, in which prudent people who disliked
gambling and high interest put their money on deposit
with building societies at 8 per cent.—the days when
A.J.S. shares could be sold by the drayload at just under
£3O, and when people still retained some measure of con-
fidence in the trust-investments of the family-solicitor
and the Sunday-school official.

The transference of Mr. Carmichael, Block 10’s
chemist and metallurgist, to the B.H. Proprietary is
probably of some importance. Carmichael and Kohler
(the latter the Proprietary’s assistant general manager
and metallurgist) are understood to be associated in a
sulphide process which the big mine feels like taking in
hand. It differs from most others, in that it is a leaching
process. Prof. Schnabel, in his report, said that this
would be the best plan if a sufficiently cheap zinc-solvent
could be found ; but he knew of none. Mr. Carmichael
claims to have found one. Deprived, of their zinc the
sulphide ores are fairly tractable, though, of course, they
still contain too much silica to constitute an ideal smelting
mixture. The new process is not a positively cheap one,
shareholders will regret to learn; it is only rendered
cheap by the fact that if it does what is claimed for it, it
will save 50 per cent, or so more in value of the contained
metals than the processes now in use do. The zinc is
saved as well as the other metals—in the form of an oxide.
The possibility of doing something more than
has hitherto been possible in this matter of leaching out
the zinc from the sulphides has been largely added to by
the recent development of crushing machinery. So far
(and referring to common conditions, of course), the
stamper battery has more than held its own against all
rivals, despite the great waste of energy involved in the
battery. To the average mill designed to supplant the
battery, the invariable objection has been that the wear
and tear, along with the “flouring” of the metal,” both
due to the grinding action, are altogether excessive. The
Juggernaut mill, which is now beinggotinto operation by
the Banfield process people at Broken Hill, overcomes
this wear and tear and this “ flouring- ” in a great measure.
The machine, which consists of a series of eight bevelled
wheels revolving upon a fixed bottom, and driven in part
from the periphery, is undoubtedly capable of very fine
crushing. It is the exceedingly intimate mechanical
association of the zinc with the other metals that has
caused the trouble with the Broken Hill sulphides; and
this fine crushing, especially when it is not .accompanied
by flouring, will, at any rate, remove one high obstacle.
It is possible, however, that some smelters may object to
the ore coming to them in the shape of impalpable powder;
but, so far, the finely-crushed stuff that has been sent
away from Broken Hill has found a ready sale.
There is a pretty wide and deep gulf fixed
between the silver party in the States which Bryan leads
and the bimetallist party—if it is a party—in Australia
and Europe. In Australia especially and in England to
some extent it is “ the silver question.” Bryan’s party
say it isn’t the silver question at all, and add that they
wouldn’t go across the Street merely to save the silver-
producers. They don’t particularly want to see silver
worth more than 2s. 6d. an ounce —certainly don’t want
to see it more than that unless wheat and cotton and
other commodities are also advanced. They have laid so
much stress upon this conjunction of the price of silver
and the price of other things which Labor produces that
bimetallism there has become a Labor question.
In Australia and Europe, on the contrary, it is
mostly a capitalists’ question. Except, perhaps, in Lan-
cashire, where, on account of the languishing cotton
industry, the same conjunction has been always insisted
upon; but an attempt to organise on the same lines
among the wheat farmers of northern South Australia
was damned by the names of the merchant men who
bossed the movement. Meantime the European silver-
man, who see no hope except in international bimetallism,
denounces as openly as he dares the Bryan silver party as
putting back the movement 20 years, chiefly on the
ground that the more silver there is produced and stored
up (and, of course, the Bryan party proposals will give a
fillip to silver production) the more difficulty there will be
in handling it when the time comes to agree upon a,
“ ratio of value” between the white metal and gold. So
the Australian and European silver-man won’t be happy
whichever party “ gets there.”

Sydney D.T.’s recent article to prove that there
is a boom in the building trades round Sydney was a
source of amusement to local architects with whom busi-
ness has never been so dull as at present; and, as any re-
covery in the building trade always makes itself apparent
to the architects months beforehand, the alleged boom is
still too far ahead to be discerned. And on the day the
D.T. article was printed over 200 odd artisans (S.M.
Herald said the very best artisans) left for S. Africa, and
the exodus continues daily Westralia-wards. Still the
D.T. avers that there is a building-boom, and Premier
Reid says that N.S.VV. is getting jolly and fat.

Premier mine, W.A., has had one more crushing,
anyhow : 140 tons, 1720 z. A drop in tonnage and value.

Chief Inspector Slee has written the usual re-
port on the Overflow mines, N.S.W. : “The whole
country has a mineralised appearance and deserves more
extensive development and to be more thoroughly pro-
spected.” The monotony of Slee’s reports is simply
killing.

Stated that the dispute in reference to Barrass
and Conley’s mine at Cobar has been settled through the
good influences of Col. Waddell; also that W. P. Manning
has visited the district, speaks in the highest terms of the
mineral resources of the district, and thinks Barrass and
Conley’s mine will be one of the greatest of N.S.W. gold-
producers. Which sounds like a prospectus.
* * * *
“ Pending the sale of the mine in London, the
Big Hill has closed down under three months’ exemption.”
The market has also closed down to a humble bob a share,
so the faith in the mine, the London market, or some-
thing, is not too great. The Sabbath tipster attributes
the fall of this alleged N.S.W. mine to the depression in
Westralia. The writer is sorry to attribute it to the
Sabbath tipster. For persistent bad luck, Jonah is not in
the same street with him.

Sydney D.T.’s mining-man, who has just ex-
amined the Orara goldfield, gives the pride of place to
Mr. Alfred Cadell’s Corauiba King, which strikes him as
being “the ‘mother vein’ of the district. It has been
traced through the proprietary’s leaseholds for fully* a
quarter of a mile, and has been opened up in several
places. Its width runs Up to,lift., and there are shopts
hundreds of feet in length which will average 4ft. to sft.
in width. Bulk samples show that throughout it is of
highly payable quality. The gold occurs principally in a
fine slate in combination with arsenical pyrites ; in fact,
the association of-the metal and mineral is so close as to
appear to be almost a chemical combination.’’ This fits in
with what The Bulletin has learnt from other reliable
quarters. The Coramba King, this paper hears, only cost
the present holder some 190 )0, whereas over ,£40,000 was
paid for Taylor s Reward, which has a lot of gold in sight
and is a sensational surface show in much " disturbed ”
country, with its permanency yet to be tested.

Amongst the cabled registrations of mines in
London are the Tomingley G.M. Co. in Peak Hill district,
N.S.YV., and the Lady Hampden Consolidated - capital
only £250,000. Where this is Heaven knows. The
Golden Link at Kalgoorlie has been formed with a capital
of £550,000. It would only take a few tons of gold a year
to pay dividends!
*** * .
When the Argus special’s first two articles ap-
peared describing the three or four big mines of Kalgoor-
lie the boomsters, boodlers and brokers threw up their
hats in delight. Since he has shown up the awful propor-
tion of “ cats ” in the. country their conduct is much more
subdued. He thus summarises the mines within a radius
of three miles of Ooolgardie : “ In fulfilling my mission to
review without bias the position of mining in Ooolgardie
to-day the task has been far from a pleasant one. The
plain, bald truth, which affects the pockets of a good
many people, is often not pleasant reading matter to
interested parties, and neither is it cheerful work for the
writer. When you go below in mines day after day which
are stated to present real good ‘ shows,’ and you can dis-
cover nothing but purely prospecting ventures or rank
duffers, you are apt to fancy that you are becoming a
pessimist, or that you are losing your faith in human
nature. It takes a good deal to teach foolish people,
who will dabble in mining scrip, that mining is
one thing and prospecting is another. Such in-
dividuals generally consider that a mine and a
prospecting show are one and the same thing,’
and they draw ridiculous conclusions and comparisons,
to console themselves as they drop their money down
shafts or into the pockets of ‘ first robbers.’ Without fear
of contradiction, it can be safely asserted that no goldfield
has ever had such chances and opportunities as Ooolgardie..
More money has been freely found to work thisfield than
any other part of Australasia, and the wonder is that the
enormous amount of blind and reckless work has not
developed more payable or promising lodes. The place
has had a fair trial, and it has now proved itself to be a
very third-rate goldfield, with the exception of a few good
shoots of ore here and there. However, some people
prefer to live in a fool’s paradise, and there is no doubt
that a day of reckoning is not far off.” Which is just
what The Bulletin has been saying steadily for a long,
long while, amid the scorn and derision of the crowd who
wanted to hear quite another song.
* * * *
“ The Lake View mine is pumping from 8000 to
10,000 gallons of water from the Morning Star, and water
from the Golden Treasure will be conducted to the mine
by pipes shortly. Kalgoorlie will probably be better
supplied with water this summer than any previous
summer.” Which is saying little. Where is the magni-
ficent expanse of water of Hannan’s lake ? Chief Wes-
tralian products : gold and water lies.

Cosgrove’s mine, Ooolgardie, is now described
as “ continuing to drag on its disappointing career. The
eastern lode is now abandoned, and prospects are any-
thing but cheering.” A 10-head battery and plenty of
water —but no gold !
* * * •
The quantity of ore in sight in Bayley’s is esti-
mated at 20,000 tons, which Daly, of the Argus, thinks
within the mark. Valued at 6dwt., and, as more rich
patches may be confidently looked for, it has been
declared that the value can be safely estimated at 12 to
13dwt. But the Argus special wants to know why the
value is based on assays. With an idle 20-head battery
and thousands of tons of ore at grass, why not adopt the
more practical method ? Assays are for asses.

Burbank’s Central G.M. Co. is on the market
in W.A. Capital, £30,000 in 60,000 shares of 10s. each.
Directors, Alick Forrest, Venn, and Rhys-Jones, editor
Mining Journal ! Much stress is laid on the very fine
crushings from the Burbank’s Birthday Gift mine—the
Central has apparently had none of its own—and some
wonderful assays are given. How long is the public
ignorance to be traded on by assays? Prospectus says :
“ The property adjoins the celebrated Burbank’s Birthday
Gift,” and J. T. C. Saunders, M.E., reports, “Adjoins the
Burbank’s Birthday Gift property on the South-West, and
distant about 15 chains from the above property.” It is
only in Westralia that a mine can adjoin another and still
be 15 chains away.

The Calumet and Hecla, which Is one'of the
four great copper-mines of the world, recently sold as
scrap-iron 20,000 tons of worn-out and cast-off machinery,
which at one time and another represented an expendi-
ture of upwards of a million of money. This mine
employs 3456 men, and has paid in divs. nearly ten
millions. ...
The new Red Jacket shaft of the Calumet and
Hecla is the deepest and has the most powerful
hoisting machinery in the world. This shaft is 15J4.
x 25ft., inside diameter, contains six compartments,
and is 4900 ft. deep. A crosscut of 1800 ft. from the bottom
of this shaft to the lode will occupy one year. The
engine-house holds two pair of triple-expansion engines
of 4000 h.p. per pair, having Cylinders 20j£, 31|, and 50in,
in dia. by a 6ft. stroke. They can run 60 revolutions a
minute, and can hoist 10 tons per load at a speed of 60ft.
a sec., just equal to 40 mjles an hour ! The stack is,l2jft.'
in dia. and 250 ft. high. The estimated cost of this
gigantic hoisting plant is ' 400,000, which is far more
than Landy’s Dream Co. paid the lawyers for its serial
tramway.
The Calumet and Hecla pays £5 a year in divs.,
though the balance-sheet does not disclose the amount of
capital invested. It mills 960,000 tons of ore per an.,
yielding 3'31 per cent, of copper at a cost of 275. a ton.
The directors report they have ten years’ stoning at pre-
sent pace. Neither the Kaiser nor the Linda Lyell has
anything like this amount of pa)' dirt exposed—which
seems irrelevant. The rock temperature in the Calumet
and Hecla at 4900 ft. is 87’6deg.—a heat which does not
interfere with active mining operations. Nobody knows,
but it is suspected the miners work in silk tennis jackets.

Send as much gold as you like to an Australian
mint and you can demand to be paid back in gold coins ;
to the English mint ditto. But if you send gold to the
French mint, you may have to take half back in silver;
and if to Germany or other European mints, a portion in
silver and in some cases in paper.

Sydney possesses one company of money-lenders
whose zeal for percentages should bring it early fame.
The capital is £2O, when all paid up, and only the poorest
persons in temporary need of 10s. or £1 are accommo-

is paid weekly, and the principal is at early call, the
calculation of per cent, per annum runs into figures.

Who is to succeed Judge Innes on N.S. W.
Supreme Court Bench? His 15 years (pension

both of them are going to Europe again soon.
That leaves Want, Rogers, and Barton as the only

Rogers chances of promotion. Want will not

The now famous Adelaide Hospital dissen-

now, after two years, not one of the original resi-

Nearly every doctor has been publicly charged
with manslaughter at different times, and one

Hobart and Launceston each boast about
500 persons on the permanent roll of the Benevo-

like institutions threaten to collapse for want of
funds. Blind and deaf and dumb folks are ex-

agitation is raised by a local D. & D. & B. Insti-
tution, but philanthropists are few in Tasmania
and water-carriage is cheap. Federation in afflic-
tion !

The “ rule-of-thumb ” of Sydney Benevo-
lent Society is supposed to be that, for every two
foundlings baptised as Protestants, one is to be
baptised as a R.C. The choice is supposed to go
“by fluke.” Card. Moran, however, objects that
this agreed-upon happy-go-luckiness is not ob-
served ; from which objection it would seem that
Protestantism grabs more than its share of bap-
tisms. “What is your name?” “John Door-
step.” “Who gave you that name?” “The
Benevolent Asylum, wherein I was made a heretic
Protestant with power to ate bafe on a Friday.”

would kill his wife and children and harm himself.

management of tyranny and undue cheese-paring,
and the charitable movement now on hand is
likely to be prejudiced by the ill-feeling which
has survived the breaking down of these charges.

The cause of the trouble alluded to has up to now
never been fully explained in print. “Love is
blind,” and when the Rev. Moss was in charge
of the place, there were a number of blind old
men on the premises of whose being Cupid had,
in some cases, taken entire possession. Through
them, it appeared, he shot bolts not only at
susceptible women outside the gates, but at boys
within the precincts, until, it is said, life within
the institution bore a feeble comparison to exist-
ence, in Lot’s day, in the cities of the plain. Some
of the male inmates also formed the habit of
breaking bounds at night and coming home not
too sober or not coming home at all. Mr. Moss
(since dead) knew nothing of this ; the fact that he

what was going on, straightway purged the instn

there arose a howl against his reforms, and he was
unable to defend them as he might have done for
fear of injuring the charity by publishing the

Surgeon Fitzgerald, of Melbourne, speaks
emphatically on the subject of female cycling.
He says that in another three years there will be
more disease among biking women than surgeons
will be able to attend to. Which suggests a good
time coming for lady doctors, presuming that girls
who have cultivated a taste for the machine will
care to get treated by one of their own sex. If
there is only a measure of truth in alarmist
theories, the bike being destructive to modesty,
is the lady-doctor s latest foe, and a more deadly
one than even the steam roundabout.

Writes a Melb. man from Gore, M.L. :
“Wind!!! In Melbourne you only hear it sighing
and soughing. Here it shrieks like a prohibited
prostitute yelling for gin. I saw a case of oranges
blown clean across the street to-day.”
That most marked post-mortem symptom
of death from snake-venom, viz, rapid discoloration
and decomposition, has just been found to be due
to the fact that, whereas normal blood has the
power of destroying bacteria placed in it, the blood
of snake-bitten animals has not. Now, the white
corpuscles are the Danites of the blood, and several
Australian experimenters have noticed venom to
have a disorganising effect on the white corpuscles.
Therefore, the rapid decomposition is due, not to
a chemical action set up by the venom, but to the
venom disabling the defending white corpuscles,
and thus enabling the bacilli of putrefaction to
work their will unchecked.

The Wesleyan churches of
Melbourne have expressed their
“seriousdissatisfaction ” (every-
thing Wesleyan is serious, by
the way) with the Vic. Govern-
ment for permitting art unions
to be continued, under certain
conditions, by certain friendly
societies. Practically this is an
outbreak of sectarian horror at
the discovery that the local
Hibernian Society is ad vertising
an art union in the interests,
more or less, of R.G. charities.
Every true disciple of John
Wesley could find a serious
delight in seeing every object
of Holy Roman charity die
from starvation.

Prahran (Melb.) Presby-
terian Church proposes to make
women eligible for election as
elders, deaconesses, and general
business managers of the taber-
nacle. This may appear like a
new idea in Presbyterian circles,
but it is quite familiar to the
Nonconformist Conscience.
Elderly females have controlled
chapel politics ever since the
days of Wesley, and Rev.
Obadiah has mostly retaliated
by controlling their daughters
on the strict Q.T. __ It is only
the Pope’s shepherds that can
manage to run a religion whilst
bossing everybody connected
with it.
“ The Rev. Ross is sedulously attentive to
the Dederers” (the Tam worth condemned), says
the local paper, “and prays to God daily on their
behalf.” “We ask God to save those whom we
decline to save,” said one Frenchman. “We ask
God to pardon those whom we won’t pardon,”
said another.

Ludwig Brack lets fall a sinister hint in
discussing the alleged sweating of doctors by
friendly societies :
There is one important feature in connection with the
accouchements in lodge-members’ families which should
not be lost sight of. Doctors with an extensive lodge
practice are often compelled, from want of time, to use
ihe forceps to hasten the event, instead of awaiting the
natural course ; and this may frequently be the origin of
diseases peculiar to women.
If true, and Mr. Brack speaks with authority,
this cuts both ways. When such results may
follow haste, the doctors should surely have back-
bone enough to resist the lodges’ pressure.
The Sydney daily press allows its devotion
to Govt. House to absurdly interfere with its duty
of catering for the public—as witness the Norton
prosecution for alleged sedition, details of which
everybody wanted to see. The reports of this
interesting case were most skimpy. A decent
account of the trial, and especially a full report of
defendant’s speech, would have sold like hot cakes.
The next new Sydney daily, if the man finding
the money knows his business, will be called the
Australian Republic, and will act accordingly.

At Balmain, Sydney, the friendly societies
have been in the habit of annually holding a Sun-
day parade for the benefit of the local hospital,
but this is frowned down by the bulk of the local
clergy, who apparently consider that Sunday was
made not for the worship of God by deeds of
charity-, but simply for the benefit of the parsons
aforesaid. The outcome is two separate move-
ments in aid of the hospital—one, a week-day
affair, by the clergy, the other by the friendly
societies as before. Thus the hospital benefits
twice over.

The Hebrews of Sydney will soon be
treated to a Jewish melody and sacred hymn
exposition, to be held at the Centenary Hall, in
aid of the self-denial fund for the synagogue and
Montefiore Home. The exclusiveness which used
to characterise Hebrew singing will now be broken
down : the synagogue will thus not be the only
locale where Jews will have exercised themselves
in hyinnody. The conservative element of the
congregation is said to view the movement with
disfavor. L
Miss Youngfcooth, a hopeless old maid,
owns most of the land around Bollywollygoo. She
called the other day on one of her tenants, Mick
Hooley, who owed her £ 10, and stated that she
was going to Melbourne for a long holiday, and
he had better give her his bill for three months for
what was due. Mick didn’t know the difference
between a pro.-note and a cow-bail, so he looked
at her in amazement for a minute and then
shouted out to his wife: “Hell to your sowl,
Bridge, but this old scarecrow wants to seduce
our Will-i-am (a hardfaced, long-legged lad of 20)
away to Melbourne instead of taking the dirthy
money we owe her.” Then that maiden lady was
carried home on a stretcher.

In Vic. Parliament the stupid statement of
M'Lellan, M.L.A., that there were 30,000 prosti-
tutes in the province, was repeated by Opposition-
leader MTntyre. Latest statistics put the number
down as under 2000. Probably 5000 might be
nearer the truth, but 30,000 is obviously an out-
rageous estimate.

The ridiculous point about the journalistic
outcry against public servants doing press- work is
that, while journalists complain that certain Ser-
vice scribblers under-cut professionals, Vic. Go-
vernment has ruled that State servants can do as
much writing as they like so long as they take no
money for it. This leaves the subsidised serawler,
who can afford to do sports, theatres, races, con-
certs, &c., for free tickets of admission, exactly
where he was before.

- Spagnoletti : “ Bishop Goe whines again,

writer emphasises Pastor Torrance s idea : all re-
venues to be pooled, and equitably dealt out. The

The guileful nurse in her drabs and her
grays is hardly less dangerous than the governess.
A few years ago, in the backblocks of Maoriland,
there was a happy family, consisting of the old
man, five sons, and a widowed daughter with
sundry children. Four nice-looking governesses
came to reside there inside three years, and each
of them got married to one of the sons. There
were no other girls within several miles, so there
was practically nothing else for a son to do save
marry the governess. The fifth time the old man
insisted on the ugliest governess procurable, so a
lumpy German with green spectacles was pro-
cured, and the only remaining son promptly mar-
ried her. Then the old man took to drink, and is
rapidly swilling away the station and its contents,
and three of the sons are drinking also, and that
happy family is broken up.

Very wisely, and after the manner of the
children of unrighteousness, the Anglican Synod
(at the instance of a befooled Australian bishop)
is fixing up a synodical law, by which a bishop-
nominate shall know exactly what his prospective
see is worth in cold annual cash before he accepts
the bishopric. Logical. If ecclesiasticism is a.
“ livelihood,” let it be a livelihood. Abolish the
cant of “ a call from the Lord,” and say at once
“ Any advance on my present salary ? ” What a
sweet world this would be if lying were impossible !
We’d be killing each other openly instead of
cheating each other secretly. The ecclesiastical
wolves would shed their sheepskins, and the Red
Riding Hoods would never mistake their grand-
mothers.

The case of a South Melbourne widower is
full of solemn warning. He was middle-aged, and
he married a young girl on the understanding that
she would renounce her bike in his favor. But
immediately after marriage she refused to “bury
her life with him and his two children,” and re-
sumed her wild career on the more fascinating
machine. When a woman gets attached to a bike

LADY ( engaging new housemaid): "Gwendolen!
That is much too romantic a name, with

LADY: “ What is your surname?”
APPLICANT : “ Buckie! ”
(or a Chinaman) there’s no weaning her away.
She simply can’t reform.

easily distinguished from paste,” says Dr. Mulhol-

the stone, whether in its setting or not, be examined
under a dark cloth, through which the Rontgen rays are
passing, it glows brilliantly if a diamond, but not so if
paste or glass. If the stone be examined on a fluorescent
screen it appears perfectly transparent if a genuine dia-
mond, and opaque if not.” An interesting question to

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Cot. 20, 1896.
Mt Dear Myee—
Coming after Mrs. Ponderbury and Co’s pretty
£owns, a “ Pair of Spectacles ” at Sydney Criterion!
is a sartorial slump. Mrs. Brough, as the lady
holding the world’s record for omitting to flirt;
with a (presumably) good-looking curate when she:
had the chance, wears appropriately smart but un~
frivolous frocks. Lily Titheradge is ingenuous ini
white. The tailoristic triumphs of the piece fall!
te Harry Hill, who sports a “ real elegant ” tani
vest and pants of celestial blue. In the curtain-
raiser, his gorgeousness as Sir Guy de Mountfort,
made an animated first-night d. c. positively
gasp. He celebrates his first costume part by-
coming out in a gallant-of-England suit—bright,
orange silk, love-locks and all. Emma Temple-
costumes the innkeeper’s wife in a gown to be re-
membered usefully as a practicable fancy ball rig-
out, and Miss Hardy wears a baby frock of grey,,
and a yellow wig.
“An American Citizen ” made his first appear-
ance before a full house at the Lyceum. It is re-
freshing that all those pretty gowns are not to be-
displayed merely to the yellow-plush chair-backs,
in the d.c. The jaundiced color has been muchi
too prominent, but for this last of the Nat Good-
win plays the public is crowding in by tens and
twenties. The upholstering of the citizenesses on
the stage is an attraction. The battle of flowers,
at Nice in the second act brings out Miss Estelle-
Mortimer—as usual, everybody’s aunt —in a white-
satin fete dress with yellow trimmings everywhere
and'too much of ’em, after the style of globe-trotting-
’Murkan women ; Gertrude Elliott and Ethel
Browning, as her two nieces, wear also clothes of
Rue-de-la-Paix cut. The first has an overdress of
the very newest fabric, white grass-lawn over green,
silk, the skirt much adorned with lace and long;
green chiffon sash ends —another up-to-date fancy.
Miss Emelie Melville, as the youthful Lady Bunn,
is prettily bound in pale-blue cloth. Maxine is;
the heroine engaged to the reverend Brown, who-
has a tiresome habit of dying about the world in.
different times and places and coming to life again.
She wears three dresses and a whole stock-in-
trade of cloaks, and her dresser must have a busy
time of it behind the scenes. Once she is so-
hurried that her ball-dress has to be laced up-
before the audience ; as a garment it does not live
up to the gorgeous cloak of yellow satin veiled
with lace and much fuss and feathers about the
neck. Her Nice costume, which gets a pelting of'
flowers and extra-large-sized confetti, is pink silk:
veiled with the übiquitous grass lawn (I am quite-
tired of writing that word). The parasols, I ob-
serve with admiration, are all “ tulips.”
A conversazione happened last Thursday even-
ing at the Art Society’s exhibition now showing
in Pitt-street. The soiree included music, recita-
tions, and the usual adjuncts, and there were
three very crowded roomfuls of guests, to whom
as they entered the hosts bobbed a solemn greet-
ing from the stairhead. Artists Percy Spence,.
Collingridge, and Coffey contributed lightning
sketches, which a panting multitude in the back-
ground took for granted. The dressing was weird
and wonderful—it always is at an artistic show.
To be a living gospel of the Beautiful, an artist’s
womankind think it the one thing needful to en-
large their waist-line and pin a wisp of towzled
lace around their necks. There was one girl with
a handful of shivery grass rakishly pinned near
her knob ; where it withered she had straws in
her hair. Two or three of the women looked as if
they had been struck by a southerly buster in
early life and had never got their clothes tidy
since. This is supposed to be Sassiety’s society,
but sassiety didn’t turn out in any force to the
conversazione.
Much sentiment was given away gratis with the
gilt-edged invitation cards for Rosehill race meet-
ing on Saturday afternoon. The secretary—which
his name is O’Mara —made an impassioned appeal
to the “ sterner sex ” to come out and admire his
well-kept lawn and flower-beds, artfully issuing
with the prospectus two ladies’ tickets—a delicate
way of insinuating the best method of popularising
any meeting. It took a long time to get to Rosehill.
The first train broke down, and this seemed to
discourage the others, for they started unostenta-
tiously from a remote platform unknown to Red-
fern porters. The last special behaved most
capriciously, darting past stations wilfully, and
then coquettishly drawing up nowhere in particu-
lar ; it at last grew weary and slowed down and
finally crawled into the racecourse station utterly
fatigued. The public did not respond in vast
hordes to the pretty pink circulars, and the two
eagles in the cage looked lonesome for want of
company. But there was a fair attendance on the
stand. A woman with a crepon plissi dress and
lace-edged parasol all white looked nice, and there
were some muslins with smart fixings.
A piano-recital “ by ladies only ” —assisted by a
man or two—was held on Friday in the Y.M.C.A.
Hall. Misses May Mitchell, Sarade and Conway
are pupils of Kowalski, who kindly came by ex-
press from Melb. to see them through their
trouble. All the music was strictly classical and
seemed very hard. It is inadequate to talk of
“playing” such. Half-an-hour’s hard-graft at a
Beethoven Sonata caused a short-sighted old
gentleman near me to become quite restive and
peer wistfully at the association badge displayed
on high, thinking it was a clock.
A newly-finished bridal outfit running into four
figures forme d the staple of a mild orgie at a
fashionable drapery one day last week. Adoring
feminine friends were invited by the bride-elect
to take lea and ices in a private room driving the
delirious joys of gazing at the garments and making
envious disparagements in an undertone. The
clothes in question are distinctly choice and are
designed for foreign wear—it is a pity that the
destiny of the cobwebby lace and muslin is to be
thumped to pieces by coolie washerwomen.
A fashionable military wedding attracted an
excited throng of spectators to St. Andrew’s
Presbyterian Church on Wednesday, when Capt
J. Cordon Legge and Miss A. F. Ferguson, of
Bondi, were made legally one. The church was
decorated with elaborate floral designs in the cus-
tomary funereal white, but the colorlessness of the
ordinary ordeal was relieved in this instance by the
uniforms of the 2nd Infantry, to which both groom
and best man belong. Capt. Legge, one of a
family of tall and handsome brothers, gave an
unfamiliar prominence to the usually minor r6le
of bridegroom, and his second played the part of
best man with quiet force. The sacrificial robe of
the bride was adorned with diamonds and flowers,
and she had two bridesmaids. An avenue of steel',
formed by the swords of a guard of honor over the
heads of the licensed-to-be-happy couple as they
walked to their carriage, had a glittering effect.
An astonishing number of gifts were afterwards
inspected by the guests at Needs’ rooms, where
the wedding-feast was held.
A Quaker wedding is about as sensible an
arrangement as they make them. When Thomas
Wardell, of Maoriland, was married to Ellen
'Susannah Neave at the Devonshire-street meeting-
house, the other day, the ceremony was chiefly
performed in brilliant flashes of silence, barring a
short address from the bride’s father on the duties
of wife and husband towards each other. Then
the bride and bridegroom took hands and in a
straightforward, honest way gave their word of
honor to stick to each other through thick and
thm. Afterwards the legal business was all fixed
up by the Registrar, and the whole thing was just
as binding as the “ as-long-as-ye-both-shall-live ”
curse hurled at them from behind altar-rails, with
the voice that breathed o’er Eden ” lifting the
roof off, and six bridesmaids weeping in the
chancel.
A toney household is just now filled with
mourning and lamentation because of a disas-
trous mistake in _ certain wedding portraits
published in a “ society ” paper, labelled to be the
phiz of a recently-wedded daughter of the house
and her bridegroom. Whereas the photos unac-
countably got mixed, and the wrong]y-labelled
pair are in reality the countenances of a couple
not warranted to be within coo-ee of the Nicest,
j- he irate mother has had to make frantic appeals
to stop the next issue of the paper, lest the high-
toned reproductions of her daughter and son-in-
law shall also go forth to the world with the wrong
brand affixed.
The death of poor Annie Taylor—of whom a
portrait is printed in this issue—was due to failure
of the. heart s action. She had been ailing for
some time, and, during the last year, her illness
had aged her considerably. The Bland Holt co.
•of which her. husband, Mr. E. C. Corlesse, is a
member, sent some beautiful wreaths and crosses
for the funeral at Waverley. Annie Taylor, as
an actress, had an abiding charm in her expressive
voice, which abounded in rich, humorous tones.
When (for one instance of hundreds which could
be quoted), as Mrs. Gilfillian, in “Sweet Laven-
der, she used to ask at the door of Clement Hall’s
•chambers, Is Minnie here ? ” those three words
never failed to raise a laugh, spoken, as they were
with all the shocked propriety, of the British
matron.
Mrs. Carl Fischer’s death was also due to heart-
failure, brought on by overwork. So much had
her writing affected her nerves that in her last
days she was constantly handing her daughter
imaginary copy to overlook. She had a forty-
woman power of working—the Herald social
column, dramatic and musical notices in the Mail,
and answers to correspondents in the latter paper
were among her weekly tasks. Besides, she was
interested in many charities, and had collected
vast mounds of material for writing a history of
music _in Australia. Her newspaper work will
most likely be divided up amongst two or three.
I am told that the most swagger club dinner-
parties must consist now-a-days of a dozen men at
a square table three a-side. At a club in mar-
vellous Melbourne a “ dozen ” dinner was lately
given to celebrate the arrival of a new chef
secured by cable from Calcutta. The treasure
worked well, and produced many surprises which
the diners pronounced to be masterpieces, so the
man from the East continues to enrich the daily
menu at that club.
They are having it hot at Kalgoorlie. A friend
writes me : “Old Sol has been giving us beans—
-10- in the shade already—only there is no shade in
Kalgoorlie. And willy-willies ! One, the other
day, ‘ kinked ’ the Presbyterian church in two,
blew up corrugated iron verandahs like match-
wood, and sent tents up to find the North Pole
per balloon. The dust lies inches thick on every-
thing. A * toff ’ here is a man who brushes his
clothes daily.”
Also : “ The W. A. fields carry a mongrel popu-
lation. A group of neighbors confabbing together
in Hannan-street included two Greeks, a Sicilian,
a Sardinian, an Irishman from Tipperary, a
Russian, a Lancashire lad, and a Vic. native.
English is a wonderfully elastic tongue ; they
were all intelligible to one another in that lan-
guage, more or less broken. The worst of all was
the Irishman.”
There is trouble in a coastal congregation just
now, owing to the devotion of the minister of the
flock to popular science. During one of his kodak-
accompanied strolls, when he was communing
with Nature and keeping an eye upon the surf-
bathers, he obtained a splendid snap-shot of two
of them. Later on his two leading deacons turned
up at his invitation at the parsonage to learn all
fhpv fc wf t? r pho . to i rapby Wlth experiments. As
they were interestedly watching the progress of
the last clerical snap-shot in the batCto their
surprise they beheld the forms of their own wives

The white-slavery murmur is heard again spas-
modically, as it generally is when somebody wants
to whet his little axe and set the same old grind-
stone whirring. The weak point of the shirt is
that it is never heard save as a political cry : the
poor victim of sweating who toils early and late
to make s|d. a day and pays for cotton out of that,
or Is. 4yd. for three pairs of trousers, is a mere
figure of straw set up and knocked down again at
the pleasure of her political exploiter. But the
sweating goes on briskly all the time and will con-
tinue to go on while bargain-hunting women in-
on low-water-mark prices for slop-made cloth-
ing. These are the real oppressors of the poor
sempstress, taking starvation pay in dread of
being undersold by the alien worker who can live
on a handful of rice a day and sleep with his head
hanging over a barrow.

n ocean liner well-known in Australian waters,
although it has not called at this port for some

its own. This state-room is always kept locked,
and no passenger is allowed to take it, no matter
how crowded the berths are. The tradition is that
it is the post-mortem abode of a drowned baby,
thrown out of the port by its six-year-old brother
in a fit of passion at being punished.
Cyclomania is still raging in Vic. Neglected

The enthusiasts must have bicycles, come what
will, and if they haven’t the necessary coin,
advertise articles which they are willing to swap

machines, typewriters, suites of furniture, game-
birds, panoramas, skates, ice-chests, incubators,
gas-fittings, and pictures, are a few of the induce-
ments held out to probable exchangers in the
advertising columns, while an ambitious boy of 15
forged his employer’s name to a cheque in pay-
ment for the much-craved-for bike.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“ At the Women’s Suffrage meeting in Mel-
bourne Town Hall, the other night, the platform
looked as if the community had deliberately contri-
buted for exhibition its oldest and most unattrac-
tive maiden aunts. Good-looking and young women
were described by these people as ‘ the unthinking
ones ’; their absence was thus accounted for.
T. 0. Gray, member for Prahran, ornamented the
rostrum, surely forgetful for the time being that
the enfranchisement of the sex will give votes to
the women he describes as ‘ members’ suburban
wives.’
“ Rumored that a very fashionable dentist will
have to give evidence touching one of the lady
principals in a coming divorce-suit. Which re-
minds one that the possible influence of dental
operations upon the female feelings is not gener-
ally known, or suspected. ‘A man is but a lute
in a woman’s hands, she plays upon him what
tune she will,’says somebody in ‘Yeomen of the
Guard.’ When a woman takes the chair in a tor-
ture chamber there’s a chance for the male lutist
to extract amorous music from her nerve-strings.
lor that matter, chloroform, under any circum-
stances, has much to answer for.
“ Next Saturday afternoon (24th) there is to be a
charity garden-party, open to everybody who can
raise the humble necessary shilling—children’arf-
Srice —at Myoora, Toorak, the residence of Mr.
iobert Harper and his benevolent wife. It is
officially described as the Spinners’ Garden Fete,
in aid of the Childrens’ Hospital and Infant
Asylum, otherwise an al fresco bazaar, or a go-as-
you-please with marquees in it, where one can buy
something for the good cause if so disposed. Lady
Brassey, as a toiler rather than a Spinner, will
open the fete in due form at 3 p.m., and the cur-
tain will, figuratively speaking, fall with the
shades of night at 7 o’clock precisely. The Bul-
letin is asked to assist by spinning a paragraph
of fine, soft quality.
“Politicians with a quiverful of daughters
probably see a bright side to Woman Suffrage,
but, as M.L.A. Harper only possesses one in
short frocks, it is not surprising that he ‘ downed ’
the measure the other night, though he wound
up with many compliments to the sex. Easy
talking for a man whose wife is as charming
as possible, and wonderfully youthful for the
mother of grown-up sons. Mrs. Harper (a
daughter of Dr. Cairns, that handsome
old pioneer of Victorian Presbyterianism, and
pastor of the now defunct Chalmers Church)
married her oatmeal-and-coffee magnate when he
was only ‘ a young man in business,’ much against
the wish of her parents. Her father lived to a
hale old age, and his widow is still to be seen in
Toorak, erect as some gaunt old tree, despite her
years, but of their large family there are few sur-
viving. The old people brought up more than one
family of motherless grandchildren, many of whom
were as short-lived as their parents. The Harpers
themselves lost their eldest daughter, a girl of 15,
some years ago, after a few hours virulent fever,
in Rome.
ia“ ter ,P oor Baron Von Mueller did not
die young mit consumption,’ as he always said lie
would (hence the precautionary woollen comforter),
.but of brain-fag, at the ripe age of 71. No one in
need of help ever left the Baron’s dusty doorstep
empty-handed. He was ‘an orphan himself, and
could feel for others,’ he was wont to explain, as
tearfully as if he were a ‘ mitherless bairn ’ of
seven instead of 70. WTen his pockets were
cleaned out he would give mendicants the contents
of his larder, clothes, ponderous volumes of his
own writings—whatever he could lay hands on.
“The pretty, dolly daughter of a very impor-
tant personage answered ‘No’ to a certain wealthy
military person who was thrown much into her
company when papa was acting-manager of the
social hippodrome. Her maternal relative would
not hear of the match, ’tis said, on the ground
that the suitor was rather too matured for the
young lady. It is true (or it may be) that he had
m the days of yore made an offer to the damsel’s
aunt, but one would have thought that his long
experience in admiring the family ought to
qualify him for the niece rather than otherwise.
His taste seems so very reliable.
“ A young fellow of English aristocratic family
was ‘ on his uppers ’ here, not long back, and 1 saw
him distributing a quack’s handbills. Now he has
made a good marriage, and is as well-groomed a
man as any on the Gollins-street Block.
“In three matrimonial police court-cases in
Melbourne recently, the ladies’ bikes were the
prime factors in breeding domestic disagreements.
“ Melbourne is sitting up and gasping over the
alleged goings-on of a sprightly actress and a noble
lord. There are 17 distiuct versions of the story.
“Perhaps it was an advertising trick. A
flower-fan, handed up to an actress in Melb. the
other night, was sprinkled with cayenne pepper,
which got into her eyes, nose, and mouth, making
her howl in agony. The detectives have been
called in, but all they can find out is that one of
the private boxes was peppered too.”
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.
A 64-year-old man confessed at Newtown
police-court the other day to his 93rd conviction.
He was sent up for six months, and asked to be for-
warded to Parramatta as he knew that all the other
gaols were full; besides, he was well-known to the
Parramatta officials. His request was complied
with.
Baron Yon Mueller’s little block of burial
ground was a free grant from the trustees of St.
Kdda (Melb.) cemetery. Out of respect for the
Baron’s faithful services to botany, they voted
him a grave not many days before his unexpected
illness, whereupon the polite old scientist started
to die m acknowledgement of the graceful com-
pliment.
A Tarnagulla (Yic.) man, in the course of
a conflict with a rival rag-and-bone gatherer
chewed his adversary’s left ear to pulp, and tore a
large piece of it off.” There were three previous
convictions against the cannibal, so the local
bench fined him fifty shillings. After this no
man of means need hesitate about chawing up his
best girl when the spirit moves him.
Rev. Prior Yaughan, brother of Cardinal
Vaughan, who visited N.S.W. the other day on
. Pegging expedition, has died in England of a
diabetic fit. The Prior’s Australian mission was
m nowise smiled upon by the ascetic Cardinal
Moran, and it was much smiled at by the com-
munity in general. The Prior, while here, earned
the reputation of being the most accomplished
trencherman who over ate in public ; even the
sports who dine at “Tatt.’s ’were stricken with
wonder at his unholy appetite.
Cabled that Mr. Ernest Hooley has pur-
chased the business of Bovril, Limited-a com-
pany formed in 1889 to manufacture Johnston’s
Jbluid Beef and Bovril—for £20,000,000. The
figure given is probably an advertising exaggera-
tion. Hooley—how he must curse the memory of
his original plebeian godfather !—is one of the
men who made millions, more or less, by exploit-
ing the Dunlop tyre, and had, at a recent date,
bought over £600,000 worth of English estates.
Hooley, it will be remembered, is the name of the
red-headed shop-walker in “ The Shop Girl ”
played in Australia by last Gaiety Co.
Brooks, J.P., of Fitzroy, lately died,
Turner, J.P., at the ensuing meeting of
Melb. Metropolitan Board of Works, moved that
a letter of condolence be sent to the widow and
family. “This,” said the eloquent Turner, “is
the sixth of our original members for whom
Heaven as sent its messenger. X hope when we
all go our memories will be alike fragrant with
the spices of friendship and true honesty. ” That
the memory of members of the Board should be
fragrant with the spices of friendship is a matter
which the rest of the community should not
begrudge, seeing that as sewage - commissioners
their range of perfumery is somewhat restricted.

One of the sights of Melbourne
is to see Premier Turner and his
wife pacing St. Kilda Esplanade on
Sundays followed by a pug-dog which
was presented to the Premieress by
Gov. Brassey’s daughter, Mrs. Free-
man-Thomas. The gubernatorial pup
is not at all proud, and his habit
of pal’ing-up with promiscuous com-
mon persons leads frequently to the
spectacle of Vic.’s Prime Minister
having to turn back and whistle
vehemently for several minutes
amid the guffaws of a disrespectful

No one will more cordially
welcome back Duncan Gillies than
Cameron, a silent member of Vio.
Assembly. As the gillie is to the
Highland chieftain, so is Cameron
to Duncan. He has for years re-
presented Evelyn, a district isolated
from civilisation to such an extent
by surrounding mountains that his
constituents are kept in that state
of hidebound conservatism necessary
to his well-being as their representa-
tive. It was his habit to get Gillies
on the stump before his constituents,
whilst he sat silent, but beaming-
faced alongside—every line of his
face expressive of “You see this is
Gillies; he’ll do anything for me, so
I’m all right. ” How lie has managed
during Duncan’s absence is probably
due to the electors thinking' that
Victoria, with Gillies at the head,
was still booming along under the
guidance of “ our member,” and as
the Gumbuck bridge was built accord-
ing to promise, there was really very
little to complain about.
One of the oldest doctors of Sydney has,
for 30 or 40 years, done a locally unrivalled

people. The explanation is simple: the old
gentleman has the gift of sleeping at will, in a,ny
position, and snoozes comfortably while being
rolled round in his old-fashioned brougham.

When Ben Gould, who had been Mayor,
M.P., J.P., teetotal magnate, and general
panjandrum on the side of religion in one
of the chief Adelaide suburbs, was sentenced to
four years, the other day, foir embezzlement, Judge
Bundey presided. The Judge was Goulds first
employer, and the tears of the court and the
prisoner were dramatically mingled as the unfor-
tunate man was led away.
Anglican Bishop Green, of
Grafton and Armidale (N.S.W.), and
R.O. Bishop Torreggiani, of the same
district, usually travel second-class
on the railways. The R.O. Bishop,
being member of an Order, has taken
a vow of poverty, and the Anglican
Bishop was proffered a See valued
at <£2ooo a year, which, owing to
fallacious investments, pans out a
miserable £4 a week; so that, for
practical purposes, they row in the
same hard-seated boat.
Gould, sentenced to four years’
hard at Adelaide for embezzlement,
was a local-preacher and, until lately,
a prominent M.P. Since the memor-
able convictions of the historio
Crooks and a certain Y.M.C.A*
secretary, local-preachers have rarely
been trusted with cash in Adelaide.
Gould, however, was so exception-
ally pious that they “chanced him,”
but he, like the others, preferred the
Broad Road and fell gloriously to
the tune of £lOOO odd. Verily, dear
friends, the road to Adelaide Gaol ia
paved with local-preachers.
Cardinal Moran closes a Syd-
ney newspaper controversy with the
0. of E. Bishop of Goulburn (N.S.W.)
with this Parthian Hibemicism :
The more he plunges, the deeper he

would, perhaps, be a somewhat awkward
epitaph for “ William Goulburn.” I have
endeavored to lend him a helping hand;
but, as he appears to resent my friendly
aid, it only remains for me, Mr. Editor,
with your kind permission, to leave him
there.
Fancy Mister James kindly permit-
ting “ William Goulburn ” to be left
“stuck in the mud” by Patrick
Francis Card. !
Rumored that when ex-Judge
Windeyer returns to N.S.W. he will
re-enter Parliament. Whatever Min-
istry be in power must, it is argued,
offer him a seat in the Legislative
Council; but the ex-Judge, it is be-
lieved, will try to find a place in the
Assembly. Where, oh where, is the
constituency which would elect Mount
Rennie Windeyer? If the ex-Judge
stands for the Assembly he will have
at last to face the long-burked indict-
ment ; and there are several keen and forceful
citizens who will rejoice in the opportunity of stat-
ing to his face the unanswerable case for the pro-
secution.

of the soul-stirring stories of “Deeds that
Won the -Empire,” it occurs to me that, in
view of the military ardour created alt
■through the land by your spirited articles,!
the military authorities might still further!
Foster it by giving the public a military
parade at least once a year. /"
in this country there are many
colonials who, if ever they are wanted,
will do further deeds of valour, and hold
the empire that has been so nobly won.—
Yours, &c., A.N.A.

“A detachment of 32 troopers is to be sent from N.S. Wales to England. They will take their own horses, with the idea of selling them at a profit sufficient to partially defray the cost of the expedition. If the training and selling of the troopers' horses should be as satisfactory as is
anticipated, a splendid advertisement will be given this colony, the value of which might run into tens of thousands of D.T.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The S.A. “army” now consists of 251
privates and 132 officers.
Alcohol is banished from the Canadian
Parliament House, Ottawa.
It looks as if G.O.M. Gladstone is anxious
to crown his earthly career by precipitating Ar-
mageddon.
When Pastor Fitchett writes up the
British acquisition of Australia he will entitle it,
“ Feeds that won the Empire.”
Queensland did not grow into its name.
It grabbed it by special Act of Parliament, of
which the roving Herbert claims to have been the
father.
Victoria lias made State-education abso-
lutely free, but she charges postage on newspapers.
N.S.W. charges for education and carries news-
papers free.
The most stubborn obstacle to the forma-
tion of a N.S.W. County Council is said to be the
direct and indirect machinations of council-clerks
who dread the effacement of their positions.
Here is the first of innumerable legislative
attempts to induce people to settle on the land in
N.S.W., and does it not look to-day the straight-
est, most honest, and most statesmanlike of the
uncountable endeavors : “Each person volunteer-
ing to go on the land to have 60 acres. Half-an-
acre to be cleared beforehand and huts built.
Each settler to be maintained eighteen months
from the public stores ; clothing, necessary grain,
tools, implements of husbandry to be given, with
such poultry and eggs as the central settlement
can afford.” This was one of Gov. Phillip’s
edicts ; but even these inducements failed in their
effect.
A FACT. AT CUE, W.A.
MINE MANAGER FROM 'OME: “ Ha! have you got any — ah! —'thing-a -
me-bobs’ —ah! —for borwing holes? ”
IRONMONGER: “ Augers, sir?”
M.M.F.O.: “ No—ah! — those ‘ thing-a-me-bobs’ — ah!—for borwing holes
in stone? ”
I.: “ Drills, sir? ”
M.M.F.O.: “ A-ah! y-ass .”
The scientific aspect of N.S.W. Opposition
leader Lyne’s proclaimed refusal to be “ drawn ”
presents itself thus : In a highly-disciplined party
or in a.party which implicitly follows an ad-
mittedly-supreme leader, reticence, even mystery,
on the part of that leader as to policy has a com-
pacting force. Where, however, there is not this
discipline or supremacy of leadership, reticence is
as disintegrating and solvent as diffidence, and is
otherwise suicidal, inasmuch as during the “ un-
drawn ” epoch various members of the party will
have purposely or accidentally publicly expressed
opinions from which they cannot afterwards get
away.
Five members of the present N.S.W.
Government have applied for and obtained rail-
way-passes for life. Three others, who one time
or another acted for the Government in the Upper
House, have also obtained life passes. Some day
a Premier will arise who will wipe such unearned
privileges off the slate of the Constitution.
The committee appointed to take evidence
and report on the Great Western Railway Bill
proposals, now before Tas. Parliament, has favor-
ably recommended that a concession of 640,000
acres of land be granted to the syndicate proposing
to build the rail way. The concession only amounts
to about one-thirtieth of the whole country !
One of N.S.W. Premier Reid’s strongest
tactical points is knowing when to adjourn a de-
bate under a promise to consider whether certain
objections can’t be met by modifications. You
don’t often see Reid arching his spine (the convex
is the other side) and spitting tomcatlike defiance
at the bullpups of the House. He parleys, ad-
journs, and afterwards lubricates the machinery
by “ shouting ” something else politically desired
by the obstructors.
N.S.W. Labor-leader M‘Gowen, M.P., ex-
cuses his “ sinking of the fiscal question ” by de-
claring that Protectionism is “monopoly at home,”
while Ereetrade is “monopoly abroad.” If this
were so, even then M‘Gowen prefers to give
foreigners a “monopoly” that he denies to
“ home ” people. And M'Gowan was supposed
to be a Protectionist! But how can a protected
industry be a “ monopoly ” when all who please
may adventure in it ?
Senator Staughton is now the only member
of Vic. Assembly who never takes his monthly
cheque as a M.P. In cases of this kind the money
is placed to the member’s account in the Treasury,
and, although several members previously have
• refused to take the salary, the State has never got
a penny out of their self-abnegation. Chief
Justice Higinbotham never took his salary, and
the money remained to his credit till he died,
when it went to his widow.
One of the reasons why the motion in
favor of newspaper postage was discouraged in
N.S.W. Parliament, the other night, was because
many of the noisiest advocates for imposing post-
age on newspapers have themselves been caballing
to wheedle the Government into allowing their
own official correspondence to be franked. In
fact, the franking move was the Ministry’s dodge
to extricate itself from an awkward position with
respect to the “ great ” newspapers.
Melb. Age has a
hatred of all thing s
French. A bad sign.
In a recent leading
article the Age re-
marked: “With Eng-
land and Russia
friends, France would
be reduced to impo-
tence, or at most to
the rdle of a humble
member of the new
alliance.” The Pro-
metheus of Nations
has never been really
forgiven for having
stolen the fire of
Liberty from Heaven
—to burn the thrones
of anointed tyrants.
David Syme is a

Lots of Chinamen
are being brought into
N.S. Wales from the
Northern Territory
via Queensland. They
are “ coached ” en
route by agents of the
bosses at whose in-
stance they come
South, in order that
they may meet the
slender police-en-
quiries to which they
are (occasionally) sub-
jected. For instance,
to enable them to
make it appear that
they have already
been to Sydney, they
are educated in a
little jabber about
“ Lo’ Geolge-stleet ”
and “Plenty fan-tan
Go’buln-stleet”—also,
they are taught to say
something about An-
thony Hordern’s, the
“ big shop longa Syd-
ney ’’—andother little
details, calculated to
lend an attractive air
of verisimilitude to an
otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative.
Those N.S.W. electorates conspicuous for
the drunken habits of their adults, are found to
send as representatives to Parliament men who are
either bigoted teetotallers or almost complete
abstainers.
S.M. Herald seems to have been under
instructions, this last month or so, to so widen the
area of, observation of its leading columns that
when Federation is achieved its claim to be an
Australian daily will be easily maintained.
Murphy, M.L.A., a rotund publican-mem-
ber of Vic. Assembly, in a wild burst of eloquence
at 4.30 a.m., thus describes the Southern colony
and its people :
It is a country situated at the southern point of the
continent, bounded by the great Antarctic Ocean, which
rolls its waves around our shores. It is named after Her
Most Gracious Majesty the Queen. Its citizens are men
without taint; we are the purest of the British race, and
some of the cream of the Civilised world.

Two of Premier Reid’s appointments to
the Upper House were sympathetically condoled
with immediately after the Assembly decision,
disqualifying Ms. 1\ for paid seats on the new
Savings Bank directorate, was made known. The
names of two of the new councillors were asso-
ciated with the very first batch of appointments
expected to be made; and even Reid was so sure
of carrying the Bill with the £l4OO scramble that
he probably blushed when next he encountered
the expectant billet-holders.
Abbott, M.L.0., Vic., “claims that the
Leg. Council is every year getting more closely in
touch with the bulk of the people. ” Indisputable.
Practically, Vic. Leg. Council is the bulk of the
people.
N.S.W. Parliament House main lobby was
sefc °® w ith many polished specimens of
N .b. W. marble of varied tints. It is the freetrade
samt who likes to coquette with the darling sin of
protectionism. The freetrade party has no use
for native marble, unless to make tombstones for
native industries.

The new president of S. A. National Ass
is Beaumont Moulden, solicitor, Attorney-General
in the Cockburn Govt, of ’B9, who resigned
because of the introduction of the progressive
land-tax. He was thrown out of Parliament next
year, and has never got back.
Hardly any branch of the Public Service
is so mysteriously and often unsatisfactorily man-
aged as that which deals with the appointment of
Crown Prosecutors. Batch after batch of barris-
ters are picked and sent to and fro on no conceiv-
able basis of character or talent. The emoluments
are considerable and the work generally light, and
the frequency with which some white-haired boys
are selected makes a bold contrast with the ap-
parent ostracism of others. Can political patronage
be said to be abolished while this tipping of
favorites continues ?
N.S.W. Premier Reid tells people pro-
sperity has returned. Next morning this appears

The value added to the land of Tasmania
by the presence, needs, and expenditure of the
general community totals about <£8,000,000.
Fewer than 5000 persons have collared nine-tenths
of that increment. And the other 150,000 persons
in the island haven’t any idea how they are going
to recover it. Probably not more than 2 per cent,
of these consider they have any right to even hint
at recovery. Any legislative measure which comes
within eooey of a tax on land-values is cheerfully
blocked by the House of Landlords. That this
House is elected solely by the 7500 persons who
have snavelled the whole of the <£8,000,000 above-
mentioned is merely an awkward coincidence.
Dear Bulletin, —Why not tax the glaring
advts. on hoardings and dead walls ? Taxes are
imposed (1) to raise revenue; (2) as a check on
public nuisances ; (3) as a return for public services
rendered. As regards the two first, my proposal
fills the bill to a nicety. As regards the third, it
may be pointed out that not one of these “ads.,”
whether an artistic piece of printing or a public
eyesore, would be of value in the centre of the
primeval forest. Their worth lies in the thorough-
fares within view, and the constructors of these
are entitled to at least some of the accruing reve-
nue. Here is a precedent. The proprietors of
the harbor wharves and the railway commissioners
claim a monopoly of the advts. displayed on their
premises. Then these dead wall and hoarding
advts., are mixed up with the “unearned incre-
ment ” nuisance, and tend to keep land out of its
proper use —a good reason for doubly taxing them.
Such a tax could be most conveniently collected,
either by the State or the municipalities.—News-
paper Postage.
Tasmania pays £lOOO per day as interest
on her debt. In other words, every adult male in
the land of Sleep-a-Lot contributes 4s. a week for
the privilege of living in a country that was hope-
lessly in pawn before the present generation was
thought of.
F. 0. Gray, member for Prahran (Vic.),
the social-purity champion and suburban-wife de-
nouncer, is a prominent Orangeman. William 111.,

The only part of N.S.W. Civil Service
which received its salary-increase, after being
graded by the Commission, was the Education
Department, which got its small increases
promptly paid on Ist July last, the date whence
all increments throughout the Civil service were
alleged to date. Only two small classes of the
State school-teachers had their salaries raised
—the ex-students and those holding the lowest
grade of certificate, the “3C’s.” All the other
civils who have had their screws raised by the
Commissioners have been duly informed that they
will not receive such accessions of salary until
Nov. next, but that all increases will date from Ist
July. Why ?
Melb. University professors’ contracts with
the University council contain a clause forbidding
them during the tenure of their professorship from
becoming candidates for Parliament. It is said
that Prof. Jenks contended that this clause was
worthless, and ultra vires of the council, on the
ground that any contract between subject and

subject tending to prevent or restrict the selection
of the most suitable persons as representatives in
Parliament was against public policy. By the
way, this brainy Democratic professor, so scurvily
treated by the Vic. Philistines, has recently taken
another step upward by his appointment (though a
Cambridge man) as a reader in law in Oxford
University.


The late Baron Von Mueller was once the
subject of a vicious attack by W. M. K. Vale in
Vic. Assembly, that rabid teetotaler asserting that
the orders and medals awarded the Baron by the
various foreign Courts and scientific societies were
not given to him personally, but to his depart-
ment, and were therefore, by right, the property
of the State ; whereupon the Baron at once called
a carrier and despatched a boot-trunk full of orders
and decorations to Melb. Public Library. After
a week Or two, the authorities convinced the simple
old botanist that Vale’s remarks did not embody
the sentiments of the community, and the Baron
at length consented to take the gew-gaws back.
Bishop Wilson, of the South Seas, em-
phatically declares that Bishop Patterson, ‘ ‘the
Melanesian martyr,” was murdered at Nugagu,
not for religion at all, but because the natives
there took him to be one of the white men who had
some time previously kidnapped certain of their
tribe for work on Queensland sugar plantations.
Clancy overflows with legal trouble just

“After all,” says a Sydney daily, “the
amount which it costs the State to carry news-
papers free is not of great consequence.’ The
amount which it would cost the State to make
primary education absolutely free would not be of
great consequence either, yet education has not
yet been made free in N.S.W. S.M. Herald
says in a leader that the country couldn’t afford it.
It can only afford to carry newspapers free!

N.S.W. Justice-Minister Gould’s incau
tious remarks in N.S.W. Parliament re ex-Justice
Windeyer’s private report on the Suffield case
stand in bad contrast with the almost simultane-
ously-delivered comments of the English Home
Secretary in re the Chief Justice’s private repor*
on the Mrs. Maybrick case. Members of tin
Commons baited the Home Secretary to either
reveal the nature of the document or exhibit it,
but that official promptly replied that either course
was politically impossible. Poor Gould appears to
have first handed around the woeful Windeyer’s
screed among' the ex-Judge’s enemies, and then in
his place in Parliament blurted a construable
assent to their assertions as to the contents.

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her Life Miserable, but She i 9
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Bead the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg, Victoria, whose por-
trait is also given:
h
“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

Brady : “ Well, could you get it done chaper ? ”
Holdar M: “Re C. J. Towell’s queries
anent woman’s imputed preference for churlish
men. Woman prefers her man neat—undiluted
with effeminate ingredients. The suave male, of
whatever social grade, approximates the puff-and-
powder portion of humanity. Women resent
being approached in this way. The cases where
marital affection remains unassuaged by physical
violence constitute no great enigma. A wife
worth thumping is mostly considered worthy of
improvement. She recognises this assumption,
and knows likewise that the sting of bodily pain
is nought to the gall of contempt, the latter gener-
ally preceding desertion. Morrison minutely
grasps the situation in his ‘Tales of Mean Streets,’
where ‘ Lizerunt gladly accepts Bill’s ill-usage as
an exposition of real intentions.”
Street nomenclature at the West End of
London tells awful tales of unearned increment
pouring ceaselessly into the coffers of men whose
wealth in some cases gets no other form of adver-
tisement. Everybody associates G-rosvenor Square
with that bloated capitalist, the Duke of West-
minster, and Portland Place with the purchaser of
Carbine and breeder of St. Simon, but numerous
other streets, squares, and places are not generally
identified with the ground landlords whose names
are painted, for postal direction, upon the corner
houses. Cadogan Place, Albemarle-street, Berke-
ley Square, Cleveland Square, Ebury-street, Port-
man Square, &c. The outside world is just now
reminded that Lord Portman is a “ great ” pro-
perty-holder by his demand of .£400,000 from a
railway co. which requires 14 acres of his London
territory for a station terminus. His family motto
is “ A clean heart and a cheerful spirit.”

“Medicus ” gossips to The Bulletin
Dr. J. S. Hunt, of Hughenden, sent to America as a
special expert by Q. Government to investigate the
tick-plague, has in his practice had some remarkable
clinical experiences, amongst others being (in so small a
town as Hughenden !) three cases of cut-throat in seven
days—with recovery in all. One of these patients was a
police-constable, of whom Mackay rum had taken
possession. He severed the trachea and was taken to
hospital. A tracheotomy tube was introduced and the
wound stitched up. The wound healed nicely, and the
patient started for Sydney. Whilst coming up the harbor
he suddenly caught hold of the projecting end of the
tube, plucked it out, dashed it to the deck, and overboard
he went and to the bottom. And, as Hunt mournfully
remarks : “ After all the fellow’s efforts to save that
silver-tube the skipper of that ship was too infernally
careless to post it to me.” . . . Dr. Taylor-Young, of
Grafton, recently removed from the throat of a four-year-
old Oopmanhurst child a pin that the child had swallowed
nine months previously. The gradual decline of the
child’s health and the development of an abscess called
attention to the presence of a foreign body, with the above
results. There is probably no accident can happen a child
which gives a mother a greater fright than the’ swallowing
of some foreign body such as a pin, needle, or coin. The
first thing the mother usually does is, of course, wrong,
for in attempting to remove the body with her finger she
simply pokes it further dow n. Once in the stomach the
rational thing to do is to feed the brat on mashed pota-
toes for two or three days. . . . During the past year
there have been two cases of tetanus in Grafton, the first
of which recovered under antitoxin treatment. The
second case was a most typical one, having being brought
on by the patient receiving a cut from a green-hide stock-
whip. In this case the antidote was not obtainable and
the patient died. Dr. Taylor-Young owes it to the profes-
sion to publish his notes on these cases.

it has retrograded in another by refusing to allow

refusing to renew (or grant) a licence. An appeal
to the highest court in the land should be possible

At Port Melbourne, the other evening, a
young man got “run in” under circumstances
which suggest grand opportunities for the foorce
to combine business with pleasure. A constable
was playing billiards at a pub. when the young
man aforesaid came into the room. “He was
under the influence of drink, and began to use
very bad language. Some of his friends induced
him to go out, but shortly afterwards he re-
appeared, and, as his conduct was very bad, the
witness (constable) arrested him.” Fined 2s. 6d.
for being drunk, and 20s. for the obscene language.
It may be taken for granted that the culprit in
this case would have been hustled off the premises
(if absolutely necessary) and allowed to stagger
home in peace but for the fact that the constable
was playing “fifty up” in his holiday time.
Therefore, why not provide all the Hourigans,
, Hooligans, &c., with special beer-money where-
with to enioy themselves at the bar whilst off
duty ? Bad language is bound to occur occasion-
ally in front of the average hotel bar, and if one
constable or other, in plain clothes, were always
there ready to pounce upon the offender, a large
increase in the annual police returns would give
comfort and joy to the Social Purity Society.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

A member of Li Hung Chang’s suite said
in England that Li employs in his own private tea-
plantations nearly 400,000 people; he has over a
thousand managers, and ten chief managers over
the thousand. The ten are responsible to Li, and
they are paid salaries equal to about £ lB,OOO each.
When Li Hung Chang visited Her Gracious
recently, at Windsor, he was welcomed by the
royal piper “ wi’ a skirrl on the pipes, ye ken.’'
After listening gravely to its close, Li remarked
with an inscrutable smile that the pibroch re-
minded him of the music of his native land.
Which recalls how a Yic. resident of Caledonian
birth, had up for stealing a set of pipes from a
Golden Square Chow of musical tastes, defended
himself. “ Ah’ll no be denyin’Ah took the bit pipes,
ye ken. But Ah hold Ah was pairfitly justityit in
raiscuin’the nahshonal eenstrament o’ ma native
kintra frae the gripe o’ a yellow-gutsy heathen,
wha kames his wee pickle hair like the tail o’ an
auld soo. Ah’m weelin’ eneuch tae pye a fine
t’ye, but Ah’m dahm’d if Ah’ll gi’e bahck thae
pipes tae siccan a jahndiced-fyced birkie tae
deesecrate ony mair.”

office, ” writes a Bulletin corespondent, “does out-

made of keeping advts. out of the Cky.”
The Northern police are a lively lot.
A young man of magnificent physique, was
lately condemned at Croydon to four years
for horse-stealing. The prisoner had contrived
while crossing a flooded stream to escape
from the police who arrested him. After his
recapture and subsequent sentence he was lodged
in Normanton gaol, whence he made his escape
once more, to the horror of the whole Northern
constabulary.
Dear Bulletin, —Your sneer at Percy
Hodgkinson’s Centralian frogs is unjust. We had
one of those frogs on the Lachlan during the
drought of ’B2, and he watered 25,000 sheep through
a bad summer. That was before Percy’s “ black
boy ” got him, of course, but he has since yielded
a large supply of champagne, cigars, and lace-
edged serviettes for a banquet up our way.—Anna

SEVEKrTEEMTH REPORT,
PRESENTED TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AT THE ORDINARY GENERAL
MEETING ON 28th OCTOBER, 1896.
ANNEXED hereto will be found Balance-sheet and Statement of Accounts to 30th September,
duly audited and certified, showing a profit of -£2913 13s. Bd., which, with the balance already
at credit of Profit and Loss Account, the Directors propose to carry forward. It was hoped that by
this date the Bill to amend the Companies Act now before the Legislative Council would have been
passed, but as soon as it becomes law the necessary steps will be taken to write the losses referred to
in previous reports off capital, so that the profits available for dividends each half-year may be
distributed. . ,
It will be observed that the Cash Reserves have, as usual, been maintained at a high figure, and
the Directors are glad to be able to report that the volume of business has increased, although, owing
to the low rates prevailing, there has been no corresponding expansion in profits.
During the half-year one of the Auditors, Mr. F. S. Officer, has resigned, and the Directors, in
accordance with the Articles of Association, hg,ve filled the vacancy by the appointment of Mr.
Arthur William Cleveland.
By Order of the Board,

Lone-Hand Slocum.
The man who had sailed from Boston, U.S., to
Sydney in a 13-ton yacht with himself alone for
captain, crew, and passenger, sat in the Spray’s
little cabin, straddle-legs upon an up-ended keg,
and talked to a Bulletin scribe. He said : “ I’m
an adopted son of the United States ; I was born
in Nova Scotia just across the line ; I couldn’t help
that. I was eleven years old when I left school
and took to the sea ; started fishing in small craft
round the Bay of Fundy. I have risen from
before the mast to master mariner. lam 51 years
old, sft. lOin. high, and with clothes on 1461 b.
weight. In the days when I was second mate I
counted 1751 b. For years I have not turned it at
over 1461 b. ; I find that quite enough ballast; the
less I have to carry the quicker I can fetch the
jug. When I was 19 years old and weighed but
1351 b. I could spring round the rigging like a
monkey. Even now if I could but get hold of a
rope I think I could go most places. Yet my arms,
as you can see, are girl’s arms for measurement, and
no one on first sight would mistake me for a strong
man. I never took a hand in any athletic contests,
but the few times I had a deal at the punching-
machine my hit was the joker ; scored 601 b. heavier
than six-foot policemen. I think I just put my
finger on the key-note when I say I’m limber; if I
weren’t limber I’d fall out.
* * * *
“ Yes, round the world without a cook sounds
like a lot of indigestion, and the average man
would strike a rook every time he tried a meal.
But during my 40 years at sea I have often taken
a turn at cooking ; I practised first when I was 14
on a schooner’s crew. This trip, after I had put
in 36 hours at the wheel in the gale off Gape Horn,
I cooked myself the warmest and sweetest meal
I ever ate. I dodged the washing-up by hanging
the things over the vessel’s stem ; at other times I
hung my dirty clothes; the much maligned sea
did the washing beautifully. So far I have
traversed 20,000 miles, steamer’s reckoning. I have
averaged about 100 miles per day; my best run
was 1200 miles in eight days, from Cape Sable to
mid Atlantic before a splendid gale. My longest
spell without seeing land was 43 days, and from
Juan Fernandez to Samoa I spent 62 days without
seeing sail or individual.
* * * *
“ I believe in a straight line, a fast horse, a good
ship, and as much of the Bible as Science proves.
When the missionary folk from the John Williams
boarded me they remarked, ‘Yours is a work of
faith.’ But when I visited their ship I found
they had three of the very best chronometers.
Well, their practice is my theory. Perhaps they
had run out of faith just then owing to the large
orders required for the poor heathen islanders.
But I guess if the new season’s'supply of Faith
loaded them down below Plimsoll-mark they’d
have those chronometers just the same, and heave
the Faith overboard when thb ship wanted lighten-
ing in a storm. You see, mine is the usual mental
character of a 50-year-old man who has travelled
the world over in this 19th century. Amd just
here let me say, too, that sailors are not quite so
superstitious as landspeople.
* * * *
“ Understanding this, I will tell you plainly the
experiences of my loneliness. At first it was
novelty—my boat and I working our way across
the ocean. This idea, lasted for a number of days,
then gradually it faded away. I drifted on slowly,
ever so slowly, into loneliness. That feeling crept
stealthily into my being and took possession of
me. My previous experience of solitude was con-
fined to staying out a few times fishing overnight.
But now I was alone; utterly alone ! —a single
insect clinging to a single straw in the midst of
the elements. I began to live solely in those feel-
ings which Bayard Taylor says come only to sailors,
authors, artists ; to men who live with Nature.
The face of a man long dead rose up before
me ; my memory, never more than fairly strong,
now worked with a power which startled me.
The ominous, the insignificant, the great, the
small, the wonderful, the commonplace, it brought
before my mental vision in magical succession. It
showed me pages of my history which I had so
long forgotten that now, when I saw them again,
they seemed to almost belong to a previous exist-
ence. I sat alone with the dead whose faces,
faces, faces, rushed upon my vision. I saw the
dead, distorted face of a man who had been hung
by lynchers ; I saw the face of a child who slept
without breathing. Yet the remembrance of
seeing that child had not occurred to me for 30
years. I heard all the voices of the past, laughing,
crying, telling what. I had heard them tell in any
of the many’ corners of the earth. I played again
with schoolmates who had gone out of my life
with the closing of my school days. Songs came
back which had not been sung since my fishing
trips; I heard a fiddler playing a tune which I
had not heard since boyhood. All these buried
memories, rushing from their graves upon me, set
me pondering, pondering, on their mystery. What
is a man’s mind which unconsciously registers
every impression so wondrously ?
f * f *
“ In my loneliness, pathetic reading was bad
for me, who had felt all phases of life’s sadness. I
read Holmes’ ‘Elsie Venner,’ and cried over it
like a child. I closed the book, I paced up and
down the deck, with the unrestrainable tears fall-
ing. At that time I would have given my all for
a moment’s flash and flare of city life to break the
dismal spell. But it could not be ! I could only
walk up and down, and down and up, until the
feeling vented itself and left me tired out with
sorrowing.
* * » *
“I watched and worked, while the days gave
place to the nights and the nights gave place to
the days; I went on, on, ever on through the
light, through the dark, alone. I saw, I heard, I
feit, every mood, every nerve-impulse of the ever-
changing sea. And I felt secure. I would lash
the helm, and go down to bed, with my boat sail-
ing on into the night. As I closed my eyes I
knew that should danger threaten the sea would
tell me. So I slept, and as I slept the splash of a
wavelet or a warning roll would wake me. I
would rush upon deck and take in sail before the
gale could reach me. In my loneliness the sea
became a living being, a being so powerful, so
mysterious, that I understood why men in their
helplessness have worshipped it.
* * * *
“One night while soundly sleeping I was
summoned by a voiee—the voice of a strong man
hailing alongside ‘ Spray, ahoy ’ ! I sprang up.
Who was it knew my boat to hail her in mid-
ocean ? I rushed upon deck. There was no one.
But a white arch was upon the horizon ; a regular
screech er was tearing up from the sou’-west. I
took in sail, not a moment before the severest
gale of my trip struck me. When I was coming
down Australia’s northern coast, it was rather
important that I should see a certain seven-mile
light. I heard a steamboat whistle in a dream ;
in an instant I was on deck. No steamer’s lights
were visible, but just as my boat rose upon the
sea, I saw a flicker of the light on the sky-line.
Had I been a few moments later I would have
missed it.
* * * *
* ‘ Such experiences as these were not the
illusions of a fevered imagination ; I was never in
better physical and mental health than I have
been upon tins voyage. I ate, drank, slept well,
had plenty of exercise; I slept on an average
seven hours out of the 24. You must admit that
my brain was clear for thought, for calculation,
that my nerves were steady for action, when in
the 4000 miles voyage from Juan Fernandez to
Samoa I got but five miles out in my dead reckon-
ing.
* * * *
“Forewarnings, such as I have told you of, are
not peculiar with me to this voyage of loneliness.
One night when I was an 18-year-old seaman
before the mast, I stood at the wheel of the barque
Agra. A kind of dream stole over my senses ; a
voice said, ‘ A week from now you won’t be aboard
the Agra. ’ Then the sharp voice of the old mate
shook me up, “ Mind your steering there ! ” I
awoke and realised that I had had a vision, that
I would not be aboard the Agra a week hence,
and here I was in mid Atlantic. The night before
the week was up we were struck by a terrible
gale. I was sent aloft to the top-sail yard. I was
on the weather side ; I had hold of the bellied sail
with both hands ; it flew up and struck me in the
face and flung me away from the yard. I came
hurtling down, and I felt I was going to my doom ;
the thought of the vessel’s tremendous speed and
the rage and blackness of the storm showed me
that hope was hopeless; I saw the white foam
beneath and heard the swish and roar of the
waters. Then the main yard stopped me momen-
tarily, and, altering my direction, threw me upon
the deck. After a while they found me there and
carried me below and patched me up.
* » * *
“ I had a strange experience on reaching Juan
Fernandez. As I came close to the island the re-
membrance of Selkirk’s four years of solitude
caused me to take my hat off, to fall on my knees,
to bow my forehead to the deck. I had always
smiled at the salaam, and yet here was I, a
Yankee captain, on the eve of the 20th century,
going through the Mahommedan form, and doing
it because my feelings compelled that action, and
could express themselves no other way. It showed
me that a man who is intolerant of another’s re-
ligion hasn’t developed his understanding. This
voyage has taught me what I most desired to
know ; whether I was strong enough to execute a
long-cherished hope; to go with a few brave,
sturdy fellows to the limit of the South, and to
nail the American flag upon the Antarctic Pole.”

SPORTING NOTIONS.
This year’s go for Caulfield Cup was as uncon-
vincing as a good many previous struggles in the same
event. Let the same lot of horses run together on the
same terms a dozen times, and probably eight different
winners would be recorded. Four out of the eight might
get two wins apiece in twelve attempts. Crensorne would
need more than his fair share of luck, perhaps, to pull
him through a second time. Saturday’s race was of the
usual rough-and-tumble character; every jockey was
either trying to win or endeavoring to interfere with a
favorite, and the 20 odd steeds jostled round the circus-
track in sufficiently close order to make the result a mere
matter of luck within certain limits. This is not intended
as an apology for Tub Bulletin’s bad tip—not worse,
by the way, than the rest of the paper tips. Parisienne,
hot and fretful-looking before she left the paddock, was
among the majority that had no chance to win on the
day. Thunder Queen also shaped badly throughout.
Resolute and Hopscotch ran at the head of affairs for
more than a mile, and they, together, with Merman,
Straightfire, Cremorne, Le Var, and one or two others,
would be probable winners if the handicap could be con-
tested again to-morrow.
Cremorne was by some people reputed to be able
to win the Cup on his best form, also a whisper went
around, previous to the Toorak Handicap, that the old
horse had returned to his best form, but his very mode-
rate display behind Hopscotch in the mile race seemed to
put him out of the Cup. Consequently, Cremorne started
at “ any price ” up to 50 to 1. The hardened deceiver had
shown no “ form ” at all since May, ’94, when he won a 1J
mile handicap (Birthday Cup) in Sydney, giving a lot of
weight to third-rate horses, previous to which he had won
the Doncaster Handicap, beating other commoners. The
value of Cremorne’s best form was not easily estimated.
He had never taken-down a first-class performer in
a close finish, and during the last two and a-half years
he had suffered 16 consecutive crushing defeats. There
was little encouragement to put one’s bottom dollar
on this seven-year-old stager. Even Straightfire, another
seven-year-old, had a more tempting chance on paper,
notwithstanding that he was the most frequently-beaten
animal in the field. Considering that Cremorne and
Straightfire, on their joint record, have been in the habit
of losing races 11 times out of 12, or oftener, it should be
clear to the thickest-headed punter that anything (in
reason) can capture a Caulfield Cup. What a brilliant
specialist must Paris have been to win the lottery twice !
The Caulfield Cup has gone to Sydney four
times within the past five years. A Sydney horse hasn’t
won Melbourne Cup since 1886—Arsenal’s year.
Here and there a “ fly-flat ” will be heard whis-
pering that Hopscotch is to win Melbourne Cup because
his compatriot Cremorne took the Caulfield cake. Never-
theless, backers of Hopscotch for the two-mile event may
as well consider their money lost forever. Mr. Long’s
big horse came in beaten last Saturday, with spur-marks
on his ribs. Disfigured hadn’t been ridden a very hard
race, and the mare is likely to make a much bolder
show at Flemington.
Resolute certainly seemed to tire at the finish of
the Caulfield Cup when Straightfire tackled him, but in
the meantime the youngster had outstayed Hopscotch
and stamped himself a good one. Between last Saturday
and November 1 he will improve, if his feet give no
trouble, so his chance of winning the double—Derby and
Cup—is still worth considering. Resolute was not
punished in the Caulfield race, nor sore distressed on re-
turning to scale. Differently ridden the St. Alban’s colt
might have won.
Caulfield performances of Hopscotch, Cremorne,
Lieutenant and Cinderellen, all from N.S.W., indicate
that the Victorian handicap horses in training, four years
old and upwards, are a poor lot.
For the first time in many years neither the
winner nor runner-up in the big Caulfield handicap is
among the Melb. Cup entries. Nor is Merman, who was
placed foutth last Saturday. It is almost certain that the
Derby-winner will start first-favorite for the Cup.
Rekawas perhaps the most attractive youngster
in the Caulfield Cup crowd, and Many people backed him
at the last minute, on the strength of his good looks and
relationship to the redoubtable Portsea. The Sydney colt
is not, however, a second edition of his elder brother. He
takes more after his sire, Neckersgat, whereas Portsea
favored the dam, Lady Lovelace, from whom he got his
wonderful staying power.
TheV.A.T.C. might at least asphalt the small
stretch of road and footpathway leading from Caulfield
station to the furthest entrance to the grand-stand. Or
the railway authorities, who impose a heavy tax upon
r ■ ■ t.- un travellers, should supply this long-felt want.
The red Caulfield dust, besides being ruinous to clothes
IS actually, as well as figuratively, an eyesore. ’

to founding an institute whereat some of the leading

The law-ridden, stay-at-home Melb. bookmakers
aie resorting to all sorts of devices to carry on biz. One
at Prahran employs a cyclist at £1 15s. per week and com-
mission to wait on his customers. He is guaranteed to
distinguish a constable from “ a man ” under any circum-
stances.
* * * *
In reply to “Surcingle”: English jocks are
generally superior to Australian ones because there is
more raw material at ’Ome-there are twenty stable-lads
in England to one out here. They serve a long appren-
ticeship, under a strictness of discipline unknown in
Australia, and are well taught their profession (no whips
allowed at exercise, etc.). The English jock gets six
times more mounts than his ’Stralian confrere. Laudable
emulation and keen competition bring the best goods to
the fore—albeit Chris. Moore, James Hayes, arid light-
weight H. Cook could well hold their own anywhere.
* * * *
The Melbourne Stakes this year may not prove
a very valuable guide to the Cup. None of the crack
three-year-olds appear among the Stakes entries (as they
all happen to have a Derby engagement), nor is Broken
Hill on the list. The Adelaide horse, if he remains sound,
will be a puzzling chance for the Cup, presuming that he
doesn’t previously start in the Hotham Handicap.
Broken Hill hasn’t been seen at his best since March, ’94,
when he was a four-year-old.
The Officer has to win, or nearly win, the Derby
before good judges will fancy him much for Melb. Cap.
As a son of Robinson Crusoe, the colt ojaght to have
stamina, but he seems a trifle too high on the leg for the
Cup course.
Marusa is under treatment for shoulder-sprain
at time of writing. Given a speedy recovery, the brother
to Malvolio will be none the worse for his spell, but-, in
any ease, the public are not likely to back him heavily for
the Cup. He isn’t another Malvolio in appearance.
Bloodshot, it is understood, has lately been
“ losing ” O’Trigger on the training-track ; nevertheless,
the writer can’t fancy...the big-barrelled little Maorilander
for a two-mile journey. Bloodshot is the same stamp of
nuggety animal as Paris. He might, if fat, have been
dangerous for Caulfield Cup, but probably a shorter dis-
tance suits him better. Backers of Bloodshot for the big
Melb. handicap will be sorry to see his name among the
entries for the six-furlong and mile races on Cup-day,
which suggests that O’Trigger may be the Cup goer from
wily Ted Power’s stable. Not but what the entries afore-
said may be merely a stroke of diplomacy.

One doesn’t hear a word about bike-racing in
Melbourne just now, and not as much as usual about the

At last Hobart race meeting the bookmakers
were not (officially) present. As the new Gambling
Suppression Act comes into force shortly, Ikey Mo
declined to renew his license, so all the bets he made at
Elswick the other day were strictly on the silent nod. It
didn’t make much difference, however, as the Tasmanian
Israelite is generally an alleged Christian, who looks and
acts more like a studious professor of' biology than the
vociferously-aggressive person who asks you “Vat you
vant ? ” at Flemington or Randwick.
* * * *
A monetary testimonial is to be presented to
Mr. Thomas Pickernell (known on the turf as “Mr.
Thomas ”) in England, the most celebrated steeplechase
rider of his day. He rode 19 successive Grand Nationals,
winning three. In addition, he rode during his long
career quite a thousand winners the world over. He
began to ride in Tasmania in ’53, and after winning 50 or
60 races returned to England, and continued to ride until
April, ’77, when he irreparably injured himself by a fall.
He has had ill-fortune in speculation, hence the appeal
to the racing public.

An innovation at the recent Elswick (Hobart)
races was the “blind” totalisator. Big backers and
owners seemed to appreciate it, but the “ one ticket W
fraternity regarded the machine as a personal insult and
signified the same in the usual manner.

Detective M‘Manamy and his band, travelling
secreted under bags of chaff, have at last succeeded in
raiding the Collingwood tote-shops, so perhaps there'will
be a chance now for pedestrians to use the footpaths,
erstwhile blocked by the perambulators of sporting
mothers who had gone inside to bet. Small boys, too,
will be able to get home' with the beer now without having
to invent a fresh lie (for every wager) about losing the
family coin, or being robbed by big boys, or run over by
a bike. .i.

Had Melb. tote-runners kept quiet instead of
loudly proclaiming their contempt for the police, it is
possible they might have been left unmolested. This
truculent defiance of the law stung the authorities to
action. Never forget that “ authorities ” are human.

One Melb. tote-runner, lately arrested, is said
to be worth £20,000. He says he is willing to pay £lOOO
a year for the right to run a tote.
* * * *
Surcingle : “ Ascot sneaks up miraculously amid
the Melb. suburban gate-money meets. With £5OO added
money for one day—that before Cup Day—it quite attains
the dignity of a Caulfield off-meeting. Indeed, the V. R.C.
must look to these rivals, for it certainly does not advance
—nay, who can deny it recedes ? ”

The English great back-end handicap, the Cam-
bridgeshire Stakes, is to be run next Wednesday (Oct. 28).
Last year, the handicapper let the great-little Paris down
with 7st. 101 b.; this year, the galloping-machine has 9st.
up. Fit and well, he should have a show, as the distance
(1 mile 240yds.) is just to his liking.

The rich Futurity Stakes of <£Booo, run at
Coney Island, U.S.A., was won by the English-bred colt
Ogden (Kilwarlin—Oriole, by Bend Or). The Marcus Daly
crowd brought off a cleverly-planned coup, netting in
bets alone over £30,000. Could such a sum be taken out
of the ring here in one pop?
* * * *
The Rand wick-trained M.L. Sabretache (Cuiras-
sier-Roie) has gone to Melb. to take part in Derby and
Cup, for which events he has been well-backed by his
party both straight out and in doubles. If a surprise is
to be sprung, this weii-bred young'ster is the kind of
animal to effect i l .
No more convincing l argument can be urged in
favor of the totalisator than that supplied by Ikey Mo
and co. in their pusillanimous conduct last week re Mr.
Wilson’s commission for Resolute. Ever complaining of
want of custom, they, to a man, shut up their books when
tackled by Phil. Glenister, and refused to operate at a
longer price than ten to one. By all means, let the tote
and fair prices have a trial; owners are about sick of the
present state of affairs.

A Tas. country racing club, after advertising as
a condition that a list of performances must be sent with
each nomination, allowed a horse, which had been entered
by wire, to run. This horse won and a protest was en-
tered and allowed. In the end, the owner of the winner
sued the cluh for the stake, and the Judge held that it
must be considered to have waived its condition, and
found for the owner.

“Quite a large number of people turned up at
Waterloo Station to see the Australians ‘close their
innings,’” writes “Monico” to The Bulletin from London.
“ The crowd was not a paper representative one, and the
absence of the leading cricket-lights was conspicuous in
the gloom their appearance might have brightened. The
average English ‘ amateur’ doesn’t like those Australian
fellows, you know; why one of them was a common
minah ! and, besides, they take money for playing, in a
beastly business-like way, totally lacking delicacy. ’ The
E.A. never refuses a ‘testimonial ’—not a ‘ benefit ’ mind
—or a monetary appreciation of his services surrep-
titiously placed in his bat-bag, and his delicacy is of a
similar nature to that of the English ‘ Robert’ who places
his hand behind him so that his official pride may not be
shocked by the sight of the ‘ tuppenny ’ tip.
“ The Australians will have a lot more cricket
before they return to hear King Association’s opinion
about his slaves’ audacious insubordination. Their
troubles ! Now they will play for pleasure and pocket—
the professional’s earthly paradise.
“ Summarised, the record of the ’96 team is :
Played 34 matches, won 19, abandoned 3 (2 of which were
probable victories), lost 6 (4 undoubtedly, 1 through
picnicing, and 1 through over-confidence), drew 6, of
which two were likely to have been defeats. Gregory,
Trott and Giffen topped their ’93 averages ; Graham and
Trumble fell beneath. It is 10 to 1 Giffen and Graham
have made their last cricket tour. Trumble got 148
wickets for 14T6 runs each, as compared to 123 for 16'48
on his previous trip. Kelly secured 57 victims in 24
matches—3s caught and 22 stumped, and, as Trott says,
‘The Sydney people won’t know him when he gets back ’;
Johns got 25 in 10 matches—l 7 caught and"B stumped!
Giffen and Trott made 20 catches a-piece ; Iredale, 34 ;
and Trumble, 37.
“ Against English bowling Cliff, has made the
century, or over, eight times, Trott, 7 ; Iredale, 6 ; Gre-
gorv, 5 ; Darling, 4 ; Graham and Hill, 3; and Donnan,
once.
“ The opinion is expressed by the Weekly Sun
that if M'Kibbin were to stay in England he would be far
more successful with the ball, as the wickets would suit
him much better than those in his homeland.
“ Old Spoff. heads the English bowling averages
for 1896 with 28 wickets for 9T4 each. M'Kibbin comes
next with 101 for 14-26—his last 49 wickets cost under 10
runs each—and the champion English trundler, J. T.
Hearn, third with 257 for 14"28, he having howled 2003
overs ! Richardson has 11 wickets less than the Middle-
sex man for 16 - 32. In the batting-'Ranji. is easily top
with 57"91, and has broken the record aggregate with
2780 runs in 55 innings, beating Grace’s ’7l total bv 41
runs.
“For M.C.C. and Ground v. Yorkshire the
‘ Demon ’ Spofforth took eight of the champions for 74
runs. The match Was a draw.
“Charles M‘Gahey, a young Essex cricketer
and footballer, has gone to Australia to recruit his health.
He is an amateur, and one of the rising county’s most
promising colts.

Sydney ground trustees and M.C.C. to be allowed to share
the profit or loss accompanying Stoddart’s ’97 team ; but
met with a refusal. When the last team came out S.A.C.A.
declined to share in the risk in what then looked a doubt-
ful venture, and subsequently discovered it had missed a
share in about £BOOO. This time it finds it hasn’t even the
chance of saying yes.

Statistics of the Australian tour in England
show that Darling made 8 “ ducks ” out of 53 attempts,
whereas Jones, who"’played 41 innings, managed to get
through with only 2 round o’s.
English cricket figures for the season.
Of batsmen who played 35 innings and upwards
in first-class matches there were 17 who exceeded Sid.
Gregory’s average. Of the team that came here with
Stoddart in ’94 only seven—M'Laren, Brown, Stoddart,
Peel, Brockwell, Ford and Albert Ward—figure among the
first 75 on the list. Neither Briggs, Lockwood, Phillipson
nor Richardson got an average of 16 runs, whereas ten
Australians topped that modest standard. So The Bul-
letin rises again to remark that Stoddart’s team in Aus-
tralia was fortunate in winning three of five matches,
considering the weakness of its tail, and unless the next
visiting combination contains at least nine respectable
batsmen it will probably get done badly.
In bowling, J. T. Hearne fairly takes the cake. His
average is slightly’ below M‘Kibbin’s, but distinctly’ better
than Trumble’s, and he bowled 216 overs more than the
tw° Australians put together. Spofforth, who heads the
list with an average of 9’4, bowled only 127 overs during
the season, and his best performances were made against
the weaker county teams, so his record is not taken very’
seriously. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that an ex-
Australian comes out on top on paper. Taking Australian
and English bowling averages together, we get testimony
to the superiority of the “ colonial ” article as follows
Overs. Average runs
Spofforth ... 127 ... 9-4
M'Kibbin 647 ... 14-27
J. T. Hearne ... 2903 ... 14-72
H. Trumble ... 1140 ... 15T20
Haigh ... 586 ... 15-29
Attewell ... 1388 ... 15103
F. G. Bull ... 503 ... 16-
E. Jones ... 887 ... 16’4
So, whilst Australia has only four batsmen among the first
Britishers or thereabouts, she has four bowlers (including
Spof.) among the first eight. Which bears out The Bul-
letin’s contention that Australian Elevens are always
likely to beat All England on a bad wicket, and tolerably
certain to get beaten on a hard batsmen’s wicket, if
England wins the toss. Also, it goes to explain why a
team like Stoddart’s last, which was certainly not quite
representative, had a better chance to beat the Austra-
lians here than in England, inasmuch as the then crack
bats got a better show to make big individual scores.
Stoddart, M'Laren, Brown, and Albert Ward, not to men-
tion Peel, “came off” in one or other, of each of three
out of the five test-matches. And with .the aid of an
unexpected bit of weather-luck at Sydney they won the
rubber. The same team would not have beaten Trott’s
Eleven three out of five in England on average English -
wickets.

The pupil has become the master : Ranji. up to
Sept. 5 had scored 2780 and averaged 57 ’9 for 55 innings.

ENGLAND'S VISITATION.
EXCITEMENT IN YORKSHIRE.
(Prom the Huddersfield Weekly News.)
“Meltbam is ringing with one of the most
remarkable things that ever came within my
knowledge,” said a prominent member of the
Meltham Local Board to a representative of the
Huddersfield Weekly News. The case alluded
to was that of Miss Emma Haigh, who for six
years had been a helpless cripple. Rheumatism
caused her terrible pain in her drawn-up limbs.
She was treated both as an in-patient and an out-
patient at Huddersfield Infirmary, but was dis-
charged (so it was understood) as incurable, and
she retured home, “ probably to die ” as she
pathetically observed. The mother obtained a
supply of Hr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Before the
first box was finished Miss Haigh felt a change
coming over her, and by the time she had taken
four boxes she could sit up in bed and dress her
own hair. Two more boxes, and she was able to
get up, dress, and walk about the floor with the
aid of crutches. She persevered in the use of the
Pills and was restored to perfect health.
In further conversation with the Huddersfield
News reporter, Mrs. Haigh said that when her
daughter had taken the third or fourth box, she
(Mrs. Haigh) was standing looking out of the win-
dow, when she felt a touch on her shoulder, and,
turning quickly, she saw standing in the centre oj
the floor her daughter, who had never walked for so
many years. “My heart jumped into my mouth,”
said the mother, with glistening eyes, “and can
you wonder when I saw her as she is now, and
know that it is through the instrumentality of
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills that she is able to walk,
that I feel so happy and grateful ? ”
Is this not a miracle? A child given up by doc-
tors, discharged from the hospital crippled, and
incurable, and now cured by Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills after both Hospital and Doctors had failed.
These wonderful Pills are now to be obtained in
Australia, which must be a blessing, as Rheu-
matism is now a very prevalent complaint.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale people, con-
tain in a condensed form all the elements neces-
sary to give new life and richness to the blood and
and restore shattered nerves. They are an unfail-
ing specific for such diseases as partial paralysis,
sciatica, neuralgia, nervous headache, the after
effects of influenza, palpitation of the heart, pale
and shallow complexions, and the tired feeling re-
sulting from nervous prostration; all diseases
depending upon vitiated humors in the blood such
as scorfula, chronic erysipelas, &c. They are also
a specific for troubles peculiar to females such as
suppressions, irregularities, and all forms of weak-
ness. They build up the blood and restore the
glow of health to pale and sallow cheeks. In the
case of men they effect a radical cure in all cases
arising from mental worry, overwork, or excesses
of whatever nature..
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will for-

Spofforth has tucked hissleeve up to some pur-
pose in first-class English cricket this season, getting 28
wickets for just over 9 runs apiece ; he bagged six for 40,
and three for 42 in South England v. Yorkshire.
* * * *
Middle-aged, bell-toppered Englishmen went
“ratty” over the third test-match win—flung up their
hats like schoolboys, flourished their splash feet, and guf-
fawed, grunted, and squealed. If there’s one thing the
Englishman can’t take it’s a beating.
Albert Trott received 30s. a week in England,
£5 for every first-class match and £3 for second-class, but
pros, must pay their own expenses. No wonder even the
big men growl.
The laying-down of the cycle-track on Sydney
Cricket-ground now gives the ground-management the
power to make or break N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League at its
pleasure. The League, out of its meetings held on the
Cricket-ground from March to Nov., ’95, netted £2300.
Then it left, because it was charged 20 per cent, on the
gross takings—i.e., because it was asked to pay the same
toll as is given by those sports meetings held solely for the
object of charity. The League, since it left, has grafted
against a head wind up a steep grade, and it has gone
backward instead of forward in its bank-balance.
Now the Cricket-ground authorities have laid
down a £l3OO cycling-track for the obvious purpose of
using it. And they can either allow the League to use
the track on their terms, or else ignore the League alto-
gether, and run their own cycling carnivals. They
could secure the public’s racing gods, because they could
pay them more than the League could afford, and having
secured these, they could ensure public attendance,
because they can offer accommodation when the public
arrives. The importance of tjiis fact is proved by the ex-
perience of the opposition meetings which the two insti-
tutions held recently. Then, although the Cricket-ground
had only the lily-white amateurs, the mere ponies, as a
draw, it got twice the crowd the League did. Moreover,
the competition of the cycle trade will play right into the
hands of the Cricket-ground because it is better that
30,000 instead of 10,000 should see the fun and become
cycle-crazed in consequence. Further, as the cash cyclist
races for cash and not credit, he would, under a cash
temptation, forsake the League by the score and call him-
self an independent racer. Clearly, the people of the
shrunken mind and swelled head who run the League will
have to come down from their wheel and kneel.
* • * »
N.S.W. Wheelmen’s League always had a blind
eye for the main chance. One of the reasons it left the
Sydney Cricket Ground is that, at one of the League’s
meetings there, a certain cricket-ground authority nodded
some 50 people into the grand-stand. Fifty deadheads
meant a loss of £5, but the grand-stand that day paid
£660.
* * * *
“ About a quarter of the crowd which watched
Stanbury stiffening Harding turned up to see Gaudaur
stiffening Stanbury,” writes “Monico”from London to
The Bulletin. “The betting—what little there was —
proclaimed him favorite, but Gaudaur outrowed, out-
stayed, outstripped, and completely outclassed the Clar-
ence River man on Sept. 7. Whether two previous
defeats by Gaudaur weakened Jem’s backbone, or whether
he was stale or too fresh, it mattereth not, the fact re-
mains he made a sorry spectacle, and after three-quarters
of a mile showed himself a beaten man o.v his desperate
attempts to win on a foul. In his blind desire to ‘ bump ’
the Canadian, who had taken his water, he followed him
to the neutral centre of the stream, and having brought
the stem and stern of the two boats together, he ceased
rowing, claimed obstruction, and only w'ent on at the
earnest entreaties of his pilot when Gaudaur was three
lengths ahead. From that to Putney his body resembled
a sack of wet sand with most of its contents in the top,
for his shoulders fell forward, his back never straightened,
and there was an ‘ all-gone ’ appearance about and below
his waist-belt. Ido not believe he was at his best, but he
was beaten, and that badly. Jake Gaudaur rowed in
splendid form —of course he was winning—and if there
are two men living who can give him a race, there is hope
for sculling yet.”
* * • *
Weighing one story with another —Stanbury
met in Gaudaur a more artful sculler and a better stayer.
This time Gaudaur had Stanbury dead in nine minutes ;
in Canada both races he had him dead in the same early
stage. Gaudaur, at 38 years old, is a wonder ; in his
practices with Harding, who was his constant companion,
he paddled away from that other’s burster. In the great
struggle he went like clock-work, his sculls catching the
water with the ease with which wings catch air.
* * * *
Stanbury will accept the challenge issued by
Towns, the Newcastle sculler, and if defeated will give up
rowing altogether.
» * * *
Stanbury says Gaudaur was at aq. advantage on
the Thames', and would not do so well on'the Parramatta.
Stanbury, had he been wise, would have insisted on
Gaudaur coming to Australia in the first instance. As it
is now, Gaudaur, being champion, may possibly accept
challenges for matches in Canada, his own country, only.

Cycling booms in the West. The recent Cool-
gardie meeting, wherein Italiano Porta carried off all the
plums, resulted in a gate of £4sl—the first day. Melb'.

Johnson, Ohio, is the paradise of the cyclist.
The Municipal Council is already dominated by a majority
of the local league, and as a result most of its time is
occupied in seeing that “ justice is done” to bikers. Street-
watering was abolished 18 months ago, and for a year all
equestrians or drivers, on reaching the city boundary,
have been compelled to alight and lead their horses
within a space of 10ft. from the kerb, leaving the middle
of the road to the omnipotent cyclist. Having settled the
vehicular traffic, the Johnson Council is, according to
latest advices, devoting its attention to the regulation of
pedestrians, and it is expected that before the year is out
no one will be allowed to leave the side-walks except at
stated intervals and when fortified by a passport issued
by the league. During his trip in America J. W. Parsons
was banqueted at Johnson and horrified his hosts by tell-
ing them some of the medievalisms of Australia. Parsons
says Johnson is the most civilised place he has yet struck.

Another Italian, a veritable pocket-edition of
Porta, is training like A machine on the St. Kilda track.
He is small, hard, and leathery, and curls up tight on his

him, and should be a conspicuous figure this season.

The Scott-Morton road-race from Warrnambool
to Melb., 165 miles, seems to have occasioned considerable
bitterness amongst Vic. wheelwrights. It is freely stated
that various competitors were towed up hills and over bad
bits by too-energetic pacemakers. Apparently, the value
of a powerful tandem-team in bringing a man along is not
over-estimated by road-racers.

“ Why there should be any outcry against Par-
sons returning without having met any of,,the world’s
cracks on the racing-track it is difficult to understand,”
remarks a Bulletin correspondent. “As a professional
cyclist, J.W. left Australia with the avowed intention of
making money, and this he seems to have accomplished
without undue exertion'. Any man would be a fool to let
a certainty go on the off-chance of a trifling win. It’s to
the advantage of an accomplished crack to stand off as
long as he possibly can and rake in the dollars in the
meantime. This isn’t funk : it’s business.”

A coming cyclist young Lockington, of Rich-
mond (Vic.) Club, who retired from the Warrnambool
road-race through accident, after turning off the first 43
miles in 2h. 12m. He is only 16 years old, yet can last
and sprint with the best. But some of these youngsters
seem lost when they get in a race. In training all last
season there wasn’t a man on St. Kilda track, including
Zimmerman, Parsons, and Harris, whom Jack MJlnnes,
the 16-year-old S. Melb. lad, could not hang to, yet his
total winnings so far comprise one £7 race.

Michael, S. Johnson, the Yankee “ White Flyer,” whom 1
Parsons travdllfed with through the States, has just

Plugger Bilmartin made a fool of himself at
Adelaide on Saturday last. The trouble started by
Martin looking round and wobbling his machine after
Meadham had passed him. When called upon to explain,
William told the judge he was no gentleman, and swore
he wouldn’t appear on the track again. He did come out
again, however, and, afterrihe finish of the Flying Handi-
cap, in which he protested against M'Doneil for running
him out-wide, he rode up alongside his countryman t.nd
“swatted him on the jore.” William has been awarded a
rest of two months.
* * *
Martin’s striking M'Donell does riot surprise
anyone who knows of the long-standing feud between the
pair. And Martin seems to have had some direct provo-
cation, for M’Donell is said to have ridden so wide in the
finish of the Flying Handicap that Martin was bored into
the fence and bumped it several times. This, bracketed
with M‘Donell’s funny riding in his match with Martin in
Sydney, no doubt exasperated Plugger Bill. It will be
remembered that, when caked before ihe N.S.W. League
for explanation, M‘I)onell admitted that he had
wobbled across the track in front of Martin, but had done
so to give Martin the full force of the gale that was blow-
ing. All the same, M'Donell must have known just as
well as Martin the danger of the business.

A Wonderful Cure.
Hebe Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
you? window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence • recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your

The Chows in South Queensland have

The recent Murrurundi (N.S.W.) tragedy
(“justifiable homicide” was the verdict of the
coroner’s jury) in which a father gave his son a
fatal blow on the chest with the handle of a frying-
pan, recalls a true droving-yarn of the Diamantina
country, or thereabouts. The cook—a Mac, of
course—was frying chops for the camp. Some
niggers were hanging about on the cadge, though
the blacks in those days and parts were anything
but reliable. The pan, a long-handled one, had
just been laid aside, full of chops, when one
nigger, while Mac was fiddling at something else,
deftly nicked out a chop on his spear-point. Mac
noticed it and slewed round suddenly while the
darkey was about to make off, seized the frying-
pan, swung it over-handedly, axe-fashion, sending
the chops to anywhere, and brought it down clump
on the nigger’s cobra. The pan was fire-eaten, i
and, crack ! out came the bottom. The nigger
yelled and started off, but Mac had him
“ringed” round the neck with the periphery of
the scalding, fat-dripping pan at the end of a long-
handled lever, and he hiked him this way and
that way, mingling dreadful blasphemy with the
blackman’s howls, while the other darkies cleared,
terribly scared, for their camp, and the whites
mustered with their shooting-irons, in the belief
that blacks were attacking them—all in half-a-
minute. The nigger and Mac both fell over some-
thing, and the former, being the quicker on his
feet, got away, with the pan-rim round his neck
and the handle behind him. Till the next store
was reached, the drovers’ mutton, when “ fried,”
had to be spitted, chop by chop, on the nigger’s
trophied spear—dipped in the odorous bodies of
goodness-knows-how-many bush vermin.
A GRAND LITERARY INSTITUTION.
Cole’s Book Arcade now runs from -the centre
of the block in Bourke-street to the centre of the
block in Collins-street, Melb., a distance of 660 ft.,
and contains the following 17 departments, mostly
literary and artistic: 1, New Books; Second-
hand Books ; 3, Stationery ; 4, Music ; 5, Fancy
Goods; 6, Toys; 7, Perfumery; 8, Pictures; 0,
Artists’ Materials ; 10, an Ornamental Exhibition ;
11, a Japanese Exhibition ; 12, a Wonderland ;
13, a Smiling Gallery; 14, a Child’s Picture
Gallery ; 15, a Bargain Room ; 16, a Tea Room ;
17, a splendidly arranged new Wholesale Book
Department, containing half-a-million books. The
main walks of the establishment are half-a-mile
long.*
What would have been a ludicrous scene,
were it not so pathetic, was shown the other
day, when a miserably clad 10-year-old boy
was charged with stealing coal from a wharf. A
stout personage pushed his way through the crowd
to the witness-box, and drew off his yellow gloves
with the air of one who has 48 quarterings on his
escutcheon. He also wore a belltopper of dazzling
glossiness, and a 3oz. gold chain. Kissing the
book with a loud smack, the stranger announced
himself as a member of the big shipping firm who
owned the coal, and told the Bench a fatuous story
of the loss he and his partners annually sustained
through peculations from the wharves. The wail
of a strong Fatman in his agony was so affecting
that huge policemen nearly broke down, and
there wasn’t a dry eye in the whole assem-
blage. The final sentence of the despoiled mer-
chant was to tearfully ask the presiding beaks
to make an example of the prisoner with a view
of scaring the thieves who took advantage of
there being nobody about after nightfall. The
latter portion of the remark caused the Bench to
ask whether a watchman was not kept, whereupon
the local police stated that the big coal-CMTO-ship-
ping firm saved a watchman’s wages, and expected
the police to do the watching “on the nod.”
There was a long pause, and then the clerk-of-
court nudged one of the beaks, and the shivering
child was given six hours’ hard, while a deeply-
wronged capitalist jammed his immaculate cadey
on his ear, and strolled off amid the audible asides
of the scattered police.

The Australian Anglican Church is pecu-
liarly circumstanced respecting its titles in
Divinity. It desires and resolves to be education-
ally autonomous, but possesses no Australian body
competent to award a B.D. or D.D. degree.
Naturally it turns to the various universities, but
these institutions, constituted as they are and sup-
ported as they are, decline to give audience to the
requisitionists. Hence the dream of autonomy
is grievously troubled.

In a recent libel-action against Dublin
Freeman’s Journal for imputations in “ Letters

admitted under examination that, with one excep-
tion, all the letters complained of were written by
the literary staff of his paper. This paragraph is
reproduced merely to show certain Australian
newspaper-men that an editor, even in Ireland,
can just get the sort of letters which he thinks
timely.

A bellicose party named Armitage writes
to Melb. Argus scouting the idea that England
could, by any conceivable possibility, be ever
successfully invaded by an enemy, and says, with
a haughty short snort, “Bismarck said that an
army might get into England, but he did not see
how it was going to get qpt again.” Probably the
army that Bismarck had in his mind’s eye at the
time wouldn’t want to get out again.
“Pavements made of granulated cork
mixed with asphalt,” says S.E. Argonaut, “have
proved successful after two years’ trial in London
and Vienna. They are never slippery, are odor-
less, and do not absorb moisture, besides being
clean, elastic, and lasting. Near the Great
Eastern station, in London, the wear in two years
amounts to about one-eighth of an inch.” The
Bulletin always understood this invention to be
the patent of Mr. J. A. Parker, of Sydney.

Baron Von Mueller.
The world-renowned-botanist, Baron Von Mueller,
Hied This South Yarra (Melb.) cottage Oct 10, at
i9O a m Death was kind :it came suddenly and
gave’him the controlling wish of h« hfeptg die
while holding his beloved post of Vic. Govt.
Botanist For a year he had been fighting in
S£rsain«‘ the’dread that he might have a
lingering illness and be pensioned off. Justa
week before the end he arose at 6 a.m., and, with
the aid of two of his assistants, did his corres-
pondence for the American mail, and then wrote
to the Department that he was quite a,ble to per-
form his work. That effort was Ins death-warrant.
* * * *
With the Baron Science was everything : mone-
tary gain never entered his mind. He was a man
of the strictest honor, and the most intense com-
passion, absolutely unworldly, and he died quite
empty-handed. When the Govt, reduced his
official salary, he devoted a good portion of what
was left to keeping up a staff of private assistants,
and to paying for the stationery and postage of his
enormous' scientific correspondence. Nearly all
the rest went in charity. The trustees of bt
Kilda Cemetery a few weeks before his death
made him a present of a piece of ground. inis

tense gratification. The funeral, which was to
have taken place on Monday, was delayed until
Tuesday for the arrival frbm South Australia ot his
mnly sister, Mrs. W. M. Wehl.
Doctor Von Mueller was almost a Dane by
nationality, and almost more than a Dane by
heart. His mother was a Dane, and he was edu-
cated and took his degree at a Danish university.
He was born at the little town of Rysdeck, m
Schleswig—Holstein —once Danish territory. He
used to say he owed allegiance to three king-
doms, for he was a subject of Germany, and a
naturalised subject of England. He was a member
of every scientific society of note all over the world.
In his early Australian life he was Leichhardt s
bosom friend, and he lovingly cherished the lost ex-
plorer’s memory to the last. He was an ardent
devotee of Art and Letters, and more than one
artist who has gained distinction owes success to
help given by the Baron. The old doctor had one
disappointment at his death. „He dabbled a little
in poetry, and had translated Schiller s Rudolph
of Hapsburg ” into English; this he had sent to
Herr Louis Rabst to set to music. He looked
longingly to every mail to bring the desired sheets.
“For who knows,” he said with every disappoint-
ment, “ that I shall live another year !
’ * * * *
Some weeks ago The Bulletin notified that
Dr. Von Mueller would be grateful to residents m
far districts for gifts of minute plants, for, spung
being wet, he hoped to complete his work on
select plants. To his great delight this notice
brought him contributions from the most remote
regions. Some of these packages, with notes
accompanying, were awaiting classification at the
time of his death.
* * * *
Be Melb. Herald’s “ familiar description ” of
the poor old Baron’s dwelling, with the Baron
himself as stage figure. The explanation of the
old man’s eccentricities is simple enough. He was
poor—he gave freely to everyone but himselt.
“Never in my life,” he said on one occasion,
“ have I been able to buy myself a mirror ’’—hence
the old hat and rusty coat; but a constant stream
of poor people were getting relief at his door.
Then the Baron would never permit a woman in
his home. He had the most chivalrous respect for
the other sex, but fear of the scandal-monger was
ever before his eyes. A sturdy German butler
once had him in hand, bullied him, and kept him
in comfort. But the German died, and ever after
dust, cobwebs, and confusion held increasing
sway. Books, pamphlets, dried plants, swarmed
into every room. He cared everything for his
work, and nothing for appearances. Latterly he
never had a set meal, but ate his scanty food as he
worked.
* * * *
Baron Von Mueller had more titles than anyone
else in Australia, though his was a name that re-
quired nothing but itself to inspire respect. His
distinctive mark was a huge white woollen com-
forter which he wore winter or summer about his
neck. Formerly the director of Melb. Botanical
Gardens, he was responsible for making them what
is universally acknowledged to be the world’s most
perfectly-classified botanical collection. But,
advantageous though the Gardens were from a
scientific aspect, the Melb. public wouldn’t stand
science neat and howled for a director who would
give them a blaze of color, with the result that
Mueller resigned in favor of Guilfoyle. The fact
that he c*uld not run the Gardens as lie desired
always rankled in the Baron’s bosom; and in the ex-
traordinary monotone in which he always pitched
his voice, he would recite his plaint to all and
sundry even up to the time of his illness.
* » * *
Despite all his orders and decorations, there
was nothing of the snob about Ferdinand Von
Mueller; and, though a constant attendant at
society “ functions,” one man was as good as
another to the Baron in point of social position.
One of his peculiarities was his copious apology
for his ignorance of “ bolidigs ” —the poor old man
who had so steadfastly “ considered the lilies ”
seeming to think that everybody was looking
down upon him for his want of acquaintance with
the squabbles of Protection and Freetrade.
The Denton Grange, Houlder Bros.’ latest
big cargo steamer for the Australian trade, has
accommodation for 100,000 frozen sheep and 700

A Castlemaine, Vic., small boy, having
obtained some phosphorus at the local school of
Mines, started off home with it in in his pocket.
He caught fire, and, by the time he was put out,
the local fire-engine was half way to the scene.
Which recalls a yarn re Education Minister Pea-
cock, who, when a boy, found at the scene of some
blasting operations a quantity of powder with
which he filled his pockets; then he visited a
smith, who was sharpening gads at a forge, and
scared him badly by throwing a handful of the
powder in the fire. The memory of the scene that
followed, when it recurs to Peacock, causes him to
sit down with difficulty even now.
An Error in Administration.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Smith was brought up in the city, though
hi=ls had P been men of the forlst
and sea; and he naturally became a clerk. But
the blood asserted itself, and he threw away his
billet to go up-country, and finally got a job on a
Gippsland selection, where he spent his days and
nights in the “ cleared country ” with the sheep,
In Gippsland the country is thoroughly cleared
when most of the undergrowth has been hacked or
thev all stand"dead ** *'** ***** “
Such a country it bad for the nerves, especially
for thosjra mriike Smith, whose'fatfcr hail
not been particularly virtuous. It consists of an
interminable stretch of gaunt gray timber, and m
the morning and evening twilight the dead trees
seem to wobble their crooked arms towards one
another, and join their skeleton hands in a ghastly,
jerky minuet which makes your flesh creep. They
begin to do this when you have known them for
aboutaweek; and very soon, if you have a steady
head and an adequate supply of tobacco, they
stop, and turn into inanimate timber again.
But an ex-clerk who has been addicted to
inhaling cheap - cigarette smoke, and now
finds a pipe too much for him, sees
their antics for a good while longer. When the
darkness has put a stop to this entertainment, the
sheep sometimes get restless, and an unquiet flock
of sheep at midnight makes a most dispiriting
noise, which is a shade worse than the dead still-
ness. Sometimes, too, a tree falls without any
apparent reason just as you are dropping off to
sleep; and when a Gippsland tree comes down it
shakes a whole hillside and sounds louder than a
neurotic man.
* * * *
So it came to pass that Smith contracted
many little peculiarities in his behaviour. He
would spend hours on his back, looking up
towards the sky and trying to fix the out-
line of a tree on his mind, and it always vexed
him that he forgot one limb as soon as he
set himself to master the next. He began to
talk to the sheep like human beings, for he had no
dog ; and he swore at them because they did not
answer him in English, and he had forgotten the
French and Latin he learnt at school. He got
tired of the trees being so gray, and he took to
staining them with grass, and watering their
bises in the hone of making them sprout again.
He was conscious that there was something wrong
in his being out there all alone, and he came to
the conclusion that he had a deadly enemy some-
as himself; and it wasn’t the trees, for two of
them had fallen within a chain of his hut without
doing anv damage. After this event he regarded
then? especial friends, and laughed and
claimed his hands when the dance got more than
usually mixed—in the mazurka, for instance. Out-
side the twilight hours he sat still and brooded
over his wrongs.
One day the boss rode out himself instead
of sending a man with Smith’s rations, and ex-
plained that he intended to build new yards where
the hut stood, because the railway was going to
pass right there. The shepherd smiled, as if he
didn’t quite understand, and said that the railway
would find it rather lonely, and he hoped it
wouldn’t hurt his trees. “ They’re just learning
the quadrilles,” he said. The boss stared at him
and went away. Soon afterwards a couple of men
came and told Smith to take his sheep out of the
road and he drew off and watched them for the
rest of the afternoon. When it dawned on him
what they were going to do, and he savv the de-
struction of all his hopes of the grand chain in the
evening, he went up and asked who had ordered
it. Then he sat down and thought a great deal
about the boss, until at last he came to a decision.
* * * *
Now it is very clear that the Government
of Victoria has much to answer for. If it had
not decided to build that railway, Smith’s trees
would have been left untouched, and he might
have gone on quite harmlessly until it was dis-
covered that big timber was bad for his brain,
The sheep would not have been left alone that
night while a man with a sharpened knife made
his way to the homestead. The kitchen-maid
would not have been driven screaming along the
passage, three men would have been without a
very exciting experience of ten minutes duration,
and one of them would not walk lame. Also, the
boss’s only son would be two months younger and
a good deal stronger, and his wife would be able
to give an intelligent answer to a simple question
—which, as matters stand, she cannot do.
* * * *
Smith came out, probably, better than
anyone else. He was supported for six months in
an asylum, and then sent to a situation up Yack-
andandah way, where he will not see a stretch of
big timber in a lifetime. If he ever happens to
get into different country, someone will most
prpbably be murdered.

A Blue Funk.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was during the first year of the occupation of
Mashonaland by the British South Africa Co. that
Johnson and I, troopers in the co.’s service, were
despatched from Fort Victoria with the mail,
under orders to reach the next post-station if we
could, but not to tackle anything that was a swim.
The wet season had been with us for some weeks;
and anybody but a militia-officer just out from the
“ old country ” would have known that whatever
could be a swim was one then. The regulations
provided that one of the two men escorting the
mail should carry a rifle, as incursions by Mata-
bele impis were on the cards ; moreover, there
were wild beasts to be taken into calculation,
though, as we had seen nothing worse than hyenas
up to then, we had ceased to worry ourselves about
anything larger.
So, Johnson carrying a Martini with a few car-
tridges stuck in his bandolier, and myself leading
the packhorse with the mail, blankets, and two
days’ rations, we set out from the fort as merrily
as the constant drizzle would permit. “ Anything
for a change ! ” was our idea. Eighteen miles from
the fort we were pulled up by the Tokwi river in
full flood, so, making ourselves as comfortable as
we could, we prepared to eat our rations and
watch the river, prior to returning with an account
of its impassable state.
• * * *
The first part of this programme we carried out
successfully, and on the morning of the third day
packed up and prepared to complete it. Ail
desire for change, except a change of clothes, had
been washed out of us ; we were sodden with rain,
cold, and miserable. Neither of us spoke for a
couple of miles; then Johnson turned to me
and announced his intention of not carrying
the gun any further —he would strap it on to
the pack-saddle. I handed him the pack-horse,
and he dismounted and fastened the rifle firmly
fore and aft along the saddle, while I sat silently
watching him and inwardly grumbling at the
delay.
He had almost completed the operation when
the old, half-starved horse on which I was sitting
began to move restlessly, and, holding up his
head, stared intently right over Johnson’s shoul-
der. I followed his glance, and saw, for the first
time in a wild state, the king, or rather the queen
of beasts. A magnificent lioness was emerging
from a little belt of ti-tree-like scrub, not 100
yards from where Johnson stood, busily engaged
in rendering useless our only weapon of defence
should Her Majesty evince any desire to come to
close quarters.
Johnson was one of the crack shots of our troop,
but neither of us had ever faced big game, and I
don’t know how I looked as I pointed the beast
out to him. I do know that his honest brown
face went a bit pale, for she was walking very
slowly towards the road, not straight to us, but a
little to our rear.
“ There’s nothing for it, Jack, but to undo the
gun and have a shot at her,” I suggested, as I
struggled to put the desire (natural enough round
a camp-fire) to bag something big on top of the
creepy sensation the whole thing was giving me.
In what seemed to be about a fortnight he got the
rifle loose and swung himself into the saddle while
the lioness inspected our tracks, not more than 60
yards behind us.
* * * *
As we moved off at a walk along the road she
appeared to come to a satisfactory conclusion about
our scent, and followed at a slow, slouching gait
looking to this side and that as if for her mate’
who, I was pleased to see, did not put in an
appearance. It struck me just then that he was
an exceedingly sensible fellow who, when asked
to go out and look for lions, replied that he
hadn t lost any.
To speak the plain, unvarnished truth, I was
undergoing those peculiarly unpleasant sensations
which in combination form that unenviable state
known as “ blue funk,"’ and I felt exactly as I re-
member to have done when I first stood before a
monitor at school to be thrashed, and didn’t know
whether I should be able to see the thing through
or not.
The lioness had dropped back to about 120 yards
distance, and Johnson now unfolded his plan,
which was that we should ride along until we came
to a tree into which he could climb. From this
“coign of vantage” he would shoot the lioness
as she followed me along the road. He said he
thought he could make pretty sure of her if she
went by at a walk.
It seemed a plausible scheme enough, and I
agreed to it, and just as I did so the brute came at
a lolloping canter up to within 20 yards of us.
.“Just ride along as we are,” said Johnson;
“it’s the only thing to do; she’ll drop back
again. ”
How he knew, Heaven alone can tell; but she
did, and kept up this blood-curdling performance
for upwards of three miles along the road.
I began to get used to it, and my sensation of
fear was gradually replaced by one of extreme
annoyance at being hounded through the bush by
this persistent brute. Up to now', in any sport in
which I had engaged, I had always performed the
part of hunter. The tables were turned, and I
realised that being hunted was a very different
business.
I repeatedly pointed out to Johnson trees which,
it appeared to me, a beneficent Providence had
planted by the wayside expressly for the purpose
of concealing men who were intent on the slaughter
of female lions ; but he would have none of them.
I was just beginning to lose faith in his in-
tention to get up any tree at all—indeed,
it appeared superfluous, as the pair of us
seemed to be very much up a tree already
—when he suddenly jumped off his horse,
and saying, “Here we are; this’ll fix her,’’handed
me his reins, and in a trice was almost out of sight
in a leafy, large-branched tree.
The queen of beasts was at this time about 150
yards behind, and still coming steadily along. I
felt very much alone in the world as I fled slowly
before her, leading the two horses, and constantly
looking back to see how the game went. I had a
'450 Webley revolver in my holster, which I had not
reckoned previously in the armament. 1 now
drew it, and I remember that it made me feel
much less lonely, although I knew I couldn’t hit a
haystack at five paces with it.
When she was almost abreast of Johnson, the
lioness must have caught sight of the barrel of his
rifle, or something; anyhow, she made a bound
past him, and he, thinking it would be all up with
me if he let her go by, got a bit nervous, and, in-
stead of waiting till she steadied down again, let
her have it—alack ! neither in the brain nor in the
heart, but somewhere in the hindquarters.
If I live for ever, I shall not forget the growling
roar of rage and pain that she let loose ; it seemed
to come from everywhere. She stood still for a
second, but not half long enough for Johnson to
reload, and then came for me in huge bounds that
seemed to cover six or eight yards at a time.
Ihe feeling of annoyance had been growing on
me, and I now felt that I had a real grievance
against her for not having dropped dead when
Johnson fired. Fear had left me, and I was
simply m a furious rage with this brute for upset-
ting the plan to consummate which we had allowed
ourselves to be dogged, or rather catted, for several
miles. I was no longer the boy standing up to be
thrashed, but the same youth ringed bv backin'*
schoolfellows and stripped for his first fight, for I
had a queer sort of feeling that nearly everybody
1 had ever known was looking on at this battle,
that I must comport myself as became a man.
(Which proves conclusively that “ from the cradle
to the grave the mainspring of every action is
vanity.”)
It never occurred to me to try and get away on
my worn-out old screw, who had nearly suc-
cumbed to “ the sickness ” only a week or two
before ; and it was just as well it didn’t, for in
that case it’s about 5000 to 1 that I should not be
telling this yarn. Instead, I jumped off and
waited for her with the Webley.
* * * *
Johnson Was on the ground by this time, and
the raving maniac of a she-lion was in a bee-line
between us ; but out of the tail of my eye I saw
him start to run out from the road and towards
me, in order to get a shot that would not endanger
me, and as there seemed to be unlimited time in
which to think things over, I was enabled to put
in a fervent blessing for Jack Johnson and an
anathema on myself for having doubted him.
I had read plenty of yarns in which men had
hunted lions and killed them, and although in this
case the lion had hunted the man and seemed bent
on seeing the sport right through, I concluded
that she would behave after the manner of yarn-
lions to the extent of stopping a yard or two off
for her final spring. She did so, and when there
was nothing but about twelve feet of space be-
tween us, I dropped a ball from the Webley into
her off fore-foot.
I could hardly have done anything better to
hasten the crisis. She patted the wounded paw
on the ground, and then crouched the whole of
the fore-part of her down almost to the ground for
the annihilating effort.
My finger was pressing the trigger to discover if
the Webley, having captured her hand, could not
now lay siege to her heart, when the Martini rang
out clearer than any joy-bell. The queen of the
forest leapt straight into the air, and, while I
executed a movement to the right, fell, stone-
dead, almost exactly where I had stood.
I felt very much inclined to fall upon Johnson’s
neck and do what is generally done by people who
fall upon that part of their friends, but controlled
myself and merely shook hands with him, saying,
“ Thank you very much, Jack, that was a rattling
good shot.”
Three hours afterwards we rode triumphantly
up to the fort with the troop’s first lion-skin.

It was recently complained that the Lee-
Metford bullets had no “stopping” power.
Someone has found that bullets with a small hole
through the centre will, for some unknown reason,
stop an elephant. Solid bullets drilled clean
small holes through an inch plank, while perfo-
rated bullets from the same rifle smashed the
plank to splinters. Also, it has been found that
perforated sails propel a ship or boat far faster
than sails without holes in them.

That round each dying rose a glamour weaves,
Our lutes shall sound to many an olden song —
Songs sung by countless lovers past and dead—
Sweeter, perchance, since we shall pass ere long,
And songs are hushed when grass grows over-

We soon shall pass! Like the white-shrouded shape
Throned under gleaming lamps in Khem of old,
When wine-flushed revellers watched the night

That seemed to bid them “ Drink, thy lips

The words are ever trembling in our ears.
Then why should eyes be wet with blinding tears,
Save only those of over-joy that creep
’Neath twice-kissed lids that know not why they

In the Great Mother’s breast to sleep again.

Beware Cheap Substitutes.
One of numy Testimonials.
Adamstown, 11th September, 1896.
& Co., Manufacturers of Irish Moss.
Dear bin,—Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I desire to
add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss, As a soother of irritating cou<di with much ex-
pectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything I have tried. It loosens the mucus
which, therefore, comes more readily away, and the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
Yours respectfully, THOMAS STOKER.
