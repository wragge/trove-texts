Even if you picked one with your eyes shut
it wouldn't really matter - they're all Parkers!
They all do clever things—like when you push the clicker button. On a
Parker ball pen the entire ref ill will rotate one quarter turn. So, less wear!
aAnd that isn’t the only clever thing about a Parker ball pen. The ball
point cant skid or skip, because the ball is textured and impregnated with
diamond dust, c All of them will write up to 80,000 smooth, flowing words
on one refill. aAny Parker ball pen makes a wonderful gift for a relative or
friend. fAnd most of them can be. matched with a Parker pen. So if you
want your gift to say something extra special match a Parker ballpoint
with a Parker pen!

The thought of Scotch or a Brandy with Coca-Cola sounds a bit way out

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
The sporting way to
get rid of those
messy crowds
BATMAN, AS EVERYONE knows,
is a mighty force for conquering evil.
For over a year now your hero has
been working on a plan that eventually
will be of marvellous assistance to the
Victorian Football League, the Lawn
Tennis Association of Australia, the
VRC, the AJC, etc., plus all the
assorted authorities that control Soccer,
swimming, athletics, boxing, you name
it.
Talking as one of Australia’s lead-
ing non-spectators, it seems to me an
interesting fact that there is hardly a
sport that is gathering a paying public
along with the growth of population.
Actually most of them are going the
other way. After tediously adding up
figures for hours, the Batman survey
for the first nine VFL rounds in 1967
was 1,346,098; for 1966, 1,402,796; for
1965, 1,379,915; and 1964, 1,463,893.
Get the picture. This is the worst
year for four years and we are down
117,795 on 1964.
Or take racing. A good meeting
these days is a paltry 25,000 and the
spanking new track of Sandown is
lucky to gather 20,000. Well, for the
past six Melbourne meetings through
June and July we have had a total of
130,563. The same six meetings in
1957 fetched 162,697.
Am I boring you? Hang on, there’s
a message coming eventually. Take
athletics. A good meeting is turned on
at Olympic Park and you’re lucky if
you get as many spectators as athletes.
The spectacular feature of the pro-
fessional tennis this year was the acre-
age of empty seats, and it was the same
for the State championships. The
Salvation Army draws a better crowd
at Festival Hall than boxing. Swim-
ming has this advantage— at the State
swimming titles you have a 100 or so
competitors, which means that every
girl and every boy has a mummy with
possibly a dad as well, so this helps.
Yet the only time swimming drew a
crowd this year was for the international
meet with the French champions.
As for cricket, sometimes for a State
match the only people at the ground are
Sir Robert and Arthur Calwell. Soccer
is fairly static—the average for each of
three matches on a Saturday is 4000
and maybe 5000 on a Sunday. It’s
small-time.
If any major business was losing cus-
tomers at the rate they are being lost
by football or racing it would be
alarmed. There would be a major
sacking of directors. The VFL now
attracts slightly over six percent of the
population compared with more than 11
percent in 1930. Yet, so far as this
column knows, there have been no
investigations, no sociological surveys to
find out why. One suspects that the
affluent society, with its motor-cars, is
no longer in such need of cheap enter-
tainment.
But let’s get on to what shall herein-
after be described as the Batman plan.
The answer is television and the doing
away with live spectators. They don’t
really want to go, so why have them
present?
At the moment all sport is terrified
of TV. For example, when the Mel-
bourne Cup is run, this great event is
banned from our screens, yet it is shown
live in other States. As a typical Mel-
bourne viewer, I feel this is an injustice.
The Melbourne Cup should be run
occasionally at Randwick so that we
could look at it on our screens. Un-
questionably, the AJC in Sydney would
be only too happy to co-operate.
We have a similar problem with the
Davis Cup. When it is played in Mel-
bourne it is banned from our screens.
Ah, but when it is in Sydney, Brisbane,
or Adelaide, we get it live. Frequently
one has had the comfort of watching the
Davis Cup at a seaside house, martini in
hand, blue ocean out the window.
Always this page will have a firm policy
that the Davis Cup should never be
played in Melbourne.
Football is the same. The masters of
the VFL know that deep down the red-
blooded, true Melburnian adores trek-
king out to football grounds, battling
for parking spaces, and standing ankle
“Why’re they worried, about falling
attendances at the footy and races
they should be grateful!”
deep in beer cans. He knows that stand-
ing out in the rain is good for his spirit
and that queueing up for a urinal is all
part of mateship. He wouldn’t want to
swop all this for an armchair before the
television in front of a fire. But the
VFL don’t take any chances. They give
no live TV of VFL footy, only replays
at night when suspense has gone. The
crowds they do have are maintained
only by TV blackmail.
The solution to the whole terrible
problem is this: let us create, say, four
or five national TV sporting centres.
An ideal location for one would be Mil-
dura, where there is a guarantee of
low rainfall and good water supply for
playing fields. Here we would have a
football-cricket ground, racetrack,
tennis courts, cinder track, swimming-
pools, the whole works, plus a whole TV
industry. Sentimentalists might want
crowd reaction, but this could be
dubbed in. Alternatively it would be
good decentralisation of industry for
Mildura to provide professional specta-
tors for all sports, like extras for “Ben
Hur,” all waving their Collingwood or
Richmond streamers when required.
Don’t you see the advantage? Never
again would a Test match be delayed;
all our sporting fixtures would be con-
ducted in glorious weather. There would
be no more mix-ups or wash-outs as at
Doomben this year. Seeing that the
TAB is now providing so much money,
the racing clubs would be only too
happy to fall in with this idea. > For
some time now spectators have been
only an economic nuisance. Sandown
Park is an example of this.
Other sports could gain either by a
share of the advertising revenue from
the TV stations or by a coin-in-the-slot
system. Sporting clubs would save
money by not having to provide expen-
sive grandstands, cleaning staff, to say
nothing of the paying off of huge
interest debts.
Then it would be possible to get rid
of all the various stadiums in Mel-
bourne, Sydney, Brisbane, etc. Fleming-
ton, provided with lakes and a nice dis-
play of native trees and shrubs, would
make an utterly charming park. The
Housing Commission, with a little care-
ful subdivision, could easily convert the
Melbourne Cricket Ground into flats
with lan Johnson as superintendent.
The central arena would make a lovely
play area for children and a good spot
for hanging the washing. Randwick
could be a public golf links. Sydney
really needs one there.
I can see now that you are as
excited as I am. The possibilities in
this for city improvement are immense.
Bigger crowds get to watch their
favorite sports in greater comfort. TV
stations please the Control Board by
boosting their Australian content. Glory
be, it would be as high as 99 per-
cent. We would do away with all the
dreadful business of congregation of
crowds. People are really awfully
messy and you don’t want them around.
There’s just one difficulty. Firms
like Four’N’Twenty, who have pie con-
cessions, will fight it tooth and nail.

The extra
achievement was
feeding them
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
AND AFTER THE Women of Achieve-
ment lunch at the Wentworth is over
Geoff Moore, the assistant audio engin-
eer, slaps on some hot rhythm and a
waitress down below in the Grand Ball-
room yells, “Aw! Give us a vocal, Geoff.
Go on,” and transmits what she con-
siders a persuasive smile in his direc-
tion.
There are still a few women of
achievement left, gathering up flower
decorations they’d arranged early that
morning, and winding up yards of pink
tulle they’d flicked artistically round the
table illustrious, where Lady Casey had
sat and Mrs. Robin Askin and Mrs.
John Armstrong, hat to hat with the
hierarchy of the National Council of
Women of New South Wales.
If for no other reason, this lunch
will be remembered by the Wentworth
management for its size. Ballroom staff,
accustomed to serving at the most 500,
battle to feed these 800 hungry females
who look, in their brightly colored
clothes, like one huge never-ending dol-
lop of Cassata ice-cream spread between
rows and rows of tables. They have
travelled miles and paid $4. For what,
jokes a council member to see the
Wentworth or to see Lady Casey?
Another 800 applicants were regretfully
turned down, and there’s Miss Jean
Arnot, immediate past president of the
NCW, looking up at the mirrored ceil-
ing saying wouldn’t it be wonderful if
they could have had the other lot up
there . . .
Up in his box, Geoff keeps the room
at a steady 72deg. temperature, slips
on his jacket and plays the Queen —the
Queen! for lunch? Well, it’s by special
request removes his jacket and keeps
an eye on lights. His orders are not
to lower them or someone might ignite
the candlesticks; it’s psychological you
know, and definitely not etiquette for
lunch. He’s always learning something
is Geoff. It certainly won’t look like
this tonight. Tonight Geoff’s got Sir
Robert Menzies and Harold Holt for
the Harvard Club dinner. Lots of
lowered sexy lights for them. Three
hundred paunches spread comfortably
down there. 2GB’s asked for the
speeches to be taped. They said he
might as well record the Women of

Achievement, too, while he was about
it.
Lady Casey taps one of Geoff’s $240
mikes. The tap reverberates into the
last gulp of Chicken in Paprika Sauce,
a fearfully technicolor dish that clashes
somewhat with the decor, and Lady
Casey says, “Is that all right, can you
hear me do you think?” Eight hundred
female voices reply Yeeeeeeesssssss,
loud and clear, and if 2GB’s not pleased
with that they’re not pleased with any-
thing. Unlike Mrs. Scotford, president
of the NCW, Lady Casey doesn’t think
women are doing enough these days.
Shouldn’t, she asks, shouldn’t women be
getting into a closer partnership with
men? Why are there so few women
represented in the Australian Parlia-
ment? Is it lack of confidence or
could it be the Sales Resistance of
Men?
Miss Arnot likes that. Sales Resist-
ance of Men. “It’s a lovely phrase, and
I will remember it . . . the women of
Australia have places to GO” she cries,
slapping the table, and Cyril, the head-
waiter, standing at ease by a magni-
ficent display of gladioli, keeps his face
very, very straight.
Over on table four, whereat sits
probably the most formidable collec-
tion of matrons ever to be seen en
masse in public, one leans over to Mrs.
Bill Wentworth and asks if she didn’t
do yoga once? Yes, but only once. She
went along and there was a huge fat
woman with her buttocks in the air
being asked to do the scissor move-
ment with her legs. She’ll never do
it, thought Mrs. Wentworth, but she
did. Actually, she only wanted to
touch her knees with her forehead but
after that gave it up. What Mrs. Went-
worth wants to achieve this year is an
engagement ring—she hasn’t got one —
but as half the year has gone already
she is not too optimistic.
Mrs. Scotford rises and proposes a
Vote of Thanks to Lady Casey. It
comes in the shape of a book entitled
“Women In A Changing World —the
Dynamic Story of the International
Council of Women since 1888” and, ex-
plains Mrs. Scotford, it goes right up
to 1966. Then at two o’clock the party
is over.
Outside the ballroom, on the same
third floor, Mr. S. W. Longbottom
winds up his little business luncheon in
the Barossa Room. Next door in the
Hunter Room the 45 members of the
Scandinavian Businessmen’s Club spill
out from their monthly conclave over
smorgasbord. “My word,” Niels Basse,
the Danish Commercial Counsellor, is
saying, “my word. Eight hundred
women!” Yes, and they all receive a
miniscule bottle of Je Reviens eau-de-
cologne, tucked for safekeeping into a
little white card. All Mr. Basse’s
businessmen get is a packet of chewing-
gum.
Geoff says he’d better get down to
the ballroom and rescue his two micro-
phones. The Wentworth’s got $140,000
worth of sound equipment. He wants
to keep it that way.

MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Letting off steam
around the
chafing dish
MY HUSBAND is a frustrated cook.
Next to his work and his cellar
he loves food best of all. No meal can
be prepared in our house without a
visit from the expert. Cigar in one
hand, a glass in the other, he leans
majestically over the pot and sniffs:
the seasoning has to be adjusted; the
dish hasn't cooked quite long enough,
in his opinion; the spoon 1 am stirring
the sauce with is changed from silver
to wood (which is not always correct,
but something he cannot begin to
understand); or, if he really cannot
think of anything else, the plates we
are about to use are still not quite hot
enough.
As heated arguments before eating
a meal tend to upset my gastric juices,
I have devised a method to keep him
lying low. I make all the preparations
for the food during the day, and cook
everything I can before the last minute
so there is very little left that he
can interfere with.
To keep him happy I have also
devised a number of dishes that he can
participate in. The food is prepared
in advance, brought to the table, and
then he can add the finishing touches.
Let him loose with a bottle of metho
and a chafing dish, and what fun he
does have to listen to him at the
table you'd think he had been slaving
over a hot stove all week!
Cheese fondue is a marvellous ex-
perience for four to six guests at a
sit-down dinner (before or after the
main course), and gives you the oppoi-
tunity to enjoy wine at its best.
You need a fondue set a spirit
lamp and a deep pot or chafing dish.
Copper is best, but earthenware can be
used. Set the spirit lamp in the middle
of your table, give everyone a little
plate and a long fork for spearing the.
bread, and give the man of the house
(if he is inclined to cook) a tray with
all the ingredients set out.
These are: a bowl with lib.
coarsely shredded gruyere cheese, \
tablespoons of flour on a saucet,
clove garlic, a large glass of dry, " lte
wine, half a wine-glass of cognac, sat,
pepper, and nutmeg. ,
The fondue dish must be well n|
with garlic. Sprinkle the cheese w>
flour. Pour the wine into the chating

dish and set over a low flame. When
bubbles begin to rise, stir with a fork
and add cheese by the handful. Let
each handful completely dissolve before
adding another. Under no circum-
stances allow the mixture to boil.
Gruyere can get very stringy if you let
it boil.
When all the cheese has dissolved
and the mixture begins to bubble, add
a little salt, freshly ground pepper,
and a dash of nutmeg. Continue to stir
and add the cognac. The dish is now
ready for dipping.
Have a long, thin, crisp french loaf,
cut into bite-sized pieces on the table,
and, when the fondue is bubbling, let
your guests spear a piece and dip.
Regulate the heat from time to time,
as the fondue must be kept bubbling
but not boiling. If the dish begins to
get too thick, add a little more, cold
wine and stir.
After a beautiful home-made soup,
beef fondue, cooked at the table, can
provide a lengthy and pleasant way to
spend an evening at the table with a
few close friends.
For this you will need the deep type
of fondue dish, and the oil will have
to be heated on your cooker and
brought to the table spirit lamp when
really very hot. I find it prudent to
leave the cooker switched on and re-
heat the oil from time to time.
I ordered a beef fondue not long
ago in a Sydney restaurant and it
was the most tasteless and expensive
dish (for what we received) that I
have ever eaten. If you have had a
similar experience, try it at home and
you’ll be amazed at how good it can be.
For four people (which is about as
much as any one chafing dish can
handle successfully) you will need 21b.
of fillet steak cut into lin. cubes. Mari-
nate for at least 24 hours in your fav-
orite mixture. (For mine I use 1 large
grated onion, 3 or 4 crushed cloves of
garlic, chopped parsley, thyme, a bay-
leaf, a stick of celery chopped finely, \
teaspoonful of cinnamon, a sliver or
two of orange peel, salt, freshly ground
black pepper, a small wine-glass of olive
oil, half a glass of wine vinegar, and \
bottle of red wine.)
When required, the meat is drained
of its marinade and brought to the
table on a platter surrounded by sprigs
of parsley. The pieces are speared and
cooked by each guest to his or her taste.
I like a baked potato, split and topped
Wl th sour cream and chopped chives,
a nd a salad as its only accompaniment
apart from the sauces.
I usually serve three or four differ-
ent sauces with this dish, each one
poured into a little bowl, so that guests
can sample a variety of flavors.
While my husband is seeing that the
guests don’t burn the house down, I
ar n whipping the sauces together at the
last minute. For one, I beat pint of
cceam until stiff, add \ a jar of horse-
cadish, and mix until blended. For
another, I make a roux of butter and
hour and stir in 2 tablespoons of french
bustard, then blend in a little cream

until smooth. You will no doubt enjoy
experimenting with a few sauces your-
self, and thus make the dish individual
Cooking at the table is a speciality
of the Japanese and one intriguing dish
of this nature is tempura something
we often serve as a start to an Eastern-
style meal.
The secret lies first in the batter
and secondly in the variety of the sea-
food and vegetables to be served. For
the batter you require 1 cup plain flour
mixed well with | cup cornflour. Make
a well in the centre and break in 1 egg.
Stir quickly and lightly into the flour
with the addition of 1 cup of iced
water.
Per person allow the following items:
2 small green prawns, 2 small pieces of
white fish, 2 small pieces of squid (if
you can stand it), a sprig of parsley
(previously dipped in iced water to keep
crisp when frying), 2 spring onions, two
pieces of green capsicum.
The oil in which your tempura is to
be cooked at the table should be a mix-
ture of 2-3rd sesame oil and 1 -3rd
peanut oil, and must be fresh—it's no
good using oil left over from a chafing-
dish meal.
Take the prawns, or whatever you
decide to start with (the order is up
to you), dip in batter, fry, and serve
to everybody. Then cook and serve a
single vegetable, and so on. Give every-
one a little bowl of sauce: a mixture of
soy sauce, grated white radish, or horse-
radish, a little grated ginger, a pinch
of sugar and monosodium glutamate,
brought to the boil, with a dash of
sake added if you have any, and served
hot or cold.
On other occasions I might just
decide that the dessert will be the
flaming dish of the night. Crepes
Suzette, of course, are always popular
and terribly easy to make. Prepare
your pancake mixture in the morning
and keep in the refrigerator until late
afternoon. Then make very thin crepes,
brown them well, drain them on absor-
bent paper and stack them, one above
the other, with a piece of glazed paper
between each one. (A lot of people fold
them up but I find that they get too
sticky for my taste when stored like
that.)
The spirit lamp is lit, a tiny nob
of butter melted in the hot pan, and
two crepes are folded into the pan.
(This is my way of doing it, by the
way, and not the orthodox procedure.)
When heated through they are sprinkled
with sugar, seared, sprinkled with a
mixture of orange and lemon juice
prepared in a little jug, and simmered.
Then we add whatever our liqueur cup-
board has on offer. A little orange cura-
cao is best. When it begins to bubble
a dash of cognac is added and the pan
tippc„d to flame the crepe. Very yummy.
Another delicious way of serving
the crepes is to spread them very lightly
with apricot conserve, then dust with
grated walnuts, roll them up and flame
them with brandy.
So there you are my recipe for
keeping husbands busy!

ON THE
MARGIN
Plenty of
liberties, not
enough equality
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
ONE OF THE new ideas being ban-
died about by social reformers is sexual
equality. The term does not refer to
equal pay for the sexes; it concerns a
levelling out of the unequal fortunes
of individuals in the erotic sphere.
During recent years minimum wage
laws, progressive taxation, and so on
have reduced the economic differences
between people. But, as social critics
point out, these efforts to promote wel-
fare are nullified to some degree by the
persisting inequalities in amatory mat-
ters. A girl in affluent circumstances
who has no boyfriend may well con-
sider herself worse off than a girl of
lower income who has two or three.
The most advanced thinking in the
field is being done in Sweden. This
is as might be expected, since Sweden
is not only well known for its social
welfare policies but in its approach to
sexual experimentation is usually a
jump ahead of other countries. An
outspoken Swedish theorist, Dr. Lars
Ullerstam, has expounded his views
in a book entitled “The Erotic Minori-
ties” (The Grove Press, New York).
Dr. Ullerstam believes that every
government should concern itself with
sexual welfare. He advocates official
agencies to supply the needs of the
underprivileged. Among the services
he suggests is a system of mobile units,
staffed by “erotic Samaritans,” which
would visit hospitals and institutions to
minister to the inmates something-
analogous to Meals on Wheels.
In Australia the only organisation
actively concerned with problems of
this category is the Commonwealth
League for Sexual Justice. I called at
its Sydney headquarters to discuss its
activities with the secretary, Mrs
Queenie Everhope. A tall, strong-
featured woman in her forties, Mrs
Everhope stressed the need of public-
support for the League’s work.
“The erotic inequalities in the modern
w'orld are all too evident,” she said.
“At one extreme w'e have an over-
privileged few like the Rolling Stones
and Miss Kim Novak. On the other
side is a legion of have-nots and still
more numerous haven’t-enoughs. Our
organisation is trying, in a small way,
to reduce the gratification gap, as wo
call it.”
I asked Mrs. Everhope her opinion
of the theories of Dr. Ullerstam.
“He is quite well-intentioned,” she
replied, “but we regard him as too radi-
cal and off-beat. Take that scheme of
his for a government agency to arrange
meetings between persons with comple-
mentary urge patterns, such as voyeurs
and exhibitionists. I admit that voyeurs
and exhibitionists have their rights, but
they are only a small minority. The
Commonwealth League for Sexual
Justice aims to serve the wider com-
munity of the normal.”
Mrs. Everhope recalled cases where
the League had taken action.
“Our attention was directed to a
gang of boys, in a western suburb,
known as the Seven Dwarfs. They had
a communal girlfriend whom they
called Snow White. She was an attrac-
tive girl, but she was receiving more
than her fair share of male attention.
This was resented by other girls in the
district. We sent one of our field
workers to interview the Seven Dwarfs.
He convinced them of the unfairness of
the arrangement and the advantages of
having a separate girlfriend for each
of them.
“Another time we had reports of a
young man who could not persuade any
girl in Mosman to go to a drive-in with
him. He felt inadequate and unwanted.
Our investigator found it was his habit
to eat garlic sausage during the main
feature. After he was persuaded to give
up this practice, he became one of the
most sought-after escorts in the dis-
trict."
Mrs. Everhope said much of the
League's work for sexual justice was
educational. "We campaign against go-
ing steady, hold grooming classes for
wallflowers that sort of thing.
I asked whether the League favored
State intervention to help the erotically
needy, as advocated by Dr. Ullerstam.
"In general, no," she said. "A public
service of erotic Samaritans would be
open to exploitation by bogus sex-
paupers. We aim to provide romantic
opportunities for all wdthin the frame-
work of the Australian system of free
enterprise. We help the underprivileged
to help themselves - and each other.
The telephone rang. After answering
it, Mrs. Everhope said: "Excuse me, I
must dash off. There’s a case of polyg-
amy at Wollongong. That s one thing
we won’t stand for.”

Daughters of the Nile
By APRIL HERSEY
MRS. DEWEY STOLTENBERG,
of El Paso, Texas, Supreme Queen
of the Daughters of the Nile,
recently had her authority con-
firmed by 3000 women from all
parts of the United States and
Canada, who gathered at balmy,
flower-scented Honolulu for their
51st Annual Convention.
They came from Montana and
Kansas, North and South Caro-
lina, Portland, Oregon, and Boise,
Idaho. These wives, mothers, and
daughters of Shriners, those 32nd-
degree Masons, wore their regu-
lation garb —. harem pants and
they carried those objects no
middle-aged woman should be
seen without snakes, whips,
tomtoms, swords, cymbals, bells,
chalices, fans, drums, and jewel
boxes.
The various high queens, one
degree below Mrs. Dewey Stolten-
berg, were seated on kitchen chairs
camouflaged with Persian carpets
at the Honolulu International
Centre, which had, apparently, last
been used for a wrestling session;
a sign, FOUL, hovered over the
gathering.
The pageantry, to the sound of
Eastern music, seemed incredibly
complicated. Under the great circle

but every Daughter wears a crown. A small
number of Daughters come from Canada


of spotlights they steadily paraded
and arched and danced, clashed
their cymbals, bowed, and made
speeches.
Some women marched in after
the style of marching teams; some
did full seven veils presentations.
One grey-haired contortionist,
wearing lame pants and a bra,
catherine-wheeled her way across
the auditorium, finishing up
balanced on her chin before the
Great One with her poor old legs
in a terrible knot.
The individual temple queens
(there are about 130 temples in
the United States and they were
all represented, plus a few from
Canada) then approached a micro-
phone and announced the district
she represented.
There was some unpleasantness
when one woman was found to
have been fortifying herself to the
point of unsteadiness before presen-
tation and was not allowed to play.
There appeared to be very few
young ladies of the Nile and as
each temple appeared in more and
more magnificent colors and more
Left, elaborate costumes were not
entirely suitable for long rituals in
the climate of Honolulu
and more tranpsarent apparel, the
quantity of superfluous flesh would
have made a sheik blanch. One
doubts if women in their fifties
should wear jewels in their navels.
No one could doubt that these
are all very nice women, although
their symbolism could be miscon-
strued. They raise money in their
temples for charities run by the
Shriners. To some of them the visit
to Hawaii was the highlight of
their lives. All the individual
queens seem to have been sent there
on club funds and one dreads to
think of the politicking that went
on in the temples before the
Hawaiian trip.
The elaborate costumes were
very hot for Hawaii, and as the
long ritual wore on the Daughters
shed earrings, gloves, and the odd
epaulet. In the end they looked
like very tired grey-haired ladies
dressed up for a party that didn’t
ever get started.
Style of dressing varied considerably.
A jewel in the navel does not become
every middle-aged woman


For most of the
Daughters, the
trip to Hawaii
was a once-in-a-
lifetime affair

ONE MORE
WEEK
Living on The Rocks
CANBERRA’S Development Commis-
sioner, J. W. Overall, seems to have
done Sydney proud with his scheme for
the reconstruction of The Rocks and
Parliament House areas. Mr. Overall,
coming from a young city, seems a good
deal more sensitive about preserving
Sydney’s history than Sydney is.
The scheme gets right away from the
city-square idea, borrowed from 19th-
century provincial British cities, which
has been touted for a long time with-
out coming to anything, and acknow-
ledges that the central point of Sydney
is its harbor.
But even Mr. Overall cannot
undo all the wrong which has been
done. He is prepared to sweep away
the Maritime Services Board, set down
like a great fortress at the water’s edge,
to give the city Phillip Square, but
apparently nothing can be done about
the overhead railway, slung between the
water and the Quay area and spoiling
any chance of a square where a square
should naturally be.
However, any enthusiasm for Mr.
Overall’s scheme will be tempered by
the fact that at the moment it is in the
form of tiny blocks of wood and plastic,
set among sponge-rubber trees. Sydney
has seen so many splendid plans which
come to nothing. No price has been put
on this one, although there is a sug-
gested time for completion of 15 years.
Knowing the ways of Governments,
as an earnest of sincerity, and because
you have to begin somewhere, couldn’t
Cadman’s Cottage have its tin roof re-
placed, its old clothesline and oil-drum
rubbish-bin removed, and once it has
been tidied up, the 12ft.-high fence
could be removed so that Sydneysiders
could see for the first time their oldest
dwelling. Then, perhaps, we might
believe in The Rocks scheme.
Out of a hole
PERTH’S theatre-in-the-round, the
Hole-in-the-Wall, has not only increased
the demand for hyphens, but has de-
veloped into perhaps the most exciting
theatrical enterprise west of the rabbit-
proof fence. The guiding hand is Frank
Baden Powell’s, who, with fellow-actor
John Gill, now plans to move to the
“right” side of the track with a more
adequate theatre-in-the-round to be
built finished, he hopes, for the
Hole’s third birthday next June.
It was a good week also for opera:
composer James Penberthy, whose wife,
Madame Kira Bousloff, is director of
the Western Australian Ballet Com-
pany, is setting up the Western Aus-
tralian Opera Company. He plans to
have at least one season of opera per-
formed in Perth each year.
But for former Hobart director Alan
Harvey it wasn’t a good week. After
he had moved his home and family to
Perth to take over as Playhouse director
from Edgar Metcalfe beating 50
other applicants for the position he
read in the papers that his job was
vacant again. “I’m shocked by the com-
mittee’s decision,” he said. “I have not
resigned; they did not discuss the posi-
tion with me or even comment on my
work.”
Outback
A MEMBER of The Bulletin staff who
was touring the central-west of Queens-
land last week with a party of journal-
ists looking at preparations for next
month’s Royal Brisbane Show, had four
pleasant and interesting days. However,
during the whole time he met not one
woman at any official gathering, except
Mrs. David Fairbairn, wife of the Com-
monwealth Minister for National De-
velopment, who happened to be tour-
ing the district with her husband.
Our colleague feels he learnt some-
thing of how Queensland is developing,
but he remains completely mystified
about how they live up there.
Monolith
THE ORCHESTRA may have been
only an incidental in the slanging match
between the ABC and the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra’s conductor, Dean
Dixon, but concertgoers weren’t in for
any consideration at all.
The only real question which arises
from these recurring orchestral crises
is, is there any particular value in leav-
ing concert management and control of
the States’ leading orchestras in the
hands of the ABC?
Since the Sydney Opera House
squabble split up the cultural establish-
ment, the Elizabethan Opera Company
has been doing much better in opposi-
tion to the ABC than it ever did in
harness. Perhaps it might be time to
consider the advantages and disad-
vantages of slicing concerts off from
the ABC monolith.
Children's corner
GOOD DESIGN in children’s furniture
is fairly rare here, but a small shop
called Hopscotch, on Sydney’s North
Shore, is breaking new ground. It
opened two months ago and has taken
orders from all over Australia for dis-
tinctive desks, chairs, tables, beds,
slippery dips, and sandpits.
All the furniture is made from pine,
is mostly unpainted, and finished with a
sealer. Some pieces come from designer
Erak Hoglund and the Boda workshops
in Sweden; others are designed by the
owners of the shop and executed by
German-born Rina Fieck. One of these
is a pinewood slippery slide for the
under-fives, with a jungle jim incor-
porated under the slide. It is light
and easy to assemble in three pieces
and can be used inside the house.
Much of the Australian-designed fur-
niture has two functions. A fascinating
boat with a removable mast and bright
red sail, seating two or three children,
turns over, believe it or not, to become
a coffee table for adults. A bassinet has
a base which becomes a child’s rocker,
with room for four. A side table with
woven hessian shelves is a tunnel to
climb through or a mazagine holder,
and benches have lift-up seats for
storing toys.
“We want to bring back a sense of
tradition and a feeling for natural
materials in furniture and decoration,”
said Mrs. Judith Pierson, who owns
the shop with her brother-in-law and
sister, Cynthia and Jim Martin.
“Children appreciate good design as
much as adults. This furniture is strong
enough and good looking enough to be
used by future generations.”

PETER SAMUEL WRITES ON THE
ECONOMY
The breakthrough
to seasonal
statistics at last
CONGRATULATIONS to the Bureau
of Census and Statistics. At last we are
to get seasonally adjusted statistics,
something everyone who has to analyse
economic trends has been wanting for
years. The Bureau has been working
on them since the late ’sos (the Ameri-
cans started publishing them in the
’2os) and their arrival was always immi-
nent. But it never quite eventuated, not
until this week anyway.
The new statistics will make analysis
of current trends far easier and more
reliable. The Bureau has, with its usual
caution and reserve, accompanied the
publication of the new statistics with a
lengthy set of warnings about their short-
comings and the difficulties in using
them—3s full pages indeed. Simply,
the point is that seasonal patterns can
change, and no seasonal adjustment—
which adjusts raw data by factors deter-
mined on the basis of past seasons —
can at times be misleading. Thus, when
sugarcane cutting was mechanised in
Queensland, the upswing in that State’s
employment in the new year became
less pronounced and the application of
old seasonal adjustment factors would
have suggested a cyclical downswing in
the demand for labor where there was
none.
Motor vehicle registrations are diffi-
cult to adjust because of variations in
the release dates for new models. Retail
sales require not only seasonal adjust-
ment but an adjustment for variation
in trading days in a month (Fridays and
Saturdays being heavier trading days
than the rest of the week).
There are other difficulties, some of
which can be catered for, some which
cannot. But used with discretion the
new statistics will be a major contribu-
tion to economic analysis. No longer
will it be necessary for commentators to
give a current statistic reference by com-
paring it with the same month a year
earlier, a month which itself may be
subject to any variety of irrelevant influ-
ences. This is a major breakthrough
and the Bureau deserves a round of
public applause.
IT WAS A TREASURY official who
coined the phrase of the week in Can-
berra, and predictably it was at the
expense of the Department of Trade,
which had gathered a bevy of journa-
lists for an off-the-record briefing on
the final outcome of the Kennedy
Round of tariff-cutting talks in Geneva.
There it transpired that the Trade
Department had an astonishingly simple
theory about how Australia would
benefit from the new international floor
price for wheat.
By some sort of unexplained
mechanism, the higher minimum price
would somehow lift the whole struc-
ture of wheat prices traced out over
the years in its familiar cyclical
pattern. “This is a sort of Hovercraft
theory,” said an incredulous Treasury
man, and people quickly agreed that
if this was the only basis for the
Department of Trade’s claim that Aus-
tralia is $24 million to $4B million
better off as a result of the Wheat
Agreement, then we might as well
forget about it.
“Hot air,” quipped some.
Trade Department people are now
tending to speak of the lower $24
million figure, in an attempt to back-
track from their Minister’s more extra-
vagant claim on his return from Geneva.
There are now other doubts. Mr.
McEwen had said that the new agree-
ment would not only establish the floor
at a higher level but would establish
a floor that was really firm. A U.S.
Department of Agriculture comment
contradicts this, saying that the Agree-
ment only provides for “consultations”
among exporters who are tempted to
cut their prices below the floor to make
a sale. If these consultations do not
succeed, “sales below minimum prices
in the Agreement schedule could
occur.”
One good piece of news is that Trade
Department officials are hopeful of
being able to revive the scheme for
selling off-season beef to the EEC.
After it had been initialled by the
Council of Ministers, the French Gov-
eminent caved in to the pressure of
local farmers and refused to go through
with it. After elections in France it f s
said, De Gaulle’s officials will be free
to reconsider the matter. Which was
the reason $25 million of imported
items were asterisked in a schedule of
tariff changes in which Australia i s
making as its part of the Kennedy
Round.
The changes to be introduced over
four years affect about five percent of
our imports. Duties covering $9O
million (2 percent of our trade) are to
be reduced, but all are small reductions
which have the effect of putting Jap.
anese, European, and American ex-
porters on the same competitive foot-
ing as British producers. Trade of
about $45 million gets higher tariffs
and again the main aim is to divert
export sales from British to non-British
sellers.
Otherwise the exercise consisted of
removing a number of “primage duties,”
tariff surcharges which have lingered
on from the depression of the 19305.
As Mr. McEwen said in his Press
statement, “Care had been taken to
avoid impairing the effectiveness of
protection for Australian industry.”
THERE ARE NOT many import re-
strictions likely to gain public support.
They are a particularly rigid and cosily
protective device at the best of times.
But import restrictions on aluminium,
as recommended by the Tariff Board
and accepted by the Government last
week, make a great deal of sense. The
major fabricator, Alcan Australia, is a
subsidiary of the giant Canadian Alcan
and it said in the Tariff Board hear-
ings that, whatever price Australian
producers were able to supply un-
wrought metal, it would prefer to buy
its metal from its parent company in
Canada.
It happens that the aluminium in-
dustry is one of our lowest-cost indus-
tries. Our bauxite deposits, as well as
being the largest in the world, are also
some of the cheapest, although our
aluminium smelters are small by world
standards they are able to produce at
very gompetitive prices. Helped to
expa,nd their capacity and develop
large-scale plants, our aluminium in-
dustry should be able to develop into
a major export earner. And in doing
this it should not be held back by the
internal marketing arrangements of a
large international company.

Holt's ups and
downs in
political yo-yo
By ALAN REID
DEMOCRATIC POLITICS is a bit
like playing yo-yo. You have your ups
and downs. At the moment the Holt
administration appears to be on the
downward movement.
Prime Minister Holt’s recent over-
seas trip was basically unsuccess-
ful. Holt himself, as always, made a
good personal impression. Fie has a re-
freshing honesty and a directness in
stating his and Australia’s viewpoint
that undoubtedly appeal to people
accustomed to double-talking and
evasion.
He had some minor successes, and
one that would be regarded as major
were it not dwarfed by his failure in
the mission he regarded as all-import-
ant to persuade Britain to postpone
indefinitely its withdrawal from Singa-
pore and Malaysia.
In his talks with President Johnson
at Camp David, Holt detailed frankly
Australia’s finance difficulties arising
from purchase of United States military
equipment, Australia’s capital needs if
it were to strengthen itself develop-
mentally as the U.S. Pacific flank, and
the disproportion between Australian
consumption of U.S. goods and U.S.
consumption of Australian products.
Johnson called in his administrative
chieftains, and gave a directive that
Australia’s problems should be con-
sidered sympathetically, and the
administration should, in fact, do every-
thing possible to help Australia.
Directives like this do not produce
concrete results immediately. But gener-
ally they set a tone which produces
results over a period.
But on the crucial question of British
withdrawal from Singapore and Mal-
aysia Holt got precisely nowhere. He
managed to extract only assurances.
One was that Britain would maintain
a shadow presence, through arrange-
ments to dispatch mobile forces to the
area, in an emergency, once it was out
of its Singapore and Malaysia bases.
And he secured a high-level recognition
of the need for Britain to announce its
withdrawal plans in a sufficiently am-
biguous and tentative way to permit
second thoughts in the event of a
change in the South-East Asian situation
before withdrawal is finally completed.
(It still has to be seen whether the
British statement, expected this week,
is as ambiguous and tentative as both
Holt and Johnson hope it will be.)
On the local side, Holt and his
administration have also had their set-
backs. 1
There is evidence to suggest that in-
dustrial restlessness from which Aus-
tralia has, comparatively speaking, been
relatively free is on the upsurge.
There is evidence that the Communist
Party, working through its ALP associ-
ates, particularly in Victoria, has in-
tensified its activities in the industrial
field. But the restlessness seems to go
deeper than political manipulation.
The ACTU is showing signs of hos-
tility, although over recent years there
has been a tendency for it to adopt
a non-political attitude, despite its
nominal association with the ALP.
(This tendency to a non-aligned politi-
cal attitude is the subject of a secret,
as yet unpublished, and highly critical
analysis of the relations between the
ACTU and the Labor Party submitted
by the former Opposition Leader Mr.
Arthur Calwell to the ALP Federal
Executive after the Labor debacle at
the last General Elections.)
Holt was seriously embarrassed by an
uncontrollable Senate which cost him
the PMG rises during the last parli-
amentary session. In the coming-
parliamentary session he has to face a
Senate likely to be even less prone to
accept discipline, after overwhelming-
public rejection of the referendum to
break the constitutional nexus between
Holt... a temporary downturn?
the numbers of senators and member-
ship of the House of Representatives
Relationships between the Liberals
generally and the Country Party are
undoubtedly strained and will continue
to be strained, with each trying to
stand aloof from and score advantages
over the other, until the vexed ques-
tion of electoral redistribution, with a
weighting of electorates in favor of the
rural vote, is finally decided.
Even on the negative side the
state of the Labor Party organisation-
ally things have not broken Holt’s
way.
Confronted with the obstinacy of
ALP Western Australian secretary Mr.
F. E. (“Joe”) Chamberlain, for years
federally the ALP’s “strong man” and
the dominating figure in the W.A. ALP,
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam'
appealed over Chamberlain’s head to
the W.A. rank and file. Whitlam urged
on them the need for reorganisation of
the ALP’s bureaucratically dominated
organisational structure which he con-
cedes is unfit to manage the affairs of
a party aspiring to govern the Common-
wealth.
Whitlam did not get what he wanted
—endorsement of the need for reorg-
anisation but he got a foot through
the door. He prevented the W.A.
machinery controllers from having the
proposition that reorganisation was
necessary thrown unceremoniously out
the window.
Whitlam admittedly failed in Victoria,
where he tried the same tactic of try-
ing to appeal over the head of the
anti-reform Victorian ALP Executive
to the Victorian ALP rank and file.
But his failure was understandable. His
experience confirms a theory that I
have held for a long time that the
Victorian ALP is a facade and consists
of an executive without a rank and
file.
For Holt it has not been a particu-
larly good parliamentary recess. A
practical politician, he is clearly philo-
sophical about the fact that at this
time he is on the downturn. He is
sufficiently long in the tooth to know
that in politics you sometimes go up
and sometimes you go down.
He is probably comforted by another
thing. Once the position in Australian
politics was that a government’s stocks
usually tended to rise during a parlia-
mentary recess and to decline during
parliamentary sessions when the Gov-
ernment was subject to parliamentary
attack.
Over recent years, this pattern has
tended to be reversed.
It is during parliamentary sessions
that the splits and divisions within the
Labor Party have usually been paraded
publicly to Labor’s electoral disadvant-
age.
It will be interesting to see whether
this is the position during the coming
parliamentary session or whether Holt’s
difficulties, including the activities of a
rebellious Senate heartened by the re-
cent referendum decision, tend to over-
shadow and so make less publicly obvi-
ous Labor’s internal woes.


AUSTRALIA
How far do the Australians
go in Vietnam?
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION be-
tween the Americans and the Austra-
lians about what the Australian role
should be in Vietnam had been lying
beneath the surface for 12 months or
more. Last week they began to come
out into the open when, in Washington,
Defence Secretary McNamara said:
“We must use more effectively the per-
sonnel that are presently there, and
when I say that I am speaking of all
Free World personnel.”
This was taken in Canberra to mean,
in part at least, that Australian and
South Korean troops should be taken off
their present task of pacification and
put into more frequent action against
Australians... ready for a new role?
main force Communist units. This
would fit in with the general theme
of American strategy, which is that
pacification is the primary role for the
Vietnamese Army and that Allied
troops should concentrate on destroying
or neutralising the 120,000 North Viet-
namese and Viet Cong regulars who
constitute the major and most immedi-
ate military problem.
In December last year the Americans
said specifically they would like to see
our troops shifted to “1 Corps,” the
area which takes in the five northern-
most provinces of South Vietnam. This
is where the Communists have been
concentrating the major part of their
military strength and where U.S.
Marines have been taking very severe
casualties. Undoubtedly, they are even
keener now to get our support up there.
Both in Canberra Lfld in Vietnam
our people were keen to continue with
slow but careful and effective pacifica-
tion in Phuoc Tuy. Large joint opera-
tions such as the current Operation
Paddington against the 274th Regiment
of sth VC Division were welcomed in
Phuoc Tuy, as they were important to
the strategy of keeping guerillas isolated
from main force support. But that is
about as far as our people wanted to go.
Australian military men often said
they thought it was a mistake to leave
pacification entirely to the Vietnamese
Army as the Americans wish. They said
that in pacification and in large opera-
tions, combined Vietnamese and Allied
units worked best.
Though 90 percent of the people of
Phuoc Tuy province now have reason-
able security as a result of Australian
efforts there, a lot remained to be done.
Our preference was to work
more closely with the Vietnamese in
improving security and fighting the
“other war,” supporting the Revolution-
ary Development teams now moving
into the countryside of Phuoc Tuy and
expanding civic action there as military
security improved. There might be
periodic expansions of the “tactical area
of responsibility,” but no major change
in locale.
Australian thinking was that the
Vietnam war would be won only by
rooting the Viet Cong “infrastructure”
out of the villages and giving self-
...or to continue the job in Phuoc Tuy?
responsibility to village life. Fighting
main force Viet Cong and North Viet-
namese units did not get to the basis of
the Vietnam problem, wdrich was the
infiltration and partial collapse of its
social fabric. A “victory” in which the
North Vietnam forces retired and the
the Americans pulled out most of their
strength would be in fact a defeat in
which the Viet Cong “infrastructure” in
the villages, undestroyed, would con-
tinue its work and win the final victory.
ALP Conference
No walkover
By DON BUDGE
A SHOTGUN WEDDING was solem-
nised in Perth last week between Gough
Whitlam, leader of the Australian
Labor Party, and Joe Chamberlain, its
strongman. The W.A. State ALP con-
ference that witnessed and cheered the
event combined a Kremlin-like flair for
rationalising with Hollywood ballyhoo
over the non-event of the year. For
an act it was, the so-called settlement
of differences between two incompatible
Labor viewpoints.
Holding the shotgun were men of the
Trades and Labor Council, for the
meeting was brought about by men
who threatened to withdraw union
backing for the Party unless the show
went on. As TLC president Mr. Don
Cooley says: “We told them that the
Labor movement depended on trade
unions for support. The unions set up
the Party to give us a firm and united
policy. When the leaders are at odds,
there’s disunity throughout the Party.”
After Mr. Whitlam had written to
say he would not communicate with Mr.
Chamberlain until he had received an
apology for criticism against him, the
TLC wrote back to say they would
take none of this petulance; instead of
policies, Labor people were wallowing
in the wake of the pride and impetu-
ousness of these two men.
But even the best-run weddings have
their gate-crashers, and this time the
grab for glory was made by the State
ALP president, Mr. Col Jamieson, who
appointed himself MC (and implied
he was Cupid as well) when he
announced to the cheering throng: “I
am happy to inform the conference that
any differences that existed have now
been resolved.”
Out of it, the two central figures got
what they wanted. Mr. Whitlam gained
a facade of prestige; Mr. Chamberlain
proved again that he is willing to com-
promise on prestige so long as he is


left the chance to win on policy. And
despite apparent rebuffs of the Cham-
berlain line at the conference, the real
battles are yet to be fought—at the
Adelaide Federal conference, starting
July 31.
There are two main areas —foreign
policy and plans for Party reorganisa-
tion. And it would seem that the ALP
old line will survive through Adelaide.
A radical Boilermakers’ Society
motion, calling for Australian with-
drawal from military alliances with
the U.S., was rejected after Mr. Kim
Beazley had said: “I do not want to see
the Labor Party have a foreign policy
where we whinge at those we know will
not attack us, like the United States,
and cringe at those we think might.”
However, a State executive motion
came forward to be noted, without
endorsement, reaffirming the old line
on foreign affairs. Significantly, another
motion committed all members to be
loyal to decisions of conferences
and this was seen as an implied threat
not to seek revision of the anti-Vietnam
policy in Adelaide.
Only in Adelaide will Labor be able
to decide the real outcome of the moves
on Whitlam-Wyndham reforms. Cham-
berlain fought hard last week to
retain the status quo, claiming it would
be ludicrous to continue public wrang-
ling. The executive’s senior vice-presi-
dent, Mr. Joe Berinson, moved success-
fully for another look to be taken at the
Federal structure of the Party.
Still, there is enough ambiguity left
in how this is to be done to allow
plenty of room to manoeuvre in
Adelaide. It could be that Mr.
Chamberlain, always a realist, is simply
playing for time. He is 67 and at last
week’s conference accepted the pay rise
to $l5O a week that he had previously
refused as a matter of principle, because
he opposed parliamentarians increasing
their salaries. This matter of principle
cost him $2692 . . . which now goes
into his retirement allowance.
“Joe” Chamberlain... compromise on
prestige
Air
The Jaguar strike
SINCE 1960 AUSTRALIA has become
one of the world’s big importers of
military and civil aircraft. In military
buying we began when the Mirage
111-0 was chosen to replace the Sabre
as Australia’s front-line fighter. More
than 100 Mirages were ordered from the
Government Aircraft Factories, who
are licensed to build the aircraft in
Australia. That was a $2OO million order,
and so, originally, was the purchase of
24 F-111C fighter-bombers, due in 1968.
Then there was an order for ten Lock-
heed Orions ($57 million) to replace
the Neptune Maritime Recce aircraft.
And the purchase of 108 Macchi MB-
-326H jet trainers; the BAC 111 VIP
jets; the ten HS 748 twin turboprop
navigation trainers and VIP carriers;
the Caribou transports; a dozen new
Hercules C 130 E transports; three
Mystere 20 VIP mini-jets; and so on.
Now there’s the possibility of another
$lOO million order. An Anglo-French
consortium has been trying hard to in-
terest the RAAF in the Jaguar tactical
strike fighter and supersonic trainer.
The French-designed (but British re-
fined) and British engined Jaguar would
fill a coming need for supersonic pilot
training in the RAAF of the 19705.
The strike version could come into
effect in the early 1970 s to replace the
by then aging Sabres.
British Aircraft Corporation and
Breguet (France) are the two companies
concerned. They have had their sales
managers in Australia to start promot-
ing the deal, and they have offered
attractive terms. Unit cost of the Jaguar
would be around £500,000 sterling,
making it an inexpensive aircraft for
its one-and-a-half times the speed of
sound capability.
And if Australia is interested the
consortium would be happy for this
country to do some of the research and
development of the aircraft, as well as
local manufacture. This is in an effort
to keep the local industry happy. The
Jaguar would be selling in competition
with an Australian-designed supersonic
trainer designed by Commonwealth
Aircraft Corporation of Melbourne.
The Jaguar is going to come in five
versions, and with a triple role. The
three tasks are (1) tactical ground
attack in close support of the army;
(2) advanced trainer; (3) carrier-borne
light strike aircraft.
Two RAF versions are doubtless the
ones the RAAF would be interested in
a two-seat trainer and single-seat
ground attack aircraft. The Royal Air
Force probably will order about 150 of
the strike version for delivery after
1973. The aircraft will roll off British
and French production lines simul-
taneously, and, while the airframe will
An RAF Jaguar ... strike version
be more of French design than British,
the engine proportions will be reversed.
The cost of Australian orders if
the RAAF was to take both strike and
trainer versions could escalate be-
yond the $lOO million, as more orders
were placed. It is suggested that Aus-
tralia could sell the locally built pro-
duct to New Zealand and thus recoup
some of its tooling and research costs.
With a ferry range of nearly 3000 miles,
the Jaguar would be well able to fly the
Tasman.
As a front-line troop support aircraft,
it would naturally be able to fly from
roughly prepared airstrips. The only
other consideration is the Australian tax-
payer; after all, last financial year
each man, woman, and child shelled
out about $7 each on new aircraft. And
by the time the 24 F-lllCs are paid for
each of us will own $2O worth. A lot
for a small country.
Still, the Vietnam and Middle East
wars have proved the value of modern
technology in localised conflict. With-
out air superiority the Israel-UAR war
would have lasted considerably longer.
With Mirage fighters protecting the
strike fighters, the Israeli Air Force
was able to cripple Egypt’s Air Force
in hours.
National parks
Fire and water
FAUNA AND FLORA protectionists in
both Victoria and Tasmania were fight-
ing rearguard actions last week. In
north-eastern Victoria they claimed that
the Forest Commission’s “controlled
burning,” which it plans to perform
once every five years to lower the bush-
fire risk, was killing-off many bush
animals, reducing much of the habitat
to ashes, destroying wildflowers and rare


orchids over large tracts, and paving
the way for erosion on ranges such as
the Buranduda, with its Indigo Falls,
which they would like to see declared
a national park.
Said the protectionists, “The forests,
fauna, and flora are the heritage of the
Australian people and should not be
destroyed by a misguided section of the
Forest Commission.” The Commission
gave the normal bureaucratic reply:
“We know that what we are doing is
right.”
Similarly, the Tasmanian Hydro Elec-
tric Commission knows it is doing right
in “modifying” Lake Pedder National
Park • —.60,000 acres in the northwvest
of the State, declared a nature and
scenic reserve in 1955. The main modi-
fication is to be a $3OO million scheme
to channel the Cordon River into Tas-
mania’s hydro-electric scheme, making
Lake Pedder 100 square miles in area,
holding 43 times the volume of water
in Sydney Harbor.
The HEC is sacred to Government
in Tasmania. Deputy Premier Fagan
told the Legislative Assembly that if
the HEC’s plan was altered the cost of
the Gordon River Scheme would rise
by $l7 million, power output would
Premier Reece ... tourist attraction
drop by 40 percent, the cost of elec-
tricity generated would climb from .38c
to ,47c a kilowatt hour, and capitalised
value lost would be $l4 million.
A dialogue between Premier Reece
and protesting organisations followed:
few people have even seen Lake Pedder
ten years ago few had seen Ayers
Rock: the HEC plans are urgent and
must not be delayed why weren’t the
people told of them years ago: the
immense lake will be a great tourist
attraction are you planning ferries
and an Opera House on it?
The protesters recalled that previous
power schemes had created mud flats;
water from Launceston Gorge had be-
come a mere trickle, Lake St. Claire
had been so affected that the “Shannon
Rise” is now merely a memory for
anglers.
Last week Sir Edmund Hillary
pleaded for preservation of “the button-
grass plains and their surrounding
mountains,” and the World Wild Life
Fund, London, cabled Premier Reece
condemning the destroying of national

parks through industrial development or

The Tasmanian Government seems
to have a bigger fight on its hands, so
far, than the Victorian Forest Commis-
sion but all protectionists have
powerful friends and ways of making
their protests ring loud and long.
Food, aid
India's crisis
INDIA IS DEPENDING on the Aus-
tralian Cabinet to relieve a crucial
shortage of food grains in August and
September.
So said Mr. A. L. Dias, head of
the Ministry of Food and Agriculture,
in a Press conference in the strange
Tyrolean-style house of the Indian High
Commission in Canberra.
He spoke slowly, weighing his words
very cautiously, but the sum total of
what he said amounted to an unpre-
cedented plea for generous, rapid assist-
ance.
A second successive year of drought
has left India again 12 million tons
short of the already inadequate 89 mil-
lion tons planned production of food
grains of 1965. The Americans have, as
usual, given generously, but this year
on condition that other nations match
their contribution. And the problem of
August and September is that grains
already ordered are not going to arrive.
The Suez Canal blockage has held up
shipments from the U.S. and made
shipping scarce, and, in addition, Burma
is unable to fulfil contracts to supply
rice.
“There are no ships in America even
if there is the grain for us, so we are
depending on Australia,” Mr. Dias said
so quietly that a number of journalists
missed it.
Cabinet this week will consider the
request, which Mr. Dias put to Prime
Minister Holt.
Dias also spent time with an inter-
departmental committee on food aid.
He gave them detailed papers on the
Indian food position and the measures
the Indian Government has taken.
He went out of his way to give an
assurance that this is an emergency
request and that it wall not be repeated
year by year. The Indian Government
is now paying the price for past cries
of “wolf.” Its friends in the West have
so long appealed for aid to India in
terms of the country’s chronic food
shortage that, now, when there is a real
crisis, it is less easily recognised.
Mr. Dias told journalists that he
expected the next harvest to be a
record. This year the monsoon has
arrived in full force, and crops are off
to an excellent start. “If we get the
normal follow-up rains we can expect
a crop of 95 million tons,” he said.

No Banker's Clerk

A Hippopotamus.
‘lf this should stay to dine,’ he said,
'There won t be much for us’.”
Not only those as innocent as children
and logicians have something to learn
from the verses of Lewis Carroll.
Two years ago a Labor team led
by Jack McCormack, Les Stuart, and
Mick O’Neill won control of the Mel-
bourne branch of the Waterside Work-
ers' Federation from the Communists
and their ALP unity-ticket supporters,
With McCormack as president,
Stuart as secretary, and O’Neill as
assistant secretary, the Melbourne
waterfront had two years of relative
industrial peace, there were no political
strikes and industrial trouble was dealt
with as a problem to be solved and not
as an excuse to demonstrate the non-
existent militancy of the Australian
proletariat.
But there have been problems. Les
Stuart did not enjoy the best of health,
and whilst he continued to display
strong fighting qualities on the open
platform, he did not display the tem-
perament or talents of an adminis-
trator.
There has been opposition on the
Melbourne waterfront to the recom-
mendations of the Woodward National
Stevedoring Industry Conference. Last
month Melbourne waterside workers, at
a noisy meeting in Festival Hall, voted
1134 to 97 against the Woodward pro-
posals. The Melbourne workers have
been earning bigger money than those
in other centres and they are suspicious
of the minimum pay which will be part
of the system of permanent waterside
employment. Many think that this may
become, in practice, an average or even
a maximum.


In the face of these problems the
various factions in Melbourne worked
out some curious deals in the recent
c'lections. The five major factions were
Fitzgibbon Labor, Progressive Labor,
anti-Woodward Communists and unity-
ticket ALP, the DTP, and the Peking
Coipmunists.
The first tw 7 o groups support most of
the Woodward proposals, most members
of the last three groups are at this
stage opposed to accepting them. In
the election all of the groups except
the DLP won positions. The most im-
portant changes were presidency to a
Left-wing member of the Victorian
ALP executive, and Les Stuart’s loss
to Peking-liner Ted Bull. And wdien
the strikes begin rolling all will find that
Ted Bull is no Banker’s Clerk.
Canberra
Sydney link
SYDNEY’S ROCKS REPORT, with its
vision splendid, has created its own
problems in Canberra’s temples of
bureaucracy.
Not the least of these is the fact that
one man, himself a member of the
bureaucratic fraternity, has shown that
divested of red tape he can accomplish
in three months (his original predic-
tion) less three days what would have
taken months under the Canberra
system.
National Capital Development Com-
missioner Mr. J. W. Overall, the
guardian of Canberra’s planned growth,
first visited The Rocks area early in
April. After walking the byways and
stairways of The Rocks, he told a Press
conference he would submit a plan in
three months’ time.
The Rocks report, with massive Press
coverage, burst across the breakfast
tables last Friday week. Initial reaction
—always the most important in these
things was good, and, more import-
antly, the plan received the editorial
blessing of the Sydney Press. Mr. Over-
all has set the pace, and it is now up
to the N.S.W. State Government to
match it.
No one was yelling, “Author, author,”
W'hen the plan became public property
last week. Just as well, as N.S.W. State
authorities, worried about Canberra
siphoning off some of the kudos in some
mysterious manner, had specifically-
requested the National Capital Develop-
ment Commission, and Mr. Overall in
particular, to keep in the background.
Ironically, Canberra will still benefit
—from the flow 7 back of realisation in
Sydney that the national capital’s de-
velopment is in excellent hands and,
should the State Government proceed
with the Overall plan, that for evermore
Sydney will have a tangible link w 7 ith
the bush capital.
Melbourne
Sewage in the bay
PORT PHILLIP BAY may not be the
loveliest aquatic playground in the
world, but boats sail on it, fish feed in
it, and people swim in it. Furthermore,
it is the only bay Melbourne has.
And now 7 the Board of Works pro-
poses to run sewage effluent into the
bay.
By 29 votes to 21 the Board pro-
poses to establish a $l2O million sew 7 age
disposal scheme to relieve the strain on
the over-burdened Werribee system. The
first part of the new scheme will tap
half of the 100 million gallons a day
now 7 handled by Werribee. It involves
the construction of a south-eastern pip-
ing and pumping system, a $3O million
purification plant, and a tw 7 0-mile out-
fall pipeline into Port Phillip Bay near
Carrum.
The Carrum outfall is to be “tempor-
J. W. Overall... background, Rocks
ary” to last for about ten years. The
next stage will involve the piping of
the effluent into the waters of Bass
Strait at Cape Schanack.
“Temporary? That’s what they say
now,” the Mayor of Chelsea told The
Bulletin. “But we all know in this towm
that what starts out as temporary has a
habit of becoming permanent. Especi-
ally public works.”
Carrum is in the city of Chelsea, and
the Mayor said, “The whole thing is
scandalous. Why do they have to let
their effluent loose in highly populated
areas with high property values? Why-
do they have to use the bay, anyway?
Why not use Westernport, where there
are wide openings to the ocean?”
The Mayor of Chelsea assured us
that all the Mayors of the Bayside
suburbs from Mornington to St. Kilda,
and most of their citizens, would oppose
the scheme and that the Government
would not dare accept the Board of
Works’ decision.
The Bulletin asked the Mayor if he
thought there might be health risks for
bay swimmers. The reply was: “They
say it is all treated and made safe, and
I suppose it usually is, but no plan is
infallible. The sewage plant only needs
to break down once and disease could
spread.”
But the Professor of Civil Engineer-
ing at Melbourne University was not
so sure. “If the sewage is properly
treated,” he said, “there should not be
any worries. The matter will not carry
disease. It will be inert. In England
a lot of sewage is emptied into the
streams after treatment and there are
no health problems.”
Asked if he would be happy to
swim in the waters of Carrum when
the effluent begins to mix with the
brine, he replied, without hesitation:
“Yes, of course. So long as the sewage
is properly treated.”
In the propaganda battle raging last
week, the Board of Works came up with
something better than the ordeal by
swimming. It held a cocktail party to
celebrate its new scheme. The chief
drink of the afternoon was purified
sewage effluent, which the Board’s
Commissioners sipped for the benefit
of Press and public.
Sport
"Mr. Soccer" quits
SOCCER’S GREATEST ENTHU-
SIAST in Australia, Giacomo or “Big
Jim” Bayutti, decided this month to give
it up “for good”; which, in his lan-
guage, may range from a month to a
year. Bayutti, Australia’s “Mr. Soccer,”
was vice-president of both the Aus-
tralian and N.S.W. Soccer Federations.
Ostensibly, he resigned because of
business and health reasons. The pros-
perous construction and excavation firm,
which he has built up since his arrival
from northern Italy in November,
1949, needed his attention. So did his
health, he said. So did his family.
Years ago he helped found todays
successful APIA club, a direct descen-
dant of the once legendary Leichhardt-
Annandale. Just when the club began
its climb toward our Soccer elite, he
quit. The challenge was gone.
He also helped establish APIAs
social club, at Leichhardt, in Sydney,
easily the most sumptuous and profit-
able club associated with Soccer. But
before the roof was on, Bayutti had
departed.
In the past few years he worked
for Soccer at the highest level and be-
came one of Australia’s top administra-
tors. During his overseas trips, at least
twice a year and always at his own
expense, he was a most vociferous am-
bassador for his country.

Congress in London, he fought for the
formation of the Oceania Soccer Con-
federation. Initially, most delegates
from the Soccer countries of Europe
and South America were indifferent to
his ideas; where was Australia and
what is Oceania, anyway?
Bayutti quickly told them, in his
heavily accented yet fiery English, and
returned to Sydney with a unanimous
vote behind him.
It is doubtful Australian Soccer ever
had a more colorful and controversial
character. Equally on good terms with
European aristocrats and his own con-
struction workers, Bayutti can be a
charmer, a polished, urbane, and witty
raconteur.
However, his Latin flair for the over-
statement has often landed him in
trouble. Bayutti is an avant-gardist, even
a visionary. While others are apt to
think and plan in club terms, Bayutti’s
dreams go beyond Australia.
During his years at the top of Aus-
tralia’s Soccer heap, he often came into
bitter conflict with local and inter-
state officialdom, which either didn’t
appreciate his ways or misunderstood
his motives.
Eventually, the old fable turned sour:
wolf grew tired of the howling flock
around him and, once again, quit. But
those who know him well enough are
certain that Bayutti will be back in a
sport which is not rich enough to do
without his considerable talents.
New Zealand
The container age
THE PACESETTER for overseas con-
tainer shipping in New Zealand is the
Auckland Harbor Board, whose chair-
man, Reg Savory, and general manager,
Bob Lorimer, have visited Australia, the
U.S.A., Britain, Europe, and Japan
talking to container operators and
attending conferences on cargo hand-
ling. Next week the board is holding a
symposium on the container system. The
guest speaker will be Australia’s Secre-
tary of the Department of Trade, Sir
Alan Westerman.
On their recent return from overseas
both Savory and Lorimer spoke frankly
to a New Zealand suddenly aware that
a new day was coming in world com-
merce. Lorimer said, “The container is
the natural response to the inevitable
escalation of sea-freight charges which
have been this country’s lot for many
years. Four or five container ships would
be capable of lifting more than 40 per-
cent of New Zealand’s overseas cargoes,
reducing turnaround on the New Zea-
land coast from the present average to
2£ days, with five round voyages
“Jim” Bayutti ... Soccer’s visionary
a year on the U.K. to New Zealand run
instead of two.”
And Savory said it was forecast that
80 percent of the world’s merchandise
would be carried by container ships by
the 1980 s; Britain had ordered six of
these ships for £3O million sterling,
Japan would build 35 for Pacific trade,
and Farrell Lines of New York were
building for Pacific trade, too.
He outlined the economic study and
technical research necessary for the
changeover in N.Z.
Auckland will have a flying start over
other New Zealand ports when its pre-
sent $lO million (N.Z.) project is com-
pleted, probably by 1970, with a roll-
on-off berth, a conventional berth, and
an international container quay. The
latter will be 1375 ft. long and 60ft.
wide, with a 36ft. water depth. Adjoin-
ing it will be 13 acres of land to meet
the overseas concept of one to 1J acres
for each 100 ft. of berthage. Beyond
this, a total of 58 acres for cargo
assembly.
Meanwhile, the shipping lines which
have been trading between Britain and
New Zealand for many years have new
tonnage built or on order. These ships
are conventional, but will carry a num-
ber of containers, also. Ships of the
Colombus Line, New York, this year
have brought some container cargoes to
New Zealand on a trial basis. This
company and the MANZ Line, which
also operates between New Zealand and
America’s Atlantic coast, has offered,
since April, a 10 percent freight cut for
all cargoes shipped in containers and
unit loads.
The capital, Wellington, and the
South Island ports of Lyttelton and
Dunedin are planning for roll-on-off
and pallet shipping. The Union Steam-
ship Co. has ordered two roll-on-off
ships built in Scotland for $5 million
to replace six now in the trans-Tasman
trade, and these will use the above three
ports on the run between New Zealand
and Australia from about the end o
this year.

COMMENT
The dairy farmers are not
selfish villains
OUR COVER STORY this week on the Australian dairying industry
goes beyond the universal truths usually put up for or against the industry
and attempts instead to look for the individual problems of dairy farmers.
Of these, the greatest is that something like 40 percent of them may be
in the depressed class. Their problems are not likely to be solved by an
overall commodity subsidy or, indeed, by any overall industry approach.
They are best looked at in detail, depressed area by depressed area.
Assistance to increase efficiency or to enlarge holdings or to get out of
dairying altogether, or whatever it is that individual situations seem to
demand, is best given according to the realities of individual areas. This
seems a better way to spend the money now going into subsidies: it means
that, at some time in the future, expenditure on helping the dairy industry
can cease or almost cease.
Butter, the industry’s other major problem, is a different matter. So
far as the domestic market is concerned there is no good reason why, if
margarine is niade entirely of Australian materials, it should not be on
sale as freely as anything else. We may choose to pay special attention
to farmers in general, but not, surely, to foster one kind of farmer
against the other. If, according to an agreed timetable, margarine quotas
were increased and finally abolished, it would then be up to the butter
industry to meet this competition by ordinary marketing methods, as any
other industry has to meet its competition. So far as the export market
is concerned, it seems inevitable that the overseas market for butter will
continue to decline, and since earnings from exports are a matter of
general interest to us all, this is a matter in which government assistance
can be entirely in order. But one thing should be recognised: if we can’t
sell butter overseas we have to sell something else. Preferably other milk
products. But if we can’t sell enough milk products to keep all the dairy
industry going, then parts of it will have to turn to something else
vealers, for example. It is impossible to see how the butter industry can
keep going at its present rate. The sooner members of the industry
consider this the better.
To recognise that the dairy industry has problems is not to recognise
that dairy farmers are selfish villains. Many of them work harder than
most of the rest of the community and get less reward for their labors.
Nor should we go on condemning the industry as uniquely inefficient.
If the depressed areas are excluded, the rest of the industry would seem
efficient, given Australian conditions, but it may sometimes be a little
timid in proclaiming its efficiencies, since they point to the absurdities of
a system of overall assistance. Nor should we be alarmed that there is
some assistance to the industry. Most dairy industries are assisted by their
governments. Here our concern should be to use assistance selectively so
that assistance can later come to an end.
It is even worse to see the industry as if it were one single thing with
one single problem. This fault characterises approaches to the rural
industries generally and confuses much of the discussion about them. For
instance, the wool industry, so much more important to us than dairying,
is now also being treated in the same way. The Government provides a
subsidy on superphosphate, which is fair enough, since our basic export
industry merits some recompense for the fact that it cannot put up its
prices to recover the rising costs of our contrived economy, but a subsidy
is no use to those wool farmers in the more arid regions who are not con-
cerned with superphosphate. A rail-freight concession would have meant
more to them.
It is time that we made a feasibility study of Australia’s pastoral and
agricultural industries so that we might have detailed ideas of the eco-
nomic possibilities in each area related to soil, climate, natural disasters,
land title, size of holdings, distance from market, and so forth. More
sensible policies would then be made possible, going beyond the present
addiction to convention or hit-or-miss. Combined with greater use of
extension services and a more flexible method of rural credit, a more indi-
vidual approach could be made to the problems of the rural industries.
This would not save the industries from market changes (although trend
forecasts of markets could help forward planning). But it would mean
that reactions to market changes could make more sense.


Must we
butter up the
dairy
farmers?
THE HARDER YOU LOOK at the
dairy industry the harder it is to make
up your mind about it.
Exports, for instance. According to
one point of view the prospect for at
least 40 percent of Australia’s 60,000
dairy farmers might be that by 1980
they will no longer be needed, because
the industry has been built around the
production of butter, including butter
for export, and prospects for butter
exports are fearsome.
This view is based on the most com-
prehensive survey yet done—at Monash
University on behalf of the American
Department of Agriculture. According
to this survey, exports of butter, which
were running at 90,000 tons a year,
will be. down to 76,000 tons by 1970,
68,000 tons by 1975, and 53,000 tons
by 1980. This forecast does not allow
for Britain going into the Common
Market. If that happened, since Britain
is our main outlet, the fall-off would
be even stiffer.
This is the pessimistic view. The
optimists look to new markets for pro-
cessed milk in Asia. They say that if
consumption in Japan, Thailand,
Malaysia, and the Philippines could
be increased from one-sixth of a pint
daily to one-third of a pint, then the
entire Australian milk output would
be barely sufficient to meet the demand.
On the home market there is gloom
among those who contemplate the for-
ward march of margarine, but others
believe that if margarine is made from
Australian oilseeds (this is the only
politically possible avenue for the
easing of quotas) then it will not
take the Australian oilseed growers long
to get as well organised as dairy farmers
and put up price demands that will
not be based on their costs but what
the market will bear.
In addition, the optimists see a con-
tinuing and increasing demand for all
kinds of cheeses, ice-cream, sweet
cream, and so on. They also see a
sideline in increased raising of vealer
calves if the current Meat Board drive
to lift home consumption succeeds, and
in the protest that if Australians were
prepared to pay for premium-grade
meats, intensive - system beef - raising
could become profitable.
Examination of the industry’s effi-
ciency provides equal paradoxes. That
there are inefficient areas is beyond
doubt, but the inefficiency is hard to
pin down on the map. There are in-
efficient areas in Victoria as there are
in N.S.W. and Queensland, but a pre-
cise pattern has defied every survey
to date. Parts of- the north coast of
N.S.W., for instance, are highly pro-
ductive even though other parts are
depressed areas. The coastal strip be-
hind Sydney is climatically one of the
oddest in the continent (floods followed
by long dry spells), yet it includes some
very efficient dairy farms. Yet parts of
Victoria’s Gippsland, generally con-
sidered ideal for dairying, contain some
low productive areas.
In general there is no doubt that Vic-
toria (1,215,000 cows) is better suited
for dairying than N.S.W. (823,000
cows) or Queensland (733,000 cows).
The average Victorian cow produces
613 gallons a year, the N.S.W. cow 347
"It is even puzzling to know
how many dairy farmers
there are in Australia"
gallons, and the Queensland cow 306
gallons. But that doesn’t mean that you
rationalise the industry by casting
dairying out of N.S.W. and Queens-
land and concentrating on Victoria.
There are also good performances in
these two States, and South Australia
(165,000 cows), although its climate is
worse for dairying than the three east-
ern States, nevertheless produces an
annual average of 614 gallons per cow,
the best in Australia. The reason for this
is instructive: the areas in South Aus-
tralia chosen for dairying were chosen
because they were good for dairying
in the eastern States they were often
chosen because they were all that was
left over after the sheep men had had
their pick.
Comparisons of Australian dairy
farming with overseas dairy farming
can also be misleading. Some commen-
tators look at the simple figures and
work out a sum that goes something
like: In Australia 3.2 million cows pro-
duce 1516 million gallons. In Holland
1.7 million cows produce 1531 million
gallons. Therefore, Dutch cows or
Dutch farmers are twice as efficient as
Australian cows or Australian farmers.
Dairy farmers are correct in rejecting
such simple comparisons, since Aus-
tralian figures are dragged down by the
high proportion of inefficient farms and
by different climatic conditions. They
are likely instead to point out that Aus-
tralian dairy cattle are holding their
own in exports to Japan and other
countries in Asia in the face of firm
competition from Holland, Britain, and
the United States; or that while in the
United States one farm worker is esti-
mated to provide enough food for 26
persons, in Australia the figure is higher
—approximately 34 persons —although
it is recognised that the Australian
winter is less harsh, so that labor
requirements are less.
Another contrast: A month ago dairy-
ing land near Bairnsdale, in Gippsland,
changed hands at $7OO an acre, yet
dairy farms in Queensland can be
bought for as low as $3O an acre.
It is even a puzzle to know how many
dairy farmers there are in Australia.
If it is true that there are about three
million dairy cows and about 60,000
dairy farmers, then we get by simple
arithmetic an average of 50 cows per
farm. Yet, while it is easy enough to
find farms carrying from 50 to 200 or
300 cows, it is hard to find farms with
fewer than 50 cows, unless you include
someone who runs a few cows and takes
a job on the side. For this reason,
although the figure of 60,000 dairy
farmers is used by dairy industry
spokesmen, it seems suspect. Could, it
be that the $27 million a year dairy
subsidy benefits, in the main, only


30,000 to 40,000 genuine dairy farmers
and then some others who, if they need
help, would get better help from some
other form of Government welfare?
Even greater scepticism might be used
in examining the figure of 600,000
people directly or indirectly supported
by dairying, a figure used by industry
spokesmen. Since in 1965 there were
only 340 dairy factories employing
10,000 people directly, the 600,000 must
include the check-out girls in the super-
markets.
Let us get back to the 60,000 figure,
because it seems to set the heart of the
problem. There is a way of guessing
that the number of true dairy farmers
in Australia may be closer to 30,000 or
40,000 than 60,000. In Victoria, which
produces just under half the total milk
in Australia, State figures show that
there are only 15,000 herds of more than
30 cows; if these 15,000 herds produce
nearly half the milk produced in Aus-
tralia, it seems reasonable to assume
that 30,000 herds produce the major
portion of the total. Again, in N.S.W.,
it has been suggested that the number
of dairy farms has fallen by 1372 in
the past three years; if farms are con-
solidating at this rate there could,
possibly, be only about 11,000 dairy
farms in N.S.W.; if this is so it means
that only 11,000 farms in N.S.W. are
producing just under one-third of the
total; you come again to a figure of
about 30,000 real dairy farms. And you
might conclude that an industry gross-
ing something like $6OO million a year
($lOO million from exports) and com-
posed possibly of some 30,000 or so
genuine producers should not be that
badly off.
That some dairy farmers are doing
well is certainly beyond dispute. In
the efficient areas land values are
higher than ever. A startling specific
indication is the Heytesburg land
settlement scheme in the Western Dis-
trict of Victoria (which, initially, was
resisted by sheep interests). In this
scheme 260 farms are now working so
successfully that applications for 12 new
blocks thrown open exceed 600.
To find what is so attractive about
these dairying blocks it is first neces-
sary to understand what is wrong with
so many others. Many dairy farms were
opened up in the past not because they
were suitable for dairying but because
families wanted to get by on a subsist-
ence level. Between the gold rushes
and World War I, dairying was virtu-
ally the only farming pursuit that made
this possible. You needed money or
British backing to grow wool, with the
cheque coming in only once a year, and
in those years, before the McKay har-
vester, wheat offered limited scope. So
the selector, his only capital his brawn
and determination, set up as a subsist-
ence dairy farmer on whatever land he
could get, whether it was good for
dairying or not. After World War I had
created a need for Australian butter in
Britain, a bit more money came in, but
for many dairy farmers, caught up in
the results of the history of Australian
land settlement, it has been grim going
all the way, with butter the main hope.
For a man who remembers a child-
hood in which he milked by hand by
the light of an oil lamp and then
trudged to school along muddy tracks,
it does not yet seem believable that the
future for butter his main hope
is receding.
The reason why the Heytesburg
scheme is so successful (like the South
Australian dairy farms) is that it is
so different from the traditional dairy
farm. The blocks, at 200 acres each,
"Overall commodities subsidies
are not the best
way to solve the problem
of depressed areas"
are of suitable size; they are relatively
free of frost, so that good winter pasture
is available; they are in a 36in. rain-
fall belt; they will carry 60 cows for
a start and after pastures have been
consolidated about 100; in addition to
100 cows, each block should provide
about 3000 bales of hay annually; the
area has electricity; it is served by good
roads which make bulk handling easy;
it is well provided with schools and other
amenities; and it is only an hour by
road from Geelong and two hours
from Melbourne. It represents the
hope of the future.
And it shows that there is no “the
dairy problem.” The problem for the
industry is the 40 percent tail that holds
it back, a tail created by the industry’s
history, and often as a result of Govern-
ment policy. This means that there are
two dairy industries. There is that
part which is genuine dairy farming
and that part which is simply depressed
farming. With some spokesmen for the
industry this analysis is not popular:
the areas of genuine depression serve
a useful purpose to the industry as a
whole they justify the subsidies.
Yet overall commodity subsidies are
not the best way to solve the problem
of the depressed areas of smallholders.
While putting extra money into the
.pockets of successful men who farm in
’areas free from drought and flood, they
do not give much hope to the genuinely
depressed. Nor is Government regula-
tion likely to work. As Drane and
Edwards said in their memorable 1959
survey of the industry, Government
regulation is more likely to paralyse
the industry without ensuring “a
reasonably high and staple level of
farm income” because governments
tend to find “the unhappy middle
course,” neither free market nor full
control.
So far as the depressed areas are
concerned, what would seem needed
would be a special action within those
areas. They need specific regional
programs like, for example, the
Allegheny Mountains Authority in the
United States now, or the Tennessee
Valley Authority of some years ago.
An area obviously needing something
like this is the North Coast of N.S.W.,
at present suffering another bout of
floods, with more soil being swept out
to sea, and all industry, not only
dairying, demoralised. Over the past
30 years this area has taken three
extremely severe beatings from floods,
and several minor setbacks as well. It
needs special measures to revive its
fortunes.
In talking of such measures one
should remember that dairy farmers are
human beings. It is true that, simply
as a cold statistical consideration, it
would not necessarily matter to Aus-
tralia as a whole if we lost all of our
present earnings from butter and from
rice and sugar as well. Dr. Bruce
(“Northern Myths”) Davidson has esti-
mated that a 12 percent lift in earnings
from wool, meat, and wheat would
cover this loss. In addition, we would
save the money that goes toward subsi-
dising exports of butter, rice, and sugar.
But one cannot discuss dairy farming
as if it were a manufacturing industry.
It is also a way of life. In manufac-
turing, if a line is selling badly you
can kill it and try something else: at
the worst some of your workers will
have to find similar jobs elsewhere and
the dividend might drop. But the Aus-
tralian dairy farm is essentially a family
unit, in most cases wholly owned by the
family or, where it is a share farm, so
much of the family’s assets are held in
stock or machinery that this is also a
form of ownership. Many of these
dairying families have lived on their
farms for generations. Their sweat has
gone into clearing bush, sowing pas-
tures, raising calves, and all the other
facets of a form of farming that is
intensely personal. Although in the
depressed areas few schoolchildren
express any desire to be dairy farmers,
for the men in their thirties and up-
wards the break is a revolution in
life style. You can realise some


Dairy farmers
of the personal factors involved
when you consider that the rub
with the “consolidation plan” outlined
in the most recent Commonwealth
dairy legislation is that it implies that
some neighbors would be given Govern-
ment assistance to buy out other neigh-
bors, including cases where families
have lived side by side for several
generations.
Meanwhile new' voices with new ideas
are emerging in the industry, if mainly
on its marketing side. At the most
recent conference of the Victorian
Dairyfarmers’ Association the sugges-
tion was made that the retail price of
butter on the home market should be
reduced to increase demand. It is not
remarkable that the suggestion was
rejected, but what is remarkable is that
it got a hearing. The promoter of this
scheme, Mr. J. Barry, president of the
farmers’ association of the highly pro-
ductive Neerim-Jindivick area, sug-
gested that butterfat returns to produc-
ers should be dropped by 5c a pound
and that this should be passed on to
consumers. He also suggested that, since
an export surplus of butter is expected,
this should be “specialed” through re-
tailers who would undertake to parti-
cipate in special butter promotion cam-
paigns.
Mr. Barry said that of butter pro-
duced this season there would be a
surplus of 10,000 to 12,000 tons. If
this surplus were offered on the Aus-
tralian market at 39c a pound it would
return nearly $1 million more than the
same amount sold overseas. What it
amounts to is this: if butter were
“specialed” in the stores (at certain
times, in promotion campaigns) at 11c
a pound under the price you now pay,
would you buy an extra three pounds
a year? If Australians would do this,
the export loss would be more than
covered.
It has to be recognised, however, that
industry leaders who opposed this
scheme did so for reasons other than
obstinate conservatism. It is all very
well, they can say, for Mr. Barry, who
comes from a highly efficient area, to
talk about price reduction, but for the
weaker areas it could be disastrous. The
industry, while not going as far as
Mr. Barry, is now adopting an incentive
scheme in which manufacturers and dis-
tributors will be reimbursed for
approved marketing and promotion
expenses above their normal costs. The
scheme, it is hoped, will result in better
packaging, presentation, and store pro-
motion. Whether it will also result in
foil-wrapping remains to be seen.
With butter now in a state of crisis,
there are indications that the Australian
Dairy Produce Board, first formed to
aid exports, will now move to extend
its marketing powers in the home
market. One can imagine the argu-
ments that would be put forward: Many
previously prosperous country centres
are declining . . . Dairy farmers get
poor returns . . . The margarine threat
grows . . . Butter consumption per head
is declining.
One can also imagine the replies that
will be made to these arguments: The
decline of country centres started long
ago and is due as much to the motor
car and the elimination of the horse
and buggy as anything else . . . The
statistics of poor returns to dairy farm-
ers ignore the fact that these statistics
are loaded by a tail which may not be
relevant . . . The growing of oilseed
for margarine is as legitimate a farm-
ing activity as the milking of cows . . .
A reduction in prices might increase
consumption of butter.
The cause of battle for an extension
of the Dairy Board’s powers could be
"New voices with new
ideas are now emerging
in the industry"
the suggestion that there should be
transferable butterfat production
quotas, which would have a value, like
a taxi licence, and which would be
used to control over-production.
There seems no reason why existing
State authorities could not administer
these quotas, but, boards being boards,
the Dairy Board is likely to have
another answer. The idea has merit.
Some other countries which subsidise
dairying Britain, Holland, the Scan-
dinavian countries demand produc-
tion quotas, and if a farmer does not
meet his quota he is penalised or cut
off. But there are also dangers, as in
any other scheme of “orderly market-
ing.”
The principal “threat” that might be
produced in argument for an extension
of powers is the development of “long
life” milk. By this irradiated heat pro-
cess which destroys bacteria, milk is
made to hold its quality for up to six
months without refrigeration. It would
keep in containers, just like beer. It
would simplify marketing greatly,
eliminating the morning milk round so
that housewives could buy milk in bulk,
once a week if they wanted to. It would
also eliminate the tedium of milking
twice a day on the farms to catch the
milk truck. And it would dispose of
seasonal surpluses.
In fact, in South Australia, where
inefficiency is not a problem, “long life”
milk is likely to be marketed by 1968
but in the eastern States dairy farmers
oppose it strongly. The marketing of
“long life” milk would assist efficient
farmers at the expense of inefficient
ones, and the inefficient farmers are the
tail that wags the cow. It should be
recognised, however, that other eastern-
ers score a more acceptable marketing
point against “long life” milk. Although
they are misleading when they describe
it as “sterilised,” a term without scien-
tific foundation, they are honest when
they express doubt as to whether the
public would find “long life” milk as
“fresh” as milk delivered by the milk-
man in the early hours. It is true that
milk is now 24 hours old by the time
it is delivered, the early morning round
being simply a relic of the day when
cows were milked in suburban pad-
docks. But it is also true that consumers
are not necessarily rational animals. In
fact, most marketing concepts are built
on the opposite assumption.
While this battle is being fought out,
another, and underground, battle is
absorbing some of the interest of the
industry. The biggest threat to the
power and prestige of the Dairy Board
has not been margarine but the acti-
vities of private enterprise.
In overseas marketing, private enter-
prise factories pioneered good markets
in Singapore, Hong Kong, and other
areas in Asia for Australian condensed
milk ten years ago (with help from
the Dairy Board in promotion). The
Dairy Board then set up its own plants
in Singapore, Bangkok, and Manila.
The only conclusion that can be drawn
is that sales from these factories have
eroded the markets pioneered by com-
panies based in Australia.
At the same time, within Australia,
private enterprise factories are expand-
ing sales of yoghurt, cream cheese, and
other products on the home market.
There is a high degree of American
investment in private-enterprise dairy
processing in Australia and this is now
offsetting the “orderly marketing”
system which grew out of the depres-
sion and which was consolidated in the
Chifley era. Meanwhile the co-
operatives are merging themselves into
monoliths. The three biggest co-
operatives in Victoria are merging this
month into Amalgamated Co-Operative
Marketers Ltd. and in N.S.W., where
the number of co-ops has fallen from
142 to 88 in the past 20 years, there
is fear for good reason of in-
trusion into their territory by both
private enterprise and giant Victorian
co-ops. It is believed that a butterfat
quota system, administered by the
Dairy Board, would lead to a return
to “orderly marketing.”
It might also, of course, deprive
the consumer of dairy products he is
entitled to have just as he is entitled
to margarine from wholly produced
Australian oilseed. But the history of
“orderly marketing” in Australia sug-
gests that the consumer is the las* - cab
off the rank.


The gentleman reader
in the British Museum
By APRIL HERSEY
A SLIGHTLY CRUMPLED, curly-
headed man with exceptionally clear
blue-grey eyes and a freckled brow
which wrinkles up thoughtfully between
statements is Peter Mathers, aged 36,
writer of “Trap,” the novel which won
this year’s Miles Franklin Award. With
a faded buttercup (so that I would
know him) in his buttonhole and
determinedly Australian-looking bare
feet in sandals, he leant against a pillar
at the British Museum, nervously wait-
ing to be interviewed, a very battered
soft briefcase at his feet and the great
Museum, bathed in pale English sun-
shine, rising behind him.
This is where he labors daily, but
not for himself. He is referred to as a
“gentleman reader” and must keep the
extremely gentlemanly hours of the
British Museum, which assumes that no
gentleman would care to read before
9.30 a.m. or wish to continue after
5 p.m., and that he has better things
to do with his Sunday than be in a
library. Mathers would like the hours
extended, for what he is doing is
carrying out research at an hourly rate
for other writers.
Generally this work is extremely
dreary, though there was one Danish
pastor who wanted to know about an
English writer who is believed to have
spent the night with a famous suffra-
gette. On another occasion he spent
four months researching the Restoration
comedies which enabled him to handle
first editions and early “Spectators”
and “Tatlers.” But usually it is a mat-
ter of working hard at 10/- an hour and
he wishes the hours were longer.
Mr. Mathers won the Miles Franklin
Award in April. Through a series of
mishaps he did not get the cheque until
late in June. He is a poor man by any
standard even England’s.
“Actually I don’t mind working,” he
said. “I’m old-fashioned enough to con-
sider that labor is good for the soul.
I think that even hard physical labor-
ing can be something of a break. I’ve
turned my hands to most things.”
He doesn’t, in fact, have the hands
of a gentleman reader, and he doesn’t
have the physique. He looks more like
an Irishman than an Australian, though
he has no Celtic strain in him, or none
that he knows of, and has the nuggety
broad-shouldered look that would be
more at home on a ship or a farm than
under the dome of the British Museum.
This isn’t surprising since he is the
son of a British seaman who came to
Sydney in the 19305. After leaving
Sydney High School at 16 in fourth
year, Mathers went on to do an agri-
cultural course and in the mid-’fifties
was toiling away on a farm on the
North Coast trying to raise winter crops
of tomatoes.
After these failed, he Wandered
around Australia. “It was the complete
‘Seeing Australia First’ thing,” he said.
“The whole trite business of being on
the track. For two years I worked
and wandered on and worked again at
anything that was going. Shearing,
farming, any trade, any job. Then I
arrived in Melbourne in 1960, and took
a steady job in the Public Service.”
This was in 1963 and during this
year of “extreme steadiness” he met
his wife, Muriel, who had also followed
many jobs, mainly teaching, research
and library. work, some of which she
had done in New York. After they
were married they decided to move on
to England.
Mathers is curiously honest about
himself. “I suppose I was filled with
the desire to reform Australia but basic-
ally my conceit told me that I would
probably do better here.
“And I came because I suppose in
the back of my mind I just wanted to
see it. And Melbourne in 1964 was
such a stinking, sanctimonious city, so
repressive, and with a degree of puri-
tanism that was not even vital, just
dreary. I had to get away.”
He had been writing since his boy-
hood and already had one novel com-
pleted (still unpublished) and “Trap,”
on which he was working. He stayed for
a while in Italy and in Spain writing
and rewriting. When he arrived in
London he had something to show a
publisher. Heinemann took out an
option but later dropped it. Finally
Cassells decided to print it, and the first
edition was released in Australia. He
has not so far made much money from
it.
“Well I’d rather be poor in England
than poor in Australia,” Mathers said.
“There is so much happening here. So
much to do and see most of it free
music, art shows. In fact, these dis-
tractions tend to drag you away from
working. The jazz clubs cost about one
pound a year, and then there’s the
Festival Hall. It’s a joke to talk about
swinging England, but the place moves
in a different way.”
The liveliness has inspired him to
keep on working hard and his next
Peter Mathers ... scream and scream
novel will have a London background.
His variety of jobs in London, ranging
through research to a brewery job and
on to research for city stockbrokers, has
given him what he hopes is plenty of
background material. “Though writing
is one of those things,” he added, “you
keep wondering how in hell you’ll ever
finish another novel.”
He has also been commissioned to
write a play for the Old Tote Theatre.
He has written several plays and hopes
to break into television.
He has also been offered a fellowship
at Pittsburgh University in the United
States. “I would be a Schubert fellow
and be able to write plays.” He hesi-
tated for a moment. “But the allow-
ance they talk about doesn’t make
sense when you have a wife and
children.”
He has two daughters, Sarah, aged
two, and Zoe, one. Muriel Mathers
teaches two days a week at an in-
fants’ school near Islington. She finds
it interesting but remarks that “kids are
tough in London, even the little ones.”
She finds London difficult with chil-
dren. “Good accommodation is so much
easier to find in Australia,” she said.
She would like to go back, at least for
a while.
“I wouldn’t mind going back, either,”
Mathers said. “I see no reason to stay
in one place. I worked in a cheap cot-
tage in Wales for a while, snowed in
and freezing. Isolation doesn’t matter.
And there are better Australian plays
that have never been mounted than we
see in the West End.
“It is very stimulating here. Prob-
ably the nation is in a decline, but it
is a pleasant, fine decay. Only the
weather is terrible. Sometimes in win-
ter when they are spreading grit on
the icy roads so that you can walk
and it is pitch-dark at 4 p.m., I feel
I could just drape myself around one
of those pillars at the British Museum
and scream and scream and scream.”


The Country Party's two-way stretch
FOR Mr. McEWEN and the Country
Party the sudden attack on the Basic
Industries Group is just a small incident
in their adjustment to new political
realities, realities which demand a
choice almost literally between Sydney
and the bush. Unless the Country
Party can broaden its base to include
the interests of new economic groups
and geographic areas, it faces deci-
mation and perhaps, in the long run,
extinction.
Mr. McEwen and other Country
Party leaders are reported to be con-
sidering the necessity of changing the
name of the Party to give it a less
sectional and more urban and national
image. The name “Centre Party” is one
that has been strongly proposed. Mr.
McEwen is refusing to run away from
the following unpleasant facts:
1. When he retires from the Federal
parliamentary leadership there will be
nobody with half his force, tactical skill,
or prestige to protect the Party’s
interests. Neither Mr. Anthony nor
Mr. Sinclair has it in him to earn a
title like “Mac the Knife.”
2. A number of prominent Liberals
are privately hostile to the Country
Party’s economic policies and are envi-
ous of its positions in cabinet and the
ministry.
3. Relative to urban population,
rural population is declining. Since
1950 rural areas have declined in popu-
lation from about 21 percent of the
national total to about 16 percent.
This trend is likely to continue for some
time. It seems likely that a significant
number of country people who move
from farms to country towns change
their voting habits in ' favor of the
Liberal Party.
4. If Britain enters the Common
Market the farmers most likely to suf-
fer loss and even collapse are those
most firmly committed to the Country-
Party, the dairy, fruit, and sugar farm-
ers. Even without the Common Market
the future of these industries will be
difficult.
5. The larger woolgrowers are now
organising against the subsidies-tariff
economic complex, which, they believe,
depends on the strategies of McEwen,
and which is a major factor in increas-
ing the costs of wool production.
6. Manufacturing and commercial
interests who gain nothing from tariffs
are now putting strong political pres-
sure on to the Treasury and the Liberal
Party to move against the protective
policies of the Country Party and the
Department of Trade.
7. In recent years there has been a
mounting discontent among econo-
mists, academics, journalists, and other
publicists with the Australian subsidy-
tariff set-up. Their influence is evident
in their changing attitudes in the ranks
Mr. McEwen... the unpleasant facts
of the four major parties, and in the
statements of Mr. Bury, Dr. Cairns,
Mr. Santamaria, Mr. Gordon Barton,
and Mr. Charles Russell.
The forces ranging against him are
formidable, and in response Mr.
McEwen has launched his bitter attack
on enemies “unseen and unknown, its
members faceless and .nameless” who
shelter beneath the title “Basic Indus-
tries Group.”
The attack has had the immediate
effects of rallying Mr. Holt to the
Country Party’s defence, although it
has also given the 8.1. G., as they claim,
“a million dollars’ worth of free pub-
licity” and brought their cause into the
headlines.
What Mr. McEwen needs most is to
draw new supporters to his side. The
Country Party leaders know that
they must move into urban electorates
BY BRIAN BUCKLEY
if they are to survive as a national poli-
tical influence and they need the sup-
port of some manufacturers and
unionists to do it. In their favor is the
fact that some of our biggest and
wealthiest industrial corporations, such
as GM-H, Lord, ICI, are vitally con-
cerned to preserve their tariff protec-
tion.
Mr. McEwen has now come to
realise that the, subsidies-tariff complex
cannot be much longer defended by the
Country Party alone, but that the
present problems offer the Country-
Party the chance to extend its base
into urban centres.
A new kind of Centre Party, backed
by subsidised farmers and protected
manufacturers, and attracting some of
the votes of workers in protected indus-
tries, offers Country Party interests
their best chance of survival. The next
Lederal election could see the Country
Party trying itself out with a high
tariff policy in outer suburban elec-
torates.
One shot left in Mr. McEwen’s
magazine is the provision of some kind
of subsidy, tax concession, or further
bounty for wool. It is unlikely that
the larger woolgrowers such as those in
the 8.1. G. will be influenced by such an
offer, since they know that the price
will be the strengthening of tariffs, but
smaller woolgrowers and mixed wheat
and wool and meat and wool farmers
may be bought by such an offer. At
present the Government assists the wool
industry with tax concessions, the $22
million wool promotion scheme, and
part of the $2B million it pays in
fertiliser bounties.
Another potential source of con-
solation for Mr. McEwen is the rather
strange nature of the alliance of forces
gathered around the 8.1. G. Mr. Charles
Russell, the wealthy Queensland
grazier and businessman, has close asso-
ciations with Sir Raphael Cilento and
the “International News Review”
group. Russell declares that he is a
former Country Party MP, but now
a member of the Liberal Party. The
“International News Review” repre-
sents a complex of mostly extreme
Right-wing opinion. Russell’s associa-
tions with it do not rest easily alongside
his associations with the Liberal Reform
Group, which has a number of business
interests opposed to the subsidies-tariff
policies of McEwen and the Depart-
ment of Trade, but which is also
strongly opposed to the Australian
commitment against Communism in
Vietnam and almost everything the
'lnternational News Review” group
stand for.
But there is a lot more strength to
the opposition to the McEwen-Country
Party-Trade Department alliance than
that represented in the 8.1. G. and the
Liberal Reform Group. The Liberal
Party is gathering the bulk of the hostile
forces, but even the Labor Party is be-
coming aware of the cost of the sub-
sidies-tariff complex. The. Liberal Party
has become more concerned with rural
matters in the past few years. The
N.S.W. secretary of the Party, Mr. John
Garrick, recently wrote, “There, is a
growing and already significant expert-
ness within the Liberal Party in special-
ised rural matters. This has evolved
both by the election of prominent farrn-
e.rs to the parliaments and by the very
successful functioning of Lederal and
State rural committees.”
What he did not say was that the
intention of many members of these
rural committees, and the State execu-
tives which they advise, is to put the
Country Party out of business and to
take over its vote. Most of the big wool
interests are already in the process of
turning over. And the other traditional
bases of Country Party support are
shrinking. The only real alternative
for Mr. McEwen is to take the fight
into Liberal and, if possible, Labor terri-
tory.

Greater than the glory that was Rome
By CHARLES HIGHAM
TEMPERATURE in Las Vegas, 120
degrees; the plane jolts and bucks over
the Sierra Nevada, shark-toothed in a
coating of summer ice, then descends
with a brutal thwack into the middle
of nothing. The great blanket of sand
shimmering under the hard light of the
Nevada sky is a dirty beige, rumpled
now and again into half-dunes made
by the wind. Ribbons of road stripe the
surface, dead-straight for hundreds of
miles, scissored by the horizon. Scrub
patches the desert, no birds fly, nothing
moves except cars, hot and glittering,
their metal bouncing the sun back like
mirrors. Nobody walks, except hastily
to the waiting vehicles that will drive
them to their destination from the air-
port. Inside the car bound for Vegas,
somebody, an Englishman, it seems,
starts to push back a window. A woman
smacks it shut.
Huge advertising signs straddle the
desert, mounted on spindly poles:
STARDUST, MIDNIGHT CHUCK-
WAGON, HORSESHOE ALADDIN,
FOUR QUEENS, and biggest of
all DRUGS, a neon explosion of
light in mid-afternoon, spinning away
against the crumpled cardboard-
colored foothills of the distant Sierras.
Pink apartment buildings look lost,
luxurious encampments straggling out
across the ground as barren as asphalt.
Here, too, are EXECUTIVE SUITES,
HOW SUITE THEY ARE! bland
clumps of brown or grey concrete
slapped down hard on the plain. The
glimpses you get through doorways
and windows suggest a concentration
camp redone by a Hollywood art-
director. Now we are in The Strip:
main artery of Vegas, flanked by elec-
trical stars that sparkle feebly against
daylight, decorated by the whirling
satellites of the giant Saturn outside
the Stardust Hotel, CHICKEN AND
WAFFLES spelt out in pink, and, as
one of our first stopping places, Caesars
(no apostrophe) Palace.
After Caesars Palace, you feel noth-
ing can look half as strange again.
At the end of a fountain avenue,
boasting 700,000 gallons of water (“at
least 100,000 gallons are up in the
air at once,” somebody says), the
Winged Victory of Samothrace in-
congruously celebrated a marble hymn
to Ancient Rome. Built for $2B million
(of which $lO million was lent by
Jimmy Hoffa’s teamsters’ brother-
hood), this hotel-cum-gambling hell is
flanked in a half-moon by a mad
collection of classical statuary: re-
productions of the Venus de Milo and
Michelangelo’s David, Bologna’s Rape
of the Sabine Women irrupting in the
midst of a fountain. The brochure
hurls it all at you: “I, Caesar, have
dedicated this noble edifice to be the
world’s most magnificent playground
. . . set in a thrilling and verdant oasis,
in the vital heart of pulsating Las
Vegas. A jewel to behold ... a delight
of elegance to revel and luxuriate in
. . . the summit of breathtaking enchant-
ment, night and day. By royal decree
. . . Caesars Palace welcomes you!”
Enter the foyer, and you are already
numb: CAESARS and CLEOPATRAS
mark the doors of the rest-rooms, and
CAESAR’S FORUM, the vast central
gambling hall, has 20 columns of
Italian marble, with a chandelier con-
taining 1600 lightbulbs and 120,000
separate crystal prisms; a nightclub, the
CIRCUS MAXIMUS, with the seats in
imperial-purple alcoves rimmed around
the top with gilt bayleaves; a
BACCHANAL ROOM, “for gourmet
dining,” the dishes served in this
“palatial gustatorium” borne by torch-
bearing togaed waiters; NERO’S
NOOK, “a palatial caravanserai of
ecstasy, here you will enjoy exotic nec-
tars, the throbbing excitement of swing
sounds”; a coffee shop, THE NOSH-
ORI U M ; the MAGNIFICENT
ROMAN BATHS WITH MASSEURS
AND MASSEUSES; A SUPERB TON-
SORIAL ROOM STAFFED BY
MASTER BARBERS . . .
After Caesars Palace, the limousine
winds through drive after entrance
drive, each hotel blazing with mauve,
purple, and green colors, flanked by
dusty clumps of shrub. After an hour
I am at the Sahara: my room high in
a skyscraper block, the phone gently
chiming to announce a recorded voice
offering complimentary refreshments,
curtains thickly drawn against the white
blaze of 5 p.m. I open them, and the
desert landscape leaps in: I am looking
at a world as desolate as the moon. A
car sparkles past, then time and move-
ment seem to stop. Not even a condor
swoops over the hills.
In the lobby one group perched at a
baccarat table has been gambling, some-
one says, for 16 hours, losing and win-
ning something approaching the
national deficit of Luxembourg. Under
the spangled ceiling the tables stretch
away, roulette wheels spinning, bingo
games flashing bright numbers on the
walls, green baize tables clicking with
ivory counters, croupiers grunting or
wailing their mysterious Esperanto. I
walk out into a wall of heat, and for
half an hour see only three other people
also walking; I move in a daze froifi
hall to hall of the hotels, as the poker
machines glow in welcome, rank upon
rank, mauve, black, silver, purple,
orange, shining a cornucopia of fruit
and flowers and other symbols as their
three whirling bands click ruinously into
place.
In the past ten years Las Vegas has
had a drastic financial boom. Four hun-
dred restaurants, boast the brochures,
“slake the appetite of 12,000,000 visitors
annually . . . luncheon buffets offer
dozens of tantalising dishes, (it is) a
sort of gustatory roulette.” At the Sul-
tan’s Table at the Dunes a band re-
volves on a giant Lazy Susan against a
ceiling-high waterfall that changes from
raspberry to violet in seconds; the “sea-
food palace” at the same hotel, The
Dome of the Sea, offers a blonde mer-
maid who strums a golden harp, float-
ing through the tables on an outsize
lily pad. At the Desert Inn there is the
Monte Carlo Room: “Antique white
and gold Louis XIV furnishings,
accented with upholstery of a deep-
tufted ruby-red material with the feel
of fine velvet, nevej- fail to draw an
audible gasp.” There are 37,000 hotel
rooms in Las Vegas, and performers
there are paid $50,000 minimum a week
(Not only does the Las Vegas menu
offer you such “gustatory glories” as
JONES LINK SAUSAGES WRAP-
PED IN THIN PANCAKES DRIP-
PING WITH MAPLE SYRUP AND
MELTED BUTTER but Pearl Bailey,
Red Skelton, Juliet Prowse, Danny
Kaye, and George Burns as well.)
At night, the Antonioni landscape
of daytime Las Vegas changes into a
dazzle of horseshoes, disembodied
limbs, asteroids, and flashing swords of
artificial light; the beautiful low-slung
desert stars are totally eclipsed. Down-
town, one is reminded that Las Vegas
has an industry just as big as gambling:
marriages. In California, you need a
blood-test and a wait of three days,
but here you need nothing e,xcept the
price of the ceremony. Forty thousand
marriages are solemnised here a year,
and you don’t even have to leave
the marriage parlor: at the back of
the chapel is a motel, and couples
simply move from one room to another
for the wedding night. THE CUPID
WEDDING CHAPEL, with an outsize
cupid armed with bow and arrow, rises
up as I drive past, and THE LITTLE
WHITE CHAPEL is practically next
door. If one place is busy serving
“customer couples,” another can
accommodate you in this Reno in re-
verse.
Later that evening, I am at the
Casino Centre 1,177,000 bulbs,
“237,000 ft. or 42 miles of neon tub-
ing” kept going on an electric bill of
$63,500 a month. And at the Tropi-
cana, where the ceiling is a galaxy of
blue sequin stars, hung with silver
chains, the carpet moss-green, the res-
taurant is flanked by purple caryatids,
and 700 people pack it to see the
Folies Bergere: Hermes Pan’s brilliant
choreography involves the audience in
the. spectacle, so that girls descend
Gambling is the chief reason for Nevada’s current boom
from the ceiling waving silver fans,
men with faces made mask-like by
make-up dance round the whole room
in yellow top hats and tails, and
yellow feathers shower over the tables,
the decor ranges from an astonishingly
vulgar re-creation of 18th-century Ver-
sailles to a nocturnal scene in modern
Paris, and Tibor Rudas, of Sydney,
stages a combined film and live action
number that spectacularly works:
figures dancing out of the screen to-
ward the audience and then back again,
stockbrokers reaching out gleefully to
them like excited children. A quick
visit to Caesars Palace again to talk
back-stage to a pale and pretty Juliet
Prowse before the midnight perform-
Hotel Sahara at Las Vegas... 16
hours solid of baccarat
ance of “Sweet Charity,” and then,
at the pink pavilion of the Flamingo,
swarming with the biggest gambling
crowd of all, Pearl Bailey in black
silk and diamonds as big as the Ritz,
hamming it up with limitless bravado
until 2 a.m.
It was hard, leaving Las Vegas next
morning, to realise that not far away
is the Nevada testing ground of the
Atomic Energy Commission, and an
air base housing 6000 men. The air-
port is thronged with military per-
sonnel, marines are playing the poker
machines in the airport lobbies, and
the man sitting next to me on the
plane turns out to be a bomb scientist.
But even now these realisations don’t
make reality intrude. I look down, and
the last thing I see is DRUGS, still
spinning bright silver against the
mountains.
We hop over the Sierra Nevada in
25 minutes, a blanket of thick white
Los Angeles smog smudges the win-
dows, and somebody behind me says:
“I lost $25,000 down there, and

OVERSEAS
Mrs. Gandhi needs a monsoon
to dilute her troubles
THE FUTURE of Prime Minister Mrs.
Indira Gandhi’s Government, the fate
of a number of State Governments,
and the political calculations of the
Chinese Communists in relation to
India are dependent on one single
factor the monsoon.
If the September crops fail because
of drought or floods, it will be all up
with the shaky Congress Government
in Delhi.
June, July, and August are always
lean months, when food stocks are
depleted and the harvest is yet to be
gathered. This season will be leaner
than usual because the closure of the
Suez Canal has affected grain
deliveries from the United States. On
top of that, labor trouble in both
Calcutta and Bombay ports is delay-
ing the unloading of grains by days,
sometimes weeks.
Congress Party leaders, apart from
Mrs. Gandhi, are already under severe
attack from younger members of the
party for providing weak and vacillat-
ing leadership. About 200 Members of
Parliament, mainly from North India,
and including Congressmen, have writ-
ten to Mrs. Gandhi, opposing her plan
to postpone the replacement of Eng-
lish by Hindi as the official language.
Legislation is to be introduced on this
subject after persistent pressure from
the bitterly anti-Hindu areas of the
south.
The Prime Minister has also dis-
covered that the resolution passed by
the All-India Congress Committee,
recommending the abolition of privy
purses for Indian princes, cannot be
carried out, because that would violate
a number of properties. As the angry
men and women of the Congress have
made this a test issue, Mrs. Gandhi will
not find it easy to override the Party’s
mandate without damage to herself.
Only a good monsoon can help her
to meet all these challenges. Two square
meals a day in every Indian stomach
will leave her critics floored. She would
also be able to deal with a number
of non-Congress governments which
have been defying the centre and are
trying to ensure the destruction of the
Congress Party for all time by
encouraging defections.
Above all, a good monsoon will give
her a chance to get rid of the pro-
Peking Communist-dominated Govern-
ment in West Bengal. A section of the
Communists is being encouraged by
Peking to start insurrectionary move-
ments.
Such a movement exists in a small
village called Naxalbari, in North
Bengal, adjoining Nepal, where Com-
munist rebels have set up a “free zone,”
which Peking radio describes as “the
front paw of the revolution.” Several
landlords in the area have been
expropriated and punished for “crimes
against the people.”
The State Government is an uneasy
coalition of Communists and non-
Communists, but the Communists are
the most important constituent and have
the biggest popular base. Although
communist Ministers have disowned
the Naxalbari “adventures,” they are
afraid that if action is taken against
the rebels the bulk of their following
will go over to the Robin Hoods in the
party.
Mrs. Gandhi can easily crush the
movement by toppling the State Gov-
ernment and sending in the Army, but
she and her advisers are afraid that if
after doing that they are unable to feed
the rice-hungry people of West Bengal
there might be more Naxalbaris in that
volatile State.
If the monsoon plays fair, the West
Bengal Government will be out by the
Mrs. Gandhi... two meals a day in
every stomach could, save her, too
end of the year. So far the rains have
been in time and in adequate quantity.
Even the famine-stricken people of
Bihar have begun to look up, but India,
wdro controls the weather in the Hindu
Pantheon, is a terribly uncertain god,
and, moreover, is also the destroyer of
cities, which description wall hearten the
Chinese, who are urging their followers
in Naxalbari to establish rural bases and
“use the villages to encircle the cities.”
Britain
Home thoughts
A STRONG FEELING that Britain
should no longer take sides in world
crises, and a widespread cynicism about
British ability to influence international
trends anyway, came strikingly to the
surface in London last week. An opinion
poll conducted by the influential “Sun-
day Times” showed that when other
people’s troubles come Britain’s way in
future, she quite definitely wants to opt
out.
The poll conclusions were seen as a
clear departure from what has been
regarded for centuries as the essentially
British attitude to participation in inter-
national affairs.
Reporting the findings of Opinion
Research Centre, which conducted its
poll, the “Sunday Times” said voters
were asked which countries they thought
had about the same power as Britain.
France came in an easy winner (de-
spite her objection to Britain’s Common
Market application) with 38 percent of
the votes. The U.S. and Germany,
were equal second, each with 22 per-
cent. Then came Canada 20, Sweden
11, Russia 10, Italy 9, Japan 8, Switzer-
land 7, and China 5. (The figures do
not add up to 100 because some answers
mentioned more than one country.)
About a quarter of the voters still put
Britain on a par with the super powers
-—America and Russia —but this group
contained a preponderant number of
elderly people, women, and unskilled
manual workers.
The further question asked was: “If
there was a major world crisis and a
threat of war between Russia and
America, do you think Britain should
help and support the U.S. or just make
sure we do not get involved?”
“Make sure we don’t get involved
got 63 percent of votes. “Help and
support the U.S.” 28, and ‘ Don t
know” only nine.
A final question was how Britons saw

the most important thing was to try to

The “Sunday Times” concluded from

say they wanted to become “Little

Thailand
"Blue Hills"
AS PEKING RADIO continued to flail
targets near and far last week, an “In-
visible Enemy” of Australian origin
continued bouncing a propaganda
counterblast into China, loud and clear,
from remote north-east Thailand.
“The Invisible Enemy” is a radio
soap opera, a sort of Thai “Blue Hills,”
and an important part of a communica-
tions revolution in one part of village
Asia which Australia has helped to
bring about.
North-east Thailand is an arid,
poverty-stricken plateau enclosed in a
great bend of the Mekong River. It
borders Laos to the east and Cambodia
across the Cardamon Mountains to the
south. This region is a much larger
part of Thailand than is generally
realised, for its 65,000 square miles
and ten million people represent
roughly a third of Thailand’s total land
area and population.
In a region without newspapers,
the propaganda implications of radio,
no respecter of frontiers, are very
great. More especially with the de-
velopment of cheap, portable tran-
sistors. China’s Communists were quick
to realise this, and for some years now
an enormous medium-wave station pos-
sibly as powerful as 1000 kilowatts,
and certainly one of the largest in the
world, has been operating from a loca-
tion in or near Kunming, in Yunnan
Province, broadcasting in various dia-
lects to South-East Asia.
For a period the powerful Chinese
signal boomed into north-east Thailand
at many times the power of any Bang-
kok station, and represented by far the
loudest sound on the dial of any radio.
It was through a request by Thailand
for provision of a network of stations
to answer this challenge that an Aus-
tralian civil-aid project swung into the
counter-propaganda action.
As a stopgap, a 50-kilowatt portable
transmitter was installed in 1963 outside
Khon Kaen, capital of north-east Thai-
land. An Australian adviser was
stationed there to advise on program
development.
At that stage surveys revealed that
80 percent of the potential audience
tuned in regularly to broadcasts from
Yunnan. A little more than a year
later, 70 percent of the audience had
switched over to the Thai Government
station in Khon Kaen. Surveys in both
instances were based on actual know-
ledge of the programs revealed by a
large cross-section of the audience.
By 1965 there was an Australian
network of three stations - 50 kilo-
watts each in Korat and Khon Kaen
and ten kilowatts in Übol providing
a reliable, powerful signal in the three
regions and what was technically re-
garded as the best possible blanket
coverage in the north-east.
Success of the network was not due to
slogan-shouting, for, even if they bother
to listen, most of this goes over the
heads of the village people, anyway.
Indeed, it was the fact that Radio
Peking began turning over so much of
its air time to dull and, to the villager,
incomprehensible accounts of China’s
ideological dispute with Russia that
slashed the Red “ratings” once an
alternative of reasonable power became
available.
But bad programming on one station
would not necessarily make an audience
listen to another one. Success of the
Khon Kaen station followed on-the-spot
assessments of what listeners wanted to
hear. New forms had to be found be-
cause the Western radio conventions
the “straight” talk, the fast-moving
interview session, and the news bulle-
tin had been tried and found
wanting.
Instead listeners were attracted initi-
ally by large slices of the ribald north-
east Thai and Laotian folk opera called
mohlam. Use of the local language, sig-
nificantly different from Bangkok Thai,
also helped, and as the “ratings” lifted,
simple news sessions were introduced,
with plenty of “parish pump” items
about village life and economy.
Then came “The Invisible Enemy,”
a serial about the day-to-day life of a
typical village family. It was an
immediate success. Its purpose was to
give basic information about health and
hygiene in an attempt to check the
further spread of epidemic haemor-
rhagic fever in the region. Many people,
especially children, would die unless
they could be shown how to recognise
the disease and seek help.
Within a few months of the first
episode of “The Enemy,” surveys
showed that 54 percent of sets were
tuned to it, and within six months
commercial networks were buying it and
broadcasting it under a sponsorship in
other parts of Thailand.
In this project the little plastic tran-
sistor has become a bigger influence on
the zonal loyalities of one part of vil-
lage Asia than any amount of guns and
butter.


ART AND ENTERTAINMENT
Just like everyone else
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
“MAA-A-A-MEE, I’d walk a million
miles for one of your smiles, Maa-a-a-
mee . . .” It’s Barry Crocker throw-
ing himself heart and soul into rehear-
sal; rushing into Hazel Phillips’ dressing-
room, which is done out in purple
leatherette with a dash of lime and
mushroom, is Sue, her secretary, who
says she’s sorry about the waiting, Miss
Phillips is caught up with Don Deven-
dorf but she won’t be long.
“. . . Toot, tooot, toootsie gooooood-
bye, toot, toot, tootsie don’t ker-ryyyyyy
55
There’s a babble of female chatter
outside, and Miss Phillips ambles in
wearing a tired expression, a leopard
coat with matching hat, and underneath
that an orange coat and orange dress.
Her shoes are orange. Who are you?
Haze on television
Oh, Lord, she’d forgotten. She’s dread-
fully sorry. Is it all right if she gets
changed? Miss Phillips is in her flesh-
pink bra and girdle when Sue returns,
quivering, and says how was he? Is
he all right? She means, is he smashing?
Miss Phillips’ tired expression is re-
placed with ecstasy. Wow! Don Deven-
dorf is ab-so-lutely marvellous. Good-
looking. Intelligent. Sharp. You know,
Haze nearly flipped when she saw him
again. To be honest, she hadn’t really
taken him in in San Francisco.
She is now in a red and grey check
suit supplied with the compliments of
a shop on the North Shore, where she
gets her TV clothes free, thank good-
ness, when Monica Prendergast, “Girl
Talk’s” director, appears, carrying
a giant display of gladioli. Monica!
Your hair. It’s marvellous like that.
Isn’t it marvellous like that, Sue?
Monica says, well, it makes a change,
but she rather liked it piled up the way
Haze wore hers yesterday, all floppy
and soft. Anyway, how did it go with
Don?
Everyone’s concerned about the
American who has come to guest-
compere “Girl Talk” because everyone’s
concerned about Miss Phillips. All that
Press criticism about her hurt them as
much as it hurt her, it was so unfair and
vicious, but when the Logies came
along that was proof how the viewers
felt about her. All Channel Ten, save
the bosses, call the new “In Town To-
night” show Llazel’s show. This makes
Miss Phillips laugh. The thing is, no
one’s paying her any extra, and she
thinks they should. This brings her tele-
vision output up to six live shows a
week, and financially the reward is
about a clear $2OO. She could make 600
pounds in the clubs.
“. . . Well, it’s fantastic. We have so
much in common. He’s Scorpio, like
me, he paints and flies—” a television
memory got her through the exams for
her licence, but she can’t remember a
thing now “-—the only trouble is, I’ll
have to play down my extrovert ten-
dency. He’s able enough to cope on his
own.”
However, on with today’s “Girl
Talk.” What have we got? Monica
lowers her gladioli and says there’s a
Merle Oberon film clip, so don’t bother
with viewers’ letters, they’ve got two
guests and that should be enough. Miss
Phillips wants to mention a viewer who
sent her mum flowers all the way to
England. This touches her, more than
anything that’s happened in a long
time. It’s things like this that restore
her faith in human kindness.
There is no more preparation for the
program. When Hazel Phillips appears
on “Girl Talk” she has met her two
guests for perhaps two minutes before-
hand. This, she says, adds to the spon-
taneity, the idea being that all viewers
identify themselves with her. Recently,
to show how like them she was, she
appeared on camera devoid of make-up.
“I nearly died when I saw my face
on the monitor, but I wanted to show
I was ordinary, like them, and that
all I had was the technique of putting
on layers of make-up in the right
place.” She received 500 letters, ten
times the normal mail, saying now the
last barrier was down the viewers felt
more pro-Haze than ever.
So, with 15 minutes to go, the girl
who is just like them transforms herself
as she did that day, pats on the face-
shaper, the Max Factor base, four
layers of lipstick, brushes out the
Tress switch and plaits it round her
head. She digs into a jewel box with
her name burnt on the lid and puts
on some long earrings. The mums love
to see her in dingle-dangles.
The studio staff is waiting. Hazel,
gosh, you look gorgeous, says the floor
manager. Aw, get on wiv yer! Actually
Miss Phillips doesn’t really feel like
it today, what she wants is a cupper.
Her two guests, smiling stiffly in their
studio make-up, sip tea from heavy
gold pottery cups and listen to every-
one being outrageous. No, Haze hasn’t
got a baby, she’s run out of husbands,
see, that is she lost one, divorced, he’s
a pet, though, and a baby right now
wouldn’t be convenient. Announcer
Graham Webb walks in wearing a
lightweight navy suit, his tie folded
in the newest chic way, unknotted and
stuck with a pin, lights a cigarette and
sits by the No Smoking sign to do
his presentation ... A film is trailing
to an end . . . “The Queen Bee backing
into honey pollen to lay an egg . .
drones a solemn voice. “That was
b interesting,” says Webb, and
rocks laughing . . . Cue IN. Zonk! He
turns on his 1000-watt smile and says
they’ve got some really beaut things
coming on, they really have and
Here’s Hazel!
The daily performance over, Hazel
Phillips unwinds. At 37, the daughter of
a London taxi-cab driver, divorced, with
two teenage sons to bring up, and
potentially at any rate a star in Aus-
tralian television, she is confused about
the future. Actually, she says, she has
two sides: the teenage irresponsible one
that worries her a bit. She’ll fall in love
at the drop of a hat and then it’s all
over in three days, and the meaningful
yoga side, the meditation, which
brought her through the tragedies of
losing a child, a car crash, three plastic
surgery operations on her face, divorce,
and all the rest. On the one hand, medi-
tation seems the answer to her prob-
lems, makes her a better person, the
petty things of life are no longer dis-
turbing. On the other hand, it’s those
damned petty things that nowadays
keep her from meditation.
Barry Crocker puts his blond head


round the door. Hey, is Haze going to
do the Graham Webb thing at three-
thirty? Well, actually, Graham’s been
naughty, very, very naughty springing
this on her. You should have said no,
says Crocker. The trouble is, Hazel
can’t say no to anything. That’s her
difficulty. She can’t remember people’s
names, either, and this makes her ner-
vous. Crocker has the same trouble, and
can’t you tell, he says, on air? He is
also worried about his looks. Honey,
advises Miss Phillips, all you’ve go to
do is tell yourself you’re good looking
and you will be. It’s like telling your-
self you’re marvellous at something,
and you are! Crocker disappears with a
doubtful expression on his face,
She gets a better bunch of girls on
“Girl Talk” next day. There’s Desolie
from Berlei, and Mary from “Flair,”
and two pretty girls modelling girdles
and bras, and lots of chatter about fat
thighs and stomachs and drooping
bosoms. Haze gives a wicked wink to
the camera and giggles. “I wanted to
strip today, girls, "but Judy wouldn’t
let me . . .” All the same, she’s gonna
buy an orange girdle, bra, and slip to
match all the orange she loves wearing,
you know, then she’ll be orange from
the skin OUT . . .

Puritans in affluent America
By ELWYN LYNN
Two Decades of American Painting. Art
Gallery of N.S.W., Sydney.
TWO DECADES of American Paint-
ing, with 97 works by 34 celebrated
artists, pretty well indicates the nature
of the renaissance in 20th-century paint-
ing that began in New York in the
early ’forties with action-painting, which,
with cubism, is the second great move-
ment of this century.
This exhibition, which could hardly
be a slice of history, as some of the
great innovators are represented by
quite late works, is important in ways
not exhausted by the three lengthy
introductions in the catalogue. What
could not be discussed there is the
fact that here, with Pollock, Gorky,
Kline, and de Kooning, are works that
indirectly stirred Australian abstraction-
ists in the late ’fifties; and if locals were
bestirred belatedly, painters elsewhere
were, too. More important is that we
have a legion of great works to con-
front the local painting it has influenced
so widely, for even a jet trip back from
New York tends to diminish on one’s
memory the impact of American art.
Each painter goes after a masterpiece,
pushes his convictions to their extreme
expression, and sometimes, as Newman
avers, achieves the sublime: Tobey pre-
sents palpitating palimpsests with no
concessions to focal - point theory; if
Rauschenberg makes a combine of dis-
carded junk, it becomes an avalanche
of debris dragging action-painting brush-
strokes in its wake. True frontiersmen,
they act as though art was part of
Trotsky’s permanent revolution; some-
thing of the apocalyptic attitude of the
old Left lurks in them and Rosenberg,
a critic who sees the rejecting of socialist
realism as the Great Decision,
regards much of Pop, Op, and Hard-
Edge as a betrayal of action-painting
to the demands of the avant-garde
audience. But there is more coherence
between these works than he imagines,
not because, as Greenberg believes, that
all art tends to simplify, jettison im-
pedimenta, and breed off what was
essential in previous art, but because
of an underlying common spirit.
We haven’t much of an avant-garde
audience here, and let’s hope the
derriere-garde is not so chauvinistic as
that which has greeted U.S. art when
abroad since 1956; in London, John
Berger, when very much the Moscow
Marxist, saw in it America’s degenera-
tion; John Russell of the “Sunday
Times” has been slapping himself ever
since for saying that Pollocks’ hand-
marks on the canvas indicated who
should have been slapped. In January,
1959, when 58 Pollocks and 81 works
by other Americans were shown at
Paris’ Musee National d’Art Moderne,
Frenchmen stayed away in thousands to
prove Paris still the art centre.
Here, the Melbourne Press has had
its abusive, rapturous, and quaint letters
(“Long live modern art!” said one with
no time for conventional theories of
time). One writer compared her
reaction to her dog’s; it had barked at
a Mildura sculpture on behalf of man
and beast. A trio reminded all that Mel-
bourne laughed at Jean Shrimpton. One
of rare discernment saw the show as an
intellectual experience. Indeed, it is
hard to find the impassioned emotion-
alism of action-painting at all; it is the
abrasive intellectualism in these works
that marks it off from Australian paint-
ing, which has been inhibited by its
obsession with myths and experiences.
Laurie Thomas, on “Survey” in a ten-
minute chat, joined the masses in reject-
ing the intellectual implications of
Reinhardt’s three black works and
partially dismissed the Americans by
twice puffing the Aussies.
Meanwhile, Melbourne’s and Syd-
ney’s catalogues sold out and students
and teachers from Adelaide made the
pilgrimage; one facetious remark by
an Adelaide teacher, seeing a Rem-
brandt on the way out, sums up a lot of
reactions: “Rembrandt is very good at
eyeballs.”
Among misconceptions about U.S.
painting is that the color is lurid; a
lot glorify black; Kline, who has con-
fessed his admiration of the dark paint-
ers, like Velasquez and Goya, has black
thrusting against and being challenged
by whites; Motherwell is plainly
elegiac, D’Arcangelo has Margritte high-
ways tunnelling through dark forests;
even Francis, usually light and dashing,
hangs a veil of black smudges; and
Rauschenberg makes a gloom of collages
from silkscreens of newspapers’ “tough”
photographs. Reinhardt’s “black”
squares, where symmetrical crosses may
be detected, disconcerts those commen-
tators who find refuge in saying that
without Reinhardt’s verbal justifications
the works would be empty voids. They
are anti-tension, anti-color, anti-move-
ment, and anti-clue-supplying; they are
a little like what Marshal McLuhan
says of dark glasses; they conceal, but
invite involvement. As with the Puritan
ethic, one gives out, but holds back. In
any case, the velvety blacks don’t just
look black, but palpitate, repulse, and
attract. As did New York, Melbourne
roped them off.
Color as such is rarely used; in de
Kooning’s large woman the swirling,
pulpy reds help the pressure on the
frame (the same kind of expansion
occurs in Held’s expressive geometry and
with Poons’ intuitively scientific dots);
Hofmann is concerned with the push
and pull of pure color and Davis with
the vibrations of over one hundred
equal vertical stripes. Guston’s color is
that of a faded Impressionism and New-
man has said that it’s his scale, not the
color, that is the felt thing in his work.
Most of the color is subdued, veiled,
sour, neutral, or concerned more with
radiance than brilliance, as in Gottlieb’s
gloriously green Petaloid; it is surpris-
ingly veiled in Albers’ superimposed
squares; milky and vaporous in Rothko’s
clouds, where the power lies in the pro-
cess of diminishing energy; soft and im-
palpable in the two large works by
Louis, and fugitive in the entrancingly
unpredictable graffiti by Twombly; it’s
muted and a little sour even in Gorky;
it’s certainly uningratiating in Franken-
thaler’s luminous drifting stains, Katz’s
heads, de Kooning’s sick greens and
pinks, Warhol’s souped-up soup cans,
and Rosenquist’s faded commercial ad-
color; in Stella’s pale bronze cross and
in the huge Held a non-color is at
work.
The rejection of seductive color is
connected with an anxiety not to repeat
the allure of others; but these painters
are mainly anxious about the inventive-
ness and validity of their forms, and
Focillon’s La Vie des Formes could
be their primer. It applies to the pop
artists as well as to Pollock’s swirling,
baroque search. Lichtenstein is not send-
ing up action-painting when he “paints”
a brush stroke, or Picasso when he does
a cloisonne - benday dot version of
that master; he is after new forms from
old shapes. It’s too far from Picasso to
be parody and too intent on form to
be satire. Warhol and Johns, too, found
that the best way to investigate form


was in the neutral commonplace, Johns
re-doing the map of North America in
kaleidoscopic action-paint and making
a beautiful off-white ghost of the U.S.
flag. Their public motifs are not from
the chic magazines: Rosenquist exploits
the most banal and Warhol the most
commonplace, traumatic newspaper
photographs, repeating them to mini-
mise the shock and emphasise the form.
Twombly and Rivers use hand-made
lettering as though to counteract the
emotional gesturalism of a Grace
Mitchell.
Despite John Berger, these are no
escapist works and must be among the
most anti-domestic paintings; some, as
Barnett Newman said of his own work
in 1948, seek the sublime, silent, ord-
ered, and above personal anguish to
modify Burke, a tranquillity tinged with
angst. Far from being works of the
affluent age, they exhibit much of the
Puritan spirit: the busy, public activity,
the reliance on chance in Pollock,
Kline, Rothko, etc., to find salvation;
the constant revolt against pre-ordained
modes; the replacement of the fanci-
fully decorative with the imaginative;
the notion that art is a public perform-
ance by one’s integrity; the confronta-
tion of the canvas without magico-
symbolical props and with the convic-
tion that in spontaneity lies the Straight
Way to fulfilment.
A number of these painters did grow
out of surrealism, but to avoid nostal-
gia, legends, memories and myths, and
surrealism’s ambiguous imagery turned,
like Still, to the non-shape, or, like
Johns, to the neutral form; this is
part of what constitutes the New York
movement, and though there are voices
in the land acclaiming individual works
and denouncing movements (like
acclaiming good works and rejecting
the prophets) it’s clear enough what
happens when, in the old Andersonian
sentence, one is picked up by a move-
ment, and how it may bring artists to
the realisation of their genius.
(Color reproductions of some of the
paintings in this exhibition will appear
in The Bulletin shortly.)
Music
Understated
By DAVID SALTER
Sydney Symphony Orchestra, con-
ductor Konstantin Iliev, soloist, John
Shirley-Quirk. Town Hall, Sydney.
IN A DIGNIFIED, economical manner
Comrade Iliev last week brought a
little old-fashioned musical discipline
to an orchestra which for the past fort-
night or so have been involved in de-
John Shirley-Quirk
cidedly undisciplined public utterances.
The Sydney Symphony played
Schubert, Malipiero, Bach, and Brahms
with a reserve that could have been
mistaken for unresponsiveness. But
this element seemed to form an impor-
tant part of Iliev’s conducting style.
Despite a full complement in the
Brahms, the orchestra at no stage pro-
duced an all-out fortissimo comparable
with that demanded by previous con-
ductors in performances of the same
work.
This tendency toward quietly reflec-
tive realisation was, however, welcome
in Ich habe genug, Bach’s Cantata No.
82. This was the first time I have heard
the S.S.O. perform Bach in an accept-
ably effective manner for over two
years. They accompanied with the
quiet smoothness and sympathy of an
experienced chamber orchestra. Only
some wobbly-legged playing in the oboe
obbligato and the infuriating ABC harp-
sichord (which, when it is heard, makes
a sound like lettuce leaves being slapped
against a window pane) blemished an
otherwise outstanding example of
skilful and sensitive accompaniment.
Liverpudlian John Shirley-Quirk sang
the solo part of the cantata with a
similar sense of calmness and control.
His diction and melodic flow blended
wonderfully with the gentle cushion
of sound provided by the orchestra, and
throughout the performance one was
almost hypnotised by the apparent
infinity of its lyrical progression.
After interval Brahms rumbled on
with all the tortured magnificence of
his First Symphony. Technically com-
petent and certainly free of any misin-
terpretations, this was, however, not a
wholly convincing performance. Every-
thing w 7 as in place sometimes too
obviously so—but often the vision
appeared slightly out of focus. Matters
of rehearsal time and the wearying
length of each subscription series could
easily have influenced this outcome, but,
nevertheless, much more could have
been made of the work than Iliev
seemed to find.
Films
A bit of a drag
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Grand Prix. Director, John Franken-
heimer.
10.30 p.m. Summer. Director, Jules
Dassin.
TODAY’S FASHIONABLE WORD oi
critical condemnation is “self-indul-
gent,” which seems to mean that the
director is obviously enjoying some-
thing the critic doesn’t happen to like.
Certainly in “Grand Prix” John Frank-
enheimer is indulging himself in a
passion for motor racing which I don’t
happen to share; but actually the racing
scenes are the best things in the film,
deafening, certainly, but at least that
spares you dialogue.
Frankenheimer’s films have always
been technically inventive but have
been based on satisfying intellectual
content. But not here; the script is
negligible (to be as polite as possible)
and the whole movie is a big, handsome,
glossy balloon full of nothing.
Frankenheimer’s enthusiasm for rac-
ing is sometimes infectious, and though
he’s given to repeating his effects, the
race sequences are often gripping and
excitingly photographed (Cinerama is,
of course, a perfect medium, though
the director’s use of a split screen is
overdone and a little distracting). But
unfortunately the movie has to get its
actors out of their cars and into a set
of the flabbiest, most cliche-sodden
stories since “The Best of Everything.”
Yves Montand and Brian Bedford
manage to breathe some life into their
roles, and the cast in general is capable,
with the exceptions of Antonio Sabato
and Francoise Flardy, a singularly grace-
less and untalented pair. See this if
you love motor racing, but take ear-
plugs—not for the roaring of unmuffled
exhausts but for the lines of the script.
“10.30 p.m. Summer” is so inflated
and overblown with self importance
and spurious profundity that the
dialogue sounds like an extended burp.
Based on a novel by Marguerite
Duras (who collaborated on the script,
so don’t feel too sorry for her), it is
about a husband and wife, their child,
and a woman friend who are benighted
by a storm in a small Spanish town
where the police are hunting a wife-
murderer. The alcoholic wife suspects
her husband of infidelity with the
friend, with whom she herself has a
Lesbian relationship. Just to ensure a
thoroughly happy hoi. she yields to a
romantic whim to help the murderer
escape.
In this farrago there’s never a hint
of a plausible human motive, and the
arty lines sound even sillier in Melina
Mercouri’s thick, gargling accent. Peter
Finch accepts the whole thing with
glum resignation; Romy Schneider at
least looks deliciously pretty.


Theatre
Henry's centenary
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Lawson. Oriel Gray. New Theatre-
Centre 63, Melbourne.
Trumbo. Bunney Brooke. 27A Centre,
South Yarra, Melbourne.
BEFORE THE LIGHTS started going-
out all over Eastern Europe in the
middle ’sos, New Theatre flourished in
its own premises in Flinders Street.
The theatre was dingy and cold but
marvellously atmospheric, and the
company of theatrical militants could
be relied to put on an enthusiastic
production of any play with a chip on
its shoulder. I once put it to one of
their stalwarts that they rename the
theatre the Iron Curtain, but before
they had time to seriously consider the
suggestion Khrushchev’s Twentieth
Congress speech had decimated their
numbers and brought a curtain of
despair dowm on their Flinders Street
stage. The theatre became, of all things,
a dance studio; probably Right Wing.
In 1963 the company rallied and
obtained a warehouse somewhere in a
maze of city lanes, which they called
Centre 63. Shades of Arnold Wesker’s
dream of a renaissance of the arts
based on trade unionism! Now to cele-
brate Lawson’s centenary they’ve
resurrected a 1943 opus by Oriel Gray
in which she dramatised six of his
stories.
Three of the stories are far beyond
the acting range of the cast members,
and fail miserably. The others, how-
ever, are sheer delight. Lawson’s
characters are played by blokes rather
than actors, men who naturally speak a
fairly fluent Strine. Their very unpro-
fessionalism gives their performances a
remarkably naturalistic, almost docu-
mentary, feeling. Despite sets which are
(to say the least) primitive, “Steelman
and Smith,” “Jones Alley,” and “The
Army” really come alive.
“Steelman and Smith” concerns two
men of the road. One a spieler, the
other a lovable, compliant mug. In Mr.
Peachum fashion, the spieler briefs the
mug on the finer points of begging and
points him farmward. The mug is a
good learner, and returns loaded down
with everything from consumption cure
to cast-off tweeds. Whereupon the
spieler strips him of his spoils and
delivers him a cynical and hilarious
lecture on morality.
“Jones Alley” is a poignant account
of how a push of larrikins help a very
respectable widow evade her wicked
landlord by a moonlight flit. “The
Army” is a Runyonesque piece concern-
ing the war of wills between a band of
“Salvos” and a bunch of drunks at a
particularly notorious bar, in which
mateship triumphs over Christian
soldiering.
A thought comes to mind. Why not
a series of Lawson dramatisations for
“Australian Playhouse”? Henry wrote
marvellous TV scripts.
Bunney Brooke is, of course, a pro-
digiously talented actress. One remem-
bers her roles in “The One Day of the
Year,” “Sister George,” and “Virginia
Woolf” with pleasure and respect. Now
she’s invested her savings in her own
children’s theatre. It is one of the
bravest of the brave theatrical ventures,
and deserves the support of parents.
The plays they’re a continuing series
concern a clown called Trumbo, and
are splendidly dressed, staged, and per-
formed. Each play runs for a little over
an hour just the right length for the
very young and is full of theatrical
tricks which delight the mini-patrons.
The theatre is in Cromwell Road, South
Yarra, behind a church of such horrific
ugliness that in itself it’s a test of faith.
Don’t be deterred.
Into a decline
By ROBERT WARD
Romulus. Durrenmatt. Sheridan, Ade-
laide.
DURRENMATT’S ROMULUS is the
last Roman Emperor of the West. As
the empire dissolves and the Goths
move down the Italian peninsula, he
spends his time breeding hens and
selling the Imperial art treasures.
Harassed court officials, his distraught
family, wounded couriers rush in and
out, but for Romulus absolute inaction
is the high political virtue. He believes
war is futile, that the idea of Rome’s
greatness is a nationalistic absurdity,
and that he deserves the title of “great”
because he alone realises that the
Imperium is less important than the
lives needed to maintain it.
Somewhere along the line, all this
becomes diffuse. Romulus argues that
nationalism has led to barbarism and
that the world is better off without
Rome, yet his inaction allows a new
barbarism to triumph. At this point one
remembers Durrenmatt writes in Ger-
man, but the clue amounts to little when
Romulus meets the leader of the Goths,
Odoaker, who is found to be similarly
pacific and also preoccupied with the
breeding of hens.
While the play’s ideas could hardly
be described as coherent, it is funny
enough, simply as an intelligent his-
torical farce. Zeno, the Emperor of the
Eastern Roman Empire, arrives seeking
asylum having suffered a coup d’etat ,
and Neil Lovett plays him as a lisping,
vague incompetent who is forced to
speak in elaborate Byzantine liturgical
accents by his court chamberlains, Sul-
phurides and Phorphoridos. The per-
formance sets a high standard. Roger
Marshman’s Romulus is gaunt and grey,
and I feel a little flat.
With a cast of 17, one would have
thought the play too big for the intimate
Sheridan Theatre, but Colin Ballan-
tyne’s direction moves and groups the
cast meaningfully and with definite
style.
Records
Verdi revival
By JOHN CARGHER
Luisa Miller (Verdi) Complete Opera.
Anna Moffo, Carlo Bergonzi, Shir-
ley Verrett, Cornell Mac Neil, Ezio
Flagello, Giorgio Tozzi; conducted by
Fausto Cleva; RCA LSC 8001 (B
discs).
THIS IS AMERICAN opera at its best;
the modern operatic scene is so domin-
ated by Anglo-Saxon voices that one is
almost surprised to note a solitary
Italian, Carlo Bergonzi, among the
principals. Adding injury to insult, it
is hard to imagine a modern Italian
cast equalling this performance. Though
Bergonzi is the best member of the
otherwise American cast, his excellence
in no way reflects on the high standard
of the others.
“Luisa Miller” is the ideal opera to
lure the adventurous off the narrow
path of “Trovatores,” “Rigolettos,” and
“Traviatas.” It has the requisite num-
ber of superb Verdi tunes and few, very
few, dull spots. Its neglect over the
years is hard to understand, and is prob-
ably long-standing due to the fact that
Luisa immediately preceded the Big
Three which miraculously appeared
within a two-year span, 1851-53. “Rigo-
letto” created a sensation by fore-
shadowing the death throes of the set
aria and the dramatic continuity of
verismo still more than a generation
away. “La Traviata” was a sensational
failure which turned into a popular
success which appears to be timeless.
“II Trovatore” was, oddly enough, more
popular at first than either, perhaps
because it returned to the tune-smithing
Verdi of “Nabucco,” “Ernani,” and
“Luisa Miller” eclipsing all three.
“Nabucco” has recently re-entered the
regular repertoire along with the for-
gotten operas of Donizetti and Bellini.
“Luisa Miller” should have no diffi-
culty in following suit.
The performance of the singers is
without exception first class and it
would be ungracious to carp. Cornell
Mac Neil’s occasional unsteadiness as the
father is greatly outweighed by some fine
singing in the more crucial passages.
Anna Moffo’s voice is theoretically too
light for the title role, but I defy anyone
to find fault with her performance.
Bergonzi is ideal and the two basses are
outstanding in minor roles. Arguments
as to dramatic interpretation may rage
about the young Negro mezzo Shirley
Verrett, but there can be no argument
as to the beauty of her voice, and her
great duet with Bergonzi is most satisfy-
ing. At this rate Miss Verrett will reach
major star status in record time.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Kennedy Round: The Brits are
not pleased with Australia
'TARIFF CUTTING can be a curious
business. One result of the Kennedy-
Round agreement to reduce them is that
Australia will increase its tariffs on $45
million -worth of British goods. It has
happened this way. When the British
agreed at Geneva to lower their general
tariffs, this automatically reduced the
preferences Britain gives to imports of
Australian goods. This meant that, on
a little more than 5 percent of Aus-
tralia’s exports to Britain (of which 65
percent get a preference), our tariff
preferences would be cut in half. The
biggest items that this would affect are
the $14.7 million of unwrought lead,
on which 7/6 a ton preference has been
removed altogether as all imports will
now be duty free, the $3.9 million of
canned peaches, where the preference
has been halved, as it has for the $3.4
million of raisins and sultanas, the $l.B
million of leather goods, the $2 million
of non-edible beef offal, the $2.2 million
or iron and steel, the $1.7 million of
canned beef, the $BOO,OOO of poker
machines and the $400,000 of image
projectors.
The Australian Government has taken
the view that since we are losing some
of our preferences in Britain we should
negotiate away some of Britain’s prefer-
ences here. There were two ways of
going about this, either reducing our
general tariffs to other countries so as
to reduce the benefit Britain would get
from its preferences, or else to leave
general tariffs where they were and
increase the British rate up to it. We’ve
done a bit of both.
On $l4l million of Australian
imports there will be general tariff
reductions, and in most instances these
will mean the substantial reduction or
elimination of the preference Britain
(and other Commonwealth countries
like Canada) has had here. The main
nation to benefit will be Japan, whose
competitive position against Britain will
improve in its Australian sales of steel
sheet and other shapes and sections,
motors, leather, cotton yarn, knitted
fabrics, and wire cables. In return,
Australia has got guaranteed access to
the Japanese market for some products
that are already free of duty and an
increase in its meat quota.
The British appear far from pleased
at the Australian response to their
tariff cuts and clearly consider that
Australia has over-reacted to measures
that are affecting only a small propor-
tion of Australian exports to Britain,
especially when there are still so many
preferences extended to Australian
goods in Britain (preferences which, by
the way, would be in jepoardy if Britain
joined the Common Market). For the
latest arrangements will only reduce
the proportion of Australian exports
to Britain that enjoy preferences from
65 percent to a little below 60 percent;
99 percent of them will continue to en-
ter Britain duty free.
But Australia’s response will mean
a reduction in the two-thirds of British
exports to Australia that entered duty
free and a significant cut in the 85
percent that enjoyed preferences. Yet
Britain is the only country in the
world which guarantees Australia a
fixed percentage share of her butter
market, which admits meat free of any
quantitative restriction and guarantees
a minimum price, which pays a guaran-
teed price for one third of her sugar
exports. None of these were affected by
the Kenndy Round. The Brits are not
pleased.
Stock Exchange
Freer advertising?
SOME OLD HEADS and hands shook
visibly in Melbourne last week when
one of the local stockbroking firms
called a Press conference to distribute
and dilate on a brochure addressed to
clients with compliments and a release
time on it. The subject and its treat-
ment were most apposite, not to say
admirable, and doubtless the London
Press, who also got it, were as pleased
to have it as The Bulletin. In our
experience, stockbrokers, proud of writ-
ten and even oral advice ostensibly
meant only for their clients, have in-
variably been more obtuse in their ways
of leaking it for general publication.
The very good reason for this is that
out and out advertising, except of the
name-rank-and-number variety, is
against stock exchange rules. This could
be the time for the S.E. committee
to have another look at the rules them-
Board of Trade’s Douglas Jay: unhappy
selves and bring the whole business of
stock exchange advertising out into the
open.
Ghana
Example for NZ
NO, IT WASN’T New Zealand which
devalued its currency last week; it was
Ghana (for the second time this year),
by 30 percent, making the value of
the cedi nmv 88 cents Australian. Both
countries have been in balance of pay-
ments trouble for a long time but their
methods of dealing with it have been
vastly different. Ghana has been open-
ing up its economy, cutting back public
spending and investment ruthlessly
after the excesses of the Nkrumah re-
gime, and has allowed unemployment
to rise to 10 percent to bring its domes-
tic economy into line with its external
circumstances.
All this and an improvement in the
price of cocoa, Ghana’s main export,
has impressed international financiers,
particularly those in the Paris Club,
who’ve been extra generous with aid
and loans this year. Now to help
stabilise the position comes consent
from the IMF to devalue again. This
has paved the way for further economic
liberalisation measures announced last
week, including the reduction of im-
port duties (in some cases their
abolition) and cuts in sales tax on most
basic consumer goods (such as meat,
fish, flour, rice,-milk, sugar, petrol, and
kerosine). One of the next steps is
going to be to allow foreign firms to
recruit profits and dividends for the
first time in five years. Now take what
New Zealand has been doing . . .


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The full 1966-67 wool selling
season, to June, yielded $709.26 million—the lowest proceeds
for five years, yet only $1.64 million beneath the 1965-66
season. Average greasy prices slipped back 2.70 cents a lb.
to 47.38 cents, but 176,922 extra bales were sold. Japan
bought some 35 percent of the whole offer.
The volume of rural production for 1966-67 should be
about 14 percent more than for the previous year, to give a
record gross value of $3733 million; current crop prospects
appear “generally good” . . . The N.S.W. Graziers’ Associa-
tion believes the Federal Government’s superphosphate
bounty should be increased, since recent price rises have
“completely eroded” existing bounty levels.
Imports of aluminium metal are to be banned for a further
four years.
The Commonwealth’s first 1967-68 cash loan carries the
same terms as the February and May loans; the Treasury has
established a new six months’ note.
For the markets: Industrials as a whole remained
quite strong on Australian share markets, despite a leader
withdrawal which brought the index back. Barrier miners
retreated as a body; other metals held up well.
Equities in London steadied after a decline imposed by
adverse June trade figures . . . Wall Street has seemed
rather mixed, yet managed an advance at the close.
For companies: The big guns were led in with CSR’s
report for 1966-67 (discussed in detail on page 54); directors
sound fairly satisfied with the physical, though not pricing,
state of the world sugar market, but cannot conceal their
apprehension at Britain’s possible entry into the EEC . . .
Conspicuous consumption did not help Rothmans, whose
1966- profits slumped 41 percent to $1,789,402, although
the second half earned “somewhat more than double that
for the first half”; dividend comes from 20 to 14 percent
with an 8 percent final.
To eliminate any shareholder uncertainty, textiler Davies,
Coop has declared an 8 percent final for 1966-67, mentioning
also an above budget profit and record turnover . . . The
Prestige hosiery group raised its latest turnover by 11.6 per-
cent to $33.14 million, including some “takeover” results.
Cadbury-Fry-Pascall has decided to make a second cash
and share (counter) bid for all confectioner Mac. Robertson’s
capital; it’s worth $2.15 a share and the rival Mars Inc. offer
is withdrawn.
Directors of Anderson Meat Industries predict a modest
1967- profit after losing about $BBl,OOO in the year to
July 2; that figure includes non-recurring items and losses
on now-disposed activities . . . All its various categories
helped Heinz Australia to lift earnings from $684,588 to
$821,178 on 21 percent better sales . . . Ballarat Brewing
intends to pay 11 percent after a one-for-three bonus; slightly
higher 1966-67 profits mean a 14 percent payout.
Miners marched in to the tune of Hamersley’s $3,149,000
profit for six months to June 30 and directors’ talk of faster
shipping rates in the second half . . . Consolidated Rutile’s
output continues to move ahead while directors keep quiet
on previously announced talks . . . Nickel indications near
Kambalda (W.A.) are revealed by Great Boulder Gold’s
sampling.
Financier General Credits achieved its latest profit
advance, 17 percent, despite a heavy drop by the insurance
subsidiary . . . Also Melbourne-based, Associated Securities
improved by 15 percent to $1,764,825, keeping the 16 per-
cent payment on higher capital.
MAN AND MATTERS
THE MAN IN CHARGE of Gallaher
International’s million-dollar do-or-die
last fling at the Australian cigarette
market is used to taking risks. Forty-
year-old Englishman Michael Moxey,
one of the Gallaher group’s British
troubleshooters (he has been managing
director of the Australian subsidiary for
the past six months), is a skilled para-
chutist with 50 jumps to his credit as
a result of a spell with the Special Air
Service in Britain. And there can be no
doubt of the risks involved (and the
rewards for success) in trying to win a
decent-sized slice of the Australian
cigarette market. He wants at least 8
percent; at present he has a tiny frac-
tion.
To add to the problems facing
Moxey, his rivals have set out on some
new promotions (like Churchman) just
at a time when he was to launch his
special effort. But there were no changes
of plans on that account. Like the racing
cars that feature in his advertisements,
the Moxey campaign for Gallaher GT
roared off at a breakneck pace, no
matter what the conditions. Last week
Gallaher introduced its two new
brands, the cheaper Park Drive pack in
the 33 cent bracket (after a trial run
in Brisbane) and the more prestigious
Gallaher GT at 40 cents. If these don’t
win the company a bigger slice of the
Australian market than the tiny share
it has achieved through its unimpres-
sive existing 40 cents performers, Gal-
laher Superfine and Edinburgh (and
the recently added and modestly suc-
cessful 35 cent Ski Menthol), then a
lot of people at Gallahers will be look-
ing for new jobs. r
Moxey, who got the Australian job
because of U.K. successes with this sort
of promotional campaign, is to spend
another million dollars on the GT pro-
motion. He sent a camera crew to film
motor races and motor factories in
Europe to give the “Gran Turismo”
impact to the advertising campaign in
an attempt to recoup the several mil-
lion already poured unsuccessfully into
this market by Gallaher. There is a lot
at stake in coming months for Moxey,
the Gallaher company’s first post-war
London trainee.
ONE TIME PRODUCTION mana-
ger of Turner and Newall, about the
biggest asbestos group in the world,
Professor John Willett, who was made
one of Melbourne University’s two Pro
Vice-Chancellors last week, is an
unusual bird of the academic species.
He flew in here from Britain with his
wife and family in 1963 to be Sydney
Myer Professor of Commerce and
Business Administration (the first
appointee to the chair). Far from nest-
ing cosily on the campus, Willett soon
became a familiar figure in Melbourne
business circles, as well as attracting
M. G. Moxey
Prof. F. Willett
some of its fresher cream to early morn-
ing (before offices open, that is) aca-
demic exercises in Carlton.
Of a strong business bent, Willett,
who was born in London, became
thoroughly indoctrinated with the
economic arts at Cambridge. After seven
years in the Navy, he went on to re-
search jobs, mainly on social aspects
of the U.K., the coalmining industry,
and management. He was director of
research and industrial management at
Cambridge when he got his chair in
Melbourne. Since arriving here he has
been enlisted for the councils of the
Australian Institute of Management
and several other community bodies, in-
cluding the Victorian Council of
Social Services, of which he is presi-
dent.


THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Hasten slowly
with the
Companies Acts
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IN TUNE WITH the times, the title
“Living with Legislation” chosen for
their winter lecture series by the com-
bined forces of secretaries and accoun-
tants in Melbourne is a fair reflection
of the business world’s anxiety over the
increasing intrusion of the State into
its affairs. With the emphasis of the
practical application of the law, three
speakers have been lined up to talk on
living with the Companies Act, the
taxation of trusts, and the Trade Prac-
tices Act, three of the most sensitive
areas at present.
Piecemeal amendments to company
law came under heavy fire last week
from leading company lawyer Mr. J.
Mclntosh Young, QC, in the first of
these. The point has been made in so
many places lately that it is to be
hoped the message eventually gets home
to the Attorneys-General committee now
brooding over a whole heap of pro-
posed amendments. Young’s uppermost
thought was that, if we have got to
have big changes in company law, let
there be an overall revision. Nobody
has put it more colorfully than him.
Emphasising that the worst time to
amend legislation to deal with what are
thought to be the causes of a company
failure is immediately after the event, he
continued, “inevitably the amendments
will be of the shutting-the-door-after-
the-horse-has-bolted variety; one danger
is that the wrong door will be shut, and,
in any case, the next horse will not bolt
out of the same door, even if it is
open.”
In hastening slowly toward better
company law in the past few years,
other Australian State governments have
been a deal wiser than Victoria’s, which,
after a string of company failures fol-
lowing the 1960 boom, rushed through
a series of amendments to its company
law to paste over holes exposed by
those failures. At least some of those
failures derived from the loopholes in
the Companies Acts before uniform
legislation was put through. It would
have been far better to have given the
1961 uniform Act a longer trial, say
at least five years, and then to have
had another full look at it, like the
Attorneys-General are now having. Most
company lawyers, including Mr. Young,
seem to agree with that.
As Young pointed out, the procedure
should be to have a full-scale examin-
ation of company legislation, followed
by a wholly revised Act. If this had
been done, it is far less likely that
anomalies would have been built into
the Act and also that particular situ-
ations would control the introduction
of general provisions.
One of Mr. Young’s worst fears is
that the As-G are going to line auditors
up as a species of public watchdogs.
His own view is that their responsibil-
ities should be confined to reporting to
the members of a company on its man-
agement. Already, auditors have been
pushed well beyond this and now have
responsibilities toward creditors as well
as members of companies. He regards
their new responsibilities, laid down in
the 1963 and 1966 Victorian Acts, as
representing “a remarkable change,”
because they cast auditors in a role
foreign to what was previously expected
of them. Echoing Sir Alexander Fitz-
gerald, he said the change derives from
the false notion that there is a book
of absolute accounting standards which
assumes that only the magic of an
auditor can reveal whether a particular
set of accounts gives a fair view. In
fact, as Fitzgerald has held stoutly over
the years, there is only a set of
accounting principles.
On the pitfalls still remaining for
investors after these new Acts, Mr.
Young set his sights on the continued
use of open-ended trust deeds and came
up with the unambiguous answer that
the practice should be stopped. He
thought that if, in view of the tremen-
dous commercial advantages such
deeds confer on borrowers, this was
considered too drastic, at least much
closer attention should be given to their
form and the powers they confer.
Apparently these deeds haven’t yet
come under the scrutiny of the
Attorneys-General committee. One of
the problems concerning them was, of
course, thrown up by the various series
of debenture stock issued by Reid
Murray Acceptance. But so far as
affecting the law on trust deeds goes,
it was dealt with as a special case in
an Act legalising the scheme of arrange-
ment of Reid Murray Acceptance last
year. Although Mr. Young was talking
about this type of fish, he was also
casting his net much wider.
The classic victim of the open-ended
type of trust deed is the State Super-
annuation Board of N.S.W., which, in
1964 in a case which went to the
full High Court, failed to establish the
security of debentures it subscribed to
in Stanhill Consolidated. The court’s
reasons were that the trustee wasn’t
informed that the issue was being
made and that the necessary certificate
attesting the assets-cover wasn’t issued
by the auditor. In fact, the Board
didn’t have a legal leg to stand on.
Mr. Young was concerned to show that
the pitfalls are much wider than re-
vealed in that case. For instance, he
said the most assiduous efforts by pros-
pective subscribers to such issues of
stock are unlikely to establish for cer-
tain whether the stock, when issued,
will be validly issued or that it will
confer a valid security.
That is true enough, and, though it
is most unlikely that any potential
subscriber would try to establish for
himself the facts as stated in a pros-
pectus, he is entitled to the best pro-
tection the law can give him that
they are true. However, Mr. Young
seems to be in entirely different coun-
try in condemning open-ended trusts
on the count that certification by
auditors can, by the nature of things,
only relate to past situations; that the
day after an issue of a certificate the
assets cover can change very rapidly.
Although Mr. Young sees this as
happening specifically with stock
issued under open-ended trust deeds,
it would by no means be impossible
for a company issuing fixed-interest
stock to issue some on Monday which
was validly issued, to issue stock on
Tuesday which was invalidly issued,
because the borrowing ratio turned out
later to have been temporarily ex-
ceeded, and to issue further stock on
Wednesday which was again validly
issued because the receipt of further
funds enabled the company to borrow
further. In this kind of situation the
certificates issued to the holders of the
stock on the three days would in each
case be similar, and there would be
nothing on the face of the certificate to
inform the holder whether the stock
referred to in it was secured or not.
Moreover, the holder of the stock issued
on Tuesday might not be able to find
out until months later whether on Tues-
day the borrowing limit was exceeded.
The root of the matter seems to be
that it is unavoidable that, whatever
the type or form of trust deed backing
an issue of any fixed-interest stock,
the picture of assets cover has to relate
to the past, and, for practical purposes,
can never be projected from day to
day in the immediate present to satisfy
the conditions on which the validity
and security of an issue rests. If the
law ever gets round to insisting that
such a picture be presented on a day-
to-day basis for open-ended trust deed
issues, it would only be a short step
to apply the insistence to other fixed-
interest issues.
As Mr. Colin Harper, of AUC,
pointed out in Canberra a few months
back, it admittedly takes far too long to
get fixed issues of any sorts into the
shop window, and the information is
sometimes stale indeed. But I would
imagine that the frequent reports now
required to be sent by auditors to
trustees, and the trustees’ powers to
make inquiries at any time are about
as far as w'e need go to protect the
holders of all issues made under trust
deeds, including the open-ended ones.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
But is the North really
worth developing?
By BRUCE DAVIDSON
ANY PLEA THAT it is worth develop-
ing Australia’s north-western region as
part of a national policy of decentralisa-
tion can only be supported if it can be
demonstrated that decentralisation is
desirable and that it could not be
carried out in some other region at
lower cost. Alex Kerr, in his book “Aus-
tralia’s North West,” fails to establish
either of these points.
It is difficult to accept Mr. Kerr’s
argument that the State should aid de-
velopment in these regions by reduced
taxation and by making other conces-
sions to the population. Such a proce-
dure is only justified if it is argued that
these concessions are needed in the
initial stages of development and can
be dispensed with at a later date. There
is little point in developing the region
if it has to be continually subsidised by
the remainder of the country. As the
author suggests, the need for subsidies
may disappear when the region supports
a large population, but the question of
how large this population would need
to be is not discussed. It is pointed out
that when the Ord River scheme is com-
pleted it will support a population of
10,000 people. Darwin has a popula-
tion of 10,000 people at present, and
the cost of living is just as high as on
the Ord.
But while one may quarrel with Mr.
Kerr’s conclusions and predications, his
book states precisely and accurately the
present state of development in north-
western Australia and is a useful addi-
tion to the literature dealing with Aus-
tralia’s tropical areas.
The author is cautious when he dis-
cusses the economic possibilities of the
region. He realises that a great deal de-
pends on future technical advances and
the amount of capital the Common-
wealth Government is prepared to in-
vest in the region. He clearly recognises
the tremendous disadvantages which
isolation and the harsh environment im-
pose on development. The high cost of
living in the area and the huge distances
over which communications must be
established are fully discussed.
In spite of these disadvantages, the
author concludes that the area can be
developed within the existing economic
structure. He considers that revenue
obtained from cattle in the area will
increase with increasing beef prices, and
that the Ord River pilot scheme has
demonstrated that irrigated cotton can
be produced economically in the area.
This latter conclusion is based on the
large decline in the cost per lb. of lint
produced in 1965 compared with 1964.
In 1965 yields rose rapidly, while costs
did not increase proportionately. The
author considered that this trend would
continue. It is unfortunate that “Aus-
tralia’s North West” went to press be-
fore the results of the 1966 crop were
available. These indicated that, although
crop yields were higher in 1966 than in
1965, costs rose almost as much and the
cost per lb. of producing lint in 1966
was similar to that in 1965. This is the
weakest part of the author’s discussion.
Although he discusses fully the argu-
ments of those favoring and opposing
the completion of the Ord River
scheme and gives details of the re-
turns obtained by farmers in 1964 and
1965, he fails to point out that at pre-
sent the scheme could not exist with-
out the cotton bounty paid by the
Commonwealth Government. The same
conclusion is drawn if one examines
the recently published results of the
1966 cotton crop. While the author
discusses the commercial production
of rice at Camballin on the Fitzroy
River he gives no details of the areas
of rice growm or of the profits or
losses incurred. This omission is un-
fortunate as this scheme, like the Ord
River pilot scheme, should be regarded
as a guide to the economic potential
of the area.
Like most other people, Mr. Kerr
clearly recognises that the immediate
future of the area depends on the
development of the mineral- and oil-
extracting industries.
In “Australia’s North West,” Alex
Kerr has collected together the available
statistics dealing with the section of
Western Australia lying north of the
26th parallel of latitude. The book has
been published at an opportune time
because of the recent interest in mineral
and irrigation developments in the area.
Most of the statistics are summaries of
those collected by the Australian Bureau
of Census and Statistics or by other
government departments, but where
additional material is available from in-
dependent surveys it has been included.
The region is described in a series of
chapters covering its major industries:
cattle, sheep, mining, cotton growing,
and fishing. Additional chapters deal
with water conservation, transport, and
the future development of the region.
The appropriate statistical tables are
attached to each chapter and reasons
for changes in the statistics and possible
future changes are described in the
chapter. A useful summary of the physi-
cal environment is contained in a 100-
page appendix. Any person or organisa-
tion requiring factual information about
Australia’s north-west will find this book
extremely valuable.
Northern Australia exercises a pecu-
liar fascination for the population of
the nation’s southern cities because it
is remote and unknown. The lack of
knowledge concerning its physical and
economic characteristics has led to many
speculative and conflicting opinions on
its future role in Australian develop-
ment. Any work which supplies accur-
ate data concerning this region will
be welcomed by the Australian public
and by politicians and investors who
are directly concerned with the develop-
ment of tropical Australia.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
A plunge into
the miners
at long last
THIS WEEK I’ve decided to go basic
and to have a shot at the mining
market. Black gold (beach sand to the
uninitiated) and oil (or at least the
prospects of it) were the fields I chose.
The saga of the Australian beach
sand industry is not unlike the success
story of the ruffian from the wrong side
of the tracks becoming the respected
and revered judge. In its teething days
of thirty years ago, and in its turbulent
youth of not so many years ago, the
industry was rife with fly-by-night oper-
ators and wildly volatile prices. Invest-
ment in it was about as risky as Rus-
sian roulette. It was not until the ’sixties
that any real rationalisation or orderly
conduct began to surface. Now, however,
like the judge, the industry is regarded
as being a responsible and respectable
member of the community. Today the
industry has a yearly turnover of around
$3O million and its export earnings
represent 10 percent of the country’s
mineral receipts. It is a favorite in the
Government camp and is pampered by
it to the extent that it only has to pay
tax on 80 percent of its earnings.
The main beach sands are rutile and
ilmenite. They are both sought for
their titanium dioxide content, of which
Australian rutile contains about 96 per-
cent and ilmenite 50 percent. The
titanium dioxide is in turn used in mak-
ing paint and for satisfying the world’s
apparently insatible appetite for
titanium metal. This superman metal is
stronger than most steels, while being
only half the weight; it is more heat
resistant than aluminium and less cor-
rosive than stainless steel. It is in big
demand for spacecraft, aircraft, and
outer-space equipment. The expanding
growth for the metal is evidenced by
the fact that two fabricators in the
U.S. are currently spending over $lOO
million on gearing up their production
for the metal.
All in all the industry looks ready for
big things. I decided to tag along for a
while and bought 200 Western Titanium
as my ticket. This company is Aus-
tralia’s . largest producer of ilmenite.
Operations are centred at Capel, 135
miles south of Perth, in Western Aus-
tralia. Its special appeal to me is that
it looks as though it may have developd
a commercial process for upgrading
its ilmenite (that is, increasing the
titanium dioxide content from 50 per-
cent to an appreciably higher percent-
age). If the process does prove a suc-
cess, and early tests have indicated this
then the company’s ilmenite will be a
much more economic proposition to
producers than rutile. If the process is
not a success, the company is doing
very well, anyway, and directors have
already predicted increased production,
with contracted prices not less than
those of 1966/67 for the current year.
Both ways the stock looks a proposi-
tion.
The other stock which looked a
proposition this week got away from
me. The company was Oil Search and
the price of the shares shot up while
I was muddling around and phoning
up my broker. I first noticed the stock
at 12 cents, went to buy it at 14 cents,
but found it was at 17 cents by the
time I got around to it. I initially
chose the stock because it was an old
hand at the oil game (it’s been round
since 1929) and must surely be well
experienced, its price was near the
year’s low, and it had a very healthy
turnover rate. Also it is now involved
in a rather interesting deal with Esso
Corporation, which, as we all know,
covered itself in oil and glory at Bass
Strait. The deal involves Esso spending
$6 million on exploration and drilling
four wells on Oil Search properties in
Papua. Oil Search is entitled under
the arrangements to 35.5 percent
interest on any profits coming from the
venture. On this basis I thought the
stock was a fair punt. Apparently so
did lots of others who, unfortunately,
acted a bit faster than I did.
I did, however, manage to make up
some of the profits I missed on Oil
Search with James Wallace. When the
company announced it had sold off an
engineering and hardware subsidiary
to help redeem some of its debentures,
the market was impressed enough to
push its price along to 26 cents. At this
juncture I was impressed enough with
my ex-brokerage profit of $lO7 to get
out.

Candidates in the dividend test
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
IT’S DIVIDENDS that matter. It is all
very well buying shares in the hope
that they will enjoy “growth.” But the
basis of it all is whether or not an
investor will get, at some time or
another, some good dividends. So the
coming profit “season” over the next
three months or so when companies will
report their results for the year (and
announce their dividend rates) should
see some degree of speculation about
what those dividends are going to be.
What companies are likely to lift their
rates of payout? It is not good enough
simply to pick out those that probably
improved their profits; there has to be
something extra to prompt the payment
of a higher dividend (either directly,
or in the form of bonus shares that
entitle the holder to more dividends),
Two categories stand out among the
companies that could be more generous
to their shareholders this year (when
profits generally could be expected to
have risen). One is that group of com-
panies that were forced to reduce their
dividend rates a year or so ago and
which presumably would like to restore
them at the first opportunity. The
other is made up of companies which
already earn profits to cover the divi-
dend charge by more than twice and
which could already afford to raise their
rates. The addition of a healthy profit
to these could encourage higher divi-
dends just to keep the shareholders
from getting restless.
There are some interesting candidates
in the first category of those that have
recently been forced to reduce their
dividends. A stock like Custom Credit
seems well able to do something about
restoring the status it lost when it
chopped its dividend from 15 percent,
and then 12| percent to a bare 10 per-
cent. Another that could be kept in
mind for future reference if it can’t
manage it this time is Dunlop Rubber,
whose old 10 percent rate would have
been beyond it last year but which may
have been able to earn better than
8 percent in the latest year.
Electronic Industries has had a bad
trot; its 7 percent dividend of last year
should be covered by better looking
profits this year. But it may take a
little time to get back to its old 10
percent, let alone its earlier 12-| percent
rate. Others in this category that may
be concentrating more on holding their
dividends than restoring them to past
glories include Ampol, H. C. Sleigh,
CIG, Drug Houses, and Adelaide
Steam. But they must be candidates
sooner or later.
There are several large companies
that had higher dividend rates before
making capital adjustments some years
ago, but which may be aiming to get
back to their old rates. Some of these
are also in the category of already hav-
ing better than a double earnings cover
for their dividends, so the prospects of
some benefit look quite impressive. For
instance, ACI earned at twice its 10
per cent dividend rate in 1965-66, and
back in 1961 it used to have a
per cent dividend rate. Its profits and
prospects seem healthy enough to justify
a return to that sooner or later. Mauri
Brothers earned more than twice what
was then its 10 percent dividend last
year; this year it has already increased
its interim to a percent rate, which
is still below the 11 percent it paid in
1964.
The mighty Myers covered its \l\
percent dividend more than twice last
year; in view of the big rise that is
sure to come in profits, it could easily
restore the 1960 rate of 18J percent (or
do something even nicer). Swan Brew-
ing used to pay 15 instead of the cur-
rent 13 percent; ICIANZ is now only
at percent the chemical tariff
should jolt it back toward the old 10
percent rate; Humes had a 14 percent
payout, now it is down to percent.
And once upon a time Coles paid out
11 2-3 instead of 11.
In the second category of those with
high dividend cover already and which
The Chartist says:
Investors holding UNITED TELECASTERS should view the recent rise in the
share price with considerable optimism. After listing in 1963, prices rose to a high
of $1.55 until the early part of 1964, when a downtrend eventually took prices to a
low point of 26c late in 1966. The steep rise to 55c during the past week has broken
the major downtrend, and although some short-term reaction is likely, the present
base consolidation suggests an eventual recovery to approximately the $l.OO level.

THE WAY HAMERSLEY IRON has
been going, its prospectus forecast of
a $22 million profit by 1970 (when it
is to pay its first dividends) is begin-
ning to look a bit on the conservative
side. Last week’s quarterly report for
the three months to June showed that
even w'hen the production rate was
only at about the 5.6 million tons a year
rate (compared with the 10 million tons
a year ore and pellet target of 1972),
profits were already up to $1.85 per
ton of ore shipped.
So it seems that Hamersley will be
able to do a lot better than $2 a ton
on average (particularly as the latest
figures included some tonnages of lower
grade iron ore at lower prices that
were shipped for the first time). True,
there will be a tax bill eventually that
will cut off some of the profitability.
But the near-doubling that is to come in
the rate of mining and crushing should
bring significant per-ton cost savings
that seem to suggest the profit rate per
ton may eventually end up closer to
$3 than to $2.
The latest profit figures do not relajte
to the ore crushed and delivered To
stockpiles, which exceeded by 46 per-
cent the amount of 934,298 tons actu-
ally shipped during the June quarter.
This earned a profit of $1,733,000.
Since the amount of ore shipped dur-
ing the second half of 1967 is expected
to be “significantly higher” than that
shipped in the first half (barring un-
foreseen circumstances like railway
problems), profits should continue to
rise sharply for the remaining quarters
of this year.
In addition, the company’s capacity
to ship ore is now being expanded to
10 million tons a year, and should be
reached in the second half of next
year (the prospectus expected the 10
million tons mark to be reached in
1972, not 1968). And the two million
ton pellet plant is also going ahead
and is expected to be ready in time for
its scheduled operating date next April.
THE 15 PERCENT price rise in local
sugar sales may be good for CSR, but
it is having its effect on other com-
panies that are sugar consumers. Jam-
maker Henry Jones seems the worst
off, as the higher sugar price came at
a time when apple exports w'ere posing
their usual problems and when tariff
protection afforded its canned fruit ex-
ports to Britain is to be cut in half,
so leaving the British market more
accessible to cut-price U.S. exports.
Soft drink makers like Schweppes
and Tarax have decided to pass the
rise on to consumers by increasing the
price of their product by adding 1 cent
to the price of all bottles of soft drink.
This, the first rise for two years, will
also restore some of the profit margins
eroded by higher costs during that
period and should give a useful nudge
to profits.
THE NEWS FROM Amax (American
Metal Climax Inc. of New York) that
it had bought out Wormald Bros,
minority interest in the fast expanding
(but still losing) aluminium fabricating-
company they jointly owned (Kawneer
Co.) has major significance for the
local aluminium industry (apart from
providing the hard-pressed Wormald
group w r ith some handy cash). For
Amax is understood to have an interest
in a major bauxite area in Western
Australia and the company is known to
be keen to develop its local interests.
WHEN OUR MINING WRITER was
adding the sum of the parts of CRA
(8., July 8) he made an error
in that the nickel strike at Widgie-
moolha added $230 to the value of 100
CRA shares, not $23 as stated. This
makes CRA shares even more reason-
ably priced, but does not change the
suggestion that purchase of the several
other companies mentioned may be
more interesting than the same funds
invested in CRA.
The Melbourne Market
Heartening talk at
Davies Coop
LAST WEEK’S profit and dividend
announcement from Davies Coop lifted
the shares only two cents to 37 cents.
While not blaming the market for its
lack of enthusiasm over the 50 cent
units, it does seem that the scrip will
see a much higher price within the next
few months. The eight percent dividend
which the group declared for 1966-67
leaves the shares yielding percent
after brokerage on the current market
price. This is a good return in anyone’s
language, and it does not take much
perception to see that directors will be
doing their utmost to maintain the pay-
out in future.
The most heartening point of the
announcement was the indication that
pre-tax profits for 1966-67 would be in
excess of the predictions made by the
board when the battle for Viyella was
at its height. Many market pundits
secretly scoffed at these predictions;
their achievement in the latest year
leaves no reason to suspect that targets
will not be met in future. Failure to do
this would have almost certainly led to
a cut in the eight percent dividend. As
it is, earning rate for 1966-67 will prob-
ably be only seven percent. Directors

predict a rate of about 11.4 percent in
the current year.
The conclusion is that Davies Coop
is finally coming out of the woods. An
investor can get a high return on his
funds while awaiting the final emerg-
ence. Once the fate of the four million-
odd shares the board has to dispose of
is decided (and any subsequent selling
pressure on the market), there is little
reason why the shares should not start
moving toward par.
AT 90 CENTS CONNOR SHEA
shares seem interesting buying for the
medium to long term. Last week’s
announcement that the management
had brought the previously ailing
Cranvel group back on to a profitable
trading basis augurs well for the
future. The Cranvel business, making-
industrial and earth-moving equipment,
should fit in nicely with Connor’s agri-
cultural equipment making activities,
to make the group as a whole strong
and formidable in its field.
It seems fairly certain that Connor
Shea will restore 10 percent dividends
this year, so the dividend yield on
current market prices is a not unattrac-
tive percent. Profit should top the
record 1964-65 $250,000-odd hand-
somely for the latest year to June 30
(results will be announced in Sep-
tember) and earning rate will probably
provide about double cover for the
restored dividend on capital increased
by the Cranvel takeover.
The main advantage of the takeover
will be to make the group less prone
to fluctuations stemming from the for-
tunes of the rural sector. This factor
alone should bring better market sup-
port for the shares than in the past,
especially when added to the fact that
Connor’s management has made the
company extremely resilient to seasonal
conditions; although profits fell by
something like 60 percent in 1965-66
they have apparently bounced back
with a vengeance this year to more than
recover the ground lost. With a good
earning rate and a view to expansion
in the boardroom, medium- to long-
term investors should see a share issue
some time in the future.
CAMELEC, the South Australian
manufacturer of electric cables, should
prove sound buying at anything up to
(but not much beyond) 60 cents. The
shares were fetching around 80 cents a
couple of years ago when the group was
earning about 15 percent on its capital.
It appears likely that this rate will be
regained in the current year. It is a
normal performance for the company,
but every now and then it slips, as in
1965-66, when only 7.7 percent was
earned. Directors have announced that
earning rate for 1966-67 will be more
than 11 percent it would have been
well over 15, but for the extra capital
to be serviced.
While the share price remains only
a little above par, the yield from the
10 percent dividend is attractive to
those awaiting the price increase which
should gradually accrue over the next
few months. Although S.A.-based, the
group is little affected by the relatively
poor economic conditions in that State,
because most of its business is done else-
where. The current year is reported to
have opened on a buoyant note, and
results will get the benefit of a full 12
months’ trading by the new Brisbane
subsidiary, Batten’s Electrical Pty. Ltd.
Only four months’ earnings from this
subsidiary were included in the 1966-
67 consolidated profit, up from $94,293
to $150,000.
WHILE THE LEADERS have been
getting most of the limelight in the
industrial share market, there is plenty
of activity going on at the lower end
of the scale. There’s been a lot of
interest in Southern Cross shares over
the past three or four weeks. Turnovers
have been high and the price has been
moved up from 20 to 30 cents. It
reached 32 cents on one particularly
busy day last week. A 50 percent price
increase over such a short period is
unjustified under normal circumstances;
it indicates that there is an informed
and determined buyer in the market,
Who?
Although the group’s spastic perform-
ance since listing is rapidly becoming
less so, this is no reason for the in-
crease. The situation has been well
known for some time, and the chances
of a dividend from the group in the
near future would appear to be almost
nil. The answer may lie in takeover,
Such a move would be logical for any
of the international airlines, as they are
going to need somewhere to put their
passengers up once Tullamarine opens,
It is, of course, doubly logical for Pan
Am, who lease the hotel from Southern
Cross through Intercontinental Hotels,
a subsidiary. Pan Am is in a position to
see that the hotel is going to do much
better in the future (it does brilliantly
already, but Southern Cross does not, as
its rent barely covers interest on the
money it borrowed to build the place),
and no doubt feels the shares are good
buying while they remain below par,
even without a takeover in view,
This is, of course, all conjecture. But
something is going on. The nature of
Southern Cross and the substantial rise
in its share price make the company one
for speculators only.


Behind the balance sheets
CSR: still very much in sugar
IT IS MAINLY iron ore that has
pushed up the price of CSR by 30
percent in the last four months; every
time Hamersley Iron opens its mouth
about how good things are, people
start doing sums about CSR’s stake
in the rival Mt. Newman venture.
But CSR is beginning to look good
for other reasons. Not only are sugar
profits likely to be considerably
higher this year (with another cheer-
ful sugar note being Britain’s receed-
ing chances of getting into the Com-
mon Market), but at long last CSR’s
expensive diversifications into other in-
dustries seem to be beginning to pay
off. They almost offset last year’s dis-
mal sugar downturn, and should be a
big help toward bringing in a con-
siderably higher net profit for the
group in the current year.
Sales and profits were higher for
the building division, and CSR
Chemicals increased its sales and
profits. So sugar profits contributed
their lowest proportion ever, only 72
percent, or $9.2 million, out of the
group result of $12.8 million, com-
pared with 77 percent, or $9.9 million
out of $12.9 million, in the previous
year.
The result of all this is that CSR’s
subsidiaries now return about 6.5 per-
cent on the parent company’s invest-
ment, compared with 5.4 percent in the
previous year and against a return
of only 3.1 percent on the book value
of assets employed in CSR’s parent
company sugar operations. And then
there are the other things like bauxite
at Gove, which at last seems close to
getting off the ground. Investors can
get some indication of the profitability
of this sort of operation from the excel-
lent results that CRA’s Comalco Indus-
tries is already getting at Weipa.
But getting back to iron ore, the
sums generally show a fairly impressive
picture. It seems a fair guess that, if
everything goes well, CSR could be
entitled to something better than $5
million a year out of Mt. Newman in
net profits by 1974 with significant
benefits coming in well before that. So
iron ore could alone bring a 40 percent
lift to CSR’s profits within the next
seven years, with the first impact of a
million or so dollars probably being
felt in the 1969-70 accounts, and with
the figure rising progressively to reach
a plateau of around $6 million a year
in 1976. That is without taking into
account any additional iron ore export
contracts.
These “expected” further contracts
would be significant in profit terms,
since the Mt. Newman group is writing
off its investment over the existing ex-
port contracts; the proceeds of further
sales would not have to be diverted to
this purpose. This would be an impor-
tant factor in view of the loan capital
redemptions CSR’s member company
of the group faces in coming years.
Pilbara Iron, the 68 percent owned
CSR subsidiary which holds a 30 per-
cent interest in Mt. Newman, faces the
repayment of $25.7 million in deben-
ture stock between five and nine years
from now, and the redemption of $15.1
million from 1979 to 1983. But with
Pilbara’s stake in the gross revenue
from mining likely to be around the
$3O million mark by the time the first
repayments come due, there should be
plenty of cover left for healthy dividend
payments to its shareholders. The facts
of the Mt. Newman iron ore operation
are that the Japanese are to take 100
million tons of iron ore over 15 years or
so starting from 1969, and BHP is to
take 70 million tons. CSR does not have
anything to say about profitability of

the contracts, but with rival Hamers-
ley’s average already creeping up to-
ward the $2 a ton mark even before
peak shipment rates are reached, the
signposts for the bigger Mt. Newman
project seem fairly clear (with its added
volume helping to offset the higher
capital cost of the project in per ton
terms).
This month’s accounts show CSR
in much better shape than last year.
At last the steady fall in pre-tax
profit from the peak of $24.3 million
in 1964 to $18.7 million in 1966 has
been halted with a recovery to $19.4
million. And there is slightly less use
of taxation concessions, with tax as
a proportion of pre-tax profit rising
a little from 31 percent to 34 percent.
The company’s tax charge will con-
tinue to benefit from significant
investments in new plant and in the
Mt. Newman venture for some years.
(In the latest accounts, the company
was committed to $6.2 million in
capital expenditure against $9.1 mil-
lion in the previous year.)
The accounts suggest that CSR
should not face too many problems
in contributing its $11.4 million to
the share capital of Pilbara Iron, or
the $llO,OOO in debenture stock, as
it had already contributed $3.2 mil-
lion by the end of March and the
remaining $8.2 over the next two
years seems no difficulty to a com-
pany with a cash flow of around the
$24 million mark, as CSR’s should be
this year, and with a dividend com-
mitment of only S7J million. By
March 31 Pilbara Iron itself had
spent almost $4 million on Mt. New-
man and was still entirely owned by
CSR.
Things have been looking up for
the other (main) parts of CSR. Even
sugar looks like contributing more to
the company’s profits in 1967-68 than it
did in the year that ended in March.
For the $26.20 a ton (or 15 percent)
rise in the Australian wholesale sugar
price last month will probably mean
an extra $750,000 in net profit to
CSR (provided overseas shipments sell
at average rates no worse than last
year). For millers are entitled to one
third of the price rise, and last year
CSR milled 538,000 tons. Only about
a quarter of this year’s production looks
like being sold locally, so only about
a quarter of CSR’s milling will get the
benefit of higher prices. There is
every prospect that world prices will
get no worse (and possibly a bit better)
in the current year; CSR says that
last year’s “distressingly” low price
“was never justified by the supply and
demand situation” and considers this
situation has improved. The current
year could thus bring CSR a sugar
profit near $lO million—its biggest
since 1964, when it was up around the
$ll million mark—even without any
appreciable rise in world sugar prices.
There is no doubt about the poorer
return from sugar shown in the latest
accounts. Parent company trading
profits (which represent CSR’s Austra-
lian sugar operations) dropped by
$114,316 to only $7.3 million, despite
a 25 percent rise in raw sugar milled
from the 1965 record, and Fiji’s fell
by $600,000 to $1.9 million when its
production eased a little—all in all a
fall of close to $f million from sugar
(a fall which is to be made up this
year entirely by the Australian price
rise without any assistance from higher
world prices currently ruling or from
any increase in sugar production; CSR
forecasts this year its output should be
steady at around 520,000 tons in Aus-
tralia and up 46,000 tons to 350,000
tons in Fiji). The difficulties in the
local sugar industry in recent times are
underlined by the fall in CSR’s parent
company trading profits from $9.1 mil-
lion in 1963-64 to only $7.3 million in
1966-67, despite an almost 50 percent
rise in mill production during that
period.
But despite last year’s $| million fall
in net profit from CSR’s sugar opera-
tions, its group net profit dropped by
only $70,000, as its subsidiaries in other
industries staged a timely improve-
ment. This was despite a rise in the rate
of tax, as a slackening rate of capital
expenditure reduced the size of invest-

ment allowances. Yet it was investment
allowances that provided the biggest
single profit rise in the subsidiaries
CSR Chemicals.
It seems pretty clear that most of
last year’s non-sugar profit improvement
of more than $600,000 came from CSR
Chemicals, in which CSR has a 60 per-
cent holding. For the amount of income
due to minority interests in the
accounts jumped sharply by $265,934,
or more than 80 percent, to $586,376,
suggesting that CSRC’s net profit may
well have risen by at least $500,000
(and possibly $600,000 if the other
partly owned subsidiaries in the Brad-
ford Insulation group did not also have
such rapid profit rises). This would
mean that CSRC contributed at least
$300,000 of the CSR group’s non-sugar
profit rise, as the “moderate” increase
in pre-tax profit that directors noted for
CSRC appears to have been consider-
ably assisted by a lower tax provision
arising from investment allowances.
Following the Tariff Board’s chemi-
cal tariff decision, there seems every
prospect that CSRC will do even better
this year. Directors here reported that
the pressure from imports had been
“somewhat relieved” since the Tariff
Board’s report, and that the “support
values” had been successful in com-
bating dumping.
GSR’s OTHER subsidiaries appear to
have all done better last year, with
the gypsum products group being des-
cribed in the annual report as “operat-
ing well,” the vinyl flooring group hav-
ing increasing sales (but meeting severe
competition), and with the Bradford
Insulation group “continuing to grow.”
With business appearing to pick up a
little in the building industry from last
year’s “rather slack” levels, there are
prospects that sales and profits in this
section of CSR could continue last
year’s trend to higher levels.
But one reason for CSR’s $600,000
rise in non-sugar profits may have been
the reduction in the scope of subsidiary
operations during the year. Admittedly
the fact that the group’s hardboard
activities were hived off in January into
a 50-50 company with Associated Pulp
would have reduced profits a bit. But
the closure and sale of the blue asbestos
operation at Wittenoom last December
is a good sign for profits. And the
absence of this heavily losing proposi-
tion for all of the current year will
have an appreciable impact on profits.
Despite the addition of the Hard-
boards Australia partnership to the
CSR group’s half-owned investments
like Pyneboard (which was reported as
doing better) and Ready Mixed Con-
crete, the group’s income from these
investments rose by only 2 percent to
$2.16 million in 1966-67, which seems
a disappointing result. However, the
big new cement supply arrangements
RMC has made with Goliath may bring
some improvement to this figure in the
next accounts. Pyneboard still seems
to be making most of the pace in the
building board industry, but the rate of
growth in this 50-50 operation with
APM is naturally slowing down after
its initial rapid development.
Directors do not explain some signi-
ficant movements in balance sheet items
such as stocks, which fell $8 million,
or more than 20 percent, to $29.5 mil-
lion, or the huge $l2 million, or 27 per-
cent, rise in debtors. It seems likely
that changed sugar prices may have
accounted for the fall in stockholdings
and that an unexplained increase of $6
million in loans to “other debtors” may
be the result of handouts to cane-
farmers to help them over their bad
time before the price rise. This may
also be the reason the company’s bad
debts doubled to $252,000 last year,
which surely could have merited some
explanation in what is generally a much
more informative set of accounts than
in the past.
The latest improved profit prospect
is despite the fact that CSR is already
facing some of the servicing costs for
its heavy capital raising that has gone
into ventures like Pilbara Iron and the
Gove bauxite deposits that will not be
profitable for some years. In the latest
year, for instance, the company’s in-
terest bill jumped by $700,000 to $2.3
million on fixed-term borrowings of
almost $4O million. And, in addition,
bank overdraft jumped $5 million to
$12.3 million (financing about half
the jump in sundry debtoi's and sug-
gesting that CSR was acting a bit like
a bank to the sugar industry).
But all the brighter points about CSR
must be discounted to some extent be-
cause of the continued threat hanging
over the industry by the possible end
of the British Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement, under which 40 percent of
Australia’s sugar income (and about
66 percent of Fiji’s) is earned, particu-
larly if Britain gets into the Common
Market. For the negotiated price of
£stg43.lo a ton under this agreement
compares with world prices as low as
£stg,l2.s at one stage early this year
(they are now up around the £stg2o
mark).
True, there is the offsetting pros-
pect of a world sugar price agreement,
which could stabilise things at what
would promise to be a higher level
than the present free market price.
Then there are threats to sugar itself
from other sweetening agents (this in
turn can be offset to some extent by
the alternative uses to which sugar can
be put). But CSR is still very much
a sugar company; iron ore could help
provide enough non-sugar profits by the
early 1970 s to reduce sugar’s contribu-
tion to below half of the group’s income.
(And that is provided sugar earns no
more than $9-| to $lO million.) So
investors in this stock still have to
watch the sugar industry as closely as
they watch iron ore.

Security analysis
New Broken Hill seems to be
worth more than CRA
IN “THE SUM OF THE PARTS OF
CRA,” in The Bulletin’s July 8
Mining section, it was concluded that
more direct and worthwhile vehicles
of investment in the minerals industry
were available than the “omnibus
type” of investment offered by CRA.
The purpose of the present article is
to demonstrate the investment merits
of one of these “parts,” New Broken
Hill, in relation to CRA.
CRA has 79,438,993 issued 50c
shares worth a total of $668.9 million
at $8.42 per CRA share. When we
deduct from this overall market capita-
lisation of CRA the capitalisations
attributable to CRA’s interests in New
Broken Hill (32 percent, worth $36.7
million based on $7.84 per New Broken
Hill share); Hamersley (54 percent,
worth $295.9 million at $5.48); Mary
Kathleen Uranium (51 percent, worth
$12.8 million at $4.40), and Interstate
Oil (54 percent, worth $8.2 million at
$1.08), it is apparent that the market
capitalisation of CRA’s remaining
interests totals $315.3 million, or $3.97
per CRA share. (It will be appreci-
ated that it has been implicitly assumed
that the market “correctly” values each
listed company in which CRA has an
interest. This proposition is, of course,
in the case of New Broken Hill, being
challenged in this article.)
At this stage it is possible to compare
CRA and New BH. A critical factor
in this exercise is that New BH has
an issued capital of only 14,646,387 5/-
stg. (62.5 cents) shares, i.e., there are
5.42 times as many CRA shares on
issue as there are New BH shares. Both
companies operate silver/lead/zinc
mines at Broken Hill, N.S.W. Their
similarity in terms of value of output
and profitability may be judged from
the following figures:
1964 1965 1966

The basic difference is that CRA
mines ore that is relatively richer in
lead, whilst New Broken Hill mines
ore that is relatively richer in zinc. New
Broken Hill’s mine capacity is currently
one million tons of ore p.a. and ore
production should soon reach this rate.
Half of this production is to come from
the zinc rich “B” lode, which will
thereby conserve the company’s reserves
of higher grade lead ore, and cause the
average grade of ore mined to fall pro-
gressively to that of mine expectancy.
New Broken Hill recently commenced
work on the sinking of a new shaft into
the southern extensions of the known
ore-bodies. This shaft will cost $7 mil-
lion and will be in full operation by
1972. This major development project
is being undertaken as part of New
Broken Hill’s expanded production pro-
gram and will provide greater flexibility
for varying the proportions of lead and
zinc production if the market prices
for the two metals in the future should
require such action.
While New Broken Hill’s proven ore
reserves are equivalent to around six
years’ capacity production, it should be
remembered that in 1962 the ore
“expectancy” of the mine was 34 mil-
lion tons. (Nine years earlier the ore
expectancy was 31 million tons, and in
the meantime 5.4 million tons of ore
were mined.) Consequently, it would
appear to be conservative to value the
mines of CRA and New Broken Hill
on a similar basis. Thus, based on
CRA’s lead/zinc mining profit in 1966
of $6,468,000, equivalent to 8.14 cents
per CRA share, the mine is worth $1.22
per CRA share if earnings are capital-
ised at 15 times. This is equivalent to
$6.60 per New BH share.
CRA and New BH are also part-
ners in the Sulphide Corporation and
in exploration. In 1966 the lead/zinc
smelting and fertiliser activities of the
Sulphide Corporation (75 percent CRA
and 25 percent New BH) produced
profits equivalent to 1.7 cents per CRA
share. Using a price/earnings multiple
of ten, this indicates that the Sulphide
Corporation interest is worth 17 cents
per CRA share, and 30 cents per New
BH share.
On the important aspect of explora-
tion, far greater “leverage” is obtained
by New BH shareholders. From the
beginning of 1964 New BH joined
with the Zinc Corporation in mineral
exploration activities. In order to
acquire a one-third interest, New BH
paid a premium of $600,000 (charged
against its 1965 profits). By agreement
with the Zinc Corporation, the term of
the exploration-sharing arrangement
was extended for 20 years from the Ist
January, 1965.
The initial fruits of this joint ex-
ploration program were outlined in the
article last week on CRA. I estimated
that the Bougainville copper/gold
prospect could return at least $lO mil-
lion p.a.; providing CRA with a return
of $5 million p.a., equivalent to . 6.3
cents per share. Assuming an earnings

multiplier of ten, this would value the
Bougainville prospect at 63 cents per
CRA share, and $1.71 (2.71 times 63
cents) per New BH share. Similarly,
with respect to the Anaconda nickel
strike (in which CRA has a 26 l-3rd
percent interest and New BH a
13. l-3rd percent interest), I assumed
that at best it would be worth 60 cents
per CRA share, taking a. line through
the market valuation of Western Min-
ing’s nickel interests. This would be
equivalent to $1.62 per New BH share.
The foregoing indicates that the lead/
zinc mining activities of CRA and New
BH and their joint interests in the
Sulphide Corporation, the Bougainville
copper/gold prospect and the Anaconda
nickel strike are “worth” $2.62 per
CRA share and $10.23 per New BH
share. (In the case of CRA, in order to
“justify” its market price of $8.42, it is
therefore necessary to value CRA’s
remaining interests at $1.35 per share.
This would “require” annual total pro-
fits of almost $l6 million p.a., using an
earnings multiple of ten. In time, CRA’s

interests may produce such annual
profits.)
Whilst the foregoing calculations are
based on heroic assumptions, and
ignore the element of time in certain
instances, they do indicate the invest-
ment merits of New BH as compared
to CRA in fields of common interest.
These merits are accentuated by the fol-
lowing considerations:
1. No allowance has been made for
any future exploration discovery in
which New BH’s interest on a per
share basis is 2.71 times that of CRA.
2. There is a speculative element in
New BH since CRA could feasibly bid
for the shares it does not hold in this
company. This would be one possible
way of increasing the local equity in
CRA.
3. Once CRA’s local equity has been
doubled, the greater availability of CRA
shares could cause its share price to
tend to weaken somewhat.
4. New BH’s dividend yield, even
after the deduction of the 15 percent
withholding tax, is currently 4.1 percent
as compared with the 0.9 percent divi-
dend yield obtainable on CRA’s
shares.
In all the circumstances, then, it
would seem that if CRA is worth
around $8.50 per share New BH
should be worth over $lO per share.

Mining
Bismuth good for Peko
THE USUAF RUMORS of takeover
got under way recently when Peko rose
strongly over a period of five weeks
from $2.30 to nearly $3. On this, as
on earlier occasions, the rise was sup-
ported more by results of the com-
pany’s mining activities, rather than the
nebulous rumors. The recent testing
of a bulk sample of ore from Peko’s
new Juno mine, which was to be a
gold-rich operation, has shown that
the ore contains more value per ton
for its bismuth content than for the
gold for which it has been developed,
rich as that was.
The actual report was that a bulk
sample of ore from the 700 ft. level
was milled in a plant scale test to
determine metallurgical procedures
and the ability to produce a bulk
sample of typical flotation concentrates.
The ore treated assayed 49.2 dwts gold
per ton, 28 percent copper, 1.09 per-
cent bismuth, and some silver and
selenium. From the figures given, the
test was very satisfactory, as recovery
rates achieved were 96 percent for
gold, 90 percent for copper, and 82
percent for bismuth. The selenium
content was not determined.
The metal content of the concen-
trates produced from the 516 tons of
ore treated was 12480 z. of gold, 103 oz.
of silver, 1.3 tons of copper, and 4.6
tons of bismuth. The last of these
products seems small enough to be
insignificant, but at prices between $4
and $5 per pound, the Juno ore is
worth perhaps twice as much as it
would be on its gold content alone.
Perhaps, as mining proceeds, the bis-
muth content of the ore will fall and
the copper and gold grades will rise
to their ore reserve grades, which are
higher than those met in the sample.
(Ore reserve grades were stated at .6
percent copper against .28 percent in
the sample, and 60 dwts gold against
49.2 dwts in the sample.)
But it would certainly be to Peko’s
considerable profit if the bismuth con-
tent of the ore remains near the level
contained in the sample. For example,
the Peko mine itself produces copper
and gold having a value of about $2B
per ton of ore mined, without allowing
for realisation costs, and the Orlando
mine ore contains gold and copper
worth some $22 per ton. Although the
quality of the sample parcel of ore may
not be maintained in actual production,
it was a fairly good sized sample, and
the company has said that the flotation
concentrates produced were typical.
There are, then, grounds for reasonable
optimism. The values of the metal con-
tents of the parcel treated were (again
ignoring realisation costs) gold $75 per
ton of ore treated, copper $2.20 per ton
of ore, silver 30 cents per ton of ore,
and bismuth $BO to $lOO per ton of
ore treated. Realisation costs reduce the
amounts received by the company for
the concentrates it ships, but the figures
above provide a good basis for com-
parison with the existing Peko and
Orlando mines.
Bismuth is probably better known for
its association with the drug and cos-
metic industries than for its qualities as
a metal. However, it has some unique
qualities, not the least of which is its
ability to combine with metals like tin
and lead to produce an alloy with a
very low melting point. Hence it is
useful in the manufacture of automatic
fire-warning systems, sprinkler systems,
boiler blow holes, and electrical safety
fuses; it is also used in the manufacture
of atomic devices and radar equipment.
Bismuth is invariably found associated
with other metals such as tin and
tungsten, as well as copper, as is the
case with Peko, and other base metals.
At one time Australia was an important
producer of the metal, from the mines
worked for molybdenum/tungsten near
Wolfram Camp in north Queensland
during the years 1914 to 1918. But in
recent years annual production has been
less than 10001 b.
The output of the Juno mine may
match the quantities imported of the
metal in recent years, but will be ex-
ported in the concentrates shipped to
Japan under Peko’s contract with Sumi-
tomo Shoji Kaisha Fimited, which is
for the production of the Juno mine
for the next five years. Major world
producers of bismuth are Peru, the
U.S.A., Japan, Mexico, South Korea,
mainland China, Bolivia, and Canada;
production from these sources has been
rising in conjunction with higher out-
puts of associated metals, but consump-
tion, especially in the United States
has been increasing at a faster rate
and the ensuing supply gap has meant
a considerable price increase in the past
few years. After remaining unchanged
for ten years, prices rose slightly i n
1964 to $U.5.2.35 per lb. and by 1965
reached SU.S.4 per lb. Current quoted
prices are nominal only, but the local
price for bismuth metal is around the
$4.18 per lb. mark.
Peko’s production from the Juno mine
will consist of gold bullion and con-
centrates. The concentrates, to be
shipped to Japan, will contain gold,
copper, silver, bismuth, and will contain
some small but significant quantities of
selenium. This metal will also add to
the profitability of the mine, as it too
is of reasonable value. Prices are in
the vicinity of $4 to $6 per lb., depend-
ing on quality, and although there does
not appear to be any shortage, the
uses for selenium assure it of a good
future. The metal is used by the glass,
rubber, and plastics industries as well
as the cosmetic and explosives indus-
tries. Selenium is also used in the manu-
facture of electronic equipment, in
camera exposure meters, and in photo-
electric cells, as it conducts electricity
only when exposed to light.
Production from the Juno mine is ex-
pected to commence during October
this year. The ore will be trucked three
and a half miles to the mill at Peko
for concentration after crushing at the
mine site. Capital costs of developing
the mine are likely to be about
$1,500,000, perhaps less; development
of the Orlando orebody, which is of
similar size, cost $1.3 million, and the
Ivanhoe mine, which commenced pro-
duction in 1965, cost $1.17 million.
Both of these deposits were at about
the same depth as the Juno mine.
Establishment of the Juno mine will
mark another milestone in Peko’s steady
march forward from its initial, and
somewhat shaky, start in 1954, when it
was dependent on both high grades and
high prices. Since then it has brought
into production the Orlando mine,
which commenced production in 1962
after five years of testing and develop-
ment, and the Ivanhoe mine, which pro-
duced its first oi‘e in 1965, five and a
half years after drilling commenced in
1959. After the Juno mine will come
the Warrego mine. This mine will be
a major development for the company
as it is some distance (40-50 miles)
from the existing mill at Tennant
Creek and is of insufficient grade to
support the cartage of ore. Drilling
began in 1959 and full production^is
not planned before the end of 1971.
Some ore will be produced by the end
of 1969, and cost to that stage will be
about $3.5 million. Final cost of devel-
opment of this large low grade (2.6

percent) copper deposit will add a fur-
ther $6.3 million, to make a total of
almost $lO million.
Compared with the costs of the
mines established to date, such a large
amount may not be so frightening as
it appears. Over the past eight years
development costs of the Orlando,
Ivanhoe, and Juno mines will have
been about $3-| to $4 million, of which
the major part has been spent in the
past five years. Development of the
first stage of the Warrego mine will
involve expenditure at a rate consider-
ably higher than this. Peko has
financed the three previous mines from
its own resources, and appears to
intend doing the same with the War-
rego mine. The results of the Juno
test ore reinforce the company’s
ability to do this, and if the grades
are sustained in actual mining the
bismuth content of the Juno mine
could well be a material factor in
accelerating the development of the
Warrego property.
Commodities
Copper struggles
with substitutes
THE COMPETITION in the copper-
aluminium market is more like a riot
than a battle, said the New York
“Times” recently. For other participants
in the struggle include many metals,
as well as plastics, ceramics, and wood.
However, the copper-aluminium com-
petition is the most important, and the
most dangerous, for copper.
The three-year-long world shortage
of copper has almost certainly hastened
the switch to aluminium by many in-
dustries particularly for electrical
cable and wire. With copper now facing
several years of over-supply (barring
major political upsets in producer
nations) the aluminium-copper battle is
at an interesting stage. Will a more
assured supply slow down the trend
away from copper?
Apart from the electrical field, the
major market for copper is in plumbing
and other water-carrying uses, such as
car radiators. The huge quantities of
tubing required for new water de-salting
plants are an example of the balance
between the two metals.
There are two main copper alloys
applicable, one with 30 percent nickel
and the other 10 percent nickel (itself
currently passing through severe short-
age). These alloys have been shown cap-
able of handling salt water at 300 de-
grees, as will be required in de-salting
plants. The aluminium pipe, on the
other hand, has carried the liquid at
only 140 degrees, and then only in pilot
plants.
So aluminium, still a newcomer
among metals, again faces considerable
research costs. Although aluminium tub-
ing would need to be somewhat more
bulky than the copper-nickel equivalent,
for the same pressure-capacity, this is
balanced by the cost factor: even at
the low U.S. producer price copper is
50 percent dearer than aluminium.
In the next six years de-salting plants
could use 470 million lbs. of aluminium,
including sheet and plate as well as
tubing. The copper industry has esti-
mated that the next decade could see
400 million lbs. of copper used in tubing
alone for de-salting projects. And at
present copper-nickel is the favored
material. In this area, too, the
aluminium-copper battle would take on
some aspects of a riot if stainless steel
producers move in.
THE LONDON SUGAR market made
a recovery later last week after touch-
ing £l7§. About half of Australia’s
sugar production is sold at or near
free-market prices—a far higher pro-
portion than the average for sugar
nations.
There are two main considerations
in the sugar market at present a
bearish short-term and a bullish long-
term. Firstly, there has been an in-
crease in supplies held by dealers re-
flecting sales by several South Ameri-
can countries. This is an important
short-term factor at a time when the
market is lacking spirit and when stocks
are high.
But despite the present dull tone,
there continues a feeling that the
longer-term outlook is improving. The
balance between supply and demand
has improved considerably in recent
months. As free-market prices have
been below production costs for over
two years, this is not surprising. Stocks
have been reduced by several sales for
non-food use. But more definite statis-
tics will be needed before the free
market will take heart.
The pressure will finally come off
the Australian producer (and taxpayer)
only when a new international produc-
tion pact is agreed. There have still
been few real indications that Cuba’s
opposition to such a move has softened.
EUROPEAN PRODUCERS are evi-
dently undercutting the newly reduced
zinc price (£9B a ton). A cut of
£6-8 a ton had been expected on the
evidence of market conditions, and the
£4 reduction actually implemented has,
as a result, not been completely ac-
cepted. Even the production cuts pro-
gram is greeted sceptically.
For, although old (and so less profit-
able) plant is being closed, new cap-
acity continues to be added in several
countries. In West Germany a 125,000-
ton capacity increase is seen by 1968.
And in Australia, for instance, while
new capacity has not been added,
neither has old plant been closed.
All this means that the enlightened
actions of several major smelting
groups, notably RTZ in the U.K., may
not be sufficient to hold the producer
price, especially if economic conditions
in the U.S. do not pick up, as expected,
later this year.
A SHORTAGE OF LEAD in Japan is
providing Australia with an opportunity
for sales at a time when markets gener-
ally are depressed. A shortage of ore
is evidently part of the problem, with
imports this year not meeting smelter
capacity.

WE PLANT A TREE FOR YOU EVERY YEAR
Every year foresters of A.P.M. plant about 7
million trees one for every adult Australian
to help meet this country’s future paper
requirements. The 7 million trees planted by
the company in 1956 will be harvested in about
1985 to provide wood and wood products.
Since 1950 A.P.M.’s forestry company, A.P.M.
Forests Pty. Ltd., has planted about 48 million
trees on 69,000 acres of tree farms in Victoria,
Queensland and N.S.W. We are continuing to
plant ‘paper’ trees at a rate many times greater
than Australia’s growth in population.

THE LAND
Kennedy Round conflicts
By the RURAL EDITOR
THE AUSTRALIAN (official) view of
the Kennedy Round is well known. So
it is interesting to get another view from
another part of the world. The Execu-
tive Committee of the International
Federation of Agricultural Producers
met in Montreal in June to consider
and discuss the Kennedy Round and
its implications for agriculture.
IFAP represents farmer organisations
in most Western countries, although
Australia’s participation is under a cloud
due to the small matter of membership
fees. We are not sure whether we are
paid up or in the process of becoming
paid up. This does not matter much
here. It does matter that IFAP (like
so many international organisations) re-
lies heavily on United States support,
and while it represents many countries
it is possibly true to say that the U.S.
voice is the strong one. What is not
stated openly by the U.S. can some-
times be gleaned from international
organisations which would hardly exist
without U.S. money.
The following are straight extracts
from the now-published IFAP Executive
Committee report on the Kennedy
Round. “The committee regrets that the
Kennedy Round failed to evolve a new
and constructive pattern of international
negotiations on agriculture, although it
again demonstrated glaringly the limited
manner in which the general rules em-
bodied in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade apply to agriculture.
There has, in short, been no comprehen-
sive attempt at international co-ordina-
tion of national policies of agricultural
support and trade through international
commodity councils and agreements.
“In these circumstances the Executive
Committee of IFAP invites all member
organisations to pursue actively the
policy embodied in the reports of its
General Conferences and bring pressure
to bear on governments in order to
carry forward, through existing inter-
national agencies as well as ad hoc con-
ferences and international commodity
councils, efforts at a minimum amount
of understanding which should cover
the following points:
(1) An international cereals agreement
including, inter alia, reference to
the levels of production required to
achieve market balance and price
stability and to the levels of normal
carry-over positions, global and
related to individual countries.
(2) The setting up of an International
Dairy Council.
(3) Periodic consultations on the situa-
tion and outlook in world meat
trade leading to the co-ordinated
action required to ensure the
orderly development of the world
meat industry.
(4) Support to consultations and nego-
tiations on other commodities,
especially those of interest to the
developing nations, now mostly
carried forward in the United
Nations and other inter-govern-
mental framework.”
The IFAP Committee said it hoped
the Kennedy Round might pave the
way for an international wheat agree-
ment with important new provisions. If
there is any hammering out to be done
it will concern, we would say, Point 1
. . . “reference to levels of production
required to achieve market balance and
price stability.”
We would now draw attention to a
recent statement by Mr. J. W. C. Davis,
chairman of the Foreign Wheat Trade
Committee of the Great Plains in Den-
ver, Colorado. Mr. Davis expresses the
wheat-roots viewpoint of the American
farmer when he was quoted as saying
that the existing international wheat
agreement (to be discussed by the Inter-
national Wheat Council in Rome this
month) had not helped the U.S. farmer
to any great extent.
“Every country that signed the agree-
ment increased production, with the ex-
ception of the United States. The
American wheat farmer was never so
dissatisfied with his returns, even in the
depth of the depression, than he is to-
day. We don’t want to see an all-out
dog-eat-dog price war on the export
markets which would greatly affect
Canada and Australia and help nobody.
But Australia, Canada, Argentina,
France, and other exporters should join
together with the United States to ham-
mer out some plan to increase total
export outlets for wheat.”
“Hammering” seems to be a favorite
preoccupation with wheat negotiators
the world over. We would assume that
a big hammer drives a bigger nail than
a small one. Let the issue be clearly
understood. It has very little to do with
the wheat stabilisation system, as a sys-
tem, in Australia. Inevitably, however,
whenever anything like this appears in
print the Australian wheat establishment
cries that an attempt is being made to
subvert wheat stabilisation.
There are, goodness knows, reasons
enough why wheat stabilisation is open
to criticism, but this is not what this
particular article is about. In fact, there
is, in some sections of the U.S. wheat
world, an admiration for our system.
There the Government is a big buyer
of wheat, but the marketing system is
private enterprise. Here it is Govern-
ment controlled. But whether Socialist
or private enterprise, or a mixture of
both, price-cutting does not become
something else because you use the
euphemism hard bargaining. When
price cutting or hard bargaining, or
whatever you like to call it, is made pos-
sible by a consumer subsidy at home,
your image, in international conferences,
becomes tarnished.
Then there is the moral issue of aid.
Reverting again to the IFAP Executive
Committee report, the message seems
to be that other countries besides the
U.S. (which strongly influences IFAP)
are expected to replace the tack-
hammer with a sledge. On aid the IFAP
Executive Committee report said:
“Although they still fall far short of the
minimum foreseeable short-term re-
quirements of undernourished coun-
tries, IFAP welcomes the steps taken
in GATT to make a beginning with
multilateral sharing of the burdens of
food aid programs a real break-
through for a principle long advocated
by IFAP. The committee in this respect
also wishes to draw the attention of
governments and public opinion to the
necessity amply demonstrated by
the experience gained in the food-aid
field over 15 years and formally recog-
nised in all international procedures
that evolved during that period of
supplementing food aid in kind by addi-
tional aid in the form of services or
money to cover transportation and dis-
tribution costs.”
The report also referred to farm costs
in a way which will upset our estab-

On how to beat
the tax man
IMPORTANT CHANGES in the
“rules and regs” regarding income tax
for primary producers were introduced
in the 1966-67 Federal Budget. These
represent a further growth in the exist-
ing jungle of special provisions de-
signed to promote primary production.
By understanding them and availing
himself of the opportunities presented,
a farmer can probably go further faster
than by cleverly applying all the mar-
vels of science and technology that have
been recounted in this column.
Do you know, for instance, all the
wonderful ways in which the special
depreciation rate of 20 percent can be
worked indeed must be worked?
Where applicable this rate is obligat-
ory and a farmer is not allowed to
deduct depreciation at ordinary rates
even though they may be lower. And
do you appreciate that by coupling the
investment allowance with the special
depreciation allowance you will have,
after five years, deducted 120 percent of
the prime cost of the plant! This pro-
vision applies to certain new plant
only. A number of fairly minor items,
including hand tools, containers such as
milk-cans, office equipment, and, unfor-
tunately, road vehicles and structural
improvements are specifically excluded.
But it’s plain sailing for pretty well
every other piece of hardware that a
farm may have acquired prior to July
1, 1967. Incidentally, depreciation is cal-
culated on both the initial cost of the
item plus any expenses associated with
its installation. Thus the cost of dis-
mantling and removing old plant to
make way for the new would be in-
cluded.
Leads to all such savings can be
gleaned from a commendable little book
entitled “Income Tax For Farmers and
Graziers,” published under no less an
authority than the Rt. Hon. William
McMahon, MP, Commonwealth Trea-
surer, and available from your nearest
income tax office or the Department
of Primary Industry, Barton, Canberra.
The latest (seventh) edition is dated
February, 1967, and incorporates the
changes introduced in the last Budget.
Every farmer should spend a few hours
poring over its pages. Not that it will
make him a master of taxation law
in that time, but it will at least wise
him up sufficiently so that when he goes
shopping for a tax consultant he will
be able to recognise a good one when
he finds him.
The booklet, of some 70 pages, is
written in relatively simple language
a most sensible and meritorious
accomplishment, especially in view of
the fact that the words usually emanat-
ing from the Tax Office are joined in
sequences that would baffle the wisdom
of a Solomon. Even so, an index of defi-
nitions could have been a help. (What
is “notional” income?) Moreover, the
book covers the personal and family
aspects of taxation as well. Neverthe-
less, it should not be regarded as a
completely adequate guide. For ex-
ample, it would lead one to assume that
a dependant who has an income exceed-
ing a certain maximum is a write-off
for deduction purposes. But this is not
necessarily so. You can still claim for
the portion of the year during which
the dependant was fully dependent on
you. The situation typically arises in the
case of a student-dependant who takes
a good paying job during the long
summer holidays. By the way, if you
are a regular reader of this column you
could claim your subscription to The
Bulletin as a deduction. And don’t for-
get that the money levied from your
sales of wool, wheat, meat, etc., for
financing scientific research would also
be an allowable deduction.
Clearly, a farmer needs to keep very
detailed and orderly accounts for mak-
ing out his tax claim properly. They
are also essential for sophisticated farm
management. In the U.K., farmers get
a government grant of up to £lOO
sterling for three years to hire a profes-
sional accountant. The idea is that in
this time he will get everything
straightened out and simplified so that
the farmer can carry on by himself.
Farmers’ organisations here should cam-
paign for a similar arrangement.
Now a brief note about sources of
credit. Two compact, but comprehen-
sive, guides have appeared lately. Vic-
torian farmers desiring or needing to
raise a loan can consult “Farm Credit:
Sources and Terms,” a leaflet compiled
by the Agricultural Economics Branch
of the Department of Agriculture,
Treasury Place, Melbourne. Hylda A.
Rolfe, an economist, has done a simi-
lar job on behalf of the United Farmers
and Woolgrowers’ Association of N.S.W.
Send 25 cents to the secretary at 10
Castlereagh Street, Sydney, for a copy.
Like the Victorian leaflet, it tells you
all you need to know to get started
where to write, interest rates, security
required, repayment terms, and for
what purpose the loan funds are avail-
able. The Australian Bankers’ Associa-
tion recently pointed out that the pri-
vate banks are big, happy lenders to
farmers, and criticised the Victorian
leaflet for taking only four lines to
mention that a farmer should first
approach his local bank manager. Per-
haps the officer in the Victorian de-
partment responsible for this slight
should be hunted down and horse-
whipped, but most harassed seekers of
finance will surely bless this anonymous
soul for his quick signposted trip around
the moneylenders.


BOOKS
The Americans’ flight to nowhere
By ADAM RICHMOND
Waiting for the End the American
literary scene from Hemingway to
Baldwin. Leslie A. Fiedler. Penguin.
$1.30.
BORN THEORETICALLY WHITE,
Americans aL- permitted to pass their
childhood as imaginary Indians, their
adolescence as imaginary Negroes, and
only then are ' Ley expected to sr,ttle
down to being what they are told they
really are: white once more. If they
can’t stand being White Anglo-Saxon
Protestants in the way in which these
are now' mythicised by the Negroes
they can, in early middle-age, now be-
come imaginary Jews, modelling them-
selves, in accordance with their politics
and taste, on Herman Wouk or Leon
Uris, Irwin Shaw, Saul Bellow, or
Bernard Malamud.
According to Leslie Fiedler it is
this desire to escape into innocence
and freedom that is characteristic of
American life. The gestures of Ameri-
can intellectual despair at the neces-
sary failure of this quest are chron-
icled so effectively in “Waiting for the
End” that now that it is out in paper-
back it is worth another notice; not
least because what the birthplace of
tobacco, potatoes, and Coke originates,
the rest of the world may follow'.
When Americans encouraged their chil-
dren to play the games of the frontier,
as cow'boys or Indians, the world aped
them, its heroes Gary Cooper or Sit-
ting Bull, stolid-faced, inarticulate.
“Wherever jeans go, and they go every-
where that Coca-Cola goes, the dream
Ernest .Hemingway... redskin
Gary Cooper ... cowboys and Indians
of the West goes with them.” Nov/ that
American youth are honorary Negroes,
in their speech and gait, in the clothes
they wear, in the music they love, and
in the drugs they take, some of the
world also follows.
To Fiedler, this longing for primitive
innocence is made up of the combin-
ation of a dream and a nightmare of
race relations that constitute the leg-
ends of the West (Indians) or of the
South (Negroes). An Eden was lost
as America moved from trapper to
settler. “What makes the Golden Age
golden is, in the case of the Indian, an
imagined state of peace between white
man and red: love, innocence, a kind
of religious, even other-worldly calm,
preside over this peace. And w hat makes
the Iron Age is a state of w'ar between
redskin natives and paleface invaders:
a burden of hatred and guilt, revenges
and counter-revenges, make this war
ultimate hell.”
In 19th-century American writing
there was a myth of the races coming-
together in homosexual companionship.
Then, after a period in which men
like Hemingway transmuted themseJves
into Indians, even writing like redskins,
there is now the dream of each race
becoming the other. The hipsters be-
come their idea of Negroes; the new
generation of Negroes can now become
the hipsters’ idea of Negroes. Unfortu-
nately for clarity the hipster seems to
be becoming as much Indian as Negro,
“a frontiersman in the Wild West of
American life.” Somehow it was neces-
sary, says Fiedler, for white Americans
to be reborn as imaginary Indians be-
fore they could become imaginary
Negroes. Even as long ago as the
Boston Tea Party, to demonstrate that
they were no longer Europeans, the
New England palefaces put on feathers
and warpaint.
For a while, in the ’forties and
’fifties, with the migration of writers
to the universities, there was an
attempt to break free from the con-
tempt for the Professor and from the
cult of raw experience. But now, says
Fiedler, the, youth of the ’sixties re-
turn to the revolts of the ’twenties,
running away from college to strange
lands in search of salvation, and again
seeking, in writing, the callow and
immature, and the chumminess
engendered by the ghetto life of
bohemian refugees.
They long for World War 111, as
all generations long for the Gotter-
dammerung they most fear. They long
to reject the Great Prosperity, but
they know that to “choose poverty”
would merely cost their parents a sum
equal to a fairly comfortable living
in the Great Depression. They have
nowhere to flee. To them America is
a vulgar, grey, standardised sub-
culture, one part of it just like another,
and if they flee to Europe there is no
longer a place where the busloads of
middlebrows do not soon settle down;
besides, Europe is now remaking it-
self in the image of America as fast
as it can.
To escape America because it has
become a travesty of its own dream
... to seek some other place as an
imagined Utopia ... to hunger for
absolute freedom, to seek what can
never be found ... in their plight
they are still very American, with only
their method of flight different. With
James Baldwin... protest literature


no place now in the world to go, they
attempt to escape to that other globe,
to their own heads, “to the unexplored
reaches of their sub-minds.” Reject-
ing the old cults of sexual freedom
and of alcohol, they enter this world
with the help of dope, or with strobo-
scopic lights, or the exercises of various
mystical sects, and thereby, as Fiedler
says, returning to the discipline tradi-
tionally called magic. Their reading
becomes the monumental stupidity of
protest literature, a satisfying return
to the tradition of anti-intellectualism.
And their flight toward absolute free-
dom ends, as such flights always must,
in the practices and mystiques of a
kind of supernaturalism.
Terrorists, Australia
The frame-up
By DONALD YOUNG
Sydney’s Burning. lan Turner. Heine-
mann. $6.75.
“IF THE POLITICIANS of Australia
want war, let them take their own car-
cases to the firing line ... If they want
blood, LET THEM CUT THEIR
OWN THROATS.” Almost alone
among Australian organisations at the
beginning of World War T, the small
group of Anarcho-Syndicalists who had
formed into the Industrial Workers of
the World (the “Wobblies”) expressed
immediate opposition.
The Australian Wobblies had taken
their lines in 1911 from the Chicago
Wobblies, the “Bummery” as they were
known because of their fondness for
the famous hobo song “Hallelujah, I’m
A Bum.” They despised political action
as a fraud, believing that “direct action”
by worker against boss, in strike and
sabotage, would lead to the apocalyptic
general strike. When the day of the
general strike dawned, governments
would topple and, with production
organised in syndicates of trade unions,
man would be free.
It now sounds as improbable as any
other millenarian creed, but during
World War I it seemed likely enough
to provide the main element of fringe
radicalism in Australia. lan Turner
writes about the destruction of the Aus-
tralian Wobblies, an act that centred
on the jailing of 12 of them for arson,
with others being jailed for other
reasons.
He does not attempt to reconstruct
the feel of anarcho-syndicalism and the
kind of motives that led men to it,
but he puts up a convincing case when
he suggests that, while some of the
Wobblies were arsonists or would-be
arsonists, the 12 men went to jail as a
result of a frame-up organised by some
elements of the police conniving with
one member of the N.S.W. Government
and that this served the interests of the
conscription referendum campaign. As
with other frame-ups, innocent parties
came to the defence of the framers and
the result was probably the greatest
scandal in Sydney this century, corrupt-
ing those who were connected with it.
Terrorists, Russia
The dust-heap
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Russian Terrorists. Ronald Seth.
Barrie and Rockliff. $5.30.
TO ANYONE REARED in the stolid
political pragmatism of the Anglo-Saxon
world the Russian 19th-century Nihilists
appear like characters in some grotesque
Grand Guignol nightmare. The Nihilist
theory was that if you blew up enough
Tsars, Grand Dukes, military governors,
and police chiefs the dumb giant of the
Russian people would rise out of the
soil, shake off its chains, and establish
a simple Slav Utopia that would both
astound and set an example to the
whole corrupt Western world.
Nihilism, of course, shares in the
meretricious glamor that surrounds all
hopeless causes. The terrorists did suc-
ceed (after many crude, blundering
failures) in killing Tsar Alexander II
and a handful of other magnates; for
about 40 years their sporadic acts of
terror made life uncertain for the more
brutal Tsarist ministers and provincial
governors. But never at any time
was there the slightest sign that the
mass of the Russian people would
accept these lunatic conspirators as
their liberators. The Nihilists remained
an isolated band of fanatics, living in
a dream world from which they were
finally and rudely awakened by the
tramp of Marxist revolution. “You are
miserable individuals,” Trotsky scorn-
fully told the last survivors. “You
have played out your role. Go where
Australia’s Wobblies hold a picnic in 1917, when The Twelve were jailed
you belong —to the dustheap of
history.”
The most astonishing of the Nihilist
plotters were the women. Most of
them were delicately nurtured blue-
stockings who, in England, would have
been suffragettes or earnest tillers in
the fields of literature and social ser-
vice. In Russia they filled bombs,
smuggled bags of dynamite under
their petticoats, and sheltered fugitives
on the run from the terrible Third
Section of the Tsarist police. Some
were active assassins, like Sofia Perov-
skaya, who was hanged after the
murder of Alexander 11. Others like
Vera Figner, Maria Spiridonova, and
Vera Zasulich spent years in prison
or exile.
In the deadly cat-and-mouse game
between conspirators and authorities
each side contrived to infiltrate the
other’s ranks, and Ronald Seth has
unearthed a surprising amount of in-
formation about the mysterious Eugene
Azeff, who for years doubled the roles
of a leading Nihilist and a secret
Tsarist agent. The “Judas of the
terror” is worth a book to himself,
though I’m afraid Seth is not the man
to tell it.
Wit and strength
By KATHERINE RANDERSON
Lolly Willows and Mr. Fortune’s Mag-
got. Sylvia Townsend Warner. Chatto
and Windus. $3.85.
The Heat of the Sun. Sean O’Faolain.
Hart Davis. $3.85.
SYLVIA TOWNSEND WARNER,
along with her fellow-countryman,
V. S. Pritchett, seems to be the only
writer long to withstand the marsh-
mallow pressures of “The New Yorker”
magazine. While the Updikes and


Cheevers in that arid atmosphere grow
flaccid and wordy, Miss Warner, now,
according to “Who’s Who,” well into
her seventies, continues with pleasing
frequency to insinuate into that maga-
zine stories which are full-bodied, ele-
gant, and clever.
Her publishers have now re-issued,
rather handsomely, two of her novellas
from the ’twenties. “Lolly Willowes” is
the story of an unmarried woman in
England at the turn of this century.
Nothing of Miss Warner’s could carry
anything as deadening as a message,
but “Lolly Willowes” does make clear
that if women’s lives have to be made
boring and limited in the cause of up-
holding middle-class standards and
customs, then they will turn to any-
thing, even the Devil, for relief.
“Mr. Fortune’s Maggot” begins:
“Though the Reverend Timothy For-
tune had spent three years in the
island of Fanua he had made but one
convert. Some missionaries might have
been galled by this state of things, or if
too good to be galled, at least flustered,
but Mr. Fortune was a humble man at
heart and he had the blessing which
rests upon humility: an easy-going
nature.” This seems quite enough to
show that Miss Warner, from the be-
ginning, had a wit and strength which
could not easily be deflected.
O’Faolain’s “The Heat of the Sun”
is an entirely pleasing collection of
what the author, with some care, divides
into short stories and tales. A short
story, he says, “is like a child’s kite,
a small wonder, a brief, bright
moment,” but a tale is like a small
plane, “it is much more free, carries
a bit more cargo, roves farther.”
O’Faolain explores many aspects of
his fellow-countrymen’s behaviour, both
in their own country and in other
people’s. Because he is characteristi-
cally good tempered and tolerant about
some things which agitate the Irish
a good deal, it does not mean that he
is less aware. Comparisons with, say,
Frank O’Connor, are unfair and use-
less. They have nothing in common
except that both are Irish writers and
have lived in a country which seems
to provide endless material for short-
story writers. “The Bosom of the
Country” is a splendid tale.
With scythes

Fifty Works of English Literature We
Could Do Without. Brigid Brophy,
Michael Levey, Charles Osborne.
Rapp and Carroll Limited. $4.25.
SALLYING INTO THE GARDEN of
English literature with iconoclastic zeal,
the authors find it choked with weeds.
The fertiliser for this noxious luxuri-
ance, they argue, is the implied obliga-
tion, instilled in us from schooldays, to
like dull books, and with rare skill they
Brigid Bruphy ... incinerator
wield a well-honed scythe among under-
growth they believe hides basic flaws
in some of the most revered writing in
the English language.
And when they have finished the
task, you have to agree it was well
worth while, for even when the authors’
charges are not especially well sub-
stantiated, their acuity is clear. One or
more sequels could be written about
the lush undergrowth in more recent
literature.
The 50 works which the three critics
consign to the incinerator are mostly
by writers no longer living. They span
the centuries, from antiquities such as
“The York Mystery Plays” (“the
cynically concocted doggerel of a com-
mittee of drunken monks at St. Mary’s
Chapel, York, in 1350”) through the
hallowed volumes of “Hamlet,” “Pil-
grim’s Progress,” “The School for
Scandal,” “The Essays of Elia,” “Jane
Eyre,” “The Hound of Heaven,” “The
Forsyte Saga,” and others, to the
failures of moderns such as Sitwell,
Huxley, Maugham, and Hemingway.
In justification of their literary may-
hem, the trio caution that when dross
and works of genius carry the same
label, “classic,” there is a danger of
forcing children into philistinism, even
when philistinism is against their natural
bent. They take strong sideswipes at
“Lorna Doone,” “Huckleberry Finn,”
“Tom Jones,” “Moby Dick,” “Tess
of the D’Urbervilles,” “Peter Pan,” and
even wide-eyed Alice. We are reminded
that “the Reverend Charles Lutwidge
Dodgson, alias Lewis Carroll, was, as
we all know, a very ordinary Victorian
clergyman. That is, he was kinky about
little girls, and he was an extremely
dull, humorless man . . . the imagina-
tion that contrived the adventures of
Alice is a tired imagination.”
Another unassailable, “The Faerie
Queene,” gets a severe drubbing . . .
“It must be admitted that few poems
lend themselves better to the examina-
tion system. It is impossible not to
catch out candidates on either the
language or the story both of which
are preposterous to the point of in-
comprehensibility.” And then there’s
the Elegy “which belongs to Gray as
inevitably as the Wells to Sadler,” and
to which, it is remarked, the poet
brought a poverty of thought entirely
his own, though his vocabulary was
borrowed from greater men.
Even Mr. Pickwick is characterised
as a man of bogus jollity and innate
snobbishness, which appears to have
endeared him to the Victorian middle
classes, a quite loathsome fellow through
whom Dickens recommended that the
way to live is dim-wittedly and self-
indulgently, and that if we muddle
through in this essentially selfish
manner all will come right in the end.
Jewish ghosts

In My Father’s Court. Isaac Bashevis
Singer. Seeker & Warburg. $3.85.
Short Friday. Isaac Bashevis Singer.
Seeker & Warburg. $3.85.
THESE POLISH JEWISH stories are
all haunted in one way or another by
ghosts from the last days of a doomed
world that was finally to submerge in
the blood-deluges of organised geno-
cide.
Spirits walk quite literally in the
occult and supernatural legends of
“Short Friday,” a collection of spine-
chillers teeming with the Semitic forms
of witches, werewolves, black-magicians,
phantom-doubles, and other assorted
devils. In contrast, the ghosts in the
autobiographical episodes that make
up “In My Father’s Court” are pure,
white, and innocent, reminiscences of
a happy poverty-stricken childhood
spent in a pious, “puritan,” orthodox
household in the old Warsaw ghetto.
Isaac Bashevis Singer has lived in
America since 1935 and is generally
labelled as among the best Jewish
authors. This is a backhanded sort of
distinction because the field is so small.
His only rival would probably be the
Israeli Samuel Joseph Agnon, who won
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966.
In these two collections there are
no redundant characters hanging about
and the world of a remembered past
and a mythical “never-was” do not
impinge on each other, but are ex-
plored separately. The tales come spin-
ning out effortlessly in a single fine
thread of narrative. In a few' words
Singer creates the atmosphere and
builds up tension till it breaks exactly
where he wants it.
In both volumes one feels the
heritage of an ancient culture, with
its roots still firmly planted in the Old
Testament . . . indeed, among the
most endearing features are the res-
pectfully intimate terms on which

everyone seems to live with biblical
figures.
The original Yiddish title of “In
My Father’s Court” was “Beth Din,”
which is an age-old rabbinical institu-
tion founded by Moses himself, a com-
bined court of law, house of religious
study, and pyschoanalyst’s consulting-
room. As a child in Warsaw, Singer was
allowed to listen to his father presiding
at countless “Beth Din” hearings.
Singer shows how the combined
duties of holy man, lawyer, judge,
doctor, exorciser, and general factotum
fell to this saintly, unworldly Rabbi,
as renowned in the neighborhood for
his integrity as for the impecunious
state that usually goes with it.
The occult fables of “Short Friday,”
on the other hand, show just how
little difference there is, basically, in
Semite devils and their disciples and
familiars and any other race’s and
creed’s. The stories cover the whole
territory: heaven, hell, purgatory, and
that place where you get a taste of
each earth.
Preposterous
By JOHN BAXTER
Dietrich. Leslie Frewin. Leslie Frewin.
$3.85.
FREWIN’S BOOK ON Marlene Diet-
rich has had an eventful history.
Originally published under the title
“Blond Venus” in 1955, it quickly
established itself as one of the least
accurate estimates of an artist’s career
and character ever written, a not in-
considerable feat in the field of modern
writing about films. It is alleged that
Miss Dietrich was on the point of
suing Mr. Frewin when she discovered
he was poor, and the case was drop-
ped. One wonders whether she will re-
consider the matter now that the
author has money and is able to pub-
lish the book in a slightly updated
version under his own imprint.
As a work of reference and infor-
mation, “Dietrich” is beyond criticism.
The brief index of her films alone con-
tains 14 errors, while the text is rife
with them. Of Mr. Frewin’s critical
judgments, it can only be said that
even when he has seen the films about
which he speaks, and that would
appear to be seldom, his understanding
of them is sketchy in the extreme.
Even where he has quoted an authority
on some aspect of the exhilarating Miss
Dietrich’s career, the information he
retails is so preposterous that one is
bound to doubt even those things which
sound plausible. It is interesting to note
that Josef von Sternberg, confronted
by the statements in this book
attributed to him, categorically denied
them all.
Probably more distressing than the
violence done to fact by Mr. Frewin
is that committed on Miss Dietrich’s
image. The picture that emerges from
this book is that of a person unbear-
ably gauche, patronising, and arrogant.
Frewin recounts, seemingly with
approval, such titbits of information
as Dietrich’s grisly habit of half-smok-
ing a cigarette and handing it to her
dresser to finish, and a selection of her
remarkable dinner appearances, in-
cluding one where she spent the meal
discussing with Sir Alexander Fleming
the use of penicillin in the treatment
of venereal disease. He finds sad but
understandable her dropping of long-
time friend Erich Maria Remarque be-
cause he did not look after some gold-
fish she had presented to him, and
“elegant” her failure to appear at a
party to launch von Sternberg’s
memoirs. On the strength of these dis-
closures, Miss Dietrich must be well
at the bottom of everybody’s dinner
list.
While the book may offer us some
of the funniest examples of irrelevant
detail in any similar work (“She even
drew praise from the formidable
General Patton, whose unpublished
diaries are said to contain several
approving references to her”), it is
also among the worst written and most
tedious chronicles ever committed to
paper. In his introduction, Frewin out-
lines a plot which he alleges was
Marlene Dietrich ... exhilarator
hatched by sinister forces to prevent
its publication. He suggests this was
the work of his enemies, but one
wonders whether it was not actually
organised by friends.


LETTERS
The tobacco industry
In the past few weeks I have read
editorials and articles in national and
local daily newspapers relating to the
Australian tobacco industry and whether
or not it should be sacrificed for the
sake of the wool industry, the latest
of which appeared in The Bulletin,
July 8.
For the uninitiated, 10 million lb. of
the 26 million lb. of tobacco grown in
Australia is produced by a few farmers
in Victoria, 10 million lb. by farmers
in the Dimbulah-Mareeba area in North
Queensland, and the rest by farmers in
areas stretching from Bundaberg in
Queensland to the New England table-
land in N.S.W. We all operate under
the same price and grade schedule and
receive much the same price for our
commodity. In actual fact, for reasons
other than quality, some areas have re-
ceived a premium over and above the
North Queensland farmer, but despite
this he is still in business and can
compete with his fellow southern farmer
in costs, something which our other
friend, Dr. Davidson, might look at
more closely some time when he stops
for breath.
In your latest little jewel, you state
“The Government decided only three
years ago to give this industry a very-
special form of protection so that it
could expand.” Even Messrs. McEwen
and Adermann, the only friends the
tobacco industry seems to have in Can-
berra, would boggle at that one.
For the sake of security in the
industry (a guaranteed minimum price
for a given grade) the farmer agreed
to a cut in production for four years,
which in North Queensland represented
a cut of 40 percent on the average of
the best two years’ over the previous
four years’ production for any quota
over 10,0001 b. Most quotas are above
20,0001 b. Th ; s has left the farmer, of
course, to cope with a continuing over-
head on lower profits.
You say “tobacco has a certain sacred
quality.” We are not parasites on the
community, we pride ourselves on being-
producers and we claim we are efficient
within our industry.
As a final fling you say, “Do we
seriously believe that farmers growing
tobacco cannot be expected to switch
to something else?” Some of the unfor-
tunate tobacco-growers from the Bur-
dekin area in Queensland would find
grim humor in that remark. Lumping-
overdrafts a kangaroo couldn’t jump
over, they landed smack in the middle
of a depressed sugar market when they
switched from tobacco to sugar after
being forced out of the industry by
higher quality standards.
As in everything else, a farmer these
days must be a specialist to survive and
he’s taking a gamble when he enters
a new field of primary production.
Finally, although I’ve no doubt the
wool industry has been doing its share
of lobbying, to its credit it hasn’t pub-
licly, to my knowledge, come out —as
you have —advocating the sacrifice of
one primary industry for the sake of
another.

Higham's Sydney
Bravo for Charles Lligham! His article
on “Sydney ’67” was balanced, stimu-
lating, and poetic, imbued with
an almost covert affection for this
vibrant, variable town. Above all, it
was not once guilty of those archaic
and irrelevant comparisons with Mel-
bourne.
I must, however, take issue with him
in regard to my own suburb of
Lugarno, to which he refers, along with
surrounding areas, as “representing
the best of Sydney life.” This view,
although flattering, is a little too rose-
colored to go unchallenged.
Lugarno may indeed boast quietude
and beauty, but the facts are that for
the most part the suburb is unsewered,
and that we lack facilities such as
playing fields, pavements, and pre-
school kindergai'tens. All romantically
rural, I suppose, but hardly the best
that life in Sydney offers.
Perhaps, after all, life in faded, jaded
Bondi has compensations about which
Mr. Higham and we, in these “idyllic”
suburbs, know nothing.
Val Rietmann
Lugarno, N.S.W.
Charles Higham has written a very
unrealistic portrayal of sport in Eng-
land in his article “Sydney, ’67” (8.,
June 24).
Perhaps he has not experienced Ascot
or Epsom, Wimbledon, Twickenham,
Wembly, or Henley, or watched country
village cricket on late summer evenings,
or yachting on the Norfolk Broads and
Solent, to mention only a few of the
many varied English sporting scenes,
some of which could be classed as “a
torture.” I have even known Aus-
tralians who enjoyed surfing on Cornish
and Devonshire beaches for a number
of seasons.
It is this kind of reporting which
gives an incorrect image of certain
aspects of English life to Australian
readers who have not had the oppor-
tunity of travelling overseas, and which,
surely, cannot serve any useful pur-
pose.
When referring to sport in Sydney,
one could describe an afternoon spent
on the “hill” at a particularly hard-
fought game of football, which, while
being one of Sydney’s most famous and
favorite sporting pastimes, is hardly an
“aesthetic experience,” or perhaps an
evening at the roller game, or any
other similar “beautiful” Australian
sports; and thus, in the same way, give
an equally bad impression of sport in
this country to the misinformed over-
seas reader.

Hard "bits" to swallow
From Donald Horne.’s article, “The
British Pull-Out” (8., July 1): “While
maintaining some bits of a Navy and
Air Force . . . we should concentrate
in particular on the Army so that it
can play an expeditionary and/or
training role where needed . . .”
Some bits? How expeditionary is an
Army without adequate sea and air
support? Remember, we are to work
out a policy for our armed forces that
takes into account their distinctive—and
peculiarly Australian—problems. Surely
we will need more than bits of a Navy
and an Air Force.

India's cows
Your treatment of the Indian cow-
slaughter question in Agrisearch (8.,
May 29) missed the main point. The
campaign is directed against useless
cattle, mainly the aged beasts unable
to bear further calves or continue work-
ing, and the scavengers, which are a
great nuisance in many of the cities. I
have seen shopkeepers in large cities
fighting hungry cattle to prevent them
from knocking down their merchandise.
Mr. Harris’ point is quite valid, that
better-fed cattle would breed more often
and milk better. But it is precisely be-
cause the useless ones are not destroyed
that the younger ones are poorly fed.
Some control must be introduced to
break the vicious cycle.
No one who has first-hand experi-
ence of the situation doubts for a
moment the vital role of the cow in the
Indian economy. It is the practices
which make the cattle population so
inefficient in its main functions of
supplying fuel, power, and milk which
the slaughter campaign was designed to
curb. It should be added that the main
anti-slaughter agitation comes from
political extremists aiming to capitalise
on the situation and not from the
“humble Hindu.”

Psychedelic defenders
In Psyche’delic (8., July 8), if the break
is made after the “e” then we have
PSYCHE, meaning the spirit or soul,
and DELIC, which could be the first
two syllables of either the verb “deli-
cate,’' meaning, according to the Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary, “to take
one’s pleasure, revel, or luxuriate”; or
from the adjective and substantive
“delicate,” from whose several mean-
ings “characterised by sensuous delight,”
“finely sensitive,” “a thing that gives
pleasure” can be chosen as pertinent.
The actual choice can depend on
the personal definition one gives to
experiences called psychedelic—either
an uplifting or a squandering of the
spirit.

EDELIC and claiming that EDELIC
has no known ancestry in Latin or
Greek. Before breaking up like that,
One More Week should have stretched
its mind to include one more letter.
Maybe OMW learned to spell with
blocks, but in the ABC of LSD the way
the sugar-cubes tumble is PSYCHE-
DELIC.
Psyche-delicate? Psyche - delicious?
Psyche-de-licit? Psyche-de-licentious?
Psyche-delinquent? Or should it really
be psyche-delphic in honor of those
ladies who would come tripping
through the temple fumes to tell what
it was they saw?
No. Judging from the shift of images
and colors, and the tidal letters of the
posters, one would settle most for
PSYCHE-DELIQUESCING. Yet if it
is true that tongues lick while psyches
liquefy, one would deny the LSD-
user’s contempt for us COOH-users
there surely is more expansion to be
got from a bottle of steam.

we are
to match the growth in commerce
The growth of our cities is obvious to anybody who walks along the
streets. Each new structure symbolizes the continuing expansion of
Australia, and behind each building, old or new, Olympic cables will
be at work in telephone lines, in the lighting and air-conditioning
systems, in fact as the electrical sinews of the modern office.
In the past few years, Olympic Cables have more than doubled their
capacity to service the needs of commerce.
Olympic Cables is a member of the all-Australian Olympic Group
of Companies.
Olympic cables help you live better electrically

One of Hennessy’s many Paradis where their old cognac is kept.
All
Hennessy
cognac
is bottled
from
time-
honoured
blends
A little of this. A measure of that.
Hennessy cognac is a master-
blend of old brandies . . . drawn
from the largest and finest reserves
in the world. That’s why the subtle
excellence of Hennessy cognac
never varies.
And that goes back to when
Hennessy started distilling brandy
in the district of Cognac before
Napoleon was born.
Hennessy Cognac is distilled and
blended in Cognac. No Co<™ac
could be more French.
HENNESSY
BRAS ARME
COGNAC
Established in Cognac
since 1765.
