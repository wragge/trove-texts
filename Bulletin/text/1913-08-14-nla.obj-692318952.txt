Paints
For the Engineer, Electrician, Builder, Mining Man.
Paint is only a protective coating;. If it is the right kind it is acid and alkali proof, and will
not dry out, nor dust off; neither will it peel off nor flake off. It just stays where it is put, till
in the course of nature it wears out like everything else—then a second coat is needed.
We make P & B Paints of this nature for the use of men whose business it is to protect
machinery and buildings, smoke stacks and floors, bridges and such like. If you are one of
these men we should like to send you our booklets. May we?

Strindberg
At last a biography of Strindberg.
August Strindberg: the Spirit of Revolt,
Studies and Impressions, by L. Lind-af-
Hageby (Paul) isn’t much of a biography;
but with respect to a genius so extraordinary
and so multifarious any biography is wel-
come. Thus, if Cain, for instance, had left
a full confession, or Moses had kept a diary,
both works, however lacking in stvle the
hieroglyphics were, would be worth reading.
For even in literature we can’t get on with-
out facts and dates: that is what makes a
railway time-table the finest piece of litera-
ture in the world when you want to catch
that last train home—or don’t want to
catch it home. So Miss Lind-af-Hageby
supplies the necessary dates and facts,
though surely a woman is the last sort of
animal that should be allowed to interpret
this supreme hater of womanhood. Well,
for our facts, and the opinions of L. Lind-
af-Hageby.
d*
Strindberg died on May 14, 1912. His
collected works, shortly to be published in
a new edition —-or, possibly, a new library—
consist of 115 plays, novels, collections of
stories, essays and poems. The diary in
which, during the last 14 years, he re-
corded his visions and supernatural experi-
ences, will not be published for many years
to come. His dying words were: “Every-
thing personal is now obliterated. I have
settled with life. My account has been
rendered. This (picking up a Bible) alone
is right.”
From his four autobiographical novels,
The Bondswoman’s Bon (recently reviewed
here as The Son of a Servant), Fermenta-
tion Time, In the Red Room and The
Author, all written at the age of 39, we
get a groundwork of facts. Born in 1849.
His school life we have already summarised.
In 1867 he went to Upsala University, his
sole capital being under £5. He returned
after one term to Stockholm, and got a job
as teacher at a board-school at £5O a year.
At the age of 19 he possessed all the usual
vices of virile youth. Next he became a
medical student, failed to pass his examina-
tion, decided to become an actor, was em-
ployed as a super, failed in an ambitious
part, meant to commit suicide, but was
persuaded by a friend that getting drunk
would be easier. Four days after he wrote his
first play. It was rejected. He returned
to Upsala. His one-act play, In Rome, was
performed at Stockholm when Strindberg
was 21 years old. Another attempt at sui-
cide was frustrated by his friends with the
kindly aid of alcohol. He could not be
happy at home, and lived on one of the
Baltic islands in a fisherman’s cottage. In
bitter poverty he got his Viking play
accepted, and the King gave the dramatist
a yearly pension. Next he was dismissed
from the university as being insolent and
crazy. He took up painting, came to the
conclusion that he was going mad, and
offered to go to an asylum for cure. The
King stopped his pension, and Strindberg
went to Stockholm as an art-critic, even
contributor to a women’s illustrated paper,
and dramatist. But his paper died, Strind-
berg turned to drama; his first great play.
Master Olof, was written in an interval of
asceticism, and, of course, rejected. Next
he became editor of a paper devoted to in-
surance, evidently a sort of Swedish Wild
Oat Column. The paper failed. He fell
seriously ill, and on recovery fell violently
in love with his housekeeper. After an in-
terval he became a telegraph operator, and
then once more a journalist. But he and
his paper could not agree, and he left, to
return to poverty. Then the post of
assistant librarian in the Royal Library of
Stockholm came his way. In 1869 his novel,
The Red Room, was published, and made
the author’s name; and thenceforward
Strindberg, having found himself and found
his audience, went on feverishly writing.
The record of his life now becomes merely
the dating and examination of his many
plays and stories.
d*
Of Strindberg his biographer says:—
“There was something cometic in the swift-
ness and intensity with which he appeared,
disturbing the well-ordered orbits of tradi-
tions and conventions... .No sooner had
people congratulated themselves that his ter-
rible lust for destruction had passed by their
favorite systems and their cherished ideals,
than his ruthless force was upon them, ex-
posing ugliness and scattering treasures....
He wrote books which were decidedly and
unblushingly immoral. He compelled atten-
tion by blasphemous outbursts He dis-
sected the human heart, laid bare its mean-
ness, its uncleanliness ; made men and women
turn on each other with sudden understand-
ing, and loathing, and walked away smiling
at the evil he had wrought. He turned on
himself with savage hatred, and in book*
bearing the mark of the flagellant and reflect-
ing the agony of a soul in torment, he pointed
to his sins and his stripes. .. .He was—him-
self; and he worked ceaselessly at the task of
finding himself. Strindberg the atheist, the
scientist, the spiritualist, the mystic, the
sensualist, the ascetic, took equally import-
ant parts in his theatre of life. The critic
met him day by day in different attire and
pose, incarnations of the elusive self which
was stage-manager of this extraordinary per-
formance.
“There can be no doubt that it was difficult
to live with Strindberg. The Swedes had to
live with him, and the household of those who
set themselves up to guard the propriety and
integrity of literary art was day by day
threatened by his revolutionary ideas, his
personal attacks on spotless individuals, his
coarse-grained descriptions of indescribable
things.”
As a result of the many attacks made upon
Strindberg in Sweden, theatrical managers
fought shy of his plays. It took 14 years for
The Father, after its production in Paris, to
reach Stockholm. He suffers, too, seriously
from translation.
“His sentences are wrought with a nervous
force which is untranslatable. He is often
ungrammatical—each sentence is a living
whole which cannot be divided. . . .Translated
from German into English he is unrecognis-
able. The difficulty of fusing his meaning
and style in a new form is also apparent in
the direct translations into English which
have been made.... The belief is expressed
that Strindberg’s prose will be rendered bet-
ter in “American” than in English.... He
wrote because he had to, without any desire
to build up a style ; without any desire, in-
deed, but to get his thoughts down on
paper.”
J*
“My brain works incessantly,” he said.
“It grinds and grinds like a mill, and I can-
not make it stop. I get no peace before I
see my thoughts on paper, and then some-
thing new begins immediately, and there is
the same misery. I write and write, and do
not even read through what I have written
....When I have finished my work for the
day, I always note on a piece of paper what
I shall begin with the next day. The whole
long afternoon and , evening I collect
material for next day’s work. During my
morning walk my thoughts are further con-
densed, and when I return from my wander-
ings I am charged like an electric machine.
As soon as I have paper and pen ready it
bursts out. The words literally tumble
over me, and the pen works under high
pressure in order to get everything down on
paper. When I have written for a while I
have a feeling that I am floating in space.
Then it is as if a higher will than my own
made the pen glide over the paper, guide it
to write down words which seem to me en-
tirely inspired.”
Strindberg used absinthe, but he cannot
be put on the long list of literary drunks
who required alcohol before they could
write. Strindberg required alcohol to pre-
vent him writing. In one of his plays he
explained why he drank so much. “Because
I am always lying on the operating-table,
and have to chloroform myself.” The only
way to ease up the mental machinery was
to clog it up with alcohol.
So with his misogynism:—
“I have always worshipped women, these
enchanting, criminal minxes whose worst
crimes are not registered in criminal statis-
tics. But I have had sufficiently bad—or
good—taste to tell them the truth, and they
have revenged themselves by calling me a
woman-hater. Just think, if these priest-
esses of revenge knew how many successes
with the fair sex their revenge has brought
me! Inquisitiveness, the original sin of
Eve, drew the little ingenues to the monster,
and the monster put no obstacles in the way
for even the most inquisitive to satisfy their
curiosity Many thanks, my charming
enemies.”
That was the sort of man he was. How
maliciously he could hit back!
Jt
His last years in Stockholm passed in
calm. He lived a literary hermit, com-
panioned as always by poverty, and though
affluence was on its way toward him — a
publisher paid £ll,OOO for the Swedish
rights of all his published works—it came
too late. On January 22, 1912, the whole
Swedish nation celebrated his 63rd birth-
day, with presentations, torchlight proces-
sions, and the performance in all the
theatres of his plays. The apotheosis came
to a dying man.
Georgian Poetry
The Poetry Bookshop publishes under the
above title a collection of verses di'awn en-
tirely from the publications of the past two
years in England, and ventures modestly to
hope “that we are at the beginning of an-
other ‘Georgian period’ which may take rank
in du-e time with the several great poetic
ages of the past.” Why not? The majority
of these 17 selected modern English poets
have something individual to say, and much
that they say is poetry. Had the book been
by one pen it would have w’on unanimous
praise; but its homogeneity remains though
it is made of the siftings of 17 poets. The
Poetry Bookshop is hereby exhorted to make
an annual anthology of English verse with
the same discriminating taste; and, judging
by the fact that this present volume is already
in its fifth edition, the yearly venture would
pay.
Lascelles Abercrombie, a poet whose pro-
lixity has hitherto prevented the present
scribe from reading him, appears in a quite
interesting selection, “The Sale of Saint
Thomas.” Gordon Bottomley has a curious
poem on Babel, in which he most cunningly
represents the confusion of speech mac -ame
suddenly upon the builders of that ancient
sky-scraper:—
Little men hurrying, running here and there,
Within the dark and stifling walls dissent
From every sound, and shoulder empty hods:
u The god’s great altar should stand in the
crypt
Among our earth's foundations." “The god's
great altar
Must be the last far coping of our work.”
"It should inaugurate the broad main stair."
“Or end it." “It must stand toward the
East!" ....
Then a lean giant, "Is not a calyx needful?”
“Because round grapes on statues well ex-
pressed
Become the nadir of incenst, nodal lamps,
Yet apes have hands thad but and carved
red crystal."
“Birds molten, touchly talc veins bronze buds
crumble
Ablid üblai ghan isz rad eighar g1aur1."....
Words said too often seemed such ancient
sounds
That men joryot them or were lost in tnem;
The guttural glottis-chasms of language
reached,
A rhythm, a gasp, were curves of immortal
thought.
Rupert Brooke presents “Dust” and “The
Fish” :
In a cool, curving world he lies
And ripples with dark ecstasies....
Those silent waters weave for him
A fluctuant mutable world and dim. ...
and “Town and Country”—all fine poems,
stuffed with thought and lit with restrained
fire. G. K. Chesterton is not worthily re-
presented. But William H. Davies has a
varied selection from that exquisite thing,
beginning:—
When primroses are out in sprang,
And small blue violets come between;
When merry birds sing on boughs green,
And rills, as soon as born, must sing ....
to more weighty work. Walter de la Mare
tells of “Miss Loo” and other daintily-
painted tea-table trifles. Wilfrid Wilson
Gibson’s “The Hare” is a finely wrought
piece of dramatic narration, in which he
shows a striking kinship to John Masefield.
This form of stark realism, finding poetry
and drama in common, modern things, is
the most individual contribution made by
the English school to modern poetry. We
have nothing like this form out here. W.
Vv. Gibson begins thus:—
My hands were hot upon a hare,
Half-strangled, struggling in a snare —
My knuckles at her warm wind-pipe —
When suddenly, her eyes shot back,
Big, fearful, staggering and black;
And, ere I knew, my grip was slack;
And I was clutching empty air,
Half-mad, half-glad at my lost luck.
When I awoke beside the stack. . . .
John Masefield, in “Biography,” contrives
to be interesting, though one fancies that
he could be more interesting in prose. T.
Sturge Moore is another of these narrative
poets, writing “A Sicilian Idyll” in a man-
ner most modern. But James Stephens is
a truer poet. “The Lonely God” is a thing
finely imagined :
So Eden was deserted, and at eve
Into the quiet place God came to grieve....
This was, the thought in Eden as He trod —
It is a lonely thing to be a g0d....
The other poets are dull or devitalised;
but there is enough modern poetry here of a
kind that challenges the reader’s interest.
Fiction
Henry Sydnor Harrison, author of that
striking success, Queed, keeps in its suc-
cessor, Y.V.’s Eyes (Constable, copies from
Dymock’s Library and George Robertson)
his high level of attainment. The eyes be-
long to Dr. V. Vivian, who possesses a hesi-
tating manner, a limp, and a John the Bap-
tist soul. Chance brings him into contact
with a beautiful, rich, but quite conven-
tional American girl, the daughter of a
cigar maker, the conditions of whose fac-
tory are shocking, even in the United States.
The girl’s sole aim in life is to make a good
marriage, and, aided by her managing
mother, she succeeds in captivating a lordly
male millionaire. But through a series of
dramatic encounters with this Christ-like
slum doctor, with his fierce zeal for reform,
the girl learns that there are other aims in
life. Her conversion to V.V.’s ideals is
convincingly told, though at exorbitant
length, but the style is so winning, the tone
so genial, the humor so human, and the
author’s personality so lovable, that the
book almost rta hes greatness. Not quite,
however. T! 11 j oral is too neat, the plot
too theatrically ucve-tailed. At times Har-
rison drops to the level of the society
novel of Robert W. Chambers. V.V.’s death
is too obviously necessitated—for one could
not marry a modern Christ—and the pathos
of it is absurdly overstrained. Solid work,
nevertheless, having much of the quality of
Frank Norris. Valuable, too, in that it is
a direct attack upon that tiresome person,
the American heroine.
J*
Edna Ferber is a feminine O. Henry. Her
work has all the slickness of the American
master of the journalistic story, but she
views life from a captivating feminine angle.
Roast Beef, Medium (Stokes, per Dymock’s
Library), tells in brilliant, business slang
the adventures of Emma McChesney, who
travelled the Vroad” for T. A. Buck’s
Featherloom Petticoats, and with her profits
kept her big son at college. Emma McChes-
ney is a delightful person, and Edna Ferber
introduces us to her business methods under
such frivolous and frilly chapter headings as
“Pink Tights and Ginghams.” “Simply
Skirts” and “Knee-deep in Knickers.” List
to her philosophy of the male: “Men are the
cusscdest creatures. This chap occupied the
same room with you last night and you don’t
even know his name. Funny! If two
strange women had found themselves oc-
cupying the same room for a night they
wouldn’t have got to the kimono and back-
hair stage before they would not only have
known each other’s name, but they’d have
tried on each other’s hats, swapped corset-
cover patterns, found mutual friends living
in Dayton, Ohio, taught each other a new
Irish crochet stitch, showed their family
photographs, told how their married sister’s
little girl nearly died with swollen glands,
and divided off the mirror into two sections
to paste their newly-washed handkerchiefs
on. Don’t tell me men have a genius for
friendship.’’
J*
The Outlaw, by David Hennessey (Hod-
per and Stoughton, per Sydney Book Club),
the much-heralded second-prize winner
in that firm’s recent novel competition,
looks exactly like a second-prize winner
in a novel competition. It has no
subtlety, no literary style, no plot
construction; it lumbers along with
a dull narrative flow. But —it has for hero
a noble bushranger, and it is packed with in-
cident, realistically depicted. It is true that
the bushranger is something new in Austra-
lian bushranging: he is a Hebrew. But he
has all the other marks of the ideal bush-
ranging hero. He rides the finest horse in
Australia ; he is courteous and cultured; he
possesses a superb physique; and he had
every excuse for taking to the bush. And
David Hennessey has made good use of his
background: he contrives to give a trust-
worthy picture of the conditions that made
bushranging possible. And he ends with the
inevitable midnight wedding and the escape
of the hero and his wife. What more can
the average reader want? It is not a great
book, but it is a quite readable book, fully
up to the level of several of the bushranging
yarns published by the N.S.W. Bookstall
Co.
J*
D. H. Lawrence, author of those curious
inchoate novels, The White Peacock and I’he
Trespasser, has gained command of his
material in his latest work. Sons and Lovers
(Duckworth, per Sydney Book Club). This
is a story of a miner’s family, painstakingly
detailed at such length as to frighten the
frivolous reader. Yet the people are real
people, unforgettable. The author has a
curious disdain for the conventional formula
of the novel. Thus he interests us mightily
in the eldest son and in his love affair, then
casually kills him and allows the girl to drop
out of his narrative. Having disposed of
him, Lawrence takes up a younger son and
makes him the hero. But the construction of
the novel is sound; for the chief character in
the book is the mother, who, disappointed in
her drunken husband, transfers her love in
turn to her sons, and sees all her hopes sud-
denly smitten down in the death of her
eldest born, but finds in the love of her other
son the compensation she had thought for
ever out of her reach. The figure of this
commonplace woman is depicted with an ex-
traordinary impressiveness; and her death
makes the scene of horror hardly to be
matched in any literature except the Rus-
sian. The love affairs of the second son are
told with a frankness that seems innocuous,
surcharged as Lawrence’s realism is with
poetry, and informed throughout with a
keen delight in nature. Indeed, were Law-
rence to learn, as he is learning, to render
his material more submissive to his hands,
to control, the course of his story, he should
some day be regarded as the legitimate suc-
cessor of Thomas Hardy.
The new, cheap edition of Roget’s
Thesaurus (Longmans, Green) places in the
literary neophyte’s hands, for 3s. (in Aus-
tralia) the one indispensable tool for his
craftsmanship. It was in 1852 that Dr.
Roget published his first Thesaurus, and,
till this present edition, the work had been
.reprinted from the 1855 edition with little
alteration. His son has now enlarged the
work and brought it up to date, with a new
and elaborate index. A dictionary is of less
use to the writer than a Thesaurus; for the
problem which a dictionary purposes to solve
is this: The word being given, to find its
signification. In a Thesaurus the problem
is the converse: The idea, being given, to
find the words to express that idea. The
problem solved by the dictionary is a
reader’s problem: that solved by the
Thesaurus is a writer’s problem.
The regulations framed for the conduct of
the Australian National Song competition,
by the Musical Association of' N.S.W., to
whom Farmer and Co. presented £lOO for a
set of verses, comprise: The song must not
exceed 40 lines; the verses must not
have hitherto been published, and must be
“in pure English, free from colloquialisms
or slang” ; each sheet of MS. must bear a
nom de plume for identification purposes,
but must not have the writer’s name; a
postal note, or stamps, for 55., a sealed
envelope containing the name and pen-name
of the competitor, and bearing the pen-name
on the outside of the envelope, must accom-
pany the MS., the package to be registered
and addressed: “National Song Competi-
tion.” the Hon. Secretary, the Musical Asso-
ciation of N.S.W., 16 Paling’s Buildings,
Ash-street, Sydney, and forwarded to reach
that address by September 30. Competitors
submitting more than one entry must follow
these directions for each entry, including a
separate entrance fee of ss. MS. will not be
returned, and the sealed envelopes will be
destroyed. The adjudicators are: Profs.

“V. V.’s EYES”
(By the Author of “Queed”)
Henry Sydnor Harrison in “V.V.’s Eyes” has achieved a brilliant success. As
delightful, as patient, and as human as “Queed,” but far stronger and more moving.

The Inky Way.
J. M. Le Sage, managing editor of London Daily
Telegraph, has completed half a century of con-
tinuous service on that paper, and has had to un-
dergo the usual dinner and silver salvers. At the
dinner he reminisced about his early reporting ex-
periences. He beat “Billy” Russell, of the Times,
in the race to get the first news to London of the
fall of Paris and the entry of the Germans. He got
first news of the death of Lord Palmerston, Prime
Minister, and he reported the last speech of Richard
Cobden. He was the friend of George Augustus
Sala—remembered in Australia for his rubicund nose,
his dreary lecturing, and his failure to turn up at
the Melbourne Yorrick Club dinner in his honor.
Whether Sala fell asleep at Menzies’ or was otherwise
incapable of attending was never definitely ascer-
tained. H. M. Stanley was also an intimate friend.
After Stanley had found Livingstone, Le Sage asked
him whether he had any other big job in mind. He
replied: “Yes, a big journey of exploration through
darkest Africa.” Lord Burnham, who owns the
Telegraph, asked the cost. Stanley named a figure
(it turned out to be £20,000 short of the actual).
Burnham acquiesced, and the “Darkest Africa” affair
was fixed up in three minutes.
From London: The Era —generally known in Lon-
don as the Actor’s Bible —announces that in future
its price will be a penny instead of the old sixpence.
This must be one of the most sudden reductions on
journalistic record. It also changes its publishing
day from Saturday to Wednesday, thereby gaining
24 hours on its rival, the Stage, which comes out
on Thursday. The idea evidently is to get square
by a more vigorous pursuit of the nimble advt.
“J. 8.”: Dropped a well-worn pen at Auckland
(M.L.) lately, P. H. Robertson, fine old pressman.
Starting as so many good men have done, from the
mechanical side, he made himself a master of short-
hand (his note was as beautiful as a high-school
girl’s first love letter), and developed a style of writ-
ing rarely seen in these days of hurry-up. Dong ago,
in Sydney, when his friend Horace Rogers, of the
Herald, was a young blood about town, there was
no great distance to go with the diploma for the
most concise paragraphists and law reporters. They
worked much in line. After courts, Rogers supplied
dramatic criticism and “Robbie” musical criticism.
And age did not rust Robertson in that line. Not
many years back he drifted on to Wellington (M.L.)
Times, and did for that harassing paper many a
criticism that astonished musicians of world-wide
reputation who had expected to meet with outland-
ish do-re-mi ignorance, and were blessedly disap-
pointed.
“Naumai”: Peter Robertson, the well-known
Maoriland pressman, who died at Auckland a few
days ago, commenced as a comp, in that city, and
at one period “snatched stamps” for John Ballance
on the Wanganui Herald. After drifting to the
writing side of the business, he roamed over a
good deal of Australasia, and the old hands at
Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and various other vil-
lages on both sides of the Tasman still enthuse over
his musical criticisms. Lemare, the organist, stated
that Robertson’s notices of his recitals were the best
from the musical point of view that had been printed
in Australasia. ,
Another inky wayfarer with a long and profitable
record draws off the Sydney track when W. J.
Bailey goes to Hobart presently. Somewhere about
15 years ago he joined S. M. Herald and helped to
keep the wolf at a reasonable distance from Mr.
James’s doorstep. After about seven years’ struggle
with the animal he skied his inkpot amid general
lamentations, and took over the publicity work of
Farmer’s, Ltd., further up the street. He remained
there until a few days ago, when he decided to go
into business for himself and ascertain how it felt
to collect all the dividends.
The Smart Set (U.S.) for July contains an Aus-
tralian feature. It describes a journey down the
Murray, the hero being the author, R. M. Hallett, and
contains bales of local color. Also, there is a con-
signment of “cuckoo borroughs,” whose idiotic cackle
startled the hero so that he became considerably
annoyed. That’s the worst of these cursed, small
local-governing bodies.
* * * *
A Canterbury (M.L.) man lately wrote a note re-
garding the scarcity of lambs in that province, and
remarked: “This shortage is attributed to the high
mortality among the ewes.” But the comp, knew
better, and left out the first “t” in mortality.”
In the same spirit, when the lady reporter wrote of
a wedding, “The bridesmaids’ dresses were modelled
from a picture of Laurence’s,” the comp, altered it
to “muddled,” and got much nearer the truth.
A new novel of Fleet-street, “Outside The Ark,”
by Mrs. Adelaide Holt, has some cynical remarks on
journalism by a successful editor. The only sure
way with a Woman’s Page is to have it written by a
man. “Don’t have a woman, or you will find your
page will be exactly like every other Woman’s Page
in London. Women are such damned sheep, bless
’em.” The writer, who wants to pose as prophet
must get notoriety first. “Go out and dance per-
petually in the limelight an indecorous can-can, if
you want people to appreciate the spirituality of
the article you are yearning to write for a great
quarterly review. That’s journalism.” And a class
to which so many Australian writers really prefer to
belong is scornfully dismissed as “That well-known
product of the journalistic farmyard who calls him-
self a free lance, while his friends call him a
failure.”
NEXT FEDERAL ELECTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I mot him at the house of Bung,
And bought him Bacchic fire.
He seemed a most deserving case,
Dull care was stamped upon his face,
And want, and sorrow dire ;
Worst thing of all, it did appear
11c took no pleasure in his beer 1
“What ails you, brother?” I inquired.
He blinked and choked a sob.
“It’s all this Labor Government,"
He muttered, “Yes, the blighters went
And made me lose my job.
I used to make five quid, no less,
Each week, by writing to the press!
“My pen-name? I had many, sir.
1 was ‘A Working Man.’
‘Fair Play,’ ‘Pro Bono Publico,’
‘Disgusted Unionist,’ also
‘Non-Union Artisan’ ;
When Lard and Labor were at strife,
I often was ‘A Striker’s Wife’!
“The person on the land opined,
What ‘Farmer’ said was right;
And citizens were much distressed
When ‘Banker’ wrote that interest
Was high, and money tight!
When I held forth as ‘City Man,’
I nvestors grabbed their cash and ran !
“Now I am silent. If I wrote,
I’d have to sign each day!”
Quoth I: “My friend, don’t think me rude
Your silence will be misconstrued ;
Your enemies will say:
‘To sign his name he can’t afford,
For lie’s a liar and a fraud !’ ”

A Splendid Tribute to the
Great Nerve Medicine,
CLEMENT?
TONIC
How It Cured Loss of
Sleep and Neuralgia.
19 Bourke Street, Launceston,
December 7, 1911.
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“My restoration to health by the
aid of Clements Tonic was little
short of marvellous.
i 'mm m
“For two years I suffered dreadfully from Neuralgia and Insomnia.
The neuralgic pains were aggravated by my not being able to sleep. My
appetite left me, and I became so weak that I was unable to work, my hands
and limbs trembled and shook so, I thought my end had come. During
that time I was under medical treatment. I also tried various reme-
dies, and still kept getting worse. One day a friend gave me half a bottle
of Clements Tonic to try. The result was so good that I took a course.
My health improved rapidly, and I was soon free from my complaints
and felt splendid.
“T am a native of this city, and scores of my friends can vouch for
the truth of this statement. You may make what use you wish of this,
(Signed) SAMUEL COULTASS.”
Mr. COULTASS, of Launceston, is well known. Other testimonies prove the wonderful value
of this great Nerve and Blood Medicine in all cases of Nervous Breakdown, Weakness, Indigestion,
Insomnia or Loss of Sleep, Sluggish Liver, Melancholia or Depression of Spirits, Sick and Ner-
vous Headache, or Weakness after Fever or Illness. Send for it.

Tho a fi! Dg through the menu bored her.
Ihen the waiter coughed (aside),
bravely bowed and took t'he order.
Wever had more lovely lips
bent h»i o£f for Fish and Chips.
Though the girl looked wondrous fair
j Ssiied her boa sable,
Ked I blushed, and feigned to stare
July at the supper table.
What a bust, and waist and hips !
V\ hat a queen for Fish and Chips !
“Penny for your thoughts,” said she,
‘Coodness! What have you been
drinking?”
Two fine eyes she turned on me,
yue of them serenely winking.
(h ull I'd been of merry quips
Fre she ordered Fish and Chips.)
Not a word could I reply,
But my silence did not matter.
Dainty feeders, seated nigh,
r „. Gr l i . nned - methought, at Polly’s chatter,
iingling to my finger tips
Still I mused on Fish and Chips.
Burdened with a sense of shame,
How was I to be amusing?
Polly (what an awful name!)
Put my silence down to boozing.
All her vulgar verbal slips
Harmonised with Fish and Chips.
Beauty ripe as hers could tempt
Stoics into sinful follies
(Bishops are not quite exempt
From the risk of charms like Polly’s) ;
My romance was torn to strips
By her flippant “Fish and Chips.”
If, when supping & la carte,
Passion’s last surviving ember
Flickers feebly in my heart
And my bygones I remember,
Like the lash of cruel whips
Comes the thought of “Fish and Chips.”

Gippslanu Gullies.
Wind waves over the white cloud ridges,
Wan noon over the timber’s crest.
Tangled bracken and hop-scrub yellow
Whispering weirdly in deep unrest.
For the bush sprite brushes their silent cover
By stealthy tracks where the dews drip
white,
By gleaming holes in the crooked cutting
And gullies dipped in a wedge of light.
Lonely and sad I hear her calling,
And one w:ld lover —the creek —sings back
From steep dipped gullies where gum blooms
dropping
Ripple the moons in his deep, wet track.
But she flits away in a whispered fancy
And drifts in light by the whimpering
shrub.
And peers through boughs of the wind-
washed wattles
And ghost-white blooms in the cauliflower
scrub.
And down by the mounded trunks uprooted
She dips her feet in the well’s white flume,
By a floating web of misted silver
Flung in the fronds of the king fern’s
plume.
By dim locked archway and saplings bended
She flits in phantoms of drifted light....
By wilted bark on the big trunks tapping
And boughs a-throb to the pulse of night.
But hours wane dim in the deep fern gullies,
And cometh the mysteries the shadows
teach ;
For the moon’s white wreck on the ridge is
dipping
Her drifting hull on a cloud-washed beach.
And fainter and farther the bush sprites
singing,
And lonelily lilting it dies away.
Till only she whispers to white stars ebbing
Through deen locked branches and trunks
dawn-gray.
And she sinks like a nun by the Holy Chalice,
And kneels in silence awhile to pray
To the Host aflame on an azured altar,
Shrined in the love of the White God, Day.

Morning.
Night slowly dies ; the changing skies
With wondrous hues its death are scorn-
ing.
Dawn breaks, and all the little pieces
Go into morning.
A soft breeze freshly from the seas
Wakens the world. Within my mind
A thought stirs: Would I, like the dawn,
Could raise the wind !
A lark soars upward to the sky
And trills its joy to meet the sun ;
I feel that way, too, for the dawn
Is full of fun.
Yes, there is morning in my heart.
And care is no more in my mind;
For all my troubles with the night
Are left behind.
Left far behind where trouble may
Seek me again, and yet again ;
Knock at the door or climb the backyard
fence,
But all in vain!
Thus in my heart the worth of dawn
Sung much by poets, well is proved ;
For morning finds me in a suburb new
That is, I’ve moved.
Fresh seems the morning with its breeze;
Fresh hopes from dawn mv bosom gets ;
Fresh thoughts I think, and right in front
of me
Are long, fresh debts.

BE A ROBUST WOMAN!
If you wish to possess that feminine magnetism that draws men and women,
you must possess figure, and a good bust-firm and well-rounded—is the first
essential; well-rounded arms, a nicely-turned neck, and a full (even if plain)
face will, combined, give you an advantage socially over your pretty-faced but
scraggly and poorly developed friends.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightful fulness of the feminine form
that captivates, and it is the woman who is most correctly developed who
monopolises the endearments and attentions of the opposite sex.
By following our advice, thousands of weak, thin, run-down, ansemic
women, positively devoid of the semblance of bust development, many suf-
fering from functional internal disorders, constipation, biliousness, weak
stomach, aching back, and some of the various other complaints that make
women miserable, have been restored to robust health, and now possess
full, well-rounded, correctly-developed figures. Let us tell you, absolutelv
free of charge, how you may accomplish the same result. Send a2d

If you suffer from Varicose Veins or Ulcers, or both, I believe that I can
completely cure you. I have treated hundreds of terrible cases with the utmost
success, and I know that but very few cases are really incurable. Ve-w few doc-
tors tell you they can cure this trouble. They prefer to ignore it Doctors could
not cure me. I cured myself. I then cured my friends, and then made hundreds
of new friends by curing people who had suffered in some cases for a quarter of
a century. Hence I believe I can cure you It will pay you well to fully inves-
tigate my method.
My treatment is applied at your own home, does not require you to lay up
and is painless and harmless. The worst cases usually respond inside the first few
weeks, and old, stubborn cases are perfectly cured under a suitable course of treat-
ment Give me full details of your case. If I can cure you I will say so and
send you a guarantee. If I cannot, I will at once advise vou. You run no’ risk
You can lose nothing if I should fail; but I have built up a large business not’
on failures, but on successes in eases formerly given up as hopeless. Let me send
you hundreds of grateful testimonials.

Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort.

Liver or Kidney Disease.

How Ho Address 'Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

fused.

THE GROWING DEPRESSION IN
AUSTRALIA —ALSO SOME RE-
MARKS ABOUT A PERSIAN KING.
Tiie above-mentioned animal—the Depres-
sion, not the Persian King—which has
hardly been alluded to (in Sydney, at all
events) for eight or nine years, has, again
become a subject of conversation. There
seems to be a sort of falling-off everywhere.
The usually-crowded pub is- a little less
crowded, and consequently the, .blue ruin is
served with greater alacrity. The fatted
demoiselle at the tea-room is a trifle more
prompt with the Irish stew, and a shade less
arrogant with her eye, through the falling
off in trade. The expensive barber has a
man waiting for a customer instead of six
customers waiting for a man. from which
it is inferred that the individual who used
to have a shave, face massage, singe, sham-
poo and expert opinion on his pimple now
does with a shave alone, and. takes up only
a quarter the time that he used to do. The
shipping trade is not so good as it was. The
bank manager inclines to go down on all
fours in front of the new depositor and to
fix an eye of scorn on the person who wants
an advance, whereas he once did the reverse.
And, as already mentioned, there is a tend-
ency, which has not been noticeable for quite
a number of years, to talk about the Depres-
sion. At the same time there is a great
effort (so far as Sydney is concerned) to set
down the sudden and visible slump to the
small-pox epidemic, and thus shift the re-
sponsibility off the shoulders of man, and
plant it beside the throne of God, it being a
pleasant, easy-going theory that all diseases
are the invention of the Almighty. But an
epidemic which has been raging for months
without (up to the date when this was
written) killing a single white inhabitant is
hardly to be taken seriously. Certainly it
isn’t to be taken as the reason why people
begin talking about the Depression as if it
were a familiar spectre and a constant
haunter of the Cornstalk highways. New
South Wales, despite its small-pox epidemic,
has almost the lowest death-rate in the
world. In these circumstances it is absurd
to profess that business is falling off because
the Shadow of Death is hanging over the
Ma State’s capital.
* * * *
The fact is that the great bulk of the com-
munity suffers from shortage of memory.
One of the wisest among Asiatic kings,
Darius, of Persia, made a note of this fact,
so he hired a man to remind him three times
a day that the soldiery of Athens had made
things unpleasant for him, and had dragged
his pomp and his banner in the dust. This
was to prevent him letting his military
establishment fall into decay, and to remind
him that it comported with his dignity to
get square with the City of the Violet Crown
before he died. Australia, and especially
New South Wales, lacked the foresight to en-
gage a person of that sort. It might be
good for the State and the Commonwealth if,
every day on which Parliament was sitting,
the legislative proceedings commenced with a
brief address from a tall, thin person attired
in tight-fitting black, and painted to represent
a skeleton. He should explain to the as-
sembled legislators that the drought will
come again, even if it doesn’t run according
to Clement Wragge’s timetable; that the
sheep and ca ttle will one day die ; that the
crops will one day diminish ; that the Lon-
don money market will slump; that the old
loan will fall due and the new loan become
scarce; that the interest rate will rise, and
the land boom will fall, and the wild cat
will become thin about the ribs for want of
food; and that it isn’t possible for local
wages to go up, and cheap-labor imports to
increase, and high-wage local exports to
diminish, without some kind of a breakage.
In fact, he should remind the politicians that
men and booms are alike mortal. Then he
might justly add that invasion and rapine
will come in time, for they come to every
country in time ; and that the country which
prefers to import foreign goods, instead of
building ud its defences by importing the
people who make the goods, is living in a
fool’s paradise. And, having spoken his
daily warning, this hired apparition would
gather up his skull and cross-bones, his
coffin, his tombstone, his hatchment, his
black flag, his. cypress tree, and the other
apparatus of his job, and depart silently by
the back door. After that he would get into
h waiting hearse and retire with dignity to
his home (painted black) alongside the ceme-
tery.
The value of a stipendiary Solomon
Eagle .would depend on the amount of atten-
tion paid to his words. Certainly he wouldn’t
lack for words in Australia, and especially
in New South Wales, if he knew his sub-
ject. The State Government—the unspeak-
able Holman-McGowen-Griffith combina-
tion —has closed the financial year with a
shortage of £1,228,385—50me estimates put
it at over £1,(300,000. This is despite the
fact that it had the biggest revenue which a
New South Wales Ministry ever enjoyed,
that it cut down the payments to the public
works fund, the closer settlement fund and
the sinking fund, and that it borrowed on a
wholly unprecedented scale. The situation
is almost hopeless, according to present
methods, and it is impossible to propound
any scheme for putting the finances square
which won’t involve a huge and unpopular
increase of taxation, or a vast and unpopular
cutting down of the easy-going, casual, af-
fable system of expenditure on which the
Harold Skimpole Government, or Ministry
of All the Unreliables, depends for votes. So,
as the present New South Wales Legislature
must presently expire through effluxion
of time, the Holman-McGowen-Griffith
crowd proposes to present no formal finan-
cial statement whatsoever, unless it is driven
to it. by public, opprobrium. It won’t say
definitely how it got into the present mess,
or how it intends to get out of it, or how it
proposes to prevent next year’s mess being as
bad. or perhaps worse. It will make a few
perfunctory remarks, and then invite the
electors to take a leap in the dark. In
gambling parlance, they will be requested to
“go it blind.” If they answer to the call
and send the Holman-McGowen-Griffith
aggregation back to office, the new Legisla-
ture will meet when the financial year is
about half-finished. It will be too late to
repair the wreck for the year which ends
on oOth June, 1914, and the crowd of impos-
sible muddlers will probably be anchored to
its. job till the end of 1916, no matter what
ruin and confusion it brings about. There
is every reason to believe that the crowd in
question wouldn’t have a hope if it told the
country in detail, before the election, either
how many men it was going to sack, or how
many salaries it was going to cut down, or
how many works it was going to hang up, in
order to reduce the expenditure to the level
of the income, or how many new taxes it
proposed to put on in order to raise the in-
come to the level of the expenditure. So
it intends, so far as any formal Budget is
concerned, to build up a masterly silence.
Incidentally, it pleads as an excuse for the
monetary downfall, that the subsidy from the
Australian Treasury is less than it used to
be. That is certainly true, but Queensland
and Victoria and S. Australia and Westralia
have -suffered from the same disadvantage,
and they haven’t made the heroic smash that
the Ma State—alleged to be the richest
of all —has made under the control of
Holman, McGowen, Griffith and co. And
the decline in the Commonwealth subsidy has
nothing to do with the fact that the big
profit formerly earned by the State railways
has turned into a deficit; that the tram-
ways are not looking so well as they did ;
that the State Government is offering its
friend Bull-Cohen of England high inter-
est for comparatively small loans, where it
used to get big loans at fairly low interest;
or that the State is littered with unfinished
lines which were started in a spirit of joyful
over-night drunkenness, and repented of
when the morning brought an aching head
and partial sanity and a vision of empty
bottles.
Though the trouble is worst in New
South Wales, because New South Wales has
hired the worst gang of spendthrifts and
political profligates to run its affairs, the
fact remains that the affairs of Australia in
general are not so gorgeous as they were.
Whether the trouble arises out of scarce
rainfall, or accident, or the cussedness of
inanimate objects, it is certain that the sheep
and cattle, which constitute a very large
part of the country’s wealth, are again
diminishing. A large section of New South
\\ ales and S. Australia is visibly drying up.
The mineral output grows less. The loans
are harder to get and cost more.
Immigration is not so brisk. There is a
tall not only in bank deposits, but in the
banks cash reserves. Agriculture isn’t ex-
panding as it should do. Under the ab-
surdly inefficient tariff the foreign imports
are still very much larger than the country
can honestly afford to pay for. Everything
in the way of finance, loans, faith, “froth,
boom, lOU, swelled head and unpaid-for
pomp is on too big a scale as the result of
the sanguine Australian temperament and
10 years of good fortune. Everything in
the way of plain, hard work and plain self-
reliance is on too small a scale. This coun-
try would do well to read up the history
of Darius, son of Gusiitasp, the great king
who hired a civil servant to remind him
three times daily that he had once been
badly licked, so that he might not acquire
undue magnificence of the cranium in his
prosperity and begin to think himself im-
mortal._ As a result of this sane outlook
upon life Darius was a very successful
ruler. On fhe other hand a Holman or a
Nebuchadnezzar is liable to go mad with
political inflation, and be chased out into
the paddock at last to eat grass.
THE PARTY GOVERNMENT BLIGHT
IN ITS RELATION TO THE N. S.
WALES CIVIL SERVICE.
This is the sermon of ‘TO-2-4.” :
Some day someone of a statistical turn of mind
will begin a calculation of the number of curses
which the different Australian States suffer from
as the outcome of their adherence to the Party
Government system. He will never finish. The
subject is too vast. There is hardly a political ill
that does not arise directly or indirectly from this
rotten old device. Take, for example, a clamant
scandal—the present condition of the Civil Service
in N. S. Wales. From the earliest ages the Civil
otTv ice has been used as a handy dumping-ground
for the friends, dependents and hangers-on of the
politicians in power for the time being. In the
days of plural voting a man with 10 or a dozen
votes who was in need of a little ready money could
always command a job as public service commis-
sioner from the Ministry that was in power, in his
new capacity he inquired earnestly into some utterly
immaterial question; drew a fee' of £lOO or
1000 ; and later returned to private life happy
and solvent. The sort of man who not only had
half a dozen or more votes of his own, but who
controlled perhaps 30 or 40 other votes, was in a
position to aspire after a permanent billet; and if
so disposed he mostly got it. Since, in the nature
of things, about 90 per cent, of these appointments
were made cynically irrespective of merit, the Ser-
vice ultimately reached deplorable depths in the
way of incapacity and leisureliness. So far as most
of its members were concerned, life was always
afternoon—and five o’clock p.m. at that. The thing
became a scandal. In the early ’Bo’s Pakkes who
had himself appointed as many wasters to fat billets
as any other man, created the Public Service Inquiry
Commission. The Commission was composed of re-
putable and able men. Their duty was to identify
and, where possible, gently to oust the more glaring
incompetents; and especially to see that such new
men as were appointed had some sort of a claim on
their billets. The Commissioners quickly discovered,
to their fury, that they were meant to be ciphers!
No incompetents were shifted. All their suggestions
were blandly disregarded by the Government.
1 olitically influential nonentities continued to be
shoved into the Service by Ministers and Ministers’
friends. In brief, the abuses of the old regime
raged as briskly as ever. Much to the annoyance
of Parkes, the then Premier, James Watson, Chair-
man of the Commission, hurriedly and very firmly
resigned. The Commission carried on for a while,
but it was hopelessly discredited. The time had be-
come obviously ripe for the handing of some fresh
sop to scandalised public opinion.
It was at about this stage that the Public Service
Board was established. The original idea was that
it should be entirely free from political influence.
The good old wooden-headed elector had this point
inserted into his intellect with considerable force.
Of course, he began by believing the yarn He
always does. The fact is that the Board has never
been free from political influence, and, under the
existing system, never can be. Sometimes the
Board is more under the thumb of Ministers, and
sometimes it is less so ; but always they have a large
share in its activities. When elections are far away
on the distant horizon, or when the party in power
feels absolutely sure of getting back again by a
commanding majority, the tendency is to run things
on what may be termed the level, more or less. But
in every case where votes are badly needed and the
chance of an appoinlment looms, the candidate’s
eligibility for the billet is decided almost entirely
by a consideration of how much support he
is likely to bring to the party in power. The effect
on the State, so far as the value of the services
rendered is concerned, may be gi ged by estimating
the sort of bank manager or , -captain or inter-
national cricketer a country would get if each man
were selected not because of his merits in any one
of these lines of effort, but on the basis (sav) that
he had made more motor-trips to Manly Beach than
any of his competitors, or had read more issues of
the S. M. Herald, or was distinguished by some-
thing else equally immaterial. It is related of a
fine and particularly frank old N. S. Wales citizen
that, on being tackled by a friend concerning his
invariable custom of appointing near relatives to
the best billets at his command, he expressed the
view that it was both natural and right to give
preference to one’s own. The friend said doubtfully:
“Well, other things equal, I suppose it is.” “Other
things equal, be damned,” said the ancient, spiritedly.
“I’d give a relative a job as against a genius.” The
fact that something closely resembling this attitude
has alwavs been in vogue amongst N.S.W. politicians,
as regards the Civil Service, has done a lot to make
it the pleasaunce of mediocrity which it notoriously
is.
Another powerful factor in the same direction is
the seniority system. An immutable and likewise
imbecile rule lays it down that if a member of the
Service isn’t incompetent to an absolutely flaming
extent, he shall be preferred, in the matter of ap-
pointments, to any outsider, no matter how brilliant.
The politicians—Liberal or Labor—wouldn’t dare to
alter this state of affairs, if they could. The senior
of a department who was not appointed to a charge
position whieh tradition had previously informed
him was to be his, could, by influencing juniors and
the like, lose the party that was responsible for
slighting him a heap of votes. So the party
lies low on the weather bow in all such cases, and
refrains from interfering, even when the most ah-
surdly foolish old gentlemen rise to the dizziest of
official pinnacles by the mere effluxion of time ii
is hardly necessary to stress the fact that such «
demented arrangement does not prevail in ant
other walk of life. In commerce and in the uro
fessions venerable age counts for nothing by com
panson with brains. Even in the'naval and military
services there are careful provisions for the ejecting
of the futile and the unfit. The haberdashery firm
which, as a matter of course, elevated its oldest
floor-walker to the position of general manager
would automatically begin to render itself
ripe for the Bankruptcy Court. The newspaper
which was habitually edited by the most ancient
man in the building would soon burst. The hotel
which transferred the barman to the office merelv
because he had been employed about the premises
longer than anyone else would pine and die. Such
propositions are plain to the dullest intelligence
The Civil Service of N. S. Wales (and of the other
States as well) is full, figuratively speaking, of
general managers who should be floor-walkers’ or
nothing; it is creeping with editors who are fit
only to sweep out the office; and it fairly teems
with hotel-managers who should never have aspired
to anything higher than the honest, forthright toil
of pulling beer. There is hardly one first-rate man
in the whole vast institution. The slackness and
casualness and splendid indifference to such trifles as
time and the public convenience which prevail on
all sides, fill the normal man with a paralysed sur-
prise that is akin to reverence. It is all so different
from the eager, hasty scuffling methods of ordinary'
life. Energy, drive, initiative, administrative ability,
commercial and financial knowledge—all are lacking’
to an astonishing degree in the N. S. Wales Civil
Service. It is not too much to say of many of its
highly-paid officers that, if they were cast sudden]'’
upon the grim mercies of that outside world of
which they know' so little, they would'have a parlous
job of it to connect wiyj, a junior clerkship.
To put the position in plain terms, N. S. Wales
(and the anguished old Mother State is merely cited
as an example; the other States being in much the
same plight) is paying the majority of its public ser-
vants heavily for work which is either not being
done at all, or which is being done extremely badly.
Thirtv-odd years ago it awoke to an understanding
of something of the sort. It is now up to it to
awake again. The Board system has proved a fail-
ure. The wisest move would probably be for the
Government to select some first-class man; appoint
him Commissioner over the entire service ; and make
him as completely independent of political pressure
as the present. Chief Railway Commissioner is. He
would need to be intimately acquainted with local
conditions and personalities, and hence would re-
quire to be of local origin or upbringing. He would
be instructed to make all appointments to the ser-
vice on purely business lines ; that is to say, promo-
tion would depend not on age but upon capacity.
From the beginning of the new regime applicants for
position in the Service would be clearly told, on
joining, that their promotion to charge or semi-
charge billets would be dependent purely on their
merits. The Civil Service would thus cease gradually
to be a sort of charitable institution devoted largely
to the housing of the friends of the party in power';
and the State would begin to be governed on some-
thing the same lines as a well-run business venture.
The present crowd of Service incompetents—the
combined result of the efforts of dozens of different
administrations to keep in power—would be gradually
eliminated. But there is a lion in the path, and a
reef in the fairway And the name of the obstruc-
tion is, in each instance, Party Government—the
imported imposture which everybody deplores, but
which no politician appears to have sufficient nerve
to tackle.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Australia’s Cool North.
The Railways Investigation Committee,
which is now exploring the Northern Terri-
tory, has been heard from, and the news is
cheering. It hasn’t got a very long distance
yet, but it has travelled as far as Bitter
springs, which is about 200 miles or less
hom the coast. So, in theory, these
OoLUMBUSES-by-land have only begun to
climb on to the tableland and aren’t half-
way, or a quarter-way, up the roof of Aus-
tralia. There are, as the crow flies, 700
more miles of gradual ascent to be nego-
tiated before they reach the inward top of
this country. Yet even on the road to Bitter
Springs they speak of cold nights (down to
degrees) ; cool days (down to 40 deg-
rees), “ideal weather” and an almost com-
plete absence of flies and mosquitoes.
Also they enthuse over the good condition
of the cattle and the high promise of the
soil. This is along the route which would
be followed by a really central railway ex-
tending from Port Darwin in the north to
Port Augusta and Adelaide in the south.
The average unthinking person, whose edu-
cation is based on the daiiy paper, requires
to be spoken to on the head with an axe to
make him realise that Australia owns a
high, vast pleasant—sometimes very chilly
region in the Territory ; that it has in its
centre a huge cluster of hills with a rainfall
and a fairly good river system; and that
most of this central region, if it were opened
up by a railway, would be an ideal land for
the best class of European immigrant. All
he knows, or thinks he knows, at present is
the temperature of low-lying Port Darwiu
and a flowerpot-full of land adjacent thereto.
Certainly if the party which wants to drag
everything to the biggest centres of popula-
tion has. its way, and the transcontinental
railway is taken round at great extra mile-
age and cost through the hot, dry, depressed
regions of western N.S.W. and Queensland,
and nailed down to almost-desert country
like that around Broken Hill —in that case
the great fertile tableland and the inland
mountain groups might as well, for the pre-
sent, be . non-existent. But however that
may be, it is up to Australia to remember
that it owns the place, and that the place is
everything . which the nigger-labor crowd
says it isn’t. It is a white man’s land if
the white man is regarded as a low-tempera-
ture animal, and it has no special points
for Ram Rhag and his brother Ghoeab
Turban. The local citizen wants these
facts gummed in his hat, notified on his bed-
room wall, printed on his tram ticket, men-
tioned to him at church, inscribed on his
wash-bill and specified on the label of his
whisky bottle. And then the news might at
last soak in upon him and do him good.

The Corpse on the Doorstep.
The recent maternity bonus frauds trial in
Melbourne disclosed the unpleasant fact that
at an unregistered private hospital (regis-
tration had been refused, but apparently it
was nobody’s business to see that the law
wasn’t defied) at least three mothers of ille-
gitimate children had parted with their
infants at birth to persons of whose names
and addresses they were ignorant. And
one of the three gave away £3O along with
the incubus. Under the Vic. Infant Life
Protection Act all such trafficking in babies
is illegal. Meanwhile, however, unregis-
tered private hospitals flourish, and newl.v-
born babies continue to be handed over to


unknown foster-parents—and no questions
asked. Is it any wonder that citizens going
home through quiet streets at night are
perpetually stumbling over deceased infants?
The child is born in a “hospital” over which
there is no State supervision ; the mother
mostly bears an assumed name, and the
child, which is registered under that bogus
name, is untraceable. In fact, there is no
certainty that it is registered under any
name, or that it ever achieved a legal
existence. It is born —and “adopted” ; and
that is the end of it. The whole business
suggests a calculated, organised system of
murder winked at by the State. The un-
identifiable dead babies, which have been
found so often of late, are proof of it. So
the State that urgently needs population
that pays away thousands of pounds yearly
to get an inferior class, deliberately permits
the waste —to put it delicately—of hundreds,
if not thousands, of the most virile, acclima-
tised and otherwise desirable lives obtain-
able. A State Foundling Hospital—an in-
stitution where the mother who, from fear
of obloquy, from financial necessity or other-
reasons, finds herself compelled to part with
her baby, could leave the incubus in peace
and safety—would obviate an incalculable
amount of murder, misery and sundries. And
it would be of more benefit to Australia than
four George Reids or 40 Percy Hunters.
What valid objection is there to the found-
ing of a State Foundling Home —or, rather,
a lot of them, scattered over the country?
A Parson Who Appears to be Maligning
Himself.
The Rev. Yarrington, of Sydney, had some
more to say, last week, on the subject of
Sydney’s alleged opium-dens, and his own
reticence as to their whereabouts :
“I consider,” he told the press, “that it is not my
duty as one who works in and about the places
where opium smoking is carried on to inform the
authorities of their (the dens’) existence, and I
think Mr. Flowers should recognise my position in
that respect. My duties as a worker in the slums
°f Sydney take me to places where I know opium
smoking is engaged in, and if I acted as Mr. Flowers
wishes, the good work done by me and my band of
workers would be greatly hindered.”
Opium-smoking is, perhaps, the most per-
nicious of vices. It ruins its victims more
quickly and more completely than any form
of gambling. Alcoholism is nothing to it as
a tyome-, mind-, soul- and body-wrecker. By
comparison with it, Sabbath breaking, bad
language, irreverence in church, and the
Praictice of flirting in choirs are mere venial
sins. Unless every line that one is able to
get from Biblical, doctrinal and ecclesiastical
sources is hopelessly wrong the confirmed
opium-smoker is a thousand to one on
chance for Gehenna. Regarded from the-
purely material aspect he is a certainty

vast section of the flock which has no taste

that in order that he may continue, un-
nampered, to try and save souls from drink
and the like, it is up to him to leave souls
to be ruined by opium, and to perpetuate a
state or aflairs which is certain to cause
other souls to be so ruined, puts him on a
level, in the eyes of those who do not reason
along parsonical lines, with an accessory to
a very dreadful crime. With just as much
justice he might argue that for fear of ham-
pering his work” he is conscientiously
bound to conceal from the authorities the
whereabouts of a coining plant, or an illicit
distillery, or a school for masked burglars,
or a nest of habitual murderers. The pen-
alty which society, in its wisdom, has im-
posed on the citizen who neglects to inform
the authorities of the existence of a case of
what there is reasonable ground to regard
as small-pox is a £5O fine. What punish-
ment should the Rev. Yarrington be
handed for concealing, not one merely, but
a whole herd of cases of opium-smoking?
The thing would be so vast and ferocious,
if it were fitted to the offence, that it is
kindest to assume, as this paper has pre-
viously done, that the sensational Sydney
cleric knows of no oninm-dens, and that
his loud and tireless blither on the subject
is due chiefly to a yearning for an advt.—
an asset which is just as essential to
modern missionaries as it is to musical-hall
artists.
The Scare that is Moribund; and the
Far More Needed Scare that is Still
Unborn.
For weeks past the Sydney daily papers
have been conducting a strenuous anti-small-
pox crusade. Columns and columns have
been filled with warnings in regard to the
hideous possibilities which face the unvac-
cinated. No reasonable citizen is likely to
object to that. But with the opening of
Parliament and the renascence, so to speak,
of the ever-stimulating Willis and other
happenings of interest, the papers have to a
great extent gone out of the Solomon
Eagle business as regards the small-pox
epidemic. This is quite illogical and wrong.
The people who were vaccinated during last
month needed little persuasion. The 50 per
cent, who have not been operated on so far
require to be frightened most thoroughly and
nagged at with extraordinary assiduity
if they are to be driven to the vac-
cination depots. If there is anything in the
dictum of the Health authorities that Sydney
will not be safe till practically the whole
population has oeen treated, the papers
should be now writing up the menace more
furiously than ever. But the searcher after
strict logic has a way of drawing blank
where these sheets are concerned. Take
their persistent silence on an infinitely
greater and more prevalent horror than
small-pox—namely syphilis. They shrink
from so much as giving the hideous disease
its proper name, preferring with old lady-
like gentility to indicate it, where indication
is absolutely necessary, by means of some
form of polite periphrasis. Syphilis is kill-
ing people every day in every city and in
every fair-sized town in N. S. Wales. Small-
pox has killed no one in N.S.W. to date.
The effects of the complaint which hardly
anybody dares to name are infinitely more
loathsome and agonising than the effects of
the one which everybody discusses as though
it were an old friend. The small-pox con-
valescent is, after a time, incapable of doing
any damage to his neighbor. Sufferers from
the other disease are liable, in certain cir-
cumstances, to be menaces to those with
whom they come in contact for the remainder
of their lives. Small-pox is not hereditary ;
and though it may kill or blind its victim
it rarely afflicts him with subtly dreadful
after-effects. Syphilis is hereditary. It is,
as Brieux has well remarked, above all
else a child-murderer.” Club-footed chil-
dren, hump-backed children, twisted chil-
dren children with ill-shapen skulls and
diseased hips and curved spines and a thou-
sand other physical miseries are so because
one or other of their progenitors was not
nrotected from the syphilis curse. It would
be worth a little plain speech now. merely
to save future generations from having their
innocent lives blasted by this disease. And
then there is the case of the unhappy wretch
who contracts it personally .Locomotor
ataxia, softening of the brain, general
of the insane, and a thousand
dreadful nerve troubles threaten him He
is the worst sort of pariah. . If the
V S Wales small-pox epidemic lasts,
at nt vea ra.e * . ? t«t,on. for
” population will, still remain
unattached ; and if it maintains its present
ack of virulence no one will have died.
How horribly different a. storw sypbflie- will
Kto tell! And the fe.tnre of the bna,-
ness which makes it resemble a sort of joke
is that the doctors have ready to their
hands a means of robbing this scourge of
tu |‘ y three-parts of its terrors. Whether
salvarsan is a lasting cure for acquired
syphilis is a question that cannot be estab-
lished for decades. But that it renders the
person who is treated with it incapable of
spreading infection is now accepted by the
medical profession as a proved fact. ' Why
is not syphilis made a notifiable disease like
diphtheria and the plague? Why is there
no heavy fine imposed on the citizen who
tails to tell the authorities of the existence
°* case of what he has reasonable grounds
to believe to be syphilis, as there is in the
case of the man who helps to hush up a
small-pox incident? One reason is that our
daily press, inspired by a nationally-calam-
ltous spirit of mock modesty, fears to start
an agitation in this matter. It is prepared
to fight small-pox with all the weapons in
its armory ; at syphilis it will not deal one
blow—even as a man might perform feats
of tremendous, daring in regard to a terrier
that was robbing his hen-roost, while know-
ingly leaving his wife and children to be
assassinated in their beds.
A Change that is Arriving too Date.
Various indications point to the intention
ot Melbourne’s reconstructed Harbor Trust
to largely adopt the scheme, outlined in The
Bulletin years ago, whereby the temporary
capital of the Commonwealth would be sup-
plied with an adequate, up-to-date harbor
and port, equipment. The scheme provides
for additional dock and wharf accommoda-
tion ; the reservation of the huge area behind
Fishermen’s Bend for factories, warehouses,
elevator sites, etc.; direct railway communi-
cation between Spencer-street and Port Mel-
bourne, through this now unoccupied land; a
future straight cut between the city and
Hobson’s Bay, and other co-ordinate items.
It is estimated to cost between £3,000,000
and £4,000,000, and the Trust proposes to
spread this outlay over 20 years. The idea
threatens to be effective in creating adequate
port accommodation—the trouble is that
when the accommodation is finally provided
it may not be needed. It would have been
a good and up-to-date policy when The
Bulletin propounded it, but circumstances
have altered since then. It is beginning to
dawn on the country citizens that it is not
exactly, advantageous— to them—to export
everything and import everything through
Melbourne. They see that if exports found
their way to their natural outlet —the near-
est port—considerable saving would be
effected, as well as time, which in this case
is money. Also, in those days the big ships
had not yet arrived. The 12,000-ton mer-
chantman can just scrape through Port
Phillip Pleads and up the long channel to
Melbourne; the 20.000 or 30,000 tonner of
the future Will have to pass by. The Harbor
Trust is dimly aware of this, and proposes
to deepen the entrance and channel —in 15
years—and. judging by the way the big ships
progress, that channel will be out of date
and useless, except for the smaller inter-
state boats, long before then. There is here
a fine chance for the McLEOD-led Vic. Par-
liamentary Country party to justify its
existence and nut in practice its alleged “de-
centralisation” policy. Decentralisation
doesn’t wholly consist in persuading the
State to build grain elevators along existing
lines in the backblocks. or in getting rail-
way repair shops erected at inland stations.
A truer conception of that policy comprises
the construction of railway lines —laid out
on the plan of a tree and its branches—from
every feasible port directly inland, and tap-
ping the country behind it. Of course this
wouldn’t suit Melbourne, but then the
Country party has never been accused of
considering Melbourne, which is not an ade-
quate port for a State, and looks as if it
never would be. Wherefore, the Watt-
Weary Government is advised to ponder
thoughtfully over the Harbor Trust’s scheme.
There is no need to urge it to go slow. Un-
seemlv and leaping haste never has been
one of its faults.
A few words concerning a rise in the price
of bread: —
Another “honorable understanding” has just struck
Melbourne, and a number of the inhabitants are
entering protests and passing resolutions—deeds
which are about as effective as a popgun aimed at a
mausoleum. The trouble concerns the staff of life,
the common, everyday 41b. loaf, for which the
Master Bakers’ Association has decided to charge
7d., as against the 6d. to 6ld. previously charged.
So far, the sole reason given for the increase is the
recent rise in bakers’ wages—-4s. per week of 48
hours. Against this, there are several facts as to
which the Master Bakers haven’t offered any explana-
tion. (1) The average journeyman baker will do
from 18 to 20 bags of flour per week ; as each bag
yields 60 loaves, the rise in price—Id. per loaf —
gives the master baker an increased revenue of
£2 10s. less the employee’s 4s. — £2 65., (2) in
’O9, when the M.B.A price for bread was sld.
to 61d., the Flour Millers’ Association quotation for
flour was £ll 10s. per 20001 b.; to-day it is only
£8 15s. ; (3) certain large bakers who are not of
the M.8.A., especially in closely settled suburbs like
Brunswick and Collingwood, have hitherto charged
no more than 6d., delivered, and have announced
their intention to continue selling at that figure; (4)
when, in ’O9, the relatively high price of flour may
have justified an increase, the huge bakery of the
Civil Service Co-operative Stores at Richmond (Yic.)
was, in a measure, fighting the private bakers, and
would have wiped some of them out had they raised
their prices—to-day the M.B.A. and the C. S. Stores
are working together in a sweetly reasonable frame
of mind that dimly suggests a “horrible under-
standing” ; (5) some of the large city restaurants
and some of the hospitals are still getting bread for
4ld. from associated bakers, while a Government
Gazette, issued since the rise to 7d., contains a
notice accepting a tender for supplying bread to gaols,
lunatic homes, etc., at 4d. per 41b. loaf. Now, if the
bread manufacturer makes Id. per loaf on this con-
tract a paltry 14 per cent.—it follows that he is
netting 100 per cent, on what he sells to the public,
and 100 per cent, is a shade over the odds; (6) not
only is flour 10s. per 20001 b. cheaper than this time
last year, but horse-feed is fully 30 per cent, cheaper,
the decrease far more than counterbalancing the rise
in bakers’ wages. The Associated Master Bakers have,
as stated, maintained a thick silence about these
points; they have merely told the consumer that he
will have to pay 7d. for the future, and, except for
the grumbling, that settles it.
Unless it changes its mind at the last
moment the N.S.W. Ministry is going to
hang a man —one Wright, who did an
obviously-premeditated murder. Yet it has
reprieved most murderers up to date, and
some of them also did the corpse that was
obviously premeditated, and some of them
were much more horrible in their methods
than Wright. Then the fact remains that
Wright was once in a lunatic asylum,
which raises a certain doubt about his men-
tal responsibility, while some of the re-
prieved slayers had never been in an asylum.
It the Government, which commenced its
career by saving Phillips, the most
unpleasant homicide of them all, hangs a
person like Wkight it can’t escape the sus-
picion that it saved Phillips, not on the
merits of his case, but by way of throwing
mud at its predecessors. Of course it may
be that the Government has simply decided
that its methods have been all wrong, and
has resolved, in a general way, to turn over
a new leaf. But if that is so it would be
better to start with the difficult leaf —not
the easy one. Any Minister —even if he
were a nigger Minister with an indigestion
and a wooden leg—could decide to let a man
hang. There is no worry or brain-fag about
that sort of thing.
“Comus” on Ma’s neglected education; —
N.S.W.'s new Minister of Education could put the
crowning touch on a well-spent Ministerial life by
abolishing the secret reports on teachers now sent in
by inspectors. As tilings are, an inspector can
put a very fair report in the Observation Book, and
send in a very different one to the Head Office —and
some of them do. This secret report the Head Office
jealously guards, and the teacher has no hope of find-
ing out where he was struck or why he was struck.
Some newly-made inspectors (and a few old ones, too)
sutler from bloated cranium, and expect, and I am
sorry to say, sometimes get, a certain amount of
adulation from teachers. If this kind of inspector
does not receive some sort of hero-worship—well, it
is safe to assume the secret report will get in some
vigorous work. The syllabus was supposed to confer
the blessing of individuality on teachers ; but, if the
teacher dare show any individuality, contrary to the
fads or fancies of his inspector, the secret report
usually brings him a censure from the 1 Chief, or from
some clerk, who most likely attends to this kind of
business. No straight inspector should fear to put
an adverse report in the Observation Book, if the occa-
sion demands it, and that report, and that only,
should be sent to the Head Office. The teacher
affected would then see which brick had struck him.
The efficiency mark is another sore point with
teachers. We are led to believe there is no such
thing as seniority now; ability is the only thing
that counts. This is a fine, democratic principle;
but, then, the ability is gauged by the “efficiency
mark,” and Heaven knows how that was ob-
tained. Most likely another clerk attends to this
business. In the days when this system was intro-
duced —when fads in plasticene, etc., were boom-
ing, and solid education at a discount—an in-
spector would recommend extra marks for, say, a
plasticene kid milking a plasticene cow. Well, since
then, the plasticene cow has been shot, but the marks
she got for the teacher still remain, and give that
teacher a pull over his senior in classification and
length of service.
Again, in the Department’s mad haste to staff its
High Schools with graduate teachers, it appointed
boys and girls, comparatively speaking, fresh from
the University. The academic qualification of these
teachers is not in question, but they can have , little
teaching experience, as most of their time must
necessarily have been spent in study. Lads of 15. 16
or 17 have thus been placed in the classes of girl-
teachers but a few years older. There is the danger
of effeminacy, and what is most essential, there can
be no character-formation by teachers whose age pre-
vents them from having experience and a knowledge
of men and the world. A high standard of education
among teachers is most desirable: but we are sacri-
ficing too much in Oui worship of an academic degree.
During the first half of 1913 New South
Wales, the maddest State in the Common-
wealth, bought from oversea countries goods
to the value of £14,905.466. and sold goods
to the value of £12,300,466. As N.S.W.
requires to export about £2,500,000 worth
per half-year more than it imports, in order
to cover "the interest on its numerous foreign
debts, this means that it went about
£5,000,000 to the bad inside six months.
Now it is certain that a State with a mere
handful of population can’t go to the Devil
at) the rate of £10,000,000 a year without
presently arriving at the Devil. The State
got to the Devil in 1893, and the poverty, the
starvation, the unemployed processions, the
array of homeless folk who “slept out,” the
pathetic readiness of strong men to work
for 3s. a day, the beggary, the soup-kitchens,
the Government relief works, the array of
tramps along the country roads, the enlpty
houses, the deserted shops, and all the other
elements of depression were terrible to see.
Before 1893, as before 1913, N.S.W. got into
a fatuous habit of relying on foreign loans,
on public works, on insufficiency of local
toil, and on tremendous imports of cheap-
labor goods brought in under an ineffective
tariff. Whether the devil that N.S.W. is
going to in 1913 is a bigger devil than the
one it went to in 1893, no man can tell.
There is now an Australian Parliament
which, being strongly Protectionist, may in-
terfere at the right moment. But N.S.W. is
taking exactly the same road to the Devil
that it did- 20 years ago. ■
The ill-feeling that was caused a few weeks
ago when the Sydney - Ferries refused to
issue season tickets to anyone - who wasn't
prepared to relieve the co. of all responsi-
bility in case of “loss of life; however
caused, whether from any act. default, ne-
glect or error of judgment of masters, etc.,”
isn’t in any way lessened by a recent finding
of the N.S.W. Marine Court. Ten days
before passengers were required to sign this
regulation a collision had occurred between
the Sydney Ferries’ steamer Kosciusko and
a punt, with the result that the punt sauk

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London, Wednesday, 10.50 p.m.
Underwriting arrangements are progressing for the
issue of £1,500,000 worth of New South Wales 4
per cent, stock at 97J.
The original amount was £2,000,000, but this
has been reduced in deference to a strong opinion
in financial circles that loans should be reduced to
the lowest possible figure in present market circum-
stances. —Cable in daily paper.

on the spot. The Court has just found (S.
M, Herald report) :
That the collision was caused primarily by the
default of the master of the Kosciusko in navigating
his vessel without due care. The Court did not deal
with his certificate because he was not in a fit state
of health to be in charge of the vessel, having had
little sleep the previous night.
But it didn’t say a word condemning the
co. for overworking its skippers; so
presumably the co. will go on overworking
its servants because the State Government
hasn’t the energy, or maybe the honestv, to
step in and take a hand, and the Federal
Government has been refused power, by
people who didn’t at the time know any
better. But they are learning.
A Few Words about Ex-Postmaster-
General Frazer.
The Bulletin has received a copy of the
Boulder (W.A.) Evening Star, containing
a report of a speech by ex-Postmaster-
General Frazer. This item was an inter-
esting feature of the report:—
In responding to the vote of thanks accorded to
him on the motion of Messrs. Levetus and Miller,
Mr. I razer said that had the Fisher Government
been returned to power he would probably have been
still their Postmaster-General, despite a statement
in The Bulletin as to his probable retirement.
Some time back he turned down an offer made to the
Government by the Australasian Wireless Syndicate,
which was willing to sell its patent rights for
£45,000. Mr. William Macleod was a member
of that syndicate.
A Voice: Is he any relation to George?
Mr. Frazer: No relation. He was the managing
director of The Bulletin, and since the offer he
referred to, The Bulletin writers could see no
good in Frazer’s Administration.
The Bulletin, which took Mr. Frazer
for a gentleman, is sorry to see him descend
to this sort of thing. The cheapest attitude
a politician can take up is expressed in the
words: “I am such a perfect administrator
that no one can possibly object to me or
criticise me except from motives of personal
corruption.” An especially vile Tory poli-
tician of the larrikin variety used to circu-
late the lie (perhaps he still does so)
that The Bulletin owned a great estate
on the Snowy River, and therefore advo-
cated a Federal capital at Dalgety. Another
had a theory that it owned large properties
about Alice Springs, and therefore supported
the direct transcontinental railway. Pos-
sibly the Devil fancies that the only reason
why the angels can object to him is that
they are envious of his tail. It is a pity
to see Frazer joining in this degradation.
The mahi'ging director of The Bulletin
was not before aware that Mr. Frazer was
responsible for the turning-down of a pro-
position in connection with the Australasian
Wireless Co. and the Marconi Co. He had
accepted Mr. Frazer’s oft-repeated state-
ment, made to the managing director and
others, that he (Frazer) favored the ac-
ceptance of the offer, but was overruled by
his cantankerous colleagues— (Fisher and
others). And the editor is in a position to
say that he never heard of the negotiation
until the ex-P.M.G. began to hold forth
about it. His only objection to the ex-
P.M.G. was based on the fact that, no less
than three times in quick succession, the
Melbourne theatrical notices arrived 24
hours late, and what Melbourne theatrical
notices appeared had to be telegraphed at
the last moment in response to urgent ap-
peals. And the secretary’s only grievance
is that, for several weeks running, he
couldn’t get a sufficient supply of
stamps at Sydney G.P.O. because Frazer’s
department had run dry. However,
Frazer will do a service if he will
show the date of the rejection he
alludes to, and prove by extracts that The
Bulletin changed sides in Federal politics
at that date, or at any other date. Its
hostile comments on the Federal Labor atti-
tude re the tariff, re the Northern Territory
railway route, re the Fisher Government’s
refusal to. consider the mono-rail proposition
(nobody in this office owns any shares in
the mono-rail), re the Federal capital, and
especially the Fisher Ministry’s refusal to
submit the selection of the capital site to a
referendum (this paper doesn’t know
whether Mr. Frazer owns any land at
Yassberra, but it possesses none), re the
lack of any really strenuous effort to nush
on the Federal note circulation (The
Bulletin staff has no more interest in the
Commonwealth Bank than Mr. Frazer has)
—all these things date pretty far back. It
is really up to Mr. Frazer, the gentleman
who apparently thinks that no paper could
criticise, even in the mildest fashion, such
a genius as himself unless one of its share-
holders was filled with personal animosity,
to reconsider his attitude.
“Galleryite” supplies this
Anyone who knew anything of the personalities in
the Reps, would have been glad to bet heavily that
as soon as Willie Kelly got a chance he would start
nosing out non-existent cases of corruption. Cook
should have made him Assistant-Minister for Mare’s
Nests. The N. S. Wales politician would then have
been entirely happy, in the way a person always is
who has discovered his true vocation. For years
Kelly has been seeing wickedness everywhere. A
vast panorama of crime rushes tirelessly past his
scandalised eyes. The figures on this vast canvas
are invariably Laborites. With a shamelessness that
is mad;* in its cynical audacity, these representa-
tives of\ a deluded democracy openly steal, bribe,
plot, boodle, breed wild cats, float bogus companies,
pilfer, burgle, rob, buccaneer, bolt with each other’s
wives, rifle collection-plates, betray innocent females,
tell untruths, laugh in church, insult pure-minded
barmaids, cheat the tram and railway commissioners,
drink, fracture the Sabbath, and in other respects
disclose the lowliness of their origin and habits. The
horrified Willie is now in a position to verify his
worst suspicions. Already he has been instrumental
in discovering that, during last Federal elections,
three people in every thousand voted irregularly—
though how many of the three acted deliberately and
how many were Laborites are questions that have
yet to be decided. He has also sheeted home the
damning fact that 40 acres of the best-grassed land
around Adelaide were let by a W.A. Laborite to the
Fisher Government ("together with a large house) at
an average rental of £lO per acre, for agistment
and other nurposes. Lord alone knows what Kelly
will unearth next. Meanwhile the rush of euiltv
Laborites to foreign parts remains temporarily in
abeyance.
SIXTEEN DEATHS IN TWO WEEKS.
“When a baby my little girl had diarrhea, and
as 16 children had died from it in this locality in
two weeks I was greatly alarmed,” says Mrs. Alice
Williams, Cressy (Tas.). “The doctor could do ab-
solutely nothing for her, but as. I am a great be-
liever in all Chamberlain’s Remedies I gave her
Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with mar-
vellous results, for she was soon quite well again.”*

On Saturday Maoril.ander Alfred Hill was
At Home at Sydney Town Hall. In the
atternoon the Symphony Orchestra pro-
duced his JVl&ori liha,psody M j in the even-
ing, at the Butt farewell concert, Kennerley
sa “S Ms vigorous and tuneful
YVaiata Poi Song.” Hill conducted his
own Khapsody; but the orchestra did not
seem to thoroughly warm to it. Yet there
is true music as well as vivid portraiture
.^ e big thing was Tchaikowsky’s
I athetique Symphony, last conducted
here by Bath, the young man of the Quin-
lan Operatics, who is remembered because
he carried the heavy composition through
W l ,°ut. a _ glance at the music. On the
whole it is noisy—which suited present-
conductor Bradley, who loves noise. The
“Pathetique” was a distinct success. The
vocal soloist was Miss Bertha Dickens,
whose little voice was much too small for
the hall and the occasion; and to make
matters worse, what there was of it was
poorly produced. The farewell Butt pro-
gramme was mixed and mostly popular. The
magnificent lady, who stood behind a second
palisade of flowers before the evening was
through, charmed most in the “Fairy
Pipers,” the big “Creation’s Hymn” and a
setting of the Breton air of an “Angelas.”
Kennerley Rurnford did the usual sound
work, and at the piano Walter Murdoch’s
added number, a Chopin “Nocturne,” was
easily his most attractive. As a finale the
Butt-Rumford pair duetted, of course, in the
banal “Keys of Heaven.” Apparently they
have the fixed idea that audiences like the
stupid little thing. It would be a mercy if
they would get rid of it.

At Sydney Palace, William Anderson’s
hired party of U.S. Americans, who com-
menced business as “The Grafters,” and
with the proceeds became “The Speculators,”
will cease to songandance to-morrow night.
On Saturday, Bert Bailey and co. wili
start in to tear the city from some of its sur-
plus cash with the aid of an Australian
drama called “The Native Born.” Nothing
is known locally about the piece except
that it was written by Albert Edmunds,
who received all the congratulations and a
generous helping of profits when “The
Squatter’s Daughter” and “The Man from
Outback” were produced. If “The Native
Born” is in the same class (as is claimed
for it) Albert Ed. should be about due to
hire a bank for his nersonal convenience.

There is a heavy shower of tears every
evening, at Sydney Royal, when Butterfly
Madge Titheradge collapses pathetically in
the witness-box, after Lewis Waller’s cross-
examination. The average fall each evening
is 251 points. The official forecast for the
night is as follows : —Situation cloudy and
squally, with much rain; high domestic
winds, rough seas, but gradually becoming
finer and drier towards midnight. Some
haze and fog, but no frost.

Moving pictures of wild animal life are
to boom in Sydney for a time, and West's
(the Olympia) is in early with a long film
entitled “Wamba, the Child of the Jungle ”
The production is in the form of a drama,
and as a novelty it can be recommended to
the utterly blase and the entirely surfeited.
Also it is good for the person burdened witli
a heavy dinner, to the individual who carries
too much of himself in front of him, and to
the elderly citizen who sleeps in his talk

The most interesting remark this paper
has to make about the National Amphi-
theatre this week is that manager Ben
Fuller nas decided to revive the amateur
trial nights. It’s a long time since “the
bird” shrieked in Sydney, and its joy at
being uncaged once more will be done proud
to-morrow ni£ht and every Friday there-
after.

The gap caused in the large, warm heart
of Sydney by the departure of Hugh Buckler
from the Little Theatre has been admirably
filled by “The Punchinellos,” a gang of
entertainers who really do entertain. These
clever people have made a sufficient reputa-
tion in other States. Dressed as pierrots.
and not, fortunately, as “Punchinellos.”
against an artistic arrangement of black
curtains, the company presented on Satur-
day evening a smooth, refined and humorous
programme of solos and concerted work, and
evinced the possession of much musical and
character talent. The lighting effects and
the concerted work were thoroughly artistic ;
and few of the many items could be nossiblv
deemed dull. In the four “punehinelloesses”
the company possesses a quartet of beautiful
voices and much vivacity and versatility.
A farce, burlesquing melodrama, might be
commended to certain professional comedians
who introduce a similar burlesque in a
Sydney musical comedy. Any professional
comedian’s burlesque of melodrama has now
become as conventional as melodrama. But
in the Punchinellos’ farce there was quaint
characterisation, and genuine, not stage,
humor. The Punchinellos are commended
to those who desire refinement, real music,
and humor without dullness.

The spring show of the newest feminine
modes at Sydney Criterion, under the fan-
tastic title of “The Dancing Mistress,” is
being well attended by fashion-lovers. The
dresses and hats are admirably shown, to
the accompaniment of pretty, innocuous
music; and the “mannequins” are talented
and good to look upon. The room in whicii
the costumes are shown has been trans-
formed to look, first, like the interior of a
girls’ finishing school—in which a number
of costumes for Misses are attractively ex-
hibited. Then it appears as a Swiss chalet,
in order to display an assortment of walking
dresses suitable for Kosciusko, in comparison
with which costumes the Bulgarian atroci-
ties are mild and anaemic. Finally, it is a
ball-room, where the latest semi-transparent
evening dress effects are admirably dis-
played. The chief shop-walker, Mr. Jack
Cannot, works hard; and the manageress,
Miss Grace Palotta, is a spring show in
herself.

Although Miss Nellie Fergusson, alius
Jess Walton, has had a fortnight to learn
the error of her ways, she has made no pro-
gress, and the management, after carefully
taking the box-office’s temperature, has given
her another week. After that she will
probably be given up as hopeless.
Till then the Adelphi Theatre, Sydney, will
be the business address of “Her Road to
Ruin.”

Sydney’s Crystal Palace found Dr. Maw-
son such a draw as a cinematograph actor
that his season was prolonged until the
middle of this week ; and as the expedition
is to share the proceeds, it should get a fair-
sized cheque. Besides this South Pole film,
another of local interest shown this week
was the Australian Steeplechase, run in
Melbourne on Saturday. To date the same
horse has won at each performance. He is
the most consistent animal at present on the
turf.
** * *
By the end of this week, the military
film, “Australia Calls,” and the Kinetophone
will be but pleasant memories. The big hole
left in the Sydnev Lyceum programme will
be filled by a picture of millionaire Paul J.
Rainey’s, big-game hunt in Central Africa,
which will take the whole evening to unwind.

Merian s dogs at Sydney Tivoli this week
provide something out of the ordinary in the
way of animal turns. There are 25 hounds,
who manage without any visible human
assistance; and though it would be more
acceptable with a few changes in the cast,
it is as good an animal act as the Tiv. has
had since Drunken Dan gave a fillip to these
four-legged performers. The only other new
item is provided by Frank Fox, an English
comedian who owns rather a good voice
The Primrose Four, the De Bruns, the Six

The Genee season at Adelaide Royal fol-
lowed a famous precedent, and began with
the second performance. The music was
left behind in Melbourne, and after
agonised afternoon, managers Hazlitt and
Myers had to chase the early-comers off the
gallery steps, and head off the booked-seat
people as they arrived. The season has
since been highly successful. Setting aside
the “butterfly” and “thistledown” ecstasies
of the dailies, Gen£e appears to this critic
to be a superb toe-dancer of the old Italian
school one had imagined obsolete, and which
is distinctly less graceful than modern skirt-
dancing. But it is her acting that is even
more striking. Her facial expression i s
remarkable, and she entirely dominates

“Coppelia,” a brief two-act comic opera that

Yolinin is delightful, whether as comedian,

younger and better-looking than rumor had
suggested. To an inquisitive interviewer
she gave her age as 32, and her years of
stage experience as 24.
The seals at Adelaide Tivoli continue its
most remarkable feature. Henri French
and the Quaint Q’s attend to the humorous
side of the programme; Irma Caron, Dia-
mond and Beatrice,, and Crosby to the
musical. At the King’s are Tom McGuire,
Sherrat and Lang with eccentric music, and
the somewhat travel-worn Mangean troupe
of gymnasts. West’s show a charming
Hicks-Terriss dancing film; the Empire
turns on an organ to accompany a senti-

struck a winner with an amazing Life of

with immense detail and as much reverence
as possible—much sacred music incidentally.
As to the amateurs, the clever Appendreenas

The Quinlan Co. has returned to Mel-
bourne for a two-months’ camnaign, and
the strenuous musical life begins at Her

thus far that 14 operas will be produced in
succession without a pause for first-nighters.
Quinlan has undertaken to accomplish this
tremendous feat, and season-ticket buyers

performance of Wagner’s “The Meister-

All the Melbourne theatres are chang-
ing the bill next Saturday. Meanwhile
“Queen of the Redskins” is doing the final
laps of a six nights’ sprint at the Princess’s
This lamentable drama was produced in the
same spot a year ago, but it is still without
a rival in its particular line of foolishness
The villain takes the heroine from her oehred
and feathered relatives, and plants her as his
lawful wife in the home of his Noo Yark
uncle, where he (the villain) is sharing a
guilty secret with his wicked aunt. He
pretends to sell his virtuous Wahneetah to
an oil-king, or other millionaire, and is also
bent on poisoning his mixed piccaninny. For-
tunately, Broncho Bill, the adopted son of
the Redskins, rescues the lady from her
husband’s uncle’s mansion, and carries her
back to the forest glades. The insane story
must have been borrowed from a picture
drama, and fitted with dialogue, which, by
the way, is not too bad. Mann’s scenery for
the redskin section of the entertainment is
even better than the talk, and a million
times too good for the plot. George Cross
again wears the weird broncho pants of Bill
the deliverer, whilst the other members of
the co. are mostly different from the people
who sinned and suffered aforetime. Another
Marlowian revival, for six nights only, is
due on Saturday next, and there will be yet
one more hasty attraction before Allen Doone
comes along.

The wet season has set in at West’s Mel-
bourne Palace. “East Lynne” has turned
un. seemingly more agonising than ever. In
this version, which is in five acts and 117
scenes, a nipper named Pippin perishes at
great length as Little Willie, and the other
characters are apparently taken by English
mummers who play their parts as to the
drammer born. The rest of the bill on Sat-
urday was made up of Path<§ Gazettes and a
comedy called “The Fortune,” which is the
adapted yarn of old Christopher Sly, bio-
graphed by kind permission of Mr. W. 'Shaks-
peare.

Dad and Dave and the rest of the Rudd
family are to pass from Melbourne King’s
to-night. Maggie Moore and co. come along
on Saturday for a short season. “Meg the

hand.

To-night (Thursday) also is the last of
“Within the Law” at Melbourne Royal. The
Wallingford co. returns on Saturday with
“The Fortune Hunter” for the first Mel-
bourne time, and as the comedy professes
to be four .acts of joyful instruction in how
to make a million dollars, the city antici-
pates the event with sordid interest. Now,
in “Within the Law,” the burglars are con-
tent to go burgling after a swag which is
alleged to be worth no more than half a
million dollars.

At Melbourne Bijou, where Carrie Moore
was lately quartered, the company from the

violin soloist the concerts are particu-
larly interesting. Their one fault is the
tariff of admission, beginning _ with half a
guinea and ending at five “bob.”

At Melbourne Opera House Flynn and

opera to ragtime without loss of prestige as
a popular warbler. The Kebbles continue
to get the loud hand from the multitude for
their song and dance act, and Lillie Langtry
is doing a new song with the full support of
a choir in the twelvepenny seats. Lucy
Gillet, Cummin and Seaham, and De Mario
and Lady are booked for other halls, and on
Saturday there will be -a fresh shower of
stars to fill their places.

Yet another Melbourne art show :
Melbourne harbors a versatile artist in Miss J.
Cumbrae Stewart, who has crowded 165 pictures in t°
the upper hall of the Athenseum. The young lady
works cleverly in pastel, water-color and oil, and
nearly every effort is a graceful achievement. Her
pastellised portraits are things to look at more than
once; and her oils are entitled to even more bouquets.
“The Billabong,” in this latter section, is a piece
of crowded trees and deftly-painted water that would
be a credit even to the late John Ford Paterson.
“Like Sunshine She Lingers” is a thing of sweetness
depicting a pale, pre-Raphaelitish female sniffing
rose as if performing a rite. The lady seems
affectedly “too-too” in style, but her pose is uncom-
monly pleasing. Among the other offerings the most
taking is a fire screen, the feature whereof is a pan
displaying three ladies in a sort of dreamy landscap
of black opal and gold. All that the artist dema
for this charming thing is 14 guineas for w
modesty she is hereby sentenced to six months
a commercial college.

Obituary notices of the late Erskine Scott have
omitted to give him credit for fighting the battle of
the Sunday picture showmen in Melbourne. Years
ago Scott was prosecuted for running pictures on
Sunday on the silver-coin-collection-at-the-door sys-
tem, and the unpaid fines and costs imposed upon
him amounted to hundreds or thousands of pounds
bv the time he eventually got the decisions over-
ruled. Also, he deserved well of his contemporaries
by his ingenious method of putting shame into the
hearts of them who gave not even a “tray”-bit to
the collection. Admission was free to such as re-
fused to fork out any silver coin at all, but they
were always passed into a particular section of the
hall set apart for “rotters.” One Sunday a sheet
was fixed over the free section, and during an inter-
val in the show a lantern slide appeared on the sheet
stating that “the people seated beneath this notice
have contributed nothing to the cost of the enter-
tainment,” or words to that effect. After which the
abashed deadheads were converted into financial mem-
bers of the society.

The principal tenor of the Quinlan Opera Co. this

John Coates. And he looked it. The new man, per-
haps, will look D’Oisly.
Told, in a new volume of musical reminiscences,
that Arditi, opera conductor in London and com-
poser of the song “II Bacio,” was once advised,
being near Stratford-on-Avon, that he ought cer-
tainly to visit the birthplace of Shakspeare. “I
not know him,” said he. “What, you don’t know
the man who wrote ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ ‘Otello,’
‘The Merry Wives of Windsor’? You know the
operas, anyway.” “Ah,” said Arditi, with all the
condescension of tune-spinner to word-spinner, “you
mean ze librettist.”
“J.F.H.” (from London) : We are threatened with
an avalanche of “religious” plays. This is a conse-
quence of the permission given by the Lord Cham-
berlain to Beerbohm Tree to produce “Joseph and

established rule and practice. Theatrical managers
are exceedingly gregarious; so the Lord Chamber-
lain has been "rushed with manuscripts. The Times
rejoices that “the ban upon the religious drama has
at last been lifted,” but sounds a note of caution:
“No doubt good use will be made of the liberty,
though managers will be wise to move warily at
first.”

Foe ’: Isn’t it wonderful how the impatient city
patiently endures the blind man’s barrel organ, and
refrains from kicking the blind man’s occasional
able-bodied A.D.O. or private secretary, who steers
him round the streets and collects the taxes, or
blackmail ? In Melbourne, years ago, there used to
be a blind man whose impatient and bustling
A.D.C. would hardly give him time to drop the
handle, after churning out a brief selection, before
hustling him along to the next stand. The pair
used to get along at a sort of scuttling trot, the
A.D.C. towing the sightless performer by the slack
of the sleeve. I often wondered why they travelled
with such velocity. Some days I was sure that
they considered their disgraceful uproar too valuable
to squander, and merely played sufficient to announce
their arrival. Other days I felt convinced that they
were ashamed of it, and just loathed to take the
money. Maybe they had a big round of victims or
patients, and so were compelled to hurry as if en-
gaged in some useful and urgent work. Whatever
their reason was, that A.D.C. was a devil to get
along. He looked capable and spry, and I once
heard a business man say he wished his employees
would travel at something like the same speed. Is
the job of managing guide to a light-footed blind
musician a profitable one? (Barrel-organising is a
humble form of Art, and I feel a certain delicacy in
introducing the subject. But I would point out to
any offended Poverty Pointer who yearns to kick
me out of the column that there was no monkey on
this organ. I am ready to agree with anyone that
the monkey is not Art. If anything, he is Litera-
ture. )

The record run (9hrs. lOmin.), made
by the Union Steam Ship Co.’s new turbine
steamer Wahine, between Lyttelton and
Wellington, 175 miles, on Sunday, August
10, illustrates the remarkable improvements
in coastal travelling in Maoriland within
comparatively few years. The “ferry” ser-
vice between Wellington and Lyttelton is
the main connecting link between the North
and South Island, and was inaugurated as
such in 1896, when the old Penguin, of 524
tons (which came to such a disastrous end
in Cook Strait a few years ago), was put
on to ply back and forward. The next big
step was the putting on of the then grey-
hound, Rotomahana, now the recipient of
frequent and hearty curses on the Mel-
bourne-Tasmania ferry. That was 16 years
ago, and it remained till 1907. The cross
ferry was the Mararoa, the tonnage of the
pair being 1117 and 2598 respectively.
Then, in 1907, entered the turbine Maori
(3399 tons), followed by the Wahine (4435
tons) this year. They are providing a short-
range service unsurpassed in the world.
A cable message mentioned last week
that G. Harry Hawker, an Australian, had
met the King and Queefi at the opening of
the Cowes regatta on a waterplane, and
performed various sensational manoeuvres.
Hawker has done extraordinarily well at
the flying game. Two years ago he was
squatter Ernie de Little’s chauffeur in the
western district of Victoria. At the time of
writing he is about the most capable flier in
the United Kingdom. He holds three British
height records, and last year he won the
Michelin Cup, and incidentally put up the
duration record for the United Kingdom.
Sydney Pickles is another Australian who
has made a name for himself at the same
risky job. Flying a Caudron monoplane—
generally esteemed to be the most perilous
of air-machines —he did the journey between
Hendon and Brooklands and back, the other
day, a matter of 42 miles, in 291 minutes.
Easily a record. Half a dozen other Aus-
tralians, in addition to the above, are fig-
urine prominently on the British flying
grounds, and Stephen Douglas, a second-year
medical student at Sydney University, has
just taken his “brevet” at Farman’s school
in France.
The absence of any fragment of a sense of
the ludicrous is apparently an indispensable
feature of the militant suffragette’s- make-
up. Consider the hymn which 40 of these
ladies recently chanted three times in St.
Paul’s Cathedral, London :
Save Emmeline Pankhurst,
Spare her, spare her,
Give her light, and set her free,
Save her, save her,
Hear us while we pray to Thee.
A mammoth lack of proportion is displayed
in the effort to make the bearer of such a
name as Pankhurst the heroine of a hymn.
There are certain names which should never
be what one might term lyricised. Sarah
Pony, for instance, Arethusa Grubb, Jane
Tubbs —and, particularly, Emmeline Pank-
hurst. Incidentally, the hymn itself is
awful, as most earnest endeavors are. It
isn’t even in the same street with that
(real or alleged) Mormon anthem of bygone
days:—
Let the chorus still be sung
Long live Brother Brigham Young,
And blessed be the Vale of Deseret-ret-ret;
Blessed be the Vale of Deseret.
Plainly, the Pankhurst cause ought to hire
a good bard. It would be worth its while
to offer a man like David McKee Wright
£lOOO a year, with a steady, five-years’ en-
gagement and a bank guarantee of the sol-
vency of the salary, on condition that he
turned out a brief Pankhurst hymn once a
week. Then the suffragettes wouldn’t be
afflicted with symptoms akin to the above,
as the patent medicine advertisment has it.
From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
Sydney Telegraph on Saturday published a picture
of the historic house known as The Rangers, at
Mosman. The place, which has Brierley’s painting
of “The Rattlesnake in a Storm” on one of the
walls, is on the market now, and there is a proposi-
tion to retain the premises as “The Northern Suburbs
Institute” for the public. The Telegraph says:
“Every room in this building, which is nearly a
century old, is teeming with historic interest. The
building was at one time the residence of a Governor,
and one room is pointed out as that in which the
young Princes slept when they visited Australia. In
the cellars are cells which date back to the convict
days.” As a matter of fact, the building was erected
in 1844, and by free labor. The builder
was Oswald Bloxsome, a squatter on the
Liverpool Ranges (the house, by the way, was orig-
inally known as The Ranges), and afterwards manager
of the Loan Co. and British Colonial Bank. The
Bloxsomes would not have any convict labor about
the place. No Governor of this State has ever lived
there, and if the “young Princes” (one now dead,
the other George V.) ever did visit the place, they
make no mention of the fact in their journals and
diaries. The alleged cells are merely wine cellars and
storerooms. Henry Stuart Russell, a Queensland pioneer,
pastoralist and explorer, purchased the house after
the Bloxsomes had done with it, and spent £lO,OOO
on it. Russell’s hand was so open that in 1866 he
left it; the moths had crept into his riches. Oswald
Brierley’s painting was done on the wall of Russell’s
dining-room.
From one who knew him :
S. F. (“Colonel”) Cody, who met the aviator’s
usual end last week, was originally a showman in
America. He ran a circus there, and when the weather
permitted he flew outside his tent a string of those
weird box kites which were invented by Hargreaves,
of Sydney. He was “discovered” by Colonel Capper,
R.E., commanding the British Balloon Corps. Capper
installed him at Laffan’s Plain to experiment with
man-lifting kites for the British army. He worked
there successfully for some years, though it was only
a year ago, after a hard-won victory in the courts,
that he succeeded in wresting from the War Office
the money he had been promised for his kite work.
While at Laffan’s Plain he evolved a cumbersome and
intricate biplane, and had the Wright Bros, not fore-
stalled him by their flights in America, he would
undoubtedly have been the first man to fly. This
machine was christened “the Cathedral,” and its
first attempts to fly, coupled with the old man’s child-
like optimism, called forth derisive comments from
the crowd, which was so soon to see its triumph
under his amazing guidance.
This machine he flew in the circuit of Britain in
July, 1911, when it finished fourth, being the only
biplane to complete the course. A year later, Cody
started, to the terror of all his friends, to build an
immense monoplane, to compete in the British War
Office trials. There was a general feeling of relief
when he hit a cow and smashed both the machine
and the animal to pieces. He proceeded then to
bring out his old “Cathedral,’.’ and, fitting it with an
enormous 120-h.p. engine, fairly bullocked through
all the tests, and won the first prize open to the
world, in competition with pilots one-half of his age.
It was his wonderful pluck more than the merits
of the machine which won this for him ; and the
ever-misguided War Office took over the ancient ruin,
which shortly after broke in the air and added
another unnecessary (Vagedy to the annals of the
British flying corps.
Cody’s methods of construction were peculiar, and
he was no mathematical designer. He would work
away at his bench and produce a strut or a stay, and
then tell one of his few assistants to “make another
like that for the other side.”
He was famous for flying close to the ground. I
remember seeing him arrive on the Hendon aero-
drome from Brooklands during the circuit of Britain,
just clearing the tree-tops, and I asked him if he
always ran it as close as that. “Yes,” he said, “I
feel safer low down. I reckon on Laffan’s Plain
there isn’t a tree-top left.”
He was a naturalised Englishman, but the title of
“Colonel” was never really accorded him till last
year, when George V. addressed him as “Colonel
Cody,” at Aldershot. Then everyone was willing to

He was a familiar sight in the Aero Club in

always about flying and his own dauntless self.

Oh, grievous is thq actor’s life,
A never ending wear and tear!
With gravest cares his hours are rife,
And long the burden he must bear.
, He acts each night upon the stage;
He acts all day upon the street.
His hat, his hair, his equipage,
His lobks of joy, surprise and rage—
All-these must be designed to heat
Our interest, and so accent
The merciless advertisement.
The painter only paints at times;
the sculptor sculps in some retreat ;
The poet wrestles with his rhymes
In peace and quiet. But we meet
The actor everywhere, poor chap,
And always acting like the deuce!
He does it in his sleep, mayhap.
That’s why I never pay a rap
To see him play. Where is the use?
Our task, indeed, our problem grim,
Is how to get away from him.

PENFOLD'S
WINES
The two oldest houses in George-street.
and the last bit of picturesque old Sydney
in the locality, near the G.P.0., have just
been demolished. They dated back to the
Macquarie era, and were at one time the
property of Mrs. Mary Reibey, who lived
near-by in Reibey cottage, which later on
made way for Sands’s printing office. On
the death of Mrs. Reibey in 1855 the pro-
perty fell into the hands of “Bill” Long,
and from him passed to his daughter, wife
of Chief Justice James Martin. At one
time —1834 —the whole of the frontage be-
tween Hunter and King streets, barring the
post office, was owned by six persons:
Edward Riley, of Raby ; Prosper De Mestre,
an American merchant, who was naturalised
by special Act of Council; S. T. MacDonald,
Samuel Terry, Mrs. Mary Reibey and W.
H. Moore —the last-named the Crown
Solicitor, who in that year cut up and sold
his portion, the King-street end.
“Croson”: The electoral reform business
has begun. The new men are showing their
mettle. Willy Kelly has got to work. Last
week my wife, who has resided with me in
our present abode, dwelling or habitation for
several years, and still so resides, received
a notice from the returning officer of our
Federal Electoral Division (name completely
undecipherable) stating that one Wm.
Smith, an electoral registrar (apparently of
parts unknown) objected to her further con-
tinuance on the rolls as she “had left the
district.” The homeless person, Smith,
mentioned firmly that my wife may, within
20 days, orally or in writing, answer the
above-mentioned Smith’s objection. If she
doesn’t —well, there. My wife would like
to answer the objection of the returning
officer, preferably in writing, but the only
address supplied is “his office in Prahran.”
I’rahran is a big place, and, as above-men-
tioned, the R.O.’s writing is almost incred-
ibly rotten. To search through a large direc-
tory for a name which looks like a blot of ink
that has been trodden on, is too big a
contract. So I suppose the wretched wife
is more or less Doomed. Heaven help us
all; for Horse Sense in public places never
will, seemingly.
The sort of news never cabled to this
country is the story of the judicial joke in
India which was told to the House of Com-
mons last month. , Three natives of Oude
were tried for murder, in connection with
an “agrarian outrage,” and were acquitted.
Five months later they were re-arrested
and re-tried, on appeal. This time no wit-
nesses were heard, and the prisoners were
not even present at their own trial. The
Judicial Commissioners simply considered
the record of the previous trial, and found
the three men guilty. Two were sentenced
to death, and the other to penal servi-
tude for life. The accused appealed to the
Lieutenant-Governor, who refused to do
anything to prevent the law from “taking
its course.” Then they made an appeal to
the Governor-General. but the Lieutenant-
Governor refrained from forwarding it,
on the ground that it could not have
reached Simla until the day previous to the
date fixed for the appellants’ execution,
whereas the regulations require that the
Government of India shall have at least 48
hours’ notice in these little matters. So
the two acquitted-and-condemned men were
duly executed, and the Lieutenant-Governor
(Sir John Hewett) was promoted to the
Grand Cross of the Star of India. Such
stories throw brilliant sidelights on the un-
rest of India’s colored millions. The House
of Commons rose to the occasion by re-
roarkinsr “Oh, oh” when the 48 hours regu-
lation was mentioned, and it seems that “the
question of amending the rules will be taken
into consideration.” Natives in future will
not be convicted behind their backs of a
crime of which they were nreviousiv ac-
quitted in front of their faces, nor will they
be hanged without the option of an appeal
to the G.-G.

“Inchiquin”: Premier Peake (S.A.) is
publishing through the Register a diary of
his trip to the country he found so bitterly
Cold. He complains, in the last instalment,
of the sleeping arrangements of the French
trains. The compartment he was in held
six passengers—four men and two women.
Attached were two sleeping apartments,
with three berths in each. A satisfactory
arrangement by which each person had a
berth was, he says, made; but, very un-
advisedly, he omits to state exactly how
things were arranged.
QUITE FAMILIAR.
"Give's a match, chum!"
The recent case of a young fellow who
blew out Ins brains in Invercargill (M.L.) is
right up against the theory that every girl
wants to grab the other girl’s heart’s-desire.
The young man was conversing with Lottie
and Irene, when the question arose as to
which maiden should possess him. Lottie
said she loved him, whereupon the young
man declared for Irene; but Irene firmly
declined to take him. In effect, she told him
that Lottie would do very nicely for a wife.
Then, in his perversity, the young man killed
himself after making a feeble pretence of
meaning to kill the unobtainable she.^
The City Bank of Sydney celebrates its
jubilee this year. Business was commenced
in November, 1863, in premises on the north-
east corner of King and George streets,
known as the Golden Fleece
Corner. An inn (bearing
that sign was there then.
The corner belonged to the
late William Toogood. His
widow married the Rev. C.
C. Kemp, of Newtown, who
induced the lady to have no-
thing to do with an hotel
business. The City Bank
coming along, it got posses-
sion and held the premises
for 10 years. Then it re-
moved to a haunt in Pitt-
street. Burned out there in
the great fire of 1890, it
occupied temporary prem-
ises for a while until the
present bulding was erected.
Of the first board of direc-
tors Fred H. Dangar, now
resident in London, is the
sole survivor. The first
manager, J ohn Thomas
Ford, is still a resident of
Sydney. The Union Bank,
by the way, commenced busi-
noss in Sydney on the same Golden Fleece
corner a quarter of a century earlier.
Adelaide University has started out to
encourage poets, there being a local scarcity
of the article. The encouragement is directly
traceable to Miss Bundey, the tuneful daugh-
ter of the late Judge, who has endowed a
£lO prize to be given every year in memory
of her parents. The competition is restricted
to the Australian-born, of not more than six
years’ standing in the Adelaide University.
Unfortunately, the University has adopted
the old-fashioned conditions of Oxford and
Cambridge on such matters. The subject
is to be set and the length of the alleged
poem prescribed; that is, so many lines have
to be ground out on a theme that is not
spontaneous. Further, the prize will not be
given more tnan once to the same person;
wherefore, after a few years, the prize poem
will no doubt be issued with this warning
note: “We have two or three better poets,
but they are barred.” Also, it may perhaps
be justly added: “This one could do much
better work if he wrote on his own subject.”
“Scalpel”: Much rubbish is being talked
about the efficacy of “vaccination” against
plague as well as against small-pox. Plague
is certainly treated by inoculation, but not
with vaccine-lymph. The agent used is a
sterilised culture of the plague bacillus, which
either confers complete immunity for about
six months, or greatly diminishes the sever-
ity of an attack occurring within that period.
The “protected” person, in fact, remains all
the time in a faintlv pestiferous condition.
Present writer knows, for he has had four
interviews with “Haffkine’s Prophylactic
Fluid,” as the stuff is called, and, though he
didn’t get the plague, he got the blue-devils
pretty badly every time.
IN TOPHET.
“Where arc we?”
"Well, judging by the look of it, we've evi-
dently struck a N.S.W. main road.”
“W’lang”: It seems as if another cher-
ished institution has gone—in Victoria, at
an y ra te. From time immemorial “selling a
T-’V- *• method of ••paying for
the h g h t after meetings held at the country
pub. When the Anti-Gaming Bill was be-
fore the Assembly, John Weary asked the
Attorney-ijeneral if “selling a horse” would
be barred under the Act, and was told that
it wouldn’t be. But now a P.M. in Weary’s
own electorate has declared the “eame” to be
illegal, and Mr. Publichouse has had to part
up for .allowing the number to be called,
Very soon will Dour Face win all
through, and then, perhaps, someone will be
found to kick him.
A DULL TRIP
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The trip of the P. and O. Company’s Macedonia,
which arrived to-day, was described as the dullest
on record. There were not as many as 100 passen-
gers on board at any time, and only 78 were landed
in Sydney. Not a' dance or a concert could be
arranged in the first-class. The inter-State traffic
hardly justified the vessel calling at the various
ports! Only 43 people were brought from the capi-
tals.- —Evening paper.
Each dreaming maid, with drooping lip,
Builds all her hopes upon the trip
She’s going to take some day with Ma,
With money earned by patient Pa,
Who does not seek from toil release.
He makes no moan,
If let alone
To toil and shed his hair in peace.
It is the dream of maids to go
Aboard the gleaming P. and 0.,
And travel cheek-by-jowl with those
Who look severely down the nose.
Tea-planters, rajahs, lords and earls
Infest the day-dreams of these girls,
And give them very “meaning” looks,
Exactly as they do in books.
For, after lonely years “Out There,”
It is the girl with wind-blown hair
Who gets the sunburnt man, you know,
Aboard the splendid P. and O.
He follows with adoring eyes,
And vainly of his passion tries
To speak. ’Tis useless quite! And she
Enjoys the poor chap’s agony.
He calls her “Little Girl.” His voice
Is “stifled” —but he has no choice,
For Strong Men always mumble so
Aboard the fiction P. and O.
He also “pales beneath his tan,”
And runs to fetch her book or fan,
Or see the time, or read the log.
She treats him like a poodle dog
That once a week is washed with soap,
And never gives him any hope.
For, be it understood, he feeds
On hope! That’s all the poor brute needs !
He watches her and fawns around
Like any humble, well-kicked hound,
And hardly dares to lift his eyes,
While in her chair she calmly lies,
Surrounded by a ducal herd
Who “hang upon her lightest word,”
And “vie”—that is the word! They “vie”
With one anoth&j .' With her eye
She maddens >...c, or breaks his heart,
And makes an-•'.her vow to start
For Africa, wl.< re lions spring
And suffer for this sort of thing.
It seems a shame to tell the truth
To ardent and expectant Youth ;
But England’s old nobility
Don't dwell exclusively at sea ;
And liners sometimes come to port
Without a duke of any sort.
Such worthless hulks ’tis vain to catch
In hopes that you will “make a match,”
Or queen it over heroes dark
Who act like dogs that wag and bark.
O Maiden with the pensive lip !
Expect not too much from the trip
You plan to take one day with Ma,
With lucre begged from toiling Pa.
On leaden feet some sea hours go,
Even aboard the P. and O. —
The galleys of Romance that steam
Across your Paris-hatted dream.

Under Fusion rule a military order has
been made that no non-commissioned officer
or man can be placed on the “marriage estab-
lishment” unless he informs his commanding
officer of his intention to commit matrimony,
and afterwards flourishes his marriage lines
in that gentleman’s face. This order is
calculated to bring about again the condi-
tion of affairs which existed some years
back, at the time the notorious Webb' case
was ventilated in the House of Reps, by R.
A. Crouch. It was then complained that
it was more or less the custom at Queens-
ciiff tor a soldier to have to parade his
blushing donah for inspection by the com-
manding officah, and in at least one instance
that gentleman withheld his benediction on
the ground that the lady was a nonentity
or a vegetarian or something. As the result
of the Webb scandal, a section was inserted
in the Defence Act which read that “all
married men in the Permanent Forces who
have served for three years shall be en-
titled to be placed on the Marriage Estab-
lishment.” The need for the new order is
not half so apparent as its liability to abuse.
The Watt Government of Victoria might
do worse than drop whatever business it has
in hand and set about constructing a really

it would do well to make its strongest mem-
ber Minister for Health. A while back the
existing Board notified all whom it might
concern that destructors were to be built and

“tips” abolished. Nobody took any notice,
but the other day complaints about Bruns-
wick’s odoriferous “dump” became so vocifer-
ous that investigations were made. It was
discovered that in one small street, whose
backyards abut on the clayhole where the
city’s refuse is tossed, no less than eight
cases of diphtheria and one of typhoid had
recently occurred. On being spoken to chid-
mgly on the matter, Brunswick’s Mayor
said that the tip was “not at all offensive,
und, even if it were, it was on privately-
owned ground.” What a man to be associ-
ated with the guardianship of the public’s
health!

“Sardonyx” : The cabalistic scrib-
ble of most medical men is re-
sponsible for many more dispensing
errors than ever come to the sur-
face. Everybody, of course, hears
of such a case as that cited by
“Carton” (B. 31/7/T3), but there
are numerous unexploited in-
stances of the • use of an
ingredient other than the one
prescribed. The chemist, in
fact, has often to depend upon his
knowledge of what the prescription-
item is likely or almost certain to
be, and, though of course a tea-
spoonful of opium-wine for a child
would at once pull up any com-
petent dispenser, less important
misreadings are far more fre-
quent than they would be if the
doctor—like the chemist himself—-
were obliged to write a decently
legible fist in the language he is
most accustomed to. The use of
Latin is a mere survival from the
time when people spoke of
the “art and mystery of medi-
cine”—a belated desire to preserve
some of the “mystery” that causes

esoterically still, “Perg. in us.

Maoriland Worker, which is a whale for
logic, of a kind, puts it this way:—
We [Social Democrat party] can never fuse with
either the Reform or the Liberal party.
A little further on it is explained that one
of the main planks in the Social Democrat
party’s platform is the repeal of the Com-
pulsory Military Defence Act. Thus, the
party is to be kept pure so that the nation
may be polluted.

There was not much money in bushrang-
ing, seemingly. Jack Dermody, who

himself in the hands of the local police last
week and was taken to the Benevolent
Asylum. From bushranging to the Benevo-

wandered about the country, coming gradu-
ally to the conclusion that bushranging as
an industry is played out.

“Rosna’s” note from Britain:—
King George and Young Solemnity, otherwise Ed-
ward of Wales, have gone down to the sea to put the
seal of their approval on the Australia, the first of
the Commonwealth’s Dreadnoughts. The British
Admiralty’s gift to the Commonwealth, Rear-Admiral
Patey, acted as showman-in-ehief, and the 50
per cent, good Australians in the crew were alarmed
to see him drop on his knees, while the monarch
amiably prepared to cut off his head with the cap-
tain’s sword. It turned out, however, that his
Majesty was merely giving him a knighthood to wear
on stormy days. Next day the Admiral invited Mr.,
Mrs. and the Misses Ausitralia-in-London to tea on
board, and 600 members of the family, in two special
trains, went to Portsmouth to have it. The usual
miles of red carpet, bunting, ices, strawberries,
cream and floriculture were spread around—while a
band played rag-time, having meanly forgotten to
learn the “Song of Australia.” Later, Shy Commis-
sioner Reid recited an original monologue, accom-
panied by bland inquiries from the jolly Australian
end of the crew regarding the health of a certain
dry dog, now deceased.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
Lddyson : The Hogans and the Dwyers
never did agree, and when, after many trials of
strength and mutual tribulations, the Dwyers won
the suit that took Hogan’s bit of “crick” and half
his land from him, Hogan sold out the remainder
and emigrated from Waddy with his small belong,
tngs. That evening Hannan called upon Tim Dwver
clicking a sympathetic tongue. “’Tis a great
shame,” said he. “Did ye hear it? That bla’guard
Hogan s bin puttin’ the big curse on yeh, Tim. He
shtood on th’ hill wid th’ gr-reat book befure him,
n wid two candles burnin’, V he shpoke th’ curse
on yeh, Tim Dwyer. ’Twas a big, black curse, ’n’
im never wantin’ to hear th’ likes iv it, so I’m
not, him crossin’ himself th’ while, ’n’ talkin’ th’
terrible wor-rds.” Tim Dwyer said nothing in
answer, but he was impressed. Phinn, too, had seen
the ceremony, and had heard Hogan recite his
magnificent curse. Two days later Tim Dwyer en-
tered the kitchen, grey-faced and tight-lipped, and
sank into the corner chair. “’Tis worrkin’,” said
he. “Th’ black curse is workin’ on me. Pitty’s
dead. ’ Pitty was the red cow. Shortly after that
Tims second son, Jimmy Dwyer, fell from a tree
and broke his arm. “’Tis the curse iv Dan Hogan,”
said Dwyer. And when the fire went through Tim’s
crop, and burnt his milking shed, he crossed him-
self and accepted the blow as inevitable. Sorrows
came down upon Tim Dwyer. His wife died. His
best plough-horse broke its neck against a tree.
The blight got at his spud crop. The rheumatism
took him across the back, and lamed him till he
bent his forehead to the ground. Then came the
widow Ryan with matrimonial symptoms. Tim
Dwyer had a fearful dread of the “red widdy
woman,” and seeing her coming across the stubble
would throw his hands to Heaven, and whisper
aloud, like a man stricken and helpless, “Th’ curse !
Th curse! It is th’ curse.” The time soon came
when Mrs. Ryan talked openly of “the day when
we’re t’ wed, Timmy dar-rlin’,” and Tim only
groaned in reply, and whispered: “’Tis th’ curse!”
Tim had been six months a widower when the red
widow said to him, “I’m thinkin’ Chewsdee fortnit
will be suitin’ me fer th’ weddin’, Tim Dwyer—-
Chewsdee fortnit at two iv th’ clock.” “Th*
curse!” whispered Tim within himself, and that
very day he put on his old funeral suit, and went
out on a pilgrimage. He was five days tracking
Dan Hogan. He came back, looking a new man,
erect, firm-lipped, the old fire in his grey eye. The
red widow ran to see what had happened him all
this time. “Was yeh off buyin’ fer th’ marryin’,
maybe, Tim darlin’ ?” she said. “Never a ha’p'orth,”
answered Dan, cold as the headstone of a saint.
“Well, well, ’tis all right, no matter fer what ye
vvint, Timmy; we marry the Chewsdee cornin’!”
“We do not, Bridget Ryan,” thundered Tim. “We
do not marry Chewsdee cornin', nor never a Chews-
dee. ’Tis all a mishtake, all a mishtake from th’
first. ’Twas a misapprehinsion killed me cow, ’n’
broke me b’y’s leg, ’n’ burrned me crop, ’n’ took
off me wife. ’Twas me brother Mike Dwyer Dan
Hogan cursed, ma’am, an’ ye can go ’n’ marry him!’’
“Souter Johnnie”: Re recent Bulletin
par. If the bomerang was used by the blacks in
the Cooktown district in “Wal’s” youth, then he
must have collected them all, with one exception,
and taken them with him when he left. At any
rate, the exception was the only one I saw among
the blacks during several years’ prospecting and
pilgrimage in the whole peninsula from Cape York
down to the West Normanby goldfield (90 miles
south of Cooktown as the crow flies sometimes and
the boomerang seldom). The Black Brother who
owned and mishandled it was a stranger from the
Mareeba district, and he couldn’t throw it worth
sixpence. In fact, I believe he stole it or bought
it by a process of swap for a gin or a jew’s harp
or something equally useless, an" ueglected to steal
or buy the art, knack or scien' of wielding it.
IN THE PROPER ORDER.
Captain Mary Booth, daughter of General Bram-
well Booth, was sleeping in the room next to that
in which the intruder was discovered. Learning
that he was driven to crime by hunger, she promptly
took him to the kitchen and set before him a good,
square meal. When the meal was finished 6he knelt
down and prayed with him, and insisted on the man
praying for himself. —Cable yarn.
“And now," said the burglar, “ I'm going to
lake up the collection."
“The Pauper” : One of Fisher’s Acts has
introduced a new euphemism to the language, as I
found the other day when, calling for an excuse for
Gwendoline’s frequent absences from school of late,
I was handed this: —
jumbo flat,
teacher 20 Jan. 6.13
iam 2 miles to scool. Gwendoline is oldest of
10. Wife is lonly, as we think we get bonus in 2
mths, so keep her home sometime. Pleas exuse.
Your truely, George Bilbali.
MONEY IN IT.
BILLY: “ What that notice all about , Missis?"
LADY : “ This house to let. Two pounds a week."
BILLY : “Two pound a week! My word , I put one up on my place , mine thinkit."
“Olla Podrida”: Re Momba station (B.
19/6/’I3). The future owner may have elegant
diversion if he likes. The present manager has been
known to come to Wilcannia and White Cliffs
(both cities about 40 miles from the station home-
stead) driving mules one day and horses the next,
and riding horses and mules the following week;
and he once defied convention by coming to a ball
astride a camel, with his dress duds in front of
him. Now he rattles through the townships in a
motor-car. On the station, reputedly the biggest
in N. S. Wales, one can see camels in waggons,
camels “packed,” and camels in buggies, while the
boundary riders ride camels, mules and horses, and
the buggy boy rides a billy-goat. Also the station
bookkeeper has been experimenting with an aero-
plane, and tried to “break in” an emu to a go-
cart. S’truth, and city people talk about the mono-
tony of life out back!
* * * *
“F6ng-shui” (from Shanghai) : The
methods of Chinese fire-fighting are worth watching.
Fire broke out last week within our walled city,
which contains in the space of a small-sized Sydney
suburb 500,000 persons. At once 499,000 of them
got busy with the loot. The remaining
thousand, in firemen’s helmets and with
the help of a single tub of water, pro-
ceeded to put the fire out. The tub was
kept full by the aid of coolies, who were
paid at the usual rate per picul of water.
The chief inspector 6at by the tub check-
ing the coolies by the usual system of
wooden tallies. Tallies having run out,
the coolies refused to deliver any more
water. Fire in the meantime had con-
sumed a whole crooked row of houses and
was passing on to deal with the famous
willow-pattern tea-house, when a foreign
brigade arrived on the scene and quenched
the blaze. Whether ten or a thousand people got
burned to death it would be quite impossible to
find out, as no note is taken in China of little
things like that.
* * * #
“Coola” : Bill and I reached the dance in
a state of suppressed unfriendliness, due to the fact
that Bill had let fall our beautiful bottle of ryebuck
on the hardest boulder along the track. I was
doing a perish about nine o’clock and wishing Bill a
happy new year or something, when he gave me
the office from the door to join him outside. “There’s
a plant somewhere,’’ he whispered. “I seen two
blokes do a flit behind a tree over there twice in the
larst half-hour, and when they came back I nicked
round and smelled them. And you can leave it to
me, it’s the right smell.” Bill was correct, but
after a few visits we differed as to the tree. How-
ever, I left it to Bill’s bushman-craft, and he was
certainly marvellous. About midnight we could
only crawl to the vegetable, but Bill found it.
While we were crawling, I saw a lot of shadowy sort
of blokes crawling likewise, and investigated. There
and then Bill's bush work went up the pole. There
was a bottle behind every tree I
“Souter Johnnie”: One Allen, Mayor of
E. Fremantle, recently went for a trip as far as
Darwin, and on his return gabbled a yarn that from
what he had seen he was strongly of opinion that
so far as the more tropical portion of the N.T. was
concerned, the White Australia policy was fore-
doomed to failure. If White Australia is foredoomed
in the N.T., then it is also foredoomed in North
Queensland and Northern Westralia, and if it is
foredoomed in all these places then the Mayor of
East Fremantle may as well send me his chain of
office to tie up my dog with. N. Queensland is
being soundly, if slowly, settled with white people,
who are doing very well, thank you, and I can honestly
say, after a residence of several years there and
several others in the N.T., that 1 prefer the climate of
the latter. In no part of the Territory is the climate
so really tropical as the Queensland coast north of
Capricorn, and that is just where the most pro-
gressive towns in that State are growing up, and
where the native-born are holding their own with
any in the Commonwealth, or out of it, for that
matter. From April to September inclusive, if the
Mayor of E. Fremantle can sleep out without a good
thick rug (at present I am using three!) and enjoy
it “in the more tropical portion of the Territory,”
then I’ll buy him a new hall.

Thinks we ain’t no class at all —fit subjects fer their

It wouldn’t do fer them ter mix with common

For we are wot th' orfficers call “scrapin’s of th’

Shovin’ up, shovin’ down,
Runnin’ round with ’ose,
Slingin’ ’ay from day ter day, with chaff in eyes an’

Up an’ down, down an’ up,

Droppin’ in th’ tucker-tin and bungin up yer eyes!
Up an’ down, down an’ up,
Strike me deaf an’ blind !
’Oo would be a cattleman if ’e was sound of mind ?
We don’t know much about the sea. We ’ear of

Sorter ’elpless, at the time w’en willy-willies play.
An’ w’en th’ sailors show us where th’ Such-an’-

Shovin’ up, shovin’ down,

Chasin’ wild bush cattle down th’ race aboard th’

“B.C. Manoora”: “Bulloak” draws the
long bow when he talks about 1200 natives having
gathered at McGrath’s Flat, at the mouth of the
Murray, for corroborees. I was living there over 50
years ago, and the greatest number assembled in
those early days would not be more than 200 or 300
—and even 200 or 300 make a grand corroboree. At
that time I was Sub-Protector of Aborigines, and
issued stores, etc., to Black Brother; so knew the
number of mouths he could muster to the last frac-
tion.
* * * *
“Eddyson” : IJomm, and Raill, and Miggs,
and Mulcahey, met and assembled in Anderson’s bar,
agreed unanimously to a policy of harassment for
Stanley. They had no very ardent objections to
Stanley, but he was new at the Band, and had
taken Raill’s job when Raill was fired for being
intermittently drunk and always disorderly. Be-
sides, Stanley was a man set against sociability and
drink, and given inordinately to the cultivation of
cabbages, a person who took a fatherly interest in
melons and regarded passing loads of manure with
a sort of poetic rapture. Homm, Raill, Miggs and
Mulcahey did not purpose using violence towards
Stanley. The idea was just to cover him with
public ridicule, and heap contumely on his head
when opportunity offered. Raill was first of the
adventurers to find an opening. There were no wit-
nesses, and no wholly unprejudiced person could
say how it happened, but it is certain that Raill
was presently found digging Stanley’s garden, and
it was obvious he was in no fit state for unwonted
exertion. His eyes were blackened, and there was
an ear like a cream-puff. Raill offered no explana-
tions, but he worked hard. There was never a more
disgusted man than Mulcahey. The spectacle con-
verted his contempt for Stanley into a vigorous
hostility. He seized the earliest subsequent oppor-
tunity of expressing himself. Mulcahey did not
start in Stanley’s garden till the day after, but
evidences of the fray were still strong upon him.
He wa| even more painfully burred and hit-up about
the head than Raill had been, but he dug hard.
Homm and Miggs hung about on the other side of
the fence, and questioned Mulcahey. They betrayed
6ome evidence of anxiety, but' Raill did not inter-
fere. He kept his distance, being satisfied in his
own mind. Mulcahey was silent under cross-examin-
ation for nearly an hour. Then his patience gave out;
he dug his spade into the soil. “Hell t’ yer souls!”
he sai<), “d’ yeh see that?” He pointed to an eye
like a pitch ball. “D’ yeh see thim teeth that’s
missin’ ?” He yanked his lip down. “D’ yeh mind
th’ shwellin’ t’ me ear? Well, Stanley agreed t’ let
me off th’ rest iv it, if I’d dig in his gar-r-den for
wan day, ’n’, blarst yeh, I’m diggin’ in his gar-r-
-den!” Homm and Miggs were quite satisfied. The
crusade of harassment went no further.
SHORT OF PETROL.
THE WNADERER : “Gad, it’s marvellous what
they can do with them machines. Fancy
goin’ backwards full speed, upside-down!”
“Eryander” : I have made special study of
the dingo, as being one of our few non-marsupials,
and can back-up “Pick” and “Tarago” (B. 17/7/’l3)
in labelling the beast harmless to man. Was sur-
prised once on a Gippsland track to find a big yellow
brute tailing me up about 50yds. back. He ske-
daddled when I stopped. I covered another mile or
so before I looked back again, and found that I had
now a respectful retinue of half a dozen warrigals.
They vanished into the scrub before I could throw
up my Winchester. Then I suddenly understood.
The' Irish terrier I had with me was a lady. I
camped by the track-side that night, and had nearly
dozed off when a furious outcry from Biddy aroused
me to the fact that sundry dim forms were perforat-
ing the gloom with whispered invitations to come
into the garden, Maud. I lay still until a more
daring bloke than the rest ventured up to within
about 6yds. of the fire. Then I fired three rapid
shots at him as he bolted. The third bullet got
him, and, though I remained awake till daylight,
I saw no more of the other gay Lotharios.
CAUTION.
DRUNK (with sudden generosity): “ 'Ere, ’ave another with me.”
BILL (htirriedly aside): Ere, drink up quick, Jim, afore ’e renegs.”
“Gouger” : My mate and I made our way
overland from China Camp (N.Q.) to the Mossman,
along a blackfellows’ track, over country not
crossed once in two years by a white man. On the
sea-washed mouth of the Daintree River, nine miles
from the nearest of the half-dozen scattered settlers,
we came to a well-built galvanised-iron
hut. Drawn up anyhow among the man-
groves was a 20ft. centreboard sailing
boat, without mast and hatches. We
pushed into the deserted hut, and were
surprised to see two good cane-hottomed
chairs and a wire mattress. Ye gods,
and in as wild a spot as possible on the
N.Q. coast! Our blackboy said a fisher-
man had lived there. Then we were awe-
struck by the sight of two broken tum-
blers, two good stoves, a school slate and
the remnants of an expensive breech-
loader, with reloading gear complete. We
demanded further information from our
black boy, and got it. The fisherman was
a Japanese, and had gone away. Fisher-
man? Most fishermen I know are con-
tent with a box for a chair and a bag for
a bunk, and then barely make tucker!
On looking some more, we found a num-
ber of fine paint-brushes, well used, with
some revolver and gun cartridges, and a
broken watch, with a -finely-chased case.
Outside the hut was a fishing-net, thrown
on the ground, and rotten. Even a black
boy knows a fishing-net costs a lot of
money, and the fisherman who leaves his
net to rot on the ground is unique—
especially the fisherman who fishes many
miles away from the nearest tiny port,
which, moreover, has its own kanakas in
the business. We suspected our fisher-
man was fishing for channels and reefs,
and marking the whereabouts of the
buoys and beacons that are dotted inside
the Barrier Reef. And when, among a
lot of knick-knacks never used by a fisher-
man, thrown together in an old box, we found a Lee-
Enfield military bullet, minus the shell, we sus-
pected harder than ever.
* * * *
“Ivory” : I upend myself to defend Binghi,
the tracker, from “McNorth’s” sarcastic remarks
(B. 19/6/’l3) that said Binghi is able to track a
man through long grass, scrub and (save us!) a
maize-patch just as any amount of white stockmen,
etc., would have no difficulty in doing. I have seen
some fine white trackers in my travels, and it took
a top-noteher to follow a trail through long, dry
grass. And as for scrub, well it sounds right enough
in theory to be focussing your optic on to the broken
twigs, but I should be long sorry to be lost in a
scrub and be dependent on any but a real top-notch
tracker to find me. Where “Me” and many others
fall in is in thinking, because every blaekfellow
they test is not a first-class tracker, that none of
them are. Tracking is a profession in the tribe, and
there are comparatively few experts at the game.
As for Binghi’s capabilities as a spear-thrower—
well, I’d as soon face a revolver up to 60 yards as
a well-nourished nigger behind a spear. As a final
spasm I may convey the information to “McN.” that
the best tracker, as a rule, is Mrs. Binghi. It is
she who trails the wily gohanna and other delica-
cies. Mr. B. supplies the assault and battery when
the time is ripe.
“Celia Loid” : I see some kind old lady is
worried about the fate of Fido and Floss, and
12cwt. of other dogs lately shipped from Sydney to
the Solomon Islands for trade with the natives.
Having trodden the paths of darkness with our
Black Brother in the dog trade, I’m passing the
lady the tip that she can put in her biggest worry
about these pups whenever she has time. Their
fate is a rotten one from the day they fly the Blue
Peter at Sydney. I have never yet pushed up
against a man, black, white or brindle, who could
give me any reason why a dog’s tooth should be
considered useful or ornamental; but as sure as
these dogs are traded to the nigs, they are out to
lose two teeth. Only two are reckoned of any
value. The operation of extracting the prizes is
most interesting to everyone but the tyke. After
the animal has been buried in the sand up to his
neck, with a good chunk of wood jammed well back
into his mouth, the two canine teeth are carefully
removed —hauled, bumped or dug out with any old
thing that won’t spoil them ; but I never saw them
worry as to how much dog they spoilt. After this
performance the teeth are carefully bored and
strung, and represent so much spot cash (about
2s. each). The dug-up dog is just a village cur,
and hasn’t much use for any teeth, as his diet con-
sists of vegetable refuse and a little rotten fish
occasionally. About six months of this and he is
bald from nose to tail, with a hide on him that
would make a fellmonger envious. Some are more
fortunate and escape—to the alligators. But these
are the exceptions.
ALL CLEAR!
HE: “Is the people of the house in?”
SHE: “ No, they're all out.”
H E: “ ’Ave yer paid yer dog license yet?”
S HE: “ We ain't got no dog.”
H E: “ Well, Eve come to look at the telerfone.”
“Paff” : Met him in a North Queensland
copper town, where he had been sent for “experi-
ence.” AVe were having tea on the hotel verandah
when he strolled in. The waitress offered him a cup
of tea, but he replied: “No, thanks, girl; I—haw
detest that —haw—beastly condensed milk.” She
then offered to get him some goat's milk, if he
would hold the goat. We watched the fun. After
considerable trouble they caught the .goat, which
was of the large AVilliam variety, and the Johnnie
held it by the horns whilst the girl went to get a pail.
After struggling with the embittered male for about
10 minutes, and there being still no sign of the girl
he called to us. “Have you seen —ah —that girl?
I can hardly—haw—hold the —haw—vicious animal,
and it —haw —emits such a—haw—disagreeable
odor.” I thought that the joke had gone far
enough, and told him to let William go. I also
explained other things. He confided to me after-
wards : “What a—haw—beastly juke to play on a
fellow ! And she seemed such a —i:aw—respectable
girl.”
From Brassey’s ‘‘Naval Annual” (1913)
The Mother Country can no longer bear the grow-
ing burden of protecting at sea the whole Empire
and its Ocean trade. Expenditure on Army and
Navy has more than doubled in 20 years. In con-
sequence of the concentration forced by Germany’s
challenge, the China battle squadron has disappeared ;
Japan is undisputed mistress of the Eastern Seas!
In the Mediterranean 10 years ago we maintained a
powerful fleet, which has ceased to exist. In the
West Indies, in the waters of South America, and
other regions where we have vast commercial in-
terests, the British flag is hardly ever shown.
And Australia, which lies in “the Eastern
Seas,” of which “Japan is undisputed mis-
tress,” continues to be tremendously inter-
ested in its penny postage stamp, and its
polo, and the eternal struggles of one small
politician to show the infamy of another
small politician and his utter unfitness in
some small way for small office; and it
dawdles over its transcontinental railway,
and raises Cain at every proposal to put on
an extra tuppence of National taxation;
and it sends its work to the foreigner so
that the foreigner may have fighting men;
and it bleats of Empiah and arms itself
with a new box of voice jubes so that it
may howl “Rule Britannia” louder than
ever. Also what scrap of work it pronoses
to attempt on the Port Darwin railway is to
begin at the north, so that when an enemy
takes Port Darwin he will have so much the
more railway to carry his troops
south, whereas if work began at the south
the Australian would have so much more
railway to carry his troops north. This
arrangement arises from the fact that if
work began from the south the Government
would have to commit itself to one of two
routes, and it can’t commit itself without
losing votes somewhere. And the uniform
railway gauge hasn’t arrived. And the
country says it can’t make its own locomo-
tives, but must send the job abroad. And
a great many Lahorites object to immigra-
tion lest we should have men here to defend
the country. And many people of all shades
of political opinion have “conscientious
scruples” about defending the country at
all. And incidentally Brassey’s “Naval
Annual.” which takes no special interest in
Australia and is a cold record of events,
remarks that “Japan is undisputed mistress
of the Eastern Seas.”
■*-
One of the first things that Victoria’s Wil-
liam Watt discovered when he arrived in
England, six months ago, was that the
marketing of Australian products in Lon-
don was on an entirely wrong basis. It
was borne in on him that the system needed
decentralising. To that end he has an-
nounced his intention of asking the States
“to unite in promoting one or two shipping
services from the Commonwealth, to Liver-
pool, Manchester, Bristol, Hull, etc.” Eng-
land is a very small country, with a large
number of railway systems. London is a
very big port, with a vast and splendid col-
lection of the most modern facilities for
distributing imports. Indeed, if this were
not so, a big proportion of the inhabitants
of the Freetrade-blighted land would be in
a bad way as regards the securing of the
bare necessaries of life. In short, the de-
centralisation of trade is not a crying need
in England. Victoria — Watt’s own State
-—presents the obverse side of the picture.
It is a much larger place than England. It
has but one railway system. And practi-
cally all the State’s exports and imports,
as well as most of the locally-produced
goods that are afterwards distributed
amongst the inhabitants, are deliberately
crowded, by that system, day in day
out, into the more or less out-of-date and
indifferently-eouipped Port of Melbourne.
If Watt really wants to advantage his
State, he will leave the Socialistic business
of promoting Australian shipping services
to Bristol and Hull alone, and, instead,
lavish his energy and any money that he has •
to spare, or that he can induce others to
spare, on the really urgent business of
opening up the starved ports along the Vic-
torian coast. That would do more good to
Victorian trade than a whole fleet of State
steamers trading out of Port Phillip to
the effectively decentralised regions of Eng-
land. But Watt, of course, knows this
already. The only thing that debars him
from doing the right thing in the matter is
the fact that his Administration, like so
many previous ones, practically relies for
its life on the vested interests of Mel-
bourne.

TO STOP FALLING HAIR.
Falling hair —the forerunner of baldness
—is nearly always due to the presence of a
parasite known as the dandruif germ. If
your hair falls out the chances are ten to
one that the dandruff germ is the cause of it,
and you cannot do better than to get your
chemist to make you up a bottle of the old
reliable formula, consisting of 3oz. of Bay
Rum, loz. Lavona de Composee and i dram
Menthol Crystals. Apply night and morn-
ing, rubbing briskly into the scalp with the
finger tips. This preparation, which enjoys
a world-wide reputation as a hair grower
and dandruff destroyer, is popularly known
as Lavona Hair Tonic, and many chemists
keep it prepared ready for sale. Lavona
Hair Tonic is claimed by many to restore
grey hair to its original color as well as
making the hair grow, and destroying the
dandruff germ.*


A “SPLENDID OFFER."
LONDON, W’ednesday Evening. —An anony-
mous sympathiser has offered to advance the
fares, where necessary, in connection with
the New South Wales widows scheme of im-
migration. The first contingent will sail
during October.
The New South Wales Immigration Department arranged to send out to the
State small batches of widows of the artisan class, with one child each; also tea-
shop waitresses, if they were prepared to accept domestic service.
It is now known thut this “anonymous
sympathiser" is no other than Mr. Tony
Weller, whose views ujK>n “Widders” are
notorious.

Flickered out, in Maoriland, George
Henry Swan, aged 80, for 15 years mayor
of Nanier and three years M.P. for the
same restful town. He was one of those
rare birds, a brewer with a soul above
dividends ; but there is no need to get ex-
cited and raise a monument to him. He
has several, chief amongst them being the
Marine Parade, at Napier, a boulevard pro-
bably unsurpassed for beauty on any part
of the Pacific coast-line.
Angus, M.P. in the S.A. Assembly: “It
was reported that Mr. had resigned
from the leadership of the Labor party
owing to ill health, but I am glad to see
that he looks quite as well as usual.” “Oh,”
said the sarcastic Peake, “he lets conceal-
ment like a worm i’ the bud prey on his
damaged cheek.” But, as a matter of fact,
Verran has really been unwell, though he
would probably have been displaced in any
case.
Naumai: P. C. Webb, who succeeds the
late Speaker Guinness as member for Grey
in the Maoriland Parliament, belongs to the
Federation of Labor crowd (identical with
the Industrial Workers of the World, who
have their home in the Yankee country).
They oppose compulsory military training,
and advocate a general strike in case of
war. Which means that they propose to
sit down and let the invader take every-
thing he can find. And that idea will suit
the invader down to the ground. He will
take everything. Incidentally he will per-
haps hang AVebb on suspicion, thinking
that a man who professes such impossible
ideas must have some great conspiracy or
device or ace up his sleeve.

Last week s cable news that the Earl of Rocksavage
had married Miss Sybil Sassoon in a registry o&ce
must have caused London Society more thrills than
a dozen murders The extraordinarily good-looking
hen to the Cholmondeley Marquisate has figured m
the hmelight, through no fault of his own, for the
years. He is one of the best polo-
p ‘ jers in the world in fact, he has represented
. n ,^f in t severa l times against the United States. lie
is likewise a champion at tennis and at a number of
other games and pastimes. On the other hand, he is
chronically broke. It is his misfortune that he is
the idol of the upper middle class London “knut”
a grim infliction. His manner of dressing, phrases,
habits, and so forth, are copied by his worshippers
with slavish fidelity. The Sassoons are outrageously
wealthy Indian Jews. If they haven’t a powerful
dash of the tar-brush in them, they are grossly
libelled by their complexions, eyes, etc. Most of
their money comes from textile mills in Calcutta,
The first Sassoon to burst on London Society per-
formed the feat in the latter part of Queen Vic-
toria’s reign. He took Dorchester House in Picca-
dilly, the immense mansion which had been let to
the Shah of Persia (who left it in such a state of
filth and decayed meat that a question arose whether
it wouldn’t be cheaper to burn it down than to
clean it), and which was inhabited latterly by an
American millionaire. Ed. VII., then Prince of
Wales, fraternised with the somewhat discolored plu-
tocrat, and socially he was a made man. According
to the cable, Miss Sassoon is to get an allowance
of £25,000 per annum, and a lump sum down of
£50,000. This would, of course, have no influence
whatever on Lord Rocksavage. Love regards, mere
lucre as so much superfluous dross.
A FOWL WHICH CAME HOME
TO ROOST.
Britain’s champion sleeping-man died the
other week of cold and exposure, due to a
fall into a river—-when napping, it is sup-
posed. The shock of the cold water woke
him up, but as soon as he had clambered out
he fell asleep again and died of his damp-
ness. Deceased, Arthur Mann, was the son
of a Derbyshire J.P., and a
much-travelled person. His
life appears to have been mainly
spent in looking for a country
where he wouldn’t fall into a
cataleptic sleep, but he never
found the right climate. He
had a way of collapsing sud-
denly and remaining practically
dead for weeks at a stretch.
Once, in America, he nearly got buried by
mistake. Seemingly he was quite dead when
he was buried, for the police had kept him
under surveillance until decomposition had
made considerable progress.
A parson named Brough, who has hung
out his clerical shingle in India for a num-
ber of years, lately told the people of West
Maitland (N.S.W.) that King George did
“a magnificent stroke of genius” when he
visited India, and that he is known there as
“the Sympathiser.” Well, sympathy is
cheap enough. There have been rulers
called “the Perfect,” “the Bad,” “the Mad,”
“the Devil,” “the Promiser,” “the Peace-
maker,” “the Pig-Dealer,” “the Unready,”
“the Thunderbolt.” the Sudden.” “the
Lame,” “the Well-Beloved.” “the Terrible,”
“the Fortunate,” “the Hammerer,” “the
Long-legged,” “the Drunkard,” “the Flute-
player” and all manner of such things. A
“Sympathiser” more or less doesn’t matter
among the crowd. Some day there may
even be a King nicknamed “the Hen-
Stealer.”
Chief Justice Way (S.A.) has been seri-
ously ill, and his friends were very anxious.
He was born just three months before the
first shipload of settlers arrived in the State,
and he has been Chief Justice for 37 years.
His father was a Bible Christian parson
who never received more than about £l5O a
year, and the son still remains a good Metho-
dist and till lately was always ready to pre-
side at a tea-meeting if so desired. Another
hobby is the breeding of long-woolled sheep,
and as there is more money in that, he now
owns a good deal of city property. Before
he went on the bench he was a law-partner
of ex-Senator ’Siah Symon.
Owing to the increased cost of living the
salary of the Clerk of the Vic. Legislative
Council (the successor to the immortal
Jenkins) has been raised from £9OO to
£H)()0 a year. The late Jenkins got more
than that, but he was an oleaginous iden-
tity with a capacious beard.

" A ' n a PP recia t loD by O.K. :
, A most respectable educational publication is the
Australasian Vacuum Review, prepared every
quarter by the technical department of the Vacuum
Oil 0 O j n Melbourne. If its first intention is to
make “every salesman and other employee” of the
co. wise t° the virtues of the goods they deal with,
and how t 0 h the trade its matte r is none the
i ess educational all round. And the review breathes
a spirit of fair dealing-, anyhow. C. A. Moser, man-
aging dire ctor of the Vac.,‘is about the most popular
and pat ernal boss in Melbourne. Himself a clean-cut
cosmopolitan Yank of the Hanoverian type, he runs
the show with a strong leaning towards Australian
business capacity in the staff. Moser, seemingly, is
the schoolmaster who impresses on the undermasters
and pupils the system of organisation and manage-
ment under which he was trained, and for which he
reckons that he can find just as good material in his
adopted country as in the place the co. radiates from,
His policy of encouraging local industry in brains
by checking the importation of heads of departments,
has endeared the amiable disciolinarian to the em-
ployees. “They all love Moser - .” Characteristic of
the man is his article on “Modern Salesmanship” in
the March issue of the Vacuum Review. His pre-
cepts are clean: “Very few businesses can endure on
the one-sale principle. Therefore no man or house
can afford to sell to a customer but once. In other
words, the basis of commerce is confidence—faith on
the part of the buyer in the salesman, in the firm he
represents, in the goods he sells. The satisfied buyer
is the best advertisement,” etc., etc. The immediate
cause of this commercial-minded Review is shown in
an extract from Printers’ Ink at the end of the
number: “Nine points of the battle is to have an
intelligent disciplined army of workers at your back,
The big concerns make a practice of keeping up the
post-graduate education of their salesmen by means of
literature and conventions, and more and more of the
lesser concerns are making use of booklets and ‘senti-
ment’ to the same end.”
F . R Suttor> p res ident of
the N.S.W. Leg. Council, should
know a thing or two about poli-
tics. He represented Bathurst
in the Leg. Ass. for many years,
having been elected 12 times.
Then he decided to try the Leg.
Council. After a spell there
he resigned (1891), and was
re-elected to the Assembly.
Changing his mind again, he
was re-appointed to the Council
in 1900, and has been President
practically ever since. His
father before him represented Bathurst and
Roxburgh Counties (in the Ist to the 6th
State Parliaments inclusive), his brother
represented East Macquarie in two Parlia-
ments, and his uncle, John Bligh Suttor,
represented East Macquarie in the sth and
6th Parliaments. And all four were at one
time or another in Leg. Council. Frank
Suttor, the last of them, was born in 1839,
but is still a sprightly chicken at 74.
Erstwhile Crown Prosecutor Gurner, who
has just completed a 12 months’ commission
as an acting Judge in Melbourne, made his
task pretty miserable owing to his peculiar
sense of fairness and toleration. The mere
fact that juries disagreed at the fate of two
or three a week, necessitating his Honor’s
presence at the court till 8, 9 or 10 o’clock
at night, did not ruffle him in the slightest.
Neither did he ever weary of the tall stories
that were told by prisoners and counsel—
which all goes to show what a considerate
old soul he is. But Judge Gurner’s methods
had their disadvantages; for instead of
clearing away doubts his Honah manufac-
tured them in large quantities, and the
always-present 12th juryman, filled with
either recalcitrancy or mere cussedness,
fastened on to them like a limpet. The
whole paraphernalia was repeatedly hung
up in consequence. It is a great rule in the
criminal courts: “Find out which of the
12 jurors is the twelfth juror, and kill
him.”
From a man who campaigned with him: —
If “Bill” Lyne had taken reasonable care of him-
self, he would have lived to be a hundred. But
even his rare physique and stamina couldn’t stand
the strain he put on them. When out campaigning
in the Hume he would arrive in town in the morn-
ing, knock about all day, put most of the steady
consumers of liquor under the table, address a
meeting for two or three hours at night, and then
(still fresh and full of “go”) drive off through the
bush for 30 or 40 miles to get an early start next
day—or take train to Sydney or Melbourne, if occa-
sion required it. As a “local representative” Bill
was for 30 years the champion. People in all sorts
of out-of-the-way places had come to realise that if
they wanted a post office or a policeman or a road
or a culvert or anv other old thing, the member
for the Hume was the man to get it. If you come
across a bit of good road in the wilds of the Upper
Murray and remark upon it, your host is sure to say:
“Yes, Lyne got us that.” In fact, if you take
away the things that Lyne got in most parts of the
great Hume electorate, and more especially near the
border, there is practically nothing left but the
indigenous wombats and the rest of the landscape.
In an election the big-bodied, kind-hearted “bullock-
ing” Australian got a most remarkably-diversified
support. Labor organisers worked enthusiastically
to secure his return: and rich squatters, to whom
Labor is anathema, lent him motor-cars and horses.
And how he did stick to his friends! It was quite
characteristic that once he held up a great public
work —a big hospital—because there was opnosition
to_ the appointment of a nurse whom Bill—then
Minister for Works—had recommended for a place
on the staff. The Board ignored the Minister’s
recommendation at about the time that the hospital
was being completed. Thereupon Bill promptly in-
timated that if Nurse was not appointed, he
would not take over the building, and there would
be no subsidy. Behind the scenes there was indig-
nation and uproar, but “the tumult and the shout-
ing” didn’t disturb Bill, and the nurse got her
billet. Incidentally she was about the best nurse the
district ever had, and she was not related to Bill
even in the 170th degree.
South Australia runs to substantial com-
fort all round rather than big fortunes in one
hand, and the Andrew Tennant estate, just
proved at £550,000. is the first to top the
half-million since the Angas probate of ten
years back. There are three sons and three
daughters to share it.
REAR-ADMIRAL
CRESS WELL,
of the Austra-
lian Navy.
“Jimmie Pannikin,” otherwise Donald
Fraser, recently achieved his 50th year; but
the accumulation of time seems to lie very
lightly on his shoulders. Neither is his eye
dim, nor his step devoid of the hefty spring
of youth. It was in 18S5 that his first con-
tribution blew into the editorial desk of Tub
Bulletin office. The Bulletin office has
been shifted since then, but the stream of
“Pannikin” contributions followed it, and
threatens to go on till long after the present
staff has died. In 1886 “J. Pannikin” went
forth to the Great Scrub; and most of his
time since has been spent in its treeless
glades.
Died at 77, the Rev. H. H. Britten, for
many years head of All Saints’ Anglican
College, Bathurst (N.S.W.). Some 30
years ago Britten was the central figure of
one of the most famous of the Ma State’s
court cases. While he was rector of St.
Anne’s, Hunter’s Hill, some of the church
property caught fire. An influential
parishioner—brother of a present-day Judge
—accused the parson of putting a match to
it, and he stood his trial on the charge.
Proceedings were made very warm ; but in
the end there was a triumphal acquittal and
general parish rejoicings.

So's our Religious Editor. Neither does he let
his right hand know what his left hand is

KNIGHTHOOD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sickened and spent, with swimming head brought
low,
The combat fearing;
Assured in your despair you shall not know
The victors’ cheering,
Were it not well to let lax effort go,
And, limply lying,
Take craven counsel of your soul, and so
Try dying?
Not yet! Fierce drums awaken in your breast,
And beat to call you
On to the charge, the shock, the battle-test
That must befall you.
Unhorsed and shaken, seize your sword anew,
Though spent and dying,
And then, with strangling heart and straining thew,
Die trying !

During the past half-year the strike of deck-hands,
etc., occurred, and that and the subsequent increase
of wages lead the directors to announce that “the
profits have not been sufficient to make adequate
provision for depreciation of steamers.” But, to
put it quite plainly, nobody with any knowledge of
accounts takes this co.’s statements seriously ; and if
the public says “Bluff!” to this last remark, the
directors have only themselves to thank for it.
And, anyhow, they have been too greedy to get any
sympathy. Since Dec., 1905, the capital actually
got from shareholders has been £134,986. During
the same period the co.’s landed property has in-
creased from £88,408 to £131,091; cash balances,
less liabilities, have increased from £18,700 to
£35,310; and about £15,000 has been put into
wharves, waiting rooms, etc. These three items re-
present £74,293 of the new capital, leaving only
£60,693 of the capital to represent new ferries.
lor that money the co. has acquired nine new steam-
ers besides horse-punts, and has made large pay-
ments on account of three other vessels. The outlay
on this lot has been approximately £180,000; and,
as shown above, only £60,000 of that has been pro-
vided by shareholders. The balance has come out of
the pockets of customers, who, of course, have also
provided the dividends, which have been equal to
about 14 p.c. on the actually paid capital. There is
another wav of putting it. The present paid capital
is £324,986, of which amount the shareholders in
the present co. have actually paid £214,986, in-
cluding the capital ( £60,000) in the original co.
The present net assets, apart from ferries altogether,
amount to £194,444. In other words, the co. has
assets apart from ferries representing all but
£20,542 of the capital which shareholders have put
Ho the business. This means that the public, be-
siaes providing the dividends, has paid for the whole
of the ferries except as to the sum of £20,542.
.hat is the history of the past 15 years. This
paper will do no guessing as to the history of
the next 15 years. So far the co. has
seemed to actually thrive on threats and fore-
bodings. When the Labor party came into power it
looked as though something might really happen.
But nothing has happened; nothing happened even
when the co.’s mismanagement led to the hanging
up of all harbor services for nearly a week, and
when even the daily papers were driven to curse the
co. It is no use prophesying about a co. which is
so plainly under the Devil’s protection.

If George Swinburne, one of the new Interstate
Commissioners, can make as big a success of Aus-
tralia as he has of this co., of which he has been
chairman for very many years, this paper will shout
him a halo when he dies. Unfortunately Australia
didn’t get quite the same start as this co. got. The
co. was given 28 years in which to make practically
as much money as it could squeeze out of Broken
Hill. Certainly, a limit of a sort was set on the
price to be charged for water ; but as the price of
water for most purposes has been kept at ss. per
1000 gallons, and as it costs no more to let water
run into a reservoir at Broken Hill than anywhere
else, the co. has been on a splendid wicket. No
doubt there were risks at the start; nobody knew
then that Broken Hill was going to be that miracle,
a mining field enjoying greater prosperity 25 years
after its birth than at the beginning, and showing
more ore reserves on its 25th birthday than on its
fifth, or 10th or 20th. And least of all, nobody sus-
pected that the smelters, which used very little water,
would be superseded on the field by mills, which use
a very great deal. So the co. has had a life gaudy
beyond all expectation. But the end is drawing near ;
of its 28 years only five are left, and when they run
out it will have to hand the works over to the Gov-
ernment and get nothing in return except a cordial
invitation to go and wind itself up. At its birth,
or, rather, shortly after its birth, it had a capital of
£200,000. Subsequently, as the table shows, it de-
cided that, as its interest in its principal asset was
fast closing in, it ought to pay out some of the sink-
ing fund which it had accumulated. It therefore re-
turned £150.000 (15s. per share). But, though
there was only £50,000 capital left, the reservoir,
etc., continued just as fine money-making appliances
as ever, wherefore in the past half-vear (a very
droughty one in the Far West) a profit of no less
than £42,393 was made. It is impossible to say
exactly what the co. will be required to hand over
to the Government free of charge, but, roughly, at
present it has £95,000 net, mostly in cash, which
will not pass to the State —except, as to some little
of it, on a valuation. That is 9s. 6d. per share.
Then it has five years to go ; and what it can do in
five years can only be guessed at from the fact that
in the past five years it has made £265,000, or
265. 6d. per share. Certainly it may not do so well
during the next five years. The chances are it will
not. Broken Hill may hot boom quite so vigorously ;
also the Government has another reservoir under con-
struction, and, though work on it is now dawdling,
water may possibly be running through the mains in
two years from now. Still, that is not going to
knock this co. out ; it will still have the bulk of
the mines’ custom, which is worth about 10 times
as much as the town supply.

This co., which formerly issued reports everj' half-
year, has dropped the practice—a bad one with a
concern which reaps its principal harvest only once
a year—and now sensibly makes up its accounts
only once in 12 months. In the table the evidence
of the previous bad habit has been wiped out, and
all is forgiven. But things are not as good as they
should be. The prospectus on which the co. was
floated set out that profits for five years had aver-
aged £20,774 p.a. ; and as the public put £lOO,OOO
more into the business, the profits, instead of shrink-
ing, ought to have grown. It is certainly up to
somebody to explain why a business which in the
old hands showed a profit of £20,774 a year on a
capital of £105,755 can now do no better than
£17,834 on a capital of £205,755, and, moreover,
instead of improving, does a little worse every year
than it did in the year before. Still, though the co
does worse, The Bulletin is by no means prepared
to say that it does badly. The profits for the past
year, the worst of the three, were equal to 84 p.c.
on the capital; and though 84 p.c. isn’t anything
tremendous at a time when you can get 7 p.c. on
good, solid bank-stock investments and over 8 p.c.
on many good-looking industrials, yet it is only fair
to remember that .just upon half the capital of this
concern is in freehold land and stores ; and one can’t
reasonably expect a big return with that kind of
security. Further, a great proportion of the £55,000
which has been put into freehold during the past
two years has gone to Brisbane, where the co. has
but lately established itself; and no doubt the
accommodation there is a long way ahead of the
business so far. For the present, therefore, The
Bulletin wouldn’t expect the new capital to produce
much of a return. At the same time, it certainly
should not be costing money, for it isn’t as though
the new premises carried a heavy mortgage. The
co.’s total liabilities are £83,766, and apparently
this, or most of it, is represented by advances against
wool and produce and on stock mortgages, etc. This
miscellaneous heap has now grown to £147,739. If
the co. makes losses in the future it will be through
these advances. Pretty well every stock and station
produce firm sets out with the best intention in the
world to stand out of this business ; but keen com-
petition for selling commissions drags them in, just
as it dragged the Melbourne breweries into tied pubs ;
and when drought happens along it is hard work to
get out. For this reason it is satisfactory to see
that the co. began with a comparatively modest 6
p.c. div., and that figure still allows of a substantial
lay-by. As the amount accumulated hasn’t yet any-
thing like replaced the goodwill or paper assets in
the business, and as the risks are apparently steadily
increasing, a lot more laying-by should be done before
the dividend is shifted up at all.

This co. started in 1909 with a capital of £BO,OOO,
of which no less than £46,235 was represented by
goodwill and other inedible and intangible assets:
and The Bulletin didn’t like it. Fortunately the
co. fell right into a boom, and it was just the sort
of co. to make money out of such conditions. Wages
were being put up, and, instead of taking a bit of
lunch to town, Willy shouldered into Sargents with
the best of them. And Bill's missus also, being un-
able to get “help,” told Bill that he had better have
something in town, because he wouldn’t be able to
get anything except bread-and-jam at home. So be-
tween one thing and another Sargents have been
making a lot of money ; and though the co. has paid
a steady 10 p.c., surplus profits have piled up and
considerably more than half of the old paper deficit
has been thus wiped out. Of the present capital of
£lOO,OOO, all that is not represented by tangible,-
assets is now £17,169. In other words, whereas at
the outset only Bs. 6d. in the £ was represented bv
anything that you could smash or sit on or drink
out of or fall over in the dark, now there is 16s. 6d.
in that category. Whether the tangible assets are
really worth 16s. 6d. in the £ The Bulletin cer-
tainly doesn’t know. The balance-sheet says they
are; but it depends to a great extent on the stock-
taking. For instance, furniture, fittings and plant
are valued at £38,195 ; and there is no way in the
world of checking that except by going round and
counting the cups and finding out whether enough
has been written off them out of profit to counter-
balance the extra loss in value through having five
chips taken out of them where last year there were
only two chips. Profits in a business of this sort
may be rather easily over-estimated by neglecting
to write off enough for depreciation. However, trade
undoubtedly keeps good; and though it won’t con-
tinue so good when the aforementioned Bill is more
often out of work than he is at present, yet the co.,
having less of its capital represented by unproduc-
tive goodwill assets, will be in a far better position
than it was when it started. A co. of this sort, de-
pendent so largely on management and the caprice
of the public, never can offer a gilt-edged security;
but it can make very fine profits while things go
well with it.

This co., after piling up profits gloriously for
some years, has lately been launching out vigor-
ously, and has been and still is spending a heap of
money on new carbonising plant, gas-holder, vertical
retorts, and extensions of. mains. The cost has
been provided partly by a new issue of shares,
partly by the issue of a few more debentures. As
to the new share capital, the table shows that, as
usual with gas cos., some of it fell into shareholders’
pockets in the shape of a bonus. For many years
the total paid capital had been £52,500; it now
stands at £88,286. (There are 120,000 ordinary
shares of 10s. fully paid, 72,883 pref. shares of
10s. paid with a few exceptions to 75., and 7117
pref. shares of 10s. fully paid.) Liabilities, includ-
ing debentures, amount to £21,200; liquid assets,
including stock, are set down at £19,040. On
account of the construction works in progress, the
figures are undergoing large changes; and no doubt
there are still more changes ahead. It may be that,
on this account, the future cannot be fairly judged
by the past; still, things have been so remarkably
good with the co. that ■it does not seem possible
that the introduction of more modern plant will
drive shareholders to the poorhouse. It is much
more likely that trouble will come by way of Par-
liament. Queensland gas cos., like those of N. S.
Wales, have hitherto been under practically no legis-
lative restraint, and if they keep going that way
they will have far more luck than those of England,
to which Right-thinking Persons mostly look for
their precedents.

That last line doesn’t look any too well; the dis-
closed profit was only £951 in excess of the 8
p.c. dividend; and if there was only that much of
a margin last year, what are things likely to be in
the future? For, though the construction boom
has eased off, many large works which had been
commenced are being completed, and, on the whole,
there has been far more activity than there will
be under normal conditions. In fact, in many direc-
tions Sydney has built considerably beyond its normal
requirements, so there is going to be less than a
normal demand for some builders’ requisites. But
there is this point to consider: how well such mer-
chants have done during the past few years their
accounts are hardly likely to suggest; if they are
wise (and most of them have been long enough in
the business to know how erratic it is) they have
seized the shining hour to write down various items
so hard that they won’t require much attention in
the dull times. And this co. has done something
more than that: it has unloaded a lot of its freehold
property during the boom. Follow these compari-
sons :

Thus through the sale of properties and the sale or
writing-down of machinery, plant and stock out of
undisclosed profit, liabilities in the past seven years
have been reduced by £73,321, while no less than
£49,470 has been added to the cash and book debts.
The position has therefore, to all appearances, been
very much improved indeed. What proportion of the
£81,647 of “cash and book debts” is
cash, The Bulletin doesn’t know; but if,
as it suspects, the book debts have been conserva-
tively valued, then the liquid assets represent just on
one-half of the paid capital, and properties (which
were written-down severely some years ago) stand
for a half of the balance. There are very few trad-
ing and manufacturing cos. with assets like that;
and the accounts, taking them as a whole, give the
impression that if the directors had wanted to do
it they could have made the year’s profit show up
much better than it does. The capital is £165,000
in 15s. shares.

That is a bit more like what was expected. The
concern, which was making money, but was terribly
handicapped by want of capital, fell into some of
the strongest hands in Sydney. This was about three
years ago. Of course, they drove a good bargain.
For goodwill they paid nothing whatever. On the
contrary, the vendors had to pay brokerage on the
shares which Adam Forsyth (8.,P. and Co., Ltd.)
and his friends parcelled out among themselves, and
this commission had to be handed over to the co.
and put to reserves ; and the reserves already in the
business had to be left there. There was certainly
not more than one other co. formed or reformed
during the Sydney industrial boom on such favor-
able terms for the new shareholders. Results for the
first couple of years were, nevertheless, poor. In the
first 12 months the new capital couldn’t be employed to
advantage, and in the second the old factory was
congested while the new one was being built, and
much of the new capital was still earning nothing.
During the past year the co. seems to have got into
something like the stride it hopes to maintain ; and
the div. is consequently sprung suddenly to
10 p.c. But it isn’t like Adam Forsyth to pay a
10 p.c. div. unless there is very good evidence that
the business is capable, as a general thing,
of providing more than £1072 in excess of the
amount required to pay that dividend. Adam
Forsyth generally wants to see a better margin
than that. The present share capital is £75,000,
and there are still £25,000 of 5 p.c. debentures
outstanding. In addition there are current liabili-
ties totalling £24,569. The assets to represent this
£124,569 include £72,130 of stock (“valued at
cost or under and fully insured”), £47.691
of book debts, and £20,106 of freehold and plant.
Of course, nearly everything—profit included —-de-
pends on the valuation of the stock ; but, assuming
that that is right, the practicallv-new co. makes a
capital start on what is apparently a very profit-
able business, and, instead of paying for goodwill,
actually got a bonus for coming into it.
Quirk’s Lighting and Engineering,
Ltd. (SvdneyV— This co. was formed to take over
the Australian business of Quirk and Co., manufac-
turers of petrol or air-gas machines. The profits had
been large compared with the capital; but as the
latter was only £9500 even for the last year of the
private firm’s existence, and as 25,200 shares were
offered to the public while the vendor’s little lot was
24,800, it looked as though the co. was taking con-
siderable risks. Plenty of things can show a good
profit on £9500 which can’t carry £50,000. How-
ever, if the vendor demanded a large price, he was
prepared to make the bulk of it more or less contin-
gent on the success of the business. He asked no
less than £35,328 for goodwill and patent rights;
but payment was to be made as follows:—By 14,300
shares issued at once; by cash, £1028; by £2OOO
payable within five years, after the profits have been
“such as will enable the directors to pay a 10 p.c.
div.” : by 10.500 when the co. is “in a position to
pay 10 p.c. and a sum equal to 7i p.c. on the esti-
mated value of goodwill shall be provided in
duction of goodwill” ; and by 7500 out of the future
issue of reserved shares. In addition to this n av
ment for goodwill, the vendor has received £547"
for tangible assets. Apparently if the co. pays on N
one div. of 10 p.c. and has 7* p.c. of the book-value
of the goodwill left over, the vendor will be at once
entitled to the 10,500 shares mentioned above Also
if, getting short of cash, it issues its 25 000 re’
served shares, 7500 of them must be handed to the
vendor. In other words, another £7500 (in shares')
must then be paid for goodwill, though the issue of
more capital may be due not to the growing value
of the business but to its failure to pull throueh
without further capital. The vendor’s intentions
may have been good ; but, altogether, the form of
the prospectus was loose, and the plan of payment
adopted is open to serious objection. The position
at present is that the co. has a paid caDital nf
£26.900 (14,300 vendor’s shares fully paid and
25,200 shares paid to 10s.) ; and it owes £6878
On the other side it has plant, book debts and cash
amounting to £22,666. For their 10s. per share
the contributing shareholders have thus at present
6s. Id. in net tangible assets. So far the co
has done well. For the past year, after making
liberal allowances for depreciation, it shows a profit
of £4417, out of which it pays an 8 p.c. div -
£2152. But as soon as it does a little better and
pays 10 p.c it will have to pay out £2OOO in cash
and thereafter carry also another 10,500 of vendors’
shares; and if it grows a bit larger and issues
17,500 more shares it will have to hand the vendor
still another 7500 free shares. A business ought to
have excellent prospects to be worth all this. For-
tunately, there is a lot of energy behind it, and the
finances seem to be very carefully handled; but
the business has to a great extent to make itself
and when a business makes itself it seems hardly a
fair thing that it should pay away so much to other
people who only started to make it.

A dividend in two consecutive years—this is Afflu-
ence indeed! True, half the capital was written off
a few years ago, so the 24 p.c. is really only lj p.c.;
still, when a man has got into the habit of getting
nothing at all, even 1J p.c. is liable to be upsetting.
Unfortunately, though a div. is paid two years run-
ning, the profit shown for the past year is less than
it was in any year of the previous three. It is a dis-
mal business. Queensland grows just about the best
wool in the world, and there isn’t anything in good
tweeds except wool; yet in the last year for which
figures are available Queensland imported £176,000
of foreign-made woollens, and £6500 of foreign-
made flannels, and £35,000 of piece-goods “combed
or fluffed on one side to resemble flannel,” besides
£lO,OOO of miscellaneous rugs and such-like. And
probably nine out of 10 of Queensland’s Laborites who
wouldn’t handle a bunch of bananas at a wharf if it
had been handled somewhere else by a non-unionist
declared their union principles to that effect in pants
made by sweated foreign non-unionists; and though
the local Laborite insists on the Australian manufac-
turer paying fair wages for decent hours, he doesn’t
insist on the shutting-out of the foreigner's goods,
though he knows that the foreigner doesn’t pay fair
wages or work decent hours. Worse still, he buvs the
foreigner’s sweated goods, and thus does the little bit
he personally can do towards shutting up the local fac-
tory and starving the local factory-hand. And the fool-
capitalist votes for Joe Cook and then wonders why
he gets only 24 p.c. on half his capital, and nothing
at all on the other half. In the case of this co. the
capital left in the business ( £23,339) is inadequate,
and the shareholders have to lean up against the
bank for an overdraft of £17,479 ; but what can it
do ? There is no hope, in present circumstances, of
getting more capital. So the concern has to follow
a cheese-paring policy, and carrv insufficient stocks
and generally give an impression that it is in a
ricketty condition. And this means that it isn’t at-
tractive to labor of the best sort, for labor of the
best sort won’t go into a line of business which looks
liable to snuff out. The new Interstate Commission’s
•l°b (s to look at these matters from a purely com-
mercial point of view.. Obviouslv the present Pro-
tection isn t enough to attract either the necessary
caDital or the necessary labor to the business, or to
save even the capital that has been put in the busi-
ness; and the sooner it tells Parliament how much Pro-
tection is-necessary ther sooner the present species of re-
fined cruelty will end. Meantime the Laborite who de-
mands preference to unionists and buys pants in
which most likely not one unionist had a hand had
better consider what sort of a colossal humbug he is.

When the co. started the public held 17,000 7 p.c.
cumulative pref. shares and the people who had
been in the old proprietary co. took 5000 ordinaries
all £1 each. After the ordinaries had got 10
p.c., the prefs. were entitled to come in for a
further helping of profit, if there was any left. In
1911 it was arranged to make all shares of the same
denomination, and at the same time another 8000
were issued at a premium which brought in £BOO net.
Thus the capital is now £30,000. Being well-handled by
men who know how to watch costs, and being, more-
over, blessed with a fair tariff, the co. has been able
to show good results on this moderate capital; and
the jobghas been made all the easier by the fact that
the capital was all real. There wasn’t any goodwill
loading for tbe business to carry. The labor supply
seems to be the worst worry, the felt-hatters having
made a pretty close corporation of their craft, and
shut down too hard on apprentices, with the result
that there are not enough tradesmen coming along to
keep pace with the growth, or possible growth, of
the trade. However, as said before, the business is
bandied by men who know what figures mean, and
don’t attempt the impossible. The verv clean little
balance-sheet shows no liabilities beyond £1384 on
current trade accounts; on the other side, land,
buildings and Diant stand at £11.870, stock-in-trade
at £18,840, and book debts and cash at £7793.
Depreciation appears to be amply provided for,
which is another way of saying that profits are no
doubt really what they are said to be.

Manly Electric Supply Co. (N.S.W.)
was formed in Sydney in April, 1911, to take over
the business of the Manly Electric Light and Power
Works, Ltd. The prospectus did not disclose what
the profits (if any) of the vendor co. had been ; the
frequently-misleading practice was adopted of put-
ting forward estimates purporting to show what a
fine thing could be made if more money was spent on
plant. But, though profound silence was kept re-
garding the past profits (if any), the goodwill was
valued at £2488. With plant added, the cost to the
new co. was £10,500, payable £6500 in cash and
£4OOO in shares —-which didn't hint any too loudly
at the vendors’ faith in the thing they were selling.
The public was offered 11,500 shares, but only 8120
were taken, and £B3O is still unpaid on these.

Evidently remorse or something of the sort impelled
the vendors, having taken very nearly the whole
ot the money subscribed by the public, to forego the
first year’s dividend. Of course no dividend at all
should have been paid. As a matter of fact, on such
skimpy applications no co. should have been formed.
As it was, the first year ended with an overdraft
of £2457. During the past year an attempt was
made to raise the wind by a debenture issue; £2400
was thus got in, and there are other debts (including
overdraft) of £2131. Yet another dividend is de-
clared ; but since it is probably impossible to pay it
in money, it is to be distributed in shares. Mean-
time the business has been seriously hampered, most
of the estimates with regard to the new plant having
gone wrong; yet the turnover has increased, and
there is room for a big further increase. But
whether the co. will pull through is another matter.
If it does, without a serious writing-down of share
capital, the management will deserve three cheers.
The debenture-holders are, of course, on a different
footing to shareholders. Total liabilities now are
£4531; and apart from goodwill and such-like
(rubbish, probably), there seems to be certainly over
£lO,OOO worth of assets. The shareholders’ best
hope of making their shares worth anything may
be to put up or get others to put up the necessary
capital on debentures (7 p.c.). That may save the
shares, and the debentures ought to be all right unless
the management is particularly rotten.

This co. was registered at the beginning of July,
1909, to take over the property of the Borehole
Collieries, Ltd., which had been formed three years
previously to work “Black’s” colliery, theretofore in
the hands of the Sneddons, who still have a big say
in it. It started off with insufficient capital; there
are 60,000 shares of 10s. each, and 6s. of this was
regarded as paid up. In part payment £15,000 of
8 p.c. debentures were issued. Later on it became
necessary to increase this debt, and there is now
£22,815 outstanding; but the interest has been
reduced to 6 p.c. On top of this the co. had to
hire coal-waggons, and that is always a costly busi-
ness; so, though it hasn’t earned interest for its
shareholders, it has had to earn interest for other
people. Further, the Borehole seam hereabouts is
rather thin, and it took a lot of development to
work up to an output of even 500 tons a day at the
end of 1911; and this development is charged up
with the outgoings shown above. On the whole, then,
and especially considering its heap of labor troubles,
the co. hasn’t made a bad start; though until the
Northern men get out of their habit of throwing in
their tools on the smallest provocation, the person
who invests in Newcastle coal invests chiefly
in uncertainty and worry, with no pros-
pects of gaudy dividends to compensate. Apart
from the debenture debt mentioned above, the
Stockton Borehole’s liabilities are £2017, while the
more or less liquid assets (excluding stores) run to
about £2500. » * *
At the meeting of the Zinc Corporation
in London chairman Govett supplied some figures
which the annual report overlooked. Of the 85,000
tons of zinc concentrate produced during the year,
55.000 tons were delivered at the average spelter
price for the year (viz., £26 3s. 4d.), and 35,000
tons were credited with the arbitrary price of £23
for spelter. The figures don’t tally. The 55,000
tons is evidently a misprint for 50,000, as this is
the agreed tonnage on which payment was made at
the average price for the year. The excess produc-
tion above that amount isn’t finally paid for until
perhaps 12 months later, as the buyers have the
option of taking it on the average of either the six
months or the full 12 months after the close of the
year, according to their view of how the tricky
metal market is likely to jump. The buyers have
thus a strong trump card to play when the occasion
demands. As spelter is now down somewhere about
£2l, there is the chance that the 1913 average may
be less than £23; if so, the co. may need to take a
cut out of the current year’s profits to square the
deficiency on the 35,000 tons of zinc concentrate
reckoned in at £23. Last year metal prices were
very high, and the co. received £16,000 as surplus
from the preceding period. It sold its 36,108 tons
of leady concentrates at the solid figure ot £lt
15s. 10d. per ton of lead. These prices are, ot
course, not going to last for ever, and anyone who
bases a purchase on the 1912 results is likely to get
sore about it before he has finished.
Because the Broken Hill cos. are very reticent
about their selling contracts, it is difficult to find
out what a person should certainly want to know
before taking a plunge, and that something is wfia
is going to be the difference in the profit when metal*
are on their normal level. There was a bit of skir-
mishing around this prickly subject at the meeti g
referred to. Govett declared that with spelter at
£23 and lead at £l3, there would be just enough
to pay a 6d. dividend—after, of course, the modest
pref. shareholders have had their 20 P-?- P ,a * ~
extra £1 for each metal or £2 for either \
mean an extra Is. dividend. H. C. Hoover also
a confession that to make a profit of £150.0
co. required a combined price of £39 per t
lead and snelter. AVith spelter at £2l and leadl also
at £2l, the extra £3 in price would give another
£63,000 to the co.
t^ gh Sfu T lc,e , on ? ma - v have a Shot at the vexed
nenfrof thus ’ In deal,n & with a decent-grade lead con-
centrate one may calculate to get a full recovery of
„!,. le ? d anc [ silver; after that, he must deduct a
realisation charge of somewhere about 80s. or 85s.
per ton of concentrate. Unless the zinc in this con-
centrate is unusually high (above 8 p.c.), it may be
disregarded. Then as to the zinc concentrate. First
oi all, eight units of zinc are put into the buyers’
pocket, after which he grabs eight units of lead and
ve of silver. In the Zinc Corporation's zinc con-
centrates there is not 8 p.c. lead, so he grabs all that
there is of that metal. Then he charges something
to smelt and realise on the concentrate, the amount
depending on the price of the spelter. Evidently the
principle is that the higher the price the more the
producer can afford to part up. The charge ranges
from £5 to £6 per ton of concentrate, or a trifle
more if spelter is very high. After all these deduc-
tions and charges the buyer is prepared to pay for
about 95 p.c. of the remaining zinc, half of the re-
maining lead (if any) and half the remaining silver.
So it is not difficult to see what sort of a cut Aus-
tralia loses by foreign smelting. Taking the Zinc
Corporation chairman's figures as to metal prices,
and allowing (say) 85s. as the realisation charge on
the leady concentrate, the Zinc Corporation
would have received £330,000 from these
concentrates, estimating that silver (the price
of which was not mentioned) averaged 2s. 4d.
per oz. The zinc concentrate (with a smelting and
realisation charge of £6 per ton) would bring in
£292,000. These two total £622,000, which com-
pares with £644.000 shown in the accounts. But
the £644,000 includes the £16,000 surplus from
the preceding period, and also a credit for 6000
tons of zinc slime saved from re-treatment by the
liorwood process. The slime may be worth £1 to
£2 a ton. The calculation is, therefore, pretty
right. Then this much further can be calculated:
if metals were to average in the future the same as
in the last 10 years, the yearly net profit, after
depreciation and redemption, would be £93,000, as
against the £225,000 actually reported.
As to that redemption. For every ton of tailings
used up, ss. is put aside, and forms practically a
fund for the return of canital, although, as pointed
out the other day, the accounts don’t show that it
is earmarked for that purpose. Something like
£60,000 or £70,000 goes into this fund every year.
At the end of the last financial year (December 31)
the co.’s surplus of liquid assets over liabilities was
£224,900, out of which £67,412 was payable in
dividend. The co. had six years’ life in the dumps
and another two years or so in the tailings to be pro-
duced from the South Blocks mine, which the co.
owns. In six years, setting aside ss. a ton on the
dump tailings, the co. should accumulate, say,
£350,000. This, with the surplus on December 31,
after allowing for the dividend, would total about
£520,000 ; and the capital is £672,261. The
directors’ idea is to play with the fund and try to
bring it up to £572,261 by the end of 1918; in
fact, according to the official report of the meeting,
they want to pay back not only the pref.’s £246,000,
but also “the original 20s. per share on the 653,000
ordinary shares.” Of course nearly half the latter
capital was written off long ago, when things looked
very gloomy; and there are probably few of the
shareholders left who actually paid the 20s. It
would be far sounder to treat the fund as a sinking
fund and allow it to accumulate in solid investments.
But that is far too slow for the Govetts. So, hold-
ing out the bait of a “return” of 20s. per share on
ordinaries and prefs. alike, though the ordinaries are
now only 10s. shares, the managing directors are
going to regard themselves as “an ordinary invest-
ment trust, with the ordinary powers of investment
and of underwriting issues which are exercised by the
successful investment trusts.” And by the unsuccess-
ful ones, too, it may be added. For instance, the
start at the old Sunny Corner doesn’t seem any too
promising.

The capital was only £12,500, so the mine doesn’t
owe the shareholders anything. Last year the co.
had the usual water-deficiency troubles, and of
late it has had to shift a lot of overburden ; but the
water supply is now good, and as the ground just
ahead won’t be so troublesome, there should be some
more dividends. Liquid assets are already a few
hundreds ahead of liabilities.

Cope’s Creek Central has had an even

alone shareholders got back £6OOO There wit
much left of the old Cope’s Creek leases, but the
co., having saved up a good reserve, has put over
£7OOO into plant to work another area on Skele-
ton Creek, where close-up to 200 acres have been
secured. So far as the co. has gone, which isn t far,
it is not rich ground; but with a fair tin market
there is profit in it. #
Ivanhoe (W.A.) is rejoicing over its

then bottom level at 2570 ft. This slate had also
made its presence felt in the two levels above, but
le good patches of ore were nevertheless opened
up at those points. At 2570 ft. there was absolutely
no good ore. The opinion of Dr. Maclaren that the
skte would pass away in depth, and that values
would make again, had a cheering effect on t .
otherwise depressed management, and as 7ft. of 4/ .

Westralia’s export of minerals other than
gold for the half-year ended June was valued at
,£ 112,265, or about double that for the same period
in 1912. Copper, tin, silver and silver-lead showed
substantial increases. Most of the tin sent away
came from Greenbushes, which has livened up a bit
lately as a result of suction dredging and sluicing.
Increased production at Whim Creek and elsewhere
helped to swell the copper returns, and a revival at
Northampton was responsible for the larger lead pro-
duction. The figures for the remaining half of the
year are expected to be better still.
Somebody must be a liar. In their recent
report to shareholders for the half-year ended May,
the directors of the Royal Oak, at Hancocks (W.A.),
stated that “if the State battery had been available
for regular crushings as required by the management,
the necessity for calling on shareholders to provide
further funds would have been obviated.” But an
official of the Mines Department says that no trace
can be found on the file in the Department of any
application by the Royal Oak for the use of the mill;
and as the mill has been idle a good deal of late
it seems certain that all the ore that the co. may
have been able to gouge out could easily have been
crushed.
Bullfinch Prop. (W.A.) has been dished
in regard to the Chaffinch lease. Some months ago
it induced the warden to recommend its application
for forfeiture; but the Minister has allowed the re-
gistered holder—a woman —to retain possession on
payment of a fine of £5O. An Adelaide syndicate
has been formed to do some boring on the property
on the off chance of picking up the continuation of
the Bullfinch main ore channel or something similar.
Marvel Loch (W.A.) has decided to take
The Bulletin’s advice and give its mine best. Low
returns, increased arsenical contents and a deluge
of water are the reasons for the decision. The
co. now proposes to go nap on the Comet option, in
which “several fine bodies of ore” are said to have
been found. Enough gold may be taken out to pay
for the property ; but as the shoots are more likely
to snuff out than go down, shareholders’ chances are
still uncertain.
Eastern capitalists are nibbling at por-
tions of Block 50 on the Hampton Plains (W.A.).
Several areas are being prospected in this locality,
and some look like turning out fairly well. One has
a big formation, from which a recent crushing aver-
aged 6jdwt. over the plates, with 4dwt. in the tail-
ings. Hamilton and other notable Italgoorlie mining
men are said to be favorably impressed with the pro-
spects of the field, but so far nothing good enough
for a big co. has been unearthed.
* * * *
Black Range West (W.A.), the Sydney-
owned “position” claim which always looked as
though it must hold something, is feeling better than
ever it did before in its long life of hard struggle.
What its present find is like can be judged best by
the fact that 930 z. of smelted gold has been cleaned
up from 1001 b. of specimens.
For putting up £150.000 of working
capital the London group, which had an option
over the Mount Oxide (Q. 1, was to get 275,000 shares,
and the present co.’s little lot was to be 200,000.
The Londoners have been squeezing, and apparently
they have scored to the extent of 25,000 shares. Any-
way, it is announced that a deal has been completed,
and that the new co. will be loaded with a capital
of £500,000. Fortunately the mine has been respond-
ing very well indeed to development -work, and the
money seems to be in the property.
In July Mount Morgan produced 9268 o!?.
of gold, which was more than the total output of
Charters Towers and Gympie (88260 z.). Charters
Towers treated 6807 tons for 56170 z., and Gympie
10,123 tons for 32090 z. The average value of
Towers stone was £3 Bs. 6d., and that from Gympie
only £1 6s. 7d. per ton. The Scottish Gympie
supplies more than half the tonnage at Gympie. Its
June return was 5488 tons for £5323. To try to
improve matters the Scottish intends to cyanide its
tailings; some steel vats have been purchased from
Mount Leyshon, and a tube mill has also been added
to the equipment. # .
One of the kind friends of the Long
Tunnel, Walhalla (Vic.), writes that a loss was
made over its last crushing. Of course; and it must
go on until the Board gets more stopes open, lo
cheer the new co. on the road, specimen stone has
come into the stopes over 3225 ft. ; but a few patches
don’t tally up like the old persistent seams of gold
that brought wealth to the Pearsons. The co. ought
to use some of the State bonus in working south at
1000 ft. towards the old South mine.
Britannia United, Ballarat East, has got
its sinking done, and will soon be pushing out into
the slates to look for the patches that £ av e kept it
going for half a century. Meanwhile the old hands
quietly gather in the loose scrip, knowing that with
cheap' work and tribute parties, very low yields bring
in fair divs. , *
Wat. Davies, F.G.S., etc., lately put the
yard-stick over the Towonga on the Kiewa River
near Bright (Vic.), and spoke thus: The reef is
composed of a massive and friable light blue snow
white, pale pink and dark blue matrix. Good!
“Impregnating the whole, and finely disseminated
through same? are traces of arsenic, and copper, and
iron in abundance (mispickel, chalcopyrite, marcasite
and write).” Better! “By joining m the march
of science, and sharing the triumphs of mechanical
invention and exercising good management, the
mine can be quickly made a dividend producer.
Best of all! Then, after being told how a hill-
spur butts against a lofty mountain,” we learn:
“Running almost parallel with the base fine of the
spur, and across its eastern slope, is a dpfi " ed >“ n ,
tinnn is lenticular ‘gash vein, coursing about north
and south.... It has a permanent appearance, lonp-
tndln'allv and vertically.” But what hard luck for
such a master V to have' V to work on such a wee show
as the Towonga. Davies, however, has Cox s Bi r ht
tin claim under review for Langford, and it will
stand the picturesque adjectives better than half
dozen Towongas. * * *
The attempt at copner mining made by
the Verran Government at Moonta (S.A.) cost•that
<4tatp £4O 000 The experiment was less disastrous
ion tw of the French co. which sold the property
S ?he Government, for it dropped about £250 000
The same property long ago was taken over by a
syndicate of miners, with a Labor member for Wa -
laroo (a practical miner at that) among them but
thev were unable to make a do of it. With these

Australian Phosphates, Ltd., is taking
i, svndicate which has been exploring the
° v f S of the ® Mount Etna Caves, near Rock-
uat’?Hnn fO ) The co. is in 30,000 shares of 10s.;
fullv-paids go to the vendor syndicate, and
members have themselves taken the 10,000 con-
tribuTing shares. The opening of the Queensland
tribut l * railway, which runs within a mile
Ftna will, it is estimated, land the stuff
it S3S.SSS. W • ton, .11 costs included.
Prospecting over about a tenth of the cave area
has, it is alleged, exposed 100,000 tons of guano,
averaging in nitrogen p.c., in phosphoric acid
12 p.c. and in potash 2 p.c. The Queensland Gov-
ernment’s standard puts prices per unit at nitrogen
165., phosphoric acid 45., and potash 65., which gives
a total value of £6 10s. per ton. The mining will
be all pick work ; treatment is covered by drying and
grading and transport to the rail by a light tram-
way three-quarters of a mile long. The Common-
wealth guano bonus has not been considered in the
question of value.
It looks as though the Austral-Malay
tin-prospecting co., formed by H. E. Pratten
and his friends a while back in Sydney and
Melbourne, had the luck to strike more than one
winner. The Ivamunting property, sold by the
syndicate and floated in London, has just been paid
for; the co. to work the adjoining Kampong pro-
perty is about ready for launching in London and
Sydney (130,000 shares) ; and now the preliminary
boring of the big Kota property hints at an average
of lib. of tin oxide per yard to an average depth
of 41ft. —a very payable proposition if the ground
is suitable for bucket dredging.

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*

aged 2s. 4d., making a total cost of 4s. 10d. per cub.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, August 11, 1913.
My Dear Abini, —
The new spring garb is fearful and won-
cJeriuJ. It follows no line in drawing, and
is flat where it ought to be round, and
bunched like a wrinkled jelly-bag where it
ought to lie as smooth as a glove. Colors
that make the African macaw look like a
tame understudy flaunt their gorgeous tints
with the wild disorder of the paints on a
youngster’s first palette. The sash is a for-
midable rite of the new frocks. It usually
hangs anywhere and falls down in front, or
over one hip, or in its old accustomed place,
the back breadth of the skirt.
Generally speaking, if the new models
tell the truth, the sash has nothing
whatever to do with the color scheme
of the parrot-tinted frock. It adds
another vivid dab and makes the
final scream in a gown which is bright yel-
low or scarlet for a start, inlaid with emer-
ald green (as something to go on with),
then hitched up with rosettes of violent
purple, and finished off with a few sunsets
or a new moon or two. The draping is
apparently the result of blind chance. Pre-
sumably some great man-dressmaker in
Vienna or Paris goes to a Futurist show.
He returns home and has an attack of
nightmare. He falls off his uneasy couch
on to a mad lobster that he has put there on
purpose. He rolls off the lobster, seizes the
quilt or the top sheet, flings it over the towel
rail, and drapes it to some likeness of the
worst Futurist picture that Paris can pro-
duce. Then he shoots it with a gun loaded
with paint. This is as near as I can get
to the origin of the spring fashions. Hogarth
missed a good deal by dying in 1764. Art
hadn’t properly begun to shriek then. It
was merely moaning in a minor key.
South Sydney is bounded on one side by
the smells of Botany. On the other angle it
has a lumpy hill to fence it off from Ken-
sington goff links. Anywhere else on the
horizon straggles Zetland, Waterloo and the
chimney stacks of Bedfern. About 80,000
bodies inhabit this thickly-populated area,
which is now the proud possessor of a new
and handsome hospital. Governor Strick-
land turned a gold key in an obliging lock
that opened something inside the building.
Joynton Smith, M.L.C., made several
speeches, and remarked as a preface to one,
that “no less a person” than Baronet
Cooper was present, at which the Baronet
winked facetiously at Mrs. Baronet. She
was clothed in all the pomp and circum-
stance of velvet brocade and waved a Reck-
itt’s blue plume on her handsome hat. Wil-
liam Cooper handed over his signature to
the amount of £5OO to the hospital on Satur-
day, and gave in the first place the three
acres of sandy sod on which it stands. He
is. a slender, elderly man with the typical
millionaire appearance of being just able to
keep the wolf from his palace gates. Ex-
Premier McGowen was not allowed to hand
out his favorite anecdote, “I gathered gee-
bungs on this spot as a boy” in peace. Sec-
retary Fred Flowers, M.L.C., interjected,
“You must have been web-footed then —
this place was a swamp.” Great anger
ensued, and the ex-Premier looked as if he
would demand his colleague’s head on a
dinner waggon or something. Lady Edoiine
drove out in her pet victoria and Avas
assisted to her place of duty on the
platform by one of the Cranbrook Kinder-
garten. Archdeacon Boyce attended the
ceremony in the usual gaiters and saucy
hat that go Avith his cure of souls. A few
hundred local inhabitants were present at
the fray. A bevy of small schoolgirls
squeaked like young mice in a tuneful wel-
come to his Ex.
The National Council of Women put on
its spectacles and best hats and sallied forth
to State Government House the other after-
noon. The purpose was to hold a meeting
to scan the reports of various overseas’ mem-
bers of the clan. The Strickland ladyship
was in the chair. Help Talbot and Col.
Campbell hovered discreetly on the horizon
and fled before the “Road to Ruin” and
“Worst Man” discussion was handed round.
Rose Scott sat at the official table, and
Mrs. R. McAnderson plied her fountain pen
as recording sec. As I have never yet been
able to unravel exactly _ what the National
Council achieves, I see its thousand resolu-
tions and innumerable minutes through a
dense fog. Mrs. Henry Dobson, who repre-
sented the Nat. Council at a recent parley
in Paris, fonvarded a voluminous re-
port, heavily embroidered with good works.
Temperance, hygiene, the importance of the
woman’s vote, and a general crusade against
microbes stud the account of the French
Congress. An osprey or two waved at this
meeting, and I noted that the gathering
didn’t pass a resolution exterminating the
wearers of this fascinating but murderous
Huff.
The committee of St. Vincent’s Hospital
Hall is backed up by a formidable array of
non. secs, and hon. treasurers. The president,
Mrs. Mayoress Cocks, holds the fort at
meetings which palpitate with new ideas.
Imagination reels before the inter-suburban
complications of 14 fancy sets. Hon. secs.
Mrs. O’Gorman Hughes, Mrs. Kenna and
Mrs. H. Kendall are officially supported by
non. treasurers Veronica Mort, Mrs. R.
Innes and Mrs. Bullmore. The handsome
Brennan girls (Edgecliff) are lending their
decorative appearances to the tableaux
which the R. E. O’Connor damsels are dedi-
cating to the galleryites. Mrs. Ronald
t orbes, who is built on delicate Watteau
lines herself, has stage-managed the Watteau
set which includes many scions of our old
nobility. A.D.C. Forbes forsakes his tartan
trews for the occasion, and will Watteau
round the wild grand chain. Mrs. Sep Levy
is going to dine and wine the Watteau set
on the evening of the ball, August 26.
St. Martha’s Home (Leichhardt) catches
the Young Idea (female persuasion) and
stuffs it with vital information and needle-
work. Martha, who was troubled about
many things, was not, I believe, the
lady after whom the island and whaling sta-
tion of Martha’s Vineyard was named. She
can hardly have been, for she is not men-
tioned as having whaled even once. But she
must have been the patron saint of lace-
making, for the girls who are trained in the
sunshiny home at Leichhardt turn out lace
as. gauzy as a butterfly’s wing or a poli-
tician’s promise. Last week, St. Martha had
a garden. f§te, and filled the hungry with
good things and sold the thirsty soft
drinks from innumerable stalls. Miss Strick-
land declared the fair to be well and truly
open, and the John Toohey dame (a buttress
of the Cause), Mrs. O’Gorman Hughes,
Mrs. Carmichael, Mrs. Lane Mullins, Mrs.
Porter and Mrs. Veech were amongst those
who also ran.
A few official personages were invited to
eat a scholarship dinner at the Tech. College
the other evening. The scholarship
girls are the bright particular stars of the
cookery department which is surrounded by
a firmament saucepans. Teacher in
charge, the bright-eyed cook lady A. M.
Monro, glides behind the schnapper a la
Marquise as oresiding angel. Minister Car-
michael, Under Sec. Board, Acting-Super-
intendent Nangle (Tech. College), and
others were bidden to the feast.
The Alliance Frangaise will mingle light
refreshments with an account of the Right
Way to handle irregular verbs, on August
Iff. Governor Strickland has given his vice-
r°yal word to be present at the ceremony,
which is the last of the present season. The
committee extends the glad hand to anyone
who. contributes 2s. 6d.. and is able to say
Oui. People who can’t say “Oui” are
barred, I believe, and told to'go out into
the wilderness and abide there for 40 days
while they acquire the essential mono-
syllable.
The-annual corroboree of the Kindergarten
Union will be held at State Government
House one afternoon next week. Lady
Edeline Strickland presides at this gathering.
Ihe business includes the usual heavyweight
items that garnish balance-sheets and £ s. d.
General Sec. Ellen Desailly is at present
chasing the uttermost farthing to its long
home in the audited account, and will sub-
mit same, without prejudice, to the assembly.
Mrs. A. C. Buchanan, of this town, and
three daughters, are still scampering through
foreign hat-shops. The two younger dam-
sels, however, have to temper French mil-
linery with Continental tongues, as they’re
booked for a boarding-school.
The Warwick Armstrong pair have been
poised on the wing in this city for a day
or two. Little Mrs. Warwick, in peri-
winkle blue the other morning, had the
latest remark in feathers waving on top of
her toque. The remark consisted of two
long, thin plumes standing straight up in
the air and rising about a foot above the
head. Some invisible support prevents this
frail structure from falling down dead, so
it shakes its phantom fronds like the ghost
of a note of exclamation. It’s the very
newest thing in millinery, but it has to be
handled with care.
A granddaughter of the late John Cecil
Read was married the other day to Henry
Horn, who belongs to a North Sydney family.
The bride’s father was the late Mr. Charlie
Read, whose male parent was Governor of
Darlinghurst Gaol for a good many years.
A large contingent of the Read relatives,
including William A"ero, of that ilk, assisted
at the ceremony.
The Oliver Osbornes, Mr. Jack McMaster,
the Frank Chisholms, of Goulburn, and the
Tindales, who are Armidale folks, are in
town as I pen this line. This sort of thing
cheers up the town considerably.
Various extensive properties in our best
suburbs are changing hands. Elystan, the
palatial mansion at Woollahra that used to
house the late James Marks and his kindly
wife (she has also crossed the River StyxL
has been sold during the past week. The
name of the buyer hasn’t floated this
way at the moment of gumming up the
present screed. The Spencer Bruntons have
been anchored at Elystan for a while. They
will move on to Glenyarrah presently, having
bought _ its picturesque chimney pots, its
walls, its terraced garden and all that is
within its iron railings from Alderman T.
H. Kelly.
Several local engagements are alleged to
tremble in the background at the present
crisis in Bulgarian blouses. A young man
who is something moderately tremendous in
the whisky trade (to put it another way, he
is a small giant in the business) is said
to have plighted his promise to a Society-
maiden in her early prime. A bachelor
pianist of considerable wrist power is also
suspected of an understanding with a well-
dowered damsel pending her parent’s ap-
proval. These events belong to the unreli-
able rumor species and can’t be more than
whispered in cold print.
Rose Bay Club goffers have drawn up a
new code. This is to restrain lady associ-
ates who are smacking the elusive ball with
raw inexperience from trampling down the
turf on the male golfers’ ground. A dark
suspicion that Woman is getting the whip
hand in these links has fallen like many
whales and avalanches on the committee of
ways and putts. Woman, in future, will be
firmly requested to keep her place—except
on special occasions—or tell her age.
The Petersham Choral Society, with S.
Vost Jansen in charge of the baton, is going
to produce “The Shop Girl.” J. C. William-
son Ltd., who hold the Australian rights,
offer no objection. August 16 is the open-
ing night.
Dora Ohlfsen will remove her picturesque
presence from this town on October 1,
weather and other unforeseen accidents per-
mitting. She has recently achieved a fine
medallion portrait of the Admirable King-
Hall, which is going abroad for its bronze
top coat. It catches a brilliant impression
in profile of this mariner’s horizon-searching
expression, a characteristic of most naval
big-wigs who command the lurching gait of
a few thousand tons of J. Bull’s ironmon-
gery. A study of the just-departed Admir-
alty lady has gone off in sections to be
bronzed in foreign parts. During the com-
ing winter in Rome the artist is going to
button herself up in her largest overall while
she prepares her wares for 1914 exhibitions
in Venice, Paris and London. She is a
great grand-daughter, by the way, of one
George Howe, who made his mark here in
1803. He was born in the West Indies, had
a few snacks of ink on the London Times,
then sailed for Sydney in 1800. Three
years or so later he published the first num-
ber of the Sydney Gazette and N.S.W.
Advertiser, at a net profit of £6O a year.
This was the princely salary with which the
Government of the day rewarded its first
official printer.
In spite of the groans of the 1913 house-
wife, Mrs. Hunter Street had to pay 2s. 9d.
before she called a pound of butter
her own in 1820. Bread was sd.
for a 21b. loaf. Tea was almost
priceless when shipping fell down in
green seas and wallowed into port a month
or two overdue. Howe, who died in 1821,
lived long enough to see the staff of life
ascend to sixpence per 21b. cottage loaf.
Still he got away from the evil that was to
come. In 1839 the Cornstalk housewife
paid for a 21b. loaf, and the ordinary
41b. loaf of commerce cost Is. lid. Butter
averaged half-a-crown per lb., and potatoes
were exactly twice their present price.
Cheese was Is. Id. per lb., and eggs about
2d. per egg. And in those joyous Freetrade
times a laborer acquired some ss. a day, and
general servants could be leased for £i4 per
annum. People lived then simplv by doing
without things.
The cable reports that several noted com-
posers, some well-known contactors, and a
few singers (with Caruso as a special note
of indignation), intend to form an anti-
chatter combine. Any person found guilty
of carrying on a conversation during the
trills of the operatic aviary will be removed
from the theatre. During the Butt-Rum-
ford and Nordica concerts here, the rustle of
programmes, and the cackle of the perpetual
talker went on without the slightest public
protest. A new species of usher, with the
chest measurement of a 6ft. policeman,
might be employed with enormous success.
He could also attend to the feet of those
persons who invariably kick the chairs in
front of them, by way of letting off their
superfluous animal spirits.
The Butt-Rumford team sang and fiddled
to a huge audience on Saturday night. The
Town Hall was full to the organ stops, and
the stately Clara had to continuously bob her
head to adorers on the dais, who had hardly
room to move their knees. The Butt voice
was in majestic tone-power, and the air was
thick with encores. Garbed in raven plum-
age, the mighty contralto kept her back hair
tidy with a few hundred-pounds -worth of
diamond bandeau. Her breathing apparatus
moved another decoration of the same gems
to fling out quivering blue lights from her
massive bosom. Alice Elgar’s heroic song,
‘The King’s Way,” and the classic “Crea-
tion’s Hymn,” were the solids of a fine mo
gramme. Gluck’s haunting ”Che faro” was
the only weak snot in the Butt warble the
other night. Mrs. Clara takes the legato
passages too roughly, and sends Orpheus
stumping through Hades on a wooden leg
whereas I imagine he glided amongst the
shades in velvet slippers, or went about shod
with air. Kennerley liumford repeated his
brilliant attacks on Alfred Hill’s vital Maori
lyric, “Waiata Poi,” and the torrential vocal
rapids from “The Barber of Seville.” Mrs
Butt’s elegant husband is singing up to his
best form since he quaffed Queensland’s sun-
shine. The tired little spots in his voice-box
noticed earlier in his present Australian
tour, have vanished. Solicitor Alfred Nathan,
who cultivates a melodious voice of his own!
ambled round to the artists’ den to shake
the Butt-Rumfords by the hand during the
smoke-oh interval.
Sydney’s Mayoress, Mrs. Cocks, has sent
forth cards to view Madge Titheradge at
afternoon-tea on August 18 The party
occur in the Mayoress’s official lair in the
Town Hall. If you miss the lift take the
marble stairs, or anything else you can put
your hands on, provided the municipal
Orderly Garrick isn’t looking. If you find he
has been looking and that trouble is about
to arise, the only thing you can safely take
is your leave.
Evelyn Beerbohm, who married the beau-
teous Elsie Anderson of this port, rises to
the surface with much applause as a lord-
ling in “The Butterfly on the Wheel.” Mrs.
Elsie and her Evelyn are located at an
Elizabeth Bay flat.
Now that the “Butterfly on the Wheel”
has settled down into her stride at the
Royal, the feminine spectator can dissect
the best parts of the dialogue. As com-
ponent parts of the truths that every woman
knows, the girlish friskiness of the Butterfly
becomes the choice wickedness of vicious
tongues. Madge Titheradge is uneven in the
torture scene, when Waller, as Robert Fyffe,
turns the legal screw, and she sheds her
emotion more copiously at later perform-
ances than in her first weep in this town.
Most Nice Girls, however, could bear a good
many of Mrs. Grundy’s spiteful asides with
fortitude, if they owned Madge’s Butterfly
wardrobe. The elfin night robe in which
she curls up her toes on the sofa is a mix-
ture of Oriental allurement and Western
discretion. Bacon and eggs desecrate the
breakfast scene in which the Butterfly tells
a few pale cream lies to her husband, in a
foam of white lace tied up at the waist with
a bow which is one of the seven deadly sins.
Proper feeling sends the reckless little flirt
to the Divorce Court in penitential black,
edged with the comfort of ermine. An
emotional white plume sticks straight out
behind the small black hat like the tail of a
moulting chicken. This decoration nearly
kills the pathos of Madge’s high-tension sobs.
It waggles like the plumage of the fowl just
mentioned when it totters on the back fence
before dropping into the next vard with its
beak full of maddened squawk.
The Women Painters’ show was torn open
by Mrs. Chief Justice Cullen the other noon,
r rancis Suttor, M.L.C., dropped a few pre-
liminary remarks, and the deed was done.
Mrs. Hedley Parsons dominates the oils
landscape section with a Turneresque
effect in sea and sky that floats round the
phantom shape of a ship in the offing. This
is indexed “Out of the Mists.” Only sec-
ond to this fine canvas is the same artist’s
Evening, Newcastle Harbor.” Violet
Teague’s “Boy with the Palette” is another
piece of brush work of unusual merit. Lilian
Chauvel, improved out of sight, with a large
splash of rose-tinted hill and water, “Break-
fast Creek” (Brisbane), is forgetting the
artificial style that marred her earlier daubs.
Ethel Stephens’ Bowl of Asters is a glowing
tribute to the Stephens’ way with still life.
Florence Rodway is half a staircase higher
than her everyday form in a clever picture
labelled Italian Girl.” Edith Cusack ex-
mbits her best work in a vital portrait study,
Giovanni Ferrago.” It is incredible but
true that the hand which painted this bold
and virile picture is responsible for a crude
canvas m lead grey, called “Evensong.” C.
Nevill-Smith shows a small study in sad-
eyed wallflowers and a portrait of her
brother, musician Nevill-Smith, of Maori-
land. Gladys Owen is dipping her brush in
gold and sunset shades to paint the lazy
clouds of “Early Morning.”
A small fire raged with great fury at the
Women Painters’ show for about three min-
utes on Friday afternoon. The cause, which
is generally diagnosed as the same in all
these flares, was a methylated-spirit lamp,
which spat out blazes like a small Etna.
Ruby Winckler’s decorative panel had the
misfortune to have nothing but a rag of
d £ a P er y between its back and a fierce tongue
of flame. A yawning hole in its middle
was its testimony to the tragic lamp. The
Fire Brigade savers stamped in after the
event. Their disgusted expressions, when
the inevitable female explanation, “Just go-
ing to boil the kettle for tea,” leaked out of
an agitated eye-witness, was a study in
male scorn framed in shining brass helmets.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

With Eight Illustrations by Lionel Lindsay.

By E. F. CHRISTIE.
PRICE, 1/-; POST FREE, 1/
Bush.
The power of the calling voice of the Bush is splendidly illustrated in this book, where a young
fanner marries a city girl and takes her to live outback ; but, although he provides her with every-
thing she can wish, her desire for “society” induces him to try residence in the Big Smoke. An
endless round of hollow pleasures soon satiates them, however, and the call of the Bush becomes so
insistent that they succumb, and finally find happiness in the country. .
This book is' full of humor, and some of the society people introduced are worth their weight in
gold to our readers. Indeed, their antics in the country turn the laugh against the town so completely
that, for once, the rustic scores. .

In this book we have one of the best Australian stories that have appeared for some time.
It is full of racing of the genuine sort, where both men and horses are triers, and the descriptions
of a few hard-fought finishes are brimful of life and excitement. ...
Naturallv, there is a woman in the case, and a “sport’ at that, and before the tape is passed for
the last time she has a few men so tangled up that they “dunno where they are. ™ie human ' nt .®' r s

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 11, 1913.
My Dear Yaerie, —
The Glaciarium carnivalled last week, and
G.-G. Denman stayed from beginning to end,
and trotted round complimenting nice girls
on the success of the various sets. He also
bestowmd some flowers .on instructress Miss
Fischer. The McEvoys, Frank Maddens,
O’Haras, Cleggs and Pinschofs all helped
to make pretty pictures. Lesly Madden was
Queen of the Butterflies, in the Butterfly
Pantomime. She skated primly, waving large
butterfly wings, and (in pantomime) re-
ceived the Fairy Prince and presented him
with an illuminated address. It was all
terribly alluring, and the John Madden dame
watched with great satisfaction. The mothers
were packed into special seats, where
they chatted and gloated over their various
darlings.
When the Homoeopathic Hospital was
raising the wind to help build a surgical
ward for its children, the Children’s Hospi-
tal was proudly opening its completed pav-
ilion, which contains the Edward Wilson
ward, the Frederic Poolman w T ard (mostly
built with the money of these two dead bene-
factors), and the Ann Higgins operating
theatre. The pavilion has balconies and
verandahs, the floors of which are on a level
with the wards, so that the beautifully bal-
anced cots can be -wheeled out into the
a.ir at any time without a moment’s discom-
fit to the little patients. G.-G. , Denman
brought his two children along to help with
the opening. The president of the committee
(Mrs. Turnbull) later on conducted the
assembly to tea. Mr. Fanning, the Edward
Wilson trustee, joined forces with dozens of
other people who had given substantial sums
and helped in other ways. Amongst them
were Mrs. J. A. Levey and Mrs. Sumner.
Everything to do with the Pierrot Ball,
in aid of the Homoeopathic Hospital, was
consistently in the picture. Ticketed pat-
rons w r ere allowed to look on from
the balcony; but no ordinary human being
who was not properly pom-pomed and
ruffled was allowed on the floor. The only
exceptions to the rule were a few hostesses
and the Excellency in attendance. Thou-
sands of big black paper balls hung from
the roof, and the lights were enclosed in
square orange silk lanterns. Some discreet
Pierrot-Pierrette washing hung on gilt lines
decorated with gilt pegs; it consisted of
long black stockings and short white socks,
all of which danced lightly when the
draught swayed them. The Gaud Mayoress
was sick and unable to attend for the hand-
shaking ; but a very richly-jetted, black-
satined Madden dame acted in her stead,
and received the G.-G., who seemed to be
twinkling cheerfully at the unusualness of
the charity spree. The quaint dress suited
most of the Best maidens.
Dr. Sehlesenger’s daughter Dorothy led
the Pantaloon Pierrots, who wore black,
with green crescents and ruffles. Jennie
Brenan’s many sisters made up an English
Pierrot set. and Miss Hyams’ following was
French. Thirza McLachlan’s team was
powdered and otherwise black and white.
Mrs. Heymanson put a dozen pale blue and
black frockers into the picture. All hands
carried sticks with gold and silver bladders,
and even the most sedate ventured to be
playful w’ith them. Theatrical folk arrived
about midnight and infused some fresh
spirit into the revel. Five o’clock in the
morning saw the end of Folly, and, unless
you lived close by, you got home just in time
for a bath and breakfast.
The Co-operative Craftworkers—a severely
practical band —have started business behind
a large plateglass window in Centreway.
Locally-made rugs hang about in a care-
lessly luxurious manner reminiscent of Asia,
and some examples of the pottery that the
Finlay brothers design, mould and bake, are
beautiful incidents in the decorative scheme.
Floor coverings, hats and cushions, all made
out of raffia, are also to be seen —and pur-
chased. Finally, artists are sending in real
pictures, constructed entirely of paint, can-
vas and imagination. The place is to be
run on business lines, and it is hoped to
make it a good and brisk market for local
artistic work. Those in authority encourage
the various workers to try and do the sort
of stuff that sells. Even misguided doers
of fancy work are given a chance.
All the country people hurried out to Caul-
field, on Saturday. There ' were Mani-
folds, from the Western District; Chirnsides,
from Werribee; Grices, from Mornington;
and Robertsons, from beyond Ballarat —all
of them with swift horses to watch and
shout for. Both G.-G. and G. attended —
and the lucky G.-G. drew the astrachan coat
for the day. A large and fashionable con-
gregation of aides attended them, and helped
to fill the vice-regal coop while the silken
jackets were glimmering round the course.
They looked so undistinguished that they had
almost escaped from the course before the
band noticed their absence and blew some
Anthem after them. Sporting medico O’Hara
wore the biggest check motor-coat on record,
and looked like two of himself. Mrs.
Pursey Chirnside looked blue but haughty
in white cloth. Sister Miss Fenner wrapped
herself sensibly in the family ’possum rug
cut into long strips. Norman Fenner
brought his fair wife along, wrapped in black
furs. Mrs. _ Alawa Buchanan held a bet-
ting book tightly and sported a pheasant’s
feather on end in her tam-o’-shanter. Some
women towed three-foot lengths of feather
through the wind. The Millers clanned to-
gether with the Curries and lunched cosily.
Russell Clarke, dowm from Rupertswood,
had his Tasmanian wfife in tow. The wind
made everlasting fun of the newest hat idea,
which consists of a flower, or a bow, or a
long stem standing straight up. Such things
needed wires to keep them upright on Satur-
day. Victor Hood, who is still visiting, kept
his glasses levelled at the galloping. The
vice-regal enthusiasm for the running horse
is drawing the Sex to haunt meetings that
used to be ignored by all dressy women. But
then it is easy to popularise horse-racing,
anyhow. Some poor, misguided women, de-
ceived by a mid-day burst of sunshine, went
out in spring frocks and, thus lightly armed
against pneumonia and doctor’s bills, met
the chill blasts of Caulfield heath. A visit-
ing Englishwoman was heard to moan for a
beautiful set of furs left in moth-safe storage
on the other side of the world. Someone —
the usual, bothersome “Someone” who knows
everything—told her that people never wore
furs in Australia.
Womenkind must have suffered badly from
damp feet on Bullawarra’s Steeplechase day.
Fur coats were associated w r ith chattering
teeth, bluey-purple faces, and gossamer-clad
ankles. Everyone shivered. It didn’t seem
to matter how heavily a woman was furred —-
the thin shoes and hosiery served to let in
the cold and make her as wretched as the
rueful visions of spring, with V’s exposing
their poor chests. A few tulle hats were
noticed. They looked about as appropriate
amongst the furs as a golf outfit in a ball-
room. One of our newest matrons flashed
late upon the scene in a paralysing Paris
creation, or mistake. Her furs did their best
to screen things from the gaze of the curious,
but the outfit from Paris was the sort of
thing that defied half measures or steps.
The lady wearer limited her stride, but, all
the same, everybody who looked could see
how far her skirt was slit up. These things
should be worn courageously, or not at all.
At a recent charity show some Personage
was booked to sit amongst the judges—all
of them social dames. Now the story goes
that, having failed to settle by friendly dis-
cussion which dame should sit at his illus-
trious elbow, the aforesaid females first of
all lured one of their number from the room
with a telephone call, and then drew lots!
As for the rumor that the first prizewinner
subsequently sold her seat by auction —
there is no truth in it. Anyhow, there doesn’t
need to be. The story is good enough with-
out it.
The Arts and Crafts of Victoria, which
institution was boosted by the domesticated
Carmichael lady, and patted on the back of
the blouse by successive vice-regal dames,
is going into new quarters at the Audi-
torium. Very soon, Governor Fuller, fresh
from the snow slopes of Buffalo, will in-
augurate the new venture, which will wear
the industrious sign, “Craft Depdt.”
The Women of Melbourne (that is to say,
the representatives of a dozen august club-
ettes) stood blinking on the steps of the
Auditorium, while a savage east wind threw
dust and road grit at them. But they hung
on bravely, for Nordica was nearly due. The
star had just endured the train journey from
Sydney and was suffering a few of the un-
pleasant after-effects of vaccination; but,
despite all this, she arrived becomingly
flushed, wrapped in a creamy-white ermine
coat, and underneath an osprey curved like
a cockatoo’s crest. This vision was straight-
way closed in upon by the swarm of women,
and enough fluttered after the first honey-
bringers to fill the big Auditorium. Then
someone in the dim distance smothered the
beaming visitor with flowers, and made a
speech which was full of blossoms and frag-
rant sprigs of English. Meanwhile a great
moan of admiration went up from the lis-
teners and lookers. “Isn’t she lovely!” went
round the hall like a wandering breeze. The
compliment was really won by Nordica’s
clothes, for only a little of her face was
visible. The singer, in replying, spoke on
feminine matters. She is a big-hearted
worker for the Sex’s comfort and well-being
—and thereby hangs a lot of her popularity.
At the same time she isn’t exactly a Pank-
hurst.
Nordica’s concert, on Wednesday last
week, was beautifully padded in the musical
sense. Tenor Dufault, at whose feet Mel-
bourne was ready to fall, having met and
worshipped him before, easily reconquered
the place with his first song. Violinist Hold-
ing, of the scarlet lips, has the dash of fire
in his bow that brings success, and he tri-
umphed in his turn. Pianist Simmons, who
adjusts his very round eyeglasses, flings out
his coat-tails from his plump form, and
tickles the piano persuasively, won all the
way. His are the sort of accompaniments
the" average singer yearns for and dreams of.
So Nordica, the Supreme Frocker, shone re-
splendently in a very melodious setting. The
much-jewelled star made her glittering en-
trance through the red plush curtains that
big Clara Butt almost demolished. She
wore a white dress cascaded with crystal
waves—or waves of crystal. If the under-
skirt had been sand-color, she would have
looked like a bay beach on a brilliant sum-
mer day. Outsize diamonds flashed in her
ears, and an emerald as big as a watch
glowed in her hair, while a bloated pearl
partly obliterated one finger. Half a peck
of diamonds, distributed round, dazzled the
beholder, and a curv'-i osprey boomeranged
out of her hair. After her first song, ushers
delivered scarlet and white blossom at her
feet- Some patriotic lmll-decorators had put
blue-gum bi.-.o- :es on the screen behind her.
There was some young spring foliage on
them —little fat, round leaves that outlined
themselves against the white wall and sent
refreshing breaths of gum scent stealing
through the hall. Seven Government Housers
sat and listened in an attentive semi-circle
on the balcony. G.-G. Denman, who headed
the party, was attended by Help Barttelot,
Secretary Guise and Chamberlain Nevill, all
of whom were lapelled in blue. The Bart-
telot dame sat with Mrs. Guise, who wore
purple- Denman looked bored —or perhap •-
it was his dreamy concert expression. A
dark-haired matron of some social import-
ance wore a blood-red feather in her hair.
Hugh Buckler, of Sydney’s Little Theatre,
had one wrist bound up, and his fair wife
alongside nestled snugly in a fur coat. Soci-
ety folk were fairly plentiful in the balcony
and body of the hall, but there was room for
more. Lots of people—many of them irrita-
bly nursing sore arms—hate to expend half-
guineas in the middle of the week. Society,
it appears, must have Saturday to show off.
A year or two ago, the cohorts of the rich
threatened to appropriate Friday night for
their show off, but, finding that the houses
were not always crowded on a Friday, they
changed their minds.
Nordica was audaciously gowned in cerise
and scarfed with purple for her Saturday
night concert. She “blossomed in purple and
red,” as Tennyson puts it, and mostly sang
as sweet as pie, in a ’Murkan way of speak-
ing. But when she came to “Angels Ever
Bright and Fair,” the prima donna’s diction
suddenly degenerated into Yankee cockney,
and the charm of the voice fell on irritated
ears. Not once, but several times, her appeal
to the angels was “Tyke, O, tyke me to thy
care,” until one began to think of dog shows
and the various kinds of tykes one has met.
Kaiser Willy, of Germany, has a favorite
scent, and, ’tis said, insists on the imperial
box being perfumed with it whenever he
visits the theatre. The representative of the
odor is now threatening to sprinkle Her
Majesty’s with it, for the first night of the
Quinlan Opera Co. A distinctive imperial
scent is rather a good idea. But it has its
drawbacks. The bomb-thrower has got a
nose as well as the loyalist.
Yolinin, the high-marking dancer who
enthuses football followers, is pictured in
the latest-arrived London Graphic dancing
with Lydia Kyasht, a beautiful Russian of
renown. Volinin is honorably mentioned as
a new man who had caught on and was
pretty nearly worthy of the exalted com-
pany of Kyasht. The paper’s respect for
Kyasht is almost overwhelming.
Anonymous letters are the ruling curse
just now in leisured circles. Tearful threats
of sooling on detectives are broadcasted by
the distracted victims ; but nothing is heard
to fall. Matrons who are up to their eyes
in charity schemes regard all but their most
trusted friends with the cold eye of sus-
picion. The latest disturbing missive was
received by a dame of great eminence. It
was written on the notepaper of a women’s
club and was unsigned, of course (or where
would the anonymity come in?). It accused
the dame’s daushter and another lady of
bazaar kleptomania, and when it was passed
round amongst the Paris hats, shrill cries
of indignation ascended in gratifying quan-
tities.
Jeff Stuart, one of the most popular Naval
Depot boys and a dancer of the “heavenly”
grade, has had a transfer. Melbourne girls
are looking alarmed and asking if there is
any danger of him ever being transferred to
another State. These are the sort of
national sacrifices that Society (capital,
please!) looks forward to with shudders.
There is a matrimonial boom in St. Kilda.
The latest maid to wear the ring is Ruby
Kennella, daughter of the John Dixons, of
the Esplanade. Her fianc4 is Rupert Min-
nett, of North Sydney.
There wms a duel, or something of the sort,
in a cafe, the other night. One of the two
youths involved is tall, while the other is
about up to his shoulder. The skyscraper
one played a practical joke on the little
one; and the little one, instead of taking it
calmly, bounded in wrath and hurled his
clenched fist at the joker’s nose. A scene of
unparalleled fury and devastation followed,
food and eating implements falling all over
the place. The little man triumphed more
or less, but the proprietor was the real
winner. Both contestants had to pay him
for the damage done.
Jack Manifold, son of the Willie Mani-
folds, of the numerous Camperdown clan,
was married last week to Barbara Grey-
Smith. Ivy Clarke, daughter of the late
Janet, helped the Grc.v-Smith sisters to
bridesmaid the and a small Manifold
child carried the bride’s train. The feath-
ered legions of Society were kept from roost-
ing on the ceremony by strategy. The wed-
ding was performed in the secluded
chapel of the Church of England
Grammar School, of which place the
bridegroom is an old boy, and the
bride’s father a still older boy. Jack’s father
has bought him a new place, which is handy
to the parental palace in the Camperdown
district, and there he will go on the land, as
all the Manifolds have done since the keen-
eyed great-grandfather spied out the fertile
corner of a then trackless wilderness.
Marian Manifold, daughter of squire Ches-
ter, looked on cousin Jack’s marriage as a
sort of dress rehearsal for her own, which
will excite the clan very shortly. Chester
bought a property from brother Eddy to give
to his daughter. The place includes a fine
old stone house, and the proud papa is having
it “done up” and generally renovated in readi-
ness for the bride. Fiancg Adams was for-
merly a mariner and ploughed nothing but
the angry deep. But latterly he has been
jackerooing, under specially favorable cir-
cumstances, and “learning the land,” i n
order that he may be worthy of his Manifold
bride.
Percy Duffus, of Dalgety’s, died last week
aged 33. He was essentially a man’s man
and was, therefore, admired by a host of nice
girls. He was an artist to the finger tips
and, who i not worrying over the day’s wool
tallies, was ever ready to work wonders with
a piano. It was seldom that the talented
amateur could be held down to a set per-
formance ; but there are many friends who
will never hear the music of “Bohbme” or
“Butterfly” without conjuring up delightful
memories of the good fellow and fine musi-
cian who is gone.
__ The new Professor of History at Melb.
Uni. has a wife who owns a famous mother.
Mrs. Ernest Scott was of old Miss Besanfi
daughter of Mrs. Annie, writer and lecturer’
thinker and theosophist. Ernest and his
wife came to Australia in i 892 for the good
of the then-young husband’s health. He
reckoned on staying two years, and proposed
to fill in that time on the Herald. His ill-
health has gone, but he hasn’t.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Appendreena Dramatic Club staged “The
Liars” at the Walkerville Hall on Saturday night.
Mrs. Geoffrey Burgoyne (better known to Club mem-
bers as Miss Lovie Oldham) and Mr. Latter played
Lady Jessica Nepean and Christopher Deering re-
spectively ; and did well, like the old stage-hands
they are. Mrs. Burgoyne swathed her slim height
in some graceful frocks, and Miss Ward and Miss
Robin were others who dressed like artists. Mr.
Clement May made Gilbert Nepean a quite impos-
sibly unpleasant husband, and Mr. Reg Sabine was
also extremely offensive. The cheerful Mr. Talbot
Smith provided the humor of the evening, and ex
cellent and likewise articulate humor it was.
Amongst those “in front” were the David Wilkies,
Mr. and Mrs. Morice and Miss de Lissa, Miss Coles!
Mrs. Belt and the Fred Levis, Dr. and Miss Plum-
mer, and Mrs. Angas Johnson.
Miss Williams had a score or so of her friends to
tea at “the Quack” —I mean the Queen Adelaide
Club on Monday. By the way, the Club is enlarging
itself. At present there are days when the dining
room proves all too small, and hungry members are
sent empty away—and as you doubtless know, my
dear, an empty member is one of the most passion-
filled objects on earth.
The Royal British Nurses’ Association is to benefit
by a ball at the Town Hall on August 19. The
Governor and Lady Bosanquet, a naval band and a
naval guard of honor are among the threatened
attractions.
Pianist Elsie Hall is still instructing small Prin-
cess Mary in the art of scales and exercises. She
fills in her spare time by playing at concerts and
the haughtier sort of At Homes.
Miss Eva Bakewell and Miss Joyce Waterhouse
have left for a week’s ski-ing and bob-sleighing at
Kosciusko.
Mount Braecken, the ill-fated Hays’ house at Vic-
tor Harbor, is to be transformed into a swagger
private hotel. It’s an imposing-looking place,
perched on the hillside overlooking the ocean, and
was gutted by fire just before Mrs. Hay and her
daughter sailed in the Waratah. Since then it has
been deserted, save for a faithful peacock, which
will now probably remain to be irritated by flippant
and irreverent boarders.
Mrs. Mitchell, who died at Fitzroy on Sunday,
was the youngest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R. Barr
Smith. She married Professor Mitchell some years
ago, and leaves two children.
The moan of the disillusionised was plainly audible
at the Adelaide Police Court last week. A youth
went bail for a strange young woman. She has since
faded gently away, and on Saturday the amount was
estreated. The value of the experience which the
trusting lad thus gained was £lO.
Mrs. Gregerson gave a small dance at Hindmarsh
to welcome home Mr. D. Evans, who has been in
Queensland for some time. Wattle blossom and
asparagus fern bedizened the hall, and supper was
served on an almond-blossom decked table. Amongst
the dancers were Dr. and Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Lloyd,
Mrs. Arthur Coles, Miss Coles. Miss Jean Wigg, the
George Gunsorns and Miss Pauline Schomburgk.
The big Victorian gaol at Pentridge has
got another advertisement, one that justi-
fies a householder living anywhere near
Pentridge in buying a large, vicious dog.
Some young Victorians were playing foot-
ball near the gaol recently, and one of them
kicked the bladder over the wall. It hap-
pened to be Saturday afternoon, when all
prisoners are locked up, and there are no
warders about, so there was nothing for it
but for the youth to clamber over into the
enclosure. He got the ball and kicked it into
the street again, and then climbed back.
No one gives the usual emphatic denial;
instead, the excuse offered is that, whenever
there are prisoners about, that wall is alive
with warders and other deadly weapons.
Still, even that isn’t too comforting; for if
anyone can clamber over the fence on Satur-
day afternoon, and then jump back again,
without being seen. Bill Sikes’s chance of
escape seems pretty good—so far, at any
rate, as the last obstacle is concerned.
From “Rosna” in London :
Just wedded in this village, Esther McCulloch,
grand-daughter of the late John Wagner, of Mel-
bourne, and Baron Albert Sadoine, of Brussels. The
ceremony occurred with undue flourish at the
Bavarian Royal Chapel, in Warwick-street, the bride
being upheld by her sister and a Fairbairn damsel,
while the bridegroom was supported in his hour of
joy bv a brother baron. The list of congratulators
included Melba and the Grey-Egerton dame, some
Bucklands and Metcalfes, and Count This and
Baroness von T’other. The wedding presents hav£
gone on to Australia, and the pair will follow theip;
in September, sailing thence to China, where thait
vague thing known as an appointment is waiting for
the bridegroom.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Speaker Morton and Ex-Speaker Willis
handed a joint opinion to C. G. Wade (leader
of the Opposition) last week in N. S. Wales
Assembly that must have stung like a boil-
ing adder. Willis, referring to the present
of £2OOO which was subscribed in 1910 “as
the price of Wade’s allegiance to the capital-
istic class,” said he had read that it was pro-
posed to send the hat round again. “This
mercenary.” he exclaimed, “allowing the hat
to go round.” Whereupon the faithful Fitz-
patrick asked if “this person” were entitled
to use offensive terms towards an hon. mem-
ber. Speaker Morton told Fitzpatrick (1)
that he must not refer to Willis as “this
person” ; (2) that Willis was “perfectly in
order.” Which would appear to show that
while it is officially considered bad taste to
call Willis a “person,” it is good enough for
Wade to be called a “mercenary.” Verily,
Henry is getting some of his own back.
Premier Jack Scaddan’s one hope of con-
tinuing to hold power in Westralia is that
the Liberals and so-called Liberals will
quarrel among themselves. Colebatch, an
ambitious young member —he who, as a
pressman, was once chased out of the re-
porters’ gallery—wants to oust Wilson from
the Opposition Leadership, and Wilson natu-
rally doesn’t want to be ousted. Then so
that some places other than Perth may
scratch out a little public money, a Country
party is incubating, which means another
probable split in the Liberal camp. If
Scaddan plays his cards well he may be
able to go on borrowing money and doing
other foolish things for a considerable time
after next election.
CAPTAIN COOK STARTS OUT.
....And its outlook is as big as ever.
— Joe, on Liberalism.
“All very fine this ‘ great explorer’ bisness—
but sometimes it strikes me as bein' a bit
too big!”
“B.”: Frederick Page, M.L.A. (N.S.W.),
the lanky Laborite who represents Botany,
has been scapegoated for his opposition to the
recent Referenda of the Australian Labor
party by losing the nomination for his old
seat at the State elections. Which is right
enough as far as it goes, but when it is
limbered up with the treatment handed out
to Premier Holman, who also deserted the
cause, the party appears ridiculous.
The visions of “Henry Ilorsecollar” :
The curse of the politics of south-eastern Europe,
where the war has been, is that too many nations
have possessed the country at one time or another, and
too many of these nations aren’t dead. The Greeks
and the Macedonians (who were Greeks of a kind)
owned this region early. The Romans stole it, and
it was ruled from Rome, wherefore the present
Italian, because he owns Rome to-day, thinks that he
has some dizzy sort of claim on the place. It be-
came Greek again when the seat of Roman empire
was shifted to Constantinople, and it took to owning
Rome; but the modern Greek (who is now largely
Goth and miscellaneous) and the modern Macedonian
(who is very hard to define) have ceased to regard
themselves as one people, and they put in separate
claims. Italy has at least three claims apart from
the old Roman ownership: (1) that the Roumanians,
who occupy part of the country, are alleged to be
the descendants of Latin settlers; (2) that Venice,
which is now part of Italy, owned a considerable
area of Greece for a time, as well as a bit of terri-
tory further north ; (3) that there was a temporary
Lombard Kingdom which occupied a big stretch of
the country, and Lombardy is now part of Italy.
France has a sort of claim, if it liked to press the
matter, because it once owned a great part of
Greece, and governed it well while the show lasted.
The Bulgarians got nearly the whole blessed place.
So did the Servians. They both reckon that their
ancient empire should be restored to them, on which
point the Greeks and Macedonians (at least they are
called Greeks and Macedonians) frankly differ from
them—at the point of the gun. Austria has a sort
of claim as the heir of the holy Roman Empire^ —
provided the new German Empire isn’t the real heir.
The Turks claim on the ground of conquest, but it
is reckoned that they have been disqualified through
inabilitv to hold their conquests. Apparently what
the place requires is a capable new master with no
very strong local traditions —someone who can start
fresh. Seeing that the Normans came, in part at
least, from Norway, and a piratical sort of Norman
King who ran a sort of pirate kingdom in southern
Italv was once a sort of boss in Athens, perhaps
Norway had better take over the whole insane
caboodle and use it as a fishing station.
There is peace again in the south-east of
Europe, save where Abdul Fez, the
Turk, keeps up a flicker of warfare north of
Adrianople. The smaller wild cats have.all
signed a treaty of peace, and the only reason
for supposing that they won’t depart from
it next week is that they are very tired and
ruined cats, with their tails in splints, and
it will be years before the fur of three of
them grows properly again. Now £he Great
Powers have only a few casual little jobs
left on their hands. They have to suppress
Abdul Fez, the Turk, without falling
out among themselves through mutual sus-
picion. They have to organise the new
kingdom of Albania, and to find a reliable
king for it (the case calls for a really tre-
mendous sort of king, yet he will have to
live in a mean town, and his salary, until
things look up, will be about 2d., paid
irregularly). They have to prevent the
score of shrieky little tribes within the
Albanian borders falling out among them-
selves, and to prevent them falling out with
their neighbors, and their neighbors falling
out with them. And then, provided Russia
doesn’t happen too. conspicuously over the
border into Armenia, by way of bringing
pressure to bear on Abdul Fez, and
Austria doesn’t begin expanding too promi-
nently in the new kingdom in the interests
of peace or something, and Italy doesn’t
get too mad over its dream that it ought to
recover the bit of territory in the Balkan
peninsula that used to belong to Venice, and
Britain can get out of its habit of stealing
Turkish land in a friendly way whenever
the Turk is “up against it,” everything in
the garden will be heavenlv. On the other
hand, there is still a nossibilitv that every-
thing in the garden will be hell.
The contrast afforded by the contemporary
sittings of the Maoriland Parliament and
the “Unity” Labor conference is anything
but helpful to up-
holders of the Party
Government curse.
Attended by 400
delegates, the confer-
ence concluded its
business in nine days,
while Parliament,
after sitting longer
than that, had not
passed or even dis-
cussed a single mea-
sure. Charges of
spoils to the victors
and much delving in
old Hansards is all
that Maoriland has
got during the first
fortnight of the
present session for
the £1 per day which
it pays its members.
From a N.S.W. pressman who had to sit
out the Vic. no-confidence debate: —
The debate manufactured by the Argus and put
on the market by McLeod brought out three things—
the resourcefulness of Premier Watt, the weakness of
his followers, and the smallness of the Labor party,
mentally and numerically. The dark, clean shaven
Watt towers over everybody else, and he knows it. He
has a fine command of language—vitriolic, persua-
sive and denunciatory—and reminds one of Holman,
of the Ma State, though his utterances are more
vigorous. When this has been said, praise has been
exhausted, for the Victorian Liberals have no other
tall poppy in their garden, while the Labor party
has none “to equal Griffith, Trefle, or even Edden. It
looks now, after McLeod’s crab-like crawl-out, that
Watt will run the Victorian Parliament indifferent
as to whether he satisfies the Argus or not, despite
the paper’s ardent desire to fill the job of king-
maker, once occupied by the Age.
IMPENDING JUDGMENT.
A remarkable political development of late is the number of disgruntled politicians and would-be can
didates who have “ratted” on their respective parties and launched forth as “Independents. "
THE HARITUALS : “Traitors! Cowards !” THE DESERTERS : “Bah! Fools!”
Prime Minister Cook is supposed to be a
strenuous Freetrader, yet two of his three
nominees on the inter-State Commission
which is to report on tariff matters among
other things—are strenuous Protectionists.
One of them (Lockyer) is a Collector of
Customs, who knows a great deal about im-
portations; and the other (Swinburne) is
an engineer, business man and company
director, who knows a lot about Australian
industry. Piddington, the Freetrader, is a
lawyer, and is supposed to. be full of bottom-
less research about the intricacies of the
Constitution, but when a question of tariff
reform arises the two Protectionists will
be the Men Who Know. It is inferred, in
consequence, that Prime Minister Cook has
no intention of wrecking his job in the in-
terests of the Freetrade superstition.
THE NIGHTMARE.
Melbourne, July 30.
Merchants and manufacturers are complaining of
the further increase in inter-State freights by the
steamship companies. In the past the practice has
been to make small advances of 5 per cent, or less,
but the latest addition is one of 15 per cent., making
a total of 20 per cent, in the last six months.
“ I’m the thing you didn't kill on the 3Ist of
May last.”
It is charged against politician Levy of
N.S.W. that he declared the sins of the
Holman Government to be “as thick as the
autumn leaves that strew the brook of
Vallambrosia.” That is the trouble of using
unfamiliar figures of speech. If Levy had
said “as thick as rabbits at Jamberoo” he
might have been on safer ground.
By the Parliamentary reporter:—
The gentle art of stirring up the other man by
unpleasant interjections has resumed its course in the
N.S.W. Assembly, and decent members sigh for
the touch of the vanished boot of Willis, the strong
kicker. Ever since Willis called in the police to
give an ex-Minister of the Crown the frog’s-march
out of the Chamber the Liberals have hated him —just
as any Towzer hates the foot that keeps him out of
the dining-room. The Laborites never loved him,
and loved him less than ever after he had one of
their party emptied out suddenly when he got his
back hoof “over the traces. The serene impartiality
of Willis commanded the respect of everybody outside
the House, and roused the hatred of everybody inside
of it. Somewhere in the small hours of Friday morn-
ing Hollis was addressing the House, and Cohen, of
Petersham, interjected, and finally he rose to a point
of order and inquired if Liberals could not be pro-
tected from blackguards. Later on, in the lobby,
he got a concussion that quite recalled old
times —the old times of Parkes and co., when
hon. members dragged each other all over the pre-
mises, and there was great howling and much bat-
tered belltopper in the land. Still, there is this to
be said for the N.S.W. State Legislature: Never did
it witness the spectacle of a large hon. member try-
ing to seat a small hon. member on the fire, and a
prompt hon. member shooting the aggressor in the
interests of peace. And one of the most aristocratic
Legislatures in Europe once saw three peers mixed
up in a scuffle of that sort.
D. Levy, one of Gregory Wade’s tame
satellites in Ma’s Assembly, was raging at
Holman the other night for not having con-
tradicted a statement which had been attri-
buted to Holman by the newspapers, if, as
Holman alleged, it misrepresented the facts:
Levy: If that statement as it appeared in the
newspapers was not correct, why did the hon. mem-
ber not contradict it ?
Holman: Will the hon. member permit me?”
Levy: No, I will not.
That’s what they call strategy in Ma’s am-
phitheatre.
A new member who will be more uncon-
ventional than Meehan of the Mulga was
elected to the N.S.W. Assembly last week.
At least that is what it amounted to when
Jabez Wright got the Labor nomination for
one of the Barrier pocket-
boroughs, vice Griffith.
Jabez is just about the
prickliest porcupine among
the old Broken Ilill
irrepressibles. Broken Hill
Laborites view employers
with deep suspicion. Jabez,
who for years has had almost
a monopoly of the burying of
Broken Hill, is the excep-
tion. He was the first Labor
mayor in Australia, and if
the Speaker wants him to
wear a coat at the opening
of Parliament he will have
to argue the point first. And
if Jabez gives in on that
(assuming that he ever gives
in on anything) he will cer-
tainly baulk at a collar. But
he will work and he will
talk, and he will make things
a lot more uncomfortable for
the traitors and drifters of his own side
than for even C. G. Wade.
How they hate Socialism, these farmers!
At one day’s sitting of their annual conven-
tion at Maoriland this is all they would
have to do with the wretched thing:—
The conveyance of agricultural lime from the
nearest available source of supply upon the railway,
any distance, free.
Freight on manures to be the actual cost of haul-
age.
Excursion rates on the railways during winter for
the benefit of farmers.
Encouragement by the Government of the impor-
tation of pedigree stock by reductions of freight and
guarantee charges.
Cheap telephone service to settlers outback.
Government imported labor, preferably British
youths, who will thankfuly accept a few shillings
(about 7s. 6d.) a week.
Government veterinary surgeons to be made avail-
able in all country districts at a small fee.
Inland mails to have priority over passenger ser-
vice.
If the honest farmer ever did decide to go
in for Socialism what a whale, and what a
burning elephant, he would make of him-
self !
Tom Slattery has again come into the
public eye in N. S. Wales, this time with a
claim against the Government. In the early
’9o’s Tom was Minister for Mines and Agri-
culture. In Aoril. 1892. his chief, George
Dibbs, went to England on a mission, which
yielded a knighthood, a big cigar and a his-
torical Damn. The expenses of the trip
(£lOOOl were paid from the Treasurer’s ad-
vance account. To reimburse this account,
the sum was placed upon the Supplementary
Estimates, and it was only when the latter
were tabled that the House knew the money
had been advanced. Members took it
badly. Slattery thereupon gave his
cheque for the thousand. Friends of the
party subscribed and handed him about half
the amount; and now Tom, who isn’t the
affluent attorney that he used to be ; wants
a Select Committee to inquire into his claim
for the balance.
A NIGHTMARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If there be truth in half the tales
Of the man with the holy chiv,
Then good-bye, Sunny New South Wales,
I’ve no desire to live.
He says I’m brother to Ah Foo Sin
And Monkishuma too,
While Tommy Tanna’s my next of kin!
Shoot me, somebody, do !
I dreamt one night I dwelt a space
In a world that is yet to be ;
In a crowded mart I saw a face,
And the creature looked at me.
He was white —in the way the Chinese are,
But his almond eyes were blue!
He told me I was his grandpapa !
Shoot me, somebody, do!
He walked between two baskets slung
On the ends of a long bamboo ;
His father, he said, was Sum Thing Hung,
And he came from Sum Where Foo;
His mother (oh H —1!) was a girl of mine!
(That dream must not come true) ;
Lest I be father to such a line,
Shoot me, somebody, do!

“CATCH PENNY” SCHEMES
m
cannot atone for “pinch penny” tailoring. Any tailoring business
can get customers, but not many get them to “cling.” The truth
is, they attract them with a reduced price. The result —dissatis-
faction. We, on the other hand, believe that business men of to-
day prefer to pay a legitimate price for their clothing, and get
satisfaction all through. We believe that they would rather have
their suits absolutely right—regardless of price.
We find, too, that such men come here for their suits to be made.
Why? Because we employ an expert tailoring staff—use only the

Steeplechase in fine style, brought off The Bul-
letin’s “double.” Last year this paper, with its
straight-out selections of Guncap at Flemington and
Uxbridge at Caulfield, got one leg in for each of the
big jumping “doubles.” Last month it got half a
leg in only with the tip of United Kingdom and
Leah Kleshna for the G.N. Steeple. But the Caul-
field selections were successful in both cases. Ballista
started at 10 to 1 for the Hurdle, and Bullawarra last
Saturday went out at 7 to 1 for the Steeple, so the
“double” even at s.p. was an 80 to 1 chance. Let
it be counted to The Bulletin for past righteous-
ness when its future occasional tips prove sinfully in-
correct. Such great efforts of prophecy are apt to
leave the local oracle in a state of exhaustion for a
while.
Acceptances for the Australian Steeplechase boiled
down to 13, but they all went to the post. More-
over, eight of them completed the course—a good
average for the 4-miles race, which entails 26 leaps
into the air. Leah Kleshna made the running after
the first mile or so, until the very last obstacle had
been cleared. The mare was not rushed to the
front; she simply jumped her way into the lead,
gaining quite two lengths at each fence by her
lovely spring. At one point she was leading by a
dozen lengths. In the latter half of the long jour-
eny only Vanguard and Bullawarra looked at all
likely to catch her if she didn’t fall. And Leah
Kleshna never falls. The mare was still in front of
Vanguard as they made for the straight after all
the timber was done with, but then Bullawarra came
from third place into the lead, and the race was all
over. The 12st. 11 lb. horse won by four lengths, and
Vanguard (list, lib.) finished nearly half a dozen
lengths in front of Leah (12st. lib.). The time was
under Bmin. It was not a record, but only
three times in 27 years has the time been under
Bmin., and considering the heavy rain over-night and
again on the morning of the race, Bullawarra's per-
formance ranks with the best. Needless to say that
the great horse was well ridden by McCabe, who
steered Obi to victory in the G.N. Hurdle last month.
No animal that has been ridden feebly or inju-
diciously can win a 4-rriiles steeplechase unless the
rest of the field toppled over.
Sea Prince, the alleged dead bird for the Caulfield
Cup, had a go at Caulfield on Saturday, and per-
formed very indifferently. This form would have
gone for nothing as a guide to the English horse’s
Cup chance had the stable not expected him to run
much better. Two or three weeks ago Sea Prince
met with an accident, and got considerably cut about.
This race was accepted as a test of how much the
mishap and subsequent stoppage in his work had
mattered to the chestnut son of Persimmon. Appar-
ently it had mattered a lot, or else the much-glorified
steed is not a handy horse to manage when he gets
badly placed in a field. Sea Prince will have to run
again in public ere his reputation for brilliancy is
restored. Anyway, the popular Victorian double for
the two Cups—Sea Prince and Uncle Sam —looks
very sick. The tales told of giddy Uncle are quite
discouraging.
The other day the record price of
£45,000 was paid by J. B. Joel for the Persimmon
horse Prince Palatine. There were certain condi-
tions with the sale. Pilkington, the previous owner,
says the horse must not be exported from England,
while Joel stipulated that should the Prince suffer
defeat in the Goodwood Cup (which he did a few
days later) the price was to be reduced to £40,000.
Even at £40,000 the price is a record; the highest
hitherto was the £39,375 which the French sport
Blanc paid for Flying Fox. Diamond Jubilee
fetched £31,500, Cyllene £31,500, Ormonde
£31,250, and Jardy and Val d’or (two of Flying
Fox’s get) brought £30,000 and £28,000 respect-
ively. #
Sydney lacrosse came to the end of its
second round on Saturday, and the result of the
various upheavals didn’t alter the position of the
top-dogs in any way. The only riot on which any-
thing depended was that between Mosman and Birch-
grove, and by making a draw of it with a goal each
Bircbgrove lifted itself into the semi-final. Eastern
Suburbs continued its devastating course, and devoured
University by nine goals to two, while Petersham
jumped on Burwood by four to two. An ozone trip
to Manly evidentlv agreed with Sydney, which slew
the Villagers on their own seaweed by 14 goals to two
—the greatest murder of the afternoon. The clubs now
left in the semi-finals are Eastern Suburbs (27
points), Sydney (21), Petersham (17), Birchgrove
(15), and nothing short of a deluge or an earth-
quake will deprive Eastern Suburbs of the premier -
ship. #
Sydney baseball semi-finals on Saturday
were worm and gall wood, so to speak, to the lead-
ing clubs in the premiership scramble. All lanes,
highways, backstreets and bridle-tracks led to Peter-
sham on Saturday, and were flooded with about 3000
barrackers marching to watch the fray. The sur-
prise of the day was the crushing which Petersham
inflicted on the" North Sydnev-Mosman mob. _ At the
end of the seventh innings Mosman led by nine runs
to seven, and then Sheol broke loose in the last two
biffs when Petersham amassed the gigantic score of
13 runs to Mosman’s one, and so came out on the
roof of things by 20 runs to 10. As a curtain raiser
Leichhardt smote Lane Cove to fragments by nine
runs to two —a good, solid drubbing. For the rest,
Waverley slew Burwood by 32 to three —which is aw
unspeakable downfall, and is the record walloping
for the season in first grade. University climbed
laboriously on top of Paddington with 14 to 10. The
semi-final stands thus: Mosman-North Sydney, 11
wins; Lane Cove, 10; Leichhardt, nine and Peter-
sham seven. So the premiership appears more doubt-
ful than ever.
The revived Amateur Athletic Association
in S.A. has started to justify its existence by holding
a cross-country championship. Amateur running is
a sport in which Adelaide has been strangely uninter-
ested in fact, this was the first local event of its
kind. Of six teams three were from the
Y.M.C.A., which has a big membership of new-chum
Britishers brought up on the game. Their first team
ran first, second, third and seventh. University was
a moderate second. Flynn, an Irishman, did the five
miles of racecourse and grass-land, with a lot of
fences, in 28min. 35sec.. and Soutar was only 9sec.
behind him.
Although the French Grand Prix was run
off on July 12, the results have been announced only
last week. Formerly the first past the post was the win-
ning car, but this year it was a reliability contest as
well as a race, and that took some working out. The
result was a victory for Continental tyres, which
have now carried off the honors two years running.
The ability to get rapidly over the face
of the planet Mud per boot is a national asset in
time of war, and Maoriland has some promise and
hope in that direction. It found it out about a
fortnight ago, when Lieutenant Brown, of Nelson,
slithered over 113 miles in 31J hours. What sort
of country he did it over is not mentioned, but
Maoriland roads, excepting in Canterbury, are gener-
ally pretty dreadful. So if the rest of the Maori-
land army is anything like Lieutenant Brown, in-
vaders will have to bring motor-cars to hold their
own with it.

The billiard tournament at the Victorian
Club, Melbourne, went to one of the local bookies
this year. W. Gerrard was the annexer of the a 100
prize. He and his opponent in the final heat were
both in the middleweight division —95 and 85 start
in 250 up —but neither of them played much above
ordinary “mug” class. The runner-up, who made a
22 break early in the game, subsequently struck a
bad patch and scored 13 only in 10 successive tries.
Gerrard, who “amassed” a 22 break in the last
stage of the game and thereby paralysed the other
fellow, had previously gone eight times to the table
without scoring at ali. The betting crowd at a
Victorian Club billiard tournament gets a lot of fun
for its money.
By overthrowing South Sydney on Satur-
day at Sydney Cricket Ground in the presence of
over 25,000 people, Eastern Suburbs Rugby League
team put the result of the premiership competition
beyond all doubt for the third successive year. The
Royal Agricultural Society’s Shield is now the perma-
nent property of the club, and so is the President s Cup.
The premiership is its for another year. Of 12
matches played during the season, it has lost only
one, to the boots of Newtown. It has 24 competi-
tion points to the 19 of Newtown, the 18
of South Sydney and the 14 and 10 of
Glebe and North Sydney respectively. Balmain,
Annandale and Western Suburbs are nine, six and four
respectively. What little chance South had of defeat-
ing the premier team was spoilt by over-anxiety,
which caused the players to lose chances when they
happened. East Sydney team, on the other hand,
never played more coolly. In the first half the game
was very even, and East led at half-time with nine
to seven. After that, South’s nerves cracked up,
and it never scored a point, while East scored a try
and added the points, and so won by 14 points to
seven. Annandale, as the prophets said, has struck
form and got the confidence in itself which its plucky
play throughout the season deserved. After the shak-
ing-up it gave North Sydney the previous Saturday,
when it scored 20 to the Hillmen’s 18, everybody ex-
pected it would defeat Western Suburbs, and it did
.—by 18 to nil, chiefly through the brilliant work of
the back machine. Glebe found itself altogether too
slow for Newtown in the second half. At the inter-
val the scores were six all, but the Glebe boiler had
apparently burst, and while it added three points
Newtown piled up 22, and won by 28 to nine. North
Sydney revenged itself for its defeat by Annandale
the previous Saturday when it fell on Balmain and
chawed it up by 19 points to five.
THE “CHOSEN ONE."
Referee Snowy Baker decides Saturday's
argument in favor of Mat Wells (Colienland).
Hughie Mehegan is astounded and dissatisfied.
The Sydney Soccer struggle for the Raw-
son Cup raged more furiously than ever on Satur-
day, four matches being played off to the glorifica-
tion of Balmain and Newtown mostly. Both these
olubs maintained the advantage already gained.
Balmain met Annandale and fell upon it, beating
it by two goals to one. Newtown did the same to
Sydney by the same figures. Northern Suburbs
came down from its hills and smashed up the swamp-
men of Canterbury by a goal to nil. Glebe was
the bright particular star of the day—it fell on the
iron-workers of Granville and chewed them up with
five goals to three.

Owing to the fact that Queensland and
the Ma State XV’s were playing an inter-State
match on Saturday the Rugby Union contented itself
with one club match as a preliminary to the star
item. So St. George and North Sydney rolled on
each other cheerfully in the presence of about 1500
people. It was a most surprising sort of game, in
which North galloped over the Illawarra men in the
first half to the tune of 13 to five. St. George seemed
to have literally no hope. Then came the second
half, and North Sydney started with a burst of splen-
did confidence. But some magician had apparently
waved his wand over the dispirited St. George team,
and changed it altogether, or filled it with steam of
something. For all in a flash St. George became ag-
gressive, and continued so. North Sydney did not
seem to wilt, but St. George boomed, and piled up
14 points, while North Sydney failed to scrape any
more together, and so the saint that killed the large,
mythical animal won by 19 points to 13. >
The inter-State struggle was interesting,
the teams being most evenly balanced. The parties
led alternately in the scoring till a few minutes before
the whistle. ” Then Queensland got one point ahead
—and stayed there. Queensland opened the scoring
with three for a try. N.S.W. equalised it. and then
added a full goal, and so got a lead of five points.
Queensland crept up to six to eight, and then, adding
a try, was nine to eight. N.S.W. added an uncon-
verted try, and led with 11 to nine. Just here
ball burst, and with the new sphere N.S.W. bounded
up to 16 to nine. Queensland, with a try, made the
nine into 12, and then added a full goal and led
with 17 to 16. N.S.W. came with a fine charge and
lifted the score to 21 to 17. The shadows were
growing long, and Ma’s chances began to glow, but
there was another sudden onslaught by the Maroons,
and Queensland's score was 22 to 21. The minute
were running out and the Ma State team made tie-
mendous efforts. A series of wild battles took place
on the Queensland line, but the visitors managed to
pitch the Cornstalk crowd back over the whiting
every time, till the whistle went and relieved the
agony. . *
Though two games will complete the Vic.
League first found, it is still impossible to name the
four clubs which will battle out the finals. Roy,
’Wood and South are sure of places, and any one
of the three may grab the double chance that goes t°
the leading team; but either St. Hilda or Carlton
may scramble into fourth place. On Saturday Roy
encountered South in a high wind, and a fast, open
and willing scuffle ensued, with 'Rov always on top
by surer and smarter handling and better method.
For the first three-quarters the Red-and-Whites fum-
bled and blundered and when the last term started
they were 22 points behind. Then their marking
and combination improved, and by hard, steady plug-
ging, they piled on 20 points to ’Roy’s one. Only
time saved the latter from defeat —59 points to
South’s 56. On the day’s play, the Collingwood of
a month ago would have trounced either team ; but
’Wood has struck the internal trouble that spells
disaster. Consequently the Magpies only beat Var-
sity with difficulty the Week before, and on Saturday
the Saints stamped them flat—B2 points to 44.
Unless ’Wood can come to a working agreement of
some sort, it will win no more games this season. It
took Carlton all its time to hang on to its “final
chance, its opponent, Richmond, being still a propo-
sition to be reckoned with ; but it managed to make
63 points to 61. If ’Varsity, which collided with
’Don, had played throughout the season as it is doing
now, it wouldn’t be where it is ; and neither would
’Don. The Students led until the last quarter, but
in that term the ’Dons piled on points at such a rate
that they ultimately won by a pair of them. There-
with vanished ’Varsity’s last chance of winning a
game this season. The Students have still South and
Richmond to meet, and they have Buckley’s chance
of beating either. Geelong was at home to Mel-
bourne, and, perceiving at half-time —one goal eight
behinds to Melbourne’s four goals one behind—that
something was amiss, bogged in with such ill-directed
vigor that it finished up with four goals 23 behinds
to Melb.’s four goals two behinds. #
In the Vic. Association games Brunswick
made its position secure by downing North —74 points
to 52—and thereby raised ’Scray to first place and
itself to second, while deposing North to third.
Next week, in the last game of the round, ’Wick
will doubtless do its utmost to gain first place by
beating ’Don, provided ’Scray draws or is beaten by
P’ran. If it does so, ’Town, which has a soft snap
in Brighton, will step into fourth place, and ’Don
will slide into outer darkness. This will serve Don
right, for on Saturday it concussed with the same
’Town, and retired with a punctured reputation—
’Town, 54 points; ’Don, 45. P’ran, which won its
first six games this season right off the reel, threw
its last chance into the dustbin by playing second
fiddle to the despised Northcote. An untidv and
unmannerly scrimmage ended in ’Cote gaining 49
points to P’ran’s 45. ’Scray stamped on Brighton
with 89 points to 43; and Port put together 16
goals to Melb. City’s three. There were also a num-
ber of behinds, but they don’t matter. Nothing
matters that happens to the Melb. Citizens.
As these later scrimmages grow keener casualties
become more frequent. Still, the barrackers behave
themselves, which is more than can be said of those
at the Scotch v. Wesley College scuffle on Fridav, at
St. Hilda. Here the lighter and smarter Wussleeans
held their own up to lemon-time, after which the
weight and strength of Scotch told and carried it to
victory by 59 points to 34. At the last change of
ends some ill-mannered Scot breathed “Wowser .
into the ear of a Wesley barracker, and a cheerful
little scrap ensued in full view of the respectable
fond mothers and proud fathers. #
The Parramatta-Sydney amateur road
race on Saturday, through clouds of choking dust,
cold winds and vast deserts of blue metal, was a
hideous affair for the riders, and was almost a re-
petition of last year’s event. In the 1912 race M.
E Burke took the first prize, and W. Corben the
prize for fastest time. In this year’s contest the
profits fled into the same pantries. Corben s time
this year, accelerated by the rear-wind, was 1 hr.,
25min., 35sec. —which knocked over two minutes
from the record put up by Andrew Sime.

As the result of digging out 60 brethren
with £5 each, N.S.W. Amateur Athletic Association
has joined with the Maoriland body in the spec, of
bringing along a team of Yankee athletes. One
half of the guaranteed £3OO will be disbursed in ex-
penses for the coming Yanks, while the other half
will be devoted to financing the N.S.W. Amateur
Championships meeting of 15 events, to be held
while the Yankees are with us. So, provided the
Victorian body will ante up a £l5O guarantee, the
Amurkan tour will take place. If Victoria falls
down dead in the effort, so will the tour.

Please charge the glasses and drink the
health of referee Marre, of Brisbane Stadium. Marre
is a reformer, and has started in the good work of
suppressing the palming evil in boxing contests. The
practice of using the heel of the palm for walloping
with has become almost general among boxers
of late, and though referees have issued warnings on
the subject, brother Marre is the first to deal with it
properlv. On Saturday night last he disqualified Pri-
vate Palmer, of Brisbane, for persisting in the evil
course after being warned.

The Mehegan-Wells fight filled Sydney
Stadium to overflowing on Saturday night, but did
not supply the enthralling struggle that was ex-
pected. The long-looked-for contest was a dis-
appointment, and distinctly devoid of excitement.
It was really a duel between a Hebrew racehorse and
an Australian land-crab of equal size. If the crab
could only get the horse where he wanted the steed,
the rest would be silence, save for the voice of the
referee counting 10. But the crab was too slow, and
when the horse wasn’t galloping wildly backwards
or sideways for safety, it was hugging the crab with
its forelegs and hanging on like the Devil. From
the very start it was obvious that Mehegan was the
stronger man and the harder hitter, and the ques-
tion was not who could win the fight, but how
Mehegan could catch the other fellow and get a
chance to fight. He was the aggressive party to the
disturbance all the time, and so much the superior
fighting animal (not boxer) that in a bang to a finish
he must surely triumph. No one realised it better
than Wells, and he adapted his tactics accordingly.
The beginning of his confession of faith read after
the first round was: “The chief end of man (that’s
me) is to keep his vulnerable end out of reach of
Mehegan’s salary hook.” Only three times did he
appear as the offensive partner—once when he was
rushing for a clinch and smote Mehegan on the ear
as he came in, crashed into the Australian and bore
him to the floor —but with innate courtesy dragged
him to his feet again immediately ; once, in the 7th
round, when, after landing on Mehegan's jaw with a
most remarkable right overhand wallop, he sought
to follow up the blow ; and finally in the 14th, when
he astonished Mehegan and the house by charging the
Australian into a corner and raining a shower of
lefts and rights with bewildering speed. Most of
the blows landed on Mehegan's forearms and gloves.
Several dropped on his face, but they made no im-
pression and left no mark. At last the slow, deliber-
ate Mehegan put one fist into action and punched
Wells off. But for the rest of the fight Mehegan
wandered round the ring, vainly trying to get within
range, and shooting blows that missed by about a
yard owing to the way the elusive Londoner tip-
toed gracefully away into safety.
When Lord Curzon was telling King Ned
about the tiger hunt, the King remarked: “Cut out
the sunlight glinting through the trees—did you
blow his blessed head off?” “Who won the fight?”
has been the question universally inquired. Honestly,
this writer doesn’t know. His impression is they
both lost it—one because he was too slow and the
other because he was too quick. The speed that
Wells showed in his backward galloping was de-
scribed by Baker as marvellous ring-generalship. It
rnay have been, but it wasn’t fighting; and most
people went there to see a fight and not a race.
Wells’s mad passion for a safe distance reduced the
scrap to a scrambling business, in which the only
hitting took place in and immediately before the
clinches; and that sort of fight is a dreary proposi-
tion. At in-fighting Wells had no show, although he
showed wonderful skill in blocking the vicious upper-
cuts that Mehegan jerked in quickly and ferociously.
But his performance was absolutely defensive; and,
apparently, because Mehegan made all the attack and
failed to make a success of his attack, and because
Wells, by rear-galloping and quick clinching, made
a success of avoiding a knock-out, and therefore
made good his defence, Wells won. Which means
that the only hope Mehegan had of beating Wells
was to knock him out, while Wells wasn't required to
knock Mehegan out. As boxers, there is no com-
parison between them. Wells is the finished article.
Mehegan isn’t a boxer at all —he’s a fighter, and,
apparently, a fighter can only beat a boxer by outing
him. This writer does not dispute Baker’s decision.
He was referee, and the referee must adopt some ideal
of how the fight should be fought before it begins.
And, anyhow, the referee is fate. Had the writer
been referee he would have given Mehegan the
verdict. Mehegan was never in danger, and Wells
was never out of it. Wells received the more pun-
ishment, and simply dared not stand up to his
opponent, who begged of him to come up and have
a real struggle. The most exasperating thing in the
scrimmage was the amazing slowness of Mehegan.
If he could have put on a spurt and kept up with
Wells, history had told another tale.
It was the easiest fight in the world to control.
Both boys were as cool as cucumbers, and after the
referee spoke obeyed at once. There was no sugges-
tion of hitting on either side once the voice of Baker
breathed over the arena. Wells has a mat of shaggy
black hair over his arms, breast, back, shoulders
and legs. He would be a perfect boon to a kilted
regiment. His nose bled throughout the disturbance,
but his face was not the least bit cut about. He
will never be an attractive spectacle fighting with
Mehegan, but with Holberg, the Dane, or our own
Herbert McCoy, he should be exceedingly good to
watch. Never was a man lighter on his feet or
quicker in his movements. Mehegan’s slowness is
a national misfortune; and he should set about
acquiring speed at once. Baker’s decision received
the endorsement of the bulk of the press, but was
hotly disputed by a large number of regular nng-
siders It was one of those affairs in which splendid
argument could be advanced for giving either side
the victory—all a matter of taste, in fact. But one
thing is certain, judging from the remarks heard
afterwards in trams, trains and boats —and that is,
that if Baker is wise he will referee no more fights
in his own Stadium. His popularity will suffer if he
does ; and just now it is a big asset to him. Public
interest is now turning rapidly towards the impend-
ing battle between Wells and Owen Moran, the date
of which, however, has not yet been fixed.
It is said that Wells was so delighted
with his victory that at the first opportunity he threw
his arms around the neck of the unemotional
Mehegan and kissed him. Ye gods! A photo, oi
Hughie’s face immediately after the osculation should
have been worth £lO. Wells is reported to have said
to a newspaper man, “It was my speed that beat
him!” Certainly his speed got him out of an awtui
lot of trouble, but it had as much to do with winning
the battle as the speed of the flying Jewish stock-
brokers of Johannesburg had to do with winning tn
late S’African war.

The Old Soldier: Where do these parsons
get their facts? Here is what Rev. A. W.
Brough, a missionary newly arrived from
India, told a Maitland (N.S.W.) audience
the other night:—
Fifty years ago there were no railways in India...
Fifty years ago there were no macadamised roads... .
Fifty years ago famine swept off the people by thou-
sands, and tens of thousands perished through great
droughts. Britain’s irrigation works had protected
65,000 square miles from drought.
In 1803, which is just 50 years ago,
the C.I.P. Railway was open from
Calcutta to Aligurh, except for the
break at Allahabad, where the great
bridge across the Jumna was un-
finished. That is to say, India had more
than 950 miles of railway in this portion
alone. On the west, Bombay was connected,
over the Bhore Ghaut, with Buna and
Baroda, and the line was being pushed on
into Central India. The Eastern Bengal
Kailway was also open to the Ganges cross-
ing—a matter of 200 miles. As regards
roads, the Grand Trunk Road, metalled,
and with the sides planted with fruit and
shade trees, was finished for more than
1000 miles from Calcutta to Rurki in the
early ’4o’s —say 70 years ago. The
65,000 square miles which are alleged to
be protected from drought are served by
two canals, the Ganges and Eastern Jumna,
which were begun in the ’3o’s of
the last century. In 1861-2 they had been
working for nearly 10 years. And yet there
was famine in the country that they served.

Our Oath.
Instead of a Bill to abo'ish the old ab-
surdity of oath-taking, a measure to sub-
stitute the Scawtish oath for the English
oath has been submitted to the Vic. Assembly
by members Mackey and Baird. They
propose to put the oath into a kilt, as it
were.
The person taking the oath shall hold the New
Testament, or, in the case of a Jew, the Old Testa-
ment, in his uplifted hand, and shall say or repeat
after the officer administering the oath: “I swear by
Almighty God," etc., etc.
If the person be a Mohammedan, Buddhist,
Confucian or any other sort of disbeliever
in both the Testaments aforesaid, he will,
presumably, swear in his own particular
way without regard for the alteration in the
Act. Also he will continue to be a liar or
otherwise, in common with all Gentiles or
Jews, according to how he feels about the
matter in. hand. What is the value of any
sort of oath imposed upon a witness in a
law case: Truth may be obtained from
many people by putting them on their honor,
or on their fear of being prosecuted for per-
jury if the\ tell lies, but the putting of
peonle on their religious belief in the sanc-
tity of an oath is a shocking waste of mum-
mery where the great irreligious majority is
concerned. Moreover, the people who think
they superstitiously attach sanctity to an
oath administered by a policeman or court
official, are mostly thinking a vain thing.
Perjured snufflebusters are at least as com-
mon as untruthful atheists, if not much
more so. What purpose, save the main-
tenance of an ancient fraud, is served by
swearing witnesses? To ask a man whether
lie understands the meaning of an oath is to
insult his intelligence, if he has any. But
to remind him, as he stands in the witness-
box, that he is in a place where he is ex-
pected to speak the truth, and where the
speaking of untruths lays him open to the
risk of being punished for perjury, is to
appeal to his reason. Which is all that the
Law cam forcibly appeal to. Useless to ap-
peal to the sense of honor or the super-
stitious fears of people who are neither hon-
orable nor fearful df hell fire—who tell lies
as readily and unconcernedly as they blas-
pheme—whose word in business dealings is
not worth the proverbial tinker’s curse. Yet
it is for them, and for the women who never
seem to know the difference between truth
and falsehood, that the legal form of oath is
supposed to be efficacious. Good citizens,
who tell the truth as a matter of course
where serious issues are at stake, don’t need
the solemn, sacred, blessed Bible oath. Bad
citizens don’t care a straw about it, whether
it be English, Scottish, Irish, Jewish or
Chowish.
The Hopeless Australian Sailor.
As recently as a couple of years ago,. when
that big section of Liberalism which is
chronically opposed to any new thing, was
fighting the local navy project with both
hands, all its teeth, and any other weapons
it could find, the argument was advanced
that Australians could never be turned into
seamen. We might buy. the shins, according
to these apostles of national self-abasement,
but we would only find the men to man them
efficiently by going to England. Then a
wholly Australian crew, under an Austra-
lian-born commander, gained the gunnery
championship of the fleet in these waters.
Incidentally, the same men won the highest
praise from the British authorities here for
their smartness and good conduct at sea.
The advocates of a hired navy fell back on
the contention that the competent Australian
mariner, or, for that matter, any other sort
of Australian mariner, was such a rarity
as to be hardly worth considering. Followed
the news that A.B.’s, identical in type with
those who had turned out so well previ-
ously, were being recruited in Australia as
fast as the naval people could wish. As a
final howl, our boys of the Pugdog Breed
claimed hopefully that, however good the
ordinary seamen might be at their job, and
however freely they offered, the locally-born
and trained officers would be absolutely
bound to fail. And now an expert, in the
person of Captain Chambers, the head of
the local Naval College, has come out with
the following concerning the lads under his
charge:—
I have no doubt at all about their futures. I do
not desire to train better material. They all
possessed a good education when they came to the
college, and to this has been added mathematics,
engineering, our chief subjects, physics, French, Eng-
lish literature, and seamanship. I have been asked
to compare -these lads with those I have had to deal
with in an English naval college, and on ships, and
am glad to be able to say that they are quite the
equal of British lads, and perhaps a bit superior.
Yet tfie local anti-Australian, whose custom
it is to pose as an Imperialist, will still
cling fondly to his doubts about the futures
of these youths. He will also assure him-
self hopefully that the supply of A.B.’s must
begin to fail as soon as the men discover
what a hopeless and discreditable service
the Australian navy is; and he will cheer
himself with the thought that, in any case,
as time goes on. the inherent lawlessness
and futility of his fellow-countrymen must
appear, with the result that the whole Navy
scheme will peter out in an atmosphere of
shame and repentance. 1 jacking consolatory
reflections of this sort, the existence of the
indigenous anti-Defence patriot would be
unendurable just now.

“A Meek Umbrella-bearer” : The aims and
objects of the Peace Society are absurd and
impossible. I realise that every time<
I gain the confidence of some fellow-sub-
urbanite and he tells me the story of how
he threatened to thrash the newsagent, or
punch the butcher, or throw the postman
over the fence. One mild-mannered man
solemnly told me, the other night, how he
placed the palm of his large hand over the
rage-distorted countenance of our Italian
greengrocer, and, in that manner, calmly
pushed him the length of the shop past nine
varieties of vegetables. When I asked him
why the greengrocer didn’t bite his hand,
he looked at me as if he considered I was
casting doubt on his battle saga. Another
neighbor, who recently had his house burgled
and couldn’t obtain a policeman with suffi-
cient rapidity, tells how he later rang up
the station and asked with biting sarcasm
what was the best place to apply to when
he wanted a constable. When the footsore
Hop at the other end of the wire showed
some annoyance at being asked foolish
questions the bitter householder Sternly
warned him not to be offensive, or he would
have the jacket _ taken off him, his stripes
removed, and his helmet trampled . on by
the official elephant. Only last night, a
man, who, according to his own account,
has threatened to flog hundreds, was sitting

“0.K.” (who is old enough to know
better) writes: — •
Now that the small-pox scare is abating, may I
be permitted to maunder some of my personal re-
miniscences as a “contact” long ago, when the
scourge was more dreaded in England than it is to-
day. My parental home was situated at the foot of
?o g the ate sm”n pox° n ho°spitaT at "Hampstead, 6 which™ is
beyond Highgate. So it quite often happened that
in my youthful walks up the hill the poor people
who were seeking the hospital aforesaid, with a
patient in charge, would hail me from cab windows,
or afoot, and ask me to ponh: out the cut
to the isolated institution where the patient was to
be placed. Thus I became familiar with the spotted
faces of small-poxed people. Once in a way a
woman carrying in her arms a baby wrapped in a
woollen shawl would ask direction to the hospital
and pull back the wrap from the child’s face to
show me how badly the little sufferer had got it.
When I mentioned these incidents to my people at
home they would bid me be wary of contagion, but
they never disinfected me or rushed me into quaran-
tine. In point of fact, there was no quarantining for
small-pox. So much for my experiences out of
doors. Now for a page of domestic history. As a
boy of 10 I slept in the same room as a brother,
seven years older, who had complained of headache
and sick-feeling overnight. In the morning he called
me from my little bed to come and see the funny
spots on his chest, forehead and thereabouts. I pu t
pnelsles Later Tav inv he
with her young baby and mysel{) wer e y P acked off to
the seaside for a month. My brother had the small-
pox. My father stopped at home and addressed
cheering words to the patient twice a day from be-
hind the half-opened door Two maid servants and
the terrlble cook remained also in the house, which
(I mugt admit) stood in an acre or two of ‘
an( j no dwelling-house within 100 yards
of it. And the patient’s nurse was the resident
nurse-maid, now relieved of the care of the baby,
She was supposed to be immune from contagion be-
caus(r she had “had it.” My brother’s attack of
small-pox was a severe one, but he recovered all
right, and was sent into the country to convalesce
before the absent members of the family (counting
the baby as one, although it couldn’t talk) returned
to the partially disinfected home. The nurse-maid,
the boss “contact,” went on earing for the infant
as before. Myself returned to the room where 1
had fdt the spots to assure myself of their pimpl

“contacts” happened when I was a young clerk in
a warehouse in London. A fellow clerk mentioned
casually that a sister of his had worked herself into
a nervous state as the result of having travelled in
an omnibus with a spotted woman. She persisted
. r assuming that the spots were sma ll- po x, and her
re ] a ti o ns could not laugh her out of her fears. About
a fortnight later my fellow-clerk announced that his
sister had got the disease she was looking for, and
soon afterwards he came to the counting-house with
a black band round his hat. His sister had died. Did
we wori V about his contactitude? Did the disease
gQ any further in his home than it had gone in my
home, 10 years earlier? No. Did his sister's case go
to p rove that a duly vaccinated girl can die easily
enough of small-pox funk ? Yes. Needless to say, I
took no part in the Melbourne rush for calf-lvmph.

Sore Throat and Influenza
THE COMMONEST WINTER COMPLAINTS:
THEIR PREVENTION AND CURE.
When the days are cold and wet in winter, disease
germs have a much greater power over man than
they have in summer. The reason is that chill and
damp lower the vitality and render the body less
liable to withstand the attack of the germs and to
destroy them.
Although Nature has made a wonderful provision
for meeting these germ attacks by delegating to
certain particles of the blood the mission to eat up
these intruders, the warmth and moisture in the
back of the mouth and throat enable the germs to
develop with extraordinary rapidity. Each germ
divides into two in twenty minutes, so that, in the
course of a few hours, a single germ will have pro-
duced hundreds of thousands.
If the body is in a good state of health, the germs
are destroyed very soon after being inhaled, so that
they produce no ill-effects.
When, however; the system is below par or
weakened by any cause, the germs easily overcome
the defending forces in the blood, and we get the
particular disease they produce.
ten minutes they were all killed. In spite of
this, Formamint is not offered as a cure for
diphtheria, although it will undoubtedly prevent
that dread complaint and other serious germ-
diseases.
The Prevention of Diphtheria.
This fact is vouched for by many sanitary
inspectors. The sanitary inspector of High
Wycombe, England, writes : “ I know of no other
preparation so effectual in preventing infectious
disease as Wulfing’s Formamint. During an out-
break of diphtheria I have frequently given away
Formamint to those who have been in contact with
the disease, and no other cases have been removed
to hospital from the same household. Whenever
our ambulance is ordered out for the removal of an
infectious case, Formamint always accompanies
us.”
Many articles have appeared in the medical
papers pointing out Formamint’s supreme excel-
lence in the cure of sore throat. In The Prac-
titioner the Chief Medical Officer of one of the
largest Infectious Diseases’ Hospitals in the world
writes: “ I have never had sore throat myself since
I began to use Wulfing’s Formamint, although I
suffered periodically before.”
A writer in the Lancet states : “ I have had the
best results from the use of Wulfing’s Formamint
Tablets.”
It should be noted, however, that only Wulfing’s
Formamint produces such results. None of the
many imitations now on the market will do so.
How valueless they are is shown by a physician,
who writes that he “ has tried six substitutes, and
has not found one of them efficacious.”
Remarkable Concensus of Opinion.
The social testimony to Formamint’s value is as
remarkable as the medical. No preparation, with
the single exception of Sanatogen, which is made
by the same firm, has received such distinguished
testimonials.
The Right Hon. Viscount Massereene and Ferrard
writes: “I .have found Wulfing’s Formamint most
effective for the cure of sore throat, which quickly
disappears after using a few tablets.”
The Right Hon. Lord Glantawe writes : “ I have
been using Wulfing’s Formamint for sore throat
with most satisfactory results.”
The Right Hon. Lord Kingsale writes: “ I and
my family use quite a number of Wulfing’s
Formamint Tablets, and find them all you say they
are. I always carry a goodly number in my pocket
and have recommended them to many friends.”
As to their value in influenza, Sir George Alex-
ander writes: “Formamint Tablets have been my
constant companions during the winter, and I have
found them a dangerous enemy to the influenza
fiend.”
It is in this way that sore throat,
influenza, and bad colds arise.
Obviously the only means of cure
and prevention is to destroy the
germs in the mouth and throat.
Of all the methods hitherto de-
vised by Science for producing this
result, nothing can compare with
Wulfing’s Formamint. This is
unanimously admitted by the medical
profession.
Many thousands of doctors, in-
cluding several to crowned heads of
Europe, have written to the pro-
prietors stating that they invariably
use Wulfing’s Formamint for treat-
ing sore throat. The reason is that
nothing destroys the germs so rapidly
and completely.
This was first proved by a famous
scientist, who removed some virulent
germs of diphtheria from the throat
of a patient seriously ill with that
disease, and mixed them with a
solution of Formamint. Within

ANTINEURASTHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.

nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address

E.ll. J.: That list of Bulletin con-
tributors who “died young” grows rather wearisome.
Francis Adams wasn’t a scholarly Melbourne writer.
According to his own account he was born in Egypt;
and he was out here a short time seeking health.
Barcroft Boake didn’t die at Mosman; the
geography is all out. Harold Gray wasn’t “the old-
time ‘Giraffe,’ ” and he didn’t die “a sudden and
premature death.” He was ill for a long time be-
fore he passed out. Henry Cargill didn’t “drop
dead from drink in the streets of Brisbane.” He
died indoors, through breakage of a blood-
vessel, while working for a Queensland paper. Any
more questions on hand? Incidentally, what was
the age of the Saviour when He died? It is com-
monly set down at 37 years. Also, what were the
ages, at the time of death, of Josiah, of the infants
who were massacred at Bethlehem, of the child of
the widow of Nain, of Edward V., of England and
of Edward VI. ? Likewise of Little Willie in “East
Lynne” and Eva in “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” ? And
the idea of putting good old Evison among
the alleged early deaths is humorous....
James C.: A great many people can’t bear obscurity,
and if they can’t stand out of the ruck by reason of
special ability they resort to special eccentricity.
This accounts for many prominent atheists, vege-
tarians, nut-eaters, wearers of “rational dress,” Ul-
sterites, Turcophils, advocates of the Beast of Reve-
lation, anti-vaccinationists, Chidleys, and people who
carry a banner inscribed, “Excelsior.’ That is to
say, some people are by nature “rebels in the hills,”
and if there is nothing large to rebel about and no
convenient hills, they have to strike out for them-
selves. We notice, with all due respect, that anti-
vaccination is the hillock or ant-heap you are rebel-
ling on....Junis: You don’t even know enough of
the inkster’s art to use inverted commas where they
are wanted. And the whole thing is the dullest
possible catalogue of how one article went for so
much at the auction, and another for so little, and
one more for next to nothing. If a wild-looking
man suddenly brained the auctioneer with a smite
of furniture because he had stolen the wild-looking
man’s wife 25 years ago, and then shoved his re-
mains inside an eight-day clock, and went off with
the goods under his arm, waving a cruet round his
head to scare off possible pursuers, there might be
some trace of a story in it... . Gal: There is a hor-
rible sameness about the bush priest of the “charac-
ter sketch.” He is always Irish, always generous,
autocratic, short of temper, and a fast driver of
good horses. In short, he is a sort of holy roarer.. .
El Tigre: A rather confused anecdote and wants a
lot of sorting out The Curate: A somewhat
skimpy episode. Of course, we don’t expect every
tale to contain three railway accidents, a murder, a
person unjustly sentenced to penal servitude for life,
a heroine, an adventuress, a forgery, a battle, a
horse-race, a revolution and a whaling expedition
all in one column, but there ,are limitations... .F.
Leslie: Yarn about the seduction of a harmless bush
girl takes the back track. Even our deep and
solid interest in the birth-rate fails at this point... .
Tilga: A needlessly gruesome sort of thing
Haremai: Thanks; see B. 31/7/’l3. .. .Squeezarder :
Very well; send your windpipe next time. ... Pra :
There are some points about it, but they are very
blunt points. In fact, they suggest a stout person’s
knees.... Sosh (or Tosh or something dimly re-
sembling either of them) : Faintly reminiscent of
the “Dolly Dialogues.” There isn’t much meat in
it, and there is very little bone. .. .Will Darling:
The sentiment is fine, but the facts won’t bear in-
spection Persephone: About 600 years ago a
favorite remedy for pessimism and melancholy was
an adder boiled alive with leeks. After reading
your contribution the verdict is that you should try
a boa-constrictor boiled with water melons....M.
Taylor: It is pretty verse, but the supply of verse
about clouds and sunsets and rivers and night and
shadows is so much ahead of the demand.... Manin:
“Vision” is a pretty thing, but very, very 5ma11....
B B.: Afraid we’ll have to pass Miss G G.: Very
sweet, and tender, and unoriginal. .. .H.F.C. : Looked
twice at the pieman and passed on. . . .C.W.H.: The
sight of those personages going to and fro seems to
stir you, but verse isn’t your line. If you have any
honest scorn about you, try to pack it into prose. . . .
G.R.H.: Almost worse than the homily... .Yarg: Six
months without the option.... Lex Brown: Yes, and
this is going to the basket. ...F.M.C.: Not much
taken with Stumpy... .J.R. (Yamba) : Uninteresting
. ...Weka: Not half-way up. ... Yannatherra: Too
cowyardy.... Arthur H.: Very spirited. It threw 15
handsprings and fell out of the office. .Yaral: Why all
this wailing and lamentation?... .F.W.(W.A.) : Well,
you won’t read your own rot ... . K.1.M.: Pardoned
on account of your obvious youth. .. .K.A.H.: Not
badly • done, but it follows an old sugary recipe....
N.L.W.: A pleasant scrap of verse, but it amounts
to nothing very definite. .. .E.V.M.: The meaning
of “Autocrat” is not very clear. Also, even blank
verse may be a shade too blank at times. . . .M. O’R.:
“Ploughing” got out of the furrow of acceptance
and struck hard against the stump of non-publica-
tion. ~ .T.8.R.: A simple trifle. Rather too simple,
in fact, as well as too trifling. . . .Chloe: You have
the poetic instinct, but you don’t take sufficient
trouble with your work. It is a hurried sort of
device to make a line fit its environment by cutting
out “a” or “the” and reducing things to telegraphic
form, as you have done in “Sea Harvest.” You
know quite enough of verse-building to avoid those
methods if you try. Some night when the rest of
the household has gone to bed, throw your hairpins
to the four winds, let your abundant tresses flow
down to your knees, tie a wet towel round your
head, drink a cun of strong coffee, and patch the
verses. . . .E. A. Phipson (England) : Deeply Disre-
spected Sir, —If you keep on writing dreary letters
for another ten vears somebody may draw our atten-
tion to your existence, and if we do become aware
that you are on the face of the earth we may throw
a bit of fluff at you and kill vou. We once knew
an artist who made a success of life by following a
very simple rule. During one-half of his working
hours he nainted nictures. During the other half
he minded his own business. It was during the
second half that he rose to greatness. .. .Kermadec:
Prisoner at the threepenny bar. the sentence of this
Court is that you be irrigated bv the neck until vou
are quite drunk. Judging by your copy, two more
beers will do it. .. .West Coast: According to the
last count there were A. 552.961 people in London
proper, and another 2,730,002 in the “outer ring.”
No statistics available dividing the city into east
and west ends C.F.C.: Send it to the lady your-
self. and she’ll probably tell you she has had lots
worse'fired at her.

Jonathan B.: Declined. It is a poor and struggling
joke Smith: The pictures and the jokes were
equally a disgrace to the great Smith family. Do
you know that Benhadad, King of Syria, bore a
name that was the local equivalent of Smith? There
was, in Norse mythologv, the Smith of the Gods.
Furthermore, the smith’s apron was for many years
the national standard of Persia. And there were
many great and orominent Smiths, including one
Smittowski, of Poland, and Bobby Smith, the Lon-
don banker, whose descendant became Governor of
N.S.W. You are a discredit to a noble race.

TOBACCO
IT is an admitted fact that present tobacco
crops are eminently unsatisfactory, and
manufacturers who are compelled to
purchase at the present time cannot obtain
so good a tobacco as hitherto. It is owing
to this deterioration that many cigarettes
are degenerating in quality.
THE manufacturers of “Winfred”
Ci garettes are in a unique position.
They hold an enormous stock of the
finest selected tobacco purchased during the
past three or four years, so that they are able
to maintain, for some years to come, the
present high-class quality of their cigarettes
without increasing the price.

An Important National Question.
Settlement of
Northern Queensland.
Treasurer of Queensland has recently called tenders for the
1 erectlon of a ] arge, modern, and well-equipped Central Sugar Mill
at Babmda Creek, near Cairns, North Queensland. This will
now give wide opportunities for energetic young cane farmers, and
reliable field workmen, and (later) mill hands in the Sugar Industry.
The Mill is to be ready for crushing in JULY, 1915.
W ith adequate protection (and no industries in Australia are more
entitled to good protection than those natural to the Tropics, and carried
on by European labor) there are many other agricultural opportunities
for farmers and settlers, i.e in Coffee, Tea, Spices, Tropical Fruits,
Arrowroot, etc., etc.

GEORGE J. COHEN, Chairman.
T. A. DIBBS, General Manager.
W. R. SAYERS, Accountant.
We hereby certify that we have examined the bills, compared the balances, and counted the coin
In the Head Office of THE COMMERCIAL BANKING COMPANY OF SYDNEY, LIMITED, and have
compared the returns of the Branches, and have found the same as specified in the foregoing Balance-
W. U DOCKER, , Auditor ,
The following resolutions were carried unanimously: , , a a ,
“That the Report and Statements of Account be received and adopted, and ordered to be circulated
amongthe Thompson Esq be re-elected a Director of the Bank.”
“That E S Caoe Esa and F W. Hixson, Esq., be appointed Auditors for the ensuing year.”
“That the thinks of the Shareholders be presented to the Directors, General Manager, and Officers
of the Bank for their very satisfactory management of the affairs of T A oiBBS. Genera! Manager.
In moving the adoption of the Report, the Chair-
man, Mr. George J. Cohen, said: —
“I am pleased to say that the Directors are again
enabled to prelent to you a satisfactory Balance-
sheet, and though the stringency in the money market
that I referred to at our last meeting has been some-
what intensified, with a consequent restriction in
business, yet I tliink you will agree with me that the
result of our operations for the past half-year is
gratifying. Naturally there has been contraction in
our figures, but without decrease in strength.
“In comparing the figures with those of June last
year I would first mention that by payment of final
instalments our capital paid tip now stands at
£1,750,000, the limit authorised by general meeting.
During the same period the-Reserve Fund has been
increased by £BO,OOO, and if we take into considera-
tion the appropriation recommended to-day it will
stand at £1,630,000.
“Notes in circulation show a reduction of £*B,ooo,
and you will observe that only about £30,000
remain unrepresented.
“During the period under review our deposits have
decreased by £BlO,OOO, which is more than
accounted for by reduced Government balances, and
the withdrawal of Federal Government moneys at toe
beginning of the present year, to the extent together
of over £1,100,000. In connection with this item
I may mention that our Fixed Deposits have in-
creased during the twelve months, while our Current
Accounts, though less in amount for the reasons
•tated, are much larger in number.
“Profit and Loss shows a satisfactory increase of
£24,000, and our total reserved profits will now
stand at £1,687,000.
“These variations cause a net contraction in our
total figures of £657,000.
“Our total Liquid Assets show a reduction of
£275,000, yet notwithstanding this the ratio of
these assets to our total liabilities to the public is
over 47 per cent., practically the same as it was a
year ago.
“Our lendings have been reduced ,by £384,000.
“The last item, Bank Premises Account, shows an
increase of only a little over £ 2000, although we
have expended a considerable sum in land and new
, buildings.
“Realising how greatly the success of the Bank is
dependent on the efficiency of the staff, and desiring
that the officers should feel that their efforts are ap-
preciated, the Board have again voted them a bonus.
In addition, special consideration has been given to
the pay of the staff, and as a result the Board have
fixed upon a tariff of salaries and increases on a
scale more liberal than lias hitherto existed. The
Board feel sure that they have the fullest concurrence
of the shareholders in this. . .
“It is intended to call the proprietors together at
an Extraordinary General Meeting before the end of
the vear to consider the advisableness of increasing
the paid up capital of the bank from £1,760,000 to
£2,000,000, the new shares to be issued at par.
“I have much pleasure in moving that the Report
and Balance-sheet be adopted, and that they be
printed and circulated among the proprietors.

“Booshee”: Mention of Docy Stewart and the
death of her third husband (B. 31/7/’l3), brings to
my mind her tirst, Jim Collins. When Docy Stewart
married him she retired from the stage, but soon
returned and made a very welcome reappearance at
the opening of the new lioyal in Melbourne on Cup
night, 1872. An opening address was written for
the occasion by Dr. Neild, dramatic critic for The
Australasian, and Docy Stewart read it. She re-
mained at the Royal for some years, doing excellent
work as actress and vocalist, but left in 1877 to
start on a tour of the world in companw with
Maggie and Nellie and dad in “Rainbow Revels,”
a drawing-room entertainment written for the family
by Garnet Walsh. In the ’Bo’s Jim Collins died,
and a year or so afterwards his widow married actor-
manager H. R. Harwood. Harwood was then very
well-to-do; but the bank smashes of ’93 blew him
out, and within a year or two he died —threw up
the ghost. Then Docy Stewart married Chamboisier,
later on of the Savoy. But that end of her eventful
life has been written *t>f by men whose thatch is
thicker than mine.
A glimpse into the profits of the leasing side of
the moving-picture business was lately given by
John Payne, in the M.L. House of Reps. There had
been a howl in favor of the Anti-Socialistic farmers
being provided .with Socialistic manures. Payne
perpendicularised himself, with a suggestion that
the Government should take over the control of film
importation and distribution in M.L. This, he
said, would ensure some educational films, while
supplying from £70,000 to £BO,OOO a year to buy
fertiliser with. As Payne is in the picture business
himself, his estimate as to a local picture-combine’s
profits may be taken as fairly reliable or else
wildly sarcastic.
“Lud”: What a gasp of astonishment among the
actresses in court when it was announced that the
Marquis of Northampton had agreed to give
£50,000 damages to Daisy Markham! She’s a
little widdy of a sort, having divorced Harold Moss,
a stockbroker’s clerk, in 1906. She is 27, and has
been nine years on the stage. In court she was pale
and agitated (of .course). Under her black satin
coat was a white silk blouse, open at the
neck. A pink rosebud blushed on the lapel of the
coat. Her big black hat was trimmed with chiffon,
fastened in front with a large jet brooch.
These things I mention as being possible aids to
other damsels in distress. A-t. any rate, no other
actress has been able to score so well. Miss For-
tescue got £lO,OOO from Lord Garmoyle. Phyllis
Broughton’s little lot from Dangan/ now Cowley,
was £sooo—the same as Birdie Sutherland got
from Marjoribanks, afterwards Tweedmouth. True,
Northampton’s income is £150,000, and a gentleman
with £150,000 a year ought to be specially careful
how he plucks his Daisies.
“Quo”: Something went hideously wrong with
the works in the S. M. Herald office the other day,
with the result that the notice of “The Dancing
Mistress” contained some cold truths. The piece
was “machine-made,” it had “not a gleam of orig-
inality,” the humor was “pumped,” “the tedious
rubbish” of the comedian “would make a panto-
mimist blush,” the co. nothing with the
“barren nonsense,” and, generally, everybody con-
cerned was “ill-used by composer and librettist.”
How rare is frank comment of that sort in the
Australian daily press, and how much better for
the public if there were more of it! The tragedy is
that we get it but once in five years or so.
“0.K.”: Nordica, in “the sere, the yellow leaf,” re-
minds one somewhat of the Albani who made her first
appearance in Australia many years ago, under Wil-
liamson’s management—not the Albani of the second
visit, whose singing and platform frivols had de-
generated into a joke. Nordica is still capable of
suggesting her former greatness. Her high notes
have a smoothness and a quality of tone which dis-
tinguish the top-notch voices, artistically produced,
from the best of the second-class voices. Her trill
is still reminiscent of its prime. And in all her
work there is the air of the prima donna who has
done famous things, which air, indeed, was more
pronounced in the more florid warbling of Albani
many years ago. Nordica's surviving notes are very
faded (the others are practically gone), but the
perfume of their past clings to them. Her person-
ality is winsome. It has very little of the magnetism
of a OalvS, but in conjunction with her own indi-
vidual style of dramatic expression in singing, the
charming personality counts for a good deal. Her
name having been associated with grand opera only,
and particularly with Wagnerian opera, is no attrac-
tion to the multitude that remains ignorant of the
affairs of the operatic world, but to those who have
long known her by reputation, the appearance of Nor-
dica is interesting and satisfactory. The famous
artist is a has-been. But then, she makes it clear
that she is a has-been, and not a never-was, whereas
Albani, on her second visit, offered no vestige of evi-
dence that she had once commanded a fee of, say,
£2OO or £3OO for starring at a concert.
Hard times for the drama,” says a heading in
London Daily Mail. “Seven plays fail in eight
black weeks.” The seven were “Strife,” “The Seven
Sisters,” “Yours,” “The Duchess’s Necklace,” “Pan-
thea,” “The Cardinal’s Romance” and “The Perfect
Cure.” Various causes are assigned. Some critics
even go to the length of saying that the plays are
no good.
From London: Harcourt Beatty is in the
cast of “The Barrier,” to be produced at
the Strand, where “The Glad Eye” recently
ceased from protracted winking. Matthew
Lang also has a part in this piece, which tells the
story of an American officer who falls in love with a
beauteous half-breed in Alaska, and strikes almost
as many complications as the case demands.
When “The Marriage Market,” George Edwardes’s
latest musical comedy success, comes to Sydney, Arch-
bishop Kelly will have to make another public pro-
test. The scene is in Western America, and in a
place called Medicino Bluff, in Southern California,
an annual marriage market is held among the cow-
boys. Thither resort all the pretty calf girls from
far and wide, and they are playfully knocked down
to the highest bidders, and afterwards spliced in
mock matrimony by a surpliced cowboy. But this
time the surpliced cowboy happens to be a real
R.C. priest, and the supposed mock marriages are
the real goods. Hence arise all sorts of complica-
tions, dances and ditties.
“Vic.”: Berry and Anderson, the Ballarat printers,
have just discovered a playbill for the opening of
the, local Theatre, RoyaLin 1858, under the manage-
ment of W. Hoskins, who had been Irving’s tutor.
The programme includes Jerrold’s comedy of “Time
Works Wonders” and the farce “Deeds of Dreadful
Note.” Hoskins had a Ballarat brother, H. H. Hos-
kins, a solicitor; owner of Nimblefoot, the Melbourne
Cup winner. The Theatre Royal was afterwards in-
corporated in Snow’s drapery emporium. Former
theatres at Ballarat were the Montezuma and Charlie
Napier. Favorites at these were Kate O’Reilly, Kate
Warde, Greville, Con Warde, Bob Dale and Stuart
O’Brien. The dramas which most obtained favor
were such as “The Green Bushes,” “Flowers of the
Forest,” and “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” with an infusion
of old-fashioned tragedies, such as “Jane Shore,” in
which Con Warde used to rage. Little -Toe Dias,
Tong afterwards known in Melbourne as Josh Hea-
wood’s crony, was a favorite low comedian. Hoskins
raised the Ballarat standard, with productions like
Shakspeare’s “Tempest.”
“Circle”: There is one thoroughly unreal touch in
“The Butterfly on the Wheel.” When foolish little
Peggy realises how siispicious her shallow friends
are after the unfortunate evening with the co-re.,
she delivers a carefullv-written, involved and wholly
“literarv” speech to the effect that she is a little
fool; but, unlike the hired fool, does not possess a
cap and bells costume—and so’ on for several beauti-
ful, well-marshalled lines. I can’t remember how it
goes exactly, but it must look very nice printed.
Yet it is utterly useless. No butterfly Peggy could
talk such stuff, and as for getting impatient” Smart-
Setters to listen to it !
Ethel Dane, Australian actress, and wife* of Aus-
tralian actor Cyril Keightlev, has discovered a new
form of the gentle art of advt. She has made a pet
of a two-year-old bear, and London papers have

with her little bruin,

THE Drinks You Serve Turn Quickly
into Big Profits, but You Must Get a
“NELSON” Brand of Soda Fountain!
Do not hesitate about this business —it demands your immediate attention.
The hot weather is not far distant, and, if you are a retailer, you ought to get
in” before your competitor. Storekeepers, chemists, hotelkeepers, refieshment-
room proprietors, and others all over Australia are praising “Nelson” Foun-
tains.
“Nelson” Machines are made for permanent satisfaction. They are made
to last—not to “sell.” We could spend more money on “show” and less on the
vital inside parts that count—but we don’t. Our reputation is too highly
valued to lisk it. Small, unknown firms might do so, but we can’t.
We could put galvanised iron (like other firms) inside our machines, but
we put solid copper instead. We could put more paint and varnish on the
outside, but it has no material bearing on the working and durability of the
machines—so we don’t. There are dozens of ways we could mislead buyers
(temporarily), but we don’t and we won’t.
QUALITY is the very foundation of our business and you’ll find it
mighty good policy to do business with us.
If you are ambitious as a business man, and want to push your business
for all it is worth —if you want to make the greatest possible profit—just drop
us a note. We’ll give you the benefit of our 20 years’ experience for nothing.

IN BANANA LAND
As a result of a commotion made by Kir-
svan and Adamson, M’s.L.A., the Denham
Government has decided to delete No. 18
from the Queensland Traffic Regulations.
This obnoxious rule of the railway service
deprived employees of the right to wag their
longues as citizens. Under it all they might
do politically was to record a silent vote on
polling day. Twice previously the Assembly
had carried resolutions for guillotining Reg.
18, but the Government took no notice. Con-
stant dripping has worn away the Tory
stone, and it will stand no longer in the
way of Mr. Shunter saying what he thinks
about Denham and Paget—or Denham and
Paget’s opponents, who may be equally in
need of some plain English some day.
"Rangan”: Something has gone wrong,
and the Mac Keen petrol cars, which the
Queensland Railway Department imported
from America for suburban traffic have not
been put on the lines yet. What’s wrong
with the steam Purrey cars now running in
Rockhampton? They have been working
perfectly for two years now, and can be
made locally (Rockhampton makes its own).
With a trailer they cost £l5OO. and carry 80,
while a Mac Keen car costs £4500 and carries
70. With the facilities at the Ipswich rail-
way works, something like four Purrey cars
could be turned out for the cost of one Mac-
Keen ; and the Purrey cars have now been
proved under local conditions, while the
others haven’t been.
“Rangan” : If you have a “double” in this
world, pray that he may break his neck.
One Alexander Butcher, of Rockhampton,
had a “double” in Alexander Anderson. They
were so much alike that you could not tell
the other from the first one. Anderson was
human and frail, and Butcher, being a casual
Australian, did not pray that Providence
would break his wicked neck. So it hap-
pened that when Anderson had loved a lass, ,
not wisely but too well, and shortly found it
convenient to drop south, leaving tangible
evidence of his affections, it was Butcher who
one day received notice from the lass to pay
up. Of course he refused. Later, before
a bewildered P.M., four people swore that
Butcher was Anderson, and four more swore
that Butcher was not Anderson, nor Ander-
son Butcher. After 16 gasps the P.M. man-
aged to say that he was quite convinced that
Butcher was Butcher, and Anderson was
Anderson, and that it was Anderson whom
the infant should make goo-goo noises to.
Now the enlightened Butcher prays that the
unrighteous Anderson may break "that which
keeps his head joined to his body, but he sees
that he ought to have sent up his supplica-
tions long ago.
“Phil F.”: If the teetotal principles of
Young Bros., of Fairymead (B. 31/7/T3),
impelled them to run their molasses into the
Burnett instead of selling them for the manu-
facture of rum, the sacrifice did not prevent
the spread of drunkenness. I remember see-
ing fish which had been “nipping” at the
molasses pipe floating about on the surface
of the Burnett hopelessly inebriated, to the
joy of small boys who used to row out and
pick up the goods before they had time to
sober again. After a few weeks, however,
the boozers grew canny, avoided the molasses
overflow, and took to strenuous teetotalism.
“Caber” : Ken Grant, one of the few men
who have left the Labor party and still re-
main in the Bananaland Assembly, finds
himself in a tight corner just now. In the
days when Grant was a “red-ragger” he
yelled lustily for separation, and on this
ticket Rockhampton stood him up and
blessed him. His old colleague, ex-parson
Adamson, tabled a motion in the Assembly
the other night for the subdivision of
Queensland info three separate States, and
Grant’s hour of tribulation arrived. To
support the resolution would be to go back
on the Denham crowd; to vote against it
would mean that his name would be spelled
M-u-d in Rockhampton. The only excuse he
could fashion was that this was merely
another trick of the Labor party’s, and so
he would vote against it. Which settles
Kenneth McDonald Grant.
THE RADIANCE OF
A NOSE.
JUDGE (to cotinsel, -who has some difficulty in reading a document): “Do yon want more
light , Mr. Hair-Splitter ?”
OPPOSING COUNSEL (with very red nose): “Yes, your Honor; he does, very badly.”
COUNSEL FOR DEFENCE (to Judge): “Thank you, your Honor, I do want more light;
but I wish you to understand that I object to any reflection from my friend on
the right being cast upon me."
Again the Northern degenerate! Martin
Gorman, an ancient Hughenden identity of
70 years, got lost in the Flinders country
the other day and wandered around exposed
to the dreadful climate of those parts for
seven days. When picked up by a search
party the old fellow was little the worse, and
made no particular pother about his suffer-
ings. Trifles of that kind didn’t worry him.
Toowoomba is asking itself if it had not
better shift camp. It had been so busy
over the small-pox scare that it quite over-
looked a case of leprosy in the heart of the
city. In spite of occasional official secrecy,
the number of cases of the foul disease that
come to light in Queensland is depressing.
The “cheap” colored labor with which the
North still foolishly flirts carries a terrible
sting in its tail.
Townsville, the uninteresting, has dis-
covered a much-needed sanatorium, Mount
Spec, five or six miles from the railway to
Ingham, and about 40 miles from Bobby
Towns’s town. A party of citizens has
just returned from a week-end trip with
glowing accounts. The place is 3000 ft.
up, there is “scenery to vie with the Blue
Mountains,” no mosquitoes, 20ft. of alluvial
soil, settlers’ cottages with Deaches,
lemons, oranges, grapes and all cold-country
fruits, necessity for blankets winter and
summer, and occasional frosts—a regular
luxury for coastal natives. Townsville is
just about to celebrate its jubilee, and feels
entitled to the Mount Spec sanatorium as a
birthday present. But it will cost £6OOO to
turn the place into a get-at-able resort;
and alas ! “Bob” Philp is no longer Premier.
The Kicking of the ’Roo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Cook Government has ukased that the kan-
garoo must depart from the postage stamp.
The people clamored for reform
In fashion clear and strong,
And language rose a trifle warm
When Joseph dallied long;
A score of things cried out, “We need
A man who’d dare and do!”
Said Joseph in decided tones —-
“Kick out the Kangaroo!”
The tariff wants up-building high,
The imports keeping down ;
The Asian eats Exclusion Fie
With dark and angry frown ;
And so our Navy must expand.
Our new-born Army too.
“I know,” said Joe, “the way to go —
Blot off the Kangaroo!”
At Darwun there’s an open gate
That bids the foe come in ;
To leave it so is tempting Fate
And gambling with our skin ;
If naught is done to link us up
Some day the land will rue.
Said Joe, “Decamp from off that stamp.
You wretched Kangaroo!”
The tread of moneyed Ring and Trust
Comes nearer day by day;
And dear will be the worker’s crust
If they should have their way.
How shall we block their little game
And spoil the broth they brew?
Said Joe, “Ho-ho! The trick I know—
Just shift that Kangaroo!”
And when he leaves his little stage
The books will tell with pride:
“He rushed around in noble rage
And Heav’n and earth defied.
He tinkered not with tariff rates;
No alien Trust he slew ;
With warlike boot this valiant coot
He biffed the Kangaroo!”
QUEENSLAND.
PHILO ROO.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, August 9, 1913.
My Dear Thabgomindah,—
The Chiel and Lady Macgregor, Captain
Silver and his aristocratic-looking grey-
haired wife, an assortment of officers in
colored duds, and a lot of mere clay watched
some 4000 cadets march past the square
of garden between the Lands Office and the
Police Commissioner’s Office this afternoon.
The lads swung along splendidly, with rifle
on shoulder, and, though some had been en-
rolled only a month, they looked quite
smart. Amongst the civilian onlookers were
Arthur Morgan and Pinlayson and Huxham,
M’s.L.A. P remier Denham was engaged
elsewhere, opening a f@te or something else
with a vote oF’two tied to its tail.
On Friday afternoon the Macgregor pre-
sided at the annual meeting of the Society
for the Hindrance of Brutality.
The Stricklands are expected here on
Monday. Lady Edeline and the Governor
will camp at Government House, and Miss
Strickland will shelter under J. H. McCon-
nel’s roof at East Brisbane.
The event of the week was the Hilma
Ohman-Harry Mills wedding. The little
bride looked smaller than ever by the side
of her 6ft. 2in. Englishman. Her dress was
of white satin covered with wonderful old
lacfe, which had belonged to the bridegroom’s
mother. There were six bridesmaids, and
the female part of the audience gave a gasp
of envy when it saw their frocks. Mollie
Brenan, Marjorie Green (the handsome
Maorilander who has been staying with
Mrs. Arthur Feez for so long), and Leila
and Myee Feez were all tricked out in white
net over satin, with sashes of floral ninon.
Each dress was made differently, and the
hats, of ninon to match their sashes, were
likewise dissimilar and heterogeneous. The
maids carried great armfuls of pink roses.
Mrs. Ned Tully’s little daughter and the
Haymen child brought the number up to
six. Their frocks were white muslin over
pink silk, and they, too, were laden with
roses. Archbishop Donaldson read the ser-
vice in a properly-dejected voice, and
George Sampson Jack-Johnsoned the organ.
The groom gave his bride a pair of pearl
and diamond ear-rings, and a team of
ponies. He has been driving the ponies—
hve of them —up and down Queen-street
for the last week, rather to the dislocation
of the traffic.
The wedding was one of the best-dressed
items of the winter. Mrs. Blundell (who is
the brides mother—P. A. Blundell, of the
Queensland Trustees, is her step-father)
looked as pretty as ever. She is a daughter
of Tom King, once Commissioner of Rail-
ways, and comes of a good-looking family.
The air is laden with piebald mutterings
anent the Y.W.C.A. It is alleged that three
young women who came up from the South
had the door of that eminently respectable
and charitable establishment shut in Hi •
faces, and that the carter who was in
of their luggage (a mere Philistine who dirt
not belong to any religious society) w,
them not to faint by the wayside, but
them to some decent place where theyobta S
tood and safe shelter. A Brisbane womaS
who was in Sydney last year also alle,*.
that the Y.W.C.A. there refused to open fh
door to some country girls whose train wa«
late, and who therefore did not arrive
at the holy hostelry until after the uneortiv
hour of 11 p.m. The girls went back J
Redfern station and spent the night there
in the waiting-room. Incidentally I SPP
Thargomindah, that the Holy Children in
Sydney are howling at the Government to
do something to checkmate the White
Slaver.
The captain and officers of the Australian
war-boat Melbourne brushed their hair
shone up the brass wdrk, and gave an At
Home yesterday on board. The Melbourne’s
decks are to be cleared for action again
next Thursday, when a chosen few will
bunny hug and grizzly bear among the guns.
Cassidy, Rhodes scholar for 1913, ■•was
farewelled at a river trip on the old bob-
tailed tub Lucinda on Monday afternoon
Most of the University staff arid all of the
students turned up to say good-bye to him
for he is a very popular young hopeful. On
Tuesday evening a farewell dinner was
eaten in his honor, likewise his presence.
G. S. Hutton, a well-known business man
and a leading light among Masons (the
ones that wear aprons so that the cham-
pagne won’t stain their dress pants), died
early on Monday morning. He had been ill
for some time, suffering from a complication
of liver and kidney disorders. For some
years he was a member of the committee for
the General Hospital, and that institution
profitably borrowed largely of his business
experience.
The Amateur Dramatic Co. is to-night
wrestling with German’s comic-opera,
“Merrie England,” with George Webster!
emerged from seclusion, once more playing
the comedian’s part. Lottie Richter, who
is a better singer than she is an actress,
and Mrs. E. R. B. Jordan, who is surpris-
ingly good at stage work, are also included
in the cast. Over 70 people are helping the
show to take the money at the door without
feeling too bad about it.
Brisbane will be stone broke when show
week is over. King’s dramatic co. is putting
on three popular bellowdramas during the
week. “The Count of Luxembourg” will
get out on Tuesday in favor of “Autumn
Manoeuvres,” Branscombe has two shows of
Dandies going for the next fortnight, and
the pictures we have always with us.
Wirths’ circus, also, is here. This hamlet
is certainly going the pace.
Another feed was given to the social
unemployed by Mrs. Billy Ahles, for Amy
Papi, who is going to marry one Minnett at
some future date (exact time unknown).
The tea was a linen one, and when the 65th
guest had deposited a bundle on the intend-
ing matrimonial victiih’s lap it looked as
though a laundry had broken its stay-laces.
Catherine Laing, who is going to convert
—or as near to it as she can get—-yellow
brothers from their heathenism, was enthu-
siastically farewelled at St. Andrew’s
Church on Wednesday night. The Governor
presided, and various gentlemen with their
clothes buttoned up behind mentioned what
a glorious thing it was for Catherine. I’d
sooner get Catherine’s unbiased opinion in
a year or' two.
The annual ball of the Yacht Club hap-
pened on Tuesday. Captain alad Mrs. Silver
came along, and brought al collection of
officers- with them. It was a .cheerful heel-
shuffle, and if anybody asked for the com-
plaint book it wmsn’t done in my hearing.
Other leaps were managed iby the Old
Girls of the 8.G.5., by the Liberal Young
Women (Digby Denham supplied the chin
music), by the Golliwogs (who were enter-
taining the Blue Birds) and by the Oxley
Lawn Tennis people. Pretty Mrs. Espie
Dods gave a dance, too, early in the week.
Yours at the terminus,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Digby Denham’s Electoral Reform Bill is
the proposal of a Government utterly panic-
stricken by the Federal elections in Queens-
land. As things simply must be evened up
somehow, the idea is to give Propputy a
shove-along by restoring the oostal vote, and
Labor a set-back by abolishing the so-called
“absentee” vote. Under the latter provision
a man must be two months in an electorate
before he can get a transfer —unless he is a
property owner, in which event he can man-
age it in 24 hours. With almost brutal
frankness the Bill aims at disfranchising
every nomad, and that means wiping out
the whole wool- and wheat-harvesting popu-
lation as voters. Even Government sup-
porters are amazed at the chilled-steel impu-
dence of the proposals : and their one excuse
is that a man may fly to anv port in a
storm.

each car being allowed forty gallons of petrol for the contest, or an average of fourteen miles to the gallon. It
will be easily understood how important a part the tyres would play in a matter of reliability. Last year’s

The Best Saddle in Australia
for the Stockman
£6llO
w*
m
We have been making saddles for close on half a century—-and
all we know about the game has gone into the making of this
famous Stock Saddle of ours. It is hand-made throughout—no
cheap and nasty machine work anywhere. It is built on the
staunchest tree of specially tempered steel, fitted with an
unbreakable gulletplate, to which are riveted (not screwed, mind
you) solid steel hind crupper plates. This makes the tree
absolutely unbreakable, yet gives just the elasticity and “give”
needed. The seat is made of specially tanned bag leather, with
very long, thick harness leather flaps, that do away with the
need of wearing leggings. There are leather points to the panel, that will
not wear out for the whole life of the saddle. The knee pads are 51 inches
high, and made of solid leather, double sewn inside so that they won’t sag
or give over. The thigh pads are made in the same way and If inches
high. We have the seats with as high a dish as 6 inches, but any lower
dish you want we can give you. The mountings are brass and nickel, and
the Dees are fastened so securely that no tug will strain them. The panel
is serge lined, and with extended facings so as not to fray or wear out by
the rubbing of the swag or tucker gear. The saddle is sold fitted with
fold or split leather girths, i bar irons, stirrup leathers, ring or ordinary
crupper and surcingle.
OUR GUARANTEE. —Any number of these saddles of ours sold ten years
ago are in use to-day and practically as good as new. No stauncher saddle
could be made. The one you buy from us we will guarantee for two years.
If within that time the saddle proves faulty in material or workmanship, if
you return it to us, we will give you a new saddle in place of it free of
charge. If a saddle lastt two years it will last as long as it is cared for
—though of course no saddle will stand being rolled on or being bumped
against a tree.

THE
WORKS
OF
De MAUPASSANT.
ELBERT HUBBARD writes:—
“Men of Genius, who have left
the beaten track to discover a
new country, have ever called
down carping criticism. A prac-
tice centuries old, this, when one
cannot understand nor appreciate ;
’tis so satisfying and virtuous to
stand aside and sneer. Or bet-
ter, take the Presumptuous One
and nail him to a gibbet. For
aeons men have fouled their own
tongues by slander; they have
dipped their pwn hands in the
heart’s blood of martyrs; they
have besmirched their own mem-
ory and polluted their times; yet,
all their destructive' madness has
plucked not a single leaf from
the laurel crown of Genius. You
may kill a great and good man.
Oh, yes ! —you may reproach and
revile him; you may call down
imprecations, but when you are
dead and forgotten, his soul, his
memory will go marching on and
on. De Maupassant, of ail
writers, has suffered most from
misunderstanding. He has been
crucified on the brazen cross of
ignorance. This man never wrote
to please the Rabble. He wrote
because he had a message for the
world, and because Divine Energy
forced it through his pen. De
Maupassant wrote with the con-
viction that in life there could be
no phase so noble or so mean, so
honorable or so contemptible, so
lofty or so low as to be unworthy
of chronicling—no groove of
human virtue or fault, success or
failure, wisdom or folly that did
not possess its own peculiar
psychological aspect and there-
fore demanded analysis. If oc-
casionally some intellectual pig-
my, after reading, screams in fal-
setto, please remember spon-
taneity and mediocrity are never
kin.
“A WARNING.—Those of you
who find enjoyment in blue-milk
brain-wanderings should never
seek De Maupassant. You will
be disappointed. You will not be
able to digest nor assimilate the
strong elixir of his mind, so it
will curdle in your gullet—then
it’s you for mental constipation.”

ARE YOU
DEAF?
if you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just hew it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. t .No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them —-the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion cf the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
0
cured, snd you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are onlv
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send' them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

The whole idea of a fountain pen is to
simplify writing. That is why the
Onoto is unrivalled. It fills itself. A
fountain pen that needs a filling appar-
atus defeats its own end ; it is as out-
of-date as a watch that needs a key.
The Onoto Pen is a
triumph of simplicity.
It is complete in itself— perfect in the
simplicity of its mechanism—British manu-
facture and guaranteed by its makers.
All who write should own the
the pen— never leaks.

filing
rs m
es
’N the care of
baby’s skin and
hair, Cuticura
Soap is the
mother’s fa-
vourite. Not
only is it unri-
valed in purity and refreshing
fragrance, but its gentle emol-
lient properties render it of
great value in promoting skin
and hair health generally. For
the treatment of eczemas, rashes
and other itching, burning in-
fantile eruptions, warm baths
with Cuticura Soap, followed
by gentle applications of Cuti-
cura Ointment are usually effec-
tive when other methods fail.
Cuticura Soap wears to a wafer,
often outlasting several cakes
of ordinary soap and making
its use most economical.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold
throughout the world. A liberal sample of
each, with 32-page booklet on the care and
treatment of the skin and scalp, sent post-

Business, Robbery, etc
Herbert Rowe, one of the heads of the firm of
Blythe and Platt, who manufacture the Cobra boot
polish in Australasia, was entertained at a farewell
banquet by his friends the other evening. The func-
tion took place at Paris House, Sydney, and the
excuse was Mr. Rowe’s impending departure for what
Clara Butt describes in song as “The Land of Hope
and Glory.’’ He left by the Otranto. “Blythe and
Platt” is purely a trade name. The owners of the
huge Cobra industry are the Rowe family—the whole
Rowe family ; for whenever one of the sisters marries,
Cobra promptly swallows him; he becomes part of
the firm. It’s a delightful way to be polished off.
A large mass of N.S.W. loan money invested in “repro-
ductive works” will cease to produce anything but a
crop of interest after this month. The Glenbrook
deviation, on the Mountain line, has been opened for
some weeks, and the trains to the West have been
dodging the ruinous grades ; but the trains to Sydney
have continued to slither down the old track. The
duplication of the line on the deviation is now com-
pleted, however, and the “reproductive” work in
which much money was sunk will consist mainly of
a long, unused hole. The work of tearing up the
mortgage will, as usual, be left to a future genera-
tion.

“Fred Ellen”: If you ever put Milk-o’s money in
the billy or the jug, don’t. Not because of masked
burglars who might got there before Milk-o, but
because of the casual habits of Milk-o himself. I
happened to be awake when he called a morning or
so ago. Stumbling out of his chariot de lait, he
grabbed the can and splashed the fluid in without,
as I thought, seeing the cash. He did see it. though,
only the milk got there first. Unhesitatingly he
plunged his hand into the milk and rescued the
cash. Then he wiped his hand on his trouser-leg,
said “Gid-dap,” and went on cheerily with his load
of microbes.
* * * *
“Tiaki”: When Henare sells his land, has a cheque
deposited to his account in the bank, a cheque-book
in his coat pocket and a fountain pen to figure with,
he becomes “te pi-i-i-g rangatira.” Sometimes,
though, his ideas of finance are odd. Old Ropohama
had just started on his second cheque-book, and, in
a week’s time, he received an urgent call from
McPants, the clothier, to “come into the shop—want
to see you.” Ropohama followed. “Look here,”
said McPants exhibiting a blue pencilled “Refer to
Drawer” cheque of the old cannibal’s. “You shouldn’t
do this, you know. You’ve got no money.” Then
Ropohama’s wrath rose like an angry ocean. “Who
te herra te ferra he say I kot no money? I s’ow
you. I kot te prenty! Rook here!” And he
dived into his motor-coat and hauled out about
300 hundred pounds’ worth of “tenners.” “T’ere,
now. You say I kot te no money. Might pe I
kot more money ’an you. Py tchingo, I te good
mind to sue you for te libel.”
* * * #
Anonymous donors of the rare kind who really
don’t want their identity to become a public secret,
might take example from the “shabbily dressed”
citizen who lately handed a small brown paper parcel
to the hall-porter at the London Hospital, stating
that it was “for the hospital.” The parcel—-it had
been carefully sealed in sundry places—was taken to
the secretary’s office and put aside on the presump-
tion that the shabbily-dressed person had left some
light reading for the patients. Its contents proved
to be securities worth £lO,OOO and a half-sheet of
note paper inscribed, “For the good of the hospital.”
The secretary found the bonds and th ngs as good
as they looked, and turned them into cash, and the
identity of the benefactor remains wrapped in mys-
tery. It seems quite easy to do good by stealth
without having to blush to find it fame. Even a
newspaper par is not called for in all cases—any
parcels of securities left at this office will be treated
as strictly confidential.
“Ricardo”: The annual renort of the London
County Council, to hand by last mail, confirms the
dismal statements about the finances of the Big Fog’s
trams. For the first time since the electrification of
the main routes there is decreased revenue ; receipts
for the year ending March were £2,143,559, or
£88,343 less than in the previous 12 months. After
paying £730,687 interest on capital, the net profit
was only £497. The motor-’buses have driven off
with the rest.
“Me”: Some unpatriotic friend presented my kid
with a new toy. It was an alleged replica of the
Australian fleet, tiny warships made of plaster, with
Australian flags on every mast, each a quarter the
size of the ship. None of the toys resembled in the
remotest degree any vessels of the Australian fleet,
and every one, when launched, hurriedly capsized. I
found that the things were “made in Japan.” Per-
haps this is an example of Asiatic humor.
“Vagabond”: “Evrander’s” friend in the Clyde-
bank yard, where the Aquitania is building, is mis-
taken in reckoning that the new Cunarder will grab
the “record size” ribbon from the German Imnerator.
He says the Aquitania skiff is to be just the level
300 yards in length ; but the Deutscher’s measurement
goes 20ft. 6in. more than that if you count in the
figurehead, or lift, more without that trifle. The
Cunard’s only hope will be to call the ship the Uni-
cornia, and stick on a figurehead of a unicorn with
a spike projecting the 201 ft. “Eyrander’s” friend
says he expects the exact gross will figure out 57,000
tons. But even with the extra yard or two of length
the Imperator scales onlv 52,117, and I hardly think
the shorter Cunard is likely to be 5000 more gross.
Imperator’s displacement is 57,000 tons. The Clyde-
banker speaks, too, of the new cockleshell’s 20 knots ;
but the Hamburg-American is designed for 224, and
has already gone over the 234 without breaking a
staylace. One of the most interesting features of
the Imperator is the lifeboat arrangement. There
are 81 ordinary and two motor-boats. About a dozen
of them ate on the lower promenade deck, right in
under cover; which means that in spite of all the
“either-side launching” so strongly recommended
after the Titanic inquiry, the boats of this new
Titanic are more unlaunchable than ever, except
from one side.

London has resurrected an ancient industry, and
England is saved again. It is the burning of corks
—the outcome of the phenomenal success of the Pal-
ladium Minstrels, followed by a flood of imitators.
It is only by the burning of corks that the white
man can convert himself into an unimpeachable
Ethiopian entertainer. The corks are burnt to
ashes on iron shovels over a fire. A fine black-
powder is produced, which is sifted and mixed into
a paste with beer. Nothing but plain, ordinary beer
will impart the right hue to the 'complexion A
dozen discarded gates to liquid Hell (or Paradise-
according to the point of view) will produce a four-
penny tin, and if you want less than fourpenn’ortli
you’ve got to either cadge it or make it yourself.
LUCK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne papers have been making a disturbance
over dirty pound notes, pointing out the extreme
danger the people run of contracting disease from
them.
My luck, I think, has been the worst
That ever hapless mortal had.
For months with empty pockets curst
I saw friends on the joyous burst;
I saw the vulgar people glad ;
And I was thirsty, I was sad.
I could not find fit work to do ;
At begging I was diffident;
To steal I lacked the courage, too.
I dragged my battered bluchers through
A callous town. Where’er I went
Sour looks upon my rags were bent.
And now I’m down in quarantine.
The small-pox robs my soul of ease.
When 1 had not a blessed bean —
When starving, ragged and unclean —-

“Carrying things
from where they
are plentiful to
where they are
■
■
■
Is Elbert Hubbard’s definition of
Commerce.
Every Commercial undertaking has
to “carry things” from one place
to another.
The bigger the enterprise, the more
it has to carry—and the greater
the necessity for handling those
things in the most expeditious and
labor-saving manner.
WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE TO CONVEY?
Tell us, and we will place before you outline drawings with complete itemised
specifications for the System best adapted to your particular
MINE, FACTORY, BREWERY or SHOP.
We have already placed Jeffrey Labor-Saving Installations in quite a large

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Witchcraft.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rl'IIlE winds uf Spring are blowing.
' I 1 And it is good to be
_§_ Where some kind sun is sowing
Gold sparkles on the sea ;
While laughter wings the going
Of m y white witches three.
One witch that wears a dimple
And clouds of fragrant hair,
Hair that the salt airs crimple
While day-beams wanton there;
V witch demure and simple
And delicately fair;
\.nd one whose cheek can ferry
Clear blushes all the day
From shore to shore of merry
Blue, rippling Laughter Bay ;
With red lips like a cherry.
And black hair blown astray;
And one whose silken tresses
Are soft and mousey-brown,
With tenderest caresses
Her white brow smoothing down—
A witch who wears for dresses
Pearl lustres called a gown.
Amid the happy beating
Of my divided heart,
I know that I am cheating
A goddess who is smart
By metaphoric eating
Of my tripartite tart.
But, such an incantation
My merry witches sing,
My young imagination
'On broomsticks or the wing
Soars through the whole creation
Drinking a three-fold Spring.
Macbeth was well provided
With beldames in his day,
Strange bearded dames who sided
With Banquo in the play,
And fears and hopes divided
In an unpleasant way.
But my three fill the measure
Of gay and careless hours;
With all the silver treasure
That laughter round me showers,
They pluck the sweets of pleasure
And fill my world with flowers.
Yet wickedly they hold me
In bonds I may not break ;
While dreams of Spring enfold me,
I loaf for their sweet sake.
Whose shining eyes have sold me
To ways of tea and cake.
To ways of cake and chatter,
To paths of frivol young.
In sunlit glades to scatter
Sweet things I should have sung
But why should singing matter
Where wattle dust is flung?
Ambitious hopes are sleeping,
My greatness needs must wait
While joy her tryst is keeping
With Nancy, Jane and Kate;
I reck not of the reaping
Of harvests ripening late.
If life’s large debts are growing
I’ll pay them with a smile;
When clear, young winds are blowing
It is not worth my while
To mark the debit owing
Or bills of gladness file.
And so my witches hold me
Until the sun goes down.
Till big, warm nights enfold me
And all the world grows brown.
And various wheels have rolled me
Right back to beer and town.
Till o’er some midnight potion
I droop a weary eye,
While drear with late commotion
Wild hooting cars go by,
And I’ve a sleepy notion
That witchcraft’s wells are dry.

The Black Doll.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HAROLD URWIN prided himself on
being of the Norseman type, He
tried to heighten his resemblance
to Haarfager by encouraging a natural
exuberance in the matter of golden ia -ii,
and incorporating into his abun an .
straw-colored moustache strips of wns er
right down to the ,iaw line, whence ie
yellow fronds fell with piratical luxunanco
almost to his breast. He was nearly ■
tall, and had shoulders like Bjorn H'onsi t
or Rolf the Ganger. This imposing viking
was a reputable salesman in a city so
goods warehouse. He had a subtle ant
silky persuasiveness, invaluable for 11 ,al
purposes, and his successes in lace ant 1,1
gorie were the talk of the trade.
Annie Urwin, his wife, had Jj’lte
and was so poor in pigment that, 1

father lost his wits in babv s presene •
marvelled at her with an infatuation iuue
Pathetic. The three together unfailingly
suggested pale primroses.
Baby Irene was aged three f n
half when her father brought borne
black doll. It was a Christmas gift-
was just a nude piccaninny r ?f i ‘ s V < 1
moulded in plaster, and painted P|tcli b «
with very red lips and staring white ey
Ai first sight of this toy Irene screamed
with terror, and toddled away to hide her-
self. W hen they showed it to her again,
she took refuge in her mother's arms, and
lor some time after she buried her face in
the protecting maternal breast whenever
the black doll was brought out of its box.
Gradually, however, they wore down her
reluctance. Harold was most insistent.
“It’s such a contrast to her ethereal
beauty,” he said. "She will look so quaint
nursing the little nigger. We’ll have her
photograph taken for one of the papers, and
call it Darkness and Light.”
Presently Baby Urwin was induced to
look wonderingly at the black doll from a
safe distance. One day she grew bold, and
touched it. That evening she had it in her
arms, hugged to her breast, when her
father came home. She was seated on the
carpet under the breakfast-room table, rock-
ing her little body, and crooning softly.
Harold punched the atmosphere, and
roared his delight.
“Just come and have a look, mother!”
he called. “Did you ever see anything to
beat that? What’d I tell you about her
gettin’ mashed on that pick?”
But mother had been peeping in at the
family pride at short intervals throughout
the afternoon.
“She’s been nursing it for hours—the
darling,” she whispered.
“Come to daddy, little sweetheart,” said
Urwin.
But for the first time Irene declined.
She bent brows of stern reproof on her
father. “Hush!” she answered, “you will
waken baby.”
That was the beginning of Irene’s in-
fatuation. Afterwards she was rarely seen
without the black doll. Even when the
family went visiting, Pick must be one of
the party. It was a standing joke with
the Urwins’ friends to invite “father,
mother, Irene, and the black.” Many people
criticised Annie’s dubious taste in seeking
to advertise her little daughter’s exquisite
charm by continual repetition of this
odious comparison; but by this time poor
Mrs. Urwin was jealous of the black doll.
It had robbed her of Irene’s usual regard
and of much of her love. The tendernesses
that had been lavished on “pretty mamma’’
were now bestowed on “pretty Pick.”
None of the funny infantile demonstrations
went to mother. The black doll was little
Irene’s only confidante, her companion, her
fetich, and her baby. She would talk to it
for hours; she would sit perfectly still for
long intervals when Pick was supposed to
be sick or asleep, or she would croon over
it through a whole evening, down on the
floor, rocking her body, and chanting: —
✓ Croon, croon, croon
To de lil’ brack coon.
Yo’ mus’ sing ’im, yo’ mus’ swing ’im troo de long
afternoon,
Till de ole man be hangin’ out de new-washed moon,
’N’ de hoodoo_ loons
Come a-seekin’ baby coons,
Croon, croon,
Croo-00-oon.
In after life it distressed Mrs. Urwin
that her mind could call up no other pic-
ture of Irene as a child, but that of her
sitting on the breakfast-room carpet, rock-
ing the black doll, and singing:—
Croon, croon, croon
To de lil’ brack coon.
When the girl was _ seven her father
bought her a beautiful pink and white doll,
with flaxen curls and large, blue eyes that
opened and closed, but Irene turned her
back upon it. When they endeavored to
force her to acknowledge and accept the
white doll, she wept bitterly, with her face
in a corner, hugging Pick tightly in her two
ai *Next evening the two legs of the new
white doll were found sticking out of the
bars of the kitchen stove. No more ot it
“Pick told me to do it. lliat was all
the explanation Irene could give.
When Irene was 14 she had a black doll
named Pick. This was not the same doll,
for the child had always welconied a new
black doll if it were like the original lick.
In fact, she had insisted on having a new
one when the old one wore suspiciously
white in places. It was thought better to
buy her a new one than to have her refresh
the complexion of the old one with boot
blacking or stove polish. n ,
At 14 Irene no longer nursed her black
doll in public or before company. Her love
of Pick had now the zest of a secret wicked-
ness. She kept her black doll hidden in a
bottom drawer in her bedroom, and at laie
intervals her mother found her. sitting on
the rug by her white bed, rocking her trea
sure and crooning the negro lullaby. .
At 17 Irene was a deeply religious girl.
Her parents had deliberately designed it. It
seemed to Harold that her spintuelle beauty
demanded a sacred setting. T «n e had not
served to coarsen any feature of the girl.
daintiness. Her rose whiteness was tinned
with the tender pink that steals through the
shell of the nautilus, and her hair, soft am

When Urwin saw her singing in the choir,
or white-robed, taking part in some church
festival, he was suffused with a kind of holi-
ness that thrilled along his nerves, and liber
a ted the spring of tears. It seemed that he

had become a greater decalogue—an estab-
lished standard of moral conduct. Edgar’s
wooing was tinged with the fine traditions
of “the Firm.” lie had attended Irene Er-
win’s church for two years. For a year lie
Had loved her. The time was ripe for fur-
ther developments. Within six months from
the Sunday when lie first appeared on Har-
old Erwin’s mat, the engagement was an-
nounced. Jamieson, senior, had taken st< ck
<ff Irene over a space of 11 months, and at.
length had announced his, entire agreement.
She was, he said, “just the wife for the
Firm.”
. The engagement lasted a year The young
people were to be married in March, in the
meantime Edgar had not made much pro-
gress as a lover. He kissed her right cheek
when they met; he kissed her left cheek
When they parted. It was a formal cere-
mony, without emotion. But there was a
man stowed away somewhere in Jamieson’s
excellent black suit, under his spotless bell L
topper and the courtly suavity of the perfect
shopwalker, and that man was crying out
With increasing fierceness against the bar-
riers Edgar dared not break. He loved
Irene with passion; he was forbidden to
offer anything but cold service. He longed
t» take her fiercely in his arms, to hold her
close to him, and kiss her to life and warmth,
and always tile rigid saint seemed to rebuke
him.
, Once when Edgar’s kiss was impetuous
Irene cried out. and ran from him. As his
love grew she built up against him higher
and higher her ramparts of ice.
Irene had manifested little feeling when
young Jamieson began his courtship. She
accepted the engagement as a natural se-
quence, and was not opposed to it; but now,
as the wedding day drew nigh, unrest came
upon her like a fever. She was troubled,
tormented, never still, and her face that
knew little of smiling even in her childhood
became infected with a haunting fear. Her
parents noticed it.
t “Won’t you tell your mother, dear?” Mrs.
Erwin pleaded. “Here in my arms upon my
heart, whisper it.”
; Irene pushed herself free. “I have nothing
to tell you, mamma,” she said.
„ Edgar, too, had watched the development,
dfid was troubled by it. He even protested.
I “You are not fair to me, Irene. I feel
Sometimes that you shrink. Do you mis-
trust me? Do you think I may not make
you happy ? I love you. I will do anything
—anything you ask of me. Your work may
go on. You shall be near your people always.
For God’s sake, speak your heart to me.”
She offered her cold cheek to' be kissed,
Snd sent him away grieving and perplexed.
Irene’s parents told him that all would be
well, that this attitude was only natural in
qi gentle and timid nature confronted with a
great life change. He tried to be content.
On the morning of what was to have been
her wedding day. Irene was missing. There
Was a letter for her parents, merciless in its
brevity:—
•From to-day I know I can no longer be a
daughter to you. I see clearly that I am cutting
myself off from all, whom I have known. Good-bye.
IrenE.
The blow stunned Urwin and his wife. It
left in their faces the pathetic look one sees
on the face of a suffering animal. They
were affected alike, and would sit for hours
without exchanging a word, but the least
sound, a footstep on the path, the closing of
the gate, a knock, a cry, caused them to look
at each other with mute questioning, - and
eyes in which hope faded to pitiful vacuity.
Their sun had gone out, the stars had fled
from their heaven. Old age came on them
almost in a day.
Harold still worked for the Firm. Habit
is almost omnipotent. There was scarcely a
discoverable difference in the unctuous and
persuasive salesman. It was only in his
home that he lay prone under the burden.
They were? spending their savings in the
search for Irene. That search was begun
hopefully. When a year passed and no news
came of her, it was continued as a holy mis-
sion. If there were whisperings outside they
never reached those tw r o forlorn people in the
lone home. Harold and Annie visited no-
where now. saw.no one. The utter abandon-
ment of their misery had closed out even the
kindest hearts.
One evening when Erwin returned from
business, he. found his wife sitting on the
floor of their daughter’s bedroom, a black
doll in her lap, weeping desolately. She had
found the Pick secreted in a wardrobe
drawer.
Irene had been lost to them for over two
years, when a telegram came from Tread-
well, the private detective in whose hands
they had placed the case.
“Something for you. Come to Sydney at
once,” so the wire read.
They caught the express that evening.
Treadwell met them on the platform at the
Sydney station. He had a taxi-cab waiting.
They were driven away in haste. The agent
knew the hunger of their hearts. Up two
flights of stairs in a dingy slum building.
Treadwell opened a door, and stepped aside
for Urwin.
“Go in.” he said.
. The room was squalid. The furniture con-
sisted of little more than two broken chairs
and an old packing case. On a mattress
against the opposite wall a tall negro lav
asleep. Seated on the floor in the centre of
the apartment was a slim, fair woman who
bent over a sturdy black baby that fought in
her arms.
Annie stole to her husband’s side, clinging
to him, for the woman on the floor was
chanting a quaint lullaby :■ —
Croon, croon, croon
t To de lit’ brack coon,
Yo’ mus’ sing him, vo’ mus’ swing him troo de long

Jimjams.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
present article pretends to do no
| more -than touch the fringe of this
fascinating subject. There are hooks
enough dealing with hallucinations of the
ghost-seeing kind, but the pathology of Jim-
'jams has never received the attention it de-
serves. It is, of course, dealt with every
,day by doctors and druggists, but in an
empirical fashion only. I believe it to he
of sufficient importance to he specially
studied with a view to discovering its laws
and placing it upon a scientific basis. Jim-
jams are, by most people, looked upon as a
mental malady half-horrible_, half-grotesque,
instead of being regarded as aji invaluable
key to the obscurer workings of the brain.
* * * *
This is the age of Specialism, and here is
a fine opportunity for a specialist. He should
begin by carefully noting the particular
variety of: jimjams produced in the mind of
some selected subject by the exhibition of
different stimulants. There should be no
difficulty in obtaining a subject; the billet
would be rushed. The cost of the liquor used
in obtaining the desired results would be all
the expenditure necessary. There'might be
an inquest or two in the course of the ex-
periments. hut any intelligent coroner’s
'jury would unhesitatingly pronounce a ver-
dict to the effect that deceased perished
accidentally in the interests of science.
I used to know —lie is dead now —one of
the best authorities on .Timjams in the whole
of Australia. He informed me that a burst
on rum made him see rats, while at the
wrong end of a whisky-burst he invariably
saw snakes. When he had mixed his liquors
to an heroic extent he saw neither rats nor
snakes, but, instead of them, an old woman
with a black shawl around her head, and a
carving-knife in her hand, who wanted his
blood, and chased him around the room to
get it. He could give no reason why the
visions varied with the liquor. Other ex-
perts have told me that their experiences
have been similar. Here is a point that
should be elucidated. The questions to be
answered are: Hoes a certain kind of liquor
when taken to excess produce a certain kind
of jimjams regularly, or does it evolve, say,
rats at one time, and snakes or beetles at
another? Does it produce a different kind
of phantasmata with different persons? Is
it possible to raise new strains of jimjams
by cross-breeding, i.e., by mixing liquors
methodically, and in accordance with a defi-
nite plan? A satisfactory solution of these
problems would be a valuable contribution
to psychology.
* * * *
I have not known many persons afflicted
with jimjams, but I have known a few. To
begin with myself. I was riding on the
train from Melbourne to Brunswick one
dark winter evening when, to ray astonish-
ment, I saw a long line of black rats as big
as terriers, and with fiery eyes', running
parallel with the train. They were moving
in Indian file, and turned neither to the
right nor left, but kept straight on, as if
they ' had important business in front of
them. I shut my eyes and rubbed them—
but the rats were still there. I was highly
amused, and not in the least scared. I knew
that they were not real rats, and I was not
at all surprised when the entire procession
vanished suddenly. I never saw anything
of the kind before, and have never seen any-
thing of the kind since, nor can I account
for having seen it then.. Jim McNab (that
was not his name, but he was a Scotchman,
and it will do) told me that his jimjams
took the shape of a black parrot that
perched,on the head-rail of his bed. and kept
repeating all through the night: “Cut your
throat. .Tim McNab! Cut your throat. .Tim
McNab !” In his case the hallucination Was
so vivid that he used to curse the parrot, and
try to catch it and wring its neck. Another
man I knew used to see beetles by millions
crawling over the floor of his bedroom. Tliev
were very real beetles to him, and he laid
baits of poisoned paste for them.
An interesting, if somewhat cruel, experi-
ment was tried on a young man in Mgl
bourne during the Boom time. He was
drinking heavily, and his friends resolved to
make an attempt to scare him into sobriety.
One of them, a Cbll ins-street sharebroker,
had had a young alligator sent him in a
case from Queensland. The case, with the
lid off, was placed on the office table, and
several persons in the secret were present
at the hour when the young man usually
called. He came in, and. noticing the case,
observed jauntily. “What have you got
here?” lie looked into it with a bloodshot
eye, and started and turned pale. Then
he laughed nervously and exclaimed, “By
Jove, it did give me a scare!”
“What gave you a scare?” said the share-
broker solemnly.
“The dashed little alligator.” replied the
young man.
The sharebroker looked at him sorrow-
fully. and the other persons in the room
went one by one to the table, gazed into
the case, and shook their heads sadly,
“There’s nothing in the case,” they 1 said.
“O Lord,” cried the young man ; “I’ve
got ’em again.”
He was taken out for a pick-me-un and,
in the meantime, the alligator was lifted out
of the case, and placed in an adjoining
room. When he came back he looked into
the case once more.
“It’s no use boys,” he said, “I’ve got ’em
badly. It’s there still.”
The foregoing is an instance of jimjams
produced by suggestion.
* * * *
The jimjams of the Cultured Person are
much more terrible than those which afflict
the man of small education. The latter
sees rats, or snakes, or beetles of different
colors, _ but it takes more than a vulgar
visitation of that sort to shake the nerves
of the Cultured Person. The Dweller on the
Threshold, as described in Bulwer’s “Zan-
oni,” is about the size he takes in jimjams.
Dr. Samuel Warren, author of that onee-
famous book, “Ten Thousand a Year,” had
a patient who used to see a Thing in human
shape sitting on a chair by his bedside,
after he had been drinking heavily. The
Thing had no face, and no eyes to see with,
yet, in some horrible wav. looked at him
with an expression of unutterable malignity.
But jimjams of that kind are fortunately
rare.
* * * *
The Specialist in Jimjamology should
lay himself out to discover why the rats
and snakes, and other zoological spectres
seen by hard drinkers,are so often gaudily
colored. Possibly the congested blood in
the veins of the eye has something to do
with _ it. And here is another interesting
question: Is the nervous, imaginative Celt
more subject to jimjams than the stolid
phlegmatic Teuton? When that is an-
swered the specialist can proceed to investi-
gate what difference, if any, there is between
the jimjams of the two races. This opens
a wide field of scientific research. I leave
it to him. (

Adze slipped and caught his shin—Gaping wound i
which refused to heal Another Zam-Buk triumph, I
Also Wife’s five-year-old Ulcer Completely Healed.
MR. W. J. Ward, of 244 Perth Street, Subiaco, Perth,
W.A., who has been engaged in mining pursuits
all his life, and taken part in the principal “rushes”
on most of the fields on the Murchison, Kimberley, and
the latest at Bullfinch, says:—“While timbering in a
mine at Mount Magnet, W.A., through insufficient light,
I made a false stroke with an adze. The edge slipped
and caught me on the shin, inflicting a terrible wound.
The pain was dreadful, my leg swelled up to the size of
two, and 1 was completely disabled. My leg soon got
into a very bad state, and, although I tried many reme-
dies and had medical attention, nothing eased the in-
flamed condition. The wound was gaping open,
presenting a repulsive and angry appearance.
“Zam-Buk was recommended to me, and I commenced
treating myself with this splendid balm. I dressed
the injury night and morning, and in a few days the
aching pain was relieved, and the swelling and inflam-
mation resumed a more healthy appearance. T per-
sisted with Zam-Buk until the wound was completely
healed, and new, healthy skin grown over.”
“My wife, going into the kitchen one dark night,
struck her leg against the front of the grate. The
abrasion soon developed into an ulcer, around which
the surface was black and blue from congealed blood.
The wound refused to heal, and several times she went into the hospital,
and for over twelve months was an outdoor patient, but it did not get any
better. After suffering for five years, she commenced using Zam-Buk.
This splendid balm quickly drew out all poisonous matter, and cleansed
the wound, giving it a chance to heal, which it did rapidly. My wife'
continued applying Zam-Buk until her leg was completely better. Now
we are never without a supply of Zam-Buk handy.”

KEEP UP STEAM WITH
THE LEAST COAL.
It takes a good boiler to get the maximum heating quality out of every
pound of coal! That is why Goodall Boilers are so successful. They have
the efficiency that follows construction along scientili..' lines. They have the
long life that the use of the finest materials ensures. U matters not whether
you choose a Vertical or a Colonial type. You will find them the
standard in each case. Testing is carried to a point far in excess 01 anything
that could be met with under ordinary working conditions. If you want to
know all about the best boilers write our expert for further infQrmation.
He’s had experience that makes his advice very much worth while.
