A Surgeon’s View of History
In Post-Mortem (Jonathan Cape), Dr.
Charles MacLaurin, of Sydney, has devoted
his considerable literary gifts to a fascinat-
ing method of studying famous characters.
He explains their aberrations by their dis-
eases, or, rather, he diagnoses their diseases
by an examination of their aberrations. We
are, with the inevitable handful of excep-
tions, what our environment and bodily con-
ditions have made of us. Lord Balfour,
born eupeptic, rich and a member of a pri-
vileged class, remains a suave, amiable Con-
servative all his life. H. G. Wells —the son
of a professional cricketer, hampered in his
efforts to educate himself, the indignant spec-
tator of mediocrities achieving success of a
sort through family influence —grows bit-
terer in his hatred of the social system as
lie grows older. Balfour, so far as we can
gather from his writings and general be-
havior, thinks little of women. Wells dis-
closes in his later books a mind obsessed
with thoughts of women—young, beautiful
and preferably naked. When anyone hints
that his interest in nudity is remarkable
there comes from a section of his admirers
a cry of “Filthy-minded creature that you
are! Nudity is purity. The impure are
celibate priests, nuns and maiden aunts.”
In “Men Like Gods” the late Father
Vaughan (abhorrent to Wells, both as Jingo
and as Puritan), being suddenly transported
to another dimension where free love pre-
vails and everyone goes naked, holds forth
according to his training and temperament.
Whereupon :
Urthred spoke quietly and clearly. “Manifestly
this man’s mind is very unclean. His sexual imagina-
tion is evidently inflamed and diseased. He is angry
and anxious to insult and wound. And his noises
are terrific. To-morrow he must be examined and
dealt with.”
An elderly man 'such as Balfour might
we 11 be puzzled at the preoccupation with
sex of an elderly man such as Wells, and
still more so at his exasperation with those
who are not so pre-occupied or who. being
priests or parsons, teach that free love is
wrong. A MacLaurin would probably re-
solve the entire mystery in the words “en-
larged prostate”—the trouble which is to
blame for more old men’s marriages than
any other.
The first personage whom the author of
“Post-Mortem” approaches on these lines is
Anne Boleyn. If she had not been a nympho-
maniac, and if Henry VIII. had not acquired
syphilis, the whole course of English history
might have been changed. Anne might have
remained faithful to him and have kept her
head, or his strange assortment of wives
might have provided him with a healthy son
between them, instead of a series of mis-
carriages and two neurotic daughters. The
Reformation might have been delayed or
Calais held; and again the Armada might
have succeeded, and England been trans-
formed into a Spanish colony.
The best-known miracle in the career of
Joan of Arc was when she leapt from a 70ft.
tower and was saved from death by her
guardian saints, Margaret and Catherine.
It is easier to believe that at her early age—she
was then about 19, or possibly even less—her
epiphyseal cartilages had not ossified, and if she fell
on soft ground it is perfectly credible that she might
not receive more than a severe shock. I remember
the case of a child who fell from a height of 30
feet on to hard concrete, which it struck with its
head; an hour later it was running joyfully about
the hospital garden. It is difficult to kill a young
person by a fall—the bones and muscles yield to
violent impact, and life is not destroyed.
Here is an odd account of the death of
Charles V., who one day “caught a feverish
chill, took to his bed and never left it alive”:
For hours he held the portrait of Isabella in
his hands, recalling- her fresh young beauty-; he
clasped to his bosom the crucifix which he had taken
from her dead fingers just before they became stiff.
Then came the fatal headache and vomiting which
so often usher in the close of chronic Bright’s
disease. We are told that he lay unconscious, hold-
ing his wife’s crucifix, till he said: “Lord, I am
coming to Thee!” His hand relaxed —was the
motor-centre becoming oedematous ?—and a bishop
held a crucifix before his dying eyes. Charles sighed
“Aye, Jesus!” and died. Whether or no he died
so soon after saying these things as the good friar
would have us believe, it is certain that his end was
edifying and pious, and such as he would have
wished.
It is sad to have to record of so great a
man as Charles that he ate himself to death.
His splendid son, Don John of Austria, met
the fate that, three centuries later, was to
befall so many uf our own Anzacs. After
setting out what the historians have to say
of Don John’s last illness, the essayist con-
cludes
These events could be easily explained on the sup-
position that this young man’s brave life was ter-
minated by that curse of young soldiers —ruptured
typhoid ulcer in ambulatory typhoid fever. His
army was dwindling with pestilence; he himself
walked about feeling feverish and “seedy” and losing
weight rapidly for a fortnight; he was just at the
typhoid age, in the typhoid time of the year, and
in typhoid conditions; his ulcer burst, causing peri-
tonitis ;• the tremendous shock of the rupture, to-
gether with the toxaemia, drove him delirious and
then unconscious ; being a very strong young man
he woke up again as the first shock passed away;
as the shock passed into definite peritonitis uncon-
sciousness returned, and he was fortunate in being
able to hear his last mass before he died. I see
no flaw in this reasoning.
Benvenuto Cellini, Napoleon, the Empress
Theodora, Phillip 11. and others are dealt
with in the same delightful manner—ohe
which combines quaintly the historian, the
stylist, the philosopher and the tolerant, dis-
illusioned army M.O. Many of the essays
appeared originally in the Medical Journal
of Australia, but they will appeal to any
layman who loves good writing and the
pageantry of history.
J. B. D.
The Faking of History
For six or eight years I have been spin-
ning yarns in The Bulletin about early
British Australia and the people who lived
in it when it was mainly N. S. Wales, Van
Diemen’s Land and Norfolk Island, and have
published five or six unimportant novels hav-
ing to do with the same period and the same
people, besides the Lord only knows how many
stories for magazines, all of which means
that I have had to study a good deal of
Australian history from many kinds of offi-
cial and unofficial sources. But it means
another thing also—that I have had to take
such history and try to handle it so that, in
the stories and yarns, fact and fiction might
not too obviously be up against one another.
For the benefit of those who have not yet
tackled' this fairly difficult but not unin-
teresting job, I set on record here a few of
my experiences of it. It is neither as hard
nor as easy as it looks, but there are one
or two points about it that may be worth
considering.
There is no place in Australia where Aus-
tralian history may be studied with such
facilities as in Sydney. The late David Scott
Mitchell and the Royal Australian Histori-
cal Society are to be thanked for this, 'lhe
Mitchell Library is such a treasure-house •
of Australiana as exists nowhere else, and
the work that the R.A.H.S. has done, _ and
is doing, in explaining the comparatively
brief, but often very complicated, story of
this large island is beyond all praise. It is
only necessary to glance through its jour-
nals, since its foundation 21 years ago, to
realise this, as well as to understand what
a vast amount of labor and research the
members of that body have expended—for no
financial recompense—in seeking to tell the
story, in its variety of aspects, as truthfully
and exactly as has been possible. But the
journals are part of the equipment of the
Mitchell, and may be as well studied there
as anywhere else, so that the Maequarie-
street: institution remains the place where
it is only necessary to turn to find the means
of learning all that has been, or is to be,
learned concerning Australasia. And it is
also a place where every possible assistance'
is given to the student of Australian history
in finding out what he wants to know.
It is hardly to be expected that readers
of this paper will recall many of the stories
of old times that have been published on its
back page over the signature of the writer,
but in some of them the same characters,
real and imaginary, have so often figured
that he begs to apologise for using one or
two to illustrate what Ire means by “The
F.aking of History.” A disreputable imagi-
nary Ensign in H.M. 46th Regiment of Foot
named Colder has appeared in a good many
of them, in conjunction with an entirely re-
spectable brother-soldier named Lachlan Mac-
quarie, who is not at all imaginary, but a
very real and insistent fact in Australian
history. Mr. Patrick Calder had his birth
in the disastrous exploits of two subalterns
of the 73rd Highland Light Infantry, who
one night early in Macquarie’s reign ran
amok in Pitt-street and succeeded in slay-
ing an unfortunate citizen named Ilolness,
who resented their drunken attentions to his
wife. The story is told at great length in
Macquarie’s despatches to the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, and it seemed to sug-
gest that young gentlemen of commissioned
rank in the colony must often have been
bored into “kicking over the traces,” though
not with such unhappy effects, both to their
victim and themselves, as resulted in the case
of Lieutenants Macnaughton and Connor.
And they must also have had friends of
their own age in the Navy,- and in the Civil
Establishment, who would have been likely
to join in their diversions. So Lieut. Gre-
gory Wicks, R.N., and Mr. Acting-Deputy-
Assistant-Commissary-General Pilkington
came into being in type.
Now such characters as these are easy
enough to handle; but when it comes to
Macquarie, Colonel Mo-lie, Mrs. Macquarie,
Captain Piper and other people who really
existed, and of whom there is abundant bio-
graphical detail available, it is not quite
such easy going. You may liave_read all
Macquarie’s journals and papers that are in
the MSS. Room at the Mitchell, and know
all there is to be known about the others
after a lapse of a century, and yet. you can
only guess as to how they might have acted
in given circumstances. But, unless you are
to make them and yourself ridiculous, you
must not guess improbabilities. You must
make them act as it is likely that they would
have acted. And the only way you can do
this is by the most careful study of all there
is to be known about them —not only what
they have written themselves, but what
their contemporaries have written of them
and to them. And you won’t always find
that a thing that you can do in an after-
noon. It has, however, to be done.
Only those who have written this kind
of stuff may realise how fatally easy it is
to slip into error and absurdity. Over a
Bulletin story called “Mr. Belchamber”
that had to do with Norfolk Island in the
worst phase of its penal history, I spent
nearly four weeks reading the A’oluminous
report of a Select Committee of the House
of Lords on Transportation, the Life of
Dr. Willson, the first R.C. Bishop of Hobart
Town, all about Captain Machonochie’s ad-
ministration of the island, and a great deal
of other matter relating to real characters
in the story —and all this had to be boiled
down into 3500 words. Even then I was
disgusted to find, when the story was printed,
that I had made at least two inexcusable
mistakes.
There is always the possibility of going
astray in chronology, the finest sample of
which is to introduce a real character into
Australia before he arrived there. In
R.L.S.’s “Treasure Island” he made the sun
rise one day in the west; it is quite possible
in history Taking to make people live before
they were born, if you are not careful. The
writer had a story nearly completed when
he discovered that he had landed the Rev.
Samuel Marsden in Parramatta three years
before he left England to come to N. S.
Wales. And, to his grief and horror, he
picked up one of his own books not long
ago and found that he had' described Old
Government House at Windsor as having
been built by Macquarie, who landed in
Sydney in 1809, whereas it was built in
‘1796. The worst of two such bad slips was
that he really knew better. The realisation
of them was enough to make him feel that
he might as well have made Governor
Bligh cable the news of the revolt of the
Rum Corps to England, or George Bass to
have found the Straits that bear his name
in a motor-launch.
But history-faking has its proud moments.
It is possible to do it well enough to de-
ceive even the experts. I once printed an
extract from the wholly imaginary journal

The Burroughs Duplex
Two Adding Machines in One
Gives You—,
The Burroughs Duplex is virtually two adding machines
in one. It is equipped with two sets of adding wheels,
thus making it possible to list and add two or more
different groups of figures obtaining individual totals
and a grand total in one operation.
Every day you have figuring of this nature. For w
example, in sales recapitulation you can itemize the sales
by each department, clerk, or line. Then
as you take individual totals, the Duplex
stores them away, adds them, and gives
you a grand total of all sales automatically.
Or, if you desire, the Burroughs Duplex will
add two kinds of items simultaneously, as in
listing cost and selling price, weights and
amounts, debit and credit items, etc.
The Burroughs Duplex will also save you
time on payroll, inventory and
other figure work in which you
want individual and grand totals.
You will find the Burroughs
Duplex easy to operate. This
machine is constructed to
last a business life-time and
is made by the largest manufac-
turers of adding, book-keeping and
calculating machines in the world.
Ask us to demonstrate the Bur-
roughs Duplex on your work. There
is no obligation.

of a wholly imaginary character who was
supposed to have accompanied Blaxland,
Wentworth and Lawson when they achieved
the first crossing of the Blue Mountains in
1813. It was a page from the diary of a
rather illiterate personage describing one
day’s travel during that strenuous bit of
exploration, and my joy was complete when
Mr. Hugh Wright, of the Mitchell Library,
informed me that a Fellow of the R. A. H.
Society, who is an authority on W. C. Went-
worth, had rung him up to ask where the
fourth journal of the expedition was to be
found. An incident of that sort atones for
the consciousness of more than one foolish
mistake.
J. H. M. ABBOTT.
The Problem of Style
Someone has said that it is almost impos-
sible to write lyric poetry after 30, or to
produce a masterpiece of prose under 40.
It appears that prose is a more difficult, if
a less delicate, instrument than verse.
Students will remember the herculean and
heroic labors of Gustave Flaubert and Walter
Savage Landor to master the resources of
the French and English languages. Landor
made a life-long search for the word that
would fit the thing. Flaubert expressed his
ideal in a letter written to George Sand: —
I remember having experienced thumpings of the
heart, having felt a violent pleasure, in contemplat-
ing a wall of the Acropolis, a wall stark naked..,.
Eh bien! I wonder if a book, independently of
what it says, cannot produce the same effect? In
the precision of its groupings, the rarity of the ele-
ments, the polish of the surface, the harmony of the
ensemble, is there not here some instrinsic virtue,
a kind of divine force, something eternal as a
principle?
Among living writers no other has worked
so long and faithfully at the problem of style
as George Moore, in the recently-published
“A Portrait of George Moore in a Study
of Ilis Work,” by John Freeman, we are
told that Wilde said Moore would have to
write for seven years before he knew there
was such a thing as grammar, and then would
have to write another seven years before
he found out that a paragraph was archi-
tectural. “Wilde was right,” Moore now
confesses. “I did not know—l simply did
not know —how to write, and even now,
after more than 40 years’ diligence, I’ve
almost as much trouble with grammar as
with spelling; it’s incredible the trouble I
have to take in order to produce even the
passable sentences which other men write
unthinkingly. I’ve always been able to con-
ceive, to invent a story, and, though I couldn’t
write, I found that I could learn because
I wanted to learn. Words I have always,
and in abundance, and an ear for rhythm ;
my enduring foe is composition.” Freeman
says that he knows of no finer example of
the industrious apprentice than George
Moore offers to the faint yet pursuing writer.
Moore was born in 1852. He was 36 when
lie first published his “Confessions of a
Young Man” ; in the forties, when he pro-
duced the first versions of “Modern Paint-
ing” and “Esther Waters” ; nearly 60 when
he was writing the “Hail and Farewell” tri-
logy, and 64 when “The Brook Iverith” ap-
peared, in 1916. The earlier books have been
twice and thrice re-written; but the result
has been well worth the effort. Freeman
contends that in listening to his prose and
remembering that of his contemporaries,
a prime distinction is observed —Moore’s
is written from and for the ear, while the
prose of most others is written from the eye.
The thing heard rather than the thing seen
is the author’s prompter, and hence his
rhythm is the most beautiful thing in con-
temporary English.
In The Problem of Style (Oxford Univer-
sity Press). J. Middleton Murry finds Sten-
dahl’s definition the most satisfactory.
“Style consists in adding to a given thought
all the circumstances calculated to produce
the whole effect that the thought ought to
produce.” In this definition “thought” does
not mean thought in the ordinary sense, but
is a general term to cover intuitions, con-
victions, perceptions and their accompany-
ing emotions before they have undergone the
process of artistic expression or ejection
Stevenson insisted on the value of verbal
sound as the basis of style: “Each phrase in
literature is built on verbal sounds, as each
phrase in music consists of notes.” _ Walter
Pater laid more stress on the architectural
qualities of literature. “To give the phrase 1
the sentence, the structural member, the en-
tire composition, song or essay, a similar
unity with its subject and with itself —style
is on the right way when it tends towards
that.” Murry regards Stevenson’s doctrine
as heretical. “The emotional suggestion of
a word does not primarily reside in its sound,
but much rather in the imagery and literary
associations it evokes.” _ He challenges also
the pictorial theory, which he considers an-
other heresy. “Just as the author must
abstain from following after the mirage of
an impossible musical perfection, he must
not allow himself to be corrupted by trying
to emulate the art of painting.” Stendahl,
according to Murry, was a very peculiar
writer indeed. He wrote two of the great-
est of all French novels; yet his style—in
the most familiar sense of the word—was
non-existent. “I do not think that anyone
has ever more resolutely reduced the art of
writing to essentials than Stendahl.” Summed
up, a style is good when the communication
of the thought or emotion is exactly accom-
plished. But when style has begun to enjoy
an independent existence it becomes diseased,
as in much of the later work of Meredith and
Henry James.
Murry has many suggestive things to say
about the problem of style; and they are
not less suggestive because they make no
claim to finality. No one has ever said tne
last word on a problem of literary
criticism; but who wants the last word
to be said! “I am not expounding
a doctrine,” he says; “I am engaged in a
voyage of discovery.” But Murry, whose
own style is somewhat lacking in both musi-
cal and pictorial qualities, has discovered no-
thing that was not known to an infinitely
greater writer and greater critic, Gustave
Flaubert. Flaubert, like Moore, wrote more
for the ear than Murry deems necessary.
We know how he stamped throughout the
night in his provincial study, roaring like
a bull, and struggling with and testing every
rhvthm. In one sense, though he labored at
words all his life, he had no style, as Sten-
dahl had no style. Arthur Symons tells us
that the aim of Theophile Gautier had been
to construct a style which should be adapt-
able to every occasion; there is no struc-
tural change, the cadence is always the same.
But Flaubert had no fixed rhythm. He in-
vented the rhythm of every sentence, he
changed his cadence with every mood or for
the convenience of every fact. He had no
theory of beauty in form apart from what it
expressed. For" him form was a living thing,
the physical body of thought which it clothed
and interpreted. Thus it happens, as Symons
says, that each of his books has its own
rhythm, perfectly appropriate to its subject
matter.
There can be no end to the discussion of
the subtle relationship of form and matter,
especially as critics use the words rather
vaguely. “The ghostly entity of a style that
wanders about and attaches itself occasion-
ally to a piece of writing” must be a futility;
and yet, in another sense, it is form alone
that has significance in any work of art;
matter, subject matter in itself, does not
matter. It is probably the effort to trans-
form matter into “significant form” that
creates great art and literature. Flaubert
expressed the ideal of literature, which is. a
quest of the absolute, impossible of attain-
ment, when he wrote in 1852: —
What seems beautiful to me, the thing that I
should like to do, would be a book about nothing,
a book without any exterior tie, which would sustain
itself by the internal force of its style....a hook
which has almost no subject, or, at least, in which
the subject would be almost invisible, if that is
possible. The most beautiful works are those which
contain the least matter. I believe that the futuie
of art is in these channels.
LOUIS ESSON.
Literature and the Law
A medical friend commiserated with me
the other day for belonging to a profession
that is as dry as dust. He was in a hurry
to leave, and, as he was not going to perform
an operation, I did not feel in duty bound
to detain him. Yet I should not have
allowed the statement to pass unchallenged,
because it is inaccurate; it expresses a popu-
lar view that is also a popular delusion
and is gleaned from a fictional representa-
tion of a lawyer as a lean hatchet-face who
pores all day long over moth-eaten volumes,
and whose voice, raspy with evil-sounding
technicalities, issues from his boots. So far
from there being any truth in this assump-
tion, I submit that the legal profession is
the most interesting in the world: its possi-
bilities, like its happenings, are limitless;
its dramas are many and, in some cases,
Euripidean in their greatness; in its reports
and digests, in its very daily practice, there
lie buried stories amd incidents that if
revealed would bring their gift of laughter
as well as tears.
Still, there is some justification for the
remark of my friend. The inner workings
of the Law do not appeal greatly to the out-
side public. This is the fault of those
writers who have turned from law to litera-
ture and who, through motives of delicacy
or through a desire to forget the past, have
refrained from exposing their carefully-
guarded first-love to the coldness of print.
In authors whose knowledge of the intricacies
of the law is superficial, silence on such
topics is both understandable and commend-
able, for it requires a person with a partic-
ularly thick skin to carry out the programme
of Gilbert Frankau, who repeated in his
“Aliette Brunton” the ignorance of the con-
duct of a trial that he had displayed in his
earlier verse-novel, “One of Them.” Never-
theless, there are some who have dived for
material into this region of mystery. One
of the most poignant plays that J. M. Barrie
ever wrote, “The Will,” deals with the rela-
tion between two clients and a firm consist-
ing of father and son. In that masterpiece,
“The Way of All Flesh,” Samuel Butler
makes the creation of a secret trust an
important part of his story. Neither, of
these two writers had any legal training.
As for Dickens, he was employed as an
attorney’s clerk and had some experience, in
court reporting; but an inventive genius
was necessary to procure immortality for
the breach-ofi-promise action, Bardell v.
Pickwick, in which Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz
opened for the heartbroken plaintiff in so
brilliant a manner.
The one realm where I should not expect
lawyers to shine is that of poetry. And I
am‘not disappointed. Sir Henry Newbolt
is the only modern poet of any eminence
who attained distinction at the Bar. Tom
Kettle, the Irishman, turned to politics,
economics and then war-correspondence
work; while his compatriot, the delightful
James Stephens, dreamed his donkeys and
demigods on the hill of vision, and worked
as a typist in a Dublin solicitor’s office in
order to support a wife and child on a wage
of 265. a week. The ranks of the novelists
do not provide me with many recruits. John
Galsworthy, however, who became a barri-
ster in 1890, shows more than any other
author of fiction the influence of a legal
mind. He also knows a good thing when he
sees it —a faculty often inherent in lawyers,
and advanced in our disfavor —since it was
he who started Conrad in the right direction
by advising him to publish “Almayers
Folly.” His plays are built up as one would
construct a legal argument, bringing forth
the strength and the weakness of each side.
Take for instance his latest, “Loyalties,
wherein the case for the Jew who demands
the right to have satisfaction for his stolen
money is pitted against that of the officer
who seeks to rely upon the tradition that
the honor of a society man is unassailable ;
and in his novels, such as “In Chancery
and “The Country House,” he makes excel-
lent use of his acquaintance with the Law.
W L George and Gilbert Cannan are both
lawyers: the former has written instruc-
tively on divorce, and the latter should be
able to do so, as he married Barrie’s divorced
wife and was, in turn, divorced by her.
Maurice Hewlett, the author of so “any
romantic fantasies, was a member of the
Bar; in addition he was, for four years.
Keeper of the Land Revenue Records and
Enrolments. Belloc and Bennett both had
a narrow escape, their lathers being lawyers.
Hilaire fled to Oxford and Arnold into free-
lance journalism. Leonard Merrick, too
was intended for the legal profession, but
his father met with financial reverses, and
he after toiling in a diamond-mine and in
a solicitor’s office, became an actor-manager
until he emerged from a comparative obscu-
rity by persuading all the literary lords to
write introductions to his novels.
Amongst the critics William Archer and
Arthur Clutton-Brock are entitled to wear
the wig, although the former was not
admitted until some years after his visit to
Australia, becoming in the interval dramatic
critic of the Figaro. John Buchan, novelist
and historian, was a barrister of the Middle
Temple before he became secretary to Lord
Milner in Africa. Philip Guedalla, one of
the fortunate young men of English Letters,
occupies his time in writing the history of
Napoleon 111., character studies of famous
figures (e.gr., “Supers and Supermen”) and
in studying Commercial Law as a pupil of
Sir Walter Schwabe. Another practising
barrister is George Somes Layard, who estab-
lished his literary reputation by the publica-
tion of “Queer Stories,” which he followed
up with a number of novels; but he is best
known for his research in the field of book-
engraving. There is, of course, Mr. Justice
Darling, whose “Scintilla Juris” still pro-
vides the London weeklies with columnettes ;
and Lord Riddell, who shall be remembered,
if for no other reason, then for his famous
list of books that will give a man a full kit
of learning. These are the first chapter of
Anson on “Contracts” and Pollock on
“Torts,” the first 63 pages of Best on “Evi-
dence,” Shakspeare, and an anthology of
English verse. It is, I think, a very fine
little list; but when I am older I hope to
compile one much shorter.
W. E. LEICESTER
The Australian Accent
There is a story about it which almost
every big passenger ship in the Anglo-Aus-
tralian trade claims as its very own. Many
passengers carry queer animal pets with
them, but the queerest known belonged to
an Australian who, whenever the weather
was at all bad, called aloud to the cabin
steward to bring him his bison. After listen-
ing to English people for a few months
and getting my ear used to the noises they
make, I have spent some weeks trying to
find Australians who call for “bisons,” and
I haven’t had much luck. “Bison,” for
“basin,” is Cockney, and not typically Aus-
tralian. No doubt there are people in Aus-
tralia who turn their a’s into i's, but that
is mostly because there are Cockneys in Aus-
tralia, just as there are Cornishmen and
Scots. “Bison” isn’t easier to say than
“basin,” and in his speech the Australian
takes the line of least resistance. He will
rather say oi than i. A youngster in a
theatre, selling some brand of confectionery,
drawls: “Eskimo Poi.”
In “Huntingtower,” one of his later
novels, John Buchan introduced a likeable
Australian, and said pleasant things about
the Australian speech, “which has the sun
in it.” I don’t know for certain what he
meant, but guess he thinks that we are in-
clined to loaf on the job. The charge, if
he meant it that way, strikes me as one
to which we will have to plead guilty. We
don’t go in for deliberate affectations. The
ear of a considerable section of the English-
at-home has been hurt by the Cockney habit
of saying “plice” for “place,” and there has
been a rush in the opposite direction, so that
“wine” becomes “wane.” There is always
this tendency on the part of the “naice” to
do wrong because the not-so-nice have been
guilty of another kind of fault with which
the “naice” don’t want to be identified. The
more-or-less educated hear the uneducated
say that “me and my young man went to the
pictures last night with my mother.” Where-
upon. horrified at such a misuse of me,
the more or less educated young lady says:
“Mother chaperoned my fiance and I to the
pictures last night.” No “me” for her, even
when it is right! Certainly there are Aus-
tralians who do this sort of thing, but they
seem to be few. For the most part they
can’t be bothered. Thus, though we may
have a few who go to the “rices,” we have
hardly any guilty of the affectation of hav-
ing “raice” for breakfast.
Our tendency to loaf on the job is no doubt
responsible for what appears to be the most
distinguishing lapse in our speech. We tend
to allow some of the broad vowel sounds to
fall into disuse. We meow. “Sounds” be-
comes “seounds,” our cows are keows. in
England there must also be the same ten-
dency ; at any rate, you note among people
who aim at extra-special propriety a protest
in the shape of a determined over-broaden-
ing. With these a sound isn’t a sound;
it is a soand, and you walk on the groand,
not the ground. The Australian tendency
is even more marked in the handling of final
vowels. “You” has been abolished in many
mouths: “yeh” or “yer” or “ya” has taken
its place. And with it comes a clipping of
many syllables: “Willya come up t’our
place ’saft’noon?” This strikes the ear
harder than any other trick of Australian
speech. And yet there are times when it is
easier to end on a vowel; 'so we get the
“good-o” and “riglit-o” group, which is really
a loafing on the job, too.
Of course there is the so-called Ameri-
canisation of the language, but you don’t
notice that much outside Sydney. Else-
where a man can still hold a position: m
Sydney he must hold it down. But these
American fashions don’t last, fortunately
chiefly because they are not really Ameri-
can, but only sectional. There is nobody
like the cheaper New York journalist for
working a new expression to death. A while
ago he couldn’t write half a column without
having “bromide” in it. He has already
forgotten it, and there is a good chance even
of “some” being allowed to return to its
proper use.

Green Butterflies, by Roy Bridges (Hutchinson).
In this skilful yarn of early Hdbart and Port
Phillip, finishing up in the Melbourne of to-day,
Bridges introduces the idea of the repetition of a
certain type in succeeding generations, which Herge-
sheimer picturesquely exploited in “The Three Black
Pennys.” But this theme is only an incidental in
the Australian’s tale, like the motif of the green
butterflies that provides the title, the author being
more concerned with the development of the charac-
ter of Esther Wane after she has been seduced and
deserted by a gay young man and marries a hard-
bitten churchgoer to give her boy a name. The
novel is full of veracious characterisation —the sort
of summing up of human beings that sets down
virtues and weaknesses with a judge’s candor and
strength.
“Schnorrer’’: Old Henry Harris, proprietor of the
Hebrew Standard (Sydney), who died the other day,
was said to be 85, but was probably several years
older —both he and his family were vague about his
actual age. He had been 60 years in Australia. It was
his son Phil who started the trench paper Aussie in
Prance, and put it into civvies on his return.

MsTeh “S” Shear, with sectional view of Patent
Taper Self-levelling Crown Plate.
“Did not have to open up any handpiece fitted with the
patent Crown Plate during the whole shearing”
is the gist of hosts of experts’ reports that have reached us for several seasons past.
They appreciate the ease with which the Lister Crown Plate can be fitted and the
assurance it gives of perfectly level tension for the shearer. Only one conclusion is
possible from these reports—that a handpiece fitted with this Crown Plate is never
out of action while needed-—in other words, it is 1 00% efficient.
Think what a saving it will mean to have all the machines in your shed in this
condition—no time wasted, less money to pay out and the clip in better condition for
sale. And Listers will do it—for every part of the Lister machine is as thoughtfully
designed as the patent Crown Plate. Let us tell you all about it.

O Man, My Lover!
When night draws on and the dim ciouds
hover
Like ships adrift in a tideless sea,
And the dark comes closer intent to cover
A world in pain and lust’s pageantry,
Need of you, hate of you, comes to me,
O man, my lover!
Down all the years you have sought and
wooed me,
Making a wreck of my peace and pride;
Mocking my fears, you have still pursued me,
Craving my body and naught beside.
Thus do you ever, till faith has died,
O man, elude me!
I, the quarry, have lured and sought you,
Tricked you, baffled you, tracked you
down.
Glamor and dream and despair I’ve brought
you,
Dotard or stripling, king or clown.
While I have fled from you, feigning to
frown,
O man, I’ve caught you.
So shall it be till all time is over,
And Death stalks lone by the stagnant sea.
While the sun at his setting cannot discover
One man left in his misery.
Will you hunt me still through eternity,
O man, my lover?
N.s.W.
MARY E. SURRIDGE.
In Defence of a Friend.
And he is vain? So shall he not offend.
The lovely scarlet lilies flaunt their hue.
With never a leaf between. The garden
through,
There’s not a blossom but its beauties tend
To self-assertion, and to Nature’s end.
Here is a violet, of softest blue:
It spreads its perfume; advertises, too- —
No! for all this I must admire my friend.
But most I love what most he hides away,
As gold is hidden in the scarlet lily,
By high unclouded suns alone revealed ;
And, looking further, further still, we may
Envision springs in places lone and hilly,
Fathering all the wealth our gardens yield.

Bottle Brush.
The parrots found them at the dawning,
And whistled over their honey-cones,
And the amber harrows of green-framed
blossom
By the grassy cliff, and the tide-bright stones ;
And the wind came up from the blue March
sea,
And chased a sweetness from tree to tree.
Shadows sway on the wiry grasses ;
A red road winds among the bush;
Only a wild-bird pipe to waken
A faun asleep in the noontime hush —■
Was it wrong we should crave one peep,
Till Love awoke in a world asleep?
For the far-green aisles are forever calling,
And the wave has stirred to a smile of foam,
And hearts grown sick of the ways of cities
Are footsore wanderers, nearing home.
Here a hollow cries for the water’s loss,
But the fallen trunk makes a bridge across.
How soft the sand in the empty runnel!
It whispers “rest” where the sunbeams stray.
We can wake and watch on a cold to-morrow,
But the gods have placed in our hands to-day.
Will the breath of honey-blooms keep us wise
With our eyes so close to each other’s eyes?
Bottle brush in a little clearing,
Where the parting leaves show a sapphire
sea—■
The gods have used it to paint a picture,
Dipped in sun, for the days to be.
We were fools had we let that moment slip:
The honey lasts on a tasted Up!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Grey Witch.
There are nine wind horses in the stable,
But her hand is on the bridle of the south.
Her flying robe is lavender and sable,
And the laughter of the seas is on her
mouth.
She has gathered all the shadows at her
calling,
And merrily they follow in her train;
From her pale hands the seed pearls are
falling.
And she kisses happy mountains in the
rain.
In the witchcraft of her eyes there is no
burning—■
The thunders all are sleeping in the
caves —•
As she softly rides the dusk at the days
turning
With a look as of waters and of waves.
And she cries, as the summer calls to
swallows
In the long dipping flight across the seas,
Till my heart with a great longing follows
The grey witch sighing in the trees.
At tlie raising of her hand the march is
ended,
And the banners of the light are softly
furled;
No longer may the sun with pennons splen-
did ,
Bead the lances of his fire across the world.
I have loved the morning’s flight of silver
arrows.
I have thrilled to see the day’s imperial
fall;
But, when tenderly in mist the broad way
narrows,
The grey witch is dearest of them all.

FREEDOM AS A NATIONAL
INSURANCE POLICY.
It is significant that the approach of. May
Day, the Feast of the patron saint of
Anarchy, should this year have witnessed
these developments, amongst others: —
(1) Jock Garden, for years one of Australia’s
loudest advocates of Bolshevism, returns to Sydney
from a visit to Moscow, with the remark that,
“while the Soviet system may be all right for
Russians, it is unsuitable for a nation of the cul-
tural development of Australia.” If there was any
genuine Communism in Russia he appears to have
missed it, though he has high praise for the Russian
educational system —the effect of which must be, as
elsewhere in the world, to produce individualists.
(2) Jim Larkin, for years Ireland’s most con-
spicuous Red Flagger, returns to Dublin and an-
nounces: “Peace is our motto, and we shall work
for peace in Ireland. Any section who continue
fratricidal strife will be branded as traitors and
renegades to the cause of the people.”
(3) Nearly a quarter of a million English people
try to see a Cup tie football match, and give the
King as rousing a reception as monarch ever had.
The races of the world differ widely in
countless respects; but one aspiration, any-
how, they have in common —the desire to go
about their lawful occasions with the mini-
mum of interference from authority. The
unending battle for freedom has merely been
a series of efforts to delimit the r : ght to
interfere claimed by a pope, a iking, a
usurper, a Minister or a foreign nption. The
battle must continue as long as civilisat’on
lasts, since the desire to enslave is as strpng
in man as the desire to be free. No one
color, race, religion or class has a monopoly
in the. matter of alacrity to impose its will
.on those who lack the courage or ability to
resist. Towards the end of the 18th cen-
tury an idea became prevalent in Europe
that true freedom was only to be achieved
by abolishing the monarchical system. BTance
tried it and acquired first the Terror and
next the Bonapaktes, just as Russia more
recently acquired its Tenor and the Lenin-
Trotsky rCg-me. England, which has never
been strong on the total prohibition of any-
thing, from beer to kings, went in for re-
forming the business of government, wiih
results that the world has viewed admiringly,
not to say enviously, in the last eight years.
Mistakes were made, no doubt, and injus-
tices done; profiteers took advantage of the
war to rob the nation, and bureaucrats
employed war-legislation to tyrannise over
it. But this can be said: no country got
back more expeditiously to pre-war con-
d.tions as represented by constitutionalism
and the rule of law. The British are work-
ing again after putting up a stupendous
fight on land and sea and in the air. They
are paying their debts, and not even the-
bitterest Radical can deny that the rich are
doing their fair share here, as the majority
of them did in the army and the navy dur-
ing the war years. And, on the whole, the
nation is satisfied, while relatively to new
democracies such as Russia and Germany it
is more than satisfied. Above all, if the re-
cent demonstration at Wembley means any-
thing, the British are satisfied with the sys-
tem of government they have evolved out of
nearly a thousand years of effort.
» * • •
In order to understand what a large in-
stalment of freedom the British have assured
themselves by the various controls they have
put on the monarchy, it is only necessary to
consider some of the countries which enjoy
the other sort of freedom. Professor
Chafee, of Harvard University, has just
published a book, “Freedom of Speech,”
which will be a revelation to most people in
regard to the extent to which unfreedom
obtains in the Land of the B’ree. The world
has always known of those denials of free-
dom in tne IJ.S.A. which are represented by
police “graft,” the discouragement of Trade
Union activities, etc. Professor Chafee
shows that the same spirit exists in every
section of the nation’s life, with the result
that bodies like the Ku Ivlux lvian and the
American Legion are taking the law into
their own hands without any real fear of the
consequences. So long as the alleged re-'
formers persecute enemies of the Govern-
ment or critics of prominent officials, they
are safe. The situation in parts of the
U.S.A. differs only in degree from that of
Ireland in those regions where De Valera
and his friends are operating. More inoffen-
sive citizens are shot in Ireland, more houses
burnt and more businesses ruined. But the
principle is the same—-a denial of the
majority’s legal rights; and the result is the
same —no one is secure, physically or materi-
ally, for 24 hours on end. The reaction
against such an intolerable way of life is to
be seen in Russia, where a few strong men
regulate everything, as certain European
civil servants do in the case of the back-
ward peoples of Asia and Africa. What
Garden meant when he said that Australians
are unfitted for Soviet rule was simply that
Australians are too high in the educational
scale to put up with unfreedom. They
might find themselves under the sway of a
despot of the highest moral character. He
might introduce prohibition in the interests
of sobriety, abolish horse-racing in the inter-
ests of solvency, and insist on a number of
other changes, all beyond criticism on ethical
grounds. His virtue would be no excuse in
the eyes of those who objected to their legiti-
mate activities being interfered with, and
they would throw him out in favor of a
constitutionalist of indifferent moral charac-
ter at the earliest opportunity. Garden dis-
likes Leninism, though he is sure that its
intentions are good: he was not brought up
as a serf. Larkin calls for peace, because
war, whether it is a world-war or an Irish
war, or a Ku Klux Klan war, is the nega-
tion of liberty. The English give their king
an astonishing reception, not that he is a
particularly dynamic monarch, but because
he represents freedom.
**.*•'#
A nation preserves its freedom by attend-
ing to its defence, to its laws and to.
the administration of its laws. Sometimes
it is lulled into the belief that the instinct
to prey has been exorcised from man ; and
immediately it finds itself at war under a
killing handicap. Sometimes, again, a nation
forgets that kings and king’s Ministers are
without absolute power only because that
power has been denied them: it grows
momentarily oblivious to the fact that it is
the nature of all officials, high and low, to
beg, borrow or sneak every fragment of
additional power they safely can. It might
have been expected that the frightful abuses
of their powers by Governments during
the war would arouse the people concerned
to watchfulness of their freedom for the
rest of their lives. Actually the curous
effect was to make many careless who before
the war were vigilant. The paradoxical
idea got about, and still prevails, that peace
and good government depend on wide pow-
ers ruthlessly exercised —on the conditions,
namely, that have produced nearly all the
most disastrous wars and revolutions. Even
where Governments returned to the people
their liberties to the extent of repealing War
Precautions Acts and the like, they retained
tremendous powers under the rose, and no
effective protest was made by Parliaments
which had learned nothing so well as the ait of
being servile to Ministers. Before the war
all the States of Australia had Vagrancy
Acts and other measures which gave the
police ample power to deal summarily with
known offenders against the public sense of
what was right and decent. The war gave
us an Act which made it an indictable
offence to criticise the Hughes Government
unless in the lightest terms. We have in-
herited from that Act others which make it
an indictable offence, say, “to excite disaffec-
tion against either House of Parliament”—a
practice of which many otherwise law-abiding
citizens are guilty one way and an ther
every week of the*r lives. Every measure
of the sort should go. Like the passport
system, these laws are justifiable, if at all,
only when a nation’s life is in danger. All
they do under peace conditions is to tempt
politicians to discriminate not only against
confessed enemies of society, but against
the enemies of their party or class, and so
to produce the conditions from which even
the world’s Gardens and Larkins are be-
ginning to recoil.
A MODERN PRESTER JOHN.
After a short period of 50 years spent in
limbo, Prester John has reappeared in
Asia. The indestructible phantom first made
its appearance in the 12th century in the
shape of a legend of a great Christian mon-
arch ruling somewhere in Asia over mil-
lions of Christian subjects. Popes used to
write letters to the pious potentate, and mis-
sionary friars plunged into the grim black-
ness of Tartary to deliver them. Appa-
rently they succeeded, for European libraries
have cop.es of the eloquent and satisfactory
replies the Popes received from the princely
saint. As the centuries went by the pic-
ture of the Presbyter Joannes, his splendor
and piety, became fixed in the imagination
of Europe, along witn Gog and Magog, and
the men who wore their heads beneath their
Shoulders. Extravagant hopes were enter-
tained of what the conquering prince was
doing to the enemies of Christendom. Every
rumor of war amongst the restless tribes
of Central Asia which filtered through to
Europe was associated with his name, until
Christendom became obsessed with the idea
that a mighty almond-eyed crusader was
sweeping across Asia, dispelling the clouds
of paganism as he came. At one time Jingis
Khan was confounded with him, and that
terrible overflowing of Asia upon Europe*
which might have made a Buddhist temple
of Rheims Cathedral, was at first received
witn Christian acclamations, which the smoke
of burning cities changed to lamentations.
"When the Tartar flood rolled back it left
a highway for the first time between the
two continents, and along this road flocked
the missionary friars, still in quest of Pres-
ter John. That delusive spectre had van-
ished into thin air, only a disreputable
wraith of him being found in a bloodthirsty
and dissolute Kerait chief, who, along with
his 2.00,060 warriors, had indeed embraced
Christianity, but whose reputation was such
that the worthy friars were fain to report
that he had since abandoned it for Buddhism.
In the 19th century the long-lived delu-
sion re-arose. The new Prester John was
Hung Siu-Tsuen, the son of a small farmer
near Canton, and one of the despised Hakka
race. Having failed to obtain a civil-service
appointment, after passing the examinations,
he took to spiritualism, and compounded a
religion of his own. Calling himself the
Taiping King, he found a following amongst
the hungry hordes of bandits and beggars
in Kuangsi, and with this rabble, fanatically
inspired, he began in 1852 a march across
China which nearly ended the Manchu reign.
In the city of Nanking, where he set up his
ghostly court, an English bishop was moved
to give him his benediction, and many mis-
sionaries believed that China was passing
through a blood-bath from which she would
emerge regenerated and converted. Their
hopes were disappointed. The subtle corro-
sion of an Oriental Court soon began to
eat away Hung’s not too robust virtue.
A harem and a corps of eunuchs were added
to the Celestial entourage, and while his
army plundered and massacred the heathen
populations of the surrounding cities, Hung
sank into a life of lechery and drug-taking.
Finally he swallowed gold, and Prester
John and the dream of a Christian Asia
once more vanished into thin air.
Prester John’s latest avatar is Feng
Yu-Ilsiang, the Christian tuchun of Honan.
Feng, a protege of the Y.M.C.A. in Peking,
started in a small way as crusader with
1500 Republican troops in 1912. In 1914
he distinguished himself under Wu Pei-Bu
in the Anfu dispute, and was given the com-
mand of 10,000 men. In 1921 he was made
military governor of a small province, and
in 1922, in the war with Chang Tso-Lin,
the crack Eleventh, as his division of Chris-
tian soldiers was known, were the deciding
factor. B’eng, with an army of 50,000, then
became tuchun of Honan, one of China’s
richest provinces, where he was absolute
autocrat over a population of more than 25
millions, crowded together 350 to the square
mile. The intrigues of the parties at Peking
recently ousted him from these entrench-
ments, and he was appointed high inspector-
general of the national army, a finer-sounding
but less important position than that of
tuchun. But B’eng showed he had no inten-
tion of giving himself over as a burnt-
offering to his rivals, and when he took up
his new appointment his personal army,
equipped with heavy guns, quick-firers,
motor-ambulances, field wireless, psalm-books
and umbrellas, moved down to Peking with
him.
Feng has introduced a new terror into
Oriental warfare. Not content with lopping
the heads of the bandits he captures, he first
tries to convert them. His army is the most
economically managed of any in China. In
his capital city of Ivaifengfu, he abolished
gambling, alcoholic beverages, the wearing
or silk, rich banquets, redlight districts, im-
proper literature and theatres, and replaced
them with moral lectures, to business men
and Bible-classes for his soldiers. His
fellow-tuchuns had previously considered
civil war as a pleasant game, and never for-
got that the victor of to-day might be the
fugitive of to-morrow; but Feng established
a precedent by executing a rival general he
had captured, treating him as a traitor to
his country. He dresses in cheap cotton, and
insists on his officers affecting a like humil-
ity. When he withdrew from Kaifengfu
B’eng went, the missionaries reported, am'dst
the tears and lamentations of all right-
thinking people.
The missionaries foresee their brilliant
young protege in the presidential chair, or
even on the Qragon throne, and dream
dreams of a Chinese Constantine convert-
ing liis 400 million subjects to Christianity
by a stroke of the pen. The mass conversion
of Asia has long been the hope of Christen-
dom ; for the slow process of persuasion has
not achieved very much. In the 13th cen-
tury the Nestor'an Christians had 25 sees in
Asia, embracing the regions from Armenia
ai d the Persian Gulf in the west to Tanvut
and Cambalec or Peking in the east. Mis-
sionary effort since then has never slackened,
and yet at the present time the number of
native Christ"ahs of all sects in China is not
much more than a million. The fresh con-
verts number about 100,000 annually; but,
since the annual net increase of population
is about four millions, the surplus of new
pagans over new Christians increases every
year by 3,900,000. At this rate of pro-
gress China is never likely to be Christian-
ised. In the treaty ports missionary activity
is almost prominent enough to inspire con-
fidence in its future, but the unprejudiced
traveller going further afield is bound to
come to • other conclusions. The Taiping
rebellion was the nearest China ever got
to being Christianised. Between Canton and
Nanking it destroyed all the most splendid
monuments of Buddhism. To this desecra-
tion the gods answered never a word, and
the Buddhist faith received a blow in conse-
quence from which it is only just recovering.
The Christian missions cannot hope to have
such an opportunity again. Their present
efforts are like ripples on the ocean of
Chinese humanity. That ocean may be
stirred to its depths and rise in wrath again,
but it will not be with Christian frenzy.
Christianity is to-day the doctrine preached
by the feared and detested foreigner; before,
it was the peculiar revelation vouchsafed by
God to the Taiping King himself, and even
then its success was only momentary. Any
national movement of tne future will be
directed against the foreigner and his Chris-
tian church.
FENG-SHUI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Merely a Stopgap.
The position as regards the plethora of Aus-
tralian income-taxes is that the Common-
wealth Government, having the war-bill to
pay, can’t go out of the confused business,
and the State Governments won’t. After
months of profound thought the Bruce-
Page Ministry has hit upon the notion of
letting the States levy on “individual incomes
amounting to less than £2000,” the Common-
wealth coming in at that point and taking
its toll of “the excess over £2OOO, at a rate
applicable to the total amount of income.”
The proposal, in short, is that the present
Commonwealth impost should be metamor-
phosed into a super-tax on large incomes,
which plan, Bruce calculates, will save
£400,000 of the £600,000 p.a. now fooled
away in the duplicated departments and free
742,244 taxpayers—99 p.c. of the whole —
from the obligation of making dual returns
and arguing the point with twcr hungry
swarms of assessors, collectors, commission-
ers, deputy-commissioners and their kind.
There is also a hope that the army of extra-
departmental experts which has been gen-
erated by the putridity of the present sys-
tem will, for the most part, find its occu-
pation gone. In 1921-22 the incomes which
Bruce offers to abandon to the States pro-
duced tax amounting to £7,977,407. In re-
turn for this concession the States are to
give up their claim to the 255. p.h. p.a. from
the Customs and excise revenue, which
yielded them £6,943,955 last year. However,
Westralia and Tasmania are to go on receiv-
ing the special payments tacked on to the
surplus-revenue measure, which expired in
1920; also, if their income-tax collections
under the new arrangement are less than at
present the difference will be made up.
All told, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment proposes to surrender 1£ millions
p.a. during the five years it is proposed that
the scheme should last. It is a big sacrifice
of revenue that is urgently needed for
national purposes, and there are other objec-
tions. One is that it is unsound finance to
throw on one class, and that a very small
one, the entire burden of paying war-interest
and sinking fund, the Commohwealth’s re-
venue from income-tax being wholly devoted
to that object. Another is that the National
Government is under no obligation to com-
pensate the State Governments for the loss
of their 255. a head from the Customs and
excise revenue, since the people refused, by
referendum, to grant them that or any other
sum in perpetuity, and they have received all
they were entitled to under the Surplus Re-
venue Act, and a good deal more. Armed
with the right to retain all the Customs and
excise money, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment could give Australia the boon of one
income-tax and one assessing and collecting
authority by deciding to do the business itself.
After the impotent fury of the State Frights
had expended itself, they would sourly accept
the inevitable. Failing this, the only perma-
nent solution of a problem created by the
war, the Bruce-Page stopgap scheme will
serve—for five years. It will certainly save
the public much of the maddening worry
and waste incident to the present plague of
taxes and tax-gatherers.
Where Factories Refuse to Bloom.
Taylor, leader of the Queensland United
party, asks questions :
Mills are being erected in N. S. Wales to spin our
Queensland cotton. Why isn’t there one going up
at Rockhampton, in the district where the cotton is
grown?* How is it there are not more woollen
mills in Queensland, considering our great output ot
wool ?
His answer in each case is “burglari-
ous taxation,” and it is so difficult
to confute him that the fluent failures
in office haven’t attempted it. They
find it easier and safer to shout that
Taylor is a hireling of capitalism, that
“wage-slavery” ought to be abolished m
favor df “production for use, and not for
profit.” and that the Australian flag is good
enough for them. (The last is the special
cry of Huxham, Min.ster of Public Instruc-
tion, who never saw Australia till he was
18.) Victoria, in normal years, produces
less wool than Queensland, and grows no
cotton at all. But in the latest lot of Conn
monwealth statistics it is recorded to have
17 woollen, tweed and cotton mills, against
Queensland’s two. Moreover, the Victorian
factories employed 3342 persons, paidwages
amounting to £444,631, bought £1,—8,1-HI
worth of fuel and raw material, and turned
out manufactured goods valued at £2,39<,b10:
whereas the Queensland mills are such small
affairs that Theodore’s statistician doesn t
bother to give separate details of their
operations. He includes them in a motley,
collection of “hat, cap and other factories,
which miscellany, in 1921 (the latest figures
avalnble), pad £55,653 in wages, bought
£110,662 worth of fuel and raw material
and added a mere £117,762 in the process of
manufacture. In view of the fine homo


market and the prodigious local supplies of
fuel and raw material (Victoria, of course,
has to import its coal), the record of Theo-
dore’s State is unspeakably paltry. But
the manufacturer gets no encouragement to
do any better. When a Queensland company
makes a taxable profit of £IOOO, Theodore
takes £IBO of it by way of income-tax, the
rate being 3s. 7.2 d. in the £L Victoria, in
the same circumstances, is content with £SO,
Westralia with £7l 17s. od., and South Aus-
tralia with £7B 2s. Od. The Victorian tax
on incomes from personal exertion begins at
4d. in the £ and ends at 7d. Theodore’s
rates start at Od. in the £, and work up to
os. Greatly as N. S. Wales has suffered
from a succession of loan-drunk. Labor Gov-
ernments, eveu the Fuixer-Oakes crowd is
rubbing along with lower imposts than Theo-
dore’s—9d. m the £ less, in some cases, on
personally-earned incomes and over Is. less
on small companies’ profits. What is more,
N. S. Wales has no land-tax to speak of, and
Queensland has a very severe one —it gets
as much revenue from this source as the other
States put together. The fact of the matter
is that the Queensland manufacturer is taxed
up to the eyes to meet the frightful losses
incurred by the Government in its progress
towards the socialist objective. Back-
breaking burdens are imposed on him that
one lot of Labor voters may be unprofitable’
employed in the Premiers electorate, that;
another section may eat their heads off
on.the Government cattle-stations (admitted
deficit, £400,000), and that a still huger
horde, may play nap and two-up on the
once-profitable Government railways which,
having been stuffed with thousands of Labor
supporters during the war years, when every
other State railway system carried on with
largely reduced staffs, are losing between
14 and If millions a year. lie has not only
to pay his share of the £SOO a day spent in out-
door relief, but the chronic unemployed have
been made a permanent charge on his busi-
ness, and those of his companions in misfor-
tune who, being wage-payers, are regarded
as-public enemies. And he can never be
sure that the Government, in pursuit of its
mission to wipe the employer off the map,
won’t start an opposition business in the
same street or smite him with some retro-
spective tax or basic-wage enactment. The
result of it all is that the people who start
factories have got into the habit of avoid-
ing Queensland, the fairest portion of the
Commonwealth.- as they would a disease.
With reasonably sane government it would
be the first place they would think of.

The Business of Spoi l.
T. C. Adamson, of Wesley College, Mel-
bourne, made some refreshing observations
at the Founders’ Day dinner last week: —
He .wanted to see the hoys in good positions, and
he asked them seriously to consider the increased
mania tor international sport. What became of the
men who took part in it year 1 after year? A halt
should be called with regard to such competitions.
They need be held at-intervals, but not every year.
Would not, a Rhodes scholar be a better advertise-
ment for Australia ? Sport should be played only
for recreation or competition within our own boun-
daries, and that should be limited where it inter-
fered with a tnan’s career.
Two stock arguments are used in favor of
"big” cricket, “big” tennis and other forms
of internationalised athleticism—that the
contests attract more patrons to the sport,
and so improve the health and prospects of
the youth of the nation, and that they give
the nation a valuable advertisement over-
seas. Both are fallacious, and particularly
the second. In sport, as in all else, there
are advertisements and advertisements. Aus-
tralia did not benefit by the visit of the bril-
liant Griffo or the glass-jawed Bill
Squires to the U.S.A. to a thousandth of
the extent it would have done if it had been
able to send, say, one locally-built liner to
San Francisco. ; England lias been pouring
teams into the U.S. for the past quarter of
a century—-polo teams to New York, cricket
teams to Philadelphia, athletic teams to Yale
and Harvard —but the brief intimation of a
few weeks ago that the American debt was
to be paid did more for John Bull’s pres-
tige and popularity amongst the Yanks than
all Ms sporting activities. To tell the
notorious but rarely mentioned truth, all
these international contests- —whether they
take the form of foot races in which U.S.
training methods give offence to England, or
rowing events in which the Henley defini-
tion of an amateur exasperates Americans,
or Test cricket matches in which both sides
invariably grow hot under the collar —are
disruptive rather than welding in their
effects. It takes a remarkably level-headed
young man to engage in a series of public
contests in a strange land without making
himself objectionable; and that an experi-
enced elderly man is also liable to rub his
hosts, the enemy, the wrong way was demon-
strated by Archie Maclaßen during the
last M.L. cricket tour. It is doubtful if
the spectacle of the magnificoes of sport in
action inspires a single young man to go in
for a game who would not have done it any-
how ; and it is clear that Test and even
inter-State contests keep thousands in the
dyspeptic idleness of the stands who would
otherwise be playing themselves. And then
there is the damage, moral and material, that
commercialised sport does to those who par-
ticipate in it. Broadly speaking, we have
two sorts of sportsmen in our midst to-day
—the pro. who calls himself a pro,, and the
pro. who prefers to be known as au ama-
teur. Both may be amateurs, in the sense
that they have other jobs and only go in for
sport in their spare time; but the point is
that they perform for profit. Both enjoy
a measure of prosperity while they are
young; both begin to fail financially with
the approach of middle age; both have a
tendency to be stonebroke in later life. Jim
Jeffries went bankrupt a few weeks ago.
-V subscription list is going the rounds’ on
behalf of oue of the most brilliant middle-
weights Australia ever produced. Many of
England’s most famous old-time professional
cricketers are on the rocks, despite repeated
“benefits” and other money-gifts. The pro.-
amateur loses in personal moral and in pub-
lic prestige owing to the necessity of taking
his emoluments by stealth, and be usually
comes to the same end as the pro. proper.
Ao cricketing professional had more money
poured into his hands than W. G. Grace,
yet he died relatively poor. And that is
the experience of every man who tries to
make a business out of what is only safe
when if is anproached as a pastime. It is
regrettable that more school principals, do
not follow Mr. Adamson’s lead, and warn
their boys against pushing into international-
ised sport. The glamor of the foreign road
is great, but it soon fades, leaving naught
but a grey dead-end ahead.
o :
The Triumph of Disease over Charity.
The most important public question is public
health, and there is none which is in such
a state of chaos and muddle. Last week’s
furious money “drive” in Sydney drew atten-
tion once more to the tragic plight of the
great N. S. Wales hospitals. The demands
on them grow greater yearly, yet in no one
year can the public be induced to voluntarily
subscribe halt the cost of their upkeep. In
Melbourne on Thursday last the secretary
"f a movement which aims at' raising
£200.000 in order to lift Victoria’s four chief
hospitals “above mendicancy, to remove the
collecting-boxes from the streets, and to
abolish collecting on commission,” remarked
that, though Melbourne’s population was
761,000, only 7210 people could be identified
as giving £‘i or more per year to the hospi-
tals, and that the cost of every £1 collected
was 7s, Od. And what are the hospitals
doing? They are playing a part comparable
to that of a business college which teaches
none of the subjects requisite to enable a
student to make money, but only those that
show him what to do after he has become
bankrupt. Under the present system the
hospitals and the doctors who practise in
them are so busy dealing with the effects of
disease that they have no time for serious
efforts to prevent it. It is the same else-
where. On Friday a cable message .men-
tioned that Dr. Mac Eddie, of Victoria, had
found Dr. Spaiilinger, whose “vaccine
serum treatment of tuberculosis stands by
itself,” in a state of destitution: —
The production of remedies is almost at a 1 stand-
still. The Spahlinger family is . almost penniless.
He has spent all he had in his sdlf-imposed search
for anti-tuberculous vaccines.
It has been - estimated that fully 25 per cent,
of the cases that crowd into our hospitals
are there as a result of venereal disease.
Idle gravity of the situation is recognised
by tne presence of V.D. Acts in all
the State statute books, but no hospitals
and no doctors attached to hospitals tackle
the business of preventing venereal disease.
Of course, a great deal-of. good -preventive
work has been done in a haphazard way.
Sanitation has diminished typhoid and diph-
theria, though the carrier, as in V.D., still
roams more or less uncontrolled because it is
contrary to professional etiquette to de-
nounce him. Incipient T. 8., or an outbreak
of meningitis, is deplored when found, and
the attempt to defeat the enemy is vigor-
ously begun; but it appears to be no one’s
business to concentrate on keeping such ene-
mies out. And this state of affairs will con-
tinue until hospitals become what they should
be—purely State concerns, with the same
powers in regard to the dangerous sick as
the police or the military have in regard to
the dangerous well. In logic there is no
reason why we should intern a leper and
shrink from interning a syphilitic, and an
organised army of doctors is needed to pro-
tect the State from one sort of attack in
the same way as an organised army of sol-
diers is needed to protect it from another
sort of attack. The community is taxed for
the upkeep of its mental hospitals. Why
must its general hospitals depend for their
existence on mendicancy? The invariable
answer is that to put our health-defence system
on the same basis as, say, our. naval defence
system—which is where it should have been
years ago—may mean “drying up the springs
of sweet charity.” Sweet charity signifies
in this connection a horde of more or less
idle rich folk, who, while rarely, if ever,
giving according to their means to the hos-
pitals, are always ready to organise a ball
or perform a drawing-room comedy for a
hospital, or even to run a street stall on a
collection day. There is no reason why
these acts of benevolence should cease if the
State takes over hospital control from the
admittedly beaten forces of Private Enter-
prise. We shall always have the poor with
us. The main point is that national health,
like national defence, is too big a thing to
be handled by any unit smaller than the
nation, and until that truth is accepted dis-
ease, and especially preventable disease, must
prevail as it is doing to-day.
Oldi Sprats and New Mackerels.
Joseph Carruthers is a sort of profes-
sional precursor and forerunner to the N. S.
Wales Government, so it fell to his lot to
announce an approaching £6,000,000 loan for
“development.” It is as difficult to picture
a Ma State Government without a loan de-
velopment scheme as to imagine a climate
without weather. The news was broken at
Inverell, the place that is 509 miles from
Sydney by rail, and can’t afford to trade with
it, because the charges are ruinous, and isn’t
allowed to trade anywhere else, though a
port is available less than 150 miles
away. It is 21 years since Inverell was
granted the interminable line which it can’t
afford to use, the interminable Carruthers
being part of the Ministry which devised the
freak, and even before that time the district
was appealing to politicians like Car-
kuthers for the use of its natural outlet,
and getting nothing in return save silence.
But now there is a strong separation move-
ment in the north of N. S. Wales, and
veople talk of making their railways where
they please, and sending their trade where
they like, and doing without Carruthers,
and not contributing any more land revenue
to any Carruthers Government, and having
an audit and valuation when the partnership
is dissolved to find out how much or how
little debt the new State really owes when
the assets are taken into account. The
situation looks almost serious, so Joseph
the Precursor was despatched to this natural
centre of disaffection, to aunounce the
£6,000,000 loan for “development,” and add
the assurance that part of it would be de-
voted to the construction of a line from the
tableland to the coast. But there was no
definite promise that it won’t be a repeti-
tion of the existing 509-miles jest Nothing
was said about how much of the loan would
be allotted to the work. Information was
lacking as to where it would start and where
it would finish, and -when. It wasn’t
alleged that the prospective users would
be consulted in any way as to the route.
And it was not promised that the Sydney
management..wouldn’t be hostile, or that the
port, supposing the line ever reached a port,
wouldn’t be studiously neglected. Joseph
the Precursor was grieved because his state-
ment aroused a minimum of enthusiasm; but
the fact is that the north of the Ma State eveu
beats the south for its accumulation of un-
finished works and broken promises and
blighted hopes. The linking of the top sec-.
tion of the coastal line with Queensland, so
that the inhabitants may be 309 miles nearer
to a big city than they are, is a promise of
over 20 years standing, and the cranky little
gap in the railway had been nursed and
preserved since 1894. The work of complet-
ing the North Coast railway drags along like
a tortoise in disrepair. When ail is finished
the treasured gap on the border must be
closed, even if some N.S.W. people thereby
And a handy market in Brisbane, so the
finishing is as slow as Carruthers’s Million
Farms. The Dubbo-Werris Creek line, which
is essential to the North, but not to the
metropolis, is another heavy sleeper. The
Tenterfield-Casino railway, which would be
a little better than nothing as a link between
the tableland and the coast, has been pon-
dered by generations of officials in the Cir-
cumlocution Office. Surveys of routes to
make Port Stephens available are a drug in
the market. And there is an old-established
and disrespected school of politicians in the
State whose promises are a drug in the
market also. It is the ill-luck of Joseph
the Precursor that peQple seem to identify
him with this battered old brigade.
Who Is Responsible for Bertha
Coughlan?
During the hearing of wdiat is known as the
Bertha Coughlan case in Melbourne, it
became increasingly evident that malpractice
is regarded as an undisguised blessing by
many people. The police repeatedly fail in
their efforts to induce even dying victims to
implicate the guilty person; and the manner
in which the crowd—mostly womenfolk-
applauded the jury’s finding supports the be-
lief that, even granting that the accused
were innocent, the nefarious calling is able
to command a steadily expanding sympathy
from the community. The reason becomes
apparent when we learn that the average
criminal practitioner thrives largely on the
custom of married women who, for various
reasons, are disinclined to suffer the incon-
venience of motherhood. The balance of
patronage comes from single girls, whose fear
of social ostracism is far greater than any
fear of fatal results attending an operation.
The majority of stricken girls certainly
would not incur such risks were it not for
society’s heartless persecution of the un-
married mother. The attitude of both clergy
and laity in this connection is a scandal.
Obsessed with the belief that the unmarried
mother is inherently vicious, they consider
her a fit and proper person to be hounded
mercilessly into the gutter-—a procedure
'which they invariably adopt. It never occurs
to them that the habitually loose damsel is
fairly certain to be equipped with the know-
ledge to obviate any natural consequences
of her laxity. And so the thing goes on;
and the damnable persecution helps to recruit
the ranks of prostitution, and incidentally
keeps coroners busy all over the country.
Present social conditions, by placing early
marriage farther and farther beyonu reach
of the average single man, has an undoubted
tendency to aggravate the trouble. There-
fore it becomes increasingly important for
us to reduce the number of women who sub-
mit themselves to the abortionist. But
attempts in this direction will be largely
futile unless relentless blacklisting of un-
married mothers is done away. with. After
all, the girl who obeys a natural impulse is
not necessarily a sinner; at any rate, she is
immeasurably more deserving of our respect
than that ever increasing number of child-
less matrons who lavish perverted affection
on insanitary poodles.
Taxing the Toiler.
One of the commonest platform apologies
for the outrageous taxation levied in Queens-
land lies in the appeal to the audience, at elec-
tion time: “Now, look here! How much do
you pay? It is doubtful if there are half-
a-dozen people in this audience who pay any
taxation at all!” Poor flapdoodle though it
be, this imposes on many who are well-
fed and care-free; but to the unem-
ployed ' unionist it may occur that
Queensland taxation drives the employer
out of business, and in that mood the
unemployed may reflect that the man who
is out of employment is the most heavily
taxed citizen of all. Under “Toryism” in
Victoria taxation averages roughly £2 2s.
per head, while in Queensland it averaged
last financial year £4 10s. per head. In this
gigantic disproportion of burdens lies one
reason why Queensland’s unemployed have
increased in 10 years from 9060 to 33,348.
All taxation is paid ultimately, rot by the
capitalist, as the Bolshies preach, but by
industry. If you tax a man’s capital out
of him you tax him out of his means to
organise and carry on industry, and the re-
sult must be that the country will swarm
with men looking for jobs. “But look at
your wages!” exclaims the man who is pull-
ing the wool over the people’s eyes—“wages
were never before so high.” True; nor was
unemployment. Wages may be so high in
theory that in practice they don’t exist. A
dozen years ago Queensland sugar planta-
tions used to employ hundreds of men chip-
ping weeds in the off-season. To-day many
growers don’t employ a single man for this
purpose—the rate of wages makes it unprofit-
able, so it simply isu’t done. The same
thing applies to prickly-pear land on West-
ern stations. The policy of “economising”
by neglecting to keep the pear in check is
rotteu, yet managers to-day turn away the
unemployed in scores every week because the
award rates make this kind of work, in their
judgment, unprofitable. The result is that
the prickly curse goes on seoopine in
steadily a fresh million acres per annum.
The socialist cries out from the housetop:
“Unemployment is the result of Capitalism.”
As a matter of fact the decline of the num-
ber of employers in a decade by 7000 shows
clearly that Queensland unemployment is the
result not of too much capitalism but of too
little. Not fewer bosses is the need of
Queensland but more. If the industrial boss
sacks himself out of the boss industry, he. of
necessity, sacks his men'also—one result of
which is that Queensland has the highest
rate of unemployment in Australia, and
another that it spends £4SO per day in doles
to unemployed—doles which, in the end, the
employed have to pay.
The Slump in Zionism.
“Schnokkkk” puts the case for Israel:—
The article on “The Slump in Zionism'’ (It.
3/5/’,23) contains solid facts, but is. wrong- in deduc-
tions. The. Anti-Semites, on whose propaganda it is
obviously based, have all along shown an unrelenting
hostility to British help being given to the Zionist
movement, and are howling consistently tor the with-
drawal of alt financial support. In France the Anti-
Semites are similarly hostile.
It is true that the Jews who are comfortably placed
in .English-speaking countries do not want to go
to Palestine. Bnt there are others. Poland last
year provided 41 per cent, of the immigrants, many
of them Russian refugees; and the Ukraine 14 per
cent. America yielded only 2 per cent., and Britain less
than a half per cent. A local Hebrew organ, the
Australian Jewish Chuomclk, said not long ago:
“The average Australian Jew has no more, desire to
go to Palestine than he has to go to Heaven, where
he will go not one instant before he is compelled, and
even then unwillingly.” But, all the same, the jour-
nal pleaded for support for the Zionist movement,
with which probably 9b per cent, of Australian Jews
have a strong sympathy; whilst the Jews in America
and England are subscribing money in large amounts
to support “repatriation” activities in Palestine.
The main incentive is the establishment of a cultural
centre for the Jewish race; incidentally, it will over-
come the Eastern Europe “Jewish problem,” which
is caused by Anti-Semite brutality. In Southern
Russia, within the last two years, at least 150,000
Jews have been massacred. Such horrors are a scan-
dal to obviate which Europe and the world should
think some trouble is worth while.
The failure of the Jews to increase at a greater
rate in Palestine (Jewish authorities complain that
the census was very wrong, anyway) is due to the
fate of admission of immigrants being deliberately
curtailed. This is to prevent unemployment. Pales-
tine may at no time be able to accommodate ihe
15 million Jews in the world; and in the sterile con-
dition to which it has been reduced by the shiftless
Arabs, and the still more shiftless Turkish misgov-
ernment, it is a place where the rapid absorption ol
new inhabitants is a serious problem. But the
Jewish organisations are doing really marvellous Work.
Stagnant swamps' have been drained, what seemed
deserts have been planted with trees (afforestation
is being pushed on energetically), irrigation works
established, orchards and agricultural areas opened
up, factories erected, and the exports of the country
have increased prodigiously. The Jewish children
go to Jewish schools, and the Hebrew University at
Jerusalem, which Jewish students from all the world
will attend, has been inaugurated. Jerusalem has.
been modernised; amongst others, a new city, Tel
Aviv, has sprung up, electrically lighted, with fine
houses, and, incidentally, a bathroom in every house.
Also, there is not a pawnshop in the place, and the
rate of interest chargeable on capital is strictlv
limited.
The Chaluzim. is a body of volunteers on the lines
of a labor battalion. Greatly they have been recruited
from University students', who from enthusiasm have
undertaken to work as laborers for a term of years
to make the land ready for those who are to come.
There may be some “Redness” amongst them, but it
is not likely, since the “Red” who renounces his
Judaism can be prosperous in Soviet Russia or else-
where.
The Jews have brought progress to a country which
the Arabs made barren. In a stage of history when
earth-space is becoming more and more valuable, a
race that fails to cultivate its country deserves to
lose it. Australia, a prosperous and progressive
country, found difficulty in repatriating less- than
250,000 returning soldiers, many of whom had their
former places to go to. Is it; surprising that the
repatriation of a people to, a strange and desert
country should be gradual?
As a matter of policy, and to serve as a buffer
between Egypt and -possible invasion, England would
probably maintain her forces and administration in
Palestine in any ease; and to have settled there a race
that has reason for gratitude will be an advantage.
So the Zionist movement despvves more sympathetic
consideration than people who believe those fanatics
who froth at the very name of Jew- are. prepared to
give it.
The Boom in Cotton.
Last year Queensland had 7000 acres under
cotton, and the yield was 3,878,6731 b. of
seed, valued at £88,466. This year the num-
ber of individual growers has shot up from
1600 to 7000, and the area under crop from
7000 acres to 40,000; but, owing to scarcity
of rain in some parts, and, in others, bad
farming on poor-to-middling land, there will
be no million-pound output, as was pro-
phesied when the season began. The Agricul-
tural Department’s estimate is 20,000,0001 b.
seed cotton, valued at £458,333, and official
forecasts generally err on the extravagant
side. No doubt many planters will be well
ahead of it when they brake up their
accounts, but others are moodily realising the
hollowness of the belief —recklessly encour-
aged by the tribe of vote-catchers, in this as
in ail other Australian land-settlement booms
—that any novice can get a crop on any sort
of land. The mushroom growth of the indus-
try since 1920, when a mere 166 acres were
sown with cotton, has been wholly due to
guarantees. There is a Government guar-
antee, good until July 31, that the farmer
will get old. per lb. for seed cotton of ap-
proved quality, and the Government has an
arrangement with the British Cotton Grow-
ers’ Association (it lasts until 1925) where-
by the association guarantees Is. 6d. per
pound for clean lint, e.i.f. Liverpool, but
limits its losses to £lO,OOO. Theodore ad-
mitted in his Budget speech that the
940,1261 b. of seed ginned in 1921 realised less
than the guaranteed rate, but he was remark-
ably vague about it. lie managed to avoid
giving any further information than that
“any balance of the £lO,OOO will be appli-
cable to the 1922 crop.” Still, he had to
admit, as regards the future, that, “the Gov-
ernment will be carrying a very considerable
liability as regards the new guarantee,” i.e., sd.
a pound for the 1924 crop. The halfpenny
reduction suggests that a fair portion of the
grower’s return has come out of the tax-
payer’s pocket, and that suffering person wiii
be expected to pay likewise for the sudden
abandonment of" the Government’s intention
to reduce the price by another halfpenny
in respect of .short-staple varieties, the stand-
ard being .11 in. That there is first-class
cotton country in Queensland no one now
doubts. But nothing but harm can come of
the notion that cotton-growing is an easy-
money occupation for any "mug” with a bit
of land, qr the means to acquire it ; more-
over. the artful inflation of guarantees for

of Vitamins, the whole system is tuned up; nerves become
stronger ; energy is restored. The very complexion becomes
clearer; beauty is renewed.
You need Marmite because it is the richest known source of

Marmite is a pure vegetable extract, a perfect substitute for

vote-catching purposes is the worst sort of
preparation for . the day when the industiy
will have to stand on its .own bottom, as all
industries, sooner or later, must. More
science and less politics are needed if the
business is to endure. Also, it is no use
nourishing the comfortable delusion that
the Queensland Cotton-fields will always be
exempt from natural enemies. The pink boll-
worm and the cotton stainer-bug have been
discovered in Westralia, not only in cotton
plots but in indigenous plants, such as the
native hyacinth, and that over a considerable
stretch of territory. Next to the boll-weevil
the pink boll-worm is the worst cotton pest
known. It has a long way to go from North
NVestralia to Central Queensland, but eternal
vigilance, in the way of quarantine and seed
restrictions, will be requred to keep it out.

The Abomination of Desolation.
So far as it went the policy speech of Prime
Minister Bkuce at Perth was clear and
business-like—with two remarkable excep-
tions. One was the inclusion of a scheme
for subsidising the States for the making of
main roads, which isn’t the Commonwealth’s
ousiness; the other was the non-inclusion
of a promise about the South-to-North rail-
way, which is. Furthermore, the railway
is a < matter in which the Common-
wealth’s honor, if recent Governments have
left it any, is vitally involved ; and the rail-
way and the subdivision of the unwieldy
States, taken together, outweigh all other
Federal concerns at present on the notice
paper. Some extracts from the letter of a
Sydney Telegraph emissary give evidence
as to what Federal management has made of
the North, and what has to be unmade:—
The Lord never deserted Israel as thoroughly as
the shipping companies have deserted the Guff of
Carpentaria. The little wet wooden fruit-steamer
Douglas Mawson, originally built for the Nambueca
River hade, and another uncertain vessel of the
saine breed, were, a month since, the last of the
Carpentaria ships, and now the Douglas Mawson
seems to have gone. Twenty years ago boats like
the Aramac went down there, and the coastal com-
panies ran regular services of fine steamers
To-day all the bustle of the ’nineties and the early
20th century has faded. Men who have been there
recently tell me that Burketown and Normanton are
dwindling into the wild, that Croydon is failing,
Kbagoolah dead, Coen reduced to insignificance...".
All that remains of the early promise of greatness
are tumble-down cattle homesteads, some telegraph
stations, missionaries, a few legends of digger town-
ships relapsing into witlessness through loneliness
.... Sometimes it is six white men disposed about
the wharf languidly tying up ship at a cost of
Bs. 2d. per hour per man Sometimes it is a
dozen wharf laborers at the same wage, unloading
flour with every known precaution against perspira-
tion. Occasionally, by beginning work at one minute
to 8 a.m. instead of 8 sharp, they secure double
pay for the first two hours of labor, a id not long-
ago, so a ship’s captain tells me. he li id to pay
every man-jack 325. Bd. for service between the
hours of 8 a.m. and 10 a.m., of which time portion
was occupied in eating a meal pro/'ded free by the
ship.
This is the condition of things (or a frag-
ment of the condition) in a vast and valu-
able area, also Australia’s most vulnerable
area, a great part of which the Federal Gov-
ernment manages direct —from a distance
of 3000 miles or so. Another section is man-
aged from Perth—distance about 2000 miles
—and the rest from Brisbane, which is rather
nearer, but not much. The railway to the
North, with subsequent branches east and
west, is required to break the loneliness by
supplying an alternative means of travel
that will keep the passenger only three or
four days, not weeks or months, en route;
which will break the monopoly of trade
which, now that the Douglas Mawson is
gone, presumably belongs to the antiquated
little Rachel Cohen ; and to make the com-
ing and going of labor easy and speedy, so
that competition may blow in upon the local
wharf-lumper at Bs. 2d. or 16s. 4d. an hour.
It is also wanted so that people may drop
in and glance at the Territory in a spare
fortnight, and not make a half-lifetime’s pil-
grimage of it; that settlers may come on trial,
knowing that they can get away any time if
the trial doesn’t please ; to provide the place
with two doors instead of one, so that there
may be an escape in case of fire; to make
other places accessible besides the coast aPrg
which plods the s.s. Rachel Cohen; and gen-
erally to take down the sign which reads,
“All hope abandon,” etc. It is a pity the
new Prime Minister didn’t at least glance
at Australia’s biggest and most interesting
problem in his policy oration.
In a Half-time Town.
James Edmond draws a picture:—
The proposition that in future the Federal mem-
ber’s pay shall depend in part on the number
of his attendances implies a recognition of the
fact that life at Canberra must be regarded as a
piecework job. Many drawbacks must be allowed
for at ’Berra, of which lack of varied society will
not be the least. Apparently there will be no pub
at the place—at least no license has been granted
yet, and the doss-house that is in contemplation is
always spoken of as a “hostel.” So, presumably,
each member will keep his liquor unsociably under
his bed, and the more morose or stealthy kind of
member will drink alone. Politicians will have
their own company and that of a few civil servants
during the business season, but all sorts of men
like to gret away from the shop now and then, and
find life very dreary if they can’t. The manufactur-
ing and commercial men, who throng the clubs of
other capitals and scatter money freely, will he
wanting. A town with no harbor or navigable river
has few commercial chances, and it has none when
it lies between two railways (one a mere dead-end
branch), just like Camden, Appin, Cowpasture, Rob-
ertson or Kangaroo Valley, to quote some familiar
N. S. Wales examples. Even the building of cross-
country lines to run little cross-country trains on
doesn’t waken such places much. And manufacturers
don’t set up in localities where coal and iron have
to be brought long distances, and water has to be
pumped up, and water power is scarce. That jovial
soul, the land-jobber, who constitutes a popula-
tion by himself in Sydney , and Melbourne, will be
missing, along with the boniface and the barmaid,
for Canberra is Government property. There will be
no yachting for want of any place to yacht.
Where a capital is a big city, or is in the way of
becoming one, quite a number of politicians acquire
permanent residences, and run or dabble in busi-
nesses, and keep their families permanently on the
spot. In such places politics are a side-line, and
the aspect of things is much the same whether the
Houses are sitting or not. But Canberra is expected
to be really a Half-time Town, inhabited chiefly
by grass-widowers, whose families will occasionally
come along for a week or two and board, and
abandoned between sessions. A few civil servants
will be permanencies, but the bulk of them will be
in the big cities where the big work is done, and
their families will be hardly numerous enough to
constitute “society.” The local paper, the Half-
time Gazette, is likely to be a modest and unin-
fluential organ, owing to the scarcity of manufac-
turers’ and importers’ and warehouse, brewery, shop
and land-sale advertisements. They will be scarce
“NOT SUCH A BAD OLD BEAST, AFTER ALL."
for want of the people who advertise, and of the
people whom advertisers appeal to. So the inhabi-
tants will be instructed by the daily press of the
nearest city—by the Sydney Heraldgraph instead
of the Melbourne Agequs. The theatre and picture
show will probably be as good as can be expected
in the half-time circumstances.
A good deal of the free and independent feeling
that prevailed while the Federal legislature sat in
Melbourne will be lost after removal to the new
address. At Melbourne, if the wanderlust came on
a member, he could prance to the close-adjacent
station, and find two expresses and four dozen
ordinary trains to make his escape in. Or he
could get aboard his own Commonwealth liner. Or
he could board one of the private companies’ boats,
the advertisements whereof sprawl all over the front
page of the Agegps, with the proud feeling that,
as the Federal Parliament controls customs, light-
houses, light-ships, beacons, buoys, quarantine, the
navy, the Navigation Act, and fisheries in extra-
territorial waters, he was under obligation to no
outside authority. He and a casual girl could lose
themselves in the crowd. But as the Central Gov-
ernment here has no such control over railways as
in Great Britain, the United States, Switzerland,
Brazil, Mexico, Italy, France, and most other coun-
tries —being, in short, a freak, as usual—the' Federal
Minister or member in Half-time Town will be wholly
subservient to a State (and supposedly inferior)
authority for his comings and goirgs unless he sup-
plies his own means of locomotion. He is presumed
to move to Canberra in search of independence and
freedom from local influences, but on arrival he will
find himself less free than ever before and more
rigidly under outside tutelage than almost any other
politician on earth. The idea of having a separate
Federal capital district under exclusive Federal con-
trol is common enough, for the United States, Argen-
tina, Austria, Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay all possess
such a thing, but the Australian idea of a Federal
capital district which is, to a great extent, under
State control is in a category by itself.

The Happy Town.
That notable citizen Garden appears to
have come back from Moscow with mix :d
feelings, or else with instructions to be more
d.plomatic and not throw himself about so
recklessly. He says that he went to
Russia with an open mind. Yet he and his
friends cracked up Sovietism till the very
name became a weariness, and his Labor
Council affiliated with the Moscow “inter-
nationale” and became a joint in the tail
of the show. Soviet ways, he now says, may
be good enough for Russia, but they would
hardly answer in Australia. Formerly he
drew a salary for saying passionately that
they would answer, and now he will expect
to be paid for saying they won’t. He ought
to refund one of the salaries. But this is
the real old Garden :
Food, shelter and clothing are assured every Uian
willing to work in Russia, but those who are idle
do not eat Already all the light industries are
working fully, but the heavier manufactories are
onj.v gradually being established.
Another enthusiast- —Asciie, of Melbourne-
back from a similar pilgrimage, was more
gladsome than Garden. He said that his
visit to Moscow showed him that “things had
changed greatly since the days just after the
revolution. In Moscow all the shops were
open,, the trams were running and were
crowded, and the theatres were in full
swing. He spent a more enjoyable time in
Moscow than in any of the 13 countries he
visited.” But, after all, no one ever said
that the crops had failed in Moscow, where
the Bolshevik Court is, and Russia, which is
twice the size of Australia, can’t be judged
by that show city any more than an Aus-
tralian drought can be judged by Sydney
harbor. It would indeed be a foolish Govern-
ment if, with all that territory to draw
upon, it hadn’t one show city to convince
Garden and Asche with, especially as they
are so anxious to be convinced. The Gov-
ernment took a census of sorts in 1920, and
the published result was that Moscow* had
1050.011 inhabitants. As it had 1,817,100
inhabitants in 1915 it would seem that, even
if it is happy as Garden found it, or thrice
blessed as Asche discovered, tnere has been
an appalling loss of nopulation; and a place
just promoted to be a seat of government
generally grows. If either Garden or Asche
had disguised himself as a famine, or an
epidemic, or a clergyman under sentence of
deatn, or something local like that, and
roved the country in an independent way,
the results might have been really interest-
ing. As it is, this paper isn’t prepared to
accept the testimony of either of them —
even of the semi-converted Garden —as be-
ing worth much more than it was previously.
This interesting little table shows what has

It is possible for even the State to charge
too little for grazing and agricultural land ;
but, generally speaking, in Australia it has
charged too much. In particular, it lias
nearly always charged the soldier settler too
much. If a man has had a few pounds
the idea has been to get some of them, quite
regardless of the fact that the lack of the
money will often turn his attempt at settle-
ment into a failure. Australia wants few
things more than it wants its lands used;
and if it is necessary to give them away
with a pound of tea it is worth while, pro-
vided alwmys they are maintained thereafter
in full use. In the Queensland case, of
course, the question whether the lands were
previously undervalued does not arise. The
whole question is whether a contract was
broken, a scrap of paper torn up.
While P.M.G. Gibson is overhauling his
department he might hold a review of the
nippers to whom the delivery of telegrams is
entrusted A chain is no stronger than its
weakest link; and these infants are the weak
link in the chain between sender and receiver,
or supposed-to-be-receiver. It is little good
multiplying mechanical marvels to facilitate
delivery if at the end of the process the mes-
sage, along with a bundle of others, is passed
to an irresponsible boy on whom, from the
very nature of his job, it is impossible to
keep an eye, and who hasn’t been long enough
in the service to allow anybody to judge
whether he is a sheep or a goat. Any ordi-
narily well-conducted business when it sends
out goods requires the carrier to get a re
ceipt for the delivery of his parcels; but the
delivery of a telegraph message, upon which
may hang a life, not to mention large sums
of requires no acknowledgment.
In other days the messenger carried
his book, and had tb get a receipt
for ever j message; but on the plea
that receipt-books cost money that safeguard
was abolished. It is very doubtful, how-
ever whether the stationery costs as much
a« the time now spent by highly-paid officers
in inquiring into what has become of mes-
sages that have gone astray. Even if the
untested and unwatched infant has preferred
to spend his time in a little diversion, and
has got rid of his burdens by the simple pro-
cess of tearing them up, the office will have
no hint of it until a “please explain” reaches
it; and as in probably half the cases the wires
are ■ unexpected the matter never gets even
that far. As for the time of delivery, who
is to know, three times out of four, whether
the lines are to blame if, as often happens, a
message is a day or two late, or whether the
department’s infant has been too busy with
some other infant to do anything but put the
message in his pocket? The Department, in
trusting everything to these infants and put-
ting itself in a position tvkere it cannot keep
a check upon them, is not playing the game
with its customers.
“Sierra’s” recipe:—•
The systematic “sticking-up” of the Bay liners on
their advertised day of sailing is part of the price
we pay for the privilege of dangling the Common-
wealth flag over their tafl’rails. The sorry spec-
tacle of the Blue Peter fluttering down from the
masthead, and the ship snuggling up to the wharf
for another night’s snooze in port, affords much joy
to Tom Walsh and his comrades, and, incidentally,
should be entirely agreeable to the discerning share-
holders of Inchcape-’s shipping ring. Before hand-
ing the vessels over to Inchcape (which looks like
being their ultimate fate under the hampering influ-
ence of Commonwealth navigation laws and the Sea-
men’s Union), Priminister Bkuce might consider the
alternative of making London their place of registry
and final port of discharge. Irritating stop-work
meetings, job control and plain mutiny could then
be effectively dealt with under the Merchant Ship-
ping Act. Moreover, run under British discipline
and conditions of service, and paying Australian
wages, the ships would be rushed by the best class
of seamen in the Empire, and, as our seamen can
be the equal of any afloat, there is no reason why
the ships should not be manned entirely by Austra-
lians. Granted the option of leaving and signing
on in Australian ports, hundreds of seamen would
welcome the chance of breaking with the Comrades’
union and following their occupation in peace.
By the simple process of substituting the red ensign
for the Commonwealth flag, Australia may yet have
a valuable asset in the much-abused Bay liners.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Evidently Watt does not intend to become
a political cipher because he is in the chair.
The other night, in a speech at a birthday
dinner to 78-year-old Alderman Burton, he
scoffed at the idea of Parliament shutting
up because Bruce wants to go to the Imperial
Conference, and tilted at the proposal for
retaining- Federal income-tax only on incomes
over £2OOO. When Peter Lalor was Speaker
of the Vic. Assembly Gaunson quoted May
to sustain a point, but Lalor reminded him
that he (Peter) was master in that House
and not May. Watt also, it seems, is going
to judge for himself the dimensions of the
Speaker’s crease.
The Germans have made another offer to
get the French out of the Ruhr; but they
will have to bid a lot higher. At the back
of the Hun mind seems to be the idea that
all other nations except France and perhaps
Belgium are so sick of the whole business
that they might forego reparations alto-
gether. *So the proffered total reparations
amount to a trifle under the amount due to
France alone. France replies that, no matter
what the rest may do, it isn’t going to for-
give its enemy anything at all; and it isn’t
going to call "its bailiffs out until full and
satisfactory guarantees are given. Mean-
while the Hun starts wailing afresh about
his empty Treasury and his dire poverty.
What he doesn’t mention is that, through
the tremendous depreciation of the mark, the
State and every other borrower in the coun-
try have been’ practically freed from debt
amounting in the aggregate to some thou-
sands of millions; and the people who car-
ried that debt before can carry it again.
There is a way by which Germany can pay
its reparations ; but Germany isn’t going to
take that way if it can bluff out.
For the growing decrepitude of the vulner-
able North the Navigation Act is partly re-
sponsible. The Act prevents ocean-going
vessels engaging in coastal trade; wherefore
the big craft bound from Brisbane to Java
no longer stops off Crocogator River with a
few passengers and two or three tons of
miscellaneous merchandise. That trade is
reserved for the Australian coaster which
goes there on purpose; but it paid so seldom
to go to so small a place on purpose that
shipping fell off, and isolation set in, and
so people left. Then it didn’t pay the coaster
to go to Crocogator Creek at all, and the iso-
lation grew worse, and tne rest of the people
left also. The same phenomenon may be
observed on a railway. A train may stop
at a siding in the course of a 400-mile jour-
ney, but no one sends a train 400 miles merely
for the sake of the siding.
When Premier Theodore established the
proxy vote in Queensland Parliament, he
coarsely tore away a veil of polite pretence
which had seen much service. A party hack
may be only a party hack, but he used, by
being on the premises, to affect that he
listened to and voted according to the evi-
dence. When he paired he didn’t hear the
evidence, so he didn’t vote. Now in Queens-
land this sort-of-juryman just leaves a note
with the foreman saying that he will be
away for a month, and that he finds every-
body of his own color not guilty, and every-
body else guilty, in advance.
When Priminister Bruce or his Treasurer
brings up the question of stopping the issue
of tax-exempt loans, he will have to meet one
difficulty that isn’t to our credit. Most tax-
bear.ng Government securities pass from
hand to hand —the amount of inscribed stock
isn’t large—and ownership need not be regis-
tered. In other words, nobodv but the
owner need know who owns the debentures;
so a disgracefully large proportion of those
which are non-exempt don’t pay tax. The
Treasury interested pays a high rate of in-
terest, based on the assumption that it will
recover some of it in taxation, and then it is
diddled out of its rights. So far the only
suggestion put forward to get over this is
to issue tax-free loans, the Treasury thus
saving in interest, at any rate; but probably
THE MUDSLINGERS.
“The Victorian Protestant Federation is passing resolutions deploring King George’s proposed visit
to the Pope."
THE SECTARIANS: “We’re not aiming at you, your Majesty; we’re throwing at that
church. But if you will get in the way, then don’t blame us!"
if some dishonest tax-dodging financial poten-
tate were sent to gaol for three years for
fraud, the difficulty would disappear, and
tax-exempt loans would no longer have any
justification.
The latest Russian financial device is to
saw the three noughts off the end of every
1000-rouble note, and call it one rouble.
Therefore, if a man had £lOO to his credit in
the Savings Bank and A. C. Willis were to
come into power at the head of an Austra-
lian Soviet Government, the owner of that
deposit would be liable to discover that his
£lOO, under beneficent Soviet management,
had become the one-thousandth part of that
sum, to wit, 2s. But, as a matter of fact,
Trotsky’s and Tchitcherin’s notion of calling
1000 roubles one rouble doesn’t give that un-
happy banknote even that much purchasing
power. Actually, the exchange value of a
Russian 1000-rouble note is somewhat less
than one ten-thousandth part of a pound.
So if, say, the Oddfellows Lodge had £20,000
in the Commonwealth Bank, Comrade Willis
would (in the circumstances above-
mentioned) blithely inform tne members that
their credit really stood at £2O.
Dear Bulletin, —N.S.W. Rural Bank
paid per cent, for the tax-free million it
borrowed the other day, which means that
the farmer to whom the money is to be lent
will have to pay at least 7 per cent, for it
if exes, are to be covered. Yet the Common-
wealth Bank is reported to be Willing to find
the money for Martin-place extension at 5|
per cent. How is it that money is so much
dearer for production from the land than
for a city work, said work to be done by the
City Council, which has lost money on prac-
tically everything it has ever undertaken or
had anything much to do with? —Boseo.
Quite a happy Bolshevik Australia was
set out in a decision arrived at by
a union and A.L.P. Executive confer-
ence in Sydney. It was to the effect
that when unionists are on strike “fight-
ing for their rights” anybody who takes
a striker’s place and does his work shall get
at least six months’ gaol; also that full
wages should be paid (by the State) dur ng
a lockout.. Perhaps this is right. But what
if it was rounded off with a provision that
unionists who won’t work on the wages and
conditions prescribed by a Board shall like-
wise get six months at least; also that dur-
ing a strike an employer’s ordinary profits
should be kept going out of the Treasury?
That would leave the scheme a little less
lopsided.
The rush for comparatively low-priced
Government securities, especially those
exempt from taxes, isn’t altogether the desir-
able and flattering thing that Governments
are trying to make out. The rush really
implies two things: a disinclination on the
part of people with money to take ordinary
trading risks; and a distrust of Govern-
ments so far as their powers, of taxation are
concerned. Australian imports are still pro-
digious, and there is far more than enough
work in industry for all Australia’s capital
to do; but people with capital are so shy of
strikes and of political corruption and waste
and consequent taxation that they are pre-
pared to creep into almost any old hole so
long as it will give them safety.
Under the treaty that ended the war,
enemy property seized has to be used in the
first place to satisfy claims which the sub-
jects of the Allies may have against people
belonging to the enemy nations or their Gov-
ernments. The last day for receiving these
claims is May 31. The Public Trustee
(Victoria Barracks, Melbourne) is the officer
to address; but inquiries about the matter
may go to any Collector of Customs. A
claimant who has been biffed out in the past
is not barred from renewing his application.
On May 29 Lawson’s team will beat the
record of 1895 davs, put up by the first
Turner Government (1894-99), and become
the longest-lived Victorian Ministry. Only
McPherson, Bobinson, Barnes, Oman and
Clarke have accompanied Lawson right
through the pilgrimage. The other six were
picked up by the wayside. Peacock, who
took a seat 2| years ago, is one of the sur-
vivors of the Turner Ministry. Isaacs,
Taverner, Best and H. It. Williams are the
other four above ground.
After throwing what looked like a bomb
big enough to scatter the whole of Lawson’s
team, lawyer Eggleston, the elect of St.
Ivilda, explained that, although the thing
made quite a lot of noise, it was only a
squib. He didn’t want to hurt the team as
a whole, but only wished to accelerate the
departure of certain Ministers. The day
after the fizgig, or bag of wind, or whatever
it was exploded, Eggleston was hailed as a
possible alternative Liberal Premier and
the St. Ivilda tradition was invoked, but
beyond offending minor Ministers and coun-
try members, Cockies and Gnashers alike,
he has effected nothing. At the same time
it must be admitted that the St. Kilda man
has ability as well as rotundity. If lie will
acquire the knack of managing men he may
reach any height in Vic. politics.
Garden, of N.S.W. Labor Council, came
back from Russia to say -
The Soviet form of government is the only form
of government that will suit the Russians. Their
Slavonic nature will only respond to a form of
government having behind it the power of discipline.
In other words, the Slav is by nature a
serf, and must be driven, and the Soviet
form of government is the only possible
one for him, because it drives him good and
hard. There may be a pretence of Parlia-
mentary government, even as there w'as in
Rome under the dictators and early em-
perors ; but actually the slave is walloped
along the old hard road, and that is all he’s
fit for. The admission ought to about kill
the sneaking regard which some Australian
Laborites have had for Sovietism —unless, of
course, they think that Australians are really
the sort of people who should be w T alloped
by a few self-appointed bosses.
Archbishop Kelly got one in, the other
day, on the N.S.W. State education system.
It costs, he said, “twice too much,” and he
wants to know why the State’s bill for
primary instruction should run to £l3 per
head per annum while his Chtfi'ch can do
the thing for about £6 10s. Certainly the
N.S.W. system has become pretty awful, for,
though education in the Ma State lately cost
£2 per head more than the Commonwealth
average, the number of Ma’s schools was
diminishing. It lost 122 academies while
Victoria gained 188, and spent 725. more per
kid to do it. But if the law made the good
prelate pay the basic wage to liis teaching
staff he might do even worse, for it costs
something to keep a married Christian
Brother with a large family. South Aus..
however, performed the marvel of paying
secular wage-rates and yet giving “godless”
education at the Archbishop’s own price, so
he should look into the matter with a view
to economy.

“At the last Queensland Assembly election,- when
the Labor party, though in a minority of oyer
20,000 votes in the constituencies, was returned with
38 members to 34, there were 50,000 more State
than Commonwealth electors, the franchise being the
same. This time there are 63,000 more. In 1910 the

MY WEALTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The State’s debt is a sign of prosperity.. . .really
a sign of wealth.” —Queensland statesman.
When I consider all I owe,
The tradesmen who are still unpaid,
My thoughts with exultation glow
About the wealth that I have made;
For I could never owe all this
Were my affairs at all amiss.
First' take my house. When it was built
It cost in hundreds just a score;
But I have added to my gilt,
And mortgaged for two thousand more ;
So that, to-day, ’tis plain to see,
It’s worth four thousand pounds to me.
Oh, yes, I know I’m “not at home”
When duns are standing on my mat;
But often (through the back-door) roam
To search new loans “to settle that.”
At times I manage it, and so
Increase my wealth by what I owe.
Think of my doctrines what you will,
It is sufficient for my day.
The kids may have to meet the bill,
But now there is no need to pay •
And I’ve a grand, ecstatic glow
When I consider all I owe!

Disclosed net profits have climbed over
the ±OO,OOO mark, which means that with
10 p.c. divs. the Royal is storing 12s. Od. for
every ±1 it distributes. Net earnings are
treble those of seven to nine years ago, but
during the early war years the management
may have put a little extra aside on the quiet
to_ prepare for troubles .which might have
arisen in the world upheaval. But instead of
trouble, the abnormal conditions which fol-
lowed the Commonwealth’s participation in
the war gave the Royal the opportunities it
had for many years been seeking. It was a
mere infant when the ’nineties smash skittled
many of its big competitors, and in the dreary
years which followed its development was
very slow. By 1906 it was handling enough
business to justify lifting the div. rate from
6 to 7 p.c. on £150,000 of capital; in 1912
the rate was lifted to 8 p.c. on £300,000;
but three years ago payment of 10 p.c. divs.
on a half-million of capital began. The
higher rate is now being- maintained on three-
quarters of a million, and the margin of sur-
plus is steadily increasing. Since the March
balance in 1914 £450,000 of new capital has
been introduced, and, including £40,000 of
share-premiums, £335,000 of visible reserves
have also accumulated. Meanwhile the prin-
cipal P. and L. groups have expanded in this

Banking business, like all others, is more
costly to run than formerly; but as earnings
are on a much higher scale, Jls. lOd. in the
£ of the Royal’s gross profits is now net pro-
fit, compared with 12s. 4d. in 1914.
At March 31 the Royal held £5,226,064
of the public’s money, against £2,385,715
nine 3’ears ago, and the higher charges for
accommodation, etc., together with better
interest returns .on investments, explain the
rapidity with which earnings have grown.

The progress has been even better than the
figures indicate: £482,682 of the total de-
posits of nearly 2A millions in 1914 was
Government money ; at March 31 last Gov-
ernment deposits accounted for £783,908 of
a total of £4,901,578. Private deposits have
grown from £1.842,607 to £4,117,670 in the
nine years. The management has had no
difficulty in finding profitable employment
for all the new money entrusted to it, and
for its own larger funds. In 1914 43.3 p.c.
of all assets was in liquid form and 54.6 p.c.
in advances. Of the latest balance-sheet
total of 6i millions-odd 26.3 p.c. was liquid
and 71.4 p.c. advances. Put another way,
the management now has almost £3 earning
overdraft interest where only £1 was em-
ployed formerly. Meanwhile, of course, the
expansion of interests has given larger pick-
ings from exchanges.
The demands made:on the bank for accom-
modation have resulted in only £33 of every
£lOO of outside money being held liquid;
but, provided care has been exercised in
selecting securities, the stretching of credit a
few points beyond the customary “safe” pro-
portion is not of much moment. Bankers
in recent years have had daily lessons in the
necessity for caution: it is generally when
everything appears to be running smoothlv
that they are caught napping. The £3,499,1(52
of the public’s money not held in liquid form
at March 31 had the backing of advances
with a book value of £4,(587,024 and pre-
mises written down to £151,200 —-assets with
a book value of more than 275. to protect
every £1 of liabilities not covered by cash,
Government securities, etc.

One feature of the period under review was
the cancelling of the £lOO,OOO of scrip which
had been allotted to the big English amalga-
mation from which the local co. (formerly
Standard-Waygood Hercules, Ltd.) took its
name. The English concern, owing to post-
war troubles, decided not to exercise its
right to take up 100,000 £1 ordinaries (at
255. per share), and accepted £lO,OOO cash
for patent rights and agencies of its exten-
sive range of productions. This re-arrange-
ment necessitated the getting of capital
locally to enable the Australian concern to
take full advantage of the manufacturing
rights, etc. For a start £llB,lOO was raised
by 6 p.c. 10-year convertible debentures, and
£47,520 more ordinary capital with the aid
of bonus concessions in Weymouth’s, the
Melbourne subsidiary. During the past 12
months debenture-holders for £76,600 applied
for scrip in place of (heir debentures, leav-
ing only £41,500 in thaf account. Paid capi-
tal is now £361,720 instead of £284,815 a
year ago—the latter figure not including the
£lOO,OOO of scrip since surrendered by the
English co.
The Australian co. had a fairly good year,
but almost all the profit was taken to pay
10 p.c. The allowances made for deprecia-
tion, etc., prior to disclosing the £37,175 of
profit, are not divulged, but the manage-
ment announces that “the co.’s property had
been maintained in good condition,” and that
provision had been made for “all known or
anticipated losses” in respect of book debts
and securities. The two subsidiaries, Wey-
mouth’s, of Melbourne, and Standard-
Waygood, which installs and maintains
electric-lifts, have both done well, and have
good prospects. The parent co., however, is
not yet in a position to take full advantage
of the opportunities under its agreement with
the English amalgamation. It has the brains
and the plant available for producing much
of the Commonwealth’s requirements of
heavy electrical gear; but local bodies are
still disinclined to break away from their
un-Australian habit of employing foreign
labor instead of local. The Commonwealth
is practically the only country in the world
in which wages have not been cut deeply
since the collapse of the war-time boom.
Consequently, industries like those of the
E. E. of Aus. find that the present tariff
duties do not give effective protection. The
wages of skilled mechanics in England aver-
age Is. 2!d. per hour, compared with 2s. 2|d.
in the Commonwealth. But the difference
does not end there. The English cos. draw
on war-wracked Europe for cheap supplies;
there is not the same restriction on the
employment of unskilled labor —in fact, girls
and apprentices are important aids to cheap
production; and there is no limit to the
application of piece-work labor. Motors
which can be landed duty-paid at £9l would
cost around £l6O to produce locally. Com-
parisons of costs generally show that the
importer can make approximately 30 p.c.
profit by selling English gear at Australian
manufactured-cost.
The future of this co.’s enterprise in manu-
facturing heavy electrical equipment depends
a good deal on whether costs can be reduced
to a level which will enable it to compete
with the imported. article; and at present
everybody, beginning with the coal-owner
and his hewer, right along the line to taxing
authorities, appears to have conspired to
keep up costs. Alternatively, unless the co.
can convince the Tariff Board that it is
developing an industry which must be safe-
guarded in the national interest and so be
assisted oy increased duties, the immediate
future of the co.’s transformer and turbo-
alternator. manufacturing activities appears
to depend on the patriotism of users of that
gear. _ That is a doubtful factor, and the eo.
may for a time be compelled to let its plant
lie idle and take advantage of its agency
facilities with the English amalgamation.
However, in other branches of the big busi-
ness, the management should also find pick-
ings ample to give shareholders a fair return
on. their investment.

During the past 12 months estates with a
capital value of about £315,000 were wound
up and distributed, but new trusts put
£730,000 into the co.’s care. The net addi-
tion increased the total value of trust funds
to £5,206,000, a substantial holding for a
trustee co. which has been in business only
a little over a dozen years. But from the
beginning it had the backing of Elder-Smith
interests, and that assured a fair parcel of
business early in its career. The expansion
has been more notable, however, because, in
addition to competition from the E. T. and
A. Co. of S. Aus., whicjh has only a few vears
to go to celebrate its jubilee, another ‘little
trustee co., with Bagot, Shakes and Lewis
influence behind it, also entered the field
about the same time as Elder’s. The value
of estates under administration at various
balgncing-dates has been as follows:
1911 .. £53,562 I 1920 ..£3,553,763
1915 .. 1,405,146 1921 .. 4,078,224
1918 .. 2,779,039 1922 .. 4,791,056
1919 . . 3,217,709 ■ 1923 . . 5,206,000
During the past four years net additions have
averaged a half-million per annum. The co.
is already finding the business highly pro-
fitable. During the past 12 months commis-
sions amounted to £20*336-; office exes., taxes,
etc., took £16,473. That left a balance of
£3863, which, added to £4103 interest earn-
ings, gave a net profit of £7966. The direc-
tors took £270 to write down furniture, which
had cost £2093, to a round £lOOO. Paid capi-
tal is £40,000, and the year’s net profit re-
turned almost 20 p.c. For five years regu-
lar 10 p.c. divs. have been paid, and already
visible reserves almost half as large as paid
capital have accumulated.
They are very handsome results for a
young co. to show, and while they have been
partly due to the large volume of business
which has been entrusted to it, the period of
abnormal earnings—both of its _ own funds
and of trusts from which it collects regular
commission—has also helped. Elder’s
charges are on the usual trustee scale:
to 1 p.c. corpus commission, plus an annual
commission charge of 5 p.c. on the first
thousand of income, 4 p.c. on £lOOO to
£3OOO, and p.c. on anything over £3OOO.
On a £20,000 estate managed for 10 years
these charges work out at 9s. 3d. p.c. p.a.; for
20 years 7s. 2d. p.c.:—assuming in both .cases
that the corpus earns 5 p.c. For this moderate
charge the trustee co. puts experts in invest-
ments, properties, mortgages, probate, taxa-
tion and so on in charge of estates, and,
going a step further, guarantees clients
against loss by fraud or even by carelessness
in certain matters. At March 31 Elder’s
had £61,823 of funds of its own, and except
for the £lOOO of office equipment and a
couple of thousands of cash and accrued in-
terest, all its assets were gilt-edged. There
was £160,000 callable for the further protec-
tion of clients.

Paid capital is £lOO,OOO, and last year’s dis-
closed net earnings gave a return ‘of 48 p.c.
on it. It is an astonishing performance, con-
sidering that the co. started only a dozen
years ago and then had £26,368 of its £75.000
paid capital represented by goodwill. Three
years ago £25,000 was got in from a new
issue at par, but the eo. so prospered in
the war years, and also during the period of
slump and since, that reserves of £115,339
have accumulated. The co. now has funds
of £198,679 represented by tangible assets,
and last year’s net profit gave 24.2 p.e. on
that amount. The very rapid expansion of
the business is shown by this comparison of
gross profits:—
1914 ... £47,532 I 1920 .. £95,100
1917 .. 01,809 | 1921 .. 101,332
1918 . . 07,740 i 1922 . . 115,892
1919 .. 75,983 | 1923 .. 139,695
In nine years gross profits have almost
trebled; net profits have more than quad-
rupled—all with the aid of only one-third
more cash-paid capital, The past year’s net
profits may have been a couple of thousands
better than the accounts admit. For a
number of years some hundreds of profit
have been taken at each balance to write
down a building-alteration account. It had
been reduced to £2006 12 months ago, and
has since disappeared altogether.
Another view of the expansion of the busi-
ness since the issue of the first accounts
is given by this comparison of balance-sheet
figures:—
1912. 1921. 1922. 1923.
Liabilities .. £7,310 £111,504 £91,651 £90,724

Cash, etc. .. 14,728 44,158 48,965 50,192
The co. is extremely snug. Of the liabili-
ties of £90,724 at February 28 £54,400 was
a mortgage on freehold property, and only
£6324 was owing, on current accounts. The
£lOO,OOO of capital was backed by net liquid
assets worth £166,593. and property, etc,
with a book value £58,594 in excess of mort-
gages, Reserves are so large in relation to
capital that the directors will probably
sooner or later decide on a re-arrangement
which will permit div. distributions to bear
a truer relation to funds actually employed.

it used to do, but it has to be noted that
three years ago £25,000 of new capital was
introduced. Most of the co.’s business is
with the back-country, and profits vary with
the seasons. Divs. for a number of years
were very moderate; the co. was suffering
a recovery from its troubles of 15 years or
so ago, when £12,500 of capital was swept
away to write off trading losses and reduce
the book value of plant, etc., to actual worth.
Since then the management has kept a
watchful eye on book values. The position
is now very different from what it used to
be: substantial amounts have been put into
reserve, and there is now a visible £51.884
assisting the £75,000 of paid capital. These
funds should facilitate the earning of good
divs.
Here is a comparison of balance-sheet
figures over a number of years:—

Book debts are the biggest asset, and accounts
made up to the end of January each year
probably show that item at about its largest:
at that date most of the work in connection
with wheat and wool has been completed, but
Cocky has not received his cheque. Book
debts at the latest balance were larger than
in any other year, and owing to unfavorable
seasons and markets the co. was evident’y
nursing more clients than usual. Large
stocks were also held, and the management
was leaning on its bankers for £8535, had
the use of £2303 of deposits and owed
£39,391 otherwise. Book debts (less a re-
serve for doubtful accounts), stocks, cash
and other liquid assets exceeded all outside
liabilities by £83,634. After the payment
of the final div. there were surplus liquid

Westralian oil optimists had another hope
shattered the other day by the announce-
ment that Government Analvst L) r. Simpson
had found nothing in the nature of a seepage
at Rockingham, and that the only oil there
was hydro-caroon, of which traces had been
found in places where there had been a de-
composition of vegetable and animal matter.
Yarns are now being told about reservoirs
of petroleum somewhere east of Broome in
the North, and round Albany in the Smith.
In the Kimberleys, where the only genuine
and authenticated traces of mineral oil have
so far been discovered in Westralia, Freney s
and the Okes-Durack cos. appear to be satis-
fied with prospects.

The latest rush which Perth and Kalgoor-
lie are boosting is at Comet Vale, on the
Menzies railway. A lode carrying nearly
2500 z. silver and lOdwt. gold is alleged to
have been discovered, and other finds are
reported. Scores of very “rich” lodes have
been found in the West, but battery results
but an end to most of them. The Empire,
at Sandstone, which some reports reckoned
would crush several ounces per ton, is l a
case in point. The next rush will probably
be to Jones’s concessions, over some of
which two or three gambling Adelaide cos.
have already taken options and begun to
blow about their prospects.
• • • *
A crowd scratching for an excuse is the
Empire Syndicate, an Adelaide go owning
a show at Sandstone (W.A.). Sample tests
went a lot over the ounce mark, but onO
tons crushed gave only 86oz. off the plates.
Consolation stakes are to be run over a
9dwt. course in the tailing dump. Some
holders sniffed at the fact that the battery
acid-test was disappointing, and syndicate
shares which were selling at £OO .each in
February, were down to £6 in April, rsow
50s. is the quote. #
Golden Victory (W.A.) gave an option
last month over 25,000 contributing shares
at 2s. Id. per share, and the Board has since
announced that the 3d. per share received
to date will obviate the making of further
calls for at least three * months. By that
time it expects its new venture at Tarcoola
to be on the producing list. A Bulletin
man who was at Tarcoola a few months ago
doesn’t.

The original Yerranderie (N.S.W.) silver-
mine; which holds the unique, record of hav-
ing paid divs. running into six figures with-
out the stock ever being quoted on the Stock
Exchange, has been acquired by a new co.
There are 21 levels in the mine, but such
reports as are available do not indicate any-
thing of particular value below No. 13.
Prospects were not considered good enough
by the old owners to justify further expendi-
ture. What the new proprietors have m
view has not been disclosed.

Kangiara silver-lead-copper-mine, near
Yass (N.S.W.), which was one of the con-
spicuous failures (from a profit-earning
view) of the late “Captain” Taylor s three
Iv.’s group (Kyloe, Kangiara and Ivootra),
is reported to have been taken over by
Fred Tricks’s Melbourne syndicate. Ihere
are all sorts of reports as to valuable new
discoveries, but they will have to be tully
verified in working practice to cover the
complexities of the ore and the costliness ot
treatment. . ,
* • *
The results of Retaliation Reward’s pre-
liminary examination of the Great Southern
Garden Gully mine, Bendigo, which it holds
under option, seem too good to be true. Inat
a mine with such a splendid record, and
owned by some of the luckiest and shrewhest
of Bendigo speculators, should have, been
abandoned while payable ore was in sight is
almost incredible. It is stated that at the
945 ft. level the face of a rise shows sft. ot
quartz carrying payable gold. At Hitt, a
level going south is in “leg stone from 3 to
9 inches wide “showing fine gold. A .
level south is being continued, “as formation
will enlarge and will command formation tor
vertical height of 300 ft. and hundreds of
feet in length.” As indicated m The Bul-
letin recently, local practical opinion p ns
its faith on what exploration will disclose
at 1500 ft. —the lowest depth at which any
lode has been worked.
• * • *
The fall of nearly £1 in New Blue shares
last week indicates either that the prospects
of this Bendigo mine are not as good as they
have been persistently represented to be, or
that present-day local speculators have not
the punch or pluck of the old timers. In
justice to the management it has to be stated
that it was officially notified that owing to
the necessity for tilling-up stopes in the
richer section of the formation last week s
return would show a b;g falling off; still,
the return was an excellent one, oil) tons
yielding 46i)oz. gold, and a dividend of Is.
per share was declared. That distribution
was the eighth for the current year, total-
ling 11s. (id. per share (£25,875). Bears
were badly knocked over this stock about
15 months ago; some of them have not jet
recovered from the shock which the ioine
itself gave them, and it is hardly likely that
they would renew their operations unless
they had reason to believe that there is some-
thing doubtful (or more than that) ab-Ait
prospects. It is now admitted that tor a
considerable length the main south-level ia.'
been in a blank, and that the advancing
stopes have reached it. It is assumed that
the level is on the base of a wave-like roll,
but that rising will reveal the pay-ore above,
and that further driving will locate it m
another trough.

Ulster, Bendigo,, looks like redeeming early
promises with developments at 150011. L re-
gressive work has established the existence
of a continuous bodv of ore going north, and
its average is reported to be highly Pay-
able. The run of gold has been proved lor
a height of 35ft. over the level, and the
bottom shows “good gold lor the tulUen o th.
Eldorado, Gaffney’s Creek (Vie.), considers
that better things are ahead. Driving along
the dyke a floor of quartz was cut which
looked aS if it might open out like one ot
the old-time makes. With quartz still mak-
ing into the big diorite basin, anything may
happen. What Eldorado wants is a supply
of working capital to open up in the basin on
a decent scale. Now it just chases luck.
* * * *
Mt. Morgan has taken an option over the
Ajax copper-mine. Discovered three years
ago, it was considered the best surface show
unearthed for some time. , It is about eight
miles south-west of Bajool,, the railway
junction for the Port Alma line. Although
A. A. Boyd speaks of it as speculative he
is probably satisfied that he is on a good
chance. L. 0. Ball reported on the show
when it was opened up in 1921, and some, oi
his assays were impressive. The crop is rich
carbonates and glance, and a sample assayed
29 6 p.c. copper. More significant was an
average test of the 15ft. wide formation
which went 8.6 p.c. copper. Along the line
of crop Ball noted a width of 35ft. of gossan,
which he considered so impressive m bulk
and character that “thorough testing should
be undertaken immediately.” But that was
in 1921, when copper was at a low ebb, and
the mine was forced to seek exemption. Now
it should have its chance, and Arthur Boyd
can be reckoned on to search for enrichments
under the gossan cap.

Beaudesert (Q.) can still supply oil thrills.
The latest is the report that two samples
sealed down in the presence of the Govern-
ment Geologist have been tested by the Vic-
torian Mines Department, and that they are
the dinkum oil. They came from two hand
bores, presumably at a very shallow depth,
and on land taken up by the Australian Oil
Corporation. Practically all the Queensland
State geologists have been on the area. Jen-
sen, St. Smith and Reid have published
reports on its oil possibilities, and none of
them is optimistic.

After much travail, considerable cash back-
ing from shareholders and liberal assistance
from the Government, the Billy Hughes Co.
seems to have been let down bv its. Frederick
mine, at Normanby (N.Q.). There are, some
patches of good ore, but a large quantity of
poor grade; and the lot does not average up
to the mark. A few returns may be got
from the mine, but on present appearances
a lot of cash will be dropped. Govt. Geolo-
gist Morton, who helped the co. along with
advice, can disclaim all, responsibility for
the present position, as his opinion was that
the co. should try the Billy Hughes, Ross
Smith and other reefs.. The battery on its
present site is no use to those shows. Ihe
hopes entertained a year or more ago for the
Normanby revival are for the present as
ashes of roses.
* * * *
The Canary, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.), last
week reported one of its best strikes: 3ft. of
40 p.c. ore was uncovered in the winze from
the 82ft. level. The original option expired
last month, but it is reported that the term
been extended to the end of this month.
The latest strike may decide the option-
holders to take over. It’s all a matter of
price, the terms being stiff. Jack Lennox
is on velvet' either way, as there is over
£2OOO snugly in the bank from pnst crush-
incs, and he has already had £lOOO for the
Option. In addition there is probably 100
to 150 tons of tin waiting to be taken out.
The “Wild Cat” expressed the op’nion a
couple of months back that the Canary,
although very rich, would not develop the
tonnage that the Sardine is likely to have.
It still looks like that.
Sardine North does not get beyond the
prospector’s-show stage, and nothing like
the Sardine shoots have been picked up,
although the formation has been driven on
pretty well to the boundary. The idea is
now gaining ground that work has not been
on the Sardine formation at ail, but probably
on a footwall lode about 40ft. behind it. The
manager is going to look in the hanging-wall
country to test tins theory. If it turns out
trumps Sardine hsorth has good prospects of
becoming a mine.
No. 4 North Phoenix, Gympie (Q.)., made
the pace a cracker last year, but it was too
hot to keep up, and the last two crushmgs
have been disappointing. It has just cleaned
up 100 tons for 960 z., so it is clear that there
are some b.g barren patches. Some of the
smaller shows have been getting on to speci-
men stuff; North Smithtield's won 103 oz. from
seven tons, and a couple of prospectors got
550 z. from 7cwt. from the Phoenix Golden
File. The former slipped £3OO into the
hands of its syndicate.
There has been little to lighten the gloom
at Charters Tdwers (N.Q.) lately. Clark’s
winze from No. 10, down 71ft., got 4in. of
light stone, and the No. 11 North has been
driven 520 ft., the end showing a little stone.
Drilling at the Rainbow is expected to reach
its objective this week, and a new bore will
be started immediately. There’s a feeling
on the Towers that it will probably be the
last with the present plant. A small quartz
formation was cut last week at 350 ft., but it
was reckoned of no importance.
11. I. Jensen, who has been a free-lance
geologist since he stepped out of the Queens-
land Geological Survey to fcontest a seat at
the last Federal elections, has just been in-
vited by the Tewantin (Q.) people to sum up
their chances of striking oil. The last heard
of the venture was that heavy water had
been struck at 140 ft., with traces of oil.
* * * *
Bowen State mine is now turning out
about 7000 tons of coal a month. _ Jim Con-
way, with State funds behind him, is mak-
ing it a well-equipped show, and has ambi-
tions of a 1000-ton-a-day output, although
this figure will depend on the demand. The
main endless-rope haulage has been in opera-
tion over four months, and an electrically-
driven haulage winch has just been installed.
The hoppers at the mine are right over the
trucks on rail. The price is 16s. a ton.
The Consolidated is busy on the Garrick
seam, driving on coal and installing extra
plant. The output is small yet —running
about 700 tons a month.
Development work at Federation tin,
Ileemskirk (Tas.), is opening up some nice
ore. A new lode has been cut on the eastern
section, assays going 13 p.c. over 2ft. Trench-
ing on the southern area has also exposed
some high-grade stuff. The co. was unfor-
tunate not to have secured sufficient cash
to go ahead with the original policy of equip-
ping the show with the 40-head battery, as
everything points to the property becoming
a big producer of tin when it has been de-
veloped and connected with the mill. An
attempt was made a few months ago to re-
issue the large block of shares forfeited in
the slump period, but the result was dis-
appointing. It is now proposed to issue
£25,000 of debentures to bring the show to
the producing‘'stage. The existence of ore-
shoots over a large area, and first-class water-
power and mine-timber at hand, should give
the Federation a capital chance to make
good. One of the present troubles is that
the co. is endeavoring to cover too much
ground with funds available, and in. this
respect engineer J, B. Lewis has exhibited
undue optimism. The show requires a large
capital and is worthy of it.
• * * •
Concerning a Speck resurrection: —
Reference to the mine’s records makes it appear
more than “passing strange” that a Bendigo syndi-
cate should give a thought to the resuscitation of
the derelict Tasmania gold-mine at Beaconsfield. It
was opened in 1877 by a local co. which in 20 years
mined 299,000 tons ore for 371,4080 z. gold by amal-
gamation alone, equal to 24.84dwt. per ton. In the
next seven years 198,850 tons were crushed for
199,435 oz.; 15.87d\vt. per ton were won by amal-
gamation and 4.6Bdwt. by chlorination. The total
value of gold won by the local co. was £2,094,838
and £772,072 was paid in divs.
In 1903 the mine (then 800 ft. deep) was acquired
by an English co., which equipped it with an up-to-
date plant. In 10 year 3 524,842 tons were treated
for £1,071,414 worth of gold, but no div. w3s paid.
There was a gradual decline in the yield from
16.2dwt. in 1904 to 7.Bdwt. in 1913, and the return
from amalgamation fell from 13.25dwt. in 1904 to
4.l6dwt. in 1913. The mine had been deepened to
1500 ft., and manager Heathcote advised that the pros-
pects did not warrant any further expenditure in
deeper exploration. Arthur Llewellyn, on behalf of
John Taylor and Sons, made a thorough investigation
and agreed with Heathcote. The co. decided to dis-
continue operations, but the Tasmanian Govt, stepped
in and made arrangements to assist a party of work-
ing-miners to run the show on a co-operative basis.
This test was a conspicuous failure. Bendigo Cundy
and the late J. H. Fawcett were then engaged by
the Govt, to make an investigation, and they must
have submitted an adverse report, as nothing further
was done with the property except the dismantling
of the magnificent plant.
The representation now seems to be that the only
difficulty is the heavy inflow of water, and it is
asserted that with electric-power to run multiple
pumps this can be controlled at comparatively small
cost. The detailed reports of Heathcote and Llewellyn,
however, leave no doubt as to the real trouble being
the shortening of the pay-slioot from 1200 ft. at the
800 ft. level to about 300 ft. at the 1500 ft. level, and
to the increasing refractoriness of the ore.
* * * *
Briseis (Tas.l produced 20 tons tin-oxide
in March, but operations have been hampered
by the drought. Since the diversion of the
Kingarooma River was completed, 11KJ,UUU
sq. yd. have been treated for 72 tons oxide,
which compares very favorably with thelast
output prior to the diversion: 160,000 yd.
for 73 tons. When the dry spell breaks some
good outputs can be expected from the old
property.
.* * * *
An English co. with a capital of £20,000
has purchased the copper-nickel show at
North Dundas (Tas.). The ore is reported
to run 9 p.c. nickel and 5 p.c. coppei. J-he
war shut down this mine: the output used
to go to Germany for treatment.
“** * *
Good progress has been made with the
equipment of the Leona (Tas.). and tin-
winning should commence when sluice-water
is available. The show is mostly Launceston-
owned.
* * * *
B. V. Barton’s report on Waria River, New
Guinea, is a knock-out. His assistants
reported results at about 3d. per yd., but his
own examination shades values from a
ha’penny to a maximum of 3d. So he pro-
nounces the show a duffer. John Brandon s
followers do not intend to haul down the
flag till another expert inspects. The Ger-
man engineer’s report is the lure.
• * * *
Thompson’s, of Castlemaine, have been given
the job of constructing a dredge with a
capacity of 100,000 cub. yd. per month for
Tongkah Compound. The dredge is to be
of the revolving cutter type, and is to tackle
a 229-acre block at Selangor (F.M.S.).

“Royal”: One of Barwell’s boy-immigrants

to tell his friends that the streets of Aus-

Walking with an Aussie friend down
Rundle-street, Adelaide, the day after his

retrieving the headgear he found a dirty
pound-note beneath it. His friend told him
he ought to take a ticket in Tatt.’s; and on
the Pommie inquiring what that was, the
friend led him to the nearest communieate-
with-Hobart shop and superintended the in-

benevolent Australian Government’s 14 per

“Yarrum”: Game Australians? I over-

mother and three youngsters, ranging from
a tot of 3 to a big boy of 13. All their
worldly possessions, with the two little
youngsters, were in a shandrydan pushed,
alternately, by the other three. The horse
had “given out” near Yerong Creek, and
they were making for Tenterfield, where
father was to “work on the corporation,”
and Edgar was to go to school, “to complete
his education.” Dad hadn’t seen a news-
paper since he left “Jindera, on the borders,”
just befoi'e the Federal elections. Some-
body had told him that Billy Hughes got
in for Morth Shore; and he supposed they’d
soon have the bridge, as Billy was the man
for the job. He used to take an interest
in politics, until he found “the game wasn’t
worth the candle.” They expected to reach
Tenterfield in three weeks, and they wouldn’t
be sorry, as the boots were worn off their
feet with the pushing.

show that he has a hundred curious ways of
gathering victims. A party of three, motor-
ing near Wellington (N.S.W.f, ran over the
end of a heavy billet of wood. It flew into
the air like a youngster’s “tip-cat,” and,
curving over, shot like a spear through the
hood into the car. That none of the motor-
ists was impaled only showed that Death
wasn’t in a serious mood just then.

effort of painful
dentistry. W h y

s o backward i n
honoring the big
men who did big
tilings for the coun-
try? Alfred Dea-
kin has had a
small bust placed
in the vestibule of
the Vic. State Par-
liament House.
There is no name

sembles Charles
Dickens than Aus-

tongued orator. No-
thing has been
done to perpetuate
the in emory of
John Forrest, a
truly great ex-
plorer, and the big*
gest statesman so
far born in Austra-
lia. Captain Cook’s
first landing was
utterly ignored in
Melbourne on April
28, and this great
navigator, who
placed every naffive-
bo r n Australian
under a personal
obligation to him,
has no storied urn
or animated bust
in the city’s
streets.
“D.”: There is no equity in this street-
collection business. One of my friends —-call
him Smith-—is generous, but shy. He has
never addressed a barmaid as “Kiddo” in his
life. The approach of a grinning bevy of
female collectors causes him an agony of
embarrassment. He confusedly unloads an
assortment of pennies, sixpenny bits and
shillings on them, and flees, oniy to be at
once marked down by another bevy. No
collector who knows her business allows a
citizen of the Smith type to pass. Now
take the case of Jones. Jones is large, noisy,
flamboyant, self-assured, and in his element
when engaged in badinage with strange
females. He does little or no work on
Hospital Days. Provisioning himself with
a pocketful of pennies and half-pennies, plws
a few thrippenees for exceptionally alluring
girls, he goes forth with the air of a con-
queror. Any young woman who secures one
of his coins has to earn it in the form of a
"HAIR, HAIR!”
“What on earth are you growing a moustache fort”
"Oh, well, you know, a fellow ought to have a hobby of some sort ”
torrent of raillery, designed to present him
as a dashing humorist, and, if she greatly
attracts him, an invitation to dinner. Smith
spends 10 times as much in his efforts to
give unobtrusively as Jones does while
blazoning his wit, gallantry and thrippenny
bits to the world, and would be glad to pay
as much again for the blessed privilege of
being left alone altogether.

“Zimra”: Most political hecklers come a
cold thud sooner or later. “Squeaky” Smith,
of Ballarat, used to inspire fear among those
whose meetings he attended, for his queries
were searching and his implications trenchant.
One evening, in search of
amusement, “Squeaky” hit
Creswick, where Peacock is
wont to spread his tail, and
S’Ralec had hardly taken the
platform before shrill fal-
setto hurled an X-ray ques-
tion at him. Pretending not
to hear, the orator went on.
The query was repeated, an
octave higher. “Would that
lady kindly speak a little
louder?” flashed Peacock.
And the audience’s roar
nearly drowned the famous
laugh of “Squeaky’s” sup-
pressor.
“Wilfrido”: The police
usually keep a vigilant eye
on empanelled jurors, but
now and again they crash
heavily. A case in point
occurred the other day in
Maoriland. The charge was
sheep-stealing, and the
Crown Prosecutor, noticing
the attitude of the foreman
of the jury, thought#he had
already; made up his mind
concerning the guilt of the
accused. To his surprise,
however, a verdict for an
acquittal was brought in—
mainly, as lie subsequently
discovered, through the in-
sistence of the foreman that
the prisoner was the victim
of a conspiracy. Soon
afterwards the C.P. dropped
in on the criminal sessiohs
of a lesser town, where he
was spending a few weeks’
holiday. The man in the
dock was the foreman of the
sheep-stealing case ! “He’s a
bad egg named Bill Blank.”
said the chief detective* ‘‘and he’s twice been
declared an habitual criminal.”
“Hamer”: Hats off to Bent-street, Pad-
dington, a Sydney suburban thoroughfare
that boasts some 20 houses! Every house-
hold had its full man-strength in the A.1.F.;
and when the list of casualties of “the Land-
ing” came through seven of the twenty were
thrown into mourning.
“Te Pana”: The naming of the big tunnel
through the South-
ern Alps, which is
to serve as a traffic
link between the
east and west
coasts of the South
Island of Maori-
land, has provoked
a controversy that
is melting the snow
for miles around.
On the East Coast
the hole commences
at Arthur’s Pass,
and it runs in a
straight line for
5i miles and hits
daylight in the
Otira Gorge, on the
west. Otira Tun-
nel has been a
working title,
although when
lous e p h Ward
christened the bab.v,
years ago, Arthur’s
Pass, was the name
tacked on. The
natives on each
coast are in fierce
ferment about it.
demanding that
their claims for
naming shall be
heard, and as the
tunnel is due to be
officially opened in
June, day by day
in every way the
argument grows
bitter and bitterer.
The chances are
that ole Bill Mas-
sey will settle the
dispute by naming
it Reform or some-
thing pleasant like
that.
“Te Pana”: My paper-chasing, “lead-
swinging” soldier wasn’t so lucky as “How-
itzer’s” (B. 12/4/’2.3). During a term of
instruction work in C.L. Camp, Tauhereni-
kau (M.L.), 1 witnessed a signature to the
discharge of a little bit of a man who had
been chasing pieces of paper about the camp
for months. The heads were still a trifle
suspicious as to whether his “rat” was din-
kum, and as he went through the gates en
route to Featherston, to hand in his kit, a
sergeant was detailed to keep an eye on him.
A wild easterly was sweeping the plains, and
A NICE DRY BIT.
“Brown left his son anything?”
“Rather!”
“What?”
“Stranded.”
rubbish and discarded newspapers fluttered
around in clouds. But, feeling safe at last,
nary a bit of notice did the “discharged” one
take. Whereupon he was recalled by the
sergeant, and I saw him in Christchurch a
few days ago wearing a returned soldier’s
badge and an empty trouser leg.

A PLEASURE TO COME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The marvellous choir reminded one of the angels
singing.” —Premier George Fuller’s lady on a royal
wedding at the Abbey.
I have heard the cats at midnight make disturbance
of my rest;
I have heard the breezes whisper through the trees ;
And ofttimes, on an outing, I have hearkened to the
“shouting”
Of a cobber crying, “Order what you please.”
I have heard a wail of wheezes stealing softly from
my chest
When it felt the woeful winter’s icy sting,
And to soaring larks I’ve listened when the morning
dewdrops glistened. . ..
But as yet I’ve never heard the angels sing.
I have heard a raucous merchant vending mussels in
the street,
And an orator who doped niv commonsense,
And the ripple of a streamlet has bewitched me in a
dreamlet,
As l dozed beneath the shadow of a fence;
I have heard the voice of Melba singing marvellously
sweet,
And the splashes of the stones I used to fling
In a fairy-like lagoon, ’neath the placid harvest
m00n....
But as yet I’ve never heard the angels sing.
I have heard the bishop preaching in a minster
long ago,
When he spoke about a life beyond the grave;
I have bought some urchins marbles who’d delighted
me with warbles
As I occupied a seat adown the nave;
AND THE WORLD SMILED AGAIN.
LADY: “Haw. can you — er—cook sponge-calces?”
COOK : “Yus, madam.”
LADY: “Oh, I am to relieved; yon know, Rupert is so particular
about his sponge-cake—aren’t you, dear?”
Their surplices gave promise of a plumage white
as snow;
Of the flights of blessed seraphs on the wing
I have read in verses pretty; - from the pen of Dan
Rossetti....
But as yet I’ve never heard the angels sing.
Oh, the luck of. Mistress Fuller to have recognised
the noise
Of choristers whose anthem she discussed !
Can a person deaf- ? and blinded ever hope, to he
reminded
Of the music mortals mostly take on trust?
After joyful resurrection I may meet those Abbey
boys, . . >
And answer to the solemn Sabbath ring
Of the holy bells of Heaven, for a service at eleven
But as vet I’ve never heard the angels sing.
VICTORIA.

“Delver”: It used to be a fixed idea in
the Ma State’s Government departments
that the Public Service Board w T ould never
engage any female fair to outward view.
But a change has been noticeable since the
war, and nowadays many good-looking flap-
pers of the perfumed and powdered variety
brighten up the lairs of Bavin’s pet aver-
sions. The boss of one of these lairs is a
fierce wowser. He has been trying hard
for _ some time to get a skinny, hard-faced
typiste, one who doesn’t wear decolletd
blouses, etc., but his efforts have been in
vain. The latest arrival in bobbed hair
and suede shoes sauntered into my room the
other morning, and inquired what sort of
a bird the old cove was. I wanted to know
why she inquired. "Well,” she said, “the
silly old goat sneaked into my room yester-
day after you’d all gone, and I was putting
on my hat, and what do you think he gave
me?” I assured her I had no idea, but hoped
it wasn’t a kiss. “No,” she said disgustedly,
“a tract!"

“Sixenate”: Something sensible was said
by Dr. A. W. Campbell, in evidence before
the N.S.W. Lunacy Commission, when he
HOPE FOR THE COLOR-BLIND.
FIRST GENIUS : “Hoic do you think I could improve my
color, old man?"
HIS RIVAL : “Well, you might try Hickson's treatment.”
advocated that not only should discharge
from asylums for the insane be made easier,
but admissions as well. The Lunacy Law
reformers seem to be concerned only about
release; but the difficulties put in the way
of admission have probably caused more suf-
fering. A woman in Goulburn was recog-
nised hy all her relations as mad on one
point; but as she “merely had hallucinations
about the conduct of her husband” it was
impossible to get her placed under re-
straint. Her particular madness occasioned
so much misery to everybody, herself in-
cluded, that her suicide came as a relief.
An M.L.A. was troubled for years in the
same way. The lady’s visits to the blouse
were almost nightly ; and she was well enough
supplied with funds to make trips to his
country electorate to blackguard him there.
Yet it was only when she had attempted to
drown herself and her children that she was
treated as insane. This form of mental
sickness has ruined the prospects and happi-
ness of many a family ; and the incongruous
thing is that some much saner people can be
put away quite easily.
“Cy Cyclone”: The winds and waves con-
spired to give Christianity a
fillip amongst our brown breth-
ren at Nauru on Good Friday.
For some weeks all shipping
had been held up by rough west-
erly weather. A few days be-
fore Easter the seas became nor-
mal, and to hasten the despatch
of one of their steamers the
powers in the phosphate indus-
try decreed that the Kanaka
boat-boys should work on Good
Friday (at overtime rates, of
course). The Kanakas, how-
ever, discovered religious
scruples, and paraded in force
to the Administrator. That
official declined to interfere, but
fit, the last moment the elements
arrayed themselves against the
ungodly. Early on Good Fri-
day morning a fierce westerly
lashed up such a sea that load-
ing cargo was out of the oues-
tion. The Kanakas were jubi-
lant. Their own summing-up
of the matter was: “Jesus
Christ the Friend along Caroline boys. He
send big seas. Boats no can go out. Jesus
Christ He savvy too much!”
"Tally-ho”: It sounds like the echo of an
O. Henry story, but it actually occurred in
the Speck the other day. A husband of 60
who had spent a considerable sum on obtain-
ing a decree nisi against his wife called in
to see the respondent’s solicitor two days
after the diecree was made absolute, and paid
a bill of hers. “Why are you paying this?”
asked the lawyer. “I thought you were
divorced the other day.” “Yes* we were,
admitted the old chap. “But we had been
living together for 40 years, and during
the last six months we couldn’t stand the
loneliness. So we got married again yester-
day.”

“Schnorrer”: Jewish charities probably
hold the record in cheaj} administration. In
Sydney Jewry is a Women’s
Clothing Association, which
collects garments and the
like from Yids who can spare
them, and distributes the
same amongst those who are
too poor to buy them. Be-
sides this it purchases
material and makes such
necessary. articles ■of apparel
as are not provided by gifts.
Last year the management
expenses of the useful guild
ran to a whole 12s.—and its
job is no less than to see to
it that no Jewish family
lacks clothes or blankets in
winter.
“Jazzbo”: Re “Sykes” (B.
26/4/’23) on the accomodat-
ing credulity of French and
Italian railway officials. One
night in February, 1919, a
party of four of us from the
Corps Central School at Rue
boarded the express for
Paris. We had neither passes
nor tickets, but at 5 next
morning, when we were
rudely awakened by the
French “flying gang” with
“Billets, messieurs!” one of
the party thoughtfully pro-
duced an elaborate dance-
programme which had been
specially printed for a fancy-
dress ball at the school. It
was an imposing document,
with the corps’ colors (black
and white) threaded through
the side sof it. Two mem-
bers of the “gang,” after
gravely inspecting it and rea-
soning together, were mani-
festly impressed. “Bien,
messieurs,” was the ultimate
verdict, and “bien” it was —for us.
From a city consulting-room:—
Sadly I read that 96 more medical graduates
bloomed in N. S. Wales last month. The Lord
knows how half of them are going to earn a living.
There is no money in Medicine on the scientific side
—the study of tropical ailments and the like—and
the same‘ is true of mental diseases and public health.
Most of the 96 will have to seek openings for general
practice, and these are becoming rare even in remote
country townships. There is a plethora of doctors
in towns with a population of 2000 or more, and the
city and suburbs are simply out of the question.
Travellers for firms selling drugs and instruments
tell strange tales of the shifts .to which the new-
comer is put in the effort to gain a footing, and of
the tactics adopted by old nattds to checkmate him.
It has become a common practice for established
men to form combines of three or four —six in one
particular suburb—with the object of making it too
hot for any new arrival. All the takings are pooled,
and one of the partners is always on duty. To
compete agair.st the entente cordiale Dr. Newbroom
would have to lead a hermit’s life, or he wouldn’t
be called in at all. If he took a day off, patients
would aver that he was always out, and would seek
advice from one of the others. Then he would find
THEIR COMMON PURSUIT.
“I hear that Jessie’s new husband is interested in ancient excavations."
“That will suit Jessie. She always teas a terror for digging up the past."
the combine shy of giving anaesthetics for him,
reluctant to meet him in consultation, difficult about
helping him with “ops”; in fact, anxious only to
see the last of him. And the odds are 10 to 1 on
his being crowded out.
You can’t altogether blame the men who fly to
these desperate expedients. They have to do
something to prevent undue competition and secure
a living for themselves and their families. When
similar conditions obtain on the wharves the union
closes its books. That resource is denied to the
members of an overcrowded profession, but there will
be more of these unofficial combines if the schools con-
tinue to pour out graduates 90 or 100 at a time.
“Ess”: Fatty and Greasy arc rival but-
chers in a little Richmond River town. Many
customers give them month about, the meat
being delivered by a mounted youth who has
grown lopsided through constantly carrying a
heavy basket on one arm. On the first day
of the month Fatty and Greasy go round for
orders themselves, galloping hard from house
to house, each expecting to get a little of the
business that should go to the other. It’s
an early morning butchers’ race for an extra
customer or two. The clatter the pair make
on the roads leading out of town is an un-
failing sign that a new month has come, and
they vary the course by dashing across pad-
docks to navvies’ camps and timber-getters’
depots. Sometimes they reach a house simul-
taneously, each abstractedly ignoring the
other’s presence. Generally Fatty, being a
better rider, has the advantage of Greasy.
But the other morning Greasy took a pad-
lock with him. Fatty hustled down to a
house that stood a good bit back from the
road. Instead of riding close on his heels
as usual, Greasy locked the gate. Thereafter
the race was his.
* * * *'
“Ten-and-six”: The Bar is not often able
to go to law with the Bench; but Hogan,
an Adelaide lawyer, recently obtained from
the S.A. Supreme Court an order re-
quiring Halcombe, S.M., to “hear” him-
which the Beak in question had refused to
do unless the counsel apologised for some-
thing that had happened on another occasion.
A sentence from Hogan’s affidavit throws a
light on the situation:—
It is not true that I was abominably rude, or at
all-rude, to Guy W. Halcombe on any previous occa-
sion ; although it is true that he, on a previous
occasion, was very rude to me, and among other
■things said to me in, open court, and in the presence
of reporters, “You young pup!”
The Court was unanimous that Halcombe,
sitting as S.M., could not resurrect some-
thing that had happened when he was sitting
as a P.M. Ordered accordingly that Hogan
shall be “given audience” whenever he
appears; with 10 guineas costs against the
magistrate. But the practical Judge Gordon
took occasion to remark that some junior
members of the Bar do, wrongfully and un-
accountably, show less respect to an S.M.
■than to‘ a Judge.
* * ■* *
“Experto Crede”: The counsel who strings
cases out where the money is good has a way
of falling in when he meets an adversary
of the opposite description. I was chief
witness in a big property matter. For weeks
I had been amassing reasons to show that the
land and buildings in dispute wefe wrnrth
£25,000. Our long-winded leader put me in
the box, and suggested dozens of subjects —
all more or less irrelevant to the real point
at issue—for me to discourse upon to the
jury. At the dead end of it all he inquired,
apparently as an afterthought, what figure I
valued the property at, and I told him, hop-
ing naturally to be asked my reasons. 1
discovered afterwards that he expected his
leai’ned friend on the other side to drag them
out in cross-examination. The friend was
not such an ass. “I’ve no question to ask
Mr. Crede, yer ’Onner,” he muttered, half-
rising from his seat. “I think the jury will
agree that my friend, Mr. Howl, has ex-
hausted the subject.” In his address the
perfidious lawyer traversed the evidence of
the other witnesses, and then turned contemp-
tuously to me. “Mr. Crede,” he said, “val-
ued the property at £25,000. No reasons, no
facts, no figures given. Just said £25,000 and
left it at that. He might as easily have said
£50,000 or £lOO,OOO. I ask you, gentle-
men, what credence can you give to an off-
handed statement of that description?” Their
verdict was the answer We crashed—
bumped clean out owing to a K.C.’s ability
to hold his tongue.

“Andy”: Our washerwoman was speaking
disrespectfully of a party she disliked, and
after spending a few minutes on a brief out-
line of his general shortcomings, wound up :
“ ’Nd ’e’s that illegitimate ’e can’t write ’is

a mere malapropism or a shrewd statement
of fact.
THOUGHTLESS
OF HIM.
THE MAN (after his dismissal): "Of course.
I love you. Haven't I spent every penny
I possessed on you? Why. I would die
for you."
THE CIRL: "Well, you should have thought
of that before."
“N. Me”: An accused person giving evi-
dence on his own behalf in a Sydney court,
the other day provided an interesting example
of the neglected art of mnemonics. He
dated the beginning of his financial down-
fall “from the week Smith’s Weekly
stopped attacking the Kirkpatricks and the
Commonwealth Bank.”
THE INFERNAL TRIANGLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A message from Vienna says that a woman sur-
prised Herr Musbruck, a magistrate, by asking
whether she was married to one man or twins. She
explained that she had a civil and a religious mar-
riage on different days, and believed she had been
married to the same man, but lately, when her
husband returned from journeys between Berlin and
Vienna, she noticed differences in temperament, in-
ducing the belief that she had married different
men.”
Herr Musbruck, a judgment I claim.
I'm the victim of marital: sins;
My connivance I strongly disclaim,
But my husband appears to be twins;
It’s really unpleasant to find
In your nest, be it urban or rural,
Single-blessedness you have resigned
For a husband who’s palpably plural.
I thought when we put up the banns
We had done the right thing, as befits ;
But it seems, when I hitched up with Hans,
That I also got married to Fritz.
Have I now gpt two hubbies, or none?
Though my heart is remarkably supple,
I’d rather be faithful to one
Than semi-sincere to a couple.

On the 24th Vic. Treasurer McPherson
will complete 2000 days in office. He began
as Finance Minister under Bowser, and kept
on under Lawson. But even this fine score
is far below that of Gillies and Deakin for a
continuous innings. As members of the
Service-Berry and the follow-on Gillies-
Deakin coalition they put up a record of
2800 days.
George Judah Cohen, who passed his 81st
milestone the other day, still takes an active
interest in some of the multitudinous finan-
cial concerns with which he is associated.
He belongs to a millionaire family (Louis
Cohen of Liverpool, England, who died a
while back, was one brother), which is re-
ported to be the tenth wealthiest in
the world. The Sydney man has kept very
strictly to his religion, and is the recognised
leader of Jewry in these parts, although his

President of the Great Synagogue.

City-councillor
BERT EDWARDS ,
who represents
Kingston's old dis-
trict in the S. Aus.
State Assembly.
Groperland’s Agent-General-elect, H. P.
Colebatch, casually mentions that he accepted
the job “because he felt the need of knowing
more about his own country before returning
to public life in W.A.” It is a reminder
that the State’s most fluent and graceful
speaker is not native-born; also, an assur-
ance that lie regards a term in London as
merely a temporary break in his career as a
W.A. legislator. Nevertheless, not one of
Colebatch’s predecessors in the Agency-
General has taken up public life in W.A.
where he left it. Edward Wittenoom re-
turned to the Leg. Council —he is now
President—but never to office. Henry Lefrcy
is something of an exception, for he
flickered up into transient prominence as
the head of a Government during the war,
but, prior to that, be had to start at the
bottom and wait several years before he
could win back his old seat. The Agency-
General finished Walter James’s political,
career in his own country ; no constituency
w-anted him when he returned, for all his
gifts. Hector Rason and Newton Moore,
two more ex-Premiers, never tried, and pos-
sibly never intended, to come back to W.A.
W. M. Hughes has joined the Australian
Journalists’ Assoc, in one of the most criti-
cal years of its life—unless it can come to
terms with the employers for a new agree-
ment before December there will be an appeal
to the Arbitration Court as there was in
1917. The headquarters are now in Mel-
bourne, but they may shift to Sydney next
year, and Billy may be made general presi-
dent. Then we would see!
There would have been columns in the
papers about him if Australia had acquired
a new pr.ze fighter half the size that Paul
Raphael Montford is in his profess on. But
Montford is only a sculptor; and while he
is laboriously making h.mself known to
architects and others he has taken a job
as art master at the Gordon School of Tech-
nology, Geelong. Paul Montford, whose
father was curator of the Royal Academy
School of Sculpture, won the Royal
BENNO MOISEIWITSCH in a busy
moment.
Academy Gold Medal and Travelling
Scholarship when he was 25, and for some
years he continued his studies in Italy and
Paris. Returning, he proceeded to work
mainly on figures and groups with an archi-
tectural setting, and there is a great deal
of his work in Cardiff, Glasgow, and else-
where ; and two well-known groups on the
School of Engineering at South Kensington
are his.
“Emu”: Mention of Mick Considine, ex-
M.H.R., hustling on the Port Melbourne
wharves (B. 3/4/’23), recalls that a brother
in defeat, Sam Nicholls, late of the Mac-
quarie seat (N.S.W.), has a job in his old
electorate as a ganger in a quarry. Nicholls’s
downfall was due to sheer fatalism. A
Nationalist pointed the bone of defeat at him,
and Sam laid down to be beaten by 80-odd
votes. Carl Johnson, ex-State M.L.A. for
the same district, now hustles for a small
crust in the office of solicitor W. D.
McMahon. Tom Lavelle, who was outed by
Dr. Neville Howse for the Federal Calare
seat, was lately delivering lunch-hour
“spruiks” to workmen on behalf of a wide-
awake land-and-estate agency.
The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant turned
into his 84th lap on May 9.
“Spenner”: My nomination for thorough
church organisation goes to Bendigo. Until
recently Top was responsible for one flock,
Bottoms for another, while Sides was organ-
ist and leading light in a third conventicle.
Top, Sides, Bottoms—and still the worldly of
Bendigo achieved their ends.
The dwindling top-hat and frock-coat bri-
gade lost one of its most ornamental mem-
bers when Ernest Whitfeld, of Launceston
(Tas.), went west at 79. He was born at
Southport, where his father, F. F. Whitfeld,
was Government Medical-Officer. After some
years on the land in Maoriland apd the
Speck, he settled in Launceston and made a
hobby of 'collecting Government appoint-
ments. At various times he was Coroner,
Police Magistrate, Commissioner of the
Court of Requests, State and Federal
Returning-Officer, Census Enumerator, Chair-
man of the Public Works Commis-
sion and member of the Commission on
Education. There was hardly a public insti-
tution in Launceston with which Whitfeld
was not connected, and he was the town’s
unofficial historian. His collection of books,
papers, coins, stamps, abo. tools and other
historical items is one of the best in the
Speck.
J. D. McGruer, who passed out in Christ-
church recently, was Maoriland s rag king.
His name was over drapery shops in 20
different towns in the Shaky Isles, and his
face was as well known in Melbourne, Brad-
ford and Manchester as in Wellington. He
was a shrewd, hard-headed business man who
amassed much money, a fair parcel of which
now goes to institutions in Scotland.
The recent discussion about the export
■of Australian fauna recalls that W. L.
Crowther, a leading shipowner, doctor and
politician in the Speck in the ’seventies, was
in his youth a mighty hunter and trapper.
In 1839 he took to London on the ship Emu
a choice collection of Tasmanian animals
and birds. These he sold to the London
Zoo, and with the proceeds paid for his medi-
cal education at St. Thomas’s Hospital.
One of Melbourne’s most youthful hospital
superintendents is H. Boyd Graham, the
new head of the Children’s Hospital, Carl-
ton. He was one of the 100 Australians
selected for the British A.M.C. early in the
war, and quickly shot up to the rank of
major, returning eventuallv with the D.S.O.
and M.C. with bar. Terms as resident med.
at the Melbourne and the Children’s pro-
vided him with experience for his nresent job.
Graham was educated at Scotch College,
took his M.D. at Melbourne ’Varsity, and is
only 30 now.
11. E. Boote, of Sydney Worker, has
given the A.L.P. executive its latest knock.
The. uppish body called upon him to attend
and explain recent articles, but was promptly
told that its right to make the demand didn’t
exist, as he is not in any way undef the
authority of the A.L.P. Further, his engage-
ment with the Worker cannot be terminated
in a hurry, even if the trustees wanted to ter-
minate it—which they don’t. Boote, who
edited the Queensland Worker before he
got the Sydney job, is a mild-mannered little
man with an antipathy to alcohol and a
large capacity for making himself liked with-
out intending to.
There must be money in patent-agency
business. Edwin Phillips, of Toorak, who
faded out in February, left £33,000 in Vic.
There are also assets abroad. The bulk goes
to the widow and children, but there are
several bequests, including £lOOO to the
Salv’army Training Home and £5OO to the
Anglican Cathedral Chapter.
! It sounds like “safety first”-when Sydney
Telegraph takes J. R. Wallace on the
board, pice Robert Sands. Wallace is one of
the best-known riflemen in Australia. He
was with the N.S.W. Naval Contingent at
the Boxer rumpus in 1900; two years later
he ; represented N.S.W. in the Federal
match ; and for a couple of decades he has
been one of the stalwarts of the N.S.W.
Rifle Assoc.
“F. J.” : Twenty-two years on May 9 since
George, the present King, opened the first
Commonwealth Parliament in Melbourne.
Half of those first members are dead. Of
the;ss survivors not more than 10 are now
sitting in the Federal Houses, and some of
these, being Senators defeated at the last
elections, will retire shortly. Austin Chap-
man, Hughes and Watkins (Ma State) and
Bamford and McDonald (Q.) have sat con-
tinuously in the Reps. O’Keefe (Speck), in
the first Senate, now represents Denison in
the other House. Senator Pearce and Chap-
man link up the opening day with the pre-
sent Ministry.
“Lexite”: The recent valedictory tendered
F. John Sommerhoff by mostly-Labor friends
in Sydney recalls ancient history. Sommer-
hoff was probably the first ’Varsity man in
N. S. Wales to proclaim himself a Laborite;
and as he was a brilliant student his espou-
sal of the new movement created a stir. But
when he stood for Flinders, the old State
electorate which is part of Surry Hills, he
was badly beaten, tie has maintained a sen-
timental membership of the United Laborers’
Union for 17 years. He coached Davey Hall
when he was studying Law; and remem-
brance of that fact gave Sommerhoff a big
pull with the Government of which Hall was
a member.
“Drydog”: Sydney’s wobbly water-supply
has brought up the name of T. W. Keele,
formerly fighting president of the Water
Board. Keele often grappled with the officers
of the Public Works Dept., and had the best
of them every time they met—over the con-
struction of the Cataract dam, the cutting
of tunnels, and any other thing that could
be made a casus belli. Once he even took
on the State geologists, and laced them on
their own subject. He won so invariably
that, when one of the usual shindies between
the Board and the department under the
still-existing fool system of divided control
cropped up, a Sydney paper remarked as the
parties were entering the ring that it was
safe to conclude that Keele was right again,
without waiting to hear argument.
George Edward Rich, of the Federal High
Court, who had his GOth birthday on the
3rd, is a native of Braidwood (N.S.W.),
where his father, Canon Rich, was Anglican
minister. (Afterwards for many years he
was chaplain to Darlinghurst Gaol.) The
son was called to the Bar in 1882, was an
acting Judge in N.S.W. 1911-12, then put
in a year as Puisne Judge before accepting
the Bigh Court job, on the resignation of
Piddington, who, like Julian Salomons in
the N.S.W. Supreme Court, was appointed
but not sworn in.
The Joneses are coming to the front at
last in Vic. Pour of them —the chairman
of the Forest Commission, Inspector-General
of the Insane, the Labor party leader in the
Upper Chambah, and the woman acting-presi-
dent of the council
of education—are
in the limelight for
one thing or the
other. The most
notable modern
Jones the State has
h a d—E.B., t h e
Railway Commis-
sioner—d ie d too
soon. Vic. isn’t
particularly proud
of the only Jones
who has ever made
a noise in the Leg.
Assembly—h e of
the famous Mint
Sauce incident—
and it is up to
some one of the
clan to atone by
becoming Premier.
Bruce has shown
that a five years’
apprenticeship in
politics is sufficient
to get to the top.
A. A. BILLSON.
M.L.A., of Victoria.
“H.”: After 47 years in the Vic. Lands
Dept. E. F. Selk retires at the end of May.
Born just 60 years ago at the foot of Mt.
Buffalo, he made a start in the Oineo Survey
Office at 13. He was in charge of the
Mallee branch for nearly three decades, and
.much of the credit for successful settlement
there is his, though the spotlight never fell
on him. A benevolent Cabinet turned down
his application for six months’ furlough,
though he and the usual annual leave were
strangers.
“0.P.H.” : As I passed ex-Gov. Stanley in
Collins-street the other day, I recalled how
Private Sec. Hood saved him from spoiling his
“turn” at the opening of a State session. While
S’Arthur, in his uniform and cocked hat, was
reading the Speech he turned over two leaves
instead of ohe, and was plodding steadily on
when Hood reached out and had one page
turned back. A previous experience of the
sort had made. Victor PI. careful. Governor
Talbot had missed out a page, and A. A.
Billson wanted to know in the Assembly
which speech was to be discussed—the one
his Ex. read or the one he didn’t.
“G.A.C.”: Maorilanders in Australia
whoop with joy at the news that Professor
Dettman is to be the new headmaster of
Sydney Grammar. He has been Prof, of
Classics in Auckland for years, and it is
hard to imagine the old grey ’Varsity with-
out him. I Sat under him at Latin iectures
for three years, and have never known any-
one who put more life into old bones than
he. His translations were a delight to listen
to, absolutely devoid of any suggestion of
pedantry, and his beginning- and end-of-term
lectures were the joy and despair of the
weaker brethren.
T. C. Brennan, Vic. barrister, who was
admitted to the Ma State Bar the other
day, is one of a .brainy Bendigo family which
has made its presence felt in Melbourne.
Brother Frank, who, with Bundle, chases
Costs in Collins-street, is Federal Labor
member for Batman ; Willie is chief leader-
writer on the Argus and the joy of the
Yorick Club; Harry is in charge of the
courts staff on the same Conservative organ;
sister Anna, LL.B., is in the firm with
Frank. While studying law T. C. Brennan
was a sub. on the Argus. He is a front-
rank debater, but hasn’t yet persuaded a con-
stituency to make him a legislator, though
he has had several tries. After Colin
Boss, whom he defended, was hanged, he
(with the consent of the Bar Committee)
published “The Gun Alley Tragedy,” a re-
view of the case, mainly with the purpose
of showing how dangerous is the modern ten-
dency to pre-judge an accused person against
whom public feeling has been inflamed. Bren-
nan, who ought to have got at the truth if
anyone ever did, was satisfied that Ross
wasn’t a murderer.
“Tiger” Inglis, who made a tidy fortune
out of “Billy tea,” is recalled by the death
of his brother, Sir Robert Inglis, chairman
of the London Stock Exchange, who left an
estate valued at £328,471. “Tiger” lived in
India for a time, and enshrined his adven-
tures in a book. He was M.L.A. for New
England (N.S.W.), 1885-94, and Minister
of Public Instruction in the Parkes Govern-
ment, 1887-89.
THE DREAM OF IMMORTALITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
While Hickson boomed for many days
I cherished hopes ecstatic
That with a course of prayer and praise
He’d rid one poor asthmatic
Of all his ills, and charge his breast
With some divine afflatus
To shoo catarrh from off his chest,
And kill the cough which erst distrest
His breathing apparatus.
But no asthmatic found relief,
As far as I’ve detected,
So I maintain my unbelief
In any cures effected.
Dear brothers, I am loath to prick
The bubble faith that’s in you:
I merely ask, if means so quick
As Hickson’s mission healed the sick,
Oh, why does Death continue?
No need to ask where is its sting;
No more could it affright you
If, with the aid that prayer can bring,
You drew the fangs that bite you ;
No need to be a ghost, or wraith,
No hats with mourning bands on,
If as the Lord Archbishop saith,
We all could cure our ills with Faith
Whom Hickson laid his hands on.
I’d form a company to-day
(A catchy name I’d fix on)
For teaching members how to pray
In unison with Hickson.
Their heaven would be here on earth:
They’d never pass Death’s portals;
They’d live without a second birth,
An endless life of joy and mirth —
I’d call them The Immortals.
VICTORIA.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
“Jay Aye”: In the backblocks of Kan-
garoo Island (S.A.) there is one good stretch of road
which was constructed by a .woman contractor, who
not. only supervised the work but did her full share
with the pick and shovel. She is a native of the
island aud has never crossed to the mainland. Her
home is in the scrub, and when not contracting she
snares wallabies, at which she is an expert. When
setting out on a snaring expedition, her costume
consists of a wheat-bag with holes made for her
head and arras to pass through, leggings made from
wallaby skins, and a strong pair of boots. Although
her more civilised neighbors don’t approve of her
mode of living, yet she is respected by them, and
their doors are open to her. She, however, is shy
and reserved, prefers to go her own way, and has
always turned a deaf ear to admirers seeking her
company.
“Nugget”: The brown snake is a good
scratch puller. While we were haypressing on the
Hunter River (N.S.W.) some time ago one big
brown specimen was pinned to the ground with a
pitchfork, and while Bill and Andy wa’ndered about
in search of a stick, the captive poked his head
into a mouse-hole and pulled himself; free. He tore
himself in an almost "straight line from the middle
of the body ; to the tail. -Even then it' was only
a temporary, escape.; we dug the mutilated gentleman
out with a. hay-knife and finished him with the
whip-handle.
#. V •••*■;.: • * * #
“Tauwarra”: My Brown Brother’s idea
of Heaven; “S’pose I good fella man; I no steal'm
spmet’in’.; I no humbug ’long Gavamani; all time
I. hear’m good fella talk ’long missionari; all right,
I die. I no finish altogether—no fear! I go sail
about on top ’long sky, all same pigeon.”
“L36”: “Tom Pepper” (B. 12/4/’23)
hasn’t got half-way to the record for kangaroo
shooting at one sitting. I saw a full-blooded abo.
with a .32 cal. rifle account for 37 inside two hours.
There was a hrle in a wire-netting fence dividing
a plain from a scrub paddock ; the ’roos came through
to get on the feed .at night, and the nigger stood on
a black stump near the hole and shot them as
they came along.
,* » » *
“Centre”: “Skyrider’s” springs, that
break out in a gully on the sides of which big
timber has been ringbarked (B. 12/4/’23), are of
a breed different from those that took the count on
a selection I ruined some years back in Bananaland.
The creek carried “permanent water” according to
both local tradition and the charts at the Lands
Office. I wanted some more. trickle; and, after
listening to a lot of
boobs who declared
that the only way to
set more water was
to ringbark and clear
every stick of timber
off the place, I made a.
clean sweep. Before
I’d got the logs and
rubbish off the ground
the creek . stopped run-
ning. In a couple of
months the waterholes
were dry; and a month
later I was forced to
leave the whole thing,
including the :£175
worth of improve-
ments (?) for the
next dam’ fool to
tackle. Ringbarking
most emphatically does
not set springs of
water breaking out
anywhere. If there
were less wholesale
destruction of stand-
ing timber in Austra-
lia there’d be less
howling about, water
shortage. My selec-
tion was only 214
acres, but I was sur-
rounded by others
who were all doing
the same fool stunt, converting that portion of the
map into a barren, treeless, waterless patch of ugli-
ness—all through mis-spent. energy and ignorance.
“Jimmy Possum”: “Koala Lover” (B.
8/3/’23) remarks on the earth-eating habit of the
native-bear. Earth appears to' be -the koala’s medicine.
Before I discovered the secret I found it diffi-
cult to rear a young rubber-nose, the little crea-
tures dying, as a rule, after a few weeks from what
seemed to be digestive trouble. Now when I want
to rear a baby bear I take particular care to pro-
vide it with a clod of fresh earth every day,
so that it may have a nibble at it when feeling
out of sorts. I never have any trouble in rearing
young grunters now; but I find it hard to keep
them at home when they attain any size, the call
of the wild being over-strong in these animals.
You may handle them every day and give them the
best of tucker, but they’ll make tracks for the bush
at the first opportunity. Delightful, lovable crea-
tures, they should be protected for all time.
* * * *
“Mamaku”: Cattle dying of starvation
while up to their knees in green grass and clover
are common in an area of over a million acres in the
North Island (M.L.). At first the trouble was
thought to be a disease and was called “bush sick-,
ness,” but investigation has shown it to be mal-
nutrition owing to the absence of some essential
element in the herbage. Government vets, and
chemists, as well as private individuals, have tried
for over 20 years to discover what that missing
element is, but so far without success. Animals
brought in from unaffected country thrive for a
few months, and then start to go off in condition.
THE SOFT ANSWER.
“ L ook ’ee, Cap'n, if I can’t ’ave more money I’m goin’ chuck
up me joh. I've been a fool lona ’nough on this mine.”
“So ’ee ’ave, boay, so ’ee ’ave.”
If quickly taken to outside country they recover;
if iit>ty:>they die. A drench of citrate of iron and
ammonia has kept some animals in condition, but
no one has yet devised treatment; of any use in
practice. Liming, top-dressing, and all kinds of
licks, have been tried in vain, and soil-analysis dis-
; closes : nothing. ; Lending concerns are fighting shy
of this land as : a , mortgage security, and there is
a fortune awaiting the man who can hit upon the
.missing element and then buy up enough of the
land, which is at present about as valuable as
Herman marks. A curious fact is that horses are
not affected.
* * * *
J.S.J?. : An entry for one of the queer
, events. The other day a row among my fowls at
Pyrnble (N.S.W.) caused me to investigate, and
I found that a fox had made a jump at one of
the chooks, missed his mark apd come down in
such a way that his body was firmly wedged between
two saplings. A Winchester finished him.
* * *
‘Cobba-Cobba” : Once when dining at a
Port Moresby (Papua) pub I noticed a sausage
1 fall off one of the plates which a native “boy”
was carrying in. Pausing. long enough to retrieve
the sausage with his bare toe and deftly return
it to the plate, -the nig unconcernedly placed the
tempting morsel before the diner on my right.
I was hardly prepared for the result of mv
whispered warning. With a guttqral roar, my neigh-
bor (Alf the Trader) seized the surprised nigger,
and after ramming both sausages down the boy’s
throat nearly choking him in the operation—and
breaking the plate on his woolly head, big Alf shot
the waiter head-first through the dining-room door.
TheP, calmly reseating himself, be roared for “some
breakfast.”
* * « •
“Pantagruel”: One ,T. F. Jones, a W.
Queenslander from Julia Creek, claims to give sheep
an almost total immunity from blovflv. ' His pre
paration consists of 71b. arsenic (about 87 per
cent, pure) and 21b. soda ash, mixed with i or 5 lb.
lanoline. A kerosene-tin of water is added, and the
solution boiled, until only half a tinful is left.
This is sufficient for 100 gallons of spray. Soft-soap
(in casks) may be used instead of the lanoline, the
object of either being to form .a protective film,
which lasts for months. The spray should have a
pressure of about 1801 b., and be held about a foot
away from the crutch. Two thousand sheep can
be treated in a day.
* * * *
Tonimac ’: A while back an abo. wan-
dered into the general emporium in Cairns (Q.)
where I was employed and asked for “some leggin’.”:
I showed him all the different kinds of leg-gear
that the place stocked, but he burst out, “No. hot
them fella. You know, Mister, leggin’ for missus—
belly leggin’.” Whoever they were for, he wanted
corsets.
“N’lmporte”: My entry for “Snail’s”
fastest animal stakes (B. 19/4/’23) is the whippet.
One I met in K&lgoorlie gave the world’s champion
—Postle—about 50yds. in a hundred, and was beaten
by only a yard or so. ■ Her defeat was due mainly
to her not being at her best against a human. In
anything above 150yds. the horse Wins easily.
“Winkle”: When “A. Jocelyn” wrote (B.
8/3/’23) of the maddening effect of St. John’s wore
on stock he was riding his pen on a snaffle and it
got away with him ; and “T.H.” (B. 19/4/’23), who
rebuked him, went to the other extreme by saying
that stock would die of starvation in acres of wort.
The truth lies between these two. The effect of
this weed on cattle is
very often hurtful if
they make it the chief
item of their diet;
yet the only places on
Crown lands around
Bright (Vic.) where
the curse is under
control are those where
there is enough grass
under it to attract
stock. The latter, in
their effort, to get it
the grass, bite off the
shoots of the wort, and
so weaken and ulti-
mately kill the plant.
Bearing this in mind,
the Vic. Dept, of Agri-
culture conducted
experiments in wort-
infested lands by plant-
ing many large plots
each with a different
strong-growing grass;
and now the claim
that Kentucky blue,
hard fescue or cocks-
foot will, if planted
around infested areas,
act as a buffer r.r.d
keep the weed from
spreading; and that if
paspalhm once gets j
footing it will in
time choke out the
wort. But all these
good results will hap-
pen only if the rabbits
are kept in check, for
they will eat and so
weaken tan grasses as
to make them unfit, for
the battle. Though it
is difficult, land fit for
agriculture can be
cleared of wort by
continual cultivation,
and if tobacco or potatoes are grown, th. eradication
of the weed«is only part of the daily round. On
the thousands of acres of poor Crown lands, however,
the problem must be left to puzzle posterity.
* * * *
“Primer”: “Blunder Buss’s” advice (B.
15/3/’23) re testing a rifle for accuracy by fixing it
in a vice is contrary to the ideas of most rifle
makers, who say the best results are obtained by
sitting down with a rest for the elbows and muzzle
of the rifle, and- aiming for each shot. The barrel
expands with the heat of firing, and the grip of a
vice causes unequal expansion. As to the killing
power of the .22 cartridge; with the exception of
buffalo and alligator 1 have found the .22-long heavy
enough for any Australian game up to 100yds. Most,
of my kangaroo shooting- has been done with th°
32.10, but some of my best skins were got with a
.22 Winchester. “8.8.’’ may be surprised to learn
that a number of country butchers use a similar
rifle to* slaughter cattle. I always had the impression
that the .22 rifle held the records for accuracy at
distances up to 100yds., and mv experience is that
there isn’t anything in 'the same class for the
casual shooter. Give a man who can’t shoot straight
a 15.90 and he will leave as much wounded and
dying game in the bush as he would with the
lighter rifle. A good plan when 1 wring a .22 rifle
is to get one that, is made to take one size of
cartridge only. The long and short cartridges have
different weight bullets, and require different rifling
in the barrel to get the best results.
AN AMPHIBIOUS ANSWER.
THE MAGISTRATE: “Now, tell me. Did you
or did you not strike the map?”
THE ACCUSED: "The answer is in the infir-
mary, your Worship.”
“Birre Gurra : Tell “Ragar”(B. 5/4/’23),

on the rear end of a carpet-snake, that his excite-
ment was quite Unfounded. A carpet-snalce will
never turn when anyone becomes attached to his
appendage. I’ve tried it scores of times. lie

They wander up and down,
And now and then they quit the Bush
And saunter into town;
But there their miles grow ill at ease,
Their trodden leagues unhappy,
1' or nigh them dream no gracious trees,
.No saplings green and sappy.
The big roads and the little roads
Are travelled day and night;
The big roads and the little roads,
The roads of red and white.
They twist and turn and wind about,
Not minding hill nor hollow,
And every one of them cries out:
“O follow, fellow, follow!”
If I had legs and feet to match
I’d take them at their word;
I d up and out and down their leagues
Light-hearted as a bird.
I’d whistle, jig and sing my song,
The blue sky arching over,
Nor find the longest road too long,
A rambler and a rover!
1 hough little good I’d do the world
I’d do it less of harm,
As 1 went singing down the roads,
My coat upon my arm ;
And care should leave my heart immune,
And trouble melt like vapor;
And when the breezes piped their tune
Tis I should, dance and caper.
I d beam and smile on man and maid,
With greeting frank and free,
And treat the man and kiss the maid—
If so they did agree
And ale were nigh, and eyes were bright;
For much of joy he misses
"ho fares not when he should and might
On cakes and ale and kisses.
A WHOLE HOG LER.
WOWSES FARMER : “You oughter feel ashamed o' yerself yettin'
’ alf-shikkered every pay-day."
INTEMPERATE EMPLOYEE : “ Well, it's the best-I kin do on the lousy
screw you pays me!"
I'd get to know the speech of trees —
Their language not of words —
And I should gossip night and noon
With owls and little birds,
And learn in time, though tired and wan,
And teased with dust and gravel,
That every road I trod upon
Was still the best to travel.
For every road and any road,
As sages are agreed,
If we but have the eyes to see,
Is just the road we need.
’Tis we alone with feet that drag,
And spirits damp and dreary,
And troubles rolled up in our swag,
That make the going weary.

“Bill Bowyang” : The tomato-coekies in the
N.Q. district where I earn my beer and bread were
beginning to feel the effects of drought. Jim Regan,
who owns 20 acres of good tomato-growing land,
had started to rejoice in a slight precipitation of
rain, when Joe Cluney, who was doing-some plough-
ing for him, happened to enter the kitchen. “Better
stay in outer the rain,” said Regan. “Oh, that’s
all right,” replied Cluney. “I don’t mind working
in a bit of a shower like that.” “But that’s not
what 1 mean,” replied Regan. “Next time it rains
you come into the house —I want that water on the
land, not on your flamin’ clothes.”

Bench Test Hudson Super Six,
The best equipped Factory in America to-day is
the Hudson-Essex Plant of Detroit.
Extract from the English “Motor" February 27, 1923.
Perhaps the outstanding feature of the Hudson and
Essex Factory is the rapidity with which production
methods have been improved, and I am told it is no
exaggeration to say that since the war the concern have
doubled their output, and now only employ half the
number of men they used to require. In the assembly
of the engine it is particularly noticeable that, despite
being produced in such quantities, it cannot be said that
the quality of the article has in any way been lowered.
After assembly the engines are given a five-hour bench
test, running from 300 r.p.m. to 2000 r.p.m. and, in
order to demonstrate balance, a five-cent piece was
placed on its edge on a Hudson engine which was running
at 1700 r.p.m. The general assembly is almost the same,
the two chassis coming up through the floor on parallel
platforms, the axles, springs, wheels, etc., being
assembled whilst on the move. They are then spray-
painted, dried in the oven (still on the move), and finally
ascend up through the ceiling, the bodies having been
placed in position. They had, at the time of my visit, a
total production of about 240 cars a day, a ratio of
35/45 Essex to Hudson.
This is one reason why Essex and Hudson
represent the best value to-day.

“Tai’ago”: “F.Q.’s” twelfth of an acre
which returned him onions equal to 28 tons to the
acre (B. 19/4/’23) is well above the average; but
in any large area producing up to 16 or 18 tons
to the acre it would be possible to pick out a
twelfth of an acre yielding at the rate of 28 tons
per acre. I don’t know the absolute record for an
onion crop, but I have seen 30 tons to the acre in a
10-acre paddock in the Ivooweerup Swamp (Vic.). In
a crop like that the heaviest parts would yield up to
40 tons per acre in small areas. Incidentally, .T.
Curtain, of that district, cleared over £2OOO from
the harvest of five acres some years ago.
* * * *
“Baal Gammon”: Ginger and I once
‘Worked for a hayseed out on the Lachlan. After
he finished his own stripping, he had to go 10
miles to help another cocky. We put Nugget in
the dray, and heaved the winnower aboard. Ginger
sat on the near side shaft, driving, and had a good
half-hour’s start. When Cocky and I got moving
we found one of the dray tyres along the road; a
bit further on we found a felloe, and after a while
two more. When we overtook Ginger, still going
strong, singing at the top of his voice, “I’ll be with
you when the Lachlan flows with beer,” Old
Hayseed roared him up in language fully two miles
south of the Meridian for travelling with only
three felloes and a few spokes in the wheel.
“Blime,” said Ginger in amazement, “I was be-
ginning to think there must be a lot of ruts on
this road. I couldn’t see the blanky wheel from
where I was sitting.”
“Bogan Bill”: Some years ago I was
watching an old prospector cradling some mullock
down at the creek near our place, when a new-chum
jackeroo from the next station rode up. He looked
on in silence for a few minutes, and then unbur-
dened himself: “Ai saay, old chap, it’s taking you
an awfully long time to wash that bally old box
out, isn’t it? You were at it when I went past
here last week.”
“FY7”: There are at least half-a-dozen
varieties of the prickly-pear curse in Southern Queens-
land. One of them is a trailing, climbing variety
that specially affects the thick timber spoken of
by “F. Clinton” (B. 12/4/’23), strangling the
trees and filling the branches with a mat of
tangled spikiness. Imagine the lawyer-vine of N.
Queensland and Papua crossed with the pear, and
you have the horror exactly.
“Jimmy Possum”: I don’t know whether
red ash possesses the saponaceous virtues claimed by
‘■Tomb” (B. 15/3/’23), but I do know T that the
leaves make excellent fodder for stock,- both horses
and cattle being extremely partial' to the soft, fleshy
foliage. In the great parch of 1902, wherever these
trees occurred old Dobbin and Tinker could be seen
straining their necks to get at the succulent leaves.
Even when feed is plentiful some animals cannot
pass the trees without having a pick at them. An-
other useful fodder-tree is the broad-leaf wattle, a
fact very few seem to know.
“Russ” : I was having dinner at the Blank-
• ville Arms recently when my attention was drawn
to a little bone toothpick hanging on a hook by
a piece of thread. Underneath was written in hold
roundhand; “Will the customers kindly replace the
toothpick after using.”
* * * #
“The Rumpus”.: Re mocking magpies.
In the early days of Vic. a little mining township
was expanding westward over abandoned diggings,
and the shafts and cuttings were being filled in by
a number of drays. Each tipover was listened to
by an observant magpie who lived on a gumtree
near by, and he learned the driver’s “Back, back,
back,” to a nicety. One day a driver, after tipping,
left his dray and went to fill his water-bag. When
he'Teturned he found Mag had backed his horse and
dray over the edge, the vehicle being smashed and
the horse killed in the process.
* * * #
“Jackaburra”; What about a bloke nearly
chopping his own head off ?
Bob and I were splitting-
posts in green timber.
We had just sawn off one
log, and. I was starting
with the cross-cut on the
next length while Bob
was barking the one just
cut off. He started to
sha re the top, but got the
axe a little too much from
the perpendicular, and the
cheek struck the sappy
wood. The brim of my
old felt was cut through in
the course of the rebound,
and before Bob knew
exactly what was happen-
ing the face of the axe
came round and struck
him where the chicken usu-
ally gets it. The cut
was about an eighth of an
inch deep. I had a devil
of a job to stop the bleed-
ing, and spoiled my only
two shirts before I thought
of emptying the flour-bag
and using that.
“Archbell”: “Jesmond” (B. 19/4/’23)
wants to know how to put the wind up the blow-
flies that are paying embarrassing attention to his
blankets. I toiled in a general store in Gippsland
(Vic.) a few years ago, and the blowflies there were
up to the same game; but they only took on the
colored blankets, never touching the white. To stop
their capers my boss used to put a liberal supply of
black pepper on the blankets, and always advised
purchasers not to sleep with their heads under them
until they washed the pepper out.
* *• * *
“FY7”: “Caesar’s” reference to “The
Eulo Queen” (B. 19/4/’23) reminds me that the
late respected monarch of the Paroo once attempted
to extend her empire. In the ’nineties she suddenly
appeared in Brisbane as licensee of a Queen-street
pub. In 24 hours every Westerner who knew the
lady by repute (or otherwise) had called, and in
a few days the gilded youth and silvered eld of the
city followed suit. The squat little woman, with her
chin just about on a level with the bar, and
loaded with huge diamond and emerald rings, drew a
good house for a while. At the end of the year
the licensing authorities decided that the hotel main-
tained an unnecessarily large staff of house- and parlor-
maids, and the Queen was to sell out. She
dropped a lot of money over the deal.
* * * *
“Yarra Bank”: In support .of “Jim
Dandy” (B. 19/4/’23), in his reply to “Azrim” (B.
15/2/’23), let me quote an article by W. S. Berridge,
F.Z.S., in “Wonders of Land and Sea,” vol. IV.,
page 897
The Ringhals cobra is endowed with the peculiar
gift of being able to spit out poison from its fangs
for a distance of quite 6ft. The reptile invariably
aims at the eyes of an adversary, and should the
direction he true, its poison will cause a temporary
blindness, fortunately hot attended with any perma-
nent ill-effects. Needless to say, its bite is fatal.
At the London Zoo. Gardens the keepers take special
precautions against the behavior of this snake, and
Invariably wear motor goggles to protect their eyes
whilst attending them.
A note from Ross Lindsay:—
“Verde Gris’s” reference to Arnhem’s Land (B.
29/3/’23) recalls the adventurous exploring expedi-
tion into that country under the leadership of my
father, the late David Lindsay, on behalf of the S.
Aus. Government, in 1883. The party consisted of
four white men and two black boys, the late Walter
Guthbertson being second ! in command. A good deal’
of trouble was experienced with the natives, which
culminated one night when a numerous party <>f
hostile blacks was detected in hiding elose to the
camp. All night a double watch was kept, and
rockets were let off to scare the myalls away. They
speared one horse, but no direct attack was made.
The report and maps of a great part of Arnhem's
Land explored by Lindsay are in the possession of
the South Aus. Government.
* * * *
“Yindarlgooda”: “50’s” idea (B. 5/4/’23)
that ants will avoid loose stable manure wants solo-
ing and heeling. The other day in a stable here
(Tvalgoorlie) 1 noticed that a whole colony of
small black ants had entrenched themselves in the
three or four inches of loose, dry manure which
covered the ground floor of the stable. They were
well dug in and quite at home, so 1 concluded that
they liked it.
A damp subject:—
“G.8.R.”: “Skyrider” (B. 12/4/’23) asks if
there’s anything in the yarn about springs breaking
out in dry times. There is—a lot. On the lvilkivan
Nanango-road, near Kimbombi station, in South
Burnett (Q.), can be seen a splendid spring that
broke out during the height of the 1902 drought.
A clear stream burst forth from the slope of a
fairly high hill and lias been going strong ever
since. At Kingaroy, in the same district, a sub-
artesian bore that had given a good supply for a
long time suddenly gave out and remained dry for
years; but during the drought 12 years ago the
water made again, a better supply than previously,
and rose almost to the surface. One theory is that
the long drought and heat causes a cracking of the
hard earth crust that lies between, the surface and
the flowing stream, and the water is allowed to come
to the surface and burst forth as a spring.
“M. 8.”: Though springs' do break out in drought
time, “Skyrider” (B. 12/4/’23) misses by a mile
when he attributes the phenomenon to the ring-
barking of trees. During; protracted dry spells I
have known springs to appear where the timber
has been ringbarked for years, and also where the
DANGEROUS.
“I don’t like him, my child — he’s fast, terribly fast. Why, he
broke every record in the Maiden Plate.”
woodman’s axe has never been at work. It has
been known to occur on treeless plains. One Monaro
landowner tells me that quite lately at least a
dozen springs have appeared on his property where
previously there were no indications of subterranean
water. Another curious thing is that whereas there
is an increased flow from some springs during the
driest times, others near by fail completely. Many
bush people regard the breaking out of springs as
an indication of rain; but others look on it as a
continued dryness sign.
“Old Timer”: I’ve often seen springs start running
after prolonged drought, and have traced it to the
crayfish. They dig to the moist soil and release
the spring. The appearance of the water has no
bearing on subsequent weather.
“Wait-and-Watch”: In some parts of Vic. at
least, it is looked upon as a good sign when a
spring breaks out. There are several around here
/Avoca, Vic.), dry at present, that always run a few
days before rain.
THE SUPER-IRRITATION OF JONES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The driving force of his anger lifted him to
Olympian heights.” —American novel.
Just where the longest lane had turned
The earlj- bird was seen,
While dew to sudden emerald burned
In cups of gi assj- green;
And Jones was there in morning mood
To find a horse that strayed.
He was not feeling any good
That morn of pearl and jade.
The horse he felt was low and base—
A quadruped of shame —
The white star on its evil face
He called a shocking name;
And as he searched the landscape round
With hot, perspiring brow,
He swore he’d “fix the dog” when found,
And also “teach the cow.”
Hotter and hotter boiled his spleen
And raised a steam of power
That sent him raging through the green
From shining hour to hour.
Perhaps his previous training made
His muscles work that way
As round the hill and down the glade
He sought the star-faced bay.
Each hush and tree for miles and miles
llad lie examined well.
Where such a horse of evil wiles
Might shelter, who could tell ?
And still his wrath and speed increased,
A flame was in his eye;
He rode and rode and never ceased
Until he seemed to fly.
Tremendously he swept the hush ;
Nine townships saw him go.
A sudden light and then a whoosh;
And Jones was seen to flow,
One river of enwhiskered rage
With eyes of eddying light
That scintillantly seemed to gauge
All horses in their flight.
All horses at his coming ran
With stiffened mane and tail ;
And as the mad stampede began
Away went wire and rail.
Great stallions neighed a fearful blast
Of terror on the air;
Like threads the traces all were cast
From gelding and from mare.
And now- the great Lick telescope
Had caught a sight of Jones,
Like some huge comet on the slope
Begirt w-ith roaring zones
Of flaming sound that made a track
Of zig-zag blasphemy,
Proclaiming every horse as black
As shirts in Italy.
WHAT HE CALLED HOME.
FATHER O'FLYNN: “And where do yon
think you’re going to, Henncssy?”
HENNESSY ( resting by the way) : “Goin'
to? (hie). Why, to home, uv coorse.”
FATHER O'FLYNN: “To Hell, yon mean!”
HENNESSY: “Thank yes, yer rivirince. It’s
glad Oi am to hear yes say that (hie).
Oi’ll tell Bridget yes agree wid me.”
But little did the horses reck
Of science as they fled.
Their harness in a whirling wrecu,
With wild and thunderous tread
They felt that all the human force
Of “whoa,” “gee-back” and bash
Was gathered up without remorse
In one great stockwhip lash.
That lash was Jones; and on he came
Behind the mad stampede.
The kindest horse forgot his name,
The noblest shamed his breed.
With raging snort and flying foam,
And tails that tossed with fear,
They ran as brave men make for home
When chased by furious beer.
Up the last mountain of the world,
To reach its awful brow,
Their heads by their hindquarters hurled
Remembered “Do it now.”
The simple precept, learned in youth,
Ere horses’ limbs grew stiff,
Remained in all its dreadful truth —
And so they jumped the cliff.
But Jones remembered he was taught
To “look before you leap.”
In both his hands his soul he caught
Right on the topmost steep.
He felt that Fate had done its worst,
His limbs began to tire ;
And then he very gently burst
Through stress of inward fire.
A QUESTION OF ETIQUETTE.
GOVRNESS (reading) : “‘The horse and the cow is in the field.’ Now, what is wrong
with that sentence, Mary?”
MARY: “ The lady should be mentioned first.”
Ah, well! Perhaps ’twas better so.
Such anger could not last.
They built a little mound to show
He really Went too fast;
And when the stars are bright above
That mountain’s awful brow,
Full-charged with milk that children love,
Stands one astonished cow.
- Moral.
The moral of this tale is just
That horses should not stray;
Or, if they do, then let us trust
They won’t go far away.

The S.P.C.A. got in early this season, and
thus secured all the doggy people for its
Animals’ Ball at Paddington Town Hall last
week. This year the society celebrates a
jubilee, so there was an extra dash about the
decorations, carried out in gorgeous yellows
and yellow-browns, with strong supports of
flags and palms. The frocking was parti-
cularly eye-catching. Dame Margaret, who
was attended by her lord and Mr. Blandy,
flew jade-green silk and silver lace, with an
ermine stole that looked the genuine article.
Another frock of charm was worn by Mrs.
O. F. Alexander; it was built of black taffeta
embroidered in tiny pink rosebuds, and might
have slipped out of a Dickens page. The
fuchsia blush of the Bridges lady’s garnish-
ings was beaded in extremis, and flew a wing-
like effect; and Mrs. Geoffrey Fairfax’s good
profile surmounted a handsome black outfit.
A heavy battalion of Queenslanders were pre-
sent, including Mrs. Willie Collins, in some
wonderful diamonds and Dutch blue frock-
ing ; Dorothea Collins, in old-rose velvet; the
graceful Penelope Cay in velvet of turquoise
tones.
There was a swagger gathering in Farmer’s
Exhibition Hall when the State Ex. opened
the sale of gift pictures, the returns of which
will go towards the expense of the show of
Australian art in 'London. The Society of
Artists wns strongly represented in flesh and
canvas, and Ernest Watt lent his suave
presence to the morning function. There
are 95 examples of Australian work about
the walls; these include some charming wood-
cuts, among which Napier Waller’s work
stands out. (Napier got his right hand shat-
tered when soldiering, and when he came back
repatriated himself by teaching his left hand
the work that had formerly fallen to the
right.) There’s a Hans Heysen gum to be
had for 50 guineas, and a few inches of charm
by Adrian Feint named “Basket Willows.”
John D. Moore has sent a fascinating curve
of Middle Harbor; there are two Norman
Lindsays, but no Lambert or Longstaff.
The Rupert Bunny Exhibition has been
the week’s magnet at the Hordern Gallery;
and, although the artist shows masterly tech-
nique in getting light effects with his oils,
some of his grouping isn’t altogether satis-
factory. But Rupert, Rupert! It’s a case
of the girl on the horizon all the time —
the girl and her pretties.
The Feminist Club has chosen Miss Pres-
ton-Stanley as its nominee for the League of
Nations ; and Prime Minister Bruce is asked to
note “that the outstanding qualifications of
any representative selected on behalf of the
Women of Australia should be efficiency and
general knowdedge of international affairs
and personality.” Since her teens, Miss
Preston-Stanley has been an organiser of
the Liberal party, and quickly took a front
place as a platform speaker. _ At the last
State election she was one of the selected
candidates for Eastern Suburbs, coming sixth
amongst 23 candidates, defeating other
selected National candidates, several Progres-
sives and R. D. Meagher.
The annual show of the Society of Women
Painters was opened on Monday afternoon
by Dame Margaret, who wore a jade-green
liat and a biscuit-toned frock, made with
the new wing sleeve effect, very long as to
skirt, and with fur outlinings. President
Ethel Stephens, in a staring stripe, .piloted
the Dame around the walls; and after the
usual exchange of compliments, the ordinary
woman wandered about picking likely can-
vases for herself or her marrying friends, or
just made a field-day of talk of it. Muriel
Cornish shows some good work, and so does
Nora Gurdon. Ethel Stephens’s glowing
zinnias and Frankie P'ayne’s panel won
approval. Theo Cowan’s bit of sculping,
“The Surfer,” is an exquisite bit of work,
and should be left in undisputed possession
of its niche —she doesn’t look the kind of
girl who should be expected to share a room.
The show continues for another week.
Moiseiwitsch had no sooner pushed his
piano into Sydney than the Musical Associa-
tion started 'cutting sandwiches for his wel-
come-back party. This drew an overflow to
Farmer’s last Friday ; and the owner of the
magic hands, who has still the same quiet
and mournful manner, after showing appre-
ciation of the Frank Bridge quartet, played
by Frank Hutchens, Alfred Hill, Cyril Monk
and Gladstone Bell, and a quartet of Hill’s
own composition, made a speech, thanking
everybody, and glowed with enthusiasm over
Sydney’s determination to send Roy Agnew
to Europe. “His works compare favor-
ably with those of the modern group who
are now holding musical London,” is Moisei-
witsch’s opinion.
The C. H. Hoskinses, of the Lithgow
Steel Works, have been taking a day oft' to
marry their youngest chick, Kathleen, to
Edward Mackey. The wedding was done
in glittering style at St. Stephen’s, which
hid its Scotchbyterian sternness under a
mass of foliage and flowers, and had its
views further modified by the discarding
of bridal white in favor of gold and silver
brocade moored to its classic folds by an
outsize pearl buckler. The train blushed
like a rosy shell through a mist of ninon
on which silver lilies bloomed luxuriantly.
A Mechlin lace veil was an accessory; and
there was a group of pretty bridesmaids
whose names suggested the Greater Cate-
chism, and whose frocking suggested the
Slade school—it was burnt-orange gorgeous-
ness that carried glowing trails of nastur-
tiums. Two small nieces of the bride, Patsy
Wiesner and Nellie Crago, were train-
bearers, in the tiuftiness of silver tissue
veiled in vellum lace, their crowning glory
being pearl Marie Antoinette caps. The
’groom was attended by best-man Atwill
in Twentieth Century costume. The after-
the-ceremony party was a monster gathering,
entailing the services of a fleet of limousines
and one horse cab to carry the guests to
brilliantly illuminated Ashton, the Elizabeth
Bay home of the bride’s parents. Ashton
has but lately become the property of the
Hoskinses, who, on entry, rechristened it.
Previously it had been Brema, and before
that Bremen. But that was when it was
the home of Oscar Plate, manager of the
Nord-Deutscher Lloyd.
Macquarie-street eye-specialist d’Ombrain’s
eldest son, Dr. Arthur d’Ombrain, and pretty
Edna Ferguson-Murdoch (her mother is Mrs.
M. B. Moore, of St. Andrew’s, Rushcutters
Bay), have agreed to a partnership, to be
entered into on a date yet to be decided.
There was a silken purr among the pews
of St. Philip’s midway through last week,
when good-looking Beatrice Morrisby, of
Lindfield, married her equally good-looking
Lieutenant Davis, of H.M.A.S. Adelaide.
The church was thronged by the Navy and
its best girl, and the Commodore Addisons
and the Naval Commandant Craufurd couple
were front-seaters. Beatrice murmured the
customary promises from a mist of white
tulle that frothed above a frock of silver
brocade veiled in silver lace. Melbourne’s
Gertrude Dix dressed for the bridesmaid act
in a frock of primrose panne velvet, a black
velvet picture-hat and a gold basket spilling
over with blue delphiniums. She _was sup-
ported by two little nieces of the bride, Diane
and Lucille Dupain, from Rabaul, who
bloomed like baby posies from the midst of
their blue georgette and soft lace ruchings.
Lieut. Branson, R.N., stood by the ’groom
in the first section of the engagement, and
acted as escort to the bridesmaid when the
seal was set on his friend. The Australia
housed the party.
Richard Hind Cambage, the new President
of the Royal Society, is one of the last
men in Syd-
ney likely to
push in and
introduce him-
self; so this
little picture
comes in
handy. He is
a native of
Milton (N. S.
Wales), born
Nov. 7, 1559.
A surveyor, he
was for many
years engaged
in the mining
branch and
was president
of the Institu-
tion o f Sur-
veyors in 1907
onwards. At
present he is
Under-Sec. for
Mines, a coun-
cillor of most of the scientific societies,
a fellow of the Historical Society, a man
with a large interest in Australia’s birds
and beasts, and a whole library of infor-
mation about his native State’s vegetation.
The Bar has just lost big, handsome Alfred
Kelynaek, one of its brainiest and most popu-
lar members, to whose extraordinary good
nature and ever-ready help many young bar-
risters have owed much. A son of a one-
time principal of Newington, he was himself
for a Y’hile master at the North Shore C. of
E. Grammar School, but went back to the
’Varsity and graduated in Law in 1892.
After being assistant to the Parliamentary
draughtsman he took up practice on the
Common Law side, later specialising in Arbi-
tration work. In both branches he won dis-
tinction, and had illness not intervened he
would have been another Shand, whom he
resembled in appearance and impressiveness.
He was 58 at the end.
There is one Sydney' household which
knows something of the Communist troubles
that led up to the arrival of Mussolini and
his black-shirted Fascists on the Italian
stage. The widow of ex-M.H.R. G. B.
Edwards was in Europe with a daughter
when troubles fell thick on Italy, and in
England the daughter met the son of the
principal of big engineering w T orks at Turin
or thereabouts. The workers, afflicted for
the moment with Bolshevism, had taken
charge and driven the principal out. How-
ever, he was something of a philosopher: he
retired to his villa and waited for the sum-
mons which he reckoned, on Russian experi-
ence, w r as inevitable. It took a good while
to come; but when the factory had been run
to a standstill and there was no work for
the workmen, they decided that perhaps the
old way was best, after all. So father took
his brains and his experience back to the
works, and the son married the Sydney girl
and took her back to Italy, and Mrs. Edwards
returned lately to Australia, to settle down
presently in the Astor Flats in Macquarie-
street.
“Better reproductions in color of race-
horses in action and in ' rest have not
appeared in any book in recent years. There
are 24 plates and each of them is a delight
to lovers of thoroughbreds. ‘Finish of the
A.J.C. Craven Plate, 1918,’ is a really great
representation of the finish of a race.” This,
and more, says the London Times of the
work of Martin Stainforth, who is respon-
sible for most of the paintings of race-
horses repro-
duce d i u
“Racehorses in
Australia,”
edited by Dr.
Stewart
McKay, W. H.
Lang and
Ken Austin.
Sixteen years
ago Stainforth
came to Aus-
tralia for six
months’ vaca-
t i o n. For
almost a year
he jackerooed
on a northern
Queens land
station owned
by an uncle.
His menu dur-
ing that time
consisted o f
damper, , 1
brownie, tea, tough mutton and treacle.
This ceaseless variety palling, he brought
his jaded palate to Sydney on the way back
to England ; but the surf and the sunshine
proved too strong a call, and for 12 months
he threw his talents into the service of the
Lone Hand. Then a friendship with
Douglas Fry, at that time the leading
painter of horseflesh in Australia, turned
Martin’s thoughts towards the noble animal
as a subject for his brush; and so to-day
finds him in his Hunter-street studio doing
such work as the Times talks of.
The Welsh Choral Society put up a more
than creditable performance of Villiers Stan-
ford’s “Revenge” on Thursday night, in a
cavernous Town Hall wherein the occupant
of a seat felt like a castaway on a desert
island. Conductor E. H. Jones led his com-
pany to splendid heights of massed sound, to
the accompaniment of an orchestra led by
Mowat Carter and the organ at which Lilian
Frost officiated. A vocal quartet new to
concert-goers, “The Waifs,” put a genuine
laugh into the second part of the evening.
Nora Williamson —dad was lately medical
superintendent of the Parramatta Mental
Hospital—who learnt a good deal of what
she knows from fiddler Hoogstoel, is now
with her mother in Berlin. They first visited
Paris with a view to further study with
Jacques Thibaud, but that virtuoso was
touring in America, so they pushed on to
Berlin, where they found Carl Flesch, a
notable violinist with' a great teaching repu-
tation. Incidentally, he is a Hungarian.
Miss Williamson was accepted as a pupil at
once. To her surprise she found herselt tak-
ing some of her lessons from Alma Moody,
an Australian violinist, who made a name
in the concert world some years ago.
Violinist Raimund Pecliotsch got a loud
hand at the Con. the other night when he
returned to the concert platform after an
absence of nine years. The Czechoslovakian
Acting-Consul gave his patronage and pres-
ence, Raimund being a Bohemian; but as
far as could be ascertained no natives of
Hertzegovinia were in the audience. De-
spite the feeling of loss this must have given
him, the violinist played true to old form,
and his dexterous bow flung a Paganini Con-
certo off his fiddle with cheerful abandon
added to true musicianly feeling. Alfred
Hill, leading an orchestra of 20. added his
bit to the evening’s music. So did lyric Julia
Caroli and the artistic Arthur Appleby.
Pianist Rieke Parker struck a good idea
for her concert sit the Con. the other night.
As she walked on to the platform, off went
the lights in the auditorium, and the audi-
ence had the blessed relief of sitting in
shadow to luxuriate in the visions conjured
up by the music. Bach, Beethoven and
Chopin formed the principal fare provided
by the fragile-looking player, who discovered
undreamed-of depths of power. A garden
of flowers and lots of applause rounded off
the night.
Roy de Mestre goes off at the end of the
month on his two years’ rations from the
Society of Artists, and composer Roy Agnew
hopes to take the same track early in July.
His testimonial concert comes off at the
end of June, and organiser Mrs. Alec Gordon
is already smiling cheerfully over results.
At the last executive meeting somebody had
the brilliant idea of getting the outlying
suburbs interested through their Mayoresses.
The annual meeting of the Bush Book
Club was called for one afternoon last week,
and as the rendezvous was made at Govern-
ment House the roll-up was enormous. Dame
Margaret was in the chair, and spoke, among
other matters, of the necessity for advertis-
ing the club. Professor Tasman Lovell made
one of his quick, brilliant speeches done up
in the fashionable psychological wrapper, in
which he discoursed on the six stages of lone-
liness that can assail the human breast. Bar-
bara Knox, still under the influence of her
role as poetaster Lady Patricia, added a few
remarks rounded off with poetical quotations.
Secretary Beulah Bolton, quietly capable as
ever, handled reports and showed restrained
pride when mentioning that over 1000 books
had been sent out this year—and Heaven
and the doctors alone know what that must
have meant to the sick and sorry dweller in
bark hut or corrguted-iron humpy.
W. Hall Jones, knight, formerly Maori-
land’s High Commissioner in London and
one of the best-preserved politicians of his
age, is over from the Ferny Isles. Neuritis,
in spite of his healthy exterior, is bothering
him, and he is staying at a peanut sana-
torium on the north side of Sydney’s big
blue pond.
The other night, when Gordon Brady was
leaving brother-in-law Ernest Watt’s house
after a rehearsal of “Lady Patricia,” the
local policeman thought he looked more like
a burglar than a gardener. Anyway, P.C.
0651 insisted on investigating the young
man’s suit-case, and, still disbelieving that
his intentions were honorable, escorted him
back to the establishment for the cook to
identify him.
Just returned to Sydney, carrying in her
train an Indian ayah and small baby, Han-
bury Davies’s daughter Mrs. Greig, who used
to be Gwen Davies —she fluffed a good deal
in amateur theatricals before her marriage
to a soldier in Bombay. Colombo is her
home town now.
Miss Ethel Trouton, great friend of the
Bush Book Club and of the Rawson Insti-
tute, has been putting up a brave fight
against double pneumonia at her Double
Bay flat.
Entries close for the Riverina Eisteddfod
on September 1; the musical and other
noisesome contests will be held at Wagga
from September 25 to October 1. Copies of
the syllabus can be had from secretary H. P.
Wickham, Wagga.
A Brisbane postscript:—
The Governor, with Captain Hammond abeam, has
gone north by the Kahowna. He left Brisbane
under the shelter of the Union Jack, and as the
boat puffed out red, white and blue streamers
connected him with friends on shore. His Ex. left
the steamer at Mackay to hobnob for an hour with
the City Councillors, look in at the School of Arts
and say how d’ye to the inmates of the new hospi-
tal. He doesn’t expect to get back before May 17.
Before his northern flight his Ex. sat on the
platform in the Exhibition concert-hall with Uni.
dons, Parson Merrington, Col. Thynne, Dr. W. N.
Robertson, Freda Bage and the Registrar of the ’Var-
sity. The Registrar’s spouse, just back from Mel-
bourne, was in the body of the hall, where were
also Mrs. Pitt Rivers and Capt. Hammond, Judge
O’Sullivan and Marjorie Ricardo. Many flags like-
wise witnessed the conferring of degrees; and in
the evening those who attended the eommem. dinner
were 200 strong.
On the same night Lena Hammond, in cherry
color with black and gold brocade, and Gladys
Frost, in maize and silver with an unexpected touch
of blue, captured the Albert Hall and the audience
with their recital. Among those who sat before a
stage adorned with prize chrysanthemums were
the Gilbert Wilson and Sandford Jackson matrons.
The Queensland Press Institute has eaten the first
luncheon of the season. E. E. Edwards, a director
of the Brisbane Telegraph, succeeds Spencer Browne
in the presidential chair, and among those who
sipped the soup were Tom Heney and his wife,
Preston Day (who has been hon. sec. for some time
and now carries off a gold-mounted fountain-pen to
Cloncurry), the C. E. Sligos, Mrs. M. Forrest, T. J.
McMahon and Allan Collard. One lunch a month
was voted for by the abstemious gathering.
Harry Lauder has been trotting inimitably round
the stage at His Majesty’s. On the 3rd a bulging
house justified a long programme. The Scotchbv-
terian Kirk sent many members of the ministry,
and among others were Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, the
Grant Hanlons, George Henderson, Billy Maloney and
a gallery full of Macs. A reception was given at
the Bellevue to Harry’s Men’s, whereat the Ferguson
lassie, wi’ all the medals, danced, and the audience
sang wi’ Harry as a grand finale.
John Wren is getting the credit of placing a new
co. in Cremorne to startle Brisbane with “Midnight
Frolics.’’

Twenty
Years
Younger
Time was when this
man went home from
work tired out. His
daily work indoors, with
insufficient open air and
no physical exercise ex-
cept a week-end round of
golf or a walk, left him
weary and only fit for bed.
The reason is not far to
seek. Sedentary work in-
doors, the lot of the aver-
age man, and many
women too, puts a strain
upon the system.
This affects some people
very vitally. Without
physical exercise and open
air the system gets slug-
gish. Liver and kidneys,
particularly sensitive to
these conditions, don’t
work actively enough, so
impurities get into the
blood. Depression, head-
aches, “fits of the blues,’’
nervy temper follow. You
don t feel ill, but still you
don’t feel fine and well.
Consequently your work
is a burden instead of a
pleasure. Yet the remedy
is simple. Every morning
put a little pinch of Krus-
chen Salts into your
breakfast cup of tea.
uM<

Kruschen Salts are not
like any other salts. You
can t taste them if you
take them in tea, but they
do a world of good. They
tone up the liver and kid-
neys so that these organs
perform their functions
as Nature intended —
actively, thoroughly; they
cleanse the blood of all
impurities. Fresh, clear
blood circulates all over
your body, bringing new
health, new life to every
fibre of the system. Your
mind is keener, you feel
more active, your work
feels like play.
This is the simple discov-
ery thousands of men and
women have made. Krus-
chen Salts have restored
their systems to active
health. They have become
vigorous, enthusiastic,
keener physically and men-
tally. As one man says:
Now 1 am never tired in
body or mind, and can en-
joy a joke with the young-
est. Indeed, it has knocked
twenty years off my age
(58).”

There was nothing to startle the dress-
reporters at Her Majesty’s on Saturday, but
a carefully stage-managed entrance by Gladys
Moncrieff and suite was given a salvo of
cheers, and put the “gods” in good fettle
for the rest of the evening. Gladys trailed
to an O.P. box, where a buzzing manager
had arranged a public handshake with Arthur
Stigant, who later retired into semi-obscurity
in the circle. Gladys, dressed in black, and
entrenched in bouquets, most of which she
afterwards fired at favorites in the line-up
of the finale, beamed like a Just-Out. Her
girlish, unaffected radiance kept the eye
off her undistracting retinue. She was not
the hit of the disturbance, however. Nel!
Payne, in lettuce-green that strait-jacketed
her young figure from the bust to the waist
and then panniered out in a sort of Japanese
tea-house effect, was a fetching wench that
made many a sophisticated heart beat faster.
Kathlyn Hilliard, wearing a wig that caused
one to look nervously for the chemical fife-
extinguisher, stuck to a clinging white robe,
very reminiscent of Tittell Brune in the
bed'sheet of the succulent Kundry in “Parsi-
fal.” Emmeline Orford’s thatch also threat-
ened to blister the paint on her face, but she
had a fine reception, marked by the efforts
of her husband, Edwin Brett, to beat the
clamor with a solo on his own broad palms.
Acting-State Gov. Irvine and his family
had hardly finished showering blessings on
daughter Beatrice and her Apple Islander
when a further call for felicitations was
sounded by the dame’s brother, Col. Wanliss,
now chief dispenser of justice at Rabaul.
After several lonely years of widowerhood
he is sentencing himself to a second term of
matrimony with Muriel, the younger daugh-
ter of the late medico-Colonel Bryant. The
bride-elect is a dark-eyed, auburn-haired
charmer, who, with her sister Bronnie, was
reared in Toorak, where their father flew
his brass plate before he went to the war.
The medico’s health broke under the strain
on the other side,, and the “Last Post”
sounded for him when he got back to Mel-
bourne after the Armistice.
By the time Gaud Mayor Swanson gives
his annual ball in August, he should be get-
ting used to the title which is pretty certain
to reach him on June 2, the eve of George
Rex’s birthday.
She still keeps marching on. Kathleen
Gilman Jones, the cultured Cambridge pro-
duct who is principal of Merton Hall (Girls’
Anglican Grammar School), presided over
the Council of Public Education at its last,
meeting. Attired in a tailor-made costume
that was neither fawn nor grey but some-
thing in between, and wearing her hat, Miss
Vice-president treated her fellow-members
with at least as much respect as she would
her very top class. Her polite satire as she
read proposed regulations of the Board of
Health about sage-green walls and black-
boards that must be black was more scorch-
ing than any man could have applied. She
will be quite a change from Frank Tate,
the President, now in the Cold Land.
Mrs. James Alston, as president of our
10 associated cr&ches, spread an afternoon-
tea frivol for her sister council-members at
the Wattle the other day. She smiled her
welcomes from under a soft halo of feathers
on a toque brim of velvet that matched her
mole-colored tailorings vested with silvery
brocade. The tables blazed with Iceland
poppies, and the cakes and ices tempted the
less cautious to forget the meal ahead. The
star guests were Alfred Deakin’s widow, who
pioneered the crfeche movement here;
Mrs. Jack Earle, who has helped it along
from the jump, as hon. sec. and vice-presi-
dent; Katie Conway, niece of Watterstoin,
of the Argus, who controls the Edward Wil-
son trust fund; Mrs. E. F. Allan and Mrs. R.
Randall (all vice-presidents) ; also Miss
Ethel Munce, whose late mother helped to
organise the movement, and Mrs. Pat
McCauley. The council, by the way, is
now sending out an SOS for money to en-
able it to extend operations. Port Melbourne
and Footscray call for crhches; so does St.
Kilda.
A young Hebrew matron recently acted as
matron of honor at a Christian wedding in
St. Kilda-road, whereat the officiating cleric
was a popular bishop. She was carefully
told beforehand that when his Gaiters
addressed her she must be sure to address
him as “your Grace” or “my Gord.” During
the ceremony she listened with wide-eyed
attention to the service till a reference _to
the blessings of the Lord brought her mind
galloping back to her instructions. Subse-
quently the genial bishop congratulated the
lady on her part in the shivoo. She made
one frantic effort to remember; then splut-
tered, “Th-thank you, my God !”
There has been mourning for an amateur
theatrical light of other days—Spencer
Edward Holroyd, a younger son of the late
knighted Judge. He was longtime associate
to his learned pater, had a fund of stories
of the time when quite the best people used
to make occasional appearances in first-class
plays, and himself was among the stage-
struck elect. But it was his brother Arthur
who acted in “The Palace of Truth” ever so
long ago, the chief comedian being Gieut.-
Colonel Brownrigg, military commandant.
Holroyd was even more at home on the deck
of a yacht than on the boards of a full-sized
theatre, though he once did a w T eek right off
at the Princess’s. It was when "Gelamine”
was played, with the Earl of Shaftesbury
as the tenor hero, and Rose Musgrove as the
amateur heroine, she not having yet assumed
the professional status. Poor Holroyd had
the part of the Village Idiot, and he used to
say he felt his character keenly.
The Warrnambool races drew a record
crowd. The Edmund Thornley and G. A.
White matrons dispensed tea and cake on
the opening afternoon at the Manifold Tea
House, which was tricked out with red
berries and blossoms; and next day Mrs. li.
Affleck, Mrs. S. F. Mann and Mrs. Jack
Moffat combined to hostess a glad tea-pour-
ing. All three wore inky hangings which
served to show that one black frock is not
very like another. The big thrill for the
younger brigade was the Wnrrnambool Club
ball, which bounded cheerfully in the drill
hall. The cream of the county was there,
of course, including some of the young
bloods from the Retired Indian Army Officer
settlement, who are find ng life decidedly
cheerful with hospitable homesteads to right
and left of them and polo for those who can
run it.
Prof. Agar’s popular wife handed the Mer-
maid Society’s secretarial duties to an under-
study early last week, so that she could
devote her ’ attention to the brand-new baby
daughter which the Stork' had deposited on
the family doorstep at Ivew.
The Ted Mitchells have closed down their
Macedon shack for the cold season, and are
sheltering in the Richard Lintons’ South
Yarra homestead at the hilly end of Ken-
sington-road. The legal knight received
word from overseas the other day of the
death of his widowed sister Mary. She was
the youngest of the late S’William Mitchell’s
four daughters, married an Englishman
named Dobbie about 20 years ago, and settled
in the Fog For some years past she had been
anxious to return to her native Australia,
but was prevented by ill-health. Sister
Gaetitia, who also drifted to England in the
’nineties, lately spent a year or so w T ith her
own folk in this State.
Pegg Clarke’s camera shot this profile of
artist Nora Gurdon, daughter ~f a Brighton
medico, whose latest canvases have been
decorating the walls of the Athenaeum show-
room. Miss Gurdon, one of Bernard Hall’s
brightest pupils at the National Gallery, had
hard luck when
she went to
the Fog for a
course of Old
World study,
as she had
hardly un-
packed her
palette when
the guns began
to shoot. She
thereupon ex-
changed her
painting pinny
for a nurse’s
apron, and
gave a hand
in caring for
wounded Poi-
lus across the
Channel. But
her artistic
yearnings were
not altogether
stifled, as she
did some painting (otherwise than with
iodine) at odd moments with much success,
and it was with sketches thus snatched in
intervals from war-working that this Mel-
bourne paintress was able to make an inter-
esting show when she got back.
Dr. Doris Veale, a youthful Blighty
medico, who, on a trip to Australia last
year, was tempted to change her name by
Ernest Officer, of the Riverina clan, land ’d
back the other day from a lightning trip to
the Fog with her steamer trunks filled with
trousseau chiffonery, and a brother to hand
her over to her squatter bridegroom.
The dear old Women’s League gathered
in its official parlors on Friday afternoon to
extend a hand to ex-President Mrs. Fred
Hughes, just back from a rush across. the
globe, with an interval on the sick list in
N’York. Floral trophies reinforced the other
evidences of joy at seeing the matron again.
President Mrs. Crocker and the Weedon
dame spoke welcoming pieces, and in return
the guest had a word to say about women’s
activities on the other s.de of the equator.
Tenor Coscia and his wife and Margaret
Jones released a flow of song; after which
the teacups rattled cheerily.
The William Baillieus farewelled the
Clive Baillieu pair on Thursday night with
bridge and jazz at Heathfield, their Tooiak
place. Lady Stanley, in silvery embroi-
deries shining against an inky background,
was the star guest. Mrs. Baillieu was but-
tressed in black, with gold embellishments.
Daughter Amy fluttered in rosy swath.ngs,
and sister Claire suggested a violet in
mauve, while Mrs. Clive moved round in
white silk engraved with silver like an
elabbrate wedding-card.
Here is poet Frank Wilmot, better known
to Bulletin readers as “Furnley Maurice,”
who is about to publish a book of essays
under the title of “Romance” —his first
volume of prose after eight of verse. Wil-
mot, who is the son of H. W. Wilmot, one
of Labor’s pioneers, has steadily stuck to
the path of
literature
whilst follow-
ing the bread-
and-butter job
of bookseller.
An admirer of
other people’s
fine writing,
but dark and
silent about
his own, he
has been con-
nected with
most of Mel-
bourne’s young
literary move-
ments. With
his own press
he has printed
the work of
several writ-
er s which
otherwise
would have
not seen the light, and he has devoted to the
task a; lot of the leisure which he might
have spent blazing another trail on Parnas-
sus. Few have been so unselfish in pushing
the achievements of competitors under the
noses of the public.
The Victoria League, which is low on its
financial side, will have its coffers replen-
ished by a bridge-party on the afternoon and
evening of May 22 at the Bertie Austins’
Toorak place, E-ilyer, where the takings will
be reinforced by the sale of sweets and
flowers. Mrs. Lascelles, of Melbourne Man-
sions. and Miss Elsa Grice, of Coolullah,
Hawksburn, have the matter of reserving
tables in hand.
Hugh Paton, head of the Paton Advertis-
ing Service, and a personage of some tonnage
among his brethren of the craft, left Mel-
bourne for America the other day. Paton
is a member of the Melbourne Rotary Club,
and has been delegated Australian represen-
tative at an international pow-wow some-
where in the U.S. After that .he goes to
England, and, if he has time, will take a
hurried look at the Botch on the Rhine.
With the double-barrelled object of swell-
ing their maintenance tund and obliging the
patients, staff and visitors, the Alfred Plos-
pital has launched a shop at the entrance
gates. Relays of volunteer girls behind
the counter dispense anything from tinned
foods and hairbrushes to pins and bootlaces
from 9 a.m. till the hospital curfew tolls the
parting day. Mrs. James Angus is in com-
mand of the very active committee which
runs the sales. But there is no visible rea-
son why the place should be called “The
Boutique.” If they will insist on _ being
Frenchy, what’s wrong with “La Boutique” V
Hon. sec. Mrs. Quinnell signals from
the Austral Salon to the effect that a
benefit concert is being arranged for singer
Coscia and his musical wife, at the end of
the month, to help the pair back to Italy.
The Hennessy lady presides over the little
group running the show.
The half-yearly sale of the Gentlewoman’s
Aid Society scored another sucess in the
Prahran Civic Plall on Friday afternoon.
President Mrs. Tremearne spoke the opening
piece as understudy to the Irvine dame, who
was sick. For nearly 80 years this society,
of which Miss Ethel Flower is sec., has
helped the poor and the sick who, haying
known better days, shrink from being objects
of charity ; and, besides the sales, it secures
orders for workers to enable them to earn
their crusts, “work, not alms,” being the
desire of the gentlewomen with whom the
society deals. A battalion of the best peop’e
humped home huge parcels and empty purses
on Friday. Among the busy saleswomen
were the George Armytage, E. Lascelles,
Mein, H. Umphelby and J. C. Syme mat-
rons, and the Misses Bayles, Kiddle, God-
frey, Nyulasy, Marnie Clarke and Kathleen
MacMick.ng.
The fourth Civil Ambulance Guild Ball will
whirl in the St. Kilda Town Hall on June
13 as “The Bevel of a Thousand Lanterns
—the suggestion of the Tallis dame, who
is in command of the decorations, lhe hall
will be curtained in with balloons and lan-
terns and further gladdened by a lantern
procession, in which Lady Forbes Kobert-
son and other stage lights will reinforce the
illuminations. The decoration group has
harvested a sheaf of cheques to pay tor the
hall dressings, and other branches are tired
with a desire to do likewise. To this end
Melbourne’s Mayoress will help foot the
catering account with a card afternoon in
the civic hall on Friday afternoon next,. The
committee is bulging with social heavj-
weights. Gertrude Rennie is hon. organisei.
Lieut.-Gov. Irvine gave the show away at
the conference of Ministers of Agriculture.
In “opening” the corroboree (22 hours after
it had started to function) he said that the
Agricultural Department had, very thought-
fully, prepared a speech for him, packed with
facts and figures and adorned with an exor-
dium and peroration. It was very fine, no
doubt, but he was not using any of it. He
preferred “a bit of his own,” as Bent used
to say. After this the public will be more
than ever convinced that Ministers are
gramophones wound up to grind out the
records of the silent rulers.
On Friday night Music Club members
turned up at the Artists’ Society galleries
to listen to an agreeable programme of
’cello solos by Dallas Fraser. The young
English player was in yellow silk outlined
on the upper deck with brown fur ; and her
mother, who is shepherding her chick on her
Aussie trip, beamed approval from a sea of
black georgette which surged in a silvery
wave about the collar-bones.
A little gossip from Adelaide: —
The St. Peter’s College sports were watched by
proud parents who mostly sheltered from the heat
beneath their motor hoods, but short-skirted flappers
in Scores strolled about with trails of youthful
admirers. Their Exes, bade all and sundry to tea in
a vast marquee, and the “head” took a favored few
into the cool quiet of his own house for the same
meal. The Murrays—staunch supporters of the blue-
and-white —kept an eye oh things from the reserved
enclosure. Prizes were dispensed by Mrs. Bussell,
wife of the Archdeacon who has been associated with
the college from its very early days.
Septimus Power and his wife are here for a fort-
night’s spell before the former goes back to his
canvas and brushes in Melbourne. Power says that
one of his favorite horse-models is Digger, ridden
by General Birdwood when he was here, and an exem-
plary “sitter.”
Since 1893, when the Angas Wing was opened, the
Children’s Hospital has had a lien on May Day, when
it stages a special festival. An amazing collection
of stuff comes in, from flannel shirts to sacks cf
sugar, and a tea tent is run on the lawn. This
year’s show was in charge of the Duncan lady, Miss
Kate Hill, and the F, J. Downer, S. H. Weston, Max
Fotheringham and T. W. Fleming matrons.
The Orpheus Society’s second concert of the sea-
son, at the Town Hall, found the usual enthusiastic
house waiting to applaud it. The new conductor,
John Dunn, was in charge, and the chief soloists
were Leslie Coultas (whose singing of “The Turtle
Dove,” with a humming accompaniment by the
Society, was the star item of the evening), Vera
Thrush, F. Williamson and Cyril Bradley.
Mrs. Lavington Bonython hostessed an at-home
to farewell her younger sister, Miss Kathleen Warren,
who, after marrying Lieut. Codrington-Forsyth, will
leave for the Fog.
A trio of dances has happened—one at Burnside in
aid of that suburb’s School for Mothers; another at
the Charles Todds’ in North Adelaide, and the third
at the ’Varsity. The Burnside one was a committee
affair, run by a dozen or so hostesses, and among the
dancers was Laurel Lawrence, who’d had her very
own 21st birthday-party a few days before. The
’Varsity ball had its usual bunch of debs. —23 of ’em.
Lady Bridges is still in Sydney, but with the
Governor were Chief Justice and Miss Murray, Prof.
Mitchell and his good-looking daughter, the Moulden
lady, Captain and Mrs. Medley, and MisS Judge.
The Christian Brothers are going out into the
suburbs, like all the other “colleges.” The old E. T.
Smith mansion, the Acacias, was lately secured as a
girls’ school; now the Wakefield-street site, held since
la 18, is to be given up in favor of Rostrevor an
estate of 40 acres adjoining the Morialta waterfall-
reserve, apd the old home of J. S. Reid, the ex-
newspaper mining man.
Although Adelaide has women barristers, women
j’s.P. and women police, the swish of a petticoat
is never heard at meetings of the Uni. Law Students
Society. The misogynists who founded that body
provided in the constitution that members must be
of the sex that uses safety-razors. There are five
skirted students at Adelaide’s Law School, and an
insidious attempt has been made from within the
society to break down the protecting barrier. How-
ever, when the test came a four-to-one majority
was in favor of maintaining it, so the society will
continue to smoke its pipe in peace without being
disturbed by the scented cigarettes of the new
woman.

PROPERLY
For the third time in four years the Murray
Bridge (S'.A.) crew have won the inter-State boatrace.
They were victorious at Brisbane in 1920, on the
Parramatta in 1922, and on the Swan last Monday,
and no one will now dispute their right to represent
the Commonwealth at the Olympic Games. Owing to
another visitation of the wild autumn weather
which interfered with training operations, the pro-
ceedings were postponed from Saturday afternoon to
Monday morning; nevertheless, 30,000 people watched
the race from the decks of river craft, the South
Perth shore and King’s Park heights. The West-
r a Cans led for about two miles, but half-a-mile from
home the Croweaters drew level and, forging ahead
over the last bit, they won, all out, by half-a-
length, with the Victorians two lengths behind the
Gropers, N. S. Wales a fair fourth, and Tasmania
last. The time (16min. 31sec.) was slow, consider-
ing the calm water. A. G. Bull, the good-looking
Leichhardt (N.S.W.) sculler, easily retained the
championship he won on his home waterway last
year, and a four-oared race for long-haired rowers
was annexed by South Oss. But competitive boat-
pulling is not a game for girls, and these contests
should be discouraged.
♦ + • •
Every kind of craft that would float and
carry a passenger was seen on the Parramatta River
last Saturday, -and the banks were never more popu-
lous. The attraction was the final of the G.P.S.
eights, an event that grows amazingly in popularity.
A desperate race resulted in Sydney Grammar winning
by half-a-length from Newington College, with St.
Joseph’s a length and a quarter away in third place,
and “Shore,” the favorites, last. “Shore,” it tran-
spired, had put everything they had into winnirg
their heat: that feat they performed brilliantly, but
most of the boys were greatly distressed on returning
to their shed, and the pace set by New’ington and
Sydney Grammar in the final proved too much for
them. The 11-rnile course was covered in Bmin.
15sec. Grammar, who were stroked by R. Caswell,
a lOst. 41b. boy (No. 5, F. E. Jennings, goes 13st.
lllb.), won the race last year, and have carried it
off IX times altogether. The first fours went to
“Shore,” who were followed home by King’s, St.
Joseph’s and St. Ignatius’ ; the second fours to St.
Joseph’s, from “Shore,” King’s and Sydney Grammar.
All the races were fought out in a fine sporting
spirit. There is no political or sectarian bias on
the river.
“Fax”: The head-of-the-river race be-
tween Melbourne and Geelong public schools is ex-
ceptionally interesting this year. On paper there is
little hope of final victory for Wesley and Xavier
against Melbourne Grammar, Scotch College or the
better of the two Geelong crews. Wesley are only
a stone heavier than Xavier, but the lightest of the
others are fully three stone weightier than Wesley,
whilst Scotch, the bulkiest of the lot, are stated to
have an advantage of 10 stone over Xavier. The
light and the heavy of it meet in the third heat on
Friday, Melbourne and Wesley having to open the
proceedings. The final, between the three heat-win-
ners, is timed for 3 p.m. on Saturday, and if the
weather be kind the crowd on the banks will be
great. Weight doesn’t go for everything in a
racing-boat, but the axiom that a good heavy crew
must beat a good light one holds true as ever. That
is, if the word “good” be taken to mean well-
balanced, not less than well-trained. In this respect
Scotch depart from old traditions of proper “dress-
mg” of an eight-oar boat. The stroke of the “all
reds” is positively lighter, apparently, than the bow,
whereas in Melbourne Grammar, Geelong Grammar
and Xavier the distribution of poundage is in accord-
ance with old rules of the game. Assuming that all
the crews are about equal in individual toughness and
unity of. swing, the championship should go to Mel-
bourne Grammar.

After saying (1) that he wouldn’t go to
America twith the Davis Cup team unless the Lawn
tennis Council provided his partner with a substi-
tute, (2) that he wouldn’t dream of a public sub-
scriptions—“no decent fellow would,” and (3) that
he would waive his objection to a public subscrip-
tion, J. O. Anderson announced last week that he
was ready to embark on the Council’s terms. Before
the young man arrived at this magnanimous decision
the hat had been hawked round Sydney with dread-
fully disappointing results. The position now is
that Anderson, Hawkes, Mclnnes and Schlesinger
w.ll go forth and conquer, or be conquered, in
America, and the first-named, who has been appointed
captain, will presumably get a free trip to Wimble-
don into the bargain. But the Anderson incident
and the Clemenger-Brookes wrangle have set people
wondering how much of this Davis Cup business is
sport and how much advertisement for bustling
youths in the sporting-goods trade.
* * * *
“Linesman”: The appointment of Schles-
inger to a. place in the Davis Cup team shows the
recognition that will come to a young fellow after
a temporary outburst of superior form at a by no
means representative tournament. It is true that
he beat Patterson, but I feel sure that result was
due to the big fellow playing the wrong game with
a new American steel-framed racquet. 1 have no
desire to disparage Schlesinger’s performances
against O’Hara Wood and Wertheim at the same
meeting, but how he can be regarded as of Davis Cup
calibre is beyond me to explain. He has no striking
shots beyond a strong drive, which, unlike the
sizzling fOrehand slap of Californian Billy Johnston,
with whiph it has been foolishly compared, is not
a point i winner. Sehlesinger’s shot wants more
accuracy j and direction, though one, is bound to
admit that he sometimes bangs them effectively
down the side lines. But the chief feature cf
Schlesinger is that he is a baseline slugger, whose
impotence: against a net-rusher of the O’Hara Wood
standard Iwas proved in the first two sets of the
final at the aforesaid tournament. When you reckon
that his service is undistinguished as compared with
Olemenger’s, and that his equipment is inferior to
Mclnnes’s or Hone’s, the sudden glory thrust upon
him is a little unaccountable.
* ■» * *
“15-30”: If young Clemenger did nothing
for himself by going- to Melbourne and meeting
Mclnnes and Schlesinger he at least delivered a
blow at the habit of appointing one man as selector
of the Davis Cup team. His suggestion that the
Lawn Tennis Association should folldw the cricket
authorities in appointing three selectors, one each
from Vie., N.S.W. and South Oss, should meet with
the approval of everybody not infected with the
legend of Norman Brookes’s infallibility as a judge
of the game. Brookes, in this instance, has been
found guilty of forgetting Clemenger’s advance
since the November championships in Melbourne.
No amount of prejudiced writing by the claque of
Brookes boomsters in the Melbourne papers can pal-
liate the effect of his late-hour decision to give the
young Ma Stater a try-out with Mclnnes and
Schlesinger. The result of that encounter showed
that Clemenger was at least as good as either of
the Victorian colts, but had Brookes changed his
mind in favor of the enthusiastic visitor it would
have been an admission of tardy misjudgment, as
damaging to his pontifical authority as his sudden
readiness to have Clemenger over. He didn’t change
his mind. Norman can be acquitted of bias, but I
question whether he will ever a train be sole selector.
Since the part-
nership with Australia
was severed Maoriland
hasn’t taken part in
the contests for the
Davis Cup. When it
docs the amiable youth
here maltreated in
black and white is
sure to be one of its
representatives, if
available. He is
Arthur Sims, the M.L.
white hope. During
his recent visit to
Sydney the speed and
pre< ision of Sitns’s
work with the racquet
impressed all the old
hands. Though not
yet in the first-class
he will get there some
day if he sticks to
the game.
Tilden and John-
ston have struck some
surprising snags in the
U.S. lately. At Brook-
lyn Tilden suffered
the unprecedented in-
sult of ** being finished
off in three straight
sets by Dean Mather,
a man who does not
figure on the Ameri-
can ranking list, and
is quite unknown on
this side of the world.
A little while later the
same player, partnered
by the burly Wash-
burn, who was put
in Australia in
1920-21, knocked out Tilden and Warner in a match
on covered courts, Tilden arid his pal capturing a
whole five games in three sets. Another white hope',
Harvey Snodgrass, belted Johnston in a three-set
match at Los Angeles, but the record in this case was
more respectable, the Californian champion register-
ing 4—6, 6—3, 6 —B. When Johnston took on
Griffin in a doubles bout with the Kinsey brothers,
who are probably the second-best pair in the lgnd
of synthetic grog, the Kinseys whisked home by
three sets to two. As the brothers have also played
well in other championships, Uncle Sam might seri-
ously consider their possibilities for the doubles in
the Davis Cup challenge round. Tilden and John-
ston, who will probably figure in the singles once
more, can’t be classed as world-beaters in the full
court game.
Saturday was a damp day in Adelaide, and
it was a day of surprises at the Morphettville races. On
paper nothing looked to have a chance against King
Ingoda and Crusader in the nine-furlong Elder Stakes,
w.i.a., but neither galloped kindly in the mud, and the
little-fancied four-year-old gelding Margoon (Beragoon-
Marie Hall) won as he liked from the well-performed
Westralian mare Sweet Dpris and Benoni. Margoon
is owned and trained by one of the Rasheeds, who
are plucky buyers of horses and think nothing of
taking them a thousand miles or so to a bush
meeting; and another member of the family landed
the S.A. Stakes with Pistolano and the Fisher Handi-
cap with Castleton, both the progeny of Pistol.
Armada, another Pistol, won the St. Leger, in whicn
the favorite, Recitation, made no show, but was pro-
bably lucky to beat the badly-left Paivista, and
though the weight anchored St. Speed and Lisnavane
in the Coodwood Handicap, it didn’t stop the
strongly-built Denacre. Despite his 9st. 31b. and his
bad position early in the race the black son of
Linacre-Lady Denman finished well Clear of Golden
Cock and St. Roseate, and returned his backers
£l2 Bs. for every £1 invested. On his day Den-
acre is a good horse. He wasn’t at his best when he
visited Sydney during the summer, albeit he ex-
hibited flashes of pace.
*-»*«•
When the going is good at Rand wick the
jockey that tries to win all the way generally ends
up nearer last than first. Unless the horse has
exceptional speed or exceptional stamina he tires to
nothing in the long straight. But sometimes the
slatherum-whack method of riding answers when it
™ s , underfoot. It came off in two cases at the
Tattersnll’s Club meeting—those of Mirthmaker
(Comedy King-Stranraer) in the 11-furlong Winter
Stakes, and Vaccine (S'eremond-Mii robe) in the
mile Welter. Both were rank outsiders, having dis-
appointed the public on numerous occasions since
they were liighly-thought-of two-year-olds, but con-
sidering that Vaccine had won in fair company at
Warwick Farm a week before, his price (16 to 1
in the ring and 21) to 1 on the tote) was surpris-
ingly liberal. Vaccine and Mirthmaker seem to be
horses that will only do their best in heavy going.
Which doesn’t necessarily mean that they are squibby.
* * * *
‘‘O.K.”: The V.R.C.’s decision to raise
the fee of final acceptances for the Melbourne Cup,
from £5O to £75, is a reform that was overdue.
The race is worth £lO,OOO to the winner, with nice
plump consolation stakes for second and third, and if
the final acceptance were increased to £lOO it would
still be a reasonable demand to make. A horse whose
owner will not be glad to get odds of 100 to 1, on
better than “concession” terms (i.e., 20 and 10 to 1
for places) is clearly not good enough for
the job. Any pretence that a horse nott worth
backing for £lOO on the club’s conditions is running
“on the off chance” seems too thin. Its presence
in the field will henceforth invite suspicion more
grave than in the past. Except in rare instances of
owners who want to be represented in a Melbourne
Cup field, and don’t care what they pay for their
fancy, the starting of a rank duffer —a proved non-
stayer, or a horse of inferior class —will look un-
sportsmanlike, to sajy the least of it. The animal
with no chance of a win or a place, can only help
make trouble in the field. Its mission, if it has
one, is conceivably interference with a favorite.
Stipendiary stewards ought to be in a position to
watch the “dud” animal all the way round, or as far
as it can get before its power for mischief is ex-
hausted. But whilst the final acceptance cost was
being raised, why didn’t the V.R.C. committee raise
the nomination from £2 to £3?
* * * *
“O.Iv.”: Time has had a lot to say in
the sporting affairs of Lord Rosebery, who figures
as owner of Ellangowan, winner of the English Two
Thousand Guineas. Why, he scored a second in the
English Derby of 1871 with a colt called Couronne
de Fer. It is nearly 40 years since Rosebery
visited Australia with his wife, Hannah de Roths-
child, and remarked that seme of the local rich sat
on 60-guinea chairs in their homes to look at 60-
shilling- oleographs. Ellangowan is the third horse
to bear the Rosebery colors (rose and primrose
hoops) to the fore in the Guineas, and the Liberal
peer has won three Derbies, one with Ladas in 1894,
the year when he was Prime Minister.

The dropping of a hand-battery by a
jockey on Helena Vale (W.A.) racecourse suggests
that examination of the jockey, rather than the
horse, ought to happen in suspicious cases. Stewards
look for the cause of a horse’s nervousness in the
sputum or sweat of the animal, when perchance a
fear of what the boy is, or isn’t, going to do, may
account for its profuse perspiration or foaming at the
mouth. Doubtless a horse that has once suffered an
electric shock in a race is always expecting another
when the colors are up. It can never feel certain
that the jockey is out to lose, not to win. The
poor wretch is scared before it gets to the starting
gate.

Billy Grime, the N.S.W. featherweight.
who, 18 months ago, was merely a raw country pug
and is now champion in his class, has had another
win in Melbourne at Jack Green’s expense. Jack, a
light of other days as far as 20-rounders are con-
cerned, can still box a brilliant 10 rounds, but the
grimly-persistent Grime, who has developed a punch,
had him going in the eighth and stopped him in the
12th. Or, rather, the referee did.
* * * *
Two untrained featherweights, Bobby
Gray and Billy Woods, scrambled through 20 dreary
rounds at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, Gray
getting the decision on points. The infliction was
an eleventh-hour substitute for an Evans-Semmens
mill, Evans being unable to fight owing to his
mother’s illness and Semmens unwilling to meet
Woods for little glory and less gilt. In this the
Melbourne pug showed himself wiser than the man-
agement who foisted two unfit boys on the public at
the usual rates, though only a few hundreds failed
to see through the joke.

“Kid” Lewis, the English boxer, who went
from Australia to America just before the war and
stayed with Unde until it was safe to travel, was
sued lately in London by a motor-tyre dealer for
£3B. The lawyer on the other side declared that
Lewis had received £4OOO cash for a recent fight
(win or lose —and he lost), and was earning £lBO
a w r eek by exhibitions at the music-halls. Probably
this was an exaggeration ; but the Court called his
conduct “disgraceful,” and ordered imprisonment if
the debt was not paid. The “Kid” threatens to
come to Australia again, but he will get no £4OOO,
win, lose or draw T , in these parts.
About 27,000 enthusiasts crowded into the
Fitzrov ground on Saturday to see whether Carlton
would' down last season’s premiers. They didn’t.
Carlton went off with a rush and scored five dean
goals before Fitzroy got a move on, and the Maroons
barrackers were doleful. But after the first change
’Rov smartened up, steadily overhauled the Blues, and
won out with 79 points to Carlton’s 56. Latter were
somewhat sluggish, had little system and their
usually splendid high marking almost vanished. Ihe
Maroons were quicker, had decent organisation and
used their wits to better purpose. Another huge
mob pushed into the South Melbourne ground, where
the local team met Gollingwood. The latter have
lost many men in recent years —seven of their old
players are captaining other League and Ass. clubs
—but their system takes no account of individual
players, wherefore they had little trouble in dis-
posing of “Sowth,” notwithstandh g the coaching of
last year’s Magpie centre, Rami am. At the close
’Wood owned 16 goals 5 behinds to South’s 12 goals
7 behinds. Casualties, though not serious, were
many, the grounds being green and soft pc top.
but rocky underneath.
Newtown’s form against Glebe at Sydney
Cricket Ground on Saturday suggests that they will
be dangerous contenders for the Rugby League pre-
miership this season. They scored 20 points (4 tries
4 goals) to 6 (2 tries). Newtown’s ruck men pre-
dominated from the kick-off, Knight beating Haddock
with monotonous frequency, and despite the treacher-
ous turf and the greasy ball their backs were always
aggressive. The best man on the grass was J. Day,
the Newtown custodian, formerly of Christian
Brothers’, Goulburn. It Was his first game in the
Metropolis, and he did everything that was asked
of him —handled well, tackled grimly and hoisted
four grand goals. G. Gaudry, the winger, justified
his promotion from the reserves, and others who
helped were Bains, Ryan and Clamback —returned
from Eastern Suburbs. Gray, Benson and McGrath
battled valiantly for Glebe, but they felt Burge’s loss
keenly. Lacking that great player the side went to
pieces when combined work was called for. The
only surprise of the afternoon was administered by
Western Suburbs to' North Sydney, hist year’s pre-
miers just scraping home by 17 points to 16. Two
innovations are the padding of goal posts and the
posting of half-time scores of other matches in
plain English. Last year, to increase the sale of
threepenny programmes, the League gave the infor-
mation in code. A very frugal body is the League.

This is a counterfeit presentment of H. R.
Miller, secretary of
the N.S.W. Rugby
League and one of the
founders of its for-
tunes. He was assistant
sec. in 1908, when it
burst into existence,
treasurer in 1909, and
see. in 1914, succeed-
ing the late E. Larkin,
M.L.A. A product of
Sydney Uni. Miller
was a fine threequarter
back in his day, and
a really first-class
sprinter. One of his
track feats was to
dead-heat with Nigel
Barker, then at the
top of his form.

“Leagueite”:
“Tedda” Courtney, the
Western Suburbs
(N.S.W.) forward, is
entering upon his 18th
year of first-grade foot-
ball. With his fam-
ous diving tackle he
has bumped and
grassed English,
Maori and Banana-
land representatives.
He went to England
with Jim Giltinan’s
1908 Kangaroos, and
also accompanied the
1911-12 team. The most remarkable thing about
Courteny is that he never trains.
“Centurion”: Although “J.H.” is on the
spot (B. 26/4/’23), I decline to admit I was wrong
in my remarks about Lawton’s suspension, a hap-
pening' that I forecasted in The Bulletin before Law-
ton left Australia. It was always stated then that
Lawton’s offence was purely technical, but, hitherto
at least, the English R.U.V. acted on the very letter
of the anti-professional laws. 1 met the Queenslander
at the Sydney Union rooms on the morning of his
sailing for Europe, and found him fully alive to the
possibilities. Lawton left accredited to Lei) Brown,
ex-Queensland rep. and Oxford and England captain,
as well as Australia’s representative on the Rugby
Union Council. It is marvellous, under the circum-
stances, that Oxford Rugger authorities lived in a
fool’s paradise. As to Lawton’s popularity at Oxford
and his certainty of an England “cap,” “J.H.” is
only- recapitulating forecasts made in these columns
ijionths ago.
* * * *
H. Tailored, famous Rugby Union for-
ward of other days, who went over to the League in
M.L., and was readmitted by the amateurs, has now
been disqualified for life by the M.L. League. His
services had been desired by the Balmain (N.S.W.)
League club. Sydney Sun added to the humor of
the situation by declaring that the N.S.W. Rugby
League, which gravely endorsed the disqualification,
refused to admit persons ruled out by the R.U.,
Soccer or Australian organisations. Considering that
nine-tenths of the League’s officials and prominent
players are ex-Rugby Unionites, disqualified by the
senior body for taking- up the professional game, this
last jest caps the lot. The matter will go down to his-
tory as the first instance of a professional being dis-
qualified for turning amateur.
“Fax”: George Giffen, good Australian and
great cricketer in his day, seems quite happv in
having stuck to his little billet in the Adelaide
G.P.O. Yet, he might have made a good few
thousands as the imported star of an English county
team, or a Marylebone Club professional, with the
proceeds of big benefit matches to swell his savings,
and a comfortable position as coach waiting his
retirement from the Eleven. Old cricketers used to
wonder why George didn’t take his all-round talent
to the best market, and let an artless lion-huntress
capture him as Spofforth did. But he chose to
stop in Australia and remain unmarried.
FISHIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Vou can. have your booze and jazz or your races and
your bettin’;
Why shouldn’t you, if you want to ? But for me
1 like the quiet of a boat just when the sun is
settin’
And a little breeze like music stirs the sea.
The nicest gamble ever an’ the safest is just fishin’
When the sport is fair to middlin ’and you have
your peace o’ mind;
When the prawns are not too noisy 1 am never
bitter wishin’
For wealth an’ power or other toys o’ silly human,
kind.
When the prawns are not too musty and the bream
are runnin’ steady and the reddenin’ sunset
whispers to the lazy, lispin’ sea,
.Not an emperor or a lady chased by dukes an’ coves
with diamonds has anything to speak of on
a simple cove like me I
There’s a comfortable feeling in the heave o’ water
movin’
In the wavelets that seem just about asleep,
The heave as soft as satin that is somehow always
provin’
The mighty power behind it of the deep.
And the bream that snoops my bait up is the saucy
little brother
O’ leviathan that Job talked of, an’ sharks and
rollin’ whales;
And even the little breeze that lisps is, after all,
no other
Than the force that shakes creation in the grip o’
winter gales.
When I’m lonely where the crowds are and light
chatter makes me dilly, there’s one companion-
ship that never fails;
It’s when I’m sittin’ fishin’ while the sunset burns to
purple and the breezes tell me yarns about
the gales.
Vou may have your painted women and your wines
an’ costly dishes (if you like ’em it’s your
funeral), but for me
Give me fifty yards o’ silk to tickle up the greedy
fishes, while I listen to the music of the sea!

“Pat Bushie” : The old lady and her guests
bad discussed the latest murder, divorce and
suicide, and all other things affecting

W. E. Acraman, of an old Adelaide family,
just dead at 55. was known long ago in the
Commercial Bank in Broken Hill and vari-
ous parts of Vic. Then he got in early at
Coolgardie as a carrier with camel teams.
For years past, however, he had been with
the South Aus. wine-making firm of Seppelt
and Sons. His wife was a Hunter, of the
Bendigo brewing family.
“Palatine”: “The Deacon” (B. 19/4/’23).
illustrating the rapacity of some surgeons,
mentions that, whereas one man wanted £63
for removing polypi, another “cut out the
four in five minutes,” and after pocketing a
guinea or two sent the patient home. If one
was a shark I suspect it was the second man.
Any indifferent nose-carpenter could in a
few moments snip off a few offending polypi,
and would probably thereby provide himself
with a permanent job, as these unwelcome
tags arise in most cases from a deep-seated
area of inflammation, for treating which the
first-quoted fee would have been reasonable
if properly done. Snipped off, they recur as
regularly as the tax-collector.
“Perspective”: “Henry Horsecollar,” on
Canberra (B. 12/4/’23), has forked over
one of the most offensive stinks emanat-
ing from architectural competitions in
Australia. Burley Griffin, whom I have
never seen, won the Canberra competi-
tion against the w’orld. It was the
cleanest and finest architectural victory
I remember, and, as a competition, was
a credit to us. Then the architect wire-
pullers and politicians got to work, downed
the author of the design by hobbling him
with offensive and impossible conditions, stole
the guts of his magnificent scheme, and are
now in process of rehashing it. Every archi-
tect in Australia —I among them —would
have given all his back teeth, also shirt and
socks, to win the competition. But our
ability wasn’t up to it. When we lost, almost
the whole profession jumped on the man who
had beaten us, and promptly “put in the boot”
—and the public seems to be following suit.
“T.R.H.” : The total receipts for the past
season at Monte Carlo amounted to £876,000,
and the profits, which go into the bulging
pockets of the Prince of Monaco, were
£189,000. This non-gambler, who waxes fat on
the folly of others, was in London at the
coronation of George V.—not as a Royal
guest, of course, but as a mere sightseer.
He had a ticket for the stand near the
Abbey, but had delayed his arrival so long
that he couldn’t get near his 10-guinea seat.
I was the sympathetic listener to whom he
poured out his troubles. He is a jolly little
man with a strong French accent, and he
had very little faith in the permanency of
the entente even in those days. There is one
subject on which it is impossible to get him
to talk, and that is the death-rate at Monte
Carlo. However, anyone going broke at the
tables can always “borrow” his or her fare
home, but if suicide is “the only way,” as
Martin Harvey would say, the departing
guest is sure of a decent funeral at the
Prince’s expense.
“X2X” arraigns the mosquito ’afresh: —
Some recent experiments by Australian scientists
place the ordinary mosquito (Stcgomyia fasciato)
under strong suspicion of being a carrier, or means
of infection, of syphilis and typhoid fever, besides
the diseases which he is positively known to convey.
The mode of infection is, of course, different, but
the result may be the same. Where malarial fever
is concerned the causatory organism of the disease
has an important part of its life-cycle situated In
the insect, without the aid of which it could not be
transferred from one person to another. Syphilis,
on the other hand, may be transferred by an insect,
in the same way as it is transferred through some
article previously handled by an infected person.
Some years ago, in one of our capitals, the origin
of a syphilitic sore on the face of a patient was
traced to the latter having been accidentally struck
by the lash of a whip which a cabman had bec-n
in the habit of chewing in a badly infected mouth.
The lash itself was only in contact with the victim
for a fraction of a second, yet the mischief was
worked. How much easier for a mosquito whose
proboscis has been plunged for several minutes into
the tissues of an infected person to convey the dis-
ease to a healthy one !
“Macquarie Street”: The celerity with
which the Customs Department modified the
ban on the importation of “The Decameron”
proved that the official wheels can put on a
spurt; the whole laughable affair occupied
only a few days. Some time ago the Customs
burnt all the privately-addressed copies of
La Vie Farisienne on the ground that the
sheet., which was a hot favorite with the
Diggers in the trenches, was a menace to
decency ; but that action was a bagatelle com-
pared with the offence of tabooing Boccaccio’s
masterpiece. I wonder who the under-
strapper was who ran foul of one of the
greatest classics in the history of literature
—a work which, besides delighting thousands
of readers, inspired some of the most illus-
trious writers, including La Fontaine? That
famous author, who borrowed freely from
.Esop, Machiavelli, Ariosto and Rabelais,
confessed that the tales of Boccaccio pleased
him most, and lie wrote to Mademoiselle de
Sillery that he had entirely forsaken .Esop
for Boccaccio. But I don’t know why the
public delights in buying three-guinea illus-
trated English versions of the tales when
it can get them in the original for a few
lire. The'illustrations are, as a rule, worth-
less, the translation is slovenly, and Italian
has to be introduced where it would be
inadvisable for the English tongue to ven-
ture. It is as well worth learning Italian
merely to read “The Decameron” as it is to
learn Spanish to read “Don Quixote.” In-
cidentally. I have been amazed during “The
Decameron” breeze at the ignorance of our
young people about foreign authors. I met
a schoolmistress yesterday who had never
heard of “Decameron” or Boccaccio, either.
Last week I met a lady employed in a big
bank who had never heard of Zola. Surely
there is something amiss with our educa-
tion system.

The return of Moiseiwitsch to Sydney
Town Hall was in the nature of a triumph.
The building was crowded even to the organ-
lofts ; and after the opening Bach num-
ber (Fantasia and Fugue in D Minor) a
thrill of silence for a moment held the house
—after that came the hailstorm of applause.
This young man takes everything at breath-
less pace, yet retains a velvet touch, a rip-
pling movement and that other unclassified
quantity called variously temperament, soul
or poetry. It was particularly appreciable
in the Beethoven Sonato ( Appassionata). Of
this he has made a memorial to beauty, h ol-
lowed a group of Chopin, and the highly-
colored and sound-full Ravel Toccata. De-
hussy, Stravinsky, Scriabine and Liszt figured
on the tremendous one-man programme; and
this paper can’t help wondering when we
will become civilised enough to expect a
musical artist to play only one or two works
in an evening. The artist with the brush
paints one picture, for which he is paid hun-
dreds of guineas; but for half-a-guinea we
expect an evening gorged with sound—much
more than even the musical mind can digest.
❖ *l* v
“The Cat and the Canary” opened for a
Sydney Criterion audience on Saturday the
old box of tricks that go to make up the
Shudder play. There were sliding panels,
gloved hands that darted around doorways,
a hollow bookcase into which a respectable
family lawyer was dragged in the first act,
only to pitch forward from another bit of
hollow panelling in a different part of the
old house, a very dead man, at the end of
the second act. The play revolves around
the will of an eccentric which has to be read
20 years after his death, at midnight, in the
house in which he died. The money goes to
one Annabelle West (Muriel Martin Har-
vey), a nice-looking slip of a thing, on condi-
tion that she develops no strain of the in-
sanity that lurks in the family. If the girl
becomes queer or dies, the estate, lock, stock
and barrel, goes to another lieir whose name
is in a sealed envelope in the pocket of the
afterwards-abducted family lawyer. The
plot, after the reading of the will, mostly
revolves around Annabelle and all sorts of
diabolical schemes to send her off her head.
There’s a homicidal maniac dragged in to
kind-of-put an extra glow into the evening;
and a West Indian serving-maid (Eily Mal-
yon), who seems to have a wide circle of
acquaintances in th£ Shadow World. Of the
three young men who might have been heirs,
and who all are seeking the hand of the
heiress, one (Paul Jones) turns unexpected y
into a hero, another into quite a nice chap,
and the last, Charles Wilder (Anew McMas-
ter), resolves into a gibbering idiot, just
before Paul Jones (Garry Marsh) claims the
final close-up from the heiress whom nothing
can send mad.
* * * _*
The play is full of mechanical devices and
blind alleys of suspicion. It is hysterical
to the last degree;
“Bulldog Drummond

it plays overmuch
on the ugly theme
of insanity. It is
an unhealthy titil-
lating of the imagi-
nation, and should
be forbidden to

As Annabelle West
Muriel Martin-
Harvey showed
just the right shade
of terror; and the
piece of business in
the last act, where
she flutters, and
beats her hands,
and shrinks into
the corner of the
sofa, as if she were
the canary in the
cage stalked by the
cat, was very
clever. Equal honors
must go to Eily
Malyon as “Mam-
my Plea s a n t.”
Mayne Lynton and
Anew McMaster
dashed around suc-
cessfully to make
the evening un-
pleasant ; and the
remainder of the company worked well in a
bad cause.
Australia having been good to them, and
things theatrical in London being about as
bad as they can be, Lee TV hite and Clay
Smith have decided to stay here for a season
and run their own revue co. Sydney 1 aiace
is the scene of the interesting experiment,
and the company won’t fail on the score ot
energy, for its members are all triers,
White herself works like three women to
persuade the audience that the show is wortn
the money, and simple as are the ditties
she warbles in that husky, tricky voice ot
hers the effect is uncommonly agreeable.
The’smiling dame’s way of announcing in
song that she has gaht a servant and that
Flahssie has found her fust grey hair is a
liberal education in the treatment of vocal
commonplace. One accepts with satisfacti
the unimportant intelligence. Clay temitn,
liberating himself from the producers job,
plays his wife’s accompaniments during a
pleasant quarter-hour, and uplifts a service-
able baritone in syncopated duets, tlectoi.
St. Clair scores heavily in several sketches,
notably a burlesque of a Greek play, an
has a capable coadjutor in Graham Don-
caster. Mae Baird reappears m several
brisk dances, and Archie Thompson, who
looks as if he could fight lightweight, whirls
the buxom young woman about in a mannei
that is marvellous to behold. Miss Band
trained the ballerinas, who have a playim
habit of footing it along a platform jutting
out from the stage. In deference to the
Christadelpbian Conference they conceal
their shapely limbs in rompers and baby
socks. By way of showing what winsome
young Australians can do when the oppor-
tunity comes, one of them stepped out. ot
the ranks oir Saturday night and brought the

stuff. Her name is Billie Lockwood, and
she will be heard of again.
The bones of legions of melodramatic
skeletons rattle in “The Squatter’s Daugh-
ter,” presented by Bert Bailey and Jules
Grant at Sydney Grand Opera House.
Ostentatiously an out-back drama, there is
still much to recall the novelettes of a decade
ago. Familiar stunts are the baby-substitut-
ing act (done before the show' starts), the
planting of an incriminating note in the
hero’s pocket and the subsequent removal ot
the note by the faithful abo., who had observed
the dark deed; the kidnapping of the hero
and his rescue by the heroine, and vice versa,
and the discovery that the photo in the
locket that the hero carries is his own mother
and the dead wife of the squatter. Bush-
ranger Ben Hall is introduced shouting, oaths
through a well-trimmed beard, and supported
by a band of cut-throats who regard crime
with reprehensible levity. Virtue, however,
triumphs at 10.45 p.m. punctually. Austen
Milroy wears the halo; Rutland Beckett col-
lects the hoots, and Bert Bailey the loud
laughs. Vera Remee makes a jolly and
vigorous heroine, Jenny Thorton is an admir-
able flapper, and Rita Astin fits in as the
chaperon. The remaining cast —bushrangers,
abos., station-hands and troopers—are re-
corded in oases of programme amidst an
awful desert of advertisement. The scenery
is worth seeing, and a sheep-shearing and
whip-cracking interlude give the play a local
touch.
Admiration of Julius Knight runs riot at
Sydney Tivoli, where he is now the sray hero
of Anthony Hope’s best-seller, “The Pri-
soner of Zenda.” The turn being limited, he
can only serve up the prologue —which is as
satisfying as reading the middle of a well-
thumbed serial in a dentist’s waiting-room.
However, Julius works wonders with the
little he does, and still makes the Young
Thing’s heart flutter. The same audience
also sits up and takes notice of the melody
manufacture of the Two Vagabonds.
“Smilin’ Through,” which got a'kind and
patient hearing at Melbourne Royal last
(Saturday, belongs to the spook penod of
American drama, and carries the audience
back to the distant past after treatin» ot a
spiritualistic future and a commonplace pre-
sent. It is “pretty” to a fault, and senti-
mentally saccharine. Its thin, wire-drawn
plot, involving the perpetual bickeiing and
reconciliation of two old men (who have no
apparent interest in hfe save Kathleen and
Kenneth) would be insufferably dull but for
the change of costume-fashions and the. 'urid
murder in the vision scene. Even as it is, the
spiritualistic convictions of the story may make
more foes than friends for the entertainment.
• * * #
William Mollison, as the old John Car-
teret of the present and the young John of
the vision, is very successful owing to the
natural of his low notes in conver-
sation and his go-slow deportment. Aubrey
Mather, as an ancient crony who plays
dominoes; (how the American dramatists do
love combinations of dear old men!),
is not too stodgy in the brief vision scene,
and it is here also that Cromn-M llson gets
in his best work. In the youthful part of
Kenneth Wavne he is heavy, not to say dull
but as Jeremiah Wayne, of 1864, his drun-
ken stupidity and violence are capital acting.
Miss Waldegrave is useful as an old and
voung domestic servant, one of those stereo-
typed stage domestics who remain unmarried
in the same billet till death does them part;
and Miss Gertrude Elliott is—Just Sweet.
As Kathleen and Moonyeen, and Moonyeen s
immortal spirit hanging around the same
premises for 55 years with nothing better
to do after death than watch the world grow
older, Miss Elliott is invariably Just Sweet,
Her Irish accent’s resemblance to Allen
Doone’s is very noticeable, and her lack Oi.
power is equally apparent when she meets
her stagey death at the mouth of Jeremiahs
gun, or comes smilin’ through the garden
doorway wearing the wedding garb she died in.

The hardest thing one can say of the Aus-
tralian comedy “The Whirlpool,” produced
at Melbourne Playhouse by the Mermaid Go.
last week, is that the story and character-
isation are English rather than
Australian. A crudely conven-
tional outline of plot doesn t,
however, prevent Mary Wilkin-
son’s comedy of contrasted types
from being interesting. The neat
dialogue has snap in it, also a
distinctive femininity in its
more audacious moods, as when
an alleged centenarian lady talks
of the good old days when her
now aged admirer dared to stick
a pin into somebody’s “behind,”
and a female friend of her youth
wore red flannel drawers. There
is something truly spinsterxan
about sucli recklessly giddy dialogue.
On the other hand the authoress wins ones
respect and gratitude for such epigrams as
that of the dour, wowser father, who pro-
tested against Isabel Handley’s introduction
of an artistic photogravure into the family,
on the ground that everybody knew what
art was—nothing but “an excuse. Dulcie
Bland shared chief honors with Miss Hand-
ley, and everybody did well enough.
Nearly everyone in the revival of “The
Arcadians,” at Melbourne Majesty’s, seems a
little short of the necessary equipment.
Leslie Holland gives a fair performance as
Peter Doody, but his only original contribu-
tion is a divertingly spectral countenance.
Otherwise he repeats Tom Walls histone
caricature of the jock, steadfastly eftacing
his own personality, until one feels he is
being played by the character. But there
is no lack of Dan Agar in the impersonation
of Simplicitas. A fussy, bubbly little man,
with vast self-confidence and a devastating
load of musty knockabout business, Agar
suggests that he is carrying a movie comedi-
an’s slapstick in his knapsack. But he is
bright in sundry conventional particulars.
Kathlyn Hilliard is stodgy in the part of
Sombra, and her well-built soprano has no
enthralling music in it. Clarice Hardwicke
is mostly lost to view as Chrysea, but she
speaks her few lines becomingly ; and John
L Forde, as Father Time, looks every minute
of his antiquity. Claude Flemming por-
trays Sir George Paddock as a portentous
actor of the type who appears half-dressed
without a fur-collared overcoat and an im-
mense cigar. Reginald Purdell isn t per-
turbing as Bobby, nor is Robert Chisholm en-
titled to the bouquet which this writer is
determined to throw at someone before this
paragraph ends. Chisholm is a big fellow
with a decent voice, but, until he can d vert
to his job some of the attention which he now
bestows on the audience he will never get
on The Bulletin’s Roll of Honor. After
due consideration the posy aforesaid is handed
to Nellie Payne for her daintiness and pret-
tiness as Eileen Kavanasdi, thouch her voice
is only an appealing little twitter for such
an item as “Buy Me a Rose.” Emmeline
Orford is an exuberant Mrs. Smith, and
Harry Hilliard continues to exploit the
“■argle of vacuous merriment which was his
principal donation to the “Southern Maid.
At Melbourne Tivoli the turn of the Pall
Malls, a remarkable male somersault dancer
and his lady abettor in comedy and whirl,
makes the Eight Akabah Arabs look preten-
tiously unnecessary. Audrey Knight is a
humorous little woman, and the quaint absur-
dity of Gus McNaughton’s fooling in “Kleau-
ers, Ltd.,” has competent support.
“BACK AGAIN,”
AT SYDNEY
PALACE.
Lee White as a school marm with a couple of
queer scholars.
“The Silver Fox',” at Melbourne King’s,
continues to present Lawrence Grossmith as
a novelist of unnatural placidity, surrounded
by highly improbable human circumstances
of both sexes, and engaged in a comedy which
changes its character every few minutes.
Hugh Ward’s management emphasises the
announcement of the Last Glorious Weeks
of “The O’Brien Girl,” at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, by stating that “Tangerine” is being
prepared for action. Meanwhile, there are
Boat-race Nights and a good few nights
to follow ere the present show is dragged
from where it took root last Christmas.

“Bulldog Drummond,” at Melbourne
ihilace, is another hardy plant. The fact
that Mulcaster chokes a mad doctor has en-
deared him to a public that likes a good murder.

Gerardy’s persuasive ’cello will make music
at Melbourne Town Hall this week and next,

In a frivolous moment The Bulletin
suggested poisoned peanuts as a reward tor
one recent turn of “The Three Scamps, at
Melbourne Tivoli. The Scamps don t want
poisoned peanuts, and The Bulletin won
insist. It didn’t like the turn and isn t go-
ing to say it did ; but as The Scamps have
been together for eight years,. and have en-
joyed considerable popularity in three conti-
nents, there is abundant evidence that thej
can give good turns, and The Bu llei u
cheerfully admits it. Also, it is sorry if the
suggestion of the peanuts hurt the gentlemen.

Oscar Asche dominates in every way the
great spectacle, “Cairo,” at Adelaide Royal,
sheer melodrama in a sumptuous . Eastern
setting. The show leaves this quiet city some-
what dazed at the finish, and . needs seeing
at least twice. The other chief honors in
acting go to women, Gladys Mason as tne
revengeful young widow and Jessie Page as
an unconventional Chinese woman; though
Mason Wood scores heavily as a quite con-
ventional Chinaman. Business is
Varietv at Majestic and Prince of Wales is
much as before. Daisy Jerome is quite her
old self, and most of her songs are familiar
friends; in fact, the public seems to like the
old ones best.

A Melbourne monologue show: —
Renewing acquaintance with the work of C. Hampel
at the Athenaeum one finds his still-life painting
growing a little smug and effusive. The wealth
of carnations crushed into the black bowl in i o. >
is significant of the new trend, which approaches
potboiler-making in “A Bowl of Roses C*o-
- in the outburst of ranunculus (No 4). Contra*,,
the flamboyancy of those efforts with the earlie
simple style of “White Rose Study,’’ which some
good judge has acquired for seven guineas, and you
have all the difference between a Chopin Nocturne
and four ukulele orchestras playing at once. In
landscape, however, Hampel’s performance is full or
merit. One must commend him for the unconven
tional veracity of his “Moonlight on the Derwent,
though the scene hardly warrants such a spread o.
canvas. But his strongest achievement is his Sep-
tember Morning.” Not over-striking in a pictoria
way, it is still a record of faithful observation aim
sensitive appreciation of light and atmosphere.

“Private Boxer”: There is a chance for
the whisky distillers in the titles of Sydney
Telegraph’s two prize plays. What price a
new- brand being advertised thus: “The
Spirit of Desire—The ‘Lap’ of the Gods”!
“Digger Stror-at”: Harry Corson Clarke
is dead in California. The Americans used
to regard him as the best light-comedy actor
of his day, but he wasn’t exactly that when
he came to Australia with Niblo in 1913. His
wife, Margaret Dale Owen, was present when
the curtain fell.
“Orb”: The mummer who interests me
most in “If Winter Comes,” at Sydney
Royal, is Frank Hareourt, who swears in
the witnesses at the coroner’s court. Under
his snow-white thatch the old man must have
memories of a thousand character parts. For
many years he w r as a very Proteus in George
Rignold’s company, and that Big Chief swore
by him. In “Henry V.” Frank played as
many as eight parts in the one show. Parts,
mind you, for his little lot included Bar-
dolpb, the French soldier w T ho knuckles
under to Pistol,pCaptain Macmorris, and the
Lord knows what ambassadors, heralds, lords
and archbishops besides. Speaking French
fluently, Frank always had to instruct
Katherine and Alice, and, having had experi-
ence as a vocalist —lie has done vaudeville
singing turns —his mellow voice helped out
every catch and chorus in Rignold’s shows.
“If Winter Coines” finds him still in har-
ness; but the Firm’s pay envelope is always
waiting for the veteran whether he plays or
not.
“Bert X. Dig”: I don’t know whe' 1 r
George Robey is Court Jester. And Id. i
care. But those Diggers who were in Huie-
field .Park Hospital are his debtors for many
a bright hour. He generally brought a
company along, but when the other mum-
mers failed him George made the trip him-
self and gave us a one-man show. Also, he
invariably left a fiver for the sports and
cigarette funds. Strange to say, I never
sighted his “Bing Boys on Broadway” part-
ner, Violet Lotaine, on any of his welcome
visits, although Australia wasn’t bad to her.
“0.K.”: The late Fred Cambourne was
never a more “fashionable” actor in Aus-
tralia than in his young and frivolous days.
Thirty-five years ago he had
a nice little show with the
first Gaiety Burlesque Co.,
which included Nellie Far-
ren, Fred Leslie, Marion
Ilood, Letty Lind and Sylvi
Grey, Fanny MarrioG,
Charles Danby and Fred
Storey. Cambourne was
then billed as F. “Cam-
bours” (there were two
other Freds in the co., any-
how) and in “Monte Cristo,
Jun.” he figured as Cader-
ousse, tailor and toper. It
was ever his pride that in
his one good scene he had
the house in laughter while
Leslie and Farren stood
aside and chafed over their
momentary unimport-
ance, Next year Cambourne
played the obsequious Eng-
lish groom to “Little Lord
Fauntleroy,” and looked the
character to the life. This
was the first production of
the comedy in Australia, the
old Earl being well acted by
Harr y Edwardes from
America, with whom two
clever youngsters —Olive
Berkeley and Grade Hop-
kins-alternated in the
name-part. The cut of Cam-
bourne, and that bold nose
of his, suggested that he
ought to have done good
work as a. Shakspearean
clown, but he seemed to get
stuck in a rut of stodgy
parts in drama. One re-
members him, though, as act-
ing in the farcical comedies
that Harry Paulton pro-
duced six-and-twenty years
ago; as one of the kirk
elders in “The Little Min-
ister,” when Pattie Browne
brought it to Australia ; and
as ,Cassim Baba in a J.C.W.
panto. In his time Fred
Cainbourne played many
£>arts and saved many pence. Strict economy
was i.is motto off the stage.
“Minnetrsiia”: One more addition to the
37 houses in which “Maritana” emerged from
the void. When The Rangers, Mosman
(N.S.W.), was being demolished a few years
ago, a newspaper history of Colonel Blox-
holme’s old home described how “Wallace
sat under the pine-trees on the estate” and
brought forth his opera, or the music
thereof.
“H.K.”: Veteran John Gordon was un-
questionably one of the forerunners of the
moving-picture business in Australia (B.
26/4/’23), but there were others. As far
back as May, 1848, Bull's Life published
this ad.: —
Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney. Beautiful
Scientific Exhibition of Dissolving Views and newly-
discovered Optical Instrument, The Chromatrope,
shown by the aid of the Drummond Light. Ten
thousand square feet of illuminated scenery, includ-
ing (1) Ponti Rotti, Rome, (2) Hammersmith Sus-
pension Bridge, (3) Colonnade, Venice, (4) Sligo
Cathedral, Ireland.
In the absence of proof to the contrary, I
claim that to have been the first display of
a sort-of-a-kind of motion-pictures on this
continent.
“Pitt Streeter”: In Sydney theatrical
circles the question of the moment is “What
Happened to Mary?” “Mary” is the name
of the musical comedy which was produced
in Melbourne six months ago, and has been
touring all over Australia and M.L. since.
It was to have been put up for Maud Fane’s
farewell to Pitt-streefc : and the immediate
vicinity, but the Firm suddenly made other
arrangements. So Maud, like Dot Brunton,
will say goodbye in “Oh, Lady, Lady !”
“Fax”: The return of Gerardy reminds
one of the late Van Biene. for a quarter
of a century made a good income in Britain
by introducing his 'cello into his poor melo-
drama, “The Broken Melody,” and could
always command an audience for his occa-
sional recital at the Queen’s Hall, London.
It chanced that when Van Biene was rush-
ing his melodrama through Australia,. an-
other 'cellist was imported by J.C.W. in a
concert co., and a Melbourne pressman asked
the Anglicised Dutch Jew what he thought
of the other fellow. “Ah,” said Van Biene,
“if I had his left hand and he had a little
of my fried-fish feeling—-my ‘grease’—we
would both be great artists.” No self-decep-
tion, no cant about “soul,” in that man of
business.
“To Po”: W’hen Williamson, Garner and
Musgrove w’ere producing pantomimes in
the 'eighties some of the boys in my class
earned holiday silver by acting as monkeys,
hind legs of elephants and the like. I was
their confidant on the Monday after the
Saturday rehearsal. Said one aspiring
artist: “My word, J.C. was wet witu our
boss Satterdee. ‘Wot’s them kids doin’ there ?
’e sez. ‘They’s monkeys, sir,’ sez the boss. I
ain’t "taught ’em their business yet.’ ‘Busi-
ness!’ says J.C. ‘Hey, yous, go out to
the Zoo and learn yer own business.
My nipper went, and absorbed the. great
THE UP-TO-DATE PIRATE.
THE LADY : “Well, you're a nice sort of a pirate to let
another fellow run off with your girl. I thought
your motto was ‘Once aboard the lugger and the
girl is mine’ ?”
THE PIRATE: “Yes; but the other chap had a motor-car.”
truth that monkeys spend most of their time
looking for fleas. On J.C.’s next visit he
gave a life-like display. “Got a rise of five
bob a week.” was the subsequent report.
I went to the first night. My monkey
turned a somersault, hunted for vermm and
gibbered and spluttered so realistically that
when he scampered off he got a round of
applause to himself. In the wings William-
son patted him on the head, sayiug, “A fine
little actor, and another rise of five shil-
lings !” I often wonder what became of him.
On the movies, no doubt.
“Fax”: A fetv Melbourne playgoers in-
cline to the owlish suggestion that “The
Silver Fox” is intended for a satire on
matrimonial things that are, whereas Cosmo
Hamilton is merely going one better than he
went in “Scandal.” In that play a girl of
unimpeachable “purity” declares herself mar-
ried to a certain man in order to excuse her
presence in another man’s rooms. In “The
Silver Shocks” an uncorrupted married
woman declares herself an adulteress with
one bachelor in order that her husband may
set her free to marry another. No satire
about it. .lust audacious imposition on
common public sense.
“Hamfat”: Percy Walshe (B. 3/5/’23) is
not kicking against the cruel misfortune —
an affection of the voice—Which has perma-
nently unfitted him for important parts. He
stiffs mums, in a small way, and his know-
ledge of stagecraft would make him worth
his money to any management. Which re-
mark is also true of Charlie Kenhingham,
who could act as well as sing, and was as
finely competent as the Jester in “Twelfth
Night” as he was as Ralph Rackstraw in
“Pinafore.” Charlie is in business in Syd-
ney, deafness having wrecked his chances of
ever appearing again on the stage. Theatri-
cal life is full of these tragedies.
“E.T.”: “The Edge of Beyond” was not
Ethel M. Dell’s atrocity (“J.H.,” B.
26/4/’23), but Gertrude Page’s. Ethel Avas
responsible for two pieces recently produced
on London stages, adaptations of her “Knave
of Diamonds” and “The Way of an Eagle.”
The latter put up a respectable run of 150
performances.
“Old Broughite”: Memories of two old
curtains were brought back to me by the
reproduction in a Sydney Sunday paper of
T. A. Gilfillan’s painting, “The Landing of
Captain Cook.” One was the old drop curtain
of the Criterion, showing, in the foreground,
a bunch of Binghis offering Cook a de-
canter and glasses (near Cook was a sailor
with his hat in his hand), and in the back-
ground another lot of niggers going for their
lives. I forget whether the painter was
Spong, Brnnton, Clint or Gordon. The
other was at His (then Her) Majesty’s, and
exhibited the artist’s idea of Windsor Castle.
What has become of those old curtains? In
another country they would be preserved in
a theatrical museum.
“T.P.”: In my dead and wished-for Mel-
bourne years I saw a dainty morceau,
“Sithors to Grind.” George Leitch wrote
it and played lead in what to my youthful
fancy, was a jewel in words, a delightful
idyll. Now comes a sceptic who harshly
asserts that there never was such a play;
and that Leitch, a mere low-comedian with
Snazelle, was incapable of writing a poem
with a stage sett.ng. I have spent hours
looking up old papers in the hope of confut-
ing him. I don’t know the theatre; I canh
recall the year. Will “The Oldest Inhabi-
tant” or some other long-memoried ancient
help?
“Toter”: E. J. Tait saw a higher-toned
thriller in Noo Yark than the one in
Nebraska (B. l/3/’23), where the heroine
brought down the house by stigmatising the
vill.vun aS a blankard. A choice bit of dia-
logue in the N.Y. chef d’oeuvre began in this
intriguing fashion (with myself as Bowdler) :
Gent, (to lady): “You are a tart, and keep a
tartshop.”
Lady: “You dirty natural child!
The gent, counters with a pleasantry popular
among sturdy democrats with put-in-the-boot
proclivities, and the lady silences him with
a term of endearment affected by the most
exclusive -garrotters in Surry Hills. “This
abomination,” writes Tait, “is pulling in
5000 dollars a performance —say, £BOOO a
week. They wanted me to buy it for Aus-
tralia, but i was afraid it wouldn’t suit.”
“Lud”: Lawrence Grossmith’s brother
George, after many years of jigging about
in song-and-dance pieces, confesses that he
is getting a bit too old for the game. He
is, therefore, going in for “straight” comedy,
and makes a start in yet another Pinero re-
vival, “The Gay Lord Quex.” Grossmitli
has cast himself for the giddy old bird who
gives his title to the piece. It was in “Quex’
that Irene Vanburgh jumped into stardom
by her performance of Sophie Fullgarney.
“Gaza” : The two flappers were more in-
tent on letting the surrounding stallholders
know that they’d read the book than on en-
joying its stage version. The hero was flour-
ishing an automatic when “Oh, he didn’t
carry a revolver in the hook!” was the ump-
teenth twinge given to the neighboring suf-
ferers. “No!" hissed a victim in the next
row of seats, “but in a theatre I always
do.” Quietness.
“Bison” : An actor-r strolled into a small-
goods emporium well known to the profesh,
and to the rather aggressive vestal behind the
counter delivered an order for a parcel of
sandwiches. Asked to particularise, he ex-
pressed a desire for “beef with a dab of mus-
tard,” and the lady turned her back to cut
up the provender on the ledge behind. Pre-
sently she banged down a dozen suspiciously
thin "slices, and when she hurried away to
get some -paper to wrap them in the mum-
mer turned up the first sheet of bread, only
to discover a small dot of fat in place of
the expected meat. Ruefully he parted a
heavy price for the snack, but he had his
INEXPERIENCED.
FIRST ACTOR : “Do you think it is cheaper
to move or pay rent?”
SECCND DITTO : “I can't tell you, my dear
boy. I have always moved."
small revenge at the door. Pausing for a
moment, he said mildly: “You don’t keep
horses, I suppose.” “No,” answered the
lady, “what makes you ask?” “Oh, nothing,
he returned. “I was only thinking^the
Kellys used to keep horses. Good night.”
ON TOUR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With Howie’s All Star Dramatic Co.
We battled through the niulga zone ;
The drought, the worst the West had known,
Played Sheol with our crippled show;
We stormed to empty seats in vain,
And with the eoekies prayed for rain.
Our public mostly kept away;
Its apathy Art couldn’t move.
The few who came did not approve
The sloppy nature of our play;
It seemed to aggravate the gloom
When we essayed “The Drunkard’s Doom.’’
Howie played the lead with all his might—
That’s not the word, he didn’t -play;
He qualified so well all day
He was the Drunkard every night.
On him the drought had done its worst;
He owned a most Gargantuan thirst.
And so we struggled further out,
And ever went from bad to worse.
The public still remained perverse ;
Each aching town was sick with drought.
Our prospects were as midnight black,
Yet we’d no funds to take us back.
Yam’s two-quid house was an event —
We did “The Lunatic at Large”—
And then the, miscreant in charge
Demanded thirty bob for rent!
He hinted, as that sum he claimed,
The play was appositely named.
At Bungledoo “The Bedroom Sin”
Attracted fifteen shillings, cash.
At Sudden Jerk we did our dash —
One patron paid to see “East Lynne.”
He was our landlord —how he railed,
And swore he’d see us duly gaoled!
W T e got a lift to Dynamite,
And there again our luck was crossed—
Despite the heat we were a frost,
For nobody turned up at night
Except the bailiff, who’d the gall
To lock our boxes in the hall.
We got to Gammon Flat at length ;
We’d booked the race-date weeks before,
And money flowed in at the door,
Old Dad and Mum rolled up in strength,
And everything seemed bright at last,
Because the sky was overcast.
At halfway through the show the crowd
Quite suddenly commenced to cheer ;
Howie wiped away a maudlin tear,
And pressed his heart, and smirked and bowed,
Till someone yelled, “Come off, you fraud,
It’s raining, that’s why they applaud!”

The world over, more people
ride on Goodyear Tyres than
on any other kind.
Making the best better
The Goodyear A //- Weather
dread has been improved .
Probably the world’s best-known tread
design for motor-car and truck tyres
has been and is the Goodyear All-
weather Tread.
Scientifically designed to meet and
conquer the varying conditions of any
street, road, highway, pavement or
boulevard the All-weather Tread has
always provided the maximum of
protection against skidding and side-
slipping, the maximum tractive power,
and at the same time the least interfer-
ence with the smoothness of the car’s
performance.
Until now it has seemed almost impos-
sible to improve in any way that tread
design, but the feat has been accom-
plished.
After months and months of experi-
menting and planning, Goodyear has
been able to change the design to an
extent that makes it still more efficient.
Furthermore, improvements have been
made in the body of the new cord tyre
itself, of which the new bevelled All-
weather Tread is an integral part.
The All-weather Tread on the new
Goodyear Cord Tyre is made from an
extraordinary and efficient rubber com-
pound—by far the most serviceable our
engineers have ever devised.
Being semi-flat instead of round, as
formerly, this new tread affords broader
road contact, and at the same time offers
greatly increased resistance to wear.
With no sacrifice of anti-slipping effici-
ency, the new Goodyear Bevelled All-
weather Tread runs more quietly and
evenly, while adding many miles to the
life of the tyre itself.
You can buy this improved Goodyear
Cord Tyre to-day at Service Stations
and dealers everywhere— at the same
price you are asked to pay for tyres of
lesser merit and of doubtful reputation.
Goodyear Means Good Wear.

Illustrating the value of the Oxy-
Acetylene process tp a specific industry
J jEHIND the work of the world’s millions is the
fabric of the world’s industrial equipment. From
the dark ages—the old world of chaos and ignor-
ance—civilization has developed in the light of reason and
thought into a vast industrial institution.
•
Vast steel structures rear their massive girders into the
clouds forever overshadowing the miserable mud huts of
the ancients. And this vast network of industrial con-
struction is made possible by the never-ending power of
Comox (Oxy-Acetylene) welding and cutting.
The illustration shows the use to which the Comox Blow-
pipe has been put —the daily work of an organisation that
ereds steel and manufactures ornamental iron work.
The steel work constructed by this company varies in size
and character—the fabrication of heavy bridge and build-
ing parts, girders and special shapes, and such products as
ornamental stairways, doors, grills, windows, gratings, metal
frames of every description and railway equipment and
specialities. On all of this colossal work, Oxy-Acetylene
cutting and welding is now indispensible because of its econ-
omy, also in making it possible to salvage and use a great
deal of metal that otherwise would have to be scrapped.
What a new light this throws on construdive industry!
What a development in commercial enterprise!
Comox (Oxy-Acetylene) welding is to-day firmly established
in Australia. Hundreds of successful jobs have demon-
strated its remarkable power, and hundreds of Comox
welders scattered throughout the Commonwealth have
made this proven work possible.

No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Footslogger: Thanks, but the Duster
Gentleman’s book was noticed long ago. It’s the
model on which half-a-dozen have since been built.
....Danny Cregan: You drown the sense in a torrent
of words—mostly adjectives. .. .Gipsy by Adoption:
Name, please... .T.T.S.: You don’t lay a bad egg,|
but you must cut out the cackle. MS. returned;
accordingly. .. .Titus A.: Why haven’t we taken offj
the gloves and handled Hickson? Well, chieflyj
because we think Hickson may inspire some sick,
people with enough confidence to cure themselves....
N.K.: Quite right; the verses headed “The Barred
Way” (B. 3/5/’23), signed “P. B. Prior,” were lifted
from Scribners, for which they were written by
Theodosia Garrison. Later contributions of the same
fraudulent character were “spotted” in time....
H. : Those things will happen. “Hausman”
(lt.P. 26/4/’23) should be Housman, of course....
Miss Riverina: It has been brought to the notice of
the Commissioner of Police... .S.Q.L.; “Neuropaths”
is written with too heavy a pen... .Ratoon: You
got into such a fog that we expected to hear of a
tollision any minute... .Malcolm D.: The Search Me
rolls into bad verse. And what was the voyage about,
anyway ?... .A.D.A.8.: The sonnets don’t carry the
weight.... Sydney B.: Goes ruggedly over the old
commonplaces.. . .H.E.R.: “The Moulder” is a strong
idea. Now l get to work and marry it to less anaemic
verse... .Mary M.: You don’t get the humor of it...
I. : Both slight; but one may pull through....
W.D.M.: Pretty crude even for first attempts....
D.P. (Maiyborough) : Too much like a ton ,of lead.
....Hazel C.: What is the secret of that “Throw-
back” yarn? About once in three months it reaches
us from some quarter. Is it due to wide-spread tele-
pathy or have the yarns a common parent?. .. .
M.D’A.: A tedious tale with the tip of it visible
from the nose of it....8.W. (Kensington) : Shocking
old gentleman !... .C.L.C.: No g00d... .C.J.C.: Don’t
know v'here the “citadel” of Sydney is; but as it
is “sleeping” it may be the telegraph office... .Alys:
Says the old thing in lumps.... J. 8.: It is our
proud privilege to now unveil the vivid picture:—
Last night I thought I heard a common roar,
Close to my residence on the North Shore;
But my wife she did say to me,,
“An explosion it must be.”
The loud sound and then the roar
Compelled me to think it must be more ;
When in the morning it was revealed,
The mystery last night concealed.
A dreadful explosion there had been
Of a small storehouse magazine;
Near Robb’s jetty it occurred,
The scene from whence the sound was heard.
The caretaker, observing a light therein,
Got two men to accompany him ;
But when he reached the door,
He knocked and tried to enter the store ;
When immediately he cried to the men “Clear out,”
Which they did without a doubt.
They obeyed the order, quick and true,
Ah, w'hat else could they do?
Then as quick as lightning flash,
An explosion occurred with terrific crash.
.. . .M.C.D.: After struggling with your pencil scrawl
we more or less guess that the stuff was not worth
it. .. .W.D.F.: Thin and weak. ...Talawong: Not
well enough carpentered. .. .Will V.: Horrible thing.
.. . .F.S. (Te Uku) : Poor. . . .A.L.C.: Old ideas in
pale verse.... D.A.R.: Doesn’t get within coo-ee....
Alice N.: Goes too heavily.... Everybody: Write
your name or pen-name on the copy, not on some
covering letter.... Antiquity: Bad verse in which
many false statements are made.., .L.N.C.: Seems
to be trying to say something w'orth while, but makes
an astonishingly bad job of it Kaban: Put more
thought into it; then more elbow-grease. These
literary jobs simply won’t do themselves N.O.
(Goulburn Valley) : Misses. Look up the pronuncia-
tion of “mirage ”... .White Cedar: No use here, but
not badly done... .W.J.T,: Doesn’t make a yam. ...
D.F.F.: Horrible imitation of many horrible things.
... .H.G. (Burwood): Too long and wordy....
H.G.R.: Not up... .I.B.B.: A weary, drab mass....
Huapai: Misses... .W.E.8.: Doesn’t persuade us it’s
true P.8.P. : None of them Efem : Not at all
bad; keep on J.L.S.: Leave off K.K.: Empty
little thing;.but it makes rather a pleasant noise...
5858: “Lappapai” is the best of a rather poor lot.
.. . .En Zed: Old and tired W.S.T.: No good
G.P.F.C.: You eke out too many lines with common-
place tags... .Arbeep: Don’t like it....Wonga: On
the sample, you are probably mistaken in thinking
you “can write verse in decent metre” .Cosbie:
Same old thing without freshness or thought....
Ivat: The sporting item has a quiet intensity:—
IN THIS SPRUCE AGE.
“Shooters put five shillings each into a pool. Then
engaged an aeroplane to fly to centre of swamp and
shoo the wild ducks closer to guns. But the ducks
ignored aeroplane.”
Was there ever a prophet who foretold
That sportsmen in this spruce age
Would a driver with an aeroplane engage
To shoo wild ducks? That would be bold.
But they dived under and chuckled at the driver
Trying he’s darnest to earn the fiver
Extracted from sports (but with pain)
Who stood in the swamp, waiting, patiently, in
vain.
.. . .E.L.M.W.: “Sir Thomas Gresham’s Grasshopper”
doesn’t go well in verse... .O.C. (Waverley) : Not
for u 5.... Panta G.: Variation of an old idea and
not a very thrilling one... .Biron: Narrowly misses
a place as a shocking example. . . .Mon Cher: Oh, but
you do make hard work of your humor. Half the
battle is to remove or conceal the marks of the
workshop. .. .T.T.C.: It limps here and there; see
what you can do with it.... Clarmore: Is it a poem
or a cobweb?... .P.P.S.: No meat in it... .Babbler:
You are the sort of exasperating writer who takes
his reader around four blocks (none of them inter-
esting) in order to reach a pub just across the street.
E.A.: “Ventriloquist” is a passable yarn; but
why not tell it. yourself? It is a mere complication
to put it into the mouth of a third party.... Sirius
Cove: Not enough in it. .. .N.K.J.: The weak point
is that’ message, on which everything hangs. Would
any lawyer put it that way?... .8.K.N.: Close up. ...
Kismet: In the name of the Prophet, figs!
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.J.F.; A very old and very smellful joke....
S.P.: Better study some more .N.J.: Drawing
shows promise; but not up to publication mark yet.
. ...M.8.: Well, the nigger is certainly black—
there’s that about him... .F.L.V.H.: 01d... .R.F.R.:
Hardly worth it.... 11.8.: Clean off the target....
.T.L.: Try something Australian. . . .A.S.: No improve-
ment. .. .B.B.: Next time Art calls pretend you’re
deaf... .S.H.: Not in The Bulletin's line; and the
drawing is weak, anyhow... .T.H.: As usual.

“Sucre”: Queensland cotton is not likely
to go “black.” Two flappers, neither of
them 18, picked 17001 b. in six working days.
Their pay envelopes contained £6 and £4

“Zimra”: This month London celebrates
the centenary of the “keb,” 12 of which
were licensed by the civic Bumbles of 1823.

But that didn’t come till the ’thirties.

give 142 ft. and a beating to its tallest Mel-
bourne competitor. The immense draught
required for the combustion of brown coal
necessitates such a sky-stabbeiv

“N’lmporte”: “Hal G.” mourns (B.
19/4/’23) that delicensed hotels never hold
up their heads again, but I can submit a
few exceptions. The old Quartzminers’
Arms at Ironbark (Bendigo) now sits up
defiantly as a Methody church. Its holy-
man is the popular sporting parson, Val
Trigge. The old Black Swan in Pall Mall
(Bendigo) now wears the meek face of a
Y.W.C.A. hostel. An even better known
hotel of other days was the Lamb Inn, Eliza-
beth-street, Melbourne, vdiere bushrangers
Morgan and Power bought an occasional
glass. Nowadays it is a bank.
“Salamander”: I don’t know whether all
the Bay boats—the Commonwealth’s big
liners—are alike ; I hope they are not, and
that the Moreton Bay is the bad exception.
Of the first-class cabins in that ship no
more than three are fit for human occu-
pation during a long voyage in the tropics.
The others are built over the galley; and
the heat often becomes so unbearable that
the passenger cannot put his naked foot to
the floor. That the Commonwealth should
accept pretty high passage-money from well-
wishers of public enterprise for the use of
such cabins amounts to something very like
a confidence trick. I don’t know whether
the line is really very anxious to sell these
first-class passages to and from England.
For the reputation of the line it shouldn’t
sell any more-—it should ireserve them
strictly for political deadheads.

“Cartot” : Recently there has been a great
demand for the tree known botanically as
Kingia australis., which grows in the coastal
country of southern Westralia, and quanti-
ties of it have been exported, principally to
Europe and the U.S.A. The stringy fibre
of the tree, which grows to a height of about
16ft., is excellent raw material for insula-
tion in cold-storage plants. The light outer
bark containing the fibre is cut up into ex-
ceedingly small fragments. These are treated
with preservative fluids, which remove un-
wanted matter as well, after which the resi-
due is reduced to pulp with acids and by
steaming under pressure. Rolling mills con-
vert the pulp into a form suitable for its
ultimate use. Already a number of large
plants in America and England have in-
stalled this material because it is better and
cheaper than others, and the refrigerating
departments of several ships have also been
fitted with it.

The cry of the mother: —
Someone remarks in The Bulletin (8/3/’23):
“Parents -will not apprentice their boys, preferring
the quick return which the high wage of unskilled
labor gives.” The parents are not the only ones
at fault. I have a lad of 14, He has gained a
prize for general proficiency in every year except
one that he has been going to school. I went to a
contractor here (Q.), a man who seems to get plenty
of business, and asked him if he. had room for an
apprentice. Unthinkingly he replied, “We are not
going to teach boys our trade.” He turned it off
afterwards by telling me of the stringent rules laid
down concerning the proportion of apprentices to
tradesmen. He added a note of unconscious humor
as I was leaving, by remarking with a sigh, “I
don’t know' w'hat we are going to do for tradesmen in
a few years.” One way of looking at the matter
seems to me to be this. In the old days lads
had to pay a fair sum, from £3O up, to be taught
a trade, and now I suppose small journeymen-bosses
think it is hardly fair to them to have to pay a
boy and teach him their calling at the same time.
THE HONORABLE AMEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“An extraordinary case was heard before Justice
Campbell, when Henry Blank was charged with
maliciously administering strychnine to a friend.
He said to the friend that he was sorry he had
poisoned him —he merely wanted to poison someone
else.”
When you feel the poison eating up your vitals like
a flame,
And the dew of death appears in clammy beads
upon your brow,
You need have no hesitation in apportioning the
blame:
You will know, old friend, I did it, also when
and where and how.
It was strychnine that you swallowed : I could not
afford cocaine,
And the same applies to laudanum, another costly
drug.
To the pharmacist who served me I said: “Will it
give him pain?”
His reply was: “Will it not? Such questions make
you look a mug.”
So I take it you will suffer as you’ never have
before;
I imagine that the anguish you are in for is
unique.
Still you’ll be in the position to take comfort on one
score
As the hand of Death proceeds to dim your eye
and pale your cheek.
You will know I never meant it; that, although
aware the gun
Had been loaded, yet I did not wish your harm-
less form to brown ;
’Twas another that I aimed at, and it quite de-
stroyed my fun
When I realised ’twas you that I had carelessly
brought down.

Gone aloft, Cap’n John Brisbane, formerly
Commodore-Captain of the Pacific Steam
Navigation Co. Since coming ashore he
lived on the old South Creek, now St. Mary’s
(N.S.W.), and he was 86 when his house
flag was half-masted.
“Pip Tok”: Don’t know whether this is
a malapropism or a case of mistaken iden-
tity. The Sarn.-Major had just finished be-
rating the awkward squad, and told them
they were like a flock of geese. Then he
relented a little and added: “But p’raps
there’s hope for ye. Afther all, it wuz the
geese that saved Rome from the Orange-
men.”
The elixir of life seems to be brewed
beyond the Mountains. Darvall Barton,
who counted his eightieth milestone last
week, was born on his father’s station,
•ooree, 20 miles west of what is now Orange
-—they used to call it Blackman’s Swamp
then. Mr. Barton preserves memories of
Kennedy the explorer, who was killed by the
blacks m Cape York Peninsula in IS4B‘ and
of Jacky Jacky, the faithful aboriginal who
ministered to Kennedy to the end.
Memories of “Morty” Muirhead, an orna-
mental and talkative lawyer of the last
generation in Adelaide, are revived bv the
appointment of one of his athletic sons as
S.M. He has been Associate to former
-fudges Ilomburg and Buchanan, and Regis-
trar in Industrial Courts. Now he gets the
Mount Gambier. Court, Haslam being trans-
ferred to Adelaide, and Tom Bright becom-
mg ac.ting-presMent of the Industrial Court
ot - .A. during Jethro Brown’s English trip.
T.R.H. ; Melbourne Sun the other day
Inferred to Lord Birkenhead as “a former
Chancellor of the Exchequer.” Birkenhead,
better known as Freddy Smith, was Lord
High Chancellor in the Lloyd George Coali-
tion Government, and in that capacity sat
i? ut, Woolsack and presided over the
Cppah House; but no Premier in his senses
woukl make him Chancellor of the Exchequer,
yvhen at the Bar he was supposed to be
making £25,000 a year and spending £30,000.
Mr Justice Darling, on arriving at Liver-
pool for the Assizes once, was told that the
huge stone building with the big golden dome
was new Customs House. “Indeed”
he said: ‘ I thought it must be Freddy Smith’s
chambers. Smith at the time was M.P.
cor the Walton Division of Liverpool.
D T Tll f97/5/*9Qi : T ' M ' , Barl °w, Sydney
ii.i. (27/4/ 23), reprints an m-memoriam
the death of James Harrison, “said
*> be the pioneer ice-maker.” Harrison was
sub-editor of the Age soon after its estab-
lishment in the early ’fifties, and for a while
he represented Geelong in Parliament. His
hobby was ice-making. He ruined himself
with it, lint lie made the ice. His first works
were in Franklyn-street, off Elizabeth-street.
I lived next door in 1859-60, and saw the
first ice made—not in blocks as to-day, but
in bars like pig-iron. Harrison died in pov-
and was buried in Geelong Cemetery,
and I understand that his grave is still un-
marked by stone or slab. Years later T. S.
Mort found capital for one Nicolle to manu-
facture ice, and after many experiments he
succeeded; but Harrison was the first in the
■world to manufacture “artificial” ice.
A couple of decades ago, when Peacock
was Premier of Yic. for the first time and
Chqmley was Police Chief, a constable up
Ballarat way was listed for the sack for
bending his elbow too frequently. When
he asked Peacock to intercede it was de-
cided to give him a holy fright. He was
summoned to the Premier’s room, and in
the presence of_ Chomley and Under-Sec.
lopp Peacock, in his severest manner, de-
clared that an example should be made of
him. Then pleading began, and eventually
Peacock asked Chomley and Topp to retire
to the next room and consider whether he
could be given another chance. While sweat
boiled out of the unfortunate John, the
1 olice Chief and Topp attended to other
departmental work for half-an-hour; then
they came in and said that if the culprit
cried off the liquor for the rest of his life
he would be given another chance. He pro-
mised, and Peacock expressed delight. “And
n ° w > gintlemen,” said the reinstated one
affably, ‘will ye come over to Johnny
Sheehans and have a taste with me?” Chom-
ley and Topp fled to laugh outside, and Pea-
cock yelled where he sat. But the jovial
John was never on the carpet afterwards.
“10-2-4’s” memory:—
Nothing the late John Norton ever wrote delighted
me so much as a turn I saw him do at the Hydro-
Majestic, Medlow. It was a pelting wet night. The
rain dripped through the defective roof of the most
abominable picture-gallery on earth, and on the
floor of the Saloon of Pleasure, or whatever high-
flown name they had in those days for the theatre,
small pools formed and slowly spread. Looking
somewhat self-conscious in unaccustomed evening
dress, the guests, who were about 60 per cent.
Hebrew, sat and watched a dreary amateur perform-
ance -organised by the Mistress of the Revels. A
young fellow was reciting “The Maniac’s Bride.”
All was depression and dampness and drip, the
nasal cries from the stage mingling with the shuflling
of the audience’s feet and the moaning of the wind
that surged up periodically from the valley below.
And then John Norton entered, and with him the
Spirits of Hope and Gaiety. He had had a few, as
the saying goes, and was feeling Napoleonic. Strid-
ing to the front he dropped into an armchair,
deposited an old felt hat on the floor beside him,
and fixed a bleak stare of disapproval on the per-
former. Presently his gaze wandered. On the
floor, within a foot or so of the stage near the
O.P. end, was a green frog. The eminent publicist
observed it with amazement. It was all wrong that'
such a creature Should be there at sucli a time.
Cautiously he rose, picked up his hat, and, stooping
low so as to avoid disturbing the recitation, crept
towards the intruder. The purpose of the hat now
became apparent. With a loud slap he brought it
down on the place where the frog would have
been had it not hopped a foot or so towards the
Prompt side of the stage. “The Maniac’s Bride”
went on, the Mistress of the Revels peered round
a piece of scenery and said “Ssh!”; the Master of
Ceremonies called “Order!” from the back of the
hall. But the spectators were out of hand. The Public
Guardian plodded doggedly after the frog, which,
so long as it remained fresh, eluded him with
ease. The whole length of the stage had been
traversed, the reciter’s voice had risen to a shout
and the audience was unaffectedly yelling with
pleasure, when, with a final swoop, the People’s
Friend secured his prey and bore it outside. For
the rest of that joyous evening any turn of an
even colorably humorous character got a madly
hilarious reception. And so, for that matter, did
the serious turns.

Better tyre chains
WEED DE LUXE CHAINS
NOW the makers of
the Weed Tyre
Chain—known by motor-
ists the wide world over
—announce an improved
chain: the Weed DeLuxe.
It gives maximum trac-
tion and protection from
skidding at a much lower
cost per mile.
First: note the Reinforcing
Link that now encircles each
main cross chain link; This
makes a four-point contact
with the road, instead of the
usual two. Increases the trac-
tion, holds the
wheels even
more firmly to the ground
and more than doubles the life
of the chain.
Then:
the new Lever-Locking Con-
necting Hook. You see its
advantages in a glance. Draws
the side chains together with
ease; locks securely under a
press of the thumb and re-
mains locked under all condi-
tions. The tension of the chains
has nothing to do with the
locking action of the hook.
This is important because the
chains must be attached loose
enough to “creep” around
freely, otherwise they injure
the tyres.
Made in sizes to fit all
tyres. Order of your
dealer.

Men! Try a Rexona Shave.
You’ll Enjoy It.
In half-a-minute Rexona Shaving Soap softens the beard,
and the lather will remain on the face with all its softness tor
twelve minutes, but Rexona shavers do not require this, for Rexona
Shaving Soap makes the beard so soft that a Rexona shave rea y
takes not more than two minutes.
A Rexona shave is a luxuriant yet an economical shave, for
the lather is over 150 times as great as the Soap used, and a 1/
triangular stick is sufficient to last the average man at least 150
shaves, which makes over eight shaves for a penny. * OC j
consider how much easier Rexona Shaving Soap makes the bear
on the razor, and how soft, smooth and antiseptic it leaves the
skin, and protects it from all weather conditions.
Being an antiseptic Medicated Soap, it has a tendency to
quickly heal any cut you may have the misfortune to get, and *
troubled with pimples or blotches of any kind, will daily tend to
improve them.
Men! Try Rexona Shaving Soap,
the new triangular stick—we can promise
you a new satisfaction.

It carries the reputation of the
maker. You can be sure he gave
every part careful thought that
it should function properly—that
it should operate smoothly.
And you can be sure also that
very special attention was given
to the lubricating system. Nothing
about a motor is of greater im-
portance than that.
But it’s up to you to supply the
right oil.
No matter how smoothly a
motor operates when new—
YOUR choice of the oil to be
used will determine whether that

Quest.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN this happy-hearted place
Wattle spins her golden lace ;
Through the lifting green it gleams,
Where the far sea-sapphire dreams
All the opal afternoon,
Till above the slender moon
Sunset shakes her apron fold,
Raining rubies on the gold.
Surely here shall end my quest—
In this last and loveliest
Heart o’ dreams, where drowsily
Sings the forest to the sea,
And, breeze-rippled, fold on fold,
lake a blown cascade of gold,
Wattle laughs at winter’s wrong,
Spinning color into song!
Lo, in nets of beauty caught,
This alone my soul has sought—
One far shore where blade and leaf
Knew no taint of human grief,
One lost isle, one glade unnamed,
Where Morn’s golden lightning flamed
Through green shadows to caress
Life in love with happiness.
This I sought and sought in vain.
Evermore a bride of pain.
Hapless and most royal-fair,
Beauty mocked her own despair.
Ever when the goal seemed near
Nature smiled and whispered “Here
’Twixt blue sky and forest green
Grief will be, or grief has been!”
Yet, ah ! sure, the banished dear
Gods of gladness linger here;
’Neath a sky so Grecian blue
Sappho’s heart seems beating through.
Surely here, where each green tress
Droops in gleaming quietness,
Ne’er shall darken frond or tree
Sorrow’s dreary fantasy !
In this happy-hearted place
Where gold wattle spins her lace,
All the trees are very still, _
Sleep and sunlight have their will —
Low the lips of Nature croon,
While above the slender moon
Rubies of the sunset gleam:
“Haply you have found your dream !

Donigo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
U T CAN’T refuse to celebrate the mar-
riage, Jackson. You understand that,
of course.” John Oswald Hicks,
resident magistrate of the West-Central Divi-
sion, gazed with troubled eyes at his early-
morning visitor. “Friday, I hold court at
Kalohi, and fine you for thrashing your
cook-boy; Monday, you take out a prohibi-
tion order against yourself, because you re
threatened with the jim-jams; now, you
calmly announce that the girl you expect to
marry will arrive by the Siai next ■ week-
end you ask me to tie the knot.” Then, in an
altered tone, “What about Donigo, Jackson.
Jackson, sprawling in the residency s only
serviceable lounge, seemed amused. felie
went back to her village weeks ago, he re-
plied. , „ , .
“Did you tell her about the Sydney girl t
“Not on your life! I gave her the run
of the trade-room and sent her old man a
caddy of tobacco, so she won’t make any
trouble. You know what these native women
are, Hicks.” „ , , TT . i
“No, I’m damned if I do,” snapped Hicks.
“But there was a kiddy, wasn’t there?
Where’s he? In the village, too?
“Really, my good policeman, your suspi-
cions pain me,” drawled Jackson, as he rose
to leave. “The youngster is at school at
Yule Island. He is in good hands, believe
me, So you may erase his name from your
register of half-caste children —if you keep
one.” „ „ ,i
Jackson picked his way carefully over the
crazy split-palm floor of the residency, and
a waiting native led his horse to the gate.
He mounted lightly, and, turning in the
saddle, remarked in an offhand tone: By
the way, Hicks, you needn t —er —that
1S “Don’t worry, Jackson,” broke in Hicks,
“I won’t put your pot on, if that’s what you
mean. You’ve been a damned nuisance m
this division for years, but I won’t tell the
new Kalohi sinabada what manner of man
you are. I only hope she doesn’t find it out
for herself, that’s all.” „
The two men parted, Jackson to return to
his mountain plantation 10 miles distant,
Hicks to the thousand and one duties which
tax the energies of a district-officer on a
Papuan out-station. , , .
William Jackson, owner of the Kalohi
rubber plantation, was a thorough-going
scamp, disliked and distrusted by white men
and natives alike. Sober, he was a polished,
plausible rogue, and Hicks could readily un-
derstand an unsophisticated Australian girl
being deceived by his superficial qualities of
mind and person. Drunk, he was a devil,
filled with an ape-cunning, which in moments
of passion developed into ferocity. His
“marriage” to Donigo, a comely native girl
from a near-by village, was really a case of
abduction, but by bribing the girls father
and intimidating the native witnesses, Jack-
son had escaped scot-free, and ever since
had snapped his fingers at Hicks and his
handful of native police. For five years the
girl had lived with Jackson.. She had borne
him a child, evinced no desire to return to
her own people, and had gradually become
attached to the man. Hicks refused to be-
lieve that she would regard the gift of a
few paltry trade goods as sufficient compen-
sation for the loss of her man, her home and
her child, and as he turned the problem over
in his mind that night his heart went out
in sympathy to the unknown girl of his own
race who day by day was drawing nearer to
Kalohi and ‘the arms of its blackguardly
owner.
* * * *
“Sail-ho-o-o!” bawled Corporal Bogi. A
gang of native convicts, filing out to work,
took up the cry. and Hicks knew that a faint
smudge had been discerned on the horizon,
denoting the approach of the rusty little
steamer which maintained an intermittent
service between Moresby and the district sta-
tions on the Papuan coast. His simple pre-
parations for the wedding were soon _ com-
plete. The bride wmuld step ashore in an
hour or so; but there was no sign of the
bridegroom. Hicks was conscious of a half-
formed wish that at the eleventh hour some-
thing—anything—might happen to prevent
this mockery of a marriage being solemnised.
At that moment the gate of the compound
swung open to admit a small native leading
two saddled horses. Hicks also observed that
he carried a cleft stick containing two letters.
One was addressed to himself, the other to
“Miss Joan Wills, s.s. Siai.” Hicks opened
one envelope resignedly.
“Dear Hicks,” he read. “That damned
culvert you promised to rebuild last year
collapsed under me this afternoon. I’ve lost
a good horse and damaged my leg. Afraid
I won’t be able to move for a day or two,
so please escort my little lady to Kalohi, and,
if you don’t object, we can be married here.”
The note bore Jackson’s signature, and was
dated the previous day.
An hour later Hicks found himself on the
untidy deck of the Siai shaking hands with
a radiant-eyed girl dressed in serviceable
khaki.
“When may we set out for Kalohi, Mr.
Hicks?” she asked pleadingly. “I am so
worried about my poor boy, and I feel that
I ought not to delay a minute.”
Hicks cursed the “poor boy” under _ his
breath, and motioned the skipper to go into
the chart-room.
“We shall leave in a few minutes, Miss
Wills,” he replied. “My business with the
captain will not delay us, and in the mean-
time my police will take your luggage ashore
and load the carriers.” #
Joining the skipper, he whispered: Does
she know what she’s coming to, captain?”
“She does not,” returned the skipper
gruffly. “The cow isn’t known in Moresby,
and I’m not man enough to put her wise.”
The eyes of the two men met for a frac-
tion of a second.
“I’ve passed my word to keep mum,
groaned the R.M. “Jackson has asked me
to marry them, and the law says I must. I
hope to God Dm doing the right thing.”
Half-way to Kalohi the little party passed
a handsome, well-built native girl, her grass
skirts swaying gracefully as she swung along
in the direction of the station. She. smiled
at Hicks, and stared curiously at his com-
panion. ,
“Good morning, Mis’ Hicks, she called.
“Good morning, Donigo.”
Hicks frowned. Had Jackson lied to him,
after all? , .
The journey passed pleasantly. The girl
rode well, and Hicks, to whom the society of
a white woman was as a breath of civilisa-
tion in the wilderness, almost forgot what
awaited her at the journey’s end. The red
roof of the Kalohi bungalow quickly brought
him to earth as he realised with a pang that,
within half-an-hour, he would be scrawling
his signature to a document which would
bind his smiling companion to a drunken,
evil-living blackguard, unworthy the regard
of even a city street-walker.
Hicks shuddered with disgust, but, point-
ing with his switch, said: “Your new home,
Miss Wills.” , ,
The girl thrilled at his words, and pressed
forward with impatient eagerness.
“I’ll go ahead, Mr. Hicks,” she gasped
happily, and her horse broke into a canter.
Hicks passed the word to his corporal to
hurry on the carriers, and followed at a
more leisurely pace. As he entered the
clearing the girl was dismounting at the
entrance to the bungalow.
Passing swiftly up the steps, she turned
to the bedroom and called out gaily: “Willy,
boy, here I am!” He saw her swing open
the folding doors and enter the room. There
was a piercing scream as she stumbled
blindly from the room ; then, turning a white,
stricken face in his direction, she crumpled
in a heap on the floor. .
Hicks was by the side of the fainting girl
before the echo of her cry had died away.
A glance into the bedroom was enough. Lying
on a camp stretcher, his face horribly dis-
torted, lay Jackson. The barbed point of
a black-palm spear projected through his
chest. Hicks knew that he had been dead
for some hours.
Making a hasty search of the house, the
magistrate discovered Gaduweli, the mur-
dered man’s cook-boy, lying on his back in
the kitchen. He was sound asleep, but
whether his slumber was real or pretended
Hicks could not determine. Gripping the
sleeper by his woolly hair, Hicks dragged him
to his feet. . ,
“Donigo he stop here night-time/ he
asked. , , ,
“He stop,” quavered the boy. Taubada
bin send him ’long village, he stop one moon ;
las’ night, sun-he-go-down, Donigo he come
back ’long taubada. Morning time he go
bush ; talk ’long Gavamani, I t’ink.”
Hicks grasped the thoroughly frightened
native by the elbow, and led him to the bed-
room. At the sight of his murdered master
the boy’s'dusky skin turned grey with fear.
“True I talk, taubada,” he yelled. Ino
savee”
“Hereva lasi” (shut up!), growled Hicks.
Corporal Bogi and his police were now
approaching the bungalow. Miss Wills, sob-
bing convulsively, lay face downward on the
lounge; and Hicks came to a decision.
“Corporal!” he called, thrusting his pri-
soner forward, “handcuff this man.”
The boy lifted his voice and howled. _
“Peace, foolish one,” growled Bogi, in
Motuan. “Does not the Big Gavamani know
what is best for Suau cockroaches such as
you.”
The girl sat up, red-eyed with weeping, but
now quite calm.
“The case is quite clear, Miss Wills, said
the R.M. “This boy bears a bad character
in the division, and hated his master. Oidy
last week he attacked Mr. Jackson with a
tomahawk, and I had to pay a hurried visit
to the place to prevent bloodshed. Seized
with the blood-lust during the night, and
knowing his master to be helpless, he cut a
hole in the palm flooring under the bed and
speared poor Jackson while he slept.”
They buried Jackson under a flowering
flame-tree in the clearing. The police car-
ried the body to its shallow grave, and Hicks,
the white-faced girl by his side, recited all
he could remember of the service for the
Burial of the Dead. The simple rites over,
Hicks and liis companion returned to the
silent bungalow.

You cannot afford to be without Zam-Buk,
the healer which safeguards your everyday injuries
against festering and blood-poison. Zam-Buk is
also invaluable for Eczema, Bad Legs, Piles, Ring-
worm, Children’s Sores and Rashes, Boils and similar
skin affections. Qet a box to-day from your
Chemist or Storekeeper.
Seldom a day passes without one of the family
happening an accident. Mother or housekeeper cannot
escape cuts, scalds and burns. Children are forever
bruising and scraping their limbs and faces; father and
the boys get nasty mishaps at work that need prompt,
intelligent treatment. It is the instant effectiveness of
Zam-Buk that makes this famous herbal balm such a
valuable boon.
For its wide range of utility, its simplicity and ever-
ready character, Zam-Buk is well described A Surgery
in a Two-inch Box.” Its action on the skin is threefold
First, wherever there is pain, soreness, irritation or
inflammation, Zam-Buk is instantly soothing and cooling.
Secondly, Zam-Buk purifies the tissues, killing off disease
germs, and averting dangerous festering and blood-
poisoning. Then, when it has soothed and antiseptically
purified the sore or injured place, Zam-Buk induces
swift perfect healing with new healthy skin.

“We can do nothing more, Miss Wills,” he
said. “I think you had better return with
me to the station. The Siai does not call
in on her return trip, but I will signal the
skipper to pick you up. You should arrive
at Moresby in time for the next steamer
south; the authorities there will not detain
you, and you will be able to slip away with-
out any unpleasant publicity.”
“You have been very kind and thoughtful,
Mr. Hicks,” she replied tremulously. “Let
us go now, please.”
* * # *
Hicks paced the narrow verandah of the
residency, and thoughtfully watched the Siai,
now liull-dow r n on the horizon, heading for
Moresby. _ Corporal Bogi, an immobile figure
in red-braided blue, stood stiffly at attention
awaiting his master’s orders.
“Corporal!” barked the R.M. suddenly.
“Yessah!’
“Release Gaduweli. Give him some to-
bacco and send him back to Kalohi.”
“Yessah!” and Bogi departed on his
errand. He returned in a few minutes,
saluted smartly, and stood waiting.
“Donigo here, Corporal?”
“Yessah!” answered Bogi. “He stop
’long my house.”
“Bring her in, Corporal,” said Hicks. “We
make court now.”
TAUWARRA.
Faith.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS the doctor came in through his own
gate, underneath the red light, the
feeling of depression that had lain
heavily on him all day grew more acute. He
was suffering from one of his sick headaches,
but the cloud on his mind had no mere physi-
cal cause. lie was out of love with life
and with his fellow-men. Worse than that,
he had begun to lose faith in himself.
That afternoon, as he had been attending
to a long string of lodge-patients, a sudden
wave of exasperation at the indignity of his
work had swept over him. “A crowd of
hypochondriacs!” he told himself. “I’m
more in need of medical attention than they
are.” Yet it was not their fancied ailments
that offended him so much as their perfunc-
tory way of approaching the temple of heal-
ing: “I’ve got a bit of a cough, Doctor. It
don’t let me sleep too well of nights. Per-
haps you could give me something to put it
right.” They seemed to regard him as a
sort of shop-assistant, handing out known
remedies over a counter. No mystery sur-
rounded him, such as clung to Potter, the
faith-healer, or to the Chinese herbalists they
went to at times!
In moments of disillusionment like this he
saw himself as a little, over-strained man,
living' in a stuffy atmosphere of drugs and
derelicts, and spurned by a radiant humanity
that went on its way believing that every
day in every way it was growing better and
better. Yet once the conviction that his owm
calling was the highest of all had been a
'strong support for him in a life that had
been full of petty failures and disappoint-
ments.
The house, with its front of dull brick,
seemed shabby and furtive as he climbed the
stone steps and let himself in at the door.
Somehow the shrubs of the garden always
looked dusty and dry, no matter how much
they were watered. A warm breath, tinged
with iodoform, met him as he passed the
surgery and affected him unpleasantly.
“Mrs. Elvery’s gone out,” the girl told
him in the hall.
“Gone out?”
“She had dinner early, and Miss McKin-
lay called for her. She told me to tell you
she’d be home about 11.”
“Yes, yes: that’s all right.”
He knew perfectly well where she had
gone. There was a faith-healer advertised
to speak in the next suburb, and the McKin-
lay woman, who ran after every novelty,
had carried her off to hear him. It seemed
to him that his wife would rather accept
the advice of a quack about her neuritis
than be cured by her lawful husband.
“Sheer credulity!” he told himself. “The
world’s going back to the days of the witch-
doctors.”
Aloud lie said to the girl, who had only
come back the week before, after an attack
of antemia: “And how are you getting on
now, Gladys? Improved?”
“Oh, yes, thanks,” she responded. “Every
day PIH feeling better—in every way.”
Elvery flinched, and hung his hat up on
the hallstand, looking at himself in the
glass. The reflection was not reassuring.
His scanty crop of hair did not hide his bald-
ness, and his skin had a whitish, unhealthy
appearance. There was a hint of strain in
the pale, blue eyes that peered through their
gold-rimmed glasses, and nowhere was there
evidence of the vitality that should belong
to a healer of men. If he could not sleep
better, he told himself, he would be forced
to take bromide.
He ate his solitary dinner and went into
the sitting-room, spreading himself on the
lounge and taking up an evening paper. “The
Meaning of Coudism” caught his eye, and
he turned the page. Yet he could not read.
The emptiness of the evening that lay ahead
of him appalled him, and, when he looked
around, the furniture of the room got on his
nerves. He had never noticed it in such
detail before. There was the marble clock
of German pattern, the engravings of Land-
seer and Rosa Bonheur, the revolving book-
case full of medical works, the monthly
magazines on the round table, and the four
stiff chairs. The room was sometimes used
by patients who were waiting, and every
inch of it ached with lack of personality.
The doctor pored over the cable-headings,
but all the time he was thinking that Mar-
garet was just then drinking in the words of
the faith-healer, the McKinlay woman sit-
ting beside her in silent communion. He
could see their rapt faces and the credulous
eyes! And he remembered that Atherton
had told him in the train that evening that
his wife had greatly improved since she had
become interested in Christian Science. The
impudence of this assertion made him flush
still, for, not long before, Atherton’s wife
had come to him for treatment.
“It’s the day of the witch-doctor,” he kept
repeating to himself.
He had started the article on Coueism
when his eyes grew blurred and he became
dimly aware of a noise outside the house.
What could it be? A gang of larrikins!
The noise grew louder, and he made a move-
ment to go out and see what it was, but a
paralysis seemed to be laid upon him and his
limbs would not obey him. He lay still,
listening, and steadily a little fear crept
through him, penetrating his heart. Yet
what was there to be afraid of? He tried
to reason it out, but with an increasing
sense of dread he felt a knocking at his ribs
and was seized by an overpowering impulse
to hide himself from the crowd that had
gathered in the garden.
What was it they wanted? Where had
they come from? Generally the streets of
the suburb were deserted till people began to
trickle home from the theatres and picture-
shows, but now a horde of frenzied men
seemed to be pouring out of the dark into his
garden. His instinct told him that, for
some reason or other, they were after him.
And he was alone in the house! Evten
Gladys seemed to have disappeared.
He lay still; straining his ears to catch
some meaning in the clamor that was more
like the growling of beasts than any human
sound. Faintly to his senses there came a
strange smell, a musty odor, that he seemed
to remember from some former existence.
The dank air of the jungle was around him.
Was that a tom-tom that was beating in
the background?
And then in a moment he knew. The sor-
cerers had triumphed, and they were smell-
ing out their rivals in the art of healing!
All the gross, barbaric instincts of men
had been unloosed, and the followers of true
science were being hunted down. It was
natural that the first outburst of their pas-
sion should be concentrated upon him. He
had foreseen this day, and had fought against
the witch-doctors with all his power. Now
they were having their revenge. The rattling
of bones and dried snake-skins was in his
ears, and he had a sense of wild fiends storm-
ing through his surgery, smashing his instru-
ments and laying everything waste. Soon
his library of medical works would go up
in flame.
“Beasts!” he cried, trying to spring up.
But something seemed to grip him and
hold him down. He felt a buzzing in his
ears, and knew that an awful presence was
standing over him, beating down his will to
resist, and casting on him a paralysis that
was worse than death. It came closer and
closer. He lay still, his heart swelling as
though it would burst....
“Are you awake, Doctor?” said a distant
voice.
“Yes, yes,” he mumbled mechanically,
opening his eyes with an effort.
The girl was standing near him, hesitat-
ing- and indecisive.
“What is it?” he blurted out.
“There’s a woman in Clyde-street ringing
up for you to come,” said the girl. “Her
little boy’s got the croup—bad.”
“All right,” he said, fumbling for his
glasses, “I thought I heard the tom —tele-
phone... .What time is it?”
“Just after ten,” said the girl.
Somewhat muzzily he moved into the sur-
gery and began to put his things together.
The cloud was still on his mind.
“If Mrs. Elvery comes home before I do,
tell her where I’ve gone,” he said to the girl
as he opened the door to go out.
His headache had passed, but he still felt
as if he were moving in a dream. The streets
were uncannily silent, and not a figure moved
except the occasional faint form of a man
plying his hose in the dusk, of his garden.
A queer smell still haunted the doctor's
senses, and the overhanging trees had a dark,
secret look. As he passed through the empty
streets, with their black patches of shadow,
he could hardly keep from glancing ner-
vously behind him, so acute was his feeling
of being an outcast and a fugitive.
But when he reached his destination in
Clyde-street everything seemed to come sud-
denly right. From out of the house of sick-
ness came an atmosphere - that allowed him
to breathe freely and restored him to him-
self. There was a deference in the voice of
the woman who spoke to him, a feeling of
doors quietly opening in front of him every-
where, of faith flowing toward him and en-
tering into him. He was no longer human
and ineffectual. As he moved down the hall
he felt a divine being, omnipotent, benign,
wrapped in mystery and awe.
“Is it the doctor?” ho heard someone
whisper.
“Yes, the doctor's come.”
Out to the very kitchen the name seemed
to float in a litany of faith and reassurance.
“It’s all right. The doctor’s here.”
A warm glow pervaded him, a sense of
exaltation, and his movements about the sick
bed had the poise and sureness of a priest’s
at the altar.
VANCE PALMER.
One Came.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Walls cannot cage this eager heart of mine.
I shall arise,
Seek till I find that magic place I know
’Neath alien skies.
Blue waters croon beside its cloistered ways,
Murmurous with bees;
The plaintive songs of doves through yellow
hours
Fall from its trees.
Across its emerald terraces, I know,
Proud peacocks pass ;
Their painted shadows flung fantastically
Along the grass.
And beauteous as a dream of poet hearts
The radiant sheen
Of fountains beckoning with their rainbow
hands
Through bowers of green.
Heart, you remember how at evening’s close
One always came
Eagerly ' down those cloistered, fragrant
ways—
Love was his name.
