Death in Life .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is the Night that weeps—it is not I.
The ram flashed >on my pallid cheek, and seemed
Like mine own tears; but weeping-time’s gone by:
Dry-eyed I wake from the sweet dream I
dreamed.
It is the Wind that sighs—it is not I.
Though low I crouch with ashes on my head,
My breath comes slow—too cold to moan or sigh :
The living only grieve, and not the dead.
It is the Sea that sobs—it is not I
Wailing and sobbing on the misty shore,
Like some wild living thing in agony
That strains to unreached Joy for evermore.
Alas ! tis only Life that weeps and sighs—
Life with quick feaus and quenchless hope still
fed !
Death cannot hope or fear, or ever rise
From out its thrice-sealed grave—and I am
dead 1

The Mew from Brummagem.
And they crucified him, and parted his gar-
merits, casting lots.” Parkes’s literary garments
nave been parted among several hands; and it
looks as if the oruoifixion did not precede—is still
to follow. “An Emigrant’s Home Letters, by
Henry Parkes, with preface and notes by Annie
T. Parkes ” (Angus and Robertson) is first in the
field of posthumous literature, and it rudely
tears away most of the few rags of personal
reputation that remained to the old man
from Birmingham. Miss Parkes (his daughter)
oif ’ n? f C c ou £ s ? J , n ,° conception of this. Like
all other of Parkes s female relatives—like nearly
a 1 women with whom he came in contact-
she appears to have been thoroughly dominated
by his personality, thoroughly deceived by his
professions and posturings. .Her literary attitude
is that of a votary at a shrine : she is gushful, and
feminine, and overwhelmed by the honor of her
parentage I send forth these pages,” she says,
to tell their simple story of how, in spite of
outer poverty, much hardship, and utter want of
education, Henry Parkes fought his way to ever-
lastnig fame.’ “The mistakes, the errors, and
the failures of the last years of his life will be
wnped away as one would brush dust from a be-
loved dead face. Who that is just will judge of
wu- u 7 • bet ween seventy and eighty?”
Which is filially magnificent, but by no means
sense. As applied to such a career as Parkes’s
perhaps to any career—“everlasting fame” ha
no meaning. What perpetuity does this ridicu
lous planet, in the revolutions of a score of thou
sand years, reserve for the memory of the verv
greatest of her sons? Nor can a truthful bio
grapher choose any part of sis subject’? life aud
say: Forget all the rest; judge sim by this.’
Parkes must be judged by his whole record, his tota
result, and there are many who, even in the ore
sent when Ins deeds bulk large, find bis career on
of high potencies, of great opportunities, and o :
comparatively poor and ignoble performance.
* * * *
Parkes spent his youth and early manhood in and
about Birmingham—“old Brummagen,” as h
calls it. He was married in 1836, left Binning
ham for London late in 1838, London for Aus
tralia in March, 1839. His daughter’s book re
prints 31 letters, chiefly addressed to his aides
sister Sarah, written during his stay in Lon
don and up to four years after he reached
Australia. There are also two letters written by
his first wife, Clarinda Varney ; and an appendix
of two sets of valueless verses by Parkes, and
letter from J G. Hornblower, a youthful com
panion of sent m response to his daugh
ters request for information concerning his earlier
years. Brother Hornblower, however, does not
blow for Parkes to any great extent, though he
mentions that P. put him to use (characteristi-
cally) to print some verses in many an hour of
overtime, unknown to his employer. And Brother
Hornblower concludes that he “ shall always feel
a pride in having been associated with one who has
■ ' W £ n l or himself th e most coveted honor
iungland s Queen can bestow ” —which is Greek
pure and simple.
* * * *
Parkes’s letters present him as a heartless ego-
tist, prodigal of fine language and insincere senti-
“Tr' u t They i - ha X e no Bterary value, but give
sidelights on his character which go to make more
vI i V J u HE Bulletin’s conception of him as a
selfish poser-ruthlessly selfish, posing continu-
ously The sty.e is like the man-alwavs
grandiose never grand. Apart from its personal
interest, the. matter has little or none. Parkes’s
chmf theme was himself and his wants. Only
, n hero-worship could have assaulted
the public with trivialities like “You had better
put the brown paper package in the rabbit-pen,
and be sure that the boards are nailed down on
e ye n such passages give a glimpse of
the real Parkes. He was as full of advice as he
was empty of cash. In his second letter he tells
now lam in debt to Mr. Porter ” —a Birming-
ham surgeon “and have been so for a shameful
longtime.” “I owe,” at the very outset of his
career- I owe” at its ending. They were the
Alpha and Omega of Parkes, those letters I O,
standing for egotism and improvidence the
whole man lay between them. Apparently “ Mr.
Porter ” went unpaid to the end.
Parkes s name and fame were built on poor
sacrificed women’s hearts and lives. His selfish-
ness was invincible, brutal. Wretched indeed
household which he left in Birmingham
in I©3B. Hi aged father was sick and often out
of work; his aged mother an invalid ; the hard
toil of his sisters kept the home together. When
Paikes conceived the idea of emigration, he was
apparently too impatient to save a small fund to
pay his expenses. A fortnight or so after reaching
Bondon he had only 4d. left. His sisters stinted
themselves to send him money, tools, and such
articles as they thought would be useful to him :
and various poor relatives were laid under con-
tribution for a few shillings to help the emigrants.
Parkes took all cheerfully, and repaid the poor
creatures in Grand isonian blessings and promises
to repay when he got to Australia. How they
lose u “ Im and slaved for him ! On Deo. 7,
1000, he acknowledges four half-crowns, and a
parcel of stuff, and “ was quite overpowered with
the sense of your kindness.” On December 31st
he acknowledges another parcel, and bemoans his
distresses.
But believe me, I do not tell you of my misery to make
jou miserable. Oh no ! I hope you will not be more un-
PW on my account than if I was living in the most
perfect prosperity, though I wish your sympathy in
believing I do not deserve all I suffer.
The fellow is never done posing—or begging. “If
Booker would make my shoes,” he writes on Jan.
IBt, 1839, to poor Sarah, “and you think you
could pay him in two months after I am gone, I
should be very glad to have them.” It is I—l—l
throughout the letters, with perfunctory refer-
ences to Clarinda, and formal protestations of
solicitude. But there is not a heartcry in all the
catalogue of his carefully polished phrases.
Glarinda s unpremeditated affection puts him to
shame. My heart feels bursting with gratitude
to you all, she writes. “ Once more I thank you
tor your unspeakable kindness.” Parkes weeps
with one eye only ; the other is always glued to
the mam chance.
* * * *
But he means to repay all the kindness shown
him. On March Ist he writes : “If I get a situa-
tion at *.50 or £6O a year and a house to live in, I
shall be able to send some money heme in a year
and a-half from the present time, and enough
soon to pay all IO in Birmingham. And that,”
says the humorous dog (though perhaps he meant
it, or convinced himself he meant it) “will be a
happy time with me.” Anon he bursts into
ecstasies of largiloquenb emotion :
mother ' my fond, affectionate
parents. God Almighty bless them, and provide for their
few remaining years better than I can tiope they will be
they be daily surprised with eom-
torts, and may floods of unexpected joy continually
descend into their hearts, &c., &c. J
This is very rich, considering that this devoted
son was ab that moment consulting his own ends
b y emigrating, leaving his old parents to be sup-
ported by his sisters. But Parkes is an incurable
phrase-maker—a sorb of Complete Letter-Writer
—with a Johnsonian sentence pat for every occa-
sion. And he was proud of ’em, too ;he gave his
consent to the publication of these letters; and
Miss Parkes is quite taken in, and praises their
style as beautiful.” Doubtless the simple
women who received them were taken in too.
* * * *
On March 17tb, 1839, Parkes is acknowledging
receipt of another parcel, and is “quite surprised
with the things you have sent. I fear you are
suffering very much yourself by helping us so
greatly. Bub he took ’em all right; and when
poor Sarah scraped up 7s. for a portrait of him he
spentlit incarting his luggage to Gravesend—which
was doubtless necessary, yet a less selfish brother
might surely have managed to give his faithful
sister this small gratification—out of her own
money. However, he is going to make up for all •
If i get a situation I will obtain <£lo and send
with my first letter from Sydney.” On March
™ h 7°FT last kind parcel;” on
March 26th he thanks his father “ for the seeds
and for the sovereign you sent me. I am
afraid you must have pub yourself to great
inconvenience to send me the money. I
hope I shall soon be able to return 'b tenfold.”
On March 31sb (still crying “ Give ! Give 1 ”)
he writes from Plymouth: “Do try to send us
two or three little things to take with us. /do
think / shall die on sea-biscuit and salt beef before
/ get to Sydney.” Parkes had always a nice
stomach.
Well, he reached Sydney on July 25, 1839
knew that the people who loved him, who hac
starved themselves and stripped themselves ba
for him, were hungering for his news, and he nev
wrote them a line till May 1, 1840—all but aye
later. VVliat a time of misery and suspense f
those loving hearts ! His excuse was that he liar
no good ) news, and—here is the real reason—th
he didn’t like to wound his vanity by confessin
that things hadn’t turned out as well as he foi
told to the prophets of evil at home. For s
months Parkes had indeed to work hard for sma
pay as a laborer up-country. Then he came
Sydney, and got ss. a day finishing brasswork
Russell Bros. Fourteen months after arrival
had a billet in the Customs, had made i
fluential friends, and represents himself
in a situation which promises not on
to provide me comfortable bread, but to en
able me to save a little money.’’ But there is m
a word of repaying his obligations to the siste
who stewed and scraped to outfit him, or of th
which he was going to send at once. H
contents himself with invoking God’s blessin
?cL r 0 with great re g ulari ty- On May 24th
’ • sa y s f* e “ expeeted to hear of misery anc

amuse myself . . . and it is my intention to remit som
money home as soon as possible.
* * * *
On May 21, 1841, nearly two years after ar
rival he sends “a few shells, and a little of our
and baby s hair,” and the blessing of the Fathe

But no cash. On 23rd Jan., 1842, he sends fine

all and sundry, but no cash. On 3rd Sept., 1842
more than three years after arrival— he sends

would gladly have shared to alleviate (1 ! !)
—and “unabated affection ’’—but no cash.
* » * *
On Jan. 26th, 1843, Parkes hears of the death
or his mother, and rises to the occasion in a
beautiful letter of empty phrases. The style

When I knew for a certainty that I should see that
dearest face no more-that she, whose love for us
gathered strength from affliction and misfortune was
now testing in the grave and could no longer participate

my mother indeed was dead, I felt as if a portion of this
world’s beauty was lost to me for ever. P J
The well-fed, “comfortable” Parkes, sur-
rounded by his collection of the best authors,
complacently calculating his periods over his
mother s cofhn-che mother who had been stinted
that his wants might be satisfied, the mother who
had lived in poverty and died in wretchedness, the
mother to whom, three-and-a-half years after his
arrival in Australia, he had sent not one Solitary
stiver—not even in repayment of the ad vances for
his outfit screwed out of his sisters’ miserable
earnings!—what a spectacle ! Sister Sarah her-
m6eki : long ' sl offering, self-saorifioing

And the last letter of the series records the de-

The series of letters is most characteristic. It
a regular 10 pasan. It shows Parkes in the
beginning as he was in the end-selfish, impro-
vident, hypocritical—possibly so hypocritical that
he deceived even himself. How such a record
could be published by a daughter would pass conf-
prehension were not the glamor which Parkes cast
Fo e r r th h ’ S i7’ omeniind fair } iliar an «i well-proven.
For the insincerity of the letters is obvious to the
meanest unprejudiced comprehension. They are
pondence “.“fife’ the Br, ™ a gem goods of corres-
pondence—a tithing memorial of the man who was
Brummagem first, Brummagem last, Brummagem
from top to toe, always and eternally Brummagem
Items.
Louis Becke, at last advices, had torn hii
self free from his London entertainers, ungrat
rally refusing Queen Vio.’s pressing invitation
spend a month at Balmoral, and set sail f

are a-building. For he has definitely left liter
pure tor commerce, it seems, and is to establish a
immense bouth Sea trading emporium for a fir
of Continental candle-makers, which looks like'
to be productive of many more dollars than th
most dolorous of brown-woman idylls, Bu
doubtless there will be cracks and interstice
through which Becke’s narrative faculty will pee
now and again.

Crundy? or was she the original Mrs. Grundv

old Flutarch ? She had 12 children, and only
managed to rear three to adult age—not much o
the mother there. Probably she was so occupied in
the contemplation of her own virtues that she lef
them to*the nurse-girls. And she wasn’t unselfisl
enough to ask Gracchus to kill her snake. Grac
chus found two snakes in his bed, one male ant

JJoubtless Caius and Tiberius drew their virtues
from him. In my humble opinion, Cornelia
was selfish and heartless : she used to re
proacb her sons that she was still called the
mother-in-law of Scipio, nob the mother of the
Gracchi, and so egged Tiberius on to his ruin—
just to gratify her personal ambition. And that

history can be made when sauced with a little

Cobb, And he does, manfully. He even carries
his defence into literature, quotes the harrowing
tale of the lost Bill or Jim in the Australian
desert whose eyes are picked out by the crow
almost before his death-struggle ceases, andshrewd-
ly enquires how Bill came back to tell the tale; or,
if Jim saw him die, why he didn’t drive the crows
awa,y ; and where is there any reliable affidavit
again the crow, anyway? The Bulletin, as
one or Bill s patrons, shamefacedly admits that it
doesn b know, and passes the question on to Jim.
Zadig : ‘lt was noted at Poverty Point re-
cently that HenriMurger’scharmingbook, “Scenes
de la Vie de Boheme,” has been dramatised in
America, where it has succeeded “Trilby” in
point of popularity. The play should thoroughly
deserve its success, for, though the book lacks
great central figures like Trilby and Svengali, its
characters are more human, and from cover to
cover it breathes an aroma of the vagabond life of
poverty and plenty, constancy and fickleness, and
all the various vicissitudes that have made their
youth in the Q&artiW Latin an affectionate re-
membrance for so many. And, unlike “Trilby”
it is never tiresome. It has no pages of “ author”
to be skipped ; no stupid epilogue ; and the pathos
is never lengthened to tedium. For it is pathetic.
Where is there anything more touching than the
beautiful little tale, “Le Manchon de Francine ”?
or, to go to the other extreme, so humorous as the
first sketch in the book, “Comment fut institne
Je cenacle, or the story of Ali Rodolphe, whose
address is given as “ Avenue de Saint-Cloud, dans
le troisieme arbre & gauche en sortant du bois de

Trilby ’ ? Always shy of falling in with a
craze, I yet think this the best English novel
since Adam Bede,’ or I will let down a peg and
say Ihe Moonstone.’ Most of its vogue is of
course, factitious. We will not -insult Dickens,
lhackeray, or Scott. Yet, intrinsically, and
bearing m mind what it only claims to be,
Xrilby is first-class Frenchy literary work. I
have not heard, though, whether it excites the
admiration of Bourgeb, Daudet, and the other
masters, bub I fancy they are warned off and
biassed by the stupidity of the quite unreasonable
T Trilby ’ naturally stinks in the nostrils
of the London criticasters for this reason. The

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience'delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,— Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during; which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. X write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my hoy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tatmvorth, N.S. W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-

himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded , the weak and debilitated consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.

Dr. GrIBTSOKTS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS Sc SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
prolession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow' discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, fee.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

[TESTIMONIAL.!
Dear Sir, Spring Vale.
I have much pleasure in testifying to the real merits of your “ Bioplastine.” After using all other remedies for a
number of years I unhesitatingly give this the preference. My neuralgia has departed and my nerves made strong.
I have induced several persons to give your tonic a trial, with very gratifying results. One lady, a sufferer from
indigestion, felt quite a new creature after taking one bottle of “ Bioplastine.”

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

*‘Some years ago I suffered from rheuma-
tism and lumbago. Warner’s ‘ Safe’ Cure, ot
which I used a number of bottles, relieved
me '” T. B. KENNY, Solicitor.
64 Clarence Street, Sydney, N.S.W.,
September 6,1895.
“ I merely wish voluntarily to testify to the
efficacy of Warner’s ‘ Safe’ Cure, although I
am inclined to think it almost superfluous,
seeing the number of similar ones from all
parts of the civilised world; nevertheless, I
must add my quota for the benefit of my fel-
low creatures.
I need not particularise, but say that I was
a sufferer from weakness and debility conse-
quent upon long residence in foreign coun-
tries, the climates of which were very varied
and extreme, and have been completely re-
stored to the full vigour of health by using
Warner’s ‘ Safe ’ Cure." THO. SLOAN.
Bendigo, Victoria,
January 17,1896.
“ 1 was a victim to liver disease, and grew
worse, although treated by several medical
men. I then began taking Warner’s ‘Safe’
Cure, and three bottles afforded relief, and
when I had used a dozen bottles I was cured.
To show the permanency of the cure I should
add that this was some six years ago.’’

A Fast Yaokee.
There are tens of thousands in THE STATES, and not
a few in our own Australia. The descendant of that
Georsre Washington WHO NEVER TOLD A LI >
product of a mighty nation ; the YANKEE, as contriver,
inventor, fixer-up of fakements, and general smasher-up
of old-time theories, bestrides the narrow woild like a
COLOSSUS, so that the eyes of all people are fixed on tne
land that answers to the call of
HAIL! COLUMBIA!
Yes, they are hard to beat; of that there is
surety —both in contemporary opinion and in the evidence
of experts of distinction. This may also be said ot

THE HOME-COMING.
Bail up, old Roany !
Quick ! For the sun is low.
Then to the creek bed stony,
Then to the lucerne go.
See, all the ridges glow ;
The white moon begins to show ;
And through the scrub my Tony
Jogs briskly along, I know.
High on Drumrossum
He boiled his quart mid-day;
A cliff, white with blossom,
Showed me a cloud of grey.
What lots he will have to say—
He’s been such an age away;
And Andy, my little possum,
Dad’s coming home to stay.
Run, little Andy!
That is his whip I hear.
Tanned, and saddle-bandy,
Comes home your Daddy, dear.
Run, for he must be near;
Let down the rails for cheer.
Show him how strong and handy
You’ve grown in the last half year.
Sorrow is over.
Oh, how my heart beats free !
Here comes my drover —
With love for his Poss and me.
That was the old coo-ee-e ?
There ! Yes ! It’s he ! It’s he !!
Home comes my dear old lover,
How happy my life will be !
FFOLLIOTT.
MY TWO MATES.
Last trip my mate
Was bronzed and rough,
Stalwart; and straight,
And his voice was gruff;
He was not a beauty for looks,
But his heart was of sterling stuff.
Now, for all my trips
Shall my mate be fair ;
She has laughing lips,
She has shining hair,
She has eyes that are tender- and true,
Her voice is beyond compare,
And her heart is a womanly heart
Life’s troubles or joys to share.
My old mate has gone back to the West —
As a “ hatter ” henceforth he may roam ;
I shall follow his footsteps no more :
With my new mate I’m staying at home.

“ Twenty miles this side of Hay—
Rich in pasture, fat with sheep—
S’leetion that will always pay,
S’lection mortgageless and cheap ;
Rooted, cleared, and fenced around,
Sheds and stables all complete ;
Better squattin’ can’t be found
Than the farm at Gurrundeete.
“ Bestest soil for growin crops,
Rippin’ clover for the cows j
Juicy grass and thistle-tops,
Easy earth for decent ploughs ;
Not a rabbit you can trace,
Not a fox within a mile,
And I’ll throw in with the place
Splendid Ghost of Reuben Pyle.
“ ’Tween the bfankets (ain’t no sheet),
After graft in soakin’ grass
Icy cold about the feet,
Moon a-lookin’ through the glass.
Twelve ! the door creaks open wide :
Somethin’ white comes stalkin’ in,
White hands gropin’ at its side,
Hollow face, Hell’s eyes, sunk chin.
“ Blood is on its face of woe,
Bloody stains are on its gown ;
Blood is on its breast below,
Blood from fingers drippin’ down.
Plucky bloke wot doubts ’is eyes,
Thinks ’e dreams an’ tries to smile —
Better mind ! there ain’t no flies
On the Ghost of Reuben Pyle.
“ Want ter sell out soon as poss., i
Clear out for the Golden West;
Here’s a chance, so buy up, boss,
Say it’s done an’ let it rest.”

The question is being raised in Victoria as
to whether fortune-tellers, occupying mansions
and having big bank-balances, can be prosecuted
under the Police Offences Act as “ rogues and
vagabonds.” In England they probably could,
but certain words expressly referring to fortune-
tellers in the English act are omitted in the Vic-
torian.

Important Announcement by Dixson & Sons,
Tobacco Manufacturers.
The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Price MltliertO TJll“
known Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Yuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d. ! I— win at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “BONANZA”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note- —Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any
address on receipt of 10s. while this advertisement appears.

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1896.
The Victorian State Bank.
The State Bank Bill just introduced by the
Victorian Government and doomed, almost
as a matter of course, to be slaughtered later
on by the House of 48 Rich Landlords, is
another step in a weary political pilgrimage
to nowhere in particular. The Turner
Ministry has a big majority in the Lower
House, and a one-sided mandate from the
people to effect many much-needed reforms.
It really effects hardly any of them, because
the same people who gave it a strong demo-
cratic majority in the Assembly persistently,
through sheer stagnation and hopelessness
and want of interest, allow a solid Tory
phalanx to occupy the Legislative Council,
therefore one House has an active mandate
to do many things and the other a passive
one to leave them undone. The efforts of
the Govt, to pass progressive measures, under
conditions like these, are about as useless as
an attempt to dig holes in the sea, but with
a patience that passes all language it toils
along, hopelessly endeavoring to fulfil its
promises to the country which has left it so
miserably in the lurch. It spends as much
time and labor over perfecting the schemes
of reform that are certain to be dropped use-
lessly in the Council’s waste-paper basket on
arrival, as if they really had a fair chance of
becoming law, and carries water uphill in its
sieve with a laborious persistence that is
worthy of a better cause. And when it has
passed through the Assembly all the
great measures in its programme, and
the House of Landlords has squashed
them one by one, and there is nothing to
show after years of the hardest work which
any Victorian Government has yet attempted,
it will probably drop out of sight, and his-
tory will report that it was a failure because
it failed to do the things that the community
forced it to leave undone. Democratic legis-
lation in the Victorian Assembly nowadays
only serves two purposes : It affords the
Ministry the satisfaction of knowing that it
has done its duty so far as its power extends,
and thereby lifts a load off its own political
chest; and it compels the Council to take
the responsibility of publicly rejecting every
reform that the country most wants. And
■vhen the Council has done this four or five
hundred times, it is just possible that the
advertisement thus acquired will make it
smell so badly that Victoria will rise up and
fatally sand-bag that obstructive institution.
On the other hand, it is just equally possible
that Victoria will leave it alone as heretofore.
. * * •
The Turner Government’s State Bank
scheme is the most complete and perfect
thing of the kind yet proposed in these pro-
vinces. It contains all the best features of
the Maoriland and South Australian State
Banks and also of the proposed N.S.M. in-
stitution, and it tackles all the debateable
points of the question as boldly as if the
Ministry had a reliable majority in both
Chambers and its will was practically law.
Nothing appears to be left out merely as a
concession to Fat Man sentiment ; the pur-
pose seems to have been to construct the
most perfect scheme possible, to let the
Council reject it if it felt so inclined, and then
to let that institution and the nation which
created it take the responsibility of the
rejection. It provides, in the first place,
that the Post-office and the Commissioners’
Savings Banks shall be amalgamated, the
State guaranteeing all deposits and taking
over the management. The savings of the
people are to be invested, partly in mortgages
and partly in State and municipal securities,
and the system by which impecunious
Treasurers borrow them surreptitiously to
make good the deficit is to be put an end to.
The savings department will be one of four
separate branches into which the institution
is divided. The note-department is to be the
sole issuer of paper money in Victoria, and
the policy whereby a very large proportion
of the currency consists of the unsupported
lOU’s of almost anybody who chooses to go
into the business will be wholly abolished.
The State will guarantee payment of every
note in gold on presentation at the bank’s
head-office, and a reserve of gold and State
bonds will be held to fully cover the issue.
In case of another crisis the Government in-
stitution has power to issue State notes for a
practically unlimited amount to any private
bank, providing it deposits one-quarter of
their value in gold and three-quarters in
other approved securities, and in case the
securities thus pawned are insufficient
the State has a first lien on all the other
assets. This means that, in case of a sudden
run, the private bank has an institution at
hand which will advance money on all or any
of its tangible assets, and thereby turn them
all into liquid securities at once. Such a pro-
vision as this, in the ’93 crisis, would have
saved every Vic. bank, except perhaps the
Mercantile, Federal and City of Melbourne
which were dry-rotted past redemption, from
the disaster which overtook them, and the
great slump, and the burst, and the recon-
struction, and the ruinous 4J per cent, lia-
bility, and the awful depreciation of property,
and the locking-up of almost all the country’s
loose cash, and the widespread liquidation
and industrial paralysis, and at least half the
depression might have been averted. One
notable feature in the scheme is the proposal
to issue ten-shilling notes. This will save
much wear and tear of the coinage, which is
an expensive matter to replace, and looks
like an experiment that is worth trying.
• * ♦ *
The ordinary banking department of the
institution will keep the current account of
the Government, and of anyone else who
desires to put his cash in a place where it
will never be reconstructed or suspended or
liquidated or returned after much delay in
the shape of 7s. 6d. in the £. The surplus
moneys which it is not necessary to keep on
hand to meet actual requirements will be in-
vested in State and municipal securities
instead of being buried in long mortgages or
lent to the directors. The State Bank will
have a branch in London to manage the
public debt, thereby saving the heavy charges
now paid for that purpose. This accounts
for three departments. The fourth, and
probably the most important of all, is
to constitute a State Land Bank. It
will raise money by the sale, within the
province only, of bonds bearing not
more than 3J per cent, interest, and lend
on the security of country lands at per
cent. Money is to be advanced only on land
in actual use and yielding income ; advances
are limited to two-thirds the value, and, as
they are repayable by instalments, the
margin of security will be always increasing.
Also, as a guarantee against an accumulation
of arrears, any property on which the pay-
ments are two years in arrear is to be com-
pulsorily forfeited and realised upon. One-
half the surplus profits goes to a reserve fund
to provide for possible depreciation ; the
other half goes as a bonus to borrowers, con-
sequently, with inexpensive management, it
is just possible that the State Land Bank
will really provide money at 4j per cent.,
and the value of this boon to the farmer and
pastoralist who now pay 7 to 10 per cent,
will be something enormous.
* * • •
The management is hedged round with
elaborate precautions. Among other things,
it is provided that no bank or building
society director or officer is to have a hand
in the management of the State Bank, also
no uncertificated insolvent, or person who
has compounded with his creditors, or who
has been convicted of felony. The institu-
tion will be the receptacle for all unclaimed
moneys lying in private banks, and these, if
still unclaimed, will become the property of
the State. As in Canada, the private banks
will be required to hold 40 per cent, of their
local reserves in Government notes, which
will effectually prevent any combination
among them to keep State paper out of cir-
culation. The State Bank is to have branches
throughout the country, so that it will be a
national, and not merely a metropolitan, in-
stitution, and it will provide cheap money
for municipalities as well as for private bor-
rowers by making advances within certain
prescribed limits at a much lower rate oi in-
terest than the average country municipality
now has to pay. In fact, except for the one
matter that the bill does not at present give
power to lend money on town and city pro-
perty, it seems to deal with every possible
feature of the question, and if the /Victorian
State Bank should, by any possible chance
come into existence on the proposed hues, it
promises to be the most complete and best-
devised institution of its kind on earth.
* * * *
The chances for and against the success of
the measure are comparatively easy to sum
up. It will almost certainly be _ well-sup-
ported in the Assembly, which is mainly
democratic, and where the Turner Ministry
has vast influence. It will also be supported
by the agricultural and pastoral population
and by the owners of agricultural and pas-
toral lands, who want cheap money and who
are now charged, by banks and mortgage
companies and private usurers, far heavier
rates than city borrowers. Further, it will
be endorsed by investors who regard the
bonds of the Land Bank Department as a
safe and convenient investment, by some
business people who want to escape further
reconstruction of their balances, by country
municipal authorities who see a prospect of
cheaper loans than they can procure under
present conditions, by many people who are
not directly interested merely for the sake of
democratic principle and out of regard for
the best Ministry which Victoria has yet
possessed, and probably by those few mem-
bers of the Council who are not bank share-
holders or under the control of the banks,
and who have large areas of country lands
which the cheap-money scheme will materi-
ally benefit. On the other hand, it will be
bitterly opposed by the banks, their share-
holders, and all the people on whom they
can bring sufficient pressure, by finan-
ciers, loan and mortgage companies and
miscellaneous usurers, and by the Tory
party in general, excepting only that section
of it which would be directly benefited ; and
it will probably be viewed with comparative
indifference by a large section of the town
and city population, because they will gain
no immediate direct advantage, and will
probably fail to realise that the Land Bank
principle, if successfully applied in the
country, must ultimately be extended
throughout the province. In the Assembly
the success of the measure is almost certain.
In the Council its prospects depend almost
wholly on the relative strength of the country
landed interest on one hand, and the
banking, financial and city property interest
on the other, and also on the question
whether, even if the former should prove
stronger than is generally supposed, the
Upper House has not contracted a habit of
being against the Turner Government which
is now practically incurable. Among all
these chances the prospects of the measure in
the House of 48 Rich Landlords are far from
bright. Probably Premier Turner has little
hope of any good results just at present, and
merely goes on with his scheme out of his
laborous habit of doing his duty to the utter-
most, even though the heavens should fall.
And, so far, the heavens, whose name is
mostly Sargood, generally have fallen on
the indomitable Turner, and scattered his
carefully devised plans to the winds.
Why not Gamble?
There is no Democratic objection to gambling
as an amusement. There is no objection to
land occupation. There is objection to
monopoly. As betting is conducted in Aus-
tralia, there is a heavy impost levied on wagers
by the bookmakers, i.e., the prices are shorter
than they would be on a system of co-operative
gambling such as the tote. Life and Fire
Assurance companies, Stock Exchanges and
bookmakers are gambling agents who reap
enormous profits, or spend enormous amounts
in expenses, out of the money “ invested ” with
them. Insurance is a good thing—and Stock
Exchanges may serve a useful purpose. Bet-
ting on horses, as an amusement, affords
a great deal of pleasure to thousands
of people. Stockbrokers and bookmakers
bear relation to gambling, in analogy to the re-
lation of landlords to land. In the land drama
the landlord is the villain of the piece. In the
gambling drama, behold the bookmaker and
liis class. In the liquor trade, adulteration,
slow poison, tied houses, clumsy incidence of
taxation, and private enterprise reduce “ the
trade ” to a mere tout for the Devil of drunken-
ness. The supply aggravates the demand, in-
stead of the demand regulating the supply.
The State should be its own pub.-keeper, its
own land-monopolist, and its own bookmaker.
The tote doesn’t give credit, doesn’t stiffen
horses, doesn’t go insolvent, and doesn’t make
unfair wagers. Best of all, the tote doesn’t
tout for business.
* * ♦ *
Victoria, during the past 12 months, has had
several instances of pious persons and Chris-
tians in the worst sense of the term get ting up
to denounce gambling. The Leg. Council
(which is excessively pious) had the Streets
Betting Suppression Bill before it for six
weeks, and spent days in prayerful considera-
tion of its clauses, lest by chance Caulfield
racecourse (which is near a street) should be
accidentally included in its provisions. Soli-
citor-General Cuthbert’s speech in advocating
the measure contained only one argument, viz. ,
that many young fellows stole postage-stamps
from their employers and used the proceeds in
betting. A Supreme Court Judge, lecturing at
a “ Pleasant ” Sunday Afternoon, said that
wagering a shilling was analogous to two per-
sons deciding by lot which of the two should
make a small wound in the other with a knife.
On the other hand, a game of tennis for love
left a noble exhilaration to the victor without
pain to the loser. Then Rev. Marshall, of
Scots’ Church, has a word to say :
“ Nor would anyone but the most uncompromising
Puritan condemn as a deadly sin the little friendly wager,
which is but a counter or souvenir of one’s interest in the
day.”
Then he goes on to condemn Cup-day, as a day
“ Memorable for life-long sorrows and regrets, for
blasted hopes, for ruined reputations, for suicidal despair.”
Last November also, one Meiklejohn howled
in the Presbyterian Assembly :
“ An essential element in gambling is the selfishness of
the motive, and that is absent in the case of church
raffles. Raffling is more like a subscription sale than like
betting or sweeps. The element of chance is present, but
that is not the main element.
A Castlemaihe (Vic.) parson, who objected to
raffles, introduced an e' asion of the principle
to his bazaars. He dec ee i that all buyers of
tickets shall get a prize—but there is one prin-
cipal prize to be “ raffled for.” Everybody else
gets a cheap lolly wrapped in tissue paper.
* * * *
These instances show how the pious person
argues the subject of gambling, and how he
evades the issue. That historical tornado,
Talmage, once preached a splendid sermon on
life-assurance, indicating that a Christian should
not only have his soul saved but his life
assured. What is a life-policy but a tote-
ticket ? Fire insurance is a more flagrant case,
and marine insurance is one of the biggest
gambles in the world. London Lloyd’s is only
a common gaming-house, legalised. There they
will insure a race-meeting against rain. They
will insure a man against his wife having twins.
They will even insure a collier leaving New-
castle, N.S.W.

ing Notions.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Those “ Disastrous Effects.”
The man who writes the Sydney Telegraph
articles on the “ Disastrous Effects of Protec-
tion in Victoria ” has a truly fearsome capacity
for giving himself and his cause away, and
when he has done this rather more violently
than usual, he raises three cheers and says that
his argument is now conclusively established.
In the last Saturday’s instalment of his tale of
woe he advanced two sets of figures, both of
which, by his own showing, severely bashed
Freetrade on the head, and he proudly asked
the community to look at them and see how
clear the whole affair was. The first one read
as follows :
There are two phenomena by which the comparative
material condition of the people of these colonies can be
measured more accurately than by any other. The one is
the marriage and birth rate, the other is the consumption,
per head of the population, of the necessaries and simple
luxuries of life. In Great Britain, as well as in these
colonies, it has been found that every improvement in the
condition of the masses of the people is at once followed
by an increase in the rate of marriages and births, and by
an increase in consumption; that every disturbance of
trade and industry resulting in scarcity of employment
and lower wages, is at once reflected by a reduction in
both these respects. If then, we find that in one colony
the birth and marriage rates and also the rate of con-
sumption are uniformly slower than in the other, we are
quite certain that the material condition of its people is
worse, and the difference between the rates gives us at
least an approximate measure of how much it is worse.
MARRIAGE AND BIRTH RATE PER 1000 OF POPU-
LATION.
The table is perfectly correct; and it proves
exactly the opposite of what the Telegraph’s
maddened correspondent alleges. Up to 1871
both provinces followed Freetrade, therefore
the fact that the Victorian marriage rate
was 1*39 and its birth rate 3"28 per 1000
behind that of N.S. Wales has nothing to
do with the fiscal controversy. Then Vic-
toria went in for Protection, and now its
marriage-rate is only .27 and its birth-rate 2.10
behind. In other words, the gap has lessened
immensely, and Victoria under Protection isn’t
nearly so far behind as was the same province
under Freetrade. The rates have diminished
in both provinces—but in the Freetrade pro-
vince they have diminished almost twice as
fast. Having thus put both feet in his mouth,
the Telegraph man proceeds to show that the
country which consumes most victuals per head
of population is the most prosperous, and heaves
this other "table at the head of a distracted
community :
CONSUMPTION OF FOOD, 1894.
This adds up to show that the Cornstalk gets
through 10311 b. of provisions per annum, while
the Victorian uses 10251 b., but if the two
articles—salt and tobacco—which are hardly
solid victuals are left out, the Victorian is
distinctly ahead. But the Telegraph man
doesn’t add them up. He simply remarks
that :
These two facts, the higher rate of consumption and of
marriages and births, show to demonstration that the
protective policy of Victoria has been a curse to its people ;
that it has wrecked the lives and the prospects of thou-
sands of human beings, condemning them to a state of
celibacy, and depriving them of the joys and elevating


influences of family life, and that it has carried want and
deprivation into innumerable homes.
Great Scott ! ! 1

The National Ass in Reply.
Mr. William Epps, secretary of the N.S.W.
Ass, writes as follows :
In a recent issue you criticised at some length the an-
tagonistic attitude taken by Liberty, the journal of the
Australasian National League (N.S.W. section), upon the
old-age pension scheme of the N.S.W. Parliamentary
committee. Permit me to say that your article is one of
the most remarkable pieces of logic I have seen —even in
The Bulletin. Apparently you have come at last to
recognise that there is something in “ thrift ” —at which
you have so frequently railed —and which you explain
“ consists largely in the individual putting away money
to support him in his old age.” The chief merit of the
scheme, in your eyes, appears to be that this thrift will be
exercised by individuals putting their “ savings in charge
of the State, where there seems to be reason to believe
they will be moderately safe,” and getting them back in
the form of pensions. I have looked up the scheme of
the committee as proposed, and find it to be roughly as
follows :—Every person over 60 years of age, who has been
15 years in the colony and has an income of less than £SO
a year, is to receive a pension of 10s. a week, and married
couples of 15s. a week. The money assumed to be neces-
sary for this proposal is to come from the following
sources: £35,000 from a tax on totalisators ; £BOOO
from billiard-licenses ; £6OOO from fines for drunkenness ;
£BOOO from a tax on sports and entertainments ; £22,000
from the customs taxation on wines, spirits, tobacco, &c. ;
and £II,OOO from a saving in the cost of charitable insti-
tutions. So your idea is that the best means of inculcat-
ing “thrift” is to get people to put their money into
totes, billiards, unlimited 3d. drinks (please explain
whether you mean long or short ones), athletic sports,
and drinks again, or tobacco. That is what you describe
as putting one’s “ savings in charge of the State.” Ergo,
the more you swamp in those forms of saving, the better
off you will be. May I, before concluding, suggest that
your ancient joke upon the former title of this organisa-
tion is becoming a trifle thin and threadbare. I think it
is now nearly five years old, and originally it was cribbed.
In reply to which The Bulletin cheerfully
admits that it has called the National Ass an
Ass for five years or even longer, and the name
is getting monotonous. Still it isn’t half so
monotonous as the fact that the National Ass
has been a National Ass for five years or more,
and as long as it continues to be an Ass this
paper must call it one merely for want of a
better name. For the rest, The Bulletin pre-
sumes that Thrift (not a vote for Thrift) is a
good thing—the National Ass organ has said it
so often that it is too late for it to go back on its
own statement now. And if the community
decides to tax its own luxuries—its own beer
and billiards and gambling, and other things—
in order to provide for its own old age, then it
compels itself to pay more for them and puts
away the difference, and if that isn’t the beauti-
ful virtue of Thrift in its most aggravated form
—what is it? Mr. Epps seems to hold that tax-
ing beer for a good purpose is not Thrift; does
he therefore mean that Thrift consists in not
taxing beer ?
The Pension Disease.
Among 380 existing pensioners on the Vic.
Civil Service there are 96 who draw £47,230
per annum, giving an average of £492. This is
a mild scandal compared with the state of
affairs in N.S.W., but a recent exposure of the
aforesaid figures in Vic. Assembly should en-
able the Democratic members to demand a
reasonable reconstruction of pension principles.
The Civil Service system, under which a big
salary entails a proportionately big pension
when the employb ceases to pick his teeth in
the office, and retires to pick his teeth else-
where—in England frequently—is a Fat Man
system which cannot be honestly defended.
Presuming that each fellow in receipt of a high
salary is worth it (which, as a rule, he isn’t),
and that he earns his .£IOOO a year quite as
fully as another civil servant earns his maxi-
mum reward of £3OO a year, then the
difference between the values of their
respective labors is properly recognised
during their working lives, and they should be
considered to quit the service on equal terms.
The superior brains and industry of the better
servant have achieved for him the better
chance to accumulate capital in his business at
the Government office, and when he knocks off
work at the age of 55 or 60, he deserves exactly
the same amount of pension as the £3OO a year
man who retires with him. Besides, no worker,
of any description, can show just cause for ask-
ing a handsome pension from the source which
has yielded him liberal and steadily increasing
salary for 30 years. The argument that his
high wages have “elevated him in the social
scale ” and made him an expensive person to
keep going, and that, therefore, he needs a
high pension to save him from comparative
ruin, is the very hollowest of Fat Men argu-
ments, and it is only fair to Fat Man to state
that he never supports it in practice in his own
private business. His old employes are not
requested to retire on two-thirds pay at the age
of 60 or anything of that sort. Intense grati-
tude for former services is almost peculiar to
the Civil Service and joint stock companies,
where the authorities who ordain the pensions
are dealing with other people’s coin.
Nervous Diseases Wanted, an Expert.
“ Medicus ” to The Bulletin :
While specialists in various branches of medicine and
surgery are thick as totes in Sydney, many of them eking
out a bare existence, the fact remains that there is no
really first-class man in the province who makes nervous
diseases his speciality. It was only happy chance that
Bent us a Chambers ; when will another such chance send
ns a Da Costa, a Hammond, or a Ranney ? The time is
ripe for the appearance of a really good man of experience
in the diagnosis and treatment of the most distressing
class of diseases that affect mankind. At the present
time, when a person who has evinced symptoms of some
mental affection is hauled up before the average doctor
for examination, the chances are about six in ten that, no
matter what the origin of the trouble or peculiarity of
its manifestation, the diagnosis will be “Incipient G.P.”
(general paralysis), and “ He’s in the asylum now” will be
the song of the afflicted one’s relatives thereafter. It is a
fact, however, that there are an appalling number of cases
of general paralysis in the N.S.W. asylums, the young and
well-nourished being the more frequent victims. It is
further to be noted that while whites of all ages and con-
ditions—laborers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, &c. —are
such frequent victims to this disease, yet Dr. Blaxland,
of Callan Park, asserts that in 15 years’ experience in
Govt, asvlums of all the Chinese that have come under
his observations only four have had g.p. As all Chinese
are supposed to be opium-smokers, this statement fur-
nishes food for reflection. Many of those affected by g.p.
are as happy as larks on account of the imaginary posses-
sion of wealth “ beyond the dreams of avarice,” while
many others are in direct communication with the
Throne, and are hourly receiving marked evidences
of royal favour. One assertion the writer desires
to make with a loud voice is that the custom
in vogue here of incarcerating epileptics in insane
asylums is an accursed outrage and a relio of barbarism.
It would be just as sensible to send
with toothache or a young woman with Jitusd
£ V M«*S epi'psy. The .-at -jority of
indeed, and even during the attaok the patient is unawa
of his condition simply because he is unoonscicms. n t
mad. However, an epileptic is like Proverbial Irs .
man’s flea in that you never know when you have Him,
hence relations get tired of the eternal vigilance 'pessary
for safety, and the poor devil is W “
insane asylum to fret away his Me. Far betterM
him right away. One peculiarity observed bj
doctors and attendants is the marked partiality
shown by epileptics for each others society.
On the admission of a fresh patient the old hands
afflicted with the disease make friendly overtures to him,
and for hours they wander about together, chatting in tne
most chummy manner and avoiding the other patients.
What is wanted is a separate institution with a staff
skilled by latest modern teaching in the diagnosing and
treatment of this class of cases ; and while certain MsP.
are on their feet yelling for justice for the leper, they
might well point out to this Govt, that a few thousands
spent in the above direction will be of far greater benefit
to the country than in erecting unnecessary Parliamen-
tary buildings or promoting wild-cat exhibitions. As in
all branches of medicine and surgery there have been
“ fashions ” in the treatment of epilepsy, but always the
faculty have been compelled to fall back on the old prac-
tice of using bromides —which, while unsatisfactory, is the
best treatment yet devised. This practice is followed out
here, a favorite stock prescription being a combination of
potassium bromide, magnesia sulphate, and cannabis
indica ; this latter drug being, in the writer’s opinion, of
no more value in epilepsy than two whoops in a 10-acre
paddock. However, it imparts a nice color to the mix-
ture, so in she goes. Medical men of the U.S. are follow-
ing with great interest the experiments being conducted
by Dr. H. C. Rutter, of the State Epileptic Hospital at
Gallipolis, Ohio, in the treatment of the disease, and it is
believed that the result of his investigations may greatly
alter present methods. What the writer would like to
see legalised is the use of the surgeon’s knife on the man
who, with a family history showing epilepsy, attempts to
marry and thus probably burden the State with a brood
of strumous idiots. Let us, meanwhile, have a hospital
for epileptics, and let us have it quickly.
The Jew-all Vote.
Vic. Tories have a novel substitute for one-man-
one-vote, evolved out of the turmoil when
Patterson got the unanimous foot of his coun-
try on his chest. It is the dual, jew-all vote—
made up by giving a vote for manhood and a
vote for landownership. The idea is that the
landowner has “ linked his fortunes with the
country,” and is not a floating atom —a bird of
passage. The example of the well-advertised
big landowner who skipped to Colombo and
had to be brought back under police protection
is not quoted. Nor is the case of the other
landboomers now cooling their heels in foreign
parts. It is the unfortunate victim of the land-
lord that is tied to the country, because, even
if he would, he has not the money to pay his
fare out of it. Another argument is that the
land-owner is prima-facie more able to exercise
the suffrage, and therefore ought to have double
suffrage. In a duel with swords a man with
long arms would prima-facie have an advantage
in the fight, therefore he ought to have a longer
sword than his opponent ! In every day fact,
the man of property has personal influence that
is politically as good as one or many votes to
him—and to add to his power is to grease the
fat pig. M'Kenzie has a scheme to help the
“capitalist who could not get the thrift-vote
through having no real property.” M‘Kenzie
would extend the vote to those who pay
income-tax. Under this system Jesus Christ
might get one vote (it would be pointed out,
however, that He was only a tramp, a bird of
passage, a floating atom) while Judas Iscariot
would get the jew-all vote, on account of the
thirty pieces of silver and what he embezzled
from the bag. The jew-all vote is a cynical
piece of impudence. Already the landowners
hold the Government of Vic. in an octopus-grip,
by means of the Leg. Council’s 48 Rich Land-
lords—-and the idea that the Tories will be
allowed to further entrench themselves is one of
those jokes that lie too deep for laughter.
“ Not Before Pa.”
The present N.S.W. Chief Justice, when at the
Bar, had no great reputation as a humorist;
but he did say one good thing—and let us
hope it was original. On one occasion,
when appearing before Mr. Justice Manning,
the Judge’s son was opposed to him. ■ Mr.
Darley, finding the Judge not at all inclined
to agree with his argument, remarked that he
had a difficult case to fight, as the Judge was
against him, and “ to add to his difficulties the
son was in his eyes.” The old Judge has gone
to his rest, and a new Judge sits in his seat;
but still suitors in the Equity Court often think
that the son, if not in their eyes, is at any rate
in their way. When the Judge’s - relatives
question was raised, it was usually considered to
be a hit at the family and relatives of Mr. Win-
deyer. Ex-Judge Windeyer was not the sole
or the worst offender, for he sat only a few
months of the year in Divorce, and his clan
only practised in the Divorce Court. The
Equity Court, however, sits all the year round,
and the objectionable system of a son practising
before his father and appearing on one side or
the other is there in full swing. The position
the son referred to has attained at the
Bar, to which he was admitted in 1888,
makes one suspect that his admitted merit
has not been the only factor in his
success. This undoubtedly able young gentle-
man has many advantages over the com-
mon or garden variety of barrister. It may
happen that sonny will argue before dad up to
lunch-time, go to lunch with him, and then
renew his argument at two o’clock. There
may be absolutely nothing in this, but the
public will think there is. The Equity
crowd are all “ English, quite English, you
know,” and, of course, for manners as well
as precedents, look to England. It is a great
pity they do not insist on the adoption of the
English rule forbidding sons to practise before
their fathers. The only (sitting) N.S. Wales
Judge who has done this is an Australian—Judge
Simpson.
The Bitter Cry of the British Manu-
facturer.
It is some time since The Bulletin alluded to
the circular of Bryant and May which speaks
of the £400,000 worth of foreign matches bought
by England, while workless thousands clamor
outside London factories. The Australasian
[Free] Trade Review now takes up the par-
able in the following fashion :
As far as matches are concerned, the whole question
may he disposed of in a few words. Those Britons who
can afford to buy the more expensive matches of Bryant
and May should, as a matter of charity, do so, in order
that a number of poor fellow-countrymen and women
may be kept in employment at fair wages. But, if the
methods of making matches in England cannot be
cheapened so as to meet the foreign competition, then the
industry will inevitably languish, and a more profitable
employment may be found for the labor and the capital
employed.
Firstly, the Freetrade journal asserts that
voluntary “ Protection ” should be given by the
charitable to an industry that is “ not self-
supporting” (to use the lingo of the cult).
Secondly, the industry must languish because
it is “not self-supporting”—and profitable
employment may be found for the workless
thousands. As to firstly: “Protection” is
held to be a righteous thing for charitable per-
sons—but, by hypothesis, it is a wicked thing
for a nation of “charitable persons.” As
to secondly : In the absence of “if” employ-
ment may be found, but it isn’t. The workless
thousands standing in London streets are
starving for an economic principle. “Employ-
ment may be found.” While the grass grows
the steed starves—a proverb that has got a
little more than musty since Hamlet referred
to it, and which is a hopeless answer to the
bitter cry of the British manufacturer.
The pastoral industry is almost the beginning,
middle, and end of Australia’s wealth. Ac-
cording to Coghlan’s “ Seven Colonies,” 84,000
people engaged in pastoral and dairying pur-
suits produce by means of the sheep and the
cow £46,000,000 a year, or £548 each. In
agriculture, 310,000 people produce £16,000,000
a year, or about £52 each. In the mining busi-
ness, 94,000 people dig and blast and smelt out
£13,400,000 worth of wealth per annum, or
£143 each ; and in manufactures 257,000 people
turn out something like £25,000,000 worth of
work, or about £IOO worth each per annum.
Thus the pastoral business brings into the
country about four times as much cash in pro-
portion to the number of persons engaged in it
as the very best of the other great industries.
And herein lies the secret of the prosperity of
Queensland and New South Wales. By
virtue of their good soil, and great area, and
comparative abundance of water, they
carry almost twice as much sheep and
cow in proportion to their population as
Westralia, S.A., Tasmania, or Victoria, and
the sheep and the cow are almost the only Aus-
tralian industry which does more than pay
expenses. Even mining, which is distinctly
the next best, doesn’t begin to be a patch on
the great jumbuck occupation. The fact that
the pastoral worker is hardly any, if any,
better paid than the miner doesn’t affect the
argument: the point that sticks out conspicu-
ously is that Australia is a comparatively rich
country with many Fat Men in it, not through
the genius of its inhabitants, who make a
remarkably moderate show in every other line
of business, but because it is large and empty,
and has plenty of elbow-room for the sheep and
the cow, and a climate which agrees with these
animals. And when Australia becomes thickly
inhabited, so that there isn’t nearly so much
sheep and cow in proportion to population as at
present, it promises to become a very ordinary
place indeed.
Melbourne Australasian does a fresh howl
about the person with proputty and a plural
vote who “ helped to build up the country ” :
The Assembly is asked to affirm that, for purposes of
legislation, the man who has no appreciable interest in
the stability of the colony is as good as anybody else.
“To say,” as Mr. M'Kenzie remarked on Tuesday even-
ing, “that a man who had come to this country, had
helped to build it up to its present condition—linked his
fortunes with the country so that he must sink or swim
with it —was to be placed on the same level as one who
had no interest in it except what he could get out of it—a
bird of passage —a floating atom —was absurd.”
Isn’t it about time this inverted wheeze about
the man of property being bound to the country
while the man without property can leave it at
any time, was put right end up ? Australasia
is surrounded by sea; the penniless man can’t
walk out of it, and about the lowest price at
which he can get out without walking is £ls if
he is single—something like £SO if he is married
and has a family. Not having the requisite
sum he can’t get out; he must sink or swim
with the country, and he has more interest in
its stability than any one else. The plural
vote man, if the state of the country doesn’t
please him, simply realises his wealth, takes a
bank draft and a saloon passage, and goes to
London to be a “representative Australian”
for ever afterwards. He is the real bird of
passage —the man who hasn’t a stake in the
country and doesn’t need to care a straw how it
is managed because he can, and does, get out of
it as often and as much as he pleases.
And why is there so much damp pathos about
“ the man who has come to this country and
helped to build it up ? ” Isn’t the man who was
born in the country and helped to build it
up worth a moment’s consideration ? And
what about the man who came to the country
and helped to pull it down ? Also, is there no
consideration due to the man who came to the
country or was born in it, and who found the
country falling down when he arrived, and in-
stead of building, which wasn’t wanted at the
time, devoted himself to holding up the re-
mains so as to keep them from crumbling any
worse ? Building up isn’t everything ; when
the building is shoddy the man who erects it
in the first place has a far lighter job than the
one who holds it up afterwards.
There is another outbreak of complaint re the
“ blackmailing ” practised upon unwary turtle-
doves who coo and cuddle in Hyde Park,
London. The parks, which ought to be the
most decent of “ spooning ” resorts, are infested
by creeping rascals who threaten charges of
“improper behaviour” against any unhappy
pair they can strike terror into. Newspapers
artlessly remark that the police, although con-
stantly informed of blackmail cases, do nothing
to suppress the 'evil. Not likely. The police
everywhere—in Australia as well as abroad—
are the root of all such evil; the creeping
rascals are, in many cases, their agents working
for a share of the plunder. They themselves
(that is to say, the rascally portion of them)
blackmail in person when it seems quite safe,
and, anyway, how could the threats of the
other fellow carry any weight but for official
co-operation ? A park loafer can’t take
Edwin and Angelina into custody. Ha
threatens to “ report them,” which is just
what he wouldn’t dare to do if the lurk-
ing myrmidons of the law were sternly
instructed to clear the park of black-
mailers. In fact, he wouldn’t be there at all if
the men in blue didn’t want him, neither would
prostitutes be there if they were not privately
licensed by the underpaid constables who levy
taxes on their miserable earnings. Policemen,
in the first place, don’t get enough money from
the Government to keep them free from dirty
dealings, and, in the next place, their occupa-
tion is demoralising in its Paul Pryish tenden-
cies. Upon the night - shaded endearments
which no considerate citizen would willingly
disturb, peeler Mickey is naturally disposed to
turn his bull’s-eye lantern.

That aggregation of Fatmen, Melb. Harbor
Trust, lately decided by 10 votes to 6 to
cast out Commissioner Treganowan’s motion
favoring a revision of the wages-system of its
employes. It was pointed out logically enough
that since the last revision in ’94 a number of
increases had been granted, in many instances
creating two scales of payment for the same
work. “ Either one lot of men are getting too
much or the other too little,” aptly observed
one of the members. But the majority would
have none of logic, nor would it admit that the
workman of Melb. to-day is in a better posi-
tion than he was two years ago —a fact obvious
to the most cursory observer. It simply
chucked out the resolution, and when it was
pointed out that some of its employes received
£7 per month for working hours a week,
its view of the question was neatly voiced by a
commissioner, who humanely remarked : “ If
the Trust were to dismiss all the men who are
dissatisfied with their position, it could get
hundreds of others ready to take their places,
and I think it would be a very good lesson for
them. It would teach them not to be per-
petually harassing the Trust to increase their
wages.” And of such is the kingdom of
Capital !
King O’Malley, the glorified Yankee bagman
of S.A. Assembly, has carried his Bill for the
abolition of barmaids. The new order of things
is to date from the beginning of 1899, so as to
allow time for the present race of Flossies to
die out. After that, only the Mrs. Publicaness
or the daughters, wives, or other female rela-
tions of publicans are to be allowed behind the
bar. Therefore, The Bulletin presumes that
some of the Flossies will set up on their own
account, and some will marry the publican and
qualify that way, and the rest will mostly be
the publican’s female relative. Any publican
of brains can arrange a few birth-certificates
showing that he has six younger sisters, and
get them to serve in succession ; and even if he
has only one sister, and she seems to be different
every few months, it probably won’t matter
much. The moral of the new law seems to be
that the bar is a place where girls get corrupted,
but it doesn’t matter whether a publican’s
woman-relatives are corrupted or not; also that
because the barmaid is a bad lot the publican
ought to marry her. The next 2J years will
probably be spent partly in marrying the beer-
Flossie, partly in teaching her to call the
publican “ pa,” and partly in hunting up bar-
maids who are sufficiently like the old man to
pass for some kind of relatives, and teaching
them the family history, so that the twin
daughters won’t be born too far apart and with
more than five years discrepancy in the date.
The results should be interesting.

Interesting slab from the speeeh-in-defence of
John Norton, tried at Sydney for alleged
sedition: —
This is not the first time the liberty of speech has been
in jeopardy in this colony. You will recollect, and I have
here a copy of the Treason Felony Act of 1868, when,
owing to the excitement of the foolish act of a drunken,
mad Irishman, in firing a shot at the Duke of Edinburgh
down at Clontarf, public opinion became excited, and
there were rumors of a conspiracy. During that panic,
which was similar to the Loyal Jubilee Demonstration of
10 years ago, this Treason Felony Act was passed. This
Act made it treason felony to refuse to drink the health
of the Queen when called upon to do so. It was passed
under the same inspiration of the so-called spirit of
l 03 r alty which is now prompting this prosecution. Clause
9 of that remarkable piece of legislation known as “31 Vic.,
No. 25, entituled an Act for the Better Security of the
Crown and Government of the United Kingdom and for
the Better Suppression and Punishment of Seditious
Practices and Attempts,” assented to March 18,1868 :
“ If any person shall use any language disrespectful to
Her Majesty the Queen, or shall factiously avow a deter-
mination to refuse to join in any loyal toast or demon-
stration in honor of Her Majesty, or shall by word or deed
express sympathy with the crime of any persons said to
or suspected to be or to have been engaged in the com-
mission of or in the attempt to commit any felony, or
shall hold out byword or deed as worthy of praise ... he
shall be liable to two years’ imprisonment with hard
labor.”
Imagine the consequences of refusing to join in a toast.
For instance, a man might go into a bar and be met by a
half-drunken man with a demand to drink the toast of
the Queen. This was the sort of thing that was possible
in this colony in 1868, and it happened that a man was
committed for trial under the very circumstances I am
pointing out. At Goulburn, a party of young men were
drinking in a public-house, and an obstreperous party-
man entered the bar and demanded that they should
drink the health of the Queen. One of the young men, in
a half-drunken condition, resented the impertinence of
this stranger, and said, “the Queen be damned ; I will
drink your mother’s health or mine, but I won’t
drink to the Queen.” Would you believe it, he
was indicted for treason - felony, and if it had
not been for a curious circunit'ance he would
have been convicted. The Hon. W. B. Dalley was re-
tained at a fee of £2OO to defend him, but, owing, I
believe, to the mercifulness of the Attorney-General of the
day, nobody had a copy of the statute when the case
came on for trial, and so the thing fell through. As soon
as Mr. Dalley appeared to defend the young man he
asked his Honor, the Judge who was presiding’ to allow
him to see a copy of the Act. The Judge did not have
one, the Crown did not have one, and no trace of one
could be found in the court. In this way the case was
abandoned. You will see from that what loyalty can come
to in this colony. That is the sort of thing that can be
done under the sentiment of loyalty.
An unreported incident of the jingo
“ Trafalgar ” meeting at Melbourne Town Hall.
Just as Gov. Brassey was acknowledging the
plaudits of the propertied and warlike classes,
agitator Fleming roared from the body of the hall
—“ Three cheers for France, Liberty, Equality,
and Fraternity ! Down with the aristocracy ! ”
Whereupon the instruments of law’norder ran out
Fleming, who -told them that he was bound to go
anyway, because he had another meeting to
attend. The fact that his presence is required
elsewhere must be very consoling to a man who
happens to have the policemen pushing him off
the premises.

The last production of the Bland Holt
season at Sydney Royal, “In Sight of St. Paul’s,”
is a disconnected and fragmentary thing, in which
nething leads to anything in particular. The
splendid staging and the dramatic force of'a strong
company, and the occasional strong situations,
save it from being what it deserves to be, and pre-
vent the audience rising unanimously and consign-
ing the author to the place that he ought to go to;
but, all the same, “ St. Paul’s ” is as disconnected
as a dynamited Czar, and scrappy to the verge of
desperation. It opens with a happy family—
father, sister,. a pretty she-cousin, and two
brothers a wicked captain, and a siren. One
brother, being infatuated with the siren, forges
his father s name on a bill which the wicked cap-
tain holds, and the other one, to save him, says he
did it. Then the latter goes away to toil in
obscurity, and nothing comes of his obscurity save
that the matter is cleared up, and he returns.
Later on, .he hunts up the bad brother, who is
still following the siren with a hang-dog look on
his face and a tall hat, and, while the two are
remonstrating, the captain shoots the bad brother
for no reason that transpires then or afterwards.
The siren kidnaps the pretty girl-cousin, and locks
her up in her den of gilded infamy, and then does
nothing special, except urge her to have a glass of
wine. There is a scene outside St. Paul’s, where
two .women and a child are looking at a flag and
talking about a dead soldier, and the elder woman
discovers that the others are her daughter-in-law
and grandchild, and they become reconciled and
go away together. These ladies aren’t in the
story, and their episode has nothing to do with
anybody. Finally, the wicked captain states that
if the worst comes he will suicide, but, when the
worst does come, he drops his bottle of poison
twice on the pavement, and is finally left leaning
against a wall unsuicided, and seemingly as fresh
as ever.
♦ * * *
There are other aggravating features in the
business. The heart of the audience goes out to
Miss Yirgie Vivienne, as a bright and kindly
lady of very, shady 'character, who shoots the
siren ; and it wants badly to know if she was
gaoled for it and had her lovely hair cut off, or
was hanged and had her snow-white shoulders
pawed by Nosey Bob, or if she reformed, or what?
None of these matters are cleared up. Also, it
wants to know what the thing is all about'in
general. The co. tackles the matter in an ener-
getic spirit; Miss Frances Ross looks her prettiest
and plays admirably as the angelic heroine, and
Miss Watson’s siren is a fine piece of work ; also
Baker, Norman, Charles Brown, and Mr. and
Mrs. Bland Holt all call for a lot of praise—still
the reason why so many of these people simply
walk over the edge of the tale and are never
again accounted for isn’t so clear as it might be.
Ihe conflagration in which the siren gets con-
siderably charred—she afterwards dies in the
hospital is a beautiful piece of combustion, and
a view of London in Act 1 is really excellent, and
these are the best things that can be said for the
drama. Otherwise it is illuminated hash, with
irrelevant people dropping in at times and making
remarks about Hingland’s greatness, and obscur-
ing the view of the sinful captain who ought to be
convulsed by strychnine in the corner, but isn’t.
Also there are sundry thrilling episodes—notably
the trial of the good brother, and the death of the
charred siren—which don’t appear at all. Some-
one simply drops in now and then and mentions
them, while a lot of things which might as well be
dropped in and mentioned are set out at full
length.
** * *
Her Majesty’s (Sydney), which is generally
more or less under a cloud, is having a vigorous
boom on the strength of a new melodrama
described as “ The Serpent’s Coil.” Said boom is
thoroughly well deserved. The horror-drama
like everything else, is worth doing well and to the
uttermost, and “ Tne Serpent’s Coil ” breaks every
record that The Bulletin knows of in the matter
of horror and blood-shriek and premeditated
butchery. It rages promiscuously in England
Italy and Pekin, and gibbers after gore all over
the globe. It is the embodiment of all the penny
dreadfuls on earth set to slow music ; also, it con-
tains about the most rampant villain who has
appeared up to date, and includes a steamboat on
the Bay of Naples and a boa-constrictor in China
and almost everything else. In the very first act
the bad man of the story induces his enemy to lean
against an electric machine, whereupon a huge
globe of fire strikes him dead with a sudden “ pff ”
and “ whoosh,” and his singed remains fall back
in a heap. I hereafter there is a burglary and an
attempted poisoning, and after that the story
branches off into new tracks of blood and bones
ai jd raw meat, and howls soulfully in the region
where the kraken and the literary squid have
their haunt. The bid man attempts to fry his
beautiful young wife alive in an oven, but after
telling her how she will linger and wail and
crackle, and how her hair will blaze up, he par-
tially relents, and doesn’t fry her after all, and
the proposed crackle never comes off. Instead
he merely leaves the shrieking girl alone with a
large green boa-constrictor. His last words as he
goes out are to the effect that she will be gradu-
ally squeezed, and the serpent will probably break
her legs a good deal before he slimes her all over
and svvallows her, and that the operation will
most likely take some time. Thereafter the play
becomes comparatively calm, and there is nothing-
in it but a Chinese riot and a blazing house, and
about two dozen miscellaneous fights, and a suicide
by the electric apparatus, and the arrest of almost
everybody with almost everybody else waving a
revolver and threatening to shoot the world in
general.
* * * *
There is no literary merit at all in the
“Serpent’s Coil,” and the company is mostly a
dead level, and a tolerably depressed level at that.
There is something to be said for Miss Daisy
Holly, who is a pretty and agile dancer, and Miss
Maud Lita is an exception to the general ordi-
nariness of things. Also William Cosgrove, as
the very worst bad man—one who could give
Sodom and Gomorrah 50 yards in 100 and
win easily—can’t be overlooked, partly because
his dialogue consists so very largely of “curse”
and “damn,” and partly because he owns the
green boa-constrictor. But, in a general way, and
apart from the scenic effects, the “Serpent’s
Coil ” travels on its blood-squashiness and its
singed corpse. Even when the bad man threatens
to pound his bride an hour after marriage, nobody
notices it, and the curses he heaps upon her, and
the way the corpse bobs up and down when he is
dragging it away after showing it to her, and
other small unpleasantnesses, pass unobserved
in the general confusion. In fact, even if the
depraved person of the story came in swinging a
freshly-amputated leg in his hand he would hardly
draw much attention, unless he whacked the leg
on the table very furiously indeed. After two acts
of the ‘ ‘ Serpent’s Coil ” the audience becomes
hardened, and is capable of looking on calmly
while boiling water is poured over its mother.
One anomaly, by the way, is that the serpent
doesn’t coil worth a cent. That bright green
animal only appears once and then it is straight.

The Nat Goodwin season at Sydney Lyceum
ended on Saturday night, when the American
comedian _ delivered his farewell speech, partly
through his nose, and said more kind things about
the people of Australia than were altogether de-
served. It was a neat little speech, and if the
orator had taken off and wiped a celluloid collar
as he spoke it would have suggested the Missouri
sheriff in every line. After hearing Nat in his
own private capacity the general impression is
that the sheriff is more like the real Goodwin than
any of his other characters. This last night was
made an American festival; the stars and stripes
pervaded the building, and nearly everybody had
an initial in the middle of his name and a ten-
dency to go out and have a cocktail in the inter-
vals. Now that Goodwin has departed the Lyceum
will suffer a week’s desolation, broken only by the
cries of an amateur opera co. which wrestles with
“ Maritana ” on Wednesday and Thursday under
Y.R. and other influential patronage, and
is sure to have big houses. On Satur-
day, however, the Potter-Bellew co. comes back
to play “She Stoops to Conquer,” and “Romeo
and Juliet ” follows later on.

Coleman and. Alice Leamar are back at
Sydney Tivoli for the several hundredth time,
and that house is booming with the same old boom
which never seems to abandon Harry Rickards
now-a-days. The rival house, Adams’ Palace of
Varieties, is now announced to open at Xmas, and
Arthur Garner has returned with the harmless
necessary co. Whether Sydney can support two
first-class variety shows, each backed by much
cash and with two men in charge who know the
business to perfection and who mean to stay, is a
question that remains to be decided. If it can’t
then something must crack, and when it does
crack it will be a very big crack indeed.

“ The Two Orphans,” a story of woe in
six chapters, unfolds itself to fluctuating audiences
at Melb. Royal. The general tendency of this
adaptation from the Erench is so sad that Jacques,
the villain of the show, figures as “comic relief ”
and even appears to sparkle like a squib in a coal-
cellar. Jacques, under ordinary circumstances
would not be a gladsome item. He persecutes the
halt and the blind, converts his female victims
into petty larcenists, and leads his wicked old
mamma into grog-shops. All the same, he illumi-
nates the gloom, and is popular. When his
afflicted brother stabs him in the stomach, where
he was about to stow away a bullock’s heart with
fash stuffing, the gallery is glad to hear that
Jacques will recover, and live to be hanged
George Rignold, in this leading character, doesn’t
make vice attractive, but he gives it an air of
happiness. His laugh combines the ring of the
merry joy-bell with the muffled note of °the fog-
horn. In fact, he and his depraved parent are the
on y people who get any amusement out of life.
All the others are employed in seeking calamity
and putting salt on Sorrow’s tail, so “ The Two
Orphans ” is quite a suitable introduction to the
racing carnival.

The acting at the Royal achieves a satis-
factory average, not as good as in “ Called Back ”
a while ago but good enough. The orphans, Miss
Emily Hughes and Miss Watts Phillips, although
rather lacking in youth and innocence, are other-
wise effective. Every time they are required to
rise to a melancholy occasion they rise in a natural
manner. Also Miss Lindahl, an inexperienced
actress who plays a soiled dove at a reformatory
bears herself prettily in a pathetic position ; and
Miss Bessie Vivian, as La Froehard, is a mother
ot whom any Jacques might be proud. H. W.
Diver, as the love-sick cripple, looks more like a
sham poet than a genuine knife-grinder ; never-
theless there is'sincerity in his method and an
admirable thinness about his legs. And he fights
craftily. Nobody could surpass Diver at sticking
a knife into the leading man’s digestion, or seem-
mg agreeably horrified when the weapon gets
there. Plunmer, who begins to spoil himself by a
feminine trick of blinking his pencilled eyelids at
space, is a sprightly champion of beauty in dis-
tress, and the six acts produce some of Clint’s best
scenery. On Saturday night Geor-e Rignold
scored a crowded house by distributing a bicycle,
which fell to the lot of a small boy situated near
the roof.
At the Alexandra, a revival of “ Monte
Cristo ” gave the customary pleasure to a limited
congregation last Saturday. The Bulletin feels
bound to speak softly of “ Monte Cristo ” for the
sake of old burlesque associations, and because it
is a droll entertainment when taken seriously.
One never knows where the drama will get to
within the next half-hour. It is likewise impos-
sible to guess where any given person will be the
next time he appears, and when he has appeared
next time the things that have happened to him
during the interval puzzle the understanding and
prevent a thoughtful observer from feeling tired.
Alfred Dampier is about the most consistent
feature of the struggle, He gets dragged away
to prison in the prologue, and is duly continued in
the next act, where he mentions that he has been
gnawing the stone walls of his dungeon-cell for 14
years. Soon afterwards he is thrown into a seeth-
ing ocean in a sack, and thenceforth his path in
life is paved with gold and crossed by new editions
of the people who hated him when he was younger.
All these have come into a terrible lot of money,
the same as Dampier. If they were ordinary
bloated capitalists, and if Dampier could persuade
himself to retire into private life on ten millions
sterling, the drama would probably end here. But
the fortunate gentleman from gaol prowls around,
waiting and hoping for vengeance, until his
jealous rivals of long ago have mostly died of vio-
lence at his hands. An odd one, who escapes
destruction, merely falls into the hands of the
police. Alfred Dampier, the inflexible Edmund
Holloway, Appleton, Lachlan M‘Cowan and
George Buller are creditably concerned in this
affair, but they will probably be concerned in
something different shortly.

“ Henry V. ” is to be placed upon the
extensive stage of Melb. Royal on Saturday
(31st) “in response to numerous requests, and in
commemoration of that great Battle of Agin-
court.” Probably the Hagincourt anniversary,
which was several days previous to the date fixed
for this revival, didn’t influence the Rignoldian
spirit so deeply as the numerous requesters.
There is always a moderate demand for Shake-
speare’s jingo panorama, and a Melb. generation
that would like to meet the original George Rex
has grown up since he last appeared on his milk-
white steed.

A fearful conflict of Melbourne shows com-
mences this week. At the Princess’s they promise
another spell of “ Djin-Djin,” with a fresh cast,
and the Lumiere Cinematographe (truly a fine
draw, for the other ’graphe is not a circumstance
to it) on Derby night, when the Bijou will have a
grand re-opening under Brough management. “ A
Mother of Three ’’ is the programme appointed for
this latter interesting occasion. It will sail in
upon a wave of Sydney success, and the Bijou has
been redecorated to receive visitors.

To-night (Thursday) the Carnival of All
Nations falls due at Melb. Exhibition Building.
Something like =£lo,ooo is to be expended on the
Carnival. Each shilling admission ticket entitles
bearer to a remote chance of winning a golden
pyramid worth £6OO, or other useful article,
guaranteed genuine and saleable at the Mint.
“Art union” tickets, by the way, admit to the
show on afternoons only. People who.arrive at
night will be required to pay a shilling for what
they can see at the time, which will not include a
vision of winning a great hunk of gold in the
lottery. Eitzgerald Bros.' London Novelty Co.
under the Dome, and the same firm’s circus
under canvas in the Quadrangle* are principal
attractions. The Novelty Co. includes Mile.
Antonio, the poetic trapezist, and Mahomet, the
famous platform-rapper, and everybody else who
appeared at the same place last year, with the ex-
ception of poor Peart. That indomitable professor
is now— The Bulletin hopes and believes—diving
from a rainbow platform into the Jasper Sea.

At the Athenaeum Hall, a Yitascope,
claiming to be superior to all other scopes and
graphs of a similar character, will give a loaning
picture-show during race-week. Which somehow
reminds The Bulletin that Lady Brassey’s Eund
in add of the local Blind Asylum, is to have a
matinee-benefit at the Princess’s, on Nov. 11.

Cecil Ward’s break with the Brough
Comedy Co. recalls to mind his first appearance
on the Australian stage. It happened at Mel-
bourne Bijou in “ Held by the Enemy,” and re-
vealed the youthful-looking Cecil as an ultra-
romamtic lover with an enormous capacity for
gasping. His heavy method on that occasion, and
for a while afterwards, gave little promise of the
versatility which has made him a popular favorite.
Ward, as we first knew him, was an intelligent
inexperienced actor of the Charles Warner stamp
who might easily have settled down and grown
old in the melodrama-hero groove had he joined
say, Bland Holt’s co. Time was when the Sydney
gallery-boys showed a disposition to “poke borak ”
at the gushful young man, but a course of farcical
comedy with Brough and Boucicault developed his
sense of humor and fitted him for serio-comic
character sketches—such as the aristocratic tippler
in “ Mrs. Tanqueray.” Under B. and B. manage-
ment Cecil Ward played a fairly wide range
of parts in a more or less admirable manner
throughout the chapter. His Tom Jones and
Joseph Andrews, for instance, were very different
people to the boozy Orreyed aforementioned. The
Judge’s son in “A Village Priest” was a con-
siderable contrast to Joseph Surface, and the
weak-kneed earl in “The Amazons ” had no points
of resemblance to gallant Claudio in “ Much Ado
About Nothing.” Seriously sentimental in such
modern plays as “ Mrs. Ebbsmith ” and “ The New
Woman,’’the adaptable Ward could play the fool
joyously in farces, or adopt a bright, gentlemanly
middle course, as m “ The Magistrate,” and The
Bulletin takes this opportunity to congratulate
its old young friend, on behalf of Australia in
general, upon the all-round results of his strict
attention to business during the past 10 years.
At Poverty Point.
The f ifth anniversary of Signor Majeroni’s death-Oct
M, 1891—was In Memoriamised by his widow and sons last
week. How time slips away !
Charles Godfrey told a Christchurch interviewer that he
expected to make a hit in England with a dramatic
sketch of Australian interest by “ Banjo ” Paterson. He
talks of sailing in April, accompanied by Miss Ada Baker
‘little Trixie,” Miss Galletley (of the long le«'s) J B
Bam and the Bovis Bros.
The Exchange Hotel, Adelaide, stands just as Coppin
left it over 30 years ago, after making his fortune as
licensee. Then it was one of the best houses in Adelaide
as an hotel and restaurant; even now it does the best
bar trade.
Rignold struck a brilliant idea when he sent a company
of truculent supers dressed in soldiers’ uniforms, and
headed by Warneeke’s band, to march through Bourke-
street as an advertisement for “Tommy Atkins.” The
court, however, fined him ss. for having organised
an illegal procession. This was probably just the addi-
tional advt. that George wanted. Only it came too late.
The Court was mean enough, or cute enough, not to deal
with the case until the run of the play was over.
“A Night Out,” now being played at London Vaude-
ville—a wildly-hilarious and highly-suggestive French
adaptation—is to be produced in' Australia. If for
nothing else, writes a Bulletin correspondent, the night-
gown dance of four young maidens will bring the bald-
heads to the show. Much of it, however (the play
generally and not the dance), is flatly vulgar— which
accounts for its long run in London in the middle of the
dead season.
“ The Billy ” : Tie Mrs. Potter’s additions to Sheridan. I
recollect going to Hobart theatre to see Miln a< Antony,
in “Julius Caesar.” I had carefully read the play first.
At the end of the assassination scene' Miln, in giving the
speech beginning “ O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of
earth,” cut it short at “ Cry havoc ! and let slip the dogs
of war,” arid ■ threw himself down, apparently fainting,
and I waited to see if the curtain would fall on him, as he
deserved. It nearly did. When I consider the actual
end of the scene, and the incongruity of Antony fainting,
when he ought to be hurrying to the forum, I kneel down
and thank Shakespeare’s ghost I’m not an actor.
Melb. Opera House pioneers by opening a cyclery for
the reception of the machines of cycling patrons.. Par-
sons states that every' theatre he visited in America was
so fitted, though in England, the birthplace of the wheel,
the play-going cyclist has still to leave his jigger against
the kerb, chancing theft or injury, or to tip a small boy,
possibly a cycle thief himself, to keep an eye on the pre-
cious instrument.
Annie Taylor acted Kitty Wobbler to Fred Marshall's
Charley Spraggs. in “Blow forßlnv.” When poor M.’s
mind was going, he sat in a sidebox, at Melb. Bijou,
watching another Spraggs, and had to be held back from
jumping on the stage.
Sydney Lyceum Theatre is advertised to let from
Boxing Night, when Williamson and Musgrove’s lease
expires.
Miss Lily Maddocks, of the Melb. Lyric Club, a pretty-
little lady with a pretty' little voice, is said to be going
’Ome for vocal culture. In this instance the stereotyped
announcement that the fair emigrant intends to study
under Madame Marchesi is mercifully omitted.
Nellie Stewart’s disappointment at the failure of Mus-
grove to build a London theatre for her, is reported
among her friends in Melbourne to be “profound.” But
London is over-theatred, and a fetching and talented
actress who is recognised queen in her own country might
very well rest content with that distinction. The London
theatrical speculators have too many of their own Nellie
Stewarts—or their equivalent—to provide queendoms for
others.
The financial success of Trebelli’s Australian tour has
led to the engagement of Albani by' the Vert Brothers.
Australia will now really listen to a genuine oratorio
soprano. Albani’s attainments extend to all departments
of her art. Whether in oratorio or in secular singing, she
is listened to as respectfully as any singer living.
Six members of the Frantz Family are said to be relate:!
to one another by blood or marriage. The strong woman
is the mother of one of the boy's and the wife of the dapper
little man, who is the brother of the other two women.
One of these is married to the taller man.
Madame Anna Ruppert, Alfred Dampier’s London
backer, who died the other day, made her fortune out of
a half-guinea face-wash which was simply' a weak solution
of corrosive sublimate, worth about a half-penny a pint.
The police ejected her from Germany, where there is a
law providing for the careful escort over the frontier of
the swindling quack.
The recent quotation by The Bulletin of Mrs. Meynell’s
“ He has an exquisite style to refrain from,” recalls to the
present scribe Lawrence’s (late of Brough, Boucicault Co.)
remark to an aspiring actress : “ Come with me, my dear,
and see Mrs. ■ — act. You will see everything that
you will have to avoid if you wish to become an actress.”

his life to end with a ‘ Quixote,’ and—poor Du Maurier.”
A Melbourne musician gave all his old linen, plainly

that he is still in active operation, and not a denmed

_ George Rignold came within range of possible destruc-
tion last week. That is to say, he hired a furnished house
where there was an escape of gas, and if the escape hadn’t
been discovered until after his arrival on the scene
(instead of long before he took possession), and if the
person who made the discovery had applied a lighted
candle to the gassy' atmosphere in Rignold’s presence,
instead of opening all the windows and feeling for a
severed gas-pipe in the dark whilst the theatrical manager
was far away, then would Rignold aforesaid and the
premises in question have been biffed into atoms with a
bang, provided there was enough gas to do it.

The National Bank (Melbourne) publishes a
balance-sheet, which might be a great deal worse, yet is
only moderately good at the best. The net profit for past
six months is £11,707, as compared with four previous
half-yearly records of £10,523, £13,762, £15,126, and
£25,231. Consequently, things are better than they were
last half-year, and a great deal worse than during the
three preceding ones. During the half the National
has paid off over £1,600,000 of its reconstructed 4j per
cent, deposits, reducing the amount due to £3,265,000,
and the saving thus effected was expected to produce
rather better results. Preference shareholders get a 5 per
cent, dividend, which absorbs £7644, and, as the balance
would only run to a dividend of 10s. per cent, per annum
on ordinary capital, the ordinary shareholders are left out,
as usual. The National requires to earn fully £48,000
for the half-year before it can pay 5 per cent, all round,
and when the ordinary shareholders compare this figure
with the £11,707 actually earned, the smallness of their
present chances is sufficiently apparent. The National
has a splendid business; note circulation has increased
£4OOO in the half-year ; new deposits have increased by
£900,000 ; and cash and liquid assets reach the very lanre
total, despite the repayments of old deposits, of £2,780,000;
also, the new capital is coming in well, and the fixed
deposits actually sell above par, and the preference shares
are at a premium, and even the ordinary ones are saleable
at a big discount. With its immense reserves and the
steady expansion of business the National should soon be
able to release the remainder of its 4J per cent, deposits,
and then it will have a fair chance to do some good for
itself.
Against these bright features there are one or
two decidedly bad ones. The National lately wrote off
the last of its reserve-fund to cover losses. Owing to its
insensate desire to pay dividends it has only accumulated
since ’93, despite its comparatively large earnings, a credit
balance of £16,500. If there are any further heavy losses
to provide for they must come out of capital, and if the
smallness of the recent profit is a criterion the chances
are that there will be further losses to meet. The insti-
tution has nearly £400,000 in Government securities, and
over £600,000 in municipal debentures, and if these yield
only 31 per cent, all round they account for a lot more
than the whole net profit, so the inference is that the
banking business at the present time doesn’t pay ex-
penses. If the National would think seriously over this
state of things it would, perhaps, go a good deal
slower in the matter of dividends and be a lot the better
for it.
* * * *
The balance-sheet of the Colonial Bank (Mel-
bourne) suggests that something is very much wrong with
that luckless institution. The half-year’s profit is £2004
as compared with £2564 for previous half-year, £7BO for
the one before, and a loss of £4694 for six months ended
March, ’95. At the last-named date, however, the
Colonial was still paying 4)4 per cent, interest on its
deposits ; it now pays only 2)4, and the difference repre-
sents a saving of about £15,500 for the half-year. There-
fore, if things were as good with the bank as at March,
’95, it should have a profit of about £ll,OOO, and the
present state of things shows that in 18 months its profits
have really dropped between £BOOO and £9OOO. A very
little more falling-off would leave the Colonial unable to
pay even its reduced percentage, and when an institu-
tion gets such an immense concession and yet only yields a
return of about nine shillings per cent, per annum on
capital, its position looks simply abject. And when it is
further considered that it has looked worse with every
consecutive balance-sheet for the last two years, it doesn’t
improve the prospect. The Colonial seems to experience
an increasing difficulty in collecting calls, and the amount
unpaid is now £44,800. In a recent report it was stated
that the falling-off was due, in part at least, to the diffi-
culty in finding safe investments for the bank’s cash.
This might apply in other cases ; in the case of the Colonial
it is distinctly thin. An institution which gets the bulk
of its deposits at £2 10s. per cent, can afford to put its
surplus money into State debentures, of which there are
plenty to be got yielding £3 3s. per cent, or more, and
annex the difference, yet the Colonial doesn’t avail it-
self of this obvious resource, and has only £lOOO worth
of State securities among its assets.
The Colonial is another institution which is
to write off lost capital when the Companies Act
passes. Meanwhile it keeps strictly dark as to the
amount of its losses and the extent of the proposed
operation. If affairs don’t improve, however, it will be
necessary to write off all the ordinary capital (£562,000)
and practically “ chuck out ” the original shareholders,
and hand over the whole concern to the preference crowd
in order to make the profit run to even a 1£ per cent,
dividend. In fact it wouldn’t quite run to it even then.
And if it is proposed to put the Colonial on a 4 per cent,
dividend basis it will be necessary, at the present rate of
profit-making, to write off all the ordinary and two-thirds
of the preference capital. These figures seem to show
that there isn’t much hope in being a Colonial ordinary
shareholder, and none too much in being a preference one.
* * * *
The report of the Royal Bank (Melbourne) for
the half-year ended 30th Sept, shows no improvement
anywhere. The profits are £2043, whereas they were
£2099 for last half-year, and £2038, £2136 and £2875 for
the three previous ones. Therefore things are distinctly
not getting better; in fact, they are, on the whole,
rather worse, and the general tendency has been down-
ward for 2) years. The profit is something like £1 7s. 3d.
per cent, per annum on capital, which is a very humble
percentage, and again no dividend is paid. During the
half-year deposits have increased by £BOOO, and the busi-
ness in general seems well maintained. Also the dismal
smallness of the profits is not owing to the Royal having
large sums locked up in magnificent premises and gaudy
furniture ; it rents its office, and furniture, fittings,
stationery, &c., are all set down at £212. Therefore, the
natural assumption is that the worst trouble lies in the
unprofitableness of some of the advances. For at least five
successive balance-sheets the Royal’s directors have re-
marked that when the new Companies Act, authorising
the writing-off of vanished capital, passes the Victorian
Parliament, it will be necessary to write off capital
to provide for losses, and this time the same old
observation comes along once more. Yet in all the
time that this weary statement has been appearing, no
information has been offered as to the amount of
the losses, or the amount of capital to be written off, nor
has any attempt been made to put things straight in the
meantime by debiting profit and loss with the shortage,
and even the simple idea of writing off the £21,521 now
at credit of profit and loss, by way of putting things
partly straight, has seemingly not occurred to anybody.
And the patient shareholders haven’t kicked once at this
amazing reticence.
On the face of things the situation doesn’t, look
promising. If the Royal is going to pay a humble 3 per
cent, dividend, then on the present basis it has to write
off £165,000 out of its £300,000 paid-up capital ; and to
become even a 2 per cent. div.-paying concern it must
write off £lOO,OOO. In fact, if there is to be anything
worth calling a dividend the writing-off must be very
heavy. And as the reality of things( so far as the share-
holders are concerned) can hardly be much worse than
the outward appearance the board might as well explain
the. situation frankly.

The Australian Joint Stock Bank proposes to
ask its reconstructed depositors to make a further re-
arrangement. Presumably the intention is to obtain a
reduction of interest from the present 4J4 per cent, rate,
and a further extension of time for repayment. The pro-
ceeding looks rather unaccountable in view of recent
balance-sheets. In three e^ 3 ,.£l° () AQ' J fc '^' £5 368,000, pay

The Reid Govt, is offering two N.S.W. loans
for subscription in Sydney. One is for L 420 320 th e other
for £2,196,892; so the total offered is £2,617,212._ lney
both carry 3 per cent, interest, and the public is invited
to take them at par. This is a tolerably unkind way of
giving the local investor a show. When N.S.W. floated
its other 3 per cent, loan John Bull was allowed to get it
at a rate which netted the Govt, about £95 2s. for each
£lOO debenture, but the local man isn’t to be allowed to
invest unless he pays the full £lOO. In other words, the
N.S.W. Govt, gives J. Bull £3 4s. per cent, interest net, but
if the Cornstalk is willing to lend the money at £3 per
cent, less income-tax he may come in—not otherwise. If
he doesn’t take the offer it will, presumably, be decided
that floating loans locally is a failure. So far, things
have gone well, £150,000 being subscribed in three days,
so there is evidently going to be no absolute failure about
the business. But if it succeeds it will be a dismal com-
mentary on the policy by which the last loan was put on
the London market at a serious loss, after the Reid Govt,
had distinctly announced its resolve to rely on local re-
sources.

According to Coghlan’s “ Seven Colonies,” New
South Wales spent, during last financial year, £559,000
of borrowed money on works which yield no re-
venue; Queensland spent £310,000 ; Westralia, £240,000;
S.A., £181,000; Maoriland, £170,000 ; Tasmania, £llO,OOO ;
and Victoria absolutely nothing. The safe principle to go
upon is that public works which yield no revenue should
be paid for out of revenue only, and it is noteworthy that
every province which had an alleged surplus last yea,r got
it by the old, commonplace swindle of charging ordinary
expenditure to loans. On a fair basis the Seven Pro-
vinces had seven large deficits, only six of them cooked
their accounts with a view to concealing the fact, and the
Victorian balance-sheet was the one honest document of
the crowd.
* * * »
The N.S.W. Land-tax assessments were issued
last week, and a howl of rage such as the province hasn’t
heard for many years has gone up to the heavens. Ac-
cording to general report the assessment is a truly won-
derful affair. Cases are quoted in which the Government
valuation for land only is four times or 3) times the
municipal assessment for land and improvements, where
a property yielding £5O a year is valued at £5OOO, where
land that fetched £lO a foot in the boom days and is now
unsaleable at £8 is valued at £27 10s.: and the like. One
daily paper tells a tale of a man who is vainly trying to
sell land with buildings thereon for £l9OO and who finds
the land alone taxed at £3OOO ; and another concerning
an individual who paid £9OOO in the boom days for land,
with buildings on it that then let for £4OO a year, and
who finds that after five or six years’ depreciation, the
land alone is valued by Government at £9OO0 —just what
it and the buildings were worth before the slump. Three
things that make the tax-payer particularly rampant are :
(1) That even if his assessment is hopelessly wrong and
the fact is admitted, he must pay up in full and skirmish
at the Treasury for a refund afterwards. (2) Even if he
appeals successfully and it is decided that the valuation
is absurd, he must pay his own costs. (3) If he pays this
time he has no chance of appealing again for five years.
These three facts make a good many people use language
about the Tax Department which is wholly unprintable.

The Queensland Deposit Bank, which has
already done two reconstructions, looks as if a third
one is imminent. The present idea is that depositors
should take part payment in land and that the bank
should owe them the rest at 3 per cent, instead of 4J4 as
at present. Think of getting back half your hard-earned
savings in the shape of an unsaleable, squashy allotment
below flood-mark way down the Brisbane River, and the
guarantee of a three-times-reconstructed bank that the
rest will be forthcoming in cash when the institution feels
quite rested !

The large and much-reconstructed St. Joseph’s
Investment and Building Society (Sydney) proposes still
another re-arrangement. The idea this time is that pay-
ment of the instalments of principal shall cease till
things mend, and the fact that the last £lB,OOO paid to
depositors was raised on mortgage shows that the case is
tolerably urgent. This new collapse is set down to the
continued fall in the value of property, which has slumped
in the last 12 months beyond all precedent, and to the
fact that houses are a drug in the market and St. Joseph
is generally unsaleable.

Tooth and Co. (Ld.), the big Sydney brewers,
show a profit for the half-year of £35,772, which is almost
£BOOO less than previous half, and with previous balance,
£44,386 is available. A 7 per cent, dividend takes £31,500:
reserve, £5OOO (making it £65,000); depreciation written
off, £3OOO ; and £4886 carried forward.
* * * *
Illawarra (N.S.W.) Steamship Co. made a pro-
fit of £2203 for the half-year ended 30th September, and
as the usual dividend of 8)4 per cent, absorbs £2489, it
naturally follows that the previous balance is reduced by
£286 to make up the deficiency. This undue craving for
the odd J 4 per cent., if persisted in too long, will bring
the Illawarra Co. into trouble.

J.N. : After reading your papers, your case
against the Colonial Mutual doesn’t amount to anything.
A State Life Insurance Department would have to treat
its members in exactly the same fashion if it wished to
remain solvent. The figures pan out as follows: You
paid about £BO in premiums and then borrowed £4O. You
never paid interest, and later on interest arrears and
further borrowings made the loan £77 against premiums
paid of £163. Then you kept on not paying interest, and
assumed that the amount (about £6 ss. a year, steadily-
increasing as the debt accumulated) would be covered by
the bonuses. The papers you send show that the bonus
averaged £5 a year (£5 payable at death, that is), and the
table on the back shows that £5 payable at death, per-
haps 25 years ahead, was equal to £2 in immediate
cash. You chose to take it for granted that £2 would
pay £6 ss. or more, despite clear intimation to the con-
trary ; but naturally it didn’t. If you expected, when the
second loan was fixed up, that the society could give you
back over £6 a year out of £l7, you wanted more than
the richest insurance co. on earth could give. In the end
you owed £153 10s. for principal and interest, and that
swallowed up the surrender value of your policy', on which
you paid £314. In exchange for the difference you were
insured for £5OO during 18.) years, so you didn’t lose it —
you got value in return. The whole trouble seems to be
in your inability to understand some very simple figures.

The Stock Exchange of Melbourne held its
annual meeting last week. There was an under-current
of excitement in the proceedings, owing to a strong desire
to prevent the election as chairman of a young' gentle-
man who had been acting in that position for some time
temporarily. Finally, the new committee chose Mr.
Reggy Clarke as chairman. All old Bendigonians know
him.

New South Wales is now, and has been for a
long time back, the boss mineral-producing province of
Australasia. For 1895, its total production of minerals
was worth ±4,413,000. Victoria came next with
±3 090 000 : then Queensland, ±2,495,000; Maoriland,
±1'587',000 ; and Westralia, ±902,000. Tasmania and S. A.
brought upjthe rear. „ „
For the four weeks to Oct. 15, the B.H. Pro-
prietary output was—Gold, 4090 z. ; silver, 646,0860 z.; soft
lead, 1500 tons; antimonial lead, 50 tons; copper (in
matte), 44 tons ; and an additional 27,9360 z. silver in
matte.’ Some of the figures are estimated, of course ; for
this company reckons it more important to make money
than to permit any break in the operations to count it.
Approximately the value of the four weeks’ out-turn is
±108,250. It takes ±48,000 to pay a monthly shilling div.
North Central shaft has now crept down to
515 ft. Bottom still in terribly hard quartz, through
which from 4ft. to 6ft. per week can be laboriously carved.
Surely this is the kind of work which the diamond drill
ought to do.
The B.H. North finances have been in a poor
way, but the difficulties have been tided over temporarily.
Junction North has made further contracts for
the sale of high-class ore—the latest being for export.
The demand for this mine’s stuff is unusually keen.
The British B.H. now treats in its concentrating
mill about half sulphides and half concentrates. With
the increasing development the risk of “ runs ” or
“ creeps ”in this mine grows. The management had one
little warning, the other day. But even if one of the
main shafts, is from this or any other cause, temporarily
disabled the haulage appliances here are so complete that
the other shaft will be able to keep the mill fully
supplied.
It is proposed in Melb. that the several concen-
trating plants at Broken Hill should be tested by an inter-
change of ore. The idea is that parcels of, say, 500 tons
of ore, of equal value and of the same character,
should be sent to the different mills. The South mill
will probably have a run on Block 10 ore, and Block 10
will also suggest an exchange with the British. The
North and the South being in the same “ stable,” no diffi-
culty is experienced in effecting an exchange so far as
they are concerned. This step is taken on account of the
impossibility (previously referred to) of gauging the real
value of the work done by the figures issued periodically.
Take Block 10 ore, for instance. It is impossible to say
how much the comparative lack of success is due—or, to
put it in another way, how many of the difficulties that
have arisen are due—to the undoubtedly very complex
ores, and how much to the undoubtedly very complex
machinery which Capt. Warren designed, and which is
now turning his hair grey. Only by running- them on the ;
same ore can the respective merits of the same mills be
gauged and the fads and fancies of the several engineers
be satisfactorily tested. At the same time, it will have to
be borne in niind that the plant which may the most
successfully deal with one class of ore may be a compara-
tive failure when run upon another class. Thus, a mine
whose sulphides are hard requires a larger crushing power
in proportion to jigs, &e., than such a mine as the British,
most of whose ore is, so far, fairly soft.
Talking of the hardness and softness of the
sulphides, the variations are phenomenal. In the
Junction’s rich stuff in places, one can drive a crowbar a
foot or two. At Block 14, however, a couple of hundred
yards or so away, some of the sulphides are only slightly
softer than the best drill steel. A 2ft. 6in. hole recently
took two men over six hours to drill ; and it was not un-
usual for three or four blows of the hammer to render the
drill useless until re-sharpened. Nor are these Block 14
records due to poor mining. On the contrary, Block 14,
having always been one of the best-managed mines on the
field, naturally always has had the best of the miners.

From Drake, N.S.W., comes the report that a
vein two feet thick of almost solid silver has been’ struck
in the White Rock mine, and from Wollongong comes the
news that the mine is now owned by the Smelting Co. of
Australia (whose “ stack at Lake Illawarra is 165 ft. high,
is finished, and a higher one still is in course of erection ”).
Well, the White Rock having up to date been a gigantic
disappointment, it is about time it had something by way
of a surprise, and two feet of solid silver would about do
the trick. If a discount of 50 per cent, is made “soas to
be well within the mark,” the ore would be worth con-
siderably over ±2OOO a ton and prove the mine not very
low grade, after all.

The good old grand-motherly S.M. Herald has
been requested to state that the Young Bushman’s gold-
mine, whose prospectus is out, has produced over 800 oz.
of gold, “ the yields averaging from 15dwts. to 3 and 4oz.
to the ton.” When? Which? What? Last year or 20
years ago ? The writer knows a mine that has produced
over 8000 oz. of gold, and it can be had for pegging out.
Forming cos. to reopen old mines, instead of small work-
ing syndicates to prospeot them, is the curse of mining
in N.S.W.

Adelong, N.S.W. : “ The monthly escort left
to-day, taking 3530 z., nearly the whole of which was
alluvial.” Once it was the chief gold-camp of N.S.W. Its
total output will run any other field in the province pretty
close. Veins, as a rule, very small and, worse still, in
hard granite country. Adelong thinks it is on the eve of
a great and glorious resurrection. The English co. work-
ing the Gibraltar mine has almost completed a 30-head
stamp mill, cyanide and chlorination works, and is other-
wise preparing to do big things early next year. It owns
several mines beside the Gibraltar, including Shepherd’s
well-known alluvial mine—probably pretty well worked
out, but purchased for the water-power brought on to it
many years ago. The race has been enlarged, and the
power will be used to drive the whole of the reducing
machinerj'. Whether it will do so at all times of the year
is a matter on which opinions differ. Anyhow, the mine
is not quite as well watered as the stock.

A Sydney Sunday Times correspondent vvants
to know why the Ore Recovery shares don’t move “ in the

This is tin sort of thing weighing down W.A.
mining The Scottish Westralia Ltd. offered in London
for public issue the Lindsay’s Find Proprietary of 173
acres containing FIFTEEN gold-bearing reefs for £200,000.
The Scottish Westralia Co. yanks out of this £20,000 cash,
±80,600 shares, and £50,000 in cash or shares as it
chooses. All the reefs were tested by mortar and dish,
and 3,5, 8, and 20oz. per ton coruscate all over the re-
port like spangles on Sadie McDonald's legs. Mr.
Edmund Mitchell, once on Pastoralists’ Review and
Melb. Age, the gent who wrote “A Temple of Death,"
is the guiding spirit of the Scottish Westralia board.
This leads one to think “ The Lindsay’s Find Pro-
prietary” prospectus is perhaps meant as a sequel
to the “Temple of Death” story. David Lindsay,
F.R.G.S., was apparently Mitchell’s collaborateur in writ-
ing the prospectus. Is that the Lindsay who reported on
the Mount Burgess, St. George, Lindsay’s Gold Mines, and
Lindsay’s Extended?

coal in the first bore. It is also doing splendid boring in
N.S. W. and Vic., and the hole on the Perth station, W.A.,

Another man writes to Sydney Sunday Times
declaring the General Gordon as big a mine as the Great
Boulder. That is probably the reason shares have fallen

By-the-bye, these optimistic gentlemen never disclose

Erom a well-known mining man who has made

Erom a well-known mining-manager who made
his name in another country: “ The Lake View, now

would like you to see it yourself, for, without seeing, it is
difficult to appreciate the great change which has taken
place on this camp since you were here.”
Beyond doubt the Boulder, Lake View and
Ivanhoe are now three great gold-mines. No such trans-
formation has taken place in the history of gold-mining.

held 19,500 shares. That rather proves that Bayley him-
self knows little of mining or marketing, or he would have
sold, say at 30s. a share. He also offered to bet a modest
£50,000 that all, or most of, the gold which had been
credited to Bayley’s South mine had come out of the
Reward claim. ’ No one responded to the bet, and the

There is a good deal of sympathy but not
much logic in the Tamworth petition lately pre-
sented to Gov. Hampden on behalf of the Dederers,
now under sentence of death for murder. Its
most conspicuous plea is that both brothers are
only 19, that one of them has never been to school
or church, and that they were born at Boggabri
and have never been more than ten miles away
from it. The common theory is that the person
who is born in rural innocence and never goes out
into the great, wicked, soulless world thereby
escapes a knowledge of evil, and either this as-
sumption has to go overboard or else the fact that
a criminal has lived all his life at Boggabri must
be abandoned as an extenuating circumstance. It
is a melancholy fact, by the way, that N.S.W. is
growing a dismal race of oldest bush inhabitants
who vegetate all their days. Even when they
take to the roving life of a prospector they don’t
rove except feebly and in a narrow circle. There
are townships within 200 miles of Sydney which
contain hardly a soul who has been away more
than 40 miles in half as many years. Apparently
the wandering instinct is dying out of the Corn-
stalk, if he ever possessed it* and he fossilises

King O’Malley’s proposal to abolish bar-

Tuberculosis is found in 30 to 70 per cent,
of the cows in average dairy herds. Wherefore the
British Sanitary Congress at its meeting, just over,
recommended that sanitary authorities advise
public establishments only to buy milk from herds
found pure by Kooh’s tuberculin test, that the
authorities advertise lists of such herds, that
government test free from time to time the herds of
farmers who guarantee to kill off cows found m
fected, that such infected beasts be officially
branded at time of testing, and slaughtered under
special supervision, that killing of all animals for
human consumption be done in supervised official
abattoirs, and that butchers be compensated for car-
cases of beasts condemned after slaughtering which
had not shown signs of wasting diseases when
alive.

The director of Stawell (Vic.) Technical
College has been examining 30 samples of Mel-

tuberculous (i.e. containing the germs of con-

streets exposed to dust and air polluted by the
dried sputum of phthisical persons, &c., is held
responsible for the Walpurgis-night of the microbe
on the outer skin of one sample, tersely described
by this observer as “ a hot-bed of bacteria.” Of 20
samples of milk three were tuberculous, and one of
them contained a brand-new bacillus.

clerical soul doesn t possess one grain of humor to the
sacerdotal ton.
Shop assistants in a West Queensland town
wanted a half-holiday weekly. The first pre-
liminary was the sounding of the Chow store-
keepers on the matter, and when they had con-
sented the European business men followed as a
matter of course. To this has it come—Jack
Smith and Billy Brown have to petition Ho-Ki
and Sin On for leave to breathe a little fresh air
now and again.

WHY THOSE BOWLERS LOST THE MATCH.
CAPTAIN OF THE VISITORS: “ Yes, it’s a bu-iful green, but it’s awfly infeshted with—hie—
shnakes. Why, Alde’man Soak an ’ meself was pickin' 'em off one another all
the afternoon.”
Chinese statistics of a Centralian town
Six Chow storekeepers, four pig-tailed bakers, and
gardeners and fruiterers innumerable. Just a
little outside is a splendid garden run on co-opera-
tive principles by Europeans, but the. white
women prefer John’s vegetables, with their lurk-
ing leprosy, so the Caucasian growers are mostly
left out in the cold. Talk about Cairns ! Some
of the Western and North-Western towns beat it
hollow.

The first prize for the Aust. Natives’ Ass.
fete ’97, will be a gold vase, valued at £lOOO, for
which Melb. Mint offers £975. What’s the rela-
tion between gold vases and Australian nativity ?
N. : “The Presbyter-
ians signalise the extreme
theologic reaction. Round
Melb. the embers die out of
the grand yule logs of the
antique school, and there
are no Elishas after the
Muck Eachrans, Muck
Veans, and Muck Toonals.
The younger pastors are the
most daring of all the clergy.
They smoke on public con-
veyances, and I have noticed
three at that, unblushingly,
for there is no tinge of the
hypocritic. They support
the playhouse, even if they
don’t go, and I myself have
labored, in vain, to persuade
one of them of his wicked-
ness. Omne ignotum pro
magnihco. ”

Demised Evangelist
M‘Neil had a church-bazaar
raffle yarn. A young fellow
won a horse and trap in one,
and went to take his sweet-
heart out for a drive. The
parson showed him a clothes-
horse and a mousetrap, and
the winner said he would be
damned before he went to
that church again—Mac
didn’t put it quite in that
way. But then the Bible
has not one word versus
gambling, and says it is a
good thing to lose your
money.

H. : “Philanthropy in Melb. grows so
kind that there is a danger of fond parental con-
S pj rac i es to get into gaol and leave the family un-

A variation of the good old “ only a little
o ne ” story was given at Melb. divorce court the
other day, when a 16-year-old damsel, with her
golden hair a-hanging down her back, appeared
as co-respondent in a suit in which her sister was
petitioner. “Didn’t you consider it very wrong
to lead your sisters husband astray? asked
the bench severely, when she had owned up.
“ Well ” laughed the short-skirted girl m extenu-
tion, her curls, you see, it was only
once.

The khakee uniform of Vic. militia is
objected to by the officers, because it is not suffi-
ciently gaudy to attract recruits ; by the recruit*
because it does not attract the girls; and by the
girls because it does not attract the jealousy of the
other girls who have not got dirt-colored admirers.
As Commandant Holled-Smith is not likely to
recommend any change, the Vic. fire-eaters will
have to tramp along as heretofore, looking like
animated mustard-plasters, in the rear of a corpu-
lent man mounted on a livery-stable charger, and
with a rooster’s tail in his hat.

H.R.H. the Duke of York attended the
funeral of the late Archbishop of Canterbury as
representative of the Queen, who sent a wreath
marked “ with the greatest regard, friendship and
affection.” Of course. As Ingersoll says, the
throne and the church are twins —vultures from
the same egg. .
By his lean, dejected figger
You may know the Northern nigger
Is a-weeping and a-wailing and a-beating Sorrow’s
drum ;
By his look of desolation
And the way he says “ Damnation ! ”
sTou can bet his soul is burdened and the Bishop
hasn’t come.
By his waist that waxes bigger
You may know the Northern nigger
Is a-calming of his spirit with religion and with
rum;
By his pot that’s always boiling,
By his jaws that keep a-toiling,
You can bet there’s balm in Gilead and the
Bishop’s really come.

“ Motor-cars are finding their way about
London just now at the heels of a man and a red-
flag,” writes a travelling Australian to The Bul-
letin. “The Act abolishing the standard-bearer
takes effect in Nov., when it is expected the
motors will be running into and over one another
in a mechanical matter-of-fact manner without the
exciting relief of plunging steeds and the clatter-
ing of slithering shoes. The assistance a pair of
horses are in sharply arresting the way on a heavy
vehicle will be adequately recognised only when
the slippery asphaltum brakes fail to prevent a car-
motor from tunnelling the Lord-Mayor’s circus-
van and holding a lengthy sitting on the alder-
manic carotid.”

Small wonder that Gov. Brassey is always
ready to speak on all sorts of subjects. His
oratorical stock in trade consists entirely of plati-
tudes—and most of those not even mediaeval but
mummy-old. For instance, speaking on Imperial
Federation —“The essential and practical work to
be done at present is to cultivate in every part of
the empire amongst the English-speaking peoples
a sentiment of mutual love and attachment.”
There now ! But this is exactly what Christianity
has been trying to do on a large scale for the last
nineteen centuries. And steel-bristling, snarling
Europe shows with what success! _ Does Gov.
Brassey—who never loses an opportunity of telling
his vice-subjects how good a Christian he is—
imagine that that bloodless phantom called Im-
perial Federation will succeed where Christianity
has failed ? If so, an earnest evangelist should
be sent to Vic. Govt. House without delav.

In the cannibal
islands, writes a Bul-
letin correspond-
ent, a police-magis-
trate had a native
cook who decamped,
the other day, with-
out giving the
month’s notice ne-
cessary under the
Masters and Ser-
vants law, and as
cooks are scarce lo-
cally, his Worship
got over the diffi-
culty by laying an
information with
himself against the
boy for desertion.
Then he heard the
case himself, and
gave evidence for
himself as complain-
ant, with the result
that the boy was
fined £5 or 6 months
h.l. As the boy
hadn’t fivepence to
his name the magis-
trate got a cook for
six months without
the bother of pay-
ing him.
N.: “The Bish-

would admit Var-
ley’s Adelaide hero
of the hundred se-
ductions, if he had
married, and got
divorced, through
his spouse’s error.
Why not substitute
Penitent for Inno-
cent ? The Holy
Roman way. But

N.S.W. Justice Stephen reckons that hasty
marriages are responsible for half the divorces and
nearly all the troubles which disturb the happi-
ness of young married people. On the other hand,
long “ engagements ” are calamitous to girls who
get jilted at the end of them, except in the few
instances where they lead to a breach of promise
action and substantial damages. Of the two evils,
a long engagement is more agin’ nature than a
hasty marriage, anyhow, and the ill-considered
baby born in rash wedlock is rather more moral
than the infant fruit of a long-drawn-out seduc-
tion.
An Anglo-Australian concerning the Lon-
don barmaid: —
Yes, dear Bulletin, there are fully 80,000 bar-women in
city and suburban London, but few of these many thou-
sands are likely to be “tempted.” “My face is my for-
tune,” the barmaid said, and the young man recognised
that she was in a most insolvent state. The great number
of the London bar-women cannot compare with their
Australian sisters, but are granite-faced citadels of uncer-
tain youth, though undoubted age. Their hard, stony
impregnableness repels the most ruthless invader, or
else shows such ravages of previous vandals as to clearly
indicate the fruit has been long demolished and but the
shrivelled skin remains. They are mostly the warped
wrecks of trim craft that for a brief period cruised in
summer seas, luxuriously fitted and richly manned, to
awaken near the arctic circle in the turmoil of rough
weather, deserted by their men, and only too glad to lay
their worm-eaten, shaky timbers in some safe harbor, secure
from a fatal foundering. This paragraph is slightly in-
volved, but it’s nothing to the man who gets in tow with
a London bar—maid.
A certain boomer of fickle
affections lately secured No. 1 of a
prospective harem without arrang-
ing to pension or otherwise appease
his lawful mate. The lady, being
naturally aggrieved, vowed to get
even. This she decided to do by
opening a boarding-house in a popu-
lous centre, the feature of which
was to be the largest sign which
could be conveniently erected, bear-
ing the following legend: “Mrs.
B. Brown-Jones-Robinson, board-
inghouse-keeper.” Hubby bought
out the prospective hash-house, they
say, at <£soo and a pension.
Busk : “ Saw a droll thing last night—a
ball in a butcher’s shop. Being Friday evening,
after closure, the steel rods around were thickly
hung with mutton carcasses. Nevertheless, on
the nicely-sanded floor there swish-wished the
blue-shirted men, with shiny, plastered-down,
suety hair, embracing ladies in the mazes of the
giddy waltz, to the fascinating strains of the
"Alabama Coon ’on a wheezy concertina. Now
and again, fair shoulders, skirts, and flowery hats
inevitably whisked against the mutton, which
waggled sympathetically.”

ledge as a drinker I speak ; but from my know-
ledge that a Governor would rather pay a stiff

A widely-known man died at Manly last
week in the person of the smiling and kindly
Ered. P. Ruffley, the interment of whose remains
was witnessed by many friends. Mr. Ruffley,
who for years had represented in Sydney some
British and Melb. softgoods interests, was
formerly well-known in Victoria in connection
with the then ruling firm of L. Stevenson and
Sons.
Thus cogently Melb. Age on Premier
Reid s refusal to tell the Sydney Syrian deputa-
tion whether it was intended to exclude Syrians
under the Colored Races Exclusion Bill
It has often been urged by the opponents of representa-
tive government that Actsof Parliament were passed mostly
for giving the lawyers something to do, but this is the
first occasion that a Premier has openly announced, his
intention of passing an ambiguous measure for that pur-
pose. *
The latest version of the alleged Rose-
brook (Vic.) murder-case is a cold-blooded horror
such as the Yankee editor invents when things
are quiet down Kansas way. According to the
story of a married daughter of the deceased, which
tale is backed up by a grand-daughter, they one
night heard shrieks and groans in the next room,
which seemed to suggest that “mother” was
being killed. They let the matter rest at that,
however, and asked no questions. Next day
mother” had disappeared, and the old man said
she had gone away ; but looking casually through
a window they thought they saw mother, de-
ceased, lying on the bed. Nothing was said on
this occasion either. Next night they thought
they heard mother being dragged out of the
house, but no special enquiry was made.
Another time, chancing to look into a shed,
they found mother there, somewhat decom-
posed and with a bag over her—in fact, they seem
to have kept dropping unexpectedly on the lady
for quite a while. This time also the subject was
dropped. Three days later they casually looked
round for her again, but she was gone, and she
didn’t transpire any more till she was found in a
sack—poor mother had “got the sack,” with a
vengeance—in the river with a rope round her
neck. This final uprising seems to have worried
them, and after some hesitation they told the
above story, which, as a plain, business-like nar-
ration of what happened to mother, has some
interest.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
T , ~ Sydney, Oct. 27, 1896.
My Deab Myee—
An unvarying law of sassiety is that, while you
cannot be genteel as plain Smith or Brown, you
can be as genteel as possible if you only wed your
plebeian monosyllable to some high-sounding
name. The various branches of hyphenated
Smiths and Johnsons flourish exceedingly in social
columns in the lists of the Nicest. What makes
the general public so tired is reading those same
lists of names day after day, week after week,
year after year. If there could be a general
muster and roll-call once a year or once a quarter,
or even once a month, “ constant readers ” might
be expected to be intelligent enough to take the
statement as authenticated that “all the Nicest
were present, also the first half-dozen names of
the next-to-nicest.” Or, from time to time, what’s
the matter with having a revision, and publishing
“The following names have been added to the
Nicest set ? Or, if that list is too precious
as a tone-giver to be abbreviated, it might be
kept standing and save the expense of having
it set up over and over again. But names have
their power. An aspiring hostess lately found
that it added greatly to her social standing when
an account of a festival given by her was published
along with the names of all the folk she had in-
vited, whether they turned up or not. She
tactfully supplied the copy, names and all, to
the papers. The affair was such a crush that
nobody knew who was there and who wasn’t. But
to the next shivoo she gave, everybody came. The
clever woman went in upon her chances and won
cind now has floated gracefully into the desired
haven.
In Sight of St. Paul s,” where there is no fog
—when there is you have to run your nose against
the venerable structure before you find out it is
there a great many wonderful things occur.
Some of them are happening now every evening at
Sydney Royal, but, fortunately, I haven’t to un-
ravel deep mysteries of the melodrama, but only
to point out in a humble way the triumphs of Miss
I weedie in Act 3, also the artistic and attractive
setting of the gilded infamy pourtrayed. There
is an Oriental boudoir with Moorish archway and
curtains and luxurious divans and lounges most
beautiful to behold ; the apartment of a weird en-
chantress leading dupes to their ruin, oalled for
short “The Panther”—in reality Miss Watson
with an extra-special gown or two. There are
some well-painted cloths of London’s dome, also
bt. Paul s churchyard, strangely deserted, with not
a bus nor a bobby visible, where an intelligent
hammy Brass strolls off to the Old Bailey via
Cheapside. All the characters finally meet in a
realistic interior in the Cathedral, an irrelevant
duchess weeps over an unnamed hero’s tomb and
the villain suicides behind the sepulchre of Chinese
Cordon.
There is one very strong scene in the play—the
supper-party, where the Panther and her friends,
a.I birds of a feather, wind up their feminine
riu^ er . { a pistol-duel and a conflagration,
the girls dresses are all in tones of cream and
yellow, the hangings are heliotrope, and on the
table are green glasses and yellow candle-shades—
quite a refreshing color-scheme, against which the
injured heroine (Miss Ross) stands out in deep
black. Elizabeth Watson’s tram of maize-watered
silk takes up most of the stage, and V. Vivienne
nyals her m spangly satin, her pretty hair caught
with a diamond comb ; a specially-attractive re-
veller is in cream brocade and real-looking golden
tresses. Another costume assumed by the Panther
lor the destruction of surrounding mankind is
white with exaggerated train, low neck and
poppies-and-lace sleeves. The men’s clothes are
unremarkable. Bland Holt is dressed' in Gentle-
man Joe guise ; Detective Clarkson, with nothing
much to do m the piece, but an unfulfilled mission
in trying to detect the plot, is the swaggerest
. stage “d.” on record.
The desire of beholding the armorial bearings
on their own vehicles ranked up alongside the
Hampden trademark brought out the carriages of
m force on Saturday night last to the
INat Goodwin send-off at the Lyceum. An en-
thusiastic house was so reluctant to part with
the Yankee star that it insisted on a farewell
speech—although during his entire season here the
large crowd of his admirers have been principally
outside the theatre, and, sad to tell, were not
lound inside hanging on his words to any over-
whelming extent. The customary “presenta-
tion worked backward on this occasion, too, and
was made (the day before) to manager Goodman,
but Goodwin has command of plenty money and
can afford to do these little things. His present
wife is a millionairess, and his sound financial
backing has made him philosophical about bad
biz. Why the magnificent Maxine has not been
a greater draw is one of the problems which I, as
a mere woman, am unable to solve. Sydney men
perhaps prefer brains to beauty, as, socially, Ger-
trude has been far more popular than her
statuesque sister, whose manner is refrigerating
while Gertrude is bright. Which view should be
consoling to girls who are ticketed with the “ Not
pretty but so clever ” label. If you look very hard
at Maxine s full-face photo, you can easily con-
th^Zoo VISIOnS a Ille l an choly eagless roosting in
Miss Muntz, a Melb. artist just returned from a
course of study in Paris, has achieved some dis-
tinction there, having been hung at one of this
year s batons. Portrait-painting is her rdle, and
her best-known sitter is the deposed Agent-General!
Lillies, ( who charmed dreary hours in the studio'
by his witty and clever ” conversation with tho
artist. Times are changed since the days of Dr.
J ohnson, who said that portrait-painting was an
indelicate profession for a woman, because it com-
pelled her to stare hard into a man’s face for
hours together.
, , vice-regal nose being out of joint,
the Moral Fete on Saturday at the Agricultural
Grounds was ungraced by His Ex.’s presence,
wny do Guvmentouse inmates always damage
their noses when they trip ? Lady Hopetoun once
wore hers bandaged for weeks after a fall in the
hunting-field, and Captain Wallington’s aquiline
profile was adorned with sticking-plaster after his
bicycle ran into a tram dummy. Lady Hampden
attended the fete accompanied by two daughters,
one with her hat at the most rakish angle ; and the
party, with assorted magnates, sat in a mia-mia
and surveyed the sports, which ran much ,to
childish gambollings on the lawn brightened by
variegated art-muslin and too-familiar crinkled
tissue-paper. With that airy fabric the modern
church-festival clothes itself as with a garment.
“ e n-'te itself was spread out rather thin over the
grounds; there was not enough revel to the
square-inch to be quite perceptible.
.-The rather wilted procession of vehicles trimmed
with flowers and greens looked so thirsty that it
was a wonder nobody was moved to shout drinks
all round with a garden-squirt. Quite the pret-
tiest show was made by the Star cart, the adorners
had forethought of the fading power of greenery
an d used nothing but closely-ranked white and
f e n “looms, Most amateur trimmings were too
full of bracken ferns and other fast-withering
vegetables. The flannel-flowered buggy became
droopy ; a milk-cart looked trim, its taps decked
with ribbons ; an authentic coster-cart with its
neddy was led by its owner in “ pearlies ” and all
complete. Among the bicyclists wheeling around
competitively a smart little jockey of five or so
took everybody’s fancy. Her Ex. distributed
prizes and was presented with a whip adorned
with daffodils and lily-of-the-valley and streamers
of ribbon.
A select few trailed wearily to the Rose-show
opening ceremony at the Town Hall on Wednes-
day 21st. Lady H., her celebrated slimness set
well off by a gracefully-cut black gown, was accom-
panied by Her Ex. of Bananaland, whose muslin
frock did not give us any very thrilling sugges-
tions of Brisbane modes. Having watched the
distinguished visitors sniff critically at the roses,
there was nothing much to do except stand about
and wonder at the inartistic crudeness of the pink
calico decorations.
To a musical enthusiast Trebelli’s clear, bird-
like notes are as refreshing as beer to a bicyclist.
At her Saturday concert in Centennial Hall, a
large audience assembled to applaud Mademoiselle,
who was clad in flowing robes of silver brocade,
and wore no fringe. Many bunches of flowers
were handed up during the evening. The only
other performers were Mr. Weir, warbling ballads,
and Mr. Strauss, with his ’cello. An uncertainty
as to correct garb pervaded the front sitters, some
° f If™ arrived in full-dress, while others hastily
grabbed at their hats and put them under the
seats in order to appear en regie.
Boys’ Brigade, neatly attired in new clothes,
toed the line at the formal opening of its new
hall in Elizabeth-street on Thursday night, and
was lectured by Gov. Hampden in a pleasant,
straightforward speech. H.E.’s remark on the
a . e B’ e< i incivility of Democracy leads me to protest
mildly against the confounding of “manners”
with manner, which is one of the causes of the
disgusted contempt often shown for all outward
form of politeness by the truly polite man. The
hall-mark of the “ gentleman ” is his consideration
towards women, and • where are women better (or
as well) treated than in democratic America ? The
Englishman is really much more courteous to
woman than the Frenchman, because more natural
and less obtrusive. He does not force himself so
much on her notice and then bow and scrape
apologetically to her embarrassment. There are
times when the truest civility to a woman is shown
being politely unconscious of her presence.
Why should a man grab at his hat if there is a
lady m the lift ? A lift is a public conveyance—
he might just as well take it off in a tram, or to
every woman he passes in the street. The ideally-
well-mannered man is the man with no “ manner ”
at all.
Aether Sydney girl has been snapped up by an
Oine competitor. Miss Mabel Gray, the giided
daughter of the late S. W. Gray, is to be married
some time this month to Lieutenant Maurice Fitz-
maurice, R.N., at Emsworth, in Hampshire.
“Passion’s Sway,” a song by the brothers
Hoben, though it does not exactly give the im-
pression of uncontrollable heart-beats of emotion,
is an uncommonly tuneful lay with pleasing modu-
lations.
A new importation here and pro. tem. deserter
from his adored Piccadily is giving great amuse-
ment among the nice people. He is the man who
nevah can wemembah his form of apology for
greeting with a stony stare of non-recognition
even Ins most recently-introduced acquaintance.
Ihe faces of the best set are to him as undis-
tmguishable as the horse which the city man has
ridden for 100 miles and cuts in the street the next
time he meets him, or like babies ; monkeys, green
peas and Chinamen—of whom nobody can “we-
membah” which is which.
The Trilby craze has not been cremated along
with her creator, worse luck. I see “Little
Billee,” as a boy’s front name, printed in a
juvenile ball-list. The name will probably stick,
fc^at y° ull & ster ’ s mature years, when
Tnlby” has become a synonym for vulgarity.
Girls pet names are often absurd misnomers also.
Counting up some of my own acquaintances,
“ Birdie ” belongs to a stout matron of some-and-
thirty ; “ Queenie ” is an insignificant chit of five-
feet-nothing ; “ Dot ” will be appropriate in a few
years for an aged maiden, now nearly 60; “ Muffle ”
is just the average girl, and “ Popsy ” a tall, fair,
dignified damsel, with “ Helen ” in every feature.
A married man I know is still maddened by his
female relatives addressing him as “ Kissie ” and
“Boy.”
Adelaide tradesmen complain that the Buxtons
spend even less than the Kintores did—truly a
terrible indictment. The sole festivities during
the recent stay of the warships were a very select
vice-regal ball and two semi-official dinners. A
kind of financial Scotch mist seems to have per-
manently enveloped Adelaide Govt. House.
I am told of an elegantly-dressed male who has
found out how to live in blissful indolence on no-
thing a week. He advertises for “ Board and
residence, widow preferred,” and, having got his
widow, he pays a deposit. When further pay-
ment is due he puts his arms round the lady’s neck
and gurgles : “ I love you.” If it does not come
off he is requested to leave, and there being no
man he escapes kicking. If it does come off,
there is a cuddlesome widow and free diggings for
three or four months. Most often it does come
off.
In the big scandal mysteriously hinted at in a
leading and select club, the spirits of Cissy,
Geordie, and Josephine are said to have been re-
vived for the occasion, and have been held
responsible for quite a lot of queer rumors.
Almost all the recently-imported American girls
may be expected to discourage their friends from
visiting these parts. They have not found the
local gilded youth at all up to what their fancy
painted. One of the earlier arrivals, with an idea
that she could track and snare squatters in George
or Collins-street, soon discovered her mistake and
took it out in brains by marrying a good-looking
professional. No. 2 left by a recent boat loudly
expressing her disgust at the stony-broke state of
our eligibles, who, moreover, somehow either re-
main adamant to trans-Pacific charms or try to
run a campaign economically. It worries a girl
when a man looks at her with cold, commemora-
tive eye, inwardly calculating the value of all the
presents he has promised her. The only American
visitor who has made a substantial conquest of
late years is the “champagne-cocktail” girl who
got nicely fixed up with a smart dog-cart and
titled adorer, youthful and a peer.
Writes a lady touring in Western Australia :
“ This tour has been awful. We came straight
through and played in Coolgardie to tremendous
business. We have to sleep three in a room, pay-
ing four guineas a week for the accommodation,
and sharing one jug of water and one wash-basin
among us. . . . As for the laundryman, he
charges 12s. 6d. per dozen, and 2s. each for shirts,
and as the red dust which covers the whole
country, and which you have to wade through
knee-deep, gets into everything you wear, you can
imagine the bill ! . . . We never tasted vege-
tables except potatoes ; there was no fresh milk,
and the meat was awful. . . . Nearly all the co.
have been ill. The men all got ‘ Barcoo, ’ a
malady which seems peculiar to out-of-the-way
places—incessant vomiting accompanied by dysen-
tery. . . . And yet, strange to say, as soon as you
become acclimatised to the fields, you don’t know
what it is to have a day’s illness, unless you hap-
pen to catch typhoid. The place is full of it. . . .
is very cute. He would not arrange to
pay our expenses in W.A., and, of course, it has
taken all our salary to pay our way. When you
pay £4 10s. a week board and your washing, you
can imagine there is very little left; consequently
there has been great discontent. . . .
has coined money on the fields, but his co. are
broke.
“The hotelkeepers (continues my correspon-
dent) have to pay their waitresses £3 10s. per
week, and treat them nicely or they clear out; and
God help the poor hotelkeeper ! he can’t get
another for love or money. They all marry well
after being on the fields for three months. All
our girls have each had half-a-dozen proposals of
marriage—even yours truly has had four. They
won’t believe you are married unless your hubby
is with you. After they have known you for five
minutes, they propose to you.”
Prom a letter written to a children’s paper by
the seven-year-old daughter of an Australian
Judge : —“My pa has three servants, three horses,
two dogs, one laughing jackass, three parrots, and
only one wife.”
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“The Melb. Dante Society is flourishing vigor-
ously. Its members number over a hundred, only
about a dozen of whom know anything of the
grim-visaged poet or the Italian tongue, but that
doesn’t prevent the society giving itself frequent
and charming little jamborees, consisting chiefly
of really good music and unique ice-creams. On
Saturday afternoon Consul Corte entertained
all the Melb. smart folk at a garden fete in com-
memoration of the wedding of Italy’s Crown
Prince. The Consul, a bachelor, lives at a fine St.
Kilda house, built in a pre-boom era, and standing
in well-kept grounds. Most of the guests were
‘coming on from’ or ‘going on to’ either the
white knight’s garden-party or the Brassey cycle
sports—and the affair had the appearance of a
dress rehearsal for Cup day. A little comedy, all
about a youth who wanted to be a monk, but who
fell in love with a girl instead, was played in the
wide verandah by Sigs. Corte and Fiaschi and Miss
Law, who seems to be the only native-born Melb.
girl who can ‘ crack Itawlian ’ (as the Scotch say)
with fluency.
“Miss Dudgeon, one of Melb.’s nicest girls,
was very quietly married last week to Lieut.
Manser, an Indian military officer. The couple
will reside at Mandalay, British Burmah. The
mother of the bride, who looks slightly younger
than her daughter, and who is in reality only a few
years her senior, was married less than a year ago
to Hon. Agar Wynne, whose second wife she is.
Both the wives of this fortunate man have brought
him large fortunes, and a short time ago the ex-
P.M.G. made a great haul over a successfully-
floated Westralian mine. He leaves shortly for
London on further mine-launching business.’’
‘ ‘ Rumor couples the names of Lord Shaftesbury
and the. daughter of our only baronet. The
damsel in question, a graceful girl enough, in-
herits little of her mother’s vivacity and social
energy. As for pa, he has always protested that
he did not wish his children to hook English
titles, and, voluntarily or not, the elder ones have
met his wishes in this particular. In many
respects, no doubt, a title is a worry. The ques-
tion of heir-supply, for instance, causes more
bother than enough, and a quiverful of girls with
never a brother among them is even more disas-
trous in baronial halls than elsewhere.
“ No further off than Toorak, there was tearing
of hair a while back when the six-year-old
daughter of a future baronet was introduced to a
superfluous ‘ sissy,’ in place of the confidently-
expected ‘ ikkle brudder.’ And the lamentations
weren’t confined to the nursery, for, apart from
the disappointment proper, an over-sanguine
maternal grandmother had been trotting round
the neighborhood for weeks predicting, or rather
announcing as a dead certainty, the advent of an
heir. When the worst was known, kind friends
shut their eyes to the press announcement, and all
prefaced their congratulatory letters with the
remark that they were so delighted to hear from
Mrs. Grand’mere of the birth of a son.
“At Lady Sargood’s last ‘at home’ the flowers
used as the principal decoration were banksia for-
tuna. * What botanical satire or horticultural
irony is this ? Banksia Fortuna—and the Colonel
is a director of the Commercial.
“Lord Magheramorne, who married A.D.C.
Lord Shaftesbury’s sister and who is now on his
way out with his wife to visit the Brasseys, is
really named Hogg. He is the son of that
M'Garel Hogg who was at the head of the crooked
old ‘ Board of Perks ’ in London before the Demo-
cratic County Council was established. Maghera-
morne is a more mouth-filling name than Hogg,
though perhaps not quite so descriptive.
“ On the occasion of the recent Brassey visit
to the Western district, the school children, at a
place through which the vice-regal party was to
drive on its way to the station of a local
squattocrat, were drawn up in line outside the
school-house to yawn ‘ Gorsave ’ as the carriage
passed. They were all there, expectant and jubi-
lant, waiting for H.E., and presently a cloud of
dust signalled the approach. When the wag-
gonette drove by ‘ Gorsave ’ was poured out with
gusto, followed by three cheers. Then the school
broke up. But presently a fat little man on a
bicycle, dressed in a grey suit, very dusty, and
looking scarlet, tired and hot, rode along. There
was no ‘Gorsave’ for him—only jeers and cries of
‘ Gee up, fatty ! ’ and so on. But lo ! the little fat
man was Baron Brassey, who had elected to ‘ bike ’
after the vehicle.
“ Flashlight portraits of the interiors of churches
and houses of entertainment are now much in
evidence in Melbourne shop-windows. A very
fine view of the inside of the Princess’ Theatre,
taken on a recent Saturday night, has been bought
by a complainant in a divorce-case, for collateral
evidence, as a respondent and co-respondent are
disclosed therein sitting next to one another. One
of the parties had represented to his wife that he
was in Bendigo that night, and if she had not seen
the photograph she might have believed him.
“If the society women who rolled up bare*
necked to hear young Tom Brassey orate on the
anniversary of Trafalgar at Melb. Town Hall,
could have tried the young gentleman for obtain-
ing their presence on false pretences they would
have sentenced him to sit and listen for a week to
a phonographic repetition of his own drawl.
Instead of good breezy stuff about Trafalgar, which
everybody expected, young is simply
an aggravated version of old Tom—merely flung
at his hearers blocks of statistics about the
Empyah. The women wanted no figures about
trade ; they wanted gory flapdoodle about Nelson,
with perhaps some hints on his relations with
Lady Hamilton, just to give spice to the historical
dry facts. But the Brasseys are hopeless cases.
They appear to have sucked in figures with their
mother’s milk, and the complaint comes out upon
them in • tabulated carbuncles and statistical
rashes.”
Yours affectionately,
CLEO.

The rumored retirement of Justice* iruies,
iow that his pension-date is due, brings up the
.act that Australian Judges, if they don’t retire
and claim pension before the due date, seldom fail
to get on the list as soon as the clock strikes.
English Judges work on, oblivious of this time-
limit, and take pensions only when mentally or
physically played out.
As Oxford University has lately conferred

Ex-Primate Barry, Sydney’s old aproned-
exhorter, is now waging war against the massage-.
dens of the West End of London. In the Parish of
St. James, perhaps the most crested portion of the
modern Babylon, Dr. Barry professes to have
ferreted out dens of massage infamy. The authori-
ties play the game of “not minding,” which the
Bishop attributes to the lofty station and great
social influence of the massaged votaries.
Col. Haultain, otherwise “the blue-tail

land, had notoriously never been in action in his
life. Col. Tom M.‘Donnell, who ranked with Von
Tempsky as an absolutely fearless Maori fighter,
once reported to Haultain that he had been fired
on by some Maori rebels near Wanganui. “Ah

Haultain, with exasperating indifference. “Can’t

Napier, of Home Rule for Scotland fame, now in
Europe, who used to wear in the streets of Mel-
bourne an extremely short kilt and a Texas Jack
head of hair, and who, when unsuccessful in an
attempt to induce the local Caledonian Society to
eat haggis and drink “ whuskey ” in honor of the
anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, de-
clared that he would, as long as he lived, celebrate
that defeat of trie Sassenach, and “ wi’ the help o’,
the Loard,” he would yet celebrate it in Heaven.
The Bishop of Melanesia appears to be St
large-minded prelate who can make allowances.
Deferring the other day to the massacre of an
Austrian baron and his party in one of the Solo-
mon Islands, he stated that he didn’t look upon it
as an act of treachery at all, but as simply part of
what might be called “the national policy” to
drive back hereditary enemies from the coast.
Bishop, your hand ! This is the policy of The
Bulletin with regard to the Chinese and other
invading aliens. Only this paper, being partially
civilised, is not so thorough as the Solomon Is-
’anders.
e is a story told of “ Jijnmy” Bonner,
r Superintendent of Westland (M.L.), who
e-n nicknamed (in allusion to his politics)
pery Jim,” that he was riding alongside a
and innocent) Governor on the occasion of
... t . try of the latter into Hokitika—or Grey-
. Some one in the crowd yelled, “Three
wwi 1 :. for the Governor! ” The cheers were
vigorously given. Then a local patriot followed
w:b “Three cheers for Slippery Jim!” The
rnvf., responded with wild enthusiasm. The
in . nor turned round to Bonner and said, “ Mr.
..n.. r, may I ask who is Slippery Jim?”
s. Nikorima Pontontara is a Maori lady
* . ■ s one of the chief land-owners of Hauraki
■ elds. She was “caught young” by Lady
n, wife of the first M.L. Chief Justice, and
.. . ven an excellent education. After her mar-
- to a young Maori chief she partially relapsed
■*• • boriginal habits, and it was no infrequent
to see Mrs. Nikorima, in a billy-cock hat
clay pipe in her mouth, playing devil’s-pool
Thames billiard-rooms. Yet Mrs. Niko-
s. could sing a Erench chanson, and was com-
u-.- nted by the Duke of Edinburgh on her
ng at a swell Auckland soiree.
V r Bulletin, —In your notice of the
' i aron von Mueller, you state that he was
h som friend of Leichhardt. lam not aware
jb- matters much, either one way or the other,
3 think this is a popular error, arising from
nstant interest evinced by Von Mueller in
hardt’s fate. The late Baron arrived in
de in 1847. Leichhardt left his last point
of contact with settlement in April, 1 ”48. One
was to V A., one in N.S.W. Von Mueller would,
of con/so, hear of Leichhardt from his famous ’45
trip and also as a fellow-botanist, but the dates
do not permit of much “ bosom friendship,” even
if the two men ever met. —Ernest Faveno.
Allen and Allen, the Sydney firm of
solicitors, go back to the beginning of Australian
law. Grandfather Allen was the first Australian
admitted to practise as a solicitor. At that time,
barristers and solicitors were all one, and, when a
jury needed persuasion, Allen donned wig and
gown and called his fee a honorarium. At other
times, he worked in his bare bald head and charged
the inescapable 6s. Bd. This Allen held the chair
of N.S.W. Leg. Council for some years. His son,
Wigram, afterwards held the Speaker’s chair in
the Leg. Assembly, but stuck closely to law busi-
ness, though his father was W. C. Wentworth’s
chief opponent when the separation of the legal
branches was under discussion. There are nume-
rous young Allens growing up, so that an Allen
is likely to be on the roll when Australia cries “ A
go !”
Yet another old Sydney Reform Club
member has passed away in the person of Mr. C,
A. Goodchap, ex-Commissioner of N.S.W. Rail-
ways, who, in his prime, retired upon a pension of
just under <£looo a year. Mr. Goodchap, whose
name well-expressed his character, was of English
birth. He came to N.S. W r ales in his youth, and
by his tact and ability reached the top of the
ladder in the Railway Department He could have
had one of the new Commissionerships, but pre-
ferred retiring to accepting a secondary position.
With officers, men, and the public at large he was
unfeignedly popular. Some years ago his grit
enabled him to battle through a long and terrible
illness, from which, to all appearance, he had
thoroughly recovered; and when, but a week
or two ago, he went to see his sick friend, A. C.
Fraser, the latter said : “ They tell me I’m dying,
Goodchap—but you, why you look good for
another 20 years.” Notwithstanding which,
Goodchap preceded Fraser to the grave by a day.
Dr. M‘Laurin, M.D. (Edinburgh), M.A.,
and L.L.D. (St. Andrews), and M.L.C. (N.S.W.),
the newly-elected Chancellor of Sydney Univer-
sity, is a 61-years-old Scotsman, and one of Aus-
tralia’s few scholarly Conservatives. His life’s
training has imbued his mind with Draconian
traditions ; in ’5B he went from the e 1 as deal school-
ing of the University, and the severe doctrines of
ts medical profcsrcis to the inexorable discipline
Dr. M‘ LAURI N, the new Chancellor of
Sydney University.

of the navy. And, becoming ship’s surgeon at
the impressionable age of 23, and serving in that
capacity for thirteen years, he became moulded in
the principles of inflexibility. He says: “Aneasy
ship is an unhappy siiip; but a hard ship is happy.”
His ideal of government is reached when the laws
are so severe and so effective that the man who
obeys is perfectly safe, and the man who disobeys,
perfectly unsafe. “ When I was ship’s surgeon an
offender against the ship’s discipline could either
be put to death or receive whatever other punish-
ment court-martial might deem justifiable.” Of
flogging he says, “Only bad characters were flogged
in the navy, and the culprit always deserved each
lash of his punishment. On the Marlborough we
had 1140 hands, and they were not all angels.
One virtue of flogging is that, while it gives a man
an unpleasant experience which he won’t forget
for some time,' it allows you to utilise his ser-
vices in a day or two; he isn’t doing
nothing for a month in prison. The
severest flogging ever I saw was not administered
by the hand of authority, but was given by the.
crew themselves to one of their number. One
very old subordinate officer told me ‘ a man is not
a man until he’s been flogged.’ One of the punish-
ments inflicted when 1 was in the navy was to
make an offender toe a line, in the presence of the
crew, and swallow his daily allowance of rum
with six parts of water instead of three.” Dr.
M‘Laurin settled in Sydney in ’O9 : he has since
then always been a member of N.S.W. Board of
Public Health ; he became a member of Sydney
University senate in ’B3. He is one of the Uni-
versity’s examiners in medicine. In ’B9 he was
chosen by Dibbs as an M.L.C. The doctor is a
most excellent speaker, and full of pawky humor
of the James Service sort. As a practitioner, his
keen medical instinct and strong common sense
have won him the respect of the profession, and
the confidence of many patients. But let us thank
Heaven that Dr. M‘Laurin and those who think
with him can’t politically boss Australia. For
where you find one high-toned, clean-handed,
alert-minded Tory such as he, you find a hundred
moneyed hogs.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The S.A. Govt, denies the rumor that Play-
ford is about to resim as Agent-General.
Five provinces of Australasia now float In-
come-tax flags. England has now had an Income
Tax Act for fifty-four years.
Warrnambool Murray, in Yic. Assembly :
“ He was certainly in favor of the reduction of the
number of members of Parliament —(loud Opposi-
tion cheers) —by the abolition of the Upper House.”
(Loud Ministerial laughter and cheers).
For the financial year ended June, 1896,
New South Wales raised £1,825,000 by customs
duties, and Victoria £1,733,000. Which of the
two is supposed to be the great Freetrade province,
by the way? Vue Bulletin really begins to
forget.
The fact that N.S.W. Legislative Assem-
bly has passed a Bill abolishing capital punish-
ment, and that the judgment of the Legislative
Council is not yet known in respect of that Bill,
morally justifies the Executive in suspending the
law in the Dederers’ case.
A member of Vic. Assembly states that he
has closely examined the Leg. Council electoral
rolls and constituencies and finds not more than
150 eligible men in all the province who are pos-
sible candidates for the Upper House as the law
now stands. Eligibility in this connection, of
course, means length of purse.
The promoters of Tasmania’s latest grid-
ironing railway grab —the bars of the said grid-
iron cover 500,000 acres —are “William John
Clarke, Baronet ; Charles Myles Officer the
elder; Norman Armytage ; the Honorable Agar
Wynne; William Hordern ; David Brown ; and
Charles Myles Officer the younger.”
That noisy Tory, Ebenezer Wai’d, M.L.C.,
of S.A., recently wrote to the Register proclaim-
ing his solemn intention to immediately depose
Kingston and his “ motley crowd.” “ The ques-
tion is,” says Ward, “when shall the necessary
war begin ? ” This has already been the question
with the Stomach party for three long years.
Champion asks for suggestions practical
enough to prevent the exodus from Victoria to
W.A. and South Africa. If the Victorian work-
ing men are lions led by asses, as H.11.C. once
asserted, the exodus ought to be a good thing for
Victoria. Or is the army of lions emigrating on
its own while the leaders stay at home and bray ?
At the N.S.W. Land Appeal Court :
The President : “ I think, Mr. Heydon, you will be able
to continue your anrununt so as to avoid the difficulty
Mr. Wise points out.”
Mr. Heydon : “ If you, Mr. President, were conducting
the case against Mr. Wise, you could not help taking up a
ground to which he would object.”
Mr. Wise: “There never was a case conducted like
this, except the case against Crick and Meagher.”
N.: “ Mistake to fetch out the bludgeon
to attack Royalty. The way is to sap and mine,
abolish that solemn prunella creed with sneers.
Ouida. in a recent Forum article, points out that
railways and photographs are enough io reduce
royalty to a clothes-horse. It becomes, like richly-
carven furniture in India, all eaten out from the
inside by ants ; a massive table-leg crunches up in
the palm of your fist.”
A Danish apothecary has forwarded a cure
for the rabbit plague. He sent it to the Governor
of Victoria. “My council is,” wrote the un-
called-for specialist, ‘ get as quickly as possible a
great lot of strong and healthy fox’s, both male
and female, and let them loose in the bush.” As
if Victoria has not already enough “ fox’s.” And
this at a time when Australia is talking about an
export trade in frozen poultry !
N.S.W. Labor-members have now as fine
a chance as they are likely to get of demonstrating
the “ squeezing ” ability which they proclaim to
be their prime virtue. Ten minutes would see the
“ Free ” Education Bill through the Assembly,
but Premier Reid, for several reasons, declines to
afford the time. The Bill has been read twice,
and if the session closes without its being finished
off Labor’s “squeezing ” power will be deservedly
discredited.
The Vic. employment registry offices will
shortly be “dealt with.” A Bill is before Parlia-
ment under which all such offices must be licensed.
License-holders must be people of good repute,
and their premises must be approved by the
Inspector of Factories. The fees to be charged
will be fixed by Government; the scale of fees is
to be conspicuously posted up in the office, and
there are heavy penalties for overcharges, or for
running unlicensed offices. This looks tolerably
right, but there is one thing wanting, as a look at
the New York State law will show. In New York
the fees are fixed by law, the registry-office keeper
is licensed, and no person who,can’t stand inspec-
tion can go into the business. Also, when the
registry man takes a fee from an applicant he must
kind him employment within one month or return the
money. That last proviso is the one which is most
needed in Australia.
Members of N.S.W. Legislative Assembly
should not forget in the hurry of breaking-up for
the holidays that the Upper House has three times
passed measures for reducing the number and
emoluments of the Public Works Committee, and
that the Lower House has each time burked or
evaded the Bill by going into recess.
If an atheistic
paper advocated Bible
reading in State
schools it would be
howled at as blas-
phemous. Similarly
if a democratic jour-
nal suddenly dis-
covered that the
proper law-makers
were peers and sons
of peers, the editor
would probably be
gaoled as a lunatic.
It seems to be the
special privilege of
“respectable” Con-
servative persons and
papers to dissemble
their love for the
people and lie like
Ananias for lucre.
These few remarks are
prompted by the
oldest and most
abjectly Tory rag in
Australasia (estab-
lished 1842) advertis-
ing itself as “an
honest newspaper ”
and claiming to have
advocated for more
than half a century
“Government of the
People, by the People,
for the People.” In
the country afflicted
with this sort of thing
only 7355 electors are
represented in the
Upper House, said
Upper House abso-
lutely controls legisla-
tion, and aforesaid
paper has upheld
the U. H. and all
its works for over
50 years. “Gov-
ernment by the
People ”!! !
When the fate of a Ministry—Freetrade
or Protectionist—is under vote in N.S.W. Legis-
lative Assembly, between 100 and 120 members
almost always find their seats. When the aboli-
tion of capital punishment was put to the vote
last week only 27 of these members cou’d be found.
H. : “ Apply the sexagenarian Civil Ser-
vice retrenchment rule to politicians. After 00
there is not \\ per cent, of a Liberal left amid
them. The most mischievous Tory instrument is
the noble Gladstone, Thiers, Wentworth, Berry,
Parkes, and the like, always described as the ordy
true friend of the people.”
One of the sights in the N.S.W. country
districts now is the old primitive team which
humps goods from Sydney as far out as Dubbo
and Mudgee and Goulburn, and does it below
railway rates. The team has never been quite ex-
tinguished by the railway, but at present it is
having a revival. Men are cheap and horses are
cheap, and imported feed is cheap, which helps to
account for it. Still the spectacle of a huge, old-
fashioned dray facing the awful gradients of the
Blue Mountains as it carries a load of Californian
flour out back seems to suggest that there is some-
thing wrong with the country’s economy.
THE DEDERERS, convicted of the murder, for gain, of an Indian hawker at Boggabri, N.S.W.
A speaker in Vic. Parliament “hoped that
poor and aged selectors would not be troubled by
the Lands office for their rent, as they were
within measurable distance of departing from
this life for a land of greener pastures.” “ Let us
hope,” interrupted Deakin, “ that they won’t find
the green pastures all monopolised. ” Considering
the number of pious Australian squatters who have
pegged-out the matter is very doubtful.
The attempt of Griffith, M.L.A., to make
education free as well as compulsory in N.S.W.,
has apparently come to naught. The school fees
bring in £70,000 a year, and Treasurer Reid
alleges that he can’t afford to part with this money
on any terms. He can’t afford free education ;
but he can afford free newspaper-postage.
HE HLLD THE JOKER.
PARSON : “It is a judgment of Heaven.”
COCKY (who has been burnt out twice): “But I euchred it this time.”
PARSON: “My good man, you cannot euchre the Almighty.”
COCKY: “ Can’t I! I had the darned, place insured.”
Djir Bulletin, —You state that for the
first time the item of hangman’s salary does not
appear in this year’s estimates for Q. It has been
placed, with grim and unconscious humor, in the
Suspense Account. — Spectator.
Another version of the Age of Consent. In
S.A. Parliament a clause in the Licensed Vic-
tuallers Bill penalises parents for sending children
under 15 years of age for liquor. The unhappy
parent who has no children over the prohibited
age will now have to totter to the pub. himself
when he wants a drink, or else perish miserably of
thirst.
C. : Probable that the official ballot-box
used by N.S.W. Lands Department, in ballot-
ing for the determination of applications, can
be so manipulated by turning a knob that the
first marble dropped in will be the first marble to
drop out, no matter how much the box is shaken
and revolved after the other marbles are put in.
By turning the knob, the first marble sticks fast
in a slot, and only a violent bang underneath the
bottom can make it jump up and out. What a
rosy chance of well-paid fraudulent balloting for
a man “in the know ” !
The measure making eight hours the legal
maximum day’s work in mines and factories was
rejected in Maoriland Leg. Council by two votes.
Reasons given : (1) Eight hours is the regular
working day already ; (2) It is evidently going to
continue so ; (3) Therefore the measure is unneces-
sary, also harmful, autocratic, and an outrage on
the liberty of the subject. In other words, the
Tory party first alleged that it made no difference
anyhow, and then got into a frenzy of opposition
that nearly tore the roof off.
Gov. Brassey’s son, just now stumping
Melbourne on the Imperial Federation ticket
thinks that “ when the colonies no longer require
such a large proportion of their resources for the
development of their territory it will not be un-
reasonable to hope that the colonial taxpayer will
stand shoulder to shoulder with the British tax-
payer in bearing the common burdens.” This,
however, is one of the parts of the Hon. T. A.
Brassey’s sermon which doesn’t excite tremendous
applause.
The N.S.W. Government is pushing
through a Referendum scheme to settle deadlocks
between the two Houses. The great deadlock
which looms ahead is over the question of reform-
ing the Council on Democratic lines, and if the
Referendum scheme can be passed then the way
is practically clear. If it is rejected, then it will
be time for Premier Reid to call on Gov. Hamp-
den and state that he wants to send ten more
Liberals to the Council for the purpose of getting
this measure through, and read Neild’s poetry to
him till he gives in.
The proposal now before Tas. Parliament
whereby a syndicate seeks to snavel a thirtieth of
the province and to establish a pre-emptive right
to an area equalling a sixteenth of the total
area of the Land of Sleep a Lot, opens up a ques-
tion of federal interest. Has any province the
right to enter into an agreement which will affect
all the partners to the federation without consult-
ing those prospective partners ? If federal rights
were well considered before union there might be
less trouble over State rights after the wedding.
M‘Lellan/the Dove of Ararat, had a burst
of his old-time energy, the other day, when the
One-Adult-One-Vote Bill was before Vic. As-
sembly. “I would scrape the Ministry off the
benches with a rusty hook”—“ drivelling idiots ”
hairy-faced harridans ” “ dogs ” “ she-
wolves”—“ brazen-faced agitators ” were the most
audible parts of the old man’s oration. But no
one really listens to the Dove of Ararat nowadays.
He has been “ agin everything ” for so many years
in exactly the same wild cuss-language that he is
regarded now as an uninteresting crank, and the
Assembly goes to sleep under his wildest blare of
frenzy.
The point of view makes all the difference.
The Victorian railways lost .£312 last year through
carrying local coal at half cost to encourage the
industry, and the Government promises to go on
doing so for a while longer. And Sydney Tele-
graph, in last Monday's leading article, says that
this is “ a striking illustration ” of how Protection
taxes the masses to support “ influential producing
cliques.” Last year the N.S.W. postal depart-
ment lost about £70,000, a great part of it through
carrying newspapers gratis— which is a lot worse
than carrying them at half rates only—to support
the influential clique which produces the Daily
Telegraph, and what this is a striking illustra-
tion of isn’t even mentioned.
Even the placid, subservient Westralian
Legislature has begun to kick. A little while
ago it actually passed a motion in which it
declared that the action of the British Govern-
ment—in refusing to let Westralia steal the per-
centage of its revenue set aside by the Constitu-
tion Act for the benefit of the province’s wretched
aboriginals, who are rapidly being starved and
murdered into oblivion—was “subversive of the
rights of the people and not calculated to in-
spire confidence.” And that, coming from Perth,
is about the same as if N.S.W. Assembly had
voted that the British Government was a degraded
incendiary, and unfit to carry offal to an illegiti-
mate bear.
Maoriland Parliament dissolved a few dayo
ago, and the question whether Digger Seddon’s
Ministry is good for a third term of office will
probably be settled next mouth. At latest advices
the committee of the Lower House, like that of
the Council, had acquitted the Government of all
the charges made against it re the bank amalga-
mation and the bursting of Treas. Ward, so the
Ass party has lost a convenient weapon. Also,
the State Land Bank is getting along well, so,
apart from the Cold Tea question, it will appar-
ently be necessary for the Tory party to fight the
election on the old-fashioned lines, which consist
in baldly stating that the other crowd is a coarse
hog and a swindler and keeps a harem, and is
given to secret drinking.
The chief interest at the coming M.L.
general elections centres in the Hawkes Bay elec-
torate. Three years ago the alleged “Captain”
Russell, Opposition leader, was elected by a
majority of only 70 votes. The electorate was
ripe for a victory for Govt, candidate Reardon,
when the bull-headed son of John Tanner (the
father of Hastings) nominated his father as Inde-
pendent Liberal during the old man’s voyage from
England. This split the Liberal-Labor vote and
gave the great champion of the Chows and cheap
labor a fresh lease of political life. The moral
effect of the defeat of Russell would be tremendous
—for 17 years he has been the immovable rock of
M.L. Conservatism and the rallying-point of the
reactionary forces; and if “Dictator” Smith
won’t undertake to smash him, the Liberals should
call in a Minister to wipe out the last representa-
tive of the red-blanket system and detested Con-
tinuous Ministry.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The V.R.C. Derby next Saturday must be very
interesting, seeing that the three-year-olds have a more
than ordinary chance of playing principal parts in the
Cup race. The older horses last year were below the
average in “class” and stamina, and youngsters took
them down in big handicaps. Auraria, after finishing
third for the Derby, won Melb. Cup. Wallace, who
carried off the Derby, subsequently won the Sydney Cup,
and only missed the Australian Cup by half-a-head from a
feather-weighted veteran. This year’s lot of old horses
seems exceptionally poor in quality. The crack three-
year-olds of 1895 haven’t trained on, and the top-weight
of the candidates still remaining in the Cup handicap at
time of writing is Preston, a second-class animal. Yet
Preston has a slight show on paper. Probably, then, the
race for this year’s Derby will give such strong tips for
the handicap event that the betting-market will be
revolutionised, and The Bulletin notions, which go to
press a week previous to the Cup, will be despised and re-
jeeted by the man who wrote ’em.
•
Anything that may happen to capture or get
near to capturing the Derby—in smart style and fast
time—is likely to start a good favorite for the Cup. If
the writer had already seen either Resolute, Charge,
Sabretache, Coil, or Reka win the Derby decisively, he
would tip the victorious one to run first or second for the
Cup. Newhaven and The Officer he reckons as somewhat
less likely to stay the two-mile course, although nothing
has been proved against them on that point. Meanwhile,
how is the Derby winner to be spotted beforehand ? New-
haven may have been a brilliant horse in the early spring,
when, by the way, the sensational chestnut didn’t plainly
show that he can stay 1* mile under Derby weight. New-
haven’s performance in the Caulfield Guineas was moder-
ate, and he is suspected of having “ gone off ” since then,
so The Bulletin doesn’t much fancy this onetime even-
money favorite for the Derby. The Officer will undoubt-
edly take the Blue Ribbon, if he can stay the Derby
distance. Of Resolute, Charge, Coil, Reka, and
Sabretache it may be expected that they can all
go H mile without getting “ baked”—the question
is which of them can raise the best spurt at the
end of the gallop. Coil has, perhaps, improved
of late more than Charge, Sabretache or Reka, and Reso-
lute, on his Caulfield Cup form and appearance, is a fine
3 T oungster with poor feet. Moreover, he was greatly
fancied by the stable for the Caulfield Cup, and W. R.
Wilson, a not unduly sanguine owner, considered him “ a
dead bird.” It is unfortunate that Resolute’s chance for
the Derby (and Cup afterwards) will have to be measured
by his feet. Should this imposing colt get along all right
until Saturday, he will be The Bulletin’s champion for
the Derby. Next to the St. Alban’s colt, this journal
swears by Charge, Newhaven, The Officer, and Coil, in
the order given.
• • • • • *•
The first four horses in the Cup will—to the
best of The Bulletin’s guessing belief—include, at least,
a couple of three-year-olds. Take Resolute, Charge, New-
haven and Coil as the most likely ones to supply that
couple, and judge from the Derby running which three-
year-old will be best worth backing for a win and a
‘ place. The Bulletin expects Resolute and Charge to
beat Newhaven, Con, and The Officer in the Cup, pro-
vided that they (the aforesaid Resolute and Charge) have
run among the first four for the Derby. In fact, if Reso-
lute were endowed with ordinary hoofs he would be
worth backingstraightout for the Cup and for the “double.”
Charge, who goes well in his gallops, is certainly worth a
“ place” investment, anyhow.
. . : . . .
Touching the main body of Cup candidates, 4-
year-old and older, some sort of decent argument, ancient
or modern, might be advanced in favor of Devon, The
Skipper, O’Trigger, Marusa, Dreamland, The Merry Boy,
Damien, Trentham, The Chevalier, Nada, Hopscotch!
Disfigured, Bloodshot, and Broken Hill. Something
might be said for every animal in the race, but of the
twenty, or so, possible runners that have not been named
in the foregoing discourse the writer can see no urgent
reason for mentioning any save Tir6, Pivot and Canoona.
The two latter are mentioned merely for the sake of re-
marking that they are bound, on “paper,” to finish close
together, probably half-way between the head and tail of
the field.
Of the selected fifteen (including Tire, who is a
three-year-old, but not a Derby colt) the writer now pro-
ceeds to discard seven—viz., Dreamland, Damien, Dis-
figured, Bloodshot, Broken Hill, Tirfi, and Hopscotch,
of which lot Mr. Bill Long’s large and speedy representa-
tive seems the most likely to run a great race. Hop-
scotch can gallop, and he is very well just now, ana he
ought to finish among the first six. But inasmuch as his
“form” has been brilliant only up to lj miles, and his
impetuosity denotes the non-stayer, Hopscotch shall not
carry the writer’s ss. Bloodshot may win a race at the
V.R.C. meeting, but not the Cup. Disfigured is short of
condition; Dreamland, although looking well just now,
may be expected to fail through weakness rather than
want of pluck ; and Broken Hill—well, all Adelaide swears
by Auraria’s stable companion without attempting to find
reasonable justification for the oath. Broken Hill is a
beautiful horse to contemplate, but his shows in public for
the past two years have been contemptible. Allowing
that his bad leg, which is now strong again, kept him from
being properly wound up until lately, we have to con-
sider that his very best performance would represent
Portsea at lOst. 71b.' in the Cup. That doesn’t look very
tempting, although Portsea was a little wonder at the
time when he gave Broken Hill 371 b. and ran him to a
head. Mr. David James’s seven-year-old may be another
resurrection case, like Cremorne, but itisn t w if.® t( U a ®
resurrection for granted. Should Broken Hill run for
the Hotham Handicap on Saturday his Cup chance will
show itself.
_ ,’ T _ ’ ", . ', . ,
Devon and Nada were both placed in the “4
Cup. They are looking hard and bright this spring and
must be respected in spite of their recent indifferent
running. Skipper, Chevalier, Trentham, O’Trigger,
Marusa and The Merry Boy are stayers, more or less cer-
tain, with some “ form ”to recommend them. None of
them are first-class animals, judged by their performances
up to date, but they are the most likely of all the old
ones, as far as The Bulletin can see, hear, or suspect,
Perhaps Marusa (who has been patiently kept for a coup)
and The Merry Boy will prove the best of these, yet not
good enough to beat the best of the youngsters. The
Bulletin’s tip for the Cup will be Resolute if he wins the
Derby or finishes close behind the winner. Marusa,
Charge and Merry Boy may beat the others. Sensible
people will wait and back the first two horses in the Mel-
bourne Stakes and Derby for places in the Cup.

Without a smile on its pink countenance, Melb.
Sportsman says :—“ The victory of Cremorne has narrowed
down the up-to-date successful pickers of our £lOO Quad-
rliple Coupon (Caulfield Guineas, Caulfield Cup, Mari-
byrnong Plate, and Melbourne Cup) to one.” The lucky
one has Bohemian Girl and Newhaven going for him in
the other two portions of the £lOO Quadruple, so the
Sportsman’s up-to-date risk is about half-a-sovereign. A
bookmaker would bet 200 to 1 against the double—Bohe-
niian Girl and Newhaven. If the guesser had backed his
own selection for twopence—2d. on The Officer would
have given him 16d. to put upon Cremorne-he would
have done much better than by investing a 2d. stamp on
the envelope which carried his coupon to the Sportsman
office. Regrets, however, are useless,

Over a month now since the papers in the

William Lyonel Tollemache-Tollemache, of S
Witham, Lincolnshire.” After which it is a relief
to kn °w that she married a plain “Bill.” And the

very poor second indeed.

a word of welcome for Cohen, J., who takes his
seat Ihe Bulletin will not say his place. At-
torney-Gen Want, for the Bar, both regretted
and congratulated, which made the omission of
their Honors more significant. Also, the Court’s
neglect to welcome Judge Cohen (it had no word
of welcome for him when first he took his seat)
was further accentuated by the ostentatious cor-
diality with which it congratulated Mr. Walsh on
his appointment as Prothonotary.

Bill Martin has written a touching letter to Thf

Everyone knows what trouble there was between
M Donell and myself m Sydney ; and neither of us has
spoken to the other since then. This time, the trouble
occurred in the finish of the final of the half-mile hand;
cap. Coming into the straight M'Donell was leading
with me upon his wheel on the outside I was catching
him; tvvo kicks and I’d have been levei. But at that
instant, he swung out from the middle of the track and
I, in the effort to save myself from a nasty fall, went into
the fence, while M‘Donell’s pedal ripped several spokes

to keep him away, I shoved out my hand. (William must
have ‘ shoved it out sudden ! ’ M'Donell’s impresdon at
the time was that it came out of a gun.) After this I
lodged a protest against M'Donell, and came before the
committee to uphold it, but not one word or si-n was
raised about a protest against me. The first I heard of
my disqualification was on Sunday, coming from church •
it left me used up in three seconds.” This is indeed’

This Saturday’s carnival of N.S.W. Wheelmen’s
mein- 6 tun be great i,ltel ' ,Ja tional event, with A 1
racing. All the cracks are training their hardest for the
big prizes ; Parsons’ good form is evidenced by his lower-

DLle A,i; bt ‘- Up , ata , rare gait; Ken Lewis’ recent Ade-
laide liding is splendid; and Carpenter has just put un a
P reat road-record in Vic. The Orient PllS a 25-mile
race with £1 pacing-prizes for each lap, is a novel and
v\ ell-arranged affair, and calculated to keep the public
interest at enthusiasm pitch. **
As affording a forecast of this season’s racing
form, the Charity Cycling Meeting at Melb Cricket
Ground last Saturday was both interesting and useful
Jimmy Carpenter, winner of the Scott-Morton road-
race, was the hero of the day, carrying off both the T adv
rSTnd ( *3o)’) ’ and ISt a " d 2nd Class" Handicap
(£2<J), and he thus appears to have struck track as well as
road form. Kuhle won a heat with a magnificent spurt
that evidently used up all his dash, for he was badly
leaten in the final; and Pither’s high gear seems to have
lost none of its vigor during the winter. Several novices
allowed their honesty and conceit to get the better of
Ans 1 - 1 'w IS h ret i° n f a 'l d vvon by strcets > knocking out every
possible hope of a big handicap in the Austral and other
caA P ed n off ra th e p S ’firA e 0 HeS vf e ’ the St Kilda Inotballer,
earned off the first race he ever started in, in a style
which proclaims him a coming champion. Stevenson
another new man, won a mile heat by nearly 200yds. ’
When the men tailed out for the final of the
Lady Brassey Handicap, her Excellency herself took up a
position in the centre of the arena, and, grasping a
with both hands, screwed up her face, shut her eves tiVht
rnd pulled the trigger, whereat the’assembled J popuface
cheered vehemently at the brave woman. But themost
touching sight of all was after the race, when Carpenter
ill bare legs, too-tight-fitting knickers, and perspiration’
was led by some loyal person to shake hands with “ Sybil
De Vere ’’ Brassey. He seemed to feel his position keenly.
Parsons dealt it out effectually to his own
world’s grass-record for half-a-mile (lmin. 3 2-ssec.), re-
that quantity by 4 l-ssec. He took 29sec. to turn
off half the distance, as against 28sec., his previous best,
but accomplished the two laps in 59 l-ssee. At one corner
the pace failed, and when leaving the triplet at the finish
Parsons lost several yards ; so it is likely that, had all cir-
cumstances been favorable, he would have brought the
time below the 58sec. which Ziutmerman did on the Exhi-
bition asphalte.
Parsons claims to have grown half-an-inch in
height since leaving ’Frisco six weeks ago. He is now
sft. 6fin., and weighs in condition lOst. 81b.
John S. Johnson, the Yankee crack cyclist, pre-
sented Parsons with a big gold chronometer during his
stay in the States. The Australian had the portrait of his
best girl enamelled on the back. By the way, affaires de
coewr are understood to be not entirely disconnected with
Parsons’ quick return to this country.
Parsons has broken every record that he has yet
tried for.

Restaurant-keepers, near Melb. public offices,
complain that business during the racing carnival is dull,
owing to, civil servants going without their lunches and
putting the money saved on the “ totes.”

Parsons denies using “ the great Australian
adjective.” “ When the American interviewers came at
me, he says, “ I was careful in my speech ; the Anieri-
cans believe that everybody learns the adjective in Eng-
land ; in fact, the Englishman and his adjective are
always bracketed by the Americans. I did not use it, but

London Sketch prints a photo, of a 25-mile

clearness of its detail, removes all suspicion of a “ fake,”
will cause the owner of the photo, of the finish of a cele-
brated protested Melb. horse-race to smile.

There are no appeals from Chief Justice Mad-
den’s opinions on racing- matters, whatever there may be
about his legal decisions. The other day, when a witness
swore positively to a date (12th Jan., ’B9), because he had
pulled off a double at Elsternwick on that date, the Chief
was instantly down upon him to know the names of the
winners, when the witness replied—“ Nectarine and For-

witness on his veracity.

Mick Nathan, the Melb. boxing caterer, usually
“ deals out ” one of his characteristic little speeches to
the Victoria Hall audience on Saturday nights. After in-
troducing the pugs, on one occasion he remarked : “ This
here is going to be a straight go ! If there’s anv gammon
the lads won’t get the money. I tell them that'right here
to show that I like to depreciate my patrons.” Then
the “bashing” began.
One solitary London bobby ejected pug- Peter
Jackson recently from the Tivoli, and Peter’s passiveness
got him off with a fine of ss. only. When Mitchell and
olavin have their monthly “outings” the price averages
£lO each and hospital treatment for anything* over a
dozen “coppers.” Peter sticks to whisky at his own ex-
pense, the other two affect “fizz” at the expense of the
jays, and the results pan out apparently in their proper
proportions.

Stanbury has filled up his interviewers with
a fairly consistent storj'. His making no effort
after appealing for a foul is explained by Jim’s
being mistaken in being sure. Beach, it will be remem-
beied, when fouled on the Thames, made sure by coining’
in first with a swamped boat. And there was no doubt
about Beach’s being fouled, because his opponent’s bow
cut Beach’s leg Beach to-day is greatly surprised at
Stanbury s defeat. “He could row a mile as fast as ever
I could, says Beach.

That defeat of Tom Tracey, the Aus. pug., at
lusco by Green, a pupil of Corbett’s, is another advt. for
Gentleman Jim. What a crowd a battle between Fitz. and
Corbett would draw ! If the einem: tographe wants to
convert Australia into a mint for itself it should secure
the kitzsiminons-Corbett fight before anything in earth
sheol, or heaven. ’

The toughest slugging-matches yet seen in Melb
are for beer; the best pug. at the end of each round gets
a pint. A dog-chewing contest is a love-scene compared
to this sort of thing. r
THE NEW SLANG.
A woman mounted on a bike (by many names we’ve known
her)
Seems doomed at last to take for good the style of “ cvclo-
dona” :
And johnnies “ talking through their necks,” or politicians
boasting,
No longer stand accused of “blow,” the latest term is
“ coasting.”
When Edwin smiles in Angy’s eyes, and can’t misunder-
stand ’em,
The spoony pair, in biking phrase, are merely “ridin<>-
tandem.” 6
Flash drinking cads are “ geared too high,” a parent
stern is taking
“The high wheel” for his title, whilst a chaperone’s
pace-making.”
This cycle craze has bred a name for every brand of ass
type,
And I who write—a cheap machine—must call myself a
“gas-pipe.”

THE ADVANCE OF SCIENCE.
BUT FEW DISEASES TO-DAY THAT
CANNOT BE CURED.
A Well-known Physician Speaks of His Ex-
periments with one of the Most Noted Modern
Medicines.
(From the lowa State Register.)
A few years ago the list of incurable diseases
was a long one, but now, in the age of enlighten-
ment, nothing seems impossible. Diseases which
for years battled the best physicians in the world
set the chemists and wise men thinking, and, as a
result, many valuable remedies were discovered.
First among these remedies stands Dr. Williams
Pink Pills. This medicine was first compounded
by an eminent physician, who used it in his practice
for a. number of years with remarkable success.
Hundreds of reports are received of marvellous
cures effected by these pills. Among the most
noted reports is one from Dr. W. A. Wright, of
Thayar, la., who states that he considered Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People the grandest
remedy he had ever seen. The Register deter-
mined to investigate the report, and a reporter
called up the Doctor on the telephone. As good
luck would have it, he caught Dr. Wright at his
office, and he spoke as follows of his experience
with Pink Pills :
“ They certainly are of great benefit in nervous
diseases of all sorts which afflict both sexes. I re-
member two cases in particular—the ethics of my
profession prevent my giving names—in which the
results were almost extraordinary. In one case a
young man was afflicted with neurasthenia. He
is the son of a doctor who lives in Murray, lowa,
and at last, after his own father could not cure
him, or even give him relief, the poor boy almost
lost hopes of ever regaining even moderately good
health. He was weak and emaciated, his coun-
tenance pale and haggard, and, in fact, was a heavy
burden to himself. Medicines were given, but
they didn’t touch the right spot, and finally Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills were tried, and the immediate
change in his condition was remarkable. An im-
provement was noticed at once, and gradually he
regained his strength and health, until now he is a
strong, robust man, without an ill to bother him.
“ The other case I remember as one that was
very successfully treated was that of a young girl
of thirteen years of age who was suffering from
chorea, or, as more commonly known, the St.
Vitus’ Dance. For five years and a half she had
been treated in vain for this dreadful affliction,
which was gradually but surely taking her
life. When she came to me she was com-
pletely wrecked, and her condition was very
deplorable and pitiful. She was a mere skele-
ton, only weighed sixty-five pounds, couldn’t
feed herself, couldn’t sit on a chair by her-
self, and, in fact, was perfectly helpless. Well,
sir, I tried a number of good remedies, but no im-
provement came, until, finally, I administered
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Soon there was a marked
improvement. Gradually she regained her health,
and now is completely cured and weighs one
hundred and fifteen pounds. I want you to under-
stand that this case was in its worst stage, and
pronounced incurable.
“I have,” continued the Doctor, “used these
pills in many other cases, and have always at-
tained successful results. These two cases I have
spoken of are most extraordinary. ‘ Wonderful ’
is a strong word, but it expresses the results
exactly. I have found the pills a grand cure for
locomotor ataxia, and in all nervous diseases they
certainly are very fine.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are obtainable from all
leading chemists, or from the Dr. Williams’ Medi-
cine Coy., Queen’s Place, Sydney, who will for-
ward (post paid) on receipt of stamps or post order

Irritating and Disfiguring
ERUPTIONS
On the Face, Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Remarkable Experience of Miss Dorothy
Maher, Fitzroy, Victoria, whose portrait
we are privileged to give below:
-
“I take pleasure in testifying to
the great benefit I derived from
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I suffered
from eruptions on my face of a very
irritating and vexatious nature.
For a considerable time I experi-
mented with various so-called blood
medicines, but without any allevia-
tion of my trouble. At last, your
famous Sarsaparilla being strongly
recommended to me, I began to use
it, and after taking two bottles it
was most gratifying to see and feel
the effect in allaying the irritation
and reducing the eruptions. When
I had used three bottles the erup-
tions disappeared altogether, with-
out leaving a mark on my face, and
I have never been troubled with
anything of the kind since.”

“ In every community there are to be found
men who fear to pass through any gate unless
somebody’s great-grandmother has passed through
it before them,” says Max Hirsch.
Two men had a contest, the other day, at
“ pushing down arms,” i.e., clasping hands with
elbows resting on the table. The beaten man felt
something snap, was taken to hospital, and the
inquest showed three fractures of the upper bone
of the arm, due to the spiral twisting to which the
winner had subjected it.
Oil of cedar is a splendid preventive of
mosquitoes and midges, wherefore some wise
Q’sland chemist might do worse than distil it from
the common Australian red cedar (Oedrela toona)
on a commercial scale. It is this antipathy of in-
sects to the oil that caused West Indian cigar-
manufacturers to select cedar for their box material.
The other day out hack a Chinaman was
being conveyed to the grave in a spring-cart which
also carried four live Chinamen, a baked pig,
boiled rice, and the other paraphernalia of a
Chinese funeral. Half way to the cemetery the
horse bolted and spilt the contents of the cart, the
corpse and live Chinamen included. The coffin
broke open, and the corpse fell out —which ghastly
circumstance did not prevent some alleged white
Eersons from taking a permanent loan of the
aked pig during the excitement.
H. : “ The English are surprised that they
could not astonish Chang. The reason is because
he appreciates the supremacy of the spiritual, the
moral and truly religious, over the material. Thus
he finds China beats England, and a mass of sin
is not to be extinguished by railways, telegraphs,
telephones, and electric-light, which, after all, he
doesn’t find to put out the sun’s eye. Same in
India : the people are intensely religious, and the
material English works are only travelling on
earth to reach the stars.”
Every now and again Sydney rock oysters
suffer from a plague which goes through them
even as Asiatic cholera wipes out Mecca pilgrims,
or smallpox devastates mulga blacks. The cause
is now ascertained by Prof. Haswell, of Sydney,
to be a very small annelid (worm) which forms
curious, discolored, more or less sinuous blisters on
the inner surface of the shell. A small blister
seems to do no more harm than a cold in the nose
in man, but a large blistered area kills as sure as
la grippe in a girl with lung-trouble.
Nanism (tendency to dwarfishness) has
been experimentally shown by de Yarigny to be
due to want of activity and movement in the
parent. This seems to some extent to explain why
large, fat mothers so often have undersized child-
ren, whereas little women continually on the move
have families both large in number and large in
height. Facts in this connection should be re-
corded by every country doctor—especially in Aus-
tralia, where a change in type from the Bull to the
Jonathan build is taking place under everybody’s
I eyes. Even policemen have noticed it.
Corpulent people should avoid, and thin,
weedy folk energetically devour, fat meats, starchy
foods, sweets, peas, parsnips, beet, carrots, thick
soups, sauces, cream, milk, cocoa, chocolate, and
similar foods. Vice versa, folk inclined to put on
weight should vigorously take, even as thin folk
should steer clear of, lean meat, poultry, game,
eggs, fish, green vegetables, salads, apples, pears,
tea, and coffee. So stout folk, who mostly run to
liver and kidney troubles, should avoid brandy,
rum, strong whisky, port, stout, sweet fruity wines,
and stick to whisky and tonic-water, gin well
diluted with natural carbonated water, light dry
wines ; the_ converse, of course, being indicated
for chlorotics, ansemics, and other weeds.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline A itality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did

I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre-
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in an acute or chronic case of long
standing, _ where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.

The recent wreck of a shop in Aucklan
(M.L.) by the bursting of a water-main, recalls
the vagaries of a hot mud-and-water geyser a *
M.L. Hot Lakes. One M‘Rae had just got his
newly-built pub. (wooden, of course) hi .e " V
tourists, when, about 10 p.m. on a Sunday, t .
hall-floor heaved and a geyser threw brahngnrad
all round. The company abandoned the ground-
floor, took the contents of the bar upstairs, and
settled down to enjoy themselves Abe deau
>uns ” were placed in three large clothes-baskets
on the balcony, and, when the baskets were filled,
Patsy Dooley, rouseabout, was told to take the
to the kitchen. Half-way down Patsy grew tired
and threw the bottles into the geyser, which made
a fearsome row and, about an hour later, flu g
most of them out with a tremendous roar ot dis-
gust. At daylight the geyser disappeared as sud-
denly as it had come, and MTiae took the ejected
botties, which were lined with a curious filigr ~
work of various colors, and sold them at a big
price as curios. For months after M Rae wen
round the district flinging bottles into the various
geysers to get them turned into objects of vertu ,
but all in vain. It was like the man of the Lost
Drink ” : he could never get a geyser to color his
bottles again.

Extracts from C. H. Bamford’s “ Day in
the Life of a Sewing-Machine Canvasser, read at
a recent Melb. smoke-night :
Full of confidence I stepped up boldly to the door of
the first house in a terrace of eight and rang the hell at
least I would have done so only there was not any bell to
ring, so I rang the knocker instead. The door opened a
little and a head peeped cautiously round the corner >(
“Good morning,” I said, “have you— No. Ihaven t,
and the door banged to. She hadn’t either, for she vas
the dirtiest-looking woman man ever beheld. Not to lie
deterred, after a short wait, changing the method of the
operation, I rang-at least, knocked again-a wait-a foot-
step -the door again cautiously opened, the same head
peeped out—“ Good morning, can I wo, you
can’t,” and the door slammed to. .
It is borne in upon me by this time that I can t, and so
I determine to try the next house. As Idoso I espy a
woman seated upon the balcony. I am so sure she has
overheard the previous conversation that out of veiy
bravado I determine to make her come down or die in the
attempt. Fixing myself m a favorable attitude and tak-
in.r a long breath, I work that knocker tor all it is worth,
then, after an ineffectual cannonade, pause for want of
breath, wait a moment, and then begin again. Still no
response. Just as lam about to make a third assault n
which I will either bring down the knocker, the old
woman, or the house, a voice from above says Did.you
knock ? ” With a fine, withering sarcasm I reply, Rid 1
knock? oh no, not at all,” as I step back, and finding it
evidently beyond my power to force the enemy to come
down, determine to attack from the garden.
“Goodmorning,” I begin—there is much virtue in your
good morning, it is always a politic introduction. Good
morning, can I sell you a sewing machine, one of the
finest in the universe, used by all the crowned heads of
this world and the other, being specially prepared to
withstand a warm climate. Our machines are not only
the eighth wonder, but they virtually embody the seven
others as well. We have 50,000 billion in circulation and
turn out a complete machine every second, that is »
minute, 1000 a day, 10,000 per week, 100,000 per month,
! 20 millions per year.” (This is not arithmetically correct,
but strict accuracy is impossible when you are striving
after dramatic effect.) “ Can I sell you one of our latest;
it is a sort of combination of bicycle and treadmill. The
charges are very moderate ; the agreement certainly does
say something about 2s. 6d. per week, but if you give the
collector eighteenpence during the first twelve months,
and one shilling or one and threepence every two years
afterwards, it will be all right. Can I sell you one ?
All this time she has been, leaning forward with her
chin resting in her bands eyeing me attentively. T)id
you knock?” she asks again. “Bah! I grunt in disgust.
As I turn to leave, a small boy says, “It amt.no use,
mister; she’s as deaf as a post.” There are six more
houses in that terrace, but I have had enough.

In the River.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a heavy, all-night downpour heavy
even for the ever-moist West Coast, where ram
is never prayed for. The three piners—Jones,
Sullivan and Oliver —listened to its patterings on
their tent and rejoiced. They had a cargo of logs
all ready for transport to the sea-board, but an
unusually dry spell had kept the river low. A
flood is the Tasmanian pine-cutter’s waggon,
railway, or lighter —the means by which he gets
his goods to market.
* * * *
Daylight saw it raining as consistently as
ever. The river roared along with a full pressure
of dirt-discolored water —sweeping away logs,
trees, and the varied flotsam and jetsam contri-
buted by the forests through which it took its
course. The men hurried an early breakfast, for
there was work ahead. They were soon at it
clearing and starting laggard logs ; pushing others
clear of the eddies into the run; and averting
threatened “jambs.” Wet, cold work yet ex-
citing for the spice of danger in it. There is a
fascinating wildness in the disorderly procession
of flood-borne logs. Their passage is fraught with
many uncertainties. Now arrested by low ex-
tending arms of the river scrub; now carried
forward by the smooth, swift fresh of the deep
reaches ; on, ever onward, to the mad swirl of
the rapids, over which they shoot erratically, now
hurled right out of the water, and again diving
into the depths; the noise of their contact with
the boulders resounding above the din of waters.
An ever-varying picture of man’s utilisation of the
forces of Nature to serve his ends.
• * * *
About mid-day the party decided to em-
bark in their punts and follow their timber. Rain
was still falling, and the river increasing in
volume. Securing their effects, away they went,
scarcely any pulling being necessary other than to
assist the steersman, whose post is no sinecure
when so much debris is awash.
All went well with them for about half of their
journey—the worst half—till they came to a rapid
at the foot of which a small island divided the
stream. Just as the boat was fairly in the swift
“ run,” at the top of the fall, she grated heavily
on an unnoticed submerged snsg—a sharp and
deadly obstacle which tore the thin planking of
the boat’s bottom as if it had been brown-paper.
In an instant she filled and rolled over, throwing
out her crew, who were swirled forward by the
furious rush of icy water—bruised against the
rocks, and half smothered. Oliver went down
stream for some distance, till at last he managed
to grasp some bushes and pull himself ashore.
The others effected a landing on the island, which
was but a few inches above water. The wrecked
boat was swept clear away.
* * * *
Oliver lay till he regained his breath. Then
he looked round for his companions, whom he had
not seen since the capsize ; he knew that neither of
them could swim. His coo-ees brought no re-
sponse—nor could they have been heard far above
the din of the river. He mounted a small promon-
tory, from which he could see up and down stream
for half a mile or so. On the little rocky islet, sur-
rounded bv the raging torrent, he saw his two
mates. Sullivan was busy about a small log
which some former flood had stranded, Jones lay
apparently inert and helpless—though not dead,
as Oliver first thought. Their position was pre-
carious, as the river was steadily rising. Sullivan,
working with all his energy to get the log clear of
the bushes, was too occupied to notice his mate’s
signals. It was evident that Sullivan meant to
use the log as a means of escape. He carried
his hapless, injured comrade to it and secured
him on the log with strips of shirting and their
leather belts. Oliver waited till the island was
nearly covered, then hurried down stream and took
up a position on a point where the river made a
bend, and stood ready to render assistance—pray-
ing the while that the log would swerve inshore.
* - * *
Presently he saw them coming Jones
stretched out but firmly lashed on ; Sullivan,
stripped to the waist, sat astride, swaying from
side to side in his efforts to keep the rolling thing
balanced, and maintaining his place by holding on
to something which girdled it. Fairly in mid-
stream, the log held its course. Oliver could do
nothing—what could be done ? If it had only run
into the eddy there was a chance, but things were
not ordered so. Sullivan saw him as they swept
past. With a smile on his face, he waved his hand
in farewell, shouting “ Good-bye, old chap. We re
bound ” The remainder was lost. There was
another rapid ahead, and Oliver watched them to
their doom. He saw the log roll over, as, with a
sudden shoot, the resistless waters tossed it on-
ward. He saw it a second or two later with but
one figure on it —him who was tied.
• * * »
At the river’s mouth the workers securing
the logs as they arrived were horrified to find one
bearing a ghastly, battered burden. Sullivans
plan had miscarried, and his last resource was
transformed into a hearse fpr Jones. Sullivan was
denied the poor privilege of “ decent burial,” as he
was seen no more.
The river kept its secret.
Hobart, Tas.
TAHUNE LINAH.
At Mokonui, on M.L. west coast, the other
day, the train started early and left a Maori sal-
vation lass behind. At the next station, a mile
and a half off, that identical wahine, barefooted
and bluchers in hand, leapt joyously into the
guard’s van with “ Hallelujah ! Kapai ! Caught
him that time.” She had chased the train across
the sleepers.
It is interesting to speculate what will be
the issue of the duel when the rapidly-approaching
tick and rabbit meet. They may possibly browse
one on the other, but it is much more probable
thev will become mutually acclimatised the
rabbit helping the tick as a beast of burden, and
the tick clearing the cattle off the rabbit-pastures.
An announcement that the Melb. Presby-
tery had decided to close Chalmers’ Church drew a
sentimental crowd of former attendants to a vale-
dictory service, on a recent Sunday night. Some
among the audience had been present at the
formal opening of the tabernacle 43 years ago,
and these people were visibly shaken up by then
youthful memories rather than by the moderate
sermon provided for their well-seasoned souls.
Yet there was a sense of hollowness about the
closing of Chalmers Church, inasmuch as it seems
pretty certain to re-open shortly under new
management. As a show, it couldn tbe compared
with the deconsecrating of a venerable gospel-mill
that is about to be pulled down. The writer has a
genuinely solemn recollection of a deconsecration
service at the old London church, in Bread-street,
where Milton had been christened. The church
had lost its congregation, and its site was wanted
for another warehouse, and the authorities—who-
ever they may have been, were going to wipe the
dingy edifice off the face of the narrow little
Bread-street. When they pulled it down, and
the slip of the churchyard came to be dug up,
the writer bought a human bone from one
of the workmen for the price of a pint
of beer, and duly soliloquised over the fragment of
forgotten mortality—but this is a digression. A
small crowd of decrepit softgoods potentates—the
street where Milton was born and christened is
full of ’em—came to hear the last sermon preached
by a parson as old as themselves. The octoge-
narian in the pulpit reminded these city pa-
rishioners of their younger days, when they were
comparatively poor and lived on the small pre-
mises which had since blossomed into big pre-
mises, the days long before they thought of
dwelling in gorgeous suburban residences, and
when they had “worshipped,” as the parson put
it, every Sunday within these rather shaky walls
where he was now addressing them for the last,
last time. And the bloated capitalists wept as
one man. Their hearts were touched, probably
by thoughts of how they once intended to give
away lots of money when their businesses in-
creased, and hadn’t done so after all. Anyway,
tears fell freely. The present writer s white-haired
boss was among the weepers, and as soon as he
had tottered mournfully back to his private office,
the p.w. made a fervent appeal for more salary
and didn’t get it. The old alligator said he was
too sad to discuss such matters.
The Salvos’ Error.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The hallelujah lass married the man because she
had converted him, and supposed she loved the re-
claimed lost sheep. The man married the woman
because he loved her. His was love; hers was
frenzy, such frenzy as all earnest religion is. But
the ill-assorted pair went the way of all such
couples. The good woman behaved as good
women do, and that is devilishly bad to the bad
man. Instead of being a crown to her husband
she was a shining-light and a tambourine in the
Army. She did not swear at him, she did not
drink, she threw no crockery ; but with due meek-
ness she nagged him off to Western Australia,
and when he was dry-blowing and drinking mud
she was yelling “Come to Salvation !” at street
corners.
Then came the find, and the find was for her and
for love. The love had never slackened on the
part of the man, and it never existed on the side of
the woman.
The return was not a triumph. The bank
deposit-receipt was not a heart-plaister, and the
welcome was only “How is your soul?” But
there was now a third party to be consulted—a
baby, in fact, and that ought to have been a bond
of love. I don’t believe the female thing loved
even that healthy squalling consequence.
What could the fellow do ? Follow her about to
the knee-drills and prayer-wrestles, or sit at home
and mind the kid? He was rich now, and could
pay a nurse ; but the other half said that was
pride and sinful. So he sat and went out to have
a drink. This was on the evening of a house-to-
house drink crusade. His wife crusaded him, up-
braided him, and held him up to scorn before the
man with the big mouth and drum, the girl with
the little mouth and trumpet, the captain with the
badly-fitting cap and sympathy, and herself with
her ghastly features and religion. The end was
rum. It began with a small beer and a smoke.
When the fire-bell rang in that one-horse Cen-
tral Queensland township the tambourine was
preparing a solemn warning without a drop of
mercy or love in it: a lot of hell and no chance of
heaven; a cry for repentance forgetting self-
righteousness. But there was no one to warn, not
even the baby. She could not well warn ashes.
SCOTTY THE WRINKLER.
The peculiar aroma of rum depends largely
upon the treatment of cane-juice in the boiling
house, and the action of a peculiar kind of bottom
yeast, known to chemists as “ 16T8 ” yeast. The
Trinidad growers are now specially using this,
and competing with the very finest Jamaica quali-
ties. Queensland makers should note this.
Maoriland Leg. Council has thrown out
the bill fixing a maximum legal rate of interest,
and the National Option Bill has gone overboard
along with it. Therefore, Seddon’s proposals for
further liberalising the Council will probably get
him many votes at the election, and destroy any
flickering chance the Ass party might otherwise
have possessed. The blank incapacity of the Ass
party is shown by its conduct on this occasion.
Its members are mostly placid old landlords, not
usurers, and the abolition of usury idea would
have done it very little personal injury. As for
national option, it should have, made it easier,
instead of throwing difficulties in the way, and
amended the bill so as to allow of the shutting, up
of every pub. in Maoriland on a bare majority.
Then if the Government objected it would have to
kill the measure itself, and lose the Cold Tea vote
for ever, while the Tory faction would get the
Cold Tea support without paying anything for it.
And if the Government accepted the amended
scheme, and the Cold Tea regime did arrive, and
the Seddon Government had to find the money to
supply the missing drink revenue, and burly
Richard of Kumara couldn’t get. a whisky for
love or money, and the great Public Thirst began
to rise in revolt against him —well, the Ass party
could lie back and brush the flies off itself with its
ears, and smile. It would have run Seddon into
the worst hole of his life, and left him there, and
it would have the credit, while he would have the
worry and the deficit and the anguished bald spot
on the top of his head and all the other miseries.
In the Bight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a trifle of a thousand leagues of sea
And an immaterial million reefs or so
At her ending on the shore that lies a-lee ;
And from there a sweep clean to the Bole below.
There’s a vagrant gale that never yet was born,
Nor has died nor started, but has always blown; 1
And it whoops around a ship in noisy scorn,
And slings a thousand-tonner like a stone.
And that’s the Bight—the very large, important,
useful, great Australian Bight—
Four hundred feet of deck
Is no bigger than a speck,
And the coaster it's quite proudful on the big Aus-
tralian Bight.
The Bulimba there’s as good as any Rome ;
No more a coaster when she walks the Bight ;
She’s an ocean-goer once she lifts the foam
That runs a mile-race from the Borda light.
Damn all trusting to her Brisbane river berth !
Blast all warping on the Yarra’s greasy tide !
A skipper west feels that he owns the earth,
And he steams the Bight with large amount of
side.
On the Bight—the extremely wide and popular
and great Australian Bight.
The wave that makes her roll
Has been booked straight from the Polo,
Through a thousand leagues of ocean on the big
Australian Bight.
The coasting-ships will cross that bight for years
Though the wild-cat man may say the West is
done ;
The westward freights are answering his fears,
There’s a cargo-glutton underneath the sun.
Freight of stampers, freight of cattle, freight of
steel,
Ebbing westward through the day and by the
night,
Loaded downward from her decking to her keel,
’Twarn’t for nothing God Almighty dug the
Bight— .
The Bight—the marvellous, only genuwine Aus-
tralian Bight.
It was dug to float the best
Of the East unto the West,
And it’s floatin’ ’em unceasingly ’s the big Aus-
tralian Bight.
So those Easterners go westward mostly broke ;
They return with slugs and buy the worst of
wine ;
But the coasting skip.—contented sort of bloke !
Would rather trench that great big field of brine.
And he lifts old Breaksea Island with the sun,
And leaves the Bight next morning with regret,
For the older Indian Ocean and the run
Up to the Leu win ere the sun has set —
Leaves the Bight —the ample, generous and safe
Australian Bight.
If a bigger sort of gale
Laid her over to her rail,
She’s got the room to wear in on the big Australian
Bight.

Editor Bulletin, — Be old-age pensions.
It is true that outside cities there is no employ-
ment for elderly men. The free selectors never
employ such men, and the managers of bank-
owned stations simply dare not have an old man
on the place. Those of them who remain in the
bush begging are in the long run usually found
dead in the old huts. Ninety per cent, of the
armies of all countries are composed of men who
care not a bit for the country they serve under,
and would not be soldiers if they could obtain em-
ployment which would suit them better. The
scum of all cities and countries can be found in
the army. If those soldiers are entitled to pen-
sions, how much more so are the pioneers of our
goldfields and our back-country, the brave and
reckless army who have endured all sorts of
privations in developing resources of a country
wherein they only too often find themselves pau-
pers in the end. Blow, Australians, and let your
father die in the ditch !— Experience.


In Central Australia on the Finke River
the only clothes worn by a warrior of the Larapinta
tribe are a waistband and a necklet woven out of
his mother-in-law’s hair in token of her total subjec-
tion to him. And yet- Australian blacks are
accused of being men of low intelligence.
Chief Justice Madden attributes the deca-
dence of Egyptian civilisation to —
The corruption, vice, and loss of elevating principle
which ensued upon the abandonment of the ancient re-
verence of its people for their gods and their worship.
More confounding of effect with cause. Egypt
lost her reverence for her gods only when the good
gifts of the gods were monopolised by a few. She
went down because some citizens forgot that
others had citizen-rights. Split historical straws
as we may, the downfall of almost every civilisa-
tion can be explained by the aphorism: The
many had little, the few had much.
Premier Seddon is promoting a National
Option law whereby a teetotal majority, if such a
thing can be found in Maoriland, will have the
power to shut up every pub., and presumably
every brewery, in the three islands at one wild
swoop. And still the Cold Tea crowd is against
Seddon because he refuses to introduce a Prohibi-
tion Bill. That crowd desires two separate runs
for its Cold Tea. It wants National Option in the
first place, so that it can shut the pubs, if the popu-
lar majority is with it. And if the majority is
against it in the country it wants its majority—if
it can get one—in Parliament to pass a Prohibition
law in defiance of the majority outside. And as
Dick Seddon won’t help to make the required
majority in Parliament, he and the teetotal crowd
don’t drink amicably together these times.
Puncher : “ And, pray, who is your
correspondent ‘ Mahlstick,’ the superior per-
son who, having ‘been unable to tolerate Du
Maurier, ’ considers that the author of ‘ Trilby ’ is
‘no loss to the London Charivari ? ’ I can’t speak
of Du Maurier’s recent work, for I haven’t seen
half a dozen copies of Punch since 1883, but I can
remember the time when his drawings were in-
valuable to the paper. As an illustration of sas-
siety airs, graces, fans and crazes for the amuse-
ment of the British world in general, Du Maurier
had no rival for a long time. Moreover, he was
(one presumes) an original satirist, and a creator
of charming nursery humour. I take it that the
man who subsequently wrote ‘ Trilby ’ was the
author or polisher of most of the jokes he illus-
trated. Perhaps they were not sufficiently good
jokes to get toleration from ‘ Mahlstick,’ but to
me they seemed delicately pointed. Anyhow,
some of them have been sticking in my memory
these twenty years, during which long period I’ve
forgotten all the texts that I ever saw attached to
the work of his artist contemporaries, and every
drawing that illustrated them.”

To Sleep ! Perchance to Waite :
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sometimes the dull dream of the mono-
tonous, everyday round of a man’s life fades, and
the man wakes, lor one moment the present is
torn from him, and he is face to face with t
past. The days when he lived are with him again
for one agonising moment, ere the sleep and the
him as befoie.
m . * ,
There was a grizzled clerk in a lawyer s
office in sleepy Hobart. He had worked there
quietly and steadily for over twenty years, yet no
man, woman or child but knew him for the ex-
convict that he was. Phis did not trouble him,
except now and then, when he awoke, half-
blinded by the light of other days. To one man
only—his employer—was his whole story known.
* * * *
Love is no respecter of persons, and when
the articled clerk, working in dirty, picturesque
Dartford, fell in love with the only daughter of
one of the richest squires in Kent, the strength of
his passion made him feel that it must overthrow
every obstacle. The chief obstacle was the squire,
He was a fierce-tempered man ; he also held pro-
nounced ideas as to the total submission of a child
to its parent’s will, and the necessity of marrying
in one’s own station. To him there seemed little
difference between the penniless articled clerk and
any other ’prentice boy. He would see her in her
coffin, he told his daughter, rather than sanction
her marriage to one so much beneath her.
1 he girl trembled at Ins words, but, neverthe-
less her rides took her to the little dip on the
wide expanse of health, where she knew young
Richard Hamilton would be awaiting her. She
loved him intensely, though her dread of detection
grew to the terror of a nightmare.
One day she came with white lips.
“I can’t stay,” she said, “my father suspects
something. I know he does. He says he will
ride with me in future. O, Dick ! what shall we
do ? ”
Her kiss sent the burning blood surging through
him. He feared nothing as he comforted her and
watched her ride away.
* * * *
Each night, when the house was dark and
still, a silent figure stole down the stairs and
softly raised the iron bar of the library shutters.
Each night the ecstasy of meeting thrilled the
young lovers as in hushed voices they talked of
all that was coming, but sometimes, even while
he whispered confidently of the time when their
happiness would be complete, the girl would shiver
and turn pale at imaginary sounds.
.* * * . . *
One night, while he stood waiting outside
the closed shutter, a window opened softly above
him, and he caught his name like a sign in the
breeze.
“ Dick ! Dick ! I can’t come down. My father
is not in bed yet. Good-night, dear Dick, and go
away.”
“ Not without a kiss, if I break my neck over
it,” he whispered back, while he seized the thick
ivy-trunk in his hand. He was on the window-
siiJ, and for an ecstatic moment his arms were
round her. Then the door burst open, and the
hard face of the old squire, contorted with rage,
was before them. The young man could easily
have escaped in the same manner as he came, but
he was no coward, and his heart was full with the
innocence and strength of his love. He slipped
to his feet and stood upright. The old man with
an oath ordered his daughter from the room, and
in the look of suspicion and bitter hatred that
accompanied the words her lover read that which
seemed to make his heart stand still.
By the love he bore her, by the chivalry in his
young heart, he knew now that, whatever might
happen to him, for the honor of her name his lips
must be sealed.
In a dazed way he watched her as she crept away
in terror. He now felt stunned, unable to think
or speak. _
At the squire’s call the men-servants rushed in,
the nearest constable was summoned, and on a
charge of house-breaking the young man was fet-
tered and led away.
* * * *
It was very annoying to “my Lud ” that
the delivery of his nicely-rounded periods, em-
phasising tlie results of youthful depravity and
evil courses should be interrupted by a disturbance
at the far end of the court.
A girl, hatless and dishevelled, was struggling
with the guardian of the door, sobbing and trem-
bling with wild eyes fixed on the prisoner.
“ Dick ! ” she cried, “he locked me in. I tried
so to get out. O Dick, I broke through the win-
dow and fell.” She stretched out her little bleed-
ing hands, but the policeman’s grip was on her
arms. “Let me go to him,” she screamed, strugg-
ling wildly—“ I will go to him.” The Judge had
recovered from his surprise and spoke the last
words of the sentence. The girl ceased to struggle,
and the words echoed through a silent court.
“ Penal servitude for fourteen years.”
Then silence came again. The prisoner’s eyes
were fixed on the court-house door. His breath
shook him as it came and went. And then the
silence was broken. A loud shrill cry from a girl’s
lips filled the air, and was followed by peal upon
peal of mad laughter. The people shuddered as
they rose to their feet, but the laughter still went on
till the walls rang, and in the street it echoed
still, as the police carried out a hopeless maniac.
* » * *
For a space the floor seemed to shake
under the grey-haired man’s feet. He pressed his
hands to his head, while his whole existence
seemed to him one passionate cry for death and for
oblivion. For a moment. . . . “I want those
conveyances made out as soon as possible.”
“ Very good, sir,” said the clerk, as he took up
his pen once more.

Some years ago a certain struggling sub-
urban bank-clerk began to draw on the till to meet
his pony-racing losses. He was £9OO short when
the inspector loomed on the horizon. A day or
two later the Easter holidays also came and,
taking advantage of the four clear days ahead, the
man of subtractions decided upon a trip abroad
with as much ready cash as the safe then con-
tained. This resolve he carried into effect, and
was safe on the seas when the shortage was dis-
covered. Months passed and he gravitated to
London to play up the balance of his capital, to be
then recognised and transhipped to Australia,
-where three years’ hard awaited him. Released
by good conduct before the nominal expiration of
the sentence, the. erstwhile embezzler made his
way to Westralia, and getting into the Govt, ser-
vice under an assumed name became a highly-
esteemed officer. One day, however, his identity
became known, and next morning Mr.—“ Smith ”
—failed to appear at his accustomed desk. Coolgar-
die had just then broken out, and thither the re-
signed civil servant wended his way, picking up
enough money in promiscuous deals to take him to
London once again. At the big smoke three years
back anybody with practical Westralian experi-
ence held four aces, and after a six months’ sojourn
the erstwhile bank-clerk returned to the salty
city, his every pocket bulging with commissions.
He blossomed out in his old residence as the
representative of influential English syndicates,
and played his cards so well that not long ago lie
shook the dust of the Australias from his feet for
good, and started off to settle down in New York
or somewhere with ,£30,000. He is now firmly
convinced that honesty is the best policy, and
strongly ad vises any young man that floating com-
panies is a far better business than falsifying
accounts.
Pita.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“And now, Peter, my dear lad, do try and do
better. I am certain your father ”
“Step-father, mother.”
“Your step-father will relent and find some-
thing for you to do when you come back if only
you do well when you are away. Try to deserve
his good opinion, Peter; and, Peter, remember
Nellie Cameron. That girl loves you. Don’t
break her heart, my boy, and mine, too, by taking
up with any of those dreadful black women down
there. Now, there—good-bye—my dear —good-
bye.”
The intervals were motherly kisses. Mrs.
M‘Neil moved off wet-eyed. The girls, Peter’s
sisters, were laughing. They knew Peter. Also,
they enjoyed the covert glances of the sailors and
the wharf-loungers. They were well-fed, full-
blooded animals —like their affectionate brother
Peter. Presently they went ashore and joined
their mother. The steamer backed out and
steamed down Sydney Harbor.
Peter was a good fellow but a bad worker. He
had been bank-clerk, police-trooper, professional
footballer and billiard-marker. Now he was going
via Fiji to Raratonga with =650, his step-father’s
parting blast, and an appointment to boss a small
cotton-plantation.
Peter fell into the work capitally. It was good
fun bossing the docile Maoris. Enough rum and
gin for home consumption could always be ullaged
out of the stores, the living was good, there were
plenty of pigs, fowls, and fish, even if there was no
beel. And then there was Kuanini.
Kuanini was Pita’s Raratongan wife. Tall,
handsome, and full-figured, she had caught and
been caught by the stalwart young Sydneyite
before he had been a week on the, island. The
kikos had allowed him the usual fling after he took
Eossession, and then told him he would have to fix
is attention on one. Pita found out the alterna-
tive was a fine of ten dollars for every amour that
he might be detected in— and chose Kuanini.
His choice was good. She was a princess, and
regally resented any other woman’s admiration of
her rangatira pa-pa.
“Pita ! kahauri tu-tai t’ waihini,” and Pita, as
yet satisfied with his choice, forbore to speak to
any other woman.
But he wearied by-and-bye and went sailing
with Capt. Knuckleduster Johnson to Aitutaki,
an island 80 miles from Raratonga, famous for its
complaisant female population.
Johnson and Pita went ashore to find the most
uncompromising missionary that ever the society
sent out reigning the island. All transactions
must be in the market, and every sailorman, cap-
tain, passenger or deck-hand afloat before night-
fall. Ships must land no grog, and foreigners
parley no women under penalty of the calaboose.
Johnson knew all about this, so he sold cheap
and got all the women around him. What he
said m itters not, but late that night a boat landed
the captain and his passenger at a place where two
buxom Aitutaki girls stood waist-deep in the
water of the lagoon. Each taking her lover on her
back the pair walked backward over the sand of
the beach so that their tracks would confound the
vigilant kikos.
Now it happened that Johnson’s pilot was
Kuanini’s brother, and he, noticing Pita’s
nocturnal absence, quietly informed the vigilant
representative of the British Missionary Society.
This gentleman told the kikos, and the result the
next night was, as the two girls carried their live
loads back-stepping up the track, down swooped
the kikos armed with knives and clubs and cut
and pounded the Englishmen to a state of
insensibility. Johnson, wire-framed animal as he
was, recovered sufficiently to sail away in his
schooner. But Pita, handsome Pita, the women’s
pride, was inaeke—he would never be a sound man
again.
A steamer is landing her passengers at Rara-
tonga. They include those uncommon items,
white women. These are Mrs. N‘Neil and her
orphaned protege, Nellie Cameron.
They meet Maivenua—“ such a sweet girl,”
Miss Cameron says—a sentiment every male Euro-
pean visitor could endorse. “Ai, I tshow you
Pita.”
She leads them to the white-painted house and
enters. On the floor, in clean white suit, lies
Pita, his head on the lap of Kuanini, who has
been giving him some poi, ripe bananas mashed
with cocoa-nut juice.
His face meets his mother’s with a vacant gaze
and wanders to Miss Cameron’s. No gleam of
recognition is in his lustreless eyes. The kikos
that night on Aitutaki beach have taken away his
memory.
The white women are in tears. The big Maori
woman looks up—“ You no tak Pita? ”
“ No, my girl,” says Mrs. M‘Neil. And she did
not.

Mr. Alfred 0. Jolliffe, of Granville, So. Australia, whose portrait we
give above, writes :
“I used Aver’s Sarsaparilla in England for years before coming to
Australia At times I was much troubled with boils and- other eruptions
of the skinf caused, the doctors told me, by the running down of my
svstem and general debility. The only medicine that has ever done me
lasting good is Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, which has always cured me—purifying
my blood, and giving me new life and health and vigour.
The wonderful success of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in purifying the blood and
restoring health and strength to systems enfeebled by disease, or the enervat-
ing effect of a warm climate, has led to the placing on the market of other
preparations called Sarsaparilla. Remember that
form of flattery, and be sure that you get AVER S SARSAPARILLA
which has stood the test of time, has won the highest awards at the world s
great expositions, and has been a blessing to the people of Australia, and
all civilized countries, for more than a generation. No other medicine operates
so effectually in removing general debility, languor, and all outward symp-
toms of the grave mischief caused by disordered nerves and impure blood.

An Impossible Motion.

Sergeant William Sullivan is up to
something—he is up to the wall, upright
to the wall, right up to the upright wall.
It is a queer position for a real live ser-
geant ; it looks a painful one, but he does
not show his face—that would tell a tale.
He is laughing, although he is straining
every nerve to keep his equilibrium. It
is not because Sergeant Sullivan is a
giddy man that he makes this attempt to
lean sideways straight up to the wall.
Neither does he try it because there
is no convenient lamp - post to em-
brace. The fact is, he was offered
Five Pounds if he could do it, and, as
the picture shows, he attained the
desired position, but he didn’t attain the
desired Prize, for we were inquisi-
tive, and found out the Old Soldier
dodge. He had a nail on his finger—
an iron one—and driven into the wall.
That wasn’t in the piece, so Sergeant
Sullivan retired, and he says, “ You
can’t pull the breeches off a High-

cAri I ? ea s a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I desire to
, es t™ony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating cough, with much ex-
J / * ave olm<: .'t to be the most effectual of anything I have tried. It loosens tire mucus,
wmcn, therefore, comes more readily away, and the cough is thereby considerably pacffied.
Yours respectfully, "THOMAS STOKER.
