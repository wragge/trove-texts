The Red Page
The Lost Pen.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He made a song and lost his pen;
And a pen is the word of God to men;
For how should a bird and a laughing tree
And the voice of the stream and the song ot'
the bee
Live for a charm except they drink
Through a quill or reed of the dreamer's ink:
Never, oh, never a goose came by
With a grey wing-feather for thought to fly;
And many and brown were the river weeds,
But the sun in the ripples had stolen the
reeds.
Woe aua alas ! And how should it be
With a singer below a great, green tree,
With a thought in his hat and a smile on his
lips
And a bushel of words in his finger-tips?
The wi’en went out and built his nest
In, the dimpling leaves he loved the best.
With strips of bark he thatched it brown
And bedded it soft with thistle-down;
And he counted the eggs and found them
eight
And sang a song of his heart’s desire —
“Summer is come and the brood is late
And the sun comes up like an egg of fire!”
He counted the eggs and found them ten —
“Oh, blossom and seed!” sang the yellow-
breast wren....
And the singer of dreams had lost his pen.
Needles of brown were a carpet spread,
And the she-oak shade was over his head,
While the stream went spraying the drip-
ping fern
Down by a pathway of mossy stone —
How should the hot world hear and learn
The wise, sweet word of its falling tone?
Higher and higher like sunlit gems
The small bees flashed in the gum-tree
stems,
Carrying honey with never a sting,
Bach flight too glad for remembering.
But how should the hurrying people know
Down in the clattering streets below
Of the hive in the tree and the tree in the
glen
When the singer of truth had lost his pen?
A thousand stars went through the trees
And out of the moon came a lilting breeze.
What did it sing? What did it sing?
Jewels set in the night’s wide ring
This way and that as the great trees swayed
A song that was more than a song had made.
Listen and listen !. .. . The song of men
Out of the aeons ringing and ringing.—
But the listener of stars had lost his pen
When the voice of a thousand nights was
singing!
Lady white of morning laughter
Under an archway of climbing green—
Mark how the falling rose runs after
The trailing dress of a singing queen!
Queens have gifts in both their hands.
Treasure-laden where she stands,
What shall be her gift to him
Who dreams with all his soul abrim,
Drinking sweets and sight and song?
0 Lady Queen, the wine is strong
That gives his heart so fast a beat.
Draw near, draw near on shining feet;
For all he drank in voice and dew
And trees asleep and stars awake
Was you and you and always you,
Because the living world was true
And singing only for your sake!
Oh, gifts are yours to hold and give—
The dreams by which a man may live—
And still the holiest gift is this,
The blossom of your lips to kiss.
Three white petals on her hair,
The young sun laughed to see her fair.
Lest life and death should fall amiss
She dowered him with a perfect kiss....
O Queen! O World ! O nesting wren!
The silent singer found his pen!

DAVID McKee WRIGHT
Three Singers
Revolt, by Alexander G. Steven (McKellar
Press, Malvern). This is a book of even,
well-turned verses which do not say a great
deal nor say it with any remarkable fresh-
ness, but may give a good deal of pleasure
to those whose reading follows the well-
marked trail. Here and there are excellent
lines, and it is hard to find a really bad
line. But it is equally hard to find an un-
expected phrase or a trace of any emotion
except the one authorised by custom and
tradition to appear at that exact spot. “The
Iiping of Pan,” with its quick movement
which trips on the last line, seems to just
miss. The words all appear to be in order,
but they have not created an atmosphere.
In the sonnet on Keats the octet closes with
the rather 'fine lines :
And his caged dreams found radiant utterance
In music perilous with all desire.
But the sestet falls away and the general
effect is only fair. Much of the work has
a pleasing delicacy, as in “Threnody”:—
Blow gently, winds, above her grave:
Stir not the flowers harshly: wave
The grasses gently: do not rave.
Her life was gentle: yield to her
A gentle music: through the fir
And flowers and grasses softly stir.
Though the sharp breaks rather mar it,
that has a quiet music. But why “fir”?
The fir is a very scarce vegetable in Aus-
tralia ; and it seems a pity to have to shift
the whole tomb to Europe to find a rhyme.
The opening lines of the book sound like
business
Within my heart adventure stirs—
O God! to break all barriers.
But the verses are not adventurous in any
sense; and the title “Revolt” is about the
last that should have been chosen. Alexander
G. Steven is the author of several other smail
volumes, and to a point he has learned the
verseman’s craft. Ilis present and pressing
need is something to say.
The Road to Muritai by O. N. Gillespie
(Wright and Jaques, Auckland). Here is
work that is vital and with a pulse in it.
Gillespie has not done much in verse, but
what he has done show's a strong originality
and freshness of treatment that give pro-
mise of bigger things. “Earth Music” is a
grim, powerful piece. In it the hill rejoices
over the struggling cultivator and the mort-
gage rejoices over both. In some of the
lightest verses he is remarkably happy: —•
Sing a song of washing-up—shining clean plates
Chattering together like a crowd of old mates:
Buxom cups and saucers and little white bowls
Purely and demurely bright like little girl souls. •
And this is altogether charming and some-
thing more: —• ,
0 babe of mine,
I know not templed priest nor sacrament,
But in your eyebrow’s tiny trembling tent
I build mv- shrine,
And, kneeling, hear God laugh in glad assent.
All the work is good; and it seems a pity
there is no more of it. Take this from
“Flowers of War” :
A daisy bowed its head
Vainly to hide its shapeless, bloodied spots
From eyes of jubilant forget-me-nots—
Forget-me-nots of red.
But, checkered on the sod
Among the flowers, stood rows of crosses white.
They wove no red: they flamed with living light—
The glory-gold of God.
Every lover of good verse should have a copy
of this booklet. It is not a far guess that
it will be a rare treasure at some not dis-
tant future. Its value is not enhanced,
however, by the page of photographic blocks
of Muritai. Gillespie is Muritai’s chief
claim to honor, but it needn’t get between
the reader and a glad half-hour.
Songs of Cheer by Ellie Wemyss (G. Has-
sell and Son, Adelaide). It is hard to
guess who is likely to be cheered by these
rather loud commonplaces. Most of the
verses in the volume are as good as those of
“God Save the King.” The booklet is ex-
cellently produced.
Japan's Place in the Sun
One of these days the U.S.A. may sit
down and count up the cost of its tardiness
in entering the war. It stayed out so long
that the Allies were driven to do things
which may yet have the most serious con-
sequences to the world in general and per-
haps to the U.S.A. and Australia in particu-
lar. Had America taken its place among
those who were fighting the world’s fight for
democracy, Japan at any rate would not
have squeezed out of the Allies the agree-
ment with regard to Shantung—an agree-
ment of which they were so ashamed that
they did not tell the U.S.A. about it until
the Peace Conference had been, actually
opened. That agreement is one of the
weapons used by the Republicans in
their attacks upon the Peace Treaty,
which embodies its provisions. We are
ashamed of it. But the question is whether
the U.S.A. should not be rather more
ashamed of itself for having stood out of the
fight so long that the people who were on the
side which the U.S.A. afterwards took were
driven to such desperate measures. For the
Shantung agreement and all that it implies
the responsibility rests at least as much upon
the U.S.A. as upon Britain and France, who,
for want of the U.S.A.’s backing, were driven
to bow their heads to it.
That grab at Shantung was part of
the general movement with which Dr.
Arthur Judson Brown deals in The
Mastery of the Far East (G. Bell
and Sons, London). Dr. Brown is one of
the leading spokesmen for American foreign
missions; and he can’t forget for five minutes
at a time that his missions must have the
goodwill of the people among whom they
work. This makes the large, ponderous vol-
ume an unsatisfactory guide. For if Dr.
Brown is driven by overwhelming evidence
to find the accused guilty of cattle-stealing,
he immediately gets into the box and gives
evidence that he knows the accused to be
very kind to dogs and is quite sure that he
intended to be a foster-father to the stolen
bullocks. Still if you leave all that out
there is plenty left on which to make up
your mind that Japan has ambitions to
which it sets no limits. It was the war with
Russia which first set those ambitions soar-
ing. Japan wanted Korea, and Russia stood
in the way. Japan prepared itself to contest
the path. And it won, though by much less
than it got the world to believe. Finding
itself in Korea, of course it noticed that the
people were desperately in need of an uplift;
and equally of course Japan proceeded, as a
matter of moral duty, to supply it. That
was the beginning of the end of Korea’s
independence.
But Korea was, so to speak, merely taken
in Japan’s stride. Says the Japophile
Brown:
The yellow race was beginning to view with
alarm and irritation the aggressions of the white
race, which controlled vast and populous regions
in Asia. Manchuria was already Russian. The
great province of Shantung (China) was virtually
German; and if Korea were also to fall into the
hands of the Slav the consequences to Japan would
be dire. A formidable barrier would be erected
between the Japanese and Chinese , and Japan would
be shut into the narrow confines of her islands.
So Korea was taken. Then Japan seized
the chance offered by the distress of the
Allies to get'control of Shantung. And “the
formidable barrier” between Japan and
China disappeared.
That brings China into the picture; and
always behind China is Japan—Japan in a
thousand forms; but always Japan striving
for the mastery of “the East.” Japan was
the Ally of Britain and France; neverthe-
less it used all its efforts to keep China
from joining and strengthening the alliance.
Dr. Brown not only admits it, but confesses
why—
Japan preferred to deal with China herself....
Japan did not care to have China’s financial position
strengthened by European loans. Nor did Japan
care to have China given a voice round the council-
table of nations where the disposition of the prov-
ince of Shantung, and perhaps Manchuria, might be
considered.
That was the extent of Japan’s love for the
Allies! Besides, it wanted to go to the
Peace Conference the sole spokesman for
“far” Asia. And it had so arranged mat-
ters that, in this plan, for all practical pur-
poses, it won again. China was there, but
so pathetic a figure that Japan’s triumph
was greater than if it had been there alone.
And after China, what? Professor Kawa-
kami is quoted: “Japan must have a place
in the sun.” And Marquis Okuma: “Japan
in a sense holds the destiny of Asia in
her hand.” It saw the effect of its defeat
of Russia upon every Asiatic country, India

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Wood.
It was night when I came to the wood,
The wood of the stricken trees,
When the dreariest wind of the world
From desolate, lonely seas
Was bemoaning the ancient wrong,
Conceived and begot of the slime,
Remembered by sea and wind
Since the grey beginning of lame.
There was fear in the ways of the wood
Where the trees were as white as bone,
With never a leaf to shake
In the wind that made such moan.
Ah. God! For the leaves and birds.
For sap and for song long flown.
For the time when the trees were alive
In the wood that is still now as stone!
And the life that was rife in the wood
When it sparkled in sun and rain,
Did it go from the wood like a ghost >
When the trees by the men were slain t
Did it go, or still does it stay?
What is it that moves in the shade
In a darkness darker than night -
And why is my heart afraid?
All around me the night seems full
Of beautiful, sorrowful eyes.
Like the eves that shadow and grieve
When a loved one whitens and dies.
But their grief was not lest I die
(And faster and faster I fled),
They sorrowed for me that I Uvea;
For this was the Wood of the Dead.
N.S.W.
P. E. Quinn.
The Envious Gods.
In the long darkness, when from garden
groves
Comes the faint, fruity smell of mango
flowers,
And, blundering by your window, flits a moth
Missing the light, but far too frail to rise
Above the roof of boughs to find a star,
Then to the open lattice feel your way
And, leaning from the window, wait, nor
speak
One word of welcome when you hear my feet
Slip stealthily among the arid grass,
For spirit things are easily scared away.
You must not trim a lamp to lure me in,
You must not set your table for a feast,
But on the lattice you may place a bloom- -
Some sweet, pale jasmine, scented with old
dreams;
Nothing so red as roses that we plucked
When I was not afraid of leaping blood;
But now I fear the gods too much to darp
To come to you with roses and with wine.
The gods are envious of earthly loves,
But the white fire of spirit shall evade
Their quenching fingers as they dice and
brawl.
Why should they peer in any garden’s gloom V
Why should they stoop to any mango grove?
If I forego your kisses, they will sleep
Deeming us lost for ever in regret.
And when you see two fragile hands that
move
About the jasmine that you place for me,
Oh! do not touch them with your hungry
lips,
For should that flower warm into a rose
The gods might see it glowing in the dark !

Light of the World.
Man, who had slept, awoke. With his first
sight
He cried with his uplifted voice for light—
Light where before the dark was manifest
In the primeval chaos of his breast.
And swift in answer from far pole to pole
He heard the curtains of the great gods roll
Backwards with thunder, while a stinging
pain
Fell on his eyes that opened once again,
Beholding in effulgence a new Earth
Where henceforth days and nights would
have their birth
In bright succession—Night its crescent
hour,
And Day supreme with incandescent power,
Which by their sacraments still consecrate
The morning and the evening of man’s state!
N.s.w.
LOLA GORNALL.
Old Love.
There lies a garden in a summer land
Where lilies sleep on the pale stream at noon;
And, nearer to the sea, the waters croon
In myriad crystal curtains, rainbow-spanned,
Where by the drowsy waves the olives stand,
And silver ripples break on silver sand.
Now in the twilight shades the roses twine
Unheeded in that' garden of old grief;
The path is soft with many an autumn’s leaf
Where once our happy feet were wont to
climb;
And where we wandered once in summer-time
The ways are woven with slow-clambering
vine.
Into the garden, rambling and unkempt,
1 came, a stranger, after many years :
The laurel aisles were dim with unshed tears
And over all the deep, cool grass had crept;
The summer sun was bright, but the wind
wept,
And on the pool the golden lilies slept.
Still is that perfumed silence strangely fair,
The roses in the heavy shades are red,
But over all the sadness of the dead
Broods heavily. The flowers seem to stare;
The winds that loitered in her golden hair
Weep—for a summer’s love lies buried there.
VICTORIA.

THE TOOL-ROOM & ITS EQUIPMENT
All who are familiar with the methods of production demanded by modern
conditions know that the tool-room is an important unit in any manufacturing
scheme, and that on its efficiency the profitable running of a plant is, to a large
extent, dependent.
A manufacturing plant consists mainly of capstan and turret lathes, auto-
matic machines for bar and chuck work, milling machines, drilling machines and
grinding machines.
These tools cannot be run efficiently unless facilities are provided for
supplying the special tools, jigs and fixtures which they use. It is therefore
essential that a tool-room should be installed, having the plant necessary for the
actual production of these articles, in addition to the accommodation and
machinery which is required for their storage and maintenance.
Having had over 20 years’ experience with one of the largest manufacturers
of these tools, jigs and fixtures which are required in all manufacturing plants
we are in a position to give reliable advice on the equipment and operation of
tool-rooms, either large or small.
We supply the tool-room plant itself, lathes, milling machines, shapers
drilling machines and grinders, and also the drills, taps, reamers, gauges and fine
tools which are used either in the tool-room or in the main machine-shop.

PEACE ON EARTH, GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN.
(A Christmas Carol by the Nations.)
The orchestra of Christmas-tide appears
But once in each recurring year of life.
It plays a tune, at best, of doubts and fears
Concerning bills, and the eternal strife
Of creditors and their dejected prey.
All the performers virtuously talk
Of Charity — they're doing it to-day
Wherever Wealth and Pauperism walk.
N.s.w.
As in the past we sing of Love and Peace
While Jap and Chow hiss words of litter hate;
While Turks slit Christian throats in ancient Greece;
And Ireland strafes the stranger in its gate.

This should have been the gayest Christmas Day
The harassed human race has ever seen :
In point of fact, it is in every way
The same old Festival it’s always been.

FEDERAL RAILWAYS, AND THE
BIG HOLE IN THE COMMON-
WEALTH.
An interesting and instructive but not
cheerful document is the latest report on
Federal railways. It is one more warning
to an over-sanguine, over-borrowed, over-
railwayed people, with too many holidays
and imports and politicians, that they are
eating up the credit and resources of the
country very fast. And it teaches that there
is no dead-sure salvation in laying two or
four streaks of borrowed metal by labor
bought with borrowed money, and then run-
ning a borrowed train on them to carry next
to nothing. Australia, it is necessary to
remember, is a unique place. It is the most
low-lying of all the continents, being, on the
estimate of a recent map-maker, about one-
third the average height above sea-level
that North America is. Some three-fourths
of it slopes inwards. In this area the
rivers when there are any and when they
flow at all, flow inward. The bottom, ter-
minus and destination of all this—the In-
land Sea of a continent, and the gathering
place of half a thousand nominal rivers and
half a million nominal streams —is Lake
Eyre in South Australia, a salt, shallow
pan or pothole 39 feet below sea-level!
To this finish come the waters from near
the Gulf of Carpentaria on the north ; from
Kalgoorlie (if it had any waters apart from
those brought to it 400 miles per pipe) on
the west; from a little north of. Port
Augusta on the south; and on the east from
the back yards of Broken Hill and Milpa-
rinka, from Longreach, Barcaldine and even
places near to Charters Towers. The edge
of the Big Hole runs for a long way parallel
with the Gulf of Carpentaria on one side,
the distance between the rim of the basin
and the northern sea being about lfjO miles.
For hundreds of miles on the other side it'
runs parallel with the Great Australian
Bight at a distance from the southern sea
of live or 10 or 20 miles. The depression
consists of two parts. The smaller (eastern)
one is where the big rivers like the Cooper
(570 miles), Thompson (240 miles) and
Diamantina (468 miles) flow towards Lake
Eyre, but mostly sink into the earth or rise
into the air and blow away as dust before
they get there. It is mainly this area that
is to be traversed by the north-and-south
transcontinental railway (Port Augusta to
Darwin). It is the Land of Such Hope As
There Is. The larger (western) section,
traversed by the east-west line to Perth, is
riverless and is the Land of No Visible
Hope. Its streams would doubtless rendez-
vous at Lake Eyre if there were any, but
there isn’t even a Barcoo. This sort of geo-
graphy makes timid or sluggish people almost
doubtful about the wisdom of any unlimited
pawning of Posterity’s soul with a view to
railway adventures far out. Some even
think these adventures should be paid for
with cash, refusing to regard the saline pot-
hole which is the culmination of 75 per
cent, of the continent as a reason why our
children's children should pay for our drinks
and fine raiment. It looks too much like
borrowing a million on the security of the
disease that grandfather died of and leaving
the grandchildren to pay it. The Federal
railway report supplies evidence in favor of
this view.
* * # *
Australia also has its Murray River Basin ;
in fact, Australia has only two definite river
basins—the Murray and Lake Eyre. The
Murray system is a moderately moist infant,
while Lake Eyre is a dry giant. The Mur-
ray Basin includes the fertile vales of Broken
Hill, which is on the border of the two
catchments; also it includes many better
places. The Big Trickle is a very great
Trickle indeed—great in length if not in
diameter, and it is hoped by extensive and
expensive Avorks to make it permanently
naA'igable over an appreciable distance for
liners drawing as much as 5ft. Yet its
finish, if it had much further to go before
reaching the sea, would be much the same as
that of the foaming Cooper or the sparkling
Thompson, and for the same reason. For
the last 450 miles it ambles through dry
country, and the supply of affluents gives
out. Soakage, drinkage and evaporation
tend to eat the Trickle up. Even tributaries
like the _ Gumbo and the Black Gin cease.
In addition to these two definite systems or
basins, Australia has a number of isolated
rivers—good and fresh, though scattered
and of no great length—mostly in Queens-
land and the Northern Territory, but they
don’t affect the Federal raihvay balance-
sheet. _ The Federal railways and the Big
Hole in the CommonAvealth are inseparably
connected.
* • • •
Of the two big Federal lines, the east-west
transcontinental (finished) and the north-
south transcontinental (half-finished), the
latter is the more hopeful. As already men-
tioned, the Big Hole which occupies about
three-fourths of the Commonwealth and lias
its apex (downward) in the Dead Sea of
Eyre, is in two sections. The eastern one,
Avhich includes the McDonnell Ranges and
the roadbed of the Port Augusta-Darwin line,
having rivers of a dusty sort, has also a rain-
fall of sorts and in parts. If it were other-
wise such streams as the Georgina and the
Mulligan would be impossible. And it is
the best —or least-badly—rained-upon part of
this eastern section through which the north-
south line is yet to be built. The part through
the regions of least rain is about finished.
The western section—the one traversed
by the east-to-west line (Port Augusta-Kal-
goorlie-Perth)—has no rivers. The north-
ern line is expected to grow better when,
instead of being in two isolated fragments
ending nowhere, it becomes a complete work
leading to Darwin; the oversea airship ter-
minus of Australia. The western line is
expected to grow worse as the mines of Kal-
goorlie wear out. Meanwhile things are
steadily on the downgrade with the Federal
railways in the Big Hole and elsewhere.
This is the recent record:—

In addition to these, and quite apart from
the Big Hole in the Commonwealth, the
Federal Government owns five miles of rail-
way between Queanbeyan and the Federal
capital at Canberra. It isn’t a pioneer line
in empty country, but is located in an old,
settled district, and as a city is being built
at great public expense for its terminus
much traffic is created in addition to tin
natural and ordinary trade. The line had
the great advantage that, till lately, no in-
terest was charged on cost gnd even now
interest is charged on only a fraction of cost.
There is nothing wrong with the place except
that it is located‘in the driest part of the
fairly-watered coastal district, and the Curse
of Canberra is upon it. The record of this
pampered and favored five-mile scrap of line

The case is here cut short because the
Court is tired and wants to adjourn for
Christmas refreshments, so the jury brings
in its verdict as follows:
(1) That by reason of the unfortunate Dry Hole
in the Commonwealth ‘called the Lake Eyre River
Basin, with the riverless district attached, a very
large area of Australia is a region in which rail-
ways can never be expected, with any possible scale
of fares and freights, to show a profit over and above
working expenses. And as air navigation develops
their position is likely to get no better. Therefore
borrowing money to build railways in the Hole is
as bad as borrowing it to spend in drink—or more
so, for drink that is drunk isn’t liable to show a loss
on working 'expenses ever afterwards, and the price
of drink doesn't go up after it is drunk, whereas
the price of old loans is liable to go up with each
renewal.
(2) That a good part of the land in the Murray
River Basin is not a great deal better than much of
the land in the Hole, and the same logic applies.
(3) That the only honest thing to do is to pay
off out of revenue the debts already incurred for
railways in the Hole (and a great many other rail-
ways as well), the annual increase in the interest
bill being terrible.
(4) That if there isn't a material improvement
this country, when it strikes a bad year in the loan
market, will be driven to shut up many of the lines
to save loss on working expenses. (When the N. S.
Wales State Government talks seriously about paying
increased wages out of loans the stoppage is very
near.)
(5) That the Commonwealth is a very unlucky
railway owner. It possesses 1735 miles of track.
Not one of its four systems pays working expenses,
let alone interest. Barring the Port Darwin-Katherine
River line in the Northern Territory all its lines are
growing worse. And though two of its lines are dis-
tinctly in the Hole where good results are hard to
achieve, by far the biggest loss per mile is made
on the line which is furthest from the Hole and
which has nothing save the Curse of Canberra to
plead in explanation.
And the jury respectfully asks: (1) What
the Federal Government thinks of itself,
and (2) what the Federal Government pro-
poses to do about it?
AUSTRALIA’S GREAT GAMBLING
MONOPOLY.
At intervals, all over Australia, threatening
movements are made in the direction of the
racecourses. Someone discovers that in a
given State there are 50, or 100, or 150 more
meetings per annum than there were when
the previous agitation took place; and the
whole institution is menaced with a good,
hard knock if it doesn’t behave itself better.
In accordance with the immutable laws of
periodicity, it was N. S. Wales’s turn the
other day. The A.J.G. suddenly realised
that there were about 100 meetings too
many in and around Sydney; wherefore it
proposed to absorb Moorefield and Warwick
Farm on generous terms. The Clubs con-
cerned objected vehemently, as was natural;
and, in the words of Holman’s Chief Sec-
retary, “the measure necessary to give effect
to the proposal was abandoned for the
present Parliament.” This has been more
or less the usual procedure all over Aus-
tralia ever since the first thoroughbred
arrived in the country.

What is basically wrong with the racing
industry? The trouble is that, like the hotel
business, it has been diverted from its
original intention. The public-house used
to be a tavern before it degenerated into a
boozing-den. The racecourse used to be
primarily an arena for testing the speed and
staying-power of horses: it has become a
gigantic betting-shop, with ramifications ex-
tending to every city and most towns of the
Commonwealth. Gambling is regarded by
the Churches as a sin; by the Bench as one
of the chief incentives to crime; and by ex-
perts in statecraft as contrary to the com-
mon weal. Every week or so, therefore,
large bodies of men (mostly white) are
arrested and fined for playing two-up, and
other large bodies (mostly yellow) are
seized and dealt with for gambling at fan-
tan. Yet, by universal consent, these are
the two fairest games of chance in the world.
They give the punter an even more equit-
able run than Rouge et Noir as played at
Monte Carlo. Public gambling is only legal
on racecourses in Australia. It is respect-
abilised there, so far as the patronage of
vice-regality and of the leading members of
the community can do it; and the Churches
are mute, even if they disapprove. This,
although the whole business is so honey-
combed with dishonesty, not to say black-
guardism, that a sport which might be as
reputable as yacht-racing has become a
synonym for swindling. The citizen who
wishes to bet without breaking the law is
barred from wagering on a beach or ferry-
boat, in a hotel, or even in his own home.
He has to swell the dividends of some such
privately-owned enterprise as Moorefield in
the form of an admission-fee to the course;
and he then has to put his money on an
animal which mav be “stiff” because the
jockey has been squared or has backed
another horse; or which may have been
“deadened” otherwise by the trainer, the
owner, or even some interested stranger; or
which may become the object of the hostile
attentions of rival jockeys during the race.
The odds on offer in the Ring are con-
ditioned partly by the fact that a bookmaker
who knows his business adjusts his wagers
in such a way as to show a profit on each
race no matter what wins; and partly by
the “jokes” that are in progress. It is
understandable, in the circumstances, that
every honest punter, who bets high, winds up
ultimately the loser of a fortune. The big
money in this legalised system of robbery
is made by the Ring, by town and country
betting-shop proprietors under the tacit pro-
tection of the police, and by
horse-owners and their employees. For their
benefit, and for the benefit of those in-
terested in the clubs, the Law struggles tire-
lessly to dam the entire volume of public
gambling inside the confines of a racecourse.
The whole community may bet till it is
ruined for six days a week, if it likes—pro-
vided the monopoly of the classes above
mentioned is upheld.
* * * •
If such an arrangement were proposed in
a country which had never known racing,
its author would be looked on as a lunatic!
His only excuse here is that it 1 is grown
up wdth Time. It will continue to grow
till one of the State Governments has the
nerve or honesty, or whatever it may be
called, to defy the vested interests concerned
and put what should be a national business
as well as a national sport on a nationalised
footing. The first step towards freeing the
racecourse of its excrescences consists in the
total abolition of the bookmaker. It will be
useless to warn him off the courses if he is
allowed to carry on in “shops.” So his ex-
termination must be a matter of honest
police administration in the last resort. In
most of the Australian States at present, if
the “shop”-proprietors didn’t own the police,
they would periodically share the fate of the
two-up practitioners. With the book-
maker gone, not merely in theory but in
fact, the herd of tick-tackers, touts, lum-
berers, buttoners, deadeners and so forth—
the vermin who have ruined the health of
racing for decades past—would expire. It
has been said in defence of the bookmaker
that the breeding of thoroughbred stock is
a business proposition, and that people won’t
breed racehorses unless they can bet about
them with the Ring as opposed to the tote,
or sell them to those who may do so. Modern
France supplies an answer to that fallacy.
Under the French system .the Government
runs racing and makes it pay; the breeding
industry is a big factor in the national
wealth ; and racegoers have nothing to com-
plain about. In the 12 months which pre-
ceded the war, the French Government dis-
tributed £650,000 ill prize-money, attracting
owners from every racing country in Europe.
There are just on 3000 sires at present in
the National haras, and the number is to be
raised to 4000 as soon as possible. These
animals are of every class; they are the
best procurable in their class; and it pays
the Government to allow' approved mares
to visit some of them for as low a fee as
15 francs. In addition to the peerless courses
around Paris, practically every French pro-
vince had its regular race-meetings before
the wmr. They were controlled by the Min-
ister for Agriculture; the Government pro-
vided all the prize-money (for steeplechases
and trotting-races as well as flat-races) ; and
they were as free from sharp practices as
our. own A., H. and P. shows. The profits
froni these meetings, which have re-starttjd
except in the devastated North, are mostly
allocated to local improvements and develop-
ments in the way of roads, bridges and the
like. The English system is the nearest
approach to ours. Its features are the pri-
vately-owned racecourse, bookmaking and
private-enterprise breeding. Lord D’Aber-
non, a prominent member of the English
Turf Club, said recently:—
One is often ashamed to bring Colonial and foreign
breeders to our racecourses.... On some courses one
is positively ashamed to see what poor accommoda-
tion is given to the less-wealthy portion of the
public.
The prizes for English classics such as the
One- and Two-Thousand Guineas and even
the Derby are contemptible when compared
with the £12,000 added money for the Grand
Prix de Paris, not to mention the £4OOO for
the Grand Prix de Deauville, which is a
mere seaside town —a sort of French Manly
Beach. England and Ireland produce the
best horses in the -world for all purposes,
just as Australia produces the best sheep.
Yet as each war recurs the British Army
authorities have to scour the earth for re-
mounts. France, Germany, Austria, Hun-
gary and Russia (till the revolution) never
had to go. beyond their frontiers for horse-
flesh ; for in each of these countries the pro-
duction of horses was the affair of. the
State. State-owned courses and State-breed-
ing establishments, with all their implica-
tions in the way of protection for the tax-
payers from exploitation by sporting sharps
—these are the changes needed in Austra-
lian racing. For politicians to talk sooth-
ingly of putting the present system on a
“better basis” is like aspiring to put em-
bezzlement on a better basis. The thing is
a contradiction in terms.
LABOR AND THE ISLANDER.
“Compulsory labor,” even when the labor
is well paid, has a nasty sound; but how
we are going to do our duty in our old pos-
sessions in the Pacific, and in the new ter-
ritories over which we have got control, with-
out some form of it, I do not know; and
I have been studying the question almost
ever since the Berrima landed the first Ex-
peditionary Force in German New Guinea.
What, first, is our duty to these natives?
The chief end of the “boy” who has not
been brought into touch with civilisation
is the slaying of his neighbor, the chewing
of betel-nut, and the evasion of work. The
womenfolk of the villages have to perform
all necessary labor.
Contrast him with the boy who has served
his three or six years on a plantation, or
as a police or work-boy with the Govern-
ment. He returns to his place and imme-
diately cultivates his patch of taro or yam.
He is invaluable in the tribal council and
an advocate always for peace. To the
patrol-officer he is a godsend, and as anyone
who has seen him in his home can testify,
he is immeasurably cleaner in his habits
and surroundings.
Authority admits that work is a good
thing for the native. After seeing the con-
trast between the boy who has been on
a job and one who hasn’t it could not avoid
that conclusion. So, primarily in order to
teach him the value of work in Papua, it in-
stituted the head-tax of 10s. per annum,
payable in money, its value in kind, or by
labor on Government plantations or stations.
In effect, the New Guinea native whom it
is most desirable to reach, having no money
and very little produce “takes it out” in
labor. But the system of taking work from
a village in lieu of head-tax effects not one of
the desirable transformations. Two months’


absence on work they do not understand,
with no remuneration in either trade or
money, leaves the natives merely with v a
grudge against Government; and it is not
to be wondered at.
So we do this: we introduce a system
of compulsory labor and, while incurring
whatever stigma there may be attaching to
it, we derive practically no advantage trom
it. Certainly we do not improve our relations
with the natives, and in my experience we
do not improve the natives. Instead of show-
ing them the advantages of labor, we make
them indisposed to do it, because they do not.
plainly see its rewards.
That may be, probably is, one of the
causes producing the unshakeable refusal of
a erowing majority of the natives to “make
paper”—that is, to sign on for a couple, of
years’ labor service. This is most notice-
able in New Guinea, and is much more
marked in those districts within the in-
fluence of missionaries. To those who are
dependent upon recruited labor to maintain
plantations upon which large sums have
been spent, it is an alarming fact that
nothing short of “pulling” will yield one
recruit in many districts capable of giving
five or six thousand. The more difficult it
becomes to obtain labor legitimately, the
greater the danger of improper practices.
Any system of compulsory labor would, of
course, have to be most carefully controlled.
Its disadvantages—though with proper safe-
guards they would be more sentimental than
real —are obvious enough. Its advantages
are equally certain and far more substantial.
In the first place, private recruiting would
of necessity be abolished; and that alone
would be a great advance. We could also
abolish the present head-tax, with all its
serious disadvantages—especially the dis-
advantage of making men labor without re-
ward, thus doing them the worst disservice
in our power—that is, prejudicing them
against industry. v
Our present ordinances relative to employ-
ment have as their objective the regula-
tion of Private Enterprise in its exploita-
tion of the native as a laborer; and it is
quite unnecessary to affirm that Private
Enterprise has not at heart the native’s
benefit or emancipation. Any advantage the
native may get from the present system is
therefore in spite of it, and not by reason
of it. The primary objective ought to be
the benefit of the native. At present, if he
benefits at all, it is quite incidental. Ther?
is surely need of a system that will alter
that.
MOHOBE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Profiteer’s Christmas-box.
It was well nigh a certainty that the Refer-
endum questions would be negatived. Ex-
treme Conservatives and extreme Laborites
opposed them, and even the Hughesites de-
clined to do them much reverence. The
first effect of their defeat is to free the
Hughes Government from the awkward
obligation of administering an Anti-
Profiteering Act. This should be advan-
tageous in ways. It will prevent dissension
between Nationalist Progressives and Tories
in Parliament; and the profiteers outside,
finding that their activities are not being
interfered with, will go on supporting the
party and subscribing to its funds. Yet it
would have benefited the Nationalists in the
long run if they had been given a chance to
translate their leader’s anti-profiteering
threats into action. The public is sick of
being over-charged, and the first party whmh
provides it with a scapegoat will earn tre-
mendous kudos. It is impossible to penalise
the man who invented paper money; many,
of those who killed Australia’s 60.00"
soldier-producers are themselves dead and
the rest are overseas; strikers, who are
another cause of the increased cost of living,
can’t be got at —there are too many of them.
But the profiteer, and especially the retail
profiteer, the person who cold-bloodedly over-
charges in respect of a definite across-the-
counter transaction, is a tangible irritant.
He may play only a small role in the vast
economic drama which has brought the value
of the £1 sterling tumbling down; but he is
certainly one of the villains —in the eyes of
the public perhaps the most detestable in
the cast. The Parliament of the United
Kingdom, where Unification has been in
force for centuries, was able to pass
a valid Anti-Profiteering Act. Under it
each district elects a committee. The
committee appoints an inspector. T l ' •'
inspector prices goods, and where the charges
are extortionate the committee prosecutes.
Prices are necessarily high in Britain —an
importing nation faced with the ruin of
many of those countries on which it formerly
depended for supplies—but they came down
with a rush, in most lines, when the com-
mittees began their operations. And so they
would here if similar legislation were valid
under our Constitution. T. J. Ryan,
with whom electioneering is an art, no doubt
foresaw a Labor defeat. It was long-visioned
strategy, in the circumstances, to order his
followers to vote “No.” It means that the
largest exploiters will be able legally to
charge what they like for years to come. But
while the exploiter grows fat, and the workers
go short, the latter will have the consolation
of knowing that the Hughes Government,
by its inaction, is providing the Ryan party
with a sort of reason why it should be over-
thrown. There is, of course, the chance
that the States may legislate against pro-
fiteering. It is now the one hope the pro-
fiteer’s victims have. Most of the Assemblies
are, no doubt, willing to pass Anti-Profiteer-
ing Bills. All the Legislative Councils, on
the other hand, may be relied on to cast
them out if they threaten to be really effect-
ive. Taking things by and large the
profiteer has reason to be pleased with his
Christmas offering—the joint tribute of the
Farmers’ party and the I.W.W.
Profiteers, Old and New.
There is no end to the strange stories of
the profiteers who make big money out of
Australia while this country is growing or
trying to grow wheat, organising strikes,
listening to the tales of people like Ryan
who denounce almost every little industry
that we possess, pondering One Big Union
schemes for confiscating workshops and
banks, and floating ruinous loans. Tne lead-
ing Maoriland journals have just put up
prices to 2d. because of the awful increase
in the cost of printing paper; some of the
Australian dailies had already led the way
in that direction, and others are about to
follow. The good old Nippon Yusen Ivnishu
(Japanese Mail Steamship Co.), which
trades here, has declared a dividend ana
bonus of 100 per cent. (£2,000,000) out of
the year’s profits. It is mentioned in this
connection that 264,000 tons of shipping
(counting only good ships to be classified
Al at Lloyd’s) are constructing in Japan.
The Australian companies which roused
Ryan to such fury that he called on the
people to elect him so that he might “deal
out stoush” to them make from 54 to 15
per cent., the difference between these
figures and 100 per cent, being the differ-
ence between the profits we make for our-
selves and those that other people make out
of us so that they may pay taxes for Nippon
to buy armaments with. The Coats cotton
monopoly, Which produced £4,000,000 last
year after paying War Profits Tax, and
explained that over £3,600,000 was made out
of extraneous dupes or loafers like the Aus-
tralians, is accused of penalising with an
elaborate system of discounts any retailers
who cut prices even at their own loss.
Coats doesfl’t want prices disturbed, and
unless we start our own factories there is
no redress, for Coats stands for a combine
which supplies the world. Coats prac-
tically escapes taxes here, for its only visible
sign is a small office; and it even imports
its invoices. The story of the profits of the
Vacuum Oil Co. is quite fresh. Within the
last few weeks Dutch, Chinese, Italian,
Swedish and Finnish companies, incited by
the wealth which the Nippon Yusen Kaisha
and the P. and O. concern (£lOO shares in
the P. and O. are selling at £6OO or there-
abouts) make out of simple wheat-growers
and borrowers like the Australians, have
decided to butt into the Australian trade.
The Lancashire cotton-mill combine, to pro-
fiteer our shirts and handkerchiefs a little
more because we don’t grow or spin cotton,
is steadily developing. And by way of a
most awful case of profiteering, Queensland
has been charged between £6 6s. and £6 11s.
per cent, (according to date of repayment)
for a £2,000,000 loan which it had to raise
because the accumulated deficit of the raw-
material province is now approaching or
has arrived at that figure. It isn’t a ques-
tion of remunerative public works, though
no works could possibly pay that figure, but
of keeping the wolf of current expenses from
the door. All these ruinous profiteerings the
Labor loan crowd dare not even mention,
for the only remedy for them is more
work (though not for less wages), longer
hours (all paid for), and the making of
things for ourselves. So the men whose limited
intelligences don’t extend beyond strikes,
“dargs” and “go-slows” would have to swal-
low their own gospel whole if they seriously
alluded to this subject. And the Nationalist
loan crowd also sticks to its old text. Thus,
it was mentioned proudly the other day to
a Parliamentary committee that the Mitta
dam, a prospective monument of loan enter-
prise, will irrigate from 150,000 to 250,000
acres of land one of these days. The great
dam, built with money raised at any price,
is to take seven years to construct, and
if it runs to £7,000,000 no one need
be surprised considering the cost of labor and
material, though Yanco is only between
£4,000,000 and £5,000.000 in debt so far, and
lost only £209,000-odd last year. (The
Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme is supposed
to moisten 200,000 acres in time —a very
long time.) The Mitta work will produce a
lot of things of which Australia has a super-
abundance already, and some that it requires,
but it won’t do a penn’orth of work to shift
the monopoly of the thread people whom we
help to earn 40 per cent, dividends; or the
foreign shipping people whom we assist to
earn 100 per cent.; or the new Lancashire
cotton combine; or the paper people: or the
woollen people who charge 30s. per yard for
what cost 7s. 6d. before they learned the
great arts of combination and war-profiteer-
ing ; nor the financial monopolists who lend
money at £6 11s. per cent, so that we may
pay for the imported thing that costs four
times as much as it ought to do, and who
also, because we can’t nay when, the bill
falls due, are gaily doubling the price of the
money we borrowed and spent last century.
Nor will it shift, by the thousandth part of
an inch, any one of 1000 other profiteers.
Rather it will strengthen them by absorbing
the money and labor that are so badly wanted
for factories and shipbuilding. If 150,000
acres are irrigated within any reasonable
time at a cost of £6.000,000 or £7.000,000 of
ruinously dear money, and if, instead of
making a loss, it is possible to make £l2
per acre per year clear profit—profit after
paying interest, water-rates, etc. —the whole
result won’t pay our annual bill to the foreign
woollen profiteer alone. It will hardly half
pay the foreign cotton or linen profiteer, and
barely pay the foreign paper profiteer.. And
by the time the water begins to flow in the
irrigation channels these people may have
doubled their charges. The Labor party’s
answer to this profiteering was to organise
strikes in N. S. Wales last half-year on such
an unusual scale that it was about equal to
12,000 men being on strike all the time, and
the great bulk of these stoppages were de-
vised to help foreign profiteers by hanging
up industries which competed, however
humbly, against their monopolies. And the
answer of both parties all the time is to
give the foreign profiteer a further mortgage
over us.
Loan Works in Dog’s Country and
Elsewhere.
The raising of the minimum wage in N*. S.
Wales to £3 17s. a week opens a new vista
for the railways—a vista with hobgoblins
on each side and a pit at the end. The
situation as it now presents itself is about
as follows: —
The railway deficit in N. S. Wales last year was
£211,817, despite two heavy increases of rates in
close succession. The shortage will now rise to
£2,211,817 or thereabouts unless more revenue is
raised. This means charging Is. instead of Od.
Twelve years ago it cost 3s. 10jd. to drive the
average train a mile. Last year it cost 6s. lid. It
is expected to cost Bs. 6sd. next year. The year
after is on the knees of the gods—or the devils.
There are thus, so far as it is possible to see,
only six serious troubles ahead of the N. S. Wales
railways in addition to this trouble. They are:
(1) The next increase of wages, which is due
when the foreign combines take it into their heads
to boost up prices and shipping freights again ; for
increased coßts in Australia are partly a matter of
the increased demands of foreign profiteers and
partly the result of our own “slowing-down on the
job.”
(2) The constant increase of interest on old
loans, which is much the 1 same as if the butcher
now put up the price of the meat we ate in 1886.
When the borrowing that the man of 60 did with
pride at a mere 31 per cent, when he was 26 falls
due, and the loan has to be renewed at about 6
per cent., lines that were payable become unpay-
able, and rates have to go up.
(3) The fact that a crazy Government continues
to build railways lavishly with money borrowed at
6 per cent., though there is hardly a line on earth,
even in old densely-peopled countries, which seems
able to stand a burden like that.
(4) The fact that N. S. Wales gets not much
more than half as much railway for the money that
costs, say, 6 per cent, as it did for the money that
cost 31 per cent. Wages have gone up, and the
labor output per man has gone down, and the
foreign combines and profiteers have put up the
price of materials enormously.
(5) The fact that when the money is borrowed at
increased cost, and the railway is built at further
increased cost and the train is purchased at very
much increased cost to put on the railway, it is
going to cost nearly 2$ times the rate of 12 years
ago to run the train.
(6) The fact that, as railway building goes on
much faster than the increase of population, the
stock of good places to build even cheap railways
to is rather short at present. About 30 years ago
N. S. Wales was borrowing at from 3 to 4 per
cent, to build lines with cheap labor and cheap
material in God’s country between Sydney and
Hornsby or between Armidale and Tenterfield. Now
it borrows at rates which totter between 64 and
6 per cent, to build with dear labor and dear
materials in or on the border of Dog’s country, out
west where the dingo is taking possession.
In the circumstances Premier Holman
might reconsider his scheme for borrowing
£13,110,400 for public works in one fatal
act. Surely there are some things the Ma
State could do to supply the urgent local
wants (clothes, machinery, electrical ap-
paratus, matches, building materials to re-
lieve the house famine, etc. ) which are ex-
pressed in its £30,000,000 of imports!
Surely it knows or can learn something be-
sides how to drive empty trains that earn
next to nothing over the Plain of Dry Bones
on the edge of Dog’s Country.
«
The Control of Aircraft.
When the Federal Constitution was con-
structed people like H. G. Wells, who fore-
saw the flying era, were regarded as fan-
tastics. So, while the National Parliament
was given powers of quarantine, it was given
none over flying—a mode of transport by
which quarantine laws may be set at naught.
At a time when flying has arrived both for
commercial purposes and as a chief feature
of invasive warfare, the Commonwealth
can’t pass any valid air legislation, and the
States can’t pass uniform air legislation. It
has been truthfully said of Australia that it
is the only white man’s country where it is
possible to break a neck without breaking
an Act. Any feather-brained idiot may go
up in an unsafe machine and crash in the
main street of a city. There has been
vague talk of local action in some of the
States —notably in Victoria and N. S. Wales.
But the States themselves seem to feel the
absurdity of such a move. Britain achieved
an Aerial Navigation Act as soon as flying
became a matter of practical transport. Yet
it was soon realised that even a national Act
was too parochial for permanent use in
Europe. Its value could only be in the
long run that of something supplementary
to an international measure. Hence a
committee has been sitting for some months
past in Paris, evolving a World Act for the
control of flying, the idea of which is,
broadly, that the representatives of the
nations shall be empowered to put a sort of
aerial Plimsoll mark on all aeroplanes. A
matter which was too vast for Britain is
obviously too extensive for an Australian
State. Further, the effect of individual
State action, even if it were taken, would
be to hamper the new industry, or military
arm. A machine might leave Sydney in
perfect order according to the aerial laws of
N. S. Wales; yet its pilot might be breaking
the laws of Victoria from the moment he
crossed the border, inasmuch as certain con-
ditions required in that State were unful-
filled. And a ’plane which was eligible in
both States might require alterations before
it could cross imaginary lines representing
the beginning of S. Aus. or Queensland. Once
the principle of State air control is estab-
lished it will be hard to shift. The depart-
mentalists who fasten on it will be bound
to raise the State Rights cry in self-defence
the moment a Federal Act threatens their
livelihood. Between now and the inevitable
Constitutional alteration empowering the
National Parliament to legislate for flying
throughout the Commonwealth, it is probably
best, by and large, that the Australian Aero
Club should do the necessary work m the
direction of air safety. The club s p v
derive from its affiliation with the ot -
cial British and French bodies. it
can prevent “stunting” over towns ana
crowded places, in the case of most
pilots, by a threat of disqualification
—a punishment which “carries all over
the worjjl. Also its officials can test
passenger-carrying machines for. safety ana
certify them, as well as their pilots, wheie
they are worthy. No pilot and no machine
could be made to submit to such tests, but
the public might draw inferences about those
who didn’t. Aero-club control has obvious
disadvantages: it is only a makeshift at
best. But it is better, anyhow, than no
control, as at present. Above all, it can .be
imposed at once, which is the main require-
ment.

A Maoriland Windfall.
A Maoriland correspondent tells of a
remarkable piece of good fortune that lately
came the way of Massey’s Dominion:
Under the will of the late Thomas Cawthron, of
Nelson (M.L.), the residue of the estate, a sum of
£240,000 after the payment of certain legacies, was
left for the erection and maintenance of a technical
school, institute and museum, to be called the Caw-
thron Institute. The trustees named in the will are,
with one exception, holders of public offices in or
near Nelson; viz., the M.P. for Nelson, the chairman
of the Harbor'Board, the Mayor of Nelson and the
chairman of the Waimoa County Council. Incident-
ally, during his lifetime, Mr. OAWTiinoN was a great
benefactor to the city of Nelson, assisting in the
erection of the Nelson Institute and Museum and the
School of Music, and in securing the Cawthron Park
of 7000 acres of native bush and mountain.
Before proceeding to adopt a scheme the trustees
set up a private commission consisting of the presi-
dent of the M.L. Board of Agriculture; Dr. Bknham,
F.R.S., professor of zoology (Dunedin) ; Dr. Cockayne,
F.R.S., Government botanist; Dr. Easterfield, pro-
fessor of chemistry (Wellington) ; Dr. Marshall,
professor of geology (Dunedin), and Dr. Wooley,
professor of chemistry (Auckland), to examine
evidence and report as to the best method of giving
effect to the will of the testator. The commission
recommended that the Institute should be erected in
or near the city of Nelson, and that its chief work
should be the performance of, and instruction in,
scientific research ; that this research should be of a
technical character, and have reference to M.L. indus-
tries ; and that a liberal scheme of scholarships and
fellowships should be provided to attract science
graduates to carry out research work under the
expert staff of the Institute. The principles of
the report have been accepted by the trustees ; but as
the legality of their action was disputed the matter
was tested in the Supreme Court. Except in certain
details the scheme received approval. Professor
Easterfield was thereupon appointed director of the
Institute, and Mr. T. Rioo, M.Sc., agricultural
chemist. Other appointments will probably be made
shortly.
The original value of the bequest was £240,000,
of which £40,000 has been paid in stamp duties.
There is a very strong feeling in Maoriland that in
consideration of the national character of the work
of the Institute the Government should contribute
to the revenue of the Institute an annual sum equal
to 5 per cent, on the stamp duties. In the circum-
stances it seems a very modest request to make.
A site for the Institute has been secured about two
miles out from the city. It is beautifully situated
upon a gentle slope overlooking Tasman Bay, ami
has an area of 20 acres. Until buildings are erected
the scientific work will be carried out in temporary
premises in Nelson.
Two further bequests have already been made to
the Institute —one under the will of Miss Marsden,
of Nelson ; the other by Mr. G. McMartree, who
bequeathed his library of chemical and mining litera-
ture. The work is obviously of national importance,
and is sure to receive further public recognition.
Twenty years ago S. Australia began the use
of superphosphates; and within five years
Jenkin Coles declared that it had added a
pound an acre to the use-value of the agri-
cultural lands of the State. About the same
time a Victorian brewery chemist began to
experiment with the use of acid and oil in
the separation of, zinc from the till then
valueless tailings dumps at Broken Hill.
The result is the flotation process which has
since added directly over 12 millions sterling
to the wealth of Australia and probably half
as much indirectly, besides providing the
basis for manufacturing industries which
one by one are coming into existence. For
many years Great Cobar sold its copper to
Germany for refining. A Sydney chemist,
digging into the product, discovered that the
red metal contained gold which had never
been paid for; and the work of the chemist
rescued Cobar and gave it its most fruitful
20 years’ life. Yet, notwithstanding that
such achievements of science in Australasia
might easily be extended to a column, there
is no country in the world where more
wealth is wasted; which means that there is
no country where such an agency as the
Cawthron Institute has a larger field for
national service, and therefore deserves a
heartier welcome from the public and sym-
pathetic treatment from the Government.

“Albatross” writes from Rabaul: —
Rabaul —Simpson Harbor —is nearly everything you
could desire from a seaman’s point of view; it has
good anchorage for craft of all sizes, and splendid
wharf-building facilities. There are also hot salt-
water creeks, which may (or may not) be beneficial
to rheumatic subjects; but this is only a side-
issue. Dawapir Rocks, in the fairway, afford
additional protection to a perfectly landlocked har-
bor. They are remarkable-looking, and a prom-
inent feature of Rabaul.
Militarism has run riot here. Three pip men,
at nearly a pound a pip per day, swank around, and
use the military caste for all it is worth. Some
of them never saw real fighting at all. Still, up
at the officers’ mess, it is “Boy!” here and “Boy!”
there. They may not love their cheap black labor
but they dissemble very well. The picnic is cost-
ing the Australian taxpayers a pretty penny, and
thoughtful people who have some patriotism left
are wondering when the show is going to be
placed under civil administration.
When it is we Australians will have a big prob-
lem to face. This port affords wonderful facilities
for a substantial naval base, to be used as a bul-
wark against Asiatic aggression. The “navies of
the world” could float here; and naval dockyards
and workshops are only just so much money and
labor. Whether our somnolent members of Par-

And the high corn-stems kiss.

And how should a word be stranger

Of a King of Babes in the manger?
Old star, you have said it long,
What is this, what is this?
The wind makes a low song
For something it seems to miss.
Wind, what is it that blows you wrong?
Wise Men, their wisdom scorning,
Have come far at the shine of the star
To beat at the gates of the morning.

The truth of the faith comes winging;
After red tears and the long, long fears
There is wider room for the singing.

liament make up their minds or not, the fact
remains that the menace of “the East” is right
here in this place. If we don’t know what can
be done with it our Asiatic friends do.
I have talked to a good many Japanese hel’e,
and each and every one of them expressed a liking
for England and a hatred for Australia. I am at
present on a slip run by an enterprising Japanese —-
ail ex-captain in the Japanese navy. His dislike Of
Australians is an obsession. His boss “No. 1” man,
who acts as slipmaster, is also diver, shipwright,
carpenter, draughtsman, fitter and general amanlien-
sis, His pay for all tins is 16s. per day. The
boss is not only a naval architect; he is also a
land and hydrographic surveyor. I have seen many
of his drawings, arid they are above criticism. I
have seen Japanese here doing work that the
strongest Etiropean would shrink from for a re-
muneration that certainly a white man would re-
ject with scorri. We have got to either work as
the Japanese work —not necessarily for the same
rate of pay—or go under!
Facts aie facts, and to watch the little brown
men working insidiously, studiously, towards tome
goal or another makes one who has just left Aus-
tralian ports tremble for the future.
On top of that there are plenty of Germans
here; naturally aggressive and abusive —especially
in liquor—and awaiting the time when we get
tired and go to sleep. Meantime they are nourishing
a hatred for Australia among the Japanese,
who cannot understand our immigration restric-
tion . laws. The question of color does not
enter the Japs’ minds. They argue: “We do all the
same British—build ship; make plenty manufac-
ture,” and they* think that ends the argument.
We heard a great deal about propaganda during
the war. One German military leader has de-
clared that it was propaganda which won the war
for the Allies. There is need of it now. Here and
elsewhere the Japanese undoubtedly have a cyrong
conception of the Australian policy; and it is
supremely foolish to allow them to abide with it,
if propaganda can give them enlightenment. If
we don’t want trouble we should get to work on
that. The Labor people ought to be particularly
interested in it.

N. S. Wales Prisons and the Man,
Samuel McCauley, who died last week,
was one of the most notable penologists that
N. S. Wales, with its long traditions of lag-
dom, lias ever had ; and the system which has
been his care is at least tlie equal, and per-
naps the superior, of anything of the kind in
British territories. From savage and re-
vengeful coercion, tlie administration of the
gaols of the Ma State has changed during
the last two decades into a reformative
agency, the spirit of which is the endeavor
to put a man on his feet again rather than
trample him into the slough of criminality
that was once the almost inevitable end of
the gaol-bird. Perhaps the best evidence of
the success of tlie life work of McCauley
lies in the number of prisons that lie was
able to close after he had assumed full
control. For his main object was to keep
men from returning to prison—not by em-
phasising its cruelties and terrors, but by
helping them to see that the world outside
was a better place to live in than gaol, and
by making it possible for them to do so,
even after more than one lapse into crime.
There is not room here to detail the measures
lie took to this end, but they may be sum-
med up in a few words. Strict discipline,
as little degradation as possible, unfailing-
justice, and useful work for the prisoner
were its essentials. More than anything else,
the idea of .reform, instead of revenge, was
relied upon to produce success. It is to
McCauley’s eternal credit that flogging for
breaches of prison discipline was abolished
as a result of his efforts. “Better,” he said,
“to hang a man than to flog him. He is
never any good afterwards.” And now, it
seems, is about to ensue, with regard to
the vacant position of Comptroller-General,
a little war of succession. The Acting
Comptroller-General, during McCauley's
long illness, has been D. G. D’Arcy, Superin-
tendent of the big establishment at Long
Bay—a man whose whole life has been spent
in the prison service, and whose qualifica-
tions for tlie principal position in it are
undoubted. He has been effectively schooled
by the late Comptroller-General in all tlie
intricacies of the system that the latter had
inaugurated, and during almost the whole of
this year has successfully run the Depart-
ment. But there are politicians who tire
of the racket and uncertainties of elections —
politicians whose party services have been
considerable, and whom party leaders may
not be unwilling to recompense. Tlie party
boss, though he may hate to part with use-
ful subalterns, sees in these appointments a
strengthening of the party machine. “Serve
the machine well,” such appointments say,
“and the machine will not forget you.”
Nothing, of course, could really be
more corrupt, and nothing could be more
unfair to the public service. That, indeed,
apart from tlie personal merits of candi-
dates for the now vacant position, is the
question with which Parliament and pubi e
are concerned. Is the advancement of party
interests to be put ahead of justice to the
public service? If justice to the service is
made a matter of secondary importance, then
we may make up our minds that the quality
of the service will certainly deteriorate.
“BlaCic Bonnet” : The police round up bf
abos. in Cooktown (N.Q.) district pro-
phesied by several Bulletin correspondents
is in full swing. Already one batch of
children, some of them little things of seven
or eight years, have been sent north to Cape
Bedford to be under the care and training
of Missioner Schwartz. All the blacks in
the district are terrified, being afraid that
their youngsters will be torn away from
them. At Helen Vale, between Rossville
and Cooktown, the abos., hearing that the
police were on the way from town, held a
meeting, at which three “kings” were pre-
sent, and decided seriously and pathetically
that there must be no more native mar-
riages. "What for we have piccanlnn es?
P’liceman lie steal ’em away! Black fella
have no more piccaninnies.” I wish every
man and woman in Australia could witness,
as I have done, the heart-breaking scene's
when these babies are taken from their
mothers. There would be such an outcry
against the fools who are harrying our van-
ishing brother to his doom as would make
the further persecution and deportation of

Randolph Bedford on the position in the
State that Ryan left: —-
The use of Knibbs’s figures showing percentage
increases in cost of living is quite unfair unless the
first figures—those before the increase—are given.
If one commodity rises from 15s. to 225. 6d. it has
been a 50 p.c. rise, but from 7s. 6d. to 15s. is 100
per cent. To say that Queensland living costs have
increased 62 per cent, is not conclusive in favor of
a higher living cost than in any otljer State, but
the following figures are conclusive the other way.
Knibbs takes, the capital cities and’ compares the
purchasing power of the pound sterling at 1914
with the costs of 1919 and the wage increases from
1914 to 1919. Here they are, showing Brisbane with
the lowest increase in living costs and the highest
increase in wages:—
Living »

Perth . . .. 30/10 62/2 70/7
Hobart . . . . 30/2 52/6 61/10
Of course Bedford’s figures are wrong.
Knibbs doesn’t say that what would have
cost 20s. in Brisbane in 1914 cost 28s. 6d.
in 1919. What he did say was that “what
would have cost on the average £1 in 1911
in the Australian capitals regarded as a
whole ” cost 28s. Gd. in Brisbane in the third
quarter of 1919. The goods may have cost
only 17s. Gd. in Brisbane in 1911 (not 1914).
So Bedford’s argument crashes on the very
rock that he says destroys the value of the
other comparison.
Some of the papers describe their signed
election articles as “written after consul-
tation.” Some of them say they were
“written after conference.” Most of them
read as though they were written after a
full meal.
Victorian Treasurer McPherson, who really
can make up his mind, sounded the British
Government on his recent borrowing visit to
London about doing away with the vulgar
ostentation of imported State Governors.
The British Government lives in chronic
wonderment as to why Australia wants im-
ported State Governors, seeing that the other
two Federations, Canada and South Africa,
don’t, and it can’t see why Australia should
be a painted harridan with six superfluous
paste necklaces while its sisters wear neat,
plain clothes. Its attitude was that if Mc-
Pherson’s chief, Lawson, would submit the
matter formally there would be no difficulty.
But Lawson couldn’t make up his mind, so
he cabled that he was doing the donkey act
between two haystacks, and he thought there
would be a convention of State Premiers
soon, and it might deal with the subject, and
would the British Government please
leave the billet unfilled for a while? The
general tenor of the reply was that if Law-
son couldn’t make up his mind, or had no
mind to make up, a new appointment would
be made in the usual course. That was some
weeks ago, and apparently Lawson hasn’t
got any nearer a conclusion yet. He will
die of hunger one of these days while trying
to decide whether to have chops or steak.
Dear old Archbishop Mannix would be a
really useful citizen if he could only forget
the shop once in a way. For instance, after
election day he rose to repudiate the charge
of sectarianism, but added that “Catholics
are one-fourth of the Commonwealth and
they have a right, if they desire, to one-fourth
of the things that Australia has to give.” It
is right enough and logical enough. But,
then, Protectionists are more than half the
Commonwealth and want half the assets, and
believers in compulsory military training are
a good half, and believers in the purity of
the white race amount to 90 per cent, at
least. And if they all get their fair share of
the goods, what is left for One Big Unionists,
importers and Imperial Federationists?
When a man holds that his little religion—-
political or social or sectarian religion—is
the watershed where all the streams divide,
and separates humanity into the people of
his shop and the people of other shops, he
has become very shoppy.
In old days when monarchs fought with
battle-axes in the thick of the scrum it
sometimes happened that bis Majesty was
dismounted at a crisis. Then the trooper
who gave up his horse and took his
chance among the plunging hoofs was re-
mem be red afterwards if the king survived
and won and was a decent sort of potentate.
Often the private was made ail Agent=
General or put on.a Land Board, The mis l
fdrtune 6f Con Wallace, who gave his. good
horse, West Sydney, tp the dismounted ftyaib
is that the king didn’t win., and Con failed
to catch the other hdrse he ptirsUed into
Nepean.
Of the Ballance Ministers who came info
power in Maoriland on the heels of the hiari-
time strike of ’9l and did things with ah
axe, none now remain in public lifo b¥fei ;
yonder. Ballance, Seddon, John McKenzie,
Cadman and Buckley are dead. Reeves,, the
originator of industrial arbitration, has Heed
settled in London for many years. He went
there as Agent-General. Jimmy Carroll and
Joe Ward took the knock last week.
As the Vic. State session was closing for
Christmas it looked as if Prendergast would
be allotted £2OO a year for his job as Opposi-
tion leader. Several of the other States had
already adopted the objectionable practice.
But that another State should do it, while
pretending to aim at the representation of
minorities —that is to say, at the breaking-up
of the two-party system—is a howling
anomaly.
Granville Ryrie, who, frankly because he
wasn’t there to ask for them, scored more
votes than any other candidate for the Reps.,
was a half-hearted N. S. Wales squatter till
the call came to enter politics. In Melbourne
he at once found one of his metiers in life.
He is a born politician of the back-slappiog
type:—a typo which, as in Ilyrie’s case,
usually features a powerful vein of subtlety.
The war gave him his chance in the busi-
ness for which he is best adapted of all. He
is a born leader of cavalry in the field.
More particularly Australian cavalry. He
has no pretensions to be an Intellectual:
his assets ate imperturbable calm and good
humor and the nervous system of a bullock.

The defeat of Joseph Ward and James Carroll
for the M.L. House of Reps, is remarkable. What-
ever Ward’s politics were, he had a personality
which could only be equalled in the M.L. Parlia-
ment by Timi Carroll. Ward started as a telegraph
messenger-boy, and worked up to Postmaster-
General—and more. Behind the force of “King
bick” Seddon were the slickness of Ward anti the
hard head of William Pember Reeves. Ward is
63, and although few know it, he was bfcjrn in
Melbourne. His first appearance in M.L. Parlia-
ment was in 1887, and since then he has been one of
the big features. Carroll, who entered the House the
same year, though he had previously served in it as
Maori interpreter, made a name for himself as a
boy in the early Maori wars, and was decorated.
An Australian writer said of him that he was
“the Deakin of Maoriland,” but that was not cor-
rect. Carroll had the fine language of Deakin —
probably more—but he had the gift also of calm
delivery. Carroll is one year younger than Ward,
and it will take a long time before the House
will settle to the loss of Ijis big, happy face.
D. C. McGrath, ex-Labor member and
lately Labor candidate for Ballarat, un-
folded a remarkable tale just before election
day. It seems that he was offered the post
of “Australian Defence Minister” in Lon-
don, at £2500 a year, as an inducement to
abandon his anti-conscription attitude;
but, “thank God,” he refused the jewelled
bait! Also he could have had a commis-
sion, but scorned it, like Caesar refusing the
half-crown offered him by Mark Antony, for
he preferred to “remain alongside the Dig-
gers.” The writer recalls that he, too, was
offered a peerage and the High Commis-
sionership on certain conditions by a per-
son in beer who said he was sent specially
by Hughes and Watt. However, McGrath
had other experiences of his own. He
lunched! at the House of Lords with two
peers and two members of the Commons,
and what these four wanted to arrange with
the gentleman who was “remaining along-
side the Diggers” was the handing over of
the control of Australian defences to Britain.
But McGrath was adamant. The Pyramids
were mere blubber by comparison. Even
castles and manors wouldn’t have tempted
him. Still, it seems a pity that McGrath
didn’t take the commission that was avail-
able and still “remain alongside the Dig-
gers.” Monash remained alongside, and so
did other commissioned folk. The whole
matter calls for inquiry under the law
(which is coming) for the Pi-evention of
Bogus Facts at Elections and the Disqualifi-
cation of Bogus Factors.

S. J. Carruthers, sec. of the Master
Retailers in Sydney, empties a cart-load of
figures into the daily papers to show, what
The Bulletin has been trying to show for
a year past, that the profiteer who matters
is the foreign profiteer. Carruthers quotes
half a hundred lines and compares “landed
cost price” to-day with those of 1914. For
example:—
1914. 1019.

And he declares that goods bought to-day
could not be landed at even the higher prices.
The old callous Freetrade idea was that the
foreigner was prepared to work for us in his
factory and his ship for next to nothing a
day and keep himself. He isn’t doing it any
longer. His wages have increased —in Eng-
land, at any rate —by anything up to 300
p.c., and freights are three times higher than
they were. Incidentally, while the foreign
workman is demanding and getting three
times more than he used to starve on, the
manufacturer, with more orders to fill than
he can handle, is taking his cut. And it is
all at the expense of shiftless countries like
Australia, which, in the words of f!«rwtko--
“have no control over the price of imported
goods” and “must pay the prices asaed oy
British and other manufacturers or shut up
shop.” Of course there is another alterna-
tive, but Carruthers isn’t concerned with it.
We might make these things ourselves.
Westralian Auditor-General’s report for
last year mentions some instances of fatherly
accommodation to pushful persons out of
the hard-up Treasurer’s advance account.
Two apparently-stranded Westralians
dropped in on the Agent-General and bor-
rowed a tenner, and another £250 was
advanced to departmental
officers to enable them to
buy motor-bikes and cars.
(To do them justice £l4l
of it has been repaid.)
There is a queer item of £l5
advanced to Ministers’ wives
for railway fares, but about
half of it has been squared.
In another case £55 was
advanced to a departmental
officer to pay the premium
on his life assurance, and
£2B of it is still owing.
Rubber planters in Malay
are getting anxious about
the future of the industry.
The latest development is
the intrusion of the Jap.
The Toyo Corporation, a
big Tokio affair, is buying
■up as many plantations as

;as it is backed by the

to do a lot of buying yet.
)i Taken in conjunction with
the huge purchases of war
metals earlier in the year,
and the recent attempt to
buy two of Germany’s best
Zeps., this scheme to secure
a supply of the war material
that the Hun mourned most
is a certain proof that Japan would not go
to war again even under the greatest provo-
cation. It wants these things to form a
war museum.
“Gallery” : On the present reading of the
election figures Hughes's earliest difficulty
will be to find suitable intellects to replace
the Cabinet casualties. None of the rank
and file are of anything like the calibre of
Watt, Greene, Groom or even Joe Cook, and
the most earnest regard for party solidarity
will yield Billy nothing more blinding than
Ryrie or Best. The only apparent alterna-
tive to raking among his untried and undis-
tinguished supporters is to lure Henry Hay-
whiskers into an entente permitting him a
voice in the Government. Yet, barring
McWilliams and Jowett, who both joined the
Farmers to save their lives, Haywhiskers
cannot produce a single obvious candidate
for Cabinet rank, unless Hughes creates a
new portfolio for Freetrade and Rebates, for
which every cocky would be patently eligible.
There is still the possibility that Hughes
may surrender the job to Watt after a grace-
ful interval, and remove the most fruitful
cause of dissension by helping himself to
Andrew Fisher’s job.
THE BACKFIRE.
Distressed Daughter : “ It's awful to think
of you profiteering these times when
everything is so dear. I don't know
why you couldn't have done it when
things were cheap."
It looks as though a lot more education
will have to be done before the referendum
gets a fair deal and will be worth using.
Thus far there have been 11 appeals to
the people of the Commonwealth, and every
time the answer has been No. A referen-
dum ought to be an appeal above party;
and so it is—on one side. A Government
is apt to have a referendum because it
thinks it well not to try to bind its sup-
porters. So they are given a free hand,
more or less. It was like that in the recent
referendum. But the Opposition never has
any doubts about the matter. Invariably it
instructs its supporters to vote No. So
between the Oppositionists, who vote No as
a matter of -course, and the Government
supporters, who vote No because they are
told they may. No is always carried. Labor
used to be the champion of the referendum.
But no party has done so much to destroy
it.
Part of the failure of Ryanism at Queens-
land Federal elections as compared with its
success at Queensland State elections may be
explained by the difference between the State
rolls that Ryan’s friend got up and the
Federal ones which were beyond their reach.
In the natural order of things the Senate
roll is the biggest of all rolls, for it admits
every adult British subject who has lived
for six months in any part of Australia,
while the qualification to get on the Queens-
land roll at last State contest was as high
as twelve months’ residence in that par-
ticular State. Therefore it was quite
natural that at the elections before the great
roll-stuffing there w r ere 368,207 Senate elec-
tors in Ryan’s State against 335,195 State
electors (State electors 33,012 behind),
whereas after the great roll-stuffing there
were 424,416 Queensland State electors
against 378,296 Senate electors (State elec-
tors 46,120 ahead). That may .have
accounted for the Ryan State victory in
1918.
Westralia’s railways are drifting from bad
to worse. For the past year they earned
£1,872,897, or £56,509 more than for the pre-
vious 12 months; but since expenses in-
creased by £116,257 the working profit
slumped from £365,054 to £305,306. Mean-
time Cohen’s bill is moving in the othei
direction, and as the interest on capital was
£665,100, the railways were run at a loss
to the State of £359,794. The deficit is
growing larger and larger and the total loss
for the past three years has been £963,660.
Almost 18 millions have been spent on the
3507 miles of line, and over 17 millions ot it
was loan money. The present deficit shows
up with interest calling for less than oj p.c.,
and when the loans fall due and have to oe
replaced at 6 p.c. or more, somebody or other
is going to feel very sick.
N.S.W. makes a specialty of being a nark
on Referendum Day. There had been 10
appeals to the people since 1910 (six Ques-
tions were submitted in one act on May 31,
1913) with these results: N.S.W. said ‘No
10 times; Victoria nine times; Tasmania
eight times; Queensland and S. Aus. four
times; Westralia said “Yes” every time;
Queensland and S. Aus. six
times each ; Tasmania twice ;
and Victoria had the saving
grace of saying it once —on
the first conscription day.
At this eleventh referen-
dum the Ma State is evi-
dently going to live up to
its old reputation, while
Westralia promises to give
its eleventh “Yes.” In the
10 votes the aggregate result
was “No” every time, and
Ma State’s “No” was always
the loudest.
A recent go-slow strike at
Port Adelaide State Produce
Depfit was based on the idea
of “job control” —the men on
the job or their union to boss
the work, the old bosses
being set aside as superflu-
ous ; to do it at their own
pace, under their own super-
vision and to their own satis-
faction ; to engage all labor;
the employers merely to pay.
It was set forth in print
that the employees were
thus to acquire, at other
people’s expense, “the neces-
sary experience, practice
and self-discipline in the
management of industries
preparatory to the working-
class taking over industries.”
But as all the people own
the Produce Depot, they
weren’t fascinated by the idea that they
should pay for training a little cheeky
oligarchy to steal it from them and start a
monopoly, so there was a lack of enthusiasm.
If Joe Ward refuses to take another
man’s seat in the M.L. Reps., his likeliest
successor as leader of the Liberal party is
W. H. I). Macdonald, from the Bay of
Plenty. He is a Scotchman, with over 30
years’ farming experience in the Shivery
Isles.
In theory the Federal F. and S. Party is
a compact little body pledged to get in front
of practically every measure of a democratic
or Protectionist nature. In practice its mem-
bers will be found to differ widely. For
example Falkiner (who may, however, not
be there) is a Freetrader and a Tory of the
1906 or Anti-Sosh vintage; he finds W. M.
Hughes as dangerous and as unendurable as
George Reid did Chris Watson. Alex. Hay
is a Protectionist; he has sat on platforms
with Hughes; and he is anything but Tory
in his industrial views. The only real point
of contact of all the members is a determi-
nation to keep the needs and interests of the
people on the land well advertised. “Hay-
seed first and forever best” is their slogan.
“Derwentside”: Tasmania’s hydro-electric
scheme having shown that large State enter-
prises can still be handled with business
acumen, the Speck, as the result of recent
Parliamentary authority, is about to attempt
to solve the shipping problem—and it is a
problem that affects the island vitally. The
treatment the State has received from the
shipping combine has been a scandal and a
disgrace. Now Parliament has authorised
the Government to build or purchase six
steamers for £500,000 to ply between the
mainland and the Speck and its islets. The
unfairness of the deal the latter have had is
illustrated by the fact that the most modern
vessel trading to Tasmanian ports, the
Loongana, is 17 years old, while the others
range from 25 to 43. Is it a wonder the
people buck ? The justification for the
steamers being owned by an insular country
like ours stands on solid grounds. It is
conceded by all, except a few cranks, that
the railways should be in the hands of the
people. And if it is the proper function of
the State to connect the producers of the
back country and their markets by rail, it
is equally Tasmania’s duty to provide a
State line to carry its producers’ goods to
their markets, which are on the mainland.

Muggs had a pain that would not go:
His spirits were extremely low
The pain persisted. In despair
Muggs (partly boiled) engaged ir. prayer.
He then tried groans. A martyr might
Have learnt new groans from him that night.
At last, when it was dawn, he flew
To see a doctor father knew.
He pressed the bell and groaned again,
One hand upon his precious pain.
The doctor listened and looked wise
While Muggs described his midnight cries.
“Suppose you smoke?” he asked at length.
"You DO? Well, smoking saps your strength!”
“Perhaps you drink when thirsty? Fie!
THAT’S where your stomach troubles lie!”
He then made Muggs poke out
his tongue;
On every word he said Muggs
hung.
He sat awhile in thought profound.
“Yes, yes! Well, now we’U look around.
"Please strip.” Muggs felt
inclined to whine.
The tyrant growled, “Say

‘Turn round!” Muggs turned.

It is 34 years since far-sighted James
Burns put this insurance co. into business as
a sort of side-line to the little shipping-
agency he had launched in Townsville 12
years previously. Later on, though by this
time quite separate, it followed its parent
to Sydney, and both have grown into very
big concerns. And they are still growing.
Premium income of the insurance co. last
year was almost exactly three times what
it was only nine years ago, and operations
have extended so widely that the business
handled outside Australia is now not far
short of that done within the Commonwealth.
Which means that this co.’s reputation has
become so favorably known abroad, par-
ticularly in the Near North, that handsome
profits from outside insurers are at last
pouring into Australian pockets. Share-
holders in overseas offices have so long been
fed by Australian policy-holders that it is
cheering to see an Australian office making
good a little of the big leakage. Only within
recent years have the locally-owned insur-
ance cos. been getting anything like the sup-
port they have deserved, and there are still
many Australians lacking sufficient patriot-
ism to place their insurances with their own
offices, which can offer often better protec-
tion than many of their overseas competitors
—and not small offices either.
Take, for example, the multi-millionaire
concern which has resulted from the amalga-
mation of the Liverpool and London and
Globe Cos. and the Royal. Combining the
figures of these two big offices, both of them
beyond reproach, for their last financial year,
and excluding life business, capital and re-
serves approximated 20| millions. Premiums
for the year amounted to £15,800,000, so,
apart from debenture stock, the mammoth
concern had funds equal to 128 p.c. of the
year’s premiums ; or, if the debenture stock
be included, 141 p.c. By comparison the
Queensland is only a small affair, but its
risks are proportionately smaller. It has a
paid capital of £350,000 and reserves of
£279,544 —together, £629,544 of funds. Last
year’s premium income was a record,
£373,146; but for every £IOO of premiums
collected the Queensland had £166 of funds.
From this point of view, then, the
Australian office was stronger than its big
English competitor. Look at the Queens-
land’s position in another way. After pay-
ing current divs. there wei-e funds available
to meet claims equal to the entire losses of
the past five war years, and then leave
£25,000 to spare, without taking into
account current premiums. Other local offices
offer somewhat similar strong protection to
their policy-holders, so there can be no excuse
on the score of safety for the insurer who
sends his good money out of the country.
Here is the underwriting record of the*
Queensland Insurance Cos. over the past
quarter of a century:—
Loss Expense
Premiums. Losses. Expenses. Rate. Rate.
1895. . £40,681 £28,703 £ 13,058 70.7 p.c. 32.1 p.c.

1916.. 262,675 121,746 93,320 46.3 „ 35.5 „
1917.. 271,416 113,472 103,184 41.8 „ 38.0 „
1918.. 308,148 109,105 101.533 35.4 „ 32.9 „
1919.. 373,146 142,249 135,609 38.1 „ 36.3 „
The premium figures are nowadays shown
in the balance-sheet less a clip for unearned
premiums reserve, apparently £7414 for the
past year, and this amount has been included
in the table to make the figures uniform for
purposes of comparison. How very profitable
business has been to the co. lately can be seen
by contrasting the latest premium income
and the percentage of underwriting surplus
with earlier years. Going back to 1910 —a
favorable year—the loss rate was then 10.4
p.c. more and the expense rate 2.2 p.c. more.
In other words, the margin of profit last
year had improved to 25.6 p.c. of premium
income compared with 13 p.c. nine years ago ;
and that extra 12.6 p.c. on £373,000 alone
puts £47,000 more into the co.’s coffers. Or,
to put it another way, the profit resulting
from the more favorable underwriting experi-
ence lias, during the past couple of years,
been more than sufficient to provide the
handsome dividends which have been distri-
buted.
Shareholders, of course, have done remark-
ably well. Paid capital 10 years ago was
only £75,000, and it was- receiving 8 p.c.
divs. Since then £275.000 of reserves have
been capitalised and 124 p.c. is being paid
on the lot. So the shareholder of 10 years’
standing is now getting a return of 584 P ; c.
p.a. on his old capital. Of the £43,750 dis-
tributed for the past year, all but £6435 was
provided by interest earnings, practically the
whole of the underwriting surplus thus being
available for strengthening reserves.
This shows how the assets figures have
expanded during the past five years :

be most readily available, without great sac-
rifice of principal, in the event of sudden
large demands.

The success of the Fourth Victoria, since it
emerged from the dust of the ’nineties, has
been its profound faith in the future. It
was not so badly rattled as many were in
the big smash, but it had a*lot of holes to
fill, and 2 p.c. divs. were the best it could
hand out 20 years ago. Believing that the
future was all right, and being strong
enough to do some foster-mothering, it ac-
quired all that was left of the Lygon, Pre-
mier, South Melbourne, City of Prahraji
and Planet building societies. Both its
judgment and its luck were good—so good
that, last year, after paying 8 p.c. on termi-
nating shares, it showed a net profit equal
to nearly 18 p.c. on its permanent capital.
Just after the war started the co. had
£542,427 out in advances; then for several
years the management proceeded cautiously,
and 12 months ago only £452.665 was out.
Now the co. again shows its faith by advanc-
ing the whole of last year’s repayments and
£149,303 besides, making total loans £601.968.
To undertake this new business £107.276
more has been got in from depositors and an
additional 1528 £2O terminating shares have
been issued. The principal balance-sheet
figures are larger than they have been at
any time: —

Cash, etc 2,479 15,024 17,296
No doubt caution has been exercised in tak-
ing on new business, for there has been such
a rush of borrowers that the co. should have
been able to pass anything that looked doubt-
ful. Still, considering the artificial condi-
tions ruling—the Commonwealth is, of course,
experiencing the apparent prosperity result-
ing from a war fought on lOU’s and an in-
flated currency—the placing of so much new
loan business on the books looks daring. It
is new business which creates gaps if trouble
does happen along, for every instalment paid
by a borrower lightens the risks on that
particular business by widening the margin
between the amount of loan and the value of
the security. In any case, the Fourth Vic-
toria is in a better position to trust to the
future than most building concerns, for it
has solid reserves. Permanent capital is
£115046 and terminating shares have put
£31.365 into the business ; but visible reserves
amount to no less than £118,162, and there
may be internal reserves, too.
The directors believe that they have at last
got the co. into so comfortable a position
that securities call for no further writing
down. From the point of view of creditors
the position certainly looks sound. There
are £712.293 of written-down assets to meet
total liabilities of £442,S09; which means
that assets all round would have to lose
38 p.c. of their present book value before the
co. would, have to deny creditors a full 20s.
in the £. Shareholders, too, are on a good
wicket; and the old hands deserve it, for
their pluck in striking out at a time when
other people were still afflicted with cold
feet. The new business put on the books
lately has, presumably, been more profitable
than earlier transactions. So, if the future
works out all right, something more than
8 p.c. divs. might be looked 'for, particularly
in view of the wide margin of profit beyond
present dividend requirements.

Of that £2303 of profit shown for the half-
year. £951 came from the sale of plant no
longer required, so results were compara-
tively much poorer than the figures in the
table would indicate. ’Flu had a lot to
do with the falling-off, but heavier costs
also made a cut, for apparently there was
very little passing-on to make good the gradu-
ally-increasing exes. Gross profits from
manufacturing and trading decreased from
£7496 to £5938. while exes, were only £472
less. With the latest minimum-wage troubles
it is certain that the light-luncher and the
afternoon-tea sipper will have to be asked
for a little more, and as most of the
co.’s customers have participated in
the all-round increase in wages there seems
no reason why better results should not
again show up. Since the co. shook off its
old troubles it has done very well, disclos-
ing a net profit emial to almost 18 p.c. of
the written-down capital. And that was
after providing so liberally for depreciation
of plant, etc., that the directors now state
that those assets are worth more than their
book value, and consequently there is no
necessity to make any provision out of the
past half’s surnlps for depreciation. Inci-
dentally, the £951 surplus on sale of plant
has been set as ; de in a special reserve, to
be “placed against plant or otherwise as
the directors think fit.” Less than a year
ago the directors acquired a freehold near
Circular Quay, where it was proposed to
open a new branch: but apparently the
directors have changed their minds, and the
property has been sold. Since the sale of
plant and property had not been final-
ised when the accounts closed on Sept. 30.
the sundry debtors and creditors items both
show a consid Q rab 1 e inflation. Going back
to just after the clean-up. the balance-sheet
figures have moved this way :—

Liquid assets .. .. £11,159 £26.439
Liabilities . . . . 12,330 25,804
Excess liabilities . . £1,171

That shows an improvement of £1806 in
18 months after distributing 10 p.c. divi-
dends; and that is a satisfactory movement
for. a co. with a po’d canital of £24.500
which has been rapidly extending its busi-
ness, resulting in an increase of £1183 in
the book value of fixed assets over the same
period.

This co. has had another very good year. After
writing off p.c. of the book value of plant
and machinery, almost 12 p.c. off furniture
and fittings, and meeting the expenses of
manager Andrew Wilson’s round-the-world t
inspection of other factories in the same*
line of business, net profits were equal to
164 p.c. of paid capital. The co. has been
going 10 years, though the concern had its
beginnings as a proprietary in lo9i. y°fi'
siderable expansion of the balance-sheet
figures has taken place since the first
accounts were presented :

Book debts cash,etc. 7,331 9,407 14,155 12,723
The co. began with £9500 of its capital
represented by goodwill, and during its first
year a further £I2OO of deferreds were issued
to the ordinaries in consideration for their
allowing the prefs. to rank equally for divi-
dends. This share issue, however, was paid
for out of the first year’s surplus profits.
Since October, 1910.. £8270 of new capital
has been got in, but stocks are now so expen-
sive and the business has grown to such an
extent that the management is working on
an overdraft of £10,274 and owes £11,304
besides, liabilities having expanded by
£17,430 in the nine years. On the other
side, the hook value of more or less liquid
assets has gone from £14,164 to £43,518; so
the liquid surplus has improved from £10,016
in 1910 to £21,940 at the latest balance.
Meantime £9615 has been added to the book
value of premises and'plant. Over the nine
years the co.’s position has thus been visibly
improved by £13.269 after paying dividends
averaging over 84 p.c. per annum —a very
good performance for a co. with a paid capi-
tal of £37,200.

That gives Tongkah Harbor’s record from
the beginning; and what a sweet thing Cap-
tain Miles put his Ilobart jam friends on to
when he coaxed them to form the syndicate
which pasted its IXL label on his find!
To date 12,230 tons oxide has brought in
£1.418.604. During the past five years alone
£202,500 has been distributed in dividends
on a paid capital of £150,000. Of course,
the co. has lately been helped by a very
favorable tin market, and during 1918 every
cubic yard treated showed a working profit of
more than 10Id. —three times more than was
earned two years previously. This gives the
war record of the concern in another way :

The grade of ground treated nowadays is not
nearly what it used to be, for in the begin-
ning average recoveries were as high as
141 b. per yd., and 1916 was the first year in
which they got below .9. The average for
one of the five dredges last year was over
the lb. r but that was at an exposed spot
where a run for shelter was necessary when
the barometer dropped. Another dredge
averaged .91b. inshore; two others were on
fib. stuff ; but the year’s average was pulled
down by the plant which was part of the
time cleaning out the Government channel
and afterwards oil a narrow, difficult strip,
an average of only .411 b. being got from over
half a million yards handled. So far the co.
has worked just over 600 acres of its 5350-
acre concession ; but it is not going to be easy
'sailing on the big area untouched. Most of
it has not been even prospected; but sea-
ward from the present furthest-out workings
bores put down by general-manager Eliot
Lewis have not disclosed good values, though
owing to deep and rough water he was un-
able to recover full samples. Anyhow, as
deep-sea tin-fishing is not a job for the
smaller dredges Tongkah decided that
it had better look for some inshore
ground to keep them going; so the Bang
Tao property, 256 acres 20 miles away,
has been acquired, and Lewis hopes
to make a start there soon. Nothing is said
about the value of this .show, but as the
Chinese vendors are to get 15 p.c. royalty on
gross winnings, and there is also the heavy
Government duty to meet, Tongkah must
have faith in the value of the ground.
At September 30 the co. owed £10,260 and
had £75,085 in very liquid assets, mostly War


The advantage of having battery charging current
on tap in the home garage is now within the reach
of every motorist. The G.E. Mercury Arc Battery
Charger makes any ordinary lighting circuit a source
of energy for starting, lighting, and ignition bat-

only increase the efficiency of a battery, but will
also lengthen the life of the plates. You should

capital provided by the State to start with

N. S. Wales Board of Trade has at last
persuaded Holman to appoint a Commission
to inquire into certain “occupational”
diseases, particularly miners’ phthisis and
pneumonia. The Broken Hill cos. offered
to share the cost of an inquiry ; but Holman
was opposed to that, and doubted whether
the Government could afford to do the job
single-handed. Eventually a modified scheme
was prepared, and Professor Chapman, of
Sydney Uni., will carry it through at an
estimated cost of £4OOO.
The Broken Hill strike, or what there is
left of it, continues on its weary way. The
only thing that keeps the mines from operat-
ing as usual is the mule-like obstinacy of
the A.M.A. in sticking to its absurd demands
and refusing to countenance any measure
which smells of arbitration. Other unions
have already made the best of a bad job by
taking all that they can get, and have
expressed their willingness to resume work
in full strength at any moment. Already
about 1600 men are employed along the line
of lode. With the powerful Laborers’ Union
in dead opposition to'its policy of Suicide,
and the Federated Enginedrivers and Fire-
men’s Association sick of existing methods,
not to mention other and smaller associa-
tions being fed up with the doctrine of Kerr
and his stalwarts, the A.M.A. is pretty well
discredited. Incidentally, the N. S. Wales
coalminers are displaying anxiety to unload
themselves of the burden of £.1500 a week
in levies for their Broken Hill brothers, and
circulars are flying broadcast over the
eastern States on behalf of the Barrier
engine-drivers and other bodies, asking for
financial assistance to help them “fight the
tyranny of the A.M.A.” With a pile of
debts and about 3000 men with their wives
and families hungry, the heads of the A.M.A.
are frenziedly seeking a way out without
making themselves look too ludicrous. The
end of the foolish regime of “direct action”
on the Barrier is near at hand.

Vegetable Creek has a good record for the
current year. Production has been 365 tons
of 75| p.c. tin oxide as against 2614 tons for
1918. Dividends for the year totalled ss.
on 135,000 shares, or £33,750 on the sub-
scribed capital of £109,687. Dividends to
date, £103,500; paid to landowners £25,000
plus interest; with £20,000 spent on pros-
pecting work. Cash assets amount to £7OOO,
so the mine has made profits in excess
of the subscribed capital. The co. was regis-
tered in 1910, but it was not until 1915 that
it appeared in the dividend list. The high-
est net return for 754 p.c. oxide received
this year was £2OB per ton, when the for-
vvard price in London was £237 on this basis,
or £315 for metallic; the lowest return was
£143 per ton, w'hen London price was jqual
*o £l7O. These figures show that there is
considerable profiteering somewhere. There
is an air of mystery as to the prospects of
the mine. People who should know say that
the ore reserves are in excess of those re-
ported by the manager in April last, owing
to satisfactory developments in the Gordon
section; but there is no official confirmation
of this. It is also said that the director's
have decided to exercise options on three
other properties which have been sampled;
but officially there is oyster-dumbness on
this subject. Apart from outside shows the
present deep-lead should ensure the co. a
long life. The mine was declared to be
“worked out” in 1916 and, probably it will
be “worked out” many times, in the same
sense, before the miles of untouched lead
are systematically explored.
The Cowra crowd which got hold of old
Milburn Creek, Woodstock (N.S.W.). when
the amended Mining Act abrogated the old
title a few months ago, has only just secured
a lease. The property has been held by
one Haege, who since the war has not beeix
available for the sei’ving of notices, and the
new people had some difficulty in digging out
his attorney. Now, however', everything is
in order, and the syndicate is proceeding to
form a development co. of £15,000 in 750
shares of £2O each, 375 fully-paids going to
the vendors, 125 contribs. held in reserve, and
the other 250 offered for subscription.
Cowra people have promised to put up a lot
of the £SOOO. The mine has not been
worked for about 40 years, but it once fur-
nished some rich ore; the 14454 tons raised
in 1876 was distributed between two treat-
ment cos., the averages working out at 11
and 18 p.c. copper. Since the syndicate
took over very little work has been done
pending the granting of the lease, but, in
addition to re-timbering, three men have got
out 160 tons since the middle of August for
14| tons copper. The Electrolytic Cos. is
contracting to take the output, with the old
dumps, which may put a few pence into the
co.’s till. There are six old shafts on the
lode, and most of them can be repaired. Off
the main shaft at 100 ft. there is an Bft. body
from which 9.3 p.c. ore has been sent to the
smelters, and from 300 ft. a parcel gave 8.5
p.c. W. C. Easdown, who has had his eye
on the show since he was in shorts
and is now running it, considers it
likely that both lots of ore are from the one
body; if so, there seems a probable 7500 tons.
However, lie is setting out to prove this end
of the property by intermediate levels. With
the main shaft down 300 ft., and development
work in good ore, the syndicate feels pleased
with its chances. Several offers of purchase
have been made, but the new crowd isn’t a
seller.

Itatrut, the Sydney co. which is chasing
tin in West Siam, is out with its accounts
to May 81 last. Here is the co.’s record
since dredging began :
Tin Values Costs
Handled, oxide, lb. per per
cub.' yd. tons. cub. yd. cub. yd.
1917 . . 492,000 182.7 .83 3.92 and.

1919 . . 760,000 329.5 .97 5.20 and.
Total revenue for last year was £60,543,
or £5722 more than for 1918 ; but the little
Siamese is an expert tax-gatherer, and Itat-
rut had to hand out £12,302 in duty. After
meeting all exes, in Siam and Sydney, and
allowing for depreciation, a net profit of
£27,557 showed up, of which £20,000 was
passed out to shareholders, equal to 20
p.c. on paid capital. Since the accounts
closed 314.000 cub. yds. have given 146 tons
oxide, and on tlie strength of this a fur-
ther £IO,OOO has been paid, making £55,000
distributed since May, 1917, on a capital of
£IOO,OOO. During the year manager Yetts did
a lot of close boring, and the results are not
so bright as some people expected. At the
eastern end of the property the wash was so
stony and old-time workings so numerous that
Yetts won’t venture an opinion as to whether
the area is payable. Later on he intends
to head the dredge into this ground and
allow it to decide. Still, he adds that “there
will be no difficulty in turning the dredge
into profitable ground again in the event
of low values being encountered.” Further,
south of the present workings, according
to the bores, a big slice of ground will have
to be passed by because of its patchiness and
heavy clay overburden. No attempt is made
to estimate for shareholders the area likely
to be lost to the co. in this way. Still there
is a considerable area of good ground ahead.
The co. is understood to have practically
completed negotiations for the acquisition of
a further area adjoining its present holding.

Golden Butterfly is making its fourth
effort to get hold of anew mine in the West.
This time it is buying the Banker, near
Southern Cross, for £3500. The co. has the
resources to purchase this show, but more
money will have to be found for plant,
development, etc. However, the co. has
fluttered to a field of many disappointments,
and there is no evidence that it has got hold
of anything out of the way in value. A
report by aji expert of standing is wanted
to inspire confidence. The Butterfly has
also acquired a block near Slavin’s, at
Hampton Plains, but so far nothing of any
value has been disclosed.
A venturesome co., supposed to hail .from
Sydney, is about to start gold-mining at
Black Flag (W.A.). This place was lively
enough at one time, but its reefs, though
big, were ptfor, and for many years it has
been almost dead. One mine, from which
much was expected, was floated in London
for hundreds of thousands by Rudolph Hen-
ning and others, but after a 50-hd. mill
had handled a few thousand tons of ore the
co. gave up.
* * * *
Bullfinch Pty. has good hopes of the new
find pegged out by Charlie Jones at Wom-
bola, 30 miles east of Kalgoorlie. A direc-
tor is on his way from London to look at
it, and, if prospects warrant, anew co. may
be formed to work the show. At present a
little work, principally costeening, is being
done on a big quartz and ironstone forma-
tion, from which values up to an ounce are
reported to have been obtained.
Ivalgoorlie tributors are demanding better
terms. Under some of the existing agree-
ments they have to hand over 40 p.c.
o'f the gross value of gold won, and although
some manage to do well even on these stiff
terms there are a lot who do not. The con-
ditions under which work is carried on also
need looking into.
The poor report recently issued by Cele-
bration Junction staggered boosters of the
stock. Values in the property have been
very spotted, and figures reported by the
management may be accepted as fair average
to date.
* * * *
From 2581 tons, Rose, Thistle and Sham-
rock, Of Bright (Vic.), got gold worth £10.3<6
in its last six months, so was able to pay a
Is. div. and spend £4200 in mine work.
This meant that all the stone got out of the
Bandtax snaft and Nos. 1 and 2 levels went
the ounce. Bandtax shoot is carrying down
well in the underlie shaft, for at the bottom
it shows 6ft. of good stone; but the plain
truth is that no amount of puff can make
it a big affair. Would it not have been
better policy to have put off the div. and
opened up more levels underfoot, or to have
spent some cash in getting ahead of the
water and other troubles at the Shamrock
shaft? For until manager Proctor piles up
ore reserves in the Shamrock section to back
up the Bandtax ore, he cannot claim to pos-
sess more than a minor show.
* * * *
“G.D.M.’s” plea for the restoration of Vic.
gold mining:—
The remedy for inflation of currency is to in-
crease production, and particularly the production of
gold. In Australia the remedy for an inflated cur-
rency is close to hand, because we can increase our
supply of gold. The Federal Government foolishly
permits the gold-producers to export their gold and
get the world’s price of £5 10s. an ounce. An
embargo ought to be placed on the export of gold
until such time as our currency has been deflated.
That’s the first step. And as the second step no more
notes should be issued by the Federal Treasury.
Already there are £56,000,000 of notes in existence,
and if we want to get back to a normal condition in
finance and trade we must stop increasing the issue,
stop borrowing here or abroad, and gradually- reduce
our swollen currency.
We want more gold, and ought to bestir our-
selves to open our abandoned mines, many of them
abandoned because the stone became too poor to pay
with worn-out machinery and out-of-date mining
methods. There are plenty of mines containing large
quantities of '5-, 6- and 7-dwt. ore, which can be
profitably worked with modern machinery. Take
Clunes (Vic.) by way of illustration. Here is a
small town in goinjf order. There is no pioneering,
no building, no prospecting, no shaft-sinking to be
done before gold can be won. Up to 1892 about
a dozen cos. had produced five millions’ worth of
gold in 35 years from six reefs, £2,000,000 of it
clear profit. And, of course, there were no reserve
funds’. The New North Clunes mine took out
500,000 tons ore worth half an ounce to the ton,
while the last recorded crushing went 124dwt. The
Clunes Quartz Cos. crushed 1,204,000 tons for
486,2070 z., or an average of 7dwt. 14gr. The total
capital paid up was £21,550, and the amount distri-
buted in divs. and royalties £481,455. Work was
stopped by rising water, and (tell it not in Gath !) the
mine had only one 10-inch pump! Nothing much has
been done below 900 ft. The whole of the water
in these 12 mines was reckoned to be 500,000
gallons a day, and between them there were only
four 10-inch pumps on the whole field. The South
Clunes Cos. raised £513,649 worth of gold from
its upper levels. The Old Man reef was 30 to 50
feet thick, and gold-bearing. This was the last
mine to close down through the influx of water
from neighboring mines, and it only had two 10-inch
pumps going one shift a day. Generally speaking,
the greatest quantity of ground worked in any of
the mines was above 600 ft. Only a little ore has
been taken out between 600 and 900 feet, and
below 900 practically nothing. Therefore virgin
ground probably exists for two miles in length.
Without sinking any new shafts, except, perhaps, a
central pumping shaft, at least 10,000,000 tons
quartz are available. The Clunes mines stopped
work to discuss an amalgamation so as to cope with
the increasing water. The negotiations fell through
and the miners were swamped out. The gold is
still there in big low-grade bodies, easily mined and
milled, worth from 5 to 7 dwt. The Buninyong
field is another instance of neglected resources,
and, like Clunes, is sure to be re-opened. Why not
now?

Some figures published about the Sardine
tin show, 90 miles from Charters Towers
(N.Q.), got tangled on the way. Angus
McCallum, chairman of the syndicate which
has an option over the property, reports
that one crushing of 84 tons gave’ 25 tons
black tin. and from the last lot of 95 tons
crushed 37 tons black tin was won. Since
September 25 the syndicate has raised a
further 168 tons reckoned to be equally high-
grade. The shaft is down about 80ft., and
in ore, the lode averaging about 6ft. Open-
ing up north and south from the bottom of
the shaft has exposed 32ft. rich ore averag-
ing 4ft. and going strong underfoot.

Queensland’s gold yield for the 11 months
to November 30 was 12,4630 z. (fine) less
than in the same eleven-twelfths of 1918, and
that meant a slide of almost £53,000 in value.

At Perth the other night a dinner was
given by the Caledonian Society to honor St.
Andrew. Early in the proceedings MacCal-
lum Smith, M.L.A., the chairman, read a
telegram of greeting from the Highland
Society of Sydney. This was rather a long
effort, and, as several references had been
made during the evening to Scawtch pairsi-
mony, Prof. Ross resurrected the message,
far exceeding the sixteen-word limit, as proof
that their Scotch brithers in Sydney, at any
rate, could not be accused of the national
idee. “Hey, mon,” interrupted MacCallum
Smith, “but it’s mairked ‘collect.’ ”

“Emgee” : Filling in the war-leave papers
makes me think of the time I pushed a
quill for the State War Council. Enlistment
cards were being gone through, and the usual
questions as to name, address, occupation,
etc., checked. One card had opposite the
question, “State in which enlisted” ; “Strictly
sober.” *
“Wage Slave”: Port Pirie Recorder
began to wonder what the damages would
be the other day when it found that it had
published an ad. giving the interesting but
false information that a local couple, who
had been married only two months, had been
awarded twins. After a heated interview
with the newly-wedded pair and their soli-
citor, the Recorder paid £lO to go on with,
and agreed to run the culprit to earth if
possible. The police transacted the latter
business in a few hours, with the result that
next morning a relation of the lady who had
not had twins appeared in the police comt
charged with criminal libel. Hereabouts the
relation who had invented the twins pleaded
that the whole thing was a joke, and as the
family did not want to hear any more about
the matter the Recorder was persuaded to
take its £lO back and induce the Law, even
if it couldn’t see the joke, to at least forget
that it had made a criminal charge.
“P.X.”: An order of Justice Rich,
of the High Court, is not one which
newspapers can read with any satis-
faction. In Ryan v. the Argus £lO,OOO
was asked for and a farthing was
awarded by a jury. But because the de-
fence admitted a technical libel and had not
gone into the box to justify it, the Judge,
notwithstanding the contemptuous damages,
ordered defendant to pay costs —presumably
the costs of the two hearings. The moral for
newspapers seems to be: “No admissions,
unless you’ve made them beforehand and
withdrawn and apologised.” As to the wis-
dom of making admissions at a trial, it is
just as well to remember that a jury doesn’t
consist of barristers. Counsel can find a
technical libel where the intelligent layman
can detect nothing out of the way. Justice
ivich’s order is a reminder to papers that if
they follow counsel’s opinion and admit a
technical libel, they not only make it im-
possible for a jury to find for the
defendant, but also leave it open to a Judge
to strike them heavily for costs notwithstand-
ing that, judging by the contemptuous dam-
ages awarded, it may in the jury’s opinion
have been an action that should never have
been brought.

“Almanac” delivers a kick :
Visiting a sick friend in one of Melbourne’s pub-
lie hospitals I discovered a pub-
lic nuisance. Wearing the regu-
lation wire whiskers and black
tie of Gloom, he pushed him-
self into our little gathering
at the patient’s beside, and
holding forth a flabby paw, ex-
pressed himself as being hope-
ful that the sick person was
bearing his afflictions like a
Christian. He held the floor
for five minutes with this sort
of cant, and finished up by
censoring the literature which
we had brought for our sick
friend’s amusement. The per-
formance was repeated at every
bed, and the running was taken
up by his buskers—harmonium
and all complete. Their part
of the performance was to cheer
up the patients with a selec-
tion of Moody and Sankey. The
leader of the troupe is a well-
known commercial man, and the
hospital authorities never ques-
tion their right to interrupt pri-
vate conversations and use up
visiting time. Can't something
be done to eradicate this sort of pest from public
institutions on general visiting days?

From Macquarie-street:—
Through the ignorance and apathy of the various
States of Australia with regard to preventive
medicine and biological research, it has been re-
served for the London School of Tropical Medicine
to send out a scientific expedition having its base
at Funafuti with a view to putting in two years
in the study of the numerous fly- and mosquito-
carried diseases in their natural home. It was
stated at the annual meeting of the School that
great hopes were entertained of Dr. O’Connor and
his colleagues being able to fill up the gaps that
exist in the life-history of the various filarise, a
nematode worm that is suspected of being the cause
of one variety of elephantiasis, so horribly prevalent
in parts of the Pacific. One of these gentry has
long borne (1872) a name well known in Queensland
medical anrals —the Filaria bancrofti. With such a
wealth of material at our very doors it is truly re-
markable that no attempt was ever made in this
country to throw further light on the absorbingly-
interesting diseases that are so plentiful a few days’
sail from our shores. For instance, malaria is
very common at Bougainville, and very rare in the
Gilbert and Ellice groups. Why? Malaria, elephan-
tiasis, filariasis and bacillary dysentery all want
investigating, and while we have the men with the
requisite knowledge and imbued with the true scien
t’fie spirit, initiative and money have been lacking,
so that now, having missed our chance, we will
have to take a back seat and watch the represen-
tatives of the Old Country reap the honor and
glory. Even in such an important disease as pul-
monary tuberculosis, the Medical Journal of Aus-
tralia has to admit that we have made no serious
effort to grapple with it. And yet we are Pioneers
of the Air!
THE OPTIMIST.
“Here, get out of this —the hotel's on fire!”
“ S’all right, m’dear, I’m too wet to burn.”
“10-2-4”: I struck a new brand of fakir
on a Sydney ferry-steamer the other after-
noon. He wore an li.S. badge, and carried
a home-made machine —a contrivance, seem-
ingly, of wire and drain-pipes. On this he
beat out “Boys of the Dardanelles” —one
could recognise the intention by the time.
Startled, I turned to another badge-wearer
beside me. “I’m a bit deaf, lad,” I said,
“and I know it. Tell me, for God’s sake, if
it’s even worse than I thought. Is there any
tune at all in that instrument?” “Abso
lutely none,” he yelled. “It’s a out-
rage. A ought to have more
respect for his self than to come at
such a game. Why can’t the —— get
work?” In certain quarters the R.S. badge
is developing into a sort of trench : men do
things behind it that they would not dare
to adventure in the open.

“Wheatstone”: It was in January, 1916,
at Lincoln (Eng.) that I met the chances
of war. The first batch of comforts had
arrived, and the excitement was intense. We
shuffled along in a queue to the sergeant-
major’s office, and on the lucky-dip system
(the s.-m. being the dipper, - ), I emerged with
a fly net. The snow was 2ft. deep.
Tired of their Victorian College of
Divinity, chartered by Act of Parliament
various academic “heads” went to Education
Minister Hutchinson the other day
and asked for the knocking out of
the two words “except divinity” in
the Uni. Act, so that that workshop
might, if it liked, turn out pulpit-
eering doctors and bachelors, just as
Queensland and W. A. ’Varsities can
The time was opportune, it was
urged, as there was a Uni. Reform
Bill before the Assembly. Hutchin-
son raised the point whether the set-
ting up of a faculty would not amount
to a State subsidy of Protestantism;
but the deputation, after looking
verra hurt for a moment, said it was
sure the churches would pay the bill.
It was admitted that the late Arch-
bishop Carr had been consulted when
it was proposed to set up a College
of Divinity, and he had wished the
project well, although he had no use
for it; but it hadn’t been thought
necessary to consult Archbishop Man-
nix on this occasion. Of course
Mannix flared up. He objected to
the Uni., which was free to all sects,
having a special preserve for some
denominations. And that was the end
of the matter for the present, nobody
beinv anxious to risk the Uni. Reform
Bill by introducing a wasp or other insect
to the debate, seeing the session had only a
few days more to run.

Ryan’s Thousand and Ryan’s Ten Thou-
sand both missed fire. The Thousand was,
so far as is known, 924 men short, and the
Ten Thousand was £9999 19s. lli’d. short.
The jury, which was told that technically
it must find for Ryan in his libel action
against the Argus, and which gave him
id. damages, admittedly meant to be
“contemptuous.” and was as much so as the
resources of the coinage would admit. In
China it might have done better. There is
some really contemptuous small change in
China; in fact, there are coins that amount
to reprobation, if not loathing.
“Port Fairy”: The housewife who can
seldom purchase a fish in Melbourne for less
than Is. ought to know that the fishermen
have their saleable catches regulated—in
other words, are told how much will be
bought. And the quantity has
been lately reduced; for every
eight baskets of fish taken at
the time when the Fish Com-
mission sat, only five are now
purchased. And the fisherman
can’t even sell his five-basket catch
at adequate rates: two local men lately
cleared only 4s. 2d. each for a con-
signment of 29 baskets! Can’t anything
be done to “straighten” the Dagoes who
handle this trade? Of course it can. Will
it? Apparently it won’t!
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Dr. Fiasehi,
native of the Hawkesbury district, has
bought old Government House at Windsor
and presented it to the Australian Historical
Society. It is the third oldest building in
Australasia, erected, according to Governor
Hunter’s list, in 1799. In 1854 it was sold
by public auction, and has since been in
private hands.

“Staff Captain” : We were the last Austra-
lian infantry in action on the Western Front,
and rang down the curtain by taking the vil-
lage of Montbrehain on October 5, 1918. A
number of prisoners were bagged, and my
job was to see that they were all passed
down quickly to the collecting station. Every-
thing was going well, when through my
glasses I saw what appeared to be the
smallest Hun in captivity. He was in no
hurry nor was his Digger escort. As they
approached I noticed that every Digger
near by left his immediate job, examined
the prisoner and doubled up with laughter.
I grew curious, and approached the new
joke. He was a pocket-edition, not more than
ROMANCE.

BALLADE OF LADIES IN DISTRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When hubby, coming home, espies
His wife in arms she should not know,
What time the loveliglit in her eyes
Singes the stranger’s flaxen mo.,
He swiftly smites him, and the blow
Shatters the household’s strongest mail';
The husband laughs a harsh “Ho! Ho;” —
But what redress have ladies fair?
The villain naturally dies,
And J. Hops take their man in tow;
But when the twelve good men arise
And give their judgment on him, though
They know him guilty they will show
They like a bloke to do and dare ;
The law unwritten bids him go—
But what redress have ladies fair?
If Enid finds her husband lies
Of working late, that eyes of sloe
Have won his heart, and love-lorn sighs
Sing to the false Lothario,
She cannot pinch her painted foe
Nor pull her hateful golden hair;
Assault proceedings are de troy —
But what redress have ladies fair?
Envoy:
With a decree the weekly flow
Of wages vanishes in air;
The co.-re. buys a new trousseau—
But what redress have ladies fair?

“Lex”: The Premier was asked in the
Vic. Leg. Assembly last week whether the
Rev. Henry Worrall was to be prosecuted
for blasphemy for having said from the pul-
pjt: “God damn the man who wrote words
like that!” —the reference being to the poet-
farmer who was recently tarred and
feathered. Lawson said that no prosecution
for blasphemy would lie. But the reverend
gentleman’s Church could take action. In
the Anglican Church such cases are com-
paratively frequent. The Rev. William Rice,
rector of Sympson. Bucks, was fired out of
the fold for (1) “abusing the uses of the
pulpit” and (2) “bad language.” The firing
was done by virtue of the Benefices Act
(1898) ; Rice being found gpilty of having
broken his ordination, vows by cursing at
those whom he disapproved in church. All
Anglican clergymen promise inter alia to
“maintain quietness, peace and love”
amongst all men to the best of their ability.
The R.C. Church has a more summary
method of dealing with ordained blasphemers,
cursors and the like; they may be disci-
plined, inhibited or excommunicated without
even the form of trial. The Methodies and
Presbyterians get there just the same by
a slightly different route. They simply
declare that the offender is no longer a
Church member; and he is ipso facto dis-
qualified. Violent language is, of course, one
of the customs of the clerical trade in Aus-
tralia, and the Rev. Worrall’s spiritual
superiors would have to take that into con-
sideration if they decided to deal with his
case. It may be the divine’s first
lapse of the sort; and each saver of souls
is allowed his first bark, as it were.'
“Nivius”: The Lord keep me from judg-
ing Diggers! At one court-martial on which
I, an Australian, sat under an English pre-
sident, we were staggered when to tile pre-
sident’s usual question, “Do you object to
be tried by me as president, or by either of
the officers whose names you
have heard read?” the accused
listlessly replied, “No; get on
with the game, you old
bald-head !” On another occasion,
the reply to this very necessary
and polite question being in the
affirmative, upspake the court’s
majesty, “To whom, then, do
you object?” only to wilt under the compre-
hensive, “Why, to the whole blanky lot of
you !”

From Macquarie-street: —
There was a storm in our teacup when the pro-
fession in Sydney rolled up in "great numbers to dis-
cuss the fate of the Hun medical practitioners who
were interned during the war. It was argued that
these men, now that Peace had come, should not be
allowed to have the free run of Australia. No
Britisher even in pre-w-ar days was allowed to prac-
tise in Hunland unless he passed an examination,
and when he did so he was permitted to attend
British subjects only. Why should we, then, permit
these men to make a living out of Australian
patients? The thing was absurd!
One of the quartette had been allowed to practise
at the Internment Camp and had behaved scandal-
ously when the Lusitania was sunk. He had in pre-
war days obtained some notoriety as a specialist in
the surgery of deformities, and theatrical ladies
when they happened to get a broken ankle usually
called him in to get the bones wired. Ordinary-
splinting would have been just as efficacious, but fair
Thespians and others in the limelight like new kinds of
medical or surgical treatment that can be paragraphed.
THE TOY'S ONLY FAILING.
FRIEND: “ What ever is the matter with baby? I never saw
it cry so much before.”
NURSE: “Oh, its uncle sent it this toy which it can’t break.”
In the olden days people used to flock to a fashion-
able waterside suburb to have their backs ironed for
lumbago; and they couldn’t even pronounce the
doctor’s name. With the onset of the war came
the opportunity of all Australian surgeons who
obeyed the call to become adept in the orthopedic
art, and many of them had the privilege of working
under the vigilant eyes of Sir Robert Jones, the
greatest living orthopedic surgeon. Every medico
who went to the war is therefore more or less of a
specialist in the surgery of deformities, so there is
no longer any necessity for Hun aid in this line.
The meeting said so; and Deutschland was counted
out.
But, in law, Hera and the others can’t be shifted.
They are registered practitioners, and the Medical
Board has no power under the N. S. Wales Medical
Act to remove their names from its list. And of
course the National. Parliament is powerless. So
tlu-ee courses are open to the doctors. They can
get fresh legislation passed in N. S. Wales enabling
the Medical Board to take the names of these men
off the register; or get them deported; or boycott
them. For a start, the public will be asked to try
the boycott. It seems likely to be futile. In view
of the hundreds of fit young doctors who didn’t serve
abroad, or attempt to, and who are now hanging on
to the practices of men who did serve, and in some
cases even boycotting the latter —in view of these
circumstances it is unlikely that the public will
enter into the campaign with much spirit.
* * * *
“Fax”: Not as an ardent believer in medi-
cal science (having already suffered too much
from it) do I heartily endorse what the
N. S. Wales branch of the B.M.A. has said
HER HOBBY, IN FACT.
“Does your wife take to bridge?”
“Yes —every penny she has.”
on the question of alien doctors. The local
branch protested that “claims, understood
to have been made on behalf of interned
medical practitioners, that they possessed
certain special knowledge essential to the
well-being of the community, which would be
lost by their deportation, are not based on
any known facts. Any special knowledge or
expertness they may have is possessed per-
haps in greater degree by many practitioners
in different parts of the Commonwealth.” I
cry “Hear, hear” feelingly. It was my lot
last year to pay some guineas as a special
consultation fee to a German doctor who
had not been interned. He was named to
me as one specially qualified to deal with
my case, so 1 had him called in to consult
with the other doctor or two. And what did
this bristly-headed practitioner do? Brought
along the inevitable blood-testing machine,
which had previously been applied by other
doctors, and seemed hurt to discover that my
b.p. was normal; made a variation in a pre-
scription, which was such an unfortunate
alteration that it had to be discarded in a
hurry ; and cautioned me impressively against
swallowing mucus instead of expectorating it.
In the course of convalescence I went to
health resorts where other escaped sufferers
swapped reminiscences, and then I dis-
covered that various of them had also been
advised to call in one or other German
(hictor, and they also had learned nothing
from the pretentious persons—save that
mucus was something to be carefully ex-
pectorated, and such like! Then I began
to wonder how it came about that all of
us had consulted these pretenders. Evi-
dently their German connection explained
their flourishing practice. The Huns were
leagued together to barrack for their com-
patriots. They made the claim that these
men possessed certain special knowledge.
Their tongues had all been wagging praises
of the bristle-headed Germans because they
were. German, and we Australians had been
bluffed into supposing them something they
never were or will be.
“F.C.D.”: “Lex” (B. 11/12/T9) over-
looks the fact that jury-squaring is prac-
tised on both sides —on one side before the
jury list is compiled. After a recent import-
ant criminal case I met the senior-sergeant
and expressed surprise at the acquittal. The
sergeant became unfit for publication, but
I gathered that he had been “shown a point”
by the foreman of the jury. Said the Law
bitterly, “I met the cow about a fortnight
ago, and after we had a drink he introduced
the subject of this case and expressed his
holy horror at the behavior of the two pri-
soners. Said that if he had his way he
would hang them. Of course I thought he
was all right, so I got him shoved on the
jury, only to find when it was too late that
the —- had been sent to me after being
squared by the other side.” The fact that
he was able and willing to shove on the jury
a man whom he thought had pre-judged the
case and desired to see the prisoners' sum-
marily banged didn’t appear to strike the
officer as unfair or dishonest. It is to be
hoped,- therefore, that any amending law will
have a double edge.
“Barney” : For a time our “details” were
with the Tommies at Cleopatra Camp
(Alexandria), and it fell to the Aussies to
do a couple of guards a week. In order
to get a good turnout the O.C. hit on the
plan of warning one over the number re-
quired for duty and allowing the best-
dressed off. It worked all right with the
Tommies; but the Aussies, when detailed,
would “sell a horse,” and the winner was
given the shiniest bandolier, the brightest
mess-tin. etc., while a couple lent a hand
to give his overcoat a good roll. Thus when
the guard fell in, there was only one trier
for the Fashion Handicap.

“Rio”: I hope “No. 477” (B. 11/12/T9)
doesn’t interpret my remarks as meaning that
mounted troops can charge unbroken, well-
trained infantry with success even should
the latter be not entrenched. What I say
is that, given the conditions favorable to
mounted shock fiction, i.e., suitable ground
with the enemy below par for some reason —
say, scattered, fatigued, badly led or trained
—and the charge coming as a surprise, then
mounted rifles are as likely to be successful
as cavalry. In one of the South African
instances I mentioned the British column
had halted for the day on a selected position,
put out its pickets and sentries, and pro-
ceeded to make itself comfortable. About
an hour afterwards, when the British horses
Were off-saddled or at water, the foot-sloggers
bathing and shaving, and a pow-wow at the
lI.Q. tent absorbing the attention of the
officers, the Boers got to windward, fired
the long veldt grass, and came down unseen
behind the smoke, which they suddenly gal-
loped through, firing from the saddle. In
a few seconds they had the British guns and
were looting or stampeding the transport.
The mounted troops (raw Yeomanry) “re-
tired to reform,” and the gunners who
resisted were shot; but the Tommy ser-
geant-major gathered the infantry, fixed
bayonets and retook the guns before the
Dutchmen could get them away. The
burghers then vamoosed with what they could
carry. Surprise was everything in this case.
The maxim “When in doubt attack” seems
to apply particularly to small bodies of
mounted troops. A troop of British cavalry
about 20 strong suddenly charged a small
Boer position. The Tommies got home, only
one being killed —the young officer-in-com-
mand. He had over a dozen bullets in him.
Not another Briton was touched, every Boer
having apparently, in the stress of the
moment, aimed at the leader.

“Madge Hysteria”: Willie was absent
from school on the last three days of the
school week. An excuse form was despatched
to Willie’s dad, who signed and filled it in:
Was on account of Ilis Grandmother. She past
away Wedensday morning and was buerried on thurs-
day and was unable to attend on Friday.
Leave of absence granted and Willie’s excuse
framed and hung in the teachers’ office.

Rupert Desmond, woolclasser, usually of
Melbourne, has discovered a pleasant side-
line for gentlemen of advanced age. He
looks around for a willing widow or spin-
ster, not necessarily younger than himself,
marries her, and then leaves with as much
of her worldly possessions as he happens to
be carrying at the time. One of the tem-
porary comforts of Rupert’s declining years
took the precaution to divorce him in Mel-
bourne lasi; week, and her evidence showed
that she lived with him one night only.
Next day. when they were off for their
honeymoon, Rupert collected her bag con-
taining the £26 she had drawn from the
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY.
“Oh, I think I detest you — you're an abso-
lute rotter! Very few girls would
marry you.”
“Well, one will he enough for a start.”
bank, and vanished from her life. There
was she-waiting at the railway-station for
two hours, but never a note came from
Rupert stating that his other wives wouldn’t
let him. Melbourne police say they know of
at least five other wives, all of whom lost
their cash savings and honeymoon luggage
through Rupert’s carelessness; and they
think the five may be 50. And Rupe is no
chicken. He’s 63, and still going strong
for all that is known to the contrary. It
seems absurd to describe him as a wool-
classer. He’s a stale-tart swallower by
profession, and a classer of wool when he
wants a holiday.

“Fax”: The cable that a Turner painting
—“Walton Bridges”—had been bought for
the Melbourne Gallery by the administrators
of the Felton Bequest, was weighted with
the comment that “the picture was formerly
sold at Christie’s for about £5000.” What it
once fetched at Christie’s has nothing to do
with the case. A Kneller portrait was once
sold at Christie’s for something like £4OOO,
and then Kneller stock fell as low as two
figures in one case. Turner’s cracked and
faded paintings have declined in market value
for years past *> wherefore to talk of the one-
time price of “Walton Bridges” is absurd.
They might as well tell us what Landseers
used to fetch.

“London Daily Mail says that the Prince of
Wales is easily the most popular young man living.

“London Times hopes that Lady Astor will

And find, as reckoning comes, their pulse beat faster
Than ever Speakers did for Mrs. Astor.

FRITZ HART.
P. O. Fysh, who died last week, was the
last of the half-dozen or more picturesque
members of the Federal Convention which
began its sittings in Adelaide in 1597. His
fall figure, long white beard and minatory
forefinger were his chief assets. In Federal
politics he began as an honorary Minister and
dropped into the job of P.M.G. Once, when
the Speck’s Treasurer, Fysh was boasting to
an Age man that the income-tax of his State
was (say) £32,000; and he repeated the
syllables slowly to let them soak in. “Fine !”
said the pressman. “Nearly half as much
as David Syme’s income!”
The Sydney, from which Ross Smith was
sighted as he neared Port Darwin, was one
of the warships that escorted the troopship
which conveyed the young man to Egypt.
That was in 1914. Ross was then 22, and
as one of the rank and file of the 3rd Light
Horse saw the Sydney hurriedly steam off
on the journey which ended the Emden.
Joe Ward, one-time Premier of Maori-
land and a Minister in every Government
since IS9I except the one Tom Mackenzie
ran for a few months seven years ago, got
well beaten in his own electorate last week.
As a dealer in oats, owner of the largest
overdraft in the defunct Colonial Bank and
politician, Joe has had a picturesque career
since, at 24, he knocked off earning £2 10s.
a week as a telegraph operator. He is 03
now —a stout, garrulous little man with a
waxed moustache, a kindly heart, a
baronetcy, 147 neckties, a lot of money and
several grandchildren. His long suit was
raising a loan and being affable and riding
to glory on the broad shoulders of old Dick
Seddon. When Dick foundered, Ward
struck more trouble than he ever dreamed
about, and faced it like that sort of man
does all over the world —by shuffling and
wire-pulling and fusing.
Among the election casualties in Maori-
land none will be more mourned over than
that which befel Jimmy Carroll, licked for
the Gisborne seat by a loquacious lawyer-
pastoralist named Lysnar. The son of a
whaler, Jimmy is perhaps the only man in
the Windy Isles without a personal enemy.
He is also about the laziest, most casual
individual bn earth. No one ever saw him
in a hurry. No conceivable combination of
circumstances would disturb the serenity of
his mind —or make him leave the club while
there was anyone left to yarn to. Heaven
only knows how many cigars he has smoked
or how often he has seen the sun rise, but
none of these circumstances kept him from
being the finest public speaker in the
Dominion. A large share of the poetic
Maori imagination was passed over to little
James under the tree near Wairoa where a
Ngatika-hungunu mother gave him birth 62
years ago. He had been a member of the
House of Reps, every day since 1887.
Stewart Dawson last week paid £lOO,OOO
for the George-street end of the Strand
Arcade, Sydney—the part that has been for
years in the Jobbins family Some day that
man ought to supply somebody with materials
for a faithful story of his business life. He
had about three-ha’pence when he was 10,
and he’d earned that himself. Scotch, of
course, he started in business at Liverpool,
and that was his headquarters for many
years. From there he pushed to Auckland
and Sydney, and from Sydney to Melbourne
occupying an office about 6 x 8 up a long
flight of stairs in Collins-street. In those
days it was all advertising and postal busi-
ness until there was a cautious move into
Swanston-street: “not too far from the cor-
ner; I may want that, too, some day.” He
did, and got it. It was the same with the
Sydney business. And, long ago, of course,
the English business outgrew Liverpool, and
the sign was set up in Regent-street and a
score of other places. Though still vigorous,
Stewart Dawson has an idea that he ought
to start preparing for the comfort of his old
age (he can’t be much more than 70
yet), and, after much wandering, he fixed
upon Sydney to do it in.
According to a cabled report from Wash-
ington (U.S.A.). “President Wilson’s atti-
tude has revived doubts as to his mental
condition.” France, England, Spain, some
of the German kingdoms, and many of the
little European principalities have had rulers
whose minds were affected. But if Wilson’s
intellect goes he will figure as the first mad
President. Less desirable, as a record, than
the headship of the world’s first League of
Nations, Still a record.
The will of Mrs. E. M. Hordern has been
proved in Sydney for probate purposes at
£83,233. This lady was the widow of An-
thony Hordern the Younger—he who entered
into a big contract with the Westralian Gov-
ernment for building a railway on land-
grant terms, but died before the work was
completed. At one time he was in partner-
ship with his late brother Sam.
John T. Arundel, a man who had a big
share in developing the Pacific Islands, died
last month at Bournemouth (Eng.). After
spending the best part of his manhood hunt-
ing the almost-sterile, treeless Oceanic dots
for guano, Arundel worked numerous Cen-
tral Pacific specks and also some islands on
the North Queensland coast. While the
Pacific Islands Co. was failing to “make a
do” of the equatorial Baker Island, Albert
F. Ellis, a member of the co.’s staff, dis-
covered, through the historic “fossilised
wood” doorchock in the Sydney office, the
huge Nauru and Ocean Island deposits—the
purest known phosphate deposits in the world.
The modest plant, transhipped from Baker
Island, inaugurated the great workings on
Ocean Island. During Arundel’s tune as
head of the Pacific Phosphate Co. (floated in
London to work the vast deposits) the good
comradeship which had kept together the
little staff on the distant mid-Pacific dots
suffered in the larger interests involved; but
both islands were nevertheless made pleasant
places for the white staff, and these condi-
tions were maintained until the retirement
of the old boss and the introduction of un-
adulterated commercialism to the Island-
management.
The knowledge of more things than were
ever on the Admiralty charts passed out the
other day when Captain Andrew Sinclair
went aloft at Thursday Island. For 40 years
he had been poking about Torres Strait and
its islands, and what the fine old navigator
didn’t know re diving and pearls it wasn’t
much use asking the next man about.
In order to distinguish herself, the daughter
of Charles John Fairfax, a former part-
proprietor of S. M. Herald, has, in proper
legal fashion, lengthened her name by a rod
or perch, and is in future to be Charles-Fair-
fax. Miss Charles-Fairfax spent a good
deal of her life in England, but has returned
by the Orvieto. Her father, the eldest son
of John Fairfax, served an apprenticeship
in the Herald office, and became a partner
when Charles Kemp sold out. In 1563 he
returned to Sydney after a tour of Europe
and America,,and in December of that year
was thr wn from his horse, surviving the
accident only a few hours. He was then 35.
Died lately in London. Mark Reuben,
pearl-dealer, squatter, money-spinner. A
London Jew, he came to Australia many
years ago, and interested himself it) the
pearling industry in the Nor’-West. He had
phenomenal luck, made heaps of money and
spent it lavishly. Broome residents still talk
of a banquet he gave on board the Paroo
in 1905. Each guest, somewhat to his em-
barrassment, was handed a nosegay of rare
orchids, which had been conveyed to Broome
encased in ice. That was the sort of thing
he did. It was always a mystery to his
friends that he wasn’t knocked on the head,
for he generally carried pearls of enormous
value, and exhibited them wherever he went.
“Lou”: I first met John Benjamin King,
one of the 12 Sydney I.W.W. prisoners,
in Calgary, British Columbia, locomo-
tive-engine driving on the Canadian-Pacific.
He is about 49 now, and the last
20 he has given to the revolutionary
movement. A self-educated man, he has
a lot of personality
and a very convincing
platform style, and he
gave the Sydney
I.W.W. perhaps its
biggest lift when he
joined it. The most
forceful exponent of
Marxian economics in
Aussie, he debited
effectively in Syd-
ney one night with
Prof. Meredith At-
kinson. He has a
cheerful disposition
and might have been
a successful politician.
Wonder what his poli-
tics will be when he
comes out at well over
50?

“Where the Pelican Builds Her Nest” is
best known. Foott joined the permanent
forces soon after leaving Brisbane Grammar,
transferring later to the Commonwealth and
specialising on the engineering side. Going
over in 1014. he was chief engineer for the
Australian Army Corps at the finish. The
pink ribbon of the White Eagle of Servia,
which he wears, is a comparatively rare
one among Australians, and was given
mostly for work on Gallipoli.
“Henry Horsecollar” on some history:—
Sydney Telegraph, as a matter of course, dug
up the Captain Cook legend in its issue of October
13 apropos of birdman Ross Smith’s dropping out
of the sky into Darwin; also the Age dropped into
poetry. In the Telegraph’s picture the old skipper,
dressed in Georgian clo., stood by a statue where-
on he was described as the original white-man dis-
coverer of the N. Territory in 1770, and invited
Ross Smith to share the pedestal. The bit of Aus-
tralia about Darwin was among the first finds that
white men are supposed to have made in these parts,
and old Portuguese maps allege that it belonged to
Portugal and was a suburb of Timor and Banda soon
after 1542, in the spacious days when Magellan came
round this way, and when the Spaniards were set-
ting up the first American printing press in Mexico,
and Leonardo da Vinci had just died after painting
the “Last Supper” and inventing the wheelbarrow.
Later the place was a sort of back yard to the Dutch
property in Java and a fairly well-known part of
the vast colony of New Holland. Cook's connection
with the Territory in 1770 or any other time is
shadowy. Yet he drifted that way, through Torres
Strait (named by the Spaniard Torres 164 years
THE PRINCE OF SMILES , BETTER
KNOWN AMONG DIGGERS AS
“TEDDY WOODBINE.”
earlier), past the Gulf of Carpentaria (found and
named by the Franco-Dutehman Carpentier about
1G24), past the eastern region of the Territory
(named Arnheim Land after a Dutchman) and other
places. If he got into Darwin his route probably
led through Van Diemen Gulf, where the same busy
buzzing Mynheer who found Tasmania and Maori-
land had left his visiting-card 128 years before
Cook. In Cook’s day the sailing directions around
North Australia were simple. You followed the
smell of schnapps by night, and by day you fol-
lowed the track marked by fragments of Dutch
cheese, herring-bone and other cabin debris. But
from Tasmania to Townsville the coast was mostly
conjecture except in a large, vague way.
Cook the navigator is rather a legend, like William
Tell and Job’s three comforters. He wasn’t the
first or the hundredth man to voyage round the
world nor the first Englishman to do so. He was
probably the thousandth or several thousandth white
man in Australia, and even Englishmen were here
before him. He didn't find Sydney, though he passed
by it, and he didn’t invent the name of Australia.
He didn’t even come out to visit this country in
particular, but to carry Joe Banks, who didn’t want
to hunt the kangaroo and develop the great natural
resources so much as to find a quiet spot with a
view of the transit of Venus. Cook and Batiks
between them hoisted the British flag. Every im-
portant flag on earth has been hoisted in all manner
of places without anything happening; but this
hoisting led to something. Also they found Botany
Bay and invented the awful name “New South
Wales.”'
The fact is that Britain has been lamentably and
pitiably short of first discoverers. Leaving out
ancient finders like Greeks and Egyptians, the Norse-
men, Spaniards, Portuguese and Dutch found pr-w-
tically everything-—the Spaniards and Portuguese
especially—and the Englishman was left. So Bull's
nation and the Australian end of it especially tried
to make a first discoverer out of Cook. Australia
took him as a sort of date or ancestor or landmark
as Rome did with Romulus and England with
Hengist and Horsa, and Scandinavia with Odin, and
the Greeks with Jupiter. He is a semi-myth and
patron saint.
Now both England and Australia can start afresh
with authentic discoverers and original pioneers bv
air—England with Bleriot and Australia with Ross
Smith. There are now, apparently, only three more
first-discoverers to come-—the first man who arrives
under water; the first man w'ho drops from the
stars; and the first man who leaps up out of the
hole bored through the globe from Europe. The
first artificial man made in the country won’t
count, he being a prc#luet rather than an argonaut.
“Adelaide”: A man with a long memory or
an indexed file corrects the suggestion that
present mayor Frank Moulden is the first
lawyer to sit in that chair. The very first
mayor. Hurtle Fisher, was a lawyer. So was
the second, Wilson. By the way, a muni-
cipal corporation is one of the various things
which Adelaide had before any other Aus-
tralian city.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The candidates’ clamor has ended,
Now hushed is the multitude’s roar;
Two mummers on whom I depended
Will strut in the limelight no more.
Small int’rest have I in the tally
Of seats from the Fusion won back —
For Denison’s dealt with O’Malley,
And Webster has “gone to the pack.”
I’d care not though parties had perished,
Since parties at best are a curse;
But We'.ster for long have I cherished,
His exploits enshrining in verse ;
Much coin has he brought to my coffers,
But wit has dried up at its fount —
No profit O’Malley now offers,
And Web. he has “taken the count.”
Salt tears with my jnk now I mingle ;
The Bald-headed Eagle essayed
To assist weary writers of jingle,
But goes back again to the shade.
If Gwydir had Webster elected
My harp would have thrilled once again—
A King has been basely rejected,
A Poet most heartlessly slain !

*O. Blin”: The late Alfred Deakin was
the most voracious reader I ever met. No-
thing was too trivial for his inspection.
Obscure newspapers, dodgers, etc., were
scanned with the same avidity as a favorite
author. Deakin never went away for a
spell without enough books to start a Uni-
versity. His annual tetreats in the scrub
near Port Phillip Heads were long explora-
tions in biography, political economy, philo-
sophy, or some new “ism” that was tickling
the public fancy. When Fletcherism first
invaded Australia from America, Alfred was
one of the first to become fascinated by the
new religion, and yarns were told about him
and son-in-law Brookes indulging in masti-
cation combats at the dinner-table.
“Exile”: Four shipping men control the
British mercantile marine—lnchcape, Pirrie,
Furness and Owen Phillips ; and the greatest
of these is Inchcape, chairman of P. and 0.,
British India, N.Z. Shipping Cos. and Union
of N.Z. He is small, agile, genial, with
a bright red.moustache, uses strong perfumes,
and was Sir James Mackay before he was a
lord. Formerly a shipping clerk, like the
late Alfred Jones, who built up British
shipping interests in West Africa, Mackay
made the British India Cos. successful, and
when old Tommy Sutherland (also about sft.
Sin. tall) died, Inchcape became chairman of
the P. and O. He has extended the Shipping
King and interlocked all the chief steamship
lines through their directors. He bought
the Union S.S. Cos. cheap, and in Maoriland
the prophets say he will acquire the Huddart.

“Centurion”: Australian-born Brig.-Gen.
Fitzgerald, whose divorce from the Dowager-
Duchess of Sutherland was lately para-
graphed, was for some time inspectiug-oiricer
at the Cavalry School at Zeitoun, near Cairo.
Australian officers going through a course
there found him swankier than any Briton.
He was one of a set of younger generals who
wore their Sam Brownes without the
shoulder-strap, a breach of dress regs. in-
dulged in by Douglas Haig and imitated
by those of his admirers whose rank put
them out of reach of the A.P.M. One hot
morning in the desert outside Heliopolis,
Fitz. and a couple of instructors were going
through reports written on the previous
day’s work by Light Horse officers. When
he came to the report of Major Blankelly-
Blanke he had to consult with his offsiders
—a Guards colonel and a Lancer captain.
With a superiah and pained expression the
trio turned to the Major. “Majali Blanke.'
said Fitz., “if y’ll excuse my sayin’ so, y’r
writin’ is most illegible.” “Yas,” chipped
in the Guardsman, “an’ you Owstralians
usually write such rippin’ good hands.”
Blanke was very fed up. “I hadn’t the
advantages of most of my compatriots,” he
said bitterly. “My education has been
grossly neglected. In my youth I was, like
yourselves, sent to an English public school.”
“Camelero” : Many of my cobbers are sleep-
ing far from the beaten track in Egypt and
Sinai. The little
graveyard at Mersa
Matruli, N.W.
Egypt, holds the
remains of a soli-
tary Billjim, but
several Imperial
men keep him com-
pany. In the heart
of the Baheria
oasis, a stronghold
of the Senussi, a
lonely member of
the 13th Camel
Corps is buried.
And at El Magnra,
which is so desolate
a stretch of country
that even a jackal
can’t exist there, the
desert winds blow
over the grave of a
Camelier an d a
Light Horseman.
ALEXANDER
HEAN, M.H.A.,
Tus, Minister for
Repatriation.
Melbourne eye-doctor Barrett, who is pro-
minent in advocating proportional represen-
tation, is dreadfully prosy at times. One
night he delivered a lecture on something or
other in the Vic. western district. Next day
he visited a State school where the teacher
was giving a lesson on “The Village Black-
smith.” It came to “something attempted,
something done,” and the kiddies were asked
what they had done the day before “to earn
a night’s repose.” “I went to Dr. Barrett’s
lecture,” said the first kid. The teacher
passed to the next line in a hurry.
The parson’s son is getting a mortgage on
the Rhodes scholarship. Of the latest Aus-
tralian half-dozen three are “sons of the
manse” and the fourth is a grandson.
“Friday Island”: I enter for the lonely-
man competition one Harry, a Dane, aged 70,
caretaker on an unworked cocoanut planta-
tion at Deliverance Island, off the south coast
of New Guinea, umpteen miles out of the
track of deep-sea ships and Torres Strait
pearling luggers. Until our arrival he had
not seen a white man for two years nor a
colored man for one year. A\ orse still, he
had not had a smoke for five months. His
companions are three dogs and innumerable
fowls running wild. In return for tobacco he
helped to load the boat with cliooks.
Stephen Sherry farewells a bushranger:
“Death: Charters, May 22, at Grenfell (N.S.W.),
Daniel Charters, aged 88. R.1.P." I mentioned in
Grenfell that I had come to the district to get some
reliable data and local color for a bushranging story.
That was in 1910. “Old Dan Charters is your bird,”
they said. “Get Dan to talk.” According to the
local greybeards Dan’s rifle had done deadly work
that tragic night at Eugowra Docks. lie was
credited with three gold-escort troopers —all shot
through the heart. His precision earned for him
the soubriquet of “Dead-shot Dan.” Grenfell bestowed
the title with pride. The owner subsequently got
a bare decision over the hangman by giving Queen's
evidence. I found my quarry, sphinxlike, on a Stump.
“They say you are the oldest resident, Mr. Char-
ters. You must have witnessed some remark-
able occurrences about here in your time.” Dan
answered drowsily. “Yairs, I’ve seen them green
flats covered with goats.” At last I got him
to talk of the roaring days on Lambing Flat. Yairs.
he’d seen the riots when the diggers on Tipperary
Gully clubbed 200 Chinese to death in one day an l
threw the bodies down abandoned shafts. Then I
asked him point-blank if he had known O’Meally or
Gilbert. Dan looked puzzled. “Once knew a Miss
O’Meally, but she’s dead.” And I don’t know to
this day whether it was Dan Charters who pulled
my leg or the local inhabitants who had pulled
their own. But I suspect that it was Dan.

Major McNamee, of Roma (Q-), who re-
ceived the other day the U.S.A. Distin-
guished Service Medal, was in the British
Field Artillery when lie was detailed to in-
struct Uncle Sam’s boys. He was with
them during the Argonne-Meuse drive. This
is the second doughboy distinction awarded
the Bananalander. He previously had the
Distinguished Service Cross; and he also
holds the British Military Cross.

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Apropos Jus-
tice Fellows ( ti. 13/11/’l9). When, under
pressure, he accepted a seat on the bench
the Victorian Bar gave
him a dinner at Scott’s.
Chief Justice Stawell
and other Judges were
guests also. The Chief,
in supporting the main
toast, mentioned that
Fellows had, on his
arrival, asked for a
job as a police magis-
trate. The new Judge
went one better. He
said that, on arrival,
not being able to
get in with th e
attorneys, h e ha d
applied for admission
to the Mounted Police,
but the Chief Commis-
sioner had rejected
him as being too un-
gainly for a horseman,
and the foot police
was not to be thought
of, much more desir-
able members of. the
Irish Constabulary be-
ing under offer to the
number of 50 or GO.
HIS EX. GALWAY,
of South Australia.
Dr. Griffith Taylor, the brilliant Sydney
graduate who was senior geologist to Capt.
Scott’s Antarctic expedition, had his 39th
birthday on December 1. He took degrees,
in science, engineering and arts, the prize
medal of Sydney Uni. for his D.Sc. thesis
in 1915. and he is the author of numerous
books on Australian climate, met urology,
gettsrrnphy and physiography. lie married,
in 1914, Doris Priestley, a descendant of
the discoverer of oxygen.
“Baba”: Staughton belonged to the old
school of Papuan official of Macgregor’s day,
and his pet aversion was pidgin English. He
had not bothered to learn a native language,
so had perforce to address his nigs in best
Dublin English. I was present one day when
he instructed his black sergeant, thus: “My
boy, I want you to proceed forthwith to
N— —, and there arrest the accessories, as
well as the principals, in the murder of one
Biama.” “Yes, sir,” replied the sergeant,
who saluted and retired. When Staughton
left the office, the sergeant came to me and
said.. “Master, what eld man he talk? lie
want me go buy sago?”
“HOWJA DO?”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We fit there at Gallipoli
When louil the un-graved Johnnos cried ;
We parched together, him and me,
And once together close-up died,
When all earth heaved up like a wave
And swamped us in a common grave.
We faced hell gaily, side by side,
On many bloody fields in France,
And when they bust me, two hands wide,
’Twas him who helped me through the dance.
We two have slep’ in one poor bag,
And shared a solitary fag.
We lived together in the mud,
Much more than brothers, me ana Jim;
We dossed together in the flood,
And, ’stfuth, 1 would have died for him,
Which ain’t no gaudy wonder, see,
Coz Jimmie would have died for me.
An’ we was mates in London town ;
We hit it up there good and fine;
My oof was Jimmie’s to a brown,
And half his drink was alwiz mine.
To-day on Collins-street we two
Went by, and sez he; “Howja do?”
We cuddled down like kids at night
Where livin’ fire around us swirled.
If I had lost him —Gawd, it’s right,
I would have faced an empty world !
We passed to-day in civvies new ;
Sez I to Jimmie: “Howja do?”

To derive the greatest amount of nutriment from their food,
ail animals need the digestive stimulus of such clean whole-
some salt as is contained in “Leslie” Salt Licks.
Pure sea-salt, sterilised and dried in the sunshine at Port
Augusta, S.A. is the basis of “Leslie” Salt Licks. To this are
added medicinal ingredients of known health value—and
the whole solidified into 5-lb. weather resisting blocks by
hydraulic pressure.
“Leslie” Salt Licks improve condition and weight and greatly
increase the milk and cream yield.
Insist an “Leslie” the original Salt Licks.

Our Cat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Dr. John L. Cope is arranging an Antarctic ex-
pedition to leave England in June, 1920. The chief
objects of the expedition are to ascertain the position
and extent of the mineralogical and other economi-
cally valuable deposits known to exist with a view
to their development as a source of Imperial wealth.”
Anta retie continent is, on appear-
ances, the one superlative wild cat
left on the earth’s surface, a
cat being defined as a plausible, sale-
able, floatable mineral proposition. It
is assumed, by right of much exploration and
much raising of the flag, to be a British
Empire cat. By virtue of proximity, of a
certain amount of exploration and of our
membership in the empire, a very great part
of it—perhaps the greatest part —should be
Our Cat. It is up to Australian enterprise
to do something with Our Cat, and do it
before we are forestalled and all the good
claims pegged out.
The Antarctic continent is known to be
enormous. It has many things that Australia
lacks —a cool climate (if that is an advan-
tage), abundance of moisture, mountains
which we want badly, and, it is believed,
enormous deposits of coal. Even in the
small areas where the ice and snow have
been scraped away the material for coal
prospectuses has been found. Also there
are more than suspicions about gold and iron.
The geographical position isn’t hopeless, for
in Norway and Russia cities (of a sort) exist
closer to the Pole than the nearer parts of
Antarctica, and Norway maintains a popula-
tion of eight per square mile in iia Polar
Circle province of Tromsoe.
The obvious point is that Our Cat requires
its superincumbent layer of ice removed so
that operations may commence on a large
scale. In Alaska a hurried population
started to dig out 836,0000 z. of gold per year
without any scientific clearing of the country,
but possibly Alaska isn’t fitted for scientific
clearing. The reasonable idea is to use
Perpetual Motion. That valuable substance
can be manufactured in unlimited quantities
in Our Cat, or, rather, once started, it.will
manufacture itself. Even the ice accumula-
tion of 50 million years will start to remove
itself if melted or partly melted and given
a downhill track to travel on. The pace
is often tremendous. Antarctica seems to be
mostly downhill, with the Pole near the apex,
and on land ; whereas the North role, accord-
ing to accomplished liars and others, js water,
and naturally on sea level. Coming down-
hill dissolved ice provides power in boundless
quantities for any sort of purpose. I once,
on a bright, early November day, stopped at
a turn of the track leading to Milford Sound
(Maoriland), and counted 14 superb water-
falls. They were temporary affairs, fed by
one winter’s snows on a comparatively small
group of mountains. They flowed chiefly
from sunrise to sunset, and froze up at night
because they were driven by the sun, not by
Perpetual Motion. Yet they offered enough
power to drive all the machinery on the
island ; and all its argument could have been
heated with the surplus.
The waterfalls coming downhill without
being pushed will work electrical machinery,
which will send heat and power uphill with-
out being pushed either. Networks of wires,
spread over the country, will cut the ancienr
glaciers to pieces and saw through them, and
melt them, and tumble them downhill, and
as they go down they will make new force,
and a new force will go up to extend the
work. Of course, as new waterfalls develop
further inland through the ice frontage being
cut away, they will have to be harnessed
with new machinery, but as soon as the iron-
mines are opened the power will make the
new machinery for its own vast extension.
Falling water is force—vast, cheap and
(with luck) perpetual—and so long as science
endures and improves, a country with an
almost unlimited supply of potential water
and a mighty lot of fall has possibilities.
The overburden will grow again, but it
won’t grow so fast as to be unmanageable.
It won’t grow so fast as a tropical forest,
and people contrive to keep that removed
when there is sufficient inducement. Besides,
a regular crop of new glaciers will be
wanted on the highlands to feed the
machinery. A year when the glaciers didn’t
grow to keep the heating apparatus going
would be a bad drought year in Antarctica.
No matter how vast the coal deposits and the
coal exports it must be essentially a country
that burns ice, and when the clearing pro-
cess has gone far enough the reckless hewing
down of glaciers or ringbarking of ava-
lanches will be discouraged.
At first, with inexperienced workers start-
ing the first continental ice-clearance in
history, and with great decayed accumula-
tions to shift, many icebergs will doubtless
escape to sea and possibly even block the
entrance to Hobart, but this will be a pass-
ing inconvenience. All forms of force, in-
cluding locomotives and mules, bolt at times.
It isn’t likely that the raising of the sea-
level with melted ice would flood any Aus-
tralian coastal city, nor that the unballasting
of one end of the earth would make the globe
turn over suddenly. Life in the new country
must needs be precarious and eternal vigil-
ance (with the apparatus) will be the price
of life. But eternal vigilance with the pump
is the price of life in Holland, yet Holland
survives. In Australia the struggle with
the rabbit is eternal, and if the stove was
neglected for a day in Sheol all theology
might perish on the spot. What effect, if
any, the proceedings would have on the
climate of Australia is unknown; but if
they did anything to the climate round
Eucla or Lake Eyre it would probably be
an improvement.
Alaska, which is partly within the Arctic
Circle, was recently reported to have about
250 farms in working order without any
heating apparatus, and the reindeer had been
acclimatised; also the railway. But I regaid
Our Cat as essentially a mining proposition
and a source of power. Whether it will
ever be feasible to cable power from its
shores to Melbourne is a matter for scientific
research.

They rise superior to the
worst natural conditions
EVEN where conditions are so adverse
that they appear practically insuperable,
it will be found that Nature, by special-
isation, has produced the equipment to meet
them. For journeying over the shifting sands
of the stone-strewn desert she evolved the
camel’s foot.
No matter how exigent the need; no matter how great
the niceness of application; no matter how broad or
how minute must be the accommodation of this relief
to that embarrassment, Nature provides the means of
performing perfectly every function, however arduous.
Learning from Nature’s luminous page, and using the
best of her bountiful products, the Goodyear experts have
produced in Goodyear Tyres equipment which parallels
the wonderful attributes that enable the children of
Nature to overcome the worst of physical conditions.
Whether it be amid treacherous desert sands; whether it be in
opposition to the razor edges of sun baked or frost-bound ruts,
Goodyear Tyres endure with the obstinate efficiency of the highly
evolved foot or hoof of the beast of burden.
To severe natural conditions, or to the worst of artificial roadways’
Goodyear Tyres oppose a stubborn resistance. It is only by
maltreatment arising from human neglect or ignorance that their
wonderful endurance can be prematurely impaired.
“Every Goodyear Tyre is Goodyear-grade an
exacting standard that only the best can reach.
Goodyear Self-Cure
Tube Patches.
AMONG the finest aids that Goodyear
supplies for secure and economical
motoring are Goodyear Self-Cure
Tube Patches. These are handy, die-
cut patches—pure rubber discs that
stretch evenly with the tube. They will
not pull loose at the edges. Cementless,
easy to apply, they are invaluable in the
emergency. Packed twelve in a box,
they cost only a few pence. Always
keep a box handy.

Again The Bulletin turns to this co.’s
accounts to illustrate how slightly war con-
ditions affected the sale of goods which
could not be regarded as other than luxuries
that a war-stricken people could well do
without. The explanation of why Nicholson
and Cos. have been able to go on selling
pianos and other musical goods so easily
has been that while the war was being
1 ought no serious attempt was made, nor
has any been made since, to pay anything
like a reasonable proportion of its cost. The
< ’ommonwealth Government, rather than
risk the loss of votes by levying heavy taxes,
adopted the simple device of working on
lOU’s. Thus sane finance was again sacri-
ficed on the altar of party politics. A big
proportion of the loans raised has been spent
within the Commonwealth, and since the
public has also not realised the difference
between the sovereign and the paper which
has taken its place, and. further, does not
understand that the £23,882,814 of notes
issued in excess of the extra gold-holding
since October, 1914, represents so much
money set loose which has not been earned
hut is merely an inflation due to the stretch-
lng of the national credit, it has thought
itself better off than it used to be when it
had thousands more men creating instead
ot destroying wealth. So. though we have
paiticipated in a war which is estimated to
cost the Commonwealth almost 379 millions
by June y>o next, we have been spending
at something in excess even of the old rate
Despite shipping difficulties and high prices
we have imported musical instruments at
£513.240: 1915. £275.348;
1916, £329.614; 1917. £362 731- 191 S
£388,318 ; 1919.’ £384,855. Meantime the
value o f local manufactures has increased.
Nicholson s gross profits for the years ended
September o 0 have been as follows:
“ £ ?1> 421 I 1917 .. £60,917
1915 . . .j 0,138 I 1918 . . 68,815
1916 . . 52,982 I 1919 . . 75,674
Towards the end of the war the co. thus
fid a larger business than ever, and as the
dangers of the artificial prosperity have not
yet been exposed to the multitude, selling
conditions still continue favorable.
Twelve months ago this co. held very
heavy —they had a book value of
£ 105,579; however, unloading has been so
easy that at the latest balance the item had
been reduced to £67.561. Meantime amounts
duo under hire agreements have increased
from £130,420 to £167,043. which is almost
£27,000 in excess of the paid capital. These
long-distance accounts are very profitable;
but if dull times set in there are dangers in
a big t.-p. business of this class. Should
the prevailing artificial prosperity suddenly
collapse Nicholson and Cos. might easily have
thrown back on its hands a lot of second-
hand goods for which there would be no
market. From the point of view of the in-
vestor this is one weakness; and the fact
that the co. confines itself practically to
the sale of luxuries is another. Alto-
gether there are assets totalling £289,734,
™a«« up of hire-agreements, £167.043; stock,
fWjSGi; premises, £33,340; plant, etc.,
±6830; and War Loan, cash, trade debts and
odds and ends, £14,660. But on the other
side there are large creditors —liabilities
amount to no less than £91,097, making the
net assets £198,637. Buyers in the market
are offering 235. Gd. —for assets with a book
value of 28s. 4d. What these assets would
be worth should a period of depression set
in is another matter, and if any provision
has been made for contingencies it is not vis-
ible from the accounts. On the other hand
the margin of .profit in excess of the 10 p.c.
.. las been large—£4l,9Bß has been
distributed during the past three years, but
only ±6o_l has been added to visible reserves.

Reserves are now not far short of double the
paid capital, so the 25 p.c. div. means about
9 p.c. on shareholders’ money actually in the
business. And whereas on paid capital the
past year s net profit was equal to nearly
4o p.c., on total funds it represented under
P ,c - Apparently the co. transacts very
tittle except agency business, and does not
touch pastoral finance, though its book debts
have been exceptionally heavy during the
past tew years, due no doubt to the manage-
ment having had to carry its share of financ-
cups under the Imperial purchase scheme.
At Bopt. 30 it owed altogether £47,758. not
tar short of twice the amount of total funds.
rr?? Inn ot £S r side thcre were book debts
of £01,466. The rest of the assets com-
prised premises and property, £10,000; sale-
yards and plant, etc.. £3632; and stocks of
merchandise, etc.. £9574. The higher prices
received for wool have, of course, built up
commission earnings during recent years, but
expenses have also been mounting rapidly,
as this comparison shows: —
1915. 1917. 1918. 1919.
Commissions ..£10,610 £12,657 £15,278 £15,719
Expenses .. 7,719 9,070 11,661 11,912
The outlay to get in the Nor’-West Coast
business during the past year was parti-
cularly solid, but the directors report that
they have hastened to apply the brake, and
that unduly heavy expenses are not likely to
recur there % For the old shareholding client
the Tas. Woolgrowers’ Cos. has apparently
proved a highly profitable agency through
which to put his business.
After 12 years of fine achievement Great
Britain, Emmaville (N.S.W.), finds itself in
trouble. The Britain Main lead has cut out
and- the plant has been moved to the Back
lead, wffiere some good but difficult ground
awaits the nozzle. But costs threaten to be
so high that there is doubt wdiether work
will be profitable. The grade of ground on
the Y Creek ground is not so good, and it
would not take much to make further opera-
tions on that lease unpayable. For nearlv
three months of the half-year to October the
Y Creek plant was held up for want of
water. Results for the past year have been
as follows:
Britain plant. Y Creek plant.
April, Oct., April, Oct.,
. , 1919. 1919. 1919. 1919.
Sluiced (c. yds.).. 39,317 32,777 58,169 35,875
Tin (tons) .. 36$ 35$ 24$ 14
Yield (lb. per c. yd.) 2.06 2.41 .94 - .87
So only 49$ tons tin were recovered during
the latest run compared with 60f tons for
the previous half, and though the market
price had advanced an average of £27 per
ton, only £497 of profit was netted compared
with £798 in the earlier term. However,
with the balance brought in the directors had
£1032 to play with, and two Is. divs. were
handed out, leaving only £32 in the I’. & L.
account. What a record the co. has had!
In 32 years it has passed out £4 per share
on the 10,000 shares paid to 10s. each and
has meantime accumulated a reserve equal
to paid capital invested in liquid assets,
mostly War Loan.
Cobar Gladstone continues to be one of
the jokes of the Cobar field, trying to do
something desperate with a rattletrap plant
and defective shaft. When the pumps,
boilers, shaft, etc., permit, some fairly good
ore is sent to the C.S.A. smelters, but it
appears to be absolutely useless for the co.
to carry on under present conditions; money
must be had from somewhere to sink the
shaft and handle the water. Anew co. may
possibly be formed by and bye, which will
also take over the Young Australia mine.
Cobar Gladstone was formed in 1908, and
ever since its likely little show has been
at the mercy of boomsters, and has not had
a chance.
The Feldworth silver lode was the first
to be worked on the Yerranderie field
.W.)- _lt produced some phenomen-
ally-rich oxidised ore, but the sulphide zone
has never had a fair test. After being in
the hands of many syndicates it is now run
by the Dunne Cos., which was floated by
“Sulphide” Brown. If it cannot be made
to pay with silver and lead at present prices,
it ought to be buried for good. Whether
or not it can pay depends a lot on the terms
the co. can make with the corporation
which is the only purchaser of the ore.

At one time the New Dempsey, under
Nolan, was the pride of Gaffney’s Creek
(Vic.), but the shoot cut out and yields
went tp the pack. Still the revival of the
A 1 close-by and Celtic determination have
kept the Dempsey flag fluttering. Anew tun-
nel has gone in 700 ft. on the course of the
dyke, and the last 200 ft. have carried just
enough gold to raise hopes. The co. has
risen 114 ft. on fhe formation, and a winze
has been sunk 50ft. Overhead colors still
show, so more prospecting is on the pro-
gramme; but as the best gold is underfoot
in the winze, the hunt ought to be pushed
ahead there, too.
Associated Gold Mines, Ltd., has held its
annual meeting in London. But beyond the
announcement that the co.’s now broken-
down mine at Kalgoorlie had produced over
four millions’ worth of gold, nothing very
cheerful was told. Chairman Hooper said
that the manager was doing his best to
make ends’ meet. The Board has had its
eye on Hampton Plains, but so far it had
not deemed it Avortli Avliile to spend any
money in that direction. As for the co.’s
Canadian interests, the conditions of labor
and the cost of supplies had improved some-
what during the past year, but not suf-
ficiently to warrant recommencement of
operations.
* * * *
After lying low for some time, Westralian
Mines Development, Ltd., which claims to
have gold-mining interests at Yalgoo and
lead-mines at Northampton (W.A.), held a
meeting in London last month. Something
Avas said by the chairman about “the ener-
gies of the Board being directed in the early
future to a policy of systematic develop'-
ment and exploitation,” but little informa-
tion was given regarding the value of the
co.’s holdings. Like The Bulletin, he
probably thought that the less said about
them the better.
* * * *
The water shortage was not so acute at
New Ruby Flat, Branxholm (Tas.), during
the six months to Noy. 30, so manager J.
Holmes, who took over the show when John
Anton went w f est in August, was able to
show slightly better results: £2315 of tin
was sold compared with £1507 for the May
half. Even then a poor little profit of £O3B
was the best that could be shown, and that
does not go far on a paid capital of £24,370.
However, as there Avas no div. in the pre-
vious half, the term closed Avith a cash bal-
ance of £896, which has since grown as a
result of further realisations. So share-
holders get a ninepenny (£968), equal to
31 p.c. for the year. The balance-sheet does
not wear a very healthy appearance after
144 years, for the Avhole of the paid capital
and £SBO besides is represented by the mine
and plant, and there are no outside assets
to help a refund of capital when the show
peters out.

“C. Coral”: On the nor’-west side of
Darnlev Island there is a big stone representing a
woman. This is supposed to be the evening star,
called by the natives Ilwel. At sundown, when
the star itself begins to glow faintly, boys and men
are allowed to take small stones and throw them
at the body, head and limbs, to increase the bril-
liancy of its heavenly counterpart. “By-m-bye Ilwel
he come up big, he all same moon 1” The islanders
forecast the year’s yield by the star's brightness—
“S’pose Ilwel he plenty light, plenty yam, sweet
potato, banana, everything. S’pose he no come good
light, garden he come no good.” At the neighbor-
ing island of Murray, Ilwel figures in legend as
Meb, the bride of the moon. Once a month they
meet and cohabit, but a quarrel ensues, and Meb
leaves Ilwel, going further away every night.
Eventually they patch it up and meet again, without
lasting results, however.
* * * *
“Friday Island”: Faith and suggestion
play an important part in the healing of a sick
Melanesian native, and fear operates against success-
ful treatment. Let the medicine man tell black
brother that he is going to die and he will lie
down and get the job over. The medical superinten-
dent of the hospital at Thursday Island found it
necessary to operate on a native, and the method of
anajsthetising was explained to him. “Puttem rag
on face. This smell-stuff all same water wettern
rag. Aou smellem, you go sleep. Bimeby you wake
up more better.” The nig. got the idea. The
mask was no sooner placed on than the anaesthetist
reported to the surgeon that the patient was in a state
of complete antesthesia. Both doctors examined him
and agreed. At the conclusion of the operation the
surgeon touched the patient, who awakened to com-
plete sensibility and exclaimed, “My word, me tink
me more better this time. Him good fella that
smell-stuff.” No chloroform had been used.
* * * *
“Bilby”: I’ll wager that the bawksbill
turtle hangs on to life harder than
any other creature which inhabits the
waters within the Barrier Reef. A
few days back I watched the flesh
cleaned out of a hawksbill’s shell and
hung upon a tree, and for hours the
quivering, contrive movement of
the muscles went on. Last week we
caught a turtle on Whitsunday Island,
and only the head and tail were left
attached to the shell. Some time had
elapsed since the meat had been re-
moved, and no one could have
imagined that life remained in the
extremities. An aboriginal who was
standing by, noticing that the head
had its mouth wide open, inserted his
hand into the opening. The jaws
immediately dosed with a snap and
Binghi lost two fingers. Another abo.
tried to cut the horny tail off, but
as soon as his blade touched it on
the underside it curled up and gripped
the knife so firmly that it was
nearly an hour before the blade could
be withdrawn.
“Werrimee”: Many travellers have a bad
habit of lighting fires at the butt of a tree, and
they rarely, if ever, doss in the open away from
the shelter. No one can judge how long it will
take a tree to burn down when used as the back
of a camp-fire. A small tree may smoulder for days
and a big one may fall in a few hours. Another
dangerous fire is the one built against a hollow log.
All manner of horrible things come crawling out as
the heat eats its way into the interior. A Barwon
(O.) native used to surround himself with news-
paper pinned to the ground. Snakes, scorpions and
centipedes make a great noise crawling over or
under dry paper, and being a light sleeper the man
was always ready to receive visitors as soon as
they passed the threshold.
* • • *
“Aerabah” : That a horse will resort, under
the pressure of hunger, to cannibalism or next door
to it, is an established fact. After about 24 hours
without a feed or with only a negligible quantity,
the troop horses in Palestine used to indulge in a
meal of their next-door neighbors’ manes and tails.
Have seen a knocked-up horse with about half the
hair from his hide eaten away. Some horses are
more addicted to this practice than others. Nearly
all of them when hungry are partial to straps,
bridle reins and canvas rugs.
“A.C.S.”: Has any human being been
killed by a kangaroo in Australia ? I have seen
dogs drowned in dams by ’roos and others badly
mauled. For instance, last week one of our best
wallaby dogs went after a medium-sized old-man
kanga, and, as the tyke did not return for some
time, I followed the tracks to investigate. I found
him standing in his own entrails, with a rip about
18 inches long in his body. I had to finish the job
with a bullet.
FLU.
TEETOTAL VISITOR: “Well, y’know, I think I'm getting the wretched thing myself !
Patient: “I know what’ll cure you. Take ’ome a bottle of whisky and drink ’arf of it."
T.T. VISITOR: “That wouldn't do me any good."
PATIENT: “No? Well, then, drink the other - ’arf."
“Taka”: This is to introduce Checkers, a
small fox-terrior, of Fanning Island, whose most dis-
tinguished feature is a fondness for sport wherein the
spice of risk is included. The shallow waters around
the edges of the lagoon abound with small sharks,
and it is Checkers’ greatest pleasure to pass an
afternoon shark-hunting. His plan of campaign is
to head the game into stranding depth, then to
administer a shake-up and drag the victims ashore
for the knockout. His best effort so far is eight
in an hour; the ninth, tackled in water out of the
dog's depth, turned on him and drew blood. This
shark was about two and a half feet long. Some
time ago a big terrier here also had the shark-
hunting habit. He drifted ashore one day with
his throat bitten out.
* * * *
“Yaeko”: In several localities in S. Aus.
sheep suffer from a peculiar disease, commonly known
as “coasty,” and so far no one has found a remedy.
The cause is apparently in the feed growing in the
limestone and sandy patches along the coast. Fur-
ther inland and on the ironstone country the sheep
are not affected. Cows and horses also suffer. The
symptoms are the staggers and rapid loss of con-
dition, while the young remain stunted and grow
very shaggy coats. If they’re not moved in a few
months they die. The taste and supply of milk and
butter likewise deteriorate.
HE'D TRIED TO DO HIS BIT.
WOOLLIONAIRE (to prospective son-in-law) :
“Lemme arsk you one more question.
Was you ever, in person, at the late
Great War?"
P.S.I.L. : “ Well, no, not exactly in person.
But Ai’[?]e seen some awflay fame photo-
graphs of it, y’know!”
“Bad Australian”: The P.M. bad just got
through a long list at Bonehead Courthouse, and
the cabby who had been retained to take him to
* atcb th ? e f x P ress f or h °™ bad gone
back on him at the last minute. As there was
no time to lose, the Superintendent of Police put
his horse and trap and handy-man, Tommy the Nut,
at the disposition of the Beak, and the Nut was
instructed to catch the train at all costs. Tommy
had a firmly-rooted idea that the police were exempt
from the irritating’ legal restrictions imposed on
the ordinary citizen. So, taking his instructions
literally, he hit the convoy up to beat the clock.
About half-way between the courthouse and the sta-
tion, Bonehead bridge spans the Crooked River,
and this bridge was regarded as such a frail and
precious thing that the stranger within the gates
as- well as the citizen of Bonehead was liable to
be fined and thereafter severely lectured by a bunch
of hayseed jaypees for exceeding a three-mile bat
when riding or driving over the structure. When
Tommy hit the bridge he was on a 20-mile gait
or a few points better. The P.M., alarmed at
finding himself juggernauting one of Bonehead’s
most cherished by-laws, and fearing the result
of this outrage pn the dignity of the hayseed law-
givers, immediafjely ordered brakes down. Tommy
stared at him in astonishment for about three
seconds, then he cut loose: “Yell wanta ketch th’
blanky express, don’t yeh ? Don’t th’ flamin’ trap
b’long t’ th’ Super.? Ain't th’ (electric blue) prad
th’ property iv th’ condemned Guv’mint? Aw.
Gorstrutli, ain’t I th’ Super's offsider? An’, strike
me, ain’t you th’ magerstrit an’ th’ ’ead
serang w’en it comes t’ a show-down? Now, by cripes,
wot can they do to us ? Wot in’ ell can anybuddy
do w’en we got ’em like that?” Then Tommy put
in some more work with the accelerator, and dumped
the P.M. and his gripsack on the express a few
seconds ahead of the time-table. The Johns were
stone-blind on that occasion, and the hayseeds
couldn’t- see, and their deputy had apparently gone
out of business and nothing came of the incident.
Tommy knew'.

“Friday Island”: I scoff at the idea of
“Cape Pork” (B. 27/11/’l9) that wild quinine is
a cure for beri-beri. No known drug can cure it,
though symptoms may be relieved by drugs. The
disease is caused by a deficiency in the dietary.
Asiatic races suffer from it, especially Japs whose
food consists mostly of milled or polished rice, i.e.,
rice from which the covering has been removed.
In the Straits Settlements a group of men took
No. 1 polished Siam rice and developed beri-beri
within 60 days, while a party that used unpolished
rice remained well. Then the latter crowd was fed
on polished rice, and within two months developed
beri-beri. Takagi eradicated beri-beri from the Jap
navy by modifying the rice diet of the sailors.
Thursday Island Hospital is generally full of Japan-
ese pearl-divers with beri-beri who are being cured
by correct feeding, drugs being used only' for sj'mp-
tomatio side-lines.

ANTHONY UPON THE MURRAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Tony told the yarn to me
1 tried to make him smile
By telling him that Anthony
Had paid a higher price than he
For love upon the Nile.
He did not know the bloke, he said,
And 1 explained that he’d been dead
• For quite a little while.
The Murray stars are big and bright,
The Murray air is sweet,
And there is magic in the night
When paddles thrash the water white
And steady engines beat;
Tony was tempted and he took
His brown old fiddle from its hook,
And for’ard found a seat.
He stroked that fiddle into song
To speak to her for him ;
And as the old craft churned along
The passengers came in a throng',
And she was with them, slim
And tall and fair she stood close by
To hear the deck-hand’s music sigh,
There where the night was dim.
Then some went to the smoking-room,
And some went off to bed,
But she stood by him in the gloom
And he weaved love-lays on his loom
And knew her lips were red.
The river laughed on one soft tone,
And winked to see them left alone-
The things his fiddle said!
Instead of hearing some dull tale
Up in the close saloon
She lolled upon a bulging bale,
So close that Tony’s cheek grew pale,
While slow the round, red moon
Came up above the nodding trees
Which danced because a madcap breeze
Whispered a lilting croon.
THE UTILITARIAN.
HENARE : “I want te few board te timber."
JACKSON: “ Yes —how much, Henare?
What’s it for?"
HENARE: “Oh, my wife he sick. If he die
I make te koffim. If he live I make te
pigsty."
He moved up close; his fiddle’s voice
Kissed her upon the ear.
Her beauty made his heart rejoice,
And, since his feeling left no choice,
He banished doubt and fear.
Encouraged by a half-seen look
In his brown paws her hand he took—
She cooed and snuggled near.
The night had bathed them both in bliss,
The river gods were gay;
Tony had dreamed of things like this—
He snatched a warm and splendid kiss;
She had no word to say,
And so he did not stop at one.
She seemed to think that it was fun....
Then swift she sprang away.
Reading sweet coyness in 'her flight,
Poor Tony seized her waist.
A man who owned a heavy “right”
Rushed on him, joying in his might,
And with unseemly haste
He laid chill hands on Tony’s neck,
And tossed him down upon the deck
With evident distaste.
Then Tony felt a harder blow:
His dear one with a cry
Sprang to the strong man’s chest and “Oh! ”
She moaned, ‘.‘the brute had scared me so,
I thought that I would die.”
She fainted into his embrace
With outraged virtue on her face,
And thanks breathed in her sigh.
When Tony told his woe to me
l joked about the Nile,
And drew a cunning simile
Anent the other Antho'ny;
But Tony would not smile.
When I had done I heard him gasp:
“It yer can get a bloke an asp
I’ll make it worth yer while/''

“Phil Harum”: Accidents in the harvest
field are not uncommon, but here is one that is
not usually in the catalogue. John Grant, a
Trundle (N.S.W.) farmer, was driving his header-
harvester when he received a sunstroke and fell
from his seat on to the machine. There his leg
was caught in the fingers. He was pushed
along head foremost for 50 yards, whereabouts the
horses ran into a tree and stopped. Grant escaped
with no more hurt than a severely bruised leg.

“Bright” : Where did “Pick” (B. 4/12/’l9)
come across the kookaburra which when loaded to the
Plimsoll-mark killed snakes for the mere sport of
killing? 1 think it a slander on a good Australian,
as he is not such a Hun as that. There are dozens
of jackasses around the homesteads in the Riverina,
and I have watched them after a good meal sit
in a tree and look without concern at a wriggler
in the grass below. 1 have never yet seen a snake
that had been killed by a kookaburra and left with-
out being eaten. By the way, has any Aboite ever
come across a jackass that had been killed by a bite
from a snake?
* * * *
“H.G.R.” : Cats and birds usually do not
make the best of friends, but at my place a yellow
Tcm and a galah have become inseparable pals.
Any day I find the galah in some shady spot busily
engaged in “fleaing” the cat, Tom purring softly
as the job proceeds. Occasionally cocky nips him
with his sharp beak, and a free fight ensues. Fur
and feathers fly for a while, but the bird usually
comes out on top, for he is a skilful infighter, and
when his sharp beak gets to work puss soon skies
his tail. Then they make friends again. At night
the pair camp together in an old box —that is,
wheii Tom is not out marrying the neighbor’s Tabby.
Every morning I expect to find that Thomas has
made an early breakfast of the galah, but as yet
he has not attempted to do it.

“Half-moon”: Talk about the face at the
window! A diver in dress was down in Torres Strait
easily nine fathoms examining a sunken boat. Sud-
denly he was almost paralysed to see a black face
WINTABATINYANNA.
The authorities have decided to paint the names
of towns on the station roofs as a guide to aviators.
PILOT: “What township is that?”
OBSERVER : “If you turn round and run back
slowly I MIGHT be able to read the -
thing.”
peering 1 in at him through the glass of the helmet,
lie broke evens ascending. It transpired that a
native who had taken a fancy to see the bottom
had dipped overboard from the lugger, and on
arriving at his destination had looked in at the
dress diver’s face-glass. The man in the suit
thought that the sea was giving up its' dead.
“Billy T.”: Wall was bringing a big load
of sawn stuff down from the water-wheel mill at
the New Ford, his four fine horses stringing out
along the trolly line, his lead creaking and squeal-
ing as it swayed in its chains, when a small,
anxious Jewish gentleman suddenly thrust a nose
from the undergrowth, and said: “Hi, mithter, step
a minude, vill you?” Wall threw on his brakes and
THE ILLUSIVE MILLENNIUM.
THE PROPHET : “Socialism will give us equal
distribution of wealth."
THE PUNTER: “Will we get the same'for

pulled up. The small Hebrew fought his way
through bracken and scrub, and it was now seen
that he carried a portmanteau. “Look, mein friend,”
he said, “I haf sdart oud dis morningk from Brook-
field to go to Crisscross, und I tink der people
direcd me der wrong vay. Annyhow, I lose mein-
selluf. Vill you gif me der ride to Crisscross on
der truck? Yes?” Wall explained the dangers.
“There’s always a chance of things going wrong on
these steep inclines,” said he. “Sometimes the
trollies run off. You do it at your own risk, under-
stand that.” Aarons accepted the stipulation. “I
haf valket mein feed off me,” said he, “und I fear
me dot I vill lose mein train. Eef I lose mein
train dot redurn ticket vill expire out. So eet is
vcr’ impordant.” The driver took compassion on a
gentleman so seriously situated, and Aarons climbed
on top. All went well till they reached the dip
just over Pickle Hill. Here Wall uttered a shout
of warning. His brake-chain had parted. The load
surged forward on to the first horse, cracking his
spine. It lumbered after the second, got him, and
then the wheels jumped the wooden rail and the
great stack of timber crashed down into the bush.
Wall was thrown against a tree, and had a leg
broken. Aarons, still clinging to his portmanteau, was
dumped in a mass of bracken, and landed unscratched.
From his retreat he presently battled forth, and,
standing in the presence of the dead horses, the over-
turned stack of timber and the wounded driver, he
dropped his grip to ornament his plaint with effect-
ive gesture. “Now you’ve done id!” he cried.
“Shust see vot you’ve done!” thrusting his open
Watch under Wall’s nose. “Eet iss tventy to eleffen,
und at eleffen dot ticket vill oxpire!”

“Eddyson”: I have discovered a true bush
poet. He has never had a line published, but has
perpetrated more rhyme than any professional
actively operating the metrical mill in Australia.
He lives in Victoria, and he is now a venerable
rhymester, with much beard and more hair, both
white as snow. The neighbors call him “Rhyming
Ive.” If he meets a friend he does not say: “ ’Elio,
there, ’o\v are you?” after the prevalent manner;
he says:
“Good morning, Janies, I wish to say
The sun is warm. How’re you to-day?”
Wheli lie goes to the grocer he gives his order in
verse:
“A tin of jam, a loaf of bread,
A pound of butter, too, to spread.”
And for years he has met the postmistress with:
“Good morning, ma’am. Will you contrive
To find a letter for J. Ive?”"
1 remonstrated with him about it. He said: “Yes,
sir; it’s awkward, that I know; but, see, I caught it
years ago, as just a kid in dark bush lands, ‘lngoldsby
Legends’ in my hands. I read the book so many
times that I began to think in rhymes; and ever
since it’s hard to say a sentence in the common
way. The bloomin’ thing that’s to be said it just
comes dancing in my head. I can’t say ‘Gee up!’
to a horse. It trips out as a thing of course: ‘No
loafin’ now! Ged up, you cow! ’ ” He had settled
the small of his back comfortably to fit the stack
of spuds in the station yard, and I fled without
excuse, otherwise this might have gone on all morn-
ing.
“AYai-hoi”: The best Abo. art gallery I’ve
seen in the North is at the head of Admiralty Gulf,
between Wyndham and Derby (W.A.), in the rough
sandstone country round Mount Connor. The Lawley
River ploughs through the tableland, and all the
gorges and ravines thereabouts give the blacks plenty
of faced rock to decorate with colored ochres,
which they get further to the south. A big over-
hanging ledge, sloping back
into a maw-like cavern,
was fairly smothered with
all sorts of quaint sketches,
representing crocs., fish,
’roos, portraits of Binghi,
the missus and the kid,
and a battalion of figures
shaped like old George
Reid and done in white
ochre with patches of
charcoal here and there.
The most remarkable
feature of this last lot of
drawings was the absence
of a mouth, but as the
art of the Kimberley nigs
originally came with the
visiting Malays hundreds
of years ago the facial
shortage can easily be
accounted for. Up nor’-
west from Australia lepers
and the like smother up
the mouth with a cloth,
and the migrating Malay
boys, when they first
sailed to Kimberley, and
started to stock their
harems from amongst the
local gins, amused the
ladies by painting on the
rocks human beings with-
out mouths. Overland to
Wyndham I once came
across a patch of unusual
ground figures near the
Durack River. About 10
acres of marshy ground
was outlined with numerous representations of men
and crocodiles, as well as a few somethings that
looked like Charlie Chaplin upside down on stilts.
The longest figure was the artist’s idea of a real old-
man croc., 32ft. long and 4ft. across the chest.
* * * #
“Tarwin” : When the son and daughter of
neighboring cow-cockies got spliced, the arrangement
was that they should reside with the bridegroom’s
parents and help to work the place. The day after
the wedding I dropped in about cow-time to have
a pitch with the old chap, and was surprised to see
the newly-weds hard at work milking. “Didn’t they
have a honeymoon?” I asked dad. “Honeymoon 1 ”
he growled. “No time now to go honeymooning!
But we let ’em miss two milkin’s.”
“Bright": “Lever" (B. 11/12/’l9) asks,
for a cure for warts in cattle. When they are
small and pendulous they can be removed by snip-
ping off, the stump being touched with nitrate of
silver. Those of the broad and flattened variety
can be dissected out and the wound cauterised if
necessary. If they are large, get a piece of strong,
thin, white cord and tie it ae firmly as possible
around the base. This will make them shrivel and
drop off. If there is a tendency to grow again after
this apply acetic, nitric or chromic acid or nitrate
of silver. In cases where these cannot be had a
piece of iron made red-hot will serve the purpose.
Very often they will disappear if they are kept
soft by the use daily of sweet or olive oil.
‘'Choke Bore”: “F.R.’s” remarks (B.
23/10/’l9) regarding the fox being a dud as a
rabbit-killer do not apply to Gippsland, I have
opened the stomachs of dozens of the dogs during
the last six months, and nearly always found remains
of pussy, and rarely anything else. A few cupboards
contained feathers from apparently young birds, and
very occasionally I noticed that the menu had
been varied with opossum.
* * * *
“Nunk”: Talking about weighty rabbit
pelts, in Meadows (S. Aus.) good winter bucks’
skins have gone four to the pound.
* * * *
“Delhi”: If the Abo. who owns a worm-
infested prad has not yet found a satisfactory cure
let him try this. Take a stalk of leaves of the
rue plant and wrap in a handful of grass. Feed
this to the nag twice a day for a week, and the
worms are done for. The horse appears to be im-
mune from further attacks after this treatment. If
the prad owner hasn’t any rue in stock any nursery-
man will supply the plants, and they are easily
grown.
* * * *
“Acrabah” : Lack of sleep produces weird
results. In Palestine palm-trees, lights and run-
ning waters were my specialties. My cobber suf-
fered from holes in the ground, and was everlast-
ingly pulling his horse round imaginary obstacles.
During the Amman raid a Digger of my acquaint-
ance went to sleep in the bed of a small mountain
stream, the channel being dry at the time. Twenty
minutes later, after a sharp shower, the stream
started to run. The Digger, who was sleeping in
a sitting position, was not disturbed, but slum-
bered peacefully on with water up to his armpits.
Everyone was too dead-beat to even laugh at him,
and only when the water crept up to his chin did'
someone summon sufficient energy to drag him out.
* * * *
“Choke Bore”: Gippsland is not reckoned
wool-growing country, but I doubt if any Northern
sheepmen can produce anything to beat this. Two
sportsmen, shooting near Morwell, found a brace
of sheep on an island in the centre of MacMillan’s
•Swamp. They had been there for four years un-
known to their owner, and during that time had
not been shorn. The fleece of one weighed 371 b.,
and in places was over 36in. long without a break
in the wool.
* * * *
“1627”: I decided to spend the night at
the old wayside shanty and get an early start in
the morning, but was afraid I might sleep in. There
was no alarm clock, but the landlord said he had
an unfailing substitute and would set it for day-
light. An empty kerosene tin and a length of cord
with a weight attached to one end were procured.
The tin was placed close to the bedside, the weighted
ell( t of the cord in the tin and the other end passed
through a hole in the wall. To this end was
attached a piece of bread arranged to hang a
ishort distance from the ground. The fowls, the
boss assured me, would find it in the morning and I
would hear them. I did.
“Taka”: What’s the biggest shark caught
in Australian waters? Here, on Fanning Island,
our record was a 23-footer, captured by a native on
a thin, island-made cocoanut-fibre line after four
hours’ gentle persuasion.
THE PRECEDENT.
MRS. GRUNDY : “Sir, I shall have to report
you to my executive for admitting
hussies in bathing costumes.”
ST. PETER : “Well, while you're about it
come in and have a quiz at the old
originals in their fig leaves.”
Bellchambers, the South Aus. naturalist,
has invented a new kind of duck. He has crossed
the native bird with the imported, and has
evolved something that has the merits of both. It
is like a Rouen duck, only more so. It is to be
called the Galway breed, after the just-leaving S.
Aus. Governor, who has always had a kindly eye
for Bellchambers’s encouragement of Nature’s
amateurish efforts.

“Bill Bowyang”: Here is Binghi’s legend
of the manini, a Small fish in Barrier Reef waters.
Once a native found a small manini which he kept
as a pet in a cocoanut-shell, and fed it until it
grew too large for its prison. He then went to a
coral lagoon and placed the fish in a pool,
hut as it still increased in size he threw it into
the lagoon and fed it every morning. Later on
several natives from a neighboring island visited
the lagoon and speared the manini.
They towed it behind a canoe, as
it was too heavy to take on board,
arid when they arrived at their vil-
lage they divided the fish into as
many pieces as there were people,
and gave each person his share. Now
the oldest inhabitant, who was a
female, received the heart as her
share. She did not eat it, but
placed it in a cocoanut-shell. When
the owner of the manini found how
his fish had been killed he followed
the natives to their island. Meeting
the old woman who had kept the
heart he questioned her, and then
went to the village, where he called
all the people together and told
them to find any pieces of the fish
which had not been eaten. The
natives collected all the bones and
small pieces they could find, and
when the owner of the fish received
them he killed everyone on the island
except the old woman who had kept
the manini’s heart. He then took
the pieces of the fish back to his
island, went down to the lagoon
and threw them into the water. As
each piece fell into the lagoon it
turned into a tiny manini. And
these fish lived, but they never grew any larger.
From that day all manini have been small.

THE FLETCHER-RUSSELL GAS COOKER
POINTS THE WAY TO ECONOMICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COOKING.
It is the doyen of the Stove world, and has been used in Australia for thirty
years. Some of the original Cookers are still in use. The latest patterns
are constructed with double-cased ovens, which are thickly jacketed with
non-conducting material.
This retains the heat, and keeps the oven hot at a small
expenditure of gas. Roasting and baking are economical
as well as pleasurable.
£l3lo'-
The hot plate contains three boiling and one grill burners. The parts which
do wear out, such as these, can always be replaced. They just slip into their
places—no screwing, no trouble. The “FLETCHER” costs a little more,
but it’s worth it.
POPULAR AMERICAN GAS COOKERS.
American Cookers have many points of excellence, and have become popular.
The large size is table high, and prevents stooping, saving fatigue. They are
well finished and come in three sizes. No lis large enough for a family of
four.
PRICES *
No. 1, £5/10/-; No. 2, £8; No. 3, £l4/10/-
AUSTRALIAN GAS COOKERS.
Australian Makers have progressed since the fine national spirit first
animated them, till they now offer stoves of the utmost reliability, made for
long wear, and saving in the use of gas. They are solidly made and carry
the usual number of burners on substantial hotplates. In a wide range of
sizes to meet all needs.

iucluded; and in that there was encourage-
ment.
But there is more even that Asia. The
missionary is in the witness-box now :
Some Americans talk as if they had the right to
control the Pacific. Why should we regard our
claim to the supremacy of the Pacific as superior
to that of nations which have occupied territory on
that ocean for more than two thousand years? It
may be that the Japanese are over-ambitious and
offensively self-assertive. I suspect that they are,
and that we ourselves belong to the same category.
There is not much comfort for us of Aus-
tralia in that. But there is a very definite
warning.
The Mastery of the Far East is not all
or nearly all political. There is a vast
amount of good description in it. For
those who are interested in that line there
are a couple .of hundred pages of mission-
ary talk. Incidentally there is a quaint touch
which suggests that it may have been these
mission-revivalists who gave the idea of
Liberty Loan “drives.” At any rate, there
is the record of the “Million Campaign for
Christ,” when “every theatre and public
hall in Seoul [the Korean capital] was en-
gaged for a month, so that no other public
meetings or entertainments could be given
to distract attention. A column a day was
secured in. each of the six daily papers.
Every family in the city was visited every
day for six days.” And the million? Well,
"between 400 and 500 professed conversion;
hut almost none of them can be found now.”
And Japan, keeping in the background,
smiled and carried on.
The Lincoln Tradition
This was almost the first thing that struck
my eye when I began to read United States
Admiral Sims's story of the war “When Ger-
many Nearly Won”:—
I think of the Prime Minister of Great Britain
[Lloyd George] as a big, exuberant boy; always
laughing and joking, constantly indulging in re-
partee and by-play, and even in this—perhaps the
darkest crisis of British history—ever bubbling with
merriment.... It is a picture which 1 shall never
forget—that of this man on whose shoulders the
destiny of the Empire mainly rested, refusing to
admit even to himself the dangers that were seem-
ingly crushing it to extinction There is indeed
only one other case in history that can be com-
pared with it: for Lloyd George's attitude at this
period constantly reminded me of Lincoln in the
darkest hours of the Civil War....
My complaint is that, whenever <i man wins
a great battle, or writes a great book, or
paints a great picture, or devises a great
reform, or puts out a fire, or rescues a fellow-
creature from drowning, or goes unusually
high in an airship, or unusually low in a
diving-suit, or unusually sideways when dodg-
ing a knock-out blow, it reminds some U.S.
person of Lincoln. In fact, the story of
how Moses imitated Lincoln in the Pen-
tateuch is a classic.
Lincoln stood for a very big, rich, well-
armed community fighting a very small,
badly-armed one. It wasn’t a case of North
against South, but of North and West and
South-West against South-East. The Union
which Lincoln represented wasn’t threatened
with conquest, looting, imposition of indemni-
ties, loss of colonies, destruction of its
civilisation or its commerce or its shipping—
it wasn’t even menaced with incivility, dog-
matism or procrastination. The South-East
States merely wanted to go in peace, and
whether they had a right to quit or not no
one can tell to this day. Probably they had,
for there was nothing in the Constitution to
the contrary—in fact, no one dared to in-
clude in the Constitution a proviso against
secession from the Union, for if that had
been done there would probably have been
no Union. Secession had been talked of
often enough both north and south —in
Massachusetts first. President Jackson iaid
it down that States which wanted to leave the
voluntary combine might be held against
their will —he was a hard, masterful, buffalo-
chasing sort of man from the Middle West,
was “Old Hickory,” but no lawyer—and Lin-
coln followed him. So Lincoln fought a very
small enemy in a very dubious cause. He
didn’t even fight to abolish slavery. In his
address to Congress on his election, and
before the war commenced, he promised to
preserve slavery and to enforce the laws for
the return of fugitive slaves to their owners
for spanking and other purposes.
What Lincoln would have done if a fool
on the other side hadn’t let a gun go off no
one can imagine. He was elected President
in November, 1860. In December South
Carolina (about the size of Tasmania and
containing a few people) resigned from the
Union, and set up for itself. Six more
States followed, but Virginia, the great
original State, which had supplied Presidents
for 36 years out of the 72 years during which
there had been Presidents, didn't join them.
Seven slave States in all refused to secede.
The seven that had seceded sat and looked
at Lincoln. Lincoln sat and looked at them.
He said he wouldn’t let them quit, but did
nothing except send back to them their
escaped slaves. They said they had quitted
and that it was no use arguing against facts.
But the situation was so absurd that a poli-
tician from Alabama told Secession President
Davis that unless something happened his
State would be back inside the Union in a
month—to avoid the mirth of the comic
papers, or something like that.
The trouble came to a head over a rock
with a Union fort on it inside Charleston
harbor (South Carolina). If the Northern
Government gave it up and withdrew the
garrison it would thereby acknowledge the
new republic of South Carolina, plus seces-
sion and the right to secede. If South Caro-
lina didn’t get the rock its secession wasn’t
complete. If South Carolina had contented
itself with registering an annual protest
against the occupation of a bit of its terri-
tory the two parties might be looking at
each other to this day, and there might have
been 50 protests by now. There are coun-
tries which keep a claim alive after that
fashion for a very long time, and sometimes
they come out right in the end. * In the
meantime surreptitious attempts might have
been made to dissolve the rock with vinegar
by night. But South Carolina lost its head,
and after a desperate battle in which nobody
was killed on either side the rock surren-
dered. The fighting had begun and the
South had made up Lincoln’s mind for him.
In the hurry that ensued the seven slave
States which hadn’t seceded were ordered to
supply troops to put down the seven that
had. This made up their minds, and four
(or rather 3£) decided to fight for the South,
as they had to fight in any case. So the
war really started after half a year’s delay.
If nothing had been said to the other seven
slave States they might be hesitating still.
While the Confederacy was being slowly
hacked to pieces and starved out by the
stupendous forces at Lincoln’s command the
cheerfulness and lofty confidence of the Presi-
dent attracted everybody’s attention. The
thing that most resembled it was the ca(p
of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in
London during the Ashantee campaign of
1574. Lincoln was a very big man, but he
wasn’t up against such a vast proposition,
after all. A pathetically bad selection of
Northern generals made it big. Lloyd George
suggested Isaiah, the indomitable prophet
who kept up the courage of the flickering
Hezekiali when the Assyrian wolves raged
round Jerusalem. Lincoln rather resembled
a boxer who found his small opponent unex-
pectedly dangerous, but smiled even in the
17th round and won in the 20th.

gluttony, luxury, wrath, envy, avarice and
sloth. The book just saves itself with th*
gluttony yarn. The glutton’s favorite gorge
was pie. One day a friend told him that
his pies were mud compared with those of
the Khan of Barbary. En route to Barbary
for the recipe his ship was captured by
pirates and he was taken before the Khan.
No use were the cries and entreaties of Denis:
the Khan’s master-cook entered the cell and dis-
patched hiru, and in several portions they con-
veyed him away to the kitchens; flavored with bam-
boo shoots and mustard he ted the Khan’s lampreys
for a week.
The Clouds of Aristophanes, by Benjamin
Biekley Rogers (Bell, London). This is
the first of a series of translations of the
separate plays of Aristophanes. The verse
is good and much of the humor—coarse,
loud humor mostly at the expense of Soc-
rates—leaks through into English. They
were not highly sensitive, the crowd at the
Great Dionysia in 423 B.c. No English-
speaking crowd anywhere would stand that
grossness .to-day. Still, it is good to have
the mind of Athens, if only for the sake of
perspective, and here it is rendered con-
vincingly into our own tongue.
A Souvenir of 11. M. T. Main. There is
no publisher's name on this book, but in-
side is a short preface by Professor R. S.
Wallace and an acknowledgment of author-
ship by Wm. C. Harding. The verse is
fair quality throughout, with glimmers of
humor and touches of exaggeration which
get tolerably close to humor. Sapper Hard-
ing must have done a good deal to hearten
H. M. T. Main on the homeward voyage.
The Inky Way
“Dido” : Though I knew Victor Daley for
many years, I saw him in evening-dress only
once, and on that occasion I chanced upon
him in the stalls’ vestibule of the old Alec
theatre. The turnout was complete, from
shoes to crush hat. and very effective. Victor
was also smoking a cigar—for the first time
to my knowledge. I was afterwards given
to understand that the outfit had been pro-
vided by a Member of Parliament, “the Little
Doc,” whose electors Victor was to edify
that evening with an address. But Daley
had forgotten his mission. He took posses-
sion of me, and we had something, and the
bard imparted his trouble. “I was to go
somewhere and take part in some function,
but I’ve forgotten what, and I don’t know
where. It was very important. I wish
you’d try to recollect,” said he. Of course.
I couldn’t. We returned to the theatre, and
sat out an act, Victor drowsing by my side.
When the curtain fell and the lights went
up, the poet opened his eyes, blinked, and
then arose on two unsteady legs, and address-
ing the theatre, said, “Ladies and gentle-
men, the subject on which I am invited to
address you this evening is the duty of
the citizen towards the State, as contrasted
with the duty of the State towards the citi-
zen.” Victor had recollected.
LOVE-IN-A-MIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What do I note in the passionate night,
By the shivery stars’ entrancing light?
With a curious gaze and rapt, 1 see
In the drooping depths of the shrubbery
Frank Morton, snared in his ladye’s hair,
Painting new words on her ankles fair.
What is that noise in the scented dark—
Burbles and murmurs of gladness ? Hark !
Racket of passion and screams of bliss!
Tell me, my heart, what to make of this!
It’s Love-in-a-Mist with the Morton boy,
Squeezing him till he squeals with joy.
Listen! A voice in the midnight gloom,
Seductive and syrupy-syllabled (boom!),
Rhythmical, scrumptiously cadencing
Like a jew’s-harp (thump !) in a beehive(bing !).
It’s Morton, adoring his latest tart
To the frenzied thud of his thundering heart!
In the languorous murk of the yum-yum tree
Anyone happening by may see
Morton and his young-lady friend
Suffering transports of bliss, no end —•
Morton alone with his Love-in-a-Mist
Insistent on having her eyebrows kissed.

THE DENTAL DISPLAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas at the party up at Bent’s
To welcome Andy back.
The lady witn sly blandishments,
And eyes so wondrous black,
Oft smiled on me ;
And 1 could see
Her teeth more white than snow may be.
If I but glanced at her a smile
She flashed my -way again.
I’m not a man of rakish guile
Fond women to enchain,
But after this
’Twas not amiss
To try to steal a little kiss.
She screamed. The blow she gave almost
Removed one half my head.
I sadly pleaded to our host
The smiles the lady shed.
“That’s innocent
Advertisement.
She is the dentist’s wife!” said Bent.

“Huffin-Guffin”: There appears to be a
horrible understanding in our Vic. township
that duty stamps (on receipts over £2)
are immoral and should be avoided. To
divide the account intq two or more is the
commonest trick. Rut you should hear those
same fellows talk about patriotism!
“Chev”; Money in pigs! A sow, cross
between a medium and a large white York,
has in six litters farrowed a total of 103
pigs! Her first litter was 12, which she
followed up with 18, 17, 10 and 17, and her
last litter, dropped on November 17, num-
bered 20. This prolific female is three years
and three months old, and she belongs to
E. J. Cook, a N.S.W. North Coast farmer.
“R.A.Y.”: I wonder how the shipbuilding
work now being done in Australia will com-
pare with that of the steamer Perseverance,
built at Mort’s Dock, Sydney, in 1867. The
old craft was docked recently on the Clar-
ence River to have some plates renewed.
Most of the original plates, the frames and
other parts were found to be good for many
years yet—this after half a "century’s ser-
vice.
Kangaroo Island, (S.A.), which thought it
was doing good business before the war in
shipping yacca (grass-tree) gum to Ger-
many, was annoyed on learning that it had
been supplying material for h.-e. used
against our own men. The trade has been
almost dead for five years, but is now look-
ing up again. England and U.S.A. both
ask for it, and other countries are nibbling.
The output immediately available is said to
be about 1000 tons—and it takes a lot of
gum to weigh a ton.
“Charing X”: “Flinders Lane” (B.
6/11/T9) talks of the posters on railway
stations having lost a lot of their advertis-
ing value as the result of the introduction
of electricity to the Melbourne suburban
train service. But those ads. are mostly for
travellers who come down to a station and
have to wait for a train. Take, for example,
the great underground stations of London.
The trains there do not even wait the 20
seconds referred to by “Flinders Lane.” Yet
some beautiful ads. are displayed. These
are not for the admiration of the passengers
seated in the cars. The most gorgeous of
them are on the side of the tube away from
the platform on which passengers wait; so
that, even if the passengers in the cars did
wish to read them, they could not, because
that side of the tunnel is only about two
inches from the car itself.
“0.K.”: I see the time coming, if it hasn’t
already arrived, when patent-medicine adver-
tisers will make some of their exes, out of
aspirants for fame in any branch of art or
business. The man with a cure for shooting-
pains in the shin-bone will publish a testi-
monial from Sadson Merrydad, the famous
tragedian and author of a thrilling emotional
play that no one ever heard of. A beauteous
photo will show the Unrivalled Author-Actor
at Home. This will be the; world’s first inti-
mation that Sadson Merrydad lives, and he’ll
pay the medicine man handsomely for it.
Or a cheap cash tailor will announce his
gratitude to the inventor of Scarlet Pills for
Shooting Shinbones, whose wondrous specific
enabled him to continue his great work of
supplying the public with Renowned Serge
Suits and Extra Pockets at the reduced price
of £9 19s. lid. No longer will a Lauder
get a fee for puffing a brand of tea" Instead,
a Frauder will pay one for getting his photo
into somebody’s Bunion Balm advertisement.
“Joe Blow”: Bluey was detailed as one
of a party of four to escort a few hundred
Jacko prisoners from Semakh, and foiyad
time to collect a few souvenirs, amongst them
an alleged bullet-proof vest, at one time the
property of a German medical-officer. Dur-
ing the Gyppo rising Bluey had a few days’
leave in Cairo and drifted to Gabriel’s, the
old 6th Light Horse haunt. Gabriel, being
an Armenian, was a bit windy at the time,
and approached Bluey with a view to buving
his automatic. Bluey strongly advised Gabriel
as to the penalties he would incur if he car-
ried firearms, but suggested to him the pur-
chase of a dinkum Australian armor-plated
waistcoat, of which, he stated, only four had
been manufactured, owing to their great cost.
One each was worn by Generals Allenby
and Birdwood and himself, whilst the fourth
was retained by the designer. General Ned
Kelly. “Oh! Le grande brigande?” says
Gabriel. “My oath!” says Bluev. Fifteen
quid was the price, and I got half.
“Settled”: Randolph Bedford was reck-
less as usual when lie wrote about Babinda
(B. 9/10/T9). He said that this Banana-
land mill crushed 30,000 tons of cane last
season, whereas it crushed about 93.000 tons.
He also broke the news that its capacity is
38 to 42 tons per hour, that we have 150!000
tons to crush and that there will likely be
20,000 tons stand-over. Having recently
visited Babinda, Bedford should know that
it is intended to run the mill 32 weeks, and
splitting the difference between what the
mill was built to do (38 tons) and is doing
(42 tons) per hour for 32 weeks, it should
get through 174,320 tons; so where does
the 20,000 tons of stand-over come in? Re
his assertion that the squeal about lost juice
is bogus, I am of a different opinion, and
I’m one that has been growing cane for
Babinda since its inception. Anyway, as
Australia will have to import something
in the vicinity of £3.000,000 worth of sugar
this year, some prooer inouirv should be
made as to whether there is loss' or not. I’m
one of many who believe there is.


OF DR. MORSE’S INDIAN MOOT
The consistent efficacy of Dr. Morses Indian Root Pills is the real reason for the continued
and ev er~in creas ing demand for this remedy. Letters from all parts of Australia and New
Zealand in praise of these pills are continually being received by the Proprietors. Space
will not permit reproducing anything like the number received, but the few here printed
go to show the widespread popularity of this remedy. For every letter published there are
thousands of people who will speak in sitnilar terms.
ARMIDALE.
Mrs. M. Fitzgerald. Barney Street,
Armidale, N.S.W., writes:
“It is interesting to record of the good
Dr. Morse’s Indian Iloot Pills have done
me. I was a martyr to biliousness and sick
headaches for some time before taking 1 your
pills. After taking a dose of the pills I can
say they are what they are claimed to be, as
they relieved me of the above complaints. I
speak of your pills as an unrivalled and
a most reliable medicine for banishing the
above ailments. I recommend these pills
to such sufferers, as I have found them
to be an undoubtedly good corrective
medicine.”
GISBORNE.
Mrs. Mary McKinley, 303 Aberdeen
Road, Gisborne, N.Z., writes:
“I am a great believer in Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, having derived much
benefit from their use in combating indi-
gestion and constipation. I was formerly
a martyr in suffering from indigestion,
and accordingly now recommend these
pills to my friends and acquaintances.”
WHANGAREI.
Mrs. Caroline Conaghan, Cameron
Street, Whangarei, N.Z., writes:—
“I can assert that Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are a useful medicine for cor-
recting that tired feeling or languor and
fatigue arising from a sluggish liver. I
am a resident of AVhangarei, nineteen
years and mother of five children.”
HOWARD.
Mrs. E. Raines, William Street,
Howard, Q’land, writes:—
“To anyone who values good health, I
would recommend Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills every time. I have used this
remedy as occasion required for a good
many years, with the very best results,
having enjoyed good health all the time.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills not only
regulate the system, but tone it up as
well, and by increasing the pleasure of
existence, make life really worth while.”
KALGOORLIE.
Nurse M. G. Bourke, 100 Collins
Street, Piccadilly, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
writes:—-
“I can certify that Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are an excellent medicine for
rectifying constipation. Occasionally I
have recommended them to my patients
in my capacity of certified maternity
nurse. I have been twenty-four years in
Kalgoorlie, practising throughout that
period as medical, surgical and maternity
nurse.”
NORTH PERTH.
Mrs. Bessie Murphy. 3 Randall Street,
North Perth, W.A., writes: —
“I can say Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are an unequalled and most reliable
medicine for banishing kidney trouble, of
which I was a victim. I suffered from
severe pains in the back and for days
could not do any work. After I had
taken a dose of your pills I soon felt the
pains going away. I continued taking
doses till I had emptied one bottle, and
since then I have not had a recurrence.
I strongly recommend these pills to like
sufferers.”
RUTHERGLEN.
Mr. Francis C. Lott, Brown’s Plains,
Rutherglen, Vic., writes:—
“I have used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills for many years. Whenever I suffer
with slight bilious attacks these pills
always rectify my health, and I can per-
sonally recommend them as a genuine
‘Liver Pill.’ M.v wife also finds them
useful occasionally. During the past
fourteen years I have been employed, on
the Victorian Railways, and am well
and favorably known.”
ENFIELD.
Mrs. M. H. Bowden, Great North
Itoad, Enfield, S.A., writes:—
“At times I was troubled with costive-
ness, and tried Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. I found these pills very mild in
their action; they do not gripe like so
many other so-called remedies.”
KENSINGTON.
Mrs. M. E. Unswortli, 11 Regent
Street, Kensington, S.A., writes:—
“I find excellent results from the use
of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills in ward-
ing off biliousness. I have suffered many
bilious attacks and tried several medi-
cines, but none equal to your remedy for
this ailment.”
HINDMARSH.
Mrs. Marion Smith, 15 Robert Street,
Hindmarsh, S.A., writes:—
“Sometime ago I was a sufferer from,
indigestion, and took a course of Dr.’
Morse’s Indian Root Pills on the persua-
sion of a friend. I am pleased to relate
that I derived much benefit from this
remedy, and can now recommend them
accordingly to any similar sufferers.”
PARKSIDE.
Mrs. Adelaide Fry, 33 Victoria Street,
Parkside, S.A.:
“I was a great martyr to rheumatics
in Longreach, Q., and at times could not
move from my bed. My mother was a
great believer in Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills, and through her instrumentality I
took your remedy and found them relieve
my suffering always. I now take them
occasionally and my state of health is
usually very good.”
UNLEY.
Mrs. Eva May Rowney, 30 Charles
Street, Unley, S.A.:—
“My mother first induced me to use
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as I was a
great sufferer from biliousness. I usually
find that a dose of pills wards off any
recurrence of bilious disorder. I am an
old resident of Bordertown and mother of
five children.”
WANGANUI.
Mrs. Catherine Nyon, 51 Harrison
Street, Wanganui, N.Z., writes:
“I had been suffering from kidney
trouble for some years, when I decided to
give Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills a trial.
I can testify to their efficacy in my case,
and I recommend them to my friends.”
HOBART.
Mrs. Douglas Coombe, 33 Brisbane
Street, Hobart, Tas., writes:—
“I was a great sufferer with rheuma-
tism for a period of two or three years,
and was under the doctor for some time,
but this complaint proved most persistent,
and consequently I had found little relief
when I came in contact with one of your
pamphlets and decided to give Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills a trial. I then under-
went a course of your pills and found in
less than six months that I was relieved
of the rheumatism altogether, and I can-
not recommend this medicine too highly,
and frequently praise the pills to my
friends and acquaintances. My husband
also finds them beneficial, and they provide
our family medicine.”
ZEEHAN.
Mrs. W. Wallace, Grubb’s Train
Road, Zeehan, Tas., w r rites: —
“I can assert that Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills are beneficial for the relief
of biliousness, and can personally recom-
mend them to similar sufferers. I am an
old resident of this township and mother
of two children.”
ULVERSTONE.
Nurse Janet Cameron, West Ulver-
stone, Tas., writes:—
“I desire to certify to the efficacy of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Fills as a genu-
ine remedy for the relief of indigestion.
Many years ago I first tried this medicine,
and have frequently recommended I)r.
Morse’s Indian Root Fills also ns a laxa-
tive to my patients in my capacity as a
maternity nurse, where I followed this
profession for many years past. I was
trained in Melbourne, Victoria.”
SOUTH GORE.
Mrs. Edith E. Johnston, Redmond
Street, South Gore, N.Z., writes:—
“I have a very good opinion of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills for relieving
indigestion and constipation. I was re-
commended by a friend to take these pills
and can now accordingly speak of their
merit.”
NOWRA.
Mrs. Ponce, Berry Street, Nowra,
N.S.W., writes:—
“It is a pleasure to write of the good
results I have obtained from the use of
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for keeping
the liver in good order. I suffered from
severe headaches and a sluggish liver, but
I now take a dose of your pills twice a
week, therefore I never get a recurrence
of my old complaint. I am a great be-
liever in your pills. I also recommend
them to such sufferers.”
SOUTH WAGGA.
Mrs. Rowena Gray. Lewisham, South
Wagga, N.S.W., writes: —
“I followed a sedentary life as a school-
teacher for twenty-five years and became
a victim to constipation. At that period
I was a resident of Western Australia and
occasionally visited Perth, W.A., where
I consulted a doctor. lie recommended
my using Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
as I was a relieving teacher and at times
far removed from the chance of obtaining
medical advice —he advised my always
keeping Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills on
hand. I cannot speak too highly of this
remedy, and still find them useful with
myself, husband and family.”
LEICHHARDT.
Mr. John Beeby. 173 Flood Street,
Leichhardt, N.S.W., writes:—
“After ten years of perpetual suffering
from kidney and liver complaints, and
during that time trying medicines of all
kinds without relief, my wife advised me
in December. 1917, to try Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. I took her advice, and
in February, 1918, my pains left me, and
up till now I have been free from pain,
through the constant use of the pills
every third day. I am a carpenter and
joiner. I have for years worked in pain,
when many would have given up in de-
spair. I can only give credit to Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills for my splendid
state of health to-day. If you care to,
you may publish this with a view of help-
ing some fellow-workman who may suffer
as J did. I always found the pills did
their work best if I took them going
to bed.”
YEA.
Mrs. Harriet May Wilson, High
Street, Yea, Vic., writes:
“I was first recommended to try Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills for the relief
of indigestion. I used to suffer a terrible
lot with indigestion and a weak back. I
tried other remedies, but found Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills act in a much
better manner in my case than any other
remedy. I am a native of this district,
and you may use this testimony in what-
ever manner desired for publicity.”
BEECHWORTH.
Mr. Prank Snow, Atkinson Road,
Beech worth, Vic., writes:
“Some two years ago I had occasion to
use Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as I
was then suffering from kidney trouble.
I am pleased to say that I found much
relief from your remedy, and conse-
quently can now recommend them to like
sufferers.”
LAUNCESTON.
Mr. A. Phillips, 3 Goodwin Street,
Inveresk, Launceston, Tas., writes:
“I have used Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills for the relief of kidney trouble and
can recommend these pills to like sufferers,
having personally found most beneficial
results from their use. The claim made
for Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills being
an efficacious remedy I can substantiate
personally.”
MILTON.
Mrs. Catherine Davies, McDougal
Street, Milton, Q’land, writes:—-
“A chemist recommended me to try
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills for severe
sick headaches and pains in the back. I
would feel quite dizzy, with the head
throbbing so, just as if I was going to
fall forward. My back would ache so
that I could hardly stoop. These attacks
would last about a couple of days at a
time. Sometimes I would have to take
to my bed with them, for I couldn’t hold
up any longer. I could not fancy any-
thing to eat, and would be so qualmish.
It is only a few months since I started
the course, taking two pills each night;
it is wonderful the good they have done
me. I shall always keep them by me
and speak of them with gratitude.”
WANGARATTA.
Mrs. W. Boyle, Wilson Road, Wan-
garatta, Vic., writes:—
“I wish to state that I have found Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills act in a mild
and satisfactory manner for the relief
of constipation. Occasionally they also
prove useful with my family when costive.
I am a native of this township and life-
long resident.”
ROCKHAMPTON.
Mrs. E. F. Bates, 396 East Street,
Rockhampton, Q’land, writes:—
“It is now eleven years since I was
cured of chronic indigestion by using Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. My doctor
gave my case up as incurable and said he
could do no more for me. After every
meal I used to have a hot burning sensa-
tion at the pit of the stomach, with fer-
mentation of food and flatulence; and I
was also troubled with constipation. I
suffered from great depression of spirits,
and was in such a low condition that I
could hardly do any work, or take inter-
est in anything, and life was not worth
living. In this extremity I was advised
to try Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and
as I felt such great relief from the very
first dose, I was encouraged to give this
medicine a fair trial, and as my health
began to improve with almost every dose
I took, I continued with this medicine for
several weeks, at the end of which, to my
great surprise and joy, I found myself
completely cured—and I have remained
cured. I continued to use this medicine
occasionally for regulating the system and
do so still.”
NAPIER.
Mrs. M. M. Tanner, 7 Edwardes
Street, Napier, S., N.Z., writes:
“It is gratifying to be able to state
that I have derived much benefit from the
use of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,
being a sufferer from indigestion.”
are a purely vegetable preparation. They are not advertised as a cure-all, but as a corrective for everyday ills. They purify
the blood, cleanse the stomach, put life into the liver, stimulate the kidneys to perform their proper function, and will prevent
many of the ailments so common if taken occasionally to keep the system in proper working order. In thousands of homes
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are the Sole Family Remedy for all general complaints.

The open door to
bigger production
is better metal
goods!
ANYONE who produces metal goods
from the sheet, bar or pipe can
promptly increase his output by
using the Thomson Electric Welding Process
in place of seaming, riveting or fire welding.
Thomson Electric Welding not only produces
any kind of metal article at an amazing speed
but it turns out goods of superior quality in
every way.

V.
The man operating a Thomsofci Spot Welder on the right is producing automobile mufflers
from 24-gauge iron. There are 56 separate welds in each muffler, and the Thomson
Spot Welder produces 30 pieces per h0ur—13,440 welds in 8 hours! This shows forcibly
how any producer of metal goods can speed up his output——can rival imported metal
goods in quality and beat them in price.
No Australian manufacturer who produces metal articles by old-fashioned processes can
hope to undersell high-quality low-priced imported metalware that is mostly produced by
modern electric welding. Let the Thomson Electric Process put new life into your
production. Tell us what you produce or want to produce. Our advice is quite without
obligation.

The ’Loo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is not a slum, or criminal, or shabby-
genteel, although all these are part of
its spirit. It is not theatrical, although
that, too, overflows into it sometimes. Work-
men live there, and a few thieves; office-
cleaners, drunks, and “occasional” cooks;
the few who decide to reduce the motley
and tinsel temporarily, and the many who
are forced permanently to do that. Nearer
the docks the atmosphere is more patently
discreet than that of Cathedral-street, per-
haps. Sometimes in the night a man-hunt
passes your window ; the terrifying battering
of the feet of dumb men on the pavement
through the dark shrivels the imaginative
ear by its meaning. In broad daylight it
is a forgotten backwater, quiet and lazy,
and with the watchful eyes of lazy folk.
Sometimes you catch it unawares. Very
early one morning I walked from the baths
to Crown-street wearing rubber shoes. Com-
ing towards me a noticeably well-dressed
man, the thing the New York press calls
a “clubman,” stopped at a broken gate as
we met —the broken gate of an empty, shut-
tered house, at one time a Chinese laundry.
The man’s face was grey and strained; by
his desperate eyes he was suffering some
extreme of mental pain or craving, lie walked
quickly to the door of the squalid, empty
house, and tapped at it, without seeing me.
It was opened instantly by a Chinaman
who smiled a silent greeting to the dis-
traught visitor, and held the door open. The
“clubman” entered ; and the Chinaman saw
me. His smile fled like a shadow. “Wantee
warsliin’, sir?” he said gravely and obse-
quiously to the back of the guest going
doing the hall.
But it is not often the ’l.oo gives you a
chance like that; mostly there is a heavy
veil over the watchful eyes. You will have
noticed that as the day fades into evening,
groups of three or four young men, cold,
definite, prosperous young men, gather out-
side the corner pubs. They remain some-
times in the summer long after the pub has
closed. A motor comes by at dusk, whose
driver shakes his head; and the group dis-
perses. Or the driver stops, and one to
whom he nods gets into the car, the rest
drifting away. The car makes two or three
more stops; and goes out to Surry Hills
or to the Australia, or to the Rocks. It is
the Twentieth Century push gathering, firm
and resolute, for the night’s work.
The driver of the car sometimes disap-
pears for a time, long or short, according
to his sentence or the length of his holiday
in Monte Carlo or Paris. His place is
taken by another, and the work goes on.
The man in the car lasts longer than the
others who wait for him ; these change often
in person, but hardly at all in type. They
are cold and self-possessed, well but not too
well dressed, never drunk or out of control,
but too distinguished—the sort of man who
would be sure to get and lose the job he
wanted. On rainy nights the “foreman”
sometimes has a job for all of them.
Those who have trimmed the motley per-
manently keep the shops; not the food
shops—as elsewhere in the world, these are
plutocrats. But the little jumbles that can
be stocked for the £2O which was the dead
husband’s insurance money, or the compen-
sation, or the salvage of. the motley. These
are the salt of the earth. If they know
anything of my Chinaman or of the young
men waiting at the corner for the foreman,
they keep it jealously to themselves. And
not always for policy; all the old rules
are boiled down to the first and last real
one: “Live and let live.” Children’s clothes
they sell, and rag dolls, vegetables and eggs,
fruit, knitting-needles, toys beginning and
.ending at 3d. —anything which can be home-
made or stocked on the smallest capital.
They are not talkative. We get along very
well", thank you; there is always enough and
a little over, and there are the Sundays.
Perhaps there is not much ahead; but who
has that? Or, having it, sleeps the better
for it?
The theat’icals float in and out with the
engagements that come and go. As things
improve, they go up to Darlinghurst. Later,
they come back to the ’Loo, which is good
for"them, as it was for me; you have some
chance of keeping your sense of proportion
that way. The drunks, the cleaners and
“occasionals” are permanencies with whom
the ’Loo has no quarrel. These are things
which might happen to anybody; in the
face of realities, they are unimportant things.
Besides, every one must live —presumably.
Speaking selfishly, I love the place. If
pens, ink and paper have become the whole
make-up for you, here are types shorn bare
of superficies, types that you can put upon
your paper direct, with a change only of
names. In every house there is a story;
down every street a tragedy may go any day.
and a comedy does go every day. You need
take no characters or yarns to trim and
modify; everything is here for you. raw
and real and complete. The color and deli-
cate thought that are not in our victories
and our endless fight are in the quiet old
streets where shy houses stand behind black
cypresses; or where, at the top end, some
large houses, not quite free of the tinsel,
hide in their dark gardens. These are not
the ’Loo; they hang on the shabby fringe of
bygone days; and God knows we want little
of the past to remember in the ’Loo.
That man-hunt is a difficult thing to
explain, I know; it is too near elemental
reality. A crowd of men beating through
the night with no word spoken. Their foot-
steps coming gently on the silence at first,
swelling to the wild battering rush past
your window, and fading again into the
silence and the dark, with no word spoken.
That is too close to the heart of things, even
in the ’Loo. Still, it is a rare thing; and
no one is sinless. _
FRANCIS BRIEN.

“A.J.S.”: Visited the dentist’s lately, and
in the street outside the rooms saw an
agonised stranger expectorating blood into
the gutter'. “Holloa, mate,” I ventured
kindly, “been haying a tooth out?” “No,”
was the weary reply, “I’m doing this for
a advertisement.”
“Arthur R.”: Webster’s Post Office
recently handled a letter bearing the enig-
matical address “Sheaf Blice.” The car-
riers tossed to see whether they should try
it at Chinatown or down at the Indian
camp, but finally delivered it to the correct
address, “Chief of Police.”
“All’s Well”: For a spinster actress the
press may be made to serve as matrimonial
agent. She announces her engagement to a
mysterious stranger, whereupon all the
bachelors of her acquaintance show their
hands, and she allows the most desirable of
her possible husbands to have the joy of
supplanting the non-existent stranger in her
affections.
“ Jeune Premier”: During the recent mum-
mers’ strike in New York an organisation
was hurriedly formed, under the patronage
of the managers, in opposition to the Actors’
Equity Association, which the bosses swore
they would never recognise. This new body
was called the Actors’ Fidelity Association.
Its members are now known all through the
States as the Fidos.
“Stargazer”: The first night of a great
Australian play was on at a Sydney theatre.
The talented young author, after taking fear-
ful glances through two acts, fled in despair.
A friend found him in a neighboring bar,
looking like a man who had killed his aunt
and was in horrified expectation of the worst.
The friend led him back to the theatre. As
they approached, a woman in a faint was
being carried forth. The night; was excep-
tionally hot, and the theatre was intolerably
crowded; but the author groaned as the hap-
less female was borne past. Upstairs they
sat in the crush room, and presently, one
on the heels of the other, two more victims
of heat and bad air were helped out. Then
the depressed author jumped up with a
glint in his eye. “By ——!” he said, “they’ve
had it out with the actors. What if they
recognise me?” And he fled again.
“McNorth” on the white man’s burden :
I was drifting down a lazy tide in the Louisiade
Archipelago when a canoe put off from a village a
mile or so abeam. Its single occupant dropped his
paddle as he approached, and, standing upright,
waved a piece of paper and pointed back towards
the village, while the sound of natives wailing iri
Chorus floated across the sunlit sea. I signalled the
man to come alongside and presently I was decipher-
ing a heterogeneous collection of bCche-de-mer Eng-
lish and stilted native phrases written on the back
of a tinned-milk label. It was from the Raratongan
trader stationed on the island and was to the effect
that his wife was in a very bad way indeed. Things
had not gone at all as usual. The husband’s heart
was sore; lie was demented with grief. He en-
treated the Heaven-sent white man, whose presence
he had detected aboard the lugger, to come ashore
and help the woman, who otherwise would surely
die. Was it not known that all white men were
doctors? I got into the canoe and, as the uncertain
craft headed back to the beach, took a 20-minute
course in obstetrics from the only medical book in
my possession. The Raratongan met me on the
beach, his face drawn with anxiety, his hands
trembling as they reached for mine. He led me
through the cocoanuts to the native-built “station"
and I gave him the job of silencing the crowd wailing-
on the verandah. Then, in the quiet that was broken
only by the screams of a woman in agony, I did what
I could out of the depths of my abysmal ignorance.
There were no instruments save a sheath-knife, no
anaesthetics save rum, no antiseptics at all; but
luck and a healthy body stood that woman in good
stead, and soon I was able to report to the man
hovering in the doorway: “Both well.”
“Silas” : “I saw the house liadvertised in
the paper,” said the washer-lady, “and I
bustled down to the agent’s place first thing
and gets next the door. Afore the bloke
come and opened up there’s 15 of us. and
we rushes the counter, and has a lively
time, I promise you.; but I sticks, to it. I
was first on the job, and the agent acts
honest and gives me the key, and off I goes
with the crowd, now about 20, tailin’ after
in case the place don’t suit me. Well, it
don’t, far from it. I might have stood the
back fence all down, and half the kids of
creation in the yard, and I might have over-
looked the broke winders, ten of ’em, but
when the rats come up through the floor,
no good to me. Others wants the key ; but
if I don’t return it I don’t get me shillin’
back, so away we troops ag’in. At the
agent’s place there’s a dozen more waitin’
to see about the ’ouse, and Brock and a
feller with red warts is havin’ a fight,
and two women is slappin’ each other’s faces
who’s to have the key. Brock got it, I
heard, by offerin’ a shillin’ a week more
rent. It’s just the place what’ll suit him.”
After a silence I ventured to” ask why the
place would suit Mr. Brock. “Oh,” Mrs.
Suds replied, ‘‘he grows rats to sell to the
munercipple council.”
“Sphincter” supplies an answer:—
“Why do doctors make such a poor showing in
English literature?” “Zanthus” asked (B. 2/10/’l9).
Having eliminated Sir Thomas Browne, Smollett,
Oliver Wendell Holmes and William James, he finds
only Conan Doyle left. For my part I can add
. but one other name to the list: the present poet-
laureate, Robert Bridges, was a. doctor, and held
hospital appointments until his retirement in 1882.
The reason for the poverty of the list is that the
intellectual status of the medical profession is, on
the whole, low. The average practitioner is but
one or two steps removed from his prehistoric pro-
totype, with his aromatic mixtures and his holy
water. A hundred or so, doctors, according to F.
H. Hayward (“Professionalism, and Originality”),
with exceptional diagnostic or surgical skill, con-
stitute the living nucleus of their professions. The
rest are ordinary men not a degree higher than the
average mill-hand or grocer. The explanation is
not far to seek ; it is in the medical student. And
he cannot be blamed entirely for what he is. There
are obvious defects in his education. He is ex-
pected to traverse the whole science of medicine
and surgery in five years; and much that the
curriculum imposes on him is redundant or use-
less. As a rule, he finds it impossible to do all
the work conscientiously. He resorts to compro-
mise: crowds his brain with incomprehensible
memoranda, formula; and mnemonic absurdities.
Under such regime his intellect, ossifies. He. begins
to lose any clarity of vision or originality be-
queathed to him; and having no time for extensive
reading or artistic culture, he eschews literature
for the nonsense novel, and music for the jingle
of the vaudeville.

When your stomach’s upset
Your meals do not digest—your
stomach feels over-loaded you
have heartburn and headaches—
When you bolch up gas and
undigested food—
Then is the time to start taking
Chamberlain’s Tablets for the
stomach and liver.
They are great for upset stomachs
and will soon put you right side
up again.
Thousands enjoy good health
because they were persuaded to take
Chamberlain’s Tablets when their
stomachs were weak and livers
disordered.
Get a bottle to-day. Let them
demonstrate their power to relieve
disorders of the stomach and liver.
Take them regularly until your
stomach is in order again. Then
take one occasionally to keep your-
self in good health. You can always
keep your stomach clean and healthy
by an occasional dose of

Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when ‘his remedy is at hand all danger
Eft ay be avoided.
Ce Firm.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

The Queen’s Conscience.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TALKIN’ o’ fowls, did you ever hear
about ol’ Joe Manson an’ his black
orpin’ton? No? Well, ol’ Joe wuz
a cocky at a li’le place called Johnson’s
Flat, an’ the one pleasure he got out of
life he got from about a hundred chooks. He
neglected his li’le dust-hole of a selection for
them fowls, an’ if he’d been married he'd
have neglected his fambly, too.
Bein’ not married on’y seemed to make
him more set on ’em, an’ I’ve heard him
brag about a noo clutch of chickens more
than a married man does about twins. He’d
learned a wonnerful lot about ’em. He
used to stan’ in the hen-yard for hours and
hours lookin’ at ’em as they scratched and
fluffed in the dust. All kinds they was.
He’d orpin’tons and leghorns by the dozen,
but the pride of them all wuz a fat ol’ black
orpin’ton he use to call Queen O’Malley.
She wuz the mother of half the famblies in
the yard, and wuz so tame she’d let ol’
Joe pick her up an’ show her roun’ with-
out battin’ a feather. He said she’d never
missed layin’ one egg a day since she wuz
a pullet, w’ich must er been somew’cres
about the time Cap’n Cook landed. Reg’lar
as clockwork she was. Every mornin’
somew’eres about 11 she’d waddle off to her
nest an’ lay an egg, and then she’d knock off
for the rest of the day. She never once
missed w’ile I knew her. 1 remember once
when ol’ Joe got an idear into his head that
the roosters used ter crow to make the hens
lay. He said he was dead sure that chooks
was fond of music, and that the roosters was
only crowin’ to cheer ’em up. So he bought
an accordecn, an’ one mornin’ went out to
the yard and started to play to ’em. He
on’y played for about five minutes, but he’d
given them chooks such a .scare that they
started to moult, and they all stopped layin’
excep’ poor ol’ Queen O’Malley. She never
seemed to take no notice of what wuz goin’
on round her. She did what she considered
to be her duty, and there she stopped. She
wuz a very conscientious bird.
By and bye Joe begun to worry about the
Queen. He said she oughter consider him a
bit. He thought that w’en a bird had such
good treatment as she got that it’d be on’y
fair for her to work a bit harder, to encour-
age the young pullets. One egg a day wuz
all right for a common bird, but he thought
she should try an’ raise herself above the
mass. But the Queen kept on doin’ her
steady one per day, and no more.
At last ol’ Joe got to scheming out some
way to increase her output. He left off
workin’ on the farm at all, an’ he’d sit
out in the yard watchin’ her scratchin’ an’
try to entice her into her nest again. Then
he got an’ idear. He set to work on one
of the big hen-houses an’ lined it inside with
hessian. Then he got a pot of tar and tar-
red the hessian, and w’en it wuz all done
he went in an’ shut the door, and w’erever
he saw a spot of light he filled the crack
up with tar. Bimeby he got that shed as
dark as it could be —not a spot of light
anyw’eres. He lost himself in it once, and
wuz about an hour findin’ the door again.
Then he put a snug nest in one corner, an’
hung a hurricane-lamp on the wall. W’en
it wuz all ready he caught ol’ Queen O’Mal-
ley and shoved her inside, and then he lit
the lamp an’ went away.
Well, he waited jus’ twelve hours, and
then went an’ had a look in at her. She
seemed quite happy, and wuz cluckin’ and
scratchin’ away, an’ he almost fainted w’en
he seen she’d laid an egg in the nest. He
took it, then he blew out the lamp, an’
could hear her goin’ to roost as usual. He
went away, and come back in another twelve
hours, and she climbed off her perch and
started in quite ca'mlv. She must er thought
that the lamplight wuz the day, and so she
didn’t alter her programme at all.
This knocked Joe. He lef’ the other fowls
alone, an’ spent all his time hangin’ round
Queen O’Malley’s shed.
At last he got so sick er waitin’ that he
begun to cut down the time between lamp-
light and dark. It made no difference to
the Queen. If she thought she wuz bein’
hard-pushed she never mentioned it, and
kept pluggin’ awav. Bimebv Joe’d on’y give
her about, ten minutes’ light, then five, an’
at last she got so that w’enever the lamp
wuz lit she’d go straight over an’ lay her
egg, an’ then climb back and go to sleep.
She never missed, and no matter how often
he went to her shed she was always ready
for him.
At last things got so it useter be a kind
a race between them. Ol’ Joe’d flash the
light in the door, and the Queen’d sprint
over to her nest an’ lay an egg as quick
as winkin’. Towards the end she got into
the way of sleepin’ on the nest, so as not
to lose any time w’en the light came. One
flash, and the egg’d be laid.
It’d been very sultry all day, and towards
night the clouds begun to bank up and
thunder to growl over in the hills. Thei’o
was a pretty strong wind, too, and w’en
night come it wuz as black as your hat.
and windy enough to blow your hair off.
The’ wuz a mob of us over at ol’ Joe’s, an’
he was sittin’ there as proud as Punch,
tellin’ us about his new system that wuz
goin’ to make him famous, w’en all of a
sudden there comes a crash from over at
the fowl-yard. We all runs out, an’ jus’ as
we got to the fowl-yard gate there comes a
reg’lar sluice of lightning. We see then
that the roof wuz blown off the Queen’s
house, and. we all runs across and looks in.
Joe lit the lamp after some trouble, and we
seen poor ol’ Queen O’Malley lyin’ dead on
her nest. It broke poor ol’ Joe up completely.
He never got over it.
No, it wasn’t the lightnin’—the lightnin’
never so much as singed her. What killed
poor ol' Queen O’Malley wuz too much con-
science. She tried to lay an egg before the
lightnin’ went out. an’ the effort killed her.

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Wart”: In the days when I earned a
crust as a jeweller and silversmith I used to
bang to pieces an imported boxwood mallet
in twelve months. One day a boat-builder
offered to make me one of Tasmanian black-
wood. After five years’ belting it was still
a good mallet, with apparently another five
years’ wear in front of it.
“Araminta”: I’m going to support the
party which will promise that in future
sugar is to be retailed by butchers or mil-
liners or anybody who doesn’t stock or have
any interest in the sale of jam. Nothing
will convince me that my grocer, from whom
I have had 21b. of white sugar in the past
two months, keeps me short for any reason
but that he knows me to be the sort of
person ready to prepare a little boiling of
home-made jam on the slightest provocation.
Jam in tins, with the stalks, pips and
feathers included, is not popular with me
when it reaches Sd. and 9d. per lb.
“75” : The Song of the Shirt is sung in
Melbourne nowadays to an obligato pro-
vided by the rattle of teacups. Clothing fac-
tories are finding it so difficult to obtain
girls at £3 a week, in competition with fluff
emporiums which offer 30s. and a certificate
of gentility, that morning and midday tea
and other inducements are offered to lure
Ermyntrude from the ribbon counter and
cream-puff mausoleum. One firm is tendering
a fortnight's holiday on full pay to every
damsel who completes a year of service, and
if Evangeline still remains coy a violet-
powder gratuity will probably be added.
* * * *
“II.P.”: I recently submitted to the
P.M.G. this suggestion for an improvement
in postal-notes—that the p.n. be printed
with a detachable butt, the latter to have
th 6 number and denomination of the note
printed thereon, space for issuing-office date-
stamp and a couple of lines for the sender
to record the name of the sendee. It seemed
to me that this slip, when detached, would
be a handy record for the sender. The
P.M.G. himself promptly replied that my
suggestion “would be of no value to the
Department, and of very little value to the
bulk of those who use postal-notes.” I
differ. What do Bulletin readers think 7
* * * *
“Zanthus” : Work has been started on the
foundations of the great dam on the Murray
River, just below its junction with the Mitta
Mitta, which is to be the main reservoir for
Murray irrigation. When it is finished the
lake above the dam is to be 30 miles long
and hold 1,000,000 acre-feet of water, or
enough to cover a million acres a foot deep.
It will be the fifth-biggest in the world, the
four ahead of it being the Assouan on the
Nile, and the Elephant Butte and two others
in IT.S.A. At present Burrinjuck (7G8.000
acre-feet) is Australia’s biggest pond, but
when the plans for the dam at the Sugar-
loaf, on the Goulburn River (Vic.), are
carried out in full, that one will hold back
918.000 acre-feet of water. The weight of
1,000,000 ac»e-feet of water is just about
1,200,000,000 tons.
“Billy B.” : A barrel of beer has its artistic
personality ; a chariot loaded with the happy
and abounding casks deserves the approba-
tion of honest men ; but who has known an
honest, orderly man who does not hunger to
drown in his own froth the brewer who sends
his carters out in the noonday to hold up
the traffic of the pavements? Any morning
in Sydney one is forced aside from a hundred
footways by jowled men engaged in rolling
into pub-cellars interminable hogsheads. This
morning at Circular Quay, on a corner where
the tram traffic is always dangerous, a fine,
brightly-dressed young mother, with her two
toddlers, was blocked by the beer-gangway to
the cellar, and (leaving the traffic risks
aside) had to puddle behind a water-cart on
the carriage-track. Can’t the damned beer
balloons be floated out of the way in the
city’s apology for night?
* * # *
“B.B.”: Out of Broome (W.A.) another
big pearl has been sold —£4000. It weighed
40 grains. Last week I saw four pearls
from Torres Strait. One, a perfect sphere—
or so I judged it as it lay in an old wadded
tobacco tin—-was sold to a Melbourne man.
The price was not plastered on the bill-
board, but if you take a long breath it’s
about that much. Talking of high prices for
pearls—and, of course, pearls being play-
things, you pay as your fancy or whoever
she is dictates —the yarn goes among the
divers that the “Star of the West,” a beauty
collected up in the nor’-west water of Aus-
tralia, was sold for £25,000. It may be
true. I know a man who has seen the Mos-
cow pearl—“La Pellegrina.” It is credited
to be the most perfect of all known pearls.
It weighs 28 carats, I think. Perhaps Lenin
or Trotsky is wearing it for a shirt-button
these days.
“Broker” : Australian whisky, chiefly Vic-
torian, which until a year ago was regarded
as very poor tipple, is rapidly coming into
its own. Flavor and quality have markedly
improved, and the shortage of British sup-
plies has given it a great push. The 1918-0
Scotch distilling season is over, but de-
pleted stocks, curtailed production, war re-
strictions still in force and a shortage of
cereal crops provide a poor outlook. Barley
has rapidly advanced from 70s. to 100 s. a
quarter, and whisky magnates find decora-
tions for the enforced patriotism of handing
over premises for munition work a bad
substitute for vanished stocks. American
and Canadian supplies have never found a
popular outside market anywhere, and Aus-
tralia’s local product, despised a few years
ago, is now being eagerly snapped up for
British and foreign consumption. Two re-
cent shipments valued at about £14,U00 were
sent to London and India respectively.
# # * *
“Copy Boy”: Included in the new Health
Bill of the Lawson Government is a clause
to prohibit Australian wines being sold in
Victoria under names which include Euro-
pean regional appellations. A recent inter-
national convention prohibits the importation
into Great Britain of Australian wines bear-
ing such names, so that our grape-juice is
now sold in Bull’s country as “Australian
red” or “Australian white” wine. Lawson
seeks to prohibit the sale in Victoria of
champagne, port, sherry, etc., under their
correct names, even with the word “Aus-
tralian” in front. But “champagne,” in
addition to being the name of a district in
France, is the name of a wine known all
over the world, and any wine made from
stocks originally imported from that district,
and given similar treatment, is entitled to be
known by the name. As long as the word
“Australian” is used as a prefix there can be
no question of deception. Why not also pro-
hibit the use of such terms as “Clydesdale”
horses, “Algerian” oats and “Cape” barley
when these articles are produced in Aus-
tralia ?
“Murkah”: Though not as efficient as
could be wished, Australia’s telegraph ser-
vice compares very well with that of some
other countries —for instance, the U.S. The
States have no double-rate urgent system, so
that, in theory, all telegrams take their turn.
But wires lodged by good customers, big
business firms, etc., are marked “rush” by
the counter clerk, and thereafter receive pre-
cisely the same treatment as our “urgent”
traffic. Such telegrams take an hour and
a half (average) from New York to San
Francisco. An urgent from Perth to Bris-
bane (a fair enough comparison) takes about
the same time. I don’t altogether believe in
the urgent system by which the wealthy
man’s golf-scores get priority over the poor
man’s death message ; but in Australia the
urgency has at least to be paid for—loo per
cent, extra. In effect, the Yankee telegraph
cos. adopt a sliding scale —the bigger the
customer the better the service. A dissatis-
fied firm can transfer its business to another
telegraph co., hence the special treatment.
For all kinds of ordinary telegrams, however,
the Yankee service is not within hours of
Australian performance. Regarding rates
there is simply no comparison. The mini-
mum charge for a wire from San Francisco
to New York is Os. 3d., covering 10 words,
address not counted. Extra words cost sd.
each. In any one State of the Union the
minimum is, as a rule, Is. 3d. P Is. Od.
* * * *
“Kuro Kuro” : Another industry could be
developed successfully in Papua by the util-
isation of the immense tracts of waste land
upon which that bane of the planter, lalang
grass, grows so luxuriantly. Lalang is the
common blady grass, the curse of the tropical
agriculturist throughout the Malay States,
Borneo, Papua and Queensland. Campbell,
of Cairns, has used the weed for the manu-
facture of paper-pulp, and the article made
from this base has proved of excellent quality.
The world’s supply of timber suitable
for paper-manufacture is shrinking at an
alarming rate ; and prices go up accordingly.
With lalang, however, the crop soon renews
itself. Three tons of grass gives one ton of
pulp ; an acre of land grows about 10 tons
of grass; and first-quality pulp should fetch
fS a ton. Thousands of acres covered with
lalang are on the coast of Papua, and there
is labor available for the cutting and a har-
bor to accommodate deep-water ships is right
on the spot.
THE PARSON’S LIVING WAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The parson pure must ofttimes think
Of other things than prayer and praise;
The rising cost of food and drink
Diverts from them his mental gaze,
Whene’er he mentions daily bread,
Or corn and oil; and oh, alas!
With hungry children to be fed,
He wishes that all flesh were grass.
An actor on a holy stage,
lie cannot earn a living wage.
If flesh were grass, at early dawn
He’d rise, and, with a thankful smile,
Would mow the little bit of lawn
That fronts his humble domicile;
A tasty fry, or stew, or grill
His willing labor would provide:
And presently, by Heaven’s will,
llis loved ones would be satisfied.
But now, their yearnings to assuage,
The parson lacks a living wage.
False mummers who in drama rave,
To slow orchestral music’s strain,
Of death, and hope beyond the grave,
Vehemently of Fate complain;
Those frauds their anger can express
In language turgid and absurd,
Whilst parsons, feigning gentleness,
Must eloeute the Blessed Word.
They may not, in fine frenzied rage,
Demand a decent living wage.
The worker, heedless of his soul,
Can be a rebel when he likes,
And, voting Labor at the poll,
Attain his end by selfish strikes.
The parson, who would chuck his job
Could he but find a better one,
Can only choke a rising sob,
And murmur, “Lord, Thy will be done.”
He reads the Scriptures; ne’er a page
Prescribes for him a living wage.
A plump archbishop (this is odd)
Strolls proudly through his palace grounds ;
His Grace’s “screw” for serving God
Is, maybe, twenty thousand pounds.
His luncheons arc delicious snacks;
His cellar stocked with aged wine;
Despite his heavy income tax,
He is a well-to-do divine.
By how he lives we sinners gauge
A common parson’s living wage.
“Sell all thou hast,” archbishop dear,
And share it with your brethren poor,
Who get not quite enough a year
To keep the spectre from the door—
The grim, accursed Hunger wraith,
Whereof smug politicians speak ;
They all profess the Christian faith,
Yet care not for its teachers meek.
O wily Hughes, or Ryan sage,
Why not a parsons’ living wage?

COCOANUT OIL MAKES
an ELEGANT HAIR WASH.
Girls and women who wish to keep their
hair in nice condition should be most cautious
in the soap they wash it with. Most
soaps and ready-mixed shampoos contain
excessive quantities of alkali. This dries
the scalp, makes the hair brittle and is very
injurious. Just ordinary colinated cocoanut
oil (a pure, saponified but quite greaseless
liquid) is far better than the most costly
soap you could possibly use for a shampoo,
for this cannot possibly hurt your hair.
Merely wet your hair with water and rub it
on. A couple of teaspoonsful make a perfect
flood of rich, thick, creamy lather, and
cleanses both hair and scalp thoroughly. The
lather rinses out easily, and takes with it
every trace of dust, dirt, dandruff or excessive
oiliness. The hair dries quickly and evenly,
and comes out fine and silky, bright, glossy
and fluffy, appearing to be heavier than it is.
And best of all this colinated cocoanut oil
leaves the hair as easy to dress again as
though you hadn’t washed it at all. You can
get- colinated cocoanut oil at most any chemist,
but be sure it’s “colinated,” which is not
expensive—a few ounces lasting a long, long
time.
Girls! Women! Give this a Corner on your Dressing-
table. Never Let a Corn Ache Again!
i
Like a Flash!- Few Drops Stop Corns Throbbing,
Then Corns and Callouses Wither Up, Loosen
and Lift Out Like a Cork—Painlessly!
VCS
THE Australian people owe a
debt of gratitude to the wizard
in chemistry who formulated the
new ether discovery named
Frozol-Ice.
Little phials of this
wonder liquid are now
obtainable from any chem-
ist for a few pence. You
merely apply a few drops
of this Frozol-Ice on a ten-
der, aching corn or tough-
ened callous. Right away all
soreness vanishes, and soon you see the
oorn or callous that loose and withered
that it lifts out with the fingers, like a
cork. Not a twinge of pain or even irritation
is felt when using Frozol-Ice, or afterwards.
No soreness, no inflammation of surrounding
liealthy flesh or skin.
Only a few pence now gives one freedom

If Favorite Foods
Upset Stomach
Take Magnesia.
If some of the foods you like best do not
agree with you and make your stomach sour
or burn, producing acid indigestion, do not
think you must give up eating these good
things, and do not, either, make the mistake
of swallowing pepsin pills or sodawater after
every meal. Instead, just make a practice of
taking a teaspoonful of pure Salix Magnesia
in half a glass of hot water right after eating.
The hot water will force a needed blood
supply to your stomach, and the Salix Mag-
nesia will instantly neutralise any excess of
stomach acid, and your digestion will be
natural and painless. Salix Magnesia is not a
laxative, and its continued use is entirely
harmless, as it never weakens natural diges-
tion. It can be obtained at any well-stocked
chemist’s shop. Be sure to get Salix Magnesia.
Do not use other forms of magnesia for this
purpose.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
<t T WONDER how a self-respectin’ navy
ever allowed any swivel-chair brass-
hat to append that disgustin’- air-cater-
pillar to its fixin’s,” remarked the senior
snotty, pointing with the stem of his pipe
through the port in the general direction of
a yellow object like a pinhole in the sky,
showing far off over- what appeared to be
an otherwise unoccupied sea.
“You don’t know everything,” remarked
the sunny-haired boy. “So keep your bear-
ings cool and tell uncle if you hate admirals.”
“Admirals!” said the senior snotty, who
had been patiently holding the benedietine
bottle inverted over his coffee cup in the
vain hope of one more drip. “Of course I
hate ’erti; I hnte ’em gentlemanly, but I hate
’em. That’s what I think of admirals,” he
continued, casting the bottle forth into the
sea. “But what have they to do with the
uuhatched butterfly over there?”
“That balloon was the result of an admiral
playing merry-go-round on the high seas to
the detriment of the promotions and general
prospects of six perfectly good officers and
a boatful of useful ratings,” said the sunny-
haired boy. “Like to hear the yarn?”
We were sitting round the mess table after
tiffin, and the object under discussion was
one of the elongated observation balloons
which were towed about the sky by certain
of his 'Majesty’s ships for the purpose of
spotting submarines at a distance. We were
too comfy to re-organise ourselves into the
usual chess and bridge parties, and here was
an enterprising youth with a yarn; so he
was requested to do his worst. And he held
forth.
“The business began years ago in France,
where a society of enthusiastic maniacs was
formed for flying kites. They used to trot
round on Sundays, fat men and little boys
and all, towing all sorts of paraphernalia at
the end of pieces of string. Some —-the
little boys, encouraged by the fat men—used
to sit in the things and. get carried up. At
that time there was a rumpus on between the
French forces in Africa and the sons of
Allah, and the only balloon they had was
the old round type known as ‘the pill.’ This
used to bob about outrageously in the desert
winds, and the observer spent most of the
Government’s valuable time decanting his in-
nards ; for being sea-sick is a heaven-sent
blessing compared to being balloon-sick.
“The kite society heard of these difficulties,
and in one mighty brain-wave decided that
here was its chance to get a white and green
ribbon to wear on its pyjamas. For if wind
was what made the balloon come down, was
it not the very thing to make kites go up?
“Then the natural course of history led
me into the war with the Hun.
“The part the Admiral and me were per-
spirin’ over was the U-boats. To see them it
was a case of the higher the sooner and the
quicker the better, so to speak. So we called
for contributions as to the best means of hav-
ing one foot on the ship and one in the
clouds, so as to see as far as possible, the
top of the masts being about four hundred
yards too near sea-level. Of all the plans
that were suggested, all were eliminated
save two. One was the balloon you see out
there and the other was a highly improved
kite designed in France by the society of
enthusiasts aforesaid. And the balloon was
set aside for later consideration owing to
it’s unladylike behavior in the wind that
was raised by anything travelling twenty
knots at sea.
“It happened that I was chosen to go to
France to gather all useful data re kites for
purposes of observation in the Navy.
“The kites were shaped somewhat like an
aeroplane, constructed of bamboo and rub-
berised silk. One of them was attached to
the end of a light steel cable, at certain
distances along which were metallic knobs
of progressively larger size. If the first
kite held and the wind was sufficiently
steady, a second one was fixed on to the cable
at the winch end and it ran up until it was
stopped by a bigger knob. A third and
fourth kite were sent up in the same way—
and so on till the tension of the cable was
found to be sufficient to carry up her load.
The winch then wound in the cable, bring-
ing the train of kites to about fifty yards
from the ground, the basket with the ob-
server on board was hooked on and the
whole concern let out as high as it would
go.
“I tried it several times and it was not the
hair-raising circus you might expect, for if
the wind slacked off the winch crew would
haul in fast, thus creating a breeze sufficient
to maintain the concern in equilibrium till
the basket reached the ground. And even
if one began to fall, the speed of the fall
would create a wind that kept the kites
pulling.
“I got quite keen about the stunt, and
carried off the whole show with me to give
it a few trials at sea. The kites held so
well on the sea-breeze that I went on
shore with the French officer who ran the
show, and over a bowl of those miniature
strawberries soaked in champagne that one
gets in Bordeaux I composed a report so
scintillating upon the possibilities of kites
as a means of scuppering IJ-boats that I’m
damned if the Old Man didn’t decide to give
the show the benefit of his personal attention.
“The French Government sent a destroyer
along, and while her chief set what he called
his ‘Zebras’ to cleanin’ up the paint-work
and polishin’ the ship’s clock and gettin’
the rum and sardines up into the boudoir,
me and the kite crew got the cable wound
round the drum of a donkey engine they’d
rigged and saw that everything was work-
ing comfy.
“Suddenly someone ejaculated a remark in
French, all the ‘Zebras’ dispersed to hide
the soap and gold paint among the camou-
flage, then stood in a row at attention and
the Admiral came aboard. After the usual
pow-wow and sealing of the entente cordiale,
we took him to the stern, and while the ship
put out to sea we rigged the kites and let
’em up. It was a beautiful day, with an
eighteen-mile breeze above the five hundred-
yard limit and those kites floated up till we
were fairly burstin’ with happiness, and the
Old Man started telling stories in what he
believed to be French. I felt that my des-
tiny led direct to an early promotion, and that
if I could only induce him to go up and see
for himself how distinctly everything showed
up for miles the thing would be done.
,“It proved quite easy. The Admiral was
keen to go up. So we hauled down the kite
train, hooked on the basket, and up he went,
the destroyer loafing along at about 20 revo-
lutions, just to keep on the run. We had a
telephone up to the Old Man. and he
kept on ejaculatin’ ecstasies, and. forgetting
we couldn’t see as far as he could, was ask-
ing what that and that was over there, and
criticisin’ the evolutions of some blighter on
the horizon who evidently didn’t know there
was an admiral loose among the clouds.
“After nearly an hour he issued instruc-
tions requisite to coming down. These being
transferred along the usual channels the
winch started to wind in the cable. All of
a sudden there was a terrific row of escaping
steam, and a bald and unconvincing watch-
officer rushed up to say that it would be
nothing—a supply-pipe had burst and would
be repaired queek. The winch ceased to
function, and the Old Man began simul-
taneously to semaphore : ‘Please explain.’
This was hectic enough, but to add to the
general joyfulness the wind began to fail.
The lookout drew our attention respectfully
to the uppermost kite, which was beginning
to wobble. The Admiral also drew our atten-
tion to it per telephone, but not respectfully.
Before we had time to soothe his ruffled
spirit the whole train of kites began to swim
about and the basket to descend.
“Talk about a merry beehive let loose!
We had those ‘Zebras’ working on that
steam-pipe like blazes. We tried also to
wind the cable in by hand. But it was all
no use. Those French kites were bent on
ducking an English admiral who was not
keen to be ducked. In fact, even over and
above the noise of the repair gang we could
hear him saying his prayers, navy fashion,
and they included me.
“Fortunately the blighter on (lie bridge con-
tained brains. lie waggled his telegraph
down to the engine-room. That destroyer
could travel when she put her mind to it,
and pretty soon we were covering 38 knots.
The cable was pulled tight, and up soared
the Ad., graceful as a bird, navigating the
clouds in a roaring gale.
“But we could not keep on in a straight
line. At that rate we should pretty soon
have got out among the minefields and Ü-
boats and other advantages of the state of
war, and we could not stop without ducking
the Old Man. So we started tearing round
and round in circles. As an exhibition of
steering it was top-hole. All the loose ship-
ping for miles around came to look on.
Headquarters semaphored demanding ex-
planations. But round we went, leaving a
trail of soapy green sea like a race-track,
and leaning outward so that the ‘Zebras’
perspirin’ over that steam-pipe had to hook
on to anything solid with one hand and work
with the' other.
“Number One on the destroyer was having
his attention distracted from its rightful
course by listening to the strings of won-
drous French pouring through the telephone.
He kept muttering ‘C’est magnifique! C’est
mcrveilleux!' Some of the ships were curs-
ing us because they wanted to get past and
didn’t dare make a rush for it. Some were
cheering us on, and altogether we were
having a day out. Finally, after 68 minutes,
during which we must have done a good 50
laps round the bay, the winch began to gee
and the Old Man was hauled in. He was
pink in the face, although he had lapsed
into silence out of consideration, no doubt,
for the entente cordiale. But I could feel
that lie was still peevish. And (it just
shows how a man allows himself to be
misled by prejudice) I was returned to Eng-
land that night without thanks, and kites
were pigeon-holed in favor of balloons.
“Thus was the Navy condemned to tow
the gasbags behind it for the rest of its days,
and thus was my career nipped, and all
through a blinkin’ steam-pipe.”
G. M. CRIVELLI.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Not every Anzac was a deathless hero.
Cyril Snapford was a case in point.
As a matter of fact he did not
actually land on Anzac. He never saw
it. He arrived at Suez with the Oomtli
Reinforcements of the Umpth D.A.C. in Sep-
tember, 1915, which gave him, ultimately, the
technical right to wear the brass “A on his
color patch, to sport a ribbon undistinguish-
able from that earned by the men who fought
at Mons and Lone Pine, and to talk of
Colonel Murray, V.C., by liis < Christian name.
I met him first in the be£,! ming of 1916.
•We werfe on the day train from Luxor, which
in those times, after plodding f. r many weary
hours through the irrigated ri.l bisli-tip that
is Egypt, trailed into Cairo at about 9 p.m.
He was talking to a confessedly eminent
American journalist, and they presently ad-
mitted me to their conversation. The dis-
cussion revolved around Fear, and one of
them asked if there was any occasion on
which I remembered experiencing it with
paralysing intensity. I said truthfully that
I had felt it many times —at its worst, per-
haps, on being publicly threatened with a
punch on the nose by an inebriated pugilist.
The admission was a mistake. It let down
the tone of the discussion. The American
brought it back to the right level by mention-
ing that h e had known nothing more than
mild excitement, of a rather pleasing kind,
when 5000 Filipinos charged him and a few
friends at Santa Catalona Bay. Cyril had
a subtler method. He recalled an episode
during the landing of the 18-pounders in the
very early days of the Gallipoli epic. “I
was directing operations on the beach,” lie
said, “and, of course, the shell-fire was—well,
not what you’d call bad exactly, but still
enough to make a man take notice. Pre-
sently Johnston —the General, you know —
and Bertie Lloyd, his brigade-major, strolled
up to see how I was getting on. Just at
that minute plump comes a six-inch almost
on top of us. When the sand and debris
had settled down I heard Johnston say to
Bertie: “That’s young Snapford, isn’t it?”
“Yes,” says Bert. “Well, make a note of
his name. Keep him in mind. Damme, he
didn’t even duck! Laugh! I could ha’
died! As I said to my sar’-major after they
had gone, ‘Why should a man duck?’ Poor
chap, he was blow to pieces a few seconds
later.”
Cyril knew all those whose names were
before the public in any capacity ; and many
secret details, mostly of a lurid nature, about
their careers. So did the Yank. For hours
the reputations of well-known persons w T ere
bandied about.
“I met that young Dook o’ Mumford at
Johnny Maxwell’s dinner the other night,”
said the journalist. “I wuz able to give him
some tips about li’l’ ol’ Noo Yark. Of course
he’s off there after the war.”
“You mean ‘The Barb,’ ” corrected CyriJ
gently. “But, of course, only his intimates
know him as that. I saw a lot of him on
the Peninsula. Poor chap, his drinking
habits were a great handicap to him there.
And then there was that affair about the
women he and his cousin Billy Fitz-Douglas
got over from Lemnos.”
“What,” I interrupted amazedly, “women
on Gallipoli?”
“Certainly,” replied Cyril hardily. “It
was a scandal known to few, and a certain
high authority—no need to mention names —
had it hushed up as far as possible. How-
ever, there were a good many of us in the
know;. The girls had been staying at the
Continental and they got across to Lemnos
as nurses. ‘The Barb’ and Billy had ’em as
batmen on the Peninsula. The thing’d
have gone unnoticed for much longer only
they persisted in using face-pow r der and
manicuring each other’s nails.”
At Shepheard’s that evening we encoun-
tered several of the notorieties who had been
discussed during the day. They took no
notice whatever of my new acquaintances. It
was characteristic of the latter s type that
they were not confounded nor even embai-
rassed. *
1 A few weeks later the D.A.C.’s began to
be broken up and turned into Howitzer bat-
teries. Cyril immediately developed a com-
plaint of long standing—a "knee.” It was
one of those afflictions which have been such
a curse to the bloated capitalist since the
arrival of the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
AH Cyril had to do to get an attack! of
synovitis was to twist his right leg under
him in a certain position and sit on it. lie
went from hospital to a details camp, and
from there to England.
At Camp 200, Lark Hill, Cyril discovered
his chief talent. It was that of a home-
service disciplinarian. The Chevalier de
Grammont remarks in his “Memoirs” that in
Flanders he made a point of reconnoitring
“not the enemy but the generals.” Cyril's
soldiering was on similar lines. As there
were no generals available he reconnoitred
the C. 0., or anyone else of senior rank
who crossed his path. Successful recon-
noitrers are born, not made; and Cyril.was
a king amongst them. It was an inspiring
experience to be one of a little group, with
him, when the C.O. approached. Hack would
go his head ; his heels would crash together;
and a roar of 'Tarty, ’SHOWN !” would rend
the welkin. liis “word of command” was
one of the tinest in the A.I.F. But it was
in the expression of dog-like devotion which
he managed to infuse into his eyes that he
excelled. It said more articulately than any
words: “Here is one worthy not merely of
our veneration but of our love. A great
soldier; but possessing also the god-like at-
tributes of profound human understanding
and kindliness. Worship him—as I do!”
His hand still trembling at his brow from
the violence with which he had dashed it
there, lie would stand, rigid as a lamp-post,
until the great man, much gratified, said
affably: “Carry on, Mr. Snapford ; carry on.”
Whereupon he would partially relax —but
only partially. The ground remained sacred
to the devotee so long as his idol was any-
where in the neighborhood of it.
Cyril became the Camp Q.M. He would
have been the adjutant had this favorite job
not been already filled by one even more
skilled than he was at managing the manage-
ment. As Q.M. he did nothing in particular,
and lived an extremely comfortable and
honorable existence. To friends in England
he explained that the only thing that was
keeping him from France was an appalling
wound which he had received on the Penin-
sula. To relatives at home he wrote that he
was expecting to be off at any moment, and
that it was the disastrous efficiency of his
work which was keeping him from the one
experience for which he yearned—active ser-
vice on the Western front.
In the midst of all this peace and happi-
ness a dreadful thing happened. Cyril’s
C.O. was suddenly returned to Australia. The
new man proved objectionable to the last
degree. He had been eight months on Gal-
lipoli and 17 in France. He had no sym-
pathy with or liking for most of the staff
at Camp 200. Correct and frequent saluting
made no appeal to him. Cyril’s uproarious
laughter at the lightest of his jokes appeared
rather to annoy him. He had not been in
the place a week when he began to talk of
making a one-armed friend of his adjutant,
lie followed up this barbarism by instructing
the adjutant to put himself on draft. The
adjutant explained that his heart was weak,
that he had not been inoculated, that the
Flanders winter would kill him, and that
anyhow he would have to get one of his toes
operated on first. The C.O. then asked, in
what the adjutant afterwards described as
“a distinctly sneering manner,” if there was
anything fatal the matter with Mr. Snap-
ford.
Cyril had always been a man of action in
emergencies. Without a moment’s delay he
made arrangements to transfer to the Motor
Transport Service.
His office work as a staff-captain in Rouen
is a patter of military history. He returned
to his native city lately. A morning daily
said in reference to the event: —
One of the brilliant younger men of the A.I.F.
was welcomed home yesterday, in the person of
Captain (T/Major) Snapford, D.S.O. An original
Anzac, his careful, yet at the same time daring,
work as a transport officer in a highly-important
executive position in a dangerous part of France
did much to hasten the inevitable victory of the
Imperial arms. Captain (T/Major) Snapford received
his well-earned decoration at -the hands of his
Majesty the King at Buckingham Palace at a recent
investiture. “A typical Digger!” the King is re-
ported to have remarked admiringly as the gallant
young fighter strode proudly off with his medal.
Cyril’s mother worries a good deal over the
petty jealousy in martial circles which
(combined with her boy’s bluff soldier’s ways
and inability to fawn) alone prevented him.
she is sure, from getting also a title or at
least a C.M.G.

HOW TO MAKE A TAR COUGH SYRUP
THAT CHILDREN LIKE.
Tar preparations usually taste so un-
pleasant that it is difficult to get children
to take them, and mothers who have ex-
perienced this difficulty will be glad to learn
that one of the cheapest as well as one of
the most effective cough syrups, and which
is at the same time so pleasant to take that
children ask for it, can be easily prepared
at home. Make a plain syrup by dissolving-
half a pound of sugar in half a pint of hot
water, and to this add the contents of a
2oz. bottle of bitrate of tar, which can be
obtained from the chemist. Stir well, and
when cool it is ready for use. From one-
half to one teaspoonful every hour or two
will quickly relieve a most stubborn cough
or cold and avoid the danger, ever present
in children, of contracting lung trouble,
influenza and pneumonia. For grown-up
people the dose may be doubled, and it will
be found particularly valuable in relieving
and preventin'* those, catarrhal and bron-
chial troubles which so frequently lead to
more serious complaints. For tickling in
the throat try putting a few drops of bitrate
of tar on a lump or sugar and slowly dis-
solve in the mouth. — Advt.

There is enough spectacle in “The Bing
Boys on Broadway” to make it glitter like
a panto; and a joyous “pony” ballet, which
sings and dances with amazing, vim* lends
it youthful gaiety arid provides an excuse
to take the kids to Sydney Majesty’s. There
has to be some rag of a plot to justify the
title, so two unconvincing crooks spend the
evening trying to steal the diamond garter
belonging to the Dowager Duchess of Dull-
water. This part of the show is melan-
choly.
A row of new principals hand plot and
extras over the footlights. Jennie Hartley,
as the English servant turned Duchess, is
a hard-working little brunette with a fair
singing voice and a teqflency to over-empha-
sise her comedy. Dan Agar, who plays
the English Bing cousin, is a very-English
low comedian who gets most of his laughs
quietly arid has a poor taste in songs. He
is an exponent of the fruity old English
“comic,” the ’ music keyed down to vanish-
ing point so that the singer can be heard
working up to one of the old standard jests,
all telegraphed ahead. ' Only the best’ of
these classics can compare with the Yankee
rag that lets the band go in a good hic-
cupping melody with every instrument work-
ing full time. The singer has to run and
yell, but it’s the music and rhythm that’s
wanted. Gus Bluett gets his chance as
Potifer Bing, the American cousin, and pre-
sents him as a good-natuYed, drawling
galoot. He hasn’t, the chances that came
his way as the mad office-boy of patent-
attorrfey Jack Cannot. Primrose Caryll
(Susie Bing) is a dainty songandance girl
who makes the house sit up when she plays
a xylophone accompaniment to her “Melody
Man” song on the hats of the young baller-
inas kneeling in a circle at her feet. Muriel
Hudson (“Diamond Gertie” on the bills)
has red-gold hair, searchlight eyes, vivacity
and a figure. As a cheerful singing vam-
pire ready for work in a trailing-blue gown,
she makes a fine central color-note for a
quaintly-lighted scene; but her specialty
vaudeville act with dancer Dave Dramin is
too strident. Dramin is a slick buck-dancer
who doesn’t hate his own work. In the
dancing department Phyllis Amery, in a
flying pas de trois, is associated with young
Mel Ward and Jan
Caryll. During a
brief burst of
operatic music
when the plot in-
trud e s, Myrtle
Power, as the
Duchess’s maid,
uses a ringing
soprano to carol
the news that the

with an opium-den

ing up a double

“Mother Hubbard)” which had a languid
four hours’ performance . at. Melbourne
King’s on Saturday night, will have- to be
mercilessly cut and revised before it can be
considered a reasonable success. Yet when
all the necessary amendments have been
made, people will probably still detect
a flagging spirit in > some of the essential
features of the showy The humor depart-
ment-seems especially depressed by backache,
pessimism and an unconscious-weakening of
the inventive faculty. Much, of the busi-
ness is plagiarism or undisguised repetition,
though the railway station disturbance is
absurdly irresponsible and Lupino’s Death of
Nelson on the pirate ship creates an
atmosphere of festive eccentricity. This
ship scene, with a confusion of shapely
sailoresses and an overflow of damsel fes-
tooning the rigging, is one of the liveliest
sections of the furtive story, and there is
appreciation of the harmony of white and
silver in the Palace of the Fairy, where the
invaluable Australian ballet turns to spark-
ling jewellery under the changing lights.
Also, the Autumn and Harlequin ballets,
graced by the twinkling extremities of Elsie
Parkes and Kelso Henderson, are of engag-
ing simplicity in color and design ; but the
prettiest effect is the Pipes of Pan, with
its suggestion of rosy felicity in a Grecian
twilight.
Excepting Cannot, Colin Crane (the Pirate
Chief) and Ethel Walker (the Fairy Queen),
the cast has almost the vocal weight of a
healthy canary, and hardly satisfies a hunger
for vivid personalities. The Dame (Barry
Lupino) confines her witchery, to gymnastic
exercises, and partially imprisons her humor
in a foggy utterance. Jack Cannot, as .Hub-
bard, appears to limit the flow of his native
Geniality, and toils like a recent convert to
the go-slow system ; but he captures bouquets
for his alphabet ditty and his burlesque of
i/o-na e Mobile” as sung by a certain over-
known tenor. Maurice Dudley, as a frantic
panto, miser, has no connection with the
society of I-won’t-works, and within the
limits of their opportunities Dorothy Leigh
and Daisy Yates are attractive always. The
imported princinals, Marjory Carlisle and
Wensley Russell, confirm one’s suspicions
regarding the scarcity of ginger in England.
Marjorie, as the Boy, tries to suggest vitality
with unduly stressed gestures, but she has
to ration her voice carefully to get through
in ordinary sentimental song. Wensley Rus-
sell achieves pretty twittering effects with
an under-nourished soprano. Hassan’s clever-
ness as a bulldog with a massive magic wish-
bone in liis tremendous jaws is a solid .delight
to the kiddies, and Moon and Morris, dis-
guised as the American humorists Mutt and
Jeff, excite applause with their quaint unan-
imity of thought and action. The fresh arid
smiling scenery by the Rowells is generally
overlooked behind the moving foregrounds of
levity and legs.
* * * *
If rich displays of adroit chorus-girl were
all-important features of a pantomime,
“Sleeping Beauty,” at Melbourne Majesty’s,
would be above the J.C.W. average. The
show is not magnificent in comparison with
brightest memories of yore; nevertheless, it
is well dressed, with more grace than ginger
in its composition. The action of the fairy
story, wherein long lapses of years are re-
presented by rolling clouds in the foreground,
is not adventurous. Shipwrecks and British
na/Val hornpipes are consequently absent;
likewise the ancient splendors of barbaric
processions and the weird gambols of an
alleged ' donkey or domestic animal. The
comic business is mostly provided by Marriott
Edgar, who is decorously funny and particu-
larly tuneful as Dame. The brothers Egbert
are very amusing in spots, but don’t always
avoid being tedious. Their unoriginal paper-
hanging scene is a mere riot of whitewash
and destruction, and much of their early con-
versation is poor stuff; but their knockabout
comedy in Act 2 is more than good.
Apart from the Egberts and the genteel
Dame and George Welch, who as King cuts a
small figure in a large part, the characters
range from sentimental to heavy. Margaret
Sutcliffe is a Shakspearean wicked fairy who
strives to blight the career of Miss Lynn in
the name part, whilst Winifred Roma,
another imported lady, is a tall, angular prin-
cipal boy who sings no lively ditties nor does
anything to shake things up. Eve Lynn afore-
said presents a. beauty of no special dis-
tinction, save that she mixes whistling with
her high soprano warble. All the ballet
portion of the panto, is dominated by Maggie
Dickinson, assisted by Sydney Yates. The
ballet work is not supremely effective at any
point of the show, neither arc Margot Lester,
Dorothy Seacombe and other fairies more
than charming incidents in an uneventful
Christmas annual. “The Sleeping Beauty
is just a picturesque panto, which everyone
will see and nobody will rave about. At
present it badly needs a pungent comic song
for the kiddies to chorus to, and Marriott
Edgar is seemingly the shemale who will have
to sing it.

“Cinderella” opened her boot-and-shoe store
at Sydney Opera House on Saturday, and
great will be the profit thereof before she
quits. The lady suffers from the usual pan-
tomime complaint. One-third of her should
be amputated and her one interval should be
duplicated. Murfayne, the “xylophone
fiend,” would do well to have a time-bomb
under liis instrument, for after half-an-hour
“THEODORE AND CO.” AT
MELBOURNE
ROYAL.
Pony Twitchem (Theodore Leonard) talks
about lace, etc., to Cosmo Legallos
(Reginald Roberts).
a xylophone is as musical as a hailstorm on
a tin shed. Apart from these things “Cin-
derella” promises well. The chorus, dancing
and costumes are exceptionally fine. Linda
Dale as Cinderella is everything the young-
sters expect her to be, ■ and the small child
is the critic that matters. Amy Rochelle
(Prince Charming) has a fine voice and a
fine pair of , but children are too youug
to notice that, and it’s their panto. Ivy
Moore as the Prince’s friend Dandenie may
or may not have a retainer from Opaloid,
but a too-protracted display of molar is apt
to become tiresome, especially , when one lias
red hair and blue tights. Theresa Matana
gives a splendid exhibition of her tonsils in
her “Baby’s Arms” song, and the kids
thoroughly enjoy Stiffy and Mo, the comedy
pair. The snow scene, the Prince’s palace
and the final scene are brimful of splendor,
and the music will help the dividends.
Altogether, with the aid of an axe and a
Turkish bath, the Fullers should be able to
make the panto well worth while, and doubt-
less that will be done within a day or so.
John Cosgrove has introduced a gun-
powdery atmosphere to Melbourne Princess’s
with a romantic naval drama, “Jutland.”
The big marine scrimmage is apparently a
tableau happening casually in the rush of
lesser events, but if the scuppers of vague
Dreadnoughts are not running with blud,
there is premeditated stoush when H.M.S.
Courageous clears for action and John
McGowan (specially engaged) ends the
Emden in a big baritone voice. Other
shocks to the ear-drums are supplied by a
Zeppelin raid, and a further thrill is a glove
fight for the championship of the fleet.
Most of the mischief seems the work of the
demented Otto von Coblentz, a German spy
and miscellaneous miscreant whom Bob
Inman dutifully makes to fume like a keg
of boiling, treacle. His utter malignancy
would even invite the suspicion of Hughes’s
Commonwealth police. Roy Redgrave is the
tapering and triumphant hero, Captain
David Gordon, R.N.: and Lieut. Horace
Grahame is a feast of flesh and overflow of
soul in the hands of the plump and prac-
tised Cosgrove. Richard Morell has the
part of Admiral Sir Harry Brooklands, but
most eyes are concentrated on the bonnie
midshipman, Thomas Jones, whom Joan
Ogilvie fills with the right heroic temper.
Bessie Brunell, as Susan Brown, is one of
the jokes of the evening; Adele Inman
sweetens the nice role of Patricia O’Moore;
and the Misses Maxwell and Worth represent
Lady Brooklands and daughter without
damage to the traditions of the British peer-
age. The scenery by Rege Robins and
others is creditable enough for a popular
show.
Sydney Royal bids for its share of the
Christmas crowds with “The Priest and the
Girl,” and a good many people will spend
money to see if the melodrama in which the
Charles Stanford players are involved is as
lurid as its title. It isn’t. A distracted
maiden is “pursued,” but the villainous pur-
suer starts from 100 yards behind scratch
and never catches up. In the end the lady
is won by the honest sailor, while the Jew
who makes the plot work is exposed and
driven into the old-clo’ business. Charles
Stanford, as Father Donovan, referees in a
dignified way.
“Lightnin’ ” continues to show to rapt
houses at Sydney Criterion. The motif
which runs through it like some splendid
melody—that of Drink —has a wonderful
allurement at this season of the year and
in the existing crisis in the beer trade, Old
Bill plays to what is practically an audi-
ence of Liglitnin's during much of the even-
ing.
“As You Were” is now travelling at top
behind the Sydney Tivoli electrics that flood
Castlereagh-street. The specially-engaged
beauties were photographed on one of the
surf beaches during the week, and all look
cheerful. Perhaps the £lO per week is do-
ing it.
Sara Allgood in “Peg o’ My Heart” con-
tinues her Australian farewell at the Palace
(Sydney).
Time has brought even “Jane Eyre” on to
the Moviys. She is at Sydney Crystal
Palace and Strand under the title of “Woman
and Wife,” Jane being the Woman. Alice
Brady renders a Jane who isn’t altogether a
timid little dove of a governess. The Blue
Bird spreads its wings at the Haymarket
and the Shell. Very alluring wings they
are, too, as they speed through the Palace of
Night, the Cathedral of Happiness and the
Azure Palace, Robin Macdougall and Tula
Bell are the clever kiddies who lose and seek
and find the bird again.-
“Theodore and Co.” supplies the Christmas
want at Melbourne Royal. It serves as
well as another kind of musical comedy, and
better than some; also the nimbleness of
new-man Leonard is an asset at this season
of acrobatic endeavor. Humor runs in all
shapes, and characters are very varied in
“Theodore and Co”; but nobody puts a
stronger strain on probability than the ele-
gantly-tailored duke: (Arthur Stirling) who
doesn’t know his own charming and accom-
plished daughter (Gladys Moncrieff) when
he meets her in Act 2.
“Petticoat Fair” will last Melbourne
Tivoli through the holidays, seemingly.
Compared with rival song-and-dance enter-
tainments this is remarkable for sustained
narrative and lack of s urpri Kgs.' : V?, When Rego
enters on liis task of wheeling Minnie Love’s
alleged baby around he is confidently ex-
pected to reappear at intervals with the
perambulator in charge, and he does so.
Nothing ever happens at the home for War-
working Women to give the audience a shock.
Two or three people on the stage harbor
cruel suspicions re the origin of the baby,
but the folks in front, knowing exactly how
matters stand, wait patiently for misun-
derstandings to be cleared away. The art-
less story moves gently on towards a tune-
ful climax, and would-he - funnier if Ken-
nedy Allen had a little more vim and a
heavier punch. The second week of “Petti-
coat Fair” finds Aldridge and Nell. Flem-
ming helping to make things go, whilst the
services of the chorus have acquired more
weight and polish.
Hoyt’s in Melbourne have captured
Dorothy Gish for a few nights’ run in
“Peppy Polly,” a fable of a reformatory
girl reformed through the leading lady. The
film is full of queer philanthropists, but
the prize for quaintness goes to a matron
who gets distended eyeball through linger-
ing at keyholes. Hoyt’s also unreel “Alias
Mike Moran,” a war story about a slacker’s
cold feet and his donah’s proud heart. Else-
where Gladys Brockwell in “The Forbidden
Room” cleans up the police department
while throwing googly glances, at the usual
handsome attorney. The Majestic, manage-
ment is reviving Charlotte Bronte in a pre-
tentiously modern adaptation of “Jane
Eyre.” The story is “Woman and Wife,”
and Alice Brady does a Cook’s tour of the
emotions before she is handed over to the
ingenious Rochester.

Adelaide shows are various, and for a full
week the weather has been kind. The Ameri-
can boys have been giving their all-round
show at the Royal. In the open, at Austral
Gardens, the Fads and Fashions Co. has
got into its stride and brightened its pro-
gramme. With George Walton, Harry
Graham, Sharrat. and Deal, it is strong on
the humorous side. The Tivoli, is waking up
nsrain with the return of Denis Ivehoe and
“Mother Macliree.” Adelaide audiences
usually hate to join in choruses; but at the
Majestie they seem: to enjoy doing it at
Leonard Nelson’s invitation. Cats, pigeons
and other performers remain much as - before.

POVERTY
POINT
“J.F.H.” (Loudon) : Dorothy Brunton’s
latest appearance is at the Shaftesbury, a
long-time unlucky theatre until Australian
George Musgrove broke the spell with “The
Belle of New York.” “Baby Bunting,” in
which Dorothy is playing the leading feminine
role, looks like repeating that success. It
had a brilliant send-off, with highly com-
plimentary notices and unanimous predic-
tions of a long run. It is an up-to-date musi-
cal-comedy version of “Jane,” a farce by
Harry Nicholls and William Lestocq, that
scored a generation ago—a mad thing ouilt
on the worries and subterfuges of a young
bachelor who led his rich uncle to believe
that he had a wife and family, and was
called on to provide them at short notice
when the old boy unexpectedly looked him
up. The outstanding success of the show is
a new American comedian of the quiet, droll,
incisive order. Walter Catlett. Dorothy
Brunton played up to him in sparkling style.
“F 8”: Monte Luke, whose camera has
caught the smile of many a mummer, is join-
ing the Falk studios. The profession in
Sydney will miss the little studio at the top
of “the Firm’s” building in Castlereagh-
street, which was a sort of unofficial club
for mummers. Originally an actor, Luke
found the dry plate a more lucrative medium
for his talents, and having the J.C.W. pic-
torial publicity work to handle, was never
at a loss for subjects.
“T.D.M.”: Elton was not the only artist
of whom Charles Warner was jealous during
his Australian tour (B. 4/12/T9). He had
to play second fiddle to Herbert Flemming in
“Captain Swift.” “The man with the God-
like head,” as Louise Pomeroy styled Flem-
ming, put Warner in the shade, although the
“Lightnin'." at Sydney
Criterion.
Kenneth Brampton as
the scheming lawyer.
English star had
the fat part, and
Warner hated the
critics for praising
the other’s acting.
Then Augusta Dar-
gon, specially lured
from her retire-
ment to play Lady
Macbeth to
Warner's Thane of
Cawdor, caused
him heartburnings.
A most accom-
plished artiste, she
edged Warner into
the background in
their .scenes, a n d
again the green-
eyed monster began
to gnaw at his
vitals. Still Warner
was unlucky com-
pared with other
English importa-
tions. He visited
Australia at a time
when his support
was of the highest
class. In Sydney,
by the way, he had
with him Ada Ward, then beginning to be
decadent but still most capable.
“Ike Pagliacei”: Bella Berman, who
directs tlie energies of the ballet in “Cin-
derella” at Sydney Grand Op. House, is one
of the three clever Bermans whose fame
reached London 12 months ahead of
them. The trio left Australia to dance
through India, and Robert Courtneidge
cabled them offers of English contracts.
Despite this encouragement, it was a full
year before they developed pluck enough to
take the plunge. They arrived in London
on a Sunday and opened at the Palace on
Monday. That was the beginning of seven busy
years in England, two of them being in
Geo. Edwardes’s show with G. P. Huntley
as a fellow-member. Musgrove brought the
trio back to Australia for “Aladdin” —the
last Australian pantomime in which Nell
Stewart was principal boy. The Bermans
made their dancing start with Mac Lean, the
father of Eddie and Decima, who are a
reigning hit at the London Alhambra.
“Rouge”: Experience qualifies George
Marlow for his threatened return to man-
agement. There are few ropes in Showdom
that he didn't pull to haul himself to the
front. In I8!)4 he was touring with
Johnny Gourlay in “Skipped by the Light
of the Moon,” and about the same period he
was helping Jake Friedman run a dramatic
season by playing the villain at the Manly
Aquarium. He toured as Geoffrey Ware in
“The Silver King” to Ned Duggan’s Denver,
and was in Rignold’s “Faust,” with Scot
Inglis, Harry Blimmer, Cyrfl Iveightley, J.
W. Hazlitt and D’Orsay Ogden in the cast.
He was “forward representative” for W. F.
Clitherow’s tour of “Little Lord Fauntleroy”
and played Pantaloon in pantomime in 1895
THE REMEDY.

I am freezing with cold!”

or thereabouts. Other early programmes

“George Marlow, the Dutch Comedian.”
lie was with Rignold again when William
Anderson was general manager and played
in Irve Hayman’s eo. when Bert Bailey Avas
getting the limelight as hero. At length, when
Broughton Van Burg beame lessee and man-
ager of the Aquarium Hall, Manly, he was
made a star, his name appearing opposite the
character of Tony Faust in “My Sweet-
heart.”
“S.S. ’: Again I protest that theatrical
managements are as liable to prosecution for
misrepresentation and obtaining money by
false pretence as any other traders, and I
call for an organisation that will undertake
such prosecution in particularly glaring
cases. I paid 175., plus tax, the other day
for two tickets to a metropolitan show
whose excellences had been dinned into my
ears for weeks, and found I had been be-
trayed into giving good coin for a shamefully
meagre and inept performance, an entertain-
ment far below the level of the ordinary beach
frivol, for which less than half the price of
admission is demanded. One’s helplessness
in the face of such a confidence trick is gall-
ing. A strong man might awake, arise,
and break the furniture, and throw the frag-
ments at the performers, but a weak person
of law-abiding and orderly habits is a hope-
less prey to the spoiler.
“Vaud. Yet.” : Jack Kearns (B. 20/11/T9)
was the first vaudeville artist in Australia
to play two halls on the one night. Harry
Rickards attempted to run Sydney Tivoli
and Alhambra simultaneously, and Kearns,
then partner with McKisson, was commis-
sioned to appear at both. The two theatres
ran neck and neck for a fortnight, after
which the Alhambra was scratched for all
vaudeville engagements. The slickest change-
over of whole shows was managed by the
Tails with “Tokio Town.” They played
Kurri Ivurri and Weston (N.S.W.) on the
one night, the first half in one town being
the second half in the other, and vice versa.
At interval time, though the audiences didn t
know it, they were about five miles from the
nearest Japs, who. travelling by motors,
stopped midway betwixt towns to say
“Banzai.”
“Greentape”: If the Peace-signing was as
dull as the movie makes it out, only a
very polite spectator could have avoided
yawning. And the show as I saw it at the
Auditorium is not helped on by putting a
man in front to call out the names of the
notabilities. As a display of bald heads the
assemblage in the Hall of Mirrors may have
some claims to attention, but the grouping
in the front stalls at any first night of a
musical comedy would beat it out of sight.
“Snell”: One night when Chas. Ryley
was at the Princess’s in frivolous opera a
note was handed him
by one of the ushers,
which read: "Lady,
lumber 3 to the left,
third row. would be
delighted if Mr. Ryley
would meet her for a
few minutes’ conversa-
tion after the perform-
ance to-niglit.” A ren-
dezvous was mentioned
at the gardens fence,
close to the Treasury
Buildings, at no great
distance fro m the
theatre. Ryley looked
from a peephole, and
found the lady third
from the end in row 3
to be young and charm-
ingly dressed, and of
uncommon beauty ; hut,
as it unfortunately hap-
pened, he had an un-
avoidable engagement
for the time specified.
However, there was a
young blood in his
dressing-room who took
at a running jump the
chance of an adventure.
He persuaded Ryley to
let the date stand. “I’ll
go and apologise for
you, and see what’s
doing,” said' the buck.
Ryley, who had no great
compunction in such
cases, agreed, and the
friend kept the appoint-
ment. The next Ryley
heai-d of the tender
adventure was the sad
story of how his young
friend attended at the
place specified, and was
set upon by a couple of
toughs and robbed of everything of value lie
carried. The lady in the case was sub-
sequently identified as the wife of a Mel-
bourne doctor, who knew nothing of the
fact that she was utilised as a lure by a
brace of humorous criminals.
An unobtrusive part in “The Sentimental
Bloke” is that of the Doctor, but few recog-
nise in the burly form and almost leonine
head the personality of R. Bonar, a well-
known Sydney pressman.
“J.F.H.” (London) : Australians Oscar
Asehe and Oswald Stoll are responsible for
a new spectacular success, “Eastward Ho,”
at the Alhambra. The cardinal defect of
the show is the absence of a first-class
comedian, of the George Robey or W. S.
Percy pattern, capable of improvising gags
and so supplying the deficiencies of the
“book.” There is little originality in the
production ; it is just a new twist of the old
theme of a hunt for a buried treasure. Oscar
Asehe locates the swag beneath the altar of
a ruined Phoenician temple; this affords him
the opportunity of revelling once more in
gorgeous color. Three expeditions start in
quest of the treasure, and, of course, they
arrive simultaneously. Then follows a clever
transformation. The temple is suddenly re-
stored to all its ancient magnificence, with
Violet Lorraine enthroned above the 'altar as
high priestess. Violet is the bright star
of the production. She warbles a number of
capital songs, including a melodious number
called “Dreams,” which has made a big hit.
The Australian dancers Decima and Eddie
McLean contribute a turn of the most daring,
beAvildering, greased-lightning order, and one
of the oustanding successes of the show.
Among other gorgeous scenes is one of a
fancy-dress ball on the P. and O. Osterley.
“AS YOU WERE,” AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Paris (Hugh Steyne) in Lore.
Helen of Troy (Vera Pearce).
“Fax”: “Butterfly,” as sung by the present
J.C.W. co., is not so sweet as when Bel Sorel
and Amy Castles were alternated in the
name part. Fred Blarney and John Zerga
were their respective Pinkertons, and Rpsina
Buckman their faithful Suzuki. The fall-
ing off in charm is nowhere so noticeable as
in the scene where the Yankee consul reads
the letter that is intended to break the bad
news to Butterfly. Arthur Crane was the
Sharpless nine-years ago, and the baritone
of nowadays hasn’t the beautiful tone that
distinguished Crane’s reading of the letter.
It was unforgettable. The blend of sing-
ing and accompaniment has never been
equalled in subsequent productions of the
opera. Incidentally, Amy Castles has not
added any honey to her notes since 1910.
“S.T.S.”: That Kangaroo Island trouble
which came of the wadding from a blank
cartridge entering a man’s hip at close quar-
ters and causing fatal complications (B.
13/11/T9), throws a light on the strict rule
of modern actors never to point a firearm
straight. I saw Leslie Victor lately, in
“Seven Keys to Baldpate,” aim very obviously
downwards, near a girl’s feet. She dropped
dead, and, when another character remarked
approvingly “You shoot to kill,” there was
a titter. But if the blank-charge weapon
really has fatal possibilities, a little realism
is worth losing.
Rupert Browne, the young scenic artist
who since the Armistice has been assisting
veteran English scenic painter Bruce Smith,
is said to be the first Australian-born scenic
artist to toil at old Drury. He is homeward
bound in the Ypiringa.
TRUMPETS OF THE HAWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Put away the brazen bugles! Bring the trumpets
made of tin,
For the day of joy is coming and the kids must
make a din!
Sling them lightly by the pillows. You will waken
with a yawn
When you hear the painted trumpets wheezing
bravely to the dawn.
Oh, the bugle drags its men up, or it whirls the guns
away,
And it sings all into silence at the end of some drear
day;
But the little painted trumpets have no grief in
them at all,
And the house is filled with laughter when from bed
to bed they call.
It is good to hear the racket! It is fine to see their
joy!
Let ’em blow and keep it going ! Join the band and
be a boy !
Puff your years and troubles from you when the
thin calls fade and die,
Snatching up the painted trumpet with “Let Daddy
have a try!”

"DIGEST WHAT YOU EAT.”
Do you enjoy what you eat? If you don’t your food does not do you much good. There is no way to maintain
the health and strength of mind and body except by nourishment. There is no way to nourish the body except through the
stomach. The stomach must be kept healthy, pure and sweet, or the strength will go down and disease will result. Dr. Sheldon’s
Digestive Tabules is the remedy that everyone should take when there is anything wrong with the stomach.
A POOR APPETITE.
Loss of strength, nervousness, headache,
bad breath, heartburn, indigestion and dys-
pepsia are quickly banished by the use of
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules. These
Tabules represent the natural juices and
reconstructive properties. They simply do
the work of the stomach, relieving that
weakened organ and permitting it to rest
and recuperate. When you take Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules everything you
eat tastes good, and every bit of the nutri-
ment that the food contains is assimilated
and appropriated by the blood and tissues.

will not permit of sufficient to be eaten to
ensure health and strength. A weak
stomach cannot digest enough food to
keep up the strength even if it were eaten.
Do not try to banish dyspepsia or other
stomach troubles by dieting. Satisfactory
work of muscle or brain cannot be per-
formed on half rations. A variety of food
and plenty of it is necessary. DR. SHEL-
DON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES is the
remedy that will let you eat all you need—
or want. If you use DR. SHELDON’S
DIGESTIVE TABULES you will soon be
able to eat any and all kinds of food.

They are the real thing for indigestion
says Mr. Wallace Nelson, Jun.
I have recently returned from the Front by the Sardinia, and when I arrived here I
was certainly feeling very much out of sorts indeed. The bad food on the trip upset not
only me but many of my pals, and we were all of us suffering from gastric troubles and
very severe indigestion, and generally feeling very run down.
Before I left Australia, from the Perth “Sunday Times,” two and a half years ago,
I knew Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules as a thoroughly sound and reliable remedy for
such ailmencs, and in my worries my thoughts recurred to them, and I at once obtained
a tin of the Tabules and started to use them. I felt the benefit of them from the first, and
am pleased to say that my digestion is now quite normal, and I think the world of the
Tabules, for they did certainly fix me r.ght again, as they’ did some of my pals, to whom
I recommended them.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are certainly the real thing for indigestion, and I can
honestly recommend them to anyone suffering from gastric troubles or indigestion of any
nature. Yours truly,
(Sgd.) WALLACE NELSON, Jun.,

Mr. CHARLES VILLIERS.
(From a photo, by Monte Luke.)
I want to write and tell you how good I think your Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are, for I am in a
position to say, having suffered exceedingly from indigestion, and after trying them I found them to be the
best remedy ever for indigestion.
Whenever I have a big dinner at the hotel or elsewhere, I always have a Digestive Tabule afterwards, and
therefore never suffer any ill-effects from same. Why anyone should go about troubled with indigestion when
such a remedy as Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules can be obtained is more than I can understand. I can assure
you I can heartily recommend them, for I know they are good.
Yours truly, (Sgd.) CHARLES VILLIERS,

Make Your Stomach Strong and Healthy.
Thousands of people who have suffered from stomach troubles and general ill-health
resulting therefrom, because of a badly-regulated diet and the ingesting of an excessive amount of
food at the table, have obtained speedy and permanent relief by means of a simple expedient
—that of using one or two of Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules after each meal, or whenever any of
the well-known symptoms of indigestion are present. These wonderful Digestive Tabules contain
the same elements as are found in a healthy stomach. They take the place of the natural
digestive juices when the latter are deficient in quality or quantity, and do their work for
them, removing the indigestion by digesting the food and resting, strengthening and purifying
the digestive tract.
There is no other digestive remedy on the market wh ch has been found equal to Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules; none
which is so rapidly and powerfully efficient, or which removes discomfort, banishes stomach pain and relieves and removes all
the symptoms of dyspepsia and indigestion in so thorough a manner as these marvellous Tabules. They digest your food and
make your stomach strong and healthy once more.
So try them for yourself. Sold everywhere at 1/6 per tin, or large size, holding more than twice the quantity, price 2/6.

A.J.C. Villiers Stakes of last year was
taken by an imported horse —Rebus. On Saturday
Anyhow, another imp., helped himself to the item.
It was 100's to three and four the winner at the
start, and anyone who wanted to bet in running
could probably have improved on that. Right up to
the distance it looked a sure thing for either of two
—Panacre or Satin Bird. Volpi and Panacre were
quickly out, and at the half-mile there were a couple
of lengths of Panacre to spare in front. As he
swung round the turn the gap widened a little. At
this stage Satin Bird was six or seven horses back.
But on the run home years and weight began to
tell on the leader, and Satin Bird, catching him at
the Leger, struggled to the front. Then, just as
all hands were yelling about the certainty and get-
ting ready to collect, Anyhow, who had moved up
behind Satin Bird, came on, and in the last 50 yards
buried the lot. It was almost a repetition of Satin
Bird’s annexation of the 1917 Epsom from Wedge.
On that occasion the Bird got in front mainly
because Wedge was beginning to stop. This time
the tussle lower down the straight punctured Satin
Bird. If MxLachlan had cut down Panacre a second
later, Anyhow would not have hit the front so
easily, if at all. The pace over the last three fur-
longs was tremendously fast. They ran the mile in
“38J.”
The win of Anyhow with 7st. 31b. up provides yet
another dreadful warning to tipsters and punters
as to the folly of trying to find winners by
deduction from performances and comparison of
weights. A year ago this nag won over a mile in
a handicap at Randwick from a moderate lot. Sub-
sequently he made half a dozen efforts on suburban
courses and never got a place. In the last Don-
caster he carried 7st. 81b., and was missing from
the first dozen at the end. In the Spring he ran
LIEUR-COLONEL KINGSCORE,
who is to captain the British Isles team in
the Davis Cup matches.
twice unplaced at Randwick, and during this month
had finished well astern in a couple of eight-furlong
happenings at Canterbury Park and Rosehill. If
this calamitous record pointed to anything at all it
indicated that in a race like the Villiers Anyhow
hadn’t Buckley’s. The suddenly improved animal is
trained by Paddv Nolan, and belongs to Nicholas
and Fox," of W.A., whose previous importation,
Early Morn, won three races in three weeks a couple
of years ago.
Publican, the early boom for the Villiers,
ran like a dingo. He was the fittest horse in the
race. Yet though well placed early in the pro-
ceedings and fourth into the straight, he petered
•sut to nothing.
With practice and more elbow-room the
totalisator staff at Randwick has taken to handling
the cash with great expedition. The pay-out windows
now go up as quickly after a race as they do in
Maoriland.
Newcastle had a bad spin at Randwick on
Saturday. Panacre, Spillway, Running Fire, Jack
Findlay and a two-year-old were sent along from
the North, and cash was piled on in hatfuls—and
in every case it stayed wliere it was put. The
most conspicuous failure of the lot was Spillway.
Backed like a certainty in the Holiday Handicap,
he got chopped back at the barrier, and was so
annoyed that he never even started to gallop.

Hunting proceeds in Ireland unaffected by
Sinn Fein. The pre-war Masters, many of whom
are Englishmen, are in charge again for the most
part, and Sinn Feiners and minions of the Castle
obey their orders with equal docility. The famous
Carlow pack has a kind of Australian interest. Its
present M.H. succeeded Robert Watson, who succeeded
his father, John Watson. The two Watsons —mem-
bers of the famous sporting family which gave Aus-
tralia starter Tom Watson and his Victorian brother
—hunted the pack, year in year out, for just on a
century.

The much-discussed Vic. measure providing
for the compulsory examination and registration of
stallions should be adopted in every Australian State.
War is the ruin of a horse-producing country’s stock.
The best go first. Then the long-sighted begin breed-
ing for the years ahead. By that time the standard
has declined, and the competing buyers are taking
almost anything that can stand up. Australia-had
had the equine eyes almost picked out of it by the
Japs and others before the world-war was thought of.
Large fortunes were subsequently made by specu-
lators in the exportation of our remaining capital in
horseflesh; and the animals so sold are not returning.
With the demand for horses still brisk the tendency
will be to produce on the cheap—that is to say, to
fill the country with weeds —unless the State Go\ern-
ments check it. The Waler may become yet again
what he was 20 years ago—the most-esteemed general-
utility animal in the world. Or he may degenerate
into something of the class which was being offered
to buyers in 1916. It is all a matter of the line of
action taken by those in authority.

Thirty years ago the New Year’s Ray
meeting at Flemingtou got more preliminary
advertisement than it does nowadays, although
the V.R.C. gate receipts are now probably a
third higher, on an average. The Standish
Plate and Bagot Handicap double used to be
a popular gamble with punters throughout Victoria,
and even in Sydney. Betting on the two races was
published many days in advance of the event. An
aroma of greatness seemed to cling to the meeting
because it used to be dignified by the three miles
Champion Stakes race ; but when the Autumn Meeting
grew into a four-days’ fixture that race was trans-
ferred, and is now known as the King’s Plate, distance
two miles only, and the big New Year punting was
shifted to Svdney. So the Flemington meeting has
lost a lot of its interest for the bookmaker —the
bookmaker who still lives, roars and has his being
by the aid of bribery and wowserism. But it has
gained popularity as a holiday gathering. The
weather is attractive, as a rule, and t)jc crowd in
the reserves not too large for the accommodation.
Besides, there is always the chance of one spotting a
likely winner of the Newmarket among the field for
the Standish. The six furlongs sprint down- the
Flemington straight has 32 entries this year (includ-
ing the clumsily-named Ready, Aye lleady, of
N.S.W.), and the winner is as likely to be a rank
outsider as a red-hot favorite. Which remark hardly
applies to the Bagot, with its 23 entries. Twenty
of the candidates for the 12 furlongs event are en-
gaged also in the Hopetoun Cup (11 furlongs), run
at Caulfield on Boxing Day, so the shorter race
promises to be more or less of a public trial for the
other.

“Staff Captain”: Most amusing “horse”
event I have seen took place in France last year.
The 3rd Zouave Regiment and the 6th Australian
Infantry Brigade were in the line together, the
former south and the latter north of the Atniens-
Peronne road. Both forces were relieved about the
same time, and a few days later we received a press-
ing invitation to the Zouave Sports, held 'veil within
range of the heavies. Twelve mules, fitted only with
bridles, were produced, and a dozen poilus mounted
their steeds. An area of country was given to the
competitors, and the rider who sat his mount the
longest was to be the winner. Off they went, accom-
pained by the yells of Digger and poiln. ovev and
through trenches, wire entanglements, broken fences,
torn trees, spectators and broken bush. Some jibbed,
some pranced and others bucked like whale" ne devils.
Eventually one man was left, but it took j. 5 minutes
to bring him back to consciousness.
Sydney Grammar had its 23rd win in 37
matches when it defeated Melbourne Grammar last
week. Slcipner J. E. Pratten banged 100 and 40
and took eight wickets for 125 for the College-
street School. For Melbourne B. Wood top-
scored in each innings with 37 and 74 ; and the
wieket-gatherers were D. Cuming (seven for 162)
and J. Smith (six for 77). #
The sixth round of Svdney first-grade
cricket ended on Saturday with Western Suburbs still
on top by 19 competition points. Glebe registered
their first, win this season. But the surprise match
was Waverley v. Wests, which the latter won by an
innings and six runs. It was mainly owing to
Amott’s length bowling (five for 23) in the East-
erners’ second “knock.” (Another important factor
of course was the impoverishment the Waverley side
had suffered at the hands of the State selectors.)
Sydney beat Gordon (the Northerners’ only bowler
being away) by 26 runs on the first innings. Middle Har-
bor just downed Petersham, also on the first effort.
Gee, the M.H. skipper, made one of the efforts of his
life —an incomparable 111 (not out) —but he did it
an innings too late. ’Varsity fluked a win against
Balmain (by nine runs on the first innings) in a
game which was anybody’s to the last. Glebe, such
is the glorious uncertainty of the game, easily licked
Norths. Graves first got Norths out and then de-
clined to be shifted himself. His 81, though tedious
in its compilation, did much to win the match. C.
Cumberland only just outed Paddington in the end
—getting there by a bare 39 on the first innings.
O’Keefe (nine for 67) had the orchardists utterly
demoralised in the closing stages.
The N. S. Wales first innings score of 690
against S. Aus. was well up among the records.
S.A. rather specialises in this sort of thing. The
1907 English XI made 660 for eight wickets at
Adelaide in 1907, and Vic. amassed 699 against
S.A.’s 1908 XI on the Melbourne ground. But the
Adelaideans’ most painful experience of leather-
hunting was 18 years ago, when N.S.W. at Sydney
piled up the monstrous total of 918 against them.
A characteristic of the match which started at Adel-
aide last Saturday was the cold contempt displayed
by all parties for the S. Aus. bowling. Bardsley,
Bogle. Andrews and Kellewav made their centuries
with the freedom of first-graders relaxing themselves
amongst rustics, and even bowlers Mailey and Nor-
man were good for 60 between them.

“Centurion”: That Glenelg two-up school
in the sandhills (B. 11/12/’l9) will awaken
memories in Light Horsemen who were at Romani
camp in the days just before and after the big
Sinai scrap. The snieling “heads” of the Ist L.H.
Brigade established there one of the best all-round
open-air schools I have
ever seen. It was in a
deep hollow half-way
between the Ist and
2nd regiments, and the
track between the 2nd
Brigade and the Field
Canteen ran close by.
The scene as night was
falling, with the neatly
arranged carpets, crown
and anchor cloths, etc.,
was inspiring. Candles,
stuck in bottles round
the different pitches,
provided illumination.
About the only
scare the talent ever
got was from some
officers returning from
leave. Riding from
railhead, these missed
their way in the dark,
and blundered into the
hollow. The talent
hopped it, thinking it
a raid by the Provost,
but returned presently
to find its cash lying
where it had been left.
They knew then that it
wasn’t the “Jacks.”
MAJOR LOWE,
of the British Isles
Davis Cup Team.
“Stumps”: With the revival of cricket in
Engjand there is a wail about the dearth of fast
bowlers. The pros, would be glad to have back
Jack Crossland, whose language was too much for
the “Gentlemen” of 40 years ago. For East Lan-
cashire he did some wonderful work, but never failed
after getting his third consecutive wicket to yell at
the pavilion, “Send round that blanky hat.” On one
occasion a batting clergyman unexpectedly gave him
trouble. Crossland grew more and more vicious in
his attack. At last he succeeded in clean-bowling his
man, whereupon he exulted at the top of his voice,
“Down goes his pulpit.”
The inter-college cricket in Adelaide this
year was a good thing for St. Peter’s, who are
gradually getting back the old sporting form which
for several years seemed all to have gone to Prince
Alfred’s. They scored 282 and 327 against the
Prince’s 142 and 168. The losers seemed to have
a strong side, but, as the wickets were well divided
up, probably the batting was weak all round. Wald’s
74 for St. Peter’s was easily the best of the mutch.
The scores in the long series of games now stands:
Saints, 22; Princes, 19. Two games in the
’eighties were left unfinished.
Vie. selectors have included little new
blood for the Sheffield Shield match y. N. S. Wales.
Warwick Armstrong (capt.), Baring, Iremonger,
McDonald, Ransford, Ryder and Park were m the
1914-5 Vic. XI; and Edgar Mayne (formerly of
S.A.) is another old stager. The newcomers are
Ellis, Hartkopf and Keating.
“FY7”: Re those schooner-rigged trains
prophesied in a recent Bulletin. Southport, on the
Lancashire coast, is a great holiday resort for the
local longshoremen take visitors for a sail in
a tray-shaped contraption on three wheels —•
only a mile-wide strip of hard, wet sand. On this the
local longshoremen take visitors for a sail on the
sands in a tray-shaped contraption on three wheels —
two in front and one behind, this last the rudder.
A lug and jib get plenty of pace up, and the craft
sails on or off the wind quite as well as the ordinary
water-going tubs. More than that, they can induce
the ordinary symptoms of sea-sickness quite as
quickly. In my day capsizes were frequent in a
strong breeze, and the lasses from Blackburn and
Bolton used to show they had a nice taste in hose.
Eric Apperley gathered in the champion of
championships at Ivillara (Sydney) on Saturday,
hi the morning he went round the 18 holes in
f,7—equal to the professional figures for the course,
and six strokes better than W. P. Maschwitz’s amateur
best. He was 14 worse after lunch, but managed
to win by nine strokes from Tom Howard (157) ;
W. 0. Sturrock (158) runner-up.
A Wellington (M.L.) junior cricket club
banged together 700 for six wickets the other day.
Three brothers named Murphy scored centuries at
an average rate of two runs a minute.

H. A. Parsons clipped the Adelaide to Mel-
bourne motor-bike record down to 19hr. 20min. last
week —an improvement of lomin. on the previous
best. He rode an Indian (with side-car) wearing
Boomerang tyres. # # »
N. S. Wales howling season opened on
Saturday with the John Young Shield —a competi-
tion in which the club witji the biggest majority
on the day took the ornament. Killara won from
Cheltenham by 169 —100. Drummoyne’s 190 to 133
over Ryde was next best.
B. Wearing covered 22ft. 2in. in the run
ning broad-jump at the South Sydney A.A.
pionships on Saturday. It was 3in. better than R.
J. Honner’s leap at the recent Dunn Shield cham-
pionships ; but is still 17in. behind Mat Rosengrave s
N.S.W. figures. R. F. Cripps took the 100yds. in
lOlsec.; T. H. Ferguson, the 220yds (24 l-ssec.)
and 440yds (55 l-ssec.) ; and T. Fraser the half-
mile (2min. 16 l-ssec.) and mile (smin. 4 l-ssec),
all pretty poor times. #
Jamito, the hurricane Filipino fighter,
weighed Bst. 121 b. for his engagement with Jack Green
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday night. Green, who is
putting on weight, was Bst. 71b. —four pounds heavier
than in his last fight with Mendies. The colored
youth laid himself out recklessly to k.o. Green,
forgetful apparently of the fact that Green, given
the opportunity, is himself capable of knocking
out most men in his class. Tingle and Jack Finney
are among his victims. But despite the openings
that were given him, he couldn’t drop Jamito,
though the latter dropped himself in the 11th
round in a frantic swing at the Caucasian’s
midriff. At the end of 20 convulsive sessions the
referee declared it a draw, a decision which was
approved by most of the big crowd present.
•Tack Dempsey is wise to stick out for a
fortune in his coming fight with Carpentier. His
career so far has been on the lines of that of Peter
Maher, or our own Bill Squires. Maher, like Demp-
sey (and Squires), overwhelmed the opposition till
he met a real front-ranker. The U.S. Spoke of him
as Australia still does of Darcy until Fitzsimmons
put him in his place—after which he never “drew"
again. No one knows yet liow good or how bad
Dempsey is. If the oft-defeated French cruiser-
weight beats him he will be shown up as very poor
indeed.

Frank Thorn, whose custom it is to re-
move an entire set of false teeth before leaving his
corner at the beginning of the first round, had an
easy win over Jerry Sullivan at Brisbane Stadium
on Saturday night. Thorn’s straight lefts and right
crosses were perfect samples of their class, and his
condition lasted to the end. A wonderful perform-
ance for a pug. who was a veteran 15 years
Desert Gold, one of the greatest mares
the world has known, goes to the stud this season.
T. H. Lowry's scheme of taking her to the Tetrarch,
Major McCalmont’s wonderful flea-bitten grey, has
temporarily fallen through, and she is to stay on in
Australia. However, she may visit the Irish sire
later in her career.

Now that Ernest Barry’s trip to Aus-
tralia is practically certain, the comparison between
him and Hanlan of old is quite confirmed. The
perfection of Barry’s sculling method earned him
the title of “the English Hanlan” when he won
his championship. An Australian won it from him,
even as Beach won it from Hanlan. And now he is
coming to Australia with the hope of regaining it, as
Hanlan did in the long ago.
* * * *
“Silas”: It may come as a surprise to
one family of Australians to hear that the bones
of Carbine have only just been shipped away to
Melbourne, and will not reach this country for
some weeks. About eight months ago I was drift-
ing round the Melbourne Museum, when I encoun-
tered a voluble oat-farmer, his wife and brood,
and I tacked on for the sake of the edification which
Hay Whiskers provided. He knew a little about
everything, and was willing to impart all he did
not know. Presently he came to a set of bones —
or spurious imitations —and began: “Look, them
is the skellington of Carbine. He was the greatest
racehorse ever run, and I once won seven-and-six
on him. He won the Melbin Cup five times, and
then he was sold to the King of England for 50
thousan’ pounds. You can see by the bones of him
what a horse he was. There’s a backbone for yeh,
strong as a nelephant. And look at the head—you
don’t see horses with ’eads like that nowadays.
Carbine’s skellington has been put here as a model
for other horses to go and do likewise, and yous
kids orter remember it.” Then Whisks passed on,
and I fished out the tab on the big toe of one
leg of those holy bones, and read: “Dinosaur
(Iguanodon bernissartensis), extinct mesozoic reptile.’'

John Baxter, known on every bowling-
green in the Ma State, went west a week ago,
aged 74. He was formerly one of the heads in the
Customs. Included in his large brood was Maggie
Baxter, who distinguished herself in London jour-
nalism.

Even the bowler is becoming lugubrious
owing to the price of his playthings. Second-hand
bowls are now fetching £6 or £7 a pair, and the
price of a new set makes even the wealthy tremble.
The Excellite, which were most popular, are now
off the market. Wooden bowls before the war were
made from lignum-vitae, which was worth £l4 a
ton. It is said to be now ten times that much.
Australian hardwoods have been found suitable for
almost any class of work, and he will be a benefactor
to many estimable old gentlemen who will find a
wood here from which a bowl can be satisfactorily
turned.
“047” : The Digger had no use for the feudal
idea. One of the many who went to Scotland was
trying his luck in a salmon river when the keener
came along and said “You mustn’t fish here. These
waters belong to his Lordship.” “Righto,” yawned
the Digger, withdrawing his rod and commencing to
read. Returning an hour later, the keeper found
fishing had re-commcnced, and he was furious. “Didn’t
I tell vou,” he said, “that these waters belonged to
his Lordship?” “Look here, old sport,” Dig.
answered ; “your Lordship’s lot went by an hour ago.
The doesn’t own all the water of the
world, vou know.”

A talent for the game runs in families
in many cases, but no other two brothers in the
world ever played such billiards as the Lindrums
plaved in Melbourne this last week or two. Young
Walter, in particular, was a record-breaker as
regards breaks in which the “Gray stroke” is
avoided and the player specialises in rapid top-of-the-
table play. yet brother Fred was never far behind
the left-hander, and both of them looked good
enough to compete for the championship in England.
Talking of the Gray stroke, who thinks about it
now? Not only the mechanical monotony, but the
slowness of it, soon wearied onlookers for whom it
was no longer a novelty.
THE POINT HE’D OVERLOOKED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The jockey boy declared The Roo
The finest nag he’d ever straddled.
No galloper as swift and true
As this big roan had yet been saddled.
“He clears his hurdles like a bird;
lie’ll carry any weight they give him.
And distance doesn’t count,” I heard—
“ There’s not a runner can outlive him.
‘He’s got the blood, he’s got the bone,
And Carbine was his great-grandfather,
His times in private stand alone.
Could he romp in ahead? Well, rather!
An eight-foot wall he’ll gaily climb ;
And, though we don’t tell all the people,
lie’s covered in flat-racing time
The distance of to-morrow’s Steeple.”
Of course I backed The Roo at that.
1 pawned my watch, I sold my braces,
And went expectant to the flat,
And came a ruin from the races.
The jockey said: “It isn’t true?
You backed him ! You deserve to rue it.
I told you all that he could do—
I didn’t say we’d let him do it!”

The G.-G. and Lady Helen, shadowed by
genthelp Clifford, have been visiting the
widow of Admiral Bridges at Trawalla,
which, by the way, is for sale.
Lieut.-Governor Irvine and family have
gone to the Government shack at Macedon
for the period of the law courts vacation
and possibly a week or two longer. It is
said that the Dame is delighted with the old
Syme cottage, as improved by the State, and
its surroundings. Hopetoun, when State
Governor, preferred Woodlands, in the Ararat
district, and rented it for a couple of
seasons.
Gaud-Mayor Aikman gave a send-off to
Peter Mcßride, the Agent-General, who is to
leave on his return to London on December
31. Arthur Robinson, who is about to visit
London himself, backed up Aikman in de-
scribing Peter as the very man for his job;
but perhaps the finest tribute of all was that
of L. A. Adamson, headmaster of Wesley,
who said that the invariable story of re-
turned soldiers was that if a man in diffi-
culties wanted anything reasonable done
Mcßride was the one to work the oracle.
The occasion was seized by Peter to rub
it in that tens of thousands of the best of
Britishers —people ready to pay their own
way—were prepared to come to Australia
if Australia would open its arms to receive
and settle them.
Portsea is to be the social Mecca this
Christmas. The Goodalls have already gone
down, and others of the Best have grabbed
every available villa. The family bill-payers
had better tune up their nerves with sea-
bathing. Nineteen guineas for a bathing-
dress is quite a common extravagance.
The Jqpk Baillieus (she was the youngest
daughter of the late John Madden) are
headed for Australia, home and comfort.
They are expected back from England any
day now.
The Naval and Military Club (officahs
only, y’know) is shifting camp. It moves
out from its quarters in Collins-street in
February and goes into the old German
Club. This is a big building off Collins-
street, near the Melbourne Club. Members
are planning a great housewarming, with a
ball, during Newmarket week.
The Norman Brookes pair are rebuilding
Bowdon, in South Yarra, near the Botani-
cal Gardens, and will move in soon. Bow-
don, which has done duty for years as a
hash-house, stands in part of the ground
that was old Fitzgerald’s wonderful garden.
Some of the trees of Fitzgerald’s day are
stil] there.
Brig.-Gen. Wheatley, who married Esther
Fairbairn, intends to settle in Australia.
He and his wife are off to England to arrange
his affairs there.
Millicent Staugliton, the young daughter
of Mrs. Bob, has been doing a star turn at
tennis. She won the tournament prize at
the Leslie Stuarts’ summer party.
A scion of the old French nobility, Felix
de Ricquebourg de Boisee, passed but the
other day at West Melbourne. His demise
brought back recollections of the day of the
great welcome in Melbourne to General Pau
and the French Mission. Little Antoinette,
daughter of de Boisee, a State-school pupil,
whose discovery was regarded as a triumph
by the Education Department, read an ad-
dress in French from her fellow 200,000
scholars. The first few words revealed to
the General a. compatriot, and when she con-
cluded he lifted her up and kissed her. It
was Antoinette’s crowded hour.
As member for Castlemaine Lawson got
the better of the Premier of Victoria on
Thursday, and slipped away to Ms con-
stituency to attend the annual break-up of
the State High School. It was a sort of
contest of Love v. Duty, and Love won.
Unfortunately the motor-car which w r as to
have brought him back to Parliament House
at 1 o’clock on Friday morning (there was
an all-night sitting on the Estimates! broke
down, and he was delayed for nearly five
hours. How like a motor-car! When he got
back he found the House exactly where he
left it, a go-slow policy having been adopted
as a protest against no-increase-of-pay-for
members. Lawson put his back up and won
after the House had sat 39i hours.
John Thornton, a veteran Western Dis-
trict squatter, went further west last week at
his place near Camperdown. Though past
85, he showed few visible signs of age until
about three months ago. His elder daughter
is the wife of General Harold Grimwade.
The younger married a son of Justice Hood.
Dr. Clendinnen, the radium specialist,
recently lost a rather expensive law case in
which damages were given against him in
favor of a.patient who alleged unsatisfactory
treatment. In the eyes of sawbones at large,
Clendinnen had three points in his favor:
(1) that radium-treatment is not put for-
ward as a certain cure for any disorder;
(2) that the patient was back at work when
the case came to trial; (3) that Clendinnen
had established a notable record in the prac-
tice of a difficult and obscure branch of medi-
cal science. The profesh in Melbourne is
now airing its dinner-togs w T ith the intention
of asking him to a sympathetic meal, at
which the feet of the city’s front-rank men
will be under the groaning board in large
numbers.
Melbourne’s latest car mystery has sur-
rounded a six-cylinder of Harold Newbigin,
who served as a horse-colonel in Egypt. He
left his chariot outside Menzies’ one even-
ing, and it didn’t wait for him. “Nothing’s
too good for the soldiers,” of course; so
perhaps the motor-pirate thought he was
doing his bit for Newbigin by removing the
£5OO vehicle and giving him a chance to buy
an 8-cylinder remount at £750.
Owing to the illness of Father Sullivan,
the rector, there was no break-up ceremony
at Xavier’s this Christmas.
The Mother Rpctress of St. Vincent’s
Hospital is up in arms against an allegation
that the hospital is a “proselytising shop.”
A goodly crowd of non-Catholic patients who
have passed through St. Vincent’s in 25
years could testify that nobody tried to lure
them into the Church of Rome whilst they
were getting treatment. Goodness only
knows what Dr. Kent Hughes was thinking
of if he said what he is said to have said !
Everybody knows that the hospital at East
Melbourne has the best of names as a
receptacle for the sick and a training-school
for nurses, and if the proportion of R.C.’s
among the patients is larger than the propor-
tion of Catholics in the population of Mel-
bourne, it is because they rush the beds. Had
none of them been non-Catholics the hospital
would not be less of a charitable institution
than public hospitals where Protestants pre-
dominate, and where patten's in a position
to pay something are gojuUy requested to
shell out. People of Mother Rectress’s reli-
gious persuasion don’t go and fall sick in
order to get doctored at St. Vincent’s. So
the Government grant would be deserved if
St. Vincent’s catered for R.C.’s only.
Incidentally the Mother Rectress got in
one neat counter, quoting what Hughes had
said when he was a member of the hospital
staff some years ago. Then he had “never
met a patient who had peen troubled about
his or her religion while in hospital,” and
“the love of two rabid Protestants, whom he
had treated, knew no bounds when they left
cured.” Hughes wriggled by professing to
thank the Rectress for proving how fair he
was. Rut it didn’t prove him fair. It only
proved him versatile.
This is Muriel Pornett, a clever Mel
bourne girl who is commercialising a gift
as a fanciful illus-
trat o r. Mullen:
have just published
one of her quaint-
est performances,
“Mia Mia Mites,”
and the plump
brown babies tod-
dling through its
pages will till the
eyes and stir the
souls of many kid-
dies this Christ-
mas. Though a Vic-
torian, Muriel first
smelt paint undei
H. P. Gill and J.
Ashton in Adelaide,
and responded suc-
cessfully to the latter's teaching by winning
a couple of medals, one of which came from
the London Drawing Society. The water-
color that won this reward was hung in the
June (1917) Exhibition at Buckingham
Palace. Later on another water-color was
sent to London, but a Hun torpedo let in
the ocean, and a lot of the scenery was
washed out of the frame, .leaving behind a
Cubist view of Berlin in a bilious attack.
Mrs. Monty Grover, wife of the Sydney
Sunday Sun editor and sister of A 7 iolet
Varlcy, of delectable memory, has been trip-
ping round this village saying farewells and
receiving tea parties prior to going to Lon-
don with Montague, who is to join the Sun
and Melbourne Herald cable service.
Loaded with gifts and good wishes J. G.
Campbell, headmaster of Spring-road State
School, Malvern, retired last week after close
on half a. century’s service. It was about up
to parents, former students and present
pupils to demonstrate in Campbell’s favor,
for he was mainly instrumental in training
scores of winners of scholarships. It was
considered bad form to attend his school and
be a dunce.
Beryl Fitts is spending this winter in the
south of France with Mr. and Mrs. George
Armstrong and the Melba grandchild. Beryl's
father has just arrived in Melbourne with
soldier son Russell.”
Kathleen Macpherson Knox pushed off her
lone canoe for England last week. Divorced
hubby is still on transport work.
Beatrice Henty, Vic. superintendent of the
Australian Comforts Fund, is wearing a
diamond lace-pin, presented by her admir-
ing army of helpers. Incidentally, Miss M.
Falconer, the hon. sec. in Melbourne, has
received a diamond and aquamarine pin
from her fellow-workers.
Melbourne’s best dresser, Mrs. George
Chirnside, slid away by the Morea for Lon-
don to see daughter Mrs. Harold Pape. The
voyager promises to be back in the autumn.
Singer Harry Dearth has also a bunk in the
Morea.
Passed out in England last week, Charles
Money, a contemporary of Adam Lindsay
Gordon at the Yorick Club. An old Etonian
and British Army officer, he drifted to
Maoriland on a health trip, and soon after
saw service in the Maori War. Later
he came to Melbourne, where lie married a
daughter of the late Captain and Mrs. Gran-
tham, of Flinders. Soon afterwards he and
his wife returned to England. Old Mel-
bourne friends with whom Mr. Money never
lost touch were George Gordon McCrae and
“Chinese” Morrison.
Medical-Colonel Maudsley’s tall wife, with
daughter and soldier son, got back last week.
The Maudsley dame’s hair has greyed dur-
ing the war years, but she is thinking of
picking up her golf clubs again.
Adelaide’s weekly tea-party :—
The St. Peter’s v. Prince Alfred College cricket
match attracted the usual crowd, with a large sprink-
ling of returned “old boys.” In deference to the
wish of his Ex., expressions of the rivalry between
the colleges were sternly suppressed on the opening
day, the perfect young gentlemen even being coerced
into cheering their opponents. But next day they
were themselves, and old scholars with reminiscent
grins gleefully encouraged the usual scrambling fight
among the boys and applauded the usual vain rush
of headmasters and the good-humored police inter-
ference.
Adelaide’s first “Lady Mayoress” (Mrs. C. R. J.
Clover) devoted her last official day to entertaining
the presswomen of Adelaide at her home. She is a
very popular dame. Her successor, Mrs. F. A.
Moulden, is taking a lead in the French Red Cross
appeal.
Passed out this week, G. F. Hussey, a very popu-
lar member of the Stock Exchange, and Charles
Ulysses Bagot, at one time warden of the Peake
goldfields and lately of the Lands Titles Office.
Major Jim Strachan and his English bride have
been welcomed home by a crowd of friends. He
is the only surviving son of the Roland Strachans.
Captain W. L. Strachan, who married Alice Campbell,
fell at Gallipoli.
People living on the higher levels of this city
had a cheerful experience in the recent heat-wave,
when owners of motors and traps had to load up
with tubs and casks and cart water for household
purposes from their luckier neighbors oh the lower
levels.
Mrs. George Bagot blushed at a genuine tribute
last week. Some grateful Diggers put in print their
appreciation of all she has done for the Keswick
Hospital patients since the beginning of the war.
Being as modest as she is popular she will strafe
her admirers heartily for their bouquet.
Ivy Turton, a popular Westralian contralto, has
sailed for Europe, where she intends studying for
grand opera. The Gold State has not yet produced
a G.O. singer, but a London Academy of Music
examiner, when visiting Westralia, declared that
Ivy is practically certain of success—all she needs
is “tradition and experience.” Besides a fine voice
she has good looks and a capacity for hard work.
Eighty-year-old Mrs. Tamblyn, who had a funeral
here the other day, was the first white woman to
arrive at Wallaroo, and she lived thereafter in the
vicinity of the mines for nearly 60 years.
Professor Watson, brilliant surgeon and staunch
friend, announced his retirement from the University
at Commemoration. “Wattie” served in both the S.
African and the world war, and there are more yarns
woven round him than around any other medico in
S.A.
Widower Roy Davidson is trying his luck a second
time with pretty war-widow Jackson. Both are
young, rich, and had tragically short periods of
married bliss.
Captain Ashcroft was married last week
to Myra Nathan, daughter of the rich fur-
niture-man. The wedding was at Men-
zies’, and as the bride is one of the most
conspicuous smart frockers in Melbourne,
there was a fine parade of clothes. And then
the bride must go and sprain her ankle,
so that she is spending her honeymoon
among cushions, nurses and bandages.
The marriage of pretty Reay Forbes and
Stanley Dobson was fixed for Monday of this
week at Christ Church, South Yarra. Stanley
lately cast aside his war-worn khaki and
resumed his barrister’s gown. He is follow-
ing in the legal footsteps of his late father.
who was one of the Hobart Dobson clan.
His mother was a Hopkins, sister of the
Sam Staughton widow.
Charlie Kelly, out of khaki, and back at
the family sheep-plantation in the Western
District, has persuaded one' of the pretty
little Wee Waa Affleck girls to make an altar
appointment with him.
One day last week Dr. Mitchell O’Sul-
livan, only son of Dr. O’Sullivan, of Rich-
mond, married Mamie Colville at Christ
Church, St. Kilda. The bride floated along
in white georgette over silver tissue with a
court train of white brocade. A small cousin
kept it out of the dust. Her mother’s wed-
ding veil was clamped to her snowy brow
with silver leaves, and she hugged a sheaf
of lilies on one arm like Rossetti’s Blessed
Damozel. Mavis Ellery bridesmaided in
mauve cr§pe de chine and a black tulle hat.
Major Ray Torell helped his cousin the
bridegroom through his ordeal. Only rela-
tions and a friend or two were bidden to
the wedding tea given by the bride’s parents
at Chatton, St. Kilda-road. The doctor and
his bride will settle at Casterton, where he
has screwed up his brass plate.
Edyth Harrhy (Mrs. Con Beckx Daly)
is the English bride of a well-known Mel-
bourne officer who is
now having his
wounds patched up
after long service in
the A.I.E 1 . The lady is
a composer of note
in England, where
she has been “sung”
by numerous Voices.
She commenced her
studies at the age of
six, and her first
honors came from
Trinity College, Lon-
don, just before her
7th birthday. Fol-
lowing this achieve-
ment she gained four
scholarships at the
Guildhall, her studies
being under Landon
Ronald. One scholarship she gave up in
order to tour Australia and Africa with
violinist Mary Law. Already Allan’s have
published “The Bells Across the Moor” and
“A Virginian Love Song,” and at his recent
concert Kirby sang some of her work from
MSS. which is to be published shortly.
Dolly Castles Finn (she married Dr.
Finn) is the proud mother of a daughter.
So Amy Castles answers to “Auntie” for the
first time. Amy has gone to Sydney to em-
bark for Maoriland.
Mrs. Alice Rees-Vogrich has presented
Professor Laver, of the Uni. Conservatorium,
with the ivory baton of Franz Liszt. The
gold-mounted bauble was given iu Weimar
to Madaine’s late husband, Max Vogrich,
when his opera “Buddha” was produced.
The gift doesn’t diminish the German atmos-
phere of the place with which Prof. Laver
is connected.
Tenor Kirby has gone to Sydney for a
change and will probably cross to Maoriland
for tw r o or three weeks.
Artist Tom Roberts, back in Melbourne
after many years, is now furnished with a
beautiful pointed beard, a la Lambert, bur
is thinner than when he was last here, His
brother-artists consider that after a long
spell of rationing he needs a square meal,
and energetic John Shirlow is making
arrangements for him to get one, accom-
panied by the usual oratory. Another brush-
brother, Charlie Wheeler, who acquired a
D.C.M. while helping to rearrange the land-
scape of Europe, returned by the same boat.
Ida Rentoul Outhwaite is off to England
with a box or two of book material for
English publishers.
National Gallery students had a fancy-
dress affair in the Stawell Gallery last week.
The show was largely attended by artists,
and even Bernard Ilail dropped in with his
wife. Tom Roberts, back from England,
hid his grey cranium in a comic headpiece;
Frank Crozier, stiff in khaki, almost suc-
ceeded in pretending to be a demobilised
general; W. J. McNally, the landscape artist,
brought the flavor of the butter business into
his pretty speeches, and W. Montgomery of
the Vic. Artists, strolled about wrapped in
an incomparable air of felicity. Artist Mary
Allen was the hit of the evening as a Per-
sian lady, and Esther Paterson’s get-up as
a cover design for Vogue made that maga.
seem dowdy. Marion Jones, the Gallery
scholarship-winner, was also noticeable, par-
tially disguised as Madge Fabian in
“Romance.”
Artist Colin Colahan damaged himself
considerably in his recent sensational col-
lapse in Max Meldrum’s studio. After
being patched up, he is to be sent off to
K ; ng Island to restore his nerves with a
12-months’ loaf.
One of the Tait brethren, William, who
was not associated with the high kick and
greasepaint industry, went west from Cam-
berwell the other day. Until a few years
ago, when he retired, he held a billet at the
G.P.O.

The hot weather brought the trouble
among the women painters to a head last
week, and the end-of-the-year meeting was
a free-to-all. Almost since the commence-
ment the artistic side of the club was some-
thing that could only be guessed at —like the
family skeleton, it was never paraded. Every
afternoon the social side revelled in the
grey-clad rooms, and one by one the painting
women dropped out, until finally at the dance
the other week not a blessed palette was
represented. Now the camp has split, the
women with the brush sticking to Mrs. Sher-
wood and Mrs. Parsons, while the revellers
form the other faction. And the question
of which woman is to fill the place left vacant
amid the Art Gallery Trustees remains un-
answered. llow the old cynic whose chair
is to be filled would have chuckled over it all!
The Baby Welfarers thrust an expensively-
gloved hand at Dr. Truby King, his wife
and the experimental daughter at King's
Hall last week. His Ex. and Lady David-
son, finding the one train fare would cover
the prize-givings in the afternoon and this
reception in the evening, were present; she,
in spite of the humidity and the mosquitoes,
pink and white rising from a sheathing of
black silkincss; he beaming with childlike
satisfaction as he propounded a riddle in
arithmetic to the rosy-cheeked, liealthy-eyed
Truby King flapper, who responded, with the
cheerful indifference of one whose dad con-
temns home-lessons, that she didn’t know —
wasn’t a bit good aj; figures. Mrs. Truby
in black melted into the background; and
the doctor made himself the small boys’
candidate for life by proclaiming a platform
of less study and more play.
Marjorie Innes-Noad, in black and silver
and lots of tulle, helped Dad the President
make the party a success. Mrs. Mary Irvine
soothed conflicting elements in an American
model that suggested moonrise; Ruth Beale
in blue pompadour brocade brought a pretty
young sister and the problem of the house-
hold assistant with her ; Mrs. Earp did credit
to the woes of Poland in gold brocade; Dr.
Bean and his sister were there, vainly seek-
ing a vegetarian drink; and Mrs. Holman
soothed herself in the calm of the vice-regal
party after her storm amidst the artists in
the afternoon. The Newfoundland atmos-
phere surrounding Dame Margaret is cooling
even on a December night; and gentle, not
to say drooping, gent-help Allison is a rest-
cure in himself. Dr. Margaret Harper, all
the child specialists in Sydney, a strong
Stars-and-Stripes contingent, Miss Arm-
strong with her London information bureau
in full talking order, not forgetting the
young woman who had evidently stepped in
on her way to the surf in a dull blue silk
kimono garment and her hair strapped
securely on to her head —they all took music
and tea or coffee in an atmosphere of milky
kindness.
The definite assurance that the Prince of
Wales is coming to Australia early in 1920
is certain to cause a rush of absentees to
the Commonwealth. The social obscurity in
England of many wealthy and well-known
Australians is remarkable. Some give up
the apparently hopeless struggle and return,
in the philosophic spirit of the matron who
sold her Grosvenor-square house for the price
of an old song and abandoned Albion for ever,
remarking: “It’s better to be somebody in
Collins-street than nobody in Piccadilly.”
Others fight on, collecting friends (meaning
prominent people who are willing to .be fed
by them) in the same way as boys collect
postage-stamps or beetles. By the time their
children grow up thev may have a more or
less valuable assortment. The Prince would,
of course, represent a priceless specimen from
the London standpoint, where he is naturally
many times harder to corner than he would be
abroad. A station-owning family who could
get him to stay with them would have an
indisputable lien on him for dances and even
dinners when they returned to England. A
lot might be done with him in the clubs by
fathers and brothers doggedly determined to
do the best work possible for their families’
“advancement.” The members of his suite
will also be worth adding to the albums of all
true collectors. Climbers are barred from
travelling by sea with him and his friends by
the precaution which confines such tourists
to either a battleship or a privately-chartered
finer. But once he lands the arena will be
free practically to all. The Royal martyr
will be at the mercy, so to speak, of the
lions and lionesses.
Daisy Kennedy and Topsie Doenau are off
to Maoriland with the Amati and the grand
piano tucked under their arms. What will
the Outer Rim think of Daisy’s dressing?
At one of her afternoon concerts she wore
the blue-green of the peacock with a gold-
tissue cape strung across the shoulders, an
Oriental hip scarf of many colors knotted
loosely in the front and falling almost to the
hem of her garment—reminiscent, rather, of
an old Biblical picture of the Woman of
Samaria.
That brave Maorilander, Ettie Rout, is
still in France. Her work in Paris being
finished, she transferred to Villers-Breton-
neux, where the Diggers came in and
checked the great grey wave that threatened
all the world. In her present effort she
owes most to the American Red Cross,
which equipment for the Soldiers’
Club which she set up in the big village, and
a quantity of provisions, including a very
precious 10 tons of condensed milk; and
the mayor handed over the wreck of a
building that once was a school.
What has risen out of the wreck is more
than a Soldiers’ Club; for hundreds of
children from this devastated Somme are
cared for so far as means permit. And
there are others to care for. Miss Rout
writes:—-
I have seen sorrowing mothers and forlorn sweet-
hearts searching for miles for one dear cross, finding
it, and then, uplifted at least with that spiritual
consolation, waiting wearily, hour after hour, on the
roadside for a passing lorry to bring them back.
And, like vultures and ghouls, there is gathering
a sordid army of calamity vVhich is planning to
make “a good thing” out of the accommodation and
transport of mothers and wives and sweethearts who
have scraped and saved the cost and endured the toil
of travelling thousands of miles to enter this Temple
of the Dead.
Miss Rout’s idea is that there should be a
more or less permanent hostel and an organ-
ised transport of volunteer Australian and
M.L. owner-drivers.
From the cemeteries and solitary graves
her children have gathered for her pods of
the poppies with which Nature has sprinkled
the country as with teardrops. “I am
sending parcels of these,” Miss Rout says,
“to the curators of the Melbourne and
Christchurch gardens, with the request that,
those who have lost relatives may be given
a few of the seeds.”
The gii’l who is looking so soulfully at the
next column is Rene Maxwell, who, so the
cables recently announced, is to return to
Australia this month, after securing the Knill
Challenge Cup from the London Guildhall
School of Music. Rend left Australia in 1914
to study at the Guildhall. From the start
she won prizes,
sch o 1 a rships and
medals. During the
•war she made fre-
quent appearances at
thb Aussie camps in
England, and never
hesitated to put off
a payable profes-
sional engagement
for a buckshee sing-
song with the Dig-
g e r s. Her flat in
Maida Yale was the
rendezvous of Dig-
gers on furlough, and
her farewell concert
in London (it hap-
pened in October)
crowded the Wig-
more Hall. The
programme included seven of Ida Rentoul’s
Bush Songs, in which Ren6 has specialised,
and a song written for her by Edward lies,
of the Guildhall School. Vernon Sellars, a
Digger baritone who has been studying in
London since the Armistice and for whom
the critics predict a future, made his debut
at the same concert. He and Ren6 are to duet
in Sydney Town Hall early in 1920. Co.vn,
director of the Antwerp Opera, pays the
Australian girl this 18-carat compliment:
“She sings the Jewel Song from ‘Faust’
better than any singer I have ever heard —
and I have heard them all.” He hasn’t, of
course. Still, you know what he means.
To the tick of the clock, and overflowing
the decorated lorries, they drove up to the
side-entrance to Farmers’, and on the vacant
lot of land that was once Roberts’ Hotel,
the tiny guests found a long, gaily-flagged
tent with a stage at the end, on to which
presently Charlie Chaplin walked to say
how-d’-you-do ? Even the smallest pink bow
recognised him, and cried a welcome. Then
there were two little girls all the way from
Ireland who danced a jig in Connemara red
and emerald green; and a clown who did
the funniest things; and a large doll that
came to life and danced when the clown
wound her up. It was great Ifun—
especially when a little negro minstrel
jumped from the box the clown dropped on
the stage and commenced a coon song. After
that it was time to clap and sing “Rule
Britannia” and then the real party corn-
menced. “Tea sets?’’ queried one little blue-
bow from teacher as she made her way to
the tent where the Christmas tree grew.
“They’ll be real toys” said another —“won’t
they?” So they passed on to where drawn
up to baby tables were the baby chairs; and
in the middle of the tent on a high stand
stood the cake with lots of candles
burning around it. Presently Mrs. Hol-
man, with a tomato-red veil flowing from her
hat, bade the children behold her cut the
cake, while the camera-man snapped the ex-
pectant faces. But Farver Crissimus, all in
red with snow-white whiskers, was the per-
son of importance. The little tot in the
blue-paper frock held his hand quite con-
fidentially for a moment and whispered
something—a message about Christmas Eve.
Then small girls and boys settled down to
drink large quantities of lemonade and
orangeade, while the grown-ups re-filled
glasses and plates. The party went one
better than the Vatican, and produced
two Popes; manager-of-the-Children’s-Depart-
ment Corbett enjoyed the fun more than the
smallest boy present; and the Chalmers
girls and welfare-worker Miss Hinder
helped to pass the cakes.
This is a Kenelm
Stump picture of
Gwen Nelson, who
has been chosen by
American artist
Julien Ollendorffe to
do the Sun Sprite
dance in the ballet he
is arranging for a
large and wonder-
ful Path 6 Brothers’
him. Gwen is pro-
digiously elated over
her success, as the
New Yorker’s choice
fell upon her in pre-
ference to dozens of
better-known dancing
girls. Besides, she
will be working with
Ruth St. Dennis and
two famous French dancers, and the Syd-
ney girl expects to learn a lot ffom the
association. The latest menu of the vast
Hippodrome was another source of wonder
to her when she wrote. On the one bill
appear Tetrazzini, John McCormack, Mischa
Elman and Alma Gluck, with a 300-strong
chorus! She says she’s as full of musio as
a pianola by the end of a performance.
Present visitors to Sydney include the
Marselis Parsons family—father, mother and
son—of New York. The cheery, breezy
leader of the expedition is head of the Par-
sons Bros. Trading Co., which, among other
things, supplies the paper on which 10,000
presses daily print 10,000 plans of how the
world can save itself.
His Ex. and Lady Davidson invited the
patients from the Mill and the Exeter Red
Cross Home to play a cricket match at Hill-
view, Sutton Forest. The Mill men won the
game—and, incidentally, a silver cup pre-
sented by Mrs. White. Lady Davidson cir-
culated tea among the teams and a large
congregation of friends.
One day last week the Arthur Eedys (he’s
of the Mutual Life and Citizens’) summoned
nearly 200 guests to the grounds of Loch
Maree, their delightfully-placed Vaucluse
home. Loch Maree is the sort of house the
Parisian speaks of as “bijou,” but the gar-
dens would baffle even the ready eloquence
of a Frenchman. The party was an au
revoir, for the Eedys leave for England by
the Orsova, and a welcome to Lt.-Col. and
Mrs. Clark —this warrior has just re-
turned after four years’ service with the
30th Battalion. The season’s school
prize-givings recall that Arthur Eedy was
the first dux of Sydney Boys’ High in dfeys
when it had two junior masters with other
things already in view—-one A. B. Pidding-
ton, now of the Interstate Commission; the
other Major-General Legge, soldier and
lawyer, too.
May Rawlings, who raised her voice in
song at the Truby King reception, is a pro-
mising Conservatorfum student and a
daughter of the new manager of Anthony
Hordern’s. Tall father and grey-frocked
mother were among those who sat con-
tentedly listening to the liquid notes.
Armidale has been lifting its hat to the
15-year-old mitre of R.Q, Bishop O’Connor,
and watching Papal-delegate Cattaneo bless
a new cathedral. On his tour Cattaneo suf-
fered all the usual receptions and garden
parties; and at Tamworth Mrs. Charles
Regan threw her house and oars into the
scale.
Ara Fitzgerald, daughter of Minister J. D.,
has arrived in London with her Italian
honors thick upon her and a sheaf of flatter-
ing criticisms in her Saratoga. Her first
gift in England was an engagement-ring
from tenor John Clarke, who has been fight-
ing with the British artillery in Italy. Since
then he has sung in opera in Dublin and
in Messager’s new “Monsieur Beaucaire,”
this year’s London success. The love-birds
are meditating flight to America, and wiil
hover over the States picking up some of the
golden grains that have been scattered for
them. Ara intends shortly to visit dad and
her native heath.
Mention of Minister J. D. Fitzgerald re-
calls that last week Dr. Fox, the recal-
citrant medico who wouldn’t wear a Fitz-
gerald ’flu-mask and was sent to Long Bay
in consequence, recovered £l5O by way of
damages for wrongful arrest and so on, the
High Court having pronounced the masking
regulation illegal.
Young Leonard Keep is engaged to Helen
Chisholm. Her father is a brother of Harry
Chisholm, but the two families don’t fore-
gather to any great extent.
Sydney Grammar lost, at the end of this
term, one of its oldest institutions —
Mcßurney, who for 35 years has taught suc-
ceeding generations that twice two are four
and perhaps five if you get up early enough
in the morning.
Willie Kelly has been entertaining his
friends at a cottage which he has taken near
iUeujow. He really is less robust than might
be wished. An attack of influenza which he
had in Melbourne affected his heart and
knocked him about otherwise. In the early
part of next year he is going to America.
General Legge is coming to Sydney
shortly to lecture, under the auspices of the
Australian Aero Club, on “Aviation in Aus-
tralia.” Meanwhile Colonel “Toby” Watt
is going to Melbourne to take charge of the
A.F.C. contingent which is turning out in
honor of Captain Ross Smith. The winner
of the big prize wa? in Colonel Watt's
squadron in Egypt.
The Ernest Watts are leaving England on
a visit to Australia in February. She was
Bertha Brady, elder daughter of the throat-
specialist, and she hasn’t seen her parents
since some time before the war began.
The committee of the Bush Book Club
offers a prize for the best-earried-out set of
characters from a book. Then there’s to be
a prize for the most popular set, and prizes
for individual book characters. Barbara
Knox is organising the sets; if you intend
to form one drop a note to her at Ronii,
Bellevue Hill.
The Jumble Depcjt wants men’s clothes
more than anything else, and it says “Please,
no matter how old or worn.” 40 Burton-
street, Darlinghurst.
Here’s a cooee from Camperdown. where
the sick little ones lie in the Royal Alex-
andra Hospital. Secretary Moss asks for
toys or funds to buy toys to make the
Christmas a “merry one” for the little suf-
ferers. There’ll be great doings among the
cots on Christmas morning whep the stock-
ings are opened. Wouldn’t you like to be
in it? You’ll have to hurry.
The blinded soldiers have opened their
tea shop in Pitt-street. All blues and browns
and scrupulously clean. The Fuller lady
pronounced the benediction a few mornings
ago, and on the spot gave a permanent order
for the household weekly half-pound. Muir-
head Collins sat basking in ‘the splendor of
his title; he’s visiting our own knighted
Alexander the Surgeon. Eadith Walker, in
neatly-cut serge, brought Heaven-alone-
knows-what practical blessings in her hand-
bag, and Mrs. Gordon Wesche, Miss Egan.
Mrs. Floyd, Mr. Helsham and Mr. Blythe
were others who gave a God-speed.
Here’s something for the business-girl—
you can take your own sandwich with you
and just buy your pot of tea. The teasbop
won’t mind. In fact, it rather likes that
plan.
A feature of St. Aloysius’ break-up theatri-
cals was the staging of the show out in the
grounds; and as the play dealt with the
summary ways of the Roman with the early
Christian, the boulders add rocky projections
of the background (part of the courts have
been cut out of rock) formed a ripping Cata-
combs scene. Moonlight and lantern added
to the illusion —broken only by the yell of
Philistine laughter that greeted the touch
of feeling which dad Nemesius put into his
embrace of Claudia, a lower-form chap all
pink and white and golden wig. Morgan
O’Neill, president of the Old Boys’ Union,
handed out the prizes.
Celia Ghiloni was granted a restitution
order last week in Sydney. She married
Ronald Macpherson, whom she had met
on board ship, 10 years ago. He was then
an engineer and explorer and several other
things. The smiling, good-natured comedi-
enne assured her friends that at last she had
unearthed “the love of her life.” Then he
went into the picture business and she began
acting again; he went to the war, and she
continued to act; and suddenly, with little
or no warning, the lamp of his affection blew
right out.
Sydney High School invoked the aid of
Will Shakspeare’s “Tempest” and “Taming
of the Shrew” to help fill the shelves of the
school library. The Repertory was packed
with friends and teachers anxious to catch
the gleam of a future Irving—or Bland Holt.

ALL the COMFORTS of ELECTRICITY
WITH ENGINE POWER AS WELL!
The desire for electric light is not the only reason why thousands ot country dwellers have
this Western Electric Outfit. Power is also wanted for the farm and that’s where theWestem
Electric Outfit shines. You simply move a switch to disconnect the electric generator and
then the full power of the $y 4 h.p. Kerosene Engine is at your disposal for driving separa-
tor, churn, chaffcutter, saw bench and pump direct from the pulley or by line shafting.
Western Electric Power and Light has more than twice
the capacity of any other outfit. It has plenty of surplus
power. The Battery has a capacity of 180 Ampere Hours.
Switch the light on if you want it —as many lamps as you
like, —or keep a handy motor doing small jobs, without
fear of exhausting the battery.
The big engine bums kerosene, feeds itself with fuel and oil,
starts when you press a switch just like a motor car, stops when
the battery is charged, is air-cooled, and throttle-governed.
Why buy a small outfit that only gives light, when the Western
Electric Plant is easy to buy and pays for itself over and over
again. Write for particulars and 20 page Book post free from

Publican: Depends on how it is used.
Some time ago the N. S. Wales Department of Justice
directed the police that if a billiard-table was
kept on that portion of licensed premises reserved
for the private use of the licensee, and if friends
or acquaintances were allowed to play on it without
charge, but with the underlying object of attracting
custom to the bar, objection should be made to
the renewal of that publican's license. Probably
if the police were satisfied that the table was above
suspicion no objection • would be raised.... Corlcpop:
Right, thanks Biddy Bird: It’s hardly worth
while.... T. Condelly: “The Reward” is not good
enough. .. .Reid (can’t decipher the pen-name): It’s
derived from the Spanish name Diego. Webster, in
his definition of “Dago,” says, “a person of Spanish
(or, by extension, Portuguese or,.now most commonly,
Italian) descent”.... Sarah M.: He’s not the only
one of the kidney by a long way.... G.L.F.: If it’s a
question between writing poems and digging post-
holes, make it post-holes W.J.G.: Two of
Archibald’s old favorites... .B.J.: Dear, dear! Those
kittens that the nice girl was taking away to drown
when the miscreant robbed her of the bag are hard
to kill.... Wheatstone: That Diggers’ word “berl”
probably came from bourreler, to sting. .. .Recdbcd:
Put it into a dozen or 20 lines, and it may go. A
weary public wouldn’t read more.... Jos. T. H.: No.
W.L.C.T.: Bill is quite right. “Sawing” is not a
rhyme for “soaring.” Apart from the fact that one
contains an “r,” which must be pronounced, and
the other doesn’t, the vowel sounds are different....
Obadiah Ken: No use... .R.M.B.: None of them
quite good enough... .L.M. (Glebe Point): Doesn’t
say a word that hasn’t been better said before....
Billy S.: No, Bill—it’s thousands of miles from
“the mark” W.L.M.: At least ten thousand better
sets of verse have been written on that subject....
G.M.L. :~Now, that’s worth saying; but the manner
isn’t good O.S. (North Carlton): “Ye,” “thou,”
“thine” —how many people are you talking about?
Parthenia: Pleasant little flutter, but it couldn't
get past Mildred C.: No use Physique:
Rotten Evelyn C.: We could believe it if you
said they were written at the age of eight....
W.K.B.: Nice verse. Subject rather slight. Let’s
hear again Frank L.: “Hopinipee” merely nasty;
the other doesn’t matter L.P.J.: Don’t care for
the “Flat” Get Me: Don’t want to if you can
do no better than that. .. .Richard A.: Crude in
workmanship and idea. ... J.B.H.: “Nile Night” is
worth more brain-sweat... .A.B.N.: Not for us....
G.S. (Annandale): That has been done better be-
fore Melling: Verse thin and lumpy Scot-
ralia: Shocking Willow: Rather a feat to write
eight simple, grammatical lines which rhyme and
scan and yet say nothing at all... . Rex: Dreary....
Connel F.: Far too slight. .. .G.L.S.: Very ancient
material in very middling rhyme. . . . A.W.H.: Pre-
tentious verse of poor quality... .E.G.N.: Grandpa
did it better. .. .L.J.S. (Brisbane): Too thin....
Oxberry: Don’t want the horns and the hide. Send
us the marrow.... Bellerive: A nice, seasonable
item :-—
On guard within a robber’s den,
As the Christmas 'bells did chime,
Brooding o'er he’s boyhood
Sat a veteran of crime.
Wrapped in deep reflection
Within the evil den,
He heard not the wolfish footsteps
Of a traitor to the men.
Upon the table fell a shadow,
Followed by a ghastly thud,
From the victim’s skull did gusheth
> A weltering stream of blood.
Safe for Hell or Heaven
Cried the robber grim and bold ;
When their Christmas spree is over
They’ll be mourning for their gold.
... .Bendy: You met a girl in a boat, you liked her
and found she had a husband. Thrilling!... .Pivot:
No use... .E.W.L.: You might place it elsewhere.
... .Douglas A.: They don’t strike us... .W.M.B.:
One might do J.F.H.: Very tedious W.M.K :
There is a real romance of words, - but those ex-
amples are only Tit Bits fare C.D.C.: “Topsy-
Turvy” isn’t t.-t. enough... .M.K. (Perth): Neither
up....M.D.: “Mrs. Grundy” is too dull... .R.H.M.:
The verse hops, but doesn’t sparkle... .H.G.L.: Long
covering letters are waste of time. . . . J.S.H.: Sorry,
can’t find a use for it. . . . J.S.S.: Not enough force
or point. .. .M.K.F.: Verse breaks its neck every
now and then, and no humane poet ought to ask
verse to break its neck more than once.... B.W.
(England): Wretched... .T.O. (Darlinghurst) : Don’t
like it. Don’t know anybody who would. .. .W.S.F.:
Poor verse repeating all on the subject that has been
worn most threadbare... .H.O’D.K.: Answered be-
fore. Not up. .. .G.L.A.: Third grade.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.E.M.: Both too sketchy H. J.: You built the
Pen-and-ink Hotel on a steep slope A. J.M.: Two
gloomy drawings... .John B.: A few years’ study
may cure you. It’s no good sending us speechless
old pioneers or staring ladies. .. .A.II.: Not much
demand for agonised monstrosities... .11.R.B.: Why
the wire-netting screen between the Salvation Army
Band and the collector? The girl should be flimsily-
clad to give point to the joke. She is clothed like
a deaconess... At.McG.: The man on the milestone
isn’t supposed to be a deformed madman, but that's
what he looks like. .. .S.McL.: You’re very young
in art... .E.J.N.: Thanks for giving us first chance.
But we’d rather have the hundred-and-first. By that
time you may have learned a few things.... Arthur
S.: We always drown that brand of small boy.
All the important dailies in Maoriland
have decided that their price must be 2d. in
future—or as far into the future as mana-
gers can see. Increased cost of production
is the cause. During the war many pub-
lishers raised the selling price of their daily
sheets by a penny, but the Stab and
Herald (Auckland), and the Press, Sun
and Times (Christchurch) carried on at the
old figure. They find now they can’t do it
any longer. In Australia the proprietors
haven’t been able to come to a general agree-
ment. Age and Argus are a penny, except
on Saturdays, when they are tuppence; the
Sydney morning papers compromised at a
regular three-ha’pence; but there have been
“circumstances” which have so far stood in
the way of any definite movement at all ip
Adelaide and Brisbane.

,Vtss .SJXV7.I PRICE, a charming Rexona Qirl (from a photo, by Tesse lleggwrt).
Dear Sirs, —
My daughter, Sylvia, has used your Rexona Soap for her hair and
skin. Beyond doubt it has proved a wonderful restorer for her hair, for
since using your soap it is now long, brown and glossy. Her skin is now
beautifully clear, and as she is shortly to appear before the public as a
high-class singer, it is necessary that her skin and hair should be beyond
criticism, and I feel very grateful to Rexona for all it has done for her.
Yours very truly,
MRS. DOLBY PRICE,
“Yaralla,” Hastings Road, Botany.
GIRLS! REXONA SOAP Gives Natural
Beauty to Skin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin anil hair, which cannot be imitated, can be obtained by
regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not assert
this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Rven the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they
cannot heal and protect the skin. Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing,
antiseptic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment
of skin affections is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and
Facial Soap regularly once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and
cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples, and leave the complexion clear,
fresh and velvety. Price 1/- per tablet.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHY do you tread so softly by,
Little white girl, with your
smothered cry?
Oh, smile, and pluck ere you lightly
pass
A few happy blades of English grass!
For man’s but dust
Through Love and Trust.
And what do I care
For sun and air
Moving round
In the blossomy ground
With all the sons of the English earth;
With all the men I have loved from birth —
Cromwell, Hereward, Howard and Drake,
The men who strove for a great thought’s
sake;
Nelson’s kings of the blood-won foam
And the legions that followed Marlborough
home?
For I was a farmer’s son Outback,
And loved the sun on the homeward track.
But what care I
For field or sky,
For sheep on the hill
Or the old grey mill,
Who breathe as one with the great again
With Cromwell’s farmers and Marlborough’s
men?
* * * *
Ah, Love, come kindly through your dreams
to me
And immortality.
I fill my pipes with measures of Romance
For France. Vive! Vive la France!
Roland has heard me and the white Maid
comes
With revolution drums.
Who would be singing to a lyre of leaves
Where the lone Lachlan grieves?
Come, Heart, come closer in the lilt of Night.
Death’s but a dear delight.
The sweetest troubadours whose lips have
sung
Rest here and once were young.
* * * *
Mother mine, in the room at home,
Sighing over the books I knew,
Here I am nearer my Greece and Rome
And close to the land of Dreams-oome-True.
Listen now
As the sedges bow !
Hear and hear how the billows fall!
Ever from sea to shore they call :
“Homer, Homer, Homer lies
Somewhere under these war-cleansed skies.”
Shut the book and be here with me
Where Thought glows .white to Eternity.
Troy is over the foam-fields there
And Athens back in the keen, blue air,
And I was a student but yesterday
Watching the lights on Mosman Bay!
If man be dust
Through Love and Trust,
Shall his heart be blind
In the rain and the wind
Sleeping here where the ancient seas
Are free with the soul of Miltiades?
* * * *
Hammer and saw! These rout the foe-
man’s blade.
There is a little house I built for men
Warm in the quiet of a southern glen,
And in a place of kings, 10, I am laid!
Press lightly on my working hands, proud
dust;
0 winds that dream of Bethlehem, pass by !
Here where a Man for man once learned to
die
In faith I keep the immemorial trust.
My mates go homeward with their tools to-
night.
O wife, why weep you at the trysting gate?
Woman, be wise ! Too rich is my rich fate
Waiting with these the everlasting light.
Thus in the night as I sat alone
Through the human sigh in the she-oak’s
moan,
I heard Australia call to me
From the marvellous dust of Eternity.

ZORA CROSS.
The Stormbird.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LITTLE man, all nerve and sinew,
with the face of a fighter and the
passions of a wild cat—his brother
captains had named him the Stormbird,
because they swore that wherever he sailed
there went dirty weather. They jested, in
such places as snug bar-parlors near St.
Katherine’s Docks, about his peculiar in-
fluence over the winds of heaven—how his
mere presence in any latitude brought gale
and storm, even where storm and gale were
never wont to be; how he had never been
becalmed ; how he could not even see his re-
flection mirrored in still water because its
surface would always ruffle if he looked into
it. Wherever he went, they said, men had
to hold their hats on their heads. Beating
up Channel in the teeth of fierce gales howl-
ing out of the North Sea, a skipper would
remark to his mate, as they clung to the
mizzen shrouds, “By G—d, Paddy Denison’s
coming out o’ London River!” All the
world of English sailor-men had this kind of
jest to make of Captain Patrick Denison. It
was one of those jests that never fails of a
laugh, never grows stale, sounds humorous
from the most humorless lips that utter it.
For the point of the joke was that it seemed
to be true.
And, always, Patrick Denison was in-
volved in some stormy episode of life —some
fierce dispute with another man; some pas-
sionate affair with a woman; some uproar
with circumstance. Truly, literally, and
without exaggeration, he was in very fact a
Stormbird.
All last week a succession of tearing south-
easterly gales had whitened the coast from
Gabo to Cape Byron. Long, cresting surges
heaved in from the wild grey wastes of the
Tasman Sea, roaring and crashing against
the sandstone walls below South Head.
Driving squalls had blotted out the horizon
from the look-out at the new Macquarie
Tower, fierce rain-storms had flattened down
the seas. Dimly in the wet haze the brig
Anemone had driven by to the nor’ard past
Port Jackson, past the Coal River, past Port
Stephens, and it had not been possible to
turn her in her tracks until she was off
Smoky Cape. Then the wind veered to a
little north of east, and Captain Denison
came beating back to Sydney—cursing the
weather, cursing the Almighty, and bitterly
cursing the fact that his cargo of convicts
seemed to have preposterously brittle bones.
For there were 17 broken legs, 11 fractured
arms, three collar-bones cracked, a number
of ribs stove in, and two fractured skulls.
“Damme,” he complained to the mate, “I’m
not the sort of man ought to carry convicts.
The weather’s always against me. These
seem to be made o’ chiny.”
He danced with rage on the third day after
his arrival in port, when an official com-
munication from Governor Macquarie came
on board. Thus it was worded:—
Sydney, July 27, 1817.
Sir,
The report of the -Principal Colonial Surgeon
respecting the condition of the male convicts per
brig Anemone induces Me to suppose that some
Element of Neglect has .entered into the treatment of
these Unfortunate Persons whilst under your Charge
as Master of the transport. I therefore deem it my
Duty to make some Enquiry into the Circumstances
which have resulted in so many Severe Casualties
during the latter part of your Voyage, and 1 hereby
direct that you do attend at Government House at
10 o’clock to-morrow morning, for the purpose of
replying to such Questions as it may be necessary to
put to you.
I have the Honor to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
Lachlan Macquarik, Governor.
“G —d sink my soul in H —l, Mr. Mori-
arty—who does this sojer think he is?
Is he Heaven above, d —n his eyes, or what?
He ‘directs’ me, does he! To H—l with
him ! D —n him, I won’t go !”
“ ’Tis plain ye don’t know his Ex’lincy,
sorr,” said the mate, “or ye’d not be a-talkin’
that-a-way. Sure, I’d go, sorr, if ’twas
mesilf. He’s an obstnit man’s Macquarie.
’Tis soft talk he needs, sorr —an’ plenty of
it. He’s wan rating above the Almighty in
New South Wales. I’d go, sorr —bedad I
would! ’Tis the most advisable thing ye
could do, so it is. An’ besides, sorr, ain’t
ye wantin’ for to kape swate wid th’ Guv’nor?
Sure, ye’ve not forgotten Mistress Em’ly,
have ye, now?”
“Oh II—1!” exclaimed Captain Denison,
as he retired below, swearing.
Mrs. Emily Carson may be disposed of in
a few lines. She was very beautiful, very
voluptuous, very sensual and very criminal.
Her late husband —a di unken bully—had died
at her hands. She had shot him with a
pistol when he had attacked her and her
lover with a hatchet. Then she had robbed
him shamelessly, and run away with the
lover. Captured and tried, her beauty had
softened both jury and judge. It had also
softened the susceptible heart of the Prince
Regent, who had come to see the trial at the
Old Bailey. The death sentence had been
recorded, put aside, and transportation for
life substituted for translation to another
world. But it was well understood that a
conditional pardon would be hers in Austra-
lia, and that her return to England would
not be indefinitely postponed. In his tem-
pestuous fashion, Patrick Denison had fallen
a victim to her charms, wished to marry her,
and proposed appealing to the Governor to
permit her to return with him in the
Anemone. These things were sometimes dene.
Why not in the case of the lovely Mrs. Car-
son? He had never before been to Sydney,
and did not know Macquarie. Mr. Moriarty
continually impressed him with the fact that
his Excellency was a person to be considered.
He was almost tearful in his protests as to
the absolute necessity for such consideration.
Mr. John Thomas Campbell, the Governor’s
Secretary, was gi’eatly impressed, and maybe
a little amused, when he had the honor of
meeting Captain Patrick Denison shortly
before ten on the following morning. The
personable little man was sumptuously clad
in his most elaborate shore-going raiment.
A noble beaver top-hat added a trifle to his
stature. His neat side-whiskers were newly
trimmed. A black silk stock, a frilled shirt-
front of fine linen, a flowered waistcoat, a
grey cloth tail-coat, buckskin pantaloons,
highly-polished Wellingtons that almost
sparkled in the sun, and a gold-topped
Malacca cane combined to make him a pic-
ture of. somewhat uncomfortable el?g->nce.
An imnortant-looking bunch of seals dangled
from his fob.
“A verra proper little sea-dandy,” mut-
tered Mr. Campbell, as he closed the door
after ushering the visitor into his Excel-
lency’s office. “He’ll need all his stair-rch,
I’m thinking.” He grinned sardonically as
he re-seated himself at his table.
“Pray be seated, sir,” said Macquarie, in-
dicating a chair in front of the big table
behind which he was installed.
Captain Denison sat down, his right hand
grasping the curly brim of his hat, and sup-
porting itself upon the gold knob of the
Malacca. The Governor took up a paper
from the table and glanced at it. The little
man glared at him, savagely and expectantly.
“I am at a loss, Captain Denison, to
understand why the unfortunate prisoners
entrusted to your care should have fared so
badly. One would imagine, to look at this
return, that some person might have gone
amongst them with a bludgeon for the
especial purpose of breaking their limbs.
Can you enlighten me at all regarding the
matter?”
“Heavy gale—tremendous sea. Ship
broached to—on her beam-ends. Some fit-
tings broke loose. People tumbled about all
ways. ’S all I know.”
'He snapped the short sentences out in a
fashion that conveyed an unmistakable
admonition to Macquarie to mind his own
business. His Excellency stiffened.
“It seems to me. Captain Denison, that
sufficient provision could not have been made
to save the inmates of. the nrison on the
’tween flecks from being hurled about owing
to the motion of the ship. Could not life-
lines have been rigged along the deck, for
instance?”
“Suppose so. Not my business. Sur-
geon’s job. ‘"vite enough to do navigating
ship. Can’t /urse convicts and navigate
same time. Impossible.”

TAKE
FOR HOLIDAY
WITH YOU
MISHAPS
ever-
It isn’t wise to go away for a holiday without a pot of Zam-Buk, the
ready healer.
Many a mishap might mar your enjoyment without Zam-Buk, whereas
with this pure first-aid you can obtain speedy relief from smarting pain,
and ward off poisoning.
Sore faces, sore feet, sunburnt skins and rough hands are sure to be prevalent,
too, and anointing with Zam-Buk should be a nightly measure with all who value
comfort and a clear, healthy skin. Zam-Buk is wonderfully soothing for sore,
aching or tender feet, and invaluable for mosquito bites and insect stings.
Zam-Buk is a healing, soothing, antiseptic skin-dressing, neatly packed and
ready for use, and as handy as it is reliable.
SUNBURN AND FRECKLES-
Miss Doris Wells, 271 Brisbane
Street, Launceston, Tas., says:—“l
suffered from skin blemishes and
freckles. Having heard of'Zam-Buk's
great value for skin aenfplaints I
thought I would try it. I purchased
a pot of Zam-Buk, and massaged the
balm well into the skin twice daily.
In a short time the blemishes disap-
peared, leaving iny skin perfectly
clear. .
“During an outing some of our
family got terribly sunburnt. When
Zam-Buk was applied the irritation
was quickly alleviated. Zam-Buk pre-
vented blistering, and in a few days
the exposed skin was as healthy as
ever.’’
SORE FEET.
Mr. Walter Robinson, of
288 Palmer Street, Sydney,
says:—“l suffer terribly
from tender feet, which
get so fearfully hot that
at times my suffering is
unbearable. I have found
that for cooling and sooth-
ing the feet Zam-Buk ia
wonderful. After washing
my feet i always massage
them with Zam-
Buk, which has
a delightfully
cooling
result.”
ZAM-BUK soothes and heals all
those nasty skin troubles so pre-
valent in Summer, such asPimples>
Chafed Feet, Sunburn, Raw Per-
spiring Surfaces, Rashes; and is
invaluable for Cuts, Bruises,
Burns, Scalds, Ringworm,
Barber’s Rash, and injured or
unhealthy conditions of the skin.
Obtainable from all chemists and
stores at 1/6 per pot, or 3/6
family size; post free from C. E.
Fulford (Aus.)j Etd., 39 Pitt
Street, Sydney.
PRICKLY HEAT.
Mrs. J. A. Richardson, First Avenue,
St. Peters, Adelaide, says:—“A rash,
which I think was prickly heat, came
out all over me, and painful hard
lumps formed. While this lasted T
could get very little rest, but on
using Zam-Buk my skin was soothed
and I was very quickly eased of dll
irritability. Zam-Buk completely
cured me.”
BITTEN BY SANDFLIES.
Mrs. G. Balmer, of 13 George
Street, Burwood, Sydney, writes: —
“Twelve months ago sores broke out
on my son’s legs, as a result of being
bitten by sandflies. These sores
assume the appearance of large boils.
Not until we used Zam-Buk did his
condition improve. Under the Zam-
Buk treatment the inflammation sub-
sided, the wounds became clean, and
after about a month’s treatment Jack’s
legs were quite better.”

“Can you inform me as to why the sur-
geon did not take requisite precautions ?
"Yes.” . . '
“And what is your explanation, sir t
“Too d—d drunk. D —d drunken lout.
Always well fuddled.”
This was too much for Macquarie. He
knew well that the captain was right it
was the surgeon-superintendent’s duty to
look after the safety of the prisoners. But
that this truculent little seaman should dare
to swear in his presence was outrageous. It
was almost unbelievable.
“Sir!” he rapped out.
“Just what I said. D —d drunken
sweep!”
“Captain Denison” —with great dignity—
“you forget where you are. You forget
whom you are addressing. I am not accus-
tomed to the use of strong language in my
presence, sir.”
“Can’t express myself without it. D—d
if I can.”
‘,‘You will endeavor to do so here, sir.”
Macquarie was thoroughly angry. His quaint
face wore that expression of outraged sever-
ity which few people who had called it into
being did not remember with regret. “I
wish to know, sir, whether the lamentable
state of affairs amongst the unfortunate con-
victs on board the ship you command could
not have been avoided. You accuse the sur-
geon—Dr. James—of habitual drunkenness.
A very serious charge—which I may call
upon you to substantiate.”
“A drunken wastrel. I”
“Be silent, sir.”
Captain Denison glared at Macquarie, the
muscles of his strong jaws bulging and work-
ing beneath the skin. Macquarie glared at
the Captain, his face black with wrath. For
a good half-minute neither spoke. Then'
the Governor, swallowing liis anger with
obviously painful effort, went on.
“Between yourself and Dr. James the
blame rests for the injuries which these men
have sustained. You will, if you please,
write me a report bearing upon the subject.
I will send for the surgeon and hear what
he has to say. On my decision between you
will be based my report to the Board of
Transport. I shall require your report with
the shortest possible delay. Not a word, sir!
You will please to remember that you are
in the presence of the representative of his
Majesty the King in these Territories, sir.
And, I may add, of the Court of Vice-
Admiralty as well. Bear that in mind, Cap-
tain Denison. Bear that in mind. I wish
you good morning, sir.”
Captain Denison rose, furious, bowed sar-
castically to the Governor, and strode to-
wards tbe door. Half-way there he seemed
to recollect something, turned, and came
back to face Macquarie’s hostile glare.
“Forgot something. Got a request to
make,” he spat at the Governor.
“Well, sir?”
“We brought out five female prisoners.
One of them, Mistress Emily Carson. Wish
to marry her. Wish take her back to Eng-
land. If you give her free pardon, can do
so. Pardon necessary. Can’t be done with-
out. Hope you will do so.”
Macquarie stared at the little man in the
utmost astonishment. What was this? In-
solence, effrontery, contempt of his high
office? Incredible! Preposterous! The man
must be insane.
“What!” he gasped.
“Want to marry this woman. Take her
away. You give her free pardon.”
Then the storm burst.
“Your amazing impudence, sir!” raged
the Governor. “By Heavens, it over-
whelms me —overwhelms me. I send for
you to answer certain questions—and
you are distinctly insolent, sir. Un-
mistakably insolent. You make use of bad
language in my presence. In my presence,
sir! And then you have the unparalleled,
the unbelievable, impudence to make such a
request as you have just made! Good God,
sir, you must be mad! Insane! In need
of restraint! No, I shall not consider your
outrageous proposal for a moment, sir. Leave
the room instantly, Captain Denison. You
.had better be careful, sir. Very careful.”
“You mean it? You won’t?” snapped the
little sailor.
Macquarie banged his fist upon the table.
“Leave the room, sir!”
“D—d Jack-in-office!” shouted Captain
Denison, as he turned towards the door.
His Excellency was on his feet in an in-
stant, pale with fury. “Mr. Campbell!” he
called loudly—“ Mr. Campbell!”
The door opened with a suspicious sud-
denness, as though the Secretary had not
been far away from its other side.
“Your Excellency?”
“Mr. Campbell, I am putting Captain
Denison under arrest. Call the orderly on
duty, and then send for the corporal of
the guard and a file of soldiers. I will make
out a warrant for the committal of this —•
■ this person to prison. I will show you, sir,
that you cannot come here and indulge in
gross impertinence to the Governor-General
of this territory. Not a word, sir. Not
a word!”
But Captain Denison was incapable of
utterance. He could only stand and glare
at Macquarie. He was quite speechless—
deadly pale and trembling with the inarticu-
late intensity of his rage.
“Verra good, yoUr Excellency,” murmured
Mr. Campbell, a little awe^-stricken.
# * * •
“ ’Tis an awful thing, Mistress Carson,
for to think of that good little man a-frettin’
his sowl to tatters in that stinkin’ prison.
A terrible thing, so it is.”
Mr. Moriarty, the big, red, handsome
chief officer of the brig Anemone, was walk-
ing in George-street, opposite the gaol, with
the beautiful object of Captain Denison’s
infatuation. Whenever he came ashore it
was to hang about the dungeon of his unfor-
tunate friend, or to waste his time haunt-
ing Mr. Campbell’s office in a vain attempt
to have a word with the Governor on his be-
half. His blue eyes were full of trouble;
his kindly, cheerful face was set in lines
of anxious gloom that were unnatural enough
to it.
“ ’Tis devil an inch he’ll budge, ayther.
Not an inch. Whin I took him Macquarie’s
ultimatum—as that Scotch rascal Campbell
gave it to me, a-grinnin’ all over his face—
how he’d stop where he was till he axes
pardon, he up an’ cursed me bitter, so he
did. ‘Out o’ this,’ he says, ‘ye calamity.
Coming here wid y’r d- —d insults,’ he says.
‘T’ hell wid ye,’ he says; ‘an' t’ hell wid
that ould on th’ hill yonder! I’d
sooner rot here a gennyration,’ he says,
‘than I’d apollygise to such a blarsted old
two-yards-o’-pumpwater.’ ’Tis that way he's
feelin’, an’ I dunno what’s to be done. I
dunno at all, at all.”
“ ’Tis very tiresome,!’ said the beauty
carelessly, stifling a yawn. “ ’Tis unplea-
sant in there, 1 do not doubt. Cold in this
weather. He’d better send a civil w r ord to
Mr. Macquarie.”
“True for you. dear lady. But ’tis not
anny rayson at all he’ll be listnin’ to. Now,
as I say, if y’r lovely silf would but go an’
shpake th’ soft wor-rud —’tis you he might
be hadin’. Now, will ye not do it? lie’s
allowed his visitors. Come wid me now,
dear lady. Come. ’Twill be but foive
minits, that’s all.”
She laughed merrily—and a little harshly.
“Oh, la, la—my dear Mr. Moriarty, you
amuse me. Let me tell you my position is
such that I cannot go a-visiting prisoners in
the common gaol. ’Twould never do! ’Tis
quite out of the question.”
“But ’tis over you he’s there!” protested
the honest Irishman. “ ’Twas but rage wid
him on your account made him act rude to
th’ Gov’nor.”
“Oh, dear me,” she simpered, “you must
know, Mr. Moriarty, that I’ve been ap-
pointed housekeeper to Mr. Crawford, the
Superintendent of Convicts. I’m sure so
genteel a person as he is would not approve
my visiting Sydney Gaol. Oh, gracious me,
no! Quite out of the question.”
Startled, the mate halted, and turned to
look at her. “ ’Tis to big Bill Crawford’s
ye’re goin’?”
“Yes, Mr. Moriarty,” she replied demurely.
“For to be his woman, is it?”
“Mister Moriarty, I said ‘his house-
keeper.’ ”
“An’ th’ Captain may go hang?”
“He may go to the Devil, my dear friend,”
she assented sweetly, smiling up at him.
“And you too.”
Without a word the mate turned on his
heel and left her. He strode across the
boggv roadway to the gate of the gaol,
knocked loudly and was presently admitted.
Mrs. Carson continued up the street, an
uncommon vision of loveliness in the some-
what sordid village that was Sydney in 1817.
Pacing his narrow cell —four steps along
and four back again—Captain Denison was
endeavoring to keep warm, but when the
door was opened by Gaoler Sam Briggs for
Mr. Moriarty, his nose was blue and his
teeth chattered in spite of himself.
“Skipper,” said the mate cheerfully, “I’ve
come for to relase ye !”
“Wh-what!” shivered Captain Denison.
“Has that tvrant th-thought better of
it?”
“Not yet. But ’tis y’silf that’s a-goin’ to,
Captain, dear —an’ thin so will he.”
“Me! I’m not going to crawl to the d —d
sawney.”
“Ye’ve been fooled. Pat Dinnyson. Y’r
lady love’s off wid another man. ’Tis little
use worryin’ about her. She’s but just
a-tellin’ me how ye might go to th’ Divil,
an’s gone off to th’ head man over th’ con-
victs. For th’ love o’ Mary, get out of it
afore she comes into her power—or 'tis in
a chain-gang ye'll find y'silf.”
He told of the lovely Emily’s defection.
Captain Denison received the news with
bitter profanity.
“All right.-’ lie said at last, after a little
further sound and fervent exhortation on
the part of Mr. Moriarty; “take this to
Macquarie.”
He hastily scribbled a note on a leaf of
his pocket-book, and handed it to his faith-
ful and delighted friend. This was his
amende honorable:
Sir, —-Ye may go to the Devil. I desire to Apolo-
gise for having named ye a Jack-in-offis and for mv
Dang-age of Yesterday’s date. I despise ye.
Yours, Patrick Denison. Sydney Jail, Jy. 30.
“I have never,” he said bitterly to Mr.
Moriarty, “done such an abject thing before.
That woman has broken my heart. Take
that to the —— Governor, and tell
him to go to Hell!”
It was the diplomatic Mr. Campbell who
saved the situation. Taking the note from
Mr. Moriarty, he sought Macquarie. “I have
a communication from Captain Denison,
your Excellency,” he said. “He’s verra con-
trite, an’ makes full an’ handsome apology.
Will ye sign an order for his release? His
first-officer is waiting.”
Macquarie looked up from one of Mr.
Francis Howard Greenway’s architectural
designs, in which he had been absorbed.
“Captain Denison —let me see, Denison?
Oh, ah —yes, Mr. Campbell. Write an order
and I will sign it. He has been taught his
lesson, then? Oh, yes—let him go. I de-
spise such creatures. But they must not
presume—they must not be permitted to pre-
sume, my dear Campbell.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITHIN these walls no votive altars
stand,
Here will you find nor priest nor
neophyte
To keep red flames of sacrifice alight;
None of the cult our man-made gods demand.
’Tis but a workshop human minds have
planned
For human needs, a watch-tower in our
night;
Yet none the less a temple in His sight,
Who best is served with heart and brain
and hand.
For we may make of each such place a
shrine,'
Wherein, devoutly, diligently sought,
God’s presence is revealed; where human
thought
Holds intimate high converse with divine;
And where, in golden moments, men have
caught
A glimpse of His ineffable design.

REFRIGERATING AND
ICE-MAKING MACHINERY.
While the Greatest Selling factor in our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN' RUNNING —which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.” Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of your
plant, not only to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
aii initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your service.

RENDROCR
(RACRAROCR)
Users of this favorite and economical compound will be pleased to learn that, after five years’ interruption
owing to war, we have now recommenced the manufacture of its ingredients.
Users of Rendrock “manufacture” their own explosive only when wanted. This avoids the risk of
deterioration and the danger of storing nitro-glycfri,ne compounds.
Rendrock ingredients are perfectly harmless to keep on your premises until manufactured, that is, combined by
dipping the cartridge in the liquid.
Rendrock has greater rending power than the strongest gelignite.
